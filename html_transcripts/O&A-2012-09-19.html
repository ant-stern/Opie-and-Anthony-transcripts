<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in their characteristically vulgar and sexually explicit banter.  They expressed disappointment at Penny Marshall's cancellation of a scheduled appearance, attributing it to perceived arrogance and poor attendance at her book tour events. The conversation then pivoted to a lengthy discussion of the Memphis Three, specifically Damien Echols, his release from death row, and the controversies surrounding his case.  The hosts analyzed the *Paradise Lost* documentaries, the Alford plea, and their opinions on the legal system and the prosecution's perceived flaws.  Upcoming documentaries and a movie related to the case were also mentioned.  A subsequent segment detailed one host's experience at a Pearl Jam concert, sparking a discussion about the band and Eddie Vedder's political views.  The show’s bizarre conclusion involved a fixation on petting a wolf seen on Fox News across the street, leading to frantic planning and phone calls to attempt this unusual feat.  Anecdotes about previous unusual animal encounters at the studio – tigers, monkeys, and a near-introduction of a baby elephant – were also shared.


The show continued with the hosts jokingly referencing a staff member's search for a "wolf thing." This transitioned into a crude discussion of the Space Shuttle Endeavor's final flight and the state of the American space program.  The conversation then veered into a discussion about tornadoes, including a ludicrous method for tornado prevention involving nudity and a bottle of Jack Daniels.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to playing and critiquing a Van Halen music video, interspersed with more off-color jokes.  A guest then provided a summary of a 2016 Barack Obama documentary, prompting the hosts' criticisms of Obama's father, associates, political affiliations, and choices.  The discussion then turned to the 2012 presidential election, analyzing clips of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama's speeches and media coverage.

Damien Echols then joined the show as a guest, along with his wife Lori. He discussed his new book, his wrongful imprisonment, and graphic details about prison conditions, including abuse from guards.  He recounted his experience with solitary confinement, lack of medical care, and the illnesses he suffered. Echols detailed the prosecutorial motivations behind his Alford plea, his adoption of meditation to cope with trauma, and the difficulties readjusting to life outside of prison.  He described the support he received from people like Henry Rollins and mentioned the ongoing efforts to overturn his conviction and obtain previously unseen FBI files.  He also discussed his relationship with Lori, the emotional toll of his teenage writings being used against him, and a falling out with Jason Baldwin. He mentioned a book signing with Johnny Depp.


Further discussion included Jerry Lawler's heart attack and recovery, and the cancellation of a planned segment with a caller named Lady Di.  The hosts also discussed an upcoming appearance by Carl Urban and speculated about Lawler's wrestling return.  More commentary on Echols' interview and frustration over Lady Di's absence concluded this segment. Profanity and banter were consistent throughout.


A subsequent segment began with a discussion about a Jimmy Kimmel skit on the iPhone 5, followed by criticism of *The Big Bang Theory*.  The hosts then discussed frequent caller Bobo, his online interactions with fake female accounts, and his password revelations. An Australian fan, Corey, and a previous studio visit by a woman impersonating a Canadian girlfriend for a Bobo bit were mentioned.  Further Bobo-related plans were discussed, including a potential return involving a "Toddlers & Tiaras" themed costume. A pre-recorded "Lessons in Understanding" segment with Andrew Dice Clay, featuring a rant against a female comic, was aired.  The absence of the scheduled guest, Lady Di, was again noted.

The main part of the segment involved an in-studio interview with Carl Urban promoting *Dredd 3D*.  The conversation covered Urban's career, accents, and the secrecy surrounding *Star Trek*.  Speculation about the upcoming *Star Trek* movie and Khan's role was discussed, with Urban remaining tight-lipped.  Details about the cast and plot of *Dredd 3D* were provided.  The segment concluded with another call from Bobo.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Arby and Earth show.  What ever before has one radio show been so extreme?  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So, from that you learned. 
[00:00:30]  We were just farting.  I did, but I didn't know it started.  Like rotten egg from sillard.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the ground. 
[00:01:00]  Would you like to make the fucking second?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  Just pay us, you assholes!  I will continue!  Anthony, the rage.  Shut the fuck up!  Come to my pool and drown in it.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good fucking morning, everybody.  Ooh, hell no.  Language.  Pump day, right?  That's what they call it, Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday, right?  What is that?  Whip them out Wednesday, right?  What's that?  I'm not giving up.  I know, right?  People have been tweeting me their old bumper stickers. 
[00:02:00]  I still see the bumper stickers.  And I'll say it again, it warms my heart.  Isn't it good?  It warms my cockles.  Your cockles.  My cockles.  What the fuck?  What's a cockle?  Hi, everybody.  Penny.  Oh, I wanted to do the Penny Marshall.  So I just realized I can't do it.  Penny Marshall.  Oh, she's not coming in today.  I'm canceling all my morning press.  Oh, where's Roland? 
[00:02:30]  I'm canceling my morning press today.  I guess she was a real bitch yesterday around here.  I heard she was walking around like queen shit.  Well, this is what these people, and they've been in Hollywood a long time, but I'll still  say it.  They're really stupid.  She did a book tour yesterday for her dumb book.  And she did like book, radio, all these channels that I swear to you, I don't think anyone  listens.  Book radio!  I mean no one. 
[00:03:00]  I mean like zero fucking listeners.  Yeah.  And then the second day of her book tour is us, Howard Stern, and she cancels the second  day.  The second day.  I'm calm.  I'm exhausted.  I need a rest.  I don't feel good.  She would have reached way more people doing our show, Howard's show, than dumb book radio.  What else did she do yesterday, Roland?  Mark says hi.  She'd be like-  What the fuck is a Mark says hi?  Mark says hi. 
[00:03:30]  What time did she come here?  I don't like Mark says hi.  During the day?  I know it's a bad impression, but it's fun to do, so fuck everyone.  It's hilarious.  It's a perfect impression.  Mark says hi.  What the fuck is Mark says hi?  Exactly.  I don't know.  What is Mark says hi?  He walks around and goes, hi, I'm Mark says hi.  Yeah, it's all play on words for a while.  The dumbest radio name ever.  Yeah.  And I know we've never talked about this, so fuck you, Sam, too.  Because I see you giving me a look like, you've already done this.  I wasn't even looking at you.  Oh, all right. 
[00:04:00]  And I'm a little suspicious today of everyone.  You're on high alert.  Am I being taped?  What's going on?  We're very defensive today.  Mark says hi.  Mark says hi.  I did his show.  I did bulk radio.  Huh?  Yeah, he does comedy interviews.  He does.  I'm sure he's a nice guy, but his name's stupid, and that's coming from Opie.  Whoa.  But I'm stuck with his stupid name.  Yeah, I don't like his name either.  Mark says hi.  I heard she was very, very boring yesterday.  Oh, she's a bore, too, Roland?  That's what I heard.  From Mark says hi. 
[00:04:30]  I was running around with my Indiana Jones hat and whip, so.  None of them probably knew how to.  I read, like, the first five pages of it, just because I was much more into the Damien  Echols book.  Yeah.  And the story that she opened was really interesting.  Like, I'm bummed she canceled.  What, her mom's crazy or something?  I haven't even gotten that far.  It was just literally about her.  I think that's the name of the book.  My mom's nuts.  My mom is nuts.  Yeah.  So I would assume that means her mom's a bit crazy.  Two guys broke into her house and robbed her with a sword.  Oh.  And I would like them.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Roland.  So what happened, Roland?  She was tired and.  At the end of it, she was too tired.  And canceled her second day.  Canceled all the morning press.  But wouldn't today be the shows to do?  Yeah.  She didn't know she was going to be tired until after yesterday.  Yeah.  She probably went with all these dumb, boring shows and decided, I'm not coming back for this.  Kirk.  Yeah.  She was done around close to four.  Four.  What dumb shows did she do?  Mars is High, Book Radio.  She did a bunch.  I'm not sure what other shows.  The Book Radio lady eyeballs me. 
[00:05:30]  She wants some kind of confrontation.  I'm like, no, it's not going to happen.  Did she do Judith?  I don't care about it.  How do you even know what she looks like?  It's Pia, right?  Yeah.  Pia or something?  Yep.  Pia.  That brought eyeballs me.  I wouldn't know if I passed her in the hallway.  I don't know her either.  She used to be a newswoman or something, I think, right?  Purdy?  No.  Pia...  But she eyeballed me.  Lindstrom?  Zadora?  Yes.  Pia Lindstrom.  Yeah.  Oh, the news?  You know that lady.  I mean, I know her name.  From the news.  Now she talks about books?

[00:12:00]  But Damien Echols  From the Memphis 3  Will be in  What time is that?  8 o'clock?  8 a.m.  I had to block somebody  On Twitter last night  Because of the interview  What?  Someone tweeted  With Damien Echols  Twitter name  In there also  And said  Hey Damien  Have fun  Because Anthony  Thinks you're guilty  And if it was up to him  You'd be rotting in prison still  It's like  Really?  You fucking  Really?  Asshole?  Wow 
[00:12:30]  That ain't true  I know  You really believe that?  That's kind of crazy  People do  I get emails from people  Where they're like  No but read this  But it's like  No one has ever said anything  About the case  That has made me think  They find stuff from his past  But before the case  He was troubled  Or he did this or that  Right  But there's never been anybody  Who's shown me anything  From that case  Evidence wise  That makes me think he did it  Yeah  There's zero physical evidence  Exactly  Nothing  That's the only reason  The state let him go  They knew he was going to win  On a  Those guys would win 
[00:13:00]  On a new trial  He's one of those guys  That got lucky  Because celebrities  Kind of picked up on it  Stuck with it  Ran with it  And he really was  Innocent  But imagine how many people  Just have no voice  And are just rotting  Knowing  How fucking crazy  Must it be  Where you know  You know you didn't do it  In your own mind  You're like  Holy fuck  I so didn't do this  You're just telling people  It's like  I'm in prison for life  In this jail cell  And people are treating me horribly 
[00:13:30]  Because they think I'm a monster  I'm supposed to be executed  Holy shit  I say whatever  Our system isn't perfect  Yeah  What are you going to do  Child killer though  Not even just a murder  And a bank robber  But a fucking  Child sexual mutilator  Like that's a  It's the worst thing  You can be convicted of  Crazy  Damien Echols  Was really good on  Anderson Cooper  I didn't see any of his  Really good interview man  This guy knows how to write  He's intense looking  He's gained 60 pounds  Since leaving jail  He had to learn  How to walk again  Because of the shackles 
[00:14:00]  That he had to wear  Constantly  He got married  On death row  Which I found  Very very strange  They showed pictures  Of a very happy occasion  Because he married  That woman from Brooklyn  That I guess  Laurie  I forget her last name  Who started writing him  And they showed  The wedding pictures  On Anderson Cooper  I just found  That's so weird  Considering the circumstance  He's on death row  They're going to kill him  And there he is  Happy  Those are nice  Wedding photos  Because he's married  So you think  He displays the wedding photos  In his house 
[00:14:30]  Like and it's from death row  But it didn't look  Any worse than  Getting married in front  Of the justice of the peace  Is what I'm saying  It looked like  Just a happy moment  And then you  Have to like  Realize that  This is happening  On death row  Which was really strange  To me  That's all  Yeah  Yeah  Man  So  His book is so good  I had to do something  Yesterday  I thought I was doing today  So I'm probably  35 pages short  Of finishing it  Wow  You went right through it  Dude  I literally had to  Put it down for a day  Because I was ripping  Through it 
[00:15:00]  It was so good  It's like one of those books  Where I was like  An entire flight I read  And I don't think  I've ever done that  An entire fucking flight  Oh really  It's great  He's a good writer man  It's not just about his case  Sure  It's about life on death row  And the monotony of it  And then going back  To his childhood  And I just believe him  Like I just  People don't  And I get these emails  From people  How could you  Talk  You know  It's really hip  To talk to that murderer  Like they think  I'm not some fucking  Celebrity bandwagon jumper  Say that again  I don't mean I jump 
[00:15:30]  On celebrity bandwagon  You're correct  But I didn't  After the first one  I wasn't convinced  Of his innocence  After the original  Paradise Lost  I was like  That looks kind of fishy  But I was not  100% convinced  Right  It looked like  That one stepfather  Mark Byers  Wasn't great  In the second one  I kind of became  A little bit more convinced  That Mark Byers  Had a lot more motive  And stuff like this  Yeah  And by the third one  I'm absolutely convinced  He didn't do it  And I actually think  It was the other stepfather  That's my opinion  So the people  You know 
[00:16:00]  Calling him a murderer  And going after you  Because he's going on  Our show  I would bet  A lot of money  Didn't see any of the documentaries  Yeah  Well they saw a synopsis  Of them  Yeah  I bet you they didn't  Really do their own research  This world is exhausting  Dealing with those idiots  Yeah  It's like  They're just idiots  In the end  They're just idiots  Go away  No one wants to be around you  Mark Byers  One of the fathers  Who had been the most vocal  Yeah  Was actually at  His  When they were released  And he said  The fact that they had to 
[00:16:30]  Take an Alfred plea  Was bullshit  And that they were innocent  And he goes  Because he knows  There's still a guilty guy  Out there  Who killed his kid  The Alfred plea  We were just talking about  Before the show  Is very  Very interesting  These guys had to  Basically sign a piece of paper  That said they're guilty  It's where you get up  And just cry  You start crying  Boo  Get it  Master Wayne  Master Wayne  It's called the pissy eye plea  But it's interesting  Because  It's a way around the system  Because  The state doesn't want to be sued 
[00:17:00]  So you sign a piece of paper  That says I'm guilty  And they release you  On time served  Or whatever  It's a technicality  Because they don't want you  Suing the fucking state  For millions  Because these guys  Would have a great case  And they would  They would fucking  Just fucking make bank  Right  Yeah  So I don't  I don't know how I feel  About this thing  This law  Because  I think  I think there's a lot of people  That are rotting in jail  That they know are innocent  But they don't want to  Fucking take their cases  Because they know  Eventually they're going to  Lose a shitload of money  When they sue the state  I think it's good for them  That they have it 
[00:17:30]  That it exists  But I think it's despicable  Oh it is so despicable  Don't get me wrong  Yeah it's terrible  But I wonder if  These guys would have  Even saw the light of day  If they didn't have  The Alfred law  Well I think the only reason  They saw the light of day  Was because  The Alfred law  They allowed them to use  They would have probably  Been in jail for another  Two years  But they  It looked like  Their convictions  Because the same  Shitty judge  Was just constantly  Denying everything  Right  He was finally gone  They came with DNA evidence  There was zero  Zero physical evidence 
[00:18:00]  Connecting them to the crime  Zero  They had pathologists  I think they were  Or odontologists  That were coming in  And saying  That those scratches  That they thought  Were satanic worship  Were actually animal scratches  Because these kids  Were in the woods  Right  And animal  Start scratching them  Yeah and they made  A very good case for that  Wow  And there was one little  Piece of hair  Found in one of the shoelaces  And it was  I think it was a mustache hair  Of a stepfather  Who hadn't been talked about  At all  In Terry Hobbs  Crazy  Now again  That may be because 
[00:18:30]  The kids knew each other  And one of his hair  Was on the kid  That would not  That's why the state  Didn't go after him  Because they don't have  Enough evidence  To convict  This other guy  And he was saying  That he had not seen  The boys that day at all  And one of his neighbors  Came out and said  He's lying  I saw him with them  Right  They were all riding  Their bikes  He has notes  For two hours  Or two and a half hours  He has zero  Corroborating witnesses  For his alibi  Right  So he looks like  A very likely suspect  It doesn't mean  He would get convicted 
[00:19:00]  But the state  By releasing these guys  It's even more devious  Than just money  That's part of it  But part of it  Is also  These prosecutors  Become obsessed  With their record standing  And not being  Right  Losing  And you would have to  Say that everything  That they did was wrong  And the prosecution  Was wrong  And being right  Is more important  To these guys  Than serving justice  Of course  And it's terrible  It's despicable  That these guys  Aren't allowed to sue  It's horrible  But I mean  It probably got them  Out of jail  Faster  I don't know  I wonder if a pardon  Like I don't think  A president can pardon them 
[00:19:30]  But is there any kind  Of a pardon  That would nullify  The Alford deal  I'd pardon you  And then they could  Go after the state  How many states  Have the Alford law  That I don't know  And I don't know  The case that  Caused it to happen  It's obviously  A guy named Alford  But I don't know what  Because you know  I mean  You know they're  You know they want to  Hide fucking  Some of these people  That are in jail  Because they know  It'll cost way too much  Fucking money  In lawsuits  Well did you see them  When they made their pleas  That you're allowed  To say you're innocent first 
[00:20:00]  Like you are  Like you say  It's a weird technicality  Innocent of this crime  Yeah but I'm taking this plea  It's in my own best interest  To accept this plea  You're not admitting murder  Wow what a weird law  Just so the fucking state  Doesn't have to be embarrassed  And doesn't have to look bad  And doesn't have to pay money  And have to deal with a lawsuit  And doesn't have to look for  A fucking killer  After they destroy your life  Yeah  It's fucking horrible  That the state  Is so worried about that stuff  Right  Instead of doing the right thing  That's what the law  Is supposed to be  What if it's a way  To get some of these guys  Out of jail  That are innocent  Yeah  You know what I mean 
[00:20:30]  The end justifies the means  What are you going to do  I like to say  All the time  Because the state's not going  To do the right thing  For you  Right  Never  If they know in their hearts  That oh fuck  We convicted the wrong fucking guy  They're not going to do  The right thing  There's no fucking way  And they would fight  And the great part  Is in the end  Of the third documentary  They are continually  Denied  Denied  And they had this new  Evidence  Which is  It just simply is  That he was petitioning  For a hearing  And the hearing  Would have allowed  The new evidence  Which was DNA evidence  To be introduced  Now Arkansas has a law 
[00:21:00]  Which says that  If there's a certain amount  Of DNA evidence  The court must now look  At all the evidence  Together  And see if it  If it warrants a new trial  Right  The fuck  And of course  I think his name was  Burnett or whatever  The original judge said  No  Carol  Carol Burnett  It's a very wacky trial  Yeah  Yeah  Mr. Todd Ball  The bailiff  And then  So they go to the  Arkansas Supreme Court  And you could see  That these judges  Were irritated  At the state  Because the guys 
[00:21:30]  Their argument was  This is how fucking  Despicable the state can be  Was well  Your honor  We think that this  New law  Or whatever it was  That says  DNA evidence  Entered  Means all evidence  Could be examined  Only means all evidence  Indicating guilt  They didn't think  All evidence  If it was  If it was going to  Exonerate you  Right  And the judges  Are like  What's the harm  What  Did one of the judges  But what is the harm  In looking at all the evidence  All the evidence  And this guy  Look  This fucking state whore 
[00:22:00]  Is just doing his job  But he's like  I've never seen a lawyer  Fumble like this  He's like  Well your honor  And he's just double talking  And the guy goes  I'm not following you  And you could see  That they were going to  That they were going to lose  Right  And the state lost  And then  They were going to be granted  An evidentiary hearing  That's what  There was no new trial set  But it was a new judge  Because the original  Fucking trial judge  Got elected to senate  Finally  So that whore  Wasn't going to be there  It was going to be a new judge  On an evidentiary hearing  And that was when the state 
[00:22:30]  I think four months  Before that happened  Came to these guys  They're like  Oh boy  Or maybe the lawyers  Contacted them  But they saw the writing  On the wall  Fuck man  You know a lot about this case  Well I watched it recently  And I've seen all the documentaries  But it's very interesting  Fascinating  Fascinating  Absolutely fascinating  Especially when  I loved watching those  The Arkansas Supreme Court  Who had  The Arkansas Supreme Court  Had two times before  Denied him  So they had said no  To Eccles twice  With all of them  Right  And watching these judges  Question this fucking attorney 
[00:23:00]  And he had nothing  He really didn't  Because he's just double talking  His mouth is dry  He had that shit  Oh yeah yeah yeah  He did yeah  But to literally  But to stand there  And the one judge  Has asked that beautiful  Common sense question  What's the harm  In looking at it  Like if there's such  A strong push for this  And if new DNA  Because the original  They had a knife  That Mark Byers  The original kooky stepfather  Who looked guilty  But turned out not to be  Had given the HBO filmmakers 
[00:23:30]  As a gift  And there was a little blood  In the fold of it  Dried blood  So they said to him  Where'd this blood come from  And he goes  Oh I don't know  It's not human blood  So of course  The HBO documentary makers  Gave this to the police  The police did  Very rudimentary DNA tests  Back then  Which said  It could be one of the kids  Jesus  Or it could be  It was inconclusive  Right  I think as to who  The blood belonged to  So it wasn't  They weren't able  To do anything with it  Oh the other thing  On the Anderson Cooper interview 
[00:24:00]  There's going to be  A documentary coming out  That Damien and his  His brother are working on  Jesus  Oh okay  Yeah  Yeah good  I know him and Jason  They're working on that  It's coming out  Like with new evidence  And all that crap  So  There's been a falling out  Between him and Jason  Which one's Jason  The guy we  Jason's the one we talked to  Over something of our documentary  That's going to be done too  But not that one  I want to ask without  Because I haven't read that part yet  Yeah  Have those guys seen each other  Oh yeah  And Jason and Jesse 
[00:24:30]  We had Jason in  Jason we had in  Jason Baldwin  But they didn't want to take  The Jason especially  Wanted to keep fighting  I think because they knew  They were going to be acquitted  But Jason didn't want  To admit guilt  He didn't want the  Alfred plea  Probably because he knew  He couldn't sue as well  Right  But with Damien on death row  They just couldn't chance it  Because his life was at stake  Jesus  And that to me  Is where it's  Fucking blackmail  It literally was  Fucking blackmail  By the state  Why was he on death row  And the other guys weren't  He was just seen  Miss Kelly was given 
[00:25:00]  Life plus 40  Which was life  Life plus 20 and 20  Because again  I guess he was the confessor  And Jason Baldwin  Wasn't seen as the ringleader  They just  You know  At any time of  Three people  They give one guy  The ringleader  He was the weirdest looking one  He was kind of the goth guy  He was the one  Who had tried to run away  With his girlfriend  And like he was  The likely  He was the more  I guess appealing  Ringleader target  Right right  He fit the bill  Of the crazy 
[00:25:30]  Goth  Satanic  Worshipper guy  And he did himself  No service  Would you watch that  Old Testament  And he'll probably say that  Smug  And not giving good answers  Like the lawyer says to him  Did you kill Christopher Byers  No I did not  Did you kill  I forget the other  Children's names  Blah blah blah  No I did not  No I did not  Like he gave the correct  Legal answers  But there was no  Emotion  He didn't seem to me  Like that's not the way  An innocent  Like no  God please  I didn't  But when you look back  He was just an 18 year old 
[00:26:00]  Kid  Yeah  Who all of a sudden  Is fighting for his life  And he said  And even  Jesse Miss Kelly  Who confessed  Said  That they never thought  They'd be convicted  Because you can't prove  We did something  That we didn't do  Like to them  It was out of the realm  Of possibility  Right  If you know  You didn't do something  It just seems like  No I didn't do this  So when do I go home  And Jesse Miss Kelly  I think even though he confessed  Because he's retarded  Was fucking  Out of  Was actually wrestling  He was away wrestling  Which I think 
[00:26:30]  Could have been proven  I mean it's just  Such nonsense  And terrible police work  Am I missing anything Travis  Because Travis does a lot  You were  You were talking about  The documentary  That he's producing  Which is called  West of Memphis  And that's  He produced it  And Peter Jackson  From Lord of the Rings  Oh right  Wow  He got fucking  Peter Jackson  Peter Jackson  Paid millions of dollars  In their defense fund  And that didn't come out  Until they were released  But he was  He was a huge supporter  And he still is  So yeah  We gotta get ourselves  Fucking thrown in jail man  Then our careers  Will skyrocket  So yeah 
[00:27:00]  That's coming out  In December  And then  The movie that's  That's caused the rift  Between him and Jason  Is called  Devil's Knot  Right  Which is a Hollywood  Adaptation of  Of a book  That was written about them  And Reese Witherspoon  Is  Reese Witherspoon  She's playing Pam  She's playing  Oh Jesse Miskelly  Oh Pam Hopp  Was an interesting one  And I firmly believe  That  It's simply an opinion  But I firmly believe  That her husband  Had something to do with it  But that's just  John Douglas  The FBI profiler  Was saying 
[00:27:30]  Because he looked  At the crime scene  And he was saying  This absolutely  Was not the work  Of teenagers  It's too sophisticated  A killing  Because like  The clothes were  Underwater  Stuck in the mud  With a stick  Zero blood  At the scene  This is not a teenage  This is a man  With a violent past  And then they go over  Terry Hobb's past  Oh yeah  And he had  Some violent incidents  In his past  Because he sued  One of the Dixie Chicks  The one stepfather  Stued the Dixie Chicks  Because she had said  Something stupid  Like you know  He's guilty  Or whatever  Right  So he sued her  But by doing that 
[00:28:00]  I think it opened him up  To questions legally  Cross examination  Sometimes when you sue  For something  You do open yourself up  To a line of questioning  That you're not going to be happy  Yeah because then  You have to be deposed  And during that deposition  They can ask you  Whatever the fuck  And they did  Oh boy  And boy  Did he have inconsistencies  But Pam's another one  Who completely supports them now  And she actually thinks  That he might be involved  She's like  It wouldn't surprise me  If he was involved  People are asking  Who are you talking about  Fuck  Damien Echols  Oh I'm sorry guys  That is three  No people are just tuning in 
[00:28:30]  Just tuning in  Damien Echols  We got the big interview  With him and his book  Today at 8 o'clock  So  More importantly Travis  How does Eddie Vedder  Fit into this whole thing  It's amazing  That's why Travis likes them  I get that so much on Twitter  Like oh you only like it  Because Eddie Vedder  Did Eddie write a song  About these guys  Yeah  Which one  I don't remember the name of it  How do you know  What kind of fan are you  If Ozzy wrote a song  About to about to remember  You don't know which song 
[00:29:00]  No  I said Damien co-wrote  The lyrics to it  Oh did he  Oh he co-wrote a song  With Eddie Vedder  How cool is that  Very cool  Wow  And it's probably good  We've really got to get ourselves  Thrown in jail  I'm telling you  Let's follow this model  To success  Oh shit  That's a tough model to follow  Fuck Peter Jackson  Eddie Vedder  He said in one documentary  He was raped  I don't think it works out  All the time  Whoa  He said he was raped 
[00:29:30]  For a year  I think  Oh man  In jail  Yeah or multiple times  I think in the second documentary  It came out  That he said that  I wanted to  The sisters  I'm curious if that's true  Wow  Or if that was not  That sucks  Hold on a second  He said  Repaid Peely for a year  And the guards  Did nothing to stop it  Of course not  But he really  More than the other prisoners  He bashes the guards  Like he hates  Where's the stepfather  These days  Lousy screw  Who's stepfather  The dude  Oh Mark Byers  He was six  That six foot eight 
[00:30:00]  Crazy fucking guy  I think he's still around  I mean there's a picture  Of him at a festival  With Damien  And Pam Hobbs  No the guy they're suspicious of  That guy  He wrote a blog  Terry Hobbs  Terry Hobbs  Sorry I forgot his name  For a second  He's saying that  He lives  He lives I still think  In Arkansas  And one of the other fathers  Believes Terry Hobbs  Didn't do it  He says  I think I read  A snippet of a blog  Posting  And the guy goes  Our sons were friends  They hung out all the time  If there was one of his  Like hairs  On a shoelace  That was  Happened to be  He goes  That's not  And that never would have  Been enough 
[00:30:30]  To convict him  Never would have been enough  But they were found  Three of them were bound  With shoelaces  And John Douglas  Was saying that  Again just in his  FBI profiler  Opinion  That this was somebody  Who knew these kids  Who killed them  Let me ask you this  How the fuck was  Is it possible  For one guy to kill  Three eight year olds  Very easy  Probably because  I don't know man  Have you been to a  Fucking playground  You can't  You can't corral  Three eight year olds  Come here  Come here  Come here  Come here  I think they all  Technically died  Of blows to the head  And you know  Who raised a good point  Was the other stepfather 
[00:31:00]  Mark Byers  Who made a little list  Of things that were  In support of Terry  Hobbs' innocence  And things that were  Against it  And one of the things  His little fucking chart  But one of the things  On the chart  That made it look like  A guy might be innocent  Is restraining three victims  How do you do that  But then he said  The thing to do was  If you hit one of them  As soon as the other two  Saw that  They all step in line  What eight year olds  When you were a kid  If you were with your friend's dad  And he fucking says  Stay there  And he hits it  You're not going to move  You're going to be scared  I mean that's to me  That to me is not crazy  Because he knew them  It's a possibility 
[00:31:30]  It's just an opinion  I don't know if he did it or not  Well Damien should be  A very good interview  Yeah  I can't wait  You can't wait  This  Is it like you're meeting a celebrity  Out of anybody  We've ever had in the studio  I'm probably more excited  For this  Oh yeah  Look at his pants  So tight  Exactly  Exactly  Travis has committed  Similar crimes  I was in the forward  A penny more  Why am I not coming in  Mark says hi 
[00:32:00]  Or something  Mark says hi  You don't like his name  What  Where's beer and hot wings  Well because he's got to  He's got to walk around  And go  Hi I'm Mark says hi  You don't like that name  Horrible  It's terrible  And you burn with Satan in hell  Oh god  Did he come off like a lunatic  In that one  Yeah he didn't come off good  In the first and second one  Lighting his fire in the woods  But he man  You believe that he  And I didn't realize he was six foot eight  He was a big boy  A big monster  That is a monster  And a big crazy fucking guy 
[00:32:30]  Yeah  Well that's good  We'll do the big interview  At eight o'clock  Travis  Eighteen innings huh  Yeah  Orioles  I saw you tweeting  As I woke up  Yeah  Started the game at ten  Who'd they beat  Seattle  Okay  So the game started at ten  West Coast time  Where did it end  Three fifty five  In the morning  Imagine if you're still  Playing baseball  It's three thirty  In the morning  You're like  I woke up  I'm checking Twitter  I'm seeing you know  How the game's going  And I'm like  I think this game's still on 
[00:33:00]  Oh it's still being played  I think that's where hockey blew it  Because I used to love those marathon  Holy fuck no one scoring  Type games  I love the fact that  Baseball is  It's the only sport  That just goes until it's over  They just keep going man  Like football  Like hockey  It's like oh no  Well let's settle this  In a five minute overtime  And if no one scores  After five minutes  They will just have a shootout  Which I used to love the shootout  The shootout is the stupidest thing now  Has nothing to do with  An actual hockey game  It's almost like  Okay we quit  Let's try and win it this way  It's dumb  It was exciting at first 
[00:33:30]  But I'm not a fan at all  But my point  Baseball still will play  Right to the fucking end  18 innings  Yeah  Two games  One of which is  Pretty much a shutout  The whole game  Sitting there watching  Tied  And then they go back  And do it again today  Wow  And those are the type of games  You get really bummed out  When it finally ends  You're like oh fuck man  You know what I mean  I wanted it to be like  I wanted it to be 27  118 innings  People that stay  That was a six hour game  Right  And Seattle's terrible  So like if you're staying  As a Mariners fan  That's just dumb 
[00:34:00]  I mean  Oh my god  Really  Yeah they're not good  They're not good huh  No  I wouldn't know  Oriole the Tide for first place  Alright  Cinderella season  Cinderella season  I hope they blow the whole thing  I'm having so much fun  I don't care if they do  Is it yeah  I really don't yeah  If they don't even make the playoffs  They have a winning season  I'm completely happy  That's adorable  First time in 14 years  Can you explain this Blue Jays story  That hit  They needed the money  Oh  I mean  Unil Escobar  We support like you know  Expressing yourself 
[00:34:30]  And freedom of speech  But then there's people  That are just idiots  Yeah  He's just an idiot  Yeah  He wrote  How do you say his name  Unil Escobar  Okay  He wrote  Two areas  Maracone  On his eye black  Oh boy  And it's not like  You are gay  Maracone means faggot right  Yeah  You are gay  It just says you are gay  It loosely translates into gay  So why was he writing that  And to who  I don't know  But it's not like he's invisible  Does he have a beef with somebody  I don't know  He said  He said it was a stupid thing to do 
[00:35:00]  And then he tried to use the whole  Like my friends are gay defense  Ah that one  That's just being stupid  That's  Yeah that's not smart  They're not going to look the other way  No  You're going to get in like  Major trouble for that  He did  He got suspended for three games  Has anyone else ever written on their  I mean I think people  Under their eyes like that  Like no I'm not  Was on somebody else's  Yes you are  Goes back and forth every inning  But I mean nothing like that  That's just weird  Yeah  He has no explanation 
[00:35:30]  Was he trying to be a goofball  No he's  Well right here  He says I don't have anything  Against homosexuals  Of course  But you know  Like there's no reason  To write that  It's just weird  Cost him $87,000  Oh god  You are gay  And of course  His three day salary  Will be donated  Of course  Why would you  Oh glad  That's that  Gift sure  To gay cause  Because he wrote something  Under his eyes  They should get money  Yeah  That makes sense  That's not special  In prostitution  That's good  Yeah 
[00:36:00]  And I'm sure the statement  Will come out today  From glad  This is  We appreciate the effort  But it's not good enough  And we  You think he's gonna have to go  Through training  Maybe make one of those  It gets better commercials  Yeah cause they never stop  Oh there you go  He said it was just a joke  Just a new joke  He probably lost a bet or something  And was like  Oh no you gotta write it  Then you would think  I am gay  Right  That would be  What you'd have to write  But  Isolate that  Ah yes 
[00:36:30]  I am gay  There  Better one  I hate a pumper  Go on Chip  Fucking pud licker  Pud licker  I thought you liked  To lick the salty tip  And clean it  With your mouth  A little piece of that  Pre-cum  Connect your teeth  To the cock  And then you get  Your hand put  On the back of your head  And you're forced  All the way down  Ain't you  Chip  Go taking a little far  What's that  Taking a little joke  A little far now  Far now  Far  Army Reserve 
[00:37:00]  Is the name of the song  Yep  Yes  That he wrote  With Eddie Vedder  Yeah  Is it a good song  It's alright  Oh boy  And you're a big Pearl Jam fan  I mean  It's not that good  Not every Pearl Jam song  It's no even flow  So Jeremy Spoken  Class today  This is it  Let me hear some of that  Rock and roll music  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[00:37:30]  Oh  Never disappoint  Before the ground  That gives way  To one endless fall  It's very Eddie Vedder.  Same singing.  Fucking love his voice.  That's funny.  This is a U2 cover.  It did have that U2 guitar sound.  I love the voice.  It did have a little edge to it, right?  Yeah.  Great voice, great live band. 
[00:38:00]  Right?  I do not disagree at all.  I want to kick myself in the heart.  I'm very happy you saw them.  For waiting 20 years to see a band that I've loved for a long time.  We'll go next year.  They'll play New York next year.  So stupid.  We'll have a great time.  He leaves early.  That's fine.  I'm staying.  I didn't leave early.  You didn't?  Oh, boy.  No.  Jay-Z coming on stage.  Who gives a fuck?  I saw the concert.  Missed the whole audience?  Jay-Z, yo.  And rocking in the free world.  You know.  It's a good one.  I missed the good one.  Not as good as getting the first cab out of there. 
[00:38:30]  Nice.  I saw two and a half hours easily of the show.  Just shut up.  They're a great band live.  Holy fuck.  You've got to see them, man.  No, you've got to go see them.  I think you'd be pleasantly surprised, man.  You'd love it.  I would.  Because these guys come out.  They don't fuck around.  Like, okay, you're here to see something, and we're just going to start playing immediately.  And a half hour in, you're like, I think I've seen the whole show already.  You get that feeling like, I already have my money's worth.  Oh, wow.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  They don't fuck around.  It's like, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.  And then they fool around a little bit, then hit, hit, hit, hit, hit.  Pressing two sides in there.  Holy fuck.  Nice.  And you realize how many songs you know, too.  Yeah, they got quite a few.  Unbelievable.  I loved it.  Yes.  I have nothing bad to say about Eddie Vedder.  Even him talking to the crowd was nice.  I didn't mind it.  He's a good talker.  He's very good at interacting.  He didn't talk that long.  You know, he hates the Republicans.  He made that very clear, because he wouldn't mention them by name. 
[00:39:30]  I certainly thought he was a staunch right-wing.  The party that, I wish I could do an Eddie Vedder, that I wouldn't mention by name.  Jesus.  Is preventing you from voting.  But they're not.  Oh, God.  But that's, they're not.  I love that one.  And, uh.  They're not preventing people from voting.  We're going to play a song we haven't played in a long time.  Fucking ID.  Fuck, I want to do Eddie Vedder's voice.  Shame where?  Eddie Vedder.  Yeah, Jay does a very good actor.  Best Eddie Vedder I've heard.  The talking Eddie Vedder.  Everyone can do the singing Eddie Vedder.  You just gotta. 
[00:40:00]  Talking's tough, though.  Talking.  And he's got his mannerisms down.  Yeah, yeah.  It's hysterical.  Yep.  That's what Jay does.  He gets the whole fucking mannerism and everything.  Could a tornado knock you out of the sky?  Huh?  Helicopter, sure.  Plane, even, maybe, because it would just fucking, if it smashed the wing, I'm sure.  No, I mean me.  I live really high in the sky.  Oh, no.  There's a new trend in New York where tornadoes come around now.  Come around.  Well, I don't remember my whole life fucking tornadoes coming around, but now it seems. 
[00:40:30]  It's like two in two weeks.  It's like two in two weeks.  Well, one officially didn't touch down in Suffolk County, but I'm sitting there looking out.  I look out from my window toward Jersey, and it's like that scene from the Poseidon Adventure  when the big fucking wave, they look at the wave.  I see that shit coming, and I'm like, what the fuck is out there?  I think you're pretty safe up there.  And then I wonder if a tornado could actually knock me out of the sky.  I'm about 500 feet in the air.  You should probably say it different, though.  Like, could it pull me out of my apartment?  Could it knock me off the roof? 
[00:41:00]  You don't want to say knock me out of the sky.  That's not very childish.  But what kind of damage could it do to a fucking skyscraper?  None.  A tornado would break you in those.  I think none.  None.  Why none?  I think the fucking, like, I don't ever remember hearing of a city, a skyline, even in Tornado  Alley, getting hit by a tornado and getting, like, a lot of damage.  I think the buildings themselves kind of stop the tornado from spinning so hard.  I sure hope so.  Because I look out sometimes, and I'm like, what the fuck? 
[00:41:30]  I've never seen clouds like this.  I'm privileged to be way up in the sky.  It's a different view.  And it's like a wall of water coming.  No skylines in Tornado Alley?  Really?  There's no big cities?  That's what I was going to say.  I was going to challenge your point and say, there's no cities in the Midwest?  Not really.  Stop it.  Well, they figured out, look, we can't build skyscrapers in this area.  I think that person's right.  Because I've never heard a story of a tornado coming close to a skyscraper.  Come on.  Yeah, Oklahoma City.  There's no buildings there. 
[00:42:00]  It's all a little house on the prairie out there.  Show me one video where a tornado comes close to a skyscraper.  Yes.  I don't think I've ever seen it.  Yes.  Come on.  We had some unbelievable weather again in the world yesterday.  Love these people.  We don't get those crazy storms, but we're getting them now.  Yeah.  Must mean it's going to be a real bad winter.  I love when people have their prediction.  Well, predicting a horrible winter, and then it's fine.  Then once in 30 years when it's bad, they go, see, I told you.  This guy's saying it's going to do damage and mess up the apartment. 
[00:42:30]  That's fine, but is it going to knock me out of the sky?  Knock you out of the sky.  So, Ant, you don't believe in the farmer's almanac?  No, the dumb farmer's almanac.  Farmer!  No.  No.  Wow, the phones are lit.  People have an opinion on me being knocked out of the sky.  People are idiots.  Why are they idiots?  I don't know.  There are people.  It's crazy what gets people to call, because you spend an hour talking about a guy who  was on death row over 18 years.  Memphis 3, they didn't even give a fuck.  And now people are wondering.  And how Jimmy talked about it, I was, like, enthralled. 
[00:43:00]  I'm just sitting there staring at Jimmy like, wow, this is really fascinating.  And I would listen to Jimmy speak in public about this.  Not one phone call, but a dumb comment.  Will a tornado knock me out of the sky?  The phones are lit.  All phones.  Why do we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics.  Well, we don't.  We call it a day.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  A confederacy of dunces, as they say.  Look at this.  They're lit about me being knocked out of the sky.  Holy shit.  It doesn't make any sense.  I'm a storm chaser. 
[00:43:30]  You're safe in the skyscraper.  Just stay away from the windows.  Well, then how would I film a tornado coming out in my building?  I can't.  I gotta get a tripod.  Chicago's in the Midwest and has never been hit.  Yeah.  Come on now.  Show me.  Just give me a link to a video where a tornado, you know, gets close to really tall buildings.  I don't think it's happened.  Fucking windows are flying out of skyscrapers.  Big giant radio antennas are flying off the roofs.  Right.  Stop it. 
[00:44:00]  Stop it.  Oh, man.  Gray wolf on there.  What?  A real gray wolf on Fox.  I'd love to pet that thing.  Oh, isn't that cute?  But it probably smells more like a wild animal than a dog.  I'd pet a wolf.  Yeah?  Did you?  Yeah, I did.  I could say this, because I don't know how legal it is, but a guy we all know very well  from the old days of radio.  Oh, Oedipus.  That's his thing.  Oedipus.  Why are you blowing up his spot?  He was nice to us.  The thing's probably dead by now.  Wolves are very, very illegal.  Are they? 
[00:44:30]  He figured out a way to get wolves, and I fucking petted a wolf.  It's crazy.  And not a hybrid.  I pet a wolf.  Yeah.  I told you the story.  I walked into Oedipus' house, and this fucking alpha male, this fucking obsessive alpha male  runs up to me and then shits right in the fucking vestibule to tell me he's the boss  of the house.  I'm the boss.  See?  What?  Oedipus did that, or the wolf?  He tends to...  Yeah.  T.L. goes, hey, Oedipus, just stop. 
[00:45:00]  Knocked out of the sky, really?  Yeah, really.  Idiot.  Whoa.  Yeah, really.  I made it fun for everyone.  Why don't you go relax?  I don't remember ever hearing that in the big city.  What?  Being knocked out of the sky?  Yeah.  I don't think anyone's been fucking sucked out of their 500-foot-tall building and thrown  into the air.  My friend was.  No, he wasn't.  No.  Fucking survived, too.  Would you stop it?  Can we get that wolf to come over here so we can pet it?  Where is it?  Fox News.  So let's go.  You have connections at Fox News. 
[00:45:30]  Get on your phone.  That's because they're all wolves over there, man!  You mean over at Foe News?  Oh, God.  Come on, man.  Pick up your phone.  Let's get some calls.  You know the amount of building clearance you need to bring an animal in here?  Dude, it's a dog.  Nobody will know.  It doesn't matter.  It's a police dog.  Well, we could go downstairs.  I am obsessed with this now.  Let's try to pet a wolf today.  How do we do this?  Go downstairs.  Let's go wait outside Fox.  They're right across the street.  Let's go.  Let's get this done.  Who do we call?  Roland's in early. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  We'll go to the sidewalk if we have to.  Really.  They say you got to take the bear first.  Jimmy will pet a wolf today.  This is Jimmy's thing.  Jimmy will pet a wolf today.  Yeah, you got to take the bear first.  Look at him with his Indiana Jones hat.  He really wants you to ask about it.  I know.  He does.  He was mentioning it the whole time he was in here.  Why are you wearing the Indiana Jones hat?  I see this shirt.  Oh.  Oh.  Riley, I like your hat.  Why are you wearing that hat, Roland?  Yeah, what's with the hat, Roland? 
[00:46:30]  Because you wouldn't.  You got a fedora on.  Very indie.  It's Indiana Jones day.  It's Indiana Jones day.  That's what I just heard.  Why is it Indiana Jones day?  Indiana Jones.  Because of the Blu-rays.  Oh.  I see it got a whip.  Oh, did we get the Blu-rays?  Yeah, I did.  What?  What is he saying?  I swear I should blow it up.  I swear I should blow it up.  Don't look into it.  I keep covering it.  Don't look into it.  I keep covering it. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, we'll see it.  Roland, we want to pet a wolf today.  We want to see how good you are.  There's a wolf on Fox News right now.  They're right across the street.  You sure?  You sure?  You sure?  You sure?  You sure?  You sure?  You sure?  You sure?  You sure?  You want them to bring in the building?  Or we'll go outside.  Yeah, we have to go outside.  Whatever.  Could you make some calls?  All right.  Jimmy wants to pet a wolf today.  You want to pet a wolf?  Roland's unhappy.  Why?  Because you gave him a task that's going to be difficult.  He took off his hat.  He's frowning.  He's not happy you asked him to do this.  Why? 
[00:47:30]  Because it's a wolf.  I'm hungry like it.  Oh, fucking take us home, fatso.  Negro, that's all you had to say.  I'm going to see if you want to pet a wolf.  You really want to pet a wolf?  I want to pet a wolf.  Yeah, book the wolf.  What's the matter with you?  Yeah, he's going to clean up a murder first.  Yes.  Can you try?  All right.  I was telling a story about the baby tigers back in the day we pet.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking tiger, man.  Fucking tiger, man. 
[00:48:00]  And then the lunatic, you weren't around for that.  They brought in baby tigers to K-Roc.  I'm talking about the N.E.W. one.  Wait, we had tigers at K-Roc too.  Oh, yeah.  Remember it bit me?  Three of them.  Scratched me.  I was bleeding.  We had a monkey too.  Oh.  Yeah, I remember the monkey.  Jesus.  I'm talking about the N.E.W. days where we had a baby tiger.  And then this lunatic, he goes, hey, man, I got a baby elephant in the fucking truck.  You want me to bring it up?  I'm like, we're not going to get a baby elephant in the elevator?  He goes, all right, I'm just asking. 
[00:48:30]  But I brought it in just in case.  You can't disguise a baby elephant or something.  Like, you could say that baby tiger is just like a cat.  K-Roc just put his shirt on there.  They're just like, hello.  You give the ID downstairs, K-Roc's ID.  Oh, hello.  It's like, oh, you're losing weight, I see.  Dieting.  You remember baby elephant guy, though? 
[00:49:00]  Show me building ID.  I don't think that's appropriate, K-Roc.  It isn't.  It's terrible.  No.  Oh.  All right, I got a guy that can bring in a wolf tomorrow.  What?  Baby wolf.  A baby wolf?  Come on, it's fucking adorable.  Does he have a bag he can sneak it past?  You can't bring one up.  If Nicole brings her stupid dog up, then we can bring a baby wolf up tomorrow.  You have to, I believe, Nicole can get it up because she's got a building pass. 
[00:49:30]  But for a guest to bring up a dog, you have to have papers that say you need it for therapeutic reasons.  All right.  So how about we have Nicole sneak the baby wolf in tomorrow?  Or Dr. Steve Wright says prescription.  For dogs.  Dr. Steve's not a dog.  I prescribe one.  Take one wolf every hour.  Okay.  I'm not a doctor.  I didn't know these things.  We know you're not a doctor, Roland.  I'm not an astronaut.  We know. 
[00:50:00]  Why are you still in here?  Go figure out the wolf thing.  Yeah, bring us a wolf.  Come on.  Bring us a wolf thing.  We want to see how good you are, Roland.  I want to frolic with hornets.  Get that done.  Oh.  Oh, he's mad.  No time for pizza, Dr. Jones.  He's mad.  He's walking down the hall with his Indiana Jones hat.  He has his Indiana Jones hat.  It looks more like the boulder that was chasing him.  Crap.  Oh, there goes the Endeavor making its journey from the Cape Canaveral to Los Angeles, where 
[00:50:30]  it will be on display in L.A. getting their own shuttle.  Is that one of the ones that was in space?  In space, yeah.  That's a big one.  You remember Space Shuttle Endeavor?  We got a space shuttle.  We got a shitty space shuttle.  We got the one that wasn't even in space.  We got a shitty one.  We got the test one.  It was still cool to see.  It didn't even have engines in it.  No, Edgar.  Stupid shuttle.  We got stupid shuttle.  Really cool to see up close, though.  But we got stupid shuttle. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  True.  Our shuttle eats asshole.  It did.  Come on.  Man, stupid shuttle.  They got cool shuttles.  Hey, man, a tornado could gut out a skyscraper.  I'm sure it could if it was at full strength and hit skyscrapers.  Thus then, I could be fucking thrown out of a building.  They never do that.  I think what happens is the structure of a city itself interferes with the weather that  makes a tornado and does not even allow a tornado to hit a city, I think. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know anything, because as Bill Barr would say, oh, no, it's, uh, Jesus, it's  Anthony Meteorologist.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm the first defense for New York City.  Yeah.  I'm not in the middle of the city.  I'm on the edge.  I would be hit first by this tornado, and I would be thrown out of the fucking building.  You know what you do, though?  I'll tell you how you cure that.  You prevent that. 
[00:52:00]  You take all your clothes off, and you drink some Jack Daniels, and then right when the  tornado's right there, you fucking curse at it and throw the bottle of Jack Daniels  into the tornado, and it takes it away.  That is what I call extreme.  And they will call you the extreme.  Yeah!  Woo!  The extreme!  Yeah!  That's the worst Van Halen song.  Oh, for the worst movie, you might as well.  What's the name of this?  Yeah!  Human being or something? 
[00:52:30]  Right?  All right!  Get in!  Why wouldn't they go and running with the devil?  Come on, man!  Maybe it was too expensive to get the rights to that one.  Probably.  Van Halen goes here.  Here's one.  Yeah, they go here.  You can have one of our shitty songs, because you're not willing to pay.  Terrible.  Listen to this piece of shit song.  Woo!  Dusty!  Where's Dusty?  Come on, Dusty!  Get in the vehicle!  Woo!  The extreme!  Although I do like Eddie's guitar in this song. 
[00:53:00]  Well, you've got to love the Eddie guitar.  Yeah!  This song stinks.  The extreme.  That's what makes us human.  It's already here!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  There it is.  They're just all driving toward the fucking bad weather.  Rocking in their vehicles. 
[00:53:30]  Hitting the steering wheel to the music.  Yeah!  Are they really?  Oh, yes.  Let me see that.  Twister.  Are they rocking for the music in the car?  They are fucking.  They're loving it.  Loving life.  They're loving that they're storm chasers, Matt.  And they're not corporate storm chasers.  They do it themselves.  They don't have sponsorship.  Yeah, why do they go with that corporate angle in a tornado?  Oh, they hate it because they don't have the bad guys.  The bad guy was the tornado and the corporate sponsored fucking tornado chaser. 
[00:54:00]  It's hard to find a bad guy when everyone's just looking at weather.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are they rocking out here?  There they go.  All right.  Is this the video?  Yeah, the official video.  This is the video.  They have clips of the movie in it.  Oh, boy.  That was Van Hagar, huh?  A little Van Hagar. 
[00:54:30]  So far, we're just walking a Van Halen video.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  This song is almost good.  It's almost good.  They got an okay hook.  The guitar works good.  Oh, there it is.  Look out.  Wakita.  It's heading right for Wakita.  With stupid fucking old woman with that stupid mobile in front of her house that inspires  them to put tin cans on the Darby probes.  I hate that movie. 
[00:55:00]  Look at them.  They're all driving.  Look out.  Storm coming.  Yeah.  Is there any clips online from the movie about the video?  Sam, you blew it.  Sam, what are you doing?  You just said get the rocking out clip from the movie.  Oh, there's the corporate sponsored Storm Chasers.  Why are you yelling?  Right.  Sam's fucking...  Sam gets really riled when we pick apart his web browsing.  Apparently, he keeps hoping that he's going to land on a magic moment in here.  It's not going to happen.  Let's find it.  So, Sam was enjoying it a minute ago, and now he's pretending not to because Jim does it.  Oh, yeah.  You're telling me what I want. 
[00:55:30]  I'm enjoying...  I'm making...  Oh!  I am taking your shit and your mistake and making it better.  So, you should thank me.  Thank you.  Wow.  Sam.  Wow.  You'll be discussing that on the after show for an hour.  Straight.  Yeah, I would put Twister Shine on.  And not Twister Van Halen.  Well, I'm also getting word that we should Google downtown Miami tornado.  Oh, yeah?  But they don't...  Oh, never mind. 
[00:56:00]  I was about to say something really stupid.  Uh-oh.  Because I've never seen the skyscrapers, because I usually go to Miami Beach.  Miami Beach.  I was going to say, they don't have skyscrapers.  Oh, shit.  See, now I said it officially.  They have elevators in England?  Right.  When Florentine got in the fucking elevator with Saxon.  Why would you go to downtown Miami when there's that Miami Beach right there?  You ever watch Cocaine Cowboys?  Sure.  No.  It's a great documentary about...  The Medellin cartel and Pablo Escobar. 
[00:56:30]  It's just how all those Miami skyscrapers are built with cocaine money.  Really?  That's great, yeah.  Probably want to put Twister movie.  It's...  And, you know, Twister movie shine on.  Because if you put Twister shine on, you're going to see, like, videos of tornadoes and  then the sun coming out.  Yeah.  It's just...  I've never seen anybody so inept at Googling.  It really...  You're a terrible Googler.  Well, I say we take a break because I want to fucking eat.  Oh, right. 
[00:57:00]  And then we've got to get into the Romney on Cavuto.  We've got to get the Obama on the Letterman.  Then we've got Obama's secret clip that was released.  That the media seems to be ignoring.  And then we've got the Clint Eastwood fucking making fun of some shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's saying people are just dumb.  Well...  Explain after the break.  I'm going to go with that.  Hit it.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:57:30]  It's this little bass run.  God, you've got to eat like an animal around you.  You've got to swallow some dumb eggs.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  You don't want to eat on the air.  People have complained.  Yeah, people don't like that.  So you've got to eat a full breakfast in like five minutes.  Part of the sleep.  All right.  Wow.  Part of any nutritious breakfast. 
[00:58:00]  Eggs.  Hamburgers.  Part of any nutritious breakfast.  Mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?  Hi, everyone.  Man, I went to a movie theater last night.  Yeah.  You know I don't like going to a movie theater.  What movie?  I wanted to see like...  It was a fucking horror movie.  And it was...  What, Jungle Fever?  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  It was a scary, scary movie.  It's in a theater and like...  What horror movie?  You ever just get fucking the shit scared out of you watching a movie?  And it was just...  Like from beginning to end, I was horrified.  And it stayed with me like the whole night.  But what movie?  It was just horrifying.  2016.  The Obama movie.  Does he get it?  It's a horror movie.  Wow.  I kind of stepped on that when I said Jungle Fever.  You did a little bit.  But I didn't mean to.  Of course, it was black people. 
[00:59:00]  Yes.  The Endeavor is taking off.  There it goes.  Yeah.  Well, a couple things going on.  I want to talk about that, but the Endeavor just took off.  Yeah.  And how sad is this?  It's the final flight of the space shuttle.  Yeah.  Like we don't have a space program.  I know we've talked about things.  Hey, look who's on the screen up.  Hi-op.  What?  It's Gary Sinise.  He was up there.  The space shuttle.  He was just talking.  They used titanium on it.  Yes.  My fat wife, the Reverend Moon. 
[00:59:30]  You recognize my fat wife.  My wife, Buddha.  Yeah, she has a clock in her stomach, Forrest.  While your wife is withering away and dying in the vine, mine has a clock in her fat stomach.  You can use my titanium legs to dig a hole and bury her like a German Shepherd, Forrest.  Tell her to stop walking in the grass barefoot.  She's killing the lawn, Forrest.  AIDS feet over there.  AIDS feet.  She's tracking in all the grasses, coughing and sneezing, Forrest.  Oh, shit.  But how did we let the space program go? 
[01:00:00]  I don't know.  They just really cut the budget on it.  They're talking about this like it's exciting.  No, it's pretty sad that it says final flight of the space shuttle.  It's sad.  There goes the endeavor.  How do we do that?  As America, how do we let the space program go?  We can't even figure that out?  Came back in a ball of fire that pretty much falls in Kazakhstan.  That's how we got to go to space now.  Yeah, the guy had a bump on his head.  He's like, what the fuck?  Fucking knock your head.  You saw that video? 
[01:00:30]  The guy's just sitting there dazed and confused like, wow, I actually survived that?  Great.  Thank you.  Did you really see the Obama movie?  Yeah.  And?  Pretty good.  You like the propaganda?  Well, you know what?  It's like any other documentary.  They all are a little skewed to the documentary maker's point of view.  But once you sort through that, you get tidbits out of it.  I mean, even Michael Moore's dumbass movies have an element of facts to them. 
[01:01:00]  There are some factual things to them.  How you put it together and the conclusion you draw from it, you could take away by yourself  or you could just grab the documentary maker's opinion.  What's the message of this movie?  The message of this movie is...  Obama's the devil?  No.  President Obama was influenced, like anyone else is influenced by people that they look  up to, family, friends, mentors, groups that you hang out with throughout your formative 
[01:01:30]  years and later, influence your point of view.  And this film points out that Obama perhaps was interviewed by his father, who he wrote  a book, Dreams from My Father, and that he was influenced by his anti-colonialism, which  was very important to Obama senior, and how he is fighting this battle for his father in dismantling 
[01:02:00]  a lot of these nations that were colonial nations, colonizing nations, and distributing that  type of wealth to the nations that were colonized.  And it's not a completely out of the realm of possibility idea, especially if you watch 
[01:02:30]  the movie and draw your own conclusions from it.  Some of the facts.  Some of the people that Obama was very close to were not very pro-American people.  And the fact that his father was very anti-colonial...  His father, by the way, Obama senior, was a real piece of shit.  Why?  Just a fucking piece of shit.  I don't know much about him.  He was married to an African woman before he married Obama's mother. 
[01:03:00]  He never divorced the woman.  He was a bigamist.  He married Obama's mother while he was still married to this African woman.  Had kids with her, had kids with the other one, left Obama and Obama's mom, go back to  Africa, had more kids, was a drunk, killed somebody in a drunk driving accident, wound up  dying in a drunk driving accident.  And just a, yeah, a real womanizer, a wife beater. 
[01:03:30]  Just not a nice man.  And Obama looked up to this guy, even though he barely knew him.  I think he met with him once his entire life and then corresponded with him for many years.  But he had this thing where a lot of absentee fathers are revered and looked up to, especially  if the mother, Obama's mother, really just talked very nicely of this man, that he was 
[01:04:00]  a hero and an amazing guy, very educated.  And Obama took this and ran with it and wanted to kind of expand on his father's dreams.  That's why it's the guy that made the documentary says it's dreams from my father, not dreams  of my father, because Obama's sort of taking on the dreams of his father.  And like I said, it's not out of the realm of possibility.  This guy's not saying that he's not, the movie isn't, hey, look at the communist or the 
[01:04:30]  Marxist or socialist Obama.  It is pointed out that these are people that he was friends with and people that he worked  with his entire career.  The influence is unmistakable of these people, heirs, the Reverend Wright, his mentor, this  guy, Frank, that his grandfather decided would make a good mentor for a young Obama, was a  complete communist, literally a communist, not even like, oh, he's a communist. 
[01:05:00]  He had a card.  He was a card carrying communist.  Just really some shady people.  It was a very good documentary on showing what people don't know, and that is what Obama,  how he was raised.  A lot of people have no idea what Obama did before he became president and before, you  know, he spent two years in professional politics, aside from being, you know, community 
[01:05:30]  organizer.  More importantly, how excited were you in the theater and did you jerk off?  Watching this.  I was just cranking it.  I got people laughing, though, because he was giving a speech about Muslims and how we're  all in this together and we need mutual respect for their religion.  And I just, as loud as I could, I went, ha!  In the theater and got some chuckles.  And then a couple of very liberal guys at the end of the movie when the lights came up 
[01:06:00]  and we're walking out, goes, well, at least you didn't put a Hitler mustache on him.  And I just went, deesh!  And I yelled it.  I went, they should have!  And everyone started laughing again.  I was just being very fun.  I was being fun guy in the theater.  Yeah.  Well, we got some Obama-Romney shit today, too.  Obama-Romney.  Which one do you want to do?  Obama on Letterman, Romney on Cavuto, the secret Obama tape from 98.  I want to hear the secret Obama tape from 98. 
[01:06:30]  And Clint Eastwood saying if anyone was dumb enough to ask him to speak at a political convention,  they get what they get.  He's just, he doesn't care.  I don't care.  They asked me to speak.  I'm sorry that I would do that.  Hey.  Yeah.  They're dumb enough to ask me.  Dumb enough to ask me.  Your mouthwash ain't making it.  Do you want to pop that puppy?  You ain't got to grease him so much. 
[01:07:00]  Well, fuck it.  Let's do Clint Eastwood first, because it's quick.  And then we'll do the Obama secret tape.  Then we'll do Obama on Letterman.  And then we'll do Romney or whatever.  We'll figure it out.  All righty.  Did you ever think, out of all the moments, at both the Democratic and the Republican  National Conventions, that your speech would still be what everyone is talking about?  I didn't think.  I don't know.  You get a lot of people bugged at you.  Well, are they bugged at you?  What kind of feedback did you get?  No, you know, people loved it or hated it.  And that's fine. 
[01:07:30]  That's what it's supposed to be.  I mean, that was a reaction.  Supposed to be.  I just was having fun.  You figure if somebody's asked you to go to a, if somebody's dumb enough to ask me to go to a  political convention and say something, they're going to have to take what they get.  Yeah.  He's trying to spin it.  Yeah.  You know, he's got a movie out.  So he's making the rounds.  And a lot of people just asking him about the convention.  And he started, so he's starting to play the exact same person now in these movies. 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  Hey, the old curmudgeon.  The lovable curmudgeon.  The get off my lawn guy.  Get off my lawn.  Hey, make my day or something.  Oh, good one, Chip.  That's a good impression, Chip.  I know.  So now here's the secret Obama tape.  The secret Obama tape.  He didn't realize he was being recorded either?  Kind of like the Romney thing?  That's the new thing to do in this political campaign.  Isn't this old, though?  Yeah, this goes back a little ways.  This is 14 years ago.  But, again, this is his ideology. 
[01:08:30]  And if you watch 2016, you'll see that.  Can someone's ideology change in 14 years?  No.  Yeah, true.  No.  I mean, look, what if any candidate, not even Romney,  any Republican candidate had a past history with someone in the KKK,  someone in a militia group, let's say,  that was known to have anti-American sentiment,  it wouldn't stop. 
[01:09:00]  It wouldn't fucking stop.  You know, let's say Romney and David Duke were very close friends  and spent time together.  Sure.  That would be coming out every day,  and the press would fucking run with it.  Hey, Trent Lott had to retire over what was a basic compliment to Strom Thurmond,  not even meant in the context they took it in.  Yeah.  But, meanwhile, Obama hung out with, I mean,  fucking Ayers was part of the Weather Underground, 
[01:09:30]  an organization that, you know,  he was directly involved with an attempt to blow up the Pentagon  and the Capitol and a police station.  And how the fuck is Obama involved with that guy?  And just the fact that he completely cut ties with all these people  right before the election shows that,  hey, I know this is detrimental to my attempt to become president.  I've got to tell these people to back off.  Reverend Wright?  God damn, America. 
[01:10:00]  Really?  And then trying to spin what he meant by that?  It's the same thing they're doing to Romney right now  about what he meant by this 47%.  And every time Romney comments on it  and tries to explain himself,  they're like, oh, well, fuck that, blah, blah, blah.  But then you get somebody like Reverend Wright  who was trying to explain what he meant by  God bless America, God damn America.  No, he meant exactly what he said.  Sure.  But, you know, you don't hear the press talking about that 
[01:10:30]  and how he married the Obamas.  He baptized the Obama children.  He spent 20 years with Barack Obama  as his spiritual counselor.  And, meanwhile, that influence means nothing.  Right.  God damn America.  A communist, a guy that was his mentor  was literally a communist,  and they would talk about this anti-colonialism  and anti-American capitalism, 
[01:11:00]  and that had no influence?  How do you think Obama is this magic man  that had all these people around him constantly  and was not influenced one iota by it,  and his policy isn't in place with that influence?  Just stop already.  But no one, no one is talking about this in the press.  No, I mean, they tried with Jeremiah Wright.  It just didn't stick.  I mean, people did talk about it, but they just...  Well, you know why?  Because magical Obama was just amazing.  Amazing guy.  What a speaker.  Oh, wait. 
[01:11:30]  Where'd he come from?  I don't know, but I'm voting for him.  Oh.  Are you going to be all right when this country re-elects him?  You know what?  He's pulling away.  I know.  He is pulling away.  50 to 45?  Absolutely pulling away,  and the odds of Romney being elected, very slim.  As I was watching that movie last night, 2016,  I had a revelation.  I had a fucking revelation.  Yeah?  I am not...  Where are you moving to?  No, I'm not moving.  I'm not one of those.  I'm not one of those guys.  And I'm fucking leaving the country.  And then they don't. 
[01:12:00]  Never do.  I was almost at peace with the thought  that Obama would be elected president,  and here's why, kids.  It's almost a cut-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face thing.  To the detriment of these United States of America,  I would almost welcome another four years of Obama  so that you can pull the I-told-you-so.  Because, based on the movie,  whatever happens in the next four years  under an Obama second term, 
[01:12:30]  I believe will be detrimental to the country.  And after it's done,  we could all look back and say,  you were all being warned.  You were all being warned  that this is what we were coming to.  And now, here it is.  And you motherfuckers voted him back in  after four years  when the warning signs were all right there.  So, and again, this will be misconstrued into,  oh, you're saying you hope he fails.  Well, I would hope his policies fail 
[01:13:00]  so the country isn't in as bad a shape  as it would be.  But, now I almost hope they don't.  I hope everything he wants, he gets.  And we get to look back and say,  I hope someone can fix this mess,  but we told you so.  Thank you.  Here's Obama from 98.  As we try to resuscitate this notion  that we're all in this thing together,  leave nobody behind,  we do have to be innovative 
[01:13:30]  in thinking how,  what are the delivery systems  that are actually effective  and meet people where they live.  And my suggestion, I guess,  would be that the trick,  and this is one of the few areas  where I think there are technical issues  that have to be dealt with  as opposed to just political issues.  I think the trick is figuring out  how do we structure government systems  that pool resources  and hence facilitate some redistribution  because I actually believe in redistribution, 
[01:14:00]  at least at a certain level  to make sure that everybody's got a shot.  There you go.  That's redistribution.  That literally is absolute socialism.  That's a word, yeah.  Yes.  And that, you can't call someone paranoid  for tying him in with socialism  when he's saying things like that.  Redistribution.  And believe me,  the government doesn't have its own money  to distribute amongst other people.  It's coming from somewhere.  And that would be tax dollars. 
[01:14:30]  That's where the revenue comes from  to redistribute.  Obama's father, Obama's senior,  he wrote that taxation up to 100%  is viable if the government  can deliver services to the people,  which would be housing, food, clothing,  transportation, 100%,  which is absolute communism.  That is the government taking the revenue 
[01:15:00]  and distributing it as they see fit  for this equality,  which, as we know from the Soviet Union,  does not work.  No.  That's much more damaging,  or it should be much more damaging  than Romney's.  And that is his father,  who, again,  this guy revered his father, Obama.  He revered his father,  and it's really amazing  that that's not addressed.  This influence that he had his entire life  was very Marxist,  at the very least socialist. 
[01:15:30]  Has MSNBC been playing this audio?  No, they are stuck on the Romney thing.  They are stuck on the Romney thing.  Well, the whole thing with the Middle East  and the embassies,  I mean, what, has that done?  Did that go away?  Because all they pounded  was Romney's response  and not the fact that  ambassadors were killed,  embassies were in flames.  It's astounding  that the mainstream media 
[01:16:00]  really is giving a boost  to the Obama campaign.  No wonder he's ahead.  Of course he's ahead.  We've got two things.  Obama responds to Mitt Romney  on Letterman,  and then we do have Romney  on Cavuto.  Thanks, Obama, too.  It was just a treat  trying to get around Manhattan yesterday.  I wouldn't think that was a treat.  Oh, I was trying to get...  I was trying to actually go  to the movie theater.  I saw the movie at 64th and 1st.  Oh, in the Big Apple.  Yes, right here in the Big Apple.  And trying to get from my apartment 
[01:16:30]  on 8th, up in the 50s,  down there,  it was...  Because that's...  They cordon off blocks,  and you try to get a cab...  You can walk, though, right?  What?  Yeah, you can walk.  You've got to kind of walk.  I know.  It's very odd.  I know what you're thinking,  but it is very odd.  And you're like...  Well, I mean,  would that be a difficulty for you?  No.  But it is weird.  Yeah.  A little strange.  Yeah, very strange.  But they would lock down  the city for Romney. 
[01:17:00]  You know that.  Not like this, they wouldn't.  For President Romney  or President-elect  or President-candidate?  President-elect, they would,  but I think Obama has more security  because he's black  and there's a racial fear  that they're afraid  that some racist will shoot.  He has the most ever, I think.  He has, yeah.  I remember the lockdowns for Bush.  It was pretty brutal.  And New York City, too.  It was pretty fucking brutal.  It was crazy.  Here's Obama  talking about Romney  on Letterman.  When I won in 2008,  47% of the American people  voted for John McCain.  They didn't vote for me. 
[01:17:30]  And what I said  on election night  was,  even though you didn't vote for me,  I hear your voices  and I'm going to work  as hard as I can  to be your president.  And one of the things  I've learned  as president  is you represent  the entire country.  And when I meet Republicans  as I'm traveling  around the country,  you know,  they are hard-working  family people 
[01:18:00]  who care deeply  about this country.  And my expectation  is that if you want  to be president,  you've got to work  for everybody,  not just for some.  It's a smart response, though.  It's a very smart response.  Romney handed them  a wonderful opportunity  to bash him.  But it's not  not working  for the 47%  that Romney  was talking about.  It's why would he campaign  to try to get 
[01:18:30]  those people  when you absolutely  know they're not  going to vote for you.  It's,  he absolutely  was talking about  the campaign,  about running  for president,  about votes,  not about if he got in,  who he would cater to  and who he wouldn't  cater to.  But,  it was put horribly.  But that probably  is indicative  of who he would  cater to.  I mean,  the truth be told,  it's probably  how he really feels.  True,  but on the other hand,  look who Obama  has proven  who he caters to  and who he does  not cater to.  I mean,  it's obvious 
[01:19:00]  when you get  a president in there  that's more left-leaning  or more right-leaning,  their agenda  as to who  their constituents are  and who they  cater to,  more or less,  is absolutely  based on that.  Part of getting  into the office,  it seems,  is like these things  flare up for all of them.  Every one of them  have missteps  and things they shouldn't,  and I think  a lot of it  is how you handle it  and I don't think,  I think Romney  comes,  like he said  a lot of things  and people are like,  ugh,  he's kind of a douche.  Yes.  But like,  the way it's viewed  is in a private moment, 
[01:19:30]  that was how  he's caught talking  to a bunch of big donors.  like,  if he had said something  like,  you know,  47% of this country  doesn't work  or it doesn't care  about tax breaks  as much,  but my job  is to get them  to work  so that the tax breaks  means something.  If he had been saying  that in private,  it probably wouldn't  have gotten much press,  but it would have been  a monumentally different  perception.  But you're also talking  about the presidency,  like,  oh,  we'll get them back to work.  Talking about,  if I was president,  here's what I would do  with that 47%.  That isn't what 
[01:20:00]  he was even discussing.  No, I know.  He's discussing votes.  And it's absolutely true  that there is a segment,  47% perhaps,  and more,  as a matter of fact,  right now,  that isn't going to vote  for Romney  no matter what the fuck  he says.  They are voting for Obama.  He's acknowledging that.  He's saying,  I can't do anything.  I don't have to deal  with 47% of these people  because they're not  going to vote for me anyway.  He's not saying  once I'm president,  I'm writing off  47% of the people. 
[01:20:30]  But the fact that he's  saying that in a private moment,  if he said that at the podium,  it would be less damaging.  But the fact that he was  overheard saying that  to a bunch of wealthy donors  in a private moment,  it just looks really bad.  But on the other hand,  you don't think Obama's actions  over four years  show more divisiveness  and more polarization  of this country  than speaking about people  that aren't going to vote for you?  I mean,  we're more divided now  as a nation  on economic lines 
[01:21:00]  and political lines  than we've ever been,  I think.  I honestly think that.  And it's directly  because of our president  right now.  It's crazy.  Economic,  I agree with you,  but people,  political,  are pretty fucking split up.  Obama kind of evokes  the dislike from the right  that Bush evoked  from the left.  And Clinton didn't seem  to take that from either side.  And Reagan a lot.  Clinton and Reagan  seemed to be able  to be respected.  Very good with the way  that they handled it.  And if you remember,  when Clinton was first elected, 
[01:21:30]  the Republicans  fucking hated him.  He had quite a hard time  getting anyone  to work with him.  His policies weren't bad.  He didn't have such a,  what people can label,  whether you want to  just call it a label  or if it's really socialism  or not,  it wasn't labeled socialist.  He tried with the health care thing  immediately when he was elected.  He saw that that was  a bad move.  And, you know,  first he pawned it off  on his wife  and then it went away.  And he was really good 
[01:22:00]  for the economy,  whether you can say  it's just cyclical  and that's what happened  during his administration,  fine,  but it's what it was.  Clinton ends up,  even though he was impeached,  perjured,  and fucked a girl  in the White House,  he still ends up  having a legacy  where he's liked,  his term as president  looks good on paper,  and people worked with him  and things kind of got done, 
[01:22:30]  you know.  Obama doesn't have that.  Reagan had that.  Again,  a lot of people thought  when the second Reagan  got into office,  we were headed  for World War III.  They didn't like him.  Democrats didn't like him.  But he wound up  being a great president  for this country  and for that time.  He was needed.  Obama,  I can't figure this out  for the fucking life of me.  I'm weird with Obama.  Like,  I don't agree with a lot  of what he does,  especially financially,  but I like him.  And I like,  I like the way he views  a lot of social issues  that I agree. 
[01:23:00]  It's like we're caught,  and this is the fucking curse  of the two-party system.  There's not a third party.  I either have to deal with  a guy whose taxes  I much more agree with  and I think are more fair  for me in my life,  who's going to cater  to these religious bags of shit  or a guy who I agree with more  on social issues  and stem cells  who's going to want  to take 80% of my money  and give it to a bunch  of lazy bags of shit.  It's like you can't fucking win.  You can't win.  Yeah,  you're right.  Yeah.  I wish these people  would call King Vape  as out of his mind.  He says,  we've got to go back 
[01:23:30]  to that tape of Obama  for Anthony.  Obama can't change ideas  in 14 years.  Romney flipped on everything  since he was governor of Mass.  Right.  Less than 10 years ago,  Obama can't change ideas  in 14 years.  Romney flipped on everything  since he was governor of Mass  less than 10 years ago.  Yeah.  Look,  I have never sat here  saying Romney.  I just wish these people  would call to kind of  debate a little bit  instead of just read their comments.  I really want to make people  fucking listen for a second.  I'm not saying Romney  is a great choice. 
[01:24:00]  I'm not even saying  he's a good choice.  He seems to be  a schlep of a guy.  He seems to,  yes,  flip-flopped on everything  just to get into office,  which, I mean,  I defy anybody  to point out  more than three presidents  that haven't done that.  Rudy did flip-flop?  Rudy.  Rudy was,  he stepped to his guns.  Rudy is not a flip-flopper.  Jimmy Carter,  not a flip-flopper.  Right,  you don't like what he did,  but yeah,  not a flip-flopper really.  But,  but a lot of people, 
[01:24:30]  like I said,  don't know what Obama  is all about.  And I think  when you look into  what he,  he is about,  I see a lot of,  a lot of things  that aren't really  American values  and America's,  the way this country  really works,  good,  bad,  or indifferent,  there is a way it works  and a way it doesn't work.  And I think he really  does have this  anti-colonialism  and anti-capitalism  that does come into play  when he makes policy.  All right,  we've got to move on  because Damien Echols 
[01:25:00]  is going to be here  and I want to get  the Romney clip on.  Romney on Cavuto  explaining himself  about his secret tape.  The governor coming to us  from Salt Lake City  right now.  Governor,  welcome.  Obviously,  you've seen the fallout,  the administration  quickly coming back  at you,  governor,  saying that you  essentially,  disdainfully,  wrote off half the nation.  How do you respond to that?  Well,  we were,  of course,  talking about  a campaign  and how he's going  to get close  to half the vote, 
[01:25:30]  I'm going to get  half the vote,  approximately,  I hope.  I want to get  50.1% or more  and frankly,  we have two very  different views  about America.  The president's view  is one of a larger  government.  There's a tape  that just came out  today where the  president sang  he likes redistribution.  I disagree.  I think a society  based upon  a government-centered  nation  where government  plays a larger  and larger role,  redistributes money,  that's the wrong  course for America.  That will not  build a strong America  or help people  out of poverty. 
[01:26:00]  I believe  the right course  for America  is one where  government steps in  to help those  that are in need.  We're a compassionate  people.  But then we let  people build  their own lives,  create enterprises.  We believe in  free people  and free enterprise,  not redistribution.  The right course  for America  is to create growth,  create wealth,  not to redistribute wealth.  I respect the fact  that he's not  backing down.  That's a smart answer.  But again,  he got political  and changed  the answer  to the question 
[01:26:30]  to whatever  statement he wanted  to make.  Yeah, but had he  said that in private,  that would have  been a great thing.  But that just  sounds like damage  control, even though  it was a smart answer.  But they all do that,  do they all do that?  Of course.  Of course.  I mean, Bill Burr  was hilarious yesterday.  We're going to get  America working!  Back to work.  Yeah, back to work.  Listen, we should  take a break  because Damien Echols  is going to be here  and we've got to  take leaks and shit.  Let's tinkle and do  a little man-to-man  comparing.  Let's do that, man.  One of the guys  from Memphis 3.  Let's do it next. 
[01:27:00]  Well, let's get  Damien in here.  We've been very  excited about this  all morning.  One of the Memphis  3, Damien Echols  promoting his new book.  Hey, Damien.  What's up, man?  Welcome to the show.  Take a seat.  We've been looking  forward to this  all morning, sir.  All morning.  Thank you.  Nice to meet you, brother.  Nice to meet you.  Thank you, Elfra.  Oh.  Good to see you 
[01:27:30]  out and about.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Is this your first  one of the day?  It is.  Yeah.  I'm getting to the point  where I'm sort of  sleepwalking through  everything.  Really?  I can't even remember  anymore what I'm doing.  How many interviews  have you done?  I mean, it's got to be  a hundred interviews  since you,  more than that even.  I can't even count  anymore.  I think originally  just the day of the book  signing, they had me  scheduled to do 14  in one day.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  That's crazy.  But I mean, even going  far back to the time  where you were in jail,  I mean, it just seems  like everybody wanted  to talk to you. 
[01:28:00]  It's, um, well, it  really, it's what got  us out of prison.  Just the fact that the  media and the people  on the street cared.  You know, I never had  any faith in the system  whatsoever.  I knew beyond a shadow  of a doubt they would  kill us.  Wow.  The only thing I didn't,  that I did have faith in,  that I never lost faith in,  was the people who  kept following the case,  who cared about it.  Noah, you have to know  also that there are  people in prison right  now that know they're  innocent and there's  really no recourse. 
[01:28:30]  How do you, why do you  think you guys really  kind of got, where  people picked up your  case and, uh, put it  in the public eye?  I think it started off  with, uh, the Paradise  Lost movies.  Um, people would see  those and identify with  them in some way.  They would think, uh,  this could have been me.  This could have happened  to me.  I could have been in  this situation.  But can I stop you  for a second?  Cause it makes a good,  but how did the, uh,  the movie even get  made?  You know, there's  probably a lot of  interesting stories with  guys in jail, but  they're never going to  get their documentary 
[01:29:00]  going back to  Anne's point.  Well, that actually  started because of the,  the initial media  reaction whenever, well,  it started off when, uh,  the head of the HBO  documentary division saw  a small article in the  New York Times about a  satanic killing in  Arkansas.  So she sent a film  crew down there  thinking it was an  open and shut case  that they're going to  get this case on film  of these guys who had  committed these murders  as an act of, as a, as  part of a satanic  principle.  Let's get the monsters  on video.  And exactly.  They thought it was  just going to be this  huge sensational thing. 
[01:29:30]  Um, and then whenever  they got down there,  they started filming  and they said, wait a  minute, that isn't  something else.  The first documentary  though, really doesn't  show you guys as, as  innocent.  So how did that kind  of get the ball rolling  where people, um, wanted  to come to your defense?  Yeah, I was up in the  air after the first one.  I didn't know how to  feel.  It didn't look like, it  was like, yeah, I mean,  these guys don't look  really guilty.  It wasn't a hundred  percent convinced though.  It wasn't like, oh my  God, what are they doing  in prison?  Yeah.  That was kind of the  whole point of it.  They didn't want it to  be biased in any direction. 
[01:30:00]  They just wanted to  capture exactly what was  happening in the courtroom.  And that's what spoke  to so many people.  The fact that they came  away not knowing whether  you're guilty or  innocent.  And that's not what the  court of law is supposed  to be.  The court of law is  supposed to be guilt,  innocent until proven  guilty.  That has to make you  like chuckle at this  point.  Yeah, exactly.  You are, when you, when  you look back on the  whole, the whole, uh,  process and who, is  there anybody you can  find that you dislike the  most out of that whole 
[01:30:30]  thing?  I mean, it, would it be  the original trial judge  or the prosecutor or, uh,  the, the appeals, uh, the  prosecutor who finally came  out at the end and, and I  guess offered the Alfred  plea, who among all those  people do you kind of  really have the most  dislike for, if anybody?  I guess if I sat around  thinking about it, it  would be all of them.  Yeah.  You know, there were so  many of them that played  a huge role in trying to  murder me.  And that's a hard thing to  get past.  That's a hard thing to get  over.  Uh, the judge, especially,  you know, even to this  day, he, even after the 
[01:31:00]  DNA evidence started  coming out, he still to  this day denies that  there is any new  evidence because it  makes him look bad  and, and to exchange  your, your own saving  face for people's lives  is amazing.  And, and this is a  person who supposedly  is in a place of, you  know, power, respect  and, uh, supposed to be  fair and equal.  Uh, just astounding.  Well, he's a politician  in society.  We're sort of fed this  belief that these people 
[01:31:30]  judges, prosecutors,  attorney generals, they  have these jobs because  they're somehow moral  people.  And in actuality, they  are politicians, the  same as senators, the  same as advancing their  careers, will do and say  anything they have to in  order to win that next  election, literally leaving  a wake of dead people  exactly, uh, to try to  get, uh, up that next  notch.  Exactly.  Disgusting.  And when you're dealing  with the local media, I  mean, you have to take  into consideration that the  media is under no  obligation to tell you the  truth.  They're a business. 
[01:32:00]  And just like any other  business, their number one  priority is to make a  profit.  So come election cycle,  these politicians are  pumping millions of  dollars into this local  media pool.  I, on the other hand, am  giving them absolutely  nothing.  So whose side are they  going to spend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That, that revenue coming  in during election years, I  mean, they're spending, like  you said, millions on  advertising.  Uh, amazing.  When you were sentenced to  death too, I was wondering  this too, like the, the  original moment they had  said, okay, this is when  we're going to give you the  lethal injection and 
[01:32:30]  obviously it passed.  What were you doing at  that moment when, when you  knew that that's what was  quote unquote supposed to  be happening in the  system's eyes?  Like, were you looking at  the clock or did you just  sleep through the night or  were you aware, like right  now I should actually not be  alive if they got their  way?  My original execution date  was May 5th of 1994.  And it was one of those  things that, um, you don't  know what to do with it.  You know, there are very few  things in life you're ever  going to have of that  magnitude.  And you just, um, it's like 
[01:33:00]  you can't get handholds in  it.  You know, you try to think  about it, but you, you  can't get your mind around  it.  The fact that at this moment  right now, these people are  supposed to be murdering me  that if not for getting the  stay of execution, these  people would be murdering me  right now.  And you feel like you, you,  you know, the worst part is  that, you know, you didn't do  it.  Yeah.  That, and I mean, that's  the everyday thing.  Every time you're beaten by  a guard, every time anything  bad is going on, it's the  fact that, you know, I was 
[01:33:30]  never supposed to be here in  the first place.  And that's almost worse than  what it is you're going  through.  Oh, man.  How, how were the guards or  the inmates?  Because, you know, I mean,  I've never spent time in  prison and what was their  reaction to you?  Cause it was such a high  profile case.  Uh, and, and who did you  find a, uh, treated you with  some respect or dignity and  who didn't?  Well, when you're on death  row, the prisoners there, um,  it's different than every  other part of the prison.  There's, there's a sort of  solidarity there just because  you have a common enemy, you  know, it's, you, you're sort 
[01:34:00]  of banded together more than  the rest of the prison just  because you're all fighting  for your lives against the  people trying to kill you.  So anytime I was in fear of  my life in prison, it was  never from a prisoner.  Every single time it was  from guards.  And they took out, uh, their,  their, uh, anger.  Uh, a lot of times it's  just because they can, you  know, when I first got  there, they, they decided  they were going to give me a,  uh, welcome to the  neighborhood party.  So they took me to the part  of the prison they call the  hole. 
[01:34:30]  It's like this really dark  part of the prison where in  the summer it can get up to  120 degrees and you're in  complete isolation and they  can do anything they want to  you.  And for the next 18 days, um,  they beat the living hell out  of me.  They used to come in at about  midnight or one o'clock in  the morning.  And they'd chain me to the  bars in the cell and beat  me with night sticks.  And they beat me so bad.  At one point I started to  piss blood.  Oh, fuck.  And the only reason they  didn't kill me was because  a deacon from the Catholic  church who used to come in 
[01:35:00]  bringing communion to the  other prisoners found out  about it.  And he went to the warden  and said, I know what you're  doing.  I know you're killing this  guy.  And if it doesn't stop, I'm  going to go public.  I'm going to tell people  about it.  And that's the only reason  they didn't kill me.  Did you have an incident  with the warden to himself?  Didn't the warden himself  participate?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  He choked me.  They took me up into the  warden's office one night.  It was the warden and two  guards.  And while the guards were  beating me, the warden was  choking me, kicking me. 
[01:35:30]  Un-fucking-believable.  It's, you know, I, that was one  of the reasons that I took  this.  People asked, did you have  any reservations about taking  this deal?  You know, the Alfred plea at  the end.  And the answer is no, because  I was dying.  You know, my health had gotten  so bad over the years.  I weigh, I've gained 60  pounds since I've been out of  prison.  Wow.  Did your relationship with the  guards ever get, get better  as the case got more  notoriety and people started  thinking, well, you know,  maybe this guy is innocent.  Did any of the guards change 
[01:36:00]  their opinion on you?  No.  They didn't care.  One way or another, it's all  the same to them.  You know, you're just  somebody else there.  What was the warden  thinking?  Was he, were you acting up  in, in prison?  No, it was just because he  saw me on TV.  The prisons, they hate  whenever any sort of media  attention is drawn to the  prison whatsoever.  And like you were just  saying, you know, people  were wanting to come in and  do interviews and stuff with  me from the very beginning  and he did not like that at  all.  He saw that as me bringing  attention onto the prison.  You know, at the, right 
[01:36:30]  before I got out the past  year before I got out, it  was the brutality had  escalated like a hundred  fold because one of the  guards at another prison  had been involved in a  beating where an inmate was  beaten so bad he lost an  eye and the media got wind  of it and wrote a few  newspaper stories and the  administration said, okay,  we got to get this guy out  of here.  So instead of firing him,  they promote him to  warden and send him to my  prison.  Oh man.  And that's the reason they  don't want, you know, the  media attention.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  You talked to, by the way,  your book where he's  promoting, uh, Damien's  putting life after death  and I, I blew, I'm almost  finished.  I got like 30 pages left.  It's fit.  You're an amazing writer  and I know that you talk  about not wanting to be a  freak show.  Like you don't want people  just looking at you like,  okay, here's the guy who  went to jail for this.  And, uh, I have to be  honest, the writing stands  up on its own.  Like it was really  interesting to read about  these, uh, experiences  before the murders before,  uh, you know, with that,  with that, uh, the  true officer driver, uh, and 
[01:37:30]  the time you spent in a  mental hospital and didn't  even know you could fight  it.  And it's kind of mixed in  with just your, your,  these things you wrote in  jail.  And I think it was, it  was fascinating.  I guess, did that keep  you sane?  It did.  Um, writing and meditation  and my wife, those were  the things that kept me  alive in there, kept me  from losing my mind.  I've loved writing ever  since I was about 12  years old.  It's like it scratches an  itch somewhere deep  inside of you that  nothing else gets to.  Um, and that was my  hope with this is that  if I thought this was,  you know, just, um, a 
[01:38:00]  car wreck that people  would want to gawk at,  then I wouldn't have  wanted to put it out.  Um, I wanted to make  sure it was something  that stood on its own  merit.  And, and my hope is  that, you know, people  will like the writing  style.  People will like the  voice enough that  they'll want to read  about something other  than the cane.  Yeah.  You guys have been  humanized though, uh, to  a point where people  will and do read it  and read about the story  and not just say, okay,  here's person A, B and C  like your people, you,  your personalities are  out there.  It's, it really isn't 
[01:38:30]  just like a freak show  because, uh, a lot of  people feel they, they  know you, they can  identify with you.  Um, so I, yeah, I don't  think you have to worry  about the, that freak  show aspect of it.  Thank you.  You mentioned your wife in  there and, uh, I saw the  Anderson Cooper interview  yesterday.  Right.  I was amazed to see your  wedding pictures from, uh,  death row.  That was so strange to me  because obviously an  extremely happy occasion,  but it's happening on  death row.  What was going through  your mind that day?  Um, just shock. 
[01:39:00]  Um, a lot of it really,  I hadn't at that point,  I hadn't had human  contact in like seven  years, something like  that.  Um, we've been married,  oh, we've been together  for about 17 years now,  but, uh, at that one,  whenever we were first  married, um, that was  the first time we'd  actually gotten in touch.  Wow.  So, you know, just that  we had, it was, it's a  weird thing to know this  person, to see this person  all the time, to have  these, you know,  conversations with this  person and this 
[01:39:30]  relationship with this  person.  And it's almost like you  forget that you haven't  even touched.  Right.  until you do touch them.  So it was a very surreal  experience.  Um, were people mad that  you were getting married  on death row?  I don't think they knew.  Uh, most people didn't  know at the time it was,  um, you know, the case  wasn't nearly as big back  then as it grew to be in  later years.  So most people didn't  pay it any attention.  But I mean the people  around death row.  Oh yeah.  The guards.  They were like, oh yeah,  they don't like that at  all.  They hate it.  Right.  I would imagine.  Yeah.  Can, and also, um,  were you ever afraid 
[01:40:00]  being married?  Cause I'm so paranoid in  relationship.  Like when I see a girl  every day, is it hard  when you're married and  you think like, you  don't know if you're  ever going to get out,  like how long is she  going to stay with me?  Are you, are you  constantly afraid if she  doesn't call on time?  Like has she met  somebody?  Is she, you know, does  that ever play in your  head when you're in,  when you're locked up?  Not in that way.  What I worried about was,  um, not that Lori would  ever leave, but that she  would become so worn down  by this situation that it  would completely steal her  life.  You know, she, uh, at one  point she had to take out  two loans just to pay off  legal fees. 
[01:40:30]  She quit her job to work  full time on this case.  She did or had a hand in  at least 85% of the work  that was done in this case.  You know, she did more  work than the attorneys  and the private investigators  combined.  So what I was scared of is  that it was just going to  wear her down, that she  was going to reach the  point where she just  couldn't do it anymore.  Can we ask Lori a  question?  Do we have a mic for her  because she's here?  I'm just curious because,  uh, you, you have been  such a big part of this.  When you first heard about 
[01:41:00]  this case, uh, what were  your, was it from  Paradise Lost the  documentary or had you  heard about it before?  It was, it was from  Paradise Lost.  And what did you think?  Well, I mean, there were  so many questions that I had  about the case and, um,  you know, just that were  brought up from the film.  And there was so, there  wasn't that much out there  at the time.  That was in 96.  So I just knew I wanted to  find out more and I knew I  wanted to help Damien.  And did people question,  cause like, you know, your  family and all these people  around you question, why are 
[01:41:30]  you communicating with this  person?  You know, my friends were, um,  all supportive.  And the only way I know how  to answer that is I just  didn't give him any room to  question me.  I just, I knew I just was  just hell bent on, uh, for  whatever reason, I just knew  this is what I wanted to do.  And, and, and, and no one,  I didn't even tell my family  that for four years because  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just wanted to be, have a  sense of be established in  what I was and understand what  I was doing before I put it 
[01:42:00]  to the, the, the interesting  part is that you really do get  a stronger relationship.  I think, and, and at least  the two of you could know  that it's not based on some  kind of superficial thing.  I mean, if anything could be  taken from that, wow, I'm sure  Damien knows that you  authentically love him, uh, to  have to go through that.  And, and again, without the  contact, without things that  people normally take as, as a  relationship, not being there, 
[01:42:30]  there has to be something  pretty strong between you two.  Well, yes.  And our relationship is based  on communication.  It had to be.  And I think, you know, so  many people forget about that  or they get busy in their  lives and they forget to even  sit down and talk, you know,  we'd sit down and talk for  three hours of at least a  week, wrote every day, talked  every day.  So not that that's everything  because there's a lot more to  relationships, but that's a  pretty strong foundation.  And just to, you know, too,  so Damien's doing book  signings.  Um, I think we're doing  that he's doing one here  Friday, uh, with, uh, Johnny 
[01:43:00]  Depp, who I know has been a  huge supporter of yours and  a friend, uh, who's actually  doing the signing with you,  which is, I'm so furious.  I'm going to be in dumb  Columbus.  Um, I can't go there and get  pictures and have fun, but,  uh, it's at the Barnes and  Noble here, um, in the city.  Um, it's in Union Square at  seven o'clock.  It's a talk and signing with  Johnny Depp.  That's a huge Barnes and  Noble, plenty of room, uh, to  spread out.  And the book is, is honestly  fantastic.  You talked about things in  jail, which I would never 
[01:43:30]  have thought of.  Like I, I'm literally almost  done.  And there's a part right where  I just read where you talk  about the mosquitoes.  Like I've never heard anybody  talk about the mosquitoes in  prison, but what are the  things?  Is that a gang?  Yes.  Bunch of guys with little  dicks.  Jimmy.  What are the things about  jail that you think that  people just don't talk about?  Well, I think that is one of  the things that most people  wouldn't think about because  whenever, you know, most  people get their information  about prison from movies and  that's, you know, that's not  going to be a very fascinating 
[01:44:00]  part of the movie to focus on  mosquitoes.  Yeah.  But I mean, you take into  things like that, like the  rats, you have a rat season  and a cricket season in prison  where in the winter, when it  gets really cold, the rats  and you're out in the middle  of nowhere, you know, in the  middle of all these fields.  So the rats all start coming  into the prison to try to get  out in the cold and try to get  away from the, um, lack of  food and everything else.  Uh, so you'll wake up at  night.  Whenever I first got there  one night, I kept hearing  this noise, like somebody  was rubbing styrofoam and I  kept thinking, what the hell  is that?  And then I rolled over and 
[01:44:30]  there was a rat looking,  you know, directly into my  face.  It was chewing on my hair  was what it was.  You can't let your blanket  touch the floor at all or  they'll climb up onto the  bed with you.  You can't leave anything to  eat laying around or  they're going to swarm in  there that.  And in the summer, for some  reason, these big black  crickets come in and the  whole floor at points, you  can't even walk without  crunching them because  they're just, you know,  covering everything.  The mosquitoes the same  way you're in the middle  of all this field.  So at night, you know, they  breed out there and at 
[01:45:00]  night, uh, that's one of  the things that will drive  you to the point of  madness.  You know, they're biting  your lips and your eyelids  and they're buzzing in your  ears while you're trying to  sleep.  And, you know, parts of the  prison can reach 120 degrees  in the summertime.  So you can't put on clothes.  You just lay there covered in  your own sweat and filth while  these things are eating you  alive.  And the whole time you're  just going, I'm not even  supposed to be here.  That's the part.  It's like these people have  no right to do this to me.  I'm not supposed to be here.  Did you go through waves of 
[01:45:30]  because I got angry watching  these documentaries, especially  as they went on and your  innocence became even more  and more apparent.  How do you deal with the  with what should be just  constant rage?  What does that flow into?  And in the beginning, it was  it got to a point in the  first two or three years  where I would wake up in the  morning furious from the  moment my eyes would open.  I was just furious and it  was making the situation even  worse.  It was eating me alive inside  and I knew I had to find some  sort of way to deal with it. 
[01:46:00]  And that's what made me turn  to meditation.  I was eventually I received  Yukai ordination in the  Rinzai Zen tradition of  Japanese Buddhism, which is  the same tradition that used  to train the samurai.  And that's what I turned to  to get control of that.  But also, there's almost no  medical care in prison.  You know, they're not going  to spend a lot of time and  money taking care of someone  they plan on killing.  So that's I had no choice  but to turn to a lot of  energy work, you know,  Qigong, Reiki, things of  that nature, just to deal 
[01:46:30]  with the pain and the  sickness and suffering and  everything else that I was  going through.  You know, if I were out and  I could have went to see a  doctor or something, I  probably never would have  devoted myself to those  things the way I did in  there.  But I didn't have a choice.  What kind of illnesses did  you have?  Oh, God, I don't even know  just because there was  nothing diagnosed.  I think I was becoming  pre-diabetic at one point  just because I was dying of  thirst all the time, having  to piss every five minutes.  I would wake up in the  middle of the night and my  kidneys would just be  hurting.  But I think that was a lot  due to the beating. 
[01:47:00]  My teeth were really bad.  I had a lot of nerve damage  from being hit in the face  so many times.  And, you know, in prison,  there are no root canals.  There are no crowns.  There are no caps.  There are none of that.  Your choices are live in pain  or let them pull your  teeth out.  Now, you took the  Alfred plea.  Obviously, it was  understandable why, because  they're going to execute you.  Is there any, like, I'm  watching the prosecutor in  the third documentary,  watching this guy fucking  stand there and go, well,  the lawsuit was definitely,  and it's not the same  prosecutor from the entire 
[01:47:30]  trial, but the guy who's  representing the state now,  I guess.  But to watch them consider a  lawsuit, like, how enraging  is it that that's a piece of  his motivation in giving you  your freedom is the fact that  he doesn't want you to be  able to sue for what they  stole from you, which is  almost 20 years of your  life.  That was also another reason  that I knew I had to take  this deal, because he admits  in West of Memphis, our  documentary, that one of his  considerations was the fact  that were we acquitted, the  three of us together  collectively could have sued  the state for about $60  million. 
[01:48:00]  I knew also they could have  me stabbed to death for $50  any day.  You know, I wasn't going to  live to see outside those  walls.  They were not going to pay  that money, whether it was,  you know, just from  degenerating health conditions  or them having me killed.  Either way, I wasn't coming  out of there alive.  Now, what would it take for  you to be able to sue them?  Now, I know you've signed it.  To me, that's like signing a  contract, like, you know, the  way Luca Brazzi got the  band leader to sign it over.  I mean, that's a gun at your  head, and it's not fair to  consider that a value or a  viable contract.  What would you need to be 
[01:48:30]  able to go and sue?  And in this case, I think  being able to sue is  completely justified.  They would have to reopen the  case, which they're not going  to do that because they  don't want to pay the  money.  How about if you were  pardoned?  Is there any way, would  that take a presidential  pardon, or is the governor  able to do anything about  that?  I don't know.  I think the governor  probably could, but at the  same time, I'm not asking  for a pardon because a  pardon means you're asking  for forgiveness for  something wrong you've  done.  I haven't done anything,  so I don't want shit from  these people as far as a  pardon is concerned. 
[01:49:00]  So you're okay with the  alpha plea?  No, but right now it's the  lesser of two evils.  I mean, we're going to  keep digging in, we're  going to keep fighting,  keep working on this case.  You know, one of the  things right now, we found  out that the FBI, the FBI  has about 200 pages of  information that no one's  ever seen before.  So we're trying to get a  hold of that, you know,  trying to invoke this FOI  act, all of that sort of  stuff to get this  information turned over  and hope that there's  something else in there  we could use.  That you have to go  through hoops to get  information on your own  life and what you've 
[01:49:30]  been through.  Well, I mean, even the  DNA testing, the state  said, okay, we'll pay  for half of the testing  if you can come up  with the other half.  Still, they haven't.  We had to raise the  entire thing.  We had to pay for all  of the DNA testing.  Which was how much?  Do you know it roughly?  I have no idea, but it  was a lot.  I remember like the  initial round of  testing, the very first  round was $200,000.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  And we didn't have  that.  The only way we even  got that was because  Henry Rollins went on  a tour just to raise 
[01:50:00]  that money to pay for  that DNA testing.  You know, if not for  the people that were  helping us out, I  would be dead right  now.  What do you think, and  it's probably hard to  speculate, but what do  you think you'd be doing  right now had you not  been through all of  this?  Had no one ever  accused you of  anything?  You're a kid, you're  growing up in a small  town pretty much.  What do you think you  would have done, where  you'd be right now?  It's impossible to say.  Yeah.  Maybe I would have  ended up stuck there, or 
[01:50:30]  I would like to think.  Have you ever thought  of what you would have  liked to have done then?  Like, what were your, what  were kind of your dreams  back then, before this  happened?  I wasn't absolutely  positive.  I loved writing, like I  said, but at the same  time, I would just have  this feeling, I would get  up in the morning and  say, there's got to be  something more to love  than this.  You know, I would look  at everyone around me  that had just been so  worn down and were  already dead inside, and  that looked like they  were, you know, somebody's  grandparents by the time  they were 30.  And I think there's 
[01:51:00]  got to be something  more to life than  this.  Yep.  Holy shit, you sure  didn't belong in the  small town USA like  that.  God damn.  There's a funny part of  the book, too, where you  say, like, one of the  things during the trial is  they took all your  writings and read them,  like these private  things that we do as  teenagers, and you said  the only thing  immortalized was my bad  taste, which made me  laugh because we've all  looked back at our  awful, melodramatic  teenagers.  You have some horrid  things.  Dude, I wrote a poem  when I was in rehab. 
[01:51:30]  Kevin Smith actually  read it on the show.  It's fucking hideous.  I mean, it really is  humiliating to have to  have that stuff read  publicly.  Especially when it's  taken out of context,  you know.  Oh, man.  I mean, just having it  read like that would be  bad enough, but when  they take it and warp it  and twist it and try to  make it look like  something else, like  you're saying something  else, it makes...  Literally, when I first  got to prison, I could  not write for at least a  couple years because it  traumatized me so much  having it done.  You know, it scars you  that it took a long  time.  And even now, it's 
[01:52:00]  still hard for me  sometimes.  Like if I walk up, say  Lori's looking at  something that I've  written on the  computer or something  and I don't know she's  doing it and I just  walk up and see it, I  immediately have this  feeling like I want to  run.  Wow.  I have to know what's  going to happen and  sort of prepare myself  for it, gear up for it.  And do you prepare her  first?  Go, look, it's just a  rough draft.  I mean, it's not  completed.  Work in progress.  Yeah, that's why you  lower their expectations  so if they don't like  it, it's not as  embarrassing.  What was the first  thing you did when you  got out of prison? 
[01:52:30]  Eight.  We went to, I was not  ready for this.  I mean, you've got to  take into consideration  the fact that I had been  in solitary confinement  for almost a decade.  Right.  And then I went from a  decade of solitary  confinement to them  saying, okay, get out.  So a party probably  wasn't the greatest  idea.  Yeah, that's like  shock.  Exactly.  But that's what we  did.  We had a rooftop  party.  We went across the  bridge over to  Memphis and, you  know, there was a  bunch of friends and  family there to 
[01:53:00]  celebrate.  So the first thing  was probably eat,  drink, and just  try to deal with it.  It was shock.  For the first two or  three months that I  was out, I was in  such a deep state of  shock and trauma that  it was, you know,  Lori would lead me  around almost like she  was leading a blind  person.  I would walk in the  doors.  I would walk into  people on the  street just because I  wasn't ready for it.  Because it's a  follow-up question.  With that said,  what do you think of  the world around you? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, that's  exactly what I was  doing.  What amazed you?  What, like,  technological  advancements?  Yeah, all that  stuff.  Well, as soon as I  got out, they  handed me an iPhone  and a computer.  Holy shit.  The computer, I  still haven't figured  out a great deal  about it.  The iPhone, I can  actually use now.  But it was, um,  there are no words  to even articulate  it.  When I went in, the  last time I'd seen a  computer was 1986.  And it was basically a  giant, glorified typewriter  for really rich people.  Yeah, that's right. 
[01:54:00]  That explains that.  What are you, uh, what are  your dreams like at night?  When you sleep, do you,  do you remember them?  Are they horrifying?  Or are you just not a victim  of what you went through  when you dream?  I don't dream a great deal  at night.  Um, whenever I do, the  ones I remember are  usually the bad ones.  Yeah.  Um, whenever I first got  out, the first few months  I would wake up in the  night screaming a lot.  Wow.  Um, it was, you know,  scaring the hell out of 
[01:54:30]  Lori.  You know, she wakes up in  the middle of the night  with some guy in the room  screaming.  So, um, that was kind of  hard to deal with.  What about when you first  went in?  Like, well, like, would  you remember dreaming then  and were you out and kind  of free?  Yes.  And that was the wire.  Oh, then you wake up  because a lot of times  we've talked about having  dreams of you're in trouble.  Right.  Like I've had dreams where  I'm in trouble.  I'm in jail or you're in a  horrible situation.  You wake up and you're  like, Oh my God, thank God.  I just, I just got out of  trouble in, in the blink of 
[01:55:00]  an eye.  And you, on the other hand,  it would be horrifying to be  free going about your life  and then wake up and  realize you're a caged  animal.  Yeah.  Oh God.  And you, I mean, you never  see an end to it.  It just, no light.  It got to the point by the  end where I couldn't even  remember what it was like  to be out anymore.  You know, I spent half my  life and I was 18 when I  went in, it's been 18 years  in and I got to the point  where I could remember, you  know, for example, that  pizza at one time been my  favorite food, but I 
[01:55:30]  couldn't remember what it  tasted like anymore.  And that's when you start to  get really scared because you  can't envision or picture  anything outside this  concrete box for the next  thousand years.  And you're a very well  spoken guy and a very  lucid and good writer.  But when you were 18 and  all of a sudden you're on  the stand fighting for your  life, is there anything  when you look back on it  that you're like, I wish I  would have answered this  differently or said that  differently or had in those  moments, like knowing that 
[01:56:00]  you actually were going to  be convicted and that it  could, is there anything  that you wish you would  have done differently or,  you know, again, as  anything old, it's kind of  hard to.  I could probably pick it  apart and do that.  But at the same time, I  mean, the overall answer  would have to be no, just  because I know it didn't  matter what I said.  It didn't matter what I  did.  They had their minds made  up before we ever walked  in that courtroom.  They were the Satan  worshiping murderer.  That's whatever they had to  do to put you in that  mold.  That's what they were going  to do.  As a kid, did you believe in 
[01:56:30]  the system before you went  through all this?  I didn't think a great deal  about it.  I guess, you know, most of  my education came the way  most people do through  watching TV shows.  So you think the cops are  the good guys.  And if there is a bad one,  he's like the rogue, you  know, the bad apple in the  bunch.  Whenever you actually go in,  you realize that the good  one is actually the very  rare thing, or at least in  Arkansas it was.  At the time we were  arrested, the West Memphis  Police Department, the whole  police department was under  investigation from the FBI.  Did you have a rock-solid 
[01:57:00]  alibi that was just  discredited by these people?  Yeah, they didn't care.  Right.  You know, for example,  your family comes up and  says, well, he was here  at this time.  And they'll say, well,  this is his family.  They're going to lie for  him.  And the jury says, oh,  that's right.  And that's it.  That's the end of your  alibi.  What do you think of Jesse  and what he said at the  time?  You know, Jesse was a  mentally handicapped kid.  He had an IQ of 72, I  think they said at the  time we were arrested.  Like he rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He operated somewhere 
[01:57:30]  between the level of like  an eight to 10 year old  child.  And he obviously confessed.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And, you know, that was  one of the things that  it's just to that  frustrate the hell out of  you.  Like, oh, my God, what  are you doing?  In a way.  Yeah.  But in a way also, I  mean, I knew what they  did to me the way they  treated me.  Right.  You know, by the time it  was over, I wanted to say  whatever they wanted me to  say just so they would  stop.  So, you know, I can't even  imagine somebody with an IQ of  72 going through  that.  It is amazing because you  never can imagine yourself 
[01:58:00]  put in a situation where you  would agree to something  that didn't happen.  And to put yourself at such  peril because of that.  But when they wear you down  like that, I guess you  you're only human.  It really is possible to  reach a point where you'll  just say whatever they want.  I mean, look how we  finally got out.  Yeah.  We signed a paper.  Basically, it was really  it's a guilty plea.  It all comes down to.  I mean, it's a special kind  of guilty plea where you  still get to maintain your  innocence.  In effect, it's a way so that 
[01:58:30]  you can't sue them.  But in the end, it's still  the same thing that Jesse  Miskelly did.  It's saying, OK, I'll say I  did whatever you want me to  say.  If you'll just stop.  Did you ever there was one  part to where there was a  girlfriend you had run away  with and were first arrested  for and sent to a mental  hospital because her parents  hated you because you were  this is before the murders.  And then you said, I guess  that there have what had  have you ever seen her again?  Because you said the last  time you touched her was a  kiss in the police car. 
[01:59:00]  That was just such a final  moment.  That was it.  The only time I ever saw  her after that.  What I heard was that her  parents sent her to some  sort of D program.  I mean, they were hardcore  fundamentalist, you know,  backwoods Christians, you  know, just like a step above  the snake handling poison  drinking guys.  So whenever they found out  that we had been having sex  to them, that was like the  ultimate evil.  So they sent her to some  sort of deprogramming center  to get her back on the  straight and narrow.  The only time I ever saw 
[01:59:30]  her again after that was  whenever she was on the  stand during the trial.  That was it.  Oh, she testified.  I didn't know that.  Was it was it was it  positive for you or was it  negative or was it neither?  Neither one really.  They just brought her on the  stand to say she they  asked her, did I have a  knife?  And she said, yes.  Thank you.  Yeah.  And I know you don't know.  No one has any answers on  it, really.  But in your in purely an  opinion, do you think do you  think that Terry Hobbs had  something to do with it?  I mean, I know it's hard to  accuse someone because of all  the stuff with you and Mark 
[02:00:00]  Byers that went back and  forth.  But it just it doesn't look  good after that third  documentary.  It doesn't.  And people say, you know,  well, you want to be careful  of doing the same thing to  him that was done to you.  But at the same time, our  entire case against him.  Basically, if you when you  see the movie West of  Memphis, this is pretty much  the case we would have put  on if there would have been  a hearing, if there would  have been a trial.  So everything that we point  towards him is all physical 
[02:00:30]  evidence.  You know, it's all either DNA  or it's eyewitnesses, you  know, things of that nature.  It's not hearsay.  It's not ghost stories.  It's not the fact that he read  Stephen King novels.  Right.  You know, he says, for  example, that he never even  saw the victims the day they  were murdered.  Right.  Three witnesses have come  forward and said they saw him  with the victims within an hour  of the time they were  murdered.  We did a lot of other stuff  that didn't make it into the  film also just because there  was nothing we could do with  it.  Like, for example, we found  the truck he had at the time 
[02:01:00]  of the murders and Luminol  tested it and there was blood  in the truck, but it was so  old and degraded.  It couldn't be identified.  Same thing in his kitchen.  We went into the house.  Luminol tested.  There was blood under the  linoleum in the kitchen, but  it was so old and degraded that,  you know, it couldn't be  identified.  DNA couldn't do anything with  it.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Wow.  And you had a there's also  something where are you and  Jason speaking again?  I know that afterwards you  guys had a falling out of  over.  Well, technically, it wasn't  between Jason and I. 
[02:01:30]  It was between me and the  people making this movie.  At one point, you know, I  had read the movie script and  it was absolutely horrendous.  I think it was written by the  same people who were like  Hellraiser six.  So I started reading this  thing and it was horrible.  And when I started speaking out  against it, I started getting  phone calls.  They're leaving messages on my  phone saying if you're  interfering with our movie,  we're going to sue you  because you're interfering  with our right to make a  living and all this kind of  stuff.  So I was put in a position 
[02:02:00]  where I couldn't even defend  myself.  I was not supposed to talk to  anyone involved with this  movie about this movie, which  included Jason because Jason  was working on it.  Oh, right.  So, you know, it wasn't  actually between Jason and I.  It was between me and the  movie makers.  And it just sort of got  shifted to make it look like  it was between Jason and I.  But, you know, finally, we just  started talking again.  And I said, you know, if you  want to try to sue me, sue me.  Yeah, that would be a little  silly.  That would look silly in court.  Crazy.  I mean, one victim basically  suing another.  Yeah.  Just terrible. 
[02:02:30]  It seems and rightly so that  you've been all consumed with  this throughout the time where  you were in prison and getting  out and afterwards.  But what do you guys do for  fun?  What like to get away from this  completely?  What do you two like to do  just to have a good time?  I spent a lot of time at the  tattoo parlor.  Yeah.  For me, that's it's really, you  know, it may be physically  painful, but it's for some  reason, it's really  psychologically and emotionally 
[02:03:00]  soothing.  And also, that's where most of  my friends are.  You know, the only friends that  I've been making since I got out  of prison.  So I spend a lot of time there.  We watch movies together.  Yeah.  We go see movies.  What type of movies you like?  The only thing I'll if it  doesn't have a monster in it, I  don't watch it.  Oh, it's a horrible thing.  Every now and then, she's  actually banned me from seeing  her movies like she likes to  see French movies and things  and she says, I ruin it. 
[02:03:30]  Why?  Do you just the whole time?  You know, toss and turn and it  gets to the point where the  chair feels like it's made out  of needles.  You know, Jesus Christ, it  feels like this movie's been on  for six hours.  When is this going to end?  And you know, it's bad when he  goes, this is the worst thing  I've ever had in my life.  Well, again, plug the book.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's an unbelievably well-written  book.  And it's not just rehash facts of  the case.  The case is talked about, but it's  not just paradise loss in print. 
[02:04:00]  I mean, it's a totally different  things about Damien's experiences  in prison and before.  And I knew almost none of this  and I had seen all three  documentaries and it's called  Life After Death and it's on  sale now.  It's a great fucking book.  It's really, really brilliantly  written.  And you can go to Damien  Nichols dot com to get any type  of signing info.  But if you're in New York this  Friday, he's doing a signing  with Johnny Depp, who really was  a supporter for a long time.  And I love the fact that he's  showing up at seven o'clock 
[02:04:30]  Barnes and Noble Union Square.  And you can there's a talk and  then there's going to be a  signing and you're doing them  with Dave Navarro, Henry  Rollins.  There's too many to list.  But wherever you live, if  you're listening right now,  we're heard all over the  country, you probably can go to  a signing and and hear Damien  and talk and get a book signed  because it's, you know, it's a  great read, Ben.  Amazing.  What an amazing story.  It's almost it's almost like if  it was a movie, you wouldn't  believe it.  It's too it's too crazy to 
[02:05:00]  believe that that could happen  to a person.  Dude, you make you make people  question everything.  Like you said, the cops are the  good guys and all of these  things that you're kind of born  and raised to believe.  And it's like it's just like all  that is shattered reading this.  Yeah.  Well, it was shattered for me  living through it.  You know, that's there's so many  aspects of it that are hard to get  your mind around whenever you're  going through it.  And it just it psychologically  destroys you.  It destroys the foundation of  everything you think you know  about life.  not just your personal life and 
[02:05:30]  what it does to you directly, the  physical abuse and mental abuse  and whatnot.  But yeah, it's a fracturing of  everything that's supposed to be  right.  The whole construct of the system  just means shit.  It makes you realize people are  crazy.  Yeah.  Do you hate when people try to  relate to you and have no  experience like it?  Like, dude, I was waiting for a  bus one time.  I actually had someone tell me  sometimes like they wondered who 
[02:06:00]  had it worse because, yeah, I'm in  prison, but at the same time, I  don't have to worry about things  like buying cat food.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I'd hate to have to go out and buy  cat food.  That's a real lemons to lemonade  attitude.  But glass is half full.  Well, they're saying Damien has to  go because you have a lot of press.  Very cool.  This was amazing, Damien.  Thank you guys.  It was a pleasure meeting you, sir.  Ever since I saw the first  documentary, I thought the story  was fascinating.  You really came off, even at that 
[02:06:30]  time, like a very smart guy and  like, what the fuck is he doing in  this situation?  To see you pop out on the other  end of this with any, any bit of  sanity is amazing.  So just amazing to have you here.  Thank you so much.  Life After Death.  I'm sorry, man.  Life After Death.  It's in bookstores now.  You can get it online.  You can order it.  It's a fucking great, great book.  Very cool.  Damien Echols, everyone.  Thank you.  Oh, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[02:07:00]  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  That was one for the ages.  That was an amazing.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Amazing interview.  Holy fuck.  He was great.  Wow.  Goddamn.  I think we asked everything we could.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could just keep going and going.  Like, like, just getting more into the case and the murders and stuff. 
[02:07:30]  Like, you just want to keep asking him shit about the case.  But the one thing that got me, and it's a simple thing.  Yeah.  The mosquitoes.  Yeah.  It's a simple thing, I know, but the mosquitoes, and having no defense against that whatsoever.  Because it's so fucking hot, you've got to take most of your clothes off, and then you've got mosquitoes biting the shit out of you.  You know what, I can relate, my backyard, especially with the pool heater on.  And no tiki torches.  And the tiki torches, when they get a little low on fluid, and I can't light them all, I can relate, absolutely. 
[02:08:00]  Yes.  And I told Damien a thing or two, I said, this is our prison, sir.  Yes.  This is our prison.  For hours every day, we have to sit here and toil.  We can relate, sir.  Exactly.  Getting beaten, but it's a browbeaten by a manager.  He's doing a documentary, he'll come back in December, too.  That'd be great, yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Great guest.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I don't know how people, like, I would love to know what he's turned up, what they've turned up about the other stepfather, too.  Apparently that will be in the documentary.  I can't wait to see that, yeah. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  It seems like they really kind of went forward to check this guy out.  I mean, if they're spraying lumen all around, I'm sure they, you know, they really want to kind of look into this guy.  They want this guy.  Oh, good.  I was just going to say, does blood get to a point where the DNA can't?  I guess, yeah, don't forget, like, so many fucking years ago, it's, you know, 18 years ago.  Talking about 18 plus years.  Yeah, and it might not even have been the kid's blood.  It could have been a deer in the truck or a fucking dog.  Sure, sure. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, even the children with dears.  Yeah, they would, but they spell that differently.  I was thinking D-W-E-R and you're thinking D-A-R.  Oh, I get it.  But, um, someday DNA will be able to do that, but I think right now the testing's just not advanced enough.  Right.  We'll get to that point.  I really hope that they make such a strong case.  I hope that they push these fucking shitheads in Arkansas to have to reopen the case.  Right.  Yeah.  The other thing that was fascinating, solitary confinement, rooftop party.  What the fuck? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going from hell to holy shit, let's have some fun.  Dude, I went to Amy's rooftop party.  I didn't know how to act.  And, you know, he's appreciative, but he, you know, in hindsight, he's thinking, well, maybe that wasn't the best thing to do.  He probably got loaded, though.  Yeah.  How you go through that, though, and don't just fucking lose your mind, be hateful and enraged every day.  I mean, I am, and I didn't go through that.  Yeah.  And I'm fucking hateful and enraged every day. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, you're angry at the idea that a man may want to tax more of your $30 million.  Oh, or certain couples are dating.  Jesus.  Oh, I'm so intolerant.  Yes, you really are.  I am.  But the word you're looking for is an asshole.  But, yeah, man, to be able to be like he is, it's amazing to me that he can actually.  To get into all that Zen stuff and that fucking Buddhism and stuff.  Like, like, is that the only recourse to keep you from just choking people? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  You can ask me.  I'm right here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meditation's great.  Holy fuck.  That's an amazing fucking thing.  Man, I liked Kenny's response.  Kenny's such a douche.  What did you say, Kenny?  Why?  Kenny, because it's Kenny.  I know.  Well, you guys were nice enough to ask me my opinion about the interview.  Yeah.  I just didn't like all his whining about the beatings and blaming the guards.  See, see, Kenny, you, you walked away from that interview with a complete misunderstanding 
[02:11:00]  of the whole thing.  You, you, you have problems.  You're an ass.  He's the only guy that ever pissed blood.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  Kenny probably seen quite a few of those in the back of his own car.  Yeah, of course he has.  Oh, a couple little bugs and rats.  Big deal.  Come on.  All right, you.  So look who we have to sit with.  I have a thumb towards Kenny.  Yeah, some people, not quite as sympathetic. 
[02:11:30]  Some people still think he did it, but it's amazing to me that people can think that with  the evidence.  I can't believe that people would have read the book, seen all three documentaries, and  really paid attention, and still think that he's responsible in any way for that.  Oh, there's a lot of innocent people in prison.  Come on.  And Kenny put him there.  Yes, he certainly did.  You'll fit the profile.  Yeah.  Come here.  But, yeah, it's depressing, man. 
[02:12:00]  Imagine having an alibi, because you're raised to think, if you have an alibi, that's your  get out of jail free right there.  It's like, yeah, I have proof that I was nowhere near where and when this happened, and then  to have that just discounted like that.  I can so relate, man.  I was 14 and eating dinner with my parents, and the cops come to the door and yank me out  of this nice home environment because they thought I broke into a school, man.  Really?  Yeah.  And the only way I got out of it was they were looking for a guy that was much taller 
[02:12:30]  than me.  Oh, he looked a lot taller on the radio.  He sounded a little taller on the radio.  So we could all relate.  Yeah.  They could have railroaded me for that breaking in of the school.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, it's hard to be for the death penalty, though.  But they had the janitor on the other side of that glass, and he's looking at me going,  holy, this is a twerp.  We're looking for a much taller guy.  What if I was the same height as that guy?  No, you'd have been fucked.  I would have been fucked, right?  Man.  Got in a citation.  I love how we all try to relate in our own special way.  There is no relating to that. 
[02:13:00]  It's an incomprehensible place.  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  It really is.  That's amazing.  And the rats coming in?  Holy fuck.  Fucking rat.  Holy fuck.  Rats.  Just, uh...  I would have complained to the warden.  I would have, too.  I would have been, sir, I got rats in my cell.  What are you going to do about this?  Oh, beat me?  All right.  Great.  Maybe I won't complain next time.  I thought we had a special guest today.  Where the fuck is she? 
[02:13:30]  What happened?  She's refusing to come on the air.  Why?  She called an hour ago.  Right.  And then we got her information.  We called her during the break.  And she said, no, no, I can't go on the air.  And hung up.  And now she won't pick up the phone.  What?  She wanted to be on the air an hour ago.  She's an idiot.  We're getting an update from Lady Di.  We tracked down one half of the retarded...  How are ya?  Laverne and Shirley.  We'll get her.  Hey, how are ya?  Marion called yesterday, but we were in the middle of some shit. 
[02:14:00]  Marion called yesterday.  She also called before the show was even on the air.  Who?  Lady Di?  No, Marion.  Right.  And asked, can I just talk to them now?  It was 545.  Well, that's Marion.  I said, they're not on the air yet.  That's Marion.  And she goes, well, I have to work at 630.  Well, I bet you that Di is blind with drink.  How's she sound?  She was coherent.  Oh, all right.  Apparently, she's living with a guy.  Oh, that's healthy.  And she has not found a job since.  Did she get her son back?  Remember that whole story?  Oh, God.  I wonder if she's still like...  Oh, I'll get him back. 
[02:14:30]  Like, everything's fine.  They yanked the kid right out of her house in front of her.  Yeah.  She was in denial about that.  So she's not going to come on the show?  She's not picking up.  She said, I can't go on the air.  Where is that bitch?  And then hung up on her.  That means she's still into some shady shit.  You think?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Of course.  It's Esther.  Of course.  Where is that fat piggy lady?  I want that fat piggy lady on the phone.  Jerry Lawler out of the hospital. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my God.  So he'll be back behind the broadcast table soon enough, huh?  Oh, well.  Well, he's back in Memphis.  Yeah.  Took the private jet from Montreal to Memphis on Monday afternoon.  And he is booked for a special interview on Monday Night Raw next coming Monday.  Vince McMahon.  What do you mean, oh, that Vince McMahon?  A special interview?  Yeah.  You know Vince set that up.  This whole thing was a work.  If you want to come back to work, you give the bloody details on Raw. 
[02:15:30]  Maybe he doesn't want to talk about his near-death experience.  You're going to get on and spill your guts.  You can get the Long Live the King.  Let me know what's good for you.  The t-shirt's available.  Are you kidding?  What, the I Had a Heart Attack t-shirt?  There's a Long Live the King t-shirt.  Yeah, they're supporting Jerry Lawler.  Oh, my God.  Where are all proceeds going?  As 90% goes to Vince and maybe 10% to Lawler. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, please.  Come on, now.  He'll be back on Raw on Monday.  He won't be on the commentary booth.  Michael Cole.  You know Mike doesn't want to do that.  He doesn't want to be part of that, but Vince tells him what to do.  Yeah.  I know you're buddy-buddies with these guys, but you've got to think.  What buddies?  Uh-huh.  Vince has a lot of influence on what those guys do.  Well, of course, he's the boss, but Michael Cole also has a history in actual news, so he may...  Well, wouldn't they want to just have that conversation privately?  Well, maybe it's a different one. 
[02:16:30]  Not in front of millions of people because Vince realizes, I could get ratings from this.  There's a private conversation.  There's a public conversation.  And the WWE universe would love an update, you know?  Well, he's doing fine.  There's your update.  Long live the king.  Yeah, we like the king.  Yeah.  You think he'll go back in the ring?  Yeah, I do.  Unfortunately, you do, right?  Actually, I think he...  Not by his choice.  Once again, by Vince's choice.  Not by Vince's choice.  You'll get in the ring because we have a feeling you could die at any moment.  That would be great. 
[02:17:00]  Leading up to the hell in the cell paper.  No, I think he will get back in the ring because it's what he loves to do.  At 62 with one heart attack under his belt.  That's good.  He loves wrestling.  Get back in the ring.  It's like you guys in radio.  It's your passion.  Oh.  What?  Your passion, remember?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember that?  So that's good.  I'm very happy that the king's doing well.  You get in there for a myocardial infarction match. 
[02:17:30]  That's what we're going to do.  We're going to have a 90% clogged match.  Yeah, it's not right, but we'll do it.  They're going to have a defibrillator on the ladder, top of the ladder.  Oh, my God, they're shocking him.  Right.  He starts matching cardiac arrest, and he has to climb up the ladder.  And fucking defib.  Defib himself.  Nice.  And for the record.  That would be a great match to watch.  Part of the reason that he was able to recover so well is because he was able to be treated immediately 
[02:18:00]  thanks to the medical professionals on hand in the arena that night.  The big steroid guys.  The fake AMTs.  The fake AMTs actually knew what they were doing?  It was their doctor.  Here come the emergency staff.  We're all wrestlers.  They're fucking wearing white smocks, and they're on all willy-nilly.  Thank God one of those guys paid attention in school, so he knew something.  He knew something about it.  First of all, I didn't have an actual degree or nothing, those guys. 
[02:18:30]  I'm not even sure J.R. was there that night.  Oh, my God.  He is in my mind.  That's how I see it.  Oh, he was watching from home.  He's never stopped announcing.  The king is down.  Lawler's down.  Lawler's down.  Oh, my God.  He wouldn't have hit the mute switch.  He would have just announced it.  No, he'd keep announcing it.  Yes.  He was back on Monday, though, J.R.  And J.B.L. was taking the place of Jerry the King Lawler.  I think we're getting J.B.L. on, right?  Yeah, he's climbing the tallest mountains on each of the seven continents. 
[02:19:00]  Why?  To raise money for charity.  What charity?  Some children's charity in Bermuda.  Fuck them.  They live in Bermuda.  He lives in Bermuda.  How great is that for a kid growing up?  You're in Bermuda.  Who cares?  It's a nice place.  J.B.L. will be fun.  He's going to trust Jesse?  Jesse the Bermuda.  Well, yeah.  I mean, J.B.L.  He's not a fan, right?  He leans conservative.  Oh, well.  A little bit.  Quite conservative.  Quite?  Yeah.  We'll have to talk.  And he's a financial guy, too.  You could talk about your Apple stocks and whatnot. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, nice.  Mm-hmm.  Cool.  It is Wednesday, right?  Wow.  What the fuck?  This was supposed to be our Lady Di segment.  I'm fucking pissed.  Yeah.  She blew you off.  Now we have to show all our talent to get through this next 15 minutes.  She ruins the show again.  This was going to be her time.  Her time.  You know what?  We're getting very nice tweets from Damien Echols, which is nice.  Are we?  Yeah.  What is he saying?  Hold on.  Oh.  I loved, and he put capital, he loved, doing the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:20:00]  Those guys are so, so great to talk to.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  I'm still a little in shock.  Wow.  And then I wish every interview was like the Opie and Anthony interview.  It would make talking about difficult things a lot easier.  Wow.  Wow.  We should be a psychologist.  That's pretty cool.  That's actually what Paris Hilton wrote to us, remember?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  But isn't it interesting how a guy can talk that deeply about stuff, and that vapid twat 
[02:20:30]  comes on and won't talk about the fucking blowjob she gave in a movie, which made her  famous, and yet he's talking about a case where he was falsely accused of pulling a  kid's dick off, and he didn't do it.  Not only that, she didn't want to talk about Kim Kardashian.  Nothing.  She didn't want to talk about anything.  Who she used to be friends with.  Fuck that.  Bitch.  This is supposed to be the Lady Di segment.  Lady Di.  I know.  The fuck?  Where's Lady Di?  She's still not picking up.  She blew you guys off.  Keep calling her.  I want that fat piggy on the phone! 
[02:21:00]  That's old.  Slob.  Carl Urban's coming in, by the way.  Yes.  Bones from the new Star Trek.  Yeah.  Who's Carl Urban, you might say?  Yes, he's Bones in Star Trek.  He was also...  Oh, boy.  We're doing filler.  No.  Lord of the Rings?  Lord of the Rings.  He was in Lord of the Rings.  Before I knew his name, I just called him the scowling guy from Lord of the Rings.  He had the blonde hair, and he always had his eyebrows always furrowed.  Oh, that guy? 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, looking at things.  Yeah, there.  That guy in Lord of the Rings.  Holy fuck, he's pretty famous.  That's that guy.  He's coming in?  Yeah.  And he's Bones.  I looked at him.  I didn't even realize that's also Bones from Star Trek.  And what is he, Dredd now?  Judge Dredd.  He's doing Judge Dredd.  Judge Dredd.  Dredd in 3D in theaters Friday.  And the new Star Trek, of course, being filmed or edited or something.  Well, you spent a little more time with J.J. Abrams than we did.  What happened, by the way?  J.J. Abrams comes in.  He does our show.  They usher him out to do other interviews. 
[02:22:00]  And he goes on the fucking shit show.  That's why he had to leave our show to do the shit show.  Well, he had to prepare for the shit show.  It's called the after show.  Yeah, we spent it with Judah, J.J., and myself just kind of talking about film.  Did Judah know J.J.?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Judah was terrific.  They knew each other?  Yeah.  Had they worked together on anything?  They never worked together, but they had similar passions.  He could be, in the Star Trek movie, as the guy that brings the tribbles.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Judah would be a good guy, that crazy space guy that brought the tribbles.  I was listening to the Judah Friedlander interview with Sam Roberts and thinking to myself,  what a weirdo.  And I like Judah.  Sam's a weirdo.  He's just a weird dude.  He is a weird dude, but he's far.  He comes up with some strange concepts.  Yeah.  Like, what is the bumper sticker thing he was telling you about?  Well, he's running for president.  But you could put his bumper sticker over other bumper stickers?  Yeah, he said he designed his bumper sticker to put it over other presidential bumper stickers. 
[02:23:00]  But there was something else about it.  Like, it said Judah for Prez.  He's just a strange dude, man.  He is a weird guy.  And he wears the world champion hat.  He's a very funny guy.  And no one knows what that means.  I'm not saying it.  I know he's funny, though.  He's just such a weird...  He's a world champion or what?  No, he's just a world champion.  I like having him on, because I like when he floats in and out of kind of character.  Like, he starts talking like he's running for president, and he's the world champion.  And then he'll talk on some real shit that's just on his mind.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he'll be like, oh, by the way, I'm running for president.  And then he'll be like, oh, did you see wrestling this week? 
[02:23:30]  And you know.  I like him.  I love Judah.  He's a very funny dude.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, God, I fucking...  You know something?  Again, I just got to say this.  This wow day.  You know, that's the best thing about Wednesday.  It's a guy who just puts naked picture after naked picture of girls.  And they're exactly the type of girls I like.  This guy is great.  He just puts these fucking trashy white bitches.  Love them!  I've just got to say thank you.  Thank you.  Mirror pics.  Who doesn't like a good mirror pic? 
[02:24:00]  Girl's got her leg up on the sink.  She's snapping a fucking picture.  Don't you love that shit?  Sure do.  By the way, Judah's not running for president.  What?  Yeah, he is.  He's standing for president.  That's right.  Judah's standing for president.  Thus then why I say he's a weirdo.  Running for president is a cowardly act.  He's standing for president.  He's...  He's standing...  He's standing for president.  J.J. Abrams said he liked doing the show, though.  Yeah, but J.J. Abrams told us that there's going to be a whole con thing in the next Star Trek movie. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, but I talked to him...  We got that exclusive.  Yeah, but I had the...  The press hasn't picked up on it yet, though.  Yeah.  J.J. Abrams and Judah Friedlander interaction together.  That's...  I wish I was here for J.J.  You weren't here for J.J.?  I was in Irvine.  Just for J.J.  He was cool.  J.J.'s always good.  He's like the next Spielberg, and he's just hanging out with us.  That was really neat.  And with me.  Oh, fuck.  When you say us, you mean like all of us, because he did my show, too.  Well, how did it turn into your show?  That's not your show. 
[02:25:00]  Your show was on Sunday.  That's right, thank you.  That's your show.  That's true.  No, the after show's mine, too.  I created it.  It's my show.  Created.  You're like a locker room reporter after the big game.  That's right.  Right.  That's what the 10 o'clock hour is.  Management created that show.  No, I pitched it.  You're just in the locker room getting the post shit.  But I'm the host.  The post interview.  It's not your show, though.  It is my show.  I'm not believing you.  That's like saying that, I don't know, the reporter after the Yankees game is actually  playing for the Yankees.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:25:30]  It's like saying the reporter after the Yankee game is hosting the after show, because that's  what he's doing.  You're doing the post show.  After the big show.  Originally, it was a different thing, though, and then I took it over and made some changes.  Yeah, you too.  I do like that about you.  You walk all over management.  I tweaked it.  Like us.  I tweaked it a little.  I do respect that.  Yeah?  Yeah, they haven't told you no yet.  It's hilarious to me.  It's a great show.  How could they say no?  Where's Lady Di?  It's supposed to be the Lady Di segment.  It's supposed to be the Lady Di segment.  Still not picking up.  Does she know this was supposed to be her segment? 
[02:26:00]  Iraq, are you getting nervous?  Because you know what this usually leads to when we run out of material.  Yeah.  I love how Iraq has finally called us out on that.  We can't get one fatty.  We'll take another.  Yeah.  We get a little nervous in there, Iraq.  You know how this goes.  It's either you or call Sam's mom.  We're in trouble.  And praise goes to Anthony, by the way, for fitting in the Iraq low IQ joke.  Oh, my God.  Way under the radar.  Way under the radar.  No, but Damien. 
[02:26:30]  And then Damien went, yeah.  He was just in the zone.  It's Kelly.  Like that info got to prison.  Oh, yeah.  We all know.  Low IQ.  We all know Iraq has a low IQ.  Your dumbbellness is legendary in all states.  Iraq's going to shave his buzz cut and there'll be a clock there right on top of his head.  Oh, exactly.  There'll be no hands on it because he never gets to work.  It just kind of bumbles through life.  What time are you going to start doing some real work?  And he points to his head.  Zero o'clock.  It's a time to make the doughnuts clock. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, oh.  E-Rock.  That's right.  See, E-Rock?  See what happens?  Exactly.  Instead of a clock, it's a scale with a lot of numbers on it.  Oh, E-Rock.  Poor E-Rock.  To be fair, it's supposed to be the Lady Di segment.  That is true.  It really is supposed to be the Lady Di segment.  I'm very, very sure.  Do you want to call and leave her a message?  No.  No, we don't.  We want to talk to you. 
[02:27:30]  E-Rock.  Oh, I'm getting a tweet.  Yes, I am in Columbus at the Funny Bone this weekend.  Oh.  Friday, Saturday only.  The Funny Bone.  And I wasn't getting a tweet.  Oh, you weren't?  No.  It's a good way to work it in.  You just said that.  We should turn the TVs back on at least.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe we can play off the TVs.  Because this was supposed to be the Lady Di segment.  Segment.  Maybe a little dip in Apple today.  Well, they're going to take profits, obviously.  We're down $1.63 in pre-market. 
[02:28:00]  I think there'll be some profit-taking, which would be a good opportunity for me to get back in.  Because I want to get back in it.  Too many people pre-ordered their iPhones.  Yes.  In the first 24 hours.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to go to my connection at the Apple store.  My connection.  Can I go with you?  Walk in there.  If you want to come out to my neck of the woods, which they call it.  What day are you going?  The day it comes out.  Which is?  When I usually go there.  When does it come out?  Friday. 
[02:28:30]  This Friday?  Friday.  Yeah.  Friday.  Yeah.  Going out.  And getting the new, taller iPhone.  What else it does, I don't even know.  I'm just going to start sliding my phone up in my hand a little bit.  Oh, exactly.  That's funny.  That way people think.  You just hold it like this.  It's like, yeah, that's my iPhone.  They won't know.  I got the new one.  Did we play the clip of Jimmy Kimmel?  No.  I can grab that, though.  Jimmy Kimmel went on the streets of Hollywood with an iPhone 4, making believe it was an iPhone 5, 
[02:29:00]  and asked people to comment about the brand new iPhone 5, but it's an iPhone 4.  They were looking at it, and they were amazed at the new iPhone 5.  This is worth playing.  It's unavailable so far.  So in reality, what they were looking at is the current iPhone 4S that everyone has.  And, well, here's how that experiment played out.  The new iPhone 5 just came out today.  We want to know if you'll take a look at it. 
[02:29:30]  Tell us how it compares to the last iPhone.  I'd love to.  Oh, it's way better.  Yeah, it's nice.  That's definitely noticeably better.  It's a little thinner.  Looks like the screen's a little bigger.  Seems a little bit faster.  Yeah.  Faster, lighter.  Feels heavier.  Feels heavier?  I think so.  A lot lighter than the last one.  It's a lot faster as well.  What idiots.  It's going to take forever.  So this one's faster?  Yeah, definitely faster.  Right on. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, it looks very nice.  Very nice, very updated.  Oh, my God.  Feels a lot lighter and just more, um, just a lot higher quality.  And it's got, um, if you drop it, it looks like it's not going to break.  Like this one has a million times.  The screen is clear, HD.  Colors are brighter.  Oh, it has a video running back?  Mm-hmm.  Video running back?  That's cool.  Best of it have that.  So you do like it better than the last one?  Yeah, I have the 4S.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm always open for a new phone.  You think you set that up? 
[02:30:30]  I don't think so.  No, no.  Just people.  They probably interviewed 50 people.  Yeah, of course.  They have great writers on Kimmel.  Their bits are really good.  No, that's a solid bit.  I mean, embrace the new shit.  Yeah, very current.  11 million views.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Holy shit, without one kitten in it.  I wouldn't imagine that.  It would have had 111 if there was a kitten in it.  That thing's less than a week old.  11 million views.  Amazing.  That's a day.  They do great.  And Kimmel's doing something right.  Great?  Well, because their writers embrace all this weird technology and YouTube shit. 
[02:31:00]  They don't avoid it.  They embrace it.  Bunch of young kids, I guess, on the staff.  Yeah, everybody's writing about video games and whatnot.  What do I know?  How's Conan doing?  I haven't heard much.  He's on that TBS, right?  Yeah, but why isn't he...  Doing promos with the fucking...  That goddamn Big Bang Theory show.  But why isn't he...  Why doesn't he have viral videos and all that?  That's a good way to push out your brand, considering you're on a bad... 
[02:31:30]  I don't think he cares.  ...network.  He is on a horrible network.  He's buried, right?  Yeah.  You just don't hear much about him.  He's sitting on the couch with the fucking Big Bang Theory show people.  Not a fan of that show, are you?  I fucking...  I saw one episode, and the guffaws that are coming out of the non-jokes that are being  told on that show is beyond me.  What show?  Big Bang Theory.  Big Bang Theory.  And they play it fucking like 50 times in a row. 
[02:32:00]  It's...  Just put Seinfeld on for the love of Christ.  That's...  It's not good, man.  I was tweeting how I feel like when Seinfeld is over, they have an hour of Seinfeld at  11, and then at 12, Friends come on, and I'm like, that's exactly how I felt on Saturday  morning when I was a kid, and the cartoons would end, and then the local station would  put on the Bowery Boys.  I'm just like, oh, as a kid...  No, I liked the Bowery Boys, like, when I got a little older, but... 
[02:32:30]  Friends isn't as bad as some of the horse shit that they're playing nowadays.  It doesn't compare to Seinfeld.  And I'll tell you something, Friends doesn't date well.  Like, it's very 90s.  I think Lisa Cujo is still fucking hilarious.  Yeah, but...  Jennifer Aniston hasn't really aged.  It's terrible.  She's going to look at...  I hate their sensitive moments with Ross.  I just want to tell you I love...  Shut up.  Wow, you watch.  I've seen it.  Yeah, everybody has all of it. 
[02:33:00]  Sometimes I don't change a channel.  Yeah, if I'm doing something.  I'm on the computer.  I'm computing.  I'm computing.  And it's on in the background.  You know.  It's annoying.  I want to thank Lady Di for this segment.  Lady Di.  I thought this was supposed to be the Lady Di segment.  That's why we blew her off, because she's unreliable.  And we called it a Lady fuck-off end.  Whatever happened to Bobo?  That kid.  He tweets a lot.  I forgot he was alive.  I haven't blocked him yet. 
[02:33:30]  I know you guys block him, right?  I blocked three different accounts than Bobo.  Yeah, yeah.  I have not blocked the Bobes yet.  And I see his messages are always like,  Guys, could I please show on...  I miss coming in the do show.  He's dyslexic or something.  Or an idiot.  Wow.  And then here's what's going on, by the way.  There have to be probably five fake girl accounts 
[02:34:00]  that all just taunt him  and talk to him about going on a date.  They want to come to New York.  And Bobo, like, just falls for it every single time.  He is incredibly close to, if not already,  given one of those girls his password again yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  I read the Twitter exchanges between him and these fake...  They're fake girls.  I spent 20 minutes yesterday catching up 
[02:34:30]  on, like, two hours' worth of tweets that he...  Yes, yeah.  How do you think he's going to give the password out this dummy?  Because one of them wanted him to unblock her cousin.  Uh-huh.  And he couldn't do it from his phone,  so he was going to DM...  Give me the password, and I'll unblock, and then I'll...  And this is why it's so hard to feel bad for him,  because I will tell him on the phone in private conversations,  you have to stop believing these people.  Like, I'm sorry, but it's never going to be true.  One of these hot girls is never going to be the one 
[02:35:00]  that wants to date you,  and he falls for it every time.  They're not hot girls.  I actually wound up...  I actually wound up DMing one of these girls.  Oh, really?  And it was very innocent.  Like, something was said,  and I was DMing about Bobo and stuff,  and I got a DM back that said,  dude, I'm a guy.  I'm just fucking with, you know, Bobo.  And I'm like, oh, man.  Well, you know...  Part of you were hoping.  You put a hook out there. 
[02:35:30]  You put a hook out.  But, uh, no.  You know, I met one of Bobo's girlfriends.  Did you?  Do you remember the chick that came in,  and she played the Canadian girl?  Yeah.  Remember the...  Remember last minute, like,  we're like, holy fuck.  That may have been the last time he was in the studio.  Who was it?  Corey, the Australian...  Not Corey.  Who was the Australian fan?  Yes, yes.  It was Corey.  I have Corey on the phone.  Yes.  Who's that Australian kid that's a huge fan  that's turned on a bunch of people in Australia  that comes by once in a while? 
[02:36:00]  He says, drinking fosters, he has to be Corey.  There are shrimps on the barbie.  I heard them cooking.  Yes, obviously it's Corey.  Yes, he said there's a kangaroo hopping by his window.  That is one of my favorite.  It's so good.  It's right up there.  And that's how you executive produce.  I said, where are you?  He said, Sydney.  They also have a 908 area code.  Did we ever play with Faye Corey?  I know we referenced that a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, I think we did. 
[02:36:30]  We played it a couple months ago.  We did, okay.  We can play it again before.  What are...  That fan from Australia brought that girl in  and we were doing the Bobo thing  where Bobo had this girlfriend from Canada  so we told this girl on the spot,  you've got to make believe you're this girl from Canada  that's trying to go out with Bobo with this girl.  She's the one that does the podcast with Bob Kelly.  I am.  Oh, really?  Met her over the weekend.  She was great.  Again.  Like when she did the Bobo thing.  Kelly.  Kelly.  Kelly was that girl that did that whole thing for us that day.  Oh, yeah?  The Canadian girl with the Australian accent. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, exactly.  What?  But she does the You Know What Dude podcast with Bob Kelly.  You know, there is another Bobo production idea floating around  along the same line of Bobo-y and Bobo-com.  Oh, no.  What is it?  Here comes Honey Bobo, child.  Well, you've got to do that.  Oh, no.  Let's be honest.  You've got to do that.  So Bobo may be back in the studio before long.  Oh, thank God.  I suggested that we make him dress up like Toddlers and Tierra contestant 
[02:37:30]  to get back on the show.  And Honey Bobo.  Full glitz, by the way.  Honey Bobo.  Full glitz.  What has he got?  He's got to do autism.  He's got to do his wow wear.  First, he's got to do beauty.  All right.  He's got to do beauty.  Bobo's got to do beauty.  Comes out in his, it's like a big ball dress kind of a thing.  And he's got to do his beauty where he puts his arms down  and just very elegantly walk.  Then, a little freestyling with what used to be called wow wear  on the other show. 
[02:38:00]  Okay.  But Toddlers and Tierra's.  They just go, it's freestyle, you know.  And that's going to have a theme to it.  That could have a theme like 50s.  Could be Elvis.  Could be Michael Jackson.  Could be Vegas.  Could be a cowgirl.  Any kind of theme.  All that shit.  Right.  But he's going to blow this.  If he comes in and he's not prepared to do this,  then he doesn't appear.  And I want real choreography where he does the poochie face,  where he puts his fist under his chin and nods his head up and down  and purses his lips.  And then he's got to do look far away, where he puts his hand over his eyes 
[02:38:30]  and looks far away.  Can we get someone that helps him with this whole thing?  Yeah.  Sure.  Do you think his wow wear would be his leopard bikini underwear?  Leopard bikini underwear.  He's got to have a surprise, too, where he comes out and he starts doing a dance  and he rips away his little skirt and he's got, like, hot pants on.  So, wait.  What are they?  It's the wow wear?  Yeah.  Beauty.  Beauty, wow wear.  And then I guess they just do crowning.  Oh, isn't there three things they have to do? 
[02:39:00]  No.  Well, talent is kind of like the freestyle thing.  They have that.  So, talent, wow, and beauty.  No swimsuit?  No swimsuit.  Cigars and Scott's saying his talent is premature ejaculate.  That's a great talent.  He's making the pre.  If we have somebody paired up with him to help him with the show,  it should probably be whoever at the show has a performance background 
[02:39:30]  and is the most stylish guy.  Well, who could that possibly be?  Someone that goes out and performs in some way, shape, or form?  In front of a live audience.  Uh-huh.  Someone that is known for fashion.  Confident.  Confident.  Right.  Knows the vibe of a city.  But his experience has a little age under their belt.  Has a little bit of experience with that.  I always twist that screw, don't you?  All right, listen.  That's all I think.  I think it should be somebody like that. 
[02:40:00]  I agree.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Oh, hey, Bobo.  Yeah, you know what?  Take us a break.  You're right.  Oh, no.  You're right.  I saw Jimmy's face.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm going, this motherfucker, Fran Sucked Dick, I call her.  I want to take pictures with just all the guy comics.  You know, she's, like, jumping in there. 
[02:40:30]  I'm going, no, just the guys, right?  I just want the guys.  And then I'm calling her over.  And this classless piece of fucking shit that talks like a fucking truck driver is giving me the fingers.  I'm going, number one, I don't like girl comics.  I like girl comics that are fucking funny.  I can't help that this motherfucker is talentless, okay?  That is not my problem.  I just hate the ones that fucking stink at what they fucking do.  And she's fucking awful.  And I think she's a scumbag for fucking with me. 
[02:41:00]  How about you stay home and actually raise the fucking baby you have rather than trying out for a fucking Tampax commercial, you dumb fuck?  I'm telling you, honestly, I know her.  She's joking.  That's not real.  Oh, that's my mistake.  This has been Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  The O.P. Anthony Channel.  Oh, yeah.  On SiriusXM. 
[02:41:30]  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, it's me, Bobo.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Let the record show that Roland did not book the wolf today.  God damn it.  What happened to the wolf?  What happened to the wolf booking?  The wolf.  The wolf didn't want to piss off Howard Stern?  What happened to the wolf? 
[02:42:00]  Why didn't the wolf come on our show?  I don't think.  I think the wolf left.  The wolf left.  Before...  Why, the wolf was too tired from all the other interviews?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He or she did?  I'm not doing any more press for the day.  For the day for my bull.  I want to be able to do Penny Marshall.  Penny Marshall.  Fuck Penny Marshall.  Hey.  The fuck?  She's a Hollywood...  But we love your brother.  Whatever she is.  She's...  Whatever.  I think she's Hollywood royalty. 
[02:42:30]  Whatever.  So we didn't get the wolf today.  We didn't get Penny Marshall today.  But we do have Carl Urban.  Oh, yeah.  And Lady Di blew us off.  Carl Urban.  Judge Dredd 3D.  Dredd 3D is what he'll be doing.  Yeah.  We got time for one more phone call.  That was 1995 Stallone movie?  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[02:43:00]  Hello?  Who's this?  Good evening.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's me, Bobo.  How come you guys keep hanging up?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Where's our guest?  Poor Bobo.  Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom.  He's famous, this guy.  Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom.  No, Carl Urban.  I wonder what he looks like.  What does Carl Urban look like?  Does he look more like...  Not wrong.  Oh, no.  That's wrong.  More like...  Confused.  All right.  He looks more like McCoy than any other character.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Carl.  Hey, Carl.  Come on in, brother.  Take a seat.  Take a seat.  We're on the air.  We just like doing it this way.  Just roll in.  Just roll in.  Come in.  Take a seat.  Good morning.  How are you?  Good, good, good.  Great, great.  Big fan of your work, sir.  I'm not you, Jimmy.  He'll take it when he can.  I know.  That's good.  I like that.  Jimmy's a comedian, actually.  He's more than a comedian, sir.  So you are...  Actor slash.  You were raised in New Zealand. 
[02:44:00]  Are you a fan of Once Were Warriors?  Yeah.  How great is that movie?  Get in the kitchen, cook some eggs.  I heard there was a big bumper sticker there for a while, was cook the man some eggs.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was huge in our country.  Yeah, yeah.  And how do you pronounce the name of the lead in that?  Is it Temuera Morrison?  Temuera Morrison.  Because he did a movie called The Island of Dr. Moreau with Brando.  Is he in the States now, or is he still there?  I think he comes and goes.  He works between the two.  There's a few Kiwis out there doing that now.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to travel a lot for your line of work, because... 
[02:44:30]  Fucking up some A-miles.  I bet.  I can only imagine.  Yeah, yeah.  That must have been easy, though, when you were doing Peter Jackson and Lord of the Rings,  because...  Working at home.  It's like at home, right?  Yeah.  Everyone else had to be imported for that.  Well, a lot of people, anyway.  Yeah.  Boy, that was epic.  And I didn't even know...  How many people don't know that that's you?  Like, I saw, obviously, Star Trek.  Unbelievable rendition of Bones McCoy.  Thank you very much.  And then I'm like, wait, that's the guy? 
[02:45:00]  Because he's got the blonde hair and that.  Yeah.  The perma-scowl.  Always scowling in Lord of the Rings.  But I didn't know that was the same guy.  That's two epic friggin' series to be in.  I've clocked up a few franchises.  No shit, right?  And now Judge Dredd.  We've got Dredd.  Dredd's rolling out September the 21st.  Yeah.  And it's awesome.  I mean, I don't know if you've seen the buzz on this movie, but it is insane. 
[02:45:30]  I don't remember the original.  Like, I saw it years ago.  I know, but it's on Caleb.  I don't really remember the film.  That's a long...  Yeah, you're like Judge, Jury and Executioner, right?  There.  That's Judge Dredd.  Judgment time.  Yeah.  Is it the same...  Whiskey and cigarettes time.  Same script or, like, a total difference?  This is a totally new dealio.  This is a reboot, and basically the movie is about a day in the life of Dredd as he puts  his rookie Anderson through her paces to see if she's got what it takes to become a judge. 
[02:46:00]  During the course of the day, they get trapped in this mega block, and it becomes a fight  for survival.  Kickin' ass, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of action.  A lot of action, but also a lot of comedy.  There's a lot of, you know, those classic kind of dry one-liners that, you know, used  to get in movies like, you know, Terminator movies.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Do they kind of...  Do they...  Like, sometimes they do that and kind of tease the franchise when they're doing that.  Like, is that the kind of one-liners they are?  Oh, right.  They put in some inside jokes or...  Yeah, like inside jokes, making fun of the first one. 
[02:46:30]  A little homage to the first one.  No, no, no, there's none of that.  It's just purely out of...  You know, just Dredd, he's this tough, enigmatic kind of cop, and, you know, I wear the helmet  all the time.  Yeah, your eyes are covered the entire movie.  You just don't see my eyes.  That's an interesting role to have, where half your face is not even seen in the movie.  Yeah, and it was a challenge.  It was a huge challenge.  Yeah.  Yeah, obviously, you use your eyes when you're acting, to a point, so, I mean, to try to evoke 
[02:47:00]  emotion without your eyes, it's got to be a trip.  Tricky.  I would love to act like that, because my eyes wreck every scene, so I'd love to just be  able to make faces underneath.  Jimmy's all googly-eyed for everything.  I'm surprised!  I'm angry!  I'm happy!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wide eyes equals good.  That's my acting model.  And, I guess, Star Trek, did you wrap up shooting in that?  Yeah, Star Trek II, we wrapped that May.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So, how do you deal with Khan this time? 
[02:47:30]  Come on.  Come on, Jesus.  Did you have J.J. in here the other day?  Yes, we did.  Yeah, yeah, and we were quizzing him about the movie, and obviously...  He wouldn't budge on the Khan thing, so we were trying to make him say yes to any question,  and then we were going to splice it into that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a question about Khan.  We're tricky here.  We're tricky.  J.J.'s Star Trek rendition, they're amazing, and so secretive like that.  And some of the...  They didn't want to show Spock's makeup in the first one to the press, so he was whisked 
[02:48:00]  back and forth in a closed golf cart.  Yeah, we all were.  We all were.  Oh, yeah, all were.  We were on these closed golf carts, and even when we were in the golf cart, we had to actually  dress up in a big robe so...  So no one would see the uniforms.  Even we couldn't look at each other's uniforms.  It was insane.  Wow.  It really is.  Oh, can you say this?  Who's playing Khan?  Can you at least say that?  That has been the big rumor.  I think it was dispelled, though, but you never know in real life what's true or not. 
[02:48:30]  A lot of people in the press were saying, no, it's not.  A lot of the geeks saying, no, it's not.  I don't know where they get their information.  It's not time yet?  No.  Were you a Star Trek fan growing up?  Yeah, absolutely.  And now, what was your impression of...  Did you say how on bones McCoy?  You know, it was just one of those points where you just find yourself in that position where  you're working with these incredibly talented people on a movie that is based on something  that you just loved as a kid. 
[02:49:00]  And it's happened a couple of times.  It happened with Dread.  Dread, you know, I didn't read comics much when I was growing up, but I did read Dread.  So, yeah, it was...  You had to get that role as Pretty Cool in, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Did you originally go in for bones or did you go in for a couple or is that the one...  I went in for a general meeting and I thought I blew it because, you know, I had a meeting  with JJ and he goes, well, have you got any questions?  And I said, yeah, what's the story?  And he goes, I can't tell you.  I'm like, well, I guess I got no questions.  And he's, okay.  And we sat and looked at each other and said, all right, thanks. 
[02:49:30]  See you later.  And I just walked out of there and he goes, oh, no, I have blown that.  And I got a call back.  He's like, come and read for Bones.  Oh, so you met with him before you read?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, it was a whole dealio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.  And then to know once you're in, you got the franchise.  That's pretty cool.  You know, just for me, I was a fan of that growing up.  So just to have the opportunity to be a part of that legacy, to be a part of that world,  it's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  And the updated, the ship and the battle scenes and stuff were just pretty spectacular. 
[02:50:00]  It must be something to see that on the screen, knowing that you're just doing your part.  And then to add all that digital stuff in later on, it looks amazing.  Yeah, that's the thing what I really loved about what J.J.'s done is he's infused it with  a modern sensibility, you know.  I mean, he's obviously hugely inspired by Star Wars and stuff, but those battle scenes  are just epic.  Huge. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't just one ship firing on another.  It was multiple and debris all over.  It just looked fantastic.  Yeah.  What about any, did Peter Jackson give you a call for The Hobbit or anything?  I'm sure this was earlier.  No, well, I would have loved to, but I was shooting Star Trek at the time.  Oh, right.  But I'm looking forward to seeing that.  What problems to have.  I saw the trailer for it last night, and again, just to see that look that he's able to conjure  up for those giant epic scenes, just amazing. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, there's a few good films coming out, starting with Dread.  Dread, yes.  Judge, Dread.  Dread 3D.  September 21st.  Yes.  And then, well, I want to see, I also want to see the new Bond.  I think Sam Mendes is going to knock that out of the park.  Yeah.  He's an A-class director, and I think, what's the guy's name, please?  Daniel Craig.  Yeah, Daniel Craig was awesome.  Again, to step into a franchise as a new character, what he did with the first one was just amazing. 
[02:51:30]  You didn't even think about another Bond.  No.  The way they rebooted that and made it so it wasn't as corny or kind of tongue-in-cheek  as the other Bonds just made it, again, reinvent the franchise.  Well, those Bonds kind of lost their way a little bit.  They became special effects extravaganzas, and they lost touch with reality, and they  made some smart choices rebooting that.  And, again, what a great bathroom fight at the beginning of that movie.  Can't beat a good bathroom fight.  Who hasn't been in a few of those? 
[02:52:00]  Hey, when you read for Bonds, did they give you the actual script, or did he just kind  of give you dialogue that was similar, or did he actually trust you with this piece  of the script?  Oh, no, no, no.  They wrote something specifically for the screen test, and everybody who was involved  screen tested.  So damn secretive.  Yeah, that's pretty...  That's annoying sometimes.  You want to know.  When they give you the actual shooting script, it's in red.  The pages are red, so it can't be photocopied, and it's got your name all over it. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Oh, wait, you can't photocopy red?  Apparently not.  Wow.  And if you do, your name's on, so they know.  Yeah, yeah.  You're the asshole.  Who's in red with you?  We've got Olivia Thilby from Juno, phenomenal actress, and she's, I mean, you know, really,  this is, you know, her story in many ways.  She's brilliant in the movie.  And also, from Game of Thrones, we have Lena Headey.  Who does she play?  And she plays Mama.  She plays the lead villain.  Oh, the queen.  Yeah.  Oh, she's great.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:53:00]  She's incredible.  She is just, she gives a performance that is riveting, and she makes so many left field  choices.  It's scary.  And also, we have Wood Harris from The Wire.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I'm kidding.  Played Avon Barksdale.  Of course.  Yeah, Barksdale, right.  And he left after season three.  I was wondering what he was doing, because I thought he was the best pure actor in The  Wire, as many great actors as there were.  I thought he was, he had like a weird Brando quality where he would deliver lines.  He's amazing.  Yeah, he's an incredibly talented guy.  Who does he play?  Yeah.  He plays one of Mama's lead henchmen, who we capture him, and we're trying to get him 
[02:53:30]  out of the building.  And Mama sees what's going on and knows that if we get him back to the station, then he's  going to spill the beans.  So she locks the building down, and it becomes like a hunt, a massive hunt for survival.  All I would do is wire lines.  That's all I would do if I worked with him.  That's annoying.  Yeah?  You're a big wire fan.  I am, yeah.  He's one of the guys I haven't met, but I'm obsessed with Wood Harris. 
[02:54:00]  It's nice to see he's working, though, because I thought for a while he just kind of, you  know, was doing something else.  Yeah.  Tell him to go.  And I have to ask everybody from either Australia or New Zealand about the accent.  How difficult is that for you when you have to do an American accent, actually?  Yeah, you know, it's like anything.  You have to devote time and energy into getting it right.  And it's like, you know, in Dread, I did 14 weeks of gym work.  I trained for two or three weeks doing a military boot camp, learning to ride motorbikes, fire 
[02:54:30]  weapons.  And then also, you know, the accent is, you know, also, you know, you have to devote time  and energy to getting that right.  I mean, you did a good one in Star Trek.  I mean, I mean, a lot of people that watch these have no clue because it's terrible when  you hear an American try to do an English accent or an Aussie accent or New Zealand accent.  But it comes off as just very difficult to do.  But I've noticed a lot of people, English and New Zealand and Australian can really get  the hang of that American thing. 
[02:55:00]  Is there a trick to it?  Do you have to put on a certain swagger?  No, well, you know, it's just, as I said before, it's just devoting time and energy to getting  those sounds right.  And, you know, that's the gig.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes you don't know that they're even British until you hear them interview, which  was weird about Gary Oldman and a few other guys like, oh, fucking McNulty from The Wire.  Why are you talking like that?  Stop it.  Yeah, it's like, what's he fucking around?  Oh, wow, he really is.  I'm saying this one's a good actor.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. 
[02:55:30]  When you were doing Lord of the Rings, did you need a different accent for that?  Yeah, yeah, I did.  They were very, very, very specific about that as well.  A little more old-worldy?  Regional, yeah.  Regional?  Yeah, it was a British accent, but then they sort of, you know, had a slight accentuation  on the R's as well, so.  It's so odd, because as an American, you just think, it's so pompous to think like, oh, he's  just using his regular, normal accent that he has. 
[02:56:00]  You don't think, like, the Aussie has to change for an English accent.  It's just all that same thing.  Yeah.  How lame we are.  I know, but it's New Zealand.  And a lot of people do confuse the, look, you're neighbors, right?  You're neighbors.  I'm not taking offense.  New Zealand and Australia.  Canadian, Canadian, whatever.  Right, exactly.  Do you spend a lot of time home, or are you, like, living here full-time now?  No, no, I live at home.  I live in New Zealand.  You do?  Yeah, man, it's a beautiful country.  Are you friends with anybody from Once for Warriors?  Well, I'm friends with Tim. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, you know him?  Yeah.  I know Cliff Curtis as well, Uncle Bully.  Oh, boy, yeah, was he great with that fucking mustache.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, you know, we're pretty tight in the community down there.  Isn't he a big soap star over there?  Oh, didn't he do, like, a bunch of soap?  Yeah, he did.  In the book, Jake is the one who's supposed to rape his daughter, but I heard that he wouldn't  do that because he just made the character too hateable.  And that's why they brought in the guy to play Uncle Bully.  Wow, I didn't know that.  Yeah, I've heard it was Jake.  But again, I could be just fucking spouting some lie someone told me because I watched 
[02:57:00]  the movie and didn't read the book.  So my apologies if I'm wrong.  It wouldn't surprise me.  So when is Dread opening?  Friday.  Friday.  3D, huh?  3D.  September 21st.  I'm looking forward to seeing it.  Do you like watching yourself?  Like, when you go to a film?  I'll watch it once, and then that's good for me, just to know what's there.  But I'm going to watch this film a couple of times because it really does lend itself  to repeat screening.  I mean, you know, they make some films in 3D, and you're like, why?  Why did they do that?  You know, there's a cynical kind of movement, obviously, within Hollywood that, you know, 
[02:57:30]  they're going to put these movies out in 3D because it generates more money for them.  But this film we actually shot in 3D, and we used an Oscar-winning DP, Anthony Dobb-Mantle,  who shot Slumdog Millionaire.  And this film is visually incredible.  He pushes the envelope.  There are things that Anthony does in this movie that just haven't been done in 3D before.  And it's a real, he really elevates it, takes it to the next level. 
[02:58:00]  Cool.  Do you want to watch yourself alone first and then with people, or can you just sit in a  room?  Like, I always find if I'm watching anything I've ever done, I hate to watch with people  for the first time.  They do, too.  Yeah, believe me.  I know they do.  I mean, it's usually not a room full of them.  It's usually just, you know, me and one girl I'm trying to fuck.  But, I mean, but...  This is all good information.  But, I mean, as a performer, is it comfortable for you to just sit in a room with people and  just check it out for the first time?  Yeah, well, the first time I saw this was with the crowd at Comic-Con. 
[02:58:30]  I mean, I'd seen it in various incarnations over the last year.  But, and I'm glad I did, because they loved it.  They did.  They loved it.  But isn't there a fear there?  You're sitting there going, oh, God, I hope they love it.  Well...  What would you do if all of a sudden you're like, oh, boy, this one's a dud.  How do I get out of here?  They wouldn't have shown the film if it wasn't good.  Right.  You know, that shows supreme confidence by the studio in this movie.  And when the reviews coming out of Comic-Con were insane.  It was so good.  That was the platform that launched the whole thing. 
[02:59:00]  That's great.  I must say, you probably get a lot of attention at Comic-Con.  There's, I mean, Lord of the Rings and Star Trek.  Mm-hmm.  And now Dread.  Yeah.  You're like...  You're in trouble.  What do people want you to sign more?  Like, is it more...  Well, obviously, Dread just came out, though.  But is it Lord of the Rings?  It has to be Lord.  Well, it was both.  It was Lord of the Rings, Star Trek.  Yeah.  Those two are the big ones.  Yeah.  God.  Because that goddamn...  Well, Lord of the Rings also.  But that Star Trek audience is just... 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  They're rabid, those fans.  Amazing.  And it's a testament to how great J.J. is at making those films.  To take loved characters like that and just totally blow the storyline out of the water  and replace the actual characters but still have them as the same people, amazing.  No one thought that was even possible.  No.  Well, I mean, those actors who played those characters, both the actors and the characters  are iconic.  Right.  They're so iconic. 
[03:00:00]  But that's a testament to the brilliance of J.J.  He is just...  He's one of the smartest guys I know and one of the best directors I've ever worked with.  Yeah.  You know.  And you threw in some tributes to DeForest in your character.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I mean, here's the thing.  You know, being a fan of it, I felt that if I wasn't in the movie and I went to the film  and didn't see a character that was recognizable, I would have been chipped.  So, you know, it was important to pay homage.  When...  Oh, God.  What's his name?  Played Kirk. 
[03:00:30]  Mark Pine.  And Chris Pine, when he was sitting in the chair, he goes, Bounce!  Yeah, yeah.  That was such a Shatner move when he did that.  He did that really well.  Oh, I'm a huge fan.  We've had Shatner on the show here, too, and I love when he comes in because he wants to  talk about what he's doing now.  And all I do is throw the most obscure Star Trek references at him, and he just shakes  his head in disgust.  He remembers none of it.  And he remembers none of it.  Like, that's like the episode with the Gorn, when you were trying to... 
[03:01:00]  I don't know what you're talking about.  Gets very angry with me.  But, again, I'm a huge fan.  And to see those J.J. Abrams, that version, and the next one that's coming out, I'm just  very excited.  Can't wait.  Next one is going to be ballistic.  We had such a great time shooting in.  I mean, we just laugh all day.  Even with the guy that played Khan, just laughing the whole time?  Does he have a good sense of humor about it, or no?  Is Ricardo Montalbond doing a... 
[03:01:30]  Montalbond?  What is his name?  Montalbond.  Oh, that's close enough.  No, Voss.  Montalbond?  Oh, Jesus.  Did you know I made that mistake?  Ricardo Audubon.  Audubon.  Montalbond.  Audubon.  Mr. Rourke.  Yes, exactly.  Well, you know, Carl, great having you.  And Judge Dredd opening when?  Friday, yeah.  Friday, it's Friday.  Friday, it's 3-D.  Dredd in 3-D.  I think you just sold the movie for me.  I'm going.  I'm going to go check it out.  Very cool.  Because Comic-Con people are very, very critical of stuff like that.  And if they loved it, it's probably really good.  Because they're a bunch of assholes, let's be honest with each other. 
[03:02:00]  Well, they're critical.  They would hate something immediately if it's not good.  It's a piece of shit, you'd know it.  So it's obviously really good.  You know, I just think this film is like an antidote.  We've had a lot of comic book adaptations come out over the last few years that have been made for kids.  This movie is for big kids.  We aim it squarely to you guys.  Check it out.  It's worth the ride.  I'll definitely see this one.  A lot of destruction.  Well, Carl Urban, we're a pleasure.  You come back when the Star Trek movie comes out.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely, man.  And then we'll be able to talk about it.  Yeah. 
[03:02:30]  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  And I'll be like, where's Khan?  He's not even in this movie.  Because at the moment, I can't talk about it.  Rarp.  Thanks a lot, man.  Thank you very much.  I say Khan lasts 10 seconds of the movie.  Something.  No, go on.  Or he's at the very end as a preview for the next one.  That's what I mean.  Oh, maybe a preview for the next one.  I think he's at the very end.  Like, they pan by a bunch of dressing rooms and one just says Khan.  And you're like, ah.  Admiro, Kirk.  Yeah.  I think that's exactly how it's going to go down.  Yeah, where the cell phone rings.  Something right at the end.  Someone's iPhone rings.  It's just Khan on it.  Right. 
[03:03:00]  Ah, okay.  Third movie.  It's the third movie calling.  Carl, thank you.  Carl Urban.  Thank you very much.  Dread 3D in theaters Friday.  Fuck.  The O.P. Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after One Day Live, it's next.  Next.  Next.  Next.  Next. </pre>
