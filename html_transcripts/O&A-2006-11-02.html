<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a recurring humorous segment featuring the radio ID of Paul R. Nelson, whose merchandise, particularly a black security shirt, unexpectedly gained popularity, with many attendees at their Halloween party sporting them.  The hosts then transitioned into a discussion about a Brooklyn high school student who wore a Hitler costume for Halloween, sparking media attention.  They debated whether this constituted hate speech, analyzing the student’s apparent attempt at gaining internet fame, comparing it to other such instances, including a clip of their intern being hit with a kickball.  The First Amendment and the Anti-Defamation League were referenced in this discussion.

The show heavily featured Jim Norton's recent appearance on the David Letterman Show. Opie and Anthony critiqued other guests, calling Gary Sinise "awful" and Joan Rivers a "babbling ass," contrasting them with Norton's praised edgy performance, which included jokes touching on race and homophobia, prompting speculation about potential legal repercussions from CBS.  Colin Quinn was a guest in the studio during this portion of the show, and his upcoming stand-up appearances were promoted, along with the hosts' upcoming feature in FHM magazine.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on their chaotic Halloween show at the Hard Rock Cafe.  The show's primary disruption stemmed from Flavor Flav and his massive entourage (at least 40-50 people), who hijacked about 55 minutes of airtime, introducing numerous individuals instead of performing as planned. This caused significant editing challenges and frustration.  Listener complaints about the event, including "FU free FM chants" during the live broadcast, poor ticket distribution, and an alleged purse theft by someone in Flav's posse were discussed.  Listener calls recounted negative experiences, such as one listener whose girlfriend was refused a photo with Flavor Flav because she was "too white."  The hosts described the overwhelming presence of Flav and his entourage, leading to near-confrontations, including Voss almost clashing with Flav in the green room.  Opie expressed his extreme dislike for the uncontrolled environment, and the discussion extended to the changing dynamics of entourages in the entertainment industry, comparing the Beatles to modern rappers.  Danny's provocative Borat costume at the party was also mentioned, as was Borat's upcoming appearance on the show.  The hosts’ discomfort with the situation was repeatedly and strongly expressed using profanity.

The broadcast also included a segment about ESPN commentator Brian Kitchen's reprimand for saying "that's kind of gay," leading to a debate about the evolving interpretations of words like "gay" and "faggot,"  their context, and intent versus perceived hateful speech.  The hosts played audio of Kitchen's comment and discussed ESPN's response, criticizing the perceived increased sensitivity and political correctness.  They contrasted this with past acceptance of offensive language and discussed perceived double standards based on political affiliation. A caller provided a different perspective. The View's coverage of John Kerry's failed joke was also discussed, highlighting contrasting reactions and perceived political biases.  Audio clips of Kitchen's comment, portions of The View's discussion, and taser clips were played.  The hosts’ usual walk to the XM building was also documented, noting the decreased fan turnout due to cold weather; the show concluded with them searching for their FHM magazine at a newsstand.

Later in the show, Opie discussed his discomfort with Jim Norton's jokes, which led to a conversation about their elevator habits and Norton sharing gruesome elevator accident stories, much to the dismay of the new program director, John Minnelli, who was a guest in the studio. Minnelli's new jacket, purchased at James Cagney's estate sale, prompted a discussion about buying memorabilia from deceased celebrities.  The hosts, along with Roland (another guest), then extensively recounted the disastrous Flavor Flav Halloween party, expressing frustration with Flav's performance and his entourage's behavior, blaming miscommunication between Flav, his manager, and the show's staff.  Numerous listener calls further fueled the conversation.  The segment included descriptions of costumes and atmosphere, highlighting the incongruity between Flav's performance and the overall tone of the party. A clip of Anthony singing "Sweet Caroline" at the party was played.

The show also included a discussion about the size of a bowel movement, transitioning to stories about their studio-absent manager, Jonathan, described as a "psychopath" due to his recounted experiences in West Africa.  His obsession with Idi Amin and a description of his penis as a "water balloon cock" were mentioned.  The hosts discussed newly uploaded YouTube videos from their Halloween party, including clips of "Bobbing for dildos" and "Mummy Glue Trap Challenge," as well as taser audio clips. E-Rock's late arrival after editing the Halloween show was also mentioned.  A lengthy discussion about Borat's persona, including his anti-Semitic country-western song, followed, along with discussions of Tara Reid's plastic surgery, an 18-year-old girl's infected nipple piercing, and the discomfort surrounding their participation in a Hungerthon due to past rejected donations, including a recounted awkward encounter with a priest during a double dong dildo show.  Johnny Gallagher's bad impressions, the upcoming appearances of Borat, Tom Papa, and possibly Jimmy Carter, and a promotion for "Last Past Standing," a stand-up comedy show featuring Opie and Anthony fans, concluded the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  Right from the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming to your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. 
[00:00:30]  I wish to God they weren't.  It's at one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  You could have stopped this outbreak before it mutated.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out. 
[00:01:00]  Here we go.  Opie.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Excuse me while I whip this out. 
[00:01:30]  Hey, where are the white women at?  Lordy Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  And I got it from a negro.  What are you getting at?  What?  What are you getting at with your sound clip?  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Come on.  Can you say hijack? 
[00:02:00]  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It's good to be back in the studio.  Yes, it is.  It's very good to be back in the studio.  I like the safety, the sanctity of the studio.  Hey, hey, hey, what happened?  It was a bit abrupt.  What happened?  Yeah.  It just stopped on its own. 
[00:02:30]  I already fixed it, E-Rock.  Get back to your seat.  Get back to your post.  Get back to your post and do what you do.  And by that, I mean your post-raising brand that he has all the time he's eating.  Back to your post.  Ah, ah, ah.  But, but, but, man.  Yes.  Back to other safety and sanctity.  Well, we did our Halloween show.  The paleness of our studio.  Yeah, we did our Halloween show at the Hard Rock Cafe on Tuesday night. 
[00:03:00]  Rebroadcasted it on, well, yesterday.  There were two versions of the show, by the way, for the first time.  Yeah, we really tested this free FM satellite radio thing yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah, because, ah, how do we explain this?  Well, if you're listening to us on free FM right now.  Or any of the other FM affiliates we have around the country.  True, true, true.  What you're hearing is also pretty much being heard on XM. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Except for when they dump out, XM gets to hear the, ah, the uncensored version every morning.  When we say something naughty.  So they get to hear a few curses, a few extra curses.  Yeah.  Ah, but yesterday it was two completely different broadcasts.  Because it was taped that night and then, ah, aired the next morning.  So, ah, people had time to paw over it.  And they made an XM version and a terrestrial radio version.  And very different shows.  Really?  Extremely different shows, yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Interesting.  Yeah, because, you know, we have faithful listeners that go to all the events and they thought it'd be really, really funny to, ah, start FU chants and stuff.  Yeah, are they the same people that get on the message boards and bash, ah, the show that we do when we're out live and broadcasting at the same time and go, ah, just, you know, it doesn't sound good.  Because they're cursing in the background or yelling over what we're trying to do.  Yeah.  Never again, by the way. 
[00:04:30]  We're trying to broadcast a Halloween show for everybody and I'm looking in the crowd and I saw who was doing it.  Yeah.  And you will be punished, trust me.  You're not that, ah, you're not that strong on the message boards.  You're going to see how weak you really are.  But he thought it would be really funny to start, you know, ah, F free FM chants and stuff as we're trying to broadcast a show and get something that is usable the next day.  Yeah, we need stuff that's usable that we can put on the air and, ah, you know, just get jackasses.  You can't call yourself a hardcore fan if you're the guy, you know, starting F free FM chants. 
[00:05:00]  Screwing the show up.  Because you thought it would be funny.  Screwing us up so bad that we had to wait for the chance to die down and then try to start up again.  You made the show a complete nightmare.  And you pretty much just screwed over the guys, all the guys that had to hang out and edit the show.  Right.  For the next morning.  I saw who it was with his fist in the air.  He thought it would be fun.  He thought it would be funny. 
[00:05:30]  You know, I understand one or two of those.  But to do it throughout the whole broadcast where you make it really tough for Anthony and I and little Jimmy Norton and the staff back at the stations to edit the whole thing.  You're not doing us any favor.  If we're not broadcasting.  Favors.  Who cares?  If we're just out doing a live show, doing a road show, yell what you want.  It doesn't matter.  I don't care.  But when we're broadcasting, and that's why we said we just don't like doing broadcasts at live shows.  We've said it. 
[00:06:00]  How many times have we said it?  And somehow we get bamboozled and roped into doing it again.  We were just kind of saying before the show today that we were talked into it.  No, we had no choice.  Yeah.  We had no choice.  We had to do it.  We had to do it.  You know, it turned out all right.  Yeah, it turned out.  The broadcast was all right, but.  For the most part, there were a few things that happened that were like, oh, Jesus Christ, this is going to be a pain in the ass to deal with.  And then, okay, I can see this hour is going to be cut out. 
[00:06:30]  Right, right.  The ticket distribution stunk.  Yeah.  Right from the start.  It stunk.  Ticket distribution.  What did we start giving away three days before the event?  That was horrible the way that was handled.  Yeah.  Horrible.  Yeah.  And then the Flava Flav debacle.  Well, he kind of hijacked the show, which didn't help matters.  70 of his posse on stage.  Do we need him to introduce every single person in his family and his posse and everyone he grew up with and people that just dropped in? 
[00:07:00]  I don't think he knew that it was like all going to just be like, I don't think he knew he wasn't going to be announced.  Like as far as, I think he probably figured it'd be like, eh.  Jimmy, I was telling.  My New York audience.  Yeah, exactly.  I was telling Anthony, you know, in the office before the show today, Flava Flav thought we were all on that stage just waiting for him to run.  Waiting for him.  He had no clue we were broadcasting a Halloween show and that he was just one small piece.  He thought it was a showcase for Flava Flav and what he's up to now. 
[00:07:30]  And he just completely came out and hijacked the show.  Also proven that Whitey's just scared of Darky.  Yeah.  I mean, look, I'll be the first to admit the best I could do in the middle of Flava Flav completely hijacking our Halloween show was to go Flava Flav, everyone.  Yeah, Flava Flav, everyone, hoping that would give him a little hint.  To get off the stage.  To get off.  That was the best I could do.  Yeah.  And Patrice O'Neill was looking at me laughing his ass off. 
[00:08:00]  Everyone was.  From what I heard, Ron and Fez, Ronnie had the best time.  He was laughing at how uncomfortable we were and how powerless we were to do anything about it.  For the people that didn't, well, you know what?  You didn't hear this yesterday.  I think CBS, the CBS version of our Halloween show, they only had maybe four or five minutes of Flava Flav.  Oh, really?  The reality was he was on stage for 55 minutes.  Yeah.  Because we timed it.  We timed it.  He came out and we thought we were going to get a quick hi, what's up, maybe an acknowledgement that he was even on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:08:30]  Do one or two songs because Chuck D was there.  So we got a little, you know, public enemy thing way late into the set, which was really, really cool.  But we thought we'd get a quick, like, brand new song from Flava Flav, maybe an oldie with Chuck D.  Dude, by that point, when they brought out Chuck, I didn't care if he brought out Martin Luther King at that point.  It had been long enough that he was on stage.  Yeah.  Get off. 
[00:09:00]  It was really bizarre, man.  Well, so he comes out, says hi, and then there was a posse that, let's not exaggerate, was it 40, 50 people?  Yeah.  Dude, at least.  At least 40 or 50 people.  And it was right in the middle of our mummy mousetrap, glue trap thing.  We were right in the middle of doing it.  They were just ready to rip it off.  Yeah.  And him and 40 of his posse come out on stage in the middle of it.  And just completely took over the stage, which wrecked the energy of that bit we were attempting to do. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, my God.  And then Flava Flav proceeds to take the next 20 minutes to introduce every single person in his posse.  In his posse.  And who cared, really?  Come on, now.  Who cared?  He thought that that was, and he really did think, which he really thought, like, okay, this is like a whole Flava Flav thing for me.  Yeah, he didn't know.  He thought it was a party for him.  Because I said, look, I'll say one thing.  He didn't take the money and run.  No.  He came out, said hello.  He stayed there and didn't even have a clue who we were. 
[00:10:00]  No.  Dude, he did not have a clue who we were.  Never mentioned.  He's thanking everybody.  Never mentioned Opie and Anthony had no clue.  And he's done our show before.  Of course.  So, you know, don't think we're sounding pompous.  I mean, he's done our show.  He's been in our studio.  He was in our studio, had a good time.  Didn't have a clue that there was a radio show going on.  Had no clue who we were.  That it was our show that night and he was a guest on the show. 
[00:10:30]  I kind of, I was on a couple of the message boards and one of them, you know, whack bag.  I'm always on there.  And I posted, because a lot of people are like, what the hell are the guys thinking having him as a guest just taking over the show like that?  And I posted, it was supposed to be like Hulk Hogan was last year.  Hulk came out with his family.  He was just starting up with the show.  Hulk Hogan sat down.  He was a guest.  Said a few things. 
[00:11:00]  Did his little shtick that he does at the front of the stage.  You know, rips his shirt off and stuff.  Hey, brother.  And left.  That was it.  He was a guest.  That's how that was supposed to be.  Flay was going to come out.  I assumed we were going to talk with him for a little bit.  He was then going to go to the stage, perform a little bit, and then leave.  Right.  A segment of the show.  Not almost the whole show.  It was 55 minutes.  Like I said, we timed it.  He was introducing people almost like he felt like he had to do time. 
[00:11:30]  Like he felt like.  Yeah.  He came out at first and like for like 10 minutes, you know, he was just saying hello to the crowd and getting everyone to chant.  Oh, you know, just.  And then he's just like, I'm going to go back and come back out.  It was like almost like he felt like he had to fill some time.  Like he couldn't just come out and do two songs.  All right.  What do I do to fill time?  Yeah.  I have to.  So did someone not get to him and maybe tell him what what this was?  I don't know.  So obviously didn't know.  Did it was everybody so petrified that they did not want to approach him because he had just what appeared to be the best bank robbing squad I've ever seen in my life. 
[00:12:00]  And his security was intimidating.  Oh, people he was with were intimidating.  You don't know how many weapons were on that stage.  And I know that's kind of like a racist thing to say.  But in reality, some of those guys.  It ain't no racist thing to say.  Some of those guys had some some action.  I was afraid of his moms.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the point.  I was an older black woman.  I was afraid of her.  Noah's great.  Well, Flavor Flay was doing. 
[00:12:30]  How many songs did he end up doing?  Three or four for you?  Three or four.  I think that's all it was.  There were pieces of about six songs, I would say.  I think he only did three or four songs.  And the rest was him, you know, introducing his entire family and all his friends.  And Patrice is like just kind of grooving with the music.  He's got his hands like kind of moving.  He understands exactly what's going on.  He understands why Flay had to introduce everybody on the stage.  He was completely, you know, understanding of what was going on. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  You said that right.  And I look at Patrice and I go, dude, now I know how you feel, man.  Now I know how you feel because I'm sitting here like, you know, because Patrice is basically  a black man in our white world as far as this radio show goes.  He's like kind of the outsider.  And for once, I was the outsider as I'm looking at Patrice, completely enjoying himself.  Powerless.  Because he just understood exactly what was going on on that stage.  We were just powerless to do anything.  People were like, why didn't you do this or that or the other thing. 
[00:13:30]  With that security team and his posse.  And from what I'm hearing now, one of our fans, her sister, got her purse stolen right  off of her, allegedly by one of his posse.  She saw this?  Just laughing.  Yeah.  Laughing and grabbed the purse off her arm and just walked away with it.  Come on.  I'm not kidding, dude.  I've been reading all weekend about what happened.  People actually saw this. 
[00:14:00]  There's witnesses.  Witnesses.  This happened.  There were other very close, near altercations right outside the place.  I thought there was going to be some kind of...  That were only stuff.  There was a lot of name calling back and forth with the posse.  And just something that I knew was going to happen.  Right.  Oh, by the way, you know, to the person that started the F3FM chants, because you thought  that was just hilarious.  And you call yourself an uber fan of the O.P. and Anthony show, screwing up our broadcast 
[00:14:30]  from time to time.  Where was the F Flavor Flav chant?  Where was the F Flavor Flav chant?  You ass.  Where was that?  When Patrice came out and they all started with the N chant.  Where was that one there when there was 50 on stage?  Yeah.  Where was that?  Look, man.  You know, a lot of the audience enjoyed the performance, but they didn't enjoy the fact  that he was there for 55 minutes.  So why didn't you start the, you know, the F Flav chant? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  You pussy.  They're no better than we are.  Honestly, God did not find his group intimidating.  The only two guys I thought were pretty intense were the two security guys that were around  him at all times.  It was two guys.  And I kept watching this one dude stage left.  I saw a stage left guy.  And he was the real deal.  He had a vest on and all he was doing was scanning the audience.  It's interesting to watch rap security guys.  They're so different than anybody we deal with because they really do have a threat of 
[00:15:30]  guns in almost every venue they're in.  And he was, it was like watching a cyborg.  It was a left, right, up, down, left, right, up, down.  He, this guy looked at every, he was like watching Secret Service.  And the same thing happened at an MTV thing I was at.  There was a guy who I recognized.  He was behind one of these like pop stars, chick pop star.  And he was literally six inches behind her at all times with his arms out like he was  going, huh?  Like an old Jewish man's arms.  Huh?  Huh?  Right.  He's a big, big white dude.  And I'm like, where do I know you from? 
[00:16:00]  And he goes, I used to do security for 50.  And I'm like, that's where, that's where I, he was one of the security guards at the  airport that kind of got annoyed at me when I asked if he sent for a picture.  Well, he should have.  And this guy was six inches behind her and looked, no one could get near her.  These guys are great security guys, man.  So those are the only two guys I found to be kind of intense were the two immediate  guys around.  Speaking of Flavor Flav, by the way, this little article in the Daily News today, Flavor Flav,  former public enemy MC and star of VH1's hit show Flavor of Love is certainly spreading  the love.  He's expecting his seventh child. 
[00:16:30]  Of course.  He's expecting his seventh child.  What's more, the mother of baby number seven is not one of the two mamas of his other six  kids, nor one of the two winners of his Looking for Love reality show.  Yeah.  I'm a huge fan of Flavor of Love, by the way.  I saw the second season and he picked Delicious.  Yeah.  Well, we found out backstage, but they don't want this to be known.  But what the hell, let's blow up his spot a little bit.  Him and Delicious are completely done. 
[00:17:00]  Completely done.  But he's writing out the publicity of Flavor of Love and stuff.  So they're going to announce that probably in the next few weeks or so.  But this item might push him along.  It continues.  When things didn't work out with Hoops, season one winner, he started dating a woman that  he's been dating on and off for a while.  Flav's manager told us they're expecting early January.  And yes, Delicious, season two winner, London Charles, is aware.  But like I just told you, they're not an item anymore. 
[00:17:30]  No, no.  You don't know what to think with him.  So it was, I don't know, it was an interesting broadcast.  I hated it.  It's just too stressful from where we sit.  It was fun, though.  At the end of it, though, was backstage when everybody had cleared out.  We were all ready to go.  I was watching Flav and this guy.  It was Chuck D was hanging out.  There was two security guys and a couple of his close.  People, Chuck D, Flav, and this other guy from his group, and Flav and the other guy 
[00:18:00]  were just trashing each other the same way we do at the Cellar.  Your mother's this.  It was so, it was really fun while your Hoops saw it.  They were just kind of like, it was kind of fun to watch them just doing that.  And maybe they should have done that on stage.  Well, you know, I don't think they knew.  I don't blame them totally.  They didn't know.  Flav came thinking he had, this was his gig.  He wasn't being a dick.  He wasn't trying to be rude to anybody.  He wasn't trying to, he was trying to do, I think, what he thought he was supposed to do,  which was fill the time.  Maybe he should have been more informed.  Before he got there, yeah.  Yeah, I don't think he had a clue. 
[00:18:30]  I don't think he purposely hijacked our show.  All right.  Let's go to Jim in Brooklyn.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  I got to tell you, for the people who listened to the free FM show yesterday,  you have to hear the XM show.  The boys were on.  That first break when you guys were backstage, I don't think I've laughed that hard in a while.  I think that stuff all made it onto them.  Yeah, that's, the show yesterday was definitely schizo because the stuff we did backstage was unbelievable. 
[00:19:00]  Some of the best radio we've done in a while.  And then the, you know, the onstage broadcast was, it was all right.  It was what it was.  It was okay.  I'm not proud of it.  It was just, it was, it was okay.  It was, it was, it was okay.  Oh, the guy's going back.  But, but, yeah, but, but the, yeah, in the green room, man, that stuff was just amazing stuff.  Yeah.  I was great at that, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Sonny Farrelly.  Sonny, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  Yeah, listen, I'm sorry I wasn't able to make it.  But then again, now that I think about it, I'm really not kind of sorry.  I mean, one of my biggest pet peeves about the whole show yesterday was, you know, 
[00:19:30]  how the hardcore fans were disrespecting 3FM and the Halloween party.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, thanks for the help, guys.  I really appreciate it.  It wasn't, it is really, really, really hard to do a live show in front of an audience.  It's almost impossible because there's so many factors involved.  You got, you got eight microphones on at the same time.  So you, so everyone has to be on the same page and, and not talk over each other.  And then you got to make it sound good for the people at home, but you also got to make  it sound good for the crowd. 
[00:20:00]  And the last thing you need is like hardcore quote, faithful quote, Uber fan listeners,  you know, starting, you know, FU chants, knowing that we're trying to get this on regular radio.  Here's how we could, we could have done it.  And this is how other people supposedly, you know, pull off the live broadcast.  They don't go in front of the fans, right?  They find a place like, like the backstage portion of the broadcast.  They find a place, they broadcast back there very, very occasionally. 
[00:20:30]  They'll go out and, um, maybe gather up some fans, talk to them, tape it a lot of times,  edit it down on the fly and play it.  Uh, it's usually a music show that's out like that.  So they could cut to tunes, things like that to do the entire show in front of a live audience  is nearly impossible.  No one does it for that reason.  Right.  I wrote a whole thread on it on Wackbag, and I'm just very surprised that a lot of the XMers  just don't get it.  I just don't understand it, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, yeah, Ope made a great point by saying they really don't understand what we're trying 
[00:21:00]  to do with this show and what we've been trying to do with this show since we've started  the biggest comeback in radio history.  Right.  This is all part of it.  You expect FU chants from maybe, you know, some Howard Stern fans that got into the venue  or something.  Not from your own people.  Yeah.  Not from your own people.  I couldn't believe that was going on.  Yeah, just screw up the broadcast.  Because it was hard enough trying to, you know, make something out of, you know, out  of, out of what?  Out of crap. 
[00:21:30]  We basically had crap that we were trying to mold into something, and you didn't help  us along there.  Nigel in Kentucky, what's up?  Good morning.  I just heard the replay of the Halloween show on XM, and the parts that you guys had control  of was, you know, it was good for a live broadcast.  But when your show, or when the live broadcast got hijacked by that rap concert, it just  went downhill.  You know, it's one for the ages, though, man.  I got to tell you.  The time that Flavor Flav hijacked one of our live broadcasts completely. 
[00:22:00]  I have never wished sickle cell syndrome on anybody more in my life.  Here it goes.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Geez.  Let's say hi to Jay in New York.  We got to take a break.  But Jay, what's up?  Hey, Jay.  Jay?  Everyone.  Jim?  Oh, Jim.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, I just wanted to quote all the other fans on Cigars and Scotch, and I started the  na-na-na-na-na-hey-hey-goodbye chant.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Everyone was laughing at us.  Heard that one. 
[00:22:30]  And they're giggling.  I'm sorry, man.  Go ahead.  I apologize.  That's it?  Yeah, I stepped on you.  I didn't mean to.  I just wanted to say, I mean, it was a great show.  Even with Flavor Flavor, I mean, it was just such a train wreck at the end.  It was great.  It was classic.  Well, to be honest, I think everyone that was at the Hard Rock Cafe had a great time.  You know, so we took care of that part, but we also have to take care of the radio audience.  And I think we pulled that off as well in the end, but it was a lot of work, man.  Thank you, Jim.  Great show, guys.  All right.  Let's stay hot.  My biggest problem was the ticket distribution and the way it was done. 
[00:23:00]  And let's be very honest, there was a really great-sized crowd there.  There should have been more people, but it wasn't due to lack of interest.  It was because people were afraid to come down.  A girl I know couldn't get in.  The Hard Rock wouldn't let her in.  And that's probably the instructions they were giving.  She's like, I'm outside.  They weren't letting people in.  Yeah, well, my girlfriend had a couple of friends that really almost didn't get in.  She had to find Hard Rock Johnny and get him to go to the door, and that's only because she can, and let people in. 
[00:23:30]  They weren't to capacity.  No.  So what was the problem when people wanted to come in that they weren't letting – and they were on the list.  They were on my personal list.  That – the distribution of the backstage credentials was another problem I had.  Flav, all his people are walking around wherever the hell they wanted to go.  They went, believe me.  They were walking around anywhere they wanted to go.  And then at the end of the night, my sister comes up and goes, me and Patrick tried to get backstage to get my stuff, which was in your guys' room. 
[00:24:00]  And we're told we can't go back there.  And she's got like a crappy pass that anybody can get.  My own sister couldn't have an all-access pass.  What the hell is that all about?  Meanwhile, you know, 70 of Flav's posse are going wherever the hell they want to go.  It was just a – you know, those are the things that didn't make the air.  Right.  But on a personal level, just pissed me off royal. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  The fact that fans weren't being let in.  Well, we announced, too, that you could get into the show.  Yeah, you could get in.  Just show up and get in.  Just show up, so.  We announced – I think we announced that even after the fact because people were so annoyed for so long with the way tickets – I had no idea.  I'm on the show and I didn't – I'm like, did we get any tickets out?  Yeah.  And I know – look, I understand that both XM, Free FM, everyone has interest in getting a certain amount of tickets and get – great.  But all – we should have had a completely packed house.  Yeah.  People were so irritated that they couldn't get tickets. 
[00:25:00]  They weren't getting – they weren't allowed in.  And that's why the – what the Hard Rock was told to do.  They were probably told to do that.  You can't just let everybody in.  By who?  I have no idea.  What is this bureaucracy that we have that we don't know?  There's no single person to yell at.  Oh, it's beautiful.  That's –  It really is beautiful.  That's America, man.  Because no matter what issue is brought up about this whole broadcast, there's no one single person that you can walk up to and go, so, you're the guy.  Right.  You're the guy.  Why didn't this, this, this happen? 
[00:25:30]  Because no matter who you go to, they ship you off to somebody else and say, oh, talk to this one because this one was in charge of this and that one was in charge of that.  It was just a cluster F.  All right, we got to take a break, but the phones are just slamming about the show.  Stye in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You know, love you guys.  Love everything about you guys.  But listen, you guys need to shut the F up about this.  Why?  Listen, Flay and Chucky and whatever public enemy, they did a great show for you guys. 
[00:26:00]  Did they?  Dude, it wasn't that they did a bad show and that their singing stunk or the performance stunk.  It was a fact there was a lot of stuff around it that didn't have to happen and it shouldn't have happened because it took too long in the middle of a show that was to be broadcast.  But he obviously didn't know that.  He came out, he didn't know that.  I don't think you're getting the point that this is a live broadcast that we don't just go up there and wing it.  Like, it's pretty much scheduled.  We have a schedule of things that we have to get to in order to make it sound like anything the next day. 
[00:26:30]  And that completely threw a monkey wrench into the works of what we were trying to do.  We wanted him for 10, maybe 15 minutes tops, not 55, bro.  And to prove that he...  It wasn't a Flavor Flay show.  It was an Opie and Anthony Halloween show.  And Flavor Flay was one of the things we were going to do.  He probably thought it was like a VH1 thing.  He had no idea because, first of all, he didn't thank the show, which means he didn't know.  So, second of all, why else would he choose?  Because him and Chuck D hadn't performed in New York in quite a while. 
[00:27:00]  And I heard a lot of the people like BET, a lot of them wanted to get those guys together.  Why would he choose the Opie and Anthony show?  I mean, you just wouldn't.  You wouldn't.  You wouldn't of all the places to finally bring Chuck D out.  He probably figured, this is my homecoming.  It's a show in Times Square in New York.  It's a Flavor Flay show.  This is what I'm going to do.  He thought it was like a party thrown for him on Halloween.  And Stye.  He thought everyone was there for him.  Yeah, exactly.  How do you think they felt?  He should have really paid attention to who was in the audience, and he would have realized they weren't there for him. 
[00:27:30]  Did you see security?  He was scanning that hard, probably trying to find another black person.  Yeah, to look at.  They couldn't believe probably when they walked into the situation and saw what they saw.  Wow, Flay, you're really crossing over.  Yeah, he's a crossover artist now because of his VH1 show.  Hey, Stye, I enjoyed some of the stuff he was doing.  Absolutely.  I didn't enjoy him introducing his entire family and all his friends.  That's what I was going to say.  You thought that was entertaining, him introducing everybody on stage? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, if I was you, I'd be like, thank God he stretched for me for an hour.  And number two, I'd be pissed that nobody from my side told him exactly what was going on.  I agree.  That's what I agree.  All right, Stye.  Thank you.  Yeah.  We didn't really need him to stretch.  Trust me.  I had Tom getting in my face backstage like, we got to end this.  We got, we're in overtime now.  I'm like, overtime for what?  We're doing our Halloween party.  We'll end when we want to end.  And then it's up to you guys to try to make this into a radio show the next day.  But he's getting in my face. 
[00:28:30]  And I'm like, look, we're not going to use all that Flavor Flav thing.  It happened.  It sucks.  We didn't want it to go down that way.  You know, why though, before we go to break, end on a sour note with this whole thing.  I must say, girls, girls, girls last night, the other night though.  Amazing.  The number of girls and the number of attractive girls that wanted and did get up on stage and showed their goods to the crowd above last year.  Amazing.  Yeah.  I think I'm in love with Baby Girl. 
[00:29:00]  What?  Wow.  All right.  She looked good.  The line forms to the left, Jimmy.  No, no, but you don't understand.  This is true love.  It's not just, I want to have sex with her.  I mean, certainly that's where it starts, but that's not awesome.  It's hysterical.  It's hysterical.  And we had, you know, if we needed girls, boom, they were up on the stage.  It wasn't like begging or pleading and they were more than happy to really entertain the crowd.  So bravo to the ladies.  Even Baby Girl was wowing.  Yeah.  No. 
[00:29:30]  I'm kidding.  There were a lot of positive things that happened that night.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  A lot of pictures are going to be up on opianthony.com.  I already saw some up on the message boards.  Some of the funniest pictures are the looks on our three faces when Flav was up there.  I guess this was probably minute 40.  And it's the three of us making the same disgusted face with the microphones in front of us.  Just kind of looking like, oh, Jesus, how long is this going to go on? 
[00:30:00]  And being white, we all knew without communicating there was nothing we could do.  Oh, there was nothing.  It wasn't like we were kind of whispering, like, all right, what do we do here?  We just knew.  Just waited out.  His people knew it, too, though.  Flav's people knew this was a weird situation.  Yeah.  They all walked out.  They're done a Flav in public enemy shows.  They know that there's white guys.  I made a whitey joke to him in the audience, you know, the fact that the audience is all white and everything.  I made a little joke about that.  And what did you say again? 
[00:30:30]  I was hoping.  It's something to the effect of he was asking a question.  I can't remember what it was, but I answered the question really quickly by pointing out that.  What's that?  Oh, you got it here?  Oh, we got it.  Oh, where, where, where?  We were supposed to break like 10 minutes ago.  Which one?  Three.  Oh, OK.  It's Sam.  Oh, we got it.  Sam, Sam.  That kid's good.  Wow.  This is what you had to say.  Yo, check this out, y'all.  I just want to say, too, for the first time ever in my life. 
[00:31:00]  You've been in front of this many white people.  Wrong.  Hey, yo.  Can I tell you something?  Hey, yo.  Can I tell y'all something?  Yeah.  Tell us.  He's wrong because I've been in front of Moorwood when I was on tour with you, too.  Y'all need to know that.  All right.  But I love you anyway, though.  I get it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It went on and on.  Andrew, California.  What's up?  It was a joke, Flav.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, relax.  Go with it.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Colin Quinn's got the line of the evening when he calls Bob Kelly, Genghis, um, gosh.  Oh, don't curse.  Don't curse.  He didn't curse.  He didn't curse.  You stink.  All right, all right.  He's the only screen.  We'll have to break.  How about this?  We'll break and come back, and I'll tell you my favorite Colin line, because Colin,  killed.  Hilarious.  Well, Andrew from California said that Colin Quinn backstage had the line of the night. 
[00:32:00]  Here it is.  Chuck D, man.  Oh, Chuck D just shut up.  Chuck D.  Are they going to do something?  Wow.  Are they going to do a little something?  This could be the reunion of the year.  You know what we can do?  Can I see that for a second?  No, Genghis Deluise.  Wow.  I don't like that Quinn went into a room and roast.  He's trying to make a comeback.  He's trying to make a comeback on your damn Halloween show.  Oh, God, man.  Well, I was just going to say, we can get...  Shut it down.  That shut it. 
[00:32:30]  Bobby, stop.  I know.  Just let it go.  We can get that.  He calls you two fat people from different times.  He calls you a 14th century fat man and a 20th century fat man of completely different  race.  Oh, my gosh.  I don't like...  Yeah, he looked at Bob Kelly and came up with that line.  And that wasn't even my favorite Colin line.  What was it?  Real fast, Jimmy.  Because we're going to move on to your...  Do we have the line about when he said to Bob, you look like, and he said, a last-minute 
[00:33:00]  gift?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He told Bob Kelly, which I...  It was one of the best things I've ever heard Colin say.  And I hope I don't misquote him.  He said to Bob, you look like a last-minute gift in the Beijing airport.  That, to me, was probably the funniest line I've heard in five years.  Colin was on fire.  Colin's coming in today, by the way.  That is exactly what Bob looks like.  A little, fat, last-minute gift.  It was perfect.  It's like, oh, I got to pick up something for someone.  Let me get this.  That's like finding, like, a diamond, and all you got to do is just, and you can sell 
[00:33:30]  it.  That was brilliant, man.  All right, we got to take a break.  We're real late.  I still want Colin dead, but that was a great one.  Colin's coming in at 8 o'clock.

Anthony, you have to mention Ron's line from yesterday about public enemy reuniting on your  Halloween show, being like Slash and Axel starting up Guns N' Roses again at a Hot 97 event.  That is a brilliant line from Ron, from Ron and Fez.  Yeah, it was the wrong, uh, I don't know. 
[00:34:30]  The wrong kind.  Wrong kind.  Hey, I went to Letterman with Jim yesterday.  Yeah, Jimmy was on Letterman.  We haven't even been able to talk about, uh, Jim Norton being on David Letterman last night.  Absolutely killed!  I was happy.  He killed.  Thank you for coming.  Nice dressing friends.  Little friends, are you in the little dressing room?  Open, Lindsay.  It was kind of nice to go to Letterman and not have the pressure of going out there. 
[00:35:00]  It was a lot more fun.  Yeah, huh?  Just sitting around, like, with my feet up, going, ah!  No pressure.  It was no pressure whatsoever, and Jimmy looked great.  His set was great.  One observation, unfortunately, I gotta say it on the show.  I didn't realize how sick Jimmy really is with his, uh, celebrity photos.  How could you not?  It's just, he's always been this bad.  No, no.  He took it to a new level.  A new level?  A new effin' level last night. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, boy.  Just when I thought I've seen it all with Jim Norton.  I've been backstage at Metallica, where we had to sit around almost two hours after the show,  waiting for the perfect time to go up to the guys to get the photo.  What'd you do?  I've told that story many, many times.  Dude, you know, upstairs in the dressing rooms and stuff?  Of course, I know.  Yeah, it's nice.  It's nice that we can all relate to the Letterman green rooms and the upstairs portion and stuff.  Sure.  So there's Jimmy.  I love a place like the back of my hand.  There's Jimmy. 
[00:36:00]  He's in his room.  His suit is hanging up.  He's, you know, waiting for makeup.  And, uh, we're all there excited for little Jimmy Norton.  All he cares about is getting a freakin' picture with Gary Sinise.  Gary Sinise, pretty cool.  Yeah.  Who was also on the show.  Yeah, it's pretty cool that Gary Sinise was on, and it's pretty cool to try to get a picture with Gary Sinise.  But he's about ready to go on Letterman himself.  He doesn't even care about his, I mean, in my mind, how I saw it, he doesn't even care that he's going on Letterman.  And all he cares about is getting his picture with Gary Sinise. 
[00:36:30]  It's a photo op.  He's got people going all the way downstairs to five or six floors to search out where Gary is because he's not on the same level as Jim Norton.  And, uh, you know, check makeup.  Is he down there?  Just, you know, call me, and I'll go down immediately, and we'll get the picture done before he goes.  Because I know when he goes on Letterman, as soon as he's done, he's leaving.  So we got to get it before.  Like, just, and I'm like, oh, my God.  This would be all right if we're just kind of hanging out at an event.  But it's Jim Norton.  He's getting ready to go on Letterman, and this is all he cares about is getting a picture with Gary Sinise. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, man.  I was like, because the dressing room, people don't know, it's a little different than Leno.  When you go to the Tonight Show, you walk, it's all on one level.  You go to, uh, there's dressing room one, dressing room two, and, uh, the stage is there.  And then the entrance to the stage is between them, really.  Upstairs is where the bands go.  They have a bigger dressing room area upstairs, like, one little flight of steps right above you for bands,  because they know that bands have, like, 12, 15 people in them.  Yeah.  But it's all very close together.  You're literally a three-second walk from the stage entrance.  So it's a different setup, whereas at Letterman, you take an elevator up to the sixth floor, 
[00:37:30]  because in New York, everything goes up for real estate.  You can't have it all spread out.  Yep.  But all willy-nilly.  Brawling.  So upstairs are the dressing rooms.  There's dressing rooms one and two, I think, right?  Or three.  There's three dressing rooms, and Sinise was in one, I was in the middle one,  and then Joanne Carson was in the last one.  Oh, he was up there for a little while?  No, but there was a dressing room that was his.  Oh, yeah, but he never was up there, because that would have made it so much easier for everybody involved.  So I finally got Joanne Carson.  She was very nice.  And then I got...  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that. 
[00:38:00]  Johnny Carson's old wife was there.  Oh, right, yeah.  And, you know, she was right next door to Jim Norton, and Jimmy got that picture taken care of.  He got that one out of the way.  See, he was going for the trifecta.  He wanted Joanne Carson, he wanted Gary Sinise, and he wanted David Letterman.  All right.  Good luck.  Well, I'll say that Sinise, I finally got after his segment.  You did?  How did you get that?  Well, I knew his segment.  Jonathan, my manager, was down there talking to him for like 10 minutes in the dressing room.  He was like, I was texting Pete for you to come down. 
[00:38:30]  So I came down after his segment, and right outside the room, I actually talked to him for a few minutes, took a couple pictures.  What did you say to him?  I talked to him about what a brilliant actor I thought he was.  He was very nice, man.  He was very, very conversational.  And I asked him how it was to play McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest on Broadway.  And then I was talking back to him.  I saw that show.  Was it good?  Yeah.  Yeah, he said it was really intense.  And I asked him about my hands, of course.  The same nonsense you hear on the air.  That's what I did.  And he was very funny.  He's like, I don't want to do my hands either.  He's like, don't put them in your pockets.  He's like, I can't put them in my pockets.  Sometimes I find a wall to lean on. 
[00:39:00]  Gary Sinise has to talk about it after he does Letterman.  He has to explain to some middle from Jersey what to do with his hands in the middle of the scene.  I just love that every actor now has to let us in on that little secret.  And give you advice on what to do with your hands.  Right.  And so I do this set and I come off.  Wait, wait.  But you got the picture with Gary Sinise?  Oh, yeah.  I got a couple of them.  Did you explain that?  Yeah, yeah.  I sent you a couple of pictures.  I want to see that.  But this was literally minutes before he was going on.  I'm like, this is unbelievable.  He's not just trying to get his thoughts together.  It was like he couldn't do anything until he got that photo. 
[00:39:30]  And thank God he got it before he went on because I think he was able to just now clear his mind  and have the set that he did, which was awesome.  I mean, that's a credit to Jimmy because, you know, he's done these shows before and he could just go out and do things like that.  Meanwhile, me and you are in the dressing room looking at the monitor going, just like obsessing about when we're going on.  Sorry, man.  You're giving him way too much credit.  No.  Okay.  It's a sickness.  It's a sickness.  Part of it is.  He's willing to just destroy his whole set on Letterman to get pictures. 
[00:40:00]  It's a sickness.  You're letting him off the hook here.  Well, to be honest, there is a part of it.  Yes, he is a professional, but.  It's pushing.  It's almost pushing away the magnitude of the event.  It's like you are, in a way, going on television in front of however many millions of people.  And you don't want to look at it in those terms.  And so there are times where I'm grateful for that stupid part of me.  To obsess on something.  Because it's really what I was thinking of.  And I knew my set was down.  I had my set.  So I don't want to panic about that.  So I started focusing on the other stuff a little bit heavier.  And Letterman was the picture I really wanted, of course. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, wow.  And that was the greatest thing ever.  Jim gets off.  Like, he does his set.  The show ends.  Jimmy was at the end of the show.  And he gets off stage, goes right into that green room, right to the right there.  Yeah.  And we're all, like, just so happy for Jim.  Like, Jim, you killed.  You looked great.  We're saying it was the best he's ever looked on TV.  Everything was, we really thought was perfect, okay?  And not even a smile on Jim's face.  He's like, we've got to get a picture with Letterman. 
[00:41:00]  I mean, he just got off stage.  Dude, seconds.  Seconds.  Got to get a picture with Letterman.  And so he starts asking the staff.  And they're all like,  Oh, well, ah, hmm.  The way Dave does, Leto's different.  Leto comes in the dressing room before the show.  He talks to you.  He hangs.  The Letterman doesn't do any of that.  He's just a different guy, man.  He's just, and everyone knows that.  He's just, he's just, I guess, a little psychotic.  Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered. 
[00:41:30]  And right after the show, his ritual is, he comes off the stage, goes right up the steps  and right back to the offices.  It's just what he does.  They actually clear the hallway.  Clear the hallway.  And I don't know.  I got the, I was assuming that people aren't allowed to look at him.  I was under the assumption that there's.  Really?  Yeah.  There's a ritual.  And part of it is to just let him walk immediately from the stage back to the office.  He probably has some kind of ritual that he's done every night for this many years. 
[00:42:00]  And Jimmy was pushing it.  Jimmy was pushing it.  I didn't care, though.  It's like, you know what?  I'm not afraid of him.  And not to be a jerk.  Jimmy was pushing one of the girls, and she's like, I couldn't even ask him.  I can't even ask him.  And it's obvious she's been working for the show for a while.  And she wants to continue.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, when he's walking.  Yeah, but you know what?  For a guest to say, I would like a photo with the host.  I don't know.  I just don't find that to be too crazy.  I don't find a guest saying, hi, I was just on your show.  I would like a photo with you because I enjoy getting photos. 
[00:42:30]  And I was just on your show.  I would like a photo.  I don't think that's crazy.  It's not like, hey, look, my uncle helped you move back in 88.  Can I have a photo?  I think once you perform on somebody's show, to say, can I have a photo with you three minutes later is appropriate.  I completely agree with you.  And when he walked off.  Well, can I just add really fast?  So then, yeah, we're doing the right thing because we're there for Jimmy.  So we're mingling right at the bottom of the stairs there.  Yeah.  We're just mingling like, all right, well, she's not going to ask, but maybe he'll just, you know, he'll walk right by us and there'll be an opportunity. 
[00:43:00]  Hey, Mr. Letterman, can we get a quick picture, right?  And I think she caught on to us.  She's like, you guys, could you kind of clear the hall?  Jimmy was just on the show.  And on TV, they're like buddy-buddy at the end, like, Jimmy, great set.  And if you saw the appearance, the show pretty much ends with Dave and Jimmy on stage together looking like pals, right?  Sure.  It is a completely different thing as soon as that show's over because now she's like kind of pushing us.  Like, could you guys clear the hallway?  He's about ready to come walk through here. 
[00:43:30]  There's a protocol.  And I don't want to lose my job, so we push back to the elevator.  But Jimmy's kind of pretty much still, you know, at the bottom of the stairs because he's not going to give up that easily.  Where's the camera at this point?  Where's the camera?  Oh, ready to go.  He had it ready to go.  Ready to go.  So Letterman walks out.  He has no suit jacket on.  He took it off.  And I nodded at him.  He said, you know, hey, Jim, thanks for coming.  Great job.  He said great set.  Yeah, he's complimenting.  Yeah, yeah.  And we shook hands.  But he said it as he was walking up the steps. 
[00:44:00]  And I knew I could have asked him for a photo.  That probably would have been the optimum time right there.  And I know he would have stopped.  He wouldn't have said no.  But it would have been awkward for everybody involved.  It would have been awkward for the other people there and for the staffer.  So I didn't.  Because I knew I was like, I have some of the screen cap.  And I was depressed and annoyed at myself.  Had Pete and I been the only ones there, I absolutely would have asked him.  But it was just, I knew he had like, you could tell by the way he was walking.  He wasn't trying to be a dick.  He wasn't being rude.  He goes off and he walks up the steps.  That's what he does.  Right.  This wasn't about rudeness. 
[00:44:30]  This was about maybe he just does.  I don't know what his thing is.  But he's obviously a success.  So it works.  So he shook my hands and said, thank you, great job.  As he was walking up the steps.  So who knows?  Because maybe people bug him after the show and ask for a second.  And who knows what people do after all these years.  So I didn't ask him.  I'm like, if they ever have me back, I certainly will.  But I sent out a MySpace thing.  So I'm going to be on Letterman tonight.  But I didn't get a picture.  So could somebody screen cap me?  Because it's HD now TV.  So I was like, so you could screen cap me and him at the end in a good one. 
[00:45:00]  And send it to me like a large photo.  So I can put it in 8 by 10.  Get the HD version.  Because it was amazing how good you looked on the HD, Jimmy.  So I'll get it.  I mean, I'm not panic-stricken because I know I'll get a really cool one of me and him  on Twitch, the other shaking hand, which is fine.  Yeah.  But it was just really weird, the set there compared to the Tonight Show.  They're just different.  And Letterman's writers were really cool.  The two guys, they're like, I guess, pretty legendary in the business.  The Stangle brothers, Eric and Justin.  And they came up afterwards.  They were really cool.  Yeah, they were really cool.  They were really nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They wanted to get on the show for over a year. 
[00:45:30]  They were very nice dudes.  I'm very glad I did it.  I also get the impression that the staff doesn't really know where he goes right after the  show's over.  Like, he's going back to the offices, but they couldn't follow him if they wanted to.  They don't really know how he gets there.  He just kind of disappears into a hidden wall.  One of the people backstage was like, oh, he's already gone into the catacombs.  Yeah.  They call it the catacombs.  It's like, it's just like this, this like, I just picture Dave with a torch.  Yeah.  Like, he pulls a book on a wall, and the wall spins, and he goes in with a torch. 
[00:46:00]  It's like a maze of hallways and stuff that get to this, like, just, I don't know, I guess  the office space, whatever.  Yeah.  Because he's legendary for the hours he puts in.  He doesn't leave there until really late at night.  I thought he just did the show and, you know, was out of there immediately, but no.  He's involved with probably the whole editing process and everything else, and he doesn't  leave until what?  The show's starting.  I just don't understand how everybody is so afraid of, like, you know, it's almost  like, I would never be hesitant to say, and I guess because you guys are different, but  I never understood people who, like, won't walk up to someone and say, so-and-so who's 
[00:46:30]  on your show wants to take a photo.  It's just bizarre to me.  Ask E-Rock.  Anybody would be right.  How he would feel.  Right.  E-Rock?  Oh, he would ask.  He would ask Opie that somebody wants to take a picture if he knew that Opie's ritual  was to not take pictures.  Um, if the guy was, no, not only would he ask that, but then he'd ask, oh, could he  sign the picture for the charity auction, which no one knows where that money's going  for.  The E-Rock Foundation. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  Yeah, I think he would, because if the guy was a guest on the show, yeah.  Yeah.  I agree.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We went real late with the first break.  Yeah, we'll get back.  When we get back, we'll give you a little taste of Jim Norton on David Letterman last night.  Nice.  Just a taste.  Just a taste.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gunk.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?

This is Paul R. Nelson, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:30]  Bravo.  That is actually Paul R. Nelson.  He is like a huge celebrity in our eyes, man.  Oh, yeah.  This is Paul R. Nelson, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.

[00:50:30]  What a great song.  I can't get enough of that.  Oh, that is a good one.  I can't get enough of that.  How did we get Paul R. Nelson to do an ID for this show, Dan?  Yeah, what happened there?  Well, actually, we have a guy named Paul Anthony to thank in Wisconsin, and stewards of sound.  I guess he was down doing some local radio.  Yeah.  And Paul, being a fan of the show, asked him to do a liner for us, and he did. 
[00:51:00]  Fantastic.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's taken a life of its own.  I love it.  A life of its own here.  Yeah.  Does he know about this program?  He couldn't.  Well, he sent us a lot of goods.  I think he doesn't know about this program, but he would love this program.  I mean, look at the ads he's running.  They are pretty.  Look at the ads he's running.  They are pretty sleazy.  I don't know.  He's a hockey dad.  Yeah, hockey dad, former Marine.  Well, not former Marine. 
[00:51:30]  A Marine.  You're always a Marine.  I don't know if he would enjoy this show.  I don't know either.  But he did send over a bunch of shirts and stickers and everything when we were over at XM.  And by the way, Nathaniel took the best shirt.  The best shirt ever.  We want, and I want one of those black Paul R. Nelson security shirts.  Don't give me the little faggy fan shirt, the white one with the awful red, white, and blue letters.  I want the man shirt that Nathaniel stole.  Nathaniel was wearing it Halloween night.  A lot of people were wearing the Paul R. Nelson shirts at the Halloween party. 
[00:52:00]  How could you resist?  Yeah, and we threw a bunch of them out into the audience.  People were dressed as Paul R. Nelson.  Just terrific.  Let's say hi to Chuck in Wisconsin.  Chuck.  Yeah, this is Jeff.  All right.  What's up, Jen?  Ever.  I'm going to vote for Paul R. Nelson.  All right.  Now, because I live in Wisconsin, and I don't know why.  It's just that I got that name in my head.  Just because he's got the name in his head. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Well.  From this dopey show.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  That's a way to vote.  That's a way to do your research on the candidate.  Hey, his name sounds good in the Funk Soul Brothers song.  Let me vote for him.  Speaking of negative political ads, a couple more came in that have something to do with  the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  This one came in from Joe.  All right.  This is Anthony Cumia, and I approve of this message. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Do I?  Wow.  I didn't get every word that he said.  I heard a couple.  Oh, my God.  That's not right.  But very funny.  Speaking of good old Hitler there. 
[00:53:30]  Good old?  Good old Hitler.  Is that what he's known as, really?  Is enough time gone by?  I would imagine this went national, this kid from where?  Brooklyn?  What's their funny headline there?  Reich and wrong.  Ah, Reich and wrong.  The New York Post.  This was on the front page of the Post.  The high school kid from Brooklyn went to school as Hitler for Halloween.  This funny little Hitler costume joke.  And, yeah, it was on the front page of the Post, I guess, yesterday. 
[00:54:00]  It says Heil-o-ween.  Heil-o-ween.  I get it.  Because Heil Hitler and Heil-o-ween-Hall.  Was the headline.  Hitler kid goose steps back.  See.  Why the word?  Why do these Australians love the word play?  Every headline has to be some kind of a wacky gag.  That's stupid.  Is that Australian humor? 
[00:54:30]  And they're riding.  He's up Auschwitz Creek.  They're riding this story into the ground, by the way.  Today in the New York Post, they show the kid as Davy Crockett, Sherlock Holmes, and Spidey.  Those are some of the other Halloween costumes he did in the past.  This kid, by the way, knew exactly what he was doing.  It's the new culture out there, man.  Every kid out there, especially in high school, knows they can be famous now. 
[00:55:00]  You know, the websites are doing it.  You know, websites like YouTube and Break.com.  All these kids are now aware it's just going to take one little thing and they get instant celebrity.  You can be famous quicker than ever now.  This kid, you can just tell.  I mean, he had a press conference outside the school.  He's completely gone with it.  He knew what he was doing and he knew he would get some publicity out of it.  He had a press conference in the uniform with the swastika armband and everything.  But he didn't go the full look. 
[00:55:30]  What's missing?  The mustache.  His mustache.  Why didn't he wear the Hitler mustache to the thing?  I don't know.  Why should you?  When the Post would just put it on you on the front cover of their newspaper.  Well, maybe the glue wore off.  Is that maybe what happened?  Because I'm thinking he chickened out.  Didn't want to go the distance for the press conference.  Chickened out.  He still has the swastika on his arm.  The armband.  Who doesn't at one point in their life?  No?  Noah's great, though.  You got to give this guy some credit, though. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  He went to school as Charlie Chaplin.  Oh.  That proves to me he knew exactly what he was doing.  He was waiting for his opportunity.  Is that what he did?  Because he knew going into this high school as Hitler, he was going to be stopped at the  front door.  Yep.  You know, the schools aren't stupid.  They're not going to allow some kid to show up as Hitler.  So he showed up as Charlie Chaplin.  He had the hat, the Charlie Chaplin hat.  He had the cane, I guess.  And he had kind of a jacket that was covering his uniform. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  So he went to school and everyone's like, oh, look, Charlie Chaplin, another cute costume.  And then I guess he went into the bathroom and got rid of the hat, the cane, and the jacket  that was covering up the uniform and then started walking around the high school as Hitler.  Wow.  So, yeah, he totally knew.  Totally knew that he would, you know.  You're right.  You're right about that whole they know what they're doing and it's pretty easy to get  famous now.  Everyone thought it was really easy when the reality shows started popping up.  But the odds of getting on those are pretty slim, the audition process and everything. 
[00:57:00]  And that's where everyone thought their 15 minutes was going to come from.  Right.  But now the internet, YouTube, things like that.  You make it.  You put it up.  If it gets some steam, all of a sudden now you've got a name for yourself.  People know who you are.  You're a big celebrity in the internet world.  And then it carries over to some of these TV shows that show internet clips.  Yeah.  So, boom, you're famous.  Break.com is absolutely huge.  You get one video on there that gets some steam and gets a buzz. 
[00:57:30]  Next thing you know, you know, these freaking videos are getting a million views.  Yep.  We did one with Craig the intern, a dumb thing where he spins around.  In a chair, in an office chair.  Well, he had no idea what was going to happen.  Yeah.  He basically said that he could spin around in a chair for a minute and the guys would  spin the chair really fast, one of these office chairs.  Yep.  He said he could last a minute without puke.  And they're like, oh, really?  And he thought everyone was interested in his stupid little challenge.  And they start spinning them, spinning them really fast, really hard. 
[00:58:00]  And about 30 seconds into the spinning of the chair, was it E-Rock?  Oh, Danny.  Danny took one of the kickballs we got from the bully game and just smashed him in the face  as hard as he could throw it.  Right as he came spinning around, his cheek was met with a big, heavy dodgeball, like kickball,  one of those big red balls.  Yeah.  It was a direct hit.  He goes falling off the chair.  Now he wants to get Danny because he's kind of pissed off. 
[00:58:30]  He just got hit in the head with a kickball at point-blank range.  And now because he was spinning for 30 seconds, he's wobbling all over the room and pretty  much falling down.  And this got...  Well, we threw it on break.com and made the front page, and to date, it's like, I don't  know, almost 400,000 hits.  400,000 hits for a silly little video.  And this is happening all the time out there, obviously, with the kids.  Yeah.  You know, they understand.  You make a really good video for YouTube or break.com or some of the other popular sites, 
[00:59:00]  and you're an instant celebrity.  Yeah.  So that mentality is out there, and I just think this kid knew exactly what he was doing.  I'm reading through the story here, though.  The Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee likened the costume to Ku Klux  Klan hood, saying it represents unprotected hate speech.  No, it doesn't.  I don't think it does either.  Believe me, you know, for the rap I take on this program, I think I have a pretty good  idea of what's protected and what's not as far as free speech goes. 
[00:59:30]  He knew this is not an innocent First Amendment advocacy, said the director of the ADL.  He knew this outfit would offend and hurt and maybe even incite by the fact that he didn't  wear it on the subway.  A lot of people don't wear their costumes.  Yeah, so what?  On the transportation that they're taking to whatever event.  I don't think that is...  Because he's afraid of getting his ass kicked on the subway, that doesn't lessen or strengthen 
[01:00:00]  his freedom of speech issue.  It is freedom of speech, and you know it's not going to incite you to get your face punched.  Yeah, right, right, exactly.  But it is protected, and it's not hate speech, so the JDL needs to relax.  It's not ADL, anti-defamation, whatever it is.  Stop it.  Everyone, no, you know what?  If it was a Klan hood, they would have a problem with it, but not as big a problem because  it wasn't a direct defunt on the Jews.  Right.  Everyone has a problem with it when their own people are being attacked.  You could dress like any other tyrannical leader. 
[01:00:30]  Of course you can.  And you won't have a problem with it.  Yeah.  The guy, Hitler, awful guy from history.  He's a historical figure.  If you want to dress like it, yeah, you're going to have to pay the consequences, first  of all.  You're protected, I think, under the First Amendment, but like Jim said, you're not protected  from somebody that just wants to punch you in the face.  But yeah, I can't see how that's any kind of a hate statement.  Absolutely.  He was dressed like Tiberius Caesar. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Would that have been a problem?  Tiberius Caesar, I'm sure, was notorious for molesting kids.  He was a sexual, barbaric individual.  They were all barbaric.  Just like Pol Pot.  Yeah, exactly.  You wouldn't even, no one would know who he was, but.  Well, you know what, man?  I got to say, Forrest Whitaker, in Deep Trouble, he just portrayed Idi Amin.  Idi Amin.  Man, that's got to be some kind of hate.  Wait, oh, it's in the movies?  It's different?  Yeah, it's different.  I don't understand how.  Then if it's a Halloween costume, it's a portrayal.  Why is it different?  Shut up!  Not hate speech, you jackasses. 
[01:01:30]  That movie's getting great reviews, by the way.  I would like to see it.  Yeah.  What is it called?  The King of Scotland?  Yes.  Yeah, it's getting great reviews.  Another great line by Colin.  He said that Flav of Flav was dressed like the King of Scotland, and when Flav was going,  Hey!  Oh!  Hey!  Colin said that was Idi Amin's campaign speech.  He whispered that to me.  That's when nobody else heard it.  He was on fire.  Yeah, he had some great lines, man.  I panicked Rich Voss so bad.  Did that make the broadcast?  I don't even know.  Rich Voss, it did? 
[01:02:00]  Voss was getting all cocky about the haze and the hoes that Flavor Flavor's doing, and  what did Voss say something there?  He was going, A-O-A-O, and he goes, what are those, the only two letters he knows?  In the alphabet.  And Voss says this backstage in the safety of our green room, which was across the hall  from Flavor Flav's green room, which was just completely packed with, like, 70 of his  His posse.  Of his posse.  So I go, oh, Voss, you're so brave.  Let's go over to Flavor Flav's dressing room and see if he enjoyed that line. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  And the panic in Rich Voss's face, because he knew I was going to do it.  No.  No, no, no, no.  No, I earned these teeth.  That was one of the fine highlights from the Halloween show.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, a headline for that story with the kid in a costume.  Kid in Hitler costume burns up Jewish community.  Oh, yeah?  Wasn't that a Jewish school he was at?  Well, I don't know.  He's, uh, apparently he said he was half Jewish. 
[01:03:00]  His family is Jewish.  Or his stepfather.  Some type of tie-in to that.  But that's just making excuses.  The kid's just being a douche.  He is.  He's looking for attention.  He's 16.  And you know what?  He's on the cover of the New York Post.  Everyone gave attention.  There.  I think he's just being a brat.  Who cares?  He won.  You all noticed him.  And you stood outside.  Har-ar-ar-ar-ar.  Har-ar.  Shut up.  Yeah, this was so calculated.  Of course it was.  Yeah.  He played a bunch of adults.  Because it's the whole new attitude out there with, uh, you know, especially the high school 
[01:03:30]  kids, junior high school kids as well.  They're all working on their YouTube videos.  I'm telling you.  That's an attention getter.  This is unprotected hate speech.  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  Yeah, uh, the story I read said that he grew in the Hitler mustache and, uh, went as, uh,  Charlie Chaplin and then changed his school.  And then they made him shave off the mustache.  That's what Opie said.  No, no.  Well, what's different here is that, uh, he actually grew in the mustache.  Oh, it was a real mustache? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  And then the school told him to shave it and that's, uh, why, you know, uh, today's,  uh, piece on.  Oh, he didn't have it.  He doesn't have the mustache.  Oh.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I couldn't grow a mustache back then.  They couldn't make him shave it off.  Uh, John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, what's up?  What about the double standard?  What if it was a black kid going to the Black Panther?  And would it still be in the news as much as he is?  Well, I, I, I, look, I, I, look, as much as I find political correctors reprehensible,  you can't compare a Black Panther to a Hitler dude. 
[01:04:30]  It's a complete, you know, I don't have a,  I think we were different, totally different.  When we're talking about, you know, uh,  Uh, no, I mean, I agree with you in theory, but you can't get, that's a bad comparison.  You should pick another, pick a black dick.  There are plenty of world leaders, uh, uh, tyrants over the years that you could dress up as,  and no one's going to bat an eye at it, even if they've killed millions of people.  Uh, Hitler just sort of has, I guess you'd call it a stigma.  Yeah.  Uh, on him.  Uh, he's like the guy that you just can't dress as or address or anything, which, you know, I don't care. 
[01:05:00]  Obviously, if the kid did it to incite or to offend, uh, that's one thing.  But I think he's doing it purely to grab attention.  Do you understand that the Klan's marches are protected free speech?  Yeah.  Their whole message.  Them actually doing it, not someone dressed as them.  They, they, they, they march and it's protected.  We don't like Jews, blacks or gays.  Kill them all.  That's protected.  That's protected.  And the Anti-Defamation League says this jackass on Halloween is not. 
[01:05:30]  That's dressing as one.  Oh.  Is worse than the actual guys.  Just what?  Douchebag.  Everybody's so, uh, just, oh, I don't know.  We understand.  That's why I dress as a fuzzy, lovable animal everywhere.  How could you lose?  A plushie.  People, they pinch your cheek and give you a candy apple.  They certainly do.  And then they realize I've cut the back of my costume out and they get the old wink, wink message.  As you walk away.  Jim's a plushie.  I'm a plushie.  You're a plushie lover. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Another break.  When we get back, we got to get to the, uh, the appearance on Letterman, Jimmy.  Oh, I don't know.  I want to see a little Jimmy.  We got some, uh, some clips of Jimmy on David Letterman last night.  We're going to get to, I had to read the whack bag post.  Somebody told me he did some of that.  The shower joke.  I let out.  Oh, good imitation.  Yeah.  That's angry.  Uh, angry speaking guy.  I'm a filopity.  He hurt his hand.  Um, and I didn't, I did the couch joke with the face.  Well, she took two totally different bits.  Yeah.  So please.  And I trip over one of the, I'm so annoyed at myself.  Stop. 
[01:06:30]  Don't be annoyed.  You're an angel.  It was fine.  We got, uh, Jim on Letterman after the break.  We got five.  No, let's call it six.  Six new taser clips.  Love the taser.  Can't get enough of the taser, uh, clips.  Those are some of the, the, the most fun videos on YouTube.  Yeah.  Are you plugging who you got in tomorrow too?  Do you know how annoyed I am?  We got Borat coming in tomorrow.  Borat is here tomorrow.  Borat.  And once again, I'll be gone.  No more, uh, Friday gigs from now.  No, I mean, no more Saturday.  From now on, I'm just going to do Friday, Saturday gigs.  I can't miss a guy like that who I love. 
[01:07:00]  Borat's coming in.  Reviews in for that movie are just, uh, great.  I'm so goddamn irritated.  Yeah.  The New York paper is giving it four stars.  And, uh, I go to rottentomatoes.com.  Brother Wee's turned me onto that site, uh, years ago.  It's the best place to go for movie reviews because they take all the reviews from all the  big papers across America and then they give you a nice overall thing.  And this movie is getting 92% good reviews.  That's unbelievable.  People suggesting, uh, Danny should be in the, uh, costume he wore when, uh, Borat comes 
[01:07:30]  in.  I could barely look at him.  I know.  Let's explain that after the break.  Yeah.  Is there pictures of Danny and his Borat costume?  Oh, sure.  Get that on opiananthony.com.  That will get just a ridiculous amount of, uh, hits today.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:08:00]  I'm going to be sick.  Why, sweetie?  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  We got the pictures of, uh, Danny as Borat.  He's wearing the swimsuit.  He's wearing that, uh, yeah, that lime green swimsuit thing where it's just him and that  little piece of material covering his, um, his gear with like, uh, with just, how do you 
[01:08:30]  explain that for, uh, regular radio?  There's a lot of, um, this, the, uh, the sidewalk hadn't been trimmed, edged, the curb, you know,  when you don't edge the curb of your lawn and it grows over the curb.  Wow.  Well, it's a treat for everybody.  That's what he dressed as at the Halloween party this past Tuesday night at the Hard Rock  Cafe.  And you can see this picture where?  On Danny's MySpace? 
[01:09:00]  What is Danny's MySpace?  He certainly didn't get Danny.  It's, uh, MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  Oh, Jim.  Always capitalizing.  Don't you get enough plugs, Jim.  No!  MySpace blocker.  Man, what's Danny's MySpace so everyone can see him as, uh, Borat?  I think it's DannyXM202.  Yeah.  Yep.  DannyXM202.  Okay, very good.  And that's Borat.  I'm, I'm so mad I'm going to miss him tomorrow.  He's in studio.  Did we say that on the air or was it off we were talking about that? 
[01:09:30]  He's in studio tomorrow.  He's in studio tomorrow.  And I'll be in Atlanta having fun at the punchline.  And no matter how much I love you tomorrow, I'm going to want to cut your throats tonight.  Because by seeing you tonight, I'm missing Borat tomorrow, who I love from the Ali G show.  So, anyone that doesn't know that he was in the Ali G show, he, there's three characters.  Ali G, Borat, and who's the gay?  Bruno.  And, uh, he's just hilarious.  I mean, I know he is now, but get the old Ali G's.  There's two seasons of HBO's show.  It's just brilliant.  All right.  Let's, uh, go to the phone and say hi to Clark in Sacramento. 
[01:10:00]  Clark, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hello, Clark.  Clark.  Clark.  Um, hey, this is mostly for Jim.  Great show last night on Letterman.  Thank you.  And, uh, question, are you still coming to Sacramento?  Yeah, I pushed that until the end of January, but I will be there.  Because I'm, uh, doing a Bob Saget show in Vegas, uh, the old Sacramento week.  Ooh.  But thank you, sir.  I will be there.  All right.  Let's say hi to Justin on Long Island.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I'm trying to get in touch with the boy in studio, voted Swedish Smile. 
[01:10:30]  I voted the Wilkins boy was supposed to win that year, but then that mysterious fire started  in his room and he didn't win anything.  He won.  Boy, most likely to cry at the sight of a lemon.  That could sting.  Oh, man.  Jim, I just want to tell you, man, we were up and about for you at the show.  You were looking like a million bucks.  No homo, bro.  You looked phenomenal.  Oh, thank you.  By the way, thank you to Angela and Joseph Abood.  The same guys that dressed Opie and Anthony, uh, dressed me.  And because you guys look good.  I, I, I believe me, there was a great look you guys had. 
[01:11:00]  And I'm, I'm like, uh, I went there and they took very good care of me.  She even took me to Bloomingdale's cause they didn't have my size.  And it was Joseph Abood showed me they had my size and she took me there and they actually  Joseph Abood bought it from me at Bloomingdale's.  Not the guy himself.  I don't know if it's a livery.  It could be 200 and dead, but the clothes were from them.  And then thank you.  All right.  Very good.  That looked great.  Oh, shoot.  Is he still there?  Maybe I, are you still there, bro?  Eh, screw him.  He had something else.  Sorry about that.  Here's Jim Norton on Letterman last night.  Just a little taste.  From New York, the greatest. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, this is always fun to hear though.  The late show with David Letterman.  Tonight from CSI New York, Gary Solis, Joe Ed Carson, and comedian.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Bob Schaefer.  And the CBS Orchestra.  And now, president of the Rachel Ray winning club, Dave. 
[01:12:00]  David Letterman.  That's pretty cool.  And by the way, the plug, people ask me, why did you mention Opie and Anthony in the plug?  Here was my intro, which I was going to say.  You can hear him five days a week on the Opie and Anthony.  And Anthony show.  And this November 10th will be appearing at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  I had to plug that.  Only allowed one plug.  Why is that?  No idea.  That was the rule.  And they got back to me.  Yeah.  And so they tried to even, but we couldn't. 
[01:12:30]  And I had to plug the day because I had to get.  That's why you do the show.  You don't have to explain it, Jimmy.  But it was just annoying that.  It was like, come on, man.  It's a CBS thing too.  Oh, and they were just on the show.  You guys, come on.  You could just say from the Opie and Anthony show, Jim Norton.  There was a way to do it where it wouldn't be.  It would only be another second.  A second and a half maybe.  Well, that's hard.  That's a second and a half.  I got to tell you, Gary Sinise was just god awful.  Was he?  He's this huge actor, as we all know.  And he was such a bore.  Really?  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:00]  Someone has to say it.  I don't know what they ended up using because it looked like even David was like, oh, I  got to make something out of this.  Oh.  I don't know what it was.  And then in the middle of his interview, he's like rubbing his ear obsessively really  hard.  I think I've seen him do that before.  You have seen him do that?  Oh, yeah, because I think I've seen him on Leno, and yeah, he kept rubbing his ear or  doing something.  It might be some nervous thing.  I'm sure it is.  Maybe he just doesn't like doing talk shows.  And then Joanne Carson, who was on the show with you, she was a babbling ass. 
[01:13:30]  Someone has to say, freaking Jimmy saved the show last night.  I'm telling you.  You know, obviously, Letterman or, you know, we know for a fact, too, you're not going to  have a good show every day or every night in Letterman's case.  Just want a good average.  But Gary Sinise didn't give him anything.  He looked nervous just to be, you know, on that couch with Letterman.  No energy whatsoever.  Rubbing his ear like crazy.  What was Joanna Carson doing?  Oh, just babbling and babbling.  About Johnny?  Babbling.  Yeah, but she's there plugging some Sherman Capote stuff. 
[01:14:00]  She's raffling off.  And Letterman, I watched Letterman, and because Sinise was not a great interview.  I mean, the bottom line, he's-  It had nothing to do with Letterman, by the way.  No, no, not at all.  Because, like, Letterman was, like, leading him down the path, holding his hand.  But it was weird.  Gary Sinise was, like, looked uncomfortable in his own skin.  A lot of actors.  And he's an amazing actor.  A lot of actors, man.  That's why they don't do talk shows.  You never see De Niro, Pacino, Nicholson, so many.  Keitel.  They just, A, they don't want their real personalities shown because they like to be who they are.  But a lot of these guys are painfully shy. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, they really, they're just, they're horribly shy.  And they're just not good in situations like that.  But if you think Sinise's script-  Wow.  Being themselves.  Yeah, they can't be themselves.  On that stage in a script, he could do anything.  He could probably walk out naked and do Shakespeare without, you know, or could I pick a worse example?  But you understand what I mean.  I'm picturing that.  Yeah.  But a lot of these guys are really shy, so they're not great interviews.  But Letterman, I kind of watched his interviewing skills, and he is a good interviewer, man.  Like, he just, he made the most out of that that you could have.  He laughed in the right places. 
[01:15:00]  He kind of, you know, I guess that's what you have to do to have a talk show.  Why am I staying in the obvious?  Oh, yeah.  You know, I was good.  He sat in front of the desk.  He didn't fall over.  He was able to, you know, talk.  I'm an ass.  To talk show.  I just talk sometimes, and I wonder, what are you saying?  We all do that.  Oh, my God.  I'm a blithering idiot.  The worst when you say, I'm a blithering idiot, you say blithering.  Blithering.  No.  I stopped myself.  I knew I had a second shot at it.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  People think I'm an expert on this topic. 
[01:15:30]  I don't know.  Crap.  Just make it up as you go along, and hopefully they'll just nod their heads out there.  It sounded good right up until that point.  Now I'm babbling.  All right.  Here's some more Jim Norton on Letterman.  Our next guest is a very funny gentleman, and as a matter of fact, on November 10th,  he will be headlining at the Hammerstein Ballroom as part of the New York Comedy Festival.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's Jim Norton.  Jim.  I'm clapping.  I'm clapping.  How cool is that? 
[01:16:00]  Black Sabbath music.  Thank you.  Thanks, everybody.  How are you?  Good.  Good.  I actually, I'm really feeling good.  I'm embarking on a new relationship, which is kind of nice.  But you ever do something to bond with somebody, and it feels right, but when you look back  on it, you kind of feel like a creep?  Like you're in the car, and a song comes on, so you turn the volume way up, and you go,  listen to the words. 
[01:16:30]  Like she's going to hear the song lyrics and kind of identify them with you and learn something.  Like, hey, I never knew you had the eye of the tiger.  Hey, was that Paul Schaefer going, ah?  There was one, the thing I thought.  Paul Schaefer was enjoying your set.  There was one thing I think I heard him laughing at, like specifically, and I think it was,  I want to say something to do with the racial material.  I don't remember. 
[01:17:00]  By the way, right after this, I made a quick edit, and I'm so, you know how we obsess over  the imperfections, and I tripped on the setup for the GPS joke, and it was like, here's  why, because I had made a quick edit in my head on the fly, and I was just like, you're  running through, like, is that going to second anything later?  Yeah, but you really think, like, can I tie that in with anything?  You have to, you're like, your head's just doing that, so that's why I was preoccupied  in the setup of this next joke, which is why I can, you know, maybe people didn't notice,  but I certainly did.  Now we all will.  No, no, that's right, you should.  It was a flub.  Nothing horrible.  More from Jim Norton on Letterman. 
[01:17:30]  It's interesting, it's interesting as a white comedian, sometimes when you say the word race,  how there was always a few white people.  Huh?  Oh, did they get through the GPS line?  I don't know, we were just getting some highlights for you, Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  We're going to play the whole set over at XM, and then the CBS people will call us and  say, stop, don't do that.  Please don't do that.  But we'll do it, so we'll do the whole set on XM today.  It's interesting, it's interesting as a white comedian, sometimes when you say the word race,  how there was always a few white people in the audience that are like, oh, we're not  with him, not sure where he's going with this. 
[01:18:00]  Yet if a black comedian mentions race, the same white people are like, oh, hon, this is going  to be a doozy.  Wonder what we did now.  We are guilty of that.  White people have a very odd guilt complex.  We really do, man.  We really feel bad all the time, and we don't have to.  Most of us don't have to.  All right, look, if you're over 65 and you live in Alabama, okay. 
[01:18:30]  Chances are you owe a few apologies.  By the way, my friend, that is a great line.  That is a great line.  A ballsy joke, too, for a talk show.  Yeah.  I'm just ballsy.  It's pretty ballsy, dude.  You could have gone with all pretty safe stuff.  Yeah, there was some edgy.  You get racial material. 
[01:19:00]  If you're a white guy and you do racial material like that, especially when it's black-white,  that's a ballsy move.  I give you credit, my friend.  And he wasn't getting the...  And he pulled it off.  He wasn't getting the, uh, from the audience.  He was getting big laughs.  Yeah, yeah.  They were nice.  Jimmy's uncomfortable.  Why?  Do that at the Apollo.  Why are you uncomfortable?  I'm annoyed that the CBS lawyers would have a problem with playing that.  I'm real...  Oh, no, I just kind of threw that out there.  I think it would be...  I just threw it out there.  No, I think it would be really funny if we went over to Satellite, to XM.  and played it and received a cease and desist from our own company. 
[01:19:30]  I just kind of threw it out there, Jimmy.  I don't know for sure.  I think that would be really hysterical.  I'm all about creating controversy.  I didn't mean to bum you out.  I really don't know.  When you read the newspapers, controversial shock jock, Hopi and Anthony, he's the Opie part.  It's controversial.  I really don't know for sure, Jim.  All right, uh, here's another highlight from last night's Letterman.  Appearance.  Appearance.  Another line of thinking I never understood is homophobia.  I don't understand people who don't like gay people. 
[01:20:00]  Um, and I'm not gay.  I'm not.  I don't think it's fair to judge a person by a few dozen incidents.  I mean, it's late.  I'm in a rest area.  Someone goes, what, am I going to be rude?  I'm amazed.  I got to tell you.  Damn.  I'm amazed Letterman, like, approved this entire set. 
[01:20:30]  Because it's so edgy.  Well, none of it was, uh, FCC violation.  None of it was even, it was all in you, I mean, none of it was, like, you know, FCC, psst.  I mean, I'm sorry, like, you know, rest area, psst.  None of it.  Yeah.  It's so, it's, the idea behind it is so dirty.  Yeah.  But the way it's presented is, it's squeaky clean.  And this is actually, this is honestly, God, the material's not that edgy at all.  It's, it's, it literally, it's just that most comics on TV is so milquetoast.  Yeah.  That anything that's not even, that's not milquetoast appears. 
[01:21:00]  That's what I'm trying to do.  Yeah, as far as Letterman and comics go, this is very edgy.  Yeah, for, for TV, I guess, but.  For Letterman.  Yeah.  Especially.  And finally, uh, one more here before we take a break.  Colin Quinn's here.  He's going to join the program in a few minutes.  And we got your Borat, uh, song.  Oh.  I have a, uh, gay friend helping me decorate my apartment, which I know is stereotypical.  But look, I talk to my straight friends.  They're just worthless.  And we had an odd moment.  We were in a furniture store and my friend sees a very good looking blonde haired guy. 
[01:21:30]  And he tells me the guy's name and he goes, uh, we used to work out at the same gym.  I had him in the shower.  And I really wished he wasn't comfortable enough with me to blurt that out.  Yet I still found myself going, what happened?  Thank you guys very much.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Uh.  All right.  I didn't think Letterman liked me, to be honest with you. 
[01:22:00]  Why?  Just a vibe.  Really?  Yeah, man.  How could he tell that?  I don't know.  You just know.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  You felt that?  Mm-hmm.  When he walked over?  You just, you just, you just feel it.  Wow.  He was polite.  He wasn't, you just, you know.  It's like walking into a room and you get like that weird danger sense.  You just, you little weird things.  I would think.  Like, he probably could give two craps about you.  No, but, yeah, but in the sense, like, I, yeah, I guess I, I think that's what I felt. 
[01:22:30]  It's like, okay, he's been through this a thousand, I don't even, more than a thousand.  I don't know how many times he's brought guests out and up.  I don't even think he can make a decision unless they've done the show ten times.  Yeah.  It's just another guy.  All right, whatever you are.  And maybe you're right.  Maybe it's like.  He forgets about you as soon as you leave.  Like, in a split second in his head, he's like, ah, this guy's all right, or, ah, this  guy's not quite all right. 
[01:23:00]  But I don't think there's this real big swing with him with, wow, I really like this guy,  or, oh, I don't like this guy.  I think he's just like, all right, what time is it?  Time to go into the catacombs.  I'm out.  And how could anyone not love you, Jimmy?  Just a vibe.  Did you smile at him?  I said hi when I walked out, yeah.  No, a smile, because if you smiled at him, there's no way he could resist, because you  were voted, boy with, what were you voted?  Well, what year are you talking about? 
[01:23:30]  Boy who's, boy most likely to brighten your day with a smile.  Yes.  And boy with the sweetest smile in the neighborhood.  In the neighborhood.  After that Wilkins boy had his accident.  All right, we're going to have a break.  Police said they found an accelerant in the room.  They did.  Still looking at that one.  We're going to take a break, and Colin Quinn will join the program next.  We've got some taser clips to get to.  I want to hear those.  We also have, actually, yeah, we should go with the view thing today. 
[01:24:00]  They had a discussion about the Kerry.  I don't know, I'm looking at a political ad where they have a dramatization of a national  security tape.  Oh, but it just looked really bad.  That's 9-11 footage, right?  It's some kind of 9-11 tie-in.  Great.  Yeek.  All right, we'll get Colin Quinn on the program next.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.

[01:25:00]  Our friend just got out of the shower across the way, so.  Oh, no, she just got off the exercise bike, so she's going to the shower, right?  So she's going to be very naked very soon, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  She does the bike and then the headstand for some reason.  And then she takes her clothes off.  She might want to bust up a few notches on that bike.  Yeah, we've suggested that.  There's a reason for the headstand, too.  Yeah.  That gravity's a bitch.  Gravity.  She's trying to.  She's trying to turn it around a little bit.  Well, she's not going to do it. 
[01:25:30]  She stands.  She stands for, like, all day at work.  Five minutes upside down isn't going to bring everything back where it was.  Well, it's fun to watch.  Yeah.  She's on her head for, like, five minutes.  Naked.  Half the time.  Quite the treat.  All right.  Colin Quinn in studio.  Hi, everybody.  What fun we had at the Halloween party.  Oh, we had a blow.  First, let me just say, Jim Norton, brilliant.  And really, what you guys said, doing that kind of material, you know, it's not easy.  And it was really great to see somebody. 
[01:26:00]  You said it was a man set.  It was a man set.  And I can't.  I didn't vouch for the outfit.  What was wrong with the outfit?  The fact that it was an outfit.  That he was so proud.  You could see him getting out of the cab or the car, trying not to wrinkle himself.  All dressed up with mummy.  Oh, you'd be disgusted.  I actually brought it in a separate over-the-shoulder bag.  It was a back-to-school outfit.  Could you steam this, please?  It was a great set. 
[01:26:30]  Thank you.  Oh, but, yeah, that was some following party.  I think.  Well, what did you say about Letterman, though, too?  Oh, I was saying that Letterman definitely, Anthony nailed it.  He could care less about anybody.  I was in there once a couple of years ago.  And for some reason, I made him laugh.  I said it was sarcastic on the air.  Afterwards, the producer go, Letterman really liked you.  He liked you.  And I go, great.  Well, you know, I live two blocks away from the show.  So if you have a fallout call.  Oh, you really?  You could do.  Hey, guys, sure.  I'll just picture myself being like the new Tony Randall 
[01:27:00]  and getting all these free $600 paychecks and nailing.  Just getting the phone call.  That was three years ago.  They've never called me once.  And you live right there.  Not once.  Not once.  The school says you've been there.  Yeah, in case someone cancels, they can call Colin Quinn.  He would be there like that.  Like that.  I had an old plan out in my head.  Never call once, though.  Now, Jim's like, what does it have to do with me?  No, I know exactly what it has to do with me.  No matter how good you think you do, he just forgets you before he's up those steps. 
[01:27:30]  Either way, yeah.  Yeah, I think it's just another show under his belt.  But someone in his position, what is it going to take for him to remember you?  Because he's seen it all.  Like to do ten appearances, to be that person that keeps coming back on the show time and time again.  Then he'll know who you are.  And even then, it doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't matter.  Even on the breaks, he just sits there and looks out numbly at the audience.  In the scheme of things, it doesn't matter.  He's Dave.  He's done this for years.  He's got his way of doing it, and that's it. 
[01:28:00]  Well, you know...  Are you going to fault the man?  You're going to fault the man?  Don't screw up our December appearance.  I am going to fault him.  You're going to fault him?  He's a genius.  He's been on the air doing this for how many years?  Come on.  Longer than all of them put together.  Park, Carson, right?  No, I don't know about that.  Of course not, but I'll say that.  What's he, 20 years, though?  Over 20 years?  Who cares?  What do you think?  I follow his damn career.  Let's move on.  I don't know.  You might know.  I want to talk about the party Tuesday.  Oh, you do?  Mama Mia.  I left about probably 10 minutes before Flav and them. 
[01:28:30]  I knew they weren't going to wrap it up.  Yeah.  You were on the stage for part of the Flav.  If Colin left in the middle of that whole thing with Flav, you just finally were like, what  am I doing here?  He's an old salt.  He knew exactly what it was.  What am I doing here?  I was there when they started.  Yeah.  Flavor Flavor and Chuck D. When Chuck D weighed under 280.  And I walked to the front.  And as I was walking in, meanwhile, they checked me for like six laminates when I came in.  They're like, look, this is what we have to do.  I was like, I understand.  Six laminates.  They go backstage.  They had to take that. 
[01:29:00]  Kenny had to come get me.  They had to do it.  Yeah, they had to do it, DNA tags.  Bunch of crap.  I was leaving the same girl sitting at that door looking anywhere but to right where she  was standing as like, you know, 50 thugs came rolling in.  Yep.  And I was like, boy, I'm leaving right before the Superdome.  They came rolling in.  Are we discussing?  Did you check their laminates?  No.  No.  No.  You didn't even look near them.  Laminates, indeed.  They was rolling 20 deep up in there.  We talked about earlier, Flavor Flav hijacked our Halloween show. 
[01:29:30]  He was on that stage for 55 minutes.  He was supposed to do five, maybe 10.  I think that Flavor Flav was understandable because he is the big name right now, but I  think from now on, your audience and hip-hop should not be...  Never the twain shall meet.  Yeah, you know, they...  Was I the only one on the edge of my seat just waiting for some awful thing to happen?  I was waiting for maybe an audience chant that involved an N, a pairing of a couple of 
[01:30:00]  consonants, and then maybe an R at the end.  It really was.  The Green Room was like one of those Johnson Family Reunion movies.  Uncle Nate, he passes gas at the family barbecue.  It was just...  It didn't stop.  No.  And now I want to bring up...  I want to introduce...  Oh, what now?  He's got his whole family up there.  And like you said, it just doesn't stop, and we can leave it at that.  No.  The whole family.  No.  The whole family. 
[01:30:30]  That's the thing, I guess, as far as, you know, economically speaking.  Yeah.  Where does the family stop?  Ha, ha, ha.  I don't want to say they're a ghetto, but the kids had bling holders.  We'll be talking about this one for years.  Ooh.  The Green Room was painted purple.  I'm talking about a ghetto situation.  I knew there was going to be...  How about you?  I knew there was going to be problems, because there were just too many in his posse.  No, there was.  Really?  There was a couple of incidents where one of our fans, her sister, got a pocketbook taken 
[01:31:00]  right off her arm, as the gentleman laughed at her.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  As one of the gentlemen laughed at her.  Inside or outside?  Either...  Inside, I'm sure.  Yeah, I think it was just inside the door.  I'm not sure of all the details.  There was cops right outside.  I'm talking to my ass again.  Why didn't you tell the cops?  I believe a cop was told.  First, security inside the place was told, and they did nothing.  And then a cop was told, and by that point, what are you going to do? 
[01:31:30]  Was the guy gone?  Yeah, he was gone.  There were witnesses, though?  Yeah, this happened.  This happened.  I just find it hard to believe that.  There was a lot of groping, a lot of grabbing by the posse.  That's exactly...  I'm telling you, as I was coming back...  They just love doing that.  It's unbelievable.  They love doing that.  I don't know why.  What is it?  We all know why.  I believe Jim was...  I believe Jim was introducing the issue on Letterman last night.  Why?  That's messed up. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, it just got one...  It was one of those things where, yeah, two worlds met that should never have met.  Yeah.  Cigars and Scotch has a good question.  Cigars and Scotch, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Great show.  The thing that everyone was wondering in the crowd was, were they wandered like we were  when they came in?  And was there the same security scrutiny that we went through to get indoors?  I'm sure.  I think the wands were there because of them, yeah.  I just said no.  They weren't wandered though.  When I was leaving, literally, the girl at the door that gave me high scrutiny, the legend, 
[01:32:30]  by the way, and I still took it because I'm humble, and people were, I mean, like 40 guys,  and I said to this couple that was leaving, actually it was the girl and her boyfriend  that came in second in the dunking contest, and she was very upset, but, you know, she  understood, but I said, hey, looks like we left just before the fall of, and shit, and  they're like, yeah, yeah.  The fall of?  Yeah.  All right.  And Club Sorted, Kenny had his hands full.  He had that look on his face like when he was a rookie patrolman and he had to work  Ashton Simpson. 
[01:33:00]  His sergeant made a prank on him.  He said, no, you worked a side door here.  He was like, ah, I'm all alone.  Yeah, Kenny was.  He's on fucking Boulevard.  Kenny was uber stressed at that point.  The magnetometers are like standard operating procedure for us, and we didn't discriminate.  Everybody allegedly was supposed to be wandered coming in and walk through that metal detector.  All right.  And I want to thank that guy for dressing like me. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Gonzo, Long Island, what's up?  How you doing, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, great show, great show.  Listen, at the ONA show, me and my girl are trying to get a picture with Flavor Flav.  So he's at the back, and he's trying to get up there and go to the corner.  And we got in there, and we're like, can we get a picture with Flav?  And they're fucking fucked up.  Hey.  Oh, hey.  Oh.  They're going to interrupt your story. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God, hold on.  Because they dumped out.  So you were trying to get a picture with Flavor Flav.  We're up to that point.  Go ahead.  So we want to get a picture of Flavor Flav.  And we're up there, and the bodyguard, no joke, goes, I'm sorry, your girl's too white.  I'm like, you got to be freaking kidding me, man.  Too white to take a picture with him?  To take a picture with Flavor Flav.  I'm like, ah, dude, you got it.  Ah, I'm sure he was joking.  Once again.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't know if, I think this guy's on to something, because my girl tried to get a picture with Flavor Flav, 
[01:34:30]  and she was denied.  Maybe they're just talking about logistics, like the camera can't handle the contrast,  and they just know.  Just blows up camera.  Who denied Lindsay a picture with Flav?  Flav did.  He said no?  Yeah.  But all I'm telling you is, if that, whether it was a joke or not, if that had been the other way around.  Of course.  It would be on the front page of Newsweek.  Of course.  Of course.  Exactly.  There was Axl Rose, bah, bah, bah.  Back in the day, they'd call him up.  Of course.  That sickens me.  Dude, your chick was denied a picture. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Sir, if it's any consolation, I'll take a picture with your girlfriend.  She's not too white for me.  No, I'm just kidding.  So that guy might be onto something with that.  Yes, Kenny.  Well, Flav himself said no to her, or the guy's...  Shut up.  We just said Flav himself.  I believe it was Flav himself.  Now you're all balls to the wall.  Now you're like, wait a minute, let's not jump talking.  I mean, William Drayton Jr. would never...  Yes, he said Flav, denied Lindsay, and this guy got denied by the bodyguard.  Pay attention, boy.  Pay attention.  I tried to get Lindsay the picture, and they just blew her right off. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Who'd you just want?  Wow.  Flav and the bodyguard.  Yeah.  You said it's Ulf's girlfriend?  Yeah, I said it.  He didn't know who...  First of all, Flav or Flav?  He didn't know who...  I would love to sit here and be cocky.  Like, we're so popular that Flav knows who we are.  Flav did our show and had no idea who we were on Tuesday night.  Without being throwback about it, you let your beautiful girlfriend take a picture with  that on him?  You tell her, don't go near. 
[01:36:00]  I don't want to show my kiss and that King Cole over here, Kenny.  I'm just saying, he has this reality show.  We know, we know, we get it, the reality show, but let's just leave it.  What the Frank Vincent scene from Jungle Fever when she walks in the door.  Oh, how great is that?  You took a picture.  I erased her.  Hey, Paul in Cleveland, what's up?  Hey, during the costume contest, I could hear some girl like three, four times in a row just  screaming, stop touching my ass. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, God.  Great.  That's what you want.  Punch it out, fella.  All right.  Let's go to Mastic and say hi to Bobby.  Bobby.  Uh-oh.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Bobby.  Great show.  Great show.  I was actually in the upper left corner where Flay was taking his pictures.  Yeah.  And I got up to get a bud and the guy, that HNIC, I'll call him, told me, you got to sit  back down.  His whole, his posse leader, whatever you want to call him. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, he was a badass.  Hey, I'm not going to lie to you guys.  I'm amazed we didn't have a major incident at that part.  Because like I think Colin said, there was two worlds colliding.  Yeah, but there were definitely, the white people outnumbered him.  Yeah, but the white people were more scared.  They outnumbered him in fear, too, the white people.  And yeah, by the time it started ending, the crowd.  There were some hardcore white guys there.  I saw some guys that looked like they didn't back down for much, let's be honest.  Yeah.  Your audience has a few hardcore fans. 
[01:37:30]  A few of them.  I'm telling you, I saw them.  It just would have been one of those pandemonium race riots that I really think would have gotten  us some really good press.  And they would have rolled in 042.  That's what they were coming from when I left.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had one guy up front, a big white dude, he had a camera.  It was so funny.  He was trying to take pictures.  The camera was like a little, it was like a diamond in his hand.  He was so big as mitts.  He looked like he liked to go.  Big set of mitts on him.  He liked to go.  Yeah, he probably wanted to go.  Did you have a good time, Colin?  I did have a good time.  Any other observations from the Halloween show?  What made me laugh the most was when you started, not only did you call out poor voice, 
[01:38:00]  but then you would, the look on Opie's face of disgust for like five minutes.  You were really, you were ready to fight.  I didn't realize Opie's kind of a psycho.  He was like, oh, you're just learning that?  Yeah.  But just the look on your face towards Voss.  And Voss was like, no, Voss had true fear in his eyes because he really thought I was  going to go across the hall.  You would have.  Well, you never know.  You would have for radio.  I know you would.  Let's just put it that way.  You never know.  He was pulling Voss.  It was only eight feet away.  Well, he kind of said it a little earlier, but Voss got all cocky in the green room, 
[01:38:30]  you know, in the safety of our white green room, doing Flavor Flav jokes about the ahs  and the oohs that Flav was doing on the stage saying that's all he knows from the alphabet.  I go, let's go across the hall and tell Flav what you just said.  No, stop.  And the pure panic in his eyes made me chuckle.  The whole thing.  See, here's the thing about Opie that I realized.  He doesn't like.  That's another reason you can't have these rappers on.  First of all, there's been 40 people everywhere.  Yeah.  It's really obnoxious.  I was there when all this started, not to be an old man about it. 
[01:39:00]  MTV in the late 80s are like, you know, the Beatles want an extra guest for their sick  son.  And then, you know, like, cool Moe D needs 132.  And then just give it to them.  Instead of going, no.  So that's how it's all started.  And then clubs did it with a, but Opie hates disorganization.  And that's why he was going to do it.  Because he didn't care if we all died.  He was just like, this is not a controlled environment.  This will bring this to an end.  And here's why it wasn't a total abomination the whole scene.  Because Flav is in his 50s, I think.  Yeah.  And even his bodyguards are older guys. 
[01:39:30]  Yo.  They're older dudes.  If it was like a younger.  That one bodyguard was violence personified.  Yes.  But they weren't.  They weren't.  Sonny Liston.  That guy wanted a problem.  That young black dude was like saying something to Flav, like heckled him.  Yeah.  And the bodyguard looked at the young black dude like this.  Literally for 40.  He melted the guy.  Here's the difference.  Melted him.  Club Soda Kenny is amazing with security.  Absolutely.  But he doesn't want any problems.  No.  Flav or Flav's guy is there because he wants a problem. 
[01:40:00]  That's the difference.  That guy, yeah.  And one guy to our left.  Right?  Well, they're hoping for some kind of shooting because that's what makes the news and it makes  the guy more popular.  It sells records.  They were older guys.  And a lot of his people were older.  No.  A lot of his people on stage.  We're not talking about the stage people.  We're talking about the posse backstage.  We're talking about coming in.  And when I was leaving, I saw people streaming in from 42nd Street.  They must have heard Flavor was there.  Yeah.  And I'm telling you, it was so funny because I came in, and we all know the legend is quite 
[01:40:30]  well known.  I had to wait for like six laminates.  I had to call Kenny.  I had to call Poe.  If I hadn't seen Poe at the bar, I had to like rap.  They're like, look, this is how we have to do it.  I was like, I understand.  Yeah, all that.  They streamed in.  This girl was looking like this.  I go, what about them?  Oh, yeah.  What about them?  You look at me like, whoa.  You know what about them.  Look.  Yeah.  And then they said, what are you talking about?  I was like, oh, yeah, no.  What about you guys getting a free drink?  Ha, ha, ha.  No.  Why does that have to be a 50-person posse?  What is that?  But it's true.  The posse was kind of like the family reunion with the T-shirts. 
[01:41:00]  What's Tom?  Uh-oh.  Tom?  Oh, Tom, yes.  I think you're missing one of the key points.  I don't like to come in, but one of the key points in that, when Flav was on the stage  and the crowds, and he introduces his two daughters.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  The crowds started.  That's where it could have got ugly.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  Show us your...  Yeah.  Yeah, your...  And all of a sudden, he turned around and looked at the crowd, walked right up to the  edge of the stage and said, what do you say?  And that crowd went about as silent, as quickly as possible. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Oh, nothing.  Yeah.  No, that was...  Nothing.  I honestly was backstage.  I heard that went on.  I was there when that happened.  And then Flav...  No, no, wait.  The whole crowd stopped immediately?  Oh, absolutely.  Wow.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And then Flav goes, oh, man, I got my mom here.  Could you just wait until I get my mom off the stage?  By the way...  And he had his mother take it off the stage, because they're all like, show your...  Yeah.  Asking for a pie.  And meanwhile, if it was anybody else that said, I got my mother on the stage, they'd  have started the chant for the mother, too.  Really?  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  All I'm saying is, it's hard to take a lesson from Tom when he's wearing a tie like 
[01:42:00]  Flavor's Uncle Earl.  There's a fine shade of green.  That tie came from the Superfly Boutique in Freeport.  You're going to try to fight back, are you nuts?  Absolutely.  John Minnelli says, hey, you know, Colin, well, we're going to talk about maybe doing  a show.  And he says, I'd love to do a show, love to do a show, but, you know, Nick drives me  crazy, yada, yada, yada.  Then later, he says, you know, if I do the show with Nick, I'll die. 
[01:42:30]  If I do the show without Nick, I'll die.  I said, well, Colin, that's a conundrum.  How do you do a show?  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  No, I told him the truth, because John Minnelli, you know?  Yeah.  He came in and...  He's the new PD here in New York.  New PD here.  Yeah.  So they're like, I'm like, yeah, I'll talk about doing a show.  And I was like, I can't do a show, because I do it without Nick.  Me and Nick tried to do it together.  It didn't work out.  I said, if I try to go in without Nick, and he finds out, he'll kill me.  I'm like, well, you do it with him or without him?  He's still screwed, huh?  I go, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Tom really put it into place.  Exactly.  Right.  I didn't like that slam on Tom's tie, either, by the way.  Yeah, that was not nice.  Oh, come on.  It's a good look.  It takes a brave man to wear a tie like that.  Absolutely.  It really does.  You know, Shasta, stop making that flavor.  Shasta.  Shasta.  I sort of went with lifesavers myself.  A brave man to say, I don't care what people think of my sexuality.  I'm just putting this around my neck.  If it was a hog tied around his neck, he couldn't look more gay.  So who walked to the front of this?  Hey, we missed that girl.  Who walked to the front of the stage when the daughters were getting the chance? 
[01:43:30]  Flav did.  Flav himself.  Yeah, I didn't know he said that.  It sounded to me like he just goes, my mother's here, everybody.  He did say that.  He wasn't saying it.  No one was scared of it.  He said he's a 50-year-old guy in a gold crown.  They were kind of like, have it your way on the side.  He is Flav a Flav.  He was backed up, though, by his peeps.  I think Posse was family.  I'm telling you, the people come and stream it in.  I'm glad we all, including our listeners, get out of their life.  Yeah.  I was amazed.  That was good.  Another close shave for the white man. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  Hey, you guys hear what happened on ESPN?  No.  What's the story?  It's just coming in, actually.  Someone got in trouble for saying something.  Oh, here it is.  I got it.  Former NFL tight end Brian Kitchen will not work as an ESPN commentator this week  because of a comment he made during last Saturday's broadcast of the Northern Illinois-Iowa game.  Kitchen was explaining the need for receivers to make catches with their hands  because they are tender and can caress the ball.  He then paused and said, that's kind of gay, but hey, the comments were inappropriate 
[01:44:30]  and we apologize for them, said ESPN's vice president of public relations, Josh, blah, blah.  Hey, Josh, let me interrupt you all because, Josh, I understand that ESPN, you have to be somewhat sensitive,  but your core audience is not gay.  But not only that, this is the fall.  This is why the West is falling.  This kind of stuff.  You understand me?  Political, correct, everyone's got to be coddled and petted. 
[01:45:00]  But except for anybody who could come in from any place else and say anything,  everybody's like, well, you know, that's just a mistake.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  We've all been saying kind of gay our entire lives,  and I think even in the gay community they say that's kind of gay.  They would not care about that.  The world is falling apart because of this kind of stuff.  This is where the West is falling.  I just swear.  The comments were inappropriate.  Kitchen's future with ESPNU is under review.  ESPN's decision first was reported in blah, blah, blah.  Kitchen, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  You know, there are two distinct.  I'm sorry, real fast, Dan.  They were completely inappropriate and not at all a reflection of who I am  or the way I perform my work.  See, now he has to grovel.  This is Kitchen saying this.  It is who you are because we all are like that.  You make jokes.  You use that word.  There are two distinct different uses for the word gay, fag, things like that.  And both of them are fine compared to what goes on in the world.  Yeah, exactly.  Why can't you say – like you walk into some place and you see your friend 
[01:46:00]  just bought a new couch, and you go, that is the gayest couch I've ever seen.  Are you talking about Jim's thing from last night?  Actually, I'm talking about Jim's thing.  Do you have a gay couch?  No, I have a very comfy couch.  But we do a gay guy.  Excuse me.  Every girl that's all – and you know the gay guy.  He won't say his name on the air, but that's a completely true story happening.  He eludes himself that he's not considered gay.  Oh, no.  He knows.  He's coming out very slow.  Robert Kelly?  Oh, no.  Oh.  Sorry.  He has morbid gay-bicity.  Yeah, but, yeah, I mean, you've used it your whole life. 
[01:46:30]  Come on.  You want to go out tonight?  Nah, I'm going to hang out.  Dude, don't be a faggot.  Come out.  It doesn't mean don't stay home and have sex with men.  It means don't just hang out.  Don't be a faggot.  Right.  But we have a hard time – because, you know, Anthony's from one of these, like, hap hog,  white trash towns.  Oh.  Huntington, sir.  Yeah.  He's proud.  Meanwhile, he's the guy that dressed that kid for Halloween and went to open Anthony's  outfit.  That's right.  I had that one in my closet. 
[01:47:00]  I don't know you were a sunny boy.  You know, I have no –  I have no need for this right now.  I have no mercy for any of these guys either because they're all caving into it.  They're apologizing.  Not one of these guys has the balls – you know who had the balls?  The manager of the White Sox who was just belligerent after he said what he said.  Yeah, all right, whatever.  Yeah, it was so – he was really belligerent about it and he kept his job.  I mean, the fact that –  Why are they so scared?  Because they're worms.  They are scared for their jobs.  No, they're not worms.  The guy was a tight end in the NFL.  I'd like to see him come in here and have you not feel sorry for him as he chokes you to death. 
[01:47:30]  With a giant hand around that blubber turkey neck.  He's like, no, I didn't mean you.  I meant they're all spokesmen.  They're all afraid for their jobs.  And they are worms.  Well, they're afraid for their jobs.  They have lovely kids to feed, you know.  You don't know how it is a family being.  You have to buy green ties for, you know, liven up your life once in a while.  It's the people that make them apologize.  The companies, ESPN, the head of – oh, who is it?  Josh.  Yeah, Josh, the head of public relations.  Josh. 
[01:48:00]  Josh, you know what I mean?  Vice president of this.  All these people should just ignore it.  Well, I want just one of these companies to play it out and see what actually would happen.  Yeah, see what will happen.  See what will happen.  It's a dumb little comment that has been said a million times.  You know, let them be.  And see if there's going to be a huge boycott.  Are they really going to rally the troops over that?  Well, I saw a boycott movie the other night on HBO, and it was a really shocking story.  It was about a group of Mexicans called Walkout.  These Mexicans left school early. 
[01:48:30]  Are you kidding?  I couldn't believe it.  Hey, we got the audio of the guy actually doing the comment.  Here it is.  It looks like a pass that needs to be caught.  Yeah, you can't use your shoulder to catch a football.  You've got to get your hands out there every night that I'm out there with my kids working on catching the football.  They want to use their body.  It's just a natural instinct as a human being.  But you've got to learn to be able to put the ball in your hands.  Your hands are what makes it possible.  Your shoulder pads are hard and stiff.  Your hands are tender, and they can move and caress the ball. 
[01:49:00]  That's kind of gay, but hey, close.  Fourth down.  He is silent.  Oh, he knew right then.  The silence.  That is the silence.  The silence of, uh-oh.  Every man for themselves.  Yeah, abandon ship.  I want to acknowledge that that was just said because I want to keep my job.  The disturbing part is that he said, I'm out there with my kids every night, and then he goes into that. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, oh, for caressing.  Yeah, this guy could be like one of them child molestators.  He realized that ESPN wouldn't put up with that, but he made an honest mistake.  He wasn't purposely trying to, you know, piss off any group.  And the way the guy was saying it, it did sound a little gay.  If you ask me.  There's no differentiating between, like, just some silly, offhanded remark and true hate speech.  The left just stinks.  And sort of the right, the conservatives who are afraid of being protested, they all just suck.  And a bunch of cowards.  Why don't you sit up? 
[01:50:00]  Because I'm relaxing, Carl.  Don't be a fag.  Oh, excuse me.  I didn't mean to say that.  I meant cigarette.  Don't be a cigarette, Carl.  Jimmy Norton has been suspended.  Oh, boy.  I meant to say, don't be such a silly girl.  This really is the left that started this.  And all I ever hear of them, it's like, oh, yeah, do you believe?  Like, they did something recently where they were mocking, like, some political correctness.  I'm like, you guys started it.  Yeah.  And you cemented it.  And it's such a double standard.  Some people said things, people were like, oh, come on, let it go.  And then other people, yeah.  Nausy ace-men.  Gee, like when Jerry Brown said something where he dropped an N-bomb and Sharpton defended him, 
[01:50:30]  saying, well, you know, he's good to the black community and blah, blah, blah.  But yet if it had been somebody else who'd defeat him, come on.  Yeah, James Byrd was in the Klan.  He's a Democrat.  Is he?  Yeah.  Wow, really?  He's a Klansman.  He's a Democrat, huh?  James Byrd.  I don't know about James.  I don't know.  All right, let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt, I hope he knows it's time to bail.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Matt, what's up?  I saw the clip, and I thought there was nothing wrong with it, but if the whole country is 
[01:51:00]  always like that, they can't even upset two people, like where two gays would say, oh,  well, that puts like a negative connotation on being gay.  Yeah.  If you say gay cash.  But that's just the language now.  I mean, you know, 50 years ago, no one had any problem saying the N-word, and everybody  used it.  I don't know why we have to be punished because of a lot of mean-spirited crap.  Yeah, please, when the mics are off.  For no reason at all, we'll say it.  When talking about the Osmond, we find a way to squeeze it in. 
[01:51:30]  But why are we being punished?  That's a man's man right there, Colin.  We're being punished with humor, and humor, because of horrible things people said and  did in the 1950s, and I'm tired of it.  Why should my humor suffer?  Because there's something some hillbilly said before he created some strange fruit, if I  might.  Right.  Exactly.  Strange fruit.  And how many gays are watching ESPN anyway?  Nine!  Probably not.  They all want to be the center.  Right.  They're watching all those home decorating shows on TLC.  Nobody wants to be the star, the quarterback, who throws the forward pass. 
[01:52:00]  The forward pass.  That new thing.  That's what I do when my friends are watching football.  I ruin it by saying things like, well, this guy should throw a forward pass.  And by the way, why, you know, a bunch of gay guys want to run around and redecorate  your queer eye for the straight guy.  Eh, fine.  We're a bunch of queers.  Let's go.  Yeah, you say queer?  This guy makes an offhanded remark about gays.  And he, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he knew right away, too.  Oh, they all just suck.  When I was growing up, queer was one of the most negative things you could say about a 
[01:52:30]  gay person.  You're like, queer.  That guy's a queer.  He's a queer band.  And now it's been accepted by gays.  They use it on, like you say, queer eye for the straight guy.  They use it.  George Collins.  It's the name of a TV show.  Yeah, exactly.  George Collins did the best bit of all time.  He goes, when I was going to the fag, he was like, go home, fag.  It's 10 o'clock.  He goes, the fag was the guy that wouldn't go downtown with you and beat up queers.  Let's go to Jake in Texas.  Jake.  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Oh, I just love when we gay bash. 
[01:53:00]  Sorry.  Let's see if San Francisco dumps out of this.  I'm sure they will.  They're not going to get much of a show today.  Jake, what's up?  What are the gays going to do?  Boycott going to football games?  Wouldn't that be...  That's my point.  Yeah, that's the point.  It's not the core audience, but there's groveling executives.  They are just groveling, just college boy douches.  They're just groveling douches.  Someone's got to stick up for the gay community.  I don't think they care about this crap. 
[01:53:30]  They don't care.  They're not.  They really don't care about this crap.  They just don't get beat up in high school, you know?  That's it.  They've been joking about it, too.  It's the corporate asses that are completely out of touch with what really is going on out there.  The special interest groups, why do they like, you know, the gay, a lot of glad...  I mean, they're a little hypersensitive and irritating, just like the ADL is, you know?  But it's like most gay people could care less about some offhanded remark like that that's not meant to be nasty.  Well, I disagree.  I think Linda Stassi says it best.  Oh, boy.  But she had to mention her. 
[01:54:00]  She said, there's a real gut buster.  Yeah.  I was holding my sides.  She said something.  It had me in stitches.  She was talking.  She was giving four stars to the three, or the 1.2 New Chappelle episodes that were released.  And she said...  1.2.  She had to buckle herself in to keep from falling off the seat.  Off the couch, she says.  Off the couch.  Buckled herself in with her cadaver hands.  She's got seatbelts on her couch.  She does.  That's hysterical right there.  Oh, God.  I'm so glad she gave four stars to that monumentally long DVD set. 
[01:54:30]  Maybe she doesn't watch it on the camera.  Maybe she has seatbelts because she watches it in her truck like,  Flav, Flav.  Having a little video in the...  Ah, forget it.  All right.  We got a break.  We're late.  When we get back, we got taser clips.  Yeah, we got to play these.  We'll play them when we get back.  What are the tasers?  Love taser clips.  It's just clips of people, criminals being tasered. 
[01:55:00]  That's funny.  And they're all belligerent and nasty right up until they get tased.  They're all just horrific.  Then they're very cooperative.  Huh?  I thought I heard you guys saying something about The View.  What the heck was it?  Oh, there's a little story about The View.  They discussed the John Kerry Iraq joke.  And I'm sure Rosie was outraged.  No, it actually came down to Joy and that dope Elizabeth.  I guess she's eye candy, but she stinks when it comes to talking about real issues. 
[01:55:30]  I got to guess Joy and Rosie were probably not...  It's not a big deal.  I don't think they were outraged.  No, it was Elizabeth that just lost her mind.  I mean, that's good stuff, too.  So now we have a decision to make.  Oh, no.  We'll figure it out during the break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Colin Quinn in studio.  What are we promoting there, Colin?  When are you at Gotham?  Oh, Gotham Comedy Club.  Cool.  When are you there?  Folks, if you really want to have some gut-busting good times, come to the Gotham Comedy Club Thursday through Sunday.  Starting tonight.  Every seat has a seatbelt.  Tonight, one show, 9.30. 
[01:56:00]  All off.  One show tonight, 9.30, and then two shows Friday, Tuesday, Saturday, and one Sunday.  Gotham Comedy Club.  And I put Keith Robinson off the show.  Did you really?  Yep.  Good.  Why?  Well.  Because they had booked other people, so I canceled them.  Good.  Bye, Keith.  Gotham Comedy Club, 23rd Street between 7th and 8th Avenues, 212-367-9000 for Colin Quinn.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony Show are appearing in a special holiday edition of FHM. 
[01:56:30]  On sale now.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202.  Opie and Anthony.  All right.  It's me and you, Ant.  I love it.  Jimmy got so upset he had to run into the bathroom.  I don't know.  Watch this happen.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:57:00]  The Opie virus spreading across America.  Did he get upset with seeing Rick and Bubba on Fox and Friends?  No.  It was just some promo that played for a TV show.  Oh.  And he didn't quite get it.  I don't get it either.  What is it for?  It's for some...  I don't know.  It's for some show.  And what does the guy say?  Here comes Jimmy.  I don't know if it's CSI or it's just one of these...  I'm so sick of these uncreative douches in television.  The promo is this for some show. 
[01:57:30]  It's a lawyer show called Sharks.  And the...  Starring James Woods.  And the one...  And here's the promo.  The one guy goes, I hope you know what you're doing.  And the guy goes, don't I always?  Who's watching because of that?  The whole...  Well, then they do lasers and stuff or what?  Yeah.  Yes.  It stinks.  Well, maybe they marketed and said, you know, a lot of people feel like they don't know what  they're doing in the world.  If we had a show where somebody really was sure of themselves, people would be into it.  Oh, my God.  Don't I always?  I wish I was more like him. 
[01:58:00]  Wow.  I have to watch this.  I'll tell you what.  That guy really grabs a bull by the horn.  That's what they're going to call that show.  Bull by the Horn Grabber.  But you, you, you, you, you.  CBS.  CBS.  CBS.  I hate it.  It's like sitcoms.  They'll never show you a funny line.  Honey, you're late from work.  Well, aren't I late yesterday?  There's one that's running on Fox.  And it is horrific.  I saw it yesterday.  I wanted to throw something through the TV.  It's a guy and a girl, of course.  And they're talking.  And the guy says something about liking a girl that reads. 
[01:58:30]  And the girl says to him, ha, ha, yeah, because guys are always looking for girls with big  books.  Hmm.  I just stared blankly at the television.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  What?  Big books.  Big books.  And you hear just, wah!  Canned laughter.  Canned laughs.  Canned laughter, yeah.  Canned laughs.  Canned, yeah.  Canned laughs come flying out like it's the funniest thing that was ever, ever spoken. 
[01:59:00]  Caggot public.  You deserve what you get.  Watching shows with canned laughter.  You should all be shot.  Well, some shows are good with canned laughter.  Canned laughter.  Really?  Yes.  Like MASH?  No.  Like, oh yeah, MASH.  That was always good.  MASH was good.  Yeah, I know.  That was always good.  Canned laughter said it right.  Canned laughter ruined sitcom writing because you didn't have to be funny.  You were guaranteed to laugh.  Yeah.  However, Groucho said it.  I was going to say, did he say it in that elongated?  No.  He probably said it brilliantly and funny.  I remember him being a little more eloquent than that, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I'm just kind of clumsily. 
[01:59:30]  I'm kind of paraphrasing with Groucho.  I can't get the view audio to work.  No.  Maybe this freaking CD player just needs to be replaced.  That's probably what it is.  It's meant to be that we watched the taser thing instead.  Do you know what show at Canned Laughs that really makes me laugh?  It's a British show.  Alan Partridge show.  I don't like the way you said it's a British show.  Don't say it.  Hey, listen, Madonna.  Don't say it.  Don't say British with a British accent.  Nothing.  No, but it's a British show.  Oh, give a shot, you're facing.  I ran through all of the proper channels as far as my adoption goes. 
[02:00:00]  My husband spends a lot of time.  Uh, we went through everything we were supposed to.  We weren't given any preferential treatment.  It was as per our schedule.  She talks the way you talk right after you bite your tongue.  She has that thing where you don't want to talk too roughly because it's so tender.  All right, we're going to do taser clips.  Tasers.  The John Kerry view thing isn't working.  Taser.  Tasers.  Yeah.  Rick and Bubba fighting for the mic and the picture.  They're both holding it. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, this looks real.  They just showed Rick and Bubba.  I guess they do a show in Alabama, is it?  Oh, it's in Alabama.  And they show their publicity shot and they both have their fists on their chins.  It's like they're holding their chins as if they're thinking, like you'd grab your chin  to go, hmm.  And they're doing that.  Yeah, you do that if you're living in the 50s.  Kind of back to back.  Oh, this is.  And you know what?  Fox and Friends, you stink for the radio guys you're putting on. 
[02:01:00]  I'm sorry.  Why don't you just stop it?  We did their show once and we did a really good job and we were never asked back.  We do a lot of shows once.  We do a lot of shows once.  Well, today in our disposable media, I guess that's okay.  We did best week ever once and that was before we came back to the fine company that is CVS.  And they put everybody on there.  Well, but they realized that the best week ever, they're fans of our show and they put 
[02:01:30]  us on without asking the bigwigs.  Bigwigs found out and went, you had those guys on best week ever?  Are you crazy?  Do you want to be fired?  You know, they're sitting out.  They stopped returning our calls, unfortunately.  Oops.  But now we're back as one happy family, so.  You got to put some, here's what you got to put on.  You got to put on a chick who has nothing to say and some gay guy who every time we make  a fashion show, oh, that collar's too big.  More clips.  And at least one new guy.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, Carl. 
[02:02:00]  Almost slipped up there.  All right, now we're going back to the view stuff.  Viewer taser, someone help me out here.  Help me out here, Henry.  Let's taser the view.  How about one taser video?  Just give them a little tease.  Trying to go and do a clip here.  Right, I don't know what to do anymore.  We have six taser clips.  We'll play this one.  All right.  All right, there you go.  It sounded like voice. 
[02:02:30]  It sounded like voice.  All right, here we go.  We all know by now what John Kerry said, right?  Yes.  It's in there.  Okay, and then the view, because it's just such a terrific show for the housewives out  there.  They discussed the John Kerry joke that went wrong.  It doesn't even sound like the joke was a joke.  Like the joke was, it was just as bad as what he said. 
[02:03:00]  He's a stiff, horrid bore.  Who should never, never attempt humor.  No, he shouldn't talk.  Yeah.  Somebody should frag that guy, man.  All right, here we go.  A lot of news about John Kerry.  Did you hear what he said in the response?  Did everybody know?  Yeah, I didn't actually see it.  I saw it this morning.  Take a look at the tape.  This is what he actually said during a campaign speech, so to speak.  You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework,  and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well. 
[02:03:30]  If you don't, you get stuck in a rack.  Stop.  Right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, here's the prepared text that was in his speech that he didn't read.  Was, do you know where you end up if you don't study, if you aren't smart, if you are intellectually lazy?  You end up getting stuck in a war in Iraq.  Just ask President Bush.  That's what he was supposed to say.  Yeah.  But what came out was something different.  Well, then why wouldn't he have said, when I make a mistake, I would have gone, oops, sorry, I meant. 
[02:04:00]  I meant.  Not two days later.  A war.  Right.  In Iraq, like President Bush.  So all those bad things he was saying about not being educated was supposed to be pointed  at Bush and not the troops.  Bush is like lazy intellect, saying that he's a dope who got them into a war.  But then wouldn't he have said, here's where you end up running a war you can't get out of.  But he didn't say that.  No, even then it kind of, you're still kind of thinking, is he talking about the troops?  He's a dope.  And if a conservative had made this kind of a blunder, believe me, Rosie would not have 
[02:04:30]  taken that kind of view and neither would the rest of the left.  But now it's like, oh, it's just a joke.  Yeah.  Well, the Democrats did attack him.  Republicans make better blunders.  Yes, they do.  Email slippings.  They certainly do.  Young lads in tight bikini shorts exercising.  Republican blunders are sexy.  Well, Rosie stayed out of this one.  It actually was Joy Behar and Elizabeth Hasselbeck or Hasselbeck or whatever.  She's on the show because she's great eye candy.  But so she tries to attempt to discuss something.  It's just awful.  It's just awful. 
[02:05:00]  And then he said he bought the joke.  You know, leave this to the professionals.  John Kerry's put a sock in it.  He's not funny.  I mean, I really mean it.  It's like he's not running for anything right now.  He should have kept his big mouth shut.  I think you sound stupid.  But I also have to say that I feel very sad that John McCain and John Kerry are arguing  and fighting over the support for the troops from both of them are veterans of Vietnam.  And these draft dodgers, Bush, Rumsfeld, and Cheney are making hay over this.  America, wake up. 
[02:05:30]  Wait a second.  Wake up and just be thankful.  You know, whether you agree or disagree, Joy's got a point.  And she made it perfectly clear.  George W.  Making hay does not mean making a big deal over this.  She misused the term making hay.  What does it mean?  George W. served.  Yeah, he did.  He served.  He was a pilot.  In Alabama.  Yeah.  I like that fact.  You know, people attack Alabama.  You know, in the V.C. with those tunnels they could dig?  That's right.  They pop up in Alabama.  All of a sudden, people go, hey, Rick and Bubba.  He was a crop duster in Alabama. 
[02:06:00]  He was in Alabama.  That's about all he did.  Wait a second.  Wake up and just be thankful.  Here comes Elizabeth.  You know, when he said that, that makes me mad.  Right.  When I heard him saying that, I just kind of made me feel thankful that he, that John Kerry  isn't the President of the United States.  You know, that was a possibility.  He's so elitist.  And he makes just, I think he does.  Yeah, that's right.  I believe he thinks he's better than everybody else.  And if he was talking about President Bush, and he was saying, if you did your homework, 
[02:06:30]  President Bush had a higher IQ than he does, and he also had better grades than he did  ever.  Well, they both went to Yale.  They both had money.  Why is a Kerry an elitist and Bush not?  I don't understand.  Well, John Kerry talks like he's got.  Because Bush talks like he's been tested.  He just speaks good English.  That's right.  And I forgot.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I'm not just a challenge.  You've got a good Kerry.  Charlie can forth all the time.  We're not doing a John Kerry's anthem.  You can keep quiet in this, Rosie.  It's good for you.  I just, yeah.  Go ahead.  We'll handle this.  You know what I love? 
[02:07:00]  This show is completely falling apart, and Barbara Walters is trying to keep it together.  It's the most entertaining thing to watch.  Well, I love the show.  Me and my friends, we save our vacuuming for afterwards.  All that show needed was for Flav to come out for 55 minutes.  Right.  For them to completely lose control.  Unbelievable.  Joy and Rosie, I like both.  The two comments.  Oh, absolutely.  I like.  Absolutely.  Just the other ones.  Barbara Walters, I'd love her to just have a stroke while she's walking her dog, and as  she falls into the street, a bus runs over the top of her skull, and not kills her, 
[02:07:30]  just cuts off any movement below the neck.  Except for pain.  What?  Except for unrelenting pain.  The show's coming.  Yes, you're right.  That's the only emotion she has.  As she blows into the tube, her bottom hurts.  The show's going to evolve into Rosie's show.  It should.  Bill Perry was like Mel Gibson without the booze yesterday when he said this, okay?  Like, he.  All right, Elizabeth.  Yeah, you go good.  Whether he meant it or not, it's out there, and it hurt a lot of people.  It hurt families of troops.  It hurt the troops out there, and he should be more responsible.  He really should. 
[02:08:00]  He made a mistake.  How many botched jokes has Bush made?  I have a whole book of Bushism.  It hurts my ass.  What do you see me?  Come and see me perform.  You'll read.  I'll read through some of the Bushism.  I love it.  Yeah.  Things are really the first flying over there.  Why can't they just agree that both of them are blithering idiots?  Why can't they?  Well, I think what they should both say is, look, let's stop this.  We have holes.  We shouldn't talk politics.  What are you cooking for Thanksgiving? 
[02:08:30]  What kind of muffins are you making?  That's right.  This is where it gets...  When your man asks for coffee, what is it?  Black or light and sweet?  This is where it gets really heated.  This gets very entertaining here.  Charlie Gibson's going to be on with us coming up next.  Well, I don't know whether this really hurts the Democratic Party.  Is this just John Kerry?  What do you think?  Or does this really spill over on the Democrats?  Well, as long as the people who are against the Democrats are going to make hay out of this and lie about their record and go and continue to say that this war has been a good idea, when everybody knows it's not them, then they're going to win. 
[02:09:00]  If people are stupid enough to believe that, then go ahead.  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Why are you saying that?  Because I'm a person who believes that this war is justified in fact that we're fighting global terrorism.  So I don't appreciate saying if you're stupid enough to believe that.  I don't believe they've done everything right, okay?  I'm going out there now on a limb, Elizabeth.  I'm going out on a limb right now with that.  But maybe not.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead. 
[02:09:30]  Let's go.  Go ahead.  Look, you can make two choices.  This is a hot time for elections.  We're seeing more ads now than I care to about politics.  I just think to separate it and say if you're dumb enough to believe that you should be fighting this war, then you deserve what you get.  Look, we know that there were no weapons of mass destruction now that we went under fool's pretences.  John Kerry was not in power.  John Kerry would have done the same thing.  No, he would not.  He would have done that after his seventh flip-flop.  He went in there.  Look, forget about John Kerry for a second, okay?  You just reminded me of him.  How am I supposed to forget?  Let me do one point, okay? 
[02:10:00]  Stop it.  People who love Barbara.  Why is she doing that?  First of all, Elizabeth should be giving that speech out of minivan window.  She's not qualified.  Joy is too smart for her.  That's what I'm loving about that.  Don't you understand?  Why did they hire somebody who's not smart who's on the right?  Of course.  Exactly.  Come on.  She's more of a soccer mom type of mentality as opposed to a really bright.  As opposed to what?  Joy?  I mean, Rosie's not a soccer mom? 
[02:10:30]  No, no, no.  I'm saying that they're comics.  They run circles around her mentally.  There's no way a dummy like that.  She argues like a soccer mom.  She's not smart enough to argue with people like Joy and Rosie.  She'll blurt out party line stuff that she reads in the paper.  No, maybe by his seventh flip-flop.  Is that what you have, stupid?  And they're saying intellectual things.  No, but they're just rapid-firing.  They're burning her.  They're throwing points at her.  They're firing points.  And she goes, yeah, well, I'm seeing more ads than I care to.  And after his seventh flip-flop. 
[02:11:00]  Well, she's right about one thing.  Some of these ads, I feel like they almost...  Drop from your lips to God's ears.  Hey, we love Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  Well, that's not him.  Wow, that's a bad one.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Did you say Paul R. Nelson?  Don't have time?  No, we don't have time.  That's too bad. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  Everyone panicked.  Everyone panicked.  All right, we got one more clip from The View.  As they try to discuss this.  Listen, I'm going to give you, just like I'm on Crossfire, the closing comment and you a closing comment.  And I would just like to say a start.  See, Rosie is just...  Rosie takes control.  It's her show.  You know...  You think Star would ever have done that?  No.  Barbara Walters is there.  But, you know, Rosie's like...  She understands how to produce a TV show.  When Rosie wants to talk, she grabs Barbara's hair by the back the way a man would on a date while the chick's in the passenger seat. 
[02:12:00]  And while she's talking, Barbara's going...  Closing comment and you a closing comment.  And I would just like to say a startling fact.  This is November 1st.  In October, we lost the most American troops ever.  Oh, that's intelligence.  Come on.  I'm talking about when they're back and forth.  And I'm talking about everything.  Yeah.  I don't like this new liberal attitude out of you.  No, it's not.  I'd say my point was that they hired...  Shut your face.  I'll tell you what your point was.  All right.  Well, you tell me after. 
[02:12:30]  You stick to your litterman sets, kid.  You're good at them.  No, my point was that she's a dumbbell who's not qualified to make that argument.  There's a lot of women who are brighter...  Opie, shut him up.  He's slipping.  The show's not as good.  No, I like what Jimmy's saying.  No, Joe's getting dope.  I'm right.  She's so out of her league.  She's a dope.  And the other two are what?  She's just reciting to the policy experts.  No, but they're...  They're reciting stuff on the left.  They're better at debating, and they're funnier people.  And they're better at what they're doing, which is...  It's a talk show.  You know who's funny?  Me.  You certainly are. 
[02:13:00]  And he's going to be appearing at Caroline's.  No, silly.  I'm at Gotham.  Elizabeth should be talking about, like, Hollywood gossip.  Yeah.  You know, stuff she's good at.  Instead of reciting stuff she reads in a stupid book that anyone could get at Barnes & Noble.  There's a whole section now.  You've got the Ann Coulter book.  You've got the...  Right next to the Michael Myers book.  Right next to the Al Franken book.  All you do is read that for an hour, and you feel like an expert on all this stuff.  You know everything.  That's exactly what she sounds like.  Joy buried her with, well, they both went to Yale. 
[02:13:30]  Why is he an elitist?  And Bush isn't.  Well, because he talks like he's...  Well, she talks like what?  And because Bush talks like...  She just...  The way she was debating her, she was smacking her in the face.  Elizabeth would go, ah, ah, middle class housewife.  And she would smack her.  Middle class housewife statement.  Yeah.  It's, like, fine if you're going to make those statements, but don't be on a national television show.  We've got to get out of here, but let me get this last clip in.  American troops ever.  101 Americans were killed in a civil war in another country that had nothing to do with 9-11 
[02:14:00]  and that had no weapons of mass destruction.  Final comment, Joy?  There's people who love this war.  Why don't they send their husbands and children?  Okay.  Okay.  That's not typical comments from my son of a bitch.  I have one more thing to say.  I just think they should stop changing the conversation.  We are in the middle of a heinous war that is destroying our country.  That is splitting our country.  Stop talking about gay marriage.  I don't want to hear about gay marriage right now.  Then why'd you bring it up?  This war, stop it.  Elizabeth, you have a closing comment? 
[02:14:30]  If you want to go to the polls next week, I think you should choose to either fight  the war on terror or fight Republicans.  Pick your battle.  Okay?  And I think that voting is important, and if every woman watching this show did it, we  could change the course of the country.  And every man.  Every woman.  I thought, yeah.  None of you guys picked up on the fact that I said that.  What?  The Ann Coulter book was right next to the Michael Myers book.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  Michael Myers is a...  You're not trying to make a great point about... 
[02:15:00]  He's talking about Michael...  I think you meant Michael Moore.  No, but there's a black writer, Michael Myers.  He's like...  Oh, really?  I thought he meant the guy from Halloween.  So did I.  Oh, my God.  Or Austin Powers.  Thank you, Snap Man from Whack Bag.  There I am trying to make an intelligent point.  That's it.  I say Michael Myers.  You all of a sudden turned into that dopey dame from The View.  Yeah, I certainly did.  What an ass.  This is Paul R. Nelson, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you, Paul R. Nelson.  Michael Myers.  Oh, God.  I should stick to just...  Michael Myers.  I should stick to just stomping on cakes.  I'm reading that one.  That's all I'm good at.  I'm reading that one right after I read the Jason Voorhees book.  I hear that's pretty good.  Michael Myers is a political writer.  Oh, thanks, Colin.  You're going to help me out earlier.  But no one knows that.  What does making hay...  I said that earlier.  Shut up.  What does making hay mean, since you seem to know what it doesn't mean?  Making hay while the sun shines means not starting trouble, like she said, but it means 
[02:16:00]  doing, you know, making hay, doing your work while the sun's out.  What the hell?  No one knows what he just said.  Thank you, Elizabeth.  It just means making...  What?  No, he said...  I said making hay doesn't mean starting trouble.  You're using...  Working.  You're using stuff that's out there to, like, start trouble.  No.  That's not what it means.  Making hay.  I grew up in Iowa.  Iowa.  And, uh...  No, making hay while the sun shines. 
[02:16:30]  You know what that means.  It doesn't mean starting trouble while the sun's out.  So what does it mean again?  It means just working.  Doing your stuff while you can do it while the sun's out.  Make hay of it.  You can't make hay when it's dark out, I guess.  Yeah?  Maybe one of our Texas listeners could call in and clarify, because we don't know this stuff.  You're making hay of this.  No, this is a long story.  I just want people to forget about my Michael Myers comment.  You should be an expert on hay, because you're an ass.  Kenny's an expert on hay.  Just look at his hair. 
[02:17:00]  Another dry hair joke.  Yes, people.  Colin Quinn at Gotham Comedy Club, starting tonight through Sunday.  One show tonight at 930.  That's between 7th and 8th on 23rd Street.  Gotham Comedy Club, 212-367-9000.  Always a pleasure, Colin.  Thanks, guys.  Are you going to XM with us so you can curse?  No, I've got to go do an interview.  With who?  Oh.  Some newspaper stuff.  At my publicist's office.  Some newspaper.  You're getting too comfortable with this show.  You're making hay.  With what?  You're getting too comfortable with this show. 
[02:17:30]  What do you mean?  You're going to take all the distance with us.  Well, guess what?  It said on my sheet you only want to be until 830.  That's not true.  Yeah, well, how about this for truth?  What?  Last time I called in, I called in.  Oh, Opie's going to be.  Oh, no.  What?  Two months ago, I called in.  You want to talk about discomfort?  Two months ago, I called in.  Remember?  Because the time I called in before, Opie goes,  he always hits like three good ones, and then he hangs up.  He knows when to go.  Yeah.  I think he's right.  I do.  I call up.  Some dummy on the phone goes to me. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, Opie says,  we're probably too busy for you today.  Oh, no.  And you might say,  shut up and let me finish.  Let me finish, Opie.  So I go,  I listened to the show that morning,  because I was staying up all night at the time.  You know what it was?  It was an important show.  It was the day after the first live comedy show.  So it was really important.  And I think Bill Burr called in.  Oh.  And I think maybe,  I think Patrice might have stopped by.  It's not like it was a big celebrity day.  I can understand that.  Why do you smell that show, you creep? 
[02:18:30]  All right, listen, we've got to go.  We're late.  Sorry.  Yeah, we're late.  Colin Quinn at Gotham Comedy Club tonight.  All right?  All right, folks.  It's a real gut buster.  All right.  If you're not joining us at XM, have a great day.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit. 
[02:19:00]  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas,  or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  The Opie and Anthony XM Walkover begins now.  We're halfway done with the walk.  The walkover.  It's the freezeover.  Oh, Christ.  What happened?  I don't know.  It was warmer this morning.  When it was raining, the rain stopped, and now it's cold,  so we decided to start walking.  We're already up to the first corner. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, I want to thank the faithful listeners for coming out, even in the cold weather.  What do we got?  Two people out here today?  Two.  Three.  Yeah, when it's warm, it's 100.  Jerry, when it's cold, it's two.  Oh, look.  The tables aren't out anymore here at our through 57.  Oh, it's just depressing.  It stinks.  They're getting rid of the outdoor tables.  Overcast and cold.  The homeless people are going underground.  God, I hate winter.  Hey, let's see if our FHM is in with our guy there.  Oh, with our pal. 
[02:20:00]  We're in the December issue of FHM Magazine with all our pals.  Yes.  Rich Voss, Otto and George, Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, Patrice O'Neill.  Where was Colin?  I don't know.  Why wasn't he involved in that?  I don't know why.  That's a very good question.  I bet if we were in Honcho, he would want it to be involved.  Honcho.  Here we are.  Can you find it?  We're at the newsstand.  Let's see. 
[02:20:30]  FHM.  I don't think it came in yet.  Oh, this guy's buying Playboy.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Like those.  Go ahead.  Buy your Playboy.  Like those chicks.  It would have been awkward if you were buying inches as this whole crowd showed up.  But it's Playboy.  You're all right.  He just ran away.  He was buying Playboy.  You're scared of Playboy.  He was all embarrassed.  I don't know.  I don't see it.  Well, let's ask our friend.  FHM.  How are you, FHM? 
[02:21:00]  No, not yet, Mark.  Not yet.  Stuff came out, but no FHM.  Dropped something.  Hopefully tonight.  You said Tuesday.  That's right.  Yeah, but it's not came out yet.  That only stuff came out.  But we earned that magazine.  But we're in that magazine.  We're in it.  Treat yourselves.  But we're in it.  Damn.  All right.  We'll check tomorrow then.  We'll check back.  We're very excited because we're in the issue.  We're going to show you.  If it ain't here, some legs are going to get broken, sir. 
[02:21:30]  That's right.  Don't want to threaten.  We got some phone calls this morning that it was out, and it's shrink-wrapped, which is pissing off our listeners because they just wanted to check out the pictures.  Just want to look and leave it back in the newsstand.  It's the December issue, by the way.  A lot of people are getting confused because it's a Thanksgiving issue, but you know how the magazines work.  The magazines work.  There's a Fourth of July issue coming out next month.  Well, they only do that with, like, the smut magazines.  I think Playboy's up to, yeah, like January 2007 already. 
[02:22:00]  Atlanta.  All right.  No, let's not.  Oh!  Going to get run over.  Wow, this guy almost got run over by the bus.  You see that?  That would have looked great.  You all right, sir?  Thumbs up.  All right.  He just missed him.  Wow.  I hate bus drivers.  That guy had no clue that bus was barreling down on him.  Not like a bus would have hurt him.  Well, we had the walk sign, though.  Splat.  I am so glad I have this big, stupid coat.  It is the dumbest looking coat, but it keeps me toasty. 
[02:22:30]  It doesn't matter.  How much for the child, miss?  How much?  Damn it.  I think I can buy me a baby.  You dropped something.  Miss?  I think that was three of Flavor Flav's wives.  Oh, shit.  Waiting for the bus.  Wow, you know.  You wait for the bus, bitch.  I'm going right in.  Why would we not? 
[02:23:00]  This is way too cold, and it's going to get so much colder.  Oh, this is balmy compared to what it's going to be.  What is this, like 45?  When I am not on the walk with you guys.  Speaking of balmy, Colin Quinn tonight at the Gotham Comedy Club.  You guys are going at it today there, Jimmy.  Who stopped in front?  There is such a love-hate relationship with them.  Oh, I just love it.  Now they love each other.  There, I could tell.  Oh, look who's here, pal. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  I'm done with the XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[02:24:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  Opie.  You know I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm Dave.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[02:24:30]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  Welcome to the second half of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Exclusively on XM Satellite Radio.  Where's my feedback? 
[02:26:00]  Thank you, sir.  What's the password?  Oh, there you go.  What happened to the guys?  What happened? 
[02:26:30]  Did they get in trouble on the elevator?  I don't know.  It's probably a bathroom break.  Oh.  John Minnelli's here.  The new PD at Free FM here in New York City.  He goes, I noticed that you take a different elevator than Anthony and Jim.  And I had to explain that.  I just can't take the Jim Norton gags anymore.  It's so uncomfortable.  You better explain.  He shouldn't be on that side of the room.  That's Anthony's.  Oh, boy.  That's all right.  Oh, boy, John.  Oh, boy.  That's all right.  The new guy.  You're obviously the new guy. 
[02:27:00]  John is fine.  This is quite the setup over here.  You haven't been over here yet?  I should have been years ago, and I never did.  Right.  Yeah.  And I really like the motorcade kind of situation where you guys move from one place to the other.  That's pretty impressive, right?  There was really nothing much going on today, though.  Well, this is the first walkover that John Minnelli did.  There was nothing going on today.  It's cold and rainy and damp in New York.  You should have been here last week.  We had some great walkovers.  Some days, it's an hour out there just screwing around with New Yorkers, and today, eh, cold, miserable people. 
[02:27:30]  And we didn't have a lot of people today.  There was about five, I think.  Yeah.  Maybe five did the walkover today.  I've heard a lot of the walkovers, because my normal MO before I started this job was to record you guys on both and then listen to you later.  But I didn't know that you did not take the elevator with them, and he really is bothered by that.  Did you know that?  Oh, the elevator thing.  What are you doing, John?  Well, Jimmy, you didn't hear.  John Minnelli gets in the elevator with me, and he goes, oh, I noticed you take a different elevator than Jim and Anthony, and I just can't take the gas. 
[02:28:00]  Why?  It's so uncomfortable.  Well, no, I do, but Jimmy will gas blow out a fart or something.  But it's not always.  And recently, you've taken a new tag.  Today, as a matter of fact, the elevator ride-up had some women on there.  And I jammed my hand in the elevator door to make sure it opened up so we can get on that elevator.  And then Jimmy went into a speech about how dangerous it was and this detailed, horrific story of a gentleman being torn in two as horrified women are standing in the elevator. 
[02:28:30]  Pictures of an ogre of a doctor.  It's actually a very true story.  Some of those old elevators, the sensors don't work anymore, so they close on you.  And, man, this one picture I saw was a guy ripped in half because the elevator had just gone up with him attached to it.  There was nothing he could do.  Would you remember New York?  I think within the past year, some lady in the elevator, when that happened to somebody else trying to get in, the head plopped off and fell in the car with the head. 
[02:29:00]  The elevator didn't line up with the floor at one point.  And a woman was in there.  So a guy decided he was going to get in.  And he kind of was climbing into it.  And he had his hands on the ledge.  And his head was sticking out.  And the thing just dropped.  Wait, it dropped?  And his...  She had to ride down, I think, with the body without the head. 
[02:29:30]  And the head was left where on the floor that...  Oh, because you wanted to get out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How great is that?  It fell and she rode down with the body.  I wonder if she went through the pockets.  Yeah.  Oh, God, I come through the pockets.  Is that it for you, John?  I mean, I...  You know, my only goal is good shows.  And that's why I frequently leave early.  I mean, you know...  Yeah, you're not that great.  But if you require my services...  What's up with the jacket? 
[02:30:00]  Can we talk about that?  Oh, okay.  It's kind of...  Look at John's so...  I like it.  What?  I don't know.  You're just so sweet.  Is that tweed?  Well, I think...  Or herringbone, I'm not sure what you call it.  But it's...  I'm wearing James Cagney's jacket from his later years, which I picked up at his estate  sale auction in New York.  How much?  It wasn't that much because...  Well, I bought a scrapbook of his.  He had several of them that his wife did.  And that was about 700.  This was 10 to 15 years ago, actually. 
[02:30:30]  And this jacket...  I got two of his jackets for about 500 total.  Big Jimmy Cagney fandom.  Oh, yes.  That's not bad at all.  And one of them I did not have tailored.  You know, I just left just as is.  But this one I had...  His shoulders are the same because, you know, he's a small guy like me.  But I had it pulled in a little because he was portly toward the end.  Ah.  And then I have a picture of...  Do you have a picture of him wearing that actual jacket?  Like, do you know what he wore the jacket for?  No, it wasn't.  It was not in a film.  Not in a film?  Just personal life, working around. 
[02:31:00]  Connecticut Yankee, it says.  And he had a farm in upstate New York.  Eating at the Brown Derby.  He had a farm in upstate New York at the end.  And...  When did he die?  What year?  Oh.  Well, the estate auction was quite a few years after his death.  That was his family put on.  He died in, like, 97, right?  Oh, longer than that.  Happy.  Well, I'm not sure.  I don't remember.  I should know, but I don't know.  Had to be longer ago.  Longer than that.  It's kind of creepy.  It's a dead guy's jacket.  It was Cagney.  It was Cagney.  Cagney's not dead.  He lives on.  He lives on.  Legend.  Oh, good point.  One of the original...  Does he walk around your apartment now? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  How cool would that be?  The jacket just starts...  Don't creep him out now.  He just starts walking around the apartment.  I'm not going to be able to use...  No one has bothered me in my apartment since I acquired this, I will say that.  That's why I can't, like, own antiques and stuff.  I'm just like...  This is, like, dead people stuff.  It's creepy to me.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  I like new stuff.  But, although, it is cool.  I can't deny that.  It's very cool that you got something.  Yeah.  Someone at the station actually paid a compliment and said, what a nice jacket.  Yeah.  Normally, I don't wear it.  Was it a...  Let me just say... 
[02:32:00]  Was it another on-air personality who was, like, worried?  It's a nice jacket.  Oh, I hear you.  No.  I don't know the gentleman's name yet, but he's in the office next to the controller.  Okay.  So, I don't know who that was yet, but...  All right.  You didn't pick up William Frawley's pants at the same auction, did you?  Well, those actually...  I do use those for camping.  It's my tent.  Yeah.  The big ones.  With, like, two smoke stacks.  I gotcha.  Right.  Hey, a couple of some feedbacks coming in. 
[02:32:30]  And Rock Hudson's tie.  Opie stomps on some homeless guy's cake, but he cannot take a little gas or a little gag  from a little Jimmy Norton.  I know.  It doesn't make sense.  Jimmy's one of the only people in my life that makes me uncomfortable.  He does a great job of making me uncomfortable.  He's one of the only ones.  Because I got to admit it, he does things where you're like, oh, God, I just want to, like,  disappear.  I don't want to be any part of it, but I want to see it.  So, in order to see it, you have to be around it.  Like, I don't like when I'm involved because it's so uncomfortable. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Yet, it's still hysterically funny.  But I like when I'm in the elevator and no one knows that I'm going to the same floor,  doing the same show with Jimmy, and he just goes off.  Because I love watching horrified people.  And Jimmy knows how to horrify the people.  Make hay.  To make use of a situation or circumstance, especially in order to gain an advantage.  I said.  No, well, they're saying Colin is an effing retard.  We can say it over here.  Colin is a fucking retard. 
[02:33:30]  Colin, completely wrong.  And then the definition from a dictionary.  Thank you, Josh, from New Jersey.  All right, let's say hi to Rob in Arizona.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, any chance I can come up?  What do you mean?  Any chance I can come up there?  I'm down on the street here.  I'm from Arizona.  I'm freezing my balls off.  And I got a T-shirt, Anthony might like.  Did you do the walkover today?  Oh, jeez.  Wonder what it is.  No, I missed it.  I got stuck in traffic.  All right, yeah, no problem.  We'll get you up here.  All right, thanks a lot.  All right, man.  It's Rob from Arizona downstairs.  God damn it. 
[02:34:00]  Am I going to have to restart this?  What?  I'll restart the computer, and then, of course, we'll need a password.  God forbid.  They're weird.  Mine's not working either.  Oh, yours isn't either?  Yeah, all the computers are a little strange today for some reason.  So no pal talk.  Cagney died in 1986.  86.  I was just kidding with Minnelli because he said, I bought this a bunch of, about 15 years  ago, and he died.  It was many years after his death, and I said he died in 97.  Yeah.  97, when it meant the coat was a fraud.  Yeah, that was the best.  Anything to eat, Jake? 
[02:34:30]  No, thank you, Kenny.  All right, taser videos.  Tara Reid on Tyra.  We got lots of stuff to do on Tyra.  I actually bought the coat that Kennedy was shot in.  It cost me 1,500.  Two bullet holes in the back.  I don't think it's real.  Would you buy...  Chess King.  Would you buy stuff from a dead celebrity?  Sure.  Absolutely.  I'd buy something from Pryor.  Richard Pryor.  Rain Pryor.  Hopefully we can get into the show.  I'd love to buy something from his estate that he wore or something.  I would love to have a piece of him.  Maybe Kurt Cobain.  Maybe I'd go there. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, I guess.  It's usually...  Stuff like that, I find it ghoulish, people who just buy it to resell it.  But if you want a piece of somebody that you love, there's nothing wrong with that.  It's a little ghoulish.  Well, it depends on what it is.  If you want a piece of something they were murdered in, but to have Elvis' driver's license  is pretty cool.  A brand of his driver's license.  Why not?  Yeah.  I like movie memorabilia stuff.  Sure.  I would get stuff like that, but personal items, things like that.  Even driver's license or letters. 
[02:35:30]  People get letters.  I'd love that.  Unless it was something from World War II.  Orders.  Right, to Ava.  Things like that.  Yeah.  Maybe letters to Ava.  You know what?  This leads into a bit that we've been wanting to start up.  Stop.  Should we just do a day or a week, maybe?  The strangest thing or the most valuable thing you own?  Oh, well.  We've done this from...  Actually, it works better as strangest thing you own.  Remember, we've gotten some really interesting things over the years. 
[02:36:00]  I have to throw my cock on the table and throw all that fella's been through.  I'd best not get into this one.  Just perpetuate the stereotype.  This is the ear of an uncle who...  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, right?  All right, why don't we listen to Tara Reid on Tyra?  Dad!  Halloween, Tara!  Look at all the crazy costumes.  They're not some crazy costumes out there.  I know.  I love it.  You guys are great.  What were your favorite costumes when you were a kid for Halloween? 
[02:36:30]  God, I was everything.  I was Snow White.  I was Allison from Alice in Wonderland.  I was a witch.  I've been all kinds of stuff.  Yeah.  And do you dress up now, too?  I love dressing up.  It's one of my favorite things.  But one of the things I found out, actually, is...  Oh, my God.  Halloween, it was created to scare, like, all the ghosts away.  So whatever you dress up now as, it's supposed to give you your luck for the next year.  So if you dress up as the police, it might be like you're going to get in trouble and get arrested.  Or if you're, like, a nurse, you might get sick.  Oh, my gosh.  So you're supposed to dress in the outfit that you want the next year of your luck like. 
[02:37:00]  So what are you going to dress like tonight?  I'll probably be an angel.  So she ends up dead.  Why is that?  Non-cunt.  I want to be a really good girl.  Yeah.  I'll be great.  Everything nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it follows her logic.  That means she will be an angel in the coming year.  But if you dress as a nurse, wouldn't that mean you would be, like...  Taken care of?  Taken care of.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  For the year.  Like, I don't get her whole thing.  She said, you dress as a policeman.  It's terrible.  Then you won't get in trouble by the police because that's your luck for the year. 
[02:37:30]  But you're saying if you dress as a police officer, then you're protected the coming year, right?  It should be...  Yeah, with her logic, you should dress as horrific things.  Like, if you dress as the devil, then the devil won't be able to screw with you.  Or...  Like, I don't...  Her...  She makes no sense.  It's Tara Reid.  Thank you for...  You gotta keep telling me that.  Oh, my God.  I keep...  Forgetting who the hell you're talking about. 
[02:38:00]  What an idiot.  Hey, before we go any further, can we get Roland in here?  Roland, Roland, Roland.  I want to know why Flavor Flav was on that stage for 55 minutes Tuesday night.  I'm completely hijacking.  This is mine.  At a Halloween party.  What?  He's not here right now.  Why?  He's conveniently not here.  Oh, he's coming out here.  Wait a minute.  Where was his sweatshirt brought from?  Why?  I don't know.  What's wrong?  No, no, no.  I don't want to...  Whose is this?  No, no, no, no, no.  This is mine, right? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, I asked for a sweatshirt rolling off of me his.  I'm like, I can't wear yours because you're obviously a...  You sweat.  I had to wear my own.  It was here.  Thank you.  I used Snuckles.  Roland, sit down.  Snuckles.  You're cute.  What happened Tuesday night?  The listeners need to know.  With all the...  You know, well...  You know.  The show was hijacked by Flavor Flav.  Let's be honest.  We like Flavor Flav.  We don't like them for 55 minutes.  We like Flavor Flav for about seven minutes.  Yeah, I...  Yeah, because we was like two songs out and they gave me a list of 15 people max. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  So now that didn't seem that bad.  15 people max.  It's usually...  Two songs out.  All right.  It's like the Ryan Starr thing.  He brought his tour people.  See?  Now, Ryan Starr came out.  We spoke with him a little bit.  He got up on stage, did a tune or two, and was done.  And it worked out beautifully.  Yes.  Now, why did the Flav thing go so much differently in so much...  He all of a sudden had a thousand people, and then... 
[02:39:30]  Did he even know what show he was doing?  I...  Serious.  I don't...  I...  He did for a moment, and then after a few drinks, he didn't know what he was doing.  Never thanked us.  Never mentioned our names.  Like, you know...  Hey, ONA, thanks for having me.  It was like he thought it was his show.  At the Hard Rock.  And, yeah, we were just there to, what, intro him, I guess.  Yeah.  Did he have any idea this was being taped to broadcast? 
[02:40:00]  His manager did.  His manager did.  His manager and his publicist, Big Bone, I think, or...  His publicist's name is Big Bone?  Or Bone, yeah.  Well, who else would it be?  It was Bone something.  And he's a very large man who picked me up, like...  Yeah?  Yeah.  So I was like, eh.  He picked you up?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know, because I went by Flav, and he thought I was going to tackle.  Are you kidding me?  No, I went...  This Flav is getting a little, uh... 
[02:40:30]  Uppity.  Uppity.  Well, you don't look threatening.  Yeah.  I know.  I was like...  You're a marshmallow.  And a sweet boy.  Maybe that's why.  Too white.  A marshmallow with a small head.  What's going on with that?  Yeah.  Because he wanted the bigger dressing room, and I said no, and then...  Oh, and that's where it started.  You know, we gave up the big dressing room last year for Hulk Hogan, and we were like,  you know something?  We got a lot of people.  We're doing this show and stuff. 
[02:41:00]  We should get the big dressing room.  Yeah.  You are.  Yeah.  So this year, knowing that Flav, thinking that Flav was just going to be a quick guest  thing and do some stuff, we took the big dressing room.  And that might have started a problem right there, I think.  A part, but just like, it just, his people didn't convey to him.  It wasn't like, um...  People didn't convey to him.  Oh, my God.  Can I read off the list for Flavor Flav?  Please.  Oh, my God.  What's the list?  Um, it gets longer than that, though. 
[02:41:30]  This is a partial list.  Partial guest list?  I have it on my Blackberry, too.  All right.  They handed this to one of the security guys at the Hard Rock Cafe.  List for Flavor Flav.  Clifton Johnson, manager.  Big John, security, plus two.  Eric, security.  Faze, F-A-Z-E, security.  Stephanie Wiener, plus one, from VH1.  Jennifer Bartok, plus two, a.k.a. D-Mix.  Nikki Strong, Nikki D, plus five.  Fat Farm, Melly Mel, Furious Five. 
[02:42:00]  Raheem, Furious Five.  Bow-Legged Lou in full force.  Bow-Legged Lou?  The Bow-Legged Lou.  All right.  Now you're talking.  Was Melly Mel there or no?  I don't think so.  He's on the list.  I don't remember saying no Melly Mel.  That's the list.  He wasn't there, though.  Bow-Legged Lou in full force.  Roxanne Shante, artist.  She wasn't there, either.  Spinderella from Salt-N-Pepa.  She was there.  Erica Mias from Candy Shop Video.  Patricia McNamee, Baby Fat.  Jasmine Izees, Sony Music. 
[02:42:30]  CB, Tough Guy Clothing.  Supreme Plus Two, Tough Guy Clothing.  DJ Webstar.  Busy B Starsky.  Remy Ma and Fat Joe.  Modest Jones.  Ratwatch.  Who's Flav's attorney.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  NG Bessim.  Another one of Flav's attorney.  Gilat Weeman.  Universal Records. 
[02:43:00]  Pebble Poo.  Pebble Poo, Anthony.  Pebble Poo.  Siobhan, Violator's manager.  Tito, Fielder's Four.  Tony Tone, Cold Crush Brothers.  J.C. Cruz.  Emma Ramos.  Ramos, I guess.  Tony Zios.  Tori Clayton.  Sal, Plus One.  Disco Fever.  And that's the partial list.  And Buckshot.  And Buckshot.  Buckshot made the show.  Wow. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  So you didn't know what happened.  No.  You got hijacked, too.  Yeah.  We're trying to get to the bottom of the problem.  No, and I tried to get them all out.  So I got more than half the entourage outside back into the stage area.  And then people all hated me for doing that.  Why?  I don't know.  The guy goes, do you know who I am?  I was like, I don't care.  I don't.  I don't care.  Yeah.  He said my enthusiasm was less than there.  I was like, I know. 
[02:44:00]  I was like, I know.  Sir Tall, African-American, Mexican man, don't kill me.  Yeah.  The guy was like six, seven or something, his main guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big dude.  Now, who was supposed to convey to Flav what his responsibilities were for the evening?  His manager.  Now, who was supposed to convey to the manager?  It was me.  I told the manager, like, backstage to go over everything. 
[02:44:30]  I go, can't talk to Flav real quick, because usually if you talk to the talent, they don't  know half the stuff.  And he goes, you can't.  He goes, Flav waves me off.  I was like, whatever.  I don't care.  Flav waves you off?  You know, let me say this now that we're on airwaves where I can talk.  Fuck Flav.  Fuck him and his fucking ass.  I am sick of these motherfuckers like this.  The guy blows off Ope's girlfriend for a picture.  Blows off other people for pictures.  He's there like he's the star of the fucking show. 
[02:45:00]  He was on our show once.  He's a fucking rap has-been who should count his blessings that VH1 has given him a fucking  show.  That'll be done.  Believe me.  Well, the show's over.  The novelty is already worn off.  Yeah.  The novelty's fucking gone.  Everyone knows it's a fake farce.  Fuck him.  Fuck his posse.  I think it was the manager more than him.  No.  No.  Fuck him.  I think, but I don't-  They asked Flav.  Did your girlfriend ask Flav for a picture?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Flav himself. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  And Flav said no.  Yeah.  Fuck Flav or Flav.  Because he didn't want to take pictures of white girls.  Don't care.  Because someone else called in.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  And on my drive home without a mic, I'll say a little more.  Can I tell the manager, I go, two songs.  I go, if they're short, I go, I know how sometimes it merges into a third song.  I go, that's the max.  He goes, don't worry.  I think he only did three songs.  It wasn't the songs that was the problem.  Yeah.  It was the babbling about introducing people no one gave a shit about.  Well, I did tell the manager why he was introducing them. 
[02:46:00]  I said, can you wrap it up?  And he just looked at me and he goes, oh, no.  No.  No.  I think he was afraid to tell Flav, too.  Wrap it up.  How is your manager fucking afraid of you like that?  I don't know.  You know something?  Reuben Kincaid used to tell those Partridges, everything.  Yeah, but.  Was not afraid of the Partridge family.  That thing is, I don't.  No?  What?  No, I don't.  I hear what you said.  No, I said just the manager, I think, was the one that probably didn't convey everything  to Flav.  And I'll bet you the manager never told him half the stuff Roland is saying. 
[02:46:30]  And the manager told him not to take pictures with white girls?  No, no, I'm not talking about that.  I'm not talking about him not being a dick there.  Yeah.  But I'm talking about just, I'm talking about the show only.  Not him being a dick in his personal life.  I'm saying with that, though, it sounds like the manager was afraid to tell him anything.  But you know something?  As a fucking entertainer.  I do.  I completely agree.  You should have a sheet given to you, to you personally, not your fucking people, of  what the night's events are and how they're timed out.  We wound up getting them. 
[02:47:00]  Everyone that we know got those sheets, what time things are going to happen.  And hey, Flav, here's your fucking...  Forget about what a big star you are and how your manager's scared of you and how you got  70 fucking people around you.  Here's the sheet of paper that tells when you go on and when you're done.  They could like write a star.  He goes, okay, what do I do?  He goes, yeah, songs.  They'll talk to you for a few minutes.  And now he goes, done.  It's not the fucking early 90s.  Can we get Flav on the phone today?  Get him on the phone.  I could try with a manager.  He's in L.A. right now.  He doesn't wake up before noon. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, well, sorry.  Wake him up.  Let's get the manager on the phone.  Yeah, get that manager on the phone.  Get one of the 80 people that were on stage on the phone.  Just not those two security guys.  Get his mother on the phone.  Yeah, just not the security guys, I'm afraid.  Let's say hi to Roger in Cleveland.  Roger.  Doors are locked, aren't they?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just want to say amen.  Well, you know, I didn't quite put it in those terms.  Wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[02:48:00]  Jesus.  Let's go to Mike in Philly.  Mike.  Jesus subconscious.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Was that a call?  He had that CD coming out on Tuesday that his people probably just led him to believe  that this was, like, his album release party?  You know what, dude?  It was an audience release party.  Jesus Christ, they fled.  This guy raised the perfect fucking point.  He went to some merchandise, but John at the Hard Rock was like, no.  That was probably what he thought this was.  I mean, look, the final line is this.  Oh, brother.  He's probably drunk. 
[02:48:30]  No one explained it to him.  I guarantee nobody explained it to him.  He thought it was a record release party.  This was his coming out.  Why else would you bring Chuck D, and here's what tells you that, to an Opie and Anthony  party, you don't mention Opie and Anthony.  Look, he's probably out of there because he parties, but he's not a dope.  He understands business.  He's got his own show.  He does promotion for the show.  I mean, there's a certain protocol you go through to fucking make your show bigger.  So he knows that. 
[02:49:00]  Why else would he bring Chuck D out at an Opie and Anthony event?  He could do that at a 97.1 or BET event and have 5,000 people going ballistic.  You know what?  Well, they wanted him there.  The only person that didn't know that it wasn't a record release party was Flavor Flav.  That's why I'm not shitting on Flav.  Because all the people were coming out, and I love observing things.  That's one of my favorite things in the world to do. 
[02:49:30]  It's an art form to me.  I just love it, okay?  As these people were on stage, I was watching them looking at the audience, and they were  all like, what the?  What is going on?  They were all like, what is going on here?  The only one that didn't notice was Flav.  Because what he was doing, he was bringing out his family.  Because for him, releasing a solo album was a big deal.  Chuck D had told him for years to release one, apparently.  And he had just been afraid, or he wasn't comfortable, whatever.  This is a big moment for him.  My solo album is finally coming out. 
[02:50:00]  I got my fans here.  My hometown.  I'm going to bring my family out.  It's going to be a whole event.  Like, this is a big night for me.  He didn't realize that this was just an Opie and Anthony thing.  He was doing a couple songs.  Well, then.  He had no idea.  It was just a guest spot.  A real quick guest spot.  So then, who fucked us?  That's why I'm...  Who purposefully fucked our show?  I don't...  Well, I'm going to jump in.  I don't think the manager would purposefully do it, because...  Only because it wasn't good for them either.  Someone had to know what the real deal was and then not convey it. 
[02:50:30]  Someone on purpose...  There's one link in this fucking chain, and I use the chain analogy with a little bit of humor.  There's a link in this chain that broke down.  Somebody knew...  All the people up to a certain point knew what this was and what this event was supposed to be and what his capacity there was supposed to be.  And then it broke, and some people up the line were not told what this was.  It was a guest on our show.  I think it could be, like, somebody in the management camp. 
[02:51:00]  And that person fucked us on purpose to get more fucking, whatever I'm looking for the word, more mileage out of that event for Flav than he should have gotten.  You might be right about that.  Although, I think if they were going to fuck someone purposely, they would...  To bring out Chuck...  You know what?  You might be right.  Only because...  Why wouldn't they do it with BET or even a network...  It just makes me laugh every time. 
[02:51:30]  Why wouldn't they do it somewhere?  It should have been in the heart of Harlem.  It's the worst fucking show you could pick.  It should have been at the Apollo.  For an African-American artist to come on and plug his shit is our show.  Our hardcore listeners were like, what the hell is going on?  It would be like sending...  Give me a great example of someone to send over to one of the hip-hop stations.  Axl Rose.  Like Karani.  No, even Axl.  Neil Diamond. 
[02:52:00]  Black people even like...  Neil fucking Diamond.  Black people do know Axl.  There you go.  No, more black people like Neil Diamond than like Axl Rose.  No, that's rock.  Even Axl.  Slash is fucking half black.  So there's even more of a tie in there than there was with the O&A show.  And they know Axl's a bad boy.  Everyone knows like Guns N' Roses.  Prussian Blue.  Those cute little girls that sing Nazi songs.  I'm a boy fan.  Good one.  Fan knows.  He's a good boy.  Honestly, what you're looking at...  I'm a Jew hater.  If you really want to go... 
[02:52:30]  What you should say is a...  Being redundant.  What you should say is a white country artist.  Yeah.  Travis Tritt.  Travis Tritt at the hip-hop station.  Then you'd be on to something.  You got the country.  There you go.  A white country artist.  And now Hot 97 here in New York is bringing on the Dixie Chicks to perform and talk and  bring up and mention all their family and beliefs.  And that's how that was.  They might like the Dixie Chicks because they trashed Bush and caught shit for it. 
[02:53:00]  They might be giving a free pass.  You got to get some old school country guy.  Where you know...  Lyle Lovett.  Where you know he writes...  Lyle Lovett.  Who's the guy that's saying, Hal Snick stole her to me?  That guy.  You need an old school country guy that writes some different songs for his friends.  Merle Haggard or something.  That never make the stage.  Here's my point.  Look at how hard we're trying to come up with a great example that equals how awkward  it was to have him on that stage on our show doing that. 
[02:53:30]  Can I ask you a question?  Why didn't we stop it?  Because as white people, we were a little afraid of what might happen.  What might transpire.  The snowballing chain of events that might have happened between security.  Because he felt entitled.  His security people and all those people that were on stage with him had this entitlement  that this is Flav.  You don't fuck with him.  You let him finish.  Part of us, plus none of us knew what the fuck was happening. 
[02:54:00]  When he first came out and he talked a little bit.  You're watching a guy perform.  You don't know if he's going to get into music.  Right.  So you're not too sure what's going on.  Hi-oh.  He was like, all right.  Working the crowd like we've seen hip-hop guys do.  So then he walks off.  He's going to come back.  Okay, man.  He just came out and said hello.  That was kind of cool.  He didn't just hide in the dressing room.  The crowd was cool, actually.  Yeah, it was fine.  He was setting up a nice segment where he'd come back out and we're like, hey, here's  Flav.  We didn't even get to introduce the guy because he, oh, whatever. 
[02:54:30]  Because you didn't know what he was going to do.  The bottom line was people were kind of like, all right, we've got a guy performing.  He's a celebrity performer.  You didn't know how long it was going to go on.  We didn't have almost the benefit of hindsight.  But it was like, what the fuck is he doing?  And then we all knew Chuck D was there.  So we're like, all right, well, they're going to, you know, it's like a public enemy  reunion to a certain degree.  That's a pretty cool thing.  None of us knew what the fuck was really going on.  There were two moments.  I'm a real faggot coward.  Can I get the Anthony line again?  Do we have that?  There were two great moments.  Anthony trying to bring Flav into our world. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, it was like.  Because at this point, it was like, well, hello, we are trying to do a radio show here.  I mean, you know, you got to come into our world here.  Like, we want to talk to you and interview you a little bit.  I figured it would get his attention and then we could bring him over and  actually talk to him.  So Ant made a quick joke and, boy, he wasn't, he wasn't, he didn't want to hear no joke.  He didn't even take it as a joke.  He was, here's what, he didn't realize the radio show he was doing.  He was in studio once, on the phone once.  He was very cool and fun both times.  He was a great in studio guest. 
[02:55:30]  And he was great on the phone, too.  Yes.  Someone's saying, did Ant say Flav's music was okay for hip hop and what he was doing?  It sounded great.  The guy was working the turntables, doing a great job.  Flav sounded good as far as hip hop going.  He was singing along to the record.  Him and Chuck D.  Yeah, I'm not, yeah, he was singing along to the record.  Him and Chuck D. were great together.  Yeah, that shit was cool.  I enjoyed it.  If it was just that and then him coming over and sitting and saying a few words and leaving,  it would have been fine.  I had no problem with the singing part of it, the rapping part, whatever the fuck you want 
[02:56:00]  to call it.  I had a problem with 50 people on the stage and every one of them having to be personally  introduced and him just babbling to the crowd during our radio show.  This is what Anthony, this is what Anthony attempted to bring Flavor Flav into our world  and it's just, it was hilarious, Anthony, but it did no good.  Yo, check this out, y'all.  I just want to say, too, for the first time ever in my life, you've been in front of this 
[02:56:30]  many white people.  Wrong.  You know what, Ant getting a massive laugh.  It broke the tension because everyone was, at that point, was kind of like, oh boy, when  is this going to end?  Because he kept going, you know what, let me tell you something again, another something.  Yeah, so it broke the tension.  I was hoping that would then, you know, he'd turn around and he'd go, come here or something.  Right.  Change it up a little.  Or do one of those Flavor Flav laughs with the... 
[02:57:00]  No, there was no laughs.  There was nothing.  It was a serious Flav.  Which shows that he didn't want to, like, you know, he didn't want to be part of our...  I say fuck him.  Yeah.  Now fuck him.  Yo, check this out, y'all.  I just want to say, too, for the first time ever in my life...  You've been in front of this many white people.  Wrong.  Hey, yo.  Can I tell you something?  Huge laugh.  Hey, yo, can I tell y'all something? 
[02:57:30]  He's wrong, because I've been in front of Moorwood when I was on tour with you, too.  Y'all need to know that.  But I love you anyway, though.  Why would he have to go there, man?  It was a great line.  Let it just sit.  Because he had to kind of, you know, get back.  Did he laugh after he said that?  Listen to that again.  Not really, man.  Like, it was almost like an awkward...  Almost like you want to laugh.  Because I saw a player do stand-up comedy one time with Caroline, and he bombed horribly.  It was almost like he was trying to be funny. 
[02:58:00]  He got like...  Like, almost like saying, hey, man, you've never been in front of this many black people.  And I was caught up.  And I go, yeah, I was when I was...  Even if it was true, like...  I think he was getting to a point.  Like, he was going, let me just tell you something, man.  Never in my life.  There was something heavy about to come.  Heavy?  No, no.  I'm just...  In his mind.  I'm going with his mind.  Oh, okay.  He's about to say something, and he gets...  And he does it interrupted by, like, an anonymous voice.  There's a bunch of white guys on a panel.  Yeah, how do you think...  The manager... 
[02:58:30]  It was on an auction block.  It was a panel.  It was on our show.  I don't think he was afraid, but I think his whole group was uncomfortable.  Like, his family is like, what the fuck?  There's a bunch of white guys with microphones behind them.  There's a white audience.  There's a guy dressed like a cock standing there.  There's fucking tender sentiments.  There's fucking chicks showing their tits.  Even worse than that, he got no filter, Paul, and blackface.  Blackface with a corner on his neck.  And his fucking mother's being introduced.  And the security guys are scanning the crowd.  They're probably...  They're like, what the fuck is going on?  He produces his daughters to a show your tits chant. 
[02:59:00]  Show your tits.  This is not what we got ourselves...  His group...  And I'm not talking about the fringe fucks that came in behind them.  The 50 people that came in behind them.  I'm saying the big group that they had...  He had guys like Kaz, Raheem, Dana Dane, who I wanted to meet.  That's an old school rap guy.  Nobody is going into a completely fucking Opie and Anthony white venue and mentioning the name Dana Dane.  Dana Dane wouldn't do it.  He'd pretend he's somebody else that people would know.  He hasn't been very famous since the 80s.  No. 
[02:59:30]  It just was a complete fucking miscommunication.  You don't bring guys from the Furious Five to an Opie and Anthony party and introduce them.  I was happy to hear they were there.  I was thrilled.  You don't bring those guys to an O&A party.  Flave is not that out of it that he would make that decision before him.  It's one for the ages.  It really is.  Because Hunt or High 97 later that night wanted...  They interviewed Flave and they saw Chuck D.  They go, can you come in?  He goes, no.  Chuck's doing no interviews, but they may do something special. 
[03:00:00]  They go, for us?  They're like, no.  For somebody else.  That's what Andrew told me.  He probably thought that this was his coming out record party.  It's the hard rock.  He's doing a record.  That's why I'm not...  Again, I don't like the fact he didn't take a picture with Lindsay.  I would love to know exactly what transpired there.  Can you take a picture with you and Chuck?  He was fine with me.  It's something about white girls.  Because we had another listener say that he loves his girlfriend.  Yeah, I don't understand why that is.  Whatever.  But it's whatever.  I'm not going to shit on him for the party thing.  Because I really think that he... 
[03:00:30]  I mean, look, dude, when you have a big...  Your own solo album.  Is that where you would want to fucking announce your solo record?  Is that where you want to perform with Chuck D?  In front of 300 fucking white people?  Because tickets weren't distributed properly?  One dressed like Hitler also.  Like Hitler?  What?  Hitler a pun.  You suck!  A Hitler, a big cock, and someone in black.  How would you feel if you walked into a bunch of fucking fat white guys  trying to make themselves throw up with candy?  What about Neil completely naked? 
[03:01:00]  What about Tippi Tom completely drunk?  Is that the place you want?  Is that the place?  Where you want to talk about your record dropping?  Yeah.  And you bring your mom out.  His family was there.  This was, Mom, come down.  Oh, boy.  Bring the kids.  This is my night.  My record's coming out.  Yeah.  This is my night.  The rape victim girl costume was next to his daughters.  Yeah.  Show your tits to his mother and his daughters.  He thought Chrissy was going to be flowing and P. Diddy was going to be there. 
[03:01:30]  He had no idea what the fuck was going on.  Bunch of hoes.  The hard rock in Times Square on Halloween.  That's going to be my record drop.  Yeah.  Chuck D is going to be there.  We're going to fuck.  Oh, it's going to be.  The wheels of steel.  Do you understand how fucked he got in this whole thing?  He did ramble, but he'd probably been drinking a little.  He babbled.  He probably walked out originally.  He probably walked out originally, saw the fact that the only black face was no filter  Paul, and said, let me talk to the crowd and go get fucking loaded. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, perhaps.  Dude, he got fucked too.  Not on purpose.  I don't know.  I don't like the fact he blew off anybody.  Someone in his chain of command broke the line of communication.  Absolutely.  They were probably too scared to tell him.  They were probably starting to tell him.  They said, wow, great, I'll do the record, and they weren't able to continue the explanation  of what was supposed to go down, and then everyone was like, ugh, it's a runaway train  at this point.  We might as well let it just happen. 
[03:02:30]  Getting suggestions that perhaps next year we get Hell's Angels for security, and then  if we have any problems, they could take care of it on stage.  Let them do the splaining.  Right.  Well, let's go to Arch Stanton.  Arch Stanton.  Okay, Arch Stanton, what's up?  That's a famous grave.  Hey, guys, how are you?  I don't know.  Actually amazed that they didn't fall off, and it was all on the media.  Main reason?  Because Flav is older, and his group was older.  The guys, those security guys he was with were not 20-year-old guys. 
[03:03:00]  They were probably like 35-year-old dudes, 40-year-old dudes.  They had been with him a while.  He had older people with him.  I'm telling you, if that was like the game or fucking Lloyd Banks or somebody like that  with a young group around him, that could have been a major fucking problem.  Look at some of the pictures.  I see some young guys in that group that looked pretty intimidating, like they were ready to  kick some ass.  But also Flav's mother was there, his daughters, his son.  I mean, he had family there. 
[03:03:30]  I'm telling you, that diffused things.  I'm telling you.  They were packing.  That made things a lot easier.  He was probably a pistol.  The other thing we failed to mention, all those people that were on stage with Flavor  Flav, they all had cameras and video.  They had their camera phones on, their video cameras, because this was a big moment.  Big event.  They were told it's a big moment.  All they're going to see are a bunch of white faces.  Did you see, after he was done performing with Chuck T, they did a photo op on the stage  with the family and Chuck and the old rapper.  This was a big coming together party.  Oh, Christ.  What the fuck, do you think they wanted that in front of a bunch of fucking Opie and Anthony 
[03:04:00]  fan white people?  Do you think this was ideal for them, that every fucking photo they take has me and you  and fucking Colin and stupid fat Bob Kelly and Otto?  And a guy dressed as a penis.  I just as a cock and balls.  From their point of view, do you think that he planned on his...  This is his big moment, and in the photo is no filter, all in black.  And his fucking Otto with the puppet's brain showing, bopping to the beat. 
[03:04:30]  Do you think that's what he planned?  You gotta look at both sides here.  Oh, it gets funnier and funnier.  Fucking Neo completely naked with his dick tucked between his legs.  Just a bunch of white disasters.  Stupid, tender sentiments box.  What the fuck does that mean?  Yeah, his big moment.  Dude, his family was there for a photo op on stage.  This was a major thing for him.  Go up, go up. 
[03:05:00]  Now I'm getting, you know, just to go with Jimmy's thought here.  I'm looking at some of the costumes.  Here's a guy dressed as a flasher with a huge cock.  And a pimp.  A guy in a purple shirt with a purple shirt.  There's the guy with the Nazi armband.  Steve from Bayshore dressed as a Nazi.  Is this what he wanted to see as he's fucking dropping his record?  Paris and baby girl fucking licking each other in the front.  Making out right up front.  Happy typing girl not even jumping in to stop it.  Just a fucking debauchery. 
[03:05:30]  What about Anthony in a wizard's robe on stage?  Well, how about a guy?  You know, if that was white.  If my wizard robe was white.  Yeah, dude, you know, I'm surprised.  I almost look like a grand wizard.  I was going to say, you dress like that.  I'm surprised he didn't introduce you to the crowd.  I know what it looks like.  I know.  You almost look like one.  And you'd certainly think like one if you took your views down a notch.  A fucking guy dressed like George Harrison with pudding on his head to mock brain cancer.  Old pudding head.  They're the lovely ladies. 
[03:06:00]  Is this the audience you want to perform in front of?  Look at this.  They're my fans, and I don't want to perform in front of them.  Naughty nurses.  Dude, this is not what Flay had in mind for his fucking coming out party.  And he brought those free gifts, too, to give out.  Oh, you nailed it.  They had like a free gift of a play of CD.  They never get it out.  Oh, something happened.  Like they threw one box out.  And they realized it wasn't the crowd.  The crowd was just.  Yeah.  The crowd like threw it back or something.  Here's Sergeant Magoo.  Sergeant Magoo.  Hey, boys. 
[03:06:30]  How you doing this morning?  Hey.  All right.  Well, I think the clue that should have tipped him off that it wasn't his crowd is when he  gets introduced on stage where there's a bunch of us white boys in our underwear  with glue traps stuck all over our bodies.  Yeah, true.  That's when he decided to walk out.  When a bunch of the white boys were half naked with glue traps stuck all over their hairy  bodies.  And he decides, yeah, boy.  Finally, here's my moment.  First time performing in New York in years. 
[03:07:00]  Blindfolded girls pulling rubber dicks out of water and cow parts.  Yeah, this is my coming out party.  Yeah.  Yeah, boy.  Oh, my record's dropping.  Yo, my record's dropping.  Look at the pictures.  Go to Wack Bag.  There's Flavor Flav on stage with the guys in glue traps.  And somebody tried slapping a glue trap on him.  Right.  Remember when someone tried slapping a glue trap on Flav and he goes, no, don't do that.  Don't put none of that shit on me.  Oh, God. 
[03:07:30]  One for the ages.  Yeah, man.  This was an abortion.  Every time we try to do something like this, it just goes horribly wrong.  Please get to the pictures of me, Opie, and Jimmy.  They're separate shots, but they're pretty much three in a row.  About 20 or 30 minutes in.  Well, Roland.  Our faces are disgusted.  See next year if you can get fucking maybe Irv Gotti and Murders Incorporated or fucking  50 Cent to perform at our Christmas party.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:08:00]  Thank God he's older.  Thank God Flav is an older guy and Chuck D is an older guy and they're not young, violent  fucking loons or they would have been a major problem.  Yeah, I'm surprised we didn't have them.  There were a few problems.  There were a few minor ones, but I'm telling you, his guys, because they're older, are a  bit more restrained.  A bit more restrained.  They could have got a lot worse than that.  Without a doubt.  One missing pocket book.  I feel bad for the lady, but.  That's terrible.  And his guys, the older guys he was with, were not grabbing asses. 
[03:08:30]  Those guys were all back there with him.  I'm saying the guys that were with him.  Older guys that were with him.  There were people on the stage, though, that I saw.  Go to one of these pictures.  Leah, here's a few.  Look at our faces.  Dude, I swear.  Go back.  Let me see.  This is where I'm looking at Opie and going, uh, dude.  And Dan's over us.  What do you want to do?  Dan's looking.  And I go, obviously nothing.  And I'm looking at Opie like, what?  Dude, how long is this going to go on?  Do you understand?  There was a guy that walked out, and I mean this.  I thought it was Dick Gregory that was with him.  There was a guy that was older people. 
[03:09:00]  Probably people he grew up in his neighborhood with.  Guys that, like, you know, were, like, the older people in his neighborhood.  Oh, here's, uh.  Yeah, look at some of the people now.

Dude, none of us knew what was going on.  It wasn't, it wasn't like, we're like, all right, he should, like, after a while, once  the pictures, you're like, what the fuck was happening? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  What happened?  I tried to wrap it up, like, after that.  Oh, God.  It's one of those things that kept going on and on, and you're thinking, all right, it's  gotta end soon.  And then it didn't.  And then you go, all right, we'll see how long it goes, and it didn't end, and.  We're just taking a break.  Roland's a sweet boy, but he's not a take charge guy.  You're a sweet man, but you don't, you're not a guy that people, because Roland, you'll  walk in and go, uh, we supposed to, and they'll go, what?  We needed, like, WWF guys to walk up and just.  Here's a great picture.

Just shows you how white the audience was.  It's our pal Anthony doing Sweet Caroline.  Oh.  This is the same crowd that was listening to Flavor Flav.  Do you think.  If this doesn't say it all. 
[03:11:00]  Do you think.  Don't make me laugh.  That he wanted to fucking have his solo.  He was with Public Enemy.  Right.  First time ever he does a fucking solo album.  Do you think he wants some fucking radio guy doing Sweet Caroline to get a bigger applause  than the fucking Public Enemy shit he's doing?  By the way.  He wanted to follow Sweet Caroline.  In full wizard regalia.  I was in full wizard regalia.  The crowd he was hoping for would have shot you before note two.  Yo, Chuck's the one that talked me into doing this, yo. 
[03:11:30]  Yo, what's he doing out there?  Sweet what?  And it was karaoke too.  Yeah.  He followed karaoke.  Karaoke version.  It just, it couldn't have been a more awful night for him.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  His record, his record release party was a horrid bomb.  Good.  Someone is saying this is why you have to keep broadcasting these abortions.  I laughed all day yesterday thinking about it. 
[03:12:00]  You know, the more you pick it apart, the fucking funnier it gets.  Oh, yeah.  Because then we had to follow that.  We were just tired.  We just wanted to go home.  We had to still do the costume party.  The costume contest.  Yeah, costume contest.  We were just like, we were beaten, man.  Well, here's the same audience that Flavor Flav performed in front of.  This is Anthony doing Sweet Caroline.  In wizard suit.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  I want to welcome you all here tonight to the Halloween party.

[03:17:00]  With your dates?  Very good  Let's say hi to BMO from Connecticut  BMO, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey, listen  Oh, I just wanted to know  Like the day of  You had like a real problem in the bathroom there  How'd you hold on to that?  Did you put one of the toys into the dunking bucket?  Well, I was bragging at dinner  I mean, it was Jim's big night last night  After the letterman appearance  We went down to this fine restaurant  For some Italian food  And the dinner conversation was me talking about 
[03:17:30]  Honestly, Jim, now that I think about it  It was more than 18 inches  It was about a 20-inch  Shit  Well, what in your thought process made you go  Like, how did you rethink that and go  Wait a minute, there's two more inches I missed  Yeah, hold it  Let me think  Because I was like visualizing  Like, I didn't really take into account  What was like, you know, underneath  You know how you tell?  You measure from the tail to the dorsal  Eyes like a doll  Yeah 
[03:18:00]  Alright, BMO, thanks  No, yesterday morning  It was at least 20 inches  One piece  This thick around  You ever pull a big log out  And then put it under your nose  Like it's a mustache  And run around kissing people?  Mustachioed  I was very proud of what I emptied out of my bow  My bow  Wow  Yesterday morning  How could you tell?  Because it had to have cracked  It didn't crack  It stayed like what?  Soft serve?  I was so bummed out  Spiral or sticking out of the bowl? 
[03:18:30]  I was so bummed out  I didn't have a digital camera  It went like  It was wrapped up  Like it was like a snake  Oh, gotcha  And I actually poked that a little bit  Because I was amazed  That it was in one piece  So I kind of moved the top part  Oh, you poked at it  Well, not with my  Like with toilet paper  I just had to move it around  Oh, God  Because I was amazed  That this was in one piece  You don't see one like that every day  So I wanted to like  Take it all out  You know  But that wasn't the  The worst conversation  We had last night 
[03:19:00]  Freaking one of Jim's  Managers  Is a psychopath  Jonathan  I told you he's crazy  The stories he was telling  He went to West Africa  Yeah  He went to West Africa by himself  And drove cross country  Why?  Dude  We should have him on one time  That's how you end up  Hacked apart  With a rusty machete  He's a very bright guy  He's a really smart dude  And he's a very interesting guy  He likes to travel  And he can talk about anything  And he has all this weird knowledge  He's been to Jakarta  I mean  He's a fucking kook, man 
[03:19:30]  He's wow  I told him  He's either an arms dealer  Or is he looking for a beheading  They'll find him dead  Somewhere  Yeah  Yeah  What did we say at dinner  You know  We wanted him to take care of himself  Because we didn't want to go to a wake  Where I said only his head is there  And then Jimmy goes  No actually  It would only be his watch  With like  Like a piece of DNA on it  Yeah  So just nothing left  A blood flick  Right  But he's telling stories  About security  And African stuff  And how he had 
[03:20:00]  He got on a plane  With like a  Like a whole bag of knives  That he was  Wanted to bring back  To the states  And they didn't check the bag  They checked him  Through security  But they didn't check the bag  And they said  You're okay to go  No they don't care  And he looked  And he was like  But  And then he didn't want  To say anything  So he just picked up  His bag of knives  And got on the plane  They don't care over there  And he was telling us  How old the planes are  And how you buy  A ticket to go to  Like one city in Africa  And you assume it's  You know  It's non-stop  But the plane stops  Like ten times  Picks up people 
[03:20:30]  Picks up people  As it goes  The stories he was telling  Were just really  Really interesting  He's been a Timbuktu  How's first class  On those flights  I bet  It's good  You have to actually  Fly the plane  He has a story  He told me too  About how he tried  To bribe a guy  At a border  In Africa somewhere  By giving him a pen  But the guy was insulted  Because his bribe  Wasn't good enough  And Jonathan's had  Some weird shit  Like he's avoided jail  A few times  In these places  Just by weird  Little local things  That you don't know  I mean  Yeah that's just it  Like how would you know  What to say 
[03:21:00]  What not to say  Like that guy  Insulted by the bribe  Could have just killed him  Right there  Because that's what you do  When you're insulted  By a bribe  You kill the guy  It's an insult  Like how do you know  That doesn't happen  Dude he just has  This way about him  He's got a picture  Of it looks like  Idi Amin  Like he's  Like a president  Of one of these countries  In Africa  In a car  That wasn't just one  With Patrice  No that would be  Idiot  I mean  No it's  Jonathan's obsessed  With Idi Amin 
[03:21:30]  He showed me  This Idi Amin documentary  He goes  It's really funny  The stuff Idi Amin  He does  None of it's funny  It's funny  It's the barbarism  Of a dictator  Yeah  But he thinks  It's really funny  The little weird things  Idi Amin says  He's obsessed  With Idi Amin  He like  He mocked  A photograph  Of Idi Amin  And he signed it  And put it on his desk  He's a goof  He's truly insane  Yeah we gotta get him  On the show soon  The stories he was  He was telling last night  Were crazy  He's the guy  That goes to bat  For me with networks  Yeah  Fucking  He's out of his fucking mind  And the balls  In the front of his pants  I don't know what it is

[03:36:00]  And it's  It's all lumpy  She got destroyed  Like they pushed fat around  You want to like  Just play the last  Couple clips of this  Yeah let's hear  What she's talking about  What's  She's got a really bad  Boob job as well  Sorry  Yeah she had to go back  Trying to like save money  Or something  I don't know  I think they discuss  That in this clip here  The first surgery I had  I went to the very first surgeon  I saw  Which you're not supposed to do  I mean you know  I didn't do my research  One of the things  That people need to know  Is that  You don't have to be 
[03:36:30]  A board certified plastic surgeon  In America  To give surgery  Like a dentist  Could give it to you  Or string  And that's a crazy law  That's not  You know legal  Not legal  Well you are a tararee  Don't you have people around you  Who could look up  Yeah  Doctors you fucking Hollywood idiot  Or all that  Just ask your friends  Ask the ones that have nice tits  Where'd you get them done  My ex-girlfriend could tell you  She's had them done twice  You know you could go to a dentist  Would you  Right  You know  You idiot  I would cross that off my list 
[03:37:00]  If I was a chick looking for boobs  You said well you can get it from a dentist  No I don't think so  That story over the weekend  Or what not  The past couple of days  That 18 year old girl  Got her nipple pierced  And it got infected  She had to have her left tit removed  The whole tit  She was four hours away from being dead  When she finally went to the hospital  It was spreading that fast  This infection  How long did she have the infection for  And she said it was a while  A few weeks  And it was hurting 
[03:37:30]  So she finally went  And the doctor  You know  Now she's laying there  Her mother's there with her  And the doctor goes  Here's your choice  Four hours she's going to be dead  Or I got to remove her left breast  Oh that's terrible  And 18  Boom  Got to cut off her tit  The whole thing?  Whole thing  Oh boy  They showed the CAT scan of her chest  And you just saw one tit  You know which I guess looks normal  Under a CAT scan  And then the other one was just full of black  Wow  And boom  So there she is  Oh and the black was the infection right? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah  Black was the infection  We were supposed to get Tara Reid on the show  Oh it's terrible  Oh my god  I love Roland  He's like  He offers all these guests  And we say yes to it  And they never show  But we get the other ones  But we get the other ones  Right  He actually sent out an email the other day  Asking if we wanted Jimmy Carter on the show  Yeah no  We'd rather not have Jimmy Carter  Who would want to talk to an ex-president  Jimmy Carter  I'm sure Jimmy Carter will come in  Because you think showing tits is hilarious  While he's an ex-president  Building homes for the homeless  I have lusted in my heart  There are so much 
[03:38:30]  He's done that  So maybe he'll  No  No  When Roland  Roland sends these emails for these people  I don't even respond  Because I'm like  We're not getting that person  We're not getting Jimmy Carter on this show  How about this Roland  If it's an ex-president  Or a current president  I never thought I'd have to say this  Yeah  Book all presidents  Every single president  Can come in  He's going to appear on the same show  Where  When we're having a slow day  Jimmy Farson  To a microphone  Yeah  Let's be honest here  Can we even say this  That if an ex-president 
[03:39:00]  Wants to come on this program  Yeah  He can come in  Without even us knowing  In the middle of whatever we're doing  That's right  Or a current president  Because Roland  I say that  Well of course  Hopefully it's during  You know  Big A  Getting his face squirted  Why not  By some stripper broad  Sure  Wouldn't that be great  Speaking of rights  This is fantastic  We have to mention it again  We have to mention it  Every year  Until we retire  Oh 
[03:39:30]  The most uncomfortable moment  One of the most uncomfortable moments  In our radio careers  They're about to do  This is yesterday's paper I guess  Why would you have today's  No it's  Why would it be in today's  Maybe I saw yesterday I guess  Did you see it yesterday  Why would yesterday's paper be here  E-Rock  Anthony  Exactly  It is that time of year  They are doing Hungerthon again  Oh we remember that  And it listed all the stations  And we're back in  With the CBS family  Uh huh  And they're not doing it 
[03:40:00]  Over at Free FM  Now that's interesting  Are they doing it at  N.E.W.?  They're doing it there  They're doing it at  Oh  At  See but I thought  I thought they weren't doing it  At N.E.W.  Because when we were there  They didn't do it at N.E.W.  But they did it over  Yeah  At 92.3  Yeah we're the problem  So now we are at 92.3  And they're doing it over  At N.E.W.  But not at  I see  Seeing a little pattern here  See there's been a couple  Incidents in our careers  Yeah  Where we noticed that  Charities  Would rather not 
[03:40:30]  Work with us  Would rather not help the people  Well  Would rather not help  Yeah the people  They're trying to help  If it involves us  They would rather like  Have kids die of cancer  That was the case in Boston  Yeah the Jimmy Fund  The Jimmy Fund  Was supposed to be  Our big charity  For our CD  That we put out  Didn't take our money  And because of our reputation  They said  No we do not want to take  Free money  To help the cancer kids  From Opie and Anthony  You know that money  May have actually  Saved a child  Yeah  There could be a child 
[03:41:00]  That's dead  Because they didn't  Want to take our money  That's one thing  I've learned  That there are actually  The charities out there  Get picky  As far as where  Their donations  Are coming from  I had no idea  I thought if you're a charity  You'll take it from wherever  If Osama bin Laden  All of a sudden  Had a heart one day  And decided he wanted  To give some money up  You as the charity  Would just accept that  Because in the end  You're helping  You know  Cancer kids or what have you  Well maybe that's a  Well I know  Well I had a dream  I went for the extreme  You know example there  Anthony 
[03:41:30]  And then  And then with the hunger thon  Yeah  With the priest there  Well the priest  That runs the thing  You know if he was  Dressed like a priest  That would be one thing  We would have known  We didn't know  He was dressed like  A regular guy  We didn't know  He was dressed like  A regular guy  In civvy clothing  And everything  And it was about hunger thon  I figured he was like  An aging hippie  Kind of guy  Just didn't help  In the hungry  By auctioning off  Rock memorabilia  Tickets to shows  He spends a whole year  Getting rock memorabilia  Yeah 
[03:42:00]  You know  He'll get  Eric Clapton  To sign a guitar  And then it goes on the radio  And maybe you hear  During one of the breaks  Hey we're taking bids now  For Clapton's  Autographed guitar  For a hunger thon  It's a huge success  Raises a lot of money  For a hunger thon  For I guess  The New York homeless  Yeah  I think it's mostly  For the New York homeless  And it's run by  Father  Bill Ayer  Bill Ayer  Bill Ayer  Yeah  Something like that  And he was like I said  Just dressed like  A regular guy  Sort of guy  Helping out  And that's how we met  Stalker Patty by the way 
[03:42:30]  Yeah  During the hunger thon  She was manning the phones  And she brought like  Brownies in for us  One day or something  Because she was a fan  And the rest of the history  And perhaps  We shouldn't have just  Assumed he was a regular guy  And asked him  Hey  You wanna see something  Well  And we were  Hugely popular  So we were  We were bringing in  The most money  At NAW  For the hunger thon  By far  Oh yeah  Cause we had more people  Listening  And we have a very  Interactive audience  As you guys know 
[03:43:00]  So they were bidding  Like crazy on these items  And during the hunger thon  We had these two girls  Come in  These two black girls  And they were doing  A double dong  Dildo show  Double dong  Dildo show  For what reason  I have no idea  Maybe because it was  A Tuesday  Yeah  There didn't have to be  A reason  I don't know  If there was a reason  That day  And it was so amazing  When something like that  Is going down  You wanna turn it on  To other people  Right  It's beautiful  You wanna share it  You wanna share it  With everyone around you  So the door opens up  And I see Bill  And I go  Hey Bill 
[03:43:30]  Come in here  Check this out  Check this out  He comes walking in  Completely horrified  There are two black chicks  Ass to ass  With so much lube  And they're so juiced up  With this giant  Double dong dildo  Buried to the hilt  In both of them  They're just banging  Ass cheeks  Screaming  And that's when we  Invited the priest  To come in  And the priest  Walks in  And looks  And just shook his head  And walked out  And that I believe 
[03:44:00]  Was the last we ever  Saw of him  Or spoke to him  Or spoke to him  Our GM at the time  Came running in  In a panic  And informed us  That he was indeed  A priest  We had no idea  We didn't know  We were like  How the hell  Are we gonna  How are we supposed  To know  Who cares  The fucking  Priest  Well let me tell you  He did  Good for you guys  It would have been  Easier for him  To see a young girl  With her head  Spinning around  Spitting green shit  In his face  Than seeing those  Two black chicks 
[03:44:30]  With a double dong dildo  And the next year  Came along  And we were  Even more popular  The ratings went  Through the roof  We could have  Raised a ton of money  For the homeless  In New York  And he opted out  He said no  And they actually  Had to go to WINS  They had to go  To another radio station  The old news station  Even though they  Did it at NEW  For years  Before we came along  Unbelievable  Well  Alright back to Tara  Tara explains  How bad  Her surgery went  How bad was Tara  And what was it  Was it a breast surgery  It was a breast surgery 
[03:45:00]  And on my stomach  I had like  Bumps  So I tried  To like  I got like  Lipo detailing  Uh huh  And  What does  Lipo detailing mean  It's like  When you're  So much fat  But like  There's like  A little fat  And you kind of  Want to make  A six pack  So they can  Actually  Set the fat  In sections  To make a six pack  Like make it really smooth  So that's what I heard  So that's what I heard  I was like  Oh why not  Let's do it  Perfect  Well absolutely  The total opposite  Came out  I wound up  Having like  The bumpiest  Rollercoaster  Like you know  Looks like I had  Golf balls  All night  Really  Yeah  So I mean  It was pretty  Terrible 
[03:45:30]  In both situations  And then what about  The breast  What went wrong  With the breast  The breast  The way he went  On like  The inside of it  You know like  The nipple part  He  He  This  Did a completely  Horrific job  I mean it was  Really scarred  Terribly  Why is she on TV  Oh my god  Why  Why is she in  Entertainment  I was in the  American Pie movie  And I was in  The Josie and the  Pussycats  Look the bottom line  Is  Keep fucking with your  Body  That's where you get 
[03:46:00]  Stupid  You shallow bitch  Yeah  How about fucking  Just losing the weight  The way the rest of us  Have to  Would you know  Just do a few  Crunches  Or if you  If you do have  The money to do it  Or want to do it  Do your research  That's fine  But yeah  Don't just go to  Some butcher  Jesus Christ  Where did she go  That her belly  Ended up looking like  A mountain range  Golf balls popping out  Golf balls popping out  And then she was  You know  She was getting  In that bikini  And pictures were taken  Yeah  And put on websites 
[03:46:30]  So now what does she do  Did she have  She found another doctor  And I guess she got  Most of it fixed  I don't think you could  Get that belly shit fixed  Who knows  That's probably big like  Scarring and stuff  And maybe it's an implant now  Yeah  A plate is in there  A plate  I've never heard of  The belly plate  Well Tara says  She's really misunderstood  This is the last clip  Tyra believes in her  Of course she does  Tyra's very inspirational  I noticed  What's the most  Does it hurt  When I talk about  Something physical  Or behavior 
[03:47:00]  No I think I'm just  So misunderstood  I think  Just as a person  You know  Yeah my behavior  I mean  It's like every time  You see me out  They'll only show  A picture of me  Like with a cup  In my hand  Like they won't  Share all the benefits  I'm involved in  With children  Or this or that  They never show  Anything positive  Like everything  You know  Has just been really  Negative they've shown  And that's not  That's not really the truth  And I feel like  I've been in a really  Last couple years  Have been really rough  For me  And I'm  You know  Kind of like  Being in a storm  Or being in a hurricane  And I feel like  Now in my life  I'm coming clean  And getting myself fixed  I feel like  It's like the end  Of this storm
