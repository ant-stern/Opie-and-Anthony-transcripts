<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic critique of New York City radio stations' predictable Labor Day weekend programming, mocking their reliance on tired countdowns, themed music selections (like Beatles double plays and all-food shows), and bar broadcasts.  Specific stations mentioned included WCBS-FM, WRXP, WBAI, and Q104 (with Jerry Martir).  The hosts then shifted to a discussion of their upcoming five-hour special, sponsored by WWE Classics On Demand, featuring wrestling interviews with Mick Foley, Triple H, JBL, MVP, Taz, and Al Snow.  They expressed significant displeasure with the choice of Matt Striker as guest host, engaging in crude and humorous banter about the sponsorship and wrestlers' deaths.

The conversation then turned to Sam Roberts's impending attendance at Furry Fright 09, a furry convention.  The hosts relentlessly ribbed Sam, making frequent and explicit sexually suggestive jokes about his planned costume.  A listener called in suggesting a "Best of Bobo" weekend instead.  Further discussion of Furry Fright 09, including its ticket prices and sponsorship levels with suggestive names, and the potential for awkward situations, dominated the conversation.  The planned "Worst of O&A, Best of WWE Superstars" broadcast was also discussed,  along with the selection of Matt Striker, and a comparison of modern WWE to the ECW era.  Other topics briefly touched upon included the Michael Jackson funeral; the Diane Sawyer/Charlie Gibson ABC World News switch;  3D TVs; John Sterling's Yankees home run calls; Curt Schilling's potential Senate run; and Mayor Bloomberg's gun control measures. GWAR was mentioned as a potential guest.

The show continued with the hosts suggesting that their guest, E-Rock, should be squirted with a "jizz" shooting device. A caller discussed a proposed law regarding firearms and intoxication, sparking a debate on gun owner rights. The hosts then discussed Tiger Woods' loss at the PGA Championship and the overuse of "shorty" in hip-hop.  A significant portion was dedicated to mocking audio clips from a Boston mayoral debate featuring Mayor Menino, focusing on his rambling speech and alleged corruption.  They also reviewed calls from a Pittsburgh Penguins hockey game announcer and discussed a news story about a man slapping a crying child in Walmart.  The segment concluded by previewing the upcoming appearance of Odorous Urungus (GWAR) on Anthony's show, "Red Eye," discussing Oderus's bizarre biography and his planned appearance without his costume.

The subsequent segment featured an interview with Oderus Urungus of GWAR.  The conversation was highly sexually explicit and vulgar, focusing on Oderus's costume (particularly his large prosthetic penis, repeatedly referred to as a "schween"), his experiences with the band, and his encounters with various celebrities (Bill O'Reilly, O.J. Simpson, and the Pope).  Oderus shared anecdotes about GWAR's history, including time in Antarctica, their experiences with the music industry, and legal issues stemming from their performances.  The hosts and Oderus attempted (unsuccessfully) to have an intern stimulate the prosthetic penis. The interview included promotion of GWAR's new album, *Lust in Space*, and further vulgar jokes. After Oderus left, Dave Brockie (Oderus's real-life persona) briefly joined the show to discuss his 25 years with GWAR.  The segment ended with a GWAR song, "Let Us Slay."

The final segment included an interview with Dave Brockie.  This conversation focused on his experiences in the music industry, particularly the absurdities of managing a band like GWAR. He shared stories about record labels, their unique branding approach, and the challenges of international touring, especially transporting their elaborate costumes to Japan.  He discussed GWAR's early success, including their appearance on *Beavis and Butthead*, and concluded with a Guinness beer commercial.  The interview maintained a humorous and irreverent tone, focusing on the bizarre aspects of maintaining the GWAR persona and dealing with fans.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history, Satellite Radio.  What an Opie's palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's not forget that Jay Leno's starting his brand new TV show, what?  Next week already.  Is it next week?  Is it?  That's why James Norton has been absent.  James Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  I think he comes back for like two days next week.  He's going to give us two days next week.  That's it, he's going to throw us a bone.  Give us a couple of days.  I think he's busy with a big network TV show. 
[00:00:30]  I know.  I think this Jay Leno show is going to kick ass.  You think?  I think it's going to start a new trend.  I think it's going to make everybody else move their late night shows down an hour.  You think so?  Hour and a half, absolutely.  They're going to move into a, you know something?  If one thing does succeed like that, you do notice they all pile on.  Yeah.  So I think you're onto something there.  I'm hearing that he's going to do kind of, not an all out variety show.  Yeah.  But there's going to be more of a variety show feel to it, which makes sense with what 
[00:01:00]  TV's doing.  And he could kind of pull that off, Leno, because like his show, he, I think he was very good  at mixing that in with a talk show.  What about the other late night talk shows?  How are they doing?  Because I used to, every so often I would be like, ah, Conan's on.  Let me check it out.  Like when he was on late night.  And I have not seen Conan at all since he's been on the earlier shift.  I take a peek at Jimmy Fallon. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  But that's on the old DVR.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's a very good question.  Because I noticed I just have not, since he started, watched the first show, just kind  of see it.  Right.  And have not watched anything since then.  And I, like I've said, I used to, you know, I used to like Conan.  I'd tune in when he was on late night.  Mm-hmm.  Watch that now.  I really don't know.  I don't know how he's doing.  I know this much.  If you watch TV, they are promoting the hell out of Jay Leno. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Jay Leno's getting more exposure now than he ever did.  Really?  Oh, my God.  They're running promos.  And no matter what show you got on, on NBC, they have a little, like, that graphic.  You know, Jay Leno starts.  Hate the graphic.  September, whatever.  Hate the graphic when I'm watching the show.  Yeah.  It's getting out of control.  Some of the ones on some of the channels.  You know, if I have to see that fucking Benjamin Bratt come walking out of the side of my screen  for that, what looks like an awful show.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  What is it called?  The Cleaner.  The Cleaner.  The Closer.  The Cleaner.  The Cleaner.  No, the Cleaner.  The Duster, I think.  Where it's like, oh, look, he's trying to get another guy off drugs or booze.  Yay.  That looks like a horrible show.  And I'll be watching the show.  And he comes walking onto my show.  And he's covering up something that's very important.  Yes.  Hate that.  On the show that you are watching.  There he is.  The Cleaner.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  How is it?  Yeah.  How these shows just continue?  Does anyone watch that?  Do you get scared sometimes when these people walk out from the side of your TV? 
[00:03:00]  Right.  What are you doing?  Get out of here.  All right.  Labor Day countdown in the works.  Oh, well, Labor Day weekend coming up.  Isn't it late this year or something?  Hell yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Very smart.  Just trying to add another week onto summer.  But the problem is, like, nature already knows.  In this area of the country.  I know.  It's already, like, fall.  It's a little chilly in the morning.  And then in the daytime, the sun comes out.  But not really beating down on you as hard.  No.  No. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, we had a wash of a summer.  Worst summer in recent memory.  It poured until August.  Right.  That's pretty much what happened.  And then we got, like, a heat wave.  And then everyone freaked out.  It was like, stop freaking out about the heat wave.  We could take advantage of this and enjoy this for a few more days.  Have some fun, you bastards.  But the Labor Day countdown is in the works.  And I don't know if they do this in your city.  But here in New York.  Oh, well.  David Hinckley.  Thank God we got someone like David Hinckley.  Yes.  He writes for radio for the Daily News here in New York City. 
[00:04:00]  Fantastic.  And he gives you the rundown of what all the radio stations are doing for Labor Day weekend.  Well, it is.  It's 2009.  Is it?  Yeah, it's 2009.  I would assume they've finally figured out something new.  Right.  And exciting.  Right.  Especially with all of the options people have on this day and age to radio itself, to broadcast radio.  There's satellite radio. 
[00:04:30]  There's your iPhones, your iPods, different MP3 players.  There's so many options.  Well, he lists all the options.  So how do they spice it up for the future?  We're in 2009.  Well, what David Hinckley does, you know, you just rip out this from the paper and you can put it in your back pocket.  Yeah.  And then you know where to go all weekend long.  Oh, that's handy.  For your listening pleasure.  How handy.  Labor Day countdowns in the works.  At least four radio stations will be serving up countdowns over the Labor Day weekend, including two that may sound a little different from what we have heard in the past. 
[00:05:00]  Are you kidding?  There's going to be four radio stations doing countdowns.  Amazing.  WCBS FM.  CBS.  What do they do?  Like oldies?  Yeah, yeah.  But I think they're now playing songs in the 90s.  Yeah, which are considered oldies.  CBS FM.  Hence, there could be shake-ups near the top of the top 500. 
[00:05:30]  Say it isn't so.  Are you kidding me?  Boy, they are trying to get people to tune in with the same old fucking dreck.  Hence, there could be shake-ups near the top of the top 500 countdown.  Same old dreck.  All that means is they're going to, like, not have Stairway to Heaven as number one.  Stairway to Heaven will be number two this year, and we'll get fooled again by The Who will be number one.  What a shake-up.  That will be a hell of a shake-up.  Wow.  I don't know if we'll be able to survive that.  Imagine that.  Some radio station, I swear to God, we're in the business. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Obviously.  Broadcasting from New York.  I don't know what WRXP is.  Do you know what WRXP is?  For real?  Well, Travis is nodding, yes.  Yeah, it's the rock station.  I know Matt Pinfield does the morning show.  Are you kidding me?  No, wait.  So it's the only rock station in New York anymore.  Uh-huh.  Oh, wait.  They were kind of interested in us when we got the boot. 
[00:06:30]  Oops.  Apparently, that's also where Nick Carter works now.  Oh.  Oh, good old Nick.  All right.  So the only rock station in New York, I should know that, but you know what?  I mean, let's pet the dog today.  Sirius XM has plenty of fine rock stations.  I don't need to find a commercial rock station at this point in my life.  For music, anyway.  No.  Is new in the survey game, Anthony.  And program director Leslie Fram says the top 1,019 songs of all time will be markedly different from most rock station countdowns of the past. 
[00:07:00]  Hold on.  The top what?  1,019, because they have to use their own frequency.  Do you think people are sitting there going, that is not the 856th best song?  I would have put that at like 830.  You know, I had to like, I actually had to help like, you know, put these lists together. 
[00:07:30]  I know what you really do.  Do you just throw darts at a wall full of music?  You program the radio station with your regular rock songs.  Like you normally would.  But you pick out some of the really good ones that you would normally just play and then put them at the top of the list.  And then the rest of the music is just the same old shit.  It's just what the station plays.  Because like you said, no one is sitting there going, wait a minute.  This shouldn't be 856th.  This should be more 472th.  Dude, that one.  And you know they get the calls. 
[00:08:00]  Like, dude, that's way up.  This should be top 10.  And you put it like 590.  You know what?  I guarantee most of the people that listen to WRXP, and if they listen over the weekend, they won't even know they're listening to some dumb countdown.  No.  Labor Day countdown.  I won't even know.  Yeah.  Did that used to be the jazz station, CD 101.9?  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Now I get it.  Yeah.  Well, CD 101 was in town forever.  I never knew it was changed.  No.  So the program director promising that it's going to be a little shakedown going on with their countdown. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  Listen up then.  And then she continues.  That's right.  Stairway to Heaven may not be number one.  I was just joking about that a mere two minutes ago, and now it's being referenced.  They put it in the article.  All right.  Here's the fucking playlist.  What?  Don't Come Around Here No More.  Tom Petty.  Right.  Cashmere, Led Zeppelin.  Come As You Are.  Nirvana.  No Sunlight.  Death Cab for Cutie.  That's a good band, actually. 
[00:09:00]  Surrender.  Cheap Trick.  Only Happen When It Rains.  Of course, Garbage.  One Thing Leads to Another.  The Fix.  Zombie.  You know what?  You know, some dumb program director, whatever her name is?  Yeah.  She probably makes easily six figures to put that list together.  Yeah.  A kid could put a better list together on his iPod.  Yeah.  I should say iPhone, really.  They do on a daily basis.  Yeah.  The average kid could put together a much better list of songs. 
[00:09:30]  Well, Anthony, we continue.  The Labor Day countdowns in the works.  Thank you, David Hinckley.  I'm going to put this in my back pocket.  Yeah.  So I can scan the dial all weekend long.  Take the one out from your pocket from last year, and we'll compare it.  That's probably the exact same thing.  Goddamn thing.  Also, don't miss, David Hinckley says, WBAI 99.5 FM.  Alone These Days.  It says Alone These Days.  We'll do.  What is Alone These?  What is he?  Also, not to miss WBAI. 
[00:10:00]  Alone These Days.  Does that make sense?  No.  Okay.  We'll do wall-to-wall coverage of the Caribbean Parade on Eastern Parkway Monday.  All right.  That sounds exciting to listen to.  So you get to hear, like, a live parade on WBAI.  You hear a lot of steel drums, I bet.  Honestly, that's a little different, at least.  What?  Q104.  Happy Hour Kickoff tomorrow at 4 with Jerry Martir.  Wow.  He's still doing that.  Yes.  Holy shit. 
[00:10:30]  God bless Jer, man.  Let me tell you.  He's still doing that fucking Jerry's gin joint kind of a thing he did back in, like,  the 80s.  Well, he's a huge fan of ours, so I really don't feel like trashing the guy.  I love Jerry Martir.  Don't get me wrong.  But I feel sorry for him, and if he wants me to take him out with my car, I will certainly  do that for you, Jerry.  If you see him walk across the street, just give me a wink next time you see me, and I  know, all right, you want me to end your miserable life of radio. 
[00:11:00]  Poor Jerry.  But here's the difference.  He used to do Jerry's gin joint.  Jerry's gin joint.  For some old-timers, you know, that are from the Long Island area, where he would do a broadcast  from the studio, but he made it sound like he was live.  It was brilliant, especially for the time.  He'd have sound effects and everything.  It sounded like he was broadcasting from a place that you wanted to be at.  Right.  It just sounded cool.  Well, I worked at BAB at the time, and the phones would ring off the hook because everyone 
[00:11:30]  was trying to find this place.  They're like, where is he?  Where Jerry was broadcasting from.  That's how good he was.  Jerry's gin joint.  And you'd hear, like, beers popping.  Well, this is how stupid radio is.  That was a brilliant show that Jerry put together himself.  Yep.  And he was always trying to make it better with, like, he would have, like, fake contests that  were going on.  Yeah.  And you would walk in the studio, and you would at least think the studio was rocking,  and there's Jerry just sitting behind a microphone.  With a bunch of cards with his sound effects.  Right. 
[00:12:00]  But there'd be pool balls.  Like, you'd hear people, like, breaking a rack of pool balls and shit.  So I was new to the business, so I thought at least the studio had a lot of this stuff.  Right.  I knew that he was using sound effects, but I really thought that he was doing what other  people.  Yeah.  He would be talking to imaginary people, give me a beer and all that.  Anyway, this is how stupid radio is.  So Jerry did that show for many, many years.  Now he just goes to freaking bars.  A real bar. 
[00:12:30]  A real bar.  It's not the same thing.  No.  He can't use his imagination as well if he's in a studio with a bunch of sound effects.  After that, Q104 will continue this Labor Day weekend with double plays.  Ready for this, Anthony?  Double plays.  Double plays.  Of Beatles all weekend.  Wow.  So you're getting, like, two Beatles songs.  They want to just play one Beatles song.  Well, they don't want to call it Twofers.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that's Two for Tuesday.  So they're calling it double play.  It's a double play.  Yeah, they're giving you two songs by the Beatles all weekend long. 
[00:13:00]  Wow.  And then Sunday night at 9, Jonathan Clark interviews Joe Perry and John Fulgert.  No way.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well.  Did that need to be in a radio article?  Yes, apparently.  We did the BAI, right?  Pre-Caribbean parade coverage.  All right.  But then they're going to be doing something called Telling It Like It Is with Jacqueline  Mestre.  That sounds angry.  That sounds angry, I bet.  I bet the way she's telling it like it is is nothing like I want it. 
[00:13:30]  No, I don't think she's going to be friendly to Whitey.  No.  Tell it like it is.  BAI.  They were pretty, what was the station that was just unbelievable when we were growing  up?  Jesus Christ.  It was all black.  Oh, oh, L-I-B.  L-I-B.  Liberation.  It was W-L-I-B.  Oh, man.  It was, oh, they were angry.  Hell yeah, they were.  I nearly, I used to listen to that all the time when I was working for a living, like 
[00:14:00]  up on rooftops.  I almost like punted my radio off the roof so many times just because this would be, this  guy would just annoy the piss out of me.  Right.  Gary Bird.  It's M-O-T-E-P Gary Bird talking about how melanin in the system is better for the brain.  So the more melanin you have, the more developed your brain becomes.  And I'm sitting there going, shut the fuck up.  Just racial epithets flying out of my mouth. 
[00:14:30]  Mm-hmm.  M-O-T-E-P Gary Bird will have a special guest on why white people suck.  Yeah.  Really?  If you like this radio shit, you should try to find some of those old tapes.  Oh, those old clips are great.  They're pretty amazing.  I have some right here.  I could pull them in the back.  Do you?  Yeah.  Get us one.  Get a real angry one.  Get a really good one.  Moving on in.  Labor Day countdowns in the works for all the radio stations here in New York. 
[00:15:00]  WBZO.  Ready for this?  I don't even know what WBZO is.  It's the Bozo.  The Bozo?  I have no idea.  Oh, okay.  I would call it the Bozo.  I bet you they don't even do that.  No.  I would listen to a station just called the Bozo.  Hey, it's the Bozo.  Why not?  Listener voted top 103 party songs.  Listener voted.  Yeah.  Now, Opie, you've been in the biz for quite some time.  How does listener voted stuff work in the radio station, behind the scenes? 
[00:15:30]  I don't know, because we've never paid attention to the listeners.  Never really gave me shit.  No, you make believe you care about them, you make believe when they call in for their  requests, when they email their top party songs.  Yeah.  You don't even check your email.  Isn't it pretty much...  Because you know what?  The program director knows better.  Yeah.  Isn't it pretty much the PD will put together the list?  Yes.  And then if someone requests a song on that list...  So happened to.  ...you'll then play it...  Yes.  ...and then play their request that's been taped.  Yes.  Yes.  So it sounds like listener voted. 
[00:16:00]  Yes.  Hey, you know, Jenny voted for this one.  Yeah.  And then they'll play her asking for it.  Well, I've said many, many times.  I mean, I did a lot of rock radio before getting into this talk business.  And people...  I never understood the person that couldn't figure out the whole request thing.  Yeah.  I would sit there and do, you know, music shows, and I would get a minimum, a minimum of 100  calls an hour.  Yeah.  You could only play maybe 12 songs an hour. 
[00:16:30]  It's all in the numbers.  Figure it out.  Right.  Just figure it out.  Do the math.  No one's playing your request.  No.  In a blue moon, maybe.  But like Anne said, if a song just happened to be coming up and you called for it, oh,  yeah, yeah, sure.  Tom in Central Islip, here's your Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Wasn't the last hour of your show the all request and dedication hour?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And were they requests?  No.  No.  No.  Half the names I used back then were my cousins, my friends, just so they could hear their names 
[00:17:00]  on the radio.  I would use nicknames that only, like, old, you know, college buddies.  Yeah.  You know.  No.  That's the all request and dedication hour.  I would always use the names of my friends and family.  That's great.  It's all bullshit.  CBS FM, we did that.  Okay.  WFDU.  The Fudge?  Check this out, Anne.  What?  The Fudge Dugu?  Labor Day weekend. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  WFDU.  Yeah.  Rich Sabello plays an all food show.  That isn't really in there, is it?  Yes.  Is that really in the newspaper?  Yes.  Rich Sabello, this Labor Day weekend, is going to play an all food show.  How do you do that on the air?  I don't know what that means.  What is an all food show, by the way?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just don't know.  I mean, the call letter is WFDU.  Is it, do they talk about food to begin with? 
[00:18:00]  I have no idea.  No, it's Fairleigh Dickinson University.  Oh.  Oh.  Excuse me.  Why is she dressed like a fairy princess this morning?  Uh, yeah, your, um.  VX.  Your ex is doing traffic on Channel 11.  In a prom dress.  Yeah, she looks like, yeah, she was at some kind of ball last night.  I don't know.  It was, well, interesting.  It just doesn't look right.  WFUV, Anthony.  Yes.  Labor Day song features on the mile. 
[00:18:30]  The mile Falti?  Wow, man.  What does that mean?  I have no idea.  Is that the name of the person that does the show?  Maybe.  Or is it the name of the show?  What does that mean?  Mile F-A-I-L-T-E.  What does that mean?  Falti.  Falti.  You threw me.  All right.  They're doing mixed bag.  Sunday breakfast. 
[00:19:00]  Woody's children.  Sunday opinions.  And American roots.  Or routes.  Like roads.  Uh-oh.  They're just going to talk about roads.  Yeah, not roots, as in roots.  WHUD.  Top 300 most played songs.  That's what they're doing.  Why would you play the most played songs?  Aren't they?  Doesn't that mean they're played out?  Of course.  So why play all of them together?  WKTU, party songs, tomorrow at 1 p.m. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  WQHT, Hot 97, party mixes all weekend.  Party mix.  WWFS, flashback weekends, 80s and 90s.  Oh, I'm there.  And our old station, I guess it's now a pop station.  What?  92.3.  Oh, yeah.  K-Rock.  It'll always be K-Rock.  Yeah.  Labor Day Live.  Ready for this?  They're doing nine-minute, 23-second mini-mixes all weekend. 
[00:20:00]  9.23.  Mini-mixes.  First of all.  What's a mini-mix?  A mini-mix.  What's a mini-mix?  First of all, enough with having to do something with the frequency.  No one cares about the frequency.  You don't have to match your frequency number with what you're doing.  Mini-mixes.  Danny, do you know what a mini-mix is?  I'm assuming it's like a regular-sized mix, but not as large. 
[00:20:30]  Ah.  Is it?  But see, if I read this, I'd go, wow, they're playing even more fucking commercials.  Yeah.  They already play too many fucking commercials.  Now they're only playing nine minutes and 23 seconds of music.  And then you hear commercial.  Right.  That's what it sounds like to me.  Yeah, but I think what it is is they're just going to, like, do a, I don't know.  Maybe it's a nine-minute, 23-second commercial break.  Like, instead of playing Lady Gaga's, like, just the regular version of Poker Face or one  of those fucking songs she does.  An extended mix?  That's what I'm thinking.  Oh, fuck.  That would get tedious. 
[00:21:00]  After a while, right?  Who?  So there you go.  Uh, wait.  This guy knows what mall, mail, what?  Hold on.  Tim in Cleveland.  Tim, what do you got?  Hey, um, yeah.  Mail and Faulte.  Uh, you can, you'll see it in a lot of Irish bars.  It's usually, like, on a little plaque.  It stands for, uh, a million thank yous.  It's Irish.  Ah.  So they're doing, so they're doing that Saturday from eight to nine.  I still don't know what that means.  What, are they going to play a couple Irish songs? 
[00:21:30]  Um, maybe it just means a million thank yous in there.  They got a big Irish audience.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, thank you for, uh, at least, at least we know what that means now.  Trying to clear it up.  Yeah, exactly.  Thanks.  That's the name of the show, actually.  Oh, really?  It's another, it's Fordham University's radio station.  Oh, God.  He's putting college radio stuff in there.  Great.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning.  Hey, check out this wackiness.  Um, W-O-G-L in Philly is, uh, playing their entire playlist, but instead of doing it from 
[00:22:00]  A to Z, they're doing a Z to A weekend.  Oh, wow.  That's insane.  Are you kidding me?  So they're just using last year's list and just flipping it.  Yeah.  What do we do?  Uh, just take last year's list and, uh, flip it over.  All right.  Let me, uh, go to Draws in Jersey.  Draws.  Hey, good evening.  Hey, Draws.  Evening.  Uh, I was listening to Classic Rewind yesterday.  And this weekend, they're doing the STD weekend. 
[00:22:30]  Singles, triples, and doubles.  STD, also sexually transmitted disease.  That's funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's about it.  Punch out.  Singles, triples, and doubles.  Yeah.  That's, uh, take the baseball angle.  You play two, one, two, or three songs by an artist, I guess.  Yeah.  Ah, that's great.  Let's go to Mike in Hudson Valley.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Mike.  Yeah, what's going on?  WPDH broadcasts at the Kipsies. 
[00:23:00]  101.5.  Yeah.  This is their fourth year in a row now.  They're doing the top 1,015.  But started this Wednesday, and this is what their pitch line is.  Wait by your grill on Monday afternoon around 5 o'clock.  We'll have the final top five songs.  The same thing every four years.  Jesus Christ.  No one, no one, and I mean no one cares about that shit.  I'm going to be waiting for it.  I got to stand by and wait for the top five songs.  1,000. 
[00:23:30]  1,000.  I'm embarrassed by this business.  I really am.  Yeah, it's.  I'm embarrassed by this business.  There's zilch creativity left.  No.  In radio.  There's nothing left.  Thank you, sir.  The same shit they've been feeding people.  Uh, for what?  For fucking decades.  Forever.  So there you go.  David Henkely's radio column.  Talking about what all the radio stations are doing this Labor Day weekend.  Well, I can't wait. 
[00:24:00]  There's not one that stands out.  With something like, now that's cool.  That's different.  Yep.  That's unique.  Or we're doing a wrestling interview countdown.  Are we really?  Yeah, it's the best wrestling interviews of all time.  On this channel?  Yeah.  Well, that you guys have done.  Oh, man.  We got to start paying attention again.  Are you kidding?  How did that get past us?  Uh, WWE what time?  Oh, that's why.  Oh, okay.  So it's like an infomercial.  Great.  We're now doing infomercials. 
[00:24:30]  Remember when radio stations.  Wait, that's a bunch of, that sounds horrible.  I love the WWE.  Yeah.  We promote, promote, promote.  We've, we've sold a lot of tickets over the years for those guys.  What is this?  It's the best wrestling, WWE interviews that you guys have done in your entire career.  So like, hey, here's fucking, you know.  Do you remember that time when you guys had, uh, the game in?  Right, right. 
[00:25:00]  Sandy spanked that chick.  Yeah.  Sam, what's going on?  And JB.  First of all, it's not a countdown.  What is it?  Oh, it's not.  It's just a show.  There's no countdown element.  It's, it's all our wrestling interviews?  And before we get crazy, it's brought to you by WWE Classics On Demand.  Yeah, good for them.  I'm happy for them.  Uh-huh.  And who's hosting this?  There's three hosts.  Three hosts.  All right.  Let me guess.  All right.  You.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Obviously E-Rock.  E-Rock. 
[00:25:30]  Who's the third though?  Uh, hmm.  Do I know the third?  Oh, you know him.  It's not Danny.  And it's not Travis.  It's a celebrity host.  Wow.  Who's the celebrity?  Like, Mankind?  No.  Oh, see, that would have been good.  He's not in WWE anymore.  Taz is good.  Taz is real good on the radio.  He's not in WWE anymore.  Oh, oh, oh.  But Taz and McFarland.  Brutus the Barber Beefcake?  He's not in WWE anymore.  No?  British Bulldog. 
[00:26:00]  Is dead.  Oh, he's dead.  And here's this bit again.  All right, ladies and gentlemen.  Strapping for this bit again.  Is it Special Delivery Jones?  Yeah.  No, it's not Special Delivery Jones.  Is it the Fabulous Moolah?  Look, okay.  These are all dead wrestlers.  What?  When did she die?  We know it's not them.  Is it Bryan Adams?  No, he's dead.  That was Crush.  Uh, Chris Benoit.  All right.  Well, that was a huge news story.  Oh, it's Bam Bam Bam.  Ben Lo.  Dead.  Oh.  Earthquake?  Dead. 
[00:26:30]  Dead.  Earthquake?  He died of cancer.  Eddie Guerrero.  No, he's dead.  Oh, damn it.  I'm sure you knew that.  When did that happen?  Yeah.  Years ago?  It's so weird, because these guys look very healthy in their pictures.  Yeah.  Why are they all dead?  Well, Earthquake died of cancer.  Crash, Holly?  Crash?  Crash died of alcohol poisoning.  What?  When the hell did this happen?  Why wasn't I told?  Well, we know it's Classy Freddy Blasty.  No, it's not.  He died of old age.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, he's one of the lucky ones.  He gets to die of old age. 
[00:27:00]  I know what would make a perfect broadcast.  Mr. Perfect.  No, he's not.  Why?  Because he had a heart attack.  No way!  So he didn't get to die of old age?  Wow.  How many wrestlers get to die of old age?  How many are lucky enough to do that?  Classy Freddy Blasty.  Yeah.  Gorilla Monsoon.  Two.  And Killer Kowalski.  All right.  We got three that got to go to the end of their lives.  Is Stu Hart still alive?  No. 
[00:27:30]  Stu Hart died of old age.  Could you do me a favor and get a picture with Big Dick Dudley?  No.  How could I when he's not around anymore?  I thought he was going to be hosting.  First of all, he was never in WWE.  And second of all, he's dead.  Why do these guys die in their 30s?  Because they're not muscular.  They look like they're in very good shape.  I wonder why.  I'm very confused by this.  They're very, very over muscular.  Right.  They wank out a lot.  Yeah.  It's all working out.  So who's the third host for the big wrestling interview special we're doing? 
[00:28:00]  It's going to be a good show.  First of all, we have a lot of good memories with wrestlers.  We've done crazy things with them in the past.  I guess we just figured we had too many people listening to this channel and we wanted to  It's going to increase listenership because it's the Opie and Anthony spin on these wrestlers.  It's not just talking about wrestling.  Yeah.  We figured we'd, what, weed out a bunch of our listeners?  No.  Is that what we're doing?  We'll educate our listeners to what a great product WWE Classics On Demand is.  Yeah.  By featuring some of the best wrestlers that we've had on the show. 
[00:28:30]  Who are they going to hear from?  On the show?  Yeah, the listeners.  Who are they going to hear from?  Well, we'll be playing.  We have Mick Foley, Triple H, JBL, MVP.  Who else is on there?  Taz and Al Snow from a long time ago.  Why won't Owen Hart be here?  No.  My health doesn't allow him.  Oh, sorry, Owen.  Because how many hours of time did the WWE buy?  It's a five-hour show. 
[00:29:00]  Well, it's taking the place of the worst of the week.  Countdown.  Oh, that's smart.  It's a five-hour show that we're here throughout the weekend.  Now, you guys are going to be sitting here for five hours?  Yeah.  Just listening to everything and talking to each other?  Yeah.  Wow.  But you still don't know who the third host is.  You know what?  I don't even need to know.  Why?  Because I'm not going to be listening.  Why not?  It's going to be a good show.  And most of these people aren't going to be listening.  Yes, they are.  Why would they?  Why would they?  They are. 
[00:29:30]  Just stop it.  Really?  Come on.  No.  And what's going to be great is, because our listener base is so large, WWE Classics On  Demand will see an immediate, you know, bounce up in subscribers.  You know how many new subscribers they're going to get?  Because they are sponsoring the worst of Opie and Anthony presents the best of the  WWE superstars.  That's amazing.  Plus, those banners with Opie and Anthony and the virus will be on WWE.com and stuff. 
[00:30:00]  Cross promotion.  Okay, let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Iron Sheik pissing himself.  Is that going to be part of it?  Iron Sheik will be part of it.  That's got to be the number one.  So now they don't even need to listen.  Well, it's not a countdown.  Now you don't need to listen because we already know the number one.  It's not.  There is no number one.  It's Monday weekend.  It's got to be a countdown.  It's the law.  It's not a countdown.  Like, you guys aren't going to be teasing what the number one interview of all time is.  Well, there will be teasing involved, but not in a countdown style because we don't  want to confuse people into thinking it's the worst of the week countdown. 
[00:30:30]  Coming up is the number one interview.  We're not going to say number one because it's not a countdown.  Is our channel now just bartering?  Anyone can just buy time on this channel?  We're like Nickelodeon late at night where it's just ads for fucking Bosley.  We have sponsors from major corporations and giant global companies that want to work  with the Opie and Anthony show, right?  Yeah, good for them.  You sure do put a positive spin on everything, don't you? 
[00:31:00]  Well, I mean, WWE is giving us money.  Dude, you're the only one excited about this.  Let's be honest.  No, it's going to be a good show.  So what you're saying is, in essence, we have whored out our channel.  Not whored out.  For money.  Listen.  We have taken our channel as if it was our vagina.  No.  Or our bunghole.  Our coolie hole.  Coolie.  And for money, for money, we will let anyone put anything in the coolie hole. 
[00:31:30]  Radio stations stay afloat through advertisements and sponsorships.  Not satellite, my friend.  No.  Well, this channel does.  No.  This is a subscriber-based business.  Yes.  So fuck them.  But fuck them and their fuckholes.  What's happening is, we're not doing...  I concur.  We're not doing something different.  We're playing the best interviews. 
[00:32:00]  This is already stuff in the Best of Opie and Anthony catalog.  So it's...  This is good stuff.  This is all stuff that you...  Oh, come on.  Don't play that.  It's all stuff that you guys said...  Oh, this was good.  Oh, that went well.  Mick Foley, Triple H, MVP, JBL, John Cena.  I don't care.  I don't care.  With a special guest host in the WWE? 
[00:32:30]  Along with me and Emrah?  I don't care.  All right.  Wait, wait.  I'm now interested in the special guest host because it's from the WWE?  Yes.  It's a lesser-known guy, obviously.  He's not a lesser-known guy.  He's on TV every week.  He's probably on his way out of the WWE.  This is his last gig before he has to go back to the minors.  He's on TV every week.  He just happens to be...  Ted Sheckler?  No, it's not Ted Sheckler.  He's not an employee.  The Undertaker?  I was wrestling employee.  Huh?  Undertaker?  It's not The Undertaker. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, please.  Why not?  If the WWE cares about the O.P. and Anthony channel, they would give us nothing but the  best for this horseshit special that they bought.  It's not horseshit.  It's going to be a really good special.  Hold on.  Will there be special music being played before this man walks into the studio?  Oh, please.  Will it?  Please.  What kind of...  I'm a master!  Yeah!  Yes, man!  Come on!  Now I'm listening, Sam.  God damn.  Here's your thing.  Come on!  Yeah! 
[00:33:30]  Yeah!  Fucking ass man's going to be here Saturday.  Now we're talking.  All right.  We're all going to be listening.  He loves to kick him or something.  I love to kick him.  What does he do?  He loves to shove him.  Shove him.  And he sticks him.  Flunk him.  Flunk him.  Watch him.  I love to kick him.  Kick him.  Kick him.  That's right.  Kick him.  Ass man!  Ass man!  Yeah!  I am so in.  No, here's the problem.  What? 
[00:34:00]  Here's the problem with that whole situation.  What?  The WWE is sending over one of their superstars to host the show on Saturday.  Whereas Mr. Ass will again be wrestling in New Jersey or wherever it is in a high school.  In a high school gymnasium.  With me doing play-by-play the week after.  Are you kidding?  Oh, no.  Give me a list of the WWE superstars.  Play-by-play for Mr. Ass.  I'm going to guess who the third host is.  A list of every superstar? 
[00:34:30]  Well, if the WWE is buying five hours on this channel, they're giving us the best.  They're giving us the best guy.  Yeah, you can click on that.  You're saying it's not The Undertaker, right?  Well, it would have to be from the Raw superstars.  I mean, I would imagine.  Well, yeah.  Let me see.  Randy Orton?  What do we got?  Oh, fuck.  Do you want me to tell you which roster it's from?  Yeah.  It's not from Raw.  Oh, no.  It's not from SmackDown?  SmackDown.  No?  It's the ECW.  I mean, there's a lot of great superstars in ECW.  A lot of people don't really. 
[00:35:00]  No, people watch ECW.  It's on SyFy on Tuesdays.  Not as much as SyFy on Tuesdays.  I don't even know what channel the SyFy channel is.  It depends on your local area.  Oh, God.  I couldn't find it within five minutes if my life depended on it, Sam.  Well, I can.  And he just farted on Sam.  Sam.  He didn't fart on me.  We're not getting a Raw guy or a SmackDown guy?  We got somebody who's a Long Island native, who's a very good talker.  He'll be good on the radio.  That's a good hint. 
[00:35:30]  He talks every week.  I'm not really getting it.  I know, you know, like I said, mankind.  Who agreed to this?  We should only get the best of the best.  You should be sitting here, Sam, doing a wrestling show with, like, one of the biggies.  Well, I mean, you know, somebody to come in on a Saturday to do a five.  Who is it?  You know him.  Who is it?  Matt Stryker.  What?  Matt Stryker. 
[00:36:00]  What the fuck is Matt Stryker?  He's the play-by-play guy.  He used to be a school teacher.  Then he became a pro wrestler.  Now he does color commentary for ECW.  He's your teacher, the extreme educator, Matt Stryker.  The WWE hates us.  No, they don't hate us.  They obviously hate us.  Although they might start thinking that you hate them.  They bought five hours on this channel.  And they go, all right, we'll give you this guy.  Matt Stryker talks every week.  He's a talker. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, it's just like having Triple H or Randy Orton.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it's right up there.  Well, I mean, I think Triple H and Randy Orton couldn't free up five hours.  Yeah, why would they?  I mean, it is five hours.  Yeah, is it?  It's not like, you know, five hours on a Saturday?  Yeah.  Live?  Of course.  And then it replaced her at the weekend.  By the way, it's not live.  You guys already taped it.  Of course.  We shut up.  It's been voice tracked.  Not yet.  No. 
[00:37:00]  Not until Saturday.  Better get on it.  This room will be completely empty and the lights won't be on when this special is airing.  So you're going to sit there and tell me.  Stop making believe that it's this big live thing.  You think Matt Stryker's coming here at 11.30 this morning to tape it?  Even you get the weekend off.  Is that what's happening?  No.  What time is he getting here?  Saturday morning.  I think it starts at 9.  At 9?  No, you won't be here.  Right after the show today, Matt Stryker's coming in and taping this.  But it's going to be a good special.  Look, it'll get back to him. 
[00:37:30]  I like the guy.  But, I mean, if the WWE's, you know, taking our channel over for five hours.  Yeah.  How about you?  How about you throw a little bit more of a name on than Matt Stryker?  He's a good, people know who he is.  He's an up-and-comer for the last five years.  No, he does the color commentary for ECW.  He's a great color analyst.  All the fans, I'm reading here, all the fans of the show think it's the guy that calls up every day, Stryker.  No, it's not that guy. 
[00:38:00]  I'd rather have him.  No, to be honest with you, I'd rather have him.  I don't understand why.  He calls up with some good stuff.  I think he can handle himself.  Matt Stryker is an internationally known superstar.  Yeah.  Superstar.  Not someone who you're going to call.  Oh, he's a star.  He's a superstar.  You are a dude.  My mic's not on anymore.  Yes, exactly.  My mic.  Something may have gone wrong in the tech area.  No. 
[00:38:30]  No.  No.  No.  That wasn't really it.  Sorry.  This weekend.  And I hate to tell you, but we might have to start showing up to these meetings again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We might have to start actually listening.  I know we got away with murder for a few years, but I think we really might have to start showing  up for the Opie and Anthony meetings again.  Yeah.  It's on Saturday and Sunday.  It's not the whole Labor Day weekend.  What happens when we're not here?  What do you mean?  What happens?  A lot gets done.  Who agreed to this?  Yeah.  Who actually went?  We went to a sales meeting.  It was pitched and everything. 
[00:39:00]  It went through.  And then we chased you guys after the show.  And you guys went, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fine.  Of course.  Yeah.  It is like a rat maze in here after the show.  I mean, everything does technically get approved by you guys.  So you did approve this.  I don't see how you cannot meet with us within the boundaries of 36 floors in an elevator.  So how you can't just give us the lowdown as we hit the lobby, the meeting's over.  I think we just say yes so we can get out of here even faster. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  But you say yes.  The word yes is said.  And guess what?  So we agreed to this?  Yes.  100% you did.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Steve was complaining yesterday because he said he had to do two laps around the Sirius  XM floor to get a guest pitch in.  Well, it's my latest video on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  Opie was running away from Steve.  And what people want to know in the latest video, Ant, is what you were discussing with  Steve Blatter.  Oh, is that the big question?  Yeah, because I ran around trying to avoid the big bear attack. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And every time I turned the camera back around, Steve's fucking face was in my HD flip.  But when I came around and did a loop, they heard only a very, they heard like three seconds  of a very, very intense conversation we were having with one of the suits.  Did they?  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  Dane Cook.  Well, I don't know if the... 
[00:40:30]  Big name.  Oh, what do you think?  Steve has chased me down the hall because I'm trying to get out of the building.  Stopped foot twice.  Stopped running.  And now I'm running away from Steve.  Oh my God.  It does look like bear footage.  Yeah.  It's like you're running away from a bear.  It's all shaky.  Yeah.  Oh.  Ah, and then he's right there.  See, it's a bear attack.  Oh, if I send you Fox News clips of Odorous Yerungus, will you take a look at them?  Odorous Yerungus.  Is that the Gwar guy?  That's the Gwar guy. 
[00:41:00]  Is it Gwar or Gwar?  Gwar.  For Thursday or Friday.  So would it be...  Oh.  Seems to be shaking the camera.  Yes.  At least look at the clips.  He's been on red-eyed by night.  And he thought I was listening to him and I turned around and started running.  Now he's running.  Stop running.  And now he's got to chase me again.  The big bear.  This place is like a big maze, too.  It really is.  Sometimes you just don't know where the door is anymore.  They're a meeting room.  They are.  I'm going to send those to you.  It makes it less complicated.  Cartoon character.  Why are we having them on our show? 
[00:41:30]  Cartoon character.  He works.  Huh?  All right.  This is the part I want.  And we get a quick look event in serious discussion with Steve Blatter.  One of the suits.  Until they said something.  And then there's your fucking correction.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  So I'm going to send you this one.  Oh, wow.  And that's what everyone wants to know.  Yeah.  They were watching the video last night and going, what the fuck was Anthony discussing  at the end of the video? 
[00:42:00]  Anything you could talk about?  No, I was actually telling him who should be fired in this place to correct the huge  problems that we have.  And that's the correction right there.  Sorry, Sam.  No, it's not me.  Oh, it was absolutely Sam.  Why didn't you guys put me around the bush there?  It was Sam.  It's too much of a wrestling influence.  We're bringing money in for the show.  Somehow you were able to get by us.  No, I didn't.  You pitched a five-hour wrestling show. 
[00:42:30]  But we brought money in.  People haven't watched wrestling in a decade, Sam.  It's still the highest rated show on cable television.  Stop it.  It is.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't buy that.  People watch wrestling in the millions.  WWE is a hot commodity.  They're recession-proof.  Recession-proof.  So much so that they can afford to sponsor weekend programming for us.  Oh, really?  That's what they choose to do with their money. 
[00:43:00]  They could just keep it for themselves.  But no, they give it to us.  Thanks.  Well, that sounds exciting.  It's going to be a good show.  We've done crazy things with wrestlers.  Nielsen Television TV ratings for cable TV top 20.  I knew it was Wizards of Waverly Place.  Wizards of Waverly Place.  Followed by The Closer.  My favorite tween show, by the way.  By the way, Wizards of Waverly Place has 11 million, about 11 and a half million viewers. 
[00:43:30]  The Closer is next with seven and about a quarter million.  Oh, yeah.  The Wizards is just the best show.  Then comes WWE Entertainment with five, about six million, just shy of six million viewers.  No, they're in third place, and they have half the audience of the number five cable show.  They got six million viewers.  They're pretty much tied with Royal Pains.  And look at number six.  I don't even know what Royal Pains is. 
[00:44:00]  They got five.  They got three and six.  All right.  What's Royal Pains?  That's that show about that doctor guy that goes out to the Hamptons and treats the rich  people so they don't have to go to the hospital.  Get the fuck out of here.  Who the fuck watches that?  I watched one episode.  Was it good?  It was like, wow, this blows.  Okay.  Two in the top 10.  Yeah.  And SpongeBob has six in the top 20.  Jesus Christ.  All located under what?  WWE Entertainment.  Yeah.  Chisel in Pittsburgh.  By SpongeBob.  Chisel in Pittsburgh has a very good question. 
[00:44:30]  Chisel.  Good morning, boy.  Good morning, Chisel.  Hey, man.  I was wondering if Sam was going to be able to host a furry convention on a Saturday one  time.  What are you talking about?  I mean, the best of the furries would be great show for you guys.  The furries.  Wow.  You should do the best of the furries.  First of all, I don't know anything about it, but if they were good enough.  You go in a fur costume.  You cut out your hiney hole.  What is that near the cooley hole?  The cooley hole.  Yeah, you got to have the cooley hole. 
[00:45:00]  Interchangeable cooley hole.  And you show your cooley.  That has no value.  Your cooley belt has to be exposed.  And your general's got to be hanging out the front.  Yes.  Well, the furry convention has an offer to sponsor our program.  But I'm sure they would.  They did.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, by the way, where's the countdown?  How many days before Furry Fright 09?  People were Twittering me about it because somebody with a very large following decided 
[00:45:30]  to mention it on his Twitter yesterday.  So I was getting plenty of replies and reminders all day.  Well, Sam, people are very excited.  I guess some people are.  They're waiting for the big reveal of what you're going to be wearing to Furry Fright 09.  Sounds huge.  When are you going to announce this?  I don't have a...  I don't know.  When are you announcing what you're wearing for Furry Fright 09?  I don't have a thought about it.  But people are waiting.  People are not...  Especially on Twitter.  People are waiting for this weekend.  There's a buzz out there.  They're all waiting for the big announcement. 
[00:46:00]  I don't think that's the case.  I think people are excited.  What are you thinking?  Maybe like something in a masculine color, like a blue.  All right.  So far, you got your furry costume will be some kind of blue color.  Like a royal blue, not a sky blue.  A royal blue.  Okay.  Like maybe a blue dragon.  You might go as a blue dragon.  Wow, really?  But I don't know where...  With your cooley hole.  With your cooley hole showing.  Here's the thing.  Not only would the cooley hole be covered, there'd be a giant tail behind it.  But right under the cooley hole.  Yeah, all you have to do is lift that tail. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, you need your hole exposed cooley hole.  At least you can walk around during the cocktail hour without your cooley hole being exposed to everyone.  But when it's time for some, you know, hardcore action, all you have to do is lift up the tail.  Lift the tail.  Think how easy it'll be to go to the bathroom.  There's no sexual intercourse that's going to be associated with this.  Is that your costume?  First of all, that is your costume.  That's purple.  And it says special order.  So we can have this in the mail by tomorrow.  Oh, now the company's got money for a furry outfit.  Oh, no, that'll come from my fucking pocket. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, you're so good.  Oh, that's a good one right there.  I will buy your furry costume.  I can't believe how thoughtful you're being.  So you're thinking a blue dragon?  I'm not thinking.  I would just, if they're, yeah, well, that's inflatable.  It certainly is.  Do you have, like, a second choice just in case they're out of blue dragon costumes?  What, the furry store?  Yeah.  I don't know, like.  Will you take suggestions on your Twitter? 
[00:47:30]  Of course I'll take suggestions.  That's a child's outfit.  Not Sam on Twitter.  Yes, I will take suggestions.  You can suggest his furry costume.  I would just love it.  Why am I saying costume, man?  What's wrong with me?  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  By the way, Odorous Erungus will be here later today in full costume.  Costume.  I love how people try to spell costume on Twitter, by the way.  It's C-O-S-T-U-M-E.  No, not really.  Costume.  Costume.  That's not how they spell it.  And by the way, I went over to my parents' house, and they said that they had nothing 
[00:48:00]  to do with the way I say costume.  Costume.  Then I asked my brother to say it, and he said it just like me.  So it was their fault.  Costume.  Costume.  Because why would me and my brother both say it?  Say what?  Costume.  Like retards.  Why would you say it like retards would say it?  We don't sound like retards.  Costume.  That's the proper pronunciation.  Oh, this guy's a great way for you to kill yourself, by the way.  Oh, good.  Let's listen to this then, of course.  Dan?  Dan.  Hopefully he killed himself.  Oh, Dan.  Dan, we're going to you. 
[00:48:30]  You're not there?  Hello?  He's dead.  Hello?  Hello?  All right.  Let's say hi to Paul in Ohio.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Sam.  Why don't you just throw the ratings completely in the shitter and have like a Best of Bobo weekend  instead?  Oh.  First of all, that has been suggested.  Really?  Yes.  And more people like Bobo than hate him.  Bobo was a great appearance yesterday, I think.  Absolutely.  I got some feedback there that was very funny.  Although yesterday we put a box over his head and started throwing balls at him and were 
[00:49:00]  asked to please stop doing that.  Oh, they finally are on to you, Sam?  Yeah.  Sick fuck.  All right.  We should take a break.  So, oh, it's right here on the prep sheet.  Thank God.  43 days until Fur Fright 2009.  Oh, yeah.  No.  It's the number one thing to talk about every day on the show.  It's not a plug for the weekend show.  43 days until Fur Fright 2009.  The update, Sam might go as a blue dragon.  Yes, that is the closest we've gotten to a commitment. 
[00:49:30]  When do we get the commitment?  I don't know when a commitment is coming.  And do you have your tickets for Fur Fright?  No.  Danny, Danny, you're on top of this, right?  Don't let this slide.  I have a boy who is willing to lend you his costume.  I don't want to.  He's going to be attending.  Did you say costume?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  Goodness gracious.  I have a boy who's willing to lend you a spare costume.  I don't want to use.  To attend Fur Fright 2009 in Waterbury, Connecticut.  Will he mind if the coolie hole is cut out of it?  I will ask him. 
[00:50:00]  It won't be.  And I don't want to use costumes.  We could probably sew that back together.  Yeah, yeah.  Afterwards.  After Sam's coming.  He's going.  I'm sure he can give you a ride so you don't even have to worry about transportation.  I'm not taking a ride from anyone.  Dude, supposedly the latest penthouse, I think it is, has a whole fucking article on the furries.  Police.  Oh.  On the furries.  This is a hot thing right now.  Great.  You've got to do what's the haps.  Because this is what is really hot right now.  That's right.  This is what the audience needs to know.  That's right.  There it is.  Do you have your tickets?  No. 
[00:50:30]  And who's going with you?  Iraq?  Yeah, Iraq's going to have to go to this one with me.  Is he going to be in costume?  Of course.  You can't go to Furry Fright without a costume.  Look, motherfucker.  If I have to go fly fishing with Robert Kelly, the least you can do is go to Fur Fright 09 and  have your coolie hole exposed.  Your coolie hole.  And is he going to have...  As you find out what the hell is going on with these people.  Is Iraq going to have his wee-wee out?  Of course he is.  So he'll have his wee-wee out and your coolie hole will be showing.  Iraq's going to be dressed as Pumbaa from The Lion King. 
[00:51:00]  Come on.  Shit.  Do they have to get their tickets in advance, Danny?  I don't want anything to be sold out.  It's strongly recommended.  Then get your fucking tickets, Sam.  Wow, it sells out that fast?  I have to buy tickets.  I'm not buying tickets.  Just buy them.  It's not.  I don't think it's a lot.  We'll reimburse you.  Just get your fucking tickets.  Somebody got to buy them.  At least make an announcement tomorrow that you officially have your tickets for Fur Fright 09.  Somebody better buy them for me.  How much are they?  Trying to find that out.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  We'll have your tickets bought today. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  Then you'll have to go.  There's special deliveries on this weekend, too.  Really?  And midnight on Saturday.  Well, this guy, instead of the wrestling special, Brett in Charlotte, North Carolina,  he's voting for Dead Air Weekend.  Well, guess what?  Can we do Dead Air Weekend?  No.  And we're not talking Grateful Dead, by the way.  We're talking about the just dead air.  It's not up for debate.  It's already been.  It's sponsored and it's set. 
[00:52:00]  WWE Classics On Demand presents the worst of ONA, best of WWE superstars.  What if the deaf pay for Dead Air Weekend?  That's right.  Where it's like, then we can people just pay because it doesn't matter to them.  That could be done another weekend, but not this weekend.  You know what?  These whores that work at this joint, they would actually do that.  They would.  Suggest it.  They would actually take money from a deaf organization to do Dead Air Weekend.  Dead Air Weekend.  Absolute silence on our channel.  To let people know what it would be like to be deaf. 
[00:52:30]  If you tune in to our station and you just don't hear anything.  I knew it was just a matter of time.  Deaf awareness.  Before we went down this road again.  Oh, please.  Jesus.  This is creative marketing.  No, no.  No, it's sales-driven programming, which is always a treat.  Which kind of destroyed regular radio, by the way.  Rectomundo.  I've been around long enough to know where the problems are in this business.  Sales-driven programming.  Sales-driven programming killed regular radio.  There used to be a time where the sales couldn't get their greasy little mitts into the programming aspect of a radio station. 
[00:53:00]  And by the end of our run on regular radio, that's all it was.  But you guys were sales-driven programming.  Every meeting was, how could sales sell this or what you're doing?  And then it got to the point where they weren't even taking things that you were doing on the air and trying to sell them.  They would then just come up with their own fucking creative things that, you know, they're salespeople.  So, Jack, naturally they're hysterical. 
[00:53:30]  Let me let you in on a little secret.  Every person here at SiriusXM wanted to be on the radio.  Yes.  The salespeople, they sucked at college radio, but they still wanted to be in the business, Sam.  Wanted to be.  And what happened?  They still wanted to be in the business.  They decided to start selling for radio stations.  Have to sell.  They can't get out.  So why are they driving programming?  When they failed on their college radio show and failed on their podcast.  I'll be a fucking tank.  I'll sell the fucking thing.  You guys don't have to change what it is that you do. 
[00:54:00]  We're just taking the content that you've already done, interviewing Daito.  My mic again.  Something malfunctioned.  So there's four different levels of registration.  Oh, good.  Thank you, Danny.  Danny, don't let this fucking slide by.  Well, now, there's the regular ticket, which is $30, and that gains you, you get a membership  badge and a program, and you gain admittance to the convention area and all public events.  Oh, that sounds good.  Then on the $55 level. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, that's where the SX is.  You get everything that I previously mentioned.  A lot of coolies will be exposed.  And what is this called?  Well, the first is called the monster level.  Monster level.  Now, this is a zombie sponsor.  Zombie sponsor.  And you get everything as the monster level, but you also get an official, not a bootleg,  an official Fur Fright t-shirt and complimentary entry ticket for their charity raffle.  Oh, wow.  A raffle.  And a shirt.  And then you could do, well, this is even better.  You could do the Franken-sponsor, and that's everything that's included in the monster and 
[00:55:00]  zombie.  But there is a dealer-catered social and a Fur Fright exclusive artwork portfolio that's  yours to keep.  All right, the dealer-catered social, that's where the SX happens, right?  Oh, yeah.  That's the ass-sex level.  The Franken-sponsor is where you start getting things in your coolie.  And that's $90.  But then there is the Casanova Franken-sponsor.  Oh, here it comes.  This is the Bukkake party.  And this is $200.  This is where you're going to need some special cleanser to clean off your fur, because it's 
[00:55:30]  going to be all matted with jizz.  There isn't a dry cleaner in the city that can clean your costume.  You're going to have to cut chunks of it out.  If you're a part of this level.  Yeah, you're going to look like a mangy dog.  Well, I won't.  For the Casanova Franken-sponsor level, at $200, you get all the benefits.  $200?  You get all the benefits of the Monster, Zombie, and Franken-sponsor, but you also get a copy  of the official Fur Fright DVD.  And then this is cryptic, a special gift.  Ah, you know what that is?  The him. 
[00:56:00]  Everyone.  That's a special gift.  And your name.  We could get primetime Sam Roberts listed in the con book.  Damn.  Holy shit.  Printed in the con book.  That is huge.  You guys are going to pay $200.  Oh, yeah.  Just to see what the special gift is.  For this.  And how badly it hurts your coolie.  I'm not putting it in my coolie.  Put your special gift in your coolie hole.  No, I won't.  All right, Danny, slow down.  I mean, I'm willing to give $200.  If there's another level, I'm out.  No, there's not another level, but I have bad news, guys.  What?  It says here, there's a note. 
[00:56:30]  It says, to have your name printed in the con book, all Casanova Franken-sponsors need  to register by August 31st.  Son of a bitch.  Face.  In order to receive your...  So what level could he still get?  Well, he can still get the Casanova Franken-sponsor, but he can't have his name printed in the con  book.  He'll still get the special gift and the official Fur Fright DVD.  He can still go to the Catered Social, get the Fur Fright exclusive artwork portfolio,  be entered into the charity raffle, and the official Fur Fright 09 t-shirt.  In order to receive the special gift, you must register online on or before September 20th. 
[00:57:00]  So we still got time, baby.  Gonna get on that.  Danny.  I don't want this special gift.  I'm leaving this up to you.  You want it.  Because we're gonna forget.  I'm not floating $200 on Christmas.  No, I'm not talking about the money, but make sure that he's got a ticket to this fucking  thing.  Is that code of conduct a link?  Yes.  All right.  Let's see what the code of conduct is.  For Fur Fright 09.  I don't...  Zero tolerance policy.  Uh-oh, Sam.  I can't hang there.  If any time an attendee's behavior violates the code of conduct, the spirit of the guidelines 
[00:57:30]  before, during, or after the convention in real life or online, or if we feel that any  individual is a liability, they will be removed from the convention and or banned from future  events.  Fur Fright takes safety and its relationship with the public and hotel very seriously and  will never allow an individual to endanger our attendees or the welfare of our convention.  If anyone has a problem before, during, or after the con, you'll be violated, blah, blah, 
[00:58:00]  blah, blah.  Okay.  Alcohol, drugs, and public intoxication.  Uh, zero tolerance.  Can't do it.  Got it.  Happens are verboten, forbidden from the convention space and hotel at all times.  Okay.  Public behavior.  Yeah, it's in there.  And then there's public displays of affection.  Public behavior.  Um, no overt public displays of affection, obscene talk, swearing, yelling, roughhousing, or loud  destructive, uh, distractive, destructive behavior, abuse, harassment, unwanted contact, 
[00:58:30]  or stalking behavior that will not be tolerated if we're frightened.  No means no at all times.  No defacing the hotel.  Don't block the hallways, blah, blah, blah.  And public displays of affection when in public areas, uh, hallways, parking lots, balconies,  convention space, et cetera.  Keep your affection rated G.  Remember, hotel staff, non-convention guests, FurFrid attendees, and the general public have  different sensibilities that need to be respected. 
[00:59:00]  Rule of thumb, anytime more than a simple hug and kiss, take it up to your room.  I'm not getting a room.  How much are the rooms at, uh, FurFrid?  It doesn't matter how much the rooms are.  Uh-oh.  What?  Nudity or explicitly revealing costumes are not allowed in public areas.  Sorry.  Of the hotel or convention.  Well, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, you got the tail coming up.  Fursuits are not to be worn in the pool area or restaurant for the safety of the wearer. 
[00:59:30]  Ears, tails, and collars are acceptable accessories.  Shoes, sandals, slippers, or, uh, stocking feet are permitted in the convention area.  However, shoes or sandals are must to be worn at all times in the hotel or the restaurant.  Bare feet are not permitted in public areas.  Uh, noise, room parties.  Let's go to room parties.  Room parties are not sponsored, uh, or condoned by the convention.  Room parties are permitted, but must follow the hotel guidelines, uh, and FurFrid code of conduct at all times. 
[01:00:00]  After 10 p.m., hotel curfew.  All noise music must, uh, be contained within your room.  No noise can bleed through the halls or adjacent rooms.  Doors and balconies and everything must be shut at all times.  Large quantities of alcohol may not be distributed.  No room overcrowding.  All attendees must remain within the room.  Oh, I don't know.  Doesn't sound like much fun.  Well, no, no.  You know why they're putting this?  This is all just legalese. 
[01:00:30]  This is what happens.  These codes of conduct exist because all of this has happened before.  All of this has happened.  It says your flyers for parties must be G-rated because at one time someone handed out flyers that were not G-rated.  It's just giant cocks going in coolie holes through costumes.  Well, it's G-rated now.  It's not going to be any fun.  Sleeping room cleanliness, odors, and trash.  You get sweaty.  Odors and trash must be contained within guest rooms. 
[01:01:00]  If odors and or unbagged trash are found in the halls or outside, odors, ew, like fucking, like fucking shit and jizz.  Oh, water park.  Costumes not allowed in the water park.  No smoking.  Elevator protocol.  What?  All right.  Signs, flyers, decorations.  Minors and parental consent.  You're of it.  You're of it.  You're of it. 
[01:01:30]  Age there.  Security.  I mean, you pray.  Badges.  Video out of photography.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, yes, we need to know that because I would like to get some kind of audio if I'm going to be going.  You can read that one.  That's a long one.  Yeah.  Who needs that?  I mean, that's kind of.  I thought we were doing this for the radio or you're just trying to get me raped.  I want to get you raped.  Oh, OK.  I just totally want you raped.  OK.  Yeah.  This is everything that happens at this fucking convention thing.  Not anymore.  It's against the rules.  And that's why they have to. 
[01:02:00]  The rules are just there.  Lost and found.  Tax deductions for payments made to charitable organizations.  There's a lot going on with this for a Friday or 9.  Where you're just fucking in furry suits.  Yeah.  Jacking off on someone else's fur.  I'm not.  I don't know about this thing.  This must be a huge.  It's a three day long convention.  It must be gigantic.  Woodstock for perverts in fursuits.  I'm not going for three days.  No, you are going.  Let's see how much a room is at the Holiday Inn in Waterbury.  What difference does it make? 
[01:02:30]  Well, you got to get your room.  You got to get a room.  I don't need a room.  I would drive to Connecticut and then drive back home.  No.  You got to stay in the hotel because you're going to some of the room parties.  I'm not going to any room.  You got to go to a room party, dude.  And how are you going to kiss more men because you're not allowed to do that in public?  Yeah.  I'm not going to be doing that.  I don't want to.  No.  Well, it said hugging and kissing.  I'm not going to hug or kiss.  Nick in South Carolina.  Nick?  Hey, I'm just having a hard time trying to shake the furry walk of shame.  Imagine the furry walk of shame. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, that would suck.  That would suck.  Your costume's askew.  Oh, your hiney hurts.  Your coulee hurts.  Sold out, huh, Danny?  Huh, Danny Cakes?  That's right, Danny Hats.  No rooms available.  Oh, boy.  No rooms available.  Wow, we're going to have to go to some neighboring hotel.  No, we're not going to have to go to some neighboring.  You know what?  Even better.  One of our fine listeners will put you up for the weekend.  Yeah.  Oh, he could probably stay with that guy.  Oh, man.  He's going to watch the costume. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  That's not how you say it.  And that would just be great.  I just hope I make it to his place and not just drive home.  Well, our listeners are, you know, good people.  A lot of them are psychopaths.  I'm running a house when I go fly fishing.  So all the listeners can come?  Hell no.  All right, Sam.  You've got a lot to do.  You've got to get your tickets.  You've got to figure out where you're staying.  I'm more focused.  And what day you need to take off because it's a three-day event.  So you're going to have to take, what, Friday off probably? 
[01:04:00]  All right.  You get a Friday off.  How great is that?  Awesome.  Three days.  I'm really more focused on the weekend, this weekend.  I already forgot about that.  It's the worst of O&A, present the best of WWE superstars, brought to you by WWE Classics  on Demand.  Did you guys do the production for that?  We got some liners from the WWE.  Could you please take my name out of it and Anthony's name out of it?  No.  Yeah, please?  Please.  No.  And by the way, there are banners going up on the WWE website with both your names. 
[01:04:30]  I've seen them.  You were talking earlier about the fact that you're coming in here and we won't be in  here and it's whatever the weekend thing is.  Saturday.  Just because I am not home at my house doesn't mean I want someone coming in and shitting  on the floor.  It's not going to be shit on the floor.  This is the equivalent of shit on my floor, what you guys are doing Saturday.  You're shitting in our house.  Incorrect.  This is like when you move and you decide you're not going to sell your place, you're 
[01:05:00]  going to rent your place.  Yeah, yeah.  And you just assume that everything's going to be all nice.  Everything's going to be just the way I left it.  Right.  I'll bet that you guys will tune into this show and be like, oh, that was a riot.  A riot.  Sam.  Think back when, like MVP was on, remember how good that interview was?  Sam.  Talking about jail.  Sam, you know me a little bit.  Yes.  What are the odds that I will be tuning in this horse shit?  Out of how many?  Out of 100?  Yeah.  Zero.  Zero.  Zero.  See?  Are the odds.  And it's a five-hour show?  Yes.  Let me say hi to Chris in Atlanta. 
[01:05:30]  Chris.  Hey, is there any chance you can get sales to have a five-hour energy drink sponsor the  show so we might stay awake for him?  There's no way you guys will go to sleep for it.  Oh, it's going to be action-packed?  Because the wrestlers, when they come on this show, are integrated into the show.  So wrestling fans and Opie and Anthony fans alike, even though there's a lot of crossover  there, will both enjoy it.  You know what we called those interviews over the years?  Excellent.  Filler.  Not filler.  No.  Filler.  Incorrect. 
[01:06:00]  Just another way to get us to 1030 fast.  You guys remember when Mick Foley fed me steak?  Barely.  Barely remember.  Well, we can relive it this weekend.  I would say there's probably a couple of instances.  Maybe the Chris Jericho, Jimmy Norton.  Yes, that's...  Discussion.  Yeah.  That got a little heated.  That is not a five-hour break, by the way, mind you.  That's 20 minutes tops.  It's 20 minutes.  Well, that's part of the show.  And edited with all the shit edited out.  That's making a very good point.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Five hours seems way too long.  Five hours.  And now the other part...  We should have gave him an hour.  Yeah, like an hour.  And the other part is...  Now, how is...  What's his name?  Matt Stryker.  Matt Stryker.  Steve Stryker.  The stream educator.  Now, I could see playing that and someone going, you know something?  I didn't hear this.  It's a little heated argument between Jimmy Norton and Chris Jericho.  I'm going to listen to this.  But how does Matt Stryker now add to this where people are like, thank God Matt Stryker's  here because he's going to be the guy, just like on WWE, when they have the co-host or 
[01:07:00]  the host or whatever the fuck it is that comes out and does nothing but plug.  This guy is going to...  Here's what this guy's job is.  Because they paid for the time.  So, he is going to boringly plug...  What are they selling?  WWE Classics On Demand.  WWE Classics On Demand.  So, every time Matt Stryker opens his mouth, it's going to be, hey, and by the way, don't  forget to pick up blah, blah, blah, where people will just go click. 
[01:07:30]  No, Matt Stryker is entertaining.  I've worked with him in the past on the radio.  How many clickaroos are we going to get?  Oh.  Only click on, click on, click on.  If he does a good job, does Matt Stryker get promoted to SmackDown?  Yeah.  That's not, I mean...  See, when I think wrestling, I really do think SmackDown, Raw...  ECW, I know what you mean.  Nope.  Nope.  I didn't even know ECW was still in existence.  Well, it wasn't, and then it came back as a third brand.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  Why?  But they can't do all the fun stuff they used to do, right?  Well, they can, but they choose not to.  Yeah.  See, because the lawyers got involved.  It's a different product.  It's TVPG.  It's kind of like...  What would ECW stand for?  Technically?  Yeah.  Extreme Championship Wrestling.  Right.  The extreme part...  What's the most extreme thing they do now?  In the past, there was, like, explosions and tacks and...  Well, put to sleep thousands of people on Saturday, apparently.  What's the craziest thing they do now?  There was a situation, I think, last week, where Goldust, who's an ECW superstar now, 
[01:08:30]  fought Sheamus, a giant Irishman, and that match...  Sheamus, the giant Irishman?  Yes.  All right, I gotta see this guy.  And, uh...  Sheamus...  That match ended in a double count-out.  Look at this red-headed douche.  That's him.  He's not a douche.  As far as he is.  Why couldn't we get Sheamus for Saturday?  Anyway, Sheamus is still a rookie.  I'd rather have him. 
[01:09:00]  You want Sheamus to fucking, you know, take some bumps now?  Oh, let's Sheamus.  Look at Sheamus.  Why is James Hetfield wrestling now?  Yeah, that's Sheamus.  He got a little James Hetfield to him.  Hetfield.  With dyed red hair.  Crime Time is still wrestling.  I don't even know you like Crime Time.  I don't even know who that guy is.  I've never heard of Sheamus.  Crime Time?  I don't remember him.  Crime Time is a tag team.  Oh, I told you I didn't know.  Tag team that we discussed.  And they're black guys, right? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, and they steal things.  And they steal stuff.  Yeah.  It's actually spelled with a Y.  All right, well, 43 days before Furry Fright 09.  Yeah.  Or Fur Fright.  What do they call it officially?  Fur Fright 2009.  43 days out, Sam.  Fur Fright.  And you're thinking maybe you're going to go as a blue dragon.  Oh, boy.  An angry dragon or a happy dragon?  Angry.  Angry?  Yeah.  Yeah, fire breathing?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  All right.  Sexy.  We should take our first break.  All right.  Everyone's giving you suggestions on the phone if you want to go answer the phones. 
[01:10:00]  It's all right.  We have interns to do that.  We got people that work for Holiday Inn.  They can get you a room, no problem.  I don't need a room.  They can even get you a discount rate.  I don't live far away from Connecticut.  I don't need a room.  You've got to stay.  You've got to stay.  I don't need a room.  Room party, dude.  I'm not going to a room party.  Room party.  Room party.  Wake up on your belly on the bed, crying.  I'm not going.  Bleeding from the butthock.  Out of my coolio.  You could have some kind of...  Seem like American History X where you're crying to somebody, laying on your stomach. 
[01:10:30]  You could have some kind of Fur Fright lemon party thing going on.  Yeah, you could be the lucky lemon party guy.  With everyone's heads are off.  They're costumes.  I'm not going.  They're costumes.  They only have the body part of their costumes, and their heads are exposed to fillet each other.  I'm not going to a room party.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's in the Overlook Hotel.  The piggy face thing.  Yeah.  Was sucking the dick on the rich socialite. 
[01:11:00]  I don't even want to go to this thing.  I know you have to.  All right.  Very good.  Sure.  Anthony, when we get back.  Yeah.  Mayor Menino.  Oh.  The mayor of Boffiston.  Boffiston.  Debated on live TV last night.  Now, I was very surprised to hear this was his first debate ever as a mayoral candidate.  In 16 years.  And he's been the mayor for 16 fucking years.  Wow.  Yes.  So finally, this might actually get him tossed out.  He was able to avoid live debates because he can't speak. 
[01:11:30]  He is horrid.  Well, we got some fine clips from the debate last night.  Great.  And we're going to do that next.  I did hear that.  This weekend, though.  Yeah.  No, no.  Enough, Sam.  Yeah.  Enough for this weekend.  Most people are going to be at a beach or something.  And then, you know.  With their portable Sirius or XM satellite radios.  I am.  Oh, really?  You can bring them anywhere.  Yeah.  That's the beauty of satellite radio.  Of course it is.  Or if you have the app on your iPhone.  You do anywhere.  Very few commercials, by the way, on the weekend show. 
[01:12:00]  Well, the whole thing is sponsored.  It's one big commercial.  He's going to be talking about this fucking classic goddamn thing.  It's a beautiful service.  It's a service?  It's an on-demand channel.  So, technically, I guess it's a service.  So, what?  You can see old, like, WWF stuff?  Yeah.  Everything.  WWF, WCW, ECW, AWA.  Everything.  So, like, what if I want to see, like, fucking WrestleMania 2?  Well, at some point.  Well, this month is Stone Cold September. 
[01:12:30]  So, you know.  Get out.  Why?  Just get out.  Fucking get out.  Leave the room.  Get out.  Leave the room.  Don't talk shit.  I think you have a read for it later today.  This is what I'm saying.  Get out.  Hey, look.  They understand.  Get out.  We've been talking about it the whole time.  Fuck.  O.B. and Anthony.  Top 500 songs of all time coming in at number 10.  Here's the Who.  It's Labor Day.  Countdown weekend. 
[01:13:00]  You just want to hear some of these songs.  Yeah.  I want to just hear this.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen.  John Entwistle going to town on the base there.  Is John Entwistle coming in anytime soon?  Oh, boy, Anthony.  Oh, that's right.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's too soon.  Too soon.  Too soon.  Billy Mays.  Michael Jackson will be buried today.  That's it.  Will that be on TV? 
[01:13:30]  No.  It's going to be a very, very private.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's going to be a very private event.  They said only family.  Really?  No press, no nothing.  But holy shit, this guy's been above ground for a while for being dead.  Wow.  Finally putting him to rest.  Yes.  The big sleep begins for Michael Jackson today.  The big dirt nap.  Diane Sawyer to take over as anchor for ABC World News.  What happened to Charlie Gibson?  I guess he wasn't getting the job done? 
[01:14:00]  I thought Katie Couric was the one that was not doing that well.  Is she starting to do okay?  No.  Who knows this shit?  If you know this shit, give me a call.  Huh?  I think she's retiring.  Oh, he's retiring?  Nah, come on, Travis.  We've taught you stuff over the years.  He's being forced out.  It's obvious.  It says AP in front of it.  So did Tom Chiasano.  He retired.  Yeah.  Why don't you call Chiasano and ask him if he was retiring anytime soon?  I read that he wants to retire.  He loves his fly fishing, but you know what?  Tom Chiasano still wants to be in the business. 
[01:14:30]  Trust me.  Of course he did.  That was his whole life.  He didn't retire.  CBS threw him the fuck out the door.  And that's what they're doing with Charlie Gibson.  They're pushing him out.  Why?  Ratings down?  Anyone?  I don't know.  And know what was weird about the whole Diane Sawyer?  They're saying they're having her do the evening news to kind of...  They almost used the term sex it up.  Stop it.  She's 60 years old.  I mean, she looks good.  Yes, she looks good for a six-year-old broad.  There's no such thing. 
[01:15:00]  It's just whatever it is.  Let me try to find that ad.  Because I think they said to...  Let me see.  Because there's bees in here.  I can't find the part where they said she's going to sex it up.  Going to sex it up?  Yeah.  Well, they're trying to get the...  This is what's weird.  Sawyer actually...  We say 60.  She's 63.  Gibson, Travis, who's retiring at the age of 66.  Really? 
[01:15:30]  He's retiring?  Every single network anchor guy has been there until he's just about falling apart.  He said he wanted to retire in 2007.  No, he doesn't want to retire.  So he was actually doing a favor.  Can I tell you something?  We have very easy jobs.  Ooh.  We have very easy...  Yeah, Bono without a shirt and without his glasses.  Wow.  Bono's got nice tits.  Holy fucking shit.  He's got some nice bee cups.  What's going on with Bono?  He's living a good life, Ed.  He doesn't need to go to a gym.  If you're Bono, you don't need to go to a gym. 
[01:16:00]  49?  Is he really?  He kind of looks like Ricky Gervais.  Yeah.  Holy shit, he does.  I love the Bono.  But he's got to keep his shirt on.  Wow.  That'll open up options for my brother's 2U band.  Now it doesn't matter if his Bonos are fat.  So don't be fooled.  Gibson either wasn't getting the job done.  Well, most likely wasn't getting the job done. 
[01:16:30]  And they're going to move Diane Sawyer in there.  There's something about his penis, apparently.  Because they're going for a vagina.  Yeah.  A dried up one, albeit.  You think the three major networks will all have broads doing the evening news for us?  Yeah.  Because now we've got two out of three.  Who's the third?  I don't even...  It's...  Wait.  It's...  Brian Williams.  Yes.  Who took over for Tom Brokaw.  No, Brian Williams ain't going anywhere.  No.  He's doing good, I think.  I would imagine he's the top dog in that arena. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  So you got that going on.  And something that I think is a about-time story.  YouTube to offer online movie rentals.  They're in negotiations with all the major movie studios, I believe.  Yeah.  And in the very near future, you'll be able to just rent movies on YouTube.  I'm still not digging on YouTube's quality.  They got the HD thing.  It's not that bad.  I know.  It's getting there.  No?  No?  No. 
[01:17:30]  Pixelated and fucked up.  Well, dude, they upload a billion videos a day.  What do you want from that?  Believe me.  If this was like...  I'm kind of impressed with what they do on a daily basis.  If this was a few short years ago, I'd be going, oh my God, this is the best video  I've ever seen online.  Right.  But...  We do want quality.  Yeah.  We want quality so bad.  Some news sites, it's amazing now.  It's just very fluid, nice.  Just high def, real nice.  Real nice.  Speaking of which, did you hear, I think it's Sony? 
[01:18:00]  I forgot which company.  But they're going to be offering 3D TVs in the very near future?  Like, when?  That's Sony.  I think they want to start introducing them next year.  Next year.  3D TVs.  Finally, Ralph Cramden's dream comes from.  And Travis was all over this the other day.  He was very excited about the...  I think it's Philips that's offering the CinemaScope 21.9 widescreen.  Wow.  Meanwhile, there's no aspect ratio.  There's no programming that's available in 21.9.  And so I don't see what the point of a 21.9 television is. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, that is a little crazy.  You get on the bandwagon early, though.  You know what?  Early.  When you see a square TV, it just throws you off now.  I'll just go over to Sam's house.  And you'll see fucking E-Rock's old piece of shit TV over there, I believe.  When did we decide we like rectangles over squares, by the way?  What year?  And why couldn't we decide we like rectangles over squares a long time ago?  Bandwidth.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's all about fucking signals.  And for us to... 
[01:19:00]  And I bitch about this all the time.  To sit there and watch a movie, especially when you get a movie on demand, and don't realize  that it's in 4-3 ratio, it drives me insane.  Yeah.  You put it on, and you're like, why am I fucking watching this?  Because eight people still have fucking cathode ray tube televisions.  Oh, it's annoying as shit.  And one of them is our own stupid Sam. 
[01:19:30]  Poor Sam.  16.9.  It's fine.  And Oprah to dedicate a show to Michael Jackson, whatever.  And...  My theater screen.  And study shows that prime time on the internet is 11 p.m.?  What does that mean?  It's where most people's wives have gone to bed, and the hubbies can fucking jack out  a batch, and then go to bed.  Guaranteed, more porno at that hour.  My latest thought is this.  No matter who you are, I'm talking to the men out there. 
[01:20:00]  No matter who you are...  Gentlemen.  And who you think you are.  This was my thought walking home from the gym yesterday.  We're all going to end up in front of computers jerking off at the end of our lives.  At some point?  At some point, that's what it's going to come down to.  Yeah.  Jerking off in front of the computer.  Well, I'm already in that club.  I don't know anybody who isn't.  Even if you're in a happy relationship, a happy marriage, I think it all ends with you 
[01:20:30]  as an old guy in front of a computer, jacking off.  Oh, God.  Just jerking off as an old guy?  That's my latest thought.  On a computer?  Yeah.  I couldn't even tell you when I first was introduced to the internet, as we know it.  By the way, happy birthday to the internet.  Yes.  Internet is 40.  Yes.  40 years old.  I think yesterday was the official day.  I think they got it wrong in the paper today.  Because I saw TV, the TV was all over this anniversary yesterday. 
[01:21:00]  Maybe they were saying tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  Good point.  We don't have the sound on in here, so you know what?  It doesn't even matter.  You could be right.  But apparently, yeah, two computers had a little chat with each other 40 years ago,  and that started the internet and started us jacking off.  What was the conversation?  We could do this gag.  This is probably a morning zoo bit.  Oh, oh, oh.  Got any pics?  Yeah.  But when I first...  Any JPEGs?  Yeah, where's... 
[01:21:30]  You've got mail.  Oh, wow.  There's nothing better than going into some rooms and...  Old school.  And then you'd put up some pictures.  Old school, right.  You'd send some pictures out, and then you'd hear,  You've got mail.  You've got mail.  You've got mail.  You're like, oh, I got three of them.  Now let me download them and see what it is.  Then it would slowly, from top to bottom, be like, yeah, nice one.  It was like trading baseball cards.  Yep.  Got her.  You had to give a little bit.  Neater, got her, neater, neater.  You had to give a little to get.  Yep.  You did. 
[01:22:00]  But man, and that was the days of the wild, wild west.  Oh, yeah.  When you heard you got mail, whoa.  You've got mail.  You didn't know what you were going to say.  Here it comes.  What is it?  But when I, when that first fucking came around, I was, I was like, oh my God, this is amazing.  Just like a monkey.  Like a monkey.  But now, it's just unbelievable 40 years later.  Now you're, you know, going free porno videos and everything.  Hey, uh, top online searches for today. 
[01:22:30]  We, we don't really pay attention to this usually.  Whitney Houston's up there, obviously, because she just hacked it up on, uh, Good Morning America.  Yeah.  Apparently, we didn't hear that.  No.  I guess it wasn't that bad.  But the Rolling Stones is the number one search today.  Why?  Travis, I'm going to go to you on that one.  Uh, it might be because, aren't they reinvestigating?  They're investigating the death of, uh, what's his name?  Um, Brian.  Brian, uh, I was going to say, I was going to say Brian Wilson. 
[01:23:00]  It's Brian Jones.  Brian Jones.  Right.  Yeah.  Drowning in his pool years ago.  They think it might be a murder?  They think it.  Oh, you know what it is?  It's that, uh, there's rumors that Charlie Watts quit.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He didn't quit?  No, I know.  They deny it.  He's being pushed out.  There's a girl called Abigail in the pool.  No one quits.  People get pushed out.  Yeah.  Charlie Watts probably has horrendous arthritis in his knuckles, and they need a new drummer  to keep up with Mick.  Didn't he have the big casino recently? 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  I think it did.  Charlie Watts quit.  You think, uh, the Rolling Stones will be one of those bands that just continues forever?  As long as, uh, Mick, uh, is there.  Well, you also, I guess, yeah.  I mean, there's too much money to be made from, uh, you know, the trademark, you know,  the Rolling Stones.  Yeah, yeah.  So you got to think, even when Mick is gone, this band continues somehow.  No, no.  No way.  Why not?  No way.  There's other bands pretty much doing that now.  You might be able to, eh. 
[01:24:00]  Dude, I saw the Allman Brothers recently.  Three out of the ten people on that stage were original members.  Really?  Three.  And Greg Allman plays part-time now.  Oh, really?  Just kind of pops in when he wants to?  No, he walks off.  Oh, he walks off the stage?  He actually walks off, and Bruce Hornsby, all of a sudden, was playing the Greg Allman part  for a while.  What the fuck is that about?  Who wants to see that?  Unbelievable.  And the other two guys are, like, drummers. 
[01:24:30]  Jesus.  No one on guitar is an original member in the Allman Brothers anymore.  And Greg Allman, he actually, like, you know, takes a break.  I think if Mick Jagger has to be in the Rolling Stones.  Keith Richards, too.  But I think even if Keith, like, dropped dead, if they picked up a popular guitarist that  already has a name, they could probably keep going as long as Mick's still there.  Once Mick's done, it's over.  It's not like a, it's like the Who continuing without Daltrey kind of a thing. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, but they could do some kind of, like, almost make it like a tribute to the Rolling  Stones, and then they'd start dropping the word tribute, because some bands do that now.  Oh, yeah.  And all of a sudden, it's now the band again.  Right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  There was another fine home run call last night from John Sterling.  And once again, I ask America, is there another sports announcer out there doing this horse 
[01:25:30]  shit?  Yeah.  And so far, we got one guy calling about the Penguins, the Pittsburgh Penguins announcer,  but we didn't really find any good stuff.  Right, Danny?  There's a clip on YouTube.  Maybe the guys down the hall could get that if it's worth playing on the air.  Because I don't want to just make it all about John Sterling, even though he's the  worst.  He is absolutely the worst.  My Twitter went nuts last night because, what's his name?  Henske?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I guess Henske hit another homer.  Henske.  Henske.  And my Twitter exploded. 
[01:26:00]  Henske.  Henske?  Henske.  Henske.  Okay.  Yeah.  In the third inning, Henske hit a home run.  And I was just like going, thank God Henske hit another one because I cannot stand what  John Sterling said.  What did we learn yesterday?  Henske with your...  It was Henske with your best shot.  And he was overdramatic with it.  And he goes, oh, Henske with your best shot. 
[01:26:30]  As if it's hit me with your best shot.  Well, Henske hit another homer last night.  Yeah.  Yankees win again?  Yes, the Yankees won.  Damn these guys.  Wait.  The Yankees win.  I see you throwing your arms up in the air.  Yeah, I have to do it.  Like you're just okay there.  I never knew how he did it.  I always go, the, or the, but now all you got to do is shake your arms.  He makes very weak fists.  The Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  What a tool.  I'd have to get that on video for everybody. 
[01:27:00]  So, Yankees beat the Orioles.  Damn.  Yeah, they're on a pretty good streak.  What are the six games?  You think the Yankees win the World Series this year?  Seven and a half ahead of the Sox who lost.  Are you feeling it or what?  I'm feeling it, man.  They have pitching and fucking hitting this season.  Come on.  And us Mets fans, all we care about is that ridiculous helmet that David Wright is wearing.  Did you see this thing?  Yeah.  Did you see that? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, on a little news clip.  And they're also saying that the new Shea Stadium, I call it the new Shea Stadium, City  Field, really hard to get home runs going.  It's a jinx.  So now they're saying, should they move the fences in?  Oh, great.  And so far they're saying, absolutely not.  We're not moving the fences in.  That's great.  Look at that big dopey helmet.  We're lowering the wall.  Look at that big stupid helmet.  Fucking Google David Wright's helmet.  That's like the fucking Dukakis tank helmet.  What is he doing?  He looks like the Great Kazoo.  He's got a big fucking.  The Great Kazoo is playing for the Mets now. 
[01:28:00]  Or the hiney-headed aliens from Star Trek.  Yes.  The fuck is that?  That looks ridiculous.  Well, the Mets pretty much look like a baseball team whose plane crashed on their way to a  game.  Like, they're just all fucked up.  So they really are done.  Yeah, they're done.  Donski.  So Hinski hit another homer, and here's John Sterling.  And I hear it's even worse than yesterday's Hinski home run call. 
[01:28:30]  The payoff.  There goes the deep right center.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  He's done it again.  Eric Hinski.  Ah, Hinski with your best shot.  Eric Hinski drills into the right center field bleachers and ties the ball game at one.  Oh, he doesn't have any confidence in this.  No, he was trying to almost sing it.  He almost had a sing song.  He'd think, oh, Hinski with your best shot. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, fire away right at his head.  Why doesn't the organization tell him to stop?  I guess that means there's more people that enjoy the John Sterling home run call.  I can't even imagine that.  Because if public opinion was such where they hated it, the organization would say, stop.  No one really says they hate it, except us.  Why?  Somebody tolerated.  Somebody over at CBS loves it, I guess, because that's like part of the opening.  Like when Yankee baseball starts, like there's John Sterling calls that kind of open the game. 
[01:29:30]  Why do we see things so differently than everybody else?  I don't get that.  The only thing I regret is that Jimmy Norton isn't here to hear that one because we haven't,  he hasn't heard Hinski with your best shot yet.  What's wrong with you?  Tuesday, that's the first thing we do for him.  Oh, I know.  When he's back.  Every Hinski.  Oh, absolutely.  Hopefully Hinski will keep knocking him out of the park.  The best part about Jimmy, he just gets so mad.  He gets legitimately angry. 
[01:30:00]  He just starts me laughing.  He gets so mad over this stuff.  What the fuck is he doing?  And wrapping up, I guess, the sports thing, Curt Schilling.  Remember good old Curt Schilling?  Of course.  He has some interest in taking Ted Kennedy's seat in the Senate.  Yeah.  What does he know about politics?  Is it that easy to be a politician?  And if it is, when are you running?  Yeah, I know, right?  I think he's a Republican.  Yeah.  He's a Republican. 
[01:30:30]  And he's had his opinions out there in the press in the past.  So, I mean, what the fuck?  But if he thinks a Republican is going to be able to win a seat in Massachusetts,  he's out of his goddamn mind.  But Curt Schilling is, first of all, not for Massachusetts.  He played for about 10 baseball teams.  Yeah.  People forget quickly.  He played for everybody.  But he was the big hero with the fucking period foot.  Let's not forget period foot.  Yes, old period foot. 
[01:31:00]  So, you know, dark helmet.  Are you punching up a picture of a dark helmet from Spaceball?  Yeah.  There's David Wright's fucking batting helmet.  What is the logic behind David Wright's giant helmet?  It's because like a week and a half or two weeks ago, he got hit in the head with a fastball.  Yeah.  So now he feels that he has to protect more of his head.  More of his head. 
[01:31:30]  And they called it a ridiculous helmet.  It's so big.  David Wright says he will keep wearing ridiculous looking new helmet.  It looks like it weighs down his head.  Yeah.  He's like a bobblehead doll.  It's a life-size bobblehead.  Baseball bobblehead.  He looks like he should be on a short bus.  Does he take a short bus to Citi Field now?  The first paragraph of this article from NJ.com says,  The other players didn't need to say anything.  As soon as David Wright walked anywhere near his teammates or Rockies players Tuesday, 
[01:32:00]  he could see it in their faces.  Quote,  They just started laughing at me, Wright said.  Ah, shit.  Ah, nice.  Let me say hi to Jerry in New Jersey.  Jerry?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Jerry.  I want to let you know,  Francesca does a bit daily of the hilarity of John Sterling's calls.  Oh, he does?  Oh, really?  They basically just laugh out loud at him and replay his calls.  It's basically the same thing you guys are doing.  Trying to figure out how the hell did this man come up with this crap. 
[01:32:30]  And then they also pat him on the back a little bit because apparently,  you know, people love to hate him.  So he's not going anywhere anytime soon.  He's winning Emmys with that Yankeeography stuff.  Amazing.  He's on top of the world.  But everyone's laughing at him.  At everybody.  Well, when you're a sports announcer,  you're not supposed to make it about yourself,  which John Sterling's doing.  We've said this point many, many times.  If something natural comes out,  like the famous Al Michaels call,  there's a bunch of them you can go to, 
[01:33:00]  then fine.  But he's at home actually thinking up this stuff.  And he's got his, you know,  It is far.  It is far.  It is far.  So, you know,  I understand that.  I mean,  everyone has sort of their home run call,  but then he,  that's where it should end.  To have a dumb nickname for every player and use it when they fucking jack one out of the park is silly.  Not only that,  but he's a,  you know,  if you listen to baseball,  you know,  the deal,  it's supposed to go an inning on,  inning off.  You share with your,  with your color commentator. 
[01:33:30]  Then maybe they call,  but you know,  the guys that are really whores will maybe let their color guy do two innings or three.  Susan Waldman doesn't get the sniff.  Thank God though.  Cause the only thing worse than him is Susan Waldman.  I can't listen to her.  But wouldn't that be great for us?  Just to hear her try to call an inning and John sitting there just playing in.  You got a point.  That would be,  that would be all right.  That would kind of be fun.  That would be all right.  He wouldn't let her get a word in.  No way.  Yeah.  He would just take over.  He would just take over and say,  okay,  Susan, 
[01:34:00]  nevermind.  I got it.  I got it.  And why don't we have more Susan Waldman audio?  We really should.  That was the only time she lost her mind.  There's got to be more Susan Waldman audio worth bringing to the show.  Ever since,  ever since she had an orgasm when Clemens showed up,  they shut her up.  Yeah.  They just fucking told her to shut the fuck up.  You sounded like an idiot.  That was really bad for her.  Oh,  goodness gracious.  That was a jumping the shark moment for Susan Waldman.  It was.  Cringe.  All right.  Thank you,  Jerry.  All right.  Yep. 
[01:34:30]  Jerry.  Let me say,  no.  All right.  We lost them.  Okay.  You want to take a quick break so we can clear the field for the Mayor Menino audio?  Clear the field.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  I think we,  we hit the headlines today.  Ted Kennedy says in post,  humus,  how did,  posthumous.  Posthumous,  right.  Posthumous.  Posthumous.  God,  I got a little Ridge Voss in me today.  Ted Kennedy says in posthumous,  of course,  memoir,  memoir.  He's remorseful over Chappaquinick.  I'm remorseful. 
[01:35:00]  Good for you.  How about you say it when you were alive?  How about that?  How about you fucking would have,  if you would have said that when you were kicking?  Yeah.  Didn't have a boulder in your head.  And if we're missing any headlines,  you guys call us up and help us out with that.  I know.  How are the fires in L.A.?  They're pretty much done.  They're out.  For real?  Yeah.  They got them under control?  Yeah,  they got them under control.  There's no real big fires anymore.  And they're saying humans caused this.  Yeah,  of course.  Not sure if it was accidental or arson.  You got something?  Yeah,  big story. 
[01:35:30]  I'll be on Red Eye tonight.  Nice.  Ha ha,  Fox News.  Nice.  Red Eye,  of course it's on at three in the morning,  but DVR it.  DVR that motherfucker.  And watch your pal Ant on Red Eye.  I think we're trying to get Andy Levy in today.  Yeah.  Because Patrice was supposed to stop in,  but he's got some stuff he's got to take care of today.  What's he doing?  Who knows?  We'll get him in soon,  though,  because we love Patrice on this show.  But Andy Levy might stop in.  Might pop his head in and say hi.  Yeah,  that'd be fun.  And we got the Guar guy. 
[01:36:00]  What's his name?  Optimus Prime.  Not Odorous.  Is it Odorous?  Is it pronounced Odorous?  Orungus.  All right,  I'm sorry,  and I'm laughing at you.  I'm going to call him Optimus Prime.  Odorous will be in here at nine.  I hear he's a character.  I hear he does very good radio.  Really?  He better.  Yeah,  he'll do all right.  Is he the guy with the spikes on his shoulders and stuff?  Let me pull up a picture for you guys.  All right.  Hang on one moment,  please.  Dark Helmet.  Dark Helmet is still up there. 
[01:36:30]  David Wright.  Stupid David Wright.  Let's see.  It's this guy.  Ah.  Do you know what he...  Is he going to be in his full regalia?  Yes,  that was actually one of the points that were being made of why we should have...  Well,  he'll wear his whole costume.  Yes.  It's wonderful.  He's cut out his coolie hole.  Do you know their music?  Oh my God,  that guy?  No.  No,  no.  It's not really...  It's Gwar,  for Christ's sake.  It's Gwar.  Yeah,  but Gwar has a following.  Yeah, 
[01:37:00]  but it's pretty much the show,  and no one really buys Gwar albums.  I think you go to see the live shows.  Well,  they do have a new album coming out.  Travis,  tell me before the show.  Yeah,  their new album came out last week,  and I believe it debuted at number 96.  You have to name...  You have to tell us the name of the album,  because I guarantee it's going to be kind of like...  Well,  it sold 5,000 copies.  I like how he painted in abs,  and they're really badly painted in.  It's like Strong Bad. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Oh,  this is going to be hysterical.  Come on.  Yeah.  How does he...  He's not going to have that whole face makeup shit on,  is it?  That looks like it takes forever,  unless it's a mask.  Dude,  he's putting on his costume right now.  Oh,  it's a mask.  His costume.  He'll be in full costume.  Wow.  The new album is called Lust in Space.  Oh,  I get it.  And it's...  And apparently he talks about politics and shit,  dressed up like that.  He's well-versed,  and I guess... 
[01:38:00]  He'll make you sound like a liberal.  Really?  Yeah,  he's hardcore.  Well,  that's good.  Hardcore Republican.  Hardcore all the way.  I was like cringing.  Why does he got a penis thing?  He's got a giant schween cover.  It's like some kind of devil thing.  They're just...  I hope he doesn't show up with the penis.  I hope he does.  I hope he does.  If he does,  we're going to make Sam kiss it.  Oh. 
[01:38:30]  He's going to make me sound like a liberal.  That's what people were telling me on Twitter last night.  That's a little difficult to do.  I was so pissed off driving in,  I heard fucking Bloomberg.  Yeah,  what's Bloomberg up to?  He's got his fucking schnoz in gun issues.  He wants to...  Now,  on the outside,  this sounds reasonable and logical,  but...  As I see it,  it's unnecessary.  He wants a no carry while you're drinking policy, 
[01:39:00]  where if you're caught carrying a sidearm on you legally,  and you're drinking over some level,  I don't know,  they haven't even said what they deem being intoxicated is for having to carry a weapon,  it will be illegal.  I have to tell you,  it sounds reasonable.  Yeah.  On the surface.  It sounds reasonable on the surface.  What's the problem?  The problem is,  give me some fucking statistics, 
[01:39:30]  you fucking mayor piece of shit.  How many people in New York City,  because he doesn't control the state,  it's just city,  citywide.  How many people citywide,  legal gun owners,  that have a license to carry concealed,  I'm not talking about thugs,  who are illegally carrying guns,  accidentally shoot people while they're drunk?  I want the fucking stats.  I want to know how big a problem this is,  that he's got to fucking legislate again,  against legal gun owners. 
[01:40:00]  I got to say,  it must be a tiny number.  Dude,  it's got to be nothing,  that there's drunk people,  wielding weapons around shooting.  You know who's drunk,  and stoned,  and fucking shooting each other?  Criminals.  That's who's doing it.  And missing their targets,  and hitting kids?  Criminals,  who are already illegal.  Stop legislating against legal gun owners.  And of course,  he wants to outlaw armor-piercing bullets,  which,  you know,  again,  are,  I thought they were illegal. 
[01:40:30]  But,  he wants to outlaw those.  I don't really need those,  to tell you the truth.  They're probably fun to shoot,  at big metal plates.  If you outlaw those,  I mean,  people are going to get their hands on them anyway.  Of course.  Then,  then only the bad people have them.  See,  I've learned a lot from you.  It's,  it's,  it's the word,  they just,  I used to be the get rid of gun guy.  Yeah,  they just legislate against legal gun owners,  because they can't do anything about the illegal guys.  I understand the issue a lot,  a lot better because of you.  It's,  it's just abominable that this guy,  uh,  is putting his schnoz in this, 
[01:41:00]  uh,  this whole thing.  Oh,  it's annoying the piss out of me.  Oh,  great.  Uh,  odorous,  uh,  we got more info on odorous.  Odorous.  Odorous.  Uh,  costume.  Uh,  Mark in Massachusetts.  Mark.  Hey,  how's it going?  Hey.  Hey,  so I've seen guar like four or five times,  and this guy's like costume has like a prosthetic dick in it that sprays fake jizz with some pneumatic like pressurized system.  All right.  Who gets squirted with jizz today on our show? 
[01:41:30]  E-Rock.  Yeah,  E-Rock.  Of course.  We haven't heard from E-Rock since coming back from break.  No.  E-Rock gets jizz in the face today.  Holy shit.  We got to make that happen.  Oh my God.  Would that be fantastic?  Thank you for that,  Mark.  That's all I got.  And if he's listening,  he better bring in the,  the apparatus that shoots the jizz.  Yes,  bring your jizz.  I'm sure he's,  I'm sure he's got a box of stuff that like screws onto the crotch of this thing,  because I've seen with like four different fucking things.  Okay.  Every time I see him in concerts,  they got like a heroin needle and shit. 
[01:42:00]  Fucking crazy.  Nice.  I'm looking forward to the guy.  I hear he does a really good radio and I hear he's really good on red eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I've never seen,  I was supposed to watch those clips.  You were supposed to watch those clips.  Please.  I slept till six last night.  Who has time for that crap?  Show prep.  What's that?  I don't know.  Mitch,  White Plains.  Mitch.  Hey,  what's up guys?  Hey man.  Nothing.  Listen,  Anthony,  man,  he's not really going after the legal gun owners.  He's probably just adding a charge for the stupid practical,  versus in Sean Diddy Combs of the world. 
[01:42:30]  No,  no,  it's not.  He's talking about legally,  legal gun owners that have permits to carry firearms,  that you will get a like carrying while intoxicated charge if you're carrying your gun legally and you're drinking.  Now,  like I said,  on the outside,  it sounds good because you don't want somebody drunk wielding a gun around.  But the fact of the matter is,  I want to,  I want to see statistics. 
[01:43:00]  I want to see how many people are killed and not people breaking into their house or trying to jack their car and the guy happens to be drunk and shoots the guy legitimately.  I want to know how many people are killed tragically by firearms, by legally owned guns that are being carried legally, but the guy is intoxicated, which is, you know, based on, let's say,  a Dewey, you know, 0.08 or, or higher. 
[01:43:30]  Actually,  he's not going after these club,  these club guys who just carry guns because they just got to protect their bling and stuff.  Yeah.  All right.  Law would use the same definition of intoxication as the legal limit for driving.  Let me tell you something.  I could fucking put a grouping in center target at probably a 0.1.  Don't you shoot better when you've had,  you've had a few?  Oh,  loosens you up a little bit.  Sure.  Yeah,  you practice drunk though,  don't you?  actually it says,  right?  And you know,  you should know as a gun owner,  a responsible gun owner, 
[01:44:00]  you should know you're not,  you're not firing your weapon when you're drinking.  It's not,  you know that.  And again,  it's a constitutional right.  He said,  it's the same thing.  The mayor actually said,  he goes,  carrying while intoxicated should be the same thing as driving while intoxicated.  Driving again is a privilege in this country.  It is a privilege that is doled out and can be taken away from you.  Without any rights to you or anything.  Gun ownership and actually bearing the arm, 
[01:44:30]  which is carrying the arm is a constitutional right,  which cannot be taken away from you.  How about drunk talking?  Freedom of speech,  first amendment.  How about you get the first amendment and get people drunk while talking?  That's actually in certain cases,  I would appreciate that.  That's because some people really babble like assholes when they,  when they're drunk.  And I've had it.  I've been away for a long time.  Oh my God.  You can genuinely go away for a long time.  Yeah.  I had a line from the compound joke too. 
[01:45:00]  And I don't think intoxication should infringe on,  on your right.  I mean,  what other,  what other right is infringed upon by,  by,  by drinking?  But I think you're just trying to get these guns out of these clubs.  I mean,  that's the,  that's the main issue.  I think.  Who gives a shit?  We're not in these clubs.  You know what?  You know,  you know,  I understand that.  I don't need Bob in the club.  People are firing off weapons drunk in the club.  That's one thing.  If they're firing off weapons and they're illegal guns,  they're illegal anyway. 
[01:45:30]  So whether he's drunk or not,  the guy's going to fucking jail.  If you're a legal gun owner and you're blowing a 0.08,  it doesn't matter that maybe if someone tries to jack your car on the way out  that you can't now carry because you've had a couple of beers,  fuck yourself.  That's what I say.  That's my opinion.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Have a good day.  Thanks,  man.  Jim in New York,  if law passes,  lots of cops will go to jail.  Yeah,  right.  We'd love our,  our cop friends. 
[01:46:00]  Responsible police officers put their guns away.  Of course.  Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Hey,  what's up,  both?  How are you doing?  Pretty good,  Rob.  Did you hear the Y.E.  Yang call when he beat Tiger that the announcer was sitting on for at least the last six holes?  It was Y.E.  S.  Oh,  really?  Can we get that down the hole?  Ew.  You guys ruined it for me.  Oh,  I had to turn it off.  It was terrible.  It was zoiks.  During our break,  Tiger Woods,  which one was it? 
[01:46:30]  The PGA championship,  right?  PGA,  yeah,  yeah.  When I was like,  and he loses to this Y.E.  Yang guy who was like ranked out on 180 in the world or something.  Tiger has a nice,  comfortable lead and completely fucking blows it.  And this guy was like,  he had,  he had fucking ice water in his veins.  Yeah.  This guy just kicked Tiger's ass.  They said his career earnings were something like 200,000.  He won 1.7 for that.  That's when it went along.  Dude,  this was one of the biggest sports stories over the break.  I know you hate golf and all that, 
[01:47:00]  but this was a biggie.  This was a biggie.  Him choking,  I mean.  Choking,  and then you got this guy,  he's an Asian golfer.  Now,  you know,  the Asian golf world is out of their minds.  Oh boy.  Now they're going to start chopping down all sorts of stuff to make golf courses.  Plowing over neighborhoods just because this guy won.  That's how it works.  That guy's punching out.  That was a good one.  Yeah,  I'm going to try to find that.  Thanks,  Rob.  Cool,  man.  All right,  we'll,  we'll break.  Also,  we're going to do the Mayor Menino debate that was live on TV last night in Boston.  Got some fine, 
[01:47:30]  fine highlights from that.  And I want to discuss the word shorty.  Shorty as in the urban lingo?  Yes.  All right.  I have someone that comes over the house once a week to clean up a little bit.  Uh-huh.  A little bit,  a little bit.  Uh-huh.  And she enjoys her music.  Right.  So as I'm playing Tiger Woods 10,  I crank up some of these,  I don't know,  stations on SiriusXM that I didn't even know were there. 
[01:48:00]  Some hip hop?  Maybe.  Oh,  boy.  Every other fucking song has the word shorty in it.  Really?  Enough with shorty.  I thought that was kind of a passe word.  That's what I was sort of thinking.  Yeah.  They still do the club and the club and the shorty.  Yeah.  And every song is about shorty,  though.  We should do maybe a montage of shorty.  We'll get into that after the break, too.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:48:30]  We're looking at Odorous's bio there,  and you noticed a couple fine little tidbits about Odorous that we did not know.  Quite amazing.  Did you know Odorous is the lead singer of Guar, of course?  According to Guar Mythos,  Odorous is 43 billion years old, Opie.  He was assembled on the planet Scumdogia.  His father was reportedly a supercomputer,  and his mother a Petri dish. 
[01:49:00]  He also ate Jerry Springer on a stage once.  Let's not forget.  And he's going to be on Red Eye with you, Anthony.  He better be in the newsroom.  What does that mean?  Well, that's when you get relegated to downstairs. 
[01:49:30]  By yourself?  Yeah.  You sit in a stool.  What the fuck is that about?  Where people are milling about doing work,  and you sit on a stool with a light and a camera and a monitor.  Why can't they squeeze you in with the big boys?  Well, usually they do,  but last time I was there,  they had a last-minute guest,  which was one of the Fox News guys.  Right.  So he had to sit up there because he works for Fox News.  No, I understand that,  but why can't they just make room for everybody?  That makes it hard.  If you're in a studio by yourself,  as everyone else is having fun upstairs or wherever they are, 
[01:50:00]  that's got to be a hard thing to do.  I'm just looking at him.  It's a series of poker,  and apparently there's some kind of law  against wearing weird masks on your head.  I tried to explain to them this is my real face.  They shot me up with elephant tranquilizer  and threw me in the back alley.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  That's rough.  That is excellent.  I haven't seen a collection of degenerates  and weirdos as vast  since the last Republican convention. 
[01:50:30]  That's good, huh?  So were you mobbed while you...  Have you been mobbed while you're there  by adoring fans?  No.  They drove me about 40 miles outside of town  and dropped me in the desert.  They're trying to pretend I'm not even here.  After the show is over,  I'm walking back down to the Rio  and I'm going to kill everyone.  That guy's coming in, huh?  All right.  Oh, my God.  We'll have fun with him.  I'll agree to this.  Red Eye Tonight. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, I didn't.  We both did it.  Jesus, okay.  Look at the video.  We thought Patrice was going to be here.  Yeah, see,  maybe we should take people inside the show again.  We booked the guar guy  because we thought Patrice would just make fun of him.  And now it's just me and Ant with the guar guy.  I think so.  Now what?  Someone's getting shot with jizz today, though.  We know that.  They call him interplanetary correspondence?  Hey, is E-Rock around?  Will he agree to the jizz thing?  I'm sure he is. 
[01:51:30]  Officially.  E-Rock's a team player.  Well, where's E-Rock?  Oh, yeah.  He's in the office.  If he could come down here  because we've got to explain the jizz thing to him.  I guess the guar guy has a huge, like,  penis apparatus thing that shoots jizz.  Yeah.  And we want E-Rock to take one in the face.  How did...  I'm just wondering how people worked on the news  as Odorous was doing that  because he's in a room where people are milling about.  Yes.  Here comes E-Rock. 
[01:52:00]  Take your time, E-Rock.  I love the people that slowly walk down the hall.  You know what kind of pressure we have on a daily basis  in front of live microphones?  The least you can do is get down here quickly and help us out.  I'm told that penis apparatus thing,  it actually has its own name.  It's called the Cuttlefish of Cthulhu.  I don't know why, but that's the official name.  E-Rock.  Yes, sir.  So the Cuttlefish of what?  Cthulhu.  Cthulhu.  Shoots fake jizz. 
[01:52:30]  Would you take a load in the face?  As a short note, it's fake.  Like I have a choice in this.  Of course I'm going to have to do this.  Well, we'll ask him what the jizz is made out of.  I'm sure he's been working on...  Made of jizz!  It's probably his own jizz he just collects.  What do you think he makes his jizz out of?  He's probably been working on this recipe for a long time.  I think a lot of people make it out of like...  Lotion.  Corn syrup.  Mm-hmm.  And like icing.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:53:00]  We got the recipe once from Penthouse.  What they use.  Yeah, I forgot what they said.  Yeah, I forgot too.  That means we need a memory.  Yeah.  Stupid memory.  Who needs one of those?  Oh, look at that.  All right.  Well, you're going to take the jizz in the face then?  I guess I have to.  It's not real jizz.  Chill out.  Yay, E-Rock.  All right, back to work.  He looks silly.  Hey, Pittsburgh Penguins announcer Mike Lang.  We finally got his calls to see if they're as douchey as John Sterling. 
[01:53:30]  I doubt it, but we'll give it a try.  Oh, scratch my back with a hacksaw.  Scratch my back with a hacksaw?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Jaromir Jagr and the big ones have the lead.  Four to three, and he smoked them like a bad cigar.  And he smoked them like a bad cigar.  He smoked them like a bad cigar. 
[01:54:00]  Okay, so he uses that one a lot.  He likes that one, huh?  Smoked them like a bad cigar.  Now, wait a minute.  Why would you smoke a bad cigar?  If he smoked them, he would smoke them like a good cigar, which is like you're really  enjoying the smoke.  You're really taking in the smoke.  You're really smoking it.  Right.  A bad cigar, you don't smoke that much.  You take a couple of puffs and go, this sucks.  Maybe he smoked them quick.  Maybe bad cigars burn quick.  You're just speculating completely.  I've never smoked a cigar before.  Yeah.  Of course not.  I would say he smoked them like a fine cigar. 
[01:54:30]  That makes more sense.  This guy's an idiot.  Fires it in and the Penguins take a 1-0 lead.  Oh, get that dog off my lawnmower.  What the fuck does that mean?  Get that dog off my lawnmower.  We could argue the cigar thing, but what does that one mean?  Get that dog off my lawnmower. 
[01:55:00]  Wow.  Have you ever seen a dog on a lawnmower?  Never.  Shouldn't this be based on maybe something that is real?  But the way he said it was like, get that dog off my lawnmower.  Like, I've heard of get that dog off my lawn.  You know, people would yell, hey, get that dog off my lawnmower.  I don't know.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Michael, Michael, motorcycle. 
[01:55:30]  Boy, this guy is a hack.  Kirk McLean doesn't know whether to cry or wind his watch.  Malim doesn't know whether to cry or wind his watch.  All right.  And Forteador doesn't know whether to cry or wind his watch.  Anthony, when was the last time you actually wound a watch?  Wound the watch?  Um, I can't even recall.  I really don't wind a watch.  I, um, the watch is just...  Battery in there.  Uh, and, and by the way, that is a cop out. 
[01:56:00]  The saying is, doesn't know whether to shit or wind his watch.  Oh, really?  That is the saying.  I've never heard that saying before.  He doesn't know whether to shit or wind his watch.  Well, now we got video of a dog attacking a lawnmower.  Oh, wow.  Mm-hmm.  I'm getting a fast lane, Grandma.  The bingo game is ready to roll.  Jerry Slager with Gogger.  Cruising in front of the net.  He gets the lead.  Turns out.  Oh, by Gogger.  And getting the fast lane, Grandma.  The bingo game is ready to roll. 
[01:56:30]  I'm getting the fast lane, Grandma.  The bingo game is ready to roll.  Well, if it's a bingo game, it's coming up 68.  Boo!  Now, buy Sam a drink and get his dog 1-2.  And Kovala stepping out in front.  And a big save.  Rebound score.  And you can buy Sam a drink and get his dog 1-2. 
[01:57:00]  And the penguins score with 3.5 seconds to go in the period.  And you can buy Sam a drink and get his dog 1-2.  By the way, just to take you a little insight here, Sam is sitting where Danny usually sits  for a few moments.  And no matter what is being said, he is Googling pictures of it and shoving it up on the monitor  at an alarming pace. 
[01:57:30]  So we saw a dog on a lawnmower.  Now there's a dog drinking a soda.  We saw a grandma playing bingo.  Like, everything that happens, stupid Sam is popping a picture of him of it.  And now the Jager fires.  He gets his third of the night.  The hat trick for Jaromir Jager.  And here come the hats.  It's hat night at the Millen Arena.  Ladies and gentlemen, you got it.  Elvis has just left the building.  Why would Elvis leave the building for a hat trick? 
[01:58:00]  Maybe they put him over the top like the game's done.  Right, I hear you.  I hear you.  And there's that.  He sells and scores as he beats Theodore like a rented mule.  Joey Malatasa by Van Bietrook.  And he beats him like a rented mule.  Jaromir Jager beats Luongo like a rented mule.  All right.  If you rent a mule, apparently you beat it.  And there's a mule for rent. 
[01:58:30]  Sam found a picture of a mule with a for rent sign on it.  On its side.  Wow.  Sam is just amazing at Googling.  That indeed is a rented mule.  Wow.  Five seconds to go.  Loose around to the far corner.  Two seconds.  The Penguins are going to win the Stanley Cup, I believe.  Jelio shoots and blocks.  The Penguins have won the Stanley Cup.  Oh, Lord Stanley.  Lord Stanley, get me the brandy.  He worked on that one. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That was one he worked on.  Oh, yeah.  There's something a little different about his delivery that isn't quite.  Is that Lord Stanley, Sam?  Thank you.  Good old Lord Stanley.  Every guy looked like Jack Daniels back then.  Let's go to Bill in Pittsburgh.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hello.  Hey, listen, guys.  Thank you so much for exposing this douche who's been doing this for over 20 years. 
[01:59:30]  He's driven me crazy.  And, I mean, play-by-play, pretty good.  Those calls, douche, chills.  Yeah, the, uh, help me.  I think you're going to hear every sports announcer come up with this shit now.  I think this is the latest trend as far as calling games.  Uh, I like his energy, though, as far as announcing a hockey game.  Yeah, yeah.  God bless you.  Like, it doesn't sound bad.  No, I don't mind when he's calling a game. 
[02:00:00]  I've actually heard him before.  Uh, but, but coming up with that stuff, enough already.  Really.  Yeah, enough of the, uh, silly, the silliness.  Yeah.  All right.  And let's say hi to Jeremy in Alabama.  Very good news, Anthony.  He has the perfect jizz recipe.  Ooh.  Yes, Jeremy.  Hey.  Hey, uh, the recipe.  And, and don't ask me how I know this, but, uh, pina colada drink mix that you'd buy at  the grocery store mixed down with a little bit of water.  You can spray it on a girl's face all day and she's not going to get sick. 
[02:00:30]  What, what is it?  Pina colada mix?  Yeah, pina colada mix.  Yeah, it's like you use at F.H. Raleigh's there.  Plug, plug.  I'm trying to think if that even looks like, does that look like jizz?  Yeah.  I guess it could, because I think that's what, um, uh, Bear from Maryland is saying.  That's pretty much the same stuff.  Oh, really?  Pina colada mix is, um.  Wow, Bear's going to back you up, Jeremy.  Uh, Bear.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Brr.  I think what he's referring to is a product called Coco Lopez. 
[02:01:00]  It has, like, the same color, same consistency as a nice batch.  Yeah, I've seen, uh, people making that, uh, making, like, a pina colada and pouring that  shit in.  And it does, uh, have a jizz-like, uh, appearance.  You use the Lopez and pineapple juice, dump it in there, you got yourself a nice pina colada.  But it is some sticky, juicy, batch consistency.  Well, hold on.  I'm reading, this recipe for theatrical cum looks like real cum. 
[02:01:30]  It has no sugar, uh, so as to discourage yeast, and has natural, uh, taste so that you can  really get into the fantasy.  Because it contains, uh, raw egg white, you should make it fresh right before use and discard  the leftovers.  If you're concerned about using a raw egg, either don't swallow it or use pasteurized  egg whites, which can be purchased at most supermarkets.  However, fresh eggs give better consistency.  One cup water, two tablespoons cornstarch, one raw egg white, one tablespoon plain yogurt, 
[02:02:00]  and a pinch of salt.  Yes.  And that will give you, um, the perfect fake jizz.  We should have the boys have a fake jizz making contest.  Fake jizz bukkake contest.  Ugh.  We'll use Patty's face.  Again.  She hasn't been on the show in a while.  Thank you, Bear.  I don't like the taste of it.  Uh, let me go to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie.  Charlie. 
[02:02:30]  What's up, boys?  Hey, Charlie.  Uh, yeah, instead of beat him like a running mule, isn't it supposed to be beat him like  a redheaded stepchild?  Yeah, they both have been used over the years, I believe.  Yeah, he probably got in trouble for that one.  He probably used him once.  Yeah.  I hate to say it, but I'd rather hear the Yankee, the grease man do the Yankee calls.  He goes, belly to belly.  Why don't you do this?  I'm back to back.  And the belly to belly.  Snarling.  Later, boys.  Snarling's to you too, sir. 
[02:03:00]  God, we should have picked up on that.  Sounds a little bit like the grease man.  Yeah.  Waddle doodle.  Snarling and lead in that bet.  Uh, Anthony, time for some Mayor Menino audio.  Ah.  And let's not forget about the guy that slapped that kid in a mall.  I think it was.  We'll get into that story.  Yeah, I want to do that, but we've been teasing this Mayor Menino audio.  Yeah, Mayor Menino's up for the re-election, I guess, huh?  It's amazing.  We left Boston.  Boston.  I think 11 years ago, I think.  Yep.  And he was the mayor before we got there, and we did three years in Boston. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Uh, I guess he's been at it for 16 years, and...  16 fucking years as mayor of Boston.  Oh, is this good?  It's, eh.  Is it worth playing?  Ooh.  Just to get the point across.  All right.  Remember the, um, the PGA Championship call that guy came up with?  Said it was really douchey?  Oh, yeah.  When, uh, Tiger Woods, like, uh, choked to this, uh, Y.E. Yang, I think?  Y.E. Yang.  I think that's his name.  Yee Yang?  This is how it went down.  Here you go. 
[02:04:00]  This is it.  This is to change the game.  Parks all around the world.  Y.E. Yang.  Y.E. Yang.  Y.E. Yang has won the PGA Championship.  Y.E. Yes.  He goes, Y.E. Yes.  He was waiting to say that.  Oh, was he hoping that went in?  I think that's what it comes down to. 
[02:04:30]  When you know the announcer's been waiting to say the certain phrase, that's what drives  me nuts.  If it comes off the cuff.  Didn't just pop into his head.  Right, right, right, right.  Like, why do you, yes.  Holy shit.  No, he had that written down in front of him.  He said, all right, if he makes this putt, I'm just waiting.  Right.  Don't mind me.  What is that about?  I don't know.  What is, oh boy.  Oh my God, stop.  Oh boy.  He's going to rip off the guy's face.  What?  What?  What?  This is.  Why was he eating bugs out of his hair? 
[02:05:00]  No.  What?  No.  That's not what was happening?  No.  I don't think that's what was happening.  Are you sure?  Very funny.  I was a little confused there.  Yeah, me too.  I love how my funny stuff is visual.  That works great for the radio.  All right, Mayor Menino.  So he did a debate last night.  He's been the mayor for 16 years and we learned that he was able to somehow avoid debating  people on live TV.  Yeah.  And obviously it's because he sucks at speaking.  He can't speak.  He might be a good politician. 
[02:05:30]  I don't even really know.  It seems like Boston does okay.  It seems like Boston runs itself.  Right.  But Mayor Menino is up for re-election and he finally had a debate for the first time  on live TV with other candidates that sound so much like politicians.  Yeah.  Smooth talkers.  Yep.  They're very good at public speaking.  They know how to answer questions at a debate.  They know that political lingo and they have the nice voice. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  And then Menino is like they threw a retard in there just for the fun of it.  You want to start with Mayor Menino's opening statement?  Run on ideas and run on sentences.  He doesn't know how to wrap up an idea.  He's stumbling over words, mumbling, getting words wrong.  What's fun about Mayor Menino, you get to put the periods in for him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  See where the period would go.  Yeah.  All right.  Mr. McCray, thank you.  Mr. Menino, Boston better off or worse off? 
[02:06:30]  Thank you, John, for having this forum this evening.  And to the audience out there, thank you for being interested in a campaign about the future  of our city.  Boston today is a different city than it was four years ago.  When you think about the issue of development, we continue to improve our neighborhoods.  Neighborhoods of Boston today are stronger than ever before.  When you come to public education, we're making progress in Boston public schools every year.  When you think about crime, the lowest crime rate in 40 years right now in the city of Boston. 
[02:07:00]  That's what the city's all about.  Jobs.  We're in the green job era.  And how do we create more jobs for the future?  And on the green issue, let me tell you, this is about the future.  We've done a lot with green job training.  We continue to move fast and forward.  It comes to our city.  We stabilize the tax rate.  The last two years, the tax rate has been stable.  How do we get there?  Because good financial management of our city, and that's what we do every day, manage the  city well for the people of Boston, make sure the taxes and the rates of taxes are stable. 
[02:07:30]  Mr. Menino, thank you.  What the fuck was he covering there, by the way?  He sounds like, you ever hear or watch a sixth grader debate?  He was just trying to fill up as much time as he could with as much babble about everything.  Great jobs.  Folks, we're in the green job era.  It's the future.  And with that, green jobs, that's the future.  Future.  That's how a sixth grader would debate that. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  All right.  He's the worst.  Mayor Menino continues by arguing with his opponent about street flaggers.  What's a street flagger?  It's like they moved, you know, the traffic to the construction sites and stuff.  Yeah, you know.  They're using cops.  And so the debate was whether to use cops to do that or just hire people to just wave  the flags.  Ooh, that's a biggie up there, man.  Yep.  The police details.  There's a policeman on every construction site in the Boston area.  Yeah.  I forgot what that's based on, but I think it's based on the fact that somebody did their 
[02:08:30]  job horribly wrong, and I think they lost some lives.  So they said, nope, we're giving this detail to the cops up there.  Four hours to learn how to be a street flagger, a civilian flagger, to get their certification  in Massachusetts.  I'm for eliminating police details so that we can have policemen fighting crime in this  city.  Thank you.  Mr. Menino, one minute.  I'm in favor of police details because he's giving me 200 additional police officers in  the streets of our city.  I don't know what he said. 
[02:09:00]  He said he'll give him 200 unconditional police.  Well, I don't know what he said.  It's not a digital commission.  He said he'll give me 200 additional police officers in the streets of our city.  Now, just imagine having flaggers on Massachusetts Avenue as you're doing construction.  Who's going to get the cars towed?  Who's going to move the traffic?  But also, detailed officers help us fight crime.  Just look at Charlestown the other day.  Two officers on detail solved the bank robbery.  The other day, two officers on detail helped solve another crime. 
[02:09:30]  They work, and the cost is approximately the same as a flag man.  So the details, it's a lot of conversation about that.  But why do we protect the state police, and why do we have the Boston police?  We need police officers on Mass Avenue, Dodge S.  On side streets, we could go with a flag man.  One of the main thoroughfares in the city.  It's about moving traffic.  It's about fighting crime.  It's about more officers in the streets.  Thank you, Mr.  Mayor Menino, you mean to tell me that a police officer on a detail work, on detail work as a flag man, is the same amount of money as just some scrub waving a fucking flag? 
[02:10:00]  Stop it!  Wow.  Why are they homeboys for Mayor Menino?  Barfrostin loves him.  They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Mayor Menino says something about schools in this clip.  Something, but I'm not quite sure what it is. 
[02:10:30]  You, Mr. Menino, one minute.  I propose in-district charter schools.  What I want to do is take the underperforming schools.  Why?  Give the superintendent in the school committee the opportunity to move those underperforming schools up to a place of choice schools in our city.  We don't need more schools.  We need better schools.  In 2006, Boston was given the Broad Prize for the best urban school system in America.  And just recently, U.S. News and World Report, just eight of our high schools were nationally recognized by them. 
[02:11:00]  Do we have problems?  Yes, we do, because we take every child in.  But we're dealing with some of the issues.  The dropout rates decreased by 30% since I've been mayor of this city.  That's important.  Also, we put full kindergarten in Boston for four-year-olds.  We went from 3K to 8s to 28K to 8s.  That's what we're doing.  But charter schools, I was never against charter schools.  I was against the issue of financing charter schools, because they get more money for their students than I do for the Boston Public Schools.  That's my issue. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, charter schools?  What issue was your issue?  Child schools?  I think he was trying to say the word that we say.  Charter schools.  As charter.  Charter schools.  How does it come out child?  It sounded like China schools.  So, I don't know what he was saying.  How it isn't as bad, but still, I mean, if you're the mayor, you should speak a little better than that.  Well, did you follow what he was talking about?  No, exactly.  No, honestly, you try.  Yeah.  He runs on and on.  You don't know what he's talking about.  Well, let's go to the next one. 
[02:12:00]  Mayor Menino says business is growing in Boffiston.  Why are we continuing to lose private sector jobs and failing to create new ones, and how would you reverse that trend?  John, 1,200 jobs increase because we continue to improve the Boston Public Schools, the police department, and fire.  If you look at those number of those jobs, they go into public safety and education in our city.  We're increasing our job.  We just worked with one of the corporations to bring them to Boston. 
[02:12:30]  They're going from 700 jobs to 1,200 jobs.  We continue to invest in new economies down the water from the creative industries of our city.  We continue to do those things as we go through the difficulties of this recession that we're in.  But I just want to say, looking forward, how do we look forward is to look at the life sciences.  How do we continue to invest in life sciences?  How do we continue to look at what we're doing with the legal seafood development? 
[02:13:00]  How do we create all these things that continue to bring jobs to Boston?  You know, the Minister of Research Bureau only looks at small numbers.  We look at the big picture and how we create more people to come into our city, how we're helping businesses grow in Boston.  That's what I'm looking at.  Not bringing in new people.  Businesses grow in Boston.  Precision.  Thank you, Mr. Yous.  He ended with precision.  Precision.  And didn't he say bringing more people into Boston for jobs? 
[02:13:30]  And then he goes, we're not looking to bring new people into Boston.  He contradicted himself completely.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I think what he was getting at was there are new jobs in Boston because he opened a legal seafood restaurant.  Yeah.  And you don't brag about 1,200 jobs in a city like Boston.  In 16 years.  Yeah, in 16 years.  100 jobs a year, basically.  Great.  Fucking guy.  Mayor Menino responds to accusations of corruption. 
[02:14:00]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, this is something that's talked about up there in Boston.  I can't even say the word.  These guys will tell you that they've squeezed the budget to the minimum.  But just back on June 20th, a city hall worker, someone who worked at the BRA, James Rourke, gave the mayor a $200 campaign contribution.  Ten days later, the mayor sold Mr. Rourke a piece of city property assessed at $100,000.  All right.  You know what?  Whoa! 
[02:14:30]  You know what, though?  This guy's got to relax.  Why?  He gave the mayor $200, and the mayor turns around and gives him a property worth over $100,000 for $200?  Well, same guy.  If there's corruption, wouldn't you think that number would be a bit higher?  Maybe that's all you saw.  A piece of city property assessed at $100,000 for a mere $5,000.  This is the mayor's signature on the deed right here.  This is the type of corruption that's going on at City Hall right now under the auspices of our political figures here. 
[02:15:00]  We need to stop the giveaways that's going on here.  Okay.  That's a serious, specific charge made against you, Mr. Mayor.  I want you to take the first turn to rebut it.  Go ahead, sir.  John, Kevin, that's nonsense.  You know that.  John, Kevin.  John, Kevin.  Oh, how am I going to...  I don't know the other guy.  I don't even know his name, but he at least sounds like a politician.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  That's nonsense.  You know that.  And my record shows it.  Mr. Rook got a piece of butter a lot.  We have that program in City Boston.  Land next to a person's home.  We don't want to maintain that lot, so we sell it to the butter next door.  We went to our legal counsel.  We checked it out.  So, you know, your charges are out of balance.  Your charges are what?  Out of balance.  Out of balance.  There's like out of bounds, out of line, anything but out of... 
[02:16:00]  He couldn't pronounce Rourke.  It's his friend's last name.  That Rook.  We don't want to maintain that lot.  So, we sell it to the butter next door.  We went to our legal counsel.  We checked it out.  So, you know, your charges are out of balance.  Out of balance?  Out of balance.  Yeah.  Not out of bounds.  I think he was trying to say out of bounds.  Out of bounds.  Mr. Rook.  Mr. Rook.  Mr. Rook.  Rook.  Mayor Menino gets snippy about the city budget in this next book. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, boy.  Is this a good one?  Oh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, since January, the mayor has put $120 million into the bank.  All right.  Rebuttal.  That is not true, Kevin.  It's $100 million.  Here's the document right here.  One at a time, please.  This is capital funds we use to pay our bills in city government.  If you know how to do city budget, that money is used to pay our bills.  And the city government continues to grow our expenses, our union contracts, salaries, operation.  That's why we have the additional money.  Exactly. 
[02:17:00]  It grows and grows and grows, but we don't get better service.  Let me just tell you.  The city has been lowest.  We've had the highest bond rating of any of our city ever in the past.  Why?  Because we know how to manage our city well.  Also, we reduced the refinancing of our bonds.  We saved $30 million.  8.6 million was saved by overtime reductions.  Also, health insurance.  Here's the document right here.  We have more money in the bank than we ever had in history.  Kevin, we'll give you a lesson in budget management.  Kevin, because you don't understand it. 
[02:17:30]  I was fortunate.  I like you a lot.  But you don't understand budget management.  All right, let's let the other...  You don't understand budget management.  This is the mayor trying to talk.  He's on the run in this debate.  Oh, boy, that one Kevin guy is really bashing him.  He's got paperwork.  He's got signatures.  He's got fucking figures.  Mr. Mayor, with all due respect, you have too much power.  Your office has too much power.  And unless we address that, none of the things that we've talked about on this debate are going to be solved as challenges that we're going to face in the 21st century. 
[02:18:00]  Go ahead.  Rebut him.  Sam, this is just me.  It's the people who work for me.  Never say what happens to the government.  I have a cabinet.  Over half of those individuals, over half of them, didn't work for me in the campaign.  Most of my department heads did not work for me in the campaign.  This is not about patrons.  It's about hiring the best people to do the job.  Carol Johnson, Ed Davis, Barbara Faria.  That's what we continue to do is hire people who are experts in that field to help me do the job because mayors can't do it alone. 
[02:18:30]  You need a good staff.  Also, you have to have neighborhood folks who call on every day to help me make decisions about how you move the city forward over the next several years.  He's not rebutting the charges.  He's charging that the mayor has too much power.  I mean, he talks about his staff.  Someone on it writes, super antenna, S-U-P-E-R-I-N-T-E-N-N-A, super antenna, school, car, me.  And then writes, what the fuck was that? 
[02:19:00]  Super antenna, school, car, me.  There you go.  Where's your odorous urungus comes from?  Wow.  Mayor Manila.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm stunned every time he speaks.  It's amazing.  I think if you become a politician, you really need to know how to speak.  Yeah.  In public.  Right?  Unbelievable. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, you should be able to.  Part of it is being a public speaker.  Your job is to, you know, run the city, but then you have to be able to communicate what  you're doing and what you've done to those people.  How do you do that when he can't even speak?  You could be the head of John Hancock.  You could be the publisher of the Globe.  And I'll tell you when you're mayor of the city of Boston, you could be mayor of Boston.  They all come from the same place. 
[02:20:00]  What?  What?  When you're trying to plot your summer, find and look for the oversized mappings, there'll  be a different attraction across our city.  Okay.  I defy you.  I defy you.  Go try to find a mappin.  To tell me what the fuck he was just talking about.  If you're in Boston right now, please try to find a mappin.  Give me a mappin.  And take a picture of that.  A mappin?  I've never seen a mappin before.  What do they eat?  What do mappins eat? 
[02:20:30]  These cost increases can get the way of having summer fun.  But only we let it.  What?  There's a mappin.  Is that a mappin?  Sam found some mappins.  What's a mappin?  Mappin Spine Jewelers.  Mappin Spine Jewelers.  That's not what it is.  Mappin?  Mappin.  Of course, some of the classics for you.  Tomorrow's the day of celebration, our city.  Come downtown.  Enjoy yourself.  Give the Celtics the rousing cheer they deserve. 
[02:21:00]  A rousing season in the city of Austin.  A rousing season.  You know what?  And it won't even be close, by the way.  He will be re-elected.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No one comes close to beating this guy.  I don't get it.  I'm really delighted to have you host in our first ever joint ceremony of celebrate 2008  Boston Educators and Service Excellence Award winners. 
[02:21:30]  You're Jehosen.  What's you, Jehosen?  I don't get it.  He asked the number of individual homeless or down.  Just two more for today.  I was on Berkeley Street one day.  Who was on the street begging?  The guy you played cards with.  Because he taught me too into alcoholism.  And finally.  But also, you know, doing resumes. 
[02:22:00]  You know, the other thing I was going to teach you on Friday.  I've got your points.  So, you know, I was you.  But who was you to be there?  Who was you to be there?  Well, who was you to be there?  We'll leave it there.  We could go all morning with this.  There's literally another 30 clips.  He is a wreck.  And he'll be mayor again.  Let me say hi to Doug in Boston.  Doug.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  All right.  He is an ass and he cannot speak. 
[02:22:30]  But a map in is a little blown up corner down of, if you ever look at a state map and they  have the city blow ups down in the corner with all the details of it.  Sure.  That is a map in.  It's two words.  He's just a fucking mumbling idiot.  Mapping.  Oh, so you can't even really defend him.  Did he even mean that?  Yeah.  It's a map in.  It is an actual thing.  Okay.  Thank you, sir.  He just can't talk.  Wow.  Let me go to Michael in Virginia. 
[02:23:00]  Michael.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, when he holds a press conference, does someone next to him have an applause sign to  let people know what's going on?  Yeah.  Just, he's astoundingly.  He's a bumbling idiot.  Absolutely.  You just can't hear.  But he'll be the mayor again.  Chris, Long Island.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I heard if you asked me about the three branches of the government.  And he can tell you the House, the Senate, and legal seafood. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Legal seafood.  And Andy in Cleveland.  Andy.  Hey, as bad as Menino is, I don't know if I want to trade him for what we got in Cleveland.  We got Frank Jackson.  He's the anti-Obama.  He looks white, but sounds like an ignorant black man.  Oh, we might.  Can we get some of that?  Maybe we can find some money for that guy.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  And he's up for re-election.  All right.  Yeah, we'll look into that.  I appreciate it.  Let's go to John in Salem, Massachusetts.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, John. 
[02:24:00]  Offering some translation for Mr. Menino.  Yeah.  The summer fun after the Mappins.  Yeah.  He just wanted to have everyone go to the beach and have some summer fun with a Mappin.  It's a small Japanese child.  I don't know if you've seen the videos online.  I don't know what he's saying either, but that's funny, go to the beach with a Mappin.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're welcome, guys.  All right.  Anthony, you got the story of the day, you think? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, this one's good.  You know, this is something.  This is one of those Chris Rock things.  You understand?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's also something that it's a sign of the times.  I think we all have been in this position and wanted to do exactly what this guy did.  Yeah.  But it's like the perv switch.  We kind of hold back at the last second, right?  You hold back.  You bite your tongue and you just fucking, you know, go about your business.  This guy was busted for slapping a stranger's child as the child cried in a Walmart. 
[02:25:00]  It's a man in Georgia.  He's Roger Stevens, 61 years old.  He was shopping Monday morning at a Walmart in Stone Mountain when he crossed paths with  Sonia Matthews and her little two-year-old daughter, Paige.  The child was crying, which apparently greatly perturbed Matthews.  And I quote, he said, if you don't shut that baby up, I will shut her up for you. 
[02:25:30]  Stevens warned Matthews.  According to the Gwinnett County Police Department report, moments later, Stevens acted on the  threat, slapping little two-year-old Paige across the face.  Approximately four or five times.  Not even one little smack.  Like, whack, whack, whack, whack.  He went to town.  Yeah.  Went to town.  Though the child started crying and screaming after being struck, Stevens told Matthews, 
[02:26:00]  see, I told you I'd shut her up.  Wow.  After police summoned, Stevens told the cop that the child was crying and he just slapped  her.  And according to the report, Stevens was arrested for felony cruelty to children and booked into  the Gwinnett County Detention Center, where he's going to be held without bond.  Little Paige sustained slight redness to the face, but was otherwise unharmed. 
[02:26:30]  And his mugshot is classic.  Yeah.  He looks like he's the type of person that would slap someone's kid.  Yeah.  He's every old guy that shakes his fist on the lawn.  How are you, kids?  Why are you?  But years ago, it was pretty much acceptable to yell at and give like a whack to kids that  weren't even your own.  Just in a store.  If they were doing something they weren't supposed to do.  I don't fucking know.  I never saw that. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, fuck.  In your own house, maybe, if you had someone else's kids there.  No, no, no.  I never saw it in public.  Like.  That was acceptable.  Not really for crying or anything, but let's, let me give you this little scenario.  Okay.  If you're in a store, a supermarket.  What kind?  I don't know.  Whole Foods.  Let's go with the key food or Wallbaums.  Okay.  Or if you're in California, a Vons.  A Vons.  Nice.  Or what about down south?  What about a Wegmans?  If you're in a Winn-Dixie.  Wegmans? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  If you're in one of those.  If you're in a Bohack.  What are some of those other supermarkets?  King Cullen.  Starving Shop.  Seatown.  Seatown.  Shaws.  Shop Run.  That never gets old.  That never gets old.  All right.  So you're.  Yeah.  You were in one of these supermarkets.  You're in one of these supermarkets.  And a child is. 
[02:28:00]  But it's back, you know, in the 60s or something.  And a small child is in the white section of the store.  And he is a little colored child.  I'm teasing, of course.  If it's in the 60s.  Jesus.  And a child is climbing up on the shelf or something.  Climbing up on the shelves.  And the mother isn't looking.  And somebody grabs the kid, pulls him down, and then gives him a whack on the ass and goes,  Don't you climb up there.  And then the parent would turn around and go, Your child was crawling up.  And then the parent would come over, smack the kid again, and go, Don't you climb up there. 
[02:28:30]  That happened to you?  No.  But I've seen things like that as a kid.  No, no, it didn't.  I did leave once.  My mother thought I was abducted.  Yeah.  I was.  This is my first memory as a human being, by the way.  My first memory as a human being, I think I was three years old.  And it was being in a supermarket in Flushing, Queens.  I was a little tyke.  And I wanted a, one of those little balsa wood airplanes that you put together that they 
[02:29:00]  would sell in the supermarket, you know, the little rubber band propeller.  And my mother finally was like, Okay.  So she gets it and gives it to me to hold on to until we get to the checkout.  Well, I didn't want to wait.  So little Anthony just walked, moseyed away from his mom, walked out of the store and started  walking to where I thought was home.  Holy shit.  Because I wanted to play with my airplane. 
[02:29:30]  That was the era of the pedo too.  I don't know.  No one got me.  They've calmed down that whole pedo thing for the most part.  But when you were young, those vans were just circling.  Oh, just waiting.  Waiting for someone like you.  Waiting for a little, little tussleable headed kid like me.  You could have been living in a tent for 18 years.  I know.  Getting ass raped or something.  So, yeah, the next thing I remember is just walking down the street.  And my mother, and I guess the manager of the supermarket, came running behind me. 
[02:30:00]  And my mother was all like upset.  What are you doing?  You don't ever walk away from me.  And then was crying as she's hitting you.  Yeah, and then she's like smacking me.  But she's, you know, having a little, like, I was going to play with my airplane.  I'm crying, of course.  And now you're scared shitless because you saw her scared shitless.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  What?  Most kids cry because they see the expression on the adult's face.  You know that, right?  Well, unless you really punch him.  Well, the kid falls down.  You see it all the time on a sidewalk or something. 
[02:30:30]  The kid gets up, looks around.  Yeah, yeah.  They always look around.  And then they see their mom with that horrific look on their face like, oh, my God.  And that's when most kids start crying.  Yeah.  So you just got to look at them and smile no matter how badly they're bleeding.  If the parents had a better poker face, these kids wouldn't cry.  Poker face.  They wouldn't cry as much.  And as far as this story goes, there should be a law.  There should be a time limit where if a kid is crying in public, that kid is on the clock. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, boy.  And if the mother or the father doesn't do anything to at least try to shut the kid up,  then you should have every right to shut the kid up.  I don't think the smacking worked.  Because in most cases, parents go, yeah, it's a child.  What am I supposed to do?  Yeah.  Well, you're supposed to at least try.  I think that's all we want.  We're at a restaurant.  We're on a flight.  All we want, really, is for you to at least try.  It's frustrating.  It drives you nuts that a kid's crying.  But what drives me even more nuts is with the parents sitting by and not doing anything. 
[02:31:30]  Because they just assume, well, this is what kids do.  It's like I hear it all day, so it doesn't bother me.  I can tune it out.  But if you don't try to shut up your own kid, then I think we should have every right to shut your kid up for you.  Or just give it whatever the fuck it wants.  Like, after a while, you've passed the point.  If it's crying because it wants something.  Were you on the flight?  Oh, with the candy?  The candy?  Yeah.  And the mother?  Yeah.  That was you, right?  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  We haven't told that story in a while, but we were flying.  Lucky enough to be in first class.  It was all nice.  Mother with a couple kids.  And the kid starts crying because all the kid wants is this candy that the mom actually has in her hand.  Yeah.  And she decided at that moment she needed to teach the kid a lesson at 35,000 fucking feet.  No lesson teaching.  In the middle of a five and a half hour flight.  Yeah.  That it wasn't, that she's going to teach the kid a lesson and not give him the candy.  You give the kid whatever he wants.  You're like, just give him the fucking candy. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Teach him the lesson when this plane lands.  Exactly.  Don't fucking start teaching a kid that he can't have candy.  How long did the kid cry for?  Teach him a little lesson.  And don't pump it up for the radio.  I can't remember.  At least an hour.  Yeah.  It was at least an hour.  I put the headphones on and...  The kid cried himself out.  Tuned out.  And then finally it was over.  But, you know, it could have ended a lot sooner if the woman just gave the damn candy over.  Some parents are very fucking selfish and thoughtless.  Yeah, I agree. 
[02:33:00]  They don't think about anyone else but them and their stupid fucking offspring.  Mm-hmm.  Like enough already.  All right.  Are we ready for the guar guy?  I think so.  Are we ready for odorous?  For odorous?  They've been pushing odorous on us for weeks.  Yeah.  And nothing against odorous.  I just don't know much about them.  I don't either.  I know, I've seen guar over the years.  Just seen them.  Mm-hmm.  I've never gone to a show or nothing.  No, no.  They kind of have something going on.  And I think he's the last original member, right? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Odorous?  Apparently so.  And I guess he knows how to talk.  And he's going to be on Red Eye with you tonight.  Yes.  So you guys better get along here today.  Yeah, we'll be fine.  All right.  We're going to get ready for odorous.  Yerungus?  Did he bring his fake penis thing with the jizz?  That I'm not sure about.  I did see him pretty much nude in Steve's office.  Oh.  Well, that makes sense.  What does he look like without the costume?  Because he's a little scary when he's all dressed up. 
[02:34:00]  I just walked by very briefly and just saw what looked like a tall man wearing like a black speedo thing.  Getting collated by a large man with a mustache?  You know, and I didn't really feel like standing there and like looking in to get a good look at this pretty much nude man.  So I just kept on walking.  Yeah.  Oh, Steve.  Steve, what do we know on Odorous?  Is he psyched?  Yeah.  He's really excited.  Apparently, he did, Odorous did Red Eye last night and apparently got into it with Adam Carolla.  Oh, he did it last night?  Yeah, he did it last night.  I thought he was doing it tonight.  The bio said tonight. 
[02:34:30]  He got into it with Adam?  He got into it with Carolla, who was apparently too cool for the room.  I don't really...  Adam's always too cool for the fucking room.  He's got to lighten up.  We'll have to ask him what that was about.  Yeah.  He really has to lighten up.  About?  And they just went at it about what?  They went at it about, I guess...  Yeah, I guess...  That's him without his costume?  He's just some dude.  Are you kidding me?  That's so funny.  That's Dave.  He looks like a computer tech.  That's him?  Well, his father was a computer, I believe. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, really?  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  The bio said.  I forgot.  That's him without his costume?  Yeah.  He's a billion years old.  Oh, now this is going to be easy.  Yeah.  He should have never let us seen him without the costume on.  Well, he's made...  There's videos of Dave on YouTube.  You're calling him Dave now?  Well, that's...  It's just Dave.  I'm sorry.  It's no big mystery.  His real name is Dave Brockie.  And there's videos of him making the odorous costumes.  But once he's odorous, he's odorous.  And I said, so Dave, are you going to break character? 
[02:35:30]  He goes, well, they can try.  I was like, all right.  Did he bring his schween?  Oh, yeah.  He's got it on.  Is it loaded?  I don't...  I can't tell.  I don't really know.  It's very large and bulky.  So it may be.  You mean his real dick or the mechanism?  The mechanism.  What was it?  Would you take a shot of jizz from the fake apparatus?  I don't know.  I don't really...  I don't know.  A lot of people would consider it an honor.  Yeah.  I know.  I'm not one of those people, though.  Oh, okay. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, that's him without his...  All right.  That's so funny.  Him without his makeup.  That's weird.  That's Dave.  But we're going to meet odorous.  It looks like Laszlo a little bit in that shot.  Okay.  We'll take a break and we'll get odorous in here, all right?  Rightio.  Coop.  Coopie and Anthony.  Hey.  Of course.  You know that.  Yay.  They ran enough sweepers telling you that. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Walking down the hall is odorous.  Is he going to be...  From war.  I try to talk to him...  Oh, my God.  I try to talk to him as Dave because we saw him without the costume on.  There's a picture that we took.  Yeah.  And I go, hey, could you just talk to me as Dave for a second because I've never met  you?  He goes, yeah.  But then he never talked to me as Dave.  This is just silly.  Look, this is just silly.  Why is it silly?  His big dick thing. 
[02:37:00]  Odorous is walking down the hall from war.  Look what's flopping, Anthony.  I see it.  His schween.  Schween.  Yes.  Wow.  It takes him a long time to walk with that big schween swinging from side to side.  That's what it is.  The big area.  Here's Odorous making his appearance on the Opie and Anthony show for the first time.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Holy shit.  This isn't Jeopardy.  They told me I was going to be on Wheel of Fucking Fortune tonight. 
[02:37:30]  No, no.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Here we go.  Wow.  Taking a load off.  Wow.  You guys mind if I masturbate?  No.  Feel free.  I don't want to blow up any equipment in here.  You can do whatever you want.  We got quarter on this.  Yeah.  Oh, actually, I was watching this.  Look at that little bitch.  Yes, there's a little midget on Maury.  That little fat black bitch.  Look at that.  Go, go.  We were on that show.  Oh, no.  Maury, yeah.  The Springer.  Jerry Springer. 
[02:38:00]  Jerry Springer.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, what's up?  There is.  What took you guys so long to have me on the show?  I don't know.  We were stupid.  The time is right.  The time is right now.  Everything happens for a reason.  Yeah.  And there's a reason why it took a while to get on this show.  We don't know what that reason is.  All we know is that I'm here now.  Undoubtedly, I am here now.  You cannot deny that.  No, you are here now.  I'm really digging the abs.  Yeah.  Six-pack abs.  I'm ripped. 
[02:38:30]  I'm fucking ripped.  You must go to the gym every day.  Oh, God.  I'm just like, you know, never, actually.  I don't work out.  That's bad for you.  No, no.  What is your schween made of?  It looks like...  You know, this is made out of...  It looks like a pig or something.  It's the cuttlefish of Cthulhu.  The cuttlefish, yeah.  Oh, yeah, the cuttlefish of what?  Of Cthulhu.  Yeah.  See, in outer space, it's a little different.  Like, a lot of people are like, hey, odorous, how come you walk around with your dick hanging  out?  And I'm like, first of all, that is not a dick.  And second of all, it's Mr. Odorous to you, punk.  And third of all, in outer space, it is considered a crime to not walk around with your dick 
[02:39:00]  hanging out, okay?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you have to have it hanging out.  Or you go to jail.  I often will put a shoe on the end of it and use it for a third leg.  It's very big, yeah.  It is big.  This is kind of the smaller version of it.  It's not fully engorged.  Actually, I haven't had a hard-on in about 500,000 years.  You know, I'm still waking up.  I'm still kind of de-thought.  Oh, I'm starting to touch myself.  It's starting to fucking feel pretty good. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Watch it.  Oh, yeah.  I like it.  Are we on the radio?  Yeah, believe it or not.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Well, it's great to be here.  Hey, all you Gward fans out there.  You were on Red Eye, I believe, last night.  Yes, I've been completely seduced by the Fox corporate entity.  I am their new interplanetary correspondent, if you will.  I saw that.  They actually put the graphic on the bottom.  Yeah, I saw it.  Actually, I was looking at the website and, you know, on the CompuWeb or the intro, whatever 
[02:40:00]  the hell that thing is.  There was my face right next to Bill O'Reilly's.  Yeah.  And I was pretty excited.  Wouldn't expect to see that.  And then after the show, he visited me in my dressing room and we had oral sex.  And then I said, oh, I might have just lost my job on Fox.  Hey, Odorous.  Yeah, yeah.  Why are you drinking coffee out of a straw?  It takes away from your whole luck.  I mean, it just...  It takes away from the whole quality, don't you think? 
[02:40:30]  That's what I'm all about, though.  Just disappointment.  I'm just...  Yes, Kenny.  Yes, Odorous is drinking coffee.  Hey, Odorous, we have a guy, E-Rock, who wants to be sprayed in the face by that piglet thing.  I don't know.  It takes a little while for me to get the load going.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I mean, I could probably...  If we got an intern, maybe, you can start working it.  You want to...  Well...  We can maybe work in the gherkin and get a couple jerks in or...  Would Evan do that for us? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Can we get Connie Chung in here to, like, maybe suck on it?  Connie Chung?  You're kind of putting me on the spot here, you know.  I don't know if I'm really...  I just blew a huge load downstairs.  Oh, God.  Anyway.  Jerking it off.  It's fantastic.  I love how he's got the paint on it.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Oh, hey.  Well, anyway.  He's got a Metallica t-shirt on.  Is that all right?  What?  Yeah.  Would you suck me off?  I mean, I'll give a shot.  Try to jerk on it here for a sec. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Touch it.  Oh.  Whoa.  Hold on.  I'll think about my mom.  All right.  Evan is now touching on his...  This is not working.  You're not doing...  Get out of here.  You made me sick.  You didn't like that.  What is it?  He's not pleasuring me like he should, like Connie Chung would.  Well, how about E-Rock?  I'll let anyone get here and suck my dick.  E-Rock, this guy's a giant fan.  I'll get on.  This is Graham, our new intern, and he's stroking the... 
[02:42:00]  A piglet shween hanging from over us.  It's not working.  We need more interns in here.  Come on, get over here.  Goddamn, get a fire hose on it and kind of try to cut off the...  They're all working, these shween now.  Can't tickle the balls.  Oh, he's grabbing...  He's grabbing the balls now.  Oh, I have shit myself.  That's where we got to go now.  We're starting to get something happening.  Giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity, giggity.  Oh, just stop.  It's a failure.  It ain't happening. 
[02:42:30]  What is going on?  I thought they left the Velveteen touch of a dandy fuck.  Hey, E-Rock, why don't you give it a try?  How many people can...  No, E-Rock will...  Oh, I'm not good at this.  Just maybe kick it.  Give it a kick.  Kick it.  Kick it.  Go ahead.  Oh, shit, E-Rock.  Jesus, E-Rock, you're a little angry, aren't you?  Guys, I mean, come on.  Can we talk about something else except my fucking cock?  Yeah, if it wasn't so, like, right out there...  Well, look, I'll tell you...  All right, he's hiding his cock. 
[02:43:00]  How long have you been with Gwar?  I am the original.  Yeah.  The prototypical.  The one who has been there.  I mean, we have actually been together as a rock group band for over 25 million years.  But you see, we only were dethawed recently.  I don't know if you're up with your Gwar lore, but we were trapped in Antarctica in the frozen  ice, so the story goes.  Sleazy P. Martini, our manager, was on the run from the IRS.  He was shot down over Antarctica. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  We stumbled into our tomb at the precise moment that the ozone had burned a layer hole through  the ozone layer because all those poofy hairspray bands like Brittany Fox were using too much  of that stuff on their big poofy rock and roll wigs.  And also, Brent Michaels is bald.  I was so glad when he got hit with that piece of scenery.  I thought that was fucking hilarious.  But anyway, what was I talking about?  Oh, yeah.  And then we woke up and Sleazy was like, what a great band. 
[02:44:00]  What's the name of your band?  And I looked back at him and I said, and he's like, that's not going to fit on a T-shirt.  I was like, can we go with Gwar?  Yeah.  And it's been 25 years of rock and roll.  I was trying to think of the right word for it that wouldn't be too self-insulting.  Devastation, mayhem, chaos, carnage.  These are all things that apply to Gwar.  I was just asking that because I was wondering if ever there was a time where you could actually  trace your abs when you did that. 
[02:44:30]  No, absolutely not.  I'm completely out of shape.  It's against my religion to exercise.  What happened to Adam Carolla last night?  Well, I mean, I was just funnier than he was.  And I don't think he liked it.  Was he being an asshole?  I really don't.  I mean, he came on the show.  The first thing he did to get me mad at him.  Not mad so much.  Because, like, I, you know, being an intergalactic celebrity, you know, I've seen all this stuff  before.  You know, I've partied with the Pope.  You know, I've licked OJ's poop shoot.  I've done coke all over the place. 
[02:45:00]  But, you know, Adam Carolla, I actually had a little bit of respect for him because of  the man show.  I thought, you know, that was pretty good with the chicks with the tits jumping up and  down on the trampoline.  Sure.  So what does he do?  He comes in there.  The first thing he says is, yeah, I'm more of a Slipknot fan.  Like, dude, Slipknot.  Slipknot, yeah, they got a great drummer.  They're an awesome band.  But it's just a bunch of dudes dressed up in monster costumes.  You know, like Lordy or, you know, whatever.  It's like, with Gwai, you're getting a real thing.  Right, right.  Really something.  I don't know what it is, but it's real. 
[02:45:30]  That pissed you off.  Well, it didn't really piss me off.  But, you know, I was kind of, you know, I just said something about, like, they were  talking about the U.S. Open.  And I decided to go for it.  I made a comment about couldn't get past the fuzzy balls.  And, you know, right then he's like, this dude is funnier than I am.  He accepted it.  And then he started talking about other stuff.  And, you know, they had him in Hollywood.  Like, at one point during the conversation when I figured out the screen on the wall was  actually a screen on the wall. 
[02:46:00]  I actually thought he was in a little box for a while.  But then he was like, I was trying to, like, establish rapport with him.  And he just did this.  He was sitting in front of a picture of the Hollywood sign.  And he just did this, like, I'm from Hollywood or something.  Yeah, point like, hey, look where I am.  It's like, ooh, yeah, I'm from Antarctica, okay, Adam?  I don't know.  I don't know what's up with him.  And we didn't really, it's not like we, you know, got into it with switchblades in the  alley.  But, uh.  No, Steve was always, yeah.  I was just, you know, I was just funnier than you, Adam. 
[02:46:30]  I was funnier than you.  And when I made the comment about Blanche having a stroke, everybody lost it in there.  Now, what's your, uh, what's your political views?  I hear you.  Politicians crucified.  Uh, we will draw up the contracts of laws for the new world on their skinned butt flesh.  Yeah, the only reason we have politicians in outer space is so we can crucify them.  Oh, interesting, uh, concept. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, I mean, they're pretty useless, aren't they?  I mean, it's pretty funny, too.  You're a little more left or right leaning.  You know, a lot of people try to get me, like, Odorous, what's your political view?  Are you left ring?  Are you right wing?  Do you even have a wing?  Is it a chicken wing?  You know, I would have to say, as much as I'm a liberal and a progressive and a creative  thinker, the, uh, the right wing embraces concepts I'm more familiar with, like, like  war and disease.  Uh, they didn't do anything for AIDS, really.  Uh, they started two wars, uh, that are just going nowhere. 
[02:47:30]  Uh, I guess we're running out of Iraq right now.  We're trying to fight these guys in, uh, I mean, have you seen, like, the way spiders  look over there?  They're huge.  Those things that live on the camel scrotums.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, how are we going to beat these people?  These, these things are, like, they live in the Taliban's genitals or something like  that.  It's like, there's no way we're going to win.  But anyway, uh, yeah, politicians, they suck.  I mean, just elect Odorous.  Actually, my manager, Sleazy P. Martini, uh, he is quite the, uh, international, uh, political 
[02:48:00]  figure.  He's kind of the man behind the scenes, pulling the strings and controlling the porno and the  crack industries, which is good for me, because I love porno and crack, and, uh, I love the  hell out of them, really.  What do you, what do you do when you're not, uh, performing?  Uh, lay around in a drug-induced stupor, pretty much.  Yeah.  I drink a lot.  A lot.  You have to drink a lot to be in this band.  Yeah, apparently, well, I, I just mean, like, you know, when, when you're not in the band,  you're just, mellowing, you golf?  I golf, yeah.  It's, you know, a lot of people are like, Odorous golfs, you know, but I do use Fuzzy 
[02:48:30]  Zeller's decapitated head as a ball, so.  How did he get managed to save his career, anyway, after he made that horrible remark about  Tiger, like, planting a buffet with chicken and watermelon and whatever else those people  eat?  How come he got away with that, but Jimmy the Greek got busted for saying, look at that  monkey run?  I mean, come on.  There's a double standard here.  How come Michael Richards gets to come back and do the new Seinfeld when he said that stuff 
[02:49:00]  about sticking a fork up that dude's butt?  I mean, what, you know?  Come on.  I think, yeah, but, you know, in the, in the, in the Seinfeld context, I guess it's,  uh, fine.  Well, I think it kind of adds more to Kramer's character to find out that he's a racist and  a homophobe, you know?  It's like, yeah, I'm kooky, I'm wacky, I hate gay people.  Odorous from GWAR.  He's dripping coffee on his, uh, on his coddle fish.  I was freaking up at, like, five in the morning, still, like, babbling insanely after my triumphant 
[02:49:30]  red-eye appearance, and, like, I've been going non-stop ever since.  Yeah, this, this coffee's pretty good.  Did you look in the mirror and just laugh your ass off when you first put that on?  Well, you know, I look in the mirror and basically, I see perfection.  I see everything that I want to be, and then I paint my six-pack abs on.  I just, I just, I just thought that was real before, so I tried to paint a bigger penis  on me, but no real need for that. 
[02:50:00]  Well, that's, uh, that's good.  You never tripped over those, uh, balls, did you?  Oh, no, many times.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, these are the brain balls.  Yeah, there's a lot going on down there.  There's brains.  People have accused me of thinking with my penis.  So you got the brain.  On occasion.  The balls.  Yeah, see, it's like, I had to have my brain removed from my skull, because it was too  obvious a target, even though my, my, my, I had a skull surgery to remove a tiny piece  of brain that was still stuck up there.  It's like, basically, I figure if they can't get at my brain, then they can't kill me. 
[02:50:30]  Not that it's a really important organ anyway, but I decided I would get them closer to my  penis and just kind of keep the operation going a little bit better.  In outer space, a lot of people actually have their faces right here, so they can eat their  own shit.  I'm serious.  Let it be known, he just points to his balls.  A face is a taint in outer space.  I do miss outer space.  Hey, what do you think of what's going on in music these days?  Well, it's crap, isn't it?  I mean, you know, I'm so sick of hearing these bands, especially in metal circles, that are 
[02:51:00]  just rehashed, you know, Slayer riffs, basically.  I mean, I think when Dime, bless his heart, when that idiot in Columbus blew his head off,  you know, that was a really sad day.  I think, right, that day, I think I saw just how screwed up and fucked up the music industry  really is, because the very next day, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio,  was having a big induction ceremony.  You know, and if they had any respect or they knew anything about modern music, they would 
[02:51:30]  have canceled the goddamn thing and shown Dime the respect and love that he deserved.  He was one of the most influential, awesome guitar players since freaking Jimi Hendrix.  But when he died, it just really seemed to cause an incredible rash of uncreativity and  just really shitty, bad, overly compressed.  I mean, bands like Nickelback.  I mean, I know there's always been a lot of crappy music out there, but it's just like  more so than ever.  But one thing I can say about all the shit music out there is that it certainly makes us 
[02:52:00]  look better.  That's for sure.  And another thing I can't stand are these self-appointed divas, these useless, my dad  works for the studio, you know, surgically augmented, fake-tittied, no-talent bitches  who, like, put out one song with them caterwauling about how much their fucking pussy hurts, and  next thing you know, they've got this big, I'm a diva, I'm a diva, I'm a diva my ass. 
[02:52:30]  I would like nothing better than to see a wild pig chowing down on Christine Aguilera's  diseased twat.  That's what I think about music.  It sucks.  There are some good bands out there, and we will be going out with Lamb of God, Job  for a Cowboy, and Red Court on a gigantic tour coming up this fall to pump our new album,  Lost in Space, which is undoubtedly the greatest choir album that we have made since the last  choir album that we made.  Right, of course.  Now, what happened to the rest of the guys in the band? 
[02:53:00]  Like, why are you the last remaining?  I get, you know, basically, they kind of freeze up like a deer in the headlights when they get  on TV and stuff.  They're still a little bit enamored of show business, and I'm just, you might have noticed,  but I have this thing called diarrhea of the mouth, and actually, diarrhea will start coming  out of my mouth soon.  That's why I have toilet paper installed behind my teeth, so it's like, it's like kind of shitting  and wiping at the same time.  Hopefully, that won't happen today.  But what happened to them?  What happened to the other guys, like the original members? 
[02:53:30]  Oh, they die.  They die, or they're, you know, they have drug overdoses.  They're torn apart by dinosaurs, or even like in the case of Joey Slutman, one of our original  singers, they go insane.  Yeah.  They run off down the street, hurling pieces of armor over their shoulder, only to be run  over by a bus.  You know, basically, now that we've solidified Odorous, Beefcake, Ballsack, Flattus, and  Jismac, and of course, the slaves of GWAR, combining to make an entertainment juggernaut of Goliath 
[02:54:00]  proportion, and, you know, we're here to get rid of all the crap, play some fucking heavy  metal, chop off some world leaders' heads, core out Lindsay Lohan's disease twat.  And, you know, that's how we roll.  That's what you do.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  You, uh...  That looks very inconvenient to be on stage with.  Oh, no, I mean, this is not a fashion statement. 
[02:54:30]  This is protection.  You know, like, I do shows, and the next thing I know, Sawborg Destructo is descended from  the heavens, flown in through the roof, and is trying to saw my scrotum off, you know?  Right, yes.  Rod Stewart never had to deal with that kind of stuff.  No, no, no, no, he didn't.  Granted, he might have had to deal with having 12 gallons of semen pumped out of his stomach.  Yes, we did hear that.  You know, that might have been my semen, actually.  But, you know, he never had, like, Gorgor chewing on his head, you know?  That's the...  A lot of people are like, oh, GWAR, it's just a big act. 
[02:55:00]  All you do is play these stupid fucking songs and dress up like monsters from outer space.  I'm like, yeah, and?  But I will put my band up against any of them.  I defy Cary King from Slayer to play a ripping solo while there is a dinosaur chewing on his penis.  Yes, it's kind of...  It would be kind of rough.  It is.  I mean, you know, so I dress like this to protect myself from my various enemies, but you will  notice, yes, my dick is hanging out.  It's against the law on my home world to ever cover my phallus. 
[02:55:30]  Well, why would you want to?  I know, it's got to breathe.  I've got to, like, slough off the old skin.  It's kind of like a rattlesnake, you know?  Yeah, it's quite disgusting.  What about your audience over the years?  Any changes there?  Yeah, it's really, really interesting.  GWAR started pretty much the first couple of years of GWAR.  We were still thawing out.  The music was fairly primitive.  So we kind of got our start in the punk rock scene. 
[02:56:00]  Now, as we finally came to room temperature, we got a little more dexterous with our fingers  and we started playing more heavy metal.  We moved into the heavy metal kind of zone, but we took all our fans with us from the punk  rock zone.  Well, now what you've got, after 25 years of this never-ending plateau, that is my career,  we have got whole generations of GWAR fans coming in.  For instance, last year, it was GWAR dude, his child, and his mother, all wearing GWAR suits 
[02:56:30]  covered in blood, begging for me to blow a filthy disease load of odorous semen right  in their faces.  The old lady was loving it.  So our demographic is slowly spreading, very, very slowly.  Like most bands, they'll come out, they'll do okay, they'll put out a couple of hit records,  and they'll slowly decline until finally they're playing the state fair.  With GWAR, it's been like a never-ending, slightly inclined plateau.  Every year, it gets a little bit bigger. 
[02:57:00]  Now that I'm on your show, I can only think that it's right around the corner, whatever  that is, but for GWAR to finally bust out and do everything that we know GWAR can do,  I mean, it doesn't matter if we get fat or old.  Right.  You know, I'll just paint another six-pack.  I might even have eight-pack abs.  You can paint as many abs as you want on that.  I can, yeah, and I really can't even paint.  So it's family entertainment now is what you're saying.  Yes, yes, it's 25 years of good family entertainment as long as your family are a bunch of pig-fucking sodomites. 
[02:57:30]  That has to get really hot on stage.  No, no, no, no.  When I was born, I was dipped into a pool of lava, so it's just like, yeah, it doesn't really bug me.  That's easy.  He's got an answer for everything.  And the shoulder, I'm trying to see what they are.  They're like skulls or something.  Oh, okay, cool.  I hear he's a big U2 fan.  Yeah, a lot of people are like, Odorous, why are you such a fag? 
[02:58:00]  And I'm like, I don't know.  Actually, it's a funny story.  U2 actually invited me to a show one time.  And they'd seen a copy of Phallus in Wonderland, a movie we actually got nominated for a Grammy.  That was hilarious.  But we got nominated for this fucking Grammy.  And YouTube wanted to use one of the characters from the show, from the movie, in their big zoo tour.  Right.  So we went up to D.C., we saw the show, and then they put me in this room to meet with Bono.  And while I was in the room, all I did was rag on Bono and how fat he looked because he was cramming his face with tartar sauce-filled donuts the whole show. 
[02:58:30]  Then I looked up and saw the security camera and realized that probably Bono was in the room right next to me going,  That fucking wanker, as he just crammed tartar sauce-filled donuts into his big, fat, corpulent, child-molesting Irish fuckface.  Can you sing a U2 song for us?  I'm very angry.  Oh, yeah.  Give us a little song. 
[02:59:00]  Give us some U2.  In a little while, surely you'll be mine.  In a little while, you'll be there.  That's what he sang to Joey on his deathbed.  In a little while, if you hadn't anointed all that carbonic spot remover, maybe your brain would still be there.  I'm so fucking rich.  I get pretty annoyed at that band, actually.  Maybe I don't like him that much. 
[02:59:30]  He does tend to do a lot of good for the world.  And I hate that.  For Africa and AIDS.  We don't want to stop AIDS.  There's too many people out there anyway.  I mean, I believe people are like, Odorous, where do you weigh in on health care?  I'm like, let the sick die!  Call the herd.  Yeah, call the freaking herd here.  Come on.  Execution for parking tickets.  This is my idea.  That would be nice.  Yeah.  Are you an Obama fan?  I don't know.  I guess he's kind of funny.  One thing I have noticed about him is that he's black. 
[03:00:00]  Wow.  And that is a big change from the way things usually go.  And I tell you, it's funny.  Like, everyone in America is like, oh, whoa, we got a black president.  I'm like, you fucking dolts.  The whole rest of the world has had black presidents, female presidents, Ecuadorian.  I believe the president of Ecuador is a black Ecuadorian woman or something like that.  It's like, it's not exactly a groundbreaking decision.  But, you know, I must say, everyone's starting to rag on Obama right now, and he's starting  to look positively harried. 
[03:00:30]  And I just want everyone to remember Bill Clinton's first year when he was doing that  whole gaze in the military thing.  He's off to a shaky start, but give him a break.  We absolutely, you know, it's just like so funny to me the way the conservatives are just  piling on.  They're like, as soon as he does anything, they're like, oh, he's fucking up.  Oh, everybody hates him.  Oh, it's a disaster.  Oh, no.  We need to get Rush Limbaugh in here immediately.  Rush, get your face out of that tray of Oxycontin.  We're talking to a monster.  We really are.  It's very frightening. 
[03:01:00]  And it's a big fan of Obama.  Oh, those were.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No one likes the Obama.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't mind him.  I mean, I've never met him.  So, I don't know.  I don't think he wants to meet me.  I love it because his hand is always in my fucking pocket.  Yeah, did you see him kill that fly?  Yeah.  That was pretty, I mean.  You liked that?  I liked that.  Yeah.  I'm not really interested in swatting flies, but I thought that was pretty cool.  I thought it was a good start.  Good start.  Now we need you to kill something else.  Barack. 
[03:01:30]  What, are those worms coming out of your face?  Yes, they're worms.  And I'll tell you one thing about my worms, they're high.  Yeah?  Yeah, they're high.  I'm really, like, I'm not on drugs, like, right now.  But, yeah, from when I was before, they are.  And if I wanted to catch, if you wanted to catch a little buzz here, we could throw one  in the bong.  Wow.  They would light up and...  Not really very well.  I was thinking it would be more like we could just drink the bong water.  That's kind of handy to have.  And you're very, like, masculine looking, aside from the fishnet stockings that you're wearing. 
[03:02:00]  What is that?  That's just a peek into my artistic soul.  I mean, I'm not afraid to dress up like a woman.  Show your feminine side.  Yeah, I mean, I'm not afraid to tell people that I have a vagina instead of a butthole.  And I crap out of it.  Out of the back, you have a vagina.  I got a vagina butthole.  Yeah, it kind of does double duty, if you will.  Double duty.  Yeah.  I heard a great joke the other day.  You might have heard this one.  Two guys are walking down the street. 
[03:02:30]  Pigeon shits on this dude.  And he says to his friend, hey, give me a piece of toilet paper.  His friend says, why?  It's already a half a mile away.  You're a monster, but he's telling jokes.  I'm a funny monster.  They seem to like me over at Fox.  Everyone was coming in last night and sucking on my cock.  Oh, we love you.  What were they talking about last night?  I couldn't really tell because my dick was so buried in their mouths. 
[03:03:00]  But, no, Greg and I are great buddies.  Greg Gutfeld, the host of Red Eye.  He used to be a Maxim editor.  He used to do stuff.  He's got a really hot wife from Russia.  And he is a huge Guar fan.  He's the guy that got Guar on Fox.  And I think it's really, really, really cool.  Yeah, I'm doing Red Eye tonight.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  They're great people over there.  They're a pisser, man.  They are a lot of fun.  They are a lot of fun.  And it's like, it's funny because, you know, Guar is such a proven commodity.  We have so many fans. 
[03:03:30]  You know, we're really, we've always been the very cutting edge of the underground metal scene.  And, but we really have never gotten to that super big level that we deserve to be.  I mean, I want to see Guar movies.  I want to see Guar video games.  I want to see Guar really get everything that we deserve.  And for our fans especially.  And things like Red Eye really help.  And things like being on this show, of course, guys, is a big help for Guar.  And it's very awesome that we're here today.  Maybe Guar endorsing things like Campbell's Soup and stuff like that.  You could be on, like, a soup commercial.  Actually, I've endorsed, I've just signed a contract with the Defense Department. 
[03:04:00]  And I am endorsing a new cluster bomb.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that we're going to, it's a really good one.  It's designed to kill children.  Basically, what happens is, like, when you drop it, it scatters presents everywhere.  And they explode.  Hey, what do you think of Michael Jackson?  They're burying him today.  Oh, it's a tragedy.  It's a tragedy.  But I can tell everyone, you know, it would be a tragedy if Michael Jackson was indeed dead.  But I have inside information that he staged his own death and is at this moment in Antarctica with the rest of Guar getting ready to make a triumphant return to the stage this fall on the Guar tour. 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  Wow.  So I would go to every Guar show then.  You bet.  We're going to be moonwalking.  And we're going to be shooting drugs into our neck.  We're going to find out if that nose is real. 
[03:05:00]  And if there's a hole there, I'm going to stick my dick in it.  Or at least the very front part of it.  Yeah.  The cuttlefish.  The cuttlefish with my deadly slit slut.  I just came up with that slit slut.  Will that thing shoot jizz today or what?  No, it's not.  I'm sorry, guys.  He doesn't have any jizz.  I have to start masturbating at least a week in advance in order to get my nut.  I could run it downstairs and maybe have a bus run over it a few times.  There you go.  Don't you have any fat, ugly Korean women around here?  That might work. 
[03:05:30]  With back pimples and knee hair.  You'll scare that woman.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah, women are afraid of me.  They can't handle my girth and my fake six-pack.  She ran away.  My fake six-pack.  We love the fake six-pack.  Is there a woman in your life?  Well, Odorous is a confirmed bachelor.  Oh.  You know, but that doesn't mean there's not a woman in my life.  There are all kinds of women.  I like to think of it more like Odorous is more like in their lives. 
[03:06:00]  Like my dick is in their butt kind of.  Gotcha.  Okay.  Yeah.  I've got some girlfriends, this and that, and most of them.  Actually, my current girlfriend is a dead dog.  Well, that's handy, actually.  Yeah, Pookie the Wonder Dog, that's the first song on.  We were hanging out with Phil from Pantera, and like someone asked him about Guar, and he's  like, man, Guar, man, they suck, man.  Man, they got a song called, I'm in love with a dead dog. 
[03:06:30]  Man, what's a great name for a song?  I don't get it.  A lot of jealousy out there.  Yeah, a lot of, between Adam Carolla and Phil, and who else?  I don't know.  That bitch who got her teeth knocked out and her fingertips chopped off.  You know?  The model?  Yeah.  She had a nice wreck.  I think they identified her by her implants.  They did, by the serial number on her implant. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's how they identified her, for real.  Are you shitting me?  Nope, that came out yesterday.  Wow.  He is right.  That's so interesting.  She was kind of weird looking, you know?  She had that kind of, like, hot look, but, like, kind of inbred at the same time, you  know?  Yeah, not wrong with that, though.  No, no.  I'm supporting inbreeding, definitely.  Yeah, yeah.  You, uh, I was looking at a picture of, you know, somebody who, uh, I guess says they're  you.  That's some guy named, uh, Dave.  Oh, yeah.  That guy's so annoying.  He, he really, um, doesn't look like somebody that would... 
[03:07:30]  He's an asshole.  He goes around everywhere telling people that he's me.  Yeah.  Yeah, and if I could ever get in the same room as that motherfucker, I'd choke the life  out of him.  Brockie, you better watch out!  Odorous is after you!  See, that just looks like a normal dude.  It looks like a...  What a queer...  What is he, got a thing of baked beans with him?  Yeah.  Look at him.  He's on the computer with his laptop.  Yeah, I'm looking at a guy.  It just looks like a normal dude you'd hang out with, have a few beers.  He looks gay to me. 
[03:08:00]  He doesn't look normal at all.  But that's you!  No, it's not!  I don't believe you!  I don't believe you!  Hi, honey!  Hot chicks are here!  Oh, look, they're walking right by not even really looking.  Yeah, they don't want to.  If they look, they'll be hooked.  One look, you're hooked.  My dick is up your butt.  So what?  I guess a lot of guys come into the shows, mostly.  Yeah, it's a lot of gay men love Gwar.  Because of my long-standing tradition of actually orally servicing my fans after the show. 
[03:08:30]  A lot of bands won't give their fans suck jobs, but that's always been a thing that Gwar did for people.  And I want everyone out there to know that if you want to come back after the show, stand out by the trash dumpster in a puddle of puke,  and get your dick sucked by odorous shirungus, I don't care if it's covered in scabs and herpes.  I don't even care if you come or not.  I just want your dick in my mouth.  That's a lot of cocks, too.  A lot.  Yeah.  The audience likes getting involved in the shows, too. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  And this is a big thing for Gwar.  Getting eaten by the monster is like fucking, you know, huge.  Oh, yeah.  We're nothing without our fans.  And there's something about Gwar.  It kind of makes everybody equal.  Like when you're spraying your pus and your phlegm and your guitar and your bile, oh, and your blood.  Blood, yes.  Like after the first song, everybody is like bright red.  So it kind of like is a way of breaking down society's barriers.  That's the way I like to look at it.  You know something?  I never would have looked at that.  But it's true.  It really levels the playing field when everyone is covered with syphilitic semen. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, syphilitic.  It certainly does.  Are we hitting it off?  Yeah, I think we're doing all right.  I think you're all right, man.  I understand you had my buddy Al Jurgensen up here one time.  That fucking guy could tell a story.  Oh, I got a good Al Jurgensen story.  First time we met Al, he was working for us on Scum Dogs of the Universe.  And, you know, Gwar was sitting there in the studio.  All of a sudden heard this motorcycle.  And all of a sudden the door to the control room smashed open. 
[03:10:00]  Al drove his motorcycle into the control room, wrecked it into the wall,  got off the fucking thing, went over to the console,  laid out a mirror, spelt the word Fugazi in cocaine,  and then snorted the entire thing.  He didn't even leave me an eye.  Then he went on to work for three days straight,  mixing one song after which he passed out underneath the console.  Now that is a professional.  That's rock.  Didn't he fucking ostrich?  That was the story he told on our show, right? 
[03:10:30]  Something like fucking an ostrich, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, they broke into the zoo in Amsterdam and one of his dudes fucked an ostrich.  Yeah, yeah.  Love that.  Love that.  But see, the thing is, what they didn't understand is that in Amsterdam,  there's no need to break into the zoo to fuck an ostrich.  No, you could probably do it right there on the street.  Yeah, I mean, there's a whole street dedicated to it.  We got a lot of GWAR fans on the phones,  and I don't know if we're going to be able to get headphones on that ridiculous head of yours.  Well, you could just, yeah, they blow up.  But we got Josh from Virginia. 
[03:11:00]  He wants to know why you guys, GWAR, were banned in Richmond, Virginia.  Well, what happened was it was something to do with my dick hanging out,  and this is what happens over and over again.  People don't buy, the police will not buy the defense that it's a fish.  That's what we stuck with for many years.  My lawyer actually said to say it's a fish, and that worked for a while.  I was arrested in North Carolina for the dissemination of obscenity back in the 90s,  and we actually had to go to trial for this thing. 
[03:11:30]  And I shit you not, the judge's name, this has nothing to do with the question,  but it's just funny, the judge's name was Richard Boner.  Yeah, and I'm not kidding.  I mean, on the docket behind me that day in court was a gang of criminal circus midgets.  So my dick has brought me a lot of places.  We were not really banned in Richmond.  What happened was everyone was just terrified to do a show  because what typically happens is the ABC is always trying to shut down clubs 
[03:12:00]  for some ridiculous reason.  I mean, they're supposed to be the alcoholic beverage thing.  They're supposed to help people get drunk.  But anyway, so they basically used GWAR as an excuse to shut down some clubs  that they wanted to shut down.  So for about three or four years, we didn't get to play in Richmond,  but it wasn't much of a ban.  After a while, we were just like, you know, maybe we should just start playing  and see what happens.  And, you know, nobody arrested us, so we're good again.  We got actually banned from Canada for like nine years,  and the way they did that is they just lied to us about where it was, 
[03:12:30]  and we just couldn't find a fucking place.  And that's pretty bad.  I mean, Canada's pretty big.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go to Footer.  And Footer's on the phone.  He's a regular to the show.  And Footer, you might be able to hear through the headphones over there.  What's up, boys?  What's up, Footer?  Real quick, yeah, I went to a GWAR show.  It was a fucking while ago, probably like eight years ago.  And one of the chicks that you used to feed to your fucking monster,  I ended up fucking banging her and her girlfriend for like the entire weekend afterwards. 
[03:13:00]  So thanks to GWAR and their disgusting show, bang a threesome.  Nice.  Yeah, it's great.  We actually, we had a thing called the World Maggot,  this giant worm that lives under the drums,  and we would sacrifice women to it.  And the sex-o-cutioner would help them through there.  But it was really funny.  He would like, he was such a pervert.  He would like get inside of it,  and as the girls were like being passed to the back of the stage,  he would basically like molest them underneath the drum russ.  We would see these chicks come staggering out, you know, 
[03:13:30]  comb-glazed and dizzy.  They'd have to crawl through this maggot.  Yeah, and there was like a dude inside there waiting for him  with his dick hanging out saying,  basically, you're never going to get out of here unless you blow me.  That's perfect.  Oh, yeah, we're pretty good.  Oh, fucking A.  We're pretty good.  That's just like going to a U2 show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking A, man.  That actually, I could actually hear him, I think.  Oh, yeah, okay.  All right.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Odorous.  What's your price of flight?  He's singing 80s music.  Odorous.  Anyway, just while everyone is laughing,  I just want to take this opportunity to plug  Gwar's new album, Lust in Space.  We debuted on the top 100 for the first time,  debuting at 96.  We won't stop until we get all the way to 94. 
[03:14:30]  Hey, we can play a song off the new Gwar album.  What do you want to hear?  Let Us Slay?  Yeah.  We just did a video for this.  Yeah.  And I have no idea what it's going to look like,  but I'm pretty sure that I'm in it.  I should hope so.  All right.  Should we say goodbye to Odorous?  Yeah, get rid of me.  I'm about done with this shit.  Well, we're going to play the song now.  Oh, okay.  It's your guy's show.  I'll stay all day.  I think this was a perfect first appearance.  Yeah.  I want you to leave with them wanting more there. 
[03:15:00]  Do you think that maybe they can come back with me?  How long have you been trying to get on our show?  I know we've said no.  Probably a dozen.  A month.  A month's years, maybe.  I don't know.  But all I can say is, you know, you guys let us on unlike some people named Howard Stern.  Well, he misses out there.  I know.  I mean, am I not erudite, sensual?  Yes.  My voice has almost a caramello quality. 
[03:15:30]  Yes.  It's very good.  He sounds like Ozone from the old days, Ant.  He also sounds like Jesse Ventura.  Yeah, I can go with the Jewish thing.  I can talk like an old dandified fop.  And I can also rock the New York shit.  I'm basically completely schizophrenic.  I'll be whatever you want, except sober.  Yeah.  I would try to stay drunk on my coffee, I say.  Yeah.  All right.  Let us slay.  It's the latest song from Gwar's new album.  What is it?  Lust in Space?  Lust in Space is out now on Metal Blade Records. 
[03:16:00]  I want to thank Odorous for stopping by today.  Hey, it's been a great time.  Welcome to my next appearance.  Wow, you don't know when an out isn't out, huh?  Jesus.  What were you going to say, Odorous?  I don't know.  I just really appreciate you guys having us on the show.  You made a lot of Gwar fans very happy today.  And hopefully be seeing you guys in the future.  Come see us on the tour.  We're playing here at Irving Plaza.  I would love for you to be our guest and return some of this wonderful hospitality you've shown us today. 
[03:16:30]  I could hang out in the maggot.  You could come hang out by the maggot and get raped by an old man.  You keep saying thanks for having us, but you're the only one in the studio.  I know.  I'm a little confused by that.  I'm completely multiple personality.  He's probably in contact with the rest of the guys.  Oh, yes.  They're big fans.  They're very jealous they're not here right now.  But, yeah, I always speak in the collective.  The collective that is the mighty Gwar.  All right.  You want to set up this song?  Give it the big intro.  The big over the top.  Let Us Slay is a song all about the human's desire to embrace war as a natural means of population control. 
[03:17:00]  It addresses the basic hypocrisy of existence.  The Ten Commandments say thou shalt not kill, yet George Bush will fry 20 people this week, even though he's not the president anymore.  Anyway, it's basically saying war is great.  Let Us Slay.  He didn't do that as president.  He killed all kinds of people, didn't he?  Yeah, well, all right.  I was thinking the death penalty.  You're right.  People are, you know, if they're worried about the death penalty here, they should try Saudi Arabia.  They behead you and publicly crucify you. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  But you have to be Nigerian.  Here's Let Us Slay from Lust in Space.  Gwar.  Odorous, a pleasure, man.  Thank you, guys.  Don't!  Let Us Slay. 
[03:18:00]  Let Us Slay.  It is the era of calamity.  And I see this with perfect clarity.  There never was an illusion of parity.  I've got no time for your crippled Christ.  We have no need for your crippled Christ.  And we never lack for your advice.  We don't have to hide a genocide. 
[03:18:30]  The fear is more when they know that we don't lie.  It's gone beyond hatred this time.  You learned that you're going to crime.  I choose the dagger to keep in your guts.  I'll put it under this time.  Let us group you and� learn the wrong way.  We hope you don't have to hide you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:19:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  On your feet  Stay  Obedious to slavery 
[03:19:30]  Don't give them a sword  And then not let them use it  Send them to war  And then make them lose it  This is a vow  Don't want to defuse it  Death is the answer  Death is the answer  No time for life  Time for the knife  Time for the sword  Jesus is born  Let your mutation 
[03:20:00]  The perfect life form  Born for born  Let them slay  Let them slay  Let them slay  Let them slay  The loss of blood won't go away  Let them slay  Let them slay  Let them slay  Let them slay  Let them slay  Let them slay  Let them slay  Let them slay  We've got no time for the gift of Christ  And we'll never let for your advice 
[03:20:30]  Don't have to lie  Lie, lie, lie  I do believe it's all the time  The gift of Christ  The gift of Christ  The gift of Christ  I do believe it's all the time  They're always calling for the sacrifice  Everybody comes, it's very nice  Last and last  I do believe it's time to die  Let them slay 
[03:21:00]  Live read for Guinness  Oh, yes  Instant feedback  They're all checking out your tweet  Yes, I just tweeted  Odorous has just left the studio from GWAR  And I think he had a fine first appearance  I liked it a lot  Yes  Very funny monster  In stores now  But he got up off the chair  And, well, his sweaty ass  Pretty much destroyed one of the Opie and Anthony chairs in studio  We didn't notice that 
[03:21:30]  Because he was sitting down  In his fishnet stockings  When he got up to leave and turned around  You just saw his ass  His ass is bare  It's just a bare ass  And it was sweating profusely  Because that chair now has  Odorous sweat ass stains  Ass sweat  Ass sweat  He doesn't look as manly when he's walking away from you  No, no, no  Not as frightening monster alike  We should have somebody sniff the sweaty chair 
[03:22:00]  Well, where's E-Rock?  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock hasn't done shit for us lately  Oh, E-Rock!  Oh, E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock, sniff Odorous's chair  Tell us what the sweaty, um, Odorous chair smells like  Now look at the imprint and see right where the bong would have been  Yeah, pick a good spot on the chair  Right where his coolie hole would be  Okay  And give it a good sniff  Just smells like 
[03:22:30]  Not bad  Damp  Not bad  Wow, how about that?  Odorous isn't very odorous  No, not really  It's like a potpourri to you, huh?  No, but it's all wet  I just put my hand here on the back  It's all on the back of the chair  The chair is soaked  I was saying, like  Wear that fucking costume, dude  Come on  Under the lights of a stage  He must be sweating like a pig  Yeah, I think so  How does he not have abs?  You like the Odorous interview there, E-Rock?  Yeah, I'm not really a GWAR fan  But he was very entertaining 
[03:23:00]  Yeah  I know a few GWAR fans  The GWAR fans are like  About time, fuckers  Alright  Relax  What do you want from us?  Bastards  We didn't know he could do good radio  Is this the guy that was just in the suit?  Is that him?  Open the door  Who's that?  Open the door  I want to get him on the air  This is definitely the guy  But he will not play it that way  Get him in the studio  Get him in the studio for a second  Is that him?  Hey, who's this guy? 
[03:23:30]  Hey, who are you, man?  What's up?  Guys, did you see that Odorous dude in here?  Yeah  That dude is fucked up  I barely got out of here  I barely managed to sneak in  He's leaving now  I think I'm safe  Yeah, I think you're okay  Wait, so you're not the guy?  That's my story  And I'm sticking to it  No, I'm just a regular old Dave Brockie  I've been a Slave Pit artist  Slave Pit is the production company  That came up with Guar  And has supported it  And loved it  And nurtured it  And cherished it  For 25 years now  And this is the 25th year 
[03:24:00]  Our freaking business  Has been scratching an existence  Out of a hostile world  But  Well, you've been working with Guar  For 25 years  Yeah  And Odorous, right?  As Odorous, yes  I would imagine at this point  You know how to impersonate him  Yeah, we were looking at your  Sweaty chair  That is really gross  That got twittered, by the way  And I just sit right back down  Yeah, on Red Eye  Apparently I left a really bad stain  On the chair  And then like the guest behind me  Came on  And they're like  Your thongs 
[03:24:30]  Like left this stain on there  And this chick like sat on it  And just like immediately  Ruined her dress or something  Probably impregnated her too  We've always managed to get ourselves  In a lot of trouble  I remember the first time  One of the first times  I came up to New York  Because we, you know  We came from Richmond, Virginia  It's a really small  Kind of backwards  Little southern town  Roadrunner Records  Like flew me up here  And we all were, you know  We were going to go talk to Roadrunner  About getting this thing  So we decided we would wear our costumes  To the meeting  And it really impressed them  So we put the costumes on  We put blood all over us 
[03:25:00]  We came in through the lobby  And everyone was like  Oh my god  We walked upstairs to Roadrunner  And then sat down  On a brand new office suite  Of white leather couches  And destroyed them  And the meeting was just over  And we couldn't understand  We're like  What?  What happened?  Just because you ruined  Their fucking couch?  Just because we ruined  Their couches, yeah  Also, we wouldn't sign  A seven record deal  I think that had something  To do with it as well  Where you get nothing  Until the eighth record  We hung in there really well  Like when we came out 
[03:25:30]  With Gwar  We didn't want to sign  A big long contract  Because we just saw  You know  It happening over and over again  Bands would sign  Five to seven record deals  And after two records  You know  The labels would give up  On these bands  But they would all  You're still under contract  Yeah, they would shelve them  And we're just like  We're not going to do that  So the first two records  We did were one-offs  And we had a lot  Of really interesting experience  Like we went to this  This company called Master  From England  And they gave us  A lot of money  For one record  And then all of a sudden  They just disappeared  Like their office was empty 
[03:26:00]  And they weren't  Picking up the phone  And we're like  What's going on?  Then all these distributors  Started calling us  From all over the world  Like, hey  Where's that next Guar album?  And basically what they've done  Is they've sold Guar  They've licensed two records  Got all the advances  Gave us part of it  Took the rest  And buggered off to New Zealand  Wow  Scumbags  That learned us pretty quick  Getting fucked in the music business  That's a surprise, right?  Yeah, that never happens  That never happens to fans  Yeah, luckily we've been on  You know, Metal Blade  Is a lot like Guar 
[03:26:30]  In that they're survivors  You know, they've been around forever  They've always put out good music  Brian Slagle and Mike Faley  And the whole crew over there  You know, we actually  We've been with Metal Blade  For a long time  And for some stupid reason  We went with this other label  For a little while  Just because they had some  They were going to actually  Like the royalty rate  Was really good  We're like, okay  It's not a huge advance  But we're like getting  40% royalty  So let's do this thing  First album again  Was great  Then it was like  You're calling the thing up  I was like  This number has been disconnected  They had this huge office  Here in Manhattan  That like within a week 
[03:27:00]  Or like within a couple months  It went from like 12 employees  To four employees  To one employee  Doing it out of his apartment  And so it's just like  Yeah, it's just rife  It's completely rife with scumbags  And it's overly difficult  It really is  The arts and music  Are so under supported  In this country  It's kind of a good thing  In a way  Because the cream  Does rise to the top  You have to be good  You have to be dedicated  If you want to get anywhere  With it  But it does put a stifle 
[03:27:30]  On a lot of creativity  But then again  You don't want it  To be like Europe  Where everyone is getting  Money from the government  And they've got  This kind of like  Government funded  Pompous attitude  Oh, I hate the government  You know  It's just like  I hate America  And that's why  I'm wearing Levi's  And Nikes  And watching  The Tarantino movie  You know  God damn  It's weird  I talk just as much  As Odorous does  I don't know  It's great to hear  The whole business end  Of it though  Of course  It's a fascinating thing 
[03:28:00]  I've been  With the same voice  I've been doing it  For so long now  That  And it's always been  So real  I mean  I know that sounds  Kind of weird  But like  The artists  And the musicians  That do GWAR  Really do it  Because they love it  And because we really  Feel like we're  Fulfilling a need  That society has to have  You know  And I've been waiting  For somebody to do  A more outrageous show  Than us  But nobody has  Yeah, no one's really  Come to the table  With that one  It's all about  The comedy with GWAR  You know  We're not trying  Obviously  We're not taking 
[03:28:30]  Ourselves too seriously  And you know  And people will make  That mistake  You know  Like serious metalheads  Oh yeah  They're not really  From outer space  I've had people  Ask me honestly  Like hey  Odorous  What's the scene like  In Antarctica  And I'll go  I'll be like  Oh it's pretty bleak  Yeah  Just some like  Norwegian scientists  And some penguins  You know  Pretty bleak  How did you know  You'd be able to breathe here  All right  Scurry off 
[03:29:00]  So we've been like  You know  GWAR has been  Like I say  The never ending plateau  It's like  We've always been  At the cutting edge  Of performance  Rock or whatever  You want to call  What it is that we do  In fact you really  Can't label it  It's just GWAR  And  But I really do feel  GWAR is a band  That can last  For hundreds of years  I mean  We will breed  Replacements  For ourselves  And we'll just  You know  GWAR has a lot more  To do with  Beatlemania  Than they do  With Black Sabbath  We're a franchise  We're an idea 
[03:29:30]  We're not  A bunch of  Boring poser dudes  Who can't  Take off  Their rock and roll  Persona  When I'm done  With my character  I throw my  Bloody suit  In a costume box  And you know  And I'm Dave again  Yeah  And that has kept us  Very real  And grounded  And close to our fans  Now Dave  We talk about that  All the time  Franchising these bands  Now you get a little older  You find the next odorous  Pass on your cut  You sit home  And take a nice cut  And let those guys  Do all the heavy lifting  Oh I look forward  To that day 
[03:30:00]  Let me tell you  I do  But there's  There's bands out there  Doing pretty much  You know  Just that  They're running out  Of all their members  But the band  Continues on  Yeah  You know  That happens  All the freaking time  And with GWAR  It's  We're particularly  Made to take advantage  Of that  And I've always just  Thought GWAR  Would just be like  A relentless assault  It doesn't matter  If you haven't done  A GWAR movie  Or a GWAR video game  Or even gotten  To Japan yet  You're gonna one day  Because it's just  Wait you guys  Haven't played Japan?  No we've never been 
[03:30:30]  To Japan  We've actually had  Things  You know  The biggest problem  With getting to Japan  Is it's just  Really expensive  We have to fill  A shipping container  Full of you know  A rubber dinosaur  And all this crap  You know  It's not like  I can just go pick up  An odorous costume  In downtown Tokyo  You could probably  Get pretty close to it  But uh  Samurai thing  With a  Well also  Remember that  I was telling you guys  About the deal  With the company  That sold fake rights  Yeah it turned out  We got this letter  From Jimco  Which is a  Label in Japan  They're like  We look forward  To a new GWAR album  And big sales 
[03:31:00]  We hope to bring them  I always thought  That had something to do  With the reason  We never got back  To Japan  Like I'm sorry  About that  But it's like  Sooner or later  It's gonna  Crack  You know  People are just  Gonna freaking say  You know what  GWAR is just  Not gonna stop  The guys that work  For GWAR  The guys that I  Lucky enough  To have hooked up  Hooked up with  You know  They're just  I mean there's like  We got to the point  That we really  Couldn't do anything else  This is what we do  You know  And I think GWAR 
[03:31:30]  Will go just as long  As  Is it still funny  It's like Jesus Christ  They're not fucking  Going away  They're not gonna go away  They're just  You might as well  Let them in  You know  Give them a TV show  Give them a video game  Send them to freaking  Mongolia  If they want  Anyway  Just get them out of America  Even people who have  Never heard GWAR  Have heard of GWAR  Which is pretty amazing  You know  And we were just  Talking about it  The whole Beavis and  Butthead thing  Was really funny  How they just love  To get up  GWAR  GWAR  GWAR  That was great  That was like  One of the first  Kind of big things 
[03:32:00]  That happened to us  I remember we were like  When we found out  That my judge wanted  To do that  We were like  Well this is great  We actually are gonna  Get some money  Out of this somehow  So  And Viacom was like  No we don't really do that  We're like  Oh come on  Come on  Come on  We gotta get some money  They're like  Well come on up to New York  And we'll talk about it  So we came up to New York  Went in there with our lawyer  And they're like  Yeah we're gonna give you  Some money  We're gonna give you  0.0006%  After we sell  200,000 copies 
[03:32:30]  And here's also  A free copy of the video game  Oh okay  And we were just like  Great  Jesus  That was like  Music business 101  Right there  Unbelievable  I still have a  Shrinkwrap copy of that game  And that game was  Ridiculously difficult to play  What it was  Is like  Beavis and Butthead  Were going to see Guar  And their dog  Had eaten their tickets  And then barfed  Little bits of the tickets  All over town  And you had to find the tickets  And apparently  I've only talked to a few  Actually John from Adrenaline  I think actually did finish that game  So  I was just coming down here 
[03:33:00]  To take a piss  I wasn't like  Trying to get back on the show  But that's cool  We're in the middle of a commercial  Yeah  We gotta get back to  The commercialry  But David  Thank you  Thank you very much  For having me  I had a blast  Now that we've seen you  Out of the suit though  I don't know if we could  Ever have you back  We'll think about it  No you'll be back  Hell yeah  Yeah  You had a great  Great appearance  Thank you David  Thanks man  Had a blast  David aka Odorous  From Guar  Anthony Guinness  Yes  Guinness Beer  2009 marks the 250th
