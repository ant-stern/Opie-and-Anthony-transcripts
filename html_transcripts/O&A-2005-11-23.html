<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the usual chaotic banter between Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Drew Boogie, who was in the studio.  The conversation started with sexually explicit jokes and insults, quickly transitioning to Opie's account of a near-deafening U2 concert resulting in temporary tinnitus. This led to a discussion mocking the President's turkey pardon, suggesting a soldier be pardoned instead, and further devolving into crude jokes about turkeys and Germans.

A significant portion of the show focused on a graphic recounting of a Smoking Gun report detailing a female teacher's sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student.  The hosts reacted with sexually charged comments and laughter, extensively discussing the teacher's attractiveness and providing explicit details from the police report.  A listener called in to comment on their reaction.  This segment was interspersed with listener calls, jokes about chickens, and promotional segments. The hosts also mocked Linda Lavin's singing and discussed Thanksgiving travel difficulties. The broadcast included extensive playing and mocking of novelty songs such as "Alice's Restaurant," "Mr. Jaws," "The Streak," and "Disco Duck," with commentary that was often vulgar and crude.  Listeners called in with anecdotes, including one about a naked man tasered in the genitals, and others offered headline suggestions. Sonny Pirelli and No Filter Paul, winners of an "assault on the media" contest, were mentioned as attempting a live broadcast outside the studio.  The Vatican's statement on homosexuals in the priesthood also became comedic fodder.

Another segment started with a humorous discussion about a song and the deceased Dick Goodman, followed by promotion of their "Wow" sticker campaign designed to elicit breast flashing from women. Listener calls detailed their experiences with the stickers.  This led back to extensive discussion and audio clips related to the female teacher and 14-year-old student, with highly offensive language used by hosts and callers.  Audio clips included the teacher's court apology and purported audio of the teacher and student.  Justin from Washington called in with a positive review.  A discussion ensued about Jimmy Norton's MySpace experience.  "Alice's Restaurant" was played and heavily criticized. A Team America parody of the show was played.  Club Soda Kenny called in, discussing flight arrangements and problems stemming from a previous stunt. Pat from Minaki, a competitive eater, was mentioned as being outside the studio, discussing his ranking and training. The segment concluded with a mashup song, promotional material, and discussion of the upcoming eggnog-drinking contest.

A later segment featured Pat from Munaki detailing his estranged relationship with his family, including his deceased parents, estranged brother (who had a Major League Baseball field in his backyard), and sister's husband who considered him a "piece of shit." He discussed spending Thanksgiving alone with his pets and eating Boston Market. The hosts and guests, including Sonny Ferrelli (the "Assault in the Media" champion who brought gifts including cereal, a drill set, and gift cards), made jokes about Pat's family situation.  A significant portion focused on Pat's lack of contact with his nearby father.  The conversation included discussions about the eggnog drinking contest, other show-related business, inside jokes, and planned pranks. The show ended with the hosts throwing milk across the studio, farewells, and mention of a "Whackpack party".  Throughout the entire broadcast, profanity and sexually suggestive language were liberally used.

Like they tell you?  No, I don't want to picture them  Hello  Friends  My good friends out there  Maybe we should post pictures up of what our audience is supposed to look like 
[00:06:30]  That would be a scary sight if we actually did that, wouldn't it?  Unfortunately, we have this fucking window, and we can see what they look like, because on a daily basis they're sitting there  Today it's no-filtered Paul sitting out the window  Our listeners haven't done a sit-up in a decade  That's what we got, but they're ours  That's right, we love them  Absolutely  We got Drew Boogie in studio 
[00:07:00]  It's the day before the long weekend, so Drew's gonna help us make it a party atmosphere today  Always bring Drew in  I gotta start the show by saying I'm a mess  An absolute mess  What happened?  I was asked to the U2 concert last night  I was sitting in the pit  Literally 15 feet from the band  Ooh  And also 15 feet from the goddamn speakers  Oh, wow, yeah  That they used to fill the garden with sound  That's a problem there, my friend 
[00:07:30]  And I had earplugs, and I threw them in to look like a wimpy faggot  You were wearing plugs?  For a little bit, and then I said, you know what?  Man, when are you ever gonna have the opportunity to see U2 15 feet away?  I don't know, when are you?  So I pulled those babies out  Right, only faggots wear those, by the way  And now I'm suffering, I got, my ears are ringing like crazy  A little tinnitus  I crashed around 11, and I stayed awake all night because I could hear my ears ringing all night long 
[00:08:00]  That's the ringing and then the whoosh  Oh, yeah, it's just  Oh, oh, but wait a minute, breaking news  The president is giving the pardon to the turkey, Opie  I just saw that on the news  Every year the president pardons the turkey  Maybe when we're doing a little war thing  Yeah  Maybe he should blow off that tradition  I pardon you  How about he pardons a soldier?  Yeah, let him come home for the holidays  Yeah, that's in the middle of the action 
[00:08:30]  Why don't you go out there and pardon one soldier and let him come home for the holiday  Let him come home, imagine how happy the family would be  That's just great, saving a turkey as we're in the middle of a war  His turkey's now free  It's a free turkey  Free to go home to his family  Didn't they do a story a few years ago about how the freed turkeys are just kept in the worst conditions possible  And they told what had happened to previous presidentially pardoned turkeys  Yeah, they're just run over by trucks  Yeah, they're moved from one farm 
[00:09:00]  They're moved from one farm to another  They're not placed on, you know, a throne at a farm and become like celebrity turkey  They just go back in the pen to sit there and get their eyes plucked out by another pissed off turkey  Get shat upon by other turkeys  German fellas coming in  German guys, oh yeah, turkeys  Oh, I was pardoned by the president  You're fucking me  The pardon gives me 
[00:09:30]  You're fucking me  Turkey's not going to be eaten for Thanksgiving, I gave him a pardon  While sitting on a nice farm up in Washington State  He's going to live out the rest of his life as a free turkey  As if the sick fucking Germans don't get him  There it is, penitration 
[00:10:00]  Just a minute  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That's good  That's good  Like  Like  Oh, I love this trout  And you didn't think chickens cry

[00:11:00]  Schlecht  Das gut  Yeah  Fucking chicken fucking Nazi  Oh, just an awful group  I love that he's German  No self-respecting any other race would do that  Any other culture  There's something about being conquered when you were so close to winning the world  When you were so close to actual world domination and then getting your ass handed to you  That makes you a chicken fucking culture  And the Japs, don't get me started 
[00:11:30]  In bathtubs, fucking asses in the air, shitting on themselves  Depraved societies  I've seen footage of a guy fucking a chicken before  It's really awful  Because they got the hand just holding the little fella down  Yeah  You know, because it's like all trying to scatter with those little feathers  Of course  Of course  That little pea chicken brain  Whatever a chicken brain looks like  I'm sure  No bigger than the size of a pea  Even that little brain knows  This should not be happening  I need to get away from this 
[00:12:00]  And he can't  Get those big, strong, kraut hands around him  That German dick up him  The chicken's trying to say  Wouldn't you like to just make McNuggets, sir?  Why do we have to?  Yeah, I pardon you  So another turkey has been pardoned this holiday season, huh?  Yeah  Anyway, so I went to the U2 show  I guess that's where we're at  Yes, and your hearing is a bit

It's very cold today  It's in the 20s right now  There's no reason to be  That was fine  27 degrees here in New York  So, you know, I usually throw the shoes in the backpack  And I forgot what to say  So now I'm walking around  I can barely hear you guys  And I have no shoes  Why is it open just wearing socks in this picture?

[00:17:00]  Can I explain, Anthony?  She was deemed too hot for jail  I got  Yeah, that's the big story today  That's the headline  But  As we're in the office  Getting ready for the show  You know, we're shooting the shit  Seeing what we want to talk about today  And Anthony goes  Man, did you read that stuff  On Smoking Gun?  Yeah  What's that?  Sorry, it looked like  Pat from Munaki  Sitting at a table  That is Pat from Munaki  Pat is on  WB11 News  We are all over the fucking place  Man, we're being bombarded  Yeah, this is great  What is Pat doing on  WB11 News? 
[00:17:30]  He's doing an eating contest today  He's a professional eater  Of course he is  I'm hoping they arrested him  With a phony fireman's outfit  And a smoke bomb  Creep  Well, a week from today  He'll be doing the eggnog drinking contest  Right here in the studio  Let's wait until it snows  And follow the nine-toed footprints  Find him anywhere  So we got Pat doing that today as well  Maybe he'll check in after his eating experience  But we're in the office  We're shooting the shit 
[00:18:00]  Trying to figure out what we're going to do today  And all of a sudden Anthony goes  Hey, did you read that smoking gun stuff?  The transcripts of the hot teacher?  Yeah  And your quote was something like  I couldn't stop reading it  And getting a boner  It was rod-inducing  I defy any guy to read this  And not get a rod  I agree  And it's a great read  I gotta tell you  And the fact that she is so hot  And so sick 
[00:18:30]  There's something about that  That's fantastic  And 14 is  You know, it's bad  Don't get me wrong  That's bad  You might be twisting this kid up for a while  But, in some cases  It's just, you know  Maybe he's mature for his age  And believe me  He was enjoying it  Somebody ratted him out  He wasn't the one that went  This is terrible  Of course he wasn't going to be the one  To rat himself out  No, you know how he got caught?  The aunt actually saw them together somewhere 
[00:19:00]  And told the mother  It was actually not the friend  It was the aunt  Yeah, and rumors started circulating  That people were hearing  Because, again, also as a kid  You probably can't keep this to yourself  They did a lot of driving around  And had sex in the back seat of a vehicle  While this 14-year-old's 15-year-old cousin  Drove around  So they would drive  They'd put the back seats down  And he would watch his 14-year-old cousin  And this hottie have sex 
[00:19:30]  Listen to this  Do we have any sexy music?  I do  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam  Yeah, I like it  Here's Drew Boogie  Sick  I thought you were going to go with, like, a little  Let's get it on  Ooh, Opie  I guess this is a detective talking  He told me the first time  That Ms. Lefebvre  And his cousin  Had sex  He was driving Ms. Lefebvre's vehicle 
[00:20:00]  On Highway 200  Near the mall  Uh, Mr.  We'll call him Doe  Mr. Doe  Mr. Doe stated  He remembered driving under the underpass  Uh, and shortly thereafter  They were having  Uh, done having sex  As he was driving  He told me the second time  Ms. Lefebvre  Had sex with his cousin  In, uh, Ocala  He had driven them  To Brick City Park  He told me  He believed both acts took place in the city 
[00:20:30]  But that was all he could remember  Why aren't the sexy parts highlighted?  Who highlighted this?  Who's the faggot that highlighted this?  I got a problem with this  Who's the homosexual?  Travis, you highlighted this?  Why?  You don't know what's hot and what's not hot  There's, I, I'm holding probably  Twelve pages  Of hotness  Alright, nine pages of hotness here  You highlighted driving directions  No, I  Nathaniel gave that to me 
[00:21:00]  Ten minutes before the show started  And I was highlighting it in there  I didn't think you guys were going to go to it  So early  But he marked  What I should highlight  Because I didn't read the whole thing  Again, again  Passing the vodka  Absolutely  To somebody else  You highlighted this  Yeah, I didn't  I, he  You can see there's little marks  Yeah  Next to the things that are highlighted  That's what he marked  So that I could highlight that stuff  Well  See, here's like  I didn't read the whole thing  Take pants off  Passenger seat  Observed that her legs were spread

[00:22:00]  And he first got on a classroom couch  After she seductively  Sidled up next to him  In black terry cloth shorts  And thong panties  See, that's  By the way  My part of  My  I got a copy of that story  Here in front of me  That wasn't highlighted  How was that not  What was highlighted  How do you not highlight  The hotness in this story  How do you not highlight  The main downstairs  Watching a movie  The cousin  She  They went upstairs  Started kissing in the bedroom  She pulled his penis out 
[00:22:30]  And performed oral sex on him  That wasn't highlighted  Dude, look  I'm reading right here  Someone should be fired  Did not have sex  Because she had advised him earlier  That she was menstruating  He stated he did not orgasm  And she suddenly stopped performing sex  Then they went downstairs  Watched TV  She drove him  To the basketball game  Then drove him to the basketball game  And back to the residence  It was at this point  In the story  I realized that  Ms. Lefebvre  Picked both juveniles up  For the residence  Then 
[00:23:00]  Drove back  To Ocala  And during that  That trip  She performed oral sex  On him again  In the back seat  Somewhere between  Tampa  And Ocala  He stated  He stated this time  He did have an orgasm  From the blowjob  Probably right in her mouth  Of course it was  Then they're just  Fucking like crazy  Black terry cloth  Thong  Pulled out his penis  Out of his shorts  And placed it in her vagina  He stated he was not wearing a condom

[00:37:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:38:00]  Drew Boogie in the zone today, man.  Thanks, Drew.  We're back to the O.B. and Anthony program.  Let's go right to the phones for a second here.  Say hi to Jeff in Minnesota.  Jeff, what's up?  I got to give props to Stan and Travis, because that was the funniest fucking promo I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, damn it.  I wasn't listening.  Oh, you got to hear it again.  The wow promo they just had.  It was hysterical.  Which one was it?  Steve made that recently.  Oh, it was Travis tore a wow sticker off his ass. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, really?  It was hysterical.  Very, very cool.  Well, thank you, Jeff.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Keith in New Jersey.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  You know, it's funny.  I grew up, I'm 37.  I grew up in two major markets in Jersey between Philly and New York.  I used to do radio, and I never heard this fucking song until last Thanksgiving.  And Jason, if you're listening, I'm bringing you a pie tomorrow.  All right. 
[00:39:00]  Alice's Restaurant by Arlo Guthrie.  Yeah.  It has become a Thanksgiving tradition on many radio stations across America.  For how many years?  Maybe they've done it before.  I have worked at three radio stations where we played Artho, Artho, Arlo Guthrie Thanksgiving morning.  Yeesh.  I don't know why, I don't know where this tradition started, but that person should be killed.  Oh, it's ponderous.  Well, the radio column in the Daily News today?  Yeah.  We have this radio column in the New York paper that is just a waste of space. 
[00:39:30]  An absolute waste of space.  Who's that?  David Hinckley's radio column in the Daily News.  There's so much action going on in New York radio, but he decides to do a whole column on Arlo Guthrie and the Alice's Restaurant thing.  There's never any controversy in his column.  It's never...  He never throws in any opinion or anything.  It's just what's going on and the most boring, dull things that are going on in radio. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Why not point out that K-Rock is on the brink of disaster, of complete disaster, of meltdown, of epic proportions.  Well, they hired a grandma to talk dirty to 18 or 34-year-old males.  So, I guess, yeah, I guess you're right about that, Anthony.  Holy shit.  What the hell's going on in New York radio?  It's a heck of a move.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:40:30]  They're going to fail miserably.  There's a station here in New York, they're doing a format called Free FM.  See, that's how they're going to combat satellite radio.  Yeah.  They're going to pretty much tell you that you can listen to radio for free still.  It's Free FM.  Free FM, and it's talk, and it's going to be cutting edge.  Yeah, sure it is.  No, it's not.  It's not because you're not allowed.  Everyone funny has been just off radio.  Yeah.  Just there's no one funny in commercial radio.  I'm sorry.  There's no reason to be on commercial radio anymore. 
[00:41:00]  And then there's a huge satellite radio battle going on between us and Howard,  and our fans are beating the shit out of each other and stuff,  and David Hinkley decides to write about Alice's Restaurant.  Yeah.  Fucking boring.  Two more helpings of Alice's Restaurant is the headline in the radio call.  Two more helpings.  No matter what else may be happening in radio,  Arlo Guthrie will be coming around tomorrow to keep things in proper balance by singing Alice's Restaurant.  Thank goodness.  The most famous modern Thanksgiving song will play at noon on Q104 here in New York City. 
[00:41:30]  Well, where else?  And then another station called WFUV, both of which consider it important enough to take an 18-minute break from their holiday weekend specials to be sure Arlo is heard.  18 minutes.  I've never heard the song.  18 minutes of drivel.  God awful.  Of drivel.  Just this story that doesn't make sense and goes on and on and on. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, God.  Does it start like a normal song?  No.  Oh, we could play a part of it, but it's 18 minutes long.  Well, I think that it's important.  Otherwise, Q104 will spend the weekend, starting today, counting down the top 1,043 classic rock songs of all time.  Are they really doing that?  Of course they are.  They fucking suck.  You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant. 
[00:42:30]  That's what it's like.  Stupid Edmund Fitzgerald song.  It's even longer than the Edmund Fitzgerald song.  Yeah, it's just another story that goes on forever that has no fucking point.  Yeah.  But there you go.  Q104, the classic rock station, will be counting down the 1,043 classic rock songs of all time.  I bet you they're going to trick us and make Stairway to Heaven third this year.  Oh, that would be a trickery.  Usually it's first or second.  And then the DJ goes on the air and he's all outraged, like,  Oh, my God, I can't even believe it. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, it was number one last year.  No.  And they never go right into number one.  They've got to take a big break.  The 20-minute commercial break.  Talk about how.  And when we come back, here it is, what we've been waiting for.  The number one song.  The top five will be probably a Zeppelin song, a Who song.  Beatles.  A Pink Floyd song.  Yeah.  Yeah, Beatles, right?  Yeah.  Some Sabbath.  And hopefully Kajagoogoo. 
[00:43:30]  Sabbath.  Which of Warpigs makes it as to 1041?  Fucking faggot classic rock station.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Listeners have voted on a new list, which will be counted down in order through Sunday.  Don't be surprised if Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven and Leonard Skinner's Freebird do well.  Like, that's news.  This is in the radio column.  Of course.  This guy's good, though, man.  I don't know.  I wouldn't have guessed that.  Good stuff. 
[00:44:00]  Howard appears on Letterman.  Outside the Letterman studio.  We completely attack Howard and all his fans with banners and all sorts of shit.  The pests go nuts.  It's a huge, huge story.  K-Rock's exploding here in New York.  It's going to be a disaster area.  And David Hinckley's writing about a stupid countdown that's happening this weekend.  Are you kidding me?  He's an irrelevant ass.  WFUV devotes tomorrow and Friday to its City Folk Thanksgiving Festival with recordings of live concert by popular WFUV artists. 
[00:44:30]  The schedule, tomorrow at 10 a.m., it's Richard Thompson.  Oh, Richard Thompson?  Ooh, what kind?  Well, I'm tuning in.  Followed by Amos Lee, then Nickel Creek, the Kennedys.  Here's one I recognize and still wouldn't listen to.  Emmylou Harris.  Ooh, she's good.  John Heyman, Josh Rouse, Randy Newman, and Dr. John. 
[00:45:00]  Holiday specials on other stations in the New York area, WABC.  What are they doing?  Well, Sean Hannity, live today and Friday from Disney World.  He went on vacation with his family and said, hey, I'll record this.  I'll broadcast.  I'll broadcast this crap.  Fly us down, first class, and I'll broadcast.  Yeah.  What is he doing at Disney World?  What could he possibly do with his show?  I don't know.  And then WBAI tomorrow will do Wake Up Call with Deepa Fernandez. 
[00:45:30]  He looks at the plight of the needy in the city.  That's followed by a special on the Un-Thanksgiving, exploring the roots of Thanksgiving as a celebration  of Europeans exterminating indigenous peoples.  Disney owns ABC, right?  Yeah.  Okay, there you go.  That must be nice to have Disney at your beck and call.  Yeah, they're just giving Disney one big commercial.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  WCBS FM, doing that jack format, will be commercial free all day tomorrow.  No, stop!  Nice.  Apparently from the last ratings, they're listener free, too.  They're running listener free.  Wow.  Yeah, why don't you promote for a day what you could get on satellite radio all year long?  Mm-hmm.  Commercial free music.  Meanwhile, the streaming version of WCBS FM, which is at cbsfm.com, and still plays oldies, 
[00:46:30]  will count down the top 101 songs of the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, starting at one tomorrow.  This is just great shit, man.  Yeah.  He is, what a bore this guy is.  He's awful.  Well, good news, WOR has Rocco DiCiparito, whatever that guy was.  The chef.  The chef guy.  He hosts his second Thanksgiving 911 show.  Oh, now, if you have any questions.  For those who need some last-minute assistance with the big dinner. 
[00:47:00]  That's right, Anthony.  So you're going to sit there and listen to the show, cook your turkey, and then if you run into a problem,  you can spend three hours on hold trying to get through to this guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Instead of maybe just getting on the internet.  Could you help?  My father's been drinking, and he just punched my mother in the throat.  In the kitchen.  Hello, chef?  Rocco, what do I do?  My soon-to-be brother-in-law is drunk, and he just found out that I had sex with his sister, 
[00:47:30]  and he said, you're busted, and he threw the turkey out the window.  What do you suggest we do?  You guys want to share your favorite Thanksgiving memories today on the program?  I got a great one.  Is it cringe-inducing?  No, not really.  No, it's not that bad.  One year, we had Thanksgiving at my brother's place.  The entire family was there, and we had little ones running around,  and the women were in the kitchen, you know, fixing the meal. 
[00:48:00]  Well, they should be.  Amen.  And the women all of a sudden realized that most of the men were nowhere to be seen.  We were in my brother's room upstairs, watching Tommy Lee give it to Pam Anderson.  Oh, when the video came out.  Nice.  And my brother was the only one that wasn't in the room, because it was his house,  so he was making sure everything was being taken care of,  so he went in search of the men, and he walks into the room,  and there's Pam really getting it from Tommy Lee. 
[00:48:30]  And he has an actual towel on his arm, and he's basically trying to find us so we could cut the turkey  and start our Thanksgiving, and he goes, you know, happy Thanksgiving, everyone.  Happy Thanksgiving to all.  As Pam's just getting railed.  What?  But I guess the Today Show is doing a Holiday 411.  If we don't have this on the air today.  1-800-BUTTER-BALL, I guess, is the number they're calling that you can call and get your turkey tips. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, we can't do that.  It's all right.  It's all right.  They'll get it for me.  No, don't worry about it.  Two boogies on our TV feed today.  That's fine.  That's worth it.  And I guess Katie Couric is helping out.  Right.  She's taking calls from people.  Right.  She's got a big old-fashioned, oldie-time switchboard.  What a funny little joke that is.  I'd like to call if I go, look, Katie, hi.  Could you help me out here?  There's something with the way I stuff the turkey is not correct because no matter how I hold it, I'm getting stuffing on my thighs. 
[00:49:30]  Just play that.  Let's go to Louie in New Jersey.  Louie.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Lou.  Welcome to the program.  Yeah, hey, you two fucking cunts don't know nothing about fucking being old.  You know what I'm saying?  How old are you, Lou?  51.  51 years young.  God bless, Lou.  Eh, I still suck. 
[00:50:00]  But anyway, it's a protest song.  What's a protest thing?  Good music?  Well, did you ever fucking hear of the draft?  Ooh.  Yeah, I heard of that draft thing, my friend.  That's what the fuck it's all about.  And I put it on to piss off my fucking mother-in-law every goddamn year.  But do you think it really addresses the issue of the draft before maybe minute 16?  No.  No.  Not at all.  Kind of by the end, I think maybe they start talking about the draft and... 
[00:50:30]  Well, it was pretty funny.  No, it isn't.  It isn't the least bit funny.  Well, hold on.  Lou thinks it...  Wait a minute.  Now, hold on, Lou.  You might...  What year is the song, Lou?  What year is the what?  The song.  I've never heard it.  68.  All right.  So Lou thinks it might be funny.  Did it start off kind of funny?  No.  It's a fucking folk song.  It's in the same era when Dylan was going to go on...  What's his name?  Ed Sullivan's show.  And he was ready to fucking do a protest song, and they told him absolutely no way. 
[00:51:00]  So he walked off.  That album that he put that song on is worth about $100,000 now.  Oh, that's wonderful.  No, it's not.  Why is it worth that much money?  I thought he had his own album out.  Because people like me, the old fucking scumbags, fucking buy shit.  But Lou, there's no such thing as a $100,000 album.  No albums worth that much money.  I have Kiss records that aren't worth that kind of money.  And they should be.  And records aren't worth what.  And those albums where there was only one track on one side always stunk out.  You bet they do. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, Arlo, how about you write a few more songs instead of one 18-minute piece of shit?  Yeah.  Shit.  The fucking old scumbag is due for Christ's sake.  I have to hear this song.  We're going to hear it.  Go ahead.  Because I like funny songs, man.  There's some funny parts to it.  All right, Louie.  Thank you.  And you should play the motorcycle song after it.  What part do you think is funny?  Give me a general idea of what part do you think is funny.  Well, he's sitting on a group W bench and a fucking guy says to him, what were you arrested  for, kid?  And he says, littering.  And they all move away from the bench.  I'm on a bench.  And you've got to see. 
[00:52:00]  You've got to hear it.  Listen to a...  We'll listen to Alice's restaurant.  We'll try to find the humor in this stupid thing.  I asked him, what am I being arrested for?  And he said, littering.  And...  She said, what am I being arrested for?  And I said, well, the 14-year-old was fucking you while his 15-year-old cousin drove around.  They made a movie out of it, too, Russell?  Oh, my God. 
[00:52:30]  It was like Porn Amour, and I'm cruising around Skinamax to find some porn.  And, dude, it comes on, and all the stuff he's in it.  And it's all these people doing heroin and stuff in a church.  At the end, one guy commits suicide, I think, just because he listened to the song.  Holy crap.  All right, let's listen to a piece of this.  It was worthy of a movie.  The only song I want to hear about a restaurant in Alice is something involving Linda Lavin,  because who doesn't love her?  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking good. 
[00:53:00]  There's a fresh new face in the new ever.  There's a new girl in town.  Oh, who the fuck thought it was a grand idea to have her sing her own theme song to the show?  The Open Anthony show is finally complete.  Anthony has finally broke out this impression.  Listen how fucking overdramatic this chore is.  Oh, I know all of it.  Going through life with blinders on. 
[00:53:30]  It's tough to see.  I had to get up, get out from under.  Now she's going to run with it.  Here it goes.  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking good.  Oh, my God.  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking good.  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking good.  There's a new girl in town, with a brand new style.  She will just pass it through, but if things work out, she's going to stay. 
[00:54:00]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  I've got yet to listen.  There's a new girl in town, and she's looking good.  I've got a fresh, freckled face in my neighbor with a vanooch. 
[00:54:30]  Bob, she should sing that song while Vic Payback rapes her and mushes her face and  will play the goulash.  Let's go to Momo.  Momo.  Yes, my friend.  What's up, Momo?  Hi, guys.  Little Jimmy.  Yeah.  I love you, Daddy.  Thank you, little fella. 
[00:55:00]  And happy birthday, baby.  Thank you.  I really dig that song.  I'm serious, though.  I like that Alex Restaurant song.  It's a good song, and it just...  All right.  Listen to me.  It's a little bitty.  Listen to me, sir.  Why do you like the song?  Why?  Yeah.  You know, honestly, because it gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling about being the holidays.  And I'm serious, man.  It really does.  It warms my cockle.  Warms your cockle.  It has nothing to do with Thanksgiving, really.  I know, but it's because it comes on every year at Thanksgiving. 
[00:55:30]  It's a constant in his life that makes him feel good.  That's right.  Well, we're about to wreck it for you forever, so hang in there.  Let's say hi to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris?  Hey, I saw Arlo Guthrie a couple years ago, and his son and daughter in the band, and  after the set break, when he came back out, his daughter didn't come out, and he said  that even my daughter doesn't like this next song, so she refuses to play it with us.  She wouldn't even come out and play it with him.  Oh, good.  There's no reason to play the song. 
[00:56:00]  It takes place around Thanksgiving.  That's why they played on Thanksgiving.  It's not a Thanksgiving dinner.  I think it's a bit of a stretch, don't you?  Let's go to Tom in Indiana.  Tom?  Hey, morning, boys.  What's going on?  Morning, Tom.  Hey, it's either the fucking parader of that stupid song, and all it is is a battle cry  to start fucking drinking before your family comes over.  Oh, is that it?  That's when you start drinking?  You know them fuckers are coming over?  I didn't do that.  The phones have exploded.  The phones just blasted.  And we've got to get everybody back. 
[00:56:30]  All right, well.  There's a fresh, freckled face in the neighborhood.  There's a new girl in town.  She didn't look like no girl, either.  No.  She looked like...  That's not a fresh, freckled face in the neighborhood.  Oh, man, that's a worn out.  There's a wrinkled old mess in the neighborhood.  There's a new...  She's trying to be all jazzy.  And remember, she started, like, singing on... 
[00:57:00]  She's going on, like, Mike Douglas or something, and that was her big thing, to get on and  sing those jazzy songs.  Is there any other Linda Lavin around?  God, I hope not.  Never on Dillette, right?  I'm sure he has it on his iPod.  I hope not.  Hey, really fast.  Good morning, America.  We got more Linda Lavin?  Oh, we do?  I got to sample a little more Linda Lavin.  The Boy You Never Can...  I don't know any of these fucking songs.  Pop one on.  Don't do the one with the...  Yeah, do that one.  The Boy From... 
[00:57:30]  Which one, Hope?  I don't know.  Let's listen to this.  Oh, yeah, there's the...  Oh, the...  Oh, the...  Isn't this the girl from Ipanema?  Yeah, so she's going to do...  Slend up like an Apollo.  He goes walking by, and I have to follow him.  The Boy From...  Why is she...  Why is she...  When we meet, I feel I'm on fire, I'm unbreathless. 
[00:58:00]  What are you doing?  I thought she was asleep after you.  If she picked a song, she can't even do like it.  It's a proper relationship.  Turn it off.  Why, when I speak, don't you punish?  Oh, why is she talking so clonish?  Oh, I wish I understood. 
[00:58:30]  When I tell him, I think he's the end.  He giggles a lot.  Holy crap.  All right, thanks.  She's fucking a fresh, freckled face.  She's got a new start, and she's a waitress.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Like you're walking into a law firm, you dumb whore.  Like to give Linda Lavin a good teabagging right on that tannotop.  Look out.  There's a new girl in town.  That's right.  That fresh, freckled face.  Put a little oniony ball sweat on her nose.  Mary Tyler Moore is kicking your ass. 
[00:59:00]  Exactly.  At least she threw her hat in the air, for Pete's sake.  Waiting on truckers.  Nice.  In the restaurant.  Sloppy.  Kiss my grits.  Oh, what a catchphrase.  Bad side.  Oh, she was funny every episode.  Guys, I don't know how to tell you this, but today's a very tough day to travel.  It's getaway day.  It's getaway day.  Flights will be delayed.  You'll be on the highway for many, many hours.  And the news has to remind you of that today, constantly. 
[00:59:30]  The crowds are just starting to pick up here at O'Hare for what will be one of the busiest travel days of the year.  217,000 people are expected to pass through here today on more than 2,700 flights.  But weather could be a problem at this major hub.  It has just started to snow.  Bad weather is already taking the joy out of this holiday weekend for some travelers.  From New York to Atlanta, dozens of flights were canceled.  High winds delayed others for hours. 
[01:00:00]  The air travel is back to levels that it was four and five years ago, and that means you need time.  Many of the 37 million people expected to travel by plane and car are on a collision course with a nasty winter storm.  Forecasters predict heavy snow and ice from Minnesota to Maryland.  On the road, police in six Midwestern states are promising a show of force this holiday weekend.  I would rather write a hundred safety belt citations than to notify another family that their loved one died needlessly because they failed to buckle up. 
[01:00:30]  A hundred?  Would you? Really?  Yeah, if you're flying into Denver, make sure you call a friend.  It'll get you a snowcat.  Exactly.  You've got to get up to the hotel.  And they just sit there and stare straight ahead as the plane is going.  Don't move it in, you fucking mannequin.  Do you like ice cream, Doc? 
[01:01:00]  I heard it is a pretty big storm up there.  People are irresponsible assholes.  Assholes.  And then Larry Durker's all cold, saying, God, I should be training Apollo Creed again.  That's who that was.  Yeah, that's who that was.  I thought he looked familiar.  Larry Durker.  Let's say hi to Greg in Jersey.  Greg.  Good morning, fellas.  What's up?  This is your demographic calling.  Just wanted to let you know that none of us know who the hell you're talking about. 
[01:01:30]  Linda Lavin and references to Mike Douglas.  What is he, 65?  Dude, how old are you?  I'm 37, and I remember Alice.  Mike Douglas, I remember watching.  Yeah, I remember being, I was a kid, but I was fascinated with everything on television.  I didn't just watch cartoons, dude.  And we played the actual song to bring you into the bit.  See, that's where we're very, very smart.  Good point, Oak.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Everybody knows.  It was in syndication for years.  Jesus.  Cool.  Your argument stinks. 
[01:02:00]  Who was Linda Lavin?  Linda Lavin was Alice on the show Alice.  Remember with Vic Tabak?  No, I'm sorry.  Picture the Golden Girls without the brilliant writing and humor.  How old are you, sir?  I'm 33.  I'm 33.  That's probably...  Four years younger than me.  He might have missed it.  Yeah.  All right.  Even in syndication.  And what was the last year Mike Douglas was on?  Oh, Mike Douglas is years and years and years and years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Case in point.  Thank you, fellas.  All right, bye.  It's not always about you, douchebag. 
[01:02:30]  That's right.  I'm sure there's a few people out there that enjoyed Anthony's rendition of the theme song.  Of all ages and racial background and religious orientation that listen to this program,  how can you run the gamut?  How can you not laugh at Anthony's rendition?  Come on.  And how can you not call him out for saying people of all races and religions enjoy this  program?  We like...  People who listen to us are white and maybe a little whiter.  That's our demo.  Perhaps tan if they're in Florida. 
[01:03:00]  We like a lot of milk in our coffee.  Good point.  Oh, good point.  Just getting on the road...  We need to help pack it, okay?  ...is the biggest challenge for families like the Decayne.  Squishy pillows are the key to success.  Oh, there's a squishy pillow.  Usually I try to avoid the whole thing and just kind of get on when it's all done.  Two adults, three children, and a 150-pound dog...  Gobble.  Gobble, gobble.  ...all crammed into one truck for at least six hours.  You stay there. 
[01:03:30]  Now, one traveler we spoke with calls us the annual headache before the turkey.  We're checking the departures board here.  There are a handful of delays already this morning, and airport officials here at O'Hare  are asking people to show up more than two hours before their flight in anticipation of  the crowds and the weather.  Man, why would you fly today?  Is your family really worth it?  Yeah.  Like, you don't sit around that table and look at these fucking people and go, man, if 
[01:04:00]  I wasn't related to these people, I would have nothing in common with them, and I wouldn't  hang with them.  Yeah.  Are they really worth it?  And I hope our own Don Wicklund didn't book your flight.  They'll have more takeoff and landings than Chuck Yeager.  We actually go from LaGuardia to Islip.  We have to connect.  They don't even leave the ground.  They take the expressway.  That's a very good local joke for everybody. 
[01:04:30]  And we're not going to...  We're keeping it local.  We're not going to explain it to Alabama today.  That's right.  Half past the hour.  All right.  Why don't we play a little bit of Alice's Restaurant?  Let's just see where this goes.  I don't know.  This is where the break began.  I have the lyric sheet.  It's five pages long.  Yeah.  Five full text pages long.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I would be impressed. 
[01:05:00]  Well, I guess he did have to, because he had to learn this.  He had to memorize this, write it, and then memorize it, and perform it just by memory.  Does he do it word for word, or is it close?  He didn't have teleprompters back then.  If it's the only song you sing, I don't think it's much of a problem.  Is that it?  Well, there was also Mr. Customs Man that he did at Woodstock.  That was a big Harlow Guthrie hit.  Yeah, that was absolutely huge, of course. 
[01:05:30]  Coming into Los Angeles.  Let's play.  Bringing in a couple of keys.  Let's play a little part of this.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Stop.  I hate it.  The guitar is a little sweet.  Let's say hi to Dexter in Indianapolis.  The show is spinning out of control.  What?  No, in a good way.  Dexter, what's up?  All right. 
[01:06:00]  Dexter?  He wants to know, when are you going to do something for the truckers?  We do.  We do something for the truckers every day.  We make you laugh.  That's right.  Oh, wow.  Here's Captain Obvious.  George from Colorado.  Go ahead, George.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, my wife works at the airport here in Denver, and she has to work today and tomorrow.  And she said yesterday, by the time she got off work, even the cops were ready to start  shooting the fucking travelers. 
[01:06:30]  They were so tired of them.  Sometimes me and my grandmother would have conversations with each other without ever  opening our mouths.  I agree.  And just so you boys know, it's going to be 70 degrees every day the rest of this week  while you're enjoying that cold snap over Thanksgiving.  I curse you, George.  I curse you.  Yeah, well, you know, my snowcat's parked in the garage, keeping warm still.  We came up with a great idea.  We want to be out of New York for the winter and still nothing on that one.  Go take a look at the snowcat, George. 
[01:07:00]  I got a surprise for you, George.  Go check it out.  Go check it out.  All right.  Back to Alice's Restaurant.  We will play the entire song by the end of this show today.  Maybe two minutes here, two minutes there.  What?  Let's go.  Ah, it is kind of happy, isn't it?  I've heard them.  I've heard them.  Jesus.  Forever. 
[01:07:30]  You would think with five pages of words, you'd get right into it.  Yeah.  You could have saved 30 seconds right here.  This poor shit.  This song is called Alice's Restaurant.  It's about Alice and the restaurant.  But Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant.  That's just the name of the song.  And that's why I call the song Alice's Restaurant. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Why is anyone laughing there?  There's no...  What?  Where's the...  What's the fucking goof in that one?  This song is called Alice's Restaurant.  It's about Alice and the restaurant.  But Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant.  It's just the name of the song.  And that's why I call the song Alice's Restaurant.  Hubble up, hudble up, hudble up, elbow, elbow.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  What a great audience that is.  Jesus Christ.  No kidding. 
[01:08:30]  Like that one.  Oh, my God.  Hi, how are you?  Bah!  I would kill in front of that audience.  Go ahead.  You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.  Walk right in.  It's around the back.  Just a half a mile from the railroad track. 
[01:09:00]  You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.  Real statement about the war.  That all started two Thanksgivings ago.  That's why.  Two years ago on Thanksgiving.  When my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the restaurant.  But Alice doesn't live in the restaurant.  She lives in the church nearby the restaurant in the Bell Tower.  Where their husband Ray and Fautch is a dog.  And living in the Bell Tower like that.  They got a lot of room downstairs where the pews used to be. 
[01:09:30]  And having all that room.  Seeing as how they took out all the pews.  They decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time.  We got up there.  We found all the garbage.  Huddle, huddle.  They're laughing?  They're laughing because there's so much garbage back downstairs.  Because they're filthy hippies.  By the way, we're only on the third paragraph.  Of the first of five pages.  Five pages of lyrics.  Full pages.  Full pages.  Not even spaced. 
[01:10:00]  You can't squish more lines on the paper.  No.  Right.  Having all the room.  Singing as how they took all the pews out.  They decided they didn't have to take out the garbage for a long time.  Hysterical.  You can live like a Puerto Rican if you live in Alice's Restaurant.  You can shoot your wife in the head and dump her at Alice's Restaurant. 
[01:10:30]  You can take out the pews and then have garbage smell which will make you go pew.  All right.  Creeps.  Two fucking creeps just fucking like they're just holed up in a church somewhere.  Yeah, living in the bell tower throwing their garbage downstairs.  Them in Noriega.  Let's say hi to Rich in New York.  Rich.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Rich.  In that last news clip, those people mentioned like, you know, their dog and whatnot.  Yeah.  Why the fuck do people take their dogs with them? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, because it's such a treat for the fucking family they're visiting.  To have a dog over their house.  Anyone who brings an animal over my house,  it's being staked out in the backyard on a six-inch chain.  Staked into the ground.  So its head is on the ground.  It's going, oh, oh.  Unless it's a puggle.  Then it gets all the leash it wants.  Comes in.  Sit on my couch.  You're going over to these people's houses to eat.  And you bring a dog.  You know what the best is?  When people bring like a big German Shepherd or St. Bernard to someone's house. 
[01:11:30]  And the dog wanders off.  And you're like, where's the dog?  And you walk in, and it's in the crib, giving the kid a mouthful of pink lips.  All right, fellas, why don't you know?  Yeah.  You better.  That's just all about selfish people bringing their dogs on vacation.  Hey, this in from Digger Dog from Whackbag.com. 
[01:12:00]  Ramone, Alice has AIDS.  This is just like the nervous ramblings of Steve.  Well, it all started a few Thanksgivings ago.  Well, it was two years ago on Thanksgiving.  Or something Ben would say.  Like as he's half asleep in the back of a car after you're finally out of the eight ball.  Oh, it's Alice's Restaurant.  But it's Alice.  It's not about the restaurant.  So it's not Alice's Restaurant.  It's the name of the restaurant.  That's why I called it the song Alice's Restaurant. 
[01:12:30]  Didn't get you two tickets.  Alice's Restaurant.  You can get whatever you need, except for maybe a comb.  They took all the pews out.  Now you two can play down there.  Robin Huntington, my fine hometown.  We had a shitty professor try and play this shit for one of my radio classes.  We laughed her stupid slimy sea ass for playing it.  And she turned it off after about two minutes.  The worst two minutes of my life.  And then Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  This show is called The Opie and Anthony Show.  But the show isn't named The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:13:00]  And they play awful fucking songs for awful fucking people.  And a little Jimmy P's in a cup.  I want to hear more songs.  What happened next?  They're in the place.  They're in the church.  All right.  We're in the church.  The pews used to be there.  They live in the bell tower.  They've thrown the garbage down into the church area.  This is Alice, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Silthy Alice.  That's right.  Who's handling your food.  Yeah.  Dirty thing.  Great job.  Oof.  You can catch this and Terry.  There's a new dump in town.  All right.  Let's hit it. 
[01:13:30]  There's a dog and living in the bell tower like that.  They got a lot of room downstairs where the pews used to be.  And we certainly don't have to recap.  All that room scene is how they took out all the pews.  We can take up right where we left off.  They didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time.  Huddle a huddle.  Here we are.  We got up there.  We found all the garbage.  And then we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city  dump.  So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW microbus, took shovels  and rakes and implements of destruction, headed on toward the city dump. 
[01:14:00]  Well, we got there and there's a big sign in a chain across the dump saying closed on Thanksgiving.  And then we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before.  Oh, I'm with that.  And with tears in our eyes, we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put  the garbage.  We didn't find one.  Oh.  Till we came to a side road.  Not the side of the side road was another 15-foot cliff. 
[01:14:30]  And at the bottom of the cliff was another pile of garbage.  We decided that one big pile is better than two little piles.  And rather than bring that one up, we decided to throw ours down.  That's what we are, right?  We drove back to the church, had a Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep,  and didn't get up until the next morning when we got a phone call from Officer Obie.  Obie.  Obie.  Obie.  I.  Said, kid, we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of garbage and 
[01:15:00]  just wanted to know if you had any information about it.  And I said, yes, sir, Officer Obie.  Cannot tell a lie.  I put that envelope under that garbage.  Ah, see?  It's really a lie.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh, they're just laughing and laughing. 
[01:15:30]  Holy.  By the way, still on the first page.  Yeah, I know.  Of five pages.  I cannot tell a lie.  I dropped the anchor and duct tape her and threw her off.  Threw her out of the fishing boat.  I wasn't doing no fishing, and it was a boat.  But I wasn't fishing, so, but it was still called a fishing boat.  Couldn't rightly call it a wife-killing boat.  Oh, this is terrific.  Well, we're going to have to say.  Cannot tell a lie.  The little one was in her womb, and I threw her overboard. 
[01:16:00]  He said, Mr. Peterson, I need you to come down here and pick up that pile of garbage.  And we went into the room, and there was an empty crib, and there used to be something that was supposed to be in the crib.  We blew a dust bunny out of the crib.  All right.  All right.  Well, we're going to stop there for now.  We're going to take a break.  We got Drew Boogie mixing for us today, remixing.  We got 15 minutes left on the song, and plenty of time left in the program. 
[01:16:30]  I want to hear a funny song, Opie.  Well, just remember where we're at.  The police found an envelope in the pile of garbage, and Arlo said that he put the envelope under the garbage.  Under that pile of garbage.  Do you know what's a funny song, though?  Huh?  I don't want us to forget this one.  What?  Because it's like a lot of big laughs.  Wow.  Big laughs.  Which one?  The Streak by Ray Stevens.  Oh, yeah.  There's a lot of laughs in this song.  Oh, my God.  I could even...  Oh, yes, they call it The Streak.  Look at that.  Look at that. 
[01:17:00]  He likes to show off his physique.  No, it's fastest thing on two feet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think they said that later.  Oh, okay.  I don't know what the order of.  Someone help us out on instant feedback.  We're trying to remember who did that song where they put all the clips in it.  The guy talks through it, and then there's clips of songs.  Dickie Freeman, or...  I don't know.  Someone can help us out with that.  What was the one song that was in...  And then at the end of The Streak, doesn't the woman, the old woman, Streaks...  What's her name?  I don't know.  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, yes, they call him Chris Reeve.  Ha!  You don't even bat an eye when you break his feet.  All right.  Why?  Yeah, why?  You did it.  I don't know.  All right.  Listen, uh...  I want to hear the...  We're going to go to break...  Streak.  ...with a little Thanksgiving stuff from Beavis and Butthead, and then Drew Boogie will mix  us out of here.  And then the Streak.  And we'll do some Streak when we get back.  And we got, uh, the headline of the day.  No one is beating this headline today in America. 
[01:18:00]  But we'll challenge you, America, and see if you got a better one in your paper.  But first, this.  Uh, I think we're supposed to talk about Thanksgiving and stuff now.  Oh, yeah.  You know, but, um, I always thought Thanksgiving was a time when you're supposed to sit at home  with your family and eat and watch TV and go to the bathroom and, um, so, um...  What are all these people doing outside?  Uh, I think they're all homeless.  Really?  All these people are homeless?  Wow.  You know, that sucks. 
[01:18:30]  Because, like, if they're homeless, why are they giving them a parade?  They should be giving them food and a place to stay.  A parade's not going to make them happy.  It's like, I'm starving and I'm homeless and I've got no money, but, oh, look, there's  a Garfield balloon.  Ah, that's very nice.  Oh, yeah, I feel great.  You know, it's just not right.  These people, they have nothing.  Dammit, Davis, what's your problem?  No, no, you know, it's like, it's like, I don't understand it.  It's like, how did these people get homeless anyways?  I mean, I mean, what went wrong?  Did they, like, lose their keys or something or did they just, like, forget, you know? 
[01:19:00]  No, dumbass.  They're all a bunch of lazy bums.  What?  Oh, oh, yeah, I see, yeah.  Bums?  I hope you enjoy your damn balloons.  You ought to be begging for those balloons.  Y'all just move along now.  Come on.  Go on home.  I mean, I mean, go on in the street.  Like, just burst and stuff.  I'm happy and day. 
[01:19:30]  I'm happy and day.  I love the yandere.  I love the yandere. 
[01:20:00]  I love the yandere. 
[01:20:30]  I love the yandere. 
[01:21:00]  I love the yandere.  Now, we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful bosoms.  Oh, yeah.  Did you know that Wow stickers have many other uses? 
[01:21:30]  I sliced out both my kidneys, and I patched up the wounds with Wow stickers.  But, but, dude, how do you pee?  Oh, boy.  Can't pee.  This was incredibly nearsighted.  Get your official Opie and Anthony Wow stickers at opieandanthony.com.  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Pee-pee-dance.  Pee-pee-dance.  Gotta go pee.  Opie and Anthony.  XM202.  Come and get it. 
[01:22:00]  Come and get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it. 
[01:22:30]  Get it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come and get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Get it.  Come and get it, man.  Come and get it.  Damn. 
[01:23:00]  Give it up for Drew Boogie, man.  That's good stuff.  The day before we take a few days off, we always get Drew Boogie in here to liven up the show.  On this, your getaway day.  It's getaway day, everybody.  We're gonna be doing traffic every ten minutes, Opie.  All right.  People out around the nation.  Traffic blows.  Yeah.  Coming into work, yeah, blows right about now.  It blows, okay?  No matter where you are.  We're gonna play Alice anymore.  No, we're gonna play every single second of Alice's Restaurant today. 
[01:23:30]  It's our tribute.  Piece by piece.  We found Mr. Jaws, by the way, Anthony.  Another song that was supposed to be funny.  I don't know this song.  You know this song.  These are songs.  This song.  They, for some reason, I don't know, was it the attitude back in the 70s or something?  That was, this was hysterical.  Radio stations played this multiple times a day.  Every radio station.  It was the rage.  People talked about it.  And laughed and laughed and laughed. 
[01:24:00]  What the hell were they thinking?  I don't know.  There's no relative comparison, that's why, because everything, like, on radio is probably  soft and cute and awful.  Well, no, this had something to do with Jaws Mania, though, too.  Jaws Mania, sweeping the nation.  Yeah, Jaws Mania was sweeping the nation, and so this song came out, and I guess we were  supposed to laugh and laugh.  Laugh.  That, the streak.  Another novelty, funny song.  Yeah, we found the streak.  But we should play Mr. Jaws first.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Because there's a lot of goodness in this song.  Now, what this guy did was he would talk and then ask questions like an interviewer, 
[01:24:30]  and then the answers would be popular songs from the time that was going on.  That was his gig.  That was his shtick.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, why don't we listen in here?  This was Jaws.  We are here on the beach where a giant shark has just eaten a girl's swimmer. 
[01:25:00]  Well, Mr. Jaws, how was it?  Die!  No way!  All right.  I don't think I'm going to make it through this.  I'm getting the douche chills.  I really don't think I'm going to be able to make it through this.  Wow.  All right, can we agree not to look at each other during this?  Because I'm really having a hard time.  That was pretty funny, though.  Shut up!  Chill.  Start it over. 
[01:25:30]  No!  I want to hear the J.J. thing, because he's, like, talking to him, but he's not really there.  All right, let's do that again.  Oh, no.  We are here on the beach where a giant shark has just eaten a girl's swimmer.  Well, Mr. Jaws, how was it?  Die!  Oh, man!  And what did she say when you grabbed her?  Please, Mr. Please.  I know sharks are stupid, but what did you think when you took that first bite?  How sweet it is. 
[01:26:00]  Mr. Jaws, before you swim out to sea, have you anything else to say?  I can't breathe in this.  I can't breathe in this.  What do you think so far?  All right, look, look, look.  It's funny.  I have to leave.  I have to leave the studio.  I cannot be in the same room as this song.  It's a funny song.  It's like the clips are, like, but they're not really there.  Shut up!  I smell bit.  No.  I am the greatest at smelling bits, and I smell bits.  Have you smelled one out? 
[01:26:30]  You're like a truffle-smelling pig.  I smell bit.  Bit.  Rifles around.  Bit.  I smell bit.  What are you sniffing out here?  We have very, very, very talented listeners out there.  And after a year and a few months, you'd think one of them would have called or sent something in.  I guess we just have to deal with the ones that do send things in. 
[01:27:00]  Yes, but I smell bit.  There's a lot of great things.  You want people to do this?  Yeah, there's a lot of great things that have happened on this program in the last year or so.  You've got to get the voice just right with Mr. Jaws.  Hey, Mr. Jaws.  And maybe tell a little story about the Opie and Anthony program.  We're here in the ONA studios.  Right.  And then use lyrics from songs.  From popular songs.  Popular songs.  Old songs.  I don't give a crap.  That's from a little movie called Helper Rascal 2005. 
[01:27:30]  I smell bit.  Jimmy, you're looking a little sick today.  Problem?  AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS.  AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  There you go.  There's a little starter for you.  A little starter kit.  We'll do a little starter kit for you.  But I smell bit.  That's pretty funny.  Can't we be friends?  That was the shark's answer.  Right.  But it was a popular song.  Yes, as I get up to choke you.  Shut up. 
[01:28:00]  Let's say hi to Lucky the Trucker.  Lucky.  Lucky.  You guys are killing me.  You're keeping me awake.  Hey, I was wondering how Dirty Dee Dee's handling all this traffic.  She's on XM traffic.  I'm punching out.  Big day for the traffic people.  Yeah, we're trying to get Dee Dee on the phone today because she's very busy with the  traffic reports.  But hey, is that Neil Diamond?  Yeah, Neil Diamond is on...  Love on the Rocks.  The early show.  Ain't no surprise.  Pour me a drink and I'll tell you some lies.  They come into America. 
[01:28:30]  All the dirty mud people.  We have to deal with them in America.  Filthy ragheads drive our cabs.  When we live in fucking America.  Our country tis of thee.  Today.  He puts the fucking...  What is that?  What is that, the one?  The Star Spangled Banner?  The, uh...  My Country Tis of Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty? 
[01:29:00]  Why Can't We Be Friends?  The ploof.  Why can't we be friends?  Why?  Because you're black and I'm white.  Traveling far.  Sorry, Drew.  I had to go there.  Notice I didn't look you in the eye, though.  Without a star.  Welfare.  We'll be sucking up welfare.  Yeah, they just want free.  Free everything.  Look at him.  He's looking good these days, isn't he? 
[01:29:30]  Look at Neil Diamond.  He looks terrific.  What song is he singing, I wonder?  Probably this.  We don't give a crap.  Oh, Opie, I like him.  We want to get back to Mr. Jaws, but I smell bit.  I know my...  Just imagine what the listeners will come up.  A little story and, uh, using, you know, clips of songs.  Clips of songs, uh, fantastic.  Absolutely.  It's an homage.  Hopefully we'll get some in very, very soon.  Let's, uh, let's go back to Mr. Jaws by Dick Goodman.  Oh, I have to do that?  All right.  It's funny.  With me now is the local sheriff.  Sheriff Brody, the shark will be back for lunch. 
[01:30:00]  What do you intend to do?  Do the dance.  Make the love.  No.  I want to get down tonight.  Just arriving is oceanographer Matt Hooper.  Sir, if someone is attacked by a shark, what should they do?  We are going aboard the fishing boat of Captain Quint.  Why would you do the hustle?  Captain, will you be able to catch this giant shark?  I will.  I will.  Oh.  Thank you, Captain.  Captain.  Captain.  Captain.  When you catch one of these sharks, what do you feel like? 
[01:30:30]  Like a rhinestone cowboy.  Why?  He just sighted the shark again.  He's coming straight for us.  Captain Quint is shouting something at him.  Hey, Jaws.  The captain says he's going to catch you.  What do you think of that?  Uh-oh.  Here he comes again.  They've hit him.  Mr. Jaws, why doesn't anything seem to hurt you?  He's coming right onto the boat. 
[01:31:00]  Mr. Jaws, why are you grabbing my hand?  Wouldn't you give your hand to a friend?  No, wait.  Mr. Jaws, that's not the way this record is supposed to end.  Help!  Help!  Oh, watered sound effect.  I cannot convey to you what a huge success hit that was.  That song was massive.  That thing, whatever it was. 
[01:31:30]  What year did that come out there, Hawk?  Let's look on the master computer.  And my Bruce Springsteen and Neil Diamond are not the same.  That's Scott.  You're being banned.  Yeah, just right now.  Ban him, Dan.  Good boy.  It doesn't matter what year it came out.  Why is, uh...  Mr. Jaws, why are you wearing a robe and coughing?  Ba-da-ba-da-bop.  Here's the story.  We could redo the original song, too.  Oh, I think we should. 
[01:32:00]  Make it a little fancier.  With the awful songs, all those songs that he played were hits of the day.  Those are all the big hit songs that were out when he was putting that together.  Wow.  Well, we'll see what the listeners come up with.  Do the hustle.  That's what you're going to do.  What are you going to do in a shark hump?  Do the hustle.  Because you've got no chance.  You might as well have a little fun.  Do the hustle.  Eh, sure.  All right.  Well, that was wonderful, huh?  I want to have some laughs, dude.  All right.  Hold on one second.  I need a funny song.  Here's a guy, Matt, from Florida. 
[01:32:30]  He guarantees he can beat our headline here in New York.  Oh, no.  Go ahead, Matt.  It just has to do with a taser and a naked man.  Oh, yep.  I read that one.  Yeah, what's the headline, though?  We're talking about headlines.  Yeah, the headline, naked man tasered in the genitals.  Yeah, naked man tasered in genitals.  That's a good headline.  Ouch.  It happened.  I emailed Steve the story.  It happened up about 20 miles from us, so.  Yeah, we got the audio, actually.  Let's listen in here.  Several people called 911 Saturday after seeing a man walking around the Holiday Inn on Fort Myers 
[01:33:00]  Beach totally nude.  Two women say Jeremy Miljor came up to them, asking them to touch him.  After they refused, one saw Miljor try to break into an apartment, smashing out a window.  When deputies arrived, they say Miljor became even more aggressive.  Deputy Daniel Hollywood pulled out his taser and fired it at him, with one of the probes  attaching to his genitals.  Despite the 50,000 volts, deputies say Miljor continued to attack them. 
[01:33:30]  What did he say?  It's electric.  Deputy Daniel Hollywood sent another 50,000 volts through the probe.  Miljor finally gave up, but then paramedics had to take him to the hospital to have the  probes removed.  Officer, what did you do?  Shock the monkey.  The thing I want to know is, what a bad dude are you when you fight with 50,000 volts  of electricity in your cock? 
[01:34:00]  You're bad, bad, Leroy Brown.  He has electricity in his cock crown.  Looks just like old King Kong.  Better than Patrice O'Neal.  Matt?  Yes, sir.  That's a good one.  All right.  Pleasure out, guys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Jesus.  That's a tough dude, man.  That's a good one.  Let's say hi to Lonnie in North Carolina. 
[01:34:30]  Lonnie.  Hey, how y'all doing?  Hey, boy and girl name.  How are you?  All right.  Hey, little Jimmy, I want you on this song, man.  I'm 38 years old, and I remember this song like it was played yesterday.  Wait, which song?  The Jaws song.  No, no.  Ant, remember.  I actually don't remember.  Yeah, I remember it from when I was a little kid growing up.  For me, it was The Streak.  For him, it was this one.  Yeah, The Streak.  Well, we can play The Streak as well.  Oh, well, they call it Too Many Laughs.  If you play The Streak now, Too Many Laughs. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember The Streak, too.  That was a pretty cool song.  I used to, dude, I swear to God, because I always wanted to be a performer, I used to  pretend I was singing it, because I thought it was funny.  You used to, dude, I really thought Ray Stevens was hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh...  I think my parents still have the, uh, album.  The little, the little, the little 45?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, all right.  Thank you, Lonnie.  Oh, there's Pat from Monaki.  Look, they're focusing on Pat, because he's like the, the real card here. 
[01:35:30]  What, uh, what are they eating today?  Oh, turkey?  As much turkey as they can?  And what, did he have a piece of turkey on his head?  Oh, my God.  We're getting this audio?  Is this on the media?  We're getting audio, right?  Well, I'm eating turkey.  Oh, my God.  He looks like a freak.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good, good.  No, actually, I'd like to see Pat on the other end. 
[01:36:00]  Let's say hi to Sonny Pirelli and No Filter Paul, teaming up today here in New York City  to do an assault on the media.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Good.  Well, uh, we just, CBS2 just spotted us and decided to kill their shots.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  They were, they were out there, and then there was some finger-pointing, and, uh, isn't that  the guy, blah, blah, blah?  Is this some guy?  Hold on a second.  I'm on the radio right now, buddy.  Hold on a second.  I'm on the radio.  Hold on. 
[01:36:30]  Jesus.  Your dormit is a fucking ass down here.  Yeah, he's the worst.  The fucking asshole.  He says, you can't be in a lobby on the phone.  What?  What a dick.  Fucking asshole.  All right, why don't you come up and tell the story, then?  Well, we need to send someone down to come get us, because we haven't got a call to come  in.  Absolutely not.  Yeah, thank you.  We'll see you in a minute.  All right, bye.  We'll send Mr. Jaws down there.  I guess Sonny Pirelli's checking out the show today, because he won one of the assault  on the media contests.  Great.  And, uh, he won two in a row, I guess, so he's checking out the show.  And No Filter Paul came in to say hi to him, and then they saw that there were live shots 
[01:37:00]  going on in New York City, so they ran out to try to do one, and they failed miserably.  Yeah.  All right, you want to hear the streak?  This one I used to think was really funny.  Of course.  We're now playing Disco Duck.  That was great.  You always playing through The Rapping Duke.  No, you got to draw the line somewhere.  The Rapping Duke.  That always made me laugh, too.  Disco, Disco Duck.  Yeah, I do remember that one.  Yes, I do.  It was in Saturday Night Fever, actually, when, uh, they walked in, when Tony Manero walked  into the, uh, dance rehearsal place, and all the old people were learning disco to Disco 
[01:37:30]  Duck.  Remember that one?  No.  Movie's great.  I want to hear Disco Chicken as it was sung in Germany.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, Mr. Motherfucker from Whackbag.com, what's up?  Uh, yeah, I got two headlines that might be able to top, uh, yours.  Okay.  There's, uh, one from the Tennessean, uh, Mull Freezeboro Man Freezes, uh, I believe it was  104 cats. 
[01:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What two of you didn't do 104.3?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And, uh, this one from, uh, the Northwestern in Oshkosh, it was, uh, Cleaver Case Back on  Track Teen Accused of Drowning Newborn.  Eh, eh.  That's more news, that's more informative.  Yeah, all right.  That's not intended to be clever.  I mean, it's, it's really funny.  All right, we're, we're, we're distracted.  I got nothing.  I'm bunched now.  I don't feel the Paul has arrived back at the, uh, studio.  All right, thanks, Mr. Motherfucker.  All right, later. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yes.  You want me to read the headline here in New York?  All right.  And then we'll get into Mr. Streak.  Okay.  Please.  We're all over the place today, but it's the day before Thanksgiving.  We don't really care.  Hope you're enjoying this.  The headline in New York, no one's gonna beat this in, uh, in the entire country today.  The headline reads, Priests must go three years gay free.  Gay free.  Three years, no cock.  For three years. 
[01:39:00]  That's a ruling?  That's the headline.  Priests must go three years gay free.  What, like, what, what's their, um, criteria for gay free?  Hey, no nuzzling?  Or do you have to have a cock in your ass?  And I'm wondering if they're gonna test them.  Yeah, how do you test that out?  Smell their, yeah, smell their breath.  You smile if there's a tadpole tail on your teeth.  You're probably guilty. 
[01:39:30]  Or they throw soap down if you immediately go to get it.  You're a fag.  Well, this is coming from the Vatican, Anthony.  Vatican City.  The Vatican says homosexuals who are sexually active or support gay culture are unwelcome in the priesthood  unless they have overcome their homosexual tendencies for at least three years.  Overcome.  They make it like it's one of them switches.  Do they have meetings?  Hi, I'm Father Frank and I'm a cocksucker.  Hi, Frank.  Hi, Frank. 
[01:40:00]  It's been three years and two months since I licked a helmet.  AA meetings for cock.  What's your story?  I came really close.  I saw a guy in a urinal.  I made the yummy noise.  But I called my sponsor.  From the 12-inch program?  Wow.  Well, this is the long-awaited document. 
[01:40:30]  It's scheduled to be released by the Vatican on November 29th  and was posted on the Internet yesterday by the Italian Catholic News Agency.  The document said that the church, while deeply respecting the people in question,  cannot admit to the seminary and the sacred orders those who practice homosexuality,  present deeply rooted homosexual tendencies, or support so-called gay culture.  Wow.  The document said that if candidates for the priesthood have only homosexual tendencies, 
[01:41:00]  such as in the case of an unfinished adolescence,  those tendencies must be clearly overcome for at least three years before ordination as a deacon.  So if you're jacking in bed with a friend, like Rich Voss told that story,  you've got to wait three years after that?  You've got to wait three years.  You've got to be gay-free for three years, and then they'll consider you for the priesthood.  Imagine if you get close. 
[01:41:30]  What happened?  I blew it.  No one's beating that headline today.  That's good.  That's the good one.  Head...  Yeah, get it.  Headline.  Headline, yeah.  All right.  What are we doing?  Where are we?  Streak.  All right, let's go back to the streak here.  You really liked this song growing up, Jimmy?  You're not kidding?  When I was very young, I would put on my laughing hat.  Oh, yeah.  And just, I really wished I was singing. 
[01:42:00]  I forget what parts I thought were, like, really cool.  Again, this was giant.  It was massive.  Another song that was massive.  It would be played every day.  You would hear it probably five times a day just in casual listening.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  My favorite part, though.  Any song with a wacky sound effect in it?  It's great.  Here it is.  Hello, everyone. 
[01:42:30]  This is your Action News reporter with all the news that is news across the nation on  the scene at the supermarket.  There seems to have been some disturbance here.  Pardon me, sir.  Did you see what happened?  Yeah, I did.  I was standing over there by the tomatoes, and here he come, running through the pole beans,  through the fruits and vegetables, naked as a jaybird.  And I hollered over to Ethelus.  Oh, apps.  Don't look, Ethel!  And it's too late.  She'd already been in since.  Here he comes.  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  There he goes.  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  And he ain't wearing no clothes. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, yes, they call him the street.  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  That's his thing on two feet.  That's his thing on two feet.  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  He's just as proud as he can be.  It's anatomy.  He's gonna give a safety.  He was the father of America's family, and now he has HIV.  Oh, yes, they call him Robert Reed.  Just can't get off his knees. 
[01:43:30]  And instead of, like, a wacky horn, you have, like, a family going...  His weight is down to 73.  It all comes back to that.  He said, where's my R-O-B-E?  Let's listen to a little more here. 
[01:44:00]  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad. 
[01:44:30]  Freaking around the grease right there.  Didn't have nothing on but a smile.  I looked in there, and Ethel was getting her a cold drink.  I hollered, don't look, Ethel!  And it's too late.  She'd already been mooned.  Flashed her right there in front of the shop and saw her.  He ain't rude.  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  He ain't rude.  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  He's just in the mood to ride in the news.  Oh, yes, they call him the street. 
[01:45:00]  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  He likes to turn the other cheek.  Boogie-dad, boogie-dad.  He's always making the news.  When did this finish you?  Guess you could call him the new name.  He's always making the news.  You know, it's run by the juice.  I'll try and have on that one.  Once again, your action news reporter in the booth at the gym. 
[01:45:30]  Horrible.  He's always making the disturbance at the basketball playoff.  Pardon me, sir.  Did you see what happened?  Yeah, I did.  Hey, Tom, I was just going down there to get Ethel a snow cone.  Here he come, right out of the cheap seat.  Dibble.  Right down the middle of the court.  Didn't have on nothing but a T.M.  Made a hook shot and got out through the confession stand.  I hollered up at Ethel.  I said, don't look, Ethel.  It was too late.  She'd already got a free shot. 
[01:46:00]  Grand second.  Ruff turned from the home table.  Well, it's a call in the street.  Here he comes.  Who's that whipping?  Ethel.  Is that you, Ethel?  What do you think you're doing?  You get your clothes off.  See, it gets really funny because now Ethel is streaking.  Ethel, where you go?  Ethel, you should be. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, man.  He put his cock in a bad place.  Now he's got sores on his face.  The streak is not nearly as bad as that Jaws song.  Equally as bad.  No, I say the streak is actually a good song.  Yeah, the Jaws song is definitely worse.  The streak is at least well-written.  Well-written.  Yeah, the lines are okay.  It's just, you know, outdated.  It is a little dated, isn't it?  A little bit.  Wasn't streaking all the rage? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, he likes to turn the other cheek.  A guy fucking runs naked through a grease pit.  You've got to respect that.  Guy's in a jiffy, a little whack in his bag.  He sees Ethel.  He's like, I want to show her my cock and balls.  What do you think of them, Apples, fella?  Fucking Ethel looks.  Ethel loved it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Wayne in Alaska.  Wayne.  Yeah.  Hey, Wayne.  How y'all doing, man?  Hello, Wayne.  We're all right, man.  What's up, Bobby and Anthony?  Hey, man.  What up?  Hey, sweetie.  Hello.  Good birthday.  Hi. 
[01:47:30]  Look at this guy.  Hey, boy.  What's up with the air in Alaska?  Oh, it's cold, man.  Cold.  Like 10 below.  10 below.  That's nothing.  That's what I was thinking myself a while ago.  If y'all was wanting to get out of the cold, I'd like to get out of the cold, too.  I'd be headed back down to the stateside for long.  Where are you from?  Juneau, Tennessee?  You don't sound Alaskan.  Texas.  I was born and raised in Texas.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  See, I'm good with that.  I pick up the accent.  I just want to tell you what a hell of a job y'all doing, man.  Y'all just funny as hell, man. 
[01:48:00]  Thank you, man.  Just funny as hell.  Thank you, man.  Y'all doing an excellent job.  And we care why.  Oh, man.  Thank you, Alaska.  All right, Alaska.  You're welcome, boys.  See you.  Y'all be good.  It's not every day we get a call from Alaska.  Thank you, Wayne.  What does he have to say?  Stone cold.  All right.  See you later, seal fucker.  You think the listeners will do that bit for us?  Of course they will.  I hope so.  That could be the new bit.  We haven't had a new bit for the listeners to really jump on in a while. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, no.  Say this is so helpful.  Let your clothes on.  Passes thing with flame shoes.  Hey, you guys want to go back to Alice's Restaurant?  Oh, yes.  They call him, Steve C.  Oh, I can't think of a small thing.  Fuck.  Where were we in the Alice's Restaurant song, Anthony?  We promised that we'd play a whole thing today.  Well, we had just told the officer that we had put the envelope under the pile of garbage. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, that's right.  That's where we were.  So...  Speaking of Officer Obi...  Right.  I cannot tell a lie.  I put that envelope under the garbage, right?  Yeah.  So he's about to get in a lot of trouble.  A lot of trouble with the law.  For littering?  Littering, yes.  Let's go back to Alice's Restaurant.  Okay.  After speaking over for about 45 minutes on the telephone, we finally arrived at the truth of the matter 
[01:49:30]  and said that we had to go down and pick up the garbage and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer's station.  So he got in the red VW microbus with the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the police officer's station.  Now, friends, there was only one or two things that Obi could have done at the police station.  And the first was that he could have given us a medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely.  But he's a stinking pig.  And the other thing was that he could have balled us out and told us never to be seen driving garbage around the vicinity again, which is what we expected. 
[01:50:00]  But when we got to the police officer's station, there was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon.  And we was both immediately arrested, handcuffed.  And I said, Obi, I don't think I can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on.  I said, shut up, kid.  Get in the back of the patrol car.  And that's what we did.  Sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the, quote, scene of the crime, unquote. 
[01:50:30]  I want to tell you about the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts.  Makes it funnier.  That's what is happening here.  They got three stop signs, two police officers and one police car.  But when we got to the scene of the crime, there was five police officers and three police cars.  Being the biggest crime of the last 50 years.  And everybody wanted to get in a newspaper story about it.  Did I mention they also had a yield sign?  Watch out for kids crossing the street sign. 
[01:51:00]  They had just painted the double yellow line on the street and the paint was still wet.  So we made sure we didn't drive upon it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  This song is another one that's just in real time.  Everything in real time.  I got out and walked and passed some faggot in a hybrid vehicle.  Oh, my God.  You can have all the honey and porn you want. 
[01:51:30]  Awful me from Wagbag.com checking in on the instant feedback.  Lots of comments coming in.  You can get anything you want at Alice's restaurant.  I want Alice to leave a hickey on my taint.  That song blows.  Very nice.  Should we play just a little bit more of this song?  All right.  Hit it, Eric.  Time of the last 50 years and everybody wanted to get in a newspaper story about it. 
[01:52:00]  And they was using up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hanging around the police officer station.  They was taking plaster, tire, track, footprints, dogs, snow and prints.  And they took 27, 8 by 10, covered glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us.  Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner and southwest corner.  And that's not to mention the aerial photography. 
[01:52:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Aerial photography.  After the war heel, we went back to the jail.  Opie said he was going to put us in the cell.  Opie said, kid, I'm going to put you in the cell.  I want your wallet and your belt.  That's a why.  Do I sing for in excess?  I said, Opie, I don't understand you want my wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell.  But what do you want my belt for?  And he said, kid, we don't want any hangings.  I said, Opie, did you think I was going to hang myself for littering? 
[01:53:00]  Opie said he was making sure, and friends, Opie was, because he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and ground.  And he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars, roll out, roll the toilet paper out the window, start down the roll and have an escape.  Opie was making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that Alice, remember Alice?  It's a song about Alice.  Alice came by and with a few nasty words to Opie on the side, bailed us out of jail.  And we went back to the church, had another Thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat and didn't get up until the next morning when we all had to go to court. 
[01:53:30]  Holy shit.  Can you believe that they play this?  We're only six minutes in.  We're a quarter of the way done.  Well, a third of the way done.  The guy that called in and you said you kind of enjoy this and it reminds you of Thanksgiving, I hope you choke to death five minutes into it.  If you went to a record company today and sang this horse shit to them, they would think you were insane.  By the way, that's only about halfway through the second of five pages. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, I know.  It just...  This is rambling, unpoignant dreck.  Dreck, very nice.  It's dreck.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, Professor Anthony, there was another awful parody song in the 70s.  It was called Eugene.  It was sung by this guy putting on an awful Italian guinea voice and the chorus was, I'm Eugene.  I'm a cool dude in a loose mood.  I don't remember that one.  He asked.  Please tell me you know it.  I know.  Shut up for your face.  That was...  Excuse me. 
[01:54:30]  I thought somebody...  Let me just make sure this didn't just happen.  For a minute there, I thought of Shut Up For Your Face, which is the type of song that just makes me want to fucking cut my own throat.  And then you said the name of the song, and I thought somebody in this room said the name of the artist without blinking.  I could be wrong.  Could it be possible?  Yeah, I knew it.  How did you know it?  I don't know.  Big song when you were working at PLJ?  No, he's not.  He hasn't made that three-year mark yet. 
[01:55:00]  Holy cow.  That qualifies.  That could keep you out of the church, sir.  Well, you got to start over.  Start over.  I just said Lil' Monty.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Do you have that?  Do you have Shut Up For Your Face?  Let's say hi to Mike in New Hampshire as E-Rock tries to find that.  Mike.  Mike A.  Oh, he had a good one, too.  Sometimes they get away.  Sometimes they just...  Look at the walking carpet.  This is torture, you lazy bastards. 
[01:55:30]  I'm not being lazy.  You play it, and you almost get hypnotized.  You know how many laughs we've given you so far today?  Yeah.  I say four.  Four, count them.  All right, what do we got?  It's not in there.  Why?  That's too bad.  It's not...  It's not in there.  I thought they had told us that every single song you could possibly imagine was in the  system at XM.  In the master computer?  Yeah.  Okay.  What was another one?  There were so many of those stupid fucking songs back then. 
[01:56:00]  Oh.  God.  I liked Rappin' Rodney myself.  That was a song that was fun.  Oh.  Pretty bad.  That was a good one.  Really bad.  Kidney-shaped pool with a stone in it.  Rodney.  I loved...  Oh.  Rodney.  I loved Rappin' Rodney.  I play him all right now, but last week I was in rough shape.  Oh.  So I don't get a break with nothing.  I played hide and seek when I was three.  No respect. 
[01:56:30]  No respect.  Why they wouldn't even look for me.  No respect.  No respect.  I was an ugly kid.  I never had fun.  No respect.  No respect.  They took me to a dog show, and I won.  No respect.  No respect.  When I was born, I brought no joy.  No respect.  No respect.  My old man said he wanted a boy.  No respect.  No respect.  I was an ugly kid, always alone.  No respect.  No respect.  Halloween, I had to trick-or-treat over the phone.  No respect. 
[01:57:00]  No respect.  Friends don't call.  My phone don't ring.  I don't get a break with anything.  What's the matter, Rodney?  Ah, death.  Where is my sting?  It's just rap and Rodney.  Ain't rap too tight, no.  Wow.  Rap and Rodney.  Get out of sight.  It's just rap and Rodney.  Make no mistake, whore old.  Rap and Rodney.  Can't get a break.  I put the pussy in its place.  And right before I'm not, I pull it out into the face and tell the bitch to keep sucking 
[01:57:30]  and prepare herself for her first butt fucking.  That's M.W.A.  Rodney does some fucking Ghetto Boys.  Oh, that was Ghetto Boys?  Same thing.  I'm sorry.  Same guys.  Yeah.  So I said washing machine door.  He's rap and Richard.  We should be rap and Richard.  We're just doing a show meeting live on the air today.  It's a barn-shaped pool with horse teeth in it. 
[01:58:00]  He's rap and Richard.  Rap and Richard.  No dignity.  No dignity.  Can you imagine?  Oh, hands like turtle feet.  He's...  Brand new jokes.  I only have a few.  I'm the only tattooed Jew. 
[01:58:30]  No respect.  That is awful.  That really is terrible.  Rap and Richard.  Rap and Richard.  What rhymes with 1978 BMW purchase?  Asshole you are.  Eugene might be by Crazy Joe and the Variable Speed Band.  I'm trying to find Eugene today.  What about the King Tut song?  Yeah, that was another one that was supposed to be funny. 
[01:59:00]  Oh.  Oh, it's that bad.  That's actually on my iPod because I uploaded the whole Steve Martin.  Yeah.  Some of his stuff is like mildly amusing in hindsight, but that shit does not hold up.  King Tut.  That whole fucking CD does not hold up.  You got it?  Oh.  But again, huge hit.  Cornball. 
[01:59:30]  Why?  Now, Willie was a young man.  He never thought he'd see.  Oh.  People stand in line to see the boy King.  He don't take that.  Oh.  How'd you get so funky?  Fucking good.  Ugh.  Did you do the monkey?  Oh, in Arizona.  Move to the Babylonian team.  This is horrid.  It's fucking awful.  Now, if I had known that line of Jacksonville, I'd take all my money. 
[02:00:00]  And bought me a museum.  Buried with a donkey.  What?  He's my favorite honking.  Born in Arizona.  Oh.  Move to the Babylonian team.  If you don't pause that, hawk, I'm going to kick your throat.  Dumb hawk.  He didn't pause the song. 
[02:00:30]  Got a mouth full of sneaker, King Hawk.  We could play the turkey song by Adam Sandler.  How'd you get so stupid?  Stupid hawk.  Fucking first of all, King Tut was not a honky, you irrelevant asshole with an owl to your  head.  He was black.  Oh.  Oh.  So fucking donkey doesn't rhyme.  Oh, man. 
[02:01:00]  That song is a...  It's embarrassingly bad.  And so does that whole stupid fucking almost biggest comedy album of all time CD.  Huge.  It's corny.  Huge.  All right, we're going to step aside and we'll get back to that.  Cat's handcuffs?  I bought a pair of cat's handcuffs.  We'll get back to...  Did you?  We'll get back to our little...  How'd a cat was misbehaving?  Was he?  Did you?  Really?  Dickie Goodman did a shitty Watergate song. 
[02:01:30]  Is there a Watergate song by him?  He...  In the same style as the Jaws song?  Yeah, I think it was the follow-up hit.  He did a couple of them, wasn't he?  Yeah, it was good, man.  It would be the first one.  What?  Mr. President?  I'm guessing, yeah.  Is it him?  It's him.  Well...  Let's give it a shot, Hawk.  It's gotta be, then.  Let's give it a whirl before we get our hair pulled.  Let me...  Let's see if it is.  Oh, you're...  What did you do?  Wow, you're tripping up.  What are you doing with your fucking...  Why did you have a band-aid on your finger? 
[02:02:00]  Did I cut my finger open?  Cut your finger doing what?  I don't know.  Besides not working.  Hurry up.  Get this off.  He's a stupid twat.  Balls have covered with icy hot.  E-Rock.  Stupid E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Hit it.  And now, for the news, we take you to the White House.  Mr. President, have you any statement regarding Watergate?  Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama.  How would you describe the Watergate incident?  Mr. President, what were you doing at the time the incident took place? 
[02:02:30]  And how do you feel about it now?  Here I am, stuck in the middle.  Mr. President, what will your position be from now on?  No more, Mr. Nice Guy.  No more, Mr. Glee.  This is 1973.  What will you be saying at election time in 1976?  It's been real all the years.  Do you still want me?  Do you want me?  Just arriving is the First Lady. 
[02:03:00]  How would you describe the President?  She's a free and gentle flower.  This is so bad.  With me now is John Snitchell.  And Mr. Snitchell, who do you believe was responsible for Watergate?  A single kid.  In a phone call, Mrs. Snitchell had this to say.  He's the first kid's world in the world.  Here with me is John Bean.  Sir, how do you think the President will wind up at the end of all this? 
[02:03:30]  Reeling in the east, stowing away the time.  This is even worse than the Jaws one.  What do you feel you have going in your favor?  I knew Jesus before he was a superstar.  Have you any final message for the American people?  This better be over.  What?  This record is not over.  The Vice President has just arrived.  Sir, can you tell us who will be the next President of the United States? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, no.  Not only that, he got everything wrong.  The worst part about that song, besides the devoid of humor aspect,  is that it was the follow-up, and he figured it would be hit number two. 
[02:04:30]  No, that had to be beforehand.  It was 73.  Oh, yeah, 73.  Jaws came out in like 76.  So someone said, that song is so good, we're going to allow you to make another one.  We're going to make another one.  Or unless he just put it after that and put 73.  No, because then he would have known that the Vice President, Spiro Wagner, never became  President.  Oh, you're right, you're right.  Okay.  Well, what's the guy's name?  Dick Goodman.  Dick Goodman.  I think he's dead, by the way.  Let's hope so.  And let's hope it was prostate cancer, which developed in his gums. 
[02:05:00]  What?  What?  Chester's Liver from WhackBag.com.  You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.  Can I get some broth to go?  I have to go walk my friend's poodle.  It won't be long now.  All right, we're going to do the old regroup.  The old regroup.  And we'll continue at the Opie and Anthony program.  Before we get to Drew Boogie, we got this wow line, Anthony.  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's working quite nicely around America. 
[02:05:30]  You get a wow sticker on your car.  And there are boobs out there, yes.  Well, there's ladies out there that will flash you if they see the wow on your truck or your car.  And then we got this little line that you could call and tell us about it.  Let's see what's going on on the wow line.  Wow across America.  Drew Tales from the Road.  Real people.  Real stories.  Real boobs.  I was about to lead old hopper tonight.  And this chick, she come up next to me and, oh, she had some big old hooters. 
[02:06:00]  It took two hands to hold them hooters up.  Hey, man.  I'm in Jamesville, Wisconsin.  And it's about 1130 at night.  I don't know what the fuck day it is, but...  My fucking car's got a wow sticker.  And this chick showed me her tits.  Fucking tits look like sandbags, dude.  This is brutal.  Driving across Missouri on our 70s.  I think this girl's got a wow sticker back there, but she had some tits.  And when she pulled them out of her, she was holding two hot taffy bars in her hand.  And it wasn't pretty, but hey, it's just tits. 
[02:06:30]  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony wow line.  866-WOW-ME-05.  And if you need a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  Very proud of my big tits.  Yes, suck it. 
[02:07:00]  Yes, suck it.  Are you very naughty?  Are you very naughty?  Are you very naughty?  Yes. 
[02:07:30]  Get it in my mouth.  Get it in my mouth. 
[02:08:00]  Are you very naughty?  Suck, suck, suck it.  Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck it.  Are you very naughty?  Naughty.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  How can I honestly say anybody rips me off?  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it. 
[02:08:30]  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right, well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean, I know you...  I know.  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever. 
[02:09:00]  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars.  Jumping, grabbing.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore. 
[02:09:30]  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I did it all.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine.  I already did it.  He killed himself, Robin.  Right.  I've done it all.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything. 
[02:10:00]  Crap.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the, what was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard. 
[02:10:30]  And what were we supposed to do if you saw, like, I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a butt, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called a fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention. 
[02:11:00]  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Ooh, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  That was me.  Robin and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  The only one in the show.  XM 202. 
[02:11:30]  It was you.  He's kicking the stars.  Could you have fallen?  The onlyOoh 3.  But you don't care.  That's what I made.  Don't matter with you.  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Ah, you've got to love that. Drew Boogie in-house today, helping us out.  We're kind of screwing off the day before Thanksgiving. 
[02:12:30]  Of course, making it up as we go along.  Let's say hi to Justin in Washington. Justin.  Hi.  Hey, Justin. Fairly hear him.  Justin?  Yeah?  What's up?  Not much, just thought and said. Love your show. Hope you guys keep it up.  We'll try.  Well, we're planning on not keeping it up, actually.  How long have you been listening, Justin?  We're just going to give up.  About five months.  Oh, cool, man. Where are you from?  Ellensburg.  Oh, yeah. What's the best bit you've heard on our show since listening to us? 
[02:13:00]  Wait, wait. Before you ask about Justin, Justin, let me ask, seriously. Are you still, right?  Yeah.  And then, um...  Wow. A gassy young man.  All right, Justin.  Yeah?  How many minutes you got on your cell phone?  I don't know. I haven't looked yet.  All right.  I'm not worried.  All right. Thank you, sir. 
[02:13:30]  It was a wonderful phone call. Thank you.  Okay. I guess the best part was you guys' bit about the JetBlue. Making fun about that.  Actually, we were wasting time. We really didn't care. I was just setting up the Jim Norton fart.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And, um, I, uh, I'm telling people that I'm kind of hooked on MySpace, and I met a girl yesterday from MySpace.  Oh, really, Jimmy?  Yes.  And?  She was nice. We didn't hook up, but we just kind of hung out, but we, um, she thought,  I swear to God, she was 19, and she's like, um, how old are you? I'm like, well, how old 
[02:14:00]  do you think I am? And she's like, 22? She thought I was 22, and she thought I was 5'10".  What?  What?  I don't know. I don't know. I was like, what are you thinking? I was like looking for a dog  to pet.  I don't lie. I don't lie. I mean, that says I'm 37, but she thought I was 22.  That's something. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  That's the whole story.  All right.  We didn't even kiss. No smooching.  Are we gonna, we're gonna bail on the rest of, uh, Alice's Restaurant, right?  Of course.  No, we're not.  Yes, we are.  I'm gonna fight for this.  We've proven.  I want more Alice's Restaurant.  We barely made it to page two, and we just can't, we just can't do it.  I want some Alice's Restaurant laughs.  We have proven it stinks.  It goes on and on and on and on.  How about the chorus? Can we hear the chorus?  I don't think they're, it ever gets to the chorus.  It does, it did it already.  Yeah, at the beginning of the song, right? 
[02:15:00]  No, Jimmy.  No.  This song does suck.  Kids and villagers and me and a litter bugger.  Right.  But they'll be playing it tomorrow.  Q1043 should be fucking firebombed for playing this.  Can they not be predictable?  How about going, that song blows, we're not playing it.  Shut up.  That's why satellite radio is so cool.  Oh, you're right.  We're unpredictable.  I think Elo's giving his own channel to Alice's Restaurant.  They should play it once for the whole year.  And when it finishes, they'll change it.  Get it?  Long song. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  All right, we got the husband.  He spoke on morning TV.  The husband of the hottie?  The hottie, the Christina Applegate teacher that was fucking the 14-year-old.  I was just gonna say that.  Here's the audio.  So hot for the kids.  Why would you show your face?  He wasn't getting the job coming home.  All right.  Do you think she's at risk to offend again? 
[02:16:00]  You know, I don't know that she is.  And I, you know, now that she can't teach, I don't know that she'll have an opportunity  to have contact with, you know, younger children.  So, yeah, I'm not really sure.  Her lawyers were planning an insanity defense.  Was she insane at the time?  No, she wasn't insane.  I mean, she had some mental problems she was being treated for.  But, you know, insane.  What a lawyer.  Player off as the lunatic.  That's good.  She had some mental problems.  Is that her husband?  I'm just trying to be a nice fucking guy here.  Marry the fucking retard.  And she goes fucking kids on me.  No, this guy is covering his own ass. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah?  Because everyone's looking at him like, man, dude, what's wrong with you that you couldn't  keep this one satisfied?  Turn your friggin' hot wife to 14-year-old boys.  I want to just, I think this is the way the audio should have gone.  Can we just play the reporter's question?  So I can put one question for the reporter.  Right?  I'll be him.  How far back do I have to go?  Oh, no, no.  No, I'll be no.  Whatever one you want to.  The last question.  No!  The last question?  Dude, who am I?  All right, I'll try.  I don't know.  I'll just...  I'm him, and I'm on the Today Show. 
[02:17:00]  All right, get ready.  You know, younger children.  It's fucking well, it's my turn.  Her lawyers were planning an insanity defense.  Was she insane?  She's a cunt!  She's a cunt!  A cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt!  I hope she dies.  Cunt!  Thank you, sir.  That's all he should say on television.  It's all I'd say.  Well, now I gotta back up.  Maybe I'll stop it again. 
[02:17:30]  You never know.  I'm sorry, I'm not really sure.  Her lawyers were planning an insanity defense.  Was she insane?  She's a baby fucker!  She embarrassed me in front of everybody.  Cunt!  All I did was love her and buy her things, and she fucks a child.  Yeah, let me hear that question one more time.  Sure, sure, sure.  All right.  Sure.  Her lawyers were planning an insanity defense.  Was she insane?  Everybody, everybody, let's get into it.  Get stoopy, get retarded. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, I'm doing a, uh...  Let's get retarded, let's get retarded in here.  Oh, here's what, uh...  Uh, should I go back?  No, no, no, because the question, I have to rephrase the question.  Yeah.  Uh, why do you think there was a child fucking, uh...  Banana!  Hey!  Hey!  Banana!  The comment from the judge.  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[02:18:30]  Sure.  Her lawyers were planning an insanity defense.  Was she insane at the time?  No, she wasn't insane.  I mean, she had some mental problems she was being treated for.  Um, but, you know, insane, I mean, it's such a strong word,  and I seriously doubt that she was.  She was the greatest freak of the best I've ever had,  and I've heard him all over the world.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!  Seriously doubt that she was. 
[02:19:00]  But you feel that she does need some serious psychiatric counseling.  Liar, whore! Liar, whore! You know it!  The thing that bugs you about this guy is that he sounds like Lieutenant Dan.  He really does.  She was fucking a, fucking a child, Gump.  This guy really bugs me.  She does need some serious psychiatric counseling.  I think she needs some intense psychiatric counseling,  and, in fact, you know, the judge ordered her to receive some counseling, 
[02:19:30]  so I think it's good for her.  What are you feeling for her at this point?  You know, I think she's been given a second opportunity,  and I think she needs to make the best of it.  I don't hold any ill will towards her.  I've tried to put that behind me and just move on with my life.  She apologized to the boys' family in court yesterday,  and she took responsibility for her actions,  but one couldn't help but notice that she did smile several times in the courtroom.  Do you think she understands the gravity of what she's done?  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore.  You can get a doggie started.  You can get a lean on your side. 
[02:20:00]  Those are your only choices.  It's my house, and I get the same.  Why'd she laugh?  I'll bet you when she saw the boys, she said,  Here I am, you lucky people.  I don't think she does,  and I think, you know, time and time again in conversations I had after her arrest,  I don't think she can make the distinction of how wrong it really is  to have a sexual relationship with a child,  and that's one of the things that's most disturbing to me.  Well, I understand that this has been tough for you,  and we do wish you well,  and thanks for joining us this morning.  Thank you.  It's Owen LeFave.  Nutty as a food cake.  God, he's had discussions with her, 
[02:20:30]  and she's like,  I just don't see the problem.  Goddamn rich cunt!  Oh, that's Jeff Goldblum.  Yeah.  Goddamn rich cunt!  Yeah.  In his best role in Death Wish.  Death Wish.  Just saw it recently.  Yeah.  Very bad movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, so dated.  I think so.  Fun to watch,  but let's go to John in Ohio.  John?  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  I was listening to this thinking,  a woman got that screwed up perv switch, too.  Imagine, she's a kid 14 years old, 
[02:21:00]  she's teaching in a school.  Kid that age got no control, right?  Wind blows.  Little pecker gets hard.  Maybe this 14-year-old kid is hung like a horse,  and she just had to have some of that.  I think that was it.  She's, like, leaning over, going,  now, what you do,  no, you've got to carry the two over here.  Let me show you.  You carry the two.  Now, go to the next number,  and then,  I've got to suck that cock.  I need that cock. 
[02:21:30]  Let's go to Lewis in North Carolina.  Lewis.  Yeah.  I was wondering,  the guy who was fucking the teacher,  I wonder what the 14-year-old girls think of him.  Does he have,  you know what I'm saying,  he's possibly really on the want list  for these 14-year-old girls,  because he's got some experience now,  or do you think they shun him?  Yeah, probably.  He's got that street cred,  and I think the girls are scared shitless of him.  You think so?  Yeah, they can't compete with a hot teacher.  Yeah, that's probably it.  They've got their little nubs,  and their braces, 
[02:22:00]  and their pigtails.  He probably wants to get laid now,  poor guy.  Got some audio from the husband again.  Yeah.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let me see if I have audio. 
[02:22:30]  And when asked what the husband thinks of the kid,  he stinks,  and I don't like him.  Wow.  Harsh words.  I got audio, Anthony, of this guy's friends giving him a talking to behind closed doors.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  And this is the husband talking about what she did, you know, how it affected him and the family, his family.  You look like assholes right now, man. 
[02:23:00]  Hello, exactly.  I got more audio of one of his friends giving him a talking to.  You blew it!  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism.  Happens every time one of those dancers start poontanging around with those show folk fads.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess he got alone with the kid for a couple of minutes and had a little talking to him.  Oh, yeah?  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  It's hard to get these clips.  It's amazing you guys got them.  Yeah.  None of the news.  Exclusive, kind of.  Well, that's what you could do, because it's satellite radio.  These clips are a little saucy.  Saucy.  Let's see.  Yeah.  At first, I think the kid was not really into it.  People keep your hands off of my mule. 
[02:24:00]  That should sound very old, though.  No.  Pretty mature for his age.  I got an exclusive audio of the husband when he found out that his hot piece of ass wife  was having sex with underage boys, Anthony.  Good work.  And the judge really gave her a light sentence and seemed to be taken with her beauty, and 
[02:24:30]  I think that is why the judge had this statement.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  I'm not.  I'm not a machine.  I'm not a machine.  Let's see.  This is when he was asked if he wanted to have sex with her.  Okay.  Yeah, there's two clips here.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to play the right one, but I think we have actual audio  of the kid as he's trying to have sex with the hot teacher. 
[02:25:00]  Wow.  Mom!  I'm not going to order.  I have to do this now.  Very important.  And I didn't know this, but the hot chick actually spoke with the 15-year-old cousin  that ratted him out.  Sure.  Wait, I forget.  What did the husband say when he found out again?  When he found out his wife was having sex?  We already heard it, but I forgot.  And this was playing in his head as she was telling him, the husband. 
[02:25:30]  And here's the kid driving in the van.  Hey, everybody!  We're all going to get laid!  Well, you know, the husband came out of his house, Anthony, after hearing the news.  Oh, really?  And, well, he saw the story on TV and sort of the whole neighborhood, and I think we got 
[02:26:00]  audio of one of the neighbors as the husband left his house.  Yeah.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Kid got a little ballsy there after a few times.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Wow!  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 hole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ma! 
[02:26:30]  Please!  Stop calling me!  He really wanted to get some.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  Oh, this is bad, because this was when it was all over.  Yeah.  When this came to the door.  I'm Detective John Kimball!  Yeah.  I'm a police officer.  Ah, the fun's over.  Fun's over.  Yeah.  Fun's over for everybody.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Oh, no.  Pushing buttons.  It looks fun.  And then, uh...  Yeah.  The husband.  Oh, dear Lord.  Jesus. 
[02:27:00]  This ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This isn't happening.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's great.  This is fucking great, man.  Now, what the fuck are we supposed to do?  We're some real pretty shit now, man.  Yeah.  And we found one gentleman in the neighborhood that just didn't find this story hot whatsoever.  No?  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  And, uh, I guess she asked the kid, uh, if he wanted a blow job. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Wait, what was that one?  I didn't quite hear his response.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who are you?  Looks like the kid was taking his time in that van or car, Anthony.  Really?  She's naked and she just wants a good banging.  Mm-hmm.  Got audio of the teacher here.  Just do it!  She changed her voice there.  Yeah, a little bit. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, you sure that wasn't the clip of the boy when he had his penis out and you wanted  her to suck it?  It's amazing how she had to say that.  No, I got two just do it.  One is female, one's male.  I hit the wrong one there because I'm at Alice's restaurant having some...  All right, shut up.  All right.  Well, I guess that does it for the audio, huh?  It is?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe...  Let me see.  I like...  These machines look fun.  No, there's a lot of news clips on the AP here. 
[02:28:30]  No, I know.  Really?  Yeah, we're just trying to go through all of them.  This is all audio.  It's hard to get.  It's all newly released.  It's fresh.  Of course, it's fresh.  Yeah.  Some embarrassing testimony for the chick, the hot chick on the stand.  The first thing the guy said to her, the little kid, when she first took her pants  down.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  We got the bit checking in on the phone line, Anthony. 
[02:29:00]  The bit is checking in on the phone line.  The bit is on the phone.  All right.  Yes, bit.  Yeah.  You guys are fucking killing me.  Can you punch out to him?  Are you trying to say...  All right.  He's gone.  All right.  I think he's saying that he's being run into the ground.  Yeah.  Ah.  You will be molested.  Yes.  All right.  I guess that's about it, huh?  I don't have a...  You know what, guys? 
[02:29:30]  Since I don't have buttons to push, here's what the kid said when he first saw the woman  naked.  Hey, he shit himself.  That's my button.  Do you ever suck a guy's cock?  All right.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  It's the last time I'm going to ask you.  Let's go to Michelle and...  Actually, Michelle.  Michelle, New York.  What's up?  Michelle.  Hello.  I can't hear.  Holy shit.  Hi.  Oh, Petter, you're on the phone, Peter.  Sorry.  I told you.  My ears are ringing from the U2 show. 
[02:30:00]  I can't hear myself think.  Michelle, that's nice oppie.  I'm sorry, Michelle.  What's up?  Well, I wanted to talk to Jimmy.  I met you last Friday in LA after the Lucky Louie taping.  Yes.  You stared at my boobs when my fiance took my picture with you.  Remember?  Oh, what's your name?  Michelle, okay.  Where are you guys from?  Buffalo.  Okay.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'm glad you remember me.  No, I do.  I wasn't sure because there was somebody from Modesta that came too, believe it or not.  By the way, I want to let you know, I'm a celebrity stalker myself, so it was really 
[02:30:30]  cool that you let me take the picture a hundred times because we couldn't get it right.  You're welcome.  Yeah, that was cool.  Anyway.  That was because you were hot.  What's that?  That was because you were hot.  Yeah, send me a copy of the pic of me looking at your bosoms.  Okay.  If you're fat, you get one shot at it.  Not even if I'm walking away, I wave at you.  Right.  How are you?  How do?  That's how it works in the entertainment biz.  If you're attractive, you get a picture.  If you're a big fatty with leg warmers on, I give you a little salute like Radar leaving  mash through the door.  I salute you through the glass. 
[02:31:00]  You better have a nice lens on that camera because I'm out of here.  My fiance, he was a little nervous.  You were starting to like him a little bit too much too.  Oh, is he a good boy?  He's a good boy.  He's a big boy.  All right.  Anyway, I wanted to know how you feel about getting the largest applause and having the  largest fan base out of anyone else in that show, including the star of the show, Louie.  I mean, everybody loved you and nobody else really got an applause.  Well, that's when you first walk out.  I mean, what happens is a lot of people aren't as familiar with the show yet because it's just 
[02:31:30]  getting underway.  No, this was in the beginning of the show when they were announcing your name.  That's what I'm talking about.  So what I'm saying is that when the characters come out, people have only seen the pilot.  So any Opie and Anthony fans kind of give me an applause because they know me.  I have a history with them and a lot of the other actors don't have a history yet.  But once the show's on the air, that will change.  That's what I'm saying.  You're not even the star of the show and you got the biggest one.  But you know what?  That was the one show you were at.  Other times they have to watch the pilot.  Mike Haggerty gets the biggest applause or Louie.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Michelle.  Bye, Michelle.  Thanks, guys.  There just happened to be a lot of ONA fans with the one she was at. 
[02:32:00]  Jimmy, how is that going out there in LA?  Yes.  Oh, we're very happy.  Shut up.  No one cares.  But Opie, I'm going to answer.  Sheepers.  I'm going to tell you.  Let's go to Bill in Florida.  He has a problem with the last bit.  I think a lot of people have a problem with the last bit.  Why?  What's wrong with the Alice's Restaurant of clips?  Bill.  Hey.  Bill in Florida.  Hello?  Damn it.  He knows the kid and this is just plain wrong.  Oh, well, that's always.  He's lying.  Of course he is.  Stop it. 
[02:32:30]  He doesn't know the kid and it's not wrong.  You're 0 for 2, Bill.  We actually have the actual audio of the husband and his statement in court.  Really?  Yes.  I want to apologize to the court.  To the young...  Oh, they said it was the husband.  This is the hot teacher.  This is her statement in court.  Why would he apologize?  She had to apologize to the victims.  I want to apologize to the court, to the young man involved and to his family for my actions.  I accept full responsibility for my actions and I am very sorry for everything which has occurred. 
[02:33:00]  And look for me and Playboy in 2006.  Can't.  It's in part of the agreement.  Why?  Part of the agreement.  She can't pose nude in any of those.  Really?  Yeah.  She's a sex offender.  I don't know.  Sex offenders posing nude.  It's part of the plea agreement.  Because she's probably getting offers like crazy to be in Nudie Magazine.  Wait.  Forever she can't?  I don't know.  Forever.  But for the time, that probably really counts. 
[02:33:30]  Like right now.  Yeah.  You can't profit off your crimes either.  It's technically...  Would it be?  Yes.  I think you say no, but believe me.  Yeah.  You talk to the judge.  Am I right or wrong, guys?  You're right there, Jimmy.  I think you're right.  Hey, speaking of sex offenders, would you like to play the sex offender game today?  No.  I don't think that type of stuff is funny.  I love it.  Alright.  Would you like to play?  Sure would.  Yeah.  Alright.  Um...  Am I the host again?  Yes, you are.  Alright. 
[02:34:00]  I gotta get the answers from Danny.  We'll take a break and we'll play the sex offender game next.  I love the sex offender game.  We should play something going into break here.  Oh!  Hold on, Danny.  There's a lot of stuff in front of us that we're trying to get through before we take  a couple days off for the holiday.  Someone made a Team America O&A parody.  Uh oh.  This has little legs.  Well, we...  We didn't like it at first and then it kinda grows on ya.  Yeah.  Yeah?  You know the old...  The Team America Fuck Yeah song? 
[02:34:30]  Uh huh.  Right?  Yeah.  Well, someone made a O&A version.  What is this Wii shit?  It grew on us.  Me and Oprah.  We didn't like it at first.  It was in...  We played it in the studio for a couple minutes.  I don't know where you are.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  You were late getting into the studio as we were setting up.  I was?  So I was playing this and Jimmy and I were like, ugh.  And then we were like, huh?  It stunk and then it stunk less.  It's not that bad.  It stunk and then it stunk less.  Come on. 
[02:35:00]  O&B and Anthony.  Holy fuck yeah.  Only radio starts your motherfucking day.  Holy fuck yeah.  XM is the only way.  Same radio you're gaining through.  Cause now you'll have to answer to.  Holy fuck yeah.  So shit on Jimmy's chest and tickles my balls.  Only.  Fuck yeah.  On XM 202. 
[02:35:30]  So fuck you.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Today they're on the air.  Cause it might not be tomorrow.  Fuck yeah.  Wow.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah. 
[02:36:00]  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah, fuck yeah  Oh, fuck yeah  Fuck yeah  Joker  Fuck yeah  Fuck yeah  Mouth trap  Fuck yeah  Fuck yeah 
[02:36:30]  Mind a rock  Fuck yeah  Rambo  Fuck yeah  Fuck yeah  Fuck yeah  Alright, his voice is a little wacky, which is kind of funny.  It's hard to understand some of the lyrics in the beginning. 
[02:37:00]  We appreciate the effort.  I like it.  Now die.  Not bad, bad or anything, but...  That was alright.  I like it.  We appreciate the effort.  Yeah.  Or contact us again.  Lose that, please.  Thanks a lot for thinking of us.  Lose your subscription.  Wow.  Awful Me from whackbag.com talking about that last bit, which I thought was kind of cute.  Let's give Awful Me a day in court.  He writes on the instant feedback, Ramon, get this bit of robe and some bra. 
[02:37:30]  It wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  We had to think quick on our feet there.  I'll tell you one thing.  Even though those guys were cool yesterday, good old S from Y would have had a ball with  NXS.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little phone call.  How many lines in would Ramon bring me a belt?  Yeah.  Bring me a belt.  It's brave to talk about now. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, dude, I'm pleased.  Not that they're not in the studio.  Oh, you're preaching to the choir.  All right.  Oh.  All right.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  Pick that up.  Yeah.  Yeah, we should play the Brother Joe sea song there.  Really?  It's mean-spirited.  In honor of the hot teacher.  I think we should send this one out to the husband that got screwed over royally.  Mm-hmm.  He lost his piece of ass wife.  And Brother Joe has a fine, fine song about women, I guess.  Yeah.  That have done you wrong.  C is for the way you crap on me. 
[02:38:30]  You is cause you're ugly.  And so's your peach.  And for no, I never told you that I railed your sister.  T, thanks for the Hummers.  They were better than your mothers. 
[02:39:00]  Cunt is all you'll ever be.  It's true.  Cunt, you must be more than one or two.  You, your gas is stanky.  And your ass is always cranky.  Cunt, the word was made for you.  Cunt is for castration.  Cunt is for castration.  Cunt is for castration. 
[02:39:30]  Tried that on me.  Hey, hey, you.  Well, I urinated.  Have a shot, it's free.  And for some big negro tearing up your leather cheerio.  T, you friggin' twat.  No, you will never be forgotten.  Cunt is all you've ever been to me.  A cunt, and a really big one. 
[02:40:00]  And all my friends are green.  You're that slang word for vagina.  Can't describe you any finer.  Cunt, the word's just right for you.  Cunt, the word was made for you.  Cunt, the word was made for you.  All right.  We were going to take a break, but Club Soda Kenny's on the line. 
[02:40:30]  He has urgent news.  He wants to talk to us live on the show.  Yes, Kenny, what's up?  Kenny?  Good morning to three, everybody of my favorite people.  Hi.  Hi, Kenny.  Listen, I've got to talk in code about something.  Is that all right?  Yes, yes.  Go ahead.  You know that place I can't go to?  Yeah, Kenny can't go to CES in Vegas.  Which is ridiculous, by the way.  It was a college.  It's completely ridiculous, because I told him to do something last year, and it was terrific. 
[02:41:00]  It blew up in our face, and now there are people in Washington that just don't like Kenny,  because I told Kenny to do this.  Really?  Even though the company that he did it to has been doing everything they can to undercut XM  and other shit, like picking up the Hammerstein show.  And it's not even a deal like someone's going to see Kenny, and there's going to be a problem.  No one remembers last year.  Just fuck it.  He was just obeying orders, and I thought it was a good idea.  And he should just be there. 
[02:41:30]  Because we're just trying to make that company's life a living hell.  That's all.  And I didn't understand, because we attacked Howard Stern's press conference, so I thought  this was in line with everything else we've done.  Yeah.  But I guess it wasn't, and it caused a major problem, and now, unfortunately, there are  people that don't like Kenny, which kind of sucks, because Kenny's great for us in this  radio show.  Yep.  We're working through it, though, Kenny.  Well, I'll probably perpetuate that propensity that they don't like me, because I found some 
[02:42:00]  And I gotta say, I had a phone call with Don the other night, and Don's like, you know,  I gotta tell you, I'm okay with Kenny going to Vegas.  I'm like, really?  You're okay with that?  That's your decision?  You're okay with Kenny going to Vegas?  It's not your decision.  And then he goes, whether you told him to do that last year, or that he did it on his  own, and I lost my mind.  I said, Don, everyone in the company knows at this point that I told Kenny to do it.  And it blew up in our face.  And now Kenny has to suffer.  And now we have to suffer, because now we don't get Kenny on the road. 
[02:42:30]  And Kenny is the best on the road.  Without a doubt.  Kenny takes care of, he coddles you.  It's great.  So I want to make it perfectly clear.  I told Kenny to do that last year.  Trip will not be as gooder without Kenny.  And I got in some deep, deep trouble over it.  So...  I appreciate you taking the heat from me.  But go ahead, Kenny.  Well, I found some non-stop first-class airfare from Newark to Las Vegas on America West 
[02:43:00]  Airline.  Is that acceptable?  Woof.  Why?  Didn't Greyhound have any left?  America West, huh?  America West?  Yeah.  That's cool.  First class.  That's nice.  Your last flight should be a comfortable one.  America West is a partner airline of Continental.  They may be where they were at one point.  I don't even know if they still are.  Yeah.  But they're still shit.  And you're actually allowed to sit in the cockpit and talk to the captain. 
[02:43:30]  It's an awful airline.  Well, I tried to do the best I can.  Aww.  I always ever do.  No one's ever yelling at you.  Wow, Kenny.  What did you do?  You got like four seats?  For me and Opie and our girls?  How about five?  And Jimmy?  Yeah.  How many seats did you get?  I could only get three at this point, but I'm working on more.  Oh, so three would have been who?  Well, truth be told, I had four, and as the travel agent was entering the reservations, 
[02:44:00]  we lost one.  Yeah.  So who would the three would have been that you would have gotten these seats for, Kenny?  Well, originally when it was four...  No, I understand when it was four, but three, you just called up with three.  Right.  You didn't have four when you just called.  So who were the three?  Yeah, we want to listen to this.  Who's going?  Well, I'm offering it out there to anybody that wants it.  That's how Ben said it. 
[02:44:30]  We know exactly who it would have been if everybody would have accepted Opie, Lindsey, and Jimmy.  Well, the thing is, Opie asked me to look into it.  Yeah, I gave him a personal request.  I will fly with my pal, Anthony.  I'm teasing.  I am teasing, of course, Kenny.  And you know it wouldn't have been Jimmy, because Jimmy would not get on America West  ever.  See, these are the little things that Kenny does for us.  You know, I hate flying, I hate layovers, and it's just one of my things that I have  to deal with. 
[02:45:00]  And they had us flying on such an old airline.  It was the same airline that I was telling you guys about recently, where they have in  the bathroom a place to put your cigarettes out.  And razor blades.  And a place to dispose of your razor blades.  Yeah.  The sign is still up, dispose razor blades here.  That just shows you how old this fucking plane was.  There's the flip up ashtrays in your armrests.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Where you used to be able to just light up a lucky on your flight.  And that's what we were supposed to fly into like Utah, and then take like a really, really 
[02:45:30]  tiny plane into Vegas.  It's going to be Salt Lake City, and then Salt Lake City to Vegas.  And you know, that short flight, they put you on a smaller plane, and I believe they  had you on a MD-80, which are just...  Oh my Jesus.  First of all, they're old, and there's been quite a few of those that have had some problems.  I'd rather sit in the fucking hull of a FedEx plane.  Just drop me off in a fucking parachute.  And your box ear opens, your frozen body falls out.  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  And Kenny's a very responsible person.  Kenny, weren't you in charge of like the CMAs?  Security and stuff?  Well, I was there.  You know, I'm kind of modest, so...  You were one of the big wigs as far as security went for the Country Music Awards.  Oh, really?  They've got to start taking him seriously in Washington.  He's the real deal.  Well, the thing is, you know, even though I'm punished and can't go on this trip, I  was still trying to salvage things for you guys.  Yeah, I understand that.  I did lose my mind the other night.  All right.  Poor Don, he had to take that one. 
[02:46:30]  Oof.  I spent hours online with the airlines and then finally got on the phone.  Yeah.  And got a reservation.  I guess we're going through Cleveland.  Yeah.  Guess whose idea that was?  That was your idea, but I had already figured it out, Jimmy.  No.  I had.  No, but I wanted...  But it took me hours.  I could have just called you.  I wanted credit.  I wanted credit.  I was surprised when you said Cleveland, because I was like, wait, that's what I booked last  night.  I wanted credit.  I got LaGuardia to Cleveland. 
[02:47:00]  But I invented Cleveland.  To Vegas.  To Vegas.  Who, who, who, who, who, who, who are...  And by the way, for those of you that want to thank Kenny for his perseverance, you'll  be able to see him this evening at Caroline's with old Jimmy Norton.  Oh!  I'll be there.  Kenny, you're going Saturday too, right?  I'll be there every night selling merchandise.  See, he's a loyal, loyal guy.  Selling merchandise.  All right, Kenny, I'll see you Saturday at Caroline's for the Jim Norton show.  All right, so I take it you're satisfied with your current arrangements and I don't 
[02:47:30]  have to, you don't want these?  Uh, no.  Uh, Don, uh, took care of us in the end.  Okay.  Because I'm sure he's feeling a little bad about himself right now in his cubicle down  there in Washington.  Let it be known that, uh, Don ended up taking care of us and we'll be, uh, fine with the  arrangements he, uh, came up with.  Yeah.  Okay, I, I tried.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right, have a nice day, Kevin.  Oh, he's flustered now.  Yeah, why are you so flustered?  Why are you flustered?  Because he let us down, he's thinking. 
[02:48:00]  But you didn't.  But you didn't.  Here comes, here come the emails to everybody.  I'm sorry I let you down.  Guys.  Guys, I just want you to know.  Well, you know, I have very low self-esteem and no self-worth.  I want to apologize for the flights I couldn't get that amounted to the flights that you  wouldn't be flying upon to go from New York to Las Vegas for the CES, which I would have  liked to have joined you for, but last year something happened on my way to Alice's restaurant.  That's what his letters are like. 
[02:48:30]  It's like the transcript of Alice's fucking restaurant.  They are five pages long, no spaces of just guilt and apologies.  Yeah.  No sentences.  There's like one period and a semi-colon on page three.  And he never gets to the chorus.  And look for Kenny on ComedyCentral.com.  Very funny.  I saw you a little bit where you went into the Chinese buffet and grabbed the buckets 
[02:49:00]  and started loading food into the buckets and drove the Chinese woman crazy.  Oh, really?  I haven't checked that out yet.  It's all you can eat.  We're eating here.  And then they take their chairs and pull them right up to the buffet and start eating  out of the trays.  Well, that's great.  Call the police.  Yeah.  Very funny gentleman, Kenny.  I have some more bits coming up on that ComedyCentral.com thing also.  Don't we have one together?  Ooh.  That's going to be on the actual Meet the Creeps DVD.  Oh, I saw that at Chicken Fuckers. 
[02:49:30]  No.  You hold it and...  I hated that too.  The chicken costume was so hot.  Kenny, can you tell us about the next bit that's coming out?  Yes.  You know how people...  Oh.  Oh.  How could you do that?  Oh my God.  You just kicked a puggle.  You just kicked a six foot five killer.  Yeah, yeah.  Who's armed.  Yeah.  Good job.  He's always armed.  Kenny, I know you're listening.  I'm sorry, Kenny.  I'm sorry, Kenny.  That wasn't me.  I'm really sorry about that one.  Good luck, bro. 
[02:50:00]  I would have kept you on the phone for the rest of the show.  Absolutely.  Entertaining.  Loving.  Caring.  Tender.  Alright, someone was requesting a mashup on the old instant feedback.  So we'll play this one as we go to break.  We'll give Drew Boogie a rest, alright?  He's been working very hard today.  What's wrong with Drew Boogie?  I like him.  He's been working very hard.  What's wrong with the racism?  Yeah, geez.  We only had one black joke in front of him.  The why can't we be friends one.  That was cute, right?  I didn't like it.  It was hurtful and it was mean-spirited. 
[02:50:30]  It was.  Good point.  Drew, it was cute, right?  It was alright.  Hey, it was alright.  I'll forgive you this time.  I am lucky us.  I won't ban you yet.  Well, lucky us.  Here's a mashup as we go to break.  We could do it.

[02:56:30]  Nice.  Got your book in the studio doing some remixing for us the day before Thanksgiving. 
[02:57:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  My sister was just dancing on the Ellen DeGeneres show.  I saw that.  I want to thank Gary Hahn down there in Washington.  He hooked up my sister and my sister's sister-in-law.  They went and saw the taping of Ellen and we took a peek during the commercials and there's my sister dancing on TV.  In plain view.  In plain view for all to see.  There she was and Opie's just like, oh boy, oh boy, there she is. 
[02:57:30]  She bought the myth.  She enjoys the dancing, I guess.  What can I tell you?  How did XM get Ellen and let Sirius get Martha Stewart?  How did we let that get away?  I have no idea.  What a fucking awful debacle move that was by that dumb company.  All right.  She's got all the shows on TV.  Oh, that's right.  One of them was just...  Ellen is one of the hottest comics in the country from the show.  I mean, she's on fire.  That's who you get.  The chicks like her.  The women.  I like her.  I don't like her show, but I like her. 
[02:58:00]  Woman.  I'm not a woman.  I just think she's a good stand-up.  She's a good comedian.  The dancing makes me physically ill.  For a woman comic, which is all right.  Hey, we have a lot of...  I don't judge things on gender.  Pardon me.  We have a lot of pests outside the studio today.  We have No Filter Paul and Sonny Farrelly and Pat from Minaki just arrived from his eating  contest.  All right.  Making a funny face.  Is that a big-ass member out there somewhere?  There he is.  And who else?  Who's that?  What?  Who are you? 
[02:58:30]  Sonny Farrelly.  I said your name.  You attention-seeking whore.  Oh, my God.  Language.  They're all getting uppity.  They're all getting uppity outside the studio.  Can I say that Britney Spears on the cover of the Post in this half-leather skirt thing  is fucking depressingly hot.  But that's not how she looks today.  That's an old shot.  An old shot.  That is her from an era gone by.  That is one of the sexiest photos I've ever seen.  That belly sticks out a little further than that these days.  That didn't have a log in it.  She's great. 
[02:59:00]  Her thighs are a little big, though.  Dude, they're juicy.  Juicy?  All right.  You want the guys, some of the pests, to come in and say hi?  Eh, we'll see what they were up to, I guess.  All right.  Saw Pat on TV.  Yeah, let's start with Pat.  Oh, now no Phil DePaul's pissed because we said...  Oh, well, hi.  Look, there's a hierarchy out there, and they're all getting bumped, and if one gets bumped  for another, they get pissed.  Relax.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, guys.  Are you losing weight?  Hey, what's that?  Are you losing weight? 
[02:59:30]  I'm trying.  You look like you're losing weight.  I'm still stuck at that 300 barrier.  Let me see.  Move over that way a little bit.  Open up your sweatshirt.  Let's see.  Oh, jeez.  No, he's not.  No, he's not.  It's just the zipper.  Yeah.  Having the zipper zipped up.  Big coat.  Kept all the hurdles.  He's wearing a little midriff top.  That's a regular shirt for anybody else.  You want to make out?  Want a kiss or something?  All right.  All right.  Here's the deal.  A week from today is the eggnog drinking contest. 
[03:00:00]  That is correct.  Pat is the reigning champion.  We got truckers and stuff that are going to take you on.  Reigning eggnog.  Meh.  Now that he's a professional, though, should this prohibit him from this competition?  And now that he's a professional, does he even want to bother with something as trivial as this?  For sure.  Yeah.  All good questions there, Anthony.  Yeah, thank you.  Too bad I don't have any answers for you. 
[03:00:30]  No, you've got nothing.  You stink.  You think you can do 70 shots again this year?  Uh, yeah, with my water training, I believe, yes, I could surpass the 70 mark.  Water training.  Now, what is this?  Well, the other day you were talking about drinking water and the electrolytes being washed away.  Uh-huh.  And the lightheadedness.  I have experienced that.  You have?  I've had, like, two gallons of water and you get, like, high, man.  Yeah, because you're on the brink of what they call death. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, cool.  Yeah.  And then you feel a little woozy.  But what does the water training do for you as an eating competitor?  It expands your stomach, and your stomach retains the memory of it being stretched.  So when you go into an eating competition, it is pliable.  It knows how far it can go and doesn't start feeling full until it reaches that point.  That is correct.  Wow.  All right.  And have you found that you've been able to eat more and more as you've become a veteran in this competitive eating? 
[03:01:30]  I believe so.  Yeah.  Is it good to do the water training like the morning you're supposed to eat?  No, because then you have lots of fluids in you.  I was kidding.  You've got to peel.  Yeah, yeah.  I feel like such a thing.  Are you still ranked?  You're still ranked in the world?  Yes, I'm very ranked.  Oh, okay.  I'm ranked 15th in the IFO CE.  15th out of all of them?  Yes, in the world.  And how many are there?  There's lots of eaters. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  The rankings go up to like 50.  50?  Yes.  So you're 15th out of like 50?  Yeah.  All right.  He's doing pretty good.  Yeah, not bad.  Not bad.  Not bad.  And we'll be doing the eggnog drinking contest next Friday.  The day before in Atlantic City, they're going to have a Carmine's restaurant in Harrah's  Casino.  They're going to have a meatball eating contest.  I missed out on the registration for that.  Oh, damn you.  What a shame.  Good thing all the professional eaters are going to be in Atlantic City, and I'll be here  drinking eggnog.  So you're on TV this morning? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, WB11.  Yeah, we saw you with a slice of turkey on your head.  I was wearing them behind my ears and being a complete jackass.  That's my forte.  Were you the one, did they keep going to you because you were the one that put on a little  bit of show?  You were the interesting character that they loved someone.  I was working on my hand-to-mouth coordination, shoving food in my forehead.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  And how did that work out this morning?  It was fun.  And then the last segment, I got to wear my Opie and Anthony shirt, and hopefully something  got on there. 
[03:03:00]  A little salt on the media there.  Yeah.  There you go.  How did it work out for someone?  What's that?  For someone, did they win?  Salt and pepper on the media.  Yeah, we heard it.  Oh, boy.  Who won?  Who won this morning?  Actually, the contest is taking place right now.  Oh.  But I'd rather be here with my buddy.  Oh, look at that.  He blew it off.  I got nowhere else to go on Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Never mind. 
[03:03:30]  Well, very good.  I'm looking forward to seeing you for the eggnog drinking.  Are you really going to be alone this Thanksgiving?  Well, I'm going to have my dog and three cats.  Oh!  Thank you for all your compassion.  What do you do for Thanksgiving, then?  I usually go get to Boston Market.  Get some turkey.  Turkey at Boston Market.  Sides of stuffing?  No, I don't eat there.  I go home and sit in front of the TV and eat. 
[03:04:00]  Have we ever...  Thank you.  Have we ever delved into his personal life?  Do you want to?  Like I'm ready to dive headfirst into?  I don't want to talk in my personal life.  No?  That bad?  Yeah.  I'm just wondering because it's never a good thing.  It's never like I'm not having Thanksgiving with a family or family members because they  are busy researching a cure for AIDS that day.  Or dead.  It's always something bad. 
[03:04:30]  Either dead or out of your life somewhere.  The whole family's dead?  No.  Who's dead?  My sister's around, but her husband thinks I'm a piece of shit.  Who's dead?  Why?  Mommy, Daddy.  Mommy and Daddy are dead.  My brother, who...  As far as I'm concerned, he's dead.  Oh, dead to you?  Yes.  Why, Pat?  Oh, Jesus.  Help me.  You know, what's...  You kid...  How did this happen? 
[03:05:00]  What did you do with your brother?  Oh, my brother?  He's just a jerk-off.  Why?  I used to work for him, and he was a real asshole.  He had a...  He was actually in the news.  He had a Major League Baseball field in his backyard.  He used to live in Tewksbury.  Tewksbury?  Jersey.  Oh.  Yeah.  And he had a Major League...  Was he Kevin Costner?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they called it Field of Dreams, and the neighbors were complaining, and it made CBS  48 Hours, some segment about neighbors fighting with each other. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was interesting.  And then he moved to Florida, so I don't give a shit.  That's it.  But, uh...  Any friends that you could go to their house?  I have one friend.  Yeah.  He's married.  Might as well be dead.  Meh.  So how come your sister's boyfriend thinks you're a piece of shit?  Yeah.  Her husband.  I'm sorry.  Her husband.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...  Ah, you see, no, he's just a turd.  That's not...  You're very vague, Pat.  Stop being vague.  Yeah.  Why does he think you're a piece of shit?  Uh, uh, uh, uh...  Well, we used to live together in a big house.  Like a mother-daughter house. 
[03:06:00]  Aw.  See, that sounds nice.  A brother-sister house.  Yeah, and, uh, like, I had dogs.  He didn't like animals.  I understand that completely.  Yeah.  I'd have thrown your ass out, too.  Yeah.  Piece of shit ruining my furniture with your dogs.  Was it a puggle?  No, it wasn't.  Oh, okay, see?  Golden Retriever.  Fuck him.  Meh.  Meh.  Kill him.  Wow, this is kind of tragic.  Yeah, it is.  He's got a little tragic life thing going on there.  Oh, yeah, it should have.  But it's not, it's not, though, because it's like, how come your sister's husband doesn't  like you?  I had dogs. 
[03:06:30]  What happened with your brother?  We lived together, and it was, uh, arguments, and...  Oh, nice, thank you.  I smell where you're coming from, dude.  And your sister, though, instead of saying, hey, to the husband, hey, you know, go fuck yourself.  This is my brother, it's family, and she just seems to have taken his side?  No, no, well, she was kind of in the middle.  She was kind of silent, and he, uh, and we ended up just moving out of the house.  Look at, look at how uncomfortable he is.  Nah, I'm not looking at it.  He doesn't like talking about this.  No, I mean, no, I don't. 
[03:07:00]  Why are you a strange...  So you'd be swallowing a lot of grain today, and some food.  Why are you estranged from your family?  You are estranged.  Because I'm estranged.  Oh, my God, he's coming up with water.  He is just trying to cover this up.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the clown, the tears of a clown back there.  Did I tell you about my idea for a radio show?  So why are you going to, why on Thanksgiving?  It's a family holiday, there's supposed to be a lot of love, you're going to be alone.  Uh, because I'm a loner, a rebel.  No close friends to, uh...  Nah, there's one friend, he said. 
[03:07:30]  What's your idea for a radio show?  Oh, uh, Pat from Munaki's Cavalcade of Comedy.  Hello?  Okay.  Is this thing on?  Cavalcade.  Yes.  Couldn't it start with a trickle of comedy?  You know, all those...  You don't go right to the Cavalcade.  How about...  You know all those comedians that Opie says,  we've got to get you on the show, and he has no plans of getting him on the show?  Yeah.  Put him on my show.  Oh?  And then I'll, I'll, they'll give me their act, uh, we'll go back and forth, 
[03:08:00]  they'll tell me about their act.  You could run block.  Yeah.  And, uh, kind of weed him out so we never have to see him.  That is true.  Sort of like your brother-in-law does to your sister.  Yeah.  Pat's on the line.  Oh, well.  Tell him I'm dead.  Meh.  All right, we should get the rest of the pests in here.  They've been waiting all morning.  I feel so bad now.  He's going to be just sitting there with some Boston Market turkey in his lap,  watching television all along.  In his stupid underwear, with his feet in front of him,  just having nine little distractions.  That's right, I have cable. 
[03:08:30]  Aw, he has cable.  Aw.  Aw.  He'll be a big star next week, though, next Friday.  Yeah, but we'll all be with friends and family, laughing and hugging.  All right, look at this psychopath.  All right, what's your name, sir?  Besides Fat Brother Joe.  Hey, it's funny.  No, I meant, uh, this one.  Yeah, who am I?  Yeah, who are you?  Yeah.  I'm the guy that Pat's trying to steal the show from.  Ooh.  Aw.  The jealousy here.  The pest.  Shut up.  You at least have a loved one to go home to.  That's right.  And have some turkey with.  Yeah, so does his, but he probably has four legs. 
[03:09:00]  Let's be fair, we'll drink eggnog for it.  Ooh.  Yeah, you can have a half and a head start.  And Sonny Ferrelli, everyone.  Hi.  The reigning Assault in the Media champion.  Who?  Sonny Ferrelli, and don't you forget it.  Who?  Sonny Ferrelli, you asshole.  No one in New York knows who you are.  They know who Sonny Ferrelli is.  Well, they do know who I am now.  Ah.  That's right.  These guys battle it out every month for the Assault in the Media title.  And, uh, no filter Paul is in the lead this month.  You know that.  Yeah.  Sonny, are you going to attempt to take him down or no? 
[03:09:30]  I got plans.  Most definitely got plans.  He usually waits for the last minute, Sonny Ferrelli.  Now, we got Sonny.  I swear to you, it looks like somebody who just, like, shanks people out in the prison  yard.  Yeah.  You absolutely look like a lunatic.  If he shaved, he'd be Wolf from Escape from Alcatraz.  Wow.  I get that a lot.  I get that a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, like some, like, wild staring eyes.  It's a good, yeah.  You got those wild that darting around all over the place.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[03:10:00]  Works for you.  But listen, hey, I got a whole bunch of gifts for you guys.  Oh, we love gifts.  I love gifts.  Gifts have always worked on this show.  It is the holiday season.  That's right.  I expect many, many gifts this holiday season.  What about Christmas there, Pat from Monaki?  What do you do on Christmas?  Boston Market has a lovely Christmas selection of food.  But what about exchanging any gifts with loved ones?  Does that happen with your family?  Is there a card with your sister?  If it happens, oh, yeah, I send her a card or something.  Yeah.  She sends you one?  How many gifts do you have to buy for Christmas? 
[03:10:30]  Doesn't he give them out at the mall?  Well, for my friends, nieces, and nephews, I get gifts.  Your friends, nieces, and nephews?  And how many gifts will you receive this Christmas?  Maybe one.  Or not?  Oh, my God.  This is tragic.  God bless us all, everyone.  This is tragic.  One too many.  Your life just got more tragic.  Who's going to send you the gift?  Did I mention I live in a trailer?  Who's going to send you the gift? 
[03:11:00]  Hey, that was a good one.  What was that?  Who's going to send you the gift?  Uh, I don't know.  Maybe my sister.  Maybe.  So you might get one.  What are you going to get, you think?  What was your gift?  Chia.  Chia.  I used to get Farside calendars.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  They're kind of the same one after a few years.  You know what?  I'm going to get you.  At least stop making new ones.  I'm going to have a star named after you.  Well, thanks.  That's a special gift.  The black hole?  How many years have you been an orphan? 
[03:11:30]  An orphan.  Orphan.  My mother kicked off in 81, I believe.  It was like right after I graduated.  Like I went to a graduation party, got drunk.  She yelled and screamed at me.  Next morning, she croaked.  Oh, my God.  No guilt there.  Holy shit.  So you come home drunk from a graduation party.  Yeah.  She gets upset at you and yells and screams.  And now I got to know, was it some kind of medical condition that was maybe... 
[03:12:00]  She was like a four-pack-a-day smoker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  And that was 81.  What did she die of?  Congestive heart failure.  So was she overweight?  Getting twitches here.  Was she overweight?  Yeah, somewhat.  A little bit.  A little bit.  She was a bit like me.  Skinny legs.  Yeah.  Did you yell at her, too?  What's that?  Did you yell at her?  No.  She yelled at you and you...  I did get to the point where, you know, when your mother's, like, slapping and you get 
[03:12:30]  to the point where you can hold her hands and it's just, stop holding my hands or I can  hate you.  Yeah.  It wasn't that night.  I just yelled at you.  But, you know, the last night you spent with your mom was arguing.  She was screaming her lungs out.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding me.  Using those last precious breaths to yell at me.  Oh, Jesus.  Pat.  Who found her?  Oh, no, no.  She went to the...  We took her to the hospital.  She was having a heart attack and then she croaked in the hospital. 
[03:13:00]  Wow.  Then I got to see a nice tube coming out of her neck with black shit oozing out because  she was a smoker.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, fun.  Happy joy, joy.  So that happened in 81.  Yes.  She left in the trailer.  And Dad left, like, two minutes after he saw my kisser.  Oh, that's right.  Your father, like, cut out on you right after you were born.  Do you remember your father?  What?  You never met your father?  Uh, no.  I know where he lives.  I even got his phone number. 
[03:13:30]  You do?  You ever called him?  Why haven't you made that?  I think I called him once and he's like, hello?  I just hung up on him.  I wanted to hear Dad's voice.  Why don't we call him now?  Not you.  Let's call him now.  No, no, no.  Why not?  Oh, look at that.  All of a sudden, it wasn't like, no, no, let's not do that.  It was, no, no, no.  It was the serious path.  Why haven't you tried to...  Going into the standing fetal position.  Why haven't you tried to make real contact?  Obviously, if you're calling just to hear and pick the phone up, you want to make some  kind of a...  Well, that was just plain curiosity. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, but...  Like, in the satisfaction of, oh, Daddy, please, please love me, Daddy.  You know something?  There is room between calling and hanging up.  And, oh, Daddy, I love you and I need you.  There is some gray area that perhaps, you know, maybe you can get in a big fight with  him and he could die the next day.  Ooh.  Or something.  Wow.  Yeah, maybe he could die of blunt force trauma.  My mother only chased me around with a butcher knife. 
[03:14:30]  Ooh.  Really?  Is she still alive?  Oh, yeah.  I'll say then there's no competition.  She's a psychopath, though.  Doesn't matter.  Oh.  This is the saddest human I've ever, ever had the pleasure of knowing.  Why don't we, uh...  I think you should call him on the air and ask him.  Yeah, let's...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's got a miserable life for your radio plotter.  Not what we have so far.  Oh, yeah.  I think if you, at any point, feel ready to reach out and you want to use our forum maybe 
[03:15:00]  to buffer things, that we would not have any problem whatsoever contacting him and letting  him know that there is a baby boy out there that...  A baby from Munaki.  That he had a little pad from Munaki and, you know, and you cut out on him and his mom  and she winds up dying.  He doesn't even know about her or care.  You can tell, he's really just...  Ah, I'm fine.  Yeah.  Just a boy who wants to know why he wasn't loved.  It was after graduation, though, so it was what? 
[03:15:30]  I know why I wasn't loved when I left the mirror.  Spring?  Oh, what?  Spring or summertime when your mom departed?  Uh, that was in the, uh, I believe the beginning of...  It was right after I graduated.  Yeah.  It was like, uh...  Oh, jeez.  He graduated.  Oh, good.  My work's done.  Oh, oh.  Oh, boy.  That's why he died of surprise.  Yeah.  So, that was it.  Yeah, good one.  He's actually hoping his father dies soon so he can align that third trailer to make,  you know...  My third?  Yeah, your third. 
[03:16:00]  Third.  Because right now he's got a double wide from when the mother died.  I love that cartoon, Elmer third.  Hey, Sonny has presents.  Sonny has presents.  He came all the way from Boston.  He came all the way from Boston.  I like presents.  I have to give this cereal to Jimmy because, you know, he was...  Oh, thank you, Mike.  I saw that.  What is that called?  It reminded me of Jimmy so much.  Mighty Bites.  Let me see the picture.  No!  Why does that remind you of Jimmy so much?  It turns flashlight on the front of it.  Oh, it looks like a little Jimmy. 
[03:16:30]  A little Jimmy, you know.  He's being super.  He's being...  That's Jimmy Robinson.  I was going to add the monster, Mighty Monster Bites on it.  Mighty Monster Bites.  Hold on.  We've got to go to Iowa.  All right.  Sean, go ahead.  Hey, uh...  How about we try to get Pat to dress up in an elf suit and go visit his daddy before Christmas?  I'll walk through the Lincoln Tunnel.  Pat, be all from Unaki.  Love you guys.  Thanks, man.  Does he live close? 
[03:17:00]  Like, is he in the area?  Where does he live?  Who?  Dad.  Your dad.  Oh, yeah.  Dear old dad.  He lives close?  Yep.  Man, I ain't getting any more specific.  No, no.  I'm not asking for any towns or anything, but...  New Jersey, New York, the tri-state area?  Yeah, tri-state area.  You've driven by his house?  You've had to have driven by, taken a look, what did he drive?  I grew the earth bit.  Oh, you did?  How many miles?  You put a little bullseye on it.  How many miles from you?  I know you checked.  Uh, you're zeroing in.  Yeah, zeroing in.  No, not.  You're locking in. 
[03:17:30]  How many miles from you?  I don't even know where I'm at.  Not far.  Not far.  Within, uh...  Same trailer park or the next road?  How many miles?  Ten.  About ten miles?  Yeah.  Less.  I know you've driven by.  No, no.  Just to see what he drives, what the house looks like, if it's nice.  Just to take a look at his new happy family.  Does he have a family?  Boy, you don't live in a metal box, Dad.  Does he have a new family with a wife and children, stuff like that?  I have no idea.  You know.  You can look that stuff up online, you know, for a small fee. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, I can look it up for him right now.  Pop a name.  Yeah, I know, Paul Offord.  How did you find him?  What?  How did you find out his number?  You must have looked.  Yeah.  I looked in a very, uh, convenient, uh, resource.  Why?  Uh, just out of curiosity.  Just, you wanted to see what his digits were?  You know what?  Yeah.  You know what you've just done?  What?  Given out enough information for the pests to find that fucking phone number.  Oh, thank you.  They are awful people.  They will just work this out and you will see it posted on fucking Wackpack.  Oops.  Fine.  Pat's father. 
[03:18:30]  Pictures.  Assault on the Pat's father.  And bring him to us.  Mr. from Munaki.  Yeah.  I got, I got Opie some gay cereal.  Because I know that he can't buy it himself, so.  Well, it's like.  Oh, heart to heart.  Heart to heart?  That's terrific.  Can I have a bowl, please?  And good friends.  And some of that cereal that, uh, Jimmy spit out the other day.  Yeah, Jimmy was eating good friends.  Good friends was awful.  Nice interracial couple in the front of it.  It's awful.  Thank you, Sonny.  It was like, you know, going to the supermarket last night and I was, it was almost like, uh, 
[03:19:00]  getting Kotex or something for my old lady.  Yeah, it seems like you put a lot of fun into these gifts.  What a good guy he is.  He brings gifts.  Jesus.  Oh, wait a minute.  These other guys show up with nothing.  What, no milk?  I want, I need, I need the milk.  Febreze.  You guys need some Febreze.  You guys have got to lay off the Lysol.  I don't know.  You're right.  You ever use this stuff?  Yeah, we'll start using it.  February Febreze Fabric Shoffener?  No.  Oh, that was it.  Are you trying to write the Magna Carta? 
[03:19:30]  That's for you, sir.  Oh, I can't take that.  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  That is a wonderful Black & Decker cordless drill set.  Oh, thank you.  I can't breathe.  It's a bitch you got.  No, no, no.  That's drilling and screwing needs.  Wow.  Look at that, Jimmy, huh?  No, no.  It's like Jimmy's Black & Decker Pekka Rucka.  That is a good one.  No, no.  It's got to be bigger.  This is not the good one.  What an asshole.  That is very good.  14 volts, not 18.  Jimmy, do you have the dildo at home?  Well, I remember specifically, he asked for something over 50 bucks. 
[03:20:00]  You missed the jam.  Do you have the dildo at home you will be attaching to that?  You're a fucking asshole.  Made him say it.  Let me repeat it, you fucking idiot.  You made him say it.  You probably could have gotten a third one out of it.  I knew.  He had a lot of confidence.  I know.  Jimmy smiled at me and said, wait, wait, do it again.  Wait, wait, do it again.  Hey.  It's like telling Joe Feisman, you want to do that play again?  Shut up.  I can't believe you map quested it.  No, Google Earth.  Google Earth.  Can you give us the precise... 
[03:20:30]  It's like you're flying.  Yeah, it's like you're flying over it.  Thank you.  Flying over it, dropping some bombs.  Yeah.  And of course...  How much do you spend on this, man?  I can't take you...  No, no, no, no.  Please.  Thank you.  And Jennifer, I've got to make sure I get the right one here.  Oh, this is to the fancy guy.  Uh-huh.  And this one's to Opie.  Oh, thank you, Sonny.  Wow.  Look at that.  Give him a little secret.  Outback Steakhouse.  Ooh.  You people eat them.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Yeah, you know...  Thank you, sir.  I like Outback.  No Phil DePaul was telling me not to give it to you on the air because you might rip it 
[03:21:00]  up, but I turned around and said, well, if they rip it up, it's just like me taking a  bulimic to dinner.  That's wonderful, sir.  You fucked up next.  I do not destroy...  Sonny Vermoon, I do not destroy good gifts.  That's right.  Little known fact.  Something tells me this is not good cereal.  This will start the gift-giving...  What does it look like?  It looks like Alphabets.  Jimmy was looking for the little cherub inside the box.  Is it one of those Kashi cereals for kids?  I like the Kashi... 
[03:21:30]  Oh, no, you don't.  You don't like any Kashi?  Shut up.  No, dude, I love the...  No, you don't.  They rule.  Dude, I dropped a log yesterday.  I swear to God.  11 inches.  This promotes healthy logs.  Is that a kosher brand?  No, it's a Kashi brand.  I know.  I'm just saying, is that a kosher brand?  A fucking Kike cereal?  No, no.  All right.  There's a hint of cinnamon.  Can I try it in?  It's almost like cinnamon toast crunch stuff.  Okay, all right.  I'm in.  Not bad.  Not bad.  For a healthy cereal.  It's not great. 
[03:22:00]  Not as sweet as a kid's cereal.  No, no, no.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like a healthy cereal.  Can I get a bowl of this?  Not bad.  Get a bowl for the boss, for Christ's sake.  Oh, that's...  I'd ruin them.  I expected the cereal to be all over the place.  I'd like a bowl of this, too.  I want a paper bowl.  I want a plastic spoon.  Do you want some lactate?  I want some lactate, and I want some of the cereal,  because I want all three of us to be eating cereal  for the end of this show after that.  By the way, just to really...  Sorry, the Germans marching through Paris.  By the way, we're millionaires. 
[03:22:30]  You are an asshole.  This is weed shit.  Jimmy isn't.  He's got to finish chewing before...  Believe me.  I know.  I now feel like Pat in front of that TV alone.  Oh!  Balls for everybody.  There you go, Anthony.  Let me have some of the lactate milk,  so I don't have a...  Hand me stand for me.  Oh. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, that's a stump that looks like an oil derrick explosion later.  Here we go.  I just served those in toilet bowls.  Are you guys really telling me that this shit actually tastes good?  Not bad.  It's not bad.  What, you're trying to go for a joke today?  It's not bad.  Your evil plan backfired, huh, Sonny?  It's sort of.  Ha, ha, ha.  Mmm.  Ooh, sour milk, too.  Sort of.  It's not sour, Opie.  It's cinnamon.  Milk is swirl.  Is it that fucking pretend milk?  Ew.  Is that fake shit?  No, no.  That's really... 
[03:23:30]  It's not fake.  It's for people that are lactose intolerant.  I think if Pat drinks that, his tits will start leaking.  Nipple on the top of it.  What?  It's like a lactating thing, but it's so...  Oh, my God.  Oh.  It was so fun.  I lacked toe.  That old guy.  He says he lacked toe.  Oh, God, here we go. 
[03:24:00]  I'm eating, Jimmy.  Hey, a place to park my bike.  Don't spray it.  It'll go in his cereal.  Oh, Jesus.  Jimmy now has chocolate milk.  Dude, he just farted right next to his cereal.  With his pants down.  Like the mic is...  It's like Cocoa Puffs.  I didn't think that was that funny.  This is a bad sense of humor. 
[03:24:30]  It's awful.  It's not awful, Opie.  Well, it's cinnamon-y, so it's kind of sweet.  You guys got anything else?  You want to talk about our failed attempt?  Yeah, what happened?  No, not really.  I wonder what happened.  I'm curious.  Who else is outside?  It's very unfunny, too.  It's crunchy.  It doesn't get soggy.  Opie, you're not trying the cereal with the negro on the front of it?  Mm-mm.  Ooh.  That's great.  You put the milk on with a fire hose. 
[03:25:00]  Holy crap.  What, are you trying to keep the cereal out of college?  Yeah.  Oh, that's awful.  Oh.  Got to squeeze the jokes in between bikes.  Captain Kanga Spook.  Well, I don't know.  Come on, go on.  Big ass.  What's up, bro?  What the fuck?  Hey, there he is.  How you doing?  That's far of a calling to say, don't give my information out.  Actually, you want to be known as Bam now? 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, it's just easier.  It's quicker.  Yeah.  And big, fucking annoying, unfunny kike.  Dude, he's done some good stuff for the show as well.  Say the word free.  I've been watching.  Okay, one, two, four.  You guys did a number.  We're a team.  We're a team.  You guys did a number on Howard outside of Letterman, huh?  Yeah, we did.  I was actually in the assault on the media with Paul.  That's the winner for the month.  I was a trumpet player.  Okay.  Nice job.  Well, it's not a winner yet, but it's looking pretty good.  We'll get another one in there.  We've got, like, next week, and then we'll declare one.  We have plans for tomorrow morning, another little attack by the pests. 
[03:26:00]  All right.  Yeah.  And we have special plans for certain someone coming up in the future.  So we'll just leave it like that.  Who are you talking about?  I don't know.  We're going to be smuggling things to the past to help you guys along with these assaults on the media.  And the assault on the enemy, by the way.  Who's that?  I told you it was his father.  Huh?  His father.  Yeah.  Who's calling, Pat?  Father being used to calling.  I don't know.  Voicemail.  All right.  Who is it?  You want to hear it?  I'll play it live. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Well, from what you're talking about yourself, you don't have anybody calling you or anything.  Got no friends, no family.  He's still on his original minutes.  What's that noise?  I don't know.  Whose phone?  You better hope it ain't your dad.  That's a phone?  I don't know.  Okay.  Fucking size of a nigger's dick.  Look at that.  Oh, God.  Son, is that you?  Uh, you want to give me a call, Brad, please?  And as soon as you can, because I got my car and you got one more. 
[03:27:00]  What?  I got a delivery.  In New York City, and I got a delivery.  Pat, your trailer is on fire.  You're shirking your responsibility.  That's my customer, Brad Pack, in Garwood, New Jersey.  All right, turn off your phone.  Yeah, it's messing up everything.  Oh, God damn.  And Flea, stop calling me every time I'm on the air.  No one gives a fuck.  You're not funny.  Shut the fuck up.  Don't go on the messy sports ever again.  Which one is Flea? 
[03:27:30]  What's wrong with Flea?  Fucking that Flea.  Annoying little shit.  Is he the little guy with glasses?  Yeah, he's that little kike that we all hate.  He's applying for an intern here.  Are you saying Flea's a pest?  Unbelievable.  Jimmy, could you hand me the cereal?  Because I still have a little milk left in here.  What?  Are you taking the rest?  No, no, no.  I thought he was going to take the rest of it.  He's emptying the box so he can jerk off into it later with that little kid on the front.  Can I have the milk, sweetie?  Shut up, Paul. 
[03:28:00]  Paul, can I have the milk, sweetie?  No.  Opie, I want milk!  This could be one of the most inconsiderate programs we've ever given our listeners.  I'm going to throw it.  No, don't throw it!  He's going to throw it!  Oh, my God!  He's going to throw it!  Oh, my God!  Catch it!  Get it!  Holy shit!  Throws an open carton of fucking milk.  All right, well, I apologize to our listeners today.  What?  For what?  Very inconsiderate of it.  They eat, we eat.  Fuck them.  Do these gifts better my chances of winning this month's Attack on the Media contest? 
[03:28:30]  Oh, shut up.  You haven't even done one yet for this month.  Yeah.  I figure all I need to do is show myself in front of the camera.  We need to do an assault on Weight Watchers, fatty.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Don't worry.  Mars is all paranoid that we're actually wrecking his equipment today.  Is there any left there?  Uh, yeah, a little bit left.  You're digging it, aren't you?  It's all right.  It's not bad.  I've got, like, seven days left.  It's like an eternity for me.  Ooh. 
[03:29:00]  Hmm.  20 minutes is what you need.  Last night a month.  Anthony Jagermeister, music tour featuring Disturb with special guest Corrosion of Conformity.  All right.

Now these guys are all hanging out together when we're not on the air.  What's wrong?  Oh, all right. 
[03:30:30]  The tickets for Disturbed, it's for Friday night.  I'm sorry.  I was thinking today was Friday.  Friday night in the Chicago area at the House of Blues.  Okay?  Steve from Toronto.  Can someone shut Paul the fuck up?  What a pompous, annoying sack of cunt.  What do you mean?  Hey, I'm on the radio.  Fuck you, faggot.  Well, they didn't see me on that one.  Wow, that's pretty tough.  Ooh.  All right, guys.  Filthy faggot.  Thank you.  We're going to try to end the show in style.  Anything else you guys want to add?  Anything?  Bam?  Nah, that's all. 
[03:31:00]  That's around it.  Thanks for all you do, sir.  No problem.  See you all tonight at the party at the Jimmy's.  All right.  And how do you join the O&A Army?  You basically got an instant message me, or private message me on Wackbag or something  like that.  And then you go through the process?  Once we gain your trust.  Oh, good luck with that.  Good luck with that.  The Army is growing every day, right?  Yes.  Growing every day, and it's all underground now, so.  Yes, I know it is.  And the pests.  You don't dislike Doug at Doug, do you?  Like my mother.  I'm trying to steal thunder.  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  Other guys don't like Doug.  I like Doug.  Yeah, I like Doug, too. 
[03:31:30]  He's a good boy.  All right.  Bye, guys.  I dig Doug.  And I'm Scott.  And I'm Sonny Pirelli, the king of all attack on the medias.  I'll say.  Get your fat ass out of the studio.  I got a quick note here from Kenny.  Can I have the milk?  Yes.  You can.  Got an email.  Well, dear sirs, I won't mention anything further or unnecessarily apologize for my lackluster telephone  call on your show today.  Lackluster.  But thank you for the Comedy Central plug. 
[03:32:00]  More importantly, do you want me to make a reservation and hold a table for you guys  at Caroline's?  Look at that.  Yes, Kenny.  I need a table for six Saturday night.  Thank you.  If so, please email me.  I will go.  Call me with detail.  No, he's listening.  I'll go to the late show.  Late show, Saturday night.  Make it happen.  Make it happen.  Have a nice Thanksgiving.  Regards, Kenny.  No long things.  See?  He's so guilty.  That was very nice of him.  Very guilty about that airline thing that went on.  Well, it was a humiliating failure. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  We can't take a break, old.  We got eight minutes left.  Where are we going to go?  That's it?  What are we going to do, then?  Let's just talk it to know each other.  What's wrong with friends being friends?  You can take one if you want.  Oh, yeah.  We'll take a break, Derek.  And then we'll finish the Opie and Anthony program in just a bit.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly 
[03:33:00]  good result.  The Opie and Anthony show.  In case you didn't know, it's the 4-7-202.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Ow.  I'm doing that live. 
[03:33:30]  Thank you.  See, I got the beat.  Cheddar.  Hey, I can play along there, Drew.  Drew Boogie in the studio.  Thanks for the help today, buddy.  No Filter Paul wants to know why we're laughing hysterically during the commercial break.  I'm going to come and ask you.  Yeah, come here, No Filter Paul.  He wants to ask something really fast.  Oh, boy.  What's going on, Paul?  No, nothing.  Just wondering why you're laughing.  We were commenting.  I mean, what?  A couple of pounds or what?  What's going on? 
[03:34:00]  You're like skinny fat, man.  You're like, you're just...  Patrick Winnocky's my hero.  What can I tell you?  Put the stomach on.  Why isn't the rest of you fat?  It's just eating.  It's weird.  You've got like thin arms, thin legs.  Your face isn't really that fat, but you've got like...  I've got a gut.  Yeah, I know.  It looks like I should be drinking beer, but I don't really drink beer, though.  What do you want to ask me?  Because I don't know the answer to what you guys ask them.  We're not doing the show this weekend.  I want to know if we're going to do it next weekend.  What show? 
[03:34:30]  The midnight show on Saturday.  You don't have an idea yet?  As soon as you come up with a good idea...  How many ideas did I give?  I just sent you a list.  He sent a big list.  How many did you want?  Remember the list we went over on the air?  We got a lot more, too.  I would make a proper prep sheet and send it to Steve.  You know what?  I was thinking of this last night because you know who gets the emails and stuff?  Me and my girlfriend get the emails from these guys now that say,  Hey, what's going on this weekend?  Are we doing the show or not?  Like, I'm the last one to ask.  Why?  You're not concerned?  Not at all.  And then I go, you know, this is probably so important to these guys. 
[03:35:00]  They would love to do something like that.  And to us, it's just another bit we'll never get to.  Yeah.  It's just that...  Wait, do you actually answer the emails?  No.  No, he's never...  Oh, delete.  No, no.  He made a delete.  He reads them on air sometimes.  He gets deleted with the fucking mortgage.  You could get a lower mortgage in Viagra.  Spam.  Yeah, I've just yet to click them into the spam fucking category.  Ends up in the bulk delete.  Yes.  Indeed.  Good to buy. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, you've...  I guess you have that list.  Yeah, we actually have a few more things now.  We're going to...  I will go over to...  A few more things.  The next time we're live on the air, okay?  That's fine.  We'll go over what you want to do.  On Monday, you said you were going to tell us tomorrow, and then Tuesday, you didn't mention it.  You did say that, I hope.  Sorry, you'll be free this Saturday.  Like we're ever going to tell the people who the arch enemy is?  Please.  Those people are really pissed.  Yeah.  See it every day on instant feedback.  Thank you, no filter.  That's how it's done, right?  All right. 
[03:36:00]  All right, guys.  Everyone have a good Thanksgiving.  I'm out.  Oh, yeah.  Thanksgiving.  Dude, you...  You nailed him.  You stink.  Yeah, that'll make it better.  You nailed him.  I know, really.  That'll make it better.  All right.  Sure.  By the way, I was taking a peek to my left here, and Hawk is checking out the video from  yesterday's Icy Hot thing.  The video clips are now up on opianthony.com. 
[03:36:30]  Is the wedgie the funniest thing ever?  I just saw the video of the wedgie.  Yeah.  It's very disturbing to see Big Steve giving the guys wedgies yesterday.  It looks like he's...  Actually, it looks like he's fucking him in the ass.  He's standing behind him, and you just go, ah!  And if Steve had his way, they would have been...  I'll put Icy Hot on it.  It won't hurt.  We better get Pat from Menachie in here.  Yeah.  Camo.  Camo.  I keep thinking it's Friday.  A week from Friday, I'm sorry, is the eggnog drinking contest.  Liar. 
[03:37:00]  Because I know we're going away for a couple days.  So it's a week from Friday, the eggnog drinking contest.  We found your father's address.  Enjoy.  Are you kidding?  I'll confirm or deny.  And he's already been sent the pizza.  Oh, nice.  Who did that?  Is that it?  Well, don't say who did it, because a lot of people are trying to figure it out.  You don't want to say who's right and who's wrong.  Ow.  Wow, you motherfuckers, man.  Already.  Sons of bitches.  Ten minutes later. 
[03:37:30]  They're amazing.  See?  Where did you...  Couldn't have been Regis.  How did you find that?  What, did you go to guyswhomadegreatdecisions.com?  Nothing on that one.  No, that's kind of funny.  That is funny.  I thought that would get a little something.  I didn't anticipate the complete vacuum of laughter.  Pat, we'll see you a week from Friday, okay?  For the eggnog drinking contest.  Okay.  You're going to have real competition this year.  That's true.  All right.  Lady Trucker, what's up? 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, it's a school.  Yeah.  Okay, terrific.  That's, uh...  Hey, Drew.  Gobbling chicken.  Yes, sir.  I want to thank Drew Boogie for stopping in today.  Absolutely.  You want to get us out of here?  We only have, like, 45 seconds in the show.  I can do it.  Have a good Thanksgiving, Pat.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I will. 
[03:38:30]  Get us out of here.  We're going to order a pizza.  I can do it.  Steps.  Oh, and a body rock.  Steps.  Oh, and a body rock.  Steps.  Oh, and a body rock.  Steps.  Oh, and a body rock.  Steps.  Oh, and a body rock.  Steps.  Oh, and a body rock. 
[03:39:00]  Steps.  Steps.  Oh, and a body rock.  This concludes our podcast day.  You'll be in the end of the show.  You </pre>
