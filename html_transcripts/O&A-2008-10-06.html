<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties involving Anthony's microphone.  The hosts then launched into a discussion about the financial crisis, playfully debating the optimal time to withdraw their savings, inventing a humorous scenario involving a fictional "Ted's Bank" and its president, Ted, who surprisingly appeared in the studio.  Anthony recounted a frustrating weekend visit to his mother's house, overwhelmed by numerous nephews and nieces, lamenting the lack of adult conversation.

The conversation shifted to O.J. Simpson's recent guilty verdict on armed robbery and kidnapping charges, with speculation about its timing in relation to the upcoming presidential election.  This segued into a lengthy discussion of Simpson's previous trial and acquittal.  Simultaneously, the hosts discussed Kimbo Slice's surprising quick knockout loss in a mixed martial arts fight against Seth Petroselli.  Jimmy, promoting his HBO special "Down and Dirty," was a guest during this portion.  The show frequently interspersed clips and commentary on an episode of "Quincy, M.E." throughout this section.  The Kimbo Slice loss was revisited, prompting a caller, Chrissa, to share a humorous anecdote about her husband's perspective on raising children.  This prompted further discussion about the hosts’ experiences with their own nieces and nephews, the challenges and disappointments of parenthood, and a call from John offering more perspective on Kimbo Slice's fighting.

The focus then turned to the 2008 presidential election, particularly Sarah Palin's campaign tactics and perceived inauthenticity.  Callers Jason and Adam contributed to the discussion, with Adam mentioning Sarah Palin's husband's alleged ties to an Alaskan secessionist group, leading to a comedic tangent about Alaskan wildlife. A clip featuring UFC president Dana White expressing skepticism about Kimbo Slice was played.  Patrice O'Neal joined the show in-studio, and the conversation took a sharp turn towards racial dynamics in American society, with Patrice sharing his perspectives on white people and the political climate.  He described his violent daydreams against white people, leading to a lengthy discussion about race, politics, fear, and respect. The conversation also touched upon an upcoming Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episode satirizing the election and concluded with further commentary on Sarah Palin.

The show continued with Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Patrice O'Neal discussing a hypothetical scenario about honest interracial dialogue, followed by a debate on the definition of felony kidnapping.  The conversation again shifted to race relations and election politics, focusing on O.J. Simpson's acquittal and accusations of election manipulation in Ohio. A news story about a Cleveland landlord placing hidden cameras in his tenants' bathrooms sparked humorous, sexually explicit jokes.  Patrice O’Neal’s stand-up show dates were promoted.  The discussion then transitioned to sports, specifically Manny Ramirez's departure from the Red Sox and the perceived lack of importance of certain teams.  This led to a discussion on the cultural significance of sports teams and the Baseball Hall of Fame's induction standards, including Pete Rose’s exclusion.  The conversation returned to the 2008 election, mocking Sarah Palin's television appearances and physical appearance.  O'Neal discussed visiting racist websites to understand different perspectives and shared personal experiences with racial prejudice.  The segment concluded with a discussion about ethical dilemmas in various professions, particularly the misuse of tasers by police officers.

A segment featuring loosely connected tangents began with a discussion about a man dying after a low fall, transitioning into rants about negative experiences with female customer service representatives and airport security.  Opie detailed his confrontations with TSA agents, followed by a discussion of a passive-aggressive conflict with his housekeeper and assistant, Keith, and Keith’s wife, Ange, over his laundry hamper.  A "Jocktober" segment heavily criticized a local radio show host, Terry Clifford, using extremely derogatory and offensive language concerning her weight, physical appearance, and personal life.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and a personal anecdote about Opie's financial advisor were briefly mentioned.

A lengthy, vulgar discussion about Terry Clifford's appearance dominated the next segment, with crude jokes about her weight, physical attributes, and child.  This transitioned into a discussion of a woman's engagement story and a listener's call describing Terry's attractive daughter.  A significant portion focused on the economic downturn and the Dow Jones Industrial Average's drop, with humorous discussions about alternative currency systems.  Investment strategies and anecdotes about "Biff Tannen" were mentioned. The final segment involved a JetBlue incident involving a flight attendant accused of showing nude photos and making inappropriate sexual advances; the hosts offered highly critical, misogynistic commentary on the passenger. Patrice O'Neal was a guest throughout this segment, and the show concluded with the announcement of the "line of the day."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Could you imagine one of us going onto the mic after a story  and then going, oh, that's sad and really meaningless?  Yes, you said my grandma fell down the steps  and she got up and nothing was broken.  Hey, the power of Christ compels you.  The power of dice compels you.  The power of dice compels you.  I'm going to say you must have a magical penis  because this is just unbelievable  that somebody would go to this extent after a breakup anthem.  I am such a... 
[00:00:30]  Whoa, I hit the dumb button on myself on that one.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, that's a good sound on the microphone.  I like that a lot.  It doesn't sound right.  Oh, no, something's a little amiss.  Hold on.  Yeah, is that better?  There we go.  It was the mic, I guess, huh?  What the hell is that about?  Isn't there a mic check that goes on? 
[00:01:00]  Hello.  I'm telling you, no one's listening to me,  but this place is falling apart.  It's falling apart.  They fired an S-load of people about six months ago  and they thought, ah, that won't affect anything.  And then time goes by  and the people that would do regular maintenance  and this and that, they're gone.  This place is falling apart.  Friday it was the phones.  Today it's Anthony's microphone.  Hopefully it'll last the whole show.  I'd hate to have it peter out on me. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  Sounds like a problem with the...  With the company.  ...wizzy dater in the...  Who's a majeure?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Well, keep saving money.  That'll...  That'll...  That'll...  That's the trick, right?  Everybody's broke, apparently.  Hi.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  The Monday edition.  The...  We'll, uh...  Talk a little louder  and give you a little more energy.  Oh, there's a shot.  Make him believe that 
[00:02:00]  we don't hate Mondays like you.  Get you up.  Yeah.  Going.  For that first day of the week.  Oh, Christ.  You know, this financial crisis,  they're a little worried about  how it's gonna be perceived  on Wall Street this morning, Anthony.  What about Main Street, Opie?  What about Main Street?  Yeah.  Yes, the perception on Wall Street.  I just want to know one thing.  Simple.  Because this thing affects everybody, right?  Sure.  Who's gonna be the guy  that goes on TV and goes, 
[00:02:30]  Okay, I know what everyone's been wondering.  Today's the day.  Run to your bank  and take all your money out.  Oh.  That's all I need to know.  The ultimate panic.  Right.  That will completely cause the downfall.  Because to me,  this is a lot of mumbo-jumbo.  I just need to know  when is the day  I have to clear out my accounts  and hide it somewhere.  Like, bury it  or bury it in a chest.  Well, you gotta...  And hope for the best.  You gotta have your money  in one of these reputable banks  that are buying up  all the other banks. 
[00:03:00]  That seems to be it.  I think you're not gonna get  the interest rate  you get on the other banks.  Right, right.  But at least you know  your cash will be there.  For the most part.  I'm happy to say  my money is in Ted's Bank.  So I should be okay.  Ted's Bank?  Yeah, they gave me  7% on my savings.  7%?  7%?  That Ted's crazy.  I'm in the money, my friends.  I am in the money.  7%.  7%, right.  Your money's safe  with us, Gregory.  Thank you, Ted.  Ted, the president 
[00:03:30]  of Ted's Bank.  He just happens to be here.  That's right.  I always stop in  to watch the show  on my way  and do my banking.  That way,  he can laugh  all the way to it.  I never thought of that.  That's very funny, Anthony.  That's only Ted  would think so.  Yeah, when that happens  and everybody  just pulls their money out  and it becomes worthless,  that'll be great.  I mean, I do my banking  in the back of a bodega.  Is that okay?  Oh, yeah, that sounds secure.  There's like a bulletproof window.  It seems secure to me. 
[00:04:00]  You're safe.  All right, good.  Money is not safe with them.  Can we just nominate one guy?  Like, I don't care who it is  to be the guy  that goes on TV  and goes,  Today's the day.  It's time.  Run to your bank.  It's time.  And take all your money out.  That's all I want to know.  That's all I want to know  in the end.  I'm sure there'd be  nice orderly lines  in front of the banks  just waiting  to get their money out.  Yeah.  How was your weekend, Anthony?  Oh, wonderful. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Just lovely.  I had the old  go over mom and sales  yesterday  because mom calls me up  and she goes,  Well, I haven't seen you in a while.  Why don't you come over?  And she goes,  It's not going to be a big thing.  You know,  Joe and the baby  will be there  and Dawn and the baby  and she kind of hinted like,  you know,  maybe you come over,  just hang out, 
[00:05:00]  you know,  no entourage  or anything.  What,  you bring an entourage  over to mom's house?  I don't bring an entourage.  It's just,  you know,  occasionally some friends  will pop by over there  and we'll hang out.  And it's directly because  there's no one  to talk to over there anymore.  Right.  It's just a whole nother animal.  So you need,  So mom then tells me,  look,  me and you will talk.  We'll hang out and talk.  It'll be fine.  It'll be nice.  Like,  okay.  So I go over there 
[00:05:30]  and I'm running,  you know,  I'm running solo.  So it's just me.  Go over there  and then the babies come over.  Dawn and Joe  and then the babies come over.  Nice,  right?  And my mother  was like a heroin addict.  She's trying so hard  to actually just talk to me.  But every two seconds,  you're like,  Oh,  look at that.  You ever notice  how the little faces  they make it?  I'm like,  all right,  you know,  go over there.  No,  no,  no.  I'm talking with you. 
[00:06:00]  I'm hanging out with you.  I'm doing.  And then every two seconds,  it's,  it's the babies,  the babies,  and she's over with the babies  and Joe with the baby  and my sister,  the babies,  the babies,  the babies,  the babies.  And then everybody's like,  Oh,  what's the matter?  You're not getting enough attention.  Like,  no,  it's not about the attention.  It's about the,  I want to be able to just hang out  and talk about adult things,  not go,  go,  gaga stuff all goddamn day.  You know what you should do?  Go over to mom,  mom and Sal's in a dress as an adult. 
[00:06:30]  I'll put a diaper on like an adult baby,  the stupid bonnet,  a rattle.  For some reason,  adult babies have to dress like babies  from the forties.  They can't dress like modern babies.  They need the old D style diapers  with the pins on the side  and a bonnet and a rattle.  Yeah.  And yeah,  I'll do that.  And maybe,  just crawl around mom's house  with some kind of,  yeah,  sucking device in your,  in your mouth.  And it's,  it's, 
[00:07:00]  it's just that there's no adult conversation going on.  There's nothing.  I sit with Sal and talk to him,  but how much of an adult conversation is that?  He's,  he's just as crazy.  So I wind up going there  and it's like,  okay,  here's more baby talk.  I love the little effers,  but I mean,  Christ.  Did you pick them up?  No.  Did you kiss them?  I gave them little kisses  on their little baby heads.  Nice.  Did you,  did you change them at all? 
[00:07:30]  No.  I'm not even close.  I don't even watch them get changed.  That's not your job.  Your job is just to spoil them.  My job is to just,  yeah,  spoil them.  I'm up to 10 or 11 nephews and nieces.  Not one diaper for me,  my friends.  But not even,  not even like spoil them yet.  Like now they're at the,  who cares phase.  Yeah.  Good.  Once they cook a little more,  then they're okay to like,  when they start pushing a year,  then you've got to get in there and be the cool uncle.  Oh yeah.  You know that.  They're all counting on you to be the cool uncle. 
[00:08:00]  Right now,  I don't care if they make a sound.  I had to listen for,  dude,  I'm,  I'm being,  I'm being modest here when I say a half hour.  I'm being a little conservative.  About how Joe's little baby Layla makes this squeaky sound.  And I'm sitting there going,  yeah,  yeah.  And in my head is like,  who the hell gives up?  What the hell kind of noise a baby makes? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah,  it's a baby noise.  And then my mother has to tell me,  and she makes this little screamy noise.  I'm like,  really?  That sounds annoying.  And she goes,  and my mother's like,  no,  no,  it's not like she's hurting or in pain noise or anything.  I was like,  that isn't what I meant.  She could be the happiest baby in the world.  Making a screamy noise.  I cringe at,  at loud baby noises.  And,  and,  and,  and it's all about just baby.  Where's the conversation about,  you know,  ah,  you know, 
[00:09:00]  drinking on the boat or the,  you know,  the good old days or something adult-like.  See,  those are adult conversations talking about what the children are doing.  You want to have like fun.  Let's,  let's talk about baseball and farts.  Right.  Why not?  That's what we were talking about a year ago.  You just want to talk about drunk driving.  Right.  Speeding and beating and loose women and drugs.  How many years I watched my brother hauling his,  uh,  amps in guitar in one hand, 
[00:09:30]  the amp in the other.  I'm like,  all right,  here's Joe.  We're doing it.  And then yesterday I hear the door open up with a little bit of trouble.  Cause there's some clanging going on at the door.  I turn and there's my brother who I,  for the past,  I don't know how many goddamn years I see him with a guitar and an amp in his  hand.  And he's got a baby and a play penny rolly thing.  I'm like,  this just blows.  You make a great point. 
[00:10:00]  It's just the babies.  The baby.  I get it.  The amount of stuff parents need for their kids is just amazing.  Oh,  it's just a God.  It's just,  but what's,  what's that all about?  Because when we were growing up,  I I'm convinced there wasn't that much stuff,  right?  No,  your mom didn't drag all that crap around baby seats and baby seats.  We didn't have baby seats growing up.  They had a baby seat.  I didn't even have a CD belt when I,  when I was in the car, 
[00:10:30]  my father's hand would like move around and hold you in place.  If you had to stop short.  Yeah.  Something like that.  That was it.  Yeah.  Some,  some drunk ants just holding you on the way to grandma's.  That was your baby seat.  The play pen didn't leave the house either.  No.  Like that thing was made of wood.  It was like weighed 800 pounds.  He would set up chairs or something to make a little corral for the kid.  You didn't,  you didn't bring your own play pen.  Now there's 8,000 thing.  He plops her in this little thing with toys dangling over all in mobile fashion. 
[00:11:00]  And there's things in front that go.  Grr.  Grr.  Chicka,  chicka,  chicka,  talk,  talk,  toot,  toot,  ring,  ring.  Shut up.  Can't you make these things quiet?  Can't they plug them in and put headphones on the toddler so only they can hear the noise?  Were you hungover when you went to mommy?  I,  yes.  It sounds like it might have been.  Yes.  All these little noises just bothering you.  It's a Sunday.  Of course I was.  Oh, 
[00:11:30]  I was out Saturday night.  Went to,  uh,  the,  uh,  mafia life party over there at the 40,  40 club.  Yeah.  How was that place?  Yo,  how was that?  It was a bunch of white people in a room with the management waiting for them to get out.  So the black people standing online could go in.  No,  why?  Because the black people are going to be spending the money at the 40,  40.  Excuse me?  That's what happens.  Really?  Yeah.  Because they all live like,  uh,  they're puffy.  Oh,  they get the bottles of champagne.  No joke.  They don't want to see whitey in those places.  Cause we're all like figuring out, 
[00:12:00]  you know,  how much,  how much money we're going to spend.  Those guys,  they,  they spend their whole freaking week salary in those joints.  Salary.  Cause they're,  yeah,  they're,  they think drug money's called.  Come on.  I saw the people standing out in front of the 40,  40 club.  They have no problem,  you know,  just spending every dime they got.  Yeah.  They want to like live like rap stars for a night.  I'm telling.  That's true.  I'm telling you,  but they wanted us out.  So then we went to a loonies,  hung out there,  toss a few back.  And then,  uh,  you know, 
[00:12:30]  it was home time.  Homeward bound.  Homeward bound.  Very good.  Was it?  Yeah.  The kid thing.  You're going to,  you're stuck with that for a while.  You should have one,  one yourself and then you'll fit in.  Please just have one yourself.  Just one.  Please,  please just make,  let me be sterile.  I just don't even,  there's nothing in my makeup,  my,  my,  my physical,  uh,  uh,  makeup,  my DNA,  any of that,  that ever wants me to have a kid.  I just am so dead set against having one of my own. 
[00:13:00]  I'll enjoy other people's every so often,  but I mean,  when the adults are in the room,  how about we have an adult conversation?  That isn't just about the goddamn babies,  babies,  babies,  babies.  That ain't happening.  I haven't had an adult conversation with my brother,  my,  my closest brother,  Scott,  cause we're closer to age and stuff for kids.  We haven't had an adult conversation in well over a decade.  That's all they talk about.  And it's who's carrying them.  And you want to hold them?  No, 
[00:13:30]  yeah,  I don't.  Did you hear?  Stop asking.  Did you,  did you get a lot of this?  Like you almost had eye contact with Joe or Dawn and,  and all of a sudden they're like,  and you're really getting into something like,  yeah,  look,  man,  I'm thinking of going into the program.  I really,  I had,  uh-huh,  uh-huh,  uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As they're sort of looking at you,  but uh-huh,  uh-huh.  Oh,  they got to look around.  Make sure the kid's not banging its head into anything.  You got to hear every little thing.  All my mother can do these days is go,  look how little the shoes are.  Everything's little.  Look at the shirt. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Isn't that adorable?  Oh,  look,  look,  Anthony,  he's looking at you.  He's looking at,  yeah,  great.  Cause I'm another big blob in the room.  That's all he sees.  He's not seeing grandma.  He's not seeing mommy and dad.  It's big blobs in the room that they see.  Moving blobs that attract his attention.  Moving her attention.  Moving blobs,  they're trying to figure out if they could eat you,  suckle off you.  What are you?  What are you and how can you help me?  Right,  what can I get off you? 
[00:14:30]  Oh,  maybe the stuff I need for my little life.  Can I point out the conversation that you,  you,  you,  yeah,  I know.  He,  he,  he,  he didn't even,  he didn't even know.  He's like,  maybe you're having a conversation.  Like,  hey,  look,  I'm thinking of going to the program.  Oh,  that's the chat.  He gives you,  I didn't even realize that.  Well,  I was coming up.  Well,  cause you try to have like these serious conversations with your siblings and you're like,  I'm,  I'm spilling my heart out here.  And you're,  you're giving me the aha,  aha,  aha,  as you're looking to see it,  you know, 
[00:15:00]  if the kid's not going to fall out a window or something.  An example.  I just want to talk maybe about,  uh,  you know,  guns,  you know,  my new laser sight or something,  things that my brothers find cool.  Used to find cool.  Things like that.  Right.  That ain't happening.  And then all of a sudden it's like,  uh,  Oh,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby.  And baby,  baby.  That's our conversation.  Oh yeah.  I picked up,  you know,  a SIG 556.  It's great,  man.  I got a,  a,  a,  a scope on it.  And I went baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby, 
[00:15:30]  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby.  What?  What are you saying?  Baby,  baby,  baby.  And then my mother comes up,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby,  baby.  Ah,  what about my guns?  What about Sal?  You forgot the Baltimore baby,  baby,  baby,  how little his shoes are.  Let's see.  You're lucky,  man.  You're,  I mean,  you know,  it's the baby thing's finally hitting your family.  Finally.  I know they're in their eighties.  Why are they having kids? 
[00:16:00]  It usually hits,  you know,  in late twenties.  I'm talking about like you as a bystander,  early thirties.  Maybe I got accustomed to it then because they were so long without any kids.  You got off lucky.  And it was just all us hanging out,  talking about funny stuff.  Is it true?  Your mom's going to have another kid because she's really getting into this.  Wow.  She just announced it.  Yeah.  My mother,  is having a kid.  And so is my grandma.  Yeah.  Who's in the nursing home.  She's going to be squirting one out.  Well,  hers isn't playing though.  Yeah.  Oh,  it's biracial. 
[00:16:30]  It's biracial.  It looks,  it looks like the night watchman.  Hey,  we got to take our first break,  but Jim's down and dirty on HBO.  Come on people.  I'm sure a lot of people took a peek,  right?  Jimmy.  I don't know.  I have no,  I won't know numbers until the end of this week.  And you got three more on HBO,  Friday night at midnight.  Actually,  it was very good,  Jimmy.  I enjoyed it.  I finally watched it last night.  I taped it.  It's on demand tonight.  It wasn't on demand.  And I see you got luggage.  You're off to what?

[00:18:00]  But they're always polite too.  Like,  I'll be right back.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  So it's different when,  yeah.  And then they forget what they're talking about or,  or,  or some other relative in the house will say something.  Just cut me right off.  Cut me right off with my adult oriented conversation.  That's why I just got to invite,  you know,  my mom and Sal over my house.  So my mom could fall out of the hot tub.  And injure herself.  Yeah,  but you're going to do the same thing to her though. 
[00:18:30]  She's going to try to,  she's going to try to have an adult conversation with you.  And you're going to be watching all your babies and making sure they don't.  Oh,  is that it?  Making sure they could sure junior high school girls are drowning in my pool.  Make,  making sure they don't do a little do too much.  If you know what I mean,  that mom would come up.

Guilty of assault with a deadly weapon.  Count eleven.  Coercionally.  All right.  They're still reading off the guilty,  uh,  sounds for OJ.  OJ,  apparently very guilty.  Ooh.  We finally got him,  right guys?  Yeah.  I knew it.  I knew it.  That's what Whitey says today.  Yeah.  Finally.  No outrage either. 
[00:21:00]  Nah.  No outrage.  Yeah,  there is a whole thing going on here.  Well,  I told Anthony in the office,  I'm like,  you know why they got,  uh,  OJ guilty finally?  They're,  they're,  they're preparing us for a black president.  They're like,  okay,  this is what Whitey needs.  They need,  they need something in return.  It's a,  it's always a give and take,  uh,  black,  uh,  black and white,  right?  Yeah.  So like,  all right,  we got this OJ trial going on and it's 13 years to the day.  Let's,  let's,  let's throw him in jail forever.  And that'll make Whitey happy. 
[00:21:30]  And then we could like,  we could like slide the black president past them.  We can't have an OJ acquittal and a black president too much.  So we'll give you,  we'll,  we'll throw you a bone.  We'll put OJ in prison.  Uh,  but you know,  you got to deal with the black president.  They sacrificed the OJ.  Was he acquitted 13 years ago?  Huh?  13 years ago to the day.  It was to the day.  To the day.  How was that that long ago?  I know.  Well, 
[00:22:00]  well,  I'll let you know the earth went around the sun 13 times.  That's how it happened,  Jim.  Oh,  yeah.  Oh,  365 day increments.  Right.  I see.  That makes perfect sense.  Now it does.  It does.  Stupid OJ.  Why?  You got away with murder,  with murder,  which,  you know,  double,  it's a term people use a lot.  Yeah.  That guy gets,  he gets away with murder.  That guy,  Oh,  he got away with murder.  Yeah.  And they usually mean nothing.  Yeah.  He got away with murder. 
[00:22:30]  Double murder,  as Jim put it.  Yeah.  He got killed two people.  Let's not,  I don't care what the jury said.  You know,  even though he was acquitted,  it doesn't mean he didn't do it.  It means the state didn't prove that he,  he,  he did it beyond a reasonable doubt,  but we all know he killed two people.  Well,  the other case,  let's get that out of the way.  The other case said he,  he did do that.  Yes.  Oh,  Jimmy's moving in.  There were blood splatters all over the place.  Oh my God.  Jimsy.  Hi Jimsy.  It was a double murder. 
[00:23:00]  You think when one of Quincy's friends did something and got away with it,  even though it wasn't murder,  he'd say,  Oh,  he gets away with murder.  Does he use that whole,  uh,  probably a little phrase.  He's been getting away with murder for a long time.  Jimsy.  He just uses the word murder because he likes it.  Oh,  geez.  The glove didn't fit.  When,  when Quincy's favorite sports team really went big over the last, 
[00:23:30]  uh,  over,  over their opponent,  you must say,  they murdered him.  He just loves that word for anything.  It was murder.  Murder.  Uh,  let's say hi to John on Long Island.  John.  Hey,  how are you doing?  Good,  John.  Yeah,  listen,  I got it.  I got it.  I got a thing that throw into Opie's,  uh,  equation there.  Yeah.  Obama gets elected when he takes office in January.  He can pardon OJ immediately. 
[00:24:00]  He doesn't want to though.  He's got to make Whitey happy.  Oh,  that'd be a wow.  Would that be a football?  That'd be a,  his first,  the first thing he does.  Yes,  sir.  Anthony,  I appreciate your sanctioning phone call Thursday.  Hmm.  What are you talking about?  I guess he's talking about,  you'll be hearing from me on Thursday.  Bye bye.  I guess he's talking about a replay.  He must have a replay.  I love those things.  How they confuse people.  So yeah.  Uh,  OJ though,  that's OJ.  It's like, 
[00:24:30]  what a dummy.  It's like you cut your wife's throat and you stabbed another guy.  Lay low.  Yeah.  Chill.  As they say.  Yeah.  Be a good boy.  How about you don't get into the,  cause this chick he was dating,  this blonde he had over the last 10 years,  domestic spats with.  Oh yeah.  Uh,  fights with his daughter that ended up with him like bleeding from the head.  Yeah.  Like his daughter beats him up.  Like,  OJ is just an idiot.  Yeah.  And,  and his,  uh,  his blonde girlfriend that looked just like, 
[00:25:00]  uh,  the one he killed there.  Uh,  yeah,  you know,  constant 911 calls and she's out with a Pedro Guerrero.  They're doing cocaine.  Really?  OJ.  Why don't you just hang out?  You had a good man.  Here's a,  let's go back 13 years.  Remember this.  We,  the jury in the above entitled action,  find the defendant or,  or in thought,  James Simpson,  not guilty of the crime of murder in violation of penal code.  Section one 87, 
[00:25:30]  a felony upon Nicole Brown Simpson,  a human being as charged in count.  One of the information.  Wow.  Happier days there,  OJ.  Huh?  In the above entitled case,  find the defendant,  Ornthal James Simpson,  as follows.  Count one conspiracy to commit a crime.  Guilty.  Count three conspiracy to commit kidnapping.  Guilty.  Yeah.  Count three conspiracy to commit robbery.  Guilty.  Come on.  Count four,  burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon.  Guilty.  A burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon.  Count five first degree kidnapping.  That's the big deadly weapon. 
[00:26:00]  First degree kidnapping with a weapon.  That was the big one.  And when they announced that,  that's where he went like,  I needed that one.  He winced.  That was the one he needed.  Yeah.  Because the recording,  he made them sit,  right?  That is technically,  I don't like the fact that,  what?  I don't like the fact that they got him.  I'm actually on OJ's side on this one.  Some scumbag memorabilia dealer.  He went to get his stuff back.  You can't go with a gun.  You know what though?  The only way you should deal with those guys.  You can't go with a gun. 
[00:26:30]  Really?  Babe Ruth signed that with a brand new,  I can still smell the Sharpie ink.  Really?  Did he?  Give me my stuff back,  scumbag.  I understand those people aren't on the up and up,  but you can't go to a hotel room with a gun demanding your stuff back.  Hold people against their will in a room like that.  It's a kidnapping.  And it's all premeditated,  first degree,  because he had this whole plan that he hatched out with these other guys.  He just is a dummy.  He thinks he's a criminal mastermind because he got away with two counts of murder with evidence all over the place. 
[00:27:00]  He's doing a little Mission Impossible there.  He's crazy.  And this,  if you ask me,  shows a personality of someone that is completely capable of murdering two people.  Like this just bolsters the case when you say,  OJ did it.  And people go,  oh no he didn't.  Look what he did.  Look at how he follows it up.  He had 13 good years on the outside,  which he shouldn't have had.  Yeah.  And now hopefully they throw him away in prison. 
[00:27:30]  Look at the phone.  It'll rot there.  Not even lit.  No one's outraged.  No one is outraged about the OJ.  And they're saying life in prison now?  He's 61.  Yeah.  Even if he does like 20,  he's done,  right?  No bail.  He's locked up.  We'll be sentenced December 5th.  He's done.  I don't think he's going to get life  because that's too much like a payback for the other one  and they're probably afraid it'll be overturned.  I bet you he gets,  I bet you he gets 20 to 25 and he'll probably do 10.  That's my guess.  Maybe a little more.  I don't know the legal system out there.  That's pretty much his life, 
[00:28:00]  Jimmy.  71-year-old OJ.  OJ's falling apart now.  Yeah,  that's pretty much,  that'll be his life.  That'll be his life.  He get out,  dude,  he does 10 years,  he gets out,  he's 71 years old.  Um,  you know,  he lives till he's 80.  Maybe he get a little comeback going at 71 in the NFL.  That'd be cool.  What if he,  um,  like I know,  obviously the whole double jeopardy thing,  he can't be tried for the crime again,  can't,  but what if he confessed to it? 
[00:28:30]  Like,  like in order to get a lesser,  like if they say,  look,  you just fess up.  How cool.  To what you did.  Cause we all need to give a complete written confession with all the details.  And we'll,  we'll cut you some slack on this one.  Yeah.  Did you hit your hammer really hard with a hammer?  So it was nice and swollen.  So the glove wouldn't fit your hammer with a hammer.  I mean,  your,  your,  your hand,  your hand with a hammer,  the dress,  the dress,  something about a hammer,  a hammer.  Yeah.  Did you take a hammer to your hand?  So it's all swollen. 
[00:29:00]  So the glove wouldn't fit.  I want to hear every detail to know.  And this Fred Goldman,  you hear about him?  Like they're saying they're already looking at the prison he might be going to.  And,  and what kind of things,  you know,  and,  and they're saying that OJ would be allowed to work for about 84 cents an hour.  And Fred Goldman's lawyer is already on it.  Like,  Oh,  we'll take that too.  We'll take it.  We'll take that 84 cents.  Fred Goldman is,  he wants to,  he wants to bite OJ's throat. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not happy.  He's probably not happy that he'll be in prison.  Like,  think about it.  We were always saying that if,  if a Fred goes to the doctor one day and is diagnosed with a terminal disease,  how he's just going to kill OJ.  Yeah.  And now he's going to be hard to get because he's behind bars.  Wait,  they're still reading the cast.  Guilty of robbery with use of a deadly weapon.  This has been going on all morning.  Assault with a deadly weapon.  Bruce Froman.  Guilty of assault with a deadly weapon.  Count 10.  Assault with a deadly weapon.  Alfred Beardsley. 
[00:30:00]  Guilty of assault with a deadly weapon.  Yeah.  It just keeps going.  We'll,  we'll keep checking in.  Who is this Alfred Beardsley?  Alfred Beardsley.  What an awful name.  He's one of Harry Potter's teachers.  How do you go up to a girl and say,  hi,  I'm Alfred Beardsley.  You want to go out for a drink?  Yes.  My friend,  uh,  Pete mustachioed myself.  Beardsley.  I'd like to take you to,  uh,  Bill's Whiskers Emporium.  Emporium.  There's always an Emporium.  Throw back a few sudsies with some shaving cream.  This guy's all about the facial hair.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  Have you ever been to an Emporium?  I live in Emporium.  You love the Emporium.  Food Emporium.  This guy loves beard hair.  He's all about it.  He certainly does.  He's Beardsley.  You know why?  Because he has face eczema.  He has an itchy face.  Like when he shaves,  it's all scaly.  His face and neck.  Beardsley.  So that was some,  some big news.  Yeah.  And,  and I also think you won't see any outrage on the part of the black community. 
[00:31:00]  Uh,  because of the Obama situation.  Uh,  I think,  um,  uh,  like black people,  leaders,  these alleged black leaders are keeping quiet.  If you notice,  keeping quiet these days.  They don't want any trouble.  So Whitey looks and goes,  Oh,  look what they're up to again.  They want,  you know,  batting down the hatches until after the election.  And also,  uh,  the case against him is strong.  And there's a,  there's a recording of him going,  don't move. 
[00:31:30]  Videotape.  You can't argue it.  It's like,  yeah,  I couldn't argue the other one,  but the case was strong.  Yeah.  13 years ago.  Of course.  His blood's mixed in with the victim's blood.  His shoe prints.  It's everything.  Dennis Fung didn't handle the evidence.  Like,  Oh,  Jim C.  Jim C.  I don't understand.  I would have put it in a part in my hair.  I'm telling you,  they gave us this one.  They're getting us ready for Obama.  I'm telling you.  If,  uh,  Jim C.,  if you ever run out of,  uh,  slides that you put under the microscope when you smear something on it, 
[00:32:00]  you could just use,  uh,  your flat girlfriend's ass and,  uh,  slide that under the microscope.  That's why I like her ass.  Reminds me of a Petri dish.  I leave little samples on it.  If you know what I mean,  Sam.  We know,  Jim C.  You dirty dog.  After you go to the punk rock concert.  Yes,  those punk rockers,  they,  they spit on my members only jacket.  Members only.  There was a girl, 
[00:32:30]  Abigail Folger.  She's bleeding from the throat on a grate.  There's coffee grinds on Charles Manson fingernails,  Sam.  God damn,  I gotta watch some Quincy.  I own season one and two.  I just can't,  I haven't been sick enough.  Right.  To make myself sit on the couch.  There's so much,  so many other things to watch before you throw in Quincy.  M.E.  Bubonic plague and I just can't get up.  We got the Quincy zombie killer episode. 
[00:33:00]  We got the Quincy zombie killer episode.  Our favorite clips.  They're lovely.  They're wonderful.  Really quick.  You think we're all zombie killers?  You're the killers.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  You're a whole sick society.  Society.  We're just your lousy escape goat.  Escape goat.  Escape.  An escape goat.  Sam the man puts the emphasis on the wrong part of the word.  It was murder. 
[00:33:30]  Now we gotta look for an escaped goat.  An escape goat.  And apparently it's eating newspapers and things all over town.  It's making duty on the rug.  An escape goat.  Billy.  Billy.  Tried to eat my girlfriend's ass.  Thought it was a newspaper. 
[00:34:00]  I like to put the back legs of the goat in my boots.  And watch it try to run away, Sam.  I put a little blonde wig over his hiney and pretend he's Jane Mansfield.  What a douche.  Quincy is a stoop.  We gotta go through another episode of Quincy.  Because the zombie killer one was great.  Do you have his little speech in the zombie killer part? 
[00:34:30]  It's so great.  E-Rock could find it.  It's the lamest rave party ever.  It's horrid.  It's a punk rock club.  Punk rock club.  There's a punk band up there.  There's nothing punk about them or the audience.  The punks.  I mean, Quincy's gotta talk to them.  He's gotta get through to them.  Yeah.  And this is how...  There's a generation gap there.  Yeah, man.  How's Quincy gonna pull this one off?  So the coroner walks up.  I need your attention.  Silence.  Yeah.  That works.  Yeah.  Oh, he's the coroner.  We gotta listen.  Hey, you stop biting Nancy Spongen's face. 
[00:35:00]  I'm gonna make an announcement.  I'm gonna make an announcement.  Going backwards.  Here's how SNL handled the O.J. thing.  O.J. Simpson was found guilty Friday on charges of armed robbery, assault, and kidnapping, but  really murder.  That's what really murder was.  Yeah, we finally got him.  Whitey always wins in the end.  That's right.  See what happens? 
[00:35:30]  Whitey's in charge of the system.  That's right.  It might take time.  That's right.  But all the loose ends are tied up in the end, nice and tightly.  Don't mess with Whitey.  Exactly.  Oh, they're still going on.  Alternative to count five.  Guilty.  Alternative to count five.  Count 12.  Oh, they continue with the guilties.  How many guilties were there?  It's like they got him on real estate speculation.  He on tape had a pistol.  Yo, don't move.  What a dope.  You know that stuff that he was trying to get back is now worth a bloody fortune? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  And Fred Goldman knows that.  His lawyer's on top of that stuff, too.  Oh, yeah.  It was pretty much crap, but now that it's part of this trial and all that, now the value  is ridiculous.  I wonder if he does coke or something like that.  Why would your judgment be that?  He's not a retarded.  He's a freaking animal.  The guy has this animalistic mentality that he hid for so many years by being the funny  guy, the nice guy.  Go, OJ, go.  And it turns out the guy's just a freaking nut. 
[00:36:30]  You think he had a little blob of pudding next to him as a little commemoration, a little  memory of Johnny Cochran?  Oh, my God.  That's what he had.  He had like a little, a fancy little wine, like a little margarita glass filled with pudding  with a bad fake mustache under it.  He came in a hat and a little hat right next to him full of pudding.  It was bad taste that they wheeled in the coffin of Johnny Cochran.  Trying to get something going. 
[00:37:00]  Because OJ doesn't know how to.  They exhume him and just sit him in the chair.  Like Weekend at Birdies.  Yeah.  If it does not fit, you close the lid.  It doesn't rhyme.  It doesn't matter.  It's Johnny Cochran.  Okay.  Not guilty.  Whitey got him too, man, for doing the wrong thing.  See?  See what Whitey does?  Whitey put some stuff in his food, gave him a brain tumor.  That's right.  That's it.  Who else is dead there?  Kardashian.  Kardashian, yeah.  That's it.  See?  Everything gets tied up.  That's right.  Whitey's in everything. 
[00:37:30]  It's the Illuminati.  Don't mess with Whitey.  Ah, we got the Quincy talking to the kids.  His speech.  Love his speech.  It's so awful.  There's a girl I'm concerned with.  It's so awful.  Why is the coroner doing this?  I don't know.  He's supposed to stay in his office, cut up bodies, and say, oh, this is what he died  of.  And straddle the hot ones and try to jump off when he hears the door open.  That's what creepy Quincy does.  Creep.  What a ghoul.  You think he practices that move?  I think I could get off a body in a half a second if I had to. 
[00:38:00]  He has Sam walk in on him.  All right, Sam, do it again.  Yeah.  I want you to surprise me five or six times today.  You know what it is?  Mr. Astin noticed.  Hey, how come there's half and half on a lot of the backs of the cadaver?  I was drinking coffee.  Half and half.  Quincy tries to talk to the kids at a punk rock club.  Sure, he does.  But he has to get through the punk club manager.  Yeah.  He's got to convince the guy to let him go on stage and talk to the kids.  The coroner. 
[00:38:30]  We need your help.  I want to go on stage for two minutes and talk to the kids.  Maybe you'd like to take over to the opening act.  You paint a target on your head, I might arrange it.  I want to find an innocent girl.  Girl.  Girl.  You don't find anybody innocent here.  It's just too much to ask for a few minutes to try to save a life.  Hey.  Be my guest.  But if you expect any of these kids to the cast, you've got to be a guest.  It's horrible.  Go ahead.  It should be fun.  It's not punk.  It's terrible.  But TV has to be safe, so they have their own version of punk music. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's like an obscure Blue Oyster Cult song, it sounds like.  And they're making believe it's punk.  Because the audience was a bit older.  Oh, they wouldn't have been able to take punk day to turn the channel.  I couldn't watch Quincy last night.  That music.  You can't play, like, the Stooges or any of the other, you know, back then.  A little Gigi Allen.  Yeah.  Open up, Quincy.  Here's a chocolate treat for you.  Here's a banana for you.  Spin somewhere.  He used to love that gag.  I love a chocolate-dipped banana, Gigi. 
[00:39:30]  Thank you very much.  The best part about this.  Gigi's hosing down the crowd.  What an odd way to carry it.  The best part about this is Quincy gets up there, and like Jimmy pointed out, it's a punk rock club.  They're a bunch of rebels.  They go listen to authority.  Listen how close they start listening.  Of course.  If that makes sense.  Right.  Bad music goes off, and they all just stop and listen.  Please.  Can I be a gesture?  Please.  It's very important. 
[00:40:00]  It's like they just picked up the needle on the record.  How can a band stop like that?  There's seven people in the audience?  Yeah, there was no one there.  It's just terrible.  We need your help.  I want to go on stage for two minutes and talk to the kids.  Two minutes.  Maybe you'd like to take over to the opening act.  You paint a target on your head, I might arrange it.  I want to find an innocent girl.  You don't find anybody innocent here.  No, it's just too much to ask for a few minutes to try to save a life. 
[00:40:30]  Hey, be my guest.  But if you expect any of these kids to help you, you better.  Sorry about that.  No, no, I didn't mind hearing it again, because I was enjoying the club manager's warnings.  Yeah.  Paint a target on your head.  Yeah.  Why?  Do they know who to fire douchey lines at?  Please.  Can I be a gesture?  Please.  It's very important.  Thank you.  How many of you know Abigail Garvin?  And all of you know that the police are looking for in connection with a murder that happened 
[00:41:00]  right here in front of this stage.  Now, all the charges against her have been dropped.  She's innocent.  If she comes back, nothing will be done to her.  Why should we believe you?  If I knew who that girl was, I sure as hell wouldn't tell a cop.  Because that's all you are, man.  It's a dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  Sticks and stones may break my bones.  He kind of cares, huh?  He kind of cares.  I don't care what you call me.  I don't care.  When you say that, you kind of care. 
[00:41:30]  I don't care if you call me Creepy Queer the Coroner, like they all do back home.  I don't care if you call me Colonel of Corn Teeth.  I don't care if you call me the pederast with the flat-ass girlfriend.  What's your uniform?  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  I don't care if you call me Sam's Bottom.  I don't care if you call me the coroner who suckled on Lieutenant Monaghan.  The names I picked up. 
[00:42:00]  He just admits everything to the punk rock crowd.  I don't care if you call me a necrophiliac.  But we weren't saying that, Quinn.  Dog without a uniform.  I don't care what kind of names you call me.  I'm only interested in helping Abby.  My throat is scratchy.  I wonder why.  Cancel.  I actually didn't.  That's funny.  Like I can't talk for long.  For some reason my throat hurts.  I constantly feel like I need to swallow.  And then it continues. 
[00:42:30]  Look, we have reason to believe that she's with Zach's real murderer, Molly Howard.  And Molly is trying to push her into a codeine overdose.  So please, if you have any information.  So please, if you have any information.  That was edgy.  That was edgy for the 70s.  Yeah.  A codeine overdose.  She's crushing up St. Joseph's children's aspirin and sprinkling him in her Diet Coke.  She slipped her a Flintstones chewable.  I think it was a Wilma. 
[00:43:00]  So please, if you have any information.  That's a crock, mister.  You think we're all zombie killers.  You're the killers.  You're a whole sick society.  That's who's guilty, man.  We're just your lousy scapegoat.  Besides, man, who the hell cares?  Yeah.  Yeah, who cares?  Oh, boy.  Quincy has to walk off.  Dejected.  Yeah.  It's also being pointed out.  When the music stops, no one boos.  They're just like, oh, it's hard to listen. 
[00:43:30]  Older man.  I'm a fake punk.  I'm a fake.  Oh, forget it.  Older gentleman.  All right.  I could listen to that one clip.  I love it.  If we mind this, do you understand the goal we'd find?  In this series.  That was just a random find.  Yeah, we got to find.  Yeah, there's got to be tons of clips like that.  We keep playing the same one.  Of him just being an ass.  We got to get another episode in.  On possession of a deadly weapon.  Oh, they're still going here, right?  Guilty.  Burglar while in possession of a deadly weapon.  Count five.  First degree kidnapping. 
[00:44:00]  He's banging like some eight and a half.  How does he bang anybody?  Who would have sex with a creepy older man?  The creepy old coroner.  Yeah.  His fingers smell like formaldehyde.  He's always on stolen jewelry.  Lockets with different people's relatives.  He's always giving girls gifts.  It's like a watch with a blonde hair in it.  Who's in this?  I bought it.  Pulled it off the victim.  There's a speckle of blood on the face.  He just takes the corpse's stuff and gives it out and gets chicks that way. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, that's beautiful.  I bought you a pair of underwear.  It's ripped, obviously.  It's in an evidence bag.  Somebody spilled cranberry juice on it.  Sweet.  Clint Eastwood rules.  Don't mind where they swabbed the crotch.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We're late.  The ghoul.  He's the worst. 
[00:45:00]  He sure is.  I'm obsessed with them.  Oh, totally.  Let's see if they're done with the guilties yet.  Guilty of robbery with a deadly weapon.  Count nine.  Assault with a deadly weapon.  Bruce Froman.  Guilty of a...  Oh, boy.  They're continuing there.  Keep going.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Mm-hmm.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Say hi to Rich in Maryland.  Rich.  Hey, what's up?  How are you, Rich?  Pretty good.  Hey, y'all. 
[00:45:30]  Catch the Kimbo Slice fight.  I saw the Kimbo Slice fight live.  I was down in Philadelphia this weekend and hanging out with the Philly crew.  And the Kimbo Slice fight comes on.  And one of the guys goes, can you imagine if this guy, you know, wins?  And we're all laughing like, shut up.  If you don't know, Kimbo Slice fought in that dumb league.  It's on CBS, though, huh?  And Kimbo Slice is the big star.  And Kimbo Slice got knocked out in the first, what, 20 seconds?  There, Rich? 
[00:46:00]  I think it was about 14 seconds.  14 seconds, right?  Okay.  Yeah, good stuff.  And he was a replacement fighter because Kimbo Slice was supposed to fight Ken Shamrock.  Rumor has it that Ken Shamrock wasn't even going to fight.  It was just a way to get some interest going.  And then this guy steps in last second.  And everyone was thinking, Kimbo Slice is going to destroy this dude.  14 seconds into the fight, this guy hits him with a right, right, right, right on the chin, right?  Yeah.  And nailed him.  And this guy really threw a punch because the guy was backed up against the fence. 
[00:46:30]  And he put his right leg up to kind of keep Kimbo at bay.  And his right arm was already half extended.  And then he just kind of flicked his forearm from the elbow.  Boom.  Like, it was not even a full wind-up punch.  This guy's a strong.  Hit him right on that stupid beard.  Just the power.  And this should be the end of Kimbo Slice, proving that, you know, he's a great street brawler.  But, you know, he has no business being in the ring with these guys.  The guy he fought is an ultimate fighter, obviously. 
[00:47:00]  And he knows what he's doing in there.  He knew he had to get Kimbo Slice, keep Kimbo Slice at bay, keep the distance.  And then he was able to nail him with this right.  He'll get one more fight.  Because anybody can get – that's how they'll look at it.  Like, anybody can get caught.  Yeah.  He wasn't trained to fight this guy.  This guy was a last-minute replacement.  This is what they'll say.  You know what I mean?  The guy's style with Kimbo.  Oh, I didn't know his style.  I didn't, yeah.  Slice went down, man.  He was out cold before he hit the ground.  And then, you know, he got beat up pretty good. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  In 14 seconds, fight over.  Unbelievable.  That's almost easier than, like, getting your ass beaten for a round and a half.  And just – you know, this was just a guy caught him on the jaw of the shot.  Kimbo looks like every Discovery Channel version of Neanderthal man.  Yeah.  He has got just a wild man look about him.  Like the guy that tried to put Bugs Bunny in the big black pot when Bugs Bunny was – and 
[00:48:00]  tried to cook him.  What about that chest hair, man?  Yeah, the chest hair thing.  He must have had – he shaves, like, his whole chest except for one peck.  I wonder why.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  It's his thing.  It's his gimmick.  His gimmick's falling down and getting punched in the face now.  Yeah.  That punch – but the guy just flicks his forearm.  Yeah, it didn't take much.  It was not a full wind-up punch.  Imagine the strength this guy has to knock you out by not even, you know, giving you a  full punch.  Got a glass chin.  Thanks, Rich.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Here's the whole fight. 
[00:48:30]  And it's about to get serious.  Slice quickly across.  Slice goes down.  Slice in trouble.  Oh, my goodness.  Slice gets pounded out.  And they stop it.  Rocky.  Rocky is here.  Seth Petroselli shocks the world.  Calm down.  The guy did shock the world because no one knew about this.  Oh, my God.  No one knew about this guy.  It's the number one video on YouTube, by the way, so people had interest in this thing. 
[00:49:00]  Let me tell you, Elite XC, if that's the end of Kimbo, you are in a bit of trouble.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, right?  Oh, boy.  That was their big name.  Oh, yeah, it was.  You know, Dana White probably has a lump on his head from hitting the ceiling during –  Can we try to get Dana White on the phone today so he could kind of gloat?  Yeah, dude, Dana's got to be very, very –  Didn't he say that Kimbo is really overestimated?  Everybody's been saying that.  All the guys that know this ultimate fighting game have been saying that. 
[00:49:30]  They're like, don't buy into the hype.  The guy knows how to fight in a street, but in a ring, it's a different story.  That guy – just think of how the guy that won feels that he got in the ring with Kimbo  Slice and everything that must have been going through his head beforehand, and then  he walks away going, I didn't even get touched.  I didn't even get touched by this guy.  How about, I wasn't even supposed to fight today, and now everybody knows me.  Not even supposed to be here.  Kimbo Slice got beat up by a guy with pink hair and a pink mouthpiece. 
[00:50:00]  Ooh, that hurts.  Let's go to Chrissa in New Jersey.  Chrissa.  Hey.  Hi, Chrissa.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  And I don't want to make a total hole of myself, but I just wanted to reassure Anthony that  there is hope for the future.  One of the best quotes I ever saw was in a parenting magazine written by –  Work is freedom?  What's that?  Nothing.  Sorry.  And just gave my husband a little bit of hope when we had our kids. 
[00:50:30]  You know, women get all mushy-gushy and love them, and he didn't understand quite what  the hype was.  And for guys, he said they start to get interesting once they're smarter than the dog.  Ah, okay.  Yeah, once they're smarter than the dog.  My husband.  No, you know, that's when it changes.  Yeah, because up until then, they have a lot in common.  They just drool.  They just need cleaned up.  You pick up their, you know, poop.  I didn't.  And after they're smarter than the dog, give them a year, maybe two, depending on your kid, 
[00:51:00]  and then they start to get interesting once they start to appreciate your charm a little  bit.  These kids are a waste for the first nine months.  I don't even acknowledge them or pick them up, but then after nine months, I'm all in.  Then I'm really into it.  Exactly.  I can see why moms, you know, were just genetically made, because we've got to ensure that they  survive that long.  But the guys, not a whole lot of reason to get interested until later.  Thank you, Krista.  I think Ant, when he was talking about seeing his two nephews, wait, a nephew and a niece. 
[00:51:30]  It's a niece and a nephew.  A nephew and a niece over the weekend.  You made a great point where everyone thinks the baby is looking at you.  Yeah.  I've never heard that before, and it's brilliant.  I'm going to take that one with me.  It's just blobs in the room.  Blobs in the room.  That mean nothing to them.  Colorful blobs in the room that just make weird noises, and sometimes they'll smile at  the noise.  Sometimes they'll cry at the noise.  Right.  But to them, look, he's looking at you.  I think he likes you.  What? 
[00:52:00]  It's a blob.  He's looking at a blob.  Yeah.  His eyes are rolling around like he's coming down off a heroin bender.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.  Oh.  Just wondering if you're some kind of food source.  Exactly the words I was thinking of.  You're a food source or you're not.  Yeah, that's all they think.  You know when people's kids get cool?  When you can drink with them.  That's pretty much it.  Right when they're seven.  My nephews, a couple of nephews there, they get all the, you know, they go to college,  drinking age, and they can have a couple of beers with them, and you hear funny stories 
[00:52:30]  about, you know, who they're screwing and beer plonging and all that.  Yeah.  I got one of those.  It's fun.  It's kind of depressing.  I used to go down to Florida and take him to SeaWorld and hold his little hand, and now  he's talking about, exactly, going on cruises and how they snuck the booze onto the ship  and, you know, road tripping.  Right.  To watch gator games and beer pong and fraternities, and I'm like, I used to hold your hand at  SeaWorld.  What the hell is going on?  You were supposed to never grow up. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  It's depressing as hell.  Yeah, there's pictures of a couple of my cousins and stuff, and they're at Disney World with  their parents holding their hands.  Getting a picture with Mickey Mouse.  And, like, the last time I think we went, they were already older, and they're just walking  around going, this sucks.  All right, we're going over here.  Hang out with my parents.  Must be tough for the parents at that point, though.  Of course. 
[00:53:30]  Like, oh, we're trying to squeeze out one more year of memories here at Happiest Place  on Earth.  The kids, screw this.  Go to Pledger Island to get a drink.  It really does have to suck to be parents, because for a lot of their life, you can't  do no wrong.  It's like, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy.  And then they turn on you.  These bastards turn on you and don't want anything to do with you.  That's got to be so depressing if you're a parent.  Put all that work into it, and then what?  It just leaves.  Or it does something even worse, gets in trouble. 
[00:54:00]  Or even worse, it kills you.  That's always a fun one.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  Yeah, I raised them, fed them, did everything, and then it comes back and stabs me for crack  money.  How weird is that, that you could possibly raise your own killer?  Yeah.  Fantastic to think that.  I'll tell you what, here's what having kids is.  Watch 12 Angry Men.  And it's Lee J. Cobb as he breaks down at the end and crumples up his son's picture.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  You have this silent rage for your awful children. 
[00:54:30]  Let's go to Yonkers and say hi to John.  He's still on the Kimbo thing.  What's up, John?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  What's up?  This isn't a first time Kimbo lost.  If you do a Google on Sean Gannon versus Kimbo Slice, it's a long fight.  Yeah.  Sean Gannon knocks him out.  Yeah, all the UFC fans, ultimate fighting fans in general, they've been arguing this  Kimbo Slice thing for a while.  And he wasn't that impressive Saturday night.  I became convinced that Kimbo's obviously a really good fighter, but just on that professional 
[00:55:00]  level, when Liddell was in, and I think I asked him to talk about Kimbo, and he's like,  gosh, he wasn't bad-mouthing.  It was just a genuine lack of concern about how to fight him.  Or frustrated at the popularity of Kimbo Slice.  They're like, come on, we all know that he's not that great.  You wouldn't want to fight him in an alley or anything.  No, this is an underground fight.  It's not an MMA.  It's underground.  It's 30 minutes.  Yeah, I understand what you're saying, John. 
[00:55:30]  Thank you.  I've seen that fight.  Yeah.  So how long?  Thank you, John.  You're out.  Thanks, John.  Thanks, John.  Thank you, John.  Tina Fey doing a good job.  She looks just like her.  The Sarah Palin thing on SNL.  She's getting used to doing the character, I think.  She's not even on SNL anymore.  She just decides to, what, come back?  Is she still a writer?  No, nothing.  She was nothing. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I guess she just comes back because it's kind of popular.  Well, the ratings are ridiculous just because Tina Fey's doing Sarah Palin.  Yeah.  That's the only reason, by the way.  Offer her five or six million, I think, for a book deal.  Yeah, she's like a five or six million dollar book deal on the team.  Wow.  But if McCain wins, it'll probably be even more.  Well, they got Palin.  I'm supporting that.  Obama's lead is growing at this point because of the economy.  They keep saying because of the economy and because of the economy.  Yeah.  And Palin, she's going right at him now.  And some say it's a bit of desperation. 
[00:56:30]  I'm just saying that.  Yeah.  You know, they got Palin as kind of the pit bull now.  Well, they said they've taken the weekend to kind of try out these new tactics.  And Sarah Palin's tactic is to be an attack dog and attack.  But she does it with a smile that looks so stupid.  It's irritating.  Yeah.  It's not.  It's like everyone has seen that stupid, smug smile.  Yeah.  Aggravating.  It's not enchanting.  And it's not charming. 
[00:57:00]  And it's not disarming.  It's just irritating.  She's got to have this look, which isn't this stupid corner of her mouth, little smile.  And she's talking about Obama palin' around with terrorists.  Huh?  Stop smiling.  Golly gee, gosh darn it.  Yeah.  Well, gosh darn it, we can't have a president doing that.  I was trying to think over the weekend, where does that play?  That whole, like, gosh darn it thing.  It doesn't play in New York.  Midwest someplace.  Midwest.  Is it just Midwest?  I don't even think it plays in the South, right? 
[00:57:30]  It doesn't play out West.  So where's that playing?  You think, like, the heart of America, like the Midwest?  South, too, I mean.  You think the South is into the whole golly gee thing?  Oh, my God, yeah.  It plays over, when you're on a plane, any place you're allowed to unbuckle your seatbelt  when you're flying cross-country, that's where it plays.  Yeah, I like that.  That's a good way to look at it.  I said a funny line years ago about, like, there's only, like, New York and L.A., everyone  else is farmers.  Farmers. 
[00:58:00]  A bunch of farmers.  Farmers.  That's kind of not true.  You look down when you're flying to L.A.  Just look down.  Or if you're in L.A., you fly to New York.  Just look down and tell me what you see.  Sometimes you'll see some sprawling lights.  Very rarely, though.  Usually, you'll see these round circles or little things that look like Pac-Man.  Those are farms.  And they cover the entire country.  They sure do.  And people that run those are called farmers. 
[00:58:30]  And there's a lot of them.  And they think like that.  And they like the way Sarah Palin talks.  They like what she has to say.  Mm-hmm.  And they don't like...  Wherever you can take your seatbelt off.  That's hilarious.  That's it.  Yeah.  And the pilot tells you.  This is what we got in Sarah Palin today.  I was reading today a copy of the New York Times.  All I hear is Cina Faye now.  It's really hard to...  This is the actual...  We have to tell people this is actually Sarah Palin.  Oh, she's being specific now with the New York Times, probably. 
[00:59:00]  Well, she was reading.  That's good.  I was reading today a copy of the New York Times.  Why are they booing the Times?  Because she delivered it like Yoda.  I was reading today a copy of...  I was reading today a copy of the New York Times.  Now, this, of course, yeah.  She's trying to make up for the fact that she couldn't name one goddamn newspaper that  she reads when Katie Couric asked her. 
[00:59:30]  And I was really interested to read in there about Barack Obama's friends from Chicago.  Turns out, one of his earliest supporters is a man who, according to the New York Times,  was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that, quote, launched a campaign of bombings  that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol. 
[01:00:00]  Boo.  Boo.  This is booing.  William Ayers, I think she's talking.  Yeah, yeah.  Boo.  I care.  I could care less.  I think it's an indication on Obama and his lack of judgment as to people's character.  Maybe, but they all hang out with scumbags.  Look at who Bush holds hands with.  He holds hands with the leaders of the country who sent 15 of the 19 terrorists. 
[01:00:30]  We were friends with Saddam, and then we weren't friends.  These guys all have disgusting associations.  But there were all reasons.  I don't honestly believe George Bush, the tool he is, wanted to walk through the Rose Garden  holding hands with a guy in a sheet.  It just looked silly.  It looked a little queer.  Yeah.  But, you know, this guy, he'd probably give him a reach around for the oil we get from 
[01:01:00]  that goddamn, godforsaken, primitive country over there.  And that's his motivation.  Other motivation is, yeah, political things.  I mean, the fact that we were supporting Iraq for so long is because they were enemies with Iran,  and we hated Iran.  So, that kind of put us in a tough spot.  But this Obama thing, there's a part of him, perhaps it was in his younger, rebellious days, 
[01:01:30]  but it shows this character, this part of him that, I don't know, is still kind of there underneath, maybe?  A little bit of a radical under there.  He's got some radical friends.  Friends, you know, how close does he pay attention to them still?  Is it, you know, it just opens up a few questions as to his judgment, even early on.  I don't know if it means anything now, but I'm not voting for him.  We all know that.  Here's more Palin. 
[01:02:00]  We see an America of exceptionalism.  Yes, USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  USA.  It's the car.  It's the car.  The tan Sierra.  The tan Sierra, that's my car.  Right.  Well, gosh darn it, USA.  Yeah.  USA.  USA.  So, you're running to be vice president with the funny-looking one.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Our opponent is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country.  Boo again.  What is this, a wrestling match?  What's going on?  Hiss, hiss, boo, hiss.  It's like Snidely Whiplash is going to come out and tire to the train tracks.  And someone's got, McCain's got to rescue her.  I'll rescue you.  Yay!  Oh, here comes Obama. 
[01:03:00]  Nuh-uh-uh.  Boo.  Hiss.  Boo.  Nuh-uh-uh.  This is stupid.  Dumb.  Oh, this election is lame.  The whole thing is lame.  Let's go to Jason in Mississippi.  He wants to defend the South, I think.  Jason.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's going on?  What's up, man?  Jason.  You were talking earlier about, oh, my gosh.  No, that will get you killed here.  I am?  Killed, yes. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I got to think he's right, man.  I don't think the South's going for that golly gee stuff either.  Maybe parts.  Maybe parts.  Because the South's going to do it again.  What?  Mm-hmm.  I love how they think the South is going to do it again or something.  What again?  South will rise up again.  Adam in Long Island.  Adam, what's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  What do you want to call it?  What Jimmy was saying about how everybody has, like, connections to scumbags.  Sarah Palin's husband is connected to a group of Alaskans who want to secede from the Union. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Big block of ice anyway.  We want it gone anyway.  Just give us the oil and beat it.  Yeah.  Scram.  Take your dumb wildlife with you.  It's a burden.  It does nothing but fly into our turbine engines and wreck things.  Our fine turbine engines are being destroyed by your delicate birds.  Exactly.  By your cockatoos.  Birds do nothing but cause problems in the environment.  They're a burden.  That's why burden is called burden. 
[01:04:30]  Absolutely.  It's their birds.  It was originally spelled B-I-R-D-E-N.  Of course it was.  And they figured it was too obvious.  All citizens should carry bats and go chirp, chirp.  When a bird comes down, you de-wing it.  Stupid things just frapping from the sky.  They're horrible.  Just awful.  Nervous system.  Things.  Get it all out at once.  Quickly.  Go.  Yeah.  All I have to do is go boo and everything inside him comes out.  Yeah.  Fluff-a-nutter comes out of it.  Thanks. 
[01:05:00]  That makes me happier than a good fire.  When I see a tree on fire and I see birds leaving it, I'm like, good.  They go to your house.  Way to think smart in a place where lightning might hit to build a house out of sticks and  leaves.  Good thinking, idiots.  They're nesting.  Yeah, they're nesting.  We started with Kimbo Slice.  We end this break with Kimbo Slice.  Dana White from the UFC.  This is what he had to say about the Kimbo Slice fight.  Here's my beef with Kimbo Slice.  I'll give it to you, too, that he's training and taking it serious, but this guy was fighting 
[01:05:30]  in backyards a few months ago.  The reality is if Kimbo...  Knocking down people's mailboxes, fighting in backyards.  That's a man act.  I had to.  I'm sorry.  So, Kimbo, you sound a little taller on radio.  Hey, boy.  Where's Kimbo Slice?  This was Dana White on our show talking about Kimbo Slice before this fight, so this is  quite interesting.  The reality is if Kimbo Slice, if I put him on the ultimate reality show, he wouldn't 
[01:06:00]  win it, okay?  Kimbo Slice sucks.  The guy who he fought on the last show was one step away from being a corpse, okay?  And he barely got out of that fight alive.  So you think they're putting up against softer opponents?  The fact that CBS is headlining their events with frigging Kimbo Slice, it's crazy.  I mean, anybody who knows the story about this business and where we were, even when  we were $44 million in the hole, man, we never went with the freak show angle. 
[01:06:30]  Right.  And Kimbo Slice is that freak show.  There you go.  That's what Dana White said three and a half months ago.  This Dana White knows the ultimate fighting game.  Yeah, he's pretty perceptive.  No kidding.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We're going to continue with another landlord doing some naughty things.  Naughty, naughty.  When this story came in today, I was thinking to myself, we did this last week.  But no, it's another creep.  All right.  And I think we might be celebrating Jocktober again today. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, I love Jocktober.  We'll have to check in with Sam and see if he's got a good one today for everybody.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Jimmy's going to be leaving in about an hour.  What?  To fly out to L.A. to promote Down and Dirty his new HBO show, Friday night to midnight.  And Patrice is stepping in to help us out. 
[01:07:30]  So there's like a little seg thing happening here.  Jimmy, we'll do another hour, and then Patrice will continue for the rest of the day.  Good morning, man.  And I see that you stole Jim Morrison's hat or something.  This is the latest look from Patrice.  Yeah, 60s black man.  I'm dressing like a 60s FBI agent, the first black FBI agent.  First thing that Patrice said, you're having daydreams.  Oh, daydreams.  Killing white people with daydreams.  Just sitting around like for...  I think about, and they're good ones because there's, you know, being a great football player 
[01:08:00]  and basketball player daydreams, that go about four hours.  Yeah.  This one's going about two hours.  Two hours.  Different ways, yeah.  A lot of detail in it.  Yeah, just a lot of like, how am I going to do it?  It's just I'm getting so fed up.  Yeah.  It's just I'm fed up with, you know what it is?  I'm just realizing white people just don't care.  Like, and not at least from you guys, at least you are fun white guys, whoever, you know, 
[01:08:30]  you're honest.  Yeah.  Like, you know, you have honest conversations, talk a little crap, you know?  But, you know, the Fox white guys, and you just watch it, and it's just, you know,  I'd go on John Gibson from time to time, his radio show.  He's not on TV no more, so he's just doing the radio.  Yeah.  And I like him.  He has a fun thing about him, but, you know, I watch the other guys, and even Hannity's  starting to become just not fun to look, like, I used to like Sean, like, he used to walk  through the hallway clicking his heels and stuff, but now it's just like, he's just, everything, 
[01:09:00]  it's just, you can just feel it, you go, this is, you can feel it.  Don't you think it's because of the election coming up, and the first black man, and white  he has to.  White people just won't say black, you do, which is fun.  Sure.  Oh, because?  You hear what else he says.  Yeah, right.  That's the radio version.  Exactly, but at least to have a conversation about it, you got to admit it. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  But the thing is, you know, you hear about this thing about Ohio, right?  What happened in Ohio?  Ohio.  That, um, possibly, uh, that people are taking, I don't know all the details, but they're  taking, like, bums and people, and they're going to, you know, register them and having  them register under homeless, like, shelters, and white people are welling up to say, oh,  bomb is going to steal Ohio, and I'm sitting there going, you know, white people don't even  know the word hypocritical.  Like, it just don't exist in their language. 
[01:10:00]  It's like, Bush stole the presidency.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  No, I don't want to hear that.  We're dealing with this Negro stealing the presidency.  We don't want to talk about old school stuff.  We want to talk about this right here.  There was plausible deniability with the Bush thing.  They threw in so many things.  Did you hear what you just said to me?  Yes.  This is what, this is why I don't like white people anymore.  It's starting to really bug me.  Not even on a fun not liking them.  I knew plausible deniability would get them. 
[01:10:30]  That would be it.  Piece of garbage.  I knew that would get you.  Is that the plural of garbage?  Piece of garbage.  It just makes me sick, because there is no, you can't even reason with your people.  Obama's camp is doing exactly what all the others have done in the past.  Thank you.  What the F?  And Ohio is a very important state, so they're getting the homeless zombies to vote.  Yeah.  They're getting the homeless zombies.  And it's not a crime.  They also want to get something passed where felons are allowed to vote. 
[01:11:00]  Good.  Why can't felons vote?  Because what, now why would it be, why would Barack Obama want felons to vote?  Why wouldn't you want felons to vote?  Doesn't that sound like something that's like, well, if I got up and said, you know, a lot  of felons are black, people would be like, well, a lot of felons are, but let me ask you  this, if, if I'm a felon and I get out, I still have to follow the rules of this country.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not like told to leave the country or told, listen, once 
[01:11:30]  you are a felon, you could just be a felon.  You could just keep committing crimes.  You don't have to follow the rules.  You don't have to pay taxes.  You don't have to try to get a job.  You are now, you are, but not, not most of them.  You, you don't have to cut through the system no more.  We, you don't do nothing.  Yeah.  If that's the case, then don't vote.  But if you still have to follow the rules of society when you get out and when you're  in there, really, you should be able to vote. 
[01:12:00]  Why can't a felon vote?  And there's a lot of innocent dudes in jail.  Once you're out, you should be able to vote.  When you're in jail, no, but once you're out, you should be able to vote.  Yes.  Yeah.  I think that's kind of crazy.  And why not while you're in?  I can't decide.  I, I, he's still my president.  You, you would understand why that would drive Anthony crazy.  He's still my president.  This is a privilege you lose in jail.  You should lose her.  Why?  To vote?  Because you're a criminal.  Yeah.  But what does that mean though?  Okay.  Why should I lose my privilege to vote because I'm in jail?  I broke the laws of society. 
[01:12:30]  There's laws of society, but this guy's still my president.  I'm not allowed to say that.  But part of the punishment is that you get no say in what goes on.  That's part of the, that's what the removal of the vote would be.  You've broken the laws of society.  And part of it is we don't want your input until you're done with your sentence.  But my vote is really not my, my vote is really not my input.  You, you, you, you're choosing a, a, a, a leader, I guess, or whatever.  So I don't understand where choosing to vote, you know, for your leader. 
[01:13:00]  You've proven through your actions, you've proven that you do not have good judgment  and you should not be allowed to vote.  Not saying that people that do vote have good judgment because a lot of them don't.  And you're talking about white collar dudes too, you're talking about, you're talking  about like Wall Street criminals and all those guys.  Well, okay.  Three Republicans and six million Democrats will get to vote.  Anthony's angle.  This is the problem.  A lot of Democrats in jail, Negro Democrats.  His angle on this.  A lot of white people in jail. 
[01:13:30]  Disproportionate number of black people.  This would help Obama.  Of course.  Yes.  That's why he's a little worried about this.  But there's a lot of white people in jail.  Yeah, I know, but it's just disproportionate.  Hey, we got to go to Amy in Connecticut.  Amy, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  How are you?  Wow, I finally got on.  I call you guys all the time.  No one cares.  Right, Amy?  No one cares.  I know, I know, I know.  What's up, Amy?  What do you got?  First, I just wanted to say to Patrice, it's so funny how black people can say they hate 
[01:14:00]  white people, but if white people said they hate black people.  It's funny how the way you said black sounds so love and stupid.  See, this is what kills me about white people.  Sounds like she's from Greenwich.  Yeah, white people really trying to hide.  This is what is really getting me to daydreams.  There really is no argument.  For me to say that I know that she's a little racial.  I can't say racist necessarily, but she's a little racial.  You can feel it.  I know it.  But white people are so good at lying now that it's no proof. 
[01:14:30]  I have to actually say she's lying to have a conversation with her about race.  Because she can call, I'm admitting my thing, but she's calling, acting like, I didn't see  color until you talk, Patrice.  Shut up, ass.  I want to compare your killing white people fantasies to my killing black people fantasies.  Well, here's mine.  How do yours play out?  Mine play out like this.  Because here's what I always realized, something that black people never had.  That every group had, a respectable criminal element. 
[01:15:00]  Like the mob.  Like somebody that actually touches your soul with your fear.  Meaning this, if Sean Bell gets killed, black people don't walk up the street with signs.  We just send a couple of guys to blow your house up.  And we don't know that it's black people.  Because that's the thing about us.  Because we, like, white criminals can kind of just melt into society.  Black criminals, it's like, we'll all get picked up.  It's just like, you know, I grew up in Boston, so Charles Stewart, he shot his wife in the 
[01:15:30]  head, and he said, nigga did it!  Or, nigga, you know, Edward did it!  Edward did it!  And every black person got messed around.  Right.  In the streets.  Well, black criminals make themselves too obvious.  It's like, how about you don't wear the green felt hat?  How about you kind of mellow out a little bit?  This is what I'm saying, is that I'm, I'm, I've, my daydream is very covert.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, a judge, I, first of all, I daydream that I'm, I'm in, I'm in court.  Uh-huh.  Actually, after the OJ trial. 
[01:16:00]  Okay.  And so I'm sitting there just going, all right, 12 counts of first degree kidnapping.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And you just look at this white lady judge who you know has some old Nicole problems.  And the white lady foreman who, uh, you know, of course, you know, we was instructed not  to remember that this guy got away with killing a white woman.  And so, because I'm an upstanding white person, I'm going to forget that whole thing.  So, so I'm just sitting there and I just want to go wink at the judge and just, you know, 
[01:16:30]  again, I don't know if this is a crime for me even saying I'm daydreaming about it, but  I'm just saying, you know, you just go, hey, this is wrong.  You know, it's wrong.  So, I'm going to, I'll be out of here in about, about an hour.  Mm-hmm.  I'll be, I'll be out.  Will you?  Really?  Yep.  Boom.  Blow that house up.  Boom.  Blow that house up.  This guy finds, you know, floating in the thing.  And then all of a sudden I get a pardon just because I have some things done.  Oh, okay.  That kind of, that kind of fear that touches you. 
[01:17:00]  Black people have never had that fear.  This is what I argued about before.  We never had that fear that if you wrong us, see the cops don't roll around where the mob  used to be, wherever the mobsters lived and just harass the mobsters.  No.  There's a lot of white cops that just roll through Harlem.  But the mobsters didn't randomly bash people on the head and take their jewelry.  Wait a minute.  That's the thing.  That's the thing.  It's like, you know, a couple of, you know, you know, they got, they got nicknames in the  hood, you know, oh, everybody's scatty.  Here comes Scooby, Scooby and Scrappy, you know. 
[01:17:30]  Because growing up, the white cops used to have nicknames in the hood.  Like, you know, oh, watch out.  Here comes Barney and Fred.  They're going to harass you.  They're going to put you in a trunk, beat you in the face, and then let you go.  It just, it just seems like we just don't have any respect at all.  It's just, that's what gets, when we talk about this, it's like, what are you afraid  of?  No one's afraid of us.  So my daydreams just consist of things to make white people really afraid. 
[01:18:00]  If anybody should be blowing up things, it should be black people.  But we don't.  See, here's the fear.  We don't.  If you were organized like that, like you say, some kind of a black Illuminati, I would  love that.  That'd be cool, because then you would know that you're not going to be in trouble.  You know you could walk the streets, and unless you wronged somebody, then you're fine.  And you know what?  It's the randomness.  Can I get in there real quick and say I 100% agree, because then it's like there's 
[01:18:30]  a hierarchy, there's rules, there's a protection factor, the neighborhood feels protected, no  randomness, no, you know, I'm just going to go beat up some random white person.  Exactly.  And it's not because I care about the random white person getting beat up, it's I care  about the police interfering with the neighborhood situation, a little protection racket, a little,  you know, if there's a white business on the outskirts of town, you know, a white business,  like a white tire shop, we go on and rouse them a little bit. 
[01:19:00]  Rouse them a little bit.  You know, whatever, if four tires cost 100 apiece, you know, you get, we get 100 for one tire,  you get three.  Yeah, okay.  You're working out.  You're working out an organization.  Some winking, some this and that, and my daydreams involve not randomly beating white  people in the head, but just having them have a real fear, not that ooga booga coming  out of a bush fear, but a real respect that you're not going to do that.  You know something, and for most people, if you didn't mess or get involved with the mob, 
[01:19:30]  no one from the mob is going to be knocking off your family or you or anything, because  you have nothing to do with the mob.  They had a code.  They have a code, they have this, that, whatever it was.  But like with black on white crimes, it's usually random robberies, assaults, things like that.  That's the fear that whitey has.  And mob, the mob, every Italian, almost every Italian, not so much now because the mob's  kind of becoming this, but you almost felt, and it's just like right now, you know who 
[01:20:00]  has that fear right now?  Russians.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You bump into a Russian, you go, his uncle might, and they're just known to clip your  toes off with a, you know, with a staple of gun, you know, they're just, they're brutal.  So you, it trickles down, and the fear, it's a respect.  Like these guys will come in and just tie you up and do things to you.  But when a black person, when you think about a black person coming in and tie you up, it's 
[01:20:30]  just like, oh, Lord, he's a home invader.  It's no business-like kind of.  Now you're touching on my daydreams.  Well, and yours involves probably a couple of trees or something, but it's always just  what you're going to do.  It's not what you're going to do to gain some respect.  My thing is, I just want to make sure judges just don't throw you in arbitrarily.  It's a respect thing.  Your, your daydreams are pussy compared to mine.  You got wimpy ass daydreams because you're blowing up a judge's house. 
[01:21:00]  This old, this old, let me finish.  That earns respect.  This old codger is taking his stupid robe off, ready to go into his orthopedic shower unit,  and his house blows up.  And he'll never do anything criminal again.  Mine are one-on-one.  Mine involve people with guns.  This is not a daydream.  This is reminiscing.  This is reminiscing.  It's an even match.  It's people coming into my house armed.  I'm armed.  And it's a fair fight.  This is reminiscing.  This is, this is, this is Charles Manson's daydream. 
[01:21:30]  This is what?  Listen to me.  This is health or skeleton.  It's me looking out in the street and seeing what happened.  Oh my God, there's machine gun fire.  There seems to be a war started.  The race war.  That to me is a good one.  But what are you in the race war?  I'm like quiet dude in the chair with the two guns that's crossed around his chest.  I am packed with all kinds of weaponry.  You're just a dude in the middle of the race war.  I'm just trying to hold off and keep my own.  He wants to rock and roll. 
[01:22:00]  Can I just jump in for a second?  I'm keeping my own.  I feel like I'm watching a buddy film.  Like you guys need to make a buddy film.  You guys would be great in a buddy film.  Because if you were the same color, you'd be best friends.  You know that.  We say that all the time.  You think the same way.  You guys got to make a buddy film.  And this is, this is the banter you can have in the car as you, as you fight the, fight  the real enemy.  Oh, race war.  Yeah.  You're just one of the dudes in the race war?  I'm just one of the guys.  I'm trying to think high level daydreaming. 
[01:22:30]  And you're just one of the guys.  No, no, no, no.  Do you have superpowers?  Anything?  Is your gun unlimited?  No, what are you doing?  I'm really good with a gun.  There was one of these daydreams that I had where I was kind of on a boat.  I'm on a boat doing a little patrolling action on the North Shore of Long Island.  You sure you aren't coming from Africa?  So you're doing a little patrolling action on the North Shore of Long Island. 
[01:23:00]  Because the further west you go, the worse it gets as far as enemy territory.  The further east you go, it's kind of wearing control still a little bit.  So is it like one of those small boats like from Apocalypse Now?  No, it's kind of a tricked out like pleasure craft that I, you know, A-teamed up.  Like a long Miami speedboat.  Like I A-teamed with some metal and, you know, some technology and some guns and stuff.  You're a wimp.  And then why?  Because you know they can't swim.  Well, that's why I'm in the water. 
[01:23:30]  So as I'm cruising patrol.  This is the most racist conversation ever.  This is a horrid conversation.  This is so horrible.  This is horrible.  I'm on a boat.  I'm the captain of the Amistad.  This is just horrible.  We look forward to when Patrice can come in because now we have excuses.  Look, we were doing it because the black guy was in.  Why can't you just talk?  You can't have a murdering black people in a U-boat daydream without Patrice here. 
[01:24:00]  Why couldn't this just be a pitch for a movie?  This could just be a pitch for a movie.  I'm nervous, and I'll tell you what.  You don't even want to hear the part where I go into action?  Yes.  Okay.  This is what I'm missing because you can't just daydream.  Straight stuff.  In my daydream, I leave something.  Oh, it's details.  All right.  Go ahead.  This could take a long time.  It's details, you know?  I thought you were just going to say, I'm daydreaming.  No, no, no.  I'm with the race war, and I'm just in it.  Now I'm patrolling.  Okay.  You're patrolling.  Now I'm patrolling.  And what do I see through my binoculars? 
[01:24:30]  I see a young, vulnerable white girl whose parents have been slaughtered, and she's on  the beach.  Just crying.  Just trying to make her way through.  Wait a minute.  What is she doing?  Kicking shells?  No, no.  She's hungry, maybe.  She's just very vulnerable.  She's somewhere on the beach.  She's on the beach.  Her parents have been killed in the race war.  How old is she?  She's probably 17. 
[01:25:00]  She's legal?  She's legal age?  Yeah.  He loves this fantasy because the parents can't interfere with her coming to his house.  Give it to her right on the back of the U-boat.  So all of a sudden, I hear something, and a couple of the brothers come out, and now  they see the girl, chase her down, and now they are just ready to ravage her.  I mean, just ready.  I pull out one of my rifles with the scope on it.  You don't get off the boat.  I'm on the boat at this point. 
[01:25:30]  And you don't do a slow motion pump shotgun pump without even holding it, just throw it  down, and it comes back up?  This is a frigging Barrett .50 Cal sniper rifle mounted on there.  And I just, right when they're ready to take this poor girl and just ravage her, just his  head explodes in a pink mist in my scope.  Wait a minute.  So you snipe him, right?  I snipe him.  And then I come up, and the girl comes on the boat.  Of course you do.  And, well, I have to raise her.  Oh, you know what? 
[01:26:00]  Of course you do.  Is this a very noble daydream?  Yeah.  If you, if you, if you, if you just left, why would I leave?  I can't leave her there.  There's still more people.  You know what?  Wait a minute, Norton.  His dream has ended up being this.  He kills the attempted idea of a rape to rape.  This is ultimately a he gets the rape dream.  Hey, at least I'm white.  How nice of you to raise the age for the radio show, by the way. 
[01:26:30]  How nice you added three years.  This is so awful.  This is terrible.  I know these pieces of garbage out there have so many days in Asia to make me sick.  Oh, my God.  We have to take a quick break.  Patrice O'Neal in studio giving us a lot of energy.  October 16th through the 18th to catch a rising star in Lincoln, Rhode Island.  That's a very white area.  What are you doing?  What area isn't? 
[01:27:00]  But this week I'm in Addison, the Addison Improv in Texas.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  You been there?  Nice, nice.  A few times, yeah.  I'll be there this weekend.  Oh, very cool.  Thursday through Sunday.  We got a nice audience down in the Dallas area.  Sure.  Go see Patrice and Addison this weekend.  I will say ONA fans are very, damn it, loyal coming out people, boy.  I'll tell you that, man.  I got a message from Voss.  They came out in droves in Cleveland.  So everybody, we're on in Cleveland right now.  Voss thanks you.  I will say that, man.  For checking him out up there. 
[01:27:30]  Opie and Anthony, we'll continue.  Patrice O'Neal helping us out today.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I got to ask Patrice about Sarah Palin.  What's your thoughts on this fraud?  That was another thing.  That, I forgot about that.  That made, it was OJ, Ohio thievery, and listening to people try to make Sarah Palin, that she won that, that it was interesting. 
[01:28:00]  All I could do is say to people who are voting for McCain and try to defend Sarah Palin, if something happened and they go, McCain wins, and they go, oh my God, the president has died.  Heart attack, whatever.  And then she gets up and goes, I'm your president.  I'm your president.  Oh, it's a terrible tragedy.  Oh, gosh.  I seem to be the president.  Can you imagine?  Can you imagine?  Somebody, one of my friends said this, man. 
[01:28:30]  If, and this is another thing, which I mean, white people don't care.  If Obama's ticket was this, was McCain and Palin with five kids, one of her kids is pregnant out of wedlock, teenage pregnant, you know, retarded kids.  Uh, uh, witchcraft, like some African voodoo priest is in her camp.  Um, all these things that is going, can you imagine if this was the ticket, Obama's ticket? 
[01:29:00]  And white people don't care.  She has a voodoo guy.  No, they kind of care.  I mean, the polls are showing that Obama's lead is, you know.  Do you believe in polls?  What did, what did, what did, ask Obama's boobs?  Yeah, that's not all black people voted for him.  White people like Obama, too.  A lot of the country likes him.  The numbers, Jim, the numbers.  Okay, I don't know how many black people are supposed to vote and should vote.  I don't know how many Mexicans are supposed to vote, but I don't know.  But I know there's 250 million white people in this country. 
[01:29:30]  Something like that.  300?  250 million?  No.  There's 250 million white people in this country.  300 million.  300 million.  Total.  And it's 200 million white people.  Tim.  200 million white people.  Two-thirds.  Tops.  Okay.  After you clear out all the black people that are supposed to vote for him, which not all  black people are, because we are just brainwashed by righteousness.  98% are.  No.  They, again, they asked 100 black people.  I'm telling you, I'm black. 
[01:30:00]  I know all black people ain't voting.  Black people are afraid to have a black leader just like white people are.  There's a lot of black people who are horrified the idea of a black guy running stuff.  You see how we treat each other when we run?  If we have a white boss, it runs well.  You ever see a black run McDonald's?  You ever see when there's black people and there's just this one little creepy white boy  that's running the place?  How it runs.  But it's just all black people in the McDonald's? 
[01:30:30]  You see how it runs.  There's a lack of respect we have for each other.  We love white people.  What is that?  Because I'm going to tell you, our whole definition of our existence in this country  is based on how we feel about white people.  It's based on whether we hate you or whether we love you.  So start loving us.  Start loving us more.  Why don't you start loving the black people?  I love the treats.  Stop shoving things inside of me.  Stop tasering me.  Stop beating me in the face.  Stop misbehaving.  Stop being loud in movie theaters. 
[01:31:00]  Pull over.  Do I deserve a tasing?  Pull over and give your license and registration.  Stop demanding more dumplings, bitch, from the Chinese ladies serving the food.  More dumplings.  More dumplings.  Oh, yeah.  And she won't give you none.  No.  This is extra dumpling.  Are you kidding me?  It's 50 cents?  You charge me 50 cents for a pack of duck sauce.  You cheap bitch.  So?  I feel sorry for your mother.  Did you do the bit on the show about how, like, you go to the same restaurant forever? 
[01:31:30]  And they treat you the same exact...  I must have spent $1,000 every six months in the Chinese dry cleaner.  Treats me like the same piece of garbage at the day I came in.  Won't give me a free shirt.  Won't even give me something that you stamp that says you're a frequent buyer so I could get...  Maybe dry clean my socks for free.  Some of these...  Something.  Some of these businesses just don't understand.  They don't get it.  You gotta give a little if you got a customer coming back over and over again. 
[01:32:00]  A little loyalty.  A little loyalty.  A little loyalty.  But some of these people just don't get it.  And this goofy...  This goofy...  Sarah Palin...  It just...  How can you...  Look, man.  How can you...  And I understand how white people are just nervous.  Man.  But God damn it.  Black people are awful decent for a group of people that just get played.  Patrice, they just gave us some weird choices this time around.  It's just bizarre.  And so the thing is that out of all these weird choices, Obama's the least weird. 
[01:32:30]  He's like the one you vote for just to see.  And again, oh, back to the 200 million.  I'm sorry.  The numbers.  How many?  And you travel a lot, Jimmy.  I only...  I feel that there's only three cities in this whole country.  I mean, there's LA.  And I mean, for real.  Yeah.  And New York is such a different vibe.  I went to Stanford, Connecticut this weekend.  It's 40 minutes outside the city.  It was almost like I took a plane ride to another country. 
[01:33:00]  The white people were so different from who the metropolitan white people, which is only  Chicago has metropolitan white people, LA, and New York.  The rest we have to depend on going into a voting booth when the curtain goes behind them  and that thing goes shh and pushing a button that says the black president, dude.  I don't...  I don't even count LA.  I don't know if that's going to happen. 
[01:33:30]  You should even count LA.  Hey, don't forget San Francisco, I count more than LA.  San Francisco, absolutely.  I put...  I mean, I'm going to miss a few.  Yeah.  I don't think Seattle's metropolitan, by the way.  Too many white people.  They don't have a...  There's no mix.  They have a downtown.  But I'm talking about every corner of everywhere.  Boston.  Boston, no way.  No way.  Boston is a separate town.  Sully in the game when that curtain is pulled back.  When that curtain is pulled back, we have to depend on enough white people to push  that button.  To push that button.  And I don't know if it's going to happen. 
[01:34:00]  That's all.  But if he's elected, it's going to come down to whitey voting for him.  Yes.  You know that.  Yes.  And speaking of which, Stump Brain was telling me about a Simpsons episode that's happening.  They got a good take on this whole thing.  Yeah, the Treehouse of Horrors is coming out for Halloween.  It's just before the election.  They leaked about five minutes of it.  Homer goes in to try and vote for Obama.  And every time he keeps pushing the button, it switches to McCain.  And he pushes it about five times.  And then the machine finally kills him.  I'll post it.  That's great.  That's funny. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, we'll get that on onaradio.com.  So that's my thing, fellas, on that.  I just don't know how many white people we can count on for real.  For real.  When the curtain's closed.  All right.  And that's it.  Haylin's don't watch.  Haylin's don't know.  Haylin's stinks.  It's horrific.  Before we miss the moment, we got the Simpson thing I just talked about.  The audio.  I don't know if it'll play.  Maybe it's a better visual.  But we'll find out.  Hello, I'd like to vote for President, Governor, and anything that will take money away from our parks and libraries.  Hey, use machine number three. 
[01:35:00]  Ooh, one of those electronic voting dealies.  One vote for McCain.  Thank you.  No, I want to vote for Obama.  Two votes for McCain.  Come on, it's time for a change.  Three votes for McCain.  No, no, no.  Six votes for President McCain.  Hey, I only meant one of those votes for McCain.  This machine is rigged.  Let's tell President McCain. 
[01:35:30]  This doesn't happen in America.  Maybe Ohio, but not in America.  All right on, man.  He killed it.  And then they put an I voted sticker on his head.  Too good.  Oh, man.  Haylin's whole gosh darn it.  Oh, Joe.  And if you notice, did you notice, at first, here's what she did.  And this is another thing.  The arrogant people talk about why he picked Palin, right? 
[01:36:00]  Uh-huh.  Again, I'm talking from, and I'm only talking from gut.  This is the problem.  I'm only talking from gut.  He picked it.  The way I see it, white people are arrogant to the highest level.  He picked her just for a certain section of the votes.  First of all, he doesn't believe he's going to die, ever, because his mama's still alive.  So he thinks he's going to live to be 127.  So to him, he's a teenager.  It doesn't matter.  That whole him dying in office from natural causes ain't happening.  It's just not going to happen. 
[01:36:30]  His mama's still alive.  It ain't happening.  He still has a mama at 72.  A heartbeat for the presidency.  Holy new mother.  So the thing is with her is that first she tried to be, and you can tell what happened  during this thing.  And I was angry at Wheezy from the Jeffersons who was moderating it and didn't get in her  ass.  She actually told her, I'm not going to answer your questions, black lady. 
[01:37:00]  She couldn't get on her too hard because she's got a book coming out.  Nobody got on her too hard except for your girl, Katie Couric.  And she went from trying to know the issues, and they got her in the room and probably beat  her with a stick and said, listen, here's what you do.  You go out there and you get these dumb mothers who are looking at you like black people looking  at Obama just as a chick.  Like, yes.  Yeah, I'm you.  Stop trying to be smart.  So that's why she went out there and went, oh, oh, I'm the whole guy who wants a soccer 
[01:37:30]  mom as their president, not even stock.  Here's the thing about the president.  He should be better than you.  Your president should be better than the citizens.  I don't want my buddy as my president.  Neither do I.  I don't want a palsy walsy.  And they talk about Obama comes off as good.  He's supposed to come off as better than you.  He's supposed to run the country.  That's what he's supposed to do.  You're not supposed to be.  I don't want a dude that's like, man, he makes me feel like I'm going to be in McDonald's 
[01:38:00]  and just kick it with him.  Oh, man.  Hey, old dog.  Stop.  Hey, yo, B.O.  What's happening, man?  I don't want that.  They're trying to find how Sarah Palin is good.  People are making all these excuses for her.  She sucks.  She sucks.  I get a lot of hate emails over that.  She sucks.  On a real level, be honest with yourself for a second.  It's awful.  At least, look at all these other hardcore political broads, Condoleezza and Pelosi, they 
[01:38:30]  would come in.  And even Hillary, she comes in as what she is.  She already has a political point of view.  She already exists.  She's not going to come in and try to figure it out.  This girl is figuring out what she's going to be right in front of our eyes.  And people are lying.  People, I mean, let me ask you a question.  Is it allowed for a Republican to go, ah, you know, she stinks, but I'm going to still 
[01:39:00]  vote for her because I'm a Republican?  Yeah.  Or if Obama said, hey, look, let's call off the debates so we can deal with this.  If Obama did that, would the Republicans go, oh, that scared Negro?  Like, can you just be honest for a second?  Just a second.  Because that's how they operate.  That's how politicians operate.  It has nothing to do with race or sex at that point.  It's like, what can we do with race and sex to advance us politically? 
[01:39:30]  This Palin situation, I really didn't want to follow how bad she is.  And my friend is, when I found out that she has an African witch doctor and nobody is  saying a word about it.  Well, we saw that it obviously didn't work.  You know, she probably did it five times and the fifth time it kind of backfired.  So let's just say that that was the wrong dance you did there. 
[01:40:00]  I'd like my money back.  What the hell?  What the hell?  It's raining and I got a kid with a P. Rose haircut.  What did you do wrong here?  You mixed up the witchcraft today.  Can you imagine if Obama had a Corky baby anywhere near his Corky?  Can you imagine if he had a baby like that anywhere?  A pregnant 12th cousin. 
[01:40:30]  Now, if he had a pregnant daughter out of wedlock, people would be going, I'll see how they are.  Here they go.  Yeah, I'll agree with you on that one.  30 pampers in the Oval Office.  But they turned it into like, look at the loving mom accepting the daughter and, of  course, the boyfriend.  They'll be married.  They're going to get married.  Thank you.  Can you at least, I'm going to shut up about it.  If somebody can admit, just admit, white people are phony.  Just admit it and I'll go with it. 
[01:41:00]  We're all phony.  I admit completely, white people are phony.  You're right.  Thank you.  He's completely right.  Thank you.  I'll definitely admit that.  We all are.  We all are.  We're a bunch of phonies.  We're talking about y'all right now.  What'd you say?  White people are phony.  You're right.  They won't talk about Obama being black.  Just be honest for five seconds, would you?  Everyone, so you know what it is, though?  I'll tell you something.  And I'll play the devil's, the white devil's advocate here.  Which is redundant.  Go ahead.  The phoniness. 
[01:41:30]  Just say I'm playing the advocate.  The phoniness comes from this fear we have to have to be politically correct because the repercussions cost you things like your job and stuff.  And this is directly because of black leaders like Al Sharpton.  Are you victimizing yourself for being phony?  Did you just victimize?  No, not me.  I don't give a crap.  You just blame Al Sharpton for white people's phoniness.  People like Al Sharpton.  And just, we've been put in this position where we can't be honest lest we lose our jobs. 
[01:42:00]  It all comes back to phony white people, though, Ant.  Because Sharpton talks to these other phony white people.  And they actually listen to him and Jesse Jackson instead of calling them out for things like Freddy's or for things like Jaime Town.  So to me, it all goes back to phony white people.  Yeah, I know.  But we just are putting this.  I would love to have open dialogue where people can just all be honest.  But it'd be beautiful.  It just doesn't work.  I think we'd have laughs about it.  Like black people and white people get in a room and just start really talking and being honest. 
[01:42:30]  I think both sides would just be laughing.  To just say 12 felony counts of kidnapping is I'm going to get you.  Just please just say that.  Just say after he has been found guilty of four counts of first degree.  You know first degree felony kidnapping is I'm going to, hey, come here, Opie.  Put you in a trunk, drive you somewhere, and then call your mama and say, give me $10 million for you. 
[01:43:00]  That is felony kidnapping.  First degree felony kidnapping is planning something in which you hold someone against it.  Why are you just Wikipedia it?  You know, I'm talking from my balls, and you are reading it to the letter answer.  Do you understand how white that is?  You Wikipedia it.  Do you understand that that's the white thing to do is to go, wait a second here.  The law.  What it says is it's not the letter.  Let's talk real. 
[01:43:30]  What felony kidnapping is is come here.  I'm holding you hostage.  Give me some money.  Not give me my stuff.  I'm in your presence.  Give me my stuff.  That's robbery.  That's some type of coercion.  When you're holding someone against the will.  Will you stop it?  Look, let us have our day.  You can have it.  Let us have our day.  You can have it.  You can have your day back in 95.  This is our day.  This is our day.  Let me tell you something.  Roddy Piper says something.  My favorite wrestler of all time. 
[01:44:00]  Wow, you're quoting Roddy Piper.  Roddy Piper.  Oh, we all better be quiet.  He said, just when, just when, after he beat up this guy on Piper's Pit, just when you  think you have all the answers, I change the questions.  And that's what white people do.  When O.J. got off, it was, hey, we need to change the judicial system.  It's like, as soon as a Negro, I had to say Negro, does something, white people go, we  got to change the rules, because we're not happy. 
[01:44:30]  You change them, the soonest things ain't right, we have to change the rules.  Don't change the rules.  What?  You want them to be changed?  Just like Obama, just like they're trying, just like they're trying, you stupid.  I want a lot of things.  Just like this Ohio thing, they're setting it up to have him have stole Ohio.  When Bush stole, everybody knows, he fixed Florida, but now it's the old thiever Negro.  Everyone knows the election comes down to what, three states? 
[01:45:00]  Is it Florida, Michigan, and Ohio for the most part?  Los Angeles, too, and New York, too, man.  Well, no, New York's already determined.  This is Obama, Obama state.  It's going to go Democrat, New York.  But it comes down to Ohio, Florida, and what?  Possibly Nevada.  Really?  Yep.  Okay.  But that's it.  That's what the election is.  They got to make sure they win Ohio.  Did they say something like a president hasn't won an election without winning Ohio?  Forever.  Well, a Republican president.  Hmm?  A Republican president. 
[01:45:30]  Is that what it was?  All right.  Yeah, not Democrat, because Democrats don't win Ohio necessarily.  Hey, can we change gears for a second?  Yes.  We got a great story here.  We have another creepy landlord putting in peep cameras.  Oh, man.  And I think this is out of Ohio, matter of fact.  Of course it is.  So there's your segment.  Norton, you own some real estate in Ohio?  That's my goal in life, is to buy a building and just rent it to girls really cheap.  Really?  $300 a month?  Relax.  It's a handle. 
[01:46:00]  Just have holes in the wall everywhere.  Oh, please.  Ignore that little camera by your toilet and point up at you.  Security.  Right out of the toilet.  A Cleveland landlord is accused of being a peeping Tom.  Dominic Butch Rodriguez faces charges he set up a camera in a bathroom used by his tenants,  a mother and her teenage daughters.  I was getting ready for work, and she came to me and said,  Mom, there's a camera in the shower.  And I'm like, what are you talking about?  After making the discovery, the mother took a picture of the bathroom camera with her cell phone. 
[01:46:30]  Another photo of the camera has been filed with court papers.  The woman rented an apartment belonging to Rodriguez.  She says he told her she and her daughters would have to use the basement bathroom because of plumbing problems.  I think it's crazy.  We don't know if we're somewhere on the internet, and I wouldn't know where to begin to look for something like that.  Cleveland sex crimes detectives say the camera was connected to an upstairs VCR.  Investigators seized computers, CDs, and videotapes from Rodriguez.  All right, I blame the mother and daughter, and I'll tell you why. 
[01:47:00]  Look at this creep.  Why would you live in one of his houses?  He looks like Santa Claus.  Oh, my God.  Look at this cross-eyed Santa Claus.  He looked from here.  I don't know if my eyes are good, but he looks like the, remember Blade, the first Blade?  The thing that he burned with the light?  The information?  Do you remember the first Blade?  No.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  But where did he put the camera?  In the soap?  He had them in a special bathroom in the basement.  First of all, that's a bad sign. 
[01:47:30]  But where's the hole at in the bathroom?  It's in the basement, so it's probably like a weird, he probably had it rigged a certain way in the corner on one of the tiles in the basement.  He just said they'd use a bathroom in the basement because of plumbing problems.  All right, Norton, where would you put the camera?  Probably I would put it in the ceiling fan, and I would have one in the corner.  I would have black tiles and multicolored tiles with different patterns on them.  Ah, distraction.  Distraction.  I would have a big camera pattern on all of them.  It would be camera patterns. 
[01:48:00]  With little eyeballs painted all over the tiles.  That's actually brilliant.  Are you enjoying your Canon wallpaper?  Would I be crazy to have a camera hidden among all these?  Yeah.  You might, pervert.  You might.  Right, this camera wallpaper.  A paper.  I would go with the Scarface clock myself.  Yeah.  With the 12 gone.  The big, huge number 12 gone out of the clock.  I'm trying to think of where a camera could be. 
[01:48:30]  That you would never, like in your own house, where have you never looked?  And go, wait a minute, is there a camera right there?  It all comes down to what you are trying to accomplish with this.  Yeah.  Because I would just, I'd be happy with the boobie shots myself.  I don't need, like, you know, an upstart camera or anything.  If you're doing that, you need the full dirtiness.  If you're just putting.  Where would you go?  I would go, I would have to go, like, chest level.  I'd go alarm keypad.  Where you'd never look.  Alarm keypad would be good.  I'm trying to think of my house and where I've never would, for me, I'd put the camera 
[01:49:00]  under the contents.  No, vents aren't good.  Someone's thinking in a vent.  Vents aren't good.  You see them.  You can see that crap in there.  Yeah, because I've taken dumps and I've just, like, sat there and just, you know, when you're  taking a dump, you just look.  Yeah.  Around.  Say, where can I put a camera?  Well, you can put it in the shower head, but you'd be suspicious because there's no water 
[01:49:30]  coming through one little hole.  There's no water coming out of it.  There's just no water coming out of it.  A red blinking light in your shower.  Plus, they have to come off sometimes.  You have to put it in something that's probably not going to be touched for years.  Permanent.  It's got to be, yeah, something that's not going to be touched.  I'll bet you it was a lighting fixture in the shower.  I'll bet you he had lighting fixtures in the shower.  Like, they're recessed in the...  Because chances are he's the one who's going to be changing those bulbs anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or it was in a pattern in the lighting thing.  Big old 80s camcorder swinging from a cord.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  That is strange.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Patrice O'Neill.  Chuck Berry had it in the toilet.  Yeah, that's...  Does nothing for me.  There's a Polaroid, too.  It was really inconvenient.  You have to keep sneaking in.  Patriceoneill.com.  That's what we promote right now.  Why not?  Yeah.  How are your show dates?  Sure.  Whatever.  Jimmy?  Boston.  I think November 15th, the Wilbur Theater.  I don't know if there's tickets available, but I think there might be for that third show,  which is not sold out yet.  Oh, that's the new Carly Connection, right? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Friday Late Show.  And local hockey fans, stay right where you are.  You've got a chance to win some Devil's tickets in moments.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The show's flying by this morning.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Patrice O'Neal.  Uh, I got this for Patrice.  We found it.  It's simple as this.  Just when they think they got the answers, I change the question.  I like that.  That's it. 
[01:51:00]  That's the great Roddy Piper, baby.  Oh, yeah.  You following the baseball, Patrice?  Uh, no.  But the Red Sox, I know one thing.  If I was a Red Sox fan, I'd like to beat the dog doo-doo out of Manny.  Like, he just decided I'm not going to work.  And then he went to Dodgers and became a Superman.  Yeah.  Like, I've never.  I'm not even into baseball.  I know, man.  This is how you know things is going when you don't care.  This is how I know Wayne Gretzky is famous and Tiger Woods is famous. 
[01:51:30]  Because I don't pay attention to hockey or golf.  And I know these guys exist.  I don't pay attention to baseball.  And I know what Manny's doing.  Manny is a monster right now.  By the way, Gretzky retired about 10 years ago.  But I'm saying, when he played, you know what I mean?  No, I know, I know.  Just the idea of, holy mo-  You never sat through a hockey game, but you know who Gretzky is.  Yeah, like, I don't care about baseball like that.  He's nailing this Manny thing.  The Dodgers are just, you know, they moved on.  They beat the Cubs.  By himself, he changed the scope of a team. 
[01:52:00]  That was Boston being dummies once again, letting another high-profile player go.  He was being a jerk.  They hated him in Boston.  They couldn't wait to get rid of him.  But he stopped playing.  What am I going to do if he stopped playing?  If you come in here and you just stop being funny, what good are you, even though you're good?  I'll bet you it was because, and again, I'm not saying he's right to do this, but it was  probably over ugly contract negotiations, and he knew that he was going to walk.  I'm guessing.  Which, I'm not saying it's right, but those dumbbells have let too many good players go. 
[01:52:30]  This is why I'm not that upset about the Patriots.  I think the Patriots do it.  I think they just let people go.  And they reaping what they sow a little bit.  They just let people go.  They just let you walk away.  But the Red Sox are doing well, though.  The Red Sox kind of don't need Manny right now.  Yeah, they're still in it.  And the Patriots won as well.  Did they win last night?  Who?  The Red Sox.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, they lost.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The Angels beat the Red Sox.  You're right.  They did, like, what, 12 innings? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's true.  And then the dumb Brewers are out of it.  They should be, right?  The Phillies beat the Brewers, but I haven't seen, like, the Brewers play in years.  And I remember the story.  Seth and Phil, this son, plays for them.  Yeah, yes.  And the game was on yesterday, and I forgot because I remember when the story came out.  Remember the mascot used to kind of, like, slide into a big mug of beer?  And the team's called the Brewers.  Right.  So it made perfect sense, but, you know, the politically correct people out there, you know, got that one, too. 
[01:53:30]  So now it kind of, like...  It resembled a car accident.  Yes.  It kind of jumps into, like, a pool of water.  It's not beer.  Comes out like Jim.  Why?  But they took that away from the fans up there, that miserable place that is Milwaukee.  Like, it had one thing, you know, the dumb mascot goes into his mug of beer.  That's ridiculous.  And they took that away.  Some teams aren't supposed to win. 
[01:54:00]  No one wants to see the Milwaukee Brewers.  No.  No.  They're just a team that should just be around because you need teams to play.  But to watch them go any further than...  Yeah, they're like the friggin', what is that, the...  Who plays the Harlem Globetrotters?  You know, the generals, yeah.  The generals, that's what they are.  They're like the generals.  Who needs...  No one...  They're just somebody to watch play.  You know, Patrice, you're so right.  Because I'm...  You know, obviously we want to be in touch with the NFL and stuff.  And I'm looking, like, what games matter? 
[01:54:30]  And it's filled with a bunch of teams that are just there for other teams to beat.  Tennessee Titans are undefeated.  Right.  Really?  Right.  The old Houston Oilers are undefeated?  No one cares.  How about that?  Right.  How about who cares?  What are some of those teams...  What are some of the teams that are just there for other people to beat them up?  The Expos.  Buffalo Bills.  They're Buffalo...  What are you insane?  Three and one.  They're there.  They're, again, Milwaukee Brewers were good enough to make it to be interesting.  Buffalo Bills are a team to just watch play. 
[01:55:00]  I strongly disagree with that one, but go ahead.  Who wants to see...  That's why the gods of football wouldn't let them win when they went to the Super Bowl  four years in a row.  No one cares.  No one wants to see the world champs, Buffalo Bills.  It was the Illuminati.  Nothing good could come out of the Bills winning the Super Bowl.  We want to see Chicago.  We want to see L.A.  We want to see Boston.  We want to see New York.  Dallas.  Does anyone want to see Miami?  Dallas is in there.  Dolphins?  Cowboys?  Yes. 
[01:55:30]  Nobody cares.  Nobody wants to see Miami.  Even though Miami's good, but no one wants to see Miami.  There's better teams to pick on, like the Bengals.  The Bengals?  Cincinnati?  They're there just to...  So there's a lot of games to be played.  Let me tell you, Ohio deserves not a champion, except for Ohio State.  No one wants to see Ohio win anything.  The Browns.  Why can't you give them a championship?  You know how cold and miserable it is?  What?  The homeless zombies?  Give them a championship.  Poor Cleveland does have nothing.  They have a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  That's a bunch of homeless people.  And that shouldn't be there. 
[01:56:00]  They should cancel the lease and move that to somewhere where I can go see it.  You don't want to see it.  Football Hall of Fame should leave there.  It should be in New York.  Every Hall of Fame should be in New York.  It should be someplace where people go.  Well, you don't like going to Springfield, Massachusetts?  That's what I'm saying.  I watched the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies, NBA.  Right.  I'm going...  There was...  Like, Pat Riley was on stage.  His entire team came to see him.  And all I kept thinking was, what hotel are they staying in?  Are they in a Springfield Hilton? 
[01:56:30]  Some kind of comfort inn.  Where is A.C. Greene sleeping tonight?  There's a bus waiting for them, and they go right back to New York.  Oh, kidding.  Where do they go to Boston?  They probably had to bring their own blankets and pillows to the comfort inn.  Is Magic Johnson at the Four Seasons in Springfield, Massachusetts?  They have a two-seasons, not a four-seasons.  They don't have a four-seasons.  That's all I can do is...  Ever been to Springfield?  Look at these suits. 
[01:57:00]  They don't even have one of those steamers in the closet.  Dude, I went once, and half the stuff was falling off the walls and stuff.  It was an asshole.  Supposedly, they pumped money into the thing and made it nice again.  This is the Hall of Fame?  Yeah, I went.  Like, the pictures were peeling out of the plaques and everything.  It was just...  It was bad news.  And I'm going to tell you, out of Hall of Fames, which is interesting to me, like, again,  I think it's an interesting concept.  Because, I mean, as a person, I don't respect the Hall of Fame, but I'm going to tell you  what Hall of Fame I do respect is baseball's Hall of Fame.  They don't let you in. 
[01:57:30]  Like, they don't play around.  Like, football kind of plays around and basketball plays around, but baseball, you can't get in.  Unless you're for real.  They just don't play around.  500 home runs.  You've got to have certain things will get you in regardless.  Wow!  500 home runs is one of them.  X amount of wins.  But they will keep a lot of people out.  But there's a reason.  I went to the Baseball Hall of Fame probably 20 years ago.  Back then, there wasn't room for all the guys.  You had to go down hall after hall after hall.  There's not a lot of guys in the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
[01:58:00]  They just don't have a lot of room anymore.  I mean, baseball's been around for, what, 110 years or something crazy?  Perhaps.  I mean, they won't let Pete Rose in.  And again, just to let you know that I'm not a full-on racial guy, Pete Rose is just an injustice.  It really is.  To not let that...  I'm saying like this.  Even if he was betting.  He's not being let in because he was betting.  Let's say he was betting.  He broke all these records and he was betting. 
[01:58:30]  Right.  So if he was playing it straight, he would have 10,000 hits?  Like, he has more hits than anybody and he was cheating.  Yeah.  But he was not cheating in terms of drugs.  He was cheating and betting and still was the best player there was.  You can't have a Hall of Fame if the guy that has the most hits ever is not in it.  It's just stupid.  Put him in.  His arrogance is what kept him out.  Had he come clean a lot sooner and just they would have eventually forgiven him. 
[01:59:00]  It's Stalinism.  He was such a prick.  It's like Stalin.  He did not exist.  Make it like he never existed.  Come on.  They should put him in the basement of the...  Something.  Yeah, at least in the basement.  All right.  Here he is.  Go downstairs.  He's had to.  He's near the boiler.  He has that haircut like Chagall from No Country for Old Men.  Yeah.  That's a good...  That's a new one.  Bill's 4-1.  I just want to make that correction.  I'm just saying no offense to Buffalo.  I'm just saying it's one of those teams.  Let's be honest.  Here's the thing. 
[01:59:30]  People kill me with their loyalty, the things that aren't loyal to them.  Like, you know, Cleveland's loyal to Cleveland, but they're not loyal to you.  Just shut your face for a minute and think about it on a high level.  I'm a Patriots fan.  I'm a Celtics fan.  But look, I've never been able to say this to Boston people.  We've been losers.  All of a sudden, we have this culture of winning.  Boston stunk my entire life in sports.  In 80s, for a stretch in the 80s, they were good in basketball. 
[02:00:00]  For a stretch in the 60s, 50s and 60s, I wasn't even born.  Bill Russell.  And Bill Russell hates Boston because they treat him like a damn dirty ape.  That's what Boston do, make you run out of there.  So he hates it.  But they were good then.  The Patriots stunk my entire life.  They stunk.  People forget.  The 85 Bears, they're still putting alcohol swabs on the beating that the Bears gave them. 
[02:00:30]  They lost to the Green Bay Packers.  Drew Bledsoe got hurt.  And Tom Brady, God bless him, comes in and we win.  But we're not a culture of winning.  And the Red Sox, please don't be frustrated.  There were people who had great-grandparents who were born and died of old age and did not see the Red Sox win anything.  And all of a sudden, Boston is walking around like, look, we're winners.  We're the culture.  Just be happy. 
[02:01:00]  You don't boo your people.  Just be happy.  We're winners now.  But remember, the Celtics, we didn't win for 22 years.  It wrecked everything, though.  It wrecked everything, because then people didn't know what to do with themselves with the winning team.  You were born and graduated college.  Right.  And had nothing.  And never seen.  You know what I mean?  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Hey, you guys couldn't be more right about, or Patriots couldn't be more right about Springfield.  That's where I live, and the city is such a joke. 
[02:01:30]  Like, right on the other side of where the Hall of Fame is, on the other side of the interstate, it's like crack central.  You got Latin gangs selling drugs left and right.  And it used to be, they tore it down a couple years ago, but there used to be a county jail right next to the Hall of Fame.  And the Greyhound bus station, right?  It's a joke.  Well, the county jail.  People all over the place.  They wanted to make it easy for the players to come and visit the guys that were getting in.  That's all I was doing. 
[02:02:00]  I'm watching Pat Riley go, thank you very much.  I'm looking at Akeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing, Adrian Dantley, all his players, and they were just sitting there.  And I'm going, what?  It was a pretty impressive class.  Where is it?  Somebody's house?  Some old lady's house?  Some old lady's house has made him a pie and said, come on in?  Bye.  Ant, you've never been there.  I don't understand why it's still in Springfield.  It just should not be there.  Well, because that's where it was invented.  Was Jabbar there?  Jabbar wasn't there, but he had everybody. 
[02:02:30]  Magic.  I mean, he had everybody.  Michael Thompson, James Worthy, they all were sitting there with their beautiful suits.  And you know they didn't even have a hotel that could hang their suits properly.  No.  No.  James Worthy have a prostitute with him?  How do you not love big game James?  Give me a hooker in Seattle, you.  You know he's in some smoking room because they ran out of rooms, so he's got to deal  with someone else's cigarette smoke.  It's amazing where these Hall of Fames are.  I'm never going to go to the Football Hall of Fame.  Hell no.  Let's go to Canton, Ohio, which is not even Cleveland. 
[02:03:00]  Where's Canton?  I wouldn't even be able to point out Canton on a map.  Who the hell?  For the God's honest truth.  Lance in Cincinnati, how are you?  Lance.  I'm pretty good, guys.  What's up, Lance?  Just a flare, Lance.  I grew up in Milwaukee, and we used to watch Bernie Brewer slide down that slide into the  beer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talk about political correctness.  Now he just goes down a longer slide and waves a flag.  That's what he should do.  Bernie Brewer is a douche. 
[02:03:30]  And they're going to change the shape of his nose, too, by the way, soon.  As soon as some mom goes, that looks like a thingy-majiggy.  You've seen that mascot, right?  He's got some funny-  I won't look at him.  Phallic nose.  Some uncircumcised face.  Look, there he is with the big, ridiculous, over-the-top yellow mustache.  I would actually turn away from the TV.  The Brewers are so inconsequential.  They just threw him in the National League.  They're like, you're not American leaguers anymore.  What do you mean the pitchers have to hit? 
[02:04:00]  You know what, Jimmy?  You're right.  But that's what I'm saying.  They used to be an ALT.  Don't get angry if you-  Like, these people are so devoted to fighting for their town.  It's like, look, just don't-  Pittsburgh stinks as a town.  But stop.  But the Steelers, I don't know why they're great and why you want to see them win.  Because Pittsburgh itself is kind of one of those-  If it wasn't for the Steelers, you would go, who wants to see-  The Brewers have a great stadium, though. 
[02:04:30]  Did you watch any of the games?  It's a sick-looking stadium.  All right, Lance.  It's freaking giant.  Yeah, thank you.  Hey, Matt, man.  Matt, man from Marblehead, Mass.  He writes, B.S.  Patrice, four teams from Boston have won more championships than any other city in the last 50 years.  But a lot of it happened before our lifetime.  Yes, yes.  The Celtics were won 11 championships from 50-  I don't know the exact days, but it was Bill Russell and Bob Cousy that whole time.  They didn't win after that.  That doesn't count because they had the two-hand set shot. 
[02:05:00]  Thank you.  They were white guys throwing hook shots.  Dunking was illegal.  They're wearing short shorts because they can because there were no African players yet.  It was only two black people in the whole NBA.  That was a small picture.  And two of them was on the Celtics.  Yeah, yeah.  And the Red Sox have never won, by the way.  Let's stop that.  And then the Patriots.  What is he talking about?  Well, a lot of Celtics victories.  But there were also six teams in the league.  Okay, my lifetime, the Celtics won 81, 84, 86. 
[02:05:30]  In 1981, 84, 86.  I'm 38 years old.  I was a young man.  Now I got to get my prostate checked since the Boston Celtics had won a championship.  There you go.  Since.  Wow.  Stop.  You need to check.  I know it dominated.  It's a heck of a race.  Nice poke as it falls on the floor.  You don't mind being spit on while it's checked.  What were you saying about Dominatrix, by the way, during the break, Jimmy?  Oh, just before that. 
[02:06:00]  I think it's a good time to go see one because they're right now, they're running for their lives  because they're busting some of them for being prostitutes, which most of them aren't.  But yeah, they said business down 70% in New York.  Down 70%.  Wait a minute, it's a crime to just stomp on somebody's nuts?  No, no, but I guess they were defining certain things as prostitution.  Maybe a couple of them were straying, but they were getting everybody for it.  So the argument is if I pay you to punch me in my nose, that's not prostitution?  Oh, it's not.  It's actually not.  But I mean, a couple of them would probably go over and do more than they were supposed 
[02:06:30]  to.  Yeah.  But you can pay a prostitute to do what a Dominatrix does.  Not as well, though.  A prostitute would be awful.  The Dom is good.  Well, that's why you have to say, you know, spell it out and say, what?  Not most of them.  Dominatrix?  Not at all.  Not one iota.  When we have them on the show sometimes, and they're like, okay, which one of you is going  to be my bitch?  I get the whip, and I'm just like, shut up.  I could turn around and snap your neck.  I don't have any guilt.  Don't kick me in my scrotum. 
[02:07:00]  I'm not a guilty guy.  I didn't do nothing to nobody.  I don't have guilt.  I don't fire people from their jobs.  You want me to stomp in my guts?  No.  I don't like this empowered, frigging violent, empowered chick thing.  I don't like my nipples pinched hard.  I don't like none of that pain.  Yeah, I'm going to whip you, but I'm going to show you, and then I'm going to hold back  and not give you anything.  Shut up.  Lay down and take it.  You're going to have a good Dom spit in your mouth.  Take it like a man.  I mean, if Dom holds your face and spits in your mouth properly, it can't be very sexy. 
[02:07:30]  I'm telling you.  How should I be sexy?  Spit it right back at her.  It can be.  How could I ever be sexy?  Are you kidding me?  The humiliation.  I'm being totally serious.  What did you do?  Why do you feel guilty?  You don't like a girl spit in your mouth.  Why do you?  No, I don't.  No, no, no.  But what you're into is humiliation, but why?  What did you do?  What is your problem?  I'm into that as one thing, but I'm also into humiliating.  I'm also into all of it.  It's like when you're hooked on something, you just go for all.  It's like drinking.  You can't say why you're hooked on vodka. 
[02:08:00]  I understand what you're saying, but being humiliated is a whole mentality.  It's a guilt thing.  It's like, what did you do to feel guilty about so that somebody can do certain things to you?  I don't know if it is a guilt thing, though.  I really don't know.  Or if it's just once you've done so many things, you just got to keep reaching and keep finding  other things to extend it.  But that's pain, though.  That dominates your thing.  I'm not into pain.  You're not into getting kicked in the kick?  No.  I'm not even a submissive, really.  Lightly.  I'm a light submissive.  You get tied up and all that?  No. 
[02:08:30]  What's the spitting in the mouth, though?  I really don't get that.  A kiss.  Spitting in the mouth is like a kiss.  I'm not against it.  I'm not against it.  No, no.  I said that's different.  When you're kissing and you're changing spit, it's different than her spitting in your mouth.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I'm not against that.  I'm not against it.  Wait, wait, wait.  You swallow spit all day long.  It comes out of your frigging saliva, your salivary glands, and you swallow it.  But you wouldn't spit in a glass and then drink it.  No, I wouldn't do that.  That's kind of right.  But it's the exact same thing.  Look at Stunt Brain.  He's trying to have that yucky, but he's a middle-aged white guy. 
[02:09:00]  You know he's into all kind of disgusting things.  This guy's had some clamps on him before.  I know his wife is probably in the trunk right now.  He lets him out when he gets home from there.  As long as it's done, it's good breath.  Good breath is very important, but good breath and mouthful of spit.  Oh, my God.  Does it feel like a slug or anything?  It's just, you know what?  I like that.  It spits in her mouth from her last client.  I like to watch girls, you know, mess with my nipples, lick my nipples.  It's just, watching girls do creepy stuff is really sexy. 
[02:09:30]  Just watching them do just stuff they can't do.  Like, they can be dirty right now, and they expect it, but girls just got to be girls all  the time.  And when you can get them to just do something horrifying.  I told you that time, I just, in England, I just saw a girl go behind a dumpster and just  pee.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I, my body was shaking.  I don't know why I was so horny watching.  That's like some kind of animal instinct that takes it over.  I don't know right now how that was.  And it was different.  And most doms, I'll say this, that I've met, were not particularly good. 
[02:10:00]  But the ones I've met that were good.  No one's such a businessman about a TCS thing.  I mean, the ones I've met that were good.  Dom's not good.  A woman who's really good at being a dominatrix.  I mean, the subtle stuff, like owning you sexually.  A good dom can own you sexually, because that's what every man wants.  We want a woman who we like, who can make us want to have sex.  I don't mean own you by spanking you, dominating you.  Ultimately, they're the E.  And when I say that, I can't.  They're the F-E.  When it all boils down to it, they're the F-E. 
[02:10:30]  When you're laying on the bathroom floor, you don't look at it that way.  You just open and swallow it as you've been instructed to do.  God.  I mean, I don't know what you would do.  Maybe you're belligerent.  I'm a man who listens.  Maybe you don't know how to follow instructions.  You don't want to be impolite, right?  Why would I?  Yeah.  I got a bag when I get stuff all off my own floor.  Oh, God damn.  I just don't get it.  I watched a video of this guy, this old man.  It was just two teenage girls just kicking him in his crotch.  Wow. 
[02:11:00]  And he just shaking with love.  Digging it.  It's like, I don't know, man.  Just loving it, right?  You don't even breathe hard next to my groin.  Don't even cough.  Be very careful.  That's the music.  We got to get out of here.  Patrice, thanks for the energy today.  We greatly appreciate it.  We're going to continue on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Jimmy's heading to JFK, right?  Oh, Jimmy.  Y'all packed up right now, Jim?  Yeah.  Look at his suitcase right there.  I got the Tonight Show tomorrow and then Chelsea Hammer on Wednesday. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  How could you have the Tonight Show tomorrow?  It's tonight.  But it's tomorrow.  Happy.  Are you on tonight?  Happy.  I'm on tomorrow.  Yeah, tomorrow.  You doing some stand-up or you just straight sit down?  Just sit down.  Straight to the couch.  Look at that.  Jim.  That's true.  Damn.  I'm very happy.  We'll see Jimmy later this week, all right?  I'll be back Thursday or Friday.  We look forward to the stories, my friend.  All right.  That's it.  All righty.  That's all we got.  Oh, by the way, one more thing. 
[02:12:00]  The Down and Dirty that air is on demand as of tonight.  People have been asking me who missed it.  It's on demand tonight, the Arty Lying episode.  And next week is Jim Jeffries, Dice, and Kevin Sher.  And Patrice is either in two weeks or three.  Nice.  And?  We didn't get to Andrew.  Cleveland also has the Poker Hall of Fame and the Softball Hall of Fame.  Delicious.  Softball Hall of Fame.  Oh, mighty.  We leave with Patrice.  What are we promoting, Patrice?  Addison, Texas, which is like the Dallas Improv, I think they're calling it. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  It's the Dallas Improv.  I'm there this weekend, Thursday through Sunday.  Very cool.  All right.  Have a good day.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's rock.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Patrice O'Neill has made the walk.  You say that so easy now.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Which means now they'll change the name of the company. 
[02:13:00]  I think the name change will happen.  I really do.  Yeah, you think they're going to change it to something that rolls off the tongue a little  easier than that?  I think XM makes more sense than Sirius, but Sirius, you know, had the hostile takeover, so they're  not going to use their name.  They're the honcho.  My God, man.  Hey, you want to pot up Sarah Palin's talking live right now?  Oh, is she?  Could be good.  Could be bad.  Let's see what she's doing right now.  Well, a lot of applause.  They load the audience up, is what they do with these things. 
[02:13:30]  Well, why would that work?  They don't let, uh, they don't leave it to chance.  Because that's the PC sound.  Oh, cable.  Thank you so much.  Oh.  Thanks, Dave.  Oh, you guys.  Thank you.  The applause.  They just, they load these audiences up.  Senator McCain, Senator McCain served our nation in uniform for 22 years.  Five and a half years, he was a POW. 
[02:14:00]  In fact, it was after graduating from the Naval Academy, he was stationed right here in Florida.  That's when he learned to do what he does here in Florida.  Pick shitty vice presidential candidates.  In Florida, it was in your skies that he trained to become a naval aviator.  And Senator McCain is proud to have been part of Florida's strong tradition of military service.  And today, we're proud of all the Floridians who have warned our country's uniform. 
[02:14:30]  Your state is home to millions.  To millions.  And I like your oranges.  Florida is home to millions of our veterans and many of our nation's active-duty soldiers and airmen.  And they continue to keep our nation strong and secure.  Hold pegs behind her.  And I know that here in the audience, there are veterans.  There are those who are serving today.  Would you do me the honor?  Raise your hand.  Let us applaud you. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, stop.  You phony.  She's like the easy pickup in a bar.  Oh, hell yeah.  You know you can just talk.  Show.  And she's getting a little drunk.  What do you want to do?  Yeah, you can talk circles around her.  Yeah.  Thank you.  And we love you guys.  Oh, it's a big flag behind her made of people's shirts.  Oh, wow.  See what they did?  See what they did there?  Should we bail on this?  Florida is just 29 days.  See what she says.  It will be the time for choosing in this election. 
[02:15:30]  And here's how I look at the choice that we face.  Oh, here we go.  There are some white people or change to just promote their careers.  And then there are those leaders of a bunch of black kids shaped as a fist.  That's Obama's.  This flag is a fucking knife cut on a white woman's throat.  That's what this flag made out of.  When principles and political independence matter a lot more than just the party line,  as Senator Lieberman just told you, it matters a lot more than just the party line. 
[02:16:00]  John McCain is his own man.  He doesn't run with Washington.  Who's the man of you?  And he and I don't just talk about change.  We're the only candidates in this race with a track record of actually making change happen.  Really?  See, by change, I think Obama means a black guy in the White House.  That's something you can't compete with.  As mayor and as a governor, I reminded people that government is not always the answer. 
[02:16:30]  Reading from whack bag.  She's like the leader of a pledge drive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get back to the show.  Send me my tote bag.  What?  You did?  I eliminated taxes on personal property.  All right.  And I eliminated taxes on...  You know what?  In four years, she's going to be worth a billion dollars from all the earrings she sells on  Home Shopping Network.  Let me show you my new brooch that I came out with.  It's a vice presidential loser brooch. 
[02:17:00]  And where are you at with this?  Because I know you don't like this broad.  I'm voting for the president of the United States.  I understand that.  I understand that.  I'm not voting for this bitch or stupid fucking leaky sprinkler of veins in his head Biden.  I'm voting for the fucking president.  And I think McCain is more my speed than Obama is.  Yeah.  I'm not gambling on who's going to croak in the fucking White House.  You know?  What happens? 
[02:17:30]  Yes, sir?  I'm really enjoying your food, obviously.  Besides that.  Good stuff.  Is that watermelon?  I don't eat watermelon.  I'm white.  I eat grapefruit.  That's the oldest racist joke in the book.  I know.  But I went with the swimming one, too.  Fried chicken.  Good.  Sorry about that.  Yes, sir?  Yes, sir.  Anthony's cooling down a little.  What do you mean?  Did you hear that?  What do you mean?  It was the same hate rhetoric.  Right.  But it was the same hate rhetoric.  I don't want to confuse that.  A little less inflammatory. 
[02:18:00]  It's more like a, it seems like a, this is what I got.  I'm almost a beaten man at this point.  You really are.  I feel.  Did you feel that a little bit, Ope?  Mm-hmm.  He goes, fuck that.  I'm not voting for.  See how you kind of, it's like, I'm not sure what the profile is, but you hate her.  Now you're like, fuck that.  I don't like her.  You wanted to just completely butcher, intrinsically, you're an honest man.  I try.  And you couldn't deal with the lie of supporting. 
[02:18:30]  No, I'm not going to sit here and go, she makes the great vice president.  She doesn't.  So you had to invent a new thing that I'm voting for the president, but let's be honest, you're  voting for the ticket.  No, I'm voting, I'm voting for my.  She will be your president if you vote.  If you're voting for him as president, you're also voting for her to be your president just  in case.  It's a gamble.  It's a crap shoot here.  It's a gamble.  I'm not going to bet on him dying in the next four years. 
[02:19:00]  That's what I'm doing.  That's what I'm doing.  I'm betting he stays alive for four years in the White House.  She does not become president.  By the way, stop with the hot shit with her.  Her stomach probably looks like lasagna.  Yeah, lasagna.  A tire tracks.  Oh, squirting all those kids out.  Oh, it looks like a horror film.  The end of a horror movie.  Yeah.  That's what her gut looks like.  It's awful.  Just a stretched out belly.  I am tired of that fucking hairdo.  I am tired of that beehive on her fucking head. 
[02:19:30]  Let that hair down.  When are they going to interview this bum of a husband that she has?  Yeah, that's what I want to hear.  Not a peep.  Not a peep out of that guy.  Because he's probably an adult.  An Alaskan fucking snowmobile riding dope.  And those kids aren't his?  I don't think all those kids are his.  Oh, gee.  Well, you probably ain't claiming the last one.  No, I'm saying.  I'm saying.  I'm not possibly sure.  I think that he's a stepdad type of dude.  Really?  I don't think that all the kids are his. 
[02:20:00]  I'm not saying that she's cheating.  I'm saying that she had kids with someone else?  I think she.  We would know that by now.  I don't think that came out, did it?  You got to look at mediatakeout.com.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  What is that?  One of those militant sites?  Nah, mediatakeout is like the black TMZ.  It's very popular.  Is it really?  Yeah.  I like the TMZ.  I got to check it out.  Black TMZ.  It's a fucking.  You should type it up, man.  The black media takeout, man.  It's really.  Media takeout?  It's fucking.  It's a really. 
[02:20:30]  Media takeout, yo.  Guilty pleasure, man.  And they'll tell you all the black news.  It's black news or black celebrity crap, all that.  Black celebrity.  But they'll throw in some shit about white people just to make sure people know about  it.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  I've been going to a lot of sites, too.  You know, different sites.  I go to, like, Aryan Nation sites and things like that.  Just to see what they're thinking.  Like, I want to know.  That's what every guy that goes there is.  No, I want to know, because like Patrice says, this white phoniness that's going around  with, oh, Obama, yes, you know, I'm voting Obama. 
[02:21:00]  And there's just this overall phoniness.  I want to see what the racists, the hardcore fucking racists are saying about this.  Have you ever met a reasonable, a reasonable racist?  Meaning, like, okay, I'm going to have, I have a reasonable discussion about race and  I'm racist.  Yeah.  Like these frothing at the mouth guys who actually will go, you know, you know, he's 
[02:21:30]  kind of good.  I like him, but he's a nigger.  I've heard reasonable racists.  Anthony, call me.  Oh, thank you.  Like, there's the skinheads that are just in a bit, you know, stomping on heads and stuff  like that.  And that, you know, that's just the company line there with them.  But then there's the people that really motivate those people through this, you know, what is  obviously hate speech, but they do it in a way that's very articulate.  It's very difficult to deal with.  You know what it is with white people? 
[02:22:00]  There's no, it's hard.  It's no gray area racist.  Like, meaning it's either you're a fucking animal.  Balls out fucking, like, yes.  With tattoos on your eyelids.  Yeah, right, right.  Somebody choking Selma from Good Times on your back.  A tattoo of somebody raping Selma from Good Times.  Or you're a guy who's never even thought the word in your life.  There's never a conversation, like that middle area racial, which is my thing, where there's 
[02:22:30]  racist and then there's racial.  Is that racist light racial?  Racial is just the fact.  I hear you use it a lot, but I don't really know what you mean by it.  It's a, I think racist is, I fucking hate you cause this, even if cause this is not legitimate.  I think racial is, you've, you've had life experience, you've had, like, for me, Asians, it's a racial thing with me. 
[02:23:00]  Okay, yeah.  If I've met some, and I'm gonna be honest, they're usually in San Francisco, the fast and the furious ones, who are not the ones I don't like.  And the ones when I deal with the ones I don't like, or even the Indians, the fucking Hindus, you know, I don't want anything bad to happen to them.  It's just, I go, oh, God.  You, like, sometimes, like, Indian women, I'm just being honest, man. 
[02:23:30]  The look they have, like, for me, I will be the villain to white people.  Like, I, I don't, I go, that's the way it is.  I'm gonna deal with that.  I don't like being the villain to some raggedy Indian woman who, who has these awful clothes, these giant genie pants, and this hot, this culture that treats them like dog shit.  And I'm the villain.  And you're the bad guy.  Look at your husband, look at your husband stinks, he's wearing, you know, he's had a top hat with pajama bottoms on, your kids are dressed all, and you're looking at me like I'm the villain of this country, which is, I think, what the media does to niggas, where, it's like, I'm the villain to these third world motherfuckers, and they treat me how white people treat me. 
[02:24:00]  Like, I don't want to go get treated like, by a fucking, the 14 year old girl, that, that's the daughter of the guy that owns the Chinese restaurant, and she treats me like shit. 
[02:24:30]  She can't speak English, but she's frustrated because she can't understand that I don't want onions in my motherfucking chicken fried rice.  You understand what I'm saying?  Are you still being treated like shit, though?  Like dog shit.  Are you really?  Purely based on race.  Purely based on race.  That's why I treat, I am, and this is the training, being in Boston.  Being in Boston, give me this training.  I know how to be a smarmy cocksucker.  I know how to annoy white people. 
[02:25:00]  Yes, you do.  Not just by being like a big black motherfucker walking down the street trying to scare you, but I really know how to look at you and go, ugh, I'm just better than you.  I know how to treat white people like shit.  I know how to be smarmy.  I know how to be condescending.  I know how to be arrogant, and I know how to go, ugh.  That's a smart way to get back at them, man.  This little passive aggressive little white girl, or whatever she was, was coming in with her, I gotta get the work card, and she was coming straight ahead, 
[02:25:30]  and I guess she thought I was supposed to move out her way.  Did not happen.  Ooh.  And I didn't go big nigger style on her.  No.  I went, not moving, and I went, I did the, I did the, I shooed her.  You shooed her with your hand, like, shoo.  I said, go that way.  Go away.  Yucky.  Did she give you the look?  Did she look at you all?  Yeah, like she was thinking the N-word instead?  Guaranteed she was thinking it.  She was thinking it.  Because ultimately, you know, she feels protected. 
[02:26:00]  Well, she should.  Nothing gonna happen to her.  Not there, yeah.  But I enjoy ruining the day.  And here's the thing.  I guess if you had to ask me something that really bothered me about society right now, really bothering me,  is the willingness.  And, you know, the $700 billion buyout, the banks closing, the this and the that.  You know who a lot of responsibility is?  Us.  If the president says, all right, look, America, you're getting ready to get fucked. 
[02:26:30]  You need the help of Americans to fuck America.  Yeah.  And the idea that there's so many people willing to fuck another person, to tell another person  you're fired, to tell another person that it's gonna cost you $500 a month for healthcare  and you only make $1,000 a month.  So you probably won't be able to get healthcare.  But for somebody to tell another motherfucker, I'm gonna, if they go, we're gonna take some 
[02:27:00]  of your 401k.  The president can't do that.  A fucking cocksucker.  One of your peers, one of your compadres has to push a button or call your home and threaten  to take your house.  Another person, another human being that hides behind, I'm, I gotta feed my family.  Do you think taking food out of another family's mouth ultimately helps your family? 
[02:27:30]  You fucking idiot.  You, you, you're just down with the system.  I mean, I say this, who was worse, who was worse, a guy who goes, you know, I don't like  Jews.  I want them all dead, but I need some help.  I need a whole bunch of motherfuckers to help me kill the Jews.  Right.  And every, and there's a line of motherfuckers willing to do that.  The people who are willing to fuck other people, like the president can say anything. 
[02:28:00]  Now, if you say, take, all right, take this motherfuckers money or you're fired.  Right.  And I go, nah, I'm not, I can't do this.  All right.  You're fired.  Then you're fired.  Then the next person takes it and you go, nah.  If we, at some point, and I know this is ridiculous cause it, it's just, it's not true.  But, but if we stopped fucking each other for just as something as bullshit nobility as 
[02:28:30]  my job, your job is to call my house and threaten to take it from me.  Your job is to tell me that, okay, there's something I call pre-existing.  I got diabetes, right?  So I didn't have my health insurance.  I would just pay my medicine straight out, go to the doctor, pay for that.  So I got health insurance, these motherfuckers tell me, this is my job, tell me, pre-existing  condition is you can't get healthcare if you already got some shit.  Which is just amazing, by the way, if you break it down. 
[02:29:00]  So I gotta, I gotta wait for a year with the disease that I have before I can get help  with my disease.  I wanna make sure you're not really fucked up.  You know, can we slow that point down just a second?  Cause that is amazing.  The whole reason you have healthcare is to, to, to try to get healthier if you do have  something, but they have come up with a way not to treat people that actually need.  It's like, we're the insurance company.  So you, you pay us money. 
[02:29:30]  Right.  And then if you need medical care, we pay for it.  Right.  Okay.  Uh, no, but if you have anything, we don't.  We want healthy people to pay us.  So we never have to pay out.  We just want you to pay in.  I want to really take some time with this.  And there's a person.  How did this get done in America?  There's a fucking person that you call.  Yeah.  And that motherfucker's job is to tell you that.  To tell you, well, you could.  At the airport, there's somebody's job to tell you, you gotta pay a hundred more dollars  to bring, uh, your bag on because it's not, it's 60 pounds. 
[02:30:00]  It's not 52 pounds.  Right.  Your job.  Right.  The plane.  Is to tell me that.  And the plane's still going to fly with the luggage.  Your job is to fuck other people.  But it's like you said.  That's why we're losing.  But it's like you said.  That's why we're losing.  But it's like you said, if they don't do it, then they lose their job.  That's the whole idea.  Yeah.  But your family, if you're willing to fuck my family for the sake of a company that's  fucking my family, your family's safe? 
[02:30:30]  You fucking idiot.  It's not for that moment.  People just live moment to moment.  Fucking stupid.  Yeah.  If your job is to fuck somebody else over to keep your family in food and shelter, people  are going to do it.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah.  You don't think of it like, uh, you know, they're another human being or that.  It's a fucking, it's a company asset that has to be, or a detriment.  But that's what happened to this guy, the cop that killed himself, that taser, he had  his humanity after the fact. 
[02:31:00]  He sat there, he go, God damn, this guy died for the sake of his job.  And I understand, I was talking about tasers, tasers, people are having heart attacks from  these fucking tasers.  Look, I got high blood pressure, I'm almost 40.  And I can understand, don't tase me, bro.  You know, don't tase me, you, you other guy that's just like me.  You're not better than me.  You're not any, you just took this job to, and now you have domain over my life to decide 
[02:31:30]  my fucking, my fate.  Well then lay the fuck down.  But people are laying down, dude, people are really saying, don't tase me, bro.  Motherfuckers are rampant with the tasering.  There's a taser, there's a taser problem.  It's, it's people that yell, don't tase me while they're still resisting.  Motherfuck, do I think Rodney King was, I've not seen one video.  Do you think Rodney King was resisting?  Fuck yeah.  I wish I, you know what, I wish I had a taser. 
[02:32:00]  Rodney King was a resisting motherfucker.  What, the part when he.  Especially the beginning of the part that wasn't videotaped.  You know what, Reginald Denny was resisting too.  Yeah.  He was moving, he should have just laid down.  Dummy.  Dummy should have fucking plowed through.  He should have road warrior those motherfuckers with the front of his truck.  You gotta, you gotta give it some time though.  The tasering thing is it's a new instrument, it's fun, so they're using it.  Yeah, a couple more years ago.  Motherfuckers are fun.  Motherfuckers are dying and now the police are killing themselves.  But these guys get their, because of that guilty con.  These guys get the new weapons and you have fun with it for a while. 
[02:32:30]  But this motherfucker, this motherfucker had a, he had a.  It's called less lethal, not non-lethal, by the way.  That's what, you know, some people are gonna die.  And those fucking beanbags that come out of guns.  Ow.  And fly as hard as a, as a bullet.  Fucking take out that girl's eye in Boston after they won the, uh.  Oh man.  Remember that shit?  Fucking cop.  Yeah.  Blasted her with some shotgun with a beanbag and went right through a fucking eyeball.  I thought they had every right to taser that guy.  The cops don't have all day to, to wait for the problem to take care of itself.  They're busy people. 
[02:33:00]  But evidently, if they, if it was righteous.  But they didn't do it, he wouldn't have killed himself.  That guy wouldn't have killed himself if it was a righteous call.  No, there's a whole thing going on.  We could get the NYPD on.  We did a whole discussion about this.  Oh, did you really?  The guy's life was fucked because he was gonna lose his pension and everything else.  Cause of that situation.  Yes.  He was gonna, he was losing everything.  Guilty feelings too.  The guy said, I mean, come on.  That was a little depression, man.  The guy, the guy we talked to said, you know, 99% of the time that guy would have fallen  off that little awning thing and landed on his fat ass and they'd have cuffed him and 
[02:33:30]  it would have been over.  He landed on his fucking head perfectly to kill him.  He wasn't even that high up.  If you look at it, he's on a little fucking, he's on those metal grates, the top of the  metal grate they pull down in front of stores in bad neighborhoods.  That's where he fucking was.  So he falls off, cracks his fucking head open and now this guy feels guilty about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He feels guilty about it.  Yeah.  He felt guilty.  That's natural.  I'm not gonna say this motherfucker should have blew his brains out, but he's, he fucking  felt so guilty.  You know why?  Wait a minute.  I'm gonna tell you what the guilt is. 
[02:34:00]  The guilt is the, the fact that you, somebody gave you a job.  Let's say the meter maids.  Somebody gave you a job that, you know, you have domain over my life and you make a decision  dude to be godly about it.  You make a decision to fuck me cause you have the power to fuck me and it, and it, and you  love it.  The, the tall people like you, you just drive through and you just go, you just, your job 
[02:34:30]  is to tell me that I'm paying $8 when I was playing four yesterday.  That's your job.  You just, Hey, it's just my job, but it ain't just their job.  You know it, Anthony.  But they didn't make the fucking rate.  I don't like them either.  I know cops that police work is their job and they, and they have an ethic about it and  they're nice dudes, man.  And I know some motherfuckers, it ain't their fucking job.  They're just in it for the, yeah.  It's in it for the, for the tarra, man. 
[02:35:00]  And that's the terrible thing is that if you're not lucky enough to know Kenny or know Keith  or know motherfuckers that I know in, in, in the hood, if I'm not, if I don't know how  to make this man's face mean something to me as opposed to some cop, cause there's a  lot of motherfuckers that the police are just a motherfucking some cop.  So this guy who kills himself, a lot of motherfuckers can't go into, Oh man, this dude is family.  They did this to all they look at is good. 
[02:35:30]  Good.  Again, that's the OJ verdict.  A lot of people, black people don't give a fuck about OJ.  It's just like, Oh, thank God a nigga beat the system.  It just, it really, we're willing, black people willing to take away that humanity part, which  is the right and the wrong, just to get a little goddamn something out of this.  It is what it is.  We got our something the other day.  So it works both ways.  Now we're like, Hey, go into your, Oh, they hung up. 
[02:36:00]  God damn it.  I wanted that call too.  Some, uh, some guy called his wife had to like, uh, collect money from cancer patients.  I don't know the exact reasoning of that.  And she had to quit the job cause she just couldn't do it anymore.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Probably some kind of insurance thing.  Go with your point.  You know, her whole job is to not only fuck over people, fuck over people that are dying.  Well, some people can't take, yeah.  Some people can't take those jobs.  Others live for it.  And they just, and others, yeah, they're, they're made for it.  I mean, I, I, uh, bring, bring and race into it again.  Uh, when you get a black woman on the phone, when you are looking for help, you are not 
[02:36:30]  going to fucking get help.  That's, I'm sorry.  That's just the way it is.  You're not fucking getting help.  And I don't know why that is, but you know, the best, the best helpers are on the phone  are first black guys.  I'm telling you black guys.  Cause we don't give a fuck, but we're going to do our job to the point where we need to 
[02:37:00]  do it.  Well, and, and white guys.  Yeah.  I think women, it's kind of onto something.  Women as service people are the worst.  All women.  It's a power thing.  Black women just bug you.  And I hate the ones that try to sound white.  Like, uh, man, this is, this is Citibank, man.  And this is, this is Carlotta, Citibank.  May I help you?  Have a, and, and man, have I been helpful at the end of this call? 
[02:37:30]  No, bitch.  You haven't been helped.  I try to make life miserable for motherfuckers who make miserable, life miserable for me.  Here's my nightmare when I'm on the fucking phone.  Uh, did you unplug the box for five minutes and then plug it back in?  That's cable.  Yeah, I did that.  I know that part.  Of course I did.  That's like the first thing I do every time.  That's the only thing I know.  Did you pull a card out the front and then put it back?  Yeah, I did all that, too. 
[02:38:00]  Can I, can I speak to a tech, to a tech guy that does this?  Somebody better than you, bitch?  Yeah, I need someone better than you that knows the, knows the machine.  Do you know the machine I'm even talking about and what's inside it and how it works?  And what, that's the guy I need to talk to, a tech.  Someone that went to school for it.  I used to say, are you, miss, are you, are you, let me ask you a question.  You, you won't help me?  Or you can't help me? 
[02:38:30]  Just tell me which one it is.  Yeah.  If you can't help me, then that's cool.  Yeah.  But is it, you won't help me?  You won't help me.  You fucking asshole.  And they always end up going.  And they read the computers.  That's all they're doing.  Look, you don't need to start talking like that to me.  Calm down, sir.  They know that all, because they know, it's, it's, they've been run through that 20 fucking  thousand times.  You don't need to.  And I hate being told to calm down when I'm not un-calm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  Sarcasm is not evil.  You need to fucking wait until I really jump on your ass to pull out the calm down.  We ain't close to that yet.  Oh.  Could you please calm down, sir?  Calm, calm.  I was fucking talking.  I'm not even much of enough.  Now I'm pissed.  Now I'm pissed, you fucking bitch.  Yep.  Yep.  I call him stupid.  Stupid is my favorite thing.  Hey, stupid.  And I say, what shitty part of America are you from?  Because there's always somebody from Louisiana answering my fucking phone.  And I'm like, you don't even, I said, I don't trust you having my credit card number 
[02:39:30]  when I'm giving it over the phone.  As you're hearing the clicking of a computer thing, you get like, so how's the weather in  New York?  Yeah.  Do you think I want to fucking discuss the weather with you?  Type faster.  Whatever you're doing to fucking tell me the wrong answer.  That's their job.  Yeah.  They feel comfortable.  Like the TSA, I mean, like I said, I go to the airport.  If I have a flight at eight at night, I go to the airport at four. 
[02:40:00]  Right.  Because I know I'm an asshole.  There's problems.  I practice being an asshole at the airport.  It is what it is.  I try to find out what you can do and what you can't do at the airport.  What I know.  He's doing recon for everybody.  What I do know is this.  You can't say nothing about bombs.  No, never.  Can't fuck around with bombs.  Can't fuck around with I'm going to do that.  What you can do is insult them. 
[02:40:30]  What you can do is say, boy, you're stupid.  What you can do is choose to take a full body search if you don't want to dress butt naked.  I had to take my belt off one day and I go, go get your go get your supervisor because I want to see the rules.  Tell me to bring the rules, too.  I want to make sure.  Oh, shit.  You're that guy.  I'm that guy.  Oh, no.  I'm a middle-aged white guy at the airport.  I want to see the book.  Here comes a guy.  Here's what the fear is at the airport. 
[02:41:00]  One, two things they use.  One, you got to fly.  You got to get the fuck out of there.  Yeah.  So that's why I go 18 hours before I go fly.  So you're on a time constraint.  Two is your lack of understanding for what power they have.  The guy comes over and he says to me, your job is to do what we tell you.  I said, that's not my job.  Get out of my face.  Oh, shit.  Get out of my face.  I'm serious.  Get out of my face.  That's not your job.  Your job is not to tell me what to do. 
[02:41:30]  Your job is to keep me safe.  Now, this guy told me to take my belt off.  And I'm not being, I'm being, now I'm telling you this because this is the real me talking  about it.  But at the airport, I'm like, that's not your job.  I'm arrogant.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm really white guy-ish.  I go, because I travel a lot.  Some places tell me to take my belt off.  Some people don't.  I want to see where it says that I have to remove my belt. 
[02:42:00]  Where does it say that?  That I have to remove my belt.  My job is not to tell you.  So I go, your job is to get somebody else that can help me then.  Because he was a nobody.  So he had to get another girl.  Now, here's, you know, a little girl there.  And I'm not even looking.  Anytime a girl is of authority, I don't look in her face.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  Oh, you're terrible.  Hold on.  I dismiss her existence.  Just for the record, I'm the same fucking way. 
[02:42:30]  I don't know what it is.  When a girl comes to berate me, I look away.  That's why I can't look at the TV right now.  Wow.  I'm looking at the floor.  You are awful.  I don't look at him.  So they finally came out with a guy.  I knew he was gangster.  He had a nice suit on.  Rolex.  Real powerful shape.  Small guy.  Like, not afraid.  So he came out.  He was watching me do my thing.  And he was just listening.  And he just knew I was right.  He knew I was right.  And I go, I go, I'm not, I'm not, I'm complying. 
[02:43:00]  Dude, the shoes.  Was he a black guy?  No, white guy.  He was a white guy?  Got to take the shoes off.  I take the motherfucking shoes off.  I hate taking the shoes off.  By the way, the fastest way to get to the airport is to come dressed just like an Arab.  Holy shit.  Sandals and a big shirt.  No belt.  No belt.  No shoes.  Nothing.  Wow, that's fucking perfect. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  It doesn't get better.  Dressed like an Arab.  That's the fastest way to get to the airport.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Has that been true?  God damn.  Why hasn't anyone even fucking realized that?  Didn't even just pull up the robe real fast?  Just dressed like them.  That's hilarious.  Oh.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Ultimately, this guy, I took my belt off and the guy comes.  This is the boss.  You can tell you the boss after this guy.  And let me tell you, the dude that kept telling me, you to do what I tell you to. 
[02:44:00]  He started having a conversation with his security, his supervisor, telling him the story.  And I go, that's not what happened.  He goes, be quiet.  I go, that's not what happened, what you're saying.  He said he had to pull her away because he knew that his technique was not working because he was wrong.  He had no authority.  Yeah.  So he couldn't tell me to shut up.  He had to go over in the corner to talk to this girl. 
[02:44:30]  To get away from you.  To get away from my, my needling.  You need a hobby, man.  Needling?  My needling.  I fucking hate people that have domain over my life.  You do understand that.  I fucking hate arbitrary people.  But you do understand that that is part of a society.  Wait a minute, this guy, though, was cool.  And I'm sitting here talking to him, real, and I'm putting my belt on.  And I stop putting my belt on. 
[02:45:00]  I go, sir, this is fucking embarrassing that I'm redressing in front of you.  Do you understand what a man I don't feel like?  Let me tell you something.  Right now, you take your fucking belt off.  You said this?  No, I'm talking to you right now.  If you take your belt off, Opie, right now, in front of us and have to put it back on,  it's embarrassing.  To redress.  I came out the house with my clothes.  Here's the thing I love doing.  Because you can go through the, if you can keep your hat on for religious purposes, 
[02:45:30]  you can absolutely do this.  I'm telling you, I'm not setting people up to get in trouble.  If you have a hat on, you can go, I'll keep it on.  Take your hat off, please.  Nah.  Nope.  I'll take a check.  I keep my jewelry on.  I keep my, I keep everything on me.  And then what do they do?  They wand you or some shit?  If you beep.  That's if you beep.  But my hat, if, well, this one, no, because it got a metal thing on. 
[02:46:00]  But my regular hats, I go through, they go, can you, but see, they don't go, you, you,  you have to take your hat off.  Can you remove your hat, sir?  Take your hat off or remove your hat, sir.  Or, nah, I don't want to.  Because you're not required, you're required to take off your belt.  I mean, not your belt, your shoes and your jacket, an outer jacket, anything or a sweater.  You got to take that off.  You can't go through, you can't fight that.  Hat you can keep on.  And if they tell you to take it off, you can say it's religious purposes too. 
[02:46:30]  You can keep your hat on.  By the way, religious purposes, you can keep your hat on.  So they don't make a Jew take off the yarmulke and they can't make a Sikh take off his turban.  Can't do it.  So this is my religious hat right here.  So I go, I'm not taking my hat off.  And your belt, there's decisions that they can make to make you take off.  They can make a call.  Yeah, yeah.  Their own call.  But that's like what the police do.  See, people think they can say things to police.  Police have a term called disorderly. 
[02:47:00]  Disorderly.  Which destroys any of your knowledge for police.  I know my rights.  I know that bullshit.  If you go get the fuck out of here and you go start talking shit, disorderly.  Beat it.  That just waves off all your bullshit.  Yeah.  So basically, what they do is they can make decisions on what to make you take off and not take off.  They can.  And then I start talking to this guy. 
[02:47:30]  I go, look, man, you motherfuckers are getting.  He was cool as shit, by the way.  I wish I knew his name.  Because I say his name.  Nice guy.  I go, man, you motherfuckers are getting sued, man.  These motherfuckers are making women strip, taking out nipple rings and shit.  You motherfuckers is crazy.  And he goes, man, look, how many people a year do you think we see?  Now, I go, I don't know.  I said some goofy shit.  I don't know.  I'm looking at it.  I'm trying to add it up in my head.  Yeah, right.  He goes, 30 million people, man. 
[02:48:00]  And he said, we can't make one mistake.  I said, fair enough.  Shook his hand.  I said, fair enough.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  But I would like to know what the fuck I can do to maintain my dignity so I don't have to have a Mexican girl tell me to take off my fucking belt.  Then don't wear a fucking belt for the airport.  Fuck you.  I'm wearing my belt for the fucking thing.  This is what I'm saying. 
[02:48:30]  We're willing.  This is why right now, this $700 billion fucking Bible, man, this shit is, the government runs the country now.  We're not capitalists right now.  The government runs our fucking country.  And people go, meh, like, don't wear a belt.  You can't be that white, Anthony, where you just say, leave your, don't wear a belt.  All I'm saying is, I remember a fucking time where if I was getting on a plane as a kid or a relative was getting on a plane, I could fucking walk them right up to the fucking plane. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  But people fucked that up for us.  No, people didn't.  Yes, they did.  Some fucking assholes that flew a plane, but the people, let me tell you something, man.  They fucked it up for us.  After, no one sits there and tomorrow they go, here's the plan.  First of all, the fucking TSA are just like bitches.  They are reactive to the proactive terrorists. 
[02:49:30]  There's a guy right now in the basement trying to figure out how to kill me with shampoo.  And this fat bitch from Newark is my first line of defense.  That's what makes me mad.  Yeah.  Is that I don't feel safer.  You're right.  That's what bugs me.  That, you're absolutely right.  I don't feel any safer because I'm like, you're fucking dumb.  You're dumb.  You're not smart. 
[02:50:00]  You're not my protection.  You fat bitch.  Matter of fact, I'm fat.  I wouldn't have anybody fat working any place that had protection.  Some fat bitch is not protecting me.  You know why?  Because you're lazy.  I'm fat.  I'm too lazy to do anything that takes me on my feet for eight hours to protect you from  a motherfucker who is in the desert doing push-ups and trying to blow himself up.  Suck my dick.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  I'll give you that.  That's a great point, Patrice. 
[02:50:30]  I'm serious.  I wouldn't hire me to work security.  See, I'm sleepy at certain times of the day.  I get very sleepy at three in the afternoon.  That's when terrorists, I read a book, terrorists try to kill us mostly at three in the afternoon.  And that's when I'm my tiredest.  Some bitch that came to work at seven, she wants to run home to see the last bit of Maury  Povich is my defense system.  False sense of security.  Suck my balls.  False sense.  We have it in this building.  We got to go through a security guy downstairs. 
[02:51:00]  What is he going to do?  Who's arbitrary, by the way.  What the fuck is he going to do?  Some days that guy's like, sign in.  Who are you?  Some days he's like, hey, how you doing?  Doodly doo.  All right.  I hate that fucking guy.  What happened?  No, no, no.  See, now.  But he's nice.  He knows Anthony, though, because he goes, Anthony went up already.  Yeah.  Likes you, but that's what I'm saying.  That's the thing.  Likes you, life is good.  Don't like you, life is bad.  That can't be.  I don't like him.  I haven't acknowledged that guy in two years. 
[02:51:30]  What?  The guy at the desk?  I hate that fucking guy.  See, I acknowledge him every day.  I say, have a nice day, have a good evening, and I never have a puff.  He calls you an antipuss.  Why have a problem with somebody like that?  Because, and I'll tell you why.  I'll give you, it's not worth the aggravation.  Listen, having some kind of a fucking problem with the guy at the desk in a building you  work in is so counterproductive, I could think of 20 other people that I could have  a fucking problem with that would be more, you know, would benefit me better than that 
[02:52:00]  guy.  I'll go with that.  So, I don't fucking, it's not like I go, I'm not bringing him cake, but I'm not fucking,  you know, I'm not giving him a snide remark, I'm not making faces at him, because I don't  give a shit.  Right.  Here's something that's very funny, and I have to address this, because I guess Keith  is listening.  Hope he is.  I wouldn't come home today.  Ange, it's Keith's wife, she does the decorating in my house and stuff, and Keith does a lot 
[02:52:30]  of the business end of things.  He's like my personal assistant kind of thing.  One thing that is done is my laundry gets done, which is nice, I don't have to do my  laundry, I'm paying people, it's not like I'm looking for a freebie, but do my laundry.  So, it says, Ange says next time she sees laundry on the floor, instead of the hamper,  she's burning it.  And now here's why I purposefully, on purpose, put my laundry on the floor next to my bed. 
[02:53:00]  Because they took my hamper, Keith and Ange, took my hamper out of the bathroom, and put  it in my bedroom next to my bed, going, like I'm a fucking child, going, maybe if the hamper's  closer to where he takes it off, he'll put it in the hamper.  I saw the fucking hamper, I didn't put it in on purpose.  Wait a minute, you allow these two to get so involved in your life, though. 
[02:53:30]  But that's why I'm in it, did you fucking get laundry?  Do you hear this motherfucker, right?  He just finished, do you hear the battle he's fighting?  The ridiculous pride that he just took, and that principle, that useless principle you  just had, do you understand?  It's my fucking house.  Good is good if it's good for me.  Like, fucking, you just went off on, you had to make a point, to, instead of, this is  what this motherfucker just said, don't fuck your problems.  Battles.  You couldn't, you had a passive-aggressive battle with Keith, who's on your side, his 
[02:54:00]  wife, who's on your side, and all you had to do was go, hey Keith, man, listen, I saw  the hamper, I'm not a kid, I pay you guys to do what you do, you're missing something  here, though, he's finally putting his foot down, now that Keith has at least two rooms  to himself in the house, you know, finally he's putting his foot down.  Put that fucking hamper in there, like I'm their eight-year-old son, who fucking doesn't 
[02:54:30]  put his laundry away.  I'll put my fucking laundry on my roof, I'll put it on my fucking roof.  Oh, now he's talking tough, as Keith drives his cars and lives in his rooms.  Oh, how happy, how happy is Keith to put flat-screen TVs on the wall on your dime?  Oh, he's so happy, he's back in the fold.  Oh, he's so happy.  He's back in.  Fred Goldman.  And unfortunately, in this case, or fortunately, as far as I'm concerned, he's found guilty 
[02:55:00]  and maybe he'll spend the rest of his life in jail.  So, Kim, when you heard the news, that that was a podcast.  There you go.  He's the most unlikable victim in the history of podcasts.  Oh, isn't he?  Ron Goldman.  He really is.  He just goes, oh boy, he should have another advocate for his son.  It's like Doc Holliday.  We got to take a break.  I think we're going to do a little Jocktober today.  Oh, Jocktober, where we take a random show from around the country and showcase it for  the shit that they are.  We kind of were going to blow it off today, take a little break, but this show is talking 
[02:55:30]  about relationships and getting engaged and all that, and it's right down Patrice's alley,  I do believe.  So, we're going to look at the B Morning Coffee Club out of Rochester, New York for Jocktober  after the break.  All right.  And other things.  Stay there.  Rock and roll.  Opie and Anthony.  Dow Jones down 315 points in early trading.  Wow.  Trading, excuse me.  Dipping below 10,000 for the first time, and who the fuck knows. 
[02:56:00]  And we're saying, remember when we were pushing 15,000?  Oh, they were going, yeah, Dow 15, we're going to 15,000, I wouldn't worry about it.  That's fucking some shyster dick douchebag over at Bank of America.  They decide when you go in there and want to make a transaction that they got to try to  fucking suck you into this investment thing.  So, this guy is like, well, who's your, it started with the teller, one of these tellers  goes, who's your money manager?  I go, I don't know, I am. 
[02:56:30]  He goes, oh, well, no, this person's your money manager, so set up an appointment, and  he'll talk about, you know, some options you have.  And I sat down with this motherfucker, and he goes, what are you looking to do?  I go, I'm a conservative guy.  I'm very conservative.  I don't want my money in things that are going to gain or lose value very quickly.  I'm a steady as she goes kind of guy.  All right.  Do you know where the Dow's going to be in three months?  Let me tell you.  Oh, you know fucking Kreskin?  So, it turns out this motherfucker.  So, is 15 better than 10? 
[02:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  Way better.  Up is good.  This isn't golf.  Greed is good.  So, this motherfucker goes, okay, come in next week, and I'll put together some type  of thing that I think you should be in.  So, I go back.  He's got me, like, he didn't have me, but he had this layout that he had, this plan for  me, was loaded with stocks.  Loaded.  And I said, this is exactly the opposite of what I fucking told you I wanted.  Can you live off your interest?  At this point, with fucking the way interest is, eh, not the lifestyle I'm accustomed to. 
[02:57:30]  Have you seen his house?  That mortgage is a bitch.  What's the interest rates right now at a bank?  You're getting shit.  What are we getting fucking?  Maybe.  Tree?  Yeah.  This is really bad.  You used to be, you used to be 10.  It used to be like 10%.  You could sit there and just fucking, wah, wah, look at us.  We got plenty rolling in on interest.  Now?  No.  You can't.  You can't.  You need, like, fucking huge amounts of millions. 
[02:58:00]  Let's change gears.  Um, get out of this, uh, depression that is, uh, our future.  Ooh.  Financial future.  It's, it's Jocktober, eh?  It is Jocktober.  It's Jocktober.  I love Jocktober.  Let's make fun of somebody else to make ourselves feel better.  About ourselves.  Right?  Yes.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  I wanna rock!  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows. 
[02:58:30]  The DJs from across this great nation of ours.  I'm wearing panties to this party.  I've never seen a better antonym of hysterical.  Crack up the crapola.  It's Jocktober on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It was the yang for the yin.  Yes.  It was the polar opposite.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, Jocktober is here.  By the way, the Dow went under 10,000 in October 2004. 
[02:59:00]  That was the last time.  Four years ago.  Ah.  Wow.  Where did my...  Wow.  Hello?  Wow.  Why did that sound fun?  Oh, because I turned it down because that was so loud.  Yeah, that sweeper was ridiculous.  That's better.  Sam, who are we looking at today?  Today, we're going to Rochester, New York.  The home of Brother Wee's.  Yes.  When you mentioned Rochester, you mentioned the home of Brother Wee's.  The home of Brother Wee's and the home of the Bee Morning Coffee Club.  Ooh.  On WBEE 92.5. 
[02:59:30]  Ooh.  Mm-hmm.  What do we know about them?  And what are they?  Isn't that a country station?  Yeah, it's a country station.  I remember back in the day it was.  But they like to spend the mornings playing some country music, having some laughs, and  making you feel, you know, good to wake up.  All right.  And it's Terry, Steve, and Newman?  Yeah, Terry, Steve, and Newman.  I think they call him Terry Bird.  Okay.  And this starts with a promo the show uses to show how funny they are? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, like while the show is running, they go into breaks sometimes with promos of kind  of the big laughs that they've had in the past.  Okay.  And that's what this is.  All right.  Strap in, kids.  It's Jocktober.  Good morning, Terry Clifford.  Well, good morning, Steve.  How's it?  Oh, this is Terry Clifford.  We made fun of her.  We have?  Yeah.  When we were in the running to be the biggest show in Rochester.  Yes.  All right.  Okay.  Wasn't she the piggy pig looking one?  She has a really hot voice, but not real hot voice, but a nice voice, but she's just 
[03:00:30]  a mess of a lady.  She's an extremely large woman.  You remember it, don't you?  Yeah.  All right.  Good morning, Terry Clifford.  Well, good morning, Steve.  And hi, Jeremy.  Hi, guys.  Have a good night.  Everything okay?  In our little worlds?  Yeah, pretty good.  Anything we have to tell anyone?  Um, why?  What do you know?  Well, no, no, I just...  The B Morning Coffee Club.  Weekday mornings, 5.30 till 10 a.m.  On 92.5 WBE. 
[03:01:00]  Wait, what was the laughing for?  Why were they laughing?  They said, why?  What do you know?  And then they laughed at that?  And then there was a big, like, guffaw.  But where's the joke?  Why?  They said, anything to tell us about?  And say, why?  Well, maybe, but what do you know?  I don't want to get in over my head.  Yeah.  Because imagine...  Just imagine...  Oh, oh, the crazy...  That's...  You're talking crazy now.  Yeah.  Oof.  Any examples of the, uh...  Holy shit.  Humor?  What?  What, Patrice?  Radio just... 
[03:01:30]  It's horrid.  Well, that's why we have to do this.  It's horrid.  They just can't be real.  But let me ask you...  Ask.  Okay.  Just don't blow up our bit.  We need 20 more days of this.  You don't have a tendency of being so logical.  We're like, fuck.  We can't do the bit anymore.  Ruined it.  Right.  That's the question.  All right, then go.  Because I can't tell if it is...  We're a real show.  It's fine.  You guys have been soldiering for a long time, right?  Mm-hmm.  Um...  How many out of...  Let's say you tend to these. 
[03:02:00]  How many out of them are that?  Even if you gave them free reign.  What do you mean?  To be funny as they could be.  And how many have to be that?  Have to be?  Have to be?  That they are.  No, they're really that.  Yeah, yeah.  There's no...  What is Patrice saying?  You know what I'm saying?  We're just picking out the bad stuff?  Like, you know...  No, no, no.  You know what I'm...  No, like, do they go in there and go,  Oh, fuck.  I gotta put on this face again.  Right, like, if you gave them...  If you gave them carte blanche, they'd be geniuses. 
[03:02:30]  No.  They are just...  No, because you know why?  Because they...  This show we're listening to, they think they're geniuses.  That's the problem.  But geniuses under the fucking...  Under the umbrella of you have to be not funny.  This is as funny as you can be to not offend anybody.  Don't talk about shit.  They're funny for that.  Or, um...  Or this is it.  Even if you...  If you put them on XM, that is it.  Then they're unloading? 
[03:03:00]  No.  They're just...  They're just unfunny.  Not creative.  They're hacky.  They're...  There's...  Oh, God.  Remember?  Now I remember.  Boy, did we make fun of every inch of her.  And there sure is a lot.  This...  She has to be funny.  A person that looks like that has to have a sense of humor.  That is...  I refuse to believe she's not a funny person.  Frederica Bimmel.  Oh, my God.  She's even worse than I remember.  She looks like...  She looks like two of the fat ones from the Facts of Life. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Put together.  Put together.  Two of the fat ones from the Facts of Life.  She's a morphed version of retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Sure.  Both of them put together in one person.  She's so ugly, I got hiccups now.  I was laughing really hard at her ugliness.  I'll tell you what she looks like.  A fat Moe from the Simpsons.  A fat Moe from the Simpsons.  Moe that owns the bar.  Yep. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, is she awful?  Wow.  And we determined she's a flatso.  Yeah, which is the worst.  She's very big, but she doesn't have big tits, which makes her a flatso.  There's a lot of...  I think it's the way the picture's being pagan.  I see them.  I see where they're at.  They're just a little...  If you push them up, there'll be a nice tit.  Why is she wearing the lace on her arms?  Or is that just their arms and stretch marks?  Well, that's what they sell at Lane Bryant.  That's just straight out the fabric, Anthony. 
[03:04:30]  It's what Stephen Carr used to wear.  Oh, that is Stephen Carr.  Holy shit.  It didn't start as lace.  No.  No.  All right.  No, Patrice, there's a head...  Holy shit, who's this face?  This face belongs to somebody, man.  Isn't that great?  It's haunting me.  Well, if you...  First of all, it's a guy's face.  Yes.  She's definitely manly.  If you look just at the face, it's a manly face.  She looks like a weatherman from...  Yeah.  It's just something going on.  I know her face.  Wow.  That face is... 
[03:05:00]  I think it's John Kruk.  It's a little Drew Carey.  Drew Carey-ish?  A little Drew Carey.  Yeah, if you just...  All right.  It's also like Mike from Don and Mike.  A little Mike-ish?  Yeah.  I know that fucking face.  All right.  Keep it up there and we'll figure it out.  Maybe she was a man.  A big fat man?  Maybe.  Damn, I know that face.  So make me a woman, but don't make me any prettier than a man.  This Jocktober thing is easy pickings because most shows suck.  There's a handful of shows that get the job done. 
[03:05:30]  All right.  We continue with the Bee Morning Coffee Club.  Yes, they spent...  They're a coffee club, Sam.  Well, they're the coffee club.  That's so nice because, you know, they're on their mornings.  What are you laughing at?  Let's do it in the cheek.  It's kind of Drew Carey.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my God.  It's kind of close.  Oh, shit.  I'm squinting and covering up her awful wig.  Oh, fuck me.  Is that a wig?  That can't be her real hair.  That's a little Chris Farley, too.  A little Farley in her? 
[03:06:00]  Holy fuck.  It is Chris Farley.  A little Farley in her.  Farley.  Safe to say, she's a beast.  All right.  Newman.  Newman talks about getting engaged.  We find out whether or not Terry is a hole.  Yeah.  Well, they spent the entire show today because I guess Newman got engaged, you know, to his  fiance.  But when I was doing radio in Rochester, he was old.  No, I think there's a different...  It must be a different Newman.  All right.  It must be.  It sounds like a young guy.  And, yeah, he just got engaged. 
[03:06:30]  So they spent four and a half hours talking about it.  Wait, what are we looking at?  Fucking Farley.  Look at that.  Look at the big one with his...  Yeah, that one.  It's gray.  Yeah, we're looking at Farley.  Fucking Farley.  Oh, fuck me, man.  It's Tommy Yuck.  Oh, fuck that poor woman, man.  I can't even do it.  I can't join in with you, fellas.  This poor woman.  This poor woman, man.  She is awful.  She's such a victim, man. 
[03:07:00]  It's such a victim.  This is all she has.  Everything on her is awful.  This is all she has.  I got to listen to this shit, because if she's a drop of nice, I can't join in.  All right.  This bitch...  I know.  She's overly nice.  Oh, could this...  That's the problem.  You feel bad.  You just got to feel bad.  I don't give a shit.  Look at this bitch.  I don't care.  I'd kick her in the teeth if I could.  She should go on, Mike, and just, like, spill her guts out about her problems.  About how it was growing up just being like the fucking girl no one went with her.  Her unhappiness would make her a genius. 
[03:07:30]  Right.  Don't be happy and...  Oh, because I'm unhappy for her.  I'm really unhappy for her.  Talk about high school and how you were just shunned.  She looks like Costello.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she does look like Costello.  Oh, my God.  Or, um, Ollie.  Oliver.  Yeah.  Laura Hardy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm eating another pie. 
[03:08:00]  She's a fucking mess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't we, uh...  Ugh.  Let's listen to the next clip.  I gotta hear some of this.  All right.  All right.  This is the B-Morning Coffee Club.  It's the coffee club.  You drink your coffee with us.  All right.  Newman talks about getting engaged.  We find out whether or not Terry's a hole.  You be the judge based on her reaction.  We all know the definition of the hole at this point, right?  Of course.  So, it's like, literally, I feel like a different dude from one night to the next.  Good for you.  I am so happy for the both of you. 
[03:08:30]  And she is just a lovely, lovely woman.  She is the perfect woman for you.  She's so hot, too, Bird.  You've seen her, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's what's inside that counts with her.  All right?  I know, really.  Whatever.  Yeah, it is.  If she's hot, that helps.  Oh.  But it's cool and...  It's incorrigible.  Incourigible.  You know what?  I'm going to give that guy a gold star because he's saying how hot this other guy's chick  is in front of the big slob. 
[03:09:00]  That takes balls.  I didn't even think about that.  Yeah.  Well, listen again.  Knowing the girl giving all the niceness there is just...  She's not even a one.  No.  She's not even on the scale yet.  The one to ten scale.  So, it's like, literally, I feel like a different dude from one night to the next.  Good for you.  I am so happy for the both of you.  Ugh.  And she is just a lovely, lovely woman.  She is the perfect woman for you.  Now, the one saying that is, have we stressed how awful she is? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  We can't possibly stress how awful she is.  Is she the lead person on the show?  I don't know.  She might be.  It might be one of those rare occasions.  What's with the complimenting?  I can't be happier.  So hot.  Sue Bird, you've seen her, right?  Yeah.  You hear the dude?  Oh, God.  And she's so hot.  Does he know how it's killing her?  Yes.  Like, talking about hot chicks in front of her kills you.  That's like being, like, fat, way out of shape. 
[03:10:00]  And girls just talking about this guy that's, like, ripped and stuff.  You don't sit there and go, you know, wow, that is great that he's ripped.  And that you find him attractive.  And I'm a pig.  It's just, she is, it's killing her.  And she goes, no, it's about what's on the inside.  And he goes, no, it's really not.  No, it's not.  Oh, God, that's her.  That's perfect.  Oh, my God.  It's fucking.  It's Oliver Hardy. 
[03:10:30]  Oliver Hardy.  She looks like Oliver Hardy with a perm.  Listen, she tries to defend that.  It's about what's inside.  And has nothing whatsoever to do outside.  Of course.  Of fucking course.  I've said this a million times.  You always go for the physical attraction first.  Especially us.  And then, yes, guys, this is what we do.  You're looking, wow, she's beautiful, she's hot, whatever.  And then you hope that she has something else going on besides the looks.  I'm a fat, funny guy.  Let me tell you something.  No fat, funny bitch is getting anything out of me. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  My girl loves me because I'm fucking funny and all the other bullshit.  But if some guy with a fucking 12-pack comes around, I get mad when she says she wouldn't  fuck him.  I'm going, bitch, you know, do it.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Fucking inside.  You've seen her, right?  Yeah, but it's what's inside that counts with her.  All right?  Not really.  Whatever.  Yeah, it is.  If she's hot, that helps.  Oh.  But it's cool.  It's encouraging.  Hey, Terry, why don't we talk about what's inside you? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, is that a whole?  A lot of calories.  That is such the whole, the complete with the, oh, no, it's what's inside.  She said, encourageable.  Encourageable.  Encourageable.  That word should be taken away from us.  You shouldn't be allowed to use that word.  Along with inappropriate.  Encourageable.  They are encourageable, though.  Steve talks about getting engaged and proves he is an emasculated nobody.  Yes.  All right.  I was well into my 30s, a little older than you, and I was ready to just be a bachelor 
[03:12:00]  all my life, and I had this beautiful woman who was at my side all the time.  One day, I was still living in Boston.  She rings, and I lived in the second floor.  She rings the doorbell.  I let her in.  She knocks on the door.  What's the deal?  I got a life to leave.  You're going to marry me or what?  And you're sitting there with Vinny.  I was here with my best buddy.  We're eating Chinese food and drinking beer, and I said, well, okay, I'll get married.  So, you know, not traditional, to say the least.  All right.  I said yes, by the way. 
[03:12:30]  Congratulations.  With all the laughing she does, you would think she would be thinner.  You'd think she would be burning up calories with all that fake laughter she does.  It's a jolly laugh that she has.  Wow.  No, she...  Oh, okay.  Wow, that is demonic.  And it's everything.  It's like she could do something with the hair, maybe.  Maybe she could put on some makeup.  I don't know.  There's just something that could be done there that isn't being done.  Contacts.  Yes.  Contacts.  Contacts to lose the glasses. 
[03:13:00]  Throw out the hair a little bit.  I'm going to tell you, she is hopeless in terms of fixing.  Like, she can never come back as...  No.  It's like Rosie O'Donnell where nothing she could do.  Like, there's no pretty something in there.  No, no.  Rosie just decided to go full dyke.  But I'm just...  It's like, even if...  Like, losing weight...  Like, she would have to have a complete reconstruction.  Like, her face has to be changed.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  It's just her entire everything.  Like, her head is almost like it's growing outside of her chest as opposed to on her neck  because it's going down.  It's so weird.  You ever see the dark crystal?  The giant birds where...  Like, it's almost vulture-like.  It's something you don't see the vulture neck.  She got my vulture head.  It's almost the head comes down like a Muppet vulture.  Yeah.  But it's like, even if she lost...  There's some people that just have been cursed with not prettiness. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, God.  There she is with a horse.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because I don't want to lose this line.  The comments are ridiculous.  This is why we have the greatest listeners in radio.  Jay from Florida.  How did we miss this one?  This must be a country station because this woman could never do a morning show on Light  FM.  Oh, shit.  Look at this.  Oh, look at her body.  Holy shit.  That's a full body shot.  Look at her fucking...  I think I once wore her body to wrestle in a bar once. 
[03:14:30]  Wow.  Okay.  Is she retarded?  She looks retarded.  Look at the horse who's looking at her like, you fucking slob.  Oh, poor lady.  The horse hates her.  Dude, her boobs are not even close to being...  She's shaped like a croissant.  She is...  That is...  She's shaped just like Big A.  Oh, man.  She's shaped like a pear.  You just feel bad for a woman that...  Because it's just... 
[03:15:00]  There's nothing there.  Because weight loss, it would be strictly for her health.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it wouldn't be, I'm going to lose weight to be hot.  That wouldn't help her out.  It's just strictly to live longer.  You know what?  Patrice is right.  Her arms look too short.  Her waist has got to be close to a 60.  She's a mess.  Her breasts are maybe a 30...  Like a 30...  A 40 A.  She's a 24, 48, 72.  Fuck.  She's got like a steroid shin.  It is a complete pear.  She's shaped like a pear. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, poor thing.  With two big fat legs.  How do you get those pants?  Like, where does she buy her pants?  Man, that's poor woman.  And that's a young picture of her.  So she's been living that...  Oh, I'm sure you could get high school pictures she's still the same.  I mean, that's a young picture of her.  That has to be 20 years younger than that picture that has been up.  Drama club.  She's probably in and all those things.  Oh, no.  Donkey lips.  How many?  Oh, that kid.  Donkey lips.  Everybody's looking at that now?  Donkey lips.  Donkey lips from Salute Your Shorts. 
[03:16:00]  Salute Your Shorts.  An old Nickelodeon show.  What the fuck?  God damn, man.  Patrice is right, though.  There is nothing she could do to make herself feel a little bit better.  Like, weight loss is not going to make it better.  Like, some people, you just go, oh, shit, if she lost weight, she'd be hot.  I'm trying to think of a fat woman who'd be hot if she was not fat.  And I'm, like, on TV, but I can't think of it right now.  Because I say Rosie because I look at her going, eh, man. 
[03:16:30]  Like, Oprah, Oprah could be hot.  Like, not hot, but she would look better.  She knows how to present herself.  Right.  She'd be sexier.  This woman has never had the feeling of someone being attracted to her.  Right.  Never.  She does not know what that means.  She doesn't know what it feels like to have somebody want to fuck her.  Yeah.  Which is nature.  I want to.  Which is, like, I want to fuck you.  And you know what, she would fuck you if you came out of it like that.  Oh, yeah.  Because she has no defense system against somebody just going, I want to fucking fuck you right 
[03:17:00]  now.  I want to bend you over this fucking table and fuck this shit out, you Terry.  She'd probably shake and cum just from hearing that.  And just emphasize the T in Terry.  Just Terry.  And spell her name T-E-R-R-Y.  You fat bitch.  I just want to fucking feed her pizza while you're fucking her from behind.  You can confuse this one real quickly.  If you run in and you just, like, say this table and you just, you just, you just slide 
[03:17:30]  her fucking, her soundboard off the thing.  Like, you can hear it crash.  Yeah.  And she would do one of these things.  Oh.  Oh.  And you just rub her crotch through her pants.  Oh, my God.  She'd fucking pass out.  She would come in a second.  There would be nothing she can do to defend sexual, like a real sexual advance, a hardcore,  like beautiful women ought to defend that shit all the time.  Like, hey, hey, bitch, I want to fuck you.  Yeah.  Get out of my face.  Because you, you just go, Terry. 
[03:18:00]  Hey, Terry.  Yeah.  Terry.  Terry.  And she goes, yeah, you know what I'm fucking talking about.  What do you mean?  And she gets that, oh, my God, because she wants to be like every other woman.  So, she's juggling in her head.  Do I say rape?  Yeah.  Or do I just fuck him?  What am I going to do here?  I don't want to be a whore.  Wait a minute.  Some dick is coming my way?  You fat fuck.  Yeah.  And just call it that.  You choke her.  You find her neck, right?  Oh.  You just lift her.  You find her neck.  And you grab her by the base of her neck, right? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  And you just push a little bit on the neck.  And you just start to shake her face.  And her jaws move.  And just her jaws are moving.  And then you just kiss her.  Oh, that big fucking pelican head.  Can I jump in?  She's the type of woman that would have to do horrific things to be in the sex game.  Oh, man.  Are you talking about?  Oh, wow.  Beyond.  Balls deep.  Like, just.  To the balls and then lick the balls while she's gagging.  Lick the balls as she's gagging. 
[03:19:00]  Like, she's like, fuck, I know he's a serial killer and he's killed 20, but this is all,  you know, I have to play it.  She'd have to pull some shit where it's like, look, stab me.  And fuck the stab hole.  Right.  That would.  She'd have to get some outrageous shit.  And she looks like she would marry a fucking serial killer.  Yeah.  Like, she sends letters to the Green River Killer.  And just.  And she's just there.  Hoping for attention from a serial killer.  Just holding.  She's like, she's got married in a prison.  She's fat with flowers.  Richard Ramirez letters in prison.  Oh, she's definitely got a pen pal in the joint. 
[03:19:30]  And the prison chaplain is, like, fucking standing and marrying her as some guy with  a mullet who's in forever.  Peter Griffin's up there now.  Peter Griffin!  Hi, it's Peter Griffin.  That's who it is.  Hi, it's Peter Griffin.  It's Peter Griffin.  Hi, fuck.  Hi, you're fat.  Hi, your Peter Griffin face.  Oh, Jesus fucking God.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  How does that feel, fatty?  That's her.  She's fucking Peter Griffin.  I wonder, I'm gonna hit on her if I ever see her. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Like, if you just tongue swipe her nips.  Imagine fucking spreading that fat ass apart and sticking your tongue up her ass.  Oh, but imagine if you did it.  She would shake.  If you did it with no, like, regards.  Like, you did it like you want to.  Yeah.  Like, you just fucking take both her meaty ankles.  And you just know what you're doing.  You just push them.  Holy shit.  Like, you know, gently pull.  You just push them apart.  And you just move that little meat like you know what you're doing.  I fucking a few fat girls.  I just know exactly what to do.  And you move that meat. 
[03:20:30]  And you just rub that clearest.  And then you find.  It's just all ready to go.  She'd shake like a truck with a broken timing change.  She'd fucking just rattle herself apart.  And you grab the back of that awful permed up hand.  Drag her around the room.  Pull that shit.  Rip her wig off.  And then she calls you the next day like.  Yeah.  You know what?  Bitch, you're not well.  You know, maybe dinner.  Dinner.  Dinner.  You drag her to the.  Yeah, I mean.  You bring dinner to the beat her with a turkey leg. 
[03:21:00]  You just.  She's so desperate for romance, he would drag her to the truck stop.  And that's what she wants.  And they could blow everybody.  That's what she wants.  Blowing the truck.  That's all retarded women.  A man like that would never think romance.  He's thinking, buy a hooker.  She's thinking romance.  She thinks there's a guy out there.  Because we're not dumb like that.  She thinks there's a guy out there that'll love her for her.  Yeah.  Really, bitch?  Bitch, what can you do to make me love past that awful meaty head?  Just.  My girl's gorgeous. 
[03:21:30]  I have trouble kissing her just because I've seen her for seven years.  So I'm like trying to kiss her.  And she's gorgeous.  But this mess.  After a month of looking at you with love.  You just want to punch her right where.  Just right where there's no nerves.  I hate to spoil the party here, but the next track, she's married?  She's married, all right.  Oh, no.  Find her husband.  She's married.  Is there any way we can find her husband on the website?  No fucking way.  I don't know.  She's got a blog. 
[03:22:00]  Let's find this out here.  The blob.  More of the Bean Morning Coffee Club up there in Rochester, New York.  I'm sure yours was just the typical beautiful moment.  Well, it was for us, of course.  We were at the Loose Caboose.  The Loose Caboose, all right.  The Loose Caboose.  The Loose Caboose.  That's what happens after you eat fucking Mexican and drink too much.  You get a Loose Caboose in the morning. 
[03:22:30]  So she was at the Loose Caboose?  Yeah.  Is that where her wedding was?  Booze.  It was a restaurant in Webster.  It was a restaurant in Webster.  Of course it was.  Train-themed.  Okay, you weren't watching a movie.  What, did she marry a train?  What?  Loose Caboose.  I got it.  Loose Caboose in Webster.  Yuck.  It's a restaurant in Webster.  Of course it's a restaurant.  Train-themed.  You can't be away from a food.  You weren't watching a movie.  No.  Was that the one with Uncle Joe in it? 
[03:23:00]  No.  And he wasn't moving kind of slow either.  Oh, you're so rude.  The Loose Caboose.  It was a wonderful little restaurant.  I'm sure many people remember it.  Anyway.  No, because...  Anyway.  Anyway.  She's married.  Some guy has to say, and this is my wife.  Holy fuck.  Some guy has to go out and go, and this is my wife.  The only point, half the reason that women exist is to be an object.  Right?  Can you imagine if your wife was just all love? 
[03:23:30]  Like, it had to be entirely love.  Right.  Like, half of my girl's point is that I flash her around.  Some other guy wants to fuck her badly.  Like, really badly.  Like, my bitch.  Like, you walk down the street, and guys want to fuck your bitch.  And you're like, yes!  You want to fuck her.  And I don't want to even look at her.  And you want her badly.  You'd give me your wife to fuck my wife.  This guy has no bargaining chip. 
[03:24:00]  It's 100%.  And his life, it's all love.  Love.  Can you imagine your whole existence is based on, I love you?  I love my wife?  That's your...  You have to love her to get on top of her, and just...  Your dick has to get hard.  Your dick has to get hard.  Maybe she was volunteering at the blind camp, like in Mask.  You have to risk having a heart attack with the Viagra.  Like, you risk Viagra for a bad bitch. 
[03:24:30]  If your dick wasn't working quite well, you go, damn, this bitch is bad.  I got to keep her happy, and she's going to fuck other men.  But you don't even have a bargaining chip if you want to go swing.  Like, if you have your woman...  Oh, God, you bring that?  ...to trade for his woman...  You're getting someone's dog.  She's tradable with someone's fucking pet.  You just want to kick her right in the pussy, like you just want to...  All of a sudden, all right, you can fuck the chick that I brought,  but I'm just going to kick her in her pussy the entire time you're fucking the girl I brought. 
[03:25:00]  Look, you see my girl?  Treat her the way you think a woman should be treated.  Do me a favor.  I'll fuck with your woman, but I want to stomp all over this pig.  I want her to snort.  I want her to do piggy things.  Like, the only...  You just want to leash her?  Yeah, just walk her around.  She was also voted Mother of the Year.  Oh, fuck.  She has a kid?  She has a kid that gave a great speech.  Jesus.  There's a video of the kid giving a speech.  Oh, see, that's terrible. 
[03:25:30]  That's terrible.  Let's move on.  Terry continues her story about the caboose thing.  Yeah.  And the guys continue their brand of humor.  We were there and having a lovely dinner, and there was something...  Chicken wings?  No.  Caesar salad wrap?  It might have been chicken, though.  I generally ordered...  An ostrich.  No.  Something trophy.  Just a trophy.  You know, it was just a huge portion.  Just one of those giant meatballs.  Like, not even little ones.  Like, I enjoy little meatballs in my spaghetti. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  But just a giant...  One giant meatball that was rolled up with onions in it.  She calls meatloaf meatballs.  Yeah.  Meatballs.  Meatloaf.  Just spaghetti and meatloaf.  One of those Renaissance fair turkey legs.  Yeah, turkey leg, like fucking Henry VIII, who was prettier than she is.  Look at that fucking retard bang haircut she's got.  She's getting into a cop car. 
[03:26:30]  Well, because she's fine.  They're arresting her for upsetting the fucking gravitational pull of the planet.  Oh, this poor lady.  Come on, man.  You know how they arrest you.  Damn it.  It's all fun.  Oh, boy, she's laughing.  It's for charity.  Oh, I hope someone bails me out.  Wow, what a mess.  I generally ordered...  No.  All right, wait a minute.  We'll start over here.  We missed a good joke.  All right.  We were there and having a lovely dinner, and there was a...  Chicken wings?  No.  Caesar salad wrap?  It might have been chicken, though.  I generally ordered... 
[03:27:00]  No.  Tilapia crusted in there.  All right, that's enough.  Whatever that is.  You can't get the ribs.  I want your fingers to be cleaned.  You want to hear about it, or don't ya?  Yes.  Or I'll sit on ya.  Yeah, you want to hear about it, or don't ya?  Don't ya.  She isn't...  She's too fucking gruesome to have that attitude.  Like, hey, settle down.  Like, shut up, Ernest Bordnine.  Ernest Bordnine? 
[03:27:30]  She's too fat to be sassy.  Ernest Bordnine?  Yeah, much too fat to be sassy.  That fucking hair looks like a divot.  It looks like someone fucking swung too deep, made a divot, and someone picked up the divot  off the golf course and put it on her head.  Look, this will make you look better.  It spray-painted it brown.  Here is your divot hair.  Her chin is wider than the top of her head.  Yeah!  She's got, like, Zippy the Pinheads look going. 
[03:28:00]  What a gruesome, gruesome person.  Her hair looks like one of those old leather football helmets that they stand in.  Jesus Christ.  Like an old Indy car race helmet.  One of those.  The old four-horseman head.  Oh, is she awful.  Every new picture is more gruesome than the last.  Oh, new rock me head.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes,  Who took those photos of Terry?  Google Earth?  She has, like, I couldn't even picture doing anything.  There it is.  The old leather foot. 
[03:28:30]  There's her hair.  Terry wig.  There's an old Notre Dame leather football helmet.  You know, Sergeant G brings up a good line on his feedback from Iraqi, right?  So, are they making fat jokes?  They may have just turned me a little bit.  They're making fun of her fatness, Sam.  But they don't dare make fun of her ugliness.  Yeah, I don't know what they're doing.  All right, she finishes the story, finally, of when she got engaged.  There was a piano player there, and he was...  So he started playing her.  Yeah.  Nice, Sam. 
[03:29:00]  Sam can't get the leather helmet on, because it's his big fucking afro.  Fucking cool, man.  Is that a real replica?  Yeah, it's a real replica.  That's cool as shit.  How do you play football in that fucking thing?  Imagine going out in the field now.  Those were tough motherfuckers, man.  Running in fast motion on film.  But they couldn't figure out something better than the leather helmet?  What the fuck?  Well, because you really wasn't...  You know what?  A real tackle has nothing to do with your head.  Yeah.  Because guys play rugby with nothing.  Yeah.  So, ultimately, you're not supposed to, you know...  They didn't have, like...  That's cool, though.  Space-age polymers. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  They had to fucking wait for that shit.  Here's something called plastic.  Son of a bitch, man.  I feel bad that woman is such a victim.  Oh, is she?  Penn Jillette, they're saying, too.  She looks like a little fat Penn.  All right, you want to hear the end of the engagement story?  Oh, please.  Or what?  Or what?  Or what?  All right.  There was a piano player there, and he was...  Boone went over and asked him to play my favorite song from The Wizard of Oz.  Oh, my darling Clemens.  It's a small one.  No.  Ding-dong, the witch is dead. 
[03:30:00]  The scene where she landed on the witch?  We're laughing our balls off as the Dow's down 500 points now.  Holy shit.  Below 10,000 for the first time in four years.  Yeah.  98, 30.  Yeah.  Down to 495.  Told you, Andrew.  It's a small one.  No.  It's no.  Ding-dong, the witch is dead.  God, I can't remember the name.  Over the Rainbow.  Oh.  All right.  Over the Rainbow.  Somewhere over the rainbow.  And he... 
[03:30:30]  As soon as the song started, I went, oh, my gosh.  And he got down on one knee in front of the restaurant, and he asked me to marry him.  It was wonderful.  Oh.  It was wonderful.  Wake up, you sleepyhead.  All right, it's now my favorite song.  The Wicked Witch is dead.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, now.  The Wicked Witch is dead.  Got down on one knee, had a look at those big fucking thighs.  Imagine trying to see her head.  Oh, God. 
[03:31:00]  Where'd you go?  Oh.  He took that fucking barrel ring and put it on her finger.  And she can't even see her own vagina, so she probably shaves it like old guys shave  their beard where there's...  She ain't shaving shit.  There's still patches.  She doesn't see it.  Why shave it?  You know that's just a wreck down there.  Let's say hi to Sean in Rochester.  Sean, the home of Brother Weez, of course.  What do you got, Sean?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I've met her daughter. 
[03:31:30]  Uh-huh.  Like at some park event where the radio went down and did her thing.  Uh-huh.  And her daughter's smoking hot.  Dude, I'll tell you something.  I went out with a girl.  My brother went out with one of her sisters.  Friends of mine went out.  It was like a family of just these fucking girls.  And the mother was atrocious.  Fucking slob.  And just...  She kind of looked like her.  Like Terry.  Uh-huh.  And the daughter's smoking hot. 
[03:32:00]  How does that happen?  All skinny fucking blondes.  Just really hot.  And the mother was a disaster.  She couldn't fucking move.  She sat in this one chair and just stunk the whole room up like B.O.  Because she couldn't fucking wash or something.  So...  And I would come in.  I was working at Dan's Bakery at the time.  Yeah.  Making bread.  So I would always make sure to get a bunch of bread when I was going over there.  And then I would just give it to her.  And she'd be like, oh, thank you. 
[03:32:30]  Some Italian bread.  It's like, yeah, it's Italian bread.  Right.  I'm going to go ravage one of your fucking daughters.  But she was a big...  You're like...  Slob.  Smoking hot how though?  Tell her...  Tell her a little more detail.  What's smoking hot?  What's she looking like?  Yeah.  She's like, uh...  Probably like, you know, 5'7".  She's got a nice rack.  Dark hair.  Like, uh...  Like hazel green eyes.  Yeah, it's definitely possible.  She couldn't leave with her daughter.  But, you know, that's...  That's how we roll in Rochester.  You ever walk around...  I'm ugly with pretty good-looking kids.  And then all the kids leave. 
[03:33:00]  There you go.  Cool.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Jock-tober is still a hit there, Sam.  Jock-tober.  It's the B-Morning Coffee Club, huh?  Yeah, it's the B-Morning Coffee Club.  We barely listened to the audio.  We couldn't get past the fucking publicity shot.  I love Jock-tober.  Yeah.  What are you working on for tomorrow?  Uh, I'd really like to find something in Boston.  Mm-hmm.  We just spent so much time just bashing the hell out of that woman. 
[03:33:30]  Well, you have to.  I know.  That's the best part of Jock-tober, just attacking people.  I didn't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  For no reason.  But you have to.  That's why Sam loves it so much.  That's how he lives his life.  Why else is she walking around the earth?  Just to be attacked.  Right.  Yeah.  She can't possibly be doing any good out there.  No.  Oh, my God.  552 points down.  Oh, it's pushing...  Oh, boy.  Oh, this is really, really going to be bad.  They're saying it's the whole world. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  So, if it's the whole world economy, can't we all just get together and go, all right,  this is our new economy.  Do you even know economy at all?  Like, why can't the world just go, you know what?  We're all rich.  Right.  We all live in a place and we all eat.  Yeah.  I don't understand why the world doesn't come together.  How can the world decide we're finished?  Yeah.  Like, we're done.  Who's policing the world?  Just get together and go, all right, look, we got issues.  Let's all make believe the issues are no more.  There you go. 
[03:34:30]  Dude, this is all bullshit.  Just decide.  Ready?  You know what?  Instead of gold, it's crumb cake crumbs are our basis for money.  Like, I've never understood what the fuck that means.  You just decided gold?  How about dirt?  Yeah.  Like, what the fuck are you talking about?  How about aluminum?  Aluminum be nice.  You know what?  I don't even understand that shit.  How can the world economy crash?  What does that mean?  It is Pot Talk Monday. 
[03:35:00]  So let's say dirt becomes the currency.  What happens to the earth?  Oh, my God.  You just start digging it up.  Well, we're...  But not the currency, but the...  We're such awful humans.  We wouldn't even acknowledge that.  We're just, you know, destroying the land.  We would just take every possible piece of dirt we could.  Until there's no earth left.  No dirt left.  Right.  Or it would be left, of course.  But it would be in big piles that you can't do anything with.  This is all bullshit.  This is, I think, a bunch of, you know, high rollers that run the market, figuring out ways 
[03:35:30]  to make a lot of money.  Because there's no real panic here.  I mean, this isn't the average Joe panic selling.  The average Joe already sold his shit or is hunkering down.  This isn't somebody like, oh, my God, sell...  These are motherfuckers that are driving this market down 500 fucking points, and tomorrow  this fucking market's going to go up.  And whoever is buying right now will sell that shit off tomorrow and make money. 
[03:36:00]  Everybody who's suffered already did.  Anybody who's going to get fired got fired already.  I'm buying something today.  Buy.  I don't know why.  I'm buying fucking...  I'm buying something today.  In my humble opinion, I'm just going to buy something.  What do you want?  I'll buy you a couple of shirts.  Buy it on E-Trade right now.  Some suits.  Some suit jackets.  No, I got to ask...  I got some people that I could go to.  Legit.  And I'm going to buy something today.  I want a Diamond Raymond Wild Watch. 
[03:36:30]  That's what I like.  Go mug somebody.  Motherfucker.  And that is the one I'm buying.  Those are the options I'm fucking getting into today.  You're going to go with Apple?  Perhaps.  I'm just asking.  I see Apple up on CNN.  Here's what you do.  Here's what somebody told me.  As long as we have a universe, as long as this thing's being invented, you know who's going  to always win?  Someone who fixes shit.  So if you invest on people who fix the upcoming shit... 
[03:37:00]  You know what you sound like right now?  You sound like someone's dad sitting the kid down for a talk because he's a shitty repairman  and the son wants to know.  You know, son, repairing things is very important.  What do you invest?  I do important things.  Invest in a big company that is going to fix the next big thing.  I build things.  Do you know how important that is?  iPod fixing technology.  iPod fixing technology.  iPod fixing.  It's called going to the Apple store and saying this fucking thing doesn't work and they give 
[03:37:30]  you a new one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, they're not about fixing that fucking thing.  They're not even a screw to open it up.  That's why I don't...  That's why I...  They come up with a new one every six months.  They don't want you to fix the iPod.  If you can go back in time, find one screw that opens that fucking thing.  If you can go back in time, what would you have invested in?  Oh, fuck.  Let's say 20 years ago.  No, what?  It was 20 years ago?  Yeah.  Fucking Apple.  Apple.  Apple.  Of course. 
[03:38:00]  Would be good.  Microsoft, any of the computer technology.  Even back then, Yahoo.  And then wait until the bubble and then sell.  Let me tell you something.  Of course, if you're going to do that, I would just get the Sports Almanac from 1955.  I would take all the names.  I would take the web names.  And then go back in time.  You don't need to use the market.  No, no.  I would take web names, man.  Biff Tannen made a fortune.  Listen, I've been to the Biff Tannen Museum. 
[03:38:30]  You went?  Yeah.  And he made a fortune, apparently, with the Sports Almanac.  Just came off looking like a lucky guy.  He had made enough money that he had like a robot of himself in front of his house.  Yes, in front of his house.  And then the courthouse building a giant hotel, a casino, a hotel over it.  Amazing what he did just with the Sports Almanac.  Yeah, no market.  It was just all the, you know, OTB and stuff like that.  Yeah, yeah.  How about Viagra?  Biff Tannen, very smart man.  Yeah.  That didn't do shit. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, yes, Patrice, yes.  How about Viagra?  Invest in Viagra?  Who puts that out?  I don't know.  Pharmaceutical.  Pfizer?  Yeah, Pfizer's a good pharmaceutical company.  That would have been good 20 years ago, maybe.  Sure.  All right.  Let's, uh...  We can maybe do one more thing and get out of here.  That was terrific, though, Sam.  Yeah.  Well, the Hillman's always a go-to show in Boston as far as hackery goes.  Let's do Hillman, then.  Or Matt Siegel.  I think he's on Kiss. 
[03:39:30]  Can I take off my Terry wig?  Yeah.  Terry Clifford.  She was having fun with her fatness in there somewhere.  You know she's crying inside, though.  Who are we kidding?  Of course she is.  All right.  Wants to argue with Ant about what?  All right.  About what?  Let's see what this is about.  Argue with Ant about websites and stocks?  No.  What?  No.  What?  No. 
[03:40:00]  What?  What?  All right.  A story we didn't get to last week that we wanted to was the JetBlue thing.  JetBlue attendant...  Patrice, I'm going to ask you.  One more thing we can do.  JetBlue attendant showed nude pics to passenger.  All right.  Okay.  Was it a male attendant?  Oh, okay.  Oh, no.  Ooh, boo, boo, boo.  I think it was...  That's queer.  I think it was a black dude.  A black male? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  A black male attendant showed...  Shit is out.  Trying to pick up some chick on the plane.  That's unusual, because usually all those guys are sissies.  I've never met a straight male stewardess ever.  I hear you.  All right.  Let's do this.  New Jersey woman's trip home from visiting family turned into a terrifying encounter in  the sky.  Yeah, she says it all started shortly after she boarded a JetBlue flight, and she says  she has yet to recover.  Oh, can I please stop?  Gina Rousset is still traumatized. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, boy.  Eight months after she says...  Eight months and she's crying over some cock?  You know what?  Frivolous lawsuit.  This is bullshit.  Bullshit.  Traumatized.  Eight months after she says a JetBlue flight from Fort Lauderdale to Newark turned into a  nightmare.  It started with what she thought was a friendly conversation with a flight attendant.  But looking back now, she says she should have been wary.  He literally told me that he was going to have nobody sit next to me because I was all his. 
[03:41:30]  I was definitely trapped.  And after takeoff, it got much worse.  She says Dana Rokium's behavior was lewd and outrageous.  He kept telling me that he wanted me.  And at one point, he said that, you know, you want me.  And always grabbing himself, you know, you know, like profusively.  I mean, all the time.  Profusively?  Profusively.  Even if she was using the right word, it was wrong.  Profusely would not fit there either. 
[03:42:00]  It was not the word she wanted, you dumb bitch.  Grabbing profusively.  This woman.  He sweats profusely.  Yeah.  You know, maybe if he said, she said, he's shitting on me profusely.  Profusely.  You would have to be touching.  Say he was touching himself and he came on me profusely.  Right.  Yeah.  But not just touching himself profusely.  Dummy.  And she says twice he tossed his cell phone showing naked pictures of him onto her tray  table.  All right.  You know, once, you know, but you're, you're, you're catching the cell phone a second time. 
[03:42:30]  I mean, you know.  After a while, you knock on the pilot's door and you're just like, excuse me, sir.  Right.  Can you land in Oklahoma City?  This guy's trying to rape me on your plane.  Right.  Get the fuck out of here.  I mean, you might fall for the cell phone trick once, but twice.  I always laugh at that.  What do you think?  This time he's going to show you some cute picture of a panda?  Yeah.  She was fucking drunk and she was hitting on him.  Of course.  Watching that awful JetBlue television.  A table.  I told him, you know, you're disgusting. 
[03:43:00]  You know, you know, I'm married and I don't want any part of you.  I kept telling him that.  That's what I don't understand.  Probably with a big smile on her face and, you know.  I'm going.  Frantic, she escaped to the bathroom.  Rousset says he followed, making vulgar comments through the door.  On her way back to her seat, she says, Arochium grabbed her buttocks.  But incredibly, she did nothing and told no one.  Incredibly.  I was, like, really scared.  Why I didn't, like, get up and say something to somebody, I don't know. 
[03:43:30]  Seven months later, Arochium was arrested on charges of obscene and indecent exposure.  Oh, you cunt.  For making a lewd, obscene, and indecent sexual proposal.  This should be a fucking...  According to charging documents, he admitted to showing the full-body naked picture on his cell phone and to making sexual advances.  But he denied grabbing Rousset or acting in a harassing manner.  This should be a one-day fucking statute for a woman to say somebody fucking scared her sexually. 
[03:44:00]  Seven months ago?  Maybe a two-hour limit.  Yeah.  A two-hour limit.  Two hours?  Two hours.  After I supposedly scared you with my dick, I should be arrested.  Right.  Two hours and ten minutes is too late, tops.  You fucking bitch.  Seven months later, she decides she can make some money.  Are you fucking serious?  You haven't to the plane lands.  A bitch has eight months to say you're a dick scared her?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  How about eight years?  How about after me and my bitch break up, she can say she was horrified the whole time? 
[03:44:30]  Bitch.  And then finally.  In a statement to CBS2, JetBlue says Arochium no longer works for the airline and that JetBlue  has and will continue to cooperate in the investigation.  Rousset wishes she had spoken up on the plane and hopes by coming forward, other women will  learn from her.  I don't think I'll ever get over it.  Yeah, you'll get over it.  I think it'll always be there.  You got over it.  You're over it.  Fucking cunt.  Bob and PA, what was everyone else on the plane doing? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, as you said goodbye to everybody, first of all, JetBlue planes are no bigger than  my hat.  So if you're raping somebody, boy, someone sees it.  Yep.  At least in seat eight.  Yeah.  In row eight, seat B saw the fucking potential raping and it's like at the end of the plane,  hey, everybody, thank you.  Thank you for coming.  Thank you for being on the flight.  Thank you for being on the flight.  And then she gets there.  Yeah, you hot bitch.  Did you like my dick?  Yeah.  And rubs her ass and says, good luck to you. 
[03:45:30]  And then seven months later, she comes back.  Seven months.  She'd never seen a dick picture that it upset her so much with.  This guy, you know, she was just sitting there going, ooh, that's all you?  She's like, oh, and you know, it sounded like, stop it.  You know, I'm married.  I'll tell you what happened.  Oh.  I'll tell you what happened.  She got it.  I'll tell you exactly what the fuck happened.  She got a number.  She went through with this.  Got the number.  She's married, right?  She started having a little affair with this motherfucker. 
[03:46:00]  Either he dumped her off and said, look, bitch, I met this better looking bitch in Paris and go fuck yourself.  Or her husband found out and he became the nigger rapist.  But wouldn't the guy say right off the bat, hey, I've been banging this broad.  You didn't hear his side of the story.  All you heard was this bitch.  He got fired and he admitted to showing pictures.  But he could have been admitting to showing pictures.  Like, yeah, I showed a bitch pictures.  She wanted to see him.  They didn't get particulars on his side of the story. 
[03:46:30]  Nah.  I'm giving you his side of the story.  And that's not a good case on his part.  You know what I mean?  Well, in terms of losing his job, he's going to lose his job.  To say, yeah, I showed her the pictures because she really wanted to see it.  He would be fucked if he said that.  Well, he's fucked anyway.  But he's saying the truth.  It's almost like, okay, you married, right?  You're cheating.  You get in some trouble.  You say, look, man, yeah, I did eat a pussy.  But she's saying you raped her. 
[03:47:00]  So you got to say, yeah, I did eat a pussy because this is some bigger news.  This bitch is saying she was harassed and he got arrested.  So he's saying, yeah, I showed her my dick.  I lose my job and I don't want to go to jail.  Fucking bitch.  And that's that.  Son of a bitch.  And that's that.  Why is it that?  Get this bitch's number.  Why do these ladies be?  We should try to get her on the phone.  Talk to these people, man.  Why don't we?  Sorry, I'm in court.  Really?  You want to do the line of the day and get the hell out of here?  Let's do it.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:47:30]  Did you unplug your box?  Did you unplug your box?  Mm-hmm.  That was really funny.  Line of the day brought to you by, I think, WebEx, right?  Webex.com.  Hold meetings, make presentations, do it from the comfort of your own home or office.  Check it out at Webex.com.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Got to take the shoes off.  I take the motherfucking shoes off.  I hate taking the shoes off.  By the way, the fastest way to get to the airport is to come dressed just like an Arab. 
[03:48:00]  Holy shit.  Sandals and a big shirt.  No belt.  No belt.  No shoes.  Nothing.  Wow, that's fucking perfect.  Wow.  Yeah, that's wonderful, Patrice.  Patrice is going to be at the Addison Improv for the Dallas folk.  Yeah.  It's the Dallas market.  It's just one of the suburbs.  I've been to that club.  They do a good job there.  I'm going to the suburbs of Texas.  They all carry guns. 
[03:48:30]  Can't wait.  They all carry and they all got boob jobs down in Dallas.  That's great.  Fantastic.  It is like another world down there.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Is it like one of those small boats from Apocalypse Now?  No, it's kind of a tricked out like pleasure craft that I, you know, A-teamed up.  Like a long Miami speedboat.  Like I A-teamed with some metal and, you know, some technology and some guns and stuff.  You're a wimp.  And then why?  Because you know they can't swim.  Well, that's why I'm in the water. 
[03:49:00]  So, that was quite a racist discussion.  Oh, Jesus.  Back and forth, daydreaming about what you're going to do.  Me and Patrice, we leave the show and just start daydreaming.  Ah, waxing fantastic about what could be.  Oh, damn.  To the jackasses who think we're supposed to be here until noon, go fuck yourself.  Shut your fuckholes. 
[03:49:30]  Especially Jim Akers or Akers from Louisville.  We're supposed to do this until 11 every day and a lot of days we go way past 11, so go fuck yourself.  I guess the website says we're on until noon.  That has nothing to do with us.  Shut up.  Thank you, man.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Boo again.  What is this, a wrestling match?  What's going on?  Hiss, hiss, boo, hiss.  It's like Snidely Whiplash is going to come out and tire her to the train tracks. 
[03:50:00]  And McCain's got to rescue her.  I'll rescue you.  Yay!  Oh, here comes Obama.  Nuh-uh-uh.  Boo, hiss, boo.  Nuh-uh-uh.  Oh, man.  You are the only funny.  Great impressionist I've ever met.  Hey, Patrice?  I'm telling you, man.  I've met impressionists.  I know what you're saying.  That is a compliment. 
[03:50:30]  They're just not funny people.  They got the voice down, but if you listen, they have nothing.  Anthony, he does spot-on impressions.  And he's a funny motherfucker, man.  I'm getting the vapors over here.  I'm serious, man.  I like to just pull a Snidely Whiplash impression.  I would have to think about that for seven seconds.  At least seven minutes before I can remember Snidely Whiplash.  But to actually pull it out, you know, you remind, you're like, you're Jim Carrey from Cable 
[03:51:00]  Guy.  Something happened.  He's a prodigy to be able to pull shit up like that.  I was going to say, you know how lonely he has to be to have all that inside his head?  That's all it was.  You know how much time you've got to be sitting in front of a TV by yourself?  It's almost rain, man, to be able to do that.  Years.  To be able to pull a whole Snidely Whiplash, all the characters.  Man, then I can't remember shit that people tell me, like, you know, oh, we're doing this  next week, and I'm like, wow, it's just a strange thing, man, how you able to do that  shit.  And then spot-on impressions.  Like, absolutely spot-on impressions, man. 
[03:51:30]  That shit's funny, man.  Thank you, sir.  But then some of these guys, though, that do impressions, you just go, hey, man.  No, if I'm not doing an impression, please don't talk to me.  Please.  I have nothing.  Nothing.  I really don't have anything.  You don't need me to do something?  Especially my regular voice.  I have nothing.  I know everybody's got a name floating in their head.  You know, he's a nice guy, though.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  I do believe the last one.  Four syllables. 
[03:52:00]  You know what it is, though?  I'll tell you something, and I'll play the white devil's advocate here.  Which is redundant.  Go ahead.  Nice.  I see nice.  Line of the day time.  Thanks to WebEx.com.  Patrice, thank you.  Patrice will be here tomorrow?  The whole show.  Jim is gone.  Oh, fuck.  I'm sleeping in tomorrow.  Yeah.  I don't have to come in at five and show prep.  Nothing.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:52:30]  Just give us a good energy.  Just talk about it.  We throw the playbook out.  When you come by, we throw the playbook out.  We'll talk about what we fantasize about overnight.  When I went to sleep by with a smile on my face.  People are sticking up for Jay Moore.  Of course Jay Moore could do the voices and be funny at the same time.  Oh, yeah.  I have to say, you know, you generalize.  And there's probably a few.  But I met, like, Roger Cabler.  You know Roger Cabler?  Mm-mm.  He was one of the great impressions.  I mean, great. 
[03:53:00]  But just as a person, you just go, Roger, man.  Come on.  I drove one-on-one time.  It's just nothing.  If he's not doing an impression of somebody, it just ain't happening, man.  Yeah.  But Jay, Jay, funny, a person who does great impressions.  But I never thought Jay to be, he does great, obscure impressions.  Yeah.  And he's a funny dude.  But I never, I guess I'm not around Jay enough to go, oh, he does impressions.  But I know he does a great Christopher Walken.  He's not known for doing impressions.  He's starting to be.  He's going in that direction.  And they are obscure and shit. 
[03:53:30]  What about Fred Travolina?  Okay, that chick right there isn't bad.  Is she black?  She's black.  She's something.  See, that's a black chick that I would definitely find attractive, Patrice.  Remember we had that argument once?  Yeah, yeah.  That type.  I don't want a fat ass.  I don't want fucking, you know, Miss fucking Zimbabwe.  This one here.  Yeah, that chick right there is fucking pretty hot.  She's pretty fucking hot.  She's barely black, though.  She's black acceptable.  She's black acceptable. 
[03:54:00]  And white acceptable.  You fucking coward.  Like I could bring her home?  Yeah, your mama would go, she's lovely.  What is she?  She would go, she almost looks Italian.  She's Sicilian.  Before we go, can I ask one quick question?  Sure.  Nothing's quick to do, though.  Maybe we can think about it and come back tomorrow.  Look at that little tease.  That's nice.  How about for tomorrow?  Okay.  Put the question out.  How come Obama's white side isn't in the equation?  We answer that to, I don't know, but I'm asking tomorrow. 
[03:54:30]  Okay.  We'll think about that one.  All right.  We'll think on that.  That's your homework assignment for this evening.  Oh, we almost got out without homework.  God!  You can't give homework after one of the day starts.  Why doesn't his mama count?  That's all I want to say.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got a few things in my head, but...  I just have to say yes to Redding, Bobby D, and a few other people that are playing along 
[03:55:00]  at home.  Just put it that way.  WebEx.com, thank you.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Stop tasering me.  Stop beating me in the face.  I'm misbehaving.  Stop being loud in movie theaters.  Pull over.  Do I deserve a tasing? 
[03:55:30]  Pull over and give your license and registration.  Stop demanding more dumplings, bitch, from the Chinese ladies serving the food.  More dumplings.  More dumplings.  Oh, yeah.  There's a little improv stand-up for you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the friends, you stop demanding more dumplings, bitch.  Bitch.  Yeah.  Bitch.  Patrice, always a pleasure.  Oh, yeah.  We'll see him and everybody else tomorrow.  Later.  We'll go with the quick out. 
[03:56:00]  Have a good morning.  Bye. </pre>
