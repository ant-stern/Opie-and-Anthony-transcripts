<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show on XM202, hosted by Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton, began with the hosts engaging in self-deprecating humor, calling themselves various offensive names and insulting crew members like Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, and E-Rock.  This devolved into a nonsensical screaming match mimicking a Simpsons episode.  A large portion of the show was dedicated to their "WOW" sticker promotion (Whip Them Out Wednesday), which encouraged listeners to display stickers for a chance to see female nudity. They discussed the promotion's success, particularly in Philadelphia, contrasting it with the lackluster response from other areas, and reminisced about the aged and deteriorated stickers still visible on cars.

The hosts then speculated about the racial background of their former intern, Sam, based on his appearance, making humorous, potentially offensive, comments about his features and family lineage.  This segued into a discussion about inflated claims of ancestry to famous historical figures. Jay Moore's creation of a 30-second radio show segment prompted a listener contest for wacky morning radio show names.  Numerous offensive suggestions like "Rape Kit and Crawl Space" and "Placenta and Friends" were proposed and discussed, often at length. Listener calls included one from an intoxicated caller whose call was cut short and another from Tony, who called to insult the hosts, labeling them as Howard Stern wannabes. This sparked a heated exchange involving insults and boasts about listener numbers and financial success.  More listener-submitted morning show names, including "Skidmark and Dr. Balls" and "Unwanted Pregnancy and Doc Martin or Coat Hanger Show," were discussed.

The hosts played a confusing audio clip submitted by Steve, revealing to be a video of two Czech politicians fighting. This led to discussions about Steve's work habits and his tendency to avoid responsibility.  Another audio clip showcased a police officer butchering the National Anthem at a memorial service.  A significant segment focused on Jimmy Norton's experience with an escort service, where the woman sent didn’t match the online advertisement.  This story prompted further discussion and listener calls. The broadcast concluded with additional listener calls and a clip from "Homeless Radio," featuring Tippy Tom discussing current events and gas prices.

A subsequent segment centered around two main topics: a caller, Rob, detailed his experience with a sex worker agency, receiving a different woman than advertised. He described the woman he received as “nice” while expressing anger towards the agency.  The hosts and Rob humorously discussed the situation. The second topic involved commentary and audio clips of newscasters struggling with unscripted segments; various examples of awkward moments and poor improvisational skills were highlighted.  Interspersed throughout were discussions on "freak show" topics, including a three-armed baby, conjoined twins, and a baby with a parasitic twin head, with the hosts making extensive, potentially offensive jokes.  A listener commented on the incongruity of pro-choice advocates and the amputation of an extra arm from a baby.  The segment concluded with more audio clips of newscasters’ failures and a humorous anti-smoking commercial featuring a man with a hole in his throat.

Another part of the show opened with the hosts riffing on a goose with an arrow in it, followed by mocking a weather report extensively.  A news story about marijuana muffins given to high school students was discussed.  A studio segment featured Otto and George, a ventriloquist act, and the Lizard Man, a heavily tattooed performer.  They discussed the Lizard Man's extensive body modifications and upcoming Jägermeister music tour.  Andy Garcia's alleged past as a conjoined twin and Katie Couric's retirement from the *Today Show* were also discussed.  The Lizard Man then performed a "gastric siphon," inserting a tube into his nose, down into his stomach, and siphoning the contents back out, mixing it with Gatorade.  This was graphically detailed and met with disgust from the hosts and some studio guests.  An outdoor "XM walk-over" segment involved interactions with people on the street, including a homeless man with a noticeably large testicle and a woman with one arm, all discussed with crude humor.  A listener call mentioned an alleged O.J. Simpson death. The broadcast closed with promotions for their website and live shows.

A further segment included discussions about Willie Nelson's hair, celebrity deaths (Steve Misereck, Alex Toth, and Steve McQueen), and a listener-suggested "Big Ball" competition.  Lizard Man performed several self-inflicted stunts, including eating mealworms, inserting a corkscrew through his nose and mouth, and having darts thrown at him.  The Jägermeister Music Tour was promoted, along with complaints about working with rock bands.  Lizard Man introduced "Dr. Griff," who assisted with the stunts, despite lacking medical credentials.  The hosts discussed randomly firing employees for efficiency, food preferences, and the Fat Smash Diet.  Audio clips of Katie Couric's farewell speech from the *Today Show* were played, interspersed with offensive commentary including repeated use of the phrase "goddamn rich cunt."  Clips of Matt Lauer and Al Roker's responses were also played.

Finally, a segment focused on a movie featuring Jeff Goldblum, a woman exposing her breasts on the *Today Show* with "WOW" written on her stomach, and an extensive commentary on a Larry King interview with Elizabeth Taylor about Michael Jackson’s child molestation accusations. Andrew Dice Clay's appearance featured increasingly vulgar and sexually explicit jokes, with Anthony injuring his lip with a bottle, resulting in more crude humor. The hosts promoted Otto and George's comedy shows and archived Opie and Anthony shows on XM radio.  Several listener calls reacted to the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What the fuck?  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  I'm me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rapid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating poop that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock.  Oh, please, going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up. 
[00:01:00]  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  Don't laugh at me!  Let's get the show on the road.  Don't laugh at me!  Stop laughing at me!  You stop laughing at me!  And that's my dinner! 
[00:01:30]  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  You will be molested.  Oh, dear!  Oh, dear!  Oh, my God!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's better.  Ah!  Best Simpsons episode ever.  Ah!  The Screaming Homer.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Silence with the stopper. 
[00:02:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  How obnoxious is that first thing in the morning?  Very.  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony Show.  Hi, everyone.  We're going to stay focused today.  Going to give that one a try, huh?  We're going to try to stay focused today.  Wow.  We actually might talk about things today.  Stop.  We might stay on the subject longer than 20 seconds today.  20 seconds, I think, was long for yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  I think it was like 10.  Although a lot of people liked yesterday's show.  A lot of schizophrenics.  A lot of people that wear tinfoil on their heads before they go to sleep.  You know who I want to say hi to today, Anthony?  Satan.  W-Y-S-P in Philly.  Who are pals down in Philly.  Philly!  They just understand the Opian Anthony Show.  They are motivated.  I do believe we'll be number one in Philly first. 
[00:03:00]  Oh.  How long?  Oh, I challenge all the other cities.  I challenge all the other cities.  But Philly is way ahead of everybody.  I'm willing to give 10, 20 bucks to the first city that makes us number one.  You know what we should do?  Could give a little more than that.  More than that.  We should do a road show.  Yeah.  We should do a road show to the city that makes us number one.  Makes us numero uno, as they say.  Yes, and I think early, early odds, Philly's going to do it. 
[00:03:30]  Philly's going to do it for us.  I got some emails from the fine folks at W-Y-S-P yesterday, including Karen Buck.  She said the excitement down there is ridiculous.  They got their WOW stickers printed.  They got somewhere on the W-Y-S-P website where you just click, send in your self-addressed stamped envelopes.  They've been stuffing envelopes like crazy.  And then I hear other cities that were being broadcast in, they don't even have the WOW stickers made yet.  Oh, jeep. 
[00:04:00]  I know we have them here in New York.  I know they have them in Philly.  And, you know, they can't stuff envelopes fast enough in Philly.  So I want to acknowledge W-Y-S-P for their effort today.  You're not going to throw any cities under the bus for not having representation?  I see one or two.  Yeah.  I see one or two.  We'll hit them behind the scenes first and say, hey, why don't you help us out?  This is what I do.  You know who you are.  You showed them with that tap on the paper. 
[00:04:30]  So hello to Philly and, of course, everybody at W-Y-S-P.  Yes.  And, of course, a hi to the rest of the cities we're broadcasting, too.  Yeah.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yes.  We love WOW.  Absolutely.  WOW stickers.  I'm telling you, in New York, starting to see them everywhere again.  It's kind of cool.  Popping up.  It was quite a while driving around, and you would see a WOW sticker, but you'd realize  maybe the edges were peeling a little bit.  You'd see call letters on there that are long gone. 
[00:05:00]  You know, things like that.  Covered over by soot coming out of exhaust.  It was kind of sad, actually.  Actually?  You know, because...  It was sad.  Because we haven't been on regular radio, commercial radio, terrestrial radio.  There's a name for it.  Whatever they call it.  There's a million names for it.  In, what, four years?  Yeah.  And, you know, we drive around the New York area, and I see these...  It's funny you said that.  I see these bumper stickers, and it's E and Ant on EW.  Yeah, all peeled off. 
[00:05:30]  Like, the owner even gave up on us.  Like, you know, there was a time he was a hardcore Opian Anthony fan.  He got that WOW sticker at an event or something.  Slapped it on that car.  Or mailed in for it.  He slapped it on.  He was proud of it.  He probably showed people, like, look, man, I'm part of their show, man.  Did it the way you're supposed to.  Maybe put a little rubbing alcohol on the bumper first, so it was nice and clean.  It would never come off.  And then we get fired, and stupid me thinking, oh, our fans will be there for us, man. 
[00:06:00]  They'll wait.  Four years later, you see these bumper stickers.  They're barely hanging on.  There's holes in them.  They're, like, flapping in the wind.  Like Nixon's the one stickers.  Just gone.  Just pathetic.  I love those people that leave the presidential stickers on like they're making a statement.  Yeah, yeah.  Kerry.  Right.  John Kerry.  Peel your Kerry stickers off.  Yeah.  We get it.  Exactly.  So, but it's exciting because now we got brand new WOW stickers. 
[00:06:30]  And they're showing up.  They're starting to show up again in the New York area.  I like it.  And like I said, in the Philly area, definitely.  And, of course, it stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  You get the WOW sticker on your car or a WOW sign or you write it in the dirt in the back of your truck.  And there are ladies out there that will flash you.  Yeah.  That people are getting flashed as we speak somewhere in this fine country of ours.  Just be patient.  There's no harassment involved.  There's nothing on your part aside from just putting the sticker on.  And then you drive around.  A girl sees it. 
[00:07:00]  She'll pull up next to you and lovelies.  It's the greatest radio contest ever.  Yeah.  All those other radio contests are bogus.  You got to do something or be involved or some van has to find you.  One van out of a million vehicles.  I worked at a radio station where I had to go out in the van and search out radio station bumper stickers.  And then I have to pull them over and hand them some CDs or some tickets for some concert.  Did you have a wacky name?  Like Greg Van Driver?  Oh, dude. 
[00:07:30]  No kidding.  There was a guy.  I think it was a BAB where his last name was Van Driver.  And he was the van driver.  Who saw that coming?  What a coincidence.  And they pull you over and most people are like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  I'm trying to get to work.  Right.  You just won.  We saw you had a sticker and we pulled you over and you won these CDs.  Great.  I'm going to be late for work.  You win a certificate for coffee at 7-Eleven.  Oh.  Woo-hoo.  Thanks.  Really?  We're giving you women's lovelies. 
[00:08:00]  We give you nudity.  Nudity.  And the wow stickers are great when you go into the beach, the shore.  Yep.  Concerts.  Concerts, sporting events.  That's when you get the most action, by the way.  Church.  Church.  Yes, of course.  Why not?  Church.  Might be somebody pulling into the lot.  Why not?  Church.  Feeling a little frisky.  Figures they'd get one in before their confession that day.  It can happen.  It could happen to you.  So it's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  We love Wednesdays.  And pretty much it's Whip Them Out Whenever, but we just acknowledge the wow on Wednesdays. 
[00:08:30]  Thank God whenever starts with a W or we have to make new stickers.  Remember Whip Them Out Every Day?  Oh.  Why?  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Or Whip Them Out A Lot.  That didn't work.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Didn't roll off the tongue.  Remember Whip Them Out But Not In Front of Kids?  That was just too long.  So make sure you get your wow stickers. 
[00:09:00]  I don't know how they...  Hey, Ben, how do they get wow stickers here in New York?  You go to Boston.  How do they...  Go on the website.  Go on the website.  Go on the website, the FreeFM website here in New York?  Bang.  And you can get your wow stickers?  All right.  The self-addressed stamped envelope thing works the best.  Philly is finding that out.  Okay.  I've got a close look at that head of hair.  Sam?  Yeah.  Just did.  It is just a questionable voice.  I don't know what it is.  He is the whitest Negro.  Is he black?  Is he white?  No one knows.  He obviously has some colored in him.  But he's totally white. 
[00:09:30]  He's 1% colored.  It's got to be 1% that just took his hair.  Like some 1%ers, it's the nose or, you know, just the basic typical African features  that everyone has grown to know and love over the years.  But him, it's just the hair.  Everything else on him is completely almost...  I don't know.  The eyebrows are a little bushy.  Is it eyebrows to come here?  Eyebrows a little bushy.  But are black people known for bushy eyebrows?  Let's see how big those lips are. 
[00:10:00]  Let me see.  No, because he's got like white boy, like boyish looks.  He has rosy red cheeks.  Yeah, and they're rosy red.  The melanin stopped at the scalp.  There is nothing...  If he shaved his head like people shave their head, you wouldn't know that he had some  black in him.  You could so see a little black.  Where else?  In his eyebrows.  The nose is very Christopher Reeve.  And his eyes are...  He doesn't have like...  His eyes are a little sunken back.  Why, can't he scratch it? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  His eyes are very what?  Nothing.  I thought you were...  All right, Jimmy the Greek.  You want to talk about his extra muscle in his butt?  No, it's just your hair.  After his hair, it's like it was just, you know, just the white Irish take.  It looks very Irish face.  Yeah, yeah.  Very Irish looking face.  And then he's got...  He has thinner lips than I do.  He's got...  Yeah.  But he's related to Thomas Jefferson.  Thomas Jefferson.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson, the bad side of the family.  Yeah, the side that they tried keeping quiet up until just a few years back when it leaked 
[00:11:00]  out that he was having a little fun with some of the house slaves.  The side that's not invited to the family reunions every year.  Oh, Mr. Thomas, what you doing today to me?  I'm just trying to bring out the dinner.  Of course, we're talking about our old intern, Sam, who...  Sam.  Who just graduated Syracuse University.  He's looking for a job in radio.  He's great.  And tell everybody, you're related to Thomas Jefferson.  Yeah, we discovered that...  Well, I discovered that a while ago, but we talked about it last summer, that Thomas 
[00:11:30]  Jefferson's in my family tree, as is Miles Standish.  Miles Standish.  And William the Conqueror.  And William the Conqueror.  So they're all related?  Somehow.  Somehow.  To me.  Who's a broad that slept with everybody in Pilgrim?  I know.  What a famous guy slut she was.  He just passed her around.  She's like that rock groupie that everyone slept with.  Miles, I must tell you.  She's wonderful.  You had your family tree done, right?  Yeah, some...  I love the people that get their family tree done. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  You go to those places, they're not going to tell you that, you know, you're related to  some zero.  To some farmer.  You're related to King Louis XII.  Oh, I am.  He conquered a small nation back in 1528.  Oh, he did, did he?  And he was hung like a horse.  You're kidding me?  Am I entitled to some of them?  Right.  It's always a king or something.  Do you know, as we're looking through there, did you ever hear of King Henry VIII?  Why, yes I have. 
[00:12:30]  Did you know he's your great, great, great, great nothing?  On your mom's, sister's...  Yeah.  ...aunt's, uncle's side?  Really?  ...side?  And then you brag about it.  Yeah.  So, are you entitled to anything from Thomas Jefferson?  Because I know a lot of...  They have like a whole society, don't they?  Yeah.  Of people...  Yeah, good whipping.  ...that are related to...  Oh, jeez.  Yowch.  No, I'm not entitled to anything.  You're not entitled?  Of course not.  Because there are some relatives of Thomas Jefferson that have come forward to feel they're entitled 
[00:13:00]  to something.  And it has been a lot of black people, because he's got some black offspring, because he's  uh, uh, was kind of cheating with, uh, the help.  With the help.  Do you have darker, like, relatives or what?  Good question.  No, not really at all.  You're like the, uh, well, you're not dark, but your, your hair is like the most black thing  in your family?  Yeah, I'm pretty much the, uh, black representation.  Yeah.  For my family.  If you grew that out, would it be a big link from the Mod Squad afro?  Of course. 
[00:13:30]  I did grow it out, uh, a couple years ago.  Any pics?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, please, please bring some in for the website.  He goes, I have to see that.  I'll bring one in.  See, that hair actually goes down to his shoulders.  You just don't know that.  It's so tight and nappy.  Right.  You have nappy hair.  All right, Sam.  Thank you.  So you're like, you're the blackest one in your family?  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  So you're the one on the picnic that they all kind of like talk about and expect.  Stay away from me.  Hey, uh, Jay Moore might have, uh, started something yesterday. 
[00:14:00]  Let me.  He certainly did.  The 30-second radio show.  The 30-second segment.  Yeah, we did 295 30-second radio shows yesterday.  Um, Jared in Boston came up with this.  Listen to this.  Rape kit and crawl space in the morning.  I want to be rape kit and crawl space.  Rape kit and crawl space.  Morning.  How you doing there, rape kit?  In his ADD, Jay blurted out the fact that there's, you know, DJs all over the place, 
[00:14:30]  dopey teams.  Yeah.  And he just blurted out the name rape kit and crawl space.  Yeah.  Which makes sense.  In radio, that would make perfect sense.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear a radio team name that.  Well, you know, I mean, our radio show is named after our dumb names, my stupid nickname from  when I was 12, and obviously Anthony's real name.  I'm just Anthony.  But there are, uh, crazy, uh, shows out there.  Like, uh, what's the one?  Free beer and chicken wings or chicken wings and free beer or something like that. 
[00:15:00]  What?  Free beer and hot wings.  Oh, free beer and hot wings.  Free beer and hot wings.  And you just know how that happened.  You know they were sitting around thinking, what do guys really like?  Well, we can't say that.  What else?  Yeah, what else?  Free beer would be good.  Can we say it if we spell it with a K instead of a C?  No, no, no.  I can't do that one.  No, we can't.  And then what will I be?  That's the best thing ever.  Snipper or face?  So, uh, I guess we're looking for your fake morning show names. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, make them good.  Morning show show names, okay?  Come up with a jingle.  Do you guys ever just have, like, regular show names?  Like, uh, the Ted Best and Carl Frank show.  Nothing.  Just two regular.  That's like the political thing.  Like, you know, Hannity and Combs.  It's not like Zippy Hannity.  You know, he's got a regular name.  It's not, uh, you know, even, even Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, you were Opie well before you got into radio when you were a kid. 
[00:16:00]  I was like 12, 13.  And me, I love when they put...  Seventh grade.  They put Greg Opie Hughes, and the Opie is in the quotation marks.  And then they put Anthony, Anthony Cumia.  And my name is in quotation marks.  No, it's just my name, you idiot.  You don't have to put it in there like it's some fake made-up thing.  Yeah, well, if you want to come up with a morning show show name  and do a little production, we would love to hear from you guys, okay? 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  Because I think we're onto something because of Jay Moore, once again.  Rape Kid and Crawl Space.  Want to hear that again?  Yeah, let me hear that.  This is an example.  We're looking for more of these with other show names, okay?  Okay.  This...  No.  Ooh.  Hold on, sorry.  I'll be scrawling.  No, it's not me.  Okay.  Rape Kid and Crawl Space in the morning.  I want to be Rape Kid and Crawl Space.  Rape Kid and Crawl Space. 
[00:17:00]  Morning!  How you doing there, Rape Kid?  With the wacky horn.  That is awful.  Hopefully we'll get more in.  Hopefully Steve can take it upon himself and really produce this,  because that's kind of funny.  That's something somebody never wants to have in their life, a rape kit.  The fact that they had to make a kit out of it just...  Yeah.  It's awful.  Especially if you refer to your own rape kit as a rape kit.  Like a rapist just thinks, I'm going to grab this stuff and go do it. 
[00:17:30]  They don't actually go, oh no, there's a piece of my kit missing.  So you're thinking of it as the rapist side.  Right.  I wasn't even thinking of it like that.  I'm thinking in the hospital.  Yeah, he's talking like CSI and all that.  When they pull out the rape kit to get all the evidence.  Yeah.  You sick bastard.  No, no, no, rape kit.  To me a rape kit is...  What, duct tape and...  Yes.  No!  I'm thinking at the hospital and the nurse comes in and has to console and I'm so tired.  It's a little plastic toolbox. 
[00:18:00]  It's going to be something we're going to do now that you're going to have to relax and  you know, we're sorry.  And the police kind of ask questions and they swab.  A lot of swabbing is done.  But it's also...  Tweezers.  A proper term for what I'm thinking of too.  I know that...  Of course it is.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  You're degenerate.  Well, I don't know.  I've never been in a rape crisis center.  How do I know what they call it?  Neither have I.  But I've, you know, watched enough television that I know a rape kit to most people.  I think if you mention rape kit, you're going to get the doctor's version of what they 
[00:18:30]  use to gather evidence and not the duct tape, rope, and scalpel.  No, no.  I was looking at it as a proper name.  I thought the guy's name was Ray Kit.  Oh, okay.  My bad.  Now that's completely innocent.  LOL.  Let's go to William in New Jersey.  William, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How you guys doing?  Good, Willie.  Oh, Bill.  Thank God.  So there I can actually listen to intoler...  I can't even speak.  I'm drunk, guys.  Hey.  I can actually tolerate in the morning.  Thank God for you guys coming back. 
[00:19:00]  Thank you, William.  Be nice to the nice listeners, O.P.  I have an idea for a morning show.  Yeah.  Or the name.  Placenta and Friends.  Placenta and Friends.  Placenta and something.  Yeah, I don't know.  And Friends.  That's too normal.  You've got to soften up the show nail.  Placenta should be the second part, too, because placenta and is just kind of an extension  of it.  It doesn't sound right.  I like Chris Calhoun's from Orlando.  Yeah?  He's got Skidmark and Dr. Balls in the midday. 
[00:19:30]  Nice.  How about this?  The Toast and Placenta show.  Toast.  Hey, I lost one, man.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Oh, well, this is...  Well, bird and filly.  How about Hook Nose and...  Hook Nose and Booth Spook.  Hook Nose and Booth Spook.  Hook Nose and Booth Spook.  That's inappropriate. 
[00:20:00]  It certainly is.  I'm sorry.  How about Tony?  Tony, what's up?  How you guys doing?  Hey.  Yeah, you guys are Howard Stern wannabes, aren't you?  Yes, we are, Tony.  We want to sign $500 million contracts and only work four days a week.  That's right.  That's the wannabes that we want to be.  That's the difference is he is special.  Hey, Tony, so you tricked us to get out of the air.  He's special like retarded?  Is that what you mean, special?  Maybe in 1989 it was entertaining, Tony. 
[00:20:30]  It's over.  Watch your hero fade into obscurity.  Watch it happen right under your nose, Tony.  Just watch it happen because it's happening right now, Tony.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Why are you listening to us this morning?  Why not listen to Howie?  Unfortunately, I just haven't put that investment down.  No!  What a big fan you are.  That's why he's only got a few hundred thousand listeners because cheapos like you. 
[00:21:00]  He's not important enough to spend your money on.  Goodbye, Tony.  You're cheap.  He's done.  Go F yourself.  Bye-bye, Tony.  You got us.  Ooh, that hurts.  You know, more people just heard you, Tony.  Than if you called him at any time during his satellite show.  So, congrats.  We didn't even have to work hard on that one.  Oh, well, I haven't made the investment yet.  I haven't made the investment. 
[00:21:30]  You just did our work for us.  You just showed.  The hardcore fans, they went over.  They got some subs.  Not as many as they wanted.  Not as many as they need.  And, Tony, it drives you nuts and it's driving Howard nuts that we get to talk to a lot of his old listeners.  We're sitting here now, pal-y.  Oh, that's good.  And he tricked us to get out there.  Oh, we were tricked.  We love sitting here.  Keep calling, jerk-offs.  Keep calling.  Because this is all you got. 
[00:22:00]  If you can't afford to buy them, you're going to be listening to us because there's nothing else out there.  That's right.  Nothing else that compares.  And how about this?  We're not even going to try.  We don't even try.  We come in here and draw a check and leave.  That's our top priority.  Putting on a show.  Secondary.  This is the mail-it-in and every morning show.  Oh, man.  You couldn't come up with a better name than that?  No, because I was going to say the mail-it-in show, but I said mail-it-in, and you can't follow that.  The mail-it-in and period. 
[00:22:30]  That's stunk, and well it should.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my melons are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.

I got a good show name.  How about the Unwanted Pregnancy and Doc Martin or Coat Hanger Show?  Oof.  Punch it out.  That's a little rough.  Ah, well.  It's a little long.  You'll never fit on a sticker.  Basically, we're looking for the wacky morning show, show names, and then we also want you 
[00:24:00]  to get motivated and do some production around it.  Yeah.  Or maybe Steve will take some of the better names we come up with and he'll produce some  stuff.  No, he won't.  Willie.  Willie.  Not based on what he contributed today.  Yeah, where is Steve?  Is Steve here?  Or is he there?  He's at XM?  We'll have to get into that a little later.  You never know where our staff is.  They're always split up.  Yeah, we got them all over New York City at this point.  Someone is suggesting the pink and stink in the morning show. 
[00:24:30]  I like that.  That's got to be a chick, though.  That's like a guy-girl thing.  Pink and stink?  Yeah.  She's pink.  He's stink.  Perhaps in the media.  Yeah.  Well, we're waiting for the...  Is Travis sleeping today?  Are you sleeping or what?  Is he curled up in the fetal position, sucking his thumb?  We got the phones just lit and I'm just waiting to see what they got. 
[00:25:00]  All right, I got this.  We want to do the Steve thing, but he's not here.  We have to do it in front of him.  No, it's supposed to be.  Steve hands in audio on a daily basis for the show just to get everyone up to speed.  He handed in something.  We have no idea what it is.  Oh, there's a description.  Yeah.  But this is radio.  We love fun audio.  Things, mistakes, anything from the news that's funny or TV shows, radio.  Something that's a gaffe, an error. 
[00:25:30]  Always makes me laugh.  So Steve brought this in today, and I guess it's supposed to be something.  Yeah, don't say what it is.  I don't know what it is.  Because maybe we'll play a wacky little game and we'll play it and see if people can even  figure out what it is.  I have no idea what it is.  And guaranteed he would try to pass the buck off to someone else.  Right.  Because that's how everybody works around here.  They're so competitive and so afraid for their lives here, the people that contribute things 
[00:26:00]  to the program, that they don't ever fess up to if something is funny or if it's theirs.  It's like, oh, where did this come from?  Oh, I found, I think Travis kind of pointed it out.  Steve burnt it.  I'm just handing it to you.  And so here's a clip I got off the news last night.  Oh, is it funny?  Well, you know, someone in my house I heard laughing from the bathroom.  They never want to commit, ever. 
[00:26:30]  And if Steve wants to commit to this, he should be committed.  Steve, I actually explained things to you like it's the end of the explanation, like  I've been talking about it for hours.  Shut up.  Hey, Steve, what is it?  Oh, no, no, no.  Travis had said that you guys wanted this, so I decided just to get it and put it there.  I thought you'd want it.  Like, this is the final chapter in this book.  Yeah, don't ask me another question.  Say, well, you know, Nathaniel, I didn't say that this was kind of the way it was going.  Here it is.  It's what everyone's asked for.  But this stuff has to sound good on the radio.  Yeah.  I know why he handed this in.  Why?  But when you play it on the radio, it makes no sense whatsoever. 
[00:27:00]  Do you think he didn't hear it?  You need to see the video along with this clip.  Oh, he saw the video and heard it and thought it was funny.  So he handed this in.  Let's just play this.  20 seconds.  I'm scared.  Try to figure out what this is.  It's the baptism scene from The Godfather. 
[00:27:30]  I could not tell you what that is.  It makes no sense.  I don't understand even what language that is.  Right.  It sounds Russian.  And then there's some squealing.  And is that applause I'm hearing? 
[00:28:00]  I don't know.  What is it?  I don't know.  There is a description so we can just read it and blow the whole thing.  But later on this morning, we'll get Steve on the radio to explain why he handed this in  and thought it would be great for our radio show.  Hysterical.  Yeah, you can't see him.  Talk about it for hours.  He holds onto his two headphones.  He goes, well, no.  It's supposed to be a...  I just thought it was a crick thing.  I thought...  Yeah.  Here's Steve.  Did you?  Here's Steve.  Steve.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, what's up? 
[00:28:30]  I'm desperately trying to get on a mic because Mars convinced me that I could talk to you  guys real time, but apparently that's not working.  Oh, all right.  Anyway, the...  Oh, the...  What?  The two Czech guys that are fighting at the podium?  That was something that Ben and I saw on the news.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Now, let me guide you through this.  Like I said before, notice, Ben has now been dragged into this.  See, this isn't planned.  No, no.  Hold on, Steve.  This isn't planned. 
[00:29:00]  This isn't...  This...  I've seen this so many times.  I love our staff.  And I know exactly how it's going to play out.  See, Steve has subtly now pinned some of this on Ben by dragging him into it.  I love our staff because if they were on the Titanic and they were hanging onto that  dumb door or piece of wood...  Oh, they'd be pulling each other off.  They would pull each other right off that dam.  Ben, you are now involved in this crappy audio that Steve brought in.  He was saying that you said it was really good. 
[00:29:30]  I might have watched it on the internet.  I don't even remember.  I remember discussing this a long time ago, but it was like two weeks ago.  So, Steve...  Yeah, it was two weeks ago and we saw it on CNN.  And I had someone sent in the clip and I grabbed the audio.  I was like, okay, it's two Czech guys fighting.  It works better with the video.  It was on break.com.  I think that's where we saw it.  You know, Ben lobs it back with the I could have been there.  I don't remember the fence.  It could have been.  I don't know.  It is so typical.  I love the way these guys work.  They're constantly trying to cover themselves by tossing someone else under the bus. 
[00:30:00]  I'm totally copying to it.  I pulled the audio and I...  They're brilliant.  They're absolutely brilliant.  And the I'll overly compensate cop to it.  We don't buy that.  Oh, no, no.  It's on me.  Let's not see.  I understand.  There's a fear that runs through every single member of this radio show.  And you can hear it.  This is a classic example.  The reality is this doesn't make any sense just playing it on the radio.  None.  Yeah, you know what?  Now that I hear it all by itself, it really doesn't. 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  I had a couple of good laughs there.  There was one part there.  No, you did not.  No, I did.  Can we play that again?  When that guy went...  All right, well...  No, no, no.  It was good.  Here's the explanation.  Steve, why don't you describe what's going on as the clip is playing?  It's Czech's health care minister and an advisor to President Václav Kloss got into a fistfight  in a confrontation captured by TV cameras.  Former Vice Prime Minister Miroslav Masakr, a dentist by profession who was invited to moderate 
[00:31:00]  a discussion of Czech dentists with David Rath, slapped Rath on the back of his head in  front of the perplexed audience and TV cameras saying he was settling a private matter with  him.  Rath called Masakr, a coward, and the two exchanged punches.  That's what you're about to hear.  And then the screaming is the audience there?  I guess.  No, it's the dentist actually posting on his radio message board.  Here it is. 
[00:31:30]  I've got to get this.  Oh, that's when he calls him out.  That's when the Falcons flew in.  And scene.  No, that sounds good.  I have it in my iPod.  I do.  Wow, Steve. 
[00:32:00]  Steve, that stunk.  Are you getting enough sleep?  Are you getting enough sleep, buddy?  No, I never get enough sleep.  Roughly four hours an evening.  You know, I brought in great audio today.  Yeah, did you?  You know what we want you to do?  We want you to put that on a loop.  Shut up.  Nobody cares.  That one we just got.  We want you to put that on a loop and play it through a room as you hang yourself.  All right.  I'll go do that right now.  Hey, what audio did you send in today?  Yeah, what's the great stuff for today?  Audio of a cop withering the National Anthem at a memorial service.  Yeah, we'll save your ass by playing this right now. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, gee, thanks.  How generous.  Ooh.  I don't like the way Steve is nipping at Ope's heels and Ope's being generous and good.  Because Steve feels that that was good audio.  You could tell by his reaction right there.  No, I will, I will, I will.  No, I love when, when, when.  I do.  Well, it's funny.  It's funny how Steve wasn't watching anything with Ben.  Now the good stuff's coming.  Yeah.  Where'd you get this?  I sounded on my own.  Well, I know this could land flat on its ass, too, but, you know. 
[00:33:00]  Honestly, it's not.  This cop just butchered the National Anthem.  It's pretty funny.  What's the story?  What's the memorial?  What, uh, the guy?  Bye, Steve.  Goodbye.  Goodbye, Steve.  Let's go to Scott in Modesto.  Scott, what's up?  Scott in Modesto.  I got a good morning show for you, fellas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The fetus and cement shoes in the morning.  Fetus and cement shoes?  That's it.  That's a nice ring to it, right?  Mm.  All right, let's go to.  Cement shoes is too long.  Let's go to John in Jersey. 
[00:33:30]  John.  Yeah.  Hey.  I think Steve's explanation was even funnier than the bit that he sent in.  Of course.  It always is.  Right.  All right, thank you, sir.  When me and Ben were watching, did you see it?  Yeah.  Pay attention, people, because you'll notice that every time they give us something that  bombs, someone from the staff, they will always drag someone in with them.  That should be a fine morning show starring some of our own people, the Buck Pass and Zero  Show. 
[00:34:00]  Dan says it all from New Hampshire.  Nothing better than visual humor.  Yeah.  On the radio.  Great stuff.  All right, here it is.  Cop screws up National Anthem.  During a memorial service, not sure which city, a black police officer steps up to a podium  to sing National Anthem, which he proceeds to butcher.  The audio you're about to hear is cut up, but only because the accompanying video is edited.  So I guess they go through where he butchers it.  Don't you?  Dude, if you're singing the National Anthem, shouldn't you, if you aren't absolutely positive 
[00:34:30]  of the words, have them in front of you?  That's the one...  At a podium or something?  That's the one song you don't want to butcher, too.  You do not want to ruin the song by forgetting the words or...  All right.  You can't wing it.  No.  No.  It says he stinks and has no business singing in public.  Yeah.  His voice is really bad.  Listen to this clip.  I brought it myself.  No one helped me.  I videotaped this.  I was there. 
[00:35:00]  Stayed up late editing all by myself.  Ben wasn't involved in this.  Ben, I had it.  He had it, Ben.  What'd you do, Ben?  Don't.  But he don't bother the boss.  Maybe I don't know.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, say can you see  By the dawn's early light  What's so hell as well as  What?  As the land's gleaming 
[00:35:30]  What's right  Who brought it aside  O'er the rapids we walked  I know  I know  I know  The stars 
[00:36:00]  Home of the free  Home of the free  You idiot  Oh, how embarrassing  That's really bad though  Yeah 
[00:36:30]  How do you  The Spanish version is actually better than that  That is horrid  He didn't know the words  Free  Didn't get the true feel  And meaning of the meaning of the song  Did he  No, it wasn't me  A karaoke  Ah, well, what do you think?  Steve redeemed himself  Yeah  Yeah, I mean, you know  That was  That was  It was good  It was very good audio  It's wonderful 
[00:37:00]  Let's go to Eric in Connecticut  Eric  Hey, good morning guys  How you doing?

Get in there  Hi, Ben  Hey, we're going to have to take a break  But something we wanted to play yesterday  But we were doing the ADD show with Jay Moore  Yeah, we got to know audio yesterday  And we love audio  There's something where we've begun  It's called Homeless Radio  Yeah  See, that's what's great  We have this second show we do every day at XM  Mm-hmm  And we really get to experiment  Because it's free form over there  Yeah  We talk for like an hour straight 
[00:41:00]  Hour and a half sometimes  And we get to really  No break  And we get to really experiment  And try out some crazy things  And then we bring some of the more interesting experiments  That work back over to this side  Yeah, some things that don't have as many curse words in them  Or at least give you a little taste  And we started this homeless radio  And Tippy Tom was the first homeless guy  We had just decided to leave the studio  We left the studio for like an hour  And Tippy Tom took phone calls  And did a radio show  Really? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, Tippy Tom, a homeless guy with AIDS  He's gay  He's a mess  He's got bugs  Please tell me he sat in Anthony's seat  Stinks  No  No  He sat in your seat, I think  No  Where were you?

[00:42:00]  Alright, here's what I'm saying  I'm saying that  The Tippy Tom's show is going to go on right now  Now, what I'm going to say is this  Is that  I'm so happy to be over here  At this station  And everybody nice to me  And I feel special  And yes  And I'm very happy  And so  What I'm saying is that  They helped me out very much dearly  And let me hang out  And be me  And thank you for that 
[00:42:30]  Okay, now I'll get over that  That's the intro to his radio show  Very good intro  This is something we talked about in the past  If one of these radio stations in New York  Was brave enough to just throw a homeless guy on every day  And just let him roll  It would get massive ratings  Let him talk about anything he wants  But no one really has balls in radio anymore  Here's Tippy Tom  Finally taking some phone calls  And I think in this clip  It's short  He talks about the problems we're having with Iran 
[00:43:00]  Hey Tom, you want to take some phone calls real quick?  Oh my God  I'm a headphone dude  All right  Here we go  Luke  What's going on with the headphones?

Hey, I'm wondering what your ideas are  For the rising tensions with the nuclear problem in Iran  With nuclear weapons  Oh, well, I don't know about that 
[00:43:30]  The nuclear weapons in Iran  Well, we'll call upon higher forces  And we'll go over there  And take all their bombs away  So they don't have none  It's real simple  The United States of America  Is the most powerful country on Earth  And we can take what we want  And that's the way it is  He sent his shoeshine rag undies over there  They'll give up, believe me  Brush them over the face of the enemy troops

[00:44:30]  I want to talk about the price gouging  Of the oil industries  You don't got bad air  No, what are you talking about?  He wants to know about  What do you think about the price gouging  Going on in the oil industry right now?  How are you going to  How would you fix the price gouging?  No, oil prices are coming down, by the way  The prices of oil is coming down  Because they have to  Are we going to buy nothing?  How are we going to run these cars?

[00:47:30]  And maybe not been very attractive  Very young  And you invite them in  And they do what they're being paid to do  That's why I take a face full of humiliation  This one  I was on Craig's last night  And I just had a  I got bitten  Oh, no  I got bitten by the lonely bug  Yeah  I wanted some company  You're trolling around  Yeah, and I found one  And you found one  Pretty 5'11 blonde

Yes  Okay, alright  Kind of  Kind of  Kind of  I didn't want to  Kind of 
[00:53:00]  E-Rock, do you have a guess?  Alright, alright, alright  Wait a minute  Wait, Ovi's got an answer?  I want an answer  I am very confident  With my answer  The old  Bait and switch  Absolutely  That's exactly what it was  Bait and switch  So obvious  Because if this girl  Showing up  If this girl  Showing up at your door  You're not going to  Have a problem with her  Not even  Even if she's missing  An eye  An ear  You know  Whatever damage  I was thinking  Yeah, teeth are out  Whatever damage 
[00:53:30]  That fuzzy is covering up  You're not  You're not  Telling her to go home  Not even if she had  An added appendage  You just take it like a man  What if it's like  Pitbull attack  And it ripped half her face off  And she's waiting  For a face transplant  You put the sheet  Over her head  And just  Doesn't matter  Who cares  I say  A completely different girl  Showed up at the door  What did she look like, Jimmy?  What happened?  Here's the way  I can describe her  She had a sweet disposition  And she looked like  The Hawaiian version  Of Natalie  From the Facts of Life 
[00:54:00]  Oh my god  It wasn't even close  It wasn't even  And it was 5'11  And the girl walked in  She had heels  And I'm like  Well, she's a little  Little bigger  Than the other girl  Because I didn't remember  The picture  And then she stepped  Out of her heels  And I was like  And she went  Pomp  Pomp  It was like  Well, what the hell  Did you say?  She stepped out of her shoes  5'11  5'11  5'10  5'9  5'6  5'4  Going down  2'1  2'1  2'1  2'1  She jumped off  Her stilts  Right  And at first 
[00:54:30]  That's a model  Is what it comes down to  Yeah  I was going to be  The good guy  And I brought her  To my bedroom  She had candles lit  And  Of course you did  You think this hottie's coming over  Did you go  Follow me, fatty  No, she wasn't really that fat  Like if I met her somewhere  Like anywhere  I would sleep with her  But it wasn't what I want  I'm the customer  Yeah  So I said  I brought her in my room  And I just got angry  At the woman  Who I talked to on the phone  Because I was going to go to bed  I have to get up  This was like 12 o'clock at night  So I'm like  Look, I got to get up in the morning 
[00:55:00]  I got to be responsible  I can't be hooking past 1  So I'm like  Maybe I'll call you tomorrow  And the lady's like  No, no, no  She'll be there in 20 minutes  And I'm like  She will  And she's like  Yes  So the girl came 20 minutes later  But it wasn't the one I wanted  Yeah  So I told the girl  Like, look, you're really sweet  The agency  She told me what her name was  And I'm like  Oh, you know  And she's like  No  And I'm like  I know that's not you  Oh, so they didn't even  She didn't even try to say her name  She knew it wasn't  She knew  Because she knew that I knew  And she was nice  She wasn't a liar  And so I call the agency 
[00:55:30]  And this scumbag woman  Who answers the phone  I don't know what I expected  Like a woman of integrity  And fine measure  Sending other girls  Out to prostitute themselves  For drug money  You know  I'm expecting, you know  A business integrity  I'll call the Better Business Bureau  On you  Well  Well, let me tell you  There's been a mix-up  That's right  Mr. Norton  We do apologize  Let me talk to customer service  I didn't get to dehumanize  And humiliate the person I ordered  I mean, there really is no  Hello, my name is Rob  What is your problem? 
[00:56:00]  Customer service?  If you've been bait and switched  Press one  If it's a man  Press two  So I said, look  I said, nothing  I was really nice to her  Because I wasn't mad at her  If I had met her  In a different circumstance  I was more annoyed  At the agency  And I wanted them  To get nothing  Than I was at her  So I slipped her  A little something  Just for coming  She knew what happened  Hawaiian Natalie  Is all I'm thinking  And I would be so annoyed  At her  The company  I wouldn't call her sweet 
[00:56:30]  And say I'm sorry  About the mix-up  It would be  Get out fatty  No, she was nice  I have candles lit in here  Old lamp oil  Blubber legs  She was okay  Hey, Judy Blum novel cover  Come here  How much worse  How much worse was she?  It was, again  It was more like  From say a nine and a half  Down to like a six and a half  But it was more  I was so angry  I called the agency  Well, she goes out  Under that name  I'm like, look, sweetheart  Pretty much  When you're expecting this 
[00:57:00]  Coming to the door  And you get that  Yeah  And I even said  It's the girl in the picture, right?  And she's like, yeah  Who's coming?

[00:57:30]  The phone will ring  Yeah  The phone will really ring  So eventually  I'm sure  Well, the pests need a mission  They've been just  Hanging low lately  The ONA pests  Well, I'm sure  They'll get one in pal talk  That is really nasty  Yeah, man  They baited a scumbag  How bummed were you?

[01:01:30]  We had Jason on yesterday  In an interview  That did not go the way  We wanted it to  Because we loved Jason  To be honest with you  That's the  Call from Rikers  It would have been  A great interview  But Jay Moore decided  At that moment  To get completely naked  In the dunking booth  And jump on Bobby  Who plays the no homo game  We've discussed on this show  Well Jay also  We told him later  He didn't know  That we really liked Jason  Jay Moore had no idea  He just unfortunately  Had bad timing  With his bits  So when you go to a place  Like that 
[01:02:00]  Where you're spending  Real money  I mean you're getting  The person that you want  It's like you're looking  On the web for the person  That's the person  You're going to get  Yeah  And I'm looking right now  At a baby with an arm  In the middle of its chest  I'm just looking at  A three armed baby  On the nose  Oh from some  Far away Asian land  Do you fix that  Or do you sign him up  For every sport that exists  It's like  That is fantastic  It is three perfect  Little baby arms  How do you play sports  And hold your pocketbook  At the same time  Get the audio of that  You have to leave it 
[01:02:30]  Why do you take the arm off  I don't care  As long as he's healthy  As long as he's got  Ten toes and fifteen fingers  Oh no he's a mess  Oh what is that hand  Oh this kid's a mess  Oh boy  You could still use it  For something  Like what  I don't know  You could catch your own pitches  If you're batting  The one arm is always in the  Oh  Like when you take your  Like the old drat  When you make a fist  You make a fist  And kind of swing it  In front of you  And go  That's how the baby's arm is 
[01:03:00]  Two regular arms  And there's one that looks  Like little weird fingers  Yeah like stubby fingers  At a show  You can clap  While still eating popcorn  That's right  There's some very handy things  I'm applauding  And eating a jalapeno popper  At the same time  Top of that  Except the one arm is  In the middle of the chest  So the jalapeno like  Is being snuck under the shirt  And then up through the collar  Into the mouth  It's just creepy  We should get into a discussion  On freaks after the break 
[01:03:30]  Oh  The two little girls  They're probably grown by now  I'm sure they are  That it was a two headed girl  Two headed girl  She really was connected  Like one single body  Right up to the shoulders  Then the shoulders got a little wide  But there was still just two arms  Two arms  Two legs  One you know what  And two heads  And two heads  Two heads  So we had a fine discussion about that  With two independently thinking brains  Yeah  One body  How do you live 
[01:04:00]  Dude how do you use a restroom  How do you use a restroom  How do you  How do you like have sex  And get married  And have a relationship with somebody  When you're sharing the goods  You gotta schedule your vag  You gotta schedule  Yeah  You gotta pencil it in  On a little scheduler  I don't like black guys  But I do  Right  Oh  Yeah then there's the whole thing  Of what you know  You're wrecking our merchandise  The guys would get all jealous  Right  Like you're with the same bottom part  Doesn't matter which face you're kissing 
[01:04:30]  You're rubbing  And then there's the other guy  Laying next to you  And he's the husband also  What is it  You split into like  You rub the right leg  I'll rub the left  And if you rub the left  You're cheating  But they show this thing  Like riding a bike  And swimming  It was  The thing  The creakish  What else are you gonna call it  It was really really creepy  What do you do  If you're having sex  And you get the ugly one  What if the ugly head likes you  What do you do  You have to like pretend  You're not looking at the cute sister 
[01:05:00]  Who's three inches away  You're just trying to have a good time  And you have to go  Turn your head stupid  And then what happens  If you wanna roll her over  Do the guys have to  Switch sides of the bed  You'd have to  Cause the head is on the other side now  I'm sure the guys aren't there together  Well  And then  Why not  Nah it's just too creepy  It'd have to be  You wanna sleep with your wife  And then there's two others  That just make us laugh  The uh  The uh  The older women now  That uh  Were joined at the head  That one wanted to be a country singer 
[01:05:30]  That is one of the best stories ever  Yeah  One wanted to be a country singer  And the other one was condemned  To lie on a gurney  Like  They had to figure it out  When they were kids  I think the one that was on the gurney  Wanted to be the country singer  By the way  Really  Yeah  And the other one wanted to be a  Tragic  Just a regular gal  Yeah  And the country singer  You know because she's in showbiz  Had to have her side of her head dyed  Yeah they were connected  By the top side  Kind of of their head  It's one of the greatest stories ever  By the top of their head 
[01:06:00]  So one of them had to lean over sideways  And the other one was on a gurney  Right  And the other one got highlights  Because she's a country western singer  So they had to like  That's all good on stage  Like those houses in Queens  That are connected  And the shingles are different colors  It's like that's how their hair was  One wanted red hair  And the other wanted brown  So they picked a dividing line  And dyed the hair to different colors  And one had longer hair than the other  Yeah  Even though they're pretty much sharing a skull  Yeah  An oversized skull  What do you tell the hairdresser  After you walk in and she goes 
[01:06:30]  Okay  I want half of mine red  Oh lord  Won't you buy me  A backbone leg bends  They had to decide at some age  Which one was going to get the gurney  And which one had to bend over sideways  For the rest of her life  And then the other girl  Has no desire to be in these smoky bars  As her sister is trying out  A country western career  And I have to go to all the gigs obviously 
[01:07:00]  And she just sits on stage  While the other one is singing  Oh  She's bored  She's heard these songs before  A brilliant time  Stand by your thing  Give him high hills to head to  I'm trying to go with  Achy breaky myself here  Achy breaky skull  Dreaming of an achy breaky skull 
[01:07:30]  I can't get enough  When that crap is on  Discovery and all that  Oh I know  TLC is the new freak show channel  And then the other one  The brothers  I think they're in Chicago  Yeah these are another pair  That were just fantastic  They were connected  They have four legs  Yeah they were connected  At the torso  But I think  Did they have four arms  Or just two arms 
[01:08:00]  I think they had four arms  But two that pretty much worked  And the other two  Just kind of hung  So they were kind of  Separate at the legs  They came together  At the torso  And then split apart again  As they got to the head  So they definitely had four legs  Two heads  Definitely four legs  And they were playing baseball  They liked to play baseball  And their normal brother  Would pitch to them  Yeah would pitch  And one would be the catcher  And one would be the batter  And then he would hit the ball  But he would always be out  Because the catcher 
[01:08:30]  Would either hold him back  Or tag him out  Yeah once you're the catcher  If the catcher's attached to you  It's sort of detrimental  To your game  They would actually  Remember the Asian brothers  Ang and whatever  The other guys  The famous Siamese twins  The way they would work  Is they got married  To two different women  They both had families  They would stay with one family  For like three days  And the other family  For four days  They would split their time  Between the two homes  Yeah  That was how it worked  Instead of all being  In one big disgusting  Incessant  Do you realize  Those two were only connected  By a very thin  Skin on the chest 
[01:09:00]  It was like  They stayed together  And made their clothing  Look like they were  Really together  Yeah all they had  Was an inch or two  That was it  Yeah  They could have been separated  Why weren't they  Because they made a lot of money  Being like a Siamese twin freak show  Oh they  They didn't  It wasn't a fear  That they would bleed to death  No no  Well I don't think  They had the  The medical advances either  I think it was very risky  I don't think they shared  Anything like organ wise  Yeah  I think it was very minimal  But for the time  I think it was still  Risky surgery 
[01:09:30]  But it could have been done  They said  Yeah  You know I would have  Just separated  And then just like  Alright look  For the act  We'll make believe  We're still together  Yeah just make believe  Who's gonna know  Do they have two arms  And two legs each  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah they did  Yeah  How awkward  Gotta look at that dumb face forever  They made a bloody fortune  For themselves  And their extended family  I'd rather be broke  Yeah and be able to walk around  Without somebody next to you  All the time  What do you want to do  If you make a lot of money  Get this creep cut off you  It's the only reason  To earn money  So you can not look at that 
[01:10:00]  Dumb face  Which looks exactly like yours  Mama  Don't let your babies  Grow up  To wreck photos  That's from  Flying Standby  And then Booby Man  From Brooklyn  Jesus take the wheel  And this mess  Connected to me  That's a Carrie Underwood  Country song everybody  It certainly is  What else  There's a million  Coming in now  Do you think  The ugly head  Tries harder

[01:15:30]  And always flexed  The other lacks a palm  The decision should be more clear  With the time  As they can watch baby JJ  To see which he favors  I think that's  That's critical  Is determining  Uh which of these arms  Works better  According to Dr. Larry Ollier  JJ's prognosis looks good  Surgery will likely be performed  By the time he's a year old  We have many children  In our practice  Who are born with  No arm  Or no hand 
[01:16:00]  Who function in a way  That would just amaze you  They can tie their shoes  They can do anything  Your eye can do  His future friends  Will probably never know  About his unique condition  But it's one  The medical community  Will never forget  Wow  Leave it alone  Just a cyber sex  Right  Yeah  You know how inconvenient  It is  He types really fast  Typing work in the mouse  You never have to  Move your hand  And also for grabbing  Asses on the wall  Because you can hold  A box with two hands  And you can use that  To poke through 
[01:16:30]  And grab it  And they'll go  You pig  Wasn't me lady  Look at me  I'm taking out a television  That's the bit  Very good  How great is that  Alright  Yeah we  During the break  I was punching up  A bunch of  Conjoined twin stuff  God  What a bitch  This is  Most people  I mean  What are the odds  That you're gonna be  A conjoined twin  It's pretty rare  Right  Probably three or four  Out of ten  Could be less than that 
[01:17:00]  It's probably  You know  One in a million  If not more  Well if you're connected  By the top of the head  That only occurs in  Two percent  Of the people  That are conjoined twins  So that is  Unlucky lottery  And very rare  To have successful  Separation  They have names  For all these people  That if you're  Connected at the chest wall

[01:21:30]  Why would the pro-choice people  Be against the doctors  If they're pro-choice  Why would they fight  Anything the doctors  Are doing anyway sir  I'm not sure what you mean  Well not necessarily  Pro-choice  But all these people  Who rally up against  You know a woman  Who wants to have an abortion  Well that's not necessarily  Pro-choice  That's pro-life sir  That's completely  The opposite of the spectrum  You can't say  Not necessarily those people  It's completely  The opposite people  He's just saying  That maybe it's God's will  To have three arms  To become a priest perhaps  And read the Bible  Light a candle 
[01:22:00]  And tussle a young  Alto boy's head  At the same time  Good tussle  Little tussle  Of his long blonde locks  That's a good point sir  Or actually not only  This way if he happens  To be the Messiah  As they're crucifying him  He can point fingers  At people  And you  I still am angry at  And you  I'm not happy with  You  Get back to work  Oh I will get you back  Especially  That's right  We don't know how  To nail this third hand  It's just pointing at us  It's scolding us  All the carbon

Well we got some examples 
[01:23:00]  From around the country  The listeners are really  Helping us out  Oh by the way  No you don't  You think it stinks  Just like we do  I think people know that  No they're funny  They always have something  They are horrid  Unless they're talking  On the teleprompter  They don't know  What to say  And they try to  All these morning shows  Try to have this cute  Banter back and forth  And it's horrific  They don't know  What the hell  They're talking about  And there's a weatherman  Here  I don't know  What the hell  There's nothing  In his head 
[01:23:30]  He is devoid  Of anything  He can read  A teleprompter  And you know  See the H  On the map  The second the woman  Tries to talk to him  It's over  And every morning  They try to talk to him  And we just stop  Doing what we're doing  To look at the screen  To see what babble  Is going to come out  Of his mouth  And usually  It's absolutely nothing  Katie's crying  Of course she's crying  It's her big day  It's her last day  Goodbye Katie  What are they singing to her?

[01:30:30]  There's not one person  That has a cigarette  In their hand  And in their mouth  That's going  How did this happen  Right  I just woke up  And I was smoking  You make a conscious  Decision to pick it up  And put it in your mouth  Or what about  What do you mean  This is bad for me  Everyone knows  We didn't know  You know  Back when I started smoking  We didn't have  All the information  You have  Right  That stopped  Being an excuse  In 1908  This generation  Knows 
[01:31:00]  Enough  Stop you know  Scaring us  With these commercials  Even though it satisfies  Your t-zone  Taste and throat  Have a lucky  Strike cigarette  It satisfies  This guy's t-zone  Yeah  It's missing  That fear  His throat's missing  It got me to stop though  I gotta say  Because  Because we all know  It's dangerous  But it becomes  It's almost like death  It's an intangible threat  You can't really see it  But that's like a way  Of looking at it  Going  Let the people smoke  Who doesn't want  A shorter commute home 
[01:31:30]  Smoke all you want  Less people  Less traffic  That's what I say  In Atlantic City  In the bars  That are in  Like I was in Trump  And there's a bar  Right in the  Big atrium  That the casino  Is on both sides of  You could smoke  In that bar  You can't smoke  At that bar  But you can smoke  In the casinos  So there's just smoke  Billowing out of the casinos  They don't want to lose  That money  But you can't smoke  In the bar  The greatest place  I ever saw smoking 
[01:32:00]  Was in Rochester  At their  What is it called  The Rochester War Memorial  And they have minor league hockey  And they had a smoking area  That was like a glass room  Oh the glass rooms  At the airports  Have them sometimes  Oh okay  And they called it like  It had a nickname  Like the tomb  Or something like that  And I had a couple friends  Back then  That had to have  Their cigarettes  So I would go in there  With them  With my beer  Like you guys  Hurry up  With this stupid habit  And the smoke  In this thing  Was just unbelievable  It doesn't matter  Everything in those rooms 
[01:32:30]  Are yellow  And dripping  The grills  That is supposed to exhaust  They completely contain  The cigarette smoke  In one glass room  They'll sit in there  With their yellow eyes  And their nails are yellow  Right  Oh  Hey someone has a comment  About this commercial  We're about to play  Anthony in New Jersey  Anthony  Hey how you doing guys  Hey  How's it going  Alright  I was wondering  If anybody knows  This guy didn't lose  His Mexican accent  With the voice box  How does it work  Are you kidding  Does the voice box  Come with a Mexican accent 
[01:33:00]  I'm serious  In that exact commercial  If you watch it again  If you guys get the audio of it  You still hear it  Through the voice box  You hear a nice thick  Mexican accent  How great it would be  To have a voice box  That makes you speak English  Perfectly  And you're not allowed  To sing the Spanish  National Anthem  That it'd help  Alright  Well here's the  The creepy commercial  Or part of it  I was during night  When I got  Drove cancer  From a smoking cigarette  I almost died  Now there is 
[01:33:30]  The permanent hole  In my throat  Nothing will ever  Be the same again  Nothing will ever  Be the same again  I hear a smoky cigarette  Got the throat cancer  Nothing will ever  Be the same again  He did have a Spanish accent  He really did 
[01:34:00]  Esmogging  That's just  Esmogging  We don't need to see that on TV  Swaps out the hole  Life is hard enough  We don't need to start our morning  With that commercial  They're trying so hard  To get people to stop  That and those  Damn truth  Commercials  Where the kids man  They're gonna show the man  And big tobacco things  And it's always some  Young go-getters  That are doing something  That's totally staged  And fake  Like dropping off 
[01:34:30]  Body bags  In front of a  Big tobacco place  They never say a brand  It's just  You could see right through them  Just stop  You wanna quit smoking  Quit smoking  It's not as much  An addiction  With people  As it is  A great habit  It's enjoyable  It's fun  It's something to do  When you're out drinking  It's a habit  It's more habit  Than addiction  You just put 
[01:35:00]  The god damn thing down  It's possible  After a couple of days  The habit is broken  Heroin  That's an addiction  Cigarettes was tough man  That was  I mean  Four years  I've been awful  But once in a while  I still get an urge  Cigarettes is a real rough one  It's rough  Because it's something  It's more of a security thing  It's something to do  That's  It's fun  When you're out drinking  With your friends  To smoke  Why is it  When you're drinking  You could smoke 
[01:35:30]  Ten packs of cigarettes  And then when you're  Just hanging out  You might not smoke  That many  What's the difference  In your body  That's so  This physical addiction  I'm talking about  You get this  Physical  The nicotine  I need it  I'm addicted to it  How come some days  You can go  And smoke five cigarettes  And you're satisfied  Yet when you're out drinking  Boom  Two packs are gone  Did you need more nicotine  Or was it the fact  That one hand's got to drink  The other hand's a little awkward  You're going to smoke  It's more 
[01:36:00]  Mental  Yeah  Addiction is always part mental  Yeah but it's so much more  Mental than it is physical  That nicotine addiction  Bull  It's a big one  Bull  20 fixes a day  If you're smoking a pack  Put it down  The problem I have  With big tobacco  Big tobacco  Big tobacco  Look if they didn't lie  I would have  I would have no problem  With them at all  I would  I could care less  Like you know  It's a legal product  You should be able to smoke it  I love they sell a product  That kills people  Oh it's amazing  They get away with it  But they lied 
[01:36:30]  And that's the problem  And they lie  And that goes into it  And you've got to sign  These confidentiality  Why do you have to sign  Confidentiality clauses  At least  There's no lying  With a Chesterfield  It satisfies your T-zone  Taste and tracheotomy  With that  Let's take a break  It's the ONA virus  Spreading across America  A lot of good phone calls  Coming in  We'll go to the phones next  And we'll also get into  Some of this newscaster improv stuff  I love showing my  Introverted fat guys

[01:40:00]  They do well when it comes to reading  But when they have to improvise about some dumb thing  They just lose their minds  You know it's funny Katie's retiring  And she's dropping a little tear  As stupid Matt Lauer is talking about her  But you watch when she's reporting  On infant deaths or murders in Iraq  She won't ever drop a tear  For anything that she's reporting  They're just such disconnected idiots  Members of the media  Well then you got Ann Curry  Ann Curry  Who should have had the gig  But she stinks 
[01:40:30]  And so they had to pass her by  Al Roker  Stop pretending he is more  He should be forced to sing Old Man River  Every time he does  The weather  Well Al Roker was sitting on the couch  With Matt and Katie  As they were reminiscing  And Katie was dropping a few tears  And you could see it in Al's face  Like ooh this means more air time for me  No it doesn't  You're black  It doesn't  It doesn't mean more time for you  He is the  You know  I'm sorry  Like uh  Like uh  The sidekick  Yeah

[01:41:30]  Yeah they're doing a montage of Katie Hitch  When she met Mr. Rod  Oh this  It doesn't get any  Jim Carrey being nutty  I wish we had the volume  This is good  Ah Beyonce  Alright why don't we  Why don't we do some newscaster improv  Okay  We've been teasing this for a few days now  A little improv  A little improv  So yeah when they're not reading  It gets a little silly  And uh  We have some listeners from all over the country  Sending in  Their local newscasters improv-ing  Okay  Here's the first one  Weather guy says good morning

Because there's a really good joke in there  They might have been saying something else to me  And you're supposed to think like  Oh what were they saying to this nut  Are they trying to fill time?  Is that what it is perhaps?  They're going stretch  Oh  Because that was 
[01:43:00]  I know I am completely distracted  With this awful retrospective  They are doing on Katie  There was one they just did on Katie  Where they were flying her back and forth  Like Peter Pan  And all I could think of is Omar  Coming out of the helicopter  They should have put her in a green outfit  And a hat  Put a rope around her neck  And lynched her from a helicopter  Now she's skating  Now she's swinging like Tiger Woods  Well  Almost like Tiger Woods  Yeah of course it went in the hole Katie 
[01:43:30]  Of course it did  Yeah this is who you want  Reporting on the Iraq war  Just dope  Why are they giving her so much publicity?  Well  She's going to another company  Well she's been part of our mornings for so many years  I hear they're going to let her go to this other company  And then sue her  She wants her old tapes  Her old tapes back  Alright let's get back into the newscaster improv  Or we can just watch TV  It's up to you  Yeah we'll get back into the 
[01:44:00]  Into the radio show that we're doing  Improv  At this moment  As we watch TV  Or we can do a little mystery science theater  And just kind of comment as they show Katie  No  This is all being taped  And we will pull the great great moments out of it  We're trying to get the crying clip  Before we end the first half of the Opie and Anthony show  Alright newscaster improv  The next one story about a leftover dorm room item  Turns to improv  Weatherman makes awful transition  Here it is  Well summer's almost here  That means college kids are coming back home 
[01:44:30]  Yeah but sometimes they leave a mess behind in the dorms  You know this year the University of Nucle Dome  Came up with a solution  Okay  At Notre Dame the campus leaders  Are holding a yard sale this weekend  For all the junk the kids left behind  Wow  And mangy rascals  Anything left behind  Clothes, furniture  Even a pair of crutches  Can be sold  Who leaves behind their crutches  Guess they don't need them anymore  Somebody can walk  The money goes to charity  I remember I left behind some plants in the dorm  And I went back to get them like three days later 
[01:45:00]  Gone  Toast right  Gone  Yeah  Don't know where they were  Well these are going for auction for charity  Somebody had some daisies somewhere  You like your flowers  I do  I love flowers  And good weather for flowers  It is  I didn't even have to water mine yesterday  Because of that rain we got  We got a little rain yesterday  And again another chance for rain today  A little pop up shower  It is  Is it Tuesday?  It is  Why not  Let's go get it  It is Tuesday  Happy Tuesday  Wow  This idiot had daisies in her college dorm  What a fun date she must have been 
[01:45:30]  You want to come over and water my daisies?  Yuck  She had plants  She left them behind  And someone stole them  Exactly  They threw them out  They were in a dumpster upside down  What do you think someone made all of them?  Yeah no one cared about your dumb plants  Unless they were pot plants  That was great banter though  You see how uncomfortable they get  When they know they've reached the point  Where they have to transition back  Into what they're supposed to be there to do  And they don't know how to get into it  The plants  But they  Well they got water yesterday  Because of rain 
[01:46:00]  You're the weatherman  Going to talk about rain are ya?  Do they teach this stuff  When you become a newscaster?  I don't know  You know what it is  They're all talentless hams  There's nothing worse than being a ham  Without any talent  They want to be  The center of attention  They want to be somebody  They want to just shine somehow  And then they're given a moment without script  And they just  They just completely collapse  In a heap of witless shame  And then they segue with a daisy raining joke  Well we got another example here 
[01:46:30]  Reporter makes bad joke  Well if you've ever had a few too many  At your favorite bar  You may soon be getting a lecture from the loo  It's really safer  And a hell of a lot cheaper  Than a DWI  Talking toilets  Could soon be coming to a bathroom near you  The Whiz Mark is making the toilets talk  With their flashing lights  And several slogans  They're reminding you to call a cab  If you've been drinking  Instead of driving home  You know some companies  Are appropriately named  Aren't they?  The Whiz Mark  That's great marketing right there 
[01:47:00]  Well it is game one of the freeway series  Between the Dodgers and the Angels  Jim Hill is here with a preview of sports  Jim  The real problem is when you talk back  Now you got real problems  The Dodgers  Oh you're talking to the toilet  Because it's talking to you  I think the more important thing  Is the things you can make that toilet say  Why would you make it say something health conscious?  How about you program it to say  I'm hungry  Get over here  Or make the yummy noise  This isn't news  Jimmy's been paying for talking toilets 
[01:47:30]  For quite some time  The seat is a big mouth  With teeth painted on it  Put your boss's picture on the back  LOL  A lot of people all of a sudden are asking  Why haven't we played Howie baseball yet?  Or it's the same guy  Just using a bunch of different names  On the instant feedback  We'll play Howie baseball  We're collecting some of his old stuff  We want to take a chainsaw to that couch eventually  Because it's just awful

Yep  Once again  Very good  Back out with Jägermeister  Very nice  Well I want to get back  To the Andy Garcia thing  Yeah yeah  Let's get back to Andy  So it was removed  And that was it  And now there's just a scar?  Yeah  Just a scar  I don't know what they did 
[01:59:00]  With the tens  Well hey  Here's a commercial  It's on TV  With the guy  With the hole in his throat  Yeah we were talking  About this guy today too  Oh man  He's got the voice box  And the tracheotomy  And he's pretty much  Telling everyone  To stop smoking  De Niro  Should be shooting him  Through a towel  Let's go to Casper  Casper you're on  The Opie and Anthony show  Hey guys  Was that the conjoined  Twin Al Niri  Was kissing at the end  Of Godfather 3  Wow

[02:00:00]  There are people  That will stand  It says don't walk  And they'll walk out  Into the street  And take up an entire lane  Yeah  Now meanwhile  I'm trying to drive  In that lane  And you gotta stop  And beep the horn  And then  I got great windshield washers  I think they did this  On purpose  Where if I turn them on  Water will spray  Five feet  On either side  Of my vehicle  So as I make the corner  Boom  I hit the washer  And you're just watching  Your side view  As they go  What the hell  Like they don't know  What hit them  Where the water  You get hit with water 
[02:00:30]  In New York City  It's gotta be bad  You should sprinkle  Some anthrax  In the white  Working on it  Just to make it  More lively  You do make a good point  Though  When you get splashed  With water  In New York City  It's never good  It's never good  You don't know  Where it came from  And all of a sudden  You get like a sprinkler  You're like  Ah whatever  Yeah that  It's some dew  On a tree  Or something  But when water  Drips on you  Here in New York  In the city  It's bad  It's never good  Even if it's just  Condensation  From an air conditioner 
[02:01:00]  It's probably got  Legionnaire's disease  In it  It's gonna be awful  Alright let's say  Hi to BCH  BCH what's up today  Hey guys  It's BCH  From Unmentionable  Fansite  I was wondering  If before they removed  Andy Garcia's  Conjoined twin  It said  Quaid  Start the reactor  Open your mind  Quato  Good old Quato  Quato  What was his name  In that  What movie was that  Total Recall 
[02:01:30]  Total Recall  Oh he was in that  Yeah  Where Arnold Schwarzenegger  No he wasn't in it  But his little growth  Was  Quato  Yeah Andy Garcia's  Growth was in that  As Quato  We just noticed  Arnold Schwarzenegger's  Name and everything  Is like  Hi my name is  Burt Johnson  He's always got  Some stuart and name  This is my wife Jane  All I remember  Was the midget  Firing  A female midget  Firing a machine  Machine gun  A boost  Yeah yeah  She's the hot midget  Yeah  That's like  You look at her  And go  I would do that midget 
[02:02:00]  It's like the only midget  You would ever have sex with  I've never thought that at all  You've never  You would not do  The Total Recall midget  Not even  Just as a goof  She wasn't sexy  As a goof  On any planet  You'd have to  No  You know  Dude you gotta  Have sex with  The Total Recall midget  You push her down  In front of like a donkey  And watch her step on her  As a goof  There's the goof  You know how funny that would be  Just to see her naked  Would be hysterical  Yeah exactly  And then the act itself  Would just be a scream  Wasn't he Doug Quaid in that movie 
[02:02:30]  Quaid  Yeah  And Hauser  At least that's kind of a German name  Yeah very good  You're all immature sociopath  I don't have to do a radio show  Well you have to know this stuff  To do a radio show  My name is James Baker  No it's not  You Nazi  Yes  I was shot by Hinkley  How do I do impersonation  Do you think it was the real thing  I am Tony Manero  Hey uh  Listen man 
[02:03:00]  You got any tricks today  Oh I got a number of things for you  Yeah  Yeah  What do you got  Uh oh man  You like science  Everybody likes science right  Sometimes  I do  Wait just to give you the set up  I mean you're doing the  Jaeger Meister music tour  And you're one of the freak show guys  Right I'm the host of the tour  I come out and basically function  A lot like an MC  But a lot more gross and graphic  Now I want to describe you a little more  You have a black outline of scales  All over you  Right  And then most of them  At this point are colored in green  Right  So you look like you have green scales 
[02:03:30]  Exactly  You have round nodules  That are implanted in your eyebrow line  Your brows are shaved  Teflon implants  They're Teflon  So it gives this lumpy brow  They look like pachinko balls  Yeah  And if you're a Republican  Yeah obviously  Republicans love me  Who books that lily pad  Your teeth are filed  My eyes are frogs laughing  Teeth filed to points  Teeth are filed to points  And this is all over your body  This is my entire body  Yeah and what's going on with your ears 
[02:04:00]  You have  Earlobes are stretched out to about an inch  Earlobes stretch  And you've got some Jaeger Meister  Yeah I've got Jaeger Meister caps in them right now  You know being the good corporate shill  And your face is completely tattooed  Yeah  Right  Completely  And then like we said before of course  The split tongue  The split  Yeah his tongue is split right down the middle  And um  Are lizards tongues split?  There are  I don't recall  There are two different types of lizards  That have split tongues  Yeah  Generally monitors are the ones  That you normally see with a split tongue  Right with a split tongue 
[02:04:30]  Yeah  But something like an iguana  Has a regular tongue  Right  There's a sort of base  Your gecko would have a regular tongue  Yes  Why isn't your palms done?  Huh?  Because the palms of your hands  Don't tattoo well at all  So it's kind of pointless  Oh right  And you know  I actually have had my fingertips  Tattooed  It's actually a geek tattoo  It's computer gaming letters  But I have weird hobbies  Hey slap me five  Lizard side  But yeah  Tattooed with a palm  Just a bad idea  Wasn't a lizard  Okay  So what do you got? 
[02:05:00]  Because we're running out of show  Here we go  Um  This is  We talked last time I was here  About an act that I do  That involves lizard juice  And the equipment's kind of hard to travel with  But I've worked out a way to do it  Without the heavy equipment that's involved  We're going to call this a gastric siphon  Okay  I am getting really disgusted  And I don't want to be close to this  Explain what you're  Because I have a feeling  I know what he's going to do  Wait  There's a whole new audience  That's never heard you on our show  Right  But basically you're  You're going to put a tube down your throat  To get some of the juices out of your stomach 
[02:05:30]  Right  That's a basic idea right here  This is just some nice clear surgical tubing  We're filming this for our website by the way  We'll lube that up  Yeah  This is where the kids in science class can get it  It's going to be a good video for him  Up your nose and then down?  Up the nose and down  Yes  Oh my god  Okay  That's close to four feet of tubing  Going in the nose as we speak  Now he's trying to suck it  Through the back of his throat 
[02:06:00]  I'm a little gassy  Suck it  I'm getting a little tickle in the bottom of my stomach now  Wait that's going all the way  How far down is that right now?  This will go all the way down into my stomach  And coil up a little bit  Oh god  Yeah I can actually do a little more  But I think for this one  This short tube works better  Now I need a  Wait how many feet are in you right now?  I'd say probably about two and a half to three  I think  Have you ever seen that?  We've seen some crazy stuff on the show  No where would I see that?  On this show we do this stuff  The plastic tubing went in a nostril 
[02:06:30]  And all the way down to his stomach  Now he's got some Gatorade in his hand  Now this is the art section  If you remember your basic color pattern  Yellow and blue make green  So we'll add the yellow  Alright now he's drinking some Gatorade  He's holding the tube  So nothing leaks out I guess  Just to explain further  Like about eight to ten inches of the tube  Is still hanging out of his nostril  He must be thirsty  I was going to say  The rest is in his stomach  All the way down to his stomach  There's half of that one  Alright  And now he's drinking 
[02:07:00]  A little bit of the old blue  Windex  Alright  Now he's doing  Sometimes refer to it as Smurf piss actually  I think this is a good bit  I'm mocking your problem  Alright  Yellow and blue  Oh  Actually do we have a  You need a little more blue  No  My hands will allow it  Up here would be good  Alright  She was right 
[02:07:30]  See  The doctors told me  It was the lizard man  But I knew  Alright he's drinking most of the blue Gatorade  Can you stand over to the left  A little sweetie pie  Thanks  Alright we're filming this  The video will be up on  One of our websites later today  Wow  He's drinking more  Gotta get an even mixture I guess  I'm just waiting on the cup here  Oh yeah  Hey  Alright so what  Do you need a cup  Because now you're going to  Regurgitate it out of your nose  From your stomach  With the tubing 
[02:08:00]  That's in there  This becomes the siphon part  The siphon part  So we'll be able to siphon this  Who's getting him a cup  Otto you need an opener  Now the rest of this  We can just do it back into this  Yeah why don't you do that  Alright  You can even  That's good enough right there  Good enough  Good enough  You can dump the  Dump the rest of the blue out  Yeah  No he doesn't have to  It'll fill up  It'll fill up  Now if you've ever had  If you've ever had an aquarium  This is the same basic process  He's  Okay now he's siphoning  Oh god damn  Oh no  Oh Jesus  He's siphoning it out of his stomach 
[02:08:30]  With his mouth  Like  Like you siphon gas  Out of  Oh  Holy crap  He's siphoning  The tube is now  Oh this is not right  Alright hold on  Now the tube  Is back in the Gatorade bottle  He's siphoning  He's trying to fill up  We've got a  Little bit of a  I think a little of my breakfast  Is in there  Oh god  I'm going to vomit  Yeah there's like  Red  And there's like  Brain matter  Can we get somebody to drink this  Wow  No we shouldn't 
[02:09:00]  I give you 20 bucks  Alright here we go  He's siphoning again  You're going to have to see  The video later today  We're filming this  Here's the tube  What did you have for breakfast  In the Gatorade bottle  I think that's mainly  The milk for my coffee  Stuff in there  I do have some  Some bugs with me  I'll get to that  In a little while  I am so skeeved out  Right now  Alright he's trying to siphon  He's trying to get this going  Oh what's  Look at the big  Like hunk of something  Oh my god  That's what it is  What is that  I could probably use some Durano 
[02:09:30]  God there's a big hunk  Of something in there  Yeah  It looks like stew  He's pushing the tube back down  Like stew meat  He's now siphoning again  He's sucking through the tube  To try to get the siphon going  I can't look  Did he chew or just hammer it  And then swallow it  I can't look  You got anything going there  Lizard Man  Oh I can't look  We're running out of show  The first half of the  Opium Anthony show  Is almost over here  We're going to be on the street  With Lizard Man  And Otto and George  In a few minutes  As we walk over to XM  To continue the show  Alright what do you got  Going on there Lizard Man  And once I get this clog through 
[02:10:00]  I think we're going to be good here  Alright  He's trying to shove  One of the clogs  Through the tubing  I'm recycling my own ass juice  It's actually pretty good  That I can actually just do it  Alright  We're trying to get this going  Before we get out of here  Don't forget Otto and George  Friday and Saturday night  Bananas  Hasbrook Heights  Otto you're going to  Continue the show with us  Right over to XM  Yeah man do the walk over  Yeah  Alright  Wow he got some major fluid  Coming through the tube now  Major fluid  Wow Jimmy can't look for once  I find this fascinating 
[02:10:30]  Yeah I can't  I can't  I thought it was going to be  One big one  There's this little clump right there  Yeah  Yeah I see the clumps  In the M.P.

[02:50:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show with Otto and George and Lizard Man.  Lizard Man.  Good old Lizard Man.  We got some Katie Couric audio we're going to get to before we get out of here today. 
[02:50:30]  Last Comic Standing was on last night.  Do you think Willie Nelson's braids are really his hair at this point?  Because he's all gray.  But his braids are brown.  Yeah, he probably just dyes them or something.  Yeah, why not?  He's got some gray going into it there.  Don't you think he weaved them in there now? 
[02:51:00]  Nah, that's him.  He looks exactly the same, by the way.  We interviewed him like seven years ago.  He looked exactly like that.  Guy hasn't aged since he turned 70 or whatever he is.  What's the putt?  Is he 70?  I don't know.  He's up there.  He never looked young.  Exactly.  He always had that wrinkled face.  Yeah.  Steve Misereck died.  Fuck is that?  The pool guy.  Even when you're just showing off.  That guy.  Who?  He's a pool champion.  He used to do a Bud Light commercial.  It's a Miller Light commercial.  Miller Light commercial.  He had a gallbladder surgery or something and complications from that, right? 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  You know who else died?  Who?  The principal from Breakfast Club.  Alex Toth.  Oh, I remember that guy.  That guy.  What did he die of?  Some kind of asbestos thing.  What?  Mesothelioma?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ew.  Lung cancer.  Wow.  That's not lung cancer.  It's mesothelioma.  But he died as well.  Asbestos poisoning.  I think that's what got Steve McQueen, too.  Because he was wearing all these asbestos suits for his stunts and racing, stuff like 
[02:52:00]  that.  Really?  I'm not getting it.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Tim in Michigan.  Tim.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I want to sign up for your big ball competition.  I'm a fucking white guy.  I got a small dick and huge wrecking balls.  Girls love it.  Wrecking balls.  How big?  I mean, you know, they're not baseballs, but they're not grapes either.  It's not how big they are.  It's how low they hang.  It's almost ugly.  I sometimes hit the bottom of the toilet with my nuts when I'm shitting. 
[02:52:30]  You know, I get the water on them.  I got to pull them up sometimes.  It's like dipping strawberries.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I'm all for showing them off.  I've done like, you know, up in, uh, showed them at, uh, like, biker competitions and shit  with big guys named Tiny.  I beat Tiny once in fucking South Dakota.  I'm a, you know, I'm a little guy, too.  It's just big old balls.  All right, let's be honest with, uh, each other here.  Um, if we officially announce this contest, a lot of people are going to be pointing fingers.  It's so gay.  And, and, and, yeah, they're going to be yelling, gay, so gay. 
[02:53:00]  But I think if one of the listeners wants to just show up and kick off the contest, we  can see where it goes.  We don't want to be sitting around hoping that, uh, contestants show up.  No, I don't want any part of this.  You know, with all sorts of production pieces by Steve.  P-choo, p-choo.  The big ball conqueror.  With the most fabulous contest ever.  Do you have what it takes?  You know.  Steve will be auditioning people in his fucking studio over there.  And the worst thing is we're actually going to be depressed if a guy has small balls.  Like, ah, your balls aren't big enough. 
[02:53:30]  Right.  Who's going to judge?  Hey, on Monday, I'm a tour bus driver.  I'll be in New York.  Can I show up on Monday?  Tim, you show up Monday with your ball bag.  All right.  I'll be there Monday morning for the XM part because I swear a lot.  All right.  Who's going to be the official judge for this contest?  Me.  I mean, um.  All right, Tim.  I'll be there.  I've already applied for intern around the Fed, so I'm on this.  Tim, just show up.  Trust me.  I'm there on Monday morning.  You might be kicking off the, uh, the big ball contest.  Big Bobby waving with his mouth. 
[02:54:00]  Where's that?  All right, I'm on it.  Thanks, guys.  Where's Kenny?  Uh, he had to go get our smoothies.  But he got mine already.  Oh.  Yeah.  Where's Kenny?  He didn't leave, did he?  He wanted out because Lizard Man was going to eat stuff.  He couldn't take the eating of, uh.  He's scared of some small bugs here.  Kenny left.  Kenny left.  Kenny left.  Kenny left.  Kenny left.  Put some mealworms in his not-nice suit jacket.  Kenny's the comedian around here. 
[02:54:30]  All right, so you're just going to eat, uh, mealworms?  Yeah, like I said, you were having a snack, so I thought I'd get these out and just kind  of crunch a couple up.  Oh.  Why are we not videotaping this?  I can't.  Why would we?  Why?  Why would we?  Why?  Why?  Hold on.  Show the camera behind you.  There's a mealworm in his tongue.  He's, uh, swishing around, and now he's going to crunch it.  That's pretty.  It's making a crunchy sound.  How is it? 
[02:55:00]  It's actually good.  They taste a little bit like spicy mustard.  No, they don't.  Yeah, they do.  Go ahead.  Try one.  Come on.  I don't like bugs.  All right, let's go to Bill in Brooklyn.  Bill?  Uh.  Bill?  Hello?  Bill.  His girl has a huge clit, and he wanted to bring her in.  Well, bring her, Bill.  I don't need to talk.  I knew that would, uh.  Then why the hell did he go away?  Bring her in, Bill.  I knew that would make Jimmy happy.  That's my thing, big clits.  Fuck the big, uh, testicle contest.  Get a clit contest.  Lizardman, I gotta tell you something.  No one's impressed with the mealworms.  Yeah, no.  You're gonna have to go bigger. 
[02:55:30]  All right, you wanna go bigger?  Yeah.  All right, we got something a lot bigger here.  I think you'd like this.  I want that big clit, man.  Fuck.  What the hell?  Wait, explain what the hell.  It's an oversized corkscrew.  Yep, oversized corkscrew.  That's about, uh, three inches, four inches in diameter, Anthony.  Right?  Huge.  Huge corkscrew.  Yeah.  All right, where's that?  Try the wine!  Where's that going?  Explain what you're gonna do.  All right, we're gonna insert this into my head and see if I can't actually traverse my entire skull with it. 
[02:56:00]  And then play Twister?  Exactly.  All right, the camera's to your left there.  Here we go.  This is Lizardman with a giant corkscrew going in his nose.  Dotcom.  What a fucking show-off.  And now he's spinning it.  Oh, man.  What?  He's completely spinning the corkscrew through his nose, out his mouth.  I help won't allow it.  Oh, God.  Don't you, uh, Tremiser?  Uh-huh.  When did you realize you needed attention? 
[02:56:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And this would be the way to get it.  Right.  Does it hurt?  Uh-uh.  Let me fill your glass.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, God.  That's, uh, I got it.  Uh-huh.  And then he licks it off, and it's...  Well, it's his own dab.  I'm glad to see you appreciate good mealworms.  That's pretty impressive there.  Still looking for the right wine to go with him.  Hey, this guy's a fucking asshole.  The Eggermeister music tour.  That's right.  Down at Nokia tonight. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, Nokia tonight?  Yeah, Nokia tonight.  What bands are playing, by the way?  We've got Hurt, Three Days Grace, and Stained out on the road with us this time around.  Cool.  Stained couldn't come in here?  Not sure what they're doing.  Don't know what they're doing.  What's wrong with these bands?  Stop at the Attitude and come hang with us.  Well, maybe they weren't asked.  We requested Stained.  Oh.  We requested Snow Patrol.  Red Hot Chili Peppers supposedly were coming in.  Godsmack was supposedly coming in.  Got to start calling Ben out on this.  He was talking about all these bands that were going to show up. 
[02:57:30]  Not one band has shown up.  We showed up at K-Rock over there.  Ben was like, dude, the Stones are going to be doing an acoustic thing with Mick Jagger's  going to be...  What?  Fucking Bono.  Sure.  Bono's going to run the board.  Why isn't Stained here?  I know they're still doing well, but them playing a song or two on the show would be huge.  Hey, Ben knows.  Why no Stained there, Steve?  Apparently, according to the record label, they're not doing any press.  Why?  I don't know.  And we've been trying for weeks to get them. 
[02:58:00]  Why wouldn't they do press?  That was the answer we got.  Band isn't doing any press.  Yeah, because you don't want to, you know, get your name out there.  I'm so sick of freaking rock bands.  Then why are we promoting the band?  I am so sick of rock bands.  No promoting, then.  Rock bands stink.  And then you bring them in and everything has to be perfect, man.  So you have your coffee and shut your fucking face.  How great was Ozzy when he came in?  I'll keep bringing it up.  He had his water and he was fucking hilarious for an hour.  Fuck you in the ass.  That's what you want, a guy.  No attitude, he just shows up and he's funny.  Yes. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  Any other tricks there?  Yeah, actually, I brought on the man that I usually use, actually, to bring on our headliner  for each tour for the last couple of years.  This is the amazing Dr. Griff, as we like to call him.  Of course, in our line of business, doctor, always just an honorary title.  No medical degree here for him.  Could you get a wireless mic on?  No.  That would really help us.  Dr. Griff.  Dr. Griff.  Anyone.  Oh.  Dr. Hawk's scowl.  Oh, Hawk got a little bit of an attitude.  Fuck you, Opie.  Well, we can either do it, you know, or we can do it your way and he can just talk into space. 
[02:59:00]  I mean.  Eric, comment.  Eric, face.  Facial expression that says, fuck you, Opie.  No, no, I understand.  You know, the one you just did.  Yeah, it was this.  It was, yeah, do it, Jim.  Get the camera on me, son.  There it is.  Sorry, the WWE site will be there.  Where can I get my Hulkamania sticker?  You know what we got to do in the very near future? 
[02:59:30]  One day, we're just going to randomly fire somebody.  That'll get everyone back on their time.  Oh, nice.  Just randomly fire someone.  That's a good one.  Right.  And you watch how people, you know, step it up.  It shapes up pal talk all the time when I just randomly.  Yep.  Just randomly fire someone and you hear them say, but, but, as the door slams in their face.  Let's make sure it's a Jew.  That's good, Brett.  Our star search spokesmodel has corduroy pants and huge testicles.  No bagel sticks and they didn't have anything we needed.  Oh, no. 
[03:00:00]  Why, why, why, why, why?  It's an empty bag.  That's what I wanted.  All right.  That's good.  Bottle of water and some ketchup in here, I hope, right?  Hey, but I want something.  Fuck, is that Ted Bundy lookalike that brought you breakfast?  That's fucking Sam.  He's a distant relative, but he doesn't like Bundy.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson, Otto.  He craves me.  I don't really.  Wow.  I don't want to play.  On the bad side.  Oh, Jimmy.  On the bad side that they don't like talking about.  What do you got?  Jimmy's throwing his food into the garbage.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I got that eggs.  Huh?  I got the bit of ketchup, the fucking Brooklyn Diner. 
[03:00:30]  Eggs.  All right.  All right.  What are your mother's cunt, Ben?  I should fall face first into the eggs.  My health won't allow it.  No.  All right.  Let's get back to it.  All right.  Here we go.  This is going to be the greatest act you've ever seen, but he's never got to see it at all  because what he's about to do is take these two steel hooks he's got in his hands right  here and insert them with surgical precision into his eyelids.  Joe Cotton's on the Atkins diet.  All right.  All right.  Ready, doctor?  Wait, what?  I'm ready. 
[03:01:00]  Okay.  Here we go.  Take the first hook.  Insert it.  Those big hooks are going into your right eyelid.  Slide that one right in there.  I'm getting them, man.  I'm feeling in my ball bag.  Wait.  Is it going through the eyelid?  It's perfectly.  No.  No.  It won't.  It's just hanging on the bottom eyelid.  Ideally, it won't pierce through, but we can't guarantee it won't accidentally happen.  You guys could be the first.  We do not need the mic.  Why did you think like this?  Yeah.  Move the mic out because he's going to have to work by taste, touch, and smell alone to  find the straps on those bottles.  You can't see?  Wait.  No.  He can't see the damn thing right now.  I think he's got an eye cold.  Hold on.  Before you do this, I want to explain. 
[03:01:30]  I mean, they're seeing it on PalTalk, but there's fish hooks.  There's fish hooks.  In his eyes.  In his bottom eyelid.  Bottom eyelid.  But not piercing through.  Not piercing through.  Hanging through.  And now he's got Jägermeister bottles.  And he's finding the straps on the bottles and attaching them to the hooks into his eyes.  I told you to leave that alone.  He'll gradually take the tension out of them.  All right.  He's going to try to lift two Jägermeister bottles.  Take a moment to set yourself.  And when you're ready, go ahead and lift them up there, Doctor.  Go ahead and take a small step back. 
[03:02:00]  Now, once he's got them there and he's got them hanging, this is the better part because  this is where we look for the crowd.  Get them to get a little bit more over this way.  You can't look at anything right there.  I think you're good right about there.  Right there.  All right.  Now, give them a little swing back and forth for them.  Really let them see something.  Look at those corneas and the retinas.  You can see it all in there.  Hold it.  Oh, get it in there.  Oh, and he teared up a little bit.  We had to pull out.  A little bit of pull out there.  That's pretty impressive.  Oh, my God. 
[03:02:30]  That's got to be like putting your contacts in.  You know what I love about PalTalk?  Every girl on PalTalk is doing the hand to the mouth.  Thanks.  That's right.  I've gotten that reaction many times.  With a hand to the mouth, they can't see it.  Right.  I'm thinking we should do it again but get a nice close-up for everyone on PalTalk.  I don't think they really fully enjoyed it.  You can do it again.  Blank it, clear it out.  You ready to go again?  I'm ready.  All right.  E-Rock, set up the camera better.  Suddenly, I want a job.  E-Rock, use the wireless mic.  Set up the camera better.  Maybe you need a little help from the ten guys that are in the other room just standing there. 
[03:03:00]  They really are doing it.  Hey, bags of shit.  You want to jump in here and help?  I love the abuse today.  Holy shit.  Bags of shit.  I probably won't be any cars anyway.  All right.  Hold on.  Climb up on the table if you have to.  Get that one right there.  This is worth a really good close-up.  Just rip it through.  Get up there.  Fucking around and rip it.  We still need him for tonight, so we don't want him to tear out.  Greg it out.  No, just, you could do a, you could do a, you don't have to go all out.  I just want a nice close-up for Pal Talk. 
[03:03:30]  Ow.  Yeah, I love looking at the girls on Pal Talk.  They're all freaking out.  All right.  He's doing it again right into the Pal Talk camera.  There's the Jägermeister bottles hanging basically from fish hooks that are attached to his bottom eyelids.  These girls are squirming.  You got them squirming.  We usually get a couple of pass out each night in the show, but invariably afterwards, everybody  comes up like, what does it take to get out on tour?  What does it take to get out on the road and get on the bus?  I'm like, well, as soon as, well, no, that won't get you out on the road. 
[03:04:00]  That'll get you on the bus for about 15 minutes, but then we'll get together.  Once somebody beats this, we might add another person to the crew.  That is very impressive.  Thank you, thank you.  It takes a lot to impress us in here.  Damn.  And that definitely impressed us.  What do you think, Otto?  I think you should rip his whole face off with squirt lemon juice in the wound.  That's the encore, actually.  You know what trick I want to see?  Somebody bringing me ketchup and water. 
[03:04:30]  Good luck.  My eyes are tired.  Hey, did you officially start the Fat Smash Diet?  Congratulations.  I just threw my bagel out.  All right.  Less carbs.  Very good.  Less carbs are good.  No dessert today.  Threw it out because he didn't want it.  No, I didn't want it because it's too fattening, but I had cereal this morning.  And you enjoyed, what were those things that were sent to us yesterday?  Where are those cookies?  Where did they go?  Last time I saw them, Big Cat was holding them.  I'm sure he gave them to somebody.  I only had two.  Because he can't smell, so why would he bring them home?  So what's your goal, Jim, to be a well-toned, little, chinless jelly bean head?  I want to be a svelte. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, svelte.  I want to be a lady killer.  A Svengali.  Oh, God.  I had one of those yesterday, and they were delicious.  They were good, right?  And I got one, and I went around looking for another one, scarfed up by I don't know who.  Who?  Was it?  Why are you whispering?  You said Poe.  All right.  We'll say it.  His eyes are tired.  Thanks.  Iraq is throwing Poe under the bus.  So what happens to the eyes now?  On the cookie scandal.  And why doesn't it poke through?  Because I guess the hooks are a little obviously dull, but they're still like weight. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, the hooks are dulled, but just to transfer the weight on the hooks isn't too much.  Is there any sterilization process beforehand?  You might have noticed him licking them before he put them in the eyes.  Licking them off a little, make sure there's...  That's perfect.  Yeah.  Stick them in your eye.  A little spit.  Once in a while, every couple months or so, clean them a little bit.  Gasoline from a go-kart.  That probably works good.  It works good.  Light it up.  Only the finest medical sterile conditions we use in our show at all times.  That's right.  Jägermeister Music Tour at the Nokia Theater tonight. 
[03:06:00]  That's right.  And go to, I think, JägermeisterTour.com for other people.  JägermeisterMusicTour.com.  I'm sorry, JägermeisterMusicTour.com for other people.  Tour dates and links to the Lizardman site on there, too.  Awesome.  About 10 dates left.  Anything else?  We could throw some darts if you like.  Yeah, well, let's do a dart thing.  Go do some darts.  All right.  What does he do with the darts?  Oh, that's right.  Last time we asked you to do this.  Darts are fine.  We just didn't have them with us last night.  Is your cock tattooed, by the way?  Hey, just on the base a little bit.  Do we got Limo Anthony?  That's not a real hook.  I'm telling.  Do we have the Limo Anthony dart bit yet? 
[03:06:30]  That's in the book Obits.  Yeah, we got to get that one.  Remember that, Anthony?  God, he's making my eyes hurt.  The XM listeners are going to love this.  We had a guy that was such a plug whore.  We brought him in, and he said he would do anything for plugs, so we decided, all right,  let us throw darts at your back, and every time a dart hits you, you can plug your limo business.  With hepatitis?  Otto and George were this weekend bananas, right?  In Hasbro Heights?  Hasbro Heights, yes.  I'll let you guys...  The darts first, so they were sterilized.  I'll let you guys choose.  You want front or back on the darts? 
[03:07:00]  Both.  Both?  Wow.  All right, we'll do both for you.  No, yeah, both.  Yeah, both, because you might hit her nipple.  Where are we going to stand?  So I can stand here.  All right.  Now, if you get hit in the spine, that could not...  No, I don't want to get hit.  That will not be a good thing, obviously.  Well, that's one of the reasons I also keep him around.  He's an excellent shot with a dart, so I'm pretty good, and I've actually already...  Why does he throw a test dart?  I want to see how good he actually is.  Try to hit Christina Aguilera's anus.  Yeah.  Right there.  Let's see how... 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, let's see how...  He's throwing that dart, though.  Huh?  If it hits the wall, it can't hit him.  Yeah, because it's got to be cleaning.  Oh, then fuck that.  Oh, fuck that.  Let's have him hit the guy again.  He only got three.  He only got three?  He can pull out and reshoot it.  Oh, sure.  Well, how silly I am.  Yeah, you can always pull out and go...  All right, hold on.  We got to set this up better for pal talk.  A side view, maybe?  You want to get on the table?  You want to get over there, E-Rock?  What do you want to do?  Hold on.  He's going to...  If we got this pal talk, Cameron, we should...  Take a dump on that yellow notebook paper.  Sorry.  That's an idea, then, Judd. 
[03:08:00]  Ow!  I get a little preparing.  I just got his notes.  That's fucking pathetic.  Nice, crispy slap.  Hold on.  Let me just...  All right.  I guess we're ready here.  I'm a lawyer paper.  My last appearance is lackluster.  Yeah.  The part of the first part.  Yeah, it is on...  On legal notepad.  Bring in the...  Hereforth, I will be known as...  Suck that cock.  Bring everyone in for this.  I want to get the reaction.  You get a part of me about a yolk? 
[03:08:30]  We're going to get the...  I guess it's fleet week, because we got some sailors outside.  You call these ketchups?  My sailors.  Eat your $27 egg whites and shat up.  There they are.  All right.  Here's my two fat friends, Joe Conti and James, before and before that.  That's really funny.  All right.  So we got Lizard Man.  He's obviously topless with all his tattoos.  He's...  His back is facing the dark guy, and dark guy is going to just throw darts into his back. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Anytime you're ready, go ahead and let one fly.  Ow!  That kind of went right into his spine.  Wow.  That's funny.  Wow.  That's...  Oh, no.  Okay.  It's to the right.  All right.  It's a little bit to the outside.  Almost in the shoulder.  God damn it.  The right shoulder blade.  Just below the right shoulder blade.  Go ahead and throw another one to the back.  We'll pull him out and do him again in the front.  All right.  Here goes the second.  It's a little close to that first one.  Tender eyes in that area.  Keep them close. 
[03:09:30]  Good group.  Hit the 20.  Good grouping.  All right.  Here's the third one.  Want me to get some money on it?  Oh, my God.  That was a good one.  Right in the middle of the squirrely tattoo there.  Don't put a lung.  Go ahead and pull these out.  Oh, my God.  Look at them pulling out.  Oh, nice.  Pull to the skin and torture it up a little bit.  Jesus.  How many dart holes you got in you?  You know, I don't know.  We probably throw an average of 1,000 darts or so at me a year.  1,000.  A lot of fun.  All right.  Now we're going for the front?  Yeah, we'll do a couple in the old chest. 
[03:10:00]  Do they really hurt when they hit you?  Yeah, it's like a bee sting.  It's over pretty quick.  All right.  Just remember, no nipple, bitch.  No nipple.  Has he ever hit the nipple?  The first night we ever let him throw at my chest, I turn around in front of 3,000 people  and I go, and not the nipple, bitch.  First dart.  Funk.  Right into it.  Wow.  It must have got a crazy reaction from the crowd, right?  It got a crazy reaction from me.  It got charged him across the stage.  Throw it at his cock.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Right into the heart there.  Upper chest.  Dart right into his upper chest.  Have you checked how much real estate is between your skin and your heart?  Yeah, you might have to know that.  It's just enough, I think, because I'm still here.  A little bit less than that.  If you think you can throw right above the mic, you might be able to get the thunk on this.  We'll see.  What, you're going for the breastbone?  Yeah.  Oh!  Wow, did that make us thud.  Apparently, we could get the thunk there.  They're right in the muscle tissue.  You can see the movement right there. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  That's nice, huh?  Listen, man, you too have just impressed me.  Regular.  That was the one that impressed me.  That doesn't hurt at all.  Oh, no, it hurts.  Why not the reaction?  I just, you know, I've been doing it for years, and I've got enough conditioning there where  I'm kind of used to it.  I don't look a little blood.  A lot of people are very impressed with the sound that that last art made.  Ha, ha, ha.  He's not lobbing them in there.  I didn't think so.  Jump through a closed window into a box of IV needles.  By the way, Joe Conti has a talk show on local TV in New Jersey. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  He does a one-on-one interview inside of a hamper.  Ha, ha, ha.  You can hear it if you're standing right next to the hamper.  Ha, ha, ha.  What's the name of the show, Joe?  Planet Jersey.  Sounds good.  Planet Jersey.  Planet Jersey.  You'll be shy and retiring, douche.  All right.  I wish that planet would spin off into the sun.  When does Planet Jersey air? 
[03:12:00]  What?  I didn't hear you.  All right.  Why would you?  He's only two feet in front of you.  Free plug for millions of people, and you freeze up like a cunt.  I'd like to see Lizard Man play that dart game with Magic Johnson.  Why?  Your turn.  All right.  I think we'll let Lizard Man go.  Cool.  Lizard Man, another bang-up job, my friend.  Thanks for having us in again.  Want an aspirin?  No.  I don't take aspirin, actually.  Really?  I don't take it.  It's bad for you.  No painkillers.  What did they use to lizard up your eyebrow there? 
[03:12:30]  Well, the implants themselves are pieces of Teflon.  There's five pieces carved and put in over each eye, but I was actually cut to the bone,  opened up, elevated the tissue off, right to him.  How do you find a doctor?  What kind of a doctor?  Yeah.  He's actually a...  Doesn't he try and talk you out of it?  He's a former biomedical device engineer, not actually a doctor.  Wow.  But he created the tools that are used to do it and came up with the procedure.  We will put the Teflon into the eyebrow line of the Jew.  It's a variation of things like chin implants that have been done for years. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, they have them?  Yeah.  Oh, damn it.  Can you find this guy in the Yellow Pages?  No, you won't find him in the Yellow Pages.  Most practitioners, like what he's done, are referred by customers and friends.  There is a network online and a couple of different sites that I work with that we help people  that are interested find each other.  Very nice.  This guy's getting impaled with lawn darts and you won't eat a yolk?  That's right.  I'm a yolk.  He started a Fat Smash diet. 
[03:13:30]  We're all proud of him.  Really?  Yeah.  He started today.  Right?  No, but I mean, I'm getting there.  He's getting there.  I'm ready to go.  All right.  Jägermeister Music Tour.  Lizard Man.  Nokia's Theater tonight.  JägermeisterMusicTour.com for other tour dates.  That's right.  Very impressive.  Thank you, Mr. Lizard Man.  Bye, guys.  Stars smile strong.  There they go.  Lizard Man.  That dart stuff was, uh, wow.  You heard that thud.  Oh, awful.  Mm-hmm.  And then he's pulling the darts out.  When you think maybe the dart isn't in that far, he pulls it out and it pulls the whole 
[03:14:00]  skin away.  So that guy's really descendant of, uh, who?  Thomas Jefferson?  Thomas Jefferson.  Yeah.  He has an old family tree.  And Thomas Jefferson...  Mulatto's not correct anymore, right?  Mulatto.  Yeah, it is.  It is?  Yeah.  Half a spook.  What do they call?  I don't know.  Mulatto.  A mulatto.  Mongrel class of interns.  He's a nigger rican. 
[03:14:30]  Rape kit in crawl space in the morning.  I want to be rape kit in crawl space.  Rape kit in crawl space.  Morning.  How you doing there, rape kit?  We're trying to get our radio names to be rape kit in crawl space.  Yeah, Steve, I guess, produced another one.  A cool, wackier name than just opening an Anthony.  It's almost done.  He's got one that he's going to bring in a few minutes.  Steve, it's a wonderful one. 
[03:15:00]  And we're looking for the listeners to send in their, uh, entries.  Wacky, ridiculous morning show, uh, show names.  Hey, can I plug, um, laugh.com?  I'm selling my record of boring as log.  Otto and George are boring as log.  No, I don't think you can.  No?  No.  We prefer you didn't.  Yeah.  Okay.  L-A-F-F?  Or L-A-U-G-H?  Seriously.  Laugh.  Uh, I think it's L-A-U-G-H.  Carlin partially owns that, I think.  Yeah.  Uh, laugh.com.  It's a great comic site.  Very cool.  And, um, you're on there, Otto?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, my album's on there. 
[03:15:30]  Um, Marshall Burrell, who's Milton Burrell's nephew, is the guy I talk to there.  He's one of the guys that runs it.  He called me to actually sell my CD there.  He's supposedly a good guy.  As far as I know, I heard Carlin's having a heart, uh, procedure.  He's having a valve replacement.  He's not, he's very unhealthy right now.  That's all right.  He'll be fine.  Yeah.  I hope.  Yeah, he's a tough guy.  You know how it is.  I did tough crowd with him.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  You know, like Walter Boy or something?  Yeah.  That was cool.  All right.  You know, guys like George and myself, when we just do TV together, what?  Enough.  Comedians in the same ilk? 
[03:16:00]  Enough.  We had George Carlin on our radio show once.  That's cool.  I just did work.  We had a terrific time with him.  Sacked on the couch, two equals.  We were, uh, we were stupefied that day.  Oh, yeah, that was George Kalfa.  Hey, uh, Katie Couric, we'll do some of her, uh, just while you're on that.  Let's do that in just a few minutes here.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  This is what it's all about.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  Oh, I love this.  It's crazy.  It's crazy. 
[03:16:30]  Wow.  He chose 36 double B.  He chose 36 double D's.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D's.  He chose 36 double D's.  Oh, wow.  He just looks hurt now.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.  He just looks hurt now anywhere.  With the Mound Wednesday.  Show flash.  Show flash.  Hey, I'm all for it.  Show flash.  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  With the Mound Wednesday. 
[03:17:00]  The night that's dressed.  Hey.  This is what it's all about.  With the Mound Wednesday.  Oh, I love this.  Show.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  What it's all about.  What it's all about.  What it's all about.  Oh, wow.  Whip them fuckers out. 
[03:17:30]  This is fantastic.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's why we call it wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Well, we call it wow.  Hey.  Talk about the boobies.  That's why we call it wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Pick your frog and get it off now.  That's why we call it wow.  That's why we call them wow.  Wow. 
[03:18:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  There is no you  There is only me 
[03:18:30]  There is no you  There is only me  There is no fucking you  There is only me  Is there?  There is no fucking you  There is only me.  I'm like, really?  Otto.  Otto.  Otto and George in the studio.  Bananas, Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday night.  Some of the biggest laughs ever.  Thank you.  Was when I saw Otto and George.  Yeah, I'd have to say Otto is probably maybe laugh harder than any other cover. 
[03:19:00]  Used to watch him at Fast Eddie's in Huntington.  Yeah, that was a long time ago, wasn't that, man?  Now Fast Eddie's doing like magic in my brother's restaurant.  Is he?  Up the street.  We could probably get you at my brother's restaurant.  We might have to talk.  With the bad wig at Fast Eddie's?  Well, yeah.  Chef Salad on his head?  Well, we don't.  Filthy animal with no talent.  Chef Salad on his head.  He's a really nice guy.  But my sister married his son, right?  And so it's okay. 
[03:19:30]  And I've known him probably 15 years now.  And we just don't acknowledge the hairpiece.  Oh, yeah?  We just all make believe it's not on his head.  Oh, God.  Just make believe it's not there.  Nice hat.  Nice hair hat.  Do you think it's a wig, really?  No.  Oh, my God.  It's like...  Well, whatever.  Shit.  But we got a restaurant, right?  Welcome to the studio.  Right up the street from there.  Are you guys having fun?  These guys gave a lot of money to the Dennis Leary thing.  How much money did you give? 
[03:20:00]  For this particular event?  How about a mic?  $30,000.  That's so nice.  Wow.  You guys paid $30,000 to come see us?  Yeah.  Well, I love a burning orphanage, though.  What made you do that?  Not that we're not happy.  It's charitable.  It's charitable.  Nice.  Tax deductible.  When did you realize you weren't going to get your money?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When did it hit you over there?  Was it over there?  When you realized...  At the FM?  We're having a lot of fun, right, Thomas? 
[03:20:30]  I am.  Are you a big fan, Thomas, of the show?  Yeah.  Is it odd that your mom's here and all this filthy...  No.  She's heard worse.  She says worse.  Oh, nice.  She a cougar?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, a cougar.  That was great.  Mom, you're a cougar?  Yes, I am.  Yeah, out on the prowl?  I'm four generations Greenwich Village.  What does that mean?  So I grew up on the streets.  Oh.  I did not know that.  My mouth is filthier than yours, probably.  Greenwich Village in New York?  Yep. 
[03:21:00]  Not the Connecticut Greenwich Village.  No.  That's Greenwich.  I'm not a Greenwich.  Worlds apart.  I know.  Big difference.  Well, you guys have a lot of money, then, if you're spending $30,000 on this crap.  Well, actually, we're commodities traders, and we wanted to invite you to come down on  the trading floor and ring the opening bell if you want.  Fuck bellies.  We walked around there once.  Those guys are...  They're awesome.  Would you ring the opening bell?  That'd be great.  There's guys and girls.  You ignorant nigga!  There's guys and girls. 
[03:21:30]  So I think you guys should go ring the bell.  Commodities, though.  Yep.  Commodities.  My husband trades crude oil, and I trade gold.  Oh, so you're both making some money these days.  Depends.  How much are you guys worth?  A little bit.  How much are you guys worth?  They got to be worth $150,000 a year between them.  Jim could be a little more than that.  Perhaps.  I couldn't say.  The IRS will be listening.  Yeah, these guys are just dripping money, you can tell.  $30,000 to see this mess.  What do you think?  Gold topped out or what?  Gold's not topped out?  $900.  $900,000 you're looking at? 
[03:22:00]  Absolutely.  Jesus Christ.  And what about oil?  Freak straight lines.  What about oil?  It depends on what day it is.  I remember I could have bought Krugerrands for like $150.  He's put stock in Billy Beer.  Nothing, nothing.  Oh, he's laughing.  Billy Beer.  You got it.  Thank you.  Like a nice 1976 joke.  A cunt.  A cunt.  By the way, we do take pictures after the show for $1,000 apiece. 
[03:22:30]  Cash only.  Cash only.  That's right.  Where did that money go to?  Iraq, collect the money.  Quickly.  The money that we paid to come to you guys?  The Dennis Leary Firefighter Foundation?  Yeah, okay.  Actually, that's a great cause.  It benefits, yeah.  So it's not like they're paying to see us.  They gave to a good charity.  I almost have to step out of character.  Oh, no.  I might have to because it is a great cause.  Well, it was a silent auction and this is what we bid on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How did it make you feel when you realized you were the only two that bid on this and you could have had it for $200? 
[03:23:00]  Doesn't that suck?  Actually, a lot of people bid on it.  Did they?  Yeah.  The foundation really does great work.  Mom's not messing around.  Uh-uh.  She can hang with us.  I can tell you.  I can tell you.  Am I saying, Greg, are you going to have to?  Nah, I decided I'll stay in character.  You're going to stay as Opie?  Yeah.  No, go for it.  I thought Greg Hughes was going to have to make a statement.  The actor Greg Hughes that plays Opie on the radio.  He only breaks out a character every once in a while.  Every so often.  That's right.  Very special occasion.  That's right.  30K.  He can't get rid of it in like fucking barnacles. 
[03:23:30]  I know.  It's like 30 large.  We're stuck with him until 11.  We should be serious though.  You're a nigga.  The guy who plays James Norton's going to step out of character.  Oh, wow.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That's my bit.  No, don't take my bit.  He's totally stealing your bit.  I only got a couple bits.  I would have a lot more, but you take all of them.  Look.  I invented Liddy.  I'll settle the whole thing as Anthony Cumia. 
[03:24:00]  I'll settle the whole thing.  No, it's my bit.  I already gave up the Samantha bit.  All right.  Speaking of giving up a bit, I gave up a bit of my pussy last night.  I love that bit.  That used to be my bit.  I made that up.  No, it's my bit.  God, what year was that?  You did it a couple years ago.  Yeah.  Actually, I got a brother screaming at the radio right now because I took it from him.  I want to throw a lawn dart at the three-armed chink baby while he's playing the fucking  accordion.  Goddamn fucking mutant. 
[03:24:30]  George, it was just on the TV again.  You can't get him.  You can't stop looking.  The three-armed chink baby.  No, what's great about Otto and George?  He insists on taking the puppet on the air.  Yeah.  It's like you're not in front of a comedy club.  No.  It doesn't matter.  The one who's still in the talking.  Cunt.  All right.  Well, here it is.  Is Steve going to explain this?  Yeah.  Rape kit and crawl space sweeper made by Steve. 
[03:25:00]  We're looking for more of these.  Steve, you made this?  Was it set in?  And it features Dennis the Rapist.  Is this a new character?  That might be the new one.  Oh, no.  Who is it?  Who did it?  What?  No, no, no.  Who's the new character?  No, there's no actual voice to this character, Dennis.  Thank God.  I was just trying to create a disconnect in between.  Kind of like a third mic type of guy?  Yeah, a third mic type of guy.  Travis actually voiced the woman in the...  Of course he did.  As he should have.  Of course he did.  What's so odd about that method actor? 
[03:25:30]  Nothing at all.  I couldn't get anybody else to do it, so...  All right, let's listen to this piece of production by Steve.  I had a lovely time tonight.  Thank you so much, Dennis.  Maybe we could...  All right, you know...  Travis!  Don't you guys have a pitch transposer you could use or something?  Yeah, yeah, we do.  I'd rather just use it as is.  Oh, my God. 
[03:26:00]  I'm a good girl.  I'm a good girl.  Can you do the voice?  Because I can't put that voice in.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, I want to close my eyes.  Do a little of it.  Let's all close our eyes.  And then you have to look towards this lovely mother and son and do that...  Yes.  These lovely people.  Welcome them here and thank them.  As the woman.  As the girl.  All right, close your eyes, everybody.  So you can feel like it's the real thing.  Okay.  Thank you for coming today.  I hope you have a lovely time. 
[03:26:30]  My God, you're so creepy.  All right, knock off the steady Davis bit and get me an omelet.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Show me with your mouth.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  Well, here it is.  Let's start over.  I had a lovely time tonight.  Thank you so much, Dennis. 
[03:27:00]  Maybe we could do this again sometime?  Dennis, stop!  No, Dennis!  No, Dennis!  Of course.  Rape Kid in Crawl Space.  Mornings.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course.  That has Steve written all over it. 
[03:27:30]  Of course it does.  Spelled a beating.  That is not...  It's duct tape.  It's been a year since I have done something that's misogynistic and brutal.  That's a good one.  I might unload it on that one.  The beginning of that with the bad Miss Piggy is just fantastic.  Thank you.  I think you were listening to the real Muppet.  He does these impersonations.  Maybe we shouldn't play that.  There's a faggot in your building! 
[03:28:00]  Maybe that's a one and done.  I know you got a male to female plug-in on that.  You just enjoy listening to Travis talk about that.  I really do.  I bet he offered to use it and Travis was like, no, no, this is good.  No, no.  I want you to do this.  That's beautiful.  Okay, terrific.  Katie Couric saying goodbye.  I want more of those.  Okay.  Yeah, that's Travis' new character.  Absolutely. 
[03:28:30]  It's more manly than his regular one.  He's going to shadow box and get ready.  Katie said goodbye today on the Today Show.  Thank God.  Enough.  Here's her analogy that you came up with.  I just want to quickly say, you know, I've been racking my brains, my small brains,  trying to figure out how to sum up 15 years in just a minute or two.  But the word I keep coming back to is gratitude.  It was once said that feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present 
[03:29:00]  and not giving it.  You know, I never dreamed I would see a rainbow over Victoria Falls, walk silently among the  crosses above the beaches of Normandy, see the blue mountains of Australia, or get a  tour of 10 Downing Street from Tony Blair.  And that's just a small sampling of what I'm grateful for.  And the people I've worked with, the Today Show staff scurries around every day like elves  on Christmas Eve.  And there are no small contributions to this show.  They're not simply co-workers to all of us.  They're lifelong friends.  And I love them, not just for what they do, all of you guys, but for the people they 
[03:29:30]  are.  Dreck and drivel.  Just what pseudo poetic nonsense.  Yeah.  She's probably like Joseph Mengele when she's not on the camera.  Yeah.  She's probably yelling at us.  This is horrible.  Bitch.  Having gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a gift in that gift.  No.  I'd bite her nose off and spit it in her face. 
[03:30:00]  Goddamn rich cunt.  That's Jeff Goldblum.  Yes.  From Death Wish.  It's from The Fly.  Where did you find that?  Goddamn rich cunt.  Yeah, that's from Death Wish.  I know.  I was kidding.  But where'd you get that?  Yeah, that's it from Independence Day.  Oh, that's fucking great.  I guess the fan, I love that one.  Oh, that is so funny.  Goddamn rich cunt.  That's my favorite thing he's ever done. 
[03:30:30]  He's so angry.  By the way, they're doing these crazy montages today.  Did they do the wowing on the Today Show as part of that?  Oh, I don't think they would have included that.  They didn't go there?  Goddamn rich cunt.  Oh, man.  A little more Katie.  Katie says bye to Matlow.  Oh, very emotional moment.  Now, I know I'll never have a partner like you again because I'll never be working with a partner again.  I am scripted. 
[03:31:00]  I ruined it for everyone.  But truly, you have just been an extraordinary colleague, a wonderful friend.  You are fast and funny.  And beneath this well-dressed exterior lies a huge and loving heart.  And I'm going to miss you so much.  I know I'll never have this much fun.  You're a little deuce bag.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time. 
[03:31:30]  Put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put, put.  Hello, exactly.  We have Matt's response.  Do you use your tongue, Bertier, in a $20 hole?  Actually, I got Matt's response right here, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  Here's Katie's final words.  We're tanks for nothing.  Oh, please, please play Katie and play that clip over her. 
[03:32:00]  Please.  Oh, buddy, shut up, Rich.  I hate you.  I hate you.  And I guess Matt started getting a little choked up.  So, uh.  Great mockingness.  So much fun.  You can act like a man.  What's allowed to do?  I actually, uh, got some Matt.  Al Roker had to.  Someone said it was Travis when he was cutting that last promo.  Oh, I got some Matt Lauer audio over here if you'd like to hear it.  Yeah, okay.  Hello, folk face. 
[03:32:30]  Hmm.  Well, um.  It's a very, very sad day over there.  Yeah.  What do they got?  Katie.  Who's taking her place?  Uh, Meredith.  Meredith.  Vieira.  Vieira.  And then Matt.  Yeah.  And, uh.  And, um.  Al Roker's still going to throw feces at people.  Al thought he was getting the promotion.  Like, Al thought he was going to be the guy and they were going to get another sidekick  and he was a little upset.  Yeah.  You don't want to hire any niggas, that's all. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a pretty.  God damn rich punk.  No.  No.  It's not funny.  You guys have to stop.  Oh, come on.  Stop.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:33:30]  Oh.  Oh, that's going to make me happy all day.  Shut up.  Shut up.  God damn rich punk.  Oh, come on.  The funniest thing ever.  He's so angry.  Yeah, he's really angry.  Because she's wealthy.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  I thought that Jim's going to explain it.  He's so angry.  Because she's wealthy.  Anthony, I don't think you really mean that.  Yes, I do. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, Anthony.  Oh, God damn.  That is a trick.  I just wanted to be part of the group.  Oh, my chest.  That's delightful.  You know, you guys always go too far.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  We got any more, Kate?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, here we go.  Here's the big bye to Al Roker and, and, and, and, uh, what, Carrie, I guess, right?  And, Al, you amaze me every day with your enthusiasm and your ability to connect with everyone outside and your light-filled joie de vivre, which I think is only matched by your extraordinary depth. 
[03:34:30]  Truly.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  God damn rich cut.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  And Al.  Al actually did have something to say after her touching words. 
[03:35:00]  God damn rich cut.  I've asked you to please not use that word around me.  Is that so difficult?  All right, all right, all right.  Here's where I draw the line.  Sorry, I'm sorry.  You know, you sound just like my ex-husband.  Oh, that's funny shit.  Oh, you know you're going to go to hell for this.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Al said that to her.  Now, guys, let's not make fun of people. 
[03:35:30]  As she was leaving.  Oh, shit.  All right, back to the audio.  Say goodbye to Al and Anne.  Very depth, truly.  Thank you.  And, Anne, I think your passion for what you do and your genuine concern for people and colleges.  God damn rich cut.  All of that.  This is the best job in the world.  I'll never not laugh at that.  Oh, God. 
[03:36:00]  You guys have to stop.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  He's so good.  He's such a heated, rage-filled clip.  Yeah.  Oh, it just goes from zero to 60 immediately.  He gets funnier.  He's pummeling her with a blackjack in the face while he's saying that.  He is, right?  Yeah.  God damn rich cunt.  Hope Lang.  I'm so sorry. 
[03:36:30]  I'm just trying to help, guys.  You can hear like he's almost spitting the tea out.  Oh, God damn rich cunt.  Great, great, great rage.  Funny shit.  Matt Lauer.  Go ahead, go on, leave.  Leave, I'll pardon you.  I'll pardon you.  I'll pardon you.  I'm crying.  And causes, all of that have inspired me so much.  You know, I started 15 years ago with a producer named Jeff Zucker. 
[03:37:00]  By the way, whatever happened to that guy?  Now, we have often talked, and Jeff and I both say that this is, in fact, the best job in all of television.  And what a privilege it's been for me to hold this post for almost a third of my life.  And I couldn't have done that without all my friends you are in the viewing audience who have been with me through the years.  I started this run with Jeff, and I end it in the able hands of our executive producer, Jim Bell, and his entire team.  And I know this program will be one I'm proud of long after I'm gone and I'm starting to sound like an ego louser. 
[03:37:30]  Shut up!  Well, she sounds very sincere, and she's just thanking everybody. 
[03:38:00]  15 years, what?  Is that it?  Here's Matt's reply.  Matt's reply.  The thing I'll remember most, Kimmy, and what I cherish most of all, and I want the people at home to know, is, boy, have we laughed.  We have laughed on the air and off the air every day, day in and day out.  Sometimes I'm home on the weekends, and I just burst out laughing because of something you've said or you've done during the show.  I need to get a hobby.  I know, but everything from giggles to belly laughs. 
[03:38:30]  And so aside from the fact that you are the perfect journalistic partner, and aside from the fact that at this stage we can complete each other's sentences, which is a little scary, I thank you for the laughs.  And, you know, people talk about chemistry with us.  I never have been able to define it, but on your last day, I just want you to know that from my end, it comes from great love and respect.  And I'm going to miss you.  Speaking of chemistry, kiss me, baby.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[03:39:00]  Okay.  I need a moment.  I need too.  So, Ann, can you give us a moment?  I can give you a moment.  Thanks so much.  It was really sweet to hear all that.  I will have to say, though.  In the news, I've got to turn now, make that hard turn, and to tell you about the news.  It's a panic.  I'm breaking your balls, and you're right away, you're getting fucking fed.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  He's just kidding a little fucking manners.  Ann Curry, the robot at the end of that.  Well, I've got to now do the news. 
[03:39:30]  That's so funny.  God, I'm a linda.  Jesus.  All right.  That was very touching.  So happy.  And on a final note.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Oh, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  He's so angry.  It's just...  I saw that movie, too, recently. 
[03:40:00]  And I was like, is that Jeff Goldblum?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  He is an angry man.  Great movie.  Fucking great.  Yeah.  We could play that.  I like the other one, too.  Which one is...  What do you use this for?  We're jacking off.  10 to midnight.  Is that 10 to midnight?  It wasn't one of the...  Yeah.  We got Warren.  Yeah.  Running naked down the street.  I'll be back.  Oh, no, you won't.  Yeah.  Great cheeks, that guy.  What a physique on him.  Hey, we got Matt Lauer on the Tonight Show. 
[03:40:30]  Talking about the wowing that happened on the Today Show.  Oh.  This is all about us.  And of course, it is not happy.  Always.  And he had to tell Jay Leno how upset he was.  He should have put two rolls of quarters in a sock and smashed her in the face.  If he was that upset.  How about the woman that took his shirt off in the line?  Which I hear you've had a little fun with.  We had a lot of fun with it.  Did that shock you?  Well, you know what it was?  We were outside.  And if you've seen the 8.30 in the show every morning, the camera pans the crowd outside.  And what I do is, since I can't see where the camera is sometimes, I look at the monitor. 
[03:41:00]  And I'm standing there.  It happened to be with Ann Curry.  Katie was in Philadelphia at the time.  And I'm looking at the monitor.  And I see the people go by.  And normally, you know, hi, mom.  Hey, Kansas.  Go Jayhawks.  And all of a sudden, the camera goes by.  And this woman looks at the camera and goes.  And my first thought was it was one of those kind of like plastic pieces that you wear  on Halloween, you know, that they weren't real.  They might have been, yeah, when you think about it.  And then after like 45 seconds of staring at it, I said, you know, those are real.  And, you know, she had written the word wow on her stomach, which apparently is, you 
[03:41:30]  know, W.O.W. stands for the stupid radio station promotion in New York called Whip Them  Out Wednesdays.  And so she whipped them out.  Well, it's not a stupid promotion anymore.  They just got a lot of publicity.  I think it actually said powwow, but gravity had covered the top word.  But what's weird about it is, think about this lady.  At some point during her day, that day, she had to get in front of a mirror and say, yeah,  these are ready for national television. 
[03:42:00]  And I've got to be honest with you, speak as one boob man to another, these were not  that great.  I mean, I've seen a lot better boobs than these.  And yet she exposes them on a morning show.  But you know what's good in what, six years of having the outdoor studio?  I think that's the first, there was one other little weird thing, but that's the first  time anyone has, you know, gone.  Don't say that now.  But you know, we have, most of the people are great.  They're very wholesome people.  There you go.  Wholesome people, are they?  Don't say that now.  And his joke wasn't accurate.  That it said powwow, but gravity took care of the pow part. 
[03:42:30]  Because then you just see pow.  No, because then you just see wow.  He's saying that the pow got covered.  Oh, I got it.  But she actually had great tits, though.  But you don't read from bottom up?  Well, he was saying it'd be top, pow, and then wow under it, and pow got covered.  Oh, on her belly.  It's like her belly's covered.  It's written on her belly.  That's what I'm thinking.  But why would pow be written on her?  It's written on her belly's so low that pow gets covered.  Oh, all right, all right, all right.  Covered.  I guess he was accurate on that.  Walk me through that joke one more time, you fucking asshole.  Otto's just so annoyed. 
[03:43:00]  We get punch drunk at this time of the morning, Otto.  Yeah.  You got to understand, we've been on the radio for like five hours.  All right, Otto and George, Bananas, Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday.  It's going to be two great shows.  Also, MySpace, Otto and George, right?  Yeah, all my dates are there.  Come out and see me.  It's going to be cool.  Will you be my MySpace friend?  We're going to do Liz Taylor and then we're going to get out of here.  Yeah, little Liz Taylor.  I guess she was on Larry King?  Well, she had to because they're saying she's dying and that she has Alzheimer's and all  that.  So she went on Larry King to show that she's just fine. 
[03:43:30]  Got it.  Talked about Michael Jackson.  Did she call Larry Johnny?  I still had enough of this broad.  Well, you can't die in.  We'll get into it.  All right.  We'll get into it next.  How's that sound?  All right.  I don't have to change my template.  Wow across America.  True tales from the road.  Real evil.  Real stories.  Real boo.  Hey, O&A.  This is Kentucky Ranger.  I'm a trucker.  I put my Wow on the back of my trailer. 
[03:44:00]  It's 6 o'clock this morning.  It's 7 a.m.  I'm traveling west on the BG Parkway, heading to Lebanon, Kentucky.  This little Audi sports car come up around me.  I can see some activity in the passenger seat.  I figured a gal was taking her bra off.  She come up around the truck.  When they got up next to me, she flashed me.  Dude, this is Matt from Cleveland.  I'm going to tell you about the wow I had yesterday.  I work for a major company in Cleveland. 
[03:44:30]  The secretary calls me in her office and says, you know what day it is?  It's Wednesday.  God damn it.  Those are some nice titties.  I got wowed on Sunday.  I'm in the middle of New Mexico.  These murky little boobies were awesome.  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony wow line.  866-WOW-ME-05.  And if you need a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  Very proud of my big tip.  We'll be right back. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, Jackson.  What?  I know.  The music gets really loud sometimes. 
[03:45:30]  Word up.  Deaf fan.  Look at Faggot Travis laughing at deaf fan.  What's that?  What's that?  What is that?  It's not the book.  I've written a letter.  Did we get it back?  Ben said he was going to get it that day.  I thought we were supposed to have the book obits already.  Hundreds and hundreds of hours of our old shows are being handed over to us, and we're 
[03:46:00]  going to throw them on XM.  It's the holy grail.  And we didn't have to pay anything for them.  No.  We get them for free.  Where is it?  It's arriving at the other building.  It had to be signed out by the CBS lawyers.  Another great thing that came about because of this deal we made.  We'll have it actually when we go back over there today.  We're going to be adding hundreds and hundreds of hours of Opie and Anthony material from our  old show.  Yep.  Hundreds and hundreds of hours.  And there's a lot of people out there that have never heard any of it. 
[03:46:30]  So we're very excited.  We want to actually see the book obits for the first time in like four years.  Before it was just two CDs.  All right.  We lost the rest.  Knowing lawyers, it's going to be missing a ton of them.  But hopefully we'll get enough back that it'll be worth it for us.  All right.  Liz Taylor talking about Michael Jackson on Larry King last night.  The rag magazines and all the supermarkets.  Very concerned that Liz Taylor might have Alzheimer's.  Who is him?  She's dying.  So she decided to make an appearance on Larry King last night to dispel. 
[03:47:00]  Sure.  To dispel.  Dispel.  To dispel the rumors.  Right.  Yeah.  What?  That she's thin?  I'm starting a rumor.  I'm actually thin.  Well, Sam's cheating, motherfucker.  Otto, you've had a fine appearance today, by the way.  I got to tell you.  Oh, thanks.  All right.  Here it is.  Liz Taylor and Larry King.  Have you spoken to him recently?  Yes, I have. 
[03:47:30]  How's he doing?  He's in Webb.  He sounds very happy.  Where is he?  At the moment, I think he's in London.  But he was in Tokyo recently and then London.  But he lives in Bahrain.  Right.  What did you think of the charges against him?  I've never been so angry in my life.  I almost didn't buy a necklace that day.  San Diego, do you have a question for this goddamn rich cunt?  Goddamn rich cunt! 
[03:48:00]  Oh, is she awful.  She's so angry.  She obviously has Alzheimer's.  She's probably just talking to a picture on the wall in her mansion in Beverly Hills.  How about when Richard Burton was drunk and punching him in the cheekbone?  Did that kind of...  Did that make you angry?  That's so...  Two weeks.  Does that ring a bell?  Two weeks.  Two weeks from total recall.  It is, Liz Taylor.  Two weeks from Fatcher.  But didn't you think, Elizabeth, or Dame Elizabeth, I'm sorry, that it would look strange to people to have someone who's in his 40s spending a night with children? 
[03:48:30]  I mean, just off the face of it.  All right.  I'll answer that.  Because I've been there.  When his nephews were there, and we all were in the bed watching television, there was nothing abnormal about it.  There was no touchy feeling going on.  We laughed like children. 
[03:49:00]  And we watched a lot of Walt Disney.  Laughed like children and molested children.  There was nothing odd about it.  Nothing odd about it.  About it.  She sounds all hammered.  They're being between the two old people, like that midnight cowboy scene.  Here, lover.  Here, go see the movies.  Sort of laughing and drinking whiskey.  Laying in bed with that big black unshaven twat.  Just like a big triangle.  The kid's using it as a pillow.  A fat old lady with a cancer wig and a fucking, like, a half a black guy who's trying to finger your ass under the covers. 
[03:49:30]  At some park he's got over there.  Neverland.  Lovely for a bunch of little nephews with blonde hair.  Neverland.  You're never going to forget what happened to you here.  Yeah, I know.  We'll never remember it without professional help.  Will we come back to the U.S.?  She answers that very question.  So you think they were out after him?  I think.  The authorities and the like.  I think the paparazzi started.  I'm not the paparazzi, the press. 
[03:50:00]  Excuse me, may I blow my nose?  You may.  Thank you.  It's called human.  Well, I'm not.  Even Elizabeth Taylor blows her nose.  Well, I know she takes her shoe off and starts picking her asshole.  She's got Alzheimer's.  Mind if I blow my nose?  Mind if she blows her nose and her weight goes flying?  Yeah.  A piece of her brain stem comes out in the tissue.  Blows a construction work, a snot rocket on his desk.  That's what I'd like to see.  That's the way we do it. 
[03:50:30]  Is he going to come back to working?  I don't think so.  Except maybe in Europe.  You don't think he'll ever live in the United States again?  Well, really, why should he?  Yeah.  He's been treated like dirt here.  Who are they talking about?  Soupy sales?  They lost me.  Can you believe you've been treated like dirt? 
[03:51:00]  The country's fucking treated him bad.  She pays $20 million or whatever to shut some family up.  The country forgives him and still buys his albums.  He's treated terribly.  Treated awfully.  Everywhere he goes, there are crowds of fans.  Do you know what I'd love to say to her?  Overmedicated fucking manatee.  Oh, and she does sound a little off.  She sounds way off.  Blowing her nose.  If I blow my nose, half her brain stem comes out. 
[03:51:30]  I said that.  Did you?  Yes.  I'm going to love hearing the replay.  I love when I say the same thing Jimmy said.  I said the brain stem comes out in the tissue.  I suck.  It's like Rowan and Rowan.  He stinks and I don't like him.  Oh, Jimmy, I'm not that bad.  Snot rocket.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  I was thinking.  You know how we get.  Yeah.  I'm thinking of something. 
[03:52:00]  Jimmy's thinking of something.  He says it.  I don't listen.  And then Dice does my nursery rhymes.  Hickory dickory dog.  You rich cunt.  Yeah, I've heard that one, man.  Dice taking the nursery rhymes from Otto.  Yeah.  He's mad at us for some reason.  Really?  Because I guess we treat him bad somewhere along the way.  I don't know.  Well, you got too many listeners.  You got too many listeners now. 
[03:52:30]  I like going on a show with like eight people.  Because I get scared.  Oh.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Now he's buddy-buddy with Howard.  It's like the crap he would tell us about Howard.  I never understood.  On air, off air, on the phone when he would call me and we'd talk for two to three hours a night.  Of course, he would talk for two hours and 45 minutes and I would talk for 15.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I was stupid enough to stay on the line.  Right.  But now he hates us for some reason.  We don't even know why. 
[03:53:00]  He hates us.  And honestly, we don't even care in the end.  He's a failed acting career.  Well, I never understood the parameters about doing the one show or the other.  I mean, who gets mad if you do what?  I mean-  That was a Howard thing.  We could care less.  Yeah, we didn't care.  That was a Howard thing.  We had guys that were doing both shows.  We could care less.  Colin has still done Howard's show.  Yeah.  Colin would go on there.  Right.  And that's-  I love Colin when he comes on here.  You got no problem.  You do what you do.  So, but yeah, there was always a problem over there that no one was allowed to do this  show and then do that show.  That's fucking ridiculous.  We never cared. 
[03:53:30]  It really is.  We knew we got some great things out of our guests.  We don't want people going over there.  If they go over there and start bashing us and then expect something-  Well, obviously, that's not-  Yeah, that ain't going to work.  But we understand, you know, you guys got to make a living.  Of course.  That's stupid.  Of course.  Well, we are stupid.  We're incredibly stupid.  But, you know, we understand.  That was another dumb Howard thing, the paranoid asshole.  Yeah.  Because he knew we did a better job with a lot of those guests.  Yeah.  A lot of those guys.  Absolutely.  Because we let you guys be funny on our show.  Yeah.  I'd like to welcome Dice to the show. 
[03:54:00]  I hope you brought a DeLorean because I want to go back to 1986.  When we were both popular.  Who-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Jackass.  Stop it.  It's now Andrew Dice Gay.  Yeah.  Andrew Dice Gay.  A little cock in the ass never hurt no one.  All right?  Do we get some-  Oh!  Do we get some gay music for Andrew Dice Gay today?  I like why a man can't change over the years. 
[03:54:30]  I used to talk about the broads all the time.  Remember?  I sure do.  Do you remember?  I sure do.  The time when I used to say, I'm standing on line at a bank, and I got my tongue up this  chick's ass, and everyone would laugh.  That's a classic Dice line.  It's classic.  Now it goes more like this.  All right.  Hit it.  So I'm standing on line at the fag bar, and I got this guy's cock in my mouth, and he  shoots a load of cum into my mouth, and I go, thank you. 
[03:55:00]  Now can you fuck me in the air?  Oh, I can dance.  I can jive.  Yeah, I'm having the time of my life.  Oh!  See that cock?  Stick it up your ass.  Look at Dice the Fag.  You hear me?  I fuck you now.  His cum, it was so dick. 
[03:55:30]  It was like chowder.  Hard to swallow, yet pleasurable.  You hear me?  I hear you, Dice.  Back when men were faggots.  Back in the old days.  I love Abba.  I like the village people.  Those are fun fags.  You got some village people.  Yeah, I love this one.  Oh! 
[03:56:00]  Oh!  Everybody, young man, stick it right in my ass.  Young man.  There's no need to feel down.  Dice, any thoughts about Brokeback Mountain?  I love that movie.  There's cowboys who were rugged, right?  Yeah.  Yet they're fucking faggots.  They're sucking cock, ass fucking.  Yet they go to town and have some beers like men.  Why can't men be like men like that there? 
[03:56:30]  But they're ostracized.  Or fucking an ostrich, one or the other.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  It's fun to know that Dice is gay.  D-I-C-E gay.  Everybody, how do you make a D?  With the arms.  I'm a fucking faggot.  D-I-C is gay.  I'm gay. 
[03:57:00]  I love it.  It's raining men.  Can you pull that out of your ass?  To make room for my cock.  Oh!  Oh!  We hear you.  I blow you now.  It's raining fags.  I want to go out when it's raining men, right?  Pull down my drawers.  Do a handstand with no fucking umbrella.  It's raining men.  Chism in my ass. 
[03:57:30]  Ugh, gosh!  Angel Dice gay.  Did we drill this into the ground enough?  I don't think so.  It makes me laugh.  It's almost like old school.  It makes me very happy.  All right.  So I'm with this guy.  I shouldn't tell a joke while I'm sucking cock. 
[03:58:00]  It's something new I've got to learn from being a fag.  Joke, then suck the cock, then joke.  You do it at the same time.  You're hickory dickory duck.  The cum interferes with the punchline.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Little Miss Muffet sat on the top at eating.  A cursing way.  Right.  Along came a spider. 
[03:58:30]  Another face full of cum ruined my fucking joke.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Hilarious.  One more please.  One more please.  Great gift for mimicry.  One more please.  Anthony has lost his mind.  Germaphobus lost his mind.  He's got gloves so it's all over his shirt.  What's the matter with you?  I got it.  It's new to me. 
[03:59:00]  Look, you don't understand.  All right.  Let's...  I usually would tell jokes.  Right, right.  And just leave.  Yeah.  But now that I'm such a fucking faggot, I need cock in my mouth all the time.  Right.  So when I tell the jokes, it's, oh, Mother Hubbard.  I went to the cupboard to get her old dog a bone.  I got more cum in my face. 
[03:59:30]  I spent over.  I almost took over.  He's a good one.  Classic.  Wow.  Holy shit.  He's lost his fucking mind.  The last time I injured myself, I slammed the bottle into my lip and I'm bleeding. 
[04:00:00]  You grew blood.  All right.  I'm bleeding for my craft, dude.  They're fucking begging for more, though.  They're begging.  Dude, look.  They're begging for more.  I slammed the bottle into my lip and I'm bleeding.  You were a little too eager for that.  I want to cock.  I need it.  I'm yearning.  I gotta have it.  Oh.  You lost your mind today. 
[04:00:30]  I'm crying.  Jack and Jill went up the hill.  Both with a buck and a quarter.  Right.  Jack and...  I love the cock.  What can I say?  I love the cock.  Fucking sorry.  I'm too sexy for my pants. 
[04:01:00]  Too sexy for my pants.  I'll take them off.  Suck my cock.  I am too sexy for me.  Too sexy for me.  Too sexy for this joke.  Too sexy for this joke.  Watch, I'll choke. 
[04:01:30]  Oh.  Jesus Christ, I love cock.  Oh.  It doesn't even work anymore.  You're ringing out the...  My mic is soaked.  I got a fat lip.  I'm bleeding.  And I gotta go to a Snacker 2 meeting.  Oh, my God.  Anthony really is bleeding. 
[04:02:00]  He's got a fat lip.  He's got a fat lip and I'm bleeding.  I got a club soda and spit all over the front of his shirt.  It's all over the counter.  I'm soaked.  It's like I wet my pants.  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  Please replay this tomorrow.  Please replay this tomorrow.  During the long commercial break.  Well, let Dice do whatever he wants.  Yeah, there you go.  Tom on Long Island.  Tom.  This is the greatest radio ever. 
[04:02:30]  You guys are outrageous.  I love it.  Wow.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Chris in North Carolina.  Chris.  I smashed my lip.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Am I on?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Hey, dude.  Anthony, that's fucking radio gold, man.  You fucking hit it out of the park.  I'm fucking driving my truck.  I'm about to wreck.  Absolutely.  The only thing that could have made that better is if it was a real cock you were grabbing.  Jimmy, come here.  I've never seen Anthony lose his shit like that before. 
[04:03:00]  Wow.  The visual is amazing.  I started, like, puking or something.  I was laughing so hard.  Oh, my God.  White shorts.  Hey, hey.  Goddamn rich cunts.  What's up, white?  Yeah, I just want to let you know that's better than a radio gold.  That's radio platinum.  There you go.  Thank you, my friend.  All right.  Ah, we're going to do all this stuff, but fuck it.  Let's end right there now. 
[04:03:30]  All righty.  We had, like, an update on that stupid horse that broke his leg, but who cares?  We'll get to it tomorrow.  Maybe tomorrow.  I got to ice my lip.  Do we have a number?  I'm an asshole.  Do we have a banana's phone number?  To give it out for Otto?  It's at the Holiday Inn in Hasbrook.  Nah, I don't.  How about a number, Hawk?  You want to look it up online since fucking Otto's not prepared?  We should give out his number.  He wrote down all sorts of stuff.  I know he did.  I want to give out a number so they can call for tickets.  Okay. 
[04:04:00]  Wow.  That was funny.  That was beyond funny.  That was great.  That was beyond funny.  Thank God.  Here's hers.  That's a giant shit.  That was fun.  But I smacked myself.  Does Opie have to mention every fucking day that we're punch drunk at this time of day?  We've been doing radio for, like, five hours now.  Really?  A whole five hours of work a day?  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Starting tomorrow, we do less than five hours a day.  There you go.  Oh, no.  Punishment. 
[04:04:30]  No.  See, because we really are punch drunk, so I don't remember that I'm saying that every  day.  You ass.  What are you doing, Eric?  Wow.  Oh, that's a nutty gig.  Yeah.  Mind your business.  Pathetic little plugs.  Mind your goddamn business.  Don't go over there and look at Otto's paper.  You're right, Dan.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Otto, when are you coming back?  Anytime.  This is great.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, you didn't get to do enough time on the first half of the show, so I'm thinking  you should get back on there soon.  Yeah. 
[04:05:00]  What do you mean?  The ACW?  Yeah, because we had Lizard Man.  That messed up your time, I think.  No, that was fun seeing that.  Oh, man.  It's weird.  Oh, with the fucking stomach pain.  It's weird.  The first half of the show, we only have like two hours and 45 minutes, so it goes by like  that.  Yeah.  That's cool.  All right.  So Otto and George at Bananas Comedy Club.  In Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey.  Call Holiday Inn.  Holiday Inn.  Let me see if...  He's trying.  I know.  He is trying.  I'll fucking yank his hair. 
[04:05:30]  Fuck it.  I'm not getting a door deal.  You know?  Fuck them.  Hey, I like that.  Right on.  But no, the more...  Here's what it is.  The more people that come to see you, the more value they feel they're getting for their  dollar and they'll pay you more...  Scribble the name, the bigot of fame.  Absolutely.  BananasComedyClub.com or call 201-727-1090.  Does that sound familiar?  201-201-727-1090. 
[04:06:00]  Otto and George.  What are you doing?  One show a night?  Holiday Inn.  Yeah, yeah.  One show.  One show.  New Jersey.  Friday and Saturday.  Big eyes.  Big eyes.  They will both show out.  And you can purchase my CD live at the Holiday Inn.  Are you selling them?  Yeah.  Will you sign them?  For cash.  Will you post for photos?  I'm selling them for cash and photos, yeah.  Ooh.  You all right over there, fat lip?  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I'm going to go to this meeting now with a fat lip all bleeding and wet like I wet myself.  Oh, sweetie. 
[04:06:30]  Thank you, too.  God.  You lost your mind.  You're a retard.  That was good.  Let's go to Gary in Tennessee.  Gary.  Yeah.  Hey, Gary.  How do you do, Gary?  Ah, pretty good.  I just want to say, it's past 11 o'clock, and we wouldn't have heard that.  Anthony would be so freaking funny like that.  Oh, thank you.  Don't pee yourself.  You know how hard it wants me to write down all that shit and feed it to him?  Yeah.  We love you, Anthony. 
[04:07:00]  We're up here in New York City with the Jew judges and the nigger police.  And the guinea DAs.  All right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Punch it out, guys.  Not my birthday.  All right.  I guess that's how we end today.  Yeah.  Let's get over there and slap a smile on our face and run through that shit one more time.  Thank you, Bill Hicks, for the greatest comedy line ever.  You know how we should end?  How?  On a word.  Okay. 
[04:07:30]  Orange.  Ugh.  Horrible words.  Orange, you're glad you didn't say banana.  No, but orange.  But we didn't end on orange, because then we talked.  So end on orange, and then we get out of here.  So try it again.  Orange.  It's powerful, right?  Yeah.  But...  Goddamn rich cunt!  That'll do.  Yeah.  Let's do it!  The Opinality Show.  The Opinality Show.  The Opinality Show.  The Opinality Show.  The Opinality Show.  The Opinality Show.
