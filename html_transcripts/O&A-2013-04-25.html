<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, employing consistently vulgar and often misogynistic language throughout.  The show opened with a discussion of People magazine's "Most Beautiful Woman" list, provoking crude jokes about the appearance of celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, Amy Schumer, Jennifer Lawrence, Beyoncé, and Serena Williams.  Significant time was devoted to harshly criticizing a photo of a radio colleague, Nicole "Mashup," alongside Selena Gomez.  The hosts also reacted to a viral video of a child lip-syncing and extensively, and offensively,  critiqued William Hung's American Idol performance.  Further offensive commentary targeted Selena Gomez, the Olsen twins, and Dakota Fanning.  The show also analyzed negative and sexually suggestive Instagram comments on a photo of Nicole.

A significant portion focused on A.J. Clemente, the news anchor who cursed on live television.  Clips were played, and the hosts speculated on his future.  They also enthusiastically, though crudely, reviewed Amy Schumer's "Inside Amy Schumer" show, having attended its premiere.  The broadcast included mentions of several other individuals, including Bob Kelly and Patrice O’Neal, but only Ronda Rousey and George St-Pierre appeared as in-studio guests later in the show.  Upcoming guests Bob Kelly, Ronda Rousey, and George St. Pierre were also mentioned.

The show then delved into the Boston Marathon bombing, questioning inconsistencies in the official narrative, particularly regarding the suspects' weapons and injuries.  A caller, Doug, challenged Anthony's criticism of the Obama administration, sparking a debate about governmental transparency.  The hosts then discussed Anthony Cumia's recent sobriety, his changed demeanor, and his increased consumption of ice cream and candy.  Further topics included Anthony Weiner's political comeback attempts and the ricin case. A caller with vaginal atresia detailed her experiences, leading to a detailed, graphic discussion with a medical professional, Dr. Steve.

A rambling discussion followed, featuring a repeated nonsensical lyric and a segment about the impending birth of one of the hosts' children, including a sexually suggestive anecdote about a doula’s massage.  This transitioned into a studio visit from Ronda Rousey, where they discussed her UFC career, family background, injuries, and the dynamics of female fighters in a male-dominated world.  Rousey even demonstrated an armbar.

A subsequent segment featured George St-Pierre, promoting his book, "The Way of the Fight."  The conversation covered MMA fighting styles, St-Pierre's career, including his childhood bullying, knee surgery, and demanding training regimen.  They debated myths about sex before fights, sleep, the manufactured animosity in promoting fights, and St-Pierre's relationships with other fighters, including Nick Diaz and Ronda Rousey. The segment concluded with discussions of professional wrestling and predictions of upcoming fights.

The final segment focused on The Rock's declining wrestling performance and speculated about a rift between The Rock and Vince McMahon.  Michael Bay's criticisms of The Rock were also discussed.  The show included an anecdote about one of the hosts encountering Mark Wahlberg, a live read for Stephen Singer Jewelers, sarcastic comments about Anthony’s drinking, and mention of Opie's new family life and Snoop Dogg's presence outside the studio. The show concluded with a mention of an upcoming Opie and Anthony bus tour and further discussion of Elvis Presley, including his comeback special and interactions with fans.  The hosts also attempted to resolve a conflict with Nicole.  Andrew Dice Clay’s parenting advice and a segment from “How Much” calculating the number of farts needed to fill a hot air balloon were also included.  The Jersey Shore cast and their financial situations, particularly Vinny's upcoming talk show, were discussed, employing stereotypical descriptions of his family and Staten Island.  The government shutdown's impact on air travel was also discussed, using offensive language to describe politicians.

[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme...  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fleshly.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, wow. Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make the fuck it's there again?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks. 
[00:05:00]  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All right.  Look at that.  Jump right in with both feet.  We were just here.  Yes.  Like moments ago.  Seems like that.  Yeah.  The week seems to be moving along, though.  This one's moving along nicely.  I like the fact that yesterday I was under the false impression that it was Tuesday. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  For a little while.  And it turns out to be Wednesday.  So, when you have that happen, you got the week knocked.  It's Thursday.  Oh, sure.  I thought it was Friday.  Sorry.  It could be Friday.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Who's getting sick around here?  Sniffles.  We're very responsible.  Because I know we can take way more days off than we do.  I know. 
[00:06:00]  At this point, they're not even paying attention to us.  I don't even know if they still work here.  I really don't know.  I don't know who works here.  I don't know who it is.  I just realized you shaved.  Sorry.  Oh.  I saw you last night.  I realized you shaved.  I shaved last night.  We were hanging out the whole night, too.  Oh, really?  It was something that was, like, different.  Like, I knew it, but I just...  We were hanging out the whole night.  I guess I saw it.  And it wasn't a little beard.  It was a big fucking beard.  I was telling Anthony, I shaved and I feel like I lost my chin. 
[00:06:30]  Like, when you grow a beard, it extends your chin.  Your whole face gets extended.  And it gives you, like, a superhero chin.  And then you shave it and you got nothing going on, man.  I feel like I'm missing a piece of my face.  What is this, dude?  Yeah, me and Jimmy and Bob Kelly had a little circle there.  We were hanging out for a while.  Circle jerk would have been nice.  Yeah, it was time to, you know, shave the beard.  I had it for six months.  I recognized it, but I didn't.  Like, I realized you hadn't been here longer than that when... 
[00:07:00]  I started...  When Patrice got sick, you had it.  No, you shaved that one.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, no, I started...  Whatever.  I started growing the beard for Patrice, and then I decided to do it again this year.  I'd never had a beard before Patrice died, really.  Oh, you had shaved...  Okay.  Yeah, I shaved it in between.  But this one lasted about six months.  You don't realize how used to you get somebody in a fucking beard or with facial hair?  Like, when you shaved your mustache or your goatee, it's weird when somebody shaves, even though you've known them shaved before.  I look at old pictures of you with the mustache.  Yeah, that's so weird to look at now. 
[00:07:30]  It's a million years ago now.  And then the goatee, too.  Yeah.  Ah, yes, the many facial hairs.  We were goatee guys for a while.  Oh, we certainly were.  I don't know.  Like a video game character that you get to make.  Yeah.  Like, let me do the hairstyle.  Yeah.  Eyes, not the facial hair.  I'll go with this.  I want to...  I don't know.  I used to like the goatees, but I guess they're really out.  They're out.  Unless you're Louis C.K. making fucking boatloads of money.  It works for him, but most people, they just don't walk around with the goatee anymore. 
[00:08:00]  Once mine started looking like a zebra, it was like, ah, I can't do this anymore.  I went through so many years of, um, it was a long time, though, but I'd go in the mirror  and I'd take those little, like, cuticle scissors or whatever, the tiny scissors, and go like,  and just nip out the little white hairs that were poking out here and there.  And then I noticed, like, once it started looking like a mangy dog after I was done,  I'm like, nah, this ain't work.  I can't cut him out anymore because it's like the bulk of what it is. 
[00:08:30]  You bring back memories.  You're so right.  I remember when I started getting, you know, a little gray in the sideburns.  I did the same shit.  It's easy.  Like, at first, you could get away with plucking a couple.  You could control it.  And then one day, you look at the mirror.  Well, you just said it all, but I'm just backing you up.  All of a sudden, it's just all spotty.  It's, like, complete holes.  That's a whole bulk of hair that's removed there.  It doesn't, it's not good anymore.  That's funny.  Yeah.  You know how awful it was to walk in last night and see Keith in the first word out of his mouth? 
[00:09:00]  Just for men, stupid.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's just not a nice guy.  He's not a good person at all.  He's not a good person.  The graying of Jim Norton.  We went to the end.  You don't like it?  No.  No?  I don't.  Why?  It looks good.  It feels old, though.  Have you tried anything?  No.  I've never done anything like that.  No?  You should try.  You shouldn't do Just for Men, though.  No?  You gotta go to a real fucking hair place and have it done.  But my hair grows so quick and I cut it, I'm afraid it was so short it would be noticeable 
[00:09:30]  immediately.  Maybe.  I might do it blondly.  E-Rock does.  Nice.  You should do that.  You should try it.  If it doesn't work, then you just shave your head.  Who cares?  No one will even know.  Yeah.  We went to the Amy Schumer premiere last night for her new show, Inside Amy?  Yes.  Inside Amy Schumer.  Inside Amy Schumer, yes.  It's the official name for Comedy Central and...  Conjures up images of her vagina.  Yes, it does.  Inside Amy Schumer.  Well, Come Inside with Amy Schumer was the original title, and it looked like Come Inside  Amy Schumer, which was fucking hilarious. 
[00:10:00]  It's great.  But I kind of get why they couldn't have that on buses.  Right.  I'll tell you right now, I mean, we've all seen a lot of clips from the show as it was  being made over the last, what, eight months or so?  Yeah.  And she's got a huge hit on her hands.  It's funny.  It was funny from beginning to end.  That was a complete episode they showed, right?  Yeah.  I'm guessing that was the first one.  Yeah, it was really fucking funny, man.  And I think it's going to do incredibly well for Amy Schumer.  It's good for her, man.  And when you see her, she went up and she talked after, I think, Ken Alterman, who's 
[00:10:30]  I think the vice president of everything, he's like right below the top guy, read a  letter.  It was very funny because he went up and he read a note to introduce Amy that Amy had  written for him to read, which of course was very fucking very funny and just mean-spirited  and pro-Amy.  And then she went up and talked for a little while to everybody.  And she was so funny and comfortable speaking like that.  You're like, she's going to be fucking really fucking famous for a long time. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And she's genuinely funny.  So I'm happy for you.  You don't always feel that about the comics, but her, I genuinely feel like she's great.  And there were just so many fucking laughs.  It's edgy.  It's clever.  It's just fucking funny, man.  Holy shit.  And then they were showing clips at the cocktail party and Kurt Metzger has a fucking bit in  the show.  And I didn't even see the odd.  You can't hear it because the music was playing, but they just had the show playing. 
[00:11:30]  Holy fuck.  Him just completely, you know, naked.  I guess it's a, it's a sex tape bit.  Right.  Yeah.  Film from Amy's perspective.  What, what the woman actually sees.  It was visually, it was hilarious.  I can't wait to, you know, to see the actual bit with the audio.  I heard, I actually heard about that bit.  I didn't see it.  Kurt's one of her writers and Kurt's a great writer.  Oh my God.  He's hilarious in this fucking scene.  You could just tell.  And his girlfriend, she was there last night.  I don't think he was. 
[00:12:00]  And, uh, they were talking about it or she was talking about it one night at the cellar.  But like, yeah, we did this sex tape and Esty thought it was like a real sex tape.  And she's like, what the fuck are you, like, this is really weird miscommunications.  People thought they made an actual fuck tape.  I think the bit is Amy made a sex tape and that she's trying to like sell it.  I think that's, uh, I think that's what the bit's about.  Oh, okay.  Uh, and then the opening fucking bit, the two girls, one cup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy, viral marketing fucking video, whatever. 
[00:12:30]  Get him to work on it.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  That's fucking funny.  Is this the whole episode online?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's weird.  Why would they do that?  When does it premiere?  Tuesday's when it premieres, but they, they did the whole, I think it's probably just to  start a buzz going.  Right.  The whole first episode online.  Is that the first episode?  Oh, they did.  Okay.  All right.  So on comedy central.com.  Oh, cool.  So we should link this to our Facebook page.  Cause this is the episode they, they showed last night.  Got just massive laughs the entire fucking time.  So I'm really, really, really happy for Amy. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And even though I was so distracted, cause Parker Posey was there and I'm really jealous.  Oh, why is she?  Yeah.  She didn't, uh, stay.  No, she hung for a bit and then left.  And, uh, we were looking for her.  Uh, we were looking for her for you.  Yeah.  I want a picture, but yeah, of course, but I didn't get one.  I didn't want to interrupt Amy's fucking, I didn't want to walk up in the middle of the fucking  Parker presentation.  Park, park.  She was really funny when she was thanking everybody.  Yeah.  It was great.  She talked about, uh, Jesse. 
[00:13:30]  She's like, I'm so happy you're flirting with a drinking problem.  She says really funny, mean shit.  Yes.  Yeah, she's good.  Yeah.  So Amy's show is going to be fucking massively successful.  Tuesdays on, uh, Comedy Central?  9.30.  9.30.  9.30 or 10.30?  It might be 10.30.  I think it's on after Tosh.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Tosh, is Tosh on every night?  No.  Tosh is on once a week, right?  Uh, is he?  Not sure.  It's on so many times.  It's on so many times.  Right after Tosh.  Was he a Tuesday or Wednesday guy?  That's their big leading show. 
[00:14:00]  A Tuesday or Wednesday guy.  What's wrong with me?  It's Tuesdays after Tosh.  Tuesdays after Tosh, I think, uh, I think Amy will do all right with that slot, huh?  That's a rough spot because nobody watches Tosh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she'll do great.  Yeah.  And like, yeah, the new episodes is once a week, Tosh.  But then, you know, it runs.  They replay.  Wow.  It's like the Tosh channel.  It really is.  They play a lot of those Tosh episodes.  Yeah.  He's got funny shit.  Man, he just, he just will not come on our show, man.  No.  Has he, has, uh, they pitched to him? 
[00:14:30]  I haven't heard him do much radio or press at all.  To tell you the truth.  Our, our fans are constantly hitting him up.  Like, do Opie and Anthony.  I haven't seen him do anything.  Yeah.  Has he ever, he, he, he been here on these, I've never heard of him being here on the East  Coast.  Yeah.  We'd like to have him on.  Or maybe, maybe this.  I don't know.  I think I've met him once, maybe twice.  Yeah.  Everyone was talking about how, uh, good Jimmy looks. 
[00:15:00]  Of course.  Yeah.  And then Jimmy has to go, no, I still got a little ways to go.  I do have to.  I don't mean to say that.  No, you look great.  Svelte Norton.  Take the compliments.  Everyone's like, holy shit, you look great.  It does feel nice when people say nice stuff.  It does feel really good.  And it means, it, believe me, it keeps me going.  Cause it's like, Hey man, it's fucking, it's really nice to hear.  But you know, it's like, you know, yourself.  And there's like, I just, that part that I've always had a hard time with is that final.  I don't, I don't need washboard abs, but you know, I would like to have something.  Be nice.  Once in a while, when I first wake up, if the fucking shadow's right and I stand right, 
[00:15:30]  I can almost see the outline a little bit.  Sometimes I'll just stand there for a few seconds.  Oh boy.  Look at myself.  Look at yourself.  We're fucking girls.  I know.  We are.  But it's weird.  It's like, Keith caught me last night too.  Cause someone, a woman walked up who I had, I guess met at a network or something.  And I was talking to her and when she walked away, Keith is like, if I fucking ever see  you rubbing your stomach when you talk to a girl, I was rubbing my, but I didn't mean 
[00:16:00]  to do it.  It's like, look, look, look at this area right here.  I just can't stop doing it.  Oh, Jimmy.  I can't help.  You wanted her to notice.  So you were, you were moving your hand around.  No, he just does it as he's talking.  Cause Bobby pointed it out too.  Oh, Bobby.  Okay.  But it was Bobby.  I used to do it like for the raw, like, you know, always like, like, like fixing my shirt.  Yeah.  Just fixing my shirts or my fucking.  Well, I think we've talked about it on the show.  There are times you look over at Jimmy and he's pinching what used to be his fat.  Cause he doesn't have it anymore. 
[00:16:30]  And he would just fucking like yell at himself right in the middle of the show.  You would look over like, what is he doing?  We just have those moments.  You would just grab it and just get violently angry at yourself.  But anyway, yeah.  Amy Schumer.  Good for you, man.  She looked sexy last night too.  She always looks sexy.  Tight red dress on.  Always looks sexy.  She does.  Her hair was rough to one side.  That fucking 4th of July party when she was in her little bikini.  I couldn't stop looking at her.  Fuck.  I don't, I don't look.  I wanted some of that ass. 
[00:17:00]  I can't look at my female friend.  I'm really weird.  And it's not like I'm the guy friend.  I just, I mean, even in my private thoughts, I can't look at my.  Yeah?  Yeah, I can't do it.  I don't look at my friends.  I don't want to start thinking that way about like women that I really love as people that  I'm friends with.  It's okay.  No, she fucking, she's a little too sexy to not look at like that.  Yeah.  Well, she should have been voted sexiest woman alive.  Oh, wow.  Instead of Gwyneth Paltrow.  Gwyneth Paltrow was not really sexy.  She's not.  No, she's not.  No, it's not sexy.  It was the most beautiful woman. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, most beautiful woman.  In the world.  Right.  And Gwyneth Paltrow won.  And they're killing her today.  Yeah.  They are killing her.  All the papers have it.  And it's like, is she?  It's not like, hey, she's voted most beautiful woman.  It's like, she's voted most beautiful woman?  Right.  Question mark.  Like, what?  Well, who else was up for it?  Yeah.  Who the fuck was up for it?  That she won.  Fucking Hedda Nussbaum?  Remember her?  Yes, I do.  Good reference. 
[00:18:00]  What a looker.  Yeah, she was terrible.  She had hair like the young Boston bomber.  That's who his hair looked like, that fucking kid.  Hedda Nussbaum.  What's the criteria?  I guess it's not just looks, right?  I don't know.  Your last name has to rhyme with Faltrow.  It's got to be all-encompassing, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  But she's not a good person, though.  They were basically saying she's just a bitch on wheels.  She's kind of a shithead.  I don't know what it is.  It's, yeah, it's supposed to be like, oh, it doesn't.  She's not ugly.  We don't just mean physical beauty. 
[00:18:30]  We mean just all around a beautiful person.  And I'm sure they always put, like, fucking Michelle Obama in there.  Right.  And stop it.  She's not.  Well, let's go through the list, Sam.  Can you start over?  I'm sorry.  All right, Sam, start over.  So you got to Gwyneth Paltrow.  She won the whole thing.  Now, let's also think on terms of would you fuck her or not.  Yeah.  Because then everyone makes the list.  Well, we would fuck all of them.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Now, Gwyneth Paltrow.  The criteria has to be, you know, would you for the story?  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Would you because she's hot?  That's a good picture of her because she doesn't look like that.  But she looks more like she does on this picture on the New York Post where she's, you know, those actresses got to deal with some fucking aging issues.  They're killing her in the Post.  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  Oh, did you read that?  Oh, yeah, I did.  Yeah.  All right, what else?  Let's see.  All right.  Kerry Washington.  Kerry Washington is sexy.  Eh, I don't see it.  Kerry Washington. 
[00:19:30]  What did she do again?  Well, she was in Django most recently and she was on the show Scandal.  Right.  Was she the girl, the wife in Django?  Yeah.  What's her name?  Broomhilda?  Yeah.  Let me see her.  She's beautiful.  She is beautiful, but I wouldn't put her as one of the hottest around the world.  We know why you don't see it, Ant.  It's okay.  Oh.  It's okay.  Yeah, I wouldn't give her that.  I wouldn't even go to Paltrow that top honor either.  All right, Kerry Washington.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Amanda Seyfried.  I like her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's your type right there, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Amanda Seyfried got some big titties.  She does.  Yes.  She got a nice ass on her.  Does she show them off anywhere?  Yeah, she has.  Where?  You want to see?  Yeah, I want to see.  Of course we do.  What are we, gay?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Gay fucking shit.  Mr. Skin.  All right, we go right to Mr. Skin.  Mr. Skin.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Is that her ass?  No.  Oh, that's a nice ass.  That's an ass.  That's a nice ass.  That sure is a nice ass.  Wow, really?  She does.  Yes.  Holy fuck.  She got naked in a movie?  We're topless?  What movie?  I don't remember what it was called.  Come on.  This is so self-serving because no one could see this out there.  Who cares?  Fuck them.  I want to see.  Fuck them.  It's right.  Come on.  Where?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  How long was she topless?  Like a split second. 
[00:21:00]  See the video, too?  I know.  That's the funny thing is it's a split second, but Mr. Skin, I mean, you could have it where  she's naked for two straight hours.  Right.  Just fucking sit there.  Just leave it right up there.  On the screen.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at that bouncing.  Very nice.  Big tits.  Yeah, she's very sexy.  Who is she?  Amanda Seyfried.  Why doesn't she get the most beautiful girl?  Yeah, she should be above Gwyneth Paltrow.  What movie was that, Sam?  That movie was called Chloe.  Okay.  But who is she?  She's just an actress?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Most recently, she starred in Les Mis.  Yuck.  Ah, right.  It was a good movie.  She should have been topless for it.  Stop it.  Would have been better.  Yes, of course.  All right.  Oh.  Ugh.  Zooey Deschanel?  Zooey Deschanel.  No, I can't handle her quirkiness.  No.  No, her giant eyes.  Her giant eyes.  What are you afraid of, miss?  Jesus Christ.  She looks horrified.  I've seen that look on the subway a lot.  She's a bit quirky, as in all the time. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Everything has to be some kind of quirky thing.  Look out.  Jesus.  Sweetheart of the hipsters.  Hipster girl, yeah.  I did Lena with her, and I took a picture, and she wasn't mean or bitchy, but she wasn't  particularly ingratiating either.  I could see that.  She's the new girl.  I was just on a segment, and she was going on.  I'm like, we were just finished the show.  I'm like, take a picture.  She's like, okay, but I gotta go.  It's like, I'm not asking you to fucking shoot video.  Oh, right.  Shut up.  Oh, fuck you.  I know you gotta go.  I didn't say, hey, can we go for a ride around the lot and talk? 
[00:22:30]  Right.  Hey, can we talk?  And you're doing the same show.  That should be a no-brainer.  Sorry, I know you're more famous, toots, but the camera didn't turn off when I walked out.  Ah, whatever.  She's a TV star now, though.  I know.  She's got beautiful eyes, and she's, you know, she's fine.  Who's next?  Oh, stop it.  Jane Fonda is 8,000 years old, Methuselah.  But why?  Is there a reason why they put her on the list? 
[00:23:00]  She was asked, she's 75 years old, and she was asked for her beauty secrets, and she equipped  good genes and a lot of money.  It's such horse shit.  No, that-  This list's a bullshit.  That's a different category.  That was the most attractive traitor.  Yes, that's it.  Most attractive fucking traitor in a time of war would be her.  You're not beautiful or hot if the picture of you is a little further away, and it looks  like there's a headlight behind you.  Right, exactly. 
[00:23:30]  They're throwing a lot of light at her from behind.  Most treasonous person.  Yeah.  Instagram filters on top of it.  Oh, please.  Yes.  Now we're talking.  Jennifer Lawrence.  Jennifer Lawrence.  Very pretty.  J-Law.  She probably should have been number one.  Yeah, they started to call her J-Law.  J-Law.  They had pictures of her in the paper the other day of a photo shoot she did when she  was younger as a model.  Oh, she looked great.  Yeah.  J-Law.  I think she's very hot.  Very hot.  She should have been the most beautiful woman in the world.  She had a great year, too.  Yeah, I think she should have been number one this year. 
[00:24:00]  Look at us.  We're doing like a fucking entertainment break.  Yeah, we really are.  This is cool.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I like it.  Ba-da-da-da.  Ba-da-da.  Ba-da-da.  Ba-da-da.  Ba-da-da.  Ba-da-da.  We're just looking at 11 right now.  I mean, there's 11 people on the list.  This is number seven.  All right.  We're almost there.  Number seven is Kelly Rowland.  What?  Kelly Rowland.  Actually, I do like her.  What?  She's the Destiny's child who's not Beyonce or the pit bull looking one.  Stop it.  I think she's better looking than Beyonce. 
[00:24:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  Sorry, Sam Roberts.  Take a hike with Beyonce.  I know you're a big fan of Beyonce.  I know you're a big fan of Beyonce, but Beyonce's got a fat cellulite ass.  It's big, fat, fucking cellulite ass.  Beyonce and I like that.  I like her big ass.  No, you don't.  I do.  If you saw it in person, you'd be like, ooh.  Nah, I'd probably like it.  Yes, you would.  I'd probably give it a kiss.  No.  Yeah.  If she ripped her pants down in here, you'd be like, it'd be all dimpled with fucking fat  cellulite.  Not kissing.  Nah.  And those fucking black chick stretch marks. 
[00:25:00]  Goddamn black chicks.  They don't fucking wear stretch marks well.  White chicks don't either, but black chicks.  Wow.  Yeah, it's more obvious than black chicks.  Wow, is it ever.  It's more like a dried up river bed, right?  Yeah, it's crazy.  Have you seen the fucking, the rivers of Mars?  We missed out on it, but I think it was last week, Serena Williams, some more bikini pictures  of her popped up.  Did you see them, Sam?  No, but I would.  Because you're all about the pop culture.  No, you wouldn't.  I'm telling you, anyone that thinks she has a great ass is crazy.  She looks like, in a bikini, she looks like one of those monster things that, like, was 
[00:25:30]  normal, normal person, walking around, and then something happened, and she grew, and  she's still in the bikini.  Like Hulk.  Look at this.  Look at that.  Get the fuck out of here.  Maybe you're right on this one.  I don't know about this one.  Wow.  It means you're into men a little bit as well, if you're into Serena Williams' ass.  Yeah, if you want to grab that ass like that.  I don't know if those are the latest ones.  Jesus.  Are they?  Yeah, whatever.  Her abs look like fucking, she looks like Tupac. 
[00:26:00]  She has Tupac abs.  Right.  I've seen photos that I like, but not this one.  No.  No, man.  But that's her, that's really her ass.  Yeah, you guys are seeing.  Without the photoshopping and all that shit.  You guys are seeing, yeah, nice pictures that are.  Like right there, it looks fucking good, man.  It does not.  No, that's a big, juicy woman's ass.  No, it's not.  That's an Olympic sprinter's ass.  It's too plump to be a guy's ass.  On the men's team.  That's too plump to be a guy's ass.  That's too plump. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know, man.  That's rough.  There are a lot of pictures where she doesn't look good, she looks too big, but there are  some with that fucking big fat ass hanging out the side of the bikini that I would love  to fucking rub a little oil on it.  Intimidating as all hell.  Really?  Yes.  I would, see, I would just accept the fact that I'm going to do a terrible job by her.  Or, like, I would never be, I would just put my dick in knowing that this is not going  to be amazing for you.  No.  No.  For me, it'll be good.  It'll be a big, squishy pussy.  For you, it'll be boring.  Look how fake that is.  Thank you, Ant.  Because now we're looking at, like, professional bikini pictures of Sherina Williams. 
[00:27:00]  You look at that, you would go, oh, wow.  But they're shaving the sides down from her ass, and that's what it really looks like.  There you go.  Yes.  Okay.  Get back to the...  She knows I'd have a good time, though.  Kelly Rowland, though, from Destiny's Child.  Right on, man.  Nice.  Oh, enough with her.  Enough with her.  Oh, beautiful Halle Berry.  No, she's not.  Stop it.  She was.  With her dikey haircut.  She was for a time.  I think she's beautiful, but she's not in that category. 
[00:27:30]  No.  She's just not in that top ten in the fucking world.  This is your PC list.  Yeah.  Her moment's over.  People stinks.  This is stupid People's Magazine.  People's Magazine.  It's amazing we're getting mad at People's Magazine.  Stop.  Drew Barrymore.  Drew Barrymore.  What the fuck are you talking about?  She's a frump now.  If she wasn't famous, and she was walking down the sidewalk, and you looked at her, would  you be like, that's one of the most beautiful women in the world?  Furthermore, if she hadn't been famous when she was a kid, there's no fucking way she'd  be famous now.  She'd be famous now, right?  She could not be an adult actress. 
[00:28:00]  She was grandfathered in, literally.  Grandfathered in.  Yeah.  And there's only one angle that you can take the picture from.  Right.  Or it doesn't show you that massive, ridiculous chin of hers.  Massive chin and bent face.  Her whole head is bent because of that chin.  It's bent sideways or something.  It's like you took a big, long face and then bent it like a crescent moon.  It looks like an incomplete Mr. Potato Head.  Yes.  No, she's not.  No, I'm sorry.  I used to be a big Drew Barrymore fan, as far as her being hot and sexy and shit. 
[00:28:30]  But that ship has sailed.  Yes, it has.  Actually, that's nice, though, when she doesn't have all that makeup on.  Why is Scarlett Johansson not on this list?  Is she?  We're not through the list yet.  Oh, you're right.  How is she?  She's not hotter than Jane Fonda?  How many we got left?  Two left.  Two left.  Two left.  I mean, you know.  All right, let's go.  Next one.  Ah!  Pink is a man!  Now, stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  She's a man.  Pink.  Pink wants to be a man so badly. 
[00:29:00]  A lady put this list together.  She should just go for it and get the penis, man, because that's what she wants.  Pink is not fucking hot.  She was never hot.  She has a square body.  Look, there's nothing going on there.  There's no hips.  She's got the V.  It goes from armpits to fucking hips, and it's a straight line.  She's got a man V.  Yeah, she's got the V.  She's like it.  There's gams, huh? 
[00:29:30]  I don't know, dude.  You didn't kiss that tattooed leg?  No.  Get a little smoosh.  Look for the story.  Want to go?  Yeah, last one.  Back to Gwyneth Paltrow.  I'm sorry to tell you.  Oh, it's the top ten.  Pink was in.  And number eleven was the actual cover photo of Gwyneth Paltrow.  So that was your top ten world.  She's a beautiful woman.  It's the most beautiful issue.  What happened to Megan Fox?  Exactly. 
[00:30:00]  Scarlett Johansson.  Like Kate Middleton.  She's pretty fucking attractive.  Scarlett Johansson should be in there.  What about Selena Gomez?  Selena Gomez is pretty fucking hot.  I must say.  She was in here yesterday.  I must say.  Did you get to see her?  Yeah.  I saw her last time.  She's fucking beautiful.  I'll tell you.  How old is she now?  I think at least twenty.  She is, right?  Yeah.  She's still got a tiny little kid face.  I saw the picture with the fucking morning mashup.  Nicole?  Nicole.  Morning mashup style.  Took a picture with her.  It's like. 
[00:30:30]  What?  I don't know.  You probably shouldn't take a picture with fucking Selena Gomez.  Oh, jeez.  I'm just saying.  Are you saying to knock down Nicole's number a little bit?  Yeah.  It's like.  It knocks down your number?  I mean, it happens in here all the time.  Yeah.  I mean.  It happens in here all the time.  You take a picture.  When fucking.  When fucking.  You know.  Like a guy comes in here.  Gerard Butler.  He's in here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  They're fucking.  You know.  Knocked your number down. 
[00:31:00]  You're fucking standing there.  You look like a fucking piece of shit.  I fucking hate it sometimes.  Next to these people.  Selena Gomez is pretty fuck.  Yeah.  She's beautiful.  Nicole looks like her mom.  Oh, God.  Ouch.  All right.  That was pretty brutal.  How disgusted would people be in her camp if she fell for me and we began dating and  they started just Googling my act.  Nice.  And the things I've said on this radio show.  How fucking fast would her PR people beg her to stop?  Yeah.  AJ in New York.  Let's all look in the mirror before we judge these women.  Good point, AJ. 
[00:31:30]  You know what?  You can't be serious.  I hope he is.  He's right.  Yeah?  Why?  Hello?  Atta boy, AJ.  Are you being serious?  You know, who are we to judge?  I want to know.  Okay.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Who are we to judge these beautiful ladies?  Right.  All right, AJ.  Thank you.  Anyway, guys, really, I'm just fucking around, but I'll tell you.  All right.  It's the same thing, because when David Duchovny comes in, right?  And you've got to take a picture with a David Duchovny. 
[00:32:00]  You're just kind of like, ah, I look like a fucking piece of shit.  He's all Hollywood guy kind of looking.  It's the same thing here.  You've got, you know, mashup Nicole, and she's there.  And, you know, first of all, she doesn't come in all made up, all gussied up.  She's just doing radio.  Right.  And then you've got the beautiful Selena Gomez with her makeup done and her angelic little face.  Her head tilt.  Her head tilt.  She knows how to take a picture.  I mean, it looks like Nicole's photobombing a shot of, uh, it's not. 
[00:32:30]  Nicole looks like her drunk aunt at a party that just came over to get in the picture.  Like Nicole looks like the drunk aunt that just smoked a Benson and Hedges and runs over.  Come on, honey, take a picture.  That's so not fair to Nicole.  It's not.  She's definitely a good looking woman.  She's very hot.  It's just not a good picture.  But she just picked the wrong fucking picture.  And wearing a cardigan.  You can't wear a cardigan.  She's got a cardigan.  When you're taking a picture with Selena Gomez. 
[00:33:00]  And she looks like she's jumped into the shot and went, ah!  Yeah, exactly.  Nicole Durante.  Ah, cha, cha.  But it's just the angle of the picture and the shadow.  Nicole's shadow, like, and the things.  Yes.  It's just not a flattering angle.  The shadows aren't good.  This is the other.  Nicole looks really hot.  Wow, what's she doing there?  Oh, look who we got here.  I'm glad I brought that.  She said that motorcycle.  Riding that motorcycle in a bikini.  I'm glad I brought that fucking motorcycle seat face mask recently.  You get it. 
[00:33:30]  You get it.  Yes, I did, Jimmy.  Keep that picture handy.  When Nicole walks by, we've got to ask her about the Selena Gomez picture.  Taunch her with it.  Fucking assholes on her Instagram.  She said to leave nasty comments.  Are they?  Of course.  What are they saying?  What are they saying?  What are they saying?  Selena Gomez is making mashup Nicole look 65 years older.  Jesus, you look like her grandmother.  Oh, my God.  Bad idea, Nicole.  Ugh.  Get the bad idea. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Well, I got to say, when I did click on that link, when she posted it on the Twitter,  I did look and go like, oh, that was a bad move.  It was a bad move.  You just don't do it.  It's like fucking, you know, come on.  Angry dudes that hot chicks won't talk to, leaving comments, just waiting for Nicole to  do something.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Notice there's no shadows on Selena Gomez's face.  She knows how to tilt her head.  And she put it up completely out of the shadows. 
[00:34:30]  And then mashup Nicole has a shadow right under her nose.  And then in the little, the two lines that come off of your nose to the corner of your  mouth.  Yeah.  It's so shadowed in there.  And then she's got like a big shiny spot on her head.  And her hair is pulled back and parted on the side like a man.  But, but Selena Gomez came here knowing.  So she got all dolly.  Of course.  Look at her hair's flowing over her shoulder. 
[00:35:00]  Nicole just does more radio.  There were nine people with her at all times.  Of course.  Making sure she looked perfect the entire time.  Absolutely.  Mashup Nicole.  Not a good idea.  It wasn't a good idea.  Sorry.  Just wanted to.  I just checked the Twitter.  Might as well have taken feet pictures because that would have been.  Imagine.  Imagine that.  Selena Gomez's cute little foot.  And then that big fucking, that big scuba diving flipper.  Muffman 1981 writes a great OP radio. 
[00:35:30]  Kelly Rowland is miles hotter than Beyonce.  Told you, Sam.  You and that dude can hang out together.  You can always find someone to back you up on the internet.  Always.  And then Joe Hoff 23.  Jane Fonda's beauty secret is smothering her face in Viet Cong jizz.  How bad-mouthing America.  Good line, bro.  Oh, boy.  Wow, she's up there.  Selena, yeah.  Yeah, she's going to be a huge star for a very long time. 
[00:36:00]  Did you see Spring Breakers?  No, I didn't.  Oh, my God.  I've seen stills from it.  No, it wasn't terribly good, but.  Holy fuck.  Look at that.  That was her crew in the movie?  Yeah.  It's just hot chicks.  Wow.  Who's the one all the way on the left?  I don't know what her name is.  Who's the one all the way on the right?  Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens.  The one way on the left looks like a young Scarlett Johansson.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I might have to rent that movie.  Oh, my God. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, fucking God.  I can crank to the promo shots.  Oh, my God.  Right?  Good God.  Look at this.  Fucking chicks.  You fucking pieces of shit.  I know.  They're like so hot they just make you angry.  Yeah, that's just completely retarded.  Do you want to jerk off angrily like with my dick not even hard?  Man.  Man.  Anyone else see the Louis C.K. impression?  Oh, my God.  I did, yeah.  That's fucking funny.  That's pretty good.  I think the guy did a pretty good job.  He captured that.  He captured the hand motions pretty well.  The hand motions. 
[00:37:00]  Some of the inflections he got.  The voice isn't perfect, but he gets some of the inflections.  Yeah, the inflection.  The cadence.  The voice going up when he says certain things.  The delay.  The seeming like he's trying to find words kind of a thing.  I thought it was pretty good.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page if you can't find it yourself.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Everything we talk about visually, E-Rock for the most part tries to put it up on the Facebook page.  Yes.  Every day is a whole bunch of visual shit for you to check out.  But here's a little piece of this guy doing Louis C.K. 
[00:37:30]  What's his name?  J.L. Carvin.  You know him, Jimmy?  Is he a stand-up?  Do not know him, no.  One of the younger guys on the circuit?  Yeah, I'm not sure.  Give us a minute of this.  He is a modern-day legend.  He is the most original artist since art was invented.  And he writes more material on a coffee break than most comedians write in their lifetimes.  But now, Louis C.K. has filmed his most daring special ever. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know why the chicken crossed the road.  I'm not some sort of Dr. Dooler.  That's right, Louis C.K. is retelling all the greatest classic jokes in only that special shit A-Way.  He's got all the greats.  In the first place, what a chicken is doing anywhere near a road.  Like, shouldn't it be on a farm fucking other chicken?  Or a chicken, I want to eat you.  That's basically it.  That's our relationship. 
[00:38:30]  Huffington Post declares,  We knew it was great before we even watched it.  Chicken!  He just, he walked.  I don't know what's in the mind of a chicken.  They're stupid.  There's no dialogue or conversation with a chicken.  It just gets eaten and I take a shit.  Why is six afraid of seven?  I don't know.  Maybe because six was, like, coddled by his parents and thinks that everything he does is the greatest in the world and nobody can tell him what to do. 
[00:39:00]  So he's all sheltered and scared.  The bad red wig.  And all of a sudden, seven shows up and rumor has it seven, eight, nine the other day.  His art makes Da Vinci look like a f***ing hat.  Says every single comedian.  Seven's full.  He just ate nine.  He just ate something bigger than his entire body.  That's funny, the side view.  If I ate something bigger than me, I'd die.  I wouldn't go find six and eat dinner.  So my daughter comes up to me the other day and she says, 
[00:39:30]  Daddy, I want to tell you a knock-knock joke.  You haven't heard a knock-knock joke until you've heard Louis C.K. tell one.  Knock-knock.  And I go, who's there?  And she goes, interrupting cow.  I'm like, interrupting cow.  And before I can finish it, she says, moo.  And I was like, you're an asshole.  That's why mommy and daddy are divorced.  Because you can't shut up when an adult is talking.  Like, I don't know if I can do it with my kids.  Penny Youngman never talked about his wife this way. 
[00:40:00]  Not bad, right?  Yeah.  It goes on for a while.  Pretty funny.  Yeah, that went around a bit yesterday.  We have actually Louis C.K.  Well, he's in the new SiriusXM commercial.  Is he?  Yes, he is.  You guys haven't heard this?  Oh, well, no, I haven't heard this.  Yeah, it's terrific.  Oh, boy.  What?  They love him here.  And so they were like, we've got to get him to endorse our product.  That's right.  Had that big meeting with Scott Greenstein. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  They're now working together.  It's great.  I'm surprised you guys haven't heard it yet.  Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Entertainment for everyone.  Coast to coast, commercial free music.  We've got you covered.  It's one.  As long as I got my soup.  Ozzy's Boneyard.  Eminem's Shave 45.  And that's not all.  Outrageous talk.  We've got you covered.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  Ron and Fez.  Nino and Rich.  Clark says hi.  Jenny Hutt.  Some website.  Plus, the best in politics.  Sports and more.  It's everything the celebrities are talking about.  Funny man.  Louis C.K.  You know, when you buy a car, you don't decide what kind of radio you get.  First of all, these are the same fucking company.  It's a merged two companies into one company, right?  Is it a Sirius radio?  No, it's a Sirius XM.  That's what the company is.  Well, you have an XM radio.  Wait a minute.  But it's Sirius XM.  It makes no sense that it's two different kinds of radios.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[00:41:30]  I have to pay a premium to listen to Opie and Anthony in one car.  And a premium to all this and a Howard and the other car.  I would have to pay two premium fees.  How do they expect a customer to understand this?  Sirius XM.  The best radio on radio.  If you can figure out how to turn the fucking thing on.  I'm plugging my iPod.  I don't give a fuck.  There you go.  Louis had a great rant that day.  And that really is Louis.  Not the guy doing Louis. 
[00:42:00]  Not a real commercial.  Huh?  How's a commercial?  No chipper.  No chipper.  It's not.  Your fucking face.  Oh, yeah.  George W. was out and about, huh?  He looks good.  Of course.  Man, you gained some years back after you leave the White House, huh?  Fuck.  It's great.  That's this morning live on CNN.  Yeah.  You age horribly, and then you leave the White House, and they give you a few years back. 
[00:42:30]  They give you about two or three years back.  Yeah, they give you a couple.  Unbelievable.  I mean, the pictures of Obama when he started and what he looks like now.  Oof.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Isn't he doing Today Show live today?  Yeah, I think so.  Is he?  I guess they're doing the, uh, they're getting all the presidents together for the opening  of his library.  Okay.  Right.  Well, the former, and, um, Obama.  Obama.  They're doing it.  I mean, these live interviews are always done from a location. 
[00:43:00]  Like, they're secure.  They don't come in studio.  He's just walking down the halls like, hey, guys, are we on air?  We're on air.  Sit down.  George W.  So, what the fuck?  We don't have a lot of ex-presidents right now.  I don't.  Bush Sr., who I think is sick and older, yeah.  But he's still alive, and then you got, uh, you got the Bush, and then you got the Clinton.  You got Jimmy Carter.  Carter.  And then you got Jimmy Carter.  I think that's it, right?  I, yeah, there's five.  Five total with Obama.  With Obama, right.  There's only, there's usually like five. 
[00:43:30]  There's never more than, never more than five, really.  That's because we had some two-termers in there, so.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  A lot of two-termers.  Bush, fucking Clinton, and, uh, Obama.  Bush Sr. is the only one that, and Carter, yeah.  No.  Carter and Bush Sr.  We were at the Amy Schumer thing last night, so I missed A.J.  Clemente on, uh, Letterman.  How did it go?  It was good.  It was funny.  Letterman definitely did a better interview with him than any of these other jokes.  Yeah.  And we all knew he would.  Yeah.  All these other jokers.  And then, uh, I guess A.J. 
[00:44:00]  Clemente has officially blown us off, because I've seen the fans, uh, reach out to him  as well.  Well.  And he, he doesn't even acknowledge that they're asking.  He's on TV.  He's, he's working the TV angle.  And he doesn't really realize that this is over by Monday.  Of course it is.  You know, it's just finished.  Yeah.  Well done.  He's so excited.  The best he could hope for is to get his job back.  His old job, yeah.  Yeah, because at the end of the day, once, once the novelty wears off, he's a terrible  news anchor.  He's not good at all.  He's horrible.  Every one of these shows have had him, uh, give it a try. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  You know, reading the teleprompter, uh, throwing it to somebody, going to break.  He's terrible.  And it's not just a, well, you know, one time and he screwed up.  Every time he's on one of these shows, he, he can't fucking speak.  He couldn't do it from North Dakota.  But why wouldn't you get contacts knowing you can't read?  Because he, he keeps blaming the fact that he doesn't have his glasses.  Not the glasses.  No, but he has to say that.  He can't say, I'm sorry, I'm just a blithering idiot.  Yeah, he's got a horrible delivery. 
[00:45:00]  It's very stiff.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, he just, he's bad.  Uh, well, I gotta see what Letterman did with the kid.  Yeah.  David.  The kid.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Isn't it over now?  I mean, he's not doing press today, is he?  I wouldn't think so.  I mean, it was a one and done.  There'll still be, like, older people kind of finding the video now.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, people that aren't up on it.  Yep.  And tomorrow's Friday.  But what show could he possibly do today?  He did everything yesterday.  Exactly.  No, there's nothing left for him to do.  You think he's just hanging around New York hoping he can squeeze a little more out of this? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, maybe he'll do, like, a best week ever cameo type thing.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, this is A.J. Clemente.  Of course, the guy.  Do we have the clip in front of us?  Yes, we do.  That guy.  I can't believe we actually have to do this, but we do.  Yeah.  People just, some people just don't know what we're talking about for whatever reason.  Where are you?  Are you living under a rock or something?  It's this guy.  You're watching the Evening Sunday on NBC North Dakota News, your news leader in high definition. 
[00:46:00]  Gay fucking shit.  Good evening, I'm Van Tew.  You may have seen our newest from A.J. on NBC.  What?  What happened?  Oh, no, he did.  I haven't noticed that.  Is that on TV?  Did you hear that?  Good evening, I'm Van Tew.  You may have seen our newest from A.J. on NBC North Dakota News, and he'll be joining the Weekend News team as my co-anchor.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, A.J.  Thanks, Van. 
[00:46:30]  I'm very excited.  I graduated from West Virginia University, and I'm used to, you know, from being from the East Coast.  Okay, well, welcome aboard, A.J.  Thanks.  Go for it.  Fatal ATV crash happened yesterday.  This is just terrible.  And the fact that he said he didn't realize they were on live until three breaks later just means he stinks because that was just how he introduced me.  I think he's lying.  Maybe he is.  I think he's lying.  He had to have known because of how he pops his head up and stuff.  I think he had an earpiece in.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Something.  Because he is so bad.  And poor Van.  She's getting no attention.  No heat.  No.  She's going to get on the air today and just start cursing.  Yeah, she's got to be pissed off that he's a big star today.  Anyway, that guy, he was on Letterman.  Right.  Now, what about these goons in the biz work?  Are they going to give you the job back?  They aren't goons.  But do you want the job back?  Because I'm telling you right now, AJ, you're better than that.  If there's better offers, I will definitely. 
[00:47:30]  There should be an offer.  And they should apologize to you.  And you should go back.  Because you're man enough to face the music.  You've been on this show.  You've been on a lot of shows.  You've been on the Twitter and the Face Feed and all of that stuff.  If you want to, you should be offered that job back.  Now, would you take it if they said to you, AJ, come on back.  We accept our responsibility in this.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Let's go forward.  I've thought about it.  But if, you know, ESPN comes knocking.  You're laughing at him. 
[00:48:00]  Look, I'm trying to get you the job back in Bismarck.  Forget about ESPN.  That ain't going to happen.  You're going back to Bismarck.  That's all you can hope for.  Yeah.  To get to go back to Bismarck.  He shouldn't be on television.  So just.  Right.  Yeah.  The fact that he's in Bismarck is huge.  You're right.  Yeah, that's that's about done. 
[00:48:30]  I was glad that everybody was kissing his ass all day.  And finally, Letterman was like, it's not going to happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, you'll get a job.  This is great.  Oh, why don't you read this little piece here?  Mm hmm.  And he's like, the president was at the Rose Garden.  Actually, could you just say gay fucking shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's just that's just fucking.  And it would be a great piece.  It would be a great PR move if they just, you know, rehired him. 
[00:49:00]  I think that's what's going to end up happening.  We'll know this by Monday.  I do believe so.  We're talking from the future.  And he was only the weekend anchor.  They may move him up to weekday anchor just to get that buzz.  They'll just get him back.  Just put him on the weekends again?  Yeah.  That's about all he can handle.  Yeah.  Please.  And they'll probably give him a year figuring out that figuring they can milk it for a year.  Then throw him out the door.  Yeah.  It'll be his big thing.  Like, they'll get a live studio audience.  Oh.  And you'll know it's his thing.  Because, like, from behind the curtain, you hear, gay fucking shit. 
[00:49:30]  Here he comes.  Ladies and gentlemen.  That'll be his thing.  Apparently, there was a couple of fucking people killed when a goddamn car flipped over.  Some cunt was driving.  There he is.  It's the foul-mouthed newscaster guy.  He comes up with a great catchphrase, but you can't put it on a t-shirt.  Yeah.  No.  He can't even sell t-shirts.  GFS TV.  He just blatantly cursed and then go, oh, hope YouTube doesn't catch wind of this, huh? 
[00:50:00]  Huh?  What's up, Matt Lauer?  Yeah.  If you look at the viral video people, the length of time they're actually famous for it, not too long.  We're not really interested in David's next trip to the dentist.  Right.  That or chocolate rain.  Where's he?  Well, he almost made it with a second.  Oh, boy.  He tried.  Yeah, David and the dentist.  That kid's about 18 now. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  It's not his real life.  Right.  Fuck.  He's just getting stoned in his basement now.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Is this going to be forever?  Yes.  You're going to be living in your basement.  Well, Kate is just trying to think of other animals besides turtles that he likes.  Yes.  No one's interested, buddy.  No one cares.  Did you see the video?  I'm sure it's, you know, it's not a new one, but the two kids in the backseat of the car  was in the car seat and he's singing fucking corn. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's hilarious.  That's amazing.  And the kid, like, he's making the faces.  And then he just stops and turns into a little kid again.  Right.  And he's like, blah.  It's hilarious.  It's pretty fucked up.  See this, Jimmy?  No, I did not.  It's amazing.  Look at the kid in the car seat.  They're playing corn over the radio.  And there we go.  Kid just lip syncs to the song perfectly.  Can you make it bigger, sweetie?  Look at his face when he starts screaming. 
[00:51:30]  Look at his face when he starts screaming.  And then look, he goes back to, like,  He's hilarious. 
[00:52:00]  You know what my favorite part about that video is?  You assume that the parent is videoing them?  Yeah.  And you can see immediately in that moment,  they're like, well, little kid's the star.  And they zoom away from the older, like, girl, kid.  Sorry, buddy.  They just knew who the star was in that clip.  That's a fucking funny one.  It's great.  Don't forget, AJ Clemente's got his auto-tune video, too.  Oh, he does?  Well, no, that's what happens with these.  Oh, right, right, right. 
[00:52:30]  Of course.  You know, you get the initial video that goes viral,  and then they auto-tune the shit out of him.  Right.  So he still has that coming.  But you know, with him, he's going to do it himself  and try to put it out on iTunes and really make a go at this.  Yeah, well.  It's not looking good for him, is it?  It isn't, no.  You can already feel it this morning.  The best he can hope for is he gets his job back.  Yeah.  And it took all this publicity and press to give him maybe the chance  that he'll go back to Bismarck.  What ever happened to that Asian guy from American Idol? 
[00:53:00]  What's his name?  Oh, American Idol.  I thought you meant the last Asian guy who cursed on the news.  Oh, well.  Arthur Chien.  Arthur Chien.  He still works.  Remember that?  William Hung.  Yeah, you had to get his job back.  Remember William Hung?  Yeah, I do.  What happened to him?  Where's William Hung?  He won, too.  No, he didn't win.  Of course not.  Of course not.  Oh, God.  He's fatter.  Oh, my God.  I think he's in charge of fucking North Korea now. 
[00:53:30]  I don't know.  Holy fuck.  He's got to be retarded, right?  Come on.  Come on.  Who's kidding who here?  Singing Ricky Martin.  Oh, is he?  That's old, though, isn't it?  Yeah, this was his.  Yeah.  You blow me off like it's all this day.  You lay in fear that I'm taking my weight like it's all.  He was like, he was here.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, come on.  I want to hear the chorus. 
[00:54:00]  Did he ever have a song out there?  Okay.  Yeah, he did.  I think it's time for a little song from William Hung.  He's going to sing.  What year was this?  No kidding.  Okay, that one was a generous.  2007.  She was still trying to look like a woman back then.  Everyone cheers, and they're laughing at a retard singing on stage.  Yeah.  It's like, let's parade the retard out. 
[00:54:30]  Look at his stupid fucking shirt.  Yeah.  Look, he looks all stupid.  Some of the daytime housewives.  He looks like he's stupider than me.  If they're not applauding because he's really good, what are they applauding for?  Yay.  That he's making a complete dick out of himself.  I'm smarter than him, and he's ugly, too.  Yes.  And he stinks at what he fucking does.  Right.  That's what they're clapping at. 
[00:55:00]  Do you want to hear his I Believe I Can Fly sing?  More than I want to breathe.  Yes.  Odd.  Please.  Oh, shimmy teeth. 
[00:55:30]  If I can see it, then I can do it.  But what in that season?  If I just believe it.  I don't even remember what season.  He didn't even make it to Hollywood.  No.  He doesn't make it for the audition.  There's nothing to it.  I believe I can fly.  Oh.  He's fucking good.  I believe I can fly.  Oh, you like it, Chip?  It's fucking beautiful.  Oh, Chip is cheering up.  I can throw it every night and day.  Spread my wings and fly away. 
[00:56:00]  I believe I can soar.  I believe I can fry.  I see me running through that open door.  Oh, God.  I believe I can fly.  He's terrible.  We all know that.  How many years ago was William Hull?  2007.  Yeah.  Wow.  Fantasia, was that year?  Season three?  Yeah, I think that makes sense.  Season three, Fantasia.  What happened to her?  She was just on TV yesterday. 
[00:56:30]  What was she bitching about?  With Snoop Lion, right?  Yeah.  What was she bitching about?  Being fucking stupid or not having a home or something?  What?  I don't know.  She's had her issues.  Wasn't she the one that couldn't read and shit, right?  Yeah.  God.  Wait, can you go back to that Selena Gomez picture?  Yes, I can.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  She's only in half the movie, though.  Oh, yeah?  She's in another movie?  No, we're talking about Spring Breakers.  She's only in half of it?  Only in half of it.  She goes home early. 
[00:57:00]  She hands it off to the other fucking hotties?  Spoiler alert.  Vanessa Hudgens steals the show.  No.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  I'm with you on that one.  Sam, it's too bad you don't like girls.  No, I do.  Really?  A lot of people have that misconception.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I am attracted to females.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  You know who grew up disappointing?  Fucking, fucking, Dakota Fanning.  Yeah.  Dakota Fanning.  Yeah.  Thought she had some potential when she hit that fucking legal mark. 
[00:57:30]  But, you know, she's all right and everything.  She photographs well in some pictures.  But her body's a little freaky.  I don't know, man.  Those eyes are amazing.  Yeah.  She's pretty.  But what?  The body's a little?  Her mouth is weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  Something weird going on with her ass.  She looks a little square.  She looks a little old for her age, too, right?  Yeah, maybe.  It's like that Olsen Twins thing.  Everyone was counting down until they turned 18. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, God.  That was a bust.  Then as soon as they turned 18.  That was a bust.  Disinterest.  Olsen Twins just turned into fucking little gremlins.  They're like little.  That's Dakota Fanning.  Yeah.  I know.  It's tough being a girl.  Really is.  They're fucking, these are, they're 11-year-olds and we're like, ooh, she's going to be fuckable  in seven years.  And then she gets 18 and we're like, ooh, pig alert, pig alert.  It's tough being a fucking girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think she's that bad.  No.  She's all right.  I mean, yeah. 
[00:58:30]  I thought we were going to look at a monster.  She's all right.  I had some higher expectations, though.  Can we see the Olsen Twins?  The Olsen Twins are just midget freaks.  Yeah.  Midget freaks.  Oh, she's cute, man.  I don't know.  That's the other sister, right?  There's one a little more batshit crazy than the other one.  Yeah, that's Elizabeth Olsen.  That's Elizabeth Olsen.  There's another.  Oh, wait.  That's like not one of the twins.  No, that's another one.  That's so weird.  Elizabeth Olsen is cuter than the twins are. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, but she didn't get any heat.  No.  She's starting to get a little heat, right?  How old is she?  Oh, God.  Oh, God, no.  They just look weird.  They're fucking freakish.  Yeah.  They should be standing in front of a fucking hotel door in there.  Kidding the fucking big wheel stuff.  Yeah.  That kid that fucking...  The kid that played the little kid in the ring, the girl.  She's fucking cute, yeah.  She wound up turning out pretty good.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  People are begging that we read more Instagram comments on the Nicole photo.  Jeez.  Why?  This guy's unfettered.  John says you've got to read every single one of them.  Are they all brutal?  I mean, not every single one, but I'd say the majority.  Sure.  Okay, read that one.  Oh, see?  Fuck the haters, mashup Nicole.  I'd still rub those big-ass piggies. 
[01:00:00]  Big-ass piggies?  With her toes?  Yeah.  Big-ass piggies?  Let's see.  You're going to make it 65.  Oh, there we go.  Wow, she really takes Nicole down a few pegs.  Oh.  Like this guy.  Unfortunately, she won't remember you when she is in the elevator on her way out.  Oh.  Why would you just...  Why are you hurting Nicole's feelings?  Well, that's true for all these celebrities that come through here.  Taylor from Cosmo writes, 
[01:00:30]  Jelly!  What does that mean?  Jealous.  Jealous.  Jelly, I'm so jelly.  Oh, God.  Jelly?  Jelly.  You get to meet Selena.  I'm so jelly.  Totes.  Ew.  You would never say jelly?  No.  Jelly.  Why would anyone say that?  Well, you can bet you're going to hear it for the rest of the show.  Oh, I know.  Yay.  Jelly.  I'm going to write it down so you don't forget.  Jelly.  Jelly.  Mash-up, Nicole.  Is that your daughter?  Well, it sort of looks like it could be, right? 
[01:01:00]  But then it's just one of these guys who tag...  And then he tags Obie Radio on it to be like,  Hey, Obie, look at me.  I'm making fun of somebody.  How old is Nicole?  It's legal she's 30.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me, Tony.  Tony, look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Hey, come down from there.  What are you doing?  If Nicole was a young mom, it's possible.  No, it's not.  I don't think so.  No.  I sure had her at 10.  Nicole's beautiful, though.  It's just not fair.  That picture...  What happened to her yesterday?  ...is terrible.  Sometimes you've got to sacrifice... 
[01:01:30]  Here's the sacrifice you've got to make.  Sometimes you've got to sacrifice the thrill of posting a picture of you with a celebrity  because you know it just don't look good.  I got a handful, easily, of pictures with, like, A-listers that have come through here  that I never post it because I just know the abuse.  Just look terrible.  More than usual.  Just horrendous.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so she probably should have just said, Fuck it.  She should have looked that pic and went, Ah, well, maybe next time.  She should have tweeted, I got a picture with Selena Gomez. 
[01:02:00]  Take my word for it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But then you got the bikini pic.  Yeah.  And she looks fantastic.  Who is that guy?  It's Ryan from the Morning Mashup.  Oh.  What does he do?  He's one of the four hosts of the show.  Oh.  He's the one you always forget.  Oh.  What does he do for the show?  He's a host.  I told you that.  See, now she's with Ronnie from the Jersey Shore.  She looks all right there. 
[01:02:30]  Of course, because, you know.  How is he?  She looks really pretty there.  Ronnie was cool as hell.  She has a nice smile and fucking cute little dimple.  Nicole looks really, really awesome.  Yeah, she looks good right there.  I like Ronnie.  He's all right.  Yeah, he's fine, right?  Yeah.  Ronnie's all right.  Oh, yeah.  What's he, uh, what are those guys doing now?  Oh, not much.  They're in trouble.  Paulie makes a lot of money, I'm sure, DJing.  And I think the situation will always make some kind of money.  No, the situation's even in trouble.  Yeah, the situation is a flop.  What do you mean?  Ever since he went to reality, he's not the star of that show. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, is his show still on?  No, no, no.  I mean, he's just not the standout from it.  No, and he's, what's he doing?  Right, exactly.  He's not doing anything.  Didn't he have, like, 10 million bucks saved, though?  No, he didn't.  No, I doubt he made that much.  He just started filming a reality show, but no network has bought it.  What's it called?  They just brought it out on TMZ.  They don't have a title.  No network's attached to it, but he's filming a reality show.  He did a lot of drugs and hired a lot of family members.  Yeah.  You know.  He went through a lot of money?  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Well, you got JWoww and Snooki.  They're doing all right with their spin-off.  Yeah, JWoww, Snooki, Pauly, they're all bigger stars.  What about Vinny?  Well, Vinny's got his show coming out soon.  MTV likes Vinny.  Yeah, they do.  They got a boner for him.  And Lil Wayne was at Vinny's house.  Yeah, he was.  With the mom cooking a little Sunday dinner.  Yeah.  Some Sunday gravy.  And some zzzz.  I don't know.  I don't know.  The Lil Wayne was at Vinny's house.  Yeah, I'd like Lil Wayne to stop by my place.  I think it's a great concept for a show.  Yeah, it is.  His family's very entertaining. 
[01:04:00]  They drive these poor fucking bastards out to Staten Island to have to go into Vinny's  house and do a talk show.  And Vinny's mom's in a house coat making spaghetti sauce.  Making Italian stuff.  The food's probably good, though.  You know his mother could probably cook her ass off.  Probably.  And you know some of these celebrities are going into the bathroom doing drugs and shit  while Vinny's mom is trying to put together a nice Sunday dinner.  Just going in and doing lines in the bathroom.  Going through the medicine cabinet to see what kind of pills they can find for maybe the zzzz. 
[01:04:30]  How do you say it, Sam?  I don't know.  Sizzurp.  Sizzurp.  It's like little scizzurps.  Little Snoop Dogg thrown in there.  Sizzurp.  He just interviews big celebrities?  Yeah, in his house.  It's a talk show.  He got Lil Wayne.  Who else did he get?  I don't know.  I'm throwing the trailer out.  I'll tell you who he didn't get.  Let's put the trailer up.  Start over.  Sorry.  There he is.  He's in front of his house there in Staten Island.  This isn't Letterman.  This sure as hell ain't Piers Morgan.  This isn't New York City.  This is not LA. 
[01:05:00]  This is Staten Island and this is my crazy house with my crazy family.  Vinny!  Vinny!  What up?  What up?  He's wearing a t-shirt that says your ego is not your amigo.  That's funny.  This is the show where celebrities come to keep it real.  Mark.  What's up?  Yo, what up, my dude?  What up, man?  This is Kesha.  Hi!  Hey, what's up, Rocky?  How you doing, bro?  This is my friend, Pat.  Hi.  Yo!  Yo!  What up, homie?  What up, what up?  Did you ever eat Italian food before or not? 
[01:05:30]  Um, I think I was eating Italian.  What part of Italy?  Like Sicilian, Neapolitan?  Arizona.  Is that vodka right there?  I smell vodka sauce.  That's for vodka sauce.  Okay.  This party's about to get started.  We're gonna have the Spadini a la Romana.  I don't know anything that you just said.  Do I have basil on my team?  No.  No, sweetie.  You have beautiful teeth.  Okay.  Now, let me warn you about black people.  We eat a lot, and we love hot sauce and ketchup.  I'm gonna call myself Rocky.  I think it's funny, but I don't know what you're saying. 
[01:06:00]  You want me to get naked now?  Yeah.  She is a good.  That's what I mean, though.  This is normal.  Hey, you sure you're not my uncle, too?  Allah, would you whip my body?  Yeah!  In case you're wondering, I am hitting on you.  Ooh!  How are you dealing with SEX in this house?  With what?  No, I am getting warm.  This is my new family.  This is the food family!  There's no other talk show that can get sweat like this.  Check you later, Vinny!  Hi, Nino!  Oh!  Come back and do this to me again!  This is the show with Vinny! 
[01:06:30]  I think we'll do all right.  Yeah, the show with Vinny's a pretty good title, and it's just the production around it's good.  Yeah.  It's got big stars there.  What's this house?  Italian stereotypes.  Oh, it really is.  It's thrown at you.  It really is like...  No, what the fuck?  Hey, oh, we made some pasta for you.  Yeah, there's a bunch of statues with things coming out of the penis.  The mother's yelling out the window at Vinny, like, on the street.  It really is like the stereotypical, like, guinea... 
[01:07:00]  What are you doing, Vinny?  When does it premiere?  May 2nd, Thursday.  May 2nd.  Oh, shit, that's right around the corner.  They previewed it after the movie awards.  Yes, they did.  I saw that one.  Wait, so next Thursday.  Yep.  Huh.  I think Vinny's coming in here.  I hope so.  We should do the interview at one of our houses and be like, Vinny.  Oh, man.  Look what we do now.  Yeah.  How's this?  We gotta get Uncle Nino, too.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Love Uncle Nino. 
[01:07:30]  As well.  All right, we should take a break.  Oh, yeah.  Time to eat.  We got Bob Kelly coming in today.  Bobby.  We got Ronda Rousey coming in at 9.30.  Bobby's Vine video was really funny, where he's like, with the stroller.  He's like, what do you do with this thing?  I haven't seen it yet.  And it's an empty stroller.  Yeah.  And then it cuts to the empty stroller.  He's like, what do you do with this thing?  And then he cuts to the stroller, and his dog is in it.  It's strapped in it.  Really?  It's a good boy.  He starts wheeling him away in the stroller.  It looks really cute. 
[01:08:00]  His dogs are adorable.  He's gonna be dead soon.  Real soon now, right?  Yeah.  What is he, about a month out?  I think so, yeah.  A little over a month out, maybe?  Is that the one?  Yeah.  Oh, he needs some volume.  Oh, he's a good boy.  Oh, look at Kelby.  It'll go around again.  How do you use this fucking thing?  Oh, he's a good boy.  Kelby's racist.  I look at the dog.  It's all strapped in.  He's a fucking thing.  Oh, he's a good boy.  It's looking up at him. 
[01:08:30]  Bobby knows what to do with Vine, too.  That just makes me want to kiss Kelby.  So cute.  Very cool.  Yeah, Kelby loves me.  Yeah.  More than anybody in this room has ever loved anything.  That dog loves me.  It feels like there's no love in the Kelly household until I show up.  It's a household devoid of love until I walk in.  And George St. Pierre is coming in, too.  Holy fuck, that's great.  9.45.  He's not fighting, right?  No, his book is called The Way of the Fight, and he's doing some book signings.  Yeah.  I don't know when he's fighting again, to be honest with you. 
[01:09:00]  I've only read a little bit of the book, but it was actually good, and I wish I'd read it all.  I keep saying that, but I can't get into reading anymore.  It's hard.  No, but my reading habits have gotten so bad,  because I'm so fucking distracted online and all that shit, man.  Oh.  You're not distracted in the gym, though.  No, in the gym I've been doing okay.  Fucking you.  I didn't go yesterday.  What happens online that distracts you, Jimmy?  I just do so many things to look at.  Is it sexual?  A lot of it is.  A lot of it's not.  A lot of it's just, you know, jumping around or I'm playing words with friends 
[01:09:30]  or fucking scramble or any of those dumb games.  Jizz with friends?  Yeah.  Yes.  I have to fly tomorrow to Austin, and I'm worried about the fucking flight being late  because of this fucking FAA shit.  A lot of delays.  Yes.  A lot of delays.  Because of the sequester.  Right.  And it's all horse shit.  It is, right?  Both sides trying to make the other side look bad for the midterm elections,  so they're not going to do anything.  And we suffer?  A bunch of cocksuckers.  And we suffer in the end? 
[01:10:00]  Yes.  That's weird.  Why would they do that?  And meanwhile, no cuts have been made to the Washington area airports.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, they'd be inconvenienced.  Of course.  Wow.  Is anyone still thinking that this government is good, is doing good and in the people's  best interest?  Is anyone still even fucking dreaming that that's what's going on in this fucking country?  It really is amazing what pieces of shit get elected.  And again, this is across the board.  They're just pieces of garbage, these fucking people.  Agreed.  Total shit. 
[01:10:30]  The whole kit and caboodle of them.  They can't find money, really?  They can't find money.  They can't find money to cut.  They're so wasteful with their money.  They can't, like, Obama and the Democrats don't want to cut anything.  They just want to tax the shit out of everybody.  They just had one of the statistics.  The top 50% earners in the country pay 98% of the taxes.  Amazing.  The bottom 50% of the earners pay 2%.  2%. 
[01:11:00]  Is that fair?  When they say fair share, is that at all a just way to divvy up the fucking financial  burden of this country?  That 2% of the taxes are paid by 50% of the people and 98% of the other 50?  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't make any fucking sense.  And all of them, Republicans and Democrats in there, there's no one working in government 
[01:11:30]  that does not have their own best interest, their party's best interest, and the next election  in their minds, way ahead of the people's will and the good of the people.  It's a load of shit.  We've been shucked, my brothers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now I'm going to eat my sandwich.  All right.  Thank you.  What the fuck? 
[01:12:00]  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck? 
[01:12:30]  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  The O.P. Anthony Channel Channel Channel Channel Channel Channel Channel on SiriusXM.  So you're starting a family and you've got a million questions, as any new parent would.  Thanks to the Nicey Nice Network, you'll get the answers you need.  Alright, let's not play the modern day father, okay?  Andrew Dice Clay will set you straight on how to allocate all of those pesky parenting responsibilities. 
[01:13:00]  You stay right there.  When the kid is born, let her do, meaning your wife, what she's supposed to do.  You know what I mean?  You can stand there and watch and applaud and go, you're doing a very good job.  They do the diapering, they're like numb to that shit.  Occasionally there will be those pesky late night inconveniences.  A mother knows how to shut them up, a father does not.  But that's not your problem.  When the baby cries in the middle of the night, I make it simple.  You turn on your side, two feet against her. 
[01:13:30]  You start edging her towards the bed.  She'll know it's not the edge anymore when she goes over.  And she gets up and she'll go, what the fuck?  And you say one word, don't make it a conversation, diaper.  And that's it.  Eventually your partner will need a break.  But be sure to keep her on a short leash.  Babies could sense when the father is watching them.  Cause if you don't, well, just listen to Dice.  Cause when she goes, I just want to go to the gym and work out.  And then you'll get the call.  You know what?  I ran into, uh, Sarah.  She wants to get a little lunch. 
[01:14:00]  Is that a, and what are you going to do?  You go, all right, honey, go ahead.  Next thing you know, Sarah wants to have dinner with her.  We're having a glass of wine at some fucking shit bar.  Next thing you know, it's one in the morning.  You're ripping the hair out of your fucking head.  Here comes this fucking sloppy drunk fucking animal.  And she's going, what's the matter?  I take care of the baby every day.  You can't watch the baby for a few hours.  And you said, you said you go into the fucking gym.  That's what you fucking told me.  You understand that? 
[01:14:30]  And you leave me here.  You know, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  Baby's crying since you walked out of the fucking door.  Next thing you know, you're paying a half for what you got.  Preen up or not, they get fucking paid the minute babies start flying out of there.  Parenting tips with Andrew Dice Clay.  I know what I'm good at.  I know what I'm not good at.  Now available from the Nicey Nice Network.  Your job is to go and you leave.  Have you ever wondered how much hot piss your body produces over the course of your entire life?  How many pounds of dead smelly skin will you shed into your mattress? 
[01:15:00]  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my quest for knowledge and discovery,  seeking answers to the questions that man has pondered since the dawn of time.  On today's episode, how many farts would it take to fill a hot air balloon?  Hot air balloons come in different shapes and sizes, but the average standard balloon takes 65,000 cubic feet of air to lift it.  After squeezing and sharding some numbers, it seems the average human flattus release measures 62 milliliters. 
[01:15:30]  That translates to .0022 cubic feet per fart, or as I like to call them, cubic farts.  That figures out to 29,545,455 farts.  To put that in a warm, moist perspective, all of Australia can fart inside the balloon with enough room for all of Austria to cut one too.  Unfortunately, a fart is mostly nitrogen, and while it is 3% lighter than air, it's simply not enough to lift that balloon. 
[01:16:00]  That myth is busted, but that doesn't mean we still can't fill shit up with farts.  Well, not fill shit up with farts.  I don't even know how that would work anyway, and the shit smells bad enough.  Why would anybody want to put farts inside shit?  Anyway, if you did want to fuel flight with farting, we would need thrust.  The average fart generates roughly .2 newtons.  If you weighed 180 pounds, just budging you off the ground would take 800 newtons.  We would need upwards of a half million liters of fart, or 8,064,516 farts. 
[01:16:30]  And finally, the average human produces about a half liter of farts every single day, so that's one pint glass full of fart.  Every single day, man or woman.  I am buzzed already.  Join us next time on an all-new How Much.  Sirius XM XM. 
[01:17:00]  This is the OP Anthony Show.  When you were young and your heart was an open book.  You used to say, live and let live.  You know you did.  You know you did.  You know you did.  You know you did.  You know you did.  But if this ever-changing world in which we live in makes you give in a cry. 
[01:17:30]  Say, live and let die.  Live and let die.  Live and let die.  They broke up 32 years ago.  They were done by 1981, that's it?  For Wings?  Yeah, I would have said sooner.  Really?  Yeah.  But they had, I guess, a 10-year run. 
[01:18:00]  I never thought they made it out of the 70s.  Summoners.  Summoners.  Well, they probably didn't.  I mean, that was probably the official, alright, we're done.  He was with Wings longer than he was with the Beatles.  Oh, fuck.  Way longer, yeah.  Fucked up.  I like a bunch of Wings songs.  Wings had some big fucking hits.  We're so sorry.  Pat McCartney was just mainstream from the Beatles on.  Yeah.  He never hit that quirky, weird thing until he brought out the ukulele in that last album. 
[01:18:30]  But, you know, because you look at John Lennon and he ain't got all weird shit going on in Ringo Please.  And even George had that weird...  Ravi phase.  I've got to write a song that Ravi'll like.  Good ol' Ravi.  Ravi.  Ravi.  But, Paul?  Holy shit.  The hit maker.  Not so much after Wings.  Uh, what are you kidding?  All of his solo shit during the 80s.  Well, he did the one with Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  But name him. 
[01:19:00]  He had a lot of hits.  Say, say, say.  I guess.  Ebony and Ivory.  Ebony.  I guess.  And Ivory.  What else?  The Girl's Mine.  Silly Little Love Songs.  Silly Little Love Songs.  That's with Wings, no?  No.  I don't know.  Yeah, that's a Wings song.  Yeah.  Was it?  I'm telling you, not so many hits after Wings.  He had some monster songs, but not a lot of them. 
[01:19:30]  Uh-oh.  Who do you want?  Coming Up.  Oh.  It's coming up.  All right.  Okay.  A lot of them.  Ebony and Ivory.  Yep.  The Girl is Mine.  Say, say, say.  All right.  He had a couple.  No More Lonely Nights.  All right.  A few.  Keep going.  Kill me.  Kill me today.  Let's do this.  Spies Like Us.  Oh, God.  He had some hits.  I'm telling you, not. 
[01:20:00]  Well, yeah.  It wasn't like Wings worthy, but.  Yeah.  It drastically.  When you think he went from The Beatles to Wings.  Dance Tonight.  It's kind of hard to keep going.  Huh?  Dance Tonight.  All of our favorite song, right?  Yep.  He's playing the Barclays.  Is he?  Two nights.  Yeah, huh?  I'm going to one.  Yeah.  How much were tickets?  They're not that bad.  The tickets that I got were a hundred.  Really?  Yeah.  A thousand? 
[01:20:30]  Bad seats?  No.  I don't think there's a bad seat in Barclays.  It's so small.  It's 18,000 people.  It's only two levels.  Paul McCartney seems like a really nice guy that tries to keep the ticket prices reasonable.  Unlike the fucking Stones.  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself.  I know that the floor seats were like $3.50, which is pretty good for Paul McCartney.  Right.  Don't forget, there's also four Stones, and they all want to make the money.  With McCartney, it's just him and the band, whatever he wants to pay him.  Yeah.  That's true.  How much is a Rolling Stones ticket?  A lot of money. 
[01:21:00]  That's ridiculous, right?  I think they had like a dozen chief seats or something.  Hang on.  I know that there are a lot of money to see the Stones.  You know, Muse came through, right?  Yes.  Fuck.  What's wrong with me?  I need to get a schedule, because that's a band I would really like to see live.  Yeah.  And they came through, and I realized after the fact.  You don't like Muse, do you?  Eh, meh.  Not to go see them.  No.  Yeah.  That's one band I definitely wish I went and saw. 
[01:21:30]  Let's see.  Rolling Stones at the Staples Center.  I hear Linda McCartney cackling in the back of that fucking song.  It's coming in.  It's terrible.  Hey, there's an anniversary today.  It says, Elvis made his last stage performance or appearance for eight years, 52 years ago.  He was off for eight years?  That's why I'm reading that.  What's that? 
[01:22:00]  Is that the Army years?  No, I think it was...  52 years ago is what, 1961-ish?  Maybe it was.  Maybe it was then.  1961.  But he wasn't on a stage for eight years?  That doesn't seem possible.  What's the story there?  Sam, do you know I wasn't an Elvis fan?  I know.  His comeback special was 68.  68?  Well, that would be eight years.  He might not have been on stage, but he might have been putting out records.  When was that?  61, I think.  Focus on movies, 60 to 67. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, he did a lot of movies.  Right.  But in between doing movies, he didn't hit a stage?  That seems weird to me.  He was not.  He was kind of like The Rock.  The Rock didn't return to wrestling.  Right.  He put out the records.  He did that...  Hey, blue Hawaii.  Oh, blue Hawaii.  Oh, we're going to Hawaii.  Eddie Murphy did a great bit on that, too.  They should've just let Elvis sing all his lines, right?  Yes.  That's what he did.  That was the bit.  What?  It's mine.  It's the Eddie Murphy bit.  No, it's not. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, Elvis, are we going to win that race?  Are we going to win that race?  That's a great bet.  Yeah.  He came back in...  He'd become unhappy with his career, I guess.  He looked all badass when he came back in 68.  In Vegas?  Oh, yeah.  With a leather jacket jumpsuit.  Leather jumpsuit.  He was fucking...  Sure.  That's when he was at the peak.  I forget what his comeback and what he was wearing.  It was like this little thing in the round I watched him doing.  It was on YouTube.  And it was so fucking cool.  He was just a cool dude there.  68 comeback special.  Yeah.  Can we see what that looks like? 
[01:23:30]  I want to see...  That might not be the one I'm thinking of, but there was one where he was  in that black leather.  And then the jumpsuits start looking horrendous.  Just still with capes.  But that made me love him more than a fat guy with a cape.  Oh, yeah.  How do you not think that guy?  Doing karate kicks.  Yeah.  You came to the right place.  There.  You're looking for trouble?  Just look right in my face.  You think you got a lot of pussy?  I was born...  I was just thinking that you're looking at it like, what shit is it fucking him?  I'm talking back.  He was fucking...  He was fucking...  Pretty goddamn good right there. 
[01:24:00]  He was good.  I am.  Well, I'm evil.  So don't you mess around with me.  Damn it.  Yeah, he was young and fucking...  Jesus.  Hell of a fucking voice, man.  Whoa, look at that production.  That was pretty cool.  That was.  Now we're just watching TV.  Yeah.  But at least it's Elvis.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:24:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  But at least it's Elvis.  I completely underappreciate Elvis.  Like, I never got into him and I know how great he is.  Yeah, he was great, man.  I think I gotta watch this whole comeback special now.  What other songs were on this?  Can we look for other songs?  That was it.  Oh, it was one song.  Yeah, one song and it was done.  What a fucking weirdo he was, though.  Oh, yeah, he was.  He's a king, though.  Just a weirdo. 
[01:25:00]  I was on his plane when I went to Memphis to...  Yeah?  It was cool.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  I went to a bracelet with Dyson some candy years ago.  Oh, you did?  We got a...  And the plane's just sitting there?  Yeah.  Lady...  Marty McClawney.  So flew away and it had thump.  Wait, Jimmy.  What's that?  Yeah, I know.  I was like, I'm the fucking pilot, Elvis.  Get some drugs.  What was on the plane?  You can't just say that.  A big king bed.  And the king bed had a giant, like, fucking seat belt.  Like, you know. 
[01:25:30]  It was pretty cool.  I mean, he had a belt across.  He'd probably sleep and he wouldn't have to ever get knocked out of bed.  Yeah.  I mean, it was a smaller plane.  Like, it wasn't like a fucking 757.  But you could see that it was a pretty cool way to travel.  Which I think he hated flying at one point.  Like, Elvis didn't like to travel.  He was watching a bunch of entertainers drop dead from plane crashes.  Yeah.  And the colonel had a plane too.  A smaller plane.  Um, which I believe was there as well.  The colonel.  Now that's the comeback special, 1968.  Yeah.  Is there a video of his last appearance?  Go to 1977, fucking Unchained Melody. 
[01:26:00]  Fucking, it's one of his last concerts.  Ugh.  So that's pretty close to his last appearance?  Oh yeah.  But is there officially a video out there where it's, this is it?  This was his last appearance?  A few of them say it, but this is like six weeks before he died.  That was a hard 10 years for Elvis right there.  Oh boy.  Yeah it was.  Rough decade.  I like him better here when he was all fat.  You do.  I really do.  Travis, this is the wrong one.  Yeah.  You're like E-Rock.  I know.  Let's see.  Oh boy.  But this was one of his last...  8177.  This is six weeks before he died. 
[01:26:30]  I think so.  Well, I need to find an actual video and not just...  Wait, they might have, they might have dissolved into it there.  Did you look for Unchained Melody?  Yeah.  Oh, this is it.  By the mid 70s, Elvis had overcome his fear of flying.  And in 1977, just six weeks prior to his death, Elvis agreed to do another television special.  At the time, he also received an award for...  Moody Farr.  The following performance is testimony to not only the remarkable strength of Elvis' voice, but the amazing talent. 
[01:27:00]  Six weeks before he died, he's all fat on TV.  Oh, he's the best.  My love.  My love.  My love.  My love.  My love.  My love.  It's my love for your touch.  A long, lonely time.  Uh-huh.  Is he tickling the ivories?  Yeah.  Why did he get a mic stand?  Someone's got to stand up holding the mic.  Yeah.  Might be the way he wants it. 
[01:27:30]  So slowly.  You think that guy's arm got tired?  Look how fucking bloated he is.  Look how sweaty he is. He's just gray here.  Two bottles of Coke.  I'm sure it's not Coke.  Scissor.  Scissor.  Look at his face. It's all bloaty.  Still had the voice, though.  Right to the end.  I need your love.  He looks like he had an allergic reaction in his face. 
[01:28:00]  Like he's doing steroids.  And the guy's holding the mic price.  So Elvis didn't have to, like, just...  Elvis probably just wanted to move and just...  You better follow me, fucker.  At one point he tells the guy to move it, I think.  Oh, God.  God, look at the chin.  It's the best.  He loved the unraveling.  The sweating cholesterol.  I love the I don't give a fuck-ness.  Yeah.  Of later Elvis.  His pork chop sideburns are real pork chops.  But the pussy didn't die down at this point. 
[01:28:30]  No way.  I'll be coming home.  Can we trust E-Rock up as 1977 Elvis?  He drops the...  He drops the...  He drops the...  Wow.  Ouch, huh?  My darling...  E-Rock.  I'm hungry for...  E-Rock would make a great Elvis impersonator.  I think so.  Sweating and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  Production.  E-Rock, for the show, can you do the sideburns?  You've been growing the beard here and there lately. 
[01:29:00]  And then you shave it down to the sideburns.  What do you think?  Sure.  It's a commitment.  Sure.  Are you committing?  Be careful.  Last time somebody committed to a hair thing.  No.  I didn't say to any of you.  Why?  Go fuck yourself.  No, I defended you.  Did I ever claim to be a supermodel?  No.  I defended you.  You all are a bunch of fucking mongoloids.  We know.  Who wish you could fuck an average looking chick like me. 
[01:29:30]  We know.  So don't say you're making fun of me.  We're not arguing that whole point.  You're absolutely right.  We defended you.  Right.  Sounds like it.  We did.  We did defend you.  Sam, did we defend her?  We did.  No, you didn't.  I need to go get some water, too.  Anything else to say?  I said when fucking David Duchovny comes in here and I take a picture with him, I don't  even post it because I'm a monster.  We explained the whole thing.  And then we said how beautiful you looked in the bikini photo.  Yes.  That's so nice of you.  I was taking a quick picture with somebody that I interviewed.  But we said that.  Do you think I was supposed to like pose like I'm like a supermodel? 
[01:30:00]  We said that.  You're kidding.  You're kidding.  Then why is everybody tweeting me that you're saying nasty things about me?  You better listen to the replay.  Are you listening to Twitter?  We defended you.  You're listening to Twitter.  I do.  You're crazy to listen to those people.  I do.  They'll drive you nuts.  Don't do it.  Did you see your fucking Instagram comments?  I didn't go to my Instagram comments.  Oh, well, you should look at the comments there.  No, you should not.  Why not?  And see the fact that we were being nice as opposed to them.  We said she came in here ready to take all these photographs.  She's all right.  And we said you come in here to do a morning show and you did a quick pic. 
[01:30:30]  We said all that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Don't look at me.  I wasn't the worst.  I wasn't the worst.  I still love you guys, even though you're all a bunch of fucking assholes.  Why did you take the worst?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I don't want your water.  I don't want your water.  I don't want your water.  Iraq just told me that he posted this photo on the Facebook page.  Oh, all right.  Iraq, why would you do it?  Why?  Because we have to have some kind of visual element.  It's already on Instagram.  All right.  Let me say hi to Josh and Buffalo.  That didn't go well.  I thought Nicole would be on her side today. 
[01:31:00]  I thought she was pretty angry, too.  She really doesn't appreciate what we do for her.  She'd be saying, oh, right?  She looks beautiful.  Way better today than in that Selena Gomez picture.  That's not a compliment.  It is, though.  I thought it was a compliment.  In real life, she's prettier than in that.  That's what we're trying to say.  That's a great compliment.  She's ungrateful.  We were sticking up for her.  Jim said she looks better in person.  You said she looks better today than she did yesterday.  I absolutely think.  When she just walked in, she did not look anywhere near the gruesomeness that was in that photo. 
[01:31:30]  I would pork her.  That's all I'm saying.  I would pork her.  You would?  Yeah.  I'd give her a porking.  She's ungrateful, Sam.  You better fucking smooth things over.  You can't even tell it was the same person.  She comes in.  Her hair was all fucking flowing here.  She had a good look on her face.  She's all angry and sexy.  As opposed to the frumpy, grandmotherly-type picture that she took with Selena Gomez.  Just drawing so much attention to the picture is not a helpful thing. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's what you did.  Wow.  Wow.  I was trying to talk about Elvis.  Speaking of Elvis, Josh in Buffalo has something.  Josh?  I was just going to tell you, you have to play Elvis in Drug Field Rant on YouTube.  Have we ever played this?  Probably.  I don't know if we have.  We've played laughing Elvis, one of my favorite things we play.  He just loses and he starts rambling like you wouldn't believe.  Was he on stage or was it an interview? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, he's on stage.  He was on stage, yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Elvis closed last night.  I'm a little lighter skinned than you thought I was.  I don't have a natural light like I would do on my TV show, you know.  Me and old Harold.  I mean, not Harold.  What's his name?  Albert.  Fat Albert.  Hey, look, look, look.  Somebody gave me this thing here.  Yeah, it really is. 
[01:33:00]  Somebody gave it to me.  I just got an eighth degree black belt in karate.  Karate?  Karate.  You're not an eighth degree black belt.  No, it's not.  After 16 years of doing this art every day, after 16 years, I was awarded the eighth degree,  which carries it.  Let's see, eighth degree.  There's only 10 degrees of black.  So the eighth degree.  Could you pause this for a second?  He's not an eighth degree black.  He would get beat up at the UFC.  Of course.  Nicole's coming back.  Oh, good.  Oh. 
[01:33:30]  Come here.  We just want to know if you calmed down.  I calmed down.  That's what a woman likes hearing.  Have you calmed down?  And when they have a point they're making, have you calmed down?  Like, oh, that's nonsense what you're trying to tell me.  Oh, have you come to your senses?  Have you listened to reason?  They don't want to hear that.  The rest of the mashup is tired. 
[01:34:00]  Why are they tired?  I think, honestly.  Of our bullshit?  Yeah, because they don't get the attention to Cole gets.  That's the only reason.  Oh, okay.  Oh, Kenny, come on in here.  Kenny agrees.  Because Stan was, uh.  If we talked to Stanley T. like we do with Nicole, he'd love it.  Of course.  But he was.  What's going on, Kenny?  Yeah, there's some dissension in the ranks.  Ah.  Because Nicole gets all the attention from the big Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then Rich Davis runs, you know, in second place. 
[01:34:30]  But I found out something on the Covino and Rich show, which brings him down a few notches.  Oh, what is this?  The Covino and Rich show, yes.  I think it's Covino.  No, it's Covino.  Covino, C-O.  Yeah.  All right.  Rich Davis is a thief.  Whoa!  Whoa!  What happened?  Those are some serious allegations.  Well, he admitted it on the show.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He likes to walk around his grocery store and just eat things without paying for that.  Oh, the little taste of a grape or something.  Yeah, he says it's sampling, but it's stealing. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, man.  I've been known to take a radish or two, so I gotta shut up.  Like, he goes to, like, the hot buffet thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like, he walks around.  He, like, eats food.  It's a very tricky situation.  That's why we got our Covino and Rich recap on today's show.  Covino.  Right.  Covino.  He's a thief, huh?  How are we gonna smooth things over with Nicole?  Well, she's not happy because of you guys drawing attention to that photo in a negative way, and the rest of the mashup is unhappy. 
[01:35:30]  Stan, as they're all walking by, is going, we gotta go.  We gotta go.  We gotta miss our break.  Oh, boy.  I know it would make Nicole feel better.  Oh, what?  Do you think she wants to see a picture of my prick?  Wow.  You could text it to her.  I won't send it to her.  Yeah, you can't just send it to her.  That could be a problem.  She's a married woman.  Right.  So if she comes in here, Jimmy will, on his phone, show her a picture of his prick.  You wanna at least get the, get that out there?  Get the message over there.  Get the message to her.  Just to see. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  Just say the guys came up with something that could smooth things over.  Well, the fans all, they Twitter her, too.  Yes, they're a bunch of tattletales.  They really are.  The fans are tattly tales.  They're nasty, nasty people.  Let's get back to Elvis ranting about something.  Onstage drug-fueled rant.  Three, senior master of the art.  The next one.  And the tenth is senior grandmaster of the art.  So that's, that's where I'm gonna strive to go to, which takes quite a while. 
[01:36:30]  We'll keep babbling about.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  I'd like you to meet one of the fellows who promoted me to the eighth degree black.  His name is Ed Parker.  He has about 18 temple schools around the country.  Ed Parker.  What is this?  Is this a concert?  Is he just babbling? 
[01:37:00]  Is there another thought in the audience?  Let's see the book.  There's a friend of mine.  His name is John O'Grady.  He's written a book.  He was...  Imagine going to see Elvis and it's like,  Where's blue suede shoes, you fat fuck?  This is taking up the blue suede shoes time.  What are you doing?  Think Jailhouse Rocker or something.  Right.  Jailhouse Rocker.  It's not the name.  I don't know if this is going anywhere, Sam.  No.  Of course, it's a listener recommendation.  You guys got to...  There's so many videos I click on and links I click on on Twitter. 
[01:37:30]  You guys got to see this.  And I see Opie's attached to it and Jimmy.  And I click on it.  It's like, this is nothing.  It's nothing.  They always stink.  Or if it's something, it's something that we talked about three days ago.  Yes, yes.  Or something I posted a half hour ago.  Yeah.  And then they're like, dude, have you seen this?  Yeah, I fucking tweeted it.  Oh, my God.  Listeners with their recommendations on Twitter. 
[01:38:00]  During the break, could you see if there's anything in this?  I will.  Because maybe it gets good.  I bet it doesn't.  I wish somebody had...  He used to pull people over as a narcotics officer.  That's true.  Who, Mitch?  Nixon.  No, no, Elvis.  Oh.  Nixon made him a DEA officer.  He gave him a badge and everything.  So he thought, well, Elvis gets to the young kids.  But it was just an honorary thing.  Except Elvis would actually...  Oh, he took it very seriously.  Slap a siren on his car.  Pull over.  Officer Elvis would pull people over. 
[01:38:30]  How great would that be?  You know how fast we were going.  Did he actually do it?  I've heard stories that he did.  Well, Pretty Plus More on Twitter also writes, discussing Elvis, who became...  He became so weird that he would have his friends bring their sick children to him so he could  heal them.  Whoa.  Did you hear that one?  Really?  Is that true?  It is.  My mother brought me there.  Oh, how did it work, Chipper?  I don't remember.  She was in the room with him and I was in the living room.  Oh, that's different.  Lamar Presley.  No, that's not Elvis, right? 
[01:39:00]  Elvis Aaron Presley.  Memphis Mafia.  Yeah.  Those were his boys.  And then, Megan, what's your Kitty Vaughn Cupcake writes, Elvis Cut Me and I Bleed is  an Elvis album full of his outtakes and screw-ups.  The full album is on YouTube.  Fuck, can we maybe take a look at this stuff in the back room and maybe bring some of it  to the show?  I don't see why not.  Cool. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Aren't we visiting Graceland on our bus tour?  Oh, right.  One of the stops.  Yeah, our bus tour.  That's happening, right, Sam?  Coming to you this fall.  It's late September.  Really?  Yeah.  Late September is the time frame.  Where are we with this thing?  And you notice we haven't heard anything about it because they won't do anything until fall  when they will tell us there is a problem.  Right.  Like, it's like, well, we've got to put it off to fall so we can arrange things and, you  know, get the ball rolling. 
[01:40:00]  So now it's like, okay, fall.  Now they can drop it off their plate.  Right.  It doesn't have to be dealt with until the last minute again where they won't have enough  time or energy or money to do anything.  It was postponed.  We pretty much would be getting on a bus today.  Right.  Somewhere around this time.  So it was delayed.  Postponed.  So they're working on it, right?  Yeah.  Just you bringing it up has got to piss a lot of people off because I'm sure they're  all counting on you guys forgetting about it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  When you bring it up after weeks.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:40:30]  They talk about it.  Damn it.  I thought they'd forget, like, the Super Bowl.  People saying, all right, the clip we have, you've got to listen to the end of the clip,  which we will during the break to see if it's worth bringing to the show.  And then another guy saying, you've got to check out the video censored Elvis.  That one's supposedly good.  Can we do that as well during the break?  Well, I check out censored Elvis.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be uncensored Elvis?  They want censored Elvis.  And then in one of the Elvis documentaries, this is Clyde in Canada, Elvis talks about  an ugly chick sucking his dick.  Come on. 
[01:41:00]  I want to hear some of this stuff.  Can we find some of this stuff, Sam?  Yeah.  There's a whole bunch of Elvis censored, but I'm sure it's just unnecessary beeps or whatever.  What about the ugly chick sucking his dick?  Let me see.  He talks about that.  Elvis.  Ugly chick.  Ugly.  It comes up.  Chick.  Fucking.  All right, chick.  Dick.  Yeah, right, chick.  Chick.  Yeah, no.  There's some weird gay shit happening.  Yeah.  Elvis. 
[01:41:30]  Ugly dick.  Oh, boy.  That ain't gonna happen.  That didn't work.  Salmon Elvis pops up.  All right, we'll figure out some of this shit during the break.  Don't forget Bob Kelly, George St. Pierre, and Ronda Rousey coming in today.  Very cool.  I'm attracted to her.  Are you?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's sexy.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, we'll talk to her.  Should be great.  Oh.  Can you do this now because Eric can't work to let.  What happened?  The let just shut off on us so they're taking care of it in the back.

On an all-new Sex and the City, radio's Anthony Cumia guest stars as Samantha's chatty cousin, Ophelia.  The guy I was with last night put a horse to shame the size of his cock.  While Samantha undergoes a hysterectomy, Ophelia joins Carrie and the girls for cocktails.  Yes, another round of Cosmos, and one for my pussy, too. 
[01:43:30]  I'm going to do a handstand, just pour it right down the old fuck flu.  If you thought Samantha was the wild one, wait till you hear what Ophelia offers up.  I left the oven mitt stuck taped to my dog's paws.  How embarrassing.  But what a fucking my Labrador gave me.  When these ladies get together for a night on the town, there's no telling what can happen.  You going to buy some shoes?  Yes, the last ones I had are full of cum.  It dripped right down out of my pussy into my shoes.  It's douching and douche chills on an all-new Sex and the City. 
[01:44:00]  Let me see, what day is it?  It's an ass day.  Friday's all about my bunghole.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hold on, let's talk about it on the show here. 
[01:44:30]  What is that, D-Rock?  Is there a reason?  Rock.  No.  Okay, cool.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Yeah.  Ann was giving us the latest info on the Boston Marathon bombing suspect that is alive.  Yeah.  Apparently, when they took him in the boat and there was an exchange of gunfire, as they said, 
[01:45:00]  and they were speculating as to whether he had given himself a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the throat and he couldn't talk.  Well, as more info comes out, he never had a gun on him in that boat.  No gun found.  So what about the self-inflicted gunshot to the throat?  Well, I guess that was done by one of the cops.  Even better.  Yeah, I don't give a shit.  I mean, but it's odd how these stories change.  Also, that exchange of gunfire, he didn't have a gun. 
[01:45:30]  So when did that start?  Who were they shooting at and why?  Did they assume he had a gun?  Probably.  Maybe he did some kind of a movement or something.  I bet they assumed he had a gun, yeah.  Right, right.  But it wasn't an exchange of gunfire.  My question is, what are you supposed to do in that situation?  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's a tricky situation.  It's a very difficult situation.  Why was he bleeding all over the boat, I guess, from the night before?  Yeah, he had been fucked up, I guess, earlier. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  What was his wounds from the night before?  Has that come out yet?  No, that one wound to the throat.  At some point, he got that.  He got a couple more gunshot wounds.  We're not really hearing in detail what was wrong with him.  But another fact that's coming out, they said, you know,  they were talking about the arsenal of weapons  and the fact that he had long guns and assault rifles and everything.  They never had more than that one pistol that they were using. 
[01:46:30]  And where did they get the pistol from?  They're still figuring that out.  Of course, the serial numbers were all ground off of it.  Okay.  There's all the serial numbers that you can't ground off of these days, no?  Yeah, well, you could usually, with some kind of acid test,  or not acid test, procedure, you could bring back up  because the actual stamp of the serial number goes right into the metal.  Gotcha.  But the fact of the matter is, it was probably just an illegal gun  with the serial number scraped off when they bought it from somebody. 
[01:47:00]  They didn't have a license to buy pistols.  But they never had this big arsenal that had been reported.  Wasn't one of them on the watch list, too, that the fucking first one?  Yes, that's another one.  The brother was on a terrorist watch list.  Apparently, since he had been questioned by the FBI,  they kind of thought everything was fine.  So there were never any follow-ups done.  And, I mean, the dirt that's coming through on this guy  and what was known about it is amazing. 
[01:47:30]  And it's one guy.  It's not this big plot, this big conspiracy.  There might be other people involved,  but as far as he goes, you know there's a problem.  You know this guy's a fucking problem.  There wasn't any keeping tabs on him or deporting him.  How many guys out there are a problem,  that they just can't keep tabs on everybody?  Who knows?  No one's very transparent with any of this shit.  And it's true they spelled his name wrong,  and that's how he got kind of stuck through the cracks a little bit? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, they could be in a spelling error, which is great,  because that's all you've got to do, I guess,  is just misspell a couple of things.  Right.  But this gun issue is very odd.  They really made a point of saying there was an arsenal,  and they had had these running gun battles with long rifles.  Heard it on the scanner myself.  You know, they got long guns.  He had a fucking pistol.  They had explosives, though.  Yeah, they did have the...  They were throwing that shit out of the car.  The explosives, the crock pot. 
[01:48:30]  The crock pot.  There's actually a company that stopped selling crock pots.  Why?  Just stopped selling crock pots.  What fucking assholes?  It's called Panicky Pete's Crock Pots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could the crock pot do the same thing that the pressure cooker does?  Or a pressure cooker, sorry.  Oh, okay.  I always get those confused.  Yeah.  A crock pot.  Yeah.  Who cooks in those?  Terrible.  I made a casserole.  I like a good stew. 
[01:49:00]  A good crock pot stew.  Oh, that is good.  Slow cooked.  The Norton household is legendary for crock pot stew.  Really?  That fucking crock pot was never empty in my house.  It does sound good.  You ever had an oxtail stew?  I don't think so, no.  That's a good one.  E-rock-tail stew.  Oh, boy.  But a crock pot bomb would take, what, three days?  It just happened to.  Three days.  It takes three days to detonate.  They placed the bomb and, oh, boy, everyone went home two days ago. 
[01:49:30]  And the stupid glass lid would just blow off of it anyway.  Yeah, the pressure cooker locks, the lid locks on like a hatch.  Fucking CNN just keeps showing that same footage of them trying out the pressure cooker bomb over and over again.  And just showing everybody how impressive it really is.  That's smart.  Yeah, look at this.  This is what it does.  Yeah, it's very dangerous.  I don't know what we're learning from that.  What are we learning from that?  It's very dangerous.  Having CNN, you know, show that video over and over again of them, you know, doing the pressure cooker bomb in the desert. 
[01:50:00]  They also reported that the younger one was in New York City in October, I guess, partying.  And they were going to come down to New York City to just have fun.  Celebrate.  Celebrate, yeah.  Oh, that was it?  Yeah.  No plans.  They haven't had any inkling that they were going to do anything destructive.  Right.  But who knows with them guys.  They might have found a pressure cooker shop and said, ah, let's do it again.  Oof. 
[01:50:30]  And then they're thinking the gunpowder that they got might have been from fireworks.  I saw that.  That they bought.  In New Hampshire.  In New Hamster.  Or, yeah, you could just, you know, roadside fireworks.  You buy up these fucking mortars.  Those big round things that you shove in the tube.  And you empty them out.  You got yourself some gunpowder.  Yep.  Some are saying that the neck or the throat injury was from shrapnel.  From the fucking.  Possibly.  From that, maybe.  Maybe from the flashbang.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[01:51:00]  What is, oh, right.  What is that flashbang that they dropped in there?  What does that do?  Oh, it just fucks up your senses.  It's, they usually throw it in before they, uh, before they enter a room that they're  not sure about or they know that some people are in there.  They throw in a flashbang.  It's a concussion and a bright flash, but without the shrapnel, uh, that comes off of like a  grenade.  So it disorients whoever's in there.  Blinds them.  Makes them deaf.  Makes them deaf for a little bit.  Yeah.  And then you could just come in and fucking put the buddy a rifle over the bridge of their 
[01:51:30]  nose.  It's a motherfucker on the ears.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  You would just be like, you can't see.  Right.  All you're hearing is, and now there's people around you.  Yeah.  You start playing your fucking guitar.  Also, the suspect is in the same hospital as the victims.  Oh yeah.  And you know, family members are just kind of, we've all been, we've all been in hospitals.  Just the old pillow over the face.  You know, you got, you got to kill some time.  So you start wandering around. 
[01:52:00]  I'm sure some family members are doing some wandering.  I bet it's not like the movies.  I bet there's a couple of guys at his door.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  And it's your job to protect that guy.  Yeah.  That's gotta be a motherfucker on your head.  Michael and the fucking Baker.  Yeah.  Come over.  Was it the Baker?  Enzo.  The Baker.  The Baker.  Come and push his fucking bed into another room.  Well, they said that some of the nurses and stuff and the, and the, our doctors were  like not wanting to save this kid.  I mean, they knew they had to, but I think after they were like, what are we doing?  Like, you know, can't wait to get rid of him. 
[01:52:30]  They're like, get him out of this hospital.  We don't want anything to do with him.  Yeah.  I would love to talk to a federal agent.  That's gotta be a, not the greatest fucking job that you, you're the guy that has to  make sure nothing happens to him.  This piece of shit.  Yeah.  This piece of shit.  And if something happens to him, it's going to be your job.  Yeah.  You'd want to go in and maybe turn a few.  Dials, press a few switches, cut off a few tubes.  So that's the latest on, on what's going on up there.  Yeah.  Again, a lot of, um, misinformation that slowly, as time goes on, they say, well, this was what 
[01:53:00]  really happened.  And then a few more days here and this happened.  So it's not this big burst of information that would upset anyone or, or make anyone  think that there's an issue.  It's just let out slowly.  I don't like that at all.  That's what's happening with this Benghazi thing too.  There's another Benghazi investigation that they want to do.  And, um, it's, it seems Hillary made her statement during the first investigation that, um, she knew nothing 
[01:53:30]  about this, uh, ambassador and his team asking for more security.  They asked, they, in a written request, asked for more security at the embassy in Benghazi.  Meanwhile, their, uh, security was actually cut after getting that message.  Hillary said she knew nothing of this.  Her people take care of this.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, lo and behold, there's a memo, um, giving the order to pull back the security at this 
[01:54:00]  embassy signed by Hillary Clinton.  What's her response to that been?  She hasn't responded to it.  But now it doesn't matter because she's out.  She's no longer secretary of state.  So their whole answer will be, well, this was when she was in place.  There is different people now and blah, blah, blah.  No accountability again, again.  Yep.  So they want to have another investigation.  And this is a kind of a big issue for that investigation.  It's why she lied, lied in the first investigation saying she knew nothing of this when her signature 
[01:54:30]  is on the actual paper that, um, came across her desk.  So we'll see where that goes.  But, uh, I tell you, you know, and I know the Republicans and Democrats, I'm not going  to get into an argument back and forth like that because they all have had their bullshit  moments, but I've never seen an administration like this that is so full of shit and so full  of, uh, diversions and fucking, uh, um, where there's still people just blindly following, 
[01:55:00]  uh, Obama.  I mean, it's, it, the, the lack of transparency here, the sweeping under the carpet of, of  actual terrorist events, the downplaying of the Muslim danger, the kissing the ass of  the Saudis.  There's some fucking scandal and it's in between reality and conspiracy right now that the first  guy that they got, that was a Saudi national that we heard about, um, that was then we 
[01:55:30]  was, we were told that he had nothing to do with this is a big wig in the, in Saudi.  And there's some kind of arrangement being made between the Obama administration and  the Saudis to get him out of the fucking country ASAP, like, like, like something's going on  here.  But whenever a question's asked that Carney, the fucking white house speaker, Carney, which  was a great name for him because he just fucking leads the rubes, uh, always has an answer 
[01:56:00]  without giving any answer.  I don't know this administration.  And it's not just that he's black.  It just makes me very fucking nervous.  But obviously the Saudi national had nothing to do with the Boston marathon bombing.  Who knows?  Oh, that's what I'm asking.  No one really knows what this guy is.  I mean, do they grab the wrong guy and realize, oh, fuck, he's a big wig.  And now we pissed off the, the, the Saudis.  That's that why this is going down.  That is one of the things that are being speculated that he did have something to do with it. 
[01:56:30]  At least something to do with the Boston marathon bombing.  People are saying that it's at least maybe conspiracy guys or other guys.  Well, it's a little more than conspiracy guys, but still in that realm.  Right.  Uh, that would come out in the end, wouldn't it?  That's just it.  This administration is brilliant at things not coming out or slowly coming out in different  light later.  And then you just get the blind people that follow and believe.  And it's crazy.  But they're saying maybe this guy in some logistical way had something to do with this. 
[01:57:00]  Maybe, uh, in, in getting, uh, information back and forth from Saudi Arabia, who knows?  But the thing is, we're not hearing anything about it.  Um, and I think they have a record of this guy actually visiting the white house at some  point.  Really?  Yeah.  It's Saudi national.  Let's, uh, talk to Doug in Philly.  He wants to take you on a little bit.  All right.  Doug, what's going on?  You know, fucking Anthony.  Yes.  Listen, you go off on these rants of how, oh, Obama has no accountability, transparency. 
[01:57:30]  You throw cliches and you shout and everyone else sitting in there just sits on their hands.  And Opie does this Sudoku puzzle.  He's writing another book.  Well, go ahead.  I don't just, I just don't have the passion for this like Ant does.  What am I going to do, man?  What are you getting at?  I don't know.  I think they all suck across the board.  I know that's a very easy thing to say, but I can't be bothered with it.  But what's your point? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, what is your point?  You could, uh, you could, go ahead.  You could challenge Anthony.  Go ahead.  So, my point is, you call out the Obama regime, but your buddy boy Bush?  The whole reason we went into the Iraq war was throwing Powell under the bus with the  WMD presentation.  Right.  Exactly.  The biggest blunders of American history.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So, that makes, that makes Obama any more right?  If you listened to us during the Bush administration, we talked about how that was bullshit. 
[01:58:30]  Everyone that supported that talked about how they were bamboozled, and we supported it  at the beginning because of the information, the, the bad information, the lies that were  put out, and then we acknowledged it later.  I wasn't sitting there saying, fuck you, there were WMDs, they took them to Syria.  I wasn't saying that.  I fessed up and said, yes, it was false information that got us into Iraq.  Yes, I agreed. 
[01:59:00]  Does that make what Obama's doing now any better?  Fuck no, but two minutes ago, you just sat there and said, I've never seen a regime as  bad as this.  No, even Bush wasn't as bad as this, sir.  Even Bush was not as bad as covering up shit that's going on and not letting us see what's  going on as much as Obama.  And Obama has not taken blame one for anything.  Bush would get shit on at every turn for everything he did.  Mission accomplished, all that shit, the press jumped on him. 
[01:59:30]  Obama is the fucking golden boy, not a fucking complaint from the press.  He never gets held accountable for anything.  The country's been unemployed for years, nothing.  He's great.  The economy's in the shitter.  Oh, it's Wall Street.  It's this.  It's the Republicans.  It's that.  The sequester.  The Republicans are holding us hot.  This guy is not responsible for the shit state that the country's in.  He's been president for one term, going into his second term, with no light at the end 
[02:00:00]  of the tunnel, and yet I'm supposed to fucking think he's great?  Blow me.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Netflix and dinosaurs.  I made such a haul on Netflix.  Yes, you did.  I didn't do as good with Apple, but you know what?  Yeah.  It was a coin toss, and I could have lost big.  Yeah.  But I wound up just about breaking even on my Apple options, but I got out in time, which  I'm totally happy with.  So you've still got your Netflix profits.  Yeah, and I'm looking for the next kind of stock that's in play, you know?  I want something in play. 
[02:00:30]  And you start to look at more dinosaurs, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking at a Triceratops and an Allosaurus.  Oh, nice.  Doug, anyway, to you.  Anthony's exhausting.  He really is.  You need to start drinking again or something, because I think...  No.  ...he's been nicer this last ten days than he has been in five years.  What are you talking about, you idiot?  You know what you're doing to us?  Am I nice?  Yes.  He's been more pleasant.  He's been a pleasure.  Don't do this, Tushdog.  You have to think he quit drinking in 1985.  Right.  It's only been ten days.  It's been two weeks. 
[02:01:00]  He's been a delight, dare I say.  It's been 14 days.  Yeah.  Anthony's been as peaceful as I've ever seen him.  You know what the problem is, though?  I stopped drinking so I could work out and lose weight and stuff.  But because I stopped, I've been eating ice cream sandwiches and Twizzlers.  That's all right.  You're treating yourself.  You're getting some sweets in.  Oh, because it's like...  That won't kill you.  You're just trying to get your pool body together.  Yes.  I got to get my pool body, my swimmer's figure.  And then when you get the pool body back together, then you're going to go back to 
[02:01:30]  drinking.  No, I don't know.  I'm really kind of looking at this.  I'm giving it the litmus test.  This is strange.  I'm giving it the test like, do the good, does the good outweigh the bads?  And so far, I can't really find a great advantage for drinking a lot.  I can't really find that good advantage.  The advantage to not, I wake up.  It's amazing.  It's fucking amazing to wake up in the morning and not have a headache and not go like, oh 
[02:02:00]  God, I feel like shit.  And it just is kind of...  And then it's like, there's nothing really to it.  You're just sitting there, whether it's a ginger ale or it's club soda and fucking lime  or something.  And I'm just sipping that in a glass with a...  Like, I won't just take a can of soda or something.  Or something like that.  And I'll take a glass.  I'll put ice in it. 
[02:02:30]  I'll mix club soda with some cranberry juice or something.  And then I'll clink, clink the drink and drink that.  And it's really no different.  Because once you get past the initial buzz, you're just...  I never got like more and more drunk.  I'm not one of those kind of drinkers.  I'd reach a point and just kind of maintain it.  So it's kind of like it never really...  Oh, shit!  No, I swear.  I'm actually a pretty coherent drunk.  But like Jimmy said, I do repeat myself and yell a lot.  It's not a violent or angry drunk. 
[02:03:00]  No, I'm a happy drunk.  It's kind of fun.  But there's no advantage to it.  There's none.  No, it's not really.  I'm trying to...  Like, believe me, I do some assessment every day.  I kind of...  I look at what I would be doing and what I'm doing and how I'm feeling and things like that.  And I'm not seeing such a huge advantage in the drinking part.  Do you have the itch?  Yeah, they're like...  So how do you get past the itch? 
[02:03:30]  The same way I do it with smoking.  The same way I do it with anything in life.  Yeah, but you downplay it.  That itch is pretty powerful.  No, it is.  But here's what you do.  What do you do?  You just don't do it!  Because you could probably help people out there.  No, because you need amazing willpower.  You need amazing willpower.  Here's what you do.  So you don't fucking do it.  But you're saying the itch is pretty powerful, but you're able to push it down.  Yeah, because, you know, I like sitting there and drinking a glass of wine at night.  It's great.  But then, you know, you look around and go,  Oh, you know what?  Ah, it would be nice to have... 
[02:04:00]  Nope!  Well, and that's it.  No one's twisting your arm.  No, there's not a voice in your head.  You don't regain consciousness with a glass in your hand or a cigarette in your mouth.  You know you're doing it when you start to do it.  And if you really are committed to not doing something,  just don't fucking do it!  Just don't do it!  But then the itch comes back 15 minutes later.  And again, you don't do it again.  Man, you just fucking...  You've got great willpower.  You've just got to not fucking do it.  You mean I won't have to not go to your house anymore and then knock on the patio door  and see you asleep with a fucking wine in your hand and a gun right by your fucking hand 
[02:04:30]  and worry if I'm going to be fucking shot?  Just for saying hi.  Yeah, knocking and ducking.  I have been known to fall asleep on the couch with a glass of wine in my hand, in my lap.  Have you stained the couch?  Ever?  Yeah, there have been one or two instances where the glass took a little topple  when I might have, you know, leaned over.  And I wake up like, oh, fuck.  Well, you've been a delight the last two weeks.  Oh.  Just a pure delight.  Well, that's good to hear. 
[02:05:00]  But it is nice to not wake up feeling...  It's weird.  That's the biggest part.  You get so used to, like, being in a room where there's these thick cobwebs  and you're just used to wading through them and all of a sudden they're gone.  It's like, wow, it feels better.  That's the biggest part.  At Amy Schumer's thing, I had a jalapeno margarita.  That sounds good.  And I didn't enjoy it.  No.  And it was just one strong drink and then I did have, like, a half a beer after that.  I feel, like, just blah today.  Like, ugh today. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a lightweight.  I didn't enjoy it.  It's just, you know...  It sounded good at the time, but...  It just can't.  I don't know.  Believe me, I sure enjoy a good drink.  But, you know, you got...  What am I going to do?  How did he say the bombers were on welfare?  That is true.  At least the one that's dead, he was on welfare.  Yeah.  He was on welfare and his wife was working, like, 60, 80 hours a week.  Really?  While he did his thing.  Working the system?  He was just a hunk of fucking shit. 
[02:06:00]  Working the system.  He's a hunk of shit.  Yeah.  A hunk of shit.  Yeah, I don't fucking...  There's a lot...  There's just a lot of shit going on.  Oh, by the way, there's people that obviously agree with you.  This guy says...  Yeah, yeah.  That just makes for...  Yeah, you're not going to...  Not boring radio.  I shouldn't say that, but...  Anthony stands strong.  You're the only person who speaks the truth.  That's Jim Jersey.  Oh, I certainly am.  Okay.  And then the next thing you see is, Anthony's an asshole blowhard. 
[02:06:30]  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  Anthony keeps talking the truth.  Anthony knows nothing.  He's a dick.  Stick to telling dick jokes.  All right.  Yeah.  They're wonderful, aren't they?  You gotta love them all, don't you?  The ricin guy was on CNN.  Holy fuck.  Uncle Ben?  Yeah, ricin beans, cocksucker.  Fucking hilarious.  I know.  Fucking wordplay, Yuma.  Yuma. 
[02:07:00]  CNN had a great interview with the ricin guy.  The guy that they let go, right?  And he did have a...  When they were asking if he had any ricin at home, he did say, well, ricin.  Yeah, yeah, ricin.  He didn't even know what ricin was.  They just had the wrong guy.  Yep.  And it was a great interview yesterday on CNN.  The wrong guy, because his initials matched a letter.  That's all it was?  Pretty much.  But it was intense, and they fucking...  The Elvis guy or no?  Yeah, it was the Elvis guy.  Oh, he didn't do it?  He didn't do it.  Oh, good.  Okay.  They let him go, and he did interviews saying, like, yeah, well... 
[02:07:30]  It was intense, because they didn't believe him at all.  Because he kept going, what's this about?  And they're like, you know what this is about.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  The guy is a little nutty.  Well, yeah, that's why we want to play this clip.  Yeah.  Because then he tried to spin it.  Because he's like, what the fuck?  If I'm getting all this attention, I'm going to get something out of it.  Yeah.  Except he had to have this happen the same week as A.J. Clemente.  Ah.  Who's taking all of his...  Took his heat.  All of his weirdo heat is being taken by A.J.  Weirdo heat.  Yeah.  A.J. Clemente, he's done. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't even make it till Friday.  No, he's done.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  And then he'll be calling us, like, you know what?  I do have a little extra time while I'm in New York.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah, we played the clip from Letterman.  We got the info.  That's right.  We don't need you anymore.  But the racing guy, listen to this.  You know, any kind of...  Anytime there's a conspiracy of any sort, it can either do one of two things.  It can destroy you, or it can thrust you into the limelight and make you successful. 
[02:08:30]  I've seen pieces of television shows where somebody was taken from their home and falsely  arrested and something happened and no one knew who they were.  They might have been a lawnmower repairman.  And the next thing you know, they are in Washington performing for the president.  But, you know, so, I mean, this thing could flip.  No more repairman.  Mm-hmm.  I need an ambulance or a hearse.  I killed Doyle.  This guy sounds a little wacky. 
[02:09:00]  I like his accent.  He was the Elvis impersonator.  Oh, it gets better.  It gets better.  He's more than just an Elvis impersonator.  For the president.  You know, so, I mean, this thing could flip, and I could become the next best thing since  sliced bread.  And I could get a record deal, publish my book, and take my kids to Disneyland.  You know, that's the way I'm looking at it from a positive standpoint. 
[02:09:30]  We wish you well.  And in the interest of your rehabilitation, if you want to give me a little taste of what  you got as an impersonator, I'm willing to let you do it before I go to break.  What do you got?  One of my favorite fellows in the world is Randy Travis.  I just like him as a person, so I'll give you a little of that.  On one hand, I count the reasons I could stay with you and hold you close to me all night  long. 
[02:10:00]  So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you.  On that hand, there's no reason why it's wrong.  But on the other hand, there's a golden band.  And it reminds me of someone who would not understand. 
[02:10:30]  On one hand, I could stay.  Thank you very much.  That's pretty good, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know a little bit about Randy Travis.  He's pretty close.  In the booming world of Randy Travis impersonators, he made me the best one.  He nailed it.  Absolutely.  Too bad if he didn't think you could do stupid Travis, then he would have done fucking Travis  Teft.  It's pretty good, though.  He's not going to get a lot of work as a Randy Travis impersonator. 
[02:11:00]  That's the problem.  You got to figure out.  Yeah.  Stick with Elvis.  Yeah.  Stick with Elvis.  You know, I do a little Elvis, but Randy Travis is where I shine.  He blew it right there.  He could have been an Elvis thing.  He would have gotten offers for fucking, you know, maybe a wedding.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yo, the wiener's saying that there might be more pictures out there.  Anthony Wiener.  The wiener.  Throwing his hat in the ring for, I guess, mayor.  He wants to run for mayor.  So he's mounting a comeback.  He's back on Twitter.  And in an interview, he's saying that, hey, look, I made a mistake. 
[02:11:30]  I've got the picture out there.  And by the way, might be one or two more floating around out there.  If someone, you know, comes to the table, I'm not going to say that they're not out there.  It could be.  But if they do surface, let's just keep it like it was, you know.  Let's just chalk it up to what I did and look toward the future.  He's finally owning it.  Yeah.  Instead of coming up with some far out excuse.  And the whole fucking his answer, though, because I heard they were like, you know, well, why did you do it? 
[02:12:00]  And he's like, I don't know.  It was a mistake.  I have conversations with people.  And I just after an hour of talking with them, I can't I can't give them a good enough answer as to why I did this.  I just don't know.  Bullshit.  You try to get fucking laid.  That's the only reason guys send dick pics.  Of course.  Is to try to fuck the receiver of said dick pic.  Or just be dirty.  Like, maybe even if you're not intending on fucking them, because I've had plenty.  You want to be in case of emergency break glass.  Fuck, though.  It's like you don't send dick pics to someone and think you you would never fuck them. 
[02:12:30]  If the opportunity comes up, you'll fuck them.  It's at least some jerk fodder.  Right.  Something.  But that's what he's doing it for.  Some kind of sexual satisfaction.  I was watching all the interviews, just praying that at some point he would be like, and those goddamn Openy and Anthony and they put my picture out there.  Oh, someone was going to do it.  You're going to try to ruin his political career this time?  Well, half of half of the New York media saw that picture. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Brie Barton.  Everyone's showing that around.  Or Brie Barton.  Whatever you want to say.  I don't know.  Huh?  Half the media saw that picture, but then you guys made sure that everybody else did.  Well, remember Barbara Walters all pissed off?  I saw that.  I wish I could do her.  She was all pissed.  Like, I also saw that picture.  Just so you know, they weren't the first ones.  Calm down, Babs.  Yeah, exactly.  You have to get every scoop.  How many scoops can one lady get?  Yeah, we got it. 
[02:13:30]  You saw the picture.  Fine.  We'll share the scoop with you, Babs.  Boy, she can't let anybody have a moment in the sun, can she?  The Opie and Anthony show is shining.  What does she do?  She has to put that raisin face in.  Excuse me, I had it first.  All right, fine, Babs.  Scoops all yours.  I had it first.  I had it first.  Don't most kids get rid of that by, like, fucking six or seven? 
[02:14:00]  Three.  Three.  Try three.  Cleft, all cleft lip diction.  Well, this is Anthony Weiner talking about it.  Are there other acts that you haven't described, either to your wife, to yourself, to your family, to the voters?  Well, look, I've told every single thing to my wife in excruciating, painful detail.  Those are conversations that are very necessary but very, very difficult.  I've tried to answer every question, you know. 
[02:14:30]  Some of it I must confess.  You know, people say it to me all the time.  I say, hey, Anthony, what were you thinking?  A lot of the time when I was doing these things, I really wasn't thinking.  Oh, stop.  You know, I've done my best to kind of figure out exactly how many people I might have sent something inappropriate to.  Oh, good for that.  I've got to be as honest as I possibly could.  Is there more stuff out there?  Well, look, some of these people who are at the other end of these things, their lives have been turned upside down.  Some of them have come forward willingly and shared things.  I can tell you that some things may come out that are true, some things are not. 
[02:15:00]  But here's where I'm going to be.  Oh, oh.  Basically, New Yorkers know the story.  I did it.  I did it with multiple people.  These things were wrong and inappropriate, and I never should have been dishonest about them.  They played out in the most public, embarrassing way possible.  And that's it.  That's what people need to know, and that's where I stand, and I own that.  Completely, and it's something that I'm going to have to work through for a very long time.  Now, this is very interesting. 
[02:15:30]  You think this will work for him?  No.  We cannot have Mayor Dick pick.  They will not elect him.  But we always bitch and complain when these guys aren't being honest.  I mean, he has nothing to lose.  Just to completely own it and be as honest as possible.  Politics are a different animal, though.  I agree with you, by the way.  Unless you're black, of course.  Then you can do anything, and your constituency will re-elect you.  Wrangle!  No!  But, yeah, Charlie Crook Wrangle and fucking Crackhead.  Something to be said for that, though. 
[02:16:00]  I don't agree with Marion Barry, but there's something to be said for black voters.  I mean, maybe they're voting for him because he's black, but they don't...  Of course they are.  Not a maybe.  But meaning, they don't give a shit if you go out and fuck someone.  They're not fucking babies about that.  Yeah, but it's not usually fucking.  It's usually corruption and horrible mismanagement.  That's bad.  And bad fucking politics.  Which is way worse than what the wiener was doing.  Like fucking Jesse Jackson Jr.  He had to check into a loony bin to try to get himself out of trouble.  And he still couldn't. 
[02:16:30]  And they still re-elected him.  Yeah.  Yes!  From the mental pot!  Holy fuck!  No, I don't think he has a shot, but it's very interesting that he's like, fuck it, I have nothing to lose, so I'm going to be extremely honest here.  He's going to try.  We'll see how it plays out.  I think it works for him that he won't be elected mayor, but he'll get his face out there enough where people might hear what he has to say and, you know, listen to his policies for the next election or something. 
[02:17:00]  The Twitter pussy was probably drying up.  Oh, yeah.  He's got to get back on the news, back behind the podium.  And now he can send new cockpicks out, because he can be like, oh, I must have sent that one a whole bunch of years ago.  How can you?  There's a fucking, there's a January 2013 post under it.  New episode of Game of Thrones on the TV behind it.  Yeah, he's just waving his fucking prick.  He's angrily grabbing his prick.  His new Twitter handle, his mayor boy is back, waving his fucking prick. 
[02:17:30]  I love this guy.  Vote for me!  I'll show you my fucking prick.  That's the big fucking bumper sticker.  Wouldn't that be great?  Yeah.  That was it.  I voted for Wiener.  I love his fucking prick.  Just dirty.  He went totally the opposite way.  Yeah.  Yeah, during every debate, he just kept interrupting.  Yeah, how big is your prick?  You've seen how big my fucking prick is.  He steps out from the podium and his prick's out.  He won't even sit there grabbing it.  And he shakes it back and forth.  Get a picture!  He won't even do a play on his name. 
[02:18:00]  He's too vulgar for that.  Yes.  That's too innocent and cute.  Yeah, hey, so you think you're a head wiener?  He goes, yeah, and I got some big balls under my fucking prick.  Democrats and Republicans, they're like, two balls.  And what am I?  A big fucking prick right here.  He just owns it and goes ballistic, and he tries to get that fucking fringe vote.  That's funny.  I would love that.  He only wears...  Every time he shows up for debate, it's in, like, white spandex with no underpants. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  And he won't stand behind the podium.  See the outline?  Yeah, he just kind of casually leans on it, like, on his fucking side, so you have to  look at the head.  And he's half hard all the time.  Always half hard.  And he fucking...  Because, you know, he has a cock ring on to fucking push it out.  Got a plump half rod.  Yeah, and he'll fucking fidget with it while he's talking.  Fidget?  What's that cock ring all about?  Cock rings are great.  I've worn them a couple times, but it really does make your dick angry.  I've never, never tried one.  No, I've never worn a cock ring.  Yeah, they're pretty good, man.  Really?  Yeah, it's like your whole body's like... 
[02:19:00]  Your whole dick is all fucking...  It's like, yeah, fucking...  What's his name?  E.G. Wells or whatever?  E.G. Wells.  E.G. Robinson.  Edward Robinson.  It keeps that shit hard?  Yeah.  Doesn't it fucking hurt to keep it hard for so long?  Well, the problem is I've tried one with a snap, which I didn't like, and then there  was one...  Edward G.  That's it.  Edward G.  And then there was one that just picks you like a little O-ring, just like a ring, a snug  rubber ring, and you put it over your dick and balls, but you have to make sure that...  Do you have to work your balls in one at a time? 
[02:19:30]  I mean, do your balls throw it?  Well, it expands.  It's not made of fucking steel.  Yeah, but if it expands enough to get it around your balls, how elastic could it be to squish  around your...  It works.  Yeah.  It's a kind of space-age polymer.  And you put it around your dick and balls.  The only problem is, occasionally, you have to make sure...  Like, what you gotta do is, when you put your dick and balls through it, you have to just  kind of, like, adjust it so none of your skin is, like, mushed uncomfortably, but then  it's pretty cool.  Yeah.  And then you can just jump up and down.  You take a Cialis and do one of those.  I just jump up and down, and I'll just go, yay!  Look at my fucking prick! 
[02:20:00]  You think Dr. Steve's up?  Yeah.  Ah.  What, do you got a question?  Hope so.  I gotta ask him about vagina stretching.  Why?  What?  Yeah.  Why?  What's this about?  It has nothing to do with anyone close to me.  No, no, I'm just wondering what it is.  Oh, man.  I'm trying to rename my fist to that, so I'll steal this.  Well, I could...  Oh, write it down. 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  I love these.  I swear, no one in my family or extended family, but...  Let's see.  Please don't say this.  No, no, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  But how do you...  Okay, hold on.  All right.  Yeah.  Sharpie writing.  Wait a minute.  Oh, boy. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, no, this is a lot of writing.  What?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Yeah.  First of all, how do you even hear about that?  Did that just come up in conversation?  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's having that done.  Yeah.  Well, I could say all this.  Of course.  Just the person you know.  The person...  Yeah.  Fringe.  Who you've interacted with.  Interacted with. 
[02:21:30]  This person stretches her five-year-old's vagina.  Her five-year-old daughter.  She stretches it every day.  Sure.  You got to get in there.  She stretches it.  Yeah.  That is not anything I've ever heard of.  All right.  I got to talk to Steve.  That is absolutely...  Yeah.  Well, that's why I'm bringing it up because...  Gotta be abuse.  We were kind of creeped out by this conversation.  Yeah.  This is all I want to say.  All right.  Without giving too much away.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, Jesus.  Dr. Steve. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Someone I've interacted with told a story how she stretches her five-year-old daughter's vagina  every morning.  Okay.  I guess the daughter was born with a closed vagina?  Yeah.  Vaginal atresia, probably.  Vaginal atresia.  Vaginal atresia?  What's that?  Is that like vaginal shrubberia?  No, Chip.  A tree.  We were horrified when this story was being told. 
[02:22:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  And all I was thinking was, I got to call Dr. Steve.  I was busy yesterday.  I would have called you, you know, off air.  But, um, supposedly her daughter was born with vaginal, what is it?  Atresia.  Punch that up there.  Vaginal atresia.  Punch vaginal atresia.  And what does that mean?  Like, the opening isn't fully open?  Right.  She was born with a too small vagina.  Ew.  And you've heard, have you heard of?  Oh, God. 
[02:23:00]  I don't want to see it.  Damn it.  Fuck.  Let me see it.  Ew.  It's just, it's like, it's, it's.  Wait.  It's like a Barbie doll.  Wait, there's a lot of shit on this screen right now.  I know.  I don't want to.  Ah, boy.  That's my home page.  We're looking at the upper fucking right hand bloody.  That.  All right.  But what's that blob over there?  I don't know.  Eric.  And why is there.  Oh, you don't have to shut the curtains for vaginal atresia.  Yeah.  No, you don't. 
[02:23:30]  We don't.  And what about the hair lift kid?  Why is that on the same page?  I don't know.  It's vaginal atresia.  Atresia.  As the vaginal atresia kid.  Stretch it.  It gets worse, though.  As they get older, they'll use vaginal dilator.  Won't get worse for us, though, huh, guys?  Yeah, nice and tight.  Yeah.  My mother used to call it cunt stretching.  What's, what's, what's the dilator?  Well, uh, they're, they look like, I guess, little dildo things. 
[02:24:00]  And you, they, you insert them larger and larger and larger.  And what they used to do now, when I, this was 25 years ago, I don't know if they're still  doing this now, but they would have a bicycle seat that had this vaginal stretcher on it.  And the girl would have to, you know, straddle it and sit on it.  Oh, wow.  I have one of those in my living room.  That's got to fuck them up psychologically.  But it's also so they have a normal vagina, right?  It helps them.  Right.  Right.  That's the, that's the goal. 
[02:24:30]  Why can't there be a little surgery where you do a little, uh, you know, make the, you  know, slit the slit.  Because doesn't, like, if they grow, the cunt grows.  It's not like, it's not like there's a fully formed vagina and it's just sealed off and  all they need to do is open it up.  The whole vagina itself is too small.  Right.  And there's not much of an opening on top of it.  Exactly.  So basically they're trying to open the whole cunt tube.  So. 
[02:25:00]  You want to stretch the cunt tube.  Right.  Right.  But Dr. Steve, so this person told us this and said that she's stretching it every morning.  So how do you think she's stretching it?  Like the way you're saying it?  I think you're going to dial it up.  Ah, dial it up.  Oh my God.  You start with a Chang Wang and you end up with a Mandingo.  Hey, we got, we got a woman on the line that was born with vaginal atresia.  Oh, nice.  Let's talk to her.  Lonely. 
[02:25:30]  You're on line one.  Hey, Karen.  Oh.  Well, I was only lonely in my teen years.  Oh, piccolo pussy.  Karen.  That vaginal atresia is all I had.  Now that that's fixed, I'll never feel the walls, Karen.  All right, Karen.  What did you do?  I used to, um, okay, this is the most bizarre part.  I was born in, uh, 70.  Barn?  So the treatments were different then.  Right.  And, uh, you remember the little, um, things you could get and they were like nasal sniffers. 
[02:26:00]  They were like white tubes.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I still, I just got one recently.  They were like Vicks.  Uh, you, you put them.  Yes.  I learned things.  Okay.  My mother, for as long as I can remember, I used to have to use that thing like three  and four times a day.  And what happened was my vaginal walls.  Think about like, okay, you guys work out.  If you get a charley horse in your calf, that's what the inside of my vagina felt like all the time. 
[02:26:30]  Oh man.  So wait a minute.  You would have to use this little thing.  And then what would you do afterwards?  Would you realize that someone finally tell you in your teen years that your vagina was not congested?  That wasn't the problem?  Is she trying to blow her vagina?  It's a little sniffly vagina.  You go through a series of dilators and it increases as your body grows.  But before I got married and I was brought up really religious, I had an arranged marriage when I was 18.  Oh wow.  Wait, wait.  That's a story in itself. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  I was brought up in like the Westboro Baptist Church kind of situation.  Oh boy.  Oh wow.  That doesn't mean that I am that today.  I'll actually say my cunt is dysfunctional.  Oh wow.  Is it better?  Is your cunt better now?  It is extremely tight for a woman of my age.  How old are you?  I'm in my 40s and even after giving birth, it was like I was a virgin again.  You gave vaginal birth?  No way.  Wow.  Do you want to try to open that thing up a little bit? 
[02:27:30]  Jesus.  Would you give birth to a snake?  He had some Mrs. Ball on the phone.  How awful was the head when it came out?  How squishy was it?  Well, first off, I was completely knocked out and my episiotomy went all the way.  Toward neck.  You know what the episiotomy is.  Is that when they sliced the vag?  Oh yeah.  The kid came out like it was in a Play-Doh fun factory.  Wow. 
[02:28:00]  The joke I think was, does he look like somebody with rectal cancer shit?  I did have that.  Wow.  That was like a little fun joke around the house?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  You guys really go for broke with the humor in that family.  But no, it really is a real thing.  And before I got married, I had to go to a class and then do physical therapy and actually  learn how to dilate myself with a dildo.  And I still have that dildo to this day.  Oh, sweet. 
[02:28:30]  You guys, we got to see one of these, man.  So it does look like a tiny vagina?  No, it looks like a regular, like, like dildo.  It was a dildo.  No, your vagina.  No, your vagina.  No, your vag.  Is your vagina really?  What are your ears sewn up to?  What does your vagina look like when you sit back and you spread your legs open?  What does it look like compared to a normal vagina?  Does it look like Jackie Chan winking?  Can I compare it to the Dixon Tornopolis?  It looks like it's much smaller and it's really, it's much thinner in the slit. 
[02:29:00]  Much thinner?  Really?  Yeah, you don't have like, it doesn't look like, hello.  Now, I probably know the answer to this, but could you possibly send us a picture of it?  Oh, man.  So we can look at it?  That'd be nice.  I'm a little old to be doing that.  Nah, you're never too old.  I'm a little old to be doing that.  It looks like a balloon when you pull it and it goes.  You know, when you pull the neck of a balloon. 
[02:29:30]  That's what our queefs sound like.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it's funny.  Oh, wow.  Thank you for calling in, though, Harmonica Box.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you for the call.  That was really interesting.  Thank you, Karen.  Jesus.  That was terrific.  Karen's a good sport.  Wow, Dr. Steve, all right.  I feel better now, because, you know, when you hear that someone is stretching their 
[02:30:00]  five-year-old's vagina every morning.  Well, no, that wasn't the problem.  It was the fact that she charges other people to come in and stretch his vagina.  That's a money-making venture.  It sure is.  Old piggy bank box.  I just went from never talking to this person again to, all right, I guess it's something  you've got to do.  I went just the opposite.  It creeped us out when she said it, because this person, you know, she might not, you  know, English might not be her first language on top of it, so it makes it like, what the 
[02:30:30]  fuck is going on in your house?  At least there's fixing it, though.  That's like the equivalent of a guy with a small dick.  And if a guy's got a small dick, he's just fucked.  There's nothing he can do about it.  Right, Sam?  Oh, Sam.  I think phomosis is not the same thing as what Dr. Steve is describing.  Hey, we got a guy that banged a chick with vaginal atresia.  Oh, he says his buddy banged.  How do you say it again?  Atresia.  Atresia.  Vaginal atresia.  Yo, atresia.  We're my sister atresia. 
[02:31:00]  Say, because it sounds black.  Yo, Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  So this chick in college, real, real petite girl, she was actually a sorority chick, so  she actually got her on the block a little bit, but this real petite girl used  to date my buddy, who was actually a black guy, a sin, I know, because he was white  and he was black.  Oh, boy.  But he was like, every time he tried to have sex, he'd always push me away, and the only  thing I would ever get into her was just the tip of it, and he goes, it wasn't even fucking  worth it, so he just used to tell her to blow him. 
[02:31:30]  Well, because you're a black guy, every girl he dates feels like they have vaginal atresia.  Every girl tries to push him away, too.  Yeah, exactly.  With her hands or the mace.  Yo, that motherfucking mace don't taste good.  But, Jimmy, like you said, he was like, I used to go down on the chick, and it literally  looked like Jackie Chan's twin thing.  Oh, wow.  Dr. Steve.  Yes.  I did once have a girl that I hit the back wall way too soon.  Is that the same thing?  Well, everybody's built differently.  You know, there's a continuum of vaginal sizes, and she may just have been on the low 
[02:32:00]  end.  Yeah, because, like, if I try to go in further, it was extremely uncomfortable.  I was hitting the back wall.  Huh?  It could have been, you know, she could have, and, you know, she just didn't tell you about  it, sure.  Nothing better than hitting that fucking IUD.  Feels like your dick's getting tased.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, what the fuck?  Ow!  Ah!  Here's your cock hole.  That little fishing lure.  It's great.  I'm fucking, you know, they're trying to hook me. 
[02:32:30]  All right, Dr. Steve, we got a whiz and all that shit.  We got a lot of guests coming through now.  Bobby's coming in.  He's outside the studio.  I see Bobby.  We got Ronda Rousey coming in.  Yeah, Ronda Rousey's coming in.  Oh, she is amazing.  I love her.  And then Chos St. Pierre is coming in.  Chos St. Pierre.  Yeah, one of the best fighters in the history of UFC.  Dr. Steve, you got a plug for the show?  Yeah, Weird Medicine.  Better night at 9 p.m.  Saturday at 9. 
[02:33:00]  And I love Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, are you jelly that we got all these great guests coming in?  Yeah.  I'm jelly.  Are you jelly?  Oh.  Yeah, I have the guest, the guy with multiple penis tattoos on his arm.  And you guys have, did you hang up on me?  No.  No.  Right here.  Right here.  Did you hang up on me?  I fell for it again.  No, not today, William.  No.  Yeah, all right, Steve.  All right, we'll see you.  All right, Steve. 
[02:33:30]  Dr. Steve, everyone.  Weird Medicine.  Oh, that was a bad one.  Weird Medicine.  Oh, God.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show, The Sex Bagel battles his demons.  Everything could be, everything could be saved if you come in and take a shot.  When he throws a celebration for himself.  Tequila Day was my idea.  But when things go wrong, E-Rock gets personal.  I can come with a woman.  You can't.  And the things that usually help no longer do the trick. 
[02:34:00]  Maybe I need a donut.  Humiliating his friends, family, and his wife.  I didn't grab her tits.  No.  I don't think she's proud of this particular show.  Then insulting his radio idol.  Oh, turn it off.  Give your final sign-off.  Go home.  No one needs you.  E-Rock's years of radio training go down the drain.  9.08, 8...  Try it again.  9.08, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock.  Just like a chandelier, I'm hooked on the ceiling.  Here's hooked on a feeling. 
[02:34:30]  And awful cliches are used improperly.  A lot to go home.  We may get the truth.  And I know, I know that he doesn't like me.  But when humiliation sets in, the sex man's emotions become out of control.  I don't even know that I'm crying.  Sexy B learns a lesson the hard way.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Morning BJs.  The Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[02:35:00]  Get my money, buy my medicine, buy my medicine, buy my medicine, buy my medicine.  Get my money, buy my medicine, buy my medicine, buy my medicine.  Yeah.  You know I got to have that medicine.  That prescription medicine, baby.  You know, purple, orange, green.  Jack starts hanging around with the fiends.  Guy strung down, saw the cow for beans.  Told young wifey, I love your honey. 
[02:35:30]  But you got to hit the street store, get my money.  Get my money, buy my medicine, buy my medicine, buy my medicine.  Get my money, buy my medicine, buy my medicine, buy my medicine.  Yeah, the more dedicated, the more medicated.  Can you feel me?  Girl, my love's gonna last just as long as my heart.  And I'm high all day, every day.  You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, I lie sometimes.  What's the use of the truth if you can't tell a lie sometimes, baby?  Now dig this.  Jack starts a track up and down the hill.  Got to walk a figure, ace what he told the jail.  Come rain, come shine, come snow all the sudden.  Get the fuck out, girl, and get my money.  Get my money, buy my medicine, buy my medicine, buy my medicine.  Get my money, buy my medicine, buy my medicine, buy my medicine. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, they say you can't buy me love, but you damn sure can buy me blood.  Girl, my love's gonna last just as long as my heart.  Yeah, but we just like this song.  I love this song.  We're listening.  I got turned on to this song yesterday.  No, we're back.  Snip Lion is going to be in today, not our room.  God, why?  Don't know.  I think he's out of 11.  Oh.  But I want to snip.  Snip Lion.  Snip Lion.  How was Alan Alda yesterday?  You watched the, um.  Oh, God.  I watched Ronnie's masterful interview. 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  Really good.  I mean, they talked a lot about science because Alda's huge on science.  That's what he's, isn't he promoting like he was named, uh.  Probably.  He, uh, what was named after him?  Uh, I think a moon.  Some, no.  Some kind of place.  A science place.  Oh.  It was named.  Oh, I thought.  The Alan Alda science place.  Oh, I thought he got a star named after him.  Nah.  Nah.  That's pretty impressive, though.  He's really into science, apparently.  And he, he really loves those guys.  Yes.  And Ronnie, Ronnie did a great, fun interview. 
[02:37:30]  And Alda was fucking hilarious.  Yeah?  Dude, he's hilarious.  His timing is unbelievable.  He makes fun of himself in his own, like, he calls himself arrogant and pot.  Like, you know what I mean?  He just, he knows who the fuck he is.  He knows he's Alan Alda.  How old is he?  I think 71.  That's it, huh?  So I watched from, uh, the little room on the side there.  Yes.  And, uh, he actually walked back in there.  I was such a, I walked out to say hello to John Jones because he was leaving.  And then, of course, I missed Alan walking in.  So I, I trailed in and, uh, Alan, Al. 
[02:38:00]  First of all, you missed his age by six years.  How old is he?  77.  Oh, my God.  He's 77?  And, uh, he's been married since 1957.  No way.  Yeah, his wife Arlene, the same woman.  No way.  He's got three daughters.  He's, he's a very, very liberal pro-woman guy.  He loves women.  From 57?  That's 56 years ago?  He's been married 56 years?  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  He got married at 21?  I guess so.  And he's with the same chick?  He went through all that MASH time where every woman wanted to fuck him? 
[02:38:30]  He would have, I think he would either fly home on the weekends or fly out to see her.  I read something about him when he was doing MASH and he would miss his wife when he was  there.  He's just, he's one of those guys.  He just loves being married, loves his wife.  Good for him.  That's one of those couples where if one dies, the other one dies like a week later.  Yeah.  You know, those couples, like ducks.  So, uh, he came in the back and I chatted with him briefly.  Uh, he was signing a couple things and, uh, I asked, uh, I think I said something about  how do you take dialogue?  I had to ask him an acting question. 
[02:39:00]  I'm like, how do you take dialogue that you see or a written word and just make it yours?  Huh?  Yeah.  What?  Yes!  You do it!  Yes!  But he's such a great, you never feel like Alan Alda's acting.  It always looks like he just showed up and is talking because he's so natural.  Uh-huh.  And I forget what his answer was because I was still like, it's Alan Alda, it's Alan Alda.  Oh, you could barely listen to him, right?  But he said it was hard.  He said it's hard sometimes because a lot of it's not written, like people speak and  you got to kind of, I'm like, will you change words at all?  He said, I try not to.  I try to keep it true to what they wrote, but he said, don't ever say it the way you 
[02:39:30]  think you want them to say.  He actually gave a pretty good explanation.  What amazes me when you watch good acting is a fucking head move or an eye thing or  a, like a twitch, like, like, you could stand there and read lines and actually make it  sound convincing that you're reading, but it's these little movements of the head, like  you look away from the person and then look back and deliver the rest of the line.  Like, who the fuck, how do you know to do that?  Not just stare at the guy, hi, I'm here to deliver the pizza! 
[02:40:00]  It's gotta be natural.  It's called business.  Huh?  They call it business.  The business of show?  No, when you're doing shit like that.  Yeah, I'm gonna pick up the pen right now and twitch my eye and make my hand do this.  You know, is that Vince D'Anafrio?  Yeah.  A lot of business.  A lot of business in his acting?  I did the Law and Order with him and he stole my business.  He stole your business?  When I walked in, every time we rehearsed a scene, I put my hand on his shoulder and  I looked at him to deliver my line.  That was my business.  My hand is going on your shoulder.  All right.  So the first take, when I came in, he put his hand on my shoulder. 
[02:40:30]  Motherfucker.  He stole my business.  Because he probably hated that you were doing that.  No, he's that guy.  He does weird little finger movements.  Pile.  Those little things.  Every take is different.  There's like, how would you know that that line needs you to suck something out of your  tooth in the middle of it?  So, yeah, we're thinking of going to Texas and then going to head to Oklahoma.  How the fuck do you know to do that?  Robert Duvall does a lot of that. 
[02:41:00]  Like, he grinds his teeth.  Yeah.  Who else does?  Hey, Pacino does a lot of hands.  Why is your chair so high?  What do you mean?  It's the way I sit.  What are you doing?  That's how I sit.  He's in the high chair.  What are you doing?  How high up Jimmy is.  That's how I sit.  This is how you've been sitting?  I'm tired of being a shrimpo.  He lifted his chair up, his office type chair up.  He's so much higher than us right now.  I want Rhonda to think that I'm a powerful or a guy that she might be interested in. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, Rhonda, what's up?  Oh, Iraq, yes.  That's how he was sitting at the Alinalda taping.  Really?  He had his hands folded on his lap and he was kicking his legs like a little kid.  Yeah, your feet are way off the ground.  Yeah, of course they are.  You metaphorically?  Yes.  Yeah, it was really cool to watch Alinalda.  Cool.  I got to ask Bobby about this, to retell the story he told us at the Amy Schumer premiere.  I was dying, man.  I had the...  Obviously, you're very close to having a kid.  Month and a week away.  So you're in the it could happen today zone. 
[02:42:00]  I hope it does.  I'm going away.  I got one more week where I'm away.  I just don't want to have one of my friends.  I don't want Norton.  Dude, everything's all right, dude.  Don't miss, Nick.  Dude, everything's good.  And I go to the hospital and the kid grabs my finger.  Da-da.  Da-da.  No, no.  The first smile the boy has is at me.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Then he goes...  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  I have him chipping by the time he gets home.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Like when he's crying.  Da-da. 
[02:42:30]  Da-da.  Da-da.  I go...  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Da-da.  His first little smile is up at me.  I put my finger there and he just grabs it.  And he can't smile unless I'm there.  So the Kellys have to put in a picture of me over the fucking crib like in the mobile.  Calm the kid down when he's feeling right.  Whatever it is.  Bobby's in training, though.  Bobby's getting ready for the babies.  Yes, he is.  All sorts of stuff is going on.  Baby classes and whatnot.  Well, I didn't want to go to baby classes.  I don't like going.  Other couples annoy me. 
[02:43:00]  They want to be friends.  And so she hired this doula to come to your house.  A doula.  That's what they call them, doulas.  Yeah, what are you fighting with swords or something?  Jesus.  That was the first chip that I almost didn't mind.  It's terrible.  So what's the doula do?  She comes in.  Walks you through what to expect.  She walks you through from now until after the baby comes out. 
[02:43:30]  All the crazy vagina stuff.  And she had like...  First of all, she walks in.  She's one of the most beautiful human beings I've ever seen.  Black, mulatto, like Cosby kid.  The good looking one.  You lost Anthony five seconds.  No kidding.  She was gorgeous.  Just different genetics than me and my wife.  Like we're sitting lower in our chair.  Our shoulders are humped over.  This girl was unbelievable.  She sits down and she... 
[02:44:00]  A mula doula.  She takes out all her gear and she goes through all this stuff.  Jesus.  And then she grabs my wife.  She's like, okay, we're going to do some exercises, some massages.  So she puts my wife...  My wife's in...  She's in yoga pants and like a t-shirt.  And she gets on the couch and she goes, okay, you get on all fours.  So she puts my wife on all fours.  On my couch.  A very small apartment.  Sure, sure.  It's not like we have a yoga room.  So now you got this hot chick and your wife's on all fours. 
[02:44:30]  I got this chick behind...  She gets on her knees behind my wife.  Of course.  And I'm sitting up...  My junk is up my wife's head.  What have we got here?  Then she grabs my wife's...  The sides of her hips and her ass.  Sure.  And she starts like massaging but opening and like...  What the fuck is going on?  I'm not kidding, dude.  My wife is...  She's opening up your wife's butt.  Yeah, butt.  But, correct?  Yeah, just every...  Like just opening it.  Sure.  Like techniques I used when I was like 17, 18. 
[02:45:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Like when you saw Prince Napolone, like...  Oh, yeah.  We were massage chicks.  Yeah.  And my wife's like, that feels good.  And all these...  Both their voices went down.  Oh, man.  She's like, does that feel good?  And I'm like...  She's like, yeah, that feels good.  I'm sitting there and I'm like...  Do I pull my dick out?  Is this what I think it is?  Is this all right?  Is this okay?  Yeah, yeah.  We turned on?  Like I'm like...  I'm looking at her like...  And anyway, she's going to wink and my wife's going to go... 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Happy birthday.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like...  Oh, fuck.  I thought you were a doula.  I was going to pull my mediocre shiny dick out.  Oh, I was fucking so turned on.  And then she had me get behind her.  And...  Oh.  Oh, I was just staring at the girl's face as I'm rubbing my wife's ass.  You were having kind of a threesome thing going on there.  Yeah, yeah.  It was so good.  I had flop sweat.  It was just this... 
[02:46:00]  Oh, man.  ...beautiful moment.  And, you know, those girls, the doulas are kind of hippie people.  Yeah.  So there's that possibility...  So they're down for whatever.  Well, you know, it might be some tantric shit.  No, this is good.  I'm going to show you with my clitoris.  If you can take out of my pocketbook, this is called a doula brush.  Ah, right.  And I'm going to show you how I want the cervix to look.  Come here, Bobby.  Just stick your fist...  Oh, my God.  Do you have a nice body?  She was smoking hot.  Smoking hot.  What does a doula do? 
[02:46:30]  We're talking about the doula.  Are they only for pregnant women, or are they for...  Is it like a yoga thing for everyone?  Jim's like, can I hire one?  Of course I can hire one.  Can I hire that one?  That's the reason why he's asking.  Jim's going to hire a doula.  Do they have to be pregnant?  Are they...  Do they no massage?  She walks in and goes, where's your wife?  Oh, oh.  She'll show up.  I'll be like, I have a log I'm trying to get out.  I'll ask you to massage my tummy.  A dou doula.  A dou doula.  Oh, my God.  Between us, we're in our 90s. 
[02:47:00]  And that made me laugh.  A dou doula.  But do they only for pregnancy, or are they your father?  What does exactly a medulla do?  I'm not a mud doula.  A medulla.  A medulla.  A medulla.  A medulla.  A medulla.  Whatever.  I'm going to douche you.  What do I know?  Oh, is it?  What is it?  What is it?  It's like, from this time until you bring the baby home.  Is it a warm boy?  Muduba.  I'm blagada.  She does.  Mama says.  Mama says.  Does she do anything after the baby's born?  Not really, right?  Well, yeah. 
[02:47:30]  No, she can come.  They try.  Look, all this stuff is a scam.  I didn't know how baby stuff is all fucking a scam.  Yeah?  It's big business.  I don't remember any of this shit.  I remember.  No, no, no.  My mother was telling me she had me.  I didn't know my mother was in some fucking Catholic home because my mother gave birth  to my sister and me very young, so they just throw you in this home for unwed mothers.  Good old days.  Yeah.  You're a burden.  An embarrassment.  And you didn't go in the hospital.  She went in the hospital by herself. 
[02:48:00]  Back in the day, nobody came with you.  No.  It was just wretched old nurses with hats.  Yeah.  And you gave birth, and then you were in the room, and then people could come after.  The husband stayed in the waiting room, pacing cigars.  There was no waiting room.  You went home.  You went to the bar.  Oh, you went home.  You went to the bar.  Or to the bar.  There was no waiting room.  Go and buy.  See you later.  We'll let you know if she lives.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  So what they do is they try to, at the end, I can teach you about breastfeeding, but 
[02:48:30]  I'd have to come back.  You really don't.  You can just tell me right now.  I'm not that stupid.  Right.  I'll remember.  Yeah.  And I can YouTube a fucking 12-year-old German girl.  Fuck.  What you want to do is get the breast.  Yeah.  But yeah, they teach you a little bit.  They want to come back because they'll be part of your life for the next year if you  let them.  You should.  Yeah.  They want to make sure the baby latches on good.  Latches.  That's right.  Gets a good latch going.  Yep.  And the kid cries not there.  Oh, no.  Where's the...  And they want the husband and the baby. 
[02:49:00]  That's what they want.  That's why she's hot.  I get a good latch on the clit.  I use my instincts from childhood, from infancy, to get that latch I used to get on a nipple  to eat for actual sustenance on the clit.  I latch.  You know what turns a girl on?  It brings out her mothering instincts.  If you suck her tits and you hold her tit with both hands, and you get her to cup your  hand.  And you knead it like a kitten.  Yeah.  You like start doing the... 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Like you're kneading dough with your hands.  And then I...  And you purr.  And I'm wearing a little short, and I kick my feet back and forth.  Oh, my God.  And they look at me.  You gotta look up at them, too.  Spray liquid shit on her leg.  Exactly.  On her thigh.  You gotta look her in the eye, too, when you're doing it.  Yeah.  Like, I'm feeding.  We should get Jimmy a pack and play.  I can't wait for you to have the now what moment.  That is when you bring the newborn home, and now you don't have the safety of the hospital,  where they know what to do, and they do everything for you. 
[02:50:00]  Scary.  You're gonna close that apartment door.  You're gonna have those balloons in your apartment, and you're gonna look at Dawn.  Congratulations.  You're gonna look at Dawn and go, holy shit, now what?  First of all, we're not gonna have any of that congratulation.  No?  No.  All our family is...  Oh, we'll send some.  In Boston.  Oh, we're gonna have to send them on.  You want some balloons?  No, I'm good.  I'm good with the balloons.  Some blue balloons?  Have your baby saved your house?  Have you...  No.  Oh, that's...  You got a sharp edge.  Yeah, it's a later, right?  No, you don't need that shit.  I have a nice sharp drop down my spiral staircase that I'm gonna have to fix. 
[02:50:30]  You literally have a hole in your floor.  I just spent...  Spiral staircase is a hole in the floor.  I just spent $2,000 on, like, redoing the whole area over there so it looks cool, and  I'm gonna have to fucking ruin that with some stupid baby game.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  What?  The whole looks cool shit goes out the window.  Oh, no.  My apartment used to look cool.  Oh, no.  Not so much right now.  Just baby toys everywhere?  Everywhere.  We look like we're hoarding baby fucking toys.  In the corner on the wall is just a drawing. 
[02:51:00]  Just some crayon.  Do you have any marks on your couches?  Oh, God.  God, everything's ruined.  Oh, God, it's ruined.  Everything's ruined.  Everything's ruined.  I spent...  I spent some good money to make my apartment look kick-ass.  Yeah.  Everything's ruined.  Fucking beautiful chairs are now not so beautiful.  Yeah.  My couch is, like, breast milk stains everywhere and baby formula stains.  I have a nice S in ballpoint pen on one of my movie theater chairs.  There you go.  You know them.  That's good.  And, yeah. 
[02:51:30]  If I had a kid...  Oh, forget it.  It was just from people...  Your brother's kid?  It was from a date.  She's trying to write help.  Helps.  All my...  Helps.  Helps.  All my accomplishments are now just tucked away in a...  Save me.  She did not write a help.  Yeah.  Help.  She's done a spell yet.  That's funny.  All my accomplishments are just in a closet, way up high.  That's it.  Yeah, but you also live in an apartment, though.  You're going to have...  Hopefully, you move into a house someday. 
[02:52:00]  I'm hoping.  And you get your office and you get your basement...  Get all that back.  ...where the kids can't go, right?  I have a beautiful desk.  It's just filled with toys and it's just piles of shit everywhere now.  Nobody mentions this shit to you when you say, I'm going to have a baby.  Dude, it's going to change your life.  You're going to be a better man.  Things are going to be better.  Nobody mentions all the other shit, the sleep, the house is ruined, all the shitty trips  to Disney World.  All your good stuff.  Like, you spent your life getting good stuff. 
[02:52:30]  And then your replacement, as they've been called...  Yes, they are.  Your replacement.  ...just screws up your stuff.  You're bringing your replacement into the world.  I don't mind that.  No, but I mean, as far as your apartment looking cool, maybe for the first month, maybe.  Yeah.  Well, my apartment's a lot smaller than yours, as we know.  Oh, that's got to be good.  You know, I have a duplex.  I mean, it's...  Every inch is going to be...  Oh, if you saw my room now, there's a crib.  And it's a fucking giant crib.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Like, this is a mini bed.  Yeah.  Like, there's no need.  I don't remember having my own fucking bed crib.  I was on the floor on a twin mattress with my mom and my sister in my uncle's room.  There was 13 of us in a house.  And you turned out all right.  Not...  Well, I mean, close.  We were right at the edge.  Yeah.  We've been at the edge a few times.  But I pull back at the last minute.  His family slept like fucking Charlie and Willy Wonka.  Yeah.  Absolutely. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  There's a fucking hole in the roof.  And then I guess your refrigerator has to turn into the Louvre for shitty artwork.  Yeah.  Is that what happens with kids?  Yeah.  It's like everybody's house that has kids, you go over, you go to open their fridge, and  magnets are falling off, and shitty little drawings are whispering their way to the ground.  That's the fucking best.  What the fuck?  That sounds like something of a comic.  That's like a joke.  I want to steal that.  That's like a joke.  Take it away, friend.  That's fucking brilliant.  And the kid doesn't care.  Shitty artwork.  The parents care about the art shit. 
[02:54:00]  The kids don't.  Well, they don't know.  And I get up way earlier than the rest of the house, so I fucking go around and I throw  shit away.  Oh, man.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, you'll learn that trick.  Oh, yeah.  Not your kid's drawings, right?  Oh, some of them.  Just the ones that say, too, mommy.  Some of them.  Too, my, mommy.  No, some of them.  And then you start by throwing broken toys away, but then you realize the clutter's so  out of hand, you just start throwing fucking...  You're starting to do triage on the fucking toys.  Really nice toys away, and the kid doesn't know.  Oh, you've got to thin the herd, man. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, or it gets out of control.  It'd be great if you're listening to this show.  When you came home, he's just fucking eyeballing you.  Look at my shit.  How dare you?  Yeah.  What do you think?  I don't have ears?  Well, he says, how dare you?  And he now says, you've got to be kidding me.  And then we didn't have the right cheese yesterday, so he said, look what you did.  Holy shit.  A little Richie Rich.  Look what you did, he said yesterday, because we had the wrong cheese.  Here's my goal, for that kid to start going, that don't make no sense. 
[02:55:00]  I'm not letting...  First of all, I told him, Uncle Paul doesn't get to come over the house anymore.  No, no.  No.  Jimmy's great around babies, I've got to tell you.  Yeah, but not Uncle Paul.  I don't want Chip.  Edgar can go fuck himself.  Look at the baby.  Jimmy, I like to touch the forehead.  Jimmy's very fascinated by babies, I've noticed, when he comes over.  They're very cute.  They're very fascinating.  He's very fascinated by the whole thing.  I'm very good with babies and animals.  And the baby proves six months, and then you've got to start worrying about that shit.  First six months, you don't really have to worry about that shit. 
[02:55:30]  Because the baby's just in the bed eating and shitting.  But do you have things?  Like, do you have a coffee table that is going to have to fucking go?  No.  Is it made out of glass with fucking armadillo spines on it?  Are you from Texas?  It's just very dangerous.  You remember?  Such a fucking gun guy coffee table.  Please.  My armadillo coffee table.  I had a beautiful glass table that cost a fucking fortune with fucking sharp edges.  And we had to get rid of it.  Now we've got a shitty pottery barn thing. 
[02:56:00]  You had the nice glass one that Little Richard used to lay under?  It was beautiful, though.  It was so nice.  Either way.  Why not?  It's a duty joke.  Yeah.  I just gave it away, too.  Because I couldn't charge someone to take my glass.  It was beautiful, too, man.  I'm so bummed.  I think we're going to have to move and get a house.  Like, really?  Move, move.  I don't think I'm going to do a house, though.  I mean, I think I want a townhouse.  Because I don't want to have to shovel, and I don't want to do the yard.  Raise a city kid? 
[02:56:30]  I don't mind a city kid.  I don't mind.  He's going to be born in Manhattan.  But, you know, I just don't know if I'm going to stay in the city.  I mean, you've got to go to private school.  What's that?  30 fucking grand a semester.  Or whatever the fuck it is.  Yeah, you can't send me to public school.  Forget about it.  No, not here.  Because I have the public schools around my house, and they're fucking crazy.  Yo, I'll tell you right now.  My kids start school next year.  They start at three now, for whatever reason.  Three and a half.  What the fuck is that?  And 21 Gs.  21 Gs.  A year?  To send the kid to school to, like, fucking do silly kid shit. 
[02:57:00]  At three, there's nothing they're going to teach.  That's a nice one-bedroom in New York.  Like, owning a one with 20-something grand.  Bobby, we got out cheap.  Kids in our neighborhood, it's 50, 60, 70 Gs a year for a three-and-a-half-year-old.  Yeah.  We got out cheap with 21 Gs.  You ever walk by one of the schools in New York, and it's just loud and obnoxious, and a ball flies over?  Yo, get that!  Yeah.  I don't want my kid there.  P.S., get his ass kicked.  Yeah.  That's the fucking...  You don't want to send him to...  I don't want my kid to be that fucking ass kicker, either. 
[02:57:30]  I don't want to be some fucking bully.  No.  Because he had to be.  Because his father is...  Yeah, you got to send him to some proper school.  Oh, that moved to...  You had no choice.  Move out of the city, go to a nice little neighborhood.  Well, they come out sounding like this.  Hello.  Yeah.  There's so many different...  Great day, Peter.  Teach that kid character.  Move to, like, Bedford-Stuyvesant.  Right.  All people are good.  Oh, God.  There are parents like that.  Oh, they move them into the crappiest area.  No, you go to that school.  You got to learn about other cultures. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Other cultures like Oz.  Yeah.  They're terrible.  Every day you learn what B.O. smells like.  Do the...  I went to...  They sent me to one of those schools when I was in punk back in Boston, when I was in my  juvie days.  Yeah.  And I remember I didn't know what, like, B.O. smells.  I just smelled the smell every day.  Well, there were probably men in their fucking 20s.  Yeah.  From fucking Venezuela?  I went to fucking Central Islip.  I went to school in Central Islip on Long Island. 
[02:58:30]  It was, like, fucking 85% black.  No way.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  And Hispanic.  Yeah.  And I would just get shaken down for money.  Yeah.  Give me 50 cent.  Give me 50 cent.  And I'd be thinking, like, it's cents.  You pluralized that.  I wouldn't tell them that.  Why would you?  You'd just hand it over.  Yeah.  It'd be hilarious if you gave it to them and then said, you're saying it wrong.  Yeah.  You're saying it wrong, dummy.  Took a nice beating for that.  Oh, boy.  It'd be annoying if you just did it all the time.  Then finally, I'd be like, all right, how do you say it?  Can you teach?  He'd come in here. 
[02:59:00]  It'd be like a little movie.  Can you teach me how to talk, Rags?  Yeah.  Yeah.  As I walk through the valley of the...  Yeah.  No, it wasn't every day, but it was, you know, it was every so often.  He would just come around and he'd fuck it.  And he looked like he was in his fucking late teens.  He was a big bruiser.  Well, I hung out with those kids.  It was either you got fucked with by those kids or you became one of those guys.  And I was never the tough guy.  I just hung out with tough guys.  And I had that little Spanish mustache. 
[02:59:30]  So they thought I was...  I thought you were Hispanic.  I was in wood class one day and they were all making fun of these white guys.  They were like, white people this way.  And I turned instinctually because I'm Italian-Irish from Boston.  You're not Irish.  I am.  Robert Patrick Kelly.  And they were like, yo, you Spanish, you Puerto Rican.  I'm like, nah, I'm fucking Italian-Irish, dude.  They're like, get the fuck out of here.  They thought I passed because I look Spanish.  Right.  And I hung out with those guys.  And then...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, boy.  Whoa.  Oh, shit.  Come on in.  How you doing?  Take a seat right there.  Nice to meet you.  Anthony.  It's Bobby.  It's Bobby.  Hey.  Opie.  We're on the air, too.  Wow.  Yeah.  We're on the air.  We just do that.  Rhonda Rousey has to enter the studio.  My God.  That's fine.  Welcome to the show.  Yes.  Wait, which mic is that?  Why can't you use that one?  Because George is coming in, too, so we wanted to have...  Which one is that?  Six.  Six.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  George right there. 
[03:00:30]  There's a whole lot of testosterone in this room.  Yeah.  I'm not really.  Just half the room.  It's an illusion.  Yeah, it's definitely an illusion.  It's a total illusion.  We're putting a bunch of pussies in this fucking room.  So have you been doing a lot of press today?  Yeah.  Most of this week.  So I'm a guest fighter.  So for 159.  Wait, wait, wait.  Rhonda.  He put his chair up extra high for you.  No, I'm trying to bring it down because it's uncomfortable.  I think he's trying to impress you a little bit.  He lost 30 pounds and he's feeling good about himself.  Thanks, Rhonda. 
[03:01:00]  And now you have to look up at him.  Yeah.  A couple athletes just connecting.  That's okay.  I don't like being seen from a low angle.  It gives you extra chins.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Looking good out there, buddy.  Thank you.  The farther away I am, the better I look.  You've got a great smile.  Thank you.  My God.  Not you.  Not me.  What the fuck?  Can't you feel good about me for a minute?  Stupid thing.  Do you get like, because you're so used to being around like just all male environments.  Does that ever get like kind of just shitty and irritating?  No, I'm actually much more comfortable in a setting like this. 
[03:01:30]  If I walked into a room full of chicks, I probably would have felt like, oh, my God.  Really?  Yeah.  You guys are easy.  It's like a man psyche.  It seems less complicated than women to me.  That's true.  We're a bunch of adults.  We're easier to dominate, too, I'm sure, like mentally than women are because with the  stuff that men do to men and women, you know what I mean?  It's just a different dynamic.  Maybe.  I mean, like with women, I dominate women for a living, you know?  So it's just kind of like, if you mess with a girl, like they're going to take it personally 
[03:02:00]  forever.  But if I'm like busting your balls, you'll laugh about it and be over it.  Right, right, right.  I'm a compulsive ball buster.  So girls really don't like me too much.  Yeah, I would gather.  How did you get into it?  Did you, were you growing up?  Did you have to, you know, fend for yourself in the woods?  Were you raised by wolves?  What happened?  No, no.  My mom was the first American to ever win the world championships in judo.  And so I started when I was 10 and by six years later, I was on my first Olympic team. 
[03:02:30]  I just had a knack for it.  Wow.  I saw your countdown.  It was probably one of the best countdowns they've ever done on UFC because it was the  most real when you talked about your dad and you actually said, you're like, I'm sick  of doing this.  I feel like I'm fucking, you guys get me to talk about my dad to get me to cry.  I feel like I'm disrespecting him.  It was like the most honest thing anybody's ever said, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  I feel like they were, they just do it on purpose to the point of like, Hey, you want to see  Rhonda cry?  Oh boy.  I want you to go ask her a bunch of questions about her dad. 
[03:03:00]  Why don't you just ask her to recite the whole thing over again?  I'm just like, look, I, it's funny.  The primetime was the first one that aired was the last interview that I did about it.  So I had HBO Real Sports, then the countdown and then primetime.  And primetime was the last one they asked me that question.  And I was just like, you know what?  This is the last time I'm going to say it.  I'm going to say it right.  And no one's asking me this again.  I'm not answering it again.  Should have kicked their fucking ass.  I literally have no idea what you're talking about.  Like with that, I guess it was obviously a tragedy in the family or you're just.  Read it.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm not talking about it again.  Google it.  I'm not doing it again. 
[03:03:30]  No, but I mean, is it, is it something recent or something longstanding that people know?  It's something longstanding that people know.  And it's just like, Oh, it's such a good story.  Why don't you tell it again?  And I'm like, no.  Have you and your mom ever, you guys fight because you practice together.  She taught you what she knows.  But do you guys ever, when you ever fought, do you ever get pissed off?  Like, do you ever try to really put an ass whooping on your mom?  No, but she did stop like sparring with me at a certain point.  And I never really realized why. 
[03:04:00]  And then years later, she told me that like I threw her and broke her hand.  Holy shit.  It's funny.  I had the same argument with my mother.  She was such a tough lady.  She never even said anything.  I didn't even realize it.  She was like, whatever.  You know, like my mom was like 5'2 and like, you know, 120 pounds soaking wet.  Maybe.  Maybe 115.  You know, and then she's just like, yeah, whatever.  You know, you broke my hand once.  It was just like, man, it was time to stop.  You're getting big.  I'm like, oh, really?  I never knew.  It sucked.  The days of parent where you're like, I'm going to. 
[03:04:30]  I remember my little brother last year.  We were messing around and he grabbed me from behind and he broke one of my ribs.  He just cracked a rib and I had to go.  And he's like, what's wrong?  He's got that deep, what's wrong in that Boston?  What's wrong, kid?  What'd you pop a rib, pussy?  I was like, no, I'm good, you cocksucker.  It's like a shit day in life.  You're a little brother.  Yeah.  The obviously we've seen women fighters over the years and usually not, not the most attractive 
[03:05:00]  bunch of ladies.  I'll just say it, you know, based on what people find attractive.  You, on the other hand, ah, different story.  You ever afraid of taking like quite a shot to the face and ruining those good looks?  There is some equity in being an attractive fighter.  Oh, thank you.  I always say you have to watch out for the pretty ones because they get hit the least.  But with my nose, it's been broken so many times.  I broke it from Cheeto so many times.  Really?  It just squishes down.  I got like a durable little nose. 
[03:05:30]  Wow.  You can punch as much as you want.  And my ears are already shot.  I've had cauliflower ears since I was 16.  Can I see yours?  Because I didn't notice that.  I didn't notice that either.  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  But that doesn't look nearly as bad as like...  It's like the girl version of cauliflower ears.  That's great.  That does not look like anything...  It doesn't look bad at all.  The Weight Watchers TV dinner.  Yeah, it's like a cauliflower for ladies.  You don't have BJ Penn ears.  They were, dude.  When I first got them...  You can't wear headphones?  I can't wear like the little ones you stick in your ear.  I can't.  But yeah, when I first did, it turned like totally inside out and was black and blue. 
[03:06:00]  Holy shit.  I went to high school, you know?  And so everyone was like, she has the plague!  Like no one knew what judo was.  It wasn't cool back then.  I did it before.  It was cool.  Did you ever use your abilities in a fight?  In a real street fight type problem?  Yeah, I've had to defend myself in Daniel-san-esque situations.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was like, I do not want to do this.  Yeah, don't make me.  But you can force the situation upon me.  I disclaimer it beforehand.  I was like, I will have to do something. 
[03:06:30]  And then, you know.  You just romp.  Yeah.  What's worse than being in a bar and you see a girl and you grab her ass and as she turns,  you see the cauliflower ear.  Oh, no.  Like, fucked up.  That was no good.  That would be a bad sign right there.  Do men react to you differently, like when they're hitting on you or whatever?  Because is there like a weird psychology because you're a fighter and there really is that.  There's always a weird thing where men know that physically we're dominant over women.  But with you, that's just not the case unless it's another fighter.  I'm kind of like caught in this weird space where it's like either guys won't hit on me at all or like the second I meet them, they're like, marry me. 
[03:07:00]  One or the other.  I was like, I don't want somewhere in the middle, like, just ask me for coffee.  Coffee.  I like coffee.  I love coffee.  You guys shut up.  If anyone ever wants to know how to ask me out, go offer me a latte.  That's it.  Wow.  There you go.  That's a lot easier.  And you kind of accept it, too, so I guess we're having coffee.  Sank her for me, though.  Oh, I just blew it.  What a great couple they would be. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, me carrying her bags behind her.  All right, which way, honey?  Oh, fuck that.  A lot of questions, guys.  I'm probably carrying your bags, let's be honest.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Yeah, really?  My arm hurts.  That's embarrassing.  I got you.  Don't worry.  A lot of questions I think guys have about girls that fight.  Your breasts.  What do you...  Yeah, it almost happened last fight.  Your last fight.  What happened, Bobby?  It was not my fault.  It was happening over and over.  When she had you in that choke... 
[03:08:00]  I don't mean I'm falling out.  It was seconds away.  I know.  I was thinking about it.  We're watching TV.  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's almost there.  It's there.  Oh, my God.  No.  I was like...  Me and my wife were like, what?  Her boob is going to pop out right now.  Well, I told them to give me the exact same outfit as the fight before, but unfortunately,  they gave me the same sports bra for the weigh-ins and the fight.  And so I thought, hey, I'll double up.  I'll wear another bra under it.  It'll totally work.  And well, I'm happy I added to the suspense of the fight.  Yeah.  It's really distracting. 
[03:08:30]  I don't doubt it.  I was thinking, titties, no!  Yeah, you've got to think alike.  It's going to be all over the internet or something.  You should get an extra point if you pull a boob out.  I don't know what they would do.  What about getting hit there?  Is it more painful, I would wonder, than hitting a peck?  I mean, I haven't really gotten straight, blocked, right in the boob, but I mean, I'm  sure getting hit in the balls is a lot worse.  Well, yeah, I would assume, too.  How often do you see a guy go to that one and go, uh, like right in the chest? 
[03:09:00]  It doesn't really happen.  It doesn't really happen.  It's really humiliating that she picked me for the best example.  I told her one of them, she said, right?  She looked at me and then reached for you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I should have Jon Jones reach.  I got my Space Jam, I'd get him over there.  Yeah, that almost happened.  It's really weird when you watch.  Like, at first, you hear, like, oh, there's women fighting in the UFC and then from Strike 
[03:09:30]  Force.  And then all of a sudden, it just became this thing where it's like, oh, it's like any  other fight.  Like, I found myself getting really invested in it and wanting to see you win.  And, you know, that happened really fast.  Like, women in the NBA, typically, no one cares about that sport as much.  Yeah.  And now it's just, you're just seen as a fighter as opposed to.  You were at Strike Force.  You were the champion over there.  And you just dominated everybody.  And you and Misha was, because she's, you know, she's great, too.  And she's very pretty.  And when you guys fought, that was just so big.  And that's when Dana White actually took notice. 
[03:10:00]  Because he said he'd never have female fighters ever.  Right.  Like, never.  He once said that.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, never.  He goes, it's not going to happen.  And then a year later, after she was in Strike Force, her and Misha had this fight.  And it was a great fight.  Great buildup to a fight, too.  Which matters.  You know, before the fight, I think, is more important than the fight.  When the fight happens, of course, that's the more important part.  But the buildup is, like, are you interested in these two people fighting?  Yeah, you've got to sell it.  Right.  And you guys.  Especially with girls, too.  I mean, everyone, these housewives shows, these multi-million dollar businesses. 
[03:10:30]  I mean, what if after all these arguments and stuff, people are so into chicks' arguments,  what if they got to, like, throw down at the very end?  Watch them write fight.  Exactly.  If you see two guys fighting, you don't know who they are, or, you know, or whatever.  And you watch, and one guy hits the other guy, like, oh, you know, that was that.  He should have maybe ducked from that.  But if one girl hits another girl, and there's an argument involved, I don't care if she just  tapped her on the face.  You're going to be like, oh!  She flicked her in the nose.  Like, oh, she flicked her in the nose.  She doesn't like her.  Like, it's just emotionally invested in girl fights. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's true.  It's true when they're hot, too.  I mean, Rhonda and Misha are two of the hottest girls in the sport.  Do you get any shit talk from some of the girls that aren't quite as attractive?  Do you get, yeah, pretty girl, I'm going to fucking bust you up, bust your face up?  Uh, yeah.  I think, uh, it was, like, two fights ago, I was fighting this girl, Kaufman, and she's  like, I'm going to hit her in her pretty face and make her not so pretty anymore.  Jesus.  And then I walked out, I was like, she's not going to hit me once.  Like, just for some reason, because she said that, she's like, she's not going  to touch me once, and so, uh, that was fun. 
[03:11:30]  How'd that work out?  She didn't touch me once.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you, 7-0, right?  Uh, yeah.  Jesus.  And, uh, all arm bars in the first, uh, round.  It's, it's, it's amazing.  It's unstoppable.  That's the worst part, is that everybody knows what she's going to do, and they still can't  stop it.  That just sucks.  Damn.  For her, like, she's not going to do it.  Ah, you're, imagine just be, ah, shit, just tapping out.  Are there any guys that you would think you'd have a good shot against?  Yeah, she's, there are five of them in this room.  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I think anybody I feel like 
[03:12:00]  I have a chance with.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Any of the guys, you'd, you'd take that chance, maybe?  Well, would I?  I'm not saying, you know, believe me.  I think for the sport, it probably wouldn't be a good thing.  No.  Because even though I have, you know, a very healthy amount of self-confidence, any match  would go anyway with any person.  Sure, yeah.  And so, if someone turns on their TV and sees a guy beating a girl up, I'm like, good  luck making that the most popular sport in the world.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, but you'd watch for a couple minutes.  Of course. 
[03:12:30]  Especially if she has an apron on.  Jesus.  Right.  Little fucking domestic violence joke.  Just a joke.  Why the armbar?  I mean, not that you choose that, but why does that become your main weapon?  Um, well, mostly in, in judo, the refereeing is terrible and, um, Americans are not very  popular.  And so, when my mom was fighting back in the day, um, she is like, you know, a tiny little  Latina woman who's walking into a male Japanese sport. 
[03:13:00]  No one wanted her to win.  So, um, the most definite way to win was an armbar.  Because if you throw somebody, they might not count it.  If you pin somebody, they might not count it.  If you're choking somebody, they might stand you out.  The person would be fine.  But she would always say, if you get the person an armbar and you finish it, yeah, they can  stand the person back up and they only got one arm.  And they're much more easier to beat after that.  And she's just always said it's the most definite way to win.  And so, um, I always felt like I was fighting against the referees.  Like, I had to try and win so fast and so efficiently that they couldn't stop me.  And so, that's why we kind of gravitated more towards the armbar. 
[03:13:30]  It was less.  You can't argue with it.  Right.  Really, I've had them, like I said, I have fighters do moves on me, but really like low  fucking level.  So, just to feel it.  And an armbar, the first one it did, it was BJ Penn.  I couldn't believe how much it hurt.  Like, I knew it hurt from watching it, but you don't realize that you're being stretched like  two ways.  Like, you're being pulled out that way and your chest is being pulled.  Where does it hurt the most?  I don't, I would say in the, uh, I don't know.  It was like this, it's hard to, when you get kicked in the balls, there's a left or right 
[03:14:00]  one more unpleasant.  It's just, it's this dull throb through your whole.  Like your chest is ripping open on one side.  Yeah, and you just know that, that you feel helpless when it's happening.  It's fucking, and when.  What would be the injury if it keeps going?  Wait, we can swear in here?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah, let's do this, Rhonda.  I was waiting to fucking swear the whole time, I was like, no, it's AM shows, I'm like,  don't say titties, I was like, I got yelled at for saying titties, I was like, I got yelled  at for saying titties.  No, man, let it fly.  Oh man, I didn't even know.  Oh good, you got a good potty mouth, do you? 
[03:14:30]  Thanks for the late heads up, well yeah, but it's not doing me any good, I'm almost fucking  done.  What would the injury be if the arm bar keeps going?  It's a hyperextension of the elbow joint.  Oh, that doesn't sound good at all.  Didn't Jones in his fight with Vitor Belfort, it looked like, he was, Vitor was hanging, and  Jones' arm bent almost like a knee in, and I was like, he's a tough fuck.  Yeah, you can also pop, you can also break the bone right here, that happened with that.  Yeah, or like shoulder.  Frank Mir did that too, a guy. 
[03:15:00]  No, he did it like in the middle of the bicep, I don't think it was down here.  What was his name, Tim?  Then he, remember he popped the bone out when he popped the to win the championship.  Magara.  The second time.  No, that was, I'm talking way, way back.  Tim Sylvia, he actually, he had the arm bar and he wouldn't tap, and the bone, you saw  the bone just pop up.  How the fuck do you not tap at that point?  Well, see, that really shows a lot about both people, though, you know, it's like, John  Jones, I had a lot more respect for him after that fight, because you could just tell he 
[03:15:30]  was like, no, like, it's not today, no, like, I'm willing to give up my arm, no, I'm willing  to give up at least 20 inches of that reach, no, and when you see, like, just that refusal  in somebody, you know, I'm just so impressed with that, I love him, he's awesome.  That's wild, man.  Yeah, he really is, so you're promoting, by the way, they're telling us in our earphones,  we only have a couple of minutes with Rhonda, because she's doing a tremendous amount of  press, is, you're promoting UFC 159 this weekend, right?  And it is, you know, we had Chael in yesterday, so it's, you know, Jones, yeah, he was great. 
[03:16:00]  Chael's a man.  But it was weird, I saw Jones briefly after, he came in later, and he looked very calm and  very relaxed and really fucking ready to fight.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, that's just not a ring I'd want to step into, or anyone for that matter.  I'm saying that like I cut the fucking line of John Jones, and I really should shut my  fucking fat face.  Chael, okay.  Yeah, Chael, I'd go with him.  I was the breast example three minutes ago.  It's at the Prudential Center tomorrow, I'm sorry, Saturday in New Jersey, tomorrow's the 
[03:16:30]  weigh-ins, 7 o'clock West Coast, 10 o'clock here on the East Coast.  Tickets are available at Ticketmaster, or do what I do whenever I'm on the road, because  I'll be in Austin, just fucking order it online if you're not here.  Because the streaming for UFC is amazing.  Even on Fairly Shit Connections, you can still watch the fight and really, really...  And of course, yeah, pay-per-view.  Yeah, pay-per-view or whatever, yeah.  I'm thinking computer, what a fucking dope I am.  Yeah, if you're in a fucking rest area.  Oh, very cool.  Oh, man, you're fucking great.  She's hosting the new season.  You're hosting the new season of... 
[03:17:00]  Oh, I find her half guys, half girls, same house.  Yeah?  Yeah, that should be interesting.  It's going down.  Yeah, a lot of fucking.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  I think that's...  I don't mind to you.  They're going to be little angels on Team Ronda.  Okay.  Now, we always have the fighters do something to me.  And I've been advised...  She just knocked him out.  I've been advised not to let you do it.  People have said, don't let Ronda do it, because she'll fuck you up.  Oh.  But you seem really nice, and I trust you. 
[03:17:30]  Honestly, because I've had them all do it.  It's not some test of, like, I'm a guy, girl, do it.  Believe me, it's not that.  I've had...  Oh, he can't tap out quickly enough.  I really can't tap out fast enough.  And Fado put him in a choke.  It was one of the best...  Just...  Oh, he made a sound.  Did you have to be choked by Fado?  I certainly did, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds amazing.  Yeah, and he enjoyed it, too, because I was really in pain, and he just kept smiling and  redoing it.  He's a fucking...  He enjoyed it.  There's no...  He's my favorite.  All-time favorite.  Yeah.  I loved him, too.  And Jones...  Jon Jones almost made me vomit by putting his shin in my upper thigh. 
[03:18:00]  Like, I had never taken that kind of weird shock to the body.  And that fucked me up badly, so I won't do any more leg stuff.  Which...  What would you want to do to me?  Like, and I will tap fast.  What do I want to do to you?  Yeah, that's probably...  Avoid you is probably the answer.  Could you put him in on some kind of...  I would love to feel an arm bar if you would do it really, like, lightly.  Okay.  Um...  No, the left arm, because the right one's already in bad shape.  Oh, okay.  Oh, the whole idea is you just want the, um...  Because it's a straight joint like that.  It's not like a ball joint. 
[03:18:30]  Like, your shoulder can go all the way.  Yeah.  Your elbow only goes one way, right?  And so, when you get to this point, as long as you keep some sort of support behind the  joint, and then you press the hand the other way, you see how it starts to, like, hurt?  Right, right.  Now, if we were tied up, if we were, like, in what position would I be in where you had  that?  So, I'd have one leg across your neck.  And I'd have another leg across your stomach.  And I would pull your arm up in between my legs.  Oh, jeez.  And I'd have to arch my back until your elbows stopped.  Wow.  Why did Dana not want this? 
[03:19:00]  No, Dana didn't advise me.  I'm talking about women in the UFC.  Doesn't that sound awesome?  Yeah, it sounds fantastic.  The way you describe it sounds so cool.  I know.  I wouldn't you want to watch that.  I'd be like, okay.  I'd like, that would be the fucking, the worst time to ever tap when she's laying with her  legs across your feet.  Like, I really don't want to.  But I do.  Your arm is just ripped out of its side.  You're like, I just love being here.  Yeah.  Good luck trying to lick your elbow the rest of the day.  Fuck.  I kind of want her, I kind of want her, not a full one, but something. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  Like, I kind of want to, I want to choke him.  You should choke him.  Would you choke him?  Yeah.  Not, not, it's weird.  If this was a guy fighter, it'd be fine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But she's smoking hot.  It's like, weird.  It's like, not on me.  But for me, it's the same thing.  Yeah, it's just weird.  I don't find anything erotic about it.  Believe me, I've been choked.  You've got to do the arm bar.  The full arm bar.  Well, whatever Rhonda wants to do.  Yeah, Rhonda, would you like to do that?  Well, you'd have to lay him on the floor.  All right.  There he goes. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, God.  All right.  I will tap quickly.  Hold on a second.  I got, like, a full, like, coat on.  Yeah, yeah.  Jeez.  Um.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  On the ground, or do you want me to put you there?  No, I'll lay.  I don't know.  Which way do I go?  On my back or my...  They're trying to open the door.  Oh, my goodness.  There we go.  No one else comes in.  Okay, there we go.  I got heels on, so, you know, close your eyes.  I don't want to, like, throw a leg over. 
[03:20:30]  Okay.  Okay, now, can you feel me tapping here?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Now, I'm laying there.  She's got her legs around me.  So, you have to hold on to your arms.  You have to show how you take it off.  I'm holding my arm.  I'm holding my one arm, and she's...  So, you have to squeeze her.  She's tightening up.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  And I'm going to go up to the wrist.  Okay.  So, that's where you hold on tightest.  Yeah.  And she's got my neck, too.  Up towards the head.  That was pretty effortless.  Yeah, I just lean.  And then, you lean back.  And...  That's as far as your elbow goes, right?  And then, I was like...  Oh, yeah.  Wow. 
[03:21:00]  I heard something crack.  I was trying to be really gentle.  I wasn't.  It was...  It was...  She was very gentle, but as soon as you leaned back, I could feel that my arm would fucking  would pop.  That was really...  It was fun and unpleasant at the same time.  Thank you for being gentle.  It was fun and pleasant.  Yeah.  That's exactly how she felt.  Fun but unpleasant.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was impressive.  So, we have...  I guess we have...  Should we take a break or should we keep going?  Because we have... 
[03:21:30]  Do just a real quick break.  We can do a two-minute break.  Yeah.  Two-minute?  Yeah.  Two-minute break.  We'll be right back.  Just a...  Yeah.  All right.  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  We'll be at the show.  We are...  Hey.  We're back?  Yes, we're back.  That was a quick break.  We just took a quick...  Yeah.  Just to get our pictures.  Yeah.  Rhonda.  Get our photos.  And now we have George St. Pierre in studio.  You're promoting a book.  You're not promoting UFC this weekend. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  My book, but UFC as well.  You want to talk UFC, we talk UFC.  Do you guys like going to fights and watching other fighters?  Because I wouldn't want to watch someone else doing the same thing if I wasn't doing it at the moment.  It depends on who, you know.  But I do like...  There's a lot of guys that I like to watch.  And I learn from them.  Who do you like to watch?  Jon Jones is very good.  This weekend, actually, the two guys are fighting in the final.  They're very good.  I really enjoy watching them.  Yeah.  I think Jones is...  And I like both of those guys.  I kind of want to see Chael win. 
[03:22:30]  But I think Jones is...  It's just a little too big for Chael.  Yeah, Jones is a big guy.  Yeah.  But then on the other hand, we never see Jon Jones fighting off his back.  And Chael, you can put him on his back.  So, you know, his style makes fight.  It's going to be a very good fight, regardless of what's going to happen.  I think it's going to be very entertaining.  Yeah.  I was reading through your book.  I didn't finish the book.  I didn't have time to.  But I was amazed to read...  It's called, by the way, The Way of the Fight.  And George is doing signings here.  Eight o'clock at Bookends tonight, which is in Ridgewood, New Jersey. 
[03:23:00]  And I think the 26th is tomorrow at the Book Review in Huntington, Long Island.  So you can meet George at one of those two places.  And were you bullied when you were a kid?  I was amazed to read that.  Yes, I was.  I grew up in school.  I had problems.  And I got picked on a lot while growing up.  Really?  Yes.  For what?  Well, I was not a popular kid.  I was not popular with the girls.  I was very shy. 
[03:23:30]  I didn't have any friends.  And I'm from the countryside.  And I went to school.  So, yeah, I had a problem growing up, you know.  Were you small at the time?  Small, yeah.  I had my, what do you call it, gross sperm later.  You know, I had it late.  So the guy, they had it before me.  So, yeah.  But it was mostly by a delicate teenager.  They were in my school.  They call it TGA.  It's a delicate teenager problem.  They were older.  And they were delicate people, you know.  Do you ever go back and try to find those guys on Facebook? 
[03:24:00]  No, no, no.  The bald, fat guy with nine kids.  Yeah.  You know, I met one one time.  I remember I met one in a store, you know, in a mall.  And I knew he recognized me.  And I recognized him.  So I shake, just wave my hand.  You know, I don't have any anger towards him.  It's past when we're young.  We do stupid things.  He went back to Chick-fil-A instead of shaking.  Thank you.  How far into your fighting career when you saw this guy? 
[03:24:30]  I was champion, you know.  Oh, so it was champion.  I signed them all.  And I walked.  And he looked down.  He pretended he did not recognize me.  But I knew he did recognize me.  He knew who I was.  But, you know, I don't care.  You know, I'm not going to do anything.  It would be crazy, though, to pick on a kid as a young kid.  And then he's the champion of fucking the world in UFC and fighting.  Yeah, but this guy can say, oh, I beat this guy when I was young. 
[03:25:00]  I beat the champion.  So I'm the uncroned champion of the UFC.  I took his fucking loonies.  What is it up there?  That's funny.  It's also, you know, I forgot what I was going to say because you asked that question.  Oh, you were, how afraid of you were you weren't going to fight again when you had knee surgery?  I was scared.  But I'm going to tell you the truth.  When I went back to my fight against Carlos Condit, I knew my knee was 100%.  I was not concerned with that because I went to hell in training and put myself to much worse in training than in the fight. 
[03:25:30]  And you heard it how?  You heard it in training.  I heard it in training.  In the beginning, I didn't have the symptom of an ACL.  I didn't have any swelling.  So I thought it was my hamstring.  And a month after, after hard training, I still felt my knee was unstable.  And the doctor said, we'll take a picture.  Take a picture.  And then I had to find out the best doctor, best rehab.  I made my research.  Flew to LA, stayed there for six months.  And a good experience. 
[03:26:00]  You know, made some friends.  And I started writing the book.  That's how everything started.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I couldn't walk.  You know, I was in bed.  Couldn't train.  I was only doing like handstand.  Like crazy stuff with my upper body.  Upper body, huh?  Yeah.  And rehab every day.  So I was writing.  I was in bed most of the time.  So I was writing stuff, you know.  It went through my head.  Do you really have to watch what you're eating when you can't work?  Because I can imagine you could probably put on weight really easily.  No, not me.  Really?  Yeah, I'm like, yeah, I don't have diet. 
[03:26:30]  My sister, my family is like that.  My sister, they never even done a push-up in their life and they fit.  Really?  Just genetics.  No.  Bobby's like that.  When you hurt your ACL, did you scream anything like I broke my knee, dude?  Anything?  Did you scream at all?  Yeah, I broke my ACL, but I didn't feel it was an ACL.  Like it was weird.  It was in hyperextension.  Like it was, the way it was, the doctor explained to me, it happened very rarely. 
[03:27:00]  I broke it, but it happened very rarely the way I did.  So was it worse the way you had it or better than most, that injury could have been?  No, no, it could have, it could have get worse.  I was lucky in my bad luck because then I went to see a doctor after and they make the  physical test manually in Canada.  Oh, wow.  And in the US it's different.  The health system is different.  I think they, for athletes in the US, they're more professional than in Canada because in  Canada you don't pay, but everybody has the same treatment.  So doctor, they go fast, you know? 
[03:27:30]  Oh, man.  They go, they check, they check physically.  Oh, no, you know, I don't think it's your ACL, your knee is fine.  But they physically, when you do that, the test, the physical test or an athlete, the  muscle can hold the knee in place.  That's what they told me in the US.  So they say they should have took the picture.  So they didn't.  They'll just jiggle your leg and go, bah, you're fine, walk it off.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  No, no, but I mean, it's not like that everywhere, but I didn't know any better at the time.  Right, right.  I didn't have the symptom of an ACL.  I didn't have any swelling.  I said, man, my knee feel weird.  I didn't know if it was my knee or the bottom of my armstring. 
[03:28:00]  So they do the physical test and they say, oh, it's probably your armstring.  So I went to train.  But what could happen, because I didn't have ACL, I could have, when I was training, I didn't  have any ACL.  I was sparring.  I flew in, sparring with Victor Belfer and all those big guys.  I was sparring hard.  I could have hurt myself.  Because I didn't have ACL, I could have tore my MCL and PCL and all meniscus.  This would have been bad for me.  So I've been lucky in my bad luck.  And your training is, I mean, you train all over the place. 
[03:28:30]  You don't just stay in one spot.  You train in New York.  You train up in Montreal.  Yeah.  You go out to Craig Jackson.  Everywhere I go, I have to go a lot of places that I go for business.  You know, so I was in LA for business stuff, like earlier it is for two weeks.  And I have a place to train in Los Angeles.  I have Freddie Roach.  In New York, I go to Hanzo Gracie, Phil Nurse.  Because everywhere I go in France, I have a place.  You know, in Brazil, I have a place.  So depending on where I am, I have a place. 
[03:29:00]  But normally, I'm in Montreal, Canada.  You said something, too, in the book, which I thought was interesting.  And I'm reading because I kind of wrote it down as a quote.  You said, there's no such thing as a normal relationship in my life.  And there's no such thing as a normal friendship in my life.  Why is that?  Because I'm 100% dedicated on what I do.  When I mean normal relationship,  let's say you talk about a woman.  Because in my life right now,  I don't put my relationship first. 
[03:29:30]  You know, like a normal guy has a normal job.  He will put his relationship first,  and family first, and the work, too.  Right.  I can't do that.  My job doesn't allow me to do that.  Some guys do it.  But I believe for me right now,  I want to be the best at this.  I need to focus 100%.  So my job will come first.  So for a woman, it's very hard to come first again.  You know, a lot of girls, they don't accept that.  So I say it's not normal.  It's not a normal relationship,  because I always ask to travel, do my thing,  put this what I have.  That's very honest. 
[03:30:00]  I'm going to call it honest.  No, it is honest.  And it's also, though,  I could imagine girls would probably be like,  no, it's okay.  I'd be fine with taking second for that,  because I understand you're very dedicated.  And then as time goes on,  so, oh, where do you got to go this weekend?  Yeah, but hey.  I'm going to call my pregnant wife right now  and tell her to beat it.  It's hard to understand.  I know a lot of people put in the same situation,  but, you know, it's hard to understand.  Yeah, yeah.  But girls, again, girls think they can handle it, 
[03:30:30]  and they start getting frustrated.  Do you want to bring a woman with you  when you're on the road?  Do you want her to be there with you?  There's a story about Chuck Liddell,  like a girlfriend fighting with him  right before he had to go down and fight.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, like she threw an ashtray at him or something.  It was like fight night.  Now, I'm going to ask you a question, guys,  and it's the same analogy.  Back in the day when, like, the gladiator,  the Spartan, used to go on the battlefield,  did they bring their wife with them?  I don't think so.  Absolutely not.  That's me when I'm going for the week of the fight.  They brought our head. 
[03:31:00]  When I go the week of the fight,  the week of the fight, you know,  even if I would be married with kids,  I would go only with my army,  my coaches,  because I'm in the mindset  that I'm not there to have,  you know, to be tender,  to be, you know,  I'm going to have a job to do.  Then after the fight,  I'll, you know,  I can go back to this,  but like,  the week of the fight,  it's important for me,  focus on what I need to do.  My life,  my well-being is on the line.  You can always tell a guy  who's going to lose  when you see the pre-fight 
[03:31:30]  and he's training  and his kids are running around the gym  and he's picking them  and the other guy's just,  you know,  picking up tires.  But what the woman,  what the girl,  what the wife need to understand  if you're married with kids,  like you say,  it's your well-being is on the line  and the well-being of the family  because if you win,  that's my paycheck,  that's, you know,  so I need that to provide,  you know,  so, you know what I mean,  that's hard to find.  That's common sense though.  Yeah, it would be hard  to find a girl,  you know,  and it's hard to find a girl 
[03:32:00]  that would understand that  and, you know what I mean.  What is the myth too  about fighters  and sex before fights?  We've heard different fighters  say different things.  Some say not at all  for a week or a month before  because it kills your energy  or is that bullshit?  That is bullshit,  I believe.  It is.  They have made study,  they say actually,  I think I believe  is that having more sex  is good for testosterone.  Oh, okay.  Ronda Rousey actually said that.  I believe it's true.  Yeah, I believe she's right.  I believe, like, I mean,  you know,  I wouldn't do it  the day of the fight  because, you know,  you feel like, 
[03:32:30]  you know.  It does, it doesn't,  I was going to give you a,  it takes away  your killer instinct too,  like, you know,  I never want to do.  That's a great point.  I just want to do nothing  after I have sex  or after, you know,  you know.  Exactly, you feel lazy as hell  and then I understand.  You pay the person,  they leave.  But I believe  if you have a lot of sex,  your body needs a lot,  so you have more testosterone.  You know,  I believe it could help 
[03:33:00]  in a way, you know,  but not right before the fight.  Not right before.  Hell no.  Hell no.  And your mother used to play records  for you with subliminal messages.  I was also interested  to read that.  Yeah, when I was young,  yeah,  like the ocean  because I have big problems  sleeping since I'm young  and even now,  like, sometimes I do it  in some years  because I think a lot  in my head,  you know,  I'm a big thinker  and something,  I get too deep  into my thoughts  and I have a hard time  focusing on sleeping.  Yes.  So the waves  and the birds,  you know,  because I had a problem  going up at school 
[03:33:30]  and it was good  for the confidence,  you know.  I think you're relating  your alcoholism  to his brain.  I'm like,  stop drinking  and go to bed, Anthony.  No, wait a minute,  my bed's spinning.  Wait a minute.  But I don't sleep either.  I'm a terrible sleeper,  so I have the same thing.  I can't fall asleep  or I have sleep apnea.  It sucks.  So I always wonder  what do fighters do  because I have to get up  and do this,  but to have to get up  and train physically  or do anything physical  is a fucking...  Or sleep before the day  of the fight.  It's got to be nerve-wracking.  Well, he takes a nap  after he trains.  You actually learn  how to do it. 
[03:34:00]  I couldn't sleep.  Like, earlier in my career,  I couldn't sleep the day before.  You were in your head  a lot there.  It was unbelievable  because you always make  scenarios and if you do that  and I'm going to do this  and sometimes you see  yourself win  and sometimes you see  yourself lose.  Like my last couple fights,  it's always the same.  But the difference  between now and before  is before I, you know,  I was so nervous  and I thought it was not normal.  I was thinking,  like, shit, I'm not sleeping.  But my opponent  is probably sleeping  like a baby.  He has an advantage on me. 
[03:34:30]  But nowadays,  I know how I am  and I know it's normal  so I know how to deal  with it a little bit better.  I'm still nervous  but I know how to deal.  When you fought Matt Sarah,  that's the one thing  they say,  you were in your head,  you kept saying,  I'm in my head all the time  and then when you went back  and beat him  and got your butt back.  I fought, yeah,  I fought Matt Sarah twice  but I would say  the fight that I sleep the less,  it was my first fight  with Matthews.  I did not sleep  almost a week  and sometimes I was,  even when I was sleeping,  I thought I was awake.  Wow, man. 
[03:35:00]  It was a crazy feeling.  I was dead.  I remember after the fight  when all the stress went down,  I lost that fight,  I slept like a baby  for more than 12 hours.  But you start to,  when you need to sleep,  you start to panic  as time gets on.  I'm not going to be able to sleep.  I'm not going to be able to sleep  and then that keeps you awake.  It becomes this fucking self-fulfilling thing.  And then don't forget  you have the weight cut.  You're losing weight  for the weight cut.  Sometimes you lose  15 pounds,  20 pounds,  plus all that  additionate,  plus the stress of the fight  is crazy.  It's like everything  that leads up to the fight 
[03:35:30]  takes away from  what you need to fight.  It just takes away  like all the stress,  the cutting the weight,  the lack of sleep.  That's why you need  to fuck somebody.  Just relax everything.  Lose some weight too,  by the way,  like a couple ounces.  Do you have,  and I have to ask you,  because they didn't want  to bring you and Ronda  in together.  Are you and Ronda okay  or do you not like her camp  or is there an issue there?  No, I'm fine.  I'm fine with it.  I'm not in bad terms  with nobody.  I have nobody 
[03:36:00]  that I'm in bad terms.  You and Nick Diaz  are friends again?  I have friends.  Like, that's the thing  with Nick Diaz.  I'm fine with Nick Diaz,  but I don't know  if he's fine with me.  For me,  it's not personal.  It's a fight.  Now it's over.  I'm happy.  I don't mind.  I'm good with everybody.  If you ask him that question,  maybe he'll have  a different answer.  I don't know.  Maybe he'll have  a different answer.  Some guys need  to psych themselves up,  I think,  to fight someone  and hate them.  Do you need to do that  or you can like somebody  and fight them anyway?  That's even scarier.  I would not like  fighting a friend, 
[03:36:30]  but I don't like  to hate the guy.  I fought a lot of guys  that were a nice guy,  but most of them  they try to be arrogant.  Isn't it like  an old school way  of fighting  is that hatred  and that...  You know why  it's like that?  Because the promoter,  the people that promote  the fight,  they like to create  a story.  The real story is...  We don't hate each other.  We just want to be  the best at what we do  because it's a fight.  It's a full-contact sport.  They feel like  they need to create  that animosity.  And it's true 
[03:37:00]  that build up,  like make a story,  it leads more people  to look at it.  You know what?  Because people identify  themselves to this.  If they only talk  about fighting  or they're fighting  for the title  to see who's the best,  people they can identify  themselves because  they don't do  the same job as us.  But if they fight  about...  They talk about  two guys  that hate each other,  now they will  identify themselves  to this  and tune up  to the fight.  I gotta be honest  with you.  When I'm watching  a fight  and I see  in between rounds  like the bell ring,  they're ready  to go to the corners  and they kind of 
[03:37:30]  tap each other's gloves  out of respect  like, hey,  that was a good round.  I kind of get like,  ah, shit.  Like they're kind of  respecting each other.  I like that, though.  I'd rather they keep  fighting after the bell.  They gotta be broken up.  They're clawing at each other  and then they go to the corners  because you know  they just...  I like when they beat the...  I don't do that, me.  I mean, if the guy...  Let's put it this way.  If the guy  tempt his glove,  I'm gonna give it the glove.  But if he doesn't,  I'm not gonna do it.  Because, like you see,  Carlos Condit and I 
[03:38:00]  were on a very good term  but we never once  touched a glove.  See, I would keep  my glove out the whole time.  Because I'm not  a hypocrite guy.  I come here  to knock you out  or to submit you.  I'm not trying  to be nice.  I shake it in after.  After, right, right.  Not here during the fight.  If I understand  what it like me,  I don't like that.  I did it a couple times  because a guy  gave it to me.  You don't want to be rude.  And sometimes  it's a reflex, you know,  they don't think about it.  It's like a sparring reflex  but I don't...  I love when a couple guys  in a round  are beating the shit  like really beating 
[03:38:30]  the shit, fighting  beating the shit  out of each other  and then they'll tap it.  Like, that was good.  I don't mind after the fight  when the fight's over  and they kind of  give a hug  or, you know,  that was good.  But during the fight,  I like thinking  that they don't like  each other for some reason.  I like that illusion  that they are fighting  for more than just,  you know,  the sport.  That maybe there is.  You know,  this guy's a fucking asshole  and I want to punch him  in the face.  Yeah, it makes more emotion.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Do you...  Now you're going to have  to go up  or you're going to have  to either go up 
[03:39:00]  and fight Silver  or fight Hendricks.  I know you don't know  what you're going to do yet  but what do you want to do?  That's one thing, okay?  If I go up,  I'm not going to go back down.  Some guy go up, down,  they play with their weight,  I don't know how they do it.  I mean,  I have an idea  but I don't do that.  I don't know how they do that.  Go up and down.  If I go up,  it's going to take  a certain amount of time  because I cannot go up  to gain that much weight.  I can.  Easy.  That could be...  But Silver 
[03:39:30]  is like 230 pounds  to walk around.  I'm 190 pounds.  It's a big weight difference.  That's heavyweight.  230 pounds is heavyweight.  Yeah, but you cut down.  I don't know how they do that  but the thing is me,  if I go up,  it will take  a certain amount of time  and the other guy  will have to go down  so I want to make sure  I do everything  I have to do in my division  before I go up.  And don't forget,  you know,  Silver has a big fight now.  He's fighting Chris Whiteman.  I know Chris Whiteman  and it pisses me off.  You know,  people look past Chris Whiteman. 
[03:40:00]  He's a badass.  He's amazing.  He's the best guy  I've ever fought.  I'm telling you right now  and I believe  Chris Whiteman will win.  He knocked a guy,  his last fight  knocked a guy with an elbow  but it looked like a punch.  Like he threw the elbow  like a punch.  Like jumped.  Knocked him the fuck out.  He's a badass.  They're telling us  we have to rap with GSP.  It's not that we want to  but they're telling us  we have to.  He's a busy man.  Yeah,  he is on the press.  So the promotion  is for the book.  It's called  The Way of the Fight.  What I've read of it,  I loved.  It was really,  really interesting 
[03:40:30]  and it wasn't cheesy  inspirational.  It was actually really,  you put some great stuff  about mediocrity  and about people  achieving greatness  and it was,  you know,  how people will settle  on mediocrity  and it was really  a very interesting point.  It's not a biography.  It's not a book  also for MMA  hardcore fans.  The MMA hardcore fans  will be disappointed  if they buy that book  and they think  it's about that.  It's about,  it's a lot of philosophy.  I love that.  It's basically  the tactic  and it's the way I, 
[03:41:00]  the thing is  I use in my life  where I start to reach  where I am right now  and it's,  it's,  it's,  I think it's someone,  everyone can apply this  for their own life,  you know,  like business  or whoever,  you know,  they can use that  to their own ways,  you know.  And you can,  if you want to get a copy  of the book  and meet George,  you can,  at bookends tonight  in East Ridgewood,  New Jersey,  I've been there.  It's a great place.  Cause it's all inside.  So you're not going to be  standing outside in the wind  like an asshole.  It's,  uh,  uh, 
[03:41:30]  eight o'clock tonight.  Yeah.  Cause there's nothing worse  than standing in the wind  with a book.  But,  uh,  or you can go to the book  review,  uh,  tomorrow in Huntington,  uh,  over in Long Island.  If you don't want to come out  tonight,  that's at seven o'clock  and,  uh,  and,  uh,  George St. Pierre,  but there is an S after George.  So don't forget that on Twitter.  So you're not following the wrong account.  Exactly.  And,  um,  I guess,  uh,  we have to wrap up the show.  Does Anthony have to do a read or?  Yeah,  of course.  But,  uh,  thanks for coming in.  I always get,  I don't know if I should take a punch or not.  I always get the fighters to do one thing to me 
[03:42:00]  before they leave.  Do something.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Rhonda put me in an armbar.  Can I do an eye gouge?  I don't know if I'm kidding.  Like kick,  kick,  kick to the balls.  I would love to see that.  Something illegal.  Something illegal.  But no,  I don't like you to go full out.  Just like light,  like,  you know,  not too crazy,  but I want to bite him.  How funny would it be if he did gouge my eye  and kick me in the balls?  It wouldn't be funny at all.  I guess I'll take a,  would you,  what do you want to do?  I do the,  the one inch punch.  Bruce Lee punch. 
[03:42:30]  One inch punch.  Hang on,  ready?  One,  can you do that?  One,  two,  three.  Hey!  Oh,  he just tapped me.  I don't want you to sue me.  Oh,  no,  I wouldn't.  I mean,  I do in the U.S.,  especially in New York,  you know there's a lot of sue.  I don't want to get sued.  I know,  I know.  This damn country and the lawyers.  New York,  you know.  Exactly.  People sued each other.  It's a smart man.  Well,  we got video of that,  so I already got what I need  for the big lawsuit.  That was agonizing.  The big lawsuit.  Yeah.  The big lawsuit.  Yeah.  You made me feel like a woman  down in the sill.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  George St. Pierre,  thank you very much.  Thank you,  guys.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  And now,  the Opie and Anthony show  continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host,  Sam Roberts.  Yes,  yes,  yes.  Make it red.  After Opie and Anthony Live  with my guest,  Bob Kelly.  It's actually called  The Bob and Sam Show.  Apparently,  I missed Rhonda's ass.  Oh,  God.  I didn't see it.  Well,  how could you miss it?  I don't know. 
[03:43:30]  I was...  She is unbelievably hot.  She was really sexy.  You felt her body  on top of your body.  I did,  yeah.  She took her thing off.  She is really beautiful,  man.  Yeah.  And she was...  I knew she'd be fun,  but she was really nice.  Like,  you never know if...  Like,  you know,  again,  it's a woman fighter  in a male sport.  Will she have that weird...  I have to prove myself.  Of course.  But she didn't.  She was just fun  and a really cool person.  She's talking about her titties?  Yeah.  It's great.  Well,  her last fight,  her boobs almost came out  like five times.  How did it feel  to have her on top of you? 
[03:44:00]  It really felt good.  She was being nice  because people told me  don't let her do it  because she'll fucking hurt you.  But she was...  I could see being next to her.  She was actually really nice.  But when she was on top  and she bent it back,  it wasn't agonizing  until that last second  and then I felt like,  wow,  because she ripped my one arm  off the other arm  and you understand  how fucked you are  at that moment.  Did she feel powerful?  Like,  the other guys,  they feel powerful.  Did she feel powerful  when she...  Yeah.  I mean,  you know,  the fact that she's a woman,  you're not thinking that. 
[03:44:30]  Like,  you're thinking like,  wow,  this is Rhonda's  beautiful legs around me  but you're thinking,  all right,  I'm in a fucking bad spot here.  But it wasn't...  At least it had to be  a little more sexual  than when BJ Penn  had his legs wrapped around you.  Yeah,  okay.  But it didn't feel sexual at all,  honestly.  Did it feel less sexual  because there wasn't  a penis on your elbow?  Yeah,  I wasn't used to it.  It's actually a real woman.  But no,  I didn't,  you know,  because it just...  You know that she's showing you  a move that can really  fuck you up.  Yeah.  She's pretty badass.  Yeah.  And she's gorgeous. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah,  she really is gorgeous.  You know,  most athlete,  like a lot of the women,  don't have a butt.  You know what I mean?  Or it's like squared off  or angled.  Yeah.  Like a guy butt.  Yeah.  She was smoking hot.  Yeah.  It was a nice round.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hello.  I almost said it.  It almost came out.  I was like,  wow,  what an ass.  Mars,  you're an ass aficionado  over there.  And a UFC guy.  Well,  yeah,  but more importantly.  That's funny.  Wow,  what an ass.  That's what she wanted to say  when she walked in. 
[03:45:30]  She could roll asses.  Go ahead,  Mars,  your turn.  How was it?  Did you see her ass?  Round is fine.  Yeah.  It's completely fine.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  She's the whole package.  Not like fine,  like foin.  Like F-O-I-N-E.  Mars said when she's like,  yeah,  she's fine when she took  her thing off,  which is,  you know,  she's a fucking female champion  and he's fucking going,  mommy,  mommy.  You said that to her?  Like you said,  damn,  she's.  Thank you.  Really?  Who's this little kid?  Oh,  it's bringing her kid  to work day,  I guess.  Oh,  Jesus Christ. 
[03:46:00]  Friggin' Paul.  Yeah,  really?  Hey,  Mars,  is George St. Pierre,  do you,  is he the best fighter,  whatever,  yeah,  they're all on.  Pound for pound.  Pound for pound.  Is he the best fighter  in the world?  Arguably.  I would,  you know,  that argument can be made,  but what do you think?  That's rough,  man,  because you got John Jones  and you got Anderson Silver.  John Jones is up there now  officially,  huh?  This is rough.  So I would,  he's my favorite fighter.  John Jones?  GSP.  GSP's your favorite fighter.  But a lot of people  don't like, 
[03:46:30]  don't like him  because he's not finishing  the fight.  He doesn't finish,  he goes to decisions.  But he beats your ass.  There's nothing you can do about it.  Everybody that's fought him  and hasn't been knocked out.  Right.  Certainly felt  their eye sockets  almost coming out.  You know,  they felt all that pain.  Yeah,  but it's a different thing  when you're watching the fight  and you see  even Silver  at the end  with Chael  coming back to win  with a triangle,  beating the shit out of people,  knocking people out,  finishing people.  And then you got George 
[03:47:00]  who's going the five rounds.  You know,  people who aren't fans  of the sport  are like,  ah,  they don't like that shit.  They're like a champion  finishing fights,  devastating their opponents.  And George goes,  and he said it,  that's the way I fight.  If you don't like it,  you might not like it,  whatever,  but that's the way I fight.  As a casual fan,  because I'm completely  a casual fan,  I watch a fight  every like four months  or something.  You're just casual  in general.  That's my vibe.  I would call you just casual  in everything you do.  Cash.  Just cash,  you know? 
[03:47:30]  Except for your hair.  It's a little outlandish.  Outlandish.  I think so.  I like,  I far prefer watching  a Jon Jones fight,  far prefer watching  an Anderson Silva fight  than a GSP fight.  That's when you're expected.  When you actually,  you know,  take or try to do it,  you know,  you know that  what's going on in that ring,  that guy's smashing you  from the five fucking rounds.  You don't have to,  I think that's kind of bullshit,  too.  I hate when people say that.  When you do the sport,  you don't have to fucking do  jiu-jitsu 
[03:48:00]  or fucking train  to appreciate the fight.  You just need to know  about jiu-jitsu.  You need to know  about wrestling.  You need to know  about the sport of MMA  to watch him  knowing what he's doing,  knowing his tactic.  He's taking him down.  He's scoring a point.  Then he's ground and pounding.  He's getting points.  But don't you think  you gain a greater appreciation  for it when you do it?  You don't have to, though.  I hate when people say that.  You don't have to.  When you train,  you...  It's better.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  It's not better.  It's better if you actually feel me 
[03:48:30]  smashing your face  with my chest.  I'm not hitting.  I'm just saying  I'm just laying on you, right?  And I'm working on you  and I'm smashing you.  Slow down, slow down.  What are you doing?  We get on the floor  and there's some  that Ronda Rousey stuff.  Wait a minute.  You're laying on me.  Yeah, I'm laying on you.  Is Sam there  or Sam not there?  No, I'm there.  Sam's there.  I'm in a corner.  I'm in a dark corner.  You have a lamp  with a dimmer on it  that keeps going up and down,  up and down,  up and down.  That has a sound.  I like that.  Oh, yeah.  It needs a little oil in it.  Okay, so you're on me. 
[03:49:00]  Go ahead.  So I'm on you now.  I'm moving around.  Moving around.  You're going around.  You're switching positions.  There you go.  And as I'm doing that,  I am smashing you  at the same time.  Smashing.  Oh, smashing.  Ah, smashing.  I don't think you need to know.  I don't think I need to.  I'm right there with you right now.  I get it.  I get it.  Do you get it, Sam?  Yeah, I get it.  Do you get it?  Just say yes.  Yes, I have a mic.  But don't you think  like you watch comedy  differently than a spectator?  Like, I could watch 
[03:49:30]  every comedian  and still not have  the same appreciation  for it that you do.  First of all,  I don't like your  good example.  Fuck yourself  with proving me wrong.  Second of all,  no.  No, not at all.  You're absolutely right,  but no,  I don't think that.  Right, because it doesn't  fit your argument.  I understand.  No, I know what he's saying.  I just hate when...  I hate when...  Because you don't break...  You hate it  because you don't do jujitsu.  No, 90...  And you want to be  number one fan.  No, 90% of the fans  that like the sport  don't fucking train. 
[03:50:00]  And the people  who are paying the bills  don't train.  Right.  There's thousands,  millions of people  who love the sport  and they're not going  to a gym every Wednesday.  They don't love it  like Mars.  And plus,  how many times  do you train?  What belt do you?  I'm a brown belt.  Okay, how many times  a week do you train?  Four times.  Really?  Really?  I would think  you'd be in better shape.  You know, Sam...  That's the only thing.  Those lies.  Those lies don't work.  No, he's instructor shape.  Is that what it is?  You know,  the instructors  are always fat  and not as great  as the fighters themselves. 
[03:50:30]  It's always so...  Because he's just demoing.  He's not actually...  Yeah, he's demoing  and he's eating pasta.  Hold on.  Got a carload, babe.  Got a class.  It's not fun.  Okay, all right.  You're calling me fat.  Yeah, well,  you're kind of in shape,  which is worse.  Would you tell him  I'm in shape?  You're not in shape.  You're in a shape.  I'm in shape, my friend.  That shape is round,  you know what I'm saying?  Let me see.  Pull up your shirt.  Anyway.  Now get on top.  Okay, there was some jiggle  in the titty  when you pulled up your shirt  just now.  Just a little jiggle. 
[03:51:00]  You know what you are?  You're Mexican in shape.  There's no Mexican fighter  with abs, full abs.  Right.  He's got like two, four,  but there's always  that little punch  from tacos on the weekend.  Yeah, he can't let it go.  And beers.  Hey, but when you do  go see these fights,  and you're right,  there's like 80, 90%  of the people that are there,  they don't train,  but they're the first ones  to start booing  because they don't understand  what the hell's going on.  First of all,  that's not true in every case. 
[03:51:30]  I don't like the fans  that boo because they don't  understand what's going on,  but they're also,  you understand,  when Pride was fighting,  if the action was slowed down,  you'd get 5% of your purse  taken away.  You get a card.  You get a red card.  You get a yellow card  and a red card,  I believe it is.  I might be wrong.  And if you weren't  pressing the action,  you got your money  taken away.  Okay.  Do you understand?  That's booing.  So when there's,  I understand they boo,  sometimes it's stupid shit,  but sometimes they're booing  when it's like,  let's go, motherfucker. 
[03:52:00]  I paid good money  to see you fight.  Stop leaning on somebody.  Stop hanging against the cage  for five minutes.  But right there,  that leaning on somebody,  that's actually doing something.  See, you wouldn't get that, Bob.  You don't train.  I do get it,  but it's funny.  You wouldn't understand that.  Here's the thing, though.  I get it.  I've seen what Mars does,  and it's a skill.  You've never seen me do anything.  You're right.  I've seen you sit there  with your thumb up your ass  and talk about how good shape you're in.  And I'm good at it.  You know what Mars does?  The first 30 minutes of every class  is him throwing punches,  like the karate kid.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. 
[03:52:30]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  One, two, three, four, five.  Change positions.  So you don't think  Chael Sonnen has a shot  against Jon Jones this weekend?  I've never said that.  Well, you said Jon Jones  was possibly the best player  in the world pound for pound  at top three.  Possibly, yes.  Do you think  Chael Sonnen can beat him?  Chael Sonnen was in this week, obviously.  He'll be on the countdown  over the weekend, but...  I can tell you.  I'll tell you right now  that he's capable  of putting him on his back  maybe for a second or so.  But Jon Jones is...  I think even on his back 
[03:53:00]  he's going to be able  to sweep and turn things around.  So Jon Jones wins?  Let's be honest.  Jon Jones wins.  Let's be honest.  Jon Jones is a heavyweight.  Yes, absolutely right.  You're absolutely right.  This is a big dude.  He doesn't belong in this division.  Jon Jones is not light heavyweight.  Jon Jones can make light heavyweight,  but he's a heavyweight fighter.  So he's going to win.  If you watch his fights,  they look cartoonish  because he's so much bigger.  He's so much better.  And reach.  And then his other opponent...  Rashad fight?  Watch any of the...  When they start...  His opponents are always looking up.  Yesterday. 
[03:53:30]  Fucking weird.  Their necks are hurting  because they have to look up to him.  Yesterday, Chael said  that the smaller guy  has the advantage.  Is that something  the small guy says?  When he...  When he said that,  keep in mind  that we're talking about  the same division, though.  He doesn't mean, like,  you know,  if I'm 150 pounds,  I'm going to take on a 230.  230, yeah.  If I'm in the same  light heavyweight division  at 205,  well, he's saying  that the lighter guy  has more speed.  And maybe he's saying that  because he's the lighter guy.  That's what I'm saying.  But when you've got a bigger guy 
[03:54:00]  that is just as good as you,  just as fast,  the little guy has a problem.  But you know what  Chael Sonnen can do  better than Jon Jones?  Speak.  Talk people into a building.  That's true.  Sell tickets.  He is good.  You know?  He is good.  But what happened...  That's why UFC  is so fucked up to me  because of my world  that I've surrounded myself  in for so long.  Like, I'm sitting here going,  Chael Sonnen is a guy  that can talk people  into a building.  So in my mind,  this is a guy  who should have  a career forever.  He should be in main events  just forever.  But if he keeps losing fights,  he can't. 
[03:54:30]  No, he's been...  He's lost every fight.  He's...  The last two fights,  he's lost...  Not the last two.  He's lost to Silva twice.  He went and just got  a championship fight  because of his mouth.  He got another one  because of his mouth.  But how long can that last  in UFC?  Apparently forever  because he got another one  in another division  right away.  You don't like that?  I don't give a fuck about it.  I don't...  Look, I like fights.  I love seeing...  I love this weekend's fights.  I like talking.  I love...  I love talking.  That's why you're radio. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, baby.  Radio Sam.  I love the fights.  This fight this weekend  with Chael and Jones,  I can't wait for it.  It's great.  I know the outcome.  I think Jones is gonna  kill him,  but you never know  with a fight.  You never...  George St. Pierre  got knocked the fuck out,  lost his belt  to Matt Serra.  What do you think  of all the talking?  Do you like somebody  like Chael Sonnen?  I like Chael Sonnen.  As a matter of fact,  I didn't like him  at first.  Right.  Until he came here.  Because he disrespected 
[03:55:30]  the sport that you train in?  No, not at all.  Is that it?  No.  It was just the whole  WWE shit talking.  They don't talk like that  in the dojo?  Nobody's stealing  superstar Billy Graham lines?  You respect in the dojo.  Oh.  He threw Brazil...  He threw jiu-jitsu  under the bus.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, he said it just stinks.  Go fuck yourself.  And I'll tell you what,  the wrestlers...  Yeah.  You mean real wrestlers.  Wrestlers' strength,  like Chael and those...  Fucking...  Brock!  It's stupid strength, though. 
[03:56:00]  There's nothing...  There's nothing that can beat  a guy that can just  take you to the ground  and throw you on your head  and hold you down.  You're absolutely right.  I agree with that.  And they didn't have that  back when the Gracies  and the UFC won.  Wrestlers didn't know...  They had wrestlers,  but they didn't have  the motherfuckers.  Now,  none of the fact that  the guy knows  how to get out of a move  and throw a punch  and take you down,  I think Chael does have  a fighting chance,  but Jones is a wrestler, too.  Jones is not a championship, 
[03:56:30]  not like Chael,  but he's up there.  I love watching  John Jones fight.  And maybe that's because  he's cool with me  when he comes up here.  I don't know,  but I love watching him fight.  But I was saying,  my perspective,  in terms of how much  I like Chael Sutton...  That's because you're  from New Rock.  Is that it?  Yeah, man.  New Rock City!  Yo!  Ray Rice,  Super Bowl champion,  New Row, what?  What?  Anyway.  Yes.  Back to the Bob and Sam show.  Right.  I don't know if that's  what we're going with  with the name. 
[03:57:00]  We might switch that.  Bob and Sam.  My perspective on this UFC...  Hashtag Bob and Sam.  We'll go Sam Bob  for the hashtag,  at least.  Hashtag Bob and Sam.  Maybe like BS,  because that's what it is.  My favorite...  You like that?  You could always  turn off the mic.  I know,  but that's not how  I play the game.  You can't do that  in the Bob and Sam show.  What's wrong with you?  I'm sorry,  I was just talking to you.  I don't use this  as a source of power.  It's not how I play the game.  Really?  That's news to me.  I don't do that.  You know what, Mark?  You can have all the news  you want.  Nobody can hear you. 
[03:57:30]  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  You know what, though?  I mean, he's so honorable  in the dojo,  but then he'd do  some type of evil move  like that.  Right.  Like, turn my mic down.  I think you need  to talk to your master.  I was going to say,  my favorite moment  in all the UFC  that I've ever seen  was Brock Lesnar,  after his fight,  shitting all over Budweiser,  the sponsor,  and saying,  I'm going to go  have a course light.  Like, to me,  when he just started  shooting off at the mouth,  I'm like,  greatest thing I've ever seen.  And I was watching  with a room full of people  who actually, like,  are MMA fans, 
[03:58:00]  and they're all going,  oh, what a fucking asshole.  This is terrible.  That's not what this is about.  And I'm arguing,  this is great.  What are you talking about?  Me and Jimmy were there.  You were?  Oh, it was so great.  Yeah, it was, right?  But that's good for business  because people now  want to go buy tickets  to watch him get his ass kicked.  I was mad, too,  but I knew why I was mad  because I'm a wrestling fan.  Right.  He's a heel.  You're supposed to be mad.  I was just as mad  when I watched him in wrestling  and he came out  with that stupid walk.  What's he saying  about Stephanie McMahon?  No. 
[03:58:30]  Joe,  Brother Joe,  is on the hotline.  What's up?  What's up, buddy?  How you doing, man?  I just wanted to do...  I watched on the UFC channel  the other day.  I watched...  Who was it?  Come on.  Tim Sylvia  when he fought Randy Couture.  When Randy Couture  made his comeback.  Yeah.  It was a while ago.  But you were talking  about the smaller guy  having the advantage.  Tim Sylvia being 6'8  and having a reach  of like 85 inches.  The guy was huge.  I mean,  you know,  Randy Couture  is not a short guy.  You know, 
[03:59:00]  in the octagon with him  he looked like a...  He looked miniature  and he just beat  the crap out of him, man.  But here's the thing, though.  It's a different UFC, too.  Tim Sylvia,  back then,  he was the champ.  But the champ...  The caliber of fighter  in the weight classes now  has totally changed,  I believe.  The UFC is a totally different sport.  How long ago was that?  That's...  What?  Five, six years ago?  Okay.  It was like a...  Yeah, something like that.  It's crazy. 
[03:59:30]  Like, the guy...  The heavyweights now  that are fighting  are the top guys  in the world  and they know everything.  They know how to fight.  They know jiu-jitsu.  They know wrestling.  It's not like  karate guy versus wrestler anymore.  Well, I mean,  look, Randy Couture was...  He was a championship wrestler  and that was at  his kind of peak.  I mean,  he was light heavyweight champ  and he was heavyweight champ.  I mean,  he was at his peak  at that point.  He was really kicking ass.  That's true.  I guess comparing  that fight  to what goes on today  in the octagon 
[04:00:00]  is kind of like  comparing Dan Severn  being a legitimate MMA guy.  Yeah.  Well, here's the thing.  It's like, you know,  Jon Jones  is fucking great.  Chael Sonnen is great.  They're two fucking  unbelievable fighters.  How would Dan Severn  do in an octagon now?  With his mustache?  With his mustache.  Because he has the mustache,  that gives him his strength.  He would kill.  He would kill everybody.  All right.  Thanks, brother Joe.  See you later, brother.  I think Dan Severn  fought not too long ago.  Maybe two months ago.  Bobby and Sam show,  by the way.  We go Sam and Bob. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah, but not in UFC.  No, no, of course not.  Of course not.  But he's trying.  Dan Severn.  I know.  That's the saddest part  about this sport.  That, you know,  that's like, you know.  Give it up, man.  Around 10 years  of Voss is trying  to, you know,  do a show.  Not at Caroline's,  but like in front  of Caroline's.  Racist Francesa  has a question for Bob.  Racist Francesa,  by the way,  he calls the after show  out of character.  And that's something  we bring.  Really?  Well, the Bob and Sam show.  Go ahead.  That's correct.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning. 
[04:01:00]  You have to drop the shield.  But I like the fucking,  Bobby, I like your take, man.  You're a fight expert, man.  Sonnen and Jones is good,  but let's talk about  a real fight.  Who wins?  Cena or Ryback?  Come on.  Give it to me, big boy.  Who wins, Bobby?  I think I'm going to have to.  Look, I think Cena  is a little out of his league.  I think Ryback.  I guess Ryback?  Listen, Ryback,  feed me more, baby.  Yeah, you're a Ryback guy.  Feed me more.  I like how one of his  nipples is always out.  I think...  He went through a period  where he had pink eye  in every match. 
[04:01:30]  I know, right?  I think that Ryback  is going to...  He's going to be  the next big motherfucker.  He's going to be  the next face.  He's going to take the belt.  He's going to put a pounding  on Cena,  and he's going to use  the shield to do it.  I think you're right  about Ryback being  the next guy.  I don't think it's going  to happen just now, though.  Oh, of course it can't  happen now.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't we prolong  this for a year?  Well, and also,  I think, you know,  John Cena's not going  to give up his spot  anytime soon.  Yeah, but people are  getting...  You can hear Cena's  getting...  Rock...  What The Rock did  is fucked Cena. 
[04:02:00]  Because Cena,  before The Rock came back  and started calling him out  and you can't see me  and Froot Loops  and all that shit.  Just destroying  every catchphrase  and every t-shirt.  I mean, Cena did  the same thing  to The Rock, though.  He fucking exposed him  for a fight.  Yeah, because Dummy  had his promo...  The Rock comes back,  and he's like  the number one promo guy,  and this asshole  has his promo  written on his hand.  And he called him out.  And Cena, like,  for real,  not as part of the storyline,  comes to the ring  and points out,  like, yo,  what's on your hand, buddy?  Ah, that's fucked up, though. 
[04:02:30]  And The Rock got  fucking pissed.  You could see it  in his face.  It got him pissed,  but it also fucked him up  because he started...  He wasn't The Rock  after that.  Well, please.  Have you seen  The Rock wrestle this year?  He's not The Rock anymore.  Of course he's not The Rock,  but he's still The Rock, dude.  But he's not The Rock.  That fucking music happens,  he comes out,  fuck you, dude.  No, he's not.  Did he bring it?  No, he's not.  His cardio is terrible.  He's blown up  five minutes into a match.  Well, he got hurt, right?  And yeah,  and he got hurt  at WrestleMania.  Did he?  Severely, too.  Yeah, it's like...  Wasn't it...  It was like his ab  or his pelvis  or something like that.  The muscle got torn off. 
[04:03:00]  Like, he missed  the stupid premiere  of whatever movie he's in,  Pain and Gain,  because he had to go  get surgery on it.  Oh, my God.  They had to move  his intestines  and stuff around.  You know, they were actually,  I was reading,  in...  His what?  His intestines.  Intestines.  They had to rearrange everything.  They were going to set up  a story between The Rock  and Brock Lesnar  right after WrestleMania.  And The Rock  flew out of town  right after WrestleMania  because he was like,  my shit is fucked up.  I have a rumor 
[04:03:30]  that I want you to  tell me if it's true or not.  Did The Rock get into a fight  with Vince McMahon  after WrestleMania?  No, he didn't get into a fight.  People are saying  on the internet  that he left  without telling anyone.  That he just...  And then he was just...  They were like,  we have you ready for Raw.  And he was like,  good, I'm not in town.  I left.  But he says that  everybody knew  that he was not going to be there.  Right.  But he was...  Scheduled.  Scheduled to be at that Raw  and that's when they were going to start  a Brock Lesnar deal with him.  Well, they need to bring  CM back into the fold  and let him be the guy. 
[04:04:00]  Punk's leaving for a little while.  Why?  He's got to take some time off.  He's been carrying that shit.  Yeah, he's...  But he...  But you know what Michael Bay said  that bothered me?  You know who Michael Bay is.  He's the guy who did  Transformers and all that.  Yeah.  He's at this premiere,  right?  And The Rock no-showed  because he had his  pelvis shit messed up.  Yeah.  And some reporter  asked him about it  and he said,  yeah, The Rock...  I mean, I guess he was joking.  Yeah.  But he goes,  yeah, The Rock had to  miss the premiere  to go get surgery.  The Rock's got to grow up  and stop wrestling  300-pound men. 
[04:04:30]  And I'm like,  this motherfucker,  this 50-year-old dude  who's directing  Transformers and Ninja Turtles  movies  is telling people  to grow up.  And they're not 300-pound,  by the way.  There's around  maybe two of those.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tybeck and Big Show.  I'd say between  230 and 250.  Yeah.  I mean,  those are athletes,  motherfucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Grow up, he says.  Well, should he grow up  and chase a fake robot  on a green screen?  Yeah, what the fuck  are you talking about,  Michael Bay?  Should he talk to a  fucking tennis ball  like it's a monster?  Go fuck yourself. 
[04:05:00]  Michael Bay,  the greatest action  director of all time  except James Cameron.  How do you like that?  Michael Bay  lives his entire life  realizing he didn't  make Avatar.  How does that feel?  Making another  Transformers movies.  Bitch.  Yeah, well,  he's making it  with Mark Wahlberg now.  Pain and Gain?  No, the new Transformers.  That's what Marky Mark  is doing now?  First of all,  his name's not Marky Mark.  It is if he's  in the Transformers.  Whoa.  You know who you  want to say that to?  Marky Mark.  I dare you to fucking...  He said he told TMZ  he would bring back 
[04:05:30]  the Funky Bunch  to benefit Boston.  Would he?  Yeah, that's what  he told TMZ.  I tell you this,  I met him at a party once.  I went to this party  in L.A.  It was the most  surreal fucking party  I've ever been to.  How'd you get in?  Me and Dane  were going to...  He goes,  I'm going to this party.  You want to go?  I'm like,  well, I don't give a fuck.  We pull up.  Everybody thought  I was Michael Chiklis,  by the way.  I'm not even kidding.  We get out.  As we go into the party...  It's some house.  It's like a fuck...  What are you doing?  Keep talking.  It's radio. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah, but what are you doing?  There's no visual element.  Just keep fucking talking.  First of all,  don't ever swear at me  on the Bob and Sam show.  Hashtag Bob and Sam.  Listen.  I have a live read  somewhere in this room  Okay.  So anyways.  Yeah, ask for help, asshole.  Just keep going, man.  I'd stop yelling.  Keep fucking talking.  This show is not going to work  if you have this fucking attitude, man.  I think one of the interns  might have thrown it out.  I'm going to talk to somebody  about this.  Talk to the audience.  I'm going to talk to the management  about your attitude.  Is it a Stephen Singer? 
[04:06:30]  All right.  So I walked in...  As you were saying, Bobby.  Thank you, Mars.  Thank you very much, Mars.  I walked in.  Dustin Hoffman walked by me.  Lawrence Fishborn  was right in front of me.  Fishborn?  Fishborn?  Fishborn.  Whatever the fuck his name is.  Fishborn.  Whatever his name is.  Did you call him Curtis?  The guy who had the daughter  who fucking banged some dudes.  Cowboy Curtis.  We, uh...  And then, um...  Marky Mark is walking out.  It's Mark Wahlberg.  Marky Wahlberg.  Marky Wahlberg.  What's up, Marky Wahlberg? 
[04:07:00]  And I know his brother.  I'm friends with his brother.  Donnie?  No, Jimbo.  Who's a great guy.  I guess, but he's not one of the...  You know...  He is.  Is he the one that owns the burger joint?  No.  Not even that one, huh?  Wahlberg.  Look, man.  First of all, these guys will all punch you  in the face of the video.  You're right.  You're right.  They're from Dorchester.  Let's not get carried away with your...  Hey, I'm on the radio.  I'm safe.  Because I will tell them where you live.  I got all excited about the Michael Bay thing.  And I apologize.  Settle down.  I apologize.  That's reality.  Yeah, you're right, Mark.  But he's walking out.  And this is what a piece of shit I am. 
[04:07:30]  I went, hey...  I go, hey, Mark.  How you doing?  I know your brother.  I'm friends with your brother.  And he stopped.  He goes, good.  Tell him I said hi.  And he just fucking left.  And we're just sitting there like...  Yeah.  I deserve that.  Yeah, that's exactly what that should have gotten.  I think Dustin Hoffman rolled his eyes.  One of these.  Listen.  There's one thing that can make you feel better, Bobby.  I know.  I know what makes me feel better.  Makes you feel better every day.  What?  When I go to...  Yo, Snoop Dogg just walked me.
