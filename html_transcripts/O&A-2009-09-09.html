<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion sparked by President Obama's speech urging schoolchildren to stay in school. Opie, Anthony, and frequent guest Jimmy Norton, all high school dropouts, felt personally insulted by Obama's implication that dropping out was unpatriotic. This led to a debate about the value of higher education, the high cost of college, student loan debt, and the effectiveness of social programs. Callers shared diverse opinions, with some expressing cynicism about politics and the government's perceived overreach, particularly regarding taxation and gun control. One caller, "Rape Kit," directly challenged Anthony's perspective. Despite their initial objections, the hosts ultimately conceded that the speech's core message was positive.

The show then shifted to other topics.  The hosts discussed Bloomberg's failed soda tax, Obama's alleged smoking habits, and exorbitant healthcare costs, criticizing individuals who utilize Medicaid due to obesity.  Listener calls further fueled this discussion, focusing on personal responsibility and the healthcare system.  The hosts also critiqued John Sterling's Yankees home run calls as "douchey" and debated the quality of the remastered Beatles catalog, playing comparisons of original and remastered versions of "Let It Be" and "I Am the Walrus," as well as a listener-submitted remaster of Foundry's "What Kills Me."  The segment concluded with a humorous, but offensive, bit about Mike Kennedy's death and the announcement of Bob Kelly as an upcoming guest.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to sports.  The hosts discussed the Pittsburgh Pirates' long losing streak, the Yankees and Red Sox, and John Sterling's commentary, including potentially offensive remarks. Callers shared anecdotes about the Pirates' struggles, low ticket prices, and a planned fan boycott, leading to a discussion of revenue sharing in baseball.  The Pirates' merchandise, possibly linked to gang colors, sparked a discussion about gang-related paraphernalia and improvised weapons.  The show also featured an in-depth analysis of REO Speedwagon's "Riding the Storm Out," with a caller providing historical context to the song's various recordings. This segment concluded with discussion of the "Sex and the City" movie, Kim Cattrall, and a graphic anecdote about a prolapsed anus, followed by further discussion of "cougars" like Courtney Cox,  more promotion of Bob Kelly's upcoming stand-up gigs, and the showing of a video depicting a prolapsed anus. Bob Kelly was a guest in the studio during this segment.

Another segment detailed Jimmy Norton's disastrous comedy performance in an upstate New York nightclub with a predominantly Black audience.  He recounted being heckled and physically confronted by both the MC and audience members.  This led to a discussion of Grandma Lee, a 75-year-old comedian on America's Got Talent, and a phone call with Bill Burr, covering topics ranging from a coyote encounter to cynicism about modern technology. A video of a new advanced robot dog was shown.  Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, and Jim Norton were in-studio guests for this segment.

The final segment revolved around Opie and Bobby's planned fly fishing trip, the “Match in the Hatch Weekend." The conversation involved sexually explicit banter, a caller's joke about Bobby, and discussions about trip logistics, including accommodation and the potential need for a guide (J.W. Trout).  A lengthy and graphic discussion about self-fellatio ensued, followed by arguments about the trip's preparation and equipment.  The segment also included mentions of Bob Kelly's upcoming comedy shows and Jim Jefferies as a future guest. Several runner-up lines of the day were also mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Arrgh! Arrgh, I say!  So the Obama thing is pissing you off?  We should get right into the Obama thing.  I'd already started yelling, uh, and then realized I'll bite my tongue...  Until the show starts.  ...and wait until, uh, the start of the program.  Yeah, because it just, uh... 
[00:00:30]  Obama, just day after day, he's saying things that just annoy me.  Ugh.  And he had a little chit-chat with some school children,  which was controversial, uh,  because a lot of parents were wondering what the hell this guy was going to say.  Right.  What the hell is he going to say?  So, uh, he, um, he released his speech, so, you know,  calmed the parents down because they thought he was going to go up there and say,  you know, get out there and wave a hammer and sickle flag and, you know, whatever. 
[00:01:00]  But apparently he was just talking about school and whatnot.  He's trying to keep him in school.  There's nothing wrong with that, Anthony.  Nothing wrong with that.  There was just one statement that really bothered you?  Well, yeah, yeah.  Wait till you actually hear it.  Personally insulted by our president.  Personally insulted, all right.  Personally insulted by our president.  Obama's sitting down with the kids.  What are you saying?  That's what I want to focus on today.  The responsibility each of you has for your education. 
[00:01:30]  I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself.  Every single one of you has something that you're good at.  Every single one of you has something to offer.  And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is.  That's the opportunity an education can provide.  So far, so good.  Is it?  Maybe you could be a great writer.  Maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper.  But you might not know it. 
[00:02:00]  Hold on.  Just a second.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Now, so far, so good.  Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  Wrote a book.  I wrote two, for fuck's sake.  Guy that doesn't know how to take a compliment.  Exactly.  Now, Jimmy Norton.  Let's just keep that in mind.  Jimmy Norton wrote two books.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe you could be a great writer.  Maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper.  But you might not know it.  Until you write that English paper. 
[00:02:30]  That English class paper that's assigned to you.  Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor.  Maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone or the new medicine or vaccine.  But you might not know it until you do your project for your science class.  He's missing out on one thing.  Yeah.  The world needs ditch.  Ditch diggers, too.  Ditch diggers, too, you know.  I'm sorry you can't come.  Right.  There's a reason why. 
[00:03:00]  Can't have everyone getting all the good jobs.  Well, here he goes.  Then nothing will get done.  He's off and running.  Until you do your project for your science class.  Right.  And no matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it.  Guarantees it.  You want to be a doctor or a teacher or a police officer.  Mm-hmm.  You want to be a nurse or an architect.  Mm-hmm.  A lawyer or a member of our military.  You're going to need a good education for every single one of those careers.  You cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  You can't, can you?  Mm-hmm.  You can't.  What happened?  You can't drop out of school and drop into a good job.  Right.  Just doesn't happen.  That's true.  That's ludicrous to even think that could possibly happen.  That's true.  Yeah.  You dropped into a good job in your 30s, though.  Look, I dropped out of school.  I dropped into a good job.  It took a while.  I didn't say there was some rough road in between the two, but you could graduate high school. 
[00:04:00]  You could have stayed in school and still have a shit job.  I went to, I worked in construction with lots of high school and college graduates.  Believe me.  And another man who might have not gone the full distance in school.  He wrote two books, apparently.  You bet he did.  For fuck's sake.  For fuck's sake.  A new book coming out, for fuck's sake.  We're both high school dropouts.  Yes.  And did very well with your lives.  Yes.  You know, through a little bit of luck and whatnot. 
[00:04:30]  But that's with anything.  That's if somebody graduates top of their class in college.  You still need a little bit of that luck and some natural talent and skill and panache and networking abilities.  But you really can't have Obama telling the kids that it's okay not to finish school.  No, but you know something?  Because we'd have a lot of dummies walking around thinking, you know, a job is going to drop on their laps.  If he said that, it would be outrageous.  You just can't have the president say that. 
[00:05:00]  This is a feel-good speech.  I understand that.  Okay.  But, you know, it's not very accurate.  It's not completely accurate.  It's accurate.  I'll give it to him.  It's extremely accurate.  I think as he goes on, it gets a little personal.  Okay.  What do you want him to say?  You have to say like this.  I understand.  I love the fact that I didn't graduate high school and that I have a great life.  And I love knowing that I did it and I did it the way I wanted to do it.  Mm-hmm.  God bless you because it was a – it seems to – what am I trying to say?  It seems a lot less pressure on you guys that didn't go all the way. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  I had a lot of pressure going all the way through college and then coming out of college with a lot of freaking bills.  Well, I got some of the mess out of the way in my early 20s.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, let's say from 17 to 21, I cleared up a lot of mess that I might not have if I had been in college.  I would have been furthering the mess, drinking and doing drugs.  Yeah.  What's Obama going to say?  Like, you know –  No, I understand that part.  Write song parodies.  Meet somebody – you know.  I understand that, that part of it.  But you know something? 
[00:06:00]  I believe more important than what you learn in school is the end result of the piece of paper that you get saying that you went to school.  I honestly believe – I did not learn a lot of what I know in high school.  I just didn't.  I'm with you.  I just learned shit.  I'm with you there, actually.  I learned my basics in elementary school where you learn how to, you know, write.  You learn your ABCs.  You learn your basic maths, you know, up to division, you know, shit like that. 
[00:06:30]  And then as you progress in life, that's where you learn things.  And that's where you figure what you want to know and how much of it you want to know.  Like, I was very interested in science.  My science class in school, I learned shit in there.  There's a fucking teacher that could give a flying fuck about being there.  Students that didn't want to be there.  And I loved the subject.  But, you know, I learned about science, reading it about the shit on my own, doing stuff like that, you know, fucking making my own dynamite. 
[00:07:00]  That's a pretty good point.  Most of the classes you take in, I don't know, high school especially, are a waste of time.  Who gives a shit about Russian history?  I had to take a class on Russian history, and next thing you know, there's no Russia anymore.  So this was a waste of time.  You learn all about the Soviet Union.  I think it's important right up until, eh, ninth grade.  Yeah, ninth grade.  Because they give you all the basics.  The basic math, reading and writing.  That's it.  A little science, a little history. 
[00:07:30]  And then depending on what you want to pursue, then you start delving into areas that you can get a further education.  But, again, more so just get that piece of paper to go to the next level.  Most of my schooling was just busy work.  Yeah.  They give you busy work.  It's leveling up.  You go home.  You're playing fucking EverQuest.  That's what high school is.  You go home.  World of Warcraft.  You go home with a stack of books and a ton of assignments that are just, it's just busy work. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  When you could be using that time maybe exploring, you know, and learning about all the shit.  That's it.  I had telescopes, microscopes, chemistry sets, all kinds of geek fucking shit at my house.  And I loved it.  It was great.  That's how I learned shit.  And reading, like, before the internet, encyclopedias.  We had encyclopedias in our house.  All right.  And I would just kind of go through that.  All right.  Hey, come on.  People remember encyclopedias.  These kids have the internet. 
[00:08:30]  They got the Google.  Matt in Rochester.  There's a little porno in an encyclopedia.  Matt, what do you got?  Oh, there was a little porno in there.  You had to look for it, though.  Tiny little pictures.  Vagina.  Can I say how big of an asshole is the last man to invest his finances in encyclopedia making?  Who's the last guy to put his money into encyclopedias?  There's got to be one last guy.  This computer thing is crap.  I'm telling you.  People like to hold a book.  Can you imagine how depressing that guy's day was? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, he's driving around trying to sell encyclopedias as he sees the computer trucks all over the neighborhood.  Yeah.  Setting up computers for everybody.  Dude, he stacked his encyclopedias up and he hung himself from the raft.  Just kicked him out.  Kicked a few out from the pile.  The bottom of his feet smelled like new books.  Did we lose you, Matt?  Where did we go?  Matt in Rochester, of course, the home of Brother Wheeze.  What's up, Matt?  Hi, Matt.  Hey, Ed.  Listen, first of all, I love you.  You're my hero because you're 60 years old and you fucked 14-year-old chicks. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you.  And you made me laugh.  That's 16.  Exaggerating.  For the past 15 years.  Thank you, sir.  But for your own health, you've got to get off this politics thing because it's all bullshit.  Nothing has changed since the election.  Nothing will change.  The country is not set up for change anymore.  The election, it was a show.  Yeah, I understand.  It's all bullshit.  But don't you realize?  I kind of like what Matt's saying there, though. 
[00:10:00]  I really do.  I think most of the stuff that Obama's preaching and yelling and screaming about will never be accomplished.  The only reason things don't change...  Why Obama's yelling and screaming?  It's the 24-hour cable news that'll take any speech and pick it apart and give you the little snippets that...  And then they'll tell you why you should be pissed off.  Well, here it is.  I know what his agenda is and I don't like it.  And the reason... 
[00:10:30]  How do you know what his agenda is?  How do I know what his agenda is?  I've listened to his speeches.  I've seen his past performance and past record on certain things, especially things that are important to me, like the Second Amendment and too much government in our lives and higher taxes.  This is shit that he is doing and trying to do.  And the only way to keep him from doing it, and like you said, nothing really changes, the reason nothing will change is because there are people that are against what he wants to do.  And it's the same way with the other way.  You know, the Republicans get in, they want to do things. 
[00:11:00]  The reason it doesn't happen is because the other side doesn't want it done.  So it keeps it in balance, but someone's got to speak up.  I mean, that's what do you think these town hall meetings with everybody screaming and yelling are all about?  The reason nothing changes is because the way the country is set up, it's not where a party takes over and has power anymore.  Nowadays, the country is center-right no matter what. 
[00:11:30]  It's the corporate agenda that will always win because money is power.  Well, money's run the country for many years, sir.  I mean, a lot of people don't want to – they think it's all about freedom, democracy.  No, it's cash.  It comes down to the money dollar.  Yeah.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  I understand what you're saying.  Thanks, Matt.  I think you should get into something else, man.  I don't know, gardening or flight. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  I could do that.  Will you be able to relax when Obama's out of office?  Depends on who's in.  When we get another white president for you.  Oh, a white president?  If we had a white president, you would be sleeping like a baby, right?  Sleep like a baby.  Look, I – yes, sir?  Turn off the TV for like two days and see if your life is a little better.  Just drink and just concentrate on pussy and just turn off –  Hold on, hold on.  You don't think I can fucking watch TV at the same time? 
[00:12:30]  Let me fill you in, sir.  Anthony fucks while typing his manifesto.  But Matt's making a good point.  Matt, I like what you're thinking, what you're saying there.  I mean, all news stations are driving everybody nuts.  Yeah.  You watch for over an hour.  I'm barely watching, though.  You watch that Situation Room, you really think there might be a situation at hand.  I don't watch the news a lot.  You don't watch the Situation Room?  I honestly don't watch the news a lot.  I watch a lot of shows, a lot of these kind of forensic files. 
[00:13:00]  I love shit like that.  I like First 48.  I like shows like that, real reality shows.  You're going to watch – people watch TV and listen to things that reinforce their own ideas.  And that's why people's ideas never really change.  And, you know, no matter what, even though I completely disagree with you on everything,  I would never be able to get you to change your views.  No, you're right.  It's just fun to listen to.  And vice versa, Matt. 
[00:13:30]  It's a big waste of energy to me.  It really is.  You know, during the election, I was on the Obama train.  I believed it.  I thought, yeah, there's going to be fucking change.  You know, we're going to get health care and whatever.  But, you know what, O.P. was right all along.  It's all bullshit.  Politicians are politicians.  They're not real people.  They have strings pulled by the people who are really in power, which we don't know. 
[00:14:00]  I like that.  You know what, hold on, man.  The Illuminati.  You make some good points, but you also got to realize things do change.  Sometimes – it's like health care is a massive change in this country.  It's like it's hard to get something that big changed.  And there's something going to change with it.  But things do change, man.  It's just not – you know, it's slow.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  Yeah, it's not this overnight revolutionary kind of –  Yeah, but things do change.  I mean, there is going to be a difference in the way you pay your taxes and the amount of money you spend, I think, with Obama than it would have been with – 
[00:14:30]  It will be so minimal, though, and they'll be broadcast as these big changes.  And that's why this whole health care thing is – it's a fight.  Every day in the paper, you know, we count all meaning.  It's a fight.  You know, I mean, journalism, they have – you know, we all know journalism is shit today.  And it's all about selling –  You don't think if that health care – you don't think if that health care bill went through that it would be a giant change in America? 
[00:15:00]  No, not at all.  How do we – what?  Well, let me give you an example.  My ex-girlfriend, her parents took her off health care because they couldn't afford it anymore.  So she had to go get, you know, her fucking toothpicks that cost $400.  I mean, it's not really that bad if, you know, kids and college kids like me, people who really need their teeth fixed could just get it done.  It's not really that big of a deal.  You don't think it would be a giant burden on the actual people and companies and corporations that kind of keep this country running? 
[00:15:30]  And you don't see it as a socialist program?  No?  No, and I think that word socialism, you've got to kind of take another look at how that's used.  I mean, socialism in its pure sense is really not bad.  It's just the theory that everyone has the same rights.  That is bad.  Not the same rights.  You don't have the same rights under socialism. 
[00:16:00]  You don't have the same rights.  You don't have any fucking rights.  You have the right to give the government in charge what they ask for so they could dole it out and keep the playing field level for everybody.  Which, if you ask me, is nothing about what this country was based on.  The whole basis of socialism is that instead of in this country where we have capitalism, where, you know, it's all about accumulating wealth.  And that's why we have such an income disparity in this country. 
[00:16:30]  The idea of socialism was to have everyone kind of on an equal level above, you know, where the, you know, the ideal living situation is.  Obviously, it didn't really work out.  No, it never does.  Or Russia or whatever.  Find one country where it works.  I'm not going to deny that.  I mean, capitalism is the best system we have.  But it does have its evils.  I want to think to you with this, Gary.  You've got to say what?  You say people don't change and it's like the country doesn't change. 
[00:17:00]  Like, 40 years ago, I mean, look at the way, black people couldn't vote in a lot of places.  And now we have a black president.  I mean, it's like America has been very good at doing things a certain way and then completely changing.  If you look at how far the country has come since its inception to where we are now, America is actually very good at adapting and, as they said, kind of course correcting mistakes in policy and mistakes in social policy.  But it's not going to happen overnight.  No, but it does happen in a relatively short period of time as far as a country. 
[00:17:30]  Look at the way the Soviet Union is 40 years ago and the way they are now.  I mean, they're different, but the citizens don't seem to enjoy a whole lot more rights than they did 40 years ago.  No.  All right.  We've got to think about it, Matt.  Matt, thank you.  Very good phone call.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to move on to...  I don't agree with Matt, but I would defend his right to...  Just shut the fuck up.  I love that one.  I know.  I'd shoot Matt for saying what he said.  Megan in D.C.  What do you got, Megan?  Megan's a high school biology teacher.  Oh!  Megan, what do you got?  Anthony, you just had a shitty teacher.  There's lots of good teachers. 
[00:18:00]  Just because you're dumbasses sitting there too high to learn anything doesn't mean there aren't kids that get stuff out of high school.  I wasn't too high to learn anything.  I was very busy.  You said you were out in the parking lot all through high school.  People listen too closely.  No, there you go.  Are you a cute teacher, Megan?  A cute teacher?  Yeah.  Are you like one of those pretty teachers?  Um, sure.  See, maybe I would have listened to you.  I had ugly teachers!  All right, Megan.  Thank you.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey. 
[00:18:30]  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, Anthony.  What's going on?  How you doing, man?  Are you really getting upset that Obama encouraged kids to stay in school?  Are you nuts?  No, no, no, no.  I'm getting...  It's just kind of a personal little insult to me.  I didn't say he shouldn't have said this.  I didn't say that he was wrong.  I'm just saying I felt he was leaving out a lot of people that didn't graduate high school  and are very successful.  If you ask me, uh, I don't... 
[00:19:00]  Am I right in saying that Bill Gates was a high school dropout?  I do believe Bill Gates was a high school dropout, and, uh, you gotta say, that guy's  a little successful.  True.  But you should relax and just sniff your fingers and enjoy your life.  Yeah.  Exactly, my friend.  Paul, what great advice from Paul.  Sniff my fingers and enjoy my life.  Let me...  Well, we don't have a lot of Bill Gateses out there, though, is the problem.  Bill Gateses?  Bill Gateses.  There's not a lot of Bill Gateses. 
[00:19:30]  Yes, but the way you do that is Bill Gateses, and you have to just put it, no answers.  No answers.  Bill Gateses.  There'll always be an exception, but, uh, I mean, you can't have Obama saying, yeah,  no, kids.  I understand that.  You'll be, uh, just fine if you drop out of school.  But he did kind of just leave out some people.  But I understand why he did, how he did.  I'm not, I'm not complaining about that part of it, by the way.  We're not even, yeah, we're, we haven't gotten to the part that's driving Anthony nuts.  Yeah, that's driving me crazy.  Tom.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey there, Tom.  What's up, Tom?  You're around, Tom.  Last caller.  Now, last caller kind of said my point, but... 
[00:20:00]  Oh, sure.  Here in Detroit, we have over 30% dropout rate.  Yes.  65% of the adult population can't read.  And a lot of those people who can't work steal.  And...  Right.  If he wants people to finish school, get an education, and go to college and better themselves,  I'm all for it.  Now, I didn't vote for the guy.  I don't agree with a lot of the stuff he, you know, he's trying to implement.  Um, but Anthony, I gotta, you know, disagree with you here. 
[00:20:30]  Normally, I, you know, I'm right there with you on, on terms of Obama, but...  But I'm not saying this is bad.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing that he said.  See, people are jumping the gun here, saying that I think what he said is bad.  I know he said this and had to say this.  And, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a good thing to say.  Stay in school.  How can I sit here, uh, on my high horse and argue that the president saying stay in school  is a bad thing?  Come on, I'm not that fucking crazy.  Okay.  All right, with that, we got Rape Kit in Harlem. 
[00:21:00]  Rape Kit.  Ah, Rape Kit.  Did you win the lottery?  Was that you in the paper, Rape Kit?  Did you win the $168 million in Harlem?  How much was it, $168 million?  Yeah, that motherfucker got some twofuses on him.  He's, um, rich.  If I did, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be calling right now telling you to get off your fucking  high horse.  Ah!  Rape Kit.  Listen, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Anthony, Anthony.  I got two things to tell you.  First of all, I understand we're in a capitalist country.  I understand that you achieved success and that you do not want to give away your success 
[00:21:30]  in financial terms to people who you think don't deserve it.  Anthony, I know we're not in a socialist nation, but we have social programs in this country  that have been existing longer than you've been alive, longer than anyone who's been alive.  I know there's social programs, a lot of which I don't like, but there's a difference  between having some social programs and having a socialist government. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, but Anthony, you're overreacting.  Ah, overreacting.  Yeah.  Let me tell you about all the people that overreacted.  All the people that are sitting in that room, Opie, you're too influential, and you listen  to Anthony for five minutes, and you start to agree with him no matter what he says.  That's not true.  No, I don't really, that's not true at all, actually, but.  Well, it sounds like it sometimes, but.  I don't really feel like arguing the whole Obama thing.  My whole take on the thing is that the system in general is broke, and it doesn't matter who's 
[00:22:30]  in there.  It's plumbusty.  We got some real problems with how this country is run.  Look at the deficit we got right now.  You look at what, if, if, if, you know, you had a doctor in a while ago who was talking  about this health care plan before the town hall started.  Yep.  And, you know, he was saying that the main plan of what the people who want to get this  through is to expand a basic system of Medicare for all.  And, you know, as a country, are we not, you know, partially, if there's not an obligation 
[00:23:00]  to give, you know, to be able to say that we are as strong as our weakest link.  You say what country can operate under socialist terms.  Yeah.  Well, obviously, no country is as successfully as a total socialist nation.  Right.  But look at the countries that beat us in health care.  We're 37th on the list, Anthony.  Look at the other countries who beat us on that list and how happy their people are and  don't nearly pay as much money into the health care system as we do. 
[00:23:30]  Now, so the important thing here is you were going to compliment me, I believe, in some  way.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm saying, I think, Jimmy, you're the most rational person in there.  Okay, now you're talking like a crazy person.  No, I'm not.  Because out of all the people who look at politics as an issue, Anthony, you're too concerned  about Obama taking away your guns.  He's not coming anywhere close to doing that.  I tried telling him that.  Of course he's not.  He's not doing any other important shit to worry about.  You don't watch or you don't look at his previous record and he's still got a few years 
[00:24:00]  left.  I don't have a previous record as much as you do.  Exactly.  He's still got a little time left.  That's not his priority.  And he's still got a little time left in the White House to go after certain things.  That's why I defend my rights.  That's why I speak out and defend my rights, my constitutional rights.  You don't think...  You have 100% of your time.  You spend 100% of your time defending your NRA rights.  And you're defending something that Obama, it's not even on his main course plate. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, it's not.  I'm not saying that if he's there for eight years that he's not going to touch the NRA  situation of, you know, gun control.  But Anthony, you got nothing to worry about right now.  He's got way more important fish to fry than your fucking gun.  Thank goodness he's got opposition and he's got other things on his mind.  Because his record on gun control is abominable.  Yeah.  Abominable.  It's way too, it's way too, it's way too, uh, it's way too, uh, authoritative when it 
[00:25:00]  comes to taking away your basic rights to have a gun in your home, which I don't think,  you know, is out of the question of, you know, it's not out of the question of a reasonability.  But Anthony, you're worried about all these things, you know, Obama talking about it.  I don't, I know you haven't gotten to the rest of the education speech, but you have to  understand that as a politician, especially if you want to become president, it's a pretty  selfless act.  And I think Obama cares a lot about the nation's weak. 
[00:25:30]  And I know you could care less about that.  No, no, no.  I live in an area where there's a lot of people that would be considered weak.  Right.  Okay.  And a lot of them are fucking taking advantage of the government, you know, and not providing  for the government themselves, not putting, you know, their best interest into making this  a better nation, but you know what, Anthony, you got to think about people that are trying  that just haven't had the luck that you had.  Do you know, do you understand that I have sitting on my table at home right now, a giant 
[00:26:00]  check that I am mailing out to the United States government that I mail out every three  fucking months.  Do you understand?  I'm doing my part yet.  I'm villainized by motherfuckers like you that think I don't do shit.  I'm not villainizing you.  Fuck off.  You are too.  You're saying I don't give a shit.  I don't give a shit about the poor and the needy. 
[00:26:30]  And we have to help this.  What do you think I'm doing?  I'm signing checks, motherfucker.  But that doesn't mean you give a shit, though.  I don't give a shit.  You're being forced to give a lot of money to the United States government.  It's not like you're like, you know what?  I don't give a shit about the poor.  Thank you.  Here you go, poor.  I'm giving you another check.  I'm doing my part.  You don't want to be doing your part.  I don't want the hand in my other fucking pocket.  The government put that hand in that other pocket a long time ago, though. 
[00:27:00]  Then I don't want a third one in my front pocket.  A long time ago.  I want my own hand there.  Fiddling with my balls.  Capitalists are treated like kings.  Not in this country, Anthony.  All right, Rape Kid.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to get to the clip that really bothered Anthony.  Here it is.  You'll need the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies  to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more  fair and more free. 
[00:27:30]  You'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies.  They'll create new jobs and boost our economy.  We need every single one of you to develop your talents and your skills and your intellect  so you can help us old folks solve our most difficult problems.  If you don't do that, if you quit on school, you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting  on your country.  All right.  That's the part I fucking love. 
[00:28:00]  You quit on school.  You're quitting on your country.  Again, to have to sit there and write huge checks for the government and be told that,  you know, I quit on my country.  What?  Don't try to villainize me.  I'm always being villainized.  I'm not a villain.  He's trying to just give people.  He's just trying to motivate people who are young.  He's trying to give him a little hope. 
[00:28:30]  I could see if he actually was saying, I think if more people stayed in school, I think  the country would be better off.  You're right.  He's trying to make them feel part of something bigger and important.  All right.  You changed my mind.  But you're an exception to what's going on out there, Anthony.  By the way, Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard, not high school.  Oh, right.  Excuse me.  Well, he didn't stay in school.  Oh, my God.  You're right.  What am I talking about?  I know.  Maybe you don't have adults in your life who give you the support that you need. 
[00:29:00]  Maybe someone in your family has lost their job and there's not enough money to go around.  Maybe you live in a neighborhood where you don't feel safe or have friends who are pressuring  you to do things you know aren't right.  Drugs.  But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life, what you look like, where you  come from, how much money you have, what you've got going on at home, none of that is  an excuse for neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude in school.  That's no excuse for talking back to your teacher or cutting class or dropping out of 
[00:29:30]  school.  There is no excuse for not trying.  Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up.  No one's written your destiny for you.  Because here in America, you write your own destiny.  You make your own future.  Now, I know it's got a pain in you, but you've got to agree with what Obama's saying.  That's some of the same stuff you have said.  Yeah.  No excuses.  Pick yourself up by your bootstraps, I say.  Pick yourself up by your bootstraps. 
[00:30:00]  You have to agree with what Obama was just saying there.  I was absolutely agreeing.  I just don't like when anybody comes out and tells me I'm not doing my part.  That's what I don't like.  I just don't like that.  His speech wasn't that bad.  They just want to hear out there that you like doing your part.  What?  Out there in Radio Land.  Why would I like doing my part?  They want to hear that.  You know what?  When my part...  I do very well, and I'm doing my part, and I don't mind.  You know what it is?  I think that's what some of those people out there want to hear. 
[00:30:30]  It's being told, yes, you're doing your part, but you're just not doing enough anymore.  Now, with me in office, you have to do more of your part.  And you know what?  I'm doing plenty.  Well, that's where I agree with you.  That's what it is.  I'm doing fucking plenty.  You want more money?  Find it somewhere else.  Take the raise that fucking Congress got and take that away from them.  That's where I agree with you.  Don't let them write their own fucking raises.  Keep going.  I agree with you.  Yes.  Find money somewhere else. 
[00:31:00]  I agree with you.  Take the bureaucratic bullshit, the 18 levels of redundant employees in the government,  and throw them the fuck out.  I agree with you again.  Do something brave.  Now we're talking.  Do something brave and different.  Now we're talking.  Not just overtax the overtaxed, you prick.  That's what I'm saying.  Who are you calling a prick?  Anybody who's overtaxing me.  Oh, all right.  Good.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Mike in Jersey?  Maybe.  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[00:31:30]  Nice work, Lou.  I just want to make a comment.  The guy about what he said about socialism before is that, you know, capitalism is evil.  Capitalism is all about acquiring wealth.  That's not the truth.  Capitalism is about individual freedom.  Yes.  You know, I've got to agree with you, Ann.  Thank you.  You know, overtaxed and overtaxed.  If you look at it, you know, before 1913, before they passed the income tax, you know,  the United States was one of the richest countries in the world, and they didn't have any kind of income tax. 
[00:32:00]  It was taxed based on, you know, what the population was in each district.  Yeah, like what you had.  You know, if you're going to go back to socialism and, you know, go back to what Karl Marx said, Karl Marx said, abandon all private property.  That means whatever I have, you have.  What you have, I have.  Yeah, you don't own anything really, truly.  It belongs to the collective.  It's the fucking Borg.  I don't want to be assimilated.  You know, and what they do with this, with the tax code, you know, 1913, it was the reason why they passed it was, oh, the rich have more money than the poor. 
[00:32:30]  The rich are the reason why we're all poor.  Yeah.  They passed the income tax.  And that was supposed to be the top 1%.  It was like 400 pages, the top 1% of the wealthy.  And they said, okay, we can get some money.  After, what, 90 years?  That trickled down so much that now everybody is taxed.  Well, it's not the top 1% anymore.  Everybody is getting taxed in what bracket. 
[00:33:00]  They use it as a tool, you know, and, you know, the.  They use it as a fucking ATM machine.  I don't want to be the government's fucking ATM machine anymore.  Come on.  I am interested to see Michael Moore's documentary on capitalism.  I am.  I saw the trailer for that piece of shit, and it's like, enough with this fat fuck walking around with his gags.  Oh, look, I got a big money bag.  I'm out on the side of AIG.  I want my money back.  Oh, shut it, you fucking pig. 
[00:33:30]  You're not a fan of Michael Moore.  He annoyed me for so many years.  Sicko, I did like, though.  Certain points he made were undeniable in Sicko.  What a slob.  I'm interested to see him doing it.  I don't mind the Michael Moore.  No, I like him more than I used to, because I hated him.  Hated him.  And then I started sicko.  It's a bit hokey at times.  Yeah, but that visualization that he does, it really is good at fucking, at those, like,  taking bullets to Walmart.  Looking to buy, but he took, like, guys that got shot.  The guys that got shot and went to Walmart to buy bullets. 
[00:34:00]  He's really good at certain.  He's a shock jock.  He's a shock jock on the fucking, on the movie screen.  You gotta respect Michael Moore.  He's good with the bullhorn.  He's good with the bullshit, too, because he don't believe in half of that crap.  We sat down and talked to that motherfucker, and he certainly came off as somebody who  goes, hey, I got a gimmick going here.  Nah, Michael Moore was a fan of ours.  I know.  He was a big fan of ours when we met him.  He likes taking that bullhorn and talking to buildings that don't talk back.  Hey, everybody.  I love that. 
[00:34:30]  Hey, A.I.G., I'm out here.  Capitalism is bad.  Why can't we get health care?  Whoa, I'm Michael Moore.  Hold on, I'll be right back.  I gotta eat.  And then the building just stares at him.  Yeah, and the building looks at him.  Just kind of looks at him.  Because it's a building.  It's a building.  It doesn't talk back.  And no one wants to talk to him because he's Michael Moore.  You're right.  Twist your words around.  You kind of see him coming, right?  Fuck him.  Nothing wrong with being a dropout.  Tracy in Pittsburgh understands what Anthony is saying.  Let's go to Tracy.  Tracy. 
[00:35:00]  Morning.  How's Pittsburgh doing?  Hi, Tracy.  It's raining and it's nasty.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's ugly.  Obama's fault.  He has a weather machine.  You're right.  Shit.  What's up?  Obama's supposed to be here.  So, yeah, you're right.  Biden brought the rain.  I agree with you, Anthony.  I know exactly what you're saying.  His speech.  Yeah, he was right.  Motivating.  But he's a jerk.  I understand his motivation.  Like, I understand what.  Obviously, I'm not that stupid.  I know that he's going to high school and going to schools and speaking to students and saying stay in school. 
[00:35:30]  That's fine.  I got no problem with that.  Also, insulting kids that aren't going to stay in school.  Like, hey, you're stupid.  I'm not.  Not everybody's stupid who quit school.  Some people just aren't challenged in school.  Yeah, well, it wasn't his, you know, time to say that there are people that never graduated school that are contributing a lot to this society.  Tracy just said something that's pretty good because Anthony is one of those guys that wasn't challenged in school.  And you come across people like Anthony in your life where school just isn't for them. 
[00:36:00]  It wasn't my bag.  I went to school and realized it wasn't for me.  It was a waste of time.  You know, because I did graduate college.  My college was a waste of time.  Yeah.  I learned it was a waste of time.  I ended up quitting.  I was so bored.  All they wanted to do is charge you tons of money and give you a piece of paper that seems what?  Nothing.  I went for a communications degree.  In most cases, going for a communications degree is a waste of time. 
[00:36:30]  I went to Geneseo, though, and I was lucky to be on the radio station as a freshman, which leads to where I am today.  But if it wasn't for that, Geneseo would have been a waste of time for me.  I knew that.  I completely knew that at the time.  And I felt bad for a lot of the guys that, you know, were alongside me getting their communication degrees at Geneseo.  They never went anywhere with their communication degrees.  You know?  But you like to know, there's a small percentage of people who actually go to school and actually are in their field. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, true.  What they went to school for and if they're actually working in that field.  And if Obama really believes in this education thing, and I do believe he does, he should try to bring down college costs.  That's another thing.  It is insane what kids are paying to go to college now.  Putting themselves in debt or putting the parents in debt.  It's ridiculous.  Hey, I worked three and four jobs to put myself through school.  I mean, I worked very hard. 
[00:37:30]  And as far as, like, I came from, you know, middle class.  I still had to work.  I had to get the loans.  I paid my loans off for 15 years after school.  15 years.  15 years.  Right.  15 years.  That's what you get for getting an education.  This is what I need to know.  I mean, I graduated a long time ago.  And my college bill at the time was expensive.  I was paying that off for, I don't think I did 15 years.  I think I did about seven.  But I want to know this.  How much does it cost to go to a SUNY school here in New York for four years? 
[00:38:00]  How much is it going to cost you when you get out?  How much is your college bill going to be?  And then I want to know how much is the average university bill?  So someone out there starts, you know, calling up with the figures.  Doing your math.  Because, you know, you graduate from college and you're way in the hole to begin with.  Before you even walk into your first day at work.  That's insane.  Cream Pie Jones, by the way.  If you remember our old intern, Cream Pie Jones.  Owes $120,000 to Syracuse. 
[00:38:30]  To Syracuse.  And he pulled duty out of a toilet bowl.  So he owes me money, too.  He pulled duty out of a toilet.  He put a hat on it and waved at it.  He put a hat on shit.  Syracuse is one of the premier communication.  They have one of the premier communication programs.  Okay.  Problem is you get a communications degree at Syracuse.  You're $120,000 in the hole.  You're not going to make anywhere as near that in radio for many, many, many years. 
[00:39:00]  If ever.  Yeah, that's a gamble.  Is that an investment or a gamble?  No.  There's a lot of people gambling.  Yeah.  And going into major debt because they're trying to get that college education.  Yeah.  That's where, well, that's one of the problems we can fix in this country.  But who wants to tackle that one?  Who wants to take that one on?  You know, Obama's telling all these kids to stay in school.  And then they go to college and now they're in debt.  Uh-huh.  The type of debt that scares you.  You wake up in the morning going, how the fuck am I going to pay off my college loans? 
[00:39:30]  I remember those days.  I finally, you know, hit it big and I was able to pay it off.  But year after year after year, I was like writing these checks that I didn't have.  You know, doing the minimum.  Having the people calling me and harassing me as I'm trying to do the right thing and work and try to pay off my college loans.  Was your mouth writing checks your body couldn't cash?  Fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah.  I love any movie with that line in it.  Here we go.  Your mouth is writing checks your body can't cash.  Let's go to Mike on Long Island. 
[00:40:00]  Mike.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hi, Mike.  Hi, sir.  Mike.  I did four years at SUNY Corlin.  Yep.  And I came out, I was pretty lucky.  I only came out with about $20,000 in loans.  Yeah.  You're $20,000 in the hole before your first day of work.  Yep.  And I'm a teacher, so now I have to go get my master's at Adelphi, which is crazy expensive.  Now, when did you graduate?  I graduated in 2007.  All right.  How many years do you think it's going to take you to pay off your $20,000 loan? 
[00:40:30]  At least 10.  At least 10.  So for 10 years, you're in the hole.  Wow.  Is it that long to pay off $20,000?  Yes.  Amazing.  Yes.  It's ridiculous, Jimmy.  How bad is the interest on it?  About $6,000 and change.  Yeah, I think they try to keep the interest down, but still.  I don't know if that's a lot, because I didn't go to college, obviously.  Well, I consolidated, which helped me out a little bit, but.  I'm still paying off my community college loan.  I did one semester in 19, I think it was 1989, high school and college credits, and I still 
[00:41:00]  owe money.  Really?  Real sex community college.  I think I owe $37.  $37.  All right.  Let's go to Tim in Iowa.  Tim.  Hi, Tim.  How are you doing, man?  Welcome aboard, Tim.  Yeah, hey, I'm with you, and I'm really tired of giving up all my shit for those people who  really don't want to fucking do anything.  I mean, I have worked my ass off all my life.  I'm like you.  I didn't graduate high school, but man, I leave home at like 7 o'clock at night, and I  get home 7, 8 o'clock in the morning. 
[00:41:30]  I've worked my ass off, and then just to have these guys take it away, then I see these guys  just sitting around that dude's shit, and just, I'm like, he just pisses you off.  Yeah.  That is the frustrating part.  I'm sorry.  I'm talking with eggs.  Nobody minds helping people who are, I think, down in their luck.  Yeah.  But you start to resent it when you're busting your ass, and you see people who are doing  almost nothing getting handouts.  It's not about helping, like, nobody minds helping somebody who's poor and is having 
[00:42:00]  a shitty time.  You want to help people.  And the way these programs are run, it's just open, it's wide open for abuse.  It's wide open for people to abuse the system, because no one wants to change the system.  They want to tax the fuck out of people, and then shovel the money over one way, and then  dole it out the other end.  And they don't change the system, so maybe it's not so flawed.  Maybe there aren't five or ten people that could do one person's job soaking up the money. 
[00:42:30]  So many people that can work that aren't working.  And I don't think people mind things like welfare or, obviously, unemployment, helping  people out who are having a shitty time.  People get laid off, man.  A woman gets pregnant, and the guy leaves.  There's nothing you can do.  But it's when it happens over and over.  It's people who are continually having kids and welfare.  You're like, what the fuck is all that?  Brian in Syracuse, by the way, the cream pie number is a little low. 
[00:43:00]  So Syracuse is now up to, according to his stats, $46,000 per year.  We're talking about $185,000 for four years.  Now, yeah.  Well, cream pie paid off some debt.  He paid off some debt.  I don't think that's what he owes now.  But he just got fired from his warehouse job.  Yeah.  And that was after working at Spencer Gift.  Yeah.  So this is what cream pie Jones is doing with his college education.  And you know what?  That's happening a lot.  Cream pie is not the exception.  That is happening to a lot of college kids.  They're way in debt. 
[00:43:30]  And they can't get the type of job to come close to paying off the bills anytime soon.  Where are you going to get that?  In a way.  That's why it's not a gamble.  Or it's not an investment.  I was going to say, in a way, it's a gamble.  Not much of a gamble to maybe not even go to college.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's what I was trying to say.  You know what?  If you don't go to college, you could guarantee that you've got $100,000 extra dollars laying around.  Yeah.  Figure out dollars and cents wise.  You're going to make less money.  But you're not going to owe a shitload of money to pay back your college loan.  I think what you said is absolutely true. 
[00:44:00]  A way to bring down the cost of educating people that actually want to go to school and will do something with it.  I said that.  And how you deal with that.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Somewhere in this whole fucking melange.  I mean, what they're doing with the colleges, it's just insane.  Yeah.  There's no reason it should be that much.  Why is it costing that much money and putting a lot of, you know, young, I mean, there's still young kids in major debt.  22 years old and, you know, a lot of us didn't have mommy and daddy paying for college. 
[00:44:30]  Next thing you know, you get that freaking bill in the mail every month going, how am I going to pay this?  But to lower that, doesn't that kind of go hand in hand with pseudo-socialism?  Like if you're telling them.  It does.  There's no way how you do that.  Unless there's some other way.  But you know what, Jimmy?  That's what I'm saying, come up, instead of just tax and spend and tax this and do that, come up with some other fucking way to do business.  You're right, Jimmy, but they're getting away with murder. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, the college costs are just, there's parents out there that they're like, I don't know how I'm going to pay for my-  The colleges are huge businesses.  They're making giant amounts of money.  Colleges are a business.  No, I agree.  I actually think they should do something.  But I'm saying it's like whenever the government steps in and says, look, you can't just keep fucking people.  People are going to say, that's kind of socialist.  Anytime the government steps in.  Let's say hi to Daryl.  Daryl.  Hi, Daryl.  How are you doing?  I'm one of these people that actually went back to school to think I'd get a job. 
[00:45:30]  See, I went to Westchester, Pennsylvania, and four years there, and I couldn't find a job in education.  And they're like, oh, let's go back to school for a master's degree.  Two years, we'll pay for it.  And after you get done, you'll get a job guaranteed.  Brand new field in higher education.  It's all yours.  Five months later, I'm still looking for a job.  I'm actually driving the Lowe's right now, you know, working a job I could have done without going to school.  Right.  Yeah.  You wouldn't have owed money. 
[00:46:00]  And, yeah.  How much do you owe?  $84,000.  Holy shit.  And the number 80.  Go ahead, Daryl.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  But I don't owe that until February because you get like six, seven months to get money to start paying for it.  But it's going to be like $400 a month for like 20 years.  $400 a month for 20 years.  That is a big bill for a lot of people, most people.  You're pumped out in debt.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  You start in debt.  And, Anthony, the number coming in, the average is what Daryl's saying, about 80 Gs. 
[00:46:30]  About 80 grand.  That's the average.  It's going a lot higher than that and a little lower than that.  But it's safe to say most of these college kids are in debt for about 80 Gs when they get out.  80 Gs.  I pay $5.50 a month in college.  $5.50 a month, Travis?  And how many years have you been paying that?  Three years I graduated.  That's how much you pay every month?  Yeah.  Every month.  $550.  And that's consolidated as low as it will go.  How much do you owe total?  Now, about $50,000.  And you owe it, not your parents, right?  Your parents?  Yeah, I owe it. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  How does that make sense?  On top of your rent and the baby and your wife?  On top of everything.  Do you realize if I had that $500, like, everything would be so much better.  You could buy it, yeah.  You know?  But again, what are you going to do?  Go press another button.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes, because your job here is on very thin ice.  This might be a bad time to tell you.  Ah, look at this young strapping gentleman.  A lot of people saying $80,000 is the number.  Here's the last bit of audio as Obama talked to the kids. 
[00:47:30]  So today I want to ask all of you, what's your contribution going to be?  What problems are you going to solve?  What discoveries will you make?  What will a president who comes here in 20 or 50 or 100 years say about what all of you did for this country?  Remember that goof we did 20 years ago?  Your families or teachers and I are doing everything we can to make sure you have the education you need to answer these questions. 
[00:48:00]  I'm working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn.  You are?  But you've got to do your part, too.  So I expect all of you to get serious this year.  Oh, that's good.  I expect you to put your best out of me.  Thanks.  That is fucking...  All right, now I'm behind Obama.  He wants all the students to get serious.  That's cool.  All right.  I'm behind it.  That's not what he means.  What?  S-E-R-I-U-S.  Stop it. 
[00:48:30]  S-I-R-I-U-S.  We're just a bunch of dicks.  Just fucking isolate that and play it.  Obama loves this platform.  That's very funny.  I want everybody to get serious this year.  That's funny.  Can we get that done?  We'll start running it on our channel.  Yes.  So I expect all of you to get serious this year.  Thank you.  I expect you to put your best effort into everything you do.  I expect great things from each of you. 
[00:49:00]  So don't let us down.  Us.  Don't let your family down or your country down.  Most of all, don't let yourself down.  Ah.  Make us all proud.  Okay.  Thank you very much, everybody.  You're welcome, Obama.  God bless America.  God bless you.  God bless America.  You're in a tight spot.  You got to agree with Obama for once, Ant.  Well, that's an easy one.  That's a nice speech.  I got it.  That's a nice speech.  That's a nice speech.  That can only help the country in the end.  I got no problem with that speech.  More kids stay in school and focus.  I mean, it doesn't hurt.  That's a fucking, it's one of these easy just go to fucking school and say stay in school 
[00:49:30]  speeches.  I agree with him.  You know what?  I agree with him on that.  What am I going to say?  How big an asshole can I be to say, wow, Obama, what a douchebag going to school and  saying stay in school?  I get frustrated by Obama because I think he could be a better speaker.  Really?  At that one convention when he brought down the House, you're like, wow, this guy, this  guy, this fucking guy can talk.  But when he's sitting down with a small group of children or whatnot, he's not that good. 
[00:50:00]  He's not that good.  I don't know.  I mean, Clinton would have.  He kind of trails off.  Right.  There's a thing he does.  Instead of just bringing your voice down and talk to the kids.  Yeah.  Imagine Clinton in that situation.  He knew how to, well, he'd be flirting with them.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Bill, we have you lined up to speak to fourth graders.  Could you make it like 12th grade?  That's right.  Yeah, okay.  Keep it legal.  Fat beret wearing piggy fuck.  Oh, boy.  Chappelle had the funniest joke about how at least JFK and it was fucking Marilyn Monroe. 
[00:50:30]  So, and then he said, and Clinton just, and then he just mimed looking at an office door  and then waving.  You, come here.  How he fucked picked Monica.  Yeah, you, come here.  Just the first pitch he saw in the hallway.  Stuck my dick.  I just want to clear everything up by saying my whole thing here wasn't the concept that  he made a speech and it sucked because he told kids to stay in school.  My whole thing was the contributions made by people like myself. 
[00:51:00]  I make a giant contributions to this country.  Giant.  Yeah.  And, you know, unfortunately, and I do look back with some regret that I didn't stay in  school and maybe go in other directions.  I don't know.  But, um, to say that I'm not contributing to society and that it's impossible to contribute  to society, uh, under different circumstances, uh, you know, that's a little silly.  But again, what is he going to say?  He couldn't say that.  I understand that.  Eventually the government, the government's not going to have any more excuses. 
[00:51:30]  Eventually they're going to run out of what they could tax.  And then what?  Then what happens?  We thought that happened years ago.  No kidding.  They, dude, they're fucking taking more than half your money.  Well, you know that, uh, Bloomberg wanted to tax soda here in New York.  Yeah.  And Obama, by the way, thinks it's something to look into.  Yeah.  I understand that.  Well, what I was going to say before that, but yeah, Bloomberg, uh, you know, it, it failed  miserably that people are like, get the fuck out of here.  But then Obama perked up and said, well, wait a minute. 
[00:52:00]  I don't mind that idea.  Yeah.  He, uh, he also put a, I was talking about yesterday, put a bunch of restrictions on cigarettes  and how they can present them and clove cigarettes, flavored cigarettes and things  like that.  But then he wouldn't answer the question.  Uh, Hey, are you still puffing occasionally?  He's having a cigarette.  He goes in the white house and where do you think he's smoking?  A little bit.  He can't smoke in public anymore.  No, he can't.  In the bathroom with a towel down or something.  Yeah.  Puts a towel down.  There's an old school dorm action.  It's like blowing it into a vent.  I'm the fucking president. 
[00:52:30]  He's got to be sitting there going, I'm the fucking president.  I was sneaking a cigarette.  I bet he sits once in a while.  He'll be in a hotel and he's just on the toilet.  Yeah.  And he's just got a cigarette and he's just shitting and flicking it into the hotel sink.  Ah, yeah.  And he's the president.  You think the president does that?  Why do I have to sneak around?  Of course he does.  The water's on.  How great is that?  He's got to spray cologne.  His wife's not with him so he can get away with it.  And who buys the cigarettes for Obama?  I'm sure one of the guys.  Secret Service.  He probably does.  I doubt he runs down and grabs a pack of Newports.  Give me a pack of cool.  Yeah.  You had to say Newports. 
[00:53:00]  Or cool.  Yeah.  Or cool.  It's got to be menthol.  What's his brand?  I honestly don't know.  Cool.  No, it's not.  Yes.  It'd have to be.  He smoked more 100.  Virginia Slims.  Virginia.  Vagina Slims.  He smokes Cool Miles.  Is that it?  Is that real?  I don't know.  All right.  I have no idea.  Imagine how much trouble Cool would get in if they had a picture of him with a cigarette  and they said the official cigarette of the president.  Oh, shit.  How much trouble they'd get into.  And they'd just show a picture of him smoking. 
[00:53:30]  Just put up big billboards near schools.  Yeah, absolutely.  Him smoking, talking to like a cartoon cat.  Oh, Obama apparently smokes Marlboro.  There you go.  Let's go to JoJo.  JoJo.  It almost sounds like instead of fighting the health care thing,  they should, you know, they're bitching that we're paying like $12 a Tylenol in the hospital  and we're overpaying for health care.  But you look at the colleges and we're doing worse there.  I mean, there's no way it costs, you know, $40,000 or $50,000 to go to a place for six 
[00:54:00]  or eight months.  So if we battle, fuck health care.  You get your health care on your own.  Let's fight the colleges for ripping everybody off.  And chances are if you go to college, if they'd lower those prices and more people  could go, we'd all get jobs where we got our health care.  Yeah, I hear you.  Oh, God damn it.  It looks like Ricky Ricardo in that one.  Is that him?  We're looking at Obama pictures.  That's the president of the United States of America.  He's smoking a butt.  He's got the old Ricky Ricardo straw hat on.  He looks like Pryor in that one. 
[00:54:30]  Look at his face.  He looks like Richard Pryor.  He's got a little Pryor going on.  The eyes, man.  Thank you, JoJo.  Let's go to Jeremy in South Dakota.  Jeremy.  Yeah.  What's up?  How are you guys?  Hey.  Good.  Hey, I wanted to talk about the health care thing.  You know, they're toting this, you know, help the poor and the downtrodden.  But we're already helping all them baby factories with Medicaid and all that.  What about these?  I drive trucks.  And I don't know how much time you spend in a truck stop.  But what about these 457-pound fat trucks that eat a buffet three times a day and drink 
[00:55:00]  gallons of sweet tea?  Why do we have to pay for their gardening?  I completely agree, dude.  Yeah, you're right.  Completely right.  There's plenty of fat trash out there that you see that they're downtrodden.  They can't afford it.  Yet they're big, fat slobs.  How does that work?  Morgan Spurlock made that point in Supersizing, which was great.  When people were, like, eating at the table, he goes, why?  If somebody smoked at the table or whatever, you'd say, how do you do that to yourself?  But nobody says that to people who are eating. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I was in the airport one time in LAX.  Oh, you weren't.  And there was a woman who was, I swear to God, I was.  Oh, sorry.  All right.  Imagine if I just broke down and confessed I was lying.  It was a train station in D.C. and I wanted to sound fancy.  And there was a woman who was, she was probably about 375 pounds.  She's a big, fat lady.  And she was buying a Snickers bar.  And she was, you could see she was embarrassed to buy it.  And I understand the shame of addiction and all that.  But it's like, you're in an airport.  You're obviously flying to or from somebody.  Someone looked and went, oh, fuck.  She's sitting next to me. 
[00:56:00]  And there you are buying a Snickers bar.  Don't fucking tell me that you're not contributing to that.  But yet my insurance goes up.  I have to pay more money.  It's like, yeah.  Like we have a story like that about a guy who is not.  I love Southwest.  Oh, boy.  If you're a big fat, so don't fly that airline.  They will.  They will boot you off.  And all the employees point and yell, bye bye, piggy piggy.  Leave this aircraft.  Oh, they are rough at Southwest.  They're getting bad.  Dude.  I know you got to pay for two seats and all that, right?  But there's one guy. 
[00:56:30]  They let him fly to Vegas with his wife.  This was a mistake by them.  And then coming back, the people in Vegas wouldn't let him on the plane.  Oh, shit.  One way trip, fatto.  They said that it was a mistake to let him fly there at all because he was so fat.  He didn't want to pay for two seats.  Pay for two seats.  Wow.  Damn.  All right.  Thank you, Jeremy.  We got the story somewhere.  Sorry.  Yeah, we'll get into that and other things.  We should take our first break.  All righty.  We got a swish-a-licious home run call from John Sterling after the break.  Sterling made another great call. 
[00:57:00]  It's amazing.  We'll get into that.  Yeah.  And you know what?  We asked the rest of America, you know, for your sports announcer.  And so far, no one comes close to John Sterling.  People are sending audio in, but no one comes close to this John Sterling guy.  The douche-ness.  Of his home run calls.  Yeah.  If you got one, though, you know, send it in.  Please.  We looked at the Pittsburgh Penguins guy.  He was pretty good.  Yeah.  He wasn't bad.  He wasn't bad.  But Sterling still takes the cake.  And his whole, oh, he goes, oh, before his douche-y line. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  This景 song here.  Sure, it's delicious.  Burr.  What a fucking asshole.  It's like, it's so good until you listen to, I haven't even heard this call.  Listen to how good the call is when we play it.  It's a walk-off home run.  It's a great call.  I guarantee it's a great one.  Into the upper, whatever.  And then he'll just say.  Fucking boob.  Ted Kennedy's alive.  Oh, wow.  Look at it.  He lives on TV.  Shit, he's alive.  On Senator Ted Kennedy's successor. 
[00:58:00]  Who's taking his seat?  It ain't old Joe.  Curt Schilling?  Yeah.  Shut up.  Curt Schilling is such a fucking steadfast Republican, he'd never get in there.  Just stop it.  From Massachusetts?  With his bloody fucking sock.  You're relaxed.  You threw a ball over a plate, good.  What the fuck qualifies you to do anything other than that?  You know, in Congress, unless they need shit thrown over the desk, they don't.  He'd be good at that.  Well, it shows how fucked up they are down there.  You die or something, and then your wife gets your job?  How does that make sense? 
[00:58:30]  That's silly.  How does that make sense?  It doesn't make sense.  You wouldn't do that, like, in a factory job.  Hell fucking no.  Your boss would be like, what, your wife, you know, the guy passed away, but now the guy's  wife is coming in to do the job?  Yeah, we got a lot of truckers.  You die, and they say, all right, well, the wife now drives.  Yeah, the wife will drive.  The wife will fucking run the grommet machine or the fucking lathe.  So fucked up down in Washington.  But I was like, all right, well, she lived with the guy.  She fucked the guy that had the job, so obviously she could do the job.  How many wives have gotten the husband's job after he passed? 
[00:59:00]  Sonny Bono.  That's the biggie.  But I think there's a few others.  And then what about, what's his name?  That other Kennedy there that flew into a tree skiing.  Bobby?  Was he married?  Did he have any office?  No, was it a Bobby Jr. or something like that?  Mike?  Mike Kennedy.  Mike?  Because I remember the old bit.  Yeah, I don't know.  Some hacky bit.  But it's happened quite a few times.  We should play our hacky bit when Mike Kennedy hit a tree.  Was it bad?  I never heard it.  If E-Rock could find it.  E-Rock, I want to hear it. 
[00:59:30]  Ant, do you remember it?  Unfortunately, yes, I do.  Is it a good bit?  No.  No, it's not good?  No.  No, that's not fair.  For the time, it was good.  For the time, it was all right.  All right.  I don't think I was with you guys, but I don't remember that.  No, you weren't.  Look, we all had bad haircuts.  That's what it comes down to.  All right.  But at the time, you thought it was a good haircut.  It's the same thing with radio.  Was this audio mullet?  People rocked a mullet, and it was perfectly acceptable back in the 80s.  We were rocking with those mullets. 
[01:00:00]  Look now, you look silly.  Of course.  But at the time, it rocked.  Fucking business up front party in the back, my friend.  Was that what it was called?  Of course.  Business up front party in the back.  You've never heard that.  Oh, the mullet is the best hairdo ever.  Dude, I love the tail.  The little short hair with the little piece of thin tail.  The little rat tail.  Oh, yeah.  How are those cool?  I don't know.  They never were.  Before we go to break, I just want to let everyone know, Bob Kelly's coming in here today.  Cool. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, and now you're going to discuss your trip?  We've got to get this fly fishing thing.  Yeah, you've got to get that hammered down, nailed down a date, and everything.  No, he's got a date.  Oh, he does?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's you.  And now we've got that.  And the wise are just going to go out shopping while you and him are in the woods alone.  Dude, yeah, they suck a dick.  And then he does that kind of nowhere.  He's casting his line.  Yeah, they just suck another guy's cock.  Dude, it's not gay.  You see him and J.W. Trout teaming up on you?  It's not gay, because we're fly fishing.  Fucking Kelly. 
[01:01:00]  Email me all the time.  Did you get your room yet?  So we'll have to discuss when.  Bob wants to kneel in the water, and he wants the water to be chest deep on him while he  holds your thighs and suckles you.  He wants to hold your rubber pants and suck your dick while you're fishing.  And hear the swishing of the water as he goes in and out and pulls your buttocks towards  him.  He doesn't.  You'd look down, and he'd wear one of those hats, so all you'd see is his juicy lips  on your fucking hog.  Yeah, the brim of his fishing hat with his lures in there.  Oh, God.  He'd be kneeling in the water. 
[01:01:30]  It's cold.  Little rocks.  Pebbles hurting his knees.  He's got wrinkled fingers, and he's holding your rubber pant-wearing thighs.  Fucking body.  Oh, it's going to be a miserable weekend.  It's okay, dude.  I don't think I can back out.  Because now I'm doing it for the radio show.  Now I know I can't back out.  Oh, you have to.  This sounds fun.  All right, why don't we take a quick break, and we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony, starring little Jimmy Norton.  Yes. 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Cole fucking Cade.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  I didn't forget about that.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you guys think of this little band called the Beatles?  Still making money.  Still cashing in.  Fucking Lennon died, what, 28 years ago?  Oh, my God.  29, maybe?  What year was it?  80?  1980, right?  Damn.  Pushing almost 30 years there. 
[01:02:30]  Yep.  And the entire remastered Beatles catalog is released today.  You think they're going to sell a few of those?  I know I read a Twitter last night from a certain Travis, who was very excited about  it and knew I will be picking it up.  I'm going right after work.  Are you?  Oh, yeah.  I can't wait.  Big Beatles fan?  Uh, yeah, and this is cool.  Like, the CDs came out in 1987.  I love talking to Travis because he's like this man behind the curtain somewhere.  Yeah, it's just a disembodied voice. 
[01:03:00]  But he's not a man and there's no curtain.  He's like the banker on Deal or No Deal.  You don't really see that guy.  We don't see Travis either.  Disembodied.  So you're not really a big Beatles fan?  No, I am.  And this is the first time since 1987 that any of the Beatles catalog has been, like,  remastered.  Like, they came out on CD 22 years ago.  But they sound good already.  Yeah, but that was remastered.  What does remastered mean?  What do they take out fucking cricket chirps we didn't hear?  Yeah, so you got Ringo's fucking everything Ringo contributed.  Yeah.  Made it better. 
[01:03:30]  So the dog can enjoy it more?  Well, I mean, what can they possibly do to make those songs sound better?  Well, think of technology 22 years ago and think of technology now.  What does remastering a sound mean?  Like, they take the original studio tracks and, you know.  You can brighten things up.  Yeah, it's like putting a movie out on Blu-ray.  Digi-tot.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just a moneymaker.  Exactly.  You know, man.  They're going to sound a lot better.  The vinyl, man.  Really?  People miss the vinyl, dude.  I know.  I like the Beatles.  When I hear a Beatles song, I turn it up a little bit and I enjoy it. 
[01:04:00]  I don't need to hear it even more better.  And plus, there's mono CDs that are coming out and stereo CDs that are coming out today.  See, you know what it is?  It sounds better louder, too.  Like, if you crank up old fucking music, it sounds like shit.  This, you could crank it up pretty fast.  We're defending the remastered Beatles catalog.  Yeah, I like the remastering of music.  How much is it?  I'm all for it.  The CDs are 12 bucks and then, like, you know.  Oh, they're not reselling the whole thing together at one piece? 
[01:04:30]  No, you can buy it.  How much?  The box set is 200.  For all the Beatles shit?  For the 13 albums.  What's your favorite Beatles song?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know.  I know that's a tough question.  Probably one of the obvious ones, like, you know, Yesterday or Let It Be.  I like the anthology versions of Yesterday and they also have anthology versions of Let  It Be are good, too.  I'd have to say In My Life is probably my favorite Beatles song.  Yeah, there's a good one.  You know that I was reading an article on radio here in New York, because that's a lot of fun. 
[01:05:00]  And you know there's a station called Light FM?  Yes, of course.  And you know they don't play the Beatles?  Why?  You are joking, right?  Nope.  Because they don't want to sound too old.  Really?  That's what's happening with the Beatles, finally.  They're oldies.  The Beatles are almost done as a band.  They're just old.  Because if the Light FM type stations are starting to, you know, not play them because they don't  want to, you know, sound, have their sound sound dated.  Yeah.  That's what's going on.  Well, the oldies station will play them.  Well, Light FM is... 
[01:05:30]  Oh, I guess they're not oldies.  They're just light.  Yeah, they're just light.  I see.  But oldies will play them.  And then things like, you know what you can't find anymore, or I believe you can't find  it anymore, and not that I care, like doo-wop.  Because I remember growing up, the oldies stations was doo-wop.  That was your oldies.  Sure.  It was like, oh, fucking oldies station.  Doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop.  Worst sound ever.  Horrible.  Horrendous.  I hated it.  There was no place for that. 
[01:06:00]  I hated it.  Enough of the doo-wop.  Doo-wop.  And enough of, you know, sitting on a stoop somewhere and singing a little ditty.  Oh, God, you're right.  That's what the teacher told me when she'd give me an assignment.  Doo-wop.  See, because he's Italian.  Co-fucking-caps!  Jimmy just gave me a look of death.  No, no, no, no.  It just sounded like you just skied into a tree.  Don't think I forgot the bit I'm dying to hear. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, no.  Where is the bit?  Uh, E-Rock's, uh, running it in.  Yeah, he's looking for it as we talk.  Oh, God, please no.  Yeah, the doo-wop and the singing from a stoop.  There was never a place for that.  I'm sorry.  With the fire going.  Oh, yeah, they're all around a barrel.  Yeah, a barrel.  And singing their doo-wop songs and their acapella harmonies.  Ooh, ah, ah.  Yeah.  Right.  Uh, but, yeah, you can't, uh, hear the doo-wop anymore.  No, that's not a bad thing. 
[01:07:00]  No, not at all.  But that used to be the oldies.  Like, oh, I remember, you know, driving in the car and with your parents or some shit.  And it would be like, you know, oh, we'll put on this.  There it is.  How did this guy get laid?  This is not bad.  I kind of like this stuff.  It's so popular.  This is not bad.  That's where words go now.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, there he goes.  Yeah.  Harmonizing with your pals?  Yeah.  How gay was that?  You be the deep one.  All right.  And they'd all wear, like, ties.  All the black guys would have conked, like, really, really, like, white guy hair with,  like, gel in it.  It would be all, like, lined.  Yeah.  Burnt to a crisp so it was straight.  So, yes. 
[01:08:00]  The other thing with the Beatles, a rock band video game released today.  Yeah.  That's going to sell a few copies, huh?  Yeah.  I saw that on TV.  I saw a little thing, and you could see they have different versions of the Beatles based  on their era.  Mm-hmm.  So when you're playing the songs on the screen, there's, like, you know, the old I-want-to-hold-your-hand  Beatles, and there's the Sgt. Pepper's Beatles.  How much money did Yoko make for making that deal? 
[01:08:30]  I hope none.  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, nothing right.  Oh, did she friggin' just...  She won lifetime lotto.  Wow.  Amazing.  Never remarried.  We have the remastered Beatles songs, if you want to hear one, do we?  Yeah, yeah, let's hear it.  In all its digital charm.  Do we have the original first?  Give me the original.  And then...  And no difference you will hear.  I know.  None.  Or the difference will be so slight, who cares?  Exactly. 
[01:09:00]  It's going to sound fuller.  Yes.  And we're all going to love it.  All right, what song?  How about you play both and we see if we can tell which is which?  Well, I think Danny's got them.  Yeah, you guys pick.  I mean, I have 16 albums here of remastered material.  But we want to hear the original first.  That's fine, but we need to pick a song.  Okay.  Well, we need one that has a lot going on.  Yeah, what has a lot going on?  Let It Be has great piano.  That's a pretty...  That is a pretty, like, complex song.  And, like, da-da-dun, like, when it starts with just the piano, you can really hear a fucking flaw. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, how about that?  All right.  But don't tell us which is which.  Just play one and we'll see if we can guess, or do you want to know the old one first?  Well, we're also getting a request for some Sha-na-na.  I think Sha-na-na is wonderful.  Sha-na-na by Dave.  I like when Bowser makes the muscle and opens his mouth real wide.  Oh, it makes me laugh every time.  I never laughed at that.  Oh, literal, Jim.  Co-fucking-Cade!  Do the best!  No way. 
[01:10:00]  No way.  This is garbage.  Now, not ever.  All right, let's hear Let It Be.  Are we going to hear the original?  The original first?  Yeah, let's hear the original first.  Okay, original first.  Piece of shit!  I can't hear the piano.  Oh, I'm talking.  Okay.  Now, let's wait for the vocals.  When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me, speaking words of wisdom, 
[01:10:30]  let it be.  All right, stop right now.  Yes.  All right?  Okay, stop.  Let's hear the new one.  Now, new one.  Go.  It did sound a little muddy.  All right.  Here it is.  Oh.  Hold on.  You can hear it already.  It's louder, stupid.  When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me, speaking words of wisdom. 
[01:11:00]  It's brighter, man.  Yeah.  It is really, like, brighter.  It is.  It doesn't make a difference, though.  It isn't as muddy.  Yes.  Yeah, this, I can hear the difference.  That really makes a difference.  Believe me.  Were you going to go out and get this?  Yes.  Yeah, I would.  I think you've got to be a hardcore Beatles fan to go get this shit.  Right when the piano started, it's like, all right, that's brighter, man.  All right, they've washed it a little bit.  Yeah, listen to this.  All right, listen to the background.  Ooh-oohs.  Right?  How about I just let it play, because it's fucking great.  Little hi-hat? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Toodly-doo.  Ooh.  Toodly-doo.  Toodle-toot.  Toodle.  Toodly.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Ooh.  I hear something in the new version.  Let it be.  Let it be. 
[01:12:00]  Let it be.  Let it be.  Yeah, there will be answers.  Let it be.  Ooh.  Let it be.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-toot.  Toodly-toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Ooh.  Cole fucking Kane.  Oh, I never heard that before.  All right, let's fade that out.  It's remastered. 
[01:12:30]  You know what?  A few people saying I am the walrus would be a good test.  I have to say that's much.  There's a little more going on with I am the walrus.  All right, let's hear that.  Oh, so you want E-Rock in here again?  Poor E-Rock.  It's so unnecessary.  I know.  I was thinking Paul...  Paul fucking Kane.  Paul fucking Kane.  I was going to say poor fucking walruses, but I couldn't say it right.  I went poor fucking Rorford.  How did you have a stroke, folks? 
[01:13:00]  Ah, shit.  Can we hear I am the walrus?  K-Koo.  K-choo.  I just want to make sure...  Hurry up!  I'll have it.  All right, this is the original.  Here's the original.  Oh, okay.  I leave the volume the same.  On my left ear.  People really love the left side.  I know.  Of course they do.  Left side.  Lefties.  A little stereo thing.  Because of Paul McCartney, he's a lefty, right?  And they're a little liberal.  Boo.  Boo.  Here we go.  Give me something in my right ear.  Yeah, you got a little...  Where's the right?  I have it in both. 
[01:13:30]  You got the bass end in there.  Yeah, but I still got that other sound on the left.  I am he as you are, he as you are me, and we are all together.  Fucking love this song.  How could you not?  See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly.  I'm crying.  Sitting on a cornflake.  Where's it for the vine to come?  Corporation t-shirts. 
[01:14:00]  Chippin' pitty juice.  They're only people.  Oh, it's the remix.  I hate people who hate the Beatles.  Wow, that's a double hate.  Because I love them.  I hate the early Beatles.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  Those pop songs.  The tootally toot.  All right, let's try to go with the remix.  Here we go.  Here we go.  What do you need?  What?  What?  What?  Which one?  Oh, Jesus.  Over here?  Oh.  You guys ready?  Yeah.  Oh, they're coming from different sources, too, though. 
[01:14:30]  Okay, well.  Whoa.  All right, now the right side is a lot more EQ'd.  Yeah, but the volume might be louder.  The right side's more EQ'd.  You can hear the right side better, though.  Oh, listen to the bottom end.  I like the bass.  Yep.  You can hear the bass a little better.  I am he, as you are he, as you are me, and we are all together.  See how they run like pigs from a gun. 
[01:15:00]  See how they fly.  Okay.  Sitting on a concage.  Waiting for the band to come.  Toot-a-toot-a-dee-ta-toot-a-dee-doo.  Stay man, you've been a naughty boy.  I let your bass grow low.  I am the Eggman.  They are the Eggman.  I am the werewolf.  I am the werewolf. 
[01:15:30]  I am the werewolf.  Wow, they really remastered.  You know, this fucking demonstration is selling me.  Yes.  I'm going to pick this up.  But you'll have to delete all your old Beatles except the ontology.  Yes.  Right?  Yes.  All right, we can figure this out.  Wow, that's pretty fucking good.  Yeah, it's just...  You know what?  Where can I get this?  The way that was EQ'd.  I got to admit it, too, man.  That's solid.  Yeah.  So what you have to do is this.  That's pretty solid.  So your iPod doesn't get overcrowded, right? 
[01:16:00]  You got to take the Beatles you have, delete them off your computer, and off your iPod or  computer first?  Both.  iPod.  Both.  Then your computer.  Yeah.  Then you put them on your computer and you sync up your iPod.  And then you put your iPhone right on a magnet.  Oh.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  To make sure it's all clean.  What is that, Steve?  It's what you wanted to hear.  Oh.  How do you put in your resignation?  Yeah, I'm kidding.  Holy shit. 
[01:16:30]  It's what you wanted to hear.  Oh.  That was mean spirit.  Step into that bear trap.  I do it every fucking time.  What is that?  I don't know.  Don't tell me if it is that.  I'd love to hear what I wanted to hear.  I can't read.  Come on.  I didn't.  Is there an S-E-K-I in there?  What?  Oh, God, no.  I can't read this.  Oh, no, no.  I think it says Mike of the Kennedy.  I'm not really sure.  Oh, no, no, no. 
[01:17:00]  Come on.  It says douche chill.  Melanie wants to hear happiness is a warm gun.  Melanie.  I have both versions, if you will.  Melanie.  Yes.  Yeah.  Are you hot?  Yeah, I'm pretty hot.  Describe yourself.  5'3", 120.  Do you have a brand new pair of roller skates?  Yeah.  Melanie.  Stop it.  No, I can't roller skates.  5'3", 120, cute.  Literal Melanie. 
[01:17:30]  I'm 26.  I'm not, you know.  Looks like you're not hearing.  That's okay.  Oh, that song.  I never heard that song.  I'm a Beatles hack.  Like, I like the Beatles, the fucking, the, the, the, the, the, the hits.  I feel like I am a walrus.  That's not hacky.  That's on, that's on the big.  That's a bit, that's a bit deep for the Beatles.  I like the two, the two greatest hits albums, like the red and the green, or blue.  Those are the albums I love.  Let's get something off, some of that big fucking wall of sound, Sergeant Pepper fucking. 
[01:18:00]  Not Sergeant Pepper's though.  I never loved that song.  No, no, no, no.  But I mean, I mean one of those songs.  Day in the Life.  Like Lucy in the Sky or something like that.  Like just a big fucking song.  All right, let's do it.  Big sound.  Yeah, let's go with this.  Can we get that from the same source though?  I don't like the fact we're doing one from the computer and one from the board.  I've got both of them.  It's the same file.  A source is a source, of course, of course.  Like the files that, the files that are coming.  Why?  That was kind of cute.  I just hit myself for saying that.  Why?  A source is a source, of course, of course. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Ugh, aunt.  Of course, ugh.  Thank you, Frunkus.  As you said that, flame should have just shot out of your microphone and burned you.  A source is a...  God damn, I'm an asshole.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, I hear Foundry is releasing a remastered version of Pendulum.  That would be something.  It could be a direct-to-dumpster.  Any truth to that rumor?  So is there...  It is.  But the source, is it different or no? 
[01:19:00]  Would it make a difference?  It's fine, Jimmy.  The files that I have here are the same files that are in there.  It's digital.  It's good enough.  Just use your ears.  It's all digital.  You could hear like...  They're coming out of a different room.  Okay.  But in this case, they're both going to come from Travis.  I thought one was coming offline and one was coming...  All right, Travis, the original.  Let's go.  Original.  Here we go.  This is shit.  Right.  Groovy.  Again, the left ear first.  Picture yourself in a boat on a river.  Get this out of my left ear.  With tangerine trees.  Maybe I'll be here a little bit. 
[01:19:30]  And marmalade skies.  Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly.  A girl with kaleidos go by.  I can tell what it's going to sound like remastered just listening to this.  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to be a lot bigger.  Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone. 
[01:20:00]  Lucy in the sky would die.  I can hear the new one.  Boom.  Right to it.  Already.  Too much of the last.  Picture yourself in a boat on a river.  It's mixed so much better.  With tangerine trees and marmalade skies. 
[01:20:30]  Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly.  A girl with kaleidos go by.  Set a baby flowers up yellow in the green.  Towering over your head.  Wow.  That bass.  You hear a lot more bass.  Yep.  All right.  Let's hear the chorus here. 
[01:21:00]  There's so much more going on.  Well, but Tim in South Carolina makes a very good point.  Yeah.  Tim, what's going on?  This bit is great for people listening on their XM satellite radio, so we'll never hear  the difference over the bandwidth that's going through.  You know what?  He's right.  It just sounds like shite for you.  All right. 
[01:21:30]  Cole fucking Kane.  All right.  You got one for that.  When does the catalog come out?  Today.  Today.  Today.  But he's right.  I'm going to pick that up.  He's right with the bandwidth problem that this channel has.  Well, it's a talk channel, technically, so it's not cut out for music, so they cut the  bandwidth down.  So, you know, even my toodly-doo flute probably doesn't sound as good as it does in here.  I know.  I wonder what skiing bits sound like with a low bandwidth.  Shut up.  What are you talking about?  I thought everybody would forget.  No.  What are you talking about?  Oh.  Well, we got Bob Kelly.  Oh, he's on for another 40 minutes.  Embarrassing. 
[01:22:00]  What are you talking about?  I would love to hear it.  I bet.  Sometimes you guys think a bit is bad, and it's actually not.  When did that ever happen?  Quite a few times it's happened.  I want to kill you.  Oh, you're setting us up, Jimmy.  No.  We're not stupid.  I know.  Well, you are, but.  Well, Mike Kennedy.  As you said, we're not stupid.  I'd love to show a montage of mistakes that were made over the years.  Just stupidity.  What's that, E-Rock?  A gut?  The monarch. 
[01:22:30]  What does that shirt mean?  It says the monarch in orange Halloween writing, and in the O, instead of it being a circle,  it's a skull.  It's a skull.  It's from the TV show, The Venture Brothers.  What the fuck is that?  What is that?  It's a show that you guys don't watch.  It's still on?  Yeah.  Where?  What is it?  It's an animated show on the Cartoon Network.  Ah.  Okay.  It's very good.  Is it?  Yes.  Very good.  Ah.  Which one's the monarch?  What's good about that? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, the butterfly.  The monarch butterfly.  Yeah.  Is it a comedy or a series?  It's a comedy.  Okay.  It's dirty.  Oh, don't swim?  There's a lot of profanity.  Oh, wow.  Gosh.  Wait, before we get to E-Rock.  Watch his dirty cartoons and he likes it.  Scott in Jersey has a very good point about the remastered Beatles.  I don't want to lose him.  Scott in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, the remastered Beatles stuff sounds so good you can actually hear the tumor forming  in Harrison's head.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:23:30]  That's very clear quality.  Jesus.  All right, back to you.  That's how they sold it in stores?  If that was on the signs?  That's their slug line.  It's so good you can hear Mark Chapman going, ahem.  Sir?  E-Rock.  You made a mention about Foundry possibly being digitally remastered.  Yes.  And we have one.  No way.  Yes.  How did that happen?  Apparently, somebody hired a producer and had it done.  And got the tracks?  Yep. 
[01:24:00]  The original tracks.  What?  Wait a minute.  It had come to my attention that this whole album was being reproduced.  These aren't the original tracks.  This is completely, if it's what I think it is,  it's completely redone, re-recorded with an updated style.  By who?  R.U.P. Steve Carlisi.  And how did we get it?  Ah, we got it.  Does Steve know we got it?  So Steve sang this?  Re-sang the whole thing? 
[01:24:30]  Mega produced.  Mega produced.  Mega produced.  For the new millennium.  At least a few months ago.  Because we've been sitting around for a while.  Do we have the original so we can compare?  Yeah.  Of course.  Here comes the little instigating fuck Sam to come in and add his barbs.  I just looked over at Steve to make sure he was listening.  And he looked at me with wide eyes and said,  Where'd they get this?  Oh, shit.  No, really?  Do we have the original so we can compare? 
[01:25:00]  Of course we do.  The track we have, I believe it's What Kills Me, if I'm not mistaken.  Do we know that track?  Yeah.  Do you want to give a little...  We don't have Pendulum?  Yeah, the Pendulum would be the big get.  Oh, that is the get.  What Kills Me was the follow-up single.  Yeah.  Do we have the original What Kills Me?  Yeah.  All right, let's hear the original What Kills Me from the band Foundry.  Marr.  Steve's old band.  It's like deep purple. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, or the opening of the Terminator.  Holy shit.  Be careful, snake.  All right with this.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Now we're rocking.  It's produced a little thin, right? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Unlike...  I want to live.  I want to dream.  I want to fly.  I want to die.  I'm the force of my intention.  Intention.  You're just compromised.  I want to love.  I want to hate.  I want to turn and deviate.  From a state of aggression and my mind of detention.  Once what's human has been shattered.  No theory of fighting magic.  All that's left of me is shattered.  Drive to hide. 
[01:26:30]  The pain I feel is hard.  And now I feel.  It's real.  And cannot be concealed.  For you will hear.  A cheering night is doing what you will get.  Then you might just see what kills me.  All right.  Let's do this.  Co-fucking-K.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Danny likes Foundry.  Wow.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  That song has been remastered.  And we have it for the first time.  Redone.  Completely redone.  Re-recorded.  All right.  Here we go.  Re-recorded for the new millennium. 
[01:27:00]  Before they forget, I want to play it right away.  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  All right.  A bit of a difference.  Oh, damn. 
[01:27:30]  No resemblance to the original.  I want to live.  I want to dream.  I want to fly.  I want to die.  And the cause of my existence isn't yours to compromise.  I want to love.  I want to hate.  I want to turn. 
[01:28:00]  Deviate from my state of depression.  And my mind of detention.  What was human has been shattered.  No degree of fighting matter.  All that's left of me is scattered.  Try to hide the pain I feel inside.  But how I feel is real.  It cannot be concealed.  So you will hear a cheer.  When I destroy what you hold dear.  Then you just might see. 
[01:28:30]  What kills me?  Oh, there you go.  It's good, man.  Well, someone's saying the original sounds better.  No way.  Sounds, let's see, sounds like better shit.  Why does he do this to himself?  I think it's good, man.  Some people are digging it.  Some people like the original better.  I like the new version much better.  I think it's a better song.  It got a little noisy right near the end.  Pendulum.  Pat Romonaki says,  Pendulum will be playing at Tech Noir on Peacow Boulevard. 
[01:29:00]  Explain that one.  That's what I get with the Terminator.  The part she went to to hang out late for a while.  Oh, fucking Pat.  Are you Steve Carlesi?  I like this, man.  That's a good one.  I'll tell you when.  I'll tell you why. 
[01:29:30]  I'll tell you lies.  Till you cry.  Tell you what you want to hear.  Cause I'm the devil in disguise.  Fuck it.  I'll bring you pain.  I'll bring you down.  Cause I was treated like a clown.  I'm going to feed you all those words you said.  Make you choke them down.  Why?  Once was human, it has been shattered.  No degree of fighting matter.  All that's left of me is scattered.  I tried to.  There's a little bit of a lot of stuff going on in there.  There's so much stuff going on in there. 
[01:30:00]  I hear a little nin.  I like it, though.  It's a lot like Megadeth.  Well, Megadeth's album called Risk.  A little disturbed in there, too, right?  Yeah.  Been it disturbed or not?  It's not bad.  No, I think it did a nice job.  Ain't going to sell shit, but it's all right.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, don't hurt the little guy's dreams.  He's 40-something years old.  What the fuck?  Take it on the road.  Rockin'.  He's not that old, I guess.  I don't know how old he is. 
[01:30:30]  Who knows how old Steve is?  Is he singing this in his capris?  When did Foundry become a corn tribute band?  Robert and Marilyn.  A little corn.  See, I don't listen to corn.  Is that sound like corn?  I don't even know what they sound like.  Yeah.  All right.  We should maybe take a break here, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  As quickly as possible.  We should take a break.  Before we do, though, because Steve is coming down the hallway.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's switch gears a little bit and play a skiing bit.  Come on, guys. 
[01:31:00]  We can't follow up a douche chill with a douche chill, can we?  It's safe to say this bit is 12 years old.  Steve's wasn't a douche chill.  Maybe well.  13 years old.  Steve was surprisingly good.  No, actually, Steve came through in that one.  I really thought it was going to be, you know, bad.  I liked it.  Thank you, sweetie.  Did you sing that?  Because the original was very dated.  No, I didn't sing that.  That was...  You're not even singing on it?  No.  The original plan was to actually re-sing the entire thing, but I couldn't get to Brooklyn  to re-sing tracks.  So those are basically...  Why would you get to Brooklyn to sing tracks for your own stuff? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, that doesn't make sense.  That doesn't make sense at all.  Because the producer has his own studio.  Brooklyn's right over there.  I understand that, but the producer has his own stuff, and he just works on his own time.  So when he has time, I don't necessarily have time.  He did a Carleese impression.  Yeah, basically.  So that's actually not even mastered yet.  Steve, that's bullshit.  No.  I got to call bullshit.  Come on.  It's your shit, and you don't have time to work around his schedule to redo the vocals?  That's not...  I can't accept that.  Oh, I can redo it.  I can redo it.  I just haven't redone it yet.  You've decided to let him do the vocals. 
[01:32:00]  Why wouldn't you get to Brooklyn?  I'm going to.  I'm going to.  Just I haven't done it yet.  You're going to do the vocals?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to redo it.  You're going to do it with that kind of emotion he has?  So what?  Of course.  So what?  He did it to show you what it could sound like?  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  Well, that makes more sense.  Thank you.  All right.  I didn't explain it properly, but that was exactly it.  I like that.  But yeah, they haven't been mastered.  They haven't been completely redone, but there's about six tracks that have been redone.  Was Pendulum redone?  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, give it to us.  That's what we want to hear.  We've already heard it, actually.  I think we already have it in the system.  It was one of the ones that was renowned for the contest.  Oh.  Pendulum's number one in Japan. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, you went with the guy that made your song sound really good.  Yeah.  Foundry Music's version of Pendulum.  I thought that voice sounded familiar.  Remember the guy that redid Pendulum?  We're all like, holy my God.  Yeah, yeah.  I really cranked it.  Yeah, yeah.  That was him.  Now it all makes sense.  Now it's all coming together.  So you're not redoing the vocals, obviously.  I'm going to.  You're just going to use this guy.  No.  There's a couple songs where I want to redo the vocals.  It's just...  See, now it's down to a couple songs.  You're falling apart.  Are you doing all the vocals or just a few maybe? 
[01:33:00]  I would like to do them all.  You're having a monumental collapse right now.  No, I'm not.  I do like the way...  You define it as a monumental collapse.  You realize that this guy just kicked your song to another level.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's why I did six of them and not just one.  That was a good one.  All right.  Thank you.  Mike of the Kennedys.  Yeah, Jimmy, this is what you're talking about.  It's like 12 or 13 years old.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait.  Oh, but is this Boston or New York?  This is Boston.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  This is AF shit. 
[01:33:30]  Mike Kennedy what?  I don't even remember.  He was playing football or something on the ski slope.  You know those Kennedys?  They love their football.  As they ski.  They played it as they were skiing.  You know, they toss around the football back and forth.  And he veered off into the woods and hit a tree and killed himself.  With all the disaster that family has had, why would you play football on a ski slope?  It should be a bubble family.  Why would you take that chance?  Really?  It should be a bubble family.  Because no matter what you do, you're going to die.  Don't joke when yogurt is in your mouth.  I thought you were working on a point. 
[01:34:00]  I was.  And then I realized I had yogurt in my mouth.  A lot of the Kennedys dying young, though.  Yeah.  That family is cursed.  All right.  So he crashed into a tree and died.  And, you know, we had to acknowledge that.  Yes, of course.  So we did with this.  Oh, God.  Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys, Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys, Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys, Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys, Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys, Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys, Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys, Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys. 
[01:34:30]  Era, era, era.  Oh, no, era.  Watch out for me.  Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys, Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedys.  Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedy's.  I'm going to follow me.  It's cartoony. 
[01:35:00]  You know what?  It's not bad.  It's from George of the Jungle.  Right.  With George, George, George of the Jungle.  But Mike, Mike, Mike of the Kennedy's.  And watch out for the tree because he hit it.  That's not bad.  Honestly, it's not so bad.  Why am I sweating?  Because you were expecting it to be worse.  But it's, eh, I can't even shit on it.  It's just kind of funny and it was mean.  It's all right.  Yeah, it's.  So I really hope I had my hopes set much higher.  Oh, good.  Glad you were disappointed. 
[01:35:30]  Tremendously.  All I want to do now is eat my yogurt.  All right.  I'll pull my fly down.  I like how you call it your yogurt.  I know.  Everyone knows it's hepatitis.  Ah, shit.  Oh, Kenny, thank you.  This must mean it's time for a break.  It certainly is.  All right, thank you, Kenny.  Wow, this costs $6.79.  $2.20.  My God, Manhattan's amazing.  $2.20 for a bagel?  Oh, boy.  It's like Christmas.  Is there a schmear on it? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, they schmeared it.  I want a bagel with a schmear.  They schmeared it up a little bit.  Yeah, they did.  What's on your bagel?  I got a little bit of turkey with one slice of melted American cheese on an everything bagel.  Or an onion bagel.  I lost interest.  Onion bagel.  All right.  Let's go to break so we can eat.  Eat your fucking gum.  My heart gets heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You change me into something that I just can't control. 
[01:36:30]  And you see me come to let's get out of my way.  The best of love is bringing back the other way.  Opie and Anthony, Bob Kelly's going to be in studio in, I don't know, about 40 minutes  to talk about fly fishing.  Yay!  More talk about fly fishing.  Can't wait.  Oh, yeah.  Can't fucking wait.  Football starts tomorrow.  Holy shit.  The season?  Tomorrow's the day.  Wow.  NFL kicks off their season tomorrow night.  Titans and the Steelers going at it. 
[01:37:00]  I can't be bothered.  You can't be bothered?  Not until baseball's done.  Wow.  What a shot.  Oh, God.  My baseball season's over, so it's time to start rooting for the Jets.  I want to start watching the Yankees.  Really?  Yeah, I want to see.  You're breaking down, huh, Jimmy?  I might as well.  Jump on.  What the fuck?  You'd be seeing a great season so far.  I'm watching new players.  Yeah.  Jeter's choking a little bit.  He's under a lot of pressure.  Four away from Lou Gehrig's hit record for the Yankees.  If it was anyone but Jeter, you'd think like, oh, you're trying to get Jeter. 
[01:37:30]  Went 0 for 4 last night.  I know.  I think he's 0 for 12.  Two games in a row.  0 for 12.  Three in a row.  Three in a row.  But he'll get it.  The double header.  He's got to relax a little bit.  Imagine they just fired him for choking, for going over the floor.  Yeah, he's out.  They just release him.  Beat it, stupid.  Yeah, leave.  We're sent to the minors.  Send them back down.  Yes.  Where he has to wear that awkward uniform.  Yes.  Dumb minor league uniform that almost looks like a Yankees uniform.  So bizarre. 
[01:38:00]  Let's get out of my way.  Well, we got another home run call.  The Yankees won again last night.  Yeah.  What an exciting victory last night for the Yankees.  They were playing the Rays.  And my goodness.  Up until the eighth, they were winning.  And then they gave up a run.  Tied it up 2-2.  And wow.  Sounds like you're actually watching these games. 
[01:38:30]  I cannot get enough of watching Yankees games now.  Are you watching them downstairs?  Yeah, I watch them either.  No, I've been watching them upstairs, too.  Or sitting by the bar is nice, too.  It's got the TV there.  You can just sit at the bar, drink.  Or, yeah, in the theater.  But, yeah, I like the bar area for watching a bowl game.  I got a good set, too.  I got to start watching again.  But it was great.  And then, wow.  Swisher.  Is that his name?  Nick Swisher.  Yeah.  Here we go. 
[01:39:00]  He jacked one.  Another Johnson Sterling home run call.  Ball game tied at 2.  Here in the bottom of the ninth.  One out.  No one on.  The pitch.  There it goes to deep right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Nick Swisher has ended the ball game.  A one out.  Bottom of the ninth.  Walk off home run.  His second home run of the game.  There you go.  It's all you need, right? 
[01:39:30]  It wasn't bad.  It's fine.  I like stopping it a lot, actually.  I like stopping it right there.  Right where he should end it.  There you go.  That's a good home run call.  That's all you need.  There's a lot of excitement.  That's all you need.  Oh, is he ever swish-alicious.  Nick Swisher ends it.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  What a fucking asshole. 
[01:40:00]  Boy, is he ever swish-alicious.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  And he goes, oh, is he ever swish-alicious.  And Nick Swisher has to live with that awful name.  I know.  I don't think he wants anyone pumping it up even more.  Yeah, he probably caught some shit as a kid.  No kidding.  Nick Swisher.  Now he's Swisher-licious.  Oh, that is just great to watch.  You like that, Jimmy?  I hate it.  I hate it.  Look at Jimmy.  It's embarrassing. 
[01:40:30]  It's not catchy.  He's just a fucking...  Look.  It's like he's fucking...  What is wrong with him?  He's trying too hard to be a broadcast legend.  Yeah.  No one will miss you when you leave.  Swish-alicious.  Come on.  You think he got attention as a kid?  Oh, no.  Nobody noticed him.  No one.  He was just Fat John.  I think this has to do with the lack of attention he was getting growing up.  Of course it does.  Swish-alicious.  I'm with you. 
[01:41:00]  Wasn't he always guilty of that with other things he broadcast, though?  Of being the...  Hey, man.  The Yankees hired him.  You know, it's the Yankees' fault.  Of course it is.  And I still don't know if the fans like it or not.  If he ends up being the good luck charm this season, then fuck it.  I'll listen to his stupid calls.  A little info on the Swisher home run call.  Let's say hi to Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  What's going on, boys?  Hello.  Hey, Swisher actually asked John Sterling to say that. 
[01:41:30]  Come on.  No way, Jose.  Yes, it was on Mike and Mike a couple weeks ago.  He called him in the locker room and asked him that.  How about this?  I don't give a shit why he says it.  I don't care.  How about if Nick Swisher said, hey, could you say balls on my face instead of ball game over?  Balls on my face.  No doubt.  I can't wait until he slips and gets himself fired.  Oh.  I can't wait until he does it. 
[01:42:00]  By, like, putting the N-word in one of his funny little...  Or just something.  Oh, Hideki Matsui.  It's a Jap ball.  Wait a minute.  Well, he almost did that when Matsui hit a home run and he said, an A-bomb.  Oh.  Well, if A-Rod would have hit it.  Yes.  It's like, oh, well, the Japanese guy doesn't want to hear A-bomb ever.  That's right.  But since it killed his grandparents, an A-bomb.  He'll screw up and get fired one day.  Nick.  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  I was watching ESPN this morning, early this morning, and they showed that home run.  And I was like, oh, this is going to be good.  They're going to put John, I guess his name's John Sterling.  Yeah.  Georgia.  And they edited out all that stuff you just played.  It was a totally different call.  Well, it was probably the TV call.  He only does the radio call.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, they used his.  But they cut out the garbage at the end?  Yeah, they cut out.  Good.  Good for ESPN. 
[01:43:00]  Oh.  They don't even want to deal with him?  No.  Because he gives a good.  He actually does a great call.  Just he fucking.  I've never seen anybody go for such a great call to absolutely make me want to push him  out the fucking broadcast.  Once again, making it about himself.  Yeah, exactly.  Not about you, John.  Just making it about himself.  Is he expecting a World Series ring if the Yankees win again?  I think so, yeah.  One of your 212 TVs in there, put it on.  And when that highlight comes on, you'll hear a different one than what you just played. 
[01:43:30]  We're down a TV in here.  Not happy about it.  Okay, so you're into double digits now?  We've been down a TV for a while.  It's close to triple digits?  Yeah, we're right.  Y'all have a good day.  We're not happy about it.  Yeah.  And what happened?  You're a big Orioles fan, Travis, are you?  Yeah.  Wow, that was a nice Boston Red Sox blowout.  That's 12 consecutive losing seasons for me.  Yes.  Really?  Yeah.  A 10-0 loss to the Sox.  What a shitty organization.  They used to be so good.  There was one team worse than the Orioles, Travis. 
[01:44:00]  The Pittsburgh Pirates.  That's right.  They are now 17 straight losing seasons.  17 straight losing seasons.  Which is a sports record.  Wait, have they had 17 straight even with the new stadium?  Yes.  Surprisingly, that didn't make the players better.  What a bunch of bums.  Bum.  Fucking 17 straight.  Get the fuck.  Just stop watching them.  What year does that go back to?  92?  Yeah.  Wow.  They haven't had a winning season since 92? 
[01:44:30]  No team in baseball, football, hockey, or basketball has ever had a longer streak.  A 17 consecutive losing season.  You know what you got to do as the fans?  Stop you assholes in Pittsburgh from going to these fucking games.  They're not doing it for you.  Wow.  What did Barry Bonds play for the Pirates?  Who was the Bonds?  He played in the late 80s, though.  Did he play with the funny hats?  Might be.  He didn't play with the funny hats.  No, I think that was in the 70s.  I liked the funny hats. 
[01:45:00]  Striped hats.  Where they looked like they were in jail.  Yeah, yeah.  They had the stripes.  Playing in the yard.  And it wasn't even a cap.  It wasn't rounded.  It was square.  It was square with a little pom-pom on top or some shit.  What awful hats they used to have.  Look at that stupid hat.  Wow.  Wow.  Because they wanted to look like pirates.  Was that why?  Yeah.  Willie Stargell had to wear this.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Poor Willie.  They finally gave that up.  Jesus.  That's right. 
[01:45:30]  What a shitty organization.  Pirates, 17 consecutive losing seasons.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  Damn.  Well, what are they?  They fell apart on the road.  It seems like they're doing, I mean, not great at home, but they're 36 and 33 at home.  But on the road, they're 18 and 50.  They must be getting laid a lot on the road.  What are they giving?  Like bad hotel accommodations?  Eight guys to a room.  What?  Just a lumpy bed.  Just taking a look at the standings here, it seems that they have the worst road record 
[01:46:00]  in baseball this year.  You'd have to.  18 and 50?  You don't think they're sleeping comfortably on the road, Jimmy?  Jesus.  Something's going on.  I'm bad, too.  They make them sleep on the back of flatbed trucks in the rain?  Go ahead, guys.  What is it?  The Yankees nine games up on the Sox, and the Sox are two games up on the Rangers for  a wild card, I think, after last night's win.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hope the Sox don't even make the fucking wild card.  I just hope they don't.  Well, I can guarantee they'll win the next two games.  Well, yeah.  I know. 
[01:46:30]  Wait, we got a lot of Pirates fans checking in.  Okay, good.  Let's give them their say.  And fuck you, Boston fans, in advance, because they're going to give me shit, so I don't  care.  Mike.  Mikey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey.  I grew up in Pittsburgh, was a longtime Pittsburgh fan, and the problem is when they got that  Kevin Clatchy, who bought the team, and he basically ran that into the ground.  He got his new stadium, we got the All-Star game, and he thought that would have popped  enough money into the organization.  But they just kicked it away, and we basically became a minor league team for the Yankees 
[01:47:00]  and the Red Sox.  I mean, we got rid of all our prospects, we got rid of Aramis Ramirez for dirt cheap,  and we're just a shitty organization.  It's a shame.  Yeah, I hate it.  We have one of the nicest stadiums in all of baseball.  I hate a bad organization.  I hate when teams...  But is it because there's not enough interest there to generate the...  No, there was enough interest, and the thing was, it got to the point where, I think it  was either last season or the season before, the town actually called for a boycott.  They walked out, like a couple thousand people walked out of the game. 
[01:47:30]  They planned it to show the organization that they sucked.  Last night, they had a celebration for Arnold Palmer's 80th birthday, and all the bigwigs  went out into the field, and they got a rousing boo.  I mean, it was ridiculous.  Poof.  I think...  Sorry, go ahead.  No, I was just saying, it's fucking ridiculous.  You could step on him, Travis.  I think that there's like two or three Pirates that were in the starting lineup on opening day  that are still with the team.  Like, that's how many players they just give away. 
[01:48:00]  Holy shit.  So why don't they sell the team to someone that gives a shit?  Exactly, man.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  But the thing...  Well, because they're actually making a profit, though.  They're turning a profit out of the organization, and they're just not putting it back in.  And now their excuse is that, oh, well, we've invested all this money in our Latin American  scouting report.  What the fuck does it matter?  You're just going to become a Yankee or a Red Sox anyways once they get good.  They're making money that way, I guess.  One of the things that drives me crazy about baseball, you know, your team finally wins 
[01:48:30]  it all, and then the next year it's a completely different team.  Yeah, different team.  Yep.  Like, the owners can't even keep the team in place so you can enjoy watching the guys  that finally brought a championship home.  That always used to drive me nuts.  I mean, it's ridiculous that, you know, everybody, it's only the Penguins in a Steelers town.  They don't even mention the Pirates anymore.  I mean, it's kind of a joke.  They're like the redhead stepchild or like the little retarded brother of the city.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying they're a profit company, the Pirates.  What was the biggest dismantling of a championship team that you remember? 
[01:49:00]  Was it Florida?  Yeah, man.  Help me out.  Yeah, it was definitely Florida when they won their first championship.  Right, right.  They got rid of just everyone.  There was no one left opening day.  They're like, oh, my God, we won the World Series.  There's the World Series flag.  Everyone's excited.  It's like, who's there?  There's nobody.  And it was a bunch of like...  Why did they do that?  Just because, you know, they wanted to make money.  It's amazing.  86 Mets, too.  I remember...  86 Mets, they kind of dismantled.  I remember after that, it was like, wow, you know, and fucking having the Mets win.  Yeah, next year, you come back to watch, and it's like, what the... 
[01:49:30]  Hojo is the first one to go, I think.  Where did everybody go?  Howard Johnson?  Was he?  Yeah.  I believe so.  I remember thinking that was a dumb move for chemistry reasons.  Yeah, let's go to Holly in St. Petersburg.  Holly, I know.  I should be shot for saying that.  Holly.  Good morning.  Good morning, Holly.  Hey, I'm originally from Pittsburgh.  I moved to Tampa five years ago and had to switch to the American League and all that.  Well, you know, the Rays went to a World Series last year, and my boyfriend and I go frequently 
[01:50:00]  to games, and we usually have the whole place to ourselves, generally.  And about a month ago, we went up to Pittsburgh to visit the family and decided to take in  a Pirates game, and it was sold out.  So, what's wrong with that picture?  Really?  They're all...  The Pirate games sell out like crazy.  I guess there's nothing else to do there.  And they're terrible.  And one of the most merchandised teams are the Pirates that you see, like in music videos  and stuff.  All the people are always having the Pirates clothes on and all that, so...  Hip-hop? 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  But I think it goes back to the 79 Pirates.  We're still living on that dream.  You could either go to a game or watch the steel mills rust.  Yeah.  So, I guess, you know...  Well, we had a caller.  I guess he couldn't wait around.  He said that the tickets for the games are like six bucks.  Is that true, Holly?  Oh, maybe that's why, too.  Yeah, it's very cheap.  And we had like...  Very cheap.  Ten bucks you actually play.  Right.  Which is a lot more fun.  The best part of the whole thing was it was a day after the Penguins won the Stanley Cup  and Sidney Crosby was sitting right above us, so we got a picture of him with the Stanley  Cup. 
[01:51:00]  Cool.  So that was the highlight.  Cool.  But the game sucked.  And it was throwbacks, and I didn't even have announcers.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah, it was like throwbacks.  That's pretty harsh.  I mean, I had the old pajama baseball uniforms on.  By the way, a lot of people...  All right.  All right, Holly.  Enough about...  We don't need to know the...  We need to hold this info about the Pirates.  And then in 1922...  Quick, the parking situation.  Let's get to it.  Jimmy, it was Ray Knight, not Hojo.  Oh, Ray Knight. 
[01:51:30]  Okay.  Oh, Ray Knight.  I didn't know that, by the way.  A lot of people...  Third base, right?  Pirates are...  Yeah.  Revenue sharing?  What's that about?  Revenue sharing is when teams like the Yankees, who have high payrolls, have to give money  to this collective account.  All right.  That happened.  That teams like the Marlins and the Pirates...  It's however high over a certain amount of money you go.  Yes.  And so smaller market teams...  It keeps them competitive.  Yeah.  Like the Royals could never compete financially against New York or Los Angeles, because simply 
[01:52:00]  it's Kansas City doesn't have the money that New York or L.A., you know.  John W. from Hoboken.  Florida went from worst to first to worst.  Yeah.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  That was the biggest dismantling.  That's a good one.  Mike, you got anything else on the revenue sharing, or is that it?  That's pretty much it.  Yeah, we did it for you.  Travis is so smart.  Mark, at the Brewers, you know, us in Wisconsin, I mean, the revenue sharing got us one half  a season of CC Sebastia, where you guys get them for 10 years, and that got us to the 
[01:52:30]  playoffs.  Yeah.  That's all we...  And then we have to double.  The Brewers, they're in the National League now, and the American League, we missed them.  I mean, they were such a fun organization.  The Brewers?  Oof.  The Brewers.  Bud Sealeague moved them, because he owns that team, and they weren't competitive in  the American League, so he moved them to a worse division.  That's smart, man, because the National League states...  Sure, when you're the commissioner of baseball, you know.  Yeah.  Someone else...  Fucking no pitchers.  Stop hitting with pitchers.  All right, he's going to bunt. 
[01:53:00]  Fucking shit.  It is really lame.  And these baseball purists, that's real baseball.  Shut up.  These fucking lefty specialists, these animal pitchers, there's no way a pitcher can hit that.  Yeah.  So it's basically, just say you've got eight players hitting, and the pitcher can walk through  the ladder, strike one, strike two, strike three.  Nothing worse than watching, like, a team, two out, they work their way up to get a couple  of men on base, and a fucking pitcher comes up, and you're like...  Very rarely, they bloop one in, or sometimes when you see a pitcher jack one, it's pretty 
[01:53:30]  fun.  Very rare.  But it's so rare, it's just like, oh, here it comes.  Easy out.  He awkwardly tries to bunt.  Yeah.  Get rid of the bunt in baseball, unless you can make it cool still.  Some of the guys can make a bunt look cool, but the pitchers can't.  They just stand right in front of the plate with the bat in front of them.  There was a pretty cool bunt play in last night's game, where a guy was out, but it  looked like he was going to make it.  And they made a really good play.  I just, I enjoy watching baseball. 
[01:54:00]  I know you don't think it's that fun to watch.  I like doing something else, though, while I'm watching.  It's not like a game you've got to sit there and really pay attention to every fucking...  Yeah, I like doing something else.  We all know what you like doing.  Fawking, stalking, eating, drinking.  Checking a few websites out.  Drinking, yeah.  You know.  A few websites.  Sure.  No, you're right.  Baseball is great when it's on in the background.  Yeah.  It's not my number one sport to watch.  Then you hear like...  What do you got, footer?  Give me a look.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, Wade brought this up.  I'm disgusted by one thing. 
[01:54:30]  The biggest loser franchise, and the biggest problem probably is they need to start trimming  the fat.  It's the Erocs.  They're just disgusting.  Excuse me?  Hold on, man.  I got something for you.  He goes.  Hold on.  I got something for you.  Wait, wait, wait.  Like, um, like, um, I just, like, um, I was like, um, I was like, um, like, um, I was  on, like, um, um, like, um, I was on, just on, like, um, like, um, I was like, um, I  was like, um, I was like, um, like, um, like, um, it's so like, um, you know, the 
[01:55:00]  Dary to play that again.  You know, the original, the original video, I think it's up to a million views.  Is that something like that?  Really?  It's huge.  Well, by the way, huge, I just have to say it.  Footer bombed.  Like, um, a little bit.  Oh.  A little bit.  Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Scotty.  A little while ago, we talked about, um, the Pirates being one of the best merchandise 
[01:55:30]  teams.  Yeah.  Because the colors are black, gold, and red, which are the colors of the Latin Kings.  Ah, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, gang affiliation.  That's why they're, uh, fairly big in the hip-hop community.  Gang affiliation.  Do the Latin Kings wear Pirate stuff because of the colors?  I don't think so.  Do the Latin Kings wear Pirates, like, like, like gear because of the colors?  There's a lot of gangs that wear sports merchandise because of the colors.  Yeah, black, gold, and red.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know that.  Yep.  Wow.  I love that show.  Yeah.  Gangland on, uh, is that A&E?  How about they let us know what colors we shouldn't be wearing? 
[01:56:00]  You're walking around, you know, in some-  No one's going to bother us.  Some strange city.  You're not walking around that neighborhood.  Some strange city with your sports jersey on.  Yeah.  And then you might get yourself in a little trouble.  I honestly don't think they're going to bother a white guy.  Like, I don't think-  Most places where you walk, if you get on a blue shirt and you're a white guy, they don't  think you're a fucking Crip.  Yeah, they got Bloods and Crips Yankee hats, too, where they look like bandanas, kind of like  a bandana material, and, uh, I was watching, I was watching a fucking gangland show, and  they had a biker gang, and some, uh, fed infiltrated it, but they were talking about 
[01:56:30]  what the bikers would carry around, since they can't just carry weapons, they carry  those huge cop mag lights, because it's legal, he goes, yeah, you break down on the road,  you could, uh, use the light, he goes, and you could hit someone with it, and then  they had a bandana that they would tie around the, uh, uh, the locking part of a big  master lock, and then put the master lock in their back pocket, so now the bandana's  hanging out of their back pocket, and if they get in a jam with somebody, they just 
[01:57:00]  grab it and swing, and you get a fucking master lock in the side of your face.  Wow.  I was like, that is fantastic!  A master lock in a bandana?  Yeah.  It's like, it's, uh, tied.  Yeah.  They lock it, and then tie it around.  Oh.  A big tie thing, and now it's in your pocket, but the bandana's hanging out, so it's easy  access.  You just grab it, and you're already swinging it.  Would that hurt, Jimmy?  Wham!  A lot.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, would that smart.  Right in the teeth? 
[01:57:30]  Great weapon.  The teeth are across the fucking eye socket.  Oh, fuck!  Oh, how that would hurt for just months.  You imagine a strong biker arm swinging a fucking padlock in your eye socket?  Oh, boy, would that hurt.  Oh, fuck!  Let me, uh, more Pittsburgh stuff coming in.  We got Matt in Pittsburgh.  Matt.  Hey, yeah, uh, I just wanted to call.  That, that woman from Florida that I called and said, the Pittsburgh Pirates sell it like  crazy.  She's, she's, she's nuts.  Um, they don't sell out unless there's fireworks night when they have Ariel Speedwagon or some 
[01:58:00]  other band from the 80s playing.  Ariel's nuts over that shit.  And they, they, they never, ever sell out otherwise.  They used to sell for bobbleheads, too.  But since they got rid of all their good players, that doesn't even work.  No one even wants their bobblehead people.  So Pirates fans love their fireworks and Ariel Speedwagon.  When it's Ariel Speedwagon night, it sells out?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, dude, they suck.  That's sad, man.  Riding the storm out, are you?  Are you really riding it out? 
[01:58:30]  How many times did you have to play that?  Oh, too many.  Oh, shit.  Give me a little riding the storm out, Travis, for all the Pirates fans out there.  Jimmy, you like this song?  You ever hear riding the storm out?  I don't, let me hear it.  Like Ariel Speedwagon?  Yeah.  As, uh, Travis, well, it's a big build, so you could, we could do a phone call over the  intro.  John, what do you got?  Travis there.  Oh, he's not?  Oh.  Hey, guys.  Hey, John.  The, uh, the Pittsburgh Pirates got two minor league pitchers, like, from a reality show 
[01:59:00]  in India, where they just, like, pull dudes out of the field who could throw 90 mile  an hour fastballs, and they actually find these guys.  Get the fuck out of here.  Wow.  Yeah, it was in SI last year.  Oh, wait.  Riding the storm out is starting.  I like how their, I like how their page, their webpage is, uh, Pride, Passion, Pittsburgh  Pirates.  Pride and Passion?  Where's the pride?  Yeah.  Or the passion?  Storm out.  Waitin' for the thaw out.  Waitin' for the thaw out. 
[01:59:30]  It's a real, man.  They're riding the storm out.  Yeah.  They got a situation.  All right, can you stop this?  I've played that song a million times on the radio.  Yeah.  That's not the original.  That doesn't sound like it.  Is REO Speedwagon Reed doing all their songs with a new singer?  Are they doing a Journey thing?  Because that didn't sound like, uh...  Who was it?  Cronin?  Yeah, yeah.  Kevin Cronin? 
[02:00:00]  Kevin Cronin?  Didn't sound like him.  Well, according to, uh, to our master computer, that's from the album Riding the Storm Out.  That didn't sound right.  Yeah, REO's singer doesn't sound like that.  What happened?  You broke something.  Travis, you want a live version?  No.  Okay.  No.  No.  Maybe we should just, like, stop it right there.  Cut losses.  Yeah.  I don't think that was Kevin Cronin.  It did sound like it.  I don't know. 
[02:00:30]  Or maybe the live version is the one everyone knows.  Let me hear the live version.  A little piece.  Oh, yeah.  This was the version we had to play.  Really?  Yeah.  We played it live?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, groovy.  You'll be sitting there going, what song is it, man?  Knocking a beach ball around.  Passing the little, the little wine satchel. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, you want a joint?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh.  Fucking A, dude.  It's riding the storm out.  Holy shit.  Oh, my chick went to the bathroom.  She thought she was going to be pissed.  Blowing some guys.  Don't worry.  The song goes on forever.  She'll still catch half of it.  That's Kevin Cronin.  Now that's Kevin Cronin.  Get the fuck out of here with the first version.  On a football side in the rocks in the mountains of winter. 
[02:01:30]  Yes, winter.  What the fuck were you playing, Travis?  Well, I think the guy on line nine actually can answer your question.  Yeah, we might.  We're going to learn something today.  Let's go to Jeff in Florida.  Jeff.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Good, Jeff.  Hey, the first band I ever saw live is REO in 73.  Cronin was actually in the band.  He was on the first record.  And he had a falling out with Gary Ritzrath.  Left the band. 
[02:02:00]  That's when they recorded the studio version of Ride in the Storm Out.  Passed things up.  Came back.  And the live version you just played.  Cronin's on that record.  So, kind of boring.  I'm just an old fart.  No, that's fucking.  You actually.  We wondered something.  You called and answered it.  That has never happened on this show.  Oh, holy shit.  I didn't know that.  I had a prize closet for you.  Wait, who's the guy on the original?  The original?  Some red-headed old fucker with one of those anchorman mustaches. 
[02:02:30]  Some nobody.  I can't remember his name.  My knowledge isn't that good.  I apologize.  All right.  I guess it doesn't matter.  It sounds like he never did anything else after that.  So, no wonder they only play the live version.  Yep.  According to the Wikipedia for Ride in the Storm Out, it was Mike Murphy.  Mike Murphy?  Yeah.  Mike Murphy?  God, there was.  Oh, I learned something, too.  Thank you, boys.  I went to school with a Mike Murphy.  Did he sing for REO Speedwagon?  Wow.  You know, you probably don't remember, but you probably had, like, something on the playlist 
[02:03:00]  that you used to get that said, only play live version.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  God forbid you shake things off.  I played the studio version of that song.  The PD would fucking hotline you.  He used to hit you in the knuckles really hard.  Hit you in a padlock on a fucking bandana.  Why is that?  A bunch of fuckers.  Because it would be.  Because God forbid you hear something a little different on radio.  This is something.  I don't know this.  I'm not used to.  How's 92.3 doing?  What?  Is it still frequency?  I don't even know. 
[02:03:30]  I couldn't tell you.  I was driving down the expressway and saw a sheet, I swear to you, spray-painted with  92.3 now on a fence over the expressway.  Like, I don't know who did that.  Some kind of, like, no billboard.  No, it was a sheet spray-painted over the expressway.  Apparently there's a few of them.  Really?  So that's probably like guerrilla marketing.  Some guerrilla marketing thing like that?  Are they doing some guerrilla marketing? 
[02:04:00]  Like, people are going out of their way.  They're like, I gotta promote this station.  Yeah.  Hackery.  Hackery.  There's not a listener listening to that station that's gonna, like, wreck a bedsheet to promote  that station.  No, it's not worth the bedsheet.  What the fuck?  Hey, shit.  Is that horrendous, Jimmy?  It really is awful.  I'm asking Jimmy a lot of questions today.  It's okay.  I'm agreeing with you.  Correct.  Right in the storm out.  That was him. 
[02:04:30]  Wow.  What a bit of trivia.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  Fucking amazing.  And came in fast, too.  A little listening to this show.  Let's go to Chris and Baldwin.  Chris?  Hey, guys.  Just wanted to let you know that the lock and the sock is a choice weapon for inmates.  Better than the shank.  Better than the mop burner.  That's what they use.  Yeah, the fucking lock will crack your skull right open, huh?  Yeah.  They go to the hospital, they're all fucked up.  They're all fucked up. 
[02:05:00]  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, man.  They're all fucked up.  Damn it.  Damn it.  What's the matter?  Brent S. in Brooklyn.  Hey, Opie, how good are Popeye's biscuits?  Biscuits.  Fucked!  Get us some Popeye biscuits right now.  Are they good?  Are they good?  What are you, a fucking communist?  Of course they're good.  Queer.  What are you looking at?  What are you looking at over there?  Ratings. 
[02:05:30]  What are we looking at?  Arbitron ratings of our old radio station?  Yeah, they're tied for 18th.  They're being beat out by WPAT, which is Spanish Contemporary, and then it's WXRK, which is Pop Contemporary,  and then tied for 18th with WXRK.  What's their number?  W-O-R.  What?  WPAT?  No, our old station.  Oh, the number is 1-8.  The trend is 1-8, 1-8, and 2-1.  That's pretty much what we were doing.  Yeah, I guess, actually, they haven't changed the rest of the station. 
[02:06:00]  It's from 6-8 and 12-8.  No, we were doing way better than a 1-8.  I'm saying the station was up and doing a 1-8.  This is the rest of the station.  This is after 6 a.m., I do believe.  Oh, that was a good move on their part, huh?  Yeah, that's 6 a.m. and after.  Nice, nice.  Sam, what do you got?  You're only in here when you want to start trouble.  No, I just thought we were going to talk about now.  Oh, FM.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you don't have a little inside info?  Of course.  Sam is, wow, he just has his ear to the pavement, his nose to the grindstone. 
[02:06:30]  Your eyes are open.  Always.  Never sleep.  You know a little bit of everything.  Always.  You know how they were doing the commercial-free whatever, 10,000 songs or something in the beginning?  Yes.  They've figured out a brand new way to compete against Z100 and iPods and everything.  Wow.  That's miraculous new thinking kind of.  It's magical.  What is it?  Mondays are commercial-free.  Wow. 
[02:07:00]  So?  Okay.  Okay.  So then what you do is Tuesday through Friday you play all the commercials that you should  have played on Monday.  Yes.  That's pretty much it.  So the rest of the days of the week are commercial loaded.  They're trying to start your work week establishing that you're listening to the station and then  the rest of the week you'll listen to it.  Can we put duty marks on their sheets that are hanging all over the tri-state area?  Skid marks and whatnot.  And cum stains.  Cum stains would be good.  And they have a little yellow in there.  A little yellow. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  A little piss.  They spend the rest of the week reminding you that Monday is the only day to listen.  It's the only day to listen.  That's how that works.  And they don't have a host for the morning still, right?  No.  Why would they?  It's just a jukebox.  Fantastic.  What the fuck?  Innovators over there.  Yeah.  Tom in Westchester, PA.  What's up, Tom?  Good morning, bu-bu-bu-boys.  Hi.  Yeah.  We're way ahead of you with the sabotage thing, man.  My girlfriend and I were on the Garden State Parkway by Union. 
[02:08:00]  They had one of those 923 Now sheets up.  Her college is right by there.  So we're so frustrated by the thing.  We just slapped the WOW sticker on it.  We spray painted over the 923 Now, man.  It was great.  It was a good time.  Can we just spray paint sucks a dick across it?  Yeah.  If you see one of the sheets, just put sucks a dick.  And then send the picture in and we'll tweak the shit out of that.  Their promotion department is better.  They were heavily represented at the Pride Parade this year.  Oh, were they?  And we, I mean, K-Rock was never represented at Pride. 
[02:08:30]  Never.  Some little change going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  I tuned out.  They were heavily represented at Pride.  What's Pride?  The Gay Pride Parade.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, back then.  Because the music's a little gay now.  No.  I mean, I guess some of it.  Not most of it.  Jay-Z was doing an interview on there yesterday.  Oh, he was.  With who?  Lisa Page, of course.  Who's Lisa Page?  It was horrendous, the interview. 
[02:09:00]  Was it?  Did we play it?  Yeah.  What was that about it?  I was really frustrated listening to it.  It was like seven minutes long.  And she started out, like, in the interview, she said, you're like my first big guest, so  I'm very excited.  And it's like, oh.  It's really.  She started.  Yeah.  She was, like, asking another question while he was answering the first question.  Yeah, that's the sign of a seasoned veteran.  To the point where he said, you're asking me the questions here, right?  I'm trying to answer. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, he had to actually say that?  Can we hear it?  Can we get a little taste?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll go get some clips.  God, I want to hear some of that.  Absolutely.  And before we go to break, I just got to say, they're filming this Sex and the City movie.  Sex and the City number two.  And I got to tell you, this fucking Samantha is hot.  Okay.  Samantha Jones can still stop traffic, everyone.  Look at the picture.  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook. 
[02:10:00]  She's fucking hot.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Look how hot she is, Ed.  Yeah, huh?  Huh?  She's still got it.  Dude.  Enough with this Sex and the fucking City.  These dumb broads that go to see this fucking shit.  They're filming all over New York.  They're all over Manhattan.  I mean, everywhere.  And Samantha stopped traffic yesterday for one of her scenes.  Oh, she's stopping traffic, let me tell you.  Oh, you think they're going to show a worker on the sidewalk dropping his coffee because 
[02:10:30]  he just can't handle the hotness?  Oh, they're still so sassy, those girls, and sexy.  And they're just, you know, girls about the city, Ope.  They're just there in New York City just having a good time still.  She's 53.  She's 10 years older than the rest of the cast.  Yeah.  The rest of them are around 44, 43, somewhere around there.  She was in Porky's, for fuck's sake.  She wasn't even hot in Porky's.  She has square tits.  She had the worst tits in Porky's. 
[02:11:00]  The worst.  Her tits are square, thank you.  She's fucking hot, though.  Kim Cattrall.  You're not going to see Sex and the City when it comes out?  You couldn't fucking drag me there.  The first movie, first of all, I never watched the show itself.  That ding, ding, ding, ding, music would come on.  I'd lunge for the remote, screaming.  How about this?  We all do a little homework assignment. 
[02:11:30]  We all go and watch the Sex and the City movie and come in with a review.  I already know what it's about, so it's not going to count.  How about we suck dicks and come in with a review?  It would be the same thing.  Well, those ideas don't have to be mutually exclusive.  Oh, there it is.  When I hear this music, oh, Sex and the City's on.  Oh, man.  I think Samantha's going to talk about all the guys she banged in this movie, too. 
[02:12:00]  They'll start the movie out with the girls all together, maybe,  and just talking about what they've been up to.  And Samantha is just going to talk about how many miles a cock has been through her ass.  She's going to be wiping cum off her mouth as they're trying to have lunch.  Oh, I forgot to wipe my mouth.  That's from last night.  Oh, I got a gargle to come out of my throat with this Cosmo.  Wait a minute, gals. 
[02:12:30]  They're empowering.  Yes.  The Sex and the City girls are empowering.  They show that girls can be sexy, too.  Women can be sexy and just, you know, have a power like that.  Oh, they walk around the city and just, oh, look, I'm fucking.  Meanwhile, they hate each other in real life.  Yeah.  Just doing it for the money.  Yeah.  Money, money, money.  So there you go.  It's in our paper, though.  The other paper.  My asshole prolapsed last night. 
[02:13:00]  It's fantastic.  I'm wearing a skirt, and it looks like an elephant trunk hanging down on my ankles.  I tried lifting a safe over my head, and my took has hit the floor.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Is that real?  That's got to me.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, look up.  That's how red your asshole is when it pops out?  I don't even want to say that.  Come on.  Wait, I'll show you another one.  It looks like cherry.  I'll get Danny goes, wait, I'll show you another good one.  Bob Kelly's outside.  I need to get them walking. 
[02:13:30]  It looks like a delicious piece of cherry candy.  Yeah, it probably is.  It's the color of a cherry jolly rancher.  Yeah, a little jolly rancher.  Except you're not.  It should be called a not-so-jolly rancher.  When you have that, you're not feeling particularly jolly.  No, you're not.  A joyless rancher.  Cranky rancher.  Well, you want to get Bobby in here?  Yeah.  Bobby's been out there for a while.  You know, there's no mistaking a video clip called, Oops, My Asshole Fell Out. 
[02:14:00]  I know.  That pretty much tells it.  You don't have to go, what is this about?  Hey, I'm being reminded that from Booger Couch in Arkansas, speaking of cougars,  Courtney Cox will be starring in a new show called Cougar Town this fall.  The difference is that I saw some of the shots of her from that, and she looks really good.  Come on, dude.  She looks really good.  Punch up those pics.  I gotta find her.  Yeah.  Fuck.  All right.  She looks pretty fucking good.  She isn't near as old as fucking that hag.  Samantha.  Jennifer Aniston still looks really good. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Really good.  She's 40 now.  Love Happens.  That's a movie I gotta see.  Are you feeling all right?  Jimmy, take his temperature, will you?  I'd like to take it the old-fashioned way.  Please.  Here's the Courtney Cox in a bra and panty.  See?  From Cougar Town.  Dude, come on, right?  Yeah.  She's looking pretty good.  Absolutely.  Punch up another one.  Full size.  There you go.  Anyone will do.  Look at that.  See?  Look at that. 
[02:15:00]  Not bad.  A good.  A good.  What?  Sex and the City.  Come on.  The excitement is building it.  That.  You guys want to watch Oops, My Asshole Fell Out?  Yeah.  Hold on.  We're going to do that for Bobby.  Hold on.  I'm here with the music playing.  We're going to do it in a second with Bobby, but I don't want to lose John in Connecticut.  Oops, My Asshole Fell Out.  John?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  This morning, I had to walk around the city for a fucking half hour at 5.30 because the 
[02:15:30]  cops decided to move my car because of the filming of that fucking movie.  Yeah.  I don't know if this happens in your city, but here in New York, they could just move  your car, and they don't tell you where it is.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That happened to me once during the Columbus Day, the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Yeah.  I lived pretty close to the parade route at the time, and they just moved my car.  But they don't even leave a sign in the area like you could find it here.  You have to just search the entire neighborhood until you find your fucking car.  They move it like that?  I thought maybe they towed it and brought it down to the docks.  No, because you didn't do anything wrong.  But they need the cars out of there. 
[02:16:00]  So, actually, they needed to move my car because a big wig and the fire department need a prime spot.  So, would you walk around Manhattan tooting your little thing on your keychain?  No joke, man.  I found my car about three blocks away.  Yeah.  But it took forever.  Mine was only a block away, but the cops told me to go up and down New York Avenue and just 10 blocks for no reason.  Meanwhile, it's parked right around the corner, and he had no idea it was right there.  And here's what's fun about that.  You leave your apartment to go look for your car, and you feel like someone stole your car. 
[02:16:30]  Someone stole it, yeah.  So, you got that feeling for a while.  Yeah.  And then you start freaking out, and then you figure it out, wait, someone moved my car somewhere.  You realize it was because Samantha had to walk across the street.  Yeah.  Showing off her gams.  Yeah.  Her sexiness.  A gust of wind blows up like the old Marilyn Monroe thing, but it's her labia lips flapping next to her.  It sends her flying like those fucking little ski things that get pulled in the ocean.  You know what I mean?  All right, listen.  Yes, I know. 
[02:17:00]  Sailboat.  I've got one.  A parasail.  A parasail.  She's parasailing on her vag lips.  We're going to go to Richard in Texas, because now we're sort of talking about cougars.  Samantha Jones.  Courtney Cox.  All right.  Yeah.  This one I'm going to argue, though, with Richard.  Richard.  I'm not buying this.  Can you guys hear me all right?  Yes, Richard.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hi, everybody.  First time I actually get on here, but the other night I was watching TV telling O'Brien,  and Sandra Bullock was on there.  She's not too bad looking. 
[02:17:30]  I heard O'Brien say she was.  Ah, plastic face.  She's got a plastic face.  I'm not digging her.  I never did.  I never dug her.  She's got a weird kind of body.  It's all right, but...  And she's got, like, a guy's chin.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not...  Wow.  Sorry, Richard.  Sorry, sorry.  I'm just not feeling it.  There might be other guys out there feeling it, but I'm not.  Sandra Bullock?  Sandra Bullock.  It's all right.  Yeah, it's like...  At least I had a rewind button on that deal.  You'd throw her one, I guess, you know. 
[02:18:00]  Sure.  Just for the fact that she's Sandra Bullock.  Jeff in Virginia.  Jeff.  Later, Jeff.  Hey, boys.  Let me preface this story by saying that I take my two-year-old to school every day,  and I usually try to turn you guys on for a couple of seconds, and that usually lasts  for about ten seconds before I have to turn it off.  But this morning, I had it on, turned it off, dropped him off.  He turns three in two weeks, and my wife has already received a call from the preschool  teacher this morning because he decided in his own little three-year-old voice to say 
[02:18:30]  co-fucking-cane in school this morning.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  So.  Co-fucking-cane!  Oh, the little kid.  It must have been adorable.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  At least he didn't say this.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  It's only good.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  I like that song.  I got to piss badly. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, we're losing you?  Dude, I got to tickle.  But what about Bobby seeing the video real fast?  We'll do it right now, Jimmy.  Oh, God.  Let me do it after the break.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  You want me to hold your weenie like a little hose?  I'll kink it like a hose when you've got to change the nozzle.  I'm sorry.  I have to make.  I'll fold your weenie in half and hold it.  Jimmy's got a wee.  I have to make.  You got a makey in your pants?  I make wet.  I have to make wet.  You make wet it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have to make wet.  Where's Bobby?  Where's Bobby?  Bobby.  Fucking degenerate. 
[02:19:30]  He's talking.  He's probably.  Look, he's boring fucking Kenny.  How does he do that?  Hi.  Hi, Bobby.  Bob.  Hi, Bob.  How you doing there?  We're going to break, but we want to just show you something.  I know there's fucking something disgusting you want to throw up with so you can fucking  fill your YouTube page.  Wow.  You're real smart.  Fucking look at this.  You're on to us.  We got outside yelling, X-stree, X-stree.  Read all about it.  That's right.  Right.  Hi, guys. 
[02:20:00]  Selling newspapers with the Enola Gay on it for you.  All right.  Just take a look at this video.  Go ahead.  Where is it?  What are you listening to?  Oh, right here?  Yeah, that's right.  That's just fucking in the ass.  That's nice, right?  What is that?  Go off.  What comes off?  What are you talking about?  What came out of her asshole?  Nothing came off.  Nothing.  Look closely.  Watch.  What is it?  Is that an ass?  Is that like me?  That's her actual asshole popping out.  Look, her asshole came out.  Look, watch.  Look. 
[02:20:30]  Is that a rubber?  No, no, no.  That's what it looks like.  Her asshole fell out.  It's called a prolapsing asshole.  Does that happen to assholes?  Isn't it amazing how red it looks, Bobby?  Did it ever happen to you?  I can't take it.  Look at it.  It just goes bloop.  And her whole asshole comes out.  It's just an oopsie.  What happens is if it's hit hard enough inside, 
[02:21:00]  the intestines and stuff push it out.  It kind of collapses out.  Yeah.  But he can push it right back in.  Yeah, your asshole.  It's the intestine.  Yeah, look again, Bobby.  So now that you understand what happens,  you should look at it.  The cock actually pulls it out.  Yeah, look at it again.  Look at it again now that you know what happens.  See?  Oh!  It fell out.  See?  Her asshole fell right out.  But then she pushes it back in.  So no harm, no foul.  Poor Bobby.  He's in here for fucking 20 seconds.  Why would you fucking... 
[02:21:30]  What?  We're trying to educate.  Bob, you're listening to music is a...  All right.  I get it.  I get it, Dan.  I'm trying to stop the music.  I get it.  I get it.  I got it.  All right.  All right.  Fucking you done, Scorsese?  Yeah, I'm done.  Fuck you.  I ain't going fly fishing now.  Yes, you are.  You're fucking coming.  We're going to use that asshole as a fly.  Catch a monster trout with that fucking red ass.  God.  We're going to talk about fly fishing next.  Can I have a water, dude?  Fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  We just want to show you that.  Yeah.  We're just sharing with you. 
[02:22:00]  We're all going to the bathroom and peeing now.  Why?  We just wanted to share, Bobby.  We all checked it out.  Can that happen?  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  What is that?  Surprise.  Bubble yum.  What happens?  You just push it back in.  Bubble yum.  Get a hold of yourself.  Bobby's crying.  Oh, it looks like got your nose.  I got your nose.  I got your asshole.  It's like one of those stress dolls.  You just sit down.  That's what happens if you get a hug too tight. 
[02:22:30]  That's what happens when Pop Pop's real happy to see you.  He gives you a hug.  And I hug you so hard your asshole comes out.  Let me say hi to Mike in Tampa.  Mike.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Good evening.  I can't drink.  Yes, you mentioned Sandra Bullock's got a guy's chin.  Well, Jimmy, I'd appreciate this.  He's got a guy's Adam's apple, too.  There you go.  Yes.  She's got some kind of Adam's apple thing going on.  I never thought.  A little masculine about her.  Sandra Bullock. 
[02:23:00]  Hands like bunches of bananas.  Bullock.  Whatever.  Sandra Bullock.  Very good, Mike.  He's a masculine Bullock.  All right, let's take a break.  You know, when you was a boy, Robert, I used to hug you so hard, your little backside  would prolapse.  Prolapse?  Yeah.  I had to push it back in with my fingers.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, fucking ghoul.  God, boy.  You are a ghoul.  I'd have to push it back in.  It'd be like when all the little snakes come out of the can.  Push it in before funny. 
[02:23:30]  Push it back in.  Look what they're doing on the news.  No, they're not playing fucking rock band.  The anchors are playing the Beatles rock band.  I hope they're playing the John and George part.  Oh, they give you a, well, give you, you buy a guitar that looks like, um, looks like  Paul's.  Only it's righty.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Wow, that's a little rough.  That's a big prolapsed asshole.  What the fuck is that?  That can't possibly be real.  Looks like a pink beehive. 
[02:24:00]  It's a guy's asshole, too.  Oh, it's a guy's ass.  It looks, it doesn't, exactly what it looks like, a fleshy pink beehive.  It's a large African gentleman, uh, with his ass showing right into the camera, and  it is pulled out a good eight inches to a foot.  I can't really tell.  Oh, that can't be real.  No, unfortunately it is.  You could fuck that still.  Would you suck on that?  It looks easy.  Oh, god damn, suck on.  For like a thousand dollars, cash.  Really?  Could you handle, could you handle maggots for a thousand dollars? 
[02:24:30]  One thousand dollars.  And you don't have to pay the government.  Could you handle, wait, could you handle a video of a guy with maggots in his nose?  No, I just don't like asshole stuff.  Okay, yeah.  I don't like that.  It looks like fucking saltwater taffy being made.  That's real.  That's how it looks.  It's so red.  It's very red.  The inside of your asshole?  That's why you get AIDS.  The pussy's nice, though.  Look at that.  That's why you get AIDS?  Yeah, because it's like, there's all blood in there.  After you've pounded it till the fucking asshole falls out, of course it's gonna be red. 
[02:25:00]  What do you think?  That one's not nearly as bad.  That's nothing.  That's bad.  Look how wet the towel is with all kinds of crap and shit and...  Who has a camera at that moment?  It looks like a candy apple.  God, it does.  Bite into it.  You're right.  There's stuff on the towel.  It looks like fucking blood.  Blood and shit.  And like, yeah.  It's on the towel.  You wouldn't sink your teeth into that, Pavel?  Oh.  I just want... 
[02:25:30]  How do you...  Who goes...  Wait, wait, wait.  Go get the camera.  Get the camera.  Hurry up.  Take a picture.  Oh, God damn.  Well, you intentionally shoot your asshole out?  You can do that?  No.  Well...  I can't, but she can.  People with special powers.  I'd love to be awesome.  Oh, God.  Look, it's dripping.  Oh.  What the fuck, Bobby?  Oh, shit.  Bobby.  Why?  Oh, God.  It never gets old.  I don't understand why he has to puke.  There's just something about Bobby throwing up. 
[02:26:00]  I mean, it's disgusting and all that, but...  I can't fucking deal.  All right, we'll take a break and...  Yeah, let's go wee-wee.  And Bobby's going to join the program officially.  Oh, God damn it.  Where are you going to be, Bobby?  We'll figure it out after the break.  Opie and Anthony, Robert Kelly, Bob Kelly in studio, September 10th, Comedy Connection  in Providence, Rhode Island, September 11th and 12th.  September 10th, that's tomorrow, right, Bobby?  Yeah, tomorrow.  All right, tomorrow, Providence, Rhode Island, Comedy Connection.  And then...  I'm sorry, I haven't... 
[02:26:30]  No worries.  It's Friday and Saturday, the Wilbur Theater in Boston, Mass.  Bob Kelly.  Yeah, Saturday night.  Friday, I'm doing a benefit for some big cop thing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  Some big cop thing.  That's...  They didn't give me any information, but I know the cop's going to be there.  The district attorney's going to be there.  I hope it's one of those things where they, like, tell someone they want a TV set, and  they just invite them down to arrest them, and you have warrants or something.  I love that gig.  Yeah, do a gig.  Bob, you said the cop, the district attorney, who thinks he's going to make some big connections  in Boston. 
[02:27:00]  You know what, dude?  Sometimes you make some connections.  No, no.  You make friends.  I'm actually...  I'm actually going to...  I'm going to bomb on this fucking thing.  Really?  This is going to be terrible.  Why?  Cops have a sense of humor?  The singer is...  Yeah, but fucking...  Like a Justin Volpe.  It's all the...  If it was all cops...  All right.  Why?  He did.  Terrible.  Yes.  It's all the bigwig cops, too.  If it was all cops, I'd be fine, because they'd be hammered just yelling shit at me.  Yeah.  I could deal with that.  But now, when I agreed to do it, that's what it was.  Now it's going to be the bigwig cops are coming. 
[02:27:30]  And their family, though.  And their wives.  And some kids are coming, which is great.  That's always great.  Well, you'll be terrific.  Yeah.  And then there's a singer that's going to be there, and she's the main act.  I forget her name.  How long are you going to do?  Wait, wait.  Who's the main act?  Well, I keep dwindling this guy down.  It was 20 minutes, and then 20 minutes, and then it went down to 14 and 14.  Now I got him down to 7 and 7.  Wait, 7?  7 minutes.  Yeah, he's like, just go out and do 7 minutes.  But he keeps telling, you know, you can clean it up a little bit.  He keeps throwing that at the end.  I'm like, I can't.  Oh, shit. 
[02:28:00]  I'm not.  I can't.  I can not swear as much.  Wait, you got to do only 7 or 2 sets?  I got to do 2 sets.  1, before and after who?  I got to go out in the beginning, open it up.  You know, those fucking things.  You got to open it up.  Hey, how you doing?  But he, this is what happened, is that, you know when you're backstage, you're fucking busting  balls, hanging out?  You know, people sometimes see that and go, yeah, do what you do.  Oh, do that.  No, it's not the act.  No, it is.  You just go up there, you break some balls.  Hey, where'd you get that shirt?  Just go up, have some fun, you make some fun, you do it, and then you're done. 
[02:28:30]  What?  No, no.  You clean it up a little.  Clean it up a little.  How do you go into something like that knowing, like, this fucking is going to suck a dick?  Every cell in my body has anxiety for the last couple days.  I hope your asshole pops out in the middle of your act.  But out of your throat.  I hope you're talking and your asshole and tongue prolaps together.  You'll do all right, Bobby.  Yeah, I'm sure it's going to be fantastic. 
[02:29:00]  It's just, it's going to be.  The last time I did one of these was an Indian wedding.  Really?  Downtown.  It was a million dollar wedding.  What kind of Indian?  And they went to the cellar.  Obviously.  Some people went to the cellar and was like, oh, we should, you'd be good.  This is a million dollar wedding.  And they offer you so much money and you're like, I can't, you can't say no.  I know.  And then you went down.  It's just a bunch of people in series and dots in their head.  Oh, you did one of those?  Dude, it was, it was so bad.  Did you bomb?  So bad.  So bad.  So bad. 
[02:29:30]  It was, the only people that were laughing were the waiters and waitresses.  At you.  At me.  How much time?  Well, you know what?  The Indian people probably wanted to worship you.  Wow, he gets one in.  Because it was back then.  That's a great one.  Yes.  So you had to, imagine seeing Christ just tell dick jokes at a party.  Like, what the fuck?  You got nothing for that one, Bobby.  Oh, that was a fantastic one.  And I've been listening to it too.  Jimmy's on fire since he's been back. 
[02:30:00]  He's got a lot of pent up fucking craziness.  He certainly does.  Then he leaves for another week, starting to watch.  So you did that, how much time do you have to do?  I'm fast.  I'm fast.  I can listen to gig stories, bad gig stories.  Dude, the worst gig story I ever did was, you know, Matt Frost.  But wait, the Indian people, how long time do you have to do?  And you bombed terribly?  20 minutes.  And I did the full 20.  I would not stop.  As I felt, like, beads of sweat, slow motion, cranking down my forehead into my, into my,  my eyebrows wouldn't even stop the sweat.  Yeah, it just kept going. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, just.  What did they do when your set was over?  Smiled.  Didn't they say sorry?  Did they politely clap or anything or?  No.  No.  You just kind of walked off?  No.  I said, all right, well, you know, sometimes, I think I said, sometimes you win, sometimes  you lose.  Oh.  What's nice advice at a wedding?  Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you listen to those stories, Jimmy, and like, put yourself  in the situation?  But it's like, it's almost like, with comments, it's like, I so know what that is.  I've done those, never that Indian wedding, but I've done enough gigs where it was just, 
[02:31:00]  I bombed or I socked and it's fun to hear because I so understand it.  I don't want to, I asked him how the Dane Cook gigs were.  Ah, good, it was big.  End of story.  I'm done.  Who cares?  Yeah, yeah.  Tell me about how you bombed at the Indian wedding.  I have four hours to kill, you know, what stories?  Those are the ones you want to hear.  How the fuck are you?  Matt Frost booked me a gig up in upstate New York.  It was a black gig, a black show.  And I guess, whatever, everybody's doing it.  So I take the train up to this gig.  I get off the train and the guy meets me. 
[02:31:30]  He's, he's like a big, big, huge black guy with a big gold medallion and a big truck  with bass pumping out of it.  And I get in and he has a bucket of, of chicken.  No way.  Because the comics that do the show love the chicken.  Uh-huh.  So he's like, yo, man, I got you chicken, man.  Most people like the chicken.  They eat in the car?  They eat a bucket of chicken.  He hands me a bucket of chicken.  He lets guys eat greasy chicken in his car?  Of course.  So then he, but he's, he's a legitimate pimp too. 
[02:32:00]  Like I start talking to people.  He's a legitimate pimp and a drug dealer.  And they bring me to the hotel.  So I'm sitting in New York, upstate New York, brings me to the hotel.  A guy knocks on my door and goes, yo, what's up?  And he walks in and he lays money out in the bed and he goes, count it.  And it was like 2,500 bucks, 2,500 bucks.  Back then it was fucking crazy.  That's a lot of money.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  Cash.  And he goes, count it.  I go, I trust you.  He goes, count it.  And I was like, okay, I'll count it. 
[02:32:30]  So I counted.  The guy picks me up, brings me to the club.  It looks like an, honestly, it looks like an abandoned, like a mechanic shop.  It's just a big brick cement building with, you know, stuff painted on it that's scraped  off over years.  And, and then you go inside, it's this gorgeous nightclub.  It's an underground nightclub, all black people.  And the poster is black guy, black guy, black guy, me, black guy, black guy, black guy.  So it's just me in the center popping out on this photo.  Wait, no, all the comedians that are performing.  No, I'm headlining. 
[02:33:00]  I'm headlining.  Wow.  So I go in and I, the, the, the MC on the show is a local comedian that knows everybody  and everybody's a cousin too.  I don't know if black people, you know, it was my cousin.  This is my cousin.  This is my cousin.  The NC.  Huh?  Nothing.  Jesus Christ.  I didn't get it.  All right.  The, so everybody's related somehow.  And then they, the, the MC hated me.  Oh, hates me. 
[02:33:30]  I knew Jimmy had to get it eventually.  Why do you hate you?  Because he wanted the headline.  He want, they would never give him a shot at the headline.  Of course.  They would only let him NC.  Why is this fucking white guy the headline?  And here, yeah, exactly.  Here I am.  I'm up there headline.  He's pissed.  So he brings, he goes up and does every, yo, check out Laquisha's hair.  Yo.  He knows everybody.  So he cracks on everybody and just smashes everybody and he kills.  Then he brings me up.  Well, are there other comedians on the show?  No.  It's him and me.  Oh, you too.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  And a room full of 200 black people. 
[02:34:00]  That he knows.  At an underground nightclub.  Nobody knows I'm there.  Nobody knows where it is.  Are they sitting or are they standing?  They're sitting and standing.  Okay.  They're all over the place.  I go up, I don't know, a minute and a half into my set, nothing.  When two minutes, nothing.  You know you're about to bomb.  What joke tells you, your opening joke tells you this is going to be a problem?  When I go, hey, you know.  And did you put Velcro on the ceiling?  An empty boat. 
[02:34:30]  No, I'm just saying, you know.  So, dude, it was bad.  The first joke bombed.  First joke, nothing.  Second, nothing.  And then I started going, haha, well, it didn't work, huh?  And I start like, then I start, what happened?  I was going and going and going and trying, nothing.  Then somebody yelled some shit out.  This gangster Tupac with a wife beater and chains.  Just shredded.  Has like, you know, 17 abs.  You know what I mean?  His pants are pulled down.  He's just got a cock ab. 
[02:35:00]  He stands up and says, fuck you, motherfucker, some shit.  And I just snap with every hack.  Yeah, you have to.  Whatever you find.  I don't fucking knock the broom out of your foot.  The cock's out of your mouth, you fucking.  Yeah.  I go into it.  You should have went Michael Richards on him.  Yeah, that's fucking.  I actually get him.  People start laughing, right?  People start laughing at what I'm saying.  He snaps.  He's coming to kill me.  They have to grab him.  Holy shit.  He's running towards the stage.  The big guys, the pimp and his other pimp and his other, all these guys grab him. 
[02:35:30]  These big motherfuckers grab him and drag him out of the club.  Jesus.  So now I don't even know if he's waiting for me.  Yeah.  Okay.  So now I go back into jokes.  Nothing.  You needed that motherfucker.  I try to go back into fucking with the crowd.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I have to walk off with nothing.  Let me ask you, how much time are you supposed to do?  An hour?  I was supposed to do a fucking hour.  45 minutes.  How long did you do?  I did maybe with that, maybe 30 minutes. 
[02:36:00]  Maybe.  Maybe.  That's a long time.  Maybe.  That must have seemed like a fucking hour.  It seemed like a fight.  You know when you get into a fight and you don't know what happened?  How long it was?  I don't know.  Who started it?  You're like, he started it.  How long have I been out?  Was he the only one who heckled you though?  Was everybody else okay?  This gets worse.  Dude, that's not the end.  I get off.  Okay?  The MC goes back up.  And kills.  Now he's mad.  Because it's like, this motherfucker.  Just killed the crowd.  He goes up and starts trashing me.  He takes the opportunity to let everybody know without getting his fucking, without getting 
[02:36:30]  fucked up.  That you should be letting me, mother.  This is my house.  He pulls that shit.  This is my house.  This motherfucker, white boy, come on.  Fuck this motherfucker.  It starts cracking on me.  So they're laughing.  They're laughing at his cracks on me.  I'm standing by the bar.  No microphone.  He's trashing me.  You can't do anything.  You're done.  It's not even over yet.  Now a big mopey motherfucker comes up to me.  Big fucking lurch motherfucker. 
[02:37:00]  He comes up.  He, he's just, he has a microphone.  He goes, yo man, you got to go up there.  Defend yourself.  Now I have to get into a battle.  Why?  A joke battle.  And I'm like, no, it's cool, man.  He can just trash me.  It's all right.  I'm, I'm, he's like, no, man.  He's like, you got to go up there, man.  You got to do the right thing.  You got to go up there.  Grabs me by the neck, like not violently, but just enough to know that he's not fucking  around with a microphone.  And he pushes, he's pushing me up to the stage.  I got to go joke to joke with this guy. 
[02:37:30]  This guy, this guy, he starts flipping out because he doesn't, he doesn't know who I,  he doesn't know if I can trash him.  He doesn't want to take the chance.  He starts going, fuck that man.  This is my house.  Fuck him.  Fuck that.  Don't bring him up here, man.  That's fucked up.  Fuck, fuck him.  This is my house.  I let this mother.  He didn't know if you're going to embarrass him or not.  He didn't know if I'd fucking get a couple of good ones out and make him look like an  asshole.  So he didn't want me to fuck up there.  So he's like, fuck.  He starts yelling at the big guy because they're cousins and fucking Jesus.  So now I'm fucking, I'm sitting there. 
[02:38:00]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucking petrified.  I got a mic in my hand.  This guy's yelling at this guy.  This guy's got his hand on the back of my neck.  The whole crowd's looking at me and then it's just anticlimactic.  He's like, fuck that.  Hit the music.  And they hit the music.  It turns into a nightclub.  It's better off that way.  No, it's not because they wouldn't take me home.  Why?  I had to sit there for two and a half hours in the nightclub.  During the time where it's now a dance club.  Cause I'm supposed to kill, I'm supposed to kill fucking slay this place and then walk 
[02:38:30]  around and get accolades and a bunch of fucking black pussy and get my dick sucked and fucking  do cocaine and eat chicken wings and shit for the rest of the night.  That's what was supposed to happen.  But I wasn't supposed to, you know, be, get the fuck out of there.  I'm sitting there.  People are coming up.  Some girls were nice to me.  You know, it's okay, baby.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  People looking at me.  Ooh, you got, ooh, you got so fucking destroyed.  Ooh.  It's all right, baby.  You're all right.  You're kind of cute.  You know, that type of shit, which is all right.  I'm, but I'm petrified cause people, some guys will walk in by me like they're going  to kill me. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  And then finally I go to the, the, the big guy.  I go, is there any way I could get a ride back to the hotel?  And this is the guy who just paid me 2,500 cash to do this disaster.  And he's like, he's like, he's not even talking.  He's like, yeah, motherfucker.  Hang on.  And he grabs his little cousin who's like fucking 12 and hands him the keys to his  truck.  Yeah.  So he drives, he's got to drive you back to the hotel.  So now I got to, I'm paranoid.  This guy's waiting for me to kill me.  So I literally run out to the car and jump in, slam to do a locket. 
[02:39:30]  Let's go.  Let's go.  Drives me back to the hotel.  I take all the money.  I put it in my socks, my asshole, my balls.  I just roll it up and I fucking take it.  I took a cab to the trade station at like a four in the morning, four, four.  Three in the morning.  I sat there until seven.  Cause you're afraid they might come back for the money.  I hid it like behind a Coke machine, like outside.  Yeah.  I was like, they're going to come and fucking take my money back.  Why wouldn't you?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  So, so the thing was, uh, who was the comedian that did that? 
[02:40:00]  The guy that held with, how many years ago is this?  Dude, I don't even know.  This is years ago.  This is when I, this is when I first came to New York and this happened with me and  you one time too.  I bombed in front of you up at Delhi.  Yes.  You know, you do good and you kill and you, you know, you get a little cocky.  I didn't trash you though on stage.  No, you're cushy.  Then you're my friend.  You fucking asshole.  Yeah.  I remember when he bombed.  Oh, it was Heather.  Heather and her friend came to see us.  Dude.  I, well, the thing was, I did that school as a middler and I headlined there once and  I killed every time.  And it's like, kind of like a black school.  SUNY Delhi.  It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a predominantly, not predominantly, but it's like say 60% black, 
[02:40:30]  which would be predominantly audience.  And for some reason I had always done well there as a headliner.  Like I've never really, I've never, I don't, I'm not saying I get HBO special things there,  but I don't bomb there for some reason.  And I don't know why.  Yeah.  I, I didn't bomb there either.  And I actually was headlining there twice and it was great.  And I went in all cocky because I've seen guys, guys bomb there.  Guys go there to die.  Everyone bombs there.  Everybody.  Jesus.  So I went with him and I'm like, Oh, it's a great show.  I'm going to go up.  He's going to go up. 
[02:41:00]  I'm fine.  I'm going to kill it.  I went up and I said something to some black girl joking around, but it came out fucking  weird.  Oh no.  I was just kidding.  Yeah.  But it was, I was kidding.  Yeah.  That doesn't cut it.  And I, I was fucking just nose diving.  Yeah.  Just fun to watch.  And I'm trying to pull up.  Cause Marty, the guy who books it doesn't give a shit.  He doesn't care if you bomb.  Careless.  Oh, he's the greatest guy ever.  He doesn't give a shit.  If he likes you, he's going to book you.  Even if you fucking take a hot one every time he, he likes.  Now who at that, that black club, who booked you like, and did you shoot them? 
[02:41:30]  It was my, it was my agent.  And the guy probably saw him in the club somewhere and goes, Hey, I like that guy.  Yeah.  He, you don't go to your agent after that and just go, what the fuck?  He offered me $2,500 to do a black club.  He gave me all the details.  I'm such a cocky asshole that I think I can just rock the house anywhere.  Hey, fucking $2,500 cash is a lot of money too.  Fucking asshole I am.  I deserved it.  See, you should have, I need to learn the fucking word. 
[02:42:00]  No, I don't know that.  I just want to fucking please everybody.  Fucking asshole I am.  Too bad you can't remember who that comedian was.  So if you ever like, you know, his name, I wouldn't even fuck with him though.  He's absolutely right.  No, his name was Chris Rock.  No, he was.  He wasn't right to shit.  Imagine it's just some mega superstar now.  Joe in Virginia.  Joe.  Uh, yeah, I was wondering, if you boys ever hear of Grandma Lee?  Yes, I know her.  I do.  You actually know Grandma Lee, Jimmy? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, she was in, um.  I'm bothered by her.  I'll explain in a second.  When I did Last Comic, I flew to Tampa because I wasn't available for the New York qualifier  because I was doing a gig.  I wasn't going to cancel.  All right.  So Grandma Lee was on that show, yes.  Was she on Last Comic Standing for a little while?  I don't.  She was the season I was on, season two.  I'm bothered by her.  Uh, she's, I think, 75 years old, grandma, getting into comedy late in her life.  Yeah.  She's on America's Got Talent, which is a massive show.  And she's in the finals.  Oh, cool.  And, uh, her stuff's all right. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  It's just all right.  But the problem is that the winner is going to get a million dollar contract with Vegas.  Oh, wow.  And you guys would blow Grandma Lee away on your worst day.  And we know comedians, and it's amazing that they're giving her this primetime spot on  this huge show because there's guys that are way better that deserve a million dollar  contract with Vegas.  Oh, good for her.  I mean, she's blowing up, and she's, yeah, she's doing well.  So, yes, I know it's perfect, though.  She does street jokes that supposedly she writes herself, and it's all clean TV stuff. 
[02:43:30]  I mean, she's, it's kind of gimmicky, but you know what?  That'd be great.  She'd be killing Vegas.  You know what I mean?  Guys like Cookie Jar make it.  Danny Gann's a huge in Vegas.  I don't want to look.  Why not some of you guys getting that contract?  Dude, Vegas is, like, the end of the road.  Yeah, but it's a nice spot to go for a little while.  Fucking pot of gold at the end of that road.  Yeah, man.  If you get Vegas, absolutely.  I mean, if you could do it, but you think about it, you're doing, you're doing two shows  a night.  Yeah.  But you can go out there and do, like, Dice Ray's did time out, Bill. 
[02:44:00]  Like, he'd go out there and say four or five weekends a year, which is great to have  your calendar, four or five nice money weekends a year, and then go out the rest.  And that's a great gig to have.  Full-time, no.  You're working two shows, maybe one to two shows a night every week.  You don't get a week off.  No.  And then you get Monday.  Monday's black.  That's in the business.  You think it's a miserable existence?  Oh, okay.  Miserable existence?  No, it's not a miserable.  If you're done, you know what I mean?  If you, like, forget it, I'm done.  It's not like you get to go, you know, audition for a film on Wednesday. 
[02:44:30]  You're in Vegas.  You have an 8 o'clock and a 10 o'clock.  You have to do.  There's Grandma Lee on our screen there.  She was nice.  Oh, stop.  Yeah, I don't mean a trash.  I don't really mean a trash, but I'm just saying, I mean, that's a big spot for a lot  of guys.  A lot of guys would love that spot.  That's her back in 1920?  Yeah.  Jesus.  She's kind of hot.  Whoa.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  She looks the same.  Time is a bitch.  Do we have any audio of her?  I'd like to see her.  She performed one time.  It was right before he died.  Well, the sob story before she hits the stage. 
[02:45:00]  Look at the fucking Jay Leno promo floating in the corner.  When I was raising my kids because it was a full-time job for me.  Nice fucking jowls there, you bulldog.  Not good for her, I guess.  Now this is just me.  Yeah, she's an old lady telling jokes.  Hey, give her.  Yeah.  Right here.  Fucking mongoloid hairdo.  Yeah, her haircut is nice.  And then Moe Howard.  Got a lady dye haircut for people that linger longer with us. 
[02:45:30]  Here's Grandma Lee.  Want a taste or what?  For Grandma Lee.  Where's she from?  Santa.  Mesopotamia.  Yes, she is.  Very old.  All right, we get it.  This guy's dancing around her.  Oh, shirtless.  Why are we buffering today?  Why is everything so slow today, Danny?  Do we know?  Slow every day.  It's just...  Kept the crap. 
[02:46:00]  I know you want my body.  No, we don't.  Doesn't everybody?  No.  Form a line.  No way.  Behind Piers in the hole.  No way.  We just got it.  What'd she say?  I don't know.  Behind hop?  You know, I love this country.  But President Obama, honey, your stimulus package ain't gonna work.  I was married to my ex-husband for almost 40 years.  And believe you me, not the combined efforts of Playboy Channel, Victoria's Secrets, or the 
[02:46:30]  soothing, seductive music of Barry White, some packages that cannot be stimulated.  I want to see her teeth fly out of her fucking head.  They love her, though.  Yeah, but she's almost tripping there.  She's on the brink of tripping over everything.  She's pretty...  I got divorced because of religion.  He thought he was God.  I did not.  They're just laughing at her because she's old.  Stop.  It's like a several palsy comic. 
[02:47:00]  Dwayne is from the hills of Kentucky, and his family is cock-tree.  His kinfolks make Kevin Skinner's kinfolks look like the trumps.  Who's Kevin Skinner?  Another contestant.  Matter of fact, Dwayne's daddy, Pooter, flunked out a chicken catcher school.  That's inside stuff.  I want to see her vagina just fall out.  By applause, how many ladies out there are married?  Flap it.  Flap it up now.  Because another 40 years or so, you're going to be like me. 
[02:47:30]  With the love of your life standing at the foot of your bed,  with a box of X-Flex in one hand, a bottle of Viagra in the other.  Thinking they were coming or going, Joe.  Trying to make a conscientious decision.  That's a good line.  That's a great line.  I don't care about that.  That's a good line.  I don't like that.  And to my ex-husband, Dwayne, if you're out there watching,  and I know you are,  this is for you,  and this is for America. 
[02:48:00]  Show your tits.  After all these weeks of pranking around with peers.  Sorry.  She should have went the distance.  She's wearing...  Boxers.  British flag boxers.  But she's also wearing, like,  pajama bottom leggings.  What'd you say?  Finally got in your shorts.  Yes.  God bless America.  Can't get madder.  God save me.  Even if she has success. 
[02:48:30]  It's not that we're getting mad at her.  This is being seen by, what, 20 million people?  I don't know.  And there's a lot of comedians that are way better,  deserve a spot like that.  How long is her career going to last?  Exactly.  Eight months?  You know what?  I should find out about her.  I'll ask Sharon tomorrow night.  Who?  Oh, oh, oh.  Because you'll be seeing Sharon Osbourne.  Where are you seeing Sharon?  Aussie tribute.  Oh, yeah.  That's a silly Aussie tribute.  Where is it?  Oh, silly.  House of Blues in L.A.  Yeah, it's just a little thing.  Is it being filmed? 
[02:49:00]  I don't know.  Who else is there?  Just little names, right?  I don't know who's going to be.  The tribute itself?  Yeah, who's doing it?  This guy, I forget, this guy from Camp Freddy,  the band, is hosting it.  It's myself.  Guitar Slash, uh, yeah, Henry Rollins,  and fucking Billy Bob Thornton.  Those are big guys.  Oh, Billy Bob Thornton.  Those are big guys.  Yeah, Billy Bob Thornton.  Yeah, Aussie will be there.  You know how it is.  Coral.  I hope he rubs your head and goes,  poor little feller.  So do I. 
[02:49:30]  Your dead little brother.  Are you and me both?  I'd let Billy Bob put me in a shoebox.  Nuts and bolts and whatnot.  Make sure you make some voicemails  while you're out there, Jimmy.  Oh, I will be pleased.  Of course I will.  We're going to follow your trip  with your voicemails.  Hey, Sam cut up the Jay-Z interview.  He says it's so worth it.  It's only two minutes of audio.  You want to do it or what?  Yeah, I want to hear this.  We brought it to everyone's attention,  I guess Jay-Z was on our old radio station,  which is now a pop station.  Oh, by the way, quickly,  just so we don't have to revisit this, 
[02:50:00]  that old lady thing there.  I don't like any comedians  that have a gimmick  that makes people laugh  just because of the gimmick,  whether it's a disease  or fucking age or whatever.  She got laughs.  If you took some young broad  and she was telling those jokes,  you'd be sitting there going,  ugh, shut up.  She's old and telling us.  I do agree with you.  Jimmy's got a soft spot for her.  I hate that.  What am I, competing with her for anything?  No, I just don't want to.  It's like she doesn't deserve to be there. 
[02:50:30]  I don't mind.  She's fun to watch.  She makes people feel good  because they're like,  ah, the old.  It makes people feel like,  hey, look,  you can still go out  and follow a dream.  Look, she's doing it.  Because I'm telling you,  people feel fucking...  You're just, ugh,  following a dream.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm fine with you.  But I'm saying people fucking,  people feel defeated after a while.  And they're like,  hey, little lady.  Well, they should be.  I'm just saying,  but that's what they want to say.  You reach a certain point in life.  It's called defeat. 
[02:51:00]  You're lost.  Life wins.  I want to see Grandma Lee doing porn.  Death comes and fucking,  with the sickle.  What happened to you, Anthony?  It's over, Johnny.  You used to have a dream.  I'm cynical.  You used to have a nice dream.  I have a dream.  Sure I did.  Then the Russians came and ended it.  Hey, we got Bill Burr on the line.  We're going to have to...  What?  The Jay-Z thing is going to have to  wait for a second or two here.  Mr. Burr, how are you?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Bill.  We got Bob Kelly in studio  and Jim Norton,  just so you know  who you're playing with today. 
[02:51:30]  Bobby!  Billy!  Hey, buddy.  We missed the Bill Burr.  Hasn't been around for a while.  Aren't you coming back  to do some New York comedy festival stuff?  Yeah, I'm doing that in November.  November 6th, I think I am.  But this week,  I'm whoring myself out  down at the Helium Comedy Club  in Philadelphia.  That's a great little club  down there in Philly.  Very nice.  They know their comedy in Philly.  I'm sitting in my hybrid, Anthony,  right now in the garage  because it's only 6.30 in the morning. 
[02:52:00]  Really?  And I don't want to wake up  my neighbors with my cursing.  But I have a coyote  that is in the fucking backyard  so I had to come down  and I have a little stick with me  just in case it comes out.  A stick versus a coyote.  Actually, they're pretty scared.  You should get a fucking padlock  with a sock.  Yeah, like the prisoners.  I hear coyotes are very aggressive, actually.  Not only are they hungry.  They're one of the animals  that are really aggressive.  They're hungry.  There's a different look  in the eye of a wild animal  because they're only like 
[02:52:30]  the size of a medium-sized dog.  But they have this look on their face  that if you want to throw down,  they have no problem doing it.  Yeah, they look kind of like dogs  but it's that thing in the eye  where it's like,  alright, this thing is not domesticated.  Yeah, no, they come down  out of the hills  this time of the year  and basically they eat little dogs.  Eat little dogs.  I think Ozzy lost one of his dogs  to a coyote recently.  Yes, he did.  I will give my condolences tomorrow  when I sleep.  I know you will, Johnny.  I'm sorry.  And you should.  I heard that the other night. 
[02:53:00]  I was laying in bed.  It was one of the creepiest nights  of sleep I ever had.  I just heard this woman's voice.  She was walking up the street  like calling her dog.  It was some weird little dog name  like Tiki.  Oh, poor Tiki.  It's the scene in Jaws.  Yeah.  And it was just like echoing  throughout my neighborhood.  And then she got about a block  and a half away  and I just heard this  blood-curdling scream.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, I was laying in bed  like terrified.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:53:30]  Fucking.  God, it killed her dog.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  I was just picturing  she found it like half beaten  with like the leash  way in there or some shit.  Wow, that's fucked up, man.  That's pretty close.  That's why I got the pit bull.  Yeah, yeah.  How's the pit bull doing?  Oh, she's fucking great.  Yeah.  I'm like every owner of a pit bull.  I think she's awesome  because she loves me,  but she doesn't like guys.  That's what I realized.  I love that 
[02:54:00]  when you go over  to somebody's house  and they're like,  yeah, she doesn't really like men.  And you're like,  well, you know,  what am I supposed to do?  Put your hand out  very slowly  and let him smell your head.  Great.  I'm a fucking, yeah.  There's a chance  this is going to go real bad.  This is all based on instinct  right now.  Yeah, great.  I'm betting my life  on a little piece  of a fucking dog brain.  That the DNA is just right.  Yeah.  It doesn't bite your hand.  You know what the worst part is?  The worst part is  people always have 
[02:54:30]  sort of a nervousness  around a dog like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Which makes the dog nervous  and it just feeds off of itself.  Like the person's like,  is this dog cool?  What's with the dog?  And then the dog  starts being like,  dude, what the fuck  is with this guy?  Yeah.  Why is this guy nervous?  It can sense,  it can smell fear on you,  so don't be afraid.  Oh, great.  I'm petrified, you fuck.  I got one of the good ones.  I'm sticking with that.  I know it's going to end  in a lawsuit.  It'll probably eat a little dog  or bite my neighbor. 
[02:55:00]  What is it like?  Does it fuck your place up  or does it eat your shit?  It did have separation anxiety  because it was left by a river.  But we kind of got over that.  We just sort of blockaded in  with couches  and now it's okay.  How old, Bill?  How old did he got it?  Oh, I have no fucking idea.  I have no idea  what this dog has done.  That's the thing  about rescuing a dog.  Oh, a rescue dog.  You have no idea.  Oh, good.  You don't know  what the trigger word is.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[02:55:30]  You can just say it.  Yeah, basically, yeah,  like it's a Vietnam vet.  I don't know if it was,  you know,  peeling potatoes  or if it was in the DMV.  I have no idea what it is.  In the shit.  Yeah.  I don't know.  She has nightmares  every once in a while.  I don't know.  You know,  you're not supposed  to wake a person.  I wasn't going to fuck  with a pit bull,  but it's a great dog.  Where does it sleep?  Oh, at least  at the foot of the bed.  I don't do that shit  where it like eats off my plate 
[02:56:00]  and lays in my bed.  It's a fucking animal.  It's on the floor  where it belongs.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  I don't like the whole thing  of people sleeping on the,  or a dog sleeping on the bed  and getting all fucking,  what is it?  Does it get hair everywhere?  I just,  I woke up twice  with my dog on the bed.  It's assholes in the house.  It's asshole in my face.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Dog is telling the same story.  Yeah, Bobby's dog  is all over you. 
[02:56:30]  He's got little cute ones, though.  His dog,  I know,  they're very loving.  Bill, you know your dog  is going to end up  in bed with you.  They all end up in the bed.  I don't know.  I've had it for like four months.  Yeah, so far so good.  Yeah, but I can see that.  Any accidents?  Any accidents?  Yeah, on the carpet,  you know.  Oh, yeah,  I had an accident.  I did get a car  the other day,  but it's all right.  I hate that.  You're not going to have  a pit bull on the bed, though,  because it's like  got a regular-sized cock.  You know what I mean? 
[02:57:00]  I didn't even know that.  My dogs have like  little things.  Like a pit bull  has like a fucking  cock and balls.  It's a female, Bobby.  Oh, all right.  Well, he's got a fucking  huge vagina  that you want to fuck.  Well, let's see about that.  Did you get her off  Santa Monica Boulevard?  You never know.  T.E.  You wake up,  you sleep-eating pussy.  I don't know where  that place is out here, too.  What's that?  Oh, of course.  I love how you know 
[02:57:30]  where that section  is out here, too.  Dude, we filmed  Lucky Louie off Los Palmos.  Los Palmos is called  or Los Palmos,  whatever the fuck it is.  Hollywood Center Studios,  which is right in the heart  of Tranny Town  off Santa Monica.  There's a tranny park?  Yeah, the heart of it is  they got this area  on Santa Monica.  Like, they got this  donut shop.  It's called  Yum Yum Donuts.  Yep.  And it's like  all the fucking  like pimps  and drug addicts  and transvestites.  I don't even know  if they're transvestites.  They all look like  women to me there, Jimmy.  It's all Kruller Donuts. 
[02:58:00]  That's all they serve.  Yeah, they boo  the munchkins.  Boo.  They just put  two of them  with the Kruller.  You can suck on them.  I'm 87.  Hey, Bill,  how about the fires  out there?  Are you safe?  Were you safe  from the fires?  Oh, yeah.  It's just a...  They always exaggerate  those things.  Well, did you have  your family call you?  Because Jimmy was out there  during the fires 
[02:58:30]  and his mom was very concerned  and called Jimmy  to make sure he was safe.  No, no.  My parents...  They don't give a shit.  They don't fight.  No, it's just a part  of the nature out here.  It's just that  they make it seem  like a tragedy,  but it just...  It's been going on forever  and these idiots  build fucking houses  up in the hills.  Yeah.  It's not a tragedy.  There's too many  fucking people  and I say let it burn.  Let it burn. 
[02:59:00]  Bill's the anarchist.  Kind of like an anarchist.  Let it burn.  Yeah.  All right, Bill,  so it's the Helium Comedy Club  this weekend  starting tomorrow, right?  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to be at  and I haven't hit you  with any creepy conspiracy theories,  so go to...  I think it's Ted.com.  You guys seen  that robot dog yet?  No.  No.  They got this...  They call it a robot dog.  Wait, is it really Ted.com?  That's my website, William!  You're stealing Ted's website,  Bill Burr.  I think it's that. 
[02:59:30]  I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  I'm sitting in my car  in the garage.  I have no idea what it is,  but just search like robot dog.  They got this...  Look, it's got the body  of a turtle  with like deer legs.  All right,  so what's the problem  with the robot dog?  Why can't we just  enjoy a robot dog?  You can kick it  and it stands up?  Yes.  Yeah, I've seen  that motherfucking thing.  The fucking thing is running.  Remember the old days  if you kicked a robot  and it tipped over?  Yeah.  That was the end?  Yeah, this thing knows  like it has equilibrium  and shit.  Yeah, we're stupid.  We should at least  still make our robots  where if you kick them over  they don't get back up. 
[03:00:00]  I think Bill Burr is right.  Look, it looks like  a fucking...  What is this?  That's a dog?  That's a robot dog?  That's a robot.  Dude, this guy  kicks it as hard  as he can  and not only  does it not step over  it does what  a human being would do  where it gets knocked  sideways  but kind of regains  its balance  and keeps going.  That thing is so fucking...  If you saw that thing  coming through the woods  at you  I would just drop dead.  Do you know that  a hundred years from now  they're going to be  watching this  the way we watch  fucking Wright Brothers footage  and going 
[03:00:30]  look at these  idiotic robots  how clumsy they were.  Holy shit, look at this.  You should get one of these.  Look at this guy.  That's how big it is?  Look, look, it regains  its composure.  I would feel guilty  doing that.  It's as big as a pony.  Yeah, but look  the thing about it is  you know  all you had to do  back in the day  is just trip them  and it was over.  I don't give a  robot cop any of them.  You're just not...  I would love to see  the fucking thing  get pissed off  that the guy kicked it  and turn around  and come running after him.  Why does it have hairy legs? 
[03:01:00]  Make them metal.  Make them metal.  I don't want  fucking hairy legs.  I'm frightened  about the robot.  I don't want to  pet the robot.  You can't fucking  believe the shit  that they're doing.  I saw in 60 minutes  that they have  this one computer  that it's learning  how to read  the human brain.  Great.  Wow.  And it's like little things  like if you think  like paper cup  that the computer's  like paper cup.  It's become aware.  Oh shit,  it's on the ice. 
[03:01:30]  Holy shit.  It's not falling down  on the ice.  It looks like  Anthony walking  up the steps.  With Danny  right behind me.  I know.  He's got four legs.  Yes, you two  carrying a keg  with your fucking  drunken heads.  Oh shit.  It looks like  two guys with a box  on its heads, right?  Dude, this is so  fucked up on the ice.  It actually is able  to...  What's the URL  for everybody else?  People got to check  this out.  That's amazing.  If you just YouTube  robot dog, 
[03:02:00]  it's the first thing.  All right, good.  You got to check  this out for yourself.  There's a couple  of funny YouTube videos  making fun of that  type of shit.  But yeah,  they're coming up  with these computers  and they're going  to be able to  read your mind.  So they were  asking the person,  so what are you  going to use this for?  And the guy's  trying to play it off  going like,  oh, you know,  if you leave your house  and your daughter  has a party  and you ask her  and she said  that she didn't,  you could just  hook her up  to this machine  and find out.  And they just  keep asking,  going, really?  That's why  you're going  to spend a billion dollars? 
[03:02:30]  And then finally  they just break down  and it's like,  well, you know,  we found out  that torture  doesn't work.  Yeah.  We have to read  minds now.  This is all  good stuff,  even though it's  going to be used  for shitty stuff.  I'm telling you,  the whole planet  is going to be  a planetary unit  and we're all  going to be  connected to the  same consciousness  eventually.  Computers are a  part of our evolution.  I can't wait.  That'll be fun.  We'll be long dead.  The fucking Borg.  I think that's  the direction  it's going to go.  I don't see it  in a good way.  I see it's all 
[03:03:00]  microchipped and  the second you think,  you know,  fuck the Fuhrer,  they're going to have  a robot.  Fuck the Fuhrer.  I think we're going  to be beyond that  after a certain point  though over like,  hey, who's in charge?  I think eventually  that type of hierarchy  shit  in a thousand years  or two thousand years  is going to be  very different.  Holy shit,  the thing's jumping.  The thing jumped  over some fuhrer.  What the fuck?  It's really cool.  And how bad  do you want one of those?  Walk around the compound.  I actually have one.  It's in my yard.  It's walking around.  Can you buy these things yet? 
[03:03:30]  Swim to my pool.  No, this thing  is so under research.  Yeah.  The military will have them  long before we do.  Yeah.  Yeah, you send  that fucking thing in.  That looks like  two fucking guys.  It sure does.  That's weird.  You send that fucking thing  into a building  with some guns  and cameras on it.  Fuck letting our soldiers  get fucked up.  That's what I'm going to do.  You guys want to see  a good YouTube video.  I'm always throwing  those out there.  Search girl gets answer  very wrong.  Girl gets answer 
[03:04:00]  very wrong.  Okay, where Danny  is punching that up  now as we speak.  Yeah, when you get in here,  we'll talk about this  new United Nations thing  wants a new global currency  to replace the dollar.  Exactly what you were  talking about.  A while ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, that whole  are they even  they're probably  going to go right  past the Amero.  I don't know, man.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Pretty scary.  That conspiracy theory  shit is not  necessarily just theory.  And it said  from the shit  that says there's  a guy living  in the moon. 
[03:04:30]  Danny, what do you got?  From that shit.  Yeah.  Danny's popping in here.  Oh, yeah.  Actually, I pulled this  for you guys some time ago.  I don't think we ever  got to it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's a pretty funny clip.  All right, let's pop this on.  When we refer to someone  as yellow,  we consider them  to be what?  Chinese?  Not Chinese.  Over to Jerry and Murray.  No.  Yes, Jerry.  Um, Cowardly.  Cowardly is correct.  Oh, shit.  The Chinese kid. 
[03:05:00]  How great is that?  I didn't even see that  Chinese kid was there  until after she had  the wrong answer.  When we refer to someone  as yellow,  we consider them  to be what?  Chinese?  Not Chinese.  Over to Jerry and Murray.  No.  Yes, Jerry.  Um, Cowardly.  Cowardly is correct.  Oh, the poor little  Asian boy  answered it right  after the girl  just fucking dissed them.  Fucking Harligan  from the UK.  Fucking gooks.  Chinese? 
[03:05:30]  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking great, man.  All right, Bill.  We're going to catch up  with you when you come  to the comedy festival.  Get back here.  Yeah, please.  All right, guys.  Thanks for having me.  I'll see you soon.  All right, Mr. Burr.  There goes Bill Burr.  He's going to be at  the Helium Comedy Club  starting tomorrow night  through the weekend.  I was bumming Billy  couldn't make it  to the comic party.  Well, he lives in L.A.  I know.  Should have flown in for it.  Have one when he's  back in town.  Yeah, now the fucking  weather stinks.  You got a heated pool.  Yeah, but you know, 
[03:06:00]  don't close that thing.  The whole thing is,  oh, yeah,  when it starts getting  zero degrees out.  Fuck yeah.  There's nothing better  than swimming in the snow.  The thing looked like.  How great is that?  It's the best thing  I've ever did.  Swim in a heated pool  in the snow.  No, I know.  It's great.  You've got a corporation.  You've got those outdoor pools  that are heated like Anthos.  No, I was at a Renaissance Inn  in Kansas City  when I was doing the improv.  Oh, and they had  an outdoor pool that they're  Yeah, it went from indoors  to outdoors  and it was a blizzard.  Oh, see.  That's fun, right?  It was one of the best  things I ever did.  Especially being bald, too.  You have my steaming fat head. 
[03:06:30]  Quick break.  More with Bob Kelly  and the Jay-Z interview.  There's still lots to do today.  Opie and Anthony.  Come on, Bobby.  Give us a little something.  I know.  We'll wait for the  La, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  Fly fishing sucks.  On the Teddy Mountain Highway  Bless you. 
[03:07:00]  Driving along  Teddy Mountain Highway  Wow.  I sing in my song  Jimmy in the back  Eddie in the front  Opie at the wheel  And we ain't gonna stop  On the Teddy Mountain Highway  I kind of like it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jimmy's fronting.  I want to see Jimmy do better. 
[03:07:30]  Do you want to try it, Jimmy?  Do you want to try it, Jimmy?  Yeah.  All right, start it over.  Start the fucking riff over.  Bobby not doing a bad job there.  It's pretty good.  The Teddy Mountain Highway?  Yeah, it wasn't bad.  I kind of like it.  All right, Jimmy's gonna  knock it out of the park here.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Hey, Bobby,  why don't you eat  cum out of my hand?  Come on.  Eat some cum out of my hand.  Fucking bugs me  if you say that, dude.  Come on.  Come on. 
[03:08:00]  Come on, cum eater.  Cum eater.  That's what fucking aggravates me.  I don't know why that bugs me.  Cum eater.  You cum eater.  No, you cum eater.  Come on.  It bugs me.  Close him over like a pooch.  Come on.  Like a pooch.  I'll make you a cum sickle.  Jimmy's leaving us  in a couple minutes here  for LA.  What?  You're leaving?  Got to get ready  for the Aussie tribute  and a little show  called Jay Leno.  Fuck, you're going to have  a hell of a week.  Yeah, it's a good week.  But before you leave, Jimmy,  what's your take on Bobby 
[03:08:30]  insisting that I go  fly fishing with him?  I think it's great.  I hope somebody throws  a toaster in the lake.  I was explaining  because I haven't seen  Jimmy in a while.  I was explaining the big  what is it called?  The Bobby,  the Bob and Greg  fly fishing extravaganza  you're calling it?  Yeah, the match  in the hatch weekend.  The match in the hatch weekend.  Match in the hatch.  Yeah.  We got to match the hatch.  To match the hatch?  No.  That's if like  I was walking around  and I found something  like you on the ground.  I would try. 
[03:09:00]  What do you mean?  I don't know what you mean.  Sometimes you win,  sometimes you lose.  What are you saying?  You look on the rocks,  you find the bugs  what the fish are eating.  So you got to find  what the fish are eating.  So if there's certain  types of bugs  that the fish are eating,  you then got to replicate  that with a little fishing  fly.  Like fly.  Or you could not do that.  Right.  Yes.  And do anything else.  Do I have to make  my own fucking hatch?  No, you don't.  Yeah, you got to make  your own fucking lure.  It's just so stupid. 
[03:09:30]  No, you don't make.  Is J.W. Trout  going to make ours?  I don't know.  I haven't called them yet  because I might go  with another company  that lives right in Roscoe.  Oh, shit.  I don't know if we're going to.  I don't know if.  I can't wait  until you fucking  go to step on a rock  with your rubber boots  and you slip  and your fucking bone  comes to the skin.  Nice compound fracture  in a cold lake.  You're absolutely right.  I almost slipped  a couple times  and it almost hit my head  on a fucking  170-year-old stone.  You know how great  I'd love for the  fucking park ranger  to find him  face down in the water 
[03:10:00]  and just pull his  fucking bloated butt in.  Look at the monster  trying to hula hoop today.  She's trying to hula hoop.  Oh, Christ.  She is a monster.  Wendy Williams.  Bobby, I didn't get  my hotel room yet.  And we're a couple weeks out.  It's going to be sold out.  They don't know.  It probably is sold out.  Why is it going to be sold out?  Fucking pedophiles  and serial killers.  Yeah, exactly.  Where they put  witness protection people.  We know you're sold out  of murder.  You're going to be living  in Roscoe now  teaching fly fishing.  Bobby, how about you  book me a room for me? 
[03:10:30]  What do you mean  book you the room?  I'll give you the money  when I get up there.  I don't feel like  calling Roscoe for a room today.  I gave you all the information.  You just call him.  I deleted the email.  I'll fucking resend it.  I still have it.  I'll send it right now.  Do I really have to go?  Here.  I just picture this.  I just picture Greg Hughes  was quoted as saying  we thought it was  a doll at first.  Like in the water  that they find bodies.  That's what happens up there.  Yeah, don't bring your dogs.  People go up there  to bring dead people.  No, because your dog  is going to find  the dead bodies 
[03:11:00]  that Anthony's talking about.  Don't bring your dogs.  I don't want to be involved  in a murder mystery.  Maybe I'll try  the fly fishing thing.  There's no shopping, Bobby.  Everyone's calling me  the last few days.  There's nothing  for girls to do up there.  87 is right there.  The fucking Woodbury Commons.  What do you mean nothing?  How far?  20 minutes.  It's more than 20 minutes.  45.  It's an hour.  It's an hour.  No, it's not.  It's an hour and a half  back to New York.  Who's going to spit 
[03:11:30]  in whose hand?  Me, me.  Like from Back Mountain.  Me.  Believe me.  That's going to be fucking...  Here's what's going to happen.  Everybody's staring in the water  looking straight ahead.  You fucking jerk  into your hand.  You come in your hand  while the other guy's fishing  and you hold it up  and you go...  Go ahead.  Oh, God.  Bobby, they're saying  the rooms are sold out  for our weekend,  so it's a big convention up there.  There's no convention.  There is.  There's nothing up there. 
[03:12:00]  There's one motel,  a serial killer motel.  Yeah.  A motel.  You know the fucking light  comes in in the morning  until you probably  can't sleep late?  Why do you have to get up early?  They don't have curtains?  What time are we getting up?  Not good ones.  What time are we getting up?  Well, not good for you.  You have to...  You have a vampire.  I like to sleep late.  Thank you, Danny.  Ross, go to the Woodbury Commons  where the girls  are supposed to shop  while we're flying fishing.  That's if you drive this...  That's an hour.  That's if you take that road.  That's an hour.  You take the Woodbury...  Take that road.  What are you supposed to take?  Take the Woodbury Commons road.  He doesn't want the girls  to shop. 
[03:12:30]  He wants the girls  to come with fucking baskets  on a boat  like on Golden Pond.  He thinks he'll be like  fucking Norman and Billy fishing  and they're going to come out  on a boat.  Brought you some sandwiches.  It's not going to happen.  Going to catch Walter?  Yeah, exactly.  You're not catching Walter.  When are you going?  Are we really going?  Are you booked?  Listen.  You're booked.  I'm booked.  I got my outfit.  I got my vest.  Outfit.  I got my...  I actually made a device.  We're going to need a snowcat  to get a...  What kind of device?  Hopefully the same one  Carradine made. 
[03:13:00]  They have an angler shop  right here in New York,  you know.  Right on 5th Avenue,  25th.  I'm sure it's real cheap  to buy fucking angler stuff  on 5th Avenue.  What's an angler?  I like looking through  this thing at you.  Why wouldn't you?  I know.  What's an angler?  I'm not shopping  for anything.  An angler is a fisherman.  I thought J.W. Trout  was setting us up  for everything.  I just have to show up.  Yeah.  You're not an angler.  Are you going to go?  Are you going?  Ew.  Are you going?  That is the key. 
[03:13:30]  Look at me.  Don't look at them.  Be a man.  Be a man.  Be an angler.  Be an angler.  You're not an angler.  I'm trying to read anything.  Jimmy hates that you're an angler.  But you're not an angler.  You're a fishing guy.  You're fish boy.  Hey, fish boy.  Go catch me a trout.  We're going to go.  Bring your buckets.  I would say...  I'd say go.  Just because...  Why don't you go with him?  It's going to...  I don't want the...  You can't shoot fish.  I swear to God.  I would so be blasting into that water.  Fucking redneck and camo.  Like a madman.  Like a madman. 
[03:14:00]  I'd be blasting into the water.  I'd get more fish that way, I bet.  Oh, would you get in Dutch?  No.  I think it was legal up there.  All right, Bobby.  What do I have to do?  Sell it right now, and then I'll give you my answer.  All you have to do...  Do I have to book my own room, or could you do that?  No, I'm not fucking Kenny.  What are you?  Out of your mind?  Grow up.  Then tell Kenny to book the room.  Would you tell him?  I'm not calling Roscoe.  Just tell Kenny.  I'll email Kenny the information.  All right, good.  You're coming.  Good.  What are you going to bring?  A hair dryer up there, you asshole?  Yeah, that's what I do.  I blow dry my hair.  Now I'm reading people are saying Bobby is an... 
[03:14:30]  The only time Bobby's an angler is when he was trying to suck his own cock.  I'd fucking love to deny that, but I almost did snap my own neck.  He's a 45 degree angler.  Maybe even Bobby, you're an angler, because that's what you grab when you're getting fucked.  Why don't we go all in?  I really did.  I slipped...  You know the soap dish in the shower?  Yeah.  I had to use that, and I pushed my...  To suck my own cock, and I pushed my leg up on that, but then it slipped, and both  of my legs went flying down, and I hit the back of my Achilles on the fucking faucet 
[03:15:00]  really hard.  What are you doing in the shower?  Trying to suck my own cock, asshole.  Why don't you just do it in bed?  You can't do that in bed.  Why don't you just do it in Roscoe?  It's more fun than what you're going up there to do.  I'd rather blow myself in a motel shower and fucking fly fish.  You need a hard...  Get a look under the rocks to find bugs, do you?  You need a hard floor.  Why?  Because the bed kind of collapses.  It prolapses.  But it prolapses.  It all collapses.  No, that way...  It's bending your fucking legs fast.  Because you're supposed to use the headboard.  I hope he did the physics. 
[03:15:30]  I was never ever to reach.  I was good at physics.  Fuck you.  You can reach right now, Anthony.  I could never fucking bend that way.  Take it out of your sock and suck on the top of it like that.  Do it right now.  I would be here.  You got a big mule.  I know you do.  Just be fucking jerking.  Yeah.  Go into my own mouth.  J.W. Fisherman is going to have a fucking rifle pointed at Bob's head.  You'd be immune to cum right now.  The taste.  Like nothing to me.  Like caviar.  Fucking unflavored yogurt.  You ever lick your cum off a pair of tits?  What? 
[03:16:00]  What?  No.  You ever lick your own cum off?  No.  We've talked about this before.  I've...  You know...  There's been instances where my tongue may have come in contact with some form of my own  fucking seed on a chick somewhere.  Like a kiss a chick or something?  Yeah, but this is fine.  Norton gets Bellini's and puts it in there and fucking sucks him down.  Oh, that's terrible.  Holy shit.  No, I...  Someone's saying...  They have an arrow pointed themselves saying, no desire to taste your own cum.  It's not a desire to taste your own cum. 
[03:16:30]  It's fucking...  Sometimes it just kind of happens because you're fucking...  Oh, you have a red asshole inside.  What happened?  I just saw the inside of his asshole and it's red.  You looked in that far?  Dude, he opened it that far.  No, he didn't open it up.  In all fairness to Bobby, he did spread his cheeks pretty wide.  I'm not a pirate looking for British ships.  Let's say hi to Dave in Chicago.  Dave.  Hey, uh...  Sam can barely make it out of the damn studio without Bobby trying to molest him.  I know.  It's amazing.  Hey, guys.  What makes you think when Bobby gets you up in the woods, he's not going to try to recreate 
[03:17:00]  deliverance or something?  I hope he's not my type.  Thank you, Bobby.  Yeah, Bob likes twinks.  Yeah, he's got too much hair.  Bob likes a twink.  No offense.  Smooth guy.  He doesn't have much hair, huh?  He'll start growing all my hair back then.  I'll be back when you guys were in Boston.  Oh, probably.  With the long hair and you wear those little skelly caps.  All right, Bobby.  He kind of kisses his neck a little bit.  All right.  Hey, what's up?  Today, we're going to be crazy.  Woo!  Today's going to be nuts.  We're going to fucking do some... 
[03:17:30]  Wow, oops.  Ew, I messed up.  You better beat that.  Wow!  W-A-F, what?  That's how we record our stuff.  Yeah.  You were a hot little twink back then.  I didn't sound like that live.  No.  Our recording devices record everything a little faster.  It was recorded on the tape moving very slow to conserve tape.  I don't know.  Yep.  So when you play it back...  All right, Bobby, so no J.W. Trout, though.  That scares me.  I don't want to do too much shit.  No.  All we're going to do...  If you're going to go...  Right.  If you tell me you're going, I will book the person today. 
[03:18:00]  Why do you want to do this?  I might go with this other company because they provide everything for you.  It's fun for him.  I'm going to do everything.  Yeah, book the fish.  Here's a bucket with fish in it.  Now go home, assholes.  You know what, dude?  You get in touch.  You got nature.  You know what?  Boom.  You got your coffee.  You're out there.  You fish in.  Boom.  You got your coffee.  He tries to paint this really picturesque landscape and it just sounds shittier by the  word.  You know what, dude? 
[03:18:30]  The rain is trickling.  Boom.  The girls are shopping.  Boom.  I like the new boom.  You got your coffee.  That's what I remember.  Yeah.  He's like, you know what, dude?  You got a cup of coffee.  What do I need?  You know what?  You got to slow down.  Smell the flowers.  Yeah.  You know what, dude?  Years ago, people live like this.  You know, you get your cabins.  You grab your sandwich.  Yeah, really?  Really, dude?  It sounds awful.  It sounds awful.  First of all, you like nature.  Well, keep the dogs home.  You're in nature. 
[03:19:00]  I'm allergic to dogs.  No, you're not.  For real, yeah.  Oh, bad.  Oh, the dog hair?  Why should you take a dog, though, where you can't control him and have him in a certain  area?  They're going to be splashing around.  They're going to be all fucking in the lake.  They're scaring the trout.  Then why bring him?  What?  To hang out in a hotel where they're going to watch HBO?  Because I live in Manhattan.  I'm not going to spend $180 to fucking have a babysitter watch my dogs.  How much are you paying the fucking JW guy?  You're going to be in the hotel room.  While the girls are shopping?  No, while they're watching them.  They might go hiking.  Does Lindsay hike? 
[03:19:30]  Danny.  She'll hike, I guess.  Does she hike?  You don't have to bring Lindsay if you don't want to.  If Lindsay wants to stay, she can stay.  But you've got to go.  I just glanced over at Danny's screen, and he's Googled how to suck your own dick.  And his pictures and everything.  Where?  Is there an actual technique?  Yeah, there's a couple of different techniques.  I'm skimming over that for you, you fucking selfish asshole.  What's the normal method?  Sitting down on something.  I couldn't do that.  Jimmy's leaving.  And you have...  Bye, Jimmy.  I'll see you later.  Jimmy, be safe. 
[03:20:00]  Say hi to everybody for me.  Keep us updated with those voicemails.  Oh, Hollywood Jimmy, where are you going?  Jim, I'll see you later.  He put his glasses on.  All right, there he goes.  Hollywood Jimmy.  There's one picture where the guy is just sitting down, and he's grabbing the back of  his knees, kind of, and has his head down, and he's doing it that way.  I couldn't do that.  And then this is the...  That's the one I tried.  This is the one where you're on your bed.  I think most 13-year-old boys have tried that one.  You're on your bed on your back.  You flip your legs over your head, and you use the wall now to walk down. 
[03:20:30]  You're actually walking down the wall to try to walk the dick into your mouth.  And you're using your arms to pull your...  Yeah, yeah.  And you're pushing your ass closer to your face, but...  That cuts off your oxygen.  That closes your trachea.  So you've got to come in your own mouth before you pass out?  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, you've got to be careful with that one.  And is there another one?  There's the guy sitting again.  Oh, that's a weird one.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's a guy that's pretty much got his legs pinned behind his back, like under his arms. 
[03:21:00]  And he's sucking his dick, kind of looking into his asshole.  He's actually sucking his dick and fucking reading his future.  He could look at his prolapsed bunghole.  He's shaking the magic prolapsed asshole.  And then more tips.  Stretch before your session.  Make sure to stretch the muscles in your back and legs.  It avoids pulling muscles and cramping.  Drink plenty of water to keep your muscles hydrated.  It also presents cramping and fatigue.  Make sure your stomach is empty.  Wait an hour or two after you eat. 
[03:21:30]  It's like going to the pool.  Because you're going to fill it with a lot of hot cum.  Right?  It's more comfortable.  Your stomach contents won't get in the way when you double over.  Don't strain yourself.  Stop if you feel pain.  And vary positions to avoid putting so much strain and pressure on the same muscles and parts of your spine.  You should get somebody to try that.  Try to suck his own cock.  Apparently, if you don't succeed on the first try, you keep trying.  If you can't get your mouth over your cock the first time, what does it say? 
[03:22:00]  Oh, don't be disappointed.  Self-sucking doesn't come naturally to everyone.  It can take discipline and practice.  But keep at it.  It's like karate.  You'll become more flexible.  Right?  It's like karate.  I'm a black belt and fucking sucking my own cock.  How's this for a depressing stat?  Some stats say that only 1% of men can self-suck.  But we think that with practice and stretching, most guys should be able to at least make some mouth-to-cock contact.  Even if it's only the tip of the head. 
[03:22:30]  If nothing else, practice self-sucking.  It will make you more flexible and possibly increase your overall well-being.  So take it slow.  Work with what you've got.  And try to have fun.  Is this real?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  By the way, I wasn't reading that.  That was just off the top of my head.  And there you go.  That's your way of life.  Yeah, that's it.  All right, Bobby. 
[03:23:00]  What's up, buddy?  All right, I'll go.  Are you going to go?  Yeah, but just make it easy.  What do you mean, make it easy?  All right, here's a concern we have.  First of all, what are you going to do?  When was the last time you went out with a friend?  Even if he went with you, he still wouldn't be.  That's true.  No, we're kind of becoming friends.  It's obvious to both of us.  Oh, nice cock.  Oh, sorry.  That's what came out.  I guess we're going to see some guy is going to auto-filate himself. 
[03:23:30]  That's easy, though.  Well, the fucking guy's got like a 14-incher.  Yeah, that's fucking easy.  He's got some meat there.  He's a little flexible.  He looks slender and flexible enough.  He's using a one-knee-up technique, right?  Don't romance it.  Oh, he could just kind of lick the tip.  Not very good.  Hang on.  We're not fucking there yet.  No, not very good.  He can't really take that in.  He's just fucking around.  We've seen guys swallow him right to the balls. 
[03:24:00]  He's just...  You can't go right to the stairway to heaven.  You gotta...  No, he's just...  Here he goes.  Would you be happy with that if you could do that, Bobby?  I'd be happy with that cock.  You got what?  Fucking nice piece.  On him, still?  Of your house?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  God, I got a small dick.  Now, while we're watching this guy play with his dick...  What the fuck is this?  He's always concerned about having fun and stuff. 
[03:24:30]  Now, the fly fishing isn't easy.  I know.  I'm looking through bars on a microphone stand.  Get this fucking thing out of it.  No, I like it.  Yeah.  I like it.  It's like fucking Robocop.  Fly fishing is very difficult.  The guy is very successful now, just to get back...  Oh, because now he's using the technique where he's got his legs over his head.  That's a good technique, yeah.  He's not even hard, though.  No, he can...  It's depressing.  It's depressing.  You're going to turn yourself on.  Is there a money shot?  Hopefully not.  There better be, or this was a...  I haven't seen his home before.  There better be, or this is a total waste of time.  Man. 
[03:25:00]  Picture didn't happen.  Yeah, come on, man.  All right.  No.  Yeah, what...  Yeah, like...  You know how hard it is to fucking fly fish?  It's not.  You don't learn it in one day.  I did.  No, you didn't.  I absolutely fucking...  You were able to go...  I caught a fish the first day I went out.  Two fish.  First day.  Am I going to get tangled up?  Yep.  Yeah, the string is...  I don't want to deal with that.  The fishing line is going to get all tangled.  Deal with what?  What do you want?  An assistant to untangle your fucking line?  I don't want any of that.  Okay, GH.  I got it.  I don't want to work too hard.  When you do regular fishing, you don't work that hard. 
[03:25:30]  You cast, you reel it in a little.  Yeah.  Hope you get a bite.  Hope.  Sometimes the fish follows you right into shore.  Hope.  What?  Be an angler.  Be an angler.  See the angler.  I'm going, Bobby.  Be the angler.  Dude, tell your chick...  We spent so much on this on our show, I got to go now.  Now you have to go.  I need a payoff.  You're invested.  Listen, you're going to catch a fish.  It's going to be easy.  Now, do you...  I don't even care if I catch a fish.  I just don't want to...  I just don't want to be untangling line all day, actually. 
[03:26:00]  That's my biggest concern.  Yeah, but just...  You don't tangle it up.  You're just going to be...  How do you...  Without tangle it up?  You don't make that...  How's my technique?  No, that's awful.  For real?  Yeah.  You said 10 and 2.  Don't touch your other arm.  You don't have to hold it up.  Why?  Because it's not a fucking sledgehammer.  I figured this would keep it a little more stable.  No, no, no.  Look at this.  Like this.  Look.  All right.  I'm up.  I'll put the thumb up.  Okay?  Wrist straight.  Straight.  Ready?  Are you talking about blowing yourself a fishing?  Wrist straight.  Grab your cock. 
[03:26:30]  It's the same exact thing.  We've got to get into line of the day.  Bringing it back today.  Listen.  Yes.  Back.  Back.  Like a hammer.  Back.  Forward.  Back.  Like this.  Look.  10 and 2.  No wrist.  No wrist.  It's all in the elbow?  10 and 2.  Right in the elbow.  It's in the rod.  Not in the anything.  It's all in the rod and the line.  Ready?  Look at this.  Like a hammer.  A two-sided hammer.  All right.  I got it.  Right.  Bang.  Stop.  Back.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Wait.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  No, no.  Now go like this. 
[03:27:00]  Ready?  Look at this.  Hey.  Hey.  Let me tell you something, though.  It's the way you're doing that.  There's.  It isn't just that.  There it is.  With the rod in your fucking hand.  No.  You know what?  You could go on a swing, right?  Say you're sitting on a swing.  Such an angry gimme.  And then you go.  I know.  I'm fucking mad at everything.  Let's say you're on a swing.  And you know how you got to swing your legs forward and backwards, forward and backwards?  Yeah.  But you can't just sit there and go forward and backwards.  It's a certain time that you have to now put your legs backwards and forwards.  So you're just going back, forward and backwards. 
[03:27:30]  No, no, no.  That's just.  The line could be going nowhere.  You're on lure.  You're fucking fly, whatever it is, the hook, can be sitting in the water right in front  of you while you're just going back and forth.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  When you do it, the line is so sensitive and the rod is so sensitive.  When you pick that up, I don't care where that fly, it's coming up out of the water.  There's a certain, like, oscillation.  There's a frequency, I believe, that you have to do.  Shut the fuck up.  Stop using big words.  I'm not kidding.  Oscillation.  There's like, yeah, because if you go too fast, the hook isn't going to move. 
[03:28:00]  It's like, it's like swinging on a swing.  Well, you go, yeah, that's what I'm saying.  You go, you know, stop.  So that's a technique you got to learn and practice.  How fucking hard is this?  Go, boom, bang, boom.  He's not understanding me.  I'm going to fucking bash him in the head.  I got it.  You're not.  You love me.  No, you're not.  I'm not going to hurt you.  Bobby, a lot of cute.  But I get it.  Go ahead.  I had a second stepdad that used to fucking talk like that, too.  Go ahead.  Did he?  No, he used to actually hit me.  Aw.  Billy Manchington.  Coke Logic.  Opie needs a safe word.  If he needs Bobby to stop talking so Opie can cool off and have some silence. 
[03:28:30]  What's my safe word?  Home.  I want to go home.  My safe word is home.  I don't like that they think that I'm going to be the fucking yammering idiot on the fucking  river.  It's going to be him going, fuck, he's going to be fucking, Bobby, dude, how do you fucking  tie a blood knot?  I'm going to try to, I'm going to be trying to fish by myself.  He's going to be like, what do I do with this?  How do I do that?  Well, you're supposed to have an expert there.  I do.  That's why.  Yeah.  See, and then you can just fish, have fun.  We want J.W.  What happened to J.W.? 
[03:29:00]  Well, the other.  He's got a lot of promotion from us.  The other guy.  J.W.  He's fucking great.  J.W.  Trout.  It's not J.W.  It's J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  J.W.  I've done a lot of research for the whole thing, so I'll call them today and make sure they  have everything.  I say Opie ends up in a bar with the locals, just down in a few beers.  Actually, a lot of your listeners actually emailed me a bunch of people that are fly fish  and do it professionally and offered to.  So if there's somebody out there, a listener, that wants to, you know, has the waiters and 
[03:29:30]  the boots and shit and all the stuff, there was a guy who actually sells all the stuff.  So you want free rentals is what you want?  We don't need free rentals, Bobby.  We do okay for ourselves.  No, not free rentals.  Let's get some free shit.  Listen.  We could pay for our rentals.  Well, I already got my shit.  I'm not renting anything.  I got the whole gear.  You got to make sure I got my shit.  I know.  I don't feel like going to an angle shop.  All right, but I'm saying that somebody could bring the shit for you.  We could sell angles.  Yeah.  Lots and lots of angles.  What do you need?  I need 90 degrees.  Should we do line of the day? 
[03:30:00]  Bobby, I'm going for real.  Yes.  You're going.  So I'm going to hook you up.  Just make it kind of easy.  I'm going to hook Kenny up.  I'll send it to Kenny.  You're such a fucking, what happened to you?  No, it's not that.  If it's something I really enjoy, I'll go out and do everything.  But it's something I'm like, so I'd rather you make it easy.  Baby, you're not going to be.  For real.  You're going to have a blast.  All right.  You're going to be in a river.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  That sounds fun.  Should we sleep in a tent?  Really?  No.  We're not sleeping in a tent.  Why?  It's nature. 
[03:30:30]  Me and you?  Not me and you.  I'll get my own fucking tent, you weirdo.  You're sleeping in a fucking tent.  You get a one-man tent.  I'm not getting a tent.  Get a tent and a sleeping bag.  I want a fucking sleeping bag.  Let's sleep right next to the stream, man.  No.  I want to fucking watch fucking.  Then we wake up, scratch our balls, and we get some fly fishing going.  No.  Yes.  No.  I want HBO, and I want a fucking bed.  It's not the same with a continental breakfast and free HBO.  Yeah, it is.  We should be in nature already.  I'm not fucking sleeping outside.  We should be in nature already.  Fuck.  I'm scared of the dark in the woods. 
[03:31:00]  It's really coming out now.  I'm not fucking sleeping out with woodsy shit.  Fuck that.  The star lights.  No fucking street lights.  Fuck that.  No way.  I'm going to Guatemala the weekend before, so I might not even make the trip.  I might get killed.  Okay.  Let's do line of the day.  Right.  Thank you.  And then we'll get out of here.  Could you sing us out with that song?  Yeah.  What's the name of that song again?  It's called Teddy Mountain Highway.  All right.  Think of some more lyrics.  Teddy Mountain Highway.  Think of more lyrics, because we might be using this on a regular basis if it's done  right.  Here's your first, I guess, runner-up line of the day. 
[03:31:30]  So your iPod doesn't get overcrowded, right?  You got to take the Beatles you have.  Uh-huh.  Delete them off your computer.  Gone.  And off your iPod, or computer first?  Both.  iPod.  Both.  Then your computer.  Yeah.  Then you put them on your computer, and you sync up your iPod.  And then you put your iPhone right on a magnet.  Oh.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  To make sure it's all clean.  What is that, Steve?  It's what you wanted to hear.  Oh.  How do you put in your resignation?  Yeah, I'm kidding. 
[03:32:00]  Looking great.  Very good.  Bobby's going to be at the Comedy Connection.  Yeah.  I got to sell some fucking tickets, too.  Why?  Because these fucking cocksuckers aren't buying tickets.  What the fuck's wrong with people?  Tell you, it looks weird.  Providence, Rhode Island.  Comedy Connection.  Tomorrow night, Bob Kelly.  Buy your fucking tickets.  Jesus.  Buy your fucking tickets.  And then-  400,000 people saw me in two months when I did that tour.  Jesus.  Go back to the same area.  Yeah.  Cunts. 
[03:32:30]  Where were you?  Bastards.  And-  Boston.  Saturday night, Wilbur Theater.  Saturday night, Wilbur Theater.  Go to WilburTheater.com.  The Wilbur.  TheWilburTheater.com.  Or what is the other one?  I don't know.  R-I-ComedyConnection.com or something like that.  I really don't know.  Yeah.  1-800-745-3000 for the Wilbur Theater, Saturday night with Bob Kelly.  3,000.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  What, are you going to bring a hair dryer up there, you asshole?  Yeah, that's what I do.  I blow dry my hair.  Now I'm reading people are saying, the only time Bobby's an angler is when he was trying 
[03:33:00]  to suck his own cock.  I'd fucking love to deny that, but I almost did snap my own neck.  He's a 45 degree angler.  Maybe even Bobby, you're an angler, because that's what you grab when you're getting  fucked.  Why don't we go all in?  What the fuck?  We just did that.  Yes, it seems like it was moments ago.  We just did that.  Nothing happened early in the show that was worth anything, I guess.  All we had to do was the last half hour for everybody.  I know.  Fuck the last three hours. 
[03:33:30]  You were raising your hand, Bobby?  For real?  Bobby?  Oh, no, no.  I didn't raise my hand.  It was like you were trying to get my attention.  He was practicing fishing.  We're going to have such a good time.  You're going to have a blast.  All right, Bobby.  You're going to have a blast.  All right.  Less excitement.  Let's just see what happens.  This is why you have no friends.  I'm a disappointment.  You go golfing with fucking Voss.  Yeah, we have a really good time.  That's a shit sport.  We actually have a really good time.  But that's a shit sport.  Me and Voss just laughed the entire time around that golf course. 
[03:34:00]  Really?  Yeah.  We're not going to have that much fun.  I know.  Oh, my God.  You better have some fun.  No, because you don't talk when you're fishing.  Oh, if he comes back.  I think you and I are just going to go real deep.  No, we're not going to go deep.  Let's promise we don't go deep.  Well, you can't fish near each other.  Let's keep it light and fun.  We can't fish near each other.  What?  You've got to kind of be down there.  Then why not just go by yourself and then go by himself?  Well, you see each other.  You know what?  We check in with each other every once in a while?  Yeah, check in.  Have lunch together?  We're not going to be a fucking part.  I mean, we're going to be there. 
[03:34:30]  I'll see you.  But we're not going to be next to each other.  We've got our lines tangled.  It's going to be annoying.  And then we catch a trout.  Yo!  And then you release it.  You've got to release it.  I hope I get your excitement on video when you catch a trout.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I want to say.  That is what I want to say.  Can I keep my HD flip somewhere in my waders?  Yeah, if you get the big ones.  Why don't you go to B&H and get a waterproof flip cam thing?  That's work.  I'm not doing shit.  What's wrong with you?  I'm showing up.  What happened to you? 
[03:35:00]  I'm going to pitch my tent.  What happened to you?  There's no tent.  You can't fucking camp.  It's a motel that's owned by Indians.  No, we're...  They're not going to let you camp.  We're getting tents.  I'm not tenting anything.  We're getting tents.  I don't sleep outside.  You got camping equipment?  No, I don't fuck...  You know what?  I don't fuck that.  I could get that from my brother.  So yeah, I'm not doing work for that.  Which brother?  The owner of FH Riley's.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  I'm not can't.  I got a hotel room.  Happy anniversary to Brett and his lovely wife, Carrie.  Oh, man.  Two years.  They've been married today. 
[03:35:30]  Wow, already?  Ready for line of the day?  Did you see the movie The Mist?  Yes.  The Mist.  Which one was that in?  That was the one with The Mist that came over...  One of the best movies I've ever seen.  ...and some people stuck in the store and shit.  They're in a supermarket.  Sucked into The Mist.  That was a fucking great movie.  Tell me that's not a great movie.  I think it was Thomas Jane who was in the Punisher remake.  Fuck it.  The acting in that fucking movie, though...  That was good, but...  That was a great movie.  It was a great...  That was a great fucking movie.  It was Frank Darabont, the same guy that did Shawshank. 
[03:36:00]  Fucking great movie.  Really?  They opened up the fourth dimension?  How crazy is that shit?  Wait, that movie was shit.  Fourth dimension.  Didn't we talk to the guy?  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  And they just let it leak out into our world when the guy was like,  Dude, you take away electricity and 9-1-1, you were all fucked.  Yep.  That's how...  Remember when the lights went out in New York for that day?  Oh, yeah.  Walking down the street, barrels were on fire.  People go crazy.  Girls were getting their fucking pussies grabbed.  And that was one day.  One...  I'm not even kidding.  Imagine a week.  Civilians directing traffic, almost getting hit by cars.  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  One fucking day.  Imagine that a week.  The best picture that came out of that, civilian directing traffic as a traffic cop  is giving some car a ticket.  A ticket, yeah.  No electricity in New York City, and he had a ticket cars.  That was his big concern.  They gave away all the free ice cream?  Every deli gave away their ice cream?  I'm waiting for that.  Why?  I'm just waiting for a complete breakdown of the system.  Of course, because you're going to fucking flip on those generators and...  Oh.  I'm going to be like fucking... 
[03:37:00]  I swear to God, last man on earth.  That's what it's going to be like.  You'll be stirring meat, jerky, powder into a fucking bowl.  Fucking everything.  Gun emplacements.  I'm taking my Vespa out there.  I'm over there.  Yeah, there you go.  Fine.  I need some good shooters.  I'm going to pick up Opie on the way.  Because the zombies follow right after the lights go out.  And we lose power, and it's the zombies.  I'm not doing the Vespa.  But you're not getting on the back of it?  Hell fucking no.  Why not?  That's gay.  You got to try new shit. 
[03:37:30]  That's gay.  That's not gay.  That's just gay.  You're talking about gay.  You just...  We just talked about fucking how to suck your own cock for 25 minutes.  It's not gay.  It's your own cock.  We're not sucking our own cocks, all right?  That's not gay.  With Vespa...  Wait a minute.  Let me get this straight.  With the Vespa, you actually got to hold another man.  You got to just put your fingers in my belly button.  Suck your own cock on your Vespa.  Now that's fucking gay.  Riding down the street sucking your own cock.  Oh, how gay would that be?  By the way, if Vos wants to play golf that weekend, you're out.  Oh.  You know what, Opie? 
[03:38:00]  Flat lever.  Say it.  You know what, Opie?  Say it.  Go ahead.  Say it.  Get me out of this.  You're...  Get me out of this.  ...not coming.  All right.  You're done.  Oh, poor Bobby.  I'm canceling...  No, it's not poor Bobby.  I feel bad for Bobby.  Don't.  Don't feel bad.  You're done.  All right, not that bad.  Don't worry about it.  You're out.  You're out.  You're done.  It's over.  You want to see fake sadness?  No.  I want to fucking...  I want...  I'm going to...  You know what you're going to do later in life?  You're going to be like, I should have went.  I should have experienced that.  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  Really?  You should have experienced something different. 
[03:38:30]  What are you going to do?  Stay home and watch TV in your fucking sweatpants?  All right, look.  I want to go.  No.  I really want to go.  No, you can't go now.  I have to.  Huh?  I have to go.  Say please.  Can I please go fly fishing with you, Bobby?  What's it called?  The...  Bob and Opie.  Well, you said Greg, which was creepy too, by the way.  Greg.  Because I don't want you to be Opie on this one.  I want you to be Greg.  I don't even want to be Opie.  I'm stuck with his fucking name.  I want you to be Greg Hughes.  Do you understand?  The actor that plays Opie.  I was never called by my real name.  This is the only name I fucking know. 
[03:39:00]  You called it the Bobby and Greg fly fishing extravaganza with the dogs and the girls.  Match in the Hatch Weekend.  Match in the Hatch Weekend.  Say it is.  No.  Say it with enthusiasm.  Can we get t-shirts made for the big weekend?  Fuck.  Match the Hatch Weekend?  Fuck yeah.  Match the Hatch.  With a big rainbow or a brookie on the front, like bent in half because it has a fly in the  front.  You come in here with two Match the Hatch 09 Weekend t-shirts?  I'm in.  Yeah.  No.  No.  That's not...  No.  You can't...  You just fucking begged me to be back in. 
[03:39:30]  Now you're switching it up, you psychological fucking nutcase.  It's not happening.  Well, that's what I do.  This is what we're going to do.  We're going to fucking quick video it live over to the compound.  And he'll fucking...  You'll commentate on our fishing techniques.  Yeah.  He'll make fun of us.  And that will be a big argument.  They're not going to make fun...  Why would you make fun of us, Anthony?  Why wouldn't he, Bobby?  I would expect him to make fun of us.  I don't make fun.  He's going to need us at the end of the world to catch trout.  Oh, please.  Can we invite more people?  Who?  So it's not as weird. 
[03:40:00]  This is what I say.  If there's any listeners out there who are professional fly fishermen...  Anglers.  Anglers.  Who have all the stuff that can give Opie, okay?  What the fuck?  I thought you were getting our shit for us.  Hang on.  You might get a free run out of it.  I don't need free stuff.  Shut up.  I'll take it.  Relax.  I don't need free shit.  Why am I whispering into a microphone?  Why don't we do line of the day?  Listen.  Line of the day.  Oh, one more runner up.  We're going to be all set.  You're going to be all set.  Are you in?  Are you out?  I don't know.  No.  Fuck you.  See what I just did? 
[03:40:30]  Now you're begging me again.  You so want me to go.  I get scared.  Why do you want me to go?  Because you're feeling it, right?  We could be friends, I'm thinking.  We're going to have a good time.  And you're going to catch the bug.  No pun intended.  Oh, great.  Here's another runner up line of the day.  I just said the cop, the district attorney.  He thinks he's going to make some big connections in Boston.  You know what, dude?  Sometimes you make some connections.  No, no.  I'm actually going to bomb on this fucking thing. 
[03:41:00]  Really?  This is going to be terrible.  Why?  Cops have a sense of humor?  The singer is, yeah, but fucking.  Like a Justin Volpe.  It's all the, if it was all cops, I'd.  All right.  Very good.  I'm sorry for stepping on that.  Bobby, it's Robert Kelly fans on Twitter.  Yeah, go to my Twitter.  Yep.  Follow me on there.  I'll go to my website.  I think that's the way we do line of the day.  Oh, no.  You've got to sing us out.  So let's do line of the day first.  Rhode Island tomorrow night.  What?  Rhode Island tomorrow night.  Comedy Connection.  Comedy Connection. 
[03:41:30]  And Saturday.  Wilbur Theater.  Wilbur Theater, Boston.  The Wilbur Theater dot com.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day, line of the day, line of the day, line of the day.  What is it?  Does it get hair everywhere?  I woke up twice with my dog on the bed.  I don't like animals in the house.  It's asshole in my face.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Dog is telling the same story. 
[03:42:00]  I'm kidding.  That was a good one.  And Jimmy's off to L.A. with line of the day.  Jay Leno.  No, I was going to say Tuesday.  That's what Joe.  No, it's like a week from.  When is.  No, it's next week.  Really?  And I think Norton's going to be on Tuesdays.  What's he doing on the show?  Like a bit.  Every Tuesday?  No, he's got.  He's going to be on.  I don't know. 
[03:42:30]  Every three weeks or something.  It's cool.  Yeah, it's awesome.  You going to play this out, Bobby?  Yeah.  What was the music again?  Sing us out.  Is that it?  Yeah, sing us out, Bobby.  It was a pleasure.  We'll see you soon.  You're a little louder.  Do you remember your original lyrics?  No.  Okay.  Okay.  It's the Teddy Mountain Highway.

[03:44:00]  Peace.  Throat palms.  Cause I'm fuckin' singin' the Teddy Mountain Highway.  My voice is gone.  On the Teddy Mountain Highway.  Another inane show song stuck in my fuckin' head all day.  Anthony loves when I sing this song.  He wants to tap his feet right along.  On the Teddy Mountain Highway.
