<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a promotional discussion of their upcoming animation festival at the Roseland Ballroom, highlighting the high ticket demand and the online release of the animations featuring comedic interpretations of themselves and guests like Bob Kelly.  This transitioned into a discussion of Anthony's relationship with Jill Nicolini, fueled by a picture of them sharing cake.  A call to Eric Logan, their XM boss, ensued, with Logan jokingly offering Dom PÃ©rignon for their two-week anniversary and commenting on Anthony's upcoming Nashville trip,  speculating about a potential marriage and predicting Anthony's behavior at the Country Music Festival.  Randy Spears, another radio host, then called in, adding to the discussion about Jill's on-air attire.

The show then veered into a highly critical and offensive discussion of the 2008 Democratic primary, focusing on Barack Obama's presumptive nomination and Hillary Clinton's refusal to concede.  This segment included highly offensive comments about Clinton and Michelle Obama's appearances and perceived behavior,  speculation about damaging information held by opposing parties, and the use of racial slurs.  The hosts also discussed the Simpsons' contract renewal and the voice actors' substantial earnings,  followed by announcements of upcoming guests Tito Ortiz and Sean William Scott, and some commentary on a show segment contributor known as "Stunt Brain."

The broadcast continued with a focus on the 2008 presidential election and controversies surrounding Barack Obama, along with the exploits of self-proclaimed vigilante Jimmy Justice.  The election discussion involved further criticism of Hillary Clinton, and a discussion of allegations by Larry Sinclair, who claimed a sexual encounter and drug use with Obama, including playing a recording of Sinclair's YouTube video detailing these claims. The hosts expressed skepticism but debated the veracity of these claims. The segment also included discussion of the website Whitehouse.com and its past association with pornography.  The discussion of Jimmy Justice featured audio clips of his confrontations with traffic officers.  The hosts expressed strong support for Justice's actions.  An audio clip of two teenage girls admitting to stealing money from a Girl Scout led to a humorous but offensive discussion about the Girl Scout and the thieves.

Tito Ortiz then arrived in the studio.  The conversation covered MMA, including Kimbo Slice's fighting style and a brutal injury, Ortiz's own experiences (including cauliflower ear), his autobiography "This Is Gonna Hurt," which detailed his challenging childhood, including his parents' heroin use, poverty, near-misses with criminal activity, and a near-fatal moped accident.  He discussed his relationship with his parents and his current relationship with his ex-wife and his girlfriend, Jenna Jameson, a former porn star. He also discussed his departure from the UFC and the rise of MMA's popularity. Ortiz recounted his first fight and a brutal incident at a Fourth of July celebration. He promoted his book signing before the show transitioned into "Whip It Wednesday," featuring calls and visual displays of women's breasts.  The segment concluded with Jim Norton discussing issues with his AT&T service and an anecdote about acupuncture and diarrhea, leading to the arrival of Sean William Scott.

Sean William Scott's appearance involved discussions about backing up phone numbers, an awkward first date, bowel movements, the shortcomings of BlackBerrys and iPhones, his film roles, and extensive anecdotes involving Bridget the Midget, including explicit details.  He discussed gas prices, his former Hummer, partying in New York versus Los Angeles, and a disturbing audio clip of "Little Marky."  A call from a fan who traveled from Montreal led to a tangent about Robert Pickton.  Patrice O'Neal and Jeffrey Ross were also present during parts of this segment. A clip from a Scientology video and a Jerry O'Connell spoof were also played.

Following Scott's departure, the hosts criticized his appearance.  Jeffrey Ross then joined, discussing his Comedy Central special and high school experiences.  The show then returned to a phone interview with Larry Sinclair, who aggressively defended his claims about Barack Obama. This highly confrontational and sexually charged conversation included crude remarks from the hosts, evasive responses from Sinclair, and mentions of Sinclair's proctologist.  The discussion shifted to Ross's upcoming show at the Borgata and listener-submitted "Lines of the Day," before concluding with a song with misogynistic and sexually explicit lyrics and further off-topic rambling.  Ross appeared briefly to promote his show.  The broadcast concluded with further discussion surrounding Larry Sinclair's allegations and a final exchange with Jeffrey Ross.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs.  O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, O.B. and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, O.B. and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, O.B. and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  Radio shop jobs, O.B. and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  We were number one across the board with men in Morning Drive Radio here in New York City.  Yeah.  We're doing better.  In men, we were number one.  And in women, we crept up to number 375. 
[00:01:00]  So I went to the action park, Chris, and this fine Chinese doctor pops about 20 needles  on me.  Would you take a needle?  What do you need curing besides your alcoholism?  What's up, Anthony?  Is the date officially over?  No.  Do you need help?  You're being held hot.  No, you.  I'm a hot dog of love.  Oh, God.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, a busy, busy morning.  Good morning.  Hi.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Morning.  Starring Jim Norton as Jim Norton.  And Jim Norton as Jim Norton.  That was always so dumb.  Yeah, I know.  We know who that person is.  You don't have to say as.  A Quinn Norton production.  Right.  877-212-0&A. 
[00:02:00]  Where to begin?  Where to begin?  Where to begin?  Can I say I think the animation festival is going to be very good tomorrow night.  It's going to be amazing.  I think we've got a home run on our hands.  A lot of them.  I was screening some of the animations last night.  Screening.  Uh-huh.  At home.  And wow.  Just amazing.  There's some talented people out there.  And some real hacks.  But no.  Actually, most of them aren't hacks.  Dude, I was saying.  Even the ones that... 
[00:02:30]  I can't even say bad ones.  Even the ones that aren't as good as the really good ones.  Right, right.  They're good.  Yeah.  There aren't any really bad ones.  Absolutely not.  And then the good ones are amazing.  There's one that looks like a Pixar animation.  Yeah.  And it's to one of my favorite...  Yeah.  ...pirades that Jimmy went off on.  Absolutely.  The Slaughterhouse.  Yeah.  It's just really well done.  Well put together.  I'm kind of bummed we didn't go with a bigger venue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was talked out of it. 
[00:03:00]  I'm like...  They said, keep it intimate.  I'm like...  God, we should have went 3,000.  It's a seater, man.  Yeah.  It's 1,200 seats.  Roseland Ballroom.  And the tickets went in two days.  And then what's going to happen...  Because the only reason we're talking about the animation festival...  Because people can't get a ticket at this point.  Well, we are bringing it up.  Because by Friday morning, these animations are going to be on a website for everybody to check out.  I mean, everybody.  I don't know what the website is yet.  I'm sure it'll be linked to all the other websites you guys know and love. 
[00:03:30]  And then they go to iTunes after two days.  So I think you got like two days to download and check them out for free.  And then we're going to get a little cash out of this.  Really cool, though.  Just a little bit, a little bit.  Yeah.  I was watching them and just laughing.  Yeah, absolutely.  Laughing out loud.  I was LOLing.  The ecstasy of gold one.  Wow.  Yeah, that's amazing.  The song we start to show off every morning was animated.  Yeah.  And it just features everybody.  Great job.  Unbelievable.  I like the different interpretations of us in each of the animations. 
[00:04:00]  Absolutely.  How we look different, obviously, in all the animations.  But everybody did a great job of animating us.  Really cool.  It was fun to see the three different opes or ants.  Some are really chiseled and some are just ugly.  Yeah, messes.  Some are muscular.  Yeah, it's true.  Some people had us looking cool.  Other people had us looking really bad.  Looking ragged.  It's like, okay, that's a gay guy that's in love with me. 
[00:04:30]  This guy's just a fat fan.  This is how he thinks we look.  It's so obvious.  You could get a lot out of the animator by his work.  And Jimmy looks the same in every animation.  They got you down in animations.  I look the same whether it's muscular or fat.  I look awful in every one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He never looked like, wow, good.  Right.  And certain guests look great, too.  My favorite, of course, has to be Bob Kelly. 
[00:05:00]  People had a lot of fun animating Bob Kelly in a couple of these things.  Yeah.  And he just looks amazingly huge.  I can't wait for tomorrow.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  I think we're on to something.  And Jimmy was so excited.  We were watching some of the animations yesterday.  He's like, get HBO, get Comedy Central down there.  Get them down there.  I think we easily have a half-hour show.  You should.  Let's definitely.  Let's see it, yeah.  I mean, I don't know if they do shows.  I don't know if it's a â I don't know.  Yeah.  I just think that you should get people that put comedy on TV to see it because it's very 
[00:05:30]  original and the animations are very original.  And if they're looking to do that, I think they would like it.  And what I like about it, too, is instead of a cartoon where it's the same animator throughout  the whole thing, if we had some kind of half-hour show, it's like you could see a different  version of Anthony and I and Jimmy.  You know what I mean?  Because it's different animators and they have a different way of animating and that  makes it very interesting as well.  And the material is beyond strong because they only take the best of the best bits we've 
[00:06:00]  done over the years.  And the weird thing about this â  Not the crap that goes on on a daily basis.  Well, good luck finding any of that.  The funny thing about this is you hear laughter.  It's like we're watching a cartoon that has laughter in it, but it's real because of the  in-studio reactions.  Yeah.  It's not like canned laughter.  So it's like you're watching a show that has an audience, but it's a cartoon.  It's a really bizarre thing to animate radio show.  Right.  I've never â yeah, I've never seen it done like that.  And one of the things I really like is when people are adding in things that have nothing 
[00:06:30]  to do with what we're talking about.  Like that's kind of the talent of the animator.  Some people have added little things in like the way we're dressed, what's around us,  little idiosyncrasies we might have that aren't being addressed in the audio that they animated.  Right.  But the animator thought it would be funny to throw those things in.  Yeah.  And that stuff is really, really well done.  One of the animations has us all as like rocks or potatoes.  Yeah.  I think rocks.  Yeah.  I wasn't â what?  Bob is a ham.  Yeah, Bob is a ham. 
[00:07:00]  Bob Kelly is a ham.  And Anthony's character is a rock.  And there's so many guns around your animated rock.  And that's what made me laugh harder than the actual material.  Yeah, that's just it.  Like some of these guys have added in their own stuff and it's really great.  Yeah, if you've got a ticket to the Roseland Ballroom tomorrow night, I think you're in  for a treat.  Top notch.  Top notch.  I really think this is going to be a really, really good event tomorrow night.  So winning that animation tournament, now that's important. 
[00:07:30]  Doors open at 7 tomorrow night.  And once again, Friday the animations will be all over the ball field for everybody to  check out that obviously can't make it tomorrow night.  Okay?  All right.  Hey, I was out to dinner with Brother Weez last night.  My mentor from Rochester, New York, who's not allowed to do radio until November, he's  got the worst non-compete ever.  Wow.  Ever.  Yeah.  Do you still get paid?  Well, the news station that picked him up is doing the right thing and he made him  kind of a sales guy so he could get some money coming in because he's got four kids 
[00:08:00]  and an ex-wife that's a nightmare and all this stuff.  Which, what amazes me, his old station wanted to pay him 50% less than what he was making.  And he's like, no way, I'm underpaid to begin with.  He's like, no one comes close to what he's doing in Rochester, New York.  So he couldn't take that deal.  So they turn around and go, well, all right, then you've got a no-compete for a year.  How is that fair?  A year.  Imagine your employer goes, look, next year I'm going to pay you 50% less. 
[00:08:30]  And if you don't take this, you can't work for anybody else in this business for a year.  Why do I think it's important to fight that?  Aren't they illegal in certain places?  Yeah, they are, yeah.  They're saying you can't work for a year.  Right.  It's just amazing.  So he's in radio hell.  And I've given him a lot of advice because Ann and I had to sit out two years and three months.  I'm like, a year?  That's a cakewalk.  Dude, that's standing on my head.  You could easily do that.  Yeah.  So he's in a good place because he's down to like six months before he's back on the radio. 
[00:09:00]  But we were out last night.  And I only bring up that because all of a sudden my Blackberry goes off.  And there's a picture of Anthony and Jill, also known as Anthelini,  enjoying a fine piece of cake, was it?  Yeah, I believe it was the apple, it's like the apple crisp.  The apple crisp.  Oh, it's very good there at FH Riley's.  And yeah, he went to FH Riley's, my bro's restaurant out there in Huntington.  And Keith writes, is this picture up on onaradio.com yet? 
[00:09:30]  Holy crap.  Okay.  What?  Nothing.  Oh.  Jim's just trying to be respectful.  The girl on Fox, I mean.  We're not allowed to comment on Jill anymore.  I'm saying holy crap to the weather conditions, not that shirt she has on.  Holy mackerel.  Ant's the only one that looks up at the TV at this point.  We all awkwardly look down and make believe she's not on TV.  Oh, you.  That's what it's come down to.  But Keith sends this picture of Anthony and Jill at FH Riley's 
[00:10:00]  feeding each other cake like they just got married.  What?  It was us just hanging out, having fun on our two-week anniversary.  Well, that's what Keith wrote.  He goes, picture of Anthony.  Look at Jimmy's face.  Did you write what Keith wrote?  Yeah, okay.  Keith writes, picture of Anthony and Jill enjoying their two-week anniversary cake at FH Riley's.  They're on a tour of whimsy.  A tour of whimsy? 
[00:10:30]  You guys are going to, like, one Monday, we're going to start the radio show,  and you're going to go, we went to Vegas and got married.  We figured it was about time we'd been going out a month.  Yeah.  That we needed to get married.  You know, you have to wait a while.  Right.  Feel each other out.  See if you're compatible in a month.  Yeah.  That seems long enough.  How do you not know somebody in a month?  Did you, what time did you leave last night?  I asked because there's a reason I'm asking. 
[00:11:00]  Leave FH?  Yeah.  Geez.  Wasn't that late?  Nine something?  Okay.  Because I was on the phone with Eric Logan, our boss at XM, and this picture comes in.  I start laughing.  I go, dude, I just got a picture of Ancelini, like, feeding each other cake.  He goes, what's the number of FH Riley's?  He was going to send you a bottle of Dom.  He was going to send you a bottle of Dom to celebrate your two-week anniversary.  And I go, if they're eating the cake, I don't think they're there anymore, but you could 
[00:11:30]  try.  So I'm not sure if you ever got the message.  And Eric's not one of these guys that just talks a good game.  Trust me.  Oh, I know.  He would have made it happen.  That Dom would have been on that table if he knew you were still there.  No, we were actually being responsible.  We knew we had to get home and get to sleep.  So what, you only shared three bottles of wine instead of five or six?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, we can only have, but did you talk to Elo about Nashville?  Is he going down there? 
[00:12:00]  That's why he basically told, you want me to tell you what he said?  What?  He goes, Anthony's obviously whipped because he doesn't like country.  What is he doing going down to the Country Music Festival in Nashville, Tennessee?  Does anybody remember a little story called Dreamweaver?  What do you think I was doing back then?  I grew up, my roots were based in country music and horseback riding and wearing Western gear. 
[00:12:30]  That's how I grew up.  I was a cowboy on a steel horse I ride.  I'm wanted dead or alive.  The closest I get to country is the Allman Brothers, Johnny Cash, and very, well, and then  I would go Eagles.  That's the closest I come to country music.  I'm not in there.  Skinner, kind of.  A little skinner.  See, Southern Rock, though, is very different than country.  I understand that.  And especially when I came back from California, Southern Rock was huge here in New York.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Like, a lot of guys in high school and stuff were listening to Charlie Daniels, Marshall Tucker,  the Outlaws, all that.  But that was Southern Rock.  I was listening to country, which was, you know, now I guess it would be considered classic  country.  But that's what I was listening to.  And people made fun of me.  I wore my cowboy boots to school and, you know, people would be like, what the hell is  that?  But I grew up in that environment.  So it's not that alien to me.  I don't know.  I've, I've, no, we've been doing, no, we've been doing radio for 14 years. 
[00:13:30]  We've never done a country music break in our lives.  We had a great interview with Travis Tritt.  Yeah.  We talked about air conditioning because we didn't know.  Travis Tritt was a tin knocker.  Yeah.  That's what we talked about because we didn't know what song he sang.  Well, there's always a time to learn new things.  All right.  Name me one Travis Tritt song.  Yes, exactly.  All right.  Name me one country song.  That song about the guy.  With the thing and it was very painful. 
[00:14:00]  Christmas shoes.  How about name me five country artists?  Ah.  And don't go with Alabama.  All right.  You old Alabama.  I want five newer country artists.  Go.  Okay.  Don't look down at how far.  Travis Tritt.  Okay.  That's one.  That got me off.  That was like the free, that's like this free square in bingo.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think I'm making my point.  Um, you're going because Charlotte church. 
[00:14:30]  She doesn't do country.  Oh yeah.  She does that other opera stuff.  Um, let me think.  Close though.  No.  Oh, who's the one that won American Idol?  Um, oh my God.  Carrie Underwood.  Okay.  She's a crossover artist, but still considered country.  More country than anything.  Yeah.  Garth Brooks.  Of course Garth Brooks.  I was just going to say Garth Brooks.  And, uh, that, uh, the broad, um, say, what are you doing?  Conway Twitty.  What are you doing? 
[00:15:00]  You are going way back.  What are you doing?  What am I doing?  You're going, we are going to go to Nashville.  Right.  And watch the Nashville bar scenes.  We're going to hang out and drink in Nashville.  Right.  Oh, here's a text from Elo.  Oh.  Um, OMSL.  What, what is he doing?  What is that?  This is my, our boss at XM.  He just writes OMSL.  What am I supposed to sell a stock?  What am I, what is this? 
[00:15:30]  OMSL.  Put some puts on OMSL, whatever that is.  This is a secret message.  What is he saying?  Why am I sounding like, what is OMSL?  CEL or SEL?  Yes, SEL.  Yeah, but it's ELO, so I just figured he spelled sell wrong.  Oh, he's wrong.  On my cell.  So what?  He wants us to call him?  Oh.  Is that it?  Why wouldn't he just write on my?  He left off two letters to save time?  He's a busy man.  How busy are you, Eric?  He's so busy.  He's going to tip that glass back up to his mouth. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Well.  It's that whiskey.  Let me see if I can get, oh wait, he's, he wrote me again here.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, because he was like, why?  He obviously is, has no, he doesn't like country music.  Uh, on my cell.  All right.  So he wants us to call us.  Do we, do you know how to get a hold of him?  You do?  Okay.  Sure.  We'll get Eric Logan on the line because Eric Logan is, uh, on the board of directors of  all of Nashville.  Yeah.  A little known fact about our boss over at XM. 
[00:16:30]  He's a huge country music fan.  Yes, he is.  He was one of the premier country music PDs in the country before he moved way up in  the radio world.  And he will be down there.  Got to hook up and, uh, maybe tip a couple back.  Is he drinking these days at all?  No.  So that means, so that means you're not going to be hooking up with Eric Logan.  We get a temperance lecture from Eric.  Can I have the, yeah.  Yeah.  Can I have the unfun?  Yeah.  E-low.  Yeah.  Uh, let's say how to Randy Spears from WBLI out there on Long Island. 
[00:17:00]  Randy Spears.  Hey, O.B.  Oh, God.  Hi, Randy.  How are you?  Oh, my God.  I'm looking at your girlfriend this morning, Jill Nicolini, and I can barely look at her.  I looked up.  I thought she had on a half shirt.  Yeah, she looks like she's wearing a belly shirt on TV this morning.  That's what Jimmy was getting at.  It's a two-colored shirt.  That's Ants Girl.  Yeah, that's Ants.  Good whore.  Could you please text her and tell her to change that shirt? 
[00:17:30]  Why would I do that?  Because I can't really stand to look at her.  Well, you don't really.  Well, something tells me, uh, yeah, you're probably more the, uh, Anchorman type.  Ha ha.  I know Jill Nicolini.  I'm going to call her myself.  Well, you do that, Randy.  Why don't you do that?  I saw your picture on the CW 11.  Oh, you two look like you're made for each other.  Uh, thank you, Randy.  Uh, this is...  Could you please text her, though, and tell her to change that shirt up? 
[00:18:00]  Because it looks like she's half naked.  Well, what's wrong with that, Randy?  Is that bad?  You want to see Craig, uh, Treadway, uh, half naked, right?  Yeah, have them switch shirts.  That would be perfect.  Right.  What's with Randy?  Don't you guys have a, your own morning show to do?  Yeah, we got to do our dirt now in a minute.  All right, well...  Can only imagine what that is.  Yeah.  Well, thank you, Randy.  All right, tell Jill to change that shirt up!  Yeah, sure. 
[00:18:30]  Randy Spears from...  I mean, really, he's calling from his own morning show out there in Long Island.  Yeah, that's him.  This is how interesting this dumb storyline is, that, like, other morning shows aren't even  doing their show anymore.  They just want to get the latest update.  Well, the latest update is, and celebrated at FH Riley's, his two weeks of being in love.  Two happy weeks.  And he's flying to Nashville this weekend for the Country Music Festival.  Uh, Eric Logan is on the phone here.  Elo!  I have to tell you, for the first time in my four-year career actually working day-to-day 
[00:19:00]  with this show, I'm officially scared.  Why?  What's the matter, Elo?  What's the matter?  I have what many people in the industry would call a fairly substantial or fairly good reputation  in the great, fine city of Nashville, Tennessee.  Mm-hmm.  Mayor Purcell.  Oh, no.  And what's going to happen here, and let me just tell you what's going to happen here.  15 years of going to Music Fest and Fanfare, this is what happens.  It starts very innocently on Broadway at a bar called Tootsies. 
[00:19:30]  And by the way, for the record, Anthony, Conway 20 is dead.  Well, I told you that.  So all those names.  I know.  Okay.  How about Rascal Flatts or Kenny Chesney?  No.  George Strait.  Toby Keith.  No, now he's reading it.  I know.  Now he's reading it.  Tim McGraw.  Now you've got a chance to have a test to give you a bunch of names from Palpaw.  Brad Paisley.  I know these people.  Where'd you do?  Hey, by the way, turn your computer screens off and quick, name one person in Rascal Flatts  or where Brad Paisley's from. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, where is Brad Paisley from there, Anthony?  From West Virginia.  West Virginia.  Who's he married to?  Who's he married to?  Oh, he's married to, obviously, that, what's her name?  God, it slips on my mind for a second.  That blonde, right?  It's the girl.  Yeah.  Very pretty girl.  So here's how it's going to start, Opie and Jimmy.  Yeah.  He's going to start at Tootsie's, okay, which is a very famous bar behind the ground opry.  He'll be drinking the coldest beer in town.  And then there's a bar crawl that goes about five bars.  He'll make it about halfway down.  He'll get a little tipsy. 
[00:20:30]  He'll get a little loud because there's a lot of singing, okay?  Every place has a microphone.  I got probably three to four hours into the night before Anthony's on stage singing with  a variety of hillbillies.  A variety?  Can you film your time in Nashville for the website?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Because if you're going to be singing with hillbillies...  And then it's going to be, hey, you New York Jersey guys, shut the F up because they  don't go kindly to the accent.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  That's going to lead into some sort of police altercation.  Oh, okay.  Which will be, who do you work for?  Which will be, well, I work for XM, and then somehow, someway, my phone will ring by Saturday.  Elo knows that too well.  No, something tells me this is exactly what happened to Elo at some point in his life.  I can't comment on that.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a 20-year statute of limitations in the city.  Now, Elo, I hear you're not tipping him back as much. 
[00:21:30]  Well, I've stopped the drinking.  I've drank enough in 15 years of my life that I can't drink again.  And won't that be a little tempting, though, being down in Nashville?  I know a lot of parties go on.  Well, it could and it couldn't.  What, are you going to drink O'Doul's?  No, I just drink water and pee a lot.  So, here's a question that I want to know from you, Ant. 
[00:22:00]  I mean, at what point do you guys just, like, check?  When do you get there, is the first question.  I assume you're getting there Friday afternoon.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, and just so I know, because I don't know if the calls come into the offices.  So, do you and Jill have, like, tickets done?  I mean, is it a scene?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is all, everything's taken care of.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to make a phone call and make sure you had, like, really good God passes to get everywhere,  but I can cancel that request. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, well, no.  You know, anything you can do there, Mr. Logan, would be greatly appreciated, of course.  And the last question I have is, is there any truth to the rumor that Jill will be wearing that same fishnet top  she was wearing in the photo last night?  Oh, last night.  Oh, right.  Wasn't that a nice top?  This is what I can tell you.  Many people mortgage their trailers and homes to get to Music Fest every year, okay?  And if you are going to parade that up and down Broadway, I highly recommend you change the articles of clothing 
[00:23:00]  and have additional security.  Yeah.  I might have to just temporarily just buy a gun.  Well, that will be, well, there'll be plenty of guns in Nashville, don't worry about that.  It is a concealed weapon state.  Great.  Unbelievable.  Put that in mind.  And then, at what point will you buy a hat?  Are you going to actually buy a hat?  Well, you know, I have to fit in, so I think, yeah, I think I'm going to need a hat. 
[00:23:30]  I think I'm going to need some boots, a big old belt buckle.  Spurs.  Well, not spurs.  I think I'm going to need spurs.  I'll just go with the spurs.  Looks silly.  Not really.  And a Western shirt, of course.  Well, if you would like, we are broadcasting live on XM all Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  I can have John Anthony, who's our program director of the Country Channel, have you by,  and we can do one of those really fancy cross plugs for the O&A show. 
[00:24:00]  Well, that would be something.  I can talk about some of my experiences down in Nashville.  Yeah, I'm sure this is going to happen.  Who are you kidding?  And A-O-P?  Actually do extra work for the show?  What?  What?  You're going to hell over?  Hell's going to freeze over, too.  You actually think Ant's going to do some extra lifting for the O.P. and Anthony show while  he's down there in Nashville with his hot girlfriend?  This is what I thought, slash hoped, no, won't happen. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, okay, good.  John Anthony, I would call and say, hey, he'll be very excited because it's the biggest show  on the network.  And one of the guys is coming to town.  And he'll want to take you all around and show you off.  And then what's going to happen is, John's going to be in a lobby of your hotel, and he'll  look at his watch and be pacing, and Ant won't show up.  And he'll be like, well, Anthony's going to be here, and he'll take you, and you won't  show up.  And then you'll call and just, hey, man, sorry.  Got a little crazy.  I don't like how Elo kind of knows me a little too much after all these years. 
[00:25:00]  He's had four years to get to know you.  He's spot on.  All right, Elo, thank you.  Thank you, sir.  And Anthony, call me later, and I will line up things for you to blow off and cancel for  your own trip.  Okay, thank you.  Hey, Elo, what's the over-under, Anthony getting married by the end of the year?  Over-under by the end of the year?  I'll take by the end of the calendar year summer of this year. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  You know, that marriage thing that he said he would never do again.  You watch what happens.  You watch what happens now.  Here's what I believe.  Here's the over-under.  I actually think Anthony potentially could get married before our merger happens.  Well, he'll be on Mars bases, living on other planets by the time that happens.  Come on.  Push this thing through.  I think he gets married before I do. 
[00:26:00]  And I'm not that far away at this point.  And by the way, if you think he's going to get close, you can always move your wedding  off two or three weeks.  Yeah.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Have a good show.  Thank you.  Oh, we forgot to ask him about the dom, but he really was going to send that bottle.  I'm sure he was.  To celebrate two weeks.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, two weeks.  Into a relationship.  It was our two-week anniversary.  But, oh, the memories we have over two weeks. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Seems like just yesterday we were getting cats fixed in Ridge.  Oh, yes.  Let's take a break.  Let's take a break.  We got lots to do today.  Obviously, Obama.  It's all about Obama today.  But Hillary's trying to make it about her still.  And McCain is talking about change, which is sort of the Obama thing.  Pat from Monocci suggesting I get a pre-nuptialini.  Man, man, Pat.  Well, man, Pat's always good for one.  Man, man, man, man. 
[00:27:00]  And there was a secret message from Jill to Anthony today as she was doing her traffic  just a little while ago.  We have that after the break.  And just a lot of stuff here.  Plenty to do.  Hey, everybody.

[00:32:30]  And here's the secret message to Anthony, and I swear this was for Anthony.  She's trying to do her traffic this morning in what looks like a half shirt.  Very, very attractive this morning.  All is free and clear at the Williamsburg, the Manhattan, and the Brooklyn Bridge.  And we just got a call to our traffic tip line from Anthony. 
[00:33:00]  Looks like we do have some trouble to hear some flooding, actually.  Southbound and northbound on the Henry Hudson Parkway.  I've been told they don't even have a traffic tip line.  They don't even have one.  How far do you have to read into it?  We've been told by Anthony there's some flooding.  Please.  Right.  Please.  Well, you know.  What are you going to do?  I got a tip from Shmoopy.  Shmoopy.  You're Shmoopy.  Linda Church is stepping it up, though. 
[00:33:30]  Wow, she looks fantastic.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I might be able to get you two kids together.  She knows you're single, Jimmy.  And she's like, well, it worked out for Jill.  Maybe I could get a little shock jock action.  All we need is a professional wrestler to make the go-between.  Yeah.  And we're fine.  She's very sexy.  Look at her.  That nice, large bosom.  Very matronly bosom.  You like that?  I do.  She'd probably grab my head and say nurturing things.  Hold me her breast.  Linda Church?  No.  Want to go out on a little date? 
[00:34:00]  No.  No.  No.  Not that she's very attractive, but it's like, I don't date TV girls.  I'm too intimidated.  Yeah.  I'm too nervous.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max?  I got to say, first of all, it's the funniest goddamn thing when you New Yorkers come down  and try to dress up like cowboys.  And then the second thing I got to say is, Anthony, when you get down to Nashville and  you're down there defending your cousin for murder, don't forget to ask him what a grit 
[00:34:30]  is and remind him that Jill's a mechanic.  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I don't know what that was.  Chris, my cousin of any reference, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I was figuring that, I guess.  Yeah.  But I haven't seen the movie in a while.  You should remember the line, the two youths, and everybody's like, youths.  I never got sick of that one.  All right.  I got you.  Chris, calling us from the Poconos, of course, just hanging out in a heart-shaped tub. 
[00:35:00]  What do you got, Chris?  I think Ant's going to be looking like Marty McFly when he went back to the Old West.  When he had to dress up and call himself Clint Eastwood, and he was dressed in what looked  like a Halloween costume cowboy outfit.  Yeah.  No, I don't think.  I think it's just going to be fun to go out and have some drinks there in Nashville.  Hang out.  I can hang with anybody. 
[00:35:30]  I can hang out with anybody.  Don't you worry about me.  Yeah, it's not exactly.  I won't be out of place.  He's not going to Tanzania.  Yeah, but they're not used to New Yorkers coming down for the Country Fest.  Thank you.  There's got to be at least one a year that shows up and winds up dead.  I'm kidding.  Come on.  Stop me.  Stop me.  All right.  We're going to move on for now.  Of course.  But the big news Anthony celebrates.  Two weeks. 
[00:36:00]  Two weeks.  And there's a huge trip to Nashville planned starting Friday.  With that, we play this.  Who's the best candidate going to fix health care before it's too late?  You're damn right.  Who's the man who changed the economy for the working man?  He's the cat that'll get our troops out. 
[00:36:30]  He knows what Iraq is all about.  Right on.  Some say Barack is a young mother.  I'm just talking about Barack.  He's an educated man who wants to be your president man.  Barack Obama.  You've got to vote for this man.  Thank you so much. 
[00:37:00]  Thank you very much.  And that'll put him over with the white voters.  Well, that's what I was saying.  That's going to work.  Yeah, you know, Barack, is he officially the Democratic nominee?  Unofficially official.  Because this Hillary refuses to step aside.  But it should have been a great night for Barack.  He wraps up the nomination and she's still in the mix.  Step aside and let the guy have the spotlight. 
[00:37:30]  He's got enough delegates.  For the good of your dumb party.  Super delegates.  Right.  To put him over the top as the proposed candidate for the Democratic Party.  And she won't leave.  She ain't leaving.  She's waiting until she gets paid back, apparently.  Well, that's what Stunt Brain's saying today.  Stunt Brain, you got info on this?  Because we learned that Stunt Brain is all about studying politics.  Oh, he knows everything.  He likes his NPR.  It's like sports.  No, it's not. 
[00:38:00]  Well, more like a soap opera.  Only without any excitement.  Yeah, this isn't like the Stanley Cup Finals, which is just amazing.  This isn't like the Lakers and Celtics going at it for the first time in 21 years.  This is not like Ali Frazier.  No, this is just boredom.  Okay.  Boredom.  It's tedium.  Well, she owes so much money that the story is she's asking him to help her down or pay  down her debt, and then she'll throw her support behind him.  And that whole thing yesterday about her saying she would accept the nomination if it would 
[00:38:30]  help the party to vice presidency was just to take all the wind out of his sails and prove  to him that she has the jam to slow him down.  Because it should have been his day.  But at 4 o'clock yesterday, she made a conference call that said, I'd take the nomination for  VP if it would help.  And all the attention went off him and to him.  So she really just shot him right in the leg.  Because she's a selfish, fat, butter-legged soccer mom.  Butter-legged.  And what he should do is just make her eat that 40 million. 
[00:39:00]  Let her stupid voters go to McCain.  That's how I am.  I'm stubborn.  I'm saying give up the presidency.  This is why I am where I am.  I'm from nowhere.  Just to get back at her.  I don't believe that her supporters would run to McCain.  I don't believe it.  I don't believe that those liberals would run to McCain who wants to keep people in Iraq.  I don't believe it.  They would forgive Barack for not wanting to pay off the slobs, $40 million in selfish  debt.  Too bad.  Nobody wanted you to be president.  You're a wife.  You should be home making a muffin because you already have, looks like that's what comes 
[00:39:30]  over the top of your belt.  Make a muffin for the hubby.  That's what you do, muffin maker.  The man was president.  You're a muffin maker in the White House.  I would be JP.  Would you really?  Yeah.  Well, nobody wants you.  Thanks for that.  That'd be a huge mistake, I think, on their part.  But, uh, God, McCain just looks so old and out of touch.  Well, I think we're going to, you know, he's going to be my guy.  I got to vote for him.  I don't like that Obama wife. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my God.  Do I not like her at all?  For four years, how great would she be?  She'll say something crazy.  She's great.  She's like Florida Evans in the White House.  You know how great it would be for this radio show if we have a black president and a Michelle  Obama to make fun of?  She is scary, man.  Wow.  She gave her hubby a little congratulatory.  It wasn't even like a handshake.  You ever see how when, uh, and in the past, say a guy wins the nomination, the wife comes 
[00:40:30]  up, gives him a little hug and a kiss.  Maybe they raise each other's hands in victory like that.  She gave him this secret little handshake-y thing, which only, to me, meant we are that  much closer to the race war, hun.  It was some kind of little fist-punchy, thumb-uppy thing, which was kind of like, whoa.  No, a secret handshake between husband and wife.  Oh, no.  What's the matter with you? 
[00:41:00]  What's the matter with me?  Not Farrakhan he's doing it with.  It was a little, I was a little weirded out by it.  Why?  Because she seems like she has some influence over this gentleman.  And she seems a little more less than mainstream, the way Barack is trying to really work both  sides of the fence here.  He is.  He's trying to keep black people on board, because he is a black man.  And he's also trying to not scare away white people by coming off as, let's just say, 
[00:41:30]  too black.  Do you mean this phony is trying to appeal to different voters?  I don't like it.  Dude, they're all awful.  Look at Bill Clinton's influence.  He's out and 20 minutes later, his hole is running for president herself.  I mean, come on.  Of course there's a...  Yes, but this is a very sensitive, touchy issue, and has been for many years in this  country, this race relations between black and white.  And I think having a wife like, what's her name, Michelle? 
[00:42:00]  Like Michelle Obama, could be detrimental.  He has, in the past, kept her pretty quiet.  But he doesn't really let her speak too much, because I think he knows there's some things  that come out of her mouth that could trip him up.  She definitely runs the household.  It doesn't matter that he could be the president of the United States.  But when he comes home at night, she runs the joint.  I just picture that neck of hers and the head going back and forth going, what'd you say? 
[00:42:30]  Colin and I were talking on the way home from the cellar one night, and he was raising  an interesting point about how he thinks she might have something on him.  Michelle?  Not on Colin.  What could she have on Colin?  No, I mean...  But Michelle...  Well, yeah.  No, I was just reiterating.  Michelle has something on her own husband.  That's just Colin's theory.  Very interesting.  Yeah.  And what does that mean?  I don't know.  He didn't elaborate.  What do I know?  Then he's onto something else.  You know, just talking about Bob Kelly again. 
[00:43:00]  But he did raise a good point.  And then I went back to that YouTube video.  Yeah.  And I was like, Barack, you know it's true, in the back of the limo.  You never know.  That's all.  Oh, maybe something like that.  Okay.  Oh, that guy was a kook.  It's one of my favorite things to play.  Can we replay that tonight?  Oh, where the hell is that?  We'll find it.  He was so specific in what he did, and the way he talked to Barack about how you know it's  true.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm like, ugh.  I don't know about that.  That was a little familiar.  And there's supposed to be some kind of tape of Michelle Obama saying, whitey, I guess. 
[00:43:30]  Is that a rumor?  Or is that true?  Who cares?  And the Republicans have it.  They're just waiting.  We are whiteys.  Yeah, Anthony, you're, ah, whatever.  What, whitey?  No, but you don't think McCain is throwing around some stuff?  Of course he is.  All right.  Well, let the other side throw around some stuff.  Michelle Obama throws around, if there's tape of her referring to white people as whitey,  that is detrimental to his campaign.  Yeah, it is.  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  I agree with you on that one. 
[00:44:00]  But she's just thinking the same stuff like McCain is thinking.  But it's derogatory.  And that would get any other candidate thrown out if it was the other way around.  It's the old double standard thing, which I understand exists.  It's not like you're going to say, oh, well, why does this have to be this way?  They could say this.  We can't do this.  Because that's just the way it is.  Right.  But why are we surprised, like, that black people, for real, like, have a little resentment?  Like, it's not a big deal.  Whitey is kind of, who cares?  That doesn't bother me.  Who cares?  No, I don't care.  No one, really.  I don't care if anyone called me Whitey. 
[00:44:30]  I get mad when I'm called Honky.  That one, you know.  Honky, when you step back in your time machine?  Yeah.  That's the one that's 73.  That's the one that hurts me dearly.  Honky.  Yeah, honky.  That's brutal.  It's just one of those things where I don't, you can't give any leeway if you're not getting any.  And that's what I'm saying.  If she can go around, and it's all alleged, I'm not saying she said anything, but the rumor is it, that she said Whitey. 
[00:45:00]  And if she can go around and say that, then, you know, other things should be able to be said about her husband.  And I'm not even talking about, you know, the A-bomb of what can be said about him.  I'm just talking about little things that people have had to apologize for in the past when they mention Obama.  They've got to treat him with kid gloves, everybody, or else they're getting fired.  They've got to sit there and apologize.  Screw you.  Ralph in Louisville writes, Whitey thing is a retarded internet rumor. 
[00:45:30]  And look, everybody.  She said, why'd he?  Why'd he?  Why?  Like, why did he?  Why'd he do it?  Why'd he do it?  Well, she said, why'd he?  And the bottom line is, Obama had to apologize, too, for something that Jeremiah Wright said.  Then he had to leave his church because of something racially inflammatory that a white priest in his church said.  Everybody is a groveling, dishonest worm with race.  Black people included.  I mean, Obama had to apologize for crap and distance himself from a church. 
[00:46:00]  I'm not going to apologize because I was just talking about shaving someone's leg, a girl's leg.  And I said, Nick her, because it just nicked her leg.  And why should I apologize for that?  You're right.  Whoa.  Fair enough.  All right, let's take a break.  When we get back, a couple quick clips of what Obama said last night as he, quote, wrapped up the nomination.  Whitey.  And then we go back to one of our favorite clips.  We haven't played this in a while.  Larry Sinclair's Obama story. 
[00:46:30]  This guy is just the greatest.  Oh, that Larry?  That's the guy?  Yeah, we love him.  Larry Sinclair.  We love Larry Sinclair.  Larry Sinclair.  He's all throat.  O.P. and Anthony.  Where are my Clash fans this morning?  It's the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:47:00]  877-212-ON-A.  Let's not forget about onaradio.com.  Kind of a quickie, but just amazing.  The Simpsons.  Yeah.  Signed up for four more years.  How long has that show been on?  How many?  20, that's right.  20 years.  So they signed for another four years.  They should be signing for another four years.  They're still huge, right? 
[00:47:30]  The voice cast.  Guess how much they're going to get an episode.  An episode for...  And this is each...  I know.  I know where we're going with this.  But still.  I already know.  But now, how many episodes do they do a season, do you think?  22?  Huh?  20 to 20.  Holy crap.  So let's do the math.  So in four years, they're going to do at least 80, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Holy crap.  Wait, let me guess.  Can I guess how much they're going to make an episode?  Yes.  I know you expect me to go 1,500 an episode, but I know it's not that. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  2 billion.  Perhaps less than that, Jim.  The main voice guys are going to get $400,000 per episode for the next four years.  And we're figuring 80 episodes?  32 million.  What?  That's 32 million each.  32 million.  What?  22 mil.  32 million each.  What?  That's a lot of money.  That's nice.  What?  8 million a year.  They're going to make 8 million?  No, come on.  8 million a year to do cartoony voices. 
[00:48:30]  And how many of these guys are going to make 400,000 an episode?  You got at least one.  Well, obviously the main players.  How many main players?  Five.  About five of them?  Five main players.  Where are they getting all this money from?  Advertisers.  There's no, there's no, they have to pay out for last year.  For Seinfeld, Jerry was making a million episode, I think, and they were all making 500,000.  Unbelievable.  They were going to go up to a million apiece an episode, and Jerry, five million, but Seinfeld  turned it down.  He didn't need the money at that point.  There's no sets, though. 
[00:49:00]  They don't make any sets on the show, so they don't have to do any of that.  They pay those animators in the Philippines to do the drawings, so they're-  They do it in the Philippines?  They were doing it in the Philippines.  Where is it now, Iraq?  Korea.  It's in Korea now, so they found a cheaper place.  And the merchandising is over a billion dollars a year.  That's amazing.  God bless those guys.  Wow.  So they're going to make 32 million in the next four years.  And they're all, you know, multi-millionaires to begin with, obviously.  Of course.  We also have to plug, we have Tito Ortiz coming in today. 
[00:49:30]  That's right.  I'm psyched about it.  We got Tito.  We also have Sean William Scott.  He was on our show, and he was a lot of fun.  He's promoting his latest movie, The Dude from American Pie.  I'm sure he doesn't want to be known as The Dude from American Pie.  Also, Dude, Where's My Car?  And he was in Mr. Woodcock.  Mr. Woodcock.  And other films.  Dukes of Hazzard.  Dukes of Hazzard, yeah.  And he was in that Will Ferrell movie.  Which one?  And the one where he plays the sports figure in the 70s.  I'm not even going with it. 
[00:50:00]  It's the funny hair thing he's got going on.  What was that one?  What was the one with the tranquilizer dart?  Holy crap.  Are you kidding?  Not one?  Old school?  Yeah, he had a scene in old school.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  That's why stunt brains around.  See, his brain.  But that was a perfect example of what he does for the show.  And that's why he's called stunt brain.  Because when we can't think and our brain isn't working properly, well, we have stunt 
[00:50:30]  brains.  Brings in the stunt brain.  You know, I probably shouldn't say this.  I had.  When we interviewed stunt brain, I hated him.  Why?  Well, because he came in with, like, a stunt brain hat and, ugh.  It was his, like, I don't know, his disgusting display of self-promotion.  Yeah.  With stunt brain.  And then he had to tell us that it's copywritten or something.  I'm just like, all right, a trademark.  Sorry.  See, stunt brain working again because I used the wrong word there.  And it's a credit to his talent, though, that we were able to look past that and just go, 
[00:51:00]  all right, we'll look past the stunt brain thing and just based on his merits.  Was it that or the fact that there was only one other candidate and he just graduated from  broadcasting school?  Can I make...  Thank you to CBS for giving us two choices.  Can I clarify something?  But in all fairness, because I don't want this to go.  So, then we got to know Mr. Stunt Brain and I got to be quite honest with everybody. 
[00:51:30]  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  I think he's a fine addition to this radio show.  Yes.  I really do.  Thank you.  At first, you don't make a good first impression whatsoever, but when you get to know you,  you're not a bad guy.  It's a backhanded compliment, isn't it?  Sorry.  Yes, Jimmy?  No, I just misunderstood you because I was texting you.  I thought you said, and you couldn't.  Oh, here we go.  What did I do?  No, no, no.  Because for a minute there, I was so caught up.  I thought I heard, and he had a stunt brain hat, but I'm like, something was... 
[00:52:00]  I misunderstood something.  Oh.  Can you come in with your stunt brain hat?  Sure.  What color?  What color?  He has a bunch of stunt brain hats.  Does he?  Yeah.  That he could buy, and I'm sure he has sold maybe three at this point.  If it's stuck on your head, can we get Sirhan Sirhan to take it off?  I'd love to see him come out of an elevator and have our gentleman friend remove it like  he did that old lady's...  Oh, I know.  Remove your stunt brain hat, Sir. 
[00:52:30]  Well...  Wham-o.  Stuntbrain.com?  What is this?  Stuntbrain.com, so the listeners can enjoy everything that is stunt brain.  Yes.  I was looking for work.  Yeah, I was looking for work.  Hold on.  Can we look at this website?  We have...  What are the photos?  We have blog.  Mm-hmm.  What are you doing?  You're just putting the arrow around the same page.  You're all going somewhere.  He actually does a podcast?  You got photos?  No, that was podcast was audio for somebody who was looking to hear what I did.  Oh, okay.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We're going to... 
[00:53:00]  The stunt brain blog has moved.  And with the what?  He's retired.  He's got a picture of a green shed.  What is that?  That's where you were living in between radio gigs.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, listen.  We got Barack Obama.  He wrapped up the nomination.  You know, anybody that's sane knows that.  Yeah.  And this is what he had to say last night.  After 54 hard-fought contests,  our primary season has finally come to an end. 
[00:53:30]  Because of you,  tonight I can stand here and say  that I will be the Democratic nominee  for the president of the United States of America.  By the way, Ant,  there are white people in there cheering.  Just want to let you know.  Oh, no, I saw.  Okay.  There were a lot.  They put them all behind them.  Yeah.  So as not to scare away the rest of the white folk. 
[00:54:00]  The Democrats are going to vote for him.  What, because he beats stupid Hillary?  What, her supporters are going to run to a Republican  who wants to keep the...  They may just not vote.  At this defining moment,  at this defining moment for our nation,  we should be proud that our party put forth  one of the most talented, qualified field  of individuals ever to run for office. 
[00:54:30]  Huh?  Oh, you and her?  Yeah, what?  Come on.  I'm Chris Simich.  I love the crap they spew.  Yeah, how she's a great American.  Like a week ago,  she was just a fat-legged nudge.  But now she's, you know,  all of a sudden Schwartzkopf.  Years of public service.  You were just calling her  just short of the C word last week.  Yeah.  And then this.  And that is particularly true 
[00:55:00]  for the candidate who has traveled  further on this journey than anyone else.  Senator Hillary Clinton has made history  in this campaign.  She has made history not...  Not just because she's a woman  who has done what no woman has done before.  But because she is a leader  who inspires millions of Americans  with her strength, her courage,  and her commitment to the causes 
[00:55:30]  that brought us here tonight.  Boy, is he talking her up.  Just political babble.  Babble, babble, babble, babble.  He is talking her up.  I don't want to hear the word strength,  commitment, or call.  I don't want to hear her up.  Ever again.  Shut up.  How is she courageous?  Yeah.  She has secret service around her.  She had the courage to stand by  her husband  as he was  getting a...  Exactly.  Look at her awful blue pantsuit.  What kind of strength is that? 
[00:56:00]  That pantsuit outfit.  Oh, enough with her pantsuits.  The courage to do what?  Eat croissants?  Nothing?  All right.  Sorry.  No.  I'll give you one of these.  A little Roland laugh.  Yeah.  That's the best one.  Yeah, that's...  We got...  Ah, whatever.  That's for another day.  Maybe we'll have Roland laugh  for everybody today.  So, is that it?  Pretty much with this Hillary thing?  Yeah.  She's obviously going to, you know,  back out.  She's done. 
[00:56:30]  All right, listen.  Barack's going to be the guy.  And we haven't played this in a while,  but we have to play  the Larry Sinclair thing.  Love Larry Sinclair.  Boy, this guy.  He's a real hoot.  He is a hoot.  What was it?  What's his whole M.O. here?  Well...  H-O.  H-O.  Yes, thank you, Jimmy.  Well, Obama, what?  Admitted that he did  a little of the coke?  Did he admit the coke  or the pot?  In his book,  didn't he admit to... 
[00:57:00]  Sampling.  Sampling, yeah.  He was kind of headed  down that road.  He did a few bumps?  Yeah.  But then, you know...  Did some of that whore bait?  Whore bait.  That's what he called it.  That was a chapter.  Whore bait.  We have a friend  in the radio business.  He can't take credit for that,  but I can't say who says it  because maybe he'll get fired,  but he calls it whore bait.  Yeah.  Oh, Hannity? 
[00:57:30]  He openly calls  the coke whore bait,  and he never leaves home  without it  because you never know  when you could reel one in.  Wow, that's a bold statement  from you.  You're doing like  a blind column there.  Yeah, well, that's how you...  Who's the radio personality?  Well, that's how you're  supposed to do it.  Yeah.  That's all I'll say about that.  It goes out with whore bait.  Bob Edwards?  Bob Edwards.  Probably.  Anything but garlic.  All right, here's Larry Sinclair. 
[00:58:00]  So, if he sampled,  Larry Sinclair's saying,  well, he did more than that.  He did all sorts of horrific things  back there in Illinois.  Ooh.  Here's Larry Sinclair.  We think Larry Sinclair  is full of ass.  Although, Jimmy's not really sure.  I'm not sure  that Larry Sinclair  isn't crazy,  but just truthful  and good at what he does.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people out there  that believe their own lies  to the point 
[00:58:30]  that they're convinced it's true.  Does that make sense?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That's why I think  he sounds so believable  because I think  in his crazed mind,  he really believes this happened.  He thinks this happened.  That's where I'm at with this.  I believe Larry, actually.  I've seen it to the side  of I believe Larry Sinclair.  I'd like to think  he's telling the truth.  Me too.  I'd still vote for him.  Of course you would like  to think that, Ant.  Of course.  Please.  Hi.  My name is Larry Sinclair.  I'm making this video  and posting it on YouTube.  Because that's where you go 
[00:59:00]  with an exclusive YouTube.  Yeah.  Don't call the news  or anything.  Don't call AP.  Don't be on CNN  just blurting this out.  Why don't you email  Breachbart?  Breachbart.  Stupid Breachbart.  Breachbart.  The worst of the worst.  That Breachbart.  You said that he didn't go to,  like, you're acting like  Good Morning America  wanted him.  There wasn't a lot of choices  for Larry Sinclair.  He had YouTube or nothing.  Good point.  CNN would put him on  like Wolf Blitzer  in the Situation Room. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  You think Wolf would have  Larry Sinclair on?  We got to Larry here.  What do you have to say?  Barack Obama  took his  and put it in my  Okay.  And I believe in aliens  and Bigfoot  and the Loch Ness Monster too.  I'm seeing it on YouTube  because of an incident  involving myself  and Senator Barack Obama  between November 3rd  and November 8th  of 1999  in the Chicago,  Illinois area.  The mainstream media  and Obama himself  has done greatly 
[01:00:00]  to prevent this story  from becoming public.  It's done greatly.  During those time periods  in 1999  I met Obama  at an upscale lounge  in Chicago, Illinois.  After having a few drinks  Obama and I  left in my limo  began to drink  Mr. Obama  acquired powder cocaine  for my use  crack cocaine  for his use.  See, I mean  you know  acquired  because you know  crack is all  about the black man 
[01:00:30]  and  Right, right.  He wanted to sound  more refined  and the coke  is for the white man.  Come on.  Why wouldn't he  just get one thing  for both of them?  Yeah.  Because maybe  they both have  different preferences.  One,  I pitch you'll catch  a hundred.  Maybe that's what  Michelle has  whenever he gets  out of line  and goes,  look,  why don't you shut up?  She goes,  Larry Sinclair,  mother...  And then Obama  just goes,  okay, hon.  Yeah.  Whatever you say.  Yeah.  Mr. Obama 
[01:01:00]  acquired  powder cocaine  for my use,  crack cocaine  for his use.  I performed  sex on  Senator Obama  who at the time  was a state  representative  for the state  of Illinois.  Mr. Obama  knows these  allegations  to be true.  I'm challenging  Mr. Obama  to come forth,  be honest,  stop claiming  that his drug use  is limited  to his teenage years.  1999,  you weren't  a teenager.  1999,  you were  a state representative  for the people 
[01:01:30]  of the state  of Illinois.  1999,  I performed  sex on you  in the back  of my limo  as well as  in my hotel room  in Gurney,  Illinois,  two days later.  Gurney.  Oh, I forgot  about that.  Yes.  Right here in Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  Well, take care of it  right here in Gurney.  Oh, what's in Gurney?  Six flags.  Six flags.  Six flags.  Six flags.  Well, it looks like  Larry Sinclair  had how many flags  of fun in it?  Six flags.  Six flags.  More flags,  more fun.  More flags,  more fun,  indeed.  More like two flags  in the back  of a limo. 
[01:02:00]  Jimmy?  Yeah.  There you go.  You get one of those.  And I'll throw in  one of these.  That's a good one.  I performed a  sex on you  in the back  of my limo  as well as  in my hotel room  in Gurney,  Illinois,  two days later.  If you challenge  the authenticity  of this allegation,  I challenge you  to take a polygraph  test as I will  submit to as well.  Yeah, he's right on it.  These allegations  are true  and need to be 
[01:02:30]  told to the public  that the public  decide whether  Mr. Obama  is being forthright  and honest.  Thank you.  When the hell  did this happen?  Oh, we hit it  at the same time.  You got that idea there.  Damn.  How was he going to go with?  I'm Barack Obama  and I approved  this message.  Oh, you were going  to go with?  When the hell  did this happen?  Yeah, well.  How about this?  Oh, my.  Have we contacted  Larry Sinclair?  Yeah, we're trying  to get him on the phone.  How could we not  have talked to this guy  and given him  a lie detector test? 
[01:03:00]  We need Larry Sinclair.  No, supposedly  he did the lie detector test  and I believe  he failed miserably.  Did he?  I believe  that's how it went.  Who gave it to him?  I don't remember.  Probably Zucro?  Whitehouse.com.  Whitehouse.com?  Yeah.  Didn't that used  to be a porn site?  Yes.  Yes.  Hmm.  What is it now?  Ten grand.  Oh, really?  The guy from  Whitehouse.com  sold it  because his children  were getting older  and he didn't want  his kids to think  of him as a smut peddler  but a lot of people  were duped 
[01:03:30]  into going there  not knowing  that the Whitehouse.org  is where you go  for the actual Whitehouse.  Right.  They would go to  Whitehouse.com  and get a face  full of  Slingy.  Slingy.  And how do you  know that, Ant?  The story behind  Whitehouse.com?  Oh, my goodness.  I think I read that  in the paper.  Forget Aristotle  and fuck Socrates.  Here comes  Professor Anthony.  So weird  how the radio station  goes out  right at that point. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, there's a little  static there.  It must have been  a lightning strike.  It's so weird.  Lightning hits the tower  every time that word  needs to be heard  on the radio.  Better than it hitting  our careers.  All right, we're  going to take another  break.  Let's not forget,  we've got Tito Ortiz  coming in at 8 o'clock.  We've got Sean William  Scott stopping by today.  You've got Jeffrey  Ross stopping by today.  Lots of radio to do.  Yes, Jimmy.  I was just pointing  at Stunt.  Why?  I like him.  He wants a hat.  Jimmy wants a Stunt 
[01:04:30]  Brain hat.  I'd wear it.  You'd wear a Stunt  Brain hat?  Why not?  Hat slash portable  Port-A-Potty.  Convenient for those  long car rides.  No need to stop  for the bathroom.  We've got the  Stunt Brain hats.  They even come  with a little strap  you can put around  your thighs so you  don't have to stop  driving.  Also on the way,  I guess we could  talk about the  four-day work week.  That's happening  like crazy now.  We could talk  about these. 
[01:05:00]  Danny says this  audio is great.  Happy like crazy  where with us?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, we're doing  four days this week.  We did four days  last week.  We're on to a nice  little rhythm here.  Lazy slobs.  We've got audio  of two girls  stealing a nine-year-old  girl's Girl Scout  cookie money.  And Stunt Brain  just yelled in the  background.  It's great.  So we'll get to  that next.  Welcome back to  the Opie and  Anthony radio 
[01:05:30]  program here on  your radio.  We're back.  We've got a big  barn burner happening  here.  A lot of laughs.  We've got myself,  Jim Norton.  We've got Opie.  We've got Ant.  Hi.  We've got Iraq.  Jimmy.  We've got stunt  chest.  Why don't you ever  mention Cleveland?  You've got something  against Cleveland,  Ohio?  No, because Cleveland  understands how much  I love them.  And if I start  mentioning them,  I won't stop  talking about  Cleveland. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, I was a little  confused.  Home of the bulging  panties.  I love Cleveland.  What?  The bulging panties?  Yeah.  That's their new  slogan?  Home of the bulging  panties?  It should be.  Cleveland rules.  Every girl there is  endowed wonderfully.  I love Cleveland.  All right.  877-212-ONA.  We've got Tito Ortiz  coming in.  Remember when Tito  came by back in the  day and beat up Steve?  I wasn't here for  that.  Oh, that was a biggie.  I've never done radio  with Tito.  You weren't around for  when Tito and Steve  went at it?  We should put that  video up on 
[01:06:30]  onaradio.com today.  Check it out there,  Jimmy.  It's right there to  your right.  We decided it would  be a great idea to  have Tito fight Steve  and see how long  Steve could last.  And this was extra  giant-sized Steve  back then.  And Steve lasted a  mere five seconds,  seven seconds,  something like that.  Yeah, you said  when they went at it.  How about when  Tito bitch-slapped  Steve?  Yeah.  Put him on the  ground.  Two combatants.  This was a rapist  and a fat victim.  It's a great video.  I haven't seen it 
[01:07:00]  in a long time.  It'll be up on  onaradio.com  later today, okay?  All right.  The Antelini update  before we move on  to the Girl Scout.  There's an update?  Audio, yeah.  I get scared when you  say that and I don't  know what you're  talking about.  You know, we got a  It's called the  Reset, the biz.  You got a lot of  people listening for  the first time right  now.  We started the show  by talking about  Antelini.  Anthony and Jill went  to my brother's  restaurant, FH Riley's.  Yes, last night.  In Huntington Village.  Your brother has a  restaurant?  Where is it? 
[01:07:30]  I don't remember.  All right.  Yeah.  Keith and his  lovely wife.  Keith and his  lovely wife.  We got a picture  from the date up  on onaradio.com.  But basically, they  celebrated their  two-week anniversary.  Yes.  Two weeks.  Any excuse to have  a few belts?  Doesn't it seem like  any excuse?  It's our 17-day  anniversary.  Let's make those  special margaritas.  Right.  Thursday afternoon.  You know, remember  the special margaritas we  had on our fifth date?  Thursday afternoon. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, it's just  unbelievable.  But they celebrated  two weeks of  going out.  Yes.  And they had a  lovely time.  And we also learned  that you're definitely  going down to  Nashville, Tennessee  for the big  country music festival  because you're all  about country music.  You know, it's a  little-known thing  about me.  Whose idea was this?  Yours or hers?  Well, Jill was going.  Right.  And then, you know,  two weeks of bliss. 
[01:08:30]  And now I'm coming  along.  That's how it works  out.  All right.  And why wouldn't I  want to go?  I hear it's a huge  party down there, a lot  of fun.  And I'm all about  fun, Hope.  I'm all about fun.  You're telling me?  Of course.  Well, with that said,  I'm pretty much just  setting up what Tim  just put together for  you.  Considering you're  going down to Nashville  this weekend.  Yes.  O&A Records is proud 
[01:09:00]  to present the all-new  Anthony Cumia sing-along  country hotel.  And after ten rounds  with Jose Crabble, I  lost count and started  counting again.  Just like other  rednecks, Ant knows  country music is  synonymous with one  thing, binge drinking.  It's only half past  twelve, but I don't  care.  It's five o'clock,  wine dancing, cowboy  hats, and passing out 
[01:09:30]  with your head in the  toilet.  Ant goes country.  Drinking bones connected  to the party phone.  The party phone's  connected to the  staying out all night  long.  From the tap room to  the hockey tonk, you can  drink till you puke and  sing along to all  Ant's country favorites.  I grew up, my roots  were based in country 
[01:10:00]  music.  I was a cowboy.  Y'all don't believe that  Ant likes country music?  Well, with a hot piece of  ass like Jill on your  ****, you'd go country  too.  I'm a late fall shooting  double-fisted drinking  son of a gun.  The Anthony Cumia sing-along  country hoedown.  Get yours today.  I'm Anthony Cumia and I  endorse this product.  Were you shaking your  head at Anthony, Danny? 
[01:10:30]  A little bit, right?  It was more at Tim's  production, but a little  bit there.  Wait, Danny, what was  wrong with Tim's  production?  I don't know.  I'll tell you because I  know exactly what Danny  was shaking his head  at.  What?  Resent.  You don't like the  resent?  The resent line is  like...  It's funny, though.  Instead of presents...  Yeah, that's the  ongoing thing with  Tim's...  He didn't take the  pee out.  It changed the  whole thing. 
[01:11:00]  I caught that.  I was like,  Tim's here.  You go.  You don't like that  one, Dan?  Not a big fan.  You don't like the  little wordplay?  Used to drink with  Anthony.  Remember those days?  Yeah, used to.  Yeah, I know.  Aw.  I know.  Still drink at events.  We still have our  events.  Exactly.  You always stand  outside Tatum O'Neill's  house and wait.  Well, she's going to  AA today, so that's  where she went  yesterday.  Yeah, it was good  that she said that  to the press.  That's good.  Way to respect 
[01:11:30]  certain program  traditions.  Is that what you're  not supposed to  say anything?  I don't know.  I don't know.  See, Jimmy won't  even say that.  It's like a secret  organization.  I would say it  because I'm not in  the program.  Yeah, they're very,  very secretive.  Very, very private,  Anthony.  I would never...  You don't just say  AA like that.  I've never said  what 12-step program  I go to, and I  wouldn't.  And it's not to be  private.  It's because what  happens is when you  start...  People start associating  themselves with  certain programs, if  you relapse or you  slip, then all of a  sudden it looks like  the program...  Ah, it looks like  they've failed. 
[01:12:00]  They want no  connection to anybody.  Right.  Any of them.  You know, they  request anonymity at  the level of press,  radio, and film, and  she knows that.  Isn't there only one  12-step program,  though?  No, there's hundreds  of them, literally.  All right, so there's...  So, all right, so  there's AA and then  there's others.  Yeah, they're all  based on the same  12, you know, steps  and...  But they're just  called different  things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, there's...  People have all kinds  of programs they do.  Okay, very good.  With that said, we're  moving on...  I go to a guru. 
[01:12:30]  We're going to play  the Girl Scout audio  in a second here.  We got an update on  that story, but first,  Danny ran in some  audio of Jimmy  Justice.  This sounds like a  Jim Norton bit, but  it's...  Jimmy Justice.  It doesn't sound like  something Jimmy would  come up with.  There's a guy named  Jimmy Justice, and his  job is to destroy  traffic cops, and I  think I love Jimmy  Justice without even  hearing this guy.  I absolutely do.  Because I hate  traffic cops.  Me too.  I think everybody  does.  If you live in New  York City and you  live with one, you  hate traffic cops.  They're not real  cops, by the way. 
[01:13:00]  They are traffic  enforcement, and they  don't carry guns.  They have no real  authority to do  anything.  They're the parking  ticket guys.  They used to be  called...  Meter maids, they  were called.  Meter maids, even  though they're dudes.  They were called  brownies for a while  because they wore the  brown uniform, and  then they were...  Yeah.  And then they were  brought into a division  of the police department,  so now they wear more  of a police-looking  uniform.  Yeah, but you can't  just go running past  that point.  The reason they made  them part of the NYPD 
[01:13:30]  is because a lot of  these guys got spit on  and beat up.  Yeah.  And you're not going  to spit and beat up  a cop, so someone  got the bright idea  we better make them  look like cops, which  I think is complete  BS.  Ninety percent of  these people, and I'm  being kind, are  overweight to the  point of obese and  just bastards to deal  with.  Yeah.  There's a...  I understand, you  know, you're doing  something wrong, you  get a ticket.  That's how it works. 
[01:14:00]  But there's no leeway  with these people  whatsoever.  You can't talk to  them like human beings.  They won't even  acknowledge that you're  talking to them.  You'll sit there.  I've seen mothers  running with, like,  baby strollers going,  look, I'm only a  minute over.  Yeah.  And I, you know, I  was online at the  store.  They don't even look  at you.  They don't even look.  They just look down  and keep writing.  New mothers are  getting, you know,  trying to explain why  they're a minute over  on their meter.  You know, sometimes  you just got to get 
[01:14:30]  people a break in  this world.  Only people with  power cut breaks.  That's why cops will  give you a break  sometimes.  They'll make the  turn you shouldn't  make and they know  when you're lying  because they have  an intuition.  But they, because  they have real power.  That's what I'm  saying, yeah.  Yeah.  These guys don't  have intuition.  They're just these  wannabes.  They're wannabes.  They want power and  respect.  They want to have  the authority, but  they're sitting there  with a little yellow  vest on directing  traffic.  And if you've ever  noticed, I've never  seen traffic screwed up  so badly as I have 
[01:15:00]  at an intersection  where these clowns  are directing  traffic.  Well, they don't  know what the hell  they're doing half  the time.  One of my favorite  pictures, and maybe  we could repost it on  onaradio.com.  We had a pretty  serious blackout here  in New York City a  couple summers ago,  or maybe more than a  couple at this point,  three or four.  And there's a picture  that someone took of  a civilian directing  traffic at a traffic  light.  And in the same  picture is one of  these traffic enforcers  giving a parking  ticket.  Yeah.  Ticketing somebody. 
[01:15:30]  In the same picture.  Like, thanks.  Like, way to, you  know, understand  responsibility.  You know, no one  knows when to go  because there's no  traffic light.  So a civilian with,  I think, a briefcase  and a business suit is  directing traffic.  Well, this guy, like,  gives a parking ticket.  I've talked to a lot  of police officers also.  These traffic cops,  they're supposed to,  when they get into  any kind of trouble,  an altercation or  whatever, they pick up  their radio and they're  supposed to call for  an officer to come down  and assist them, a real 
[01:16:00]  cop to come down.  And I've spoken to a  lot of cops and they  say, oh yeah, we hear  those calls.  And we take our time.  And they laugh and go,  yeah, we either take our  time or say, sorry,  we're busy.  No one wants to help  these people.  I could speak for this  city.  It's an embarrassment  to the NYPD that  these things wear the  same uniform.  Wear a similar  uniform.  Or it looks like,  well, to the average  person, it looks like  the same uniform.  It really does.  With that said, we've  got some audio of  Jimmy Justice.  What's this about,  Danny?  Well, there's this guy. 
[01:16:30]  Jimmy Justice?  Jimmy Justice.  He's a video camera  guy?  Yes.  He runs around with  a camera and he  catches traffic cops  breaking traffic laws.  He's a great guy.  And confronts them  about it.  Good.  Oh, this is great.  Good for him.  A man calls himself  Jimmy Justice and he,  yeah, okay, what  Danny said.  Here we go.  This one is him  catching a guy doing  an illegal U-turn.  You made an illegal  U-turn in a business  district.  Don't do that.  You made an illegal  U-turn in a business  district and I have it  on video.  Don't do that.  What kind of example  are you for the  citizens of New York? 
[01:17:00]  You're a police  officer.  You're not supposed to  make a U-turn within  a business district.  Can you get out of  my face?  You're not allowed to  make a U-turn in a  business district in  the city of New York.  You violated the law.  You're supposed to.  Come on, arrest me.  I don't have the  authority to arrest you.  But I have the authority  to videotape you, call  3-1-1 and file a  report against you.  Call him.  Call him.  I will.  Call him.  Call him.  Because I have it all  on video.  Call him now.  You're supposed to  enforce the law and not  violate the law.  Get out of my face.  I'm going to get you a  message.  For what?  You videoed me and I 
[01:17:30]  said don't do it.  I videoed you breaking  the law.  I said don't video me.  You're the one who  broke the law and not me.  Why are you mad at me?  I love this guy.  Jimmy Justice rules.  I love this guy because  it's the same crap these  things do to the people  out there.  Oh yeah.  Listen to what a  belligerent slob she is.  Yeah.  First of all, she's a fat  pig.  She's a mess.  And yeah, listen to how  just she could do it.  Get out of my face with 
[01:18:00]  the camera.  Get out of here.  Instead of saying like  yeah, you know what?  You're right.  I really shouldn't be  doing that like and  making yourself what a  belligerent slob that  that's who they're hiring.  Good.  I love Jimmy Justice.  Illegal U-turns to catch  citizens doing illegal  things.  That's that's wonderful.  We got one more.  You got to get a million  of these clips.  Yeah, I'm going to try to  get more of this guy.  We got one more traffic  cop won't give her.  Oh, is this the same  situation?  Yeah.  Same same cop.  Same situation.  OK.  You want to call  one nine.  One one.  You want to call him?  You want to call him? 
[01:18:30]  Let me see your badge  number.  No.  Yes.  I want your badge number.  Call him.  I want your badge  number.  You made an illegal  U-turn in New York  City.  You're supposed to  enforce the law  and not violate the law.  You want me to call him?  Now you're going  dropping your radio.  You're a boob.  You want to call him?  You're a boob.  Do you want to call him?  I will call him.  I want your badge  number and I will  file a 3-1-1 report  against you.  You forgot something.  Hello?  You forgot something.  Step out my face.  OK?  Don't make illegal  U-turns in New York  City.  I asked you to  step out my face.  I asked you not to  make illegal U-turns 
[01:19:00]  in New York City  within a business  district.  I am Jimmy Justice  and your days of  running around this  city like a cowboy  are over.  Get Jimmy Justice  on our show.  And he's a complete  ass.  Jimmy Justice is  just...  She left her  pocketbook behind.  Yeah.  You're a boob.  He called her.  She dropped your  radio.  You're a boob.  Because real cops  walk around with  their pocketbooks.  And she wouldn't  give her badge number.  Who is she to not  give her badge number  to a citizen?  Oh, get Jimmy Justice  on the phone, please. 
[01:19:30]  Someone contact Jimmy  Justice.  The video's terrific.  It'll be linked to  onaradio.com.  Oh, Jimmy Justice  is my favorite.  I'd live with him.  We'll get more of  his clips on the  air in the near future.  Danny, you can't just  bring us one of them.  We'd like 1,700 of  them.  Yeah, we'll find  another one that works.  We'll have more  Jimmy Justice later on  in the show, okay?  Yes.  Do you have audio  of this Girl Scouts?  Yeah.  What do we...  I don't know.  Stump Brain, I'm going  to need you on this  one.  What is this about?  This is from 
[01:20:00]  West Palm again,  just like the  punching DJ was  yesterday.  This little girl  was set up outside  a supermarket  selling Girl Scout  cookies, and these  two idiots decided  to take the money.  How old was she?  The little girl,  she was like 9 or 10.  And they were...  17.  Okay.  And the news crews  came out after they  were caught, and the  girls were not  repentant at all about  what they did, and it's  pretty amazing how they  were on TV admitting  what they did.  Okay.  With that, here it is.  We needed some money. 
[01:20:30]  That's Jimmy.  No, no.  Okay.  We needed some money.  We saw a girl selling  Girl Scout cookies.  We saw an envelope with  money in it, and I grabbed  it, and she drove away.  We aren't showing their  faces, but these two teens  had no problem bragging  about their crime to our  cameras.  Money's money.  I mean, I feel bad it  was a 9-year-old girl,  but there was $150 in  that envelope, and I  wanted that money, and  it was mine.  But after admitting to  stealing Gracie Smith's 
[01:21:00]  cookie money in front of  this...  Little Gracie Smith?  Whoa.  Whoa, Gracie.  Whoa, Gracie Smith just  trying to sell some  cookies.  Yeah, devil's advocate.  First of all, is little  Gracie Smith paying taxes  on that money?  Does little Gracie Smith  have a permit?  Oh, we got Jimmy Justice  right here in the studio.  That's right.  Little Gracie Smith has  been running roughshod  through that area for  years selling her stolen  cookies.  Selling her wares.  Little Gracie Smith is a  crook.  You don't like the little 
[01:21:30]  mint chocolate chip  cookies?  I despise them.  Little Gracie Smith was  specifically told to have  a calorie count, and she  doesn't have it.  Little Gracie Smith is a  crook and a fat seller.  I want some s'mores.  Yes, get me some  s'mores, Gracie.  I'll report you.  Better business girl.  Tired of her skating  through life.  Is little Gracie selling  us trans fats?  She certainly is.  Little Gracie Smith is a  junk peddler.  I love her.  Sean's doing an interview. 
[01:22:00]  Sean William Scott is on  Channel 11, and he'll be  on our show right after the  interview.  That's how it works.  I wish it was Jill  interviewing him, and they were  flirting and laughing.  Hey, shut up.  You have to sit there and  take it.  Don't be in cuckold show.  Cuckold.  They're calling you Jimmy  Jackass instead of just  Jimmy Jackass.  Call me what you want, but  you know what?  I'm not a tax cheat like  little Gracie Smith.  I like saying, call me  whatever you want.  Just don't call me late for  dinner.  That's the best joke ever,  because the horrible, call me  late for supper. 
[01:22:30]  Supper.  How terrible he's said.  I think the Girl Scout  cookie selling thing is a  racket.  Pretty much in the same  way the 25-year-old guys  that are selling the candy  so they could go to a  basketball camp.  Oh, that's scam.  Wow.  A basketball camp?  You got a court right  outside of your apartment.  What's camp?  Are you tense?  Stop it.  What is it really?  Camp?  So they could go to the  big tournament in Florida  or something?  Yeah, I always ask to see 
[01:23:00]  their school library card,  and I'll buy the whole box.  Do you really?  Yeah, and then they chase me  down the block.  Of course they do.  Oh, they do.  All right, let's go back  to Lowell Gracie and what  happened to her.  Let's see your library card.  That's really funny, though.  That is a good one.  A way to get shanked.  Kind of what Mark Parenteau  asks.  All right, guys.  Yeah.  Linger longer.  Maybe Jimmy Justice could do  a little something on the  guy selling the illegal candy.  But after admitting to  stealing Gracie Smith's  cookie money in front of 
[01:23:30]  this West-Hypaluxo  Winn-Dixie, the two Park  Vista students are flaunting  their freedom.  I'm planning on buying  like a necklace and all  this stuff and a new  phone, but now I guess not.  Now the only thing these  teens are buying is time.  The crime is a misdemeanor.  Petty theft.  And a deputy did not...  Wow, that should be hours  of jail time.  Yeah, who are they screwed?  Whoa, whoa.  The reporter right on top of it.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, is she talking  about Gracie Smith and how  she was standing there  unauthorized selling a product 
[01:24:00]  in front of another  establishment?  You want to get to the  brass tacks?  Hate this kid.  I guess not.  Now the only thing these  teens are buying is time.  The crime is a misdemeanor.  Oh, boy.  Gracie on the RICO Act.  He did not witness it.  So authorities have to wait  for the state attorney to  file charges.  Why did you do it?  Um, I mean, who doesn't  like money?  I know it's a crime, but  it was an easy crime.  Just stealing from a nine-year-old.  I got to give it to her.  It is pretty easy to steal 
[01:24:30]  from a nine-year-old.  Yeah, if you're going to  like do some of that  crime stuff, yeah.  Yeah, nine-year-olds got  money like that?  You don't even have to  punch them, and if you  had to, they're down in  like one punch.  Yeah, you're not going to  steal from the drug dealer  uptown.  That's a little too scary.  That's dangerous.  You got to go right with  the nine-year-old thing.  The nine-year-old's not  going to pull a piece out  on you.  By the way.  Just smack him around.  I just saw a headline  on this story.  That's how the cookie  crumbles.  That's how the cookie  crumbles.  Crumbles, I'm John Montone.  Now, this next clip, this 
[01:25:00]  next clip will make a lot  of people laugh, and it'll  also piss people off at the  same time.  That's the beauty of this  radio show.  Is this, uh, it's labeled,  oh, I just wondered if it  was Gracie the thief.  It's labeled, she's pissed.  She should have been able to  keep the money since she was  charged with the crime.  It looks like they already  have a confession on tape,  but Gracie should not expect  an apology.  I'm actually pissed because  I should have kept that 
[01:25:30]  money if they charged me  with all the charges I just  got.  Do you have any remorse  about stealing from a  nine-year-old girl?  Right now, no, because I'm  kind of pissed because I have  charges and we need to give  the money back anyway, so now  I'm pretty pissed.  Like, I don't feel sadness  for that little girl.  I mean, she's getting a lot of  money right now from people  who feel bad for her, so  whatever.  Oh, God, I...  These little bitches.  I just wish these two girls  take up biking in Mexico.  Ooh. 
[01:26:00]  Are these them right there,  right, Iraq?  Oh, yeah, white trash.  Is that it?  Let me take a look at her.  Sexy.  You got a bit of the white  trash going on.  What, Iraq?  They blurred the face.  I can kind of see it, though.  Yeah, you just squint,  and you can see through the  blur.  That's all you have to do.  Squint when they pixelate  something, you see it.  Look, I got the face.  All you have to do is squint.  I totally see her face from  here.  Oh, my God.  They're doing a minimal  pixelation on purpose.  Yeah, but if you squint,  the pixelation goes away.  I didn't know that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's why certain parts of  the world, there is no  pixelation. 
[01:26:30]  I get it.  What's the update there,  Stunny?  The update is one of the  girls was set free, and the  other one faces up to three  years in juvie, but just this  week, the same girl was  caught running out of a  Denny's on a $28 bill.  Oh, she doesn't have money.  Oh, and I would do good  with her.  These chicks are just...  Oh, I'm filling up  looking at her.  You like that?  Oh, please.  If she'll do that for $28.  That girl, there's another  one?  Yeah.  The blonde right there?  That's the one who ran. 
[01:27:00]  She looks like somebody.  What does she look like?  Paris Hilton.  Guess what she'd do for  $150?  She'd run out on the bill.  She'd steal from a nine-year-old.  It's $200.  I bet you give it $200, you're  in.  That's right.  How old are they?  $17.  $17.  All right, well.  It's legal.  Some states.  Some states.  I don't go there.  Let's get the chart.  We do have the chart.  How low can you go?  All right, we got Tito Ortiz  coming in in a few minutes.  Is he here yet?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  Can't make him wait.  He's a savage.  We're not going to make him  wait.  He's a savage.  He comes right in. 
[01:27:30]  He's walking through the  console out the window.  He comes right in.  What do we got there, Steve?  Oh, yes.  The perfect timing, Steve.  Thank you.  We can't go a day without  an Anthelini update.  What?  We got a brand new  Anthelini update.  God, people are getting  so mad.  This is Sam and Derek.  Just when you thought all  the news that could have  happened already did, we  have more juicy information  on the Long Island power  couple known simply as 
[01:28:00]  Anthelini.  The two recently celebrated  their two-week anniversary.  Yes, two weeks.  Into a relationship.  It was our two-week  anniversary.  After spending last  weekend in Boston, the  jet-setting Long Island  rubbish duo are heading  to Nashville, Tennessee  for the CMA Music  Festival.  What am I doing?  You're going?  We are going to go to  Nashville.  Right.  And watch the Nashville  bar scenes.  We're going to hang out  and drink in Nashville.  I got probably three to  four hours into the night 
[01:28:30]  before Anthony's on stage  singing with a variety  of hillbots.  The two are continuing  their hot and heavy  unapologetic make-out  sessions in public.  Rumor has it they may be  making out all the way  to the altar.  We'll keep you informed  with all the schmoopy updates  from Anthelini.  Hello.  Welcome to the Opie and  Anthony show.  Whip them out Wednesday 
[01:29:00]  edition.  I haven't even spoken about  that.  You get your wow sticker on  your vehicle or just put  wow in the dirt on the back  of your truck.  Who cares?  As long as it's visible.  And then girls that are  familiar with this very  program will drive by.  They'll see it and go  oh I know what this guy  would like.  A little treat on his  long commute home.  And then she pulls up  next to you and lifts her  shirt up and shows you  her goodies.  And you're just sitting  there going what the hell 
[01:29:30]  happened?  And then you realize oh  yeah I was just wowed.  And that's how it works.  It's as simple as that.  So get the wow on your  car, truck, whatever the  hell you drive and join in  on the fun.  And I wait for you.  Ooh.  With or without you.  He's crooning.  With or without you.  You. 
[01:30:00]  I just want these songs to  start.  Yeah.  When is this song going to  start?  I never do.  Why?  I do an AT&T brings me  online.  Oh boy.  What happened Jimmy?  What happened?  You were in a good mood.  Yeah.  Just trying to check  something online and  once again AT&T.  Trying to check online on  your phone.  Your iPhone.  You like your iPhone.  I do.  I just hate AT&T.  The iPhone itself is an  amazing piece of technology.  Mm-hmm.  Tito has just arrived and  Steve is fluffing him. 
[01:30:30]  So whatever that means.  Wait a minute.  So Tito Ortiz will be in  here in a minute or two.  I don't know what that  means in the business.  Well the guys are basically  just he's probably giving  Tito some boring speech.  Do you remember when you  beat me up?  Oh yeah.  He's probably saying that.  They're probably going to  raise that up.  You know.  Steve do you remember the  band Foundry?  Remember the song Pendulum?  Instant feedback.  A lot of good ones today.  Did you just? 
[01:31:00]  Jimmy.  I hope you got that down  the hall.  I just mumbled an F-bomb  into the mic so dump.  Oh yeah.  That was a good one.  That was fine.  I just got the message  and stopped responding.  Oh don't bite your  iPhone.  Yeah don't bite it.  An eye tooth phone.  Instant feedback is very  good today.  We got a lot of good ones.  Rum Runner from  Whack Bag writes  May Anthelini be blessed  with clear skies and an  unobstructed highway to  love. 
[01:31:30]  Look at that.  That's nice.  Army Guy from  Charlotte writes  Jimmy.  Girl Scouts is a  non-profit organization  only 50 cents of each  box sold goes to that  girl's troop and the  rest goes to the  cookie company.  Exactly.  So exactly.  What is she doing?  She's out there.  She's selling for the  cookie company.  She's probably getting a  cut on the side that no  one knows about and  that's not being  declared.  Yeah.  Right.  I don't know.  Grace is a tax cheat.  Just sell them outside  out of the back of a  truck.  You got something on  your lip.  I don't want Tito to  see it.  Where? 
[01:32:00]  What?  What?  A little egg.  What?  Gone.  I'm going to put  egg white all over  my lips when it  goes in.  So tell us about  your book.  It's all disgusting.  Right.  Freddie from  Jamaica Station  writes, whoa, what  happened now, Jimmy?  Nothing.  Why would I want to  get a phone that  does that?  Talking about the  Girl Scout situation  we just had before the  break.  He writes, that girl  needs a bowling pin  jammed up her gargoyle.  And then you got  Ethan from PA writes,  are these two girls  from Mastic?  Hmm.  I don't know. 
[01:32:30]  And also, someone is  correcting me.  Rich from Manhattan  writes, Opie, the song  is Linkin Park's  Shadow of the Day,  which I love.  I love that song.  Yeah.  But I think you two  needs to sue Linkin  Park because it sounds  exactly like with or  without you.  It did.  I thought you were  just goofing.  I didn't think it was  with or without you,  but I thought you were  just goofing around  because it did sound so  much like it.  No, I really thought how  we cut that loop that it  was with or without you.  What happened, Steve?  I'm going to go.  Well, how come he's  not in already?  Yeah, what's going on? 
[01:33:00]  Why are you whispering  to Sam?  How long has he been  here?  Yeah, what's up?  Five seconds.  Okay.  Ooh.  Ooh, he just talked.  Three, two, one,  a bit harshly.  I don't care.  877-212-O-N-A.  It sounds very much  like with or without you,  right?  Yeah, it does.  Yeah, just like Sunday  bloody Sundays is a rip  off of Sabbath bloody  Sabbath.  We've been through this.  We've been through this.  That's a stretch, yeah.  I'm not with you on  that one, Jimmy.  No, it was Sabbath when  I mentioned it to them.  That's true.  Okay, at least you  acknowledged it.  Even Sabbath wasn't 
[01:33:30]  with you.  Some songs are, you  know, a common thread.  Sure.  Should I bring him in?  No, it's not.  No, let's just sit here  awkwardly and wait.  Exactly.  I can't get into a new  subject, really.  No.  Because we're waiting for...  We've got an hour and a half  before we get to the  green room where they  have it built on the  other side of the building  now.  It's all, you've got to  take a path train to get  to the stupid green room.  They allowed these creeps  from CBS FM to take over 
[01:34:00]  the green room, and we  still have a green room,  but it's on the other  side of this floor.  Why don't you get the  creeps and put them in  that green room on the  other side of the floor?  Exactly.  Build a studio there.  So we don't need to see  them doing their oldies  breaks.  Are they going to put a  window in there so we can  look at them?  What's up, Tito?  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Tito Ortiz.  Do you remember us?  There he is.  Back in the day.  How are you, sir?  Good, man.  Oh, my God.  Shake his hand, Jimmy.  You're going to be done.  How you doing?  Is that a big hand, you  think?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  That's ridiculous.  Sit down comfortably on  the couch so we can grill  you.  Oh, yeah.  Very comfy.  That's what I like to see.  Now, Tito, we haven't had  you back since the day back  at N.E.W. when we had you  beat up Steve.  Elvis Sinisek.  Huh?  When I fought Elvis Sinisek.  Oh, that was the fight you  were promoting back then?  Yep.  You remember taking out Steve?  Yeah, we actually just  talked about that.  That's a huge conversation  whenever I go to radio.  It's kind of funny.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's actually the second  person I did that to.  First person was Joey Grande, 
[01:35:00]  but it wasn't takedowns.  He wanted to get choked out.  Right.  Oh.  We didn't want that.  Yeah, no, I choked him  unconscious because there  was like big boy and  everybody on the West Coast,  of course, they're like,  let's see what happens  after you get choked out.  I choked him out in about  six seconds because that's  how long it usually takes  to stop the blood flow.  And he was out and he woke up  and he's like,  that's the weirdest feeling  I ever felt in my life.  Oh, can we do that today  with Pat Duffy?  No, no.  What?  No?  No.  Joey Grande is a really,  really good friend of mine.  I go out with him all the time  and stuff and he knows. 
[01:35:30]  No, we don't want to do that  on a radio here.  You never know what happens.  What would you say to your friend,  look, could you just choke me  until I can't breathe  for a little while?  It was for radio,  so you can say the same thing  as you guys coming in here  and doing it for the takedown.  But that was different,  though.  That was right before a fight,  so that was a huge difference.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to repost  our video of you choking out Steve  and getting him in.  Well, he took him down  pretty good.  In a submission hold, yeah.  And how many seconds  did he last, Steve, you know?  12.  12 seconds?  Wow.  12 seconds, that's not bad.  That included Tito's ride  up in the elevator, though.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  I said like 10 seconds.  Lasting that extra two seconds,  I guess you've got to give him props.  Yeah.  The video will be up  on onaradio.com.  So you wrote a book there, Tito, huh?  Yeah, man.  My life story.  Let me tell you.  It's called This Is Gonna Hurt.  It's an interesting story, you know?  It's not really that much  about fighting.  It has a little bit,  you know, a couple chapters  about fighting,  but mostly it's about  my life childhood of growing up,  you know, growing up on the streets.  My parents were ex-heroin addicts.  You know, I went through  a really, really tough time  as a kid from the age of six  to about 13.  So it's a really interesting book. 
[01:36:30]  Very inspirational  from when I started doing,  you know, wrestling  is what saved my life,  you know, growing up.  You know, my mother  separated from my father  and I came back to Huntington Beach  with my three brothers  that they actually left  with a guardian  and went back.  And then from that point on,  it was just,  I got into wrestling.  I got into wrestling.  It saved me pretty much  because, I mean,  I was out of using drugs.  My mom was away from my father  who used to be a drug user also.  And I got into wrestling  and that's one thing  that pushed me  to the next level 
[01:37:00]  of being better  and better and better.  I mean, I graduated high school,  went to junior college.  I mean, in between there  and in the book,  of course,  there's a lot of little stories  of what happened,  you know, ups and downs,  of course,  and then having a chance  to fight in the UFC  for the first time  as a complete amateur  because I was a college wrestler.  Right.  And stopped again  in 22 seconds  and from that point out on,  it just seemed like  a champion was born,  you know.  I got to tell you,  I just turned to the middle  of the book  and you got some great pictures  in here.  Yeah, absolutely.  I love a book  with a middle section  with a lot of pictures.  Yeah.  And the first picture  I see is your dad. 
[01:37:30]  It's your parents, actually.  Tito's parents, Samuel.  Yes.  And Joyce.  Yes.  Hard at work  taking the leaves  off marijuana plants.  Yeah.  Well, my dad used to grow plants.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  I mean, they're like 100% hippies,  you know, so I mean.  So they were growing  marijuana plants  while you were growing up?  Yeah, of course.  Obviously.  In the 70s, I mean.  Yeah, but where were they growing it?  In the house?  No, outside?  I mean, this is back  when they really didn't  pay attention to it.  I mean, in the 70s,  in California,  I mean, that stuff,  it was nothing, you know?  It threw everywhere. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And your dad has  the greatest afro  I've ever seen.  Yeah, actually,  he was on the US magazine  at the US Festival.  Really?  And he was like  far away in one of the pictures  and you'd see his bro.  It's kind of funny,  really funny.  I'm real.  Anthony had an uncle  that used to grow pot plants.  Yeah, back in the 70s,  he would grow pot  in the backyard.  And Ant's mom thought  he was growing basil.  Yeah, well, he told her  that it was a basil oregano  hybrid.  And my mother bought it.  She believed it. 
[01:38:30]  So my father came over  and said,  why is there pot  growing in the backyard?  No, Joey, you idiot.  It's a basil oregano hybrid.  And, well,  they didn't get along  anyway.  It didn't matter.  It didn't matter.  There's a photo of you  in the book  in Japan  with Liddell  and his brother.  That was back  when we weren't friends  and we weren't  a part of the team  and we weren't  trained together.  Oh, really? 
[01:39:00]  Well, it's a big story  that how Chuck Liddell  was never my friend  and we never were  training partners  and we never had  a pack or anything.  But you see him there  and he has a punishment sweater  or a punishment jacket on.  Oh, so, yeah.  He and him  were the first team punishment.  So it's kind of funny  that all the stuff  that's ever been talked about,  how I was afraid of him  and this and that  is stupid, man.  What happened with  you and Liddell?  I mean, you fought him twice.  Yep, lost twice.  He's won both.  What's happened  with you guys personally?  No, nothing at all.  I see him all the time.  I'm out, you know,  shake hands to you.  What's up, Chuck?  Hey, Tito, how you doing?  I mean, it's no more than that. 
[01:39:30]  I mean, cocktail him  every once in a while.  There's no dislike  between you guys?  No, not at all.  It's business, man.  This is a business  we work in, you know,  and when the fight  comes about,  we get challenging  towards each other  and men should be like that  if they fight each other  in an octagon, shouldn't.  Why is Dana White  the head of the whole thing  giving you all this crap?  You don't even know.  Check this out.  Yesterday, I got a cease and assist  for my book  about the cover page  because it has me  with the UFC championship  belt on it.  Get out of here. 
[01:40:00]  So today is the saddest day  in the sport of MMA  when UFC have to stoop down  and hurt a book  that's been my life, you know.  I mean, I've been the champion  for what, four years  and held on to the title  five consecutive times.  No light heavyweight  has ever done that before.  Right.  And I've been there  11 years with them  and just...  So they're going to make you  change the cover, you think?  Yeah, so those are pretty  much collector's items  right there.  So what's the cover  going to be?  I don't know.  They'll probably blur it out,  I guess.  Oh my God.  Are you kidding me?  So, I mean, 
[01:40:30]  everybody go to all  your bookstores.  The books are pretty much...  They're collector's items,  I guarantee you.  For his first batch  and then they're going  to have to redo...  Yeah, the next print  will have a different cover.  Yep.  So when did it start?  Because he said...  I was surprised  to read this stuff  because I didn't know  what was going on.  He said,  Tito doesn't want to fight,  he's a whiner  and he hasn't won  a significant fight  in years.  It's like, what would...  Who's he to say  that I have never  had a significant fight  in years?  I mean,  has he ever fought before?  Does he not understand  what it is  getting beaten down  and doing the training  we do?  And he doesn't  and it's very disrespectful  the way he is. 
[01:41:00]  And that's one of the reasons  why I'm not with the UFC.  I'm going to somewhere  bigger and better for sure.  I mean,  there's a lot of shows  out right now.  I mean,  Elite XC on CBS.  It's a really big show  and an opportunity  for a lot of fans  in the mainstream  to see the style of fighting.  And you saw Kimbo Slice  take that guy's ear off,  obviously.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  That was a good right hook.  What was that?  His ear just exploded?  Well, actually,  when you wrestle  and you bang your head  against another guy  because of wrestling  and rubbing  and so forth  and it ends up 
[01:41:30]  getting swollen  with liquid blood.  And he was supposed  to drain it  before the fight  and he's like,  no, no,  I don't want it  because I want  to get it infected.  And that's like  the stupid thing.  Wow.  Kimbo trained it for him.  He certainly did.  So when he got cracked  and he got popped  all that blood  just burst.  It's an amazing video.  It looks like his ear  is completely off his head  just hanging there though.  That was vicious.  And what,  you guys have to drain  your ears a lot?  No.  Well,  some people do.  I don't.  I'm lucky.  I mean,  I've been wrestling  for like 17 years now  so my ears are pretty much  banged up as much 
[01:42:00]  as they're going to get.  I'm lucky  I don't have  banged up ears.  I mean,  look at Couture  and it looks like  he has knobs on his ears.  What do you think  of Kimbo Slice?  I think he's a young guy,  actually not an age,  young in the sport  who's maturing  and getting better,  I think.  It just showed  what type of heart  he had to come out  in the second round  after getting beat down  at the end of the first  and take the guy out.  Jimmy turned me on  to Kimbo Slice  with the backyard fights  and street fights  this guy was all out.  He's not at the level 
[01:42:30]  that we are,  I mean,  not yet,  but he's taking it seriously  and he's doing the training  and maybe two years from now  he's real vicious for sure.  It's amazing,  these guys,  because we look at him  because of all those  backyard fights  and we're like,  this guy's an animal,  he'd be terrifying  and these guys are like,  he's cute,  he's coming up,  he's got potential.  You've got to understand,  what we do is  100% of our lives,  I've been doing it  for 11 years,  non-stop,  every single day  pretty much.  And what guys  have been doing  street fighting  and they have been  doing the jiu-jitsu 
[01:43:00]  and the wrestling,  it takes a while  to learn.  What's a guy like that  vulnerable to  in the ring?  Take downs,  chokes,  ground and pound,  I mean,  a lot of things,  just the whole other game.  But what's the danger  about trying to  pull those moves on him?  The danger,  it's,  I mean,  you expect to get punched  at least.  Yeah,  I would gather,  you know,  you don't want to get  hit by that guy.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You've got to get hit  with more than one punch,  that's for sure.  But I mean,  the takedown against  the fence is hugely,  I mean,  that octagon or the cage 
[01:43:30]  is a weapon.  If you know how to use it  and you can use it  to your best,  you can stop a guy  who's a boxer.  Really?  And that's why it's MMA.  It's not boxing.  It's a big difference.  Well,  so he's like more,  he'd be more considered  like a striker,  like Chuck's a striker.  I mean,  But Chuck has college wrestling,  so there's a big difference.  You know,  when you have college wrestling,  it's a lot harder  to take an opponent down.  Yeah.  With Kimbo Slice,  and he doesn't have  college wrestling ability,  yes,  he's wrestling with bigger guys  and so forth,  but it takes a long time  to learn that capacity  of wrestling  instead of short time.  You can't do that.  There's something, 
[01:44:00]  like it's when I fought  Randy Couture  and I lost my title  to Randy Couture.  I lost him by a wrestling match.  He's,  at that time,  I was 28 years old  and he's been wrestling  for 30 years.  So he's been wrestling  longer than I've even been old.  And so it just came down  to a wrestling match  and you can't learn  that different positions  in that amount of time  because it takes so much  to learn.  Such a long time.  Were you ever scared  in a fight?  Every one of them.  Every one of them?  But there's difference.  It's not scared  as intimidated.  It's scared of  what's going to happen.  Making sure you do not 
[01:44:30]  make a mistake.  But it's kind of funny  because right before  I get in the octagon,  there's no fear.  As I'm walking out  and the audience  and everything,  I'm so emotional  that tears come out  and I wonder why.  Why do these tears come out?  And it's in my book too.  I mean,  just the whole feeling  of walking out.  But it was the fear  leaving my body.  And as soon as I stepped  in the octagon  and I started jumping  and I said,  don't stop moving.  Sharks don't stop moving.  Don't stop moving.  And it's fight time.  It's game time.  It's the World Championship finals.  Yeah.  What's your worst fear?  Worst fear?  Being broke. 
[01:45:00]  Really?  100%.  Because that's what  you went through growing up?  Yeah.  Read that book  and you'll see a kid  who's not supposed  to be alive right now.  I'm living the American dream, man.  And people don't understand  what I've been through.  Living in cars  and motels  and garages  and people's backyards  and motorhomes.  I mean,  I went through some serious stuff  as a young kid.  Did you see your parents  shooting up?  Of course.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Smoking and shooting up.  I mean,  they wouldn't do it  in front of me.  I mean,  but like I'd see  when we just live 
[01:45:30]  in a little trailer  and they would shut  the screen  between both of us  and you could see  the reflection  of being cooked  in the spoon  and the noodles  and so forth.  At a young age.  I mean,  I was 12, 11.  This book could be  turned into a movie,  I'm thinking.  Oh, 1,000%.  I've said my story  so many times  and people go,  God,  that'd be a great movie.  There's so much drama  and so much ups and downs  and family problems  and fighting  and wrestling  and little opportunities  I had in my life  where I could have made  a left or a right. 
[01:46:00]  There's one part  of my book  that talks about  when I was,  I believe,  a junior in high school  and one of my friends,  Nacho and Ricky,  we used to go fishing  with every summer.  Summertime was our time  to go fishing.  That was another thing  that kept me away  from gangs was fishing.  I had wrestling  the next day.  He had one of his buddies  call up and said,  you want to come with me  to come drop something off?  And I was like,  I can't, dude.  I got wrestling tomorrow.  He's like,  just come with me, man.  I'll give you like 300 bucks.  Don't worry about it.  Everything was taken  and taken care of. 
[01:46:30]  And I was like,  I got wrestling tomorrow, man.  He's like,  just come out.  If you come out,  I'll give you some loot.  Don't worry about it.  And I was like,  you know,  this wrestling thing  really means a lot to me.  I got to go practice  in the morning.  I can't go.  I'm not going to go.  He goes,  okay, cool, whatever.  I'll call you tomorrow.  Well, I go to school,  finish the next day off.  I get a call from his mom  saying,  yeah, do you hear  what happened to Nacho?  I go, no, what happened?  He goes,  they got arrested last night  with a million dollars  worth of speed,  five assault rifles  and five bulletproof vests.  So what they were doing  is they're going to make 
[01:47:00]  a drop for the Mexican mafia  because I was back  when Southside Huntington Beach  and they would do  all the West Coast stuff.  And it was crazy  because I didn't go  because of wrestling.  I would be in prison  with him right now.  Actually, no,  he just got out.  He just got out  a year and a half ago.  How many years did he do?  Well, I was 18  and he just got out  last year.  I'm 23.  Wow.  15 years.  33.  33.  You said I'm 23.  You said I'm 23.  33, yeah.  That's what I tell everyone too.  So it's okay. 
[01:47:30]  I got to look young.  So you almost did 15 years.  Almost.  Just like that  in a split decision.  Split decision.  And there's so many opportunities.  I mean,  so many different things,  stories and so forth  in the book  that was that same thing.  You know,  I could have made it right.  I could have made it left.  I mean,  another time when I was  on my honeymoon,  first day of our honeymoon  in Bermuda  and we got hit by a bus,  me and my ex-wife.  Jeez.  Yeah,  I got thrown like 20 feet,  road rash all on my left side.  She got caught underneath the bus  and drugged eight feet  and I came to my feet  and I ran over  and I'm like,  told the bus to stop 
[01:48:00]  and scream  and I went to go grab her  and I mean,  I went to college  so I took first aid  and so forth,  you know,  not to grab a victim  from the ground.  I grabbed onto her  and one of the ladies  goes,  stop,  don't touch her.  I was like,  oh yeah,  I let her back down.  I took a step back  and I almost passed out  and ambulance took us away  and the terror  and the fear  you got in your heart  when you see someone  who you just married  underneath the bus  and I mean,  and I got hit hard,  I was getting locked,  I was knocked out,  dazed at my feet.  I mean,  it was really serious 
[01:48:30]  something that happened to us  and it's all in that book.  There's so much good stuff.  Yeah,  I mean,  you guys hear these stories,  I mean,  there's so much good stuff  in the book.  You were just crossing  and what was your moped?  No,  actually I was on a moped  in Bermuda  and they show on the hotel channel  that,  oh,  ride your mopeds around,  it's so beautiful.  Oh,  it's easy  and we went  but it's on the opposite  side of the road  and when you come out,  I mean,  here in the United States  you pull out  and you look left  to turn right.  Well,  there you got to look  right to turn left  and I look left  pulling out  and bam, 
[01:49:00]  bus hit us  about going  about 30 miles an hour.  Yeah,  when you go on vacation  your brain doesn't work  that way.  You try.  Yeah,  I try.  You try your best.  We drove around all day.  Yeah,  we drove around all day.  But you spend your whole life  knowing it this way  and on vacation  you're supposed to think  completely opposite.  It was a two-way stop  at a three-way intersection.  Whoa.  It is.  So do you consider lucky  that you were able  to get yourself together  and out of that situation  and become as successful  as you are?  Very,  very lucky.  I'm not done yet at all.  Not even close. 
[01:49:30]  You know,  when I started this fighting thing  it was just the beginning  I think.  Right.  And it's turned into  bigger and better things.  I mean,  I had my clothing company  Punishment Athletics  that I started.  I mean,  it was new back then  when I first came on here  but in 99  when I started it  now it's a multi-million dollar company  and I started with $500  out of my pocket  and I just put my heart  and soul into it.  You know,  the designs,  everything,  hats,  t-shirts,  beanies.  I mean,  everybody go to  Punishment.com  check it out  and I just made it  just as a family company.  Me and my ex-wife  are owners with it.  Me and my ex-wife  are best friends. 
[01:50:00]  Anthony,  you hear that?  Wow.  No,  I'm lucky.  I'm really lucky  and her and my girlfriend  are best friends also  so it's even cooler.  I have a son with her,  Jacob,  who just turned six last week  and...  So the girls get along?  Yeah,  dude.  You don't even understand  I'm so lucky.  That's so weird.  Yeah.  You don't get threatened by it?  I'm like,  do we have you  for a few more minutes  or are we going to...  Yeah,  we can take a break  and get into that.  Okay.  I want to know about  your parents  and how they're doing.  Yeah,  for sure.  And I actually want to ask you  about the first time  you ever fought.  For sure.  I'm sure that's a very  vivid memory 
[01:50:30]  and I'm sure you were  really young,  I'm imagining.  Yes,  22.  Okay.  Well,  no,  I mean...  Street Fight.  First time you ever fought,  yeah.  Okay,  I got a good one actually.  All right,  good.  We'll get into that next.  Opie and Anthony.  Awesome.  Wow.  Awesome,  dude.  For the people out there  whipping out Wednesday,  you know the deal,  I hope.  Get a wow sticker,  get flashed,  get happy.  The power of Christ  compels you!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Welcome back  to Norton and Friends. 
[01:51:00]  We've got Tito Ortiz  in the studio.  Yeah.  Simone's book is called  This Is Gonna Hurt.  And not the first day  it's out,  it's been out for like  two days.  So there's a book signing  tonight,  7 o'clock here in New York City,  Virgin Megastore,  it's in Union Square,  which is 52 East 14th Street.  Everybody knows  where Union Square is.  That's a great location  to go to a book signing  because you can get there  from anywhere in the country.  It's gonna be a good one.  You gotta hurry up  and come out and get them  because there's not gonna be  no more left with UFC on it.  Yeah, there's some controversy. 
[01:51:30]  Tito's gonna have to  change the cover  because he's wearing  a UFC belt.  Yeah.  And they're having  a problem with that.  They said that I'm selling books  because I have the UFC belt.  I've been the longest  reigning UFC champion  they've ever had.  And I don't get the right  to wear a belt that I want.  It's just horrible.  I don't know ultimate fighting  like Jimmy, certainly,  but I know you.  Right, exactly.  You know?  I know you and Chuck Liddell  and I could probably  name a few others  but you're like right there.  You're at the top. 
[01:52:00]  I've been there longer  than anybody's ever competed.  And it sounds like  you wrote a good book,  The Life of a Mixed  Martial Arts Champion.  This is gonna hurt.  And we learned that  your parents were doing  heroin in front of you  and had some major issues.  How are they doing now?  Really, really good.  You know, I'm actually  I went through about  six years not talking  to my dad  when my son was born.  It's just a lot of  hatred towards him  and you know,  it's just so much stuff  that I dealt with.  But my mother,  actually,  I've talked to  every single day  pretty much  and you know, 
[01:52:30]  she's doing really,  really good.  I seen my dad  probably about six months ago  before I fought  my last time.  I just fought  two and a half weeks ago.  And I really got a chance  to sit down  and talk to him.  You know,  I was having a lot  of nightmares and stuff  and just asking him  why when we were kids,  why we put us  through the way we did.  And I sat down  and talked to him  and I had to say my piece.  And I told him  that I know I hated him  but I'm willing to  move on in my life  and accept,  you know,  life's too short.  And I told him that  and you know,  he never apologized to me 
[01:53:00]  which, you know,  I just frustrated.  And I told him how,  you know,  I thought he quit  on us as family  and so forth  and, you know,  it was good to talk to him  and get it over with.  And once I got it over with  I was just like,  all right,  I felt 100% better.  Stop having bad dreams.  I felt like, you know,  I faced my enemy  and I said my piece  and, you know,  I talked to him  here and there now.  But me and my mother  are very, very close.  She wrote me a letter  when I was 25  about why it happened,  what happened.  And it really meant  a lot to me. 
[01:53:30]  It meant a whole lot to me.  What was her reasoning  if you want to share?  Well, you know,  my father actually  had a hernia  removal  and the pain  he went through,  he couldn't handle  the pain that  the painkillers  that were giving him.  He couldn't,  it wasn't doing nothing.  He didn't have insurance  to pay for like  better painkillers  as you can say.  So his uncle,  or my uncle,  his brother turned him  on to heroin  at the time  to kill the pain.  Did he ever have a real job  when you were growing up?  Well, that's kind of funny  from like the age 
[01:54:00]  of about five  before that,  we had an awesome life.  I mean,  picket fence,  the whole nine yards.  Oh, no kidding.  He owned his own company,  a cabinetry company.  He did cabinets  for grocery stores  and so forth,  houses and everything.  And it just changed  100% when I got into this.  You know,  it just,  I remember we used  to go to Mexico  and, you know,  on the East Coast,  of course,  Casper Park,  we'd go hunting and stuff.  I mean,  when I was really young,  I remember that.  But then all of a sudden  it just changed completely.  You know,  and you watched  everything go away slowly, 
[01:54:30]  the picket fence,  the house,  and then you were  living in a car?  Yeah,  a car  and a little motor home  that sleeps too.  No real surprises there  with like heroin.  It seems to have fallen.  Yeah, sure.  If it falls into that category,  you're going to lose everything.  But what's interesting  is that they had  pretty much everything  they wanted or needed  and then to watch it  all go away,  I can't imagine.  And quick too.  It's just,  I don't know.  I mean,  I've tried every single drug  I think there is,  you know,  except heroin.  I mean,  there was one time  I, you know, 
[01:55:00]  I had recreational  during college,  high school,  and so forth,  even earlier when,  you know,  we grew up in the  punk rock era  and the West Coast  and I had older brothers  so, you know,  we smoked pot  and drank all the time  and so forth.  But heroin was something  I never touched  because of that.  Is he still using it,  your father?  I don't think so, no.  When I looked at,  when I seen him  and he looked really,  really good,  looked healthy  and everything,  and I seen him  probably about  six years prior to that  and he looked pretty bad.  So, I think he's been  sober for a while.  Well, that's good to know.  And no amends though.  He didn't apologize  or anything?  You know, 
[01:55:30]  no, he didn't.  He listened to me  really well  and, yeah,  he never apologized.  And that's why  I kind of like took it,  like, you know,  I said my piece,  cool,  and he has my number  and everything.  If he wants to call me,  but, I mean,  are you looking for  a super dad all of a sudden?  No.  Sometimes I just gotta go.  Yeah, but I just make sure  he's okay and so forth.  You know,  I think I'm gonna go to his house  and go refurnish his house  for him,  just be nice.  You know,  I walked in  and everything was kind of  old and so forth,  so I made a little money,  so I wanted to help  all the family.  And you're dating Jenna 
[01:56:00]  and I mean,  I know everybody  probably asked you about it,  but my biggest question  with that is,  because I'm so easily  threatened by other guys  and other relationships  from my girlfriend.  I feel sorry for you, dude.  It's awful.  Panic.  His imagination  gets the best of them, right?  Jimmy's told me some stories  and I'm like,  Jimmy,  she's not doing  what you think she's doing.  But even guys  that they've legitimately  slept with,  I automatically,  I always paint myself  as the loser in this scenario.  It's awful.  It's like,  how do you,  all right,  you meet  and obviously  she's probably  the biggest name  in porn ever  and how do you  not allow that 
[01:56:30]  to threaten you?  I just,  when I met Jenna,  she was changing  a different chapter  in her life, you know?  She was getting out  of the porn industry.  I mean,  you were there  when she retired  and so forth  and I just see  a different woman.  I don't see the chick  who was a porn star  and so forth.  I mean,  that was old history,  you know?  Even the last three years  of her business,  she actually just did movies  with her husband  and that was it,  you know?  So,  and the stuff she did  as a young kid,  I mean,  I like the stuff  that I did  as a young kid,  so we live on in our lives.  When I wrote my book,  I wrote a different chapter  and I have a lot 
[01:57:00]  of self-confidence,  100%.  She loves me  and she respects me  and I respect her  and it's just,  we empower each other.  It's weird,  you know?  We live the same type  of life,  same type of growing up  and so forth  as kids  and,  you know,  with no parents  and this and that  and so we have  a lot in common  and we look to each other  to,  you know,  support each other  and,  you know,  it's great,  man.  Like I said,  I've had an ex-wife  who's a best friend  to me now.  They're friends  which is amazing  and,  you know,  and she sees  what Jenna  is just like me.  She goes, 
[01:57:30]  you guys are exactly  compatible  because you guys  have the same story,  the same deal  and we empower  each other,  man,  and it's awesome.  But the pressure,  I mean,  come on.  No,  no pressure.  I mean,  being a guy,  you know,  we all feel that pressure.  I have the hottest  chick in the world.  But to make sure,  you know,  you're taking care  of her needs,  that's got to be,  I can't imagine  the pressure.  For you,  I can imagine.  Sorry for you.  Wow.  I'm a passionate dude,  man.  There's a big difference.  Right on,  man.  I'm a passionate guy  and,  you know,  I know my stuff.  That's what I'm saying. 
[01:58:00]  You're obviously confident  and know you're doing  when I went to college.  More than okay.  You know,  find a girl's G-spot  and so forth like that  and all that stuff.  All right.  I know that stuff,  man.  I heard she was at your fight  when you lost to Chuck  and she was crying  and she was really upset.  Like,  what was that?  This is what I wondered too.  Like,  what was that like afterwards?  Like,  what do you say to each other?  She's very supportive.  Very,  very,  very,  very supportive.  I mean,  and there's times  I can't believe it.  I lost.  She's like,  Tito,  listen,  you didn't lose.  Fans watched you fight.  There's no other men  who can step in an octagon 
[01:58:30]  and do what you do.  I mean,  both you guys are winners.  You want a guy to lose,  you guys are still winners  because average people  do not get in an octagon  and get in a fight.  They don't see the training  you put into it.  You can't be sad at all.  And yeah,  I get hurt for,  you know,  a week or two,  but I suck it up,  lick my wounds  and get back in it.  That's why it's called fighting.  Does she worry about your safety?  Yeah,  a little bit,  but I don't really worry  about my safety too much.  You know,  I'm ready.  I'm trained.  I'm trained to do this.  You know,  it's just.  Are you kind of relieved  that they've changed 
[01:59:00]  some of the rules  to protect you guys  a little bit?  Because when this first hit,  you know,  Arcoch.  That's when I used to fight.  Yeah,  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  When it finally hit,  like,  my radar,  they were,  they were like,  you know,  kind of protecting you guys  a little bit.  But when I first saw it,  I was like,  wow.  There was no really,  there was no real  tapping out or anything.  The real,  you know,  longevity of this sport  has happened  and it's here now  because of the rules  that got into it.  You know,  with boxing,  when they first started,  they didn't have gloves.  Yeah.  They would fight no round.  There was no rounds, 
[01:59:30]  no time limit.  Then as you started  organizing and,  you know,  evolving a sport,  you put those rules,  you put those regulations,  you put those time limits.  And what we've done  in the last,  you know,  11,  13 years that  mixed martial arts  has been around,  it took boxing  100 years to do  just because the athletes,  the levels that they train in.  I mean,  you've got kids now  that have been training  for 10 years  and started when they were  12 years old.  You know,  and they're good.  They're really good now.  It's like,  wow,  these kids are 22,  23 years old  and they're tough as hell.  Yeah.  Couture wants to leave  actually and fight Fedor,  but they won't allow it. 
[02:00:00]  To me,  that's a frightening fight.  Is he going to get hurt  fighting him?  No,  not at all.  Fedor walks around 220.  I mean,  Couture walks around 230.  I mean,  it'll be a great fight.  I think Couture has a huge chance  of beating him  because he's a better wrestler.  And like I said,  this comes down to wrestling.  They had the strikings there,  but I think Couture  could beat him at 230,  no doubt.  I saw him get dropped  on his neck.  Someone picked him up  and dropped him on his neck  and then he got back up.  You're talking about Fyodor,  yeah.  Yeah,  he's a savage.  Wow.  He's just a big,  he's a Russian guy. 
[02:00:30]  No expression on his face,  nothing's doing.  He's vicious, man.  He's actually fighting  on the West Coast,  I believe it's July 19th  with Affliction.  So it should be  an interesting match.  Him versus Tim Sylvia,  I believe,  UFC former champion.  A lot of guys from UFC have left.  You know,  I'm just one of the guys  to follow up behind,  you know.  Couture left,  Tim Sylvia left,  Andrei Oloski left,  I'll be gone.  And you know,  UFC really don't take care  of their guys  because of one person,  the president.  And it's just,  it's really bad. 
[02:01:00]  And it's getting worse  and there's starting to be,  you know,  limelight and the lights  being shown on  because we're hitting  main audience now.  So it's a big,  big,  big difference.  You hit mainstream,  it changes everything.  Go ahead,  Jimmy.  I was saying,  is it going to,  is it like,  because there's other options  now to fight?  Bigger companies coming about,  yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean,  you're on Free Network.  I mean,  how many fans would love  to see Free Network  and not have to worry  about paying people.  The ratings for what CBS did  on,  what was it,  Sunday night?  Saturday night.  Saturday night,  I mean,  we're through the roof.  Yeah,  they did like 12 million viewers.  It was ridiculous.  That's great.  It just shows how powerful 
[02:01:30]  mixed martial arts is.  You said before the break  you have a good story  about the first time  you ever was in a fight.  In a fight.  Yeah.  How old were you?  I was,  I'd say,  11 or 12.  There was this bully guy  that,  and I'm not sure  if this is in the book  because this is the one  that I remember perfectly  because it wasn't like  it was her first fight  and so forth.  It might be in the book.  I'm not 100% sure.  I lived in San Diego  and there was a bully kid  who always used to bully us.  We had a group  that we'd hang around.  He'd bully the guys,  bully the guys,  but no one ever really got hit 
[02:02:00]  or anything like that.  He'd just push them,  shove them,  and so forth,  and one day  he'd try to do it to me  and I stood up to him  and I socked him in the stomach  and he fell on the ground  and started crying.  That kid never bullied me again  and all of a sudden  it seemed like I was going  to be the bully of it,  but I wasn't  and I was cool  to everybody else  and that's how I've always  been to my friends.  I've been very, very respectful  to all my friends  but that bully never picked  on any of us again  because I remember telling him,  man, I'll beat you up again  if you'd be a bully  to any of us.  But that was as a kid.  There was a lot of fights  that happened between  from that point on on 
[02:02:30]  that were very serious  and there have been ones  that guys have had  their lives almost taken away.  When I was young,  I was 16 years old.  This is a great one.  It's not my first time,  but this is a great one.  In Huntington Beach,  they have parades  every 4th of July  and it's like a huge thing,  parade and everyone parties.  I mean, you guys heard  of the riots they had down there  and I believe it was  in 80 or 92, 93  or something like that.  But every year  they have huge parades  and parties  and so forth down there  and they have like group parties.  Well, on the corner, 
[02:03:00]  they'll block off a corner  and have a big party  down there  and so forth,  a block party pretty much  and we're lighting fireworks  and I was throwing  Piccolo Pete's  and this guy came walking me,  an older guy,  mustache, long hair.  He walked up to him  and he goes,  hey, you punk.  Don't be throwing  no more of those fireworks.  I'm all,  did it come close to you?  He's like,  no, but don't be throwing  no more of those fireworks.  I was like,  okay, sure.  Turned around  and walked away  and I was 16, 17  drinking alcohol  and having fun  in Huntington Beach  and I threw another one  and he came up  and he pushed me  and I turned around 
[02:03:30]  and the people  kind of broke it up  and people,  nothing happened or anything  so I went to my brother's house  and we're sitting  on the porch  drinking beers  and my brother Marty  on the right of me,  my brother Jim  on the left of me,  my brother Mike  on the left of him  and like eight  or nine of our friends  and they're all older  and I was the youngest one.  I mean,  these guys are aged from,  you know,  19 to,  I actually know,  22 to 35,  you know,  older guys,  you know,  all big or burly guys  and I'm sitting there  and all of a sudden  a guy hops out of the car  in front of the house  and he goes,  there's that punk right there  and him and two of his buddies 
[02:04:00]  jumped out  and he comes running up  and socks me in the head  and before he socks me in the head,  I know my brother Marty,  I'm all,  that's the dude right there  and I looked up  and pop,  he cracked me in the eye.  Did he see nine guys  sitting there?  I don't know.  What a setup.  What a dope.  Right.  My nose was just,  I was like,  cracked me  and I stood to my feet  and my brother  already hit him once  and he was trying  to get off the ground.  He got off the ground  and I punted him in the face  and when I punted him in the face,  I mean,  I was a young kid,  I was 16 years old  and I didn't know  and I punted his face, 
[02:04:30]  he fell on the ground  and I started stomping his face.  Well,  my brother's girlfriend  at the time,  Christy,  she pushed me off  and goes,  you're going to kill him  and pushed me off  and I had a big old egg  on my head.  I was serious,  I had the biggest black eye  and I remember looking  on the ground  and he was sitting  in a pool of blood  and I took off running  and I went to my house  and my mom and dad  were there  and my mom and my stepfather  were there  and I walked in  and they go,  oh my God,  what happened to you?  I go,  some old guy punched me  in the head.  This guy's probably 
[02:05:00]  about 34,  35 years old  that socked me  and the ambulance came,  took him away  and he was in intensive care  for like four days.  This is really,  really funny.  The reason they did  nothing happen  is everyone said  that he punched  some kid in the head  and the kid  was defending himself  and that got smashed  and everything.  Well,  about six months,  almost a year later,  I was at some party  that was in the same neighborhood  and this guy walks up  and he was like,  yeah,  and he starts saying  this story about  what happened  in Fourth of July  and he was in intensive care  after and he sipped 
[02:05:30]  through a straw  and he like wouldn't  elaborate the story  and I sat back  and I just started listening  and there's 30 people  in the party  and I go,  hey bro.  He goes,  what?  I go,  that was me.  You punched me  in the head.  I go,  you're stupid.  All my brothers  were there  and you socked me.  I go,  that was the dumbest thing  you've ever done  and he had the whitest  ghost look on the face.  Oh my God.  He wanted out of it.  And he left.  He ended up leaving.  Of course.  Yeah,  but that was a great,  I mean,  I was lucky  but that was just a part  where you get that click  in your head  of going,  oh,  I could have a chance 
[02:06:00]  to kill someone  right there  and I know,  I never did anything  like that again.  Would it be great  at the party  if you just walked up  and punched him  in the face  and put him back  in the hospital?  You understand,  I've never been  that type of guy.  No,  but I mean,  just to be silly,  not even to be mean.  Just to kind of  be silly.  Just to kind of  just show everybody  what happened.  Great visualization.  Just to be a silly goose.  Well,  Tito,  it's always a pleasure.  Yeah,  it's been way too long,  man.  Tito Ortiz,  the life of a mixed  martial arts champion.  This is going to hurt  and the book signings again,  Jimmy,  what,  Union Square tonight?  Tonight,  seven o'clock  at the Virgin.  There's a couple of  Virgins in New York. 
[02:06:30]  This is not the one  on Broadway in the 50s.  This is the one  in Union Square,  which is very easy  to get to,  14th Street  here in New York.  You get there  from anywhere,  basically Jersey,  Long Island.  I think anywhere  covers that.  Yeah,  when's your next fight?  Next fight,  possibly in October  or November.  I just lost the decision  to a guy who ran away  from me for three rounds,  which was horrible.  Yeah,  what was that about?  Because someone brought  that up on instant feedback.  The guy just ran  the whole fight?  Pretty much.  And he struck a couple times.  Took me down once  in the third  because I got out of position  trying to chase and grab him. 
[02:07:00]  And then another time  he hit me in the belly  of the gut  and knocked the wind  completely out of me.  And I recovered  which was pretty cool.  Then I caught him  in a triangle choke  and I almost had him.  I was like literally  a half an inch away  and I would have won.  But it happens.  But I think  I lost the fight  which is fine  but I think I won  the battle against the UFC.  I'm a free agent for once.  First time in 11 years  I'm a free agent  and it's huge.  The CBS company  with Elite XC  really want to sign me.  There's other companies  that really want to sign me. 
[02:07:30]  But I think I'm going  to do my own promotion  and co-promote  with another company.  I think that's  the best thing to do.  I've been in the business  for 11 years.  I know a lot of fighters  that they know  that I respect them  and so forth  the payment wise  and everything.  I'm in it for the fighters.  It's about the fighters  because I'm a fighter myself.  How many more years  do you think you'll fight?  Three.  Oh, you already know.  I already know.  36 and you're out.  Yeah, the reason why  I say that  I would love to fight  until I'm 40 years old.  I mean I'd love to fight  until I'm 50 years old  but I have a son 
[02:08:00]  and I just want to move on  to bigger and better things.  I mean the fighting game  has been around  for 11 years now.  I finished three to four years.  I did my 15 year career  in mixed martial arts  and doing movies  is my next step  without a doubt.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, for sure.  I just signed up  with William Morris  at the beginning of the year.  You know there's some money in that.  Yeah, there's a lot of money.  Yeah, and it was just  one of those things.  I came from a really crazy upbringing  so I have so much emotions  for acting that, you know,  it could be in drama  or it could be in action-packed films.  It's just an opportunity.  If I get that opportunity 
[02:08:30]  I will succeed in it.  I mean when I did fighting  I didn't learn it overnight.  Right.  And I succeeded very, very well.  And it's the same type of deal.  You know, I'm not that bad boy  people see in the act again  that wants to kill someone  all the time, you know.  It's an act a little bit  but it's just I train so hard that.  It's nice to have one of these guys  in here and they're smiling, you know.  It's like Chuck Liddell  and a few of the guys  we've had on  they quite frankly  scare the hell out of us  and I know we're friends.  So it's nice to have  someone smiling  as they talk about  beating someone up.  Chuck's idea of laughing  is he basically  he'll just breathe  and kind of nod. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  All right, well that means  he's happy.  He's like a bull.  He has all kinds of personality.  Oh man.  Does he punch as hard  as everybody says he does?  Yeah, he punches pretty hard  of course.  Yeah, he punches pretty hard.  Let me punch.  I mean I punch people hard too.  I mean I'll punch hard.  Yeah.  Punch Jimmy in the face.  But I mean he has a reputation.  They hit a hard hitter, yes.  Stone hands.  Yeah.  Stone hands for sure.  All right, they're going  to shut us off.  So Tito, thank you.  Tito Ortiz, once again  the book is  This Is Gonna Hurt.  It looks like it's  going to be a great read  and if enough people  buy the book  maybe it's turned  into a movie, right?  Oh, for sure.  There's a signing tonight  at Virgin 
[02:09:30]  and get the book now  because this is actually  going to be  one they're going to  yank off the shelves  and have to redo the cover.  Yeah.  Because Dana White  wants this UFC belt  off the front.  So how annoying.  Yeah.  All right, we're off to XM.  You guys have a great day.  See you tomorrow.  I know what you want.  Boop, boop, boop.  Look at that boom.  My God, they're giant.  That turn you on?  Whip about Wednesday.  XM 202. 
[02:10:00]  It's Whip about Wednesday.  Whip about Wednesday.  Whip about Wednesday.  Whip about Wednesday.  Whip about Wednesday.  Whip about Wednesday.  B-double-O-V.  Boom.  There's a lovely young lady  showing her breasts.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo. 
[02:10:30]  Get naked.  Chuck them.  Girls all over the country  flashing their lovely boobs.  Guess how many boobs  dents are named.  Can?  I don't have those.  You are  Spectacular.  Well, me.  Wednesday. 
[02:11:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  Hi.  We were just spending a few minutes looking at some of the animations for the animation  festival tomorrow at the Roseland Ballroom.  It's a sold-out show.  God, the Wesley Snipes one we just saw.  That was funny.  That could win the whole damn thing.  That one is really funny.  It's not going to be up to us.  It's going to be up to our celebrity judges, but that one's going to be right up there.  I don't know which one to pick at this point. 
[02:11:30]  Well, as a celebrity judge, I'll make a decision.  That's right.  Jimmy's a celebrity judge tomorrow.  Celebrity.  That's right.  It's hard to get me.  That's right.  And then for all the people that aren't going to go to the animation festival, I say  that sucks because I think we've got a really, really good show for everybody tomorrow night.  I think this one's going to be a hit.  The animations are going to be up on a website starting Friday.  Friday, excuse me, Friday.  And you can see them and download them for free for a couple days.  Then they're going to go to iTunes.  Well, you can see them actually now if you go to myspace.com slash Jim Norton. 
[02:12:00]  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  Really?  No, you can't.  Yes.  Yes, you can.  When are you going to switch over to Facebook?  Fuck Facebook.  You're going to have 5,000 friends.  I'm going to do so that I'll blast the 5,000 people and play fucking Scrabulous.  Yeah, but Facebook can eat my bag.  But if you're going to have friends, you should have it with a number you could handle.  No, that's to promote and to let fans know what you're doing.  It's just my website sucks a dick.  It does?  It fucking sucks a dick. 
[02:12:30]  I thought you liked your website.  What happened?  Well, the guy, Chris, did a good update on me.  I was happy with it.  I still don't like the calendar page, but he didn't do that.  But I want to go to another company.  I fucking hate dealing with the company I'm dealing with.  They're very slow.  Everything takes a fucking six months to get fixed.  It's just irritating me.  All right already.  You're right.  No, I was doing Jim Norton.  Oh.  That's my new thing.  No, but I need to get...  You just need to get a new webmaster.  I want fucking web people.  I want a good website. 
[02:13:00]  Do you like AT&T?  Now that we're not over there.  Did you...  I would say it over there.  AT&T...  You kind of said it over there, but you were cursing, so they dumped out.  Fucking sucks a dick.  You're not happy with AT&T and the iPhone.  I like the iPhone.  The iPhone is a brilliant piece of technology.  But the fact that they fucking...  They stuck a big Steve Jobs dick in our ass when it came to the server.  I said, come on, guys.  What are you doing?  That sucks.  And the fact that you can't get a fucking picture texted to you, it makes you go to the 
[02:13:30]  ViewMyPicture...  ViewMyMessage.com.  ViewMyMessage.com.  ViewMyMessage.com, where you got to go there.  And for some reason, you can't go there on the iPhone.  Right.  So you got to go to your computer at home and go there and look at a postage stamp-sized  picture that somebody sent.  Yeah, that sucks dick.  It's the fucking...  It's the fucking worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  Nice to have my contacts fucking wiped out for no reason.  And why do they do it that way?  Because they're cunts. 
[02:14:00]  I don't know why.  Seriously, what's the...  There's got to be a reason, though.  I thought that was it.  Some kind of reasoning.  I don't know why they do it.  They don't have to.  I know they don't have to.  No.  You don't think Apple could sit there and go, well, we can't figure out how to get pictures  on text.  Yeah.  We can't do it.  I love my BlackBerry.  And I do have AT&T.  And I have no problems.  But you can get photos on that, can't you?  Yes.  Of course you can.  Of course.  Why wouldn't you be able to?  Of course you can.  And full screen and everything.  No problem.  But this one, you use your finger to scroll.  Oh, I'm scrolling. 
[02:14:30]  Do the slow one again.  No, the fast one that goes all the way to slow.  Yeah.  Wrong button, start over  Fucking  I really want to firebomb  Fucking AT&T, they're terrible  It's all about the BlackBerry, I mean the Acceleratrain  Everybody had a BlackBerry  Except you guys, there were like three 
[02:15:00]  iPhones and  All the rest in  First class was BlackBerry  In the future, the iPhone  Will blow away anything  How fucking no BlackBerry  You can't search on it, you can't copy and paste  In the future  How about they have the first version  What do you mean you can't copy and paste  There's no copy and pasting  What are you talking about, that's all I do  Well you can't copy and paste here  No, why would you be able to  That would be fun and convenient  Why would you need that  I'm going to wear a black turtleneck like Mummenschance 
[02:15:30]  And give a douchey thing  And everybody will ooh and ah  Finger scroll for numbers  Can't even take a picture of my fucking dick  And send it to a miner  And you mean coal miner, of course  No  I'm kidding, I don't know any miners with cell phones  Florida Steve loves scrolling Jimmy  I can't even keep track of all the characters Jimmy does  There's a million of them  I fucking scroll, I do it all  Wait, you really can't copy and paste?  No  No  That's crazy 
[02:16:00]  Maybe the first, when they first came out with  What was the first options you had?  Four gig and eight gig?  Yeah  Whoever has a four gig iPhone  Put your neck on the train tracks  And make a call  Until your fucking life has ended  Why would you, I'm only going to need four gigs  So it's pretty obvious they weren't ready to put this to market  They didn't give a fuck  Right  They were sticking it up people's asses  They weren't ready  They should have waited  Why do you think they rushed this?  Because they knew everyone  So they can get you to buy a new one  Because they knew everyone else was working on something too, maybe?  Because they wanted you to come out  And they wanted to show people 
[02:16:30]  Is that Ed McMahon?  What the fuck is he doing?  What is  Ed McMahon faces foreclosure  Oh, hilarious  Good  What the  That's great  Star's money search  Star is in discussions with his lender  Trying to work it out  More than 156,000 families have lost their homes  Poor old bastard  Ed McMahon is facing foreclosure  All that Carson money  He just probably fucking lost it all  That young wife of his probably bought like clit hats and all this other shit 
[02:17:00]  Clit hats  Gold clit hats  Well, you gotta buy the clit hat  You do, but not out of solid gold  Sure  Allegedly, she would wear a gold clit hat that weighed like nine pounds  Nine pounds of gold on your clit is just silly  So on the iPhone, you can't blind CC or can you?  No, you can't do anything  I don't know, I don't have the email on this  You can't copy paste, blind CC, blind CC  Blind CC, copy paste, no  You can't be an angry typing guy on the iPhone  Well, you can't do much on the iPhone  Other than look at it  And look at my pictures you take 
[02:17:30]  Because  I don't have the email function  Because I know it just keeps sending  And then AT&T  Because they are rapists  Will fucking  Will fucking  Douche you  For a $1,500 phone bill  Because it keeps getting sent  Even when you can't shut that feature off  Data  Data transfer  Yeah, they're fucking scumbags  No, no slow clap  Slow scroll  By the way  I have a fun announcement to make 
[02:18:00]  What?  I shit like a racehorse today  How does a racehorse shit  While you're walking?  Well, you've seen the horses  Thank you, Danny  And their assholes just open up  That's what pretty much happened  At good old K-Rock  After the show was over  Unless everybody shits  Their asshole just opens up  This was ridiculous  And I went to the acupuncturist yesterday  And she put some needles in  For constipation  And she even said 
[02:18:30]  That I would be shitting  Quite nicely today  And she was correct  She probably put them  Would she put them  Like on the wrinkles  Of the asshole itself?  We did this break  Where the acupuncture needles  Like, you know  To take care of your liver  They gotta poke your little toe  Or some ridiculous thing  So why don't we play  Guess where they put the needles  To take care of my constipation  It can't be your ass  Or anywhere near there  Because that would make  Too much sense  Right  Your cock hole  That's stupid  Ow 
[02:19:00]  Ow  Your eye?  On that ball of your eye?  Yeah, right through  The fucking pupil  Into your retina  I'm gonna guess  On one of the arms  Or in your feet  Um  Okay  Your head  I had needles in my head yesterday  I had one, two, three  All the way to the top of the head  One in the forehead  One around the scalp  And one right dead center  Top of the head  That's for shitting  I didn't say it was  No, that would make him a shithead  They 
[02:19:30]  For constipation  The needles were kind of  In the webbing  Between  My thumb  And index finger  That's where they  So when they pull the needle out  You can reach into your asshole  With those very fingers  And pull the shit out  Oh, actually  You can see the dots  Where they were  So it's closer to the index finger  In the webbing area  Did it hurt?  Yeah, those two  She even said  Are a bit sensitive  But it'll take care of  My shitting problem  And boy, did it  It's funny  I have not been shitting either  Too many egg whites 
[02:20:00]  Egg whites will bind your  Oh my god  I got duty up in my shoulders  Yeah, yeah  And I had a bleeding incident  During acupuncture yesterday  Because I got bored  I was supposed to meditate  And I wanted to see  How the needles looked  In my body  Because you're laying down  And you can't see  Any of the needles  So I decided to  Lift my head up  And look around  And it was pretty disturbing  Because the needles  Are longer than I thought  And then I put my head back down  And I guess  One of the needles  That was in my ear  Pushed it really far  And started bleeding 
[02:20:30]  Why do you go?  I don't know  You're bleeding  See, that's not  That's against everything  I've heard about acupuncture  No matter what  But you're not bleeding  It was my own fault though  No, you don't bleed  Look, you can see  The little  The yellow marks  Almost look like  I got stung by a yellow jacket  Without the swelling  Oh, that's good  Without the swelling  When you push on them  Do they hurt?  No  At all  No  Swear to god, no  Liar, liar  Pants on fire  No, they're fine  They're a little red  Our guest is here 
[02:21:00]  Who's our guest?  Yeah  Who's he?  You know who he is  Now my phone won't turn on  What, Jimmy?  Now my iPhone won't turn on  So let's get  Sean William Scott in here, man  We had a great time with him  Last time he was on the show  Why won't my iPhone turn on?  So anyway, I'm proud to announce  That the acupuncture  Is working for the  Constipation problem  Well, that's good  And she also got to sleep  How's it going?  How you doing, man?  Sean William Scott  What's up, bro?  How you been?  Good  I just heard a story  I can't  I can't repeat it 
[02:21:30]  Why not?  Why?  I think I  I got one of these, by the way  It's a Blackberry  Do you have one of these?  Fuck, it's the only way to roll, bro  The fucking thing is  I don't know  The thing is  It's so hard to fucking focus on anything  It's always buzzing in your  By your dick  Meh  Meh  Yep  I don't know  I think it's actually  I think it's actually been a bad thing  Well, Kenny's a creep  Because if you have a Blackberry  You get probably 800 emails a day  And Kenny decided to put some kind of like  Alert message for every email that comes in  And that's what I had to deal with on the ride back to New York 
[02:22:00]  Every time one of you idiots sent him an email  Bing  Oh, I got an email  Then he reads it  Puts it back in his pocket  Bing  Oh, I got another email  Yes  GH, it's not only emails  It's for text messaging and Blackberry instant messaging  Which Kenny  Fucking retard  What is that?  Kenny turned me on to Blackberry instant messaging  It's like having a little chat  Like you're in a little chat room  Yeah  Now me and GH  I am each other 
[02:22:30]  Oh, that's great  Another way he can keep in touch with you  You can make fun of him  Yeah, feel free  He doesn't even know if you're making fun of him  What are you doing now, GH?  Huh?  Is that what he texts?  Yeah  What are you doing now, GH?  Well, alright, if you need to know  Everything alright, GH?  Alright, hold on  How's it going, GH?  I will go to our last conversation  Something tells me you don't get a lot of LOLs out of Kenny  No  Uh, well, here's our last conversation  Alright  I actually was stupid enough to start it 
[02:23:00]  I write  Did you call me?  Everything okay?  He writes  No, I did not call you  Everything is good  How about you?  This is just useless communication  I wrote good at dinner with Wheeze  He writes  Enjoy and give him my regards  I can't wait to meet the person  Who molded your radio greatness  That's  That's  Why do I have this on?  That never would have been  Like, no one would have taken the time  To call someone  On a regular phone 
[02:23:30]  Years ago  Before any of this shit came out  That conversation  Never would have taken place  Of course not  You'd have had to sit there  With a paper and pen  Right  And write a letter to somebody  And that's the type of stuff  You're like  It's not worth the energy  Oh, God  So, you got the BlackBerry, Sean?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I'm not sure  I'm not sure it's a good idea  Gotta have something  Gotta  This is good  I had like the old phone  The old flip-up phone  And then I tossed my nephew  Into a pool  He's like eight  But he likes the water  But I didn't do it hard enough  He kind of landed awkward  And I thought he broke his leg 
[02:24:00]  Yeah  So I waited a little bit  To see if he was going to  Come out of the water  And he didn't  So then I jumped in after him  And he was  And he had your phone  He was fucking around  He actually was fine  But then I had my old  Shit phone  But I lost all the numbers  Oh, that sucks  Yeah, that does  I know  There's some good ones on there  I'm not a good  I'm not a good backer-upper  I don't back up my phone  Like, I'm supposed to  You know, you're supposed to  Dock it and back it up  All your phone numbers  And I just hear horror stories  Like, yeah, all my numbers  Got wiped out  But yeah, I got it backed up  On my computer 
[02:24:30]  I think the first three numbers  I put in this  Are backed up  So if I link it up  It's just gonna put  Three numbers on this  I have to back it up  Because I know it's gonna fail  Wait, you back it up  You won't put three numbers on there  What do you mean?  I don't know  I'm afraid  What you do is  Are you panicking  That the one that has no numbers  Is gonna wipe it out?  Yes!  I understand  Every queer feels that way  What you have to do  Is you start off  You go to your fucking iTunes  And you set it to sync  Both ways  It will sync with  It'll  That means  That this will go with this 
[02:25:00]  And this will go with that  No, you don't have one be the master  I hate when it says  Do you  If you hit yes  It will wipe out all your tunes  That you have  On iTunes  And replace them with one song  Yeah  I had to get the bill  For the last three months  To get my numbers  But it doesn't have the names  So I'm fucking guessing  I'm like  Is that Alexis' number?  Yo, who are they?  I think it's Alexis  So then I  Like an ass  I got a little drunk  So I'm like  Oh, I'm fucking  I'm just gonna give it a shot  I'm like  Hey Alexis  What's going on?  It's Sean  I'm like  Is Alexis' Amanda?  I'm like  Fuck  Screw it

Was that a clip  The Scientology 
[02:37:00]  Wow we had a lot of fun  With that one man  He looked good  Very emotionally healthy  You're a humble guy  Must be fun to be around  Listen to him pontificate  Who wouldn't love that?  I don't know  There's something to be said though  Like the higher  Upper echelon  Of those guys  Man  They're loaded  And they get these great parts  And they're just  Always working  Look at that  Tom Cruise  On private planes  John Travolta  Did you see the  Jerry O'Connell spoof?  Which actually is pretty funny  Oh my god  And he looks a lot like Tom Cruise 
[02:37:30]  It's really funny  I just actually saw  Is it a spoof  On the Scientology video?  Yeah check it out  It's really really good  He actually does a great job  And then  I saw this thing  On  I think it was YouTube  Did you ever see  This thing  This pastor  Who was  Singing this like  Church song  And it's really cheesy  It looks like it's like  15 years old  And then all of a sudden  He breaks onto this  Weird kind of  Demonic kid's voice  And he doesn't do well  With himself  Yeah it's a little  Marky thing  He is the most  Frightening individual  What is that?  We did a lot of time  On little Marky  Can you break that out? 
[02:38:00]  No we haven't done this  In years  Oh so that's an old video?  Yeah it's an old video  That just made it to YouTube  I guess a while ago  But this guy is so  Fucking creepy  Why does he do that?  I really don't know  But he shouldn't  Can you imagine  That you're gonna have  Your kids go up  And pray with that guy?  No  Never  I actually do know  Why he does it  Oh yes Jimmy  He's an asshole  Classic  Absolutely  Yeah find that one 
[02:38:30]  Because  He did the abortion one  Yeah yeah  He did like this  Little Marky thing  Where he sings  He kind of does  This spoken word thing  As the little Marky voice  And it's about  How he loves his mommy  And everything  And how he's inside  His mommy  And he's so happy  That he's gonna be  Coming out  And then she just  Rips him out  With a hanger  Or some shit  She goes and has an abortion  What the fuck is that?  Oh it's fantastic  It's unbelievable  It makes for great radio  That horrid voice  He puts on 
[02:39:00]  Oh so that's  Little Marky  Yeah  Yeah he puts on  The little Marky voice  I can only imagine  How he got to be proficient  In doing that voice  Heard it enough times  Muffled in a pillow  You little fucker  Horrible human being  Yeah we're trying  To find the desk  Let's find it  I was saying  In the meantime  I just got this receipt  From Master Poe  Who parks my truck  And gets my gas  Right  It's a new record  We have a new record  For the price of gas 
[02:39:30]  For my fucking Escalade  One hundred and five dollars  To fill my tank today  What?  A hundred and five dollars  Are you doing premium still?  I have to  Fuck that  Yeah I go regular  Fuck that  No it's a new  You know it's a new engine  I believed in the premium  When gas was at dollar twenty  But at four fifteen  Or whatever the hell  It's up to  Four sixty  Four sigma  Yeah yeah  It's a ridiculous amount  Of money for gas  Hummers are going away 
[02:40:00]  They're good?  It was reported yesterday  Yeah they're going to  Redesign them  Or they're going to  Sell off the division  I got one of those  They're going to redesign them  And make them look like  Toyotas  Because that's what's  Selling right now  I bought one like  Three or four years ago  I don't know fucking shit  About cars  I'm like this thing  Looks kind of neat  I saw The Rock had one  Yeah  Like the guy's also  Six seven  You know  It doesn't look like  A chump like I did  You know  So I had it for four days  I drove around  People are like  Fuck you  You fucking idiot  I'm like what?

They just hated the cars in LA  They're like  You fucking small dick asshole  Yeah  You're definitely compensating  That you have a small dick  Yeah  You're a pussy  It was actually kind of  A comfortable car  It is a ridiculous car  It was like sitting in a  Lazy Boy chair  Yeah  But it's so stupid  You just look so small in it  Right?  You gotta be a monster  To drive one of those  That's why  That's just why I like mine  I like that it's very  Comfortable to drive it  I can hit fucking bumps 
[02:41:00]  In the road  And not worry  I get pissed off  A little car in front of me  Jams on the brakes  I have to jam on my brakes  Because they chewed up the road  So they could repave it  And he goes  Duk-gunk  Duk-gunk  Off the edge of it  Like it's a fucking canyon  Just move  And that's why I like  The Escalade  And  I can make U-turns anywhere  If there's a median somewhere  I don't care  I'll fucking  Pong-pong  Right over the whole thing  And make a U-turn  I'm not scraping out  My transmission  Right  And that's the only reason  But

[02:42:00]  What do you hate the most about L.A.?  I don't know man  I think after spending time out here  It just doesn't compare  I remember living out there  And all the New Yorkers  Were like  Fuck L.A. doesn't compare  I'm like  Really?  When I actually came out here  I was like  Oh my god  I haven't gone out in L.A.  I have no desire  I mean  There's cute girls out there  But it's just  I don't want to fucking drive an hour  And drink  Yeah to go anywhere  You gotta drive a fucking hour  To get anywhere  The bars close at like 1  They're kicking your ass out the door  Talk about all these  Great L.A. parties  1 o'clock  Get the fuck out  Yeah  Here it's 5 in the morning 
[02:42:30]  And they're just looking out the door  People are smoking  Still in the bars  It's like  Fucking  You want to see real parties  It's  You know  Go to a club in New York  You're absolutely right  Ever since I went out here  I was like  I just can't go out  In L.A.  It's completely different  Yeah  Let me get on the fucking freeway  So the California Highway Patrol  Could see me weaving  Down the road  Because I gotta drive  68 miles  To get home  Really does stink  Hey we found the  Little Marky thing  Oh good  You want to hear the Little Marky 
[02:43:00]  Let's hear the Little Marky  Don't tell them which one this is  Oh no  Oh okay  How many is this  How many is this  Oh boy  There's enough to  Put them away for life  I think  Oh and then we're done  I gotta tell you guys  You guys know Bridget the Midget  Yeah of course  Oh Bridget the Midget  I fucking  I flew her in  You fucked her?  Oh wow  Wow that got me  Your brother did?  We didn't really fuck  We went down on her  I flew her in  For my brother's bachelor party  Wait  Kiss her and then you're like  Move six inches  And you're mouth full of pussy  Mouth full of midget pussy 
[02:43:30]  I figured you guys would appreciate that  That's great  Did she party?  She stayed and partied hard  He flew her in  He flew her in  For the bachelor party  For a bachelor party  Wow  The one that got married  Didn't mess around with her  But my other brother  Who I  My brother  Named Dave Scott  He fucked this girl  Not Bridget the Midget  But when he was in fifth grade  And I was in second grade  He fucked this girl  Every day  For a year  And I would watch  Not really watch  I was just kind of pervert  But I was like  I just kind of wanted to be around it  Because I knew they were doing something  Kind of naughty  And I would have some dirt on them 
[02:44:00]  So I'd play with my G.I. Joes and shit  And I look over there  And he's like switching off with his buddy  In fifth grade  Holy shit  And so he ended up  He's the one who ended up  Hooking up with Bridget  Right  But then they ended up  I mean they were partying  Like Hunter S. Thompson  Like hard  And she stayed and partied  Like at one point  They had  Oh I love this guy  They had like a big long pipe  That they made  And the pipe was actually  Longer than her  Than the Midget girl  So like literally  They had to hold the pipe for her  And she partied so hard  I mean I didn't see 
[02:44:30]  This whole thing  With my brother  And her  But my brother was actually  Just laying on his back  And she just squatted over him  Oh that's hilarious  Well I think that's the only way  You could really  Fuck a midget  It's true  Cause like if you  If your missionary  Is just weird  You feel like you're suffocating  Or I would think  Like her head  Is beat by your belly  My brother's a big boy  She was on the show  A couple times  She's funny  She was alright  Can we tell them  Our favorite midget story  Oh that one  I love that  This is unbelievable  So this girl  She calls us up  I don't remember exactly  How it all went down 
[02:45:00]  But she was a midget  And she wanted to get into  Like stripping  So we invite her  Come in to strip  To audition  To audition  And she literally got up  On the console  And started stripping  And we had the music  Who was here?  There was a big celebrity  Tom Hanks son there  Was it Colin Hanks?  Colin Hanks and Jack Black  Oh and it was Jack Black  Fantastic  It was in Orange County  Yeah  That's when they were  Promoting that  And she starts stripping  And everyone's there  There's a table of guys  Just checking her out  And she starts stripping  And then  She took her top off 
[02:45:30]  Right  And she had like  Kind of weird midget tits  Which was cool anyway  Because like  It's cool to look at  You know  It's like wow  They're midget tits  But they were kind of like  Cross eyed  It was really weird  They kind of went in  And stuff  But it was cool  They were tits  And then it's a midget  And she's dancing  And then she took off  Her pants  She was in her panties  And we wanted her  To lose everything  And she's dancing  And we're like  Come on  Take the panties off  So she kind of started  Getting a thumb  Hooked into the edge  And she's dancing 
[02:46:00]  And she's got those  Midget legs  That are just like  An old  It looks like Tom Mix  You know  He's like  Like you've just been  On a horse too long  It looks like  Bowling pins upside down  A little bow legged  And stuff  But again  It's cool  Because it's a midget  And shit  You know what you're getting  It's not like  A regular chick  Pulled her pants down  And she's got  Fucking midget legs  That'd be horrifying  But it's a midget  So she hooks her thumb  And starts pulling down  The panties  And we're like  Come on  Lose it  Lose it  You're not doing this right  And we started  Maybe critiquing her  A little too much  Saying if you want  To be a stripper 
[02:46:30]  You're going to have  To lose this stuff  She starts crying  There's  Half naked  Crying midget girl  Because the fear  Took over  Yeah  I didn't realize  There's no way  I could do this  It felt so bad  The awkwardest moment  On the planet  Yeah yeah  She's awkwardly  Pretty much naked  In front of us  She's still trying  To dance a little  And she's crying  She's still dancing  While she's crying  Yeah she was doing  This half ass now  It wasn't even  Her heart wasn't  And the music cuts out  And it's like  They have to change tapes  Yeah yeah  And it was just silent  And we're like 
[02:47:00]  Okay  Off the console  Like the end of  It was like the end of  With Coco  Oh yeah  Put your thumb in your mouth  But that'd be great  If she started crying  That's when everyone  Starts jerking off  Stay sad  We like it  Then she had to  Awkwardly put her  Clothes back on  In front of us  Oh yeah  It was really bad  And then she kind of  Ran away  As best as a midget  Could run  And she was crying  Oh they were horrified  That she was crying  They kind of got 
[02:47:30]  Some chuckles out of it  I think they kind of  Liked it  But you know  Oh it's so good  It's not going to  Like that  At least a little bit  Well I remember  When we  I told all the guys  At the brachel party  I'm like I'm bringing  In Howard Stern  I think it's Howard Stern  Or somebody's favorite girl  And so they're all  Like jacked up  And psyched  And they're all  Pretty jacked up  And so I go down  And it was at this  Really nice place  In Santa Barbara  Because I wanted to  Get a vacation out of it  Because I was just  Actually about to  Start shooting  It was two days  Before we started  Shooting the promotion  Is that the movie  You're promoting today?

[02:52:00]  I'm not a celebrity  We're getting tired  You do a movie every six months  You're a celebrity  Doesn't mean they're good movies  How did Mr. Woodcock do for you  Fucking terrible  Have you seen that movie  Oh my god  But you came in  And you were promoting it  And everything  That was the last time  You got it  It's work  Do you remember  It was painful actually  That was one of the old movies  I ever did  Where I walked out  After 15 minutes  And I said  I'm fucked  Oh really  I sound like I've watched  Any of the other movies  I mean I like some of the things  I've done  But that one 
[02:52:30]  I was like  Wow this is so unfunny  It's not even funny  Dude wears my car  It was funny  That was a funny fucking movie  Did you smoke a lot of pop  Before that  No I drank a lot though  I was a little drunk  Well you know what  Actually I did a movie  With the guy that directed  Dude wears my car  And Harold and Kumar  It's called  Balls Out  The Gary Hausman story  And it's  We might be screwed though  Because we  We're gonna make it  With a studio  But then they wanted  To tone it down  And so we just  Wait for independent  And it's  I think we're gonna get  NC-17 rating  But it's so fucking funny 
[02:53:00]  It might be the funniest  Movie I ever do  What's wrong with  Fucking studio executives  And even radio executives  All these people  They don't know  What funny is  Yeah  And they have no clue  What can be put out there  Without the world exploding  Don't worry about it  Just put it the fuck out there  People are gonna enjoy  The shit out of it  We were just talking about that  Just let you guys  Do what you do well man  Yeah  And don't worry about it  Yeah  No it's funny  It's great  We love it  We love it  It's just a couple of things  I want to talk to you about  Oh  You mean all the funny parts  You want all the funny 
[02:53:30]  Yanked out of it  All the funny parts  Tame it down  So when's Ball's Out coming  Well I don't know  I think we'll  I think it might go  Straight to DVD  Because I don't think  I think the theaters  Or the studios  Yeah that NC-17  Is scared  Which you know  If you watch  You're like  This doesn't deserve  An NC-17 rating  But like  The thing that I'm surprised with  Is I think you see  Like Superbad  And all those movies  Doing well  Because they're already comedies  People can't hear  People will swear  People want to see that shit  Again you know  It went for so long  Where it was like  Oh let's get a cutesy  G  Or PG rated movie  Like Mr. Woodcock 
[02:54:00]  Is that PG?  It was PG-13  Yeah  I'll be like  Because there's some  Parental guidance  Fucking asshole studios  What is Ball's Out about?  It's about  I play a guy  Named Gary Hausman  Who  It's so fucked up man  He used to be  A tennis player  And he wasn't good enough  So he ended up  Playing in Mexico  And he got into  This little  He wasn't  He wasn't very good  Down there  And he got wasted  At this strip club  And in Tijuana  And he saw this  Stripper come out 
[02:54:30]  And she was about  To get fucked by a donkey  And I'm like  No  Don't take her  Take me instead  And so we kind of  Insinuate that  I get ass raped  By the donkey  And I get kicked out  Of Mexico  And I go on  This big road trip  And I end up  In Nebraska  As a janitor  At this small  Little high school  And Brady Quaid  Plays the high school coach  Holy shit  And he asks  He  He sees me playing tennis  And I'm kind of  I forget if I'm  Fucking fat  In the movie  I got big gross mustache  Tight shorts  Fucking balls are out  Just gross  And he's like 
[02:55:00]  Hey it would be great  If you could  Play a little tennis  With us  Maybe teach the  Cappy  Cappy thing or two  And I live in Winnebago  Right outside the high school  So literally the next day  Brady Quaid has a heart attack  And I take over the team  And it's just like  It's kind of like  It's kind of like  A live action South Park  Like a Wes Anderson film  On Nasset  Also it's not  The smartest movie either  So I don't know  But it's like  It's like a crazy  R-rated comedy  Right on man  Yeah I don't know  But I don't know  If it'll come out in theaters

[03:09:00]  At this level  You need chicks  Who keep a secret  Yeah  Because they want a brat  They banged him  I'm at any level  But I do  I need hookers now  Hookers  You mean if I give you this  You'll put this in your mouth?  Fair enough  That's great  One time I banged a porn star  That I met on your show  Fellas  Really?  Wow  It's a long time ago  This is back in the day  John Jeremy  Could you give us a name?  Ron Jeremy  Ron Jeremy  No that's Jim's story  While we pull the train together 
[03:09:30]  Yeah  Mark Burnett was here  And I was here  And they didn't have time  To have these strippers  These  These like B-level  Porn stars on  And you had these two girls  Just come in and sit naked  While we  Reviewed Mark Burnett  But Mark Burnett had  Two girls  They had huge tits  These were little  18 year old  Perky ones  And you just  Trying to remember that  No no no  She gave me her number  And then like two weeks later  She called me when she was in LA  And I wrote her  That whole joke about her  That I do  I go  This porn star  Asked me out one time  She told me she was an actress  In porno movies 
[03:10:00]  You know this joke  So I'm like  Alright well when do you want to go out?  She said I'm working  Tuesday and Wednesday  How about Thursday?  I'm like  How about Monday?  But that conversation  Really happened  And it really happened  Wow  Yes  Just hours after  Appearing on  Did she want money to fuck or not?  No  No  She liked me  Wow  Jimmy do you remember  Did she kiss you?  I don't want to bring up a bad idea  Did she kiss me?  Remember the porn star  That was banging the intern? 
[03:10:30]  Yes  She was a chick from Cleveland  She had a fat puss  And there was one of our interns  His name was Noah  Noah  This is an amazing story  Because Jimmy really wanted this Cleveland porn star  Yeah I wanted to pay her  She was definitely really hot  And he wanted to pay her  Yeah she wanted a thousand dollars  That she wasn't going to get  But then she fucked one of our interns for free  For free  And they actually had like a little relationship going on  And then started dating the intern  Oh no  And now I still hope she's making movies  And no one  No one knows your name  No one  Maybe they do 
[03:11:00]  I don't know  Maybe he really did pay her though  Maybe he's just saying he didn't pay her  Nah he's an intern  He couldn't have made enough money to afford that  You know what I mean?  500 bucks a pot  Are you saying that if she did go out with you  That she would have some kind of name now?  For me mentioning it enough  She'd at least have something  A disease  Yeah exactly  So what maybe no name  But at least you'd have a little fucking hep C  To straighten out  Keep it on the straight and narrow  I just got a communique  That Obama is flying to New York  And he wasn't supposed to fly to New York today

Tickets are available  Mostly for the late show  The first one's pretty packed  But this late show's gonna be crazy  And what's this video going on?  This is all for the Comedy Central show  I thought I would start out explaining  You know like what I'm about  Here's the thing fellas  You know me a long time  Yeah  I performed everywhere  I've never headlined in New Jersey  I'm from New Jersey  I never had the balls to go back  Really? 
[03:15:30]  So I invited all my friends  My family  Everyone I went to high school with  Is all coming down for this taping  It's basically  You know  A homecoming thing  Wow  If you tank on this  It's gonna be fucking embarrassing  Hopefully it goes better than  Janis Joplin's fucking high school reunion  You know how bad that was?  They all hated her  She cried  I'm performing at my high school this week  I'm doing all kinds of stuff  Oh that's great  Jeff Ross today  At Jonathan Dayton Regional High School  In Springfield, New Jersey  Wow  That's a big day  Jesus  Then I'm going down to  They line up all the girls he's dating  Good boy 
[03:16:00]  Then I roast New Jersey at the Borgata  Saturday night  That's a great concept  It'll be really fun  Absolutely  They wouldn't give me an honorary diploma  At my high school  Why?  I'm like you know  You probably fucking got kicked out of 7th grade  No I didn't  No I went up a couple more grades than that  You don't get it  I made 12th grade twice  One and a half times  And then they were just like  You know you're really not doing anything  It came down to gym you said  It came down to like my gym class  Like I didn't have enough gym credits  And we called the dopey gym teacher  And he said no sorry 
[03:16:30]  I'm like I just want to come in  I'll do a couple pull ups  Whatever  You give me my honorary diploma  From John H. Glenn High School  In Elwood  And  What did you win?  Most likely to impersonate Jack Nicholson?  I was just never in  I never went to school  And that's why I failed  When did you call your gym teacher?  Well years ago  On the air?  When we first got to New York  On the air yeah  When we first got to New York  And they were like no  Mr. Woodcock  Mr. um  Polini right or something  Polina  Polina  Pete Polina 
[03:17:00]  Pete Polina  They called him Pistol Pete Polina  Yeah  Back in the old days  Did they?  They did  And what happened?  And uh  Apparently he still holds a grudge  That I you know  Never had my gym shorts  And shirt and everything  And I'd come out  In my sneakers and jeans  What an ass  I was a complete ass  No him not you  No I was  I was a horrible student  Oh big deal  I didn't  I should have worn my  My uniform  Fuck that school  Uniform  Well whatever it is  You know my shorts  And you know how they want you to wear shorts 
[03:17:30]  And a t-shirt to gym  Yeah  You can't wear jeans  And your fucking you know  Army jacket  You look silly  Playing ball in that  And that was me  That was you know  I never  I never  Why would I bother?  I'd rather smoke pot with my friends  Instead of do gym  And that's what I did  But you know you think  Alright  I kinda  I kinda did okay  Give me an honorary diploma  Yeah we were gonna do a whole thing with it  You know  Yeah  Play it out on the radio  Run around the track once  Sure  I'll do a pull up 
[03:18:00]  Get my diploma  Be nice  Be a sweet tender moment  It could be kinda weird  To go back to your high school  Now I suddenly  As you talk about it  I get nervous about it  It's probably gonna be really strange  You could be on stage  In the big auditorium and stuff  You used to have to wear the white shirt  It's gonna be surreal  I would get a little crazy about it  I went a few years back  And the teachers are doing the exact same thing  I'm like how bored are they  I've been around the world since I've been here  And they're doing the same fucking thing  You're the most famous person to come out of your high school? 
[03:18:30]  That's what they told me  Yeah  I think I am too  I am too  No you're not  I know  Mariah Carey  Mariah Carey came out of Harbourfield  Is that true?  I got Trump by Mariah Carey  Yeah  Oh man  I don't know  I'm not even a close second  That's  Only the greatest  What the biggest selling music artist ever at this point  When I was at Timber Point  Elementary school  You probably went to a much bigger high school  Sorry Ant  No  No  I had a small high school  I had a good shot 
[03:19:00]  I had a really good shot at this  You did  Mariah's fucked you up  Yeah  Boomer Esiason and me went to the same elementary school  But that was in another town  So he's got East Islip wrapped up  Oh wow  Yeah  But me  I rule Elwood  What about you Jimmy?  Do you know?  Most famous Jimmy?  You?  Ari Spears is from North Brunswick  Alright that pretty much seals it up  But I don't know if he went to the high school  Or if he moved  His mom used to take him to open mics  When he was really young  I remember  When I first started too  So I don't know  You think he graduated? 
[03:19:30]  I don't know if he moved  Because he got  He did career stuff pretty early  So he might have went to LA early  I don't know  I should check North Brunswick Township High School  If somebody could check that  I don't know who  I'm sure someone will know  The answer just by listening to the show  Who's the biggest celebrity from your high school?  I would love to know who else  Who else got famous from Harborfield High School  Because I really don't know  I always  Interesting  I claim the second position  But maybe that's not even  Maybe not  Maybe now that somebody else came  And maybe you're not 
[03:20:00]  Maybe I'm not  Yeah I want to know  John Glenn High School  Who's the most famous  Harborfield High School  Obviously John Glenn  He didn't go there  He never went that bastard  And you know that son of a bitch  Never showed up at that school  Ever  Why would he?  He didn't go there  He had a thousand schools  Named after him  Well show up  At the schools  He had a light to live  Yeah  Show up  It's just an excuse to meet him  I have fucking  One of the rooms in my house  Is the fucking  Neil Armstrong Memorial Dining Room  Let's see if he shows up  Sorry guys  Jimmy you're right  Aries Spears did go 
[03:20:30]  Oh wow  No bad  Did he graduate high school?  Yeah I mean  It says alumni  What are you trying to say?  You're not listed by the way  Should I update you?  Doesn't  Well yeah  I dropped out senior year  Oh  Yeah  Yeah see that's what it is  You always had a sort of  Under the radar existence  No I was class clown  Really?  They didn't give it to me  They gave it to this good dude Joe  Because I was in rehab  When they did the pictures  Oh well that's kind of rough  And maybe the  You're  Shut up  You should have seen  Took you down a few notches  What a fucking  Cunt face  Nothing I was 
[03:21:00]  In my high school year  But picture  I had my hair  Kind of combed back  And I had glasses on  I looked like a  Fucking  I was such a nothing  I don't even have  A high school  Class picture  Never went  Didn't care  Picture day  I'm like fuck you  So then why should you  Get an honorary diploma  If you didn't care  Because now  Why should they care about you  Because I care now  Jeffrey  Good point  I care now  I want to be recognized  You don't care  What did you do  Well then you need to  Bring something back  I need to make a contribution  You need to give back 
[03:21:30]  To that school  How about I give  Some kids  How about I give some money  To their radio program  I know they  I know they have  A radio class  Maybe I could buy  Some equipment for them  In exchange for  The old sheepskin  That's not a bad idea  Yeah  Make a little donation  Why do you want to  Buy a diploma  Fuck them  The beauty is  You don't have one  And you're still  A millionaire  That's the great part  Oh but I think  Karma dictates  That I do it  Karma  Yeah  Why  I don't know  Kind of go back  And give 
[03:22:00]  Give back  When did you start  Thinking about karma  Jill told him  Oh  Of course  And she said  Carmel  In her fucking thing  But he misunderstood her  Are you kidding  At this point in my life  I'm starting to look like  Jesus Christ  What did I do  I really need to  Start giving back  You want to be a philanthropist  How about fucking  Hooking up third mic  With an extra fucking  100 G's  There you go  Exactly  Keep it in house  Yeah exactly  I'm putting in a pool  For fuck's sake  I can't afford you  I want to come to your pool  Middle of July 
[03:22:30]  We're gunning for it  I was telling this girl  That I'm dating  That I wanted to go  To fucking  To see you  In your pool party  But I'm going to slim down  We're supposed to be  Going out to dinner tomorrow  Yes  I want to do that  With Jimmy  Where are you guys going  I don't know  We haven't really  Nailed down the plans yet  Very nice  Is Jimmy bringing a date though  Yeah  You are  Yeah  It's biznitch I know  Ooh  Biznitch  Jimbo's always got  The hot chicks around him  Lately 
[03:23:00]  Something's going on man  Yeah  They're hookers  I have a gun  I'm a rapist  Jim's always got  The hot chick  Tied up with a black eye  Another rape joke  Boy  Way to be unpredictable  Jim  Anyway  Jeffrey  What are you finding  Interesting in the world  These days  You watch the Obama stuff  Where are we at  It's very exciting  Got a big primary coming  Yep  We're going to be  The general election  The primaries are over  I think it's very exciting  John McCain said 
[03:23:30]  We might have to stay  In Iraq for a hundred years  Yeah I know  Which isn't a lot  Considering he just turned  752  Why would we vote for a guy  That won't get out of Iraq ever  Uh  Stay the course  We gotta stay the course  The course stinks  Fuck them  Hand them rocks  Here you go  Eat this  Let's leave  Let's leave now  Give us a shit  This gives us more room  It does have nothing to do  With um  The security of this nation  The soldiers  Anything like that  It's one of these situations 
[03:24:00]  Where  Yeah I could give a shit  About those people over there  I could give a shit  About the Iraqi people  I don't care what happens  To them afterwards  I don't care if there's a bloodbath  I don't believe that  And the bath party  Takes back over  And and  Saddam  Gets brought back from the dead  Like Frankenstein  And runs the place  I could care less  We ought to do is this  I don't believe that  I believe that you care  And you're just saying that  I believe that if you really  Saw that people were dying  Because of it  You would care  I know  You're not that kind of guy  No you know what 
[03:24:30]  I don't  Because because then  Rise the fuck up  And and unite  And have a revolution  And make the country  The way you want it  As as a people  That's right  And if you can't  And you get defeated  So be it  That's fucking life  But no one has any solutions  That's what frustrates me  The most  Is like  Now it'll go into  The general election  You'll have two candidates  Who will debate  No one's going to have  Any solutions  On how to bring  The troops home  They're only going to argue  About the votes  Five years ago  Yeah  So here's the analogy  That I'll make  It's as if me and you  Anthony 
[03:25:00]  I invited you to go  Rhino hunting  That's nice  We shot  A fucking rhino  Nice  The rhino falls  On top of us  And when he's falling  He goes  What did you shoot me for  I'm Bob Kelly  Dan  You shot me  I'm a knee dude  Combined efforts  To push this thing  Off of us  We argued  For five years  About whose idea  This was in the first place  Wow  When we could have  Just pushed it off  Together  I say push the rhino off  It worked on the view 
[03:25:30]  That's good  I like that  But you know what I'm saying  There's no solutions  There's only this  Bickering about the history  Yeah  That's what frustrates me  The most  Yeah  Who was for the war  At the beginning  Who wasn't  Who said this  But if they use  Their combined teams  And strength  And effort  To come up with solutions  They never want  To work together  I've never seen  Such partisan politics  Than I have in the past  I don't know  What  Like eight  Ten years  Years ago  I think they actually  Used to work together 
[03:26:00]  Didn't they  And things like  Got done  Everybody had the same  Common cause  You watch the old days  Before politics  It was awesome  Shit got done  Now  They're afraid to back  The other party's ideas  Because then  In four years  It'll be like  Well they backed that idea  Even they thought  This guy was great  It'll be used against them  And it gets used against you  So all they're thinking of  Is the next election  They're never thinking about  The time that they actually  Have to spend serving  After they're elected  And four years back then  Was a long time  Now it's nothing  They thought they were 
[03:26:30]  All going to live eight years  You know  Let's do this  It's really  It's really incredible  I'm going to miss  Hillary and the race  It's exciting with Hillary  Hey  Speaking of the race  We could get Larry Sinclair  On the phone  Jimmy  Let's get him  Of course  Are you up for a Larry Sinclair interview  I certainly am  You know who Larry Sinclair is  No  He's the one that went on YouTube  And claimed that  He blew Obama  He blew Obama  And Obama bought  Cocaine for him  And crack for himself  Meaning Obama  And 
[03:27:00]  He did it numerous times  Or something  Do we have that clip  We should replay it  Before we get Larry  On the phone  I heard a crazy rumor  That John McCain  Is so old  He once owned  Barack Obama's  Great great grandfather  I don't know how  This shit gets started  But it's just wrong  Alright this is  Larry Sinclair Jeffrey  Listen to this claim  That he  He made  Do we have the  I want the XM version  Okay good  Here it is  Larry Sinclair  We're going to get him  On the phone in a minute here 
[03:27:30]  Hi  My name is Larry Sinclair  I'm making this video  And posting it on YouTube  Because of an incident  Involving myself  And Senator Barack Obama  Between November 3rd  And November 8th  Of 1999  In the Chicago  Illinois area  The mainstream media  And Obama himself  Has done greatly  To prevent this story  From becoming public  During those time periods  In 1999  I met Obama  At an upscale lounge  In Chicago, Illinois 
[03:28:00]  After having a few drinks  Obama and I  Left in my limo  Began to drink  Mr. Obama  Acquired powder cocaine  For my use  Crack cocaine  For his use  I performed oral sex  On Senator Obama  Who at the time  Was a state representative  For the state of Illinois  Mr. Obama  Knows these  Allegations  To be true  I'm challenging  Mr. Obama  To come forth  Be honest  Stop claiming 
[03:28:30]  That his drug use  Is limited  To his teenage years  1999  You weren't a teenager  1999  You were state representative  For the people  Of the state of Illinois  1999  I performed oral sex  On you  In the back of my limo  As well as  In my hotel room  In Gurney  Illinois  Two days later  In Gurney  If you challenge  The authenticity  Of this allegation  I challenge you  To take a polygraph test  As I will submit  To as well  These allegations 
[03:29:00]  Are true  And need to be  Told to the public  That the public  Decide  Whether Mr. Obama  Is being forthright  And honest  Thank you  There he is  Larry Sinclair  How great is that  Larry Sinclair  He believes what he's saying  It's a douche  Which I think  Could be his own  Mental issues  Like that  1999  Yeah  Oh here's Larry  Where's Jimmy  It sounds like  He thinks it happened  In his head  I mean  He sounds wrong  Oh yeah  That sounds authentic  Maybe it really happened  Yeah  Mr. Sinclair 
[03:29:30]  Yes  It's a pleasure  To have you  On the Opie and Anthony  Radio show  How are you sir  I'm going crazy  In Washington D.C.  But other than that  I'm fine  Why are you going crazy  In Washington D.C.  Well I'm just  Trying to get some things done  And get some things addressed  And what would that be sir  I'm basically trying to get someone  To ask the questions  To Barack Obama  And stop tiptoeing around  This self-proclaimed  Democratic nominee  Why do you think  He's  I mean the answer 
[03:30:00]  Seems obvious  But why do you think  He's denying this  And nobody is  Approaching you  For more information  Perhaps the Republican Party  Would  Boy they would revel in this  Well actually  It's not that he's denying it  Because he hasn't denied it  Not unless you call  What his  San Juan Puerto Rican  Attorney  Andres W. Lopez  Went on  Puerto Rican television  Claiming as a denial  But the campaign  Has not denied anything  In fact 
[03:30:30]  They have  Made very  Specific  Intent  Not to deny  Anything  Wow  And as far as  Asking me  Why other people  Are not approaching me  Actually  I spent the last week  Interviewing  And documenting  Things with quite a few people  So let me ask  I don't mean  I missed the beginning  So you  They talked about  The oral sex already  No  Not yet  We didn't dip right into that  He's in Washington  Trying to get things done  Right now  Okay so  Now you had a limo  And Obama went to 
[03:31:00]  Cop drugs  Now you  You say you performed  Oral sex on him  In the back  That's correct  How many times  Did you give him a head  Gave him a head twice  Once in the limo  Once in the hotel room  But this isn't about the sex  This is more about the fact  That he did the drugs  He bought the drugs  And he's been lying  About it every time  Well it's also about the sex  Well yeah  To be a presidential candidate  Who's a homosexual  That is something  To be spoken about  How big's his cock  No comment  Why would you say that  You admit blowing him  How big's his cock  Yeah  No comment 
[03:31:30]  Is it big  Is it fat  Most black guys  Have fat  Big dicks  I got notes for you  But this is a wannabe  Black man  With a white boy's dick  Oh  Damn  No you didn't  Oh yes I did  You say he's basically  A small thin cock  That you sucked  In the back of a limo  I'm not giving any details  On that one right now  Because I'm actually  Meeting with some attorneys  And with some journalists  Here to get this out  Oh you want to go to the times  With the fact that  He has a small dick  Did he come in your mouth 
[03:32:00]  Yes  He did  What did you do with it  Are you a come eater  Never mind  Well do you swallow it  Or spit it out  Come on guys  Are we going to be serious  About this  No we are  This is satellite radio  Yeah this is an in-depth interview  We wanted to get a little more information  Than the normal outlets are getting  Oh no sorry  I had to tell  No  That's fine  We can get as in-depth  But I want to try to keep it  As clean at the same time  Okay  When the man put the rice pudding  In your mouth  Did you eat it  Or spit it out the limo window 
[03:32:30]  I'm not a spitter  That's good  That's a good boy  Alright  Next question  For the senator from Alabama  Yeah  Do you have  Did Obama have like  A freckle or anything  On his penis  I cannot comment on those things  Right now guys  Why  I really can't  Wait hold on  If you tell him the truth  And you gave this presidential candidate  A blowjob in the back of a limo  Why is it out of line to ask  If there was any  Definable features  I did not say  It was out of line  To ask me  You're screaming 
[03:33:00]  No I'm not screaming  Sorry  I did not say  It was out of line  To ask me that question  I said  I cannot answer that question  For you right now  Because of what I am involved in  Here in DC  At the moment  Alright  You know Fez  You've been on our show  For ten minutes  And you haven't said  Ron and Fez  New to three  What?  No this isn't  What?  No this is Larry Sinclair  Oh I'm sorry  Larry Sinclair  I got a little confused there  Here's a question  Is he  Is he cut or uncut?  I will not answer that question 
[03:33:30]  At this time either  Why not?  Why?  What are you doing?  Does he have like  A soft mushroom head?  Pending litigation?  Pending litigation  There is some litigation  But right now  I truly am meeting  With some journalists  And some attorneys here  Larry!  Larry!  We are definitely  Trying to get this addressed  Today or tomorrow  To where it is  Get up  So you went on YouTube  Hold on  Hold on  How much coke  Did he do?  Can you say that  Or did you decide  Actually he smoked  Exactly two rocks 
[03:34:00]  In the limo  And I believe  Another two  In the hotel room  So you can give out  The exact amount  Of cocaine he did  But not help  Whether his cock  Had skin on the tip of it  That's not what I said  I didn't say  I could not give you that  I said I could not  Answer that at this time  Why?  Well that's the  That's the difference  I can't give you that  I can't  You're playing semantics  No sir  I'm not playing semantics  What I'm doing  Is I am actually  Following advice  Because I have spent  The last seven days  In D.C.  Trying to get people  To understand 
[03:34:30]  That all of these  Radio shows  And all of these  Internet attacks  And people calling me  An idiot  Or a mental case  Are not true  I'm not saying they are  I'm asking you  Whether he had foreskin  That doesn't reflect  That your mental health  And I am telling you  That I am following  The advice  And not to comment  On that at this time  Now if you ask me  That question again  Tomorrow  When you can pick up  The phone and call me  I may very well  Be able to give you that  Or it may be  That you're lying  And you don't want  People to have  Something that's provable 
[03:35:00]  Like that  Oh Jimmy  It could be that  You're lying  And you don't want  Something that's  A provable fact  Like if you give  The wrong answer  Hold on  You give the wrong answer  It's provable  Whereas how much  Crack did he smoke  Is not provable  Well actually  It's not so much  That I'm worrying  About lying  Because I'm not  And second of all  I've actually  Answered that question  At one time  And I've been told  Not to respond  To it at this time  Who told you  Because of what  Is going on  Today in D.C.  Okay who told you  Now like I said  If you want to  Ask me that question  So why would he 
[03:35:30]  Even take this phone call  Well the thing is  Okay what answer  Did you get back then  We won't ask you  I'm not even  Going to tell you that  Did you sit on his dick  Did you try to  At least get it in  A little bit  No I did not  Just the tip  Did you lick his bag  What did I say  About oral sex  And yes I did  Alright alright  Let me say  Now you said  You had oral sex  With him in  The limo  And the hotel  In Gurney  In Gurney  How far  What's the time  Difference between  The two times  You gave him  Oral sex  The time difference 
[03:36:00]  Is like I said  All along  I can't tell you  It was the next day  The day after  We were partying  Hold on  Do not  Let me answer  The question  Before you go there  Please Anthony  Sorry  Yes sir  Let me talk  I am just getting  Tired of being  Misquoted  Misquoted  I know  We don't want to  Misquote you  Because you won't  Give a straight answer  Excuse me  Exactly  Sir I said  The time  The dates that were  Involved  Are November 6th  And November 7th  Exactly  More specific than that 
[03:36:30]  You tell me  That's the thing  Were you a limo driver  Why were you in the limo  I was not a limo driver  I rented five star limo service  Oh that's a good question  Why were you in the limo  With Obama  How did you actually  Hook up with him  What was the hook up  The limo driver  Was a friend of Barack Obama's  And introduced us to each other  On the night of the 6th  November of 1999  Who were you  That he would do that  Because I asked the driver  To introduce me  To someone who wanted  To drink and be social  I was in town  For the graduation  Of my godson 
[03:37:00]  From the Great Lakes  Training  Navy Training  Center  So you said  Introduce me to someone  Who wants to drink  And be social  And take it to a  U.S. representative  I had scheduled  To go out Saturday  As well  With my godson  Wait  You're leaving something out  You wanted to find  Someone that would drink  And what did you say  Be social  And be social  And maybe take it  In the shitter  No  No  I did not  In fact  I was not asking  To meet anyone  On a sexual basis  I was asking  To meet someone  Who knew Chicago 
[03:37:30]  Who would be fun  To spend the evening with  And socialize  How did you know  The limo driver  I'm sorry  How did you know  The limo driver  To ask him  I had the limo driver  For two nights already  And you said  Can you introduce me  To someone  Some guy who will be  Fun to hang out with  And why does  Exactly  And why does that  Strike you as being  Somewhat odd  I'll tell you  It happens every day  But why did he choose  Barack Obama  To introduce you to  When Barack was  What was he  He was a state representative  At that point  From my understanding  He was an Illinois senator 
[03:38:00]  And your point being  Illinois senator  So all of a sudden  He says I'll introduce you  To a senator  You're just some shlup  He did not say  He would introduce me  To a senator  He said he would  Introduce me  To a personal friend  Okay let me  Now let me explain this  Do you honestly think  That a senator  Would then  Get in the back  Of a limo  With a perfect stranger  And do coke  And get his dick  Sucked by this guy  You  And not worry  That maybe this  Might fuck up 
[03:38:30]  His career  Let me ask you  Do you want me  To answer the question  Yes  Hell yes  I've seen it done  Plenty of times  Did you eat his ass  Wow  Apparently  You know what  Go to Texas  Go to Laredo  Alright  Go to South Carolina  I'll be right back  Why  I'm going to Nashville  You're talking  You know  You're talking about  This is something  Foreign for politicians  Excuse me  I didn't go out  And seek Barack Obama out  Sure you did  You were looking  I think you're lying  Larry  I believe you at first  But I think you're lying  Because of your lack 
[03:39:00]  Of details  You know  Sir  Why do you think  I have spent  The last week  Here in D.C.  With details  With documentation  What documentation  Sitting down  Answering every question  Being asked of me  Face to face  When is documentation  Yeah when is that  Info coming out  I'm hoping by  In the morning  Have you banged  Anybody in D.C.  While you were there  No I have not  Yeah your name  Wanted to be  Larry the Tattletale  What made you decide  To come out  And admit that  You blew him  In the back of the limo  In his small white dick  First of all sir  I never even wanted  To have to mention 
[03:39:30]  Anything about the sex  I gave this campaign  And Senator Obama  The utmost respect  And opportunity  For six and a half months  To just correct  His admission  About his drug use  Right  Did he sit back  In the chair  Or basically  Did you sit in the chair  And he straddled  Your face  And fucked it  Nothing personal  But you know what  That question  I'm not going to  Digify with an answer  I wouldn't either sir  You're absolutely right  Larry the table layer  Alright hold on  Maybe Larry's  Telling the truth  I don't know  I don't want to  Paint you as a liar  What's a misquote  That you think 
[03:40:00]  Has been attributed  To you that bothers you  Yes  What's the what  What's something  That you've been  Misquoted on  We'd like to know  Because you're saying  That you keep  Getting misquoted  Well people say  Turner  Well I mean  Daily Kos is saying  Oh well he was  A mental patient  Or oh it wasn't  His limo  He said  Senator Obama's limo  And Senator Obama  Was a struggling  Senator  Struggling to pay  His student loans  Couldn't afford a limo  People are just  Misquoting everything  I never said  It was Barack Obama's  From day one  I've always said  I rented the limo  From five star  Limousine service  Okay 
[03:40:30]  And where'd you  Pick him up  Down outside of a bar  Off of Rush Street  And I'm still waiting  That's another reason  I'm here in D.C.  Is I'm fighting  With Citigroup right now  Because they've been  Slow at getting  The credit card receipts  Back to us  But everything  Is documented  I you know  You can say  You think I'm lying  And that's fine  I know you are  I'm sorry  Here's the thing  Because you're saying  Do you doubt him  So much Jimmy  I'll tell you  Only because  He said I talked  To a limo driver  I wanted to meet  Somebody to hang out with 
[03:41:00]  And all of a sudden  The limo driver  Brings him to his friend  Who's a U.S. senator  Who cops drugs for him  Excuse me  Excuse me  That's another misquote  Correct yourself  He was a freshman  Illinois senator  I said that  I said  Oh okay  Whatever he was  Well freshman in Chicago  So he was  First year of high school  That's a little young  Isn't it  Then let me  What  The man is the same age  As I am  Yeah  Yeah but  How old are you  We were both  We were both  38 in 1989  That's exactly  Alright you go ahead

[03:55:00]  That's what I'm getting at  Exactly  Who are you voting for Larry  Hold on Larry  We got an expert  In the field  In studio  We got Uncle Paul  Yeah  Who's who  Uncle Paul  I got a kid's show  Out here  I wanted to know  Did you take the semen  That Barack gave you  In the mouth  And make a cumsicle  From it  Oh my god  You guys  Please do not  Go here with this  I have spent too much time  Being serious  And honest about this 
[03:55:30]  And we're going to  Turn this into  A morning radio joke  At this point  Well no  We're not trying to  No  I just wanted to know  That sometimes  If you make  Don't worry  I don't make things  I just swallow  And go  Jeffrey asked a good question  Who are you voting for  Yeah  Or is that private too Larry  Neither  In fact  Neither  I'm starting to think  I need to go to  One of the foreign embassies  Here on embassy row  And seek political asylum  Oh why is that  That sounds emotionally healthy 
[03:56:00]  How about insane asylum  Why political asylum  Where are you going to go  To Iran  It was a joke  Oh okay  Sorry we didn't recognize  You had none of the makings  Of a joke  Oh  Oh no  I can't tell a joke  But you guys can  Come on  No  Of course you can Larry  And I believe you  For the record here  You know  I believe you  Well I will tell you what  Those who say  They do believe me  That's fine  Those who say  They don't believe me  That's fine  But  Where do you take a stand  I'm going to get  I'm going to get to the bottom 
[03:56:30]  Look  I'm going to get to the bottom of it  To where it's either  They're going to come out  And they're going to ask the questions  And they're going to show what we have  And either he's going to respond  I asked you the questions  You won't answer certain ones  You're being wishy-washy  You're being evasive  Well first of all  I don't know who you are  I've never heard your voice before  In my life  Well we've heard yours Fez  Well I'm sure you have  Yes  But who sounds more high-pitched  And feminish  Mine  Or Jimmy's  Feminish  Feminish 
[03:57:00]  Feminish is not a word  Okay well I just made it up  I would say the voice  Exactly I just made it up  The whole story  The voice that's coming out of a mouth  With a dick in it  Sounds more feminish  Mr. Sinclair  Yes  Tell him about the discounts  Larry  The what?  Nothing  I just decided to go real inside  So I don't think you ever  I don't think you ever  Really answered the question  As to why you're doing this  Right  The only purpose for me doing this  Is he needs to be honest  About the extent of his drug use 
[03:57:30]  Who cares?  The sex is not an issue  You know what?  Everybody in D.C.  Everybody in  You know  Just about  I would be willing to say  About 50%  Of every politician  In every state  Larry  Has engaged in some sort of  Extramarital sexual relations  Whether it be  Gay, straight, bi, tri  Larry that's all  That's all good  Listen to me  Listen to me  You're giving us nothing  That's why the frustration  Exactly  You told us  That what?  Some guy called your mother a cunt  And he attacked you 
[03:58:00]  And who cares?  No sir  I did not say  You know what?  First of all  Jimmy  Now I've been respectful to you  And I understand  It's morning radio  You're right  I understand it's morning radio  But let's not get into the names  No  Because I didn't say the name cunt  No  And you did turn around  And say  Well I haven't attacked the cunt  And the one thing I won't do  Is I won't engage in this with you  Exactly  Larry  Larry I want to apologize  On behalf of Jimmy Norton  Because he is a little wild  At times like that  And yeah  Well no I mean  He can call me anything he wants to 
[03:58:30]  You're the son of a cunt  That's fine  That's fine  He can call me anything he wants to  But when you start calling my mother  Who has been put through hell over this  That's a whole different subject  Okay  Larry you gave us nothing  And we're frustrated  Give us a little something  About Barack Obama  Let me put  It's never heard by a lot of people  And a lot of this shit  Is picked up by the mainstream media  So screw the fucking magazines in Washington  And give us a little something  Exactly  And we'll blog 
[03:59:00]  And we'll call  Breepard to get this going for you  Listen to me  We know Ted Drudge  That's right  You are not listening to me  I just told you  There is a private investigator  Meeting with the driver today  Who is it  Detective Lark  Who?  He's retired  I'm the one tired  Who do you have  Anthony Palatino  Is that the guy?  Yeah  Yeah  Who's your lawyer?  No I'm not going with the judge  From Fox News  Who's your private  Who's your private dick? 
[03:59:30]  You could be  Who's your private dick Larry  Jokes aside  Go  Exactly  Cunt hugger  Did you and Barack's  Hang out  After and cuddle  Or was he romantic  Or was it all like  Tough  It was not all that romantic  There was  A few smooches on the neck  And this and that  Afterwards  It was  Smooches  We met  We sat in the bar  For about an hour  An hour and a half  Talking  What did he drink? 
[04:00:00]  Okay  He was drinking  Chivas and Crown  That would have called 45  I would have believed  Yeah  Excuse me?  Who made the first move?  On the sex act  Or the drugs?  Either one Larry  I had mentioned  I had made the statement  In the bar  That I could use  A couple of lines  To wake up  And he thought  I could use a blowjob  And it hit a crack  No Jimmy  Actually he asked me  If I was talking  About coke  And I said I was  And he said  He could help me out  So he copped the drugs  Where did he cop  The drugs from Larry? 
[04:00:30]  We left the bar  Drove about 30  35 minutes  I gave him $250  He gets out of the limo  Five minutes later  He's back  Right  Anything else?  Yes  Who smoked the crack?  You both did right?  No  Exactly  I didn't even know  That he had bought crack  Or had crack  Until I had already done  Two lines  Was going down on him  And he pulls a glass cylinder  And a baggie  Out of his pocket  While he's in my throat  I'd love it if that was true  Where he's getting his fucking  Ditch sucked  Smoking crack  Wow  He really knows  How to get the endorphins going  You know 
[04:01:00]  It's amazing  I've actually met people  Who actually get more  Aroused on crack  Than they do on anything else  Who are these people Larry?  We want names  Excuse me?  Who are these people?  Give us a name Larry  We think you're lying again  They're private citizens  It doesn't matter  Well we want their names  Who are they?  Who are these drug smoking fruits?  Well first of all  I'm not a drug smoking fruit  Exactly  Of course you are  I'm a marlboro smoking fruit  Oh good  Is that where the tumor came from? 
[04:01:30]  Or did I call it your brain hat?  No Jimmy  I think it's hereditary  Because it tends to run in my family  Brain tumors?  That's good karma  Who else has the brain tumor?  No cancer tends to run in my family  Who else has the cancer?  One's in every family Larry  Huh?  Not many people escape the cancer  No  My father didn't escape it either  My mother didn't  And I haven't yet  Alright good  But I mean that's not a sympathy thing  And I really  You know when you start  Mentioning that you have doctors  Making statements 
[04:02:00]  Dr. Eric Nagel made a statement  No no no  Let me finish Jimmy  Sorry  The next time you want to say  That you have information  About me from doctors  Why don't you ask me  To give you the name of my doctor  What's the name of your doctor?  I'll ask you right now  What's the name of your doctor?  Dr. Vinnie Boombox  Judson Somerville  What is it?  Judson Somerville  How'd your parents die?  Now what else did you know?  Justin Somerville  Oh god  Do you have something in your ears?  No no no no no no  Yes  It wouldn't be the tip of a dick  I'm sorry  What's that? 
[04:02:30]  Oh  Oh  I didn't think he's implying that  I didn't hear what he said  He said you might have a dick in your ear  I think you have a dick in your ear  But I do  But I won't tell you  Whether it's uncircumcised or not  Because I'm talking to reporters  Hey hey hey  And magazines  Instead of talking to  One of the biggest radio shows in America  No I  Listen guys  I understand that  When you  When he called  When the radio guy called just now  He asked  I thought you guys wanted me to go on in the morning  Other shows are going to hear this  And say we're not having this guy on  Because he doesn't reveal anything new  He lies through his fucking teeth 
[04:03:00]  Or he's holding back  First of all you caught me on the way out the door  You can say what you want to  But I assure you  Jimmy  I have listened to you  Now you're going to give me a chance to respond  Okay but your doctor's name please  I just told you  I couldn't hear  Because you were too busy making snide remarks  Justin Somerville  Justin Somerville  And where does this quack reside  Excuse me  Exactly  It's a proctologist there Larry  Oh god  Never mind  Colon and rectal surgery  Yeah  Dr. Justin Somerville 
[04:03:30]  Justin Somerville is a proctologist  First of all  My doctor is not a proctologist  You got an asshole doctor  Feeding you Ambien  I bet you he goes in with a miter  So  Oh christ  Oh god  You claw right in there  You got an ass cave Larry  Listen  I am sorry  I like to explain mine  Hey  What  Are you talking about  I am very sorry  But I do have to go  I have an appointment  What's your appointment Larry  Another lie  No sir  My appointment's to meet with someone  Who you meet with Larry 
[04:04:00]  Would you like to know where and when  Yes I would  I think if I went to the APEC conference  Over at the Washington Convention  No that was cancelled  Everybody knows that  Yeah Larry  They cancelled that  Larry  You gonna talk about the time  You fucked Joe Lieberman in the ass  What  Remember  You remember  Excuse me sir  I have never done  What you just referred to  No  To anyone  Neither male  Female  Nor animal  You've never fucked a guy in the ass  I  You're a bottom  You're a sloppy party bottom  Yeah  Right

[04:05:00]  Before they took him  For the Saturday night  How many times  Do you even listen to anything  Really Jimmy  I listen to a lot of lies  Because the hotel  Had no record of you being there  Excuse me  I talked to the guy  Fucking Ted  The night guy over there  Who said that there's no record  Of you ever being in that fucking hotel  There you go  I just turned over the record  Straight from Choice Hotels  Outside of D.C.
