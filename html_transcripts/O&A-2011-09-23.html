<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Larry King's comedic intro, setting the tone for the irreverent and often offensive content to follow. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton recounted their Small Claims Court experience against Sandy Cain, who was subsequently declared "dead to us."  They humorously described the other court attendees and their lawyer, Kenny's, eccentric behavior.  The segment ended with the satisfying non-appearance of Cain, likened to winning a blackjack hand.

The conversation then shifted to an upcoming fishing trip with Bob, newly quit from smoking and therefore reportedly more irritable.  The hosts jokingly discussed "The Morning Jam with Jim and Sam," a competing morning show, playing a sound clip to highlight its perceived inferiority.  A significant portion focused on a female guest from the previous day, referred to with highly offensive language, detailing her appearance and behavior, repeatedly using her self-proclaimed nickname "Twat√©."  Audio clips from the previous show featuring her were played. The segment concluded with a discussion of the news about neutrinos potentially exceeding the speed of light, leading to speculation about time travel and the future of humanity.  This transitioned into a discussion about human longevity and the regret of missing out on future technological advancements. The segment ended with clips from a Chilean television show, "Mi Nombre Es," featuring Eddie Vedder and Brian Johnson impersonators, prompting discussion about a similar US show. Patrice O'Neal was a guest in studio during this portion.

Patrice O'Neal, still in studio, then detailed his experience at the Charlie Sheen roast, highlighting the extensive editing that removed jokes about diseases (including his diabetes) and Down syndrome. He discussed interactions with various celebrities, including Charlie Sheen, Mike Tyson, and William Shatner, expressing frustration with the Hollywood system and the perceived unfairness of the industry, citing Whitney Cummings as an example of undeserved fame. He criticized the Workaholics cast's perceived lack of sincerity during an interview.  The discussion included humorous readings from the "Book of Ted," concerns about OnStar privacy, and anecdotes from O'Neal's career.

The show continued with a discussion about police using technology to track cell phones, even when off, raising privacy concerns. This transitioned into a broader discussion about the erosion of privacy in a technologically advanced world, speculating about a future of constant monitoring.  Highly offensive racial slurs ("Crackers," "Hills," "nigger") were used during a discussion about perceived government targeting of those viewed as "freedom fighters."  The hosts discussed property taxes and government overreach, with one host describing interactions with neighbors and the police. A caller, Eric from Jersey, explained how to set up catch-all email accounts to identify spam.  The conversation returned to societal issues, including the Occupy Wall Street movement (referred to disparagingly as "pussies" and "faggots"), government overreach, and the possibility of a homogenized global consciousness.  The hosts debated the positive (medical advances, communication) and negative (privacy concerns, social control) impacts of technology, speculating on time travel, interstellar colonization, and replicating human consciousness.  This led to philosophical discussions on consciousness, human emotions, and the limitations of technological advancement. Kevin Smith was interviewed, discussing his film "Red State," its sound design, and the show's themes, and his upcoming Q&A event.  The segment concluded with a mention that Dr. Michio Kaku was on the line.

Dr. Michio Kaku was interviewed, discussing a falling satellite, the faster-than-light neutrino experiment, human cloning, teleportation, the Big Bang, the multiverse theory, and 3D printing technology.  Patrice O'Neal was still in studio, promoting his shows, and Chris Cornell was a guest, discussing his solo career, the song "The Keeper," and his experiences with Soundgarden.  The segment included a humorous interaction with Sway Calloway.

The interview with Chris Cornell focused on his vocal range, his solo career versus Soundgarden, songwriting, collaborations (including a story about exchanging files with Slash), balancing solo and band work, and anecdotes such as a Black Sabbath concert where the drummer had a person counting off beats. The hosts also discussed the evolution of Cornell's and his bandmates' personalities. The interview concluded with promotion of Cornell's new song and tour. The show then transitioned to the "After O&A Live" segment, featuring Sam Roberts and interns Matt and Sal, focusing on their awkward interactions with the veteran staff, including anecdotes about Matt's encounter with Anthony Cumia.  The segment included calls, notably from Sam Roberts' father, reacting to comments about Sam wanting Opie to be his father.  Discussions revolved around the interns' experiences, the dynamic between the interns and long-term intern Paul, and the differences in their personalities.  The segment concluded with plugs for upcoming events, including a cancer benefit and "Secret Show to the Future 2," with mentions of staff members like Roland and his nervous behavior and flatulence.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute.  You want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You got it, guys.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  This place is insane.  You guys like to cuss on that.  Yeah, yeah, a lot.  It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews, and of course, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:04:00]  This show is so disorganized.  This show is so disorganized.  This show is so disorganized.  This show is so disorganized.  This show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying it.  Well, then turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career, the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Ah, good morning.  Yep.  Hi, everybody. 
[00:04:30]  How is everyone?  Oh, what a new perspective I have on things.  Yeah, right.  Having been run through the judicial system, spit out the other end.  Where justice has prevailed.  Just feel better waking up today, and you're free.  You're a free man.  They have a pretty good system down there, though.  Yeah, they do.  I'm kind of...  They're pretty efficient.  They were pretty efficient. 
[00:05:00]  Get him in, get him the fuck out.  Because it's obvious they don't want to be there either.  No.  Not like the old days where they just make you sit all day.  That is an assembly line of court.  Yes.  They just bring in people...  A congo line.  Yeah, a congo line.  You're right.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  Anyone, anyone that doesn't know.  My God.  We had to miss yesterday's show.  That alone was enough to really shake me up. 
[00:05:30]  The thought that I was able to probably sleep another two hours, and then get up and not  drag my ass into this godforsaken shithole.  Anthony, we got...  Let me tell you.  Shook me up.  We got problems, though.  What?  What happened?  We missed one day.  One lousy day for a frivolous lawsuit.  Yes.  Let me play something for you.  That came to my attention.  Oh, boy. 
[00:06:00]  Get up, folks.  It's Jim and Sam on The Morning Jam.  No.  They changed the production and everything.  Oh, that's horrible.  I love it.  This is exactly what's going to happen when we leave.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You'll get it.  Within a day, this is what you'll hear.  Some kind of slappy and wappy stuff.  The Morning Jam with Jim and Sam. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I like that.  Da, da, da, da.  Da, da, da.  That does wake you up, though.  Makes you face your day.  Yeah.  Do you guys know what it is?  It's friends.  You're hanging with friends on your drive to work.  That a boy.  Did you guys even think of us?  No.  They're too busy working.  They're working.  Twa-tay.  Twa-tay.  I'll tell you one thing about Small Claims Court, though.  I guess people know that Sandy Cain, who's now dead to us and will never be on the show 
[00:07:00]  ever again.  Nice move by her.  Unfortunately, just to us.  That was really smart on her part.  Really smart.  To get a few bucks in her pocket, she chose to piss off the entire audience.  Well, not the entire.  I'm sure there's a few people out there that really, really like that Sandy Cain suit.  But in general, the numbers speak for itself.  She's dead to a lot of people now.  You've got to say, to attempt to get a couple of bucks from us.  Yeah.  Oh, correct.  Because she didn't get anything.  Correct.  But yeah, so we were over at the big courthouse down there in lower Manhattan. 
[00:07:30]  And they do got some system in there, though.  They drag everyone in.  And then you take your little seat.  You look around the room.  And me and Opie were just looking at everybody, trying to figure out what they were in there for.  Oh, we were cracking each other up.  They were bad landlords, bad...  A lot of bad landlords.  And then the Asian guy.  There was an old fucking...  This guy had to be like fucking... 
[00:08:00]  He was like, I'm going to sell you a mogwai old.  Yeah, like he came off the boat and he's just been making Chinese food for the last 50 years.  And all we're picturing, like we're trying to picture what their testimony is going to be like.  And him going, I'm not in charge of food shipment.  Did not know it was cat.  Did not know it was cat.  And then there was a shim in there.  There was some shim.  And the ugliest, it was a guy with a blonde hair and a ponytail, just like a chick. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, the hair was pulled back into a ponytail.  I guess that's what shims look like when they're not all dollied up.  All gussied up.  What was the case of that?  There was something about...  It was a jewelry store.  Right.  That guy was...  Oh, really?  Yeah, I heard the whole thing.  He had something to do with a jewelry store.  And I guess there was some kind of rip-off that went on.  But I was praying to God, and I haven't prayed in a while, that you were going to walk in.  Yeah, sit down and be like, oh, shoot, same room. 
[00:09:00]  Well...  Hi, guys.  This woman took some money from me.  This lady took my Zeppelin wallet.  We were hoping you were part of the shims case.  It's been very embarrassing for all concerned.  One way or another.  I was sat next to you in my mouth, and I'd be getting pasty.  Like, hey, guys, you guys getting called yet?  So, what are you guys up to?  What are you guys doing?  Leaving soon?  And then there was a lady that was sitting right in front of us that had no nose.  Had no nose.  And I think it was because...  What did you say at breakfast?  It was because she might have done the Michael Jackson thing. 
[00:09:30]  Too many nose jobs.  Too many nose jobs.  I was thinking she was in there to sue a doctor or something.  I think she was the lawyer.  But she was the lawyer for a black chick that was in there.  Right.  And then a lot of, like you said, like landlord company names would come up.  Yeah.  Because when they're doing the roll call, they, you know, it's like state of New York, and  they're like here, you know, and then they're representing, and then it's like, uh, Muhammad  Abu Das, Abel.  And, uh, he goes, and it's like, uh, he's the guy that runs the building, and obviously 
[00:10:00]  there's just rats and fucking cockroaches running around in there, and he's not doing  anything, so.  Just a horrible landlord.  Yeah.  And then, and then the lawyers that are just used to this shit.  Oh, the fucking...  Filing in.  The, the, the sharp dressed, actually not even sharp dressed, they have these suits on  that they've just been wearing for years, so they're a bit ill-fitting.  Right.  And, uh, they all have horrid hair.  Yeah.  And, and they come in...  With their newspaper.  With their newspaper, and they know it's going to be a while. 
[00:10:30]  And then they, they just very loudly call out the name of their client, because they  just want to get right to it, and that's what they do.  Right.  So, you know, this guy comes in, and he's like, you know, Bob Johnson!  Right.  And looks around, and fucking Kenny goes, he puts his head down a little, goes, here!  And the guy, like, quickly turns to go look.  Turns, looking for Bob Johnson.  And then I had to do the, I'm looking for him also, because, because I, I couldn't look  at anyone. 
[00:11:00]  I was ready to laugh so fucking hard.  And then when the guy realized he was being fuck with, he was so pissed.  He was so mad.  And just kept looking over at us, because he knew the sound came from, he didn't know  which one said it.  But he couldn't figure it out.  And then later on, let me, and then later on they do roll call, and they say Sirius XM,  Anthony, and then Opie, so then the guy turns all the way around and just stares at us,  because then at that point he knew we were the fucking pranksters.  But when Kenny went, here! 
[00:11:30]  And then in a quiet, you know what it's like in a quiet courtroom when you just hear papers  shuffling, and then someone's big folder hits the ground inadvertently, and then you  hear, you dropped something!  Oh, of course he did!  Yeah, Kenny kept us entertained.  He was the worst person to have in court.  He dropped something.  After he gives us a speech how...  Ah, you dropped something!  But that's after he gave us a speech how we have to behave and take this very seriously, 
[00:12:00]  and he's got all these documents and bullet points and all sorts of shit.  The burden of proof is on her.  She goes first.  Right.  Don't react to anything until you actually are questioned about it.  And then he gets in the courtroom, and then he can't help himself.  He has to be the idiot.  You dropped something!  Yeah.  And then how long were we in there?  I don't know.  We were in there for a little while.  About an hour, maybe.  Yeah.  The whole thing was about three hours at the courthouse. 
[00:12:30]  It was that.  Yeah.  9.58.  9.58.  You dropped something!  And then she doesn't even show up after all that.  And then after all that, we were sitting there, and I guess we have a window of opportunity  there, where she can come in at any minute, and it starts.  But if it passes that window of opportunity, I think it was something like 9.45 to 10.15.  That was it.  They called us at like 9.45, and they give her another chance on the second roll call, 
[00:13:00]  which is at like 10.15.  If she shows up any time in between that, of course she's there, and we proceed.  So I was sitting there, and I was telling the guys, I'm like, I feel like I'm at a blackjack  table.  I'm sitting on a fucking 20.  Sitting on a 20.  The dealer is showing a 4, and flips that fucking 7 over.  And now I'm just waiting for the picture card.  Because, you know, if she doesn't show up, I got the winning hand. 
[00:13:30]  If she shows up, that's like the dealer throwing the picture on top of it.  21, you lose.  Because I just didn't want to deal with it at all.  And every time the door opened and closed, our heads are turning.  Like, is it her?  And then these ghoulish women would walk in, and we had to do a double take.  Like, is that her without a wig?  An old man walked in at one point.  I thought it was her.  It was Lassie without her fucking makeup.  Yeah.  Was it Lassie?  Sassy.  Sassy.  God damn it. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, you're right.  Sassy.  I mean, fuck, from the old Flintstones cartoon.  Yes, Kenny.  You forgot this.  When they were calling roll call.  The court officer asked me if the shim was her.  He wasn't sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Is that her?  We might have had a few fans in the courthouse.  Yes, they could have showed up.  We may have had a few people working out for us.  What pissed me off, though, is they start calling the cases, and I'm like, all right, we're going  to at least see some cool shit.  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  And now, I guess nowadays, they go right up to the bench and just talk to the judge there.  Well, they talk to the judge.  You don't get to hear anything.  No one sits at the table or anything.  I thought it was like night court.  No, you kind of walk right up to the bench and talk to the judge.  Well, what good is that?  But sometimes if they talk a little loud, you could hear what they're saying.  Well, what good is that if you've got to sit there all day, at least get to hear some  cool shit?  I know.  I guess they don't want, because there's other business going on at the same time.  Right.  Like, there's still the clerk, and the guy's still calling some kind of roll call during  the time where they've got the little cases going on. 
[00:15:00]  I thought it was like People's Court and all these other court shows, but they just don't  televise it.  I'm like, all right.  It's an assembly line.  Yeah, I know.  It's an assembly line.  That sucks.  But justice prevailed.  She did not show.  And then I took a little stroll.  I got off the subway at about 42nd Street.  I took a little stroll down Times Square to see if she was out there with a dumb guitar playing,  because I would like to have snapped a picture and said, here's what she's doing when she's  inconveniencing us with our time. 
[00:15:30]  She's out there with her droopy-ass tits fucking in Times Square being pointed and laughed at,  you freaky monster.  Yeah, I don't know why she chose to do that, because the Opie and Anthony show was good  for her business.  Well, it was good for her business.  And now, you know, we don't want anything to do with her.  You think that's why she didn't show up?  Because she didn't want to go through with it?  She's not that smart.  She's a dummy.  She's a dummy.  She's a monster.  I parted my hair for nothing.  I had a part in my hair and a dumb dress shirt on. 
[00:16:00]  I haven't worn a dress shirt in years.  I swear, I assumed she might, if she showed up.  Yeah.  And again, she would have to go up first and present her entire case.  You know, here's what I said in the complaint, and here's what I have to prove it.  Wait, can we back up before that?  Because as soon as the judge came out and we found that she was like a middle-aged woman,  Kenny Lee Dover dramatically is like, we've got to settle. 
[00:16:30]  He goes, we'll go with arbitration.  We'll go with an arbitrator instead of the judge.  Like, Kenny became this, like, top lawyer all of a sudden.  We've got to settle.  There's something about testifying about someone shitting in her hat.  Right.  That maybe another female's not going to see it our way.  Yeah.  Sorry, but with that, she's got to prove her case.  Yeah, she has to prove her shit.  So I was just certain that even if she did show up, she wouldn't have anything with her 
[00:17:00]  that would have proved her case.  So odds are we wouldn't have had to do anything or say a word to say, hey, dismiss this.  She got nothing.  And, but, you know, the slob didn't show up so good.  Good riddance to you.  Now we're back on the radio.  And then I just pictured, like, one of our fans having her in a trunk the whole time  so she couldn't show up.  That was just one of our overzealous fans.  She's uptown playing Cods.  You don't have to worry about it. 
[00:17:30]  Bring her fucking, bring her brother in from Israel.  Sit down.  He could have had a family of his own.  It was between the monsters, Kay.  He is here to support his beastly sister in her time of need.  He has missed the jam show.  The jam show, I know.  What a jam.  What a jam.  Was it good?  Perfect thing to go with your toast.  Yeah.  Was it good? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, perfect thing to go with your toast.  Oh, I like that.  Kenny wouldn't let us call in as our lawyer.  He also wouldn't let me.  Kenny would not let us call in as our lawyer.  He interrupted me while I was talking about what was going on that day.  The whole reason that you weren't.  Like, he wanted me to just talk about things that had nothing to do with the case.  To plug his Facebook also?  He wanted Facebook blogs.  But he wanted me to just bring up topics.  Yeah.  And I was like, well, me being here, especially before Jim even got there, he was like, no, 
[00:18:30]  talk about something else.  On the air he was saying this.  And I said, no, I'm not.  I'm talking about stuff that we've discussed.  That's why we're here.  We have to let the listeners know that the reason I'm here and Opie and Anthony aren't  is because of the Sandy Cain case.  Litigation.  We would so could have talked about it.  But as our high-priced lawyer yesterday, we chose to follow his advice.  Well, thank God he's off the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case.  And he can now come to work some of the smaller issues.  I show up at Starbucks for a briefing.  He starts yelling at me. 
[00:19:00]  I'm like, whoa, settle down.  This is a stupid, frivolous lawsuit.  You're out of order.  That's small claims, Gord.  He's giving me all the we should have done this type shit.  I'm like, well, that's too late.  What do we got today?  And then he pulls out a file.  Oh, he had a file with pictures.  Did you have a briefcase yesterday, Kenny?  Everything.  Just a vanilla folder.  Yes, he had a briefing.  But he had pictures.  He had video.  He had audio clips.  Everything.  He had bullet points.  What we should say.  What we shouldn't say. 
[00:19:30]  We should avoid this.  If they say this, you say that.  Don't worry.  I got you covered.  He told me not to talk about it on the air because he didn't want to tip off the other  side.  No one was listening and hearing that Kenny was collecting evidence.  So now we really have to work.  The sad part is yesterday cost us a fortune.  Kenny's going to charge us a lot for what he did.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yes.  I need a retainer.  We should have just paid Sandy Kane.  We would have made off, I think. 
[00:20:00]  Working both sides.  Yeah.  Conflict of interest.  But he starts yelling at me.  I'm like, Kenny, we're at a Starbucks.  Yeah.  Going to dumb small claims court.  Let's calm down a little bit.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  But Kenny is the man.  He takes care of us.  Yeah.  Everything was nice.  It's just the way he does it, which is kind of entertaining for everybody.  I just love how security's gotten, too, where you walk into that place.  And I swear, I was waiting to go to the fucking American Airlines terminal. 
[00:20:30]  No, no shit.  It's just the security, the sensors, the fucking x-rays, everything else.  And then you get through and you're like, so?  What was that all about?  I remember the old days.  You'd walk in there, smoke in a cigarette, run right past everyone to the elevator.  There's just nothing going on.  Didn't matter what you had on you.  Get upstairs to your courtroom.  Ah, that's right.  We got a question coming in from Steve in Boston. 
[00:21:00]  Steve.  Yeah, I was just wondering, are you guys showing in all day for Jim and Sam?  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Jam, perfect.  What is it?  Jam, the perfect.  The morning jam is just where you need to go with your toast.  Yeah, I like that.  That's good.  The morning jam is just where you need to go with your toast.  I saw that Howard's studio is almost finished.  Not to lie to you or anything.  Punch it out, guys.  That's good.  Why would you do that to me?  What do you mean the studio is almost finished?  Oh, what?  It's being. 
[00:21:30]  It's just being remodeled.  Renovated in a major way.  Really?  Yeah, and we can't even get lights.  Maybe we'll get some hand-me-downs.  I'm not going there today.  Thank God.  I'm happy because this weekend has matched the Hatch, too.  Yeah, that's something to be excited about.  Nothing's going to ruin my day.  Oh, boy, is Bob in rare form, too, because he quits smoking?  I know.  So he's doing good.  He's actually off.  Oh, boy, have fun.  But he's a little short-tempered.  And he's bringing his own meals, he told me.  I'm like, can we at least go out to dinner?  What?  He goes, yeah, I'm allowed to have one real meal a day. 
[00:22:00]  So, yeah, we'll go out to dinner.  He's eating MetaFest.  It's just me and him.  Last time, he brought his wife, dogs.  Should eat a hollow point.  We looked at a bed and breakfast just for the goof in the video.  Oh, that sounds romantic.  But it looked creepy as all hell.  And even I said, all right, no, we can't do that.  So how long are you guys going for?  Just a night, night and a half.  Oh, just one, okay.  Yeah, leave him tomorrow, come back Sunday type of shit.  Do you know how much Bob must like you for? 
[00:22:30]  He's missing a fucking UFC championship fight.  That is crazy.  And there's nowhere to watch it up there.  No, not at all.  He'll try to hook something up.  You know what, dude?  I got this app.  Oh, dude, I'm going to set it up.  We could watch something on a little fucking phone.  Well, he only shows you his calorie app.  Oh, God.  I was at the cell last night and I'm at the table with Keith and Bob is just talking to  Noam and he's like, nah, dude, I got this new app.  And we're both just like, all right, already.  What, you fucking stop it? 
[00:23:00]  It's his app-a-tizer.  How do you think of that?  Is this a good one?  He says he's fat.  He says something nice, though.  We're going to be on a boat in a river.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  No more standing in the muck?  No, we stand in the muck on Sunday.  Oh, okay.  We're doing two days this year.  Yeah.  Wait, you're fishing Sunday morning after you're coming home Sunday?  When are you coming home Sunday?  In the afternoon, I guess.  But you're going to fish in the morning first?  Yeah.  Fucking fishing stinks because you've got to get up early.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Fuck fish.  What's with their fish and their dumb schedules?  Exactly.  Fuck them.  What are they, mailmen?  No, what?  They only eat an early breakfast and that's it?  No lunch or dinner?  You know what it is?  They probably want to get that continental breakfast at the hotel.  They like to be up nice and early.  You put a tiny little bagel and cream cheese on your hook, try to trick them with some cheap  fucking coffee.  I chum the water.  Even before I didn't have money, I hated the continental breakfast.  Oh, that's horrible.  I never liked that shit.  Fucking horrendous.  Don't try to label it a breakfast. 
[00:24:00]  It's horrible.  Carbs.  It should be called the here scum.  Yeah.  Cheap room, asshole.  Yeah, we're going fishing.  A little fly fishing and some fishing off the boat.  Yeah, what are you going for?  I don't know.  All the bass, I guess.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Going for some big, large-mouth bass?  Supposedly some five-pounders.  You're going with a large-mouth ass.  Yeah.  Ah, whatever.  Yeah.  We should have some stories on Monday.  It should be fun.  A couple of men fishing. 
[00:24:30]  Get up, folks.  It's Jim and Sam on the Morning Jam.  I like the music.  That's a pick-me-up, man.  Yeah, but you got to move a little when it comes on.  Oh, yeah.  I was.  When you move, I move.  That's right.  Just like that.  Just like that.  Act like your audience.  Right.  And that way you can, you know...  It puts you in the right frame of mind.  Yeah.  You can relate to them a little better.  Goes good with your morning muffins.  Oh.  Post. 
[00:25:00]  You know what the best part of yesterday was?  Was...  Not being here.  More old-school cop stories.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  From, you know, people.  I don't know.  Old-school cop stories.  You can say that from Kenny.  Oh, well.  Yeah, okay.  Every industry or business was different.  Yeah.  We talk about our old-school radio stories.  That is true.  Although, you know, nothing quite really, you know, that could get us in trouble still.  Oh, no.  I'm not going to mention it. 
[00:25:30]  I know.  It's just really a pleasure to hear some of these stories.  I love the tear in Kenny's eye as we walk past the original police station with the lions  out in front.  It's his fucking police station up downtown.  It's like the original fucking NYPD police fucking station.  This building's been in movies, man.  He was waxing fantastic about how many people fell up those stairs and fucking the hijinks.  He goes, if those walls could talk, they can't. 
[00:26:00]  They're covered in blood.  The one next to you was, though.  Okay.  How many old-school mob guys were dragged into that place?  Let in there and out.  That building is impressive, isn't it?  That's a good...  That looks old-school fucking police.  There's trees on the roof.  The lions by the stairs when you walk in.  Oh, yeah.  That's some official-looking old-school shit.  You know, some shit went down.  Hells, yeah.  Um, so that's it, I guess.  Yeah, that was our fun little day. 
[00:26:30]  The Morning Jam with Jim and Sam.  Yeah!  We gotta tag that with something, though.  That Brady Bunch-sounding music.  Yeah, The Morning Jam with Jim and Sam.  What?  Oh, I have an eye.  Can we hear that again?  I have a way to tag it.  Yeah, cool.  All right, yeah.  The Morning Jam with Jim and Sam. 
[00:27:00]  Perfect for your toast!  I'm nervous.  You guys may have things going on, but you can't make it.  I would think that...  The Morning Jam.  Yeah, Jim and I are forward-thinking people.  I think that recording...  Yeah.  That thing got pulled immediately.  Put in the catalog for these two.  Resume stuffer. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  We're working on something together.  When's the first best of?  I mean, next show, probably.  Once one thing of quality is said on that program.  Twat√©.  I heard you guys did great yesterday.  We had a decent show.  The girl was really...  I liked her.  She wasn't cunty enough, but I wish I'd give her...  It was my fault.  Less time to the...  What was she calling her pussy?  Twat√©.  The Twatou.  Which I don't think people cared for.  I know I didn't. 
[00:28:00]  But I liked her.  She wasn't a bitch.  She was just a motor mouth.  Ugh.  Yeah, I know.  And she said it a lot.  A lot.  She kept saying, my Twat√©.  Did she show her Twat√©?  No.  She might have been doing this.  Don't fucking talk about it.  She put a strap-on on over her pants.  A pink one.  Oh, that's sexy.  Yeah, great.  I know.  Over her pants.  But she could be real...  I could sense that she's a fucking true dirtbag.  And she could be probably really sexy if she wasn't just being goofy in that moment.  She could probably really...  She put her fucking hand in my mouth. 
[00:28:30]  Which, that's only somebody who's a real fucking pervert understands that that's dirty.  Right.  To shove their fucking hand down your throat.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something filthy about it.  That's her right there.  Is she good looking?  Yeah.  She's a little...  I guess she's older than I thought she was.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, yeah.  She's older.  She's a bit older.  Yeah.  She was calling herself a cougar.  I didn't think she was.  She's got them separating tits.  Yeah.  Her boobs are a little rough.  That's, I guess, a boob job that's getting a little old.  Yeah.  Is that what happens?  That's why the sternum turns into a landing strip.  Just a lot of... 
[00:29:00]  Ooh, sternum.  Name that after me.  It's, yeah, like the tits get too far apart.  Oh, my God, yeah, man.  What's going on there?  Ah, she's a hag.  She sucks.  Fuck that cunt.  No, she's not.  She's horrible.  No, I hate her.  I love her twatay.  She put her fucking hand in my mouth.  Ooh.  Fucking beat it, sister.  Kept trying to get her to turn Jim on with what she would say in a cuckolding situation.  Really?  She wouldn't say.  She just kept being goofy and chatting.  Oh, no.  About what, though?  I don't know.  I want to hear her say twatay. 
[00:29:30]  Oof.  Do we have that, Iraq?  I'm sure we do.  Why would we if she said it a hundred times yesterday?  Oh, Iraq's got it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Fucking stogie boy has it.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, stogie boy you missed, too.  Stogie boy.  Something called stogie boy?  Yeah.  What's stogie boy?  What was it, Eric?  I don't know.  You came up with it.  It was on your t-shirt.  You came up with it.  He was wearing a t-shirt yesterday that was giant and yellow.  Well, it fit him.  And it was yellow.  Oh, oh, oh.  And it said stogie boy on the front.  It was terrible.  What does that mean? 
[00:30:00]  What does that mean?  Cold stogie boy.  What does the shirt mean, Iraq?  He said he didn't know what it meant.  He just wore it because it was yellow.  Oh, that's good.  What does that mean?  Didn't convince anyone because how...  But who wears shirts because they're yellow?  Who has ever said, I need a yellow shirt today?  I hate yellow shirts in my world.  I wouldn't wear a shirt because it was yellow.  Stogie boy.  Especially if it said stogie boy on it.  Sounds a little...  Do you got it, Iraq?  Yeah, I have it.  Let me hear this, Brooke.  Taking it out and then moving the penis over and having him lick the twat√©. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, that would have drove me nuts.  It did drive me nuts.  I would have said, shut up.  I should have.  Stop with a twat√©.  I should have requested that that not happen at all.  She's probably trying to get some kind of thing going.  Yeah, catchphrase.  A little catchphrase.  Yeah.  She just kept saying it, too.  Like, brother man.  She's probably done a lot and can probably say that on certain radio shows. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  On regular radio.  On regular radio.  She can probably say that on regular radio.  You can't say twat.  So she goes twat√©.  Yeah, she can probably say that on regular radio.  When we were walking the other day, did you hear when we split off or whatever, there  was a guy trying to get money, and I said, not today, because they're all over Times Square.  And the guy actually said to me, all right, brother man.  Hey.  You should have turned around and said, hey.  You were just out of.  It's one of mine, brother man.  No.  I was like, fuck.  I wish I hadn't heard that. 
[00:31:30]  It's taken off.  Brother man.  In the homeless community.  Can we hear more twat√©?  That's all I want to hear today now.  You got another one?  I don't have another one.  All right.  Get a whole disc of twat√©s.  Get a bunch of twat√©s.  And I guess everybody knows it's a big day today.  Why?  A big day.  Big day.  That fucking dummy Einstein.  I told you he was stupid.  Well, you know, we were just talking about that.  He was stupid, and I told you he was stupid all these years. 
[00:32:00]  I'm like the fucking neutrino.  No, I want to read.  Should we get me to you on?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Ah!  Yeah.  I was walking, and I was tapped on the shoulder, and I said, is that a neutrinos?  What are they saying?  We could go faster than light now?  Well, it was a 60-something.  It was a very 60 billionths of a second faster a neutrino arrives somewhere.  They shot it off, and it arrived 60 billionths of a second faster than the speed of light would. 
[00:32:30]  Maybe someone's math was wrong.  They've checked it.  I thought that, too.  Just unplug the goddamn thing.  They didn't even subtract, right?  That might just be a math fucking mistake.  But they've had it checked, I guess, a lot, and they feel very confident.  Yes, I've ran the figures.  Oh, boy.  But is it really that much faster?  Not a lot.  Because you would never even tell that that was faster.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  If it's faster, then it breaks apart everything.  Well, let's get Michu Kaku on to talk about it.  And I bet you he says something like, 
[00:33:00]  Now the neutrino may go faster than the speed of light,  but that doesn't mean your Chinese food will get there any quicker.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah!  Yeah, and then he just, yeah, say to Michu that we're having a lovely day,  and then he falls apart.  Hey, Dr. Kaku, I saw you through.  Ah!  Oh, a neutrino's tapping me.  Well, we should have him on to talk about it.  I think that's huge fucking news if it's true.  But what does it mean?  That time travel will be possible.  It shows you how little we know about physics. 
[00:33:30]  But they've always said if you can go faster than the speed of light,  time travel may be possible.  And if we found this a couple hundred years into technology,  imagine being a thousand years into technology,  what you can do.  We just don't know what we're talking about.  And that's all we could do, because we'll be dead.  No, not really.  With the fucking printers now?  Fart! Fart!  Give me a new hat!  I mean, a heart.  Ha, ha, ha.  Hat, heart, whatever.  Might need a new hat.  I'm telling you.  Shouldn't we be printing our shit now, though?  We're not getting any younger. 
[00:34:00]  Fart!  Are they going to be printing fucking stuff?  And Ray Kurzweil said we're going to be on computers.  I'm telling you, we're just missing the age where we're fucking going to be alive for a long time.  Shit's going to be happening.  Yeah, but we're all going to know each of the things at every moment.  So you're going to lose a lot of individuality.  How much does that suck that we're going to just miss out?  Is it like my son's generation, you think?  No, think about the people that...  His generation will be a big part of it.  Think about the people that just missed out on all this shit, you know?  Yeah.  You've got fucking...  You've got handheld communication devices.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Information at your fingertips. 
[00:34:30]  I would trade in my smartphone to live to 200.  Yeah, I'm sure a lot of people would.  Who gives a fuck about Twitter?  I don't need Twitter that badly.  I need years.  But you wouldn't be able to talk to anybody.  I need years.  You'd be 200 years old going,  Ah, I still got to fucking dial a phone.  Right.  This sucks.  Yeah.  This was like something I used to dream about in elementary school and stuff.  He's pointing at a photo of a black dick.  Yeah.  People that don't know.  Gotta keep it visual, Ann.  Sorry about that. 
[00:35:00]  It really is fun how you hear someone saying something,  and you don't know what the ass end of what he says is going to be.  He goes, yeah, he's looking at a picture of...  And I knew he could have gone a few places with that.  Black dick, definitely the right choice.  That's hilarious.  It's so degrading.  Well, it's only because you were dreaming about them in grammar school,  which is the funny part.  Yes, of course.  It doesn't even have to be sexual.  It could have been they were on surfboards chasing you. 
[00:35:30]  No, just the idea of having something like that portable  that does so much, like a smartphone and stuff.  It's a fucking guy.  It's a goddamn miracle.  But it just happened over a progression where we don't look at it as a miracle.  You look at it like, oh, that's the progression of technology.  But if this was just popped out when, you know, they were still going,  the following program is presented to you in living color on NBC,  you'd be like freaking out.  Go, look, I'm watching on fucking my iPhone. 
[00:36:00]  Watch a Rona Martin's laughing.  Do you remember my iPhone?  Even the iPad is amazing because I remember literally three years ago  or whatever, Bob Kelly was telling me they're going to have these computers  you just swipe to front.  Like Bob's always as much of an idiot.  He's always right about that stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And fucking he was, I was like, it just didn't sound right.  But it was right.  Wendy's is going to have a burger.  It's got mayo, three patties.  All right.  Because he's fat.  Jesus.  But he was right.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  Fucking right, man.  Bobby is like one of the kings of fucking technology.  He's busy right now.  I think he's doing other outlets.  That's good.  Big fucking news.  The Haldoran Collider.  Yes.  Is he going to fit us in?  He's going to try to.  All right, guard.  Can we do the Eddie Vedder thing before we go to break?  Oh, man.  Get Patrice in here.  This is just amazing.  What is it?  Mi nombre es.  Mi nombre es.  Mi nombre es.  This is from Chile.  Yeah.  Someone tweeted this last night.  I want to thank them.  It's so damn good.  I'm suspicious.  But now that we've looked at this show, 
[00:37:00]  I guess it's definitely something that happened.  Yeah.  This show sounds like something that I would watch if it was here in the States.  It's sort of an American Idol type vibe to it.  People come out on stage in front of judges and perform.  And I guess the better you are, the better you do in front of the judges.  That's pretty much it.  But the whole gist is, they come out, and they don't speak English.  They're from Chile.  So they have their exchange in Espanol, as I call it.  Espanol. 
[00:37:30]  And then the name of the show is My Name Is.  And this guy is My Name Is Eddie Vedder.  Right.  And they're all a bunch of different celebrities and singers.  But then this guy breaks into, what song did he do?  Yellow Lead Better.  Yellow Lead Better.  And it's so fucking accurate on the money that we were very suspect that it was fake.  Where is this from?  Chile.  Chile.  They're probably all wearing jackets or something.  Ah, Chip. 
[00:38:00]  And the weird part is, his name is Eddie Vedder, and he sounds like Eddie Vedder.  I don't understand how that happens.  No, he says, Mi Nombre Es, Eddie Vedder.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  That's the name of the show.  No, but his name.  The name of the show is Mi Nombre Es.  But his name happens to be Eddie Vedder, and he sounds exactly like Eddie Vedder.  No, he's Javier.  He's Javier Diaz.  What?  I'm not sure that's accurate.  No, it says it right there.  Mi Nombre Es, Eddie Vedder.  Eddie Vedder.  So that's his name is Eddie Vedder.  And parenthesis.  How come he's cold?  I got it.  It's Chile.  Got it, Chip.  It's Chile.  And it's not spelt like that, like Chile with a L-L-Y. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, it's spelt C-H-I-L-E.  Chile.  You want to hear this guy?  Definitely.  You got to get him speaking Espanol.  Yeah, this shit is going around the internet today.  And believe me, from what we see, and there's a couple of imperfections, very slight, where  you can tell it's not the original song or an overdub, but this guy fucking does an amazing  job at sounding exactly like Eddie Vedder.  He nailed it.  It doesn't look like him.  It looks like Freddy Fender. 
[00:39:00]  And then after this, can we play the Brian Johnson before we go to break?  Yeah.  That was good, too.  First, this guy.  Mi nombre es Eddie Vedder.  Per jam.  Gran grupo.  Queremos ver a Eddie Vedder en este escenario.  Vamos.  Mucha suerte.  But we don't hear him talking.  You're fucked up.  Sam, boo.  Sam.  Mi nombre es Eddie Vedder.  Okay.  Eddie Vedder.  See, he just said what his name was.  Eddie Vedder.  Gran grupo.  Queremos ver a Eddie Vedder en este escenario.  Vamos.  He's going to put this on his hot dogs.  On the ceiling, on a person that I said, let me say, I want to leave it again. 
[00:39:30]  Crazy.  Once I saw her on a piece of rhythm, I said, I'm going to say, I want to leave it again.  He's actually easier to understand than the real Eddie Vedder. 
[00:40:00]  And the rest of it, on a leave it again.  I said, I want to leave it again.  I said, I know how to well at a box, on the back.  Oh, yeah.  Can you sit down? 
[00:40:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Tell my date on where.  That sounds exactly like fucking Eddie Vedder.  Give me chill.  I'm back to the coca fields.  Exactly.  So the voice is impactfully similar. 
[00:41:00]  I'm translating.  But it closed my eyes.  It truly was listening like Eddie Vedder.  Imitating Eddie Vedder is complicated.  And truth be told, you surprised me.  You surprised me.  You did it very well, and I congratulate you.  My vote is yes, yes, yes.  Unanimous.  Welcome to Mi Nombre S.  My name is.  I'm very good.  I worked out at the UN after the show.  I drive down there, and I'm a translator for the Chilean contingency. 
[00:41:30]  That was really good.  I'll bet you that at a Pearl Jam show now or whatever,  or a solo show, Eddie Vedder will bring him out.  He should.  Oh, he should.  That's fucked up how good that was.  I couldn't believe this guy sang just like me.  He's from Chile.  We're harnessing my story.  There's a bunch of these online if you want to check them out yourself.  Some of them are really bad.  Yeah, but this Brian Johnson guy made us laugh really hard.  It's more of a visual. 
[00:42:00]  He looks like Brian Johnson.  He looks exactly like a really thin Brian Johnson.  He looks like Brian Johnson.  But it made us laugh, so let's see if it translates to radio.  From Mi Nombre Es Brian Johnson.  Mi Nombre Es Brian Johnson.  Oh, my name is, don't you?  We're almost all in English.  How are you, Brian?  Good to see you.  Welcome, Brian.  What is your real name?  Ivan Gak.  Well, dear, let's listen to you.  Mucha luck.  He's doing the hand motion. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's got it down.  He's got that constipated shit face.  Wasn't that shit?  No, shit.  But if you want to.  Yeah, he's doing the head thing.  He puts his head down.  He's doing all the moves. 
[00:43:00]  That guy's rocking out.  The old guy.  You know what my favorite part of these shows are?  From, like, Chile and some parts of Europe and South America and whatnot.  The hosts, they really don't care that they're attractive or not.  Like, in America, you need attractive hosts.  Yeah.  With these shows in, like, Chile, they're just, like, throw some guy up there that absolutely 
[00:43:30]  looks like a truck driver.  The one guy that looks like a fat Gary Valentine.  He's Kevin James' brother.  Anybody know that?  He looks like Gary, but a lot heavier.  Yes.  He's not as good, but he just cracks us up, because he looks just like a thin bird.  Yeah, yeah, thin bird.  Old school.  Ah, me nombre es.  Me nombre es.  That should be brought to the States.  I want to see the Eddie Vedder guy. 
[00:44:00]  Any other videos of him yet?  Maybe the show's just starting out.  Yeah, it's Chippy Vedder.  Probably he'll sing another one and just blow the whole thing, not sound like Eddie Vedder.  Ah, that would suck.  That's probably the only song he knows how to do.  Yeah, the Eddie Vedder guy, great.  How would it work in the States, do you think?  My name is.  No, but I mean...  Call it My name is, yeah, and then...  But then they would speak English.  Right.  Yeah, so...  Yeah, that part doesn't matter.  It's just...  It's just impressions.  You've got to sound and look like the guy.  Yeah, that's all.  That's karaoke on ABC. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, but that's not like...  That's karaoke.  A lot of people do their own interpretation.  I don't want that.  No, you want...  I want it to sound just like that Eddie Vedder motherfucker.  You want people that can sound like the artist.  Yeah, and kind of look like him.  Right, without that karaoke shit.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  That was good.  I think this show comes to America.  Yeah, someone brings that.  Why not?  Chile.  Why not?  Chile.  All right, we'll break.  We've got a busy show.  Oh, Patrice is here?  Yes.  Patrice. 
[00:45:00]  Is J.B. Smoove here or not?  I saw an email last night that said he was sick.  Roland says he'll see how he feels when he wakes up.  Oh, no.  Well, no one we know.  All right.  And Chris Cornell at 915.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Yes.  What is he doing?  Solo stuff?  Yeah, he's got a new song on iTunes.  The Keeper.  Oh, right on.  Should we play it now?  That's all I need.  You want to play it now?  We'd like to hear it, maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  Why not?  Play that motherfucker.  That's why. 
[00:45:30]  We'll play this motherfucker.  Golden Jam.  Mi nombre es Chris Cornell.  Chris Cornell, The Keeper.  He'll be in in a couple hours.  Check this out.  I come from far away.  My boots don't know this ground.  They know it's real.  It doesn't take too long for this world to become a battlefield. 
[00:46:00]  And before I let one more fire go out, understand that I won't give one inch of ground from beneath.  Yours and I'll feed whatever the price happens to be. 
[00:46:30]  I may not be the keeper of the flame.  But I am the keeper.  Beauty and truth collide  Where love meets genocide 
[00:47:00]  Where laughter meets fear  Confusion all around  As I try to feel these mouths  That have never known singing  And before I let one more tear hit the ground  I would be the one standing between you  And the sound of the rounds  Echoing out, out of the dark 
[00:47:30]  The smoke and the spark  And at the heart of the flame  I am the keeper  I cannot see the light  At the end of the tunnel tonight 
[00:48:00]  My eyes are weary  And before I let one more life get erased  From the ashes I will rise for you  And the ghosts are the names  The faces and frames  The love and the pain  And for you I'll remain  Though I'm not worthy of  Being the keeper of the flame 
[00:48:30]  I am the keeper  I am the keeper  Sirius XM 
[00:49:00]  The virus  Hey, good girls, your daddy home 
[00:49:30]  Don't tell me if you're all alone  There's a bad desire  Oh, I'm on fire  Tell me how this baby is good to you  Or do these things I like  Can we get a few higher 
[00:50:00]  Oh, I'm on fire  Sometimes I'm shot somewhere in life  Ah  Sinch but  You know the road too  Ah  Ah  Hmm  Now that I wake up in the  The light  Turns out the shadow  Me  Keep her most tired 
[00:50:30]  Oh, I'm on fire  Oh, I'm on fire  Oh, I'm on fire  Oh, I'm on fire 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, happy birthday, Bruce Springsteen. 
[00:51:30]  Where's Roland?  Is he excited for the big Bruce Springsteen birthday?  Does he got a cake?  He's got his dumb Jets shirt on today.  You would think he would go Bruce Springsteen.  Jets, New York Jets.  Jets, New York Jets.  Springsteen's 62 years old?  Holy shit.  Are you serious?  Yeah, and he's touring next year.  What?  He's touring a new album.  Oh.  Bruce.  Why are you so chill today, man?  Bruce.  Because I'm so hot.  I had to wait in the subway for a half hour.  Thank you, MTA. 
[00:52:00]  Why?  It never showed up, the train.  I just decided not to show up.  I just started sweating, and one of them goes, you look hot.  You sweat a lot, though, because your body temperature's like crazy.  Yeah.  It's hot.  What do you eat for breakfast?  Rugs?  He got it.  In the middle of the winter.  We've seen him rolling in the middle of the winter in a t-shirt.  He's always warm.  All right.  I don't know why you're not wearing the Bruce Springsteen shirt today.  You're not represented. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  You don't care about his birthday?  I guess you don't care.  The shirt's too thick.  I've been passed out by now.  All right.  Are you wearing shorts?  Yeah.  Fucking Roland.  Oh, he'll be wearing shorts.  Winter.  Close to January, he still wears shorts.  Easy.  That's easy for him.  Is it a disease?  No.  It's called, I eat too much.  No, that wouldn't make you need no jacket since winter.  He's got a hot body temperature.  Patrice O'Neill in the studio.  I went to a Rangers game with him once, and we had a meet on the corner.  And it was one of these fucking cold New York fucking nights. 
[00:53:00]  I had a hat on, a winter coat.  I was kind of cold.  He shows up like that.  I'm like, are you serious?  That's what I'm asking.  It's a disease.  It has to be.  He shows up in.  It's a kind of heat disease, and he's not paying attention to it.  Yeah, you got some glandular problem.  Lavitus.  It was snowing, and he's got a t-shirt and shorts on.  I'm like, what are you?  That's crazy.  That's crazy, man.  It is.  I've seen you dressed in t-shirts when it's winter out.  That's just not.  Get that checked out. 
[00:53:30]  Really?  Exactly.  Something's going on.  You know, internally hot and shit.  Making a bunch of ice cubes into a hat.  I hate when Patrice walks in while the commercials are on, because then he does like 20 minutes  of shit that could have been for the radio.  It could have been, but I got more.  All right, you got more?  I'll have another fucking, yeah.  You'll make more?  I'll make more.  I got a story about how William Shatner and his wife almost made me cry. 
[00:54:00]  Really?  Oh, shit.  You got all sensitive?  For real, yeah.  Like, all those guys.  Well, can we get this out of the way?  What?  You killed on the roast.  All right, thank you.  And people need to hear that out there.  Thank you.  You killed on the Charlie Sheen roast.  And I know maybe you don't like the compliments here and there.  Nah, enjoy the compliments.  All right.  You fucking...  He just doesn't recognize them when they come.  You fucking destroyed.  What'd you say, motherfucker, I was good?  What'd you try to say?  You destroyed it, man.  You really did.  I appreciate it.  I'm glad it came off.  In the room, I was comfortable. 
[00:54:30]  But then the editing, I was like, oh, boy.  Oh, like, oh, shit.  Did they fuck you over too bad?  Not if people thought I was good.  Yeah, yeah, it was good.  No, no, I thought it was good.  And the stuff they left out, I don't know if that would have made it any better.  But, you know, the whole set was in the room, was...  I did about 10 minutes, maybe 15.  Yeah.  Because I had to.  Because, you know, they would set me up for two to the back of the head.  Like, they wouldn't set me up for fucking...  They wasn't giving me a fucking Schumer or a Jezelnik set up. 
[00:55:00]  They was giving me...  Because the station knows my pedigree as a comic.  But here's something I didn't know until I walked out in the pre-intros of the dais.  Nobody knows me.  So I'm in a Hollywood crowd with big, funny-faced Dog the Bounty Hunter and Joe from the wheelchair and the family guy.  And they're just like...  And I'm the only nigga on the ropes, right? 
[00:55:30]  He is a goofy-looking motherfucker.  Big hair plugs and shit.  Oh, yeah.  And they've sent me...  They come out, and I'm always used to at least half of people going, hey!  Yeah, hey, hey, it's Patrice.  Hey, it's me, right?  Yeah.  Coming out, works all over town.  You know, Seth was bringing everybody out.  So he's like, hey, you know, works all around, working comic, very funny guy, Patrice O'Neal.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that's... 
[00:56:00]  So I'm the only black guy in this Hollywood.  Nobody know me.  And why that's important is, oh, he's the black guy on the roast.  All right, must be an interesting young man.  And then I said, listen, they gave me a couple of days' notice to do it.  I didn't have a month, which I should have had.  I had about three days.  Jesus.  And I only really got into it on the plane, flying there on Friday.  The roast was Saturday.  So I said, just don't put me last. 
[00:56:30]  Because, I mean, there's no reason to put me last.  Okay.  All right, sure.  That's what, fat boy.  You're going last, motherfucker.  I should have said, I need to go last.  They would have put me on.  Then they would have put me on first, where John Lovitz went, which is a rough one.  First is easy.  They knew me as a comic that could go last, but it was a bad, it was a setup.  Yeah.  Because no one in the audience knew me.  So by the time I come up, oh, he's a black guy, and he's doing the coveted Lisa Lampanelli last spot.  Who is this young man? 
[00:57:00]  So I had to go, and this is the thing.  If I had a bomb, it would have set me back five years.  I would have never seen y'all again.  I would have found another job, because I would have had to make a comeback at the age of 48.  Because if I had ate my balls, I would have had to hide, I would have had to be on stage pretending I had confidence.  But there would have been none.  Somebody would have been like, why couldn't you be funny like that on a roast?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:57:30]  And then I got to explain, no, they don't understand.  So I had to pull out 20 years.  This was a, I had to prove myself.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm used to being able to just chill and work out my mind.  And I had to prove myself.  And now, okay, I did well, but it was like, oh, yeah, that's what he does.  But if I bombed, whew.  So I had to actually muster up all my experience as a comic. 
[00:58:00]  Jesus.  So I had to play for the room.  I had to, because if I, and they got mad at me, the truck, because it was, it was, hey, you know, you're, you got AIDS and your eyes are bleeding.  Like, it is, and look at John Lovitz.  He's a piece of shit.  And just, boy, your fucking head is, you know, you have diabetes.  Yeah, yeah.  Grape soda.  Like, it's just like, the motherfuckers' heads was going like this, up and down. 
[00:58:30]  So I'm up there, like, if I had to did what I had prepared, because they needed it, they wanted it on the monitor.  I get up there after William Shatner was racist.  Because, in a funny way, I'm like, all right, that's it, you know, I'm going to have to be a comic.  I can't do, and then, Seth MacFarlane, you.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't do it.  So I had to half wing it, half material.  And the material give you the confidence to wing it. 
[00:59:00]  So that's why I was winging it, and it was going well.  Then I go, oh, okay, I also got some jokes I prepared.  So a lot of it was just ranting on the phony Hollywood thing, because they decided it was no disease day at the roast when they edited it.  Everybody said some disease jokes.  Not just, except for diabetes.  That was allowed.  You know, diabetes is a joke.  It's a lot of things.  Yeah.  But, like, Jeff Ross said a fucking funny joke. 
[00:59:30]  He says to me, Patrice, you said you'll never do one of these roasts.  You're a sickle sellout.  That's hilarious.  Hilarious.  So when I was up, I was like, Jesus, I hope you get Tay-Sachs disease, right?  Which is a Jew disease.  Yeah.  And Crohn's.  But it was a great ad-lib, because I go, I hope you get Crohn's disease so it can stop some of that shit from coming out.  So we had a good time.  Cut that shit out.  All that shit got cut out. 
[01:00:00]  Were they afraid of disease people calling?  All of that shit got cut out.  Down syndrome I heard got cut out or beeped.  Everything.  Everything that had to do with any diseases.  I mean, Steve-O's whole act got cut out.  It was just...  See?  Assuming he's retarded.  You know, it was a rough one, but it was like, you know, I still...  I did it because of Charlie.  Like, I did it because I wanted to meet the guy.  I thought he was like, you gotta meet this fucking guy.  And let's not be self-righteous.  They was planning on it being the biggest rated whatever.  Yeah.  And it was paying some good help.  10 million people. 
[01:00:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  So I said, all right, I'll do that fucking thing.  Fuck it.  But the hard thing was not to sabotage it, because it was not set up for you to do well.  Yeah, yeah.  You had everything against you on that one.  Like, you walk in and think you're gonna...  They're like, Dave Patrice, we love you.  Come on, do it.  And then it's...  You come in the room and there's plastic on the ground.  Like...  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Are they still trying to destroy my career? 
[01:01:00]  By allowing Anthony Giselle to be famous?  Don't do that.  Don't do that.  Like, County Central, they fucking tell people they're gonna be famous.  You see, Whitney Cummins, that bitch, is a showrunner on two shows.  Yeah.  Who the fuck has ever heard of that?  It's crazy.  That's insanity.  It's unheard of.  And I'm not mad at the bitch.  It's just... 
[01:01:30]  It's...  I'm trying to get...  I'm trying to get on True TV.  Hey, this bitch is showrunning on the two major networks.  I'm surprised more of you guys don't kill yourselves.  Yeah, right?  I'm not even...  You know what I mean?  You're way more talented than Whitney Cummings, I'll say it.  And it's...  And she's got two huge shows that you're trying to get on.  You know what it feels like?  You're familiar with Donnie Brasco, of course, right? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yes.  It's the movie.  Yeah.  You feel like Rogerio.  What's his name?  Lefty?  Yeah.  You feel like Lefty because you go...  I shoot my best friend in the back of the head.  Yeah.  I fucking...  When I think I'm gonna be murdered, I show up.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I'm down with the game.  But people...  People just that haven't earned it...  I think it's like being...  Or even Platoon, the guy who was running Sergeant Barnes Platoon.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the lieutenant. 
[01:02:30]  But Sergeant Barnes is, like, smacking him in the head with a phone.  Like, you dumb motherfucker.  That's how you feel, like...  You're fucked up, fire mission!  You cut up!  And you're doing four or five turns of duty!  And this bitch got two shows!  The lefty's a good analogy, though, because the whole career you feel like you're pulling  a fucking hundred out of a card that says to a friend of ours and ripping it in half.  Every time somebody gets something, you rip your card up.  You know, so again, it's not nothing against her.  I'm just...  She just represents something.  Well, okay, because I was going to ask you, what is that about? 
[01:03:00]  Because, no joke, you're way, way more fucking funny than her.  Dude, I bet you...  Jimmy, of course, is in the same boat, and you guys have a tough time trying to get these  big fucking projects.  I don't know who the peers are of Roseanne or Brett Butler, but I bet you they weren't  like, what?  When Roseanne got her shit.  Because she earned it, it seemed like.  It seemed like Roseanne did the rounds, or Margaret Cho did the rounds, or Janine Goliath. 
[01:03:30]  They did the...  But you go...  You go...  You go...  I think the anger is that a lot of people don't feel like she's...  She got that spot.  There is anger.  Oof.  Well, but it's not anger towards her in particular.  It's anger because the business says, here's who's...  This is...  Look, here's my sabotage mindset.  I had to fight the thing, like, really?  Like, after I did well.  Really?  Like, this just validated me? 
[01:04:00]  Jesus, Patrice.  Patrice just can't.  Dude, I didn't do it, though.  I didn't do it.  I'm telling you, motherfuckers.  Right, right, yeah.  But in my head, I had to fight that.  I had to fight, you know, a couple of Twitter people.  Oh, this guy's pretty good.  What did you just say to me?  What did you just...  Did you just say you're gonna follow me?  Do you know I block people on a regular basis?  I don't need you.  Just mad.  But I curbed that.  I did.  But that's my instinct is to go, if I ate my balls on this show... 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's a setback.  If I kill, it's just par for the course.  It's just, well, you know...  Fame didn't call.  I was still walking through Marshalls yesterday.  Fame didn't call?  It didn't call, yeah.  I got my phone.  What the fuck's going on with Fame?  I think Fame...  It doesn't have your phone number.  It has my Twitter account.  It has your Twitter account.  No, but Fame is called a lot, and he's...  Fame is tired of being hung up on.  You're not Fame.  And cursed out.  What do you want?  Click.  But I certainly...  I walked through Marshalls yesterday. 
[01:05:00]  That's funny.  I certainly didn't do anything bad.  Was there a little tick up?  What do you mean?  Oh, yeah.  After the roast, where...  Yeah, 10 million people watched it.  I don't know where it ticks up.  I don't think...  It wasn't a huge jump, obviously.  It wasn't like...  I'm not famous, because I...  You know, but...  That's pretty fucked up.  But 10 million people saw it, so what it is...  I think in the industry, too, it might have upped it, because that's who it was...  That's who was validated for.  Right.  So everybody that already knows me from being a good comic just decided I was a good comic. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  At this particular thing.  You talked to Charlie Sheen?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is he a cool guy?  He's very cool, man.  Very funny.  Very cool.  But it was his night, so it wasn't...  You know, I don't like that feeling of bothering a guy.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was a thank you.  It was pleasantries.  It was this and that.  And then, boom.  How did Tyson treat you?  Tyson was cool.  Tyson's...  Does he know you?  No.  He's a hood guy.  Like, Tyson's very hood.  Yeah.  So Tyson gave me to size my body up, Pat, when he met me. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, did he?  To see if he'd fuck me up.  You see, he'd size...  That's what they do in the hood.  God damn.  He said, hey, man, how you doing?  He shook me to see how easy it would be to put me through a wall.  How stout you are, yeah.  How solid are you?  Oh, wow.  To put you through a wall.  That shit goes on?  Is that the move?  It was hood shit.  So...  You think he realizes he's doing it, or it's just such a habit when he meets somebody?  It's a habit when you're from...  He's from Brooklyn, and he was a thug.  Yeah, yeah.  So he would know who he'd fuck with.  So you just kind of give him a little shake.  Is that also a dominance thing, too, where you know you can shake a guy like that? 
[01:06:30]  Like, that's a...  But he wouldn't do that to you.  He wouldn't do that to...  Because he knows better.  Yes, he knows.  He wouldn't even...  I don't know if he would do it to a white guy, but he wouldn't do it to...  So he's like, what's up, bitch?  But he knows he could lay me into a fucking wall.  Yeah, exactly.  He was doing an interview with the workaholics kids, and he was like, ah, and he's done.  He goes, ah, what's up, that big nigga right there?  And he just shook my hand.  Crack, shake, shake your shoulders, and I go, I want to go, niggas, don't. 
[01:07:00]  We have to roast.  Stop trying to rob me, motherfucker.  Is he intimidating?  When you see him?  His legend is.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't have that boundary between professional and civilian.  Like, you know if you really bother him, he would punch you.  Well, I said, they played it on the roast, but I even went further where I was just like,  I don't like the feeling of not being afraid of Mike Tyson.  So white people put me in a bad spot by having him singing and clapping at pigeons to make me think that he ain't Mike Tyson. 
[01:07:30]  He's not going to beat your ass.  And on a street level, he'll beat you down.  Yep.  You know, he can fight, you know?  That's why they always kill me when they say he's a bully.  How can you be a bully when you beat up people for a living?  Like, you beat up other guys that beat up people for their profession.  Yeah.  So he can't be a bully.  Who said he was a bully?  I never heard that.  You've never heard them say Mike Tyson is a bully?  No.  Yes.  I've heard them say he fought bad fighters. 
[01:08:00]  No.  They call him a bully.  Mike Tyson, once someone stands up, once someone stands up to him, he actually whoops ass.  That's what he does.  He's not a bully.  You know?  So he was, you know, you felt that vibe.  But he was still a cool dude.  He wasn't, you know, he didn't do anything.  But I'd say, oh, this guy's from the street big time.  Because he, I haven't did that in a long time.  Size a guy up and shake him up.  Sizing up.  I just learned something new right there.  Yeah, no clue.  If a guy touches you and starts moving you around, he's sizing you up. 
[01:08:30]  What's the William Shatner story?  Wow.  Oh!  You said, uh.  I love William Shatner.  William Shatner loved me.  We love him.  He's going to be on again soon.  That's right.  He's really human, man.  Really a human guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And he was with his wife.  And after the show, I'm kind of in that, okay, what just, I was in a fog the whole time.  Because I was, I didn't sleep.  It was weird.  You know, you're just there telling, people telling you to walk here and walk there.  Yeah, yeah.  You're trying to be yourself.  And it's like, what happens to being yourself?  You know, some cunt camera lady is mad.  Because you actually see the bitch not give a fuck about you. 
[01:09:00]  That's the thing in the red carpet shit, all that shit.  You walk down, put your knees.  You go, oh, okay, hey.  And then one bitch go, and she's looking at, hey, cunt.  Just fucking pretend you're looking at me, right?  Fuck you, yeah.  But you can't do that shit.  We played it on the show.  What did he say to somebody on the red carpet?  It was pretty funny.  You were just like, you weren't going to play, man.  Right, that's what I was trying to play.  But when I, the way you play, that's not how you do it.  And then you find out what that means when you fuck with them.  Yeah.  They leave you out. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  They're like, roasters included.  Fucking Big Bird from Sesame Street.  I'm like, he wasn't on the roast.  Nope, but trees, yeah.  Nothing.  Do you like stopping for your picture when you walk?  I hate stopping.  No.  I'm terrified that no one wants my photo.  Well, no one does if you're not stopping.  It's scary.  I'm going to walk right through behind a publicist and just keep going.  It scares me to death to stop.  That's what, there'll be somebody that, and then you'll go, then the publicist will be like,  Patrice O'Neal is here. 
[01:10:00]  And they just start fixing issues.  Humiliating.  And then some Turkish reporter goes, give me some of the jokes, you bitch, die.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You're fucking, you're turban, just get out of here.  I'm fucking turban weekly.  It's like, don't tell anyone I'm here.  Yeah, it's embarrassing.  If they recognize, that's good.  It is embarrassing.  They're waiting for fucking Charlie Sheen.  Yes.  So you go out and you give her some, and then you got to know what to say, because they'll 
[01:10:30]  take a soundbite and say, Patrice O'Neal said, Charlie Sheen's breath stinks.  Yeah.  And that'll be it.  So you understand, like, when you watch interviews, and they're just like, this sucks.  It's because they just don't, you don't want to bother getting in trouble for being you.  Yeah.  So anyway, and I fucking had a thing with the workaholics kids.  I was really, I had anxiety.  I couldn't, I had no patience.  Because the workaholics kids are, and it's not against them, they're just these new breed 
[01:11:00]  of white guys who don't care.  That's their thing.  So it's like, hey, what's your name?  My name's Superman.  Oh, so what do you do?  Well, I fucking save the earth on a regular basis.  I actually kick-started the sun and turned time back to save people.  Hipster fucking bullshit.  Yeah, man.  Is that the detached fucking phony?  Yeah.  Wait, I never heard of this.  I never did either.  The workaholics.  Fuck you.  What is it?  I can't believe they showed it, because they edited it so that it's actually fun, because 
[01:11:30]  it didn't end well.  Really?  He's like, hey, what's going on?  But I don't even know what this is.  It's these kids, they're in a comedy troupe, and Comedy Central gave them a show called  Workaholics.  Look at his face.  But it's like, they're pushing.  The frozen face.  Look at this.  There's nothing worse than that frozen fucking face.  Like, he's not impressed by me?  Like, he don't need to be a fucker, but...  Okay, so they have a show on Comedy Central, and then they wrap the roast.  Comedy Central wanted to push him, so they let them do the interviews on the red carpet.  All right, turn that a little bit, sweetie.  You want to see it?  Yeah, I want to see his face. 
[01:12:00]  Frozen face.  Oof.  Look at him.  We're on the push play in this fucking thing.  Who are you, Dan?  Oh, God.  Let me turn it back to the beginning.  Yeah, how about you find me?  No, you don't, Sam.  Stop ruining everything.  Oh, Sam.  Suck.  You're doing my very best.  Look at this.  Yo, guys, I'm kind of here with Patrice O'Neal, more or less.  What's up, dude?  I'm kind of...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.  What was that?  What did that even mean?  I'm kind of here with Patrice O'Neal, more or less.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know, man.  But they should have warned me that this is his character so I could be... 
[01:12:30]  Fuck that guy.  Does the show do well?  I don't know.  It's new.  It hasn't done well.  Like, it's not a big show right now.  No one knows about it.  All right, hit it.  Down-ass chick right there.  My pants just moved.  Anders, go ahead.  Yo, guys, I'm kind of here with Patrice O'Neal, more or less.  What's up, dude?  How you doing?  Good, man.  Good.  You going to walk out of here with the statue or no?  Of what?  These women.  No.  Like, nah, I don't think so.  Nah, they're not even allowed to talk. 
[01:13:00]  It's all cocaine on them.  You know that, right?  Why does every white guy like the nude characters?  I don't give a shit.  Hey, don't f*** this guy.  He's like, so what's the deal, man?  Taking on the statue?  F*** it.  I'm trying to make it work.  Let's do it again.  I'm here with Patrice O'Neal being a white man.  F***ing great guy.  I don't care, man.  I don't get it.  What's wrong with the f***ing society?  That's my job, to be f***ing angry.  It's been real.  Back to you guys.  And I knew that was sarcasm somehow. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, thanks, Anders.  We're with Seth MacFarlane.  I don't know why they showed it.  Oh, thank God they did.  You called that motherfucker out.  F*** him.  F*** this stupid show.  It was not pleasant.  You called him out for being fake.  The line about why is every character, I don't care, it's a weird, that's an exposing line.  That's embarrassing when someone calls you out on that.  Good for Patrice.  That's embarrassing.  I'm surprised they showed that to him.  I don't care, but I could be here, I could be f***ing at a coffee place, I don't care, 
[01:14:00]  whatever.  I'm here with this guy, Patrice, I got a mic.  Because they don't connect with you at all.  No, no.  They don't know how to connect with you, they don't know how to connect, so they think that  just being stiff and frozen was a good word, and detached makes them seem like they're  unattainable when they don't know how to connect.  So you're going to walk away with one of these statues?  Now, riff on that.  I just gave you something.  Be funny now.  I don't care.  Really?  Be funny?  Yeah?  Good for you, man.  How about you have some interviewing skills, you f***ing a**hole? 
[01:14:30]  And I'm walking through with anxiety, so whatever you can do to go, well, hey, Patrice, let's  look at it from his point of view.  Yeah.  Look at it from my point of view.  Dude, I'm in this situation with a day's notice.  Yeah.  And I'm nervous about my jacket, and you're going, please just don't attack what I'm already  self-conscious about.  Because I had a t-shirt and a sparkly jacket.  That was my red carpet.  Right.  I thought that was leather.  I swear to God, I thought that was leather.  That's a sparkly? 
[01:15:00]  Let me see.  Well, it looks like it's leather.  It looks like a leather jacket.  It's some kind of denim or something.  Oh.  So, I'm hoping everything is going well with my clothing, so.  Why were you, wait, did you bring that or did they gave that to you?  Why were you nervous?  No, they f***ing gave, I brought it.  Meaning, I'm like, okay, cool, I'm hoping I look, you know.  Oh, okay.  So, my mind is like, alright, don't f*** up.  Yeah.  That's shit.  Just go along.  That's what I was trying to do.  Do the right thing.  And you get that.  The last person you'd want on that line would be Keith Robinson. 
[01:15:30]  How f***ing fast.  Oh, my God.  What's that jacket, stupid?  Look at that f***ing jacket.  What the f***a, you got that on?  It was two.  Are you dressed up for this shit?  Oh, he just ruined you before you walked in the door.  Ross got me.  They didn't play it.  They didn't play it.  I don't know why.  Ross was in the room.  Yeah.  Ross was phenomenal.  Yeah.  He goes, Patrice, why are you dressed like a gay umpire?  I don't know.  But here's the one.  Here's the one Bobby said when I was talking to him on the phone that would have hurt me. 
[01:16:00]  It would have struck me.  And I would have had to get that out of my...  Oh, shit.  He said, you look like Janet Jackson from Rhythm Nation.  If someone had said that to me, I would have really had to...  I would have been mad.  Like, f***ing damn.  Yeah, yeah.  You would have had to get out of that one.  It would have been rough.  You're just glad none of your friends were around.  You were happy to be doing that by yourself.  They would have just laughed at me.  They would have just laughed at me. 
[01:16:30]  Ah, that's hilarious.  So I was trying to keep...  I was trying to not f*** up that roast.  I was trying to not make anybody's job hard, like usual.  But then they put these kids, who are probably 20, with confidence that they gave them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's like, again, man, I'm a made guy.  Like, where I go, I can hold my...  In any of these f***ing burrows.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's...  There's...  Josh Jackson.  Rhythm Nation.  Oh, shit. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  No f***ing way.  No one said it.  No one said it, thank God.  Because I would have said, you f***ing f***ers.  That would have hurt.  God.  We got a guy...  That's a f***ing good one.  We got a guy sticking up for workaholics, saying funny as hell.  Oh, yeah.  Fine, if you like it.  I don't care.  Yeah, right.  I'm not against you thinking that they're funny.  Yeah, that's fine.  I don't get it.  I don't...  Like, I'm not into I don't care guy.  No one I know that's of a certain age.  Any comic. 
[01:17:30]  It is like this character of slow-moving confidence.  Yeah.  Dude, if you walk somewhere in this city or in LA or whatever where there's some f***ing  hardened comics who's been chopping the right way, people kind of know them, people kind  of don't, but they've always fucking hitting home runs, and this kid is like, so who are  you?  What are you?  Yeah.  I'm going to kind of hear more or less with him.  I don't care if he's intimidated and that's how his thing is, but I'm in a bad way. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  You know, act right.  You can't play along with that shit.  I can't.  That's not your thing.  And none of those guys are...  I've noticed not one of those type of mentality guys has ever made me laugh in person, and  not one of those guys I've ever thought was funny off the cuff on the air, or I wouldn't  mind it so much, but it really is uncomfortableness, and they think that by being stone-faced, they're  hiding the fact that they're scared.  Yeah.  It's like the hipsters who are pretending that they think they're nerds when they really 
[01:18:30]  know they're much better looking than nerds, and they have a lot more money than fucking  nerds do, but they're trying to be something funny.  There's too much thought behind it.  Yeah, it's planned.  It's not natural.  Just ask me to go along.  Yeah.  Like, just say, hey, Patrice, they do this thing.  This is my thing.  Yeah.  And it's like, hey, man, you know, hey, dude.  It's like, okay, no problem.  I could have been like, just, then I could be in my world, you could be in yours, but  that whole thing where you're not preparing me to be, you know, not disrespected, but  like, really? 
[01:19:00]  What are you doing?  I think it was like a disrespect kind of a thing.  Like, he probably is sitting there going, yeah, yeah, but if that's his character, he  probably did that with everybody.  Did he?  Yeah, but so fucking what?  But I mean, that's not a personal disrespect.  No, no, I didn't take it like that, but I'm just like, whatever your character is, it  should be prepared just in case.  But that's what I'm saying.  Like, so on the road's going last, if you're that guy, in a situation where the room has  been there for three hours and this and that, and they have to set you up for success because 
[01:19:30]  your thing is, hey, this is what I do and I'm not going to not do it, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who are you?  Oh, interesting.  Yeah, more or less.  William Shatner.  Oh, William Shatner.  I'm still trying to get you to do the William Shatner.  He fucking, him and his wife.  Yeah.  So he's talking to me after he goes Patrice.  Oh, fantastic.  All right.  I go, thank you, sir.  He goes, yeah, very good. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, it was, it was, wow.  Yeah.  I was like, like, truly liking the fact William Shatner's like into me, right?  Captain Kirk.  So we're walking and everybody's getting in their cars.  Whoever's going to the after party, the after party's on site and whoever's going home is  going home.  So him and his wife are kind of going home.  I think her name is Liz.  So him and Liz was coming and he was, Liz, you know, they love each other, you know, old  white couple that love each other.  They just.  He's 80 something.  They're amazing.  And she might be in her fifties, maybe.  Something like that.  Chippy.  Nice, you know, Hollywood looking, you know, good looking lady, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:20:30]  You know, whatever.  So they're talking and he goes, oh, and I go, hey man.  She says, do you have fun?  I just, I said, I'm starting to have fun.  This was after.  I was like, I think I am.  You're starting to relax.  I'm starting to relax.  And he goes, oh, okay.  Well, try to relax.  You know, I said, I'm trying.  I'm trying so hard, man, but I can't stop being miserable.  I'm so trying not to be miserable.  He goes, oh.  And here comes his wife.  Hi.  Oh.  He goes, honey, honey, didn't you think Patrice was great? 
[01:21:00]  She said, yeah.  Wasn't he your favorite?  No.  Oh, Jeff Ross was, you know.  So he was super honest, right?  Yeah.  So she starts, he goes, honey, I'm just talking to Patrice about being, you know, miserable  and trying to be happy.  And she goes, oh, you know, it's probably testosterone, right?  And she goes, you know, when guys start to lose their testosterone, because that's what  makes them go, they get angry.  And I'm like, hmm. 
[01:21:30]  And then he goes, but honey, Patrice.  She goes, but he shouldn't worry about that because he's young.  He goes, but honey, Patrice has diabetes.  And that stops you from producing all the things you need in your body.  And she goes, oh, that's probably why he's so terrible.  Oh, my God.  This conversation with each other about how my body is breaking down.  Oh, my God.  It's breaking down.  And I have less testosterone and less madness. 
[01:22:00]  But they weren't being cruel.  No, it was just, oh, he's sick and can't produce.  And she's like, yeah.  And so he gives me a hug.  You were great, young man.  Gets in their fucking limo, and I'm welling up.  You're like, motherfucker.  Because I'm realizing, oh, God, it's not just, I'm just an angry dude.  My body's making me angry.  My testosterone is gone.  Leave the poor man alone.  He's had enough. 
[01:22:30]  And I'm like, I'm just.  Bones, Bones, check him out.  He's on death's door.  They had a 10-minute conversation.  Oh, my God.  Right in front of you.  Why I was just miserable.  And it was so, it was human.  It wasn't.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't trying to hurt me.  It was just trying.  It was just like.  Oh.  That's funny.  Take care of yourself.  Hope I made your night better.  Liz is like, bye.  I'll bet you they have to.  I'll bet you they have that conversation with everybody. 
[01:23:00]  They find something.  I'll bet you they're like, oh, we got him pretty good.  They leave laughing.  They probably do that to Jeff Ross about something else.  Well, you're a Jew.  Jews aren't supposed to feel good after 30 minutes.  Jeff's crying.  My eyes was blowing up.  Shatner's wife laughing.  I'm not lying.  Because it was like, I started going, is that it?  Because I'd be like, I'd be mad all the fucking time.  And I'm like, is it my testosterone is going?  And she just was like, now you know how it feels about menopause. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, damn.  She was saying.  Yeah.  Because she was like, that's what happens to women.  Menopause makes us miserable.  Why doesn't Bill Shatner talk to people who've known you for 15 years?  You're the exact same guy I met 15 years ago.  That's not true.  What do you think?  You were charming when we met and all of a sudden you got angry?  You've been terrible for a long time.  Norton keeps saying we, I was on Norton's side when we first met.  The only time I hated Norton at any point, we drove to Sackett's Harbor or Sags Harbor.  And he cuddled with his girlfriend the whole time and ignored me. 
[01:24:00]  Like, I was like, this will be fun.  I like Norton.  And he, you know, Norton falls in love with anything.  Yeah, this was, I was, I was 1999.  And he just, he just cuddles up.  So the whole ride up to this shitty place for six hours was Norton licking his girl's ear and driving.  And I'm in the back like fucking reverse Miss Daisy.  He's just like, hey, let's talk about something.  He's like, but it's because I guess he hated me from this gig we did.  I never hated you.  I was kidding.  I liked you a lot.  I'm just telling you you weren't pleasant.  I don't think I'm unpleasant.  I know you don't. 
[01:24:30]  No one's unpleasant.  Everything's so unpleasant.  Did you see the roast?  Cancer doesn't know it's cancer.  That was the least.  It just is.  It just is.  That was the least mean.  The least mean on the fucking roast.  But that's how we are.  Yeah.  If you listen to our roast, the roast that we, that they did a meal, the roast, the Voss roast or the Norton roast.  It would, it's, you can hear, it's, it's love.  Yeah.  It's your friend's roast.  Definitely.  Yeah.  It's not, it's not evil.  It's your friend.  It's fun somehow. 
[01:25:00]  And, and I'm just saying this thing is, it was, how, how much can you say awful to people you don't know?  That, yeah, that does come across like that now on the, uh, the roast they do these days.  They could have joked, somebody called John Lovitz.  I'm not saying who, but somebody, they just said, John Lovitz is a child molester.  And I'm just, and that was it.  And I'm like, I wonder what that means.  Is he?  And then they cut, they cut out, I don't know.  And then they, uh, Mike Tyson had to get a no rape clause. 
[01:25:30]  Can't talk about rape.  Oh, you really?  No, you can't do it.  He said, I'm not doing that.  You motherfuckers call me a rapist all day.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  That's why nobody hit that shit.  They, I was surprised they hit the prison shit a little bit.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  Because when somebody said, I think Lovitz said something about prison, like Iron Mike, that's  what they say to you in prison, in the prison laundry all the time.  He's like, ah, but you can see it's like, I don't know.  Like, all right, I told somebody, don't suck with me.  That's as far as you're going, little man.  Somebody's going to not, you know, do well.  He would knock some people out. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, hurt him.  But I don't think he would.  I think he would choke somebody up in the back.  In the back.  He'll hem somebody up.  But I don't think he would knock somebody out.  Yeah.  Because he wouldn't hit Steve-O.  Steve-O, I heard, wanted to get punched by Mike.  Yes.  Like actual, and Mike's like, I'm not punching you, dude.  No.  He said, well, can you just hold your fist out while I run into him?  And he ran into his fist.  He ran and busted his nose up.  His nose up.  But Mike, the Tyson thing and the, like Kate Walsh, you know, people are writing, you know, 
[01:26:30]  and she goes, well, Patrice, you know, grape soda is not a fruit.  You know.  Right.  Which is fine.  They all were fine.  That was fine to me.  But it was something that, you know, I'm like, ah, this is not, this is not cool, man.  I think some, I guess she might have had abortions or something, but somebody said something about her abortions.  Because, like, Kate Walsh had eight abortions, and she's trying to keep her head up, but it's like, you think this woman wants to hear about her abortions? 
[01:27:00]  She's got to know that when she shows up, though.  It's almost like, if you're Tyson, you can get that clause in there.  But most people, it's like, that's what it takes when you accept that.  Like, you kind of know that anything can be fucked with.  Especially if it's strangers that don't really know you.  Yeah, that's harder.  If you're shitting on each other, it's a little bit different because you know where it's coming from.  If you Wikipedia me and just say what you learned from Wikipedia and what you see on Google and what, it's just like, you can, my thing is I was trying to make a synopsis of what I saw of you as a person that I know as a person. 
[01:27:30]  Here's my synopsis of what you are, even though I don't know you.  But nothing personal like, hey, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I saw that your dog had pneumonia.  And I wish you had pneumonia instead of your dog.  Yeah, yeah.  Your dead doggy.  And you just go, woo, boy.  See, you got to just go for the good stuff.  Like, if I saw you there, I'd probably be like, look at all those rings. 
[01:28:00]  What are you, starting a ring store or something?  Which would have been better?  I tell you, in the room, I love William.  I think William Shatner came out fantastic on TV.  Yeah.  And in the room, but Jeff Ross, from start to finish, in the room, was amazing.  Yeah.  I have to say, he was phenomenal.  He knew how to do it.  He didn't know how to do it.  He knows how to do that shit.  He's great at those.  He knew how to do it, man. 
[01:28:30]  He knows how to do that shit.  And Amy in the room killed, too.  Yeah, yeah.  She really crushed in the room.  Like, you know, she did her thing.  Yeah, she came off really well.  I have to say that.  I mean, I have to say, you know, so it's like, you know.  All right.  Why don't we break?  Why don't we do your set one last time before we move on?  It was very good.  We heard it.  Did you do it at any time?  Oh, you already did it?  Yeah, we did it this week.  Oh, I didn't know that.  We'll do it again, though.  For the Charlie Sheen roast, Patrice O'Neal, and a little later this morning, Chris Cornell  is coming in to say hi to us.  Allegedly.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  Allegedly?  No, I just like saying that.  No.  Thank you very much.  I, uh, it's strange because I had all this playing shit, but I didn't, like, I didn't  know William Shatner was going to be quasi, like, an old racist man.  Like, but, but everybody's giggling, like, oh, he's a butt.  You're a asshole, Captain Kirk.  What are you talking about?  Like, I don't respect him, but, like, I respect him because he's Captain Kirk. 
[01:29:30]  But I think he might be racist because his hair plugs look like black girls' hair.  This is amazing.  Like, I wasn't going to be mean to Anthony.  I don't know him.  I never met him.  Like, like, so I'm sitting here watching him, and I'm like, he has way too much confidence.  Like, in my world, he's an open mic, but nobody knows him.  And nobody should. 
[01:30:00]  Like, nobody should f***ing know Anthony.  Uh, I refuse to learn his last shitty name.  I learned Galifernakis.  That's the last shitty last name this f***ing gonna learn in this f***ing funky town.  He reminds me of a medieval restaurant waiter.  Like, his old demeanor, like, hello, may I welcome to... 
[01:30:30]  And you just want to go shut the f*** up and bring me my giant turkey leg, you f***ing nothing.  How the f*** can I be too mean after all this s***?  I can't believe it.  I'm dying of diabetes, and you motherf***ers are like, oh, that evil, fat f***, you know.  I consider Seth an icon.  I do.  Like, I got a critique about Seth. 
[01:31:00]  It's too much Seth.  It's...  Like, it's almost like he's jealous of his own creation.  Where he wants to prove I'm better than the cartoons.  But he's not better than the cartoons.  See, but I think the problem is with Seth, is that he don't have a partner.  You know, like the South Park guys or Hannah Barbera.  I know we've read that old story that, uh, Hannah once said, I'm bigger than Yogi, and Barbera slapped the s*** out of him for saying that. 
[01:31:30]  Seth needs a Barbera.  To slap him, and slap him twice.  Once, to say, hey man, don't forget why people love you.  And two, just say you're gay.  No.  No straight man writes that many show tunes.  That's a fact. 
[01:32:00]  I love Mike Tyson, and I don't have much to say.  I'm just disappointed and hurt at how much comfort white people have around you now.  I don't, I don't like it.  Thank you.  Steve-O, this new subdued, not drunk you, it s*** stinks, man.  Why are you still looking at me like that, Mr. Shatner, sir? 
[01:32:30]  You're like, boy, I had more for that s*** than I didn't say it.  I should have said it, because he's an a**hole.  You're telling it as it is.  You're telling it as it is.  Hey man, Jeff Ross, I love you, I guess.  Look, Jeff Ross is a legend.  His funniness is a legend, but when I say legend, I mean a myth.  Like the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot, like, we all believe they exist, but who really 
[01:33:00]  ever saw it?  Oh, s***.  I've turned down many roasts.  I have.  About three or four of them.  And I said yes to this, and I'm dead-ass serious, I said yes to this, because I respect Charlie  Sheen, I do.  I said yes, because I respect, not, not, not his body of work, like, not, it's all been 
[01:33:30]  very Christian Slayer-ish, like, it's just like, he sucks, but he's good, but he sucks at  the same time.  I think that his stand that he made, uh, against the business, I think this is a f***ed  up business, but he stood up, he, he still survived, uh, and he proved that nobody can  keep, like, a Sheen down, you know?  They can keep, uh, Estevez down, because his brother, and he's the good one, that m***h 
[01:34:00]  do everything right, and that s*** career is over, holy s***.  S*** tiger blood, he's selling his own blood to make money.  But I, I wanted to say to your eyes, man, I, I, I, I, I love that you stood up to what  you thought was wrong, and, uh, I'm impressed by you, and I wanted to say that. 
[01:34:30]  So, thank you, man, thanks for having me.  Y'all take care, thank you.  Sirius XM, the virus.  You'll be touching my vulva tonight.  Everybody.  You want to do it, do it, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be touching my vulva tonight.  You play, I'll be touching your vulva tonight.  Clean hands.  You'll be touching my vulva tonight.  And here come the lighters, the lighters are out. 
[01:35:00]  Everyone's swaying back and forth in concert.  Wit, clean, hand.  That's what it's all about.  And now a reading from the book of Ted.  When the wine was gone, Ted had his disciples fill the jugs with water, and then a miracle  occurred.  And Ted said, I took water, and I turned it into crystal light.  The wine was now crystal light.  When the food was gone, Ted's disciples gathered, and the Lord Ted proclaimed, I took a bunch of 
[01:35:30]  fishes and turned them into more fishes by cutting them in half.  I have 30 fishes, and I should, like, present E with 60 half fish.  It was the second miracle Ted had performed, and Ted then divided the fish among them.  I'm working miracles.  The king was not impressed, and ordered Ted to be arrested.  Oh, no, they misunderstood me.  Ted shouted as he tried to explain himself.  I had an erection.  It was tending out my robe beautifully. 
[01:36:00]  But the guards just ignored him, and Ted was taken away.  The Lord Ted was to be crucified.  Ow!  My hands and feet are hurting!  Ted shouted as the nails were driven into his flesh.  As the crowd looked on, Ted looked to the people and announced,  I have it!  I have it not!  You goeth forth!  Whatever that means, this has been a reading from the book of Ted.  Sirius XM.  This is the virus.  People are strange when you're a stranger. 
[01:36:30]  Faces look ugly when you're alone.  Women seem wicked when you're unwanted.  Streets are uneven.  Good song.  Any Doors fans in the room here?  Yeah, motherfucker.  I like the Doors.  Ah.  What's the anniversary?  44 years ago, people are strange.  He wrote this, what was it?  Walking up what?  44 years ago?  44 years ago.  He would have been 80?  Holy shit! 
[01:37:00]  44 years.  No, well he died at 27.  27 and 71, so that's 40 years, so yeah.  That guy would have been 71 years old.  No.  Oh man, come on.  How many years ago did he die?  When did he die?  71?  Well if this was...  71's 40 years ago.  67.  40 years, so 67.  Okay, he would have been 67.  He would be 67, yeah.  Yeah.  Shit.  Like one of the Wilburys.  Yeah.  We can't use that joke anymore.  Wilburys aren't around anymore.  It'd just be a good fucking go-to joke.  Patrice O'Neal in studio. 
[01:37:30]  Let me get the plug in for you, Patrice.  Stress Factory this weekend.  Tonight and Saturday, yeah, 732-545-ha-ha.  At the Stress Factory, Vinny's room.  Vinny said hi, by the way.  Fuck Vinny.  Oh yeah, Vinny.  Fuck him.  The guy takes care of us too, man.  He's got this collection of nobodies coming up that he can't move.  Who?  Vinny.  He can't push one of those guys aside for a little Jimmy Norton?  He will.  I don't know if he will.  We got Bob Peterson from Minneapolis. 
[01:38:00]  Vinny's still trying to figure out how to make his room less hack.  It looks like a TGI Fridays mixed with pictures of fucking Hammy Hammerstein.  He's got passion for what he does, though.  Here's the thing.  I tend to believe that I was in the lead pushers of him stopping to do that stupid phone call  in the show and stop showing videos of people hitting that groin.  You don't like the little jokes that would come up with them? 
[01:38:30]  Oh no, mom.  I know.  He's talking about the montage of videos.  Yeah.  With the babies puking and all that.  Don't show funny shit before the fucking funny show.  Just trying to get everyone in the mood.  Don't fucking show the guy hits his balls on the fucking, the pummel horse.  Oh!  Everybody makes a noise.  Oh no.  By the way, you're lucky I'm in here today, I just want to say.  Because they raised the fucking Holland Tunnel price.  No shit.  It's at $12.  Well, you have easy pass, don't you? 
[01:39:00]  No.  It doesn't go down, though.  Yeah, because it's only a $1.50 raise.  If it's only a $1.50 raise, you have easy pass.  They decided to really fuck the cash guys.  $4 for the cash guys, $1.50 for the easy pass guys.  Why don't you eat the amount of hours you waste?  No.  Why?  What's the problem with easy pass?  I don't know.  You don't know, but you know it's something, right?  No, it's not selling out to the man.  No, it's like a Tony Soprano thing.  Disconnect the fucking GPS on your vehicle.  You don't use easy pass.  You don't like people knowing where you are? 
[01:39:30]  I traded my car that had OnStar, man, just to get rid of it.  Get rid of it?  I heard some shit what's going on with OnStar.  What are they doing?  You hear that?  Well, apparently, you've got to read the new terms.  There's new terms for OnStar.  And they are allowed to track you, use your information to sell to other people where you are, where you go, things like that.  And even if you disconnect or say, I want to cancel my service, they can still collect information on where you are. 
[01:40:00]  How about how fast you're going?  Shit like that.  Right.  And then that information, not now, but could be in the future, sold to insurance companies, let's say.  Let's say the insurance company, you sign up for policy, and they go, well, let's check with the people that bought information from OnStar.  Well, what I'm seeing here is everywhere you go, you average 85 miles an hour.  Not going to ensure you.  That's going to hurt OnStar a lot. 
[01:40:30]  Well, you know what?  Good.  Scumbags.  The cat's out of the bag.  It just came out the other day.  Good.  That they're collecting this info, and they are selling it to other people.  That's fucking sickening.  You hear the guy that got fucking lost or divorced because they tracked his easy pass down.  Is that a true story?  It's an absolute, it seems like one of those urban legends they've heard over the years.  It's absolutely true story.  It's court admissible evidence, man.  That motherfucker was going to Brooklyn after work to fucking get his dick sucked, and they had it on fucking easy pass. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  And they collect your, if you go, if you're easy passing it, and the speed limit's 65,  and you get somewhere faster, they have the times.  So if you go from the GW to somewhere else, and it's supposed to take an hour, and it only took you fucking 40 minutes,  your speed limit.  They've been working on that.  But they don't do that.  I'll tell you, here's why I think.  Because you're afraid if they do it, everyone will get rid of easy pass.  Yeah.  I think they're afraid that if they start doing that, everybody will dump easy pass. 
[01:41:30]  No, because we won't.  We'll just eat the tickets.  Because we're punks.  We'll just eat the tickets.  You're right.  We are punks.  We will do what they make us do.  Right.  Listen, I was at the airport.  They don't want you asking questions.  This is the thing they're trying to get you used to.  Coming here one day, I was coming up 8th Ave.  They just shut 8th Ave down.  Yeah.  And they had the straight stormtroopers with the M-16s and the whole thing.  And no one even blinked.  It's like we're Stepford people.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  No one's even going, what the fuck's going on? 
[01:42:00]  What, are you going to get out and make a problem?  No.  But just the idea of what's going on.  So at the airport, I was flying on 9-11.  And all of a sudden, I'm putting on my shoes because I get checked all the time because  I won't go through the fucking x-ray.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because I hear, this could be urban legend, but I think I read it.  I actually, I did read it.  Is that the Logan Airport TSA people are getting cancer because they've had x-rays in there  in Logan since 9-11.  So they're being exposed to this fucking, this x-ray all the time. 
[01:42:30]  Well, they should.  People, the other people that let those motherfuckers in, shut up.  Yeah.  They actually said at one point, you forgot your box cutter.  You dropped it, sir.  Yeah.  So, so anyway, I'm there, I'm putting my shoes on and I just hear, go bravo, go bravo.  People running back and forth and you're like, what the fuck?  Can I need coffee?  And then I, evidently that was the code for, it was, it was the exact time that one of  the planes hit the building, I guess. 
[01:43:00]  And that's what they, what it was, code bravo.  They're screaming.  So they, then after everybody's, a girl, you know, a girl, a black girl's like, in remembrance  to the people who died in the World Trade Center, we will.  So it was nothing but a, an announcement to honor the people who died.  But I'm like, why couldn't you do that?  But they're screaming.  Why are they screaming?  Wait a minute.  So I, I see this kid, I'm walking.  I go, dude, let me ask you a question. 
[01:43:30]  And then if you put black bitches in charge of something, it's just, it's never easy going.  They love some power.  Can I help you, sir?  Oh, it's the worst to deal with.  I do, and I know black girls don't like this.  They don't like not acknowledging your face, finger wave.  Oh, so you don't look at their face, but you just wave their finger.  Do you need some help?  Nah.  So I'm asking the guy, I'm saying, let me ask you a question, man.  What was you guys just yelling?  Because I didn't understand.  I just heard screaming.  Oh, we was yelling code bravo because that was the code on, on 9-11. 
[01:44:00]  And, and that happened right then at the moment.  Oh, so that's why you were screaming.  And yeah, she came over, slinking over to put her little ear to hear what Scott, what did he ask you?  Like, it's like, they trying to get us into a place where we just don't question.  So back to what you think about the, the easy pass that it's like, ah, they wouldn't do that.  Cause people, we wouldn't, we're fucking pussies.  We take it in the ass cheeks all the time, all day long. 
[01:44:30]  And we like it.  So no, no, I still, I still think if they started giving out tickets and people started getting whacked with tickets for easy pass,  people would absolutely stop using those easy pass.  Well, guess why they wouldn't?  Cause they're phasing out these dumb toll booth people.  Exactly.  And that's why they get the worst.  Now there's going to be no alternative.  They get the worst toll booth people.  Be so that when they lose their job, you don't care.  Yeah.  You don't say, God, this fucking Haitian guy lost his job.  He's a dick.  That's that.  That's when you buy your fucking, you know, there's no more. 
[01:45:00]  But of the token agents in the subway and the last ones of those that are left are just sitting there fucking job of the hut,  sitting in those fucking booths and no one cares about them.  They want everything to be automated.  Mall parking.  No more tenders in mall parking.  You got to pay for it at the machine.  Period.  Pay for it.  And now everything.  And I've said this in the, in the past,  everything is presented to you as a convenience when it first comes out.  Look how convenient this is.  And I don't want to sound like a conspirator here, but things do end up being used against you. 
[01:45:30]  The convenience of easy pass, right?  Right.  The convenience of any other electric, GPS, things like that.  And then now, now I love this one.  It's just progressive commercials are showing the convenience of being able to put a unit that progressive will supply you with in your car.  That shows you, uh, the insurance company, what a safe driver you are and brings your rates down.  Because now they can monitor your speed and driving habits through this electronic device and be like, 
[01:46:00]  Hey, look at this.  Your driving safe will give you lower rates.  They don't mention the fact that if you get into an accident, they will pull every bit of info off of that and go,  Hey, fuck you.  We're not covering you.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  You were driving like an asshole.  Oh, here's the proof.  The little device we gave you, you know, to help you.  Of course.  Yeah.  But it's not always that way.  Because, like, look at your cell phones.  Have they been used to?  Yes.  How? 
[01:46:30]  You just don't know it.  What do you think?  I don't know if I mean, has it impacted you?  Not yet.  Not yet.  There's just now this other thing just came out.  Well, Apple, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What about the Apple situation?  They get in all kinds of class lawsuits because these fucking...  I got woke up today by a noise.  I downloaded this app.  It's like an Angry Birds app.  I'm trying to look for another Angry Birds.  We all are.  Who is it?  I got them crack.  Right.  So I woke up too early.  It was like 5.30.  I had my shit set for 6. 
[01:47:00]  It went...  And I'm looking.  It's the phone saying, hey, don't forget to play this game today.  Holy shit.  Oh, no shit.  Your phone's waking you up to play a game.  They say, don't forget to play.  But they're getting this lawsuit because people are being...  Apple was using these apps to fuck people over to get information.  I get emails from motherfuckers.  Some of them you can't...  Like Continental, you can't unsubscribe to their emails.  There's no way to stop their emails. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  I'm like, what the fuck?  I want to stop this.  But they get it.  And I don't remember marking anything down to say, send me an email.  I'm getting emails from people I don't want to get emails from.  I always mark down no.  Like if I ever have a website and it says, do you want updates to this or us to say that,  I always fucking uncheck it and go, no.  And then you get them anyway.  Yeah, because as soon as you check no, I think that's the cue right there to send you something.  There's a news story, it was just in the news a couple of days ago. 
[01:48:00]  You might be able to find it.  They're able, the police are using a device to track cell phones even when you're not using them.  You just got them in your pocket.  And they're using it.  And saying, and now they're bringing up the constitutionality of some of this stuff.  And what their argument is, look, it's almost like you've given up any right.  It's public domain, these signals that are going through the air that we can then grab onto.  Because the constitutional rights and the people that keep tabs on this shit have not updated their shit for technology yet. 
[01:48:30]  So it's almost like you're giving up your right to certain privacies just because it's out there.  When you carry your phone around, even off, like my phone right now is throwing out a fucking signal.  You'd have to have it totally powered off.  Powered off.  Exactly.  Then it wouldn't.  Then it wouldn't.  But if it's on and in your pocket, they could track where you are.  And in some cases, when you're using your phone, they could listen to what you're fucking talking about. 
[01:49:00]  We're eventually going to be all, eventually, whether we like it or not, we're going to lose individuality.  We have to a certain extent.  But I mean, we're going to for real lose it.  And we're going to all be on the same.  Once we're all uploaded into computers like Kurzweil was talking about, we are literally all going to know each other's thoughts.  We're all going to, like, for instance, if somebody texts, everything's on film already.  I mean, in 20 years, nothing will happen that isn't filmed.  Nothing.  Everything will be caught by Google Earth.  If it's not 20, then 50 years.  You sound ridiculous.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:49:30]  No, we're heading that way.  I know.  I'm just fucking around.  Norton talking like that.  Way more than 50 years, by the way.  However long it takes.  It's where we're all going to be.  And it's part, it seems like it sucks, and I'm sure it does, but it is a weird part of advancement.  We are all, on a planetary level, going to be on the same thought process and work as a planetary level and then move further.  I'm not saying it's great for individuality, but eventually we're going to lose individuality.  It's going to be seen as a primitive quality.  Your girl, Napolitano, is a motherfucker, right? 
[01:50:00]  What she represents.  I know it's not her.  She's just the figurehead.  Right, right.  But she's just doing the agenda.  But see, when they killed Bin Laden, what they really, they just killed Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda, they don't talk about Al-Qaeda no more.  No, no.  They said, look, it's like killing Hitler, you killed the Nazis, right?  Right.  So it's like, done, moving on to the next thing.  And here's where race gets fucked up.  Here's where our white people and black people being anti-each other is not good because this. 
[01:50:30]  The new terrorists in America now, they're moving on.  It's the Crackers and the Hills.  It's those guys who really are fighting for the Constitution.  They're fighting for freedom.  They're fighting no taxes.  They're fighting for everything that the Constitution stands for.  Yeah.  But the fact that I have been raised as a black guy to believe that those Crackers and the Hills have targets of my face and it's really they're trying to kill me.  When they start coming down on them really so they can take their guns, take their rights, take their freedom, I go, yeah, go get them. 
[01:51:00]  Go get those fucking Crackers.  But really, those are the motherfucking freedom fighters.  Yeah.  And that's where they're moving to.  That's the new agenda.  The fucking Timothy McVeigh guys, that's what they're doing.  Those guys are going to be blowing up buildings and this and that.  But really, half of those fucking people are living just in a shitty way.  Yeah, yeah.  No electricity, no nothing.  Yeah, backwards.  In the backwoods.  Yeah.  Because somebody said something recently that I never thought of. 
[01:51:30]  You buy a house.  If you pay for it, you still pay taxes.  Yeah, yeah.  That's rent.  Don't pay.  That's not your land.  You're paying the fucking government rent.  You paid off your house.  Go ahead.  Don't pay your taxes.  See what happens.  You then don't own your house.  You don't own your house.  They will take your fucking house away.  You're paying rent to the fucking government.  You bought and paid for it.  You're renting from the government now.  That's supposed to be your land.  When you finish paying for your house, it doesn't matter.  You now are a renter again.  There it is.  And you don't pay your rent, they throw you out and take you out. 
[01:52:00]  Let me ask you, and believe me, I don't like the taxes at all.  I understand what you're saying.  But by renting on the land, don't you get certain benefits by being a part of the state?  The benefits you get are police protection, fire protection.  In theory.  In property taxes, sure.  You get a school system for your kids.  You get protection by the military.  You get air protection by the military.  How about that's your federal income tax and things.  And then how about the fact that maybe there's another way around it than taking your fucking 
[01:52:30]  house that you bought and paid for?  Yeah, I agree.  Not everybody is Ant.  Ant gets that.  Yeah, it's just...  But Ant's neighbors...  No.  ...get ostracized.  Yeah.  Ant is Don Colleone of his streets.  Of my fucking street.  He's a...  Ant's a nigger.  He's the nigger of his street.  And I've never denied that in my Jew neighborhood.  Palm trees and fucking parties and pistols.  The Virgin Mary urinating in a statue in the front.  I actually have my next door neighbor. 
[01:53:00]  I guess she came out of the house and she was talking to my landscaper guys.  I guess she's going to be using my landscapers because my lawn is so lush and green.  So then she goes...  She goes...  Because she has an accent.  I don't know.  I think the guy that marries some Russian broad.  Because she's like, you have a lot of parties over there at your house.  I'm like, yeah.  You know.  I go, hey, if you see one over there, come on over.  And she goes, oh, no, that's okay.  I hear them from my window.  Yep.  And I'm the one who called the cops. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's all I'm thinking.  And take the clothes off and get in my pool, bitch.  Yeah, that's all I'm thinking.  Take that yoga.  Hey, we got a computer scientist online.  He says this shit goes way further than you think.  Oh, here we go.  I want to see if this guy has anything.  Eric in Jersey, what do you got, buddy?  Oh, how much do I have?  Let's start with what seems to be your biggest...  Let me walk out.  Your wife's making some noise.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Okay, let's start with email. 
[01:54:00]  Do you have your own website?  What?  Wait, start over.  We're still laughing at the dog joke that you obviously didn't hear.  What?  Okay, you have patriceoneal.com as a website.  Oh, shit.  You set up a catch-all account.  And then when you go to these marketing sites, like you say, Xerox at patriceoneal.com, it goes to a dump bucket, which you can then, you know, filter out.  I'm not going to get eggy on you.  But the point is, if you give your email to Dr. Ted Sheckler, and then later on you get a Viagra ad that says drtedsheckler at patriceoneal.com, not only can you block it, you know who sold you out. 
[01:54:30]  So that's email.  Okay?  Yeah.  So explain that again, because I know what you're saying is important, but we're not technical enough to understand exactly what you mean.  Look at it this way.  You probably, if Patrice O'Neill has a website, he might have one or two accounts.  Can you say Jim Norton next time? 
[01:55:00]  I don't like this Patrice O'Neill's website, because I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Yeah, right?  Hey, wait a minute.  Jim Norton has a website.  Yeah, Jim Norton has a website.  Go ahead.  Eatabullet.com.  Sure.  You got two email accounts your webmaster set up.  Jim at Eatabullet and Info at Eatabullet for like your bookings and shit.  Okay.  Now, you call your web host and say, I want a catch-all email account.  So if you send an email to Donald Duck at Eatabullet, it goes into this one just big garbage bucket of email. 
[01:55:30]  Okay?  Okay.  With me so far, right.  Yes.  Now, later on, you find out that you're getting a ton of spam to Donald Duck at Eatabullet.com.  So you set up a third account for Donald Duck at Eatabullet.com and just have it, you know, fail the delivery so you never get it.  And worse yet, you can bounce messages back like saying, hey, asshole, stop sending me spam.  Anytime someone sends an email to Donald Duck at Eatabullet.com.  Doesn't that sound like a good thing? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, it's a great thing.  He's teaching you how to stop spam.  Oh, I didn't know what it was.  I thought he was telling you some shenanigans that were going on.  And then I'm listening going, wait, that sounds like a convenient thing.  Yeah, we would like that.  This is what you want to do.  So you go tomorrow, you're going to check into the Hilton.  Hi, Mr. Norton, what's your email?  Oh, it's Hilton at Eatabullet.com.  Now, later on, when you start getting aluminum siding ads that are addressed to Hilton.  Okay, all right, okay, okay.  So you're saying, oh, I get it. 
[01:56:30]  He's saying you can find out who's fucking with you.  I don't get my email, by the way.  I don't get my email.  In stores, in fucking hotels, never.  And they always go to you, well, we don't know how to ring this up.  And I'm like, well, I guess I'm not buying it.  I don't have email.  Get a manager.  And believe me, they ring you up.  Yeah, they never give it to them.  They get mad when you don't give your phone number or an email address, motherfucker.  Yeah, you're not getting my number.  I never give them that.  And they're like, we can't ring you up then.  I'm like, get the fuck.  You can still ring me up.  I never give it to them.  They just pressure you.  Never give it to them.  Say, I don't have a cell phone. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  Or I don't have email.  Right.  And they have to ring you up.  And then they get mad.  I'm like, fuck you.  Get your manager.  And I go, you're going to send me fucking mail.  No, we're not.  You're not getting my email.  And I go, I got a tiny little New York City fucking mailbox.  And I don't have room.  And certainly, you know, it turns out they always send you mail.  Fucking lies.  And you know what you do to get them, you know, to give them a little zing is you say,  why don't you send it to nonsense email at eatabullet.com?  How about that?  Nonsense email.  Or you should put a dirty email.  Shitcutfuck at Gmail or whatever. 
[01:57:30]  Right on.  I'm going to open that one.  Shitcutfuck or something like that.  And that's my email.  That's it.  When you're at Best Buy, you just go, yeah, it's shitcutfuck.  Yeah.  Say it real loud.  It's mindyourbeeswaxcunt at gmail.com.  But at this point, our credit cards are matching up our emails and all that, right?  I would.  And the phone company has it.  As soon as you give the credit card, they get all that info anyway.  You think that's a coincidence that when you use your credit card to buy something,  all of a sudden you get 20 emails about the same type of product you just bought? 
[01:58:00]  It is a coincidence.  Wow, what a coincidence.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah, just bought a refrigerator.  I want emails about more refrigerators.  More refrigerators.  How many do I need, motherfucker?  I want my Jeffrey Dahmer.  Do you know what?  I got plenty.  And who gives a fuck if you figure out who's giving you the spam there, Eric?  You can't stop it.  Oh, sure you can.  Because then you do, like Hilton at Eat a Bullet, you set up an account and then just  have it fail.  So anyone that uses that email, nobody will ever see it.  How do you have it fail? 
[01:58:30]  You have the server.  Your webmaster would know how to do it.  Okay.  Webmaster.  But if you go to Hilton at Eat a Bullet and you're sick of getting refrigerator ads, say,  okay, webmaster, set up an account for Hilton at Eat a Bullet dot com, and any email that  comes, just discard it.  And in fact, you can bounce a message back going, hey, asshole, stop letting me email  this.  Eric, someone's asking me if your email is, this guy is boring at Eat a Bullet dot com.  It never fails, man. 
[01:59:00]  All the listeners.  Try and be relevant.  I'm sorry.  Pakistan animation on Twitter.  Very good.  Give us one more, Eric.  Hey, now we're talking about Google.  You were talking about all this stuff, and this is, I really am into some egghead stuff  here, but, and this isn't a joke.  If you Google later on, Ted, T-E-D, Google filter bubbles, you'll get a nine-minute video,  and part of it is boring, I'll admit it.  But the bottom line is, they go through a thing. 
[01:59:30]  One guy's a liberal who's always looking up Obama and this and that, and the other guy's  the Republican, who's only traveling, and they both type in Cairo.  The traveler guy's only going to get plane fares and Expedia.  The liberal guy is going to get all the stuff on the protest.  Wait, is that why every time I Google, like, airlines, I get transcontinental flights?  Schmidt said, it's now impossible to do a Google search that isn't somehow tailored to you if 
[02:00:00]  it's on your computer because of all the cookies.  So your Google search will be different than my Google search, even if we put in the same  fucking word.  Absolutely.  If you do Ted, filter bubbles, because I don't know, it's some egghead consortium, T-E-D,  but there's a good nine-minute speech, and, you know...  It's an egghead consortium!  Yes, I love consortiums, I certainly do!  Food consortium!  Food consortium!  No, it's a marvelous place to buy roasts! 
[02:00:30]  I one time bought a dozen eggs at the food consortium.  There were bubbles all over!  Thank you, sir, for commenting.  I sell eggs in bubbles.  Ted's food consortium!  The eggs always break when I ship them!  Therefore, he's more than one basket!  Yes, you don't want to put them all in one.  You certainly don't, Anthony!  It's an excellent point!  Uh, Ted.  An old Ted.  Ted's an ass. 
[02:01:00]  Anything else, Eric?  My last thing.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Why?  That was just kind of a...  It was like a goodbye answer.  That was like a take it easy.  You know, as a matter of fact, I do have a...  It's not a real...  I was going with the polite goodbye, Eric.  That was a here's your hat.  I should have just went with, thank you, Eric.  And stay out.  There's a can stand right out of my room.  One more about Ted's consortium.  Go ahead, Eric.  Eric?  Oh, no.  We chased him off.  Yes, we also sell tickets for consorts! 
[02:01:30]  If you want to go see a good consort, you can come to the consortium!  Summerfest!  Summerfest!  We go to Orange County.  Andrew!  Hey, how are you?  You know, I was all pissed off, and then Ted came on the line and got me laughing.  Why are you pissed off, Andrew?  It's Friday!  Andy!  Friday!  Friday!  Oh, that's right.  What?  I know, but listen, I'm not happy with Patrice.  Why?  Patrice isn't happy about paying taxes.  Why do you think we all pay taxes for police fire? 
[02:02:00]  Have policemen ever been to my house?  Have they ever been...  No, where do the police guys go?  To the black guys?  Ah, shut up.  And here's the thing.  I'm not upset about taxes.  I'm upset about federal tax.  Not about state tax.  State tax...  Yeah, you don't drop them.  Local taxes.  I'm going to tell you why, asshole.  It's because federal tax is illegal.  Federal tax is robbery.  You pay state tax, and what happens is it's called amortization.  Where Rhode Island, you pay state tax in Rhode Island, they take what is, um, not amortization, 
[02:02:30]  but, um, the size of the state.  Rhode Island takes what you pay to them, and then Rhode Island pays the government to come  do shit.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not supposed to pay the government money.  You're supposed to pay the state, but you know what?  You're a guy, you're a guy who goes, do, do, do it, and you're the fucking guy that  when the shit hits the fan and you're standing around naked, you're looking for help.  But you, I'm telling you now you're getting fucked, so that when five years comes from 
[02:03:00]  now, you're going to go, maybe I should apologize to Patrice, but your whiteness won't let you  do that.  I'm trying to tell you now that it's fucking illegal federal income tax.  It's criminal.  It's slavery.  And you pay it.  And you fucking pay it.  And I pay it too, because I don't want to lose my fucking house.  Exactly.  But it's illegal.  You take it in the ass.  Extortion.  Don't be mad at me.  I'm just saying you take it in the ass.  Patrice, break down your property tax. 
[02:03:30]  I don't see a big part of that going to federal.  Because federal takes it separately.  Because they take it now directly.  Out of my paycheck.  Out of your paycheck.  It's illegal.  No, that's what he's saying.  Look, look, look.  Look, look, look.  You pay your property tax.  The federal government.  Hold on, you dummy.  What he's saying is, the way it was supposed to work was we pay our state taxes, which include  estate tax, your local tax, property tax, things like that.  They're supposed to take care of all the business and then kick some money up to the federal 
[02:04:00]  government to make sure the big highway that comes through, that's federally funded, gets  paid for.  So each state kicks a little more money up to the big boss.  It's like fucking, you know, the mobsters.  The federal government's the fucking Don, and all the states are the soldiers, and we're  the fucking, you know, earners.  The capo regimes!  We don't give the money directly to the fucking boss.  No, he whispers to Paulie, who does this while I do that. 
[02:04:30]  I can't remember the lines.  All I'm saying is there's buffers.  A lot of buffers.  And again, I'm not fucking saying, I stand up to the government.  They'll come.  No, of course.  And I'll be butt naked in the street.  You're powerless to do anything.  But I'm saying, that's how we're living.  We're living a crime.  And it's like, don't argue with me, motherfucker, because I got a big mouth.  But I'm saying, it's robbery.  State tax is fine with me.  That's what you're supposed to do.  But state tax are... 
[02:05:00]  It's like you're playing up like Bruce Springsteen or something.  Oh, you asshole.  You asshole.  I heard him doing a pretty shit.  What a douchebag.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I wish he did that on Twitter.  Yeah, right?  I heard him gear it up for a chip.  I could have just fucking block a room.  I fucking love chip tweets.  There are things that the government does where you just sit there and go like, yeah, it's  wrong.  Everyone knows it's wrong.  But there's nothing you can do about it. 
[02:05:30]  Or else you will lose your shit and go to jail.  There you go.  We're on our way to time travel.  We're going to be okay.  I hope so.  We're on our way to time travel.  How would we stop that if we wanted to?  There's got to be a bloody revolution.  There has to be a...  There's not going to be a...  On a massive scale.  You don't think...  Not these dumb Wall Street guys.  You don't think that they're fucking us enough right now.  Yeah.  I'm going to tell you something.  If you think about this $12 raise, the math.  Yeah.  You figure, I'm staying home Friday and Saturday.  I'm not going to go in no more. 
[02:06:00]  So you figure it's $12.  So it's another $4.  That's $20 a week.  How much is $20 a week on a five-day scale a year?  That $20, man.  $2,000 a year.  I don't make square money.  Mm-hmm.  But I can't imagine that a square person on a fixed income can afford that.  I vividly remember making...  How do they fucking...  No one gives a fuck.  I vividly remember making shit money working for a living.  Right.  And that was a lot of money.  I remember going to the ATM and fucking taking $20 out and being like, oh, looking at my balance. 
[02:06:30]  Like, oh, I just took $20 out.  I'm going to make this last.  I vividly remember that.  Patrice is talking about the $12 is a lot of fucking money.  So $20 is a lot of fucking money.  $5.  It just went up $4 for the cash guys, like we said.  $8 times $5 is $40.  So you only had to take $40 a week out for your tolls if you did that.  Now you have to take $100 out.  Yeah.  Because there's no $12 thing that the ATM's kicking out. 
[02:07:00]  So you got to take $60 more out of your ATM and hopefully, like, save it.  Yeah.  To pay your tolls and save it to pay whatever else.  It's an extra $100, really.  You're spending $100 because what are you going to do?  But if you have EasyPass, $1.50 a time.  So get EasyPass.  Anyone without EasyPass should be forced to swim.  But even the EasyPass fee is ridiculous at this point. 
[02:07:30]  It's disgusting.  Just to cross into Manhattan in a tunnel?  It's terrible.  And there's nothing we can do about that.  Nothing.  And the money was supposed to go to, you know, just the roads and the bridges.  And then they made it where it's like, well, we'll take your toll money.  And then we could shove it off to here.  Some fucking project for some crony guy that this guy did a favor for 10 years ago.  Yeah.  So it doesn't even, you know, it's not even going to fill in the potholes and paint the fucking lines on the street.  Where does it end, though? 
[02:08:00]  So what would be, not that I'm trying to do one, what you think will happen that makes the people say, oh, shit.  And everybody at the same time, Americans all come together and go, nah, nah.  The water's boiling.  You know, let me tell you what.  The majority of the people in this country can go home, they turn on their fucking TV, it comes on, they get cable, they turn on their water, the water runs, they take a shower.  A hundred dollars a month would get cable.  I understand. 
[02:08:30]  I'm not talking about it.  That goes with Patrice's point.  It's getting ridiculous.  Exactly.  But it comes on.  We need a point, I think, where the government fucks up so badly that shit starts failing.  Power companies literally start not being able to pump the power out anymore because the money isn't there to pay the guys that rewind the generators in copper coils or the copper's too expensive to buy.  And it just has to get to the point where the system starts breaking down to where you turn your shit on and all of a sudden go, hey, my shit ain't coming on. 
[02:09:00]  Time to grab the guns.  That would be a revolution.  Yes.  That's what I'm talking about.  But the technology is not just hurting.  Like the fact that we can be caught with technology or it's burning us.  I don't just mean technology.  I was using that.  But I mean everything.  I'm saying it's burning people who are higher up.  It's burning people who are fucking higher up the ladder.  Weiner is a fucking congressman and he lost a gig because of fucking technology.  It's not just burning the lower class people.  Everybody is dealing with it the same way. 
[02:09:30]  Everybody is paying the same price for it.  That's why I'm talking about the second it affects everybody.  Anarchy is different than revolution.  Yeah.  That would be anarchy which would make the army come in and just shoot everybody.  Well, that's also revolution.  You need the support of the army.  And anarchy, I don't know.  Anarchy takes a lot.  Just people on the streets running around.  It is too much shit.  Yeah, that's crazy.  You would need some other person that wouldn't be electable yet would make a good leader that the people and army would be behind.  That's the only way a revolution ever fucking works. 
[02:10:00]  And then when the government that was in place goes to call on the army to quell the revolution,  the army says, fuck you, turns their tanks around, starts shooting at them,  and before you know it, you've got a complete new government.  Now, for that to happen in this country, you've got to go home in the freezing cold, no water, no TV, no food, no nothing.  And then maybe people in this country, these lazy fucking sheep, might actually get up off their ass and go, maybe we should do something. 
[02:10:30]  I think we're being fucked.  It's happening down on Wall Street, Ant.  Don't forget.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That fucking Wall Street thing.  I know that's a big one for you.  Oh, boy.  They're taking over Wall Street.  You bunch of little faggots.  Shut up.  So it's begun.  They're taking over Wall Street on weekends when no one's down there.  But they are, in a way, though.  Yeah, at night when it's closed.  Even though they are just a bunch of little jizz bags, they are, in a way, fighting people who are stealing or saying something about people who are fucking stealing from all of us.  First of all, they don't even know what they're down there for.  Can you explain what this is about for the people that I don't know? 
[02:11:00]  No.  Because they don't even know.  They don't know?  They're doing this thing where a bunch of stink bags go to Wall Street every night and hang out with all of their fucking camera phones out,  waiting for the NYPD to hit them.  That's their top priority, by the way.  Fuck Wall Street.  They don't even know how Wall Street works.  This fucking walk on Wall Street.  Occupy Wall Street.  Whatever hashtag they want to use.  Occupy Wall Street, I think it is.  They don't even know what they're doing down there.  They have no idea. 
[02:11:30]  They saw what happened in Egypt and Syria and all these Middle Eastern countries with change in the government,  and they're like, yeah, we could do it, too.  Where's the blood on your hands?  Where's your buddy Brad's brain splattered all over the side of your fucking head as you pick up a rock and throw it at a tank?  You're a bunch of pussies.  It's the American way of doing it, which is get your phones out, hope some poor NYPD sap gets pissed enough to smack you 
[02:12:00]  so you can end his career and fucking make a YouTube video.  They're a bunch of faggots.  They're not real.  They're phony, wannabe protesters.  Get some blood on your hands, and you might get a little respect from me.  You're a bunch of pussies.  We're all, all going to be part of the same mentality whether we like it or not.  That's where this is going.  That sounds defeated, though, man.  No, it's not.  It's not.  It is defeated.  It's not.  I'm too smart for people to be like me.  It's not, though. 
[02:12:30]  Literally, individuality and this whole thing about we have to fight them, it really is.  We're coming out of being apes.  It's the way we think.  We don't do anything.  Can you picture fucking people that we think are beings that travel to this planet if they exist?  Do you really think they're fucking fighting over property taxes on what planet they're on?  Wouldn't that be hysterical?  You go so far beyond that.  They have interstellar travel, and they're pissed.  I think they probably are.  You think they are?  No.  I think wherever there's some guy in their travel tax, you motherfuckers.  I can't go. 
[02:13:00]  I guarantee there is.  Because we are made up of the same shit that everybody's made up of.  Just because you've got a big head and black eyes and skinny weird arms, the motherfuckers  is arguing over cable.  No, because when you look, from the days people bashed each other over their head and literally  just fucking hid from a lion, if you would have told them, you'd be quietly texting people  and communicating silently, that would have seemed like that will never fucking happen.  They would cave your head in with a rock. 
[02:13:30]  Exactly.  And then eat your phone.  They don't know what it is.  But I think there's a human nature that will stop what you think.  Human nature can be overcome.  It's all chemicals.  It's almost like Jurassic Park.  It's chemicals.  It's almost like Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park.  He's like, this is amazing, but something is not going to happen.  It's just nature is going to do some shit.  It's going to do something.  It does.  Nature can absolutely be controlled.  It can absolutely be fucking manipulated.  Once you're beyond a certain point, then nature is fairly powerless over you. 
[02:14:00]  No.  Once you can.  I absolutely think so.  It's like squeezing fucking clay in your hand.  It's going to come out your fingers.  Yeah.  You can't.  You can't.  It's not all chemical reactions.  It's not chemical.  No.  But it changes.  The chemistry changes.  You fucking.  Yeah.  It's all chemistry.  But maybe these two chemicals ain't mixed yet.  And you don't know what's going to happen.  When you fuck with nature and beings and even humanity or the animal world, plants, whatever  the fuck you fuck with, something happens, adapts, evolves, and changes to shove it back 
[02:14:30]  in your fucking face or to work one or the other, but it's going to change.  And that big lighter that we have in the sky that everybody's always trying to fucking  control, it's the basis of our life.  Yeah.  And I just, look, some people don't believe in God.  The fact that the sun exists and we exist, that's God to me.  And it's very God-like.  It's very where you go, hey, man, look, Irene could have destroyed whatever, you know, or 
[02:15:00]  Katrina did.  We can't control.  Nature will do something to make us stop thinking that we're all fucking mighty.  Nature will always be able to kill people, but even the sun eventually expanding, we're  going to be able to leave this planet and just colonize other places.  You think?  Even, absolutely.  You're just saying that based on what?  How you feel?  No, on the fact that that's what Kaku says and a lot of theoretical physics say.  That's where technology's going.  And there's already, look where we've come in 200 years. 
[02:15:30]  Give me the principles on how we're going to travel.  Okay, from what I know, I'm not a scientist, obviously.  We eventually conquer.  Not principles, theories.  We eventually learn what wormholes are and how to travel through interstellar space and  how to colonize things in space.  And look at how far we've come in 200 years of industrial technology or 250 years.  Multiply that by 500 more years or 1,000 more years where we're going to be technologically.  We've said something in space that just goes.  We know subatomic particles exist. 
[02:16:00]  We fucking, from bashing each other over the head, we are now fucking fighting cancer.  We understand all these things that we didn't understand a couple hundred years ago.  I'm waiting for the shit from the fly.  A couple hundred years ago.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it means.  Yeah, no shit.  To zip us over somewhere.  I don't think it's going to happen.  I don't think it will happen.  Oh, it'll absolutely happen.  I don't think we'll time travel.  We can't wrap our brains around it right now, but it's going to happen.  Of course we will.  Of course we will.  I'm with Jimmy on that.  It's just a matter of fucking passing the speed of light.  I can see us colonizing like Mars somewhere close.  I think we'll be just like the dinosaurs.  I think dinosaurs fucking watch television. 
[02:16:30]  And they lived a lot longer than we did.  Stephen Hawking theorized black holes.  He knew what they were.  They said he was crazy.  He's a fucking idiot.  And now they find evidence of black holes.  It's like they can kind of see this stuff a little bit down the road.  This is 200 years in.  We're fucking 250, 300 years into technology.  So another 200 years is what you think?  It multiplies faster and faster and faster and faster.  I don't think we're going to have Jetson cars, to be honest.  No, I don't either.  I don't think we're going to have Jetson cars.  People aren't responsible.  Look at computers.  They say now that on your phone, basically we have computers that we carry that are more 
[02:17:00]  powerful than what NASA used to send the fucking astronauts to the moon.  True that.  That's 30 years.  More on the toaster.  That's 30 fucking years.  So what do you think we're going to do?  Other than, see, technology, I think, has really, what technology has given us is basically  communication.  Right.  It's not, now, I don't think it's really upped our ability space-wise.  I don't think the shuttle is any more amazing than the fucking Apollo 18.  I don't think we've really developed off this planet. 
[02:17:30]  I think we've developed on it.  I think we've learned how to genetically modify shit and experiment on rats and do certain  things and go, oh, and medicines and everything else.  But I don't think that we are going to do anything that's going to break.  We have a hard time leaving the planet.  We've only been to the moon, supposedly.  A couple of times, yeah.  You're not a supposed guy, are you?  More than once.  We've been there like 10 times.  It never was until I started thinking, why haven't we been there again? 
[02:18:00]  We went there six times.  It seems like it would be easier.  Here's how you travel.  Here's how you travel.  I'll answer your question.  It would be easier now.  You talk about fucking these printers they have that can now print genetic material.  So eventually, once we learn how to navigate wormholes and all that stuff, and now that  they can send neutrinos fucking faster than the speed of light, you start sending, once  they break down your DNA and a computer can actually take you apart and put you together  DNA-wise and print you out on a fucking printer, and once your entire mentality, like Kurzweil  talks about, is on a computer, which is going to happen because it's all just chemical shit. 
[02:18:30]  And they print your soul, too, you think?  Soul is a fucking, is a religious theory.  No, no, no, no.  They print out what makes you do.  Right.  It's all chemicals.  It's all particles.  It's all subatomic particles.  All of it.  And the personality, things we define as personalities, are all chemically explainable somehow.  We can't explain it yet.  But once they figure that out, 500 years from now, you'll be uploaded on a computer.  Like, and I believe, Kurzweil, when you said that. 
[02:19:00]  That's very unspiritual of you.  Of course it is, but it's the truth.  I can't imagine that they're going to print out who you are.  It is weird.  It is weird.  I can't figure, I understand the whole chemistry behind humanity.  Believe me.  But there is that fucking spark that makes you you.  But what is that spark?  I don't know.  That's just it.  It might just be like you say.  A bunch of fucking little glands going squish.  Of course it is.  Squish, squish, squish, squish.  We put a little more of this.  It's like a cake, you know?  You give everyone the same ingredients.  They put a little more, and this one's going to taste a little different. 
[02:19:30]  They'll figure that out eventually.  Exactly.  I totally believe that.  There's got to be something that is completely inexplicable at this point that makes you  you and me make it.  Sure.  Absolutely.  There's subatomic things that go on that we can't explain, but I hate to break, but literally  But you think everything that could be reproduced would spit out an exact Jimmy Norton.  An exact Jimmy Norton.  Emotions can be replicated.  Emotions can be created.  Look, a big boom happens.  Every single living creature goes, ah!  We all look. 
[02:20:00]  We're not that different.  We're all from the same.  It's the same chemical thing that happens to fucking everybody.  Not Clooney in an action movie.  Well, that's different, though.  That shit blows up.  He goes beyond.  That shit blows up behind him, and he still just keeps walking toward the car.  Can I ask Anthony something?  There's a couple things in there.  Why aren't we on the moon just hanging out at this point?  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  Because that's the thing where I did the quote-unquote thing.  I'm not a big, the moon land was fake, but it's strange that we're not hanging out  on the moon.  I would guarantee we went there, but we went, the space program went in a whole other direction. 
[02:20:30]  The funding stopped.  We were going for a more low-orbital launching platform for Mars missions.  That's what the whole space station's up there for.  Changed our whole mission.  So the moon, we've been there, looked at some rocks.  They're still studying shit that we brought back.  There's nothing to get for the moon.  What is with Mars?  People are fascinated with it.  It's the near planet.  I'm thinking we can make a, what I like to call, a shake-and-bake planet out of it.  It's just because it's the next step.  You know, the company, we manufacture those.  But why don't we have a moon station, Ant? 
[02:21:00]  What?  It just isn't probable.  Why would we need a moon station?  It would be just cool.  They are thinking about it as a launching base for a Mars mission.  Right.  But there's no reason to have people living on the moon.  We have a space station.  But that would just be so cool.  Yeah, but they don't do things because it's cool.  And we can monetize that shit.  They don't do stuff because it's cool.  If you could go to the moon and hang out for, you know, a weekend.  What, as tourism?  It seems like that aluminum foil thing would have had trouble getting off the moon. 
[02:21:30]  It seems like we could have took the shuttle and just went there.  Yeah, the shuttle wasn't made for that shit.  And the shuttle, and that's been our only elevation is the shuttle.  All the shuttle was made for is a truck to take shit up to the space station, deliver it, and come back.  That is it.  To make that fucking space station.  And that was the whole mission. 
[02:22:00]  And now that the space station's built, now they want to take materials up.  They want to start building a platform to launch stuff to Mars.  And then when you get enough equipment on Mars, put people there on Mars.  So their eyes can get big when there's no air?  Three-titted fucking chicks and hot little midgets?  For what?  For what? 
[02:22:30]  Because deep, deep down, we know that sun is not going to be there forever.  So we're just trying to figure it out.  Well, it'll be there.  Just life in general is trying to figure it out.  So deep down, I think if you look at some type of...  Well, as far as we're concerned.  And they did touch on this in movies like Total Recall and Aliens.  The...  Sunshine.  The...  Making a planet inhabitable from something that is just uninhabitable.  They say they found a big Earth, too. 
[02:23:00]  They call it...  Super Earth or whatever.  Super Earth.  Super Earth.  Yeah, but they need something close.  See, we need something close at this point.  If there's a way to go to Mars and set up a base on Mars that can be colonized and turn  the carbon dioxide atmosphere into an oxygen atmosphere using, you know, plants breathing  carbon dioxide.  Fuck that.  So you put some plants there and they spit out oxygen.  So, you know, you start slowly in a dome. 
[02:23:30]  Let's just go dome.  Oh, that'll take a long fucking time.  Not a Discovery Channel thing about how plants became over zillions and billions of years.  But a long fucking time.  You're right.  But if we can make them, if we can make them and do what they took millions of years to  do through evolution, if we figure out how to do that on a computer, you could do it  very quickly.  Dude, I think once we start, we...  We can grow hands now.  We can grow skin.  How long did it take you to grow your adult hand?  Now, the way they can do it on a fucking printer, they can do it almost immediately.  I wish Voss was here and do it with a nice hand joke. 
[02:24:00]  Five minutes eternal hand.  How long did it take you to grow that reptilian thing?  I just think the closer we think we get to God, the closer we get to death.  Because it's just like, I think that we are, because we think we're the shit because  we think, because we have an idea of what's good and bad or what's right and wrong.  But it's like, you know, like you go into the animal thing, lions ain't thinking about  that.  They living with us and lions are just going, hey, I'm going to kill this.  Motherfucker. 
[02:24:30]  Like, when I watch, you know, those specials and I see a lion kill a baby something and  you go, that piece of shit lion, I want to just shoot him.  He's not, there's no consequence.  He's not taking that shit.  We think we're something humans because we think we think.  You don't think that big water buffalo looking at the baby one getting all ripped apart  that just gave birth to it is sitting there going, oh man.  It's sadness.  It looks all sad.  Doesn't it look sad?  It's like, oh man.  It's motherly, but the lion is not killing it based on something personal or sport or anything. 
[02:25:00]  We have emotions that make us think that we're elevated some sort of way.  But I think that we are just like dinosaurs.  At some point, something's going to happen and then fund all the barbarian motherfuckers  are going to be riding around.  And then fucking we're going to be the time traveling people that live under the ground.  And then it's going to be another four billion years.  It'll be nothing here. 
[02:25:30]  Then another five billion.  It'll be something here.  Then the sun goes out.  But it'll be something here that can live when the sun is not there.  Right, right.  We are living at God's time.  If you don't believe in God, I'm saying God, but I mean nature, man.  We're here.  Whatever your definition of God is.  I like the idea of what you said with the sun.  And you know what?  You can't even look at the sun.  You can't.  With the naked eye.  If that isn't a fucking spiritual thing, it gives you life.  It gives everything on this planet life. 
[02:26:00]  But don't look at it.  You can't even look at it.  Yeah, put on sunglasses.  Look right at the fucking thing.  Fuck it.  Fuck that big ball of dumb gas.  Fuck it, it's ass.  It's going to eat the earth in four billion years or whatever.  And then we're gone.  I love Jimmy's dick.  The sun's a big hunk of shit.  And it's an average star.  The sun is the five inch dicks of stars.  You think there's shit living on these planets?  Of course.  Yeah.  Because it may not.  It's just something that we don't give a fuck about.  It's the principles of life. 
[02:26:30]  It's the principles of the life.  We've got to get Kevin Smith on the line.  He's been on hold for way too long.  20 minutes.  Hey, Kevin, if you're smoking pot this morning, this has to sound good.  All the mornings that I would be sitting here blazed, listening, going, oh, this is amazing.  I can't.  I've got to drive someplace.  Oh, shit.  I'm sitting here for 20 minutes staring at my weed going just like, smoke it.  Smoke it and join the conversation.  Join in.  Talk about the shake and bake environment. 
[02:27:00]  Shake and bake.  We call it a shake and bake.  We do call this pot talk, man.  We get into pot talk shit.  I love that.  Yeah.  I've dropped the Paul Reiser voice before.  Yeah, yeah.  The Paul Reiser voice.  You know, we manufacture these.  I love that.  Him in fucking...  I think that's one of his best roles ever is him in Aliens.  He, I, it's, when he gets it in the elevator, it's justified.  Nobody feels bad.  Not a person feels bad for him in that one.  When he comes over with the lieutenant, he's like, come on, kiddo, you got to get back on 
[02:27:30]  that horse.  Kiddo.  He calls it kiddo.  He's like, spare me.  He's wonderful, but that movie belongs to Newt.  Yeah, Newt is the best.  Yeah.  Mostly.  They mostly come out at night.  Nobody calls me Rebecca.  You know, the dead kid.  Nobody calls me.  We're really on radio this morning, gentlemen.  For the last 20 minutes, I heard, I was imagining myself sitting in a car somewhere driving to  work, and I was like, that's radio. 
[02:28:00]  That's cool, man.  Kevin, to summarize, where are you at with all that that we just talked about?  My feeling on all of it is that you guys are, again, not stoned enough to jump into  the deeper pool.  And while I think it's important to be vigilant, it's awfully depressing this early in the  morning.  So, may I interject another point of view?  Yeah.  Perhaps simplistic, but it's how I get through a confusing, savage, and indifferent world.  If we're still simply fighting over property taxes, sending texts of our cocks, or watching 
[02:28:30]  the Kardashians, everything's fine.  Then everything's still cool.  That means we're not trying to figure out, like, which one of our friends to eat to stay  alive.  You know, I like how simple you just said.  Yeah, that's a pretty good point.  Bravo.  Yeah, but as other people call those distractions, you know.  I agree.  And it can go from one day...  Life is not worth living, and I think you guys examined it right to the point of human 
[02:29:00]  inexistence.  But thank God, even though we'll be replaced by things billions and billions of years as  they follow, we're going to be imprinted.  That was the one thing I heard in all of that.  Yeah.  Like, yes.  Like, to be able to live on, to have yourself DNA encoded, and if it is, if personality  is, like Jimmy says, simply just chemical, to be able to be imprinted and live beyond  the body, that's what I've been trying to do on Twitter for the last four years. 
[02:29:30]  I've been literally imprinting myself on Twitter so it'll live beyond me.  Yeah, that shit's going to be there for quite a while.  People will be able to look back and say, wow, that was Kevin Smith.  But no, it was his personality.  No one's going to read our shit.  Other than that, this is Kevin Smith.  Yeah.  Yeah, still there.  Kevin watched Red State again, because I was talking about, it does have a re-watchability  factor there, and I was watching it with my chick, and again, just, what great performances 
[02:30:00]  by all these people.  Hands down.  It's acting porn, man.  You like watching people act, and act well.  It's great.  Red State is so for you.  Just those friggin' surprise moments that just make you go, wait a minute, that can't  happen.  As a gun person, do you feel like the guns really played?  Like, since there's no score in the movie?  Yeah.  Those guns just live out there, really big and loud.  So much so that, like, if you watched, if I put score in that movie, people would be 
[02:30:30]  like, oh man, they would never notice the length of that gunfight scene.  Without music, people always go, it's a really long gunfight.  It's a fantastic gun battle, because first of all, there's many different types of weapons,  and it's not like the old movies where they all sound the same.  They got that different sound to them.  And to see, like, a crazy old woman firing off a fucking AK-47, it's hilarious. 
[02:31:00]  And that little chit-chat that she's having with the preacher there, on either side of  the window, as rounds are just flying through, and broken glass, and little pieces of wall,  and they're not even acknowledging them, they're just conversing with each other.  That's a great scene.  I was watching that, again, like I said, the re-watchability is amazing, because then  I'm able to kind of pick up more detail, and that moment is fantastic. 
[02:31:30]  Not even acknowledging that there are hundreds of rounds flying in at them, and they're just  having this pleasant little smiling conversation.  Well, that's conviction, isn't it?  Yeah.  Like, at the end of the day, even though they're in the midst of having a gun battle with the  ATF, they have the conviction of knowing that once they die, particularly that's what the  conversation is about, because she's like, I don't want to live in this world.  Right, yeah.  Once they're dead, that's it.  They're going to a better, simply going to a better place. 
[02:32:00]  And, you know, look, I believe in conviction, you know, just not taking it that far.  Well, that is pretty far, I must say.  Nobody knows.  Yeah.  It's kind of just, you know, it's the idea of faith.  Like, there is no true root for the belief, but they base it on faith alone, and I get  that, you know, I was really Catholic, and I still believe in God and whatnot.  But since nobody has ever gone over to the other side, come back, and explained what  it is, I'd always be suspect of anybody who says, when you die, and it's followed by some 
[02:32:30]  promise of something better than here.  That is the original huckster, man.  That is the original big con.  That's the carny.  It's so easy to tell somebody, I know what happens after, and what happens after is ice  cream and fucking blowjobs for eternity.  You know, it's a way to control here in this world, where it's just like, look, if you  follow these simple rules, ten of them, next life, you get to do whatever you want.  You put your dick in anything you want.  If you're a dude, if you're a chick, they give you a dick, and they let you put your dick 
[02:33:00]  in anything.  Hey, to Anne's point, who did the sound for the movie?  Because the sound was ridiculously good, Kevin.  Oh, my God.  You put me on the spot.  The dude is amazing.  I said, I've got him.  I'm failing at figuring out his name, because this is the first thing I ever worked with  him on.  And on Red State, this was one of the first projects where I literally let everybody do  their jobs.  I used to be a guy that was up in every department, like up in everybody else's grill, trying  to work every department.  And on Red State, I was much more laid back, much more like, how would you do it? 
[02:33:30]  You know, most people would say, that's your job as a director.  They just come to you and ask questions.  So when people would come to me on this flick and, you know, be like, well, what do you  want?  I'd be like, hey, man, how would you do it?  Because when you put it back on them, suddenly they're representing their department, or it's  like, oh, my idea is going to be represented in this movie.  I get to make a little piece of the movie or something like that.  Boom.  They bring their A game.  Yeah, the guy knew what he was doing.  Oh, it's such a big, bad way.  And I sat down with him after the first pass, and I said, look, man, I'm certainly not going to 
[02:34:00]  tell you how to do your job, but there's no score in this movie.  So right now, you are the score.  So this is like, you know, a mixer's dream.  You can go nuts.  Yeah.  Like, crazy nuts.  You know, he figured out ways to, like, just rhythmically kind of throw boilers under one  another, like under when the boys are being chased through the underground by Ralph Garman  with a gun, Caleb.  There's this kind of da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, which kind of like you go, well, that's  score.  But it's not. 
[02:34:30]  And it's literally just the noise of, like, the boiler down there.  Yeah, it sounds like some kind of machine.  And the guns, guns have always been like, they could take you out of a movie if they  don't sound right.  Right.  And I think the first movie that really fucking made guns sound great was Die Hard.  Yeah.  Like, everything before that, if you watch Scarface, especially the original, I think  they might have tried to fix it.  But every gun, no matter what they shot, sounded like the old pew, pew, pew.  Just crap.  And Die Hard, the first time I saw it, when they fired off those guns and it was all bottom 
[02:35:00]  end, like, it fucking shook the theater when you saw it.  That is some shit.  I wonder if it's either going to be Joel Silver or John McTiernan kind of responsible for  that.  Like, of course, there was a sound mixer and a guy that went off and created and recorded  the sound.  Yeah.  Somebody has to pull the trigger and go, like, I hate these gun sounds.  They sound ridiculous.  Can we get better guns?  Yeah.  And it had to be one of those two guys.  And at that point, things changed because up until then, sound wasn't like a marketing 
[02:35:30]  tool, really.  No.  No.  It's like you don't sell a movie going, like, come out and see it because it sounds awesome.  But that was part of Die Hard's whole campaign.  Like, it'll blow you out the back of the theater.  Yeah.  It did.  And when you do, when you stand apart, just even a little bit, and as dopey as, like,  hey, man, our guns sound better than their guns.  People are going to notice.  And back then, particularly, everybody knows.  Then everybody just adapts and it becomes the standard.  Yeah, I see it.  Love that when he shot that. 
[02:36:00]  That big bazooka thing.  Right before he shoots it when the truck is coming into the building in Die Hard.  Oh, my God, dude.  I was, last night I went to, you know, Jimmy Kimmel does this kind of San Gennaro feast  out here.  Yeah.  A miniature version of it.  And so we went, it was the opening night, and Agent Johnson from Die Hard.  Oh, which one?  Robert Davi.  He's given up, like, I guess he doesn't act as much anymore.  He is a singer.  So he was singing.  I was looking up all of a sudden, and I heard Frank Sinatra singing. 
[02:36:30]  I was like, that's crazy, like a dead ringer.  Frank Sinatra.  So much so you thought they were just playing music.  And you look up on stage, and it's Robert Davi.  It's Agent Johnson.  Ah, yeah, it's Johnson.  Johnson, not related.  Yeah.  Actually, we got a fucking, we actually have to go.  All right, no worries.  I got to go, too.  Can I plug what I got to plug?  Yes, absolutely.  Go ahead, man.  It's happening this Sunday in a bunch of theaters where they show the movie, and then we stream  a Q&A into it. 
[02:37:00]  I'm doing it out here in Los Angeles at the New Beverly Theater.  We show the movie, and then afterwards, we do a Q&A where it's the audience in that audience,  the audience in the one in the New Beverly.  And then also we're taking questions from the audiences who attend around the country  who are watching it streamed into their theaters.  In New York, it's at the Lincoln Center, Film Society of Lincoln Center, at the IFC Center.  And in Brooklyn, it's at Indy Screen.  But it's all over the country. 
[02:37:30]  There's about 50 screens, I think.  If you go to coopersdell.com, C-O-O-P-E-R-S-D-E-L-L.com, it's just this Sunday, man.  It's going to be kind of fun.  So you can watch the movie in a theater with killer sound, hear them bullets.  And then right after the movie, they stream a Q&A, and so you sit there and watch Q&A  like you're in the room with me.  Cole, you're taking the future, man.  I love it.  That's your time.  Kevin, thanks so much, man.  And everybody, please, go see it, man.  See you soon, buddy.  Bye, guys.  All right. 
[02:38:00]  Later.  Kevin will be in soon, yeah.  We got Dr. Kaku on the line.  Yeah, Dr. Kaku is on the line.  Sorry to make you wait there, sir.  You're a very busy guy today with this info that came out overnight, huh?  Yeah, very busy.  I was just on Good Morning America this morning.  You braggart.  Hey, did you talk about the satellite falling from the sky?  Yes.  Even Einstein's theory might be wrong.  Oh, we forgot about the satellite.  Where is that going to fall about?  What area of the world?  Well, the question is that it's going to fall between 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock, probably in 
[02:38:30]  the Pacific or probably near Chile.  It's cold, right?  I hope they don't take out the Eddie Vedder guy.  Yeah.  It's terrific.  Hi, Dr. Kaku.  It's Jim Norton.  Right.  Hi.  And I wanted to say, did you, I had long ago theorized, and I remember saying that the  neutrinos would probably travel faster than the speed of light.  How do you, are you surprised to hear that?  Do you think there's a flaw in their math?  Well, I think there's a flaw in their experiment. 
[02:39:00]  However, they say that they've checked it over and over again, that neutrinos fired from  Switzerland to Italy, 450 miles away, arrived 60 billionths of a second faster than expected.  Well, maybe it was just windy or something.  No, I don't think so.  No.  This result has to be looked at very carefully, because Einstein's theory is the bedrock,  the foundation of all of modern science.  This phone call, GPS, atomic bombs, lasers, black holes, expanding universes, all of it 
[02:39:30]  depends on Einstein's theory.  So if Einstein is wrong, oh my gosh.  But isn't it possible that he got, like, that maybe he just scratched the surface, and maybe  there's 300 more layers that he missed just because there's no way we could know it without  computer help?  Well, we think there is a layer below Einstein's theory.  However, that layer is very exotic.  That layer opens up only at the instant of the Big Bang.  And the center of a black hole.  However, in Italy, we don't expect to see violations of Einstein's theory with the neutrino beam. 
[02:40:00]  And that's why a lot of physicists are having a heart attack right now, contemplating the  fact that every single physics textbook, every single experiment has to be revised if this  experiment holds up.  Wow.  Well, maybe, because I used to joke about, like, I bowl like a bunch of neutrinos.  You know, everybody would laugh.  I don't think they would.  I don't think they'd laugh.  Now, why would this, how would this change anything, to tell you the truth?  Life still goes on. 
[02:40:30]  We still wake up in the morning.  I mean...  Thank you!  And what's a split second, really?  I'm still finished in 30 seconds.  Look at the internet.  Look at the communication satellites.  All of it depends on electronics, which in turn depends on relativity theory.  Sure.  So if relativity is totally wrong, this phone conversation is going to go poof.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Einstein was a hack, from what I understand.  Really?  Yeah.  Now, now, but wouldn't that...  It was all poofy.  Just the fact that our GPS does work, and all this does, in fact, work, doesn't that 
[02:41:00]  say that nothing will change, because it would have changed?  That's why I suspect that they made a mistake.  Ah, see?  Yeah, years ago, in the 1960s, there was even more sensational news that the speed of light  rose in daytime and fell at nighttime, according to one physics experiment.  So people said that's a hard thing to believe, that the speed of light could rise and fall  with the day.  But it turns out that the experimental apparatus was outdoors, and was sensitive to temperature  of outdoors, and that's why they were getting the speed of light varying between morning 
[02:41:30]  and night.  Oh, of course, yes.  Dr. Kaku, this is Jim Norton.  Doesn't it strike you as odd, though, that as much as we learned that Einstein would have  pegged the main theory this kind of soon after industrial technology began, doesn't  it seem kind of odd that he would have gotten it right this early in the game for us as  a species who's possibly going to travel in space someday, or live in space? 
[02:42:00]  That's true.  It seemed like the odds would be...  Well, looking at it historically, we realize that Einstein was ahead of his time.  His specialty and relativity beat out his competitors, but the general theory, I think, was maybe  50 years ahead of his time.  Even today, we're shocked at how advanced it is due to the fact that it was proposed in  1915.  Probably because he was...  Is Isaac Newton and...  What's the other dude?  Isaac Newton and...  Bill Tetley?  Bill Tetley and Copernicus.  And Copernicus. 
[02:42:30]  Are they hacks in your profession at this point?  Are they antiquated, or is Isaac Newton still a pretty cool dude?  If you're an Apple salesman.  Well, inside the solar system at low velocities, we still use Newton's laws of motion to shoot  space satellites to Saturn and Jupiter.  We don't use Einstein's theory because we go near the speed of light.  However, lasers, GPS, the internet, all of that use things near the speed of light.  And then Einstein's theory, not Newton's theory, is used in high-tech work.  So, all the high-tech wizardry that we see around us with iPods and iPads and internet 
[02:43:00]  and microwave towers, all of that comes from Einstein's theory.  So, here's a question, Dr. Karku.  Jim was saying something earlier that I disagree with.  That they can recreate you.  Like, do you think one day they'll be able to recreate who you are?  I know you don't have a soul, but it's like...  Not that you don't have a soul, but, you know, you don't believe in God.  Whatever, whatever. 
[02:43:30]  But they can actually create you, and you actually go,  Oh, shit, I'm still here as me, as opposed to a clone that looks like you DNA-wise,  but doesn't have your same essence or whatever you call it.  Well, this theory is actually a subject of debate among physicists.  Because teleportation, we've actually attained it at the atomic level.  And one day, if we teleport Captain Kark, then who is this imposter over there  who claims to be Captain Kark, who sells Priceline, 
[02:44:00]  and has all the personality quirks of Captain Kark?  Well, is it possible...  This is Jim Norton again.  Is it possible that if you learn...  Now, Ray Kurzweil talks about...  And I'm not saying he's the be-all, end-all,  but loading ourselves eventually onto computers,  and your personality and who you are will be on a computer.  Is it possible that if that's how simple it is,  and if everything is just a chemical reaction  that is eventually figured out by computers, 
[02:44:30]  and there is no difference between the uploaded version of me,  essence-wise, and the me that's talking to you right now,  that you could technically live in two places at one time,  just like, say, a 60 billionth of a second apart?  Yeah, and if we have quantum teleportation,  and we're able to create a copy of you, atom for atom,  then in principle, there might be more than one copy of you,  and it's within the laws of physics.  I'm not saying that it's possible...  So if they clone you, they would... 
[02:45:00]  It's theoretically...  Theoretically, there could be a clone of Dr. Kark,  who is also a physicist.  Yeah, you can't rule it out.  There's no law of physics preventing that,  I'll put it that way.  But who also thinks like you, too.  A hundred years from obtaining that kind of capability.  A hundred years.  But what about an exact parallel thinking between the two,  because it's such an accurate representation of the other, 
[02:45:30]  that whatever chemical reaction makes thought,  and your thought process, and your own soul,  can there be exact duplicate thinking and reasoning?  Well, that's beyond our capability,  and I think maybe for a hundred years,  that's going to be beyond our capability.  A hundred years.  That's nothing.  A little more than that.  I have a tape recorder,  and a tape recorder sounds like you.  The tape recorder has all the mannerisms of you.  It does not mean it is you.  Right.  And it's going to take many, many decades  before we can get a tape recorder 
[02:46:00]  to mimic your personality,  to be spontaneous,  to be hilarious.  Right.  But again,  he talked to you a hundred years ago,  a hundred years from now maybe.  You're not saying it's an impossibility.  You're saying we're probably a hundred years out  from that type of thing,  with technology advancing as quickly as it is.  So once that's accomplished,  then that is immortality.  Yes.  Well, yeah,  but who wants to live inside a tape recorder?  No, no, no, no, no.  You won't be in a tape recorder. 
[02:46:30]  The cloning,  the actual making of another you.  Yeah, it's conceivable.  You can't rule it out.  So then that will be now,  you will now be...  Immortal.  Immortal.  Because your body is replaceable.  Would you have all the memories  that you had had in your first body  into that second body  so you can continue being...  Oh, no.  Just program it into your new body.  It's all chemical stuff.  We just don't know how it works yet.  But once a computer,  once we figure out chemically  what is a memory,  what is that visual image  that becomes a memory in your mind, 
[02:47:00]  how does your mind relate something  and remember it and see it...  Sure, that could be recreated.  Yeah, it'd be fucking easy.  It's like carditos.  This is the thing.  The Big Bang Theory...  Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Cockroach.  What's that, Dr. Cockroach?  If you could replace  every neuron in your brain  with a transistor  and have a duplicate brain  made out of transistors  with exactly the same architecture  as your own brain,  then you would, in principle,  have the same responses  that is same personality.  Right.  Have the same wishes, goals, instincts.  This is Dr. Norton.  It fires the same. 
[02:47:30]  This is Jim Norton again.  How are you?  Hi.  I'm just curious to the...  This is an odd thing.  Now, you think that our universe  may have started  coming out of the...  kind of the ass end of a black hole.  Is that correct?  Is that a possibility?  There is a possibility  that maybe we are a white hole  that came out of a white hole.  Oh, we should tell them  about the video I saw.  Doesn't it sound odd, though,  that we just...  Doesn't the whole thing  we come from, like,  this little atom seem a little...  Is it possible  that we kind of were  a condensed planet or something  from another universe?  And you know how it gets down 
[02:48:00]  to singularity  and it kind of kicked us out  the ass end of a black hole?  But we're just a very...  A much smaller version  of something  that was, say,  a foot long.  Like the super...  You know what...  Things that aren't explained...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, doctor.  We could be a white hole  instead of absorbing...  A white hole,  which basically just shows up on time  as opposed to a black hole.  But can I ask this?  Can I ask this?  We fucking...  Oh, guys.  We know...  We know... 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  ...that the heart beats  and what the heart does  and what the...  But we don't know how it...  We don't know what the motor is.  There's no real beginning to the heart  or even this Big Bang Theory.  To me,  it's like there was a before  the Big Bang Theory.  There was a something  before the Big Bang.  Like the idea of nothingness  doesn't register with me.  Yeah, we can't...  We can't wrap our minds around nothing.  We're not a star with nothingness.  But then nothingness is something.  Right, right. 
[02:49:00]  What's that, Dr. Kaku?  You think what happened  before the Big Bang  was that there was a multiverse.  If our universe is a soap bubble  that's expanding,  that there could be  other soap bubbles out there  in a multiverse  which looks like a bubble bath.  And these bubbles fission  creating baby bubbles  with an expand  giving you the Big Bang Theory.  And the one's in...  Take me away or something.  Exactly, Chip.  Big Bangs could be happening  all the time.  But what's in between...  What's in between these...  What's that?  Beyond the bubble... 
[02:49:30]  Hyperspace?  So it's basically space  that is...  What is the Big Bang  expanding into?  If the bubble is three-dimensional  then what it's expanding into  is four, five, six dimensions.  Oh, shit.  We think up to 11 dimensions.  So we think that  in 11 dimensions  that is a true arena  of the multiverse.  Wow.  And do you guarantee...  Do you guarantee that  that the idea of aliens  that they're always smarter than us?  Could we possibly be  the highest developed creature  in the universe? 
[02:50:00]  I find it very unlikely  given the fact  that a Kepler satellite  has now surveyed the galaxy.  One out of every 200 stars  apparently has an Earth-like planet  going around it.  Hmm.  And so I think that  we cannot calculate  how many planets  there are in the galaxy  that are Earth-like.  It's in the billions.  And that's only our galaxy.  But I'm saying,  do you think we could be  the smartest creature  in the whole universe?  He's saying no.  That's almost impossible.  That's very unlikely.  Hmm. 
[02:50:30]  In which case,  other civilizations  could be thousands,  millions of years  ahead of us  because the universe  is 13.7 billion years old.  So what's a million years  out of 13.7 billion years?  Now, okay,  that's the question.  13.7 billion years.  What was the year  before that?  Do you understand?  Like,  that's what confuses me  that my mind  can't get my head around  is the nothingness  before the existence  of the universe.  Right.  What's that?  What do you think it was?  Our universe  was probably connected  by an umbilical cord 
[02:51:00]  to a parent universe.  There was another universe  that existed  before our universe.  Jesus,  that's a lot of time.  So 13.7.  We can peel off  baby soap bubbles.  Now,  you're saying 13.7  and they say  that's kind of a give or take  like a 40-year ratio?  I go with the soap bubble.  I'm going with the soap bubble.  1%.  We know the age  of the universe  to within 1% accuracy.  See,  she celebrates  its birthday  as something  getting a big hat.  Oh, Chip.  Dr. Kakukou,  is it possible  that we're already  connected to a higher  life form?  Where? 
[02:51:30]  I mean,  where would this higher  life form be?  Exactly.  I don't know  how the connection  would be,  but from somewhere else  where they're way more  advanced than us  and we're already  connected to them  in some way,  but we just don't know that.  I don't know.  I'm not a physicist.  They gave us  the ingredients,  the soap,  and then left.  Yes.  Dr. Kakukou.  Somehow there's already  a connection.  We just don't,  we're not smart enough  on our level  to even understand  that yet.  Well,  some physicists  have said  that maybe  the aliens  are already here,  perhaps on the moon,  just like in the movie  2001. 
[02:52:00]  They would send  robots to explore  the moons  of the universe  because moons  are quite stable  and they would  essentially have  listening posts.  And so maybe  on our moon  there is evidence  of a previous visitation.  So we are about  a hundred years  away from having  the technology  to find such a  project.  It's like a contract  that says two weeks.  Is it possible,  Dr. Kakukou,  hi,  this is Paul Hoggis,  is it possible  that when you get  like a really  young universe  that like an  older universe 
[02:52:30]  could go inside  of it?  Oh,  well,  yeah,  in the sense  that if our universe  collapses  into a big crunch,  then maybe it'll  disappear into  another universe.  However,  the latest  experimental data  indicates that  we're going to  have a big freeze  rather than  a big freeze.  A Patrice?  A big freeze.  Wow.  Put your mittens on.  That's crazy.  Hey,  can we ask you  about the 3D printers?  We just learned  about them a little bit  in the last week or so. 
[02:53:00]  Where's this technology  going?  Well,  ultimately,  maybe within  a hundred years.  Another hundred years?  You can't say  a hundred years  for everything.  I think he's  saying a hundred years  because he's  going to be dead  and he don't  give a shit.  So a hundred  is the same  as a million.  It don't give a shit.  It sounds like  something physical.  They just say  a hundred years.  The goal of the 3D printer  is to get a replicator  because of Star Trek.  Right.  That's the goal.  In fact,  I had my face  replicated in 3D  by such a device  for the Science Channel. 
[02:53:30]  Sounds frightening.  Yeah,  did you see it  and go,  hi,  I'm me.  Oh,  hi.  Yeah,  that's scary.  It took about  20 minutes  to create  a carbon copy  of my face  in three dimensions  made out of plastic  using a 3D printer.  They scanned my face  with a laser beam  and then using plastic  created a 3D image  of my face.  George Lucas  did that shit.  Wow.  It was amazing.  In the future,  instead of using plastic,  we'll use flesh.  About a hundred years.  We can already  put cells 
[02:54:00]  inside a laser printer,  a dot matrix printer,  and shoot out cells  instead of ink  and create heart tissue  this way.  That's crazy.  How long do you think  it'll take  to get that technology  where we can actually  maybe use it?  Well,  the technology  exists already  by which we can  create heart tissue.  That's already been done  at Wake Forest University  in North Carolina.  So how long  until we really  held a school to go?  About a hundred years?  We're a replicator  like Star Trek. 
[02:54:30]  Do you think  Dr. Kaku  is possible?  I've often  theorized this  that once we learn  how to bend  space-time  and things of that nature  and go through  wormholes,  is it possible  once you can upload  somebody on a computer  you could just  zap them there  and print them out?  I think I asked you that,  but it's not  physically impossible  that you could just  a computer could see  exactly...  In a hundred years,  motherfucker,  he said that!  But then we could  just zap a person  and just go...  Who's talking about it?  Jim Norton,  Dr. Kaku.  I have yet to see 
[02:55:00]  a law of physics  that prevents  that capability.  Yeah.  Yeah, see,  you're a physics guy,  so unless there's  a law of physics  that says something  can't be done,  you will assume  that in time  it can be done.  It can be done.  And that time  would be probably  about a hundred years.  And time travel  is definitely  not possible, right?  Yes.  No, there's a theory  of time travel  that's being looked  at very seriously.  To go in the past  or go into the future.  I can't imagine  you can't go in the past. 
[02:55:30]  That has to be impossible.  There are hundreds  of solutions  of Einstein's equations  which take you  to the past.  And if you have  something called  negative energy,  then you can actually  hold the gateway open.  So basically,  Patrice is a  time-traveling vessel.  Because he said  that you have  negative energy.  Oh, you fucking douche.  That was a good one.  Now, here's my last question. 
[02:56:00]  Absolutely my last question.  Yeah, we gotta get going.  If, say, you're  the Tupac of physics,  who's the biggie of physics?  Who's either your counterpart  that you respect a lot  or your counterpart  that you go,  this guy is just ridiculous?  Bill Tetley.  Oh, like,  who's the big kahuna  out there?  Yeah.  In your estimation,  or, you know,  if you're the big kahuna,  say you,  but who's the guy  that I should Google  to, you know,  either respect or... 
[02:56:30]  The guy you look up to,  like a Dr. Chipperson or...  In string theory,  which is, you know,  what I do for a living,  one of the great engines  of string theory  that generates  a lot of ideas  is a guy named  Ed Witten  at the Institute  for Advanced Study  at Princeton  where Einstein worked.  So, he's a guy  that likes to keep  a low profile,  but he's basically  one of the big engines  that drives  the whole theory forward.  Hmm.  Is string theory  looking like it's real,  or is it...  Some people say 
[02:57:00]  it's a bunch of bunk,  pardon my French.  No, we're in the process  of testing the periphery  of it with  the Large Hadron Collider.  Next year,  it'll be zapped up  the full power  and we'll be able  to hopefully  create sparticles.  Sparticles are  higher vibrations  of the string.  So, the people  who say that you cannot  test string theory  simply don't know  anything about  string theory.  If you see a string,  like let's just say  there's string theory,  is it possible  to cut one of those  strings in half?  Yeah, we think  that ordinary atoms  are made out of 
[02:57:30]  vibrating strings.  Every time you split  an atom,  you're splitting a string.  So, isn't a vibrating  string made up  of something smaller?  If you can cut it  in half,  isn't there something  that makes up  a vibrating string  which is smaller?  Yeah, but every time  you cut a string,  you get another string.  So, the unit of strings  is the smallest  you can get.  So, if you cut  Jim Norton in half,  will both of those  halves live  like a mollusk?  Barely.  Like a jellyfish.  Like some kind of  jellyfish.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Dr. Kaku,  what are we promoting 
[02:58:00]  today, sir?  The universe.  Well, I've just  gone off my book tour,  Physics of the Future,  hit number six  on the New York  Times bestseller list.  Oh, congratulations.  Happy ending  to number four.  A lot of people  are curious  about the future  and I've interviewed  over 300  of the world's  top scientists  for that book.  Yeah.  So, a lot of people  want to know  what's in the laboratory,  what's being done  that will change  their lives.  Who's your favorite  comedian?  Favorite comedian?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think  I have one.  Yeah, of course not. 
[02:58:30]  Michael Richards.  The only laugh  that he does  is when it's  an uncomfortable  moment.  He kind of just goes...  You don't watch  comedians there,  Dr. Kaku?  We have a few  on the show.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Maybe the people  on Oppie and Anthony.  Yes.  Have you heard of...  Oppie.  I love him.  Have you heard  of Jim Norton?  Jim Norton?  Oh, well,  I have now.  There you go.  All right.  Hey, that's nice.  Well, next time,  maybe Sam...  Maybe next time  he'll recognize you.  You've met a few times. 
[02:59:00]  Are you laughing  at Stephen Hawking?  When y'all meet up,  you're just going  to look at you, stupid.  I can't hear.  What was the question?  It was a Stephen Hawking thing.  You just want to  smack his dumb straw  in his mouth?  Yeah, you feel sorry  for him?  No.  He's lost control  over everything  except his blinking muscles  and his facial muscles.  Eventually, I think,  we may actually hook  an electrode  to his brain directly  and hook his brain  to a computer. 
[02:59:30]  This has been suggested  seriously.  It's just an experiment.  Oh, he's done.  He's like done  in terms of...  No, he's still  blinking his shit out.  But I'm saying he's...  Oh, he's still...  He's still blinking his shit out.  He's still thinking  as smart as he ever thought.  His body just went kablooey.  His brain is very active  except that he has  lost control  over his muscles.  Yeah, he can't pop lock.  With a stroke victim,  we've already done that.  We've always hooked up  the brain of a stroke victim  directly to a laptop.  They can now surf the web...  That's great.  Half the laptop works. 
[03:00:00]  They can do emails,  write emails,  answer emails.  They can do anything  you can do on a computer  and they're totally paralyzed.  You can send an email  to like ethyl  at rrrr.com.  Yes.  I think you could.  That's fucked up  what he just said.  I think Stephen Hawking's  brain is perfectly normal.  His brain is...  Sure.  But he has no more  theories anymore.  Like, he can't...  Because you can't...  How do you blink out of theories?  He's blinking shit stuff.  No, he has theories,  but there's no more  that's going to be...  What if he's trying  to blink out a number  like 3,218,000 
[03:00:30]  but he has to start over?  It's going to take a while.  It's a tremendous problem  that he has.  He can't use his hands  to use a pencil  to catch...  Jimmy can't either  when he acts.  It's terrible.  Shit.  Without use of your hands, man.  It's like...  Oof.  Well, Dr. Kaku,  thank you so much.  Yes.  Always a pleasure, sir.  Always a pleasure.  Always very insightful.  Thank you so much, sir.  Yes.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  We'll talk soon.  Dr. Kaku.  Okay.  Ah!  I was writing notes  to Patrice. 
[03:01:00]  Jim has met Dr. Kaku.  They live in the same building.  They've been in the same elevator  and he still...  Jimmy says hello to him  all the time.  I don't mind.  I'll see him  and I'll see him again  and he just gets frightened  when you're like,  hey, how are you?  He goes, ah!  He's such a...  He's a skittish.  It's weird to be...  I can't imagine being  so physically unimpressive  that he just don't remember you ever.  He does not remember you.  And I know Norton...  That side of his brain  just doesn't work.  Norton wants to believe  that he does it with everybody,  but he don't.  But does he not remember you either? 
[03:01:30]  He doesn't remember.  I don't think he remembers  ever being on the show.  You at least are Opie.  No, I like the idea, certainly,  but I live right next to Jimmy  and I see him all the time  and I say, hey,  Opie from Opie and Anthony  and he does this  clueless, weird thing  and runs away.  He's not wrong.  No, no, no.  He's not wrong.  I like your theory, Patrice.  He's not wrong.  I would like to think  that's what's going on.  I have met the same people  40 times  who always put their hand out  and introduce themselves.  I really do not leave  a lasting impression.  You know what?  The way I would be flattered, 
[03:02:00]  he calls you Opie  and that's like Oppenheimer  who was the father  of the atomic bomb there.  That's probably why  he thinks Opie  instead of Opie.  He has no clue.  Opie would be silly.  He has no clue.  Norton just is not,  you know.  He said,  this is Jim Norton.  He said,  this is Jim Norton  four times in the same conversation  and there was no recognition.  On my tombstone,  it's just going to say,  here lies Jim Norton.  Remarkably forgettable. 
[03:02:30]  Aw.  Yeah,  because he keeps saying Jim Norton  and he's talking about  metaphysics and  metaphysics and everything.  I met a physics too.  I was like,  how you doing?  It said,  hi, Chip.  Oh, you didn't.  No, it's just a living bowl of grits  with no butter on it.  No salt, nothing.  Yeah, you're grits.  Why don't you kiss my grits?  Fucking cuckoo  just doesn't pay me.  We got a break.  He's so poor,  he can't pay attention.  We have to at this point.  Oh, shit, man.  It's not even a choice.  I'll just keep schooling you.  Big Mama Prods is in the studio. 
[03:03:00]  That's Patrice O'Neal,  Stress Factory,  this weekend,  tonight and Saturday,  or tomorrow, obviously.  Tonight and tomorrow.  7-3-2-5-4-5-ha-ha.  These tickets should sell out, right?  So they should call ahead.  Yeah.  They should start fucking calling, man.  Yeah, or call hands  if you're going to call ahead.  Patrice O'Neal at the Stress Factory  tonight and tomorrow.  When we get back.  Vinny said hi, by the way.  Well, fuck Vinny  and his stupid chicken wings.  Fuck him, fuck him.  He's got good food there, too, actually.  He runs a nice joint.  Chris Cornell next.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku, 
[03:03:30]  and you're listening to  Oppie and Anthony.  Oppie and Anthony.  Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku,  and you're listening to  Oppie and...  No.  Oppie?  Oppie.  Oppie, all right.  Okay, Oppie, Ryan.  Oppie, right.  We physicists always pronounce it Oppie  because of a famous physicist,  Oppenheimer.  Okay, Oppie.  Ah, see, we didn't know that.  Yeah, he built the atomic bomb.  Yeah.  Hey, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  You're listening to  Oppie and Anthony.  The Oppie and Anthony show 
[03:04:00]  on Sirius XM.  The virus.  Three, two, one.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  This is Dr. Michio Kaku.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  This is, this is, this is Dr. Michio Kaku.  Kaku, Kaku, Kaku.  Three, Kaku, Kaku, Kaku, Kaku, Kaku.  2  Kaku  Kaku  Michio Kaku  1  1  1  1  1  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The Virus 
[03:04:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show  Ah yes, we're waiting for Chris Cornell to enter the studio.  Traffic, right?  You stuck in traffic?  Is he?  I'm really psyched that he's doing some solo stuff.  You're on.  I made my face change.  Oh, okay, my headphones were off.  It was like the old dream I have.  Does Dr. Kaku drive you nuts like he drives me nuts?  No, not at all.  Just that socially he's just not there. 
[03:05:00]  I don't mind because it's not like he's thinking of nothing.  What he's thinking of is so much more interesting on a real level than what we're thinking of.  Like you said, he's looking at pictures to figure out where time started,  and we want to discuss maybe a Seinfeld episode with the guy.  But he understands that.  We could talk about it in theory, like dumbbells.  But when he thinks about the universe being on a bubble,  and Patrice's mind can't wrap around that, his mind can.  Right.  And he can think about different dimensions.  And I think, wow, that's cool.  But he really knows what that means. 
[03:05:30]  What does he hear when he's listening to us talk back to him?  The sound you hear when your dog farts?  You think?  Yeah, of course.  I think it's like cicadas.  Yeah.  He hears cicadas.  He's being polite.  Yeah.  But I mean, that guy Ed that he talked to, who he likes in Princeton,  when he talks to him, he doesn't talk about, like a bubble bath or cookie people.  No, it's very, yeah.  He calls him, and it's interesting to him to talk to Ed.  You think they just laugh over?  They have a good chuckle?  I don't know what makes them laugh. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, I ate, I had a sandwich today.  It tasted like it came through the collider.  They probably cracked up.  Ah, collider jokes.  How could that happen, right?  Patrice O'Neal's here, Stress Factory, tonight and tomorrow.  We're going to sell that shit out, right?  Right, people?  Go.  Stressfactory.com or 732-545.  Ha ha.  And Patrice also will not be appearing in Tampa with me the 29th through October 1st.  Why not?  At the improv.  Why wouldn't he?  Because he has other gigs.  Ah.  That would be cool.  And I'm coming to Pittsburgh October 20th through the 22nd as well. 
[03:06:30]  Cool.  So those are my two dates.  I'm trying to book one in Jersey.  It's all about me booking stuff.  Does Chris Cornell realize we want to start our weekends?  He's probably stuck in bumper to bumper.  He's on his way up.  Oh, he's on his way up?  Yeah.  Hey, guys, I'm going to take off.  Why don't you stay?  What's wrong with you?  Should I stay?  Yeah, why don't you stay?  We just wanted to sit in here because you're being filmed.  You just want us to say, please stay?  No.  We'd like you to stay.  I thought that Chris Cornell would sit here.  You're welcome to stay.  And I wouldn't have much to add.  No, no, no.  Yeah, you would.  You would have your point with you.  No, you can stay.  Believe me, you'll come. 
[03:07:00]  I know Black Hole's son.  You'll tell him that.  You'll be able to come up with shit.  He'll like that.  He's kind of a regular cool guy.  Okay, fair enough.  Chris Cornell is really cool.  You know me, I don't like to cause trouble.  Oh, please.  Oh, are you feeling like you just might?  Is that what's going on here?  No, no, no.  You feeling itchy?  You feeling itchy?  I'm trying to become, I know that black anger is good for the soul, but black happiness.  Happiness is good for the pockets.  What's under Sway's hat?  What's under Sway's hat?  Does he ever take that off?  No.  A lot of hair, obviously.  Is that a lot of dreads on there? 
[03:07:30]  Dandruff and positivity.  Why doesn't Sway come in and say hi yet?  Because he doesn't like you.  He broadcast next door.  I don't know.  Sway is pro-black.  Is he, like, militant?  No, no, no.  Sway is cool.  Sway's cool.  He just, you know.  Sway's a good guy.  Sway!  He's talking to somebody.  Probably about making love.  What's up, Sway?  He doesn't want to say hi.  Yeah, he has no interest.  Come in and say hi.  Sway, what's up, man? 
[03:08:00]  We just want to say hi to our neighbors.  I've never really got to a feel so happy.  Let's be honest, Sway.  Tell the white people.  You're not interested.  I'm here, but it's just...  Patrice is like, you're not interested.  We live right across the street.  No, no, you know, um...  There's a train track in between your studio and ours.  I'm all right.  I've never...  Just be honest, Sway.  Just be honest.  You can be honest.  Because they ask a white question like,  hey, what's under the hat?  I'm just saying.  What's under white hats? 
[03:08:30]  Hair.  Fucking hair.  What's under the hat?  Nah, because I know them, so they just know.  Patrice doesn't think you like us.  He gets a feeling.  He only says that because he thinks black people just don't like us.  Yeah.  Which is not true.  As a black person, be honest, Sway.  When you look at him, immediately you can't like him.  Pointing at you, Norm.  I didn't have any desire to meet him.  I would admit that.  There you go.  That's why he hasn't committed him.  You work across...  It's just like me and my Chinese neighbors.  But once you get to know me, I'm a lot of fun. 
[03:09:00]  You're all right, man.  Take a seat over there and shit, I guess.  We're on the end.  We never really met.  No, we didn't.  Yeah, so right.  You know Sway?  You're seeing Sway from MTV.  What's up, man?  Hell yeah.  You guys.  Chris Cornell.  That dude looks scary, man.  You know.  That's Chris Cornell.  That dude.  That's Chris Cornell.  I've got to go back to work.  All right, Sway.  Oh, damn.  We just wanted to meet Sway.  We wanted to finally just break the ice and say hi.  Absolutely.  We'll never talk again, but at least we said hi.  But at least we could do that with a smile, kind of nod. 
[03:09:30]  Hey, you're in the hallway.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You guys are legends to me, man.  I've been following you for a long time.  We've seen you on MTV for many, many years now.  Absolutely.  Now I'm going to say four or five.  I know.  You're right there.  We're family.  Let's do something for the photo.  We'll do something together.  You guys come over there.  I'll come over here.  Yeah, yeah.  We used to go over there.  We used to go over there.  Y'all got beat up?  What happened?  No, it's fine.  It's totally fine.  Get racist, Sway.  No.  We're not racist.  We're not racist at all.  Excuse me.  You interrupted.  Go ahead.  Yeah, of course. 
[03:10:00]  Of course he interrupted.  All right, Sway.  Thank you.  Take it easy, Sway.  Wow.  Chris Cornell.  Taking up Chris Cornell's time.  I'm sorry, Chris.  In the studio now.  Goddamn.  Chris, I got to start.  Earlier in the show, we played the keeper before you got here.  That's excellent.  And fucking love the song.  Thank you.  Me and Ann always talk about when you slow it down, you have just the most amazing voice.  Thank you.  And it's good to hear that.  Yeah, there's two things there.  You could either get the holy shit, Chris Cornell really fucking getting the range and screaming 
[03:10:30]  and sounding amazing.  But you could take it down and do a real soft song that is just...  Really shows off your voice, too, man.  Touching.  Quite touching.  I think there's a compliment in there somewhere.  Somewhere, yeah.  It was a little weird, right?  It's confusion in there, too.  I know.  It's not your fault.  I don't know what I'm saying.  It's something that I have done.  I saw Soundgarden.  I've created this in my life.  Nobody really knows.  It doesn't make a lot of sense.  But I don't know.  I just like music.  So whatever I like, I want to kind of go do sometimes. 
[03:11:00]  Do you like Johnny Cash's cover?  I mean, I love his cover of Rusty Caged.  When you first heard that, did you like that?  Yeah, I did.  You did.  It baffled me a little, the concept.  But I learned a lot, which was you can take any song and kind of do whatever you want with it.  And if it's a good song, it'll work out.  And he just took Rusty Caged, a Soundgarden song, which was this crazy against the wall riff.  And then they just rearranged it.  And then he sang Rusty Caged over it. 
[03:11:30]  It was Johnny Cash.  It was great.  And then you're like, yeah.  He went dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum.  It's like, what?  Which is really a stretch for Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  That whole thing.  He did his Johnny Cash thing.  But he turned me on to the song from Soundgarden.  Like, I heard Johnny Cash's first.  Oh, really?  And then he got into Soundgarden.  Really?  Yes.  That's an odd thing.  I'm very anal about rock.  I listen to Sabbath and Kiss and I feel disloyal if I like anything else.  I'm a complete creep.  He's obsessed with Sabbath.  Yeah, I'm stuck in the 70s.  But, you know, I got messages from people after Johnny Cash did Rusty Cage telling me 
[03:12:00]  how great the lyrics were.  And they never said that when they heard my version.  It was Johnny Cash sort of, I think, you listen to him more.  And he sold those words more than I did somehow.  I wonder why that is.  I don't know.  But, you know, I met him one time and it was terrifying.  It was the only time I've really been scared to talk to another human being.  And when he spoke, like, the ground vibrated around you a little bit because the voice was  really low and he was just a super intense guy. 
[03:12:30]  But some people have that ability when they sing.  You just stop and pay attention to what you're saying.  How is it out with Soundgarden?  Everything fine?  Great.  Yeah.  We had a blast.  I went to the Jersey show.  Fucking amazing.  Thank you.  It's fun.  It's really fun.  Really loud still, man.  Yeah.  Really loud still.  Holy shit.  That's good, though.  Because sometimes you see bands when they get back together again and it's like, fuck, 
[03:13:00]  man.  You know, I remembered this when it was loud.  Oh, they like to keep it loud.  And now I can talk to the person next to me.  No, it's not like that.  Yeah.  No.  You're not having conversations when you go to a Soundgarden show.  That would be weird almost, I think, if you could hear anybody speak.  Yeah.  That happens sometimes.  It sucked.  I went to see, like, years ago, I went to see Blue Oyster Cult when they got back together.  And I was able to lean over to my friend and go, yeah, this is Emmy 262.  I'm glad they're doing this one.  And you're like, you never would have, your nose would have bled. 
[03:13:30]  Turned that shit up, right?  Yeah, it was crazy.  That's what I like, though.  Still, yeah, Soundgarden, you're going to hear the volume.  The guys are all into it and shit, right?  Yeah.  And we're all having a great time.  We tried to actually, you know, in the interest of not murdering our ears and getting tinnitus,  and we tried to back off the volume a little bit this time.  We were talking, you know, when we were rehearsing a lower volume, try that out.  And it just, everybody sort of reaches and turns up slowly at different times across the stage.  And then it starts playing louder. 
[03:14:00]  And then at some point, this is the way it always was.  The first person you usually see is the guitarist to go over and go like, do, do, do.  Just touch to get his lead up a little bit.  And then the bass player is like, well, Fatimenda's gone.  Let me go up here.  And then the drummer's fucking just pounded and tried to play a little louder.  And Chris is screaming.  Yeah, and after 10 a little bit, you know, it's insane.  Before you know it, yeah.  Are you ear shot?  No, my ears are pretty good.  But after some of these shows in the summer, I definitely was hearing bells. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, you don't do the plugs?  No.  It's all his hair.  I do it sometimes, but I don't, no.  Okay.  No.  Yeah.  You don't hear that whoosh.  Yeah, I hear that.  That whistling sound, man.  Or sometimes just a eeeeeee in the middle of the night wakes me up.  But it goes away.  Do you have to, in a while it does, do you have to go to sleep with like something on?  Like a TV or?  No.  Thank God.  I hope that doesn't happen.  I have friends that do that.  Yeah, like you just, because you.  You have to have a fan or something.  Yeah, something.  Someone in the room telling you you rule. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, that's like what an idiot I am.  That was all right, though, man.  Oh, that stunk.  No, it was kind of cute.  What's the solo tour all about?  What are we going to hear?  Um, I don't know.  I don't, I usually don't do set lists for that.  Oh, you just.  But I do like whatever I want from any period.  You just kind of make it up as you go?  Yeah.  You never get somebody yelling, you know, do Stonehenge.  Yeah, I do.  If you yell it, I'll probably try it.  Give it a whirl.  That's sort of part of what's fun about it.  Because with a band, especially a loud band, it's hard to communicate. 
[03:15:30]  And, you know, let's do this song because someone brought a sign.  That kind of thing.  Right.  Like when I'm alone, I can just do it.  What songs have you tried?  Well, songs that I haven't ever really tried to play acoustically, I've tried before.  I remember someone yelled out Fourth of July for a Soundgarden song, which is sort of ridiculous  to even try on an acoustic.  And I started to try to bang that out and sing it.  And then, you know, people usually will come up with just dumb ideas. 
[03:16:00]  Like, you know, if it's an acoustic guitar, they'll be screaming Jesus Christ pose.  I don't know if you think they're funny or whatever, but it sounds a little like bluegrass, though, if you try to play it on a acoustic thing.  I really think it's just people hoping, you know, please play that.  And it's like, no, they just want to hear it.  And they think maybe you can make it sound like a record without any drums.  It's virtually impossible.  You don't understand how hard that is to do, right?  You cannot do that.  What kind of covers do you do, I guess, I was asking, too? 
[03:16:30]  Oh, I don't know anything I can think of.  When I was in Jersey, I did a couple Springsteen songs.  That went over good.  It always does.  You know, you're in Jersey, you play Springsteen, it works.  Yeah, you're pretty safe.  That's a safe bet with that one.  Do you remember seeing Anthony in California?  You're an ass.  I'm making sure he remembers.  Oh, at the hotel?  Yeah, yeah, we were at the Beverly Hills.  You were getting your house painted.  No, I think my house flooded.  Oh, yeah, something new.  You were getting it fixed or something.  But it was kind of cool because, like, you know, everybody sees Chris on stage, fucking epitome of the rock star. 
[03:17:00]  And he's there, you know, saying what this kid's like, hey, don't splash.  It's like seeing the dad, Chris Cornell, was kind of an odd, out of place, but very cool thing.  Because you came across, I don't know, you know, you could be the worst father in the world,  but you came across as a great dad, like really attentive and stuff.  But it was the weirdest thing to see in real life. 
[03:17:30]  It was completely out of context, you know.  Hey, yeah, oh, yeah, look, he's swimming over there.  They're riding on his back.  And it's like, hey.  Being a father.  Black hole sun guy.  Did the kids ask who he was?  Like, who's the man with no shirt and a beer in each hand talking way too loud for this hotel?  All right, shut up.  I do like that cabana service over there.  Yeah.  That is very, very nice.  No, I, uh, did you, uh, did somebody, I read on something, did you, um, you get, did you stop  drinking in like 2000 or something? 
[03:18:00]  I think it was 2002.  Was there one of those big reasons or just kind of a, let me, you know.  I don't remember any of the reasons already about the five or six surrounding years to  be honest.  Oh, okay.  Um.  Maybe that was it.  But I'm glad I stopped drinking.  Like, I'm, I'm, uh, I feel like I get a lot more done.  Were you, were you afraid creatively?  Like, uh.  No, I was never anyone that could, I could never write anything, um, drunk or high on it. 
[03:18:30]  It never worked.  Really?  I would try, but it would be awful.  Like if I, especially if I wrote lyrics and, and then, you know, the next morning would  read it, I would immediately burn it.  I didn't want anyone to ever even see it.  Wow.  Oh yeah.  I was horrible at that.  Cause some people are really good at that.  And then, you know.  No, I've heard that story, but I remember I was in rehab and there were, there were people  saying, so is, you know, it's going to be very difficult for you to transition into being  creative when you're not loaded.  And the, and I'm, no, not for me.  Um, coffee was the only thing that ever worked for me, which still works. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, for writing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Coffee rules.  I, when, when I would drink, I think creatively the best thing I could do was, you know, kind  of get into those long, really bad blues jams.  Drunken guys get into it.  Never ends.  So the time you can really put up with that and have the attention span for it.  Um, which is really depressing.  So then, you know, that's all over.  Um.  Can you sit down and say, I'm going to write right now.  I need to write.  Or does it just kind of like you wake up at three in the morning with lyrics or, or, or a 
[03:19:30]  idea or something?  I think both those things happen.  Um, and probably to anybody that, that writes anything, probably both those things happen.  At some point, you'll end up in a position where you have to sit down and, and you have  no ideas and you got to write something.  And it's like, God, I told these people this would be ready, you know?  Oh, like a deadline or something.  That's got to be a little bit of pressure.  Something like, you know, like in a, with a band, um, like working with Soundgarden, there's,  there's a lot of co-writing scenarios where, um, you know, I'm, I'm going to take your song 
[03:20:00]  home and work on it and then come back and we'll have something.  And, you know, it's a, it can't necessarily wait for lightning to strike.  I always feel like that's the best way to go though.  Just wait around until I just pop into it.  Until something.  Yeah.  Um.  With, with the keeper, was, was that written specifically for the movie?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Uh, what's the movie?  Uh, Machine Gun Preacher?  Machine Gun Preacher, yeah.  Machine Gun Preacher.  So, do you find that harder to, uh, write something on a subject like, here's a movie, 
[03:20:30]  hey, hey, write this, because like I, I told you last time you were on, the, uh, the Casino  Royale, uh, opening theme is, is fantastic.  Uh, I, I love it as just a regular song, not even as a, a movie theme.  Well, thank you.  Is it harder to, to say, hey, here's a movie, here's what the movie's about, or?  Well, I guess, you know, with the, with an entire film, you know, and a script and a  story, something like the keeper where, um, it's based on, um, the Machine Gun Preacher 
[03:21:00]  who's a real guy, and it's his real life, and the scope of his life is really crazy,  and, uh, you know, it's like, he goes from meth-head biker to born-again Christian to  guy that, that, uh, builds an orphanage in, like, a, a, a demilitarized zone in, in, uh,  South Sudan, and he likes to shoot people, but he, but he's a humanitarian, and, like,  there's a lot to go on to write a song with that.  That's kind of true.  Yeah, a lot of, a lot of material there.  But it's also not, like, uh, it's, it's for a film, it's a, it's a collaboration with 
[03:21:30]  people making a movie and a screenwriter, and, and so the, I can't just do whatever I  want.  So they do have input on the song itself?  Well, I get pretty lucky most of the time when I've been in situations like that, um.  I'm good enough to, uh.  They just like it.  Yeah, yeah, they just like it.  I've also had the other, where, yeah, I'm not sure if that works, I'm not sure if we  like it, but the, the, usually things just go well.  Yeah.  I think if you try.  You really, you know, give it a whirl. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, just try to do a good job, and it usually works out.  Do they tell you if they want it to be acoustic or heavy, or they just kind of leave all that  up to you?  Pretty much left all that up to me on this.  And, and, with Machine Gun Preacher, it was hard, because the, there's sort of like this  period of, of, uh, earlier in his life, it's kind of like, but maybe biker rock,  70s, and then, um, then, there, I could have approached it from a gospel-oriented thing  when he, when he's sort of becoming this preacher, but then the, um, there's African 
[03:22:30]  music, uh, Sudanese choir, there's hip-hop, and, um, there's all these different, uh, periods  in the story where different kinds of music could fit in, and somehow or another, I ended  up with just an acoustic guitar and singing, and I'm not really sure how that works.  You look at everything, you go, that's just too much shit here.  Let me grab a guitar.  Are you actually singing, singing the movie plot, or no, you're not singing about the,  are you singing something that fits it thematically, or actually what goes on in the movie?  Yeah, my approach was like, because, you know, I don't know what it's like to, to be, uh, 
[03:23:00]  one of the children that the story's about, or, or, uh, uh, Sam Childers, and, and, you  know, I'm not him, so I didn't have those experiences, so I ended up kind of approaching  it like, what if, what if Sam Childers were Woody Guthrie, and he was writing a song about  this situation, and the, and the plight of these kids, and his dedication to, to, uh,  risking his life to just make sure they're safe, and that's where the idea came from.  Yeah, because that, that, that to me is the, is the hard part, is capture, because I know 
[03:23:30]  I would just, I'm not a songwriter, but I know I would just write, like, scene by scene,  just, you know, make it all hacky, and then the man got on the plane, you know, I would  just, your song, your song would be 90 minutes long, it would be awful.  It would be literal dialogue from the movie, every single, and he ducked in, I thought he  was shot, but he was fine, it would be like, this stinks, you were, uh, you were, uh, I  guess a big part of the, uh, the Pearl Jam movie, you said the documentary, yeah, in the,  in the, uh, documentary, yeah, uh, Cameron Crowe, uh, film, yeah, yeah, about, 
[03:24:00]  uh, which was great, he did, he did an amazing job, and it's, um, it, it's, it's a  great, it's a great documentary for fans, because I feel like, you know, you really  kind of get to see behind the curtain a little bit, and, and, everybody's  personality comes across very genuine, and, and then it's a Cameron Crowe film,  which, he's, he's a guy that was a music journalist from the time he was, I don't  know, 15, 14, um, and then, so he was interviewing Led Zeppelin when he was 
[03:24:30]  15, and then he became an accomplished movie maker, so he put those two things  together, and, it, it, it's really an entertaining film, it's great.  Yeah, Ron Travis here is a, a giant, uh, Pearl Jam fan, so, he won't shut the fuck  up about it.  Got a lot of Pearl Jam fans here.  No, I know, it's, uh.  I fucking love Pearl Jam.  It's amazing.  I can't wait to see this thing.  You should, you should actually show Chris the Mexican guy, or the Chilean guy. 
[03:25:00]  Did you see the Chilean guy yet?  Have you seen this Chilean guy that sings, someone get on the, it's really quick, he  does yellow lead better.  Oh, really?  Travis, I thought I saw Travis.  Even for 30 seconds, you gotta see this.  It's ridiculous.  It's a show called, uh, My Name Is, but it's in, uh, Mi Nombre Es.  Yeah, Mi Nombre Es, out of Chile.  Out of Chile.  And they get these people, and they dress up, uh, as much as they can, uh, as, uh, somebody,  a singer, and, and they get up and sing as best they can in the style of. 
[03:25:30]  And most of them are pretty goofy, and they can't speak English, so they're just speaking  phonetically.  A bunch of them are, they're off, you could tell.  And this guy's like, Mi Nombre Es, Eddie Vedder.  Right.  And, and, and he starts singing, and I was like, at first, I swear to you, I was like,  wait, no, this is bullshit.  They fucking, yeah.  They, like, overdubbed this thing on here.  Here he is.  I'll be your DS.  You got the headphones?  You need some ears.  Mi Nombre Es, Eddie Vedder.  Eddie, Eddie Vedder.  It's like a sort of a contest, too.  Yeah.  It's one of those things.  We want to see Eddie Vedder in this scenario. 
[03:26:00]  We're going to go.  We're going to go.  I thought he was lying.  Oh my God, that's pretty amazing.  I swear, I thought they were.  And there's something listening and getting ready to judge it.  Yeah.  That'll be worth doing at an actual Pearl Jam show, just for a minute.  Yeah, I know, right?  To have him come out and just see everybody look confused and upset.  And upset.  The guy is doing an amazing job. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.  And this is what they'll do.  If Eddie Vedder leaves Pearl Jam, they'll just fucking cart this guy out the way they did  in Journey.  Yeah, you can hit it.  That's just...  Isn't that wild?  When I first saw it, I was like, come on.  They friggin' overdubbed or something.  Some goofy guy found this show clip and popped friggin' Pearl Jam on top of it.  You ever find anyone that does you real well, Chris?  No.  You know, I've had people send me stuff.  Hey, Chris, I sound just like you.  Check it out.  Do you?  There'll be like just a moment, you know, where I kind of hear it, but most of the time 
[03:27:00]  I don't hear it.  Well, over the years you've got to realize, you know, without the pat on your own back  that you've got a pretty good voice, good range.  I think I do a lot of stuff, so it's hard.  I remember Timmy C from Rage used to say that he didn't really know where home base was  for my voice.  Like, there's no real...  Yeah, like if you're writing...  Oh, that's what he does all the time. 
[03:27:30]  Or if you're writing for your range, yeah.  And I think that comes from songwriting.  Whatever it is, I just kind of want to hear the singer that's going to sound right.  You know, and so I've never paid much attention to range.  Yeah.  We would be like, oh, I want to hear that melody, and it would be whatever key the song  was in, and then that would just be it.  So many singers want to, like, punch you in the face right now that you just say that  like, I never thought about range.  Right.  Like, some people are just like, I'd love to be able to hit that note, and it's just  like, nah, he could just hit it. 
[03:28:00]  Not from the...  There's all in the job training, like the several years of, you know, like the early years of  Soundgarden.  We joined...  Started in 1984.  Jesus.  So it was a while of really being in a band and playing shows and doing it.  I definitely...  I had very little range when I started it.  Really?  Yeah.  You were able to crank it up?  Holy shit.  Man, that is amazing.  And then over the years, how do you take care of it?  Do you have to? 
[03:28:30]  Well, it helps not to drink and smoke.  Oh, well.  That makes it easier.  Does it?  Other than that, yeah.  It's all the obvious things, really.  It's just the obvious things, you know.  You can't drink like a fish, smoke cigarettes, or weed, or...  Yeah, and you can a little bit, but, like, a lot doesn't work.  Yeah.  But, uh...  For much, really.  I mean, there's not a whole lot you can do.  You can shoot pool or play shuffleboard.  You can get those things done.  You can do a lot of sports.  When you're in a band and you're out doing solo stuff, do other band members get resentful? 
[03:29:00]  Like, whoever's out doing the solo stuff, whether it's a singer or the guitarist, do they  start to feel, like, almost like you're leaving a relationship to do this?  Well, with Soundgarden, everybody always did stuff.  I mean, Matt and I did Temple of the Dog in 1990, and, you know, I think that was sort  of a testament to just the trust that we had inside of the band, that it's okay to go 
[03:29:30]  out and do other stuff and know that you're kind of safe in your band and everyone's secure  in the fact that this is what everybody, you know, is dedicated to all the time.  Is there ever a time where the band wants to do something, but you're like, oh, no, the  solo stuff's booked.  I can't, uh...  I can't.  Not really.  You try to work it out, I would imagine, right?  Not really.  I think at this stage of being in Soundgarden, it's kind of good that everybody's doing other  things because...  The break is healthy, I would assume. 
[03:30:00]  Well, I like to be really, really, really busy, and I think that, you know, to have  that, to have that all sort of fall on the shoulders of Soundgarden probably isn't that  great of a thing.  I think for us to be able to do what we do with a more relaxed pace and not have, like,  two-year projections of what our schedule's going to be and release dates before we've  written any songs for a record, that never really worked for us. 
[03:30:30]  Why didn't you guys go back to the Temple of the Dog thing?  Why didn't you go back to the Temple of the Dog thing?  It was 1990, and you guys had some magic there.  Another album or something.  We were in separate bands that were really busy.  Yeah.  But there was never time in the last, what, it's been 20 years now, to get back and try  to do something else with that?  I don't know.  Maybe because of the fact that it was something...  For Andrew.  It took a couple of weeks to do it, and then it was very special, and it surrounded kind 
[03:31:00]  of a subject that was sort of important to us, being that it was a tribute to our friend  that died.  And I'm not sure if it necessarily would have felt natural to, like, at least, you know,  to go back and write other songs or record it.  It would be fun to play shows or something and play the songs more.  Yeah.  Because we've only done it, you know, every six years or so, somehow something will happen 
[03:31:30]  when we get together and play.  Have you noticed a big change in personality-wise?  Because you guys were, you know, kids in Soundgarden originally, and now you're men, guys.  Have you noticed huge personality changes in some of the guys where you're like, wow,  that guy's really changed?  I feel like with everybody, you know, even other guys in Seattle bands that I grew up  with, everybody's pretty similar to the way they always were.  I just sort of see everyone being a little less goofy and having more patience, I think. 
[03:32:00]  That's just growing up with anybody, yeah.  Doesn't necessarily have to do with where you're from.  I think doing solo stuff, too, it's like, it's got to be resentful when there's four  people creatively collaborating, or five people.  It's got to be annoying to have someone's ideas always overriding yours, or the one guy  with the shit idea that everybody has to politely listen to.  At least you can go out and do it, and it gets it out of the system, so there's no one  just resenting the fact that their ideas can't be, I guess, made real or brought to fruition, 
[03:32:30]  as we say.  Well, yeah, I think that's sort of where side projects from bands usually come, because  the people, you know, it's not always going to make sense that something one guy in a band  is going to want to do doesn't work for the band.  Maybe it just, you know, there's a lot of things I've done since the beginning of Soundgarden  that didn't necessarily make sense for Soundgarden.  It wouldn't fit, and I think that's where those side projects come from most of the 
[03:33:00]  time with any band.  He had a great song.  I don't remember the name of the song, but it was on Slash's record, which was really  good.  Yeah, it was fun.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, that was an amazing album.  Did you write that, or did he write that, and just ask him to come in for it?  He wrote the guitar parts, and I just kind of took that and wrote to it, really, and responded  with emails of MP3s.  Oh, God, just back and forth.  Yeah, we were in the studio the day that I came in to sing it, and it was, you know, 
[03:33:30]  it was the final version of the music, but initially it was just a demo that he sent me via email,  and then I recorded over it and sent it via email back, which is weird, but, you know.  The future.  Strangely, it works.  What do you do?  How do you tell somebody if they're sending you ideas that are just atrocious?  Like, even if it's a guy you respect, and he's like saying, oh, no, maybe you should  sing this, and you're like, ugh.  You go dark for a really, really unreasonably long time.  Send him back corrupted files. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, I'm trying.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  Yeah, you get emails that are just question marks, like, where are you?  Right.  You just ignore it.  Yeah, you don't actually say, like, that was hard.  You just actually come back with something that's better, and just go, no, here's what  I got.  I didn't see that.  No, you just ignore it.  Just ignore it.  When you write so much, you've written a lot of songs.  Do you start feeling like you've...  Have you ever written anything where you've looked at and gone, wait a minute, I've done  that before.  God.  Like, I guess you don't want to be redundant. 
[03:34:30]  I've actually done stuff twice, where I'll realize this was an idea I already had, and  maybe I just didn't record it.  But what's way worse than that is I'll get some melody in my head and think that it's  really great, and then I'll realize it's someone else's song.  Yeah.  Almost exactly.  To a T.  Sounds good for a minute, right?  Yeah.  All the glitters is gold.  I've heard that.  This is really hooky and great.  It's like, oh, the Beatles did this.  This is so catchy.  I love it.  It's going to be great. 
[03:35:00]  I don't know what.  It's like as though I've heard it before.  Oh, shit.  Guys, I got it.  I saw her standing there.  Yeah.  Like a virgin.  Yeah.  I don't know why I like that.  I think it's a great idea.  I think it might go over big with the kids.  Will you just scrap the idea, or will you go, all right, because maybe you add a little  bit to it, and you don't realize that you got the basic foundation from somewhere else.  Will you scrap the whole idea, just go, fuck it, I can't, or will you just build on it?  Yeah, if it's exactly something else. 
[03:35:30]  I think a lot of the time, you can play me in kind of any song, and I might be able  to tell you two or three things that have similar notes or similar.  But if that happens, that's okay.  But if it's just one thing, it's kind of a carbon copy of somebody else's song.  Yeah.  And it happens.  It's amazing how it goes.  I haven't really heard Soundgarden, at least, be guilty of something like that.  That's because there's quality control in places somewhere. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not going to get to you.  Yeah, yeah.  Somebody's going to say, that sounds exactly like blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, the song's never going to make the show.  You're like, no way.  You play it and go, shit, it is.  Yeah, the song's not going to make the album.  You've got to have people like that around you, though.  Like Lady Gaga, who I like, got a lot of shit because that one song sounded like Madonna,  a lot like Madonna.  And nobody around her probably, because she's solo, said to her, you can't do that.  It sounds just like, you know, Madonna in a band, at least you can call each other out  and go, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah.  That's true. 
[03:36:30]  That's what's great about a band.  That's what creates the identity of the band.  That's what sort of serves the fans.  You know, you can't do, you can't take hard right turns if you're in a band that's truly  democratic.  You know, you can't go hard to the right or hard to the left because you've got a bureaucracy  that is going to sort of slow that down at least a little bit.  Would you guys ever work with Black Sabbath?  Like on the road or something?  That'd be great.  Cool.  Obviously, I played a show with Black Sabbath in Germany and it was unbelievable. 
[03:37:00]  Wow.  Because that would have been like five years ago.  Was it on OddsFest?  No, it was just like a German festival.  Oh.  And we played and then they came out and it was really incredible.  I was blown away.  Everybody was great.  The only thing that was a little weird was the drummer had an actual guy crouched down  beside the hi-hat using his fingers to count off measures and beats to the guy. 
[03:37:30]  So it would be sort of one, two, and then two.  So he always kind of knew where he was.  He didn't really look at the guy, but the guy was there in case he needed to look at  the guy.  That's really odd.  I think Bill Ward's Bill Ward.  I wonder if his hearing is going a little bit.  I don't know.  Play with a click or something.  Maybe he just got lost.  I mean, it can happen, I guess, over time where you sort of...  Wow.  Your mind can wander, but he didn't.  Your mind can wander.  He never seemed to need it, but the guy was there for him. 
[03:38:00]  I don't understand what that one, two, three, like how would that help during a song?  I mean, I'm not musically inclined.  If you get lost in the song, yeah, I would rather you just look down and keep the beat  to the guy's fingers and regardless of what you're hearing, you know you're on.  You're doing your part.  They were so good.  It was really incredible.  I mean, that's when you stop and go, yeah, that's how you do it.  That's how the real guys do it.  Have you noticed Ozzy's voice sounds a lot better now?  It's weird.  I think he quit drinking.  He sounds like a lot healthier now than he did five years ago.  Well, something about that. 
[03:38:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  If you pause and look at certain things, I don't know.  I always felt like he was just sort of uniquely him.  So I've always liked his voice live.  I always felt like he did a great job.  Yeah, even when it cracks, it's still fun.  He's still Ozzy.  He forgets the fucking worst over the mountain 30 seconds into the show.  Who cares?  It's still great.  He would do that.  He would just start singing the last verse first, and nobody gave a shit. 
[03:39:00]  It just worked.  No.  I'm singing the right ones.  You know what?  It's 10.15.  I don't want to step on Ron and Fez's time.  Chris Cornell, new song on iTunes, I guess, The Keeper, right?  Yeah, we're going to play it again.  Might as well play it again.  It's great.  It's from Machine Gun Preacher.  Yep.  And the dates for all the tours.  He's going to be doing Carnegie Hall here in New York, November the 11th.  I'm sorry, November the 21st of this year.  And there's a bunch of dates, including the Borgata and, you know, Allentown.  There's Count Basie and Red Bank. 
[03:39:30]  Just go to chriscornell.com and get the dates because he's playing everywhere.  It's all written down here, too, on this sheet of paper, and I'm going to take it because  I have no idea what my tour is.  Dare to take that with you so you know where you're going to be?  Thank you.  Chris, thanks, man.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure talking to you.  Thank you.  And Patrice O'Neal, where are you at?  Stress Factory, tonight and tomorrow.  Yes.  There you go.  Chris, O'Neal.  And Jimmy?  Tampa, Florida, Improv, September 29th through October 1st.  Pittsburgh, Improv, October 20th through 22nd. 
[03:40:00]  I'll be in my yard with a beer.  Yes.  That's about it.  Yeah.  And after that, you can just put any day dash 2011.  All right.  We're going to leave you with Chris Cornell's song, The Keeper.  Have a good weekend.  I come from far away  My boots don't own this ground 
[03:40:30]  But they know it's real  It doesn't take too long  For this road to become  A battlefield  And before I let one more fire go out  Understand that I won't give one inch of ground  From beneath  Yours and my feet 
[03:41:00]  Whatever the prize happens to be  I may not be the keeper of the flame  But I am the keeper  Beauty and truth collide 
[03:41:30]  Where love meets genocide  Where laughter meets fear  Confusion all around  As I try to feed these mouths  That I've never known  That I've never known  Singing  And before I let one more tear hit the ground  I will be the one  Standing between you and the sound of the rounds 
[03:42:00]  Echoing out, out of the dark  The smoke and the spark  And at the heart of the flame  I am the keeper  I cannot see the light 
[03:42:30]  At the end of the tunnel tonight  My eyes are weary  And before I let one more life give you grace  From the ashes I will rise for you  And the ghosts of the names  The faces and frames  The love and the pain  For you I'll remain 
[03:43:00]  For you I'll remain  Though I'm not worthy of  Being the keeper of the flame  I am the keeper  I am the keeper  I am the keeper  The keeper  The virus 
[03:43:30]  Sirius XM  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Oh you betcha 
[03:44:00]  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  Paul you missed  Our new intern  And the Ron and Fez intern  Marveling  Over the fact that there were two people named Matt  As if that was a very uncommon name  Wow  Your name's Matt  My name's Matt  I think it's a very interesting coincidence  You guys should hang out  That's Matt  He's the new intern  Eric  Yeah  Hello  After  Yesterday's show  Yesterday's after show  Not to be confused with yesterday's show show 
[03:44:30]  Which sounded very familiar  Because it had a host in common  Jim Norton?  No Jim Norton was not the host of the after show yesterday  I was referring to myself  Oh right  That's right  I know  I was forgettable for the first four hours  But I was here for the last one  How's this new intern doing?  Because he wanted to do the after show today  That's fine  It's your show if you want to have him on  Well I don't mind having anybody on  You know whether it's new intern Matt 
[03:45:00]  Josh Matthews or Paul  It doesn't matter to me  But it's important that you're his supervisor correct?  Yeah  So it's important to me that we get your approval on this  Yeah this is fine  How's he working out today?  I know it's his first day  So you don't  It's hard to gauge  Yeah it's really hard to gauge  He's a nice dude  He seems pretty cool  We had him doing some just kind of  You know  Menial work  Because we got to get him into the swing of audio production  And how we do things around here  But I think so far today  He's done alright  Well I saw Sal  Who's like a 
[03:45:30]  Who's a proven go-getter at this point  He's just closing out his second week  Hang on I'll send him in  Okay  Sal's a Vietnam vet  I hear from Roland  Well I mean  Roland probably exaggerated  As I said he's closing out his second week  Tour of Vietnam would be much more difficult  The most interesting part of my day  So far  Yeah  Oh we asked?  Well  Paul's very hostile  I thought you'd want to know  Here's the thing you should know about Paul  He's extremely hostile  And that's because  He spent a year as an intern  And you're the first intern he's interacting with 
[03:46:00]  That's true  So it's like whatever you say  And I was noticing you were doing it to Sal too  Whatever they say  You just jump down their throats  Well that's not entirely true  Because I actually  I will show Sal certain things  Because  Oh  He's here to learn  Hotline  Hold on  Hello you're on the after show  Yeah  The new intern  What's his name?  Matt  Yeah Matt  Yeah  God  The face I got this morning  Walking down the hall  Yeah  To the studio 
[03:46:30]  Uh huh  It was  Now we haven't had interns  In how long?  Nine months is how long we went  Nine months  I almost  Started remembering  Why it's been a pleasant nine months  Well  I gotta be honest with you  I came around the corner  And I see  Uh  Our own Iraq  You know  King of the interns  You bet  Uh  With uh  The new intern  Yeah  And  And he gave me this book  And I think it was  This half  Hearted 
[03:47:00]  Try to say hi thing  Yeah  It was  It was  It was very awkward  It was very awkward  And nervous  And it just  It made me like  I went like  Oh god  Well  Not this again  From like  Uh  Well Anthony  You're a big star  He's gonna talk over me  Oh I'm sorry  I definitely have picked up  That uh  Uh  Matt  Is  A huge  Fan of the show  That's become  Which is not a bad thing  Sal is also a big fan  But he's also uh  Yeah  He's a bit more  Starstruck 
[03:47:30]  Uh  Than some  You know  There's that  That class of intern  That kind of gets  Very starstruck  When they see  You guys for the first time  I picked up on that  And the fact that  It surprised him  Like  It wasn't like  Okay  I'm going into the studio  I know they're in there  Like I could  I could you know  I could kind of  Fake it  Walk in  Like I came in  The side door  Came around the corner  And he was right there  Yeah  And I freaked him out  Well and he's also  Um  Like 
[03:48:00]  He  Sal  Who's been here for a couple weeks now  Who's kind of you know  He's been a little more low key  Kind of staying under the radar  Just learning everything  He has to learn  Uh  Came in  And he was  Showing him how to clean up the studio  And I'm not saying this is a bad thing  This is just a different personality  Immediately  He goes  Hey Sam  Can I be on the after show today?  I said  I said  Oh boy  I said  Oh boy  You know who that sounds like?  Who?  A young Sam Roberts  Listen  A young go-getter 
[03:48:30]  Who just wants to get on the air  I mean that was my personality  But people don't remember  For the first three months of my internship  I was very quiet  I was not the uh  Outspoken uh  Uh  Shit stirrer  That I turned into  You've more than made up for that  Yeah  Yeah  I guess that's true  But is there any sort of uh  Uh  Edict that we need to put down  Like a rule  Where  Matt can no longer make eye contact with you  Something like that  Although that would be hysterical 
[03:49:00]  Um  No  I think  I think I'll be  Uh  Nice regular guy  Anthony  I just wanted it  To be known  Since he was  You know  Feature  Being featured on the  Shit show  Today  After show  After show  I did notice  Something different  From this guy  Then I noticed  What's the first intern that we had  What's his name  And his name's Sal  Oh yeah right right  Then him  Then the other one  He was  He was kinda cool about the whole thing  Right  And then I was like  Oh yeah  That's what these interns are about 
[03:49:30]  I forgot  They get that weird  Fucking shocked look on their face  It's very odd  Ed before  Before you hang up on me  I wanna give  Yes  I wanna give new intern Matt  The chance  Yes  To talk to his radio idol  Not me  But Anthony Cumia  Yes  For the first time on the air  Matt what would you like to  This is Anthony  From this  From Opie and Anthony  Well  Well Anthony  If I must say yes  I was a little uh  Starstruck  Uh  It was uh  It was walking in 
[03:50:00]  It was like seeing uh  A president  Or uh  George Clooney  Or uh  I don't know  Bret Michaels or something  So uh  It was just like  I wasn't sure of the protocol  Cause everyone was like  Hey don't say hi to Kenny  Cause like  Kenny's a little anal about things  And like  Don't talk to him  So I wasn't sure  If you were the same way  Like if I was supposed to say hi  Or  Just kinda ignore you  And I guess I kinda went in the middle  And just gave you a creepy  Half look  And so I apologize  But hopefully uh  Monday I'll give you a nice uh 
[03:50:30]  Uh  Bear hug  And a kiss on the lips  And uh  I know you're not a germaphobe  Or anything  I should have told you  At the beginning of that  That he had hung up  Oh  I should have mentioned that  Before you went on  I'm not surprised  I looked at the phone bank  He wasn't there anymore  You are young Opie  I didn't want to  What do you mean I'm young Opie  You're young Opie  You're Opie Junior  Opie Junior  Yes  My dad  That's not my dad  Eric  You wish Opie was your dad  What are you talking about  I have a great relationship with my 
[03:51:00]  Eric  This is not going well  Yeah  You've been to my house  Right Eric  You've met my family  Yes  I have a good relationship  With my dad right  Very good relationship  With your dad  Did you ever get the vibe  As a matter of fact  I've brought my dad  Into  The Opie and Anthony universe  Yes  You brought him into the world  Have you ever gotten the impression  That I wanted a different father  No  And I mean  That would  I hang out with Opie  From time to time  But I don't think  I mean Sal  You've been here for a couple weeks  Do I seem like  I want Opie to be my dad 
[03:51:30]  No  For sure  No I said Sal  Oh okay  I miss her  That's great  I don't like him  You don't like Opie  Why not  He's a good guy  I like Opie  Eric you heard what I heard there  I heard I isolated it  Paul you've been  You were an intern for a year right  Yes  Did I  I know  I'm affectionate toward Opie  The same way I'm affectionate toward Anthony  And Jim  You seemed like you guys were friends  But that's like  As far as it went  There was no hero worship  Or daddy issues  I mean a mentor could be  Yeah okay 
[03:52:00]  The same way  But the same way  Anthony would be like a mentor  And we know Opie sure doesn't treat you  With any kind of like  Father son respect  Yeah I mean  If there was a father son thing going on  I would have to call child services  Because I'm treated horribly by Opie  Well it's  He's a disciplinarian  But I'm 28 years old  Yeah but don't you still live at home  No  Oh  I've been living  I thought you did  No  Okay  Just cause I'm  He's like a super fan who has everything wrong  Everything's wrong  Yeah it's totally off 
[03:52:30]  I live with Jess in Westchester  I'm very public about all my information  I mean  Sal  Yes  I'm not private about almost anything  Weren't you two cheering about Westchester yesterday  Or something on the after show  Me and Sal  We're Westchester buddies  Yes  But yeah I mean  Best Chester  It is the best Chester  But I've been in  It's alright  You don't think so  I mean it's okay  It's not bad  It's not bad  I've been in three different apartments already  I mean  Again I'm 28  I mean I know I don't make a lot of money here 
[03:53:00]  That's been documented  But I'm not  Living in my parents basement  And work  And hosting the Opie and Anthony show yesterday  For God's sake  Hey Sam  Did you get married yet?  No I am engaged though  Yes  You may want to take line one  That's it  Okay  Bobo?  No  Welcome to the after show  Dad  What the hell is this?  That's actually my dad calling  How's it going?  This is the graciousness I get 
[03:53:30]  For wiping your tail  When you were little  And all around  No  There's been a lot of confusion  As I publicly stated many times  I'm not looking  For a new father figure  At this stage in my life  Roland just walked in  My dad's on the phone  Because the new intern Matt  Just went on the air  And said  I heard everything wrong  First he said I was the new Opie  And then he said I was Opie Junior  And then he said I wanted Opie to be my father  Dad  I need you to know  This is coming out of this new intern's mouth 
[03:54:00]  Who's known me for all of  Four hours  Where is Matt going to intern  Starting tomorrow?  Rod and fuzz  That's a great question  Yeah I hope  You weren't distressed  Dad  How has mom been doing since  Friday  What day did they  When Amy  This has been a tough week  Yeah it has been a tough week  What hurt her more  Was it that  There was a room full of comedians  Tearing her apart  And calling her social club 
[03:54:30]  A lesbian gathering  Or that Paul's mom brought in pies  Well I think that  I think that probably  What struck her closer  Was the fact that they  That they challenged her social  Standing in the community  She didn't like that  Because she is  I don't know if this came across  On the air  But she's the press director  Of the women's society  Yeah and you know  I mean she's  She's angling to  She's angling to be  The garden club representatives  Yeah  Now 
[03:55:00]  Dad  How do you feel  When you hear Matt  The new intern  Come on the air  And say these things  It's kind of challenging  Our relationship  Who the hell is Matt?  Yeah  Where did he come from?  I mean  I came from  From Rochester  Rochester  Yeah  That's fitting  Yeah  I think people are starting to  Pick up on where I got  Some of my smart assiness  From that  Yeah definitely 
[03:55:30]  Matt is there anything  That you'd like to say  To my father  After some of the things  That you said?  Mr. Roberts  You raised  A wonderful son  With a wonderful haircut  And a great rowdy  Dude is he  Rowdy Roddy Piper  No  This doesn't sound sincere at all  Yeah it doesn't  I mean  I'm totally sincere  I bought this t-shirt  Like two weeks ago  It had nothing to do  With my dad  It's a terrific t-shirt  I'll stick with  The great son  Lose it on the hair  Well listen 
[03:56:00]  I mean  My hair may not be great  But dad  Your handlebar mustache  Is very well documented  Well yeah  We all have our styles  Don't we?  Okay yeah we do  Listen  I have to go take a nap  I'm all  Alright I'll talk to you later  He knows  He knows when to punch out  He's got good timing  My favorite moment  Of my father on the show  And nobody laughed at this  Except me  Because I knew what he was doing  And he was  He was pulling in  Some of that Robert's charm  Is when 
[03:56:30]  Probably a year and a half  After Anthony had broken up  With Jill Nicolini  He walks into the room  Oh right  And says as if he's confused  Hey where's the weather girl?  And Ant like  Awkwardly said  Well sir  We actually aren't together anymore  We broke up  But he just created  This awkward situation  Pretending he had no idea  When he listens to the show  All the time  Obviously  I mean  He just called in  I saw the caller ID  He called in on a phone number  That Eric doesn't have  He called in on his own 
[03:57:00]  The Robert's shit stirs  Well I mean  You're  Look  If anybody's a shit stirrer  In this room  Jesus  I mean  Sal  You've been here the whole time  He's making a great first impression  Who's been shit stirring?  He's insulting your dad  I know  You've got one guy  Who's sitting here  I love Mr. Robbins  For the record  He's shitting on the after show  Not that other phrase  That most people would say  Right there  I like that  What phrase?  Well  Sal's a little too smart  Don't attack Sal  He's not gonna  He's been here  He's got two weeks  You want to see my scar?  Roland 
[03:57:30]  What?  He's talking  A vet  Vietnam  Oh okay okay  Roland was whipping me yesterday  Roland I told you not to whip the interns  How many times?  I mean  I know you have frustrations  We went over how tough your job is  But  Don't whip the interns  For the last time  Alright buddy?  I did not whip the interns  Alright well  I'm gonna take Sal's word  He's got the scars  Roland went to take a shit today  And he came back  And he was just  Covered in beads of sweat  And he's like  No it's not sweat  It's water  I put water on my face  But you don't think it was water? 
[03:58:00]  No I don't think so  It's a good shit  Fantastic  Now  Well he let me join that shit moment  And then  Hey what's wrong  Like when I walk in  I need to sit down  Yeah the post shit  Sort of  Yes  Yeah just like relaxing  It's like when you wake up from a nap  And you're groggy  And you need a minute to process  After a nice  Hardy Roland dump  You need to just sit back  And take it in  He came in and he looked like  He had just lifted up a car  And like moved it  A couple feet  Is that true Roland?  Yeah that's fantastic 
[03:58:30]  Roland's very strong  Now uh  Roland  You're really happy to be here aren't you?  I am  I'm very excited  Paul  Paul you hate him  I really do  I'm not even gonna lie  I just  I'm just trying to feel  Something about him  Is really bothering me a lot  Eric  You gotta make sure  That the relationship  Between Paul and your intern Matt  Is not hostile  Yeah  There's a lot  That's been going on today  That I was not aware of  That I've made some notes  Okay good  Things are gonna have to be changed  Because let me tell you something 
[03:59:00]  We all questioned  How you would be as a leader  But I'm gonna say that  I mean Sal  Has been a fantastic intern  Sal's been amazing  And  Thank you  Sal is really good  If Eric's the leader of the interns  And Sal's your protege  Salador  You gotta give Eric credit for Sal right?  Salador  Absolutely  That's the rule  I love when Roland does that  If you can shit on Eric  When something goes wrong  That's under his watch  If something goes right under his watch  You gotta give the guy credit  And Eric  Gotta give you credit  So far Sal's been gangbusters 
[03:59:30]  Salador  I mean Matt  It's your first day  So you can't be gangbusters yet  I feel like Sal's like  Like the prince intern  Well he is  He's done a great job  And he didn't  Upset my father  So much  That he had to call him  He didn't walk in here  Talking shit  On the first day  Mr. Roberts has a good sense of humor  Do you know that?  I think so  You think that?  I think it runs in the family  He may  Just be  Well he's probably sleeping right now  Because as he said  He's an old man  He needs to take a nap  But when he wakes up  He may be very upset 
[04:00:00]  Roland  I got a text from Liam  Because Chris Cornell was a little late  Because of traffic and stuff  But you and Liam  Were standing in the lobby  Waiting for him  And he  As a matter of fact  Let me read the text  Verbaugham  Yeah he texted me  And I was going to share it with Opie  But there's a camera lady here  And everything was moving and moving  So I figured  It should be on the air  At some point  The text was  From Liam  The talent booker  You were down in the lobby with  Waiting for Chris Cornell this morning 
[04:00:30]  Ugh  Roland is nervously pacing  Around the lobby  Farting  Were you passing gas in the lobby room  Pretty loud too  Pretty loud  Yeah  Trying to like stomp it out  On top  Yeah  You liked that  Yeah  I farted a girl  Turned around  And I was like  How you doing  You're being charming  It was  This is my mating call  You turned around  I said hello  Did you  Did you sneak up the lobby 
[04:01:00]  Because the lobby  I would think it wouldn't matter  Because the lobby  Downstairs  Is a big room  Very tall  Ceiling  Expensive  Yeah  So it's plenty of room  For the air to move freely  It is  And dilute  The Roland gas  As the girl walked by  She was like  What is that  Like  My name is Roland  You're a charmer  You know how to  Were you nervous  Or was it just  Gas  It's my stomach  It gets nervous  It gets nervous  You might not be nervous  But the belly gets it first  The belly gets nervous 
[04:01:30]  The belly hits it first  And when you're waiting  For a guest  You don't give a shit  Who the people walk by  You just let it out  Just let it out  I did notice Roland  Is very nervous  Before the guest comes in  Like he just  He was obsessively  Cleaning off his desk  And he  Windexed his desk down  Very nice  Well I mean  I would say  That's probably a good thing  Because if  You know  Chris Cornell's publicist  Walk in  And they look at  Roland in a shit heap  Like he usually is  When they're not here  They'd probably think  Poorly of you 
[04:02:00]  Right Roland  Yes  I like how everyone  Stops talking  As soon as Matt  Opens his mouth  And just kind of  Stares at him  He may have something  To say  That's right  He doesn't  You don't think so  I don't think so  El's Hotel in Brooklyn  Says handlebar mustache  Is rule  Who's this guy  On  What's his name  On line one  Eric  I don't see it in here  I forgot  I typed it in  I don't know  No problem  202  Whoever you are  You're on the air  Hey Sam  Yeah  I think I know  What Matt was talking about  Whenever he said 
[04:02:30]  That you're  Opie Jr  Yeah  I think he was referring  To the fact  That you are  A shit starter  And so is Opie  Well why can't  Opie be Opie  And Sam be Sam  This man's very smart  And you suck  Because I suck  Yes  Why do you think that  I like E-Rock too  But there's no reason  That that means  I'm no good  Well  You don't suck  You're just  You suck 
[04:03:00]  What do you mean  I try to follow Opie  It just  I don't know  It seems like  You don't have  Your own personality  I don't even  I'm not anything  Like Opie  On the air  We're different  We're very different  But you know  What I like  About people  Who call in  They say you suck  And then if you just  Go slowly and quietly  And say  Well what do you mean  Why do I suck  Then immediately  Every time they go  Well you don't suck  You don't  You don't  And if you  If you just  Keep him talking  Like that conscience  Kicks in a little bit  Like if I just kept him 
[04:03:30]  Talking long enough  He'd be like  You rule Sam  You rule  You are a shit starter though  Alright bye buddy  I don't like that caller  Go ahead  It's just like  Pavarotti  I can't even think  Of an instance  But I mean  It's just  You're following  A great show  And it's  It's no good  Okay well I'll try  To work on it for you  Okay  You're no good  Alright buddy  Alright thanks  We gotta start  Doing Paul  And yeah  I'll have Paul  Write this down  For Monday  I didn't get
