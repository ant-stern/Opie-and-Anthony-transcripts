<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a satirical discussion of the Los Angeles riots following the Lakers' championship win, featuring commentary on the racial dynamics and criticism of Bob Costas' reporting.  They also mocked the Central Park "wilding" investigation's reliance on video technology.  This was followed by a comedic bit about the Yankees' 22-1 victory over the Red Sox, filled with profanity and hyperbole, incorporating impersonations of Don Imus, Christopher Reeve, and Stephen Hawking.  Several listener calls ensued, including one challenging the hosts' hypocrisy, another offering a joke, a confused 12-year-old, and an NYPD officer.  Audio clips from the "55-gallon drum challenge" were played, highlighting a contestant's transformation.  The segment concluded with a promotion for Mujan hair removal strips.

The next segment featured Tabitha, a "55-gallon drum challenge" contestant, in studio.  She described the horrific experience, detailing the disgusting substances and insects involved, and the psychological impact.  Opie and Anthony recounted their enjoyment.  Tabitha then participated in the "Guess What's in My Pants" segment.  Discussion followed about goofball.com, a website with nude celebrity pictures, and a coworker caught viewing gay pornography.  A listener claimed another station stole the "Guess What's in My Pants" segment, and a clip from a Don Imus CD was played.  Callers shared anecdotes about deaf people, and a listener named Malcolm X read lists titled "10 Indisputable Truths White People Know That Black People Won't Admit" and "10 Indisputable Truths Black People Know That White People Won't Admit."  The segment ended with anticipation for an interview with "lesbian ice cream girls."

A New York Sports Clubs commercial preceded a segment featuring Nadia Hilton, Kayla, and Sable.  The segment involved sexually suggestive content and vulgar language, focusing on the women's appearance, particularly their breasts, and their involvement in the adult film industry. Sable discussed her first pornographic film with Nadia Hilton.  A game involved throwing cherries at the women's icing-decorated breasts, resulting in escalating nudity.  The "Vag Elvis" segment, implied to be sexually explicit, was introduced.  Numerous listener calls, many from teenagers, expressed appreciation for the show's explicit content.  Audio clips from the "55-gallon drum challenge" and a call about Lynn Samuels were played. The segment concluded with continued sexually explicit activities with the women.

The final segment centered on "Vag Elvis," a crudely fashioned figure shown on camera, with vulgar descriptions and comparisons to other figures.  Clips from the "55-gallon drum challenge" were replayed.  Nadia, Sable Minx, and Kayla were guests, participating in the Vag Elvis segment and providing website plugs.  The show concluded with a "What did we learn?" segment featuring vulgar and humorous caller takeaways, sexual innuendos, pop culture references, and a giveaway of concert tickets.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I've done them both.  Oh, you guys, we're all...  1027 WNEW.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  That was a great first hour of radio.  Wow.  Woo! 
[00:00:30]  That flew by, huh, Anthony?  It really did.  I think we're going to have a great show.  Oh, yeah.  If the first hour is any indication, that flew.  Our comedic stylings are...  I know a target today.  Oh, yeah.  Felt good right when we sat down at 2.  Hell, yeah.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It's 2 for Tuesday.  2 for Tuesday?  I forgot about that.  That means twice the hilarity today from your pal's O&A. 
[00:01:00]  Twice the insanity.  We're doing two-fers exclusively on WNEW.  2.  2.  2.  2.  2.  2 for Tuesday.  2 for Tuesday on WNEW.  2 for Tuesday.  All right.  What the hell?  Let's put some smiles on our face and...  2 for...  Let's put our smiles on our faces and run through this crap one more time, Ed. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, slap a smile on and plow through this crap one more time.  One more time.  All right.  Okay.  That's good.  So, Opie, uh...  Yes, Anthony.  Big, big basketball fan you are.  I know you were a little disappointed the Knicks weren't in, uh...  In the finals, but, uh...  I was disappointed, but thank God Reggie Miller did not, uh...  Get his goddamn championship.  Doesn't make me happy to see Shaq get one, but...  But it was, uh...  It was, uh...  It was fun.  It was exciting last night. 
[00:02:00]  The Lakers, uh...  Took it all.  Congratulations to the L.A. Lakers.  And they're sweeping up L.A. as we speak.  Yes, they are.  What's up?  Something about, uh...  Other cities like Chicago and L.A.  Uh...  Where else?  Denver, I think they even, uh...  Riot?  Uh...  We don't really get the riots here for sporting events.  Um, no.  No, because, you see, uh...  We have lives in this city.  Maybe that's it.  When was the last time we had a riot?  A good old-fashioned riot when, uh...  One of our teams won a championship? 
[00:02:30]  I can't remember.  It's been a while, right?  I gotta say, though, congratulations to Whitey.  Very, very good, uh...  Showing in your rioting out in L.A.  I was, uh...  Very pleased with Whitey's visibility  and pillaging, burning, uh...  Out in L.A.  A lot of the pictures I saw,  the majority of the people rioting were white people.  Well, yeah.  And then, uh, the ones, uh,  the pictures I did see  where there were, uh, black people involved. 
[00:03:00]  Um, one picture of them  trying to overturn a news truck.  Uh, white people and black people  side by side  working together...  Working together!  ...together in vandalism, Opie.  I, I had a tear in my eye  thinking maybe there is hope  for our society  if we can work together like that.  They were working side by side.  Oh, that's a fiber.  They were working side by side.  No, no indication. 
[00:03:30]  No one cared what color the guy was next to them.  Their goal was just to turn that news truck over,  break the windows, and set it aflame.  They didn't care if the guy helping  was black or Hispanic or white.  Rodney King is proud today, Anthony.  Yes, he is proud.  We all got along in L.A.  When he said,  can't we all just get along?  For once last night,  they all got along  and, uh, destroyed parts of Los Angeles  together as a unit.  Not, uh, not divided by race.  Bob Costas, he's a dope 
[00:04:00]  and he should be shot.  He wrecks every sporting event  that he's a part of.  I remember you were very upset with him.  Oh, my God.  A couple of years ago.  Well, uh, last night,  they're showing the outside of the Staples Center.  And a huge crowd is forming  and they already have, like, a bonfire  right outside the Staples Center.  It's not a national park.  It's a parking lot.  We're not in the woods here.  It's, uh, the middle of a city.  And Bob Costas is like,  oh, a lot of people are starting to gather 
[00:04:30]  to celebrate a possible Lakers victory.  Celebrate.  And, uh, and they have a bonfire.  Well, let's just hope it doesn't get out of hand.  Yeah, sure.  What an idiot.  It shouldn't get out of hand.  Oh, no, we're all going to get marshmallows  and toast them outside the Staples Center.  I saw one of the news trucks  with all the, uh, equipment on the roof.  And, uh, the side doors were open.  There was a crowd of people in front  like it was the effing ice cream man.  And they're just pulling equipment out of the truck  and running away. 
[00:05:00]  It was like a Mr. Softy truck.  And then they, when it was empty,  what'd they do?  They just broke the windows and lit it on fire.  Oh.  Here's, uh, I'm looking at some of the clips now.  It looks like they missed the L.A. riots, Anthony.  Yeah.  Here's a cop silhouetted by a huge fire.  Uh, another picture.  Look at this guy.  Doesn't he understand how totally effed he is?  I know.  He's staring in the camera.  He's got a big Lakers banner.  He's in front of, I think, uh,  overturned, uh, port-a-potties and a fire. 
[00:05:30]  And he's mugging for the camera.  Mugging for the camera.  Something tells me there's going to be another shot of him  very soon.  Uh, profile and front-on  with a few numbers underneath him.  It's like, look what, look what I did  to you again.  Here's a cute shot of, uh,  one of Los Angeles firefighters  extinguishing a burning police car  outside the Staples Center.  That has graffiti on the, uh,  Yeah.  The side of it.  He's got the hose over his shoulder  and he's just squirting, uh,  various foam and, and water into that thing.  Yeah.  Another couple of cops  with, uh, their, uh, nightsticks out 
[00:06:00]  against silhouetted by the flame  of the rioters.  Yeah, that's, that's the dramatic, uh, photo.  Here's the guy, uh, breaking the windshield  of one of the news vans  with a folding chair, O.P.  Well, he has no shirt on,  his hat's on backwards.  White guy.  He's very excited that the Lakers  won the championship.  And if you look to the, to the left,  that's what I'm talking about.  Look, it looks like the ice cream man.  There's a crowd of people  by the open doors.  Just taking whatever.  I don't know what they're going to do  with, like, satellite equipment. 
[00:06:30]  Try to hook it up to their TV  or something.  And here's the shot  that brought a tear to my eye.  Look at this.  Whitey and,  Whitey and black guys  working together  to push over a news van.  To push the news van over.  There is hope.  And, uh, you gotta think  Kobe Bryant feels pretty proud today  to wear a Kobe Bryant jersey.  Yeah, a couple of Kobe jerseys.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then, uh,  the final photo I have,  the police car  just completely in flames.  It looks like it's in the middle  of, uh, exploding. 
[00:07:00]  Exploding.  And there's, uh,  there's a rioter  jumping over the,  the front of the car.  He's, like, got a foot on the hood  and he's kind of jumping  in this celebratory  woo-hoo thing  as the flames, uh, burn.  Unbelievable.  What causes people to do that  because your team won?  Yeah.  My team won.  The team,  not even your team,  a team I watch.  The,  they got the same color jersey  I wear.  So they won.  So we have to burn  the police cars 
[00:07:30]  and crack some windows.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to, uh,  oh, wait,  let me fix the phones here.  Okay.  Marshall, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  How are you?  I'm okay.  What's up?  Sounds like our audience  is getting younger.  Yeah.  Younger and younger.  How are you, Marshall?  I'm okay.  I know, you said that right.  How old are you?  Twelve.  Twelve.  Twelve.  All right.  What do you want to say today?  Yeah, um, you know,  the Lakers win their championship  and then they just, like,  burn this place down. 
[00:08:00]  I don't understand  what their point was.  Exactly.  You know, it's like,  what are they trying to prove?  Just, like,  destroying a bunch of cop cars?  Well, they're very excited  about their team winning.  Very excited, yes.  All right, man.  They could have gone, like,  to a bar and gotten drunk  and just, like,  towards that place  but not a bunch of, like,  cop cars.  Yeah.  All right, Marshall.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Hey.  Good.  So, congratulations  to the Lakers, Anthony.  Yeah.  As we, uh,  sit here without a championship  of another year.  Again. 
[00:08:30]  Again.  Again.  Look what the rest  of the NBA did to us again.  Well, at least it's over.  My God,  that basketball season  lasts a long friggin' time.  Yeah, it's what?  I gotta tell you, dude.  It's like July now, right?  Yeah.  And when did they start?  A few months.  It's amazing.  It just seemed to go on forever.  Yeah, they stretch it out nowadays, so.  O&A are hypocrites with riots.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Let me, let me hear.  Okay.  Tony, what's going on?  Hey, you guys are a bunch  of hypocrites,  in my opinion. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, why is that?  Why is that?  Because if there's a bunch  of black people  and Hispanics,  then you say,  well, you see,  these guys don't know  how to act,  and you go all kinds  of ways around.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, and let them finish.  And yet,  when it's black and white,  now it's okay.  Now we're working together.  Oh, see,  he didn't catch my sarcasm,  you effing friggin' retard, Tony.  What, are you stupid?  No, I'm not stupid.  Tony, you need to know  what sarcasm is  if you're going to listen 
[00:09:30]  to our radio show.  Yeah, I'm real happy  that blacks and whites  are working together  to destroy a city.  You friggin' retard.  You know, people,  do people listen to this show  and actually pay attention  to what we're saying?  I just hope  the average listener  is a little more intelligent  than you, Tony.  Oh, so now...  You're a disgrace.  Look at him.  I'm a retard.  You are a retard.  You don't know  what's frickin' retard.  You don't know  what the sarcasm is.  Do you honestly think...  But you have  a different sarcasm  when it's just us.  You know what I'm saying?  Just us.  If it's just us out there, 
[00:10:00]  then it's like,  oh, you see,  they win a championship  and they don't know  how to act.  They're burning up  their own town.  Oh, my God.  I don't care  what color you are.  You shouldn't be  rioting over  your team winning  a championship.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I think that's the point  we were making.  But the sarcasm  is with Whitey  and Blacky  working together  to riot together  for once.  For once?  That's called sarcasm.  Okay.  For once, huh?  All right.  Well, then I'm wrong  and I won't apologize. 
[00:10:30]  Goodbye.  You don't need  to apologize.  I'm not apologizing.  When are you  turning yourself in,  by the way?  I'm not turning myself in.  I wasn't there.  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, sure.  I wasn't there.  They all say.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Michael,  I still have not  heard you call  the people  that were involved  in the riots  last night  animals.  Okay, you want  to hear it?  They're animals.  Savages.  Did you see  the savages  last night  on the news?  You guys.  Animals and savages.  We should just 
[00:11:00]  quit doing this  radio show  if you don't get  our sarcasm  at times.  We should just  quit because it's  not worth trying  to do anything  on this radio show.  It's called  sarcasm.  Holy mother  of pearl.  Speaking of that  wilding in Central Park,  it seems like  everyone's still  talking about it,  Anthony.  You know what  I find funny?  They're going to  the videotape  to try to figure  out who did  the crimes.  Yeah.  We can't figure  out if a guy  catches a goddamn  football when we  do instant replay  in the NFL,  and we're going  to use that  same technology 
[00:11:30]  to decide if  someone fondled  a girl or not.  Yeah.  Well, it all  depends on someone  ratting out someone  they know.  Yeah.  Like, they have  to see it on the  news and then go,  hey, wait a minute,  I know him.  Let me call the  police.  And I don't see  that happening,  you know?  Right.  And they can put  up all the  wanted posters  they want.  All I know is  whenever I walk  into a post office  and look at that  wanted wall,  looks like it did  when I walked  in there five  years ago.  I don't know.  And Howard Safer,  he's all over,  like, the news  stations going, 
[00:12:00]  you know,  if you were part  of the Central Park  Wilding,  we want you to  turn yourself in  because...  I think a few  did.  I know,  but he's saying  that and going,  because it's just  a matter of time  before we know  who you are  and we're coming  to get you.  Yeah.  That basically  means,  holy ass,  we don't have a  clue who did  what.  Yeah, yeah.  You better do it.  Oh, my God,  I hope they find it.  Why else would  you go on the  radio and say  that?  If you know  you're going to  catch him soon,  then why would  you have to  make an  announcement like  that?  But the whole  instant replay  technology to try  to figure out  who did the 
[00:12:30]  crimes is hilarious.  I know.  In the NFL,  they spend 20  minutes trying to  figure out if a  guy's foot is  inbounds when he  made the catch.  Now, you see,  he broke the  plane before the  knee hit the...  What?  Right.  What?  They can't work  that out, but  they're going to  use that same  technology to  determine someone's  guilt.  There was an  article in the  Post today,  one of the  guys that they  had pictured  pretty much on  the front page  of the Post  and all over  the Internet  because every  station in this  town has the  pictures of the  people they're  looking for. 
[00:13:00]  So he sees  his pictures  like, holy  S, yeah, I  was there.  He admitted he  was there, and  he says that he  was looking around  to see if he  could help any,  if he saw any  of the women he  knew that he  could possibly  help them.  Right.  And it turns out  he was flat out  innocent as could  be, but turned  himself in, ended  up spending 12  to 14 hours in  jail until they  cleared his name.  Yeah.  Oh.  And now he's  walking around  his neighborhood  trying to explain  himself because  they're all like,  yo, you're the  one on the 
[00:13:30]  front page of the  Post.  Dave from  Jersey, funny, I  don't remember  anyone rioting  after the Devils  won the Stanley  Cup.  Oh, that's  right.  There was  nobody at that  game.  Ouch.  It's everybody  calling Tony that  called up a  complete friggin'  idiot.  Yeah, that was  obvious.  Can't catch the  sarcasm.  Sometimes you're  not sure if we're  using sarcasm, but  I think that one  was very obvious.  Mike, what's  going on?  You're next on  N.E.W.  Yo, is Mad Dog  going to be  talking about  this today? 
[00:14:00]  The rioting?  The rioting.  Rioting, that's  what I said.  Mike and the  Mad Dog show, we're  going to go talking  about what kind of  sneakers are best  for rioting.  What was Kobe  wearing when he  was rioting?  Was that Kobe or  just someone wearing  a jersey?  We're going to  talk about the  best type of  sneak and  best grip to  push over a  news van.  I don't understand  why they couldn't  get it over.  You know, back  when they rioted  in Chicago, when  the Bulls won,  they were able to  push over those  news vans.  Will you shut 
[00:14:30]  up, dog?  I hate you.  Shut up.  We're going to  put a, we're  going to mark  in a barrel and  throw stuff on  him.  I need ratings.  I hate you,  dog.  We're working  together for a  11 years.  I can't stand  looking at you  another day.  Talking about the  pasting the Yankee  gave the Red Sox  last night at  Fenway, the  Green Monster.  No barrier for the  mighty bottom of the  Yankees. 
[00:15:00]  We'll be back  on the  green fence last  night for the  Yankees.  Oh my God, that  was hysterical.  Where's God?  Damn hysterical.  Get Psycho Mark in  here.  This is too good to  pass out.  This will be our  only sports break of  the day, by the  way.  It was so  friggin' funny.  Psycho Mark.  Mark's a huge Sox  fan.  Go to see the Sox!  22 to 1, right?  22 to 1.  2!  2!  22! 
[00:15:30]  Unbelievable.  They pelted them.  Everybody was  hitting.  Did you see  Steinbrenner at one  point got up to bat  and hit a home run  right out of Fenway.  Sox!  Go help yourself!  The Sox rule!  Mark for nothing.  All I have to say to  you is white Sox  last weekend.  Oh, please.  That's old news now.  Did you see Zim hit a  three-run homer right  out of the park when 
[00:16:00]  they put him up as a  goof?  He hit a homer when  they...  I thought it was just  his pacemaker he  coughed out.  He used his head to  hit a homer.  It was that easy last  night.  Now stepping up to  the plate, Joe  DiMaggio.  He's been dead.  They're wheeling his  coffin up to the  plate.  This looks like an  easy out for the Sox.  And the pitch.  Whoa!  A towering high  fly bus.  That one over.  Over Fenway.  Unbelievable.  Joe DiMaggio dead.  Knott's one out of  Fenway.  What are they doing  that way? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, Christopher Reeve  rolling up to the  plate.  The Yanks putting  Christopher Reeve in.  This, I don't see how  this can't be an out for  the Red Sox.  Oh, my God!  It's out of here!  Out of here!  We'll see tonight with  Pedro.  Oh, please.  Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we won so much!  Oh, we're only a  half a game behind!  Oh, we're only a half a game  behind!  Stephen Hawking, please  let me hit for the  Yankees.  Stephen Hawking, we're  rolling up to the  plate!  They're going to give  him a shot.  They're so far ahead 
[00:17:00]  right now.  Now, this is impossible.  I don't understand.  All you have to do is  lob it over the plate,  and you're striking  him out.  Ah!  It's out of here!  A three-run homer by the  completely paralyzed Stephen  Hawking!  Up next for the Yankees,  Don Imus.  Yeah, I'm going to swing a  bat at the ball, baby.  He can't even swing a  bat with five broken  ribs, but I think he did  last night.  Did you see my home run 
[00:17:30]  against the Sox?  Three-run homer, baby.  Yeah.  Right over the green  monster.  Yeah, baby!  Moby Worm coming to get  you!  That's the name of your  bat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up.  Shut up, Psycho Mark.  We have audio from the  game last night.  Din-din-din-din-din-din-din!  Din-din-din-din-din-din!  Din-din-din-din-din!  Din-din-din-din-din!  The Gas House  Gorillas!  Remember those guys?  He's a bug buddy.  He's a bug buddy.  All right, even though 
[00:18:00]  it's the Mets, could  you just pop this up?  I just love Red Sox  abuse.  I love Sox abuse.  Dude, you have to do  this to me.  You got it?  Yeah, hold on,  hold on.  All right.  Don't hit the wrong  switch there.  Go ahead.  So the winning run  is at second base  with two out,  three and two  to Mookie Wilson.  Little roller up along  first, behind the back!  Oh!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  And the Mets win it! 
[00:18:30]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Red Sox!  Not for nothing!  Can't be a salad!  So ladies and gentlemen,  up the bat for the  Yankees, King Gimp!  Ha ha ha!  King Gimp, I don't  understand, uh, this  has got to be an easy  out.  Oh my God, a three-run  homer for King Gimp  as he convulses around  the bases. 
[00:19:00]  22 to 1, the biggest  pasting in Red Sox  history.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,  dun!  What were they  doing, Mark?  Uh, you know, you're a Sox  fan, you know, what was the  mindset there?  What happened that they  could, uh, self-destruct so  badly?  They were, uh...  Did Mo Vaughn come back  to town and they went to a  strip club till 4 or 5 in the  morning?  Yeah, what, what, what, in  your opinion, what do you  think happened with the  Sox?  They effed the Sox.  It doesn't matter what  happened!  We kicked your ass! 
[00:19:30]  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  One, two, two.  Twenty two!  Two!  Two!  Two, two!  They were effing  the dog.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  You've gotta love it!  It's Mark from, uh,  Saudi, right?  Yeah.  Mark!  Born on H Street,  Mace,  on B Street!  Ah!  From what?  Southwest!  Hey!  Ah, Cassiapara!  We like him even though he's  11, you know why!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha! 
[00:20:00]  What happened to Nomad's bat?  Oh, it was a tragedy.  It's an effing tragedy.  There you go.  Look, he's got his big ghost socks, big hand.  He's a loser.  He's a fallen hand.  He's a loser.  That friggin' finger should just be put up someone's butt.  This is wicked awesome, this finger, all right?  It's wicked pisser.  You, Mr. Weir number one finger maker.  Even the Mets fans are laughing at you guys today.  Oh, yeah, we'll go after Mets. 
[00:20:30]  I still love Buckner.  He's still in my favor.  John, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Doing well.  I wanted to, do you guys know why the Red Sox are like lawn furniture?  Why?  Because you fold them up and put them away at the end of summer.  Hey, that's good.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  That's good.  Lewis, what's going on?  Yeah, dudes, I can't believe this guy's cheering for those loser Red Sox.  Shucks!  Red Sox!  Listen, I think they took a bigger raping than those women at Central Park last week, last night. 
[00:21:00]  Good God almighty.  Yeah, they enjoyed it too!  Yeah, they got it up deep.  Wah, wah, wah.  All right, Lewis.  Take care, dudes.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Those Sox.  New York checking in again.  This is for Psycho Mark.  Hey, Mark, look what I did to you again.  Oh, Gandhi!  Pedro's pitching tonight, you see sucking!  Wow, we might only get ten runs. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Troy from Jersey.  I hear that Christopher Reeves even hit one out.  He just blew into the little straw and it swung the bat for him.  Yeah.  You know, it was a pretty touching moment in last night's game when Joe Torre went to  the plate and hit a home run out of Fenway with his colon.  With just a piece of his colon.  And that ball flew.  Right.  I think it hit Lansdowne. 
[00:22:00]  Amazing.  Vinny from Rosedale.  Those were hits?  I thought Knobloch was throwing a first every time the ball left the park.  Yeah.  Well, we got that problem to deal with.  Ooh-hoo-hoo!  Yeah, how about Gina throwing that hammer?  Huh?  That was real good!  Oh, wow.  You still got one run last night.  I know.  And 22 for the Yankees.  Matt from Westchester.  The Yankees better conduct a massive checkup of all their players.  After last night's performance, they probably all have huge tumors, according to Spaz. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Play Buckner.  Someone wants to hear the Buckner again.  Oh, we love the Buckner.  Well, not enough!  Who doesn't?  I think Buckner's got more fans in New York than he has.  So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson.  Little roller up along first.  Behind the bag!  It gets through Buckner!  Oh! 
[00:23:00]  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha 
[00:23:30]  Harry Caray.  I'm about Harry Caray with his big, thick glasses.  It's out of here.  Hitting it with a hot dog.  I thought Bill Rizzuno was there, too, last night.  Look at this.  A classic day for Yankee baseball.  Taking the plate now, it's Thurman Munson.  Thurman. 
[00:24:00]  How much of a make it find?  This has to be an easy out for the Sox.  This is going to pretty much wrap it up.  Oh, it's out of here.  It's out of here.  They ran out of little numbers to put up in the green monster.  Did they have to turn over a five to make another two?  Is that what they did over there, the green monster?  Some guy in there.  Where's my other two card?  I can't find it.  When do we let you get an electric scab on?  I can't find another two card, damn it.  Two. 
[00:24:30]  Nineteen, eighteen.  Oh.  Nineteen, eighteen.  It's so much fun.  We love the Sox.  Yeah, Mark, you do remember the last time Pettit faced Pedro, right?  You do remember, right?  Yeah, how did that one end?  Two-one yank.  There we go.  At least we get to drink beer in the bleachers.  Well, finally, Mark brings up a valid point.  That is a valid point. 
[00:25:00]  I've got to give you that.  That's all you have to say to go heck yourselves.  Slots rule.  Oh, Fagway Park.  It's a green monster.  Ah, classic.  Oh, God.  Next up, Tony Soprano's mother.  Oh, come on.  Now you've got you, Mark.  Chris, what's going on? 
[00:25:30]  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  I heard that even Darryl Strawberry's dealer had a home run last night.  Yeah, that's true.  That was, I believe, in the seventh inning.  Darryl Strawberry's coat dealer got up and just slammed it.  Got a huge piece of that ball.  Oh, he killed it.  And also followed up by two runs from his whores that he got down in Florida.  Remember those two crack whores that he picked up?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was a great day.  Great day for the Yanks. 
[00:26:00]  We've got to take a break.  So much more to do.  A lot of people on hold.  We're talking about the Central Park Wilding.  We're talking about the rioting in L.A. after the Lakers' victory.  Billy Martin's head in the sixth inning had to be the highlight when he clinched the bat in his teeth  and swung for the Green Monster.  And it went over.  Jesus.  It was amazing.  That's wrong.  All right, we'll take a break.  2-1-2, 7-5-7, 1-0-2-7.  Fran is 84 years old. 
[00:26:30]  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No, anal is okay.  Train Wreck Radio.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7, WNEW.  Anthony Mujan.  Yes, Mujan.  We just met a couple of people from Mujan.  Yes.  They did a little impromptu demonstration.  My God.  They had this hairy guy.  He comes into our office and he wants to show us how well this Mujan thing works.  And he's ripping off, you know, strips of the Mujan. 
[00:27:00]  And he wasn't feeling any pain.  I think we should tell people that it was from the back of his hand.  Yeah.  From the back of his hand.  Yeah.  But I have a feeling if he took his shirt off, he'd have a sweater under there.  Yes, Mujan.  Come on.  What are you waiting for?  You got a big puffy thing in your panties?  You go to the beach with a bikini and it just looks like Larry Fine from the Three Stooges. 
[00:27:30]  Well, yes.  Oh.  Well, I mean, the people at Mujan have made it really easy to wax.  I guess in the old days, I don't know, the ladies had to go to like a salon or something.  A salon.  And you know what it was?  It was embarrassing.  They had to, you know, put their legs up in stirrups and stuff and then they would wax it and rip it off.  Yeah.  And it would hurt and blah, blah, blah.  Mm-hmm.  Well, the people at Mujan made it easy.  They got these new strips now.  Yeah, they're strips.  You just take them right out.  There's no preparation.  Like some of these waxing things, you have to melt wax. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And smear it on.  It's a big mess.  These come in strips.  You just take them out of the box and they're ready to use.  You rub them on.  Give a little rub.  Peel it off.  The hair comes out completely.  It grows back finer and less often.  And it leaves your skin really smooth.  It's the best way to get rid of unwanted hair.  It's the Mujan 2000.  The strips, Opie.  Yeah.  Mm.  Great for the bikini line.  And everywhere you want to get rid of unwanted hair.  You got that little mustache going there, ladies? 
[00:28:30]  Come on.  We've seen them.  Yeah, they got Mujan strips for the face.  For the face.  For the mustache.  Even trim up those eyebrows with the Mujan.  But, you know, ladies, if you look in the mirror and you think you have a mustache but  you're not sure, you do.  And you got to get rid of it because the guys notice.  They really do.  So, Mujan is the best way to get rid of it.  Won't leave a rash.  It's not like shaving.  Oh, my God.  Speaking of hair, Anthony.  Yes.  I don't get this.  Maybe you could explain this to me.  Sure.  I've seen it a lot lately.  I saw it on the subway.  I saw it at the bagel store over the weekend. 
[00:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know those people that have, like, moles on their face?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yes.  They seem to be from, like, some Romania or Russia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seems that something's going on in those countries.  They get more of a boils on their face than the average person.  Yes.  Those big moles.  I don't understand.  You get the mole or the boil on your face and then they feel like they have to let the  hair grow out of the boil or the mole?  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Why can't you trim the hair?  Is that going to cause cancer? 
[00:29:30]  Could someone explain that to me?  Opie, use Mujan.  I was ordering a bagel in Huntington.  And I was deeply disturbed because this lady had a huge boil and hair like this far out in.  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  I don't know.  Mujan, your big Romanian moles.  Mujan it.  Aaron Neville, Mujan, the big thing on your head.  Too bad they can't come up with a really good product and just get rid of that mole on Aaron Neville's head.  That's called a Black & Decker power sander. 
[00:30:00]  That'll do it.  All right.  Mujan.  It's great.  It is the way to remove unwanted hair without irritating your skin.  Leaves it smooth.  Hypoallergenic.  This is the way to go.  Mujan.  Available at Dwayne Reed.  Harmon Cosmetics.  Genevieve's Drugs and Cosmetics.  Plus, if you don't see Mujan, ask the store manager to bring it in.  Mujan.  This is your announcer, Hugh Mungus Becker, saying,  Boatty, Boatty, Boatty, Boatty, Boatty, Boatty, Boatty, Boatty, Boatty, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  We're obnoxious little assholes. 
[00:30:30]  1027 WNEW.  Lots of instant feedback coming in about the Yankee victory last night in Boston, Anthony.  Yes.  Mickey Mantle's liver checking in.  I homered and then had a few cold ones in the bleachers.  All right, Mick.  Rob from Brooklyn checking in.  That score was higher than Billy Martin's final blood alcohol content.  God, that's awful.  The other high-profile radio shows, they need to hire comedy writers. 
[00:31:00]  We don't need to do that.  We got our listeners, man.  Yeah, why bother?  212-757-1027.  Anthony.  Yes.  Today, we get back to the normal Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, we do.  We've been torturing women lately.  That was kind of fun, though.  It really was.  Yeah, we're going to play some more clips from the 55-gallon drum challenge in a little while.  I was listening back to some of it, and I was definitely enjoying myself just a tad too much. 
[00:31:30]  Yes, you were, Andy.  Just a little too much.  It looked like you were getting out a little revenge.  No.  I don't think so.  Well, Steve has started putting up the video clips on FoundryMusic.com.  The screams.  See, I thought the still pictures told the story.  No, the video's great.  The video clips that are on FoundryMusic.com.  And he's got it set up where you don't even have to download the video clips from the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Dreaming media.  So, you've got to go to FoundryMusic.com. 
[00:32:00]  The funniest is watching Tabitha get into her barrel.  She's all smiling.  She's going down into the barrel, like, giggling.  And she starts, like, fiddling with her pigtails that she had.  And she gets in the barrel, and Big Kevin just slaps the top on the loxer amp.  Yeah.  And then you go to the video of her afterwards.  Drown rat.  It's like she just...  Gone through the war.  And she is in, like, no mood.  No.  No more giggling.  No fun.  No.  We're going to hear from a few more of the contestants today. 
[00:32:30]  We've got to hear from Tabitha and Christian.  I think we've heard from all of them, right?  Darryl Strawberry hit a home run because he was swinging at eight balls last night, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  That coming in.  Let's go to the phones.  Talk to Mark online, too.  Mark, what's going on, man?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Not bad.  Went to Fenway this past weekend.  Yeah.  Sported my Yankee jersey, of course.  Yes.  And noticed there were no black people.  What, at Fenway?  None.  None.  No, it's a very divided city, Boston. 
[00:33:00]  Well, I don't know about you guys, but I ain't seen black people in Boston.  It's very divided.  If you go to Chelsea or Dorchester.  I don't know.  Roxbury.  Roxbury.  Yeah, but you don't see many black people at the Knick games.  I don't know, yo, but listen, Fenway, dude, it's got a really, like, I don't know.  I love Yankees.  I love my Yankee fans.  I love my Yankee stadium.  But there's a presence at Fenway.  I mean, it's like seeing the Green Monster, even though it's not that tall, but it's like,  it's totally different baseball. 
[00:33:30]  You're sitting in seats that people sat to watch Babe Ruth.  That's pretty wild.  Yeah.  Nurse the curse, and I want to play what's in my pants.  No.  We don't play what you got.  Size?  Oh, come on.  I want to put what's on my chin.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  A hairy sack.  Yeah.  On your chin.  Hey, Mary, you're up.  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to say that on Friday, I was driving around, and I saw it in Rochelle  Toyota.  You guys had a wow sticker stuff.  Yes.  And I just wanted to say that it was the first time that I wowed somebody. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, cool.  And how did it go for you?  Yeah, it was good.  It was awesome.  Awesome.  And yesterday, I was driving on the Tappan Z, and I saw somebody made their own window  display of the wow sticker.  It said wow, and then it said, oops, I did it to you again.  Hey, nice.  That's pretty good.  Yeah, it was awesome.  We still love seeing the homemade wow signs, even though we have the stickers out there now,  but I love the creativity a lot of the listeners come up with.  Yeah, they made it themselves and everything.  Cool.  A lot of construction sites in Manhattan have wow on them now. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  I'm noticing.  Uh-huh.  Thank you, guys.  Ah!  Oh, oh, oh.  Construction?  Is that cervic construction?  I'll slap an injunction on him so quick, it'll make his head spin.  You just wanted to play that horn so mad.  And it's got a new sound, and now I'm working it for the show.  It means it.  But this whole place sucks.  That's right, it sucks.  God damn. 
[00:35:00]  I got a new sound, too.  Survivor.  Survivor.  Survivor, right.  You're hypocrites.  You spent several days talking about black, Hispanic animals that went wilding and the black Hispanics that talked during the movies,  but you spent five minutes talking about white rioters in L.A.  No, I said that a large percentage of them were white.  There were blacks in there.  Don't worry.  We were all working as a team, black and white, to riot and destroy L.A. together. 
[00:35:30]  That's it.  What, you want us to go a half hour on that?  We would have spent more time on the riots after the Lakers championship, but see, I mean, you know.  It's L.A., who cares?  And besides that, you know, we'd look at the phones and see if you guys want to continue talking about something.  I think the Central Park Wilding was a huge story for everyone.  And it was in New York, and we're in New York, so we were talking about it.  Why, would you also like us to go and talk about black crime in L.A.?  We'll get on that for a while.  That might take a few hours.  Goddamn Mexicans. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, enough.  I'm into the healing now, Opie.  I'm into the healing portion.  How cute.  I want closure.  Any more psychobabble words I could come out with?  Closure and healing.  There's a big wow on 7th Avenue and 49th Street.  Thank you, guys.  Oh, yeah?  That's what I'm hearing.  On a construction site.  Slap an injunction on him so quick it'll make his head spin. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, Linda, what's going on?  Linda.  Yes.  What's up?  Not too much.  NYPD?  Yes, I am.  Very good.  Cop chick.  Yeah.  Cop chicks are hot.  Yeah.  What's up, cop chicks?  Not too much.  I was listening to your 55-gallon drum challenge.  I tried to get through because I wanted to be a contestant.  You did?  Yes, but I couldn't get through, but I give those girls a lot of credit.  Well, you've got to give them credit.  Yeah, that was something.  I was surprised they were able to go through with it.  I'm telling you. 
[00:37:00]  Are you one of those hot chick cops?  I don't see many of them.  I love the ladies out there that are on the NYPD, but I've seen a few hot ones.  Well, those are the ones I noticed when you're driving around and you look in the patrol car  and you just see like a blonde ponytail or something.  Whoa, wow.  Look at that.  There's a few around Yankee Stadium.  Yeah?  Well, somewhere I work, too.  Huh?  Somewhere I work, too.  Yeah?  How long have you been on the force? 
[00:37:30]  Quite some time now.  About 12 years?  Yeah, huh?  Uh-huh.  Do anything kinky with that nightstick ever?  No.  Bring any guys home and, yeah.  No.  You take that nightstick.  You guys rule.  All right, Linda.  Come on.  Easy.  We're going to play another clip from, well, is that where we left off yesterday?  Uh, yeah, but we're still.  All right.  Because we have Tabitha on the line as well.  You know, there's a lot of phrases from the show being used in the media now, Opie. 
[00:38:00]  Hey, have you noticed that?  Well, we get a lot of email.  Go ahead.  Somebody sent me something this morning from Reuters, the news agency, talking about Wall  Street and how it just really hasn't rallied or come back since the big fall and the end  of the winter.  And the article starts, torture.  It's torture.  No way.  Torture.  It's torture.  Torture.  And then it goes on to say how Wall Street's just tortured by the market slump. 
[00:38:30]  But the guy was like, yeah, look at that.  You're working your way into the media.  A lot of people in the media use the term junk, I noticed, too.  Junk.  Okay, terrific is really catching on.  A lot of people just when they don't know what to say.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Sam, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just said the ECW show in Danbury, Connecticut, and Mikey Whipwreck and Sal Graziano. 
[00:39:00]  Both of them guys were running around before and after and during the show.  Okay, terrific.  And I'm over here now a lot.  Really?  I'm over here now.  That's good.  Yeah, you guys are in there with a lot of wow signs in the audience.  Yeah, ECW loves the O&A show.  What can I tell you?  Cool.  Just don't bring the O&A signs to the WCW crap.  Oh, God.  They suck, man.  You guys rule.  All right, thank you.  Is that WCW just the worst?  I can't stay on it for... 
[00:39:30]  When WWF is in commercials, sometimes you switch over.  Yeah.  And it's just like, oh.  It's like fake wrestling.  It's bad.  There's such a thing.  Just old men doing bad leg drops.  Yeah.  You know, and the crowd just isn't as into it.  The Hulk Hogan leg drop.  My God.  The WWF event is like, we're here live from Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  And the crowd's just going wild.  And you switch over there and they're just sitting in their seats watching a bunch.  Hey, look.  I'm the Hulkster. 
[00:40:00]  I'm going to do a leg drop off the first rope.  Wow.  That's amazing.  Or the clothesline.  Oh, yeah.  And they actually do the old wrestling holds.  Yeah.  All the old holds.  Remember the old wrestling matches?  They would always start with that wrestling hold.  Yeah.  They grab each other's shoulders.  Or they put their hands out for the strength challenge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They grip interlock hands.  Oh, God.  Meanwhile, you switch over to WWF and the Hardy Boys are like falling off the roof of the place  or something.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  It's a lot more to watch.  Without a doubt.  It's a sleeper hold.  Not a hold.  I just really got to go to sleep.  The WCW can't get into any of the big arenas.  That's one reason.  So.  Sucks.  All right.  Anthony, we do have to take a break.  We have Tabitha, one of the contestants from the 55 Gallon Drum Challenge, standing by to  talk to us, Anthony.  And I believe we can play another clip from the 55 Gallon Drum Challenge.  If you want to see the video clips, go to foundrymusic.com.  Steve said there's so much material to go through.  He's going to be putting up new clips throughout the whole week. 
[00:41:00]  Cool.  As we go to spots here, Jack from Long Island, I see you guys made the paper today.  How did it sit with the boss?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, we made page three of the post again.  I need my bedpan and the green jello, please.  Yeah, baby.  Seems like other air personnel is a little jealous.  Ouch.  That we made the paper today. 
[00:41:30]  See, in the old days, it was just one person's name in the paper when something wacky happened  in the city.  Now it's like, hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two a-holes.  Hello.  We need attention, too.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  And it just pisses him off to no end.  Oh, it sure does.  That we're getting any type of attention in this town.  I think he's more pissed because our lines were much funnier than his in the paper today. 
[00:42:00]  Someone's got to say it.  Yeah.  It's too funny.  It just must just burn his ass.  It's horrible.  It's like in the old days, it was just, you know, if I miss fell off a horse and hurt himself,  that was it.  Oh, let's, let's, uh, let's get a comment.  From his, uh, arch rival.  Yeah.  Now it's like, you know, halfway down the article, hey, look who showed up here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  It's Opie and A-hole. 
[00:42:30]  You had some hilarious lines in the paper today.  Oh, when I open up the paper and I have to read a quote that came out of my mouth,  I was saved by my big fag cowboy hat.  You know, it's one thing saying it, but then when I read it, I'm just like, where's my life gone?  No, I'm quoted in the paper as saying big fag cowboy hat.  The line about hitting the ground with his face, though.  God damn.  How did that line exactly go?  If, uh, my face hit the ground, I would have hurt the ground. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, baby.  Moby Worm.  I'm, uh, gonna do a Hargis bit.  I used to say stuff like that all the time, but now it's printed in the paper.  Big fag cowboy hat.  Saved my life, baby.  Like a crash helmet.  Big gay fag homo cowboy hat.  Yeah, baby.  Reverend Billy Saul Hargis saved me.  I don't care if a ranger freezes long enough to have my plastic Jesus riding on the dashboard of my car.  Reverend Billy Saul Hargis and my big fag cowboy hat saved me. 
[00:43:30]  On F.A.  He tripped over Moby Worm, it looks like, huh?  Moby Worm.  My horse tripped over Moby Worm, baby.  I'm doing the Imus from the 70s and 80s, ain't I?  Not like, uh, this Imus, bud.  No.  Shut up, bud.  The old Imus was like, oh, yeah, Billy Saul Hargis.  Yeah, we got the 10,000 hamburger bit.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, Moby Worm coming to your high school.  Oh, did I bring that in?  What, that bad Imus? 
[00:44:00]  In honor of Mr. Imus, I got his, uh, his CD.  Oh, it's in your bag?  Oh, that's great.  It's not in my bag.  Since Mr. Imus.  It might be in office stuff.  Since Mr. Imus can't be live on the air, we might as well play some Mr. Imus.  Oh, man.  It was really bad.  I hope our CD, Dometta World, holds up to the test of time, because Mr. Imus' CD did not hold up to the test of time.  Baby!  Yeah.  Oh, shut up, Bernard.  I think he was trying to fight, uh, from getting that damn thing re-released. 
[00:44:30]  That's what I was trying to do.  Uh, get my horse to step on a copy of one of my CDs, and, uh, he tripped.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, my face didn't, uh, hold up too well to the test of time, either.  Yeah, baby.  Kind of sinking, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Uh, they're saying the, uh, saddle on the, uh, horse was, uh, too tight.  And, uh, he bucked me off.  Buck and Bronco, baby!  Ho, ho!  Moby Worm coming to get you.  Coming to your high school.  It's the Buck and Bronco Imus coming down the street. 
[00:45:00]  Look out.  Worse than Moby Worm.  It might fall on your, fall on your head, baby.  I'm the Throne Ranger.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, boy.  Goddamn.  Yeah.  We're always in trouble.  Rob from Brooklyn.  You guys are getting into the mainstream media.  Last night, Hugh Downs in 2020 told Barbara Walters to kiss his chocolate star face.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And funny, she did.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:45:30]  That's funny.  Very good.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I don't know.  Did the boss yell at us for that one?  No.  Not yet.  All right.  Why don't we play a clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge?  We're getting to the good clip, slowly but surely, here.  And when we get back from break, we'll talk to Tabitha, one of the contestants.  Okay, Anthony?  Yeah, baby.  I don't even know where we're picking up the 55-gallon drum challenge.  I guess we'll just figure it out together, here.  It's a quick clip, and we'll be back.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus. 
[00:46:00]  I have a strong stomach.  You guys make me blow trucks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Oh, and they're my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Hopefully you're going to dance with me.  What a couple of ass-wives.  1027.  WNEW.  The Lesbian Ice Cream Girls have arrived, Anthony.  They're setting up outside the studio.  Yes, Lesbian Ice Cream Girls.  You've got to love it.  We're going to throw on the spaz cam for that in a little while. 
[00:46:30]  They're always a lot of fun when they stop by the program, Ant.  Yes.  Also, I don't want anyone confused out there.  We don't hate Imus.  No.  I guess certain people in the media like to twist it like, we hate Imus, too, or something.  And that's not true at all.  We don't know Imus.  Yeah.  But the guy has been in New York for many years.  He's a public figure, a celebrity in this town.  And when something happens to him, what, we're not supposed to talk about him?  Eat me. 
[00:47:00]  Someone is confusing the issue.  Absolutely.  We never said we didn't like Imus.  We like him because the guy seems to have a sense of humor.  It's our job to make fun of Imus if he falls off a damn horse.  Trust me.  He's talked about us and stuff that we've done.  And we talk about him.  And the cool thing about Imus is that he could take a joke.  Right.  We have heard from his camp that he could take a joke.  It finds Ant's impression quite funny.  Contrary to other people that cannot take a joke. 
[00:47:30]  Contrary to what comes across on his program, he does have a sense of humor.  Well, let's not confuse the issue.  We don't hate Imus.  No.  It has nothing to do with that.  Yeah.  Some body was trying to confuse the issue.  Like, why do we hate Imus?  Why would we talk about Imus?  And why do we hate Imus?  We don't have a history with Imus, Opie.  So why would we get on?  We're not getting on the air and saying we hate Imus.  We're doing parody of Imus.  See, we're doing a character. 
[00:48:00]  We do a character of Mr. Imus.  You see?  That doesn't mean we're making fun of him.  We're not being vindictive and hateful of Mr. Imus.  We don't care.  I don't know the guy from A Hole in the Wall, except for what I see on the TV show that he has in the morning and on the radio.  Which is on too early for me, and I'm not up until noon.  But other than that, I don't know him.  We don't know him.  So, you know, people try to confuse the issue, though, because it's not, you know, you read your name in the paper and stuff, 
[00:48:30]  and you think you're going to read the rest of the article, and it's just going to be about what you said.  And all of a sudden, Opie and Anthony are in there.  It's like, oh, Jesus.  That's got to piss off some people.  Oh, these two idiots.  What am I going to do?  You know, like the mosquito that's caught in your room at night, and it keeps going by your ear.  Like, oh, goddamn mosquito.  And it goes away, and you think, all right, it'll never find my ear again.  This room is huge.  It's a little mosquito.  You're just starting to doze off. 
[00:49:00]  Do you hate that?  The giant went either worse.  And you're going to need a really big fly swatter to get rid of that mosquito.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  All right, Anthony, why don't we talk to Tabitha, one of the contestants from the 55-gallon drum challenge from Friday.  Tabitha.  By the way, foundrymusic.com, just getting counted.  We got video clips from the 55-gallon drum challenge up there,  and you might want to try the video clips later on today.  Because Steve is just putting up a ton. 
[00:49:30]  He's going to spend the rest of the week putting up new clips there.  So, I mean, it just makes the whole thing that much more interesting to see the video.  Yeah, baby.  Girls in the drums.  Tabitha.  Tabitha.  Yeah, hey.  Oh, you sound much better today.  How are you?  Oh, yeah.  I'm 100% better today.  And why don't you tell everyone about Tabitha, how she started the contest, how she ended the contest.  Tabitha came in.  A lot of the guys, very surprised.  She was a very attractive girl.  I'm wearing little braid pigtails of blonde hair. 
[00:50:00]  Nice figure.  Very cute face.  Nice girl.  And she came in all smiles and everything and thought this was going to be a piece of cake, pretty much.  She even dressed for the occasion.  She went in the barrel with a fine piece of lingerie.  A little piece of lingerie.  And she gets in there.  The top gets slapped down.  Fast forward a few hours later of abuse and things being dumped on her.  She was horrified and almost in tears.  She had to meditate in the barrel to keep from freaking out. 
[00:50:30]  And at the beginning of the competition, she was throwing stuff back out at us, which just made us put more stuff in her barrel than anyone else's.  That was a total mistake.  That was another thing, too.  You know what it was?  You being, I think you were the guy's favorite.  I've got to say that.  So a lot of the guys, like the girl in the playground that gets picked on the most when you like the girl.  Yeah, that was definitely me.  All the guys were throwing stuff in your barrel to try to get your attention.  Meanwhile, you were just sitting there with your eyes shut, almost in tears. 
[00:51:00]  Well, I couldn't recognize anyone except from the waist down, so that was useless.  Yeah, we still had our junk out.  We had enough holes in the side of the barrel.  Yeah.  But we broke you down pretty good, I must say.  You left here a little frazzled.  Yeah, I was definitely...  And your husband, your husband was here for the festivities.  He was pretty pissed off.  He was ready to punch Joe Soprano in the face.  I think he was ready to hit it at night, too, at one point.  No, he was cool with it. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, I think he just kind of, it got to him after a while.  Well, yeah, we're abusing his wife right in front of him.  Yeah, but whenever he came over and, like, checked on me, I was still smiling for the most part until the very end.  And then it was just, I mean, I was really almost at my wit's end there.  And if it had gone on too much longer, I would have gotten out.  Really?  Absolutely.  I mean, it was so disgusting in those barrels.  I don't think people can really picture what it was like being on the inside of that thing. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, it was like, if you ever see a movie where people have to, like, go down into the sewers, it was like that.  I mean, it was just so nasty and it was so claustrophobic and creepy.  And really dark.  Yeah.  And the smell was just, oh, God.  The smell was just, I mean, it was worse than anything I've ever experienced.  Yeah.  Now, what was the worst part for you when you were in that barrel?  You know, I guess probably the bugs.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was the ones the girls really freaked out at, the crickets and then the mealworms and then the huge hissing cockroaches. 
[00:52:30]  Mostly because that was at the end and it was like we were all just getting fed up with it.  And, you know, that was just like the icing on the cake.  It was awful.  Yeah.  And we ran out of stuff to throw in the barrel.  You guys made it through the hissing cockroaches.  We're like, what else can we throw in there?  Yeah, we thought we were at least going to lose one more years after that.  But we had an extra rat laying around for the rat eating.  Well, you would have lost me if you put that in there.  That's for sure.  What did your cleaning ritual, your hygiene, when you got home? 
[00:53:00]  I'm still in the tub for Friday.  I'm looking at the picture of you on NEW.com of you getting out of the barrel.  There's just bugs all over your fine lingerie and all over your body and bugs in your cleavage.  I took like a really hot soapy bath for like two hours.  You know, I've washed my hair about 40 times.  Wait, did you shower first?  Yeah.  Because that's kind of gross to just get in a tub first because all that crap would be floating around in the tub. 
[00:53:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  I scraped off the first few layers of that.  Did you find anything in your kiki?  No, everything was just fine.  Everything is fine.  It's like a gasket down there.  Everything is fresh as a daisy now.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I mean, all I remember is you walking from the studio to the bathroom to get cleaned up with the towel around you.  Yeah.  And your face looked pained.  Oh, God.  And your hair was just a different color.  It was like a...  You know, I think it's because it smelled worse outside of the barrel than it did inside the barrel. 
[00:54:00]  It certainly did.  I mean, you guys dumped like two gallons of tomato juice into the drums before you put all the fish guts.  And that's the only thing that neutralizes that fish smell.  Hey, you know, they use that for skunk, tomato juice.  You take a bath in tomato juice.  That's right.  We didn't think about that.  We didn't have this figured out.  I mean, we had the sour milk.  That was pretty bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, trust me, the smell was terrible.  But it's just, I think the chum smell was worse in the studio than it was in the barrel. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  I don't think our listeners fully understand this contest yet.  I mean, we had the sour milk where it was just clumps.  It was out all day on a radiator.  And we were pouring it right on the girl's head.  It was just clumps on their head of sour milk and cream and everything else.  It was so disgusting.  And this is just so totally out of character for me.  I mean, I have like a really conservative job on Wall Street.  You know, my friends, my family, they're just totally appalled.  They're appalled? 
[00:55:00]  They're appalled.  I mean, it's hysterical.  That is pretty funny.  All right.  Now, did you have any nightmares?  A lot of the contestants we've talked to so far, they had nightmares over the weekend.  Yeah, I did, actually.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  I've had some nightmares.  You know, I mean, it's starting to wear off.  Like right now, it doesn't really bother me anymore.  But the next day, you know, because I was tired.  I was kind of short on sleep.  We went out that night.  And I just, you know, when I finally went home and crashed, I just, I woke up like ten times in the night dreaming that I was still in that barrel. 
[00:55:30]  It was like things getting dumped on me much worse than what you were dumping on me.  Yeah, it was pretty creepy.  See, we don't do wacky radio here where we have a bunch of contestants.  They have to touch a car.  Last person touching the car gets it.  Yeah.  Who cares?  We actually make you go home horrified.  Yes.  We break you down.  No, but it was worth it just to see if I could do it.  And you did.  Yeah.  You made it all the way to the end.  One of the three that made it to the end.  Yeah.  Two out of the five bailed during the bug segment. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  That was a little rough.  Little rough.  And I was definitely on the edge.  Yeah.  Well, Tabitha, you're going to have to come to the next road show because you're going to be a hero.  Okay.  No more bugs, though, right?  No, no, no.  We'll treat you like a princess.  Our listeners will treat you with the utmost respect.  Tabitha?  Yeah.  Would you like to do one more thing for us?  Yeah.  Can we play Guess What's in Tabitha's Pan?  What's right now? 
[00:56:30]  I had a feeling that was coming.  Yeah.  Well, I'll tell you what.  I'm in my office, but that probably makes it that much better, huh?  Now it's very hot.  And now there's no choice.  Now you have to play.  I'll do it.  All right.  We'll give you some Mujan.  When have I ever turned you guys down?  We'll give you some Mujan.  Right.  All contestants of What's in My Pants get Mujan for now on.  Yes.  The official sponsor, Guess What's in My Pants, Mujan.  Mujan.  All right.  You want to play?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, all right.  Ed, you've got the pen pen work. 
[00:57:00]  Pen pen.  Very good.  Just give me the rules here.  I'm not an expert on this.  Okay.  The rules are you take the phone that you're on.  Okay.  You rub it on your most intimate of areas.  Right.  Up and down, side to side, and then a circular motion.  Okay.  And then Opie and I will guess what type of hair style you're sporting in your lap.  And you don't mention it.  You don't give us any hints or clues or tell us until we have given our response and ask you for the answer.  Okay.  I just got to close the shade here.  You know what I'm like in a really public place. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, you do.  Close the shade.  And what are you wearing right now?  I'm wearing a business suit.  Business suit?  Yeah.  I've got sort of a little librarian look going on.  Ah.  All right.  You're going to be able to get that, you know, your pants down and stuff?  Well, I'm not really wearing anything that would get in the way, so.  Ah.  What do you got, like a little skirt thing on?  Yeah.  And then underneath, what type of panties are you wearing?  None.  Okay.  Hold on.  Don't say where.  Let us all just bask in that for a minute.  Just for a minute.  Did you go to work like this?  Yeah, I always do. 
[00:58:00]  You don't wear panties, do you?  No, I'm wearing stockings.  Stockings.  Oh, okay.  But sometimes I just wear the thigh highs.  All right.  Hold on.  So it's going to be easy?  Yeah.  No problem.  Okay.  So it's going to be easy for you.  Oh, wait a minute.  You guys still there?  You're going to be able to take the phone with me.  Hold it.  Hold on.  So now you've got stockings for the phone.  I'm having a hard time with this.  There's no blood in our heads anymore. 
[00:58:30]  Vagina.  Yes.  So you're going to be able to take the phone and pull the stockings away and get it on Bear,  whatever you have down there.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Terrific.  Should I just go ahead and go?  No.  Oh, we need the theme song.  Theme song coming up here.  Very haunting.  People really like this damn thing.  Vagina  Vagina  Hey guess what's in my bag 
[00:59:00]  Budsick  Vagina  Vagina  Hey guess what's in my bag  Budsick  Pussar  Pussar  Pussar  Alright ready  Yeah, we're ready on this end.  Okay.  Give a little rub up and down.  Up and down first.  Up and down.  Yes. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  Okay.  That's good.  Now, side to side, if you would, slowly.  Okay.  Got it?  Yes.  Now, a slow, circular motion.  Okay.  Hold on.  Huzzah!  Yeah.  Huzzah!  Was that enough for you there, boy?  Yeah.  That was very telling.  I need side to side one more time.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Hang on a second. 
[01:00:00]  There's people walking by.  Just give me a minute.  Yeah.  You have all the time you need.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I need just about a minute.  Got it?  Got it, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Opie, I am going to say...  Now, remember, don't reveal what you have until we ask you.  Okay.  Opie, I am going to say she has a natural, well-kept triangle.  Yeah, I was going to do the same.  Are you saying that?  Yeah.  You could still take that.  No, I got to go with that, too.  This is the first time we're agreeing on this.  We're actually agreeing. 
[01:00:30]  Tabitha, if you would tell us, what is in your pants?  All right.  It's somewhere between a hardwood floor and sort of like a real, real short crew cut.  So it's just a trimmed triangle.  Very, very short.  And it's also, by the way, I'm a natural blonde.  Yes.  Yes.  So I think you guys can get that one.  Opie, Opie, Opie.  We definitely won.  Opie, Opie.  We've given you enough stuff, but now hold on a line.  We're going to give you some Moujahn.  Some Moujahn. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, great.  Opie, Opie.  Yes.  By the way, guys, we have like three hours of video, mostly of Anthony just getting a total buzz from pouring stuff on us.  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  I was enjoying it much too much.  Yeah.  I mean, it looked like a lot more fun from the outside than from the inside.  Let's put it that way.  It was.  Well, if we ever do this again, we're going to invite you girls down, and you could abuse whoever's in the...  Suite.  Yeah, in the barrels.  All right, Tabitha, thanks for playing What's In My Pants. 
[01:01:30]  Thanks for being a contestant in the 55-gallon drum challenge.  No problem.  And look at that.  RJ from Jersey got it wrong.  He guessed you had a hissing cockroach in your pants.  Not anymore.  All right, hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  There she goes, the lovely Tabitha from the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony.  That was pretty good.  Coming to the table to play Guess What's In My Pants.  I didn't think you were going to be able to pull that one off.  Pimp-panned, Opie.  Pimp-panned.  Let's go to Jay on line seven.  Jay, what's going on? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, I heard somebody stealing your bit the other day on the air.  The DJ was playing Guess What's In My Pants.  It was, I think, Zoo 100.  Guess What's In My Pants, but please, please only men call.  Okay?  Zoo 100.  Penises.  It was either that or KC 101.  They were playing like Britney Spears and stuff, so I don't really know.  It was playing in a shopping center when I heard it.  The funny thing is every call was,  Um, what's wrong?  That's it.  Nothing's going in yet. 
[01:02:30]  All right, Jay.  What's wrong?  I'm called.  Thank you, Jay.  All right, see you guys.  Bye.  All right, Ant, as we go to break,  why don't we play another clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge?  Ah, okay.  We found Mr. Imus' CD, Anthony.  Yeah.  1,200 hamburgers, baby.  That's what the CD's called.  We must play the title track next.  Some of the comedy stylings of the I-man, Imus.  In his heyday, back in the 70s and 80s,  baby, when I was up, Imus, 
[01:03:00]  doing the Hargis bits  and talking about Moby Worm coming down the street to your school, baby.  Not the Imus of now, which is the grumpy,  oh, shut up, Bernard.  Grumpy, broken rib, collapsed lung Imus.  We also have the Lesbo ice cream girls here.  Yeah, they're here, huh?  Yeah, we just got to get the spaz cam hooked up,  and we'll get that going as well.  And here's another clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We're slowly but surely working our way through the contest again,  giving you the highlights.  Later on today, we should finally get to the bug clips, 
[01:03:30]  which are just unbelievable.  Screams of horror.  Yes, but this is when we started pouring the sour milk  on top of their heads with the clumps.  O.B.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point  where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  O.B.  And Anthony.  We just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  1027.  W.N.E.W.  You caught me off guard, O.B. 
[01:04:00]  I was yelling at Anthony, limo Anthony.  I did that on purpose.  And, uh...  Anthony, it's goofball.com.  Goofball.com.  I was checking this out yesterday.  It's pretty cool.  It's fun.  It's free.  It's easy to use.  It's, uh...  If you spend a lot of time at your computer  looking up fun stuff  and, uh...  You know, naked pictures, games,  um...  Internet jokes.  You can spend hours going to different sites  to find all this stuff.  At goofball.com, it's all there for you. 
[01:04:30]  It's like you're one-stop shopping for the moron  that, uh...  Listen, it's like the perfect...  The perfect, uh...  If you listen to this show,  go to goofball.com.  I was on there yesterday.  They got, like, really funny audio and video clips.  And, of course, nudes.  Nude celebrity shots.  Twisted video, uh...  Make you forget work.  Why work when you're at work?  What are you doing?  You're sitting there.  You're doing what the boss told you to do.  You're getting that report in on time.  Oh, please. 
[01:05:00]  Log off of the word processor program  and go to goofball.com.  Just reminded me of a story.  I'm going to get my brother-in-law in trouble,  but...  My brother-in-law?  You were talking about how, you know,  when you're working,  most people are on the computer and stuff, right?  Yeah.  Checking out sick websites and all that?  Well, I'm not going to tell you where he works,  but they have, um...  They have, like, spaz camps  hooked up at all the offices.  So you can check out other offices.  Really?  Right.  So, uh, they decided to check out other offices, 
[01:05:30]  and they decided to check out their Manhattan office.  There's, uh, an employee.  Not only did they catch him  on, on, on the internet  checking out, like, porno and stuff,  but it was gay porno.  Uh-oh.  And the whole freaking company  was able to access this spaz camp.  Oh, wow.  And all you see,  all you see is the back of the guy,  in front of him, a screen,  with just the sickest gay porno...  Oh, my God.  ...picture on his screen.  You know what the funny part is?  That was our own Ken Stevens. 
[01:06:00]  Our boss here at Amy W.  Cat's out of the bag now.  He was telling me this over the weekend.  I was laughing so freaking hard.  God.  Can you imagine?  That's embarrassing.  Because the guy's screwed on many levels  because they call him not working  and, you know, surfing.  And then on top of that,  he's at a gay, uh, website.  You know what's amazing  with the workplace and computers  is they've pretty much given you, uh, games  and things to play with  and not do your work right in front of you. 
[01:06:30]  It's like the old days before computers.  It's like your boss coming up  and throwing a Monopoly game in front of you.  Yeah.  Here you go.  Yeah.  You know, I'm going to play.  Or throwing you a Game Boy or something.  Yeah.  Right.  A Game Boy, anything.  But now we all have computers.  We're not supposed to try to see what it could do?  It's right there.  Yeah.  Go to, uh, goofball.com.  Like I said, free, easy to use.  It's fun.  It's your one-stop place on the Internet  to take time out and, uh, have some fun.  Take a break from the daily grind at work.

You like my breed?  No, she's going to give it to me today.  I didn't even hear it.  I give it a little extra special push when it's for my personal friends.  Remember the old one?  Yeah, I was laughing.  I said, if you want to get banged in the back seat of your limo, go to Vital Limousine. 
[01:08:00]  You're the best.  And what were you saying about driving?  No, nothing, nothing.  I didn't, I swear.  I don't even want to talk to you.  Coming in here is like a war just to get two words in with you.  Well, quickly give a plug then for, uh, your, uh, company.  Oh, wait.  Actually, we have to, we have to give them a real plug today.

[01:27:30]  our differences  before  no we're  on good  terms  with those  guys  now  but I  gotta tell  you  they went  through a  little slump  period  on South  Park  remember that  well yeah  what happened  with all that  was because  they were  writing the  movie  yeah  so they  couldn't  concentrate  you know  on the  show  and also  write the  movie  I guess  you're  right  so the  show  you know  lagged  behind a  little bit  because they  really wanted  to make a  good movie  then the  movie came  out and  then they  got back  to making  really good  TV shows  again  yeah  because they  have gotten  really funny  again  and I love  this because 
[01:28:00]  they're pissing  everybody off  you read in  USA Today  Elizabeth Sneed  does a column  and she's  really pissed  you know  that they're  fuddy  duddy  can't take  anything  when they  start the  column  it's getting  harder to  ruffle my  feathers  these days  oh shut up  you know  it's like  shut up  that means  it's easy  to ruffle  your feathers  correct  first  Blame Canada  nominated for  an Oscar  and then  Matt and  Trey  walking into  the Oscars  with gowns  dressed like 
[01:28:30]  Gwyneth Paltrow  and Jennifer  Lopez  she has a  problem with  that  well she's  lining up  that it's  not their  first little  thing that  they're doing  that pisses  her off  for some  reason I guess  that pissed  her off  okay  now jokes  about  pedophiles  and abortion  in the  season premiere  of South  Park  tomorrow  10pm  I gotta see  this  this sounds  great  but she is  really pissed  off  Cartman  decides  Stan  Kyle and  Kenny  are too  immature  and finds 
[01:29:00]  grown up  pals  at the  real life  organization  the North  American  Man Boy  Love  Association  NAMBLA  Cartman  hooks Stan  Kyle and  Kenny  up  in NAMBLA  that is  great  you know  how funny  that's gonna  be  come on  that's  sick  that's  great  and if  that's  not  enough  in the  subplot  Kenny's  trying to  give his  mom an  abortion  so he  makes her  a morning  after pill  milkshake  uses a 
[01:29:30]  plunger  on her  and then  fools her  into riding  an amusement  park ride  that's not  safe for  pregnant women  called the  John Denver  Experience  it's a  small plane  that careens  through the air  and finally  crashes into  the water  and she's  all pissed  because the  censors had  a problem  with making  fun of  John Denver's  death  like the  abortion thing  and the  pedophile thing  is okay  but they had  to kind of  skate around  the John Denver  death  and she has  a problem  with this  show  that's gonna  be on tomorrow  yeah she's  got a little  bit of a  problem 
[01:30:00]  with this  it sounds  like a  stellar  South Park  coming up  tomorrow night  10 o'clock  on Comedy Central  Cartman, Stan,  Kyle, and Kenny  in Nambla  like guys  trying to  molest them  hey what are  you doing  we gotta get  Matt and Trey  on the show  yeah  we should try  to get them  on the show  tomorrow  yeah I'd love  to talk to them  about this  see what the  hell they were  thinking  so what  it's great  because they're  just getting  worse and worse  the shows 
[01:30:30]  I mean they  don't care  they're really  hitting all the  issues that piss  people off  so what does  this lady  want to happen  nothing I guess  she just thinks  that the censors  should have done  something  they talked  to Trey  he said it's  all about men  molesting young  boys and one  of the kids  having to  take one  for the team  so the other  is going to  escape  Nambla's clutches  so the other  is going to  escape  Nambla's clutches  you know  Cartman's  taking one  Cartman's  going to be  taken  or is it 
[01:31:00]  Kenny  is that how  he dies  hey why don't  we have to  take our  closure  you know  it's just  going to be  unbelievable  those guys  make me laugh  man  yeah  so she's  all pissed  off  but  I mean  you know  something  if she  didn't write  this article  about how  pissed off  it was  I might  have forgotten  that it  was on  and might  not have  watched it  but reading  this  I have to  watch this  now  yeah  these stupid  idiots  do more  damage than  good  I was reading  an article  I think  it was in  the post  today  about me 
[01:31:30]  myself  and Irene  how all  the mental  health  groups  are all  pissed off  about me  myself  and Irene  and this  guy was  commenting  like  you know  because  everyone  is up  in arms  about this  movie  they're getting  so much  free advertising  for this  flick  and a hell  of a lot  more people  are going to  be checking  it out  when it  opens up  this weekend  I believe  it stereotypes  schizophrenic  people as  being  well  schizophrenic  that doesn't  make much  sense at all  does it  that's what  she was saying  I know  she was like  oh don't  call  schizophrenic  people 
[01:32:00]  schizo  well  they're schizo  why not  it's comedy  as long as  it makes me  laugh  I don't  care  how correct  it is  the more  politically  incorrect  the better  I applaud  shows like  South Park  that pump  stuff out  that really  pisses people  off  because  I love  seeing it  it's the  stuff that  makes me  laugh  and I like  the Farley  Brothers  because I  guess this  movie  me  myself  and  Irene  they make  fun  of  everybody  yeah  I saw  one of the  trailers  and the  midget  in there  the black  midget  yeah  yeah  he's like 
[01:32:30]  kicking his  ass and  stuff  it was  pretty funny  you're not  allowed to  make fun  of midgets  these days  Anthony  yes  I don't  think there's  anything you're  allowed to  make fun of  officially  these days  no  anybody that  falls into  a group  I believe  we can  make fun  of the  Amish  because they  don't have  radios  radios  not allowed  to listen  and the  deaf people  and deaf  people  because they  can't  listen  but if  they have  a person  that can  hear  and they  hear  then they'll  tell the  deaf people  which is  kind of  silly  because then  aren't you  doing the  radio show  in sign  language 
[01:33:00]  and pissing  them off  best they  just don't  know  the deaf  people  oh boy  yes we do  walk right  past you  when you're  talking like  we do walk  past not even  glancing  but yes we  did notice  we did  notice  it's so  hard to  walk by  you ever  been in a  room  especially like  a quiet  waiting room  and there's  deaf people  talking  they're signing  but they  insist  why do you  have to  talk as  you're signing  just do  the sign  thing

The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:45:00]  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never gets old.  Home of the Hummer.  1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027, Anthony.  Spagcam up and working.  Yes, it is.  Through WNEW.com.  I was looking at some fine nude breasts on the Spagcam.  And now Psycho Mark is on the couch.  Now you all got a, now all you have is Psycho Mark sitting on the couch. 
[01:45:30]  Now you got an empty couch.  Whoa!  Now you got an empty couch because the girls are in the studio.  Another picture of Nadia Hilton.  Lovely Nadia.  Look at that.  This is more of a revealing shot, may I say?  I'm going to put this right next to my other Nadia Hilton picture.  That's up next to my computer.  Not bad, not bad.  Nadia Hilton.com, everyone.  You can count your rings from this picture.  Hey, how old you are.  Look at that.  That's some shot. 
[01:46:00]  I'm old, huh?  No, no, no.  I can also tell you what you had for lunch.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, that's what I call a, yeah.  That's a nice shot.  That's a lovely little shot there.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Well, thank you.  Kind of awkward to stare at your back door and then see your lovely face in the studio.  Yes, yes.  I guess we could get past that.  So, who did you bring in today, Nadia?  This is Kayla.  You remember from last time, right?  Yeah, but why aren't you guys naked?  You changed your hair.  Yeah, I cut it off.  Yeah, I like it that way, man. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, you lighten it up a little bit.  I know all this stuff.  And you noticed?  What are you, a fig?  I might have noticed the haircut in the lap.  But on the head, who was looking me?  He just noticed everything.  I guess so.  You know?  Oh, now the spaz cam is in the studio, huh?  What?  It was a perfect shot.  Someone's going to...  Just set up the spaz cam outside.  Set it up outside.  Get a perfect shot. 
[01:47:00]  The shot we had before was perfect.  We probably won't be able to get that.  All we want is the spaz cam.  No one touched the spaz cam because everyone says it complains because it's all blurry.  It's a big, blurry mess.  All the girls look like Picasso paintings when people wave it around.  Let me see your...  Oh, I'm not aiming my help at the other one.  All right.  You can still take your clothes off.  I mean, there's no rules against that.  Yeah, we can sit here topless.  Can't we all?  All right.  And this is Sable, by the way.  Hi, Sable.  Hi.  You're new to the radio show? 
[01:47:30]  Yes, I am.  And what's your deal?  I'm a first-timer.  Yeah?  You've got a website, too.  Everyone has a website.  Yeah, they do.  SableMinks with an X dot com.  Absolutely.  SableMinks dot com and NadiaHilton dot com.  A couple of great websites to check out today.  And what do you do for a living there, Sable?  Well, just finished my first porn.  Oh, you did?  Your first porn?  First porn.  Well, tell us about it.  What's the storyline?  I was kind of inducted into the Nadia Hall of Fame, so... 
[01:48:00]  Yeah?  It was her and I.  Okay, you two.  Doing a lesbo porn, huh?  Mm-hmm.  And we had an addition to it after.  Absolutely.  We had a couple different scenes.  Yeah.  He was the addition.  Oh, what?  You came in there and banged them?  Yeah?  I banged one of them.  Yeah?  That would be me.  Oh, you banged them?  Yeah?  So what...  Hey, how about that?  There was some lesbian stuff going on, and then he comes in and wrecks the fantasy for  all the guys watching the show.  Yeah, pretty much.  I hate that.  Right?  Yeah, we don't like that. 
[01:48:30]  We don't like the bobshot.  The porno bobshot.  Back of...  And then the slang for testicles.  Right.  Back of bag.  I don't think I did that.  Back of the yam bag shot.  Yeah, that is just the worst shot known to porn.  And just when you're getting all juiced up watching the chick, you've got to look at  the guy's face going like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You're like, oh, I just wrecked it.  Dang.  Can we concentrate on the girls?  Please. 
[01:49:00]  Well, see, by that point, you guys are supposed to be doing the same thing.  Exactly.  Yeah, but I don't want to, you know, if I'm grabbing and tugging, looking at a movie,  I'm not going to be looking, all of a sudden you're looking at a girl going, okay, that's  cool.  And then, ah, it's a guy face.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, God.  I don't want to see that.  Or the bobshot.  The bobshot.  All of a sudden you're looking at leather cheerio and yam bag.  They're slapping.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  As the dice man loves to say.  So that was your first porno? 
[01:49:30]  Absolutely.  And have you done magazine stuff before that?  Commercially, yes.  Yeah, commercially.  First one commercially available.  For myself, I've done it, but.  Oh, yeah.  That's something to show to the mass public.  This is the first one?  And are you going to make a career out of this?  Huh?  Career.  A career out of this?  See, I know what your mind is.  Yeah, I know.  Stop right there.  It's right in the, in the back door.  You had to show a picture of your butt before it started talking.  I know.  So, hey.  It wasn't just my butt.  So how can people check out this porn?  You have to talk to the Bloss Woman.  What's the name of it? 
[01:50:00]  She broke my cherry, so she's in charge, yeah.  Oh, it's being edited, unnamed as of yet.  The working title?  Titanic 2, right?  Trying to get people to come to the movie.  Wow, nice.  Is it done in the gonzo style of spaz?  Porn in the gonzo style?  No.  I figured everyone in the porn industry knows that.  All right.  I think we're ready.  Is it going to have a catchy title?  Like a movie that's out or something like that?  I don't know.  We don't know yet.  Actually, I'm trying to go for the real sex. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Like Saving Ryan's Privates.  They kind of do it with Tom Yanks.  They kind of do like a play on the words, nothing like that.  I was thinking of the Muffcateers and Dick Tannion.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  Me, myself, and my rear.  Well, there's no Pizza Man or anything.  It's just fun from the beginning to the end.  Yeah.  Done in 60 seconds.  That would be bad.  No, no, no.  Hey, you wouldn't even have to change the name of, like, Shaft.  Right?  See? 
[01:51:00]  Isn't that amazing?  Someone's got to pick that up.  Or Mission Impossible for that.  So, very good.  Porno.  Entering the porno field.  Absolutely.  Congratulations.  Looking forward to seeing some of your work.  You're just glad he ate her.  Gladiator.  Right?  Gladiator.  That's what I said.  Come on.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  You could use that one.  Exactly.  So, you didn't do well on the SATs? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, what happened?  I do better on the EATs than the SATs.  Oh, that's good.  Very good.  I'll give you a wacky one.  The EAT is open.  Well, Ann, I think the spaz cam is ready.  They got a perfect shot.  That's the lesbian couch in the background, if you're checking out the spaz cam right now.  The lesbian couch.  Now there's our names on the blue tarp, Anthony.  I see that.  You can't really read it.  Well, because it's the O&A Blue Tarp Cabaret.  We like to call these little sessions we do with the ladies. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I know.  It says O&A Blue Tarp Cabaret, 1027-WNAW, anything.  All right.  If you guys want to get naked, that would be great.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can go to that.  We wouldn't, you know, run off screaming.  Oh, my God.  Naked girls.  Stop.  Stop.  Put those clothes on.  We have a game for you guys to participate in.  What is it called?  Well, if you're good at target practice, you can get them to do certain things.  Oh, yeah?  Like...  I hope you have some skills.  What are we going to...  You should see.  Oh, yeah.  I have to say.  I play darts.  Don't give away any darts.  I used to be a hoop star. 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  Ah, now it's the fur hoop.  Don't joke, because it won't be any fun.  Oh, cool.  I think we're going to be shooting some hoops in.  All right.  We'll make our way out to the Blue Tarp Cabaret.  Okay.  Used to be called the imaginary ballroom when this place had a little bit of self-respect  in class.  Now, who gives a flying F?  Do the girls need to get naked and stuff?  Should we take a quick break and come back?  Would that be the best thing to do, Rick?  And then we will see them and all the goodies in what we like to call the Vinskelsa Suite. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  We're going to take a pretty quick break here.  Yeah.  And we'll be back with the Lesbian Ice Cream Girls.  They're lovely.  We've got Nadia and Kayla and Sable.  Check out NadiaHilton.com and Sable Mink with an X.  Mink, I'm sorry, with an X.com.  Okay?  Yes.  As we go to break, what the hell?  Another piece of audio from the 55-gallon drum challenge from this past Friday.  Don't forget to check out the video clips on foundrymusic.com when you get home tonight. 
[01:53:30]  Okay?  Yes.  Here we go.  I think we're finally to the bugs, Anthony.  This is another quitter.  Oh, this is Christy Quitting.  Yep.  The big green one is Christy Quitting, right?  Okay.  This is Christy Quitting.  She couldn't take it anymore.  What did you learn on the show?  I'm not a functioning idiot without a high school diploma to get a job on the radio.  All right, and screw taking a break.  We got the lesbian ice cream girls outside the studio ready to go. 
[01:54:00]  They're completely naked.  The spaz cam is on through WNAW.com.  Let's get the hell out of the studio and check out the festivities.  I'm all over the cord.  Get out of my mic cord, you son of a bitch.  I'm trying.  It's like Linguini.  Let's set up the mic cord.  All right.  We got Psycho Mark.  He's working already.  He's working the field mic.  Okay, look.  Look, first of all, no one stand over there because you can't be in the way of the spaz cam.  We got Kayla on the ground.  She's topless.  And she's got icing on her boobs, Anthony. 
[01:54:30]  Yes, they're icing up her breasts very, very nicely.  Vanilla icing covering up the entire breast.  The Brestal area.  Brestal.  The Breastesses, as Old Dirty would say.  We got two girls sitting sideline on the couch.  Wait, what do you got?  A little cream on your breast, too, don't you?  Yeah.  You guys get to have target practice.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  I think I get the gist of what's going to happen here.  Are we trying to get the cherry in the middle of the work of art? 
[01:55:00]  Probably be.  Yes, Nadia gives Nadia the mic.  Bullseye.  Nadia, are those real?  Real expensive.  Really?  That's one of the best breast jobs I've ever seen in my life.  Pretty good there.  Very nice.  Thank you.  She moves them around a little bit.  Yeah, I see that.  Here, turn around to the spaz cam so they can take a peek at those lovely, lovely.  There you go.  All right, where's the chef?  What are we doing today?  We have a couple of chefs.  Oh, look at that.  Have you been in any pornos with these ladies? 
[01:55:30]  Chef number two?  Yes, yes, I have.  You have?  No, the other chef has.  And look at his arm.  He's shaking like a leaf trying to get the breasts all decorated.  Chef number two, have you been in any pornos with these ladies?  No, I haven't.  No?  Do you want to?  I hope to one of these days.  Yeah.  All right, talk to the other chef.  What are we doing today, sir?  Well, you and Anthony are going to throw cherries at these young ladies.  Yeah.  And any two that you hit in a bullseye have to make out.  Oh, well, that's good. 
[01:56:00]  And we'll get into some more interesting stuff after, but.  You guys just sit around and figure out what to do with naked ladies?  You mean the girls, not us, right?  I'm going to make a Vigelvis later.  Vigelvis?  A Vigelvis.  A Vigelvis.  I can't wait.  A Vigelvis after this.  I'm just going to get eaten.  Wow, that's going to take a lot of icing.  Cover those up.  Look at that.  Those are lovely.  Okay, well, are we ready to throw the cherries? 
[01:56:30]  No, he's still decorating.  There are teams.  Screw the decoration, Anthony.  A lot of chefs involved on our program.  I see that.  Last week or so, we had a guy cooking rats, two chefs.  And now we have wonderful chefs preparing boobs and a Vigelvis.  A Vigelvis.  That's what I'm very excited about.  I can't wait to see the Vigelvis.  Yes.  All right.  They've made some type of dark board on their boobs, I would say.  They put white frosting all over both breasts and then drew little dark board marks on it with some brown frosting. 
[01:57:00]  And now we're waiting for him to cover the other boob.  Right.  What, Kayla?  We have to keep that color frosting up top.  Oh, yeah?  Just don't use the cherry color down below again.  Yeah, remember last time?  That was a little disturbing.  The cherry frosting or cherry pie filling, I think it was.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It looks like a damn crime scene.  It looks like, remember the movie Carrie when she's in the shower? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  And she gets her first period?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  All right, now we've got Sable, who didn't do well on the SATs, laying down together.  I remember they were a lot more, what's the word I'm looking for?  Naked.  That's it.  Thank you.  They were a lot more naked last time they were here.  Yeah, you girls shy today or something?  A little shy?  No?  They're waiting for Nadia to give them the sign to get naked.  Hi, sign.  All right.  That's nice. 
[01:58:00]  This is the prep time.  Yeah, I see that, Anthony.  You've got to bear with us.  Well, we could take a break and come back and do some target practicing.  While they're doing that?  Yeah, he's still got another boob to go.  One boob to go out of six.  Let me see.  Oh, he's almost.  Aren't you glad we brought two chefs?  Yeah, we're very glad.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're really concerned with who you bring.  And you want to take a break?  I'm talking for speed.  Yeah, we could do that. 
[01:58:30]  We'll take a break.  We'll take a break and then we'll come back and throw some cherries at your boobs.  And hopefully the girls will be completely naked by the time we get back.  And I've just heard.  I think they're all right about me.  I'm not completely naked.  Vag Elvis is in the building.  Vag Elvis is in the building.  Not yet.  All right.  We're hanging out with NadiaHilton.com and her girls.  And we're going to be doing some target practicing with their boobs.  That's all I know.  In a few minutes here.  It's WNEW.  Stay there.  The O.P.  And the nation.  The show.  Bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff.  Bluff, bluff, bluff. 
[01:59:00]  The O.P.  And the nation.  Bluff, bluff, bluff.  The show blows monkey ass.  WNEW.  Wow.  All right.  We're back.  Blue Tark Cabaret.  We got the three lovely young ladies and their breasts all covered with some kind of vanilla icing, I guess.  Cake icing.  Yes.  And then, you know, the stuff you write, like, happy birthday on the cakewalk.  Yeah.  They made booby dartboards. 
[01:59:30]  Booby dartboards.  On their boobs.  I finally figured this out.  Those are dartboards.  We got the cherries that are the arrows, right?  Yeah.  Those are the darts.  Call me Einstein.  Wow.  Einstein.  I love the appreciation for the spaz cam by some of the people.  I read one post that said, get the guy out from in front of the thing.  It is too much light.  Make the girls close.  Don't move the camera fast.  Now, it's like a director is on the other end of the instant feedback, freaking out.  Yeah, and spanking it, typing with one hand.  Yeah, we're doing the best we can. 
[02:00:00]  If you want to check out the spaz cam, it's at www.com.  But the girls are ready.  We got Nadia from NadiaHilton.com.  Hello.  We got SableMinks with an X.com.  Yeah, brand new star of the porno industry.  Yeah, she just filmed her first porno.  And, of course, Kyla.  Kyla.  Kyla, I'm sorry.  I always say Kyla.  Kyla, who doesn't have a website?  I will soon.  But has a very nice hairdo.  A brand new hairdo, Anthony.  Brand new hairdo.  Yes.  All right, so what do we do?  The boobs are ready.  Do we have to dip the cherries into anything?  We have to dip the cherries into this, Ant. 
[02:00:30]  Why?  So you need any of those?  Wait, wait, wait.  Get on the air.  All right.  The chef's going to explain the rules of the game, Anthony.  Okay.  All you guys have to do is toss them.  And if you get any one of those rings, they're going to take off an article of clothing.  Then after you get the clothing off, when you hit it, they have to do something else.  Is the cherry going to stick or just leave a red mark?  We haven't tested it.  We're letting you test that.  Okay.  All right.  Anthony's really good at darts.  Right between the two.  Right between the two.  I'm going for Nadia. 
[02:01:00]  Okay.  Did we get that sound on the radio?  It just went splat on her left boob.  That like splattered.  Wait, take off a piece of clothing.  I hit it.  Right?  This is my prize.  There you go.  All right.  She took a shoe off, Anthony.  I'm going to try.  Oh, yeah.  That was pretty good.  That's real.  I got it in the second ring.  Did you hear that noise?  We get to throw stuff at chicks.  This rocks, man. 
[02:01:30]  That is good.  I'm never going to grow up.  She took a shoe off.  All right.  Why don't you shoot again?  Okay.  Kayla's a little nervous.  Here we go.  Oh.  Hit her in the rib cage.  I hear that.  Let me go for it.  Oh, you got her in the neck.  Pearl necklace.  Why can't we hit you?  I don't know why we can't really hit you.  I mean, the target's big enough, right?  Okay.  Anyone else want to shoot the cherries?  I got her resting on top of that.  That works.  Yeah, take some clothes off for that one.  Take some clothes off. 
[02:02:00]  Wow.  Is she going for the pants?  Yeah.  Right away?  Get the field mic.  Nice.  I'm going with undies.  Wow.  All right.  She's got undies on.  Hey, can we play basketball next?  Screw them.  Okay.  All right.  Let's go for Nadia again, Anthony.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And I didn't move him.  That's pretty funny.  This is a pretty twisted game.  I'm getting into this.  Just let me grab a handful.  That doesn't count. 
[02:02:30]  That doesn't count.  No, it hit me in the middle.  Oh.  Oh.  Here, just start throwing stuff at them.  Here we go.  Underhand him if you have to kill.  Underhand him.  Oh, sorry.  I hit you in the hand.  Thanks, Anthony.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Hit Nadia.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Here we go.  This has got to be a bullseye.  All right.  You're just tuning in.  We're throwing cherry darts at girls' boobs.  It's not a weighted cherry.  And if we hit the dartboard, they have to take off a piece of clothing. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, they're moving closer now.  Here we go.  Is that close enough?  Jordan Anthony.  All right.  Get naked.  I don't know you, but you're just looking at me.  Get naked.  All right.  Get naked.  Wow.  Nottie is naked.  Nottie is completely naked.  NottieHilton.com naked.  Oh, that was a good shot.  That was good.  All right.  Can you get on all fours?  I want to change the rules.  All right.  All right.  Balloon not target.  Yeah.  Balloon not target practice.  Excuse me.  Balloon not. 
[02:03:30]  Turn around.  You did a porno.  Let's go.  You did a porno.  Whoa.  Look at that target.  Wow.  Okay.  Here we go.  Now, this game's much better now.  She's on all fours.  NottieHilton.com.  We got the cherries, and we're going.  Oh, that's it.  Oh, my God.  This is the best game ever.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We got that, Rick.  Oh, look at me.  Not bad, Rick. 
[02:04:00]  I have an orange cookie.  Ben just ate a cherry and it's stuck.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you get me?  This is the most degrading game ever, but I like it.  I like it.  I like it.  Anthony, explain what the hell's going on.  I'm going to be right in the middle of the bump.  I'm going to be right in the middle of the bump into the ravine.  Into the ravine.  They're going in.  No one has hit Nottie's ravine.  Oh, my God.  Somebody hit me square. 
[02:04:30]  I just.  This is Abel's got a pretty good target, Anthony.  Wow.  All right.  People are just losing their minds here.  This could be a great carnival game.  This is the best game ever.  This rocks.  What else can we do?  I'm amazed.  What?  Did I hit anybody?  What just hit Spass in the leg?  You don't know where that cherry's been, Spass. 
[02:05:00]  All right, Anthony, screw throwing the cherries at the Blue Nuts.  Where's the squash?  Wow.  We're running out of cherries, though.  Nottie is just really lining that target up.  They suck.  They can't even get it.  I could get it.  Oh, just missed.  I hope he's winding up.  That was the start of the day.  Don't ever say I can't get it.  She actually had to pull that one out. 
[02:05:30]  I swear to God.  Made a noise and went.  Oh, yeah.  This is twisted, man.  I know you need to target, you guys.  All right.  Very nice.  Throwing cherries at the Kiki.  Unbelievable.  The Kiki game.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right, wait, wait.  Rick hit the target so hard, she fell down. 
[02:06:00]  All right, well, I think we're done with the cherry game.  Yeah, that was a wonderful game.  I think we're done.  Thank you, ladies.  Wow.  Wait, we got a few more cherries left.  It's like paintball.  Paintball.  Well, I look like that.  Oh, this is boring doing the front way.  All right.  We like the back way.  Okay, wait.  Let's put a stand up. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, there you go.  Oh, my God.  Different elevation of targets now.  Sam.  Girls.  Oh, my God.  All right, here.  Put it over here.  Oh, trying for the shot.  Oh.  Paintball going.  All right, Ann, I think we're done with the cherry game.  You know what's amazing, though?  Here is something that you guys are doing that you don't even realize you're doing unless  you do.  Anthony and Rick.  I've seen this so far.  Anthony is going up, taking the cherries that have already been thrown, putting them  in the big thing of icing. 
[02:07:00]  You guys are taking them out, throwing, and then licking the icing off your fingers.  Congratulations.  You are now married in some countries.  Countries, I think.  I heard countries.  All right, that was a lot of fun.  Wow.  Let's hear it for the girls.  Where's Vag Elvis?  I want Vag Elvis.  Are we doing...  Hey, where's the chef?  Where's the chef?  Here, Mike the chef, Psycho Mark.  What's up next, chef?  Well, I think we're going to paint some bikinis on them. 
[02:07:30]  They're going to lick them off.  And, yes, it's going to be the lower half.  Very nice.  All right.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, yes.  Wow, could you believe...  I don't...  That shot, you did?  Unbelievable.  She's got to give you props.  She's still trying to fight.  That wasn't me, was it?  Yeah.  Me?  You got me?  It made a sound.  It wasn't your hood.  Anyway, okay, NaughtyHilton.com, SableMinks with an X.com, and Kayla. 
[02:08:00]  And Kayla would know.com, but she has a lovely new hairdo.  Okay, Anthony?  Lovely.  Let's take a quick break.  Only a couple minutes here, and we'll be back with the Lesbian Ice Cream Girls in just a bit.  It's WNW.  Behind the senior.  Hold on.  This is going to be the old sexual device.  Still go.  Still go.  Still go.  Behind the playful talk.  Do you know how many guys wish to could suck their...  Behind the glamour.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:08:30]  We'll leave you with the sounds of a sea in the mouth.  Behind the horn.  With Opie and Anthony.  You'll never look at Gash the same way again.  On 1027.  Somebody ready, WNW.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Having lots of fun today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Getting the show back on track.  Having fun with lesbians.  Oh, yeah.  That was a fun little game we played with the Lesbian Ice Cream Girls.  I'm reading the instant feedback coming in. 
[02:09:00]  A lot of people checking it out on the Spaz Cam off of the WNW site.  And a lot of people are a little aggravated that Big Kevin is in every friggin' picture.  He's in every shot.  He's sitting in the chair behind the girls.  And, you know, you've got the lovely ladies there and then Kevin.  Big Kevin, you can't sit on the couch.  That's too bad.  That's too bad.  Well, the girls are cleaning out their cracks.  I think we could say that.  Yeah.  And the chefs are painting bikinis on them with icing and then we're going to take the bikinis off the ladies. 
[02:09:30]  But that cherry game was hilarious.  They had little dart boards on their boobs and we had to throw the cherries at the boobs and they stuck and stuff.  And I was like, okay, this is fun for about two minutes.  Great.  And then we had them on all fours and we started doing the real target practice.  All fours.  Oh, my God.  Opie had the throw of the day.  It landed. 
[02:10:00]  It just went thwock and didn't move.  The cherry just stayed there.  Well, it almost disappeared, to tell you the truth.  It was just off the hook.  I was looking at you.  It was.  First time a cherry's been in that area in many years.  Oh, come on.  It's a little joke.  All right.  I'm looking at the spaz cam right now.  Yeah.  Girl on the floor.  Just laying there.  Getting her bikini put on her.  You know, there is a lighting problem with that camera.  Is there any way to dim the light in there? 
[02:10:30]  Dim the light down because there's a lot of glare.  13-year-olds boot up.  We got naked chicks on www.com or spaz cam.  All guys that are going through puberty right now, here's your chance.  Here is your chance.  I want to see how this works now, I think.  Big Kev, get your body out of the way.  Wow.  That's a shot.  Someone's, like, finger is in the camera.  How does that work?  I did not touch the camera. 
[02:11:00]  Not once.  I swear.  No, you were in every shot.  Yeah, you were in every shot.  Our horny listeners do not want to see your massive body in the background.  I agree.  I know it's tough to get out of shots because you're so big, but try another room.  Okay.  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  Jeff.  Jeff.  What's going on, Jeff?  That was the funniest sound I've ever heard of cherry smacking.  I know.  That was smacking against ass.  All right.  How did you guys keep from not getting excited when they turned around and you started throwing 
[02:11:30]  them home?  My God.  I wasn't throwing them.  I was hitting them.  Like that.  Who could concentrate, right?  I was flinging them off my homemade, you know.  Hope was doing great.  He landed it right in.  I had like knob lock throws.  I was hitting Big Kevin.  I can't throw.  Oh, man.  That was great.  Yeah, my one shot was nothing but net, if you know what I'm saying.  You know what the worst part was?  That's better.  Now, look.  That is a perfect shot. 
[02:12:00]  Now, the lighting is correct.  See, I'm helping you guys out there.  I'm reading your feedback.  I'm listening.  Let me see.  That's a good shot.  Oh, yeah.  Perfect.  The girl's just completely naked outside the studio right now.  WNW.com.  Did you see what was going on, though, with Anthony picking the cherries up?  Yeah.  Did you realize that?  Yeah, he's in the studio.  He was picking the cherries up off of the blue tarp after they had been in the most intimate of these girls' areas and then picking them up and putting them back in the icing thing.  You guys are taking them out with your fingers, throwing them, and then licking your fingers. 
[02:12:30]  In essence, you were licking A.  And I might have to leave the show after that shot I threw.  George Steinbrenner's on the phone.  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  You know, the guys are playing second base for the Yanks, but before you know it.  That is a perfect picture on the website.  I hope you're appreciative, people.  Of course they are, Anthony.  Most interactive radio show in America.  We give you stuff here. 
[02:13:00]  You check out what we check out on most occasions.  Let's go to Bill on Line 7.  Bill, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Someone tells me Naubach would not be good at this game.  You guys keep me to it, but just had to throw that in.  All right.  Go Sox.  Go Sox.  Go Sox!  Let's go, Pedro.  Yeah, please.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  The girls are getting their bikinis put on.  This could be some sick stuff in a little while.  Yeah.  And then they're going to lick them off each other. 
[02:13:30]  Hey, Ope, if you hit that any harder, you would need a cherry picker.  Yeah.  I thought you were going to need a corkscrew to get that cherry out.  Hey, ONA, this is the best free porno cam on the web.  Yeah.  We give you free smut.  Thank you for this great service because a 14-year-old can't go to porn sites, allegedly.  Where are you going to go for your porno?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Are you sure that's a finger on the cam?  Oh, that's even better.  They dim the light even a little more, it looks like.  Now you're just seeing girl.  You know what was happening before?  The girls were so fuzzy and whited out that they were looking bigger than they were. 
[02:14:00]  So we were getting instant feedbacks going, hey, those girls are big.  No, they're not.  Look at them.  They're beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  On the cam.  This guy I lied to would pay money to eat the cherries.  Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  How are you?  Good.  I come out of work.  I'm working in Brooklyn.  I work for doctors.  It's boring work.  I come out and I turn on to listen to this.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:14:30]  Who's got a better job than you guys?  Ah, no one.  No one.  We know that.  We feel guilty every day, trust me.  I'm trying to picture you driving back home at the end of the day.  It went through your mind.  Yeah.  It's like I got the best job in the world.  Without a doubt.  But Anthony, what is your problem with cleaning the cream off the cherries, brother?  Please.  I'll look.  I don't want to put my tongue anywhere.  I don't know where it's been. 
[02:15:00]  Jesus.  Hey, look.  Look at the picture of that guy isolated.  Bullseye, red eye, well eye.  Very nice.  She's picking the cherry out.  That's my shot.  Yeah.  Where's that picture?  He's got it on the website.  He's got it on the website?  Yeah.  I want that job.  Thank you, Dennis.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, you're 13 years old.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm doing great, dude.  Those pictures have completely changed my life.  You know, if only there was something like this when I was growing up, Opie. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  You know, we didn't have anything like this.  We had to sneak out and try to steal Playboys from our friends' parents and stuff like that.  But we're still from the stationery store.  Yeah.  You know.  But this is something.  You have such a life of smut to look forward to in front of you, Steve.  Yeah, that's better than the porn I could see in my friends' house.  Yeah.  Very good, Steve.  Have fun.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  What do you say?  Yeah, what do you say? 
[02:16:00]  Hey, Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How old are you, Matt?  Me?  Yeah.  I'm 14.  All right.  That's what I'm calling to say.  There is no other place on earth where puberty and adolescence can be so much effing fun.  Say that.  I'm telling you, you guys do more than a public service.  You guys do a public bang almost, I swear.  Glad we can assist you through the hardships that are puberty.  Yes. 
[02:16:30]  Syndication and syndication lines are funny again.  Later, guys.  All right, Matt.  Hey, wait.  That's funny.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  It could happen any time.  Paradox.  All right, Anthony.  Well, are the girls almost ready out there?  Yeah.  Are they?  We're going to step back out?  Yeah, we should step out a minute here.  Please let me get back in.  Okay.  I'm going to show that picture.  Okay.  Ah, all three in a row.  Look at that.  Six boobs across.  All right, Anthony, why don't we do this?  Why don't we play another? 
[02:17:00]  We're not going to take a break.  We'll keep going here.  Why don't we play another clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge?  We're trying to get rid of all these clips.  Yeah.  All right.  I think this is a clip when we dump the bugs in the barrels.  This is where it just gets absolutely insane.  Horrific.  And you can check out video clips on foundrymusic.com.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  Steve will be putting clips up for the rest of the week.  But here we go.  Another clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge from Friday.  Girls just losing as we dump bugs into the barrels. 
[02:17:30]  And right after this, we'll be outside the studio with the lesbian ice cream girls.  Lots going on on the O&A show today.  Check this out.  Fran is 84 years old.  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  No, anal is okay.  Trainwreck radio.  The Opie and Anthony show.  1027 WNEW.  We're back outside the studio.  Yes, we have the three lovely ladies on the blue tarp.  They have frosting, like icing bikinis made on them. 
[02:18:00]  But they have little additions.  Opie.  Chocolate chips that look like puby hair.  Yeah.  And then right in the middle, they cut a banana in half and shoved that on there.  So it almost looks like they are hermaphrodites.  Yeah.  Yeah, the bananas are protruding from their bikini area.  Yes.  Where's the chef?  What are we doing?  So I guess, uh...  They are going to eat these bikini bottoms in a three-way configuration. 
[02:18:30]  Ah, the only three-way configuration.  Maneuver that we did before, but we'll have to do it again.  The three-way maneuver.  This is more difficult than the Blue Angels up in the sky with the fighter planes.  The three-way maneuver.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  Watch out.  Kayla's got the strawberry on her coochie.  Yeah, she's got a strawberry.  Nadia's bikini is see-through at this point.  Yes.  It's eating itself.  Yeah, it really is.  It's amazing.  It seems to be a little hot down there. 
[02:19:00]  The bikini's melting away in certain areas.  Well, the icing sure does look lip-smacking good.  I got to say, why?  Why?  We're all having fun.  You need to be on the bottom.  And it looks like Sable hasn't eaten today.  All right.  All right.  They're trying to figure out how to do this.  This could take a while.  You ever see the sloppy kid at the birthday party that gets icing all over him?  Yes.  That's what that looks like.  Only if the kid had a beard.  All right?  That's all. 
[02:19:30]  Okay.  That way.  That way.  I think three girls are trying to figure it out.  Yes!  That way!  We have it.  It's like figuring out that top trigonometry problem at school.  It's almost like synchronization.  They're getting into the three-way position.  Wow.  Oh, that's some shot right there.  It took a while, but they figured out how to get up.  She can get that thing moving up there.  All right.  So the girls are in a triangle now, Anthony.  Don't you see that?  I see it, Ann.  I see it. 
[02:20:00]  All that's missing is the pole.  She's bragging about her martial arts skills, Ann.  Martial arts.  Care.  Are you sure you're consuming it?  What do you think?  Long food.  Exactly.  All right.  Are we waiting for a sign?  Thank you.  Oh, there they go.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Okay.  They are, uh...  They are, um...  Yeah.  They are, uh...  Yes.  Wow.  Let me get another field mic down there, Anthony. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Why don't you get down to the field?  Okay.  Um...  Oh, my God.  We'll get right in there.  Ground zero.  Oh, you know...  You don't get this at Disney.com, do you?  Wow.  How does it taste?  Well, I think we're looking good.  Yummy?  Oh, my God!  Me, doggy!  Oh, the sounds of...  I can't describe what these are the sounds of. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, wow.  Yes.  That's so lovely.  Oh, my goodness.  That's great.  That's great.  Yeah, we're going to try and get those out of there.  Yeah, right?  It's a Carville three-way logo.  Come on, Carville.  Let's bubble lick off.  Wednesdays.  Some days, Tuesdays, Lesbian Day.  And Carville...  This is a brand new... 
[02:21:30]  It certainly does.  But please, girls, no Fudgie the Whale.  Wow.  What the...  That is amazing, girl.  Okay.  What the...  F-ing all.  This girl's got some leg action going.  That is amazing.  She gets it right over her head like that.  God, you could have sex in a suitcase. 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  What was that?  I was asking.  Can we rotate?  Oh, no.  Rotate.  Rotate.  What's the idea?  I was worried it was going to look like a Mr. Softee machine in a minute.  That's amazing.  It's a self-serve.  I think they want to see Vigelvis.  Oh, we got to do the...  Vigelvis.  The Vigelvis?  Do we have time for Vigelvis?  And then we'll do a Vigelvis.  Here, talk to...  What is Mr. Chef saying?  A hunko, hunko. 
[02:22:30]  They can do a counterclockwise eating.  Counterclockwise, yes.  We got to get exactly the right caloric intake.  Yes, of course.  There we go.  Oh, yeah.  See, now we get the view we didn't get before.  Oh.  Now we get to...  Your other leg has to go off now, right?  Yeah.  That's a bad one.  We could spend the next...  What, a bad one?  Wow.  Yeah, that's...  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah, she's going to get something right over her head.  That's what you're looking at when you said that's amazing?  Oh, okay.  Oh, what were you looking at? 
[02:23:00]  What, are you kidding?  We're going to get it later.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at that.  We're all going to get it later, yes.  Look at what she...  Oh, my goodness.  Look at that.  Listen to those sounds.  It's like dropping a mic into, like, a fish tank.  Yeah, like the sonar, you hear the whale songs.  Only this is the sounds of the three-way. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  Icing on my face.  Yeah, there's icing on your face.  Yeah, there's icing on your face.  While you're down there, could you search for my high school classroom? 
[02:24:00]  That's amazing.  Oh, yeah.  Psycho Mark, you haven't been near them.  How'd you get frosting on your pants?  Oh.  All right, very nice.  That was wonderful.  That was nice.  Yeah, we're speechless once again today.  Very good.  Look what you did to us again.  Is that a DJ stuttering?  Is that a DJ stuttering? 
[02:24:30]  It's like this little smudge right on your nose.  All right, are we going to set up for Vag Elvis?  Yes.  Yes.  How are you going to get that cream off your mouth now?  Yeah.  Wow, some got on her nose.  How do I get this on?  How did that happen?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's very nice.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  All right, Ann, one thing.  Oh, yeah, you got it.  You got it.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:25:00]  Why don't they set up for the Vag Elvis?  I guess this is the showstopper coming up.  Vag Elvis.  What is the Vag Elvis?  Give the chef guy the mic.  Get the $55.  You look adorable.  Yeah, give us a little on what we can expect from Vag Elvis.  Well, you've ever seen a vagina with an Elvis hairdo and sideburns?  Hmm, interesting.  Okay.  Vag Elvis.  Vag Elvis.  Vag Elvis on the way.  I'm looking forward to it.  On the O&A show.  Yeah.  We'll be back in a few minutes.  Stay there.  It's any W. 
[02:25:30]  All put to the door.  Don't you have any self-respect?  Aren't you embarrassed to sell it to your family?  I hope he has asked for me.  You're inhuman slime!  107-WNEW.  I know we're in the middle of commercials, but I've got to go to line nine real fast there.  Chris, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Chris, you're on the radio.  What's going on?  Fellas, you guys are killing me.  I've been licking my lips like Chronicle Boy Chapstick.  I think these girls are going to need Chapstick.  I can't make any damn deliveries.  That's funny, Chris. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, my God.  Very good.  Thank you.  You guys are the best.  All right, man.  Bye.  The best.  Bye.  All right, Anthony.  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  Bud Light salutes all the O&A listeners, right?  When we're sitting around watching girls doing each other, what are we drinking?  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  Ice cold Bud Light.  This is what you want to drink during the summer.  We love it.  It tastes like Bud.  I don't even know. 
[02:26:30]  Someone hands me a bottle of Bud Light.  I think they give me a Bud when I drink it.  I don't notice any difference in the taste.  It's not like you're drinking a light beer.  It's great.  Cool, refreshing.  We are proud Bud Light drinkers.  No lime needed with Bud Light.  Have one today.  Bud Light is indeed the life of the party.  Make it a Bud Light all summer long.  Drink it while you're watching the Yankees.  Counts the Sox.  The Sox 22 to 1.  Yeah.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Pummeled.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Or even when you're hanging out watching the Mets. 
[02:27:00]  Why not?  Bud Light.  Bud Light salutes all of Opie and Anthony's listeners.  When Pauls call up, you treat them like, you know, good people.  You don't talk down to them.  Hey, fuck you.  Jesus Christ, shut up.  You idiot.  You're such a loser.  Hey, fuck you.  What a retard.  You're high.  Are you stupid?  Hey, fuck you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, we have another clip to add to that promo from yesterday's show. 
[02:27:30]  Me ripping the phones out of the wall.  You know, today is the type of radio that I think that twat Lynn Samuels would love.  Right?  I think so.  Oh, uh, Lynn Samuels?  This is the award-winning radio that she would just love.  Now you gotta explain yourself, Anthony.  Uh.  Well, she doesn't like our show.  We saw a posting of hers that she wrote her own self. 
[02:28:00]  And, uh, she doesn't like us very much.  Let's see.  What did she write?  Lynn Samuels.  Oh, she's on some station around here.  I don't know.  One that no one listens to.  With that annoying voice.  I'd rather listen to deaf people argue.  Then...  I can't bring myself...  Here's what she writes.  I can't bring myself to listen to ONA.  But I have been listening to Vince Scalza for as long as I can remember. 
[02:28:30]  Must be a long-ass time.  He is humorous, intelligent, insightful.  Sweet.  He's really ideal.  Oh, no.  That's McGillie Gorilla.  It's such elegant intelligence.  He's humorous, intelligent, insightful, spiritual...  ...spiritual, and has a wonderful taste in music.  He has been a delight and inspiration to me as long as I have been on the radio.  I will never forget the comfort he brought to so many of us the night John Lennon was murdered. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, thank God for Vin.  We never would have made it through.  Vin is in short...  Vin is short?  Oh, no.  In short.  Everything ONA or not.  It is pathetic that for whatever reason radio is degenerated to the point that they are doing afternoon drive in New York City...  ...and Vin is only on once a week.  No.  That's not radio degenerating to a point.  That's the audience speaking. 
[02:29:30]  They don't want to hear that drivel more than once a week.  They don't want to hear it once a week.  For some reason...  I don't know.  What has he got?  Naked pictures of CBS executives?  And speaking of radio geniuses...  What?  I don't even know what she's talking about there.  Yeah, she's upset that we're on the air in afternoon drive, yet she doesn't listen to us.  She's never heard us.  According to this posting, I cannot bring myself to listen to it.  And Vin's only on once a week.  She makes sense. 
[02:30:00]  You ever see on the Discovery Channel vultures fighting over a piece of meat in the Serengeti?  Naked!  Naked!  Naked!  That's Lynn Samuels.  Annoying.  Oh, Lewis!  Crotch rat.  Hey, Lewis.  Dudes, I can't believe the day has come when I have to rail on Anthony like I do on stairs.  Anthony, I can't believe you're effing talking about that giant twat after you just had friggin' 
[02:30:30]  babes playing Hunt Down the Cherry.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I'm standing here at attention, the little commandos doing the, you know, the one-eyed shuffle,  and suddenly he crawls up my ass because you mentioned Lynn Samuel.  I didn't even think about that, Lewis.  What's wrong with you?  You're totally right.  I see your point.  You brought the show to a crashing halt.  Come on.  Don't ever mention Lynn Samuels.  We're junk people.  I don't start Nadia Hilton. 
[02:31:00]  You can watch the little turtle crawl back into the shower.  Here's Lynn Samuels.  We're going to have Nadia Hilton in her back door on the show.  Opie, do me a favor.  When he starts talking about old bitches, that type is my old son.  Thank you, Lewis.  Thank you, Lewis.  Take care, dudes.  She's got to have a point.  She's got a great, great face, too.  Perfect face for radio.  Yes.  Lynn Samuels.  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:31:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Big vulture head laying into a hyena's carcass.  Ah!  You're upset because you're...  I don't even know if she's on the air anymore.  Dan, is there...  Once a week?  Is there anyone else in the New York market that likes Opie and Anthony?  No, and they're all coming out of the woodwork now,  saying how much we blow, and they don't listen to us.  How could you not listen and not like us?  Shouldn't you listen and then...  I don't know.  Watch out.  She'll peck your eyes out. 
[02:32:00]  Here comes Lynn.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Big vulture.  Yeah.  Let's go to Charlie.  Charlie!  Suck it!  Charlie!  Hey, O.A.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, look what you guys did to me again.  Driving home in my van.  You guys are the best, man.  All right.  We want to hear from, like, the 13-year-old boys.  That was hilarious.  Hey, a little early.  What I learned today?  Yeah.  I really can't listen to you guys when you're doing this and driving a van.  All right.  I got to pull over. 
[02:32:30]  Hey, thank you, Charlie.  You guys are the greatest, man.  All right.  Spaz Cam is up again.  They're making the Vag Elvis.  The Vag Elvis is being made.  Vag Elvis.  All right.  Let's go to Kevin on Line 9.  Kevin, you're next on N.E.W.  How are you?  Oh, and A.  Good afternoon, gentlemen.  I've got to tell you this.  I'm cruising across Bronx on my way home like I do every day.  Chuckie Carroll alongside me with a big homemade O&A written on the back doors.  We stop in the middle of the cross Bronx, hold the traffic so I can give him some stickers. 
[02:33:00]  The guy's excited.  He's got a video camera.  He's taping wow as anything he can out the window.  He just killed me with that.  Oh, cool.  Lynn Samuels.  Yeah.  I wouldn't know.  All right.  Terrific.  Talk to you later, guys.  Too bad.  Thanks, man.  Very good.  All right.  Don't forget to watch Jay Moore tonight on FX.  Action comes back to TV starting tonight.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to see those lost episodes. 
[02:33:30]  Well, yeah.  They're going to do the whole series, Ron, including all the episodes that did not air originally.  Yeah, because Fox couldn't run it.  They needed that Wendy Love Hewitt show that was on there.  Oh, boy.  That's a keeper.  But take Jay's show off.  It was mildly entertaining, so it had to be removed from the airwaves.  Mildly.  It was critically acclaimed.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone was digging the show.  And then all of a sudden, they just yanked it on us.  Seth, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You guys are the only thing that actually makes puberty good.  Yes, puberty pretty much, for the most part, really sucks because you're just always thinking 
[02:34:00]  about getting laid, but it's the hardest thing to do at that age.  So, yeah, we just offer you a little pressure relief valve.  You know, that's what our show is.  Yeah.  And one thing, guys.  Yeah.  Ask syndication now.  Let's try getting spaz mental health now.  All right.  Thank you, Seth.  And the other one?  Yeah.  Thank you.  You're an LD school.  Maybe spaz should be there, not me.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to James.  James, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, Owen.  Hey.  I'm 14, and I wanted to tell you, thank you so much for the spaz camp. 
[02:34:30]  Please, Seth.  Well.  Oh, no.  Because allegedly stealing them from unknown sources, you know, it's a lot easier to hook  up.  All right, James.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  They actually weren't nude women.  It was all done at Industrial Light and Magic with the magic blue screen photography they  used in Star Wars, I'll be.  They were computer-generated women. 
[02:35:00]  And that was actually the Holland Tunnel.  Yeah.  That was it.  Frank.  Opie and I were just throwing cherries in front of a blue screen.  Right.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, hey.  I'm 14.  I just wanted to tell you guys, the spaz camp is the greatest thing ever.  I love you guys.  Yeah.  Tell all your friends.  Free porno on the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, I can see Vag Elvis.  Dude, I'm looking at the camera.  It's Vag Elvis.  And even through the camera from a distance, I see the king.  The king of crotch and roll. 
[02:35:30]  I see that, yes.  And it looks like he's got a mohawk.  John.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Guys, so far today, I learned that with radio like this and the spaz camp once just isn't  enough.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, look.  Sean from Putnam County checking in.  Guys, right outside the studio.  And look, it's Vag Elvis.  It's the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Why don't we tilt the camera a little closer so we get a nice close-up of Vag Elvis before 
[02:36:00]  we head out there of Vag Elvis.  Vag Elvis, everyone.  Vag Elvis.  We still have the clip from the 55-Gallon Drum Challenge, the last clip, Anthony.  Should we play that and then go outside and check out Vag Elvis?  And finish up with Vag Elvis?  Yeah, we'll give some of the listeners a chance to view it on the spaz cam and then  we'll go out there.  All right.  Uh, no, it's up here.  Vag Elvis.  Vag Elvis, everyone. 
[02:36:30]  Keep talking, man.  I got to find some.  Why don't they hold the floor right in?  But I can't help being in a woman's crock.  Ah, shoot.  I learned that Vag Elvis is an outlet for sexual tension in pubescent boys everywhere.  Our show is like a helping hand.  Wow, that's Vag Elvis, all right.  Vag Elvis.  Oh, there he is.  It looks like Vag Fred Flintstone. 
[02:37:00]  Doesn't it look like Vag Fred Flintstone?  Yeah, it does.  Hey, Barney, I'm a Vag.  Fake Fred.  Wow, look at that.  A close-up of Vag Elvis with the two girls ready to work on his hair.  Yeah, tell him to hold on a minute.  Why don't we play this last clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge, and we'll end the show outside the studio, Anthony, okay?  Okay, terrific.  So much going on.  Trying to keep it all organized here.  You can see video clips from the 55-gallon drum challenge at foundrymusic.com. 
[02:37:30]  This is the last clip we'll play, we promise.  This is when the girls just started losing it, when we started throwing in all sorts of bugs,  including the grand finale, which was the hissing cockroaches, Anthony.  I'm reading some of the instant feedback, Opie.  Yeah.  And 15 and spanking it, once is saying, Vag Elvis, is it me, or does he have an S-eating grin on?  Little play on words. 
[02:38:00]  Very funny.  Okay, here's the last clip from the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Girls in the barrels, getting ready to be attacked by bugs.  All right, Anthony, that was the final clip of the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Screaming was just great.  Wendy was completely freaked out.  She couldn't even talk.  Yeah.  I mean, she was hyperventilating.  She sounded like the Blair Witch thing, where she was like,  Wait till you see the video clips from that event on foundrymusic.com, 
[02:38:30]  because you see the barrel shaking and stuff.  It's really freaky.  Steve's going to be putting clips up from the 55-gallon drum challenge.  The rest of the week, so if it's not up there yet, just keep checking back at foundrymusic.com.  We're playing Elvis in the background, Anthony,  because we're outside the studio now to finish the radio show today.  And Vag Elvis is on the blue tarp.  Vag Elvis is on the blue tarp.  Oh, my God.  It looks like a cross between Vag Elvis and Fred Flintstone, doesn't it?  It has a little Fred Flintstone to it. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, he certainly does.  What did she say?  He's got an ad.  Actually, it looks like a vagimus.  Yeah, that part could be used for my neck skin.  Yeah, baby.  Vag diamonds.  Oh, very nice.  That's good.  I like it.  Vag Elvis.  And it does resemble the king.  The king.  Very good.  And what do you do with Vag Elvis after he's on...  You know, you only have the pictures and it gets eaten, it's gone, so... 
[02:39:30]  They get to suck his face.  You get to suck his face.  Stick it to him.  All right, well...  Sable's going to show everyone why she did so bad at the SATs, Anthony.  Yeah.  You're not married, right?  You're married.  You're not, right?  Neither one of us is married at this moment in time.  Picture taken on either side, next to the job.  Oh, that'll be okay.  Oh, no, that'll be okay.  I'm thinking pending litigation.  And I'm thinking...  It keeps me from doing anything.  And I'm thinking about running for political office. 
[02:40:00]  Yes, and that type of picture.  After my radio career, so...  Picture could ruin any political aspiration.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  All right, so why don't we get the festivities going?  We got Nadia from NadiaHilton.com.  Let me get the plugs in.  We have a little lick, so he turns into Vag Corky.  Just distort him.  We got Sable Minx with an X.com.  And, of course, Kayla, that doesn't have a website, but she has a nice new hairdo today.  Wait, wait.  I got something.  Just get rid of enough of the frosting at the top of his head so the under part comes through 
[02:40:30]  and he looks like JFK.  I thought we were all having fun.  We're having a great time.  What?  Every time something happens when we're having fun.  He needs that like he needs a hole in there.  All right.  Let's go down the field, Mike, Anthony.  Down the field, Mike.  Down to the field is O.J.  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  They just took his hair off. 
[02:41:00]  He's bald, Elvis.  He's bald, Elvis.  Oh, my God!  That's pretty funny.  I'm Elvis.  That's Elvis.  That's pretty good.  Let's just take out one eye.  Okay.  Take out an eye.  There we go.  I could take out an eye.  Taking out an eye?  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  Yeah.  Wow.  Is there a point to this?  Absolutely not, Elvis.  Besides the obvious.  You're looking for any type of sense to be made of this. 
[02:41:30]  All right.  Just make it short.  Look in the wrong spot.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, uh...  Hey, ready?  Yep.  We're ready.  No.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  Let's go down to...  Kind of looks like now when you used to take Silly Putty and pick up the comics and stretch  it.  There it goes.  Let's go down to Jim Gray.  Jim Gray.  On the field.  On the field.  Well, I don't think that was part of Elvis there.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:00]  I don't remember Elvis having the chocolate chip.  At one point, when they removed Elvis's mouth, he suddenly had lips like Abner Lee.  We can't just have a good time in here.  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time? 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  That's something.  Yes.  All right.  Well, I don't know.  Well, unfortunately, Elvis is...  Elvis is gone.  Elvis is gone.  Elvis has left the badge.  Yes.  He's done.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Big hand.  Big hand.  That's nice.  Bravo, Anthony.  Bravo.  Let's hear it for the ladies.  Yes.  Nadia.  Beautiful job, girls.  Sable Minx with an X.com.  She just did her first porno.  And Kayla.  Kayla.  Kayla. 
[02:43:00]  Just me.  All right.  Well, we got a...  What?  How about that?  Okay.  If I come back, I'll have a website.  Cool.  And these guys are taking pictures and stuff that they're going to give to us eventually  for our website.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, look.  They're all snuggled up at each other.  Very cute.  Hey.  Look at me.  Hey, she's winking at me.  Hey, there you go.  Thank you.  All right.  And why don't we go back into the studio and play a quick round of what did we learn on the  M&A show?  What an educational program.  We'll let the ladies clean up.  This was like the old show Zoom. 
[02:43:30]  It was so educational today.  Oh, my God.  You running over to the mic there, Ralph?  There we go.  We're back in the studio.  What a day, huh?  What a day.  This was like the Learning Channel, Zoom, and Sesame Street all wrapped up into one.  Wow.  I'm looking at this fast cam and...  God, we're going to get thrown in jail. 
[02:44:00]  I swear to God.  Oh, boy.  All right, Anthony.  Well, let's go to the phones and play what did we learn on the O&A show today.  212-757-1027.  Angelo, what's up?  What's up, O&A?  It's Angelo from Queens.  Just wanted to say that what I learned today was that Elvis is from Gashville, Tennessee.  Over and out, precious.  Very good.  Law from Jersey.  I learned today that the fast cam does not live up to his name.  This thing actually does its job. 
[02:44:30]  What I learned today, King Gimp was batting cleanup for the Yankees last night.  What did we learn?  I learned that even Tony Soprano's dead mother can hit a home run.  Dan from Hoboken, I learned Vital Limo's phone number is...  Oh, no, wait.  I didn't.  Anthony learned that the canoe driver was knocked off his canoe because of Opie's cherry throw.  That's pretty true, man.  I learned that NAW is your one-stop pop for free porn. 
[02:45:00]  Let's go to the phones here.  Let's talk to John.  There's a lovely picture on the fast cam of all the ladies.  John, what's going on?  Hey, I'm 28, and the fast cam's still awesome.  See?  There you go.  Fun for all ages.  Thank you, buddy.  Thanks.  All right.  Let's go to Keith on line nine.  Keith, what did you learn today?  Opie, you guys are the best.  I learned that Tom Carvel released a new ice cream player today.  Bungie the Whale Eye. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, that's a good one.  I didn't think of that one.  You guys suck.  Thanks.  That's why it's the most interactive radio show in America.  We need your help.  I learned that the Opie and Anthony show is the best way around your parents' internet tracking software when you're 12.  Badge Elvis.  Badge Elvis.  It looks like tender London broil.  I learned that spandex and miniskirts are not for everyone. 
[02:46:00]  I learned that it's okay to laugh at deaf people as long as they're not looking at you.  See how much everyone learned?  Babe Ruth learned that he hit a home run against the Sox last night, even though he's been dead for over 40 years.  All right.  Anyone else with anything good here? 
[02:46:30]  I'm reading through them.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, you're next on NEW.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Listen, I'm sticking to my story.  You guys make puberty fun.  And that's why today I learned how to get some good nudity without the fear of prosecution or being grounded.  So, guys, all I got to say is thank you very much for syndication.  When syndication lines get funny again, I'm sticking to that.  Later.  That was pretty good.  Okay.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, how are you today?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned O&A can turn pornography into comedy. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, we turn pornography into comedy.  Yeah, I also learned why Vince Skelson's show is called Idiot's Delight for obvious reasons.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When syndication, when Anthony's in a limo driver gets out the goddamn number already.  Hang it up.  Steve from Long Island.  I learned that Tabitha doesn't wear panties to work.  What I learned, never, never, never lick the cream from...  Oh, never mind.  Dan from Hobo can learn that the skinny Vagelvis is better than the fat Vagelvis. 
[02:47:30]  Silent Bob from Jersey.  I learned something today, but I can't remember anything earlier than 20 minutes ago.  I learned the new starting lineup for the Yanks.  Anthony is on second base.  Stephen Hawkins is the DH.  And Helen Keller won't be listening to the game on the radio.  Let's go to Lewis.  Lewis, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned a few things today, guys.  I learned that hello cherry pie takes on a whole new meaning. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  I learned that ice cream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream is the new Opie and Anthony  theme.  Yes.  And I learned that Spaz is still the dumbest F that ever lived.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you, Lewis.  Take care.  I can't even say this guy's name or where he says he's from, but he learned that the  Spaz cam updates at 15 strokes per second.  Jake from Jersey.  I learned that Anthony can go take a leak without Reagan calling in. 
[02:48:30]  That is good.  Wow, boy.  That is very good.  There's a faithful list.  We love the obscure references.  And that's brilliant, Jake.  Cecil B.  Cecil B.  DeMille checking in from On Location.  Thanks for turning down the lights, gentlemen.  I learned that slowly but surely you guys are working your way into pop culture and it's  pissing a certain morning show host off.  I learned how ONA will make the front page of the New York Post. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Page three again today.  Page three today.  We're working on it.  We're trying to get to the front page.  That will be the end of the ONA show, but what the hell?  I learned I mismade comedy that wasn't even funny 100 years ago.  Let's see.  I'm trying to go through all the instant feedback.  I learned that the next time I see a 13-year-old buying Kleenex in the store, he's actually stocking  up for the ONA show.  I learned there's a hatcher wound on the Spaz cam. 
[02:49:30]  I learned women can get their cherry back if they visit your show.  No bones from Jersey.  I learned that my DSL connection finally paid off.  Yeah.  A lot of people happy with their DSLs and cable modems today.  Yeah.  I think we're done.  Yeah, that's about it.  Very educational.  I think we're done, Anthony.  You want to give out some concert tickets?  What the hell?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, we'll give the ladies a plug in a second here.  Do they want to come in and say hi real fast?  Why don't we give out some tickets, Anthony? 
[02:50:00]  Tenth caller right now at 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll win a pair of tickets to see.  Ready for this, Anthony?  Yes.  Iron Maiden, Queensryche, and Rob Halford, August 5th, at the Garden.

Well, you guys did a great job today.  You guys got to do that, like, at one of our road shows or something.  Oh, my God.  People would lose their minds.  We have to sign ten of these for people who call in, and you can give them up.  Nadia's going to sign, like, just have her sign them, and we'll, like...  Limited edition, people.
