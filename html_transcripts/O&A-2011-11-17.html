<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Little Jimmy engaging in their characteristically vulgar banter, promoting their "Thanks for Nothing Day" event at the Hard Rock Cafe.  They then launched into a cynical discussion of the Occupy Wall Street protests, using highly offensive language to describe the protestors and their actions.  This included commentary on a man arrested for threatening Macy's with a Molotov cocktail and a desire for police to use force against protestors. The conversation veered into tangents: Opie offering his couch to a woman with "big tits,"  discussion of a White House shooting, and speculation about the John Liu investigation.  They contrasted Occupy Wall Street unfavorably with the Tea Party, criticizing the protestorsâ€™ lack of focus and methods using derogatory terms.  A caller, Dave, a teacher, shared his struggles with rising commute costs and MTA issues, leading to a broader discussion about the middle class and economic inequality, with Opie and Anthony expressing mixed opinions while defending their financial success using vulgar language.  Financial details about their personal taxes and expenses were also shared.  The Penn State child sexual abuse scandal was discussed with cynical and vulgar commentary. The show ended the initial segment by describing their planned Thanksgiving play and related activities for the Hard Rock Cafe event, concluding with a sexually suggestive audio advertisement.

The next segment began with a discussion about a lawyer, possibly Joe Amidola, allegedly showering with and "fooling around" with jocks, followed by an equally inappropriate discussion involving a 10-year-old and "horseplay."  The conversation then shifted to horses' anatomy, shoeing horses, and a comedian/veterinarian's story about a horse kicking a nail into a man's mouth.  Tim Tebow was criticized, referred to as "Jesus," for his perceived apathy towards world problems. The conversation continued with a discussion of a lawyer allegedly impregnating a 16 or 17-year-old emancipated minor, and a caller, Jason from Detroit, inquired about potential evidence destruction in the Jerry Sandusky scandal.  The hosts discussed emancipated minor celebrities including Macaulay Culkin, Bijou Phillips, and Frances Bean Cobain, playing a recording of Frances Bean Cobain's outburst at a concert. A long anecdote from Penn Jillette about Kreskin's magic tricks was played, involving Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. The hosts then promoted their Hard Rock Cafe show, mentioning guests Voss and Bobby Kelly, a mashed potato eating contest, and a Thanksgiving skit, detailing plans for live reads and commercial breaks. The segment concluded with discussion of Rich Voss' briefcase of ex-girlfriend photos, Opie's son meeting Santa Claus, jokes about Voss' gambling, Jim Norton's marital issues, and Patty's physical characteristics.  The show then transitioned to a live segment from the Hard Rock Cafe.


The Hard Rock Cafe segment heavily featured a mashed potato eating contest, with crude jokes about a Starbucks employee's 401k. Rich Voss and Bob Kelly joined in studio, their appearances becoming the subject of jokes.  Three audience members were selected for the contest based on stereotypical assumptions about their ethnicity and weight, leading to further ethnic and weight-based humor. The contest itself was chaotic, culminating in one contestant vomiting after seeing a graphic image, rewarded with $100 by Opie. This was followed by a karaoke competition, with an actress from South Carolina and a contestant named Jordan becoming targets of suggestive and insulting comments.  The overall tone remained extremely crude, sexually suggestive, and filled with ethnic and weight-based jokes.


The Hard Rock Cafe broadcast continued with the karaoke contest, culminating in a vote between "Strutter" and Jordan. A crudely offensive Thanksgiving play, featuring Opie, Anthony, Roland, Stalker Patty, Rich Vosch, Bobo, Chip, and others, was performed, including homophobic slurs, racist jokes, and sexually explicit content.  The vomiting contestant's incident was again highlighted, with Pat Duffy consuming the vomit-contaminated mashed potatoes. Pat Duffy also made a toast to his father's 60th birthday. The show concluded with Santa Claus' appearance, further chaotic interactions with audience members, and the giveaway of Opie and Anthony t-shirts.


The post-show segment focused on interactions with Pat Duffy, Matt, and Sal, current interns.  Duffy's return was highlighted, comparing him favorably to the current intern Matt, focusing on Matt's perceived lack of initiative and willingness to perform menial tasks.  Ricky, another incompetent former intern, was also discussed.  A surprise return of Ricky for Sam Roberts was revealed. Travis, another former intern, participated, comparing Ricky and Matt. Matt's behavior was criticized, culminating in insults.  Interactions with audience members, including the karaoke and mashed potato contest winners, were included, with crude humor and profanity continuing throughout. The broadcast concluded with a summary of events and mention of upcoming guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Being from satellites in space down to you every single day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  You're dang over here, don't listen to dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Morning. 
[00:01:00]  Morning.  Morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  What a special day.  Yes it is.  It sure is.  Didn't we just do one of these? 
[00:01:30]  It's our thanks for nothing day.  It's going to be so much fun at the Hard Rock.  Thanks for nothing.  Thanks for nothing.  I think we picked a perfect name.  Yes.  As in Sirius XM, thanks for nothing.  Thanks for nothing.  And we pass it along to the listener.  I hope the Occupy Wall Street shindigs, fandango, hijinks and shenanigans doesn't interfere with our wonderful time at the Hard Rock. 
[00:02:00]  Well, we're going to be occupying the Hard Rock Cafe.  Yes.  At what, 8 o'clock?  8 o'clock.  It's going to be great.  So we should leave now, Sam, I'm thinking.  It doesn't take that long to get there.  Isn't it about a half hour or so away?  I walked over there yesterday just to check.  Yeah.  Four minutes is how long it took.  Yeah, but there's a whole Occupy movement happening today that could get in our way between here and there.  So we just want to be responsible and make sure we get there.  We'll factor in for seven and a half then. 
[00:02:30]  So we should leave at what, 615, 620?  No, that would be right about now.  Well, that's what I was getting at.  I'm thinking more 740-ish.  We should just say hi, and we should get the fuck out of here.  Well, then what would be the point of saying hi?  Just to say, hey, we're here, and we're still doing the Hard Rock Cafe today.  And don't go anywhere.  Yeah, don't go anywhere.  See you in an hour and 45 minutes.  Well, think about it.  If there was a replay, people would think, oh, boy, they canceled.  I better go home.  Right.  But now that they're hearing our live voices, they know the gig is on, and now we did our jobs, and we could head over there. 
[00:03:00]  And they'll stay tuned for the next hour and 45 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we could have a nice little breakfast.  Well, again, I mean, I feel like we'll do a show here, and then, you know, 730, 740, we'll walk over to the Hard Rock.  So you want us to do a show before the show?  Yeah, this is a show before the show.  Show before the show.  You think that people would stay tuned just knowing their heroes were eating and relaxing?  Exactly.  Jimmy, you look great in a hat.  Thank you.  I don't wear them that often.  Oh, look at you.  But that's cold out, so.  Dave's old porn hat. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  That's nice.  You look like a completely different person.  I know.  I look at myself in the mirror.  I'm like, I just don't wear them that often.  That's all you would need to go on the lam, is put a hat on.  Yeah.  You should wear a fedora.  No, I can't pull off.  I can barely pull off a cap.  Only because I think Dave's old porn is airing tonight, actually, so I wanted to support the cause.  And it was freezing out.  Is that tonight?  I believe so, Thursday night, yeah.  Goddamn, one click of the mouse, and there goes the phones.  The phones just left.  Thank God we're not doing a show, Sam.  We're going to be in trouble right now.  We're doing a show as we speak.  Well, not really. 
[00:04:00]  This is on the air.  As we speak.  We do a show every day.  We're pre-gaming.  So Occupy Wall Street's going to take over the city.  Yeah.  Their plan is to literally today Occupy Wall Street, try to shut down the stock exchange.  That's impossible.  The city is saying this will not happen.  Of course not.  They will do whatever it takes to balance the freedom of speech issue and freedom to protest  with the need for a city to function as a working city. 
[00:04:30]  And what else they're going to do after they try to shut down Wall Street is occupy the subways.  So they're going to be annoying people that are just trying to get to work.  That thing that they really don't have much of a clue.  Well, more importantly, they're going to annoy more of the 99%.  Right.  The 99% that choose to continue to work.  They take the subway.  The 1% will not be in the subway. 
[00:05:00]  The 1% doesn't take the subway, you dumbbells.  So what are they doing?  So they're disrupting people that would probably be for the cause, or some of them.  That's not a way to get your numbers up.  No, I think this will alienate them even more.  What you should be doing is hanging out by the helicopter pads, some of those private airports  that we don't even know about.  There you go.  Where those jets come flying in.  Limo services, that type of thing.  Yeah.  That makes a little more sense. 
[00:05:30]  But they're going to be in the subways, tying up the subways and tying up the streets.  And then it all culminates with a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.  Oh, I heard they were trying to shut down the bridge.  Well, they say it's a walk.  Well, I guess that would shut down the bridge.  If they said they were going to shut down the bridge, then the police would put the kibosh  on it immediately.  Correct.  They say it's a walk across, but they're planning on something like 10,000 people, they said.  No, my literature says that they're going to shut down the bridge.  Well, if they try to shut down the bridge, the police will take action. 
[00:06:00]  More than one, too, by the way.  More than one bridge.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But I guess they can't say that in a public forum, like you're saying.  Just like that gentleman that started yelling, burn down Macy's.  What, a done with a Molotov cocktail?  Yeah, Molotov cocktail, and they arrested that guy.  What a dick.  He's 29.  He's almost 30.  What are you doing?  Some dummy was on a video yesterday, and the video kind of went viral, and he was talking  about the city's going to burn, and then he was talking to somebody about how a Molotov 
[00:06:30]  cocktail's going to look, sailing into Macy's.  And the cop said, well, you know what?  We have a specific threat with a specific place and time, and that has to be acted upon.  You think there's going to be some good violence today?  I can only hope the NYPD gets a little loose on the leash and is able to maybe crack a few  heads open.  I think the protesters, they're a little ornery today as well. 
[00:07:00]  Are they?  Yeah.  They're cranky from not sleeping in the Zuccotti Park.  Man, they shut that thing down.  Yeah, it's getting cold.  It's rainy.  They're not allowing tents or sleeping bags, so the park is pretty much empty.  Where have they been?  Like, where have they been the last couple nights?  Where are they going?  It's kind of like cockroaches.  They go home.  You turn the light on.  Scattering, right?  Where the fuck do the cockroaches go?  I don't know.  I'm from my apartment to any woman with big tits who's open-minded and would like a place  to stay.  I have a very comfortable apartment, and I'll be glad to sleep on the couch. 
[00:07:30]  Oh.  Absolutely.  While you do.  Yes.  My bed will be empty.  While you smush your big bosoms in my face because there's not enough room for both of  us on the couch.  On the sofa.  On the sofa.  Some of the area churches have allowed some of the protesters in.  Some?  Yeah.  Some.  Well, that's not fair because I never understood this about the churches.  They locked their doors at night.  And in the old days of the church, if you're a religious person or learned a little history... 
[00:08:00]  Or watched the movies.  Well, watched the movies.  The churches were very important for the people that were down and out.  Yeah.  But in modern day society, they don't want the smelly bums in their churches, so they  locked the doors.  But the smelly bums are the ones that need the most help.  And they don't want rapes and robberies.  Huh?  And they don't want rapes and robberies, which happen when they leave these doors open.  Yeah, but if you have a church, what you have to do is then have maybe some security  people in there as well, and you open your fucking doors.  Because that's what the whole church is about.  Helping people.  Helping real people.  Huh? 
[00:08:30]  Helping real people.  Well, that's what they've decided.  But I don't think Jesus separated who was real and who wasn't.  Yeah.  That's why it's all bullshit.  Times are different when Jesus was around.  But now they're opening up the church doors for the protesters?  Yeah, yeah.  And the protesters kind of stay in there overnight.  I think that'll end pretty quickly, though, once they realize what assholes they are.  Even Jesus doesn't like the protesters.  You don't think Jesus?  Jesus is going to say, I cast ye out.  I cast ye out to follow Satan. 
[00:09:00]  Are you bothered that someone could take a pop shot at the White House?  Bulletproof glass.  True.  Who did it?  Oh, they got him.  Some fucking wacko looks like an Occupy guy.  He's kind of just some scraggly guy with some past problems.  Of course.  Another fucking one that should have been put down at birth.  You know, the Occupy movement in Washington is much different than other cities.  Yeah.  The clientele is a bit more on the upside. 
[00:09:30]  You know what?  I think they should absolutely take away this guy's license to own a gun.  Oh, that's right.  He doesn't have one.  Oh, see, he wasn't paying attention to the rules.  How has that happened?  There's laws in place.  Why wasn't he paying attention to those laws?  Jackasses.  It's silly, right?  It's so silly.  Was it a rifle or a...  It was a rifle.  Was he trying to kill the president?  Was he just shooting at the building?  He was just shooting at the White House.  The president wasn't even there. 
[00:10:00]  Shortly before he allegedly fired shots that smashed a White House window.  Bulletproof glass.  Never went through.  Two shots.  Bam, bam.  And then...  That guy should do fucking 40 years for that.  Yeah?  Yeah, if you shoot at the White House, you should never get out of jail.  You can shoot at anybody's house.  Nah, but the White House is a symbolic attack on the country.  Oh, is that what it is?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, all right.  What kind of time will he do, you think?  I don't know, because of course he's crazy.  Is this special circumstances?  He's a little kooky.  You start thinking maybe he's a terrorist or something, so you slam some other charges on him? 
[00:10:30]  Dude, Hinkley's getting out for visits and stuff, and he shot Reagan.  Yeah, I know.  You kidding?  That's been, what, 30 years?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Is John Liu in trouble?  John Liu, yeah, there's something going on.  This motherfucker.  Did he enter a tiny genitals contest and win it?  John Liu was the one that was aggressively going after any radio personality that would 
[00:11:00]  do like, oh, I get the Chinese food.  You know, you make like a wacky Asian accent, and he would jump on the shows.  Well, he was the guy that got, what's his name, fired?  J.V. and Elvis.  J.V. and Elvis, and he certainly was going after other radio shows for doing the stereotypical  Asian voice.  Nice to see he's an ethical guy.  Liu Donor stung by FBI.  Someone told me last night he was arrested, but I don't see that in the Oracle.  No, that would be huge.  But they're looking into his dealings?  Yep.  Nice. 
[00:11:30]  Who do I help you get in trouble?  Fuck yeah.  He's a cocksucker.  Doesn't understand fucking, uh...  He's an asshole.  Humor.  Fucking stereotype humor.  I think he understands it.  He just doesn't, he likes to use it to his advantage to jump on, to march to.  Yeah, stop there, because I was thinking exactly what I wanted to say there.  I was going to say he doesn't understand anything.  You don't think that guy has told some off-color jokes in his house when he's having these little  parties, things like that?  I don't know how this shit works.  Little get-togethers.  A get-together.  So hopefully that'll end badly for John Liu. 
[00:12:00]  I'm serious.  He doesn't get it.  Yeah.  This fucking Wall Street thing's got me so annoyed.  Why?  It's just annoying.  It's just annoying.  Why?  It's just annoying to me.  It doesn't affect you.  No, it does.  It doesn't bother you at all.  You're all safe and tucked away nice on Long Island.  It does.  I hope it affects the city.  I work here.  It affects you guys.  All that money being spent on police overtime. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, but you don't care about us.  You care about how it affects you.  Well, no.  I care about the city I work in.  You don't care about me.  You're just worried that it might affect you directly?  Yeah, in some way, shape, or form.  Okay.  Do you care about me a little?  I care about Jimmy a little bit.  Yay.  No, it's just, it's the bigger picture here is not so much what they're doing directly.  It's just this overlying entitlement, stupidity, ignorance, all the things that go along with this. 
[00:13:00]  They just, you know, they have no goals.  They're just running around like children.  Yeah.  Tired of it.  Go home.  Yeah, but how does that affect you?  It affects my perception of humanity.  Like this, it really bothers you.  Yeah, it affects, it's not affecting me directly.  It affects my perception of people. 
[00:13:30]  It affects how I look at the local governments and how they're dealing with it.  And I'm disappointed in it.  And it affects how I think about the youth in this country and where we're heading because of it.  It's everything we've talked about in the past, about these softball games and baseball games, Little League, where everybody gets a trophy.  That's what this is all about.  This is the culmination of that policy. 
[00:14:00]  It's these people that feel that they are entitled to something because other people have it.  And instead of working for it and getting that victory in order to attain it, they just think it should be handed to them.  And that's what gets me.  It's the bigger picture.  Not just the literal fact that they're there and they're doing wacky stuff.  I think every generation, though, has a weird thing.  It's almost like every generation has their weird fucking teenage years of rebellion. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this is just this one.  Like, if it wasn't this from that trophy shit, which I do agree with, it would be something else.  They all want to be a part of something.  I don't know what it was in the 80s.  This is a big one, though.  We haven't seen anything like this in a while.  In our lifetime in general, we haven't seen like a rising up like this.  It's very unorganized, but it's not going away anytime soon.  I was watching the Vietnam and HD.  Yeah.  On history.  I saw a little of that.  Goddamn great. 
[00:15:00]  And watching the last couple of episodes, they showed a lot about what was going on in the United States at the time during Vietnam and the protests and stuff.  And it was still very focused.  You know, it was anti-war.  You know, let's stop the war.  This just doesn't have any focus.  You know, they're Occupy Wall Street.  What does it even mean?  And what do they want?  Like I said, they want a complete sweeping change of the way America works as a capitalist society. 
[00:15:30]  Is that what it is?  Do they want all the big wigs to be thrown out and have them elect new heads of companies from Zuccotti Park?  What the fuck are they looking for?  Well, a lot of people are asking that question.  I mean, the fringe protesters want the end of capitalism.  But that doesn't â€“ I don't think that represents all the protesters.  I'm not too sure about that.  Some of the protesters just want an easier commute. 
[00:16:00]  That's the problem.  They're all over the place.  And I think one of the biggest problems with the movement is the fringe players are really fucking it up and making people like yourself really frustrated, man.  But a singular purpose, though, you're right.  That's true.  The war was the war.  So no matter what happened, everybody knew what they were against.  And there was a face to it.  There was LBJ.  There was Nixon.  You know, they were able to say, hey, motherfucker, you got to do this in order for us to be satisfied.  There's no one person.  There's a collective. 
[00:16:30]  But â€“ yeah.  But this one, you can't just put your finger on it.  It isn't just an obvious war that's happening that's pissing off a lot of people.  I think if you put your finger on this, it has a lot to do with the middle class.  The middle class feels like they're being squished out of this entire society.  I think the middle class has always felt like they're getting shit on.  And in certain ways, yes, they are.  They absolutely are.  And in other ways, it's a lot of people not taking responsibility for themselves, getting themselves in a jam up. 
[00:17:00]  The middle class wants to be upper middle class.  The lower middle class wants to be middle class.  So they spend and live a little beyond their means, get into debt, and then when the shit starts crashing down, they're looking for someone to blame.  Well, yeah.  I mean, there's also corruption in government that I think more people are aware of.  They're absolutely aware of that.  If I wanted to protest anything, if I saw a protester saying this, I want an accountability of where our money goes when it's spent by the city and the federal government, where it goes. 
[00:17:30]  What happens to our tax dollars that the MTA is broke and has to raise rates and nothing gets fixed?  And where is that money going?  Did you get the call about the new tax thing we got?  Uh, yeah, have fun with that.  That's a city tax.  That wasn't you?  Nope.  I'm only paying $45,000 in property taxes and school taxes, so it doesn't matter to me. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, I mean, yeah.  You own one?  Yeah.  About nine grand.  How do you know?  I talk.  Well, that ain't bad you know about my business.  Because I was trying to determine if I had to pay it also.  Yeah, another nine grand out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere, really.  Like, all of a sudden, paperwork comes, oh, by the way, now you have to pay this.  You're still not doing your part, though, by the way. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, I, and I agree with you on that part.  I absolutely, when you start looking at, you know, how much tax we're paying, it's un-fucking-believable.  And it used to be just federal and state, you'd be like, wow, I pay a lot of federal and state.  That's just part of it now.  When people go, oh, you're not doing your share, it's like, well, I pay federal and state, and now look at this multitude of other shit.  They've piled on top of everything from my cell phone to fucking gas to my tires to the fucking commute. 
[00:19:00]  It takes the fucking piss out of you.  I just, I have a lot of, I have a lot of people in my family that's in the middle class, and I can't put my finger on it, but I know they're just having a really tough time trying to fucking make, you know, ends meet, you know?  When we were growing up, you didn't have to have both parents fucking working.  Started with that, where both parents had to go back to work, and then for some reason that's not even good enough to have a, have a life.  Well, what's the solution?  I don't.  Getting the middle class to, uh.  And that's where you'll absolutely lose me. 
[00:19:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what the solution is.  Maybe something happens with this whole Occupy movement where it becomes more focused.  I don't know.  This, this, this, this, I don't see this movement doing any, it's so far away from what needs to really be done.  It's extremely radical right now.  I'm just hoping that maybe something like real, you know, comes of it.  Or maybe you punish people, like guys like Madoff, who do a lot of damage and they steal a billion dollars.  Fuck yeah.  Maybe you punish them a little harsher.  Maybe that you put a real deterrent in place because they don't have one. 
[00:20:00]  They go to minimum security jails.  And again, if they were, if he was being fucked in the mouth or in a horrible, horrible place, they would be less likely to do that shit.  And he did it because he knew he could get away with it for many, many years.  If he thought maybe he'll, he'll get away with it forever.  Yeah.  He's a smart guy.  And so he kind of knew the system if you think about it.  But they know, dude, even when they get caught and go to jail, they're not going to, funny we say that.  He's on TV now.  Look, the hardcore prison.  Let's go to Dave. 
[00:20:30]  Dave.  Guys, what's going on?  Hey Dave.  Dave from New York City.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi David.  Hey, Ed, I'm the, I called in a lot and a lot of the things that you're killing me right now, man.  I'm a teacher.  Uh-huh.  And I've worked my whole fucking life.  Child molester.  And, what?  I said, yeah, teacher, what?  All right, well, here's the thing.  I think you kind of nailed it.  And with things like the MTA, you know, when I was teaching in New York City, just recently, at the beginning of this year, 
[00:21:00]  they raised the subway 14%.  Yeah.  So, my commute from Westchester went up because I was taking the train in, and then I was taking the subway to get to the Upper West Side where I was teaching.  And my commute went from like $350 to just over $400 a month.  And I didn't do anything differently.  And I didn't see anything different in the MTA.  The subways weren't any cleaner. 
[00:21:30]  So, okay, wait, wait, wait now.  So, what did I say?  I was saying that I don't like the fact that the MTA and the city spends all this money and then has to raise rates on commuting and other things with zero accountability as to where this fucking money is going.  That's why I totally do agree with you.  But I think a lot of the times, you know, I hear Opie, too, is always, you know, Opie, you a lot of the times sympathize more with the middle class.  You know, and I appreciate that. 
[00:22:00]  I spent, I spent, I spent, hold on, I spent most of my life in the middle class to fuck lower middle class, you know.  And I was a bum.  And I come from a very, a very large family.  And I see it all around me.  And your point is a good one because things are going up all around us.  And then our stupid fucking bosses won't give any of us a raise to, to kind of like, you know, offset that.  And you're a guy who's doing the right thing.  You're not changing. 
[00:22:30]  You're not living beyond your means.  Right.  You just, you're staying in the same system you're in and you're just kind of getting fucked.  I could talk about New York City like this guy.  If you're commuting in, everyone knows that their commute has gotten a lot more expensive.  The bosses know that.  But they just looked all the way.  They're like, ah, well, you know, good luck to you.  You know, that's, that's what's frustrating.  But for me, like, you know, you guys have your things going on in the side too.  And where I've always agreed with not taxing the rich as heavily as people might want them to be taxed. 
[00:23:00]  Because I'm one of the people that do believe that people with more money are the ones creating the jobs.  You know, and it's frustrating to me for the most part.  And I don't want to, I'm not singing, you know, everybody's praises who's like, you know, ridiculously wealthy.  Look.  Because the system is also set up to protect their money as well.  But, you know, for people in the middle class to get screws so hard, you know, fuel, everything.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  I'm with Anthony. 
[00:23:30]  Like, you've really got to listen closely because there's a lot of point of views here swirling around.  And there's agreement, there's disagreement.  I agree with Anthony where I don't feel like people should be pointing the finger at me because I made something of myself.  Yeah.  But I'm all about, you know, taking a look at the system in general.  I think the system in general is really fucked up.  And that's what frustrates the hell out of me.  Yeah.  You know, but then when people turn their eyes on me like, well, fuck, you should be giving more.  That's where I'm in full agreement with Ant. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Don't lump me in with the same people as fucking Madoff and fucking, you know, the head of Exxon and shit like that.  I'm just a guy that got lucky and made good, and I don't want to be villainized for it.  Local boy who made good.  Right.  I'm not some fucking executive.  Of course I am.  You know, I think the fact that you were able to position yourself is a good thing.  I mean, you know, I appreciate that about your story.  You also touched on something about how people are entitled or feel this sense of entitlement. 
[00:24:30]  I completely agree with you, and I see it a lot of the times in schools, and I know a lot of other teachers on their way to work.  Listen, now, when I see kids whose parents have to bust their asses going to work every day, and they leave their kids in the care of other people or whatever because they've got two, three, four jobs, and their kids are suffering, you know?  And that's why I don't pay attention to any of these politicians when they fucking talk because they're all full of shit.  They are.  I mean, there's no reason that both parents should have to fucking work, but that's the point we got to. 
[00:25:00]  Yesterday, really quickly, I had to go to the east side of Manhattan just to get a haircut.  I go to this place I like, right?  I jump in a cab.  Usually I'll bike or walk, but it was a rainy day.  It cost me $15 in a cab one way, $15 back, $30 fucking bucks to do a chore in New York City.  Can I afford that?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  I'm not going to front, but then I start thinking, who the fuck can afford this, and how is this right? 
[00:25:30]  But the cabbies need their money, right?  But the cab driver doesn't even get a lot of that money.  No.  They added the syntax and the oil tax, the gas tax, all these little syntaxes to your cab fare, and that's for the owners of the fucking cab companies.  The working Joe that's behind the steering wheel doesn't even get a piece of that action.  Yeah, it's the price of gas, and then it's also the city jacks up the price to put a medallion on your car to make you a cab in New York City, 
[00:26:00]  so that they have to pay off like a fucking home loan.  But if I knew the cab driver, because obviously it's a shitty job, was getting more because I'm paying more, I can accept that.  But you know, they raised the fare with all these hidden fees, and the guy's not getting the money.  He's still getting the same shit.  But there's misappropriation of funds that are going on in this city and in this country at an astounding rate,  and that's what has to be really looked into. 
[00:26:30]  If there's one single thing that really has to be looked into, if you want to protest,  if you want to fucking delve into the problems in this country, look at the amount of waste that's going on,  and the complete fucking just skipping what your shoelace is untied that the public's doing  of not getting involved and realizing where this fucking money's going.  Yeah. Thank you, David.  Can I say one more thing about that misappropriation thing?  It's a perfect example as well.  When I was in the New York City public schools, a flash drive, like a thumb drive, 
[00:27:00]  would cost the schools almost $20.  And when I approached the assistant principal, because I was responsible for some of that stuff at my school,  like just my school, when I approached the assistant principal for, you know,  I said, look, I can get this thing for one-fourth the price.  He was like, well, we're forced to use this one vendor.  Yeah, of course.  And then, Jimmy, you always talk about Bloomberg.  These chancellors are scumbags.  Yep.  You know, they all have each other's hands in each other's pockets, 
[00:27:30]  and they're all looking out for self.  It's really messed up, and everybody fucking gets fucked.  Yeah.  And then you talk about why your taxes are going up.  Opie, it's not right.  Well, you know what?  The protests need to be happening.  This has got to be the revolution.  But that's why you've got to kind of listen to all the voices on the show,  because now I'm within an agreement with that where maybe if there was a focus,  all right, let's look at the fucking corruption of government,  then maybe other people would join this fucking movement.  But instead, they're going to disrupt the subways and the bridges 
[00:28:00]  when those people coming to work possibly would agree with the cause.  That's stupid.  Then you get into the stupid category again.  Thank you, sir.  Ant just talks about misappropriation of funds because he's a greedy cunt who will never be happy,  but thinks his money will buy him some joy.  Now, I'll be honest with you, Zeri, whatever your name was, Zeri on here, 
[00:28:30]  money does not buy you happiness.  I think that's been said before.  But it sure can take care of a lot of things that would make you miserable,  like sitting around toiling over how you're going to pay a bill.  Right.  That, you know, I don't have to feel sad because I can't pay a bill.  So that's why I'm there.  And I'm a greedy cunt.  I don't think I'm greedy at all.  I give a lot.  What do you contribute, Zeri? 
[00:29:00]  Huh?  What do you contribute?  Probably nothing.  So go fuck yourself.  And no, I won't bounce you.  I'll just let the room fucking hound you and pound you.  Eat you alive?  Yeah.  Jimmy, what do you got, buddy?  About what?  Yeah, I think Ant got this whole fucking OWS thing wrong.  I mean, I think people are down for a party and they're retarded.  But they're kind of the only people bringing attention to how badly the financial system is fucking. 
[00:29:30]  What are they bringing attention to, sir?  Because every time I see any one of them speaking, it sounds like psychobabble.  I can't disagree with you there.  I've seen the videos, but there are some people that they're talking about actual issues.  They're not all actual fucking hippie pot smoking, you know, nothing.  I wouldn't think they all are, but I've seen a large majority of these people, and I know the news tries to focus on the lunatics and stuff, but I have seen these people that are supposedly in charge and making, you know, policy for this movement. 
[00:30:00]  And them, too, they just have these unrealistic, wacky ideas and misplaced anger.  Well, what do you think about the Tea Party?  I mean, the Tea Party says a lot of the same things.  I mean, I don't know.  You're pissed off about how taxes are.  I mean, everyone.  I'll tell you about the Tea Party.  Let me explain the Tea Party very quickly to you. 
[00:30:30]  The Tea Party movement, especially during the midterm elections, they were focused on we do not want to elect in candidates that are going to increase our taxes, which pretty much pointed at the Democratic candidates that were up for re-election and saying we want the Tea Party candidates and the Republicans that don't want to raise taxes to be elected in.  So they protested peacefully with a singular goal as to not raise the taxes, and when the midterm elections came around, a lot of the Democrats that wanted to raise taxes were voted out. 
[00:31:00]  Republicans were voted in.  They lost their majority, and that's what their goal was, and that's what they achieved.  Now, this, I don't see any fucking legitimate goal, a nice focused beam that you can really get behind.  I don't know what they're doing.  Well, I mean, then you're just saying that their main lack is that they don't have any leadership, and if they had leadership, you're saying that you'd agree with what the... 
[00:31:30]  Not leadership as much as a goal.  You don't have to have leadership, but you have to have kind of a goal.  You have to have a focused point that people can say, oh, this is what they're protesting.  Oh, I get it.  No one gets it.  This guy's in shock.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I am.  Jerry, go ahead.  Welcome.  Jerry. 
[00:32:00]  Did you say $45,000 a year?  It's between $40,000 and $45,000 a year.  That's Beverly Hills, by the way.  I think that's what Beverly Hills is.  By the way, Nassau County pays higher taxes than Beverly Hills, because Nassau County is  the number one property tax county in the country.  In the country.  More importantly, this guy's in shock, because when you start throwing numbers out there,  but people don't like talking about their own personal finances ever.  No, no.  Yeah, you'd be surprised how much fucking money Ant pays, and I pay, and Jimmy pay. 
[00:32:30]  And I could move, but you know what?  It's a fine line between moving away from where I work, which is Manhattan, moving further  away, and there's equity in the fact that I get home in 30 minutes, as opposed to an hour  and a half commute, that would kill me.  And that's where the system takes advantage of the people as well.  I have a cousin that, his job's in Jersey.  He lives so fucking far out on Long Island because of exactly what you're saying. 
[00:33:00]  He can get more for his money, and he pays less taxes, but the sacrifice there, he added  probably an hour and a half onto his commute every fucking day.  Each way, by the way.  Each way.  Each way.  This is the system that is in place that is complete bullshit.  I would literally have a nervous breakdown.  That's why.  I do it to save my own fucking mentality.  Dude, our stupid jobs, I moved into the city.  I don't like the city.  Yeah.  I think I've made it pretty clear.  I want to be a suburb guy, but I couldn't take that fucking commute anymore. 
[00:33:30]  And we were only an hour and 15 away.  And now we're doing mornings, which is an easier commute, but I still say to myself,  no fucking way.  So I get hammered with another tax.  I have to pay city tax, state tax, and federal tax.  And now there's a new tax.  And a new tax that I was just hit up with.  You know, we don't talk about finances, but I'll say this.  I spend $50,000 a week on toast.  I had some damn good toast.  Damn, that's good toast.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, Ant, do you stop into your local high school and have your fucking chicken nuggets 
[00:34:00]  with the rest of the kids?  I really should, because the school tax is more than the property tax, than the actual  property tax for my home.  The school tax is more.  Which, by the way, forces you, maybe not yourself, but forces most people to continue working,  by the way.  Because you think you made it by buying a house and paying your mortgage.  And maybe you're lucky enough to even knock down your mortgage or pay the whole fucking  thing off.  The government is not done with you at that point. 
[00:34:30]  You're still paying fucking all sorts of other taxes.  Isn't it amazing that you can outright own your home, buy it, pay off your mortgage, yet  the government can take it away if you don't pay your taxes on it.  Right.  And then it's just, you lose everything.  It's not your house anymore.  All the equity you put in it, gone.  It's not yours anymore.  That's the shit we're talking about.  I live in a building in New York City.  I have to pay $2,500 a month for what, you might ask.  So a stupid guy opens the door for me every morning when I get home.  Wow. 
[00:35:00]  Wow.  I don't know what they do.  It's fucking corruption.  Every person in my building, look, I do very well for myself.  But even on this level, you're like, what the fuck?  Why am I paying $2,500 so they can fucking vacuum the hallways every other day?  And you've got to pay for security and this and that.  There's all these excuses, and it goes up every fucking year.  Oh, how about this also?  I pay all those taxes.  I live out on Long Island.  New York City has figured out a way to reach into my fucking pocket with something called  the commuter tax. 
[00:35:30]  See, I have to pay a commuter tax, even though I drive myself in and pay tax on my gas.  I pay the tolls.  You know, I pay local taxes that go toward repairing the streets and whatnot that I commute  in on.  Yet the city is taxing me to give the money to the MTA that I don't use because they can't  figure out how to fucking spend their money properly.  And then in the end, you know, they don't fix the roads, the subways properly, the bridges 
[00:36:00]  properly.  It's still a shitty commute where you're bouncing the whole way into the city.  Well, I wouldn't even know.  I don't take it, but I pay for it.  Right.  Yeah, but you've already built your own fucking highway to get into work.  I wish.  Wow, that'd be cool, man.  But you know what?  People would be out of my fucking way.  You know what?  People.  This is the shit I'm talking about.  And if this was part of the Occupy movement, that would be more of a fucking focus.  I mean, we're all...  In the end, I can afford all of it, yes.  But we're all getting fucking hammered, man. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, I mean, we live within our team.  And it just continues to go up.  And then the bosses ignore this shit and don't give anyone raises.  Yeah.  Look, we bitch all the time.  We're extremely underpaid at SiriusXM.  And that's going to come out at the end of this contract.  And if they do the right thing, we'll be here.  If not, I'm out.  Simple as that.  Black and white.  I'm out.  Because I know I'm completely underpaid here.  But there's other people around here that are extremely underpaid.  They can't fucking afford shit.  Shit, I remember waking up.  At least I can afford to still do what I do. 
[00:37:00]  But there are people that work...  I can only talk for what I see in front of me.  And here at SiriusXM, no one has had raises in a really long time as everything around them goes up.  Yep.  So they have to park further away from the building.  They have to do all these tricks.  Sometimes they have to get on a train an hour, hour and a half early because it's cheaper.  And the bosses just ignore all this shit.  Yeah, because you know why?  It's the other planets.  They look down at this one and point and fucking laugh.  What a joke. 
[00:37:30]  Maybe Ant should donate to charities or install solar panels so he can get tax cuts.  That's right.  Do you know what kind of...  Do you know you will never pay for solar panels?  The technology just isn't there right now.  If you put solar panels on your house, along with the tax break that you would get, it's not viable.  You dumb fuck.  This Zari guy just...  And as far as charities go, you don't know what I fucking give to.  You don't know what fucking charities I give to. 
[00:38:00]  So shut your fucking mouth.  You're a yapping useless fuck.  You're a burden.  You're a pariah.  You're a leech.  The Zari's really giving you the business.  I like this kid.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  Hey, Jimmy, when are you going to offer some free books?  Free books?  No way.  Oh, about what?  I don't know.  Did you always say when I'm going to offer some free books?  What?  No way.  Oh, this weekend in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  That's right.  Comedy zone.  Starting tonight or tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow night. 
[00:38:30]  And now I'm getting hammered on the $2,500 I have to pay just to live in the building.  My point with that asshole is really simple.  If I understood where the money was going, like Ant was just saying, then I would gladly  pay it.  I could open my own fucking door in and out of my stupid building, and that's about all  they do.  I don't know what else they do.  Every once in a while, if a package comes, they'll bring it upstairs for me.  Great.  Is that worth $2,500 a month?  Get the fuck out of here.  It comes to $2,500.  That's $30,000 a year. 
[00:39:00]  Plus the parking.  My parking is almost $500 a month.  So before I even do anything, $3,000 a month is gone.  It's gone.  And the workers in the building aren't getting that.  It's probably one, two fucking guys getting the money, really, if you think about it.  And that's where the fucking real problem is.  If it meant that these guys were living better, that work in my building, fine.  Fine.  But it drives me nuts, like Ant said.  You don't know where all this fucking money's going. 
[00:39:30]  You just don't know where it's going.  And everyone has the feeling it's just being filtered up to just a few people.  That's it.  As the working Joes don't get to see any of it.  Right.  But with that said, then you move back to Occupy Wall Street.  You want to be like rah, rah, rah and go, you go, boys.  But then they fucking shut down subways and bridges where the working guys, making the working guys stay up.  They're fucking the people that are supposed to be representing. 
[00:40:00]  That's so stupid.  They're dumb.  That's just dumb.  What?  So they could get more press?  The press is well aware that you guys are doing shit.  Yeah.  But why are you going to fuck up the guy that's, you know, just trying to make a stupid living?  And Macy's.  Oh, they're gathering.  Oh, it's 7 o'clock is go time.  They're gathering at Zuccotti.  Well, that doesn't look like much of a gathering.  They're all texting.  Well, they got more people there than they did.  Oh, shit.  No, okay.  Yeah, there's at least a thousand there.  And just so you know, we're going to be at the Hard Rock in a little while.  Yeah.  8 o'clock.  We're having our Thanks for Nothing. 
[00:40:30]  We have a play written.  We're doing the first Thanksgiving play.  It's very funny, I think.  There's some really funny lines in it.  And we got the mashed potato eating contest.  It's just a stupid thing, but it's going to be a background thing.  Jimmy, are you going to have to hold your script?  Yeah.  No, I'm off book.  How are you off book?  Jimmy's off book already?  No, I'm not off book.  No, no, no.  We're going to have to hold our script.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll have to.  I need mine concealed like a scroll.  So it would be like...  Why don't you do the old cheat sheet on your wrist?  Yeah.  I got a few lines, though.  Yeah.  I don't think I'd be able to draw all over myself. 
[00:41:00]  I know.  My cheat sheets, I used to get the fine point pen.  Yeah.  And I was more obsessed with how tiny I could write than actually learning knowledge.  My cheat sheet fit in the inside of my thumb.  Oh, really?  Like on your thumbprint?  And I taped it.  No, yeah, this whole...  That would be my cheat sheet.  Wow.  So then I would sit there with my hand on the fucking desk, and when the teacher turns back,  just turned over my thumb.  Wow.  That's how tiny I was able to write. 
[00:41:30]  Damn.  That's a good-looking cheat sheet.  Not only for this skit do we have outfits, of course, and set design, but we have little...  That's right, we have set design, props, we have little lavalier, lapel-type mics.  What?  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Oh, god damn.  I was hoping we wouldn't have to...  For some.  You know why?  Because if you're holding a microphone, it takes away from the historic thing.  Right.  Although I talked to Travis about this.  As will the Nerf gun.  And Bobo will not be getting one of those mics. 
[00:42:00]  I'm going to follow him around stage, holding a mic to his mouth, because he simply cannot  be trusted.  No, he's not.  Not to just babble incessantly.  He really is just a chatty asshole.  Although, his costume's my favorite by far.  Costumes.  Yeah, he's going to maybe have some makeup.  Can't wait to see.  Makeup ladies coming.  You know, this is kind of a thing that, for years, I always regretted not getting involved  in my school plays.  And you'd go and watch them and be like, I could have done that. 
[00:42:30]  I should have done it.  This is one of these things where it's like, finally, I'm going to be involved in a play.  Are you joking?  No.  I don't think...  I was part of theater in high school.  Oh, I wasn't at theater.  And it was a lot of fun to be called a faggot by the jocks.  So, oh, it was just wonderful.  I was too busy smoking pot.  But then I was on a bunch of sports teams, so...  It's like MTV's made.  Yeah.  As soon as...  I want to be in a Thanksgiving play. 
[00:43:00]  I want to be in a Thanksgiving play.  As soon as we brought up the play, because the original idea was just to put the goons  in a play.  Yeah.  And you, specifically, were the first guy to say, I want to be in a play.  And then Jim said, I want to be in.  Well, I have to be the star to play.  Chips.  Chips got a role.  Chips, you're not the star.  Of course.  Damn.  It's an ensemble cast, Chip.  It's not about you.  Well, take it off, Sambal.  It should be a one-man play with Chip.  Probably a one-man show.  It could turn into that.  And once I get called to Hollywood, I will put it in my contract that, once a year, I must return  here and do the Thanksgiving play. 
[00:43:30]  Stupid Ralph.  Anthony, unions can protect your ass from corporate shit.  Oh, yeah?  That's what this guy's saying.  Anthony's wrong.  I want to give Anne some glimmering hope.  I'm 23 and have an engineering degree.  Yeah, you know, you do see the younger people doing the right thing.  We got one in this whole building, Sal.  The rest of them are fucking useless.  Sal and Manny.  Sal's working his ass off and understands that he also has to work really hard to get  anywhere in life.  Yeah.  Because people have forgotten that, I think. 
[00:44:00]  Or some of them.  Right?  Yeah.  We got it here.  We got Matt, who basically wants his life handed to him, right?  Matt, the intern.  Of course.  And then you got Sal going, fuck that.  I don't trust anybody around me.  I'm going to work really hard.  I'm taking what they're giving because I'm working for a living.  Holla.  So we got both ends of the spectrum right here at Sirius.  It's like a microcosm.  Oh, it really is.  Should we break?  Yeah, let's take a little break and read.  Lonnie, though, says something in it. 
[00:44:30]  With all the taxes you pay in New York, which is un-fucking-believable for everybody, you  should be the richest city in the world.  Well, that's true.  If it wasn't for the, I think, people pocketing this money, politicians and workers and unions  and whatnot, pocketing this money at an alarming rate, and the fact that New York also has so  many people that are on the dole, that are out there, that we have to take care of.  But, you know, there's a lot of poor people that get a lot of the money. 
[00:45:00]  You see the corruption.  All you have to do in New York is go underground, and you realize what the fuck is going on in  this city.  Because you go to any other city, the subway systems are fucking beautiful.  In the main cities, they're really nice.  You'd hang out down there.  They don't have a lot of people who would do this stuff.  But they haven't fucking, they've barely upgraded the system, barely, since we've been, you know.  It is, and another thing is, it's a very difficult system to do anything with. 
[00:45:30]  I'll even give them a break on this one, because it's one of the first ones in the country.  It's just, it's been here forever.  They just dug holes and put subways.  Very hard.  With a new city, with a new subway system, you're putting it in using today's, relatively  today's technology.  This, it was a bunch of old fucking immigrants digging holes in the ground in the 1800s and  early 1900s.  They certainly could make it look way nicer.  They did it in Boston.  Boston's an extremely old city.  Boston had a horrible fucking, they got a horrible subway T system, whatever it is. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, I mean, it's a smaller system than New York, obviously.  Yeah, that's just what it is.  It's New York's got a crazy system.  Have you been to the subway system in Washington?  Fuck, is it beautiful.  A lot newer, yeah.  Really nice.  Yeah.  Let's eat and read.  We have to.  The Opinion 3 Channel.  Oh, yeah.  On Sirius XM.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got a break. 
[00:46:30]  I'm going to put it up for the station.  I can't.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, yo.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  All right, yo.  All right, yo.  All right, yo. 
[00:47:00]  He's late at night.  And I got nowhere to go.  My money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says,  And you know I have an angel.  And he says,  That angel. 
[00:47:30]  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Women these days tend to spend more time focusing on their careers. 
[00:48:00]  Than their personal needs.  That's why we at the Opie and Anthony show have developed the Daniel Bobo Curlin Awkward Sexual Interludes audio companion.  Now, ladies, you can fantasize about being seduced by someone who has never seduced a woman ever. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, I'm very, I think, I think I've gotten a boner.  And I need to fuck someone.  This 60-minute barrage of uncomfortable sex talk will have you dripping in seconds.  I'd love to go down on you.  And I'd go slowly up you.  Then I just take that tuck.  And I, and I want you to just ram that right in you.  He stammers.  I want it so hard.  I want it so hard.  You want it.  He stutters.  It, it is up, all right?  Oh, it's big.  I think three and a half inches when it's a boner. 
[00:49:00]  He moans uncomfortably.  Yeah, that's what I want.  Yeah, keep going.  And he spends way too much time.  I'd stick it in your ass.  Fixating about what he'd like to stick.  Oh, I, I would want to stick it in your ass right now.  In your hiney.  I would just shove, I would just shove back up your ass.  So ladies, if you want to get sexed up.  I just want to just fuck the crap out of you.  By the unsexiest voice you've ever heard.  Yeah, I'm going balls deep.  Order the Daniel Bobo Curlin Awkward Sexual Interludes audio companion today. 
[00:49:30]  Boy, you're going to get fucked with my bo-boner.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're getting ready to go to the Hard Rock Cafe for the big Thanks for Nothing live broadcast.  Yes.  Is there a reason there?  I don't know.  I don't feel like fucking fun there.  It's for Thanksgiving.  I'm just wondering.  Oh. 
[00:50:00]  E-Rock?  What's the reason today?  Of course there's a reason.  Sex Man?  Well.  Getting topical with the Sex Man.  What's up?  31 years ago, John Lennon released Double Fantasy.  Jesus.  Are you serious?  We didn't need to know that.  Wow.  That just shows you that time sucks.  31 years ago?  31.  Where was Ravi?  Did Ravi approve?  Ravi used to play my record.  Ravi.  Love the Ravi. 
[00:50:30]  Dumb Ravi.  Isn't Ravi's daughter doing pretty well?  Nora.  Is Nora Jones Ravi's daughter?  Is she?  Ravi.  I don't know.  I think there's some talent with his daughter.  Is it Nora Jones?  Ravi's daughter.  I'm telling you.  Is it daughter?  I'm not sure.  That's what I'm asking.  Nora Jones, right?  Wow.  He fucked some chick named something Jones, huh?  Ravi.  Hey, I know we're getting out of here in a few minutes, but this Penn State scandal. 
[00:51:00]  I know.  It's hot.  There's a few things fucking going on here.  First of all, you got Joe Paterno, who signed over his house to his wife for a dollar a month  or two ago, so he knew shit was going to go down.  Yeah, I guess Joe Pa should have allowed to play that last game, huh?  Joe Pa.  Yeah, those guys are a little more silent these days.  They've shut the fuck up.  A lot of them have shut the fuck up.  I'm sorry it happened to your school, but this is a doozy, and this is going to get extremely  ugly.  Yeah, Joe Pa signs over his house for a dollar to his wife. 
[00:51:30]  Why would you do that at 84 years old, right?  It's not actually even more than it's worth.  And then you got McQuarrie.  Everyone's saying he's lying.  Yeah.  They have no record of McQuarrie reporting alleged assault.  Now, of course, he's the coach there that saw Sandusky with the young boy.  Tooling him up the keister.  With the rhythmic slapping as he was fucking the 10-year-old boy in the shower.  And McQuarrie supposedly told what? 
[00:52:00]  Joe Pa.  He went to Joe Pa.  And Joe Pa kicked it upstairs.  Well, they have no record of McQuarrie reporting alleged assault.  Who doesn't?  Penn State.  Oh, McQuarrie's.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Pennsylvania cops say they have no records that support Mike McQuarrie's claim that he called police after he allegedly saw Penn State.  You can't say you called the police. 
[00:52:30]  They fucking have records of all that shit.  Yeah.  He said he had reported it to the police and the police are saying, nope.  Nope.  Sorry about that, sir.  Sorry.  And then he also said that he stopped the rape.  But he's not giving any details.  He didn't physically intervene.  He's walking in.  Yeah.  He stopped the rape by walking in on it.  I don't think Sandusky at that point is like, ah, fuck.  No one continues fucking a 10-year-old when someone walks in.  Yeah, I don't think so.  Might as well finish.  Well, it's, you know, depends on who walks in. 
[00:53:00]  Sold his house in July to his wife.  July.  So where are we up to?  I guess.  All right.  Three months ago or so?  Yeah.  And Sandusky is free just walking around out there.  And the other thing, that stupid fucking lawyer that he has allowing Sandusky to do the interview with Bob Costas.  Yeah.  That has motivated more victims to go, oh, really?  Yeah.  It just pissed off a lot of victims that were maybe staying in the shadows.  And now they're saying, fuck that. 
[00:53:30]  I'm talking.  And I'm giving more details.  Because Sandusky basically saying he didn't do anything.  Anything.  Anything inappropriate.  By the way, Sandusky's lawyer knocked up a 17-year-old when he was 49.  I heard 16.  I heard 17.  Oh.  Yeah.  Whatever it is it rules.  Then he married her.  Yeah.  Well, he's an asshole.  Joe Amidola, I think, right?  Is his name?  Is he a good lawyer?  He basically casually said if you're a jock, it was normal behavior to shower with each other.  Meaning, you know, fooling around in the showers. 
[00:54:00]  It's fine with a 10-year-old.  Horseplay.  He's a fucking asshole, too.  Horseplay, right.  I don't like the horseplay argument.  No one believes you, Joe.  Jerry, no one believes that a man of your age with your old man ball bag was fucking  horseplaying with a nude 10-year-old.  Poor horses.  They're never jerking each other off or playing smack ass with each other.  They can't because they have hooves.  Yeah.  Well, God curse the horses.  They're getting all cocks.  Not even allow them to fucking jerk themselves off.  Giant cocks.  Or each other.  And you can't do anything with them. 
[00:54:30]  Or each other, right.  You've got hooves, no fingers.  You've just got to stare at all those delicious cocks all day long in the stable, and you can't do anything.  Hooves are useless.  And they can't even blow each other because the mouth doesn't seem to really open.  No, they've got those teeth right there.  It's very difficult.  They do have the long face that would aid in the horse cock insertion.  But horses stink.  Horses stink.  They don't have fingers.  No.  But it's a hoof.  They do, actually.  If you take their hoof off, they have five little cramped fingers. 
[00:55:00]  That's the funny thing.  When you shoe a horse, you're really gloving him.  You don't know that, but there's little finger grooves.  Little finger grooves.  They can't grab anything, though.  And why did we decide they need to have fucking horseshoes?  I watched them shoeing a horse when we did the Leno thing for the Kentucky Derby.  Yeah.  And I was watching a guy.  There's a fucking...  Because those horses are treated like, you know, whatever good things are treated like.  You've got to know what you're doing.  Boy, they fucking...  They were filing down those shoes while it's... 
[00:55:30]  And the horse just stands there while the guy will take the horse hoof and stick it back between his legs.  Yeah.  It's fucking really weird.  The horse just stands there with his fucking hoof between the guy's legs.  Yeah, yeah.  They bring it out, like, between their legs, and then he's got...  He gets those nails in there and then clips the nails off and then files it down.  It really is...  He's got to bend the horseshoe in the right shape for the hoof.  Why would the horse, like, kick backwards and nail him in the balls?  They're used to it.  They kind of know, yeah.  I wouldn't trust a horse.  I knew a comedian.  I forget his name.  He was a real tall dude, and he was a vet as well as a stand-up. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, where did he surf?  It's funny you should ask that.  Not say it, but ask it.  But no, he said that he one time saw where he knew of a horse that was being shooed,  had a half a nail in it, and kicked...  The guy was doing it wrong, and kicked back into the guy's mouth.  Oh!  And fucking, with a half of a nail sticking out of his foot, just kicked the guy through  his lip and gums.  Damn, really?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  One for the horse.  Yeah.  And my Jets are having a tough year, and now tonight we've got to play Jesus himself, 
[00:56:30]  so fuck.  We're a little nervous.  Jesus.  We're playing Tebow, who's basically Jesus.  They call him Jesus, yeah.  They put in controversial jerseys, what people are wearing with Jesus on the back.  But Tebow isn't wearing a jersey like that, right?  No.  Oh, okay.  But we have to play Jesus tonight.  A lot of guys like Jesus.  Why don't they stop with Jesus?  He doesn't give a fuck about sports.  No.  Idiots you are.  He doesn't give a fuck about the world.  No.  He's just letting it go to shit. 
[00:57:00]  He really is.  He doesn't care about Madoff's victims losing a billion dollars.  He cares about Jets cover?  He's an absentee landlord.  Look, but don't touch.  Touch, but don't taste.  Buy lips, but don't put them in your shoes.  Buy a wig, don't put it on.  At this point, he might be an asshole.  There's billions of people that worship him and do it right by him,  and he just sits there and watches.  Still not enough, sorry. 
[00:57:30]  Just going to sit back still.  Absentee landlord.  What a great line.  Look, but don't touch.  Touch.  Touch.  But don't taste.  Taste.  Don't swallow.  Anthony, everyone's saying she was 16.  I heard 17.  A 10-year-old went to the lawyer for that emancipation thing.  Probably did it at 16, and then maybe at 17 he stepped up and got her pregnant. 
[00:58:00]  So maybe he met her at 16?  Yeah.  So it's one of those cases where she didn't want to be associated with her parents anymore.  Goes to this lawyer, and then he knocks her up, taking advantage of the innocence of a girl that's in a tough spot.  Nothing greater than an emancipated fucking teen.  They're just, you know they hate their parents, and they're on their own, but they can't quite, you know, can't quite fucking get by on their own.  So they're looking for the proverbial sugar daddy. 
[00:58:30]  Well, they're not together anymore.  Knocked up, had the kid, and they're living separately now.  What does emancipated mean?  That you're kind of free of your parents?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Before you're 18, you're able to just leave, live on your own.  Oh, that's the best law.  Yeah, it is a great law.  Fuck, I wonder if I could have done that with one of my parents.  How would that have worked?  I don't think we could do that.  No?  You have to go all in?  Probably.  Yeah.  There have been some celebrities that have done that, haven't there?  I'm sure.  Did Gary Coleman do it?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, I think when they're getting fucked over on their cash, they decide, I'm going 
[00:59:00]  to get emancipated and keep my money.  Jason in Detroit, Jason.  Morning, gentlemen.  Morning.  About the Sandusky scandal, don't you think that the Penn State would have maybe deleted  all those files or got rid of them if McClary did report it?  Well, Jason, that's why I went to your phone call.  I think that's absolutely possible, because it seems like everyone was in on this fucking  cover-up.  But what the article is saying is the Pennsylvania cops, because McQuarrie said that he called 
[00:59:30]  the police, meaning the Pennsylvania cops, and they're not going to fucking erase records  in most cases.  No.  In just about every case.  Okay.  I didn't know.  I didn't realize this guy said that he went to the actual Pennsylvania cops.  Now, if it was the Penn State cops, or whatever they're called, then I would be suspicious,  yes, that they could erase that shit.  All right.  I didn't know who he was reporting to, so thank you. 
[01:00:00]  Well, I didn't know this today either.  I was surprised to hear that this article is saying Pennsylvania cops.  Yeah.  That's not the university cops, or whatever.  Macaulay Culkin.  Macaulay?  He got emancipated.  Yeah.  Bijou Phillips.  Yeah.  Courtney Love and Frances Bean Cobain.  Wow.  Both got emancipated.  Elijah Dushku?  Yeah, but...  Frances Bean hates Courtney Love.  Elijah got emancipated to get around child labor laws.  Frances Bean, it was yes, because she hates Courtney Love.  She absolutely hates Courtney Love. 
[01:00:30]  I wonder what happened there.  Maybe she was sick of hearing about Nirvana growing up.  Enough of this shit.  Enough.  Yes, okay, that's my father, but how about we go and do something else?  Stop obsessing about this band and trying to make money off my dead dad.  Yeah.  Let it go, Ma.  He wasn't exactly here for us.  Well, recently she lost her fucking shit.  Does anyone have the story?  I didn't realize we were going to talk about this today.  She was at Sao Paulo.  Sao Paulo?  Sao Paulo?  In Brazil.  Sao Paulo. 
[01:01:00]  Some big rock show, and somebody held up a Nirvana picture or something, and she just  lost her mind?  Fuck.  Yelled or cried?  Travis would know this, but he's...  He's queer.  Yeah, I think he already went to Hard Rock.  Yeah, he's busy with the Hard Rock stuff.  Yeah, he's over there blundering.  You got the story really fast?  I'm seeing that she said the Foo Fighters are gay.  Well, that's true.  She's attacking Dave Grohl.  She's attacking Dave Grohl.  Why?  What did Dave Grohl do to her?  Dave Grohl's fucking unbelievable career in rock.  What did she contribute to Nirvana, besides fucking obviously nagging somebody too much? 
[01:01:30]  I don't know.  Is this what it is?  Is this the clip?  It looks like it, yes.  How long is that?  It's 244.  Oh, fuck.  You want to hear this real sense of part of it?  She's only famous because he shot himself.  Right.  Yeah, and then after he died, her music was very suspicious.  Like, she might have found some things laying around the fucking house and said, oh, fuck,  I'll make this song.  Mine, yeah.  Very suspicious.  Hit it.  Oh, shit.  This is fucking hard.  You know, I don't need to see a picture of Kurt, asshole. 
[01:02:00]  And I'm going to have you fucking removed if you keep throwing that up.  I'm not Kurt.  I have to live with this fucking shit and this ghost and this kid every day.  Throwing that up is stupid and rude.  And I'm going to beat the fuck out of you and do it again.  Are you?  Are you really?  Why would they cheer that?  She'd be a cunt.  Yeah.  You know what?  You weren't fucking married to him.  I fucking was.  You didn't get kicked out of a band by him like Dave.  He did.  Go see the fucking Foo Fighters and do that shit.  Ah, don't cheer that. 
[01:02:30]  Great.  We'll leave now.  Fuck you.  Oh, well.  Oh, shit.  Oh, well.  I'm leaving the stage.  What a baby.  Go, you fucking moderately talented zilch.  What a cunt.  Makes it about herself on every Comedy Central row she's on.  What a fucking twat.  And what?  She's mad at Dave Grohl's success after Nirvana?  Wait a minute.  Was she shitting on Dave Grohl there?  It sounded like she was saying like, Dave got, she said go there and do that to Dave  Grohl.  Dave Grohl will probably really jump off and punch you in the face. 
[01:03:00]  Was she like, she was saying like, Dave got fucked over by Kurt, Kurt did shitty things  to me and Dave.  Yeah.  That's what that sounded like.  But I don't think Dave would care if someone held up a picture of Kurt Cobain.  Was that a nasty thing the guy was holding up?  Maybe he was just holding it up because it was part of her.  I don't know.  Yeah, that doesn't...  Yeah, we got time to have.  All right, let's go over there.  Yeah.  We got a lot of stuff going on.  E-Rock's very upset about the script of the...  What?  Oh, is he really?  Very upset about the script.  Oh, you shouldn't be.  So, Sam, lay it out for everybody.  All right, we're going to...  People are showing up at the Hard Rock as we speak.  Yeah, come now. 
[01:03:30]  You can probably still get in.  It's the Hard Rock in Times Square.  We're going to have a little bit of listener karaoke.  We're going to have a mashed potato eating contest.  That's really just so you come and you can win $500.  We're going to have Voss and Bobby Kelly there.  And the big thing is the first Thanksgiving skit performed by Anthony and Chip Chipperson  and Bobo and Voss.  Roland's going to be the narrator.  And Bob Kelly and Opie are doing Foley work.  Yes.  They are Foley work. 
[01:04:00]  Foley artists.  Yes, yes.  Sound effects.  What sounds do we need today?  Because I brought up a whole bag of things.  They're all written down.  You'll see them.  Okay, good.  And we're all...  Oh, the giveaway.  We're giving away no tickets for my Borgata show, the 15th.  Oh, Jimmy!  With Artie Lange and such, Stan Hope and David Tell.  You'll get nothing.  Don't call now.  But this is a Thanksgiving special.  Yes, it is.  So keep those fingers crossed.  And if you behave yourselves, maybe Santa Claus will come. 
[01:04:30]  What?  What?  Oh, because much like the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Maybe.  The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade always ends with Santa Claus because that's what happens  after Thanksgiving.  If the children are behaved.  Do you think?  That dirty kid toucher, Santa Claus.  Oh, you know he's just fucking the worst.  What the hell was that about, man?  All right.  So we're going to head over there.  Come join us, will you?  Yes.  Can we do a live read, get one of them out of the way, or what?  I'm going to try to do, if we can do two live reads before we go over, that would be 
[01:05:00]  great.  Oh, we're making believe we're leaving, but we're doing live reads here?  Yeah, but we're going to be here for about three more minutes doing live reads and then  go.  We're going to physically be here.  Goddamn things.  Yeah.  Wait, so we're still going to be on the air because they're going to hear our voice and  realize we haven't left yet.  Right.  I'm really confused.  There's going to be a sweeper.  Right.  And then we're going to do a live read.  Right.  Then there's going to be about three minutes of commercials.  But we already said goodbye.  Then we're going to do another live read.  We already said we'll see you at the Hard Rock.  But we're not going to say goodbye after the second live read.  Give me the paper. 
[01:05:30]  There you go.  Give me the goddamn paper.  Hit it.  In case you didn't know or can't figure it out, this is the Opie and Anthony Channel on  Sirius XM.  Thanks for nothing.  The Opie and Anthony Show's pre-Thanksgiving live broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe, Times  Square, is moments away. 
[01:06:00]  In the meantime, feast on a fat slab of the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, it's Sam Roberts.  No, it's not.  Well, it's not after Opie and Anthony Live yet.  It's during Opie and Anthony Live.  Opie and Anthony are going to be at the Hard Rock live this morning in actually just a couple  minutes.  I'm not sure how many minutes.  They left me back here because I don't know why, but they told me to just stay back here  and put on some bits for you.  So that's what I'm doing.  We're doing Thanks for Nothing live from the Hard Rock.  If you're listening to this now, rush down there, the Hard Rock in Times Square, and 
[01:06:30]  get online because you can, I'm sure, still get in.  I hope it depends.  I haven't seen how many people are lined up because I'm not there yet.  But in the meantime, Opie and Anthony are actually walking or probably being chauffeured, let's  face it.  They're celebrities at this point, to the Hard Rock as we speak.  They're going to go live any minute.  So at some point, this will just cut out abruptly and we'll go straight to the Hard Rock or to  a commercial break and then the Hard Rock.  I don't control those big decisions.  But in the meantime, we're going to play some bits so I'm not just babbling like an idiot 
[01:07:00]  like I usually do here for the entire time.  Penn Jillette is a favorite of ours.  He was in studio over the summer.  He was promoting his book, God Know, and he was talking about why he doesn't like Kreskin.  The amazing Kreskin?  The magnificent Kreskin?  I don't know who he is.  I'm too young for that.  Kreskin sued him at one point and he told the whole story.  It was a great story.  So listen to this again, we may have to cut out halfway through it to go straight to the  Hard Rock where Opie and Anthony are going to be there live doing Thanks for Nothing. 
[01:07:30]  And if we don't, then I'll be back after this.  So enjoy.  This is the worst, is the worst Opie and Anthony.  Serious.  XM.  Penn Jillette, everyone.  We just went to the TV.  I fucked up a pretty good rap that was happening on our show.  But still, Kreskin was on the dumb fucking TV.  We hate Kreskin.  Don Kreskin was on.  And we know you're not a big fan of Kreskin either.  I've read some of the book.  What is the chapter?  There was one chapter with Kreskin's name in it.  Yeah, asking him to sue me. 
[01:08:00]  You know, it's amazing.  When I was 12 years old or something, you know, Kreskin was on some TV show.  And it wasn't Carson.  You know that because Carson would not allow the stupid fuck on.  Right.  That was an absolute Johnny Carson rule.  A stupid fuck.  Carson was really pro-science.  As a matter of fact, Carson was a skeptic and gave a huge amount of money to the James  Randy Society.  And Carson would call me up about bullshit. 
[01:08:30]  You know, he was a real fan.  Wow.  He was huge into astronomy.  He also talked, Carson talked privately a lot about being an atheist, but always felt  guilty he didn't talk about it more publicly.  So Kreskin was on some show, some jive-ass show.  Mike Douglas.  Let's say Mike Douglas just for fun.  And he was demonstrating his ESP kit, his science kit, with the ESP cards and this pendulum  that did idiomatic, micro-idiomatic movements. 
[01:09:00]  You know, you think something and the pendulum moves the way.  It starts moving, yeah.  And I was really into science as a child.  And my parents, you know, I'm not from a wealthy family.  I'm from, you know, from western Massachusetts, a dead factory town.  So buying stuff was a big deal.  My parents would buy stuff from me if it was science-oriented.  So they bought me this piece of shit ESP kit, thinking it was science, right?  Because I'd seen him do this experiment on TV, you know, experiment, and I was into science. 
[01:09:30]  And then because my sister is 23 years older than me and had already moved out, I was raised  essentially as an only child.  So my parents would have to sit and do this piece of shit game with me.  And we did that.  Because, you know, I took it seriously.  You know the kind of guy I am.  So I'm taking, like, tallies.  And other kids just throwing the pendulum around and shit.  But I'm taking tallies and doing it carefully.  And then, like, a few weeks later, I'm in our public library, which I want all the time.  And if all of us are familiar with the Dewey Decimal System.  Of course.  And we know that... 
[01:10:00]  800 is pure science.  Absolutely.  Right around the juggling books.  And when I say books, I mean book.  Because I was juggling a lot then.  We're the magic books, you know.  And I take out the juggling book.  And I was working on all this stuff.  I took out the magic book.  And there was a book, I think, by Dunninger on mental magic.  He was a big mentalist in the 40s and 50s.  Huge, huge star on radio.  And so I'm thumbing through the book.  And there in the magic book is the exact same trick that Kreskin had done in how to do it. 
[01:10:30]  And it wasn't science.  It was a bullshit magic trick.  And because I was 12, maybe not.  Maybe because I'm psychotic.  But let's say it's because I was 12.  I completely flipped out.  And I dropped out of all science.  I hated science.  Wow.  I wouldn't go near...  I was embarrassed in front of my parents.  I was miserable.  I was horrible.  It was terrible.  I, I, uh...  Was it because you at that point had thought science was a gag?  At that point I thought, well, scientists lie to you. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, okay.  Scientists lie to children.  Why should I be involved with them?  And I hated magic because they were part of it and the whole thing.  And it wasn't really until I was 18 and met Teller and Amazing Randy that I, that I turned around.  So I wrote this story to, um, uh, for a skeptics magazine about how much I hated Kreskin, right?  I said, because you might think he turned me on to skepticism, but he didn't.  He just stole money from my parents and stole time and love from our family.  That's why the chapter, the chapter is called Maybe That Thief Kreskin Will Sue Me This Time. 
[01:11:30]  So wait a minute, so I get this letter, and this is what I'm living in New York.  Remember, I'm living in New York.  I'm on Broadway, right?  I'm not married.  I don't have children, and my parents are both alive and healthy, okay?  All of that is important.  And I get this note from Kreskin saying, from Kreskin's attorneys, saying he's going to sue me.  And I just got rock fucking hard.  I was so happy, because now I could, like, I could, I could bring forth all this vengeance 
[01:12:00]  from my 12-year-old self and just go crazy.  So I call my lawyer, and I go, oh, Kreskin's suing me.  I'm sorry.  He says, I'm sure we can get out of it.  I go, we don't want to get out of it.  This is very, very exciting.  I want to be sued.  I want to take him down to Chinatown.  This will be fucking great.  And so I tell him, you know, the New York Times v. Alabama civil rights, nothing compared  to what I do.  I've got so much fucking money. 
[01:12:30]  I've got nothing to spend it on.  Let's use it all to take down Kreskin.  So my lawyer writes this note saying, first of all, you can't sue Penn and Teller, because  it was only Penn that said it.  And second of all, any reading of this means he didn't really mean you broke into the house.  He means that he disagrees with you, da-da-da-da-da.  And the lawyer of Kreskin writes back and says, okay, we won't sue you.  So I call my lawyer and go, what do you mean he won't sue me?  He's got to sue me. 
[01:13:00]  I mean, he goes, Penn, you can't force someone to sue you.  So then, just to make how much, how much, I'm getting a little carried away.  Please forgive me.  I love it.  So we cut to about 10 years ago, I guess.  We're living in Vegas.  And Debbie Reynolds has a hotel there, the Debbie Reynolds Hotel.  And I'm friends with Carrie Fisher.  And I've also felt Debbie Reynolds' breast, which is a whole other story.  A very good story.  And I'll take a little... 
[01:13:30]  I was at the Porno Awards.  We want to hear this.  I was at the Porno Awards.  And I'm there with Nina Hartley and Al...  I'm there with Al Goldstein and a few other people and Gina Fine.  And Nina Hartley comes over.  And I'm sitting at a table that also has at it Carrie Fisher and Buck Henry.  And Nina Hartley comes over and says, Penn, do you like my new tits?  And I go, very much so.  And she says, feel them.  So I feel her tits.  And they're wonderful.  And then she leaves. 
[01:14:00]  And Carrie Fisher turns to me.  I'd never met her.  Carrie Fisher turns to me and goes, would you like to feel my breasts?  I've been in legitimate features.  That was her way of putting it.  And I said, yes, very much so.  So I feel Carrie Fisher's tits, which, incidentally, greatest tits, fabulous, unbelievable, breathtaking tits.  Princess Leia.  Wow.  And that's fantastic.  What year?  What year was that?  Oh, this would have been, I don't know, 90s sometime.  All right.  Fair enough.  Maybe early 90s.  Fabulous.  And then later on in Vegas, I got together with Carrie Fisher. 
[01:14:30]  And we went over to her mother's casino.  And she said, you know, you should meet my mother.  Then Debbie Reynolds came out.  And Carrie Fisher said, you know, Penn, you love to tell stories.  You're good at telling stories.  And you should fill up my mother, because that would be a great story for you.  And she said, so mom, can Penn feel your breast?  And Debbie Reynolds goes and feels each of her breasts and chooses one.  And then says, yes, feel this one.  So I feel Debbie Reynolds' tits.  And I tell this story on the radio in some, you know, dog fuck town. 
[01:15:00]  Good morning, dog fuck was the name of the show, you know.  Starring dog and fuck.  I go on the show.  And I do all these incredibly unpleasant jokes.  But then one point during it, I go, and, you know, I felt up Debbie Reynolds, because she's a friend.  They got more hate mail on feeling up Debbie Reynolds than they'd ever gotten on anything.  So be ready.  Be ready.  Okay.  Sorry.  Our people will hate you because you didn't kill her. 
[01:15:30]  So Kreskin is playing the Debbie Reynolds Hotel.  And Teller, me, a couple of showgirls, or show, I don't know what the plural is.  I guess showgirls.  I thought it was maybe showgaggle or something.  And Lance Burton and a juggler named Michael Godot, who also writes on bullshit.  Like a gang out of the Warriors.  Absolutely.  And then the final person was the topless bull rider from one of the shows. 
[01:16:00]  Woman was there with us.  And we all go in, and we all pay full price for our afternoon tickets for the Kreskin show.  Because we're going to go see them.  And we go in there, and we sit down, and the show's supposed to start at like 2 in the afternoon.  And there's nobody there.  You know, there's people that get tickets with the buffet and stuff.  And then us sitting in the booth.  And the show doesn't start.  It's like 10 minutes late.  You know, in Vegas, shows start right on time.  So I want you to get back in there so you can gamble.  And so we're sitting there, sitting there.  And finally tell them I decide we have to pee. 
[01:16:30]  So we get up, and we go.  We piss.  We come back.  And the maitre d' says, you're not allowed back in.  And I said, excuse me?  And he goes, Kreskin has said you're not allowed into the showroom.  He will not start as long as Penn and Teller are in the showroom.  And I go, well, we haven't been disruptive.  You can tell we're not drunk.  Here are our receipts.  We have the tickets.  We're going in.  He goes, I'm sorry.  I can't let you go in.  And I said, well, then you better call Metro because the police are going to have to take us out. 
[01:17:00]  And now I'm all excited because now, not only am I in a lawsuit, but also I get to go limp.  It's like I'm in Birmingham.  And I tell Lance Burton, call the local paper and bring photographers in because I want pictures of Penn and Teller being taken in handcuffs out of the Debbie Reynolds Theater by a guy who's going to do card tricks.  This would be fabulous.  And we sit there, you know, and, you know, I have never heckled in my life.  I'm not disruptive.  I mean, here on the show, I'm loud and aggressive. 
[01:17:30]  That's my fucking job.  You invited me on.  If we were just out hanging out, I'm not going to, like, you know, heckle the, you know, heckle or something.  But I am going to be, I'm going to sit there full of hate.  But he will be able to detect that psychically, but there won't be anything out there.  So now we are 20 minutes after his show is supposed to start.  And let me tell you, let me tell you what this guy does. 
[01:18:00]  He walks out on stage 20 minutes late with his head kind of down and kind of sniffing.  And he says, I want to apologize for being late today.  My mother, 97 years old, is in the hospital.  And it was kind of an uncomfortable time.  And I just got a call.  And thank God she's going to be okay.  And the audience applauds. 
[01:18:30]  Now, there is a chance.  There is a chance.  There is a chance his mother was really sick.  And if his mother was really sick, you know, I was very close to my mom.  I lost my mom.  My heart goes out to him.  But there is also a chance.  And I don't know the fact.  There is also a chance he was lying.  And if he was lying, fuck him in the neck.  That's all I got to say.  And fuck his mother for taking part in it.  So that's my little comment about that.  Holy shit, that's a hell of a story.  Thanks for nothing. 
[01:19:00]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.  The Opie and Anthony Show's pre-Thanksgiving live broadcast from the Hard Rock Times Square is coming up shortly.  8 a.m. Eastern.  Here's another helping of the worst of Opie and Anthony while you wait.  That was Penn Jillette.  We're obviously still here.  Opie and Anthony are set.  They're going to go live soon.  They're at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  You can join them if they're still letting people in.  It might be full.  Obviously, I'm not there yet.  But I'm still here.  But we're playing some bits in the meantime while they get ready to go live.  We're going to go any second to start Thanks for Nothing live from the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[01:19:30]  That's the cute name for the special.  You can't do a live gig without a cute name.  Thanks for nothing is this one.  But in the meantime, we're playing a couple bits.  Voss, apparently he dated some very attractive women in his time.  I'll take his word for it.  He talked one day when we had Jay Moore in studio.  It was not quite a year ago.  talking about his ex-girlfriends and the pictures of them  that he keeps locked up in a briefcase in his house.  It's a very strange thing, but Voss is a very strange guy. 
[01:20:00]  Enjoy this.  It's Rich Voss and his ex-girlfriend briefcase.  We may, again, we may cut it off to go straight to the Hard Rock.  But if we don't, I'll see you in a few.  We'll not see, but you understand.  Just play the bit.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on SiriusXM.  I'm a nincompoop on the computer.  Emails only.  People are like, did you get it?  I'm like, I don't have a fucking printer in my house.  Fucking drop it in the mailbox like Pauly and Goodfellas.  Come by.  Mailbox?  What's that?  People go, I sent you all your flight information. 
[01:20:30]  I go, well, then I don't have my flight information  because it's in my computer.  I don't know.  Wait, you don't get it through email and stuff?  I get it, but I don't have a printer in my house.  How do you have a printer?  Because I'm a fucking stooge.  Well, you just do it on your phone.  Get a printer in your house.  I can get stuff on my phone, but then I forget.  I like writing stuff and printing it.  You've got to have a printer.  You really do.  I love having a printer.  You need a printer.  I take great pride in it.  Now, are you more pro-printer or more pro-easy-pass?  Oh my God, we're not going to do this on this show.  What?  What? 
[01:21:00]  Am I more pro-printer or pro-easy-pass?  I have a printer.  I'm for both.  He tells you all the things you have to get in life  that makes his life easier.  Yes, they make everyone's life easier.  That's not true.  Easy-pass?  It might not.  You don't know.  Who?  How?  How?  How?  Yes, maybe if you're trying, if you don't want to be tracked.  He doesn't have it.  To be tracked.  You don't want to be tracked now.  You're not that important.  They're not going to...  I'm not saying you're saying some people...  Do you have credit cards, Profiler? 
[01:21:30]  Yes, I do.  Do they fucking track you there?  Everywhere.  All they got to do is go from empty comedy club to empty comedy club.  To Long Island.  What'd you say to me here?  All they got to do is go from empty comedy club to empty comedy club.  That was fantastic.  Very good.  Very good.  No one is a pro-printer.  Ooh, threw the gum away.  Yeah, you did.  How could you not?  You were an inch away from the cup.  Abdul-Jabbar.  Did you see mine and Rich's hands together?  Do it again, Rich.  Come on, Rich.  Put your little turtle feet hands up.  Turtle backs, too. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, put those turtle...  Your best line is...  Look how funny.  No, just line them up for real.  Line it up.  Line it up.  Oh, what a child.  He's got a gambling habit.  What?  What a child.  What's his name?  Cookie Jar.  Cookie Jar.  When we were...  He's got a gambling problem.  We, uh...  I don't know what that is.  Me and Mitch Boss were at the Continental Hotel watching Cookie Jar.  The lounge singer.  And Bruce Smirnoff.  Me, Rich, and Bruce Smirnoff.  And, uh...  Rich goes to the craps table and throws all his fucking money away. 
[01:22:30]  Comes back to the craps table and goes,  Could you loan me $100?  And I go, Sure.  And then he goes to the craps table and he comes back.  It's the same song.  And he comes back.  Oh, my God.  Like, he's fucking...  He just put $100.  Shicks the hard way.  And he loses it again.  And the singer's on stage.  And he leaves.  A three trip.  And now, at this point, I don't want him to pay me back.  I just want to feed this fucking addiction and watch it in front of my eyes.  That's where it goes.  That's my entertainment for the night.  Yeah.  So I'm like 600 into his fucking habit. 
[01:23:00]  It's the same song.  If you don't know me by now...  Handcuff him to the chair.  He's got a fucking sickness.  You'll never have a...  The guy actually fucking yelled that at Boss from the stage.  Holy shit.  Remember Brandy?  You'll never...  Yeah, Boss had some seven that he was fucking parading around Vegas.  She was definitely a nine.  A Boss seven is a fucking everyone else nine and a half.  That's good for me.  I'm saying it's a bell curve how you judge women. 
[01:23:30]  Like, we all are surprised that you married somebody who's beautiful and talented as Bonnie.  I always had hot girls in my fucking life.  Because you had Coke.  No, after.  I got a resume.  Because they thought you had Coke.  No, you fucking moron.  Why do I sound like Colin?  Shut your face.  I have pictures of home of the hottest fucking girls.  That's fucking good.  That's good for marriage.  That's it.  I keep them hidden in the basement, dummy.  I go down there to fucking spank one out.  Yeah.  I guess Bonnie doesn't listen to the show.  Do you really go to the basement and check out old fucking photographs? 
[01:24:00]  You're a serial killer, man.  What are you keeping a fucking chock full of nuts?  Fucking canned zilch.  That's where you put your photos in.  That's where you put the 8x10s.  I got them in a fucking briefcase.  A briefcase?  A briefcase?  Oh, you fucking...  Yeah, that's how old it is.  She'll never think they'll look there.  Yeah, exactly.  A briefcase in the basement with cum stains on it.  Yeah, a briefcase is way more normal than a fucking coffee can.  Rich says, there's nothing under here but a bunch of papers. 
[01:24:30]  What does Bonnie think in the briefcase?  Exactly.  You're a young lawyer.  You actually said the serial killer.  I picture you on a golf course going, well, the serial killer has a speech impediment.  I don't talk like that.  Only with a couple letters.  You're fucking up every letter.  H?  Yeah, and S.  Say sushi.  Three.  No, it's S.  We just said, this is what we did on Last Comic Standing.  To make me happy, you said I had sushi in church Tuesday.  I can say it perfectly.  All right.  Go ahead. 
[01:25:00]  And try it.  I had sushi.  Hold on.  It's not Sue.  I had sushi.  Sue?  Sushi in church on Tuesday.  I'm not your fucking game.  I don't play that shit.  If I was crippled.  What do you mean?  If I had like a fucking no legs, you would have said, get up and dance.  Yeah, we would.  I'm great with that.  You'd be just as tall as you are now.  My hands against your hands looks like we're fucking. 
[01:25:30]  Exactly.  Like Father Sunday.  You have bigger hands.  Say the sushi again.  No, enough already.  Say church.  No.  What do you mean no?  What else are we going to do?  What else are we going to do?  Come on, guys.  We lost the show hours ago.  What else are we going to do?  Look at the game.  Hours.  Do the church thing.  More.  Do it for fucking Jay Moore.  There you go.  It was perfect.  Love it.  But I say a couple of bad letters.  I don't say every word like that.  No, I know you don't.  Do you really have a briefcase with pictures in it?  Of old girlfriends? 
[01:26:00]  Of old girlfriends?  It's so fucked up.  It's a hard briefcase.  Do you remember?  Does Bonnie know that you have it?  You can't just do the spank bubble?  Does she hear the telltale click of an opening at fucking two in the morning?  Is there a lock on it?  You need the combination?  No.  Don't touch me, you freak.  It's not because he's a freak.  It's because we all know you get really uncomfortable.  Who wants to be?  There's too many uncomfortable things that go on in here.  What?  I love you.  I love you.  That love thing.  I love you.  What?  We don't say I love you. 
[01:26:30]  They say it all the time.  Where are you?  When was the last time we said that?  He doesn't know where he is.  Somebody called.  I love you guys.  I love you.  Yeah, that's uncomfortable when people express their admiration.  It's just common speak.  See, I don't say it like that.  Yes, you do.  You never heard it.  Say admiration.  Yes, you do.  Give me the line because you've never heard it.  It's a great line.  It's true.  I can't believe she got knocked off last week.  Say admiration.  Hey, did you guys have-  Wait, you watch American Idol? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  You know Pia?  I just know because they're talking about you.  Yeah, I can't-  I know Anamana Pia.  Oh, shit.  Did you guys have Trump on?  His son.  He's a great guy, actually.  We had a good time.  What one?  And the one that he likes?  He's a good guy for a billionaire son, yeah.  There's two of them.  There's two kids.  Yeah, it was Don Jr.  Don Jr.  It's like the bosses.  Not the blonde-haired.  The other one.  The blonde-haired.  I can't believe it.  What?  I'm being completely serious.  I can't fucking believe your daughter's 18 years old. 
[01:27:30]  18 and 20.  I have a 20-year-old, too.  We were in the Poconos.  They were like, we're playing fucking good old days now.  I apologize.  Where were we in the Poconos?  You and I did some gig together in the Poconos.  Yeah.  It was like, your kids were like six and eight.  It was great.  Yeah, we did a gig in the Poconos.  Remember your headlining Mount Harry Lodge?  He was.  That was two weeks ago.  He was.  They were there.  Oh, oh, that was the weekend my fucking wife was leaving me.  That's the weekend.  Oh, I fucking, that was OJ weekend.  Why are these black guys walking through like, yo, that's mad crazy in there, son. 
[01:28:00]  They just did shade 45.  But they pointed in here like, that's Jim Norton's.  No, they didn't.  Yes, they did.  Well, let's go get them.  Who are they?  If it's black people, I'm the one who's getting recognized.  Will you talk about the wife she left you that weekend when you were doing the Poconos  with Jay Moore?  That was my ex-wife.  Yeah, I think that was OJ weekend.  Where can we find a photo of your ex-wife?  Huh?  She's pretty.  What's going on?  Oh, the touching? 
[01:28:30]  Where can we find a photo of your ex-wife?  Do you have one?  No.  Why not?  Is that in the briefcase?  Is that in the briefcase?  I'm in a briefcase.  Is it in the briefcase?  Has Bonnie ever caught you masturbating?  Be honest.  No.  No.  My wife caught me masturbating.  Really?  Yep.  You know what she said to me?  What?  She said, is that something you need to do?  We were at a hotel, and we had already had sex, and she went to sleep, and then I was  watching a porno.  Did I tell it's already?  Yeah.  It's okay.  Tell it again for Rich.  Oh, new audience. 
[01:29:00]  And then, so she was asleep, and so I didn't want to wake her up, so I went in the room,  and I put on a movie on the pay-per-view, and I jerked off, and then she saw me, but  she didn't tell me, and it was like three weeks later, we're in the car, like driving  to Vegas.  We're in the middle of the desert, and she goes, when you masturbate, is that something  like you need to do?  And I was like, what?  And she goes, you know, like porno and stuff.  Is that what you need to do?  And I'm like, I act like I had no idea what she was talking about.  She goes, okay, well, just so you know, I'm kind of a sure thing.  Like, you can wake me up.  And I was like, oh, okay.  So then, porno goes out the window.  I was masturbating a couple weeks ago, and I talk about this, and I didn't want to, but 
[01:29:30]  I did.  And I fucking, I wasn't even hard.  I was semi-hard, and I came.  I didn't know that to me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can that happen?  Yes.  For 30 years, I've been doing that.  No, it can't.  You just said it happened.  Well, I mean, what do you think your dick is?  You answered your whole question.  It's amazing.  Under the spirit of 76, your cock is different than any other cock on the planet.  It certainly is.  Did he actually say, can that happen?  No, I mean, you know what I mean.  Said it happened. 
[01:30:00]  What does Rich Voss masturbate to?  Pictures of full frowns.  I'm just going to say that.  Sold out signs.  Third show, eh?  What, at the Trolley Square?  What do I think about?  I don't know.  Ice Guys Comedy Club?  Do you think of us this weekend?  Yeah.  You know you got porno on the laptop, right?  No.  What?  I have no porno.  He used to erase his history.  No, he has to go down in the briefcase.  What else is in the briefcase?  It's old calendars and old different things back in the day. 
[01:30:30]  It's old stuff for me.  I'll bring in the pictures if you want to see some hot girls.  No, I'll bring in the briefcase.  Don't bring in just the photos.  Bring in that fucking briefcase.  We need the briefcase.  Can we go through your briefcase?  That would be hilarious.  Yeah, I'll do that next time.  Keep everything in there.  Try to at least.  I won't touch anything.  I'm sure you'll take some shit out.  I swear to God, I won't even open it.  Dude, how great would that be if he brings his briefcase?  It's not my briefcase for now.  It's from 20 years.  I got it.  That's the beauty of it, is to have it from so long ago. 
[01:31:00]  Move over.  All right, I will.  Oh, boy.  Now you've done it.  Whoa!  Look at this.  All three of us.  You can't sit that close to anybody.  Rich, when you masturbate, you just use your imagination?  I don't look.  I don't like looking at him.  Look at Danny's hog.  Look, he's moving away.  I don't look.  I don't.  I'll touch Jimmy.  Jimmy will touch you.  I look at some pictures.  Jimmy's got such a nice touch.  What are you doing, Rich?  Underwear stuck in my balls. 
[01:31:30]  You know what I mean?  When they creep up on you.  No, because my ass.  My underwear.  I'm sorry.  Are we high and I don't know it?  What the fuck is going on?  Chuckie, Chuckie.  Crack.  Crack.  I couldn't get it out.  No, because my balls don't have a crack in them.  My asshole is what I was trying to say.  I should have just said.  A double?  One of them.  Oh, God.  All right, so you're bringing the briefcase in. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, I'll bring it in.  When?  Next week.  Please.  Let's not wait on this one.  Thanks for nothing.  Nothing.  The Opie and Anthony Show's pre-Thanksgiving live broadcast from the Hard Rock Times Square is coming up shortly.  8 a.m. Eastern.  Here's another helping of the worst of Opie and Anthony while you wait.  As badly as you want to hear what's going on, I'm Sam Roberts, and this is, I'll call it during after, not after, during Opie and Anthony live. 
[01:32:30]  They should be at the Hard Rock by now, getting set to go live for Thanks for Nothing.  We're playing some bits that I like to call actually stalling for time is what we're doing because they had to go from here to there.  And what are we going to put dead air on?  No, not that this is any better, but we'll play some bits.  Opie's, he has a son now.  He has a young boy who he took to see Santa Claus.  Not the real Santa Claus.  Some guy dressed up at the mall as Santa Claus. 
[01:33:00]  But he tells the story of bringing his kid to meet Santa Claus for the very first time.  Something we all can relate to, especially as the holidays approach.  Hopefully, we'll be at the Hard Rock Cafe in no time for Thanks for Nothing.  This could cut off at any minute.  But in the meantime, enjoy Opie taking his kid to meet Santa Claus.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On Sirius XM.  My kid met Santa Claus last night.  What?  For the first time, I would guess. 
[01:33:30]  Opie and Anthony.  All right, we're ready to go.  We're going to cut that off.  I'm sorry if you were enjoying it, but you'll probably enjoy this much more.  We are ready to go live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  Opie and Anthony's Thanks for Nothing special.  We're going live.  Here we go after this.  From the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, New York City,  the Opie and Anthony Show presents  Thanks for Nothing.  With special guests 
[01:34:00]  Bob Kelly and Rich Voss.  Here are your hosts  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Martin.  Ah, welcome.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  Look at how wonderful this is.  Oh, look.  Oh, we're here again.  We're back.  Weren't we just here?  Back again, are we?  We were just here, weren't we?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you, please.  It's much too early for that shit.  That's good. 
[01:34:30]  What?  All right.  Are they already cursing us out?  They're already cursing?  The curtain wasn't even all the way up.  Holy shit.  There's more girls at this event than I've ever seen.  Well, I will say, don't mistake that for a girl.  That's stalker Patty.  That's true.  She's somewhere in between hermaphrodite and disaster.  She's not that bad.  See that bald-headed guy?  That was Bobby two years ago.  Oh, really?  That's good.  We've insulted 30% of the audience.  We have to be nice to everybody here individually. 
[01:35:00]  Well, for the radio audience,  Rich pointed out a guy that's a lot thinner than Bob Kelly.  Yes, which could be any guy in the room.  I'm sorry, Bob.  And Bob Kelly just sat there and took it.  Why would you take that from boss?  I can't believe fucking people showed up.  I'm actually shocked.  And they're sitting.  What happened to ONA fans?  They used to stand in a pit and fucking beat each other up.  Now they're sitting like fucking aristocrats.  Fucking old faggots.  Because everyone's getting old.  Yeah, look at them all.  They're old.  It's a lot more comfortable to sit, isn't it?  This young kid wants to get up. 
[01:35:30]  You don't want to sit.  The old guys made you sit, huh?  Get up.  Stand up.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Hey, be you, man.  He's going to look silly just standing there alone.  Yeah, this is like a Hall & Oates concert.  And you got Hall & Oates at the table here.  Great.  Where's the beer?  You can't drink?  Yeah, again, they pull these shenanigans.  I guess they don't trust you children.  Wait, who said you can't drink?  Why aren't they allowed to drink?  It's policy.  Gary, why aren't they allowed to drink?  It's a bar. 
[01:36:00]  Came from upstairs.  Came from upstairs?  This place doesn't have an upstairs.  Exactly.  That's the roof.  No, they don't.  They think, by the way, they think if you guys had like a couple of drinks in you, it  would be Sodom and Gomorrah.  It would just be pandemonium of ass-fucking and it would just be horrible.  It's a bar.  I know.  Where's Hard Rock, Johnny?  Hard Rock, where are you?  Why can't these people drink?  Yeah.  Chaz.  It's not here.  Look at him.  I, I get it.  Chaz. 
[01:36:30]  Chaz Bono, everyone.  Oh, God damn, Jimmy.  Come on.  Chaz Bono.  Is that on the air?  It's on your side, not mine.  Is that on the air?  I didn't hear it in my headphones.  He just gave the reason, but I don't think they heard it in radio light.  What?  Hard Rock, come on up here.  Yeah, Hard Rock.  What's the reason?  I don't know if that mic's on the air.  Chaz Bono, everyone.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[01:37:00]  Why can't the people drink?  I, I had, I offered it and it was declined from upstairs on your side, not mine.  They really don't trust the audience to, to drink.  Who's fat now?  Like, what do they think is going to happen?  How are you going to make your money today?  It.  Me.  It's eight in the morning.  Hey, can we, can we turn that around?  Gary, where's Gary?  Can we turn that around and get these people some beers?  Oh, you think that.  You think that's going to happen?  This is Gary, by the way, the babysitter. 
[01:37:30]  Yes.  For the people who have never seen him.  Can we turn this around?  Look, they're well behaved.  Let them have a few beers.  Let Heinrich Himmler speak.  They're not driving.  Their parents are picking them up.  I'll buy a couple people beers.  Gary's going to buy a couple people a few beers?  What a nerd.  How many beers are you buying?  But also.  A couple.  Oh, they could buy them themselves.  What does a couple mean?  Couple's two.  I'm good for two.  Two beers.  Wait, no.  Are these people allowed to drink?  I don't think so. 
[01:38:00]  Jesus.  I don't know why we hate this guy, by the way.  Wait, what's the age?  What's the age limit?  Jesus.  Who wants a beer?  Well, you could show ID.  See, look.  Not even.  Only half the audience wants a beer.  They're old enough to drink responsibly.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  Beer.  It really doesn't make any sense.  We will take care of it.  We're going to take care of it, Gary said.  Meaning, move on with the fucking radio show.  Because nothing ever gets taken care of.  Exactly.  All right, whatever. 
[01:38:30]  We're trying to get you guys beers.  We'll see what happens.  Yeah.  Anybody occupying Wall Street?  Who's one of the...  Anybody?  No?  Big protest in the city today.  Anybody working after this?  No.  Wow, four people are working today.  I know.  This is fucking great.  Please tell me you took the day off, at least.  And you're not just all...  You have jobs.  You're all booms.  All right.  There's some lovely girls here.  What's that?  Yes.  There's girls here?  Yeah.  There's a couple.  Yeah.  Lovely ladies. 
[01:39:00]  Anyone you like, Jimmy?  Yeah.  I like...  They're really pretty...  Which one?  I like all of them.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  But what am I going to do?  Point at one, and she's not the one who's going to fuck me.  Is that not?  Well, how about you pick out a few?  Yeah.  There's five on this half of the room.  I like her.  Which one?  Heather Hyde's taken, so she...  I can't...  Who's your friend?  Are you taken?  All right.  I'd fuck you.  That fucking...  Jesus.  You're horrible.  Poor guy right there. 
[01:39:30]  I'm only kidding.  The fucking Unibomber's just got dumped.  The Unibomber?  Fucking Aunt Bob?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You gotta spice up this fucking show somehow.  I'll take the hit.  Aunt Bob?  It's Unibomber, not Unibomber.  I can't...  Yeah.  No, I'm not talking about the same guy.  Oh, it's the other guy.  The Unibomber.  Yeah.  The one that just bombed once.  Like me.  I'm the Unibomber.  Shut up, boss.  Shut up.  Did Patty get her hair dyed for the big event?  Yes.  Hopefully by Oswald.  You've been covering up... 
[01:40:00]  You've been covering up that gray?  Yes, I do cover the gray.  Oh, God.  Our fucking voice.  Yes, I do cover the gray in my pubic region also.  God.  I dye my asshole hair too.  You think she gets her asshole bleach?  Oh, yeah.  At this point.  Bleach that motherfucker.  Do you bleach your asshole, Patty?  What?  No.  Oh, God.  But she bought the wrong dye.  She made it browner.  It happens. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, Patty.  Still a virgin, right?  Nothing's changed?  Nothing's changed.  What are you waiting for now?  Anybody.  I'm waiting until Social Security time.  Only eight and a half years.  Why?  What does that have to do with...  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Birth control?  It means I can finally take a rest.  Are you still working at the Starbucks?  Yes, I am.  And I love my job.  Do you know my wife stopped going to that Starbucks because of you?  She didn't even know you. 
[01:41:00]  Are you serious?  I swear to God.  She goes, there's this fucking lady with a voice.  I don't go there anymore.  She walks five blocks out of her way so she doesn't hear, what can I get you?  Bold or iced coffee?  It's the voice you don't want to hear first thing in the morning.  Oh, God.  It just fucking goes through your brain.  No offense, Patty.  I love you, Patty.  I don't.  Thank you.  How much vacation time you got saved up?  We all know about the Starbucks vacation plan with Patty.  She gets something like five minutes every month.  Well, I got two and a half hours accrued. 
[01:41:30]  And I just used them for my...  Jesus Christ, who you work for, Bank of America?  How long have you been working there now?  Five and a half years.  Six years.  That's great.  Five and a half years and you have two hours accrued.  She talked about it like it's weeks.  So what do you say?  I'm going to take my vacation.  I'll be back in a couple hours?  No, every time I get about four or five hours, I just used them on my paychecks.  That's crazy.  And we were discussing this before we came over here.  This is why we got to occupy.  Yeah.  Take care of Patty. 
[01:42:00]  I accrued two hours.  I plan on taking one during the Christmas vacation.  And then maybe another hour in spring to relax.  She might be taking time right now.  Is this vacation?  No, I'm working tomorrow instead.  What do you do for vacation?  Do you just kind of go to the airport and turn around and come back?  She packs her bags and unpacks them.  Yeah, and she looks at it like a destination on the board.  I'd love to go there.  Okay, back to work.  If I work at Starbucks until 2075.  All right, how long am I going to do the impression? 
[01:42:30]  We got it, Jim.  Do you work full-time at Starbucks?  No, I get about maybe 25 hours, 30 hours a week.  Now, why don't you work full-time?  Although I try to take extra shifts.  Why don't you work full-time?  Because they don't want to.  Because only managers can do that.  Everybody else has to be under.  Ah, why?  Because full-timers get, like, benefits, right?  Well, I still have a 401 and stuff like that.  How much is in your 401?  Maybe about, well, I've been doing it for three years.  Oh.  I got maybe about 2,500 in there for one.  Wow, that's a good retirement. 
[01:43:00]  For that big vacation.  Yeah, that's going to be a good retirement.  Yeah, your retirement's going to rock.  You're ready for Detroit.  Yeah.  Do you get insurance?  Do you get health?  Detroit.  I give it up.  What?  You don't give it up.  You've never done it.  No, I had to give up the health insurance.  I couldn't afford it.  So now I'm on a managed health care program from the city.  It's the only way I can afford it.  Oh, you're on the take.  Oh.  How great would it be if Patty got bilked out of her fucking 401k?  By some swarthy con man.  Some fucking cheap knockoff Bernie Madoff just takes $2,500 at a clip. 
[01:43:30]  The first guy who makes love to her.  He gives her herpes and takes her money.  By that, I mean I'll fuck you.  Rich Voss, everyone.  What's up, Rich?  Same old.  Same old shit.  Yeah.  Same old.  Are you alternative Voss today for everybody?  No, no.  I'm back.  I'm regular Voss.  Regular Voss today.  I like that.  That's a great wig from Gladiator.  You like that?  Marcus Aurelius.  Marcus, watch. 
[01:44:00]  Are you not entertained?  Well, I guess you're not.  By the way, it's also the return of Bobo.  You know.  Where is it?  Oh, exactly.  Oh, God.  He takes his hat off.  It's like he just hit a fucking home run in the World Series.  Bobo, no one cares.  Why did you just tip your hat?  It was obvious they didn't want the tip of the hat.  They wanted you to leave.  Why did you tip your hat, Bobo?  That was just waving. 
[01:44:30]  So in case anybody didn't see me where I'm at.  You're dead center.  How could they not see you?  The whole crowd came in one car.  Why don't they fuck?  Why don't Bobo and that...  What's her name again?  Patty.  Bobo, would you have sex with Stark or Patty?  How could they come looking at each other?  Oh, man.  Would you have sex with Stark or Patty?  Just say yes.  I guess, yeah, yeah.  I guess, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Her nipples are bigger than her tits. 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  But you know what?  Then Patty gets pregnant and then they have a super fan.  Bobo would...  We could just throw shit on him.  Bobo would fuck Sam's hair.  Well, Rich, why do you have to go hurt your feelings?  What's wrong with Sam's hair?  Nothing.  Fucking time of life, Civil War, chest head piece.  Longer.  Make it longer.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  What's wrong with...  This show's getting off to a fucking slow start.  He's making fun of Opie's beard.  He's implying that he looks like he could be some type of a general in the Civil War.  Oh. 
[01:45:30]  Just explaining that bomb.  Oh, all right.  Don't look at me like I'm bombing, too.  Let's just explain his fucking bomb.  I don't like Voss without a goatee.  I don't like...  I don't like him with one, either.  Wait, is that what's going on with you?  Oh, I just...  Yeah, I fucked up.  I was like, I knew something was ridiculous.  I don't like his upper lip.  It's just too big and...  It's like fucking Greg Brady's upper lip now.  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  Oof.  Keep it going.  Wait, you fucked up.  Bobby looks like Joe Coy if he ate Joe Coy.  Pretty good.  That was a good one.  Yeah, well, fat jokes are easy. 
[01:46:00]  Jew jokes are hard.  No, they're not.  That's hilarious.  You think Jew jokes are hard?  Well, yeah.  Not from Anthony.  I know.  And they're not even jokes.  They're just statements with semicolons after them.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  I leave.  We have to pick the contestants for the mashed potato eating contest?  What is this all about?  I don't know.  Well, it's a fan favorite, Anthony.  Is it?  Sam, what's this about?  Well, we have 30 pounds of mashed potatoes. 
[01:46:30]  I'm hungry.  And $500 to give away.  Wow.  Yes.  Damn, that's a lot of money.  So each contestant will be given 10 pounds of potatoes, and whoever can eat the most,  before we're done with the show, will win the $500.  Holy shit.  Bamber.  Well, that sounds fascinating.  You get to pick the contestants, though. 
[01:47:00]  That's something fun for you.  All right.  Yeah.  Is Pat in on this, or what happened?  Pat from Munaki and Big A are both not here.  What?  They couldn't attend.  That makes it a lot.  I mean, that opens up.  Why couldn't they attend?  What are they doing?  They had other things going.  I don't know.  They have nothing.  What is Pat doing?  Falling through the other half of his trailer?  See, because he has holes in the floor.  Yes.  Why don't we, who wants in on this?  That wasn't a weight joke, by the way.  It was a poverty joke.  All right.  We should do a quick interview.  Look at this guy already.  Actually, we only need what?  Three?  Three people.  Oh, boy. 
[01:47:30]  And there's three raised in there?  No, okay.  There's more than two.  There's a dude over there.  A little Mexican dude.  All right.  Bobby, why don't you help us out here?  All right.  I say we pick a thin little Mexican right there.  Well, we got to talk to the guy for a second.  That guy stood up first.  Â¿CuÃ¡l es su nombre?  Hey.  Your nombre is Kevin.  Okay.  See?  He's fucking Mexican.  I know it.  Si.  Hey, huh?  You're Mexican, right?  No, I'm not.  What are you?  Guatemala?  What?  Peruvian.  That's fucking Mexican.  Come on.  Stop.  You guys both have shitty pyramids.  I get that.  They're like the step ones.  A little Pocallipto ones. 
[01:48:00]  Cheating.  Yeah, a little tiny ones.  All right.  Nice talking to you.  I say we take a little thin guy.  Hey, what's your name again?  Kevin.  Kevin, is that your girl behind you?  No.  No.  You work at a restaurant?  No, I used to.  What do you do now?  What do you do?  I work for a limo company.  I don't do dishes.  That's the second stereotype for Mexicans.  They work for a limo company?  Yeah, they drive people.  All right.  And then we take out.  We need a fat guy. 
[01:48:30]  We have one.  Oh, Jesus.  We need one in the competition.  Over there, Bobby.  They're all pointing to this guy over here.  This guy?  This guy standing up.  All right.  What's your name, dude?  Run, Sam.  Run, you little.  You know, our audience is thinner than usual, I'm noticing.  What happens to all the fat guys?  More girls, thinner people.  I like this audience.  Look at all the hot chicks.  Stand up, sir.  What's your name?  Mike.  All right.  Mike?  Easy on the fucking podcast voice.  What would you do with a 500 if you want it?  Go to the bar, because there's no beer here. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  But Gary said he would buy two.  Two beers.  That's great.  Do you think you can win it?  That's what I want to know.  Oh, I think I can.  Do you think you...  Are you going to win it?  I'm going to win it.  You're going to win it.  I like that attitude.  That's a fat guy attitude.  I like that.  What do you think?  Get him?  Good.  You're in.  Now, get this fat guy over here.  Who?  Which one?  Don't turn around, sir.  You know who we're talking about.  How dare you fucking look at that thin table behind you. 
[01:49:30]  Stand up, dude, if you can.  On the one good foot without diabetes.  He's pretty hefty.  What?  No, that's good.  Me and you.  It's all right, buddy.  And what's your name, sir?  I'm Jason from New Jersey.  Jason from New Jersey.  Fucking Jesus.  What?  Don't give us your fucking email address.  I'm Jason from Jersey.  And what do you do?  I'm a customer service rep for a major airline.  Oh, no shit.  What airline?  I'd rather not say.  Why not?  Why?  You're not proud of them?  It starts with a D and ends with a Delta. 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  Oh, you're a Delta.  Can you...  Son of a bitch.  What do you do if someone calls you and says,  there's two bricks of cocaine in my luggage that I didn't pack?  No.  It's a lot of lost luggage.  Is that too new a story to be funny?  Okay.  I stole the paper.  So you think you can win, big boy?  Looking at the two other guys you had.  But I'll tell you this.  Thin guys can eat more than fat guys because there's too much fat.  Because I'm fat.  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  Oh.  Because Bobby ate a thin guy. 
[01:50:30]  I forgot you've been both.  I've been both.  Don't fuck.  You knew I was going to say that.  But he got it before you did.  He got it in before you.  Listen, because the fat is around the stomach,  and it makes your stomach smaller.  This little thin Mexican, wherever he went...  Oh, he's over there.  He's quick.  He's getting ready for the contest.  He had to pick somebody up.  Take your time.  I sit down now.  I want you to know.  He wants to sit down.  Jeez, look at this guy.  He's exhausted from standing.  You're exhausted from standing for eight seconds.  Jesus.  All right, bring him on...  Where are they doing this thing?  Over there.  Right up there. 
[01:51:00]  Right next to you.  Oh.  Where?  Joy.  On that table right there.  Oh.  They get center stage.  You better win.  God, we really do have low self-esteem as a show, don't we?  We're off in the fucking corner.  Yeah, push this off.  And the mashed potato people are in the center of the stage.  Who set that up?  All right.  How did that happen?  The mashed potato people are in the center of the stage.  Well, they wanted to put the real exciting thing center stage.  It's off of video.  And start eating, I guess.  Are we videotaping the play, Sam?  I hope so.  Everything is being videotaped.  Oh, everything. 
[01:51:30]  Yes, because you people are going to be privy to something that's a first.  We will be putting on a production of the first Thanksgiving starring the staff and crew  of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a heartwarming holiday blah-de-blah.  And it's also educational about the first Thanksgiving.  Yeah, yeah, it gives you a little history lesson.  It's wonderful.  And I think Bobo is in it. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yes, he is.  Bobo, you're in this thing.  And so is Stalker Patty.  Do you know your lines, Stalker Patty?  I haven't seen them yet.  I guess that means no.  I haven't seen them yet.  I haven't seen my lines yet.  Who's the other girl at that table?  What's your name, madam?  Yes.  Oh, hi, y'all.  What?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, shit.  Oh, shit.  Just off a bus.  Someone's going to get sexually assaulted today.  I'm Kayla.  Hi, Kayla.  Hey.  Have you been to our events before? 
[01:52:30]  No, this is my first one.  I saw her at Dave's birthday party.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Where are you from?  I'm from South Carolina.  Do you need a place to stay while you're here?  That's sweet, but no.  No, it's not.  It's fucking evil.  I'd be homeless.  That's sweet.  Did you come up for this or other things?  No, no.  I live here now.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, okay.  What do you do, sweetie?  I'm an actress.  Oh, you really?  Yeah.  Oh, you'll get something.  Oh, that's sweet. 
[01:53:00]  Kind of creepy and sweet at the same time.  Anything we've seen you?  Not yet.  Not yet.  Any YouTube videos?  Yeah, anything on fucking X Hamster?  Yeah, it always works out well.  You are naughty.  It always works out well when girls from the South come to the big city to be an actress.  Yeah, it's so stereotypical.  I know.  You're going to hook up with Dustin Hoffman?  That's a Midnight Cowboy joke in 2011.  That's great.  I'm doing jokes over here. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  I said she looks like Feruza Balk.  She's got that smile thing going.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, from the craft.  Yeah, from the craft.  Yeah, you're like Googling it and just put it in my face.  And I was like, okay, nice to meet you.  Yeah, I put it in her face.  Oh, really?  Or a young Tony Soprano sister.  What?  What the fuck?  Why don't you just say Janice Soprano?  No.  Because I don't remember the name.  Why would you say that?  It doesn't look anything like that disaster.  She looks nothing like her.  I just want to look nothing like her.  It's not even close.  You're an asshole.  He said that you look like Janice Soprano. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, it just said she looks like Tony Soprano.  Exactly.  You might as well.  She's very pretty.  I know she is.  You're very pretty.  Yeah, you're very pretty.  Thank you.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No, I do not.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How old are you, first and foremost?  22.  Do you have a job besides acting?  Well, yeah, I'm a hostess.  You're a waitress?  Oh, she's taking her hair back.  I'm sorry, hostess.  Yeah, and apparently I'm not good enough to be a waitress yet.  Well, you'll get there.  Oh, is hostess below waitress?  I hate it. 
[01:54:30]  They make me stand in heels all day.  Isn't this great to watch a bunch of guys try to pick up a girl like this?  Is that what's going on right now?  Yes.  No.  I'm not trying to pick you up.  Don't be delusional.  I was talking to a girl earlier.  I was just talking, and this guy walks by.  He goes, you're married.  What the fuck?  What kind of cock blocker?  Which cock blocker said that?  That guy didn't look fucking peruvian.  That's the ultimate cock block part.  I'm just talking to the blonde, this one that said she wants to pole dance later.  And I was talking to her, and he walks by and goes, you're married.  What are you, my fucking conscience? 
[01:55:00]  Go fuck yourself.  You don't know why I'm married.  Good.  Remember the girls used to show their boobs?  What the hell happened to show?  So now we have you here.  Excuse me, Bob.  Oh.  You forgot to read this.  Yeah, it's a new day and age, Bob.  Okay.  This is what we were told.  Bobo's not allowed to show his penis, and girls are not allowed to flash.  Those are the hard rock rules.  Hard rock rules.  No, no, no, no, no.  Don't get him in trouble, but do it.  No, I understand.  That's why.  Don't you?  Don't I know you?  I grabbed you. 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  We're on the radio, and I have a ring.  Want to settle down, you fucking homewrecker?  Well, you did ask, Bob.  I didn't tell her to rap me out on a fucking national show.  Well, then don't say, do I know you, to a girl.  Well, I, I, I.  What do you do if you're in a rape lineup?  Go, that's her.  Old Polish joke.  She answers her.  That is a great joke.  That's a fucking fuck.  That's her.  But no one heard that.  She answers when you grabbed my boobs.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I had to tell my wife to shut up.  You want to talk to her still?  Yeah, let's find out.  Yeah, she's sexy. 
[01:56:00]  Where did Bobby grab your boob?  On her boob.  The nipple.  But I mean, where was it?  The, the, the 2008, um, at the PNC Bank Art Center, um, the virus show that you guys had.  Oh, well, there was a lot of boob grabbing.  That was a lot.  That was, that was back then.  Were you the, were you the, were you the, we might be, we might all be guilty of that one.  Were you the girl that got taken off in the stretcher?  Because there was a girl who passed out, and we all kind of, she was getting on the, she was getting on the, she said, I'll tell you, okay.  I, that's when Anthony tried to grab my daughter's boob at that fucking show.  I did not.  That was uncomfortable.  Yeah, it was very comfortable for everybody. 
[01:56:30]  Talking to her in your dressing room.  I was trying to make a, uh, rich uncomfortable.  That's all.  You made all of us uncomfortable.  A thousand people on the line.  At least I'm, like, horrified.  Close to white.  Why, did you, I did, it could have been worse.  No, I mean, I'm just saying, it could be bad.  Oh, okay, I got you.  These guys should start eating, uh, mashed potatoes.  Oh, yeah?  Because, uh, we're, we're gonna run out of time.  I don't even see mashed potatoes.  I don't know.  Bring out the mashed potatoes.  Oh, E-Rock knows where they are.  E-Rock knows where they are.  Fuck, you beat me to that one.  Yeah, I got them. 
[01:57:00]  How come at this table we have three men and one woman?  Why is that?  That's your girlfriend?  How come she's not sitting next to you?  Why are the two guys sitting next to you?  Because she's sitting next to his web fucking designer.  Oh, shit.  The Asian gentleman.  Yes, web designer.  Who are the two guys?  Are they your friends?  He's my friend.  I don't know who he is.  That fucking guy just sat at your table and you let that happen?  Look at Blink, motherfucker. 
[01:57:30]  Fucking lunatic.  He's crazy.  He's fucking crazy.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Do you don't know these guys?  No.  He just sat down.  I asked.  There was an open seat, so I sat down.  All right.  They were scared.  He's got an attitude.  He's got an attitude and he doesn't fucking blink.  I'm not fucking with this cocksucker.  I came in.  I fucking sat down.  He's got a fucking six-inch blade in his fucking sock.  Opie and Anthony bibs?  Where did those bibs come from?  Wow.  This is really... 
[01:58:00]  This is wacky.  That's the cruise raises, by the way.  We're bordering on wacky.  This is.  We're bordering on wacky now.  Bordering.  We're well inland.  Next year in October, you guys got to go after yourself.  Nothing.  Wow.  We don't know what...  I don't care.  What do you mean?  I don't even know what you mean.  I'd love it if Bobo's head was in one of those.  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  I want a bib.  Iraq, are they good?  They look good, right?  Yeah.  What are you weighing it for? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Is it weird for you to be holding a half portion?  Jimmy's going to be in Harrisburg this weekend.  Oh.  Unveiling.  We got to weigh it.  Why do they have to weigh the potatoes?  I don't know.  Why don't we do this beforehand instead of on the radio?  Then we know how much they ate.  Oh, to make it official.  How about you weigh it before and we just tell them?  Are they going to disagree with us?  I just hope someone pukes today.  Are they real or instant?  By the way...  The audience.  I know.  That's rude, right?  If you puke, you're out of the contest. 
[01:59:00]  Why?  That's the rules.  Just to keep it all safe, I guess.  Gary.  Jesus.  Let them puke.  Who cares?  I don't understand why they just weighed that.  It was such fucking useless.  Nobody cares.  We're not going to actually...  Is it a certified competition?  Who gives a shit?  I know.  You should have a fat guy puke mashed potatoes.  Yeah.  See how many potatoes are left.  All right.  How is this thing going to fucking run?  I guess we just say go.  Yeah.  All right.  You got to get him pumped up.  Potato eaters, unveil your potatoes. 
[01:59:30]  And there really is nothing more exciting than the sound of mashed potato eating on the radio.  Oh, they got giant wacky spoons, too.  Oh, boy.  This is just a nutty event.  Oh, my God.  By the way, the first guy to puke, I'll give $100 to.  What?  Fuck you.  In payments.  In payments, right.  $10 a year for the next 10 years.  Okay, Starbucks.  No, I'm serious.  Side bet.  First guy to puke gets $100.  Fuck the no puking rule.  Don't worry about it.  Take your lids off. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, take your little lids off of your bananas.  Where do they come from?  They look delicious.  From the ground?  From the hard rock.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  From the ground?  From the ground?  Did you just say from the ground?  Ugh.  Are you all right?  What happened to you this morning?  I wish they had potatoes and they just threw them at you.  Fucking dummy.  They smell pretty good, actually.  Yeah.  Mm.  Oh, they got their water.  They're all ready to go.  Do they get any butter?  Can they get some butter?  No.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Bobby.  Sorry.  I just went into fantasy mode. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, grab your spoons and ready, set.  Hold on.  Wait.  Yeah.  I just wanted to act like I was doing something.  It's all about patience.  Hang on.  Do you want me to time it?  I'll time it.  Do you want me to time it?  This doesn't need to be a time.  I'm just going to fake it and push a button.  No, no.  Wait.  All right.  Why don't you just start?  Okay.  Ready?  Go.  Set.  Go.  Oh, man.  Let's just watch.  They're eating potatoes. 
[02:01:00]  They're eating.  What the fuck?  It just doesn't get any better.  Unfortunately.  What'd you sell them, Jimmy?  Jimmy.  What the fuck is wrong with you, Jimmy? 
[02:01:30]  Oh, if he only did that after every meal.  I think you owe Bob $100, Opie.  Look at this.  That's disgusting.  Oh, God.  Did he puke?  Rinse that out.  I don't want to see it.  Get the fuck out of here.  $100 for Bob Kelly from Opie.  Fuck.  Get out of here.  You really puke.  He hit bonus.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100. 
[02:02:00]  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  $100.  Jimmy showed him a picture of a prolapsed ass.  I just showed him a picture on my iPhone.  It looks like a freshly fucked ass, right?  That's using technology the wrong way.  It pulled the ass out, so it's all pink-socked, and there's jizz around the outside of it. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  I need to see a tit.  Quick.  Take your shirt off.  Ah, fuck.  Nice.  Ah, damn it.  I just did that to get you some money, Bobby.  Money?  Why'd I get money?  Because you're the first one to puke.  Fuck.  Oh, did I win something?  I hope he said the first one to puke gets $100.  Fucking sock it over there, fucking ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  Ginger.  He's got such a delicate stomach when it comes to those, uh...  Delicate stomach?  It's a fucking bloody, bleeding asshole.  Yeah, but that's not... 
[02:03:00]  Who the fuck looks at that and goes, dude, I could look at this and eat cherry jubilee.  It doesn't bother me.  That's because you pay to fucking lick those.  It just doesn't bother me.  Where's my money?  Give me my fucking money.  Damn, you gotta pay fucking Bobby?  Hold on.  Let's get the excitement going again.  They're still eating potatoes.  Oh.  Okay, good.  We're back.  Wow.  I don't like, I don't like, I don't like Obie just whipping money out of his fucking  money bag.  He just threw it at me like a fucking whore.  Like I just sucked his dick in a Volkswagen. 
[02:03:30]  Well, that's a little too real, huh?  Yeah, exactly.  You fucking homeless people.  Pass it on to them.  Why?  What the fuck?  Now Bobby's giving the money away.  Hey, should we, uh...  Wow, this is exactly what Occupy Wall Street wants.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is, uh...  Oh, I've never seen a more kickable fucking person into a friend.  Oh my God, imagine just...  Fucking kicking him right into the crowd.  Look at Patty. 
[02:04:00]  Bob's handing out 20s to a few people.  Should we, uh...  They can't buy beer with it.  Oh, look at that.  Right between the tits there.  That's great.  That's nice.  Yeah, they are.  She has very soft skin.  That's great.  That was a very James Gumm thing of you to say.  Wait a minute.  Should we, uh...  Don't do the impression.  Why not?  I do a very good James Gumm.  That's his impression.  Yeah, why don't you be nice to me?  Sorry, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I love you.  They're eating mashed potatoes.  Of course they are.  We should take a break. 
[02:04:30]  Are we starting the play soon?  Um, is that the grand finale of the play?  So we'll do some karaoke next, right?  Oh, that's right.  I think people are going to do some karaoke.  All right, we'll be back in a few minutes.  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, and everyone else.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  Oh yeah, we're continuing here. 
[02:05:00]  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe in New York City for our Thanks for Nothing Thanksgiving extravaganza, I would call it.  A gala is what this is.  Wait, wait for the big play that we do.  You're going to be stunned at the acting abilities of everybody involved and the story writing.  I believe Sam Roberts and Danny and Travis wrote this, and then our own Jimmy Norton punched it up a little last night, the script. 
[02:05:30]  Yes, I felt a few additions were needed to strengthen the story of Thanksgiving.  And I saw backstage a lot of hustle and bustle going on with the costumes.  Wardrobe.  Costumes.  I saw Bobo getting his makeup done.  Yes, Bobo having his, I'd like to put a little color in his face.  What movie?  Oh, I know.  King of Comedy.  Grease 2.  Oh.  No, King of Comedy.  No, that was like, Grease 2 was I'd like to put a wig on and blow somebody.  I don't know.  Wow. 
[02:06:00]  Wow.  That was so bad.  I actually, it was a really bad Travolta joke.  I was actually praying the mic actually went out for a second.  So is the crowd.  My fucking eyes itch.  It was so bad.  I thought I said it.  At least we got the mashed potato eating contest.  Oh, I was going to say something.  Radio gold.  Radio gold, Jimmy.  I tasted those mashed potatoes.  Of course you did.  Of course you did.  You stepped on each other's good joke.  There's nothing. 
[02:06:30]  There's no salt.  There's no taste to it at all.  There's no butter.  These guys are eating fucking plaster of Paris.  Well, they wanted to put butter and salt on it, but upstairs at Sirius said, no, the cholesterol  and the high blood pressure from the sodium, they don't want to take any chance of a lawsuit.  And they went to the lawyers.  They said, will this be fun?  And when we said yes, they're like, well, then you absolutely cannot do it.  We cannot have any fun.  How do we make it not fun?  Are you enjoying your juice and coffee, faggots?  Yeah.  Salt always makes it not fun.  Wait, but Gary said he would buy a couple of beers.  Yes.  Yeah.  Who got the couple of beers for the big guy? 
[02:07:00]  He's nowhere to be found.  He's already hiding?  Maybe Gary's doing it.  He's just trying to keep it on the deal.  Gary, where are you, Gary?  I know me personally, before I perform and act, which I do quite often, I do like having a nice cold Budweiser.  Also, before you drive.  Oh, right, that too?  Before I drive, before I do anything.  So, boy, if you could make that so, a nice cold Budweiser.  Wouldn't that be great with those potatoes?  Well, go fuck your mother. 
[02:07:30]  Ah, you can't have any.  I bet I can't either.  Why are all the hot girls standing up now?  They're going to do karaoke.  Ooh.  Yes.  Sam, what do we got over there?  Well, we've lined up ladies and gentlemen who want to compete in karaoke for a $250 gift card to I Hate Steven Singer.  Oh.  Yeah.  That Steven Singer just loves giving our show money.  That's right.  It's great.  He should be our boss.  Yeah, right? 
[02:08:00]  But, yeah, they're going to be competing in karaoke.  You guys will pick the best karaoke performance to get the gift card.  I guess he's selling some Argentium over there, isn't he?  You bet he is.  Yeah.  The King of Silvers, Anthony.  Of course it is.  Hey, the actress is over there.  It's brighter than Sterling.  You can sing, too, huh?  Sterling.  No.  Oh, she can't sing.  What?  So, who do you guys want?  No, I'm going to do a duet with Patty.  Oh, great.  A duet.  Let's start with that.  She said she wants to do White Rabbit, so she may have to do a solo.  She can do White Rabbit.  She actually does a good White Rabbit. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, she's terrible.  Yeah, she's in a choral group.  What's that?  She's in a choral group.  She told you all that?  A choral group.  She's a barnacle.  Yeah, we went and got a bagel, and she told me all about it.  I was trying to figure it out.  Thank you.  Aquatic humor.  A barnacle.  No one does ocean humor better than I do.  You're making crustacean jokes.  We're limited by selection.  What?  We're trying to do thanks-themed karaoke songs.  Oh, is that it?  That's right.  How many songs you got in the catalog?  We didn't bring a whole bunch.  Yeah.  There's only so many thank you songs out there.  Yeah, yeah.  We didn't bring the entire library of karaoke music. 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  There's a bit of a limited selection.  Hi, Danny.  Hi, baby.  Hi.  So, who's up first, and what are they going to sing?  This is exciting.  Who wants to go first?  You got girls.  You got Marcos from Yonkers.  You got girls.  Yeah, girls.  You got it.  Girl.  Sam, you pick.  You.  She should come up on stage and take a look at the selection, and then she could-  Yes, come up on stage, look at the selection, and see what's going on.  Rhoda?  Wow, wait.  Oh, damn. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's a good one, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That is a goddamn good one.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll bet you she wrote a book of something.  Fucking Chip.  Fucking Chip.  Fuck Chip.  Fuck Chip.  All right.  Fuck Chip.  Fuck Chip.  You figured out what song you're going to do?  We're going to do Strutter by Kiss.  Strutter by Kiss.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.  You want to get up on a box, or you want to lower the mic stand?  How tall are you? 
[02:10:00]  Fucking 4'2"?  Five feet.  She's five feet.  She's a lovely height.  A little cutie patootie.  Thank you.  Not you.  Her boots are giant.  Are you wearing stockings or pantyhose, or do you just have great legs?  Those boots are.  Stockings?  Where do they come up to?  Are they full pantyhose?  Pirates of the Caribbean boots.  She looks very lovely.  She does look lovely, but the boots go up to her over her knees.  They're not over her knees.  They're just below the knees.  They're just below the knees, Bob.  It's a lot of boot.  How do you want it?  It's a lot of boot.  A lot of boot.  What's wrong with a lot of boot?  We're just saying. 
[02:10:30]  A lot of boot.  That's all.  It's a lot of boot.  What's wrong with a boot?  A lot of boot.  Do you have panties on or nylons?  Yes, I do.  Both?  That's gross.  It would be a hot vagina if you have both on.  Yeah, exactly.  Should we have her lift a dress?  Okay.  She would be happy to.  Do you have panties?  Panties or nylons?  Is that your skin there?  It's stockings.  Oh, you have stockings.  Yes.  Nylons.  Can you lift the dress?  Yeah.  No.  Are you bleeding?  Hey, where'd you get that dress from, Mary?  Shut up.  I can't remember her name.  Fuck Chip.  Fuck Chip. 
[02:11:00]  I forgot her name.  Okay, can we start karaoke now?  No.  No, we have to.  Just stand there more uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  She's a very pretty girl.  I'll say.  You have underwear and nylons on?  He's not leaving.  There's a lot.  You have both on?  Yes.  I'm just saying.  It'd be hard if you were going to have sex.  I'm just telling you.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right, there.  Hot box.  Relax.  All right.  Leave her alone.  So what if her vagina smells like a BLT?  Leave her alone.  I said vagina out of respect.  I think you're very sexy.  I love BLTs. 
[02:11:30]  I love BLTs.  Of course you do.  No doubt.  He has BBBs.  What's that?  Bacon, bacon, bacon.  Am I a dog?  Bacon!  Bacon!  All right.  Let's start the music.  All right.  Let's crank up the music and let's.  Here we go.  All right.  So far, so good.  Hey, I know that program.  It's Paul Stanley today.  Oh.  Whoa.  She wiggles a little.  Oh, yeah.  She's going to dance.  Hope a log drops out. 
[02:12:00]  Turn up the lollipop a little bit.  Oh.  Oh.  I know a thing or two about her.  I know she'll only make you cry.  That was good.  She'll let you walk the street beside her.  But when she wants, she'll pass you by. 
[02:12:30]  Everybody says she's looking good.  And the lady knows it's understood.  Strutters.  She's like a child.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Yeah, wiggle back.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  I'm actually pinching my shaft.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, she's having fun.  Hey, put your eyes back in for Tata, guys. 
[02:13:00]  She wears her set.  Tata eyes, get it?  Like a lady.  Ooh.  Get the crowd into it.  She gets her way.  Yeah.  Where'd you get that dress?  The love boat?  You take her home.  And she says, maybe.  Maybe.  Oh.  She takes you down.  And drives you wild.  Everybody says she's looking good. 
[02:13:30]  And the lady knows it's understood.  Strutters.  And the crowd is going crazy.  It's like they're watching a PBS documentary.  It's insane.  Yeah, it's insanity here.  It's like this Church of Scientology in here right now.  How many full songs are we going to play?  That's good.  We might want to edit these and do like a two minutes.  Good job.  Good job.  Good job.  Good job.  Let's hear it.  Good job.  Yay. 
[02:14:00]  Strutters.  Good job, Jimmy, with the suggestion.  Yeah.  That's good.  That was good.  Think about backwards.  That's cool.  That was almost like kiddie porn.  You look very good.  Rich is fucking spitting it.  Unbelievable.  That was actually.  Hey, where'd you get that dress, Sanford and Son?  Shut up.  All right.  Chip.  Chip.  Shut up, fucking Chip.  I got better ones than Rhoda.  You said Rhoda.  That was stupid.  No, that was actually funny.  I thought she was good.  Yeah, that was good.  She was good.  A lot of energy.  Very good. 
[02:14:30]  She had the energy.  You know, she's moving around, not just standing by the mic.  Not only did she have pep in her step, but her asshole almost tumbled out.  I think that deserves a round of applause.  You've got to love that, right?  She's going to be tough to beat.  Yeah.  Sam, who do we have next?  Who's next, Sam?  Well, there's a couple guys who want to.  Let's get a guy up here.  Let's get some cock up on the stage.  All right.  Yeah.  Because it's not enough.  All right.  Cock.  Well, there's Marcos from Yonkers.  There's also, as Kenny described, a disgruntled retard who wasn't picked that wants to participate.  But he can't because he's playing the turkey.  Well, let's talk to Kenny. 
[02:15:00]  We haven't talked to Kenny yet here at the Hard Rock.  What's going on, Kenny?  I met a friend.  What happened?  Who, is it Justin Volpe?  No.  This is my new friend, Jordan.  Say hello to Jordan.  Hi, Jordan.  I mean the country.  He's very upset he didn't get picked for karaoke.  Why are you upset, Jordan?  I'm not upset.  Oh, now he's not upset because he's in line. 
[02:15:30]  No, I'm not upset.  I'm trying to get you to the front of the line.  Are you upset or not?  No, I'm not upset.  All right.  You're not singing.  Oh, Kenny.  What song did you want to do?  What song did Jordan want to do?  What's in there?  He's not even prepared.  Oh, boy.  He didn't even know.  Yeah.  This is horrible.  Yeah.  How about we go with the actress in Stalker Patty?  Yeah.  We might have.  Yeah.  We got to save them.  We just lost Patty to wardrobe.  Oh, to wardrobe.  Oh, what about an actress?  Go ahead.  You want to go solo actress?  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Go for it.  Go for it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bring Andy McDowell up here.  Come on.  You lovely girl.  What are you going to sing?  Look, I like that.  What?  Do a duet.  All right.  Jeez.  I bet they do Paradise by the Dashboard Light.  Hey, where'd you get those shirts, Chico and the man?  See, you're not making any sense now.  Yes, I am.  God bless.  Just name a 70s shirt.  God bless the middle one.  Wow.  That's Brie.  Jesus.  Brie.  I know.  People know Brie.  I know.  Hi, Brie.  Brie likes showing off her boobies. 
[02:16:30]  Yes, she should.  I bet you two look the same naked.  Did you hear nothing?  That's terrible.  Did you hear what Anthony?  You fucking can't take it.  What did he say?  I didn't hear it either.  He said, I bet you.  I heard him.  Fucking God damn it.  So what song are you gals going to?  We're going to do Jingle Bell Rock.  Jingle Bell Rock.  All right.  I hate that song. 
[02:17:00]  No, that's good.  It's Christmas.  It's Christmassy.  I want to hear something that fucking Bing Crosby used to assault his kids with a fucking tire iron to.  That's wonderful.  All right, I apologize.  Christmas.  You know, it's right around the corner, as they say.  I'm sorry.  Let her rip.  You have a nice rump.  A little Hanukkah.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  She's got a nice hair.  That's a shelf hiney.  A shelf hiney?  Yeah.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, boy.  Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock.  Oh, thank you.  Jingle Bell Spring.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  The crowd turned on him pretty quickly.  Well, let's get the...  Hold on.  Let's get the...  I'm booing this song.  Jingle Bell has begun.  Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell, Jingle Bell Rock.  Jingle Bell's shining.  Jingle Bell time.  It's like Christmas at a...  You have to go in clinic.  Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square. 
[02:18:00]  Jingle Bell Square.  In the frosty air.  Oh, God.  What a ride.  Ugh.  Go ahead.  Let her rip.  Go ahead.  What a nice man.  Oh, boy.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Go ahead.  Tough it out.  Tough it out.  Keep going.  Keep going.  This is like a rich ball show.  Just sing louder.  I never get this many people.  Keep going.  Tough it out.  You want to be in the business?  This is how you're in the business.  I hate the jingle horse. 
[02:18:30]  You don't like the jingle horse?  No.  Let's get a video in Seattle.  That's what happens when you put bells on rich.  Jingle horse.  Come on.  Focus.  Look at the music.  Look at the music.  You know what?  Come dance.  Dance.  Do something.  You're like fucking...  You don't just stand there.  Dance.  Do some fucking...  All right.  How about...  Oh, Bobby's up there.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:19:00]  Jingle bell time.  It's like fussy.  I'm fast.  Jingle bell...  Kitty up...  Jingle elephant.  Kitty up elephant.  Take.  Jingle.  Jingle.  Jingle.  It's the jingle.  That's the jingle.  Keep singing, bitch.  Good job, Bobby. 
[02:19:30]  Bobby, good job, Bobby.  Bob Fosse stepping in and saving the day.  Good job, Bobby.  I hope he winds up the same way as Bob Fosse.  Yes, dead.  Marie, I wish I looked like her.  I'd fuck myself all the time.  Oh.  You like the big-titted one?  Yeah, I like it.  He's asking her.  See, Jimmy was implying I was asking her if she liked the big-titted one,  who would have been Bob Kelly? 
[02:20:00]  See, Jimmy made a good joke.  Too good.  They can't hear without alcohol.  Something happens to the eardrums.  They're all crusty.  They need some lubricant.  I asked for a bud for myself.  That's much better.  Let's see.  That's great.  It's called the Anthony Kuma starter kit right there.  Who's Anthony Kuma?  Kuma.  Bob Kiley.  Kuma. 
[02:20:30]  Ah, that's good.  Should we move on to the next one?  Yeah, let's do it.  Very good job, ladies.  Good job, ladies.  Very good.  They're right in front of you there, Rich.  Where'd you get those shirts?  Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?  No.  Fucking chip.  Crazy.  That was a very good rendition there, ladies.  Good job.  I'm not.  You girls want some egg whites?  Oh, shit.  Maybe I shouldn't be filming this.  Wow.  Bobby really does seem to enjoy the company of that young lady.  Let's go.  Who doesn't?  Hi, girls.  This has the sex appeal of the fucking big fight and escape from New York. 
[02:21:00]  Snake plus chip.  Fucking who?  Fucking.  That was pretty sexy.  Who's winning the competition?  Oh, shit.  Does anyone care?  This guy's rocking it?  Uh-oh.  What are you doing?  Let's talk to him.  Are you sweating?  I'm like that close to him.  You're close to puking?  Well, please, uh...  Get another giant spoonful in you.  Go ahead.  Just...  Just...  Oh, yeah.  Get it in there.  Get it in there.  You're good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no, no. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's eating.  Oh, boy.  What kind of show is this?  Do we have a camera on here?  A video camera?  Are you, like, gagging from it?  Is it all...  Is it in the back of your throat just making you, like, gag?  Eat the potatoes.  Eat your potatoes.  I'll kiss you later.  I'm eating a potato.  He kiss you later.  I'm eating a potato.  You all right? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, shit.  He's...  Oh, he's dry heaving.  Oh, shit.  He's dry heaving.  That's going to look like a Play-Doh Fun Factory when it comes to shooting out of his mouth.  Quick, Vos, show him your acting reel.  You're not really eating much of that.  You're kind of chewing it out of your...  Yeah, there you go.  Now he's chowing down.  How come you're going to get sick?  I don't like potatoes.  Oh, oh, he's dry heaving.  He's putting water.  That dry heave is the worst. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, God.  He's dry heaving.  He's dry heaving mashed potatoes.  Yeah, dry heaving mashed potatoes is rough.  Dry mashed potatoes.  Oh, oh, oh, he's gagging.  He's gagging.  This is terrible.  I don't like that nobody wants me...  Fuck, you want me to puke, too?  You all right?  It's like watching someone give birth.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so thick, the potatoes. 
[02:23:00]  It's probably hard to get potatoes out.  It's viscous.  Right?  Yeah, it's very, very...  I can't wait for you to shit a white shit.  Oh, it's going to look great.  Big rope.  Big white nylon rope is going to come out of his asshole.  Oh, how is that?  Yeah, show him the picture of your asshole, Jimmy.  Come on, oh, he's digging in with verve.  Oh, boy.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He's puking.  He's dry heaving.  Oh, wait, wait.  No, he's not going to puke.  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:23:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Yeah, we have a go.  Oh, he's straining.  Look at his face.  Oh!  It's so difficult.  Yes, he is.  And Bobby's puking.  Bobby, here's a bucket.  Bobby, up here.  Bobby is also vomiting.  Bobby's walking around the audience.  He's running through the crowd like a wild bull.  He's running around the audience puking.  It's like an elephant has escaped from the zoo.  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:00]  Bobby just walked through the crowd vomiting.  Jesus, Bobby.  Like a fucking elephant that runs through a crowd.  Oh, Bobby, you didn't like watching him vomit all those potatoes up.  Bobby!  We got to have a video camera on this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I think they got a long shot over there.  Oh!  Oh, he's hurting.  He's hurting.  You can see his whole face turn red. 
[02:24:30]  Fucking.  And potatoes are really thick to puke up.  Yeah, those are really delicious.  That's very difficult.  You all right?  They don't want to come up, right?  Drink more water.  That'll loosen it up a little.  He's already out.  He puked.  Yeah, but he don't care.  I like how he puked in the potato bowl, and he's eating the potatoes.  That guy's a fucking trooper.  He's a champion.  You are a champ.  He's a champion.  If any... 
[02:25:00]  If the use of the word champion...  He's a champion.  Yes, that had...  The same part is he's...  Oh, no.  Hold on, hold on.  Fingers down the throat.  He's woofing.  I think the water is on top of the potatoes.  Yeah, you can't get it to saturate the potatoes.  You're like a puke parfait.  Uh-oh.  He's trying.  Nah, it's just water.  People make dumb faces when they puke, don't they?  Exactly.  I think the dumbest face is probably coming, and then puking, and then crying. 
[02:25:30]  Or shitting.  Yes.  Especially if all four are at the same time.  At the same time.  He's fucking hurt.  Where's Bob?  Bob, come back up.  Bobby, what's wrong with you, Bobby?  Stop running around.  Bobby's running around the crowd.  What the hell happened?  Something just got him.  What got him?  What got you?  Oh, he just showed him a picture.  Now Bobby's puke in the audience.  Bobby's in the crowd growing up. 
[02:26:00]  Bobby got fucked so bad, a fan goes, hey, Bobby, Bobby, and then showed him another picture.  And he had another picture.  Another horrendous picture.  He puked on the stage.  You're right.  Bob left the stage.  He was running around the audience.  Yeah, like when one of those bulls at a bullfight jumps the fence.  Oh, shit.  That's an awful picture.  Oh, God.  Is that a terrible one?  Looks like Mick Jagger is hanging out of an asshole.  Giant red prolapse.  That's from Bobby.  Oh, that is terrible.  All right.  I don't want to look at Bobby's puke. 
[02:26:30]  That's terrible.  Now what?  Back to karaoke?  Wow.  We got to save some time for the big play.  The worst job.  What happened?  Oh, God.  He's still puking.  Oh, that's Matt the intern, by the way, for anyone that needs a visual.  He's cleaning up Bobby's puke.  A perfect job for Matt the intern.  Team Matt.  Yes.  The worst job in the fucking world, dude.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry, dude.  Occupy that towel, you fucking hippie. 
[02:27:00]  Sorry, dude.  He's used to puke and shit being down there in that shithole.  What a good-looking kid.  Probably went to college.  Had hopes and dreams.  What?  I think one of these girls should give you a handjob after the show.  How about you start with getting me a handjob, fucking shithead?  I'll give you a handjob.  He'll give you one, yeah.  Thank you.  It's kind of different.  I'm lonely.  Wow.  All right.  Can we get one more karaoke?  One more karaoke. 
[02:27:30]  And then, of course, the extravagant event.  We've got two options.  One guy wants to do Rooster.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  The other guy, Jordan, Kenny's friend, wants to do Sweet Caroline.  Oh, boy.  Oh, well, you know what?  Well, we might as well.  Let him do it.  We have a point of reference with Anthony.  Sweet Caroline.  Yeah, go ahead.  You better get your kneel on.  Get your kneel diamond on, yo.  You do this often? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, I'm a professional.  He's got the deep voice.  Oh, that's why you wanted to sing.  He's a professional.  That's why he got all pissy with Kenny.  Yeah, it wouldn't be possible for Dynamic Limo to give me the money to come here today.  Oh, yeah?  So I want to...  All right, good.  No, no, no.  I'm sorry.  It's just...  People love life.  I'm going to sing this song right now.  You're winning over the crowd.  He looks like an owl.  This guy...  Where'd you get that shirt from?  Hello, Larry?  That's all right.  You can keep the insults coming.  I can take them.  I'm a comedian as well.  You're a what?  You're a what?  A comedian. 
[02:28:30]  You're a comedian as well?  Where do you gig?  Not around you.  Oh!  Anthony, how did that feel?  What did that mean?  That was very funny.  What did that mean?  That was a zing right at you.  Fucking retard haircut.  What did that mean?  I think he got you, Ant.  He doesn't gig around you.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  You can say anything to me in the world.  I got picked on when I was a kid.  Really?  You can say anything to me.  I will not be offended.  No.  Really?  Then I won't.  Well, how about we have the audience say some things to him? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anybody want to say anything to this guy?  Jordan?  Before he sings?  Do you want to sing up in a tree or do you want to sing here?  Let's hear him sing.  He might be very talented.  There's no reason not to let the guy sing.  He loves to sing.  He's up here to sing.  Let me get the song started and get us over with so you can do your play.  Oh, man.  This guy's obnoxious.  I don't want to take up any more time.  That's all.  That's all right.  I wanted to hear a fat man with Asperger's sing a song.  Jesus.  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  Look at this toast happening.  Picked on his whole life. 
[02:29:30]  Sing it.  Sweet Caroline.  I hope it's great.  Yes.  Where it began.  Oh, God.  Oh, he's not bad.  I can't begin to know it.  Fucking martini from Cuckoo's Nest.  And I know I was growing strong.  He's good.  Wasn't a spring.  Oh, God.  And spring became summer.  He's crooning.  Who'd believe you'd come along. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  I think he's very good.  Hands.  Touching hands.  Touching kids.  Yay.  Reaching out.  Jesus.  Touching me.  Touching you.  Go to the crowd.  Go to the crowd.  Come on, singer.  Sweet Caroline.  It's all over the place.  Good time never felt so good. 
[02:30:30]  I've been inclined.  Where's the crowd?  Do you believe they never were now?  Come on.  You stand there like the Manchurian candidate.  Look at the night.  Turn around.  And it don't seem so lonely.  There you go.  He's getting comfortable.  We put it up with only two. 
[02:31:00]  Who made your belt?  Goodyear?  Use that.  See, I'm implying it's attire.  And when I hurl, hurting runs off my shoulder.  Right onto his tit.  How can I hurl when holding you?  Ah.  Warm.  Touching warm.  Oh, God.  Timing.  How about some timing on this?  Reaching out.  Are you guys really putting up with this?  Wait until the words highlighted.  Touching me. 
[02:31:30]  He's going it his way.  He's very good.  Touching you.  This is very good.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never felt so good.  No, he doesn't.  I didn't plan to believe I never would.  Oh, no, no. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, where'd you get that shirt, Bonnie Miller?  Oh, I got it as a birthday present for your mom.  Oh, boy.  Good one.  Nailed it.  My mother's a saint on earth.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never felt so good.  Sweet Caroline.  We hate them.  I believe they're never good. 
[02:32:30]  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never felt so good.  Sweet Caroline.  I believe they're never good. 
[02:33:00]  Open hand for a saint.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Thank you.  Good day, sir.  I thought you did a pretty good job.  I thought it was good.  It wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  Any more jokes?  Good job.  Sweet Caroline.  Good times never seemed so good.  Children, children.  You didn't like that version, Anthony?  It stunk.  It didn't sound like Neil.  Yes, it did.  No, it didn't.  Jordan.  I did a little bit.  Where'd you get your shirt, CPO Sharky? 
[02:33:30]  I got him back.  How do you feel you did there, Jordan?  Let's see where you are in 10 years, Jim.  Oh!  Oh, yeah?  Let's see where you are.  Oh, shit.  Totally nailed you.  I'm going to be making a hell of a lot more money than you.  Oh, yeah?  And I'll be bigger than you are, and I'll make more money than you, and I'll be more famous.  What are you going to buy with the money?  All right, Rupert Pumpkin.  Wait, I got a good hammer. 
[02:34:00]  What are you going to buy with all that money, a new hat or something?  Good one, Jim.  Thanks.  It was good.  Thanks.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Where do you gig?  Give a plug.  What do I gig?  Yeah, where do you gig?  Can I plug?  Am I allowed to plug now?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, wouldn't it be possible for me to come today if it wasn't for Lulu's Village Pub in Port Jefferson?  Lulu's Village Pub?  That's it.  That's just like Caroline's.  Is that closer to Comedy Connection in Providence, Rhode Island, where I'll be this weekend? 
[02:34:30]  Oh, fucking gosh.  You're a funny guy.  No, you're a funny guy.  It's in Port Jefferson, New York.  Which is right across from the bitch, Port Barry.  God, he's so hateable.  He really is.  He's starring in the owl.  He came up all defensive and obnoxious.  We were going to have fun, but oh my God, this guy stinks.  You're terrible.  No, he's starring in the owl and the pussycat.  Yeah, where did you get your shirt from?  Petticoat Junction? 
[02:35:00]  That's it.  I don't like to be so ruthless.  You are.  You're obnoxious.  I think you have this grandiose, self-important attitude.  But he was good.  He was really good.  I'm not a self-important person.  If you get to know me in real life before you judge me, so shut the fuck up.  I didn't fucking do that.  He's right.  Hey, shithead, you're wearing my picture around your neck, faggot.  Remember that.  Remember that.  Yeah, but you should get to know him first. 
[02:35:30]  He's right.  I know him.  He's an asshole.  You're an asshole, too.  Yeah.  Oh!  He rubbered.  I glued you.  And I get paid for it.  What?  You suck more black cock than Kim Kardashian.  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Oh, snap!  Is that the kind of stuff we'll get at the wacky hut in Port Jeff?  Yeah.  Well, he's lucky if he gets to do all that.  Wow.  What do you entertain?  The fucking Bridgeport and Port Ferry people?  Oh, shit.  Bridgeport.  You fucked up.  It's all right.  Bridgeport Perry people. 
[02:36:00]  You're up against a professional.  He made you nervous.  That is true.  He shook me up a little bit there.  Go ahead, Jordan.  Fucking take his head off again with another verbal zinger.  That's all right.  Go ahead.  No, I think I'm done.  Let's get on with the show.  Attaboy.  All right.  Jordan wants us to get on with the show.  He's right.  Wait, Sam.  Sam, are we done with karaoke?  We need to name a winner.  There's a gift card that needs to be given.  Oh, wow.  Strutter.  I go with Jordan.  Yeah, we gotta give it to the girl.  Strutter.  All right, Strutter.  Give it to Phyllis.  Well, why don't we have a vote?  Oh, God.  How about we vote?  Let's vote.  Yeah, everybody.  I say it's between Strutter and this Jordan character. 
[02:36:30]  And we'll let the audience decide.  Jordan, get on stage.  Jordan, get on stage.  Come up here.  Oh, boy.  I don't like these things.  I know, right?  And then we got the guy puking over here.  Oh, that was the money shot.  Oh, shit.  That was the money shot.  He just puked up those potatoes.  I guess they finally loosened up.  No shit.  Those potatoes loosened up, man.  Wow, did they come out.  You all right, Rich?  You gonna puke? 
[02:37:00]  Look at the plate.  Oh, shit.  It's like gravy's in there now.  Where's Bobby?  Where's Bobby?  Bobby!  Yeah.  Bobby, look at where Bobby is.  That's disgusting.  Watch you don't get raped.  See, I'm implying he's a rapist.  We got the guy puking.  We got to get a winner for this damn thing.  All right, let's just do a quick winner.  Everybody in favor of...  Who should we do first, though?  Jordan.  Jordan.  Everybody in favor of Jordan?  Jordan.  Jordan.  Wow.  This is uncomfortable.  Everybody in favor of the lovely girl who sang Strutter? 
[02:37:30]  Well, boy, it's close, but...  That was a close one, I got to tell you.  Yeah.  Let's do it again.  Let's do it again.  We'll give it to the Strutter girl.  Oh, shit.  What was that?  You just threw your iPhone, dude.  You broke it.  I know.  I guess it's funny.  Wait, that's not even your phone?  Is there a picture?  It's probably a picture of his cock on it.  He wanted to just...  Oh, my God!  What is it?  What is it?  What's on the phone?  I'm going to smash this phone right now.  What happened?  What is it?  Oh, my God!  What was on it? 
[02:38:00]  What was it?  Let's see.  Don't show the fucking thing.  Oh, I know what you wanted to do.  It's anticlimactic now.  I know what it was.  No, I can't come.  You've got to come here.  What's it?  Yeah, what was it?  It was a picture of a...  I know this cock sucker.  It was a picture of an asshole with, like, a needle or some dirty thing to make me puke.  Yeah, it didn't work, though, obviously.  Bobby's on to you.  All right.  I'm on to you.  I think at this point, Bobby's on to you.  Let's open his text messages to Jerry Sandusky.  All right, Strutter wins the karaoke contest.  He's here for Strutter.  We got the dude that puked over there. 
[02:38:30]  I think he's technically out of the competition, but God damn, was that great?  Okay, can we get a...  That stinks now over there, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Why don't we break, and then we'll do the big thanks.  It's got to do the big play.  Hope's right.  Time to do the play.  We got the play next.  Yes.  It's going to be terrific.  And then maybe Santa Claus to wrap up our live broadcast.  Oh, boy.  From the Hard Rock Cafe.  The Anthony Show is live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  Real city.  Thanks for nothing and genius.  Genius.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:39:00]  We're live at the Hard Rock Cafe.  We've got a great audience today, and so far we've had absolutely a lot of fun.  This guy is stretching because he promised me he would puke for everybody.  We have to stretch to puke?  Are you going to puke right this minute?  I can, but he's not going to stop if I do.  Can we not?  Oh, all right.  He wants to win.  You don't want to lose the contest.  All right, keep eating the mashed potatoes.  It's up to you, too.  Hard-working Mexican.  I like it.  Also, Pat Duffy's in the audience.  He wants to come up and say hi in a little bit.  And then we've got Santa Claus. 
[02:39:30]  But we're moving into the play.  The play, Ope.  And me and you promised foley work.  We're the producers.  We're the producers?  Yeah, we're producers.  I like this.  I like it.  We're going to do foley work.  Yeah, we got Roland, Anthony, Stalker, Paddy, Rich Vosch, Bobo, Chip.  Something's going down.  Wait a minute.  What's going on?  Something's going down.  Why are you positioned like that?  I'm hoping you come behind me, Bobby.  Oh.  You want me to fuck you in the ass? 
[02:40:00]  That'll make me puke for sure.  You're not going to feel much.  I got like a five and a half.  Are you going to puke?  You good?  All right.  I was kidding.  I'm doing a few videos here.  We don't want to miss the money shot like we missed with the first guy.  I love that on this show, the money shot is a guy throwing up.  Yeah, of course.  Fucking homo show.  Are you guys ready for the first Thanksgiving?  Yes.  Yeah?  An O&A production?  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage, your narrator, Roland. 
[02:40:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  That's how Roland was walking around today, by the way.  It's cold in New York, but not for Roland, who's in shorts and a t-shirt.  Are you Samoan?  What nationality are you?  It's hot out there.  What are you?  What nationality?  Mexican.  You're Mexican?  Really?  Do you remember how he says it, though?  You missed it?  How do you say it?  Mexican.  Mexican?  Mexican. 
[02:41:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  All right.  Roland's going to play the part of the narrator.  All right.  Many, many years ago, the pilgrims came to America.  Wait, wait.  Wait.  Many, many years ago, the pilgrims came to America for the very first time.  They sailed on the big ship.  They called, oh.  Is that they called?  The Mayflower.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Is anyone videotaping this?  What the fuck? 
[02:41:30]  Move out.  Is anyone videotaping this?  I don't know.  Yes.  Yes.  They're videoing all over.  No, like someone from our show.  Yes, all over.  Ope, see the cameras?  Oh, okay.  There's three-camera shoot.  All right, because, you know.  Hey, you're the producer.  Well, that's why I'm producing right now.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I want to make sure the radio people get to see this someday.  Well, good.  All right.  Start over.  This is the official start of the first Thanksgiving.  Roll it.  Take it.  Action.  All right.  Many, many years ago, the pilgrims came to America for the first time. 
[02:42:00]  They sailed on the big ship that they called the Mayflower.  Anthony and Stalker Patty are on stage now.  I can't wait to get to our new home.  It's my new home.  I earned all the money that paid for this shit that got us here.  You're just occupying this new land and not contributing.  It took courage across the ocean.  They're mini-dangerous.  What's that ahead? 
[02:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Blacks.  Pilgrim Patty, those aren't blacks.  They're savages.  Savage red natives who we must conquer.  They must be destroyed.  Ping, ping, ping.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Ah, ah.  Oh.  When they landed in America, the pilgrims needed food to eat and clean water to drink. 
[02:43:00]  Except for the oldest, creepiest pilgrim, who only needed a case of fire water to guzzle  the journey of his podcast.  They looked long and hard for fresh food in the forest and mainly gathered seeds and berries  to eat.  The first winter in America was long and hard.  Oh, may I have some of your seed, Pilgrim Anthony?  Get the fuck away from me, wench.  I'll shoot you dead.  Dead!  But I'm hungry.  I need something more to eat.  So work for it.  Many of the pilgrims became ill. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, goodness, Pilgrim Patty, you're looking even worse than usual.  Yes, I feel so ill.  It must be from all the fucking I've been doing with the native animals.  Last night, Geronimo's horse stepped on the side of my face while he was balls deep into  my shit maker.  Fucking Christ.  She looks like a ghost. 
[02:44:00]  Finally, the winters passed and spring came.  The pilgrims rejoiced.  Yay!  One day, a kind Indian came to the pilgrim's village.  He liked the pilgrims and wanted to chip in.  What's that?  He liked the pilgrims and wanted to chip in.  What's that?  He really am.  He liked the pilgrims and wanted to help.  Helped? 
[02:44:30]  What is he, a Beatles record or something?  Soon more Indians came.  I hope they were using rubbers or something.  And I wonder if all the Indians were from Cleveland.  I can't eat asparagus because it makes my teepee smell.  I got so many feathers on my head, it looks like a bunch of birds are doing the Watusi or something.  As I was saying, soon more Indians arrived, and the boy, were those Indians a bunch of dummies. 
[02:45:00]  The smallest of Indians was called Bobo.  He was their special friend.  The Indians and pilgrims agreed to live in peace and harmony.  Christ on a pony, a shrunken-headed little monster, a horribly run-into-the-ground character, and a retarded Jewish Indian chief. 
[02:45:30]  I think I just discovered Long Island.  All we're missing is a 500-pound stutterer with apple butter in his arteries.  Yeah, that's right.  Hey, what, do you need help or something?  No, thank you, Indian. I'm fine.  Yeah, you look pretty good.  Must have been a grim pill you swallowed to be a pilgrim.  You're a pretty funny Indian.  What's that? 
[02:46:00]  You're a pretty funny Indian.  Yeah, I'd like to cut your tits off.  Jesus.  Because they're small and stupid.  Not like my mutters, which are big and full of milk.  The pilgrims and the Indians learned to negotiate together.  Ah, hey, can we buy all this land from you guys?  We're prepared to offer you a mouthful of drool, a mangled penis, and smallpox. 
[02:46:30]  Well, if you throw in some acting classes and a feeding bag I could eat oats out of, you've got a deal.  He stinks at acting.  Yeah.  Hold on, that's my line.  And a drier door, too, or something.  See, that would have been much better, but he stepped... 
[02:47:00]  One Indian became so excited about the New Deal, he achieved a full erection.  Oh, it's a deal.  No!  Oh, right here.  Oh, sorry about that.  Until later on, when the Indians realized he had been taken advantage of. 
[02:47:30]  All right, take this.  You dumb phones.  Hey, Pilgrim Anthony, you ripped me off.  I want my freaking land back, all right?  Uh, yeah?  Well, I want you to replace the boots I ruined when I stepped in a pile of Mr. Maloonigan's shit.  Fuck you, and fuck your hyperallergenic dog.  Aw, shit. 
[02:48:00]  Fuck, fuck, yo!  Some Foley artist.  Bang!  Bang!  Ah!  And then the Green Ripper makes his first appearance of the Thanksgiving holiday.  Bobo is dead and being carried off stage by a close-to-the-caddy.  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Help me!  Help me!  I'm retarded! 
[02:48:30]  Now I have paint all over my shitty big suit.  Kenny's not going to be happy with that.  There's paint all over his shoulder.  There's paint all over my suit.  Who's going to pay for this?  All right, uh...  Once that problem was solved, they became worried about the approaching winter.  Shh!  Jeez!  It's getting breezy.  Like, I don't know, there's a breeze in here or something?  I don't know.  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh! 
[02:49:00]  Here's the thing.  Shh!  Speak up!  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  My wigwam...  Shh!  My wigwam burned down because my wife got distracted.  Blame!  You suck at acting.  Excuse me.  I'm getting emotional here.  The thing is, my wigwam burned down because my wife got distracted while she was fucking  three warriors from the Wu-Tang tribe.  If we all work together, I can rebuild my poorly furnished home and afford to have her 
[02:49:30]  vagina stitched back to a size I can use again.  We need to pull together.  Can you say stitched again?  Stitched.  You want to pull something?  Why don't you pull some taffy or something?  Jesus Christ.  Well, Mitch, maybe you can pull something heavy?  I don't know what's heavy.  Something like that.  Hey, you know what?  You need to stop your horrible jokes and get your shit together.  What are you going to...  I can't see you.  Let me get my glasses.  Hold on. 
[02:50:00]  Hold on.  Okay.  I told you we shouldn't have had any Jews in this play.  What are you going to tell us next?  That if the Jews walked two more miles, we'd have all the oil?  This is our time.  This is when we separate the men from the boys.  What, are they stuck together or something?  You got to separate them?  They stuck together like this taffy on them?  Together, the pilgrims and Indians hunted quail and turkey so they would be ready to... 
[02:50:30]  Oh, so they'd be ready for the...  That's what I do when I see food.  I...  Oh, shit.  Hey, look.  It's a pig with feathers.  No, no.  It's a huge, fat, meaty, worthless turkey that doesn't deserve to be alive. 
[02:51:00]  It looks stupid and lazy, but there's just so much meat.  Without question, this clearly metaphorical turkey would serve to satisfy us greater in death.  I'm from Florida!  I have conquered the largest, fattest, dumbest, laziest, least heterosexual turkey any of us has ever seen. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, we will dine like kings.  Someone get my knife so I can cut off its hooves and pickle them.  Eat me!  Eat me and stuff me with your fists!  Treat me like the fat, blundering turkey I am!  Fill me up with your deliciousness!  Jesus!  Jesus!  Boy, this turkey is...  This turkey is fucking fat!

[03:05:00]  a petrified nugget  of shit  out of the late  Tippi Tom's underwear  dead man shit  you made out  with your chick  after eating shit  yes I did  don't forget  the staples to his head  and he also  brushed his teeth  with dog shit  brushed his teeth  with dog shit  yeah  it's quite an impressive  resume  and you fired him  I know  it's like a retrospective  that they play  at the Oscars  we could just play that  you certainly  have contributed  much to our program  and you're  well missed  what are you doing 
[03:05:30]  these days  well in a cruel  twist of fate  I work for an  organization that  takes care of  adults with  developmental disabilities  Sirius XM  satellite radio  I'll see you in a week  the Rich Vosch Foundation  I'm basically  I'm a maintenance man  oh great  you clean up  the retarded old people  that's terrific  way better than radio  yeah  I really wish  I was still here  it really sucks  oh  what happened  what happened  on the road to  I'm an intern  with the Opie and Anthony show  this is my doorway  to radio 
[03:06:00]  what happened  after you left  that dream  did not come to fruition  well I didn't leave  by choice  wait was he fired  no  I was  the company merged  and I was told  that I've been here  too long  company didn't merge  Sirius bought out  XM in a hostile takeover  leaving all of us  like redheaded stepchildren  that's like saying  Jerry Sandusky  and that boy merged  and us from XM  feel like that  ten year old boy 
[03:06:30]  yes lucky  so you weren't able  to go to radio stations  and say hey  I interned for the  Opie and Anthony show  I did that  thank you  with that resume  next  I eat shit  I brush my teeth  with shit  I got my face  puked up  it's tough to put  that on a resume  yeah that's a good resume  yeah  no I did do that  and I did one air shift  at a different station  oh so  they never paid me for it  so I'm used to that  and just never got called back 
[03:07:00]  station  New Jersey 101.5  oh  the chime time  yeah  bing  fucking awful station  sounds terrible  well it wasn't  it wasn't really helpful  when I told the program director  that I think it's bullshit  that they have to do  traffic and weather  every ten minutes  man  you are against the man  no  right on my resume  it says I want to be  a freeform radio jock  and he's like  that doesn't exist anymore  I'm like alright fine  why didn't you just  kiss some ass  and go freeform  fuck that  I'll get minimum wage  just give me a fucking

[03:23:00]  I gave my  Uncle Nino  thank you for doing  the show today  it's my pleasure  thank you for being  our Santa Claus  I feel like a  I had those gloves on  I feel like a  fucking proctologist  that's right  at least you didn't  have to shove  any fingers up  any assholes  that's not your thing  I don't get no  second opinions  I know what you're  saying  I went to a proctologist  once  tell me about it  he tells me  bend over  I feel something  going in my ass  I turn  and I look back  he's got both of his  hands up in the air  what the hell's he doing  with his proctologist  what the fuck  thank you  love you guys  thank you for stopping by 
[03:23:30]  Uncle Nino everybody  let's give a big hand  to Uncle Nino  who had a good time  what's your name  I didn't hear  you want to talk to me  I'm on the air  why would you  talk to me here  this is what we do here  on After Opie and Anthony Live  Bobo wants to know  if he can put his clothes on  Bobo where's the man  the star  of today's  Thanksgiving skit  Bobo  I'll come to you  how about that  let's go into the audience  for After Opie and Anthony Live  we're here at the Hard Rock  a wonderful group of people  came here today 
[03:24:00]  if you missed it  you gotta check out  I mean everything  was outstanding  there was puke  there was eating of the puke  and then puking of the eaten puke  the first Thanksgiving skit  turned out to be a big success  but Bobo  it didn't seem like  you were quite off book  that was  it was a little bit  there was some stuff  that they must have given me  the wrong script  you think that was the problem  operator error  yeah I think it was  it's just they gave me the script  so last minute  who handled your wardrobe here  I don't know 
[03:24:30]  the staff did  I think everybody  thought of this idea  and I have to ask  because everybody  on the Thanksgiving skit  who played Native Americans  will say  there was Voss  he was in his street clothes  with a headdress on  and there was Chip Chipperson  he had a Cleveland Indians  t-shirt on  and a headdress on  and then we were left  with Bobo  who's just wearing  a loincloth  and body paint  Bobo  I don't know why  I guess they felt  it was funny  to make me do this  and you can't  I don't know  obviously you can't  see it at home yet 
[03:25:00]  the web team was here  videoing from every angle  so there will be  wonderful video footage  but Bobo's body paint  is reminiscent of Kamala  oh yeah  I'm not talking Bobo  why don't you go ahead  it's the after show  with Bobo right  it's Sam Roberts  that's the host  that's me  thank you very much  Bobo has Kamala  body paint on  somebody painted  a beautiful moon  on his belly  and two white stars  on those big old titties  of his  don't tense up  everybody sees  that they're titties  Troy just went 
[03:25:30]  and pinched his nipple  you didn't like that Bobo  how does it feel  what's his stance  yeah Bobo  it seems like  you're backing that ass  up into Troy  no I'm kind of nervous  about this  it's cold in this outfit  you are  it's cold in this outfit  alright  how do you feel  to be back on the show  I mean you were worried  about being banned  I mean it's great  it's great to be here today  does everybody think  that Bobo should keep  doing the Opie and Anthony show  oh wow  so you think  he should be banned  yes  Jesus Bobo  I mean we were going  to bring you back 
[03:26:00]  next week  but should he be banned  no come on  come on  Bobo  I mean  the key to  the key to doing  a radio show like this  is to listen to your fans  and I feel like  I mean the audience  has spoken  one more time  should Bobo  please  should Bobo  should Bobo stay  come on  no you're getting booze  let's see  I'm tired that he  alright  we're going to leave it  there's one  there's one man up there  I'm tired that he's flip flopper 
[03:26:30]  they're not flip flopper  they're on my side  they've always hated you  you're flip flop  you're flip floppers  they're not flip floppers  they've hated you  from day one Bobo  they can't  they're not flip flopping  they're always against  now Bobo  but the people  that are before me  never show up  because there isn't anyone  there are  and they never show up  have the guts  and show up  for what's that  Mr. Malunigan's  is a dog  and doesn't get a vote  now you see Pat Duffy  up there  he was the star  of the show today  he used to intern  he went on  without us asking him  and he drank 
[03:27:00]  potato vomit  and then he vomited  the potato vomit  and then he spit it  onto the audience  it really was  like one of the guys  said I think it was  Opie I don't know  who it was  like a Gigi Allen show  we'll leave it  the final verdict  we're gonna go  thumbs up  means Bobo  he's invited back  anytime he wants  thumbs down  Bobo is once again  banned from the show  Pat Duffy  gives him a thumbs  down  a fierce thumbs down  fuck you  all you haters  supporters  stop hiding  Bobo  supporters 
[03:27:30]  stop lying  you support me  on Twitter  I ain't twittering  until  alright Bobo  why don't you  go change your  clothes  and then we'll  probably call you  in like three days  or something  we always do  but thank you  for acting  upset again  yeah I do  for having to  wear this  humiliating outfit  just go change  what do you mean  wearing this  humiliating outfit  you got to be  on the show  you're flip flopping  Bobo  thank you for  stopping by though  Bobo  it is a joyous  day here  Troy  how did you feel 
[03:28:00]  the skit went  because there was  a lot of  that was kind of  the marquee bit  we were counting on  until Pat Duffy  came and stole the  show like he  tends to do  yeah well the  highlight for me  was Eric sitting  on the big table  what was so great  about Eric sitting  on the table  was all of you  in the audience  sitting there  going oh no  because you  everybody  who was here  at the hard rock  thought that the  table was going  to snap in half  yeah  the stress cracks  in the table  but let's give it  up for the sex bagel  who didn't break  the table  let's give it up 
[03:28:30]  huh  there he is  Eric  let's go talk  to Eric  Eric  you weren't happy  when you saw  the script  but you performed  your ass off  yes I always bring it  you do  how do you feel  today  especially  last time  we were at  the hard rock  you were the  star of the show  you know what I mean  you killed it  with the staff  stand up comedy  today was your  follow up  in the staff  skit  the first  Thanksgiving play  and it was  it was your time  to shine  how do you feel  it went  I thought it 
[03:29:00]  went great  I'm happy  that I wasn't  the worst actor  on that stage  who do you feel  was the worst actor  um  Rich Voss  Rich Voss  was the worst actor  yes from a  Brockish tale  and he's supposed to be  like a trained talent  in that art  yeah  somebody who was  actually in show  business  was indeed  did everybody  enjoy E-Rock's  performance  in the skit  this is what I  try to tell you  E-Rock  you gotta let us  insult you  cause then they  hate us  and they like you  see I don't  follow that logic  but whatever  you know  okay  well  E-Rock 
[03:29:30]  you performed  your ass off  is there any  Pat Duffy's here  yes I saw Pat  and his dad  is here as well  and enjoy the  new radio  Pat Duffy  let's go talk  to Pat Duffy  for a second  it's been a long  time since he  was on the show  the line is now  moving  Opie and Anthony  are in the back  we'll probably  go talk to them  interrupt this  autograph line  plus I want to  see everybody  signing this picture  uh  thanks man  Pat Duffy  you're back  how long has it  been since you  were on the show  I'd say about  three years  it's been a long  time  too long  indeed  um  how do you feel  about your legacy 
[03:30:00]  you know what I mean  like Anthony  when you were upstage  Anthony was going  down your list  of accomplishments  including uh  smearing shit  tasting shit  brushing with shit  and eating vomit  eating vomit  vomit was there too  propelling vomit  um  I'd say it's  it's a long list  of great accomplishments  I would too  because  I mean  even though you've  been gone for  three years  and you were  with the show  for a year and a half  I was with the show  for three years  three years  well two years  two years  okay so call it  two years  so that's five years 
[03:30:30]  total since you did  the baby bird  right  it was 2006  December 06  December of 2006  that was when  Pat from Munaki  uh regurgitated  literally gallons  yeah  of eggnog  into Pat Duffy's face  and fed him  the way a mother bird  does to a baby  Joe Rogan named it  what'd you say  Joe Rogan named that  yes  Joe Rogan named  a bit himself  and to this day  I find it hard  to believe  that there's  ever been a bit  to top that  no I would say  there wasn't  other than one  of my other bits  right  it's hard  they're like your  children  you can't pick a 
[03:31:00]  favorite  yes  um  and how do you  feel  do you listen  to the show  oh yeah  yeah  how do you feel  when uh  you hear someone  like intern Matt  who just comes on  I'm sure you  you were here  for two years  you obviously  didn't waste  your opportunity  you did the stunts  but you also  did the intern stuff  can you hear  intern Matt  wasting his  opportunity  absolutely  you can  you know  every mistake  he's making  every single one  I know  you just simply  can't mouth off  the way that he does  no fucking way  you were one  who had a short fuse  there were many times  where you wanted 
[03:31:30]  to decapitate me  for instance  still do  I would assume so  when you hear Matt  does he enter into  that camp  I would think so  absolutely  and I noticed  that you took pride  actually loogieing  onto the stage  I did  because you knew  Matt would have  to clean it up  absolutely  I knew that's what  I specifically  avoided the bucket  just so that kid  would get on his knees  and clean up my vomit  well there were a lot  of potatoes on the stage  didn't you say something  to him  didn't you say  clean it up bitch  I said clean it up bitch  and guess what  Pat Duffy 
[03:32:00]  he did  he did  and he will again  yes he will  congratulations on  stealing the show  and on your new  XM radio  thank you sir  yes Eric  yeah sure  what's going on Eric  I got a surprise for you  I love surprises  and it's not just  a surprise for me  it's a surprise  for everyone  who's still here  for the after show  which is about  one quarter of the crowd  that was here  for Opie and Anthony  in four minutes  no it looks about right  I cleared out 75%  of the room  now  everybody knows  Sam's works really hard  a lot of people  like him on the air 
[03:32:30]  a lot don't  but both those items  are debatable  he doesn't get paid  much with this company  that is not debatable  so I figured  after all your hard work  especially today  with the play  and everything else  that you deserved  a little present  something for you  to be thankful for  for Thanksgiving  I don't like  this can't be good  it's good  now what I originally  wanted to get you  was intern David  oh my god  why wouldn't you  why would you tell me that  there's nothing  he ran away  he was here  no I went and found him  and he ran away 
[03:33:00]  okay  even  because Iraq is like  the peaceful staff member  that you wouldn't  run away from  even the sex man  yeah  now turn this way  I have your gift  coming for you  I don't think I trust  this is the second best  thing I could get  not even the next best  the second best  isn't the second best  the next best  Sam  I'm scared  say hello  to your other  favorite intern  intern Ricky  hello Ricky  how you doing  I guess you could clap  but Ricky was an intern  before I was even  an intern  I've never met Ricky 
[03:33:30]  before  yeah it's nice to meet you  though  for those who don't know  Ricky  which is the entire audience  no  basically yeah  Ricky was the intern  who continuously got lost  every time we sent him out  to do something  well do we have  I remember this  for those of you  that were fans  as Bobo would like to say  for those of you  who have lingered longer  lingered longer  Ricky was probably  the most famous  of all intern games  where he was sent out  over and over  and over again  because he just  couldn't get an order right  here comes Travis  this is the guy 
[03:34:00]  I was looking for  because Travis  who is now  a higher up  as far as producers  go on the show  I don't know  what your official title is  so I won't even try  I don't think you do  at this point  but he's worked his way  to the top  of the Opie and Anthony ladder  you interned  at the same time  as Ricky  correct  exact same time  and Travis  you've always said  that Ricky  was a valuable asset  to your internship  Ricky's the reason  I have this job  he made me look amazing  all I did  all I did  was I did my job  yeah  I didn't mess up  food orders  you were adequate 
[03:34:30]  yeah  and next to Ricky  you looked like an all star  I was the best  well after experiencing  Ricky and intern Matt  who's over there  just  you see Pat  watching the fucking show  just watch the show Matt  don't do what you have to do  isn't there shit to get  don't you have  what the fuck  do you want me to do  do your fucking job  I am doing my fucking job  do your fucking job  why don't you go have  someone puke in your mouth again  okay then everyone  will know who I am  and remember me  go fuck yourself  wow yeah  Noah that's why  you don't have  like you do  like you do  I do right now  yeah  really are you getting paid 
[03:35:00]  it doesn't fucking matter  who's working with  Opie and Anthony right now  Pat Duffy or Matt  I will say to Pat's  to Pat's credit  he did  while he's not currently  working for Opie and Anthony  he did work for them  for two years  and he's beloved enough  to be welcomed back  whereas Matt  I would imagine  once the semester's over  and I did more  than you did today  what's that  I did more than you today  what did you do  wow you ate another man's puke  wow  remember that mess  that you cleaned up 
[03:35:30]  that was Pat  I did my fucking job  yeah barely  I saw that shit  fuck you  fuck you  well listen  the thing is  Matt is here  fucking Irish prick  Matt likes to hang around  where the mics are  because he figures  one will go in his direction  who do you think  I'm not even giving him the mic  he's done  who do you  who do you think  Travis  is a worse intern  intern Ricky  who's  I mean  he's historically bad  like Ricky 
[03:36:00]  you don't mind me saying that  right  oh no not at all  like you're known  your whole fame  you're the first  terrible intern  of the satellite radio years  correct  correct  is that a badge  that you hold honorably  not really  no it's not complimentary  what are you doing  with your life now  right now I'm working  trying to get by  you know  where do you work  or what do you do  you don't have to tell me  the exact  I don't have to tell you  but I do work in a restaurant  so  you work in a restaurant  you couldn't get  Opie and Anthony's food orders right  now you work in a restaurant  there's only three of them  people who work in restaurants 
[03:36:30]  are responsible for many food orders  on a daily basis  yeah the times change  you know  you did  you've improved your food order techniques  of course  of course  good to know  Travis  so who's worse  who's worse  Matt the intern  or Ricky the intern  if we're going to go on  just competence  competence  I'm going to have to go with Matt  Matt's never got an order wrong  for me  or for anybody else  so Matt's better  in that respect  I hate sticking up for Matt  right  I'm not odor  odor  this is great  odor  odor  who has a better odor  Ricky  Ricky's a much better odor 
[03:37:00]  okay so we're at one and one  now  tiebreaker  yeah tiebreaker  who is better  Pat Duffy or Matt  if you pick Pat Duffy  Pat Duffy  Ricky gets the point  so that's two for Ricky  Ricky wins  congratulations  Ricky  alright we're here on  after Opie and Anthony live  let's go upstairs  let's see  let's see what Opie and Anthony  are up to  hopefully the wireless  will stretch  are you excited to meet them  of course  what's your name  Andrew  Andrew have you met  Opie and Anthony before  yes at the last  at the July show

[03:39:00]  Bob was wishing for that much hair  by the way  that's why he was crying  how do you guys  think the skit went  it was amazing  skit  that was a production  that wasn't a skit  you're downplaying  the importance of  the acting  and writing  and everything that went  behind that  Voss was terrific  I thought  yeah Voss really is good  to just barrel through  with no emotion  he was amazing  he was literally  reading it  like he was reading 
[03:39:30]  the newspaper  yeah  a comic book  yeah a comic book  Sam is reaching for the mic  he doesn't like it  oh I know  hey  oh mommy doesn't want us  to have the mic  sorry Jimmy Norton doesn't deserve  to have a microphone  on the shit show  sorry  go ahead Sam  right back to your magic  I wanted to let you guys  take the picture  everybody's been waiting  all this time  look at this gentleman  with a live from the compound  shirt on  how about this guy  Sam by the way  hold on  hold on  the hottest girl  in attendance  we didn't notice  because you had a  fucking interview  where the hell were you  where were you hiding

[03:42:30]  so many times  in that British accent  did you get to read  the script  before performing  no I just  like to improvise  well you didn't  no you didn't  improvise  it was actually  written down  on the page  but you did  well though  you did very well  I put some  feeling into it  you did  you put some  feeling into it  did you feel  like it was  coming from  a natural place  you talking  about getting  fucked by  the animals  of the forest  well it's not  my usual  way of speaking  but you found  that place  in the back  of your head  that you've been 
[03:43:00]  you know  holding back  for so long  and it was  just so natural  well thank you  stalker patty  so much  for being here  everybody's  getting a picture  signed  everybody's so  excited  I'm gonna  Troy  let's see what's  going on backstage  we can go anywhere  with these mics  so now we're  back on stage  except since  we went back  everybody thought  we weren't coming  back on stage  so there's maybe  six people in the  audience  before there were  at least 13  so it's not  it's not as weak  as it looks  I don't know  if these will  work backstage  but we're gonna 
[03:43:30]  go back  into the locker  room  for a live  after Opie  and Anthony  live from the  hard rock  we're on the  air everybody  so don't say  anything you  wouldn't want  being made  public  a little  static  there's Bobo  Bobo you took  a shower  yeah  yeah I think  yeah I know  I just tried  to  that's getting  a little  staticky  we gotta  that's not  gonna work  Bobo I'm  sorry  hey Sally  intern  how come  so we heard  Matt the  intern today  actually at the  top of the  show before we  went to the  hard rock  Opie was  talking about 
[03:44:00]  we're backstage  now here at  the hard rock  Opie was  talking about  all the  different interns  and how  with the people  on wall street  there's like  the generational  difference  between  you know the  older generation  and the current  generation  is that there's  a few people  who work hard  and have a good  work ethic  and then a lot  more who don't  feel like working  and just feel  entitled  and he specifically  said that that  is made nowhere  more clear than  when he looks at  intern Matt  who's just  standing there with  that shit  eating grin  still on his  face  creepy grin 
[03:44:30]  and you  intern Sal  what did you  Matt did a  good job today  he's cleaning  the puke  off the stage  he's running  around  what about you  what did you  do today  as an intern  for the  Opie Anthony  show  did some photos  stuff like that  some running  around  some normal  stuff  the best part  was that  Travis came to  me  he said  go get some  paper towels  and tell Matt  to go clean up  the puke  so I didn't  have to do  that  which I was  really happy  about  oh but you  actually got  the paper towels  so Matt  could clean up  the puke  actually he  got them  immediately  because he  was actually 
[03:45:00]  excited to  go  oh because  he wanted  to be out  on stage  exactly  did you notice  how long  it took him  to clean up  the puke  he was just  staring right  into Nino's  ass  he loved  that limelight  just fucking  staring right  into it  alright well  Sal you did  a good job  today  Matt the  puke's  clean off  the stage  thank you  I think I  did a very  good job  cleaning up  I mean  there isn't  an ounce  of potatoes  left on  the stages  so what  else can I  do  right  there's  nothing I  can complain  about  so intern  of the day  no no no  that would  be Sal  let's go  back on  stage  we're leaving  the backstage  area now  as they're 
[03:45:30]  cleaning up  here at  the Hard Rock  this is such  a great  experience  not just  for me  but for  you the  listener  I feel  envious  that I  don't get  to listen  to this  at home  because  you don't  get the  behind the  scenes  access  that this  show  gives you  Gary  you don't  have to  talk on  the air  because  you're  my boss  but did  you ever  buy those  two beers  I never  did  no  I got  away  a member  of management  that Opie  usually speaks  about so  fondly  see what's  going on  here  Sal  is so  focused

[03:52:00]  I'm sure it'll be  a great show  if you're a wrestling fan  uh  yep  check it out  what's going on there  is that the puke bucket  yeah I'm trying to  give it to Sal  he's running away  are we really  is that what  is that what we're doing  stupid  this is fucking stupid  Matt you're chasing  Sal around with the  puke bucket  yeah I'm trying to  give it to him  I mean he's supposed  to be working  but he's not working  so I'm trying to  give him something to do  by work  by work  I mean uh  taking the puke bucket  and what do you want  him to do with it  uh I want him to uh  do something with it  where's Erock  isn't the sex man 
[03:52:30]  supposed to be  the intern boss  you got your interns  you got Matt the intern  over here  chasing around  Sal the intern  with the puke bucket  what happened Eric  it's gone to chaos  where's  go flip it in his face  no Eric  that's the worst advice  I've ever heard in my life  I'm backing away  I hope  now they're chasing  around each other  what the hell  is going on here  dude I swear to God  if either of you two  pour that puke bucket  Matt looks evil  there is evil in his eye  right now  he's mad  because Pat Duffy  kind of bitched him up  a little bit  so he's angry about that 
[03:53:00]  right now  you don't like being humiliated  no  not at all  I don't feel I was humiliated  but uh  Eric Eric  you gotta control the chaos  I'm trying to do my  fucking job  and I have to worry  about what you're doing  chasing people  with a puke bucket  hand the mic over to  you don't have to hand it to me  oh by your fucking job  you mean having  Sal the intern  put puke in my face  whoa  after the fact  yes  in fact  I'm tempted to do it  if I was allowed to  go for it  whoa  that was fighting  don't actually do it Eric 
[03:53:30]  do not do it  Eric's got that look  in his eyes  like look  it's for the air  I'm ready to go baby  I'll do the cinnamon challenge  I'll throw puke  in an intern's face  I'm telling you Eric  if you pour that puke  in his face  yeah  they'll fire you  huh  they'll fire you  he'll fire me  no no no  Gary  on stage  he'll fire you  what if I flip it in Gary's face  can I do that  is that good  Eric  somebody is confident today  somebody is confident  you had a good appearance  I guess so  it's for the show  for the show  it's just for the air right  a couple weeks ago 
[03:54:00]  he didn't have his good appearance  I'm surprised he's confident already  no more sick days right  don't care  don't care  good  I'm sure they're not listening  let's talk to  Matt  what are you going to do  with the puke bucket for real  I really don't know  I was just  the guys on stage  were like really  the fucking puke's still on the stage  so I thought I'd take it  I guess you just gotta  I don't know  I mean I think I might  try to find Sal  I'm not sure where he went  where'd he go  why don't you go try to find Sal  and I'm going to ignore you  for a while  you sir  what's your name again 
[03:54:30]  Jason  Jason from Jersey  that's correct  you won the contest  the mashed potato contest  people thought  you thought you'd lost  I did  but I weighed them fair and square  and you won  I think the trick was  I started out with the big spoon early  yeah  and the guy next to me  was doing the little spoon  didn't work out  doesn't count  because your stomach's going to fill up regardless  so you might as well  heat those scoops in  before your stomach catches up  with your brain  and he drank the entire pitcher of water  before I finished the water  and that bloated his stomach  stupid  why do you fill up your belly with water  in a contest like this 
[03:55:00]  but I just want to thank  Pat from Unaki  for not coming today  yeah  Pat from Unaki  just got you 500 bucks  and Big A  for not coming today as well  now  did you have  a strategy going in  because  you  you were the underdog  because Bob Kelly said  at the beginning of the  hard rock portion of today's show  Bob Kelly said  fat guys don't win eating contests  right  and you my friend  you're a fat guy  yes  fat and proud  am I right  fat and proud  good for you  $500 richer  good for you  yeah  fat guy  fat pockets  am I right  that's correct 
[03:55:30]  you walked up there  and said  you know what  today is the day  of the fat guy  today is the day  the fat guy  goes home  with the trophy  and you did  how do you feel  I feel fantastic  were you nervous  did you  did Bob Kelly's  fat guys never win  did that get into your head  no  but the guy  puking up  gingivitis blood  into his potatoes  almost made me  there was gingivitis blood  god  there was a lot  of gingivitis blood  in that bucket  tell me this  was this the same  vomit that Pat Duffy ate  the exact same  vomit  oh no  can it hurt you 
[03:56:00]  to drink  gingivitis blood  probably  oh that's awful  well congratulations  and I'm glad  you didn't have  to drink it  thank you  Pat Duffy's  probably up there  talking to  Opie and Anthony  right now  I don't know  if he'll  get a job  or not  but  Troy he took  a shot at you  that's fine  I have a job  he doesn't  okay well I guess  that is the ultimate  sort of  I win you lose  that's right  but how would you  feel if they  fired you  and replaced you  with Pat Duffy  I mean that's great  let him go ahead  you'd be cool with it  you got your DJ gigs  what else do you need
