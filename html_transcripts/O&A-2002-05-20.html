<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the delayed release of their comedy CD, "Cringe," a 52-track collection featuring uncensored and controversial content.  They expressed frustration with their record company's legal and managerial hurdles, even considering self-releasing it online if the company didn't approve its release soon. They also lamented the potentially outdated and embarrassing cover art.  The show then shifted to a bizarre phone call with Lynn from Massachusetts, who delivered a rambling, sexually suggestive, and nonsensical conversation involving alleged relationships with Opie’s son, Joey,  pregnancy claims, requests for money, and demands for her dog's inclusion in her living arrangements.

MTV's reporting on their role in the early release of Eminem's "The Eminem Show" was criticized for only crediting the radio station and not the hosts themselves.  A listener’s earlier call claiming to have murdered two people was strangely juxtaposed with a discussion about a separate incident involving the delayed delivery of Anthony's TV.  The hosts also discussed losing their Seattle radio slot to classic country music, viewing this as a potential opportunity to secure a new FM station in the city.  A call from James in New Jersey provided a nonsensical answer regarding the location of a butt plug.  Steve-O was announced as a scheduled guest, along with an advertisement for open tryouts for cheerleaders in their upcoming celebrity softball game.

A combative phone call with Garrison followed, who repeatedly insulted the show and claimed Opie and Anthony would never match the success of Don and Mike.  This led to a heated exchange filled with insults and personal attacks, culminating in Opie and Anthony wishing ill on Garrison's mother.  After this, Steve-O and a man who served ten years for manslaughter entered the studio.  The latter detailed his arrest involving angel dust and a crowbar, providing a somewhat unclear and potentially embellished account of his crime and incarceration.

The conversation then turned to Steve-O and his topless girlfriend, Dee.  They engaged in increasingly bizarre stunts, including Dee rolling an eight-ball down her cleavage onto Steve-O's head, resulting in visible injury.  The discussion involved Dee's sexual preferences, Steve-O's views on circumcision, and the playing of a song about keeping someone's feces in a jar.  More discussion of Steve-O's videos and future on-air stunts concluded this segment.

A six-foot-tall blonde woman, Danielle, auditioning to be a bikini girl for the softball game, became the focus, initially involving plans for her to participate in an eight-ball stunt with Steve-O. Dee, already in the studio, expressed strong displeasure with Danielle, engaging in heated arguments about Danielle’s perceived attractiveness and unfair advantage.  Steve-O proposed more outrageous stunts, including a roller chair derby and launching himself down stairs.  Danielle’s multiple attempts at the eight-ball trick were interrupted by Dee's outbursts.  Danielle's father even arrived in the studio.  The conversation remained vulgar and sexually suggestive, with Dee revealing a past incident involving a knife and threatening Steve-O. Dee's escalating behavior, including throwing objects and yelling, led to her removal from the studio. The segment ended with Steve-O performing a beer bong through his nose and unresolved tension between Dee and the others.  Numerous phone calls focused on Dee’s behavior.

The final segment featured a video of Steve-O performing a beer chug through his anus, which was discussed in detail, along with the video and audio quality, drawing comparisons to "German porno."  The conversation included Steve-O’s upcoming Jackass movie, censorship issues, and the availability of uncensored content. Listener calls commented on the butt chug and the day's events, often using vulgar and crude language. Discussions with other female guests regarding their suitability for the softball game continued. The show concluded with the hosts and Steve-O announcing their plans to visit Hooters.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I haven't heard that in a while.  I haven't heard that in a long time, Anthony.  That's an O&A classic.  Ah, the butt plug.  From a little CD called Demanded World.  Yes.  We're working on the next one.  Demanded World that you can get.  Oh, that's right, you can't.  Because the record company that put it out is a bunch of tools.  But we're working on a follow-up called Cringe.  Right.  It's pretty much done and ready to go.  So, we're just waiting for the lawyers and management of this fine radio company to give us the okay. 
[00:00:30]  We want to put it out our way.  Right.  And until they agree to our demands, it's just sitting in a safe.  Yes.  Waiting to see the light of day.  The delay between Demanded World and Cringe longer than the delay between Boston's first album and second album.  Right?  I think it is longer.  Horrible.  We've been waiting longer than Guns N' Roses fans. 
[00:01:00]  Guns N' Roses fans have to sit and wait for the album.  Us longer.  A lot of controversy over our next CD.  Yes.  Yes, indeed.  52 tracks all mastered and ready to go.  52.  We've got the cover art chock full of entertainment.  The cover art very embarrassing.  We might have to redo the cover art because I think we took that picture 10 years ago.  It was.  It was many, many years ago.  We have a great concept for the cover.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  It's been used elsewhere, the cover shot. 
[00:01:30]  It's on the internet.  It's been on a couple of covers of magazines.  Magazines, right.  They've used it.  But it's never been on the cover of our cringe CD.  So, a little message to the radio company.  If you guys want to make an S-load of money.  Yeah.  Give us the okay and we can release this thing finally.  That's how we have to present things to the company.  Guaranteed to sell a half million copies.  You'll make money.  Guaranteed we'll sell a half million copies. 
[00:02:00]  Wouldn't it suck if, like, another radio station played the whole thing before we released it?  People bootlegged it?  How pissed would you be?  I wouldn't be pissed at all.  I'm ready to just throw it on the internet.  I know.  Enough already.  I'm so ready.  We're holding out hope.  Yeah.  We should set a time limit.  Yeah.  And if it's not out by, like, I don't know, October 1st.  Oh, then we're just putting it out.  We just throw it on the internet.  That'll get the company going because they've got to make money on it and they won't make money if it's on the internet. 
[00:02:30]  Good.  If they have a chance to make money off us, of course.  Right.  They'll figure it out.  Look at Mark from Newark.  Is this best of?  Didn't you finish cringe like two years ago?  Yes, Mark.  That's the point.  And no, this is not the best of.  Two and a half years it's been kind of sitting in a vault.  Yeah.  Every once in a while we get copies leaked to us.  I mean, tracks leaked to us.  Our own tracks get leaked to us.  Well, that's when we can figure out where it is.  Right.  Because they don't even want this stuff on the radio for whatever reason. 
[00:03:00]  It's gotten really ridiculous.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  We'll figure it out and get it out there.  The lawyers got all confused.  They were convinced that a lot of this material that's on the cringe CD aired in that form on our show.  Yeah, so that caused a whole legal problem.  They're like, well, we can't put a CD out.  That has recordings of stuff you've done on the air.  Because then if somebody has a problem with it, they could just play the CD for officials.  Like, no, it didn't air like this.  We put the appropriate bleeps in on the air.  But now we want to give people the unedited, you know, with all the S's and F's. 
[00:03:30]  They're convinced we put the C song.  Right.  Unedited.  Unedited on the air.  Yeah, because you could just say the C word.  We lost that battle so bad.  They were convinced we put the F lesson on the air without the bleeps.  Yeah.  Well, we had a song about the old mayor here, the Rudy rap, where Mother Effer was through the whole song.  They were convinced that we put it on the air that way.  That way, with actual Mother Effer being broadcast. 
[00:04:00]  And no one will listen to us.  I'm like, of course it didn't air like this.  That's what makes this CD so special.  Opie, who was fighting our battles back then?  That's probably why no one listened.  The ice cream program director.  Oh, the ice cream man?  Yeah, he was doing it.  All right.  So that's probably why no one listened, because no one listened to him.  Well, eventually.  If they want to make a lot of money, then give us the okay.  Money speaks with these people.  Exactly.  It's going to sell a half a million copies guaranteed.  Hell yeah.  All over the country. 
[00:04:30]  Guaranteed.  One of these days.  One of these days is right.  All right, let's go to Howie.  Howie!  Why wouldn't they say your name on the air on MTV?  Oh.  Oh, that's okay, though.  No, it isn't.  You're syndicated in 18 cities.  Everybody heard Eminem's songs.  Come on.  I'll tell you why.  Because a couple of the jocks worked for the competition here in New York.  Yeah.  So they're able to kind of, you know, pull some strings over there.  Opie, by the way, I want you to know, if you play any tracks off of Cringe, I'll be  sending a cease and desist over across the console. 
[00:05:00]  And believe me, I could deliver it quickly.  Hand it right to you.  Later, boy.  All right.  Yeah, I guess we were all over MTV this weekend, huh?  Yeah.  Well, the story was reported on MTV.com that we broke the Eminem album on Friday.  And it seems that we were directly responsible for them pushing the date back.  That's what they're saying.  Now it's going to be released, what, May 28th?  May 28th.  May 24th.  The Eminem show.  We ended up playing five or six tracks.  At least five.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Five, I think.  I think it was five.  And the album's sounding great.  Pretty good stuff.  It was a real big deal for this radio show.  And then MTV News was all over it.  But they just mentioned the radio station we're on in New York instead of our names.  Yeah, they didn't say the Opie and Anthony show.  It was just WNEW FM New York.  Well, this is how it was reported over the music station.  Check this out.  Hi, I'm Sujan Park with an MTV News Brief.  One of the most anticipated albums of the year, Eminem's The Eminem Show, will now be released May 28th, a week earlier than its original June 4th street date. 
[00:06:00]  Word of the change in the release came late Friday from Eminem's label, Aftermath Interscope Records, who, in an exclusive statement to MTV News, attributed the move to, quote, rampant bootlegging and Internet piracy.  As MTV News previously reported, all 20 tracks from the Eminem Show were first leaked online May 11th and have been available on various file sharing services, as well as from bootleg vendors on the streets of New York for five bucks. 
[00:06:30]  Friday afternoon, New York radio station WNEW FM played several tracks on the air after reading a cease and desist letter from Aftermath Interscope Records.  When the Eminem Show does arrive in stores May 28th, the first two million copies sold will feature a DVD of exclusive Eminem performance and interview footage.  That's news for now.  Stay tuned for more news at 10 to the hour here on...  All right, there you go.  That's how they reported all weekend.  Didn't say us. 
[00:07:00]  By name.  Just the station.  That's all right, though.  I know.  People know who we are.  Of course.  We're the guys that have that nut that claimed he murdered two people on the air.  There's controversy brewing over that.  You know that he called our show before that?  Yeah, I'm hearing something about this.  Rick, do you have a chance to find that clip?  And we blew him off.  Yeah.  That Eddie guy, the nutty guy.  Yeah, I'm still looking for it, but I'm kind of sure about what day that happened.  It was the day I was talking about how those two gorillas messed up my TV. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, your TV when they were delivering it.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, was messed up.  Was it broken?  Was it broken?  It's fuzzy.  Something went wrong.  It's fuzzy.  Maybe I've got to adjust the aerial there, Ralphie.  Well, remember how I said they rolled the TV into my place?  Yeah, yeah.  And then a guy, I guess, called up that was...  Right.  He was trying to tell you that by rolling the TV or whatever he was saying, you guys started  to talk all over him and he got real pissed.  I remember that, yeah.  We laughed at him.  Jim Norton made fun of him and we hung up on him. 
[00:08:00]  That, people are starting to say, was Eddie.  Didn't he say, though, he was in the appliance business?  He said he worked at an appliance store.  All right.  Well, there you go.  He's been trying for a long time to, you know, be a part of our show.  Yeah.  So, we're trying to find that clip.  It could be kind of fun to listen to.  You had to bring the TV back.  Did they have to, like, take it out of the place?  No, they're working on it.  Let's just put it that way.  At your house.  You know what?  You got to call up and go, bring me new TV.  I've had it. 
[00:08:30]  That's pretty much where it's going.  That's what you got to do.  That's pretty much where it's going.  Fuzzy.  Hey, Anthony, Ron from Cleveland.  Eminem just leaked cringe on his website.  That bastard.  You know, I think we should just throw that on the internet.  You want to do that?  That's not a bad idea.  I think we should.  I'm sure...  Screw it.  People would be pretty psyched.  Yeah.  Before we move on to a couple letters we got from fans.  Yeah.  We got to talk to Jim in Seattle because there's big news brewing in Seattle.  Oh, I heard about this, too. 
[00:09:00]  This is very good.  Jim?  Yo.  Why don't you make the official fan announcement?  You guys were replaced by country music.  Not just country music, which is bad enough.  I'm hearing old country music.  Classic country, they call it.  Yep.  70s and 80s.  Classic country from the 70s and 80s.  Classic country of 70s and 80s?  Yeah.  I thought it was like old, old, like 50s.  Your cheating heart will make me a wee. 
[00:09:30]  Your cheating heart.  You're a little a-hee-hoo.  That is awful music.  I hope you guys get picked up, but that's it.  Stand by your man.  Wait, wait, Jim, Jim, Jim.  That's phenomenal, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not like Patsy Cline.  We were on in AM, right?  Yep.  Yeah, you know what?  This is good news for us.  Because now we've got a chance to go on an FM in Seattle and really mess things up.  Well, I hope that happens soon, so.  Quite frankly, we weren't getting many listeners through that AM frequency. 
[00:10:00]  Many?  Did you read the email from the guy?  It said, we registered no listeners.  The station, he was saying, registered, no listeners.  The ratings, when I read the ratings, it reminded me of Animal House, when Dean Wormer was reading it out.  Zero point zero.  You have no ratings.  Awful.  Awful ratings.  So, yeah, it frees us up to go to somewhere else in Seattle.  All right.  Okay.  But Jim was listening.  Yeah, you were listening.  You were listening, right, Jim?  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:10:30]  Well, we're going to have good news.  We're adding another market, I think, Monday.  Wait for today, so.  You know how touchy Seattle fans shoot themselves.  It seems like for every city we lose, we gain like three.  Right.  We lost Austin, but we gained, what, Allentown, Wilkes-Barre, and Harrisburg.  Yeah.  Now we lost Seattle, and there's already one and maybe two new cities.  Picking up the O&A show next Monday.  Yeah, I've been reading that.  Huh?  Oh, in Albany.  Sorry, Albany.  Yes, Albany.  Hello, Albany.  We've never gotten a call from Albany.  I forgot we were on in there. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  Later.  Bye.  Listen to how depressed Jim.  Yeah.  He's depressed enough because he's in Seattle, and then they get this shocking news.  Anthony, I was going through my mail last week.  Yes.  And I got a letter from one of our listeners, and I'm just waiting for a second.  People, you know, they don't know how to do that.  Could you do that?  Rick, help me out.  Thank you.  Why is it taking so long?  Thank you. 
[00:11:30]  God, you've got to pick up the phone.  We're trying to set up something here.  So, I got a letter from one of our listeners in the Massachusetts area, Anthony.  Yes.  And I felt pretty special because she's completely out of her effing mind.  Uh-huh.  But just when you were feeling special, I guess.  I know.  I was bragging about the letter, and I was showing you today, and you got one today from the same lady.  I certainly did.  She writes us separately.  And I feel extra, extra special, Opie, because look what I got with mine.  You got a picture.  I got a photo. 
[00:12:00]  This shit.  Anthony, you want to take a look?  Oh, wow.  Is that before or after she kidnapped James Collins?  Exactly.  That's what we were thinking.  She's a middle-aged woman that looks a lot like, what's her name there?  Just read the letter, Mr. Man.  There's a railroad tie and some sledgehammers in her future.  What date is your letter?  Mine is dated 5-6-0-2.  And you're just getting yours.  Mine was 5-6-0-2 as well.  When did you get yours?  Last week.  Last week?  Well, that's the fine mail delivery system we have here. 
[00:12:30]  Thank God the security's in place where they check all the letters that come in.  They rip them open, then they put a seal on it that says it's been checked.  It actually goes to a different location now.  Does it?  Our mail goes all over the place.  I'm getting stuff that was sent to me three and a half weeks ago now.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is ridiculous.  All right.  Security.  For our safety, though.  To backtrack, Brian, I wait longer for O&A's next CD than I do...  Wait, I'm waiting longer for O&A's next CD than I am for a new Voss joke. 
[00:13:00]  Oh!  God.  Which is true.  Okay, here it is.  I stink.  Here it is, Anthony.  Yes.  Dated 5-6-0-2.  From the lovely Lynn from Massachusetts, okay?  Lynn from Massachusetts.  Well, the letter starts off,  Hi, Daddy.  Now, that might, in some cases, be kind of cool if the girl is maybe a fan.  Maybe she's got a little something for you.  She's going, oh, hi, Daddy.  You know, hi, Daddy.  A little sick, but could be taken in that context. 
[00:13:30]  Forgive me, please, for not writing for many months.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me in my apartment.  Not my son, Joey.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me in my apartment.  I'm assuming, yes, it is your son, Joey.  Is that who she's talking about?  Yes.  I've never met my son, Joey.  Dad, I love Anthony's son, Joey, so much.  Mom mailed me $178 for doing good work at her house. 
[00:14:00]  Dad, I am having my dog, Rock, move in with me.  You have no say in it, Daddy.  Mom told me you wanted my phone number.  I don't know if I want you to have my phone number, period.  Daddy, I have something to say.  Here goes, I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  What?  Let me read that again because that's exactly what she meant.  Here goes, I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  Now, did my son, Joey, get her pregnant, or is she pregnant holding my son, Joey? 
[00:14:30]  The Joey that she talks about that's already living is the same Joey that she's saying.  She might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  Get it?  Has she been having sex with my son, Joey, or is she pregnant with my son, Joey?  Joey's alive already.  Okay.  But now she's talking like Joey's not alive yet.  Right.  Okay.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey. 
[00:15:00]  And I don't think so, but don't tell Grammy White, okay?  Daddy, tell Mom to get out of my apartment.  I'm not in bed with Anthony's son, Joey.  Oh, see?  Maybe she's having sex with Joey.  Ma is a liar.  I have to stop now.  Love, Lynn.  So I was bragging, like, look at what I got today.  And Anthony got a letter from the same lady today.  Fan mail from some flounder.  Ha ha.  Yeah, I got the same one. 
[00:15:30]  Dear Anthony,  I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top.  Now,  I don't have any daughters.  Wait, wait.  If she's calling you Daddy,  Right.  Apparently she believes she's your daughter and she's pregnant with Joey.  So,  Wait, she's my daughter, so I'm Daddy?  Yeah.  But then who are you?  I'm,  Wait, does she start your letter off?  Hi, Daddy.  You're my father-in-law. 
[00:16:00]  How does your letter start?  Dear Anthony,  I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant,  He will blow his top.  She's your daughter.  I'm Daddy.  She's my daughter.  And you're dodging her.  Wait, all right.  So wait, Daddy,  I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me.  So how are you related to this?  This is like a goddamn David Lynch movie.  It makes no sense.  I think she's married to you, Anthony.  She's married to me?  She's married to you. 
[00:16:30]  You had the son, Joey, that she wants to,  I don't know.  Well, let me finish mine,  and perhaps it'll open up a whole world of enlightenment.  Maybe the listeners can help us.  All right, start off.  Dear Anthony,  I'm getting scared.  If Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant,  he will blow his top.  I'm going for an upper GI Thursday.  Anthony,  I love your son, Joey, so much.  He is my angel.  Opie has no say in the matter.  I will give your son, Joey, 
[00:17:00]  the special love he wants.  Anthony,  I might be having my Dalmatian Rocky move in with me.  I am very lonesome with my dog.  I want to ask my daddy if he could lend me 15 bucks.  Is Opie your daddy?  Is that what she says?  She wants 15 bucks from you, Opie?  I used the $175 you gave me, Anthony.  I'm afraid of my daddy.  Can you write to me?  I am very, very sorry for not writing to you and my daddy. 
[00:17:30]  I feel bad.  I will write to you and dad often as possible.  Take care, love, Lynn.  And according to the photo,  how old would you make her?  At least 50.  She looks like she's...  52.  Is that what you're guessing?  I'll go 52.  52.  I'm thinking because of her appearance,  she might be younger than she looks,  but it's no younger than very late 40s.  Okay.  But, okay, 
[00:18:00]  I'll go with the late 40s,  early 50s.  She is overweight.  She is old and matronly looking.  And she's wearing a house dress  standing in front of a wall.  Big ass house dresses.  And she does look like...  What's her face there from that Stephen King movie?  Wonderful.  She just looks...  I hate crazy people.  I love them, yeah, right? 
[00:18:30]  You don't understand.  I have no tolerance for the mentally challenged.  They really annoy me.  Well, this woman is totally...  She's a nut.  ...out of her bird.  And lo and behold,  we have her on the phone.  Yes, we do.  Maybe now, Opie,  we can get an answer.  Who's daddy?  Where is my son, Joey?  And is he alive?  Is he pregnant?  Who's her father?  Is it you?  Well, Jim has figured out the relationship.  Oh, thank God, Jim.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  Help us out here. 
[00:19:00]  Opie, you're her daddy, right?  I think we got that.  All right.  All right.  Anthony is Joey's daddy,  and she's banging him.  She's banging Joey?  She's banging your son, Joey.  Hmm.  I...  So, Mike is saying on line one,  Ant is his own grandfather.  Well, I got...  I missed the middle of the reading  from the delay,  but I'm pretty sure that's what I got.  Okay.  Anthony, I love your son, Joey, so much.  He is my angel.  It sounds more motherly than... 
[00:19:30]  Opie has no say in the matter.  I will give your son, Joey,  the special love he wants.  See, it's your son.  Oh, so she...  I think Lynn has been cheating on me  with Anthony.  No, no, no.  You're our father.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, wait a minute.  So, my son, Joey...  Exactly.  ...is like...  Is banging Lynn.  Opie's...  Could be Opie's son-in-law  at some point  if they hook up.  There you go.  So, what does that make you two  to each other?  That's what we're trying to figure out.  Well...  I don't know what you...  Well, you're both fathers,  but you're...  All right. 
[00:20:00]  Well, she's on the line.  Let's talk to her.  Oh, let's.  Thank you, Jim.  I can't wait.  All right.  So, here's Lynn.  Oh, my God.  It takes forever  to put my hold.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  Here we go.  Hey, Lynn.  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Great.  You know, we got your letters  and we've been reading them, Lynn.  Mm-hmm.  And they're good letters.  Very good letters.  Good, good, good letters.  You did good writing them, Lynn.  Good letter writing.  Good letter writing.  Now, we just want to know 
[00:20:30]  a couple of things, Lynn.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Who is your daddy?  Anthony.  But, but, see, Lynn?  Mm-hmm.  Opie got the letter  that said, that was addressed to daddy.  Mm-hmm.  So, I thought...  But I made a mistake.  I meant to put to Anthony, you know.  Okay, so I...  Yeah, that was my mistake.  I had just woken up  when I woke up there.  Oh, okay.  That's okay, Lynn.  Everything's good. 
[00:21:00]  Mm-hmm.  Now, I'm your father?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, all right.  How old of a girl are you, Lynn?  How old are you, Lynn?  I'm 41.  You're 41?  Mm-hmm.  And that's your father?  That's good.  I'm her daddy.  You're 68?  I have no idea.  Now, Lynn, who is Opie to you?  He is my boyfriend's dad.  Your boyfriend's dad.  And your boyfriend is...  His name is Joey.  His name is George Glass.  His name is Joey.  Hold on, hold on. 
[00:21:30]  Anthony is...  Yeah.  You're...  I'm Lynn's father, Opie.  So, you're 60.  I'm, I'm Joey's father?  Yes.  Which means you're going out with a kid that's got to be...  How old is...  I...  How old is...  Joey is 37.  Joey's 37.  Opie, you're about 57 years old.  I'm probably going to be 42 years old next month.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  So, I'm about 57, and it's about 60.  Uh-huh.  When did you sleep with a rhinoceros, Anthony?  You got it. 
[00:22:00]  I don't remember that.  Now, Lynn...  Uh-huh?  If, if, um...  Uh-huh.  I...  If I'm your father...  Uh-huh.  Who's your mommy?  My mother's first name is Nancy.  Nancy and I apparently had a relationship with Nancy.  Yes.  And, and we had sex.  I guess.  And you were born.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  I'm also hearing, uh, Lynn, that you have a baby due in August?  Yes.  And, uh, and Anthony's not too happy about it. 
[00:22:30]  You know, and...  Why am I not happy?  I'm ecstatic, Lynn.  Yeah.  Number one.  First of all, I love Joey like he was my own.  Dad.  And, and, you know something?  That you're having Joey's baby, uh, is a very good thing.  Be quiet, Dad.  She wants to talk to her daddy.  Okay.  Talk to daddy, Lynn.  Okay, thanks.  Go ahead, Lynn.  Hi, Dad.  Hi, Lynn.  How have you been?  I miss you.  I know. 
[00:23:00]  I miss you too, Dad.  But, um, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to leave your apartment.  I can't live here with you anymore.  Um, I'm just going to take my dog and Joey and I'm just going to leave.  No, please don't go, Lynn.  I need you around.  I, you're my daughter.  Dad.  Yes.  Number one.  Yes.  I'm 41 years old.  Okay.  Let me leave.  You're still my little girl, Lynn.  You're still my little girl.  Dad, I understand that.  You're daddy's little girl, Lynn.  Why do you upset me like this? 
[00:23:30]  Why?  I'm sorry.  Why do you upset me?  Yeah.  No, you know.  Oh, my God.  You're my little girl.  I'm sorry, Dad.  I'm sorry.  Does the dog talk to you, Lynn?  No, Dad.  No.  Daddy wants to see you naked.  No, Dad.  I don't think so.  I don't think so, Dad.  Daddy's home.  Your daddy's home.  Daddy.  Stay. 
[00:24:00]  Dad, listen to me, okay?  Okay, Lynn.  For an example, when we were at Aunt Mary's yesterday.  I remember.  Yes.  It was yesterday.  Yes.  What happened?  Number one, when I got into your car yesterday.  Yes.  And I had my hair long and curled.  You know that.  It's so cute.  Listen, listen, Daddy, okay?  Yes, okay, daughter.  Number one, Daddy, you turn around and you told me that I look like a witch.  That I had my hair long and I didn't put it up.  No, a good witch.  Daddy.  I meant, Lynn.  Lynn, damn you.  I meant like Sabrina the teenage witch. 
[00:24:30]  Daddy.  She's cute.  Daddy.  I'm sorry, Lynn.  I was drinking.  You embarrassed me yesterday, Daddy.  I was drinking, Lynn.  Like when I had sex with Nancy and had you.  Daddy.  Ah.  Yeah, I just can't live here with you anymore.  Please stay, Lynn.  Daddy never wanted you, Lynn.  Yeah.  You shut up.  I realize that.  Your son Joey is corrupting Lynn.  I realize that.  Is Joey treating you nice, Lynn?  Yes, Daddy.  Number one, we had gone out Saturday. 
[00:25:00]  He took me out to the outback and we had such a good time, you know.  Hey, Lynn, but the baby you're carrying is not Joey's, is it?  Yes, it is, Dad.  No, this is your father.  Yeah, it was.  It is not.  It is not.  It is not Joey's.  The baby you're carrying is Satan's.  Daddy, no.  It's Satan's child.  No, I knew you were.  It's the devil's child, Lynn.  Rick was right. 
[00:25:30]  Rick was right, Daddy.  Rick was right.  What?  What did Rick say?  Rick had told me that, you know, that I could have the baby, you know.  Rick is wrong.  Rick, Rick.  And now Rick must die.  I just shot Rick.  I just shot Rick.  Yeah.  But Rick told me that since I'm 41 years old, I have my life.  I can do what I want, okay?  I'm not your little girl anymore, Daddy.  I'm 41 years old.  I want you to have an abortion.  Okay?  I want you to have an abortion and get rid of Joe's baby. 
[00:26:00]  No, Daddy.  I'm not giving up Opie's baby.  Suck it out with a Hoover vacuum if you have to.  Wait, hold on.  Opie's baby?  Is it Opie's baby?  It's Opie's son's baby.  Opie's son's baby.  Well, my son cannot.  Dad!  Number one.  My son cannot get with you anymore.  What, Lynn?  There's no way in hell I'm giving this baby up.  I'm...  Dad, you have no say in this matter, okay?  I'm going to call the government and they're going to take the baby away.  Daddy, they can't.  The government is going to take it away unless you put tinfoil on your head and keep the  signals from reaching your brain, Lynn. 
[00:26:30]  Put the tinfoil on your head, Lynn.  Quickly.  The government will find you.  Lynn, Lynn, quickly put tinfoil on your head.  Do you have tinfoil there?  No.  Lynn.  Yeah, it's covered.  Lynn, quickly get tinfoil, please.  Can you do this for me?  No.  Lynn, please, my little girl.  Get tinfoil and put it on your head.  What?  To keep the government's signals from reaching your brain.  Dad, come on.  Why?  Do I sound crazy?  Dad, you were drinking again, weren't you?  Yes, I'm drinking.  That's right, Bill.  That's like I was when I touched you, Lynn, when you were...  I hope you remember when I touched you. 
[00:27:00]  I'm so sorry.  Right, Dad.  Right.  Oh, another thing, too, Dad.  Okay?  Oh, another thing.  Dad, listen to this.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  And I'm going to tell Oprah this, and I'm going to make sure he tells you.  All right.  All right.  Number one, Daddy, I had $175, okay, for my payroll check.  And you turned around, and you took $60 off me.  I needed it.  How am I about, Daddy?  I needed it.  How am I, Daddy?  I needed it for gas.  Can you say three rights, make a left, by the way?  What?  Yeah.  Dad, you got two jobs. 
[00:27:30]  Dad, you got two jobs, okay, number one.  Number two, you have two good paychecks, okay, and you took $60 out of my wallet that day.  Dad, and that's all I had to listen to until this week.  You know, Tuttle from New York checked in and said, Opie's son, Joey, his father makes  $130 million, and he only takes you to the Outback.  He is a cheap bastard.  Dad, we had such a good time, okay?  Yes.  Didn't we have fun, my daughter?  Dad.  Yeah.  Daddy, please. 
[00:28:00]  Okay, you don't understand what my point is, okay?  What do you want from me?  What I want is I want you to write me a letter, okay, saying that I want you to write the people  downstairs in the office from upstairs from where you live, explaining to them that I want  my dog to move in with me and you, and I want a letter written.  No pets allowed.  Huh?  Dad.  The dog is evil.  Daddy, no, you don't understand, okay?  The dog is evil.  Dad.  We are bringing the dog to the pound. 
[00:28:30]  No.  The dog is going to the pound.  I want my dog to move in with us.  The dog's going to the dog pound.  I'm coming and picking him up and taking him down to the dog pound where he'll be gassed.  Daddy.  Daddy, please.  I want one.  Shut up and listen to your father.  Please, Daddy.  Can Rocky.  No.  No.  He can't.  No.  No.  Lynn, know why he can't?  Why?  The dog is dead.  Tiffany.  You know, just because you have a real question, but, okay?  Listen to your father.  Don't blame it on me, okay? 
[00:29:00]  Dad, please.  I want Rocky to move in with me, okay?  What?  You want to go to the moon?  What?  I said I want Rocky to move in here.  Hey, what kind of medication do you want?  I want to have my dog in your apartment.  Hey, Lynn.  What?  What kind of medication do you want?  I'm only on breath in for my asthma.  What?  I have asthma, okay?  Yeah.  And I'm on breath in for my asthma.  Nothing for the wacky thoughts in your head?  I don't have wacky thoughts.  I'm not going to word.  Hey, Lynn, we can go down to the free clinic and get one of those abortions. 
[00:29:30]  Dad, please.  Okay, no.  And you're not giving...  No way.  I'm not giving up Joey's baby.  The power of Christ compels you.  Dad, I don't believe in that stuff.  The power of Christ compels you.  Dad, I don't believe in that stuff.  Dad, I don't believe in that stuff.  No, I really don't.  Hey.  Dad.  What?  The only thing I'm asking you to do very nicely is...  No!  If you can write the Burlington Housing Authority a letter... 
[00:30:00]  Nope.  ...thing that you have...  ...that you gave your daughter permission to have my dog moving on me.  The dog is dead.  Dad.  No.  The dog is dead.  No.  Daddy, Grammy is a beautiful dog.  No, no, no, no.  I can't believe for that.  You'll get nothing and like it.  You want me to smack you again?  No.  I'll smack you.  No.  Okay.  I'll smack that smile off your face.  That retarded grin.  Fine, Daddy.  I got your picture right here.  This is your brother.  Kill two Colombians anytime. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  Just checking.  That's a bit.  No.  We will let Rocky move in with you.  As long as you let Daddy come into your room again tonight.  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  No way.  You look awful sexy in this dress.  I'm looking at the picture.  Daddy.  I'll lift that up and put my head under there like a 17th century photographer.  Daddy.  Daddy.  I'm only asking this one favor.  No.  No, no, darling.  I'm going to be asking you.  I want Rocky in here.  No. 
[00:31:00]  Well, then can I get a small dog?  No.  We'll talk about it tonight when I slip into your bed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'll feel my beard and my whiskey breath against the back of your tender neck.  Right, Dad.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to come by tomorrow and punch you in the stomach to get rid of that baby.  Dad, one other thing, too.  Okay.  What?  Dad.  What?  One other thing, too.  What?  You gave me a list.  I thought she was going to click up and go, I got you.  Hang up on us.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You gave me $175. 
[00:31:30]  You gave me $125.  Yes, I did.  Well, you made me a list what to get you for your food.  I went out with my payroll check.  I spent over $186.  So?  Good.  Just because you wanted it, you know?  I'll wait for you.  You know what I need, Lynn?  Yeah.  Lynn, you know what I need?  And I'll let you keep the dog if you do this.  I'll write the letter so you can keep the dog, Lynn.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Go to the supermarket.  Yeah.  All right? 
[00:32:00]  How much money do you have on you right now?  $25.  $25.  I need $25 worth of gum out of the gumball machine.  What?  For what reason?  I just need it.  Make sure you get nickels or whatever you need to do it.  $25 worth of gum.  I'll mail you.  I'll mail you some money.  Would that be okay to get it yourself?  No, you have to get it.  And how am I going to give it to you?  How am I mail it or whatever?  I'm going to come there tonight.  And you better have the gumballs or I'll kill the dog. 
[00:32:30]  Dad, you're not trying to walk you.  You're not going there walking.  I'll kill that dog.  Dad, you're not going there walking.  Dad!  You're not alone.  Hey, Lynn.  No?  Lynn, Lynn.  What?  You are a friggin' lunatic.  You're insane.  Did you know that?  Oh, really?  You're crazy.  Yeah?  I'm not your father.  Opie isn't the father of your boyfriend.  You're a kooky woman that needs medication.  Yeah, right.  Why don't you go to the hospital?  But I am your brother, and I do want you to drink from the dog's mule and then commit suicide. 
[00:33:00]  No way.  You're crazy.  You're a little wacky there, Lynn.  You're crazy.  What do you do for a living, Lynn?  I used to work for Papaginos.  Papaginos.  And then what?  And after that, I got pregnant, and here I am.  What?  What happened?  I left my job and got pregnant.  You got pregnant?  What did they do with the kid?  My dad is in my stomach.  What?  Never mind.  Where's your kid, Lynn? 
[00:33:30]  Dead in her stomach?  Dad.  Dead?  No.  I said daddy.  No.  Daddy's home.  No.  Yeah, think about it.  Okay?  You know?  Lynn, where's your kid?  I'm due in August, daddy.  No, you're not.  I'm due in August.  You're not pregnant.  No one's banging you, Lynn.  No one's had sex with you, so how are you going to have a kid?  I don't think so, daddy.  How are you going to have a kid?  You don't think so, daddy?  Not with my little girl.  Only I get to do that.  Daddy, don't even start.  Okay?  Yes.  I'll start again and again. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, don't start.  The baby's mine, Lynn.  The baby is mine.  It's your father's baby inside you.  No way.  Yes, it is.  I have no dad.  I don't even want to, you know.  Didn't I tell you not to call daddy at work?  Yes, daddy.  Didn't I tell you?  I know that.  I know that.  What's the punishment for that, Lynn?  Dad, I know I don't want to call you at your other job.  What's the punishment, baby?  What's the punishment, baby? 
[00:34:30]  Dad, I know you don't want me calling you at your other job.  Okay?  I understand that.  Yes.  I don't call you at your other job.  You have to suck daddy's mule.  Daddy at work?  Huh?  Or I have to come there and put my mule in your face.  Oh, I doubt it, dad.  I doubt it.  Yes.  Dad, all I need to know is I want to get out of your apartment.  That's all I want to know.  So leave.  I don't want you there.  Thank you.  I don't want you there.  I have your permission to leave, right?  Get out!  I have your permission to leave, right?  Lynn, we've got to let you go. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Go get some medication.  Yep.  Okay.  Go to the hospital.  Mm-hmm.  Right now.  Yeah, right.  See how crazy you are?  Yeah, right.  Okay.  I'm coming home tonight.  I want you out of that place by the time I get home.  Dad, you won't come up yet.  I can't wait to you yet.  Bye.  Bye.  Leave.  Okay, bye, dad.  Leave that house.  Yeah, you don't think you really think.  Leave.  Leave that house.  Pack up and leave right now, because when I get home tonight, I don't want to see you there.  Okay.  Okay?  Yep. 
[00:35:30]  Good.  Leave.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  It's called thinning the herd if she walks out in front of a bus or something.  Ugh.  Ugh.  I hate crazy people.  What a lunatic.  First, her whole letter is backwards, because then it turns out that I'm a daddy, and Opie  is the father of the kid that she's going out with.  Right.  And the kid is 37 years old.  Yeah.  You know what's annoying?  If she was hot, you know how easy she'd be to bang? 
[00:36:00]  That's the thing.  I know.  Why can't hot chicks be this crazy?  Why do crazy people have to love eating so much?  Oh.  Because if she was hot, that call would have went completely different.  Yeah.  Why don't you take your panties off right now?  Get on a train.  Get off in Penn Station.  Get completely naked.  Now leave your house.  Go ahead.  Just walk down the street.  They're always fat with a house dress and that thousand-yard marine stare.  That's so annoying. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, God.  That thousand-yard.  Hi, Joker.  She's just looking through walls with her x-ray vision.  Awful fat.  Wowie kazowie.  That was nuts.  She really is irritating.  She's got some problems.  A few issues.  I'm not your daddy.  Then a minute later, my daddy.  I went to dog to the house.  Shut up.  Daddy, no.  No, daddy.  I got no tolerance.  I really, really.  I'm not talking about retarded people.  I'm talking about nuts.  Retarded people I empathize with, but nuts I just cannot stomach. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Right.  I don't know what we did right there, but...  That was a little bit of fun.  We did something.  We'll continue.  We've got to talk about the softball game.  Steve-O's coming in today, Anthony.  Yes.  Lots and lots to do.  And our first cheerleader here.  Oh, really?  Yes.  For the game?  Mm-hmm.  That's right.  We're doing open tryouts.  All you have to do is stop on down if you want to be part of our celebrity slash bikini  softball game on June 1st.  All right.  Just come on down to the station and show us what you got.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, that's what, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Sure.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We haven't given out the phone numbers yet.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-2774.  Wow.  James wants in real fast here.  James, what's up?  Hello.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right, James.  Who am I speaking to? 
[00:38:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Cool, man.  Hey, you know what?  You know that putt plug thing?  You know where you can get it?  Over here.  I was telling you, buddy, over in Memphis this morning, sir.  What?  You were just doing a skit about a putt plug.  You were talking to somebody on the phone?  Yeah.  About 15 minutes ago, I was over in Medford, New Jersey.  You know where I was at?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know where you can get it?  Are you asking where can you get it?  Yeah, I'm telling you where you can get it.  Oh. 
[00:38:30]  The man told me where you can get it.  He told me what it was.  Where can you get it?  It's your tongue.  Oh.  Is that a little joke?  That's what the man told me.  James?  James, so you're saying that my tongue?  It's the butt plug.  Oh.  Oh, God, James.  Woo.  And who told you this, James?  His name's Jerry. 
[00:39:00]  Jerry.  And who's Jerry?  He was a pastor of a store of Manford.  So you called up to try to find one of these things?  No, it was there.  Hey, James, is the phone melting from your rotted teeth breath on it?  Yeah.  I can only imagine.  Yeah, I know.  Sounds like you don't have a tooth in your head.  It's your brain, man.  Oh, my brain.  I got it.  Wow.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hey, Dave.  Bye.  Bye.  You can't say that there, James.  That James really shoots from the hip. 
[00:39:30]  This is...  You know how to talk like that?  What's this?  Psychosis Monday?  I know.  Oh, what's...  Oh, you can't curse, you dopey, toothless zilch.  James, stop cursing.  Hey, yes.  Hey, listen.  That's the popcorn to get a black.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  You always had a bunny to corn.  And hold on.  All right, look.  We can't...  We're going to have to hang up on him.  Hold on.  He's cursing too much.  James, you're cursing too much. 
[00:40:00]  They're jumping on the show.  You're not allowed to curse on the radio.  How old are you, James?  Sixteen.  No, you're not.  James, it's sixteen.  I get it.  How old a gentleman are you?  Sixteen, man.  You're lying.  Where do you live, James?  In New Jersey.  And, all right.  Well, I guess we're going to let you go, James.  Yeah, we've had enough. 
[00:40:30]  Enough lunatics.  All right, James.  Oh, you've had enough lunatics, eh?  Sixteen.  Yeah, you've got to be really good.  Please, Barney, and see how they say that word.  Right.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  Maybe if he started smoking Lucky Strike at two, he'd be sixteen sounding like that.  James, what's your problem there? 
[00:41:00]  I don't know, man.  They exist some kind of psychosis.  What drugs are you on, James?  This is a natural, dude.  Have you been diagnosed with anything?  Oh, I need drugs.  That's what my problem probably is.  Do you work for a living?  What's that mean?  Well, do you work for a living?  No.  Do you live with your mom?  No.  You live by yourself?  No.  You live in a home? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, that's what this thing's called.  Where do you live, James?  New Jersey.  No, no, no.  But where?  Like in a mental institute?  Yeah.  Which one?  In Medford.  Yeah?  What's the name of the mental place that you're from?  It's some kind of rest hole they put you in.  They put you in a rest hole?  You're resting?  I'm trying to.  Do you have a roommate?  If I turn your radio station on, then I can't get no rest.  Do you have a roommate?  No, no. 
[00:42:00]  They won't let me in the room.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, hey.  James, stop with that.  What?  So why did they put you in there?  For a rest.  What?  What did you do?  Oh, thank you.  They just gave me my medicine.  Woo.  Oh, baby.  Now I can calm down.  Whoa.  I do believe he's lying.  What kind of medicine?  That's much more.  Thanks.  I'm thirsty.  Yeah, he's doing wacky characters.  What kind of medicine are you on? 
[00:42:30]  Pardon me?  What kind of medicine are you on?  Um, they got me on this course called Zoloft.  And, uh, Thurzine.  Great.  There you go.  All right, James.  You all right now?  Oh, yeah, man.  I feel much better.  Whew.  Yeah, yeah, because the medicine affects you that fast.  Yeah, yeah.  The Thurzine does.  Oh, yeah, man.  Why don't you call back tomorrow on Total Truth Tuesday and try to tell these lies then? 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right, man.  I'll listen for your program.  What time is your program?  Come on.  It comes on every day, right?  It's on now there, James.  All right.  Well, I'll call back on Total Truth Tuesday and I'll tell you real truth about your butt  plug.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome, man.  It's called Tongue.  Anthony.  Say it again.  All you need is...  Great joke.  Need is that guy and some beer.  You got a party.  Yeah, there's a party.  The last one soon.  I've been at a party. 
[00:43:30]  Everyone gathers around him and just laughs.  Come on, dude.  Do the crazy guy character.  Oh, no, no.  Well, okay, but just this once.  I think that guy was kooky, though.  Yeah, a little wacky, but then he tried to turn it into a bit.  Taylor, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I do psychology research and you might want to watch yourself on Play Home tonight.  Oh.  Have you ever heard about these celebrity stalkers?  She's from Massachusetts.  They develop these delusions and it just keeps building and building.  Like Mrs. David Letterman.  Remember her?  She used to turn up at David Letterman's house. 
[00:44:00]  Exactly.  And then you put...  You get...  Like, the more you reinforce it, the stronger it gets.  And then maybe she'll finally decide she wants that dog bad enough that Daddy didn't  say no anymore.  Have her sneak into my house and I'll choke the bitch right on the floor and do the world  a favor.  Exactly.  Do the gene pool a favor, man.  Right.  Well, she was definitely out of her mind.  Yeah.  I think that may need to be put away somewhere.  Get out of the population.  All right.  Thank you, Taylor.  I never understand the people like David Letterman. 
[00:44:30]  Remember Mrs. David Letterman?  Would follow this guy around and he'd go on vacation and then she'd show up at his house  and just live in there like it was his wife.  And then once she went to his house when he was there and Dave, what did he do?  He locked himself in a closet or something and called the cops?  He locked himself in his panic room.  Yeah.  Dave's panic room.  Hey, just kill her.  If someone goes in your house and they're a kook like that, do you think Dave would have  been in trouble if he killed the bitch? 
[00:45:00]  Hell no.  She finally wound up walking in front of a choo-choo train.  Isn't that great that she killed herself?  It's the best goddamn thing ever.  Ugh.  Someone goes in my house.  They're getting shot.  The government should just kill these people anyway because they're so aggravating.  They contribute nothing.  Right.  What is she like?  That fat one that called.  And yeah, you if you're listening.  What do you contribute?  Nothing.  She should lay on the train tracks and just let her fat legs get run over.  She contributes a half hour of good radio.  Well, there you go.  That's true.  You're right.  We need those cubs around.  They're called burdens to society. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  And they sit there.  You know, the wild kingdom, the wild kingdom out there on the plains of the Serengeti has  it all figured out.  If there's some fat lion that can hunt and lays down there with a broken leg or it's mental  or whatever it is, what do they do?  They leave it there until the jackals come out and rip its throat out at night.  You don't coddle it and make sure it's okay.  It weakens the rest of the herd and the pack and the pride. 
[00:46:00]  It weakens it.  So you eliminate it.  That woman's got no business living.  That's why, by the way, that's why I love cloning.  I'm all for cloning.  It's because you will not have fat retards like that calling in and writing letters.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You'll eliminate it.  Well, those genetics aren't looking too good.  You've only been pregnant for three days.  Let's suck that out and start over, shall we?  You could clone them for a new type of a target practice at the shooting range.  Imagine you just clone fat nothings like that, let them run loose, and you could just pow, 
[00:46:30]  pow, pop them in the knee, the head.  They're just clones.  They're useless.  And you get extra points if you can blow her hand off before she puts the food in her mouth.  If you blow her hand off with the cream pie in it, you get extra points.  Yodel and blood on her face.  Big dumb fatty with not one ounce of stick-to-itiveness or willpower.  It's all about your instincts, isn't it, you fat, deluded creep?  Yeah.  What is this?  Garrison, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  Hey, how's it going?  I got a clip of that chick you were talking to. 
[00:47:00]  Lynn?  Yeah, but she called herself Gargi.  Gargi?  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, hold on.  You want to play the clip or what?  Where'd you get this clip of Lynn?  Well, I have a website and it's called DJs That Suck.  I mean, I have this little place on my website, but I go onto different websites, listen to  these demos, and she was one of them.  What is going on today?  Garrison?  Yeah.  You're setting up for some wackiness here, aren't you? 
[00:47:30]  Well, no, no, no.  I have a clip of her.  Garrison.  Of the demo.  Garrison.  You're a handsome man, Mr. Garrison.  We have lost complete control of our own radio show.  You're setting up.  We're just clones of Don and Mike.  That's the point.  So let's see.  Oh, see?  Okay.  We're just clones of Don and Mike.  That's all you are.  Garrison.  Yeah.  There we go.  Don and Mike, the number one for 15 years in D.C.  Let him talk.  I love this.  Yes, Garrison.  15 years in D.C., and then you come in and ruin the ratings, and all of a sudden you're  number one, but I guarantee you your ratings are not half as good as Don and Mike.  Am I right?  Yeah.  You know something?  Yes. 
[00:48:00]  There you go.  We have just begun, my friend.  Yeah.  I'm right, right?  No, you're not really right.  No.  I'm not really right.  You called up on a whack.  You're a leech.  I'm a leech.  All you're doing is hanging on to ONA.  You're holding on to ONA.  You got to be people.  You got to be people to come to your comedy show.  And they do.  They do.  They show up, stupid.  They show up.  Why do they show up?  Garrison.  Garrison.  I have a little DJs that suck.  A little wacky bit. 
[00:48:30]  Let's up.  You coward.  You couldn't even be honest.  I just call and say.  Stop trying to force a laugh, because you have nothing to say.  Hey, I hope your mother falls into a ditch filled with razor blades, you faggot.  Warren, you don't have to be so heated.  What's the anger for?  Hey, Garrison.  Oh, stop trying to be.  Do me a favor.  Don't try to argue with the brilliant psycho.  I'll step back and be.  Stop it.  That does not work with me.  I want to talk.  You're not detached.  I want to talk for a moment.  Garrison.  All right.  I will speak with you honestly and openly. 
[00:49:00]  Garrison.  Let's be honest, though.  I'll be honest if you're honest.  Let's listen now.  You're talking about Washington ratings, right?  Don and Mike were in Washington, D.C. for 15 years, like you said.  Number one.  Number one, by far.  They did a great job in Afternoon Drive.  Can I talk?  Did a great job in D.C. getting those ratings up.  All of a sudden, O&A come to D.C.  We take over Afternoon Drive.  They go to Middays where they're doing fine in D.C. in Middays.  But Opie and Anthony's ratings in Afternoons took a nosedive plummet, which we talked about 
[00:49:30]  on this very show.  Yes.  Knowing, though, very confident that we would do well.  Yeah.  You're always doing good.  But just admit it's not half as good as Donna Mike did.  Garrison, but listen to me.  We have only been on.  Listen.  We've been on for a very short period of time in D.C.  We haven't even been on a year, my friend.  And we're already number one in the demo that we need to be number one?  Congratulations for that, but just admit it's not the ratings for Donna Mike. 
[00:50:00]  But it's going up.  It's not done going up yet.  Oh, all right.  And now, if you want to talk about your boys, why haven't they succeeded here in New York?  Whatever.  Answer it.  All right.  Thank you, Garrison.  Thank you, Garrison.  Why don't you answer it?  It's not half as good as Donna Mike.  Why don't you answer it?  Well, whatever.  I just wanted an answer, and I got none.  Thank you, Garrison.  Why don't you answer it, Garrison?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  More of the forced land. 
[00:50:30]  You guys suck.  You are the worst, dude.  Hey, Garrison.  Stop trying to psychoanalyze and argue that way.  You're a weak nothing.  Garrison, if you were a true fan of Donna Mike, you certainly wouldn't pick a fight with  us, okay?  Oh, why is that?  Just think about it.  You'd beat them in the Washington ratings?  Why don't you have an argument for what they just asked you?  They just...  I'm not going to need it.  I'm asking you a question.  No, you're not trying to force on you.  Answer the question.  If it wasn't for ONA, you wouldn't have any fans, ever.  You're probably right, stupid, but I do because of ONA.  But now I'm asking you, the anonymous zilch, to justify what you just said.  You're a third wheel. 
[00:51:00]  You're a third wheel.  No, Garrison, people are discovered all the time, and I realized this kid was talented,  so we brought him on board, and now, you know, he's proven himself.  You're a third wheel.  Exactly.  You're jealous wannabe.  Come on.  This is Garrison Paceworthy.  Come on.  Jim Norton, you're a third wheel.  What is Garrison Paceworthy?  What is that?  Garrison...  I ain't even giving him a plug.  I got dumped out of him.  There you go.  You're not getting a pass.  What are you, a comic?  You're a wannabe entertainer of some sort.  That's it.  I'm a wannabe entertainer.  What do you do?  I'm entertained.  What do you do?  I'm a student.  Ugh.  Ugh.  A student. 
[00:51:30]  Garrison, you're having a lot of laughs.  You probably never work.  No, I don't need to.  I make a lot more than a student.  You never make.  So what?  Because of ONA.  Garrison, you have...  So what?  Yeah, because of ONA.  You're stupid.  It happens all the time.  It's creative.  Someone has to discover you.  You're doing a lot of laughs today, okay?  I'll be on you.  Let me just tell you this much.  Just keep paying close attention to the ratings in Washington, and you watch what happens.  Good luck.  You'll never be as high as Donna Mike.  All right.  Hey, a year ago, they said we wouldn't even last three months.  All right.  You'll never be as high as Donna Mike. 
[00:52:00]  What happened?  What happened?  Garrison, we'll talk to you on Thursday.  I'll keep listening to the show.  Of course you will, because why do you listen if you don't like the show?  I just want you all to admit that you will never, ever be as high as Donna Mike.  Why would you listen?  Never listen.  I would never listen to a show I didn't like to.  I really would.  I love you, Norton.  Thank you, sir.  But I wouldn't listen to a show I didn't like.  I don't understand it.  Garrison, we...  I didn't say I didn't like the show. 
[00:52:30]  You have to listen to me carefully.  Oh, you said you guys suck.  You said the show sucks.  You just said that, so don't lie.  That's because you all aren't being honest with me.  I'm being honest with you.  Garrison, why don't you admit that Donna Mike don't seem to be getting ratings in New York?  I'll admit that Donna Mike have higher ratings than you'll ever have in D.C.  What's the problem with New York, Garrison, if you're such an expert?  I don't know.  I'm not from New York.  I'm not real familiar with New York, right?  Obviously not.  What are you from, D.C.?  Where are you from?  What part of that?  I said D.C.  I didn't hear you.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  I do love the Norton.  You're great.  You do like me?  Yeah.  Do you think we'll do well in Washington, Garrison?  You're doing well right now.  Very good.  I appreciate that.  We're going to be doing really, really well.  But you'll never be as high as Donna Mike.  Okay.  All right.  I wouldn't bet against that, my friend.  You would bet against that?  I said I wouldn't bet against that, my friend.  Oh, come on.  We're building a nice audience base.  That may be true, but you'll never be as great as Donna Mike.  Oh, just wait and see. 
[00:53:30]  Dude, you're not being consistent with Donna Mike.  Come on.  We'll never be.  Okay.  Well, Garrison has spoken.  In your weak impressions, Anthony, you think that's any better than Mike?  You see, dude, that's annoying.  If you said that O&A sucks and the show isn't funny, but to say Anthony's impressions are weak, you're just dishonest.  Come on.  It's aggravated.  And Garrison, as far as making it, Ant and I have made it in New York and in many cities all over the country.  Yo, it's very successful.  I think we've already made it in radio.  Dude, why are you explaining yourself to this?  Yeah, but you won't really make it in D.C.  He's trying to bait people. 
[00:54:00]  We're doing very well in D.C.  Garrison, we've already made it in D.C.  Well, that's debatable.  No, no, it's not.  You don't compare yourself to any other shows.  Garrison, we're already considered a hit in D.C.  It's a known fact.  If you don't compare yourself to any other shows, you have a point.  Uh-huh.  If you compare yourself to maybe other shows.  Thank you, Garrison.  Thank you.  Good job.  You're a liar, Garrison.  Love you guys.  I'll keep listening to the show.  Of course you will, because you're an empty nothing.  Of course you're going to listen.  All wannabes listen.  Keep cloning Don and Mike.  Maybe you'll get more listeners here in D.C.  Yeah, maybe we should. 
[00:54:30]  Hey, Garrison, I hope you had fun in the sun, because this will be the last time you're on our show.  That's it.  Enjoy it.  Don't play the tape back to yourself and your friends.  I will.  Good luck with that website.  Good luck with the whole website.  Listen to that laugh.  Do you just want to punch him?  No, I know.  I don't.  I actually, he's a failed entertainer.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something, dude.  There's nothing more embarrassing than a failed entertainer.  I love you, Norton.  It doesn't matter.  You're a failed entertainer.  What's the matter?  Didn't mommy and daddy support your little endeavor?  They made you go to college?  It's pretty easy to get under your skin, guys. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, will you stop trying to come off like the brilliantly detached guy who just wanted to get under your skin?  Look what I did.  I'll keep listening to the show.  Hey, by the way, do you know what a .8 is?  I know what a third wheel is.  You do too, Norton, don't you?  Yeah.  And it's easier than a .8.  Oh, don't you, Norton?  Believe me, I'm Theo Third Wheel, and I'm making good money, and I'm getting Hummers, and that is all that matters.  I love you guys.  All right.  Keep listening to the show.  Bye-bye.  Hope your mother gets cancer.  There he goes.  He doesn't even realize how stupid he just sounded.  There he goes. 
[00:55:30]  That's the best part of that whole call.  You know what's funny about the Washington thing is he's the same guy, yeah, that was saying we'll be out of Washington in six months, and, you know, it's over.  It's an awful thing.  They'll never make it in D.C.  And now that we are, he's very annoyed with this fact that we're doing well.  Well, so then they have to come up with something else.  They do the same thing in New York.  Yeah.  You know, the critics always have to come up with something new.  Of course.  And we'll do great in D.C. 
[00:56:00]  We're doing great.  When we went down there, the listeners that came out to the station, it was one of the best turnouts we've ever had at a station.  It was amazing.  Yeah, it was amazing.  And the ratings going up.  Up, up, up, up, up in D.C.  I guarantee we're going to have a turn come out sometime this week for D.C.  We're going to be up again.  I do believe Thursday.  That's a guarantee.  Mm-hmm.  I got no problem with a guy that calls up and goes, oh, you suck.  You know, that's good.  But it's like when someone's dishonest about, like, well, you know, just stop. 
[00:56:30]  Just make your point.  Stop trying to be smug.  You can be a huge fan of any show you want, but if you're going to call up and bash another show and base that on how big of a fan you are of a different radio show, you better be prepared that, you know, your radio show you're a fan of is going to get a little dented, a little bruised in that conversation.  That's all.  Garrison.  That's always a laugh.  I just don't like people that call up that he wouldn't say what he really does.  He's obviously a failed entertainer, and there's just nothing more embarrassing than a failed entertainer. 
[00:57:00]  Look at the embarrassed, the poor, embarrassed people from D.C. now having to check in and apologize.  I'm reading apologies from D.C.  Oh, my God.  Please, this guy does not represent D.C.  Our garrison is a moronic garrison.  It's Rob from Delaware.  No, we've got a good relationship with D.C. now.  Of course.  I think that guy ain't going to wreck it for us.  All right, Ant. 
[00:57:30]  Steve-O's here.  Really easy to get under your skin, huh?  Well, Norton, it was.  You were screaming.  I really am.  Because I hate, I don't, if a guy just called up and said you suck, it doesn't make me as annoyed as some little smug liar.  Like, nope, nope, nope, that's the way it is.  Got you there, Norton.  Got you there, Norton.  That's a faggot with no point.  Those are the guys that you just want to just drill your fist into their sternum.  I'm sure he's been punched many, many times.  And again, he may have a big, delicious mule.  Who knows?  All right, Ant, we've got Steve-O.  We've got Steve-O in the studio and our first cheerleader. 
[00:58:00]  That's what we were supposed to do here.  Take a look.  But Garrison ruined it.  So we'll step aside.  We'll come back with Steve-O.  Rich from Philly asking if we're waiting until 5.20 to talk to a sane person today.  Yeah, we're not going to be talking to a sane person in Steve-O.  What the hell's going on today?  It's Mental Illness Monday.  Okay.  There it is.  Mental Illness Monday.  What's tomorrow?  Total Truth Tuesday?  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Uh-huh.  We just need something for Thursday and Friday. 
[00:58:30]  We're all set.  Great.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  I'd like to leave a big F.U. to my husband.  The guy that's supposed to be my husband.  F*** you.  You know who you are.  I can't say your name, but you're f***ing stuck.  You won't f***ing see me.  You won't f***ing talk to me.  I'm f***ing mad at you.  How f***ing dare you?  Return my phone calls, because I'm still your f***ing wife.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to my former employer, who decided they didn't want my ass around,  and they simply fired me for no reason, with no notice. 
[00:59:00]  Thanks a lot, guys.  F.U.  Damn siflitic gorilla after seeing episode two.  Yoda f***ing fighting with a lightsaber ain't worth f***ing two and a f***ing quarter hours  of my goddamn life.  It sucks so bad that I f***ing can't stand to watch anything related to the Star Wars  anymore.  I'm going to smash everything I own, Star Wars related, with a goddamn hammer. 
[00:59:30]  Anyway, f*** you, George Lucas.  You raped my childhood.  Bye.  End of messages.  You want to touch it?  This isn't happening to me.  Go on.  Touch it.  I'm not face down in a pillow.  Touch it.  With my little baseball cleats on.  Go on.  While the coaches touch it.  Teaching me a lesson.  Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Woo!  What's up, man?  Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier.  Yes.  An old friend of ours stopped by.  He did ten years in the joint for murdering someone. 
[01:00:00]  Not Eddie.  No, I swear to God.  Yeah.  Ten years in the joint for murdering someone.  Right there.  And Steve-O's in the studio as well.  Wait, wait.  Everyone get on mic.  All right.  Well...  And I don't think you're allowed to be drinking.  Oh, me?  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  Come on.  The man's on parole, right?  Ten years you got?  Ten years.  That's it?  Get on the mic, though.  Yeah, dude.  Grab that one.  Give Steve-O that one.  All right.  And, um... 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I kind of remember hearing about this.  You talk about it at all?  A little bit.  Every now and then.  Did it help you like...  Hey, Steve-O, talk.  All right.  Steve-O's really messed up.  I...  Yeah, I'm, once again, pretty damn wasted.  That's good.  Really excited.  I always want a wasted Steve-O.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I'm excited.  I didn't even know.  Like, I knew that, uh...  I mean, you said to me and a guy, like,  Hey, how's it going?  I killed someone.  And it's like... 
[01:01:00]  But then, like, that's why you're here, though.  Well, he's...  Yeah.  He just stops by from time to time.  Yeah.  Every now and then.  Obviously, like, from time to ten years, like...  Well, no.  He's been out for a while.  There's a difference between, like,  Yeah, I killed somebody.  All right.  What'd you do?  Well, I was driving home drunk one night  And I hit some kid on a bike, you know.  Eh.  Yeah, but then again...  And then there's, you know,  I shot somebody.  So, uh...  How did...  How did this happen?  Well, actually, I was looking for a vehicle.  I was in Manhattan picking up some angel dust.  Yeah.  Is this true?  Yes.  Yeah, this is true, man. 
[01:01:30]  No Colombians were involved.  No, no, this is...  All right.  I got to preface this by saying  the story about the air is really true.  Because he went to prison.  And the guy did his time.  Where do they get off calling it angel dust  when it's so slimy?  Love that stuff.  Do you?  Yeah, half the cops that come for noise complaints  don't even know what it smells like.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  They're like, you know,  you open the door and, like,  you're being really loud.  It's like, man, like, good thing.  Like, these guys really can't smell. 
[01:02:00]  I mean, you got to smoke it with your pot, right?  No, we used to put...  We used to smoke dust in just a bowl.  It's totally indigenous in New York.  Really?  Yeah, it really, really is.  The one time I enjoyed it in Florida,  it was, you know, sent down from New York.  From New York, so it's like...  Well, they mix it with pot.  That's all what dust is,  is embalming fluid.  Yeah, they mix it with pot.  Parsley, really.  Yeah, really.  Yeah, parsley.  And it's just smoking the embalming fluid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's the only thing.  I know, and the embalming fluid is a fluid, 
[01:02:30]  not a dust.  Right.  I guess that's what makes it so slimy.  I don't know why they call it dust, right?  It should be fluid.  So what happened now?  You're looking at a cop.  Yeah, some dust.  Yeah, I was looking at a cop.  Some dust.  And this guy, he's like...  He tried to take my money,  and I had a crowbar on my hand.  I cracked him in the back of his head.  And I just...  How'd you crack him in the back of the head?  How did he try to take the money?  He was running.  He took my...  I gave him the, you know, the sale.  Were you in a vehicle?  No, I was standing...  You're standing there.  Yeah.  And how did you know he was selling dust?  I asked him who got diesel. 
[01:03:00]  Who got diesel?  Who got diesel?  So the guy goes, yo, I got diesel.  Was it a white guy or a black guy?  He was a black guy.  He was a black guy.  So he goes, yo, I got...  Yo, I got diesel.  So he goes...  Did he give you a price?  Yeah.  And then you go in your pocket...  I gave him the money.  ...you dig it out.  Now, he don't have no fridge.  He doesn't have no dust.  He's just looking to get Whitey's money.  Exactly.  So he grabs your cash.  Right.  He grabs your cash, shoves it in the pocket, or he just grabs it and turns around and starts  running.  He was already running.  He was running.  Why did you have the crowbar in your hand to start with?  Yeah, that's my question.  I was 15 years old at the time, and I'm a young white boy in Manhattan. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  What are you going to do?  And this guy came up to you, and he was going to try to rip you off with the crowbar?  No, I had it in my coat.  Oh, okay.  I had it in my coat.  Everything's concealed.  Now, if you brought a crowbar, why'd you bother, like, pulling out the bill?  Right?  I mean...  Just hit him.  You whack him, you grab the diesel.  I mean, it seems like he was looking for trouble.  He had the crowbar.  But he's also got a bottle in his hand.  So now he goes to run. 
[01:04:00]  Are you running after him?  I'm running right after him.  And you catch him.  I hit him in the back of the head.  And you hit him in the back of the head, and he goes right down.  He goes down.  And then you leave.  I take my money and go.  Now, what?  Now, you didn't actually get the drugs?  Oh, you know.  Because he didn't have them.  So he just got the money in his hand still.  You took the money.  Was he going, oh, or anything?  I don't know.  Honestly, I was scared to death.  So you grab it, and you run.  Cracked his hand.  No, you got away with that.  Now, who saw this?  This isn't the reason he went to the joint.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  No.  What self-respecting black drug dealer gets caught by a chubby Italian guy? 
[01:04:30]  He wasn't chubby back then.  Back then, I wasn't chubby.  He was self-respecting.  That garrison got you, didn't he, Jimmy?  Wait a minute.  Jimmy ran to check out his approval rating after that phone call.  This is the guy I thought he might have killed.  He doesn't know if the guy died or not.  All I know is I cracked him in the back of the head, and he was gone.  All right.  No one died, because we ain't going down that road.  All right.  Has anybody heard about any?  He's fine.  He's living in Brooklyn with a happy family.  Right.  I ain't going down that road. 
[01:05:00]  They actually have had a reunion, and they shook hands.  There you go.  Okay.  No, he went to the joint for something else.  Now, what was the one you went to the joint?  Three armed robberies.  Three armed robberies.  Wait a second.  I thought you were a murderer.  Yeah.  I thought you went for murder.  Did you kill someone during an armed robbery?  There were shots fired and people injured.  And people injured?  All I know is I was with two people.  You were with two people.  I was with two people.  What were you, the wheel man?  No.  If I would have been a wheel man, we would have got away.  Uh-oh. 
[01:05:30]  Believe you me.  So what were you robbing?  Banks?  Gas stations?  Gas stations.  Gas stations.  So low class, bro.  I know, right?  You said robberies, right?  Now you only got nailed for one?  No, I got nailed for all three.  If you're going to pull out a gun and rob something, make it a goddamn bank.  You know, I'm sitting here looking at the table.  Gas stations.  60K for on jewels.  You're not dying, sonny.  You're killing everyone all around you.  You're killing everyone all around you.  Now, when you did these robberies, was it for drugs?  Were you moved on to more expensive stuff? 
[01:06:00]  Actually, it was for heroin.  Oh, there you go.  See, because all you have to do, really, is put yourself in a wheelbarrow and have a friend  and roll you downstairs.  You get all the drug money you want.  Maybe you have a friend cracking your head with a bad...  Hey, I've got some experience with that sort of...  That's exactly where I was going there, Steve-O.  Now, no one died during these robberies.  So you didn't go to jail for killing somebody?  Now, it's three separate convictions, right?  For reckless endangerment, I put a hot gun in this guy's mouth. 
[01:06:30]  I was going to blow his head off.  Oh!  How'd you get caught for all three?  Wow, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Armed robbery just came down to reckless endangerment?  Endangerment, yeah.  So it was a lot.  It was, uh...  It was like you intended to do the armed robbery, but you only actually, like...  Well, I shot...  There were shots fired.  I put the gun in the guy's mouth.  And I said, if you do not open up the cash register, I will pull the trigger and your brains  will be splattered.  And how did that...  Don't, don't...  And did he release Johnny for a $1,000 certified check? 
[01:07:00]  No, no, but how did you get away with that and, like, um, you know...  Like, what lawyer got you reckless endangerment for that?  Actually, thank God for, uh, public offenders.  Oh, you got a public defender?  So, so now you, uh, you go to court and they give you how many years?  Well, they wanted to give me 10 to 20.  10 to 20.  No, I didn't take it.  All right.  I took 7 1⁄2 to 15.  And you served?  10.  10.  And how was that for you?  And where, where do you fit in the other convictions, like, for armed robbery? 
[01:07:30]  What do you mean?  I guess that was for the whole shmear.  It was all, the whole shmear.  Yeah, that was the whole shmear.  The whole shmear.  So now you get...  So once they had you, they said, oh, yeah, like, oh, now...  Other people must have fastened and caught.  Yes, exactly.  All right.  Did the guys that you were with get caught?  My co-defendant?  Yeah.  Yeah, he ratted me out.  All right.  He got less time, didn't he?  He got 5 to 10.  Were you able to secure heroin in prison?  All the time.  And now I got to ask you, did you get, did you get nailed in the, in the...  Not once.  No, no.  Not once.  Did they try? 
[01:08:00]  No one tried.  No one tried to get you?  Nope.  It's almost insulting, isn't it?  Just walking around nude in the cell block.  Hello!  Dropping soap, yelling, oops.  So no one died.  It's in the cafeteria, though.  I think, honestly, asking a good chick, asking a guy if she looks fat in a dress.  You just...  Well, you want to know something?  Let me tell you something.  No way.  No, no.  Let me tell you something.  I'll tell you straight up.  Yeah.  Because a man will tell you straight up if he got screwed in...  You know, I... 
[01:08:30]  A man will tell you because you want to know something?  No matter how you are, four people come up on you and roll you and take your ass.  You want to know something?  You can't stop that.  I don't care what anybody says.  Who'd want to?  Oh, my God.  Just remember, it's not gay if you don't push back.  Man, hey.  Jeez.  If your bros are filming it, it is not gay.  All right, so no one died, Anthony.  No one died in that, but he did save time for an armed robbery. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  So we got to the bottom of that.  Now, your girlfriend, Dee, is naked outside of the door.  What's Dee doing naked?  Nice.  Steve-O's girlfriend, Dee.  Bring that lunatic in here.  We had a great time with these two last time they were in New York.  Hey, Dee, how you doing?  There she is.  Hey, Dee, watch out.  This guy's following.  Look how bubbly she is.  What?  What?  You want to fight?  What is she saying?  Hey, you want to fight?  How you doing today, Dee?  I'm good.  I'm good.  You're doing good?  Yeah.  I see you got yourself a beverage. 
[01:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah?  And you've been going all day?  Yeah.  That's cool.  Since 6 a.m.  Since about 6 a.m.  You're drinking.  And anything else?  Any fun?  No chemicals?  Are you holding out on her?  Come on, you slouch.  Give her a toot.  She's going to give me that toot.  A toot.  I'm like, I'm so 80s.  I don't know, man.  Like, the toot.  I mean, that's a...  I've been doing it.  Oh, my goodness.  Like, all day.  Look at her.  She just lifted her shirt up, and she's showing those lovelies. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, not only are these boobs beautiful, she's got deadly accuracy rolling pool balls out  of them.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't know I had...  Would you lean over pool table and drop the ball down her cleavage?  Yeah.  Leans forward.  Because I had this idea.  I'm like, man, I need a nifty way to break a light bulb.  I need another lump on my head.  What?  We came here basically, like, with the entire concept that dropping a light bulb... 
[01:10:30]  Wait, no.  Dropping a light bulb.  A pool ball.  Yeah, the pool ball.  Dropping it on a man's head just never gets old.  That's why I've got my hair so closely shaven.  You know, because, like, I want to see some lumps.  Cue balls are...  Now, it doesn't take much height for them to start hurting when they drop on your head.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  When our boobs to the ground, like, hurts, like, that'll stay funny probably three times.  Well, let's do some...  Do you have a cue ball with you? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, let's do some things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We brought the...  No, no.  Hey, eight ball.  An eight ball.  Oh, okay.  That makes more sense.  Could we see that one?  Oh, man.  Could you roll it off your boobs and knock them in the head?  I think we can pretty much keep doing that for hours.  And it's so much better than a Cleveland steamer because you don't have to bring saran wrap.  You want to get this done before the break there?  Well, yeah, let's do that really quick.  I'd love to see that.  Let's check out this little thing.  I think it's hysterical.  Yeah, it's crazy how I came in here during the commercial break and, like... 
[01:11:30]  You have raging lesbians, too.  We were on...  Where?  Outside?  She's like, I knew I was here for a reason.  Oh, really?  They're trying out for our softball.  Do you like chicks, Dee?  You into chicks at all?  She likes everything.  Look at her.  You like girls?  Yeah?  Anything?  Yeah.  Does she have an all-over tan?  Do you like...  Are you tan everywhere?  Because you took your shirt off.  Hey, she's no longer sporting the racing.  Really?  No.  No.  No?  I can't remember.  We've got a bald eagle.  Uh-oh.  Oh, really? 
[01:12:00]  He's lying.  You didn't completely go down a wood floor?  You're not sporting the JonBenet Ramsey type...  No.  ...hairstyle?  I'm pretty into the George Michael stubble.  You like the George Michael stubble?  Hey!  Hey!  Oh, man.  Let me see that, because that's pretty heavy.  All right.  It's a real eight ball, and she's just going to roll it off her boobs on the top of your  head there.  We've got to mic Steve up for this, because I'm sure he's going to have to get down to  the floor.  Steve, what do you lay on the...  Like, simply with the goal to break a light bulb, you know? 
[01:12:30]  So, I mean, just...  Like, I think the light bulb actually, even though, like, it cut my head, like, it cushioned  the blow.  Like, we're going to find out...  Did it?  Because that's got to hurt, man.  I mean...  It's on purpose, you think?  Yeah.  The light bulb's pushing the blow, but, like, I just know the more it hurts, the more funny  it's going to just...  Absolutely right, man.  What, do you lay down, or you sit, or...  It's naked, right?  It's more of a...  It's more of a boob stuff.  I need...  Well, yeah.  D is now topless, isn't it?  There you go.  Now we're just going to drop it off. 
[01:13:00]  D's got the eight ball between her lovely, lovely...  Yeah.  Oh, the shirt's coming completely off now.  Top half.  Nice, nice, nice.  Should we just go for a back of the dome right now?  All right.  All right, we're going to Mike Stee.  He's on his, like, knees and elbows.  He's very close to it.  Yeah, don't worry.  It's just going to hurt more.  Ow!  Oh, my God!  Are you a fool?  Oh, my God!  Dude, how does that feel?  What is that? 
[01:13:30]  Does that hurt really bad?  It's like when you stick your hand under hot water, and it's so hot, like, you can't  even tell it's hot.  Don't worry, like...  That's just going to stay funny.  I got a lot of things to talk about today that I probably shouldn't.  All right, well, why don't we take a break, and we'll get into it.  Yeah, we'll just drop the pool ball in my head a bunch.  Yeah, I would definitely be into seeing that, like, ten more times.  Did you hear that?  Nice.  Are we plugging anything today, too? 
[01:14:00]  No one knows.  All right.  They don't know.  Oh, you're okay, man?  Let me see.  A bump?  I don't know, man.  That's not a good spot-related checkbook.  Yeah, you got to get it, like, right at one of the sides.  What we got to do is, like...  Yeah, well, take some shots of all the areas.  Yeah, that was pretty good, man.  I didn't know I had...  Anthony, as we go to break, we got a stupid little song from Hayseed...  What the hell?  Huh?  Hayseed Dixie.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Hayseed Dixie.  Remember those guys that did the Hayseed Dixie songs?  Uh-huh.  Check out this, too.  Are you ever going to be super bonded by smoking yet?  Yep.  Eh, do what you want.  Ah, do what you want.  If you give us good radio, who cares?  Check this out.  Okay.  Keeping your poop in a jar  Till the day you come back  So don't forget just what you are  Yeah, keeping your poop in a jar  You thought you took everything  But you left something behind me 
[01:15:00]  I scooped it out  I bottled it up  Now it's there on a stand by the bed  To remind me  In case I ever forget  You're just a piece of poop  Keeping your poop in a jar  Till the day you come back  So don't forget just what you are  Yeah, keeping your poop in a jar  I'll play with some drums  I had a moment of weakness for us 
[01:15:30]  I had a moment of weakness for us  So I opened the lid for a smell  It all came back to me, baby  One laborers rush 
[01:16:00]  I remembered you well  How could I ever forget  Oh, but you're a piece of poop  I'm keeping your poop in a jar  Till the day you come back  Till the day you come back  So don't forget just what you are  Yeah, keeping your poop in a jar  Oh, everybody sing  Keeping your poop in a jar 
[01:16:30]  Till the day you come back  So don't forget just what you are  Yeah, keeping your poop in a jar  Keeping your poop in a jar  Keeping your poop in a jar  Keeping your poop in a jar  Oh, oh, please  Oh, oh, please 
[01:17:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony show  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show today  Oh, man  Steve-O in the studio 
[01:17:30]  It's never boring when he's in here  He's feeling his head to see if he's got a lump yet  We were talking about that whole eight ball thing he just did  Right before we went to break  The lovely D took her shirt off  Took an eight ball from a pool table  Rolled it through her cleavage  And onto Steve-O's head  As Steve was laying on the floor  I mean, like that was probably like a four foot drop  That was about four feet  I give it about four feet  I don't know anything  I can't figure out the velocity and acceleration of that 
[01:18:00]  But rest assured, it made a loud noise and it hurt  It was a nice thud  And I want that being a continuing theme throughout your appearance here  Like the spot where I landed that time  It's like that natural knot  Yeah, that natural little knot area  So I don't know if I got a lump out of it or not  Why don't we go for the  You want to go for the top or the  Yeah, like a  No, the right side  Yeah, the temple  Kind of the temple area  The temple  Well, not the side of your head  Yeah, the side of the head 
[01:18:30]  I literally shaved my hair  Like so  Like brighteningly close  So, you know, because I want to see some lumps  Right  Let's see if we can't make a lump  You want to do it again?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Let's do it  All right, where's  D, you want to help him out?  Where's awesome Garrett?  And there's the eight ball  Wow  You guys are sick  By the way, Anthony  We should tell people  They got to go to stevovideo.com  Oh, yeah  For the last chance to get the extreme footage  Before it gets edited to a sale in store 
[01:19:00]  Oh, this was amazing  We watched this, like, over and over and over  The last video you put out  It's amazing  It's sick  And you watch it  And you can't even believe  You're really doing this stuff  Definitely cool  But they're going to edit it for the stores?  Well, yeah, I mean, like  They're going to calm it down a little bit?  It's weird  I mean, like, the thing about, like  The way that we've been doing it  Like, I somehow or other, like  In a way, like, kind of bumped  Girls Gone Wild  Out of, like, late night television commercials 
[01:19:30]  Like, I've had this, like, stevo video, like  Commercial  And, like  That's, like  You can, like, get distribution going  Like, sell so many copies  But, like  Whether, like  Whether or not, like  Millions of people have bought the video  Simple fact is  That millions and millions of people  Know it exists in the first place  Right?  You know?  I mean, like  Because the whole point of it  Is it's just  So  Unacceptable for TV  Like  Absolutely  There's no way 
[01:20:00]  You can even show pieces of this  Yeah, and, like  We haven't had any standards  To be rated by  Like  There's not been, like  Our  You know, it's just  No, there's no rating this thing  It's such garbage, like  It's such garbage  I mean  Honestly  And now, like  Like, we've really done well  To let everyone know  Like, this video's out there  Like, people have seen it  Like, maybe they don't want to call up  With their credit card  And, like  You know  They just picture Steve  Like, with all the credit card numbers  Going out to eat  Oh, yeah  Copping drugs  Totally  With the people's  Totally  Credit card numbers 
[01:20:30]  Look, dude  But now, like  Not a lot of products hit the shelves  Like, with, like  A quarter million of dollars  Like, spent on advertising  Before I even  So people don't have to, like  Read the back cover  They're like  Oh, there it is  You know  And they know exactly  What they're getting  Yeah, but for them to see it  On a shelf  Means we're going to lose  A lot of footage  You know, like  We really, like  They're going to, like  Force us to, like, tone it down  Like, to make it, like  Retail acceptable  And, like  Hey, man  I never said  I wasn't going to sell out  What are they  What are they  Getting rid of?  Oh, man  What's this?  Are they getting rid of 
[01:21:00]  The vodka ID?  That's, uh  Is D on fire on the table?  No, no  Like that  Oh, they got rid of  D on fire?  Oh, man  That was for the  Too Hot to Exist video  Yeah  I'm not actually sure  Like, what the implications are  But I just know that, like  Jacking it on the desk  Yeah, like  That's going to have  A tough time  Oh, yeah  I don't know, like  What it is  But it's pretty much  Like, we're here to say  Hey, like  If you haven't joined  The Steve-O army yet  You know, like  Do it now  Because let's just keep  The full on, like  You know  Full level of just how 
[01:21:30]  Balls out  Out of control  I want to see another  Eight ball hit  Yeah, yeah  I got to see this again  This  Never, ever old  We really got a mic  Of better this time  So you hear the thud  Get the mic down there  I'm going to tilt it over  So we get, like  The temple kind of  And it's kind of hard for us  Because I know  All we want to do  Is go like  Oh, right when it hits  But let's try to be quiet  So we can hear the thud  And Steve's reaction  I'm going top of the head  I think  For the best part  And any excuse to get  Dee's shirt off  Is a winner in this studio 
[01:22:00]  Everyone wins  All right, Dee  Completely topless again  Anthony, she's got  The eight ball  Between her boobies  Yeah, here we go  Shh, shh, shh  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  I think we got  I think we got points  You think we got bumpage  Yeah  Yeah  Oh, man  Oh, my God  That sounded great, dude  Sweet 
[01:22:30]  Oh, wow  Because I know  Like, you guys need  To actually school me  And like, yeah  Just keep it off  Dee, God bless you  God bless you  See, now she's just  Sitting with her shirt off  Yeah, well, that's what she does  I don't know  Did you notice?  She's sitting with her shirt off  Beautiful  You guys have to teach me  How to voice my true frustration  About this circumcision business  Without getting like  Yeah, I hear you have  Like a problem with it  Just, if you're going to mention  The unit  Just call it a mule  Now, wiener?  No 
[01:23:00]  You know why?  It's too  In certain contexts  It's too much of a clue  Of what's going on  Okay  So if you just call  That area, whatever  A mule  We'll be okay  A mushroom pole?  Wait, Dee  Dee has a question  Wait, Dee  Yes, Dee?  Dee said something to me  About a mule  That I said something last time  What was it about a mule?  Oh, yeah  You don't remember that?  I don't know  Because Norton was talking  About his mule  And you had an answer  We got it on tape  We got it on tape  Yeah, the mule  Yeah, the mule 
[01:23:30]  Oh, that was so readily accepted  Like, that was really on the ready  That was great  Are we that cool?  Yeah, the mule  Oh, we had like six months in that  We play that one all the time  We love that  It's great  Yeah, the mule  And she said  I have a goat  Or something like that  I had a goat  I had a goat  You had a goat?  What happened to the goat?  As I try to look her in the eye  I know, it's like  Try to look her in the eye  And then they go  Your eyes kind of move  In scientific terms  Yeah  Is it wrong to describe a circumcision? 
[01:24:00]  That's like kind of in the context  Of like what's scientific and objectionable  Yeah, but you know something  They probably have a problem with it  Just for what we talk about  Just for where I'm heading with it  But like let's be careful  What's your problem with it?  Yeah, if you're talking code, man  People will get it  Okay, now like  My problem is  It's kind of like threefold  Okay  Number one being  That I have yet to hear about a circumcision  In large 
[01:24:30]  No, that was a  Yeah, but they don't like that word  Mule  Oh, okay  Mule junk  You've never heard of a circumcision  I've never  Makes one larger  Yeah, makes it larger  I've never heard of a circumcision  Extending a mushroom pole  Okay, good  A mushroom pole  That's a clever little  He likes that  Mushrooms  All right  Now  Hey, hey, mushrooms  Now  My  And now  Mushroom is on  So  I think that we've  Fairly well established  That  You know 
[01:25:00]  A man's not going to be  More in doubt  Over a circumc  Oh, but right  You know  And now  It's also not  A choice  That's all it makes  No, because you're an infant  At the time  Exactly  Okay, so  No choice  That's two prongs  Of your three prong strategy  Yeah  What's the third prong?  No, like  This is the  The real problem  Right here  This is like  This is the outrage  Is  Is that  Like  We've had enough  Like  Scientific research 
[01:25:30]  We've had enough  Like  Psychology  We've had enough  To know that  Developmental psychology  Is so critical  And  Like by the age of six  You've pretty much  Got your personality set  You're either going to be  A kook  You're going to be  A normal guy  You're going to be shy  You're going to be this  That  Okay  And no one's really  Going to argue  Steve-O  I'm with you  I'm sticking with you  Yeah  We've got  No one denying  That the first experiences  We have  Are the most important  In the way our personality  Is going to develop  Right  So now 
[01:26:00]  How does that make it  Appropriate  To make an infant's  First experience  The most critical one  Involve the dismemberment  Of his wah-wah  It prepares him  For all relationships  With women  Right  Emasculation  Now I'm picturing  The person that's actually  In charge of this procedure  That's true  Right  So it's too traumatic  For the little fellow  Traumatic  Yeah  Like  Like  The cliche  Of entering the world  As in  It doesn't make any sense  At all  Steve I'm listening to you 
[01:26:30]  Even though I'm not  Looking at you  We're all listening to you  If there's anything  You don't do to a baby  It's  It's bum  Bum the baby out  Right  It's going to have  Long lasting  Don't bum the baby out  But the first thing  They do is  The most severe  Bummage of a baby  I mean like  Just to put into perspective  How much of a bummer  It is  Like  Let's say you  Aren't circumcised  Would you be  Running down  To get one right now  Absolutely not  Why do we do  When he says  You would look funny though  Yeah I mean  Well I mean 
[01:27:00]  Chances are  I mean like  Say how many people are  Steve what do you prefer  Do you prefer  The  I don't care  But the point is  It's not going to  There's more people  Circumcised than not  Right  No I don't think so  So if you're not  Not in the world  What's wrong with my stuff  Now Steve  Or my junk  Back to the point  There was a point  Yeah back to the point  Okay your point  Let's get back to Steve's point  What we're talking about  Is little babies  That are crying  Having a miserable experience  That is never  Going to contribute 
[01:27:30]  To their girth  Or length  And now the guy  In charge of this procedure  Is some wacky dude  That like somehow  Just slices up  The garbage  So to speak  Yeah  And then that  Bastard is going to  Try and tell me  I'm doing something  Wrong for society  Oh okay  Now I see  Where his point is  He's bringing it back  To himself  Where people call you crazy  Exactly  Yet there's a doctor  Out there 
[01:28:00]  And it's perfectly acceptable  For him to disfigure children  Exactly  And the scariest thing  Being that there's  Religious implications  Right  In his role  In this procedure  No the scariest thing  Is I completely  Am understanding  What Steve was talking about  These people  These people are using  These people are using  Their position  Their position in society  As a sausage slicer  Right  So you're not the real kook  He's not the real kook  Of course not  It's just like man  There are kookier people  Out there  You know  I don't hurt anyone  But myself bro man  Steve you're absolutely right 
[01:28:30]  Can we celebrate  This revelation  By dropping another  Eight ball on your head  Eight ball  Eight ball  Eight ball  Eight ball  Actually Jay has a request  On the line  Oh really  I'm going to go  Celebrate an eight ball  In the bathroom  Hold on Jay  Jay what's up  Jay  Oh hey  First of all  We want to support you guys  Over here  Alright thank you Jay  Thornton you rule  Hey I got a new trick  If Steve and Steve  Are up for it  Yeah  How about  If Steve releases the ball  I think the upward

[01:43:30]  Disappointed  I think we're all disappointed  Dee at this point  No we're not  Baby  You're mad  Baby quit attacking girls  I'm not  I'm just  I said it this morning  It has nothing to do with her  See exactly what I mean  This girl's hot though  Not my fault  Everywhere I go  I didn't even share  Any of my snooters with Dee  You could share the hotness  With Danielle right  Yeah  Look at Danielle's legs  They're amazing  That's great  Long and lovely  No one is allowed  To be hot  When Dee is in the room  Exactly  That's right  Dee is the hottest 
[01:44:00]  Let's all remember that  All right  All right  Oh she's got the horn  That was sweet  Like you didn't hear that one  That was a great  That was really a good thought  And you're going to have  A great lump on that  Danielle thank you  Danielle your father is here  Yeah  He brought you down  Yeah  No I came down  You came down  She wouldn't have come without her dad  Now you have a very attractive daughter there sir  Thank you  Sir  Thank you  I'll say  How old a gal are you  If you don't mind me saying  If you do 
[01:44:30]  I'm in Jersey though  I just drove up  And your jersey  Oh  I'm sorry  19  Oh so you're  Wow  Teen  I'm 19  You brought down your teen dad  Young  How about that  Just legal tender  Very good  And you absolutely are in  As a bikini girl  Thank you  On our softball game  Evo's digging the teen  I can tell  You know I'm more digging her dad  For being so cool  To just say  Let's go do this  I know that without her dad  She wouldn't be here  It's pretty cool  Well literally  Well technically yeah  You're right  Quite literally 
[01:45:00]  Alright we got  Okay from my son too  Oh really  Yes  We got our first cheerleader  For the game Anthony  She was pushed into it  By her  The last people you'd ever think  Would push her into it  Yes  Her brother and her dad  Alright  She's got the whole  Roselle Park Police Department  Listening  Oh  Man how far is that town  So you'll be down there  And we're looking for any other girls  That want to come down  And be bikini girls  Right on the field  You're going to have one of the best seats  In the house  To all the festivities 
[01:45:30]  Is that 8000 people venue  Oh yeah  It's going to be insane  It's going to be crazy  June 1st  And girls  See how easy that is  You just come down  And that's it  Wait a second  Let's  She did a stunt  Dealing with what I'm dealing with  From D right now  Well  They have it a little easier  They have it a little easier  I'm here  That's not your fault  But you're going to tell me  Everyone's a normal thing  That's not a normal thing  That's not a normal thing  That has nothing to do with you  That's me  That's my problem  It has nothing to do with you 
[01:46:00]  Ten times  Nine times out of ten  I wouldn't be here  Deed  Deed  Deed  Show your boobs  Everyone will be happy again  I don't care  See everyone's happy again  I don't care  See we just got to be safe  And make sure you don't pull the knife  On me  I don't care  Oh  She can say whatever she wants  She's a sexy teen  Go ahead  Hold on  Deed  Deed  Deed  He's getting a little jealous  Deed's just about reached  The boiling point  Where the knife story  Is probably actually appropriate 
[01:46:30]  Oh  Wait a minute  Deed  You've got to watch  With the S and F words  Yeah  Stop  You don't care  Don't give a turn  She doesn't have a turn  Hey these guys  I think you guys are  Conceptually tolerant  Oh really  I have already  Just  Really  We're tolerant  And Danielle's got youth  On her side  She's what  19  I know  Long legs  And just  Long legs  Hot  Blonde hair  She's sticking her tongue out 
[01:47:00]  See I know for a fact  That Dee is not mad at Danielle  Right  She's just mad at the idea  Of anyone  The cliche  It just gets on my nerves  Which is upsetting  What's the cliche though  The cliche is a girl  With like a normal girl  Who is not like  Who isn't you  Who is not like me  And she goes to the canning bed  Like 10 or 12 times  Then go dice her hair blonde  And everybody thinks  She's gorgeous  Well I happen to like  Natural breasts  So I'm a big fan of hers  Wow  She do thorn 
[01:47:30]  So basically  Dee's got a problem  With every single person  You want to grab a shot  In the world  Pour Dee a shot  She's been trying to  Pour herself one  Give her a shot  Pour it all over herself  Is that whiskey on your pants  Yes  That's like the same  As like  I don't care  Pouring her that shot  Is like  Putting a five minute  Throwing call  Hey why don't you girls  Kiss to make up  Telling security  To come in five minutes  It's like pouring her  Steve-O  Can we get the girls  To kiss to make up  Her dad is here  Hello  Well just to kiss dad  Hello 
[01:48:00]  I think before any kissing  Goes on  Dee should probably  Apologize to Danielle  I told her  I was sorry  It's not my fault  It is  It's not my fault  No it's not  I'm an honest person  It's not my fault  Right  Exactly  And honestly  She gets really mad  At just about everyone  It's like  It's only after she's had  Like almost three beers  You know  It's such a bummer man  I don't like a lot  If you get a look  At my nerves  It's not my fault  There you go

[02:27:00]  Alright Steve-O this is what I'm thinking  If D does one more eight ball trick  I think we bring the whole show all the way around  And we all leave very happy  D can we leave happy?  We can leave happy everybody right?  And we'll admire her hotness  Come give me a hug and drop a pool ball  Aww yeah  Go give him a hug  And we'll all acknowledge how hot you really are  And all that other stuff was just silliness on the radio  She really just became anti-social on her own 
[02:27:30]  Like I didn't  I'm not handing over  You didn't do this?  I did not do this  I'm not handing over the eight ball until Steve-O says it's okay  Oh man  Steve  Can we  Quit what?

[02:31:30]  Wow  Alright well  Very nice  Bravo  There you go  I don't know what made the air there  Well  Well this video  And  There you go  He  I figured out what he was doing there  And he was  He was chugging the beer with  Another part of his body  Exactly  Okay  Yeah  Oh  That was impressive  That's pretty impressive there  I didn't know 
[02:32:00]  What?  What's that Steve?  I didn't know  Like what the chances are  Of reenacting that stunt  Right  But having just reenacted  Yeah  I could  I'm not a natural anymore  Really?  Like beginner's luck is no longer  Part of the thing  How did you  I am like good  How did you feel it went?  Let's see  I think that I 
[02:32:30]  Undeniably  I'm looking at the video now  Because I had a bad vantage point  Oh my god  It looked like  It looked like  A beer tap at a bar  Don't it look like  Holy Jesus  If a homeless guy  With no teeth  Was chugging a beer  Oh my god  That's pretty good  That's pretty good there  Is that about like  Drinking it  I know  Get on mic  So people can hear you  I don't think  I still haven't really  Figured out that stuff  See I understand 
[02:33:00]  Because I thought  I thought it was  About drinking  It's not about drinking  But it's drinking it  With the  Right  The  Everyone knows  Everyone knows  That part  That part  We know  We know  But you know  What the listeners  Don't know  Is that I applied  My  Clenching skills  Your clenching skills  Good  Clenching  Yeah  And the leg kicking  Leg kicking and clenching  That's where we  Imbibe  Imbibe  Look at him  Yeah  You know  Yeah  That's where  Alright 
[02:33:30]  That's gross you said  So hey man  You guys like  That was good  You guys like  I hope you had fun  You beat me up  You put my life in danger  You didn't do the  Roller crash derby  No  But once again  We had a great time  Yeah we had a great time  But it was a lot of fun  Poor listeners  And Steve-O's going to be  At Hooters right after the show  Right after they leave here  Are you guys going to join me  We'll come down  You know what dude  I think we've got a couple more beers  Let me knock them out with you  Alright  We'll come down there  Because I'd rather be  Hitting your bathroom  Than you know  The Hooters bathroom  So you know

[02:34:30]  No  No no  Butt chug's legal  I think that's what it was  It was  Yeah it was  It was  It was nothing short  Full  On that playback  I'm thinking like  Yeah  Like just that last squirt  Was like two hours  Who do I give the eight ball back to  Yeah give the eight ball back to  The shady lawyer  Yeah  And we should  We should give props  To the gangster manager  For  Yeah  Like pouring  He poured his skills  Yeah  His pouring skills 
[02:35:00]  Are really good  Although I think he was pouring  A little too fast  For your liking  Hey Steve  Is that what I saw  A lot of people want to ask  When the movie's coming out  The Jackass movie  The Jackass movie  It's tentative  August 9th  Right  And  They're not going to puss out though  Are they  The butt chug  Is Hollywood going to get a hold  Of the Jackass movie  They're going to get a hold of it  And then peace be it  Right  You're thinking  MPAA  Is going to  Just shut down everything  I think that everyone's got  Like a pretty good idea  Of like what standards are  Like in the general  Motion picture  And I think that like 
[02:35:30]  You know  It's pretty  Straightforward  You know  But I think  We've got the most  Idiotic loopholes  That just  I think  I think I'm close  To getting my ass kicked  I think  Almost everything  In the movie  Is like  Something that  They're going to probably  Have to make new laws over  But  Alright  Alright  I don't know  Well thank you D  The star of the show  Well yeah  What a great  From stevovideo.com  Great job

[02:44:30]  Oh wow  I think  Hey enough thought went into that  That guy should be the umpire  Yeah that was pretty good  That was good  But I think they dumped out  Cause I think she said F you  I said okay  All right  No no D  You actually like probably got the highest ratings these guys  Yeah you've done a great job D  And I like  She's happy about that  I like how it went  Like D worked herself up  She peeked out  At really going crazy  And throwing your eight ball  But then it went back down  And you're mellow now  That guy was good  I think he might have had a few bumps  And see 
[02:45:00]  The reality is  The reality is that  I don't care about your eight ball Frank  The reality is you did the eight ball thing better than anyone today  And you know we got to give that to her today  There you go  The pinpoint accuracy is just amazing  Yeah  See it looked easy until the other girl tried to do it  She calls her lump  Like Babe Ruth right  Right  She points to the lump  And all those brain cells had to concentrate at the same time  It's not an easy feat right  Yeah of course  Sean what's up  Hey boys  Hey  I learned that Opie's son is Anthony's daughter's unborn child's father

[02:46:30]  Yeah  We have video of Rick doing that  Yes we do  Yeah the pool needs to deal with just increments of the eight ball  Not the whole eight ball  Right  Thank you Rick  Let's hear it for our cheerleaders for stopping by today  Yes  Bravo girls  And these two  Thank you girls  I heard you all think you're so terrible  Hey  You're a terrible man Opie  What?
