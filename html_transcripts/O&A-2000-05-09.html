<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast begins with the hosts expressing disappointment over the cancellation of their "Two for Tuesday" segment.  The bulk of the early show focuses on their comatose co-worker, "Spaz," who arrived at work severely ill after consuming two drowsy Sudafed and two aspirin.  The hosts attempt to rouse him with increasingly frantic measures, capturing his incoherent ramblings on a nearby microphone.  They speculate wildly about his condition, ranging from a common cold to far more serious ailments, also commenting on his new boots and high car mileage.  Listener calls offer equally bizarre diagnoses. Spaz eventually regains some coherence, confirming his medication intake and significant discomfort.

The conversation then transitions to the previous night's "Raw's War" event, a confrontation between Opie and Anthony's listeners and other radio station crews. Psycho Mark provides details of his involvement.  The hosts discuss a photo of Hillary Clinton hugging a one-legged boy at a Cardinal's funeral, before moving on to a critique of Hillary Clinton's perceived lack of emotion compared to Rudy Giuliani's more outwardly displayed feelings at a political event. They also jokingly speculate on the future television appearances of the "one-legged kid."

The show then shifts its focus to Earl, a staff member, who is lethargic while working on distributing "WOW" stickers. The hosts playfully mock Earl's sluggishness, referring to him as "the sloth," and discuss his upcoming sticker distribution at Yankee Stadium.  A substantial portion of the broadcast plays and dissects audio from Earl's surprisingly successful Saturday night radio show. These clips feature Earl yelling at an "imaginary person" he blames for technical difficulties, a recurring joke throughout the segment.  Listener calls add anecdotes about the "WOW" sticker promotion and their opinions of Earl's performance.  The hosts also briefly discuss the Hanson brothers' comeback attempt and continue ribbing Earl.

The show continues with a discussion about Earl's radio show, where he claimed to have had a studio guest, a claim Opie denies. This leads to speculation about an invisible guest, comparing it to Tyler Durden from *Fight Club*.  Caller Peter contributes to the joke. The conversation then turns to the upcoming "Wow Day," a promotion involving women flashing those with "WOW" stickers. They detail their plans, including a guest appearance by the pilot who wrote "WOW" over Manhattan and the return of "the hot wax girl," Shannon, for an aerial wax-based performance.  Opie recounts a near-police encounter due to reckless driving. The hosts announce the syndication of their "Black Girl" segment and Earlâ€™s radio show.  They then replay a controversial prank call, "Bill's Dead," where Opie impersonated a relative at funeral homes, prompting strong reactions from the hosts and a caller who labels the prank "sick." The show concludes with a discussion of a televised segment featuring a person with intellectual disabilities on *Family Double Dare*, generating laughter and a discussion about its appropriateness, with the hosts acknowledging the lack of political correctness while still finding it humorous.  Finally, they promote a concert and a weight loss product.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.B. and Anthony, brilliant radio at its best.  Oh, God! Help us!  1-in-7-O-N-N-O-N-O-N  It's the ONA Show!  Oh, yeah.  On this fine Two for Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday, exclusively.  Two for Tuesday's ours, God damn it.  Here on NHLW.  We need our Two for Tuesday back.  I feel so bad they took it. 
[00:00:30]  We can't be a radio station without Tooper Tuesday.  How will we go on?  Tooper.  Take your Toopers and shove it up your butt.  Keep it.  Butt sex.  That's it.  Where's a good butt sex to start the show?  Here it is.  Butt sex.  Ah.  What's better than...  Butt sex.  Butt sex.  Ah. 
[00:01:00]  Okay, listen.  We've got to get some people in here, Anthony.  Yes, we do.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  Helmet rocks, by the way.  Helmut.  Helmut.  Helmut.  We've got to start the show with some Helmut.  Maybe tomorrow we'll do unsung or something.  I got a lot of flack for playing that O.A.  Komeva yesterday.  You certainly did, O.  I thought I would try something a little different.  A little different.  You know what the people want to hear.  You can't be stirring up the soup too much. 
[00:01:30]  I thought that was a goof.  All right.  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  O.A. Komeva.  All right.  Listen, you guys.  We've got a situation happening at the radio station.  It's never a boring day around here.  I've got O.A. Komeva.  Yeah, Spaz, if Erica's listening, we've been trying to get a hold of you, Erica.  We need to talk to you on the air.  Beba is in a coma, basically.  Beba is in a coma, basically.  Beba.  Erica's on her way to pick up Spaz. 
[00:02:00]  Hey, Beba.  I'm in a coma.  Spaz is out cold on the couch outside.  You taking a picture of him?  He's a mess, man.  I got into work around 1130, and Spaz, he looked absolutely horrible.  He's sick today.  So I'm like, go home, man.  You're going to get me sick.  You're going to get everyone sick.  What does he got, like a cold or something, right?  Yeah.  He was all sniffling and stuff, and he's got blisters on his feet from his brand new $200  work boots. 
[00:02:30]  The boots that he bought on his credit card.  He's giving him blisters.  So he's got blisters, and he feels like crap.  Great.  All right, so we're going about our business, trying to get the radio show together, and  a couple hours go by, and we all start looking at Spaz, and we realize that he is sleeping  with his eyes open and not talking to anyone, just in a chair.  Yeah, it didn't even look like sleep.  He looked like somebody who just OD'd on heroin right before they die, that face they made. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  That's what he looked like.  So I started singing in the office, Spazzy, can you hear me?  Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy.  Spazzy, can you hear me?  Spazzy, can you hear me?  Spazzy, can you hear me?  He's completely out of it.  So then we had to scream.  I'm like, Spaz, what is wrong?  I just started screaming, the famous, you know, Opie scream.  Right.  To wake him up.  I'm like, Spaz, what is wrong? 
[00:03:30]  Look at you.  What?  What?  What?  What?  At one point, he rolled over to his little area and put his head down on the desk and just  was laying there.  Like, effed up.  Yeah.  You might be hearing a mic in the other room right now.  Well, because we're going to try to wake Spaz up.  Tommy, can you hear me?  Whoa!  Whoa!  Can you feel me near you?  Hey, hey, who's Spazzy? 
[00:04:00]  Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy. 
[00:04:30]  Tommy, can you hear me?  What?  Can you feel me near you?  Enuses.  Tommy, can you see me?  Let me know.  Let me know.  Come on.  Can I help you hear you?  Oh, Spazzy, Spazzy, Spazzy.  Whoa!  Tommy, whoa!  Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.  Hey, Spazzy, Spazzy. 
[00:05:00]  Be quiet, sir.  All right.  So, he's really, really out of it, and Eric is on the way to pick up Spazzy.  Spazzy, can you hear me?  Yeah.  Erica, please call the radio show.  This is kind of serious.  So, we woke him up enough to get two words out of him.  Mm-hmm.  Took Sudafed.  Took.  He didn't even, he didn't even, he didn't even make a sentence.  He just went, took, took Sudafed.  Took Sudafed.  Woo!  So, I scream at him, like, Spaz, where, where are the pills? 
[00:05:30]  I gotta, I gotta.  Like, it's a guy that OD'd.  Yeah.  So, he's incoherent, right?  He's completely out of it.  He's so gone.  He took two Sudafed.  Right.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  So, wait, wait, wait.  So, so, it turns out, it's like, first of all, it's not the non-drowsy Sudafed.  No, no.  He took the drowsy one.  And Spaz is drowsy in life.  Right.  Picture him with a Sudafed.  One will just knock you out on a day like today.  Yeah.  He threw two in his body.  Two Sudafeds.  So, he is, uh. 
[00:06:00]  He is completely out.  Out cold on the couch.  Down for the couch.  Now, who's got the portable mic?  All right.  Well, get, who wants, you want to go out there, or you want to get cycle marked?  I don't know.  I'm not close enough with, uh.  Get cycle marked.  Get cycle marked.  Get cycle marked.  I'll effing harass the hell out of him.  So, I mean.  You heard the whisper.  Wait, that was him.  Huh?  You got, you mic'd him?  Right on him.  You mic'd him?  I got a mic like an inch from his mouth. 
[00:06:30]  Cool.  That's who was talking to him.  He just mumbled.  It's him.  He's mumbling.  He's mumbling incoherently.  Just keep the mic on.  He's like.  He's out cold on the couch.  He's drooling on himself.  And he cannot, he cannot keep his eyes.  Oh, so much.  Whoever.  You guys take some pictures?  I got a couple pictures of him.  Get a pic with the mic right there.  I do.  I have a couple.  So, he's, he's so effed up.  He can't even talk.  He's like.  You guys keep.  When you guys do all the stuff.  I hear you.  He's mumbling. 
[00:07:00]  Like, he can hear you guys.  Like.  I think he said.  Oh, oh.  Talk some spaz.  Spaz?  Spaz?  Spaz?  Spaz?  Spaz, can you hear us?  Stop.  Spaz?  What are you crying?  Spazzy?  Spazzy?  Spazzy, can you hear me?  Spazzy, can you hear me?  No.  What?  Mom?  Huh? 
[00:07:30]  Spazzy, can you hear me?  Is mommy molesting you?  Spaz?  Stop.  I just can't.  Kevin?  Kevin?  I'm sick and you just leave me alone.  Oh, my God.  You're whining like you're in the back of a cop car.  Ben.  Kevin?  Kevin, how many Sudafed did you take, Kevin?  Two.  Two Sudafed.  Oh, he can hear us now. 
[00:08:00]  Are you awake, Kev?  I'm a bit awake.  Have you ever taken Sudafed before?  When I was a kid.  When you were a kid.  And, and, you know, uh, you should probably take one to see how it hits you.  Bill, let me throw it.  All right, all right.  Spaz is cursing.  You can't curse, Spaz.  Spaz, you're on the air.  Spaz.  Spaz, we're at a dump.  You curse one more time, you're really going to cause some problems here.  You're really going to be sick.  Yeah.  All right, so what is wrong with you? 
[00:08:30]  What happened?  You were fine yesterday.  I've been sneezing for the past few days, and everything just caught up on me.  So you decided to take two, two Sudafed?  Two.  And two Aspirin.  And two Aspirin.  Two.  Anything else you throw into that body of yours?  Any heroin?  No.  You smoke a dupe with Psycho Mark?  No.  I'm hearing, I'm also hearing that it hurts when you take a leak.  Is that true?  Yeah, it does.  Uh-oh. 
[00:09:00]  It hurts when you take a leak?  It's because I can't feel anything.  What do you mean you can't feel anything?  I can't feel my muscles.  Oh, my God.  You can't?  What did you, is anybody selling this stuff on the streets?  Because it sounds great.  Where, where's Erica?  Why isn't she calling in?  Huh?  Skip the mic away.  Erica's on her way.  I just want to go home.  Well, all right.  We're just making sure you're okay. 
[00:09:30]  We had to wake you up.  You were comatose on that couch.  I was awake, though, all the time.  No, you weren't.  Do you know all the pictures we took of you?  I saw flashes.  You saw flashes?  Did you see the fake penis next to your mouth?  No.  I didn't know what it was.  I guess you weren't awake, then.  Dude.  What happened?  It doesn't sound like somebody with a cold.  I have a cold.  Why don't you go to the doctor?  I have no benefits.  You have no benefits.  It's fast. 
[00:10:00]  You want us to get the stinky bat to wake you up?  I am awake.  I just can't move, okay?  I can't move, but it hurts.  If you get a whiff of the wiffle ball bat from last week's show, you'll be wide awake.  Look, if you want me to work, I'll just set up the phone so I can't get up.  Oh, yeah.  That's what we want our listeners to have to contend with when they're calling in.  Hello.  It's fast.  What do you want to talk about?  I guess I might get away from you.  How are the blisters on your feet? 
[00:10:30]  They're horrible.  You are a mess.  Hey, I heard you guys had fun at wrestling last night, huh?  Not that much fun.  You drove the van?  I didn't drive the van.  No?  Mark drove the van.  Mark drove the van?  And what, was he scaring you?  No, I wasn't in the van.  Oh.  Well, Spaz, why do you have blisters on your feet?  Let's get back to that.  Because of my new boots. 
[00:11:00]  The $200.  Your $200 boots?  Yeah.  And are the blisters big?  As soon as one pops, another one forms right over it.  Are you sitting up?  We can't see him.  I mean, there's a mic outside the studio that we're listening to.  Are you sitting up, Spaz?  No.  No?  Would you like to talk to the lovely Erica?  She will not call the show, I guess, until you say it's okay or something. 
[00:11:30]  If she wants to.  Yeah.  Erica, why don't you give us a call real fast?  Yeah.  I would think.  I would think.  I think you need to talk to him.  Spaz, you're stupid to take two Sudafed.  Yeah.  I need something, okay?  Well, now this looks, it seems to be worse than the cold you were trying to get rid of.  You're like a drug addict or something.  I feel like crap.  Well, you look like crap.  And it hit you that fast?  Yeah.  He was sitting in the office.  He wasn't moving. 
[00:12:00]  His eyes were open, but he wasn't home, man.  It's just been a long time coming.  It's just been building up and it just hit today.  Wait, wait, is it the sick or the Sudafed?  The sick, it's been leading up, so I take the Sudafed and now I feel like this.  Yeah, the Sudafed has just knocked him completely for a loop here, Anthony.  FBA.  Is it the, is it the, is the long commute getting to you already?  No.  No?  Someone said he could be getting that equine encephalitis from the giant mosquito. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, maybe you have that.  Yeah, maybe it's, it's not blisters on your, on your feet.  Maybe you got stung by a mosquito or something.  Hey, that new place that you have in Sloatsburg isn't underneath any cancerous live wires, is it?  No.  Okay, just, just checking.  I'm going to make sure our spaz is okay.  Anything else, Spaz?  No.  How are we going to get you downstairs?  I'll limp.  You're going to limp?  Can you even stand up?  I don't know, I haven't tried in the last hour. 
[00:13:00]  Why don't you try standing up?  Yeah, give it a whirl.  Can you get the microphone out of my face so I can get up?  Okay, is he up?  He's moving.  Some people checking in with their diagnosis.  Maybe he has a urinary tract infection.  Does he have a fever?  Spaz, do you feel like you have a fever?  I don't know.  You don't know or no?  I can't understand.  My head is pounding. 
[00:13:30]  Your head's pounding?  Does it really sting when you take a leak?  At first.  It burns?  At first.  At first.  Burning when he takes a leak.  Blisters.  Blisters on his body.  On his feet.  And he's comatose.  And he's in a coma.  My throat hurts.  His throat hurts bad.  Do you have anything?  Did anyone look down your throat?  No.  Do you have any kind of like white marks in there, like a strep throat or something? 
[00:14:00]  I have no clue.  Yeah, well, we know that.  You want to drink some toilet water?  No.  Make you feel better?  No?  City pool water?  Spaz, why would you come to work feeling like this?  Yeah.  We appreciate the dedication to the radio show, but this is a little out there, don't you think?  We have Stinky.  We'll be fine.  Yeah, Stinky will step right in once again.  And no more sick days for another couple months.  Well, why did you use all your sick days up?  Because you didn't think he was going to get sick.  He's such an idiot, man. 
[00:14:30]  Look, everyone is just shaking their head, like, every day it's something different.  Look at Sam from upstairs.  People think we just write this stuff every day.  We sit in the office and like, okay, what can we have Spaz do today?  His life is a drama.  Well, Spaz, you obviously have to go home and get better.  Oh, wait, wait.  Spaz is going to get up?  Okay.  Well, we got a mic on him. 
[00:15:00]  Spaz?  Spaz, when you go home, I got to tell you,  this is another great opportunity for Stinky.  Yeah.  I don't care.  I'm sick.  We certainly are.  Oh, my God.  And we can't get Erica on the phone.  I think she's going to be pissed at us that we put you on the air in this state.  I'm trying to figure out if he's like this because he's sick or from the medication.  Oh, you didn't see him earlier. 
[00:15:30]  He looked horrible when we first saw him this morning,  and then he took the Sudafed and it made it worse because he took two instead of one.  Well, Spaz, perhaps instead of going to Sloatsburg and maybe checking in with Doc Baker,  maybe you should go to a doctor, a real doctor, and see if there's something wrong with you.  I don't know if he'll turn shit up yet.  Oh, good, good.  So if you're dead, at least you won't have to worry about paying any bills.  You know what I mean, Spaz? 
[00:16:00]  I got no money.  Well, people with no money go to the doctor all the time.  In this country, there are laws that they have to treat you.  Yes.  Regardless of your financial status.  Stinky, take that mic.  Stinky, are you ready to step up for Spaz once again today?  Right away.  Right away, right?  All right.  Are you willing to fulfill the obligation as Vice Spaz to come forward and take the office of Spaz? 
[00:16:30]  Someone is saying that Spaz was wasted at wrestling last night.  Uh-oh.  Were you drinking last night?  Be honest.  We'll get people that'll tell us.  I swear to the Lord, I was not drinking.  You didn't have anything to drink?  Were you smoking dope?  No, I never touched the stuff.  No?  You had no beer?  Why is someone yelling liar in the background, Spaz?  I experimented once.  You what?  Experimented once.  With what, pot?  Once.  Once?  All right.  Girl. 
[00:17:00]  Well, your lovely girlfriend should be here.  Where's Joe's Garage?  Do we have Frank Zapp as Joe's Garage?  Why?  There's a song I want to play for Spaz on there.  See if you can find that.  Spaz, we might as well cheer him up maybe with a little music.  You know?  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.  What's on for?  Let me see.  Let me see the CD.  This is our worst.  It probably isn't on there then.  Come on.  We're the largest rock and roll library.  We don't have Joe's Garage.  Part one. 
[00:17:30]  I think we gave it away when we were turning to talk.  God damn it.  I sold it.  Spaz, you think Eric is going to be pissed that we're talking to you on the air?  I don't know.  Because we begged her to call in and she hasn't yet.  Because her cell phone has got no minutes left.  The cell phone has no minutes left?  Are you kidding?  Why?  It's prepaid.  And you used all your minutes?  Yeah.  Hey, Spaz, I heard you leased a car.  Eric leases a car.  Oh, yeah?  And how many miles do you get a year on the lease? 
[00:18:00]  15,000.  And how long have you had the car?  Less than a year.  Like six and a half months?  Yeah.  How many miles do you have on the car?  Close to 30.  Oh, my God.  Do you know how much they pound you for miles?  That's where they make their real money on the lease.  You have close to 30,000 miles in a little over a half a year?  What's the going rate for mileage on cars?  15 cents a mile.  So let's do some quick mathematics.  He's already like, what did you say, 26? 
[00:18:30]  Two and a half years left.  26, you said, Spaz?  He said 28,000 miles already.  Yeah, so he's well over 1,500 in the hole.  So already.  About 2,500.  About 2,500, 2,800.  About 2,500, 2,800 dollars already in mileage.  And he's still got two and a half years to go on the lease.  4,500.  If it keeps going this way, let's see.  It would average out to over 4,000 for the year.  1,000 for the year.  Extra mileage to eat anything today, so it's kind of easy.  Spaz, a lot of people think you might have VD. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  No.  Huh?  No.  No?  I wanted to play Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?  From Frank Zappa.  Why does it hurt when I pee?  I love Zappa.  It jumped right off and grabbed my meat.  I got it from the toilet seat.  My balls feel like a pair of maracas. 
[00:19:30]  You all right?  Spaz, someone thinks you might have ovarian cancer.  I don't have ovaries.  That's right.  You don't have ovaries.  We taught you that, remember?  Spaz, you may have toxic shock syndrome from the tampon.  I don't know what I have.  Oh.  All right.  Well, we were stalling, hoping that your lovely girlfriend would call in, but it doesn't look  like she wants any part of this.  Blisters on feet, sore throat, lives in Sloatsburg. 
[00:20:00]  Jim from Jersey says you have hoof and mouth disease.  What the hell is that?  I don't know, but Sloatsburg, have you been sticking your feet somewhere that they don't  belong?  No.  No?  His boots hurt.  Listen to him whine.  All right.  Well, Spaz.  It's sickle cell anemia.  Sickle cell.  You got sickle cell, Spaz.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I need a blood test.  You need a blood test. 
[00:20:30]  I think you just...  Oh, listen to him.  I know.  He's going to get us all sick.  You got Legionnaires disease, man.  Don't breathe.  Spaz, you got to go to the doctor.  You might have some kind of a urinary tract infection or something.  Oh, no.  Take his temperature.  Someone get a thermometer and take his temperature.  Spaz, why don't you go in the bathroom and, you know, relieve yourself?  Oh, my God.  We want to see if it still stinks.  We're going to diagnose you here today. 
[00:21:00]  It's nothing in my bladder.  You sure?  You can't make it happen?  No.  Make believe it's a drug test or something?  I need water.  You need water?  Someone's saying somebody painted Save Spaz on the Slotesburg water tower.  Like Ferris Bueller.  Are you sure?  Yeah, don't give him toilet water.  He was, Kelly, I was sitting next to Spaz at Raw.  He was fine. 
[00:21:30]  He must have done something hardcore.  And somebody else writing, God damn it, I bought him a beer.  I didn't drink it.  Maybe you have the love virus.  That's computer virus.  Oh.  Somehow I still got it, bro.  All right, Spaz, why don't you lay back down on the couch?  Thank you.  All right.  John saying he might have caught gonorrhea from the girl he cheated on Erica with.  Now he can write in his calendar, March 6th, got the clap. 
[00:22:00]  So you're a little worried about your wee-wee, aren't you?  No.  Is there anything happening with your wee-wee?  Yeah.  I've been tested.  It's clean.  No, I mean, it burns when you leak, but is there anything happening?  It always happens when I get sick.  Are you ovulating?  No.  Be serious. 
[00:22:30]  Case Nile virus?  Could be.  No.  You didn't now get bit my mosquito, did you?  No.  No?  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Anthony, but...  Spaz is very sick today.  Mad cow disease?  Did you eat any beef?  I eat a lot of meat.  Lupus?  Everybody's just coming up with things he has.  I'm going to guess mad cow's disease.  Do you have the Hunter virus?  Were you near any rodents, rodent feces, or hunters? 
[00:23:00]  Well, you know what I have after I get tested.  I think he's got the Hunter virus.  Yeah, people are just screaming, quarantine, quarantine, quarantine, spaz.  Quarantine, yep.  You woke up and just felt like crap.  You woke up and just felt like crap.  You never did that.  What?  Woke up and felt like crap?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Butt sex.  Maybe.  Butt sex.  That's not what I'm talking about.  A lot of people are trying to figure out what's wrong with you, spaz.  I'll test the show.  One of the Yankee bleacher creatures.  This is the same kind of stunt he used to pull at Iona.  Anything for attention.  Spaz, do you have the swine flu?  What's the swine flu?  I don't know.  It's a flu.  It's a flu that you get from pigs.  Oh.  Maybe you have a yeast infection. 
[00:24:00]  A yeast infection?  No.  It's only where we get those.  People checking in, this is totally impossible.  No one can be this pathetic.  Spaz, you got anthrax.  How's your prostate?  I never missed a day of school.  I never got really that sick before.  Spaz, do you have Lou Gehrig's disease?  Do your muscles ache?  Bob from Jersey.  More coherency came out of the mouth of a person who did a bottle of Jack and a handful of Luz. 
[00:24:30]  Spaz, do you have the bubonic plague?  I have no clue what you're talking about.  Do you have the Ebola virus, Spaz?  Where's my Ebola?  Where's the Ebola thing, man?  Get the Ebola thing.  We got all the symptoms of Ebola.  It's on card over there.  Spaz, are you faking cancer to help the mess? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, man.  The Mets have been in a little, uh, loop.  Let me go home.  The Mets have been losing lately.  Are you faking cancer?  I used to try to turn them around a bit.  Spaz, Mike from Long Island checking in.  The stinging may come from spanking it in the shower with liquid hand soap.  Oh.  Sometimes, I think every guy has had that problem.  Spaz, you don't bother us when we're sick because we don't come in.  I'm pissed because you're going to get us all sick. 
[00:25:30]  I'm like the boy in the plastic bubble.  I can't be around sick people.  My sick days haven't been reset yet.  Spaz, do you have cranky ass?  What is that?  I guess not.  Could be meningitis.  You need to pass a stone?  No, but it runs in the family.  Ah.  Daniel, I want to know if you've had a breast exam lately.  No. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Well, we got the commercial for Ebola virus.  See if it is.  See if you have any of these symptoms, Spaz, okay?  Do you have a stuffy nose?  A scratchy throat?  And a cough that just won't sweat?  Ebola!  Pulse of diarrhea?  Ebola!  Blood oozing from every orphan? 
[00:26:30]  Black virus spewing out of your mouth and nose?  Ebola!  Ebola!  The itching, scratching, sniffling, sneezing, coughing, crapping, puking, bleeding, so you can die virus.  Anything like that, Spaz?  Not even close.  Not even close?  All right, we're just checking.  We're trying to be doctors here.  Fitz wants to know if you're laying there counting your ribs. 
[00:27:00]  Of course, from the FBA song.  Are you counting your ribs, Spaz?  So skinny and curly.  Spaz, you may have encephalitis.  Do you have any allergies, Spaz?  You could be allergic to pseudofed, you know.  I'm allergic to bees.  Bees.  You haven't been stung by a bee, have you?  If I was, my head would be twice the size it is.  Wow, that's got to be something to say.  We'll put a little cardinal hat on you.  Spaz, you want us to get you a gynecologist? 
[00:27:30]  Just put a break.  Did you eat any of those Alestra chips?  Those could do that.  Burger from New Rochelle said King Gimp had the same symptoms.  Eric from Massapequa is saying, don't let Spaz go home.  He'll infect all 50 trains he takes.  Spaz, you may have Captain Trips.  Have you been dreaming about a fat black woman in Nebraska? 
[00:28:00]  Or a devil guy out in Las Vegas?  The stand, right?  Very good.  Very good.  Is your neck blowing up?  Like a tire tube?  It hurts.  Would you like to take a leak?  No.  You sure?  Positive.  All right.  All right, I guess we'll just have to wait for Erica.  Is she going to come upstairs to get you? 
[00:28:30]  That's her prerogative.  Her prerogative?  If Erica's listening, please come upstairs, because she can't call us, because they ran  out of minutes on their cell phone.  Who are they calling?  Do you know how many minutes you get these days on phones?  They're so competitive now that all the phone companies are giving away service.  Who are you two calling so much on your cell phone?  We're getting things ready for the new apartment.  Phone company, cable, everything. 
[00:29:00]  How many minutes do you get?  We keep buying 50 at a time.  50 at a time?  We buy 50 at a time.  Maybe you should get a little more than 50?  Yeah.  Did a rat bite you in your new apartment?  Mice-free, roach-free.  Yeah, right.  Where cockroaches nibbling on your wiener?  All right, Spaz.  We'll let you go, I guess.  Thank you. 
[00:29:30]  Maybe Regis Philman knows what you have.  Got it.  Joe from Jersey writes, the problem with Spaz is reality.  My diagnosis is that his first credit card bill came in the mail today.  Yeah.  Thank you, man.  He got a touch of the reality, it's called.  The reality bug.  I don't get mail yet.  What?  I don't get mail yet.  Hey, Mike's a big Spaz fan.  He hopes you feel better.  Mike, what's up?  Mike, hey.  Mike.  I think he hung up. 
[00:30:00]  All right, now.  We should take our first.  Hey, Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Here we go with the phone.  Whatever your name is.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah.  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  Speak.  We got you on the air.  All right.  Let me get into it.  Hi, my name is Mike, and I'm a Spazaholic.  But you know what?  Listen to this little crybaby one.  You know what?  Replace him.  I'm a stinkaholic now.  Yeah, you're into the stinkmeister?  Stinky.  Stinky rules, and Raw was awesome yesterday.  Yeah, Stinky's going to have to step up once again for Spaz. 
[00:30:30]  1A.  You guys are gods.  All right, thanks.  Syndication, whatever.  Later.  Thank you.  Hey, can we get Stinky real fast before we go to break?  Hey, Spaz, so you're on the couch.  Erica should get you soon, okay?  Okay.  I want to talk to my new friend, Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Tell everyone what we're all doing after the show tonight.  We're all going rollerblading.  Yeah, how about this?  Everybody, Opie, rollerblades.  Rick, we're starting our skate club.  You're going.  Psycho Mark. 
[00:31:00]  We're going inline skating.  Stinky, you guys are all heading, I guess, to the park.  Yeah, we'll go to the park tonight.  And you're going to go blading.  Right.  Now, Spaz, Spaz, I'm going inline skating with Stinky and the guys after the show tonight.  Have fun.  Put him over the edge.  Huh?  Have fun.  Have fun.  We will.  We're going to bond a little bit.  Stinky's becoming quite a member of the crew, I got to tell you.  Well, he knows how to hang.  It's pretty cool.  After work, everybody hangs in the office.  Stinky's right there, butt in hand, just hanging out, shooting the crap, you know? 
[00:31:30]  Well, Spaz would hang, but if he hung after the show, he wouldn't get home until, like,  2 in the morning.  All right, Spaz.  Spaz, Fred checking in from Jersey.  Maybe you have botulism.  Did you get any bad beating in the can?  No.  A lot of people.  That's it.  Yes.  Spaz, a lot of people are thinking that you're just hung over.  That's what a lot of people are saying.  I didn't think last night, though.  All right.  I drank very early this morning. 
[00:32:00]  All right, well, Spaz, take care of yourself.  We're not going to say goodbye to you.  We're going to lock the studio door.  We're going to be the boys in the plastic bubble today.  Yeah.  We don't want to get sick.  We don't want to get what you have.  Okay.  Hopefully, Erica will come upstairs to help you get down to the car, because you're going  to need the help.  I'd like to see him at least by the glass door when he leaves, so we could, like, see  him like the boy in the plastic bubble.  Yeah, Spaz, we'll put him in this studio here.  Spaz, can you wait in this studio so we can watch you?  Spaz, walk up to the door. 
[00:32:30]  We want to make sure you're okay.  Yeah, let me see his face.  Linda's saying Spaz has a urinary tract infection, without a doubt.  I've heard he's got an inflamed uterus.  Is he okay?  He's huffing, wheezing, puffing.  There's a lot of people looking at him.  Rick says he's faking it.  Oh, my God.  Look, he's pissed.  He's pissed.  Everyone's pissed about us making bits about their real life.  He's standing there laughing, taking pictures, and thinking it's all funny.  Well, you shouldn't have came to work. 
[00:33:00]  How did you come in, dude?  Mike is saying he was drinking with you last night.  Is that true or not?  Drinking.  You didn't have one beer.  Not one beer.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, both Psycho Mark and Spaz were wasted last night.  I gave Spaz a sign that said to dildodepot.com, and he actually started to put it on the side of the van.  You took it out of my hands and you put it next to the tire.  All right, so you're saying that Spaz was drunk last night. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, and Psycho Mark started screaming at people walking by as well.  All right.  Well, Psycho Mark does that when he's sober.  Well, yeah, true.  All right, Mike, thank you.  You're welcome.  Are we going to see Spaz before he leaves?  Is he coming to the door?  Spaz, we just want to make sure you're okay.  No, no.  Look into the studio.  Look into the studio.  Yeah, come here.  I want to see you in the glass and make sure you're okay.  I haven't even seen your face.  Spaz, look into the studio.  No, close the door because I don't want to get infected.  Yeah, we don't need germs. 
[00:34:00]  All right, he's walking to the door.  Lean over.  Look in.  Oh, my God.  I can't see him.  Tell him to go.  Wait, Spaz, you have to come over toward it.  Let's see Anthony a little bit.  I got to see how you look.  To the side.  How are you doing, Spaz?  He looks completely covatial.  Look up, man.  Look up.  How are you doing?  Your eyes are all puffy and shut.  He looks horrible.  He can't even open his eyes.  He's hunched over like an old man.  All right, Ant.  Look, he's all pissed. 
[00:34:30]  Well, he came to work.  Listen, I can't put it up.  My blisters hurt.  You can't put what up?  My feet.  He can't put his feet up.  Well, we got a doctor checking in.  Sounds like Spaz is pregnant.  You aren't pregnant, are you?  No, but it possibly could happen.  Stay tuned for the next week in review for him to explain that one.  Are you going to explain how guys get pregnant on your next week in review? 
[00:35:00]  You know, if you would like me to.  The male seahorse carries the...  Spaz, did he eat bad seafood?  No.  Did he have a bad clam?  No.  A bad oyster?  You haven't been selling off your organs to pay off a credit card bill, have you?  Someone thinking maybe you're selling off some things that you need.  No, a kidney or anything?  No.  No?  All right.  All right, we're going to take a quick break, Spaz, and hopefully Erica will be here to get you out of this building, okay? 
[00:35:30]  I hope so, too.  Black lung disease.  All right.  You haven't worked in a mine, have you, Spaz?  No.  Okay.  Diagnosis is coming in like crazy.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  4-2-3-1.  Boop-boop-boop.  Or stupidity on the way.  Rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr. 
[00:36:00]  1-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  The late, great Mickey J.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Great news for Mets fans.  Ricky Henderson.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Goodbye.  Mets put him on waivers today.  Good riddance.  Waving goodbye.  Take luck.  Take luck.  Take luck, Ricky.  You, too.  You, too. 
[00:36:30]  You, too, Ricky.  Mets don't need that piece of crap anymore.  Is Spaz happy about that?  Ah, enough.  It's cursed.  Enough of the Spaz.  Yeah, we're done with Spaz.  He's going home.  Well, I want to say hi to everyone that was at the Coliseum last night for Raw's war.  Rawr.  Rawr.  Huge display of wow signs all over TV.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Where's, uh, the general?  Psycho Mark, the general. 
[00:37:00]  I guess he was organizing some troops outside the Coliseum last night, Anthony.  Yeah.  It almost got ugly.  Here comes the general into the studio.  Go stepping.  Keith, slide over.  Get over there, Psycho Mark.  So, Psycho Mark was, uh, was at the, uh, was at the Coliseum yesterday for Rawr's war?  Yeah.  At the battle line.  Got to say hi to all the guys that showed up to the van yesterday, and I heard there  was a lot of supporters out there. 
[00:37:30]  Tons.  A lot of fun to be had by everyone.  Tons of fun.  And I heard you were organizing the troops.  I was reading email.  That was hilarious.  I had to pull them away from the other station's vans.  It is getting...  They're chomping at the bit.  It's getting scary.  It's to the point where if Psycho Mark says something, it's all over.  Yeah.  Dude, it...  You have too much power in your van.  And the other stations, no.  They absolutely not.  Well, they don't realize it.  There was one station there, uh...  Why don't you tell the whole story?  I don't care.  Yeah.  Use call letters.  We don't really care. 
[00:38:00]  We showed up.  On this radio show.  And, uh, BAB was there, and BLI was there, and they both had their vans, and I pulled up  and just slammed the brakes and rubbed the engine right towards them.  I was like, ah, I'm coming to get you.  And I pulled up right behind the both of them.  And, uh, the BLI guy's up on top of the van.  He's doing some wacky radio bits out there in front of the Coliseum.  Hey, how we doing, everybody?  Hello, Coliseum.  Hey.  Wacky radio people.  I just jumped out and gave him a .50 caliber for about 30 seconds. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  More than his loudspeakers could ever be.  Everyone's just laughing.  Jumped back in my van.  Like, oh, whoa, that was really cool.  Ho, ho, it's another wacky radio band, you know?  Yeah.  Just idiots absolutely making fools of themselves.  So, uh, within two seconds, everyone came right over to our van and ignored them.  I heard we had a huge crowd around the WOW van, the WOW stickers being handed out, like crazy.  Now, so what happens after the Raw's War event at the Coliseum, where all you had to say was one word and a van was going to be tipped over? 
[00:39:00]  Dude, this is great, man.  It was pandemonium.  Actually, everyone's out of there, and there's thousands of people milling about.  We've got probably 200 to 300 people surrounding the NAW van.  And the geniuses, and I mean geniuses from BLI, and I know who they are.  Decide, well, let's taunt the guys from NAW.  Well, this will be a gag.  They go up on top of their vans with their speakers, and they start playing some stupid disco music and start trying to taunt us. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Well, within about 3.2 seconds.  You don't want to taunt us or our listeners.  Oh, no, no.  A little warning to every station that listens to us every day.  Do not taunt us or our listeners.  You ever see the scene in The Godfather where they're trying to tell that producer guy?  To, like, play ball.  Yeah.  With the mob.  Sure.  And he goes, I don't care how many of you guinea greaseball dago wop bastards come out of the woodwork. 
[00:40:00]  And you're just sitting there at home going, oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no.  You shouldn't say that.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, bad, bad.  That's not good.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That was exactly the same.  So they decide to get on their van after the event and start taunting.  And one guy screams, let's get him!  And the whole crowd, it would just look like L.A.  I heard it was like a...  L.A. and Somalia combined.  I heard the BLI van was like a little piece of cheese in the park with just a ton of ants all over it. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  The two guys on top of the van turned white.  The thing's shaking back in the voice.  They start shaking the van, the guys on top.  And all Mark had to say was, like, you know, go for it or whatever.  And they would have tipped the damn thing right over.  I tipped it, burned it, and had a barbecue on top of that stinking van in about a half a second if I gave the orders to do so.  Yeah.  So then you felt pretty good about yourself because you were able to say, look, guys, no, that's okay.  Calm down.  Well, I literally ran over and started peeling guys off the van. 
[00:41:00]  I'm like, guys, please, let's not destroy their van.  Yeah, if we're going to go to war, it's got to be something really good.  It's going to be worth it.  They really have to.  Not a wimpy disco station from Long Island.  No.  That, you know.  Well, needless to say, their van was covered with probably 150 seconds.  They spent the next 30 minutes peeling them off.  I'm like, see what happens when you left with us?  What an idiot.  Idiots.  See, we're real here.  I mean, they're going to go on top of the van and taunt and act like a DJ all of a sudden. 
[00:41:30]  We'll get them.  We'll get them.  Here we go.  We're going to get them.  We're going to taunt them.  They're trying to do stuff with the crowd beforehand, you know, like, you know,  well, guess this trivia question for Britney Spears seconds.  Whoa-ho!  You know?  Yeah.  Well, very good job.  General Psycho Mark, everyone.  Say hi to all the guys that came up to the van last night.  You all know who you are.  You guys are completely out of your minds.  I've never seen so many drunk fools in my life.  I heard there was an O&H in at Raw.  Is that true?  Here we go.  Matt, what's going on?  Hello?  You're on the air, Matt.  Let's go. 
[00:42:00]  What's up?  Matt, turn the radio down, Matt.  What's up?  All right.  What do you got for the show, man?  You call.  What do we got for you?  Yeah.  Yo, we were there last night at the Coliseum.  We hung out with Psycho Mark before.  Tell Psycho Mark to Syossic.  Tell Psycho Mark to Syossic, kid.  Don't remember exactly who we are.  All right.  He heard you, man.  We chilled with him.  Yeah.  And then after we came outside, I started an O&H in.  We got everybody riled up.  That's what everybody wanted.  They tipped the van. 
[00:42:30]  We were going nutty.  It was ridiculous.  You don't even know.  We were going crazy.  These guys from Syossic were completely out of there, man.  Right on, man.  Well, thank you, Matt.  All right.  All right.  Peace, Matt.  All right.  No doubt.  Later.  The Syossic, what, boys?  They call themselves.  Okay, brother.  Okay.  Lou, what's going on?  How are you, Lou?  Listen, they had the classic sign.  I think Dice was there.  They had a sign that said, I'm over here, farmer.  Oh, I saw that.  Live on TV.  I'm over here now. 
[00:43:00]  And then when they went to the wide angle, they had toss a salad.  Yeah, there were so many signs that were associated with that radio show on Raw's War last night.  You guys are great, man.  Thank you, Lou.  Syndication on the ground.  All right.  They confiscated a bunch of signs, as a matter of fact.  A lot of people get their signs confiscated.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Uh, John, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  How are you?  Pretty good, man.  They tried to take my sign last night.  Why?  I had to show me your meet curtain sign. 
[00:43:30]  I had to try to take my sign, so I'm pulling on my sign down on the ringside, and we're fighting for my sign.  I finally start beating the head with my sign, and I take off.  I go running upstairs, and then we got all those girls who start wowing.  Oh, very cool.  Yeah, we were over there with the yellow brigade.  Everybody's wearing your shirt over there.  Vagina.  Then we chased Spaz out of his seat.  Oh, really?  Spaz went, oh, yeah.  Spaz would have moved to begin with, and then we're like, yo, come on.  Let's go, Spaz.  Let's go.  So he's like, no, I'm not going anywhere. 
[00:44:00]  So then, all right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Ah, you're great.  All right.  And we chased him out of his seat, bring him outside, and just, yo, man, it was crazy, dude.  Cool.  I'm glad you had a good time.  Oh, it was crazy, man.  It was great.  We had the wow going inside there.  Right.  We had the chance going.  All right.  Everybody, man, a lot.  All right, cool, man.  All right, dude.  Thank you, John.  No problem.  Be good, guys.  You too, man.  All right.  So it seems like it was a huge success yesterday.  John's saying, Mark sounds different.  Is he sober?  I lost a little bit of my voice last night screaming. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, because you do scream really loud.  You're not going to start.  I don't feel good.  I want to go home.  Hey, baby.  Baby, pick me up, baby.  Yeah, baby will be here soon, Spaz.  Where's?  Where's, baby?  Oh, no, Spaz is baby.  I can't see you, baby.  It's getting cold, baby.  Come, precious.  Where are you, precious?  Easy. 
[00:45:00]  Easy.  Hey, come on.  Easy.  It's funny.  All right, let's regroup.  All right.  Let's clear the phone lines and get something else going on here today, okay?  Did anyone else see the big yellow Precious Loves Nana sign on Raw?  I did see that.  Precious Loves Nana.  There was also another one.  I'm over here now, precious. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  There's a bunch of precious signs.  I just didn't feel like bringing that up today.  Picking up the ball and running with it.  Yeah, we appreciate that.  That's funny.  So, oh, about that precious break yesterday?  Yeah.  So my mom, she doesn't really listen to the show a lot.  Good thing.  Just not her type of thing, you know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  So I'm home last night, and the phone rings, and it's my mom.  She goes, heard your show today.  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, I stopped breathing.  I'm like, oh, you did?  What did you hear today? 
[00:46:00]  I heard you talking about your sunburn at Grandma's house.  I'm like, oh, thank God.  But that was deathly close to another break.  That was the break right before the precious break.  Yeah.  So I quickly call up my brother, because I guess my brother was driving around.  And he goes, dude, I can tell it was starting to get ugly, and I went to my Jimmy Buffett  tape.  So my brother, who's listening right now, you shaved my ass.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  Wow.  So, all right, let's take a break.  You want to give out some tickets to see Dope, Anthony?  Dope. 
[00:46:30]  This band Dope is really, really cool.  We play them every once in a while on the show when we take music breaks and stuff.  They have like kind of a, I don't know, like a Marilyn Manson zombie thing happening.  They're their own band, but they're, you know, if I had to describe it, I would use like a  little Marilyn Manson, little zombie in there.  Definitely.  But they're definitely doing their own thing.  This band Dope is playing the Bowery Ballroom, May 31st.  If you want to check out the show, we got a pair of tickets to the 10th caller at 212-757-1027. 
[00:47:00]  You guys have superior ratings.  It's beyond belief right now.  Please.  I'll be in the end of the show.  Thank you.  1027-WNEW.  Uh, Anthony.  Yes?  This just in from Marco from Long Island.  I fooled around with Psycho Mark in the back of the NEW van last night.  He knows how to suck wet.  I love him.  Oh.  Uh, Anthony, stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Yes, it works.  It works. 
[00:47:30]  We've heard from listeners, uh, all over.  All over the area.  They've lost a lot of weight with stacker two.  Maybe, uh, Spaz needs a stacker two.  Maybe that's all he needs today.  Well, yeah, I think if we popped a stacker two in him, he would, uh, wake right to F up.  Yeah.  We'd take the edge off whatever he's on.  Uh, stacker two does the three things.  It does give you a boost of energy late in the day.  Yeah.  It crushes the cravings of snack in between meals.  And, of course, it burns the fat because they do call it the world's strongest fat burner, Anthony.  Yes.  All that adds up to losing weight. 
[00:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  As this heat wave continues, you're going to want to lose weight, right?  Got to shed the clothes and you don't want to be a big...  All right.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Give them a call.  1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker two, the world's strongest fat burner.  Our listeners have proven it works.  OPNN Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[00:48:30]  Ah, tell us that's what it's all, is it?  Let me now, let me now, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Let me now, let me now, come on.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  It's the ONA Show, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Let's go to the phones.  A lot of people checking in today, Anthony.  John, you're next on NAW.  Hey, phones, what's up? 
[00:49:00]  Hanging out.  Yeah, hanging out.  Did you guys check out the Daily News today?  I sure did.  Front page.  Did you see the WoW on it?  WoW made the front page today.  I couldn't believe it.  I had to call you guys and tell you guys about that.  And the look who's in the front, the chick is right next to it.  I know.  It looks like whoever works at that, I don't know.  It says Fort Lee, I think.  In Fort Lee.  It looks like they wrote the WoW on there for us.  Oh, man, that was perfect.  That was perfect.  You guys made the front page.  Yeah, we're talking about the lottery thing.  Yeah, the location on the ground, fellas. 
[00:49:30]  All right, thank you.  Thank you, John.  325 mil, I guess.  Yeah, up for grabs.  And there's a picture on the front page.  It shows 325 mil.  And then under it says, wow.  Yeah.  But it looks like one of the workers just kind of wrote wow.  Scribbled wow.  I think wow is self-explanatory.  A lot of people didn't see the front page of the Daily News today  because they had that special wraparound.  Oh, I thought it would never end.  Oh, that covered the Cardinal's funeral, Anthony.  How many times do we have to see the one-legged kid? 
[00:50:00]  Well, you want to bring up the one-legged kid thing?  It's a cute little story and stuff.  Cute, touching story.  Let me tell you something, man.  There's a picture in the paper of the Clintons hugging the kid.  Yeah.  Kneeling down and talking to the kid.  Yeah.  That is called a photo op.  Right.  They don't give a flying F.  They don't give a flying F about one lousy crippled kid in St. Patrick's funeral.  You got one leg.  I have three.  I'm like the human tripod. 
[00:50:30]  You know, Giuliani and his people are like, son of a bitch.  Get me the one-legged kid.  Right.  Because it looks good for Hillary.  There's a picture of Hillary.  Damn it.  You know, kneeling down with the one-legged kid from the Cardinal's funeral.  She outdid me.  Get me a kid without a head.  Right.  I want a headless child to hug.  Oh, Hillary's always seen hugging and kissing things.  It's a PR move.  And the paper, enough with this one-legged kid.  Yeah.  They're explaining how the one-legged kid, when the coffin was being carried downstairs there 
[00:51:00]  at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Anthony, had to get the wraparound.  And they were explaining that the kid, you know, jumped into the aisle and saluted the  coffin.  Yeah.  And he was wobbly, because he only has one leg, and he needs both hands to keep himself  balanced.  Oh.  But he let go of one crutch to, you know, salute the Cardinal, and he almost fell over.  And everyone's like, oh, look at the cute little kid with the one leg, you know, saluting  the Cardinal.  Why don't you help him out and give him a seat? 
[00:51:30]  Everyone's just staring at the kid as he's wobbling and almost falling over.  Help him out.  Did it, was it made to look like some spontaneous thing?  Like he just all of a sudden walked in the aisle?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  No.  I think they told him, you know, you hobble out there.  With all the politicians that were in that damn church yesterday, I don't care if you  don't have any arms or legs, you're not getting close to all those politicians.  Has he started the talk show circuit yet? 
[00:52:00]  I'm sure somebody will be interviewing the cute one-legged kid, cute little kid, going  to pop up on Letterman's chair or something, you know?  You know, I feel sorry for the kid's plate and all, but, you know, don't be fooled.  What happened to the pig?  It's a, uh, he has a disease that, um, I forgot the disease I read all about today.  Maybe Spaz has that.  He was born without a leg, Anthony.  Oh, he was.  He's got some liver problems.  Aw, poor little kid.  So, I mean, his plight is pretty sad, but, I mean, the politicians just, with the photo  ops.  Yeah.  I mean, I hope you guys see through with that crap. 
[00:52:30]  There's the picture of Clinton.  Like, Clinton has time to bend down and hug the kid and say a couple words to him.  How you doing?  Yeah, look at the picture of him.  And Hillary's smile, like, oh, I win.  I win.  Yeah, because there's a picture of Hillary next to the one-legged kid.  That's going to help her in the race.  They have the whole layout of who's who at the funeral.  Mm-hmm.  Of who was sitting where.  Look at that.  Let's see.  First Lady Hillary.  Behind Hillary was Pataki. 
[00:53:00]  Gore next door.  Clinton next door.  Where the hell is Rudy?  Because I know they were like.  No, Rudy was sitting pretty much right next to the president.  I think there might have been one person in between them or something.  Who's that?  George Bush was on the other side of the aisle?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Isn't that funny?  They popped him over there, huh?  I can't find out where Giuliani is in this.  He was right there.  I believe he was right next to the president.  Yeah, that's what I think. 
[00:53:30]  Which is a little weird.  You'd think they would have put him on the other side.  With his big peluga whale head.  Look at that.  Hey, you know, it's funny.  They were showing some old clips of Cardinal O'Connor.  And they have some old clips of him with Giuliani.  And oh my God.  I mean, you look from years ago, you kind of forget.  He had a little more hair covering that big balloon head, that light bulb head.  And now it's just in full retreat.  That Simon Barsinister globe of his.  Now his head is a light bulb. 
[00:54:00]  It is shaped exactly like a light bulb.  Where's a light bulb?  I want to draw a little Giuliani face on it.  It would look just like him.  Poor guy.  I think that's going to hurt him.  His chances of winning.  But just the way he looks, you know.  I don't know.  He's got that prostate thing.  It's just a mess.  Yeah, but he's more human than Hillary.  Believe it or not.  I know that's a scary statement, but he is. 
[00:54:30]  I guess they're saying during the debates and stuff,  he's faring much better than her because his human side comes out.  Yeah.  You know, he has emotion whether you like it or don't.  He at least has something you can understand.  Human emotion.  Yeah, she is.  Hillary just stares with those big eyes and you can tell she's just not there.  Like Louis Black says.  Yeah.  She doesn't have an emotion in her body.  Yeah.  Cyborg.  She doesn't care about the people of New York.  She just cares about her own damn career. 
[00:55:00]  Is that breaking news?  Breaking news.  The police commission has prostate cancer.  No.  Howard Safer?  Howard does?  Yeah.  Howard Safer has prostate cancer?  Is he a Met fan or a Yankee fan?  Anyone know?  I want to see if Spaz is theory.  All right.  So enough with the one-legged kid.  Yeah.  I think he was a little staged.  They're going to be parading him all over the place now. 
[00:55:30]  Talk shows.  We'll be on Lano, Letterman.  Letterman will have the one-legged kid.  Can we get him, Rick?  Book the one-legged kid.  Want him on this show.  Yeah, that'll happen.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break, Anthony.  Wow.  Phone's going nuts.  Well, we're trying to catch up.  The whole Spaz sickness thing put us behind here.  She certainly did.  We're going to do another WOW sticker stop today, Anthony.  But we have to be incognito today.  Yeah.  Oh, really? 
[00:56:00]  I'm trying to give out a hint.  We'll be somewhere between like 5.30 and 6.30.  Can't say where though?  We can't say?  Where are we going to be with the sticker stop?  Well, how the hell is anybody supposed to get there?  Well, it's going to be at an event.  Okay.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Ah, screw that.  The cops will help us out up there, right?  They're worried about the cops up there.  We just want to give out our WOW stickers.  You're not going? 
[00:56:30]  No, just the sloth.  The sloth.  The sloth is going to give out some stickers.  The sloth is heading to Yankee Stadium today.  Let's do it.  There you go.  Yankee Stadium, before the game tonight, get your WOW stickers.  The sloth.  We're going to be incognito, though.  We're going to have some backpacks because, you know, we're just going to be walking around  hanging them out.  Okay?  All right?  All right.  Speaking of the sloth, has he made it to work today?  The three-toed sloth?  We have Earl's air check tape from Saturday. 
[00:57:00]  Ah, the sloth live on the air.  Yes.  The sloth show.  A lot of people said that Earl did a rock and roll radio show Saturday night.  Oh, help me.  Help me.  Help me.  Somebody help me.  Help me.  Help me.  And a lot of people said it was very entertaining, so we searched all over the damn place and  we found a couple of breaks, Anthony.  Oh, Lordy Lord.  He's desperate.  Do what he says.  Do what he says. 
[00:57:30]  So, Earl's air check from Saturday.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  We'll do that next.  Stay there.  Some days, you know, we're a laugh riot and other days we just flat out suck.  We know it.  And Chris staying after the truth.  Hopefully he has answered it.  1-0-2-7.  B-M-E-W.  Ah, it's the O&A show.  Rush, uh, Russ from Jersey, right?  Hey, fellas, welcome Trent Reznor in New York City for me. 
[00:58:00]  Nine Inch Nails at the Garden tonight.  It's going to effing rock.  Yeah.  And Nin playing.  Nin.  Nin.  I can't believe I did that.  Oops.  Nin, dude.  Just trying to be cool.  And rock.  Nin playing tomorrow at the Coliseum.  Ah, I can't believe I said that.  Nin.  Nin.  You rock, dude.  Yeah.  All right.  Maria just got wowed.  Maria, what's going on? 
[00:58:30]  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm okay.  Hey, look it.  The nastiest thing happened to me.  Yeah.  First of all, I was in my sister's car somewhere in the Bronx.  And I had given her, I'd written down wow on a piece of paper, real pretty.  And I said, just put it on your windshield.  She goes, so what for?  I go, if they see it, you can win $1,000.  So, she put it on there.  She goes, oh, okay.  We'll see.  So, we were on the freeway.  And the nastiest thing happened.  This old lady drove by and honked her horn.  And she pulled out her thingy. 
[00:59:00]  It was so nasty.  And my sister looks at me.  She goes, what was that about?  So, then I had to tell her about the watch.  She got pissed off at me.  All right.  So, you got wowed by an old hag.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you.  That was a great little story, Marie.  All right.  All right.  Earl in the back office, hard at work, getting those wow stickers out.  The self-addressed stamped envelopes just coming in like fan mail for the Hanson brothers, man. 
[00:59:30]  It's just ridiculous at this point.  Hanson going for a new image, Opie.  Yeah, I know.  Did you see that?  They're all over all these magazines now, trying to make their big comeback.  Yeah.  With the fickle 13 and 14-year-old girls who have gone over to all the boy bands now.  Yeah.  Now, Hanson's got to come out with a new album.  And they have a new grown-up image, Opie.  I've been keeping tabs.  They cut their hair and stuff, Anthony, to try to help them.  I don't understand how fans think it's going to help their popularity when they cut their hair and stuff.  Yeah.  Like Metallica went through that whole thing. 
[01:00:00]  Let's change their image, and they come out with short hair and stuff.  And that's supposed to make the album rock that much harder or something?  I don't get it.  Yeah.  The only difference I see is Frank and Hanson's got his braces off.  Mm-hmm.  And the young one looks more like Shaka from Land of the Lost than ever.  Jay Moore brought that up, and I looked at the magazine that they were in, and it was  like, oh, my God.  He's a TV guy or something.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, God, he's right.  And they're all, like, Christian and stuff. 
[01:00:30]  They're all Christian and stuff.  I'm not laughing at you anymore, eh?  I know.  They're going to be pissed when they get older and realize how much quim they turn down.  Yeah.  Earl, what's wrong?  Earl, what's the matter, man?  Earl's in the studio.  He's giving me this look like he's going to get to me.  Oh, wait.  What are you holding?  Put down the knife.  Oh, my God.  It's a letter opener.  Oh, my God.  It looks like a knife.  Put down the knife.  You can do damage with that.  Oh, help me. 
[01:01:00]  Why the nasty look, Earl?  I think I caught what Spaz has got.  What?  What?  Ouch.  Oh, man.  I'm going to get paranoid.  I'm going to get annoyed.  Why?  What happened?  I'm just being a little sluggish.  Sorry.  Fevers.  What?  Sluggish and feverish.  Earl, just so we know, how can we tell if you're sluggish? 
[01:01:30]  Just so we know.  Like, you know, there may be a day you're sluggish.  If we know the telltale, you know, signs that you're sluggish, then we'll know to leave  you alone.  What?  Stop stabbing the console.  You don't threaten me. 
[01:02:00]  So what?  How would we know?  You are awful, man.  What?  I thought we were all just having fun, right, Earl?  You want to have a stare-down?  No.  I'll take you on a stare-down.  Just trying to fight this thing off.  Huh?  I'm just trying to fight it off.  What does it feel like?  I don't understand.  No, I'm just like, I'm losing my voice.  You're losing your voice.  You're feeling tired. 
[01:02:30]  Sneezing fits.  Sneezing fits.  Uh-oh.  And very sluggish.  A little bit.  So is this sickness hindering your job today?  Not at all.  No.  You're able to open up the envelopes and put the WOW sticker in the self-addressed stamped  envelopes that our listeners are sending in.  I'm almost finished with today's batch, actually.  Are the batches getting more or less?  About the same.  About the same every day?  About a box a day. 
[01:03:00]  About a box a day.  Very good.  Nice.  A few hundred stickers going out every day, right?  Yeah.  Easy.  Easily.  All right.  Any suggestions if people want to get their WOW sticker to make your job easier now that  you're a little sick and under the weather?  No.  Just a little more sluggish than normal.  You don't want to go up to Yankee Stadium tonight?  Is that why you're sick? 
[01:03:30]  I'm going.  You're going?  Mm-hmm.  To hand out the WOW stickers?  Mm-hmm.  Go visit the sluggish Earl.  At Yankee Stadium.  The sloth.  Oh, my God.  I don't think he appreciates that name.  Well, I said that we would stop calling you the sloth after today, right?  Earl.  Tomorrow.  Yes.  Tomorrow.  Earl.  Yes.  Know how many people are calling me precious?  If I can handle people calling me precious, I think you can handle people calling you the  sloth for a few days, right? 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Easy.  Hey, precious.  Easy.  Easy.  Easy.  Precious and you are the moments we do can share.  Shut up!  Shut up!  White and blue like the sky, I'm all over you.  Shut up!  And if I can't find my way back home, my voice wouldn't be paid. 
[01:04:30]  Georgia!  That's Georgia!  I know my thing.  Can we see your stuff?  Can we see your stuff?  It keeps you on my mind.  All right.  Enough.  Cut it out, man.  See, I'm taking my abuse, Earl.  I saw you smiling over there.  Spanky, it's time to take your medicine oil.  Earl, we found your radio show from Saturday night. 
[01:05:00]  You're going to get prime time today.  I told you where it was.  It was off the skimmer.  Well, we found it.  Earl did a shift, I guess, Saturday, was it?  I smell an ambush, but hey.  Whoa.  An ambush?  We's going to be bushwaked.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Not bad.  I know why black Earl's feeling sluggish today.  Why?  Bad blue on all those self-addressed stamp envelopes. 
[01:05:30]  It's like on Seinfeld.  Ah.  He's probably licking too many envelopes.  Better watch out.  He's going to pass out soon.  He's going to be all falling over and falling down.  He's not going to know what to do with himself.  Earl, is it bad blue?  No.  No?  I think it's more allergies than anything.  More allergies?  The pollen in the air is getting to you?  Yeah, right.  That's what they all say.  Earl, do you want to go home early today?  I know you put in a solid hour already, but...  Two days in a row. 
[01:06:00]  Do you want to go home early?  You want to work to five?  How many hours a day do you put in, Earl?  Put in eight.  I'm here until 11.  I run down to Mike.  Yeah.  Three to 11?  Yes.  No, I hate that.  All right, so can we play your air check from Saturday?  We heard you had a really good radio show.  From Saturday, yes.  Yeah? 
[01:06:30]  You want to be a rockin' old DJ?  No, not at all.  Really?  I was absolutely terrified Saturday.  You want us to call up the queue for you?  Maybe you could get a half-hour shift?  Yeah, you could do it right after Scotzo's show.  Right.  The Scotzo and Earl hour and a half.  All right, I'm leaving the mic now, handing it over to the capable hands of Earl.  Earl, on the queue. 
[01:07:00]  Okay.  Hey, Earl.  Come in.  Virgin.  Yeah.  That's what we're calling the Earl Show.  Virgin.  Virgin.  Okay, come in.  Got that letter opener.  He's a jam.  I know.  Well, we're going to take a break, Earl, and then we're going to play your radio show from  Saturday.  I hear you were howling after a Guns N' Roses song. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  You got so excited you had a howl.  Oh, my God.  No.  Stop it.  Stop it now.  You know what?  Actually, what happened was...  A K-Dog-type howl?  Yeah.  Yep.  Maybe K-Dog's got rabies.  Are you a K-Dog wannabe?  Hardly.  Oh, my God.  Imitating the spazmeister?  No, that came after...  Whoa!  That came after I finally got an answer from someone regarding, like, what to do, because... 
[01:08:00]  No, I heard that you were...  This is what I heard.  I heard that you had a problem in the studio and you were blaming an imaginary person.  What?  An imaginary person?  That's what I'm hearing.  I haven't heard any of this.  No.  What happened?  Is that true or what?  I heard you had some type of technical problem or something in the studio going on and you  figured I'd better blame someone because I look kind of stupid here.  So you were blaming an imaginary person.  You were yelling at someone.  Make them believe they were the problem.  And John was here, the dumb guy, and said that there was no one in sight. 
[01:08:30]  Is that true or not?  Oh.  Like he screwed up the buttons a little bit and he's yelling.  Right, right.  Hey, what are you doing?  Hey, what?  Wait, what?  No, you can't do that.  Cut it out.  I'm trying to do a show here.  Bob.  Bob.  Who was this person that was wrecking your radio show?  He wasn't wrecking.  He was a friend of mine.  Oh, my God.  And his name?  I'd rather not say that. 
[01:09:00]  Because there was nobody.  Somebody.  Someone go get John.  John can get John the intern.  John the intern.  John the intern?  Yeah.  John.  Do you have an imaginary friend, Earl?  No, I don't.  John, who was Earl yelling at Saturday?  No, he was the only one in here.  He was the only one in here.  You were sitting there playing air guitar.  Oh, oh, Tony Pegg was in here and was the only other person. 
[01:09:30]  But he left early.  So when Earl was yelling and stuff, blaming a screw-up on somebody,  that person wasn't in the studio?  Wasn't in here.  I didn't see anyone.  I was in the other studio.  I saw him playing air guitar through the glass.  Why were you playing air guitar today, Earl?  It was Guns N' Roses.  I like Guns N' Roses.  Yeah, all right.  That's okay.  He was playing some good music, though.  Yeah?  All right.  We'll get into Earl's air check next.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl, can we hear the howl? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  No, a live howl.  I got no voice left.  I can't even do if I wanted to.  Virgin.  All right, and let's play his air check next, okay?  Yeah, I want to hear that.  Earl, would you like to stay in the studio for this,  or would you have to open up more envelopes?  Just asking.  Want him to go out today or not?  Oh.  Oh.  Are you threatening me?  No, I'm just, no, I'm just, I'm not, I'm not meaning it, it's not meant as a threat.  I'm just, I probably would finish. 
[01:10:30]  Well, it usually takes you how many hours to, to, to put 200 envelopes in the mail?  It's more than that.  I'm telling you, we're getting a lot of mail.  Mm.  Which is a good thing.  All right, Earl.  Did you have this kind of energy on your show?  I'm not feeling well.  I'm just trying to find it.  What's that?  Is that what it is?  Earl, you're certainly living up to your new nickname right here.  I'm just a little sluggish, a little slow. 
[01:11:00]  Hey, it's Earl on the morning zoo.  Hello?  Jesus.  He's not going to help you.  Is the pressure...  Oh, thank you, Lord.  Praise Jesus.  Is the pressure of the job getting to you, Earl?  No, not at all.  No?  No?  The ridicule, is it?  Is it?  Ah, the ridicule's getting to you?  Mm.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, if you get a certain amount of ridicule on this show, you get sick, physically 
[01:11:30]  sick, and you've got to go home.  A lot of people going home lately because of this show.  I'm just tired.  Are you going to be the next one that runs out of here?  He already has.  Oh, yeah, you have done that a few times.  All right.  Now, I want to take a nap.  Thank you, Earl.  This was a good segment.  What?  I told you how I feel, and I...  Could you leave your phone off the hook so we can at least call you as you're doing  the wow envelopes so we could make some comments about your tape to you?  Yeah.  I can tell you everything that's wrong with it. 
[01:12:00]  Almost everything.  I'm not wrong with it.  We just want to hear it.  What is Judy saying really fast?  Judy, what's going on?  When I was listening to a show, I don't know, another DJ came on when he was playing some  pretty heavy stuff, and he goes, yeah, I'm an in-the-closet headbanger.  You're an in-the-closet headbanger.  I know you guys are always hideous, and I'm excited not to be in contact with you.  Wait.  An in-the-closet headbanger.  For the love of God, I hope we have that on tape.  He said he's in the closet headbanger? 
[01:12:30]  I said no, I'm in the closet headbanger.  Oh, yeah.  You're a closet headbanger?  An in-the-closet headbanger.  Yeah.  Butt-sex.  An in-the-closet headbanger.  An in-the-closet headbanger.  You're going to have to find it.  Butt-sex.  All right, Judy, we will find that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  A closet headbanger.  Ouch.  Do you want to come out of the closet and admit that you bang heads or what?  Anuses.  No, huh?  I'm going to go now.  Okay. 
[01:13:00]  Earl, everyone.  There he goes.  There he goes.  Earl, there's a headbanging closet.  I'm going to...  All right.  It's already taken 10 seconds to get out of the studio.  Earl, everyone.  There he goes.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, no, no.  Earl.  He's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  Earl, everyone.  Penises.  And finally, Earl, everyone.  There he goes.  It took him 25 seconds to walk out of the studio.  It's very hard.  The three-toed sloth.  It's a seven-foot walk. 
[01:13:30]  You ever watch a sloth on the Discovery Channel climb in the tree and you're just like,  Oh, get up the goddamn tree already.  One hand over the other.  Oh, there he is.  His little three fingers gripping the branch ever so slowly.  Back leg.  Let's go.  Up above the next back leg.  All right.  A bunch of people from this radio show got some good things going on tonight.  Jay Moore on Politically Incorrect Tonight.  I'm here. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, I was pissed off.  I turned it on last night.  I never watched that show because that host, what's his name?  Bill Maher.  Bill Maher is a C.  He's just an ass.  Yeah, he's a douchebag.  He's whatever.  Lewis Black has his special on Comedy Central tonight.  I don't know what time that's on.  10 o'clock tonight on Comedy Central.  And Otto and George playing Rascals tonight, right?  I'm not sure if it's a sold-out show, but I believe it probably is because no one has called us on it. 
[01:14:30]  And I guess it's going to be on the Internet live tonight as well, Otto and George.  So a bunch of people associated with the show having some good stuff happening for them tonight.  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll play Black Girls Radio Show from Saturday.  We have, like, three quick breaks.  Yeah.  Like, a total of, like, four minutes of audio, but I hear it's pretty good.  We'll do that next.  Stay there.  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  I got a lot of personnel.

Sometimes they just throw this stuff into the, uh, the live read book that we have here.  I don't understand, and it's only because, you know, we give a crap. 
[01:17:30]  We want our sponsors to get a good response from, uh, what we do here on the air.  If I was upstairs and I read through this, I would be like, what is that?  What does it mean?

[01:18:30]  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Let's go to Jim real fast.  We're trying to get Black Girl back in the studio.  Jim, what's going on?  Oh, and I, what's going on?  Hey.  How are you today?  I just wanted to thank you guys.  It's the, uh, woman who talked me into the, uh, Tuesday night helmet club today at lunch at work.  Ah.  Ah.  Very good.  Yes.  And, uh, guys.  Yeah.  Do yourselves a favor.  Check out Hollow Ground and lefttheswing.com.  All right.  Cool.  Later, boys.  We'll do that.  Thank you.  There's a little website plug, though. 
[01:19:00]  One of the salespeople have, uh, have ran down from upstairs.  Ah.  Panicky.  They're panicking a little bit.  No, he's shaking his head.  No, not me.  We just don't know what it means.  All right.  Yeah.  Check what local listing.  All right.  There's salespeople running around panicking a little bit.  Feverishly going over the coffee. 
[01:19:30]  Feverishly going over the coffee.  Yeah.  I mean, please.  All right.  The day goes by that we don't piss someone off around here.  I don't get it.  We're just trying to be, uh, a successful radio show.  Giving it a whirl.  Taking a whack at it.  Yes.  Oh, you got the headbanger comment from Earl?  Here, put that in six.  Oh, cool.  Is Earl coming back?  Nope.  He said he won't come back?  Stinky?  He said I ain't coming down there.  Are you doing an imitation of Earl?  That was his exact lines, and I said they wanted you down there, and he doesn't want to go down there. 
[01:20:00]  Could someone get Earl on the phone?  It'll take him a while to crawl back up the hallway.  Those short little steps.  All right.  Here's the headbanger comment from Earl from Saturday's show that he did.  Tarot really knocked me out.  I'm a headbanger.  I'm a closet headbanger at heart.  So we're going to crank it up even louder now.  But thanks.  A short break. 
[01:20:30]  I think we're going to kind of have the unofficial start of Saturday Night Rops.  We've got some cool stuff going on tonight.  Timmy!  You can tell that he's like Earl.  Timmy!  Timmy!  Timmy!  Timmy!  Timmy!  Let me know.  Let me know.  Come on.  Timmy!  Come on.  Okay.  Terrific.  Eddie Trunk sounded thrilled.  Timmy!  Earl's a closet headbanger. 
[01:21:00]  You heard it here first.  Penises.  Butt sex.  Yes.  Indeed.  Oh, oh, help me.  Butt sex.  Oh, Lordy Lord.  Butt sex.  Oh, Lordy Lord.  Penises.  Earl.  What?  Oh, wow.  The angry Earl. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, Earl, you got some energy to you there.  All right.  You woke up.  What's up?  You coming back down or what?  We're just having fun with you.  Huh?  Huh?  No.  Why not, man?  Come on.  We'll listen to your show from Saturday.  Yeah.  Some of your show.  Why won't you come back down here?  Well, I want to finish this mail.  Earl.  What's his name?  Come on, Earl.  That was funny.  Come on.  That's a little play on the word. 
[01:22:00]  You know, M-A-L-E, Earl.  You got it?  Penises.  Yeah.  Earl, are you starting to feel like you're the only one that takes abuse on this radio show?  No.  Okay.  Because everyone's turning the barrel.  Divergent.  Didn't I take about an hour and a half of abuse yesterday?  Yeah, but you told that it was self-inflicted.  Precious.  That's all right, though.  Nothing like therapy on the air.  True.  You want to call me Precious?  No.  Want to get me back, call me Precious?  I'm not going to call you Precious.  Okay. 
[01:22:30]  Get down here.  Earl, why can't you make a concerted effort to come down to this studio?  And where's Don?  Is that Don on the phone?  Come on, Earl.  We heard the first part of your tape.  We thought it was pretty good.  Thank you.  No, I just want to finish.  I just want to knock this out.  I'm Earl Kasem, and now a long-distance dedication.  Earl, how are we going to play your tape if you're not here?  Good.  Have fun with it.  Can we keep you on the phone, maybe? 
[01:23:00]  Sure.  It's a song about a dead sloth named Earl.  How am I supposed to come out of an up-tempo number,  because I'm a closet headbanger,  into a goddamn sloth dying?  Hi.  We've got to play that now.  Earl, I can hear that you're...  It took Earl two hours to hang a picture, too.  Ponderous.  Earl.  Earl, we can hear you opening up envelopes in the background.  Yes, this is true. 
[01:23:30]  All right, Earl, let's play your little show here, okay?  You had a little problem coming out of the Black Crowes record, did you?  Yeah, the sequence.  They sequenced the record pretty poorly,  so it just cuts off at the end.  They sequenced the record poorly?  The Black Crowes sequenced their...  The first pressing of Jake Your Money Maker has bad sequences.  Isn't that called a cold ending, Opie? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, in the biz, sure.  A cold ending, and you have to be ready for it.  Out cue.  Cold.  Well...  Right.  Well, when the ending sustains and it ends cold...  Hard to handle doesn't end cold.  It sustains.  Let's hear the end of that.  Can you get right to the end?  I got it here.  There's two copies in there,  the old copy and the new copy.  Well, I got the old copy.  All right.  All right, let's hear it.  No, hit, uh, it's six.  Earl had a problem.  Track six.  Hit seven and back it up.  Go ahead.  Hit end monitor.  Here we go, Earl. 
[01:24:30]  Fade!  Fade!  It's a friggin' fade!  Earl, that's what we call a fade in the, uh...  I couldn't...  I didn't hear this.  Honestly, I didn't hear it.  That's a fade.  I didn't hear it!  That's a fade.  That's a fade.  That's a fade.  That's a fade.  I didn't get a...  I didn't hear it, guys.  Now, why are the Black Crows cutting their goddamn songs off?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Hi.  Earl.  God, I wonder...  All right, hold on.  Where it is again, Earl? 
[01:25:00]  Listen closely.  It's a face.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  That gives you enough time, doesn't it?  That's a fade.  God...  I didn't hear it, but whatever.  Okay.  Very good.  Maybe we can hear how Earl handled that.  This is the legendary WNEW we're working at, right?  No, I'm just asking.  On the weekend, still probably proud to be the rock of New York.  Sure.  Hey, anyone else want a radio show out there? 
[01:25:30]  At this point, we're just giving anyone a radio show.  All right, Earl, let's play your tape.  You're coming out of the Black Crows here, okay?  All right?  Earl?  Yes, I can use this.  Okay, here's Earl from Saturday night.  One-on-two-seven-WNE, wow, that ended abruptly.  Wow.  Earl, could you cover yourself a little bit there? 
[01:26:00]  Just make believe it didn't happen in the background?  It threw me.  Guys, I'm not a DJ.  What are you on on WNEW in the number one market in the country?  This is the legendary WNEW.  I explained this yesterday.  You know how many years it and I had to wait to work here?  Oh, my God, the dream of coming to any WNEW.  Boy, was that dream shattered quickly.  I explained this yesterday.  I wasn't, when I did the shift, I wasn't supposed to be doing an air shift. 
[01:26:30]  I was supposed to be running the best of a certain show.  Come on!  Where's my tape?  Earl, you didn't hear the fade because of the invisible man that was helping me with the radio show?  The invisible man, Earl.  Earl, all right, here we go.  Did you see Jesus in your sticky bum?  Oh, you're sticky.  All right, here we go.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:27:00]  Wow, that ended abruptly.  1027 WNEW.  Black Crows with Hard to Handle.  And we heard some Zeppelin before that.  Of course, Jimmy Page and the Black Crows coming to town June 30th at the Art Center down in Jersey.  Jones Beach, July 10th.  And there's a rumored date in October at Madison Square Garden.  Looking forward to that.  And I'm looking forward to tomorrow, the Hoboken Spring Arts and Music Festival featuring Patti Smith and Ronnie Spector will be tomorrow.  That's from 11 to 6 down in Hoboken.  The van will be there. 
[01:27:30]  I'll be there.  We'll have plenty of stuff to give away, including Whipple Ball Bats.  Whipple Ball.  Soda.  What?  Wow stickers.  T-shirts.  We'll have a bunch of stuff.  Make sure to stop on by the NAW van tomorrow at the Hoboken Spring Arts and Music Festival featuring Patti Smith and Ronnie Spector, among many others.  It's going to be great.  The weather is going to be great.  It's supposed to hit 94 degrees tomorrow.  So, it's got nothing to do. 
[01:28:00]  Come on down to Hoboken.  Check out the great music.  And hello to us at the NAW van.  Coming.  And coming up in a few minutes, I actually might play some Patti Smith, so stand by.  Oh, wow.  I got a sticker on here.  Geez, man.  Love Radio Tees, man.  Look at you, Earl.  Earl, I must say, that's not a bad break.  That wasn't bad.  Not bad at all.  See, you're expecting us to abuse you, but it was pretty good.  What was the thing with the Whipple Ball Bats?  Well, yeah, it sounds like you had a rocking party out there in Hoboken.  Whipple Ball Bats and soda. 
[01:28:30]  Soda.  Well, we had a couple of clients had products to give away.  We had these.  We had, what's it?  Smart.  Smartworld.com.  Okay.  Head product.  Smallworld.com.  Smartworld.com.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yes.  And one of our clients, Sobe, we had cases, a bunch of cases of soda and I think it was  fruit juice.  Earl is gay.  Terrific.  So I heard you were, like, throwing wiffle balls out to the crowd, huh? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, Matt and I, we were having fun with it.  Okay.  Very good.  Pretty good.  A lot of wow stickers.  A lot of people asked for you at Hoboken.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  I don't think we're invited back to Hoboken.  Well, they were saying, where's Hoboken?  I'm like, he's probably watching the Knick game.  Yeah, pretty much.  I watched him lose this weekend, Earl.  That wasn't a bad first break.  How'd you like to move my law?  Huh?  Earl, Jason from River Edge, New Jersey wants to ask you, did it take Earl six hours to  do a three-hour show?  All right, Earl. 
[01:29:30]  Your first break is very good.  We've got two more to go here, okay?  You think he can handle it?  Go ahead.  All right, on the Earl show, he teased that he's going to be playing some Patti Smith,  you know?  That's going to make me stick around through commercials and stuff, right?  Well, yeah.  You throw out something like that to the people, they're not going anywhere.  You know, when the DJ says, you know, something from Boston's first album, Anthony, I'm glued.  I can't go anywhere.  Got to sit through those spots.  I got to sit there and wonder if it's going to be foreplayed long time or peace of mind.  Yeah.  Or maybe even more than a feeling. 
[01:30:00]  Well, that would be nice.  All right, Earl.  Here's your second break from your show Saturday night.  1027.  1027.  W, Annie W, ACDC.  Who made who?  Told you we were going to play a couple of guitar heroes.  Ted Nugent, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Van Halen, and Angus Young and Company, ACDC on Annie W.  This is Earl Douglas.  I kind of flew into the ship somehow, but I'm having a lot of time.  He said ship. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, he didn't curse?  He said ship.  Oh, you're cursing on the air?  No.  He said ship.  All right, I want to hear it again.  This is Earl Douglas.  I kind of flew into the ship.  I'm having a lot of fun.  The phones have been plugged.  I'm going to try to get to some of your requests a little bit later on.  If you want to make one, give us a call at 212-757-1027.  10 o'clock tonight, Eddie Trump, Saturday Night Rocks, the best variety of hard rock and metal  anywhere.  I just got distracted. 
[01:31:00]  I'm sorry.  But, uh...  Oh, wait, Earl.  Is that the invisible man distracting you?  You use your tongue, Bertier, in a $20 hole.  Hey, Earl.  Earl?  Earl.  Was that the invisible man distracting you in the middle of your radio show?  No.  Do we have it on tape?  The invisible man.  We got the invisible man on tape, Earl.  No.  A friend of mine was mugging me in the corner. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  Butt sex.  Butt sex?  Butt sex.  Penises.  Come on!  All right, Earl.  We got to play this again.  Now, explain what was going on.  You were in the middle of a pretty good break there, right?  Yeah.  You seemed focused.  You were talking about Eddie Trunk's Saturday Night Rock show.  Things were moving along there, right?  Yeah.  And then what happened?  What happened with the invisible man in the corner?  I was getting mugged.  He was making funny faces at me. 
[01:32:00]  He was making funny faces?  I was just like...  I just lost my concentration.  And do we know the name of this person yet?  You had to have something before you lost it.  No, honestly, I promise not.  I knew this was going to come out.  I promise I'm not the same.  What was it, Scott Muti?  No.  Coming by to visit his old haunt?  All right, listen to Earl as he...  As he gets distracted by the invisible man, Anthony.  Here it is.  And we're going to try to get to some of your requests a little bit later on.  If you want to make one, give us a call at 212-757-1027. 
[01:32:30]  10 o'clock tonight, Eddie Trunk.  Saturday Night Rocks, the best variety of hard rock and metal anywhere.  And...  I just got distracted.  I'm sorry.  But, uh...  That'll be in around 10 o'clock.  Stop that.  Ed, I...  Stop that.  Stop that.  Stop that.  Stop that.  I got to hear that again.  Earl!  You were being mugged?  Not being...  You know when guys make funny faces? 
[01:33:00]  The invisible man was touching you?  Stop it.  I heard you were the only one in here, dude.  Everyone is saying you were the only one in here, and you were talking to yourself.  No, that's not true.  Oh, liar.  Liar.  Liar.  Liar.  Were you there?  Earl, here's a...  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Look like that scene at the end of the fight game.  Were you here?  Ed Norton's pulling himself around the room.  Help me!  Help me!  Help me!  Please!  Can you get the invisible man on the phone so we can talk to him?  I think he's kind of tough, because he's not here. 
[01:33:30]  Earl, here's a doll.  He's not here.  No, he's not in New York.  Opie, his name is George Glass.  Not New York.  Well, John is screaming.  Our intern, John, is screaming.  He said he was here.  He's a witness.  I knew he was here.  He said there was no one in the studio.  Earl, I saw you from the other studio.  You were the only person in the studio at the time.  There was no one else here.  You were in air, too.  Yeah, and I came in how many times to get carts from the... 
[01:34:00]  He's like Jim Carrey in Liar Liar, beating himself up and stuff.  How many CDs did I come back and forth to get?  You were the only one in here.  Earl, the invisible man was touching you.  Here's a doll.  Show us on the doll where the invisible man was touching you.  Did he touch you where your bathing suit covers?  Let me hear that again, because I've got to hear how he really plays this off.  All right, Caitlin from Brooklyn. 
[01:34:30]  Hey, guys, I'm a 16-year-old high school student with no radio experience.  When do I get my own show on any W?  Hey, come on in.  All right, Earl.  We're a little worried about you.  You've got invisible man distracting you and touching you.  All right, I backed up the break.  Everything was going okay until the invisible man showed up.  Here we go.  Later on, if you want to make one, give us a call at 212-757-1027.  10 o'clock tonight, Eddie Trunk.  Saturday Night Rocks, the best variety of hard rock and metal anywhere. 
[01:35:00]  And I just got distracted.  I'm sorry.  But I don't kneeling around 10 o'clock to play the best hard rock and metal for you right here on any W.  And we'll come back.  Little Death Leopard.  Earl, come on. 
[01:35:30]  Earl.  What was the invisible man doing to you?  What kind of face did he make?  Butt sex.  Ouch.  Butt sex.  Ouch.  Earl.  Earl.  He's getting mad.  Earl.  Earl.  Penises.  Earl, this is too good.  Do not become silent now.  Tell us what the invisible man was doing that distracted you to the point where you had to tell him to stop it. 
[01:36:00]  Earl.  Earl, come on.  Come on, man.  Well, maybe could it be that John didn't see the guy because the guy was under the console on the other side?  He couldn't see what he did.  It's a possibility.  Earl.  Earl, are you just staring into the receiver?  Earl.  Earl.  Come on.  Tell us what the invisible man was doing.  You could be honest and tell us that there was no invisible man. 
[01:36:30]  We'll be okay with that.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl, we'll just play the break over again.  Earl, come on.  Earl.  Is he there?  Earl.  I didn't hear a hang-up.  No, he's still there.  Earl, come on, man.  He does this all the time.  He gets really mad.  He did my envelope.  He's on a union break now.  He's got to know.  All right, we're going to have to play the Earl break again with the invisible man.  Here it is.  10 o'clock tonight, Eddie Trump, Saturday Night Rocks, the best variety of hard rock and metal anywhere. 
[01:37:00]  And...  I just got distracted.  I'm sorry.  But, uh...  I don't think we're going to run 10 o'clock.  What?  I don't think we're going to run 10 o'clock to play the best hard rock and metal for you right here on N.E.W.  And we'll come back with a Def Leppard.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Earl.  Come on, Earl.  I know you're there.  Earl, Earl, can you hear me? 
[01:37:30]  We make more people run home early.  I know.  What is it?  Come on.  Well, Rick ran down the hall to see if his phone is still off the hook.  Now, where's Rick?  Whose microphone was Earl talking into?  Well, all right, Ant, let's take a break.  Yeah, we've got to find Earl.  We've got to find Earl.  This is a little weird.  All right, Rick's calling in, I think. 
[01:38:00]  I know, it's Rick.  Just put him on hold so we can talk to him.  Thank you.  Earl.  What happened?  I don't know.  The phone hung up?  I don't know.  We just kind of cut off.  All right, we just need to know what was the invisible man doing or what kind of face he was making that would make you stop your radio show and say, stop it.  I was just, you know, like a silly face.  Like, what kind of silly face?  We all know silly faces.  Which one? 
[01:38:30]  You know, where you put your thumbs on your ears and do the...  You know, that one?  That one?  Yeah, just very cynical.  Like, yeah, right.  The yeah, right.  And I'm like, how about that?  Hey!  No, man.  Hey!  You reacted like you was tickling your kiki or something.  No, it's just...  Hey!  I'm not going to even dignify you.  Well, who is this imaginary friend? 
[01:39:00]  Hey, I'm not at liberty to say.  Are you sure?  Why is that?  You know you're not allowed to just have anybody come up here while you're doing a radio show.  Is it somebody that used to work here?  No, not at all.  No?  Do you see this person often?  Actually, he's in for the weekend.  He's in for the weekend.  Is he near you now?  No.  Sure.  Is he on the air here at any time?  No, not at all.  No.  White or black? 
[01:39:30]  White.  Guy?  Yeah.  Well hung?  No.  Mark Perrano?  Stop it.  All right, you want to play the third break of Earl's show?  Uh, yeah, I got to hear the rest of this.  All right, Earl.  Does the Invisible Man chime in anymore?  Yeah.  Is that it with the Invisible Man, Earl?  Earl?  You.  We'll agree to disagree.  We think there's an Invisible Man.  If this is somebody that's really real, okay. 
[01:40:00]  Maybe we get the mummy or Nosferatu in the next break.  Right.  All right.  I think this is the last Earl break, right?  We only have three.  W-A-N-E-W-E-B-H.  W-A-N-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E-W-E.  Was that you?  Was that you?  Was that you wooing?  Yes, that was me wooing.  Wait, I got to hear the woo again. 
[01:40:30]  That was pretty good.  We almost missed it.  Here it is.  B.E.W. is B.E.W.  Hey!  N.E.W. 1027.  Hey!  God, I miss that band.  Paradise City.  There was a great piece in Rolling Stone, I believe, two issues ago.  What Axl Rose has been up to.  Apparently, they're making new music.  Not the original band. 
[01:41:00]  Axl is making music.  We're making four producers, several band members, and what, about two years later?  We might just actually get a new Guns N' Roses album sometime this millennium.  Stay tuned.  This is Earl Douglas sitting in for Tim Tyrell.  Eddie Trunk will be in at 10 o'clock with Saturday Night Rocks.  The best variety of hard rock and heavy metal.  I'm out of breath.  I was playing a guitar in the studio.  But it'll be out at 10 o'clock as usual every Saturday night. 
[01:41:30]  And make sure you get this number down, 212-757-1027.  Or if you want to call us, call 3-877-692-1027.  We'll take requests until 10 o'clock and even after 10 o'clock when Ed gets on the air.  Earl, that was a good radio break there.  Earl? 
[01:42:00]  Thank you.  George!  It's George!  Earl, are you thinking about teaming up with the Invisible Man to do maybe like a duo show?  A lot of duo shows here at the N.E.W.  Yeah.  You need an on-air partner at this station.  You've got Scott and Sid, Opie and Anthony, Don and Mike, Earl and the Invisible Man.  Kimmy!  Kimmy!  Earl?  The Slot Show!  Earl? 
[01:42:30]  Earl?  Earl?  Earl?  Hello?  Earl?  Hey.  Hi.  You sounded good.  Thank you.  The Invisible Man thing was...  I'm getting the hindsight here because I've got to go up to the stadium.  The Invisible Man thing's a little wacky, but...  Yeah.  I mean, guys, I'm getting the hindsight to go up to the stadium now.  So, unlike Psycho Mark, I've got work to do.  Unlike Psycho Mark, you've got work to do.  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  I can't go.  I've got to do stuff for Ron and Finn.  All right.  Earl's going to be heading up to Yankee Stadium to get out Wow stickers.  Earl, that shouldn't take you too long to get up there, right?  No.  I'm going to jump on the train.  Oh, the train?  Mm-hmm.  Eddie Trunk from Saturday Night Rocks wants to comment about your show Saturday.  Okay.  Eddie?  Kimmy!  Eddie, Eddie.  Yo.  What's up?  First of all, I just got in the car, and I just want to say thanks. 
[01:43:30]  This is the most promotion I've gotten in two years.  Yeah, there you go.  I never had this many high-profile mentions ever.  But I'm just trying to get a handle on when exactly in the show The Invisible Man Break took place.  The Invisible Man Break.  Yeah, Earl, was Eddie Trunk around when your friend wasn't here?  No.  No, huh?  That's why I asked, because I got in about, um...  Kimmy!  ...at 8.39 o'clock, and Earl was solo at that point, so I just didn't know if that break was recorded earlier or later in his show. 
[01:44:00]  So, Earl, all right, let's piece this together.  The Invisible Man was in the studio, and he distracted you to the point where you had to tell him to stop it, so we're assuming he was fondling you or something.  No, he was not fondling.  And then all of a sudden, he...  Did he leave the station?  He wasn't here that long.  He was here five minutes.  I thought he was in town for the weekend.  Yeah, he was here for five minutes.  So, the Invisible Man was here for five minutes to distract you, and then he left. 
[01:44:30]  Heard me on the air, popped in, said hello, left.  All right, everyone, someone's got to go downstairs and check with the lobby, the records, who signed in.  Yes.  We'll find out who this mystery man is.  Yes.  Eddie, we have a witness.  John, our intern was here, and he was watching Earl as he was doing the Invisible Man break and said he was talking to himself.  There was no one here.  So, that break had to come in the first half of his program, then, because I was driving in, and I punched on the station, and I heard Earl on the air. 
[01:45:00]  And I called him up, and, you know, normally I'm hearing Lycus, not that, you know, that's what...  Well, anyway.  Come on!  But I said, Earl, what happened to Lycus?  Because I knew he was running it, and he said that the disc didn't show up, yada, yada, yada.  And then I got in there, and when I got there about 8.15, he was solo.  So, I don't know where that break took place.  Earl?  Earl?  Yes.  Any thoughts?  No. 
[01:45:30]  When was the Invisible Man in the studio?  I had no idea.  Everything was just happening so fast.  The Lycus disc didn't make it, because you're not allowed to mail narcotics through the mail.  Anything that might make you drowsy.  Wow!  Uh, between 7 and 8, Earl?  No, I don't...  I don't know, guys.  Earl?  Do you see dead people?  Thank you, man.  I believe the Invisible Man was Martin Landau.  All the evidence, Earl, points to an Invisible Man in the studio. 
[01:46:00]  Do you agree with this, man?  Oh, Earl, one more thing.  Who were you having butt sex with?  Oh, we lost Earl.  He hung up.  Did he hang up?  He hung up.  And who is this mysterious Timmy?  You guys don't have the crossover break when Earl asks me to cross over with him, do you?  Oh, yeah, we do.  Oh, God, I've got to hear that.  We said how thrilled you sounded, Eddie.  Because I was just... 
[01:46:30]  Well, first of all, the thing that I was...  I'm coming in, and basically most of the music that was on prior to me coming in was a recreation of a lot of the stuff I had planned on playing.  So I had to scrap a lot of stuff in my first hour because, you know, there was a lot of stuff that, you know, it started early.  And the other thing was that I was like, hey, man, I spent 11 years making minimum wage in suburban radio, and Earl's doing 6 to 10 the shit before me.  I know.  Well, you know, Earl did a pretty good job. 
[01:47:00]  You know, the Invisible Man thing was wacky.  Obviously, he got distracted.  He was trying to cover himself up, and he's not man enough to admit it.  A lot of people want to know how a three-toed sloth plays air guitar.  In a lot of ways, you're right.  I heard some of the breaks.  I thought that he did do a pretty good job, but I did not hear the Invisible Man break, and that's why I was just curious if that was when I was there or not.  It's funny because he starts giggling like a schoolgirl and says, stop it.  We got the crossover with you, Eddie, when Earl admitted that he was a closet headbanger. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, here it is.  Tarot really knocked me out.  I'm a headbanger.  I'm a closet headbanger.  So we're going to crank it up even louder now for a lot of these commercials.  After this short break, we're going to kind of have the unofficial start of Saturday Night Rocks.  We got some cool stuff going on tonight.  There you go.  You sound so thrilled, man.  It's like Earl, get out of my studio.  You didn't get the earlier part when I asked him how he was doing this, and my jealousy that he just jumped right into a primetime weekend shift. 
[01:48:00]  Well, anyone could have a radio show at any W.  Yeah.  Obviously.  All right, Eddie.  So we'll check out Saturday Night Rocks Saturday at 10.  Thanks for the plugs, guys.  All right, Eddie.  Appreciate it.  Bye.  Bye.  There he goes, Eddie Trump.  Kimber!  Kimber!  All right, man.  Well, there's Earl's little radio show from Saturday. 
[01:48:30]  He took a lot of abuse.  He did a very good job for a last-minute filling and all that.  I've got to find out who this person is, though, that he says was in the studio.  There was nobody.  There was nobody.  There was nobody.  There was nobody.  It's a ghost.  It's hilarious.  Phantom.  The Invisible Man.  All right, we'll take a break, right?  There's a man on the wing.  There's a man on the mic.  There's a man on the studio.  Can't believe it.  All right.  All right, man. 
[01:49:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're never going to announce anything.  It's awful.  It's awful.  Very, very effective.  It's all of a straight for the airwaves.  I cannot believe that those morons are on the air.  I don't know, Anthony.  I think this is better than a rock block, don't you?  Only half is nauseating.  It's the O.N.A. Show.  212-757-1027.  That was funny.  Yeah, that was fun.  Yeah, the Earl thing was very funny. 
[01:49:30]  Joe Soprano from foundrymusic.com writes,  The Tom Likas discs did show up.  Earl was just too lazy to get them,  so decided to do a radio show Saturday.  Very good, Joe.  Hey, Peter, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, you guys?  How are you?  Yeah, check it out.  That was like Edward Norton's character in Fight Club.  They're talking to themselves, hitting themselves.  Yeah, maybe he's got like a Tyler Durden.  There you go.  It was Tyler Durden in the studio with him. 
[01:50:00]  With Earl.  All right.  Got to be careful.  Thank you.  He swears there was somebody in the studio.  Yeah, sure, just like Tyler Durden was the same guy as Edward Norton.  I can't say who it was, but he's a guy that sells soap, makes soap for a living.  Sells soap.  I'm my friend.  We live in a house on Paper Street and it's falling apart.  All right.  Thank you, Peter.  Hey, can I get a plug?  Yeah.  Yeah, my band Stage is playing at Bowery Ball on May 25th. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  All right.  Everyone check out Stage.  Thanks, guys.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  All right, Anthony.  Tomorrow is going to be a very exciting wow day.  Yeah.  I mean, with this heat wave that's upon us.  Yeah.  Now, what is it supposed to be tomorrow?  Have you checked the local weather forecast?  I would assume like today.  Tomorrow's weather.  We'll be back later on the program to tell you.  In that time, you could have told me.  Here's the weather.  Tomorrow, just like today.  Yeah.  Now, let's do sports.  Cool. 
[01:51:00]  I hope so.  I hope it's blazing.  Girls just walk in the streets nude.  They're pretty much doing that right now.  Yeah.  I saw some sights at lunch today.  Man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.  I love this time of year.  Mm-hmm.  I got to bring my night shot camcorder in again and try that again.  With the girls wearing the black?  Yeah.  Girls that are wearing the really, you know, those very form-fitting black summer dresses.  They're very tight.  If you look through the night shot, which is like the infrared that I have on the camera, 
[01:51:30]  you're supposed to be able to see right through the clothes.  See them naked.  Have to do that.  It was funny because when we used to drive in, you would drive and do that at the same time.  Yeah, I was trying to drive and look at the same time and beeping at cabs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, but wow tomorrow is going to be huge.  If you don't have your wow stickers yet, well, make the homemade wow signs.  We love the homemade wow signs.  Yeah.  We took phone calls from ladies last week for, I don't know, it had to be 20 minutes straight 
[01:52:00]  that swore if they saw a wow sign on the highway, they would wow.  Mm-hmm.  They just don't want to just wow cars that don't have the stickers on it because they don't  know who they are and stuff.  Right.  But if you get the wow on your car, you have a very good chance of seeing something.  Mm-hmm.  The ladies proved it last week.  Yeah.  You know?  They're like, I even dressed appropriately to wow, but I couldn't find a sticker on my  way home.  No.  So that's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow.  And Paul, the pilot's coming in tomorrow. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, the guy that Sky wrote wow over Manhattan.  Over Central Park.  It was huge.  It was great.  Absolutely huge.  Uh, probably the sickest thing anyone has ever done for our radio show.  Even though it was visible.  Even though a lot of people are trying to beat Paul already, hanging banners over highways  and stuff.  Over the expressway.  That's great.  I was hoping Paul was going to do it again tomorrow, but instead we're going to like,  uh, uh, have him in here and treat him right for...  That's cool.  ...for going the distance for the show and writing wow over Manhattan. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  So he's coming in with, uh, Shannon, the hot wax girl's coming back tomorrow.  Oh, really?  And Paul's going to be aiming on her belly.  Well, we're going to see how good he is at, uh, pilot to bombardier kind of thing.  Yeah.  Dropping some wax bombs on him.  We're going to, uh, see if he could, like, uh, you know, write wow in hot wax on her...  The Norton Bonsai on her belly.  Releasing the big bomb out of being all the gay.  Hey, I've got to say hi to a couple of cops that I passed on Coney Island Avenue. 
[01:53:30]  They didn't pull me over.  Oh, my God, dude.  I'm just getting brazen now.  It's just a matter of time.  Get this.  I'm driving down Coney Island Avenue.  They were in an unmarked car, which I thought was one of those goddamn cabs, you know?  So a bus pulls out into the, uh, two lanes going in my direction.  Pulls out.  Takes up both lanes.  He stops in front of me.  There's a perfectly good left turn lane to my left.  So I just pull in there, gun it, pass the cops and the bus and a couple of trucks that 
[01:54:00]  are in front, and then whizz back into the lane.  Woo!  It gets right up on my ass.  Oh!  Stuff's going on like, uh-oh, uh-oh.  And then he kind of passed by next to me and stuff.  And I guess everything is cool.  Well, he saw what you had on your windshield, you bastard.  Yeah, you bastard.  Hey, thanks, Frank.  Where was all this stuff?  Get out of jail for your car.  Where was all this stuff when I was driving?  I don't know.  I'm just, I'm minutes away from just driving down into the subway. 
[01:54:30]  At this point, just trying to squeeze the truck down there onto a subway platform.  Anthony, this just in.  Yeah?  Black girl has officially been syndicated.  No, in this company, Black girl can be heard over the Westwood One radio network.  Right.  In every major city across the country.  Yes.  Everyone gets syndicated except you and I here at N.E.W.  We'd like to welcome our affiliates.  Our affiliates in Los Angeles, California. 
[01:55:00]  I want you to know I'm a closet headbanger.  Come here!  Earl syndicated.  Earl is officially syndicated, Anthony.  Great.  Yes.  The Earl radio network.  On the Earl, from the top of the Earl building.  That old gag.  Oh, what a buzzer.  All right.  Well, Earl will be at the stadium for the Yankee game, handing out the WOW stickers today. 
[01:55:30]  A lot of great email that came in.  I want to read a couple of these really fast.  Oh, someone wants us to play the Green Bay prank call, funeral parlor.  They want to get a copy of that.  Oh, great.  What?  Where I look like a bad guy.  What?  Is that the one where I look like a bad guy?  From our CD to Menoworld.  No, that's a great one.  Oh, that one.  I thought you meant the other one.  No, we don't.  I cannot find a copy of that.  I'm really pissed off. 
[01:56:00]  Thank God.  Because I always look like the psychopath on this radio show, but you've done some things  in the past as well.  We've said it many times.  Ann likes to go through the obituaries in the paper, find out where people are being  laid out to rash.  Well, I don't like to do this.  It's a prank that I used to do as a kid.  As a kid?  We did it two years ago, and I had a tape of it, and when we got fired, I couldn't get  it out of my desk fast enough.  And if you look in the obituaries of the newspaper, and you see who just died, and where they're 
[01:56:30]  going to be laid out, and when, you wait until that time is happening.  You call up, and if the guy's name is John Smith, you just go, in a somber voice, is John  Smith there today?  Yeah.  And they go, yes, yes, he is.  You go, could you put him on the phone, please?  And then you just wait for the uncomfortable silence.  It's very uncomfortable, too.  Yeah, especially when the son of the deceased picks up the phone and starts really laying  into you.  There's a couple of websites that have it. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, it's really bad.  I will find a copy of that, definitely.  Oh, it's no worse than,  I don't know what you're talking about.  But I was just talking about.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.  Bill, I love him.  There's a, good night, condolences to the chief.  Okay, we've played that one enough.  I know, I love it.  Yeah, that's great. 
[01:57:30]  Earl Till, Earl, Opie tells a woman that her friend is dead when she calls up.  It's so bad.  I got enough checks in the psycho column.  Thank you very much.  The management of Bell Atlantic has decreed that the posting of wow paraphernalia on  company vehicles to be a violation of company policy that would lead to termination.  Please inform the faithful followers of the Opie and Anthony show that the Bell Atlantic  logo is the equivalent of a wow sticker.  Oh, there you go.  I like how you guys think. 
[01:58:00]  So, ladies, if you see the Bell Atlantic trucks and there's a guy that looks desperate  driving.  Bell Atlantic.  Help him out.  He can't put the wow in his car anymore.  Or on the truck anymore because he's going to get fired.  Okay?  Cool.  I don't want to play Bill's dead.  Bill?  Oh, girl, love him.  Well, we do have a lot of new listeners.  This is great.  This is brutal.  Come on, you know something?  The whole concept of this is just part of the beauty of this whole thing, Opie. 
[01:58:30]  The woman's voice is what kills me.  Once you hear it, you'll be doing it for years.  As a goof.  Yeah, we do it all the time.  Oh, no.  Whenever something happens, like we get news that we're not going to be syndicated for  another six months, we just look at each other and go, oh, no.  What happened?  Right.  We were just doing so well.  You know, it could be incorporated into your everyday life.  It's great.  Oh, no.  All right.  Well, here's Bill.  But you said the reports weren't due until Saturday. 
[01:59:00]  Now he wants them tomorrow.  Incorporated into your daily life.  All right.  Here's Bill's dead, you bastard.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Uh, well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Uh, Bill, uh, Bill died today.  Your kid, oh, my God. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Tragic.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  Who is this?  John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Oh, terrible. 
[02:00:00]  Where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God, mother.  Yeah, big, big, big pile-up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  All right, John.  You are awful.  Bill. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, I love them.  I was just...  Oh, no.  Oh, precious.  Is this precious?  Oh, no.  Precious, where are you, precious?  Shut up!  But I was just talking to you, precious. 
[02:01:00]  All right, let's try to do a mix here.  Mix.  Yeah.  Let's start with this.  Precious.  Where are you, precious?  I can't see you.  Precious and you are the most sweetest you can share.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat. 
[02:01:30]  How are you?  Now, this is the morning, Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Magic.  Who is this?  He was in a car accident today.  No.  Who is this?  Ben.  Shut up! 
[02:02:00]  Shut up!  Shut up!  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  I just want to tell you to him.  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[02:02:30]  Where did this happen?  This afternoon.  Where?  My life.  Oh, God.  Awesome.  Yeah.  It's a big pile up.  You are the most sweet you can't care.  You are the most sweet you can't care. 
[02:03:00]  Well, be sure and get the kids, my kids out.  Yeah.  All right, John.  Thanks.  Well, wait.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Bill.  Precious.  I was just talking to you. 
[02:03:30]  Bill.  Precious.  Are you there?  Shut up!  Precious.  Shut up!  Touching.  Yes.  Very, very touching.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay, horrific.  Oh, my God, you have some issues.  Aye, you brought it up.  You're mixing in all the crap.  Pale. 
[02:04:00]  Pale.  Oh, man, yeah.  Opie, how could you be so cruel?  Why?  It happened years ago, right?  Of course.  Right?  Of course.  Right?  You guys understand, right?  Opie, by far the most effed up individual on the ONA show.  Oh, on the ONA show, yeah.  I'm not even the most effed up one in my family.  It gets a lot worse. 
[02:04:30]  I'm one of seven.  Wow.  We go to some dark places in our family.  Paulie, what's going on?  Yo, you guys just made that song up on the radio now?  Yeah.  That was the sickest thing I've ever heard in my life.  You guys are crazy, man.  You can almost put that on the album and sell it in the store.  Almost.  On the occasion today.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Thank you, Paulie.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Oh, my God. 
[02:05:00]  Look at the things coming.  Opie has no soul.  I'll be going to hell.  What?  What happened?  I don't know.  It strikes a nerve every time we play that.  All right.  We'll go to the phones next.  Stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Pro men jumping all over each other.  Okay.  Terrific.  107.  WNEW.  And a lot of people ask, where did the OK Terrific come from, Anthony?  Yeah.  It came from that little sweeper you just heard. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  Jimmy put that together.  He puts like hundreds of those together for our show.  Yeah.  We just casually threw it on the radio.  Didn't think much of it.  And then all of a sudden, everyone starts saying, okay, terrific.  Okay.  Terrific.  Where is he?  There he is.  Ah!  That ain't it.  I just scared myself of you getting shot.  Okay.  Terrific.  I'm running.  Wow.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, no.  Retard on family double dare.  What is that?  Come on, people.  We had to dump out of the show.  Let's go to Daniel.  Daniel, what's going on?  Yeah.  I was just flipping through the channels, and I go to, and I'm just like flipping through,  and I see Nickelodeon as family double dare.  So, of course, I just sit down and I watch like four or five minutes of it.  And so, they got this girl, and we didn't, like, know it at first that she was retarded. 
[02:06:30]  But they said Special Olympics, and my brother and I just looked at each other, cracked up.  And she was trying to get through that same obstacle course at the end.  Oh, no.  And it was just so funny.  Oh, you cool, man.  Because, like, everyone else was, like, diving.  It was just, like, trying to walk.  Oh.  It was hysterical.  What are they doing that for?  That's too much pressure for the retarded.  Yeah, I know.  It's not right.  You know, like, the Special Olympics, they're pretty easy, right? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  You know, it's like you run a race.  You point them in a straight line, and then run.  I actually got a little joke for you guys.  Yeah.  What's better than winning gold at the Special Olympics?  Not being retarded.  Walking.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dan.  All right.  Syndication when Spaz uses 8% of his brain.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  But it's like something like Family Double Dare.  You ever watch that show?  It's a little too confusing.  It's hard enough for people of normal intelligence to get through those obstacle courses, and then 
[02:07:30]  the host is, like, going, okay, now this one, now, grab the flag, grab the flag.  Can you imagine a poor, retarded kid trying to get through that?  Yeah.  I know it's not politically correct, but you see, you know, a retarded kid doing that on  TV.  Yeah.  I hate to say it.  You're going to laugh.  Yeah, you are.  I mean, people want to make believe that we're all mature enough not to laugh and watch it  for what it is and stuff, but the fact is you're just opening yourself to be laughed  at.  That is horrible. 
[02:08:00]  I know that's really harsh, but that's the truth, right?  Who in their right mind watches something like that and goes, oh, isn't that wonderful?  Yeah.  Isn't that wonderful?  Look at that.  What a, what a courageous moment that is.  You're laughing.  It's wrong, but you're laughing.  Yeah.  That's probably why they put him on.  Come on!  Oh, yes, Jimmy.  Let him out!  Let him out!  Come on!  All right, Ant.  Quick break.  We'll be back.  Train, train, train. 
[02:08:30]  What's that, Ant?  What's that, Ant?  What's that, Ant?  O.B. and Anthony, 1027 WNEW. </pre>
