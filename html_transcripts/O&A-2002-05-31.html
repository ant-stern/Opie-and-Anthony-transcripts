<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with Anthony enduring intense ribbing from Opie about a severe sunburn sustained during a trip to Fire Island and the Hamptons.  Graphic descriptions of the sunburn ensue, along with discussions of home remedies and jokes targeting Fire Island's gay community, although Anthony clarifies he wasn't in a predominantly gay area.  The conversation then pivots to recent rumors of a show suspension.  Opie and Anthony vehemently deny being suspended for criticizing Don and Mike, instead attributing their absence to Opie's grandmother's death and his father's subsequent hospitalization. Opie emotionally recounts these events, and program director Jeremy Coleman calls in to confirm the absence wasn't a suspension. Opie accuses Don and Mike of exploiting his family tragedy for career advancement, offering to write Don DiBella a check if he's that financially strapped.

The show then meanders through various topics, including a critical, humorous review of *Spider-Man* (with a joke about Jimmy Norton’s supposed appearance), a scathing critique of *Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones*, and a discussion of the hosts' movie preferences, revealing a strong preference for older films.  The segment concludes with more humorous banter about Opie's recent home décor purchases, leading to jokes about his perceived "faggotry."

A lengthy discussion follows about bedding – bed skirts, comforters, and duvets – punctuated by Opie's frustrating encounter with a bed skirt's adhesive.  This transitions into a detailed promotion of the upcoming Opie and Anthony softball game at Riverfront Stadium in Newark, expected to draw approximately 8,000 attendees.  The hosts highlight the $25,000 Sonic Blue softball throw contest, Frenchy's dunking booth, an Octane performance, and the Air Force's sponsorship of Stalker Patty's head-shaving. Several phone calls are interspersed throughout: Ken updates on his "wow sticker stops"; Ryan/Brian has a hilarious mix-up, simultaneously listening to the show and being on the air; Jason Kidd’s reaction to Boston fans is discussed; a 12-year-old Gary, despite receiving tickets from Opie, is called out for badmouthing him on another show; Tom from New Orleans cancels his appearance due to illness, leading to Blind Dave being selected as the first-pitch thrower; and Devin, Macaulay Culkin's brother, backs out of sponsoring Stalker Patty's head-shaving.

The softball team draft dominates a substantial portion of the broadcast.  Jamaica Mike, Paul Mercurio (whose sunburn becomes a recurring joke), Jeff Norris, Rick, Eddie Trunk, and Joey Paisano are among the players drafted, with much joking and insults targeted at their physiques, playing abilities, and ethnicities.  The absence of "Old Dirty" sparks speculation and jokes. Paul the Pilot calls in, offering his services and recounting a humorous anecdote involving the FBI. Keith the Cop, Rick Cerrone (whose seriousness is questioned), and Steve C are also drafted.  Cowbell Bill's recent engagement is also joked about. The draft includes contentious negotiations between Opie and Anthony over players like Frenchy and Devin, marked by homophobic slurs.  Scott Pharrell describes the lively pre-game party. A caller's comment on Jason Kidd's son's large head sparks a lengthy, graphic digression, replete with offensive comparisons and anecdotes.  The "6 o'clock queep" song is performed with a caller, and several callers leave "F.U." messages for Don and Mike.

A significant portion focuses on relentless, crude jokes aimed at Devin's abnormally large head, with numerous callers contributing to the escalating gag. Technical difficulties are briefly mentioned, alongside reminders of upcoming events: a handball tournament, the softball game, and a music performance. Jim Norton's supposed lack of pop culture knowledge versus his extensive Bath & Body Works product knowledge is also contrasted humorously.  The show concludes with continued jokes about Devin’s head and announcements of upcoming events, including a potential nuclear war joke.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I like this deal. You just, you come in, and you got one day of work. One day. And then, it's the weekend. So what, at, uh, I guess at about 5 o'clock, that'll be our hump day. It's our hump day at 5.  Well, it's good to be back. How are you, my friend?  I'm doing great, Anthony.  We're, uh, we're back.  Yeah, it's been a long, long week.  Yes, yes it has.  Where do we begin? 
[00:00:30]  Don't start with my sunburn.  You're making us all uncomfortable, first of all.  I'm sorry, I'm very, I'm very burnt.  Anthony has probably the worst sunburn I've ever seen on a human being.  No, it's not that bad.  How about some aloe, bro?  I don't want, is there aloe in it?  Your, your face is so red, it's sweating, it's sweating.  No, it's moisture just falling out of your pores.  See, I thought, uh, because I was Sicilian, I had a little bit of that colored in me.  You know, like everyone says, and I wouldn't have gotten the sunburn. 
[00:01:00]  But, um, I, I, I went out to Fire Island, and I got the sunburn open.  But you're, you were, uh, sitting in the office, making believe it doesn't hurt.  We all know it hurts.  It doesn't hurt.  You're making everyone around you uncomfortable.  It's just a little tight.  It's a little tight.  I used some of that solar cane on it.  I like the optimism, but you just look just like you're in a lot of pain.  A little tight.  I got a, I got a nice sunburn remedy. 
[00:01:30]  What, what is that?  That, uh...  Now, you're a fair guy.  It looks like, uh, you probably have had your share of sunburn once or twice.  I guarantee I'm going to have lots and lots of skin cancer.  Caddy?  Well, unfortunately, I'm going to.  I caddy for 15 years.  Caddy.  Winning that caddy tournament.  I grew up, uh, pretty much in Waiting River at my grandma's house, getting burnt over  and over again, summer after summer.  My parents didn't, uh, believe in, uh, suntan lotion.  No.  Uh, we would come back to, to Centerport after our weekend out in, uh, Waiting River.  And my dad would, uh, would, uh, take the sting out of the sunburn with vinegar. 
[00:02:00]  That doesn't even sound, that sounds like abuse.  That was his home remedy.  The cold, white vinegar.  He would just smear all over our, our burnt bodies.  So you ran around smelling like a douche?  Pretty much.  If you're going to be a douche, you might as well look like one.  And smell like one.  So, uh, I guess that's the first thing I want to say is that, uh, it just looks awful.  Well, it's, uh, I'm going to. 
[00:02:30]  And, you know, I give you a lot of credit for the optimism and stuff, but I just want  you to admit sometime today that you're suffering.  It's going to be a little tight.  I got to, I got to move around a little.  You're Sicilian, bro.  Now, I know, that's what I thought.  I thought.  Then he goes to me, well, it was a little overcast yesterday.  You know how they, what they say about overcast skies.  You know, the overcast skies.  You get a worse burn than on the sunny days, Jimmy.  That's what they say.  You know, I know why you don't want to admit it, because then you know it's going to hurt 
[00:03:00]  even more and it's going to get redder.  The one thing you did say in the back office is like, yeah, well, I noticed like, uh, halfway  through the afternoon that I was getting a little red and that maybe I should put something  on it.  So maybe I should put a little something on it.  When you notice you're red in the sun, it's already way.  I know, so I put some on then and I'm still pretty red.  Walk it off, Dick.  That's what I did.  I'm walking it off.  You know what helps, actually?  A little splash of mule juice on the face.  I tend to take the stick right out of that.  Jimmy, by the way, all the gay jokes are coming in because Fire Island is known for its gay 
[00:03:30]  sections.  Well, not Watch Hill.  Yeah, Watch Hill.  I was out of Watch Hill and it wasn't a Cherry Grove taken in the keister.  That's just Watch Hill suck it.  That's what that is.  No, not Watch Hill suck it.  No.  Watch Hill suck it.  No.  If you know anything about Long Island, there's Watch Hill and Davis Park, which you take the  ferry over there and you have a good time. 
[00:04:00]  And if you go to places like Cherry Grove.  Shut up.  Oh, I better put this lotion in.  Brad, Brad, could you rub this on my back and then put the lotion on?  No.  You can act like a man.  I'm trying.  Oh, don't slap me.  I got sunburned.  You can just.  No.  No, stop it.  We're not going to play music. 
[00:04:30]  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  We're not.  That's enough with the music today, please.  I just want to put little rubber bands around your hands and then brutalize your keister.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  No.  We told you guys.  It's not a gay area.  Don't worry about it.  Now, Watch Hill, it's a nice place to go.  Jeez.  It's beautiful.  Very relaxing.  You got the miles of beaches to yourself.  Right?  Because there's no real cars or anything in Watch Hill.  Right, Anthony?  Right.  You got to take the boat off. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, stop it.  And this is how I was dancing.  I just went out because we had some time away.  Right.  Time away from the show.  Yeah, obviously.  So I went to the beach.  Obviously, we want to let you in on some things, but the sunburn thing is a distraction, Anthony. 
[00:05:30]  Well, I'm sorry that it's distracting you.  It's distracting everybody.  So where do we begin today?  Well, we weren't on the air.  We haven't been on the air in a week.  In a week.  In a week.  Yeah, we haven't.  Everyone has been speculating.  Everyone.  We had, I guess, a week ago, Thursday, we were on the air.  And then we took Friday off.  Right? 
[00:06:00]  We took Friday off, right?  Yeah, we took Friday off.  And on Friday, we were bludgeoned with personal insults by Don and Mike.  Can I tell you something?  Yes, I'll tell you this much so far.  We weren't planning on taking Friday off, okay?  That is the truth.  We were going to take Monday off because it was Memorial Day, Anthony.  Of course.  And we certainly weren't going to take off Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week,  especially because we have a huge softball game tomorrow.  A sold-out game in Newark at Riverfront Stadium there.  We're going to have a ball tomorrow.  So why would we take a whole week off before a big event? 
[00:06:30]  We still have to pick our goddamn teams.  Yeah, we got a lot to do today.  We got a lot of stuff that we have to get to today that we would have liked to have gotten to last week.  Right.  So continue.  Well, we had that Friday off where we were bludgeoned personal insults and whatnot.  By the show before us here in New York, Dynamite.  Right, right, right.  A show that, for the other people in the country that have no clue, quite frankly, just failed miserably in New York City. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  I mean, they could spin it any way they want.  The official thing is they're now blaming us because they failed in New York.  That's what I read in the paper anyway.  So they're blaming us, whatever.  But the fact of the matter is they failed miserably.  Yeah.  Miserably.  Here in New York.  And apparently that got the show very angry.  And they lashed out.  So they decided to do a whole show bashing us on Friday.  Just bashing us.  Knowing, by the way, that we would not be on the air Friday. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  And we'll get into that in a little bit.  Knowing that we weren't going to be here.  Weren't going to be on the air Friday.  And claiming that we were pussies.  Right.  That was the word that was used.  We were pussies.  We were pussies for taking the day off.  Yeah.  And not fighting back.  There you go.  And then claiming that we're so rich that we decided to take a long weekend and go to the Hamptons, Anthony.  Well, that's where I burnt, Opie.  I burnt out there in the Hamptons.  Just more...  My rich friends.  Just more stupid lies. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  There were a lot of lies going on on that Friday show.  Then the weekend, the Memorial Day weekend happened.  And then Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, you and I have been off the radio.  Yeah.  And it's been reported in the Washington Post, in all the radio websites, the trade magazines.  Everyone is reporting that you and I were suspended from our radio show for talking about an inferior radio show. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Look at the headline there.  Let me make this perfectly clear to the Washington Post, R&R Online, Inside Radio, FMQB, Radio Inc.  The only one that got the story correct is a guy we really don't like, but you know what?  He did some journalism.  He did some investigating.  And you know what?  He got it right.  Didn't just talk to Don.  Right.  David Hinckley of the Daily News got it right.  He didn't write that we got suspended.  Matter of fact, he has a quote, and Finney's spokesman said, Opie and Anthony, we're not suspended. 
[00:09:00]  There you go.  But we're just not on the air this week.  That is the truth.  We were not suspended for talking about an inferior radio show.  We would never get suspended for talking about an inferior radio show, ever.  Right.  The company would never, ever do that to you and I.  Never.  You know, we've had some problems with another show in this company.  Yeah, we could possibly get suspended over that.  But not for talking about an inferior radio show. 
[00:09:30]  Well.  So you got that wrong.  Washington Post and everyone else.  Washington Post apparently only spoke to Don from what I get.  No one talked to me as I was getting burnt on the beach.  Can we get Jeremy on the phone?  I want an official word.  I want an official statement that we were not suspended for talking about an inferior radio show.  He's in the studio.  Jeremy Coleman, the program director of WNEW here.  There it is. 
[00:10:00]  You were absolutely not suspended.  There you go.  Now, who from WNEW, as I read in this, said that we had been taken off the air because of what was going on last week?  I have no idea.  I don't think anyone did.  No one called me.  So somebody just took it upon themselves to either write a lie or just lie in WNEW's name here in New York.  There you go.  All right.  So we were not suspended. 
[00:10:30]  Not suspended.  Absolutely not.  Yeah.  From the mouth of Jeremy Coleman.  So you might say, you know, all right, you wanted to be on the air.  You had things to do.  And you weren't suspended.  You were not suspended.  Well then, Opie, what?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why do you?  What?  Well, this is going to be...  Divorce court?  This is going to be a little tough to say.  Mm-hmm.  But the truth of the matter, and I got to tell you, this is something that has been going on for about two to two and a half weeks, Anthony. 
[00:11:00]  Everyone, and I mean everyone associated with this radio station in New York, WNEW, was in on it and knew exactly what was going on in my personal life.  Right.  All right, and Don decided to, I don't know, in my opinion, take advantage of the fact that I was having personal problems and spin it, spin it in a way to kind of help his career.  Now, you're taking the AZT and the AIDS is in remission. 
[00:11:30]  What?  No?  Oh, that was something.  I'm sorry.  Don DiBella is so desperate that he decided that he needs to spin it in a way where he's going to get pressed for his stupid radio show.  If he's that desperate and needs money that bad, I will write a check to him personally.  Because now he's just showing how effing pathetic he is, okay?  The fact of the matter is someone that I cared a real lot about died. 
[00:12:00]  My grandmother, who pretty much helped raise me.  And I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, but I will tell you this.  The reason I wasn't here last Friday was because I was in a hospital room in Syosset watching my grandma die.  And it was the grandmother that was left, that you had left, because you had talked in the past about the other grandmother.  Oh, who I hated.  Which you did not like, but this was a very loved relative.  Big time. 
[00:12:30]  She had seven kids, 27 grandkids, 14 great-grandkids.  And the woman that never hurt a soul, she was the glue that held my family together.  She helped raise me.  I mentioned in the beginning of the show that we had that house in Waiting River.  That was where you used to have these sugar and margarine sandwiches?  Well, my uncles corrected me at the wake, saying, look, man, we didn't have margarine, it was butter.  Oh, hey, hey.  Well, my grandma's sleep on the old burlap cots. 
[00:13:00]  It was the wool blankets and the sand, yes, with the sunburn.  With your sunburn.  I pretty much spent my childhood at my grandma's house in Waiting River.  It was like the poor man's version of the Kennedy compound, Anthony.  Where it was all, I mean, our entire family there, every weekend, every summer from the age of, I don't know, when I was crawling until I was like 28, we had the house.  Like the Kennedy compound, did you play football?  All that stuff.  On the lawn?  Did you beat women over the head with golf clubs until they were dead? 
[00:13:30]  Football.  Damn, I suck.  Football, wiffle ball, fishing, water, I mean, everything.  Sex with Marilyn Monroe, all the fun Kennedy things.  Sure, you may have driven home drunk a few times and left a girl in a river.  Who cares?  It was family and you were there with them all.  It was the poor man's version of the Kennedy compound, Billy.  Did your Uncle Ted run around with no pants?  Oh, we didn't care.  Well, we had an Uncle Ted, more or less. 
[00:14:00]  I'll let my uncles try to figure out which one's Uncle Ted.  But that's the truth.  I mean, Thursday was my birthday.  And then Friday, I went to a hospital and pretty much watched my grandma die all weekend long  while everyone else was doing what you do for Memorial Day.  You know, the picnics and the barbecues and going to the beaches and stuff.  I was sitting in a hospital room with all of my relatives pretty much off and on for three days.  Right.  Okay?  And that is the fact.  And I can't believe I have to even, you know, say this on the radio to prove to these idiots in the press that we were not suspended. 
[00:14:30]  Okay?  My grandma's sickness came on real fast.  It was unexpected.  I mean, she was 92 years old.  She had a great, great life.  But it was still a sad thing.  92?  It came out of nowhere and she died of double pneumonia.  Helen Hughes, my grandma.  Okay?  Yeah.  And then she died.  This is where it gets even better.  Better?  Well, whatever.  John from Buffalo is saying play. 
[00:15:00]  John from Buffalo actually put a couple of asterisks up on the screen and then put plays laugh track in between.  See, the listeners are just as cruel as we are.  That's all right.  I'm not going to like, you know.  Just as goddamn cruel as we are.  Well, like I said, I'm not looking for sympathy.  Of course.  I'm just stating facts.  It's part of life.  I know I've done some, you know, douchey things on this radio show, so I'm not going to turn around today and look for sympathy.  Trust me.  But my grandma was unbelievable to me. 
[00:15:30]  She took the place of the witch of a mother my mom had.  I don't even call her a grandma.  When she died, we didn't even, you know, we didn't even miss a beat, man.  She was the one.  We just kept going.  The nasty one was the one that called you precious.  Precious.  And I told her, I told my mom I'd wait in the car and that was the last words.  Right.  My other quote, even though she's never been considered a grandma in my eyes, that was the last thing she ever heard.  Right.  But this grandma took the place of that grandma and my two grandpas that I never, you know, never got to hang with.  Yeah.  Okay?  So, with my grandma pretty much fading fast, my dad started getting chest pains. 
[00:16:00]  And if you've been listening to the show a while, you know my dad has some pretty serious heart crap going on for the last 10, 12 years.  He's been okay so far.  But he had some chest pains.  So then, he's at the VA hospital in Northport.  So, this is what I was doing Memorial Day while everyone else was spinning it and saying we were suspended because an inferior radio show, you know, thinks they're as good as us. 
[00:16:30]  Trying to get their name in the press alongside us.  So, my father is in the VA hospital in Northport with the chest pains and he's hooked up to all his equipment and tubes and stuff.  And that was Saturday night, okay?  Our whole family had to go to the VA hospital in Northport on Monday, Monday morning, because we were scared.  We didn't know what was going to happen, you know, because of the condition my dad was in at the time.  And tell him that his mom died while he's hooked up to the tubes, okay? 
[00:17:00]  Nasty.  And then, you know, to get out of this crap, then, you know, we had the wake Tuesday and Wednesday.  And then we had the funeral yesterday.  And that's the reason why we weren't on the air.  Yeah.  We were not suspended.  Would have been nice to have come on and done our show.  You know, and I will not even deal with fat and fatter in their lives anymore.  You know, I haven't been in the game for about two and a half weeks because of this crap going on. 
[00:17:30]  But if you want to fight, you got one.  And I'll tell you right now, Ant and I have never, ever, ever lost.  Ever.  There you go.  Don't back down.  We have never, ever lost.  Won't sit here and play music.  But it's pretty pathetic that you're a part of this radio station in New York.  You knew damn well what was going on.  Everyone else did.  Yeah.  You know, they'll claim, oh, we didn't know.  And then spin it to, you know, in your favor to possibly help your situation or help your career. 
[00:18:00]  If you need a check that bad, send me a bill.  I'll write you a check.  Don DeBella.  Spattering of people on instant feedback.  Like, um, a couple of these people.  What's the matter?  Truth hurts.  That's what we're telling you here.  That's what happened.  That's it.  God, I mean...  Well, what happened?  There's nothing.  There's no big other story here.  What do you want proof?  I'll tell you the plot. 
[00:18:30]  You can go see the fresh dirt, you asses.  The obituary was in Newsday.  Helen Hughes, 92 years old.  I don't have to make it so morbid.  But it was a rough, rough week.  I mean, I'm cool with everything.  Yeah.  Real fast.  But to see, like, my sisters and my relatives just completely just...  Well, that's the hardest part.  Completely just breaking down to the point they can't walk. 
[00:19:00]  I mean, it was just brutal.  And I've been lucky.  I haven't had to deal with anything like this in my life before.  Mm-hmm.  And I don't want to deal with it anytime soon.  No, it's not a fun thing.  And it would have been a lot more fun to be on the air and pick our teams.  Now we've got to do this all in one day.  We're going to have fun.  We're going to turn the corner here and we're going to move on.  We're going to try to sing a row.  It's just...  Let's just stick with me.  We're going to get through this and we'll turn this thing around.  We're going to get through this, though.  We've just got to keep your chin up. 
[00:19:30]  But we're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Wow.  And there you go.  There's the facts.  Hmm.  What?  Tell us what, Bob.  I don't know.  We're pussies?  Hmm.  Why are we pussies?  Interesting.  Okay.  Why are we pussies?  All right.  There you go.  And to be honest, I didn't even really get to...  I didn't hear what they had to say on Friday.  I was too busy doing other things.  So, I was on the Hamptons.  I had my chopper take me over there, land me on the helipad. 
[00:20:00]  Then I got out.  I went to my dermatologist.  I got some Accutane, because that's what I do.  And then I hopped in the jet and went out to the Hamptons.  You know, everything that's gone on in my life, hoping, all that's happened and the way it is now, I'm very happy with things.  There's one hurdle I have not been able to get over, and that is I cannot be complete as a person until overweight men find me attractive. 
[00:20:30]  And until that happens, I'm at a loss.  I'm at a loss.  Sure, I have a great gig here.  I have a beautiful 12-year-old girlfriend.  But until fat men find me attractive, I don't care about anything else.  But until fat men can look at me and not criticize my looks, until I will not feel good, until they find me attractive, it's just a hurdle. 
[00:21:00]  It's a cross I have to bear.  And there's one other thing you have not accomplished, by the way.  Yes, yes.  You have not yet made the biggest move of your radio career and fallen on your face.  You have not made a huge move, which got you all excited and ready to take on the world, and been rejected and failed miserably.  That's true.  You have not done that.  You're absolutely right.  Unfortunately, you are a tremendous success in New York City. 
[00:21:30]  But I have this empty spot, this hole in my person.  I can't feel complete, no matter how, you know, the women, the show, the this, the, it's nothing to me, until Don finds me attractive.  Well, the important thing is, Don DiBella.  Does your girlfriend have a younger sister you can hook me up with?  And my name is Greg.  My name is Greg.  I understand.  I guess they blew that for me on Friday.  Well, Greg.  In case you didn't know.  Yes, Greg? 
[00:22:00]  Heavens to Betsy.  Greg Hughes.  Yes?  That's my name.  Wow.  Sorry, Joe.  So, unlike the bitter twins, fat and fatter, Don DiBella and his sidekick there, we're going to do a real radio show today.  Going to have some fun today, put on some entertainment, not just sit around and play songs and wine, nothing like that.  Going to have some fun.  We're going to pick our goddamn teams for tomorrow's game.  Weather, by the way, is supposed to be beautiful. 
[00:22:30]  Thank God, because it's going to rain like a mother today.  We're knocking wood.  That frontal system back off.  I agree.  I agree.  Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  All right.  It's going to be perfect weather and going to have a good time.  So, once again, we were not suspended.  There you go.  I think that's pretty obvious to everyone.  There.  All right.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  At the last supper, they would have wiped their asses with the tablecloth. 
[00:23:00]  That's just what Christ wanted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  Live, finally.  May 31st.  You have to say that, because I was listening to Best Of, and it sounded like we were live.  Yeah.  Then we're talking about, like, Christmas or something.  Korn here to stay.  Don't forget, Korn is playing the Hammerstein Ballroom, June 11th.  There you go.  That's going to be a great, great show. 
[00:23:30]  Whoa, what's wrong?  What happened?  Why is everyone laughing?  That was supposed to be a secret?  Oops.  You'll hear that announced.  I can't rock that, too.  That's a secret?  Oh.  See, Opie.  I don't know.  We've been gone a week.  Look at Earl laughing.  Earl's listening to my head.  What's the secret?  That Korn's playing June 11th at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  Oh.  Hey, I bet you start hearing it being announced real quick, like in about five minutes. 
[00:24:00]  Whoa.  Wow.  Oops.  That ought to be cold, though.  That's great.  Why hold that information from your listeners, man?  I don't know.  I knew about that a week ago.  Why is Earl, like...  Did you learn it by the skateboard stand?  Oh, my.  I agree with that.  Yeah, we hear a lot of things first at the skateboard stand.  That's where all the new hip news comes to first.  All us older dudes trying to look young.  Love you, Opie. 
[00:24:30]  Love you, Anthony.  Yeah.  Love you, too, Jimmy.  I can't help it that I keep myself in shape and don't look my age.  I'll say.  Jesus.  A couple phone numbers, Anthony, in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Buffalo.  Buffalo, New York.  Yes.  Buffalo.  Thank you.  Buffalo gave us a nice little bump.  A nice little bump up in the ratings.  So thank you, Buffalo.  866-277-4-WOW.  866-277-4-WOW. 
[00:25:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  I got to catch Spider-Man.  I saw Spider-Man.  And Star Wars.  During our little time off.  I went to see Spider-Man as a little distraction.  Mm-hmm.  That was a good movie, man.  Damn good movie, Spider-Man.  It was all right.  Story was cool.  Looked good.  Did you see where Spider-Man swung right by our building here?  I did.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He takes a left at Duane Reade, right?  Yeah.  He takes a left onto Broadway off of 57th on his web. 
[00:25:30]  I got to see it.  And goes flying by the building, their building here.  Yeah.  On 56th Street.  And then when Jimmy hits the screen, it's just the funniest guy.  Were you getting all nervous during those clips?  I was like, oh, no, here comes Jimmy.  Here comes Jimmy.  Here comes Jimmy.  You look good, dude.  It's three seconds.  It's your catchphrase, you know?  I haven't seen it.  I got to go.  I got to tell you.  I can't get a date.  Who's in love with Kirsten Dunn?  Spider-Man?  Oh, you mean like everybody?  Well, yeah, but Spider-Man blew her off at the end because he's got more important things  in life to do. 
[00:26:00]  He's got to fight these villains.  Right.  I don't need to see it.  Don't worry.  Everyone who's going to see Spider-Man has seen it.  Does he leave a little web on her back?  Jerks his arm.  Spitting web out the window.  I was loving the fact that they were just exploiting her boobs, man.  Her cannage.  Here's her boobs in a low Cleveland top.  Here's her boobs in a tight sweater.  Here's her boobs in a wet T-shirt. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, the wet T-shirt one was good when she was ready to get gang raped in the alley.  Come on.  Who's kidding who?  That's what was going on there.  Yeah.  They weren't looking for her wallet.  No.  And they're ready to gang rape her and, of course, Spider-Man right there.  Right there to help her out.  Right.  I had a problem with the Halloween mask, though.  What do you mean?  The Green Goblin and Spidey there.  Looked like they were just kind of wearing Halloween masks.  I don't know.  The Spider-Man mask is cool. 
[00:27:00]  It's cool.  Those eyes.  It's Spider-Man, though.  You can't change that.  No.  But, I mean, Willem.  Willem.  Willem Dafoe.  Not William.  It's Willem.  Willem.  Willem Dafoe.  He's got some of the greatest facial expressions in Hollywood.  Oh, he's twisted, yeah.  And he's behind that Halloween mask for half the movie.  Well, yeah, but he's the Green Goblin.  I mean, it was cool.  The first time you saw the mask, you're like, wow, that's cool.  I think they were trying to do a Scream thing.  I think in the movie Scream, the mask worked without any real features moving and stuff.  Because, you know, he's hiding behind the mask. 
[00:27:30]  But in this, I think you need a little more expressions there.  A little mechanical moving face or something?  It was pretty good, though.  Special effects were really good.  That's my only critique, and it's a tiny one.  I just wanted to see a little more.  And how about the much you mean?  When he came, that was a very funny scene.  Bruce Campbell in the ring, actually naming Spider-Man as the amazing Spider-Man.  Right.  He wanted to be called the human spider.  The human spider, right. 
[00:28:00]  The human spider.  That ain't working.  The amazing Spider-Man.  He comes out, and that was another funny thing.  When he drew up with a costume that he wanted, and he says, okay, this is how I want my Spider-Man costume to look for the wrestling thing.  And you thought that Kurt was going to open up.  And if he was in the regular Spider-Man suit, I'd be like, all right, where'd he get that?  But he's in some lame sweatshirt with a spider drawn on it and a black magic marker.  And little things like that were very, very good in the movie.  I liked it.  I kind of miss the Macho Man now.  The Macho Man.  He was all right. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Hey, come down from there.  That was very good.  And then I saw...  Hold on.  Can I...  Before you...  Oh, oh, oh.  No, I just want to give a call out to Uncle John.  Oh.  I have to ask Uncle John something.  He's a regular caller on our radio show.  I just have a question to ask him, okay?  I don't think...  I know what you're going to ask him, and I don't think so.  I'll tell everyone else.  It's not that big of a secret.  I think Uncle John was in Spider-Man.  But Jimmy's in Spider-Man.  Maybe he didn't want to blow up your spot. 
[00:29:00]  Maybe Dan from Hoboken's in Spider-Man 2.  Earl made an appearance.  There was a guy, you know, when they were doing the...  You know, asking people on the street what they thought of Spider-Man,  and Jim Norton does a fine job.  They were talking to, like, guys overlooking the water behind them,  and I think one of them was Uncle John.  Really?  Looked like him a little bit and sounded like him a little bit.  During those same things where they were getting people's response to Spider-Man?  That could be way off, but...  Yeah?  Yeah.  He'll probably call in.  But go ahead.  I just think he would have said something before now. 
[00:29:30]  After all the Spider-Man talk we did with Jimmy being in there.  That's what I'm thinking, that he would have said something.  So, I guess not.  But this guy sounded and looked like him.  Anyway, go ahead.  Revenge.  Attack of the Clones.  Ooh.  Attack of the Clones.  I still haven't seen that.  You haven't seen that yet?  No.  I won't ruin anything for you.  I'm not going to give away storylines.  Oh, boy.  The thing is, with a prequel, you can't ruin it because you know it's going to happen anyway.  I couldn't stand how it was cast. 
[00:30:00]  That kid that's playing Anakin now is like a Dawson's Creek reject.  You don't need that.  You need just some guy in there, some kid in there to play the part.  And I'm just a beast.  Like, his acting, first of all, wasn't even good.  And then he comes off like a WB series actor.  A little lousy.  I'm trying to do that love thing with him and Senator Amidala now. 
[00:30:30]  She's not the little queen anymore.  Yeah, Natalie Portman.  Who, besides being very flat-chested, got a pretty good bod in there.  When they're tied up in that arena and she's got the white pants on.  We have topless shots.  We have topless shots of her on foundrymusic.com.  Oh, how about that?  They're not that small.  Maybe they were squished pretty good in that white shirt of hers.  She's got some nice bees.  All right.  Some full bees.  It didn't look that way, squished in the shirt.  But she had a nice ass on when her arms were above her head and she's hanging from that pole. 
[00:31:00]  Hanging from the pole.  And then where Lucas could have come across and helped out with the way it was ruined.  The first episode that they just did.  What the hell was that one called?  The Phantom Menace.  Oh, yeah.  Because that was a kid movie.  You know, you call it what you want.  It was a kid movie.  Oh, look, I'm racing in a speeder.  A little kid.  The pod.  They could have made this different.  They could have made it a little more hard-edged by showing anecdotes. 
[00:31:30]  I can really get into the dark side.  But they kind of glaze over it.  At one point, his mom, some episode with his mom.  I'm not going to get into a whole bunch of things.  But he got very angry and went to take revenge on some people.  And the revenge was like nothing.  A couple of swings of a lightsaber.  He goes back to Amidala there and says,  Oh, I did this and that.  And tells how awful it was what he did to people.  Show it, first of all.  Show him losing his mind.  Show him going, oh, wait, now this explains it. 
[00:32:00]  Okay.  Now he turns out to be Darth Vader.  It's important to the story.  Yeah.  Millions and millions and millions of people.  But no, they glaze over it because, oh, they want to keep the cute Dawson's Creek  friggin' marketability of the action figures.  Make it dark.  Make it evil the way it's supposed to be.  The effects were great.  I'll give them that.  Man, when you see the Yoda in this and then you go back and look at that god-awful puppet  in the first one. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, my God.  It's all CGI.  And his face is moving.  His eyebrows and everything.  And then you look at the first trilogy they did with that stupid puppet.  It's like a Muppet.  Yeah.  Trying to walk on the cane.  And then he's walking on his cane and then two seconds later he's kicking ass with a  lightsaber.  Pretty cool stuff.  Little Yoda.  Little Yoda flying up in the air with a lightsaber.  The effects were good.  Storyline left me with nothing.  Well, you know what?  You know what?  We've got to stop you there.  Why?  The effects in every movie that comes out today is good. 
[00:33:00]  Sure.  Yeah, but it was...  They have figured that out.  You know something?  The computer has really figured that out.  The Phantom Menace, I was kind of, eh, you know, except for the pod race thing.  The pod race was really cool.  The rest of it was like, eh, I don't like the Mercury ships all the time.  I think they...  And that one, the Phantom Menace, was all that, like, sleek, shiny ship thing.  Right.  I like the ones at the end when they're pulling off the planet.  They have figured out their special effects.  They need more stories now.  Better stories in the movies. 
[00:33:30]  Mm-hmm.  But so you didn't like...  It was...  I didn't leave with any, like, wow, that was really cool or anything.  You know?  It didn't really do much.  I'm counting on the next one now, which in order for...  Remember the first one that they made, which was actually episode four?  You know, in order for the galaxy that they're in to be in that bad a shape,  where now the Empire rules everything, the Jedi are pretty much wiped out,  and the Rebellion is just a small little mass of people, 
[00:34:00]  something really bad has to happen in this third installment.  Has to.  It can't be this happy movie.  It turns out, if you look at the goddamn first one they did, you know,  he'll F it up somehow.  True.  Yeah.  He'll make it cute and cuddly.  He'll make it cute.  Now, after the third one, is he going to redo the other ones?  No.  The rumor is...  There will be...  It will be...  Redo it with new actors and everything.  Hmm.  I'm thinking Samuel L. Jackson there. 
[00:34:30]  Samuel L. Jackson.  Doing a little Darth Vader.  I don't know.  Indiana Jones 4.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, that was announced.  There will be an Indiana Jones 4.  Oh, stop.  Why would you go to see Star Wars?  Lucas has not done a good movie, and after the Empire Strikes Back, I didn't like anything.  Because it's Star Wars.  You know, Jim, shut up.  I wouldn't go.  Jim, because it's Star Wars.  Did you go see the Pantheon Manic?  No.  So how do you know it sucks?  Because everyone I've talked to who I respect, it's stuck.  It's not like you've got to mortgage your house and spend six years watching it. 
[00:35:00]  It's a few bucks.  You lay it down a couple of hours to, you know, continue the story.  I respect your opinion.  George Lucas, first of all, he has a worse shit than I do.  How can you talk about a movie you never saw?  Because, look, I've also never stuck my...  Don't listen to other critics to begin with.  All right.  I never stuck my mule in a toaster, but I know it's not pleasant.  All right.  There you go.  You don't have to do any...  I mean, if 50 people said it stunk and it was cutesy, then I'm going to see...  Okay.  Yeah.  One guy I heard over talking...  What have you heard of Jar Jar Binks? 
[00:35:30]  He's horrible.  The only thing I want to see is because he really annoyed some people because he thought  it was a stereotype.  So that I kind of respect.  But it was typical, you know, coddling to stupid kids with little cute puppies.  That's what I don't like.  I don't like the idea that it's a kiddie movie.  I agree.  A bunch of kids.  Love you, Ben.  Love you, Steve.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  How could you say that she didn't have a rack and she was flat-chested in that movie, man?  When she was wearing a tight shirt, she looked good.  It didn't look like she had much. 
[00:36:00]  That's all I'm saying.  I didn't say she did or didn't, but it was very...  They were very pushed in.  Yeah, they were pushed in, but especially in that battle scene at the end when she got  her shirt ripped off and ripped her in half.  And she looked good.  And did you catch that other part in the movie, too?  I'm giving her the ass.  What are you talking about?  Well, the ass looked good.  The boobs looked good.  But what about that other part in the movie?  You're not going to do this, sir.  It was worth a shot.  Good day, guys.  All right.  He was trying to get me, LP. 
[00:36:30]  I sensed it.  I used the force.  How come no one can use the force and sense that this film is going to suck before they  go see it?  It wasn't bad.  I'm not saying it was bad.  I'm saying it just wasn't this big, good thing.  How do you not concentrate on Darth Vader?  How do you not...  That's one of the best villains ever in film.  Right.  And so far, we got a cute kid, little kid on his pod raiser.  And now we got this Dawson's Creek reject who's whining, whining at every turn.  Hey, man. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, Obi-Wan doesn't believe in me.  Hey, baby, baby.  Shut up and kill a lot of things.  That's what he should be doing.  He's at that vulnerable stage where it's going to affect his whole mind and turn him into  this Darth Vader thing.  And nothing.  Nothing but a whining little brat with a very gay ponytail.  Ugh.  A ponytail?  Oh, this braid thing that's so annoying.  How did he get so fat for Return of the Jedi and bald?  That was that awful.  You are the Duke of New York. 
[00:37:30]  You are right.  Now I'm blonde.  That's stunk.  So when did you give up on movies?  I didn't give up on films, dude.  I hate...  No, you haven't seen a new movie in, I would say, five years.  And you know what?  I'm on the road line.  But when it comes to old movies, I mean, everyone hears it on this radio show.  He's got the...  Right.  You had to give up at some point.  Well, you know how to give up watching movies, because you can quote JFK until you're blue  in the face.  I love a lot of movies.  All the mob movies.  What was the last movie you saw? 
[00:38:00]  I think we asked him this already.  I don't remember.  It's been a long time, right?  Memento was all right.  I see him in hotels on pay-per-view, SpectreVision.  But I'm on the road, man.  I'm not paying to watch this crap.  I'm tired of films sucking.  I'm tired of Hollywood being PC and pandering to soccer mom C's and stupid kids.  So I won't support it.  They're garbage.  You just got a point there.  Anthony.  But I'll still pay him.  What's up, guys?  No, no, I just...  All right.  All right.  Anthony.  Yeah, go ahead.  I was saying, the worst thing about Star Wars, not anything in the movie, it's those stupid  previews for, like, Disney, Lilo, and Stitch, and that little Bow Wow movie, Be Like Mike. 
[00:38:30]  Little Bow Wow.  I heard that Matrix 2 was supposed to be the preview.  And I got to see this.  I'm all excited.  I'm going to see this garbage for Lilo and Stitch.  I saw that, too.  The reviews during the Spider-Man movie were just horrendous.  Except for the Hulk.  Horrendous.  You know they're going to mess that movie up.  I don't know.  If they do like Spider-Man, you never know.  Later, guys.  All right.  Later, man.  You know what I can't stand in the movie theater? 
[00:39:00]  They're showing the previews, right?  You're just sitting through this awful, embarrassing trailer that you just...  It's either unfunny or stupid.  And then it's done, and it goes very dark and very quiet in the theater until they get the  next trailer going, and you hear someone go, oh, I've got to go see that.  You just want to reach out and go, what is your IQ?  Here's how I knew I hated films after a while.  I was working at a gig in Wildwood years ago with my buddies John and his dude buddy. 
[00:39:30]  So we go to see...  What's the stupid John...  Enough with John Grisham and the stupid lawyer movie.  What was the one he wrote with Sandra Bullock?  A Time to Kill.  Yes, yes.  And I saw that, and I was so angry watching this movie.  Honestly, this is true.  I can picture him being angry watching a movie.  It was garbage.  I almost started booing in the theater, but there was a guy there with his kids, and I  didn't want to ruin it.  I'm like, yeah, the guy's taking his kids out.  Don't be a scumbag.  As soon as the movie is over, I go, that stunk!  And I'm yelling at them, like, how bad was that in the middle of the theater? 
[00:40:00]  And they're like, dude, we thought it was great.  And I'm like, you should both be stricken with cancer.  I don't want to go to the movies anymore.  It was horrible fluff.  Have you ever walked out on a movie?  A movie's got to be really bad for me to...  I walked out.  I don't know if I ever had, to be honest, because I go to so few.  I walked out of one in my whole life.  I forgot the name, though.  I almost walked out of White Ships Incorporated, and I was in that.  The Kim Basinger movie, was it Cool World?  Cool World, the cartoon thing.  That thing was...  That was the only movie I've ever walked out on.  You know what I walked out on?  I can't even be bothered. 
[00:40:30]  Mr. Mike's Mondo Video.  Remember that?  That guy from Saturday Night Live, years ago, he put out a movie.  Didn't he?  Well, he did all the Mr. Bill and all that, no?  Yeah, yeah.  That was that guy.  Right, okay.  And he had a whole movie full of just crap.  And, I mean, it's got to be bad when you're at the 35-cent theater for the Stone People  in Northport.  Remember that theater?  Yeah, we had a 35-cent theater, man.  Yeah, we had a theater in Northport.  It went up a penny every year.  Yeah.  Remember? 
[00:41:00]  And then, I think the year was like 1980, and I'm like, man, it's only 80 cents.  We've got to give up on this thing.  Yeah.  And they jacked it up to regular prices, I think.  But you walked in there, and the pot cloud that was in the place, they would just allow  you to smoke pot and drink, and it was so awful, even stoned, I believe.  It was a hangout.  Yeah.  It had nothing to do with the movies they showed at that place.  Yeah.  Because they stunk.  They showed, like, stripes and stuff.  I mean, great movies, but, like, 20 years after the fact.  Or walk out and walk into something else. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  But you walked out on that?  You could do that, yeah.  That was horrid.  Yeah, with the multiplexes, you know, you walk out of one movie, you walk into another.  Titanic might be the last day I went and saw the theater.  I don't remember.  Did you enjoy it?  I went only to see the effects on a big screen.  Yeah.  You know what?  I will go see Spider-Man.  You know what?  No, I didn't enjoy it.  It made me sick.  Really?  It's so easy to just say it was a bad movie.  That was a good movie.  Titanic?  Yeah, it was good.  No, it was, to me, it was...  No, no, don't talk about parts and the dialogue.  No, no, I think in general it was a good movie.  It was hokey, yes.  And it's so easy to say, oh, what a faggy movie, but the special effects... 
[00:42:00]  You're right, the effects were good.  But here's what I resent.  And what's her name's, uh, boobs?  Kate Winslet?  Her boobs?  I don't remember them.  I don't remember them.  When, uh, Leo there was, uh, doing his little drawing?  Yeah, she was slumming.  It wasn't romantic.  She was a whore cheating on her fiancé.  Oh, I understand.  The scene wanted to make you puke, but the fact that, uh, you get to see her boobs.  I love you, Jack.  Shut your face.  I know, I don't like any type of film that tries to yank it.  That's why I hated Gump in the theater. 
[00:42:30]  I love you.  She dies of AIDS.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah, they're going to make that whole thing.  That was a tragic, sad film.  Yeah.  They're not going to force it out of you.  And that movie came out when?  75.  It was as good as it should have.  But Jesus.  Or Pacino.  He did, I think it was Dog Day Afternoon that year, and he should have won.  Is that the last movie that you thought was good?  No, not the last movie.  What was the last movie you thought was good?  The last movie that you saw in the theater that you thought was good?  I don't remember, man.  It's been so many years.  I saw Jaws in the theaters.  I'm old, man.  I don't remember.  I really saw Star Wars.  Oh, you didn't see Memento in the theater? 
[00:43:00]  No, I saw it on pay-per-view.  It was very good, though.  That was a great movie.  Yeah, I enjoyed it.  A little weird, but I enjoyed it.  Don't you go see the comedies?  No.  Ugh.  No.  They're never funny.  Ugh.  They're always funny used cars.  You don't think like...  Oh, I enjoyed that.  Frank McRae was a great comic actor.  Right.  Very dark.  You don't check out the Austin Powers?  Never saw it.  Wow.  Why not?  I don't want to.  It's kind of funny.  There's something about Mary?  Half of that I saw on camera.  That I didn't find funny.  I enjoyed that.  No.  I didn't like something about Mary.  I loved that movie. 
[00:43:30]  No, I buy a lot of it.  Meet the Parents?  I enjoyed that.  I saw that on pay-per-view.  It made me laugh.  I love De Niro in that.  It's great.  Yeah.  There's a little something for the bride and groom.  God bless.  God bless.  God bless.  It's funny.  So, no, I don't go.  Look, after 1980, when they gave the Oscar, went to Ordinary People for Best Picture and  Redford for Best Director, instead of Scorsese and Raging Bull, I'm like, you know  what?  It's not worth going to.  Oh, without a doubt.  Raging Bull should have won that year.  Of course it should have.  That was a great movie.  Of course.  I forgot about that.  More Loser Mind was pretty good in that movie, though. 
[00:44:00]  It was a great film.  For people.  And I actually hate to say it, but I think that Hutton deserved Best Supporting Actor over  Pesci, which you got.  But, come on.  Raging Bull?  Come on.  Raging Bull?  Scott wants to say something to Jim.  I know.  I was going to yell at me.  Go ahead, Scott.  Scott.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, first of all, I walked out on Orange County.  That was, like, the worst movie I ever saw.  Yeah, we heard that.  And, uh...  We heard that after Jack and Colin were in the studio.  Right.  We're in here.  We know those guys, so we can just call them Jack and Colin.  Oh, I got you.  And I've never been more surprised than to hear Jim Norton say he was disappointed when 
[00:44:30]  the girl died of AIDS.  Yeah, you're disappointed in an AIDS death?  What's wrong with you?  No, no, no.  Not feeling good?  No, no, because that turned it into a comedy.  All right, you guys suck.  Take it easy.  Jim?  I think they used that.  Oh, God, that's so bad.  I saw that in the Fibs.  I love it.  Yeah?  Yes.  Private Ryan started good and then sucked.  What did you think sucked about it?  Everything after the war stuff.  Really?  I didn't care about any of it.  I didn't care.  I love the war stuff.  That's pretty good. 
[00:45:00]  The sniper up there doing his little prayers and stuff as he's blowing German heads off.  That was pretty good.  The war stuff I thought was going well.  War stuff, very good.  With the walking around, I've got to bring rise.  Shut it.  I didn't care.  Shut it.  I didn't care about it.  Love you, Kev.  Love you, Rick.  You're so excited to be back on the radio.  I know.  Look at you.  Walking around with stupid Bob Kelly buying things.  This is how I knew I had to get back on.  We're in a store, Delphinium, where there's nothing but homosexuals.  And Bob goes, dude, have you used that candle holder I bought you? 
[00:45:30]  And I'm like, I really need to do this.  Oh, my God.  I really take it out.  Let me just put it in my mouth and get it all done.  Because he bought me a little thing.  A little thing from my apartment where you hold five little tea candles.  Wait, wait.  Five little tea candles.  And what is it?  It's shaped like this.  What is it made out of?  It's made out of wood.  It's made of wood.  One, two, three, four, five.  And it's like, it's high.  I've seen these.  And is it some kind of polished, colored wood?  Black polished wood.  Yes.  It's probably about a foot long and two inches high.  Sure it is. 
[00:46:00]  Five little holes.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  We need a better version of that.  And it happened good.  I'm glad it was fuzzy because that was insulting and not appropriate.  Love you, Ben.  Love you.  And there was...  Yes.  I agree.  And there were five little candles.  And Bob's like, have you used those candle things I bought you?  And I'm like, this is disgusting.  Have you been to Bed, Bath, and Beyond yet for your place?  Not only do I do a bit in my act about that, I was going to say, I was going to say, I was  going to say, I was going to say, I was going to say, I was going to say, 7th of September. 
[00:46:30]  Dude.  Don't joke.  Yes, I do.  I have.  I spent a little over $1,000 in there in two days.  I could just picture you wheeling that Bed, Bath, and Beyond cart through the aisle.  I need a fluffy little pillow.  Throw it in the cart.  And you haven't seen Jim Norton on stage in the last eight months?  He does a 10-minute bid on that.  You don't know what a faggot I've turned into is shopping.  Oh, I swear to God, I almost bought a sconce from Urban Outfitters.  I was looking for sconces. 
[00:47:00]  I don't even know.  I don't even know what a sconce is.  It sounds like the scab an HIV-positive person that gets on their yam bag.  That's what it sounds like.  Yeah.  But it's not.  It's a little thing that you put on your wall.  A wall sconce.  Of course, a wall sconce.  And what goes in there?  A little candle?  A little candle.  A little tea candle.  I like candles.  I like that.  A wall sconce.  What do you want it to look like?  Dracula's house?  I got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Put a torch in there.  No, I didn't say I needed candelabras. 
[00:47:30]  I want little sconce.  Is it wrought iron?  Is it made of wrought iron?  You know what?  I really should be bludgeoned to death like Chandra leaving in a park.  Because I did buy, and my little leotard should be found tied up next to me.  With some yummy liquid in there.  Yes, but no bone stuff.  So they believe it was used to be tied.  I think they found some juices.  Yes.  So, Jimmy, wall sconce.  I do have wrought iron candle holders.  You have wrought iron candle holders.  They're the floor type. 
[00:48:00]  Walk this way.  You are making this place up.  He is so preoccupied with decorating his apartment.  It's amazing.  He's so where I used to live.  But it's amazing.  I don't see you as that kind of guy with the decoration.  Did you get a dust ruffle for your bed?  What?  Do you have a dust ruffle?  A bed skirt.  It's a dust ruffle.  You got a bed skirt.  You got a bed skirt?  I certainly did.  Look at his face.  I certainly did.  He's very angry.  You need a bed skirt.  I love macho men that are being faggy. 
[00:48:30]  I'm not macho.  They have to sell it to you like I certainly did because I'm a man.  Like that's a normal thing and why don't you have one?  It is a normal thing.  A bed skirt?  Yeah, dude.  You need a bed skirt or else the dust collects under the bed.  By the way, hanging out with my family the last week, they love the dice bit.  Dice home decorating.  Home decorating.  Love.  One of their favorite bits lately.  Keith Robinson almost punched me in the face for saying to him that I have to go, let's  go down.  I got to get a bed skirt. 
[00:49:00]  We were on the road.  I thought it was when you called him a nigger.  No.  Oh, jeez.  What?  He did.  All right.  I have never, ever said that when he's been on the road.  Ever.  Oh, my God.  No, we were on the, we were on the, I didn't say that, Keith.  We were on the, that was awful.  Come on.  Love you, Keith.  It was horrible.  I was on the, oh, my.  All right.  Well, let's get back to this bed skirt before we think of it.  We were on the road, and I said, I got to get a bed skirt, and he told me.  You don't even need a bed skirt.  You just get a, you just get a, you just get a, you just get a, a comforter that kind 
[00:49:30]  of hangs all the way to the floor.  No.  I'll touch on your hair until you cry.  It was, the, the bed is high, and I need a skirt, it just makes it look good, and chicks  like it.  Because you know why?  The legs that hold your bed up, it's unsightly when you walk into the room, because it's so  high up.  And do you have, and the mattress is so big.  Yes.  Do you have a bed skirt?  I call it a dust ruffle.  Aw, that always sounds cute.  It goes, it fits and it matches, you know, the rest of the motif.  What do you have, manly man?  A bunch of go-bots on the bottom of your bed? 
[00:50:00]  What do you have on your bed?  I have one of these things, I just didn't know what it was going to be.  Ah, see?  But I didn't buy it.  What'd you think it was?  Like I went out and got it under.  The only one that went out and bought it was you.  So what am I supposed to do?  Shoplift it?  I bought it, so what?  I'm a man, I don't need to.  Opie goes with the blankie.  I put my blankie.  I threw mine in the garbage because of the stupid double tape they give you there or whatever  to stick it on.  Double tape?  Double tape.  What kind of cheap stuff are you buying, Opie? 
[00:50:30]  I don't know what it is, but...  Double tape?  It doesn't stay stuck to the bottom of the bed, so I threw the whole thing out.  No, it's elastic and it goes over like the box spring.  Oh, I...  And then your mattress...  Boy, what a surprise.  We got the cheap one.  Yeah, what'd you do?  Stapled to the side of the bed?  It's supposed to go under the entire mattress.  I bet you bought regular sheets and they only come halfway down your mattress, too.  Did you buy deep pocket sheets?  I don't know what it is.  You need the deep pocket sheets.  What the hell with the deep pocket sheets?  Well, if you get a good mattress that is like a foot or a foot and a half tall, the regular 
[00:51:00]  sheets that are only about eight inches, it doesn't fit down the sides, Opie.  Dude.  So you need the deep pockets.  It's at least a foot...  It's like sleeping on Voss below the waist, about a foot high.  Just a foot high.  Opie, what's the thread count on your sheets?  I don't know.  Mine is...  I got the sateens.  Oh, you got the sateens.  Yes.  What the hell happened?  You got to have a high thread count.  You do.  Or else it's cheap sheets.  Yeah.  Cheap sheets are bad.  They're bad.  I had to buy two duvets.  What?  All right.  Now...  All right.  Now you've lost it.  I have no idea what a duvet is. 
[00:51:30]  I'll admit you do.  I'll admit I know what a bed skirt is.  I don't know what a sconce is and what...  A sconce, not a sconce.  I'm like shopping.  It's French for a...  Sconces is...  I don't enjoy playing Caroline's this weekend, by the way.  Oh, nice.  What is a duvet that you needed two of?  I'll tell you what I have.  I have my bed, I have a sheet, and a nice big fluffy comforter.  That's all.  Duvet is a comforter cover, so you don't have to wash your stupid comforter.  No.  I just called it a comforter cover.  Well, that's because, again...  I have a duvet. 
[00:52:00]  I'm classy.  Of course you do.  I'm bed skirted a duvet.  All right.  I got a duvet, too.  Doesn't matter what you call it.  See, we all...  I didn't even know I had a duvet.  I didn't know what it was called.  You can call it.  Love you, Mary.  Love you, Earl.  You can call it whatever you want.  It doesn't matter.  A duvet.  Yeah.  Well, I'm calling it a V, but it's really a C, and I'm putting it in my mouth.  It doesn't matter what you call it.  I have a duvet.  Yes, I do.  And you're proud.  I have a stain on it.  It looks like somebody took a melted marshmallow and threw it on my duvet.  I had to buy another one because I'm like, I have a C stain. 
[00:52:30]  You put a C stain on your duvet.  I didn't put it there.  It just happened to land.  Sorry.  I can't aim.  Do you have anything satin?  Do you have satin sheets?  No.  I would have gotten them.  I don't know why I didn't.  It's too expensive, man.  You know what?  With a comforter...  It's too slippery.  If you have a comforter that is also satin and satin sheets, the second it is not equal  on either side, like the second there's one inch more comforter hanging over the bed  than on the other side, this weird physics lesson happens, and the entire comforter will 
[00:53:00]  waterfall off your bed.  It's amazing.  Do you have satin?  Yeah, but we barely use them anymore because I got a new duvet.  Must be nice on your little red-burned skin.  Ah, you know, you just kind of get up a little, let your yam bag rub on it.  Feels good.  Feels like you're wearing giant panties.  It's wonderful.  Without that good smell.  Oh, you mean on your thing, I wasn't...  Yeah, okay.  I put them over the old head.  I love you, Jimmy. 
[00:53:30]  I love you, Big Kev.  Oh, my.  That's a good point.  You're right.  No, you're right.  You're right.  I agree.  You're right.  Okay, sir.  All right.  Well, that was a good fag hour, wasn't it?  We sure fagged it up that hour, Jimmy.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  Jimmy Duvet.  We got to pick our teams for the big game tomorrow.  Or the rest of our teams.  Ah, we're going to man it up.  We're going to butch it up a little now.  I think the game is sold out.  Yeah.  I don't even know.  Wow.  Any tickets available?  They're going to be released tomorrow? 
[00:54:00]  All right.  We'll figure it out.  But pretty much a sold out event tomorrow at Riverfront Stadium in Newark.  Close to 8,000 people will be there.  And all the people you know and love and hate from this radio show will be there.  Yes.  Doing their thing.  And we'll talk about that next, okay?  Sure.  Oh, and I got a new gag.  It's a good one.  Real good.  Almost as good as you drop something.  New gag.  Oh, I had to say, too.  That's Florentine.  Congratulations on the show.  Crank anchors.  He's in that.  Oh, he's in that one?  Yeah.  Yay.  Yay.  That's Florentine, so watch that show. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, congratulations.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:55:00]  In the New York City area, 877-692-1027.  I've got to tell you one thing.  The amount of wow signs I've seen this past week, unbelievable, Anthony.  Very cool.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Ken in Virginia wants to say hi real fast.  Hey, Ken, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  How's it going? 
[00:55:30]  All right.  Yeah.  I'm down here doing another wow sticker stop.  Oh, this guy does his own sticker stops for us in the D.C. area.  Goes to the station, picks up a bunch of stickers, and goes out and does a sticker stop.  Cool.  Where are you today, Ken?  I'm in the front of the White Market in Manassas, Virginia, or better known as Bobbitt Country, right in Davis Ford, crossing off of Liberia Avenue.  Is that near the skateboard stand? 
[00:56:00]  Actually, no.  The skateboard stand is in Tomat Mills, but if you'd like, I could go over there and meet some of your friends.  We need a wow sticker stop at a skateboard stand.  Skateboard stand.  Hey, Ken.  Yes.  You went down to pick up the tickets today?  Tickets for what?  The stickers?  I mean the stickers today?  Oh, the stickers.  Yeah, I came down and got them today.  Oh.  How comfortable was that?  Fine.  And they just didn't have enough money to give me an S-load of them.  Right.  So I got the minimum, as usual. 
[00:56:30]  How many did they give you?  I don't know, a little over 150.  You didn't hear any gunfire from inside the building, did you?  Oh, no, no.  I pack it, so if they want to bring it, I can bring it back.  I'm not worried about that.  That's why they called me the NRA member.  All right, Ken.  Hey, y'all have a good one.  Thanks, Ken.  Thanks for helping us out in D.C.  Hey, no problem.  We got someone in Boston checking in. 
[00:57:00]  Ryan, what's up?  Ryan.  Oh, man, I need this guy in the air, Brian.  Ryan, you there?  Ryan or Brian or...  This guy, you.  Hello?  Yeah.  What's your name, bro?  You just said hello, you dick.  This thing is real, huh?  Hey, dude, dude, dude.  Oh, my God, he's listening to the radio.  Dude, dude.  We're not talking about sticker stops anymore.  You're live on the air.  What an ass.  Hey, stupid, turn the radio off. 
[00:57:30]  You know how annoying this is, but it intrigues me every time.  All right, I got to finish it and see where it goes.  Well, we're going to say hi to him in a second here.  Yeah, listen.  Let's listen.  We're on like a two-minute delay or something.  Let's listen.  All right, to the guy that has the phone to his ear and he listens to the radio at the same time,  we are talking to you now.  I want to hear him answer it.  I want to hear him answer it when we go to the phone.  All right, he's listening because then he'll hear his name and go, huh?  He's going to answer himself. 
[00:58:00]  Ryan?  Not yet.  Here he goes.  Come on.  Well, what a delay in Boston, huh?  They don't trust us at all anymore, Boston.  I thought the delay in New York was bad.  He'll hear his name soon, and then he'll start answering on the radio like an idiot.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[00:58:30]  Listen.  All right, there's the music back.  Now you took the call.  Ryan, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  You idiot.  What a dick bag.  Yeah.  What an ass.  What a dick.  Yeah.  Ryan.  Shut up.  How are you?  Hello. 
[00:59:00]  What?  What an idiot you are, dude.  I can't hear you on my phone.  My phone is on the greatest phone in the world.  Well, Jackass, Ryan, don't you realize that...  Hey, stupid, I have the radio off.  He's so fucking good.  Holy fool.  That is great.  Is he still there?  Ryan.  Ryan.  I know you're talking to me.  My phone stinks. 
[00:59:30]  Hello?  He's still talking to the radio.  Yeah.  Ryan.  Hello?  Ryan.  Yeah.  Ryan.  Ryan.  On the phone, stupid.  On the phone, you idiot.  He's talking to...  Who talks to their radio?  No one talks to the radio.  You're on the phone with us.  Oh.  Yeah.  You.  You.  I love...  Yeah, you're funny.  Listen, he's talking to the radio. 
[01:00:00]  Ryan.  Oh, my God.  He's still...  It's going to go around again.  I know.  We're going to talk to him again.  Will he be smart enough to hear himself and go,  Hey, me!  That's me!  Wait a minute!  I'm talking to me, too!  Yeah, there's where it happened.  Hey, Ryan.  Ryan. 
[01:00:30]  Shut up!  How are you?  Ryan.  Ryan.  What a idiot you are!  Ryan.  Now he's laughing at himself.  Hey, uh...  Hey, Ryan.  Ryan.  What a bunch of idiots. 
[01:01:00]  What do you say?  What do you say?  He goes, how funny?  What a bunch of idiots.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Yeah.  He's still answering to the radio.  He's answering to the radio.  You are the biggest tool we've ever had on the air.  Brian.  Brian.  Hello.  Yes.  Yeah.  Answer us.  Brian.  I can't hear you from the phone. 
[01:01:30]  Listen.  I can't hear you through the phone.  Why?  I just want to tell you.  The Celtics are going to spank the Knicks, and Jason Kidd is a life-beater.  Oh, what a dope...  What a moron.  Knicks?  They're not even playing the Knicks.  That's classic, though.  That is classic.  What a complete ass.  There you go, Boston.  Looking good. 
[01:02:00]  Looking good.  That whole Jason Kidd thing is pretty humorous, though.  Wow.  What a...  People getting angry.  What an idiot to go to the press and say that, you know, he didn't like the fact that  the Boston fans were making fun of his wife and his kid.  And his kid.  Are you insane?  That just makes it ten times worse.  It makes it so much worse.  You know the mindset of the people in Boston.  Are they going to wear, like, a wife beater?  Hold on, hold on.  It's not the people in Boston.  The people in any city.  Right.  It's true.  When a team does this and say, oh, I...  But especially the people in Boston.  You know, they're poor sports. 
[01:02:30]  I can't believe they have, you know, sunk to that level.  So you're going to hit the press with that.  Of course they're going to, you know, really kill you.  The signs are going to be ridiculous now.  Tank tops up the yin-yang tonight.  All the kids from Southie will represent.  Wearing the wife beaters.  Jason Kidd's an idiot.  He shouldn't let his wife sit down on the floor.  Well, the Boston fans, basically, just in case you didn't hear, basically, I call  Jason Kidd a wife beater.  Maybe he shouldn't let his wife.  And he didn't like that, so he went on, you know, went into the...  Told the papers in the press.  And now they've got to play Boston again, and it's going to be ugly now. 
[01:03:00]  Oh.  It certainly is.  How stupid are you?  Maybe you shouldn't...  You know, if you're going to beat up on your wife, maybe you don't sit her down in the  front row with sunglasses, and then snivel when people laugh about it.  Snivel.  You know, that's not the problem.  They're going to give you a malarkey.  A little bunk?  Yeah, you know how it is.  And I didn't know it.  Love you, Jason.  Love you, Paul Pierce.  Is that your new bit?  What's that?  That's your new bit, right?  Jimmy loves everyone.  Yeah, no, I guess what you want to hear on the radio. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Let's go to Gary.  12-year-old Gary.  Hey, Gary, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  This is what Yankees beat Boston every year in the playoffs.  Yeah?  They're stupid.  Hey, Gary.  Hey.  Can I ask you something?  Yeah.  Were you on the Ron and Fez show bad-mouthing Opie?  Yeah.  Okay.  Just wanted to make sure.  Why?  I gave you tickets.  Why are you bad-mouthing me?  Because you gave me tickets, but you never went with me. 
[01:04:00]  That was the whole arrangement.  Aw, that was the reason for going, right?  Yeah.  I gave you tickets to see the Sabres.  The Sabres blow them out!  Well, that a good game.  Hey, good game.  Five to zero.  Yeah, that's a good game.  You're still crying.  Oh, stop.  We've taken care of Gary.  It was about being close to you.  It wasn't about being close to you.  Right.  It was kind of just the fun of going.  We're going to hang out with you guys.  All right.  Well, next year. 
[01:04:30]  All right.  Guys, I'm going to be going to the softball game tomorrow.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, we might have to introduce you to the whole gang.  All right.  All right?  All right.  See you, guys.  Bye.  Bye, young fella.  12-year-old Gary.  He's got to be 13 soon.  I know.  He's been 12 years old for like three years now.  13 months.  Softball game tomorrow, Anthony.  Riverfront Stadium, home of the Newark Bears.  Newark, New Jersey.  The stadium is absolutely beautiful.  We played there two years ago.  We're coming back.  And it's going to be great tomorrow.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  We've been off the air for a week.  I mean, we really want to hype this game.  But, I mean, just about all the tickets are gone.  I think they're releasing a few right now.  So there's a few tickets laying around for a standing room only.  Sponsored by Coors Light.  Doors open at 1130.  I was reading an email before the show today.  A lot of people are going to be tailgating like all morning long.  Oh, yeah.  Like last time.  I just hope they don't start bowling in the parking lot again.  No, the guy that brought the bowling ball two years ago and rolled it down the ramp to the parking garage.  That thing could build up some speed on an incline. 
[01:05:30]  Man.  You know, the loop-de-loop garages.  Dude, check it out.  So, dude, is there any way to set up 12 retarded kids with black pointy hats and roll a ball at them?  It would be interesting to watch.  Oh, yeah, 10.  I haven't bowled in a long time.  12 pins.  I'm glad I messed that up.  I'm glad.  Sorry, I'm not a fat person with a bowling ball.  Bowling stinks, and there's nothing funny about it. 
[01:06:00]  There is something funny about it when you're rolling it down a ramp.  All right, you're right.  You're right.  A loop-de-loop.  You're right, but I just don't bowl in my...  Hey, you want to go bowling?  No, stupid, I don't.  I'd rather pick up a hooker.  No, stupid, I don't.  Get off my phone.  So, they released a few seats, $10 through Ticketmaster, Anthony, okay?  Here we go.  Titanic slide will be there.  Oh, yeah.  Titanic slide and iceberg.  I'm hearing the iceberg, too. 
[01:06:30]  Yes.  Very excited.  We've got the ship and the iceberg.  We've got the $25,000 softball throw.  Ten of you guys will be invited.  I think it's ten.  We'll be invited down to the field, and I don't know.  I don't know how it's going to be set up, but basically, you're going to pitch a softball,  and they're going to have something set up, and if you nail it, you'll walk away with  $25,000, Anthony.  All those rules will be discussed.  Yes.  Sponsored by Sonic Blue's new Rio Riot MP3 player with 5,000 songs in the palm of your  hand.  Check it out at your local electronics retailer or sonicblue.com. 
[01:07:00]  Also, Anthony, tomorrow, Frenchy's dunking booth for charity.  Oh, my goodness.  Who isn't going to want to take Frenchy in the dunking booth, throw a ball, hit the  lever, and dunk Frenchy?  Dunk Frenchy.  So that's happening tomorrow.  A band we met down in Philly when we did that road show about eight months ago, I guess,  now, Anthony.  Yeah.  Octane from Philly.  They're coming up to kind of warm up everybody as you're walking into the stadium.  They're going to be just rocking in the front there. 
[01:07:30]  They're helping us out.  Check out the Comedy Central Crank Yanker's truck.  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah?  We got a Humvee.  We got a guy that's going to shave Stalker Patty's hair.  This is a real guy, right?  It's sponsored by the Air Force.  The Air Force.  It's going to be an Air Force guy.  And I guess the deal is we promised Stalker Patty $906 to shave her head again.  Some other people have to fess up now.  A lot of brave people said, I would throw in $100. 
[01:08:00]  I'd throw in $50.  I'd throw in that.  No one has come forward with the money yet.  So once again, Ed and I will be, I guess, covering everyone.  Well, I believe Devin, Buzz from Home Alone, he said that he would put in.  And he's in the game tomorrow.  He's outside, Devin.  Oh, Devin.  Macaulay Calkins, older brother.  Hello, Devin.  How are you?  Hello.  Hello.  How are you guys doing?  Very good.  You got your money, bro?  Yeah.  I don't want to pay.  That had to hurt.  Sorry.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  I don't want to pay. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, now you don't want to pay.  Yeah, I don't know.  You know something?  At least he didn't just come in or not mention it or not pay.  Now he's just saying he doesn't want to pay.  Yeah.  Hell, we give Stalker Patty $200.  She'll be happy.  Sure she will.  Who cares?  Yeah, let's see how little she'll do it for.  We should pay.  She should pay us rent.  She's now living under the stairs full-time now.  You know, every time I turned on...  There are pictures that are going to be up on foundrymusic.com.  Every time I turned on the station during the week we had off, all I heard was Stalker Patty.  On every show, she's living under the stairs. 
[01:09:00]  She can't afford anything.  How she's always got this potential appointment working out.  She's like, should I have it by Thursday?  Yes, she is.  I've got to stay under the stairs or I can't find anyone to live with.  I'm starving or this or that.  They got pictures of her sleeping on the couch under the stairs that are so disgusting.  She has, for some reason, a fishnet stocking on.  I don't know what that's all about.  And here's a gnarly toe, the second toe, the toe right next to the pinky toe. 
[01:09:30]  This gnarly, yellow-nailed talon is poking through the fishnet stocking.  It's so hot.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  If you released five rapists in that room when she was sleeping, she'd still wake up a virgin.  That is how heinous...  Penis.  Yeah, but come on, there'd be some good toe-licking.  They're quite not even intended to these fishnets.  They're probably just old and have holes in them.  You know what? 
[01:10:00]  You want to know what a toe looks like?  You want to know?  Go to the store right now.  Get those, you know those pink peanuts?  Those big candy peanuts?  They're huge and they're pink.  All right, grab that, right?  All right.  Now, go to the next aisle down.  Get a Fritos corn chips.  Now, grab a Fritos and shove it in the pink peanut thing  so it looks like a nail.  And now stick the thing through a rotting fishnet.  There you go.  See, you got it?  There it is.  You got it.  I'm picturing, like, Bosk's toe from Empire Strikes Back. 
[01:10:30]  That's true.  The bounty hunter, you know, when they're going along and showing all the bounty hunters  and you see the one foot hanging over.  Disgusting.  So, Devin, are you giving us the hundred bucks?  No.  Devin's backing out on paying Patty.  I don't know, yeah.  Why?  All right.  He doesn't want to.  He's saying why.  I got to agree with him.  I don't want to pay either.  All right.  Enough mic time for you.  But I have to.  He's out the mic.  Oh, God.  What a great idea, Joe.  How embarrassing would that be?  I know.  I'm going to go there.  Be on the phone from another state and have your mic turned off? 
[01:11:00]  After admitting that we're number one, yeah.  Good gosh.  Oops.  Oops.  I hate when that happens.  Anyway, so we shaved Stucker Batty's hair again, courtesy of the Air Force,  at halftime of the game tomorrow, Anthony, on the big, huge Jumbotron.  You'll be able to enjoy that.  And this guy's going to be able to shave her hair in, what, seconds?  Oh, yeah.  They do that.  It's gone.  It'll be good.  The retarded Laverne Shirley will be singing Take Me Out to the Ball Game.  Now, they will be mic'd, right? 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  They're going to come over the stadium sound system.  Yeah.  I just want to know, will we be able to hear them?  Will we be able to hear them over the crowd's chants and screams and taunts?  And they're going to have the words, right?  They're going to need the words.  We're talking eight.  I'll print out some words, but Lady Di was boasting, I already know the words.  I wonder if it's going to be worse than Nancy Kerrigan's rendition.  Well, we've got to hear that one.  Yeah, play that, because I love that one.  Eight thousand people screaming at these two aliens as they try to sing. 
[01:12:00]  Give me a break.  There isn't a sound system loud enough.  And I guess Tom from New Orleans was supposed to throw out the first pitch.  Hey, he's checking in from New Orleans.  Tom.  What's up, Axis-y Dads?  How you doing?  What up?  Norton.  Hey, Tom.  Norton.  How you doing?  Hi.  He just got you.  No, he didn't.  You said, how you doing, right?  He said, Norton.  I said, hey, Tom.  I didn't go, what or huh? 
[01:12:30]  Oh.  Good.  I'm glad I took a talk call, you dope.  Well, I guess we can tell everyone that Tom is blowing us off, right?  Tom cannot make it.  Why?  I believe he has another engagement.  Can't you enter rehab on Sunday?  I think he got a new job.  At another radio station.  How about that?  Down here in New Orleans.  Oh, here's Nancy Kerrigan real fast.  Hey, Chicago, let me hear you.  And a one.  And a two.  Listen to this.  And a three. 
[01:13:00]  Take me out to the balcony.  Take me out to the crowd.  I think the retard of Laverne Charlie will be worse than that. 
[01:13:30]  Worse than that.  You're going to hear thousands of people just going, shut up, you alien.  They were grooming her, though.  Nancy Kerrigan to be a big star.  Oh, yeah.  They were grooming her for one of the top slots in the corporation.  Before you know.  I said nothing.  Hey, Tom.  She's nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  He got him back for you there, Jimmy. 
[01:14:00]  Thank you.  Thanks, G.H.  I love hanging up on people because I'm a coward.  Oh, you don't want to hear the truth.  No, fatso.  It's supposed to be funny.  I agree.  I agree.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Bye, New York.  The bitter taste.  There we go.  I'm getting out of New York.  Who the heck wants to be good there at my age?  That pig's selfish fool. 
[01:14:30]  Tom.  Tom.  Hey, Tom.  Look.  Don't hang up.  Come on.  Let's talk now.  We wouldn't do that.  So what's going on?  You got me back, but I did get Norton, didn't I?  No.  Who's Norton?  I'm saying you did.  We went to the judges, and then they said no.  I'm saying you did, though.  Oh, jeez.  I say he did.  I say he did.  Why aren't you coming up?  Thanks, man.  Why aren't you coming up?  I'm deathly ill.  What?  I had it on the other, uh...  I've heard it off.  I'm ill. 
[01:15:00]  Cirrhosis does not happen overnight, you dope.  I'm deathly ill.  I'm deathly ill.  I got a case of the vapors.  You're not ill.  I'll go to the dentist for a cleaning.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  All of a sudden, this smell just kept coming up.  You have raccoons living on your teeth.  All right, listen.  You sound like John Mahoney from the Barton Fink movie. 
[01:15:30]  Uh-oh.  You're digging deep.  No, Barton Fink.  Come on.  You guys didn't see.  He comes out.  He says, please excuse the aroma.  After he's just puked his lungs out in the bathroom.  No.  When did you turn his mic back on?  Okay.  All right.  I'll turn him down so we can talk right over him if we have to.  There's another little trick for you.  Okay.  So instead of Tom from New Orleans throwing out the first pitch, we have even a better idea.  We're going to have Blind Dave do it.  Basically, we're going to have him walk out from center field. 
[01:16:00]  And all 8,000 of you will be directing him to the mound to throw out the first pitch.  Yeah.  Now, the crowd has to direct him.  You play an important part in this.  We're just going to have him in center field.  And he's got to try to walk to the mound.  And you pretty much direct him to the mound.  And then he'll throw out the first pitch for the game.  Right.  You should release a pit bull and let it chase him through center field.  You can't see it.  He just hears the barking.  A few other things really fast.  Victor's House of Music has donated a guitar that we're all going to sign. 
[01:16:30]  And you've got a chance to register to win that.  A guitar and amp.  They're going to have a booth set up.  I won.  MyCar.com will be there providing DVD players to give away in between innings.  A lot of stuff to give away in between innings.  We learned our lesson from last time.  Yeah.  Remember last time we were supposed to give away all this great stuff after the game?  Yeah.  It was pretty much a riot.  So we had to take all the presents and give them to people in the locker room.  Yeah.  When Reginald Denny got hit in the head with that brick, we all left. 
[01:17:00]  It was awful.  Coors Light.  They've given us a Coors Light golf bag, a Coors Light grill, and more.  God.  I mean, the sponsorships go on.  Our buddy Joey, who's outside the studio today from Paisano's, Anthony.  Hello.  He's in the studio now.  Paisano.  He gave us a bunch of gift certificates for that fine restaurant down on Mulberry Street.  And someday we may do Joey a favor.  That's right.  That day may never come.  That's right.  For your father. 
[01:17:30]  For your father.  We still got to pick teams, Anthony.  Yes, I know.  Why don't we take a break and we can do a little of that and a little, I don't know, something else.  Oh, look who else just walked in.  Somebody I wouldn't mind having on my team.  Jamaica Mike.  Only if he plays shirtless.  Comes with his own bat.  Why don't you warm up by hitting me in the face a little bit.  Yeah.  That's a good one. 
[01:18:00]  You're making Mike a good addition to the team.  You're either really great or you're horrible.  There's no in between.  He either should have been scouted by the Yankees or he cannot hit at all.  How do you think you are, real quick?  I grabbed that, Mike.  How do you think you are?  You're on my team last time.  You're good.  Yeah, I was on the winning team.  Did you do anything for my team?  Yeah, man.  What did you do?  No, I get on the field.  And when I get on the field, you guys call out the game.  I didn't get a chance to hit, though.  I remember that.  I remember the problem, though. 
[01:18:30]  You slid into third and it took us an hour to fill in that trench you left with your junk.  You look more like a guy that would enjoy a game of cricket.  That's it.  Or soccer.  Some cricket.  Soccer and cricket.  I used to play a ball.  Or gang rape.  Cricket.  Where are you at?  Or drug posse running.  That stupid game cricket where you're at bat for, like, what, a week at a time?  Yeah, it's around, yeah, like five days.  A lot of people play cricket around here.  I saw a lot of people in Brooklyn playing.  Yeah, a lot of people in Brooklyn playing.  Ridiculous games.  Yeah, a lot of, like, English to play.  Why does only one guy get to bat? 
[01:19:00]  No, it's two guys.  But what happens is...  Yeah, it's two guys.  The ball, the ball.  So you got to ball it to one guy.  Yeah.  And if you hit, then you run, you know, you could switch bases.  Yeah?  Yeah, like, you know, back and forth and stuff like that.  Why not just play baseball?  Yeah, exactly.  Cricket is better, man.  It's stolen from American baseball.  Hey, look, cricket play all over.  England, you know...  That doesn't watch.  The soccer does, too, and it just does crap here in the U.S.  Oh, man, soccer...  We like different things.  They call it football, you know, in other places. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, it's football.  I did know that.  Football.  Because the foot and the ball go together.  European retards.  No, man, you got to remember.  Yeah.  You kick the ball with your foot.  That's it.  That's why it bugs me.  Or do that lame head move.  Yeah.  Like they teach in gym class when...  You know, you're a goddamn third, fourth grader.  The gym teacher's teaching you how to hit with your head  so you could screw your head and spine up for the rest of your life.  Yeah, the ball makes the mark. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, void.  A little pin where they fill the ball up and void on your forehead.  Oh, Joe, it looks lovely, Joe.  It looks lovely, I guess.  All right, why don't we break in?  Wait, sir, I got a sick kid.  It's going to be a great, great time tomorrow.  A lot of fun.  Let's get back and finish off our teams.  We only have today to do it.  Yeah, so far on my team, I got Brewer, my brother,  who was the MVP of the game last time around.  Jim Norton's on my team.  Stephen Lynch is on my team. 
[01:20:30]  And Black Earl.  Black Earl.  I got Jay Moore.  Fish, who did very good.  Fish was pretty much co-MVP with my brother last time around.  My brother, Joe, because I'm obligated to take my brother, Joe.  No, he bounced out Jim Norton's lack of ability.  I really don't like the way Joe and I are be considering two, like, untalented cancers.  We may battle it out for MVP.  Two years ago, if you guys remember, I did get a hit.  Everyone has these glory stories two years ago.  No one did bad.  And I tagged out Norris at second, and he slid into my ankle. 
[01:21:00]  Did he hit you with his Archie Bunker hat or the cigar?  I don't like doing me and Joe being talked about like we're two girls.  Deal with it.  Me, I can see, but him, he's built.  Look at you, you're a veal.  I also have Pete Radovich.  College ball, the man played.  Two words.  Two words.  La, ma, sheen.  La.  Or three syllables.  And, uh...  Remember when la machine was supposed to be your member?  I remember.  Two years ago?  And breast cancer doctor. 
[01:21:30]  That celebrity list is something else.  We use the term very loosely.  We have a guy that once drove Tom Hanks to the airport.  Is he coming?  Oh, you haven't heard?  We changed the name to the Opie and Anthony softball game.  Yeah, it's just the Opie and Anthony softball game.  Who are we kidding?  A bikini celebrity non-show-up thing.  Grandma's softball game.  Grandma's delicious mystery softball game. 
[01:22:00]  Nice.  So, the latest, they released a few tickets for standing room for tomorrow's game through Ticketmaster.  Okay?  Get him now.  Well, let's pick some more players next.  Let's do that.  Opie.  He's a son of a bitch.  I'm sorry.  That guy's a rapist.  Opie.  He's a son of a bitch.  And Anthony.  And Anthony.  W.  It's Friday!  Friday!  Friday! 
[01:22:30]  Friday!  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  So, we've got to pick some more people for our teams, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Well, this is it.  We've got to pick everybody.  I know.  I don't think we should waste everyone's time.  We'll pick a few more and do the rest behind the scenes.  Yeah?  I don't know.  I think we could do this quick.  Yeah?  I hope so.  All right. 
[01:23:00]  Who gets next pick?  Two, three, four.  I think you do, Ant.  We do?  Yeah.  Anthony gets the next pick.  Okay.  For the big game tomorrow in Newark.  All right.  At the front stadium.  As I look at the list.  People are trying to say that we're lying and the game's not close to sold out.  What?  Yeah.  Find out for yourself tomorrow.  Oh, that's...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, sure.  Nice try.  There will be video clips and pictures for months to come after this game.  See for yourself, douchebag. 
[01:23:30]  All right, Ant.  It's your pick.  My pick.  I want big guys.  I'm going to go with Jamaican Mike.  I'm taking Jamaican Mike.  What?  Yeah, I'm taking Jamaican Mike.  Dude, show him the gun.  Show him the gun.  I don't want to see the guns opium working on it for a while.  Let's see.  Look at that.  Yeah, Mike.  God damn.  Look at that arm.  Hold and run, okay? 
[01:24:00]  Look at that arm, man.  I was saying outside, I just parked the trucks without power steering.  That's me, you know?  His bicep is as big as my thigh.  It's ridiculous.  Wow.  It is ridiculous.  That's something.  So I'm taking Jamaican Mike.  All right, look who's in the studio.  Paul Mercurio.  Hey.  Put your God damn clothes back on tonight.  Put your God damn.  Hey, Norton.  How are you, brother?  A lot of people want to know if you'll be warming up the crowd before the game tomorrow.  I will. 
[01:24:30]  If there are any old women, they're going to get punched in the face if they don't applaud  when I get up to the plate.  Who's playing?  What's the matter with your face?  Why are you so red, Lobster Boy?  I got...  Lobster Boy.  I got sunburned.  What is wrong with you?  I went out to the beach, and what happened?  See, I was only half of this.  The sun was the other half, and it burned me.  Paul, do you agree with me?  We went over this to start the show today.  Doesn't he make you uncomfortable?  It is.  It's like a white trash guy mowing the lawn all day. 
[01:25:00]  You're from Long Island, the East Coast.  How do you not put on...  Why don't you get the bullhorn and go,  Excuse me, I need a little help here.  You're half of this.  I need suntan lotion.  Now, when Anthony comes out and hits the beach,  I want everybody to just slather him with suntan lotion.  Beware.  Don't insult him.  He's not wearing a sweater.  That's his back hair.  I don't have back hair.  No, it's all been burned off by the rays of the sun.  Never had back hair. 
[01:25:30]  What did you do, a lance bass and get aboard the shuttle  and go around the surface of the sun and get a pin?  I was at the beach yesterday.  By the way, was there any underwater fighting going on at the beach?  No, that's Opie.  I know.  It was very overcast.  What?  It was very foggy.  You couldn't see...  Put your goddamn suntan lotion on.  Look at his pores.  They're just sweating.  It doesn't hurt.  It's very red. 
[01:26:00]  It's not a suntan.  You have some kind of a disease emanating from your crotch, from your junk.  No, it's very red, but it doesn't hurt.  It's really shiny.  Your eyelids are burnt.  What were you doing?  You went to like a third-rate crappy suntanning place down in Alphabet City.  You know how red you are?  You should be crying in front of a pile of garbage.  Oh, stop.  You look like you...  You look like the people...  I knew that would go nowhere.  I remember that.  That's the Indian guy. 
[01:26:30]  Very good.  You look like you took a tour of Williamsburg and forgot to put the suntan lotion.  You're that person.  I couldn't realize.  I didn't realize.  Show me where the tan stops, where the socks were.  Show me where that is.  Roll up your sleeve.  I saw that earlier.  Oh, my God.  It's going to take a while.  You are your father, man.  Look.  Did you tell kids to get off your lawn while you were there?  Get off the lawn.  You goddamn kids.  No, it was very overcast.  Why are you talking? 
[01:27:00]  Why did you take your shirt off?  Because it wasn't hot.  It was down at the water.  It was like breezy.  I was just hanging out.  How did you do, by the way, finding coins in the sand?  Did you do well?  I wasn't looking.  Beep, beep, beep.  How many seagulls are you getting in an argument with this time?  No.  You know, I effed up.  I effed up.  I underestimated the nuclear furnace that is our sun. 
[01:27:30]  He goes, after like three hours of being in the sun, he looks at himself and he goes,  ooh, I'm getting a little red.  I better put something on.  Everyone has been in that position.  At that point, it's way too late.  Was it the sizzling that tipped you off?  Yeah, the grilling.  I bet you had one of those foil blankets that you buy on late night television.  No, I didn't have a foil blanket.  One of those oval ones because oval ones do better in terms of even canning.  I think I have the big question.  What?  You never go to the beach. 
[01:28:00]  Why did you go yesterday?  Because it was out of Watchell.  I just went.  Oh, you went out to Watchell?  Yeah, don't worry about it.  I'm fine.  You went to Watchell, Rhode Island?  No, Long Island.  It's a nice spot.  All right, anyway.  I went to the beach.  You've been experienced with the beach.  So, Paul Mercurio in the studio.  Did you bring a sandwich wrapped in cellophane to keep it out of the sun?  Did your tuna soak into the Wonder Bread?  Yeah.  I'm such a geek.  It was, you know something? 
[01:28:30]  I wasn't on the air.  So, I had something to do.  Your face is so red.  You have to tell us how bad it hurts.  Picture him on the beach with socks on.  Just what an ass ant looks like at the beach.  I know.  The shirt, the socks, the back sneakers in the water.  Let me guess.  You got a pair of old jeans, cut them off, went crazy?  I did not go the cutoff.  How long did you work on the fray?  I did not go the cutoff jean route.  Did you bedazzle a jacket and walk around?  I did not go that route.  Did you have shorts on?  Wow.  You know, I was a little tired today. 
[01:29:00]  I wasn't sure I was going to have anything in the old gun there, but I'm doing all right so far.  You're doing pretty good there, Paul.  Did you have shorts on?  No, it was cold.  It wasn't hot.  So, you have a tan on your forearms and your face, and that's it?  That's it.  You wore long pants to the beach?  Are you collecting garbage on the side on the beach?  Is that it?  Did they give you those shorts, short-sleeved in one piece?  Were you whacking your bag behind a dune looking at people?  You're a weirdo.  All right, look.  Because if you're wearing pants at the beach, you must be whacking your bag looking at people. 
[01:29:30]  I'll bet you just the helmet is burning.  Some finger marks.  Some little marks in between the fingers.  Did you put a little visor on your helmet about halfway through?  Well, I'm sure there was white stuff.  All right, you know, I hope you all have fun at my expense and my sunburn.  What's next, planning on skiing in January with a Speedo on?  It will go away very quickly. 
[01:30:00]  It's like you went to Central Casting and said, make me up to look like the whitest man who's never seen the sun before.  It's like they literally lifted your hair and they put makeup around.  Yeah.  And they worked it in.  It's like if you went to the bathroom and washed off, it would just all...  Yeah, if only it were that easy that I could do that and be out of this barrel right now, I would wash and wash and wash.  It's like the devil from Willow.  Hold on, Charlie wants to say something.  Charlie, what's up? 
[01:30:30]  How you doing, Owen?  Hey!  All right.  Hey, the big yellow one is the sun!  Ah, you ass!  Ah!  The big red one is Anthony!  All right.  All right, now I tell you, I got a sunburn.  Well, now we can't...  I got to think about my next pick and we got to take another break.  Ah!  Ah!  Are you going to be able to play tomorrow with that burn?  We're going to have to spot you a couple of balls or something? 
[01:31:00]  I don't think that'll be your concern because you're not going to be on my team, Paul.  Oh!  Oh, jeez!  It puts the lotion on its skin.  You've got to warm up the crowd tomorrow.  Can we bring the megaphone?  Yeah, sure, absolutely.  Whatever you want.  Okay.  And I'm not going to be nice, though.  Oh, no, you don't have to be.  Oh, and they're going to be nice back to you.  Boy, what a threat.  You haven't hung with our listeners yet, have you?  No, you guys don't take me anymore.  Well, we're taking you tomorrow.  You're going tomorrow.  You know who's throwing out the first pitch? 
[01:31:30]  We have a blind guy because Tom from New Orleans can't make it.  Yeah.  Why he's going to be drunk?  Blind Dave.  Exactly.  Blind Dave's going to start in center field, and he's got to make his way to the mound  with our listeners pretty much directing him.  When he gets to the mound, then he'll throw out the first pitch for the game tomorrow.  That's brilliant.  Just don't hit Anthony in the face.  I don't want to hear him.  Right.  Ow.  Ow.  My thumb burned.  That makeup will rub off on the ball, and there'll be a big red spot on the ball.  Here's Anthony rounding first and the second.  Oh, I can't slide. 
[01:32:00]  No, he can slide.  He wore the long pants.  Just not on my arms.  Yeah, by the way, that's a good question.  What are you going to wear tomorrow?  A fur coat?  Yeah.  Yeah, I hear it's supposed to be a little chilly.  You're all red, though.  You look like one of Joel Steinberg's children.  Wow.  Wow.  A Steinberg reference.  You weren't getting enough attention today.  You had to do that, right?  17 cities did not get that.  That's okay, but the one that did, I was laughing pretty hard.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:32:30]  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  Bobby and Anthony.  Who's with drunk and white trash?  Ah, he got drooled.  All right, we're back to the draft for the softball game tomorrow.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Shook.  My pick.  I'm going with the big white gorilla.  Oh, you're taking Norris. 
[01:33:00]  Jeff Norris.  Wait a minute.  It's my next pick.  All of a sudden, now you're going for the big arm, guys?  Oh, yeah.  Jeff Norris on my team.  Well, even though he's been, uh, it's been obvious he's been with my team, I think I've  got to...  Well, what about you, Rick?  Man, he's still not even officially on my team. 
[01:33:30]  And he's helping you with picks.  So then all of a sudden, like, Opie grabs him.  It just might.  Yeah, that might not be...  I'm going to take Rick.  All right, you're making it official?  I'm making it official.  All right, Rick is on...  I'm a tool!  On your team.  You are a tool.  You're an official tool.  Oh, yeah, it's the tools versus the psychos.  Yeah.  We got our jerseys in, man.  They look good.  They're pretty good.  And they're so much better than two years ago.  They're actually...  They're real jerseys.  The other things were barely t-shirts with buttons.  Which means you'll be nice and warm tomorrow. 
[01:34:00]  Nice and cozy and warm on that chilly day in Newark tomorrow.  You asses.  Are you going to be the next model for Coppertone?  You know something.  With a little dog pulling at your swim trunks?  I want them hung up by their Buster Browns.  Jaws, idiot.  Jesus.  Sorry, I didn't get a 1975 reference immediately.  Oh.  I'm kidding.  Love you, I love you, Rick. 
[01:34:30]  All right.  You know what?  I need a second baseman.  There's two second basemen.  Give me a pen because I've got to start rubbing out one.  I think my next pick is going to be...  See, I picked Voss, but I don't even know if he could...  I don't know if he could even grip that bat.  Those tiny little dwarf hands.  Three steps for every one that it takes to get to a base.  He's going to have to throw the ball with both of those little legs. 
[01:35:00]  But you know what?  Think about the strike zone he's going to have.  Like that guy, Eddie, something that...  Eddie from the Cleveland Browns.  Billy Barty hits the ball.  It's going to deep center field.  Weren't they called the Browns back then?  No, they weren't.  What was the team, Ed?  Cleveland Indians.  Was it still...  St. Louis what?  St. Louis Browns, right.  Well, I'm supposed to be a good player.  Well, good.  With that, then I'm going to pick Paul Mercurio.  I heard when the ball...  Wow.  You picked me?  Paul Mercurio.  All right.  You're picking Paul. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, I just got to...  It's not ever coming out again for you.  Thank you, Paul, for doing that for me.  Is Voss playing?  Yeah, Voss is playing.  He's not going to feel the ball.  He's just going to insult it as it comes toward him.  I already have a shortstop, so I don't need Voss there.  Voss is on the line.  Hey, Voss.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up, bro?  I passed on you.  You passed on me?  Yeah, I'm picking Paul Mercurio.  Oh, Voss.  How can you deal with that?  That's all right.  That's all right.  Listen to me. 
[01:36:00]  I'm playing second base for somebody tomorrow.  I can't hear you guys because I'm in a restaurant.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, we can hear you.  Can't hear over the fry later?  What's that?  Hey, if you can't play second base, maybe you can go into Chelsea and be a catcher for  someone.  Oh, brother.  Why did I call?  You getting an extra big mitt for your tiny, tiny, ghoulishly small hands?  Who's that, Paul?  Paul.  Paul, what middle gig are you plugging in there today?  Oh.  What middle gig are you plugging in there?  Oh. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  I love you, Rich.  Love you, Paul.  Yeah, exactly.  What?  That's right.  You're headlining at the Laughing Bean out in Jersey, aren't you?  Yes, I am.  Where's the Laughing Bean?  All right, Voss.  Listen, I can't hear.  All I know is, listen to me.  I'm going to the batting cages again today.  I'm going to surprise a lot of people.  Why going to the batting cages?  Why don't you do an acting class?  All right, you know what?  I'm calling back later when I can hear.  All right, bye, Voss.  He doesn't have to pay to get in the batting cage.  He walks through the links. 
[01:37:00]  Let's see if he's a little.  He takes the toddler bat.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Oh, my pick.  I am picking Jersey's own king of heavy metal rock here at WNEW New York.  Oh, boy.  On Friday and Saturday nights.  Eddie Trunk.  One of the best heavy metal rock shows out there ever.  Eddie Trunk.  Going right for the athletes. 
[01:37:30]  Eddie Trunk.  You know what, Rick?  He's friends with Mike Piazza.  He really is.  He might jump for me right there.  He just might bring Mike along.  He really is.  But he makes Devin look like Brady Anderson.  Well, Devin...  Oh, wow.  Devin, during commercials, admitted that he just stinks.  Really?  Yeah.  You know, nothing of...  Thanks for helping us out with that scouting report, by the way.  You know, Rick Cerrone is still...  Hasn't been drafted yet there.  Look, we love Rick Cerrone.  We love his park. 
[01:38:00]  But, frankly, two years ago, Rick Cerrone sucked out on the field.  He didn't hit.  And he gives you an earful when you're not batting and you're in the dugout.  Yeah.  He screams and yells about all the popauchery that he's seen in the stands.  It's like your dad playing in the game.  Right.  He's like, all right, enough.  And the guy, like, comes out with a smile, like, we're all just having fun here.  It's like, no.  Hit the goddamn ball.  Pay attention.  Yeah, this is pretty serious stuff.  Eddie Trunk.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, you had me sweating there because we had a little meeting this past weekend. 
[01:38:30]  He said I was going in the draft to his side, and I'm sitting here sweating out the picks over here.  No, you are a tool, Eddie.  You are on my team.  I was like one of those guys on ESPN on the NFL draft when they're sitting there around the phone, you know,  with their hands on their face just waiting.  I said, wait, he said he was going to take me.  Where am I?  Oh, you're in.  Hey, I just came from the cages.  I got blisters on my hands.  I just got off the Stairmaster.  Stairmaster, I know I'm not the fastest guy in the world, but I'm trying to step it up for you.  All you idiots trying to get in shape a day before the game. 
[01:39:00]  That is perfect.  That's what I want to hear.  Actually, I started a week ago.  Call up Piazza.  Get some tips.  All right.  All right.  See you, guys.  You didn't have to go to a batting cage for blisters on your hand.  You could have went to Show World.  How obvious was that joke?  It's funny, though.  I had to do it.  Anthony sucks.  Trucking up Heath Avenue, man.  You know, he could call up Mike Piazza and get some batting tips.  Anthony, I need another outfielder.  I'm going with Joey Paisano.  Wow.  Oh, if that isn't a favor. 
[01:39:30]  You're calling in a favor.  What do you mean?  From Don Joey.  What's wrong with that?  He can walk around the outfield and show us who's buried where.  I got Joey.  Joey Paisano.  All right.  You're taking Joey Paisano.  He is now off the list.  Wow.  Okay.  Let's look at some of the pickings here now.  Getting a little slim.  Well, oh, God damn. 
[01:40:00]  He runs like he's got polio, though.  No, you can't.  I love the guy.  I've known him for many years.  But he runs like his knees are bungee corded together.  I know who it is.  Yeah.  He's my pal and all.  Oh, boy.  And, you know, not a good.  He's got to be in our dugout.  You know, he does have to be in our dugout.  And I love the guy.  And just for moral support, I am taking Adam Ferrara.  Nice.  Nice.  My pal.  There you go.  You better get a pinch runner with your next pick, then. 
[01:40:30]  Like that dude that played for the A's.  What was his name?  Herb Washington.  Herb Washington.  That was his whole job on the A's.  Christopher Reeve running.  I was just about to say Daryl Stingley.  More cities get Christopher Reeve.  Gotta go with the popular gimp.  I'm going to ask Jimmy something for the next pick.  Do we really want Voss in our dugout?  Voss, I tell you, is supposed to be a good player, man. 
[01:41:00]  I got to tell you.  Really?  And I really don't personally like Voss because he's cranky.  And he has the worst little physique.  But he's supposed to be a good player.  I wouldn't mind having Voss in the dugout.  Yeah.  Every once in a while, you need a 1920s joke thrown at you.  The jersey hanging down to his shins.  All right.  I'll take Voss.  Oh, he's taking Voss.  Someone has to.  Yeah.  All right.  There we go.  I'm on a team.  As the ball comes at him at the bat, he's going to go, let me tell you something. 
[01:41:30]  Before I hit you.  If you start to feel bad about the game or whatever, you can just look at those little hands  and they'll cheer you right up.  Hey, at least that's not me.  The ball's coming right for me and I'm dodging it.  At least I'm not a...  I'm dodging it.  You want to buy a batting helmet?  All right.  Will the batting helmet even fit on his little midget head?  Oh, well, he has a long, tall dwarf head.  Oh, yeah.  He's got the big head.  The torso up, he's almost normal.  His neck qualifies as a bat.  He has an elongated nothing.  Can we move in the bases when he's at bat so he can get the first? 
[01:42:00]  Everyone in.  Everyone in.  Every time he runs, I want to play Benny Hill music.  He's taking 650 strides.  He's halfway there.  Oh, wait.  He stopped to get another Jewish tattoo.  Never again.  In reference to joke writing, apparently.  All right.  My pick. 
[01:42:30]  My pick.  I am going with the hopes that he is just as awesome on the field as he is here.  Oh.  Our own.  Hold on, hold on.  I'll make a trade for Stinky.  What?  Because I might need his services in my dugout for some of my players.  Well, you know something?  I take him, and then we may trade.  Oh.  But right now, I am taking the awesome Garrett.  Brewer's not going to be happy.  You are on the tolls.  If you win, you share a hotel room with Mary.  Am I the last one?  What?  No, no, no.  No, there's plenty. 
[01:43:00]  You're not embarrassed.  We have a hotel room with a slapped up tub already for you and Mary.  Right.  With a trapped up tub.  All right.  Let's see.  Oh, boy.  What kind of a game is this going to be?  Why did I sign a waiver about no lewd behavior or nudity?  Because you're such a prude.  10-10 wins?  What about my playing with John Cameron Swayze Jr.?  I'm Lee Harris.  I love it when they cut up each other. 
[01:43:30]  10-10 wins.  Back to seriousness.  I'm done drafting.  I only need seven.  Wow.  Would you stop it?  The rest of these people are just downright awful.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  Nice, though.  All dirty to play.  Come on.  It's true.  Look at your potty mouth.  I would go with old dirty, man.  Old dirty?  Who's more experienced with a baseball bat than a Dominican?  That's true.  Like inbred. 
[01:44:00]  What do you think?  You know what?  I'm going to the phone here real fast.  Hey, Paul the pilot.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Look at you doing scouting reports before you pick.  Can you play?  Yes, I can play.  How good?  Pretty darn good.  He's got good hand-eye coordination.  He's a pilot.  What position can you play?  Center field or left field?  I've got a really good arm.  I can definitely reach home plate from center field.  Anthony, I'm taking Paul the pilot.  Wow. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  Paul the pilot.  I hope I get to play this year.  I didn't get to play last year.  Just don't crash your plane before tomorrow.  Hey, I've got to tell you something.  I tried to do a wow last week.  Yeah.  Over New York, I had the FBI call me up and tell me no.  Of course they did.  Yeah.  Are you insane?  No, I had it all.  I had it cleared until Monday.  Cleared by who?  Monday they broke me up and they said, we're shutting everything down again.  You're done.  You can't do a wow.  But I guarantee you guys, before the end of this summer, you will have a triple wow. 
[01:45:00]  One over Boston, one over New York, one over Philadelphia, all the same day.  Oh, cool.  All right, Paul.  We'll see you tomorrow, all right?  All right, guys.  I'll see you at practice.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  My next pick.  Is it true Voss is wearing one of those old-time uniforms?  I feel.  The Pittsburgh Pirate hat, that big square round.  Little teeny awful glove.  He's going to have to move in fast motion the whole time. 
[01:45:30]  He's going to have the only wool uniform tomorrow.  The Babe Ruth baggy uniform.  We were playing catch in the hallway.  He stinks.  He kept saying, throw me grounders, and he missed every one.  Yeah.  The nice thing was, he didn't have to stoop for them, though.  Did you quit jumping up for those ground balls?  Stop throwing those grounders waist high.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Well, I am taking one of New York's finest. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, boy.  Right now, I'm drafting.  Oh, boy.  Keith the Cop.  That's not good.  Keith the Cop.  I want a Keith.  Well, sorry, Charlie.  I was bluffing with that.  Keith?  You were bluffing with that, weren't you?  I'm looking at the same list you are, pally.  I'm not taking Old Dirty.  Did we see Old Dirty play at all?  Did you play last time Old Dirty?  Where is he?  Where'd he go?  Oh, God forbid.  Old Dirty's gone out to get a drink.  Anthony, I need a catcher. 
[01:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  Let's see.  Rick Cerrone or Steve C?  Let's see.  You have to take Steve C.  I know.  I'm going to pass on a real catcher.  Just remember, Rick Cerrone doesn't play serious.  He'll be like, oh, you know, let me just throw it.  Everyone's a winner today.  He'll tell you a story about a Passaic Chevrolet Grand Opening you went to.  Anthony, I will take Steve C as my catcher.  Passing on Rick Cerrone, who replaced Munson. 
[01:47:00]  Taking Steve C.  You needed a man to die in a plane to get a job.  There you go.  Well, let me confer here with Rick.  Yo, am I going to play what, man?  What's the deal, God?  I'm not going to go to the party, man.  Are you good?  Son, what it say right here?  It says any position.  Did you play last game?  Yeah.  How good were you?  Son, you were storing a buck 50.  I was behind the plate. 
[01:47:30]  Stopping them.  Dude, what you talk about?  Buck 50 is underhand slow pitch softball.  Opie was pitching overhead.  It was.  It was going 1.5 miles an hour.  Yo, the dugouts were getting drunk, and Opie went out on the mound, and I was catching for the brother.  He knows I could play.  Yo, my man.  Half a second in between pitches when I pitch.  I'm just a wonder.  Yeah, you got it.  You know, to all my players, the second he pitches, depending on what you do, if you take the strike or whatever,  step out of the box so he doesn't throw another one past you. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  He keeps doing that.  He'll get the ball right back, and then throw it right back at your strike.  What?  All right.  Go ahead, Ant.  I am taking ex-Yankee Rick Cerrone.  Wow.  There it is.  He's going to be yelling at you.  There it is.  First base.  Let's put in this team together.  All right.  Rick Cerrone.  Got the bad knees and all that.  All right.  We're down to what?  One, two, three, four, five.  Down to crap is what we're down to.  Yo, yo, yo. 
[01:48:30]  Don't compare me to crap, man.  Opie, man.  All right.  You know what?  I'm going to go with the baseball spick factor, and I'm going to take Old Dirty.  Yeah, there you go, man.  Come on, man.  Old Dirty is gone.  Let's hear it for Old Dirty.  Don't forget the apostrophe.  What position are you going to play?  Love you, Joe.  Love you, Old Dirty.  I don't have a third base.  I've got to go through the list.  Let's hear it for affirmative action, kid.  All right.  It's to you, Anthony.  All right.  Oh, my.  God. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  You know what?  I'm taking Cowbell Bill.  There you go.  Where's Bill?  Yo, put the blade on tape on, Bill.  How, Bill?  Cowbell Bill.  Of course.  Bill used to be able to hit before he got engaged.  What?  Bill's getting married?  Bill got engaged.  We ought to pull up some of the clips of Bill on this very program discussing the institution  of marriage.  He ain't getting married, man.  Yeah, he is.  On the wheel?  So the very newly engaged Bill Brady, Cowbell Bill, is on my team. 
[01:49:30]  Bill is a tool.  And I just, no, I mean that because he's on my team.  Yo, Bill, you've got to buy two rings.  You've got to buy the cubic zirconia and then the real one.  You gave her those cubic zirconia in the first few months of the engagement.  See if everything works out because you don't want to run enough with the real joint.  And you sound like a ladies' man.  Listen to O.D., Will.  And then what do you do?  And then a few months later when you think, all right, everything's cool, you switcheroo? 
[01:50:00]  How do you do that?  You're on the way to year or two years.  Wait, wait.  Two years.  They have it on their hand the whole time.  How do you get it?  How do you then get it and trade it for this new shiny ring?  Oh, come on.  You're in the pool.  Come here, baby.  You're playing around in the switcheroo.  She's Dominican.  She cuts her finger off.  You're watching boys complicate things, dude.  Not everyone has time to steal two rings, old dirty.  Hey, I'm working now.  I haven't broken the law in six, seven months, dude.  Oh, look at you.  All right, let's look who's left.  We have our own Ben.  Ben.  Frenchy.  Frenchy. 
[01:50:30]  Devin.  Buzz from Home Alone.  Big Kev.  Big Kev.  And I think that's really about it.  Where's the other list?  Where is that other list?  What, the non-drafted players?  List?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Is Mike Torrey playing this year?  Don't let the name fool you.  He's an accountant.  Joe Torrey's son.  Please.  Please.  It's Joe Torrey's son.  I benched him the entire game last time. 
[01:51:00]  If Mike Torrey could play ball, don't you think he'd be playing ball?  He's got kind of an in.  Wait, you're getting really red.  Oh, screw the glass.  Oh, that's your sunburn.  It's just my color now.  Ope screwed him last time, though.  He played the field for three innings but never got an at-bat.  Yeah, yeah.  That was really strange.  That's not true.  Ope, he had so many people going up to bat.  I saw his brother up at bat five times out of, like, eight batters. 
[01:51:30]  Who, Elmo?  My brother Elmo.  Nah, Elmo.  Nobody batted.  Elmo batted the whole game.  You better not do that this year, kid.  All right.  I'm going with, uh...  Ben.  You're taking Ben?  Yeah.  Yeah, we need a cabana boy.  Oh, Joe.  Oh, wow.  That hurts.  Well, he...  Nice thing is he can stand behind you and rush you while you're pitch.  Robin?  All right.  I'm going, uh...  I'm going with Big Kev.  Big Kev?  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Dude, I'm not taking Frenchy.  You have to take Frenchy.  Well, no faggots in the thugout, man.  Oh, they got Big Kev.  They got a guy who can steal bases.  What are you thinking?  Big Kev can hit.  Wait a minute.  If that thing goes over the fence, there ain't no running involved.  Ha!  Do you have something to say, Paul?  No, no.  Just kidding, Big Kev.  I love you.  You're a good guy.  No, no, no, no.  Wow.  His arms are bigger than my legs.  That's frightening.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Steve wants to say something real fast.  Yes, Steve?  Hey, guys.  I heard old Dirty said that he'd play any position, but you've got to remind him, 
[01:52:30]  step away from the car and put your hands on the roof is not one of the positions.  Ha!  Nice, Steve.  All right, Ann, I'll make you a deal.  What's the deal now?  I'll take Devin the hack if you take Frenchie.  Devin the hack.  Look, I freely admit that I'm not the best softball player.  All right.  I'm going to give it a shot.  I'll go up there.  I'll play.  I'm rooting for Devin and his pedophile mutton chops.  Love you, Norton. 
[01:53:00]  How about because everyone's not going to play it?  You see that little cut right below his eye?  He's claiming he got that from shaving.  I cut myself shaving.  Why were you shaving right into your eye?  I wasn't shaving under my eye.  That's the weird part.  I slipped.  I'm glad you did.  It looks like you're shaving your retina.  I know.  I know it looks bad.  I slipped.  Dude, I'll take...  I'll take...  I wasn't shaving under my eye.  I'll take Devin and you take Frenchie.  Well, they both stink.  Well, you know, Devin might be a good little ball player. 
[01:53:30]  Now, there are some players.  He said he sucked.  I freely admitted to sucking, therefore there are no expectations.  We each have more players than we're going to need, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  How about...  Look, let me tell you something.  Just because I picked some of these hacks doesn't mean they have to play.  I'm not going to play them.  Right.  How about if, you know, he's not on the list, but he's on the phone and I forgot to put him on the list.  I've got to get Plankfoot.  I've got to get my buddy Joe Curry.  Oh, boy.  You could take Frenchie and Devin.  I'll take foot.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:54:00]  I can't believe they're arguing over this.  Hold on.  I'm in the freaking room here.  That way you're getting the best of the deal.  If you take foot, you've got to take Frenchie.  All right.  Foot's awful.  All right.  I'm not that awful.  Foot, you are awful.  You're horrendous.  It's been two years ago.  You don't know.  Maybe I got better, which I think I did.  You have the coordination of King Gimp.  Now, look.  Horrid.  It's not my fault you and Bill couldn't throw the ball straight at me.  No, no.  Dude, we were practicing.  You know how we warm up before the game?  It's kind of cool.  You're in a huge ballpark. 
[01:54:30]  It's beautiful.  You're playing catch.  You know, you're warming up a little bit.  It's pretty exciting.  Joe Curry is horrid.  Every time you throw him the ball, it just falls out of his mitt.  And then he goes to throw it back, and he does this launch thing where it either goes way over your head  or it drops halfway between you and him.  Oh, please.  Nitpicking.  Nitpicking.  Nitpicking.  Joe, Blackfoot, you practice keyboards every day for the past ten years.  You didn't get any better on that.  What makes you think he's going to be a musician?  At least I'm not trying to join Metallica. 
[01:55:00]  Why don't you start a Metallica cover band?  Yeah, Brother Joe did try to get into Metallica on this show.  Touche.  Hey, that's a good one.  Hey, Foot.  Yeah.  You just, we give you a little uniform.  You sit and hang out on the bench.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Well, I might be very tired because I'm, be it, Governor's at Medford tonight.  So I don't know how much sleep I'll get.  But nonetheless, I will be there tomorrow with bells on. 
[01:55:30]  Plug hack.  Right.  All right, Foot.  See you tomorrow, man.  Bye-bye.  So I take Plankfoot.  And this guy.  And Frenchy.  Frenchy.  Frenchy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I can show you two more.  I can hit the ball, you bastard.  I can hit the ball.  You can, can you?  Yes, I can.  Not like they speak.  Now, you have been to the batting cage.  Yes, I've been with Billy Mack last week.  Now, they were telling me you've never been to the batting cage before.  No, never. 
[01:56:00]  And you, have you ever played softball?  No, I've never played softball before, but I hit all the balls.  But now he's saying, since he got in the batting cage, and he, like, started hitting them all.  And now he figures that's going to make him, uh...  Well, I can run, too, you know?  Of course you can.  Of course you can.  You're the French.  You son of a bitch.  Suck it, you bastard.  We've got to have a rifle for him at home, so he can drop that first and then run.  Just like old times.  And then we'll have a Nazi on first base that he can hand his French bread to. 
[01:56:30]  Anytime, Italiano.  He can run home the fastest.  Yeah, I'll show you the Italian ram during World War II, you son of a bitch.  Yeah.  There you go, Frenchy.  Suck it, I see you, Tumor.  Tumor.  When is Tumor?  I see you, Tumor.  He sounds like Schwarzenegger with Bell Palsy.  Hey, uh, our announcer is checking in.  Ah, Pharrell.  Scott Pharrell.  What's happening, fellas?  I'm down here.  I'm getting ready to binge.  We got it all.  We got Bud Wager, and I think the host, I mean the girls, I mean the ladies, I mean the last guy, I mean the Pharrell. 
[01:57:00]  I mean the Pharrell, I mean the Pharrell, I mean the Pharrell.  And they're going to be giving home.  I mean, we're going to be hanging out and meeting each other.  We're going to be all kinds of people exchanging positive.  Pharrell, Pharrell, where are you?  Where are you?  I'm down there, hanging out in Moe's Caribbean, 76 and 2nd, right on the corner.  We got the NEW van down here.  Rob and Matty are driving a buck ten, traffic jams.  I'm seeing lots of rack.  Keep the cops here.  He's got a 38, a 357.  It's all got the people coming down wearing shorts. 
[01:57:30]  Nudity is in.  It's going to be unbelievable.  I'm losing weight.  I ran 20 blocks to get here.  I'm glad you're sitting in traffic.  Hey, Pharrell, don't get too hammered tonight.  We need you tomorrow.  I told you I want to get in a fight for you guys.  Like, next week, I'm thinking, just a fist fight.  I'll cut somebody's throat out.  And then what I'll do is, before that, is have a blast at the OB and Anthony's softball.  We're going to go crazy out there tomorrow.  Foul ball.  Somebody's going to get plucked in the head in the seat.  I've got to see you guys play baseball.  I've got that tan Anthony has. 
[01:58:00]  He's looking fresh.  He's been laying on the beach, getting a little of that tush that we got down here tonight at most.  Most are horny.  He won't even come out of the kitchen.  Hey, Pharrell, is it true you're living in your office?  No, I'm not living in there.  I've lived in, like, 35 hotels in Midtown.  Yeah, I know that.  All over Manhattan.  I'm splatting it all over.  Manhattan should do that.  That sucks, man.  I hate it.  I'm starting to, like, pick up things.  I've got chlamydia, herpes, I've got a cold sore, I've got feet rash, I've got jock itch. 
[01:58:30]  He was coming in to the office to borrow some beer today.  Dude, man, every day.  At what time?  You guys, in that big, huge sieve of alcohol.  At 10.30.  I mean, Jonathan, all I do after I do the gig is go to N.A., hang out with my boy Stinky, bust off about seven Budweiser's, and then I go right into the McCarty's.  I love those delivery people.  And if it wasn't for Pharrell, nobody around there would have any fun.  What's up, dude?  Dicks are in here.  They're new.  Come on in.  Park your car. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, Pharrell.  Yeah.  What do you think tonight, Celtics and the Nets there?  I think I'd like the dude to mom, my kid, just like you, but the kid looks like he's got some kind of hematoma on his head.  He's got a big old hematoma.  That's what they told me I had when I was born.  Fluid on the brain.  I hear he has some problems, that kid.  I like the Celtics to win tonight and then to get Jersey back home Sunday for the same kind of game you saw the other night.  When you've got Van Horn scoring 21, you've got Kittleton on it, three or four guys in double figures, maybe Lucius Harris. 
[01:59:30]  I think the difference will be their bench and their outside shooting their transition game.  All right, Scott.  Boston doesn't have the running game to stay with them, I don't think.  But tonight they'll probably beat them physically and with the crowd.  All right, screw all that.  How bad are the signs going to get tonight in Boston?  Oh, my God, they're just filthy.  But I really like the Jersey effort.  You get a stabbing in Jersey, you get, you know, he's a wife beater.  Well, we all knew he was a wife beater, but the stabbing thing goes way below the bell.  I don't know, maybe we'll get a couple of cutoff packages or something.  You don't like my voice? 
[02:00:00]  Neither did my wife.  Screw you, buddy.  Some guy just told me he hated me.  Maybe he said he liked me.  I think his wife wanted to do me.  Anyway, hey, what position do you guys play in softball?  I'm going to be in the booth, unlike the guy last year that left the booth to play.  I'm going to do the whole game.  Yeah, we got it organized this year.  Matt DeVote was supposed to be our announcer last year, but he was having so much fun,  he came down on the field and pretty much effed us all.  Didn't he go gay or something and move to San Francisco?  Here's what we're doing.  What we're going to do is we're going to call the game.  What I can't understand is why they're not airing a lot the whole game. 
[02:00:30]  They must be making cash on those winky commercials they run on Saturday.  They bump Pharrell, they're bumping everybody.  Yeah, are we going to roll tape on the game?  Yeah, we got to roll tape.  Rick, we're rolling tape on the game so we can play some stuff on Monday?  Cool.  Yeah, we'll just...  Hey, you got to have that, man.  It'd be the best Saturday programming we've had in 10 years.  It's not a bad idea that I just haven't broadcast the whole damn thing.  You should.  It's going to just be...  How many cool people are going to be there?  Huh?  How many cool people are going to be in this game?  Like, who's in it?  Well, I guess you haven't been listening to the radio in the last half hour.  What, is it a surprise? 
[02:01:00]  Well, it's gotten to the point where we can no longer legally call it a celebrity softball game.  Well, at least you guys are going to be there.  It'll be a bash.  I know that.  I'm looking forward to it.  It's going to be crazy.  This party down here is nuts.  Big blowout tonight.  I'm expecting 25 of the city's finest to line up.  We got a midget coming.  We got tons of booze.  Everybody's sweaty.  There's barely clothing on at all.  I got chicks from Russia, Rio de Janeiro.  I got chicks from New York.  I got chicks from Vegas, L.A., Miami. 
[02:01:30]  They're hot from South Beach hanging out of the...  What the page?  All about.  I got chicks.  I'm providing the citizenry with dates.  All right, Pharrell.  If you guys need dates, Pharrell provides women.  All right.  At a cost, of course.  You can't go out without flowage.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Pharrell, we're going to see you tomorrow, all right?  All right, you guys.  I have a lot of you now to see you tomorrow out in Newark.  And then we'll go to Ferry Street, meet Portuguese.  All right.  There, Pharrell.  Take it up.  Take it up.  Scott Pharrell.  Toodle-oo. 
[02:02:00]  Jason Kidd's son had...  Someone once said, that's not a head, it's a container for a head.  Oh, my God.  The kid had problems.  What problem?  Did he?  What?  Did he?  Did he have fluid?  What is going on?  Did he?  Some kids just have big heads.  I heard he had problems.  You did, from home.  A lot of people got pissed when someone...  Because people think he does.  I don't think he does.  A lot of people got pissed when someone made the Mr. Met comment on our show.  Why are you so protective of this information? 
[02:02:30]  This is very bizarre behavior.  Someone told me.  It's very suspicious.  Someone says something.  Actually, no one ever said that on our show.  No.  Blame it on no one, just so you can get out of the Mr. Met line.  Love you, Mr. Met.  Love you.  All right.  Let's take a break in, okay?  I think the draft is kind of done.  We've got a few other players we'll just kind of slap onto.  We'll kind of smack them onto.  Am I on your team, Opie?  Am I on your team?  Yeah.  All right.  Don't feel too bad about it. 
[02:03:00]  Listen.  I know I'm freely admitting that I suck, but, you know, I'll give you a shot.  You'll bring some fun to the dugout, though.  I'll definitely bring some fun.  Which is kind of important.  We talked about that.  You need some players.  You need some...  The fun factor.  Oh, yeah.  Opie, Opie, I've got a question.  Just, you know, in case it's sunny, I don't want Anthony to get burned anymore.  Could you bring Jason Kidd's son just so he can provide shade?  You could sit on there.  Oh, you ought to say you're a horrible man.  Well, I understand that it throws a nice shade.  Oh, my God.  We were going to play Shirts and Skins, but the Anthony's condition. 
[02:03:30]  We can't take the chance.  That wouldn't be too good.  Shirts, Skins, and the Redman.  You're horrible.  He looks like a little black Charlie Brown.  I'm waiting for him to open his mouth.  I'm waiting for him to open his mouth and go, go, dad, go.  He's like a little dwarf, free.  Eh, eh, eh, eh.  All right.  Why don't we go to the F.U. line and we'll continue, okay?  All right.  Thanks for calling, and here's the open Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, this is David from Washington, D.C.  A big F.U. goes to Don and Mike for making my day so goddamn boring. 
[02:04:00]  Next message.  Hey, F.U., Don and Mike, we're tired of listening to that lame-ass chick that you got in there  just boring the hell out of everybody.  I mean, she may be a babe on TV, but she ain't a radio person.  F.U., Don and Mike.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to Don and Mike, you two whiny bitches.  You know why you guys suck in New York?  Because you just do.  It's nothing to do with Opie and Anthony.  You just suck that much. 
[02:04:30]  Next message.  A big F.U. to Don and Mike's dick who obviously don't know that Opie and Anthony always win  in the end.  Next message.  Hey, what's up?  This is Josh in Portland.  I'm probably the 100th person today to say this, but this is a F.U. for Don and Mike.  Guess what, boys?  Looks like you can't make it after all.  F.U.  End of messages.  Opie and Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big.  God damn!  They are heavily into one thing. 
[02:05:00]  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, says, then you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists.  You present it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you would do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags.  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  Because you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers. 
[02:05:30]  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance, none on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  The Opie and Anthony show.  None on us.  And then you say it like this.  Heh heh heh.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Hey, Mike Torrey's calling in.  Oh.  Oh.  Did he go undrafted for the game tomorrow?  No.  Who got him?  I think we all passed on him.  Oh, my God.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah! 
[02:06:00]  Mike?  And you had all those bad things to say about him, Anthony.  I did not.  Mike?  Yeah.  How you doing, man?  Joe Torrey's son.  Mike Torrey.  That hurt, guys.  Hoppy, can I play with you?  Oh, see?  He wants to be on your team.  Ha ha ha!  Oh.  You keep calling me the accountant, you know?  You've got to put me up to...  Hold on.  Anthony said all that nasty stuff.  You've got to put me up to the plate.  Yeah, my own manager said it.  That's the beauty of it.  Was he on my team last year?  I had him on my team.  What do you say?  I'm a closet Met fan, buddy.  Come on.  Are you really? 
[02:06:30]  Well, I was a bat boy for two years, so I'm kind of...  Oh, God.  How embarrassing for Joe.  Oh, that's horrible for Joe.  Joe was on the Mets.  I'm just looking to get in the game, that's all.  And whatever team is going to do that for me, I've got to go.  Well, you know...  Aw, what do you say?  Well, last time I had him on the team, I put you in the game, what, two outs in the seventh,  right?  I think it was the fifth, and the drunken guy behind me must have just got up ahead of  me without telling me.  I don't know who it was.  Yeah, it could have been anybody. 
[02:07:00]  That's true.  I think Mike should play...  And this is Jim Norton.  This has nothing to do with me wanting to meet Mariano Rivera and get a picture.  I really think he should be put on there to play.  You know, Anthony, I want Mike Torrey on there.  Oh, all right.  I hope he is taking Mike Torrey.  Oh, I love you.  Mike Torrey, yes.  Really?  We're going to give him a...  What position do you play, Mike?  Well, can I start?  Infield.  Anywhere in the infield, buddy.  You know what?  I need a third baseman.  Can you play third base?  Yes, I can.  Hey, why is there a rumor that you're really packing? 
[02:07:30]  That I'm...  Where did you hear that rumor?  I just heard a rumor, and I say this with love and respect, that you've got a really big  mule.  I don't know if it's true or not, but if it is, here's a little knuckle on the chin.  I'll call you packing.  I just gave you the old knuckle on the chin.  You're a good egg thing.  All right, Mike.  We'll see you tomorrow, all right?  All right.  Can't wait to see you guys.  All right, cool.  Wow, look at that.  I haven't seen Mike Torrey in a while.  He called up.  He spoke his piece.  There's a pre-game party going on outside the studio.  There's got to be like 20, 25 guys out there. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, not one chick.  Getting really, really...  Dominicans stealing the sofa.  Yeah, this is an amazing pre-game party.  25 men having beer.  And Mary.  And Mary.  Yeah, but Mary works here.  I can't hit on Mary.  All right.  Not one hole out there.  Thanks.  Love you, Psycho Tim.  Love you, Mary.  Mama Sheen looked at my sunburner and goes, you look like a dog, D.  Hooray.  Thanks.  Funny, isn't it? 
[02:08:30]  Thanks.  Hey, Ozzy.  Hey, boo-boo.  How are you?  Hey, what's up, Ozzy?  Oh, you know, I actually, I just finished the OzFest tour in Europe.  I want to check in with you guys about the game tomorrow.  I'm very excited about it.  You're coming to the game tomorrow, Oz?  Yeah.  I talked to Rick yesterday.  He got two VIP passes for me.  And thanks to Ben, too, you know.  Hey, Ozzy, you weren't driving that helicopter, were you?  Flying that helicopter, did you say?  No, no helicopters. 
[02:09:00]  I've been very tired, you know.  Like I said, toward Europe, you know, I'm very tired.  So I think tomorrow should be, you know, a good relaxing day for me, you know, before I tour the States and, you know, do the other first year.  Welcome back from Europe, Sugar Bear.  Oh, thanks, boo-boo.  I'm good to be back, you know.  Love you, Ozzy.  Love you, Sharon.  All right. 
[02:09:30]  They love you, too.  But that's all I pretty much wanted to say, you know.  I didn't have a whole speech prepared, you know.  I just wanted to say, I can't wait to see you guys tomorrow.  And it should be fun, you know.  You really don't have much to say when Sharon's now working the puppet strings.  Right.  No, I don't.  She always wrote all my speeches for me, you know.  Otherwise, I'm screwed, you know.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're going to see you tomorrow, Ozzy.  I had a question about the game tomorrow, if you would. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, go ahead.  Click.  Oh, boy.  I so saw that coming.  I don't care.  The fact that he did it makes me happy.  Oh, boy.  So saw it coming.  Did you see that helicopter crash?  Oh, my God.  They all survived, right?  Yeah.  How many feet up was that?  Was it like 11,000 feet on the mountain?  Well, Mount Rescue.  On the mountain.  Helicopter crashers.  Yeah.  And it just starts rolling.  Rolling, rolling, rolling.  All the guys that are in there are just, oh, we're still rolling.  We're still rolling. 
[02:10:30]  If it stopped right now, I'd be okay.  But it's still rolling, and I have no idea how I'm going to end up.  Still rolling.  Even right now.  Like I said it a second ago, but now, even if it stopped now, I'm still, oh, God, the pole just went through my chest.  One roll too much.  I am so glad I went to get that guy who fell in a crevasse who's been living a second childhood at 60, camping on a mountain.  This is what, and no one gets strapped in except the pilot and the co-pilot, you know. 
[02:11:00]  You know what I heard?  Those other guys are thrown clear.  They were just thrown out of the helicopter.  Whee!  Wait, how high was it when it hit, though?  It was 11,000 feet.  Yeah, they were about 11,000 feet up.  And it hit the mountain at that height.  And it hit the, yeah.  It looks like it got pushed by the wind, and then the blade hit the slope or whatever.  But you don't have to know anything about aircraft, but when you look at that, you can see the blade hitting the side of the mountain.  That's bad.  Blade hitting the side of the mountain.  That's bad.  Oh, I thought you meant it hit an Asian man.  I'm sorry.  I'll buy this.  I misunderstood. 
[02:11:30]  That's horrible.  Yeah, but these people, because I heard it was Mount Hood, and they say, well, many people every year have to be rescued from this mountain.  They should arrest the people that have to be.  Whose business is it of these people that they put other people in danger to rescue their sorry asses because they feel they have to mountain climb?  If you want to take that upon yourself and mountain climb, fine.  But if you fall in a crevasse, because that's what they call them when you're mountain climbing.  It's not a crevice. 
[02:12:00]  It is a crevice.  A crevasse.  I think Norton got two brand new crevasses to put in his apartment.  That's what I could tell my wife.  Right back to it.  When I'm wiping, I can say, I'm wiping my crevasse.  My crevasse.  Oh, my God.  A finger has fallen into the crevasse, and you know you can never wash that off.  Excuse me.  Is that your tongue in my crevasse?  Hey, Caligula, what are you doing with my crevasse?  My crevasse.  Excuse me.  I did not give you permission to toss my salad in my crevasse.  It's all that large necessary.  Open your eyes, Proculus. 
[02:12:30]  There is no reason, though, that people should go get them.  You and I paid for that.  That was Air Force Reserve.  We paid for that crash.  We did.  Because nine people were walking on a mountain, and someone decided to walk over a crevasse.  Yeah.  So the three people are tied, and then three, and then three.  So the last six get pulled in because of the first.  Yeah, this is what happened.  The first couple of guys are walking, walking, walking, walking, walking.  You're leading us, and then you walk in, and we all get sucked in at you. 
[02:13:00]  They fall.  They start tumbling down.  They take out the next two people, who take out the next three.  It's like a little chain reaction.  How many feet down was the crevasse?  30 feet.  The crevasse.  30?  30 feet.  Yeah.  How'd they die from 30 feet?  Nobody died.  Well, no.  One guy's dead, I think.  Three dead.  Yeah, three dead from the crevasse.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, good.  They deserved it.  That's the most of those schools we have to go rescue.  I agree.  There's some 13-year-old kid and his father are doing it, and the 13-year-old kid just  goes, voom, voom, right into the crevasse, and the father's just watching. 
[02:13:30]  He goes, well, it's kind of nerve-wracking at that point, but it's very surreal, and then  you've got to go into rescue mode.  Right.  It's a rescue.  You just see a kid swallowed up by a crevasse.  Well, he doesn't care.  He's in a loveless marriage.  He doesn't care.  Apparently, if you're up climbing a mountain.  Oh, son.  Hey, can I have your iPod?  Can I have your iPod?  I heard when they got done, though, they decided to get tattoos together, which was cute.  I thought.  That's awful.  Why would they do that?  I don't know.  That's horrible. 
[02:14:00]  Did he tell his son, love you, love you?  Pulled him into the crevasse.  I'm going to list people I love, too.  Hey, there.  Not your face.  You know that kid.  You know that kid.  There's like a 30-year-old kid sitting in the back of that helicopter tumbling over and  over again, just thinking, man, if I had just finished algebra, I wouldn't be in the  Air Force Reserve right now.  But not the pilot, though.  Oh, I know.  Imagine you just, your rotor hits, you're rolling.  It's really embarrassing.  The whole world is watching.  It's a beautifully sunny day.  There's like a two-knot wind. 
[02:14:30]  You can't handle it.  You crash your helicopter.  But is he rolling and kind of trying to work that stick?  Like, maybe if I just give it a little left rotor, I'll just, maybe, no, it's pretty  much not flying anymore.  I heard a flare got shot into it.  Play flare?  Just a flare?  Just a flare?  Hey, uh, Kim.  Hello?  What's up, Kim?  Nothing.  I want to do the 6 o'clock queep.  Oh, my God.  We haven't had this in so long. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, that's why I called.  Do we still have the song?  Yeah.  Kim, where are you calling from?  From Elmont, New York.  Long Island.  All right.  And you know how this works, right?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We got to play the song, okay?  Okay.  Wow.  We haven't played the song in a long time, Anthony.  The 6 o'clock queep.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queep.  Throw out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queep. 
[02:15:30]  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queep.  All right, Kim.  You ready?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Okay.  Here we go.  Shh, shh, shh.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queep. 
[02:16:00]  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queep.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queep.  All right.  Where were we?  Let's go to Portland and talk to Mark.  Mark, what's up?  Thank you, Kim, by the way.  Nice.  Sounded like you gave the old Bronx cheer.  Yeah.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Mark from Portland.  Oh. 
[02:16:30]  Stop it.  Don't play that game again.  Stop it.  You ass.  Silly goose.  I hear the guy that was climbing Mount Hood, though.  This is tragic.  He almost made it to the top.  He was going to put a wow sticker on the top of Mount Hood, Opie.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Not much.  You know what they really found in the crevasse there?  The comedic career of Rich Voss.  Oh.  Poor Voss.  That probably would have been more effective if you didn't, like, doubt yourself halfway through it.  Yeah, didn't he sound so...  The comedic career. 
[02:17:00]  There was no confidence in that line, was there?  Oh, the comedic career.  Career of Voss.  Of Voss.  Rich Voss.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Comedian Richard Voss.  Oh, boy.  Of Rick Voss.  Richard Voss.  Rich.  Rich.  They're yelling and screaming outside the studio.  It's heated.  They're hammered, and they're yelling and screaming about the game.  If they're hammered, they'll be in my dugout, I'm sure. 
[02:17:30]  Rotor composition.  Four titanium and fiberglass blades.  Not anymore.  I want to apologize to New Jersey before I read this instant feedback in me.  This is one for the Boston fans.  Mike from the Bronx.  You know, Jason Kidd's wife is loose because she squeezed out that huge head.  Oh, God.  I couldn't agree with you more.  Stop it now.  I'm sorry you had to hear that.  Why is society turning a blind eye to that gougely large head?  I'm very sorry you had to hear that.  Some kids just have big heads. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And they grow into it.  You heard from who?  I hear it's a bird thing.  It would have been in the papers, and there would have been something about what he had.  What does he have?  He looks fine.  He just looks like a big-headed kid.  Well, if you have a big, big, fat head, you'd probably grow up to be a big, fat DJ who fails at a big, fat major market.  But this kid looks fine.  I've never seen the two of you so protective of anything.  Aside from his big, you know, he's got a larger head. 
[02:18:30]  But it doesn't, have you seen him act in any way that might lead you to believe?  I just hear, I hear things.  Who needs to see him act?  He's got that giant dome.  Let me tell you something about big head, water head kid when I went to school.  They were doing something called mainstreaming children.  Why do I feel like when you start that low in your register, that means it's going to be a really long story.  I went to a school, 5th Avenue Elementary School in East Northport, New York, better known as BOCES.  No, it was a normal elementary school. 
[02:19:00]  But during this time, there was some experiment going on where a bunch of people got together and said it would be better.  With his head in your skin?  How red can it get?  It would be better to put profoundly retarded children in regular schools because if they interact with normal children...  They'll become unretarded.  Right.  They'll be better suited for life than they would be institutionalized with just the likes of other retarded children.  Well, you've proved that that works. 
[02:19:30]  Anyway.  Now, you know what, it's proof of...  It didn't help the retarded kids any, but it completely horrified us children and also any of the normal children that were running around also brought out more cruelty than I ever saw.  A kid comes in with a bad haircut or a bad sunburn, let's say.  They rag him bad enough.  A kid comes in with a pupil that looked like a goat's pupil.  You know that long, stretched out, fuzzy pupil?  The kid had a goat pupil. 
[02:20:00]  Frankly, he's never looking that closely into the eyes of a goat.  But hey, you know, whatever you do.  If it wasn't for the giant water head he had, we'd call him a goat pupil.  But he had big giant head one out, we'd call him big giant water head.  He couldn't hold his head up.  He had a skinny neck.  No, I kid you not.  He had a skinny little neck, this huge head and a goat eye, and his head would swing like he'd try to hold it up.  And every five seconds, it would go, and swing from his shoulder, across his chest, and back up. 
[02:20:30]  And then it would go, and kind of get centered again.  And then five seconds later, so I've seen that type of big water on the brink.  When he would wake up in the morning, he was more disgusted with his eye or with his giant head?  What do you think bummed him out more?  I don't think he knew anything.  He knew nothing.  He was like one of those kids.  Was he functioning?  No, he was completely out of it. 
[02:21:00]  Completely.  It was like a thalidomide kid.  And he was taking regular classes?  That's just it.  They weren't regular classes.  They had the special retard classes.  But during recess and lunch, they brought them in to disgust us.  I almost starved to death because I couldn't eat with the retards, and they're retarded like the fingers.  They get all sticky and wet with their own spit as they're holding up the Drake's coffee cake.  And I'm looking going, I can't eat.  Do you ever take him into the locker room and do a little experimenting? 
[02:21:30]  No, of course not.  You can experiment sexually.  I have with firecrackers in the keister.  Come here, bobblehead.  But that kid, what I'm saying here is, Jason Kidd's kid, he might have a big head, but he looks like a normal child.  No, he doesn't look normal.  His head is, look, you go with your instinct.  99% of the time in life, when you look at something, your instinct is, poor kid.  You're probably right.  I don't think anything's wrong with the child.  All right, let's go to Dave.  Dave, what's up? 
[02:22:00]  Let's put a giant needle in his head.  What's up, guys?  All right, Dave.  Hey.  Yeah.  How you doing?  You're from Boston?  Oh, I'm from Jersey.  All right, go ahead.  I just have a message for the Boston fans.  They can talk all they want because...  Hold on.  We'll put you on with a Boston fan.  All right.  Go ahead.  Tell Joe who's listening in Boston, Dave.  Go ahead.  Joe, you guys can talk all you want because after tonight it's over, buddy.  Hello?  Good comeback.  Good comeback.  You were all over that. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Dave.  We can't wait for tomorrow, all right, man?  Hey, Joe.  Joe, Joe.  Joe is another Boston.  Now are they trying to...  Is Boston's either gone completely retard or they're trying to make gags now?  All right, Dave.  We'll see you tomorrow at the game.  All right, guys.  You know what, dude?  Remember we were talking.  We wanted to do the bottle rocket trick tomorrow at the game.  Which one?  Which bottle rocket trick?  The one where it goes...  We might need a little fireworks.  Oh, my God.  The Star-Spangled Banner. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Can we still pull that off?  I would say no effing way.  Absolutely.  No way.  You're not getting that stunt past Newark Field, Bears Field.  No way.  Yeah.  It was highlighted.  But it's a cunning stunt.  It certainly is.  It certainly is.  Rick Serone would never let that happen.  No.  No.  He'd want to light the fuse in private, but in public, he's got to keep that image.  Steve's got a great line. 
[02:23:30]  Steve, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, I was one of those mainstream kids myself in one of those BOCES classes.  Yeah.  So much to the point that I didn't know if I was a big head kid or if I was a normal head kid.  They didn't even include me.  They told me not what was going on.  And I got back at them.  I'm teaching at one now.  Congratulations.  They had a girl in this school that would just let herself go liquid-wise.  Wow. 
[02:24:00]  Let me just say that.  Let herself go liquid-wise every day.  Let the river run through it?  Yeah.  Did you know exactly what time she could put your face into there?  It was during.  That'll never get through.  All right.  Now, why do you think I said it like let herself go liquid-wise?  I don't know.  If I could use that word.  I'm not thinking.  I'm sorry.  How old was she?  She had to be...  This was something like third grade.  Hold on.  Is Norton getting hot?  I'm enjoying this.  You're enjoying this.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  But you'd hear because it would...  You know those plastic seats in the cafeteria? 
[02:24:30]  And they kind of have like a little spot for your butt?  It would be like dished out a little bit.  That would have to fill up first.  And then we'd all see it just cascade over the back of the seat.  And then you'd hear it hit the floor.  Like a big splash thing.  And everyone would look.  Yeah.  Some people would just start clapping.  Oh, she's at it again.  And then the janitors would come in with the cat litter and the mops.  Every day.  And it stunk in there. 
[02:25:00]  And it was awful.  It was like I was in a goddamn...  The Hanoi Hilton for two years.  With those people.  Didn't they just put a giant sheet on her like a diaper?  They should have put a diaper on her.  They didn't have the pens in that day.  They were mainstreaming and it didn't help us normal children.  She was mainstreaming.  I still remember it.  Yeah, she was mainstreaming.  She was sloppy with her breasts, you know.  She was in third grade.  There were no breasts.  Dude, let's break.  It's hot.  No, there's something to that head. 
[02:25:30]  A little squishy pants there.  It was awful.  Don't you think it's better if someone tells him that he's got a hugely large head  than someone pretending like everything's fine?  It's not going to be fine.  He's never going to be treated like...  I'm the big head kid, Anthony.  I heard you talk about me.  Got this up again?  You're never mean.  It's softened on delivery, my friend.  I don't have kids.  I want porn.  I don't want porn on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  I don't want to take it off because you had kids. 
[02:26:00]  All you people and children make me epic sick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're psyched.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Brenda wants to defend Jason Kidd's son.  Brenda.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Brenda?  You know, I think it's wrong that you're all picking on him, that he has a big head. 
[02:26:30]  Didn't the brother from Home Alone, the older brother, have a big head, too, when he was a little kid?  Oh.  He still didn't.  He still didn't.  No, I didn't.  Thank you very much.  As we all uncomfortably look at Devin as he's in the studio.  I'm like the one guy who didn't say a damn thing about him the whole time.  It looks like Stonehenge with mutton chops.  Oh, God.  I'm the tiki head, yes.  That's me.  Yes, very good.  Huge head.  Thank you.  Giant forehead buzz.  That's what they do.  You got a big melon there. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  I can't catch that, can I?  Does your head get residuals from north by northwest?  Good one, Brenda.  Hey, Norm, you rule.  Thank you.  Good one, Brenda.  The one guy who didn't say anything throughout the whole big head conversation.  You should have said something.  I know, I guess I should have talked about it.  We love you, Devin.  Can we advertise our show on your...  Oh, by all means, yeah, yeah, that's good.  Very good, Greg.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  That can actually be seen from the naked eye from the shuttle.  Oh, no.  You can hear the engines just revving up. 
[02:27:30]  It's like...  The turbines are spooling up.  What time do the men come in to comb your hair?  Oh, God, dear.  That really...  Never even...  Don't you need a permit to walk around the city with that?  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  That's good.  What are you talking about?  That's good.  Here it comes.  What old dirty?  What up, old dirty?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  By all means, give me more opportunities.  Please, come on in.  No.  My man.  Please, come in.  Yeah, yeah.  My man made one movie. 
[02:28:00]  He's just collected on the residuals.  He did a few more.  He did a few movies.  We don't know what they are, but he did a movie about a kid being home alone.  Because of Dennis the Menace.  You're Latino, right?  Yeah.  All right, man.  Yo, I've been home alone since the age of nine, kid.  They never made a movie about that, man.  But a white boy stay home, it's over, kid.  It's home alone.  The criminals call.  They made a sequel.  You went planning with that, right, dog?  Went planning.  You brought a Benzino, though, right?  We called platinum.  Yeah, right.  Come on, man.  I told you, you got to put that on the pay-per-view loop, my brother. 
[02:28:30]  You got to make money on the way.  I'll call my boys.  You know what I'm saying?  Hi, I got to put this on the pay-per-view role, boyy.  The certain movies that come up always.  I mean, home alone is always going to come up on Christmas time, right?  So I'm going to make sure it's on the pay-per-view loop from like September to January, kid.  That's why I'm going to get my queen.  This is my new manager, man.  He's going to represent me.  That's a good idea.  Good idea.  He'll represent you.  Represent, represent, yo.  I'm representing.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Dude, get out of the loop.  I can flip your money.  That could be money.  All right, listen.  I got to get to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, Bob.  They just can't hear us in the...  Hold on.  Is something wrong with Boston today?  Hey, Bob.  Oh, boy.  Or the national phone lines.  Bob?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Is Pete around?  We don't even know what the problem is today.  Hold on.  Let's try this.  Bob?  Yo.  What's going on, boys? 
[02:29:30]  Hey.  Oh, dick.  Hey, real quick.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The second output wasn't on.  Oh, no.  For the whole show?  I think it got hit.  Uh-oh.  He needs to put a little plastic thingy on the on buttons, Anthony, so we won't turn them  off.  Plastic thingy.  A thingy.  Go ahead, Bob.  Hey, Devin's forehead's the only forehead you can fit a full plate of pancakes on it.  See in that sucker and I'll help.  What?  What?  What?  What is it? 
[02:30:00]  What?  I didn't even say anything.  Real quick.  What did I learn?  Here you go.  Norton doesn't like cool video games.  Meanwhile, he's the only guy that can recite the whole entire inventory of Bath and Body Works  and Beyond and whatever the hell it's called.  Bath and Body Works, you clod.  Clod.  You stink.  Bath and Body Works and Beyond.  And Bradley's and anything else with a B.  You buffoon.  What a boob. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  That bad is Beyond and Body Works and all the beast things.  I don't like everybody making fun of Devin's head just because it was filmed in the California  woods in 1967.  Big deal.  That's right.  We don't know if that was real or if that was a costume.  Yeah.  Come on.  Hey, wait a minute.  Wait.  Hold on a second.  Why?  Hey, why?  What is it?  I don't mean why.  You have a giant head.  No, I don't. 
[02:31:00]  Everything looks big to you because you're five feet tall.  Oh, boy.  I don't have a big head.  We're calling you a twerp.  Wow.  Devin's implying that you are a big-rich twerp.  I'm shocked.  The man who shaves his retina has all to say to me.  I miss shaving.  This type of facial hair takes a lot of care and maintenance.  That's all I got to say.  Well, the thing is, when you start and you look at your head from the top down, you say,  wow, that's wide. 
[02:31:30]  And as you scan down, your head gets wider.  It defies logic, gravity, medical science.  It's the global plane.  It's the global plane.  Well, listen, you're no winner yourself.  What are you talking about?  Keeping my magenta mouth out of this.  Tell you that.  I'm all red and stupid.  I can't say anything to anybody.  All right, red face.  Ooh.  Go make an arrowhead.  Hey, Chris, what's up? 
[02:32:00]  Hey, how you doing, ONA?  All right.  We're having our annual handball tournament.  Why don't we know if we could borrow Devin's head?  He could be the backstop, yo.  Jeez.  Actually, for everybody going to the games, food is served on his head.  The entire buffet.  And he's playing second base, and if the ball goes over the head, it's a home run.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, I'll give you guys.  Devin the Noggin.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Devin, I just want to thank you so much for saving me the money I was going to spend on 
[02:32:30]  that trip to Easter Island.  Now I only got to go to Newark.  Thanks so much, buddy.  Anything I can do to help there.  See, now it's that exaggeration here where your head is so...  Imagine if you had an Easter Island head on your toes walking around.  Hey, look at me with my Easter Island head.  That would be so ridiculous that now it's funny, see?  Oh, it's the Mardi Gras parade.  Oh, there he goes.  Hey, Dan, what's up? 
[02:33:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Tom?  Yeah, I got a question.  I'm driving my car.  I can't exactly see you in the studio.  Does Devin Grinowat?  Yeah, yo, he's got a smiley face, kid.  All right, I'm going to go listen to myself.  Hey, Norrin, when you're filming Spider-Man today...  Never, sir.  Oh, that was so bad.  I don't like the way...  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  I got him.  I'm going to get him.  Watch.  Quick.  Dick.  And I don't like the way people are implying that Devin's head knocked into that lamppost 
[02:33:30]  and knocked the lady out for a month a few years ago at a Thanksgiving Day parade.  I don't like those implications.  I was cleared of all charges.  That was not me.  I know this is getting old, but we've got to go to lunch.  It never gets old.  For God's sake.  Michael, what's up?  Michael.  Hey, guys.  Devin was the human model for big boy restaurants.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Collecting residuals on that, too.  Thanks, Florentine.  Thanks, Jim.  Yeah, good luck on the crank anchor.  Yeah, nice with the Florentine.  Good luck, boys.  How can he disguise his own voice?  I mean, if they mount his head in a missile, his head could break mountains, kid. 
[02:34:00]  You should go to Afghanistan, kid.  All dirty.  Darnell from Patterson.  He's reaching mountains.  Darnell from Patterson says, All Dirty has the street credibility of Simon and Garfunkel.  Wow.  That's a good one.  There's so many.  Wow, that's bad.  Oh, man.  He's got the street cred.  The street cred.  The car cable mustache.  Yo, me. 
[02:34:30]  Last time I saw a mustache like that, there was writing in between the scenes on the screen.  You should be tying a girl to train tracks with that mustache.  She's a Romero called.  He wants his mustache back.  Uh-uh.  Leave the mustache at the door.  The renters do.  With the way this show is going, I've got about seven more minutes of jokes.  I'm jealous of your mustache.  The calls are going to start coming in. 
[02:35:00]  Don't worry.  It's all right.  It'll fade after a while.  That mustache on your head would look like an eyebrow.  That was a double hit.  That's good.  The double hit.  That's good stuff.  Come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  Listen, you've got to laugh before you're going to die from nuclear war.  This is the only way to laugh.  We're all going to be dead.  Are you all geared up for the big nuke? 
[02:35:30]  Love you, Pakistan.  Love you, India.  We've got turbans and these Pakistanis, you all do, and they've got some serious weapons,  B.  Nuclear weapons.  That compromises our whole mission in Afghanistan, God.  That's right.  And let me reach out to both sides by saying, I need to go to 82nd and 2nd, and I'll take  a newspaper.  Don't bomb me.  They're fighting from trams and newspaper stands.  If you get your focus is by saying the first two things, don't bomb anybody. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll help.  India and Pakistan, that'd be terrible if they destroyed each other.  Unfortunately, with nuclear weapons.  Come on.  Grow up.  You know how this earth, with a tiny blue marble, we're all floating on spaceship earth.  Anthony, it's very simple.  If you're willing to put lotion on, you won't get hurt by the nuclear weapons.  I've said I was building a base, and I have a good base.  To get a commercial audition for Red Lobster?  Peter, I have a base starting so that when they nuke, I'll be fine. 
[02:36:30]  You'll all be...  Make those new cherry red pink?  What?  You'll all be burning.  So your second degree burns are going to help you from a nuclear attack.  We've got to go back to Peter.  Peter, what's up?  Hey, hey, hey.  Let Rocky Dennis know.  He'll get a residual check coming.  I just rented the movie for my kid.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Now that's way out of hand.  Oh, boy.  Poor Devin.  You rule.  Devin, I didn't know he was going to say that.  I was going to say, get a bottle of time and all.  Spent the whole day pulling little pins out of the map. 
[02:37:00]  That's okay.  It was a Rocky Davis reference.  See, that was the...  I don't think you had to explain it.  I think everyone got it.  See, I'm making you money already, right?  I know Clive Davis is Rocky Davis.  Rocky Dennis.  Hey, Paulie, what's up?  Paulie.  Hey, I want to know how much Devin got for playing the Hamburglar in the McDonald's commercial.  Did the Hamburglar even have a big head, sir? 
[02:37:30]  I think that was Mayor McCheese.  That was Mayor McCheese.  Mayor McCheese.  It was a Mayor McCheese joke.  Come on.  Her new name is...  Who cares if Devin can't sleep on one pillow because he'll die?  That's not what you're supposed to be talking about.  I am not an animal.  Pulling those tacks out of the map.  Wait, wait.  I am a man.  I have Grey's Anatomy.  Yep, you're an animal.  Hey, Sean.  Where's John Gielgud and Anthony Hopkins when you need them?  Hey, guys.  What's up, Sean?  Hi, Sean.  How are you?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing, Sean?  The FBI alert today that the Al-Qaeda plan was slamming two planes into seven tents. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  By the way, who's Al-Qaeda, overpronouncement man?  Overpronouncement man?  Yeah, is the Taliban going to be attacking, too?  The Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda.  Complete ass of Al-Qaeda.  Is this your new bit?  What?  Critiquing our listeners' skills?  No, but when someone makes a tremendous blunder like that,  when he calls it bed, bath, and bed knobs and broomsticks,  how do I not attack them for it? 
[02:38:30]  I agree.  I agree.  Love you.  Love you.  Love you, Sikhs.  Love you, Hindus.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings,  we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  Hey, man, we had a lot of fun today, huh?  Hell yeah.  It's good to be back on the radio and doing something on the air. 
[02:39:00]  That's fun.  Right?  And I needed some fun.  Making a difference.  What did you say?  Making a difference for all the big-headed people out there.  And for anyone asking questions,  we will continue to be on this station and WJFK in Washington.  Of course.  There's no...  I read rumors about people leaving and going back.  We will be on JFK from 3 to 7. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  Nothing being changed there.  Some disgruntled fans, maybe?  Yeah, you know.  People that are a little bitter.  People that don't understand facts.  Put on a shirt and tie and listen to your favorite radio show.  There you go.  You could do that if you want.  Can I just say it was nice to me?  Wait, wait, wait.  Bobby Valentine.  Check it in.  Yes, Bobby.  ONA.  Yeah.  Yo, Devin, what are you doing?  We can't start the game without the mascot.  Yeah, I'll be right down. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, I'll be right down.  Uh-huh.  Excellent.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Coming right down, Bob.  Mr. Met.  Uh-huh.  I thought he was going to do something.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  No, Ty, your fault.  I don't blame you.  No, that's...  I don't blame you.  I'm so excited.  Wait, shut up.  Everyone shut up.  Oh, we've got to go to the phone.  Don't blame you at all.  I've got to come to the defense team, because I just met the guy, and it was great meeting  you, and great being freaked out by your giant head.  Thank you.  It was wonderful.  Uh-huh.  I got you. 
[02:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  That's it.  No, no, no.  I'm a gentleman about this.  That's all right.  Oh, come on.  I don't like the way your skull is being compared to the Death Star.  That's right.  It's just not fair.  That's right.  Please, no tears.  This place isn't waterproof.  I'm a horrible skater.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Those aren't ears.  Those are indoor garages.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I got you.  That is awful.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  This is what he hears in his head.  Roar.  But we love you.  I know.  Oh, I know.  I know.  I know.  Because I love.  I learned that from our comedian.  The little Puerto Ricans hit your head hoping candy falls out.  James.  Did you get that from Rick?  I saw Rick leaning over and whispering that in your ear.  I certainly did.  Yeah, you did, didn't you?  And I also don't like the way you have a mullet, but your head's too big for it to hit your shoulders.  James from Philly wants to know if you had to put a Band-Aid over where those rotor blades hit your head. 
[02:41:30]  Wow, come on, what are you doing?  I don't get that.  Didn't I see the back of your head on 95 advertising Oxford Insurance?  Ah, say, say.  All right.  I guess that bit's done.  I guess that bit's over.  Thanks, Paul.  No, thank you, Paul.  Really, thank you.  But he was in Bedbath and Bruma thing.  The Cal Ripken streak is over.  Thanks. 
[02:42:00]  Hey, Blind Dave checking in.  He's throwing out the first pitch tomorrow.  It's now called the Opie and Anthony softball game.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, how's it going?  You're throwing out the first pitch tomorrow, right?  Someone just told me that a little while ago, yeah?  Yeah.  You know what we want you to do?  We're going to start you in center field, and you've got to make your way to the mound.  You've got to hit Devin's head.  Do I have my cane to do it with?  Am I back?  Yeah, you could use the cane.  Does the train start it again, I hope?  We're going to have about 8,000 people directing you to the mound. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, man.  And when you get there, then you get to throw the pitch, all right?  Can I spit on that pitiful Patty, then?  Ah, sure, if you can find her.  Ah, because you know why?  Why?  See if she'll shave her head for free, because every time she comes on the show, it's something for money.  I make an ass out of myself for nothing.  Because it's funny.  All right.  So you ready for tomorrow?  Yeah.  I'm in Connecticut now.  Amtrak sucks.  But how do you know? 
[02:43:00]  I know.  I know where I am.  Trust me.  You might already be in Newark, and you just don't know it yet.  Yeah.  My girlfriend just takes me to the beach in Lowell and tells me we're at the Cayman Islands.  Hey, vacationing's cheap when you're blind, dude.  How do you know she's a girl?  Because she doesn't have a penis.  I got hands.  All right.  Fair answer, sir. 
[02:43:30]  Fair answer, sir.  Fair answer.  Gotcha.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  We'll see you tomorrow, all right?  Hey, I got to ask Rick one more thing.  Can you put me on to him?  Ah, sure.  Thanks.  All right.  Hold on.  I thought he was going to try some shenanigans.  Yeah, I did, too.  A little click.  Got to ask Rick one more thing.  Ooh, Scott.  Oh, gee.  What do we got here, guys?  Good, Scott.  Hey, Scott.  How are you doing?  Hey, I want to let you guys know I'm going to be the first guy with asthma to scale Devin's  head and put a wow sign on top.  Love you, Norton.  That's great.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice to all that.  But you didn't know. 
[02:44:00]  You didn't know that he was going to say that, right?  Did it hurt to lose out on the Elephant Man part?  Did that hurt?  Oh, God.  I'm wondering if you ever ran to a bunch of little kids in the waiting pool and told  them to get out of your hat.  I've got a clammy cue ball talking to me about the size of my head.  Oh.  I don't get it.  What?  What is it?  Well, he's lashing out.  No, it's not.  It's not aggression.  It's not aggression.  I take it all in good stride.  Wait.  Wait.  I think I just heard a drop of blood rush from your head to the rest of your body.  That was really mean-spirited, didn't I? 
[02:44:30]  God.  That was mean-spirited.  I hate myself for that.  There's a few.  What do we learn today?  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today, I learned to buy two rings so if things don't work out in the first couple of months,  she won't bolt with the real joint.  We did learn that.  Tuttle.  I learned that Jim Norton puts as much care into his apartment as Ed Norton in Fight Club.  I didn't see it.  You didn't see Fight Club?  No, I certainly didn't.  Oh, my God.  How did you not see Fight Club?  I went to the theater, but Devin was sitting in front of me. 
[02:45:00]  No.  No.  They were projecting it on the back of his head.  Hey.  Oh, Mark.  Mark.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, hey.  How you doing, Mark?  Hey, Mark.  Mark?  Mark.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Can you get Blind Dave back on?  I want to see if you can see Devin's head.  Can Blind people sit-  No.  Wow.  Jeez.  I don't even understand that joke.  Jerry from Edison. 
[02:45:30]  I learned Anthony is the first man in history to leave Fire Island tighter than when he got there.  Wow.  Wow, that is good.  Okay.  Well, you said things on you are getting a little tight.  A little tight.  Yeah.  A little tight.  He also learned you can pick up on all the hip news by hanging at the skateboard stand.  Yes.  He also learned Frenchie hits all the balls.  Unfortunately, it's with his chin.  And Ant's new nickname?  Red Rocket.  Red Rocket.  Red Rocket.  Oh, Brewer wants to say something today?  Nice head, Dave. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, Brewer.  Why did you have to get involved?  Brewer will be at the game tomorrow.  He was supposed to stop by today, but I guess he got busy, which is okay.  We'll have fun tomorrow with him.  Getting sweaty palms.  Paul, you gigging tonight?  Yeah, I'm at Stan of New York in the city.  Good.  Anybody else?  Yes.  Oh, of course.  May I take this, Mike?  Oh, yes, yes.  That's right.  Tomorrow night.  Actually, this will be fun.  At Mulcahy's, right after the softball game, Evolution.  The Journey Tribute. 
[02:46:30]  The Journey Tribute Band that my brother is part of.  And Ant Plenty O'Pyro tomorrow night.  Uh-oh.  Good.  He's going to blow up the band.  That's right.  He's going to blow up the band.  Now, Mulcahy's tomorrow, right after the game.  Great place, by the way.  Any deal for anyone with a ticket stub, or?  Uh, no.  No?  Just come down with your ticket stub?  Absolutely not.  And, uh...  No deal.  No giant head.  Any deal for anyone?  I'll be bringing you on stage, Joe.  That's right.  And you can check out almostjourney.com. 
[02:47:00]  Hugo's amazing, man.  Of course he is.  He is the image of Steve Perry.  We're going on at 11 o'clock.  There's a band on before us, but who cares about them?  Yeah.  Well, there he is.  Mulcahy, he's right after the softball game.  Tomorrow night.  Leo, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Good show today.  Cool.  I learned that Jimmy never stuck his mule in a toaster, but he still knows it hurts.  Huddle, huddle.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Huddle, huddle.  Take it up.  Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Hey, uh, don't forget your signs tomorrow.  Remember the last softball game?  There were some great signs. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  The abuse was brutal, but we were laughing really hard.  Yes.  Signs.  We'll give prizes out to the people that bring the cool signs tomorrow.  I just didn't like the way today's show went.  I didn't like the fact that people were thinking that at one point everyone thought Devin's  head was flat.  That really bothers me.  Back in history?  I don't like that type of talk.  It was circumnavigated?  I don't think David Niven should be under your head circling the globe.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just wrong.  It's just wrong.  Old Dirty's sizing it up.  Checking it out.  What's up?  Well, is a large cranium a sign of, like, intelligence? 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  Sure.  He's a smart mirror.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Your mustache is about to turn into a butterfly.  Wait.  Wait. </pre>
