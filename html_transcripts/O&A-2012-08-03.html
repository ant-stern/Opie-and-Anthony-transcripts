<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an analysis of Limp Bizkit and Staind's declining popularity, focusing on Fred Durst's antics (including his relationship with Christina Aguilera and TRL appearances) and Aaron Lewis.  They played a Limp Bizkit cover of George Michael's "Faith." The conversation swiftly transitioned to the 2012 Summer Olympics.  The hosts commented extensively on the women's gymnastics competition, specifically Gabby Douglas's win, frequently using crude humor and commentary about the athletes' appearances and perceived racial dynamics.  A listener, Trucker Scott, called in to share his experience with a flying squirrel.  The hosts recounted a near-violent Thanksgiving promotion incident involving Fred Durst. They also discussed Olympic archery's popularity (attributing it to *The Hunger Games*) and Olympic volleyball, again focusing on the physical attributes of the Brazilian female athletes.

The show continued with criticism of the US men's basketball team's victory over Nigeria, questioning the ethics of running up the score.  Further Olympic event discussions included high jump, judo (with mention of a controversial incident involving a female athlete and her former trainer), and swimming.  The hosts continued their commentary on athletes' appearances and nationalities.  Kevin from South Carolina called in, highlighting the irony of the badminton team's criticism for lack of effort versus the basketball team's criticism for excessive effort.  The broadcast included graphic descriptions of a weightlifter's severe elbow injury and digitally altered nude photos of Olympic athletes.  Humorous commentary on athletes' names, including Destiny Hooker, was also present.

Nicole from the "Morning Mashup" appeared as a guest.  The conversation heavily focused on her partying habits, her tumultuous marriage, a recent major fight with her husband resulting in her sleeping on the couch, and her apprehension about having children.  Specific details of their arguments, including a cutting remark Nicole made, were discussed.

The show then shifted to discussions about Paul McCartney's Wings, baked goods preferences, and a caller's affluent family.  The hosts contrasted this lifestyle with their own, mentioning a previous incident where a woman mistakenly believed Opie was her father. The discussion included the caller's potential career path in the insurance business and ended with commentary on an awkward commercial featuring a grandfather jamming with his granddaughter's band.

The broadcast then opened with a discussion about a fire safety inspection, interrupted by Carol, a building employee, who explained a heat detector.  The conversation evolved to Carol's phone and then to homemade cookies from a security guard, leading to crude jokes about his family.  The hosts discussed their upcoming Chicago trip, including a police ride-along and Willis Tower visit, filled with crude humor regarding racial profiling and sexually suggestive comments about the security guard's relatives. They also discussed Jimmy's delayed flight to Chicago for Ozzy Osbourne interviews and the anxieties of Jimmy's "take the picture guy."  Further tangents included Roland wearing a dress, erectile dysfunction commercials, a hacked Yankees Facebook page, an umpire ejecting an audio technician, a lackluster Fox & Friends performance, a poor national anthem performance, Olympic trampoline judging, and the dangers of older trampolines.  The segment ended with listening to and commenting on various songs, including Depeche Mode and Johnny Cash's "Personal Jesus."

The final segment ridiculed the Olympic sport of trampolining, focusing on the athletes' appearances and the sport's perceived lack of prestige.  Offensive and stereotypical language was used.  The conversation turned to childhood experiences: dangerous trampoline use, prank phone calls (including to nuns and the White House), and bullying incidents, often incorporating crude humor and offensive language, including a video of children bullying another child. The show concluded by promoting an upcoming Chicago live show, outlining details and past outrageous events from previous shows including contests like a pig race, a worst breath contest, and a prize for the oddest item.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Sultry country sound.  Morning. Hi.  We were trying to figure out what band's playing at Fox and Friends  because when we come in in the morning, we hear them, I don't know, sound checking. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, they're warming up or some shite.  And I didn't recognize the sound, so.  What's the name of the band?  Huh?  Gloriana?  Gloriana.  Gloriana.  Can we get them up here?  Yeah, right.  Last week we had Aaron Lewis of Stain fame doing some country stuff.  Country song in one of his Stain songs.  He was pretty good.  I thought he was good.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  He got a lot of abuse because I don't know why.  I don't either.  There's a lot of hate toward Aaron Lewis for some reason.  Stain, I mean, you can't deny it.  They had a few really massive songs.  Yeah, people kind of look at him like they look at Nickelback.  You know, they see it kind of the same way.  They just hate to hate.  I don't know.  No, love to hate.  They love to hate.  I think there's a Fred Durst thing, I guess, because everyone knows Fred Durst is an asshole, 
[00:01:30]  so I guess Aaron Lewis has to be an asshole.  I didn't understand that.  Well, and they also had the problem of, what was that song that he played in here?  It's Been a While.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a massive song.  Exactly.  And I've never heard it before, Ten Feet in Front of Me.  And a lot of times, you know, when a song like that is so completely overplayed for so long, people just end up hating the band.  I hated that song because I heard it all the time.  I could still hear that song. 
[00:02:00]  And vocally, he's great.  Yeah.  I mean, he sounds like the record, so you know, you got to respect that.  Because they were trying to beat him up saying he's a hack and this and that as well.  At the very least, you got to say Aaron Lewis has a very good singing voice.  My God.  You might not like that he went country and all that, but I like the country song he did for us, too.  What do you do?  Endless Summer?  But I was surprised by the amount of hate.  You're always going to get hate because there's got to be assholes all the fucking time.  There's a lot of stained hate. 
[00:02:30]  But there was a lot.  Way more than I thought there would be.  But whatever.  War.  War.  He was a great guest.  And Fred Durst, man, we go way back with that guy.  Oh, man.  Did you?  He fell off the face of the earth, that motherfucker.  What are you talking about?  They had a new album.  Fell off the face of the earth.  We, I don't know, we did a few interviews with him back in the day.  We were one of the few radio stations playing his stuff way before anyone knew who Limp Bizkit was. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I remember him as being cool when he was on our show.  Yeah.  But that's like 15 years ago, whatever it would be.  People just started hating.  Oh, boy, did they start hating.  Just hating.  Why did they start hating Fred Durst?  What was the problem with him?  Nookie.  Yeah, I mean.  Doing it all for the nookie?  The nookie?  The nookie?  It just goes nookie.  Nookie.  What's wrong with nookie?  That really is like.  What is wrong with nookie?  You can take the cookie.  Stick it up your yeah.  Stick it up your yeah. 
[00:03:30]  It's bad.  Just stick it up your yeah, okay?  But is that the jumping of the shark jump thing?  As they say.  I mean, there were ways to do rap rock.  Like, Rage Against the Machine did it seamlessly.  I loved Rage Against the Machine.  They were doing their thing.  Fred Durst just came off like a poser after three songs.  But his first few songs, like, everybody liked, right?  Yeah, they were hard.  It was like fucking the real deal.  But then nookie.  But then you didn't like nookie? 
[00:04:00]  Come on, that's pretty hardcore.  Yeah.  Did he take himself too seriously like this?  Plus he was on, like, TRL and started, like, hooking up with Christina Aguilera.  That fucked him more than his music.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah.  The whole rap rock thing was very quick, though.  Like, everyone loved it, and then at the same time, everyone just decided it was terrible.  Because it became the new boy band.  Yeah.  In the late 90s.  I'm listening to the lyrics.  Yeah.  I want to hear how bad this really is.  So far, so good. 
[00:04:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Sam knows it.  If you're someone that hates it, you know it.  Hey.  My high school.  Hey.  It's catchy.  I'm a child of the 90s.  But this is catchy.  What's wrong with this?  I mean, it was...  It's a pop song. 
[00:05:00]  Is that a crime?  No.  Is that a crime?  I mean, why do people hate pop stars?  Because they hear them all the fucking time.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  You can take that cookie and stick it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear ass in there.  I hear ass in there.  I hear ass in there.  Exactly.  Come on.  So you can take that cookie and stick it up.  Yeah.  Stick it up.  Stick it up.  Stick it up.  Stick it up.  Stick it up.  Stick it up.  Stick it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice. 
[00:05:30]  That's all we need.  Wow.  So that was the reason why people started hating Fred Durst, though?  Come on.  And then that shitty My Way song.  No, I really want to know the answer.  Yeah.  My Way or the Highway.  That's terrible.  Wow.  Did you like it?  I think it was his offstage antics and relationships and things like that.  He just came off as like just a douche.  It just seemed douche.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was hanging out with Carson Daly.  He was hooking up with Christina Aguilera.  He was on TRL all the time.  He was not like rock.  That's pop.  He really started taking his fame very seriously. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  He started doing things maybe he probably shouldn't have done.  But he was fucking Fred Durst.  Is that him right there in the upper left?  Yeah.  That's what he looks like now.  He's like Fred Durst's death.  Well, dude.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  I like that Break Stuff song.  What?  Oh, Break Stuff.  I like Break Stuff.  That was a good song.  Just a teen angst song.  All right.  I can really relate to it.  It's the 90s, man.  Come on.  Roland.  Oh, yeah.  It was terrible.  Roland was horrible.  Yeah.  But you know all his songs. 
[00:06:30]  Well, yeah.  It was huge.  I mean, they were on track.  There you go.  They were giant.  There you go.  I was going to say he wasn't big.  What about Faith?  One of the greatest covers ever.  It's a great cover.  One of the greatest covers ever.  That was the big breakout.  Yeah.  Lent Biscuit doing Faith.  Holy fuck.  You want to pull your own hair out.  That was when he was cool, though.  Yeah.  He was still cool at that point.  But that song does something to the inside.  Holy fuck.  You want to punch people or something.  This is the song that made him famous. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  This thing is ridiculous.  Let's play the whole thing.  Fuck it.  It's funny.  I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body.  I know not everybody has got a body like me.  But I got to think twice before I give my heart away.  And I know all I get to play.  I turned him off.  He goes, you should leave him on just in case.  Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion. 
[00:07:30]  I'm trying to pick my heart up off of the floor.  So this part is average at first.  Exatio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm showing you that door.  Run.  Gotta have faith  Gotta have faith  Gotta have faith  Gotta have faith  Baby  I know you're asking me to stay 
[00:08:00]  Say PPP to go away  Cause you're giving me the blues  Baby  You might be all the more to stay  Can't help but think of yesterday  And another room tied me down  To the love of all you  Before this river  Becomes an ocean  Before you kick my heart up a floor  When that love comes down  Without devotion 
[00:08:30]  Wanna take some strong man, baby  But I'm showing you that door  I gotta have faith  Gotta have faith  Gotta have faith  Gotta have faith  Get the fuck up  Get the fuck up  I gotta have faith  I gotta have faith 
[00:09:00]  I gotta have faith  I gotta have faith  Rock it, bro  Rock it, bro  Rock it, bro  Rock it, bro  Rock it, bro  That was that?  Nice  Yeah, that was...  That's how you should start your morning right there, by the way.  People are probably like, what the fuck is...  I hope someone's alarm is going off right now.  The song no one cared about for the last 10 years of age to get us going. 
[00:09:30]  But that was when Korn was big, too.  And then the same thing happened to Korn, because they became a pop band.  I liked Korn a lot.  Yeah, like the first two hours were killer.  But then they became a TRL band.  And it was either NSYNC, Limp Bizkit, or Korn.  It didn't make a difference.  Oh, man. NSYNC.  Yeah, BSB, NSYNC, Korn, Limp Bizkit.  They were all just boy bands.  And then that other band.  98 Degrees?  No, the guy, Metal Rock.  Linkin Park?  Thank you, Travis. 
[00:10:00]  They were massively huge.  That was a great record.  I prefer 98 Degrees to Linkin Park.  But Linkin Park was massively huge, and they fell off the cliff.  They got a single.  Are they coming back a little bit?  They're doing a thing.  They're doing a fishbowl deal.  Yeah.  They're doing a fishbowl, L.A., yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Chester.  Chester Bennington.  Yeah.  People are saying the whole Fred Durst thing started at Woodstock 99.  That's a long time ago now.  Maybe, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  I just know that a lot of hate went his way.  What was the first song, though, before Faith?  Wasn't there a first song?  Counterfeit.  Yeah, that was a bit.  But that didn't do anything.  There's the buzzworthy song.  No, Counterfeit was the one we were playing at AF.  That was the one we were playing.  That really rocks.  Oh, all right.  Well.  And we were one of two radio stations across America playing it.  How does that one go at the beginning of that one?  And that's why Fred Durst came on our show.  Not the whole one.  Yeah, but that sucks for you guys, because for a second you could be like, we were the  first man to play Limp Bizkit.  But then they started to suck, and you were like, oh, boy.  I don't care.  I'll take that one. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  That's not cool.  It was at the time.  Yeah, for like a minute.  So that's all I care about.  Yeah, we were one of the first, literally one of the first shows to play Korn, too.  Korn used to play our just basic radio shows.  But now if you say we were in the dance to break Limp Bizkit, people would be like, fuck  you guys.  Thanks for nothing.  What are you going to do?  It made my life worse.  We were also the station that, like, of course we were.  Where else are they going to go, really?  How can you say this didn't do anything?  This was a huge song for AM. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, but as far as like Billboard goes, like it didn't charter anything.  No?  No.  It was a big radio.  It got them going.  It was a big alt rock.  That first Korn record, though, that was an amazing record.  And the second one was good, too.  Yeah, the second one was really good, too.  A little known fact about Fred Durst.  You can turn this down.  The interview we did with Fred Durst was in the WAF rock bus.  Oh, that's right.  During our Thanksgiving bit.  Oh, God.  Right.  Our turkey bit that almost got us, and I'm not even joking, almost got us killed. 
[00:12:00]  We haven't talked about that one in a while.  They're going to beat us up.  We decided to allow people to catch their own turkey for Thanksgiving.  Oh, right.  Oh, boy.  And we played around the words on the air.  In the end, it was paper turkeys in a dumb field.  But we had people convinced they could catch their own turkey.  And we didn't think anyone was really going to completely buy in, but they did.  And PETA was all about it.  They were fucking pissed.  We got a little press up there in Boston.  And then these listeners showed up with all sorts of shit to try to catch their turkeys. 
[00:12:30]  We were amazed.  Try to kill them, really.  Yeah.  I mean, we got the word out you weren't allowed to bring guns, but they brought, like, everything  from nets to hockey sticks.  Hatchets.  All sorts of shit.  I'm trying to remember all this stuff.  And then they all lined up and were like, yeah, the turkeys are out in the field.  This was a live broadcast.  The only reason I'm bringing it up was because Fred Durst came by for an interview.  He was in the rock bus when this was all going on.  While the turkey thing was happening?  Yeah, we did a quick interview with them.  I think they left.  I'm not sure.  You're lucky it wasn't after Nookie because they would have tried to kill Fred Durst. 
[00:13:00]  That's true.  Yes.  And then what happened was, to make the story short, they ran out on the field.  And when they realized there were no live turkeys and they saw the first fucking, you  know, fake turkey, paper turkey, which, by the way, meant you could get a turkey from  Wegmans or wherever the...  Not Wegmans.  What was up there?  Shaz?  Shaz!  Shaz!  You could go to Shaz and get a real turkey with the paper turkey and also other prizes,  but that didn't matter.  They really wanted to kill something that day. 
[00:13:30]  They wanted to kill turkeys, yeah.  So they came running back to the rock bus to get us.  And there's actual audio somewhere.  I don't know if we have it anymore, but I'm sure somebody like Kevin from Connecticut or  someone has it.  You could hear shit hitting the rock bus as we're hiding inside.  Yeah, they wanted to just beat up on the rock bus and maybe break a window or something.  Well, they did break some windows and something.  And we were inside broadcasting the whole fucking thing as they're throwing shit at the rock 
[00:14:00]  bus, eating the rock bus with the shit they brought there to kill real turkeys.  Yeah.  I guess you can't invite people to kill something and then not have something there for them  to kill.  Well...  They want to kill something.  Like I said...  They've got to kill something.  Like I said, we played around with it on the air.  Yeah.  We never officially said they were live turkeys.  They just assumed way too much.  But we were really good at that.  Well, yeah, I know.  That was your thing for a while.  We were really good at having people assume things.  Really good at having you assume.  You kind of... 
[00:14:30]  You misled them.  That's why they assumed it.  Yeah, but we didn't mislead anyone.  In the end, they got stuff.  Yeah.  We were just playing with their minds a little bit.  Misleaning them.  Anyway, what's up, Pat?  Nothing.  Did a little red eye last night.  That was fun.  Very good.  The Fox people.  And then apparently that episode of Louie aired last night.  I didn't know that was happening last night.  I didn't know it was either.  I guess I caught the second airing of it just in time to see it. 
[00:15:00]  It's a funny fucking episode.  Is it a good episode?  Oh, the kid with the fucking...  In the bathtub.  I didn't see any of it.  It's really fucking funny.  I DVR'd it.  I diarrhea'd.  Ah, the kid.  Fuck, I didn't see it.  And, yes, our radio thing.  Right.  Beating the shit on there.  The morning zoos.  Yeah, yeah.  Our radio thing.  Amy Schumer was the hole.  A lot of people were very curious as to who the hole was. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  Well, E-Rock Radio just tweeted the credits for the episode.  Oh, yeah.  There you are.  Right there.  Opie, me, Jimmy Norton, and Amy Schumer.  Helping out Louie C.K.  That was a thrill.  Thanks to Louie for allowing us to be on that fine show of his.  When I read it, I was laughing.  It was just fucking like when he first gave me the little script thing, and I was reading it.  I was like, this is fucking funny. 
[00:16:00]  It's just gibberish.  Right.  Like, yeah.  Just nonsense.  Puker voice.  Right.  Yeah, so that was pretty goddamn cool.  Absolutely.  Char.  And, yeah, that.  And I stayed in the city, but I didn't do anything.  I was really good.  And there was a tipping point right after I got done with Red Eye.  There was the fork in the road, the teeter-totter, the do you just go back to the apartment,  watch some fucking television, or do you hit the New York City bar scene? 
[00:16:30]  And I opted to go back to the apartment and just watch some television.  Were you sad?  No, I was very happy, especially this morning.  Really?  I was very happy that I opted for that and not some Iggy's karaoke or something.  Yeah.  Zito would have been there.  Oh, Zito would have been there in a second.  Enough about Zito.  What a coincidence again!  Oh, look at that again!  Zito doesn't need to be on our show.  You don't like it?  We did the Zito.  You hate Zito.  You could obsess about these dumb side players all you want. 
[00:17:00]  Whoa.  You hate him.  I don't even hate him.  I don't care about him.  I'm not bringing the fucking idiot up.  You go have fun with that on one of your 18 million shows.  We did the Zito.  I'm telling you right the fuck now.  Enough with the stupid Zito.  Yeah, so I was just...  I just went back and hung out.  Yeah.  Goddamn.  Thank God for that sling box.  Oh, is that thing the best thing ever, ever.  Time Warner can go fuck off.  Fuck off.  Yeah.  Now I watch my Fios from my house, and I just watch it here in the city. 
[00:17:30]  You watch the Olympics?  Yeah.  I was watching the Olympics.  I can't take it anymore.  What do you mean?  Enough with the swimming.  Don't worry.  I get it.  The Black Olympics start next week.  Yeah, I know.  They separate the Olympics.  Yeah, there's the White Olympics.  I did tweet that.  It was kind of fun to see a black guy in the pool, finally.  Yeah.  It was the first black guy I saw in the pool, even though I saw probably 100 swimming events 
[00:18:00]  in the last week.  Enough.  Yeah.  How many events do they have?  Enough.  A lot.  They got so many that the swimmers, like, are 10 minutes later, they're doing another  event.  Obviously, they got a problem when you got these athletes that, you know, they train their  entire lives, and they have a preliminary, and then 10 minutes later, they have another  race where they're actually swimming for the gold.  It's stupid.  For a metal.  They don't have it figured out.  You can't have these athletes turn around in 10 minutes and swim another fucking race.  Enough.  I turned it on because I'm kind of into the Olympics this time around, and I'm like, 
[00:18:30]  more fucking swimming.  Yeah.  And I already saw the Phelps Lochte, whatever his fucking name is, showdown on the internet.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Yeah, if you follow Twitter, I think it's breaking news.  They will tell you when an event's going down.  They go, it's going down right the fuck now.  And they'll even say Phelps Lochte showdown.  And I clicked on that link, and it was beautiful.  There you go.  There's the event in real time.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  I didn't know that was going on.  I think it's breaking news is doing that for the key ones. 
[00:19:00]  They're not just saying, oh, you know, it's the 18th heat in the 200 women's butterfly.  It's only the key ones where they know people are going to want to click on it and check it out.  Well, the women's gymnastics was very exciting.  Our own Gabby fucking...  Douglas?  Gabby Earl Douglas.  I say she looks like mini Oprah.  I'm going with the mini Oprah myself.  She is mini Oprah, a little mini Oprah.  I tried the pygmy thing yesterday.  It didn't work, so now I'm going with mini Oprah.  Mini Oprah, that's pretty good. 
[00:19:30]  Mini Oprah, right?  Yeah, she also looks like someone else.  I can't figure it out, though.  Can't figure it out.  But, yeah, her and whatever the hell is in her crotch seems to have won a gold medal.  What's going on in the crotch?  I have no goddamn idea, but it's bigger than anything I've seen in any of these other girls' crotches.  There's something going on to the point where they're actually, like, filming her and taking pictures from different angles.  Oh, young Todd Bridges.  Young Todd Bridges, yes.  That's a good one.  Very good. 
[00:20:00]  Thank you.  I see a younger mini Oprah.  Tootie?  No, no Tootie.  Tootie.  You know what her, uh, you see that last name of hers?  Yeah.  Look at the letters.  Yeah.  There's a conspiracy theory happening here.  Wait, what?  Look at the last name, Douglas.  Douglas, yeah.  Move those letters around.  What does it say?  I'll give you a chance.  Move those fucking letters around.  All right.  There's gold. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Wait a minute.  Mm-hmm.  E.  S.  You got the hard part.  I know.  What's left?  There's just an S, an A, and a U left.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding, right?  Um, A, S, U, A, U, S.  Wait, one more.  U, S, A.  Hey!  There you go.  Oh! 
[00:21:00]  There's a conspiracy going on.  Her last name, you moved those letters around.  It's USA Gold, baby.  USA Gold.  It's USA Gold, baby.  Well, it was a given.  This was destiny.  This was destiny.  I gotta be honest with you.  And she's not even 16, right?  I think she is.  I think she's the one that turned 16.  No, that was some other white chick.  Oh, somebody else?  I gotta tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  She did a great job.  From what I know about the floor exercise, it looks pretty goddamn good.  Yeah.  But I gotta tell you, I think that little rushki fucking one that looks like she has progeria. 
[00:21:30]  Which one?  The tiniest one.  The tiniest Russian.  She's the one that went last.  Was she the one that looked like she was about to have a breakdown at any moment?  Yes, please, please.  And then she just starts crying her eyes out.  What the fuck do they do to these people when they're not on the...  Man, that's crazy shit.  When they're not competing, you see it in their eyes.  They're ready to fucking start crying.  But I think she pulled it off just a little better.  Yeah.  She stuck her landings better.  She has that Russian fucking... 
[00:22:00]  That dancing thing they do.  Mm-hmm.  But that Gabby Douglas does have that big smile.  What do you mean?  She was better on the floor exercises?  I think so.  Yeah, but that wasn't the medal for All Around?  All Around, but the floor exercise is part of the All Around, and it was pretty much...  The floor exercise...  It came down to the floor exercise.  Oh, see, I didn't hang in there that long.  Where everybody was placed.  Gotcha.  And, uh...  Yeah, I got...  What, did they send Gabby away to some fucking faraway wacky state to train? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, she was...  They got her out of the, what, the inner city?  Where was she?  She was down there in Virginia somewhere, I believe.  And then they moved her to Iowa.  Ah.  To be next to the coach there, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, she did a great job, I gotta say.  You know what sucks about NBC's coverage?  And God forbid you mention this, because...  Yeah, look out, they'll ban you.  They're getting people banned from Twitter and everything.  Fucking assholes.  They split...  They break up the events.  You sit there like, okay, I'll watch this volleyball game, I'm in. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, I know.  And then all of a sudden, like, all right, we'll get back to that, but at first, we gotta  go back to the pool.  It is kind of good, though, when you're watching something you don't like, and they switch  to something you like, because, so, I guess they want to keep people kind of coming back  and seeing what the hell's up.  Maybe you're right, but, I mean, if you're really into something, all of a sudden, like,  you gotta wait an hour for them to go back to it or whatever, or a half hour, it's like,  it's enraging.  I'm just bummed out.  There was no Mikayla last night in the gymnastics, but there was that other Russian chick. 
[00:23:30]  What's her name?  Aaliyah?  What, the progeria one?  No, the progeria one is Victoria or something?  I don't know.  She was a little progeria-looking kid.  And then there's the other Russian girl who towers over the progeria kid, but she's even  a midget.  They are little fucking just freaks of nature.  You like, uh, you like watching, uh, little girls. 
[00:24:00]  No, it's not, you're out of your mind.  You like watching little girls.  You're really into the gymnastics.  They're the highest rated Olympics, summer Olympic sport.  Nope.  There's one bigger.  Basketball?  Nope.  Basketball's a bust because-  Yeah, don't say soccer.  Nope.  Supposedly there's one bigger right now.  Really?  Let me think of what I'm saying.  I'm not volleyball.  Mm-hmm.  What?  By the way, I said the little girl comment was because, uh, uh, toddlers and tiaras and 
[00:24:30]  gymnastics.  Well, toddlers and tiaras are hilarious.  I'm connecting the dots.  I just like when they cry.  I like when they fall down on the stage.  Supposedly, maybe we can look this up.  Archery is the number one.  No way.  I swear to God.  And know why?  This is how stupid, like, human beings in general are.  Not the people we talk to every morning.  Yeah.  Uh, because of Hunger Games.  All of a sudden, people are into archery.  Are you kidding me?  I swear there was a fucking article about this.  There ain't no way. 
[00:25:00]  Because they're like, why are people digging archery?  And they're like, and they made the connection because of those, because of Hunger Games.  That's retarded.  All of a sudden, you're into archery because of a, uh, a fictitious, it started as a book,  right?  Archery.  Archery ratings.  Most viewed Olympic sport on cable.  Yep.  Archery.  Look, is that, is that world?  Or United States?  That's crazy.  That's Hunger Games right there, sir.  That is all because of the Hunger Games.  Archery.  Archery, yeah.  Isn't that stupid? 
[00:25:30]  That is stupid.  Archery.  Oh, well.  Oh, I'm not the only one watching, watching female gymnastics.  Of course not.  See, this girl did a much better job, I think.  And it was just a stupid joke.  Oh, I know.  I think she did a better job.  Look, bam, she's sticking her landings.  She looks more natural.  Yes.  Right?  But maybe they don't like natural?  I don't know.  And Gabby was putting a little, um, she was putting a little dance in it.  Oh. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, and, and, uh, I think this Victoria chick had more, um.  But Victoria's, uh, last name doesn't spell out USA Gold.  No, it certainly doesn't.  It doesn't spell out gold.  It doesn't spell out nothing.  It's called Commie.  It spells out.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, I, I don't know.  She kind of did a better job.  She looks like Victoria a kid.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was the one that looked like she was going to cry at any moment.  Yeah, yeah.  At all times.  Because it came down to she needed a certain score to get the gold. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  Over Gabby.  Right.  And she didn't get it.  She missed it and got the silver medal.  And I think she really thought she had a great chance of getting the gold after this routine because she did such a good job.  She knew it.  Uh, don't you think MMA should be, uh, an Olympic sport?  Yeah, what was that?  With her head.  Popping her chin up.  They go like that before they, bam, look at that.  She stuck that fucking thing perfect.  You liked her, huh?  No, I just thought she did a better job.  You liked her color a little better. 
[00:27:00]  Is that it?  It comes down to race?  I think so.  I think.  You can't even root for, like, America.  I gotta root for the Russians.  Unless they're white.  Because they're white.  Oh, my God.  How bad would that be?  Oh, boy.  By the way, that's a joke, too, with a little reality there.  Just a slight reality.  I gotta go for the Russians because I don't like the idea.  I don't know.  That's terrible.  That's how brutal your racism is.  You actually are rooting for commie country.  I think Gabby Douglas did a great job. 
[00:27:30]  And what's up with Russia?  They put everything back together now?  It's Russia again?  No, there's still the little things like the Ukraine and shit like that.  But there is a Russia thing.  But there's just Russia, yeah.  And that's why they're not at the top of the medal standings, because they broke up the country too much?  Yeah, the Soviet Union used to have, like, Ukrainians and Russians.  It was all those Eastern Bloc nations where they would just take children and put them in pretty much gymnastic concentration camps.  Right. 
[00:28:00]  For four years.  And just have them train, train, train.  Well, then what happened?  Some of them came back together to form a new Russia?  No, Russia was always just Russia.  But they broke it up.  And then it was the Republic of former Soviet states.  Yeah, I can't follow them.  And now they're all pretty much autonomous, you know?  Right.  They're their own deal.  And I don't think they have to be part of a conglomerate anymore, because it's like, enough time has passed.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, she was freaking out.  She was losing her mind. 
[00:28:30]  She was looking for a score.  This is it?  Yeah.  And then when it came out, she just loses her mind.  This is how it came down?  Yeah.  I missed this?  And she got the gold.  And then look at the girl that got the silver, the Russian chick.  She just loses her mind crying.  She couldn't even take it.  Look, there she is.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yeah, she's from Virginia Beach. 
[00:29:00]  Thank you, Neil Hurst.  Yeah, Gabby moved to Iowa.  Well, I'll tell you one thing, not much gangsta in her voice.  Really?  Yeah, she's one of those girls that really just sounds like she is going to get a fuckload of sponsorships.  Yeah, it's perfect.  I mean, Wheaties Box, here you come.  You see her sisters?  No.  You didn't see the sisters in the stands?  Yeah, yeah, I did.  You know those sisters have half her money spent already.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:30]  They're sitting there like, oh, yeah.  Well, let me tell you, my sister, Gabby Douglas.  Right, they might have taken Gabby out of Virginia Beach, but guess what?  There's a few sisters that still have the Virginia Beach in them.  I want to go.  Give me the gold.  Let me see that gold.  Let me see that gold.  Oh, sure.  And she's like, um, I really don't.  Can I go back to my Iowa family?  Right.  My Iowa family.  I don't really like this very much.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you fucking nailed that shit, yo. 
[00:30:00]  I feel bad for Gabby.  Oh, man.  I have a feeling there might be a few handouts.  Oh, no.  As that sponsorship money starts coming in.  We're going to read the story of Gabby at 18.  She's going to be broke.  She's going to be on the cover magazine throwing her hands up like, ah, what happened?  I don't know what happened.  My sister spent my money.  She's got two sisters, right?  I think that's what I saw on the stands.  And they were a bit different looking.  Yeah.  They were a bit different.  A little bit.  They were a bit, if I dare say, um, um, hootish. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  With a few extra pounds on them.  A little, yeah, yeah.  She's.  I'm almost amazed they're all related.  I know.  Poor Gabby.  Oh, Gabby.  I hope her new family just takes her and brings her back to Iowa.  You're right.  She was able to go to the Olympics and get away from all that.  Iowa.  And now it's right back to business as usual.  Amanda in Jersey agrees with Anthony.  The little blonde Russian was robbed of the gold. 
[00:31:00]  That's what I think.  But I'm happy for Gabby.  Yeah.  I mean, it wasn't one of these things where it was like, oh, my God, it was a blowout and  they gave it to the other person.  It was very close from what I saw.  And Gabby did a great job.  And I'm not pissed that she got the medal or anything.  Yeah.  But that Russian chick was perfect.  Like, she really did a great job on it.  If I may talk like a complete flaming faggot here as I talk about women's gymnastics.  And Sam nods his head in agreement. 
[00:31:30]  Well, I was talking about cock bulges with a synchronized daughter.  Well, there you go.  It's the Olympics.  You're allowed to.  We're trying to find the different angles for everybody.  Yeah, come on.  Please leave me alone.  I don't want to just do straight coverage here.  Really?  Geez.  Give us a break.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, there they are.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  They got the fucking flat brim hats with the tags still on them.  They look like their house was just redone by extreme home makeover.  That's every fucking response to Christ. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yes.  But instead, it's their fucking sister.  Because what they're seeing there, they're not seeing gold.  They're not seeing national pride.  They're seeing dollar signs.  Dollar signs.  Oh, shit.  Dollar signs is.  Oh, my God.  The guy's got his hat on weird.  Oh, it's just not going to be good.  Yeah, I know.  Mark our word, this could be a little rough for Gabby down the road.  It could be bad for Gabby.  Next year or two is going to be good.  Next year or two is going to be good.  God.  And then all of a sudden.  Oof.  Oof. 
[00:32:30]  Boy.  I don't know.  I haven't checked one of my favorite websites to see what their opinion is of this.  I can only imagine.  Well, I haven't checked yet.  I will.  But I'm sure they will not be very happy with the whole thing.  Well, it doesn't help that her nickname is the Flying Squirrel.  That allows people to say flying other things.  Oh, no.  It just allows them to say that.  That's fucking very crazy.  It just makes it too easy for people, though, if you think about it.  Oh.  I don't know why the Flying Squirrel.  I guess some of those squirrels jump, right? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I don't see those jumping squirrels.  Where are they?  Because she's little and she's got the teeth and she flies around.  But where are the Flying Squirrels?  In the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons.  Oh, that's not real life.  Yes, it's a new moon spinked.  That's not real life?  No.  No.  So I saw getting a little creeped out that Anthony's on a first-name basis with the gym.  Yeah, that is a little weird.  Well, what am I supposed to do?  You've got to know who I'm talking about.  I know Gabby.  But you've got to know who I'm talking about.  You knew the Russian girl's name.  Well, because I thought she did a good job. 
[00:33:30]  Because it came down to those two.  It came down to those two.  What are you going to do?  All right, there you go.  I was watching it.  And it's defending himself.  I remember.  Gee, I wasn't drinking last night.  I actually remember last night.  I saw the swimming and then they went with men's indoor volleyball.  I'm like, how do you watch that when there's beach volleyball?  There's nothing good about that.  Men's indoor volleyball.  No.  You know, I would imagine that the true, wow, this is going to get people pissed off, 
[00:34:00]  but the true volleyball players are the ones playing indoor and they've been playing indoor  volleyball forever, right?  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden they invent this beach volleyball, you know, which started out as  a goof, like, hey, we're at the beach and why don't we put up a net?  And it turned into something.  It turned into the sport, obviously.  But how do you go back to indoor volleyball when you get to see the girls in the bikinis  and their asses and their...  And two on two is pretty fucking sick, too, you know?  Right.  And they're pulling the wedgies out after every point. 
[00:34:30]  And then you go back to this, like, sterile-looking indoor volleyball.  They've got to be pissed.  Gymnasium squeak under their feet.  Although it is pretty impressive because the whole game is just to try to fucking pound  it into your...  Set up that spike.  ...into your opponent's balls.  They get it in the face.  Yeah, it's on right now, as a matter of fact, the women's.  Yeah, but look, the women's...  Look at that.  You get to see some nice asses.  What short fucking team is...  Oh, okay.  They looked a little short.  Why do you still have a black eye? 
[00:35:00]  Is that from the sport or from our country?  One of the Asian...  One of the Asian chicks have a black eye.  I don't know where they're from, but they're playing Brazil.  Is that the Brazilian team they're playing?  Brazil women just have amazing bodies.  Every single one of them.  Yeah, the asses are...  Oh, man.  That was a nice spike, huh?  In your face right there.  Oh, the shorts on them.  You know, the shorts on the girls' indoor volleyball is all right.  Yeah, they're...  Because they're Brazilians.  You just looked at the asses of the Brazilian girls.  Yeah, because the shorts...  ...wearing those shorts.  They're wearing the same shorts, and they just have shitty asses. 
[00:35:30]  But the Brazil girls, look at that.  God, what the...  It really is something that...  I like the set of their hitters instead of being offensive players.  Let's see what happens.  That coming from a hitter, mind you.  Of course.  Don't steal my glory.  Oh, man.  Here we go.  All right.  And set up and...  Back-to-back points for Sheila and Brazil.  All right, come on.  Do some hugging.  Do some hugging.  There you go.  Bump your genitals together.  Nice.  They're kind of...  They're almost attractive, too, some of the Brazilian girls. 
[00:36:00]  Well, it's tough to compete with their asses.  Yeah, definitely.  So it's almost a letdown every time you see their face after you see the ass?  Yeah.  Does that make sense, kind of?  Yeah.  There's also a Brazilian chick with some pretty big tits.  Because their asses are just spectacular.  Yeah.  What team are they playing?  What?  Hangchua?  The Hangcha province?  Hangcha? 
[00:36:30]  I don't know.  Flying squirrels are real, you dopes.  Flying squirrels are real, but they don't really fly.  They just have that shit underneath their arms and stuff, and they open up their thing,  and they glide back and forth.  That's cool.  They don't really flap their wings.  They don't glide.  I want to know where, though.  Where are they from?  I don't see flying squirrels in New York City.  Where are they indigenous?  Where are they the indigenous?  I don't know.  Really?  Where's the flying squirrels?  Sam?  Comment?  Sam? 
[00:37:00]  Knowledge?  Sam?  Or do you want to talk about Zito again?  Would you rather talk about cool shit or Zito?  I need to know.  I need to know.  What's his name?  I need to know.  We bring up dopes.  Let him just be a dope.  We don't need him on our show.  He's just the anger.  Richmond.  Richmond where?  Pennsylvania, I guess.  It's Redding.  Wait, this is an American thing.  Yeah, they're in America.  Richmond, Virginia?  Have you ever seen a flying squirrel?  Is she from Virginia?  I don't know.  It doesn't... 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, she is.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense, then.  She's from Virginia Beach, I said.  Richmond, Virginia, flying squirrels, then.  And they have a local, like a minor league baseball team, too.  Okay, see?  So it ties in to where she's from and that she's, you know, you see her on the, maybe  the uneven bars.  Yeah.  What else about the Olympics?  What else was on last night?  All I saw was a fuckload of swimming, and that Phelps guy went in his 20th medal.  16 goals?  Yeah.  It's fucking crazy. 
[00:38:00]  And he fucked up a race a couple days ago.  He should have had 17.  Yeah.  He was outtouched because he glided in.  People saw that.  It was like, fuck, dude.  He just coasted.  He coasted.  He coasted.  That fucking snakey move they do off the wall is, like, bizarre.  They got the great underwater cameras on the Olympics, and you just watch them come off  the wall, and they're not even using their arms.  Like, I would think right away you would get back to using your arms if you're doing the  butterfly or the backstroke or whatever the fuck you're doing. 
[00:38:30]  And they do that.  How do you do that?  They look like when you take a pencil and you make it look like, look, I got a rubber  pencil.  And you're shaking your hand.  Look, rubber pencil.  They look like rubber pencil.  It's amazing.  It's fucking amazing.  How did they figure that out?  As much as we're beating the shit out of everything, that is pretty damn amazing.  Holy shit.  Have you ever, like, I don't know, because of the Olympics, you go, you know what?  I'm going to try some of these strokes.  Never.  And you get in a pool.  Oh, and you just seem silly.  And no one's around, and you go, thank God no one's around.  I look like an idiot.  I look like I'm drowning. 
[00:39:00]  Like, no, I'm going to really try to go underwater with that move before I come up and do the  brush stroke.  Yeah.  And you can't do any of it.  I don't know how they go so fast doing that backstroke.  The backstroke, their arms are just going like a fucking paddle boat.  Well, they got rubber arms.  You see when they warm up before they jump in the pool?  Yeah.  They do shit with their arms.  I'm like, how do you do that?  They put their arms totally behind their back.  Right.  And they spin them around in circles, and it doesn't look like your arms should move that  way.  I don't think you're allowed to do military presses if you're a swimmer.  No.  You don't want any muscle around there. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, man, no.  You want everything ligament-y.  It's got to be all just...  Just nothing but ligaments.  Hanging there like a fucking...  Yeah.  Like a G.I.  Joe, where you just take the arm and literally spin it around on that little ball and socket  joint.  I used to do that, and then you spun it around too much, and then all of a sudden the thing  has to pop off.  Yeah, it would pop off.  You fuck up with the metal wiring.  Stick it back in there.  I have an idea for the Olympics.  Would you like to hear it?  Oh.  I think it's a really smart idea, too.  I'm sure they'll take it and run with it. 
[00:40:00]  I hope so.  You know when you go to like SeaWorld?  Yeah.  And you get to go down near the tank, and you get to see like the killer whales underwater?  Underwater.  They should sell seats underwater.  Oh, man.  You mean outside a glass wall?  Yes.  How cool would that be?  That would be for all the pervs.  You think it would distract...  You could see the nip slips and shit in the water polo?  Ugh.  Imagine if they sold underwater, where you get to see that shit.  I'm trying to think.  No? 
[00:40:30]  All right.  But what would you do?  Like, you wouldn't be able to see the goal?  You wouldn't be able to see their faces?  You wouldn't be able to see...  I guess you could have like a TV on the glass so you could see the actual action.  You're there, but you're watching TV because you want to see the underwater.  But it's no different than, you know, half the shit you got to deal with when you  go to a live event.  I got it.  I'm going to go on with your idea, but I'm going to help it out here.  All right, please.  Every seat is on a hydraulic lift. 
[00:41:00]  So as you want to go up and watch the top of the pool, or you can go down and watch the  wall.  All right.  And you go up and down, depending on...  See, this is why we've been doing this for 18 years.  Fantastic idea now.  Look what we do.  Now it's perfect.  Exactly.  You know the pervs would stay underneath, though, the whole time.  Just hoping, I'm going to see some pussy eventually.  And you'd be able to watch up the skirt of the women that are up top in their seats.  We have an upskirt guy that got caught on the subway, speaking of upskirt. 
[00:41:30]  What an idiot.  Poor bastard.  Do you really need to see that so desperately that you set up a pen camera on a...  I guess the guy had a pen camera, and he had it in the newspaper.  And then he's, like, kind of moving around, trying to, you know, get upskirts.  Are upskirts that good?  I'm not one for upskirts.  It's like...  In a way, it's kind of cool to check out, but not to the point where you're now trying  to fucking do it.  If there's an inadvertent upskirt that you're looking somewhere, you're on the train, you're 
[00:42:00]  on whatever...  It's great.  Also, you're like, hey, that was a nice trip today.  But I wouldn't search it out to clandestinely film it.  No.  Or anything.  But the...  Yeah, the upskirt's pretty cool if you just catch it.  Right.  But to go out of your way to actually start filming it...  Film it or go to a website to just look at upskirts.  No.  It's a little silly.  They're so much better to look.  Yeah, you throw a little upskirt in with your...  A little prelim.  With your porn viewing, but...  Yeah, that's how you start off.  A little foreplay with yourself. 
[00:42:30]  A little appetizer, maybe, you know?  Before you start really cranking it.  Yeah, a little cheese and crackers before the main dish.  Yeah.  Appetizer, right.  All right, so they're finally doing track and field starting today?  Is it today?  Finally.  Black Olympics starting up then.  I like that.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, it's just...  I mean, why do the white women even bother running on some of those races?  You see the track?  Yeah.  When they're fucking...  Any running event is ridiculous.  Yeah.  All black chicks just fucking crossing that finish line. 
[00:43:00]  I love how everyone hates stereotypes.  Not everyone, but the idiots out there...  Yeah.  ...get really pissed when you stereotype.  But look at the Olympics.  Black chicks are fast, man.  But look at the Olympics.  Yeah.  I swear you, I tweeted when I...  I saw one black swimmer.  Yeah.  But you say, oh, blacks don't really like swimming.  You know, they'll kill you.  Yep.  It's like, hey, you know...  And then they bring up one or two instances.  It's like, I'm not saying every...  Right.  And then you go to track and field, and most of the medals will be won by black people. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  That is a fact.  Yep.  That's how that works.  You know?  I don't know why.  Perhaps you could take it all the way back to the old days when...  All right.  Well, what...  I won't go into...  Well, the other side of the argument, they would say, well, blacks just didn't have the  same, you know, facilities and the same opportunities.  Because I guess maybe to take up swimming is a lot more expensive than just going out  there and running. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  That's what people would say, though.  They would say that.  But coastal cities, that's where, you know, a lot of black people grew up.  The coastal cities.  And there's a lot of water.  A lot of water.  A lot of water.  It's going on.  I don't know.  Chicago's on a lake.  Jesus.  Fucking New York City's right there on the Atlantic Ocean.  You want to hear from a guy that had a flying squirrel for eight years?  Why do you have a flying squirrel?  All right.  Hey, Bullwinkle.  You're on the air.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:44:30]  Trucker Scott.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, Scott.  What's going on?  What do you got for the show today?  I got a pet flying squirrel for eight years.  He was really cool.  He used to ride around in my shirt pocket.  You know, I could carry him around with me.  Chick magnet.  He would climb up the curtain and jump and then, you know, fly down.  To the floor.  The dude was lightning fast.  But, yeah, he was a lot of fun.  He would glide inside the house? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  If he could get, you know, 10, 12 feet up, yeah, he'd leap off the curtain rod and just  it's almost like a parachute type of thing.  Dude, where would he glide to?  That would be frightening.  Right.  He's just, ah, he's coming at me.  And there's something else going on here, too.  But answer Ant's question, please.  Sure.  Where would he glide to?  Where would he glide to?  Would he glide at you?  To the floor, onto other furniture, sometimes onto me.  That would be scary. 
[00:45:30]  If I wanted to leave and I wanted to put him back in his cage, he sometimes didn't want  to go back in his cage.  It was like a man scrambled, get the damn squirrel put away so I could leave.  Yeah.  You know what?  You know what he was telling you?  Hey, asshole, put me outside.  Oh, yeah.  Poor little thing.  I want to be outside.  I'm giving you all the hints.  I don't want to go back in my cage and I'm climbing, you know, as high as I can in your  shitty fucking house to try to glide a little.  Chick magnet, though, dude?  Well, he was actually born in captivity. 
[00:46:00]  Huh?  He was bred in captivity by a breeder.  Oh, I was just making a dumb joke.  Another dumb joke.  Don't take it seriously.  You know, if he was put back in the wild, he wouldn't last very long.  Oh, those people?  Yeah.  They can't be put back into the wild.  They won't even last a day out there.  They don't have the skills to defend.  I think they do deep down their DNA.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they'll figure it out.  When push comes to shove, I think that deep down DNA shit kicks in.  That squirrel, that little squirrel's being chased by something.  He's going to scurry up a tree. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  He's going to know how to do that.  Oh, yeah.  I think he'll figure something out.  All right, Trucker Scott.  Always a pleasure.  I know you're a regular and enjoy your ride wherever the fuck you're going to today.  I got a quick question for you.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, sure.  It might have been good.  Let me see if he's still there.  That was probably stupid.  You think?  Yeah.  After Gabby won the gold medal, they went to a commercial where a blank was doing blanks.  I didn't see that commercial.  There's no way that happened, right? 
[00:47:00]  I don't know.  Did you see the swimmer there?  She's a little older, 25 years old.  I don't know their names.  Yeah, she was...  What's her name?  She was going against...  What's her name?  Franklin there.  And she won the gold.  And she broke the world record.  And it was the first time she was under...  Water?  Under a certain time.  Yeah.  It was a milestone.  And then they went to a commercial where this girl is watching the Olympics on her phone. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And they show the race that you just saw.  How they do that.  And then, whatever the time was, this girl writes it on her board.  Because she's a swimmer, too.  And that's like, oh, here's my new goal.  I got...  This is the world record.  And then leaves the house like she's going to swimming practice, basically.  Oh.  Holy fuck.  Incorporating the...  Well, it wasn't the live event, right?  Well, they had enough...  What did they have?  Six hours or whatever it would be?  Six hour lead time. 
[00:48:00]  To put it together.  But I thought that was kind of impressive.  Some people were pissed off by that.  I was like, that's all right.  That's a little different.  This is live track and field, huh?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Did the Olympic Committee just go, look, we want everyone to wear the smallest fucking  uniforms, whatever you want to call them, ever.  They seem a lot...  That's all muscle.  But they seem a lot smaller, don't they?  They really do.  These Olympics?  Yeah.  Because now the track and field stuff they're wearing is like, literally, they're wearing 
[00:48:30]  nothing.  What is she doing?  That looks weird.  That's what they do.  The high jump.  That's what they do before the high jump.  Try to get her step going?  Yeah.  It's a run, skip thing.  She doesn't look happy with anything.  Whoa.  She did it?  She did it?  It looks like a dumb sport.  That high jump is a little...  Where is she from?  France?  That's good, too.  The Olympics are teaching me flags of different nations.  Oh, really?  I just...  I know the United States and a couple other.  But then you see, it's like, oh, Latvia. 
[00:49:00]  Latvia's a red flag with a white stripe across it.  I hope that's Latvia.  That looks like a Latvian chick.  Holy Christ.  Remember learning flags in school?  Why did we have to do that?  Oh, flags.  Yeah.  Why did we have to do that?  Ah.  Were you good at learning flags?  No.  I hated it.  Terrible.  There were too many that kind of looked alike.  Yeah, the big book of flags.  Just go through pages and pages of them.  And then your brain would just explode.  Like, you would know Japan.  You would know, like, America. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, those are easy ones.  I don't know.  Who's this blonde?  Who's this blonde?  Where's she from?  Russia.  Another fucking Russian.  I jump over to the bar for you.  Pretty good.  See, this is...  I'm here just to make money to go back and...  Look at those abs.  That's a little too much, right?  Oh, man.  She's kind of pretty in a Russian way.  This is all right in the face.  Yeah, I kind of like this one.  This might be one of my favorites.  It's nonsense.  They're at a height everyone could do. 
[00:50:00]  Christina Savitskandige falaketuskov.  Oh, this is I from Ukraine.  She from Ukraine.  Oh, man.  She's a little...  Might be some fucking hormone therapy going on with her.  Wow.  Wow.  Wowie kazowie.  Natalia Dobrynskiarovsky.  The face isn't that bad.  Nah.  The face was all right.  Why are they all wearing fluorescent shoes, too?  Is that the new thing?  Oh, man. 
[00:50:30]  They're all wearing them.  Is that...  I don't know.  That's weird.  Yeah, we're now just watching the high jump.  So to keep fucking riffraff off of there?  If they dress up and jump in with the people?  You need the fluorescent shoes or else you'd chase down?  Maybe.  Yeah.  All right.  That's our Olympic coverage.  Oh, the men's basketball team.  I hope you like it.  I knew there was something else.  Oh, would they just blow everybody out?  Oh, they beat Nigeria by 83 points.  By 83 points?  Yeah, 156-73. 
[00:51:00]  A record for points scored in the Olympic game.  That's funny.  And, you know, the U.S. team getting a lot of heat for running up the score.  What are they supposed to do?  But they were playing their scrubs.  Not play.  They were playing their scrubs.  Oh, you're the scrubs.  Yeah, the scrubs are all-stars.  Right.  So what are they supposed to do?  It's a whole team of all-stars, right?  Yeah, and I guess LeBron and Kobe Bryant, you know, obviously two of the bigger names,  if not the biggest names on the team.  They didn't even play.  All right.  So they sat them out.  What are they fucking complaining about? 
[00:51:30]  I know the whole fourth quarter and I think part of the third quarter.  So what are they complaining about?  And then supposedly they were trying to slow down the action.  But, you know, you've got to take a shot every 24 seconds.  You can't just dribble the ball until, you know, the clock runs out.  And they were making all their shots.  Because maybe a couple of the players or maybe the coach got one of those e-mails  that said, you have $10 million here in Nigeria.  Please send us your contact information.  Realize we scammed.  Yeah.  And this was his little payback. 
[00:52:00]  That was our way of getting everyone back.  Get them back.  Getting that country back.  Yes.  What they've done to everyone.  Fuckers.  I'm all for just running up the score in every sport.  Yeah.  From Little League to, you know, the majors.  Hey, they came to play.  So did the other team.  Right.  I'm all for it.  And here's what it's about.  I'm all for it.  I'm hoping my kid gets into sports someday.  And, you know, if he's on a team where he gets his ass kicked, so be it.  Hey, Nigeria, step it up then.  What do you want?  I mean.  You want a team that's not going to play at their best so you can feel good about yourself? 
[00:52:30]  Well, I guess they're supposed to really just start sucking on purpose near the end.  It's ridiculous.  So it doesn't hurt as much.  I hate that strategy.  I fucking hate that.  I love when games, you know, get out of hand like this.  It's terrible.  I don't know.  Basketball just seems weird in the Olympics.  Why?  I don't know.  Because we're used to seeing it here and everything.  It's not like a special.  Oh, look.  It's an Olympic sport.  It's something you don't see all the time.  Do you like the special sports?  Yeah, I do like the shit that you just don't see all the time. 
[00:53:00]  They should do MMA.  It's pretty obvious they should do that.  Yeah, they got MMA guys from around the world.  Olympic MMA.  That would be amazing.  Are you kidding me?  So violent.  I don't know.  You saw the judo, right?  A judo chop.  A judo.  A judo chop.  A judo.  Yeah, I saw some of that judo.  With the woman that I guess was touched when she was training as a child or something.  Yeah, and then she lost her shit when she had the gold or something.  Yeah, I don't know.  They're making a big deal that she was touched by her ex-trainer or something.  Why would you go into a sport? 
[00:53:30]  Oh, by her trainer?  Yeah, yeah.  Eek.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think she's lying.  You know what?  I had something, too.  I got scared of what I wanted to say.  What did you want to say?  Come on.  The trainer might need glasses.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, that.  Did she lose her mind, yeah?  Yeah, she lost her mind.  It was a big deal.  I don't know if we're good at judo, usually.  I think this was a big deal that we won gold in judo. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And that's it.  And then that rowing.  That rowing is who gives a fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  What sports do you really care about?  Well, obviously, women's gymnastics.  Right.  Since I knew the names of the gals.  Rowing, I don't give a fuck about.  Some swimming, I don't give a fuck about.  Some of the swimming, yes.  Beach volleyball, I'm all in.  Not all these fucking heats.  I like the fucking, when they go for the gold in the swimming, it's pretty exciting.  Yes, absolutely. 
[00:54:30]  All that shit is pretty good.  I don't think they need the preliminaries.  I think they should just run the medal matches.  Isn't the preliminaries why they're there?  Huh?  Isn't that why they're there in the first place?  They've done enough preliminaries to make it to the Olympics?  You would think.  Let's just have a...  No, you could do that preliminaries when no one's watching.  When no one's watching.  And then show us the real shit.  Yeah.  Let's have some elimination.  Pretty well in terms of throw.  If you throw the person, they're not quite on the back, lay on the side.  All right, pause.  We call that a yuko, a half point. 
[00:55:00]  What's wrong with the guy's voice?  Well, he sounds like...  Is he a judo guy that took too many fucking feet to the teeth?  Maybe.  You hear that?  Yeah, something going on.  Let's go.  There's lesser quality scores.  Is it going on?  Very good attack.  That will be a score.  That's a yuko.  Is it yuko?  To score any longer.  Now you're going to basically try to take the person out, but don't expose yourself so much.  Very good attack.  Hey.  It's some yuggy.  But Kayla Steele needs the control. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  I can't hear his voice.  Oh, and the weightlifter with the elbow that turned inside out.  I heard about this.  I didn't see that.  You got that somewhere, Sam?  Then we can finally move on another day.  Those are fucking hard to watch.  Oh, you know what?  Kevin makes a good point while Sam finds that.  Kevin in South Carolina.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  I don't care about the Olympics, but I find it ironic that the badminton team got in trouble for not trying. 
[00:56:00]  And the basketball team got in trouble for trying.  Please explain.  Yeah, what is it going to be, Olympics?  What is it going to be?  Do you want them to try or not try?  Because the badminton...  I like how you said that, too.  The badminton...  Badminton.  The badminton people got in trouble for not trying.  Yeah.  And the basketball team getting in trouble for trying a little too hard.  For trying a little too hard.  Trying a little too much.  Is this it, Sam?  Oh, is this it?  His elbow goes?  I don't know if I can watch this.  Which elbow?  When the knees and the elbows...  I can tell you.  Huh?  Damn it.  He's not going to tell us which elbow.  You know what? 
[00:56:30]  When the knees...  Go full screen, you fuck.  Yes, sir.  I just want to preface this by saying, when the knees and elbows do something they're  not supposed to do, it's one of my things.  I have a real tough time.  You're fucked up, huh?  You should...  I have a real tough time watching this shit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I'm ready.  Go.  We're done.  Maybe it's four.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  It popped.  Damn it!  You saw it go like...  Oh, is he in pain?  I can't see that.  Oh, look.  He's picking it.  Oh, you went backwards with it. 
[00:57:00]  I thought he was all better in picking it up backwards.  It's one of my things.  I can't see that.  Oh, man.  It just...  Right there.  Look.  It just gives up.  Oh.  That looks like a career ender.  Yeah, I don't know how you come back.  We're done.  Maybe it's four.  Look at him.  He's yelling, laying on the floor.  He's done.  Oh, God.  That poor fucker.  Can you hear him yell?  No. 
[00:57:30]  No, not really.  Damn it.  That's too bad.  We're done.  Maybe it's four.  Oh, fuck.  Logan says there's a ping-pong player named Ding-Ding.  Great.  Well, Destiny Hooker on the volleyball team, too.  Yeah, Destiny Hooker.  There's a Destiny Hooker.  She has some parents with a sense of humor.  Fucking cruel.  Why would you do that?  Like, what?  She's an Olympic athlete?  We weren't gunning for that when we named her.  Right.  When you have a last name Hooker, you've got to really be careful with that one. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  You really do.  Mm-hmm.  Did you see all the pictures that are coming out of the Olympics where people are really  having fun with it?  Tweeting?  What?  Well, like the one where they put the bar to make it all like they're all nude and shit  and really awkward poses and stuff.  Oh, right, right.  They just eliminate their little attire.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a bar basically saying what the event is or whatever, but when you stop some of that 
[00:58:30]  shit, you know, some of the pictures that come out are really funny.  It looks like they're nude.  Nude.  Nude.  Mm.  Rawl.  I'm starving.  Yeah, let's eat.  Let's eat.  We've talked about the Olympics.  Oh, yeah.  I'll say Japanese.  This guy said Jap.  For the record, he said Jap.  Madden Indy.  A Japanese player named Take Shida.  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's on the jersey. 
[00:59:00]  Take Shida?  Take Shida spelled out.  I bet it's Takashida.  Well, I think it's Take Shida.  Do you think it's Takashida?  I bet it's like Takashida or something, right?  No, it's Take Shida.  It's Takashida.  No, who's that?  Yeah, it's another guy.  Another Take Shida.  I didn't know there were Take Shidas.  That looks like the guy that runs Nakatomi Corporation.  Runs some dumb fucking corporation.  Yeah.  Takashida.  I saw Take Shida. 
[00:59:30]  I absolutely saw Take Shida.  It's Takashida.  What?  It's Takashida, right?  Yeah, I see that.  I think.  No, look how it's spelled.  Take Shida.  That's how it's spelled?  Yeah, it is.  I'm American, man.  I pronounce that Take Shida.  Take Shida.  It's very mature.  It's not that it's mature.  That's how you say shit.  Of course it is.  Let them pronounce it their way.  I'll pronounce it our way. 
[01:00:00]  And I mean our meaning America's way.  America.  I don't feel that national pride, are you?  Well, yeah.  But if you read from Salon.com, some asshole on there was talking about how it's bad for  the United States to chant like USA, USA and wrap themselves on the flag because other  countries look at us and all that we have here and how affluent and rich of a nation we  are and it's like rubbing it in their face when we chant. 
[01:00:30]  You're kidding, right?  No, this is actually the truth.  What about all the other countries yelling their version of USA?  It's okay because they're not as rich as us and it's just sour grapes.  I'm so glad.  We did that story on Red Eye last night and it was just like, yeah, there it is.  Don't chant USA.  This guy's kidding, right?  No.  Is it a guy, a girl?  He's a fucking, he's so left-leaning liberal, this guy.  And the lefties hate anything to do with pride in the country. 
[01:01:00]  Sorry, they just do.  Why is he getting attention for this dumb story?  Because some of this shit is just dumb stories.  I know, because it was on Red Eye.  No, no, but I'm glad you guys brought it up because, you know, you'll beat the shit out  of the guy.  That's what I'm talking about.  But some of this stuff is just out there and no one beats the shit out of him for writing  an article like this.  It is just ridiculous.  Fuck that guy.  Of course.  Is he anyone? 
[01:01:30]  Or are you just a blogger?  Nah, he's just a dumb fucking writer on Salon.  Salon.  There's some fruit.  Uh, USA.  There was something else about that.  National Pride.  Nah, whatever.  USA.  Yeah, that's dumb.  Yeah.  Well, let's eat.  I'd say.  I would say.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Thumbs up or down on wings, Ant? 
[01:02:00]  They had a couple.  They had a couple of good ones.  This one ain't it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm not a big fan of this one.  Which one would you have played?  Let me see.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, God.  Keep going.  Yeah.  All right.  You got to go with this one.  I would go Jet. 
[01:02:30]  Jet.  That's a good one.  Nicole's going to go in a second.  We'll get back to our wings.  Hey.  Wow, what's wrong with you today?  Nothing.  I just, I'm cold in there and I didn't put my makeup on yet.  I was home late.  You're very tan.  I am very tan, right?  Very tan.  That's what happens in the summertime.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You're fucked up.  I'm not fucked up.  I did not go out of it.  You are so fucked up.  I swear on my dog's life.  Your eyes are all like droopy-ish and weird.  Because I didn't put my makeup on yet.  This is Nicole.  And the boys. 
[01:03:00]  That's you.  It's Nicole from Morning Mashup.  I swear on everything, Girl Scouts Honor, that I did not do anything last night.  I've decided you're the only reason to listen to the Morning Mash.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  The rest of those people are just, they're just nonsense.  There's no loyalty.  That's how people have woken up to you.  Yeah.  It's not pretty, right?  You just wake up like that.  It's just been a long week.  And so, you know, it gets uglier and uglier as we go on.  No, you're very natural.  You got the natural beauty there. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, you do.  What happened about a week ago when, uh, am I allowed to bring it up on the air where  you're motherfucking your husband of two weeks and said that it's over and I don't know.  I did never say it was over.  I would never call off my marriage.  Like, no.  No, no, no.  You said something about a huge fight.  Yeah.  Should I bring this up on the air or no?  Yeah.  I don't remember what it was.  It's too late now.  You were fucked up again.  How do you know I was messed up? 
[01:04:00]  We can tell.  I don't come into work messed up.  No.  Well, you come into work immediately after you were messed up.  Yeah.  You're officially not.  You're officially still not partying.  But we watch you walk down this hall.  Yeah.  And you'll bump into.  You realize you bump into the glass wall some morning.  Dude, nobody gets used to these hours.  There you go.  It's hard, dude.  Good point.  I'm with you on that.  I'm still sleeping right now.  Especially when you're all fucked up right before.  Oh, man.  Shut up.  It makes it tougher is what I'm saying.  It does make it a little bit tougher.  I have a rule. 
[01:04:30]  As long as you fell asleep.  Then, yes.  Then you're not fucked up.  Yeah.  As long as you get like an hour or two, you're good.  So if I was like partying until 3 a.m.  Yeah.  And then I get up at 4.  It's a new day.  Right.  You're done.  I'm not fucked up.  I was fucked up last night.  Right.  You swept it off.  Oh, yeah.  But an hour ago.  Was I fucked up last night?  Even though last night was an hour ago.  You two are very similar in your partying ways.  Are we?  How do you know about my partying ways?  We see it, Nicole. 
[01:05:00]  We all see it.  We see it.  We all see it.  You do.  We all see it.  In your little studio over here.  We all see it.  We all see it.  But I'll tell you this.  I bow to you and Anthony.  I don't know how you guys do it.  I don't either.  I really don't.  I can't do it as much as I used to.  No way.  It hurts so bad.  I can't do it.  I'm getting old.  I'm going to be 30 at the end of this month.  Oh, man.  Yes!  My life's over.  My life's over.  That is it.  I know.  The fucking wall has been hit.  What happened with the fight, though?  You had some kind of crazy fight because you were, like, yelling. 
[01:05:30]  You were just bitching to whoever would listen as you were walking down the hall.  And I happened to be coming out of the bathroom.  You said that you or he slept on the couch.  And it's over.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck that guy.  I did.  I'm like, wow, I didn't ask for any of this.  You slept on the couch?  I don't remember what the fight was about.  It was probably something really, really stupid.  You guys shouldn't be couching it at this early juncture.  Well, when you still party, sometimes you get into angry drunk fights.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Could happen.  Yeah.  That's honesty.  That's honesty.  I don't remember what it was.  I remember those. 
[01:06:00]  When you were cursing at each other over text.  Yeah, I love to do that.  I'm a good text fighter.  Are you a text fighter?  Oh, my God.  I hate a text fight.  It's the best.  Can you tell him the atomic bomb you dropped on him?  What?  About what he wasn't good at?  Oh, no.  Can I say it?  What wasn't he good at?  It's got to be close to you, right?  Okay, say it.  Because if you don't remember, it's not a big deal.  I'm going to guess assy.  Oral.  What are you his second of?  I have no idea.  Well, he got married before.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they were fighting with each other.  Oh, yeah.  And she said, well, obviously, you're not very good at picking wives, are you? 
[01:06:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Wait a minute.  Wasn't that a low blow?  Isn't that good?  And he was like, what the fuck is your problem?  Yeah.  Why would you say that?  I just married you.  He was mad at me and yelling at me.  And I was like, well, clearly you suck at picking wives.  Well, isn't that kind of beating on yourself?  Well, he was telling me I suck and I was a stupid bitch.  Like, oh, okay, you turned it around.  So I was like, fine.  Man, you turned that right around.  Right, didn't I?  Your relationship sounds exhausting.  I saw you at Sam's wedding with him and he's a nice guy.  Yeah.  But I was looking at you two going, wow, that's got to be exhausting to be either one of them. 
[01:07:00]  We're both pretty exhausting.  So, I mean, I can't say that I'm any better than him.  You've been married how long?  Two months.  Going strong.  Wow.  Going strong.  What did I say?  When lasts a year?  Shut up.  You said it when lasts a year, yeah.  I really have to go.  Prove me wrong.  I will prove you wrong.  I would like to be proven wrong.  I'll have a nice baby bump.  We'll be modeling down the hall instead of bumping into a...  Are you going to be bumping soon or what?  I don't know.  We'll see.  You're thinking of bumping, huh?  He wants to bump. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Are you going wrong?  No.  Oh, yeah.  But, I mean, I'm on birth control.  Oh.  Oh, he's wrong.  By the way, though, you can still drink when you're pregnant.  No, you can't.  Okay.  You know what?  I'm not drinking when I'm pregnant.  All of our parents did.  Yeah.  And they smoked butts, too.  They did.  Smoking them butts.  They used to smoke in the delivery room.  Oh, I can't even think about it.  I know.  It's disgusting.  Get some old doctors on the phone.  They'll tell you.  And supposedly you could have, like, a glass of wine every day or something.  Yeah.  You could definitely have, like, a glass of wine, but you can't, like, have a lot 
[01:08:00]  of glasses of wine, which I like to do.  I went on.  I can't.  Are you finishing me?  I have to go.  Yeah.  If you get pregnant, you're going to have to, like, get rid of all your partying.  Does that scare you?  Yeah.  A hundred percent.  And I mean all of your partying.  A hundred percent.  Terrified.  Terrified.  You know all of it.  I know all of it.  I get it out.  Not just the drinking he's saying.  I didn't say that.  I'm leaving now.  I didn't say that.  I love you, boys.  How do you think the mashup sounds right now without her?  Awful. 
[01:08:30]  Horrible.  Oh, it's just shit.  But those guys could all be doing other things.  They just.  Wow.  She is, like, dark.  She's, like, negro dark.  Almost.  Like, the top of her hand is very dark, and you can definitely see where the palm of her  hand is lighter, like a black person.  Yeah, she gets real dark in the summer.  She gets that dark.  She's all right, but I don't know.  That would be exhausting.  She's out of her mind.  I bet she was crazy in her early 20s.  Oh, you get her talking about her early 20s.  Just fucking. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  And fucking drugs and alcohol.  She's a very loose woman back then.  She doesn't hold back.  Anyway, can you turn on wings again, please?  So you would go with this one?  I like this one.  But then I also, what was their biggest hit ever?  Maybe I'm amazed at the way.  That's a fucking good one right there.  What about Where So Sorry?  No, I'm not big on that one. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, this is a huge one.  Oh, of course.  This is a theme to a James Bond movie.  I'm going to let die.  Let me see.  I'll tell you what.  Silly love songs.  With a little luck.  Band on the Run is probably one of the bigger ones.  Band on the Run was pretty good.  This ever-changing world.  Shit.  Anyway, what?  Paul McCarty announced the formation of Wings 41 years ago.  41?  41 years ago. 
[01:10:00]  Jesus.  He went from the Beatles to Wings.  That wasn't too bad for him.  Not bad.  He didn't really have a drop-off.  No.  Some of the other guys had a drop-off.  Ringo.  I'm not naming names.  Ringo.  That sucks.  George Harrison even did well.  You know?  He got a few hits and collaborated.  George Harrison was extremely talented.  He really was.  John Lennon was just a weirdo.  Sorry.  Not into John Lennon.  No?  Like, into the Beatles.  Into a couple of John Lennon tunes. 
[01:10:30]  But for the most part, he's just a little too weird.  Well, you've got to give it.  You've got to give it up for Imagine.  But after that, I don't like any of his stuff, really.  Yeah, it's kind of, ugh.  I think you're right.  He turned really, like, eating.  And then even, like, right before he died, I didn't like that.  Nobody told me the Beatles like these.  Nobody told me the Beatles like these.  Nobody told me the Beatles like these.  I hate that song.  It doesn't fit.  Words don't even fit.  You've got to fit too many words in.  I know. 
[01:11:00]  Nobody told me the Beatles like these.  I hate that song.  Nobody told me there would be days like these.  Nobody told me there would be days like these.  I love when this show picks up on the dumbest little things.  I hate that thing.  You know how many people are saying badminton?  Badminton.  Badminton.  Badminton.  Entenman.  I like eating Entenmans when I watch Padminton.  I was hoping to say this before Sam got back in the studio.  Uh-oh.  I got killed for the Krispy Kreme thing on Twitter yesterday. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, with the light and the day-old donuts.  Day-old donuts being just as good as...  Even my wife going, you don't understand.  It melts into your mouth when they're fucking fresh out of the oven.  Yeah.  I'm like, fuck.  She's like, almost cotton candy-ish how that kind of just...  Oh, man.  I'm like, fuck.  Yeah?  You're lucky I'm not the type of guy to say I told you so.  And then some assholes are like, hey, uh...  You are.  If you reheat a donut, you know the glides will be all fucked up. 
[01:12:00]  All right, man.  I was just having a little fun with Krispy Kreme yesterday.  They're killing me.  Krispy Kremes.  But, uh, uh, Rollins donuts?  Yeah, those...  Right?  No.  I didn't want to kill him because he went all the way to Bed-Stuy, but...  Fuck him.  They sucked and I didn't even eat it.  The chocolate one saved it because, I mean, you can't fuck up chocolate.  You can put chocolate on anything.  It's going to taste good.  Right, because there's a pound of chocolate frosting on it.  But the other one, I had the cafe latte, whatever, with the...  Cafe latte. 
[01:12:30]  And I love brown sugar.  I'm a big brown sugar fan.  Oh.  Brown sugar.  I'm better.  Yeah.  Yeah, I am a big fan of that shit.  Um...  I didn't like it as much.  I couldn't even fucking deal with looking at it.  I knew what they would taste like.  Too fucking art house.  It's too fucking homemade-ish.  I don't want that.  I like an assembly line stamping shit out.  That shocked me yesterday that you don't like homemade goods.  No, I'm not a homemade guy.  I'm a huge fan of the homemade baked goods.  Give me an Entenmann's cake and, um... 
[01:13:00]  And chocolate...  Now that Jimmy's not here, we can have this conversation.  As far as chocolate chip cookies go...  Look at this.  Chips, what's that?  As far as chocolate chip cookies go, I would rather have Chips Ahoy or some kind of store-bought  chocolate chip cookie over one of those that were made in the oven.  Well, let me explain the made in the oven.  All right.  Because that's my side of this argument.  Yeah.  The lumpy fucking homemade chocolate chip cookie? 
[01:13:30]  You'd rather have a Chips Ahoy?  There are always these flat fucking cookies.  Oh, who is this needy fuck?  Oh, what the fuck?  Who's this?  That's Rob.  He killed the man who won't be named yesterday.  Rob did a great job yesterday, and now he's fucking it up with this ass-kissing move?  This ham-handed maneuver to garner fucking likability?  Let me explain Rob's stock.  Yeah.  It's pretty much like Facebook.  He came out of the gate, and he tells the story about banging that broad, but he made  the mistake of saying he put a couple fingers in their asshole, and then I said to myself, 
[01:14:00]  okay, this guy's completely fucking lying.  Pants on fire.  Good-looking kid probably does all right, but I don't think he fucked that blonde that  day.  He swears he does.  It's okay.  I bet he did.  I don't want him around.  And then yesterday, he destroys that Zito character.  I don't want to say his name.  So now the stock is really nice.  Nice.  He's got...  His stock is up.  High potential.  But now today, he's looking all needy.  You got baked goods in front of us?  On Wednesday, my mom said that she's going to make some cookies for you guys. 
[01:14:30]  I wonder where she got that idea.  She said it on Wednesday, not yesterday.  I wonder where she got that idea.  Honing in on Mrs. Roberts, and not the new Mrs. Roberts.  Right.  The older...  Well, not the old.  I don't mean age-wise.  I mean, the original Mrs. Roberts.  Wow.  Well, who doesn't bake for us anymore?  Yeah.  Well, because you called her a C-word.  I mean, she has a reason not to bake for you.  I didn't call her a C-word.  You played a button with Mel Gibson calling her the C-word.  Oh, Jesus.  But we hugged at your wedding.  Well, I mean, she's a polite lady. 
[01:15:00]  No.  She was just being nice at her son's wedding.  We had a good time.  Trust me.  She's very angry with this program, I would say.  We had a really good time.  You asked her how she styles her pubic hair.  I didn't do that.  And you asked her what she looks like when she gets out of the shower.  That was Anthony.  I did not.  We're individuals.  You probably did.  We're individuals.  So, what did I do and what did Anthony do?  Well, you called her to give...  I mean, Anthony has never said, hey, let's call your mom.  So I'm the bad guy again?  Yeah, true.  Well, you can't...  When am I not the bad guy?  You can't set up... 
[01:15:30]  Why do I always have to be the bad guy?  You can't set up Anthony to be the bad guy without being a little bit of the bad guy.  He was talking about her pubic hair.  That's pretty bad.  But that'd be like me being like, hey, Roland, you should prank Eric.  And then me being like, oh, I didn't do anything.  Because Roland pranked you.  I'm not saying I'm not, you know, a little guilty here.  Right.  I just don't want to be the number one bad guy all the fucking time.  No, you're a bad guy, not the number one bad guy.  You were talking about your mom naked in the shower with the steam and everything.  Why are you selling me out?  Because I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.  I've never said that my mom is friends with Anthony. 
[01:16:00]  Anthony is also not claiming to be...  What?  ...her friend.  Oh, we're friends.  Oh, man.  We're friends.  You've got to do some work.  You're getting nice to her.  We text a lot.  You text a lot?  Anyway, what do you got there, sir?  Well, my mom made...  How old's your mom?  She's 46.  Nice.  Seriously?  Uh-oh.  I don't know what that means for you guys.  She's a fellow child of the 80s.  I think so, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not quite. 
[01:16:30]  She's right there.  How old are you?  21.  Yeah.  You're...  46?  That falls right in there.  It's fine.  I can have old kids?  Yeah.  Oh, if you would have started earlier.  Holy fuck.  You could easily...  This could easily be your son.  Oh, my God.  Like, easily.  Your mom go to Geneseo?  No.  Okay.  We're good.  I would definitely not be able to live the lifestyle that I've become accustomed if I would have had kids earlier on,  because it would just be too embarrassing. 
[01:17:00]  I don't know.  In a weird way, I think it would work.  I don't know.  Have you had, like, a 20-something at that compound with you coming over?  Because you'd have to hear, oh, damn, Dad.  He could scout.  He could go out scouting.  Uh-huh.  Sam's getting beat up.  Boo-hoo.  Other people bake.  I'm just saying.  I wonder where his mom got that idea from.  Travis, what do you got?  You got any brothers or sisters?  Yeah.  Sister?  Uh, yes.  How old?  Well, one's 24. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Or 25.  That's too old for her.  That's the other one.  16.  You got a picture of her?  Let's see.  Because you're a good-looking guy.  Is she cute?  Throw it on a Facebook.  Is she cute?  No, not really.  Well, you don't know because you're a brother.  No.  Yeah.  Let's check this out.  She's kind of a porker.  I bet she is.  What?  She's a little bit of a porker.  It could be baby fat.  You're calling your sister fat on an international radio show?  It could be baby fat.  That goes away.  You worked that shit off.  Is someone getting arrested today?  Why is that guy wandering around like he needs business?  He's that security. 
[01:18:00]  He's a fire marshal.  That's a fire marshal?  I think so.  No, he's one of the security guys for fucking Rockefeller Center.  Wearing the white shirt?  Yeah.  So why is he up here?  This isn't Rockefeller Center.  That's what I'm getting at.  But they're all rock center fucking security guys, I think.  He just looks like one of those guys you see every once in a while from the NYPD.  I'm going to say fire marshal.  That's, uh...  Hey, is she with Nick Jonas?  She is.  Fuck yeah.  She goes out with Nick Jonas?  I saw him in the airport.  She goes out with Nick Jonas.  That's pretty fucking cool.  That's all right. 
[01:18:30]  Good for you.  Fuck Nick Jonas.  But I can't see the porker part.  That's hilarious.  That's an older picture.  Aw, look.  Boy, she sure likes Nick Jonas.  Yeah, she gets to meet Nick Jonas so many times.  I don't know.  She went to that play that he's in.  Her music.  Yeah, but she just took a picture with him on stage.  She does like every Nick Jonas thing.  How'd she swing that?  It's like you and Rob Zombie.  I love Rob Zombie.  Where's the 24-year-old?  She doesn't have a Facebook, actually. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Well, that's good.  Who's the one?  Was that her?  Oh, that's...  I'm not going to say her name.  She looks like a chipmunk if a chipmunk came to life.  Yeah, a little bit.  Sorry.  I don't know.  It's all good.  I go home with my soul because I don't know her.  I'm not...  She's very nice.  She's very sweet.  Oh, who's the one on the left?  Yeah, tell her friend I said with us.  Who's the one on the left?  Right there, yeah.  Oh, what do we got here? 
[01:19:30]  Fucking tits.  Uh-oh.  You don't even know who that is?  No, I have no clue.  It must be one of her friends.  Yeah?  Invite her over to the pool party.  Yeah, this pool party's going on.  Travis, what do you got?  Nothing.  We're talking about Rob's mom.  You guys should ask Rob who he goes shopping with for clothes.  Oh, no.  Travis?  Troy?  No.  No, no.  I go shopping with my mom for clothes.  She has some good taste.  I remember doing that when I was a kid.  She's a kid, kind of.  Well, no.  At 21? 
[01:20:00]  More of a kid, yeah.  No, 21-year-olds are kids still these days.  They shouldn't be shopping with their moms anymore.  Because they're cuddled.  Cuddled.  Cuddled and all that shit.  And cuddled.  And probably cuddled.  You're right.  And they have to live home a little longer and all that.  And what is, what do you walk around the store and you're like, oh, does she suggest things?  Yeah, she suggests things.  And you're like, yeah.  No, she doesn't.  I'm like, oh, that's a good one, Mommy.  Did you say that?  Do you go, thank you, Mommy.  That was a good suggestion.  I do, yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Does she pick your underpants?  No, she doesn't.  I bet she does.  Do you come out of the dressing room and she goes, okay, turn around.  She does, yeah.  And she goes, she wants to see your ass in your jeans.  Oh, Jesus.  I wasn't even going to go right there.  She's making sure they fit, bro.  Yeah, they got to fit.  And why don't you look like your sister?  I don't know.  She got my mom's side of the jeans.  So your mom's kind of.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't.  That's my mom.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Your mom's a very attractive woman.  Look at that.  That's 46?  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Why?  What's the problem?  Nothing.  What?  There's no problem there.  Let's see a close-up.  She looks good.  She keeps herself in good shape.  Where's Pops?  Right there.  That's your dad?  Yeah.  Looks like some goofy guy I used to know.  Jesus Christ.  How old's your dad?  53.  Oh, shit.  He looks like some goofy guy I went to school with.  Probably is.  You guys are all short.  That's what I see in the family.  Oh, Jesus.  I'll tell you a little 5'7". 
[01:21:30]  Is your mom the tallest one in the family?  No, she's got like heels on me.  I will give you $100 right now if you can prove you're 5'7".  Are you kidding me?  I feel bad to say the same thing.  Are you fucking kidding me?  You trying to squeeze an extra inch in on me?  Travis got you beat by an inch and a half.  Really?  At least.  All right.  Oh, man.  You could have won $100.  You're 5'5 tops.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Top, bro.  It's all good.  That's all right, Tom.  Because, you know, the good Lord doesn't give us everything.  Because it looks like your dad's 5'4", and your mom's... 
[01:22:00]  Damn, you should get one of those TLC midget shows.  Your whole family.  You guys could be on a wedding cake.  You, your fucking short father and mother, and your porker sister.  Hey, he said it.  He said it.  Kind of a porker.  Why would you say that?  I mean, she is.  She'll grow out of it.  She's not a porker, by the way.  No, she wasn't.  She's got a little baby fat still.  You know, she could use probably a two- or three-year eating disorder. 
[01:22:30]  And then it'll shape her right.  And then it'll balance everything out.  A lot of girls that age can get right through those eating disorders.  If they stick into the 20s, then there's a problem.  But as a teen, nothing better for a girl than a good eating disorder.  So why'd your mom bake for us?  She likes us, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Does she, you know...  Oh.  Like us?  Oh, Jesus.  No.  She doesn't like you that way.  Yeah.  She has listened a couple times.  Is she down?  She's not into older men.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:23:00]  I'm blown away I could have a kid in...  In their 20s.  In turning.  For some reason, I didn't do the math before today.  Before today, I'm like, oh yeah, oh, that's right.  This could be my kid.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could...  If things happened, you could have a grandkid that's as old as your kid.  I know.  You're kind of right.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  That is fucked up. 
[01:23:30]  That's fucked up.  That's pretty fucked up.  Real fucked up.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Yep.  You're young and caught into the wing, though.  I always have that fear that some old fucking kid comes walking through that door someday.  Like Sandusky's victims.  Hi, Dad.  Remember that time in Geneseo?  Well...  Oh, boy.  I was the result of that.  I finally got the information out of Mom, and she said... 
[01:24:00]  Oh, God.  I would just fucking...  I'd have to just shoot him.  Oh, my God.  And it looks like you, but...  Oh, God.  But you couldn't raise the kid in your way, so now he's just some shitty kid that looks like you.  Oh, God.  I know kids can turn off shitty when you raise them yourself.  I get that, but...  But when you have no control, and all of a sudden they walk through that door, and it looks like you...  Oh, my God.  I'd have to deal with, like...  Oh, my God.  Like somebody in my house. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  Like, I'm living here, Dad.  Right.  It's a sitcom.  Well, it's a sitcom, all right.  Oh, my God.  Fuck that noise.  I have nowhere else to go.  That was my girlfriend, Dad.  Right.  That'd be so great.  Fucking your son's girlfriend.  What are you taking?  Fuck him.  Get him out of here.  Go back to Mom.  Would you take in your own kid from something that happened way in the past?  But I want a strange man in my house. 
[01:25:00]  That's really what it amounts to.  If you don't know any of the kid from a hole in the wall, never knew you had a kid, and they come to the door,  I don't have these instincts where it's like, oh, let me nurture and feel good.  It's another man in my house.  Get the fuck out.  And you know the mom told the story a little differently.  Yeah, we were in love.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, hope he decided he had to go do radio.  I just didn't have the heart to tell him.  Could you imagine that?  You know, we kept in touch for the first few years, but I never told him about you. 
[01:25:30]  It was a whirlwind romance.  Right.  It was my first summer of real love.  Meanwhile, it's like, yeah, I threw a batch in your mom.  Doesn't entitle you to have any fucking rooms in this house, motherfucker.  She's romanticizing it.  Yeah.  We were in love.  It was a summer romance.  You know, I lived up here in Rochester, and he was a Long Island guy.  I'll always remember it.  Here, look at my scrapbook I made.  Right.  And there's one picture of me in the distance that she just happened to see in some fucking... 
[01:26:00]  And there's your dad.  Right.  There's your father.  No connected whatsoever.  Not one picture of us together.  Zoits.  As a couple.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  This is the only picture I got of him.  He'd come to the door.  The first thing I would say is, Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Fuck that noise.  You know, but this scenario has happened to people. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  Where all of a sudden they're living their lives, and all of a sudden a kid shows up going,  yeah, I'm your son.  And if he's fucking in his 20s, you literally have a man.  Right.  Now your life has to fucking involve some man?  Fuck that.  It would be wacky.  What?  What it?  Hey, Dad, I'm here at the door.  Whoa.  Shotgun blast. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Fucking gunfire.  Hey, Dad, I'm in the same business as you.  I heard about what you were doing for a career.  Oh, you do radio?  No, sheet metal work.  Oh, great.  You're a piece of shit.  You wouldn't like to invite him in for a beer?  No.  Why would I even do that?  You would have to.  You would have to invite him in for a beer.  Look, you'd do some big, dumb fucking afro and be all stupid.  Stupid.  Like me. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Stupid as shit.  Oh, that would suck, man.  Remember the time at NAW that woman swore you were her father?  Oh, yeah.  She was a crazy girl.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We should explain to people.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not even close to true, but she truly believed that he was her father.  We never did that bit justice.  It was a real scenario.  We just never...  I just used to yell at her to shut up and kill yourself.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That was crazy.  Like a taker. 
[01:28:00]  That's a crazy shit.  God, that would suck.  Anyway, big good.  I'd have to come up with, like, cash all the time.  Like, yeah.  Dad?  What if he had, like, a band and, like, you started singing in the band?  Oh, God.  Like that embarrassing commercial where the grandfather comes in and plays guitar with  his granddaughter's band?  Have you seen that one?  No, I really haven't.  It is so fucking embarrassing.  And he's rocking with her.  At one point, they're back to back.  He's like, let me show you how to do that.  This is how we did it in my day. 
[01:28:30]  And he starts playing, I think it's Born to Be Wild or something.  Is it?  Of course.  Born to Be Mild.  And he's fucking, like, jamming out.  And it's a chick band.  You know, the drummer and everything.  They're all chicks.  And they're looking at him like, look at Grandpa.  He's got...  Is this it?  Yeah, yeah.  Is this it?  Blue Cross?  Honey, how can I call now?  I can barely hear a thing with Amber's band practicing.  Amber's band.  Full screen.  You're already that enough.  But I know exactly what to do.  You take care of the music and I'll switch just the anthem.  Sometimes you just have to pull the plug. 
[01:29:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, God.  Sorry, Grandpa.  We'll try to keep it down.  Oh, man.  Is she fucking hot.  She was made for you, Ann.  I'd be fucking the granddaughter.  She was made for you.  Oh, man.  Look how bad this is.  Oh, fuck.  And he's making guitar faces.  And fucking Gabby Douglas is on the drums.  All races are represented equally.  Holy fuck.  You mean an old guy actually knows how to play Born to Be Wild? 
[01:29:30]  That's crazy.  And look at Grandma's dad.  He's rocking at his granddaughter.  Oh, fuck that.  I bet their grandfather took guitar lessons because of this commercial.  Oh, God.  You know, it's probably a good way to have a good relationship with my granddaughter.  Yeah.  She finds his posty vac in the bedroom, pumping up his dick.  So you wouldn't do that with your son?  He's like practicing in your basement.  You're like, you know what?  That's terrible.  I know a few tunes.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Great.  That commercial's fucking bad.  But that granddaughter, I never noticed how fucking completely smoking she is.  Yeah, God made that for you.  The grandmother dancing is the best.  You go get that.  The grandmother dancing in the back.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  You fucking bitch.  You fucking cunt.  She looks like that broad.  He's hot.  That was married to a Brady.  Like a younger version of that broad.  Really?  Married to the Brady guy.  Oh, good.  We're sorry, Grandpa.  She's calling him Grandpa, and then he's rocking out with her.  I don't know her name.  Adrian Curry.  Yeah, she. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  They were doing the backwards grind on each other.  They were rubbing their asses.  Weird.  Yeah, they were rubbing asses.  I'll take care of it.  You thought he was going to go in there and go, turn that shit off.  But he started rocking.  Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.  I'm getting beat up for my chipmunk thing, because I said if a chipmunk came alive.  Oh, oh.  I'm sort of going with an animated chipmunk, and then the chipmunk becomes human.  Oh, okay.  They have to pick up on everything. 
[01:31:00]  Every little thing.  Every little thing.  Oh, my gosh.  So what kind of baked goods from your mom that might be around our age?  Possibly.  Possibly.  Well, we got just the regular chocolate chip cookies.  And these coconut cookie bars.  Oh, boy.  Are you from one of those perfect families?  No, not at all.  There's a doily in there.  Yeah, that's pretty fucking.  He is a little bit.  You got one of those, like, fucking families, right?  I bet he's well-to-do.  Where everyone's good.  I bet they're well-to-do.  And everyone gets along, and there's no real drama. 
[01:31:30]  He's from a very affluent suburb in New Jersey.  So you got money.  And he was on the phone with his mom the other day telling her what sandwich he'd like for  her to pick him up for when he gets home.  Oh, my God.  And the dressing and everything.  You're part of one of those families.  Yeah.  Fucking hated you guys growing up.  I didn't have my sandwich for me for now.  Oh, God.  I was like, oh, and I'd also like, and could they do a pickle on the side?  Oh, thanks, Mom.  I did not say anything, dear. 
[01:32:00]  It's pure jealousy for me, by the way.  You know, I always dreamed that I would have a family like yours.  Dijon mustard or just regular?  Did he say that?  Oh, I want to, yeah.  I did not say that.  She gets your sandwich?  Yeah, she does.  You weren't on the phone with her ordering a sandwich so she could pick it up for you?  Why can't you get your own sandwich on the way home?  And it's a good, because I don't go that way.  And she was in the area, so it's like, hey, why not?  Entitled.  Yeah, yeah.  He's entitled.  It's impossible to find a sandwich in New York.  Guess what?  You're looking at guys slightly older than yourself. 
[01:32:30]  And when we were growing up, we would go out of our way to get our own.  Get our own sandwiches.  I do normally, but I do, too.  Oh, man.  Hey, look out.  He gets his own sandwich.  Wow.  Sometimes.  Whoa.  He puts that on his resume.  Yeah, yeah.  Get my own sandwich.  Able to get my own sandwich when forced to.  Yes.  Are you one of those trophy kids?  No.  Not at all.  Meaning you got a trophy for just competing?  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  It was only first and second place.  We always did. 
[01:33:00]  What place did you get?  Usually not first or second.  A loser.  Shame.  Well, he's short.  He can't play sports.  Plus, he's got no toes.  Maybe soccer.  They're all webbed together.  That's about it.  Of course you play golf.  He does.  And your dad plays golf, right?  Yeah.  Country club guy.  Yeah.  He invited me out to Jersey and said, if you want to play golf.  I'm so disgusted.  I caddied, though.  This was my dream growing up to have a normal family.  Hey, Dad.  Can I join you at the country club today?  Hey, Dad.  I don't have sailing lessons today. 
[01:33:30]  Can I, uh, you know.  Get your carton of cigarettes for Christmas again.  Go through this again.  Dad.  Yes, son.  Smoke up, Johnny.  Right.  You know, Dad, I don't leave for Europe for another week or two for the summer.  So maybe me and you could play a little golf before I leave.  Taking a hiking tour through France and Germany.  Those kids.  Oh, those fucks.  You had those growing up, right?  Oh, all the time.  What are you doing this summer, Greg?  Well, I'll probably be hiking. 
[01:34:00]  See, Rockefeller Center.  Yes, that is where he works.  I'll probably be caddying, is what I meant to say.  I got distracted by them, too.  Oh, man.  Where do you summer?  Where?  Yeah.  I summer at home.  I work.  I've been working since I was 13.  And Dad's business?  You're one of those kids where Dad has all the money.  But let him learn some life lessons.  He's got to learn responsibility.  Even though his bank account is already fucking solid.  Oh, but I need a car.  Well, we're willing to give you a loan. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, okay.  You're going to have to work it off.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  His mom buys his clothes, too.  She pays for him.  You do realize you're going to have to work it off.  You're going to have to take out the garbage for the next couple of weeks.  Once every two years, she...  That's not true.  Well, I mean, she picks him out.  She might as well pay for him, right?  What's your job?  I caddied since I was 13.  And then I worked at GameStop.  Caddying's good money.  Then GameStop?  Yeah.  Yeah, but when you caddied, could you get people into the golf course for free?  Could you be like, yeah, I'll hook you up?  No.  He offered to hook me up at a golf course.  Jesus. 
[01:35:00]  I didn't even play golf.  I'm not going.  We were allowed to play on Mondays.  Oh.  Yeah.  That was nice of them.  Did you ever win a caddy tournament?  Mondays.  The day they water everything and they refuse to turn anything off.  That's how we were treated.  No, you're allowed to play on Mondays.  Don't step on the sprinkler heads.  No.  Do not do that.  We will fire you.  So you would play basically in the rain.  Jesus.  Thank you.  Nice.  Then your ball would get on the green.  And because there's so much water on the green, you can't even putt properly. 
[01:35:30]  It was just horrible.  So what are you gunning for in this whole thing?  What are you looking to get into?  Definitely radio.  Oh.  Or television.  Oh.  You know.  Yeah.  I'm not entirely sure yet.  Still got a TV.  Can I ask you a question?  What does your dad do for a living?  He is in the insurance business.  Well, enjoy the insurance business.  Enjoy the insurance business.  Damn, that's cold.  Oh, is that cold? 
[01:36:00]  I used to be, believe it or not, very positive when these kids were coming up.  I can't be positive anymore.  This business is in a tough spot.  It really is.  Yeah.  Just learn this.  Learn this.  I think it's time we reevaluate your policy.  It's been a while since we've spoken.  You're going to be saying that a lot.  You know.  Yeah.  Things like that.  What about some kind of, yeah, full life?  Something like that, right?  What are you doing? 
[01:36:30]  You know, we need an umbrella policy.  If you put your auto under with us also, I could give you a great discount.  That's going to be you.  I hope so.  Yeah, this is a horrible business.  This is just fun for you.  Yeah.  You're not going to end up doing this.  It's not good.  Your parents were not good.  Your parents wouldn't let you, and they'd be right to not let you.  Yeah.  Whole life.  That's it.  Whole life policies.  Oh, gosh.  This is just killing time.  It's awful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your life was set for you when you were born.  You're all good. 
[01:37:00]  Good for you.  Good for you.  Let's try the baked goods.  What do you got there?  I got this coconut one.  Oh, that's good.  Coconut?  Oh, I hate coconuts.  I don't want to interrupt the flow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the fire marshal, or whoever that is, the Rockefeller guy, keeps bothering E-Rock.  So E-Rock keeps bothering me in my ear, because they want to test the fire thing that's in the studio while the show's on.  It's never going to break.  They want to come in, because we're the last smoke detector.  So they've got to come in and check it, and we're holding them up. 
[01:37:30]  Kenny's smiling.  Kenny's loving this.  How'd the guy come in?  I don't know.  Come in.  All right, come on in.  Come in and check it out.  There you go.  Sure, just check it out.  Yes, sir.  So what do you got to do?  Who are you?  Carol.  Hi, Carol.  Carol, nice to meet you.  That is actually a heat detector.  Indeed.  Yeah, it's not even a smoke detector.  I hope that's a heat detector. 
[01:38:00]  And we're going to take a little jumper wire to see if it goes off.  Don't get electrocuted.  We're just shorting it out.  Yeah, a little short circuit.  Now she's going to call.  What are you calling?  Are you calling the fucking fire detector?  It's crazy.  What are you doing with the phone?  My partner's at the panel.  Hey, partner.  I think we should upgrade your phone. 
[01:38:30]  I know.  Yeah, that is an old phone.  What are you doing with the old phone?  Galaxy S3, baby.  Oh, you didn't have it.  Let me take a look at that.  That's just the phone she's got to work with.  Oh, shit.  She just faced me.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the phone she just called.  Wait, wait.  Do you like the Galaxy?  I love it.  For real?  We were just talking about it yesterday.  Yeah, I think I might get one.  I love the Galaxy.  What do you like about it?  Real fast.  Then we'll let you go.  Travis doesn't like it.  FaceTime.  FaceTime.  The motion detector when you look at it.  If you look away, the screen would go off knowing that you're not looking at it. 
[01:39:00]  But if you're looking at it, it stays on.  It doesn't fade out on you.  That's a pretty good feature.  That's very clever, huh?  Yeah.  I know a little bit about a lot of things.  It's very clever.  Wow.  You got it with this job, you know?  Completely amazed he's telling me right now.  That's how clever I am today.  I'm so clever.  Take care.  All right.  See you later.  Thank you.  All right.  Keeping us from burning.  Yes.  Wow, you're a good actor.  Ask Miss Cleo what's going to happen with you guys.  That's what somebody's saying here.  Oh, that's funny.  Zippy doll, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  All right, can we try the cookies?  I told you it was fire marshal.  I want a chocolate chip.  I don't do that coconut shit.  No.  He's not a fire marshal from the goddamn fire department.  Well, he's not a police officer.  No, he's a security guard.  I hate it when you guys...  He's like the guy that's in charge, like Earl was in charge of the fire thing.  Hello.  Hello.  His mom even makes, like, perfect homemade cookies.  They're not, like...  What the fuck is this?  They're not even messy.  Look at these things.  Yeah, but they're probably not from scratch.  She probably punches them out with something.  They're from scratch. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, but she punches them out, doesn't she?  Yeah.  Yeah, chip-ahoys, really?  Shut up.  No, look.  You lose.  You lose.  These aren't the flat, crispy, fucking...  You lose.  This is way better than a chip-ahoy.  These are very good.  All right.  Thank you.  I like these.  Tell them what this is.  Well, my mom calls them a magic cookie bar.  Really?  Oh, boy.  Well, my mom's staring at a wall right now, wondering what the wall did to her.  Oh, man. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, that's brutal.  So take your perfect fucking life and get the fuck out of here.  And his mom makes the magic...  What are they?  Magic cookie bars.  Magic cookie bars.  And...  In contrast...  Oh, my God.  That is so bad.  Oh, delicious.  Oh, really?  She names her cookies.  That's wonderful.  She does.  My mom used to do that before she left.  Oh! 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  But she might still do it.  You just have no fucking idea.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  When she's making kugel.  Wow, this is really good.  I love a magic cookie.  Yeah.  I love a magic cookie.  She does how to bake and cook.  What?  She does how to cook and bake.  Of course she does.  Yeah, she's pretty good at that.  What does she do with her days?  She teaches.  What?  Eighth grade?  Seventh, eighth grade?  Yeah, you guys are like a kind of middle to almost upper middle class family, right? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  She knows some girls then, right?  These are awesome.  You should have one.  What are they?  The magic cookie.  You should really have one.  The magic cookie bars are good.  What's in the magic cookie bars?  It's like coconut, Hershey Kisses.  Oh, cigars and scotch.  That's not nice at all.  Travis's mom does not make chewy, chewy chocolate chip.  Chewy, chewy. 
[01:42:00]  You want to try one?  That's hilarious.  I wonder if magic latke bars taste the same.  Wow.  I'm not a big fan of coconut.  Good.  They're pretty good.  Fresh coconut salad, coconut soup.  Oh, I hate coconut.  You should have one.  Now I've got to go back to the ship and get another match.  What?  No, I don't want a magic.  You should have one.  It just adds texture, not flavor.  It's good.  Yeah, you've got to try the magic.  Stop it.  The magic.  What is it called again? 
[01:42:30]  Magic cookie bar?  It's a magic cookie bar.  No, I'll have another one of those.  Give me the little tray of a wonderful chunk.  Sam, I'm sorry, but this might be better than your mom's.  You always say that.  It's bullshit.  They're shaped nicely, too.  You even said how good it was, though.  Well, yeah, I said it's good.  I also said that a stale donut was good, but you were wrong about that, too.  It doesn't taste the same as a fresh out of the oven.  Wow.  That's good.  That's pretty goddamn good.  That's good.  Oh.  Mmm.  Yeah, I think he's, uh, we were going to goof on him, well, we did, about the cookies, 
[01:43:00]  but fuck.  Redemption.  You guys going to go to his pool party?  That's good.  You got a pool party?  Oh, I heard about this.  Yeah, I didn't hear an invitation.  You didn't invite that dude?  Invitations are going out next week.  Oh.  What kind of pool you got?  Uh, just like a, in, uh, in the ground.  Oh.  Nah, it's something special about it.  It's built in pool.  What is it?  No, nothing.  You got a diving board?  No, no diving board.  I got a basketball hoop.  You got a basketball hoop.  What about, um, now, I got to ask you this. 
[01:43:30]  Pool party.  Yeah.  Your sister going to be there, or is she bringing friends?  My 16-year-old sister?  Yeah.  No, she's not going to be there.  You say that like it's bad.  Why wouldn't your sister be at your house?  Yeah.  Invitin' her.  Because, um...  Be a good brother.  Yeah.  All right, I'll invite her.  You're a piece of shit.  What is it?  Is this going to be guys?  No, no, no, not at all.  Where are you getting the chicks from?  Does your mom still wear a bikini? 
[01:44:00]  No.  I haven't...  Could you ask her to?  She looks like she could pull off a bikini.  She does look like she could.  Definitely.  She's got one in the closet somewhere.  I hope she doesn't.  Yeah.  In the closet somewhere.  Would you like to see your mom in a bikini?  No.  Not at all.  I would.  I'm okay.  Why?  For the goof?  I'm still okay.  For a goof.  Even if it's for...  Sometimes you want to see stuff for goofs.  What a bit.  No.  Where are you getting the chicks from, then?  Yeah, where are the chicks coming from for this party?  Friends.  Bitches?  Bitches.  Better be some bitches. 
[01:44:30]  Some chicks.  More chicks.  Who says chicks?  That's so dumb.  Chicks.  Chicks.  Yeah, where are the chicks?  More importantly, you know how to get me coffee?  Yeah.  All right.  How about we do that?  The kitchen?  How about we do that?  Oh, wow.  Okay.  What?  You're going to send him out now on a mission?  No, I need coffee.  Oh.  No, we're going to break.  I should have explained that part, too.  This whole thing felt like a break.  I know.  I know. 
[01:45:00]  I know.  You just eat cookies and...  The cookies are amazing.  You're amazing.  Your family's amazing.  Everything about you is amazing.  Except for his toes.  Except for your toes.  All right.  It's understandable.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, that was fun.  Good job, bro.  Wow, those cookies are...  They're goddamn great.  Thank God Jimmy's not here today.  I'm just having one more.  I'm going to have one more.  And then he rationalized all the things.  I just had half a one of those and half a one of those.  I think it's good.  It doesn't even make a full one. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Look, give me one more.  I just want a taste of that one.  He's tortured when it comes to treats.  He is tortured.  He can't just enjoy it.  Yesterday, he was trying to justify having a taste of every donut.  Yes.  No, no, no, no.  In the end, it just ended up to one donut.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, give me another one, though.  Crazy.  Actually, it's more than one donut because...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we break?  Yeah, let's take a break.  Did we do the wings thing?  I guess we did, right?  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  I'm taking my headphones off.  Chicago, one week from today.  Yes.  Yeah, I can't wait for that.  That would be fun.  I really can't.  It sounds like people are going to show up.  Yeah.  I got a lot of tweets from people who are coming from out of town.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Kenny's coming in.  Kenny?  Oh, boy.  Chicago, what?  Oh, boy.  What's the matter, Kenny?  Well, we need to discuss the details of your police ride-along for Thursday night.  Whoa.  I'm so psyched.  I'm so psyched about this.  And also the Willis Tower tour that Roland set up for Friday morning. 
[01:46:30]  What are you talking about?  The glass box thing?  Yes, sir.  It's going down?  Yes, sir.  I can't wait for that.  All right.  Holy Toledo.  Yeah.  And the times are contingent upon if somebody's getting a Friday morning press or TV in Chicago.  I don't do TV.  I don't do TV.  You should.  It's good exposure.  Yeah, I know.  I don't care.  It's too late.  It's just too late for all that.  You think so?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:47:00]  What's going on with the ride-along?  Yeah.  It's going to be in one of the really good fucking neighborhoods I want it to be like.  Because I listen to that scanner.  I listen all the time to that goddamn Chicago police scanner.  You want to be disappointed, right?  And it is great.  Chicago PD are big fans of the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  They'll do the right thing.  Of course they will.  That'll be fun.  Yes.  I'll sign anything.  I don't care.  Sign any release.  It'll be fun. 
[01:47:30]  Well, covert.  Oh, okay.  Well, I went on a couple of ride-alongs here in New York.  They are fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  Cool.  And, you know, their commander is an ex-NYPD guy.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  Very good.  Foot pursuit.  What do we do?  I've been working out.  When you do a foot pursuit?  I'll do a foot pursuit.  I'll do a foot pursuit.  Yeah.  Shakedowns.  Do some shakedowns. 
[01:48:00]  Tune-ups.  A couple of tune-ups.  You just want to do some racial profiling.  That's all you want to do.  That would make your night, right?  Just some racial profiling.  Just some racial profiling.  I should just be the guy that points out criminals, because I can do it every time.  I'm really good.  Look, that guy right there, he's guilty of something.  I bet he's got something on him.  Yes, of being black.  No.  Oh, did I even mention that?  You know, Sam, you always got to bring race into it.  You're right. 
[01:48:30]  Sam.  I'm sorry.  You have a lot to learn, still.  God, Sam.  When you're not obsessing about Mark Zito.  I'm not obsessed with that, who will not be named.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Chicago will be a lot of fun.  When do we fly out?  Next Thursday?  Yes, Thursday afternoon.  Nice.  Going to fly out all nice, right?  Oh, you'll have lie-flat seats in first class.  We will?  No, you won't.  Wait, I'm going to be laying down all the way to Chicago? 
[01:49:00]  Yes, the staff is in first class.  Yes!  All right.  Strike that.  What?  The talent is in first class.  The staff is in no class.  Ah, you're no class.  Thank you.  What airline?  Oh, boy.  He doesn't want it.  He doesn't want a Beatles thing at the airport.  It's United.  United Airlines.  But he doesn't want, like, the airport to be out of control when we take off, you know,  pushing through the fans and stuff just to get to our flight.  If this doesn't go well.  He doesn't want to see that. 
[01:49:30]  What?  If this doesn't go well with United, Jimmy is going to be livid.  He had a little problem yesterday.  On United?  Yes.  Because he flew out to Chicago with Troy Kwan to go see Ozzy.  Yes.  And what happened with his flight?  They were delayed 90 minutes at the gate.  That means you're already on the plane, right?  Holy shit.  Yes.  That's the worst fucking feeling.  Yeah.  What happened?  Not that I'm stating something.  Some kind of mechanical problem.  Mechanical.  Great.  I don't know any further details.  Those ancient planes. 
[01:50:00]  I don't care if my flight's delayed if I'm still in the airport.  Yeah.  When you're in your seat, oh, is that enraging?  Because you start thinking, oh, my God, I would have been there by now.  I would have been there by now.  Right.  Their delay was as long as the flight time.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's the worst.  Yeah.  But thank God they fixed it.  So all's well that ends well.  Jimmy's probably interviewing Ozzy in the next couple hours, right?  This afternoon, yes.  Oh, he's probably so excited.  Yes.  He loves his Ozzy. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  He loves it.  Who else is he interviewing?  The rest of the guys?  I don't know.  Dress?  Something about a dress?  You're wearing a dress?  You bought a dress?  He's just doing the band.  His focus is on the band.  Troy Kwan has two backup recorders.  Of course.  He doesn't miss any spoken word.  Does Troy Kwan understand what he's in for?  I don't know.  Yesterday, he tweeted out what's going on in Chicago, meaning does anybody have anything  going on?  Right, because at this point, he won't see Jimmy until they're at the airport again. 
[01:51:00]  But that's not the way to handle a trip with Norton.  You don't go and find fun by yourself.  Is he prepared to do all that camera shit?  I don't think so.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  He's got to be the take the picture guy.  Not if he's looking for fun elsewhere last night.  I was one of the first take the picture guy, as far as the people around here.  Well, this is even worse.  In video camera.  I fucked up a few times.  It's very nerve-wracking.  And then Roland was take the picture guy for a while, E-Rock, and Sam.  Will you ever take the picture guy for Jimmy? 
[01:51:30]  Never.  I can't deal with that.  Oh, you are so lucky.  I can't deal with that responsibility.  No way.  It's so stressful.  No, it's easy, guys.  He'd be like that, and it's like, no, what did you do?  It's blurry.  I remember taking a picture at OzFest down in, where the fuck were we?  Was it, it was Philly?  And I think it was, it might have been Rob Zombie, even.  And there was a reflection in the window from a picture I took for him.  He toiled over that for months. 
[01:52:00]  He killed me for it, too.  And I'm like, well, I did the best I could.  And then, in the end, he was able to get the flash out of the window.  He needed the flash out of the window.  He photoshops it out.  He did not like that flash.  It was so subtle, too.  He will still bring that up, by the way.  That one he brings up?  Every now and then, he'll be like, oh, yeah.  I met Rob before.  I got a picture with him.  I mean, there was a flash behind this, but I got it photoshopped out.  He does, right?  Oh, yeah.  That was me who took that picture, and he let me have it.  He still is.  Subtly, like Jimmy does. 
[01:52:30]  It's very subtle.  Yeah.  You never know when he's angry.  Oh, never.  All right, we should break.  Jimmy's in Chicago for Black Sabbath and Lollapalooza, but he's not paying attention to Lollapalooza.  It's all about Black Sabbath, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Roland, you good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll talk to Roland next.  Oh, yeah.  You did something in a dress.  I don't know.  It was fucking hilarious.  It was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP, who was in love with you, was telling me that you did something in a dress. 
[01:53:00]  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage in a dress, or did you do something in public with a dress that was really completely uncalled for and hilarious?  I don't know.  But if it was, I'm sure it was us.  It was definitely gay.  I'm sure we pulled it off.  Of course.  You know, when you got guys that are weighing about 265, 250, 245, you know, with dresses that they're bursting out of.  No, we got to make sure the dresses are for, like, a 13-year-old pubescent girl.  Oh, you know what I mean?  So it's like, she doesn't even hit puberty yet, so, you know.  She said you went to a mall.  You were in a mall or something like that with a dress, and you had, like, your chain wallet. 
[01:53:30]  She said it was, like, the most ridiculous thing she ever seen in a mall.  That's where I was at.  Yeah, I was out in, I was in Boston, or we were hanging down in Philly or something like that.  But, yeah, it was definitely beyond gay.  It was a bunch of grown men, and we made sure, you know, we went to, like, a Victoria's Secret and just got the most insane.  No, well, you're just, you know, I can get you in the smallest stuff that, like, a 13-year-old will wear.  Oh, of course.  And you're just bursting out of these dresses and everything like that.  It was awesome.  You just gave him an idea.  No.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  I like the STP.  STP!  Ice car!  Ice car!  Hope you're enjoying your Friday morning, everybody.  Hi, everyone.  You're a mere half hour away from work.  Ha-ha!  That's for the 9 o'clockers.  Where are the 9 o'clockers?  Stuck in traffic somewhere?  That would suck.  Just constantly. 
[01:54:30]  You think a lot of people listen to us in their cars?  There's people right now listening.  You.  Yeah.  You right there.  Yeah.  I see you.  Get out of the left lane.  There's people behind you.  We're so isolated.  I don't even know.  I don't even know who listens to this anymore.  It's just a fucking way of life, isn't it?  There's always a way of knowing.  We don't even know.  We could be doing really well for this company, but God forbid they tell you that.  So they don't even, they keep all information.  I think we are.  I think we are, too.  I'm not stupid, but. 
[01:55:00]  Well.  Well, I'm stupid.  In some ways, certainly.  Thanks, man.  Thank you for pointing out the obvious.  Jimmy's not here for me to rag on.  Someone's got to be a target.  It's all good.  I'm fucking around.  I'm just fucking around.  Oh, man.  Old guys.  We have a commercial on this channel.  I don't even know who it was for, and I mean that.  But I heard a 68-year-old guy bragging that he could get boners again.  And I told Anthony, there's nothing sadder and worse than hearing an old guy brag about 
[01:55:30]  being able to get boners again.  Again is the key word there.  When you're a guy, you're just used to other guys talking about their boners from time to  time.  Boners.  But the problem I have is guys that, I guess, the boners went away, but now they're bragging  because they can get boners again.  Right.  Good for you, but I don't need to hear about it.  Their erectile dysfunction.  Like the guy with the Camaro driving down the street in the desert, and his car overheats, 
[01:56:00]  and for some reason, his ability to know how to keep his car cooled down ties in somehow  to him getting another boner again.  Right.  I don't know how.  Well, my favorite is when he finally gets a boner again, and him and his gal run out  in the rain.  So I have to assume that's jizz falling from the sky.  It could be.  It's either that, or it's just a dumb commercial. 
[01:56:30]  Why would they be running outside in the rain after he discovers he can get boners again?  And there's the other thing where all those commercials have the woman's in the kitchen,  and maybe she's making something a little, maybe pouring a little glass of wine, and then  the guy comes up, because now he can get boners, and he comes up behind her and puts his arms  around her and starts, like, nuzzling her neck, and she goes like, oh, and starts, like,  laughing, like, oh, I'm getting fucked.  Right.  Well, I think that's why women take up cooking, because they're done with the bedroom. 
[01:57:00]  Just done with it.  They're done, so they try to waste as much time in the kitchen.  Yeah, in the kitchen, not having to deal with that old fucking limp spaghetti dick.  That old guy gets boners again.  Uh-oh.  Because think about it.  The guy feels bad enough that he can't get the boners.  Right.  But think of the woman being like, I must, I can't give this guy a rod?  Yeah.  Like, it's just a real, it's a real fuck you to her, too.  Like, hey, by the way, you do nothing to this. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, by the way, I'm getting boners now, but that's not because of you.  Not because of you.  It's because of a pill.  Yeah, it's a pill that replaced what you used to do to me.  Some would say.  Others would say it's some kind of physical thing that happens when men get a little older.  Some would say.  I honestly think.  I don't have problems getting boners.  90%.  I'm good.  Boners are fucking.  I'm good. 
[01:58:00]  Boners in abundance.  I would honestly say, though, 90% of people that don't get boners.  Yeah.  This erectile dysfunction thing, it's because they just no longer have any physical attraction  to who they're with and aren't cheating or anything.  I honestly think they don't have any physical attraction to who they're with anymore.  But they don't get boners in general.  With all that visual stimulation out there, how could you not get a boner?  There's guys, though, that also, they can't look at porn.  They can't do, you know.  Why can't they look at porn?  They're fucking domineering, shithead fucking wives who just pounded it into them. 
[01:58:30]  Just beat them down.  Beat them down to the point where he doesn't get a boner anymore.  I don't even think twice about checking out a little porn here and there.  Yeah, well, you're in a much more relaxed atmosphere.  I think so.  Some girls, some women, see it as cheating.  Why?  What is he?  He was looking at pornography.  Wow.  Is that really happening?  I think so.  And I also...  I know it happens, but I mean, to a point where it's actually... 
[01:59:00]  I honestly, yes.  A real issue for a lot of men?  Mm-hmm.  Wow, that's got to suck.  And I also think that even if you look at porn, you're still not going to get a boner because  you just know you're in that situation with the woman you're not physically attracted to.  You're not getting boners.  You've kind of grown accustomed to not getting a rod because she just...  Why wouldn't you take the boner into the bathroom with you?  And jacket?  Yeah.  Because I think you're so beaten down and you're just... 
[01:59:30]  You're frustrated.  You probably know that the woman...  Really?  You're not going to get anything different.  I think that has a lot to do with these guys and their lack of boners.  You know, I'm not a doctor.  Just play one here on the radio.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Uh, you're being called a fag alongside me, sir.  Oh, right.  Brian in Ohio.  That gay song by the Thompson Twins Hold Me Now is on 80s on 8.  You fags.  No, I was the fag, I guess. 
[02:00:00]  Nice.  Don't lump Anthony into my fagdom.  I sold pictures.  Stay with me.  Me.  This is a nice song.  I got a picture.  I have a picture.  Pin to my wall.  Pin to my wall.  The 80s is all about doing this.  Duran Duran really did it.  He had to do a little of that Britney Spears with your voice.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:00:30]  Look at our lives now.  Hold time for the turn.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  We fuss and we fight and delight and the tears and we cry until dawn.  Oh, oh, oh.  Everybody.  White.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right, we got to.  All right, there we go.  We're about to do it all day.  Jesus.  Do it all day.  Depeche Mode, up or down? 
[02:01:00]  Don't like Depeche Mode.  All of their stuff.  Yep.  Nothing I like about them.  Too dark for you.  They're white people, right?  It was kind of like emo.  Oh, I thought you meant to.  It was kind of emo before emo.  Yeah.  I'm not really into it.  No?  Because they had the voice.  They did that voice you're talking about.  That's why I brought up Depeche Mode.  Duran Duran is one of the biggest whiny fucking fans ever.  And they're playing London, I guess.  Are they?  They're part of that Olympic shit.  They've just been huge forever.  Yeah, they never really went away, I guess. 
[02:01:30]  And I'm hungry like the wolf.  There's that voice again.  The 80s voice.  Yeah.  All right, old guys, boners again.  Fuck them.  There's something else I want to bring up.  Yeah?  Yeah, I forgot, though.  Oh, what's going on with Derek Jeter?  I guess he's having a sexual reassignment surgery.  You heard about this, right?  You know, that one really slipped by a lot of people. 
[02:02:00]  Yankees Facebook page hacked?  Yeah.  It says Jeter to undergo sex change operation.  Had to be a fucking Red Sox fan.  It was hacked early.  Well, no, it happened to a bunch of...  Here comes Travis.  I knew he'd come down the hall.  Travis knows this shit.  He's running.  Yeah.  We regret to inform you.  This was posting on the Facebook page yesterday for the Yankees.  To inform our fans that Derek Jeter will miss the rest of the season with sexual reassignment surgery.  He promises to come back stronger than ever in 2013 as Mini Mantlez. 
[02:02:30]  What?  Mantlez.  This is the best story of the day.  You like this story?  I loved it because whoever did this did it to, like, half the teams in baseball.  And they were all really funny.  Like, the Washington Nationals was like, moving back to Montreal.  See you, suckers.  And it's their official Facebook page.  And, like, everybody's like, what?  What are you talking about?  Sam, if you go to Dubspin, they have all of them.  I liked the Chicago Cubs.  The Cubs one was good.  The Padres one was good.  The Cubs one just said, fuck Bill Murray. 
[02:03:00]  No one bought into this, right?  I don't think they bought into thinking it was...  I think they probably figured it was hacked.  Yeah, definitely.  And you think everyone was in a panic?  Oh, my God.  We got to take care of this.  The Yankees one was definitely the best one.  You think?  I like to fuck Bill Murray.  Does it say that Derek Jeter is out for the season because he's having sexual reassignment surgery?  True.  Where are some of the other ones that are good?  Miami Marlins.  Oh, the Padres one made me howl. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, the Padres one's great.  Just a note.  Though the handicapped are allowed to enjoy Padres games at Petco Park, their attendance is strongly discouraged.  The White Sox.  Everyone knows President Obama is a diehard Chi Sox fan.  Unfortunately, we're voting for Romney.  Hashtag Muslim president.  Whoa.  Oh, boy.  Whoa, that's a little too...  Secret Service. 
[02:04:00]  Secret Service visit.  Yes.  Hey, what happened with the three blind mice guy, too?  Is that a real story?  Yes.  Was he actually kicked out of the game?  Yes.  Yes.  You can't kick the audio guy out of a game.  He did.  You want to see the video?  You heard about this minor league game?  Yeah.  When an ump blows a call, we've all pretty much have heard it.  It's one of those go-to things.  The audio guy plays three blind mice.  Well, this fucking ump got really pissed off, and he threw the kid out of the game.  What an asshole. 
[02:04:30]  I don't think he's allowed to do that.  I don't think so, either.  That's ridiculous.  Doesn't that have jurisdiction?  Jurisdiction.  Oh, he doesn't have jurisdiction.  He doesn't have jurisprudence.  Over the audio guy?  Oh, here's that band I was...  We saw sound checking.  I let you go home with the boy you're going to see.  You're going to get it, baby, don't you know?  I want to take it home, please.  You should never be lonely, lonely.  That's the night I've ever seen. 
[02:05:00]  Come on!  All-American summer is really petering out.  Today's Traveler's weather update is...  What?  And then they just go right to a commercial.  Why do you invite these bands if you do that to them?  We didn't fuck with that.  That's how...  No, they just went right to commercial.  That's Fox and Friends coverage.  That is hilarious.  Don't you think there's a lot of people down there?  I don't know.  There's probably less than there were.  I haven't looked at the window yet.  It's one of our joys every Friday to look out our office windows to see how lame Fox and 
[02:05:30]  Friends is on a Friday morning with these live bands.  When the camera's only showing the heads of the people in the first row?  Yeah.  Probably not a lot of people.  Not a lot.  Usually we see a lot of green.  Yeah.  Usually they want to showcase that.  Like, hey, look at all the people there.  That's the AstroTurf they put down, and you see a lot of green from above.  They have picnic tables.  What, Sam?  They have room for picnic tables.  Oh, I know.  That's how few people there are.  It's a lot of setup for about a dozen fans to come over.  One of them is Kevi.  Kevi goes down again? 
[02:06:00]  Uncle Kevi, yeah.  We send them down every Friday to just check out the bands.  Oh, really?  Should we bring them up here today?  That band?  Oh, please, no.  Ask them if they know any rock and roll.  I'll always listen to acoustic rock and roll.  So, uh, the Facebook page, any other good ones, Travis?  Um, I don't think so.  I mean, that's pretty much it.  And then the umpire really got rid of this guy?  Yeah, the umpire, he didn't like that the guy played three blind mice after an objectable  or an, uh, and a, I don't know. 
[02:06:30]  Was it a ball and strikes call?  Ow.  You okay?  Unquestionable is what I was looking for.  I feel a little behind today, too, man.  Just a little bit.  I feel like a little, uh, it's been a long week.  This has been a long week.  It has been, right?  Yeah.  A good week, though.  Yeah, it's just, it's just been a long week.  Like, my head, and then I feel like, ooh.  Like tracers?  A little trails?  That's how my brain feels today.  Just a little, ooh.  It's a fast show.  It's almost nine o'clock.  Ooh. 
[02:07:00]  Well, now it's going to be slow.  Well, thanks.  Come on, bro.  I don't look at the clock, so I can, you know, not look.  Oh.  So, thanks for that.  Yeah, but I mean.  A lot of days, Anthony goes, holy fuck, it's 9.30 already?  Yeah.  See?  So, you ruin it when it's 9.30.  Yeah, well, I hear 9.30.  I know.  You start thinking 10 ago?  I see that finish line.  And it's quarter, too.  It's not even actually nine.  I know.  You're going to look in, like, 15 minutes, and it will still be nine.  It'll only be nine.  Time will have stopped for 15 minutes, thanks to Travis.  I used to do that.  I worked at, like, a cold call, like, you know, survey place, and I would put, yeah, I would 
[02:07:30]  put a credit card over the part of the computer screen where the time was, because time just  didn't go there.  And I would trick myself into thinking, like, all right, it's definitely been, like, 30 minutes  It's the last time I looked, and it was, like, five minutes.  Oh, that's horrible.  It's the worst job ever.  Uh, three, so, do we have the video of the guy getting kicked out?  No, you know what?  There's no video.  I was mistaken.  I saw a video.  Did you?  Yeah.  I was just saying all that shit just for the radio show. 
[02:08:00]  I haven't seen the video.  I saw it all.  Okay.  I thought it was ridiculous.  Well, maybe Sam will find it.  But the announcer was hilarious, because he's like, oh, he's throwing Bobby out.  Oh, yeah.  And then, like.  They had fun with the whole thing.  Then fans had to just kind of, like, yell out, you know, what was going on, because.  Yeah.  If you can find the video, it is kind of funny.  Uh, Anthony, this fuck you is to you, sir.  What did I do?  Depeche Mode is the shit.  Shut up.  Violator is a great album.  That's from Charlie in Raleigh.  Shut up.  Never got into Depeche, huh?  Never. 
[02:08:30]  All right, here it is.  Oh, here it is.  Get it done.  Barber just got tossed.  Look, he's pointing at the audio guy.  What is.  He's kicked him out of the game.  Wow.  Never mind.  Derek Dye was just ejected from the game.  Derek.  Derek Dye was ejected from the game.  That is awesome.  That is absolutely awesome. 
[02:09:00]  Derek Dye was ejected from the game.  Put him in the box score, darling.  Wow.  That is so cool.  They love it.  Well, they know it's going to go viral.  What an asshole.  That is unbelievable.  Derek Dye, ladies and gentlemen.  What game is that?  Jesus.  Is it minor league ball?  Yeah.  Gotta be.  Like, probably.  Single A ball, probably.  Looks like the Cubs.  Yeah, Daytona Cubs. 
[02:09:30]  Daytona Cubs.  Very cool.  Have you seen the video of all the Olympians saying awesome during their interviews?  Oh, really?  Can we play that?  Is it a montage of awesomeness?  They like the word awesome?  Yeah.  Awesome.  It's all the U.S. people.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's a very U.S. thing to do.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  I'm sure the other athletes do it, but it's just a different language.  Yeah.  I know where it is, but I'm not going to help Sam.  What was it on, Deadspin?  Yep.  I mean, maybe.  Oh.  It's down a little bit, though.  I know Mant Les means Mickey Mantle. 
[02:10:00]  This guy's calling me dope.  I know that.  Oh, my God.  People are just stupid.  Mini Mant.  Mant Les.  But they wanted the Les part in there.  Right.  So I was trying to pronounce it properly.  You're done.  You're done.  And I'm taking five people out with you.  Wow.  Oh, fuck you.  Collateral damage.  Yeah, that's right.  That's what I do.  That's right.  All right, awesome.  Oh, we need volume. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, boy.  That was you.  I was just thinking about how awesome it was.  It was just awesome.  It's just an awesome experience, you know?  It's awesome.  It feels awesome.  It's awesome.  It's just awesome.  It was awesome.  How do you think the other young gals handled this?  Awesome.  She did awesome.  So awesome.  Those girls are awesome.  Oh, that's awesome.  So this is awesome.  Incredible.  Awesome job.  I remember, Trous, you said, I did awesome.  So how do you assess this one?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She was like, oh, my God. 
[02:11:00]  I was just thinking, oh, my God, oh, my God.  What are your thoughts?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Pretty good.  Oh, my God.  By the way, the broad from our beach volleyball team has horrendous tits.  Oh, yeah.  The flapjack one.  She's tall and blonde.  Yeah.  Legs for days.  Not good.  And then, whee.  Whee.  Whee.  Whee.  Whee.  That's not how you describe it. 
[02:11:30]  Terrible.  Yes.  Fucking, like those flapjacks, right?  What is that stuff from science class?  The mercury?  The mercury, yeah.  Like mercury on our chest.  Yeah, that broad's having a tough time keeping it all in there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  And then our missy broad has this horrendous mole that's driving me nuts.  Really?  I'm so sick of face moles.  Because, you know, I am sick of face moles.  Yeah.  And I'm sure I'm talking to people that have them right now. 
[02:12:00]  You know, you can get that shit taken off.  I had a few even.  In this day and age.  I had a few even.  That sounded really bad.  But I had some, and I got them.  I hated it.  I got them off.  Yeah.  It's a very easy procedure.  You don't have to walk through life like that anymore.  Yep.  Oh.  That's, uh...  Who is that?  We're looking at that, uh...  Wait, what are you looking for?  Missy.  Oh, Misty, I think.  Sorry.  Misty.  Misty from the, uh... 
[02:12:30]  Misty, uh...  Frank.  The U.S. volleyball team there.  Misty.  No, I'm sorry.  Misty, I believe.  Yeah, there you go.  She's the one on the left.  She's married to one of the L.A. Dodgers.  Oh, yeah?  That's an older picture of her.  Meh.  The problem with moles, they keep on growing throughout your life.  Yeah.  They don't go away.  Thus then, why Christian Bales is so out of control now.  No one ever noticed.  Back in the old days.  No.  American Psycho days, he didn't have it.  Yeah.  But boy, he has one now.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:13:00]  And he doesn't have to go through life like that.  Especially where his is.  It's between his nose and his right eye.  Just fucking get rid of it.  That's easy.  That is so easy to take care of.  Maybe he thinks it's sexy.  Maybe.  Maybe the women think it's sexy.  Maybe he's afraid of the doctor.  Yeah.  Ah, Violator.  See, they're just mad at you.  You got the Depeche Mode song against you.  Oh, Sam.  Want to hear one Depeche Mode song?  Play the one that would be the one I would have to go like, all right. 
[02:13:30]  And touch me.  Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.  How about this?  That's a good beat.  Personal Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not into this one.  Personal Jesus.  Your own personal Jesus.  No?  Nothing?  Nope.  Not this song.  What about anything else?  That's good. 
[02:14:00]  You know some shit should be going on when you hear music like this.  Yes.  This is it.  People.  People are people, so.  What?  People are people.  You like Depeche Mode Roland?  Depeche Mode 101.  What?  Depeche Mode CD 101.  What happened?  There's their CD called 101.  What's on 101?  All the classics.  Behind the wheel.  Wow.  You really like Depeche Mode.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:14:30]  You got to deal with Roland.  Roland knows every band.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Listen to this noise.  You don't like this?  Yeah.  You have your taste.  We all have our taste.  Yep.  I hear you.  Just can't get enough.  It's probably the one.  You know this one?  Yeah, I know this.  Doesn't mean I like it.  No?  No.  No.  No.  People so white should it be. 
[02:15:00]  You realize you can't have enough so hard for me.  Yeah, you know this one.  Which one's this?  This is probably one of their biggest hits.  They've had a few hits.  They've had a lot of hits.  Turn this up.  Turn it up, man.  How's this go?  You know this one.  No.  No. 
[02:15:30]  No.  I just can't get enough.  No.  I just can't get enough.  Is it the synthesizer that bothers you with the baby shit?  This is just a soundtrack to man-on-man ass sex.  In concert, they do real instruments, though.  It's really good.  Well, they're doing real instruments here, but they're kind of baggy instruments.  Well, the first few tours, it's all electronic, and they start bringing in the drums.  We thought it would be a good idea to just completely get the guitar out of music for about a decade.  Synth in there, yeah.  How do you just go, you know what? 
[02:16:00]  That guitar thing is overrated.  Overrated.  It's never been a guitar player.  I mean, they made it happen, but holy fuck.  They made a band.  And remember seeing, like, these videos, and it just looked weird because you would constantly be scanning the TV looking for the guitarist?  Yeah.  You always would look for the guitarist in there, right?  And instead, it would be a guy maybe holding a keyboard.  Where the fuck is the guitar player?  Like a guitar?  Yeah, it's got the...  It's just those wacky instruments you didn't even know the names of?  Keytar.  The keytar. 
[02:16:30]  Ah, right.  Enough.  Depeche mode.  Right already.  Yeah, I know Johnny Cash covered the personal Jesus song.  I do know that.  Fuck Marilyn Manson.  Let me hear Johnny Cash doing it.  For Roland, who's wearing a Johnny Cash t-shirt.  Oh.  I can finally fit into it.  All right.  Good man.  It's new as old.  I can listen to him all day.  I don't know why, man.  I know. 
[02:17:00]  Here's Johnny Cash doing personal Jesus.  I don't know why, too.  Johnny Cash that much.  Come on, man.  Johnny Cash.  Your own personal Jesus.  Someone to hear your prayers.  Someone who cares.  Your own personal Jesus. 
[02:17:30]  More quirkiness.  Jesus.  You don't like it?  No.  God, I love it.  Someone to hear your prayers.  I like Johnny Cash's, like, right before he dropped dead, covering everybody's shit.  Shit.  I liked his old, the old version of his voice like that.  Meaning, yeah, he was an old man.  Yeah.  I liked it a lot.  I liked his powerful fucking...  I love that, too.  I fell into a burning ring of fire.  Far that far.  All alone.  Just having all the confidence in the world.  Not just the bad night.  But as you...  I'm a believer. 
[02:18:00]  Your own personal Jesus.  Just fucking ready to drop dead.  Poor fuck.  Makes me feel bad.  That hurt video.  One of the most brutal things you could ever watch.  Him going to his old museum and everything's on the floor.  Holy shit.  Like, why did everybody was like, wow, this is so cool and stuff.  It's like, picture any other musician that you liked.  Right.  Getting all ancient and ready to drop dead and covering songs. 
[02:18:30]  Just be sad.  I like your impression.  Jesus.  I'm wondering if he heard this and went like, I want to maybe redo this song.  Or if somebody said, Johnny, here's what we're going to do.  How he's singing it, he's familiar with the song.  Now, as he's singing it.  But I'm sure someone goes, this would be a cool song to cover.  And he listened to the original. 
[02:19:00]  I'm sure he didn't really know the song before.  Yeah.  He decided to get into the project.  My guess, anyway.  I don't know.  But he's singing it the way the original kind of sounds.  Same type of rhythm to it.  Feeling unknown and you're all alone.  Flesh and bone by the telephone.  Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer.  I don't know what that means.  What is that?  I will deliver. 
[02:19:30]  You know I'm a forgiver.  That's an old fucking voice box.  Reach out and touch faith.  Face.  Oh, he's getting a spot bang on.  Reach out and touch faith.  Faith.  Faith.  Reach out and.  Reach out and touch faith. 
[02:20:00]  I always thought it was reach out and touch me.  Reach out and touch me.  And touch faith.  There you go.  All right.  A hundred million albums sold.  That's right, Danny and Bay Ridge.  A hundred million albums sold for Depeche Mode.  They're a massive band.  Doesn't mean you have to like them, though.  No.  I do understand.  It's got his taste, man.  It's very niche.  Kind of is niche.  I'm very fucking. 
[02:20:30]  You like a lot of the 70s rock bands.  I'm a laser.  What did you like from the 80s bands?  80s?  Yeah.  It was a rough time.  You like this one?  This was one of my favorites.  I'm going to pick this one.  Yeah.  Come on, everybody.  What did you like?  Duran Duran.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get to know your name.  Name.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  What the fuck?  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  All right.  What are we going to do?  Come on.  We know.  We know it's big, Scott.  I know.  You should have gotten right to the hook.  Hey, the anthem girl is responding to her terrible anthem. 
[02:21:30]  Remember?  The 11-year-old girl, she was singing in the national anthem, and she sucked the ace.  I'll just give you, like, the first, like, 20 seconds, 30 seconds.  Please do.  And please welcome 11-year-old singer-songwriter from Coppell, Texas, Harper Grusens, in the performance  of our national anthem.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  More?  What so proudly we hailed at the twilight?  She was terrible.  Well, she is responding to the criticism. 
[02:22:30]  That's very good.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  I blame America's Got Talent.  It was supposed to be her big break, and even this 11-year-old knew she blew it. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, it wasn't my best performance at all.  Yeah, it wasn't my best performance at all.  Oh, sure.  Before a nationally televised Major League Soccer game in a stadium packed with 22,000 fans,  well, just listen.  A perilous fight.  11-year-old Harper Grusens had been practicing for weeks.  For the ramparts we watch. 
[02:23:30]  She said she couldn't hear herself and was thrown off key by those annoying horns so popular  with soccer fans.  Yeah, the rocket's red glare.  I turned around and I was, like, starting to sing.  The Bum's Booth.  Wow, that's the wrong key I'm supposed to start in.  On YouTube, something...  You said that.  Wrong key.  You said that, because this song is what?  It's a very hard song to sing. 
[02:24:00]  Very hard.  People have said it over the years, huh?  Yeah.  So it's important to start in the right key.  You can't come back from that.  And it's very hard for an 11-year-old to have that kind of range that you can sing that song properly.  Yeah.  Because you've got to start so low in order to hit that higher note.  On YouTube, someone posted, my ears are bleeding.  The website Deadspin called it the worst national anthem rendition ever.  So bad it had to be heard to be believed.  I want to feel sorry for her, but I can't, someone commented. 
[02:24:30]  What I feel like doing and felt like doing was just to unplug her and just take her out, you know, of everything and just, you know, protect her.  The things that people were saying is really heartbreaking.  Harper can take comfort knowing she's not the first to have a star-spangled struggle.  One of her musical idols, Christina Aguilera, butchered the lyrics.  So proudly we was at the twilight's last gleaming.  And Roseanne Barr butchered a whole lot more than that. 
[02:25:00]  So this 11-year-old is undaunted.  Already practicing new songs and not giving up on that old patriotic one, she promises one day will be perfection.  There you go.  Ah, poor kid.  Yeah, 11 years old.  But she isn't that good.  I heard the version that she did that was supposed to be the better version, and it's very mediocre.  I was going to say, it's just all right, right?  It's just any, you know, kids, things like that. 
[02:25:30]  We got the Olympics on live right now.  Yeah.  Is there an actual event called the trampoline?  What?  What do they do?  Little flips?  You're kidding.  You can't have a gold medal in trampoline and be proud to take that one home from London, can you?  I was just jumping on a trampoline last weekend.  Yeah.  Well, I should be in the Olympics.  I should be in the Olympics.  I got pretty high up.  Olympic athlete?  I got 10, 12 feet off the ground.  I decided to see how high I could go.  Sounds like a gold medal to me.  And then all of a sudden, you hit the trampoline the wrong way, and your whole knee buckles. 
[02:26:00]  You're like, oh, fuck.  Oh, really?  Oh, man.  I've been on a trampoline in years.  You've got to land properly.  I don't plan on it either.  Huh?  It's kind of fun.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I had a good time with my nephews and nieces and bouncing my young son around.  My young son in the car.  He was kind of like sitting there.  Was he scared?  No, he was loving it.  I was bouncing him.  Yeah.  But then he kind of bounced on his head in a weird way.  I was like, okay, enough with this.  Yeah, you don't have to deal with that. 
[02:26:30]  That's stupid.  Oh, my God.  But men's trampoline qualification and finals.  So, wow.  You just jump around on a trampoline.  How do you qualify for a trampoline?  And how do you know when one of these guys is better than the other?  Yeah.  Look.  The top eight.  So, you see the X.  That is where he's going to want to be when he starts his exercise.  And he's going to want to stay as close to that as possible.  All right.  It's all about flips.  Very good so far. 
[02:27:00]  How do you know very good so far?  So, you see, these are the compulsory elements.  They're the easier ones.  I guess he's staying in the center.  You're allowed to do a couple of big ones in the exercise of your choosing.  These are the easier moves.  I mean, it's impressive.  Like that right there.  His final element.  See that knee buckle thing?  Yeah.  And you have to stop yourself?  Oh, man.  I don't know.  Now you're going to see that same thing over and over again.  And you can't tell which is better than the other. 
[02:27:30]  I hate events like that.  Yeah.  Because it comes down to some subtle thing where, oh, his fucking toe is a little wall.  He bent his leg.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know why I'm into the Olympics because I really pretty much.  Just bash every single event.  I don't get that.  And now it's the Russian guy.  I don't know.  Circus acts.  Yeah, what the fuck.  All right.  See, he's doing the same thing.  That's exactly what the fuck.  But similar to what we've seen from the Russian athletes,  what they do very well, and they're trained in this sport as well. 
[02:28:00]  I don't know.  They do get fucking high up, man.  It is impressive, but, you know.  And they've got to land on their feet after doing all those little flippy spinny things.  And I guess it's important to land on the X.  Why?  Because that's where you get the best bounce.  Because it could be all over the place.  Yeah.  You think you'd go flying off the trampoline?  Oh, man.  It just hit wrong.  Oh, and I'd be scared.  I'd yell like a fucking baby.  And there's this.  Oh, that little knee bend thing. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, it looks painful.  And look, you know, you're not going to get your feet caught in the springs like we did.  No.  Sam, growing up in the 80s, trampolines, they didn't have that protection over the springs.  And every once in a while, you would take a spring to the ball bag.  Ouch.  In the 80s?  Oh, yeah, man.  Now they figured out how to protect that shit.  They're real old to be trampolines.  Remember when you would take a spring?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking painful.  Did you do trampolines growing up?  I did trampolines.  I remember launching right off of them, too.  And we all knew.  Come off the sides. 
[02:29:00]  We all knew at least one kid that had a broken arm from a trampoline, because they also didn't  have the netting.  The netting around it.  Why couldn't they figure that out?  I couldn't figure out any of that shit.  Now you get a trampoline.  It's all pretty much enclosed.  The springs are covered.  My neighbor's got one of those.  They haven't used it in years.  Oh, really?  Like when I first moved in, he had kids the age, the way they would actually go on the trampoline.  And now the trampoline's just been sitting out there for fucking five years.  Nothing.  With nary a child bouncing on it.  What are the children doing now?  I don't know.  Probably fucking smoking. 
[02:29:30]  Smoking pot or something.  Drinking.  I don't know.  They're not the little tater tots that they were.  No, we took risks.  You had to worry about the springs.  And there was no netting to catch you if you went off when you went off a little bit.  Yeah.  Now you'd used to have somebody spot you.  And spotting on a trampoline amounts to if someone sees you kind of coming off, they're  supposed to throw their body at you.  Yeah, right.  What the fuck is that about?  I remember every once in a while you would launch yourself and you'd go off the side and you're 
[02:30:00]  like, oh fuck, I gotta hit the ground now?  Like I said, I'm on the ground.  From 10, 12 feet up?  I just threw myself off a building.  So.  Yeah.  No, I wouldn't fucking watch the Colonel's own trampoline.  They also have synchronized trampoline.  They do not.  Oh, do they?  There you go.  They do not.  Oh, hence the two trampolines next to each other.  Oh, now they gotta do the same exact things.  Those are the guys that, what, are scared of the water?  Yeah.  Well, maybe.  Because it's the same moves.  Maybe that's the black guys. 
[02:30:30]  Well, Black Olympics starting up.  I really liked your take on that.  That's very funny.  Black Olympics.  They even segregate the Olympics.  First week is white.  Second week is mostly black.  Swimming.  I think you're onto something with that.  Yeah.  Oh my God, they're up high.  Do they do the ghetto version of the national anthem for everybody?  Nah, I think they're very respectful.  Very respectful.  This guy's like landing on his stomach like you did when you were just goofing around. 
[02:31:00]  I know, but.  Some of the stuff's very impressive.  Can you make a living from doing the trampoline?  I, you know, I was going to go pro.  Pro trampoline-age.  Yeah, that just seems silly.  Look at him.  He's like, oh, why couldn't I do the fucking rings?  Why couldn't I be a hero if I did the rings or fucking the pommel horse?  Yeah, you don't get on the Wheaties box because you're.  The trampoline guy.  You're the trampoline guy.  You could win every gold medal in trampoline.  That's never been given out. 
[02:31:30]  You're just sitting by your phone.  It's got to ring soon.  I'm a gold medal winner.  I got 28 gold medals at this point.  Olympic gold medal winner.  What the?  What do you got to do?  Yeah.  No, sorry.  No, sorry.  The silver medalist in gymnastics will sooner get.  The bronze medal winner in gymnastics will sooner get than a gold medal winner in the trampoline.  You think these guys, you know, they go to the Olympic Village with their gold medals  and the girl's like, oh, wow.  What do you win the gold in?  Hey, what is?  The trampoline.  The trampoline.  Where are you going? 
[02:32:00]  As she's walking away, he's like, it's very difficult, you know.  It's like trying to explain it to her as she's walking away.  You know, I practiced just as hard and as long as they did.  You know, in that world, it's the same shit every fucking guy has to deal with.  Right.  It's not good enough for certain women.  Not good enough.  But it's a gold medal.  Yeah, but it's in the trampoline.  Trampoline.  I'm going to go see if Michael Phelps is around.  And she's like.  Or Lochte.  That's a competition?  Right.  Yeah.  No, really. 
[02:32:30]  You should have seen.  That's embarrassing.  You got your gold medal from bad bitches and bitches.  Badmanenton.  Badmanenton.  Badmanenton.  They're waiting for their scores like anyone cares.  Let's see what the scores are for something they'll look like.  How about the announcers?  They've got to be like, ugh, we're announcing trampolining.  Difficulty execution.  Flight time.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  This sport doesn't even have an announcer.  That was where the announcer was supposed to come in. 
[02:33:00]  I'll say something.  They don't have the announcer.  See?  Even the Olympics know.  Oh, that's bad.  The guy's sitting there waiting for his scores in every other event.  That's where you know the announcer.  The announcer's like, oh, he did a great job on that one waiting for the scores to come in.  And then he just sat there and he saw his own scores and he got up and walked back to wherever the fuck they walked to.  Yeah, that's sad.  Yeah, I think some of these gold medals aren't worth as much as other gold medals in the Olympics. 
[02:33:30]  You're looking upon it or sell it?  Well, it is an Olympic gold medal, but it is in trampolining.  If this was maybe, you know, Gabby's gold medal in gymnastics, we'd be talking a lot of money here.  But trampolining, I've got to frame it.  I've got to keep it in my shop.  I've got to throw it in the garbage.  What are the Mac Daddies of gold medals in the Olympics?  It ain't going to happen, son.  That's funny, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Well, it's a gold medal, but it's a trampoline one, son.  I can't give you nothing for it.  The old man.  What's the Mac Daddy medals?  Mac Daddy medals.  Pretty much any gymnastics medal.  Yeah, gymnastics.  The other side of it is like a ribbon medal for those ribbony fucking people.  That don't mean shit.  It stinks.  That's nothing.  Swimming is huge because, I mean, even back in the day.  Although not all swimming.  Mark spits.  But they have too many events.  The butterfly is huge for some reason.  There you go.  People love that butterfly. 
[02:34:30]  Eh, yeah.  And then a few of the diving.  Overall diver, maybe.  Sacredized diving, no.  No, no.  Overall diving, yeah, that's kind of big.  Badminton.  No, badminton.  Badminton.  And then your track and field stuff, you know?  Yeah, the sprinters, especially.  Your sprinters, your hurdlers.  The sprinters are big.  Your triathlon.  Decathlon.  Oh, that one.  But when we were growing up, the decathlon was huge.  Is it still huge?  I don't know.  That was like, that might have been the number one event when we were growing up. 
[02:35:00]  That's the one that, what's his face he won?  The Jenner guy.  Bruce Jenner.  Yeah, there was a few over the years, right?  He won that one.  He's got just spinning around in slow motion.  He's got a weird trampoline outfit on.  Oh, God.  With thingies that he puts around his heels to keep his pants on.  Athletes don't have a say.  Look at this.  Oh, God.  I don't know, man.  Some of this stuff is just nonsense.  Looks like he's wearing Mork's outfit.  Right. 
[02:35:30]  Terrible.  Look at the coach.  They're all anxious.  Waiting for their scores.  High fives.  All right, good job.  Here it is.  The trampoline coach.  Go prepare for the second round.  Worse than even being trampoline guy.  Trampoline coach.  Yeah, I don't know.  Just bounce.  Keep bouncing.  That's his instruction?  Yeah.  You're going to want to bounce.  Thanks, coach.  Here's another one.  What's happened to him since, Elby?  Well, he actually suffered a broken leg back in 2010,  and it took him out of the sport for six months. 
[02:36:00]  So he lost some valuable training time.  But Jason says he's ready for this competition.  He's been known as a daredevil around the world,  performing some of the highest degree of difficulty in this sport.  Never heard of him.  You won't see that in this routine, though,  because, as we said, this is the prescribed routine.  Oh, boy.  Able to add a couple of that.  A lot of gay-sounding announcers in the Olympics, right?  In the later round, he will go crazy.  Crazy?  His goal here, just to be clean. 
[02:36:30]  And he was.  Very clean.  I don't know what I just saw.  They're applauding.  But I don't know what I just saw.  And look, he's all smug, like,  yeah, I trampolined the shit out of that.  I fucking killed that.  I got my trampoline on.  Look, he's got an attitude.  He's got an attitude.  And I did it.  Fuck these other gold medalists.  That's the score.  So Fedorenko, who was the first man on trampoline,  still has the score to beat.  Top eight, go to the final.  Sitting with his coach going,  yeah, I fucking stuck that shit. 
[02:37:00]  I fucking did it, man.  Did you see me go up and then down?  And I did a spinny thing one time.  And a spinny thing.  I sat on my ass, bounced back up.  I don't like his attitude.  He does have a fucking attitude.  Like, he's a goddamn Olympic swimmer.  You just can't.  Look at this guy.  He's got a fucking little belly on him.  Oh, my God.  I guess it's not important to be in shape.  It helps with the mass.  Getting it moving.  Gets a little momentum.  Why are their pants so high? 
[02:37:30]  The whole thing is dumb.  See, because it's fake pants.  Because that's a one-piece.  It's a onesie.  So you've got to go with,  if you're going with the onesie,  go with the, you know, one color.  No, he wants it to look like a shirt and pants,  but it looks like his pants are up too high.  Yeah.  Yeah, because you can't have your shirt popping out.  Let's look at this dork.  Tell me what is different about this one and the last guy.  World Championships, Europeans.  Jumping about the same height.  And now he flipped over.  He hit his belly. 
[02:38:00]  The other guy did that.  Now he's on his feet.  He goes the other way.  All right.  And he flips over.  Just off the bat, just from appearance,  it looks like he is getting nowhere near the height on his skills  that we have just seen.  Who's talking about?  Burnett from Canada.  Well, he's not getting that height.  Ow.  I've got a spike.  This is painful.  This is terrible.  Is that the dismount?  Why don't they allow them to bounce slowly down to the ground? 
[02:38:30]  They have to stop themselves like it's a dismount from the trampoline.  Yeah.  Oh.  We're going to break it.  There we go.  Yeah.  Why are you saying yes, Sam?  We've got to do a read.  What read?  Oh, we've got to read things like...  Well, you have a read read.  Right.  And then you also have to record some stuff for Chicago.  Yeah, we should talk about Chicago next.  I want to know if the people are excited about Chicago.  Chicago!  Week from today, we'll be broadcasting live in Chicago. 
[02:39:00]  I can't wait.  Where is it at again?  Marionette Park at the thing?  115 Bourbon Street.  I don't have that in front of me.  115 Bourbon Street, right.  When are we broadcasting?  When should people show up, Sam?  The doors open at 2 p.m. Chicago time.  Okay.  You guys go on at 3.  Okay.  We're doing...  Some people got to dress up like Chip,  so we can do Chip off the old block,  and do your impressions.  Yes.  Definitely do better than Sal did yesterday.  Yes.  Oddest thing you own?  I hope people really bring weird shit.  Well, there's prizes, too. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, it's $1,000.  You can make a quick grand, man.  Also, we have $1,000 for the pig race.  And, you know, that's an old bit.  That's...  People, the older listeners will remember,  that's where we got the freeze-dried monkey from,  because we were doing kind of oddest things out.  Right.  Freeze-dried monkey.  And then a guy put his stick in...  Well...  Stick in his mouth.  Well, it happened, so what the fuck.  Yeah.  And then that was the same broadcast  where a girl had some stranger babysit her kid  so she could blow a guy in the parking lot.  That's dedication to the blowjob.  Really.  That's why you got to come to these live broadcasts. 
[02:40:00]  Think about it.  They're just ridiculously fun.  Remember her?  Yeah.  I had someone to watch my kid.  The kid was...  Oh, yeah.  I don't know, maybe four months old,  six months old.  A little stroller.  Because she saw someone she liked, man.  Yep.  And she had to have that dick.  And then we're also doing the pig race, don't forget.  I hope so.  Email obianthony at SiriusXM.com  because we're giving away $1,000 for the pig race.  That's a lot of money just to be a pig.  Yeah.  It certainly is. 
[02:40:30]  And you know what?  We'll be cool.  I mean, and you can wear a mask  so no one knows that you're the pig.  Right.  Yeah.  It's all in good fun.  Of course.  And then the worst breath contest.  It could either be you just have horrible breath always  or you can make your breath really bad.  And E-Rock's going to be the judge.  And that's $500.  And then there's, you know,  us pulling cash out of our pockets for dumb shit.  You know how late it would have been  if it was nine when Travis said it was nine?  I know.  Yeah, it would have been...  Fucking asshole.  It would have been 942.  Yeah.  Fucking asshole.  I'd be keeping track.  It wasn't nine. 
[02:41:00]  It would have been 942.  I need to know the answer.  I swear to God, too.  Because they just said that.  I'm like, that guy chipped us out in 15 minutes.  Oh, he really did.  Told us it was nine when it was 840 whatever  at the time, 45.  Yeah.  All right.  Now the trampoline guy's bouncing.  I don't know.  We'll write enough of it.  Oh, it's a Japanese guy now.  Oh, look at the hair.  I like when you lower your voice, though. 
[02:41:30]  I like the hair like a singer from White Snake.  Look good and easy to manage. 
[02:42:00]  I love when you soften it.  We have a straight black hair.  Yeah.  Want to make better, incorporate American, groovy American hairstyle that look like a rock  and roll.  And the hair always is straight and black.  But I like to put the color in hair, make it lighter, look much better when hair light. 
[02:42:30]  Then people mistake me for a California boy.  I can listen to that all day.  Why do they do that?  I don't know.  It's odd.  They like to emphasize the last part.  I really don't.  And it kind of sounds almost American, too.  It is.  The height.  Height.  Very good.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  E-Rock, you good today?  I'm fine.  All right.  How can you not be?  I'm just thinking we might have to, you know, use E-Rock to get us a 10 is what I'm thinking.  He dressed appropriately for it.  Oh.  Oh.  Wait.  And to the height.  Oh, no.  Hey.  Just watch a Japanese.  Go on the trampoline.  Trampoline.  Wear groovy trampoline clothes.  And when I come down, hair sticks straight up. 
[02:43:30]  Look very American.  Very American.  And I look very sexy to the girls.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the opinion of today's show.  As people that find some stuff funny that we, what am I trying to say? 
[02:44:00]  I just, putting the kid in the tree makes me laugh really hard.  And I know we're not supposed to laugh at that.  I know.  It's so twisted, obviously.  But the video of him in the tree.  I know.  Because he's being beat up.  It's horrible.  It's a case of bullying that was going on.  And obviously there's a bullying epidemic going on out there.  But the video of the kid.  I know.  They're just stuffing him in a tree. 
[02:44:30]  Because that shit happened to all of us.  Yeah.  But it wasn't bullying back then.  No, it was called, you know, you should have ran faster.  And obviously.  Run faster home.  I got to be careful.  Obviously what these kids did is, it's horrible.  It's horrible.  And it's wrong.  But the video of the kid.  They're trying to shove him in.  Why are they trying to shove him in the tree?  They also try to shove him into something else, too.  Like on top of a fence.  Trying to like hang him up on a fence.  And in the end, the kid wasn't really hurt.  Still horrible.  You know, obviously.  The tape. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, tape.  The fucking video I saw.  They didn't.  They weren't like kicking him.  It wasn't like they had him down on the ground.  And they were dragging him around by his feet on the ground.  But he was down there.  And I thought they were going to start kicking him in the head and shit.  And I didn't see any of that.  They lifted him up and tried to.  They fucked with him.  They fucked with him bad.  Put him in a tree.  Yeah.  Why are they blurring everybody out, man?  Because they're youths.  Yeah, but they were brave enough to do it and fucking film it for their friends.  So let's see your faces. 
[02:45:30]  Upper Darby.  That's where the Tower Theater is.  Upper Darby is.  Yeah, I know Upper Darby.  And look, now they're dragging him by his feet.  Yeah, but this part.  And then they pick him up.  And now they're trying to hang him on a fence.  This is actually news, though.  Some kids put another kid in a tree.  It's like.  Yeah, because look.  Look, this guy's angry.  We will not have this happen.  It will never.  Make your fellow students and make the streets unsafe.  It's unconscionable.  We're not going to tolerate it.  And they're going out in handcuffs. 
[02:46:00]  Authorities say they have arrested seven teenagers in connection with the assault.  White and black.  Six were arrested.  Nice.  They got together.  They got together for some bullying.  Working together for bullying.  It's about time we get together for something.  Yeah, that was nice to see.  Does the kid being stuffed in the tree make you laugh, even though you're not supposed  to laugh at that?  It's hysterical.  It is, right?  Yeah, because, you know, you've seen that before.  Oh, my God.  I saw that.  As kids being bullied, you see that.  They shoved me in a locker in high school.  All sorts of shit.  Stop. 
[02:46:30]  Got to turn that down.  It was part of growing up, wasn't it?  Yeah, being bullied.  Then again, part of growing up is when those kids show back up with a fucking trench coat.  Right.  And they fucking extract a pound of vengeance.  Sure.  But is it worse now than it was before teachers did anything and before the police did anything?  Right.  Yes.  And I'll tell you why.  Because Ellen DeGeneres is talking about it.  Oh, shit.  Makes it way worse.  Oh, shit.  Bullying.  Because back then, no one went to the fucking principal. 
[02:47:00]  When you got your ass handed to you outside the school or you were bullied or some shit,  like, everyone knew who the bully was.  You just didn't fuck with him.  And you walked past on eggshells hoping nothing was going to, you know, happen where he decided  you were the one, you were the fucking wounded gazelle by the watering hole.  That was what the bully did.  Who the fuck went to the principal?  That's like going to the warden in prison.  You didn't do that.  You just didn't do that.  You didn't do it.  That would make it way worse.  Now the police get involved in shit.  Although we never had the opportunity to put the fun stuff in front of the world to 
[02:47:30]  see on YouTube and shit.  Yeah, I don't know.  We just had to tell the stories.  We were like old school, like the Indians telling the story of when you beat the kid  up.  Yeah, I don't know.  Patanka.  I don't have I don't have kids that age, so I have no idea if it's worse.  I have no idea.  I mean, I would assume it might be a little a little more worse than when we were growing  up.  Is the result worse is what I'm talking about.  Like the bullying.  All right.  Everyone everyone had bullying events or bullied people or whatever it was. 
[02:48:00]  But did we turn into a more violent people than these people that are being bullied now  are turning into?  I don't know.  Like Jimmy was saying, he comes back with a, you know, trench coat mafia kind of a thing.  I really don't know.  Yeah.  This is out of our league because we don't have kids that age.  Oh, I know my sister.  And she's got a 12 and a 10 and she's she said it's a completely different world out  there for kids. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Completely.  But that's that's her take on it.  They are being raised softer and weaker.  So much softer.  And I think that plays into this.  Thank you.  It does.  But a part of it, like a lot of the like I mean, like real nasty bullying.  There's a lot of fucking 40 and 50 year old fucking cocksuckers out there.  And there's a lot of people out there that are fucked up because they were bullied that  are like fucking squeamish as adults.  And it's like beyond just normal competition.  But guys that were just tortured growing up.  I mean, it's a balance. 
[02:49:00]  You know, I can't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I wonder what the, you know, repercussions there are.  I don't know.  They are being raised like really fucking wimpy, wimpy, like kids don't go out anymore.  You don't see them like riding their bikes around fucking and just being out doing things.  That's a good point.  We were thrown out of the house as kids.  It's like, get out, do something, go.  You got home from school and you were in maybe for a quick snack, right?  And then you were gone for hours.  And then you were gone until at least dark. 
[02:49:30]  And your mother never knew where you were.  You didn't know where you went.  They just know you went out with friends.  I'm going out with my friends.  All right.  Whatever.  Remember when you did stay home, maybe because it was still in the middle of a snowstorm or  rain or whatever.  Yeah.  And it just felt weird.  It was weird.  It was odd.  That you were inside?  Yeah.  Inside.  And then we'd go traipsing around in the woods.  Oh, yeah.  It turns into like Lord of the Flies.  You're just fucking throwing rocks, building forts and throwing things, breaking shit.  Man, you're right.  You don't really see kids out anymore. 
[02:50:00]  Kids aren't out.  They're not out playing anymore.  As much.  Yeah.  We had neighborhoods where I grew up where it was like every weekend you couldn't even  like drive around.  The adults couldn't drive around because the streets were just kids with bicycles and fucking  you know, we'd play war and shit.  We'd get little guns and you'd run around the yards and playing and shit.  No one does that anymore.  They'd lock their kids up in the house to keep them fucking safe because there's animals  out there, I guess. 
[02:50:30]  I don't know.  Or the perception.  I think the news has scared the shit out of parents, too.  Because, I mean, there are horrid people out there doing horrid things.  But, again, is it any more than it was?  Nah, you're always going to lose a few to some kid touching.  Of course.  Just a few.  What are you going to do?  You've got to deal with the overall numbers.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to look at the percentages.  You can't save everybody.  Percentages.  You've got to sacrifice a few of the little fuckers.  I don't know.  What do kids do these days?  Video games.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:51:00]  Computers.  You don't go out.  And they all got phones.  Phones.  Go to the mall.  My 10-year-old needs to get a phone.  Could you imagine having a phone at 10?  How cool that would be?  I couldn't use the phone at 10 in the house.  Like that phone.  I had to, like...  Ask permission.  Don't tie up the line because there wasn't call waiting.  Yeah.  Don't tie it up.  And no long-distance calls.  Long-distance.  Who are you calling long-distance as a 10, 11-year-old?  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  Anyone still doing the prank call?  Or is it too easy to get caught?  Too easy to get caught.  Remember how much fun prank phone calls were as kids?  That was drugs.  For me, that was doing drugs on the weekend.  If you had, like, friends over and you just grabbed that phone and had the balls enough to start dialing and making prank phone calls, you would laugh your ass off.  And it was such a feeling of satisfaction, and it was just the greatest thing growing up. 
[02:52:00]  Did you buy into the fact when the guy on the other end said, I know where you live, and you were freaked out the rest of the day?  Sometimes they were freaked out, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, I don't know, maybe he just does.  I don't know.  There was no call waiting or anything, but he goes, I know where you live!  I don't know.  And the whole day, you're just in this paranoid state, like, does he?  Did he recognize my voice?  I think he might know.  Oh, fuck.  I remember pranking once, a bad call, and this was always the ballsiest thing you could ever do, is dialing zero and pranking the operator.  Because you would prank the operator, and then you'd hang up and pick up your phone, and for, like, five minutes, you wouldn't have a dial tone. 
[02:52:30]  Like, she'd pull the fucking plug on your phone.  Right, because they're trying to trace it.  And you'd start freaking out, like, they're tracing it, they're sending the cops.  You'd look out the window thinking the cops are going to come for a prank call.  That takes balls.  It was scary.  I don't know if I ever did that.  It was usually a friend that was fucking up.  It's like, you don't prank the operator, you asshole!  It was usually the friend that discovered pot first.  That's like whacking out a made man.  Look, can we just call the bowling alley?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did we have to call the operator, really? 
[02:53:00]  Bowling alley, ask him if we've got 10-pound balls.  Exactly.  And hang up.  It's fucking, we'll laugh our asses off and fucking...  It's a classic.  Eat a whole pack of Hubba Bubba.  It's fucking great.  I used to love...  Night is set.  I used to call, when I was in high school, we'd get stoned, and I used to call these, like, places where nuns were.  Where they were, um...  Where there was, like, this sisterhood or whatever it was.  A nunnery?  A convent?  Yeah, it was, like, a place that nuns...  Was it a convent?  I don't know.  A convent sentanko?  I just don't remember.  It was something that nuns ran or whatever, and I would always call and say that, like, you know, my older men were having sex with me, and... 
[02:53:30]  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, yeah, constantly.  Holy shit, what are you talking about?  Yeah, we would just giggle.  How come you have to turn...  We're always talking about this innocent little childhood thing that we would do.  Jimmy always has to take it away from...  You know, do you have Prince Albert in a can?  You better let him out.  Hardy har, hang up.  And you have to talk about calling nuns and telling them you had man dick in your ass.  Yeah, that was being sexually abused. 
[02:54:00]  I called a bomb...  I told you a bomb's threat into my high school.  Holy shit.  We were all stoned.  And I remember they said everybody had to leave the school and walk out.  Because I was convincing.  Wow.  That's Prince 1985.  I think the statute of limitations doesn't run out until tomorrow.  Yeah, let us.  Now you're in trouble.  I was stoned.  What are you going to do?  I was fucking high.  We were all laughing.  My friend's house.  I know.  You can't do it now.  I've been really high.  I've never called in a bomb threat anywhere. 
[02:54:30]  If you knew when I was even younger where I tried to call, I called the White House.  I was very young.  I was probably 12, 13.  And I forget how I got them.  I had the operator put me through or something from the public library.  Was it Reagan?  Who was it?  You were 12?  You know what?  19.  It was probably Reagan.  Beginning of Reagan.  I remember 13.  Yeah.  End of Carter.  And I remember calling in.  What did you want to say?  To the White House? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  What were you going to do?  Wow.  You got through.  I don't know.  I was just 12.  You wanted to just see if you could do it.  Yeah.  I used to call the FBI all the time.  You don't think.  You were really on the edge.  I was antisocial.  Yeah.  You're really like.  I don't even know if it went through.  It might have just been the operator.  I don't even know if she actually got me through to the White House.  You were one of those kids like that.  If my mother.  Like my mother used to keep tabs on our friends a little bit.  And you were one of those that she would say.  I really don't want you hanging out with that boy.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  That Jimmy Norton boy.  I think you'd be that kid.  I never knew when the joke was over.  I remember.  I was thinking this this morning on the way.  I was listening to this song by Kiss called Do You Love Me?  And at the end of the song they just keep repeating.  Do you love me?  It just keeps repeating it.  But I remember me and my friend Lutzy.  We're listening.  Lutzy.  Yeah.  You don't see Lutzies anymore.  There's no Lutzy.  Can Lutzy come out and play?  I was at Lutzy's house.  And the Kiss record was playing.  And every time they would say Do You Love Me? 
[02:56:00]  I would just scream no.  And jump up and pretend I was stepping on the record.  But it happened so many times that it just got uncomfortable and unfunny.  And his father came in and was like, could you be quiet?  There we go.  There it is.  Do it, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Stomp on that record.  No.  No.  That's in Edison, though.  I was like in third grade or second grade.  Yeah.  No.  I remember this one.  No.  I was just like trying to be funny. 
[02:56:30]  Do you ever hear songs today and remember where a skip was in the song?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  The song before, I was Kiss Destroyer.  And on the way in, do you want me to listen to the whole song?  Yeah, right.  There's a song called Flaming Youth, which I don't know what that was about.  Paul Stanley sang it.  But there's a song, getting it together to break out of my cage, which is the line, and 
[02:57:00]  my record would skip and it would go brage, like it would ache out of my cage would be  taken out.  And I hear that now, and that's 30 years ago, and I still fucking wait for that skip.  That's fucked up, because I know exactly what you're talking about, that's happened with  a few songs where, yeah, you played them on a record.  So many times.  And it skipped in the same place.  And, yeah, and you hear the song now, and you expect to hear the skip.  You ever put a nickel on it or a penny to try to fucking make it not skip?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But then it just makes the rest of the song slow and not skipping? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes the needle would be so fucked up, it would just go right across the whole record.  I was so bad.  I used to always not know what the lyrics, like, I would always misinterpret lyrics and  think they were saying other things.  And you would sing along to it?  Wrong lyrics?  Yeah.  I was wrong lyrics, kid.  Wrong lyrics, kid.  No, yeah, I was, um, um, no, but in the beginning of Do You Love Me, the line is, you really 
[02:58:00]  like my limousine, but I didn't know what that was at that age.  I thought he was saying, you really like Muzzy Muzzy.  What was that?  Isn't he the contender to take over in Egypt?  I didn't know what that was.  The contender.  The contender.  What the fuck, dude?  It's embarrassing.  That is embarrassing.  You didn't just, you really did do dopey things as a kid, and you kind of, like, they're so  embarrassing sometimes when you think about it. 
[02:58:30]  I, I, once we, my cousins came up from, uh, like Maryland and, uh, and we went in the  backyard to play and, and we, we, I thought we could fish.  There wasn't a lake around or anything, so I dug a hole with a little spade shovel and  filled it up with water and, and put these twigs with thread and, and, uh, uh, safety  pin on it in, in the water hole and convinced everybody and myself that the fish are able 
[02:59:00]  to dig tunnels with their tails and we'll end up in this hole and we'll catch fish.  And then, and then we had to go somewhere and we came back and the whole time we were  gone, all I was thinking is I can't wait to get home and, and pull this fish out of  this little hole that was dug.  And I got home and of course the, the, the dirt soaked up the water in like two seconds  and, and it was just a little mud hole with no fish.  It's a little pile of inoculated arms.  But I thought there would be fish. 
[02:59:30]  I really was psyched.  But it sounds like the beginning of a child abuse movie.  You know what I mean?  It has that creepy, like it, there's a weird innocence slash imagination going on, but  you know, it's covering up some horrific fucking abuse at all.  It was just dopey kid thinking.  You're on your hands and knees digging the hole and trying to block out the fact that  your hiney is on fire.  It feels like a flame is being put into it, but it's really just the, uh, the average  sized genitals of a much older man. 
[03:00:00]  Jesus.  But it feels like firing your backside.  Fire in my, in my bung hole.  And no, I just, I was a dopey kid who like actually convinced myself.  And it was all I would think about the, the entire time we had to go to the store and  I was like, Oh, I want to get home.  The fish.  Yeah.  And I think I started crying when there was no fish.  And that could mean just horrific shit.  Of course I would cry at every time.  I used to steal movie lines and like try to make them my own. 
[03:00:30]  Oh no.  Like what?  Like serious ones?  Oh yeah.  Oh no.  Yeah.  Not like doing funny comedy.  You'd be like, no.  You would try to make people think that you came up with this shit?  I would just like say them.  Like I remember there's a scene.  Would you change it?  If I had to.  But I remember there's a scene and guess who's coming to dinner where Sidney Poitier  yells at his father.  His father was like a postal worker.  My dad was too.  So I used the same speech on my dad. 
[03:01:00]  No.  It was.  I remember seeing that.  Yeah.  Did he know you were using it?  I don't know.  He had to.  He was like, wait a minute.  My kid's doing movie.  There's one line in there that says, you think of yourself as a colored man.  I think of myself as a man.  I don't think I said that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have thrown that in.  Probably not appropriate.  But it's embarrassing.  Do you remember one line from it that you actually said to him about postal worker?  It was something about, I don't care if you carry that bag 30 or 90,000 miles. 
[03:01:30]  You did what you were supposed to do because you owed me like as the son.  It was a good speech.  It's a pretty good monologue.  Because it was written by a fucking like an Academy Award winning writer.  It was pretty good by when Sidney Poitier said it.  Yeah.  When he delivered it.  Not Jimmy Norton.  Young fucking plagiaristic Jimmy Norton.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't as good when I was standing there on my steps in North Brunswick, like in my  house, yelling it up at them, trying to shoehorn it in.  Just trying to use it.  And they were just reading the paper, ignoring me. 
[03:02:00]  Who cares?  That's hilarious, dude.  Additioning little faggot.  Oh, how fucking, ew.  Cringy, dumb kid stuff.  Whoa, Reagan's stepping down?  Hello.  Why?  Oh, look at that.  Why is he stepping?  I don't know.  Farewell address to the nation.  Oh, it was today.  President Reagan's stepping down today.  Breaking news on 5th.  January 11th.  Oh, well, then what the hell is it?  Oh, is it his 100th birthday?  Yeah.  What?  Whatever.  What happened?  Reagan appointee hands.  Oh, it was a Reagan appointee that handed down the ruling that health care law is unconstitutional. 
[03:02:30]  Did I ever tell you one of the first jokes I ever wrote, like, when I first started doing comedy?  Oh, yeah.  That was about Reagan.  And I was like, yeah, Reagan was, uh, Reagan.  Oh, no, I didn't write it.  Actually, it was what I did before I did comedy.  I thought it'd be funny if I said, like, uh, yeah, Reagan, uh, was an actor, and now he's president.  He's still acting.  Who's the first lady, Jane Wyman?  You didn't like my joke that I wrote?  No, no, that's, uh, still acting.  Get it? 
[03:03:00]  Man.  Oh, boy, were you fucking profound.  No, I just thought it was clever wordplay.  I'm the clever.  He's still acting.  That's a good joke?  Uh, no.  I don't like it.  I don't find it funny at all.  It wasn't.  It's not a home run.  It's fucking horrible.  Do you know one of the first jokes I ever did on stage, and this is at the Varsity Pub in 1990.  It was stupid.  I said something about a black hole.  They found a black hole, and it turns out it was just Oprah laying spread eagle. 
[03:03:30]  No, you didn't say that.  It was a big Oprah pussy joke.  That's one of the first jokes I ever did say.  You didn't say that.  I did.  Did it get a laugh?  No, I wouldn't.  It was horrible.  Of course not.  It got exactly what it should have, a zero, and uncomfortable stares.  All right, you've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next. 
[03:04:00]  You've noticed.  You've been able to close, and you're looking to J-I-S-Tες.  You've been able to carry this Olympics.  You've been able to carry this forward a golden and tail В-I-S-TEN.  You've been able to do it.  You're watching the Olympics.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Once you've done what you've had, your guest, enjoyed the Universe.  You've been able to be understood.  Have you come back a minute.  Just wait, looks for you, that are you.  What are you doing?  The best tales are out.  Might be true.  If you've done one of the mostковosies.  You've tried.  You've been able to find theions where you're doing it with you. </pre>
