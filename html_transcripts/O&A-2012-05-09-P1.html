<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the hostsâ€™ and Jim Norton's illnesses, particularly Anthony's suspected pertussis.  Concerns were raised about the contagiousness of the illness, the potential cancellation of Donald Trump Jr.'s scheduled appearance, and the risk of illness affecting Sam's upcoming wedding.  Opie also discussed his strained relationships with former colleagues, specifically mentioning Jeremy Coleman, and his feelings about his reputation.  A significant portion focused on Sam's interview with Lisa Lampanelli following her firing from *Celebrity Apprentice*, and the reasons for Lampanelli's absence from the Opie and Anthony show.  Norton shared a story about an uncomfortable encounter with a masseuse.  The hosts speculated on John Travolta's ongoing legal issues. Tom Papa joined the show in studio later in this segment, commenting on the general sickness and atmosphere. Norton recounted accidentally drinking Jim's sick water at the Comedy Cellar.

The show continued with a recollection of a past radio appearance with Sarah and No Name, where Opie's off-air presence led to a poorly received joke.  This transitioned into a discussion of their experiences in Dallas, described as a "weird market" with prevalent concealed weapons. The hosts then strongly voiced their anti-establishment views regarding the North Carolina ban on gay marriage.  They detailed the rejection of an advertisement for "Boy Butter,"  a male lubricant, due to its explicit nature.  The conversation became highly personal, veering into humorous discussions about penises,  their upbringings (including unusual chores), and the challenges of dealing with difficult family members, particularly their mothers and mothers-in-law,  describing their manipulative and narcissistic behaviors.  They discussed strategies for managing these relationships. The segment ended with plans for a double date and Mother's Day preparations.

The next segment began with a ProFlowers commercial for Mother's Day.  A game to guess an Eminem song led to a discussion of the graphic lyrics in "My Mom" and other songs from *Relapse*, debating the relationship between explicit lyrics and truth.  The conversation returned to John Travolta and the allegations of sexual misconduct from two masseurs, with the hosts reading excerpts from the lawsuits and debating their credibility.  Jimmy, with massage therapy experience, offered insights.  The discussion included personal anecdotes about massages, water bottle hygiene, and personal lives.  The hosts then discussed the death of Maurice Sendak and *Where the Wild Things Are*, and the New York Rangers' playoff run. A caller shared a similar, decades-old story about John Travolta.

The following segment started with a discussion of Andy Pettitte's return to baseball, quickly devolving into vulgar and sexually explicit banter.  The conversation shifted to the new Brooklyn Nets logo and Josh Hamilton's home run performance.  A caller's claim of being a potential Olympic swimmer prompted further crude remarks.  A substantial portion was dedicated to Sacha Baron Cohen's *The Dictator*, including discussion of the trailer, previous work, and his apparent endorsement of Mitt Romney in character.  The hosts noted Cohen's recent presence in the building but appearance only on Howard Stern's show. A clip from *The Dictator*'s press conference showing the endorsement was played; Tom Papa expressed negative opinions about the film.  The show then touched on *The Avengers*' box office success, followed by more vulgar exchanges and personal anecdotes.  The hosts then discussed "cloud guy," playing clips and expressing extreme disdain.  The segment concluded with a discussion of spirituality and the paranormal, including personal anecdotes involving dreams, Ouija boards, psychics, and listener calls sharing similar experiences.  The segment concluded with more vulgar banter and personal stories.

The final segment began with a discussion about death and grief, prompted by a listener's comment on Jim Norton's reaction to loss.  Norton vehemently denied the listener's implication, using profanity.  Norton described recurring dreams about Patrice O'Neal. Opie attempted mind-reading tricks.  A Sherry's Berries commercial aired, with discussion of the product and cake pops.  Tom Papa, again a guest, promoted his upcoming show at Foxwoods.  The segment concluded with further promotion of the show and Papa's social media.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning!  What do we got? We got day three of Anthony's sickness.  We got day two of the sleep apnea mask with Jim Norton.  And Jim's sickness.  And day two of Jimmy being sick.  Today's Wednesday.  Oh, you've been sick for three days.  Ah, shit!  And the mask I'm not wearing.  Today, I'm going to give it a few days or a week because people even... 
[00:00:30]  The fans are really nice when it comes to stuff.  They're awful with other stuff.  When you need medical help, they really are pretty cool, man.  They sent me a lot of emails and stuff at Twitter and tweets about...  You can give it a week or so.  You can get info on any subject through our fans.  It rules.  You throw a little bait out there and they'll nibble and you'll know everything about that topic.  I was very prepared when that sleep apnea woman came over.  I knew what I wanted and it's just... 
[00:01:00]  I want to try to sleep with it.  I had the mask upside down, which is humiliating.  Is that what was going on?  That's why you didn't sleep yesterday?  No.  Or the day before?  What day are we at?  Yesterday's show, you were tired.  I'm tired of all day every day.  I kept waking up.  I was dreaming that I was on Game of Thrones, which I watched it last night.  And I just kept dreaming.  Were you having sex?  No, I was just hanging out with the midget.  Yeah, but why would you be on the show if you're not having sex?  I probably wouldn't want to be one of the sexual...  They wouldn't make me one of the sexual characters. 
[00:01:30]  But you were hanging out with the midget.  And I just kept thinking Lannister and going back.  Did I listen to Ted Lannister before I went to bed?  Right.  Yeah, because I just watched it and thought of that bit.  And then I just fucking kept waking up.  Not breathing.  Do you sleep on your belly?  That seems to keep some of that shit open.  Maybe.  I think it does, man.  And I was congested.  It's horrible.  It's just torture.  What were you doing with the midget?  I don't remember.  It wasn't anything in particular. 
[00:02:00]  I just remember talking and saying something Lannister.  Lannister.  Lannister, really?  Yeah, that's all I remember.  What I know is him.  There's nothing weird, though.  We weren't doing anything.  We were just hanging out with him.  You go to the doctor?  I did, and she said...  She doesn't think you have the pertussis?  Nah, she listened to my back.  She listened to my chest.  And she had me breathe deep.  And she's like, it's not that.  She's upper respiratory.  And she gave me a Z-Pak, but I don't know if I'm going to take it.  I'll see today if I need to take it.  Right.  My doctor says if Anthony has pertussis, we'll all get it. 
[00:02:30]  We just work way too closely together.  I don't think that's what it is.  He's a really bad cold.  He keeps saying he has it.  Oh.  We went back and forth on text a little bit yesterday.  Oh, really?  Okay.  He says, let me see.  Where the fuck is this shit?  I'm not giving anything away here.  What do you say?  Fucking...  How are you feeling?  He wrote, worst sick I've ever been, man.  Wow.  Worst ever. 
[00:03:00]  This is horrible.  I'm coughing like Don Corleone in the tomato plants.  Fever fucking sucks.  And then I just asked him, is it pertussis?  He says, yeah, fucking whooping cough, unreal, waiting for the antibiotics to kick in.  I haven't slept more than a couple of hours.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Wow.  He's in bad shape.  So he's swearing by the pertussis.  Yeah.  I'm sure he has it.  Wow.  Fuck.  I'm so happy I was...  You're so fucked, Sam.  I was gone the week before, too.  I didn't see that the week before. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  So I'm going to be the non-pertussis kid.  We were all pertussing it up and shit.  I'm going to be the non-pertussis kid, too.  So...  Why are you going to have non-pertussis?  Because I took a different flight to Cleveland.  Oh, fuck.  I did fly with him.  I think it all went down on that Cleveland fucking flight.  But you don't think we're going to get it from being in the studio with him the week  after Cleveland?  I don't know.  How many days has it been?  I think we're almost out of the woods.  Yeah.  I mean, we were in here with him...  A whole week.  For five days.  Five days of him coughing. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Dropless into the air.  And that's how you get it.  Was he coughing bad?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That was bad.  Yeah, especially on, like, the Thursday and Friday.  Right.  Because he had the cold symptoms first.  Mm-hmm.  Which they say that's how pertussis starts.  So what are you doing?  Are you disinfecting and shit?  Well...  You're taking your emergency?  You're getting married in three and a half weeks.  I'm drinking emergency.  Right.  Going out of style.  Right.  As soon as I start to show a symptom, I'm going to get a Z-Pack. 
[00:04:30]  I'm not going to wait in the doctor's waiting room if I don't have any symptoms.  But as soon as I start to show a symptom, I'm getting Z-Packs up the ass.  Not literally.  Figuratively.  You can only have one.  How many pills is it?  It's like four pills or something?  Six pills?  Five pills?  Five, right?  It goes one, two, two or something?  Yeah, those Z-Packs could fucking clear you out.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm going to do whatever it takes.  I can't.  I can't have any pertussis.  No.  The only thing I'm happy about is that we found out about this, so that way if I start 
[00:05:00]  to have cold symptoms, I'm not just going to think it's a cold.  You sound a little nasally.  That's what my mom said, right?  Yeah, I hear it.  I'm not...  Your mom must be paranoid.  Of course she is.  And very worried.  Is she worried about you?  Yeah.  She's extremely worried, right?  Yeah.  Well, she also...  She said you and Opie both sounded like nasally.  I mean, she acknowledged that Jim is obviously not feeling well, but that's what Jim said.  I felt like I had something coming on yesterday, but I feel way better fucking today.  I feel better every time I go home, and then every time I get back in this studio, I feel 
[00:05:30]  sick again.  Yeah, well, a lot of the listeners yesterday on Twitter, they're saying, just listening  to you guys, they think they have it now.  Yeah.  They're paranoid.  They got scratchy throats in there, and they're sniffling.  It's highly contagious.  Well, not that contagious where they could get it through the radio.  I don't know.  It's satellite radio.  Well, that's true.  Satellite radio is different.  It's a whole different thing.  You're fucking right about that.  Yeah.  My throat really hurts.  It looks like it hurts.  We should stop coming to work.  I know. 
[00:06:00]  I know.  Anyone sick, just go home.  Just go home.  Everyone, go home.  Please, just go home.  We can't fuck up Sam's wedding.  Yeah, well, there's no ratings.  We'll just leave the channel live, and nobody talks.  It doesn't matter.  If we walked away right now, it would probably take a year before the audience would start  dropping off.  I'm not even kidding.  There's no ratings.  There's no books.  We don't need to be here.  No, these guys are signed up, so they got their money.  Yeah.  You know, when it comes to renewal, then they'll start dropping out a little bit.  You're right. 
[00:06:30]  We should all just go home.  Nobody's going to unsubscribe if everybody stops showing up for six weeks.  But it's becoming a little dramatic, because Donald Trump Jr. is basically saying, fuck  that.  What?  Well, he was scheduled for next week.  He's like, with all the rumors of this whooping cough shit, I think I might not come.  He's not coming in?  He's not sure.  He's scared, like everybody else.  It's becoming a thing.  What about DJ Who Kid?  He was in here.  Yeah, I don't think he knows about the protesters.  Oh, you didn't tell him?  No, he was obsessed with you yelling at E-Rock yesterday, so we didn't even get to that. 
[00:07:00]  Why was he obsessed with that?  Because we played the clip again.  Why would you do that?  Because Sal brings in his favorite clips of the day now, and that was definitely one  of them.  Why was it his favorite clip of the day?  I felt, I looked like a complete asshole.  Well, let's be honest, you tearing E-Rock a new asshole yesterday morning was probably  the big moment of the show.  Sal, E-Rock, did you appreciate Sal bringing the clip back into the show?  Not really, no. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, I didn't either.  I actually played it twice.  Why would you do that?  Because a caller...  I look like an asshole.  What was the clip?  Opie yelling at E-Rock in the morning.  I don't remember it.  You don't?  I don't remember it.  Do you want me to find the clip?  No, no, no, I don't want it anymore.  I love the people that try to call me out on being an asshole.  Like, I don't know that that looks bad.  It is what it is.  We let it all hang out on this show.  But a caller...  Sometimes it's an ugly thing.  A caller called up and said he was out of his car when I played the clip, so I had to  play it again for that caller.  You're a shit stirrer.  No. 
[00:08:00]  It's not the worst thing in the world, but you are a shit stirrer.  Well, in that case, he needed to hear...  I'm a man of the people.  Get to give the audience what they want.  Why wouldn't you protect my legacy?  That is your legacy.  Being an asshole?  Yes.  I'm not going out that way.  Well, you've got a lot of work to do.  No, I don't.  You've still got a lot of bridges to rebuild.  No.  You think he's burned a lot of bridges?  Yeah, and he hasn't rebuilt any of them.  I've built a few.  He's just maintained some of them.  Like what?  What bridges have you maintained? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, you're still cool with Stump Brain.  That's a maintained bridge.  I love the Stump Brain.  That was a bridge that never got burned, though.  That was a bridge that was always...  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  Because he's a smart, intelligent guy that knows what he's fucking doing.  I like those type of people.  I like Stump Brain, too.  But I don't think you've actually rebuilt any bridges.  I think you've just maintained some and given yourself credit for rebuilding those,  even though they were never broken.  Really.  Me and Tim Sabian are kind of good.  Are you?  I nodded to Jeremy Coleman the other day. 
[00:09:00]  Those don't count as rebuilding bridges.  A guy that I used to do lunch with three, four days a week.  We almost nod now.  That's good.  This is what I'm talking about.  You spend all his time.  You say horrible things about people for hours.  Jeremy Coleman is a fucking prick, Sam.  And that's the end of that bridge.  Because he's very powerful here at SiriusX Hammer.  One of the reasons is because he worked with us at NEW.  And now he barely could nod at me.  All right.  See, that's not...  Yeah, I got him fired.  But guess what?  He landed nice.  The people with talent landed nice after all that shit. 
[00:09:30]  Well, that's sort of a backhanded compliment, but not a rebuilt bridge whatsoever.  What?  It's not a rebuilt bridge.  I would have to agree with Sam that it's not a rebuilt bridge.  Do you like Jeremy Coleman?  To be honest with you, I'll be totally honest.  I have no...  I don't dislike him, or...  He's a nice guy.  I say hi.  I don't...  I'm just extremely disappointed in him.  I was never friends with him before.  We were really...  We were pretty close.  He's fine.  I mean...  We were pretty close, and now it's like we nod.  Really?  I don't think Jeremy Coleman likes me. 
[00:10:00]  Like, that's how you feel.  Like, I don't dislike him, but I don't think he likes me.  And I'm not saying that that's true.  Right.  But sometimes we feel like people don't like us, and we automatically go, like, well,  fuck them, too.  Right.  When the reality is they don't dislike us.  Why don't you think he likes you?  There's no reason for it.  There's no logical reason.  It's just a vibe I get.  But maybe he's just that guy.  Maybe he just doesn't...  He's kind of to himself, and maybe he doesn't say, you know...  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know anything about him anymore, so whatever.  But, like, you can't...  Thank you, guys.  I said hi to them yesterday.  But that's what I'm saying. 
[00:10:30]  You can't shit on people.  I asked the one guy how his fucking knee is, because it buckled in front of us, and he  went down hard.  So I showed concern, and I talked to him a little bit.  But you can't shit on people.  And he was pretty happy about it.  You can't shit on people for, like, hours at a time?  Right.  And then just be like, hey, and think that because you said, hey, that makes up for all  the hours.  Well, I don't shit on those guys.  Well, you know, you have said nasty things about them.  Not really.  We kind of had to, though.  In the beginning, we did.  They started.  They started.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They did start with their power.  Yeah, they started that shit.  And then they were fine.  Jay Thomas grunted at me the other day. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, but that was, I think, passive-aggressive.  That was not a reboot.  On his part?  Yes.  I just ignored it.  Right.  I'm like, whatever.  If you have something to say, how about you say it?  Because he's aggressive.  You grunted.  He's passive-aggressive, and you're aggressive-aggressive.  I'm very aggressive.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  I should have had my teeth knocked out years ago.  If he had done anything besides grunt, you probably would have said something really  nasty to him.  What about Alex Bennett?  He won't move out of my way when I try to go to the bathroom, because he's all pissed  off.  That bridge is burned to the ground.  That's not even a bridge, though.  That's a justifiable. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, he started that shit.  He started it again.  That's not your fault.  A lot of these things, the other side starts it.  Right.  He didn't like us from day one.  I actually respected what he used to do in radio.  I have no idea what he does now, to be completely honest with you.  I have no idea, but...  He gets jealous about TVs.  Huh?  He gets jealous about TVs.  Well, you know, this is part of our old deal.  Yeah.  Well, we're missing one.  I'm kind of mad.  We should have nine in here, not eight.  How many TVs does everyone else have? 
[00:12:00]  Probably the average is around zero, I would think.  Or maybe a small...  Zero?  A small, like, kitchen TV.  So you think these guys, when they walk by here, get really annoyed to see eight TVs?  Why not?  Because one of them broke.  We should have one right here.  We should have nine TVs in here.  Is that obnoxious, you think?  It's also the fact that we have four giant TVs in our offices.  Oh, we do?  Yeah.  So we own, like, 12 TVs here?  Well, if you remember... 
[00:12:30]  The show, anyway.  We went through the hallways, our first broadcast at SiriusXM.  We extended the mics from the studio all the way down to, like, where the offices are.  Right.  And announced to everybody working here how many TVs we had.  And it was, what, 13 at the time?  Yeah, people were annoyed by that.  We're down at 12.  And that kind of pisses you off a little bit.  Yeah, I think we should get this one fixed.  Yeah.  Where's the other TV?  How many TVs do you think we need in here?  Two.  Two?  Maybe three?  Sure, three for energy.  We're all facing different ways. 
[00:13:00]  But we have eight.  We have eight right now.  You and Anthony could easily look at those three.  Yeah.  Or the three behind me.  The two behind you helped me, and Anthony could look at them, too.  Yeah.  But I don't think he does.  Right.  No, I don't even look at these TVs.  Yeah, I mean, those...  They just look good.  Those three you don't need at all.  No.  I don't need...  I can't even see the one behind you.  Right.  That one we could easily give somebody if we were nice guys.  There's at least five TVs in the studio that you don't need at all.  No.  Like, you don't use them.  No.  You think it would be nice of us to maybe give TVs to other shows? 
[00:13:30]  I think so.  Well, that ain't happening.  You're not going to do that?  Fuck no.  Okay.  Why would I?  The morning mashup doesn't have a TV.  They don't need one.  What do they need a TV for?  I guess, to stay up on pop culture.  I don't even know what they do.  They play the hits, mainly.  Stanley T. doesn't want to play the hits.  No.  At all.  I don't think Stanley T. wants to be there that soon.  Stanley T. wants to play the message from Hotel Rwanda.  Yeah, he does.  He's happy to be here, but he absolutely doesn't want to be playing the dumb hits. 
[00:14:00]  No.  It's a dumb show.  I'm doing good.  Well, no, actually, you're slowly burning the bridge.  There might be some good news.  With what?  Just people having, you know, interest in certain things.  This radio show.  But Ant's not here, so let's see.  We'll all talk about it.  But it hasn't been talked about because the three of us aren't together.  Which thing?  I'll tell you off.  It's good. 
[00:14:30]  Possible.  With the thing?  Maybe, yeah.  That you're involved with?  Possible.  Possible.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, it can be a good thing.  That can be a good thing for everybody.  We need to put our heads together.  Really?  Yeah.  Is Bob Eatman aware of any of this?  Oh, yeah.  He is?  Oh, very.  Well, that would be nice if you would have told me about it.  Well, he probably just doesn't know anything because Jonathan is on it.  Oh.  Sam interviewed Lisa Lampanelli, a big star from Celebrity Apprentice.  Is she still on the show?  No, she got fired on Sunday. 
[00:15:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Well, I've been making believe I've been watching the show.  Yeah, no, no, no.  She got fired on Sunday.  Oh.  There's only two more episodes left and she'll be on both of them.  So who's left?  The final four, no, the final three are Arsenio, Clay Aiken, and Aubrey O'Day.  That's who's left?  Yep.  Arsenio Hall for the win.  You think so?  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:15:30]  He's desperate.  He needs something.  Those other two people got kind of like careers and stuff.  Arsenio has that desperation of knowing his career is over.  He's taking all this fake shit very seriously.  Yeah.  Mark it down.  He wins.  Okay.  Guarantee.  But you asked Lisa Lampanelli why she doesn't do our show.  This is like, this is huge.  Yeah, because, you know.  I'm extremely disappointed in Lisa Lampanelli.  We all go way back with her.  Way the fuck back with her.  She officially has never done our show, I don't think.  But, you know, we all know the same people. 
[00:16:00]  I ran into her on the street and said, hey, man, just come on in.  It'll be cool.  We'll be nice.  Everything's good.  And she actually said at the time, this is a couple years back, it was on the Upper West Side,  yeah, we'd really like to do that.  Yeah, we've got to figure that out.  And it has never happened.  Based on the interview yesterday, I think she'd be a great guest on this show.  I think she would be.  I, for the record, was against the interview happening.  Yeah.  For the record, I was against it.  And I love Lisa.  She's been a friend of mine for 15, maybe closer to 20 years.  Yeah, we just don't play the same fucking game as other people around here. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  But that's what I try to explain to her.  These people got to be their own people.  You know, if you're talented like Lisa Lampanelli, stop worrying about pissing people off.  Yeah.  And do shows that will help your career.  And this one certainly would help as well.  I mean, you know, she's fucking massive right now.  But fuck, man, I hate these people that do this.  It's a weird thing.  I think people are afraid, like Joan Rivers, because Lisa's a very strong personality.  She's certainly not, she's not meek.  Joan is not meek.  Like, they have this fear that how would you be upset with them if they do this show? 
[00:17:00]  And they're very loyal, which I respect their loyalty.  Right.  But I think it's misguided because they don't have to be, it's not an us against, unless Gary or somebody from his show says, look, he would appreciate it if you didn't do that.  You know, maybe that's the truth.  Or maybe he said that and they respect it.  I don't know.  I know for a fact that shit goes on.  You know, boy, Gary's a piece of shit.  You guys can hang out with him all you want.  He's a piece of shit.  Trust me.  That's coming from me.  I speak as an individual. 
[00:17:30]  He's a fucking asshole.  And he has caused a lot of fucking issues between the two fucking shows as a sneak, by the way.  So, yeah, that does go on.  But we've never told our guys not to do Howard or anybody else.  Never.  And we don't need people to come on our show and trash Howard to get him better with us.  And a lot of people that, you know, have gone on Howard have done just that.  They feel like they'll get in better with Howard if they fucking trash O&A.  Just be yourself.  Be a, you know, be a fucking individual.  Right.  If we're going back and forth with him and there's a nasty, that's one thing. 
[00:18:00]  But there's been no, you know.  There's been nothing.  I mean, I saw, I bumped into his, I saw his wife recently.  She's very nice.  She's one of the nicest people ever, honestly.  She couldn't be nicer.  She walked into the comedy cellar with Whitney Cummings.  And I didn't recognize her at first.  I'm sitting there at the table.  And this is a couple weeks ago.  And I, I didn't talk about this, did I?  No.  No.  And I look up and I'm like, she's stunning.  I'm like, Jesus Christ. 
[00:18:30]  I thought she was there for Artie.  Artie Foucault.  Because all those hot chicks like him.  I'm like, she must be one of Arties.  Oh, you didn't even know who it was at first.  Because she had a hat on.  And I just, I just wasn't expecting to see her at the comedy cellar.  Right.  And then, then she came closer.  I'm like, oh.  So she sat and chatted for a while.  She couldn't be nicer.  Yeah, she's a, she's very nice.  It's like talking, literally, it's like talking to a fucking magazine cover.  She's that, she looks that good in person.  It's fucking.  She seems pretty normal, too.  You just feel ugly.  So.  I just feel ugly when I talk to a fucking hot girl.  No, really?  Dude, it's, it's, it's, but she wants, she has a, a lot of women who are that hot have 
[00:19:00]  a nice way of kind of not, because there's not, not that type of vibe there, because you  know she's nice.  Right.  So it was, uh, it was a pleasant chat, but if I was trying to hit on somebody like that,  I'd be fucking finished.  They'd have to be really damaged radio show fans for me to even think of it.  We could just sit down and chat, but when there's not that dynamic.  Right.  It's just, you know, it's very, very nice.  Um, Sam, talk to Lisa Lampanelli about, uh, why not doing our show, and this is her answer. 
[00:19:30]  You should do, uh, Opie and Anthony.  I know, it's such a goddamn fucking can of worms, it pisses me off.  It's not a can, I'm gonna stop this a lot, I'm sorry.  It's not a can of worms.  At all.  You just come on our show, because we know all the same people, you're really funny,  we do respect you, and we think you're, you're very talented.  That's the only reason.  There's no can of worms on our part.  And I mean, it's not, it doesn't, like.  So what the fuck goes on in the other camp that there's a can of worms? 
[00:20:00]  She obviously has been talked to.  Well, the guys who do both shows, it does great things for them.  Like, Colin Quain does both shows, and Brewer and Florentine, like.  The Apollo.  The Apollo, yeah.  We've never asked any of those guys to make a fucking choice.  Of course not.  God.  There's no can of worms.  Mm-mm.  That's not coming from us.  It proves, uh, it proves my points.  Damn fucking can of worms.  It pisses me off, because I'm such big fans of them, and I love them.  Yeah, and you know, we know you're a big, uh, Howard supporter and everything. 
[00:20:30]  I'm so confused.  Yeah.  Just that you, please convey to them that I think they're phenomenal, and I listen to  the show, and I fucking love them, and they take chances a lot of people don't, and that  I really love, so they're my, some of my.  But just in terms of not pissing who off and what you did.  To the extent of, I don't want to make anybody mad at me.  I've got this whole, like, thing with now, I want to do a show on maybe the Broadway channel,  and it's like, I'm just trying to, like, do so many different things that I feel, because  I have the Broadway show coming out.  Right.  So I'm just confused. 
[00:21:00]  So maybe someday everything will get settled, but I do, if you could just convey my mind.  It's just simply behind the scenes.  That's all it is.  That's behind the scenes.  She's trying not to say it.  Yeah.  And.  There's stuff that has been said to her.  It's always going to be that way until the two shows get along.  And after the interview, she said, play the clip for them, and they'll understand what  I'm talking about.  I know.  Because I don't understand, and I'll never understand, because it doesn't come from us.  Right.  We've never told a person not to do another radio show, ever.  Ever. 
[00:21:30]  We'd like some people to be maybe a little loyal, you know?  Yeah.  And do our show first if we really have helped out their careers over the years.  But, I mean, like Amy Schumer is now doing Howard as well.  Not once did we sit down, Amy, and go, you know, we wish you wouldn't do that.  Right.  And she's such a good, she's a real friend, man.  Like, Amy called.  She wasn't asking permission.  She's her own person.  She goes, there's not any problem, right?  Because she wanted to do it.  God, no.  And I'm like, no, no, we don't give a shit at all.  Right.  That's not coming from us, period. 
[00:22:00]  But people.  So maybe.  Sorry.  No, that's okay.  I think people, I think, know that.  There's just, I think certain things have been probably very difficult to overcome down  the hall.  So maybe someday everything will get settled.  But I do, if you could just convey my mad respect for them, it's so true.  I will.  I'll give them the clip of what you just said and everything.  And it is weird.  I do mean it.  Under one roof, like one company.  And nobody's ever given me an order not to do anything.  I just feel like my career is so tenuous and so, like, hanging in the balance that, 
[00:22:30]  like, I'm not going to piss anybody off.  I understand that, too.  That's the way comedians think.  That's mixed messages, though, a little bit, right?  Comedians are all, none of us think we deserve anything we get.  We're all fucking paranoid kooks.  Right.  And when things are going good, you're afraid you're going to make the one move that collapses.  Every comic, and actors may be the same, but I can only speak to comics.  You always worry, when are they going to realize that I don't deserve this and they're going  to take it all away? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  We all worry about every good thing I have.  So she's probably thinking, like, things are going great.  If I do this one thing, it's going to shift the balance and the whole thing's going to  collapse.  I understand that.  It sounds crazy, but it's the way comics think.  On the level that you and Lisa are at?  Well, a little I'm at on the level Lisa's at are different levels.  No, I know, but I mean, either.  I do want to add something to this.  This has been going on for years, way before Lisa Lampanelli blew up big time, by the way.  So why wasn't she doing the show back then?  Oh, I don't know about that. 
[00:23:30]  Because they may hear just certain moments of this show, and then when they hear certain  moments, they don't listen to the whole show, and they just assume that's the tone of the  show.  And it's like, if they hear, if we're saying certain things, and they hear that, they  got to be like, all right, I can't.  Like, if I turned on Howard, or any other show, and heard someone saying about Opie and  Anthony, like, Opie's a fucking, or Anthony's a cunt, or whatever it was, I'll go, fuck  that, I ain't doing that show. 
[00:24:00]  Even if it was just a momentary thing, they hear that, and they're like, why would they  do it?  Because they don't want to piss off their guy.  Well, I wish, I do wish she didn't feel that way, because we do like her, and we do know  pretty much all the same people.  So, maybe she'll figure it out someday.  I hope she wins Celebrity Apprentice, though.  She already got fired.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  She still did really good, the fucking four people out?  Yeah, and she said she didn't care that she got fired, because she gets to come back  for the second, for the second to last in the last episodes anyway, so. 
[00:24:30]  Why?  Because she's...  If you make it this far, you get to be in all the shows?  Well, you help out on the last task, and then everybody comes back for the finale,  so she made it...  You just want the exposure.  That's just, she admitted it.  She was like...  It's a fake job.  She said, I don't care.  She said the charity was secondary.  She wanted to get more famous.  Oh, it's only...  Oh, they give money to charity now.  Yeah.  All charity, yeah.  At first, I thought they made it a fake job, that he hired...  Because doesn't he go, you're hired?  Yeah.  He says you're hired.  Because originally, it was the regular apprentice, where he was... 
[00:25:00]  Right.  Quote, unquote...  What are those guys?  Are they still working for Trump, you think?  I doubt it.  Did one of them do the Trump Chicago...  I stayed in that fucking building.  God damn, is that hotel like...  Really?  Dude, I went to Chicago to stay in that hotel.  Wasn't that Donald Jr.'s building?  It might have been, but it's...  I had such a weird obsession with that building, because I would see it every time I hit Chicago.  Yeah.  And I had a weekend...  I just went for one night.  I literally just stayed by myself.  I did nothing.  You flew there?  I flew to Chicago.  What else was going on in Chicago?  Literally nothing. 
[00:25:30]  You flew to be in a hotel?  I know it sounds crazy, but I had to do it.  There are nice hotels in New York you could do that.  You could have taken a cab.  It was one of those things where I was depressed because I'm single and I had nothing to do,  and I'm like, fucking, you know what?  I can do this.  It didn't cost that much.  It was miles.  Why not do it?  Just do something weird.  I never, ever, ever do shit like that.  I was home in 24 hours.  How long was the flight?  An hour.  And I just checked in.  I fucking relaxed.  I just did nothing. 
[00:26:00]  You didn't go anywhere in Chicago?  No.  You just stayed in the hotel?  Yeah, I went out to eat with a friend of mine, and that was the end of it.  Wow.  It was no funny business.  I'm fucking 43% funny business, but it was nothing.  You sure you didn't go to Chicago to do some John Travolting?  Dude, I don't need that.  I don't need to go to Chicago for it.  Did you go to Chicago to do some John Travolting?  I kind of like that.  Although, I will say, I have booked gigs around people I wanted to have sex with.  Yes.  You have?  Not in a long time, but yeah.  Since Craigslist cleaned up, that hasn't happened. 
[00:26:30]  But there have been people I wanted to fucking see.  I've actually booked my gigs around that.  That's a sex addict.  Wow.  Dude, do you understand?  When you go to Seattle because there's a girl who you think has a meaty pussy because  of her Craigslist picture.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, years ago I did that.  And your fans think you're going because you just love Seattle.  Yeah, I don't give a fuck about that rainy shithouse.  You're booking gigs for girls.  That rules.  I'm sure bands and all that do that.  Of course.  I like Seattle, though. 
[00:27:00]  I do, too.  I really do like Seattle.  I don't draw as well in the Pacific Northwest.  Like in Portland, the club that was called the Helium.  And it's a great club.  And the crowds that showed up were fucking really nice.  But I drew very like, eh.  It's too far away, I think.  It's in a weird part of the country.  That's a big Patton town.  I like Patton Oswalt, David Cross.  I don't do well in that alternative vibe.  Yeah, yeah.  Alternative guys, sort of, huh?  I think so, sure.  I want to go to Portland, Oregon.  Bad.  How about we take the show to Portland, Oregon?  You think we would draw? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  In Portland?  When they come down from Vancouver and all that shit?  Yeah.  Come up from Seattle, maybe?  And then what's the state to the right of Portland?  I'd go with Oregon.  I'm going to go with Washington.  Washington's on the left, I think.  Yeah, Washington.  North Dakota?  I'm going to go with Wisconsin.  I don't know my states.  What is it?  Yeah, they come from Washington. 
[00:28:00]  What's next to Portland?  I'm going to go North Dakota.  Damn it, is North Dakota way up there?  Yeah.  I thought I was in the south.  Idaho is like one of those lost states.  Don't know much about them at all.  Washington, Idaho, Nevada, and California.  Really?  What about North Dakota?  Where are the North Dakotas and the South Dakotas?  Yeah, it goes Oregon, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, really?  So you've got to drive.  I was only off a state or two.  That's not bad.  I hated geography in school.  Fucking hated it.  And also knew that I would never need to know any of that stuff.  All right, what else we got?  John Travolta is a big story, and I think it's just going to unravel.  You think it's just going to get out right now?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  But what I don't like about this, I don't give a fuck if he's gay.  I could care less.  I don't like the fact that these guys are allowed to publicly sue him in a non-criminal case, a non-rape case, and not use their names. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  What the fuck is that shit?  So he can be fucking, even if he's totally clear to this, you're associating him with trying to jerk guys off, and their names don't get dragged.  It drives me nuts how he can be fucking smeared like this, and it's just not fair.  Yeah, that's the system we live in.  I think he did it, too.  We live in.  My opinion is that he did it.  Really?  Yeah, I don't care.  And again, it's pure opinion, but I think he did it, and I also think that his mistake is getting angry. 
[00:29:30]  I think they're saying that he gets angry, and if that's the case, that's his mistake.  And he gets angry when he's not able to jerk these guys off.  You can't freak out on people.  When these guys say no, he gets really pissed off and aggressive.  Yeah.  You've got to be cool about it.  I had a scary incident once with a woman.  It was more angering than it was scary because she wasn't a victim, but me and Kenny were on the road, and something happened a long time ago.  I've never talked about it on the air.  It was a long time ago.  Can you talk about it now or no?  Yeah.  I had, I'm not even going to say what state it was in. 
[00:30:00]  That's fine.  I had gotten a massage.  Idaho.  It was in Idaho.  I said, oh, potato tits.  I can squeeze them.  And I wanted it to be a little bit sexual, and she came over wearing a dress, a sundress.  She wasn't, it wasn't a miniskirt, but it was definitely sexy.  She was rubbing the back of my legs, not doing anything overtly sexual.  Wait, I might have tapped out for a second. 
[00:30:30]  Were you ordering a massage?  Yes.  You were?  Yes, online.  And she came to your hotel?  Yeah, this was a Craigslist.  Okay, gotcha.  But it was on the legit massage section.  And she came to your hotel?  Yeah.  And she was dressed a little sexy?  Yeah, not like a traditional masseuse.  She had big breasts and all that stuff.  And like little things, like she was kind of pressing up against my hand, and little things  that were not overt, but that I know from doing this all the time.  And we were just joking about her doing something and for money, too.  I wouldn't do it for money. 
[00:31:00]  But then I'm like, well, some do, and this and that.  But I let it go.  And then she goes, well, how much do they want when they do stuff like that?  Which immediately, she's willing to talk about this.  So I forget what I said.  But she's like, well, I wouldn't do it on my massage table, because it's work.  So we put the table away, and she let me just rub her ass and jerk off.  That was it.  I didn't have sex with her.  She didn't.  And then she got mad when I was jerking off.  And I'm like, well, that's what I was going to do.  And then she let me do it again.  Twice.  Yeah, and then continue until I came.  But that was it.  I just put my hand up her dress and rubbed her ass. 
[00:31:30]  Nothing.  She was 100% a volunteer.  There was no anger.  I wasn't freaking out.  I was like, whatever.  It's cool if you don't.  And that was it.  And I gave her actually tickets to go to the show that night.  And she showed up with some guy.  And they walked out like 20 minutes into the show.  So I saw her after the show with him.  And I went to shake his hand. 
[00:32:00]  And he pushed my hand away.  Oh, fuck.  And I'm like, well, obviously.  And she's like, he knows.  And I'm like, and Kenny was right there, thank God.  Because I didn't know what she fucking told this guy.  Right.  That's what's scary.  I would love to have said to him, you can't talk to another man rationally under those moments.  Right, of course.  But I didn't know what the fuck she said to this guy.  I knew what happened.  I've never forced anybody in my life.  It doesn't turn me on.  It doesn't turn me on to make you do it.  It's the giving in. 
[00:32:30]  It's the tapping into that perversion part of you that turns me on.  So she obviously had some guilt after she left your hotel room.  My guess is that she felt guilty.  Right.  And she probably got drunk with him.  And my act was aggressive.  And she probably was like, and she just told him for whatever reason.  Right.  So now he pushes your arm away.  Yeah, and Kenny was right there.  So the guy walked away.  And the guy's like, what, do you need your bodyguard?  And I'm like, I don't even really know what's happening.  And then she comes over and she's like, that was not me today.  And I'm like, I didn't force you to do anything. 
[00:33:00]  I was nice to you.  And she's like, no, I know, I know.  Like, she did understand that I didn't force her to do anything.  But that's what fucking scares me.  So we went back.  I was so paranoid that night.  And I'm like, she might have told this guy I tried to assault her.  Of course.  She might have told this guy I grabbed her.  So I fucking, I was worried this guy's going to come back with a fucking shotgun.  Like, you don't know.  Right.  You don't know.  She might have said, he tried to rape me and I ran out.  Right.  So you got to be so fucking careful in these situations.  That's why I've never freaked out and yelled at anybody. 
[00:33:30]  Cause you never want them trying to, she confessed to this guy and felt guilty.  But, uh, she knew I didn't force her to do anything.  And she even said that to me.  She's like, no, no, I know, I know.  Um, and I talked to her once after that and she's like, nah, that was just a bad thing.  He's fine.  And, you know, and that was the end of it.  But, uh, I was very concerned and I see how people get fucking.  And again, this happened with a masseuse and people go, well, don't pick up the saw. 
[00:34:00]  But it could happen to anybody in any situation.  Um, I think most people accused of rape and stuff did it.  But I do understand how you could find yourself in a moment where somebody, thank God she didn't say something like that.  She was just guilty over what she did.  Hey, look, sorry.  You wanted 300 bucks.  Sorry.  Don't be mad at me.  I didn't fucking, don't feel coerced.  You're an adult.  You, you said, I'll never forget that.  She's like, well, well, how much do you give him?  And I immediately knew we had stepped over that line by that little question. 
[00:34:30]  Well, how much did they ask for?  Whatever it was she said.  So, um, you got to be really careful with this stuff.  And if he's doing this stuff.  He seems like he's untouchable.  That's.  Or he feels like he's untouchable.  He might feel like he's untouchable.  I, it seems like he doesn't give a fuck if people think he's gay.  It seems like.  I disagree.  I think he cares a lot about it.  You sure?  I think.  At this point.  Yeah, I think he's a sex addict.  And again, I've never met Travolta.  It's pure conjecture.  Right.  Is that opinion, conjecture? 
[00:35:00]  Uh, it's.  I understand what you're saying.  If that means anything.  I'm guessing.  But this, these strike me as the acts of a sex addict.  Um.  And, uh.  I feel bad for him in a way.  To have to live trapped like that.  He's, he's worth a hundred million easily.  Yeah.  I mean, financially, what's going to happen is.  Probably two to three hundred million.  Dude.  If you want to guess.  He has, the attorneys he has will tie this up in court for a long time.  Or they'll settle quietly.  But if it's found that he didn't do it, he's going to go after these guys with fucking Scientology lawyers. 
[00:35:30]  And those guys, Albert Brooks tweeted something really funny.  He goes, you think Scientology would have their own spot?  Which is a very, very funny fucking lie.  You would think.  They would have that all set up.  That's funny.  Well, we do have the transcript for the, uh, the second accuser.  It's, um.  We could get into after the break.  Yeah, should we eat first?  And, uh.  I think so.  That was scary though, dude.  That fuck, I've never talked about that.  That's years ago.  I don't know why I never did.  That sounds really creepy.  And I've given everybody all the details. 
[00:36:00]  There really is nothing I'm leaving out.  There's nothing.  Nah, you're, you're pretty damn honest on this show, Jimmy.  I have no doubt.  Nothing about my behavior that I'm, I'm, I'm softening or changing.  That really was what happened.  And it was very frightening because I realized in that moment, well, you connect, how vulnerable  you are.  And, and you connected, uh, to something in her that she was surprised by probably.  And then, and then after the fact, there was, it just seems like there was a lot of guilt  and she needed to fucking tell someone and she told her a guy there.  Yeah.  She was struggling with something. 
[00:36:30]  She did something for money.  She said, thank God we didn't fuck though.  Like I look back and I go, wow, that was, that was bad.  But the fact that she really didn't touch me, she just let me touch her ass a little  bit, which is kind of pathetic on my part to have done that.  But it was the high of getting a regular girl to do it.  But that's what happens to guys.  Sometimes you go home with somebody and, uh, I think Desiree Washington said that she  would not have gone to the police if Mike Tyson had walked her downstairs.  Right.  And I think that it was a combination.  I think she probably, she felt cheap. 
[00:37:00]  I think he probably, yeah, I think he probably forced it a little bit, but I don't think  he brutally fucking deserved to go to jail.  Right.  Looking back on it, I think that he probably was like, I can't, shut up.  I'll take care of you.  And you know how you get caught up in the moment.  Right.  And then he probably said, get out, bitch.  And she was just, she had to salvage her dignity somehow.  I don't, I don't even know why people would go to a massage schools with all this shit  going on out there where they want to go into like a career and, and take it,  extremely seriously.  And there's so many people trying to get more from a massage. 
[00:37:30]  What a nightmare that's got to be.  Spa massages are probably, these are both spa people too.  Right.  These are like masseur, masseur, like real guys.  Right.  And, uh, it's like Al Gore.  Well, how do you know it's a real, I don't know about the real guy.  Well, I was reading a little bit there saying the one guy used to work in a spa.  So I'm assuming that you have to have like your license to work in a spa.  Right.  Right.  Um, but when Gore got accused by that woman in that hotel, in Portland or something, I  believed her because he said things that I've said were very close to them, but he used 
[00:38:00]  really technical terms like other receptors, which are like right by your dick.  And, but whatever it was, he said, um, that went away, huh?  It sure did.  How did that go away?  I don't know.  How the fuck did that just go away?  You don't hear anything about that anymore.  He might've paid her off or it might still be tied up or maybe she's, maybe she didn't,  maybe she lied.  I don't know.  Right.  It was, uh, it was suspicious.  I remember reading through that whole thing.  So just trying to get jerked off and it's, it will be a nice day if we stop judging each 
[00:38:30]  other for stuff like that.  Like if you force a girl or a guy to do something, then you're kind of a piece of shit.  But if you're just out trying to get jerked off, why don't, I wish we lived in a place  where that was okay and you could go, yeah, I tried to.  And then people could go, well, I've done that too.  So I have nothing to say, but we're not that honest.  No, not at all.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to get into the John Travolta, um, transcript or whatever the case, the second  case, Travis saying not as good as the first, a little drop off in the sequel, but, uh, 
[00:39:00]  definitely some good stuff in here.  So we'll, uh, we'll do that.  Uh, I believe Tom Pop is joining us today.  We got anything else going on today?  Any guests?  I don't know.  I think just Tom Pop is the only guest.  Oh, good.  Tom Pop coming in a little later, I believe.  And, uh, there you go.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  You faded away now, huh? 
[00:39:30]  You rock in the house.  I'll do this one.  It's easy.  Billy Joel.  Happy fucking birthday.  63 today.  Happy birthday.  63 for Billy Joel.  Tom Pop in studio.  Good morning.  Hi, Tom.  Good to see you again.  Have you ever jerked off a guy?  Never.  All right.  Why do you ask?  We're going to talk about John Travolta in a second.  Oh.  I just want to bring you into the fold.  Mr. Kata.  Um, I guess you were drinking Jimmy's water last night at the cellar, you were telling 
[00:40:00]  me?  Jimmy and I were at the cellar last night, and he just looks like death.  Just like a sick guppy.  But why would you go out?  Stuff coming out of his eyes.  Yeah, yeah.  Just sitting at the table.  But why would you go out to the cellar?  Why don't you get some nice rest?  Because I've had a long couple of weeks.  I've got to work on new material now.  It's the special shot, so Travolta's happening.  I've got to start talking about that.  And the apnea.  But give it a week.  Nah.  I wanted to get out and start doing it, because I didn't go on it when I was in L.A.  That was my week of not performing.  Right. 
[00:40:30]  So now I want to go out.  And there's stuff that I did in the special that didn't make the final cut, because  it was too long.  So I want to try to weave that in.  And, you know, I don't want to just go out and do the same hour when people see me.  Some of it will be the same, but I mean, try to get enough new shit where it's  worth coming to see me.  You're a workaholic.  No, I just love it.  I sat down, and he's got fluids coming out of every orifice.  I'm just looking at him like, oh, poor Jimmy.  And we're talking for a little bit.  And by mistake, I grabbed his water and started gulping it down. 
[00:41:00]  And then I look over next to me.  I'm like, oh, that's my water.  I had taken like three giant gulps of his sick guppy water.  Backwise.  I went home.  I was just like scraping my tongue.  I was like putting napkins on it.  I'm like, how do I get it?  Just, we should have rinsed with like Listerine or alcohol.  And I would have done it?  A little bit, sure.  But he swallowed it.  He drank my fucking sick backwash.  It makes me very happy.  It's deep in my gut.  It's on my insides. 
[00:41:30]  He gargled out of my bedpan, Tom.  Really?  You know, why don't we have to fucking pop a sick next week?  Oh, it's so, I'm so, I started taking vitamin C.  Why are you here?  I don't know.  It's so gross right now.  Why are you here?  People are scared of the studio right now.  It smells sickly.  It does, right?  It really does.  It feels gross.  You know, I thought I was getting sick yesterday, then realized it's just a studio.  I went home and I feel fine.  And then I came back in today and it's like, it feels like it's in the air.  It's a Petri dish of disgust. 
[00:42:00]  I very rarely get, I'm fine.  Like I can work.  I mean, I felt bad yesterday.  I feel bad today, but I'll be okay.  Are you sneezing a lot?  No, no sneezing.  And I feel a cough beginning, of course, but that's just the natural process of this shit.  Right.  I had it.  I already had it.  Had what?  That, everyone's going around.  It's like this post-nasal drip and then it makes you cough and it wrecks your voice and  You had the gulps?  I had it.  I was in Denver.  I had to do two shows.  I had no voice.  What's worse than a sore throat that you've got to go on?  The worst?  You feel so vulnerable, don't you? 
[00:42:30]  Have you ever canceled a gig?  I don't think I've ever canceled.  Never.  Never.  I would right now.  You were close too, but the voice made it through.  Yeah.  I was just, you just, you feel like a little frightened rabbit because it's your only tool.  Don't you just want to be home though?  Like when you're on the road, especially it's like a Thursday and you got Thursday, Friday,  Saturday and there's like fucking half sold shows and you're like, oh, this stinks.  I just want to go home.  You just do your set and then just went back and just stayed in bed until the next show 
[00:43:00]  the next night.  I just, on the iPad, just going through.  I think I watched all of Walking Dead.  Right.  Half of Breaking Bad.  Right.  I just stayed there.  The worst is when you're afraid you're going to puke or shit.  So I throw it, you can work with.  Yeah.  When you feel like you're going to puke, man.  Yeah.  Opie was with me in San Francisco.  We were off the air and I was doing the punchline for the first time and I was on a non-sleep  bender.  Like I just wasn't sleeping and I was like three days without it and I was fucking loopy  and I was scared because I was in a new market and I was afraid. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  I had the shits.  And I feel like I was going to puke on it today.  That was, that's one of the worst weekends I've ever had.  Oh my God.  And I drove up from LA.  You did?  Yeah.  I was so bored.  Let's go see Jimmy.  You know, me and Jimmy keep in touch and he's like, yeah, I'm in San Francisco this  week.  And I'm like, well, that's kind of close, I guess.  It's in the same state.  It's a long state.  I learned the hard way it's a long state.  I'm like, California, how bad could it be? 
[00:44:00]  LA, San Francisco, San Diego.  But that Pacific Coast Highway, I highly recommend it.  Everyone fucking drives it one time.  Put that on your dumb bucket list.  You remember Dallas?  That's an amazing ride.  It's amazing.  Which Dallas trip?  Yeah, he came, Opie came a couple of times, the first one where the black curtain was  drawn and Opie was trying to be positive because we were getting, we were off the air.  See, Sam, see, no one knows this part of me.  That's what I'm obsessing about lately.  See?  What do you mean?  Everyone thinks I'm just a complete asshole and that's all I got at me.  No, you were trying to be, uh, you were trying to be positive and it was a small crowd, 
[00:44:30]  but you're like, you know, it's your first time here.  Yeah, I'm having, I'm having some thoughts lately.  I really am.  What, you were, you were.  Because the, because the nice stuff doesn't translate well on the show, but did you hear  what Jimmy just said?  Yeah, but you got it.  He's all concerned about the black curtain and I'm sitting there trying to fucking spin  that shit.  That's true, but I didn't, I didn't.  What did I say, though?  I don't remember exactly.  It was just your attitude about being, hey, man, no big deal and we'll have fun.  But that's what you got to do.  You got to be nice more often and then not point it out every time you're nice.  That's true.  But it's boring for the show.  But you can't make an announcement every time you do something nice. 
[00:45:00]  How about I do a nice show?  And you do things to cancel it out.  Like, San Francisco was fun, but we were on the air and we were on the Alice show with  Sarah and No Name, who I like both.  They broke, they split, but they're still both doing radio out there.  They were, they were all right.  Yeah, they were good fans of the show.  We were on the air and Ope hadn't been on the air at all.  He wasn't allowed.  So he would come in and he's just hanging in the studio.  And I did some, it was my first time on the show and I did some joke that bombed and  Ope was like, that was funny. 
[00:45:30]  Like, that's all he said.  Why would I do that?  I was so mad.  Were you mad at me?  Yeah, I was, because I was, I was embarrassed.  Not because it was like, I didn't know them.  And that was a weird tone show.  Right.  Like, I know those guys now.  Right.  But back then, they weren't like laugh out loud people.  But they were enjoying it.  But I was like, oh my God, I'm bombing.  And he just called me out, I'm bombing.  And I'm not going to.  So, but I told you about it.  You said, it was no big deal.  And you, you, you.  I didn't.  That wasn't my intention.  No, but you were like, oh, sorry, man.  And it was like, oh, it's cool. 
[00:46:00]  And that was kind of it.  I just wasn't sleeping.  I like how you're like, I can apologize again if you like.  No.  I know it was my intention.  I haven't thought about that.  I would never try to sabotage your shit.  No, I think you said that too.  But I think I was just so like, like anxious to do any type of radio.  You were just being you and having fun.  And yeah, no, I get that.  All right.  Sorry.  Jesus Christ.  I'm not mad about it.  See, Sam.  See?  I could say sorry.  Yeah, but.  But you don't need to.  I'm not angry.  I just remembered it.  I like how your Gandhi-like moment of kindness is telling Jim to cheer up that his show's half 
[00:46:30]  full.  That really is true.  It's such a kind heart.  It's the same way you would talk to a Little League kid.  Right.  You get him next time, bucko.  We had a good time down there.  I like Dallas.  Yeah, it was fun, right?  What a weird market.  I know.  Yeah, Dallas is weird.  We did that a couple times.  I've said it many times, that the women all have fake boobs and guns.  And they leave their guns in the glove compartment and go into these bars and stuff.  We talked to them.  They're like, oh yeah, I got a gun in the car.  Yeah.  They're hot. 
[00:47:00]  Everyone's divorced.  Yeah, it's a weird place.  Yeah.  It is weird.  And they really have that thing.  It's like, you're like, well, you know, in the South, we ain't the South.  We ain't the South.  We ain't the North.  We ain't America.  We're Texas.  Oh, they're their own country.  We are Texas.  And Dallas is the balls of it.  Well, they want to be their own country.  That comes up from time to time.  Oh, completely.  I think eventually they'll figure it out, too.  Yeah, they're not messing around.  No, they're not fucking around, man.  No.  Even Rick Perry, before he ran, was saying they should secede. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  You know, I've kind of had enough of certain states.  Let them go.  North Carolina, banning gay marriages.  I've been so fucking annoyed for the last 12 hours.  I know.  When did that happen?  Yesterday.  Oh, I didn't know that.  And the voice of the people spoke.  Fuck the people.  It's not what it's about, because the majority doesn't, like, the majority is just fucking  telling the minority how to live.  Fuck yourself.  Right.  Exactly.  The majority in Alabama in the 50s had their opinion of who counted.  When is the last time any group, and this is what I'll believe the majority means so, when 
[00:48:00]  is the last time any group said, you should be able to do something, but I shouldn't?  Never in the history of this country has one person said, you should do it.  It's always, here's why I should be able to do it.  Right.  And here's why it's not right for you.  Right.  Never has anybody fought to have their own ability to do something taken away.  Right.  It's fucking fraudulent.  Yeah.  It absolutely is.  Bunch of phonies Americans.  It really is fucking annoying me.  We're telling the whole world how to live, and women, and blacks, and gays, and everybody 
[00:48:30]  has to fight for what is supposed to be your God-given right.  Right.  Life, what is it?  Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.  Right.  Yeah.  It's a lie.  You know what?  And I think, yeah, me, you, and Ann all support the gays on this show.  We do.  And I want to use this moment to talk about the Boy Butter thing.  Yeah.  They think we're not, we don't support the gays.  Their advertising was way the fuck over the top. 
[00:49:00]  What was it like?  So I said, I don't want Boy Butter on our fucking show advertising.  So the one guy's writing blogs and trying to make something of it.  Oh, really?  If you listen to this show, it's very obvious we support the gays.  Yeah.  We really do.  Yeah.  But their ads are not even trying to be subtle.  They're over the fucking top.  What is it?  So I went to these guys and said, whoa, you know, because we're trying to fucking up our  game a little bit.  Uh-huh.  You know, and it's not subtle. 
[00:49:30]  Their advertising wasn't even close to subtle.  That's such a sleazy thing to do.  Close to subtle.  I still felt we should have done something great with that.  Like, we literally should have made guys do live reads for Boy Butter.  We should have brought our guys in and made them.  Right.  Made them do live reads.  Right.  And made them write things about how Boy Butter could help their lives.  See, look.  There's a whole article on us.  It's got Boy Butter.  You know, and I just wanted the...  Oh, God.  And to be honest, I just wanted the discussion.  You know, the guys behind the scenes chose to yank it off the air right away because they 
[00:50:00]  weren't even aware that they were advertising on our show.  I think he likes the show this guy.  I just wanted people to take a look at it.  That's all.  I think this guy likes the show.  But don't say we don't support, you know, gay marriage and all that shit because we do.  Don't use it as a weapon.  No, please don't.  I didn't even read the article, to be honest with you.  It's not that bad.  We should...  A few people have, you know, let me in on some of the things.  I think he'd come back to the show, and I think that we should...  Maybe we could work it out, but I just...  Something about it didn't seem right at the time.  Oh, boy. 
[00:50:30]  You know what's frustrating?  We've been talking lately about getting beer companies and stuff, and then this just kind  of came at a time where it was like, ugh, another sex lube.  Right.  It wasn't even about...  It was almost like we can't get...  We don't expect, you know, fucking General Mills to advertise, but we can't get beer companies.  We've been kind of complaining about that for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you see, like, all right, it's another sex lube.  Like, is that all we can get is sex lubes?  It's just be...  It was kind of a point of frustration.  Yeah, no.  It just happened to be them.  For whoever this guy is, Jimmy's absolutely right.  It was an opportunity to beat the shit out of the sales staff around here, because I don't 
[00:51:00]  think they do a very good job.  No, it's the same thing.  I have my show over on Raw Dog, and all they were coming to me with was male enhancement  stuff.  Right.  Really bad versions of it.  Right.  And I was like, no, you know, I'd rather not have it than just my show.  It seems like that show is only sponsored by guys hard on it.  That's all I was trying to say, because when you hear, you know, ad after ad about, you  know, we had one where, you know, take this product and your cum tastes better.  Right.  It's like, you know, after a while, you're like, well, what, can you find another advertiser 
[00:51:30]  besides these type of things?  Is that when Jimmy's water?  That's all...  No, but it's true.  That's all we were getting at.  No, because if you have, you're dominated by a certain advertiser, then you kind of  are that show.  Right.  You would just be like a pure sex show.  And people, especially like new listeners who want to try you guys out, they would think,  oh, that's just what they do.  And it's not.  No, we're way more than that.  And, you know, I could, we could easily work a boy butter ad into our ads if we just had 
[00:52:00]  other shit.  Yeah, I know.  It's annoying.  It's really annoying.  And we're not being, nothing's going to come of this as bad.  It literally...  Yeah, but I want this guy to know whoever he is, you know, he's got to understand the  show.  We absolutely support, you know, the gay lifestyle and gay marriage and all that.  It was just, I guess we hit our breaking point.  Well...  And got a little frustrated that day.  And all I wanted, I'll say it again, is just a discussion with the people behind the  scenes about it. 
[00:52:30]  I didn't insist that it was yanked.  I said, whoa, what is this about it?  And then they, they didn't really know.  Right.  It was snuck past them.  That's all.  So that's where we're at with that.  Now, if they come...  The advertising thing here is a little weird.  It's a little weird.  A little weird.  If they come back to the show, we should figure out a way to have certain people do certain  reads that make them uncomfortable.  Like a fist up their ass.  Please, there's nothing I want more than one of these guys...  Yeah, taking a fist up their ass.  ...to write a homoerotic...  Let's see how good this boy butter is. 
[00:53:00]  I want E-Rock or Sam...  Sam.  Definitely Sam.  I want these guys to write very sexually charged ads in support of boy butter.  Yeah.  I think that's what we should do.  Write down their fantasies and then tie it into boy butter.  They should do a minute on...  But only on how they would...  On whatever the things on the website are.  I don't understand the fist up the ass thing.  What don't you get?  I don't know why...  I don't know why you'd want...  It's not hard to figure out.  It's ouch.  But I don't know why you'd want to do that to your body. 
[00:53:30]  Women like it in their pussies too, man.  It's crazy.  That's fucking bizarre.  Yeah.  To need to be stra...  I take her finger.  I literally...  I want to get fucked with a strap on because it's so dirty.  Never going to happen.  Right.  I was talking to my ex last night and I sent her a picture of me in a dress and she's  just like...  It makes me uncomfortable.  It makes me want to fuck you with a strap on.  Why were you in a dress?  Yeah, maybe a bit that I did recently for tonight's show.  Oh, I'm behind.  No, no, no.  It didn't air.  Okay, you scared me.  But I'd say, I wish I could take that kind of pain.  I just can't.  I can't take it.  I swear to God, I got a finger. 
[00:54:00]  I'm like, I got a shit.  I wish I didn't.  When did we get to see you in a dress?  17th, I'm doing Leno again.  Nice.  Very good.  I was asking Jimmy for...  You know, because I'm married, so my cell phone is filled with like Build-A-Bear parties  and stuff like that.  I was asking Jimmy, like, how do you get girls to send you pictures of themselves naked?  Well, there's got to be a strategy behind it.  And he gave me his whole strategy.  Then I went home and watched Girls on HBO.  And that was the lead thing.  The issue was sharing stuff. 
[00:54:30]  The guy sent his penis to a girl.  People are raving about Girls on HBO.  Raving about it.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  It's definitely pretty good.  The girl that writes, it's 25.  Wow.  She created it and wrote it.  Yeah, I've seen a couple of...  But I always had the thing of like a penis that just seems like such a sad thing on its  own.  No.  It doesn't have a close-up shot of it.  I don't know why girls are attracted by the penis.  It's so awful.  It looks like something's hurt.  Yeah.  And I try to keep mine nice, but it's just like...  You can't.  It's like, fuck, really? 
[00:55:00]  You guys...  I don't understand why you would be attracted by this shit.  Especially a close-up shot on your phone.  Oh, my God.  It depends.  You've got to get a good shot.  You've got to get a good shot that makes your hog look fucking delicious and appealing.  It doesn't even look like it belongs on your body.  No, it doesn't.  Like a girl's pussy.  It looks like it belongs.  It's just like, what is this?  It looks like a growth.  Right.  It is.  Like a weird growth.  But Jimmy has a nice...  Jimmy gets a lot of nice cell phone action. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Like you're growing a horseradish.  You ever see the horseradish root?  It's a gourd.  It's a gourd.  It's a gourd.  It's a gourd on our body.  It's a Halloween gourd just sticking out of you.  I don't understand why you would look at that and go, wow, I need that.  Oh, boy.  I need that.  I don't understand.  I know.  I was saying to Jimmy, I don't think that my wife would appreciate me sending it to her.  You know?  Or the other girls.  Right.  And it's true. 
[00:56:00]  There's just something about it.  It's just like, all right.  That's because you guys are married.  They're like, you know each other's...  Like, part of the high is when before you fool around or whatever, it's...  What a gasp.  No, I understand the turn-on of all that stuff.  Of course.  I completely understand.  What?  Of sharing photos?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah.  A little dirty and naughty and...  Well, yeah.  I'm just saying I don't understand how girls are turned-on of by the penis.  Unless...  And I can get it if it's like attached to the guy. 
[00:56:30]  Like, if you see a picture of the guy and it seems like something and you see it, then  it's in context.  Okay.  But out of context, just close up.  Yeah.  It just seems like roadkill.  I have a picture of myself from years ago.  Sorry.  With my hands on my hips in front of my curtain.  With my heart on.  I was thinner then.  It's a really good picture.  I look like Superman.  You really like that one.  Yeah.  It's a fucking home run.  Yeah.  That, see, like in context, it seems like that would work.  No face, though.  No face.  No.  And the hard-on...  The hard-on cuts down on a lot of activities. 
[00:57:00]  What do you mean?  There's a lot of things you just can't do with the hard-on.  Like P?  P.  How about just jump?  Jump.  How about we start there?  Why are you jumping with a hard-on?  You really can't go about life with a hard-on.  No, you can't.  Can you Google image the horseradish?  Horseradish.  We used to grow the horseradish in our backyard when we were trying to save a few bucks on  vegetables.  Hey, Dad, does that look like...  Yes, it does, son.  That one. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Do I know my horseradish?  You're really good.  That's exactly it.  There you go.  If I was a girl and that came out of my cell phone, I'd be upset.  That looks like a penis with every STD in my hand.  It really does.  See?  That's what we got on our bodies, basically.  It needs a wire brush.  But it's delicious.  Yum, yum.  Horseradish is delicious when you grow it.  Yum, yum.  I don't know why we wasted valuable space in our backyard for horseradish, but we did. 
[00:58:00]  That's good stuff.  Yeah.  We had to plant the fields.  Did you make a lot of Bloody Marys?  No.  As a kid, they got the bright idea if we grow our own vegetables, they could save a few  bucks.  So they took away our wiffle ball field.  And we had a fucking plow with our bikes.  Are you serious?  You've never heard this story?  No.  We get brand new bikes.  We were all psyched.  My dad gets the idea.  You put a two-by-four between the two bikes.  You could flatten out the field.  Oh, God.  And we had a plant shit, and our vegetables sucked. 
[00:58:30]  They all looked sickly.  And for a summer or two, we couldn't play our wiffle ball, because that was our fucking  wiffle ball field.  You're like convicts.  We were.  You're like...  We were.  What a chain gang.  There was a time...  Well, I mean, in all fairness to my mom, I'm one of seven, and we're all literally a year  apart.  Wow.  A year to 14 months apart.  One after another, she had these kids because of the Catholic faith.  You need food.  She's openly admitted she never wanted to have all of us, which is really nice. 
[00:59:00]  But your father wouldn't stop climbing on me.  I was her first birth, so I know I'm good.  But I feel bad for my younger siblings.  Number five.  She openly will admit it at parties.  I'm like, why don't you chill out?  They're right there.  After two glasses of wine.  Right.  So the last two, definitely, she didn't want, and possibly the last three.  I never wanted any.  Oh, my God.  Does she get like that?  Like, after a couple of glasses of wine?  Ah, no.  I don't know.  I don't want anybody.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[00:59:30]  We could do a whole show on my mom.  I don't feel like doing it today.  So you had to plow the fields?  Well, no.  They would give us busy work.  How big a thing was it?  What do you mean?  How big a plot?  Farm.  How would I explain it?  It was a football field?  Half a field?  No, no.  Nothing like that.  A little square.  Probably 20 yards by 40 yards.  Yeah, okay.  I don't know acres.  Right.  Is that like a quarter acre, maybe?  Yeah.  Around there?  Yeah.  I'm thinking maybe a quarter acre.  Right.  That sounds about right. 
[01:00:00]  But the whole fucking thing.  And people remind, the concrete lunch bags.  See, these are all stories I've told a million times.  Right.  My mom wouldn't even splurge for sandwich bags.  So whatever bag was in the house, that's how we had to go to school with our lunch.  And it got so bad because we did a lot of cement work that, and I swear to you, that we actually  brought our lunch into school in cement bags.  I swear to God.  Not all the time. 
[01:00:30]  Not a regular thing.  But when it really got low on the bags she was collecting.  Blowing dust off your bologna sandwich.  And the reason why we had cement bags was because there was a period of time there where she couldn't  take it anymore.  So my dad stepped in and gave us busy work around the house, so we did a lot of cement  work as kids.  And if you see, you know what?  I'm going to go to my old house, and I'm going to finally take pictures of all the cement  work.  I know people don't believe me.  It's got to be fun.  And there's paths that go to nowhere. 
[01:01:00]  Just concrete.  Yeah.  We started steps that went up into the backwoods, but then it leads to nowhere.  It's either an unfinished project, or my dad had no intention of having something  that made sense.  Sometimes fathers would just see you sitting down watching TV and just be like, come up  with something.  Right.  My dad, we had woods in the back, and he'd be like, go out there and pick up sticks.  Sticks?  It's like sticks.  It's woods.  There's sticks everywhere.  There's no beginning or end to this job.  Go get sticks. 
[01:01:30]  Go pick up sticks.  We had to get sticks because we had a wood-burning stove.  They refused to turn on the heat.  Oh, God.  So we had to supply the wood.  And then when we couldn't find wood, we had to make paper logs.  It's like Abraham Lincoln.  I don't want to do this again, Sam.  I like it.  I don't want to do it again.  It's like Abraham Lincoln.  I'm not joking.  There was a thing.  Maybe you can find it online.  I don't even want to see this thing because it's in my nightmares, but it would actually  roll paper really, really tight.  Uh-huh.  And you'd make paper logs. 
[01:02:00]  And then you had to put wire around the paper logs so they don't fall apart.  And that's how we were heating our home for many years.  Oh, my God.  They refused to turn the heat on.  You're like the Lincolns.  And then when it got really cold, when we used to have real winters, I don't know what  the fuck that's about, we would literally sleep around the wood-burning stove because  we were so fucking cold.  Please, Father, can I have some more?  There it is.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So we'd collect the papers.  That's pretty cool.  And we'd have to roll them up tight into paper logs.  All that stuff seems cool unless you have to do it. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know what, as a kid, it was really cool, the first one you made, but when you're up  to making $1,000 to $2,000, guess what, Tom?  It's not cool anymore.  Other kids are using newspapers for silly putty.  Right.  Oh, God, no.  And then my dad would round us up, and he goes, hey, we're going to play a game today.  It's like, cool.  He'd find some crazy woods, pull up the Volkswagen bus with no seats so we could get more people  in there.  That's awesome.  And then he'd go, hey, why don't you guys run around up there and play war and collect 
[01:03:00]  rocks?  For what?  He got obsessed with rock walls.  Oh, no.  Because I think he wanted to stay away from my mom, too.  So we collected the rocks, we had to make the cement, and we made rock walls all over  the place.  You're like...  I'm not joking.  Flintstones.  Yeah.  I'm going to take pictures of all this.  I'd love to see it.  You'll be amazed how many rocks and how many rock walls we have.  All dirty kids.  Yeah.  Covered in dirt and rock debris. 
[01:03:30]  But in all fairness, I don't blame my mom.  Because I have one kid I can't imagine having.  I can't imagine having seven.  It's so insane.  I mean, my sister is a bit older because she's from my dad's first marriage.  But then it's me, my brother, all the way down.  And we're one year apart right down to the end.  Six kids in six years.  I saw a woman yesterday at the school with five kids.  Really?  And she's like, you know, bringing her kid in for the talent show.  And she's taking care of all the other ones.  She's got one on her.  She's got a baby on her.  The other thing. 
[01:04:00]  And it just...  It looks just...  How do you function?  They must have nervous breakdowns.  How many you got?  Two?  Two.  I hear that's good because you both could guard them.  It's good and they can play with each other.  There comes this moment where all of a sudden they just don't want to talk to you.  And they just run off by themselves.  You're like, oh, they have a friend.  But my brother explains one is great.  Yeah.  Two, it's man-on-man coverage.  You take one.  Your wife takes one.  He goes, three is when it's a nightmare.  Because now you're playing zone. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  That's how he explains it.  Yeah.  Because now you're fucking playing zone.  Yeah.  No, I would not be into it.  What do you laugh at?  What do you get?  Do you get something good, Jimmy?  Just a mean tweet to Mamish Mamillard.  Why is it mean?  Why are these people so mean?  I just asked before I Twittered about trying the fucking mouth guard.  And Turk February 22 says, an easy way to know if it will fit is to put the barrel of a shotgun in your mouth.  That'll get rid of your apnea piggy boy.  I don't see that as a mean tweet, though.  I understand the difference. 
[01:05:00]  I really do.  It's fine.  Anyway.  Growing up in the woods.  Yeah, we had a weird upbringing.  I want to do a podcast with my brothers badly.  Oh, yeah.  A short-lived series, obviously.  We'd run out of shit.  But when we get going and tell these stories, they're just amazing.  It is amazing.  Are both your parents still around?  No.  No.  Oh, Tom.  Which one's left?  Oh, Tom.  The bad one. 
[01:05:30]  No.  I wish it was the other way around.  Really?  I want to be honest.  That's great that you just said that.  We all wish that.  Really?  We wish my dad would have had a few years of peace.  Oh.  It didn't work out because there's no God.  Oh.  There really isn't.  My dad.  Come on, boys.  Let's go get some rocks.  My dad was beyond the nicest guy you would ever meet.  Really?  Never raised his voice like me or any of that shit.  With seven kids, never raised his voice. 
[01:06:00]  Sacrificed his own life for his wife and his kids.  Wow.  He did everything right.  Ugh.  And he goes out in a horrific car accident.  Ugh.  And the weird thing is the car hit where my mom was sitting.  She survived.  I was like RoboCop.  And you prefer it would have been reversed?  If you want some honesty, it would have been in a perfect world.  It would have been nice.  Yeah.  Give him some, let him chill for a while.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, we just wanted him to have a few years of chill.  Yeah.  I would have absolutely set him up with some girls.  You bring him over to his rock quarry.  Does she just have no ability to see how she affects people?  Some people just don't.  They have no ability to see how they affect other people.  Yeah.  I guess that's all we would ever need from her.  We understand she's sick and has a disease and all that shit, but yeah, that would make  it a lot easier.  Yeah.  If she realized what effects she's had on everybody.  The disease OCD?  Well, I think it's way more than that. 
[01:07:00]  Manic depressive.  But that's what we label it as, OCD.  There's some other shit going on in there.  Yeah.  We have someone like that in our family.  Yeah.  Isn't it fun, Tom?  It's totally selfish.  Brings down the whole fucking family, doesn't it?  It is totally selfish.  Yeah.  Complete selfish.  It's literally...  It's all about them.  The whole world is about them.  They literally are the sun in your family, meaning the thing in the sky.  The thing in the sky.  And everyone else has to rotate around it.  And it burns you.  You can't really look at it.  It's just awful.  You just want to really just take them out.  Is this person OCD, or are they kind of depressive? 
[01:07:30]  I think they're depressed.  I think they're, like, bipolar.  Because they'll go from, like, kind of happy, like, kind of giddy, and then really dark, and  then just, like, blow up out of nowhere.  Are they nice people?  No.  You know what?  There are times when she's nice, but there's a lot of times where she's just...  Who is she?  No.  You don't want to say?  I don't want to say, because people know my mother-in-law.  Well, a lot of people know my mom.  You hear what I just said? 
[01:08:00]  Do you hear what I just said?  She's awful.  And everybody, like, you know, tries and tries, and they try, and just tears things down.  But I really think that...  Does your wife know that?  I mean, she knows that, but, I mean, does she feel that?  Oh, completely.  Oh, she does.  Completely.  She gets annoyed by it?  Yeah.  I mean, abusive, nasty stuff all the time.  How do you handle it?  Do you just...  I've always felt people like that, the way to do it is to...  The only thing I can do to hurt them is to remove myself completely from their selfish 
[01:08:30]  life.  No, that doesn't hurt them.  No, but...  Or, okay, just to give me...  That absolutely doesn't hurt them.  That's what you learn, that they don't even know the difference when you do that.  I had to separate from my mom, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  I have a very, very basic relationship with her.  Yeah.  I mean, the bare minimum.  I had to.  Yeah, that's healthy.  I had to, because...  You have to do that, because...  I got a kid now, and a wife, and I'm happy, and I don't want that shit poisoned.  My whole life was poisoned by shit.  They're toxic.  They're toxic people.  So you get it.  And you're around them, and you get the toxicity. 
[01:09:00]  It really stares you down.  Yeah, but then, like, you know, but this...  I mean, weird stuff, you know?  And as the...  Because it's not my mother, because it's not mine, I have to...  Stuff will come up, and I just want to attack, but you can't.  Sure.  I just kind of have to disengage and be like, well...  Have you argued with her?  She's great.  She's funny sometimes.  Have you argued with her?  No, I do what you do.  I get really cold and just walk away. 
[01:09:30]  It's either...  It's got to be this or this.  Wow.  And it's usually women.  Yeah.  It's one of those two?  Oh, no, I said it's my mother-in-law.  Oh, you did say that.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't listening.  A mom-in-law.  Oh, I'm a dick.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  And, yeah, I mean, just...  What's really upsetting is that you watch what she's doing to my wife. 
[01:10:00]  You know what I mean?  You watch what...  Oh, God, you should talk to my wife.  You watch that.  You guys have a lot in common.  And you're like, you know, you love this person, and you see what...  Yeah.  It's like, why are you so fucked up?  Why are you shut your mouth?  She's so much better than you are.  Do you tell your wife, like, why do you communicate with her?  Or does she...  You guys, you have to a little bit, right?  You have to.  You know, it's the parent thing, and it's...  Yeah, in the end, you're going, oh, fuck, it is your mom.  And there is, like, sweet...  It's tough.  Yeah, there are some moments.  There's sweet moments, right?  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah, and then that's poisoned by the next dumb thing. 
[01:10:30]  And then...  We should go out to dinner.  You want to do a double date?  Yeah, let's do it.  I'm not even joking.  Let's do it.  It would be amazing, because you're describing a lot of shit that...  Oh, it's...  We deal with in my house.  Oh, it's amazing.  Not as much, though.  But you're able to...  You're able to...  Did she separate?  No.  She's still all in?  All around, all in.  Trying to reason and all that crap?  And making excuses for her, you know...  Are you in the other room while the phone calls are going on, and then her whole mood  changes after she gets off the phone?  Yeah, it's just...  It's like, so how was it? 
[01:11:00]  Like, they're going to spend the day together.  So how was it?  It was really good.  Until she said that I was a total failure.  Oh, great.  You know what I mean?  That kind of stuff.  You know how Jimmy, the last few days, has been talking about how great my wedding was?  The only person that didn't like my wedding was my mom.  Isn't that wonderful?  Oh, really?  Killed me for it.  Isn't that unusual?  Because I didn't want her to sit at my table.  And I told her why.  Because I didn't want my special day that I have truly been waiting for my entire life,  and I finally fucking figured some shit out. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  I didn't want her to ruin it with her bullshit.  Yeah.  Because she cannot help herself.  So I put her at a table right next to me.  And did that resonate with her at all when you said that to her when you told her?  No.  No, not at all.  What did she say?  She was the only one that didn't like my wedding.  How wonderful is that?  It's exactly...  I'm sure...  You know what?  I'm sure other people didn't like my wedding.  No.  I bet you the odds are there were probably a few other people in there, maybe.  No.  But guess what?  They don't fucking express that to you because they didn't realize how big of a day it is  for you.  The problem is, it was your day, it was your special event for you, and it has nothing 
[01:12:00]  to do with her, so she twists it and makes it about her.  It's extreme narcissism.  Yeah, I mean, because mine did the same thing.  We had this little small ceremony, and it became this thing about the cake, that she  doesn't like a certain kind of cake, and we had to make sure that she had this kind  of a special little cupcake on the side.  All of a sudden, the whole thing is about this crazy person sitting at the table, fucking 
[01:12:30]  miserable.  Miserable.  When we said we were having a baby, our first one, the reaction was, you know, we ever see  nature shows when you see a mom gorilla, and all of a sudden, she's pushing her kids aside.  It's like a mutation in nature.  Yeah.  It was like that.  Wow.  What'd she do?  Just like, she had this nice dinner out, this special kind of a thing, and we tell them, 
[01:13:00]  a big announcement.  We just did it with my family, where people are exploding and crying and jumping up and  down.  We tell them, we're having our first, drops her fork, sticks her tongue out, and like  left the table.  Why?  Why?  Why?  And I know why, because I've lived this life.  What was the reason for not being happy for a married couple?  Because her life is miserable, and she's unhappy with every choice that she made, and that  includes getting married, having kids, all that stuff, and sees mine doing the same thing, 
[01:13:30]  and it's just like, she's miserable about her own life.  And she doesn't understand that yours is actually happy, and made choices she wanted to make.  Exactly.  And didn't make a mistake by marrying you, and didn't...  Exactly.  It's not trapped by having a kid, it was wanting to have a kid.  It's a huge difference.  A huge difference.  Yeah, my mom has...  They always make it about them.  Not much of a connection with any of her grandkids.  Not much at all.  And then she gets jealous, because I go down to Philly a lot.  And I'm like, well, because they're like fucking normal, and they love my son, and they 
[01:14:00]  actually get gifts for him, and things like that.  You know, like normal shit.  Right, with like drive up, just to like...  I don't know if I've ever told...  I hate...  I get uncomfortable telling these stories, because it's like, let her just be.  But she stopped seeing my brother's kids when they were...  I'm trying to think.  They were probably six and five at the time.  It's a long ride.  She stopped going, and her reason was, they don't acknowledge her. 
[01:14:30]  In the middle of the car ride?  She finally said, we're not going out there anymore, because the kids don't acknowledge  us.  Now, without giving too much away, my brother's kids are very shy.  They're just shy.  They're shy kids.  Everyone knows that.  So you try to work around that.  You try to get an open and shit like that.  Especially at six or five.  They're much better now, because they're older.  But like, she can't even comprehend that's what's going on there. 
[01:15:00]  To look at a five and a six-year-old and judge them like two adults.  But she's like, we're not going to take that long ride anymore, because they don't acknowledge  us.  And she would always talk to my father, and I think my father would get stuck in some  of those situations.  About a five-year-old.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Not a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Like, she wanted respect from the kids, and for them to come running up, and giving her  the big hug and kiss, and blah, blah, blah.  It's six and five.  It's like, and then, it's not even worth getting into, because she never will see it 
[01:15:30]  any other way.  Like, but you don't even put in the effort or the time to have a relationship.  When was the last time you went out there just to see one of their stupid baseball games,  or whatever the fuck they're into?  It's such a, it's so natural.  It's in the natural course of the world to be around your grandchildren.  Just seeing their faces fills your life.  Sure.  It makes you, you're filled with love and positivity. 
[01:16:00]  Even if the kid doesn't even, even if the kid doesn't really kiss you, and he's just over  there, it just is a natural thing.  Right.  And when they act like that, it goes against nature.  I mean, it goes against.  Yeah.  I was just reminded of something else, too.  She had this close friend.  This goes back years.  A lot of these stories go back years, because I'm pretty much out.  Yeah.  And I asked her about her friend.  She goes, oh, God.  I don't hang out with her as much, because all she talks about is her grandkids, blah, 
[01:16:30]  blah, blah.  This kid implies game in his recital, the grandkids, blah, that's all she talks about.  I'm on your mom's side on this one.  But you're not an adult with grandkids yourself.  That's what I'm looking at.  I'm like, holy fuck.  You get to that age, and guess what?  A lot of people in your age bracket, they love grandkids.  Right.  Exactly.  But would go on and on.  Enough with the grandkids. 
[01:17:00]  It's because they're not getting attention, because it's not about them, and they'll do  anything positive or negative to make it come back to them.  It's selfish.  I love cutting an extreme narcissist out.  I love it.  Even if they don't notice it, it feels so good to be rid of them.  Yeah.  Oh, I love cutting them out.  And whether they know it or not, it's just so nice to not have their fucking awful, shitty.  And they do notice it, unless they're totally crazy. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  But most people do notice when you're totally disconnected from them, you don't return calls,  you don't call them.  Yeah.  I love not asking their opinion.  Love it.  It really is great.  Because you can feel it.  You can feel it.  Yeah, she can't.  She can't get a hold of me, which is great.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  Good for you.  It's healthy.  I got a house phone that I basically told my brothers and sisters, you give this number  to her, I'll fucking kill you.  Wow.  No joke.  Did they disconnect too?  Not really.  No.  I went through a lot.  I went through, well, I still do therapy and stuff. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  So I was able to figure some shit out.  It's a heavy thing.  To figure it out.  It's very complicated.  And after my wedding, because she's not even brave enough to do it to my face, she left  these horrendous voicemails about my wedding.  Horrendous.  I wish I saved them.  I would so play them on the air.  Wow.  But I deleted them quickly.  Yeah.  Because it was just like, it goes right to your fucking soul.  She was mad about the seating, right?  Yeah.  I left her out there like a dog, even though I put her at a table with her friends right  next to my table. 
[01:18:30]  And I made sure she was having a good time.  And the fact is, none of my siblings want to sit with her either.  So they were sitting at their own fucking table.  But that was their request to me.  I enjoy your wedding.  Right.  They went to Philly, so it was a weekend for them and stuff.  Well, that's the thing, too.  They, it's all that kind of stuff.  Like all your siblings saying, no, get me.  It's a result of all their past actions.  And they act that way.  Right.  And they repel everybody.  And then they wonder why they're alone and miserable.  Yep. 
[01:19:00]  The only thing to do is everyone's to tell them, look, you self-centered person.  We hate your guts.  And walk away.  And then they are, and this is with any person.  Yeah.  It's harder with a mom, I'm sure.  Yeah.  But to leave them alone.  Yeah.  For real.  Right.  Never answer their calls.  Yeah.  Then they will understand on some level.  Will they, though?  No.  Maybe not.  No.  Why don't they blame you?  No.  Let them.  No.  Let them.  It's irrelevant.  It's valueless.  I've been playing this game my entire life.  They just don't understand. 
[01:19:30]  They're not even inkling.  It's amazing.  Amazing.  But just to finish the phone thing, I got a cell phone.  Mm-hmm.  You cannot leave a voicemail.  Oh, really?  And that started at my wedding.  Three and a half years ago.  Really?  But with the technology, it's cool that you know who called.  Mm-hmm.  You don't really need a fucking message anyway.  But that's so she can't leave any messages.  Did she stop trying at a certain point?  No, she'll call.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she goes, and you know, when I see her every once in a while, she goes, yeah, your  voicemail's not set up.  Oh, yeah, you know.  I should tell her why.  True.  I think I did tell her why one time. 
[01:20:00]  Wow.  It's so difficult.  I think she forgot.  It's a, I mean, I watch.  It's really not difficult anymore.  No.  No, it really isn't.  That's good.  Hope your wife gets to that place.  Yeah.  Because my wife would see me being in a horrendous mood as soon as I got off the phone with her,  and it would last for like a day or two.  Just a black cloud.  A black cloud?  You're doing your, you're going about your life.  You're, you're, you're figuring stuff out.  You know, it's a person's life is a very fragile house of cars.  Right.  And you're trying to build it.  And then this person comes along and just knocks it over just for fun. 
[01:20:30]  So when she dropped that like fork or whatever and walked away from the table, what was the  resolution that night?  Like how did the rest of that night play out?  No, I, I got the car and we split.  Oh, good for you.  It was just, I was so mortified.  Because what she wanted was, she wanted everyone to follow her.  I was so, and we just told you, this isn't like we're buying a, we're buying a Chevy.  What do you think?  This is growing inside my wife.  Right. 
[01:21:00]  This is a miracle that we're sharing.  I mean, this is, you know.  She must have been very hurt.  Completely.  Completely.  That's so weird, man.  I was just like, no fucking way.  Did she want to leave too?  Or did you say, look, we're going?  I said, we're going.  That's it.  I mean, picturesque restaurant, Thanksgiving weekend, fireplace.  Set up all nice.  I mean, could not, I mean, I'm not even making money yet and I'm spending big money.  I mean, it's just perfect.  The perfect, like if, if, if my daughter came to me with her husband and they took me, 
[01:21:30]  out to this kind of place to tell me that kind of news, it would have been a memory.  You would feel special.  A memory.  That they did all this.  Oh, completely.  To make it nice.  Drops the fork, sticks, and I just went, you've got, not discussing it.  Check, please.  Got the check.  Got the car.  Did you wrap it up?  Walked out into the thing.  And they were just like, oh, so are we going to see you next weekend?  Got in the car and split. 
[01:22:00]  Well, your wife cried, right?  Yeah, she would.  Of course.  Yeah, yes and no and, you know.  She's used to it, probably.  You know, you get used to that stuff.  You get used to people's reactions being irrational.  Did you say you can't babysit with a hard-on?  Back then, yeah.  I think that line in a little while ago.  What can't you do with a hard-on or something?  I know.  I guess we can't hear everything that goes on this show, but people love sticking up for Jimmy.  Like, you fucking didn't hear him say that?  I'm like, no, I didn't.  Yes, a lot of lines get missed because everyone's talking and we're all just conversational. 
[01:22:30]  I don't know why we'll get missed once in a while.  That is a great line.  I can wrap it up with this.  Today, I don't really like talking too much personal shit, but my kids, too, today.  Ah, bravo.  And my mother-in-law is at my house right now.  Wanted to take the day off.  Calls like, is it all right?  Man, I just want to be there, even though we're going to throw a kid party this weekend?  Uh-huh.  I just want to be.  I'm like, yeah, of course.  I will guarantee you that my mom won't even call today. 
[01:23:00]  And guess what?  I swear, and it won't even bother me.  Right.  Anymore.  Anymore.  That's the key.  Yeah.  But I swear to you, she won't even call.  But you will be aware.  Yeah, I'll be aware.  I'll always be aware.  But I'm not going to walk around my house bummed out about the fact.  I feel sorry for her that she's missing out on such shit.  We have a birthday going on with the six-year-old this week, and who had a party on Sunday.  So my wife makes this big cake and stuff, and... 
[01:23:30]  I would like to have gone to that party.  Yeah, why are we invited, Tom?  We're a fun guy at a party.  We're friends.  Conversational.  We're jokey.  We're friends.  Another thing you can't do in an erection is come to little kids' birthday parties.  Well, if you're dressed as a clown.  I don't...  But same thing.  I mean, my parents...  I tend to just argue politics with children.  Barba care.  But mine cannot.  Mine want to crash it.  Mine want to come to the party and on the day, on Thursday, and then see them again on Mother's Day.  Can we do another cake? 
[01:24:00]  I mean, we have to stop them from showing up.  The other one is going to be down the street getting her hair cut on the day that my wife  makes this big cake and everything, and tells her, why don't you stop by?  For a little cake?  Yeah.  No, I don't...  I don't think so.  I'm not...  No.  I don't do those kind of...  I know.  No.  It's not about you doing those kind of things, though.  Exactly.  It's not about you.  You just do it.  Exactly.  Like, my kid will not even remember that he turned two.  Do you understand that shit?  Exactly. 
[01:24:30]  How's her dad?  Um, like, beaten man.  That's the worst.  My dad was a beaten man.  Beaten.  My dad had horrendous heart problems, and I'm convinced most of it was the stress that  my mom brought upon him.  Oh, completely.  I think he knows...  Can you imagine when they're alone in the night, what was going on?  Right.  I mean, you're seeing, like, even the, you know, the public version, really, within the  family, when they're alone, and really, she's letting loose.  Holy shitballs.  God, it makes me fuck...  I get such a hateful reaction to that. 
[01:25:00]  You know what?  Oh, my God.  Terrible.  I chose not to do it, because we're, you know, we're having a good conversation here,  but the phones are lit.  I love hearing people calling with this type of stuff.  Lit.  Everybody relates to it.  Everyone has one in their lives.  Oh, God.  Maybe not everyone, but a lot.  Now, let me tell you, the one benefit, if we can talk about the positive part of it  is, when the holidays come around, and Mother's Day comes around, you only have to take care  of one side.  You only have to do one part.  There's no going back and forth.  There's no, what are we going to do for both of them? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, and she doesn't even care, right?  Doesn't care.  Yeah.  Doesn't care.  Doesn't care.  We got to go out to dinner, Tom.  She should stop spending time with her mom.  That's the only way to do it.  But she doesn't want to, and, like, she still wants to.  Acceptance and still wants the.  No, it's hard.  No, I know.  I know.  It took many, many, many, many years.  It's easy to say.  I mean, I say the same thing, but I come from a family where they cannot stop praising you.  You know what I mean?  Where it's purely positive. 
[01:26:00]  It takes a lot of years.  And what resonated with me was the wedding thing.  I'm like, wait a minute.  You know, a wedding is like a new beginning.  You're starting your own.  Yeah.  You're truly starting your own life.  This is my family.  And your own family and all that.  So when it hit that day, I'm like, all right.  It just was so obvious what I needed to do.  Oh, yeah.  There was not even a down in my mind, finally.  So healthy.  I was like, no.  So healthy.  No, thank you.  I mean, we've had friends that have been toxic, like our age.  And you can see, like, they're basically your mom or mother-in-law. 
[01:26:30]  And every time you leave, like, you'd be in a fight or you'd feel shitty about yourself.  And it's like, no, let's just cut them out.  What are we doing?  Right.  And when you do cut them out, all of a sudden your life is lighter.  Right.  You're happier.  Do I know any of these people?  No.  Is there any in this room?  Oh, you looked around, though.  Oh, boy.  No.  And comedians?  Boy.  No, not comedians.  I find, I don't really, well, yeah, there's some comedians.  That's a good question.  My mom liked it because she had to handle seven kids. 
[01:27:00]  I'm sure it didn't help.  But I'm sure she had issues going into this whole fucking, no, I know she did, without  getting too personal.  Yeah.  She had a lot of issues growing up.  Yeah.  And I think my dad was the type of guy that thought he could fix her.  My grandmother had seven.  She could not be more loving.  It's just the person.  It has nothing to do with the circumstance.  My dad thought he could fix her.  Yeah.  But thank God, or I wouldn't be here.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  That was good.  But no, they are what they are.  And you really can't change them.  I hate people who blindly love parents.  Like, I hate people who go, hey, you know, you only get one.  And I understand loving your parents.  Yeah.  But regardless of who they are as people, you should love them.  No, you shouldn't.  Yeah.  I love my parents because they're really nice.  I'm very lucky.  Yeah.  Seinfeld had a joke, and I'm sure Tom knows it.  Yeah, Tom.  Do you know the fucking joke about family?  No.  I'll fuck it up.  And it resonated with me as a statement instead of a joke. 
[01:28:00]  But he basically said, you know, do you ever sit around your table and look at your relatives and your family and say to yourself, you know, if I wasn't related to these people, I would never hang out with them.  Right.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Pretty good line.  Yeah.  I'm sure I botched it somewhere.  But I remember hearing that from him and went, holy fuck, is he right?  Right.  This is a statement.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like we're just by chance.  So now we've got to spend birthday parties.  Yeah, we're forced to.  We never.  Now everything's giving is with these people. 
[01:28:30]  I have relatives that I fucking hate.  But I got it.  And I'm sure some of them hate me.  It works both ways.  But because you're all family, you have to put up with their shit.  I always have that thing where, like, you get annoyed with people, you don't like people.  And then it really never dawns on me that maybe they don't like me, too.  Sure.  Well, you got to be honest with yourself.  Of course.  You know, it's human nature.  I know.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's something that you do that one of them is like.  So what happens on Mother's Day this weekend? 
[01:29:00]  Well, my brother's trying to get me to go out to the island to do a little something.  So she'd be there?  Well, he wants numbers.  He wants numbers.  He wants numbers, meaning a bunch of us.  What about your wife's?  For what?  Mother's Day.  We got a kid party.  Oh, you got to do the kid party.  We got a kid party then Mother's Day.  Wow.  So I don't know.  Yeah.  We'll go out to dinner or something.  Fuck, I got to get her something, huh?  We've been advertising for a million companies.  Flowers, candy, Vermont Teddy Bear, whatever it is.  I don't like any of that stuff. 
[01:29:30]  We're having Mother's Day at my place.  And we asked the...  We're having a kid party.  And I think some of the people are staying over.  So, holy fuck, I realized I got to get her something.  We might be in the card stage.  Nice card.  Yeah.  Flowers.  But you got to do something from the boy.  Oh, yeah.  I do that.  That's the stuff that means something.  Yeah, I do that.  I'm going to go to Pro Flowers, I decided.  Oh.  Pro Flowers.  That's a great idea.  Where did you come up with that idea? 
[01:30:00]  I just threw some Pro Flowers away yesterday.  Did you really?  And that's a good...  But they lasted a few weeks.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  But we finally had to get rid of them.  They're so easy to go to.  Your mom...  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Your mom answers the door.  Picture this.  Your mom answers the door and it's a delivery driver.  Do you know where I'd love to go with this, Reed?  We did.  We did two days ago.  Oh, okay.  Where he has a big hog.  And he's servicing your mom.  Yeah.  That's probably what she really wants.  Giving it to her good on the floor.  Linoleum printing her back. 
[01:30:30]  With a turgid penis.  Just relax.  I'm a pro.  Yeah, she's from a young lad.  She's looking at the color difference in their skin.  Suddenly the help has new meaning.  I needed dead air there, so now I can do the read and they can isolate this and go, see,  they're really good for your business.  They always get back on track, though.  Picture this.  Your mom answers the door and it's a delivery driver.  He's brought her a gorgeous Pro Flowers bouquet and it's from you for Mother's Day.

How'd Jimmy like this?  Wait, I gotta tell you what it is.  I know what it is.  You know the song?  Yes.  Wait.  I'm going to go J-Z. 
[01:32:30]  No, Sem125.  Sem125?  I know the song.  What's the only song?  I think you're right.  Well, you don't know it then.  I know it's Sem125.  I do know it.  You got this.  Well, sit back.  Give me one word of the song title.  No, no, no.  You figured it out.  Go ahead.  What album is it on?  I think The Real Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers. 
[01:33:00]  Not Encore?  Marshall Mathers, I believe.  Encore.  Back by Pablo Demand.  No, it's later.  Back by Pablo Demand.  You're a rock star.  That's a great chorus.  We made you.  Yeah.  Did you figure it out?  I think.  You got it?  I think.  I might be wrong.  Is it an Eminem song or a G-12 song?  Yes, sir.  It's Eminem.  Oh, okay.  We made you, right?  We made you.  Yeah.  Nice, Jimmy.  It's a good tune.  It's a great chorus. 
[01:33:30]  Jimmy, that was good.  I love Eminem.  It's fucking brilliant.  I don't know this one, though.  So maybe I don't love it as much.  Rock star.  This was off of Relapse.  Yes.  And back by Pablo Demand.  He had a really weird rhyme scheme in this.  Ooh, rhyme scheme.  Back by Pablo Demand.  Now pop a little Zantac.  Fantastic if you can.  You're ready to tackle any task.  I love this record.  I heard he didn't like it.  I hate it.  Really?  You hated it? 
[01:34:00]  You didn't like My Mom?  Turn this down.  Play My Mom or I'll spit in your face, Yorick.  I think that was the one song on the album I liked.  He's doing funny voices for every single song.  This isn't his voice.  It's cartoony.  Yeah.  My Mom is fucking brilliant.  And so is the other one about fucking the stepfather molesting him.  That was fucking hardcore, man.  Yeah.  No rapper talks about that shit.  And if it's in a rap song, it happened, right?  No, I think that's part of the culture.  What was the rap?  If it's in the rap song, it happened. 
[01:34:30]  What was the second song?  Don't play My Mom.  My Mom's a good one.  He hates his mother.  Oh, well, well.  Look what we got here.  Tell Yorick if he doesn't find him.  Happy Mother's Day.  What are the songs on Relapse, Yorick?  I'll tell you right now which one here.  Why won't he play My Mom?  Because he's just a punk motherfucker.  I don't have that in here.  How do you not have My Mom?  Why wouldn't they have every Eminem song?  Can't you just pull it off YouTube?  Yeah, why don't we do that?  Let's go to YouTube.  What's the song?  I'll tell you which one.  My Mom. 
[01:35:00]  I made you.  No, go from the top.  Dr. West.  No.  3 a.m.  No.  My Mom.  Yes.  Insane.  You said no to my mom.  No, no, no.  The song I'm thinking of.  Bagpipes from Baghdad.  Insane.  Hit play Insane.  I think that's it.  Do you have that one, Yorick?  Not in this system.  Let me check the other one.  What is this system?  Not in an Eminem song.  I don't know.  Fucking douchebags.  They pay him enough money not to do a radio show.  It's funny, right?  You think they have all this whole catalog for fudge's sake. 
[01:35:30]  Your risk of dying from lung cancer.  What else are you going to do with this channel?  If he's not going to do a radio show for it, you might as well play all his songs.  I was born with a dick in my brain.  Yeah, fuck in the head.  My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed.  So one night he snuck in and said, we're going out back.  I want my dick sucked in the shed.  Can't we just play with Sadie Ruxpin instead?  After I fuck you in the butt, get some head.  Bust a nut, get some rest.  The next day my mother said, I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid.  The pastor won't even eat nothing, he's dead. 
[01:36:00]  He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead.  Jerry, don't let that fucker get too upset.  Go in there, stick a fucking cigarette to his neck.  I bet you he's faking it, I bet you.  I bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get.  I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object.  I'll go fucking brains out of Vinny's left in his head.  If you count the skeletons in my closet, under my bed, no, under my faucet.  Then you would know I completely crossed it.  Is he nuts?  No, he's insane.  If you count the skeletons in my closet, under my bed, no, under my faucet. 
[01:36:30]  Then you would know I completely crossed it.  Is he nuts?  No, he's in your game.  Y'all, fuck, I tried to bite my face off.  I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw.  Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fucking blades off.  Ate a blade, stuff a baseball, and a slingshot.  Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop.  Took his eye out, picked it up, and played ping pong.  Then he played ping pong with his own gang gong.  That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong.  Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn.  Then he laid all up underneath it with the thing on. 
[01:37:00]  Then he took his pants, he took every fucking thing off.  No rapper raps about this shit.  No fucking rapper talks about being afraid.  That house sounds exhausting.  Yeah.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Oh, fuck.  Our moms aren't so bad. 
[01:37:30]  Love you, mom.  Holy shit.  Yeah, it's pretty great.  It's fucking hardcore, man.  Yeah, Eminem's all right.  He just talks about things that are very...  Is he done?  What's going on with him?  No, I don't think so.  I mean, he put out another album after Relapse, but he's...  He's kind of like Recovery.  Recovery.  But they're not...  You're down on Eminem, Sam.  He had big hits over that album.  Yeah, but those albums are not comparable to what he did.  Really?  Is it a drop-off, you think?  Of course.  But I like this.  I like my mom.  What happens to everybody?  It's everybody, you know. 
[01:38:00]  Jay-Z didn't drop off.  What was the great song off this record?  Jay-Z drops off.  He's going to drop off eventually.  He's 40 years old.  If he drops off now, it's okay.  I think Eminem is better than Jay-Z.  But he didn't continue to rise.  He had some that weren't that great.  Yeah, but they just came back up.  What was the...  Beautiful was a great song off that record.  Which one?  Fucking Beautiful.  You didn't like that?  What are you, a fucking Peter Pumper?  Peter Pumper.  That's a great album.  I think he's much better than Jay-Z.  I don't think so.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Someone said I cut you off, Tom Papa. 
[01:38:30]  What are you doing for Mother's Day?  I guess I cut you off.  Oh, I was just saying that we're having it at my place.  And the in-law was like, no, I don't do that.  We invited her to come along, too.  And she's like, no, I'm not a mother.  I'm not a mother.  I'm done with that.  I was like, all right, perfect.  How many kids did she have?  Four.  All normal. 
[01:39:00]  And they all try.  They all just keep trying.  Yep.  You got to stop trying.  Stop trying.  It's the hardest thing to do, though, Jimmy.  I know.  No, no, I know.  I wish I stopped a long time ago.  But I'm happy I finally got there.  I get annoyed for you.  When you tell those stories, I get angry for you.  That's how I feel.  I get the same thing.  I don't love him like you love your wife.  You don't?  I want to clarify that.  No.  I love Opie, but not like that.  Oh, that's weird.  Not even homosexuality.  It's not even that intense.  Yeah, it's no dicks in the butter.  No, no.  He just worries about me. 
[01:39:30]  I wouldn't even hold you, but I would comfort you firmly.  You wouldn't hold him?  We've hugged.  Do you ever hug?  Yeah, we've had very nice hugs.  That's good.  Not man hugs.  Almost too nice.  The hugs of two lovers with the arms become intertwined on the backs.  Something you can do with an erection.  And should.  One of the best moments ever was I was with Jimmy.  I was out on Long Island, and he was at a gig at the old porn theater.  Oh, yeah.  And I didn't know how to tell him I was going to be a father. 
[01:40:00]  I probably picked the wrong moment.  It was in between shows.  And it was awesome.  It was awesome.  What did I do?  Gave me a really nice hug.  I did hug you.  Okay.  You were really...  Yeah, I was happy for you.  You were extremely happy for me, and it all came through this hug.  Wow.  I'm a nice guy, Tom.  See, Sam?  It's very nice.  Again, nice.  No, but if you had just stopped that...  That was a nice moment me and Jimmy had.  But if you had stopped that before pointing out the fact that you were nice because of 
[01:40:30]  that moment, then maybe people would have been able to say, oh, he's nice.  But once you say, see, I'm nice.  And he held the hug.  And it was really Jimmy who was nice.  It wasn't really...  You were just the recipients of nice.  He held the hug through the uncomfortable stage, but it was okay.  You know, if you hug another guy, it's like, okay, all right.  But he went past that.  And for some reason...  45 minutes.  45 minutes later.  Until the next show.  And it was just an excuse to hug him.  Because originally, I was going in for the hugs.  I thought he was talking about traffic.  I didn't care.  I just wanted to hug that fucking body. 
[01:41:00]  I went past the uncomfortable stage and then got comfortable again.  You need to know the truth.  I'm comfortable.  I was just a really...  Yeah.  I don't talk about this shit a lot on the show.  It was a really nice fucking moment, man.  That's very nice.  I'm very comfortable being like that with my friends.  I don't know why.  I just am.  I have no problem.  Cynthia was saying something last night.  My wife was saying, we all went to dinner on Monday.  Was she making fun of my chin?  No.  But she was saying how funny comedians are, especially our circle of friends. 
[01:41:30]  She said because...  And she pointed out something you were doing.  Because you had said some joke.  It was some kind of nasty something or other.  She goes, comedians are so funny like Jim.  Because it'll be so like...  It could be so dark and so like cutting.  But then he was like taking Robert shopping for Weight Watchers to make sure that his diet  was okay.  And she goes, it's such a weird mix of comedians of so sweet and brotherly and then so completely  cold and neurotic.  I just was tired of him stepping on my foot. 
[01:42:00]  I'm like, this has to change.  Fucking...  Enough already.  Hey, I wrote this down.  You were talking about water bottles and how you drank Jimmy's...  Out of mine.  I swigged it and Jimmy's definitely sick.  Why'd you bring that up again?  And you had three massive gulps and it's obviously his backwash.  I hate seeing water bottles around my apartment half fucking...  I'm with you.  I drink them.  And it drives my wife nuts. 
[01:42:30]  No matter whose they are?  Well, I know it's pretty much going to be hers.  But every once in a while, I guess I get a wild one.  I drink them.  You just drink it?  I just drink them.  Why not dump it?  Do you ever smell a water bottle when it's been sitting there for a week?  I'll smell...  I will smell the lid to make sure.  Not in the fridge.  It's fine.  In the fridge, it's fine.  But when you pop it, it's like...  They're laying around.  Yeah.  Well, you know, that's cancer causing when they...  What?  If you leave them...  If you leave a water bottle like in the sun for a day, like half the whole thing, and 
[01:43:00]  you drink it, the plastic breaks down into the water.  It's very toxic.  Really?  After a day?  Yeah.  A lot of people won't drink water bottles.  Plastic.  That's why.  Yeah.  And as it breaks down, it's worse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To one day?  Yeah.  And like if you leave it in your car, like you ever leave it in your car?  No, no, no.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So you don't know where a pallet of water has been.  Right.  True.  So the water could be out in the sun already before you...  Sure.  Yeah, they're not good.  They really shouldn't.  I'm going to stop drinking water bottles today. 
[01:43:30]  Thanks, Tom Papa.  But that's pretty disgusting that you just down them in your apartment.  Yeah.  That's one thing that really drives her.  She's like, what are you doing?  When you're drinking it, are you like, why doesn't anyone finish this water?  Yeah, I just slam them because I'm down on my water.  I need to hydrate.  So I see one laying around, I'm like, eh, I'll slam this one down.  Oh, God.  Don't you drink tap water here in the city?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, me too.  A lot of people are scared, but it comes from way upstate, and supposedly we have the best  water.  Yeah.  One of the best waters in America. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, when I'm home, it's all from its half.  Which is hard to believe because you see the shit on the streets of New York.  The pipes are old, though.  The pipes are old.  The pipes give me a little bit old.  Yeah.  Yeah, they have rat duty in them.  A little roosty.  In defense, if the water bottle's a little too low, though, then I'm like, all right,  there might be a little too much backwash in there.  That is nasty.  You don't know who's in your apartment drinking?  Oh, I know.  You do?  I, unlike other people, I know exactly who the fuck's in my house at all times. 
[01:44:30]  You have cameras?  I fucking know.  Trust me.  There's probably only, there's probably only 10 people have been in my apartment.  Really?  Fuck yeah.  Not even every family member has been in my apartment yet.  It's like a compound.  It's, yeah, it's tight.  You guys want to talk about John Travolta?  I got scared.  Yeah, you should.  Yeah, what happened to John Travolta?  Well, he might like to jerk off masseurs. 
[01:45:00]  I firmly believe that the masseurs, even though I think they're kind of scumbags in a weird way,  they don't need, but I do believe what they're saying.  You do?  Why?  Yeah, because of some of the details and the things they're saying are things that I've done.  Oh, what do you mean?  I'll point, as we read through it all.  Yeah, Jimmy plays this game a little bit.  You do?  With a massage therapist.  That looks good.  Yeah, what are you eating, Tom?  I'm going to have a bagel.  Just a bagel?  With cream cheese.  You go plain bagel?  You know all the flavors they got now?  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  You got stuff in your teeth.  Tom's a regular bagel guy.  I get depressed if that's all that's left.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, I go everything.  Fucking raisin.  Cinnamon raisin.  I go a little salt bagel.  Salt's good.  I have to scrape half the salt off.  I like too much salt.  Exactly.  I like.  Tearing the inside of your mouth apart.  I like.  I like an everything bagel.  Nice classic.  Every mouthful is a treat.  There's nothing on that bagel?  But then your breath is all stinky.  You brush your teeth.  Nah, you do all that.  Do all this.  Gargle with some.  I use fresh breath toothpaste. 
[01:46:00]  It's really weird.  TheraBreath.  The worst name for a toothpaste ever, but it's very natural stuff.  Oh, yeah.  It's fucking great.  Do you use deodorant with aluminum?  No.  Yes, I use regular deodorant.  Why?  I heard it was really bad for you, so I tried some without aluminum.  Tom's?  Wait.  Yeah.  Tom's is natural.  It just makes you sweat more and stink more.  Wait, so now we can't use...  You're not supposed to use aluminum in a deodorant.  So we can't use deodorant and we can't drink water anymore? 
[01:46:30]  Or brush your teeth.  How about you go home?  I brush my teeth with TheraBreath.  This guy in five minutes got everyone paranoid with deodorant and water.  Oh, you invite me into the hooping cough den, and I give you some tips about plastic bottles.  I'm the bad guy.  Bill Cosby, I heard, won't drink glass.  He won't drink out of a plastic bottle.  No.  Bill Cosby won't?  Yeah.  And he looks great.  He really does.  He's got a bit of a drop-off, huh?  He does.  It's really old.  All right, so this is the second masseur to come forward as far as John Travolta goes. 
[01:47:00]  Yesterday's filing, I guess, was really some terrific reading.  And from Los Angeles, this guy is from Georgia, from an Atlanta spa.  Atlanta, right?  And apparently Travolta was banned from the day spa or whatever.  I heard he's a naughty boy.  I've heard he's very naughty in spas.  Really?  Imagine they see him coming, like, oh, fuck.  Him again.  He says the pulpit that she danced his heart on.  There's someone that's new. 
[01:47:30]  It's like, yeah, oh, wow, wow.  I get to, oh, my God.  It's just a wrestling match the entire time you're in there.  He's going for the pin, and you're like, oh, fuck.  But is it a real surprise that this Saturday night fever, nobody who dances that well couldn't adore cock.  Look, you can't be that good a dancer as he was in Greece.  Come on.  Exactly.  That's okay, John.  It's fine.  You're a great, talented actor.  Except you stunk in Pelham 123 remake. 
[01:48:00]  One of the worst remakes ever.  The original was amazing.  Gritty, dirty, fucking show in New York how it could be.  Yeah.  That new one was like, I didn't even get through the whole thing.  So what's his move?  He would be in the, he would be in the.  His move is that, do you have the transcript we should read?  This is a good one, dude.  Yeah, this is good.  This is good, and Jimmy's going to stop us because he has some expertise on this.  I do.  And I hate what they call it, doe plaintiff number two is the masseur two.  Okay, so you got. 
[01:48:30]  These are all dudes.  Yeah, only two of them, but it is informed in Belize.  Yeah, don't be confused.  This is a brand new lawsuit.  Yeah, it's from Georgia.  So now Travolta's got to fight off two of these guys.  Same lawyer.  This one came out yesterday, and then this one came out the next day.  Same lawyer.  Yeah, and Jimmy was saying in the bathroom to me, you know, this is going to get ugly.  I think it's going to.  I bet you there's a third by the end of the week.  Same lawyer?  Is suing.  Now Travolta's lawyers, Travolta can get the best lawyers in the world.  Yeah.  But they're asking for a lot of money, two million apiece, a lot of fucking money. 
[01:49:00]  So you got the second massage therapist, masseur, is informed and believes, and upon such information  and belief, states that he was a masseuse working in-house at an Atlanta, Georgia resort, which  has a spa facility where massages are performed, and does in-room massages where the masseuse is  sent to the client's room.  That is common in certain upscale spas.  You can get that, and they are legit.  Right.  You get it in your room.  That's already trouble. 
[01:49:30]  Sometimes.  When you bring them into your room.  But celebrities sometimes will do that.  Like the montage in, I say sometimes the montage in Beverly Hills, which is very reasonable.  It's like a six-star hotel.  Yeah.  But it's not, they don't rape you price-wise.  They're really good there.  It's nice.  And I've gotten a couple of in-rooms for them, but they're completely fucking spa massages.  They're not sexual at all.  Right.  They drape you like a massage.  You know the second they walk in with their fucking scrubs on it, this is a no-nonsense,  legitimate massage. 
[01:50:00]  But you're still thinking maybe.  No.  I have really good instincts.  Like I can tell a minute into it.  You know by the way they touch you, by the conversation, by the body language.  You just know that there's no way when they do your legs.  And I don't get them for that there.  I really don't.  When I go for a spa massage, I'm not looking for anything.  I want like a legit massage.  Right.  All right.  Doe's.  All right.  Doe plaintiff number two.  So that's the masseuse.  Okay.  Second masseuse. 
[01:50:30]  Masseur.  Was assigned to do an in-room massage on, or about January 28th, 2012, for a male client  who demanded a male masseuse.  Yeah.  The client was known as Mr. White.  Do you ever get mail?  No.  Me neither.  I have.  I've had mail.  You have?  It's weird.  It's weird.  When my ex and I went away together.  It's hard to relax.  Yeah.  We were in a spa together, and there was one woman and one man, and I was like, I'll take  the bullet and give her the woman. 
[01:51:00]  Like, because I was more worried about her having an unpleasant experience.  Like, I don't know if this is going to happen to me.  I just didn't want her to be in anything uncomfortable.  And he was fine.  He gave me one of the best masseuse.  I saw him the next day.  He fucking tore.  He didn't go below my back.  Right.  He tore into my fucking back.  I've never had anybody work my back like that.  Right.  Because it was so not homoerotic.  I knew that it was a man, but he fucking.  The best one is like a big Russian woman.  Yeah.  Man hands, but she's still a woman.  Yeah.  I had one yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  Close to where we live there, Jimmy.  That spa near us.  They do a great job. 
[01:51:30]  But I was discussing this yesterday at my house.  Like, there's two types of massages.  There's one.  Oh, I never liked there.  It's really good.  There's one type of massage where it's just chill and you're relaxing.  You could fucking meditate or just go off and just fucking be in space for a while.  And then there's the other one, which I got yesterday, where it's a workout and it fucking  hurts.  And I'm like, why am I paying for this?  Right.  She's literally going, all right, I got to separate the two muscles in your calf. 
[01:52:00]  This is going to be painful.  Oh, no.  So, holy fuck.  But I'm in space for days afterwards.  Like, she puts everything back in place.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But you wonder why you would put yourself through so much pain.  Because a massage is supposed to be relaxing.  That's what we all kind of think.  Right.  But it's like a sports massage.  Which she's really working on.  Yeah.  It's physical therapy.  Yeah, I'm older and I work out a lot still.  So, I like, you know.  It's obvious.  Now I have to separate your calf from your legs.  Sounds like a sports massage.  What feels better than when they're bouncing on your back and they're hitting that knot? 
[01:52:30]  And you always have to go, like, you feel that knot?  I will always say, like, what a naughty boy I am.  Even in the professional massage where you say they come into your room and you feel like  there's going to be no monkey business.  Yeah.  Do you feel like at a certain point you have to go, oh, just to let them know that you're enjoying  it?  Oh, if they're doing my back good, yeah, I'll do that.  But it's a genuine noise.  Yeah, gross hormones come out.  Right.  If they're doing it right.  Because I want them to stay there.  But it's not to guide them. 
[01:53:00]  It's like literally, fuck, I'll say right there, right there.  Because it's not creepy when they're on your back.  Right.  You ever get a rock massage?  No.  We went to a spa.  Hot Stone.  We went to a spa up in Connecticut.  I had a pile of rocks on the top, on my back.  I mean, a pile.  It's like you're growing up again.  Yeah.  And I had to move.  They heat up the rocks, and they put them on your back.  I don't understand.  Yeah.  It's silly.  And I had to move, and all the rocks fell to the floor loudly. 
[01:53:30]  And we're in a pretty nice place, and this lady is bending over, picking up all the dumb  rocks off the floor in the middle of the massage.  The whole thing just went.  I don't know if she was building like a mini castle in my back.  I have no idea.  One move, and they all went.  It's funny.  Yesterday, though, I'm kind of uncomfortable to say this, but she went with a couple hot  stones, put a couple near the crack of my butt.  That's fine.  Really?  A little part of the spine.  Felt pretty good.  Really?  Felt pretty good.  No funny business. 
[01:54:00]  No.  It was all on the up and up, but a couple hot stones right at the top of my crack, and  I went, not bad.  Do you know what?  I've come to Love Massage.  Not bad.  Have you gotten your fucking, you're a righty, your right forearm?  Like, because of all the texting and stuff we do on phones, and like, when they start  digging into your right forearm, you're like, holy fuck.  Right.  Why would I waste time with my cock when this could get done?  This is wonderful.  I like when she works the hands.  Yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:30]  The hands is really, I find the hands very intimate.  Yeah.  When they start doing your hand, there's something very intimate about hand on hand.  And you're tempted to close your hand around it and go like, aye.  But I'm fucking hurting today.  She got the muscles back in place, but I am fucking sore.  Man, I haven't had one in such a long time.  All right, so we got Mr. White.  That's where we were.  The client was doing it as Mr. White and was told this was an alias for John Travolta. 
[01:55:00]  You think you would have had a better fucking nickname than Mr. White?  Mr. White.  It's awful.  Mr. White.  Yeah.  In a bad spy movie, you idiot?  Mr. White.  It's like Reservoir Dogs.  He wanted to be in it.  It's the color of cum.  Yeah.  Okay, so the masseur does not prefer to do in-room massages and asked a co-worker to take the assignment.  And his co-worker declined because John Travolta had been banned from a spa that the co-worker used to work at in the L.A. area. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, okay.  Because I had heard that he was banned from a spa a while ago.  Oh, I heard that.  So another, yeah, masseur said, hell, fucking no, he's, you know, Travolta, you know, was banned from the spa that he used to work at in L.A.  Now they're all in Atlanta.  Okay.  How?  Masseur is informed and believes and upon such information and belief states that John Travolta is the Mr. White who is staying on the 15th floor of an Atlanta, Georgia resort,  which will be identified confidentially to the consul for the defendant, whatever, okay, we didn't need to read that. 
[01:56:00]  Masseur is informed and believes upon blah, blah, blah, was told to go to a room on the 15th floor of the Atlanta resort.  Well, the line right before that, he had, you don't want to miss that, he had substantial documentation and numerous witnesses regarding the substance of defendant Travolta's actions as alleged herein on or about January 20th.  He's saying he has witnesses and documents.  How do you have witnesses to a private massage?  I do not know or to something.  It might be that hamburger guy again. 
[01:56:30]  Maybe.  Maybe the hamburger guy is turning on him.  The story yesterday, Travolta has a guy making hamburgers.  He loves hamburgers.  He does?  He loves, yeah, cheeseburgers.  He always talks about cheeseburgers.  He loves cheeseburgers.  Loves cheeseburgers.  Always eats cheeseburgers.  He talks about Pulp Fiction, of course.  Yeah, loves them.  Okay, so, uh, he's going to have awful lactose farts.  John Travolta's assistant answered the door, Jimmy.  Yes.  So there's your witness.  Answered the door and told the masseur to set up in the bedroom and set up. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  You didn't have to say it that way, but fine.  What a weird thing.  That was a weird sentence.  To set up in the bedroom and set up.  John Travolta just walked into the bedroom and spoke very briefly and then removed all his clothes.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Travolta's quickness to completely undress happened during both the encounters involving masseur number one and masseur number two. 
[01:57:30]  Defendant had a strange demeanor.  John Travolta had a strange demeanor.  Bloodshot eyes and climbed onto the already set up massage table.  By the way, you should be playing a Grey song because Travolta sings them.  This is good, though.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Masseur number two then covered John Travolta with a sheet.  So he climbs up there with bloodshot eyes, naked, and kind of crazy, and the guy has to cover him with a sheet. 
[01:58:00]  Ah, ah, ah, yeah.  Masseur number two is informed and believes upon such information and belief.  States that John Travolta removed the sheet with his legs and feet.  I totally believe in masseur.  That that's how you do it.  That you would just kick it off?  Yeah, totally.  Like a kid.  You've done this?  Of course.  No, there's no way.  Not that aggressively, but yeah.  Masseur number two replaced the sheet, and John Travolta responded by taking it off again. 
[01:58:30]  This happened several times.  Very sexy.  Meow.  What I don't understand is that everyone knows what's going on in that room, so why doesn't the masseur go, look, I gotta go?  He doesn't want to get in trouble with the hotel problem?  Yeah, and it's also Travolta, you know, he's an atypia.  It's also an icon.  Yeah.  He's not a regular dude, man.  He's not even a regular actor.  He's an icon.  Right, exactly.  He's huge.  Travolta.  Masseur number two is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that John Travolta removed the entire sheet from his body,  and he claimed that the sheets were sticky and he could not tolerate the sheet. 
[01:59:00]  It's just so sticky.  Masseur number two is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that John Travolta told Masseur number two that he does not want the massage performed using Masseur number two's elbows or forearms,  and wanted him to use his hands.  I've pulled that line many times.  Why?  You don't like the elbow?  Oh, because you want something else.  I'm sexual, right.  Okay.  I don't like elbows.  I don't like elbows.  I don't like elbows. 
[01:59:30]  Travolta further indicates, indicated that he likes a lot of glutes work, meaning a massage on his butt.  I totally believe in Masseur.  You think I haven't thrown the glutes line out?  You want to say because you're rubbed by my asshole, but that's too vulgar, so you say glutes so you don't sound like a pig.  Like a sound official.  Rub the glutes.  I don't like elbows, and I like it on my glutes.  Yeah, like your hands.  Your hands.  Masseur number two is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that he was massaging John Travolta, 
[02:00:00]  and at times John Travolta would hump the table.  I completely believe in Masseur.  These are all the moves.  Sandy.  At one point, John Travolta fell asleep for approximately five minutes and woke up and demanded that his glutes be done immediately.  He woke up, and he realized that time was ticking.  He's like, back to the asshole.  So wait a minute.  Wait a minute, though. 
[02:00:30]  He's so frisky that he's kicking the sheet off.  He's wiggling around.  He's like, get on my glutes and no elbows.  You can fall asleep.  And then you knock out?  Sure, that happens.  Absolutely.  When you wake up and you realize that the hands are fucking wasting time on the shoulders,  and you're like, there's an asshole to be tended to.  Chop, chop.  I don't know.  Because you know that you're pushing it.  It's an excitement of being, well, maybe if you do it all the time, it's commonplace.  Trust me, you can fall asleep.  I have.  I've fallen asleep.  I've fallen asleep, too, because I'm not trying to get laid. 
[02:01:00]  If I'm, like, trying to get a nice handle on my glute.  High alert.  Yeah, yeah.  You're on high alert.  Right.  Uh, masseur number two is informed, and upon such information and belief, states that  while he was massaging near John Travolta's buttocks area, John Travolta, excuse me, would  open his legs and spread his butt cheeks open and had a full erection and would maneuver  in a way to try to force masseur number two to touch his anus around and around his anus. 
[02:01:30]  He was fucking, that means I completely believe him as well.  He was opening his own asshole?  I don't know if it was with his hands or just pushing back, because you can move the asshole,  but I've done that move a million times.  How do you open up your asshole without using your hands?  Push it back.  Push it back and your cheeks open a little bit.  Really?  And you push your fucking rod back between your legs so the guy touches.  I don't like doing that, though.  How do you know you have an erection when you're on your stomach?  You push it back between your legs so it's fucking poking back like a dog tail.  I've pulled that move. 
[02:02:00]  Mine doesn't go that way.  Yeah, also if you lift up high enough, they could probably see the fucking bed.  The thickened Vaz Deverns.  The Vaz Deverns.  Sansie, take a look at this.  Oh, wow.  Masseur number two is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief,  states that John Travolta asked him, can you get right here, and pointed and put his hand  in between his buttocks, cheeks, and towards his anus. 
[02:02:30]  When you dance like that.  He pointed toward his own anus there.  Jimmy.  Yeah, I guess that was his method.  I personally wouldn't do something that overt.  And by the way, even though I do believe in Masseur, but this is why I think the lawsuits  are so phony.  Say I'm leaving right now, and then leave.  Yeah.  That's all you got to do is walk out.  Yeah, I'm wondering why he didn't.  Because he's fucking...  Was he scared for his job?  No.  No.  Maybe it's a cushy gig at this nice spa.  You tell them... 
[02:03:00]  Maybe he's thinking, fuck, no one's going to believe that John Travolta's trying to get  me to check him off.  But he comes in, everyone there, people wouldn't do it because of his reputation, and then you  walk in there, and he's got a big boner.  Yeah.  You know.  All right.  Why would you stay in?  Masseur number two avoided the area and avoided the buttocks.  Masseur number two is informed and believes upon, blah, blah, blah, that John Travolta said  Masseur number two had big and dense hands.  Masseur number two is informed and believes upon, oh, Jesus. 
[02:03:30]  Your hands are so dense.  Then he went to massage John Travolta's other side, and John Travolta kept spreading his  butt cheeks.  Oh, no.  You think a smell came out of there?  Hamburgers.  I love burgers.  Masseur number two observed that John Travolta's butt cheeks and rectum were very red and chapped  as though there had been a lot, a lot of movement and friction. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Meaning what?  Meaning something might have been going in and out quickly of his asshole.  It was a jalapeno burger.  His asshole was all beat up.  Or chapped.  Or maybe there was, maybe, if it's true, maybe he was putting stuff, maybe he says psoriasis  of the asshole.  Holy fuck.  Look, anybody, you look down there, everybody's just going to look a little worked over.  It's a high productive area.  That's true.  Oh, my God.  Masseur number two is informed and blah, blah, blah, that John Travolta suddenly turned  on his stomach.  I think that's a misprime. 
[02:04:30]  I think they mean back.  Turned on his back with his legs wide open with a full erection.  Yeah, that is.  So he fucking suddenly turned onto his back with his legs wide open with a full erection.  Holy fuck.  He then tried to force the Masseur's hand on his scrotum.  Then John Travolta started to grab, rub, and caress Masseur's upper thighs and butt  eyes.  Come on. 
[02:05:00]  I don't buy it.  I completely believe it.  How does, how, are you that, if you're the Masseur.  That's very aggressive.  And you're just like, oh, what are you, just like this frail girl from the 1800s?  He's a guy.  He won't stop.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't believe, no, I think that the guy, that's why I think the lawsuit's bullshit.  Why is there two of them, though?  Because I think that, I don't know how they connected, but I'm betting since this guy  knew people from a spot in LA, I bet they connected to the lawyer somehow through  that.  I totally believe them. 
[02:05:30]  You start rubbing the guy's thing, you're getting a hard on, and you're just still there,  like, maybe I can make this work.  That's where the, that's what I'm confused by.  That's what I think the lawsuit's bullshit.  I think that guy knew.  That's why I'm confused, because it does get to a point where you're like, holy fuck, get  me out of here.  Right.  Right?  So you're saying it's bullshit, Jimmy, because it happened, but the guy obviously should  have left.  Right.  So what's, what's not bullshit about this?  The account of how it happened.  The guy may have been giving off signals he's not saying, but then again, maybe he wasn't.  Maybe he wasn't, because it sounds like he wouldn't rub Travolta's ass, and he didn't 
[02:06:00]  even want to go up and do the room massage.  So something happened, but you're saying he's maybe exaggerating a bit here with some  of his facts?  No, I think he's exaggerating his wounding.  Oh.  I think the guy's exaggerating.  Well, that would help your case.  He's two million dollars.  Right.  That would help your case, right?  Why the fuck are you still massaging him?  The minute he tries to get your hand into his asshole, you say, no, I'm done with this  massage.  You walk out.  He's naked.  By the way, that's probably a violation of state ethics to massage with somebody nude on the 
[02:06:30]  table.  I don't know what Georgia is, but the very fact that that masseur massaged him at all  while he was naked for any reason probably immediately invalidates that claim because,  hey man, if you're legit, I don't care who it is, if you say you have to be draped, it's  state law.  So that guy probably, I don't know what it's like in Georgia, but I'm going to guess it's  the same.  So I think that guy probably violated state law.  So his license should be fucking taken if he actually massaged him naked. 
[02:07:00]  It's like he went with it and now is broke and is like, I'm going to try and get something.  You hear that in the background.  It's tell me more, tell me more.  It's perfect.  No elbows.  Masseur number two is informed and believes, blah, blah, blah, that John Travolta still  had an erection and wanted his abdominals done.  But John Travolta's erection was in the way and he refused to have his penis covered by  a sheet or pillowcase covered.  I've told that move many times, what are you doing staying in the room while he's on 
[02:07:30]  his back with a full erection?  What are you doing?  Right.  Why he's there with a full erection?  Yeah, why are you trying to figure out how to get around an erection?  Why aren't you leaving?  Right, exactly.  Boy, I've got to try to figure out how to get around this erection.  Jeepers, I've never seen this before.  To massage the stomach muscles a bit.  I like how his erection gets in the way of his abdominals.  He used to be hung like a horse.  Masseur states that John Travolta at the time also grabbed between Masseur's legs and  pulled away. 
[02:08:00]  And he pulled away.  Okay.  Masseur is informed, blah, blah, blah, that John Travolta started masturbating about  with 15 minutes left in the session.  We're running out of time.  And Masseur said he had to go.  So he wouldn't tolerate the jerking off, but he tolerated him being naked and playing  grab ass for 45 minutes?  Opening up his cheek, pointing at his asshole.  Right, exactly.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's why I believe his account, but I don't believe he's a victim at all.  He should have immediately closed up shop. 
[02:08:30]  He could just walk out.  Right.  I wish somebody could say he knew the state law in Georgia, but I'm going to guess it's  completely illegal to massage the military.  The state law is you're not supposed to open up your butt cheeks and point to your asshole.  Yeah.  That's probably a good state law.  I believe that's in the books down there.  But are you allowed to massage somebody?  Safe to say.  Is draping optional in Georgia?  Right.  Masseur number two.  Masseur number two is informed.  Okay.  That John Travolta then said he was coming back to the resort that December. 
[02:09:00]  Masseur number two worked out of, and Masseur number two hurried off after John Travolta  forcibly hugged him.  Trying to make things okay.  Yeah.  Masseur number two is informed.  States.  Masseur number two complained to all of his supervisors and many co-workers to no avail.  So there's got to be a record of that, right?  Yeah.  But that's probably what they're afraid of.  Masseur number two states that John Travolta then came down to the spa that Masseur number 
[02:09:30]  two worked at, which is part of the resort Travolta was staying at, as opposed to having  Masseur number two go to his room.  John Travolta demanded that Masseur number two come back and do it again, and he refused.  So maybe he didn't like it, but I don't believe that he's that wounded.  I think that he should have walked the fuck out of that room.  You're not trapped.  You're not being held down. 
[02:10:00]  Just a little lower.  Yeah.  It looks red because I like hamburgers.  His asshole really is red.  My wife and I have had massages in Georgia.  Georgia, and you're allowed to be nude.  Oh, you are.  Okay.  According to Sam in Georgia.  Okay.  Let's go to Joe in Florida.  Let's see.  Hey, Joe.  What do you say, Joe?  Hey, you know, I'll tell you what.  Jimmy definitely has it spot on.  He is right. 
[02:10:30]  Jimmy knows.  Because 20 years ago, I'm going back 20 years.  I'm in Daytona, and he used to live down here, has this plane in a fly-in community.  And a guy that used to massage my wife and I, he had this story, and I'm like, no way.  He's like, listen, John Travolta, I had to go out to his house at the fly-in.  And he walks out of the room totally naked.  I'm like, can you put something on?  And he's like, what the hell? 
[02:11:00]  He gets down on the table, and he's asking him to do all this stuff.  And he keeps looking at him like real weird, and he felt so uncomfortable.  He's like Latin American dude, right?  He's so uncomfortable.  Well, not to just be all legal about it, but I've got to jump in.  We have to.  We literally don't know if this is true or not.  We have no clue, sir.  Oh, I know, but this is 20 years ago, Jimmy.  I've never called in before.  I've listened to your show for 10 years.  I've never called in.  No, we believe your sincerity, sir.  We believe your sincerity.  I believe that this is what you believe, but we have to protect our own asses. 
[02:11:30]  We have no fucking idea.  We have to say legally.  That's how this has to work.  We have no idea.  This is what you're saying, and you're allowed to say what you think happened.  Right, right, right.  It's just weird.  I mean, he had this story 20 years ago, and we were like, come on.  I mean, he's like an upstanding guy, 20 years, just at the fly-in community.  And he had to leave the fly-in community because his plane was too big.  Like, go figure.  Well, you know what it is. 
[02:12:00]  Back then, there wasn't the Internet, too, so people couldn't communicate as openly.  People can pass shit so quick.  One allegation pops up, and all of a sudden, a bunch pop up.  You are right, Jimmy.  In Florida here, you have to be covered in some way.  I don't know what it is like in Georgia, but you have to be covered.  Well, yeah, maybe Georgia is nude, but I somehow have a hard time believing that you're allowed to massage totally nude in a spa setting.  But maybe the guy was only doing body work and not a massage, and there is, I think, legally a difference between a licensed massage therapist and LMT and somebody just doing body work. 
[02:12:30]  All right, thank you very much, sir.  He was uncomfortable.  He was definitely uncomfortable.  If it happened, okay, cool.  All right, Joe.  Thank you, sir.  All right, hey.  That's a great one, and thanks a lot.  Bye-bye.  A little lower.  A little lower.  Just do it a little lower.  Sorry it's so red.  So that's number two.  I'll be interested to hear.  Can't wait for number three.  This has to be making Travolta crazy. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, the worst.  The most embarrassing, humiliating allegations.  It can't get worse than talking about the condition of your bunghole.  Especially when you're a guy like him who's been seen as a lady-killing sex symbol.  There's been rumors for years, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Didn't it happen with Costner?  Wasn't he accused when he was overseas at some massage place also?  With a guy?  I never heard that.  I think it was with a girl. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, I never heard that.  I don't know.  Never heard that one.  I hope it's true.  Yeah, there's other Costner stories, though.  Oof.  Wow.  Oh, that's...  He can make the lights in a ballpark go out.  Wow.  Wow.  What a weird thing.  Like, you're...  Just the scene of, like, you're in this hotel room.  You're this big celebrity.  You got your assistant there.  Someone comes in.  You're taking your clothes off.  You're laying down.  It's just like...  How comfortable are you in front of the assistant to do that?  I know.  Exactly.  Because he's seen it all before. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  We're going to break Tom Papa on the old Twitter.  And what else?  Has he got anything going on, Tom?  No.  You can get my special on iTunes if you want to hear some stand-up comedy.  The video?  Tom Papa live in New York City.  Oh, cool.  It's hilarious.  Thank you, Iraq.  You're on our channel, 11 a.m. this Saturday.  Oh.  Friends of the show, the thing that we do on the weekends.  Don't do the elbows.  So we're going to be featuring some of your work.  No elbows. 
[02:14:30]  But no elbows.  Please, no elbows.  No problem.  I like hands.  SiriusXM.  You're listening to O.B.  and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  What else is going on in the world?  Oh, we lost that author.  I never understood that stupid book.  Which one?  Where the Wild Things Are.  Oh, and Maurice Sendak.  You know his name? 
[02:15:00]  Maurice Sendak, yeah.  I don't know his name.  I have to read his name.  He's the best.  Why is he the best?  That book was weird and stupid, and the movie was even worse.  The movie wasn't great.  What's the big deal about this book?  Maurice Sendak was a great children's artist, but he was a cranky, weird guy who just happened  to do children's stuff.  He was amazing.  He doesn't understand why he is known as a children's author, I hear.  He was a pretty dark guy.  But for some reason, the children embraced his books. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, they loved him.  I hated that book.  I loved it.  We got a copy at home.  I even went through it with my kid.  I'm like, what?  It's weird.  What is this?  Monsters?  What?  You know the book, Jimmy?  Where the Wild Things Are.  You don't know where the wild things are?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's in his little weird pajamas.  And Tony Soprano was in the movie.  Uh-huh.  Because I don't know his real name.  James Gandolfini.  I know.  It's actually a really good, cool, it's a very famous book.  Yeah.  I don't like it. 
[02:16:00]  It gets your emotions, your dark, kid, scary emotions in these big, wild monsters.  Oh, it's about a bunch of monsters.  Don't even get me started.  The real monsters live among us, and they're not white.  Just use your elbows.  Put your elbows down on my monster.  This is the worst of all time.  I like doing it, though.  I like that it's the worst Travolta ever.  I'm glad you pointed it out.  I was too scared to.  It's fun to do, though.  It's not a bad Travolta.  Just put your elbows into my glutes. 
[02:16:30]  Sorry about the red pots.  This chewed-up asshole?  What was it?  This bass-mouth asshole.  I eat a lot of burgers.  I know hockey fans in the room, right?  I love hockey.  Did you see the Rangers the other night?  I'm not a Rangers fan, sir.  But that was an insane...  And I officially want the Rangers to lose to the Capitals now.  I wanted the Rangers to win.  I know that's confusing because I'm an Islanders fan, but I was really hoping for a Rangers-Flyers  thing.  I understand.  But now the Flyers are out. 
[02:17:00]  They got eliminated by the Devils.  I couldn't stay up for the whole fucking game.  They ended up losing 3-1.  They're out.  Rangers have a little magic.  Rangers have a little magic.  They're up 3-1.  No, they're up 3-2.  3-2.  Now, a Rangers-Devils series would be nice.  In the playoffs, you need a little magic.  And to score with six seconds left into the third and then win it in overtime.  A minute and a half into overtime.  That's that magic.  They score with six seconds left. 
[02:17:30]  That happens a lot, though, when you pull that fucking goalie.  It seems to work.  I would pull the goalie during a regular game.  Don't pull the goalie.  I just gotta leave it open net.  So you do watch hockey?  Are you a Rangers fan?  I'm a Rangers fan.  Are you?  Yeah.  We can't be friends.  Aw, come on!  I want the Capitals to win the whole thing now.  You do?  The Capitals?  I don't know anything about the West Coast teams.  Yeah, I know.  I'll be honest.  I don't even think I can name a player.  I don't know anything about the West Coast.  The Kings? 
[02:18:00]  People like the Kings.  I know they like the Kings, but I know East Coast hockey, so now I want the Capitals to  win it all.  I absolutely do.  I'm saying it right here.  See?  And I want the Capitals to take out the Rangers now.  Even though I was rooting for the Rangers in this series because I was hoping for the  Flyers thing.  Yes, that's what I want.  But why wouldn't you just immediately go to the Rangers?  Like, if the Islanders took off, I would be like, alright, now I'm gonna...  The Rangers are out, but New York, let me stick with the Island.  Why would the Island be flying? 
[02:18:30]  Because of the abuse I get at the Nassau Coliseum at Ranger-Islander games?  Fuck those people.  It is pretty nasty.  The Mets, then there's more Ranger fans, even though it's where the Islanders play.  No, never.  I get it.  I pick my team and that's it.  Mets, Yankees, when my Mets...  I'm not a big baseball fan these days, but when the Mets are out, no.  Giants, no.  Jets fan.  I'm the total opposite.  You just jump on the other team? 
[02:19:00]  Well, because I came from Jersey, so I'm Giants, Yankees, Rangers.  But because we win so much, and with all those teams, it's easy to root for the Mets and the Jets.  I feel cheated.  So you have two chances of your, quote, teams?  No, but you support them.  They're New York.  Nah, I can't do it.  We have this argument a lot, and I don't know where the percentages are.  I think more people don't jump to the other New York team.  I think it's that way. 
[02:19:30]  I think Yankees will root for Mets, but Mets won't root for Yankee.  Because they lose a lot more, and they're sick of them.  I can't see hardcore Yankee fans rooting for the Mets if the Yankees are out of it.  No.  They will.  I don't see that, and I don't see the...  I absolutely don't see a Ranger fan rooting for the Islanders if the Rangers are knocked out  and a miracle happens and the Islanders are still in the playoffs.  It's so absurd that you have to really kind of...  I don't see that at all.  Knicks, Nets, not as bad.  I'm going to have a problem.  Jets, Giants?  I don't like the Giants.  Never did. 
[02:20:00]  I had.  Never liked the Giants.  What's wrong with you?  I was absolutely rooting against them in the Super Bowl.  Really?  Yes.  See, I wouldn't do that.  But here's my dilemma.  New York above all.  Knicks.  But then you got this Brooklyn Nets thing.  I'm taking a peek.  It looks pretty...  The logo's cool.  It looks pretty fucking cool.  I'll root for them.  The logo's nice.  I think it...  I think...  And it goes against everything I just said, but I think if Knicks are out and the Brooklyn  Nets are in it, I think I might have to root for that.  New York!  I don't know why, but I think.  Maybe because it's brand new. 
[02:20:30]  New York, baby.  It's just always New York in the end with you?  Yeah.  New York overall.  Andy Pettit's going to be starting Sunday's game with the Mariners.  First time in a year and a half.  I know.  Happy Mother's Day.  He didn't do too well his last start, though, with the Miners.  You think it's a bad idea that he's trying to come back?  Yes.  You do?  I think so.  Yeah.  He's going to get hurt.  What do you think, Jim?  You're kind of a Yankees fan.  Yeah, you know, I don't know.  He's going to horse face.  I'm tired. 
[02:21:00]  Go home, Andy.  53.  Lay down, Jimmy.  Let me rub your glutes.  I need my glutes rubbed.  I'll rub your glutes.  Lay down.  Sometimes my ass will get chapped.  I shit a lot of grapes.  Grapes?  Why is it so red?  Who are you supposed to be?  You don't sound terrible.  It's fucking terrible.  Come on, Sandy.  Who are you talking to over there, you fucking cocksuckers?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Fucking piece of shit.  Oh, hey, hey.  Stop being mean to the guests. 
[02:21:30]  Guys.  I'm not being mean to no guests.  Go fuck your mother.  I'll fuck your mother.  No, you won't.  She's a good woman.  Hey.  She don't fuck lots of people no more, ever.  She always fucked a lot of people and still does because she's a whore.  Mind your business.  Hey, it's Mother's Day.  Yeah, it's really getting close to Mother's Day.  Let's see the Brooklyn Nets thing.  Look at it.  It looks great.  It's a black and white logo.  It's an awesome logo.  It's kind of cool.  And finally, it looks like, wait, what does it look like?  It's cool.  It kind of looks like a Bruins logo. 
[02:22:00]  It looks like Boston.  It looks like a.  Like a Boston sports team logo.  A combination of all of them.  Fighting Irish.  It has a little Brooklyn Dodgers.  Yeah, a little Brooklyn Dodgers happening there as well.  It's classic, but contemporary.  But at the same time.  And we got this.  Throat muscles seize up.  We got this Josh Hamilton hitting four homers last night, too.  This guy's an animal.  This guy's wasting a lot of baseballs.  Plays for the Rangers.  16th player in history to do that. 
[02:22:30]  That's four.  That's unbelievable.  I know.  Really is unbelievable.  He's a beast.  I don't really watch the Rangers, so.  I know he's a beast.  He's an animal.  I do know that much.  It hits the ball like fucking boom.  Right?  Yeah.  I didn't know how you followed sports.  Fuck yeah.  I know a lot about sports.  What sports do you like?  Fucking everything.  You excited about the Olympics?  No.  What do you mean no? 
[02:23:00]  I was supposed to swim in the Olympics years ago, but I hurt my back.  That's true.  I was running and stuff.  He flies.  No, you're lying.  Yes, you are.  You're a fucking lying.  I didn't know.  I didn't say anything.  How could I be lying?  Shut up.  Nice blue bottle.  What are you drinking out of that Smurf juice?  You've done that before.  Good one.  Did Chip repeat himself?  Yeah.  Chip's a hack.  Except he's coming up, like he talks like he's just now coming up with it. 
[02:23:30]  Like he's just searching his mind for a punchline, even though he's done that before.  That's the sign of a great comedian.  It always seems like it's coming off the top of his head.  What's the matter?  What is the dictator about?  Sam, why do I have this audio?  Oh.  Well, the dictator is the new Sacha Baron Cohen movie.  Looks good.  Yeah, where he's doing this.  Looks good.  He did, it's the same, he did the character when he poured the fake ashes on Ryan Seacrest. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, I know.  On the red carpet a couple months ago.  Everyone's been outraged over that.  That was crazy, right?  Right.  Well, now the dictator called together a news conference, and the dictator endorsed Mitt Romney.  Is he basically saying he's a Muslim, or to believe he's a Muslim?  How all in is he with this?  I don't believe he has specifically.  Because it's scary to make fun of Muslims, isn't it?  He hasn't.  But it looks like from the trailer that he's basically saying, yeah, I'm a Middle Eastern Muslim.  He's like a Gaddafi.  Right. 
[02:24:30]  He's from the Republic of Wadia.  This is a lot more scripted than his other films.  Yes.  Oh, is it, some of the stuff isn't scripted?  Or is he going with it?  Well, it's not like Borat, where it's, you know, a lot of off-the-cuff gun.  This is a lot more of like a...  Some of that Borat shit was hilarious.  Yeah.  So he's not doing that in this movie?  I think there...  Not as much.  Right.  So there's some of that.  There's elements.  But it looks like a regular movie, the trailer.  Right.  I think it is, except, you know, he did...  He might have popped a few little things in there.  Exactly.  And he probably, you know, filmed... 
[02:25:00]  Smart.  ...around people without telling them what he was doing.  Things like that?  Okay.  And what, he did an interview where he's endorsing Mitt Romney?  No, he did a whole news conference, and he was in character, and he had girls with machine  guns behind him.  When is he coming on our show to promote the dictator?  He's actually not going to be coming on our show.  Well, he was here yesterday.  He didn't do our show.  Why?  He was here?  He's in the building.  We had a great time with him.  What did he do?  He came in as Borat.  We sold his movie. 
[02:25:30]  It was great.  We all got along.  Yeah.  Did he only do Howard?  He only did Howard, and he was not in character, but...  Why wouldn't he do our show?  We had a good time with the guy.  There was no issues there.  I remember him being on your show, and I remember it going very well.  E-Rock said that he tried to enslave Patrice.  He did.  Yeah, he kept saying how he wanted to put him in a cage.  Yes, he did.  Very good.  Very edgy.  But I think, from what I was told, he was only looking to do things with a TV.  A TV element.  A visual element.  Why? 
[02:26:00]  If he's not in character.  They love their television, these Hollywood stars.  But we talked to his people.  This movie's going to blow.  We talked to the people that he wants to go see the movie.  Yeah, this isn't going to be as good as the other ones.  Really, Tom?  Yeah.  It's not.  I can tell.  You usually don't take a stand on things.  You're taking a stand on this one, huh?  You're usually wishy-washy.  Yeah, you're wishy-washy.  You usually play both sides.  Yeah.  Wow.  You're going to match something.  You heard it from Tom Papa. 
[02:26:30]  This movie's going to...  Is it going to blow?  It's going to blow.  Or is it just going to sit there?  Really?  Why do you get that impression?  It looks...  You know what it was?  It was the Seacrest moment.  It was like...  This is kind of phony now.  It's not really...  I think Seacrest was in on it.  Yeah, it's just kind of like...  I really do.  It can't be corny now instead of raw and funny.  Especially when he came out and said he had a second suit.  Mm-hmm.  And try to make believe he always carries a second suit. 
[02:27:00]  No one carries a second suit to a fucking...  Exactly.  Especially a red carpet where you know nothing ever happens.  Exactly.  It just felt corny.  I believe he was completely in on it.  And the scenes in this scene were all according.  And he's also so super famous that everybody knows who he is.  Yeah.  Like when you do...  He's a brilliant guy.  I mean, he's amazing.  Not you, Chip.  But I just don't think it's going to have that same kind of...  All right.  Well, he did a press conference and here's a little clip from that. 
[02:27:30]  This is the only clip worth playing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I support and I give my full support to Mitchell Romney.  He has the makings of a great dictator.  He is incredibly wealthy, but pays no taxes.  And it's not much of a leap to go from firing people to firing squads.  And from putting pets on the top of a car to putting political decedents on the top of them.  He taught me how to do that.  Hey!  What happened there? 
[02:28:00]  Was that funny?  You think it's a...  You tell me.  I fucking tapped out.  What happened?  He was doing it talking to the microphone or something.  What happened?  He was doing some Mitt Romney material.  Yeah, it was good.  Yeah.  You like the chip?  I like political stuff.  You do?  What's with this president's taxes?  That's a little more insightful than you usually are.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Hey!  Roland, no Sacha Baron Cohen, huh?  Why, Roland? 
[02:28:30]  That means he's on our fucker list and I suggest no one sees this movie.  The Panda, ladies and gentlemen.  Please don't see this movie or download it illegally.  Oh!  That's what we do now.  Take it, new media!  Steve sees I'm ahead of you.  Yes.  He just wanted to do visual elements?  The studio goes.  He's only doing TV elements only.  So that's why Howard was on Howard's TV.  Does he at least remember us? 
[02:29:00]  Probably not, right?  No.  Probably not.  He does.  He doesn't remember us.  Nope.  You can't be short, can you?  I can't speak for the man.  Right.  But you know, Roland.  You deal with these people all the time.  Was it a snow job or was it...  Just a studio going.  He's only doing TV elements only and that's all he's done so far.  Well, I hope the movie bombs then.  Oh.  How about that?  That's not enough.  How about that?  That's not enough.  How about that?  How about that?  In your red cheeseburger hole.  The reviews will start coming out tomorrow.  I hope they're horrible reviews. 
[02:29:30]  I hope the movie...  Everybody's going to be seeing Avengers.  I mean...  I hope he fucking dies.  It opens this...  He says!  It opens this weekend?  I think so.  I think so, too.  Oh, well.  Guess what?  No, wait.  Dark Shadows opens this weekend.  Maybe next weekend.  What's Dark Shadows?  What a shame.  The Johnny Depp movie with Michelle Pfeiffer.  Looks good?  It looks weird.  It's not...  He does weird movies, though.  The Avengers is going to destroy everything for the next month.  No one told me the Avengers has made $700 million now.  You're telling me on the way to the bathroom?  How did it make $700 million?  European.  It made $200 million in the U.S. 
[02:30:00]  First week.  But it had already made $200 million in Europe the week before.  And then...  Wow.  Now that it's globally, it's $700 million.  Wow.  Man, oh man.  Is that a hit?  Damn.  I would say...  Biggest of all time, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's made like almost four times the production budget within the first week.  But why don't they just go with actual tickets sold?  Because...  Because it's...  You know, it's stupid because the price of...  I could answer that.  Yeah.  Why?  Because they're fucked up. 
[02:30:30]  That's why they don't...  There's no insight to that statement at all.  They're fucked up.  There's nothing...  It doesn't add anything.  Yeah, how about an acid 10?  It's a very hard playoff, too.  It's really hard.  Impossible.  It's like driving down dead-end streets all day long.  Holy fuck.  It does not help the conversation at all, that statement.  You go down to dead-end, but you see a turn.  You're like, okay, maybe that's the way out.  Nope.  That's a dead-end, too.  Yeah.  My mother had split ends on her hair.  I was like, what are you, washing something? 
[02:31:00]  And you try to involve him, and it's just more like...  He goes out of his way to make sure the conversation stops.  700 million fucking dollars, man.  That's a lot of fucking dough, huh?  That's a lot of money.  I'm disappointed in this Sacha Baron Cohen guy.  Me, too.  Fuck all that stuff.  I always thought you guys were tight.  So did I.  I got a picture and everything to prove it.  That's ridiculous.  And I bought all his shit over the years.  Okay.  What shit did you buy?  By the way, that's why I get pictures.  That's why. 
[02:31:30]  To prove them?  No, because there's no real bond with any of these guys.  None.  So it's like, hey, let me take the picture.  I'm not going to pretend to try to know you.  Right.  There's no real bond with any of these motherfuckers.  So that's why I'm like, I'll take the picture, and then you sign it, and that's it.  That's the first time your explanation of this whole photo thing has made sense to me.  Yeah, but that's always what it's been.  Because I always act like, no, I'm just going to be cool.  But why be cool?  They don't never get this.  They never...  Scarlett Johansson, I have a picture with  from a movie premiere.  And I did Leno this week, and she was the lead guest last week. 
[02:32:00]  I had a segment.  So I was like, I'm going to ask her to sign it.  What, am I going to be cool?  I met her.  We just did the Tonight Show.  And she signed it.  She's like, oh, you were really funny.  She told me a nice compliment.  But then she walked to her dressing room, and she forgot I was alive.  Here's the fuck.  There's no connection there.  Right.  Never will be.  There was a picture of her in the paper yesterday.  Oh, my God.  She's juicy, man.  Did you see what she looked like?  No.  It was that Met thing?  The gala.  The Met Gala thing?  What position did she play in?  By left open.  It wasn't a baseball thing. 
[02:32:30]  She was a Met.  Meet the Mets.  Eat the Mets.  Fucking lick her pussy good.  Jesus.  A little class.  It's a museum.  It's a little class.  We had a little school or something.  I'm fucking on fire.  I wish you were on fire.  Yeah, fuck you.  Hoping you're coughing about your wedding or something.  Do you take this woman?  I say if we last another day, Sam, without the fucking cough happening, I think we're going  to be in the clear.  Really?  I hope so.  We'll have to see where I go.  Mine is unfolding. 
[02:33:00]  So germy in here.  Do you think you got us all sick?  One can only hope.  No, I don't.  You know what?  When I'm sick, I hope I get a lot of people sick.  Why?  Yeah, you want to take people down with you.  Yeah, I kind of want that.  Like a suicide bomber.  That's what makes you an asshole, not a nice guy.  Why?  It's just a thought.  That's a nasty thought.  People have thoughts like that.  It's nasty, though.  It's not nice.  A lot of people, they don't want to admit it.  It's a natural thought.  Yeah, a lot of people don't want to admit it, but if they're miserable, they want a lot  of people around them.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's not nice people, though.  That's a real thought. 
[02:33:30]  That's a real human thought.  I'll take your cigarettes out and lick the back and put them in your pack real quick.  No, you won't.  You've never done that.  I've done that to you.  I don't even smoke.  I'm a cocksucker.  You're just an idiot.  Cloud guy's back.  Who?  Cloud guy.  Who is this douche?  You know, Jimmy, we've been playing his clips for a week straight and no one decided to state 
[02:34:00]  the obvious.  Who is this douche?  You're right.  Who is he?  Why are we giving him attention?  Because he says cloud's funny.  And everyone is picking up on it.  It's really going viral now.  And Danny picked out another one.  He does a lot of these where he's changing the shape of clouds.  And is this the one, the hole shaped cloud?  Yeah.  This is the one we haven't played yet, right?  You should change the shape of his head with a fucking shotgun.  I hate this cunt. 
[02:34:30]  You're annoyed by him.  I hate him.  Into a thundercloud.  I hate him.  I hope he's looking at a cloud and he doesn't see the fucking, the gas truck.  Nice 18-wheeler filled with gas.  Were you here for square shape cloud?  No.  Last week you weren't?  No.  That one is the classic.  Oh, really?  That's the one that started it all, but he has other videos where he's trying to change  the shape of the clouds by honestly just talking to it.  And here's another one where there's a hole shaped cloud.  Oh, boy.  H-O-O-L. 
[02:35:00]  If you want to play along at home.  This video is being recorded by T-Chase.  I'm recording this in September 2011.  This is a psychokinesis weather control video by T-Chase where I'm able to control clouds and wind.  In this case, I'm going to try to attempt to make holes in the cloud by psychic energy. 
[02:35:30]  See, I'm training the camera now on this cloud.  You can see more on my website on this, but I'm going to try to make a hole in this cloud by psychic power as you watch.  Make a hole in this cloud.  I'm looking at here now.  H-O-L.  Make a hole in the cloud.  Make a hole in the cloud. 
[02:36:00]  I'm going to try to make a hole in this cloud.  Make a hole in the cloud.  Enligent the hole in the cloud.  I've got to stop this for a second.  The face that Jimmy's making.  You don't like this guy, do you?  I've never wanted a bullet to tear through somebody so badly.  He's kind of funny, though.  I'm enjoying it.  A hole in the cloud.  You've got to hear a square shape.  A lot of these videos are up on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  Like us, motherfuckers. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, what the hell?  Enligent the hole in the cloud.  The cloud.  The breathing.  Like a hole in the cloud.  Did he just start sending them to you?  Huh?  Did he just start sending them?  No, Danny found him. 
[02:37:00]  Danny found him?  Honestly, Danny found him, and I truly believe he's the reason why this thing's going viral now.  Oh, yeah?  One of the websites kind of credited us for pushing it forward, absolutely.  Pushing it forward.  Yeah, Guyism is a pretty good website.  What does this guy look like?  I don't know.  Do we know?  I don't think so.  No, it's just audio?  Make a hole in the cloud.  I would say it better.  Yeah?  I knew that was the heart of why you didn't like it.  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  Hole in the clouds.  It's so much fun here.  That's not.  A hole in the clouds.  It doesn't sound as catchy when you say it.  Yeah, it does.  I could shapeshift clouds.  Fuck them.  You don't fuck the clouds.  I just move them.  Boom.  You found your next video.  Yeah.  A hole in the clouds.  Fucking place to crack up.  It's not about cracking up.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Enlarging the hole in the cloud.  Make a hole in the cloud.  Make a hole in the cloud.  Make a hole in the cloud. 
[02:38:30]  What a fucking fool.  Does it work?  Does he actually make a hole?  No, of course it doesn't work.  Some retard voice guy making a hole in the cloud.  How could it work?  Maybe he has a power.  It works.  It does?  Yeah, there's some trickery.  He makes holes come in the cloud?  I believe what he's doing, of course, is...  Of course.  Because the cloud does turn into the shape he's trying to make it turn into.  He fucking films a dumb cloud doing its dumb thing, and then he leaves his camera on and then records the audio. 
[02:39:00]  You never see his face.  That's so cynical.  Yeah, this guy's a piece of shit.  How do you know he's not magic?  There is no magic in this world.  In the cloud.  In the cloud.  In the cloud.  In the cloud.  You think there's magic in this world?  Yes, there's magic that exists.  You do think there's magic in this world?  Yes.  Absolutely.  Wizardry?  Dreaming things and watching them come true?  There's a lot of magic in the world.  I can pull out my zipper and show you some magic. 
[02:39:30]  Give you a fucking face full of magic.  I shaved buttocks.  Oh, jeez.  We can put my elbow in it.  There's the actual video of the hole appearing.  So, see, he's doing it.  Let me see some.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  This guy's a twat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make a hole in the cleat.  It's got 3,000 hits. 
[02:40:00]  It lights in the hole in the cleat.  It lights in the hole in the cleat.  It's an oval, you cunt.  Make a hole in the cleat.  It's a space.  Make a hole in the cleat.  Make the hole grows bigger  Don't you believe in magic?  Make the hole grow larger  Make the hole grows bigger  Make a hole in the cleat  Make a hole in the cleat 
[02:40:30]  I'm starting to hate them  I'm starting to  Make a hole in the cleat  I couldn't hate them more  I got to piss.  He's almost done.  But you certainly can leave.  You're not going to miss anything.  We're stuck waiting  to this damn thing to end.  I think he's really doing it.  You do?  Yeah, he's saying it  and it's happening.  There is a hole in the clue. 
[02:41:00]  Make a hole in the clue.  Make a hole in the clue.  Make a hole in the clue.  Make the hole grow the clue.  Make a hole in the clue.  It really works.  I lose his voice there.  He's got the whooping cough.  God, I wish he had the whooping cough.  He's talking in tongues.  Yep.  Don't you believe in magic?  Don't you ever dream things  and watch them come true the next day?  No. 
[02:41:30]  Never?  I believe in positive thinking.  I believe you can fucking wire your brain  to fucking do some amazing shit.  To make stuff happen.  But is that magic?  It's dealing with the forces.  I believe that  I'm suspicious that  you talk to dead people while you sleep.  Ah, which means that there's  some kind of ghost presence.  I'm suspicious of that.  Yes.  I don't know.  I feel, I, I, I've had conversations 
[02:42:00]  and moments with my dead dad  while I was sleeping  and it's just fucking weird.  Yeah, because it feels.  I don't know what it means.  I'm not going to be.  Yes, you do know what it means.  No, I don't want to be a,  I don't want to like be a kook either  because I try to like logically figure shit out.  But I'll have some fucking moments  where I'm convinced I actually had  like an interaction with him.  Absolutely.  So I don't know what that's about.  I don't know.  It's called spirits.  You believe in spirits?  I do.  Are you a religious guy, Tom Papa?  No, I was raised Catholic. 
[02:42:30]  I like, believe it or not,  I like, I like believing.  I do too.  And I really,  I don't like organized religion.  I went to a communion,  first communion this weekend.  Oh yeah.  I know organized.  I love how I,  I know we're doing a bunch of things right now,  but I love how the Catholic church  likes to look at other religions and stuff  and say they're not,  you know,  that they're cults and they're not.  Right.  There was a point at this service this past Sunday  where everyone had their right arm up, 
[02:43:00]  sort of like in the Hitler way,  on an angle.  Yeah.  Toward the,  the first communion people  and they were chanting in a monotone voice.  Right.  I'm like,  how can you say you're not a cult too?  Yes.  That's very culty, isn't it?  It's very culty.  And all the,  you know,  all organized religion,  it all has similarities.  You can treat,  everything that happens in the Catholic religion  can be traced back to an Egyptian religion.  Right.  2,000 years before Jesus.  I mean,  there's a lot of,  but that's all the organizing of something 
[02:43:30]  that I think you feel like you feel like,  you know,  there's a presence of something  that people are trying to get a grip on.  I think I confuse people,  but I do believe in something.  I just don't like the,  how it's wrapped in a nice package  and disorganized religion drives me nuts.  It really does.  Can't figure it out.  And the other thing,  so my niece is officially a Catholic.  She had her first communion.  Yeah.  But she has no choice.  Most people don't have a choice.  No.  Some people are brave enough to go, 
[02:44:00]  you know what?  I was brought up Catholic.  I'm going to turn Jewish for whatever reason.  Right.  Maybe I'm going to marry a Jew.  I just feel like it's,  you know,  it's the better way.  Yeah.  But in general,  people are born and then you're pushed into the religion of your parents.  Of course.  And we're talking about eternity here,  right?  Yeah.  That's a big fucking decision.  So don't you think people should be able to like,  I told my wife,  like,  like,  you know,  it would be like pledging a fraternity.  You look at all the fraternities and see which one you are interested in.  Yeah.  Which one you like.  But I mean,  the whole reason.  But is that crazy to think that people should have a period of time where they could actually 
[02:44:30]  check out a bunch of religions and then feel and see which one is right for them?  Yeah.  My felt,  I,  in a weird way,  I felt sorry for my niece and all the other kids up there going,  holy fuck,  these people never had a choice.  And let's just say the Catholic religion isn't the chosen religion.  Right.  They're fucked.  As far as the eternity thing goes.  It's true.  But I think it's all kind of whacked.  But there is a,  there was something nice about going to a place and hearing somebody other than my parents saying, 
[02:45:00]  you should be nice to people.  Oh,  you should forgive people.  And you should,  you know,  and we're going to help these poor people this week.  Oh,  yeah.  There's all those elements of it.  Yeah.  I like that.  I absolutely,  believe it or not,  I do like all that stuff.  Yeah.  But I think religion aside,  I dream stuff all the time and then it happens the next day.  Yeah.  That's,  I think there's,  there is that thing.  What do you mean?  Like,  like I'll see something in my dream and then you'll see it the next day.  And then see it the next day.  You're a fucking movie waiting to happen. 
[02:45:30]  It's never good stuff.  It's never like,  uh,  you know,  I saved someone from a burning fire or something,  but it'll be something like,  uh,  you know,  I saw this,  like a dog almost get hit by a car or something.  You know what I mean?  Like little things like that.  You'll see that the night before.  Yes.  Wow.  You know,  that never happens to you.  You're either really crazy or,  or we got something here or you dream something.  And then like about somebody and then they call you the next day.  He dreams stuff.  And then it happens the next day. 
[02:46:00]  Tom.  Yeah.  You think he's kooky?  Doesn't that happen to you sometimes?  Yeah.  Except it happens first and then I dream it.  And you just switch it around in your head.  That's what happens.  But he says like a dog getting hit or something.  And then the next day a dog almost gets hit or whatever you said.  Don't you have like people in your life that you,  no,  you think about and they call or you think of their thoughts or.  Yeah.  Is that a coincidence?  Yes.  Because what happens is how many people do you think about that don't call? 
[02:46:30]  It's the majority of them.  But when they do,  it's like,  Oh wow.  How many things do you dream that don't happen?  The majority of them.  Yes.  But when something does happen,  it's like,  Oh yeah,  we look at something as a premonition.  When in fact,  just statistically things are going to happen that you dream of.  I mean,  there's weird things,  I guess.  Stuff happens.  There's a little magic to it and you can't explain it.  Yeah.  I believe we don't know everything.  Not even close.  Are we keeping you awake rolling?  The panda has passed out. 
[02:47:00]  Ooh.  Nothing makes you feel worse when doing a radio show than when you look over  and someone's sleeping,  sleeping and sweating profusely.  Right.  It's rolling.  You're right.  You look sick again.  Are you getting sick too?  Allergies.  So you took an allergy pill again?  Yeah.  That's the first thing people say when they don't want to believe that  they're sick.  It's just allergies.  Yeah,  but Tom sees stuff and then it happens the next day.  I do.  Hmm.  It happens a lot.  Look at little things. 
[02:47:30]  Like?  Just little stupid things.  Like if,  like you had a cup of coffee today and you dreamt it last night?  Holy shit.  Holy shit is right,  Sam.  I'm right.  I'm right.  Yes.  That happened,  right?  Yes.  It's getting spooky in here.  So what?  You had a coffee.  Big fucking deal.  There was,  Papa,  there was a moment.  I'm going to bring it up again because I've been paying attention and it hasn't happened  since.  I know what you're going to say.  And only me and Sam saw it because at the time Jimmy and Ant were looking down or something. 
[02:48:00]  Me and Ant were talking about our dead dad.  Oh,  our Jimmy.  There's a spirit for you.  Lord.  Take in that spirit.  Come on,  don't do that.  You're going to get Tom sick.  Yeah.  What do you think of that spirit?  That's a dead spirit.  The dead is risen.  There you go.  There's your magic right in your fucking face.  Exactly.  That's me pushing out the bad spirit.  Enjoy the magic that's in the room right now.  Let that fight out with your white magic.  Oh man, 
[02:48:30]  it's lingering.  Holy fuck.  It hit over here.  It's just Sam sprayed that nonsense.  It's like a terrorist attack.  What are you eating,  Jimmy?  I don't know.  Between the whooping cough and his whooping ass.  It's my vitamins.  It's from the C-Pap of the day.  It pushes all the air through.  It's just pushing all the...  My stomach's hurting right now badly.  I had Chunky Monkey last night.  Tell me the scary thing.  Obese primate.  I ate half a fucking...  I had to like just stop.  You just went nuts?  Ben and Jerry's Chunky Monkey. 
[02:49:00]  Did you go out and buy it or was it in the place?  I went out.  Me and my son went to the fucking supermarket and I got some Chunky Monkey.  Did he like it?  Good for you.  He loved it.  Were you watching a romantic comedy while you ate it?  Well,  I bitched that I needed to sleep badly.  And we needed to get my son to sleep badly.  So what did I do?  I got a Chunky Monkey and me and him fucking went to town on the damn thing.  And then I go to sleep and I'm wondering why I'm wide the fuck away, squeezing my hands  as tight as I can.  And then like my wife brings him in around midnight like, thanks a lot. 
[02:49:30]  He's a wreck too.  Oh man, wired.  Wired.  It's horrible parenting.  Fucking wired.  I love the squeezing the hands.  Oh yeah.  That sugar rush where you just got to clench everything.  Oh, it's totally the scary thing that happened.  So me and Ant were talking about our dead dads and really just joking about it and fucking  having a good time.  And then I just go, yeah, you know, we don't believe they know that we're successful now. 
[02:50:00]  Like Ant's father never lived to see Ant actually make something of his life.  So we were talking about all that.  Like, you know, and the people that say, oh, he knows.  They know.  My relatives try to make me feel good with that.  And I appreciate they're trying, but I'm like, really?  It's a nice gesture.  Nice gesture.  So then out of nowhere I go, oh, really?  If you know and you know what's going on right now, give us a fucking sign.  And at that point Ant was looking at a pal talking something.  Jimmy might have been on his phone, whatever. 
[02:50:30]  They weren't really in the moment.  All of a sudden the lights went down and up.  See?  And Sam saw it.  He's my fucking witness.  It was the craziest shit I ever saw.  It was right when I said it, Tom.  And then I'm like, okay, who's fucking with us?  Who has control of the lights?  They're doing it in the other room or something.  Yeah.  And, you know, no one has come forward to this day.  Maybe they want me to still think this.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's what I keep telling you.  I don't know.  I know.  But it did happen.  And Sam's eyes got met huge. 
[02:51:00]  Like, what the fuck was that?  I believe, look, whenever stuff like that happens, it's so easy to say it's all bullshit.  It's so easy to say that it, but that, they don't know the truth anymore than maybe something  did happen.  I'll tell you what happened.  One time I was doing a seance with people as a goof and there was toast in the toaster  and it popped up and went, hey, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha, he's  tired.  That's funny.  We did seances and shit growing up. 
[02:51:30]  That shit was the Ouija board shit.  The Ouija board.  Yeah.  Captain Howdy.  How's the Ouija board moving like that?  No, I get the fuck.  No, thanks.  I know exactly.  But everyone just decides to start moving in the same direction?  I don't know.  No, it's a little weird.  But like I said, I don't know.  You don't know.  Fuck yeah.  But that day where the lights flickered, and to this day, they have never flickered again  because then I'm thinking, all right, it was a coincidence and there was some kind  of surge or something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's never done it again, right?  Fucking Ouija board.  My mother and I were in my house.  A friend of mine died. 
[02:52:00]  It was in college.  And you're talking to him on the Ouija board?  No.  I talk to like all kinds of people.  He always wore this Yankee cap, like this hard helmet that I had, and he would always  wear it.  Sure.  So he got killed.  He was shot.  Why?  Yeah, he was shot.  Why?  So I came home from school.  What was he doing?  That night.  He was going to a concert, and he just stopped in Irvington, New Jersey, and just stopped 
[02:52:30]  for some food, and then they found him in a parking lot.  Shot.  Holy fuck.  How old?  Nineteen.  Holy shit.  These one robbed him?  No.  Wallet on him.  Everything.  Really?  Just randomly shot.  Think it was a sexual encounter?  No, I think it was just a random gang thing, maybe.  Just popped this guy.  I don't know.  I shot a bunch of people.  So we always wear this Yankee hard hat.  That's when we first met.  He had this batting helmet, and he would always come over and wear this thing.  So I come home.  I come into the house. 
[02:53:00]  We're talking about how he died and all this stuff.  My mother and I are alone in the house, and all of a sudden we just hear this bang upstairs.  We go upstairs.  The Yankee hard hat.  I have these shelves in my old bedroom.  It was up on that shelf.  We hear this bang.  We go upstairs.  The Yankee helmet that he used to wear is just spinning.  Everything fell off the shelf, and it's just spinning on the hardwood floor.  You should probably be more careful with that.  Random, yes.  Anything can happen, yes. 
[02:53:30]  But I choose to believe otherwise.  Was there work going on in your house right now?  Nothing.  Quiet house.  Probably a mad fan of something.  Missing the point of the story altogether.  Fucking Yankee.  It's not a sports story.  It's not before he said you should probably be more careful with it, like you were trying  to get to the point that it fell.  Should have used to.  I'd be on the Ouija board, and people would be just fucking demons. 
[02:54:00]  What do you mean?  Name me a band of sick fucking puppies.  You got that from a Ouija board?  Yeah, demons.  No bullshit.  Are you guys hard?  Fuck yeah, man.  So hard with like tail rocks.  How heavy is their music?  So heavy, only the devil can lift it.  Why is he doing this?  Chip is really rude.  I thought we were friends.  What are you doing?  I forgot how heavy he rocks.  Dave on Long Island.  Dave.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, listen.  You guys are talking about weird things with you. 
[02:54:30]  You both did that.  You got to check out Teresa Caputo, the Long Island medium, man.  I prefer Extra Lodge.  Well, my sister loves this broad.  I guess it's a new show on where?  I think it's a learning network or something.  She's the Long Island medium, and she looks like a typical Long Island broad.  She was in here, and she freaked out all the people on Shade 45.  Really?  Of course she was.  Yeah.  Well, she was on time.  She did Sway Show, and I was talking to some of the people who do Sway Show afterwards, 
[02:55:00]  and they were like, no.  This is some fucked up shit.  You know what?  Sometimes you don't want to know, but at the same time you do.  I mean, you sound like you were pretty close to your dad.  So, I mean, I think it would be a fucking good experience for you guys.  Well, I offered up a creepy story on Ron and Fez.  It's a whole number 11 story.  It's too long.  I really don't feel like doing it today.  And John Edwards was sitting there.  Uh-huh.  So, I'm like, oh, John Edwards.  I'm going to tell him my 11th story. 
[02:55:30]  I'd never told it on the radio.  It was really creepy.  We've seen 11 a lot.  I'll just give you the basic version.  When we were fired, saw 9-11 a lot after the fact.  So, it's not that big of a stretch.  And I asked my dad about it.  He's like, I don't know.  You know, my dad really believed that you could communicate with people from beyond and stuff.  And he goes, maybe those are the people trying to basically say, don't forget us when you get back on radio.  Just give me a simple, like, explanation.  I'm like, all right, whatever.  And then I just kept seeing it in 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, all over the fucking place. 
[02:56:00]  My dad ends up in a car accident on August 11th.  And I went to the crash site.  This is just the basic version, which was in front of my house.  It dies in front of my house.  That's terrific.  And I'm looking for a sign, like, anything, like, Dad, fuck anything.  And I'm looking around on the ground, and I see this little piece of paper, which I have to this day.  Maybe I'll tweet it someday.  And I turn it over.  It's on the curb.  And it's 011, and it says, exit check. 
[02:56:30]  What the fuck?  Maybe a coincidence.  I don't know.  No.  It's fucking weird, though, right?  Yes.  And I swear I was on the side of the road going, show me a sign, because I just, I hated that he went out that way.  Yeah.  You know, like anyone who loses someone close.  You want that last conversation or something.  I had a who-gives-the-fuck conversation with him on the phone.  Yeah.  You know, have a good weekend was basically the last thing he said to me or something, you know?  Right.  And also, it's like, 011 exit check.  What the fuck is that? 
[02:57:00]  So I tell this whole story in front of John Edwards.  He's an expert, right?  Yeah.  He wouldn't say a fucking word.  Really?  Not a word.  Why?  I know.  He's a fucking fraud, in my opinion.  Yeah, all the people that sit in his audience, he does his shows.  Apparently, they got to give, like, certain things.  There's, like, three things about themselves that they got to give.  Right.  Yeah.  In the audience.  It's bullshit.  I've heard that.  I've heard that about him.  He didn't have any of his tricks to his disposal.  Uh-huh.  I'm telling this story. 
[02:57:30]  You'd think he would, like, go, oh, fuck, this is a great opportunity for my business.  I got one right here.  Yeah.  Let's talk to your dead dad.  Throw some shit at me live on Ron and Fez, and people would be amazed, right?  The guy didn't say a word.  Go back to the tape.  Or if he did talk, it was very basic.  Oh, wow, that's pretty crazy.  Like, basically stuff you're saying here today.  Nothing.  Because he didn't have anything on it.  He's a fucking phony.  He is funny.  I knew someone who worked on his live show with him, and he said as much.  He said it was just not a great guy. 
[02:58:00]  So, I don't know.  I don't know what I believe with you.  Do you want to get the long-out of the audience?  Once in a while, you get one that finds dead kids, and they take it seriously that they  can find dead kids and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, dude, look into it, man.  It'd be awesome to listen to her on your show.  I mean, especially with you guys in there.  Thanks.  You don't even know she is.  Everybody in there, that would be awesome to have her in there.  Yeah.  That would be great, man.  She'll say things like, I sense you have laws.  Good call.  Shit face.  Have a good day.  Jimmy, feel better, pal.  Thanks, brother. 
[02:58:30]  You know, now I brought it up.  There are two other things with the 11th thing.  So, my best friend flew in from L.A. for the funeral on the week with my dad and stuff,  right?  Uh-huh.  And I was telling him this whole 11th thing, which I was seeing a lot that week, especially.  It's kind of gone away.  I really haven't noticed lately.  And I'm driving him back to the airport.  And I forgot if it was the Southern State Parkway or the L.A. or whatever.  But in the distance was, like, two fucking, like, you know, towers that made the number 11.  So, I was like, see, and there it is again as a joke. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  Just as a joke.  Like, see, it's happening all the time.  You see it, right?  That's 11.  And he laughs.  And I go, I go.  But then I got serious with him for a moment.  I'm like, what the fuck is that?  Is that just a coincidence?  Like, this whole 11th thing I've been seeing for the last few weeks?  And right at that moment, Tom Pop, and I swear to God, a car comes up and gets right in front of us.  The license plate was a vanity plate that said, it's a clue.  Swear to you.  No.  I could call up this guy right the fuck now. 
[02:59:30]  And then takes off.  Both our hair stands up like, what the fuck?  And then I try to speed up to make sure that's what it said.  And we couldn't catch up to the fucking car.  It was like it came right in front of us.  It's a clue.  And then took off.  Sure, it wasn't Voss's car.  It said, Jill.  It's a joke.  I'm telling you, I choose to believe that that stuff means something.  This good friend of mine, he's an atheist.  He doesn't believe in shit, right?  It's easy to not believe. 
[03:00:00]  Which is fine.  And he travels around at the time for his job.  And I forget.  It was probably maybe a month later.  He calls me up.  He goes, I got to fucking talk to you.  I'm like, what, man?  He goes, I flew into St. Louis.  I think it was St. Louis, because maybe we could even look this up.  And the guy from the local company there picks him up and goes, hey, I'm going to take you  out for some food and drinks.  And you're going to really love this place.  I think he said it was a sports bar at the time.  And my friend goes, really?  Cool.  What's the name of it?  And the guy goes, Eleven. 
[03:00:30]  I don't know.  Yes, you do know.  I don't know.  Yeah, you do.  I don't want to just say I know.  But it's weird.  It is weird.  But what are the odds?  Exactly.  A place in St. Louis?  Eleven?  Exactly.  No, there's something to that.  My dad, I mean, if he did have it, some weird powers, you know, wherever the fuck, he would  love to fuck around with my friend there.  Right.  Yeah, because, oh, really?  I don't believe?  Watch what I do from where I'm at now.  And then it stops after a while, right?  Yeah, I haven't really seen the Eleven thing lately. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they're messing around in the beginning.  I think it's just because you stopped seeing it.  Your eyes are closed.  I'm very tired.  I'm a total cynic with that stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  We should get to Long Island TV in the year.  I wish I was wrong.  I hope I was wrong.  But what about the people the FBI hired to find missing kids and stuff?  They take that pretty seriously.  Yeah, no, I know, I know.  I don't have an explanation.  What's her name?  The Brown lady?  The what?  Sylvia.  Sylvia Brown?  Sylvia. 
[03:01:30]  Or the one that...  They take her pretty seriously.  Or the one that predicted that Kennedy was going to be shot that weekend?  Oh, that's nonsense.  Gene Dixon stinks.  What's that Gene Dixon?  Everyone hated him in Dallas.  I could have guessed.  Because then we've had Kreskin on the air, and he's the biggest fucking phony.  Yeah.  Oh, is he brutally bad?  He's almost a hack at it.  Yeah.  Really bad.  Look, if anyone does have that ability, it's nothing you can control.  James Randi, I think his name is the Amazing Randi.  I love the Amazing Randi.  He's offering a million dollars to anybody who can prove to him beyond a doubt that there 
[03:02:00]  is this psychic activity.  He cannot find one bit of proof with a blank million dollar check on the table.  Yeah.  It's too elusive.  You can't prove it.  But maybe the people realize he's not good for it, so they don't try.  It's just, I think the easiest thing in the world is to say, no, that it doesn't exist.  But it's also, like, I want it to exist.  I really do.  But I understand what it is in us that makes it want to exist. 
[03:02:30]  Yes.  It's our fear of mortality and of being non-existent.  We want to think that there is the consciousness we know now after.  So the idea of believing in things that further that thought makes sense.  Mm-hmm.  Or it's a presence of something inside you that's unknowable and that you feel and you  can't explain.  Yeah.  You know what?  When you look at space and all that shit, it's like, really?  Demons are just hanging out and people coming back going, boo-boo. 
[03:03:00]  No, not demons.  But I think when you look at space, the idea of energy, transferring energy all the time,  this constant energy, kind of makes a lot of sense.  Right.  I mean, I like Russ here in Buffalo.  He goes, seeing the number 11 everywhere is like when you buy a new car and see it everywhere  afterwards.  Could be.  Mm-hmm.  Somehow that 11 popped in my head.  And so then every time I saw it, I went, oh, fuck, there it is again.  Right.  So, yeah, I don't know.  I guess Ron and Fez talked to the Long Island medium and it was horrible.  Of course it was. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, really?  And then they got a guy on the line that says he saw a ghost of his dead mother.  You want to go to that one real fast?  Sure.  Josh in Texas.  Josh.  Hey, Opie.  What's going on?  Hey, buddy.  How are you, man?  Hey, I was listening that day that a light flickered on your dad.  And I, too, used to see my dad whenever I was a kid.  He died when I was 12.  And I would see him in a dream and we would talk. 
[03:04:00]  And he would give me life advice and stuff.  But I lost my mom when I was 20.  And now I believe in Jesus.  And so I prayed one night to see my mom one last time.  And, yeah, I saw her in a dream.  And she opened the door in my bedroom.  And I looked up and there she was.  And so she just smiled at me.  And so I went to go follow her. 
[03:04:30]  And as soon as I left my bedroom, I could just see her around in the corner of the hallway.  So I ran down the hallway.  And just as soon as I got to the end of the hallway, I could see her around in the corner into the kitchen.  And I chased her throughout the whole house.  And by the time I finally got to where there was nowhere else she could go, she was completely gone.  Of course she was.  Jimmy's annoyed by you.  No, no, no.  I'm not annoyed by it.  I mean, I'm not annoyed by it because I know he believes it. 
[03:05:00]  Why wouldn't she just stand there for a second if she made all the effort to appear?  It's not that you just watched the shining.  And she would have the upper hand if you got scared and started throwing shit at her.  Oh, dude, I was scared of her than shit.  I woke up scarier than a motherfucker.  Right.  You were probably dreaming, sir.  We're half asleep.  Ah, well, now, I talk to my father all the time in dreams.  And so that's kind of what I was doing was trying to get one last conversation with my mom before, you know. 
[03:05:30]  Why are we allowed to dream?  Why can't our bodies completely shut down when we sleep?  Is there a reason why we dream?  I don't know.  Huh?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I can't feel my liver right now.  I don't know what it's doing.  So why can't your brain be shut down while you're sleeping?  Because I don't know.  Well, it's got to do all those doodads and knickknacks. 
[03:06:00]  Why are we allowed to dream?  And why are we just, like, taking it for granted?  Is there something to it?  I don't know.  It's constantly...  See, Tom, my book's going to be called, I Don't Know.  I think there is something to it.  I mean, if you look in the Bible about Joseph, the story of Joseph, and all the dreams that he interprets, you know, there's seven skinny cows and seven fat cows.  And the dream that Pharaoh dreams about these cows is interpreted by Joseph as there will be seven years of famine and seven years of plenty. 
[03:06:30]  And pretty much Joseph saves the whole country of Egypt because he is able to interpret dreams.  And the Bible, I have issues with, because it was written and put together 300 years after Christ died.  They voted on what stories to put in, so a lot of it's edited.  By men.  Yeah.  All right, Josh.  Bye, Josh.  Take care.  My dad was a big fan of trying to find the other shit that wasn't in the Bible and stuff. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, yes.  He really liked studying, like, ancient religions and stuff.  Yeah.  Joseph Campbell.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Related to Glenn.  Campbell soup.  What's he eating?  Soup or something?  No, I mean, it really shows that every religion is the same.  Sam in Texas, my friend's murder was solved by a psychic.  Okay.  Let's listen to this one.  And can you prove this there, Sam?  The psychic did it.  Let me prove it.  What happened, bro? 
[03:07:30]  You can Google it.  The murder case is Andre Daigle, D-A-I-G-L-E.  Hold on.  Let's do it.  And he's from New Orleans.  And the psychic medium lady that solved his murder was a lady named Rosemarie Kerr.  Uh-huh.  Anyway, it's one of the horror stories that all of us guys have.  Well, what happened?  The bar.  He went out to a bar and had this chick that was hitting on him. 
[03:08:00]  So he went ahead and told his buddy that he was going to leave with her and ended up she was setting him up for a murder with her boyfriend and one of his friends.  They just wanted to kill somebody for just to see what it was like.  Wow.  And they hadn't seen him for a long time, so his sister took a picture of him to the psychic.  And if you read the story, it was on Discovery Channel or Biography, I think.  Anyway, you read the story, the psychic told his sister to have all of his friends gathered. 
[03:08:30]  And I wasn't there.  I was living in Texas, not Louisiana.  So anyway, had all of his friends gathered.  She called the house and said, y'all need to go across Lake Pontchartrain right now.  And so the friends drove across the lake.  And as soon as they took the exit that the psychic told them to take, they saw his brother's pickup with his murderers driving down the road.  Come on.  And so that can be coincidence, too. 
[03:09:00]  Maybe she was just driving around.  She told them where to go.  Wow.  She probably saw the car.  That's what I'm saying.  She probably did.  Like Jimmy said, she probably did the murder.  Yeah, she was the one in there tootsing it up.  But for real, I mean, it's one of those cases that's kind of freaky.  And I didn't know he was dead until I saw the show on TV.  And I went, holy shit, when he said his name, I jumped up.  So I guess you're not psychic.  I just don't like these psychics that, you know, they get vague signals. 
[03:09:30]  It's like, really?  Yeah.  Is it a signal or not?  Anytime it's on multiple shows.  They're such assholes.  Why can't the psychic just go, hey, I hear your thing is going on.  Whoa, whoa, good point.  Hey, I'm sensing.  Did you have a what?  Fuck.  I'm seeing the number five.  Have you suffered a loss?  It's, yeah, like every other two-legged creature on this planet, you dummy.  Do you have a relative with the letter J? 
[03:10:00]  No, I don't.  You're in a house.  You're in a house.  You used to live in a house.  If you're in those situations, don't answer anything.  Right.  All right, keep going.  It's so hard.  Just go and keep going.  Especially with Google and everything now.  Because all of a sudden someone goes, yes, my nephew's middle name is Jerry.  I'm sensing a Jamie.  My name is Jim.  Aha.  Jamie, Jim.  Yeah, you get the J right.  One of 26 shots.  Fucking cunt.  Yes, yes.  And the people that are getting their readings, they want to believe so bad, so they're willing 
[03:10:30]  to offer up this nonsense.  Absolutely.  So if you really want to do one of these readings, sit there and go, okay, what else you got?  Don't, don't, you don't have to answer anything.  She's trying to figure it out, right?  You so crave any contact.  You crave it.  Right.  You know, so any, you're willing to believe a lot more.  Right.  And you, and you push it along too.  Right.  You start to bend it.  Right.  Of course.  Can I address someone?  On the, on the Twitter?  Yeah, Will Stone 1420 writes, hey, Jim Norton, when you lose someone close to you in your life, 
[03:11:00]  you're willing to believe anything.  Don't be such a cunt.  And he capitalized it.  How about this, stupid?  What do you think?  I've never lost anybody in my life?  You think that's a unique experience?  You fucking dummy.  I just don't believe that some fat lady with a bouffant hairdo is going to summon my dead  friend to tell me secrets from beyond.  I wish it were true.  Yeah.  But you're not willing to believe anything.  Yeah.  Don't be stupid.  Just fucking, what we got to do is realize what it is. 
[03:11:30]  It sucks.  It's painful.  And deal with it.  Any Patrice sightings?  Anyone?  No, I've dreamt about him a lot.  Yeah.  A lot of Patrice dreams.  Yeah.  They're miserable.  Maybe he's trying to talk to you.  No, it's just me missing him.  You don't know.  It's me missing my dumb friend.  Yep.  Yep.  It's true.  They're very miserable dreams, too.  They're awful.  Is he ever nice?  I'm just sad in them.  I'm more saying things to him.  I'm just miserable in them.  Right.  All right.  Well.  It's been, I, look, it's so, it's fun to believe that there might be ghosts and there might 
[03:12:00]  be people visiting us in our dreams and you might be able to dream stuff and have it  come true and you might be able, for me, it just feels like a lot more wonderful to  kind of live in that little crazy world than just in a, in a dark, bleak place.  Watch what I do right now.  Everyone think of a number between one and ten.  427.  Between one and ten. 
[03:12:30]  Got the number?  Got it.  Want to say hi to everyone that picked the number seven?  That's the most common one.  Yeah, I didn't pick that because I knew you were going to say that.  Nope.  Nope.  I'm not talking to you guys.  I was talking to the listeners.  There are people fucking amazed all over America and Canada right now.  How about this?  They're amazed.  Pick a number between one and a million and I'll guess it.  All right, I got one.  Got it.  427,618.  Oh my God!  Exactly.  That is scary.  Holy shit.  You thought it too? 
[03:13:00]  That was my thing.  I thought it too.  That happened to me one time.  I was guessing at a seance.  I'm like, everybody had written a number ten.  Did you read that thing?  Fucking devilish.  Yeah, I picked things out of Ouija boards.  No, you don't.  Shut up.  I can't believe I drank Jim's backwash.  Yeah, with good lucks in it.  Yeah, have fun with the flu.  I don't have the flu, but I'm very achy and sore.  Do the unexpected this year for Mother's Day instead of the usual flowers or cards.  Well, I think you got to get a card no matter what.  Have to.
