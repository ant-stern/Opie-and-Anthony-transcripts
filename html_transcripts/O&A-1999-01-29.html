Yeah you see the new issue of playboy.  I haven't even really shown you yet Anthony when we had all the members of kiss in the  studio they were talking about how playboy was going to do something called the girls  of kiss.  Bunch of girls naked with kiss makeup on it and remember we begged the band to please 
[00:30]
 send us a copy when it gets out there.  Yeah well they sent us a copy there it is our own personal copy from kiss themselves.  Those girls are the girls of kiss.  My Lord if you're walking by a newsstand you've got to check this out.  Got to look at that.  Get all the members of kiss just swarmed with girls completely naked with kiss makeup on.  Looks kind of bizarre doesn't it.  It does look bizarre. 
[01:00]
 It's so damn hot though.  There's some real nice looking ones in there.  Look at it.  Look at Ace freely.  Does he even know that he's hanging out with a bunch of naked girls in that picture.  Look at that.  Look at Paul.  Does he care.  What are you trying to say today.  I'm saying does he care.  I don't know.  All right.  Look at it.  Look at Ace though.  He's just so out of it.  Hey look around.  Those girls are naked man.  Look around.  Oh man. 
[01:30]
 There's a cool shot.  Some shots of girls in the front row at a kiss show all completely topless.  That's a hot shot too.  So you shouldn't hand this to us just as we're going on.  I know because now we're distracted.  The whole first break is ruined here.  But trust me you're walking by a newsstand.  You got to check it out.  It's a playboy.  The girls of kiss.  I'm not even sure if it's on the newsstands yet.  And Ralph said this one girl right here was just OK.  Well you're a little. 
[02:00]
 You're a little crazy with that girl.  Crazy.  All right.  If you get the kiss issue.  There's a bunch of girls around Peter Chris.  All right.  Just past the pictures of the kiss concert and the girl to the far left.  Those are the best breasts I've ever seen in my damn life.  Everyone has different opinions.  And I said Ralph.  I don't know.  Aren't those the best breasts you ever seen?  Is that what you say Ralph?  OK.  They're OK.  How can you say they're OK?  And then Opie said that Ralph must be a homo. 
[02:30]
 Better than OK.  Well we're a lot better than OK.  All right.  Which ones would you go for Ralph?  I'm quite happy with the ones I have.  Thank you.  Well this is fantasy.  I think your wife can handle you talking about another woman.  Ralph.  Look at that.  He's in that position.  He is.  Even though I know your wife's listening.  Kathy don't listen to this.  Come on.  It's fantasy land.  Which which press would you point out?  Which ones.  Yeah.  Which ones are like you realize you're getting me in serious.  I know.  Oh my God.  You can't even point to ones you think would be attractive.  This is fantasy world. 
[03:00]
 I see.  I look like Mrs. T.  So.  Oh my God.  Come on.  All right.  That one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty hot right there.  He's pussy whipped.  Come on.  She knows we're just having fun.  Right.  Yeah.  We put you in a bad position every day.  At least you didn't curse this time on our show.  We appreciate that.  You haven't shut the mic off yet.  He's got to shut off the mic.  We're in trouble.  That's so funny.  I got a little flack when I got home the other night from Jen. 
[03:30]
 Remember the girl that called up and said that she had been going out with the guy  for about eight weeks and she had finally decided to give him a hammer.  Yes.  And it was going to be the first time she described how she was going to do it.  They usually sit down and make out and he gets to second base as it were.  And she was going to finally reach over and undo his pants and start.  And we were all just freaking out.  And the way.  Yeah.  Because you remember what that's like.  You know, and I was just sitting here, I guess, drooling and moaning and groaning.  So I get home and Jen's like, so did you, uh, how long just stay on the phone with 
[04:00]
 your girlfriend?  Like, oh, my girlfriend.  I can only wish a girlfriend like that.  Oh, please.  It's just memories.  Yeah.  So I guess I was being a little too, uh, over, hopefully excited on the phone.  When you start dating a new woman and that happens for the first time, there's, there's  nothing better in the entire world.  I'm eating that.  There's no drug that's better.  There's, there's nothing.  I was just trying to like totally get into the whole mindset there because she was saying 
[04:30]
 the guy has no clue this is going to happen.  Like they hadn't talked about it.  And remember that when you're dating and all of a sudden you have five or six going  down, you have five or six dates, you're watching a, you know, some movies and stuff  and you get to second base and you just know every time you try for third, you're going  to get shut down.  Go try to go for the patch.  She's going to make that that Kung Fu maneuver.  Your ladies with your hands.  It's amazing what you guys could pull off.  But you know, it's funny.  I remember this one. 
[05:00]
 What are you doing?  Oh, like all of a sudden you're like, should I go for it?  So, okay, we're in that throws a passion here.  It's gotta be the right time.  You know, so you go to make the move and the guy goes,  What are you doing?  And it's just like, oh, man, I felt it.  It was perfect.  Shut out again.  I just like now that the whole scheduling gets pushed back another couple of weeks,  it is a mess.  And you don't and you ladies don't understand the stress you put us through because we're 
[05:30]
 not sure if it's the right time to make the move.  Are we going to get shut down?  You don't know.  You just don't mind boggling every time you go out on the date.  It's like, is this going to be the time?  Do I try it?  Do I not?  And she knows she totally knows all the power in the world.  You know, as much as given it, you ladies, I love you.  Got all the power.  Yeah.  All right.  So we're ready to rock here, right?  It's after you Friday.  Let's just get out of the way. 
[06:00]
 A big FU to anyone that supports cop killers.  Thank you.  Yeah, enough discussion on that.  People showed up there.  A ton of instant feedback and faxes and phone calls on that.  So let's just get that one out of the way.  You support a cop killer.  A big FU to you.  FU.  All right.  The facts line for the rest of the FU is 212-957-WNEW.  And of course, if you're online right now, use the instant feedback.  We love feedback when we're doing our radio show.  Just click on our pictures through the WNEW website and you could throw an email,  write us here in the studio. 
[06:30]
 All right.  Look at that.  I just updated it.  Yeah.  It's a scandal.  Look at it.  All of a sudden, an FU, I guess, to Ralph.  A big FU to that pushy, whooped bastard who's scared to look at Playboy because his wife  might get mad at him.  Thanks, Jay.  Jay from Jersey.  Look at that.  Throwing an FU Ralph's way.  That's cool.  See, we can update this immediately.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, Days of the New and the Downtown.  A little band from Kentucky doing quite well for themselves. 
[07:00]
 I think they're finally of age, that band.  When that CD came out, they were 16 and a half, 17 years old.  And they and I used to buy beer for those guys.  Yeah.  And they were doing shows in Boston.  The last station we worked at, Days of the New, we were one of the first stations that  played those guys.  Now everyone plays Days of the New.  And they played a couple of club gigs for our radio station, but they weren't of age  to drink.  So we'd be backstage and they'd go, could you go out to the bar and grab us some beers? 
[07:30]
 Sure, man.  So, breaking the law.  I think we hold a special place in their hearts.  Yes.  We got them there.  Brew.  All right, man.  It's FU Friday.  Keep the faxes coming, 212-957-WNEW.  And if you want to use the phone line, we'll go there next, 212-757-1027.  Hi, NEW.  Hey, is this Opier Anthony?  Both.  Yeah, what's up?  How are you doing?  Good.  I want to tie in.  I heard Howard this morning and they were talking about you guys.  Really? 
[08:00]
 They didn't mention our show.  They didn't mention our show.  They didn't mention our show, unfortunately.  Right.  But they said they were talking about what you guys were talking about yesterday when  was it Opie got beat up for saying nigger?  Yeah.  Well, the story goes, yeah, when I was young I was really...  Well, I heard it yesterday and this morning I heard it on Howard.  Yeah, well, Big Black, if that s*** sucking mother f***er is listening to our show, give  us credit, you a**hole.  You piece of s***, you f***, you s***.  Oh my God.  Holy s***. 
[08:30]
 Are you guys playing Braw Bingo today?  We need the help around here and if Big Black is going to call Howard with a cute little  story that's going to make everyone laugh, at least, you know, tell her where he heard it.  I know, I know, I know.  Alright, man.  Humorous anecdote.  You guys are doing a great job.  Thank you.  Hey, it's Homer.  Hi.  Hello.  My God.  I've gotten quite a few calls and emails and faxes about that one.  Thanks for, you know, supporting us a little bit, guys.  Man, we're feeling the love when you're paying attention and letting us know about things 
[09:00]
 like that.  Don Stern, you hold all the listeners in your pocket like so many nickels and dimes.  You must let us drink from the well, Don Stern.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  You're on the air.  You're on the air.  Hello.  That delay might be shaking them up.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, you guys.  What's up?  I got a big F-U.  Alright.  I just bought a brand new vehicle.  Yeah.  And you know how you get the loan from the bank? 
[09:30]
 Right.  They sent me the Dalton loan payment booklet one day before the first payment is due.  How's that?  You have an instant late on your record now.  Big mother effing F-U to North Fork Tank.  And while we're on to F-U, big F-U to Caramella.  Ouch.  Alright, we'll get that one out of the way.  Take care, guys.  Make it easy, man.  A lot of people call him with that one today.  I hate that when you get bills or something and it's like due date today. 
[10:00]
 Gee, thanks for the little buffer period here.  Exactly.  Then they rake you for being late.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  I have a big F-U for the governor of St. Louis.  Governor of St. Louis?  Yeah, he communicated that guy is sentenced for death when the pope was there?  Exactly.  Yeah, the pope came and told him that this triple murderer shouldn't be on death row.  Yeah.  And the guy just rolled over because it was the pope and said, okay, we'll give him life 
[10:30]
 in prison.  Incredible.  He killed like some drug partner that he had.  Yep.  But then he killed his wife and his handicapped son.  Can you imagine?  And this guy, and then all of a sudden he finds God in prison.  Of course.  You get a couple of feet of pipe in the keister and you'll find God too.  That's the first step to becoming a Jesus-freaking-in-prison is becoming queen of the weight room prom.  You know?  You guys are great.  Man, I love all of them. 
[11:00]
 The guy you had on yesterday was hysterical.  Oh, we love Lewis Black.  He's great.  He's out of his mind.  We love him.  Yeah, he's going to be pretty much a regular on the show.  Yeah, he's really great.  He really digs coming in here and you can see him on the Daily Show every Wednesday night.  Is he?  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks for checking in.  Have a good day.  All right.  I was laughing my ass off last night thinking about what that caller said about the pope  yesterday.  He said, you know the pope has the big pope mobile?  It's that car with the square glass case that he drives in. 
[11:30]
 It would be funny as hell if as he's driving all of a sudden wind starts blowing and dollar  bills are flying around and he's got to grab them.  He could take that big ass pope.  I have raised for the better for the Lippers.  That was stupid.  Wave.  He's got he's trying to trying to catch the dollars waving like he does with the back  of his hand.  Hello.  Look at the.  So, Peter Anthony, it's a few Friday.  I got to read this fax. 
[12:00]
 It's just so wrong to 12957 W.  Any W. If you want to send a fax.  This is from wacky stacky.  I think a big F you to the makers of wow potato chips.  I almost asked in my pants because I couldn't hold it on the bus.  And when I got home, I blew my first.  It says on the bag it could cause a loosening of the stool.  Yes.  That's what it says.  I know that is so wrong. 
[12:30]
 But I had to read that on the air.  I'm going to get on the back of the ball.  The rock in New York, one of two seven W. Any W. Sweetest thing you do is open Anthony.  It's a few Friday.  We're off to a fine, fine start.  Well, yes, it's your opportunity to vent your week's worth of anger. 
[13:00]
 And we give you the forum right here.  I don't think we've explained the F you concept lately and we're getting new listeners every  single day at this point.  It's pretty good.  We're lucky.  We have a forum all week long to vent our pissed off in this.  And on Friday, we open up the phones and you could call up and what pissed you off this  week?  You know, whether it was your lame ass boss, your wife or husband ragging you, you know,  the mechanic that charged all kinds of cash.  car out of the lot and it's still screwed up. 
[13:30]
 Here's your forum.  Pretty much.  And we put a lot of you guys on on Friday.  We kind of turn the show over to you guys completely on Fridays.  Exactly.  And we got another lady on the line here, Anthony Rachel, I think her name is.  She tried the Hummer technique that we're telling everyone and another satisfied customer  on the line here.  That's great.  Now, I'm stuttering because we've been talking to so many ladies in the last few days and  they just kept me so worked up.  But Laura Korn was in here and she gave a great technique to give a special hummer to 
[14:00]
 your boyfriend or husband.  Yes.  And Laura Korn pretty much guaranteed the ladies that it would be the best hummer you  ever had.  As long as this technique wasn't done on him before you got to him.  It's a tall order, but people are coming through.  Yes.  And the technique again, because there's hundreds of emails from ladies that want to know it.  Oh, well, you blindfold your man.  Of course, he is naked.  And then you have a hot liquid and a cold liquid in two separate glasses. 
[14:30]
 You drink the hot and you start your hummer.  And then that alone would make most guys go crazy.  Then when he's not expecting it, you put the cold liquid in your mouth, place that around  a little bit and then proceed again with the hummer.  And then alternate.  Hot, cold, hot, cold, hot, cold.  And supposedly it just drives guys batty. 
[15:00]
 Absolutely nuts.  Who is that guy?  Do we have a mic on the street again?  I don't know what's happening.  Somebody is getting the technique as we speak.  Yes!  What's his name?  But ladies, if you're using the technique and you got it from us, please tell your man  where you got it from.  We're bribing people to listen to our show at this point.  And what a better way.  There's no better way to get people to listen to the show than to bribe them with sexual 
[15:30]
 favors with the best hum and the lever getting their lives.  So let's talk to Rachel here.  Rachel, I heard you tried the hummer technique.  Uh-huh.  And?  Phenomenal results.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Was the guy just freaking out?  Totally.  Completely.  What did you use?  Actually just hot water.  I didn't even bother with the tea.  Couldn't be bothered with that.  Hot water and then you had another glass with some cold water in it?  And the cubes, a little bit of cubes.  And ice cubes.  Uh-huh.  And you alternated hot to cold.  Uh-huh.  And what happened every time you alternated? 
[16:00]
 What did you do?  Like jumping, like riding around like a fish out of water.  It was unbelievable.  Great!  Did you have him blindfolded too?  Absolutely.  Wow.  That is fantastic.  No doubt.  Did you at least tell him where you got the idea from?  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of set it up.  I said, you know, I heard this thing and I'm going to give it a try.  Oh my God.  Was it the best one he ever had you think?  Oh definitely.  Oh.  Definitely.  Awesome.  See, but now like, you know, now I've got to live up to that.  That's going to be difficult. 
[16:30]
 I think I'm going to have to go buy the book or something.  Yeah, there's a lot of interesting things in Lauren Korn's book.  Absolutely.  All right.  Cool.  We'll pass any new ones on to the listeners also.  Great.  You never know.  Great.  Wow, I'm speechless.  I know.  So is he.  I'm imagining.  I know.  It's just bad.  Didn't you guys have your girls try it on you?  Well, um.  You need to be able to speak from experience.  That's what you need to do.  Yeah.  Experiential learning is the best kind of learning there is.  Can I give you her phone number? 
[17:00]
 Maybe you could talk to her.  Maybe you could call her on Tuesday.  There you go.  I was experiencing an argument.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah, Anthony was experiencing the hot and cold, but it was a different hot and cold.  Yeah.  Oh man.  Well, have a great weekend.  Thank you guys too.  Bye.  Oh, that's great.  Thanks, Rachel.  Yeah.  Hi, honey W. What do you got?  How you doing guys?  I saw the, uh, for your frustrations Friday this morning.  Uh-huh.  Is that lame?  Oh, the best was when they had, uh, what the guy behind the camera, uh, still drumming 
[17:30]
 from the, uh, different strokes.  Talking about him, uh, sorry.  Oh, you're cursed, man.  You're cursed.  That's the S word.  That's the F word.  You're cursed, bro.  You can't use the S word on a radio.  We had to dump out of you.  Oh my goodness.  Well, Anthony, explain what's going on with, uh, Fox and the...  Well, Fox, yeah, they have that Good Day New York in the morning.  And for some reason, like two weeks ago, they just started this, uh, original idea that  they have.  You get to fax in what has pissed you off during the week, and they call it Free Your 
[18:00]
 Frustrations Friday.  If they're going to steal our thing, they can't even go the distance and call it F-U  Friday.  Well, could you picture a Fox News guy sitting there?  It's now F-U Friday.  Oh, well, F-U.  You know, I don't think that would go over well with the Fox exact.  Yeah, but they may, they take our bid and they bastardize it, and now it's all cute  and cuddly.  I know.  Free Your Frustrations Friday every once in a while.  Free Your Frustrations Friday.  Yeah, yeah, so they have that going.  Yeah, you guys should fax, uh, Fox and tell them, you know, come on. 
[18:30]
 You got the idea from Opie and Anthony.  At least get the idea from the Fox News guys.  at Fox and tell them, you know, come on.  You got the idea from Opie and Anthony.  At least give them credit.  Coming up on Fox, it's, uh, uh, Teabag Tuesday.  The Facts Line at Fox, give them hell, 212-717-5849.  Rick's got that, uh, fax number if you need it, all right?  Facts Your Frustrations.  Priceline.com, Anthony.  Yes, I love Priceline. 
[19:00]
 One of our many sponsors on the Opie and Anthony show.  We do love Priceline.com.  The reason I love them, personally, I don't think I've mentioned it lately,  but they saved me $350 on two plane tickets to Florida right after Christmas.  True savings.  Did not know who I was.  I heard William Shatner's on the radio forever.  I needed a flight desperately, so I said, what the hell?  I'll give them a call and see what they can do for me.  And they saved me $350 to fly to Florida.  They quoted me my price that I wanted to pay for a new hair piece. 
[19:30]
 Priceline actually had a hair piece for a price I could afford.  I don't know if they're working hair pieces yet, Mr. Shatner.  Well, since I do the commercials, they'll make some concessions for me.  All right.  Captain James Deeker.  I know that they do flights.  On your primitive airlines, yes.  And I know their latest thing is hotel rooms.  Yes, yes.  Going away in the near future and you need some hotel rooms,  why don't you give them a try and see what they can do for you? 
[20:00]
 If you use their service, they will give you a free hotel night.  You name your price for a hotel room, and then they try to do that for you.  Yes, I want to check up in a hotel with that green woman I was dancing with.  Maybe I could get in touch with...  ...Bisla.  Well, you got a pen. You could write down the number.  Yes, get that for me.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  Sophie and Anthony, FU Friday, in progress. 
[20:30]
 Keep the facts as they're coming.  212-957-WNEW.  Getting a lot of people asking about Dave Matthews and what is going on this coming Tuesday.  My answer to you is, I don't know.  I don't know.  Well, let's just put that up on the board for everyone to read your words.  I don't know.  Where's Roger?  I don't know.  In the hall.  I do know that Dave Matthews is coming in Tuesday. 
[21:00]
 I do know he's playing on Ralph DeToria's show.  Right.  I do know that we want to invite some listeners down.  But besides that, I have no clue what's going on.  Because everybody wants to come down here and check out Dave Matthews on the air.  So maybe Roger could come in to our show a little later on and explain all this for us.  Okay.  Because we really don't pay attention in meetings.  Well, what's going on, right?  I don't know.  I can't sit in these meetings.  We have meetings and I phase out. 
[21:30]
 I start playing with my shoelaces.  I swear, I'm sitting in the chair and the whole time I got my eyes wide open and I'm looking like right at the person that's talking.  And nodding and stuff.  And nodding and stuff.  But all I'm thinking is, oh my God, I'm going to fall asleep.  I can't concentrate.  Well, that's why we got into radio so we didn't have to have meetings.  Like, huh?  And then I put my foot up on my leg and I take my shoelace, that little plastic piece on the end, and I start poking it through the other holes as they're talking. 
[22:00]
 And occasionally I'm like, mm-hmm, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Of course.  Great idea.  No, that's good.  You know?  And then I can't sit in meetings.  We have meetings about meetings at this place.  Yeah.  And then I feel like I've been beat up when I leave them.  I'm all tired.  You guys are sitting there going, you guys have the luckiest job in the world.  Yeah, we do.  But they make it hard.  Yeah, they make it hard.  It's a real basic job, but they make it complicated.  Suits will wreck even radio. 
[22:30]
 Yeah, they put too much effort behind it.  Too much effort and thought.  Yeah.  You know, the other day we had Laura Korn on, we decided to drop all our music and turn it into a talk show for two hours.  This whole place freaked out.  They were calling each other and having meetings saying, is it OK?  Why not?  We haven't tested that.  How well that works with the slide roll.  Is there a research book we could go into to make sure this is OK?  Well, Tennessee, let's go to the 3D BB.  If we cut out all the music, certain listeners will tune away. 
[23:00]
 But others will come in when they hear interesting banter.  And whoopee, you get people listening to the station.  Thank you, Mr. Whoopee.  I mean, yeah, there's a whole thought process behind taking a dump in here.  There's everything.  You need meetings and scheduling this and that.  Like right now, there's someone in an office with a stopwatch going, oh my God, they're talking too much.  What the hell is going to happen?  Someone turn off their mics. 
[23:30]
 Yeah.  Unbelievable.  It should be so easy.  According to our research, Opie and Anthony should only talk 17 minutes an hour.  We've researched this.  We know.  Thank you.  Roger's in the studio.  What's up with Dave Matthews?  Well, he's coming up Tuesday.  He's going to be playing live in the studio with Ralph Show.  And, uh...  Studio.  Ralph Show.  The faithful listeners...  I sign up for this interview.  The faithful listeners know what Roger's all about.  We just invite him in because we like to hear how he talks. 
[24:00]
 It's like Curse.  He was born in Jersey and then raised down south in Atlanta.  It's like some kind of obnoxious accent mix that's like matter, anti-matter, you know?  You can screw everything up.  Just a little too proper for you guys, I know.  Alright.  Now say Gary Hoey for us.  Gary Hoey.  I love that.  Damn, that's funny.  So, opening for Dave Matthews will be the Goo Goo Dolls. 
[24:30]
 Then he'll be here at 1.30 to be playing.  Okay.  And on Monday we're going to be giving out listeners the opportunity to come up to the studio to meet Dave Matthews and hear him play live.  Right.  And so all day Monday...  Are you getting a limo for Dave Matthews?  To pick him up?  To bring him to the studio?  No, actually Carol's going to be picking him up and bringing him in.  Carol.  I don't know that name.  Carol.  Carol.  Oh, no, it doesn't ring a bell.  And so all day Monday listeners are going to have to sing their favorite Dave Matthews song to win an invitation to come up here. 
[25:00]
 Really?  Wacky radio alert.  Alright.  Alright.  Cool.  That sounds fun.  Thanks, Roger.  My pleasure.  We just weren't sure on how that worked.  You didn't say limo though.  No.  He's not coming in a limo.  Alright.  Thank you.  To the studio.  Alright.  Alright.  And speaking of winning, we've got our Super Bowl winner on hold here.  Is this the guy? 
[25:30]
 Rick's handing me the name.  You and I, Anthony, will be at this guy's house.  This is exciting.  On Sunday.  It's Tom from Bayshore.  Let's say hi to Tom.  Tom!  Hello?  It's Opie and Anthony.  No way.  We are coming to your house for the Super Bowl!  No way!  Oh my God.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  I called you guys last night and said, yo, I hope you come to my house.  I want you to bring Stephen Lynch.  Oh, I remember you.  You remember me?  I called you.  I don't believe it.  Are you cool or what?  Oh, we're cool. 
[26:00]
 Don't worry.  We got nothing to worry about.  We're going to have a good party over your house.  We're going to have a great party.  How many people are we bringing?  Well, we could give you a dress out on the air and then we'll get hundreds.  It's up to you.  Oh my God.  It's up to you.  I've never won anything in my life.  I'll give the dress out if you want me to.  No, I don't think I can out that many people.  All right.  We'll give a hint.  It's in Bayshore.  That's all right.  I can't believe it.  My wife is going to kill me.  Are you going to supply the strippers?  Oh, sure.  How many are you going to supply?  That's part of the deal.  If we come to your house for the Super Bowl, you have to supply the strippers.  How many do you need? 
[26:30]
 Six each would be nice.  All right.  I can't believe it.  Oh my God.  Well, congratulations.  We're coming over Sunday.  Great.  What time?  Anthony and I.  And actually, you're really privileged because we're also bringing Ben the Fag and Black  Girl.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  What about Stephen Lynch?  You got to bring him.  We'll see what he's doing.  He might hang with us.  Let's bring him out.  I'll give him a call.  See if he wants to come out.  Beautiful.  All right.  Well, we're going to see you Sunday, man.  Great. 
[27:00]
 What time are you coming?  I don't know.  4.35.  Beautiful.  And we'll stay for the whole game.  Great.  All right.  And we got the 53-inch Sony TV that's going to be hooked up in your house, I think, tomorrow.  Great.  Oh my God.  This is outstanding.  Well, Tom, congratulations.  Thank you.  I guess we're supposed to do something really gay here and say, like, what's the rock  in New York?  But we hate when people do that.  So we have to come up with a cool one.  All right.  A cool one?  Yeah.  Hey, what's the station that sends two DJs over your house that are probably going to  get drunk and puke on your furniture?  Oh, that must be WIW 102.7.  All right, Tom. 
[27:30]
 We'll see you Sunday.  Great.  Take it easy.  Cool.  There goes Tom.  All right.  Looks like we're going to have fun on Sunday.  Yes, it does.  We were pitching a complaint in all week because we were scared that we would get a winner  that wasn't cool.  And we didn't want, you know, a serial killer.  Yeah, a winner that lived in a one room apartment with his mom or something.  Yeah.  But looks like we're going to have fun out there in Bayshore with Tom, the guy.  Cool.  The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW, Def Leppard from Pyro Mania.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[28:00]
 That few Fridays going strong.  I got a quick one here on the instant feedback.  It says, Opie and Anthony, send out the hugest FU to my ex-fiance.  The bastard cheated on me with a 20 year old.  We were together for four and a half years and everything was fine until he met this  girl who had a sob story about being dumped by her fiance because she got pregnant.  I hope he wraps his new truck that I helped him buy around an effing tree.  I hope he's happy with the young psych patient with the kid.  He's an effing weak pussy who can't deal with being responsible. 
[28:30]
 He owes me almost a thousand dollars in repairs to my car and bills.  Like father, like son, I guess.  Thanks.  I love how people are using the word pussy in their everyday conversations.  Well it's an easy way to say something else and not get either in trouble or offend.  It's a fun little word.  Oh, pussy.  I was watching The Godfather 3 last night.  You hate The Godfather 3.  I hate it and I was sitting through some of it though just realizing how much I hated 
[29:00]
 it.  Not even the case but commercials came on for what's coming up.  network.  And they're showing commercials for Basic Instinct.  Oh, speaking of pussy.  Pussy.  With Sharon Stone.  And they're promoing it.  They must have showed the clip where she's ready to uncross her legs, that famous scene  where in the uncut version of the movie she shows, oh, pussy. 
[29:30]
 And it became like the most famous part of the movie.  The announcer with that voice, you know, tonight USA, Basic Instinct, Sharon Stone exposing  it all.  And you know they're not going to show it.  Like USA Network is going to show Gash.  Let's just say it.  That's just like an F-U to USA.  Because they're promoing it like they're going to show it.  They're suckering everyone in.  They're not going to show it. 
[30:00]
 Of course not.  Rent it if you want to see it.  It's not even worth it.  I don't even know what the movie's about anymore.  I just remember that scene.  That's what anyone remembers.  I think the movie was bad.  Yeah, I'm not even sure.  I don't even care.  You can punch that up on the internet.  They got like zoomed in shots of it and everything.  It's just heinous.  I swear to God.  Why is it heinous?  Come on.  Do we have to get into it?  Carefully.  I think we can.  Maybe she should have.  We're all adults here.  Maybe she should have trimmed.  Are you trying to say, Anthony, that Sharon Stone has a 70s Earth Mama momma?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[30:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sharon has a 70s Earth Mama momma.  Look, I don't want to say it was bad, but it kind of looked like Fidel Castro eating  a London broil.  I got to tell you, boy.  Oh my Lord.  Crossing on crossing.  There's a Wookie down there. 
[31:00]
 Wow.  That's all.  But USA isn't going to show it.  Just stop promoing it like that.  Cute little story.  Up next, we got more complaint letters about a Stephen Lynch song.  What a surprise.  Oh, that's Sarkia.  Sorry about that.  Oh, too busy drinking a beer.  What's this one?  Look on the bright side.  When Sharon gets old, she'll look like Don King upside down.  Looks like she's got Phil Donahue's head in a leg lock. 
[31:30]
 All right, enough.  We've reached our quota on Sharon Stone private park jokes.  The Rack of New York 1027WNEW, David Bowie and Rebel Rebel.  It's Ophi and Anthony.  Hello.  And we got to do one of these weather breaks.  What?  We don't do weather on our show.  Okay, what have we got?  Trafficking weather together on the 10.  No, that's PBS.  Oh, okay.  No, no, on the ones is on the ones. 
[32:00]
 What do they say?  Traffic and whether together on the ones.  No, it's traffic on the ones.  What about the weather part?  That's it's always traffic and weather together, isn't it?  You're thinking CBS, but they both do traffic and weather together.  Why don't they gather together?  No, I don't think together.  Okay.  She's now Scott.  Scott is going to come running down here.  Tell us what the deal is.  All right.  And now the WNEW weekend weather check sponsored by the Big Chill on home video. 
[32:30]
 The forecast is.  Let's look.  It's kind of gray.  Chilly.  Kind of cold, right?  I think so.  And gloomy.  Yeah, gloomy.  Gloomy, good, good, gloomy.  Gloomy is a good weather word.  Yeah.  And then the barometric pressure, do we know that?  Does anyone understand?  I don't have an isobar count.  Does anyone understand the barometric pressure when the weather geek says that on TV? 
[33:00]
 Yeah, so when it gets lower, the weather gets lousier.  Yeah, but the average schmo doesn't care or follow that.  Well, there is a low pressure system moving into our area, the counterclockwise circulation,  moving Arctic air, our direction, which should make for a chilly evening.  But this should all move away to make for kind of a partly cloudy weekend.  Really?  Enjoy it.  Back to you, Opie.  This weekend, buy a copy of the Big Chill, the 15th anniversary edition from Columbia 
[33:30]
 TriStar home video.  And when Glenn Close does that shower scene, make sure you openly laugh as loud as you can.  That's my favorite scene in the movie.  Cracks me up every damn time.  In the fetal position on the floor.  God, is that funny?  It's a scream.  All right.  Well, we got some FUs here, Anthony, from Paula from College Point, New York.  What's her problem?  Opie and Anthony, I would like to give a big FU to the despicable bastard who wrote that 
[34:00]
 dumb Kill a Kitten song.  Uh-oh.  P.S. I would like to also give you guys a big FU for playing it.  Paula.  She doesn't like Stephen Lynch's little ditty.  And we got a letter, Anthony, that's supposed to go to management.  Oh, another one.  Just like yesterday.  I don't know how we intercept these damn things, but some veterinarian organization emailed  us yesterday.  Well, this one has nice letterhead.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Look at the it's professionally written.  It's got to and from and CCs and phone numbers and email addresses, everything. 
[34:30]
 This was supposed to go to the boss.  He used word perfect.  So let me read this one to WNEW.  I was shocked and sickened to hear a song called Kill a Kitten recently on your reputable  radio station.  Reputable.  Could be reputable.  Could be repulsive.  I think it is reputable.  Is it reputable or repulsive?  I think it's reputable.  Repugnant? 
[35:00]
 Repugnant radio station.  Sorry about the reputable.  Is reputable even a word?  It is now.  OK.  I was shocked and sickened to hear a song called Kill a Kitten on your lovely radio  station.  How's that?  What is it or was it that you hope to accomplish here?  A bunch of innocent mutilated kittens or puppies?  If you can't find a kitten, I'm sure I don't have to tell you that there are many crazy  listeners out there who will certainly enjoy testing out this song's how to. 
[35:30]
 Of course.  Whereas I am not an animal rights activist, I am a loving and caring pet owner.  I also give much of my spare time, which isn't much, to an animal hospital caring for other  people's pets and comforting the owners when their pets are sick and dying or have died.  These precious little creatures bring so much joy and happiness to many people and I find  it deplorable that any W could even think of playing such a horrific song.  Obviously, you are not pet owners.  Obviously, yes.  But if by some chance you are, I feel very sorry for your kittens and puppies. 
[36:00]
 Thank you for your time.  I would welcome any response via my email address.  Susan from New York, New York.  Well, Anthony, I think we should put this aside over here so we could hand that over  to the boss after the show.  It should go into the file of very, very important letters that we've gotten.  Well, that file's right over here.  Okay, you could file that, right?  Yes.  There we go.  That's good.  Put it in the proper...  There it is.  Yeah. 
[36:30]
 You know what?  I should have gen tape someday.  Me being an idiot with my cat.  You know?  You don't even have to explain yourself.  No, no, I'm not.  I'm just saying it's funny that they say, you know, you're probably not a pet owner  and if you are, I feel sorry for your animals.  It's like, JD, hey, come here, boy.  I'm all nice to my cat.  You bitch.  We're both pet owners but we also have a sense of humor.  Yeah, like anyone's going to hear the words to that song and start killing cats. 
[37:00]
 So this is something new on our radio show, Anthony.  When someone complains about a bit, we play the bit.  Play it.  Simple as that.  If you stop writing your stupid letters, then maybe we'll put the bit aside for a while,  okay?  But here's Stephen Lynch and the Kill a Kitten song that everyone is talking about lately.  All right?  Okay, my favorite part is the part about trying to feed your kitten cocaine.  Cocaine?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's my favorite line.  Yeah.  Do you have a favorite line in this song? 
[37:30]
 Probably the TNT up the butt line is pretty funny.  You always heard the stories of that when you were a kid.  Yeah.  Like there was always some kid in the neighborhood, yeah, and he took a firecracker and he put  it up the cat's butt and lit it.  And you know it never happened.  It's just one of those stories, you know.  All right.  Man, we got a great story on the line.  We'll get to next.  But in the meantime, we've got to get back to the rock and roll.  Green Day, our pals.  Yeah.  When are they coming in to say hi to us?  When they're in town, I guess.  The last time we had Green Day on our radio show at another radio station, they came in 
[38:00]
 and we allowed them to go through the entire music library of this radio station.  Yeah.  And smash all the CDs that they felt we shouldn't have been playing at the time.  Yeah, they didn't like.  So they threw them.  They broke the clock.  Mm-hmm.  They're just nuts.  Now I'm thinking here at NAW, I'm looking at a wall of CDs.  There's some purging that needs to be done.  So there's an open invitation to the gang of Green Day to come in here and we will allow  you to go through our entire CD collection and smash what you don't like. 
[38:30]
 Yeah, there are certain parts of the rock and roll library that should be taken off  the Dewey Decimal system.  Yes.  You know.  So we're going to invite our pals, our buddies, Green Day to come in here and purge the library  for us.  Yeah.  They did a great job at the last station we were at, and I do believe they would have  a field day in here.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York.  That's the new band Train with the song called Free As You Make Your Ride Home on this FU 
[39:00]
 Friday.  Run around the studio like a madman today.  So many FUs coming in.  Yeah.  There's a couple good ones on the instant feedback really fast here.  This is from Kelly.  Kelly, I want to send out a big FU to my boss, the lesbian, who hits on me constantly.  You look like a man, bitch, but not enough like one.  Whoa, man.  That's got to stink.  That's cold.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom, did you read his?  No.  From New York about the killer kitten song. 
[39:30]
 I think a little sarcasm is in this.  I'm not sure.  Guys, I was wondering if you could start warning people before you played some of those bad  songs.  Some of us just aren't that bright.  I had the blood of about 30 kittens on my hands before someone told me it was a joke.  Sorry, I have to go now.  That same person just pointed out I have my shoes on backwards.  He was killing kittens before someone even had to tell him it was a joke.  My God.  We are so wrong.  We love sarcasm. 
[40:00]
 Let's stress that.  We love sarcasm.  Keep it coming.  This is a good sarcastic one.  My colleague and I would like to send out a tag team FU to our secretary.  Today, she wore a dress to work that just didn't quite cut it.  She is too old and too fat, especially for this dress.  Anyway, we were walking towards her desk earlier when she turned around and bent over to open  the bottom filing drawer.  Ugh.  We couldn't help it, but the guy autopilot thing took over and we looked.  It was nasty. 
[40:30]
 The guy autopilot.  Yeah, you have to look.  And FU to her for ruining our lunch.  Guys will always sneak a peek.  It doesn't matter what it looks like.  It always will.  I remember a teacher of mine and she was, when you're in I guess sixth or seventh grade,  she was an old lady to me.  You know?  She was probably twenty.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Old lady.  But she bent over to show me something and her blouse kind of flopped open at the top  and I actually saw a nip. 
[41:00]
 Get out.  And I was sitting there and I'm just starting to breathe heavy and everything.  Very embarrassing.  But guys will do it.  We will sneak the peek.  And how old were you?  Sixth grade.  Sixth grade?  That's like striking gold when you're in sixth grade.  Yeah, yeah.  It was pretty embarrassing though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was kind of erotic, embarrassing.  Cute little story.  Interesting.  More school days.  Yeah.  Rich is telling us we've got a great FU on the line here.  Hi, Andy W.  Hi.  Hi.  FU, huh?  Let me tell you what happened to me.  Christmas Eve day, I've been living with my boyfriend for five years. 
[41:30]
 All right.  And Christmas Eve day, I came home from work too fine that he was in my house, in my bed,  with someone else.  Oh.  Wow, who was it?  Well, I found out later on who it was, but the best is my father had just passed away  three weeks prior to this.  Oh my Lord.  Insult to Andrew.  And let me tell you another thing.  She's married.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Now, would you come home early?  Well, no.  I came home on time, but they weren't there.  But I knew that someone was in the bed and I happened to see presents that she had given  him.  And then I happened to see a picture of him.  And I was like, oh my God, I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy. 
[42:00]
 I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  John is his name.  He doesn't put stuffed animals on my bed. 
[42:30]
 Only girls do that.  He plays them just so right.  Did you look for errant hairs?  Yes.  Did you find any?  Of course.  Oh man.  Pretty gross.  And you know what else?  They left their pubies in the bed.  This piece of s***.  Wow.  He was a pole bear at my father's funeral.  Holy cow.  This is just awful.  And the day that my father was buried, he left me and went to the cemetery.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  And when it's her, he told me I had to go to work.  Holy s***.  Can I be arrested for doing this? 
[43:00]
 No.  No, not at all.  Are you sure?  Come on, man.  What?  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  I'm jamming with that.  Come on, man.  What?  I'm jamming with them.  Eddie's getting experimental in that song and you had to ruin it at the end there. 
[43:30]
 The Rock of New York 1027W&EW Pearl Jam Live from Live on Two Legs.  That's daughter reciting some Neil Young lyrics in the middle of that song.  He's so profound, man.  He's just so hip.  Keep on rocking in the free world.  You might have heard that in that song.  That's cool.  I like it.  It's better, man.  There is no cooler.  It's Opien Anthony.  Hey, the FU's are just great today.  Keep them coming.  Jersey Girl writes, I want to send a big FU to my ex as of today. 
[44:00]
 Boyfriend, who I just discovered today, is back with his ex-girlfriend even though we  were still seeing each other.  I don't think she knows about me, but he's been seeing me ever since he moved out of  their house in October.  And we slept together as recently as Sunday night.  So if he said he was going out for cigarettes and was gone for four hours, now you know  why.  FU Mike, and I hope you get those hemorrhoids back.  Not a happy camper.  Well, it's up to the hemorrhoids part of that, man.  What is going on there? 
[44:30]
 All right.  Hey, we've got a good FU on line one.  Okay, we'll go to that next.  We want to expand FU Friday, we've decided.  Expand it?  Yeah.  We want to add a new concept to Fridays.  Oh, I see.  Right, right.  That's what we were discussing.  Yes.  To maybe make people feel even better than just venting is.  Correct.  Yeah, okay.  And that is, Anthony?  I'll let you explain it.  It's a little thing called the Friday fake-o. 
[45:00]
 Yeah, baby.  It's a wonderful feature.  We get a lovely lady to call us up if she wants to do the fake-o.  And she works it up, goes through a fake orgasm.  Yes.  On the air.  Yes.  Building.  Yes.  How do you like saying it, Opie?  I like when the orgasm builds to a crescendo.  Yes, there you go.  I like that. 
[45:30]
 The slow build, the big finish.  Yes.  And then the relaxing...  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know there's a lot of people stuck in traffic right now?  Mm-hmm.  And I think that would make a lot of people happy.  Yes, it would.  As they're stuck in traffic.  Mm-hmm.  And other people will be truly disgusted.  Or we'll worry about you guys later.  I might take care of the people that'll enjoy this.  Of course.  Just trying to make people happy on their miserable drive home.  So if you're a fine young lady and you want to give the Friday fake-o a try today, 
[46:00]
 we're just starting it today.  This is something that we're going to try to work in once a week on Fridays.  Give us a call, 212-757-1027.  All right?  Very good.  And we got a great FU on one, I think.  Hi, who's this?  Hello, this is Inga.  Ooh, Inga.  Hi.  How are you?  Inga, are you a German girl?  No, actually I'm a black girl.  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I love black girls.  Yeah.  What do you look like? 
[46:30]
 I'm 5'9", 130 pounds.  Wow.  I got wild curly hair like a lion's mane.  Wow.  I want to participate in FU Friday.  All right.  You know that my fantasy is to be with one black girl.  One damn lousy black girl.  They chew you up, you whitey.  I got a wows tattoo on my back, too. 
[47:00]
 I'm hot.  You have a tat?  I got a huge Japanese koi all over my back.  Can you see it?  Are you a dark, dark black girl?  No, I'm like, um, kata konekse, like, you know, coffee with milk.  Yay.  Because some black guys I see get a lot of tats these days.  Oh, no, I look great.  It's like, what the hell is that?  No, I look great, baby.  Oh, wow.  It's a Japanese koi.  I like to move it around.  You know, wow.  Anyway, check it out.  Wait, wait, wait.  My fantasy, you know, is to be with a black girl, like I just said. 
[47:30]
 And it goes this far where I used to go into black clubs and try to, like, pick up a black  girl.  Yeah, that's going to work for Olby.  You want to see all those curves, huh?  Oh, and I'd go in and I would just try to work in and, like, you know, try to get the  wrap down.  And so many girls would laugh at me.  Of course.  You're like the crack-ass, crack-ass cracker.  Wow.  But I tried.  I tried a bunch of times.  Like, man, I just want to go black one time, man. 
[48:00]
 Hey, hey, homegirl.  What up?  What about me and you get down with it?  You would have loved me.  All right.  Let's hear you out, too.  Anyway, my FU is out to this guy who's an Italian guy, 41.  And, you know, we were kicking it for a while.  I would give him great phone sex.  Kicking it means having sex.  Wait, you were having phone sex with him? 
[48:30]
 Yeah.  I would have phone sex.  I would have real sex.  Wait, let's hear your phone sex voice.  Okay.  Don't say anything that will get us kicked off the radio.  Be a little careful.  Like, hi.  Oh, man, this guy.  Oh, god, I miss that night.  Oh, the static.  Huh?  Damn static on your phone.  Static wrecked it.  Oh, wrecked it.  Okay.  What?  All right, try again.  Okay.  Man, this guy.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Man, this guy's time to close the big. 
[49:00]
 Don't take the glass away.  Like, just up.  There we go.  All right, good.  Is that gonna get you kicked off?  It's getting close.  If anyone could hear it.  Oh, anyway.  So you're not gonna participate or what?  No, go.  Go with the answer.  Okay, cool.  So anyway, I was kicking it with this guy.  Oh, my god.  And we were having a great time.  And you know, he's older, 13 years, my senior.  So I thought that was being really cool.  You know, I'm gonna go with this guy.  Okay.  So anyway, I was kicking it with this guy.  Oh, my god.  And we were having a great time.  Oh, no.  You just wrecked everything.  Check, please.  Check, please.  Oh, you know.  I think this table needs to be bussed.  Look at the time.  We gotta go. 
[49:30]
 Oh, no.  You know.  What the heck, man?  I'm doing a lot better.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  Oh, my god.  I'm hung like a damn acorn now.  Hey.  What the heck?  We understand it's tragic and all, obviously. 
[50:00]
 Yeah, but guess what?  But it kind of...  I look, come on.  I look like ten times better than I did before.  All right.  It's, you know, I'm glad you're fighting it and stuff.  But we weren't expecting that.  Wow, I can't let that feel.  Come on.  This is my FU Friday.  All right, go ahead.  Anyway, so like, I had a horrible New Year's.  You took somebody else out.  Had a horrible Christmas.  You took somebody else out.  And it was just like, this guy totally ditched me, you know, this week and every week.  But I got him back, so.  Yeah, how'd you get him back? 
[50:30]
 Well, I like called his cell phone, his work phone, his home phone, and I antagonized him  to death.  And then he got like, he had surgery this week, so I think I got him back.  Uh-oh.  What did he get?  He had a brain tumor, so he got radiation.  Wow.  What the heck?  Where is he?  Wow.  What the heck?  Where are you guys having sex?  On a toxic waste dump?  Jesus.  No, come on.  It's good.  It's a good FU Friday, man.  Yeah, that's a cute little story.  Now I'm dating a head. 
[51:00]
 Hey, we're both like really hot people.  You would never expect it.  All right, well, then, I don't know.  Well, good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  You just killed the mood.  No, come on.  I used to be a model.  I can do good.  All right.  Well, you'll have to come in and see us someday.  So, I'll show you my new, uh...  Yeah, we'll see.  Rebuilt.  Yeah, we'll take out anything.  All right.  Well, thank you for calling in.  Okay, babe.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Oh, you know, and you know who was screening the phone calls? 
[51:30]
 Gary, our boss.  Gary, our boss.  Thanks, Gary.  That was a great one.  Wow.  Geez.  Get her on the phone.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  The Black Crow is kicking my heart around from the top.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry. 
[52:00]
 I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.

Anyway, Stacey writes, because we want a girl to do the Friday Fake Orgasm today.  Now, when we first got to N.E.W., we were doing this feature.  Yeah.  But management and a lot of the listeners, the older listeners, because we didn't purge  the system yet.  No, we tried this a little too soon. 
[53:00]
 They really weren't into the Friday Fake Orgasm.  Everyone was not into it.  It almost killed me.  I was listening to N.E.W. for 23 years and, oh my, I heard a girl moaning and I started  getting a feeling in my prostate.  So we had to cancel the feature before it really got going.  Yeah.  But we figured at this point, if we could start a Hummer Club, if we could get the FU 
[53:30]
 Friday going, I think it's time to bring back the Friday Fake Orgasm.  Yes.  And according to Stacey's facts with her boobs here, she's into it too.  She writes, Opinac, hey guys, I'm alone and bored at work and I heard you needed someone  to do the Friday Fake Orgasm today.  You guys used to do the Friday Fake Orgasm when you first got to N.E.W. and then you  stopped.  I must admit, I missed hearing it.  Hearing strange girls moan on the radio was a real turn on to me.  Then she goes on, because, all right, then the boobs are in the middle of the facts. 
[54:00]
 And then at the bottom it says, if you like my 36 C's, give me a call at work and I'll  give it a try.  Love you guys.  Stacey.  This could be her right here.  All right.  Rick called up the number here.  Let's get her on the phone.  Hello?  Hi, is Stacey there?  This is she.  Stacey?  Yes.  Do you have a nice tattoo right below your breast? 
[54:30]
 Yes, I do.  Stacey!  Hey.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Good, how are you?  You faxed us your breast today.  I did.  And what a lovely set.  36 C's.  That's right.  Beautiful.  And a nice little tattoo.  What is that, of like a sun or something?  Yeah, it is.  I have to get it colored, though.  It's a sun right below her boobs, bro.  Those are pretty big.  You like those?  Did you press them against the Xerox machine?  I sure did.  Wow.  Now, Stacey, we need someone to do today's Friday Fake O. 
[55:00]
 Yeah?  I'm not brave enough in your little fax to say that you missed a Friday Fake O, so we  thought that you should do it today.  Right here in the office?  Yeah!  Okay.  I mean, all it has to be is like, what, 30, 40 seconds tops?  Oh, tops.  And, you know, you have that nice build and it builds to a crescendo.  Crescendo is open-minded.  And don't leave us hanging.  Every once in a while, a girl does this and they leave us hanging.  You got to have the big finish.  By the way, Stacey, what do you look like?  We got to visualize.  Okay, I have blonde hair. 
[55:30]
 Ooh.  I have like, bluish-greenish eyes.  Okay.  You're obviously a very good-looking lady.  Thank you.  All right.  So you ready for the Friday Fake O?  I guess so.  All right, it's Stacey, everyone. 
[56:00]
 Oh. 
[56:30]
 Oh.  Yeah!  That's it for Stacey!  Wow!  Wow, that was awesome!  That's one of the best ones we've had.  That is.  That is the best one, I think.  And by the way, just to let you know, the noise that you heard in the background, this?  Yeah.  That was me feeling up your facts of your breasts.  The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW. 
[57:00]
 It's Opie and Anthony.  We are having lots and lots of fun today.  Oh, yeah.  It's FU Friday and we've pretty much lost control of our own radio show today, but that's  okay.  Seems like people are enjoying it today and thanks for the kind words and facts as an  email.  Definitely appreciate it.  If we've lost control, at least it's in good hands.  You crazy bastard.  Yeah, exactly.  Hi, NEW.  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's Barry and Jersey.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Got an awesome nip story for you.  That's what I mean by losing control of the show. 
[57:30]
 I'm sitting in my station with my six-year-old, my three-year-old.  I'm 35 years old and I still remember it like it was yesterday.  What happened?  I was hanging with my friend.  I grew up in Yonkers, taking the subway down the city and we're in sixth grade, coming  down the stairs of the subway and my friend sees this girl.  They're a really hot girl.  She's standing underneath the stairs and we look down and you can see the nip completely  and utterly.  We stood there for literally six to ten minutes staring at this girl from the end until a 
[58:00]
 detrain came.  She knew it the whole time.  The whole time she kept looking up at us and laughing and everything else and it was unbelievable.  It was phenomenal.  By the way, I just want to say the reason why I listen to you guys is you're amazing  and you're the only guys on the face of the earth that would probably play Untiled by  Zeppelin anyway.  Yeah, that song rocks.  Let me ask you one question.  You're always busting on people for song lists, playlists and stuff like that.  That's your own choice?  Yeah.  Awesome. 
[58:30]
 Yeah, that one is.  I just sat home.  I've listened to you on 287.  I'm sitting in my basement now listening to you guys.  I want to tell you that nip story.  I was trying to get in touch with you the whole way home on 287.  That's great.  I know the ladies out there...  It's a really good nip story but I'll let you guys go.  I know you probably got a lot to do.  I'll be calling in again.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  You guys rule.  Yeah, that nip story.  The ladies shaking their heads right now in their cars.  But guys just love stuff like that.  The sneak a peek is a lot more erotic I think than sometimes just seeing... 
[59:00]
 Like going to a club and seeing a dancer, a topless dancer.  If you could sneak a peek off somebody that you normally wouldn't...  Well, we were talking on the way home last night because we had Laura Cornyn earlier  in the week.  She did a great job for us by the way.  Everyone's ranting or even about her appearance.  She was talking about the number one fetishes for men and women.  Yeah, she got the man fetish all wrong.  What was the woman fetish again?  The woman fetish was smell.  Oh yeah, smells and stuff. 
[59:30]
 The way a guy smells.  And the number one fetish for guys she said is...  Feet.  No.  Girls in open-toed shoes.  High-heeled, open-toed.  That doesn't work for me.  And Anthony and I think the number one fetish for guys is voyeurism.  It's got to be voyeurism to some point.  I'm not talking about trotting through your neighbor's yard and looking through the window.  Yeah, no, that's not what we're getting at.  There's just many forms of it.  But something like that story where all of a sudden you're copying a peak, that just drives a man nuts.  How cool was it when you'd be in the pool and a girl would dive in and come up and her top was kind of down. 
[60:00]
 And she quickly pulled it back and you'd just go like, oh, I got a peak.  You would love that.  Exactly.  We're really getting perverted these days.  I know.  Because we just don't care anymore.  I don't even understand.  We don't care.  We found out this week that there's just a guy, I don't know, listening to our show every day trying to decide what to do with us. 
[60:30]
 It has hit the Internet that he's taking a look at Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  So taking a look into Opie and Anthony.  Into.  So somewhere...  Colinscope?  Somewhere there's a guy probably with a big pad and a pen in a suit probably listening to our entire show.  And he's going to decide our fate according to the Internet.  He's taking a look at Opie and Anthony.  Read it on the Internet.  It's got to be true.  It's got to be true.  Everything is true on the Internet.  So with that, I guess we have entered the I don't care stage. 
[61:00]
 I love freedom.  Hi, NAW.  Hi, this is Rachel.  I want to send an FU to my big fat Guinea X boyfriend.  What did he do?  You want to know what he did?  Yeah.  Sunday, we got into a fight, right?  We were at a party.  We got into a fight.  He's driving me home.  It's like 1230 in the morning.  You know what he does?  From a moving car, he opens the door, pushes me out of the car onto the highway. 
[61:30]
 I swear to God.  And there's like a killer around here, right?  That's like killing girls near the highway and stuff.  And he just drives off.  He just drives off, leaves me there, scuffs up my shoes.  It took me five years to pick out shoes that I liked.  And he just scuffs up my shoes, ruined my shoes.  That's well two miles.  Can you believe this?  Don't laugh.  Don't laugh.  He's fat.  He's disgusting.  And so I broke up with him.  And I don't care because I'm going out with somebody else.  I'm messing around with someone else.  I don't care.  He needs to lose some weight. 
[62:00]
 He was repulsing.  And I just want to send an FU to him.  Hey, how fast was he going when he pushed you out?  How fast was he going?  He was going like 40 miles an hour.  He slowed down a little for me.  What, did you tuck and roll?  I went like face first out of the car.  It's not funny.  It's not funny.  Horrible.  What?  I would have been going 70.  Yeah, that's crazy.  That was a bad voice.  You think you're funny, huh?  It wasn't funny.  And so he came over the next day.  And he wanted to make up with me, right? 
[62:30]
 I'm like, no way.  And so he tells me that.  He pushed me out because he wanted to teach me a lesson.  Can you believe the balls on his thigh?  So I told him.  I'm like, FU.  I'm messing with someone else.  And he's a lot hotter than he is.  All right.  Well, take care of yourself.  All right.  You're not going to put me on the air?  We're going to put you on the air, definitely.  OK.  All right.  All right.  I'll hold on.  Yeah, you hold.  You hold.  You're on the air.  These people, they don't understand the delay, Opie.  That's OK.  Gary in Farmingdale, got to say hi to him. 
[63:00]
 Yeah.  He said that was definitely the best fake-o he's ever heard.  That was amazing.  Keep it up.  He got a headache yesterday laughing so hard at Lewis Black.  Lewis Black, huh?  Cool.  And he just wants to bring up that the Sony PlayStation commercial for Battle Tanks with  Snuggles the Teddy Bear running on fire with the missing arm cracks him up every time.  Later, guys.  I haven't seen that one yet.  You haven't seen the one for Battle Tanks?  No, I have not.  It starts off like a Snuggles commercial, you know, that Snuggles the Bear?  Oh, it's so cozy and cushy. 
[63:30]
 And he's like on top of the washing machine on some soft towel and it snuggles, you know?  And he looks out the window and there's this big battle tank coming at him and it starts  firing at him.  He's running through a field.  At one point, his arm is missing and the other one's on fire.  He's waving it trying to put it out and the tank is just shooting at him.  It's hysterical.  It kills me, too.  I understand what you mean, Gary.  Those commercials are the best.  Yeah, really funny.  They come up with some really good ones.  Hey, are we going to see a Doritos Chick commercial Sunday?  Oh, the big Super Bowl commercials. 
[64:00]
 All the DJs got to be talking about that, old buddy.  Oh, she is doing a spot this year.  That was the best commercial last year at Super Bowl.  She's hot.  The lady in the laundromat with the Doritos.  She used to be what?  Miss USA or something like that?  Yeah.  Ali Landry.  She is doing a spot.  Oh, I can't wait to see that this Sunday.  Nice looking lady.  And real fast, as we talk about the Super Bowl, we got to congratulate once again Tom  Pixiano, I believe is his name from Bayshore.  We are going to his house, Anthony and Opie. 
[64:30]
 Yes.  With a 53 inch Sony projection screen TV.  And we are going to hang out with Tom and his pals and watch the Super Bowl.  And what did Ben load in the back of your truck?  Lots and lots of Soty Pop.  More than just Soty Pop.  It better be.  This is going to be a party.  This is going to be a heck of a party.  Tons of food, tons of brew, lots of soda.  We need lots of soda.  I need soda because Poopsy doesn't let me drink.  There better be beer in there.  There is beer. 
[65:00]
 Plenty of beer.  Plenty of beer.  I made sure of that.  And we talked to Tom earlier and he noted his reaction was when we said that we are  coming to his house with the big TV.  What?  He goes, my wife is going to kill me.  Oh yeah, yeah.  I did hear that.  So Ben, you put that in the back of Opie's truck?  Opie's truck is filled.  It's so crazy.  You went into the back door?  Yes.  I went in the back door.  Only door Ben the Fag knows how to use.  He loaded up the back door. 
[65:30]
 You guys love this.  My fan club.  And that will be Earl and I at the Nets game in about an hour or whatever.  Alright.  We want to harass Earl and I.  We will be in the N.E.W. van with tons of stuff to give away.  The metal ants.  Soon as Earl gets finished, we'll have spots.  Step up, say hi to Ben the Fag and Black Earl.  Black Earl.  Making them famous on our radio show.  At least somebody gets famous over this show.  Maybe not.  Did you see Prince Charles on the news last night? 
[66:00]
 Getting out with Camilla the Pig?  Parker whatever.  It was unbelievable.  They leave this restaurant.  They had informed the press that they were going to be at this restaurant so you could take pictures.  Finally they were going to get pictures.  If you saw this on the news, it looked like a strobe light was going off.  Correct.  It was like a flash catching pictures.  It had to be 10,000 pictures being taken.  What happens to us when we leave the N.E.W. studios, Anthony?  An occasional homeless guy throws a penny at our heads. 
[66:30]
 You can hear the crickets.  Thank you.  Please the crowd stay away please.  One at a time.  You got a quarter man.  I need a quarter.  WNEW the Rock of New York from my own prison.  The debut CD from Creed.  Little Jimi Hendrix ending there. 
[67:00]
 Rock.  That's a song called One by Creed.  It's open Anthony.  FU Friday going quite well today.  You guys are finally getting the concept of FU Friday.  A lot of people are pretty pissed off today.  This is how it's going to work from now on.  Monday through Thursday.  We love the audience participation.  Every day of the week.  Monday through Thursday we'll do our regular show. 
[67:30]
 When you can jump in, you jump in.  But Friday's pretty much we're just going to hand over the radio station to you guys.  We've talked about a lot of pretty wacky stuff today because that's what you guys came up with.  You never know what you're going to hear when you go to the phones.  So we're having a lot of fun with that.  Thank you guys.  We're actually starting to be nice to our listeners.  Now we know we have some.  We always used to get in trouble for just unloading on people on the phone. 
[68:00]
 You can't be that mean to the people that call you.  They're calling us assholes.  Just please don't call them the C word.  Remember that one?  I was dragged into the office one day.  Did one of you two call a woman that called up the C word?  But you know, didn't say the C word.  And then Anthony and I are looking at each other.  We're pretty good at fessing up.  The bosses confront us with something.  We'll admit it. 
[68:30]
 We have no problem admitting it.  But this time it was too early in the game.  We're like, well.  And then the boss looks right at me and he goes, I have a feeling it was Opie.  Opie seems to be the mean one that has a lot of stress and anger in his body.  And then I got pissed.  I go, all right, no, that was Anthony that time.  I said, well, you didn't even have to say that because at that point I said, well, no, it may have been me.  So I was a little bit angry that day.  I'm like, wait a minute.  Come on.  Yeah, I tend to be the one that goes nuts. 
[69:00]
 But yeah, but that time it was Anthony.  Oops.  Our bosses just didn't get it in the beginning.  No.  Because we'd have people just every day screaming at us.  It wasn't a lot of fun around here six months ago.  Screaming at us.  Get the F off the radio.  And what are we supposed to do?  Sit there and go, thanks for calling, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Your opinion is wonderful and we will take it.  No.  So we're like, shut up.  You've got to fight back. 
[69:30]
 Yeah.  But it's nice now being able to take calls and actually have people participate on the show.  It's fun.  Well, we just feel like we're starting to build a nice little audience.  Yeah.  And it gives us confidence to go on.  Thank you, people.  Don't get weepy on us.  Actually, we don't give a damn.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, is this O.P. or Anthony?  Both.  Yeah, what's up?  How are you doing?  Good.  I want to tell you, I heard Howard this morning and they were talking about you guys.  Really?  They mentioned our show.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[70:00]
 Well, the story goes, yeah, when I was young I was really...  Well, I heard it yesterday.  This morning I heard it on Howard.  Yeah.  It's a good thing.  Big Black, if that suck-in mother-fucker is listening to our show, give us credit, you  asshole.  I know.  I know.  You're a fucking dick.  You're a fucking dick.  You're a fucking dick.  You're a fucking dick.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  You asshole.  You piece of shit.  You fuck. 
[70:30]
 You fuck.  Oh my God.  Holy shit.  Are you guys playing Bra Bingo today?  We need the help around here and if Big Black is going to call Howard with a cute little  story that's going to make everyone laugh, at least, you know, tell everyone where it  came from.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  All right, man.  Humorous anecdote.  You guys are doing a great job.  Thank you.  Hey, Homer.  We don't need any help, right?  No, no, no, no, not at all. 
[71:00]
 No.  Please, please, Don Stern.  A mention would be nice.  You hold all of your listeners in your pocket like so many nickels and dimes.  You must let us all drink from the well.  Don Stern, if somebody uses a story that was on our show, please say our names, Don Stern.  All right.  I don't know what he's talking about, Robin. 
[71:30]
 Big Black calls up and he tells a story about something like a black guy or something.  I don't know where I heard it, Robin.  What do you think, Jackie?  Too much fun.  Hey, everyone is requesting Stephen Lynch songs. 
[72:00]
 Yeah, people love Stephen, man.  Yeah, because he's so honest.  Yeah.  He's honest like us.  He's another guy that just doesn't care, man.  Say now, pay later.  Exactly.  That's our philosophy.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Little feet.  A lot of your music.  You know, I realized that too.  Yeah.  One day after having sung that song, the priest song, the gerbil song, all in a row.  Yes, you've got issues.  Yeah.  A few there.  Okay.  Deal with those, I guess.  You're secure in your manhood.  I guess that's fine.  And I am.  Yeah, sure you are, Stephen.  Can't wait to get him in for a batch of songs.  Yeah.  I'm excited.  I'm excited. 
[72:30]
 I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  I'm excited.  Are you excited?  Yeah.  I'm excited.  Oh I like it here.  I like it here.  Don't move.  I'm going to put this log right back on.  That's okay.  Is that okay?  My gravity.  Okay.  Then you're going to put the log on, and put the psych accredited.  No, it doesn't count.  I mean you have physical arrow. 
[73:00]
 I'm not going to type your name.  No.  symbol.  You can type your tone, so I can return to this where I was when I began.  Okay.  Okay.  So, sonically, it's frequency on an R10??  Nyah.  F hub?  Okay.  Oh sure? To come, yeah. Okay.  I thought we were one of those stations when it got dark and it went off the air. That's  all.  That? No. No. We'll be back Monday to tell you all about our little party that we're 
[73:30]
 going to. That's Sunday. At Tom's House in Bayshore. We're looking forward to that. We  really are. </pre>
