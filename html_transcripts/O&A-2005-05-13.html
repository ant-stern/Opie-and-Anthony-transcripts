<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show begins with Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton in studio. Norton's severely bloodshot eye becomes the initial focus, the result of a self-inflicted injury from accidentally shooting himself in the eye with semen during masturbation, an incident he claims has happened multiple times.  This leads to numerous listener calls reacting to the story.  Planned guests for the show include Stephen Lynch, Pepper from a band (unspecified), and Joe Perry from Aerosmith.  The hosts discuss a major landslide in New York City that Opie witnessed, alongside recent news stories involving police shootings and individuals stealing and driving military vehicles (tanks and a bulldozer).  A segment focuses on a personal ad placed by Susan Smith, the convicted murderer of her children, prompting reactions from the hosts and callers, and a discussion about writing letters to Smith. A significant portion of the show criticizes XM Satellite Radio's marketing, focusing on their perceived unfair exclusion from commercials despite their popularity, contrasting it with the constant promotion of Bob Edwards from NPR. They discuss the poor contrast in their own XM commercials – attempting a family-friendly image despite their show's controversial nature; callers offer their opinions.

The show continues with listener calls and a graphic incident involving studio guest Robert Kelly becoming violently ill after viewing a graphic video of a woman's hemorrhoids. The hosts also mention upcoming segments featuring audio from "the grandma sex lady" and "the psycho ex-girlfriend".  The hosts extensively critique the news media's coverage of the New York City retaining wall collapse onto the Henry Hudson Parkway, highlighting the sensationalism, 9/11 comparisons, lack of initial details about casualties, and vague location descriptions.  They satirize reporters' questions and include sound effects and news report snippets.  Callers share their experiences and frustrations; one claims to be from Fox News and makes a joke about Jimmy Norton.  The conversation branches out to Halloween candy safety statistics, a caller's experience during the collapse, and a CBS "Shame on You" segment about a jeweler allegedly refusing service to Black customers.  Further critiques of news media practices conclude this segment.

The discussion then turns to a news story about a jewelry store owner who refuses service to Black men. The hosts and callers debate whether this is racist, considering the owner’s past robbery experience.  They discuss the complexities of fear versus outright racism, using examples of racial profiling by police and in car insurance. A caller, a 20-year veteran highway patrolman, shares his experiences with similar accusations.  The media's portrayal of such events is also discussed.

A comedic bit follows with Stephen Lynch, who is visibly intoxicated and delivers rambling, often nonsensical, comments and performs two new songs: one about a Nazi girlfriend, and another about Satan.  Clips and discussion of a grandma giving sex advice on television, with crude commentary from the hosts and Lynch, are also included.  The hosts criticize a competitor's new satellite radio device, highlighting its flaws.

A segment focusing on sexually explicit topics begins with a discussion on male ejaculation and masturbation, followed by a graphic review of a sex toy deemed a failure.  The possibility of pregnancy from semen transferred via fingers is discussed, along with a caller's humorous anecdote about a double standard in media regarding sex advice.  Voicemails from a caller's psycho ex-girlfriend, filled with profanity-laced tirades and demands for her cat's return, are played, interspersed with the hosts' commentary.  Joe Perry of Aerosmith arrives late.  The interview covers his tour, experiences in the music industry, Aerosmith's longevity, the making of "Walk This Way," his new solo album, listener questions about setlists, internal band dynamics, and the balance between creative expression and commercial success. He discusses the band's future and touring prospects.  Mention is made of a missing bandmate, Pepper, found with a naked woman in his hotel room.

Further conversation with Joe Perry covers his guitar setup, friendship with Jimmy Page (described both positively and negatively), encounters with celebrities (including the governor of Hawaii and Robert De Niro), a caller’s recounting of attending numerous Aerosmith concerts, Aerosmith's touring, a new live album, and the contributions of keyboardist Russ Irwin. Perry also discusses his barbecue sauce line, a deer hunting trip with Ted Nugent, and the inspiration for his song "Shaking My Cage," which is played.  The segment is filled with casual banter and jokes, including an anecdote about Perry nearly vomiting from smoking a large Cuban cigar while talking to the governor.  The show concludes with continued discussion about XM marketing and the landslide.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Tim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I want a body rock.  I'm scared of you. 
[00:04:30]  I'm scared of you, sir.  And I'm protecting myself.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please follow the police.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  You blew it.  Hello, exactly.  You're not being fair.  This isn't fair.  I kiss you on the mouth.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me? 
[00:05:00]  Of course there's something wrong with him.  He's a Negro.  What?  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  Trading places.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh.  That's better.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:05:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Homer!  Homer!  Homer!  Always funny.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  It's Opie, it's Anthony,  and it's little Jimmy Norton.  We've got so much to do today.  Yes, we do.  Yeah, we'll talk about Jimmy in one second here,  but I just want to remind folks that we've got Stephen Lynch coming in today.  Yeah.  One of our favorites.  He hasn't been around in a while, and he's coming in. 
[00:06:00]  In about an hour, he'll be playing a lot of his songs that we know and love.  Unless he's coming from the north of the GWB.  Yeah, we're going to.  Landslide.  I know, we'll get into the landslide story in a second here.  Also, Pepper from COC in studio today.  And this just in.  Joe Perry from Aerosmith will be stopping by and saying hi.  Now, I wanted to go right with the landslide story, Anthony.  It's on the front pages of all the newspapers pretty much all over the country today. 
[00:06:30]  It's a huge story.  And we were just going to start riffing right off the bat,  but then little Jimmy Norton walks into the studio,  and we can't just, like, blow this off.  We can't just make believe that you don't have this awful red eye happening.  With your bloodshot eye, it looks like you have pink eye.  My left eye is bad, right?  Yeah.  It's really bad.  It's completely red.  Yeah.  It looks like it's bothering you.  Yeah, it's a little dry and itchy.  Yeah, a little itchy.  Yeah.  Feels like there's sand in it.  No, it's just, it feels like dry, like you just woke up and you need to put drops in. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  It is stupid of me.  I thought maybe allergies.  No.  Conjunctivitis.  Yeah, maybe some kind of pink eye.  Pink eye.  Oh, no, no, no.  No.  No.  Then Jimmy just casually tells us why he has a red eye, and I think for the first time  are in a bit of shock.  No, I wasn't surprised at all, to tell you the truth.  I wasn't shocked or surprised.  I just went, oh, I thought perhaps he could have been joking for a second.  Really?  And I'm like, oh, that makes perfect sense. 
[00:07:30]  Maybe the word shock isn't the right word.  It's, I don't know.  I don't know what to say, actually.  It's ridiculous.  It made me feel a little uncomfortable.  All right.  A little uncomfortable.  I am trying to, I'm trying to come up with the right word, Anthony.  Maybe shock, you're right, is a little, a little, a little too harsh.  It didn't shock me.  It was kind of, I think we both were sitting here going, hmm, there's something I can't 
[00:08:00]  relate to.  Yeah.  There you go.  Really?  That's pretty much, no, no, no, Jimmy.  Oh, dude.  Absolutely never.  This is maybe my eighth time.  Wow.  Maybe.  Absolutely.  Eighth time?  In life.  It says I'm, you know, teenager short.  Well, why don't you let everyone know what happened to your eyeball?  It's not, it's not even a big mystery.  Hold on, maybe, maybe if you're drinking coffee or eating right now, you might want to,  you might want to hold off on that.  I think some people might get a little sick.  No, it's not that bad.  I, um, last time I got a phone call. 
[00:08:30]  I'm online.  I got a phone call from a young gal who I'd been chatting with a while about doing massage.  It was late.  I was going to bed.  I'm like, hey, you know what?  I'm stressed lately.  Massage will be good.  Uh-huh.  So she comes over and gives me a relatively decent massage.  Um, and she's like, what do you normally do during your sessions?  She was kind of hinting it more.  So, um, I flip over my back and she's kind of whacking my bag.  She won't do much else.  She kind of falls asleep with her face on my thigh.  It was awful.  She was like, are you kidding?  I'm asleep.  I'm like, date raping my massage therapist.  Jesus.  And, uh, she didn't do anything else. 
[00:09:00]  She just kind of whacked.  And I'm jerking it.  And then, um, I, I shot.  And, uh, bullseye.  I shot, it really was, it was Selma 1961 footage.  It was a direct hit into my own eye.  And it wasn't even heard.  I was the one in control of the hose.  And I blasted myself right in the face.  And I've done that before.  Didn't you know it was coming?  It's coming right for you!  You just, in that moment, you know how it is.  You don't, you don't realize it's going to be right in the eye. 
[00:09:30]  Sometimes I'll actually, because I know, like, if I know,  sometimes it just kind of burbles out.  But other times I know this is going to be a problem.  Yeah.  I'll actually aim up because I know it's going to go over my head.  And it's not always.  It's once in a while I'll get one like that.  But I've hit the wall behind me on my bed.  And I've got pictures of, you know.  Pictures.  Very proud.  Yeah.  Frame 237.  Right behind my head.  You've hit the wall behind you.  Yeah.  Well, it's right behind my head in my bedroom.  That's a talent, my friend.  Yeah.  I've had a couple of women comment on it.  But it's not always I can do it.  Once in a while.  Now that I say that, the next girl's with me is probably, 
[00:10:00]  oh, let's see that.  And it will just, you know.  It's a ribble out.  Yeah.  Down syndrome child enjoying an ice cream cone.  Get out of the way!  Just a glop in my heels.  Oh, you've got some nice pressure buildup.  Yeah, I think that's what it is.  I just have good, like, tightening and good Kegel work.  Yeah.  Good muscles.  Which is surprising because you're whacking off just about every night.  It's disgusting.  So you would think that maybe the pressure would be a little low.  No.  But you would think the muscles that contract, that push it out are probably in great shape. 
[00:10:30]  Probably the best muscles on your whole body.  The only ones.  And I know the next time I'm saying this, so someone's going to want to hook up somewhere  down the road.  And it's just going to be like melted Gouda in my pubes.  So you hit yourself in the eye.  And it burns.  I've always joked about that, but I understand how women feel because I've done that before  many times.  And I shot, and as soon as I felt that splash, I'm like, ah!  And I just, on the towel, I went and took the contact out, but I was finished.  It'll be for a day or two. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your eye will be that red for a day or two.  Yeah, it's a war wound.  It happens.  A war wound.  You want to play rough?  That's what happens.  Play with the big boys.  Absolutely.  I mean, did Ollie cry when Norton broke his jaw?  He kept on fighting.  No.  You keep fighting.  That's what I do.  You get right back in there.  Right back in the game.  Got two eyes.  Mark in Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma just taking over this radio program.  They really are.  Big fans.  What's up, Mark?  That's because we're a repressed society here.  Too many Bible thumpers.  Yeah.  I had a question for you, Jimmy. 
[00:11:30]  Sure.  Normally, when I'm whacking my bag, my eyes are scrunched closed tight.  Do you just like watching it shoot out or something?  No, no.  I was with a person, but no, I don't close my eyes, dude.  I don't know why.  I get into a weird zone when I'm doing that.  It's like some kind of a stupid trance.  I've actually caught myself.  I've actually had moments of clarity while I'm doing it, and it's not pretty.  I'm sitting naked in my stupid computer chair, one hand tweaking a nipple, just zoning  out like a chimp, just eyes kind of half open. 
[00:12:00]  Awful.  I don't get the tweaking of the nipple thing.  I wish I didn't either.  Believe me.  I really don't.  No.  I got a girl here at work that's turned on by you, Jimmy.  Really?  Yeah.  I explained the whole deal with Dino, the pooping on the chest.  Oh, Jesus, dude.  All that junk.  I'm sorry.  I've got to be honest.  I don't want her to be surprised.  I don't want her to be surprised.  What do you think?  You spring that on a person?  Yeah.  She's interested, though.  She heard you yesterday talking about your date that didn't go through, and she's all 
[00:12:30]  that poor guy and all this stuff.  Man, she sat out in the truck and listened to you, and I showed her what you look like  on the computer and everything.  Well, he's kind of cute.  That's nice.  All right.  What does she look like?  5'7", about 125, dark brown, shoulder-laked hair, blue eyes, probably 32, 33, D, poop.  What does she eat? 
[00:13:00]  You got me, dude.  Thank you.  I'll ever see you're eating salad.  All right, Mark.  Thank you, Mark.  Bye, sweetie.  Can you wear an eye patch so we aren't distracted today?  I may have to put the shades on because this way it keeps the sunlight.  My eyes are very sensitive to sunlight.  You look just like Tom Cruise now.  I kind of feel like I'm in a weird way.  I would rather a pirate patch.  I guess we're distracted by the news now.  They're showing some clips that have happened on live television because of that shooting 
[00:13:30]  yesterday.  Yeah.  You were telling me more about that shooting that we were watching yesterday morning.  That was a great one.  Because we couldn't understand why the cops shot the guy.  It didn't look like he was being a threat, but now you're telling me that he had a gun?  Yeah.  Long Beach, California, yesterday they were chasing some guy.  Cops were chasing him.  And he ran into a guardrail and then he, oh, they're showing some great wrecks on ABC.  This is all from yesterday?  On ABC.  No, they're just kind of showing a whole thing.  I'm sure they're doing a whole story on how does live TV, these live chases and shootouts 
[00:14:00]  affect us?  Should they show them actually live or should we be on a tape delay?  This is the guy from yesterday.  He hits that guardrail and then they finally get him cornered.  He gets out of his car.  The cops start shooting at him.  He drops his gun.  I didn't even see the gun when he got out of the car, but apparently when they shot at  him, he kind of falls down and his gun goes sliding across the parking lot.  He looks at his gun sliding away like, oh, shit. 
[00:14:30]  And then he's sitting down in the parking lot and real quickly he digs his hand into his  pants to try to pull out another weapon.  He's got another gun in there.  So he's kind of looking up at the cops and really fast trying to pull another weapon out  of his pocket and boom, boom, boom, boom.  Good.  Bye-bye.  Have they ever put out a Greatest Hits tape yet?  Now that would be something.  Greatest police.  Not the ones they show, the police chases and stuff on TV.  The real ones.  The snuff films.  Yeah.  Where they're pretty much just people dying. 
[00:15:00]  Remember that guy in the tank?  I think it was San Diego.  Oh, that was the best.  He stole a tank and was driving around just crushing vehicles, just running shit over  and it was amazing.  Pulverizing.  There was a motorhome parked in front of someone's house.  He went through it like it was nothing with a tank.  Then he got hung up on a barrier in between a highway and they rushed to the tank, got the  lid opened up and just fired down into it.  Boom, boom, boom.  Wasn't that in, honestly, wasn't it one of those in Virginia that happened too, or D.C.?  Recently there was a bulldozer, saw that one recently. 
[00:15:30]  Another tank?  I don't know why I'm thinking that's D.C. or Virginia.  I could be wrong.  How often do they get tanks?  Yeah, I don't think you're going to see another tank anytime soon.  I think they battened down the whole tank thing after that happened.  Yeah, that was one of those rare moments.  I was interested in one, but the parking rates are astronomical.  Give me those ribs, you.  Let's go to Joe in Baltimore.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy, you're not alone, man.  Thank you, Joe in Baltimore.  Done the same thing. 
[00:16:00]  Did you try eye drops?  Yeah, just a regular one.  I don't mess with visine, man, so I'll be okay.  They usually clear it up right away, man.  Dry red jism eyes.  Try clear eyes.  All right, Joe, thank you.  That's funny.  Gets the load out of your eye.  Wow.  I had no idea your sperm burns like that.  No clue, man.  It's a weird thing, dude.  Yeah, it's a weird thing.  Paul on Long Island, what's up?  Does it burn as much as other people's? 
[00:16:30]  I wouldn't know.  Good answer.  What kind of punk moves his mouth away at the last minute?  Jesus.  Hey.  Hey, Paul.  You need to get your ass on the Home Depot and get a pair of safety goggles.  There you go.  Dude, it really is awful.  Okay.  All right, they're going at it here.  Greg in Georgia.  Everyone has a comment about Jimmy's eye from all over the country.  Go ahead, Greg.  Hey, my meaty-breasted little friend.  Yes.  Just wanted to let you know it's better sperm than a log in your eye.  I thought for sure that's where you were headed. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, dude, Jesus.  I can't believe I heard you here.  A log in the chest is okay, but someone suggests you might have had a log in your eye.  Now they're getting outrageous.  Just that's what I'm trying to say.  You raise a good point, O.  Seth, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy.  How you doing, man?  Hey.  Oh, hey, Jim.  I actually want to know if you knew you actually gave yourself what's called an angry pirate.  Do you know what that is?  It's actually like you're doing your business and you bust a nut in your eye and you go,  arrr, and you cover your eye out.  Arr, arrr. 
[00:17:30]  Arr.  Be careful next time.  Maybe the patch would fit the suit much better there than giving yourself an angry pirate there.  Oh, that's hilarious, man.  Brand new screen name up for grabs on whackbag.com and opianthony.net.  Angry pirate.  Let's go to Bill in PA.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, Jimmy.  You've got to put up the blast shield.  I always use my left hand to make sure it doesn't come all the way up and go up my nose like it did one time.  I have done that so many times.  Up your nose?  No, no, no.  The hand in front of the face, the left hand. 
[00:18:00]  Really?  It wasn't the way it was.  The defensive move.  It's unbelievable.  Where it goes through your hand and into your face, and the cops will go, yeah, there was a defensive wound.  Yeah, we believe the genitals shot first.  He's got wounds.  He's got defense wounds, like knife wounds on my hands.  Yeah, on your hands.  You have defense wounds on your hands.  Arrest my cock.  You've got to do matrix moves to make sure the sperm doesn't hit him in the face.  Jesus.  You see bullet time.  The thing flying toward his head.  Jimmy's rolling over.  Just missing.  Just skims his head. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, but I've done that left hand in front of the face for many, and I've been with girls,  and I know that they think, what's he doing?  That's kind of weird, but that's, you know.  Why don't you just, like, move your cock a little the other way?  Because if I, a little the other way.  Kind of move it a little to one side of the other, or.  I could.  It hits the pillow, though.  That's what I hate when it hits the pillow.  Like, how about pulling it closer to your abdomen so it kind of skims your lower abdomen?  That's the way I go.  I mean, you probably could, but I'm going pretty straight towards me, like, that way.  I don't go straight up and down.  I go kind of towards me. 
[00:19:00]  If it got your eye, it would have had to arc.  No, no, no.  Yesterday, it did not.  It was.  Oh, my God.  It just fired straight, headlong, right into your eyeball.  It was like one of those Maguire home runs that would clear the fence by three feet.  Like a line drive.  A screaming line drive.  God, a lot of people are very impressed today.  If I get it, like, on the upper chest, I'm very happy.  There's not even a chance I'm getting as high as my neck and my face.  You could do it on purpose.  You could hold back. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  You hold as long as possible, and then you got to do the squeeze, the upward stroke, and the bam, right at the right moment.  You know, you could do it like a porn star.  And punch your testicle all at the same time.  Like one of those carnival games.  Exactly.  Yeah, sure.  Let's go to Jim in the city.  What's up, Jim?  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Marty.  Did you have to commute into the city today?  A whole long commute. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, Jimmy, you feel like Tom Cruise.  Why, was Bob Kelly there?  We all know Tom's gang and shit.  All right, hit the car crash.  Bye.  Wow.  No, I can't.  I'm too dumbfounded to even hit it.  Did anyone know what he meant?  No.  I said that before about Tom Cruise.  He said Tom Cruise with the glasses, and I joked about the seed in the eye.  Yeah, but why the Bob Kelly reference?  I don't know.  Maybe because the eyes were red and sore?  Who knows?  The videos, by the way, are really funny. 
[00:20:30]  Did you watch the video of Bob Kelly throwing up?  Oh, yeah.  That's because of Sandy Cain's asshole?  It's some of the funnier stuff that we've had up on the websites.  But that statement just summed up the program.  You guys see the video last time of Bob Kelly throwing up because of Sandy Cain's asshole?  Make that into a promo.  Yeah, that is the show, isn't it?  That represents the show.  There's our 10-second commercial for TV.  No wonder we're not in any of their commercials.  What awful people we are. 
[00:21:00]  Awful.  Oh, listening to 1010 Wins on the way in, and I'm like, why aren't we part of this XM commercial?  And that's pretty much it.  Yeah.  They have, like, this whole little commercial I listen to on Wins, and it's the Kramer family, I guess, has bought XM.  Right.  And it's like Mr. Kramer enjoys, what's his name?  Bob Edwards.  Bob Edwards, that's right.  I couldn't even remember his name.  We should take a poll today.  No one cares about Bob Edwards. 
[00:21:30]  Bob Edwards.  Dude, I've been in radio for, I don't know, 20-some-odd years now, if you count college and all that.  Yeah.  When did you start when you were five?  And I never even heard of the guy.  I know he's a big deal as far as NPR radio goes, but no one cares in the end.  Man, people aren't running out to buy XM because they hear a Bob Edwards commercial.  No.  They're just not.  They've got to get their heads out of their asses as far as marketing the XM.  If you don't want us in the commercials for whatever reason, whatever, I'm not going to argue that point. 
[00:22:00]  You know, that's your call.  But to think that Bob Edwards is going to be bringing, you know, a boatload of people to the platform.  The Bob Edwards.  You're nuts.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  So they go, Mr. Kramer enjoys Bob Edwards.  And you hear, hi, this is Bob Edwards.  That's pretty much it.  And then they go, can you do that line again?  This is how it should have went.  I'll actually do it.  Mr. Kramer enjoys Bob Edwards. 
[00:22:30]  Hi, it's the Bob Edwards show.  That's pretty much what you hear.  And then, and his son enjoys, now, you would think Opie and Anthony would fit in fine there.  Nice contrast.  Perfect contrast.  Stuffy father that listens to Bob Edwards.  And then you get, you get the son listens to the Opie and Anthony show.  And his son enjoys Major League Baseball.  Now, that's not really a contrast, though, because the father would also enjoy Major League Baseball.  For the most part, it's not one of those things a father and son couldn't enjoy together. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  It's not like baseball is a father-son type of sport, you know?  And the father, Mr. Kramer, enjoys classical music.  And they hear some classical music.  And his son enjoys hip-hop.  And you hear the hip-hop.  Yeah, they were doing the whole contrast thing.  Oh, it was father-son, father-son?  Yeah.  Wow.  And I'm thinking, well, that would have been a perfect opportunity if you want to add in the Bob Edwards for the father to add in Opie and Anthony for the son.  And no, of course not. 
[00:23:30]  Well, that's sad.  They'll figure that out.  That'll be the next thing I hope they figure out down in Washington.  I mean, we are moving forward.  Everything's working nicely now.  I guess XM's going to reach 4 million subs very, very soon.  We'll never be part of commercials like that, too.  We never will be.  We'll build our own following the hard way, just like the old days.  I've accepted it, but I don't like the idea that they don't acknowledge it as something.  Right.  Because I think it's an absolute, it's something that's going on. 
[00:24:00]  We aren't part of those commercials, and it's not by just somebody's oversight at this point.  And I truly believe that.  Okay.  We should have been part of that commercial.  Of course we should.  We weren't.  Oh, well.  Here we are, though.  I love when they do their little surveys, too, because I know that the Opie and Anthony  show will turn out to be one of the most listened-to channels on the platform.  So we do it ourselves, like we always have. 
[00:24:30]  Thank you.  And Bob Edwards, he's in every commercial.  I know.  Every single commercial, advertisement, anything for XM, you will see Bob Edwards' name.  You will hear it.  You will hear part of his program on TV commercials.  So there, you, absolutely, and I defy you to show me listeners for that, God damn.  They're banking an awful lot on Bob Edwards.  They absolutely are.  Which is showing that there's a lot of people down there in Washington that are out of touch.  I don't get it. 
[00:25:00]  They're completely out of touch.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, if you did a survey, no one really cares that he's on the platform.  It's great to have on XM because it's part of the diversity that XM offers.  Of course.  Fine.  Is he getting some kind of audience?  I'm sure he is.  But you might as well advertise the Polka channel on every goddamn XM commercial.  How many people in their car are listening to 1010 Winds this morning, here's that commercial,  and they're running right to Best Buy right now.  Oh, my God.  I've got to get the Bob Edwards show.  Bob Edwards.  Okay.  Let me get that.  No.  Plus the fact he only does a one-hour show.  One hour. 
[00:25:30]  One hour.  One hour.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Banking a lot on him.  One guy.  Yeah.  Which I don't think any company should do.  That's the big mistake the little doggie company is making with the Howard thing.  You can't bank your whole service on one show.  You just can't do it.  It's only a half a billion dollars that they're paying him.  That's it.  So why not?  Hey, I wonder if, is it possible, because a lot of times, I know I've been accused of  overreacting.  At times, I actually do.  So maybe we could get somebody from Washington on the phone and ask honestly and openly. 
[00:26:00]  Not in accusing, like, yelling at them way, but there may be a valid reason for it.  Maybe someone from marketing would talk and not in some kind of educational way.  I know why we're not included in commercials like that.  They want to present it as, you know, family.  They want to be able to play the commercial anywhere, which I'm not even saying you have  to go Opie and Anthony and then have us on there cursing.  It could just be, hey, welcome to the show and our own voices.  And, you know, that's it.  It's the only show, yeah. 
[00:26:30]  But just having our names on there is a little too shocking.  And that's why we're not included in the commercials.  That's absolutely why.  Just our names alone are too shocking to put on commercials for XM because people listen  and go, oh, those guys, oh, weren't they, and why should we buy this, and it would create  problems.  That would be what they would say.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, okay.  Yeah.  That's it.  Quick.  Call him a chameleon.  Quick.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:27:00]  I'm not even, it's, what are you going to do?  Just smile and shake his hand?  Hey, how are you?  Good to see you.  That's it.  Yeah, no, I know.  I hear you've been really into it.  I completely accept it, and actually, I don't mind it at all because when we become successful  like we have in the past, no matter where we've gone, it's always been on our own terms,  our own merits.  We've always made our own space for ourselves and made our own success and had nobody to  look at and say, well, if it wasn't for that person, we would be fucked because we've always 
[00:27:30]  done it on our own, and I kind of like being in that position, so fuck them.  That's what I say.  Well, maybe we could get one of them on the phone today and ask, and I mean that sincerely,  and not be dicks about it, and not yell.  There actually may be a rational explanation.  Jimmy, Jimmy, it's their loss.  Good point.  It's their loss.  I don't care.  I don't care.  They didn't know what they had when they signed us.  No.  I remember kind of celebrating with a certain person, lawyer lady, and she couldn't wait 
[00:28:00]  to leave our dinner because she was so excited that she signed Bob Edwards.  Bob Edwards.  And that's when I went, what?  Bob Edwards?  What?  Yeah.  That's a who cares hire.  That just helps the whole platform.  You know?  We're the retarded child that has to be kept out of the family photos.  That's it.  That's what this show is.  That's true.  I'm sure.  Maybe Eric Logan will call.  We didn't talk to Elo in a while.  I kind of missed Elo. 
[00:28:30]  Ah, yeah.  All right.  Want to take our first break and then we'll get into the landslide.  Landslide?  There was a landslide?  Landslide.  Landslide.  The news coverage on this thing yesterday, unbelievable.  The special reports, the cut-ins, the anchors trying their best to keep this conversation  going and going, experts on the phones.  I saw a live, bro.  I swear to God.  I'm at 57th.  I'm going home.  And I had to divert to the right. 
[00:29:00]  I was in traffic on 11th, so I wanted to go to West Side Highway and go down south.  So I see a live.  The cops had the West Side Highway north.  I saw that shot, by the way, on TV.  They had it right there, blocked off.  I was so tempted, as I was making the right, to scream Opie and Anthony at the guy, and  I just fagged out.  So you guys that do the assaults on the media, I have respect for you.  I just kind of fagged out because I don't want to attract attention to myself because  my car has a 2004 inspection sticker on it.  That's what I tell myself now.  But I was just afraid.  You were too afraid.  But I really should have done that. 
[00:29:30]  You should have.  Because I heard him trying to stretch it.  The police have it all roped off here, or they're blocked off, and all of a sudden  the cops just wave people through.  And we're watching on live TV as traffic is now going through.  I watched that, and I was looking at the cars, and I could have seen you.  It was CBS, I believe.  It was CBS.  Yeah, it was.  I saw it.  It goes, live here on CBS, you're watching, because it was a big deal that they had caught  it exactly when they started letting traffic through.  Yeah, I was right there.  So it was like a big exclusive thing.  You were right there.  Why didn't I yell at you?  God, that would have been funny.  I would have laughed my balls.  Look at Jimmy. 
[00:30:00]  God, I'm like, what is this?  I was watching.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What is that, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  I don't know.  What is this?  There's a blueberry muffin.  What's wrong with the blueberry muffin?  I don't know.  Ricky.  When have I ever brought you a blueberry muffin?  Maybe it wasn't young Ricky.  What's this?  What is that?  I told Ricky to get you.  I was on the phone, and I said, get him a blueberry muffin, or, I mean, a blueberry yogurt.  And he said, okay, so I guess he got you both.  Oh, a bowl.  There you go.  Oh, because. 
[00:30:30]  Blueberry muffins are very tasty.  I fixed myself.  I said, I mean a blueberry yogurt.  Somebody else did it.  I'm going to get it.  A banana is what I wanted.  I told him a banana.  No, you didn't.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're right, Ricky.  I didn't tell you.  I have a banana every day, Ricky.  I love the Ricky.  I love the Ricky.  Have you seen the latest, the stool in the office?  Yeah.  We have a stool in the office.  It's your standard tubular steel and padded little foam disc top barstool type stool. 
[00:31:00]  And there it is.  Now, I guess Danny sat down on this yesterday, and it collapsed.  Yeah.  Uh, we were then told that Ricky assembled this stool.  It came all disassembled, and it's got your basic screws and nuts and bolts, and Ricky  had assembled it, and it's been falling apart ever since.  How?  It took him three hours, by the way. 
[00:31:30]  Look at this stool.  It's four legs.  Not even.  It's like two legs are connected, so it's like two pieces that are the legs, and one round  ring that fastens the bottom of the legs together around the middle of the stool, and the stool  seat.  A total of, what, four, eight, nine screws and nuts and bolts?  Yeah.  I've been sitting on this thing for a couple months, and just bolts have fallen out.  They've just been falling out. 
[00:32:00]  One a week or so.  One a week.  Yeah, you can see where they're just missing, and...  Hey, Ricky, how you doing?  Hey.  You assembled the stool?  Yes, I tried to.  And did you use tools, or just hand-tighten?  Uh, hand-tighten with a screwdriver.  This thing was hard to assemble anyway, because this thing could barely...  It barely, like, fit into itself anyway.  What do you mean?  Like, uh...  These legs right down here, they could barely, like, hold this loop, so I had to, like,  kind of stretch out the legs in order to get this, this, uh... 
[00:32:30]  The foot part here to screw on together.  The top part was fine, but...  Did you back...  Did you back up the bolts with, like, a wrench as you screwdriver...  As you used a screwdriver?  Yeah.  And you made them tight as you could?  Yeah.  You're claiming shoddy workmanship on the part of the company, basically.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Shoddy workmanship on the part of the company.  I wonder if every box of the stool came in also forgot a banana and accidentally put  in a muffin.  It could be.  It could be.  All right, well... 
[00:33:00]  You just assembled it the wrong way there, Ricky.  That's all.  All right, let's, uh, move on.  Ugh.  This kid's going nowhere.  Oh, poor Ricky.  Can I have a banana?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just go get bananas.  They say...  Are we going to make him wear the, uh, blow-up doll skin today, by the way?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We, we actually have the blow-up doll over there.  Uh, Steve chopped the head off of, uh, really, one of those cheesy plastic blow-up dolls the  other day.  And, um, we, we've slid it up the back, so it's like a little suit. 
[00:33:30]  And kind of like Silence of the Lambs, we want Ricky to put it on and wear the, the naked  lady suit.  Yeah, they say if you sat Ricky at a typewriter and just let him poke numbers in a million years,  he'd randomly type out a Bible.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Interesting.  We ought to give that a try.  All right.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  We're going to break, regroup.  We'll talk about the landslide next. 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  Also, we got the, uh, the grandma sex lady.  We got some more clips from her.  Oh, some more audio from that pervert.  And, of course, we got another 27 tracks of, uh, the psycho ex-girlfriend today, Anthony.  Stephen Lynch coming in.  Pepper from COC.  COC, and, of course, Joe Perry, all on the Opie and Anthony program this morning.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the only day of violence.  We want you to show Bob.  You've got to show the hemorrhoids.  Yeah, turn on the lights because we've got to make sure the area is lit up nice for Bob. 
[00:34:30]  The hemorrhoid, you've got to show the hemorrhoid.  Robert Kelly, you're going to have to limp over there because you've got to get a close-up.  Oh, what's more? What happened, man?  We've all looked at it.  I've got 20, 20 visions.  You don't have to touch it. You've got to look, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Robert, I'm sorry, baby, but that show did.  If she's apologizing about her hemorrhoid, it must be bad.  It's cute. It's not even out today, I'm sure.  If I would have known, I would have had Mexican food. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, where should Bob go?  Yeah, I think Bob should be to your right, Jimmy.  Dildo, man.  Right to the right of Jimmy.  Do you like him or what?  Jimmy, help him with the microphone for his reaction.  Don't be a dick, Dildo.  All right, Robert, grab that mic. That's yours now. Jimmy's moving over there.  My protection, my bodyguard.  All right, Sandy, focus.  My side dick.  Focus.  Focus.  Focus.  Okay, folks, thank you.  All right, show him the hemorrhoid in the back door first.  All right?  Do you have any music, maybe? 
[00:35:30]  Any music she could dance to?  Anything she could dance to?  I love dicks.  Can you play I love dicks?  Look at the bush.  I love how the bush comes out the side of that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  That's Twato's side.  All right, don't show Twato yet.  On television, I usually, you know...  You favor the other side.  I don't like the show Twato, but on this show, it's a must.  It's a must on this show.  I mean...  Doesn't it look like Larry Fine's head?  That's great.  She has the pubic hair fucking schedule of the Yeti. 
[00:36:00]  Hey, I'm warning you.  All right, we got some music for you here.  Hey, I've got a growth on my head, Moe.  Are you turning off the lights there, Danny?  Turn back on, Danny.  All right, we got music for her.  Sandy came to dance to.  Okay, good.  Here we go.  All right.  All right, the music's playing.  I'm ready.  I think it's going to kill you.  Kill me a blood.  Whatever that's morning over there.  This will cure you.  My hemorrhoid, my asshole, will cure you.  You mean cure me?  Whatever's wrong.  Turn around. 
[00:36:30]  Turn around and kill my asshole.  When you see my asshole, you'll be cured.  All right, well...  Yeah, you got to spread them now.  Take a look.  Look down there.  Oh, no.  Bob, hold on.  Get him a garbage pill.  He's in the garbage.  Look, Bob.  Look up there, Bob.  Bob, look up.  Bob, Bob, he's throwing up.  He's laying in the studio.  Bob, you...  Bob, you...  Down goes Bob.  Down goes Bob.  He has to leave. 
[00:37:00]  His face was beet red.  Fear factor here.  We got the fear factor.  His face was beet red, and he ran out of here, clutching that cane.  Hey, Eric.  He's dragging his leg.  Hey, Eric.  You want to take the thing of vomit with you?  Yeah, get the dude's fucking out of here.  He ramps the camera and leaves.  Holy shit.  What a vomit smells.  What is this?  He's beautiful.  What a man.  Oh, my God.  What a man.  You made him vomit.  What a man.  Boy, he has a strong stomach.  Oh, wait.  Wait, Eric can't follow Bob out of the studio. 
[00:37:30]  Now I'm going to need therapy on this.  Eric, what's going on?  He's throwing up in the toilet.  Listen, listen.  Oh, he dropped his thing.  Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  He really can't take this.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[00:38:00]  Ah, it's the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:38:30]  Hello.  What's going on?  So Susan Smith has a personal, yeah, little personal ad. 
[00:39:00]  You know how a lot of the incarcerated put out these personal ads?  They want you to write to them, spark up little relationships.  Little pen pal action.  Turns into a little love, and then the next thing you know,  you're marrying somebody who's serving a life sentence.  And then your life becomes trying to get that person out of prison.  Sorry, a little bagel in my face.  Isn't that right there, sweetie?  Yeah.  A little crunchy bagel dust in my throat. 
[00:39:30]  Let's see.  I'm 31 years old.  My birthday is September 26th.  I'm looking to meet new people and hopefully become friends.  During my spare time, I enjoy reading, working on puzzles, and writing.  I love rainbows, Mickey Mouse, the beach, the mountains, and waterfalls.  You would think anything with water wouldn't be in this woman's...  You know, or Mickey Mouse, reminding you of childhood.  How about not that?  She should say, I love old people. 
[00:40:00]  I love orthopedic shoes and walkers.  And the desert.  Love cactuses.  My favorite color is navy blue, and my favorite flower is the daisy.  Oof.  I'm a Christian, and I enjoy attending church.  I consider myself to be sensitive, caring, and kind-hearted.  Oh, my God.  She rolled her kids into a lake.  Say, why is Mom standing on the... 
[00:40:30]  Mommy, what the heck is she?  I'm too young to understand why I can't breathe.  Hey, we going backwards.  You know that our kids would be 14 and 11?  Backwards.  14 and 11.  Really?  Wow.  They would be.  Wow.  Not anymore. 
[00:41:00]  I thought that her favorite color is navy blue.  Perfect.  Jesus.  Because navy blue is never the top of the water.  Yes!  It's usually like 15 to 20 feet down.  Nice dark blue.  And that's a picture she's allowed to take from prison?  Yep.  For the personal ad?  Yeah, how's she looking?  Can somebody explain to me how you murder your children,  and some idiot in this society thinks it's appropriate you should be able to put an ad online  or have any computer access whatsoever?  Yeah.  Any access to the outside world.  How is that?  You should just be shut in a vault until you die. 
[00:41:30]  You should be able to read a paper, and that same paper is what you should be forced to eat  and use to wipe your ass.  So enjoy it.  Let's see.  And kind-hearted.  Yes, of course, she's kind-hearted.  I'm currently serving a life sentence on the charge of murder.  Ooh!  I have grown and matured a lot since my incarceration,  but I will always hurt for the pain I've caused so many, especially my children.  Especially, as opposed to who else, stupid?  Who else did she drown?  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:42:00]  What is there, a lake full of bodies somewhere?  Lake full of minivans at the bottom.  I hope to receive letters from those who are not judgmental and who are sincere.  I look forward to hearing from new people and hopefully finding new friends.  May God bless each one of you.  And then they have her address, the Leith Correctional Institute.  Well, let's start writing to her.  Maybe she'll write us back.  I'll write her.  That would be cool.  Write her a real letter, you know? 
[00:42:30]  Hey, you know, I'm not judgmental.  You'll write her, Jimmy?  Sure, I will.  I'll just say something.  I'll be very normal and not weird and say something like,  I don't judge what you did.  I realize that, you know, kids are pesky.  We should all try to write her a letter.  That'd be a good project.  Yeah, see who has the talent.  Good homework assignment.  Let's see who can pick up Susan Smith.  Yeah, let's see who gets a letter back from her.  I'll write one tonight.  I'll write one.  Yeah, I'll write one.  We'll send it out.  Let's write one up and see who can pick up Susan Smith.  All right.  Who gets the sexiest letter back. 
[00:43:00]  You know what would be really funny?  She sent back a picture in her bikini, and there was just a big bulge in the front of  her things, and I really did fall for her.  Yeah, Jimmy would be the one.  Dude, I finally found the girl.  Dude, I know.  It's been crazy lately.  But you know what?  I mean, she understands.  I don't want to have sex.  You know.  You know, she doesn't text message me and tell me she can't make it tonight.  Absolutely.  She doesn't nag.  I know where she is.  Always.  At least she has a good excuse to why she doesn't go to dinner with me. 
[00:43:30]  Exactly.  Look, I would have been at dinner, but I'm doing three life sentences.  Understandable.  And the car's in the lake.  Okay.  I understand.  I guess I should pick you up.  Ghetto D from the Bronx.  What's up, Ghetto D?  Yo.  What's up?  You guys are having a field day up in the Bronx today.  Oh, my God.  I think I'm a bomb, dude.  Huh?  I got nothing for you guys.  I'm a bomb.  I'm too stoned for this shit.  Yeah.  Yo, but yeah, hook me up with Susan Smith over there. 
[00:44:00]  I'll write to her.  Yeah.  Word up.  We'll give out the address in a couple days.  We got to try our, you know, we can't cock block ourselves here.  Everyone is asking for the address.  We'll give it to you in a couple days.  Let's go to Bubba in Alabama.  Bubba.  Hey, guys.  What's going home?  What's up, Bubba?  Man, the show's great.  I think they should take Susan Smith, like y'all said, just stay out and just shoot her  or whatever.  Yeah.  But I was wondering, guys, why y'all got new listeners on XM from the South that y'all  wanted to get on us about being so slow? 
[00:44:30]  Well, dude, we tease everybody.  The South, we tease each other.  I mean, look what I'm talking about.  I'm shooting myself in the face in a load.  I mean, everyone gets thrown into the bus, the South included.  I think in the end, if you become a fan of the show, you can't take it too seriously,  man.  Yeah, not at all.  We just smash everybody in the face.  Absolutely everyone.  Absolutely.  We don't care that you're a bunch of dummies.  You shouldn't either.  There's a stereotype of people from the South, and we adhere to that.  Yes.  Look at it and embrace it.  We went after Utah yesterday.  The show's spreading like wildfire through Alabama and the South. 
[00:45:00]  Everybody's talking about it, so y'all guys are doing great.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bubba.  All right, guys.  You might want to tell someone at XM because they're still focused on Bob Edwards.  Stupid Bob Edwards.  You ever listen to Bob Edwards, Bubba?  No.  Yeah, there you go.  There's no reason to listen to Bob Edwards.  Let's be honest with each other.  There you are.  Really good radio, man.  Y'all going to bring XM up in the stock market.  I appreciate it.  All right, Bubba.  I listened to NPR one time, and every time I get into a cab, it's all these dumb foreigners  listening to it, and it's just the most unlistenable radio. 
[00:45:30]  I mean, I'm sure it's very professionally done, and they're all good radio people.  It is dull.  That's what I'm saying.  Boring.  Why would you advertise a star of NPR radio?  Because XM is supposed to be this hip, cool, cutting-edge thing.  The technology is amazing.  It's getting better every day.  And you're banking on Bob Edwards, which is probably the dullest-sounding thing you could  listen to on XM. 
[00:46:00]  In a textbook, it's a good show.  It's monotone.  The whole show, the whole presentation, the production, it's all monotone.  So why would you want to focus on that thing?  When you say, we have Ohio Senator coming up, nothing on your show is exciting ever.  Wow.  No one wants to hear from him.  That would be exciting.  Just awful.  If you get a guy like Rush Limbaugh, who's like, at least can be mean.  I mean, look, I don't know if Bob is liberal or not.  I've never heard his show. 
[00:46:30]  Most liberal commentators, there's very few of them that are really fiery and exciting  or really funny.  Right.  Put a little emotion into what they're saying.  Yeah.  I mean, if you guys know of any, let me know.  I'm not saying there aren't any.  I just haven't heard them.  But that NPR, I think, is predominantly mostly left-wing and then mostly just very slow-paced  and at least Russ gets annoyed.  That's what I'm saying.  When I think XM, I'm thinking really hip, cutting edge, you know, a lot of variety.  You know, you can hear pretty much any form of music out there.  And then you're promoting a show that is monotone and just kind of old school. 
[00:47:00]  People listen to it.  And like I said before, it's great to have on the platform for the diversity.  Of course.  Most people, if they want to listen to that, it's available.  It's there.  But so is some of these music channels that are very eclectic that people go to and it's  great to have because it gives you variety.  But you wouldn't advertise it in your commercials.  You wouldn't say, we have, you know, I don't know, pick a music format that's just ridiculous. 
[00:47:30]  Audio visions.  Yeah.  You wouldn't push audio visions on every single commercial you do for XM.  Right.  That's pretty much what Bob Edwards.  That's what I'm trying to say.  That just shows there's a bunch of people down there still out of touch.  Yeah.  Out of touch as far as marketing this just amazing thing that is happening.  I mean, this satellite radio is going to destroy commercial radio as we know it.  And I'm quite happy that we could be a part of that to dismantle commercial radio.  Right.  But these guys got to wake up down there.  Wake up. 
[00:48:00]  You know.  It's not saying that you don't put like Bob Edwards or all the music stuff in commercials.  No one.  I mean, you know, I can see if you're like, hey, we only want Opie Anthony.  But just as a kind of a part of what's happening, why is that so hard to do?  Right.  Like Anthony, I've given up as far as them pushing us, you know, really, really hard.  But.  But.  I mean, you know, the Bob Edwards, that's just dumb.  Just dumb.  Mm-hmm.  You know, you could mention as an aside, like this, this, this, this, and this.  But to bank on it as the big thing, oof. 
[00:48:30]  The father likes this.  The son likes this.  The father likes that.  The son likes that.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Kevin and Jacksonville.  They could have done.  The father likes Bob Edwards.  The son likes some other thing.  Opie and Anthony.  Which would have been a perfect contrast, of course, because you're both opposite shows.  Your guys are, are, are, you know, a little bit high energy.  And his show is kind of like, you know, is audio melatonin.  And then, uh, they could have done it.  They both like baseball.  That would have been a clever trick.  There you go.  The father likes baseball.  The son also likes baseball.  I can't get enough of this fine-tuning station, by the way, that Lee Abrams turned us on to. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  What is it?  It's just, it's just all.  I hear you need pot, though.  Pretty much.  It's just all over the place, man.  They'll play a door song into some kind of, like, new age song into some classical song into, I mean, they're just all over.  You know, music from around the world.  I can't even describe it.  You like it.  I like it a lot when I'm just, you know, biking or just, you know, walking around and stuff.  Well, Lee has a really odd music thing.  I mean, he's the type of guy that if you say, I like Kiss, he'd call you a faggot and say, listen to Wicked Lester. 
[00:49:30]  That's the original.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kevin from Jacksonville.  What's up?  He's very eclectic.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, fella.  Hey, I'm from New York.  I live down here in Jacksonville, Florida now, down in the south.  I'm sitting on Interstate 10 in traffic.  Two loud stickers in front of me, one on the back of my Jeep.  Ah, nice.  So it's spreading down here, guys.  Cool.  I appreciate that.  Hey, have you guys ever heard of the morning show down here, Lex and Terry?  Yes. 
[00:50:00]  They're stick, as you call it, and they help you solve their problems?  Mm-hmm.  Hey.  They help you solve your problems?  I wonder if any of our listeners would call up because they have AIDS and get that problem solved.  Hey, you guys are spreading down here, though.  These guys are the big thing down here, and I'll tell you what, I can't stand them.  Well, they never really made it, to be honest with you.  I mean, you know, to be number one in Jacksonville, all right, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, show me number one in New York.  Show me number one in Boston.  Show me number one in Philly, Washington. 
[00:50:30]  L.A.  L.A. would be a good place, you know.  Jacksonville is like, no offense to you because you live there, but in the radio world, it's  like, eh, all right.  So you're number one in Jacksonville, great.  Sure, sure.  Yeah, they're always bagging on XM, though, because everybody's moving to XM.  Right.  But I'll tell you what, everybody I know down here, getting set up, wow stickers, people  are talking about you, so you guys are great.  Keep it up, man.  Yeah, you just watch how this grows.  You just watch.  All right, yeah, this is a good contrast, by the way.  John and Jersey, this is where we're being promoted. 
[00:51:00]  I forgot about this.  John.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, little Jimmy.  How's it going?  Hi, John.  All right.  I was in Coyote Ugly in the city in New York a couple weeks ago, and I go to the bathroom.  I'm looking at the urinal, and I'm standing there as I'm taking a piss, and it says on  the wall, and it's kind of like a on the bathroom wall type of advertisement, and it's  like some cutty, Opie and Anthony back on XM.  Whoever said they were bad and notorious were absolutely right. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  It was an awful ad.  Of course it was.  This is, well, this is, you know, this is how they advertise our show.  Bob Edwards, XM, I listened, and I heard them on 1010 Wins.  That's what I was listening to on the way in at the news station, and I heard that commercial  where we weren't included, Bob Edwards.  But ONA, yeah, we're in the urinals.  We're being advertised in the bathroom.  We're in the toilet.  See, XM is basically telling us what they think of us.  Yeah.  So if you're sticking your dick through a glory hole, you can brush up on where you can find 
[00:52:00]  the Opie and Anthony.  They just couldn't figure out how to get the advertising, you know, down below so they  could just piss on our faces.  Just piss on us.  Yeah.  Maybe we could put it in the bottom of the actual toilets in the stall so people could  just crap all over you guys.  Wouldn't that be good?  Right.  Because they had one good, one ad that I liked.  I mean, the bathroom advertising is actually a good little addition because people do use  it and see it.  That's true.  But the wording, I wish they would have given us a crack at the wording.  Because one of the things you're supposed to say, if you don't listen to Opie and Anthony, 
[00:52:30]  or if you don't like Opie and Anthony, shouldn't you be in the other bathroom?  But it shouldn't be a question, it should be a statement.  If you don't like Opie and Anthony, you belong in the other bathroom.  Yeah.  It's just like little things like that.  You're in the wrong bathroom.  Yes.  Something like that.  All right.  Let's get into some news here.  This landslide here in New York City.  Oh, huge story yesterday.  Yeah.  You'd think it was the end of the world here in New York, watching the various news stations  on television.  They all had their helicopters above the scene. 
[00:53:00]  Every station you went to, different helicopter view.  You need three or four helicopters up there.  Can't they all get the feed off of one chopper?  But they all have to have their own.  They're vying for position.  And you see some of them, I think they try to screw each other over, because you see  like the Fox helicopter cuts in front of the NBC helicopter, and they're trying to get  a view, and now they've got to move.  And then the ABC helicopter, it's like Vietnam over there.  I'm amazed that they don't crash into each other.  I've seen all these helicopters in the sky at the same time, and I don't know how they 
[00:53:30]  avoid each other.  Yeah.  I guess they have some laws as to how close they can get to each other.  And with the cameras they have, it really looks like they're close sometimes.  You know, they zoom in on that scene, and if a helicopter flies in the way, it looks  like it's right next to it.  But if you're driving around in the city, you can always tell where something's happening,  because you'll see five helicopters hovering over an area.  When I was driving in the other day, and they had that hand grenade thing go off on the  street, you can see helicopters all over the place. 
[00:54:00]  Well, did you hear, by the way, that they do know what caused the collapse?  Really?  They were digging out the rubble, and they found a portable, serious unit.  Really?  Apparently somebody dropped on the top of the ledge, and it just collapsed the whole thing.  Was that, and it just, it was too much weight for the wall to handle.  See, now that's the one theory, but I heard something else.  I heard that our own Ricky actually did the work on that wall.  In a previous life.  And, well, it was a little problem.  The wall was constructed back in 1908. 
[00:54:30]  Really?  Ugh.  Ugh.  The headlines, West Slide Story.  West Slide Story.  Ugh.  Chaos, but no casualties.  Yeah.  As wall with history of problems falls on Parkway.  Landslide, says the Daily News.  Collapsed wall buries stretch of Henry Hudson.  Amazingly, nobody hurt.  Amazingly.  A commuter nightmare for days.  And then the New York Post, West Slide Drive.  Dude, that is going to add 10 minutes to the bridge commute. 
[00:55:00]  Ah, at least.  Collapsed buries Hudson Parkway.  And then this little side note.  Glad my car got buried.  What is that about?  Some guy probably had a crappy car, and now, ah, there you go.  And he'll now get a lot of insurance money.  What?  Oh, bless you.  Bless you.  Allergy season is here, officially.  Well, the news, just trying to terrify everybody, of course.  They can't just report on a story.  This is a big New York story, landslide into a major highway during rush hour. 
[00:55:30]  You really don't have to go much further than that with this story.  But they just, I'm flipping through all the news stations, and they could not make enough  9-11 references.  They kept making reference to 9-11.  Why?  The equipment that's brought in, and the experts that are going to have to haul away this rubble,  this is very reminiscent of 9-11.  I heard that one.  Another one.  Are they bringing in infrared gear, heat-seeking, to find out if there are any survivors, or 
[00:56:00]  any of the dogs we saw at the World Trade Center site during 9-11?  They couldn't say it enough.  Just to tie it in and conjure up the terror in the people, because that's what the news  is all about.  Just getting that terror level up, scaring people.  I was waiting to see.  Could terrorists be responsible for the retaining walls coming down?  Are the retaining walls safe from terrorism in our area? 
[00:56:30]  And I'm sure that'll pop up in time.  Of course.  They'll get that angle.  What if they put explosives on the retaining walls?  They're saying no one was buried, but we're not too sure about that.  That was another thing.  The story is much more exciting if there's dead people.  Of course.  And the horror of maybe being trapped in a car under tons of rubble.  That's an exciting story.  What were some of the reporters saying, basically, about we're hoping to God no one was...  Yeah.  They're like, well, the fire department's down there. 
[00:57:00]  They're checking.  We're not sure if there are any people buried under there.  We're hoping...  We're all praying that no one is buried.  No, they're not.  Which is a lie.  They're not praying.  They are hoping.  They want death.  They want destruction.  Of course.  And then they're saying, well, we have no reports of serious injury or death.  They kept saying that.  And meanwhile, it was no report of any injury.  But they say serious.  So you keep tuning in and go, oh, there were injuries?  What type? 
[00:57:30]  They want the people panicked a little bit.  And then some firemen, actually, that saw it happen.  They were on the scene because there was a collapse earlier.  There was some rocks that fell.  And they showed up before this big landslide.  That's why there were no cars driving.  There was warning.  There were some rocks that fell down.  And no cars were passing there because there's rocks in the road.  When the news people heard that, they didn't even acknowledge it.  Because then they said, well, there aren't any cars buried under there because there was warning. 
[00:58:00]  Didn't even acknowledge it.  Well, they're coming in with, I think I saw a search and rescue dog.  And they are coming in with that equipment to see if there are any bodies under there.  The guy just told you he saw it.  There were no bodies under there.  But the news just loves it.  Turn up that panic level.  Turn it up.  Now, they're evacuating a building.  Is that building safe?  Could the building collapse?  Now that that's a breach in the wall, aren't the walls on either side of it taking more weight? 
[00:58:30]  Can't they collapse too?  Like they want to horrify people.  The days of real journalism are done.  And I tell you journalists, you're not doing the little dream you had about spreading news  and about whatever it is you dream of.  You're just a bunch of makeup-wearing frauds.  You're not real journalists.  You're not really reporting the news in an unbiased nature.  You really are, like Ann said, just trying to panic people and keep your ratings up and keep people watching.  It's not about being honest. 
[00:59:00]  It's not about telling the truth.  It's not about getting to the bottom of things.  It's just about you and your fucking pancake makeup face.  It's just entertainment.  And what they do, what the news is these days is over the long haul, they'll try to get the real story.  Sure.  Over the long haul, you got a story about maybe a political scandal.  They will do their damnedest to get every truthful detail out of it because that works for them, you know.  They're the ones that actually got this part of the story.  They dug up whatever scandal is involved.  But short-term things, disasters, they will throw bullshit out there every minute just to keep you tuned in. 
[00:59:30]  And then later on, they'll correct themselves and, you know, be able to sleep with themselves as journalists, I guess.  When no one cares.  When no one cares.  Right.  Exactly.  Because most of us will give up on this story within a day or two.  Yeah, yeah.  And then finally, the real facts will come out.  They'll come out.  Just part of the 11 o'clock news is like a 15-second thing.  They knew no one was dead.  People saw it.  There was never any danger to the rest of the wall, maybe. 
[01:00:00]  Like, over the long haul, they'll try to get it right.  We got some quick landslide news clips.  Should we play Landslide by Fleetwood Mac this morning?  And a retaining wall gives way in Washington Heights, collapsing onto one of New York City's most congested highways.  See?  See?  It was empty.  And why not?  The highway was empty.  Holy shit.  Was that a tease, by the way?  Was that a tease?  Oh, yeah.  Of course it was.  That conjures up an image of a traffic jam. 
[01:00:30]  Someone sitting in their car going,  As dirt and rocks pile on top of a congested highway.  You lying sack of shit.  Let's go back to that, too.  Well, let's play it first.  And a retaining wall gives way in Washington Heights, collapsing onto one of New York City's most congested highways.  All right, here's the deal.  You're at home on Long Island, Jersey, Westchester, all the surrounding areas of Manhattan.  And the other ones, whatever. 
[01:01:00]  You're at home.  You know your loved one is commuting.  Now you're in a complete panic.  A tizzy.  Complete panic.  A tizzy.  What major highway?  Is it the one that my loved one is on?  That's why they don't tell you.  So that's why they don't tell you.  So now everyone has to watch.  Oh, my God.  I'm affected.  Now it becomes, let's get the most people to watch and not let's inform the people as to what's going on.  That's their job, to inform the people, but not anymore.  Why don't you say West Side Highway?  Why do you have to say one of New York? 
[01:01:30]  Why not just say we collapse onto the West Side Highway?  Yeah.  They do this all the time.  I love the one.  All the time.  I love the one where they just fuck with the parents.  It's like, one of the toys that your kid could be playing with right now could kill them.  Could kill them.  We'll let you know what that toy is at 11 o'clock tonight.  And the weekend weather.  Right.  It's like, hey, Dick, my kid is in the other room playing with 100 toys.  Can you help me out here?  Pull them away.  Right.  Which one is going to kill them?  I've just grown to hate them.  I really have grown to.  It's like, you watch, it's corny, but you watch Cronkite reading JFK's news. 
[01:02:00]  It's like, that's what a, I don't know.  It was just a human to that.  I want a desk.  I want black and white.  I want a clock behind him.  And I want him reading off a paper.  That's what I want.  You know what turned me on to this whole thing was bullying for Columbine.  You know, say what you will about Michael Moore, whatever.  But that's a bunch of bullshit, too.  I'm not saying that.  But a lot of that movie was based on a book called Culture of Fear.  So instead of, you know, listening to Michael Moore's take on Culture of Fear, this book, 
[01:02:30]  he even interviewed the author during the movie.  I went and bought that book, read the whole thing, covered the cover.  Oh, yeah, that whole part of it.  That whole part of the movie was great.  It was amazing.  And it really opened my eyes up to what the media really does.  They scare people.  Their job now is to petrify you, to take the littlest threat and make it seem like this  can happen to you at any given moment, and take a disaster like this or a landslide like  this and make it sound like it's a huge disaster, that there could be death, destruction, it 
[01:03:00]  could happen to you.  They scare you.  Yeah, kind of like, I want to make a more point on how they did that with the AIDS scandal,  or how they do that with other certain things that happen, like biased crimes or hate crimes  against certain people.  Like, they don't blow that in a proportion to scare you?  Why is he pointing that out?  You know what, there was, I don't have my stats in front of me, but basically in Culture  of Fear, they do the whole Halloween thing, how every year the news people scare the crap  out of you that your kids can be poisoned by candy. 
[01:03:30]  Razor blades in the apples, things like that.  Yeah, and they did a study, and someone could help me out there, but they could only find  like four or five cases or something like that, that span like 20 or 30 years where  kids died from Halloween candy.  So the odds of it happening are much less than things like lightning strikes.  And then they went further into the stats, and they found out most of the children that  were poisoned by Halloween candy, it was done by a family member that was trying to get 
[01:04:00]  some insurance money, or just was a kook, or what have you.  Yeah.  But every year when Halloween hits, they'll scare the crap out of you that your kids are  in danger.  They can be poisoned by Halloween candy.  Yeah.  Or razor blades, or needles.  Needles, I never thought of that.  Just fear.  Just fear monger.  Let's go to Pete in Queens.  Pete, what's up?  Yeah, just one word, sensationalism.  You know, just listening to you guys, just a quick movie reference out of that Charlie Sheen  movie, what was it, The Chase?  Yeah.  I thought it was horrible, just the way, but the way they portrayed the sensationalism 
[01:04:30]  of The Chase and everything else.  But the original point of the call was, you know how they kept focusing in on a park?  You know, this channel just kept focusing, it's just inches from the park, and it was  filled with kids.  Off to the right of the landslide, there's a little playground.  Okay.  And they kept focusing on it, going, look how close this came to the playground, where children  were playing.  And, no, it's not. 
[01:05:00]  It didn't happen.  You know, a news director.  There's no reason to just pounce on it.  You know, a news director is sitting there going, why couldn't it be the playground?  Oh, if we'd have had children spilled with dirt and boulders and trees onto the highway,  would have been a great story.  Well, you keep touching on that.  Yeah, let's say hi to Eric in New Hampshire.  Eric?  Hey, Ope.  Hey, Ant.  What's up?  What's up, Cutcake?  Hi, Guy.  Hey, actually, I'm from Fox News.  And you're right, we do know what happened with the wall.  It was weakened last night when it was shot by Jimmy Norton's load. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, could one of Norton's loads have gone over his head, out the window, and perhaps  hit the retaining wall?  We'll tell you at 11.  A landslide buries a busy west side roadway under a massive mound of dirt and debris.  Busy.  A busy west side roadway.  That's the key.  A busy west side roadway.  That's the key.  It wasn't busy.  Oh, it can be busy.  I've been on that road where you're just sitting there in traffic forever.  It stinks.  But it wasn't busy at the time.  Of course it wasn't.  They wanted to make it sound like it's busy. 
[01:06:00]  Sure, that would have covered up probably 30 cars if it was busy.  It wasn't.  It covered up.  Perhaps the most amazing piece of information we can tell you tonight is that there are  no reports of injuries.  That came a lot later.  Of course.  Yeah, a lot later.  No reports.  We can hope and pray that there are injuries and deaths.  Well, this one kind of says that.  Amazingly, as far as we know tonight, nobody was trapped or injured underneath tons of dirt, 
[01:06:30]  debris, and trees.  As far as we know.  As far as we know.  Now, look, we could be wrong here.  Keep your fingers crossed and hopefully there are some dead people.  Everything came down.  The wall, the trees, everything.  He even took out a car on the highway.  What were you thinking?  Just to run.  What do you think he was thinking, you dummy?  Just to run.  To get out of the way.  What a dumb broad.  What a dumb question.  I hate the what are you thinking.  They were just... 
[01:07:00]  They didn't know what to do.  You get these anchors that are used to just reading off the teleprompter, reading the news.  They get a story like this as it's happening.  They're getting live phone calls coming in.  They have no clue how to improvise, how to ask questions.  I heard about five times from five different anchors, people on the phone.  They were asking them, so, what do you think of all this?  That's a question a news person is asking somebody?  What do you think?  What? 
[01:07:30]  It's a lot of dirt.  Right.  What do you think I'm thinking of this?  It's a landslide.  Okay.  What?  I'm thinking the same thing you're thinking.  I was thinking I wanted to go to a movie.  Yeah.  I'm thinking this could fuck up traffic.  I'm thinking, hmm, that's a big tree.  I'm thinking it's going to take a while to clean this up.  You know what I was, this is what I want to say.  You know what I was thinking?  Holy shit! 
[01:08:00]  There you go.  No one said that.  What do you think I was thinking?  Jesus Christ.  I was thinking, mother of God, the earth is ending.  Yeah.  But, now the most dangerous part of this whole thing.  Is the fact that traffic is now being detoured.  I know we're going to go, we're going to take this bit to the next level.  Yeah.  I just got a couple more teachers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I love it.  Love it.  I know where you're going.  It's shopping day in the Bronx. 
[01:08:30]  I was sitting at my computer.  I heard a rumble, which sounded like a truck getting stuck under the pedestrian bridge,  which happens occasionally.  There's a pedestrian bridge over the West Side Highway.  Then it was followed a few minutes later by a second rumble, much, much louder, which  sent my cat running for cover.  Faggot.  Be a man.  The cat scambored to it quickly.  It knocked my drug cocktail off the nightstand.  I thought it was something like a blast of some kind at first, but then everything just 
[01:09:00]  started coming down.  And then, as it was coming down, I saw the trees running down, like there was a cold wind  blowing it.  And it was just real scary, man.  It was real scary, man.  That's pretty interesting news.  I'm really glad they brought that guy on.  That really was important.  The firemen came and came to every apartment and told us to evacuate.  And we've been here ever since.  The elderly gathered outside on the makeshift couch, waiting, worried, forced out of their 
[01:09:30]  apartments by the wall, collapsed.  I want to get in to get my medicine.  I'm a diabetic, too.  You're going to lose a toll.  We were told to get into the tubes, that the blitz was coming.  Listen to that old English bag.  I can't believe it.  I can't get enough of this.  Do we have any more of these clips anywhere?  I've got to evacuate.  Oh, cock it.  Fuck.  This fucking twat comes to my fucking door. 
[01:10:00]  and says we've got to leave.  Fuck off.  Piss off, you wanker.  That's great.  I've got to get my medication.  There was a landslide.  Where?  Where?  You're kidding.  The Henry Hudson.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Oh, no.  I was just parking my car. 
[01:10:30]  I have diabetes in my toe.  Where?  Where?  Who is in this tree?  Who is in this tree?  Oh, they were yapping with all those old people.  Those old Bettys.  Old bags.  Jesus.  One, they evacuate the building.  Yeah.  For what? 
[01:11:00]  I don't know.  They're so overly safe these days with stuff like that.  And I guess they should be,  because if the one in a billion chance thing happens  and something happens to the building  and someone sues  and they find out that they didn't evacuate it,  there'd be problems.  So, they evacuate it.  And then they're talking to the people that were evacuated.  They give the all clear to send them back in.  And this woman is going,  I am not going back in.  I don't, I would not be able to sleep.  I don't feel safe. 
[01:11:30]  It was nowhere near the building.  You could see.  All right, it's a little landslide.  You could kind of look and see if anything else falls away,  where it's kind of going to come from.  Nowhere near the building.  But again, the news,  she was probably watching some of the news,  getting all scared.  Will the building collapse?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  So, they're saying,  this building we're showing you now,  being threatened by this landslide.  How great would that be 
[01:12:00]  if a building just collapsed  out on the West Side Highway?  Oh.  That would be newsworthy.  Ah, people spilling out on it.  God, why didn't I yell at that reporter yesterday?  You should have.  I'm such a fruit.  I was watching.  A little scared girl.  That was Jimmy Norton.  I hate people like this.  Carlos, it looks like, from Jersey.  I'm getting some feedback.  They showed a guy who said,  I eat lunch there on the side of the wall  almost every day.  I could have been killed.  The wall collapsed around four.  Who eats lunch at four?  He'll be telling this story  of how he almost died forever. 
[01:12:30]  What a tool.  Yeah, there's plenty of  World Trade Center people, too,  that have that story.  Jesus.  Enough.  Funniest bit on that ever,  Colin, right after it happened,  was talking about people  that have to put themselves with it.  Dude, you know,  if I would have taken the two train,  do you normally take the two train?  No, I've never taken the two train.  I'm just saying,  if I had become a broker,  instead of moving to Utica,  I'd be running a go-kart.  It was one of the funniest bits ever.  I've never seen Colin say that.  I don't know if I had a moment. 
[01:13:00]  You would have gone run a go-kart.  And he's like,  everyone thinks they have intuition,  and Colin goes,  you know,  something told me  not to go down there that day.  Yeah, stupid,  the news.  The news told me to go down there.  Oh, that was funny, man.  Oh, shit.  I sort of did that  in the office today,  I've got to admit.  Because, you know,  the west side...  You did do that today.  I've got to throw myself  under the bus a little bit here.  Under the dirt.  Go into the boulders.  The west side bike path  is awesome.  And, you know,  you could go rollerblading  or biking, jogging,  what have you. 
[01:13:30]  You could go all the way down  to Ground Zero  and all the way down  to Battery Park and back,  no problem, you know.  Yeah.  And where I get on the bike path,  sometimes I'll go right  instead of left.  And right will take you  where this whole thing happens.  Is there even a bike path  up there?  Oh, yeah.  The bike path goes all the way past  like the George Washington Bridge  heading north  from where I live.  Oh, yeah.  And I actually said  in the office,  you know,  I was thinking of going right,  but the last second  I decided to go left.  Oh.  Could have been me.  Right. 
[01:14:00]  Could have been me under there.  But all I was saying was,  I wish I went right  so I could have, you know,  seen this happen.  Seen it.  Because obviously  it didn't hit  the actual bike path anyway,  but let's go to Leslie  in New York.  Leslie, what's up?  Hi, Open Anthony  and Little Jimmy.  Hi, Leslie.  I just want to let you know  that this story  made it out into Ohio.  Well, yeah,  it's a national story.  Yeah, but my parents  were like,  oh, my God,  were you on that highway?  Are you okay?  I'm like,  Ma, I work in Westchester.  I don't go down that far.  So they were like, 
[01:14:30]  oh, we were so scared  because of the way  they presented it.  Yeah, well, there you go.  That's what the news does.  A busy highway.  But we're the scumbags.  Okay, sure.  Exactly.  So just wanted to let you know.  All right, thank you, Leslie.  My busy highway.  All right.  You know what we should do?  We should hit the  neighborhood news intro  and see, you know,  what other headlines  around America there are  as far as this tragedy goes.  All right.  Oh, let's see how the other...  Is there a paper out there  that could beat 
[01:15:00]  West Slide Story?  West Slide Story.  Ugh.  You know that guy  who came up with that  was all clever?  Walking around,  feeling clever  walking around the office  with his chest out.  See my headline?  That was mine.  West Slide Story.  It's all me, baby.  West Slide Story.  And then the post,  they were almost there.  They couldn't figure it out.  They have West Slide Drive.  West Slide Drive.  Almost made it.  No, you idiot.  West Slide Story,  if you're going to go  for the hokeyness.  Maybe they realized  that Newsday had...  Newsday was just  an awful paper. 
[01:15:30]  Maybe they realized  they had it first  and they had decided  to do this.  Yeah, Newsday is...  It's just a bore fest.  That paper stinks.  I like the Daily News, though,  because there's just  enough advertising,  which I really like.  Cool.  I like to have  11 straight pages  of fucking girdle ads.  Stupid rag.  Stop lying to your patrons  about lottery numbers.  All right, let's go to Ron  in Jersey.  I want with mines.  Oh, I hope they lose it.  Oh, and hey,  little Jimmy,  what's up, guys?  Hi, fella.  Yo, how about the way 
[01:16:00]  the news nowadays  sensationalizes the weather?  They're telling you  like 10 days from now,  like, there's going to be  a Northeaster  ripping up the East Coast  and then nothing happens,  but then they have  the whole tri-state area  in a freaking panic.  Right.  Yeah, especially when  they say Northeaster  and everyone's ever  heard of that.  North.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, guys.  Hey, have a good day, man.  Punch it out.  Bye.  Yeah, the weathermen  have to get involved.  This was a big story  yesterday,  in New York,  and the weathermen  had to get involved  and talk about how  the rains recently 
[01:16:30]  and maybe some of  the colder weather  we've had  and freezing  and thawing  could have caused this.  Really?  Really?  Because it hasn't been  raining and freezing  since 1908.  For 100 years  this wall has been there.  You idiots.  Stop it.  But the rain  was the culprit, right?  And then this was also  a huge day  for the traffic reporters  who are usually  just a little side note  on the news program  every day.  This was their moment  to shine.  They were interrupting  the anchors. 
[01:17:00]  The anchors usually  go to the traffic people  and then they're back.  They were like,  I have to cut in here  and tell you,  let's get the  chopper four shot  down the west side highway.  You could see  this traffic jam  extends 100 blocks  down Manhattan.  All right.  Well, no,  I also want to show you  some of the side streets.  It was their moment  to shine.  The traffic people  were interrupting  the anchors.  We have a guy  on a Saturn right now  who has to piss so bad  he's got a Starbucks  in his lap  and he's leaning over 
[01:17:30]  urinating into it  like he does a lot  when he cruises hookers.  It looks like he's  pondering yelling  something out the window  but he's dicking out.  Why isn't he yelling  O&A Party Rock?  He's a yellow belly.  Let's go to Todd  in Baltimore.  Todd?  What's up,  O&A Pumpkin Pie?  What's up, Todd?  Hey, did you guys  hear about that story  in Baltimore  where the white kid  beat up the black guy?  In Baltimore?  Yeah,  and he was up  for manslaughter too  and they let him off. 
[01:18:00]  So the whole community  is up in outrage now.  Hey, that has a lot  to do with what  we're talking about now.  Thank you.  That was good.  That was real good.  Actually, I don't  blame Todd at all.  No?  I'm looking deeply  into the room  where they screen  these phone calls.  Usually we try  to stay with the theme  for a little while  on the show.  I mean, we have ADD  ourselves.  We don't really need  the help of the listeners  to throw us off track.  No, it's how,  what's happening  in your town  but how they're reporting 
[01:18:30]  on the landslide,  not stories about,  yeah,  I guess we should have  made that more clear.  I thought it was  made pretty clear.  Did the big ragu  not get us?  The big ragu.  This just in  from John in Philly,  Rick Delgado  is feverishly  working on a song  parody about the tragedy.  A yield sign  right through her head.  Drive, you bastard, 
[01:19:00]  drive!  The west side highway,  it was a landslide.  That's funny.  It's all feverishly  thinking for a long line.  Child slavery,  what ties in with that one?  Oh, there's Al Roker.  Oh, is he by the landslide?  He's going up  in an air balloon.  Oh, he's going up  in a balloon.  Oh, why not?  Please,  high tension wires.  Something go wrong. 
[01:19:30]  I've seen these tanks  explode,  which is great,  and everyone jumps out  on fire.  You see him come down  on power lines.  How great would that be  if all they found of him  was his fat head  and that hat  fried to it?  That stupid  suede cowboy hat  fried to his head.  There they go.  Up, up, and away.  I don't like heights.  This would scare me.  Wow, this is...  I'm not into  the whole balloon thing.  You feel like you're  going to float forever.  Why would you want to...  Yeah, it's great.  So slow down. 
[01:20:00]  Wow, look at this dude.  Oh, wow, yeah.  I think we figured it out  a little better than balloons  these days, you know?  At the mercy of the winds,  which way are we going, Ken?  Right now we're heading  a little bit to the northeast.  Right now we're going  a mile an hour  to the northeast.  The other remex balloon  up there is in  and see if we can  transition back into the park  and not go out of the park.  Now, how far up  are we going to go?  We're going to go anywhere  from about 500 to 1,000 feet,  I would guess,  just to get the steerage  so we can stay over  at Chatfield State Park here.  How hot does this air get? 
[01:20:30]  How hot does this air get?  The air gets made hotter  is about 183 degrees  in the top of this balloon  right now.  Wow.  Just have Al talk  into that balloon  with his hot air.  He really tackles the issues.  The most amazing thing  I've ever done  and I want to thank  the Today Show  for this opportunity.  Is it what you thought  it was going to be?  I'd be afraid  if the Today Show  killed her and her son.  It'd be great  if you see someone  looking up  and they throw Al out  and hang him by the neck.  I never liked 
[01:21:00]  fucking Al Roker.  Do you expect me  to believe it was sunny  because Al Roker says so?  And just so people  get a sense,  I mean,  we've got a camera  up here in this balloon.  We've got a chase balloon  that we can see that.  A chase balloon.  Oh, wow.  There's a hell of a chase  going on there.  Wow.  That's exciting.  That's an exciting chase.  Two balloons chasing each other.  Al's in one balloon  and the man in the yellow hat  is in the other.  And the Today Show  wonders why 
[01:21:30]  Good Morning America  is nipping at their heels.  It's magical.  They're actually broadcasting  from a hot air balloon.  I'm okay.  Oh, what if you have  a problem with heights  or something?  I know I do.  It'll bother me.  I'd be in a panic.  I've been in a panic  once about 25 years ago.  Is that Al Roker's farting  or is that making...  They're lighting his ass  when he farted  for the balloon?  Yeah, I can hear you, Matt.  Yeah, we should explain  to people,  they don't usually see  hot air balloons  flying in the middle of the day  and, of course,  it's early morning  there in Colorado.  The reason for that  is wind, right? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, well, it's wind.  There's also FAA regulations  that you can take off  around sunrise  and, again,  around sunset.  And that's when  things are a lot calmer  and visibility's best.  And so that's why  you only see it  in the morning  or in the evening.  Meanwhile, Al,  you know,  I'm a little...  We don't fly  in the evening.  And they don't fly...  You don't fly in the evening here?  Here comes a great...  A great maybe question  from Katie Kirk.  Come on, Katie.  Come on, Katie.  Come on, Katie.  Give us something good. 
[01:22:30]  It looks so pretty.  Yeah, Ray,  can you turn around  and see?  There's a Denver skyline  over there.  Hey, Al.  Here it comes.  Listen to this.  You know it's going to be stupid.  Hold on a second.  The burner was going.  Were you saying something?  Yeah, hey, Al.  I was just saying,  you know,  it doesn't seem like  the basket  or whatever it's called  goes up very high.  Do people get nervous  that they're going to fall  out of the basket  because it's going to be  very high?  There it is.  You're right.  Wonderful question, Katie. 
[01:23:00]  And we don't need  the answer to that question.  Do people get the basket?  Do people get nervous  they're going to fall out  because the basket  doesn't look like  it goes up that high?  It's two inches  below the balloon,  you dumb whore.  I would assume  she meant  the sides of the basket  don't look like  they're very tall  instead of  doesn't look like  the basket's going up  that high.  I assume the basket's  going up as high  as the fucking balloon,  idiot.  Are people nervous 
[01:23:30]  they're going to fall out?  And this is why  the Today Show  is just plummeting  in the ratings.  Katie Korek stinks.  She's always been the worst.  Always.  I'd have more respect  for her if she said,  Al, a friend of mine  was telling me  that the balloon  sometimes will achieve  a certain height  but then if you're not careful  you've got to watch out  because you're right there.  Yes, Katie.  Certain heights  will be reached.  Here we go.  Pete from Miami.  What's up, Pete?  They're trying to create  weather situations 
[01:24:00]  to duplicate  the situation  in New York.  They're saying  if it rained  here we would have  they're pointing out  places that  could potentially  be dangerous  here in Miami.  It's a beautiful  sunny day  but they're telling us  that this could happen  here.  And this is like  it has nothing to do  with anything  that's going on  right now.  Do you even have  a wall in Miami?  I've been there  a few times.  Your walls are about  what, four or five feet high?  Yes, but there's  a lot of dirt  behind them. 
[01:24:30]  They're latching  onto it, man,  like a baby on a tin,  I'm telling you what.  You guys rock,  but thanks for anything.  I'm out.  I'm sure it happened  in Miami.  A landslide could cover  the front of your shoes.  Beware.  Jesus.  If the waters  wash up 30 Cubans  on a raft  maybe that would  knock a wall over.  Tim in California,  what's up?  Hey, man,  what's up?  Oh, hey.  Hey.  What's this, face?  Hey.  Hey, I hear the news,  Channel 4 News  out here was going,  yo, can this happen  in our city  down here in Los Angeles, 
[01:25:00]  you know?  Well, of course.  It has.  Of course it has.  They had a real one  that covered  a whole neighborhood.  Yeah, it happens  all the time.  We're ripping you guys  off.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  I invented the landslide,  Robin.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  California invented  the landslide.  New York's ripping  them off.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Yeah, it covered  a whole neighborhood.  Now, that was news.  All right, Anthony,  so why don't you get  to the other part  of this story  that kind of made us  chuckle this morning.  More dangerous  than the landslide itself, 
[01:25:30]  it sure is,  is now the detour,  which will take you  right through one  of the best neighborhoods  in New York.  We like to call it  We like to call it  Shwuggyville.  Oh, Jesus.  My goodness.  It's not the name.  Well, now,  traffic is being diverted  off of Henry Hudson.  So they diverted,  and we saw the map.  It takes you up Broadway,  uptown Broadway, 
[01:26:00]  and then, I guess,  past the area  that's affected  and then dumps you  back onto the Henry Hudson.  Yeah.  But that area of Broadway  that it takes you by  is now, today,  it's going to be  the homey car dealership  because they're just  going to be able  to take their pick.  There's going to be  a lot of traffic.  Yeah.  So there's going to be  a lot of cars  just stuck in traffic.  You're going to be  stopped there.  Now, this is the area  where myself or Opie  or Jimmy are driving  through it.  We don't pay attention 
[01:26:30]  to traffic lights.  No, we've talked  about this in the past.  Yeah, I never drive  up there,  but if somehow  I find myself stuck  there and the light's red,  I don't acknowledge.  No, you just keep going.  Because the idea  of being dragged  out of my vehicle  and having a toilet bowl  smashed over my head  as somebody dances  above me  is a little frightening.  So I just keep driving.  And the funny thing is  this highway takes care  of all these rich folks.  Right.  So they've got  some really nice cars  that are now driving  in the middle of an area  that people just  can't afford these cars. 
[01:27:00]  This is just one  of those areas  where you don't want  to drive.  And now people are  going to be  in stopped traffic.  Stopped traffic.  Yo, man,  you need your windshield waj?  And you know  the homies are going  to just F with people  all day long up there.  Oh, yeah.  That's where the cameras  should be.  Exactly.  That's where the news is.  That's the story  within the story.  We're getting reports  of injuries and deaths.  It's going to be  very scary  if you have to drive  to your palatial homes 
[01:27:30]  in Westchester  through that area.  Oh, I like that.  What is that?  An escalate?  All right.  We should step aside.  Stephen Lynch  is going to be joining  the program  in a little while.  Well, what's up?  I'm moving stuff around.  Okay.  When we get back,  Anthony,  why don't we play  some more clips  from the grandma  talking about sex?  We had fun with her yesterday.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Well, yeah.  I know that was a hard one. 
[01:28:00]  It's on!  I need to be  I need to be  I need to be  I need to make it  Oh, Leroy, Leroy.  I need to the head  I need to the drawing  I need to make it  I need to make it  I need to make it  I need to make it  Well, then what's that?  Yeah.  Which?  What?  Why?  Where?  Sure.  Why?  Why?  Who?  Oh, why?  We have problems.  I need to make it  I need to make it  Shake it up  Shake it up  Shake it up  Shake it up  Are you breathing?  Are you breathing?  Now, now, we go 
[01:28:30]  We keep alive  We keep listening to me  I'm gonna talk about the biggies  Now, someone is gonna die  We keep listening to me  Listen to me, die  Listen to me, die  Say, hey, guys  We keep alive  We keep listening to me  I'm gonna talk about the biggies  Now, someone is gonna die  Let's go right to the phones.  Say hi to Justin in San Francisco.  Justin, what's up today?  What up?  I think you guys ought to start a new feature called Anthony's Killer Line of the Day. 
[01:29:00]  Ooh, now put the pressure on me.  Thank you.  Well, yesterday you had the thumb wrestling one.  Today you had one.  Do you even know it?  No.  It's just as good.  Really?  Well, yeah, it was like 20 minutes into the show.  Jimmy's talking about jizzing into his eye.  And you're like, did it burn as much as other people's?  Dude.  I thought that was a throwaway.  See?  Some people pick up on things that I just don't even notice.  Well, thank you, sir.  We're taking Anthony for granted because I thought that was just kind of like a throwaway. 
[01:29:30]  You just wait.  He's going to beat that line today.  You'll see.  Oh, the pressure.  I don't know.  Somebody on Wack Bag, I hate to not give you credit, but I don't know who it is  because I really don't pay attention to you people.  You people.  They made an animation, a little flash animation thing, of somebody thumb wrestling with China's  clit.  Is it funny?  It's really funny.  It looks really good.  It's just the thumb moving around and the clit avoiding being pinned. 
[01:30:00]  Very funny.  That line yesterday just made me laugh all day long.  Hey, Anthony, CBS, shame on you.  Shame on you.  We've been talking about how hokey the news is.  I like the hand they had that shakes.  It's like scolding shame, shame.  Like pointing its finger at you.  Yeah.  And it's going shame, shame, shame.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.  I'm just waiting for one of these guys to get punched really hard in the face.  Well, now every, you know, every news channel, every news show has one of these things where 
[01:30:30]  they go out and, you know, help out you, the consumer, and they go out and find somebody  with a problem, and then they confront the person that's given them this problem, whether  it's, you know, give me my money back or give me my products you promised, or there's roaches  in your restaurant, things like that, and you do a shame on you segment.  Ask Asa.  Isn't that Asa the same thing?  Asa.  Asa.  Yeah.  They give them all different names.  Ask Asa.  These do-gooders. 
[01:31:00]  Do-gooders.  They stink.  These people are just trying to make a living.  And it's always a squad.  That's how they rip a guy off every once in a while.  It's like a squad.  They call it the squad or the patrol.  They all wear.  Something militant.  They all wear their sunglasses.  Yeah.  They're out there.  They're walking around.  Hey, you.  Right.  You know what you did to our friend here?  Shut up.  Look, lady.  You don't care.  I haven't had sex with my wife in five years.  I got five screaming kids.  I'm just trying to make a fuck out of me.  Fuck. 
[01:31:30]  Will you shut up?  And I got this asshole on me with a camera.  So I charged him an extra $100 at the garage.  Give me a break.  Yeah, please.  My wife's on my case to save enough money for a stupid trip to Disney World.  Help me out here.  So you bilk a few old people out of their life savings.  What are they going to use it for anyway?  There's four years left.  Stupid old people with their money.  This might be.  Oh, they're trying to hit the goddamn lotto with like two years left of their lives.  They take their life savings and give it to some guy that's emailing from Nigeria that they need your bank account number because you just, I'll give you $5 million. 
[01:32:00]  Wait, that's not real?  Oh, the Nigerian thing?  Yeah.  No, it is real.  I already gave out my bank account number.  And I'm expecting, I think, $5.2 million is going to be deposited in my account.  I think we have a better chance of making money off that thing than that stupid CDL stock.  Citadel stock, you son of a bitch.  They should track down anyone who's ever answered that email for real. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  And you, honest to God, shouldn't be allowed to vote if you are that stupid.  Oh, there have been people.  I read one story about some guy said his father had just given away his complete life savings.  How old?  How much?  That's, that's, oh my God.  That's one of them.  That's a new one.  I haven't seen that one.  Oh my God.  You've got to go to whackbag.com.  Is that on the photoshops?  Yeah.  All right.  You've got to go into photoshop on whackbag.com to see.  That's a schlong.  See, see, see, see the, the thumb wrestling with vagina's clit. 
[01:33:00]  That was really sick, man.  Is that really hers?  Yep.  Just blown up a little bit?  Yeah.  Oh God, is that funny.  It's hers.  It's a penis.  It's not.  It is absolutely right.  All right.  Let's go to Doug.  This might be, I don't know what this is.  Uh, Doug?  Yeah.  You're on the west side detour?  Yeah, it's awful.  Okay.  I tried to, uh, go with the group and, you know, take a left to get back on the, uh, you  know, west side highway.  Yeah.  The dude behind me started screaming and honking. 
[01:33:30]  I went straight.  And now I'm completely lost.  I'm on 193rd Street and like Nicholas or something.  I've never even heard of a street called Nicholas.  Uh-oh.  Neither have I.  Why did you allow him to beep you into going?  Because everyone's in a panic up there.  No one wants to stop at a red light.  You just want to get moving.  I know a lot of people around the country are like, oh God, listen to these guys.  I'm telling you, this is not really a bit.  People do not want to be in those neighborhoods in a detour.  Yeah.  He was going next to me, screaming at me and yelling at his arm out the window and shit.  What was he yelling for? 
[01:34:00]  What were you doing wrong?  He was yelling, for the love of God, don't stop.  Don't stop, you idiot.  Wow.  You know what you got to do?  You got to just roll your window down and ask for directions.  Yeah.  And then you'll hear the Christmas music.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, you got to be assertive when you're out there, though.  Like, if you see a bunch of guys, you go like this, hey, psst, hey, you, come here  for me.  I need help.  I'll try that.  All right.  Yeah, why don't you ask one of the locals for directions?  That's a good idea.  All right, Doug. 
[01:34:30]  All right, thanks, man.  Bye.  Hey, Holmes.  So, back to Shame on You.  So, CBS did a Shame on You piece on this jeweler.  This is really funny, actually.  A jeweler?  Yeah.  The racist jeweler.  Oh, is he the racist jeweler?  I didn't see this one.  Why are we doing all our black stuff with Drew Boogie in the studio?  Because we don't really like Drew Boogie.  You don't mind, do you, bro?  Absolutely not.  I'll join in with you in a minute.  There's a lot of black talk today.  Remember the ONA clan?  Drew's one of the biggest racists I've ever seen.  You should hear his mouth when the mics are off. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, wait.  This guy is pretty funny from Boston.  Chuck, go ahead.  Remember the movie The Omega Man with Charlton Heston?  Yeah.  That's what it's like.  People are going through here like as if...  The Omega Man.  That's what's going on.  Damn you.  Damn you.  At least he didn't pick the other Heston movie.  Hey, on another note, I just want to say, man, you guys are funny as hell.  I mean, truly funny, funny fucking guys. 
[01:35:30]  Anthony, have you ever done any, like, cartoon voices or anything?  No.  The closest I got was in my desperation as I was knocking 10, I did fire off a Ren and Stimpy audition tape.  Oh, because...  And when John Crickflusi was leaving Ren and Stimpy, and I tried to get, like, the Ren voice, but Billy West wound up doing both voices.  Greedy bastard.  You do voices sometimes.  First of all, I don't know if it's you, and secondly, it just makes me laugh, like, so fucking hard. 
[01:36:00]  It's so funny.  Thank you, sir.  Cool.  Thank you so much.  And Jimmy, man, and OP, too, man.  You guys are all just so funny, and it really makes my drive, like, effortless.  And on last note, man, I was really close to doing, because I never got your show before, because I didn't have satellite.  And then I was going to get a Sirius, because it was the Stern thing, because that's what I heard.  And then I heard you guys, and fuck Sirius, fuck Howard Stern, honest to God.  You guys rock, and I'm spreading the word. 
[01:36:30]  Thanks, man.  He probably thinks he's calling the Bob Edwards show.  I know.  Here's the deal with Howard, you know.  He had his time, and he was great.  Duh.  We'd be stupid to say he wasn't, but he's not having fun anymore.  He's just not.  This show has fun every day, and it shows with what you're hearing through the speakers.  So, that is the big difference between the two shows.  What it feels like, if you guys are, like, one of us, and, I mean, you don't come across pretentious, or, like, you look at the Stern, and it's like, who the...  Wow, we're good actors.  Hold on, hold on, please, hold on. 
[01:37:00]  Sorry, little person, what were you saying?  You get off the air, you're like, those fucking idiots, you know.  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's go play polo.  Millionaire Opie interrupted you.  Go ahead.  Hold on.  What were you saying, regular joker?  No, just, once again, man, thanks a lot.  All right, Chuck.  And please keep going, man.  Keep it up.  All right, all right.  Stop kissing.  Stop kissing your ass.  All right, let me get the brown shit off my nose.  All right, thank you.  There he goes, Chuck.  Let's go to Kooky Joe.  Kooky Joe. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Hey.  Check it out.  I just wanted to make a comment on the issue.  This Upper West Side, everyone being off the Hudson.  Yeah.  They've got nothing to worry about, man.  All these niggers, they'll get up to 1.30 in the afternoon.  Oh, my God.  Punch it out.  You know, we try to keep it light and fun and airy.  And this guy just has to plop that in our lap.  Don't you realize you can be racist without going over the top?  He ruins the whole thing.  I know.  Noon is the funnier word.  Rich, go ahead. 
[01:38:00]  It's what funnies right here.  He's a good friend of ours.  That was very mean, sir.  Mean-spirited.  Yes, sir.  I'm in that area where the teeth store is.  There's a real little candy store up there.  It sells weed and coke and everything.  There's dealers all over the world up there.  Yeah.  There's going to be a tragedy today.  You watch.  All right.  Punch it out.  I can't wait to watch the news later.  There will be a tragedy.  Something crazy will happen.  All right.  So, shame on you.  Yes.  Shame.  Here's the silly stinger they do.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Oh, God. 
[01:38:30]  I hate the song.  Wouldn't it be funny if they played that before, like, some kind of a pedophile story?  Or it was a father that murdered his daughter and the other girl, and then they went into  that story.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.  Hey, I need that clip for my instant replay.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When someone just gives us something really outrageous.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.  That is an awful song.  Isn't that just awful?  Comes on, and you just know they're going to be all full of themselves.  We showed this guy.  So, it's the racist jeweler, Anthony. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  They're on to him.  CBS is on to them, locally here in New York.  And, well, they have a black guy trying to get into this jewelry store.  A jewelry store?  Oh, is this, like, maybe the owner of a jewelry store, and he buzzes people in, I think?  Yeah.  All right.  And there's a problem?  Is there a problem?  I see no problem.  Isn't it his prerogative, who he lets in his store?  All I know is when I see the security cameras of these break-ins.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Ah, yeah.  He doesn't let black guys into the jewelry store.  All he did was just send, like, another 20,000 white customers to that store.  It makes everybody so frightened.  Like a shopping safety.  I don't like that type of attitude.  All right.  Well, here you go.  Here's the black guy trying to get into the jewelry store.  We sent two CBS2 employees, one black, one white, separately into Angel Jewelry in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.  Watch how differently they're treated. 
[01:40:00]  First, Terrence goes in wearing a hidden camera.  Hello.  How are you?  How are you?  The vestibule door leading into the store is locked, and the owner does not buzz Terrence in.  I'm helping the lady.  I need 10 minutes.  You need 10 minutes?  Yes.  So come back in 10 minutes?  10 minutes.  10, 15 minutes.  There was another salesperson behind the counter who could have helped Terrence, but didn't.  So he left and returned 15 minutes later.  A woman came from the back of the store to tell Terrence he could not come in. 
[01:40:30]  He's still busy.  I'm so sorry.  He's still busy?  Yes.  So should I come back later?  Buy a woman only because we have a customer inside.  A customer?  Where?  There was no customer we could see.  There was no customer anywhere.  No customer?  A customer?  Where?  Where?  No customer we could see.  So obviously the jewelry store doesn't want black people coming in the store.  That's pretty much it.  So when they buzz, they give them an excuse like go away, come back in 10 minutes, come back, 
[01:41:00]  and then you give them another excuse, you don't let them in.  So now they did this with Whitey?  Yeah.  And I guess they're a different result.  Yeah.  Now watch what happens just one hour later when we send in Steve, a white CBS2 photographer.  When he goes to the door of Angel Jewelry, out from the back comes the owner.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, Hayden.  He immediately unlocks the door for Steve.  No questions asked.  No talk about needing an appointment. 
[01:41:30]  What they should have done was send Steve 10 minutes later in the 15-minute window, these dummies.  I know an hour later, maybe the guy was with a customer and now he isn't.  Even though you know they're lying, you know the jewelry store's lying, but if you really  want to pin them, you send them a few minutes later.  Yeah.  You send them a few minutes later, not an hour later.  Or now that they let the guy in, now you send the black guy back.  See if they let him back in now that they've let the white guy in.  Yeah.  Shame on you, shame on you.  Shame, shame, shame.  Now, of course, the reporter has to confront the owner. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Good.  It was time for me to confront the owner.  Oh, you go!  It's time for me!  What a tool!  This guy don't take any prisoners.  Time for me.  Now it's time.  The moment you've all been waiting for when I kick a little ass.  Shut up.  The moment you stand on 170th Street and confront the guy in the Escalade whose music is too  loud.  Yeah.  Shame on him.  That little finger pointing in the window.  Then one comes back out with a pistol on it. 
[01:42:30]  A fist.  It was time for me to confront the owner of Angel Jewelry.  I brought both cameramen with me.  Pointing at Terrence, I asked the jeweler.  Why didn't you let this fellow in?  Because I went by appointment.  I was busy inside.  I pointed to Steve.  But you let him in without an appointment.  I was maybe not busy that minute, sir.  What about Terrence's second visit?  You told him to come back in 15 minutes.  And when he came back in 15 minutes, you wouldn't let him in.  So I was busy with the customer.  But again, our hidden camera pictures don't show any customer. 
[01:43:00]  Just the owner and two others behind the counter.  Still, the jeweler denied any racial discrimination.  It has nothing to do with this skin color?  No, sir.  He showed me his injured leg from a robbery in the store two years ago.  And said that's why he was being careful in screening customers.  I'm more curious, and I know I only choose the people that I've met.  But he didn't know our white photographer.  You never met him, and you let him in.  I have not even let him in.  Maybe so near she left him. 
[01:43:30]  I don't have no idea.  That's nonsense.  As you can see, it was he who unlocked the door for Steve.  Hey, you know, it's obviously in a perfect world, the guy is doing wrong.  He is basing who he lets in the store on the color of their skin.  And again, I say in a perfect world.  This guy was obviously accosted by somebody, probably a black guy if he's not letting black people in.  I'm sure if it was a Hispanic gentleman, he wouldn't let Hispanics in.  Perhaps if an Asian had injured his leg in this robbery, he would not let Asian people in. 
[01:44:00]  You just can't look at it like you've got to include everybody.  This is what bothers me.  What he's doing is definitely racist.  But why won't the news acknowledge that there is a basis to be afraid if you've had a bad experience?  It's like if a black guy is mistreated somewhere, or like black guys with the cops.  There you go.  A lot of times, look, they're wrong to badmouth cops, but there's a justification sometimes.  If you get the shit beat out of you for nothing, you get pulled over. 
[01:44:30]  There is definitely a reason to be afraid the next time you're pulled over.  How about you get pulled over?  Now, yeah, you're always getting hassled when you're pulled over.  You get pulled over by a cop for a legitimate reason.  This cop is strictly by the book, nice guy.  Yet you're treating him like an asshole because once again, ah, I'm being pulled over.  Right.  It's that same mindset that I think the store owner has.  They're not letting black people in.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Like I said, look at all the security cameras of these jewelry store robberies. 
[01:45:00]  Jesus.  What, are they hiding the white robber ones?  They've got a whole stack there hiding.  Oh, these can't get out.  Why are you robbing a jewelry store?  Stop.  That's what just annoys me about the news.  It's like they just, you really think you're breaking the, that's a big break in the story.  You should have done it 15 minutes later if you had any type of journalistic sense.  Stupid.  Drew, can we get some perspective here, please?  But he's fairly black, dude.  What is he going to know?  Drew is black.  Because I know that the news will not say anything about the black guys doing the crime because then they won't want to deal with the backlash. 
[01:45:30]  That's going to happen.  And, you know, they know they can't fix the problem.  You know, I know how to fix the problem.  Fucking, stop fucking, damn it.  Well, you're, like, you have to sometimes walk into a place and get, like, pissed off because people look at you a certain way.  Oh, this shit happens to me all the time.  In a DHL uniform.  It's yellow and red, and it says DHL on it, but they're still hiding behind their doors. 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  With the yellow van right in front of there.  Really?  And they're still hiding behind the doors going, what do you want?  What do you want?  And I'm picking stuff up from them.  And they called.  Maybe you're just a highly motivated crook.  Yeah.  With a whole costume and everything.  Well, you know, the Opie did deal with the guy with the dominoes.  Right, see?  I was scared.  I wasn't going to let him in, you know?  You get aggravated, though, right?  That's going to be aggravating.  I don't get aggravated.  No?  I laugh at it now.  Dude, and, you know, it's no big deal.  Black people are getting their jewels, obviously. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, they're wearing more jewelry than anybody.  Yeah, but they're still fucking up more than usual.  It's this disproportionate number of crimes that are taking place, and I think that's  why people act like this store owner did.  It's, like I said, if it was Asians that most of the time they were being robbed, it  was Asians, the guy wouldn't let Asians in.  I don't think it has anything to do with, you know, the color of your skin.  It has to do with this guy's experience, probably the experience of jewelry store owners that 
[01:47:00]  he knows.  And cab drivers.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Cab drivers, they're animals anyway.  Let them lose their soul.  Let them lose their soul.  They already have.  Ugh.  Yeah, but...  We have one more.  We have a tricky situation.  We have one more clip here.  This is a business owner that has decided that African American men are criminals, and  I'm not letting them in my store, and so he needs to have a mind change, a mindset change,  and maybe a hefty fine will help change that mind. 
[01:47:30]  How about a mindset change when he was accosted?  Yeah, that changed his mindset right there.  Maybe he didn't think anybody was a criminal until he was attacked and robbed, and maybe  that changed his mind.  So is he a racist because his mind was changed after a bad experience, or is he a fucking  dummy if he doesn't learn from an experience that happened to him that was bad?  If five bikers beat the dog shit out of you, and then all of a sudden some biker shows  up, and I know bikers are choice, racists, blah, blah, blah, but we all make snap judgments  on people. 
[01:48:00]  It's what you do.  And you base them usually on life experiences.  Normally, yeah.  Normally.  Unless you're, to me, a true racist, which you're basing them on things that have never  happened to you.  Right.  That's what a real racist is.  Right.  When you're basing them just on things you've heard.  You can't tag someone with a racist label if it's based on some reality that the guy  has experienced.  That's all.  You know?  What are you going to do?  I can't believe we're sitting here defending the racist jeweler from the same on your own.  No, we're not, though.  It's just a certain mindset.  It's like, yeah, goddammit, let me tell you something. 
[01:48:30]  Hey, look, Keith Robinson does not like cops.  He doesn't, and he, you know, he told the story, he fought sex up, he was arrested.  But when he told me when he was a teenager, he was looking at hookers, and actually, I  think it was Faulkner, the guy that Mumia shot, beat the shit out of him.  Wow, really?  Yeah, he got a good head thumping from the guy that Mumia eventually, you know, caught.  So from that, you know, I guess from that age on, he's always, like, had this, like,  fucking dislike, and he's very aggressive with cops.  He's kind of stupid.  He's going to get shot someday.  It just happens.  People don't, you know, and it's based on experiences, and people don't understand that. 
[01:49:00]  It's not a perfect world, and people don't have the mind control of a Vulcan.  You're not sitting there being a, you put this all out of your mind and think logically.  This is what happened.  And then to jump on the guy, they know nothing about this guy and his past experiences,  and, you know, the other woman that was saying he should have a hefty fine, and, you  know, it's got to go both ways.  It's much easier for them to just go to the store owner rather than going up to Harlem and approaching  all the knuckleheads on the corner and going, why don't you get a job?  They won't do that.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jim on Long Island. 
[01:49:30]  He's the next cop.  Jim?  Hi.  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  Listen, I just want to express one thing, what Jimmy was saying.  You've got to give the guy a chance to defend himself.  But as a highway patrolman, when I stop people for speeding, first of all, when they go by  me at Mach 10, I don't know who they are.  They're a blur until I pull them over.  But I've always had the occasion of when I would walk up to a vehicle, a nice vehicle,  whether it's a BMW or Mercedes or even a nice American car, as I walk up to the car, I still 
[01:50:00]  don't know who you are until I walk up to the car to announce that you've been stopped  for speeding.  And I always used to get, and this is the truth, fellas, you're only stopping me because I'm  a black man in the BMW.  Now, I don't know this person from Adam.  Right.  And the first thing they're going to say is, well, you know, don't you have a quota to  fulfill?  Oh, I guess you didn't get enough black men in the BMW.  And I got tired of it.  I used to try and tell these people, you're speeding.  I don't know who you are until I walk up to your vehicle.  And the same thing goes for with this guy in the store. 
[01:50:30]  He's got a point, but he's going a little too overboard.  You just really can't place that kind of thing on a person just because of their skin  color.  Well, I'm supposed to be neutral.  I'm supposed to be, you know, not judgmental of anybody that I stop.  Well, you're actually right.  And no one is saying that the store owner is right.  I'm only saying I just despise the way the news presents something like this as his fear  is completely irrational.  Right.  Right.  You can't judge a whole race of people because some scumbag robbed you. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  I just mean that the way the news presents this with this fucking self-righteous, holier-than-thou,  now we can't believe he feels this way when the guy has gotten the shit beat out of him.  Self-righteousness that they have.  Yeah.  That they, you know, oh, we're disgusted and you should be too.  And we're going to show you how awful this is.  Why doesn't the Shame on You crew just take over that jewelry store for a month and let  everyone in?  I was just going to say, how about the jewelry store owner goes, all right, look, keep your  cameras here during working hours for me.  Keep them rolling all the time and I'll let anyone in you want. 
[01:51:30]  How about that, Shame on You guy?  Can I turn this around?  What's this guy's name on the phone?  Jim.  Is that Jim?  Is he still there?  Yes.  Jim, you're a cop?  Yes, sir.  How long have you been a cop?  20 years.  20 years?  Now, was there ever any instance where, not you, but maybe your colleagues were pulling  people over before, you know, white guys like Anthony were getting Escalades with 24-inch  rims on them? 
[01:52:00]  Because, you know, usually a car like that was indicative of a person of ethnic, other  ethnic origins.  Hold on, Drew, could you just rephrase that and make the question a little longer?  I'm sorry, but, you know, I can't get my thoughts together.  Black guys in nice vehicles because they were black guys in nice vehicles.  Sorry, Ope.  Who gave him a microphone today?  Oh, I did.  Absolutely not.  Your job was to enforce the law, whether it was speeding or any kind of traffic violation.  We're supposed to be the type of people. 
[01:52:30]  We don't judge anybody.  Hey, we got this guy, Charles, on the line that is calling you a big liar there, Jim.  Charles.  Jim, you're a liar.  I've been a cop with the Georgia State Patrol now for 13 years.  Yeah, that's Georgia, though, man.  Here's the thing.  Listen to me, though.  It's actually in the literature in Georgia.  You can actually tell not only who's driving the car.  Whether it's male or female as they go past.  Even if they're going past at a high rate of speed, you can still tell who's driving.  You can almost tell how many people are in the car at that particular time. 
[01:53:00]  And listening to you guys, hey, I appreciate where you're coming from, but the problem is,  it's not so much that, yeah, you've probably been done wrong by a particular race or a particular group of people,  and that causes the problem.  The problem is, you make it seem like white people don't commit any crimes.  No one's saying that.  No, dude, no one is saying that.  Oh, we commit to crazy crimes.  I even raised the example of if you have someone who gets beat up by the cops like Keith,  like any time you have that experience, it's normal you have that weird fear.  I'm not saying it's right, but it's a normal human reaction. 
[01:53:30]  I'm not saying that.  How about this also?  Wait a minute.  How about this also?  How about, I would like to see that piece, that shame on you piece.  I want to see how the white guy was dressed.  I want to see you send a dirtbag white guy to the door that obviously looks like he's not there to purchase fucking jewelry.  I would want to think that a person who's going to a jury store would look like they're there to purchase jewelry.  I would think that a person who's going to, especially if this is a nice, expensive type of jury store,  that the person who's going in there is going to have a certain demeanor about themselves, 
[01:54:00]  regardless of what color they are.  Well, a jury store.  I think that's actually more playing to whether he's going to try to patronize this person or, you know,  he's going to refuse to open the door.  Personally, I think he has the right to refuse anybody who wants to, any color, black or white.  It's his store, if he doesn't want to let the person in.  Isn't it technically called, I'm sorry to interrupt you, isn't it technically called,  I don't, but it's called the, some of Ben might know, the pub rule.  There's a rule where you can ask customers to leave your establishment.  Exactly right.  Ben's had that pulled on him quite a few times.  We reserve the right to refuse. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, whatever, it's called the, what is the name of it?  It's a certain type of law where you can refuse service.  I'm not saying it's a right thing.  You don't have to let, if someone's intoxicated, you can say another.  What's the name of that?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  But, Nathaniel, you saw the shame on you piece.  How did the, what did the white guy look like?  How was he dressed?  How was his hair?  They were both sort of comparably dressed.  Sort of just a button down, untucked, and kind of khaki pants kind of thing.  But they kind of looked like guys that could be walking into a store to buy jewelry.  Yeah, sort of like business guys. 
[01:55:00]  Instead of a color of your skin thing and a race thing, how about a guy on a hot summer day, a white guy, on a hot summer day, wearing a heavy coat, a wool hat, looking very dirty, almost looking like a homeless guy, knocking on that door.  Do you think the jewelry store owner would let him in, or would he look at him and go, this guy doesn't look like he's here to buy jewelry.  I'm not going to let him in.  Now, is that illegal?  Is that him doing something that's racist?  The guy would be a white guy, but he's obviously somebody who's not there to buy jewelry. 
[01:55:30]  But he's saying both of these guys were dressed comparably, both looked like businessmen.  I think this is probably, it's probably a racial thing.  I mean, let's be honest.  No, no, I'm saying it is.  I'm saying it is.  But I'm just saying that this guy probably isn't just not letting in black people.  He's probably, like he's probably not letting in any black people.  But he's probably also not letting in other races of people that don't look like they're there to buy jewelry.  They look a little shady.  Hey, Anthony, I just have one question for the Georgia guy.  If you're still on the line.  I'm still here. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  You talk about how you can't tell.  Well, if I was driving through the state of Georgia with New York plates, is that kind of racial profiling?  Because I've got New York plates and we're speeding?  Absolutely, it is.  Racial profiling is also very much a part of what we do here.  All right.  We do.  We do racial profile.  We profile against all the evidence.  That's like the white kids.  That's part of what we do.  We have to.  That's like the white kids that I would stop in a black neighborhood saying, what are you doing here?  Right?  Same thing.  That's a great point.  We absolutely do that. 
[01:56:30]  Hey, Charles, that is so cool that you're still allowed to racial profile down there.  I'm moving to Georgia.  You're not allowed to do it up here anymore.  That's correct.  God damn it, that was a great point that I've never thought of with racial profiling.  When white kids are riding, suburban kids in a station wagon are riding around 145th and Edgecombe, you know what they're doing there.  And I've never once heard of white kids complaining, we were stopped in Harlem and asked what we were doing there.  And they always say, look, I know why you white kids are up here, what are you doing here?  What do you want? 
[01:57:00]  Get out of the neighborhood.  That's racial profiling.  That's a great point, man.  Interesting.  And I know it's different.  I'm sure black people deal with a lot more shit than white kids in Harlem.  It's just that you never hear about that.  So it's a good point.  Very good.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Charles from Georgia.  Thank you, sir.  And Jim from Long Island.  All right.  Thanks, Bill.  All right.  Thanks, Bill.  Charles, be cool to me if I ever go to Georgia.  Yeah, please.  Come see me at the funny.  Send me a PBA card.  Come see me at the funny.  I don't even have a date book, so I couldn't remember the name of the club.  Come see me at the funny.  The funny. 
[01:57:30]  That's a good name for a club, the funny.  Let's go to Bill in D.C.  Bill?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hello, Bill.  What's up?  Well, here's my point.  It's stereotyping in other industries that is considered legit.  Think of car insurance.  You know, I'm a white male, just turned 25, and all of a sudden my car insurance rates go down.  Did I really become a better driver because I was one year older?  Yes, statistically you did.  Statistically, right.  Statistically, you just did become a better driver.  So why are statistics based on race wrong is what you're saying. 
[01:58:00]  Exactly.  So this guy, statistically, you know, that blacks are, you know, robbing his store more than whites.  Why is he profiling?  They do it to me with car insurance.  Right.  And they also do it, I don't think they, they don't, they will, car insurance will never  say white male, black male, but they will say by the neighborhood you live in.  And let's be honest, we all know if you live in Bedford-Stuyvesant, your insurance is going  to be higher than if you live somewhere.  I mean, come on.  It was for me when I lived in Brooklyn. 
[01:58:30]  Of course.  My insurance was higher in Brooklyn than it is out on Long Island.  It's not racist.  The insurance companies are protecting themselves saying, look, this neighborhood has a higher,  you know, you're more likely to be ripped off.  So why can you profile there and not other places?  Because it's probably based on the area and the crimes that take place without looking  at race wrong.  Absolutely.  But for some reason, those areas are the ones that are the black areas or Hispanic areas.  But what I'm saying is why is it okay to look at any other type of data except for race  when it comes to statistics? 
[01:59:00]  Like why is, again, why is the left, and I know I attack the left a lot, but why are you  so refusing to admit that at times, you know, racial profiling has some kind of a merit  and everyone does it.  Yeah.  Black guys do it.  White guys do it.  Everyone, especially the Jews.  Everybody does it.  All right, we've got to step aside.  We've got Stephen Lynch here.

Open their mouth real wide and shove that in.  And you drool.  Great quantities of saliva down the shaft of his penis.  What a great blowjob technique.  Holy crap.  Grip the penis very gently with your hands.  I think it made me a little butt sack.  Then let him use the dildo.  Put it in.  Pull it out.  How'd you like getting your shitter? 
[02:01:30]  I like to lick ass.  This is great.  It's not gay if you're single.  You two homos know a lot about sucking dick.  You got it down to the science, it sounds like.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to find that clip. 
[02:02:00]  I know.  We really got to get that one back.  I could almost imitate that.  A couple tries in the production room with Martini Steve, I think I could hit it.  Really?  I think I could nail that one, Anthony, for us.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out.  Thanks for turning your friends on to the show on XM. 
[02:02:30]  That's your job out there.  We're watching this thing grow on a daily basis and it's really starting to get exciting.  When Anthony and I signed with XM, they were at, I think, just over 2 million subs.  Now the company is going to reach 4 million subs any day.  That's just nuts.  And then the competition, if you want to call them that at this point, they're announcing a wearable device.  Wearable.  That needs batteries and, I don't know, they're having problems with the power in this unit 
[02:03:00]  that when you're wearing it, you can't even listen live.  You could wear it much like a Neil Armstrong suit when he stepped out onto the moon.  Yes!  That's what it looks like.  These guys should not be putting out a press release like this ever.  One small step for man, one giant tumble backwards for satellite radio.  God almighty.  We have the MiFi out there.  I don't go anywhere without it. 
[02:03:30]  It's just an amazing, amazing thing to take satellite radio on the go.  I was biking the West Side Highway, like I was saying earlier, with the MiFi.  Were you okay?  Did any boulders hit you?  Well, I almost took that right turn.  Oh, boy.  I could have been there.  Perish the thought.  Having a picnic under that wall.  Because that's what I do every day.  It's called the Rego?  It's awful.  You know, of course we're going to sit here and trash the other company.  That's our job.  Of course.  But they make it so easy.  They just make it so easy.  Why would you announce this piece of crap thing? 
[02:04:00]  It needs batteries.  We could trash XM if we were at Sirius.  Look at them with their light, portable unit.  You'll forget it's there and crush it.  You'll wear it on your belt, and you'll think it's a little cell phone and put it to your ear and hurt yourself.  I hope they're not trashing XM today with all the thin, small products.  We make them big.  That's right.  You can see them.  Not only can you listen to it, but you can sit on it and tie your shoes.  If you're spending this much money on something, don't you want something of substance? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Something you can look at and go, this is what I bought.  Something big.  Work out while you listen.  Don't go to the gym.  Just lift this unit over your head.  They stink.  And I know the MiFi has a battery, but when you're looking at the MiFi, you don't really notice batteries.  You don't notice the battery.  No, this has a battery.  No, not A.  It requires two.  Oh, two.  Two batteries.  Not batteries you buy.  Battery units.  Right.  And what they don't tell you is it's the type of battery that goes in the front of your car. 
[02:05:00]  You got your jumper cables to listen to it.  Hold on.  I want to listen to the Brewer Show.  I told him not to go there.  He didn't listen to me.  I love Brewer.  I just couldn't think of another serious show.  I told him not to go there, but he did not listen.  Anyway, not have live listening capabilities.  Well, it's a wearable unit.  It's coming out at the end of the year.  By that time, you've got to see what the MiFi is going to look like. 
[02:05:30]  You've got to see this thing.  Implanted right in your head.  You've just got to think of a song, and it pops up.  I'm talking maybe as small or slightly smaller than the trios that are out now.  That's what the next MiFi is going to look like, I think.  How about that?  All right.  How about that?  And they've got this thing with a backpack that you can walk around with.  This thing's huge, and they're pushing it as a portable unit.  Right.  But the fact of the matter is, you have to put it in one of the docking stations and download  the music you want to listen to. 
[02:06:00]  Well, it says, but due to power constraints, this unit will not have live listening capabilities.  The beauty of this thing is, though, because you want to spend, like what I like to do before  I go out, especially when I want to listen to something I'm in a rush, let me spend four  hours downloading, because why would you want your iPod, which already has all your music  on it?  Uh-huh.  I'd rather go download for a few extra hours, put a few songs on, and have my batteries  run out quickly.  There you go.  That's convenient.  How about that?  Your two batteries.  What a piece of shit. 
[02:06:30]  What a piece of garbage.  This device.  It's like comparing, yeah, an iPod to one of those big console stereos that you used to  put in your house.  The wooden ones with the cloth speaker covers.  That's how far behind this company is.  They should quietly put this hardware out under the, you know, under darkness.  Yeah.  Just kind of put it out there.  Just, you know, just leave it in boxes, you know, in the back of the Best Buys, and they'll  find it, and they'll stock the shelves with some of these things. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  They're saying it's portable, but technically anything is portable if you have equipment  big enough to haul it.  This is garbage.  Unbelievable.  And I know it's biased.  We're XM.  They're serious.  But the bottom line is, it's a clunky, dumb unit.  How do you not have live capability at this point?  XM, they're on their, like, eighth model?  The gang at Bear Stearns is saying that hopefully they will have one in the middle of 2006.  Yeah, do we really believe that? 
[02:07:30]  That's like a year from now.  What about that dumb video thing they've been pushing for eight years now?  That's a year from now.  And you just wait to see what XM does next.  That's all I'm going to say right now.  That's all I'm going to say.  There you go.  Because I don't want to be, you know.  Well, the thing is, you could say that at any given moment with this company, because for  what they lack in support of the Opie and Anthony show, they more than make up for it in the  technology end of things.  Let me tell you.  Yeah, you could knock XM for certain things, but not technology.  They're constantly working on newer things, making these things smaller, making the batteries 
[02:08:00]  last longer, more capabilities.  Right.  And then in the future, you see these things integrated, that small chipset integrated into  other things.  Home stereo systems that are, they'll be like, remember your TV used to, the big selling point  was cable ready.  Remember that?  You used to buy a TV and it would say cable ready.  And it had all the hundreds of channels built in and the coaxial cable thing on the back.  All these home stereo units and other things are going to be XM ready. 
[02:08:30]  It's going to have the chipset in there.  And you just go out, you buy it, and hook it up.  You subscribe, and it's all ready to go.  No more buying other equipment.  Things like that.  Integrated into smaller units.  You know?  Everything you might carry around on a daily basis.  Things like that.  All right.  It's almost like serious things that they're eventually going to be able to broadcast on  one unit with XM.  So they're like, yeah, why bother with technology?  Let XM do it.  Yeah.  That's almost like how lazy they're getting thinking, yeah, XM will do it, so let's just 
[02:09:00]  do nothing.  And they think there's a point where they might catch up.  But, you know, XM is working all the time, making these things better and better.  I don't know, dude.  The Hyundai deal with XM was nice, but a little unimportant.  When you look at Martha Stewart, because that's what, all kidding aside, Martha Stewart brings  a lot of people to a radio audience.  There you go.  She's just captivating.  When I hear Martha Stewart, I think radio.  Yeah.  You know, I think how great that type of radio would probably be.  Although, I'd like to see the mullet.  It's kind of hard to listen to it when you can't actually see the mullet.  That's one of the big selling points with Martha. 
[02:09:30]  To the sound room.  No makeup.  No wardrobe.  One cappuccino and the microphone, and we were off.  Hello, I'm Martha Stewart, and I love to decorate with nature's bounty any time I can.  One area in which to have some fun is to use whimsical place cards.  And when she's not?  You know what?  I don't like this one.  You can only hear it between takes, but it seems Martha was picky about her programming  even back in 1997.  Who wrote this one?  This has to be fixed a little bit, because obviously whoever wrote this didn't follow 
[02:10:00]  my recipe.  Oh, hi.  Welcome to Ask Martha Radio.  The radio show complimented her...  Was that Pat?  I don't know.  It's just awful.  She should decorate her face with a shotgun.  Just awful.  These pellets make a fine addition to my brain.  Yeah, exactly.  My brain matter, all over this light blue wall.  God, just what a dullard.  Any of you women out there, how do you listen to this hen? 
[02:10:30]  Well, also, their half-a-billion-dollar baby, Howard.  This must be great for a company to read and to hear about.  You spend one-half of one billion dollars to bring somebody on board, and you would assume  that this would help out your cause, and maybe generate some money, maybe generate some subscriptions,  things like that.  It seems Hyundai, who is now a distributor of XM satellite radio in all of their new vehicles. 
[02:11:00]  Hyundai, welcome.  It seems they put out a survey before they made the decision to go with XM or Sirius.  And a bunch of these surveys came back with people saying, they don't want Howard Stern.  They don't want Howard Stern in their vehicle.  And that had something to do, a lot to do, it seems, with Hyundai deciding to go with XM.  So, Howard, you know, whether that's good, bad, or I think it's kind of, you know, kind of wishy-washy. 
[02:11:30]  There's also another little scary piece there in that press release.  Yeah, I know.  This is a little scary.  Is this the head guy that made the decision?  Yeah, this is...  You're probably listening to us today, but this is a little scary.  The head guy, he also liked the XM logo.  Better than...  The XM, better than Sirius' logo, because he said it fit in good with the little plate on the front of the radio to say AM, FM, XM. 
[02:12:00]  Absolutely, he's right.  It's clean, it's neat, it's tidy.  AM, FM, dog with a thing on a black eye.  What the fuck is that?  I don't know, what is this, domestic violence for animals channel?  Sure.  Yeah, there it is.  So the guys over there at Hyundai made their decision, and now they're on board with the XM. 
[02:12:30]  That is pretty funny, though.  I bet all that money because you like their helmets.  What's happening when Dwayne picked the Buccaneers?  Because you like their helmets.  Let's get Stephen Lynch in here, man.  He's been waiting out there a while.  He's drinking beers.  Are they drinking?  Of course he is.  He's some complete drunk.  Yeah.  I don't know who this guy is.  Stephen always could drink.  I remember doing those gigs down at Bar 9.  There's always a drunk fest.  Got an extra mic set up in here and everything. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How many mics are we capable of getting in here?  This is pretty much it, right?  Every day.  18 or 19, Anthony.  Lynch.  Lynch-y.  Stephen Lynch.  Opium.  Opium.

Delicious  Yes, nothing to eat today, yes  Wonderful breakfast  Cheers  You got an intro? 
[02:14:30]  Are you going to join us?  It is late  No, we're like fags now, man  We're the worst  I don't believe that  If I drank this early  We haven't had a beer since the show started  I fall asleep driving home  You know, just from waking up early  I'd be on the expressway just causing wrecks  It's not like the old days  God, I loved afternoon rides  Damn it, those were good times  The shots and beers and the heroin  Oh, it was fantastic  Remember at the end there, Lynch, it got so out of control  We hired a bartender  Were you in for that?  Those days?  No  They were bringing in mixed rum drinks 
[02:15:00]  With umbrellas and straws  There was a blender going on  We actually had a bartender that set up every Friday on the old show  Every Friday  How we talked Ken Stevens into that  Like, oh, no, Ken, it's like a bit that we're doing  But no, it had nothing to do with the show  It was not a bit  It was the fact that we wanted to drink hard liquor  At our job in the afternoon  And then the bartenders started bringing shot girls with them  We actually had shot girls  Shot girls walking around  With a test tube  And we were doing the drinks  And it's like 
[02:15:30]  Was there a velvet rope in front of the building?  You're not allowed in  You're not dressed right  Yeah  That was pretty much  We were running a bar  It was amazing  I got turned away from the doorway  Oh, did you?  Too many dudes with me  You can come and stay with these guys  Yeah, man  Those guys outside  You guys are going back to afternoons, though, right?  I wish  God, I wish  That's the rumor, but no way  They want to, you know  It's a national show now  It's one of those things where personally  It was a national show back then 
[02:16:00]  I would love doing it  But I also know it's better to do morning drive  For a national show  You know  Well, nationally  It was a national show if it was 1780  We didn't get too far  We didn't get too far west  Yeah, that's true  But we were in like Sacramento  I hope that was accurate  It was actually, yeah, it was  It's close, right?  But they would get our show at 6 o'clock  The Jamestown settlement  Yeah, exactly  They would get our show at 6 o'clock on the west coast  Oh, right 
[02:16:30]  So their drive home is done  You know, for the people that wanted to sit in their house and listen to us  That was fine  But we kind of wanted to get the commuter  So now, morning drive is the one that makes sense  It makes sense  Thanks, but  It's cool  I kind of, it's growing on me morning driving  I hate getting up, but it's like  I got to do real life things  Like with, you know, with mortgage or whatever  I get it done, actually  But it's like  Look at you  I would get up for 3 o'clock  Do you have a mortgage?  Yeah, I just started  Me too  Yeah, it's awesome  Isn't that amazing?  We should talk later about interest  I'm going today  I'm going to look at houses today

[02:22:30]  But it cuts like a knife  And I feel that I'm being misled  See I'm a little concerned  For I recently learned  Of the swastika tattoo on your head  And it makes you smile  When you hear Zig Heil  You love the smell of a burning cross in the yard  You do goose step salutes  In your Doc Martin boots  And you quoted Mein Kampf  In our fifth anniversary card 
[02:23:00]  I think you're a Nazi baby  Are you a Nazi  I think you're a Nazi maybe  You keep extensive files  On the Nuremberg trials  And you watch them whenever they're airing  I guess I should have known  When you bought a new bone  For your puppies  Named Goebbels and Goering 
[02:23:30]  And you showed up late  To our very first date  I said how are you  You said white power  Call me paranoid  But I'm not overjoyed  When you ask me  If I want to shower  I think you're a Nazi  Don't be lying baby  Tell me if you're a Nazi  Are you anti-Zion maybe  Your reverie dress is monogrammed 
[02:24:00]  You hold an annual Tom Metzger bash  And it makes me irate  When you say I look great  If I wear a little tiny mustache  Your social politics say that races don't mix  And you call it pure blood pollution  And whenever I'm sad  You say it's not so bad  For every problem there's a final solution 
[02:24:30]  I think you're a Nazi  Give me an answer baby  Or are you a Nazi  You drive a fucking Panzer baby  They say that love is blind  So how could I have guessed  But then again I met you at the Wagner Fest 
[02:25:00]  I know you're a Nazi  And that's why I'm leaving  I know you're a Nazi  Sure as my name is Stephen Lynch  Bergstein  That's a Nazi song  That's a sweet song  I like it 
[02:25:30]  That girl sounds nice  Yeah that one doesn't go over too well at the colleges  No?  No  They get all pissed off  It's like how brilliant the references are on that  What a bunch of dummies  Of course  Yeah I don't think I know who Tom Metzger is  Of course not  Goebbels and Goering  It's a nice little history lesson  And a look song all in one  At the same time  All in one  They tell you not to perform that song?  Who?  The colleges?  No no  Well I've only done it twice  Oh and you get the looks right?  Yeah  I get a lot of ooh 
[02:26:00]  Fucking little dummies  That fun little shower line  I bet they groan  Oh yeah  Oh  Oh  Oh yeah  Like they never had just legitimate showers  That's a little bit  You can't just take a shower and not get a look  Like  There you go  Come on  Very lovely  That's my new one  I like it  I like it a lot  You guys want to do another one?  I like it a lot  A lot  I just don't know if Nazis are appropriate to be making fun of 
[02:26:30]  I felt the tension from over there  Too soon  It's too soon  You kidding?  You gave him a hard on man  He was really into that one  It's a good song but I'd like to have a body count in there  Yeah, you couldn't fit six million in there?  No?  What's wrong with million?  Billion  The optimist point of view 
[02:27:00]  You could have went for the trillion  There we go  My goodness  My God, man  Alright, let's do another one from Stephen Lynch  And then we're going to get into the sex talk with the grandmas  Yeah  Hot  Another one  Alright, let me figure out something here  How about a  Well, we'll do another new one  Alright  Fuck it  I'm just trying all my new shit on you guys  Why not?  Where for?  Alright  Because when you go see like, you know 
[02:27:30]  Zeppelin or something  If you went to see Zeppelin  When they were actually playing as a band  Yeah  You wouldn't want him to do the hits  You'd want him to do like stuff you aren't familiar with  Right  I hope John Paul Jones is a 20 minute keyboard solo  Exactly  Actually, Anthony  I think you'd rather have them do the hits  Thank you for adding that  Alright 
[02:28:00]  This is a song of hope  Oh  I thought the last one was  No, this isn't a song of hope  This is kind of the antidote to the Craig Christ song  Oh  It's because I figured since I did a Jesus song  A God, you know, type song  I'd have to do  Kind of give the opposition equal time  So that's what this one's kind of about  Alright, here we go  Ever since first man has walked this earth 
[02:28:30]  I have been here  To whisper seeds of doubt  And evil thoughts into his ear  I am the beast  The outcast angel fallen from on high  I go by many names  But there is one you can't deny  My name is Satan  Hi everybody  Let me tell you a little bit about myself 
[02:29:00]  Okay, here we go  My friends all call me Old Scratch  And I am a Capricorn  My turn-ons are romantic walks  And killing the unborn  I got little devil horns and a little goatee  Little devil eyes help a little devil see  Little cloven hoops make it kind of hard to ski  I'm Satan  Uh, Mephistopheles, another name I go by  My real name is The Elzebub  But you can call me Beals  I love to watch Fox News and then go club some baby seals 
[02:29:30]  Then I'll take a bubble bath and drink a Zinfandel  Try to wash off that baby seal smell  Then I'll make a toast to me  Hey, here's to my hell  My name is Satan  To carry on my evil ways I went and had a son  And now he makes his living as a singing comedian  I'm in every Zeppelin album  I'm in all Rush Limbaugh's rants 
[02:30:00]  I'm the reason that the Boston Red Sox even had a chance  And if I want to eat your soul I'll just throw it on the griddle  Don't need to make a deal I don't need to tell a riddle  And fuck Charlie Daniels  I don't care if you can fiddle I'm Satan  The devil went down to Georgia  He was looking for a soul to steal  Which is fucking bullshit  Because I would not be caught dead in Georgia  Okay, it's like, oh my god  Thick, thick, thick  I like the new stuff 
[02:30:30]  You can tell I've been doing a lot of musical theater lately  That one was very influenced  By the great white way  The great white way  What are you working on nowadays?  Well, I just finished my tour  And I'm recording the new album this Monday  And then I'm taking the summer off to try to write some shit  And then tour again  And then I'm doing the  Well, it doesn't matter what I'm doing in the winter  Sorry, I just brought that up, actually  Really?  What are you doing in the winter?  Having a kid?  No, no, no, no, no kids 
[02:31:00]  A show?  A show, yes  A show  What show?  It hasn't been formally announced yet  Oh, really?  Sounds like somebody got a show on maybe a satellite network  No, no, no  Get out!  A stage show  A stage show, yes  Is it a revival?  It is not a revival  It is an adaptation of a hit movie  Adaptation of a hit movie  What decade movie?  Uh, 90s or 2000s 
[02:31:30]  Either late 90s or early 2000s  Schindler's List, the musical  Yes  He's essential to the war effort  I auditioned with my Nazi song  I pardon you  I pardon you  Big brown ring, round the bathtub  Big brown ring, round the bathtub  I like the little boy song  Why am I standing in shit?  Devil in a little red dress 
[02:32:00]  I like it  Let's work on it  I can't even say  Some of the ones that are in my head  They're awful  Oh, wow  You can do it  No, no  Oh, go ahead  Best leave that one alone  Oh, yeah  What do you guys want to do? 
[02:32:30]  Well, is he going to sing later or now?  A little later, I think  You want to take a little break and drink your Budweiser?  Yeah  And hang with us as we do the sex talk with the grandma?  Yeah, sure  My songs are hilarious  They're really good  Fucking great  Thank you  Thank you  Well, we got into this lady yesterday  She's on the Oxygen channel  Stephen Lynch has seen her  I've taken a peek  And she just gives awful sex advice  And it's hip and cool and different because she's a grandma  Because it's an old lady  And she's giving horrible sex advice  When Dr. Ruth did it, though, for some reason it worked  Yeah 
[02:33:00]  Because you didn't see Dr. Ruth  It was on the radio  Not only that, Dr. Ruth wasn't as graphic as this woman is  You thought Dr. Ruth was graphic  Remember when she would say penis?  And everyone would go, oh my god, it's an old lady saying penis  This one is just graphic  But Dr. Ruth also was a character because of her accent, her voice  And she had a sense of humor about herself  So everybody goofed on her  And she didn't care  She was such a little caricature  That you had to make fun of her  And this one is just your standard run-of-the-mill old lady  Yeah  Alright, we got a clip from her show  She's talking about deep-throating 
[02:33:30]  Hi, got a question  Yes, I do have a question regarding oral sex  Yeah  I'm just wanting to know how I can learn how to swallow  With not having to gag, you know  And just learn how to swallow the common stuff  Okay, okay  There's two questions there  Because one thing is gagging  And you know you have a hard palate right there  And then behind that you have a soft palate  Okay 
[02:34:00]  And then behind that you have a gag reflex  Oh, okay  Uh-huh  So  If you take that whole penis into your mouth  Uh-huh  You're going to hit that gag reflex, right?  Yeah  You're going to be barfing  This is not a pretty sight  Yeah  So just take the tip in  Okay  Drool down the shaft of the penis  That's funny  You don't want to throw up and get effort in  It's pulicare  It's not a pretty sight 
[02:34:30]  It's not a pretty sight  You're right, lady  Long job advice from an old lady  Kneel down, favor your good hip  And encourage him to cut your remaining breast  Oh, you're awful  Oh, just take the tip in  Okay  Drool down the shaft of the penis  Okay  And then just coordinate hand-mouth movement 
[02:35:00]  Okay  That'll prevent the gagging  Now  Okay  What about the taste?  Uh, what about the swallowing?  Yeah, that's okay  Oh, that's okay  Yeah, that's okay for me  It's just gagging and knowing how to, like, swallow the feeling of it, you know?  Okay  It's the feeling  The feel  Oh, it's the gagging more than it is  It's the feeling of it, yeah  Okay  Well, if you learn just to stay at the tip  Don't be Miss Piggy, okay?  You know, you don't have to do the whole thing  You don't have to do the whole thing 
[02:35:30]  No, you do  We were talking about it yesterday  Yes  Just the tip don't work  She's saying, oh, the most sensitive part is the tip  No  You need it to work  It's not an asparagus  Right  The whole thing is full of nutrients  Broccoli spear  Bad advice  Don't be Miss Piggy  Better Miss Piggy than Jim Henson  Lynch, yesterday we were talking about this  You know, these ladies got to work it like they're playing the trombone 
[02:36:00]  The trombone  They just can't be, you know  The trombone, you don't sit there and go  You go  Stay up  Up and down  Move it  76 trombones  You've got to work the entire shaft 
[02:36:30]  Make it sing  She's awful  If the tip was the only good thing, wouldn't you then, if you're having regular sex, just stick the tip in  And go  No  You drive her home  Right there  Right to the  Anthony Cumia at your cervix  You've got to bump into it  And you never hear guys bragging  How was the blowjob?  Dude, the whole head  Right in her mouth  Yeah  The whole head  Really? 
[02:37:00]  The underside of the head  Whole fucking thing  Whole in everything  She worked that frenulum  Rotten advice  That's awful  Awful old lady advice  Don't bob your head too much  Or your medical alert button will hit his ball bag  And the paramedics will show up  As he's dumping a load in your blue wig  I owe my life to it  Want to hear another clip from her stupid show? 
[02:37:30]  Sure  Like, I'm concerned  Because you have abstained  Completely  You're a young guy  You have abstained completely, totally, and utterly  For nine months  No masturbation  You're going to have a full head of steam  You're going to meet a woman  You're going to come on like  This old bag's telling me how to fuck  The guy's just laughing at the back  No sex, not even masturbation  She said masturbation 
[02:38:00]  Ask her about ass sex  She's off the phone with butt heads  And the next question  So what happened to make you stop this?  Well, I was doing movies  And I went horseback riding  Oh, my God  That woman, you're going to come on like blockbusters  You're going to bowl her over  And she's going to head for the hills 
[02:38:30]  And I wouldn't blame her  I'm going to score  I should take one look at you and go  And run  Mark  Yeah  Then I'm getting nachos  This guy is such a toy  Hey, baby  Ever been with a younger man?  Yeah, yeah  One of these days  I'm going to get me some of that pussy  She's an old slut  I love it 
[02:39:00]  He's just laughing in the background  Every time she makes a restaurant  What a creep, man  Oh, that's great  He's getting off on it  Yeah  Mark  Yeah  Why don't you masturbate?  I don't feel a need  Like, I don't really care about an orgasm  Jesus  Wow  Like, even if, say, I'm having sex with a girl  And she has an orgasm  I  And she's fine  Like, whatever 
[02:39:30]  I don't feel a need to finish  Wow  Have you ever tried it?  What?  Just having a  Like, masturbating?  Ah, yeah  Yeah  And it didn't do anything for you?  Well, like  It's an orgasm, obviously  It feels good  But  It didn't really  Doesn't  But it doesn't really do anything like that  But it would sure reduce that pressure  Possibly  Yeah  It felt good  Yeah, I think it mightn't be a bad idea  Okay  You may find, after nine months  Masturbation is gonna feel real good 
[02:40:00]  Like  All right  All right  Try it  Real good  Before you get a little burn  But if you don't  If you decide not to do it  You know, something will bring you back  Then fine  But when you get together with the partner  Oats in your mouth  That you haven't been in a relationship with a partner for over nine months  And you're aware that  Yeah, baby, let me grab those feed bags  No, I mean those actual feed bags  I think that's only fair 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  Okay  All right  Thank you  Bye, Mark  Good luck  Don't kill her  Bye, Mark  Don't worry  Okay  Bye-bye  I'll eat my ass like it's a truffle of hay  That's wonderful  Yeah, sure  Thanks  Let's see  This clip's called Get Stuffed  Get Stuffed  She pans a complex new sex toy  She tries out these new sex toys to grandma  She tries them out herself?  Yeah, and then gives her reviews 
[02:41:00]  I feel like Mr. Rogers and his tickle chest  You know  Let's see what's in the pleasure chest tonight  Well, let me tell you  You better sit down for this one  It may have sounded like a great idea  When they sat down to invent this  A combination of anal beads  And a cock ring  But I don't know how they could screw up  Something that simple  But boy, they sure did 
[02:41:30]  For starters  The cock ring is far too sloppy  And slack  I mean, that wouldn't help maintain an erection  On an elephant  And then next  We come to the anal beads  Okay  Now  They're made of soft  Squishy  Foam  Rubber  So soft  That you wouldn't even feel them  In your rectum  Well  You certainly want to feel it  If you're shoving them up your ass  She is hardcore, man 
[02:42:00]  Yeah  She doesn't like any anal beads  That you can't insert  While sitting in a little rascal  How is she testing out a cock ring?  I know  Good point  Does she know if the cock ring would work good or not?  This wouldn't work on an elephant  And I want to thank Ben Sparks for sending it in  That's not my dog  Cock ring has loops in it 
[02:42:30]  But hey  Getting them in  Now that's going to be the tricky part  It puts a whole new meaning  To get stuffed  And you know  I would be absolutely terrified  That when you were going to remove the beads  The stretchy material would break  And then 
[02:43:00]  Those balls are going to be very difficult  To retrieve  For $32  Save yourself a trip  To the emergency ward  For a proctoscopy  On our scale  Of trash  Treasure  Or try it  The silicone cock ring  With balls  Is headed straight  For the garbage chute  But hey  You know what  You could always use it  As your bolo bat  I'm getting pretty good at this, eh? 
[02:43:30]  Especially with her awful body  You pull the anal beads out  There's three feet of small intestine attached to it  Like a sock when you pull it  It's going to present a problem  Pull it harder  Correct my list  Old stroke mouth  No one is she doing  She's sucking dick  Thanks Betty Davis  For the head advice  Oh, I hope she drops  I think we have time to do another one here 
[02:44:00]  Super semen  She talks about  Super semen  Super semen  My question  It might be a myth  Is it possible  If you have semen on your  I'm sorry?  Yeah, if you have semen on your hand  If you have semen on your hand  And if you stick it up  A girl's vagina  Yeah  Is it possible that they can get pregnant?  If you have semen on your fingers?  So let's say  You were touching your penis  Okay?  Okay  That's how the semen got there  Alright?  Yeah  Some other guy  How else would it 
[02:44:30]  Some other guy's penis  Yeah  How else would it get there?  You were already ejaculated?  Yeah  If you're already ejaculated  And you have the semen on your fingers  And then you bring it up  You take the fingers  Those sperm don't care  If it's transported on your fingers  Or on your penis  They don't care  As long as it goes quickly  From your penis  To the fingers  To the vagina  Oh 
[02:45:00]  Because you see  Sperm die in about 5 minutes  Okay  Exposed to air  Heat  Any change in temperature  Soap  Water  Anything  So  I mean  If it takes more than 5 minutes  From the time you touched your penis  Until the time you're into  Heavy duty petting  Vaginal stimulation for her  More than 5 minutes  Now  Oh  Okay  Oh okay  Thank you very much  Guarantee what happened  Is he banged a girl  And she did that move 
[02:45:30]  Where she probably rubs it on herself  Yeah  And was touching herself  And was like panicking  That he got her pregnant  He was probably nervous  Well we'll get you one of those abortions  Just right  Little prick on the side of his car  Yeah  Alright  How about one more today  And then we'll get a couple more songs  Out of Stephen Lynch  I like this old bag  We were supposed to have Pepper in from COC  But he's missing  Really  That's all I know  Is Ben around?  He's missing  He's missing? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah  Here's old elephant cock now  Yeah  He uh  So the record label guys  Went to wake him up at his room  And the doorknob was  His doorknob was  Was you know  Bolted shut  They broke down the door  And there's some naked chick in the bed  But he wasn't there  So he's out on a bender somewhere  So  We'll have to reschedule with Pepper  Naked chick in the bed  Yeah they broke down the door  Jesus  Yeah  That's the real story  That's cool  That's the real story  Yeah  So Pepper will not be on the show  Because he's wandering around Manhattan right now 
[02:46:30]  Wasted  And there's a naked chick in his bed  Who was mortified as they broke the door down  Putting the water bottle  Don't hide that gift  Don't hide that gift  You know  God gave Pavarotti a voice  He shared it with the world  You have a little Pavarotti in your undershorts  All right  We still have  We still have Joe Perry coming in though  Yeah  10 minutes  15 minutes  All right  Well we got to get some more songs out of Stephen Lynch then  I'm just imagining his cock singing Pagliacci now  It could 
[02:47:00]  Wow  That's a developing story  Pepper from COC is missing  All right Anthony  Modest missionary  She suggests sex positions for shy couples  So you need to know that in the beginning of a relationship  Most females prefer the missionary position female on bottom  Okay  Because that's because they're modest  And they're shy about their body  And they don't want you looking at their body  Okay  So in the missionary position with her on the bottom and you on top 
[02:47:30]  Pretty well all you can see is her face  Right  Not much more  This old wreck  What kind of experience does she have?  A woman  She's shy  Taft's mustache used to tickle my thighs  I'm sure she's not doing backward cowgirl  Piledriver  Right  If you're going to fuck a girl in the ass  Just grab her hair  And whisper about the new deal into her ear 
[02:48:00]  Let her know you're having a good time  Say something like  23 skadooom  Invade her pussy like it's Poland in 1940  Much more  And that's okay  Once the relationship becomes well established  And once you know she's comfortable with her body 
[02:48:30]  And she's comfortable with your body  Then she starts to get a little frisky  Okay  And then positions  The one that's the most satisfying for females  Is female on top  Male on the bottom  Okay  Because females can then dictate the depth of thrusting  How far they're going to go down on their penis  Okay  So in the beginning they just stay at the top  And then as the comfort level increases  And there's more lubrication 
[02:49:00]  They go down farther and farther down on your penis  All right  Now you're lying there  You've got two free hands  Steve  I was holding a pistol  You go there, honey  You've got two free hands  One for choral stimulation  The other one for breast stimulation  You've got a winner  How much work does this whore need?  Just lay back and let her do her work  While you read the paper  And remember 
[02:49:30]  No matter how much fun you're having at the time  Don't let her know where the allies will strike next  Who flips these ships  One hand should be on the radio transmitter  Keeping in touch with your company  Who knows when you're shipping out  To kill the Huns  Bag  Goddamn relic  Sean in Jersey has something really funny  Sean, go ahead 
[02:50:00]  Hey, what a fucking double standard  I mean, if some old guy got on television  Talked about how to eat pussy  You'd be a fucking old pervert  You'd get kicked off the air  Yeah, young girls calling up  Yeah, what you've got to do is suck that cock  Take it all in your mouth  You little bitch  You've got to get deep on it  If you want him to stop hitting you  Oh, Christ  He's exactly right, though  That would be such a problem  Oh, wow 
[02:50:30]  Team girls  Because that one kid that called  That dude  He was obviously a young guy  Yeah  Imagine a young girl calling up some old codger  Yeah, well, when you lick ass  You've got to watch out  Don't tongue too much near the ball sack  You'd hear the sirens coming in the background  I'm picking them up  This is working too good  We've got to do another one here  All right  G-Spot secrets, Anthony  Hi, Andrew  I am well  Thank you for the question  Yes, I do 
[02:51:00]  I was just wondering  Me and my wife have been together  For quite some time now  Yep  And we are looking for a G-Spot vibrator  I was just wondering  How well do they actually work?  She does have the occasional dildo  And she does have a couple vibrators  But I was just wondering about the G-Spot vibrators  You know what?  They really don't work any better than your average vibrator  Honestly, they don't  Really?  Most females  Has she ever reached G-Spot orgasm?  Once  Once 
[02:51:30]  And how did that happen?  Oh, lordy  A lot of work  Oh  That was with a dildo  Ah, a lot of work  Oh  It's a dirty job  Somebody's got to do it  I don't mind doing it  Okay  Because now  G-Spot orgasm  When they are  Super, super sexual aroused  I mean, they're just  Just zinging up there  You know  Okay  Had one, two, three orgasms  She's got bed hair  And her mascara is running  And her breasts are under her armpits  And she don't care  You know  It just doesn't matter  And 
[02:52:00]  Then  Usually  It happens with  The  Venus butterfly  Okay  Venus butterfly  Oral stimulation on her clitoris  Okay  You're going to be a busy boy again  Oral stimulation on her clitoris  Manual stimulation inside the vagina  Condom or  Lots of lubrication on the fingers  Around the rectum  And just stimulate all three at once  Okay  And  She's already had one, two, or three orgasms 
[02:52:30]  Orgasms  And all of a sudden  She's just going to  Take a deep breath  And push right down  Be prepared, big guy  You're going to need a snorkel  I don't mind  You don't mind?  Don't mind  Anything please, wife  Yeah  Oh, dear me  What a martyr  Dear me  Oh, she donned, Mike  Oh  You want to make her come?  Just put two fingers in  And back over the dog  Oh  For the love of Eve  Then let her talk  While your partner 
[02:53:00]  Thinks of hanging himself  What position do you have to be in  To lick a clitoris  With two fingers in there  Tickling the G-spot  And a finger in her ass  Yeah  How do you do that?  Your fucking arms will cramp up  That's fine  Then ask the praying mantis  To stop eating your pussy  That's great  How to eat pussy  And catch flies with your feet?  I'll turn you on  To a good dildo maker  His name was Tom Edison  He had a little lab there in Jersey  And he used to pump out 
[02:53:30]  Some great machines  I had an orgasm  With one once  That said  Mary had a little lab  His face was wide as tall  Like she could give you  Any insight whatsoever  She's just awful  On anything  It's just the shock value  That there's an old bag on TV  Talking about cock  Well that's an ongoing thing  We got about 20 more of those clips  Love it  We're going to have fun with that  Over the coming weeks 
[02:54:00]  Joe Perry is going to be here  In about 10-15 minutes  Sweet  Pepper from COC  Just missing  M.I.A.  He's not in this hotel room  There's a naked chick there  They knock down the door  Knock down the door  What kind of fleabag hotel?  Don't you just go to the desk  And go  The problem upstairs  Perhaps you could call the room  Or  They won't allow that  Open the door  They don't allow you to do that  Unless there's a medical condition  Or something like that  Doesn't his road manager  Or something  Have like a  He's not answering his cell  No  He left the chick 
[02:54:30]  She bolted the door  Good hotel or no?  Yeah  One right around here  Actually one that you like  Really?  One like right over there  That one?  That one  Wow  How about that?  How about that?  How about that?  That's interesting  Naked girl in the bed  And he was missing  That is the real story  You're getting  That's the real story  The manager apologizes  We'll reschedule  I thought it was funny  We rescheduled  We just might not reschedule 
[02:55:00]  We'll have to wait and see  On that one  Okay  Lynch you want to do a couple songs?  Because I know  You're probably not going to want to do them  In front of Joe Perry  That'll be a little weird  Why wouldn't we?  I was hoping he would  You know  Solo  You think he would?  You think we'd get Joe Perry  Into the action?  That'd be cool  That'd be great  Oh that'd be so sweet  You want to play with Joe Perry  Right?  Yeah  Of course  Do we have an extra guitar?  He might just be here to talk  And have to play  You know how that goes  He'll talk  They usually just talk  He's actually very cool  We've talked to him  A bunch of times over the years  Look at Jim's got his camera already  Of course I do 
[02:55:30]  He's a rock legend  Why wouldn't I take a photo of him?  Rock guys should just  Freak people out  At radio stations  Every so often  Yeah  Like if Robert Plant  Is going around  He should just at one point  Go you know  I'm just  I'm going to sing rock and roll  Right here for you  It's like  Whoa holy shit  Get out of here  And just do something like that  They never do it though  It's like  Could you please  Just hum a couple of bars  No no  Don't want to do it  They just  That's what you're there for  We had that happen  With Kid Rock  Yeah Kid Rock  Remember we just  Had to have a guitar  Like hey look at this guitar  We just kind of like 
[02:56:00]  Awkwardly handed it to him  I remember that  But he went with it  And we had a great time  With him that day  Jammed a lot of fun  Robert Plant  We should have got him in  That would have been  A nice interview to have  Yeah that'll happen  His new CD is fantastic  And he would be on our show  In some fucking galaxy  That we don't even know about  Why not though  He's doing Q1043  And others  Why not  Yeah cause we're just like  Jim Kerr  Cause we're just like that channel  Nah but you know what I'm saying  XM platform is pretty big  Yeah  Look at Ben  It's big  It's Jim 
[02:56:30]  He knows so much  Jimmy did he did a performance  For our sound  But he's  It would not be on this program  That's the point I'm making  He would not be on this program  You can't be bothered  I think you guys are wrong  Jim we got the Stones  Coming next week too  We just put that one  We have an awful image  To these people  Did we even try to get  Robert Plant  That's a good point  Of course it is  Alright  Isn't that great  Tell him you'll talk about  Gnomes and wizards and fairies  Yeah  Maybe he'll show up  Nice  We have Steven here  And we're talking about  How we never get good guests  It's like Steven sitting right here  Like oh we can't get

[03:02:00]  And uh  She goes through  Different phases  Sometimes she's like  Alright well  It's your loss  I'm done with you  And then it's  Please why  You let me  Why crying  So she's a complete psychopath  We love these  Sweet  So we're gonna play another one  Something's going on with Norton  I'm a little distracted  He was having a conversation with Ben  I think he's trying to set up  His uh  Celebrity photo opportunity  Is that what's happening  That's exactly what he's doing  Him and his celebrity pictures  Dude when it comes  Can he just sit next to him  And have ran 
[03:02:30]  Random shots taken in the studio  We've watched Norton  Lead the show on many occasions  He'll just get up and leave  When he sees a celebrity  He doesn't say he's going  He doesn't  He just leaves  George Foreman came in  To do something for XM Kids  He was in the middle of a sentence  In the studio over there  And we're right in the middle of a break  He goes  George Foreman  Gets up  Walks out  Leads the studio  Okay  Jimmy  Show  Going on  At this point  He forgot about the show  I'm telling you  Because he just gets tunnel vision  About his celebrity photos  He's out there discussing  He's trying to set up  Did he put them on his website  When he comes in 
[03:03:00]  I think what he's doing is  And then he gets paranoid  That A and I are going to piss him off  And then he won't get his photo op  So I bet you what's happening now  Yeah  He wants to be the first one  To see him come through the door  And get the photograph  Right away  His camera's out  It's in his hand  Now he's got to explain  To whoever's taking the picture  How the camera works  He's got to test it  Get Norton in here  What are you doing?  Look at you  You're looking to see his camera  No no no  It's not about that  Oh sure it isn't  No I'll tell you  Yeah  I was off mic they said  But now I'm on  Sorry  Alright

[03:13:00]  Wow looks just like him  How you doing man  What's up Joe  Sorry I'm late for the meeting  It is kind of like a meeting in here  It is  This is really not a radio show anymore  Nobody has to qualify right  We like a crowded studio  For some reason  How you guys doing  Always ended up that way  What's up Joe  Good  Yeah  I'll give you the players  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, Stephen Lynch  And Rod  What's up  Rod  And Rod  We don't even know what Rod does  But he's here  Just hanging out drinking beers  They started at like 
[03:13:30]  What  Eight in the morning  What are you doing in New York  A little of everything  Yeah  A little promo stuff  Everything  We've been going for two weeks now  Ever since  We played Harpers Ferry in Boston  You know  That kind of started things off  And we haven't stopped since  Really  But today's the last day  So you guys are getting  The benefit of me  Doing 2,000 interviews  I was going to say  We're getting the  We have the shot  Oh I just want to go home  Joe Perry  Actually 
[03:14:00]  I think we're going to  I think we may stay an extra day  To see  To go to Saturday Night Live though  Oh that's cool  Oh yeah  Topping it off  Because Will Farrell's there  And Queens of the Stone Age  You're playing  It's a great show  Are you going to be playing maybe  Give us an exclusive  When  Where  Here  SNL  No  I don't think so  You never know though  With those guys over there  No you don't  I mean we may  You know  If you're there  Sometimes they drag you in  But you know  We're really just  Thinking about going to watch the show  Yeah  One of the best days  Anthony and I ever had  We had all you guys in 
[03:14:30]  When we were doing our Boston show  Oh yeah  We had the whole band in  That was like  One of the highlights of our career  Yeah before Menino threw us out of Massachusetts  Then we had a little problem  And then we had to leave  Oh wow  Never return again  We've been told that a couple of times though  Well how is that  Like did you guys have to like move  Like your families and stuff too  I mean  Well thank God  Back in the neighborhood  We had no families or anything  We were pretty much it  Yeah  We were our own family  And yeah we had to leave though  We had to like get out of town 
[03:15:00]  And move back to New York  And yeah we were just kind of getting used to the whole thing  I think Opie adapted to Boston better than I did  Yeah  I was kind of like always a fish out of water up there  You know  I don't know how you feel  Do you like New York or  I love New York  Yeah  Oh we love it here  It's  Some people from Boston come down to New York  Not too adaptable  You know what I mean  No we love it here  Ever since we first came here  You know  What about a century ago  To get our first record deal  You know 
[03:15:30]  I've always loved it here  The energy is incredible  And I love every chance we get to come down  It just seems like we're always working  So I don't get a chance to get out much  But I guess that keeps it tantalizing you know  Yeah you guys man  You really are a very hard working band  You're out all the time  When you guys  You obviously went through your peaks and valleys  As far as especially band popularity went  You had that dry spell  And then the whole resurgence in the 80s  Did you think well into  You know  Halfway through the 2000s here 
[03:16:00]  That you'd still be riding that wave  No  No you know  I think we were lucky enough  To still have hair like in the 80s  You know  I think that  The fact that we  You know  We made it when we were young enough  In the 70s  And managed to stay alive  Through that period  When a lot of people didn't  Unfortunately  And be able to come back  When you know  MTV started  And we were just still  You know  Had enough  We could come in on that kind of 
[03:16:30]  That vibe you know  And do some good videos  And the whole thing  We managed to sneak in there  And for a lot of people  Permanent Vacation is our first record  You know  Yeah  So we you know  Basically had a second chance  And that kind of carried us through  And you know  Of course we've always had our fans  You know  From Boston in the 70s  And all you know  And Detroit and stuff  And  But do you find some of those people  Because I know  Some of those people would say  And it's a hard thing  When you're a band  That had popularity years ago  And then of course  You have this resurgence  That's sustained  And you become 
[03:17:00]  Very commercially viable  A lot of people  Use the sell out  They're not the same  They're not fuggers  You know  So many different  You get so many different people  And so many different angles  You just can't keep up anymore  Because you get  You get the guitar kids  That love the metal  And love the guitar plan  All the way to the  To the jocks  That loved Angels  You know what I mean  You get such a spread  I can't figure it out anymore  That's a great way  That's a great way to look at it  I'm just glad  Everybody likes the music  When they do  You know what I mean  That's what happens  To some of the hardcore guys though 
[03:17:30]  They see like a soccer mom  A fan of the song  From Armageddon  And they go crazy  Like these guys are sell outs  Yeah I mean  I get  I see some of the emails  You know  Some guys whining  Because Aerosmith  Hasn't had guitars  For the last 20 years  You know what I mean  But you know  Then we come up with a record  Like Honking on Bobo  You know  Just to prove that  With you know  Still doing that  That was a great record by the way  I had that one in my iPod  Do you take it  Do you take those things  Into consideration  And kind of  Adjust what you do  Based on something 
[03:18:00]  Well you guys must do  The same thing  I mean  You've got fans talking to you  Fuck our fans  Fuck our fans  They're assholes  And they all love it  And they come back  And they tell you  We love your show  Or you don't  Or you said this  And it all registers  You know what I mean  Whether it's like one fan  You like to think it doesn't sometimes  You know sometimes  You read message boards  And other things  That's kind of what the internet  Is kind of ruin things like that  Because you do read them  And you like saying  I don't pay much attention to them  And then that one  Just pokes you sometimes  You're like  You son of a bitch  Exactly  And you remember it  You know what I mean  It hangs with you 
[03:18:30]  And sometimes it's just  That one person  And sometimes it's  You know  Or you think about the  You know  You look at your ratings  And you go  We're doing this good  We're not doing that good  You know  And it's the same thing  We go to the shows  And we  You know  In the live venue  Where it really counts  And the fans get off on it  And have a good time  And that's really where it matters  And then  You know  There's always the one or two people  Like you said  That come on the  On the board there  And you know  And say  How could you do that  How could you play that solo there  And you know  And it's like  Okay  Another person heard from  You know  There you go 
[03:19:00]  Chalk it up  But you don't adjust  What you do  Based on  Well a little bit  I mean  I think probably the biggest thing  Is when we  Do the set list up  You know what I mean  Really  And like  A fan will say something  A meet and greet  Or something like that  And have a request  For some song  That maybe we've rehearsed  And we can actually  Put it in the set  So that's pretty much  That's probably a hard part  Of having such a huge repertoire  Like you guys have  Over the years  Is you can't include  Everything  And on any live show  Well we usually rehearse  About 40 songs  You know  At the start of a tour  And then we end up 
[03:19:30]  Playing about 25 of those  Over the course of the tour  That's pretty cool  That's a lot of songs  To have available  We don't practice  Stream on though  No  You know  We wait till we get  On the stage  And do that one  And just let it fly  Yeah  That is cool  Big Sox fan  You know  I'm really happy to see  You know  The whole  Thing that's been happening  In Boston  And it's doing great  But no  I don't really  Follow sports much  You know  Thank God  One guy  One guy from Boston  That's not talking about  The Pats  And the Sox  I mean I love 
[03:20:00]  Watching it  And seeing them win  And the whole thing  And the Pats  Of course  You know  What they're doing  I went to a bunch  Of the games  And you know  I love it  I love the energy  Around it  But I'm really not  You know  I don't really  Follow it very much  Anyone else in the band  That just annoyed you  With their Sox talk  Or most of these guys  No  Nobody's like  A real  You know  I think Steven  Might be a little bit  More into it  You know  Yeah  I don't know  They just don't like sports  You guys  Obviously  It appears 
[03:20:30]  You're enjoying  The hell out of yourselves  When you're playing us there  Yeah  I mean  Are there other  You know  Because I know  Any band has issues  Or problems  Especially even earlier on  You know  Feeling each other out  And then midway through  Maybe with drug problems  Things like that  But then just keeping it together  Because did you see  The Metallica movie  I heard about it  Yeah  I mean I have seen the movie  In a metaphorical sense  Yeah  I'm sure  I'm sure  But  So that's  Spinal Tap  Any other movie  That does  Spinal Tap says it all  We were just talking about that  The other day  We love that movie 
[03:21:00]  I mean  The kids watch it  We all sit around  And love it  Because it's  I mean it's us  You know  Everything that goes on  In that movie  Has happened  I mean everything  From the  You know  The bad album covers  Done by  You know  Makeup  Makeup girls  Girlfriends  I mean everything  You name it  We've done it  And it's  I love that movie  Did you find  There's things that you guys  As a band  Have to deal with now  That maybe you didn't earlier  Or any  Or you're just happy  To be there  Well you know  Some of the bumps 
[03:21:30]  Are still there  I mean obviously  I mean we're still  The same people  We were when we were 18  I mean you don't  You don't change much  As far as  You know  Likes and dislikes  It's how you deal with it  And a lot of the stuff  We don't take home anymore  You know  We kind of went through that  That whole thing  Like Metallica did  You know  Jesus 15 years ago  And sorted a lot of that stuff out  And you know  We still have our  Attitudes  And like I said  Ups and downs  But we just don't take it home  You don't need a band therapist  Not anymore  That was the craziest thing  We all could be licensed 
[03:22:00]  I'm sure  Yeah  To see a therapist  Involved with Metallica  Was the strangest thing  Yeah  As far as that  I was a little surprised  I figured they would have  You know  Because of everything  They've been through  Up to that point  I figured that  I was a little surprised  To see that they went through that  But you know  I guess everybody has to do  Whatever they have to do  In their time  You know  Sometimes it's hard  To get so many creative people  In one spot  For so long also  And have them work together  Without blowing up  At each other  And I think  The longer you're in it  The more you see it 
[03:22:30]  As kind of a business  And instead of just pure art  That happens to make money  Oh definitely  Man as soon as you start  Trading your art for money  You're you know  It's a set up for  For catastrophe  So  Yeah  And you know  And you learn how to  Balance it out  You know what I mean  Everything from like  What songs you pick to play  To just everything  So  And I think that  Rock and roll in itself  Is just  It's all about  Getting out on stage  And playing louder  Than the next guy  I mean that's  It was all about  Rebellion in the 60s  You know  The whole thing 
[03:23:00]  So  Naturally  If you get five guys  That want to be louder  Than anybody else  You're going to  It's going to carry over  Into your band  I mean  I don't know of any band  That doesn't have  Ups and downs  And you know  Those kind of things  And they just sort it out  Or they don't  When do you guys think  You'll call it quits  I don't know  Like is there  Something in your mind  Where you know  When it's not fun anymore  Or  Probably that  You know  I think that  I ask that  Because we went to  The Rolling Stones  Press conference  Two days ago  Yeah  And they look like  They're still having  A good time doing it 
[03:23:30]  That's it  I think as long as  We're having fun  And the fans are having  Fun hearing it  That's when we'll  We'll keep doing it  I think that once  People start getting bored  And start phoning it in  We're going to hang it up  Dude one of the biggest  Things you guys did  I thought  Was when you and  Run DMC  Did Walk This Way  It was just mammoth  And it like fused  Two like forms of music  Which you really did not  See being done  Like how did that come  Whose idea was that  Was that you guys  Or was that them  That was actually  Rick Rubin  The producer  You know  And it was  I mean I was  You know just hearing  This rap thing going on 
[03:24:00]  And you know  One of my kids  Was playing it  Booming out of his bedroom  And I thought  It was really cool  To me it sounded like  Do you know what  Rap song it was  That you were playing  It was one of the  One of the Run DMC songs  Oh okay  Rock box  And it was off that  Record  Because it sounds so  Normal today  But back then  To take rock and rap  What  What kind of drugs  Are you on  That you caught up  With this idea  Rap was just starting  I mean it was just  This new kind of thing  And to me it sounded  Like blues  Just a natural extension  Of the blues  Because it was all about  Like the street corner  And reality 
[03:24:30]  And real basic  You know anybody can do it  Kind of thing  You know I mean blues  Is the same thing  I mean it's just  It's a basic element  This guy just beating  On the guitar  And just you know  Spilling his guts  And that's kind of  What rap is  And so I mean  Obviously we've seen  It morph into  All kinds of things  But you know  That was a big crossover  Though right there  That was like a  Milestone  And a huge risk  Obviously  Because you know  It could have been  Just an awful  Awful version  Well  But I mean it wasn't  You know 
[03:25:00]  It's fine  Yeah  But I mean  That was all  It was just one of those  Things you know  But did you think of the risk  Factor at the time  Or not really  Not at all  Right  No it just seemed  It seemed like a natural  Thing to me  It seemed like  Like I said  To my ears  It felt like a natural  Extension of the blues  So when they asked us  To come in and do it  It just felt like  Why not  Let's try it out  You know  And we really didn't know  What it was going to come out like  And we walked in the studio  It was a studio  Down here  I guess  I think it was in  In the Bronx  And they actually 
[03:25:30]  They didn't know  What they were going to do  I mean they didn't have  Any of the lyrics written out  I mean the story's been told  But you know  They kind of sat  In the room  In the corner with Steve  And jotted down  What they thought it was  And he said  Oh that's fine  And we didn't know  What the music was going to be  All they wanted  Was really the drum beat  You know  And the guitar riff  And that was it  But we felt like  After it went by  That it needed some bass  And I said  Well  Anybody got a bass 
[03:26:00]  And there were these kids  Hanging around  In the studio with us  And it was the Beastie Boys  And one of them said  I got a bass at my apartment  I'll go get it  So we went around the corner  And got it  And came back  And put the bass down  And that was it  We really didn't know  What it was going to be  And I know that  Even talking to Rick  They weren't even sure  They were going to put  On the record  At one point  And it was kind of like  The last thing they were doing  For the record  So it ended up  And the video was really  The thing that really  Got everybody  Because again  We didn't really know 
[03:26:30]  What that was going to be  That wall was a little flimsy  Though  Well now with CG  It could have been done better  We could always go back  And redo it  People have never seen  Those two things together  And it was just like  When you're looking out  On the surface  You're like  This is never going to  Fucking work  You guys can run DMC  And it was just  It was phenomenal  I still love  Cranking out that song  We got surprisingly  Few letters about it  You know what I mean  There were a few people  That were  How could you do that  Kind of thing  And you know  I don't know  The rock rap separation 
[03:27:00]  Was pretty huge  But man  It worked  And especially in Europe  We were surprised  We went back there  And it was  A lot of  It was the first time  A lot of people  Had heard of us there  And it was great for us here  And it was great for music  All around  So I just thank Rick  For having that  Bolt of lightning  Do you think that  That helped open the door  For Ozzy singing  Stayin' alive  I would have to say  The band's always  Giving you the latitude  To do your solo stuff 
[03:27:30]  Yeah  That has to help  As far as  I think the longevity  Of the band also  Giving you the ability  To go out and do your own thing  Yeah  Well you know  Since the band  Got back together  I have a lot of respect  For the miracle  Of what we have  You know  Again  Look at the Metallica thing  You see what people  Go through  And I've always been able  To put a song or two  On an Aerosmith record  And it's always  It's been enough  But this time  I think that  I had so much stuff  Just kind of piling up  In the closet 
[03:28:00]  I really felt like  I had to get rid of it  Because  You know  Every time you walk  Into the room  To write  If you've got all these songs  You really believe in  And they're not getting used  It's  Not that it was all that  But there was  A couple of riffs  And a few songs  That  Also  Some of them  That you hear  On my new solo record  I just don't hear them  On an Aerosmith record  Really?  There's a couple of things  On there  That  They're really personal to me 
[03:28:30]  And I just  You know  That's why I call it  A solo record  You do Crystal Ship  By The Doors  On the new CD  Yeah  I gave that a try  That's pretty cool  Thanks  Isn't it amazing  That you could be  In such a successful band  And still enjoy  Doing a cover tune or two  Every so often  Well you know  It's  There's so many things  So many cover songs  You want to do  I mean  For every song on there  I've got like  Five that I haven't  Put out  And the band covers stuff  When we rehearse  We like to  Do that  There's so many great songs 
[03:29:00]  It's almost like  Again  That's why we did  The Honking on Bobo record  There's so many cool tunes  You know  And you just want to  Throw down  So it's  It is  It's a lot of fun  To do that  When you say  You can't picture  Some of these songs  Aerosmith doing it  Is it like an issue  Where you would go  Into the studio  And you couldn't  Picture yourself  Really  Saying to these guys  I want it like this  This is how I want it played  This is how I want this played  It's you know  We're kind of past that  It's almost like  I have so much 
[03:29:30]  You know  Feeling of ownership  For some of these  These lyrics  It's kind of like  I want to be the one  To interpret them  You know what I mean  If Stephen came up to me  And said  I still want to do  You know  Take a shot  At  Hold on me  I would say  No problem  You know  Yeah  Because I've already done it  And I've already put it out  You know  And people have heard it  You know  The way I want it heard  So  I have no problem with that  And if they did come up to me  And say  You want to play one of these live  That would be great  But I'm certainly not going to 
[03:30:00]  Say  We've got to play this stuff  Next tour  You know  Are you touring by yourself  With this album?  Actually  I just did a couple of shows  I did a show at Webster Hall  And a show at  Harper's Ferry  In Alston  In Boston  And I think that's going to be it  We were talking about  Going to the West Coast  But I don't know if  The way that  The dates are lining up  If it's really going to happen  You ever have a song  That you like  Like  I know in a band  It's got to be tough  Because there's four or five guys  Working on one concept  Where you were overridden 
[03:30:30]  Like where they did  What they wanted to  And like you'll still hear it today  And go  Motherfucker  I know that that's not the way  That should have been  Ah the compromise  You work through that stuff  I mean that's what a band is  In the end  It always seems to work out  For the greater good  There are certainly things  I look back at now  That I'm amazed  That we've let go  You know  All of us even  You know  But sometimes there's stuff  That I'll sit back  And I go  I should have  I should have  Put my foot down more about  And I'm sure that the other guys  Feel the same way  But that's what a band is 
[03:31:00]  And like I said  In the end  The strength of all the guys  Together working it  Is really what it's about  Yeah  You know  I mean when you hear  The Stones play  You know  You hear 40 years  Of playing there  You know what I mean  There's nothing like it  When they lock up  You know  All right  Well the phones have  Exploded here  Let's say hi to  Artie in Philly  Artie what's up  Argie  Argie what's up  What's going on guys  Joe huge fan of Aerosmith  Question for you  How come you guys  Never play Angel 
[03:31:30]  And I've seen you guys  Like 10 times  It's one of my favorite songs  I look at all those  Set lists in the city  And you never play Angel  Yep  You're right  Well you know what  And we know that  We know the fans like it  And a lot of fans love it  And we request it  And for some reason  It always slips through the cracks  But you know what  Maybe this tour will do it  John take a note  But thanks for the vote  You know  That song was kind of a hit  You know  Kind of  You know 
[03:32:00]  How could it just  Slip the mind of the band  You know  Well there's  Crazy Crying Amazing  You know  There's like  It must be nice  To just go  Oh yeah that Angel song  You know  There are certain songs  That fit in certain slots  You know  And some of the ballads  It's almost like  You have to make a decision  Between the  Between like an Angel  Or a Dream On  Or that kind of thing  And I know that  Steven really loves  We all love doing Dream On  The fans love that  So  But I know Angel's one  That should be on the list 
[03:32:30]  More often than it is  Alright let's go to North Carolina  Eric what's up  Hey man  Hey Joe  How you doing  I'm good  How are you  Alright great  I got two quick questions  Sure  First one is  How do you get that  Incredible plucky  Twangy tone  Like on the  Janie's Got a Gun solo  What is that guitar  That you do that with  That's actually a  I don't know if you're  Obviously you're a guitar player  Yeah  I use a guitar  With a PZ electric pickup in it  You know  One of those ones 
[03:33:00]  That kind of sounds  Like an acoustic guitar  But you can plug it in  Is it like a Parker Fly guitar  Actually  No  Back  This was a  It's a Gibson  Chet Atkins model  Thing  It looks like an acoustic guitar  But it's actually kind of skinny  But it's  You can get the same effect  With a  With a Parker Fly  Because they have that  Kind of PZO pickup  And I used a little  Marshall  Practice amp  One of those  15 watt transistor  Cheapo  Turned all the way up to 10  That's just the coolest tone  And I love that  Thanks a lot  The other question is 
[03:33:30]  How cool is it to be like  Best friends with Jimmy Page  And is Jimmy Page  Like a really cool guy  Or what  He is  A really cool guy  It's an amazing thing  To be  No he's an asshole  To sit in the room  Because I  I mean  It's kind of funny  Because I've known him  For years now  I've been fortunate enough  To run into him  And we've  Hung out  And I've been down  To his house  And we sit around  And we talk about  The kids and family  And all that  And there are a lot of  Like Led Zeppelin questions  That I've never asked him  And I'm always 
[03:34:00]  Thinking about this  Like later on  Just like all that stuff  Because it's more like  Day to day  Like how do you like your curry  Whatever you know  And I did an interview  With him last year  For Guitar Player  And we were actually  Able to talk about  Guitar stuff  And it was really cool  To sit there  And ask him stuff  You know  Questions like  How did you get that  Sound  And he said  I don't really remember  You know  There was a lot of that  Did you go to  Aleister Crowley's house  Did he still have that  I think he still has it  You know  We didn't go there though 
[03:34:30]  You ever get  Starstruck ever  I mean  Because to me  I can't even imagine  Hanging out with  Well you  Or like  You  I mean  Let's start with you  But I mean  You know  Jimmy Page  It's like  What  You just get to hang  With Jimmy Page  That's got to be  Just like kind of  Trippy at times  Well you know  It's one of those things  You kind of pinch yourself  Because everybody's  Just you know  They're all  We're all people  You know what I mean  And you get in the room  Everybody's got the same  But there wasn't one person  Where you met them  And went  Oh wow  That's like  De Niro  Or that's  Whoever  Well one time 
[03:35:00]  I was in Hawaii  And  Greg Brady right  No  And the governor  Was there  With his family  And he likes to smoke cigars  And I like to smoke cigars  And we went down  And it was about  Eight o'clock at night  And he got in the hot tub  And he's a really nice guy  I mean  He'll just  He'll talk to anybody  And you know  I knew him from doing the  From Walk This Way  Being in one of the movies  So you know  I kind of  Wanted to talk to him  I'm a big fan  And you know  And so I'm sitting there 
[03:35:30]  Talking to him  And I'm in the hot tub  We're there  And I had this huge  Huge Cuban  And I hadn't been  Smoking many cigars  And I don't know  If you know  But you know  But when you smoke  One of those huge Cubans  Man  There's so much nicotine  It just  You get pretty messed up  You're dosed man  And so I smoked  The whole thing down  To this  To a stub  And then when I got up  I almost threw up  You know  Because I was like  So into like  Talking to him  I didn't realize  How much I was smoking  Anyway  Big A.R. Smith fan  Arnold  He was  You know  He knows the band 
[03:36:00]  Yeah  It's kind of cool  To know that he knows  About A.R. Smith  We've got to back time  At the end of the show  Because we want to end  With Joe Perry's  Latest song here  Someone figure that out  Travis from Oklahoma City  Hey guys  What's going on  It's Bunky  Hi Travis  What's happening  Joe Perry  I've got to tell you man  You have been  Such an influence  On my life  I've been to almost  30 of your shows  29  Wow  Yeah  I went to  Seven of the Nine lives  Tour  And  I didn't get to see 
[03:36:30]  Honking on Bobo  But I did get the DVD  I've got to tell you man  Thanks for sticking it out  I know you guys have been  Through a lot of shit  And had some pretty bad  Managers  And some pretty rough times  But I've got to tell you  Thanks very much  For sticking it out  Because you guys  Have no idea  How much I mean  To your band  Well thanks  You know  It's early in the day  But that's about  The best thing  I could have heard today  Oh cool  Thanks a lot  Alright  What's the latest  On the band  Like new record  Touring  We have a live record  That's coming out  Sometime this fall  It's actually taken  From one show 
[03:37:00]  So it's kind of  Kind of cool  It's got a couple  Of deep cuts on it  And  That's one great thing  About you guys  Is the live show  Sounds unbelievable  When you go see a band  Live  You want it to sound good  And you guys  Have never disappointed  I've been through  Quite a few Aerosmith shows  And who's the  Who's the guy  Doing those high vocals  Over  The guy  He plays keyboards  Yeah  Russ Irwin helps out  He's been on the road  With us for  I don't know  Jesus  Eight years now  You know 
[03:37:30]  We've had other people  Back there  Playing the things  And he trades off  With Steven  Sometimes  Because I hear  Sometimes him going  On top of Steven's  Vocal for a high harmony  It's like  Holy shit  This guy should  Have some recognition  Well you know  We throw a light  On him once in a while  He's on the record  And he's  You know  He and Steven  They trade off  Do you ever grumble  Like god damn it  I'm doing  Nah  He gets paid plenty  Is that it  Good  I'm up with some cash  Do I have time for one question  No  Well go ahead real fast  We're running out of show  And I want to get the song on  You guys have fucking monster balls 
[03:38:00]  You went after Metallica  In 94  At Woodstock  And you're on tour with Kiss  And you're following Kiss every night  Is there anybody you are fucking afraid  To go on after  No  Not at all  No  No  Alright  No you decide early on  That that's not even an issue  Yeah  We have a couple more minutes  Alright cool  We got one more question  I want to get to here  Corey from New Jersey  What's up  Yeah Joe  What's up  I heard that you go deer hunting  With Ted Nugent  I wonder what that's like  It's great  He's an amazing guy  He is really talented 
[03:38:30]  Man  I mean not only does he rock  And play great guitar  And everything  But when he's in the woods  He's really in his element  It's an amazing thing  To be out there with him  I can imagine that's probably the one time  He's quiet  Yeah you're right  You got that right  You have to be quiet  You got that right  We've had him on the show many times  And people don't even know  That Anthony and I are here  They think we took the day off  Yeah  So that's a good one  Head goes off  Hey a barbecue enthusiast  What's that about  You got your own barbecue sauce now  Yeah well I've had it for a couple years  It's well  It's going on two years 
[03:39:00]  And we actually have two  Two different sauces out  And there'll be a couple more coming out  That's got to be brave  To try to come up with a barbecue sauce  Well you know  I know what I like  I like barbecue  You know  It kind of fits with the blues thing  You know  It all seems to make sense to me  And it's what I like  It's on my table  And it's the kind of thing  I wanted to be able to hand out to people  And friends and stuff  Because I just love hot sauce  So we managed to put this thing together 
[03:39:30]  And it's doing pretty well  Yeah it's definitely doing well  Where do you get that?  Yeah where do you get that?  Well there's a couple of stop and shops  That have it up in the Boston area  There's a  You just pop in with it and go  Hey could you stop the shelves at this year?

You got a jockey for shelf space  All that stuff  But we are at the hard rocks all around the world now  All right  So like Peter Townsend trying to get salad dressing in  As you're going in there
