<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with fill-in hosts Sam Roberts and E-Rock interviewing director Robert Rodriguez about his film *Grindhouse*.  They discussed the film's reception, its unique structure, and its exploitation-film aesthetic. Rodriguez shared anecdotes about his filmmaking process, including using a wheelchair as a camera dolly and his early career struggles, which included using money from medical experiments to fund *El Mariachi*.

The show then transitioned to a segment where Opie (though absent from the broadcast) recounted receiving a bicycle ticket from an Environmental Control Board employee he referred to as a "golf cart cop,"  detailing the encounter and expressing frustration at what he saw as an abuse of authority. This segued into a discussion about the abuse of power by those with limited authority and their interactions with the public, sparked by a prior chance meeting with comedian Stephen Lynch.  A listener call from Georgia then steered the conversation towards the dangers of organized children's sports, the pressure on young athletes, and Opie’s negative gym class experiences. This led to a humorous, and at times offensive, tangent about stereotypical lesbian gym teachers.

Following this, Opie and Anthony themselves took over the show, reminiscing about their own experiences with female gym teachers and locker room voyeurism, incorporating caller stories about inappropriate observations of naked girls in school.  The conversation broadened to include mandatory physical examinations, including hernia checks and scoliosis screenings, highlighting the potential for discomfort and abuse. Guest Bob Kelly then joined the broadcast, sharing his own account of childhood abuse at the hands of his stepfather. This prompted further caller stories detailing their unsuccessful runaway attempts as children, some humorous, others highlighting serious issues of abuse.  The segment ended with a heated exchange between the hosts and a caller.

A subsequent segment featured more caller anecdotes about their childhood runaway attempts, ranging from humorous failures to more serious instances.  This was followed by an in-studio interview with actor Kurt Russell, promoting *Grindhouse*.  They discussed his career, working with Quentin Tarantino, movie premieres, and the differences between modern and classic trailers.

The show then delved into a sexually explicit trivia game using a board game and cards provided by sex therapist Laura Korn, filled with vulgar language and descriptions of sexual acts. A hostile exchange with a caller, a painter working on Anthony's house, punctuated this segment.

Another segment focused on a sexually explicit trivia game involving Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, covering sexual preferences, practices, and pop culture.  This included reading suggestive instructions from the book "Men Love Bad Girls,"  discussion of survey results, and graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  Roland, the show's talent booker, contributed a Steve-O impression and recounted his awkward experiences as an intern for Carson Daly, including audio clips of his interviews. His movie review style was also analyzed, interspersed with more sexually explicit trivia and discussions.

The broadcast concluded with a retrospective on recurring segments featuring Roland, showcasing clips of humiliating tasks he performed, including interviews, stand-up comedy, and a bathroom scene with Kelsey Grammer. A street stunt involving Roland and "Half a Hulk Face," a disfigured homeless man, soliciting money for photographs was shown, featuring the hosts providing increasingly outrageous suggestions via an earpiece, filled with offensive language and suggestions for soliciting money, including using charitable appeals or mentioning prostitution. The segment concluded with commentary on the money raised ($29 plus a $20 donation) and a humorous clip of someone being tased.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, this is Stacey Keech.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Prime...  Whoops.  Okay.  Prime time, Sam Roberts and E-Rock. 
[00:00:30]  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  They're not here today, so instead, you have us, Sam and E-Rock.  Happy Valentine's Day, everybody, and E-Rock, happy Valentine's Day to you.  And to you as well, Sam.  I got you a candy heart that says nice tits on it.  You got some nice ones.  Thanks.  I did get you something, but you threw it into the garbage.  What was it?  It was a gold rose from Steven Singer.  No, I like those roses.  Anywho, it's time to start this show.  E-Rock, what do we got?  Sam, we have in studio famous director Robert Rodriguez. 
[00:01:00]  Robert Rodriguez is actually a favorite director of mine.  He's done a lot of fun stuff.  I like his movies.  This one, I loved.  Grindhouse.  You're one of the few people that I know that actually did enjoy the entire thing.  Some people liked half.  Some people didn't like it at all.  I liked both Grindhouse movies.  I did like Tarantino's a little better, but I liked everything about it.  I loved the previews.  I even loved Machete.  It just came out recently.  I got that on Blu-ray, too.  What?  Where's the Rob Zombie, Wolfman, Nazi thing coming? 
[00:01:30]  Werewolf Women of the SS?  I don't know, but on the Grindhouse Blu-ray, it's got a whole making of the Werewolf Women  of the SS trailer.  Where is it?  That thing came out two years ago.  Yeah, with Nicolas Cage.  I don't know.  I would see that movie, too.  But Robert Rodriguez wouldn't direct it, and that's who we're talking about.  It's Robert Rodriguez in with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right on.  Let's get right into this.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show in studio.  Robert Rodriguez. 
[00:02:00]  What are you doing?  We're yapping.  We'll yap on the air, man.  What were you guys talking about?  I'm talking about the difference between watching a TV series on a box set, and then you get in  a hotel and you have to watch regular television, how much it sucks when you're sitting there  and you realize they rope you in because they give you a bunch of movie at first, and you're  like, oh, this is good.  Wow.  They haven't played a commercial in a long time.  And then toward the end, it's like five-second blips of the movie in between these huge stretches 
[00:02:30]  of commercial.  You want to kill somebody.  I'm a fan of the marathon, or getting the box set and just do it.  You were saying before the show, you did Lost all weekend, right?  Yeah.  You got to do that.  You just pop in disc after disc, and it's like when I go to Atlantic City or Vegas and  I'm playing poker, I'll just be like, all right, one more hand, one more hand.  And you pop in one more disc, and it ends, and you're like, I'd really want to know what  happens after that.  All right, one more disc. 
[00:03:00]  Just one more.  And before you know it, it's midnight, and you got to get up at four.  You got no sleep.  Can I ask Robert a question, dude?  If you did, I'm going to smash my fat face.  Did you direct Swimming with Sharks?  Swimming with Sharks is a friend of mine, George Wang, did that.  You love that movie.  He's a good friend of mine.  It's a brilliant film.  Yeah, Jimmy loves that movie.  He was an executive's assistant over at Columbia when I was there, and I kept telling him, man,  quit your job and go make a movie.  Look how easy it was for me.  I made all mariachi.  And then he quit his job, and it was a good job.  And I was like, oops.  I hope he makes a movie. 
[00:03:30]  And he did, and he made that terrific film.  Well, you're here to talk about Grindhouse, and the buzz on the movie is unbelievable.  The article's all over the place.  We had Kurt Russell in on Friday.  He was great for us, man.  And you direct the first film.  A lot of people got to understand, it's a double feature.  This is old school stuff.  It's really crazy.  Well, even in the old days, they wouldn't show two brand new movies together.  Right.  Usually one that had been around for a while, and then maybe a new movie put in together.  Right, right.  But this is just a, no, I had an idea about three years ago to do a double feature, because 
[00:04:00]  I'd done a 3D movie that did really well.  3D hadn't been around in a while, and it drew back, and now it brought back 3D.  There's a lot of 3D movies.  Sure.  I thought, what else was an old school, traditional way to show a movie that would rope in audiences  for today?  Because people have been talking about, you know, theatrical exhibition going down,  people staying at home more.  And so I thought, double feature would be really cool.  I took it to Quentin.  He loves double features.  I said, we got to call it Grindhouse.  And so in like five minutes, we came up with this idea to make this really unique experience 
[00:04:30]  where there'd be two features, two full features, each about 84, 85 minutes long.  And then trailers, fake trailers in between for movies that don't exist.  Yeah, I hear they're hysterical.  And I hear the trailers are just amazing for these movies that don't exist, almost to the  point where you might want to make one of these down the road.  We might have to make all of them.  Right.  You get such a huge response.  I could sit and watch like old school trailers for hours, man.  You get on some websites and watch them because they were so, you know, action packed.  No, they totally oversell them. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  The idea we had with Grindhouse was, you know, back in the day, they'd have these amazing  posters and trailers.  Then you'd go see the movie.  And the movie sucked.  Nothing like that.  Yeah.  So we thought, well, we have the, you know, the means and the time to actually make these  movies better than the posters and better than the trailers that we're selling.  And it's just wild to see it with an audience.  I mean, go with a group of friends and watch this movie because it's just, it's like a rock  concert.  People just go nuts because the movies are really short and it's just one hit after another  and people are just screaming.  Yeah.  That's what I hear, everybody. 
[00:05:30]  I can't wait to see it, man.  Absolutely.  It's over three hours.  It's just over three hours.  Yeah.  And we all get, what's funny is it doesn't feel that way because both movies are short.  So you forget that you even saw the first movie.  And after the second one, people are, every time we'd have a premiere screening, they go,  we wish you had double screenings because we just want to go right back in and experience  it again.  See it again.  Yeah.  It's almost like that, the phenomenon of watching your discs.  Yeah.  You know, once you put them in and you start watching, you just want to keep going.  The guys behind the scenes here, they all went already to see Grindhouse and huge thumbs 
[00:06:00]  up from the staff of the Opie and Anthony show.  Our audience is going to love, love it.  And you direct the first one, Planet Terror.  Planet Terror.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is there any connection between the two at all?  Any bleed in at all between the first and second feature?  There's supposed to be two completely different movies, but we ended up in grand fashion of  some of these double features.  Like sometimes you'd go see a Pam Grier double feature and she'd be in both movies, like  The Warden in one.  Right.  If it's a women in prison movie, she'd be a prisoner in the next one, even though they're  completely different movies.  Rose McGowan's in both.  A few characters are in both movies. 
[00:06:30]  We're obsessed with prison films.  They're hot.  Yeah.  Female prison films.  The old ones, yeah.  The old school ones.  You're going to like this movie.  This is like almost like a zombie movie, but then around midway through, it turns into  a women in cages movie for a bit.  Really?  Oh, cool.  About 20 minutes.  It goes into a different subgenre.  How great was it watching Linda Blair be held down?  What a naughty little convict she was.  Isn't that lovely?  That's right.  She was taught a lesson.  Oh, those were the best.  Those like Laura Gemzer, who was also played Black Emmanuel, used to do a couple of those 
[00:07:00]  two women prison films and really got me through, you know, like my 14 through 18 year Cinemax,  three in the morning, you know, bag whacking.  Lovely.  And that's what's cool about those movies.  People think that they're just exploitative, you know, to women.  And actually, they're very, they're empowering pictures.  And that's what we do in these, too.  I think women really love these movies because of the empowerment and the women really take over  the movie after a while.  I got to talk to you a little bit about Dusk Till Dawn.  Oh, yeah.  Unbelievable.  Loved it.  I remember I went into a blockbuster.  It was when we were up in Boston and I used to watch a lot of videos before we had to be 
[00:07:30]  there.  We were doing afternoon drive.  It was the bomb.  You didn't have to like wake up, stay up as late as you want, out all night.  Who can't be to work by 3 p.m.?  You know, it was one of those deals.  So I watched videos beforehand.  So I went there and I picked that up.  It looked interesting.  Knew nothing about it.  And the girl at the counter says, have you seen this?  And she goes, did you look at the back of the box or anything?  I said, no.  She goes, good.  Just watch it.  Don't look at anything.  I'm like, okay, what the hell were you guys thinking?  Did you think like people are going to like this or that it's weird that it goes from 
[00:08:00]  this really cool, like that movie could have just been about these two criminals.  Right.  And we used to say the best way, we said it's too bad that people are seeing it in theaters  right now because the trailer gives away that it's vampires.  The best way to see this movie is later when someone's watching it on cable or on tape  and they pop it in and they know nothing about it.  That's how I saw it.  It was like, what the hell is going?  It's a vampire movie.  You're like, what am I drinking?  Yeah.  What happened? 
[00:08:30]  It was a crime movie and it turns into a vampire movie.  What's funny about that is the script was like that too.  You'd be reading and you'd turn the page and go, wait, what happened?  Did they mix up the scripts here?  That was his first script and he couldn't get it made for years because people would  say, this is all wrong.  It's a Desperate Hours type movie in the first half and vampires, it makes no sense.  Get out of here.  And then Pulp Fiction hit and suddenly they were like, this is great.  It's like two movies in one.  Yeah.  And we're able to go make it off the success of Pulp Fiction.  Some tells me that that was the closest thing you're going to catch to Tarantino's personality 
[00:09:00]  too, was the way he was in From Dusk Till Dawn.  Just a psychopath.  That really, I think, grabbed him.  Where he's hearing the voices that aren't there in the head.  He wasn't really acting, was he?  That's him.  He actually came in with that character.  Oh, he was acting.  He was just really great to do.  And you know, it was a big surprise to me.  I was a big Pee-wee Herman fan watching the old HBO special of his Pee-wee's Playhouse  type thing where it was a little more risque than his television show. 
[00:09:30]  And there was a character on there named Hammy who used to put shoe mirrors on and look up  girls' skirts.  And it turned out to be the guy that was in the band at the Tiddy Twister.  That was my friend Tito Lariva.  Yeah.  Tito.  Who's really turned into a really good musician, I gather.  Oh, he's an amazing musician.  Yeah.  He's a musician first.  Because that song, I love listening to that song that's playing when, what's her name,  comes out and starts dancing on the table.  He's in Grindhouse where Danny Trejo's the star. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Machete.  And Cheech Marin's in it and that guy Tito's in it.  So you'll get a little...  Oh, cool.  ...go back to the Dustal Dungeons.  Yeah.  Danny turns up in everything.  He does.  But it was great to hear people just go ape for him, being the star of his own fake movie.  That's awesome.  Oh, he gets the women and he kills the bad guys.  What do you think is the best directed film I've ever seen?  The best directed films?  Yeah.  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  Okay.  Oh, I love it.  That was the... 
[00:10:30]  And back at the time, it was just kind of ignored.  Stuff really holds up.  Yeah, it holds up.  You know, you watch that.  Some of the shooting scenes are fantastic.  Like, people not just doing that, grab their heart and fall down or something like that.  It's the...  You know, you feel the power of it.  The guy spins around and hits the ground, which I just thought was great on those old movies.  I think he was the first guy to shoot, actually, like, in one frame, like, while both people  were on camera without cutting.  Like, I think he was the first guy to actually show us shooting while we were both in the  same frame. 
[00:11:00]  Really?  Just until you get shot.  Yeah.  I think he was the first guy to do that.  Boring fact.  Good.  And, of course, one of these things that it's an urban legend about you.  I don't know if true or not.  But the wheelchair dolly.  Oh, no, absolutely.  You used to use a wheelchair for a dolly.  You used to actually have a cameraman in a wheelchair.  I was the cameraman.  You were the cameraman, of course.  I had one of the other actors push me, and it was in Mexico when I shot El Mariachi.  There was a little hospital right there next to my friend's house, so we went and borrowed  their one wheelchair, and we'd go down, push down the street, and it would be cool because 
[00:11:30]  I'd be looking up at the actors because I was sitting, and it would give real heroic-type  shots.  And during one of the shots, a guy runs out from the hospital and said, we have a patient  coming in.  We need the wheelchair back.  Take your dolly away.  One wheelchair they had.  Good place to get surgery.  All right.  One knife, guys spitting on it, putting it on his shirt.  Hey, what's the deal with the medical experiments back in the day?  Well, that's how I funded my...  Yeah, I was reading up on you, and I guess to raise money, you'd let them experiment with 
[00:12:00]  your body a little bit.  Experiment on me, yeah.  Cool.  We've done shows on this, and they'll call like crazy, like, yeah, I tried this new drug  for schizophrenia or whatever, but...  Well, every drug that comes out has to go through an extensive...  Right.  But some of these are really risky, because we read an article, and you could get a lot  of money, because some of...  You know, they need people, but it's a little risky.  Yeah, the riskier, the more money you make.  So they get the drunk college kids, and like...  Well, no, totally.  I mean, Austin, Texas is the biggest college town, so they have a big place there called 
[00:12:30]  Pharmaco, or at least they used to when I was there, and they would just draw people  in by the thousands that needed money, and I know I had two jobs just for tuition in  my apartment, so if I wanted to make a movie, I had to go make a score like that, where  I was stuck in there for a month and make $3,000 or whatever.  The worst one was, I was really excited, because it was a seven-day study, and you got $2,000.  I was like, wow, $2,000 for seven days?  Nice.  I wonder what they'd do to you.  I need it.  So you go in there, and you sign up, and then they tell you what it is, and they say, it's  a speed healer drug. 
[00:13:00]  You know, how do you test it?  Oh, no.  They wound you.  And you're listening to this, that they're going to take two butt punch biopsies out of  the back of your arm, you know, put speed healer on one, placebo on the other, then cut  away that section of the arm, sew you back up.  Ew.  And you're like, uh, it doesn't sound very good, but mentally, we already spent that money.  And you're kind of like, oh, I hate, that sounds, well, I guess it's just a small hole, but  then you have two identical scars on the back of your arm, which looks really stupid when  you're on the beach.  Yeah, what the hell happened? 
[00:13:30]  Every once in a while, I write into people in town in Austin that have the same scars,  I was like, it's like the brotherhood.  Hey, remember me?  Remember that time?  Damn, that's horrible.  It was, but then you took the money, and I bought like a video camera, went and shot movies,  and it worked out for you.  Yeah, it worked out good.  What did a mariachi cost you?  That was seven grand.  Seven grand.  People thought that was like so cheap, and I thought, man, do you have seven grand?  That's a lot of money.  You're in college, it's a lot of money.  Yeah.  Were you surprised, though, that that storyline was able to launch you into like feature film? 
[00:14:00]  Well, yeah, the plan, I had a really good plan.  I thought, I'm going to go make three low-budget Mexican action movies in Spanish, and just  put them in the Spanish section.  No one will even know it's me, and just sell them to the Spanish video.  That's why it's in Spanish, and get my practice that way.  I'll be the whole crew.  I'll learn how to do photography, lighting.  I'll make like three of them to really get better, and then I'll go with the money from  that and make my first American independent film, but the first mariachi movie ended up  being released by Columbia Pictures, and that was my practice film. 
[00:14:30]  How did that happen?  I sent it to an agent to see what he thought of me making three of those, and he said,  well, this is great.  Let me send it as an example to the studios, and then they bought it and decided to remake  it, but then when they looked at it closer, they said, well, let's send this to film festivals,  and ended up winning Sundance and winning festivals, and people really got inspired by the fact  that I made it so inexpensively, and that's what started this whole revolution of independent  filmmakers making really low-budget movies themselves.  The film is called Grindhouse, and I love what they gave you guys on the cover of Entertainment 
[00:15:00]  Weekly.  One double feature, two wild directors, three bloody hours.  They just give you guys a really nice...  Well, there hasn't been a film made like this.  Never, yeah.  I mean, I hope everyone understands it's going to be quite the experience in the theater.  What really is cool is that when you sit there, that's what you feel.  It's like, I've never seen anything.  It's like a cinema circus, because there's so much going on, different filmmakers contributing  the trailers.  You got Rob Zombie.  Yeah, Rob Zombie.  He did one of the fake trailers.  Eli Roth.  Right, Eli Roth, sure. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, myself, I did one.  And I think people are just going to feel ripped off now when they go to a regular movie,  and they just see one picture with commercials in front of it.  Yeah, yeah.  This is just so, so cool.  I got to tell you, everyone finds a reviewer they respect, and the guy I respect is Kevin  Smith.  He's on our show a lot.  But his quote is simple, Kevin Smith's thoughts on Grindhouse, effing loved it.  Effing fantastic, so insanely good, three hours long, but he would have sat through it  again had they offered to rerun it right away. 
[00:16:00]  See it as soon as you can.  That's from Kevin Smith, and a guy we definitely, we talk movies with from time to time and respect.  So I'm going today.  I'm going to one of those.  Yeah, I'm going today at 6 o'clock if you want to go, Jimmy.  Either that, or I've got plans to stalk Black Sabbath at XM.  So if I'm not there, I'm going to be thrown out by their people.  I'll go see if, if not, I'll wait until Friday.  Yeah, if you go Friday, it'll be the hardcore crowd always going on Friday.  That's going to be sick.  That's going to be unbelievable.  That's a movie to see in the theater with a lot of people.  It is. 
[00:16:30]  It just, it turns into a rock concert.  Yeah.  It really does.  A lot of experience, definitely.  Quentin would call me the next morning after each screening like that and go, did that  really happen?  He just kept thinking it didn't happen.  It was, he didn't know how we're going to top this now.  We got him tomorrow.  Oh, he's going to tell you how exciting it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got any dirt on him?  Dirt on Quentin?  Yeah, give us a little something we can like hit him with.  Nothing, nothing on Quentin.  I was reading up on him.  I've only known him 14 years.  Over the weekend.  And he was talking about his movie nights at his house.  That's got to be just one of the most amazing things to be part of.  Well, that's one of the, that was why I sort of wanted to make this movie. 
[00:17:00]  I'd go to, you go to his house and he shows a double feature and puts trailers in between  and it's so much fun.  You just go, man, this is so much better than seeing movie in a regular theater.  We got to recreate this experience for, for the people around the world.  And that's where it began.  And that's where it began.  And it's not the films like, you know, oh, let's see Caddyshack and Animal House.  It's like.  Some of them are some really good ones.  Yeah, like black exploitation films, prison flicks.  Kung fu movies.  Kung fu, all that stuff.  Right.  All the, all the bad B movies. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, the other thing about Grindhouse really fast.  The ratings board gave you a little problem.  No, they didn't.  But in the end, you guys walked out of that meeting kind of happy that they didn't cut  it too bad.  Yeah, no, it was a rumor that they hadn't even seen it yet.  And we actually were a little disappointed they didn't give us that much draw.  Oh, really?  No, they totally got it.  The tone of the movie is one that's not, you know, people don't really know sometimes  what Grindhouse means.  They just think it's a house where people go in and get grinded up.  Right.  It's like, no, it's a reference to the old theaters.  But no, it wasn't, it wasn't bad at all.  Okay.  It gave us no trouble. 
[00:18:00]  I heard about a trampoline scene.  Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to see.  Oh, no, you see that.  Oh, no, it's there.  It's there.  They just cut it a little bit.  All right.  They just put some scratches.  It hadn't been aged yet because the movie looks like it's been aged.  Yeah, that's what they did too.  They scratched up the film a little bit, make it feel like it was made a while ago.  And some scenes just end and says scene missing or something like that.  There's sometimes a whole section missing.  And when you come back, half the people are dead.  The person's left with that person.  It really plays with that whole idea.  People just go crazy for that.  They love that. 
[00:18:30]  And you totally can pick up where it left.  And I have a feeling you guys have a hell of a DVD on your hands.  A hell of a DVD is coming.  I can only imagine.  But the movie itself is going to be great.  The reviews so far are unbelievable.  Robert Rodriguez from Grindhouse.  Thank you very much, man.  Absolutely.  He directs the first film, Planet Terror, that you're going to see.  Tarantino directs the second one, stars Kurt Russell, Rose McGowan.  And it's just an amazing film.  Everyone has raved about it.  And we'll continue in just a minute.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sam, after the break, this bit centers around Opie. 
[00:19:00]  He's out riding his bicycle.  Yes.  Opie got a ticket for riding his bicycle.  He goes so fast.  Find out what happens next when we get back.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  Sam and pretty much the whole audience knows that Opie's not one to sit indoors all day.  No, he's an outdoorsy guy.  He's athletic.  First, it was rollerblading.  It was running.  He also loves to jump on a bicycle from time to time. 
[00:19:30]  He goes up and down the west side of Manhattan from the Upper West Side down to the Battery Park, which is the southern end of Manhattan.  But at this particular point, he decided to take the bike on a pier.  Yeah, I mean, this is the thing about Opie.  You don't give a fuck.  You don't just be like, whatever, dude.  This is Opie's time.  You don't give a fuck until he gets a ticket.  Well, he did.  He ran into the long arm of the law.  Meter made.  Meter made.  And it got Opie and Anthony talking about the fake cops in New York City and the way traffic cops think that they should be treated as if they're legitimate. 
[00:20:00]  It's Opie and Anthony getting, well, not Opie and Anthony, just Opie, getting pulled over because he's riding his bike on the show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  So, um, I got a ticket from a golf cart cop yesterday.  Now, all right, let's get this straight right from the top.  Jimmy knows where I'm now living.  Is it a golf cart cop or a golf cart traffic person? 
[00:20:30]  Was it an actual officer of the law?  Oh, she is a, uh, she is a plebe that works for the Environmental Control Board.  What?  So she's not a real cop?  Let me just put it this way.  After this all went down, I called, uh, some of my NYPD friends.  Yeah.  They just openly laughed at me on the phone.  Openly laughed.  Well, they should.  And I didn't even call him asking for, like, you know, is there something I could do about this?  I didn't.  I really didn't.  What color was her uniform?  Green?  It was, uh, like a park, yeah, with a leaf badge. 
[00:21:00]  It was canary, like, yellow, beige, a little bit of green.  Are you kidding me?  Dude, I almost got arrested yesterday.  You don't even understand.  How did you get a ticket?  I almost got arrested.  And I called the NYPD boys just, just to, just, just to vent.  And I thought I would get a little love in return.  Instead, I just got nothing but laughter on the phone.  Nothing but laughter.  And they basically said, you can rip this thing up.  This is, this is tickets they give out to, like, vendors.  They just want to, you know, you know, get rid of some, yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Or some old lady that might leave a little, a little, little poop on the sidewalk.  And what was yours given for?  Actually, some of the NYPD that I called, I called a few of them.  They don't even know what this organization is.  The Environmental Control Board.  Was the woman was not a cop who gave it?  Did she have a gun?  No.  She had a walkie-talkie, and she used it to, uh, to call backup.  Backup?  Oh, no.  Which was more golf cart cops.  Oh, I hope he was making a scene.  You can't even call them golf cart cops.  That's an insult to the NYPD. 
[00:22:00]  It's even an insult to the stupid meter maids out there.  This is below the meter maid crap.  Below the meter maids.  Yeah.  Oh.  So, you know, a lot of stress lately, moving into a new place and, uh, you know, reworking  the radio show.  Just a lot going on.  So, uh, late in the day yesterday, I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to go for a bike ride and, and, uh, and relieve a little stress.  So I, I, I go on a bike ride.  I run into Stephen Lynch.  It's a huge city of how many million?  And I run into Stephen Lynch. 
[00:22:30]  We talk for like 15 or 20 minutes.  Would you ride over him when he was passed out somewhere?  A speed bump?  Next time you see Stephen Lynch go, nice basket on your bike, dick.  Does he have a basket on his bike?  Dude, a huge basket on the back of his bike.  How else can he hold his booze?  No.  He's got like 24 Meister brows in it.  A little warm.  A huge, huge basket on his bike.  And he sees me and he goes, hey, I'm listening to the show.  And I'm like, stop listening to the show, you freak. 
[00:23:00]  You stalker.  How about you come on it?  Yeah, that's what I said.  Exactly.  So, uh, I laugh at his big, huge basket and he goes, oh, I got a big basket to bring my beer  home.  Yeah.  Tries to make it, tries to make it cool, but it's still like kind of a dorky big basket.  Flowers on it.  It's tough to get a real workout in when you got a huge basket on the back of your, on  the back of your bike.  So at the end of my run, I decide, uh, there's this pier.  This is, there's this pier.  I'm like, you know what?  I want to go, uh, I want to go to the end of the pier and check out, check out, uh, the 
[00:23:30]  river there.  So I go out to the bike.  I ride it maybe a mile an hour.  There's not a soul on this pier.  It's late in the day.  Uh-oh.  I go out, I check the view.  I'm like, ah, this is kind of a cool spot.  So then I decide, uh, to turn around and-  Was there a sign?  Well, I'll get to that.  All right.  I'm just, I'm just trying to see.  Honestly, I did not see any sign.  Oh no, ignorance.  But, uh, power trip twat had a, had a point out where the sign was. 
[00:24:00]  Is that her name?  Yes.  Absolutely.  It's on the ticket.  So, uh, so then I, I'm going about a mile.  On my favorite clip.  I'm sorry.  I'm going about a mile an hour off the pier and, uh, I get off the pier and I start,  uh, on my way.  And all of a sudden I hear, hey, hey, like some lady losing her mind.  I'm like, what is that?  And it's the golf cart lady in this, like, you know, canary, yellow, green, beige looking 
[00:24:30]  outfit.  You stopped more out of curiosity than anything else.  Thank you, Anthony.  Because you should have just kept riding.  Well, because I'm like, what could possibly be the problem?  What is this?  Of course I stopped out of curiosity.  Would you lose your ball?  You need a, what, a title list?  What are you shooting?  Tell you the truth.  I thought she was yelling at somebody else.  I'm like, what?  You know, there's no way she's yelling at me.  And I look and she's yelling at me and she's coming at me with her golf cart and stops and  jumps out.  And she's like, uh, why are you riding on the pier? 
[00:25:00]  She's yelling at me.  I'm like, uh, because I didn't know you couldn't.  Because it's there and I figured I'd ride to the end and come back.  She goes, didn't you see the sign?  She points to a sign like over in another area.  I'm like, no.  What does the sign say?  I did not see it.  You have to walk your bike on the pier.  So it's not even like you're not allowed to have bikes on the pier.  You're allowed to have a bike on the pier as long as you walk it.  Walk your bike.  I was riding mine maybe a mile in an hour.  You rebel. 
[00:25:30]  You criminal.  So I'm like, all right, well, I didn't know.  Thanks for letting me know.  And I get on my bike to go.  She goes, ah, ID.  I'm like, what?  I'm like, you're joking, right?  She goes, no, ID.  I go, I don't carry an ID on me.  I'm riding my bike.  She goes, I'll take a verbal.  What's your name?  A verbal.  I'm like, I'm not giving you my name.  All of a sudden, she calls backup on her walkie-talkie, and more golf cart twats come flying into the area.  How was her backup call? 
[00:26:00]  What did she say?  Did she say we got a 136 or something?  Was there a code word for her?  All I heard was pier, hurry up, get here, a-hole in front of me type of thing.  I don't remember the code thing.  So then there's a backup lady that's looking all tough.  I'm like, this is a joke, right?  I thought this was like a can of camera or something.  Racial background of both women?  Why don't you figure it out?  Why don't you figure it out?  Let me think.  Okay.  Let's figure it out. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Very good.  It took you a long time.  I wish you were giving time for each one.  So I go, why do you need my name?  Why do you need this verbal name thing?  And she goes, because I'm giving you a ticket.  I'm like, wait, can't you let me go?  I didn't know, obviously.  Why would I do this if I knew?  I just moved into the area, which is the God's honest truth.  Can you let me go?  And this is when it just pissed me off.  She goes, if I let you go, then what is the purpose of my job? 
[00:27:00]  Exactly.  I'm like, you're kidding, right?  So now we're going at it big time.  I'm like, I ain't giving you my name.  I'll give you a verbal, Jim Norton.  That's what I would have done.  Oh, would I have done that.  Jimmy, and you know what?  I was this close to giving your name knowing that you would never be on a bike.  No, why would I be?  Yeah, so I'm like, I paid that ticket.  Right.  Knowing I'd be on the pier, I know better.  So Al, I walk my bike on the pier.  So Al better be ready down the hall.  I'm like, you're really writing me a ticket for going a mile an hour on a pier? 
[00:27:30]  I'll be ready.  You're giving me a ticket?  She goes, yes, I am.  Yeah.  Can she let me go?  No!  I mean, she's losing her mind.  Like, acting all tough.  She wants to be a cop, but obviously she'll never be a cop.  Oh, of course not.  So she's on this big, huge power trip.  So she's writing out the ticket.  I give her my real name because I don't know if somehow this is connected to the real boys,  the NYPD, and I could get into some real trouble. 
[00:28:00]  And they rely on that, by the way.  Like, that fear that they rely on the fact that you're not too sure how connected they are.  I really, I mean, I wimped out.  I gave my real name because I don't know if there's some strange connection with the guys  that do the real work out there.  Legally, you actually can punch her off her golf cart.  You know, dude, it got close to some serious crap.  I'm telling you right now because her attitude was ridiculous.  I mean, it was, what's wrong?  What happened?  I don't know. 
[00:28:30]  It's Sal.  Oh, what's up?  We're on the air, Sal.  In the middle of a pretty good story.  Yeah.  Uh, no, unless it's, like, life-threatening.  All right, as long as the family's okay, then I have to do a radio show.  All right, Sal, I'll call you on a break.  Okay.  All right, bye.  Doesn't know you do a radio show yet?  You know how, like, parents are?  They don't get this.  They think we're, like, in a clubhouse in a tree somewhere. 
[00:29:00]  Like, putting on a show for our friends.  But when you see a family number pop up during the show, you're like,  Yeah, I had to answer.  I had to answer.  No, I understand.  You know, especially this early, I'm thinking, all right, I got to leave.  Someone's dead.  But, no.  I thought it was a phone call from someone saying,  Shut up, Opie.  No one cares.  No.  It's actually very relatable.  I love these stories because there are so many of these organizations out there that throw around this fake authority.  Well, one of my NYPD friends said that this is a scam. 
[00:29:30]  It's a way that the city can bring in a little money for ridiculous things.  Because it's like, she was treating me like I exposed myself to kids or was selling drugs openly on the streets.  How do you know what those treatments are?  What?  How do you know what those treatments are?  Yeah.  I, yeah.  I, yeah.  I, yeah.  Oh, well, I.  But I'm sitting there like, she's yelling at me and giving me the business because I was going one mile an hour on a pier that no one was on.  And, obviously, it's not even well marked.  It's a sign with a temporary, like, fence on the other side because there's many ways to hit this pier. 
[00:30:00]  Right?  So, finally, she's writing the ticket.  And I'm like, Just give me the ticket.  She goes, Don't you want to know how to take care of it?  I'm like, No, give me the ticket.  Take care of it.  I'm like, Give me the ticket.  So, she gives me the ticket.  She goes, Have a nice day.  And, Al, I hope you're ready because I looked her right in the eye, made sure we had eye contact.  And I go, Can you do a letter?  Blow me. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, no.  Wow.  And then she got on her walkie-talkie again.  I don't know who the hell she was calling.  Do they have somebody that responds when you tell one of these women to give you little sexual favors?  Look, man, you say that to the NYPD, you know, you're going down.  Oh, yeah.  That's obvious.  But I'm like, You know what?  No way.  No way.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But I looked her right in the eye and I said that.  Blank me.  I'm like, Blank me.  Yeah.  And I took off and then I got back to my apartment and I called all the NYPD guys just to rant and they're all like laughing openly at me. 
[00:31:00]  That is a joke.  You got a ticket from a golf cart twat.  They were calling her that.  That's how I came up with that little saying today.  So, it's the Environmental Control Board.  $50 ticket for, I observed respondent riding bicycle on pier.  Oh, God.  Signs are clearly posted that you're not allowed to do this.  You have to walk your bike. 
[00:31:30]  That's in the details of violation.  What a loser.  I want to know what happens if you, like, with traffic cops, I know they do have a certain amount of authority.  They're not cops.  There's traffic, whatever they are.  Yeah, whatever they are.  But they are standing in the middle of the street controlling traffic.  I mean, they're doing something that the NYPD, they're probably giving them real cops a break so they don't have to stand there and control traffic.  What would have happened if you just refused to give this woman any information until a real cop showed up?  No, I would have just taken off at that point. 
[00:32:00]  But, I mean, what would happen if you said, I'm not giving you any information, drop dead, call whoever you want.  And then if a real cop came, you'd give him whatever he wants.  Well, here's the other problem.  I know I'm going to be doing a lot of biking in that area, so I know, like, if I just took off, which I could easily, I could easily outbike a stupid golf cart.  They'd put an APP out on you?  Well, I'd be in that area enough where they would, you know, they would eventually get me for whatever.  Just wave to her every time.  Hey.  But as she's running the ticket, I'm saying stuff like, wow, you must have a miserable life.  Because as soon as they start writing the ticket, you know, in the middle of writing the ticket, they're not going to go, you know what? 
[00:32:30]  I changed my mind.  I will give you a warning.  As soon as they start writing, that means start insulting the hell out of them, especially if they're one of these, you know, one of these things.  What would happen if they don't do anything important for the city?  You should have videotaped it.  It's not even about the money.  I know, but how much?  It's only $50.  She goes.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah.  But I just started, oh, you must have a miserable life.  Boy, you're really tough.  How's that career going?  Thought you'd be one of Charlie's Angels, didn't you? 
[00:33:00]  Saying all sorts of stuff like that.  And here you are, writing me a ticket for riding my bicycle.  I did say, what's the matter?  Not good enough to make the actual police force.  Oh, that gets it.  That gets them.  That's when she looked at me like she thought she had me hands over the ticket.  And have a nice day.  I go, blank me.  Blank me.  They hear that from people.  I had a traffic guy.  Because these people never give you a break because they want the power of cops.  But cops will a lot of times give you a break if you're driving. 
[00:33:30]  Hey, man, I got to get through this barrack.  Like if they're blocking off a parade route.  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm doing a show down here.  The ones that won't are those scum that are not real cops.  They just love the power.  They have no power in their real lives.  And that's where they feel good.  That's why I turn.  I don't make eye contact with them.  A lot of times when traffic is a little heavy on 57th and I have to turn on to 57th,  they will make people go up one of the other avenues.  And it takes me so far out of the way. 
[00:34:00]  So I just start making the turn.  And they'll go like, hey, hey.  And I won't make eye contact.  I'll just continue making my turn.  And go right past them.  They jump in front of you sometimes.  I've seen them do that to people.  Oh, go ahead, go ahead.  Jump in front of me.  Well, now because, you know.  Put it in reverse.  Go around them.  I'm new to the area.  Now I know the deal.  If these stupid golf cart twats yell out to me, I'm just going to keep going really,  you know, really fast and just out bike them and go, I didn't hear no stupid golf cart horn.  I got pulled over by a golf cart. 
[00:34:30]  And she had to call golf cart backup.  That seems like it would ruin the environment more than a bicycle.  The golf carts.  Right.  Are they propane golf carts?  Are they battery powered?  Either way, you know, they're using power.  You're just trying to help the environment, riding your little bicycle.  Just a complete power tripped twat.  He has a little power and she's going to control the pier.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's wrong?  So many ways.  Oh.  They just grab money from people in this city. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, that's getting dumped every time?  Every time?  What is?  Yeah.  The T word.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That one's been on the list for a while.  All right.  Well, whatever.  I'll get some down the hall.  So there you go.  There's my little afternoon yesterday when I was just trying to let off a little steam.  Which?  It got a little ugly.  A little ugly.  Good.  A little ugly.  I wasn't going to let her get the upper hand in the hand.  Don't give them any respect.  I want to know from a cop, though, what would have happened if you just refused to give her 
[00:35:30]  any information?  Like, not do anything threatening towards her, but just refuse to acknowledge that she  was talking to you.  Yeah.  Would she have to just call, like, a real cop?  Which probably would annoy him.  Oh, the cop.  He would take his time.  He wouldn't deal with that.  And by the way.  He's fighting real stuff in this city.  I do have a problem with your story.  Why?  Were you carrying ID, or were you just telling her you didn't have ID?  No, I didn't have ID.  All right.  What the f- what are you doing?  What?  I'm serious.  What? 
[00:36:00]  You carry ID with you all the time.  Not when I'm biking in my-  Yes, when you're biking.  I don't carry ID.  Why wouldn't you carry your ID?  Here's a scenario.  Something happens.  You're laying there.  They don't know who the F you are.  And now you get taken to a hospital.  No one knows who to call for a medical proxy.  No one knows anything.  No one knows if you're insured or anything.  They throw you in some hell hole, and you wind up croaking.  You gotta have your ID with you 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
[00:36:30]  When you are out, you constantly have your ID with you.  Thanks, Buzzkill.  I'm just saying that's very important that you carry your ID.  I was just going for a leisurely bike ride.  Doesn't matter.  Kenny, tell him.  I don't need ID, right, Kenny?  Kenny, be honest.  Kenny will tell you now, as an officer of the law, what repercussions of not having  an ID.  Go ahead, Kenny.  Anthony, I'm not an officer of the law.  But former.  Anthony. 
[00:37:00]  Be honest.  You were always right, and Opie is always right.  Shouldn't people carry ID?  Let's say it's not Opie.  Look, man.  Shouldn't people carry their ID with them at all times?  Look, people should make a good account for themselves.  Look, it might.  If your scenario comes to, you know, tuition.  Tuition.  If you have to pay for school during that.  Sam, after the break, this bit just says, dyke gym teachers. 
[00:37:30]  Well, then I guess it's about you.  It doesn't make any sense.  It's coming up next.  Sam, in this particular segment, they're discussing a story about a kid who went into cardiac arrest  in gym class because he got hit with a baseball bat.  Well, a lot of gym class activities can be dangerous and were more dangerous in the past. 
[00:38:00]  This is how it leads.  Opie and Anthony start talking about how dangerous gym class could be, which somehow leads into  lesbian gym teachers.  This, I believe, is the start of the infamous Coach with the Whistle.  Yes.  Don't take E-Rock's word for it.  Don't take my word for it.  Listen for yourself right now.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's say hi to Mike in Georgia.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey there, Mike.  Hey there, Opie and Anthony.  Love you.  Love the show. 
[00:38:30]  Thanks.  What's up, Mike?  Uh, you know, I've just been listening to this Mayor Bloomberg thing, too, and, you know,  I'm not a rocket scientist or anything.  I didn't, uh, I, um, forget it.  I was going to comment on how he sounded like one, and it surprised me, but it came out,  I didn't, and ruined the whole thing.  I'm figuring that, you know, what gave the kid the cardiac arrest was more or less the,  uh, ball and not the bat.  Well, agreed, but they're saying that the ball hit him a lot harder because, uh, the 
[00:39:00]  kid was using, uh, using an aluminum bat.  Well, you know, let's, you know, they got an elbow guard, they got a face guard, they got  a toe guard, they got a knee guard, they got a crotch guard.  Why don't you give him a chest guard and let him go play?  Well, how about this?  Not every kid should be playing baseball.  Well, there you go.  For some reason in America, every kid has to play baseball.  If you can't take a liner to the chest, you shouldn't be playing?  A little, a little tip to the parents out there.  When your kid's in the backyard, maybe try to figure out what they might be good at. 
[00:39:30]  If it's ballet?  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  Like, I say it all the time, but it's been a lot of fun watching my, uh, my wool, my little  nephews grow up and I go to these games.  They go to the, the peewee hockey games and the little league games and stuff.  And, uh, thank God, you know, my nephews, they got, they got some skills, uh, you know,  but you go to some of these games and you see some of these kids that they have no  business being on the baseball field.  Yeah, maybe they should be on the, in drama class.  You could, you could tell even at a very early age that, uh, some of these kids will do much 
[00:40:00]  better on a stage, if you know what I mean.  Maybe they should be doing a flower arrangements, something like that.  Whatever.  And not be on the field.  But every, I guess every father wants their son to be a baseball star in America.  So, uh, you know, everyone, everyone throws their kid into the old pool and they just  hope they got a major leaguer.  And dad's the last one to pull them out of there because dad really wants him to, uh,  be a sports kid.  And I tell the story, a kid on first base while the game's going on, kind of like just twirling 
[00:40:30]  around like a ballerina.  Yeah.  And then the, the, the son's father's on the sideline, just mortified, just trying to get  the kid down into the position, into the first base position.  Kid doesn't care.  He wants to be on a stage.  He wants to go do anything but baseball, but it's obvious the father's kind of pushing  this on him.  Did you?  I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I used to spin in a circle.  It was a nervous tick I had.  I would spin once in a circle to the right. 
[00:41:00]  That's so stupid.  Once in a circle only.  Things are wrong.  Things are wrong.  Spin.  Yeah.  All's well.  And I was playing for Young's Glass Service in fourth grade and I was in the outfield  and I was spinning, occasionally spinning.  And my coach screamed from the sidelines, hey, Jimmy, what are you, a ballerina?  I was in right field.  Yeah.  Of course you are.  Both teams, all the fathers heard it.  Oh, it was awful.  Well, they were probably all looking at you going, what is he doing spinning around? 
[00:41:30]  Way to not wait until I get back into the dugout, coach.  How about a little quiet talking to?  No, you got to make an example.  How about you take me to the side when no one's looking?  Oh, boy.  He took me right out of ballerina school, though.  I quit spinning.  Did you stop spinning after that?  No, you're not.  But did you look kind of, you know, limp-wristed while doing it?  No.  That's what I'm talking about.  You spun like a man.  Oh, yeah, I'll show you, which doesn't work on radio.  Yeah, but I want to see it anyway. 
[00:42:00]  But it would just be a spin, like you'd have to take, like, a...  Okay, that's silly.  Yeah.  Were your hands on your hips like that?  Or whatever.  Or just whatever you were doing.  And then you did that and everything was right with the world, right?  I don't know why, yeah.  Man.  It's like that.  So when you said ballerina, boy, that touched off a lovely memory.  All you have to do, though, is go to one game and you realize who's there to play baseball  and who's there because daddy wants them to be a baseball star.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  I was never a sports guy. 
[00:42:30]  You are, obviously, you know, talking all the time about basketball and things like that.  Were you one of those, though, where dad would show up and be proud of your prowess out on the field or something?  Well, my dad was a basketball star back in the day.  Had a tryout for the Knicks.  That's the big story in my family.  But he blew it off because of personal issues with his first wife.  I'm sure he never regretted that one. 
[00:43:00]  Well, she never looked back with regret on that.  She ended up dying.  Jesus.  He decided to be with his dying wife instead of tryout for the Knicks.  I think it was pretty...  Hey, you're not going to get a tear from me.  That's terrific.  You're not going to get a tear from me, Ant.  That's the only reason I'm here.  A fine tragedy like that, that's the only reason I'm on this earth.  I was only joking.  Because then he turned around and married my mom and had six lovely kids. 
[00:43:30]  So there you go.  You wouldn't have been here.  But we were brought up with basketball in our blood, kind of.  Although I'd never had the height.  And that was my sport.  I tried the Little League.  And I was like, Jimmy, I was right fielder.  I was scared to be in the batter's box.  I realized early on that's what I'm getting at.  Yeah, I got some knowledge.  I realized early on I don't want to play baseball.  I like playing in the schoolyard with my friends when there's no pressure  and there's no kid trying to throw a ball as hard as he can  and he has no freaking control. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  That was never fun for me.  So I said, you know what?  Basketball and running and other things were much more my speed.  I had a good arm.  I could throw really far, really hard, but nothing else.  I was a disaster as far as any kind of sports went.  It was just awful.  What was your favorite sport?  None.  None sport.  Not one sport where you enjoyed it.  There was nothing I did.  I'm not talking about making the high school team or anything, 
[00:44:30]  but just one sport growing up where you're like, you know what?  I like this.  For me, it was basketball.  I could play basketball, and I did when I was a kid like 12 hours a day.  Hated basketball.  I was bad at everything.  Like I was bad at everything.  I liked dodgeball because I could throw the ball pretty hard,  and I was really skinny, so I was hard to hit.  That's a sport you play with girls.  No, no, no.  It's a sport.  It's not even a sport.  It's a dumb game you play in gym class.  It's recreation.  Yeah, it's recreation.  It's not a sport.  But that was it. 
[00:45:00]  I mean, things like baseball, I was always the kid that even if I connected  with the ball, it was an infield out.  It was done.  I couldn't get it over the goddamn heads of the infield.  And two-hand touch football, it's ridiculous.  What am I going to do?  I wasn't big enough to do any blocking, that's for sure,  and I couldn't get away from anybody.  So I'd just get slaughtered.  I was a little like string bean.  Hockey, there was no hockey. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, I loved hockey growing up.  We used to play stupid like a floor hockey.  I loved floor hockey.  In gym, and there was always the big douche who would have to check you  against the accordion door that separated you from the girls.  All I pictured were horrified girls looking as they're playing whatever they  did over there with their dyke teacher.  All right, girls, time to climb the rope.  I'll be holding the bottom.  I'll be holding the knot.  Make sure you wear your skirts.  Get those panties off, girls.  As they see the accordion door just get pushed in because another skinny kid's 
[00:46:00]  getting his head smashed as they check.  Yeah.  Shower time, girls.  Coach, we just got out here.  Shower.  Listen to me.  We're all showering today.  The dyke girl gym teacher.  Why was the gym teacher ever called out for being a dyke, ever?  Every one of them.  Every single one of them was a lesbian in hiding.  And the guy gym teacher was the opposite of that, was like all man ready to punch a 
[00:46:30]  fifth grader in the face.  He was just a miserable F.  Like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman coming into your...  Every male gym teacher was a failed athlete.  Yeah, yeah.  He kind of made it to like the farm team or minor league this, minor league that.  They all got a story.  Or went to Europe to play his sport.  And then finally he had nothing left.  So he's like teaching gym class to a bunch of freaking burnouts. 
[00:47:00]  And the goof to all those guys is, well, you watch, you'll be teaching gym class.  No, I won't.  You know, I'm making the cut.  I'm going to make the team.  And then they don't make it and they take out all their aggression and aggravation on  kids.  But dude, in my junior high and high school, the female gym teacher, she was more of a  male than I was.  Yeah.  Like no one noticed this.  And she was allowed access to the...  Oh, smorgasbord for her.  To the dressing room or the showers, whatever. 
[00:47:30]  Locker rooms.  Whatever.  The showers.  Because you never think that the gym teacher could be a lesbian.  Like she's just kind of, you know, monitoring and watching out for the girls.  She's a tomboy that never grew out of it.  And she's 45 years old.  With the short hair and the big oversized sweatshirt.  Short gray hair.  You know the look.  Like what is going on here?  Protect your...  Awful.  And when you're in junior high, as a girl especially, you have no clue about being a  lesbian.  You have no idea for the most part. 
[00:48:00]  Especially back when we were going to school.  Now, I'm sure they're a little more open to all that stuff and they're growing up a lot  faster.  But back in the day, these girls had no clue and they just thought it was safe to be kind  of naked in front of the gym teacher.  Yeah.  Imagine what that gym teacher was thinking.  And she's just making believe she has to do something in the locker room and oh, I'm  going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  Gym teacher walks in.  I got to get the girls out to the class. 
[00:48:30]  Suit up.  Girl, suit up.  I...  And in my school...  Just completely aroused.  In my school too, for some odd reason, the gym teacher's office was in the locker room.  In the locker room.  What the hell was that about? 
[00:49:00]  And it was kind of like a booth with like windows.  Yeah.  So she's sitting there on the phone making believe she's getting ready for the big game  or ordering more dodge balls, whatever the hell they did.  Picture your cubicle at work in a strip club.  That's where they work.  I got a, I got a phone call.  Let me make...  I'm having trouble with my whistles. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, we need...  I'm going to eat another gross of dodge balls.  Some field hockey shin pads.  You girls dry off well.  You don't want to get athletes for...  The office right in the locker room. 
[00:50:00]  I swear to God.  Oh, I never even...  I totally just...  You totally made me remember that.  That is the funniest thing I've heard in weeks.  And I told you the story.  I've mentioned the high school.  I better not.  But it's long gone because they finally remodeled.  But I was one of those...  I helped out the coach.  Coach.  I forgot.  We had a little title.  Like we were coaches.  Uh-oh.  Helpers, whatever.  I don't know what the hell it was. 
[00:50:30]  Wow.  But we had access to his office, which was right next to the women's locker room.  His office was not in the locker room like the girls was.  The girl teacher and coach.  And we noticed this cork board that had all the schedules and stuff.  And one day, I don't know, maybe it was passed down from generation to generation, but someone  just knew to close the door, lock it, and remove the cork board. 
[00:51:00]  And there was a fine, fine hole that went right through.  A little key hole.  Right through, not just a wall.  Like it was those blocks.  Cinder blocks.  Cinder blocks.  Thank you.  This hole went all the way through the cinder block.  Someone worked very hard.  And I guess I finally was invited into the inner circle.  And I was like, hey, you want to see something?  Like, yeah, whatever.  We're just sitting around talking about the Knicks or something dumb because we're all  obsessed with basketball.  And one kid's like, you want to see something?  Like, what? 
[00:51:30]  He goes, oh, trust me on this.  So they locked the door.  And they removed the cork board.  And there's a hole.  And he waited as the period is ending.  Yeah.  And all the girls file into the locker room.  Removed the cork board.  And it was like.  Wasn't covered by a poster of Rita Hayworth.  And I hate to say this because I know a lot of people who went to high school listen  to this show.  They chatter.  I saw most.  We're watching you.  I saw most of the girls that I graduated with naked. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, what a thrill.  Naked.  That was about the biggest thrill you could possibly have was the thought that you were  going to see them naked.  It was actually the thought when I would watch the girls come out of the locker room, the  thought that they were just naked was enough to, like, get you all worked up.  Sure.  That was like, oh.  And then you'd be next to the locker room, the girls' locker room, and think, right behind  this wall, it's just a little wall, is just paradise. 
[00:52:30]  Nice.  There it is.  And it's what they call sanity that kept you from just running in there.  Because there was, we talked yesterday about the over-the-top guy, guy that didn't know  how far to push it.  Yeah.  There was always a kid every year or so that would just run into the girls' locker room.  It just couldn't take it anymore.  I can't take it.  I got to see this.  His little perf switch went off.  Oh, and the news would spread through the school. 
[00:53:00]  He'd be in trouble.  It was just, yeah, his little perf switch went off.  And he had, I got to get in there.  It's just tempting you.  Yeah.  It tasks me.  It says it right on the door.  Girls' locker room.  It says, nude girls are in here.  Right.  I'm, hormones are pumping.  I'm going through a time of my life where I can't keep this thing in one spot.  And there's a door, there's a sign on it that might as well just say, all of your nude  girl dreams right here. 
[00:53:30]  It doesn't even have a locking knob on it.  You didn't know how.  You're pushing it open.  You didn't know how.  What the hell was going on down below?  Oh.  You're just trying to keep it under control.  I got to get in there.  Right.  It's like Regis.  I got to get in there, Kelvin.  There's nude girls.  The worst would be if you time it wrong and you run in while they're still dressed.  So you're thrown out of high school and you saw nothing.  And they just turn around fully clothed going, what is this idiot doing?  You really had a guy that would just run in there? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, every year.  So there was some guy that would just lose his mind and have to run in, usually with  something like a bandana around his face or something.  But everyone knew who everyone was.  Yeah.  So you get busted.  I worked out at a gym that I got to keep this on the QT.  A couple of people.  And there was a cork board, another cork board.  Those cork boards.  Like the yoga class schedule and the spinning schedule and, you know, massages when you 
[00:54:30]  could get a massage.  Nice gym.  And I discovered, because one day I'm just looking at the schedules and I just kind of  take a little glance to the left and I'm like, oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Perfect shot at the mirror in the girls' locker room that bounced off to the nudity.  And I would just stand there in between sets like, make him believe I'm looking at the  yoga. 
[00:55:00]  Boy, he sure is interested in that yoga schedule.  Oh, and I couldn't believe that no one discovered this.  And it wasn't, you didn't, you didn't have to look like a creep.  You were just looking and just kind of looked over to your left and boom, mirror, boom.  And you would just wait for the hot chick to be done with her workout and you would, time  to check the yoga schedule, hoping, hoping, hoping.  And it was like fishing.  I'll tell you who else knew it.  The person who wrote the yoga schedule.  Who else would put that faggoty nonsense on the wall? 
[00:55:30]  You occasionally get that in bathrooms or bars or something like that.  Yeah.  Perfect timing.  You're walking by, the door flings open.  You could look in the mirror.  There's a girl coming out of the stall.  You don't really see anything, but you're like, hey, just got a little view into the  inner sanctum.  All right.  Anyway, the female gym teacher bit is beyond hilarious.  Why they put her office, that's great.  I swear to God.  Brought that up.  I know.  I remember it.  Oh, it was in yours too?  Yeah.  The office was in the locker room? 
[00:56:00]  The office was in it.  It was a way to save space.  I don't know what that was about.  There were a couple of times after school hours, if I was in the school for any reason  whatsoever, I don't even know why I'd be in there, but no one was in there.  Me and a couple of friends would go into the girl's locker room just to look around.  And that was like.  And see what it was like.  It's like, yeah.  That would get your mind going.  Go up to the bench.  Find out whose locker it is.  Oh, yeah, I know this chick.  Oh, wow.  Tomorrow she'll be naked right in front of this locker. 
[00:56:30]  Like a dog.  Can you do the dyke gym teacher?  All the clueless young teenage girls.  Yeah, my girls should be coming in soon.  They've been out playing field hockey.  We just need another order.  What are we looking for?  We need some uniforms.  And you got to.  The team.  And you got to order the giant ball that no one knows why.  Yeah, we need the big round ball that they lay on and roll around on their little bellies. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  Oh, here they come.  Hold on.  All right, girls.  Shower time.  I'll be a.  Oh, my gosh.  Get a.  Get undressed, girls.  That's it.  Get clean.  That's what I taught you in health class because I'm also the health teacher.  Oh, God. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, God.  They're beautiful.  Ladies.  Make sure you watch your guests.  Watch right there.  Are the schools that clueless?  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  Put the gym teacher's office right there.  It'll keep it all convenient.  They can talk with the girls.  I bet you that's how the dykey gym teachers chose their job. 
[00:58:00]  They probably went from school to school and went, wait.  Wait a minute.  Where's the office?  Oh, we decided to conserve space.  And your office is going to be in the women's locker room.  Okay.  Don't care about the pay.  Whatever.  I'll be in.  What time do I start?  Now?  When do the naked girls come in?  Where's my whistle?  It's wonderful.  Your office is right off of the teacher's lounge thing.  Goodbye. 
[00:58:30]  See you later.  This is the worst of all we had in the serious XM.  XM, coming up, part two.  We're talking about dangerous gym stories and the lesbian gym teacher.  We're not done yet.  Gym class and what it will do to you when we get back.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus on Sirius XM.  Sam, part two about gym class stories and the lesbian gym teacher.  Well, E-Rock, guys like me and you were fine in gym class because lesbians aren't attracted 
[00:59:00]  to young men.  They would be attracted to young women.  Not all lesbians, of course, but lesbian gym teachers.  We were sort of envious by the fact that they could stand in the girls' locker room and  watch them shower and lather and then change.  Yes, and touch themselves.  It's gym teachers right here on the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the worst, is the worst Opie and Anthony virus.  Sirius XM.  All right, girls, good work out.  Good work out, ladies.  Time to shower off. 
[00:59:30]  Hit the showers.  Come on, girls.  Come on.  Come on, girls.  Shower off.  That's it.  Get those uniforms off.  Debbie, pick up my whistle.  Oh, God.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  He continued through the break. 
[01:00:00]  Anthony's new bit.  We were all clueless when we were in school.  We had no idea.  And then you grow up, you get a little knowledge out in this fine world of ours, and you go,  what the F was going on in school with the dyke gym teacher?  She was a little manly, that's all.  But she was, didn't know she was, you know, doing that with other women.  They were all called Miz.  Miz. 
[01:00:30]  Miz.  The first ones to be called Miz.  Miz.  They're in their 40s called Miz.  Well, we're taking your dyke gym teacher stories.  Diana from California, what's up?  Hey, it's me again.  How are you guys?  Like, we're supposed to know who you are.  It's Diana from California.  I'm just shaving or talking shit or shooting shit while you're shaving your quits.  And she curses a lot.  I apologize.  I forgot you guys were on this.  But when I was in middle school. 
[01:01:00]  Just let it go, whatever.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Diana.  When I was in middle school, we all, we knew our teacher was, we didn't know what she was,  but we knew we didn't want to be naked in front of her.  She, we get checked, you get checked for scoliosis when you're a certain age.  Oh, that gag, by the way.  Yeah, let's get into that a little bit.  The physicals.  And we talked about it for weeks beforehand because we didn't, we're like, are you really  going to do it because you had to take your shirt off in front of her and she got you in  your bra.  So it was like a, we were all, it was weird.  We didn't know, we weren't, we didn't know what gay was, but we knew what gay was. 
[01:01:30]  Scoliosis test today, girls.  But, but we just had him yesterday.  Oh, not a scoliosis test.  Could happen in a day.  You never know.  The test was flawed.  We got to do it again.  Yeah, the result's a little flawed.  So line up on the line here and take your shirts off, girls.  Line, line up on the, ladies.  Scoliosis test all week. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, dropped my whistle.  And the best part about that too.  Hearing test, girls.  Hearing test.  Take off your shirts.  Why do we have to, don't, don't talk back.  Hearing test.  You got to take your shirt off.  She was always the favorite teacher too, because she had some, she had a reason to be a really  good teacher.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Oh yeah.  To get old, just a little bit closer.  She wanted to keep her job.  Dude.  Now that I think about it, you know, when we were growing up, like school was a pedophile's  dream.  Of course.  How many times where the kids are, how many times was there an excuse to be the old age  home?  That's just dawning on you.  I'm a pedophile, pedophile working in an old age home.  This place sucks.  Yeah.  But back then they got away with murders.  What I'm getting at every day.  I mean, every day we're handed just a story after story, another kid and a teacher or whatever.  Some dumb pedophile thing happening. 
[01:03:00]  Right.  Yeah.  We had no clue when we were in school and our parents for the most part had no clue.  They thought the pedophiles were the creeps with the candy and the slow moving car past  the stupid school.  No, those are pedophile hacks.  Yeah.  They were in our schools and there was always an excuse to get the kids semi-naked.  Was there, Opie?  Why don't you tell us that?  What excuse?  What excuse?  The cough test for guys?  What was that about?  Why did they have to check that in school?  Oh, that was to check for a hernia or something? 
[01:03:30]  But why did they have to do that?  Why couldn't you have it with your family doctor?  You did.  What?  It's like, as far as I remember, you did.  Yeah, you did.  No, no, but then they would do it at school.  Thank you.  You're absolutely right.  They would line up.  I mean, you can joke all you want, but I'm getting into some real crap here.  Like, we all lined up one after another, like, getting the cough test on.  I'm like, what's that about?  A hundred boys lining up in elementary school in front of a creepy old man who would take  you behind this white little curtain they'd put up, take his hand, grab your junk underneath 
[01:04:00]  and say, cough.  Checking for hernias.  And here's the deal.  It was always an older, creepier guy.  And the school, once again, assuming that's the safe way to go instead of maybe a young  female doctor or whatever.  It was like, no, obviously a guy wouldn't get, obviously a guy wouldn't be turned on  by this.  An old guy that's never been married and been in the school district for four decades.  He's our best guy when it comes to doing this to kids. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  Are you kidding me?  He doesn't even get paid.  He volunteers.  And then the scoli, whatever test.  Scoliosis.  Scoliosis test.  Oh, he's like, why?  Why in school?  Can't tell if you're, yeah, your pediatrician hasn't been able to tell if your back looks  like a pretzel.  Right.  But this guy, yeah, some creep in school is going to know when you take your shirts  off, everyone's shirt off.  There was always an excuse to be semi-nude in school.  For whatever reason.  What is this whole thing about the check, the hernia check with the hand? 
[01:05:00]  It's something to do with the cough.  Like they feel something that's not right.  Feel some kind of, they would grab underneath and just about where, um, where the midground  is, you know, the, uh, tint.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  I understand where, but they would use the hand?  Yeah.  A hand.  No, not see in my school.  He said that there's more nerve endings in the mouth and that was more helpful for the  test.  And I thought that was standard.  Ah, wow.  And then he made me test him, which I thought was inappropriate because I'm not a doctor. 
[01:05:30]  All right, let's go to Chicago.  It was funny.  At the end of the test, he would cough and gag a little.  Let's not forget, we are live in Chicago now.  They adjusted our hours.  Not at that age.  Talking right over you.  I'm sorry.  Um, let's say hi to Robert listening on WCKG Live.  Hey, yeah, Pat.  What's up, uh, Robert?  Hey, I got a great story for you about, um, gym teacher.  Uh, sisters that were older than me, they all had the same gym teacher in high school.  And she wanted to make sure that everybody washed in the shower instead of just kind 
[01:06:00]  of, you know, so in order to make sure that they, for sure, they got wet in the shower,  as they were filing out, she would be standing there.  And with her finger, she would run between, you know, uh, their breasts.  All right.  You're such a liar.  We make sure that they were wet.  I swear to God.  Why couldn't she just do it with, uh, with their arms to, to make sure no one's going  to say anything?  Or just look and see if there's a glistening of liquid.  Because as soon as the touching happens, of course, somebody's going to be onto something. 
[01:06:30]  No, no, this is honest to goodness.  I mean, I'm 40.  My sister's in their mid-50s.  Uh, lie detector's going off on the phone?  Yeah, I hear that.  You heard that?  Oh, wait, he said he's 40, though, and his sister's in the mid-50s.  You know something?  I wouldn't doubt it.  Back then, maybe.  Back then.  Right between the you-know-what, though?  Come on.  Yeah, right in the cleavage.  They, they, she would take a little, a little, like, like whipped cream off a cake and put  her finger in her mouth. 
[01:07:00]  I remember the gym teacher would be annoyed if you didn't take a shower after gym class.  And you know what?  Oh, they-  Guess what?  Guess what?  Gym teacher?  Some of us didn't develop yet.  I would never take a shower in gym class because, first of all, I didn't work up a sweat.  I didn't do anything in gym.  I stood around like an idiot.  You know how-  And why the hell am I going to get naked at school?  In front of your-  In front of your-  Yeah.  I got to do that.  And guess what?  Some of us developed a little later.  I was one of those kids.  I'm not going to, I'm not going to, you know, be naked in a men's locker room as a junior 
[01:07:30]  high school kid with the kid that already has a mustache and everything else is happening  on him.  70s porno mustache.  I look like an infant.  I'm like, you know, that was cruel.  I hope he went to school with John Holmes, just walking around with a big mustache.  Oh, it's kind of a hack bit, but we all had that kid that, you know, had the five o'clock  shadow by six period.  Yeah.  And he was shaving already, and you're still waiting for your first whisker, praying every  night for that one little whisker, knowing that the process has begun. 
[01:08:00]  Certain areas just-  A plucked chicken.  Oh, I was, I was like a mission impossible dude in the locker room.  I made, I made sure that I wasn't naked in front of anybody.  No one saw anything.  No.  No.  I'd be standing on the line and everybody's on with their shorts and sneakers on, and I'd  be there with jeans and my shoes just getting yelled at and berated by a gym teacher that,  you know, like we said before, wanted to be something else. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Where's your uniform?  Uniform, it's shorts and a t-shirt with the stupid school logo on it.  That stinks because it's been in my locker for six months.  Stupid school logo.  We haven't won a championship since 1977.  Yeah.  We all see the banner up there.  Yeah.  You think, like, I want to put on the uniform.  Have some pride.  Have some pride.  That's the Captain Hook uniform.  The only championship we had in our gym was for badminton, 1977. 
[01:09:00]  Badminton.  Some dumb sport.  Greg in Bayside, what's up?  Yeah.  Quick question for you guys.  And it proves that there's got to be those pedophiles back when we were going to school.  How many little kids actually walked away from those tests with hernias?  Yeah, I remember when I was lifting vaults when I was seven years old.  I was in the vault and anvil business.  How many kids are doing heavy lifting back then?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How many 13-year-olds were power lifting? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, Doc, I tell you.  I just went to pick up the Tonka truck and, ah, shooting pain.  I remember they lined us up in our frickin' underwear and they had us do all these physical tests and they did the scoliosis.  It was like the induction.  It was like you were going off to the NOM.  What the hell were they doing to these kids?  They had an inside society, man.  They all figured it out a long time ago.  We were really raised in a screwy time. 
[01:10:00]  There was so much trust in everybody.  Right.  You know, they'd send us off to school and just, whatever happens, and you couldn't come home.  Hey, I went to school today.  Oh, how was your day?  Well, I had to pull my pants down.  Like, if that happened today.  Hey, how was your day in school?  Well, I pulled my pants down in front of an old guy.  Woo!  Woo!  All right, come out of the building.  Put your hands in the air.  Get the creepy old guy out here.  He's under arrest, as are everyone in the school over the age of 16. 
[01:10:30]  Like, today, back then, it was like, how was school?  I pulled my pants down for an old man, and I coughed.  Oh, I did that when I was a kid.  It was great.  Ah, it's a hernia test.  No big deal.  All right, go ahead.  Right.  But he, ah, get out, mow the lawn.  What?  What?  In this day and age, you don't get away with anything.  And they would come up with, like, dumb things during gym class just to get you all horned up.  Horned up.  They'd get you horned up, and then you've got to go into a locker room, and then you've got gym teachers making sure you're washing properly. 
[01:11:00]  What the hell was going on?  Scraping you with their fingers.  Climbing the rope in gym class.  The only reason to do that was to get you horned up.  Yeah.  For what?  I don't know.  Maybe to get a, maybe the gym teacher was looking for the weak ones.  The ones that were ready.  Let's go to Dan in Jersey.  Dan, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Dude, I got a story for you guys.  All right.  Middle school, I'm dating this chick.  Yeah.  They did the whole physical thing. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  The curtain opens up.  My girlfriend's father.  Oh.  Hmm.  That's awkward.  It was very weird.  Hey, now you both got something to talk about at dinner, huh, Pop?  Especially if he leaned over and smelled her breath.  Father goes, I know that breath.  Hey, wait a minute.  Well, that wouldn't work really, now would it?  No.  I get a minus for that one. 
[01:12:00]  Minus.  So your girlfriend's father gave the hernia test?  Yeah.  He actually grabbed my junk.  Oh, my God.  Too much.  Did he ever do it like when you were just sitting there on the couch and she left to get popcorn?  Watching TV.  Time for another test.  All right.  Oh, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, you know what?  We want to hear more from the ladies.  Marissa in Boston, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hi.  I'm calling about the scoliosis test, actually. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  That was the first thing I thought of.  And by the way, our female lesbian gym teacher did have her office in the locker room.  See?  Yeah.  Just in case you thought we were making this up.  Yep.  And it was all glass, just like you said.  Yeah, big glass office.  Wait, does this sound familiar?  This is my new favorite thing.  All right, girls.  Come on out.  Just stand in front of my office here.  Yeah, the glass office, right?  That's uncanny.  Going to make sure everybody's practicing good hygiene. 
[01:13:00]  Want to make sure you're shaving your armpits.  Shirts and bras off.  Come on.  Shirts and bras.  I can't.  Stand there, girls.  Stand.  I got to go lay down.  Like trying to whistle after eating a cracker. 
[01:13:30]  I'm dizzy.  So this is uncanny, right, Marissa?  Yeah, you know, and it's funny because, like you said, girls at that age, we didn't even think of stuff like that until...  ...and we're wondering why we had to do it in our underwear, when they were just looking at our back.  Everything in your underwear.  Everything was in your underwear.  Everything in your goddamn underwear back then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, let's get it up, guys.  Thank you. 
[01:14:00]  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on SiriusXM.  The virus.  Sam, coming up after the break.  Bob Kelly's in studio, and you know what made him the man he is today?  What's that?  His fucked up childhood.  Right.  And the man he is today is not much of a man at all.  He molests you.  It's Bob Kelly and his weird...  ...running away childhood when we get back.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on the virus, SiriusXM.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hi, by the way. 
[01:14:30]  I'm E-Rock, E's primetime Sam Roberts, and happy Valentine's Day.  Yes, I just got this card, E-Rock, this Valentine's Day card.  Yeah.  And it says that Bob Kelly was in the studio, and he was talking about running away.  That's weird, because my card, it says, happy birthday, signed Greg Brady.  Huh.  Well, we'll stick with my card, I guess.  Bob Kelly was in studio talking about stories of dealing with his stepdad and all the times  that young Bob would run away from home.  Yeah, Bob did not have the ideal childhood growing up in the mean streets of Massachusetts. 
[01:15:00]  It led all of you to thinking that you should call in and give us your runaway stories, too.  And we went with it, because we're good people.  It's runaway stories right here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the worst, is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The virus, SiriusXM.  No one cares as much for their stepkids as they do for their real kids.  Yeah, I know that.  It just doesn't fucking happen.  I know.  Oh, you know?  I got punched in the face for five years.  You know personally?  Oh, yeah.  I was never a stepkid, so I don't know. 
[01:15:30]  What years were you a stepkid?  From, uh...  17 to 22.  Oh.  30 to 35.  I was a stepkid, but that's like to Sal when I was already older.  I mean, like, as a kid, though, like, during those formative years, you're just fucked if  you're a stepkid.  Yeah, he, uh, yeah, my mother married Billy, Billy, just a six foot four, parted his hair  to the side.  Really?  Oh, he'd throw me down a nice flight of stairs.  And he would, like, fucking beat you? 
[01:16:00]  Uh, just call you stupid, smack you in the back of the head, and then he'd go, he used  to go make me wash his spokes on his, uh, money collar with T-tops.  With your tongue?  Wait, you lived with your...  Wash my spokes.  You lived with your mother for a while?  Yeah, I lived with my...  Your birth mother?  Oh, yeah.  I thought you didn't live with either parent.  No, no, no.  No, he lived with that, that, he's the guy who kind of set me off.  He, she, she, she didn't want to marry him, because he was a lunatic, but then she married  him.  And, uh...  Because she needed stability, was it one of those?  Oh, she, yeah, she lived, we lived with my Irish Catholic family, like 13 of us in 
[01:16:30]  a two-bedroom, so it was, it was just creepy.  This is the start of every horrific movie, where it was the loving family, something happens  to the freaking husband, and then she goes out and gets a man because she needs the stability  and someone to raise the boys, and then that guy becomes the complete asshole.  Right.  And beats the shit out of the kids.  But they're always, the guy was nice, though, at the beginning.  He was...  He was nice.  Oh, I can't, I remember we, we, they got married.  How old were you again?  I'm sorry.  I had to be in first grade.  Kinder, kindergarten.  So six to ten, six to eleven, around there? 
[01:17:00]  Okay.  Yeah, five, five to six.  Five to ten?  All right.  Young boy, you shouldn't see things like that.  I went from sleeping on the floor to having my own bedroom.  That boy Bobby's got a heart as big as all outside.  Don't you dare hurt that boy.  Get the fuck out!  Get the fuck out of my house!  I'm fixing to kill you, Bobby.  Reckon I'm going to take this blade and cut your head clean off. 
[01:17:30]  Why don't you throw him down the stairs a few times first?  I'd like to watch it.  Oh, fucking Bobby is getting beaten.  That's awful.  Now go down and hug him a little bit and then throw him down the stairs again.  All right, so you went from having no room to having your own room.  Mommy's got a new man in her life.  I remember walking to my bedroom.  I had a toy box.  He filled it with toys because he had a lot of cash. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Filled it with toys.  My own bed.  I remember I had a chandelier like a little, like a, well it wasn't a chandelier.  It was like a light fixture and I've never seen a light fixture before because like my  grandmother's house, it was just the light bulb.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I had a little side room with my own TV and a bean bag.  That sounds nice.  It was, you don't understand how great it was.  It was unbelievable.  And then I remember being on my little bean bag, I don't know how long, it must have been  months later.  After he set you up nice, new room, new toys, everything's good. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, toys.  A desk, had a desk with all little, you know, school stuff in it, ready to go.  And then he set me up, I was sleeping on my bean bag watching TV.  I fell asleep and I remember waking up and I, you know, I was kind of just woke up from  a nap.  This was my new life.  Five years old.  Yeah, I had my own little room and I was, I think I was in Fiti pajamas.  No, no, I think I was in, I actually had this shirt that said slugger.  Oh, you're a little slugger.  It had a baseball and it said slugger. 
[01:19:00]  Did your pajamas have a little bloody hatch in the back?  And it wasn't an SLU at the beginning of that shirt.  And I remember, I remember walking out and I heard a noise in the kitchen and I thought  it was a TV, I walk out, my sister's crying and I've never seen anybody cry up till this  point.  You know what I mean?  Oh, shit.  Sister's crying.  My mother, I walk in right when he punches her in the gut. 
[01:19:30]  What?  Yeah, I just punched her right in the gut.  I punched my mom.  Wow.  Then my sister went to grab the phone and he hit her and like ripped the phone up, but  it was kind of around her neck.  So she fell on the ground.  And then my mom, and I'm, I'm in, I'm in shock.  And then my mom grabbed us all into the room, shut my sister's door and he was banging on  the, this guy was six, four, big, big dude.  He's banging on the door.  And then, uh, I remember what your fucking mom do wrong. 
[01:20:00]  Holy shit.  I remember I was holding the door, trying to hold it back.  Cause you were the, the, I was, uh, yeah, I was the guy, the little man of the family,  right.  He's trying to hold the door.  I was slugger.  Oh, and, uh, I remember he, he kicked the door and I went flying, smashed me against the  wall.  So ever since then you said, I'm going to be a fat fuck so that if this ever happens  again, I'll wait. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  All right.  Kicks down the door.  Then what?  This is what's weird is I remember that this is the first time I've ever felt fear.  And I, I pussied out and I regret it to this day.  Well, of course you're pussied out.  You're fine.  No, but I'm in a toy box full of toys.  I mean, come on.  He, I slammed me against the door and I hit the wall and I pretended to be hurt more than  I was.  Oh, you know what I mean? 
[01:21:00]  Tactic.  I pretended to be like dazed.  Yeah.  And it was self-preservation.  You were like playing possum.  You were playing possum instead of being a tiger.  Playing dead.  He was playing dead.  Hoping the big bear would smell him and then walk away.  That's the instinct.  And then, and then, uh, five years later, I chased him around the house with a knife and a  hatchet, but, but it wasn't to kill him.  It was the guy who had bread and butter and Bob was hungry.  So you pretended you were more hurt than you actually were?  Oh yeah, dude.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I hurt my knee, man.  Hold my hand, man. 
[01:21:30]  Wait, there's two.  Only back then.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  So dude, you chased him with a knife.  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to back up though.  So what did he do to you guys after you got in the room and you're like playing like you're  hurt and stuff?  I don't, he came in, he said one of those things you say, I don't know, like, you know,  shut the fuck up.  That type of shit.  You know, like, fuck you.  And like, kind of like, if you didn't do this, then this wouldn't have fucking happened. 
[01:22:00]  What was his problem?  Yeah.  Well, like dude, just an anger issue or dude, he was, he, I think this is what I don't  think he wanted kids.  I wanted, my mom was hot.  My mom was a hot mom.  I think he wanted my mom, but he didn't want the kids.  Hang on one second.  Yeah.  I just said my mom's hot.  Who went, hmm?  Who didn't?  Exactly.  And I think he wanted, he didn't want to deal with us, but to get, my mom blew him off for 
[01:22:30]  a lot.  It was like, screw you, screw you, screw you.  And then he started treating us nice.  I mean, this guy is such a scumbag.  Like, when my mom finally said, fuck you, I'm out of here.  And he had money too.  He bought us Atari, but it was when Atari first came out.  Yeah.  And we were in sixth grade.  So it's like, he came, she came home one night and we were all sitting around, me, my  sister and him playing Atari like best friends.  It totally worked.  It totally worked.  We, we fucking were like, Mike, maybe you shouldn't divorce him. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Maybe you should work things out.  I mean, he's a fucking scumbag.  It worked, you guys.  Oh, dude, he was a, what happened to him?  He's, I have no idea, dude.  I know he, I saw him one time.  He's dead.  Years later.  Yeah.  I was working at Grossman's Bargain Outlet and I seen, I seen, I don't know if it was  him.  I'm 99% sure it was him.  And I saw him.  And this is when I was, uh, you know, I think I was like 22 or 20 and I saw him and  I had to go upstairs and like leave the floor cause I was going to fucking, I was going 
[01:23:30]  to get beat up by him again.  Like, ah, nah, he was like, yeah, you go to be a tough guy and he pushes you on the  floor and you make believe you're hurt again more than you are.  Push you over a carpet.  Punches me in the, and then he goes, beat, he beats the shit out of my mom.  Just finds out where your mom lives and beats her up again.  I told you to keep this kid in check.  So then it drastically changed after that and he started beating you guys?  Dude, this guy would, I remember coming home late.  I was happy that I got Miss Julian for second grade.  Who wouldn't be?  You know, at the end of the year, you got, you got, you got, you got told who your teacher's 
[01:24:00]  going to be, who your teacher's going to be.  And it was either really good news or like, oh fuck.  Right.  A summer of, oh fuck.  Exactly.  You know that you're going in, Miss Irving, you're fucked.  I got Miss Julian and, uh, she, she was, uh, it was great.  I was, I was actually skipping home.  I got Miss Julian.  She played the taste game?  Huh?  No.  I wish she did.  Mr. Washington sure did.  Put chopped meat, lettuce and tomato in there and say, eat the taco. 
[01:24:30]  Nice.  We're going to paint my pussy today.  Be wonderful.  Yeah, she, I, I got home late and I got in and I went, I don't know if I called him dad.  I was like, Hey, uh, I got Miss Julian.  And he goes, you are fucking late.  I was supposed to be out of here 20 minutes ago.  And he threw me down a flight of stairs.  And how old, you were six, seven? 
[01:25:00]  I was in second grade.  Second.  So you're 16.  Now you're up to about.  I was right.  I was actually 15.  I was 15.  I get it, Jim.  He's stupid.  He's as dumb as a day is long.  Wow.  So he tossed you down the fucking stairs.  Oh yeah.  Nice hot one down the stairs.  And, uh, and your mom just looked the other way.  You know what, dude?  I don't know.  I don't remember.  I remember telling her shit, but I remember this is, this is fucked.  I remember I ran away.  Remember when you run away? 
[01:25:30]  Good job.  Where are you going?  You, yeah, it's like, dude, you run to the end of the yard and then realize it's a scary  place.  I ran over the fence.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Dude, you run away.  You got such good.  I'm running away.  I'm gone.  And then you get like two blocks away and you've never been there.  You look around, it's just strange.  You feel like a, like a mouse that saw humans for the first time.  They saw the, and the weather's different two blocks away.  Like cars are bigger.  There's more noise. 
[01:26:00]  Nothing familiar.  I remember standing at the bus stop at a bus stop.  I just stopped at a bus stop crying, just crying.  And this hot chick was like, Hey, blah, blah, blah.  You all right?  And I was like, I ran away.  And she was like, where do you live?  I'll take you home.  I was like, okay.  I just wanted to go home.  And I remember, you know, you run away because you want your parents to be like, where the  fuck were you?  And I got home.  My mother opens the door.  You have, I don't think I ran away long enough. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  You know, there's a, you have to make sure you have to be away for at least a couple hours  for her to panic.  Cause if you come back 10 minutes later, she's like, Hey, what's up?  Yeah.  Where'd you go?  You just kind of jump in.  Tim H got it figured out in Columbus.  He writes, uh, he ran away, but ran out of breath at the end of the driveway and collapsed.  He was a good looking kid.  He was a good looking kid.  Speaking of which, I was at the, uh, the cellar last, uh, weekend with the Philly crew and  you know, all those, uh, headshots, you know, as you're going downstairs. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  There's one of you.  It's unrecognizable.  It's the same person.  I was gorgeous.  Bob was a fucking handsome pussy guy.  I was, I was, I was a full head of hair, no goatee.  Gorgeous.  I, I, safe to say, full lips, safe to say 40 pounds lighter, 40, 40, 40, he was, that  was fucking two or a third Bob's ago.  I was one 85 in that photo.  He's Bob on Jupiter now.  No offense, Bob.  I'm teasing you.  Of course.  I knew Bob back then.  Well, at least I was good looking once in my life, Norton. 
[01:27:30]  Were you?  You lost a bunch of weight and you're still you.  Exactly.  So I learned to get pussy as a mess.  You, we, do we have a, it doesn't matter because you have a girl now.  I'm saying you'd be in bad shape if you were still single.  No, I wouldn't.  Shut up.  Excuse me.  Come on.  All right.  We got a, we got a song for Bob.  We got a song for Bob.  He said, shut up.  Bob, little number.  Bob, just for you today.  Listen, uh, listen closely.  Is it going to make me cry?  My name is Luca.  Ah.  I live on the second floor. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  I talk when the game is on.  I don't know.  Yes, I think you've seen me before.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight.  Yeah.  Just don't ask me what it was.  Stop talking.  I don't ask me what it was.  Yeah.  I think it's because I'm clumsy. 
[01:28:30]  I try not to talk to you.  Oh, oh, mother fucker.  Maybe it's because I'm crazy.  I try not to act proud.  Only hit.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, man.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Please, just shut up.  You just don't like it.  You lie.  You're a fucking liar.  Shut up.  You need to shut the fuck up. 
[01:29:00]  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  No fucking way.  Shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  You fucking moron.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  Yes, I think I will.  Shut up and sit down, you big bald fuck.  What do you mean?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[01:29:30]  Shut up.  Hey, Tom, you are a disgusting somebody.  Get your goddamn mouth.  Now joke yourself.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I'm standing up to yourself.  Oh, fuck, it's an idiot.  Just don't ask me.  Oh, fuck, it's an idiot.  Just don't ask me how I am.  I hate you.  I hate you. 
[01:30:00]  I hate you.  I hate you.  Yes, I think you've seen me before.  Is it ringing a bell?  Oh, but you guys are hitting so many buttons, it looks like you're launching the space shuttle.  Right down the steps they are.  We get it, you assholes.  A bunch of asses we are.  How many buttons did you just hit?  I don't know.  Hey, it's a sad day.  All right, well, here you go. 
[01:30:30]  My name is...  See, that makes it all better, Bob, right?  Well, I didn't finish the sad part.  Yeah.  When I left and I came back, my mom was crying, like, where are you?  Exactly what you want.  Oh, yeah.  When you run away.  And then when I got upstairs and she hugged me and said, I love you, and I went, I love  you, too.  No, I went, oh, mom, I love you, too.  And I was high, and everything was better.  You know what I mean?  Everything was better. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  And I was hot.  Wait, here we go.  Radio.  All right.  Hang on.  Can't end like that.  Let me get the proper button.  Hold on.  Is that the way it ended?  A nice one?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, that's nice.  Why don't we go to break?  Wait, no, no, no.  That's real nice, Bob.  No.  I'm hiding under the coffee table, happy that I finally got some love and attention in  second grade, going into second grade.  Yeah.  And I heard my mother on the phone talking to one of her girlfriends, and then she goes,  and then he comes back, and I told him I love you, and then he goes, oh, mom, 
[01:31:30]  I love you, too.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.  So she laughed at that.  You thought it was, like?  Hysterically.  And I remember.  Oh, and it was everything to you.  Oh, dude.  Oh, and just a fucking joke.  It was a...  Dude.  Oh, wait, wait, Bob.  Was it a joke or was she laughing like out of relief, like how cute it was? 
[01:32:00]  I, dude, at the time, maybe now.  You broke my trust, dude.  You broke my trust, dude.  Who knew that?  Come on, bitch.  You're a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I'm a fucking idiot.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Oh, is that horrible? 
[01:32:30]  Poor little Bob.  There you go.  Poor little Bob.  Wow, that really stuck out in your head, too.  Oh, I remember it to this day.  Yeah.  Oh, Mom, I love you.  And then he said, oh, Mom, I love you.  What a dope.  And then you went into foster homes after that?  No, then I snapped.  Then I started using drugs in sixth grade.  Yeah, you should have.  That guy went after me one day, and I pulled the knife out.  Nice.  And then a hatchet, and I went after him.  I was going to kill him, too.  I'm not even kidding. 
[01:33:00]  He stuck his hand.  My mother grabbed me.  He was like, go ahead, do it.  I didn't even think.  I just pulled the knife right down.  You were going to just kill him, right there.  I was going to gut him.  Sixth grade, I was going to gut him.  I was going to gut him.  You'd have been out already.  Huh?  You'd have been out already.  What did Mom say goodbye to you?  What'd you say?  Didn't your mom say goodbye to you, too?  You had to start living in other places?  What is that?  What are you doing with the spoon?  Yeah.  No, I went to jail.  I went to juvie jail. 
[01:33:30]  At what age?  At what cute little Bobby age?  Uh, 13.  Juicy lips.  13 juvie hall?  Wow.  Yeah, there's no gay sex in juvie.  Oh, please.  You're only in there for three months.  If you're sucking dick, you're gay.  You're getting out in a week.  I'm not saying you wanted to.  I'll suck your dick for cigarettes.  Dude, at 13, you got 100 boners a day, though.  Yep.  I'll tell you when you walk in, they refer to your mouth as the fuckery. 
[01:34:00]  You think black people knew what fuckery meant?  That's why you got full lips.  They're still swollen.  How do you know I have full lips?  Because you said, don't forget to talk about my full lips.  It was a callback.  Peter, Massachusetts.  What's up?  Oh, this story reminds me of when I was in third grade.  I got out of line.  My mom used to whack me with a whipple ball bat.  One day, she'd whack me.  I'm like, that's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm running away.  I run down the street, and I start hitchhiking. 
[01:34:30]  Like, I'm going to, you know, run away.  Frickin' neighbors call my mother.  Tell them I'm down the street hitchhiking.  And I see her car coming down the road.  She fucking says, get in.  Get home.  She just fucking beats me up some more with a whipple ball bat.  That's great.  Then she made you do the challenge.  Good job.  His mom had to do the challenge in their asses.  Let's take a quick break.  I think Peter's onto something.  We want your stories of running away as, like, a third grader.  Because it's just completely ridiculous. 
[01:35:00]  But in your mindset back then, you were convinced, I'm running away.  Yeah, it's done.  But you're, like, eight.  Like, what are you going to do?  But a block is, like, ten miles.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to get some of those stories, because it could be funny.  Like, then what finally hits you, like, oh, shit, I can't do this.  Fuck.  Yeah, I'm hungry.  I'm hungry, right.  I need clothes.  I need whatever.  I don't know.  The mistake you made was having that chick take you home instead of her place.  Yeah, really.  Oh, I wish.  What a goodie couches.  Scored.  I definitely relate to the guy that doesn't want the kids. 
[01:35:30]  Because my mother was going out with some guy, and he was, like, a lot younger than she was.  And he was just so demeaning to, especially me.  Like, my brother didn't give a shit, because he was already out.  Like, he didn't care.  He'd just leave and smoke pot.  My sister was the girl, and too young to really.  But me, I was just, like, constantly being fucking criticized by the guy. 
[01:36:00]  It was, like, everything I did.  Everything I did.  And then I was putting together a model of the visible V8.  It was a V8 engine, and it was like you could see through it, you know?  And the little lights lit up when the spark plugs happened.  And I happened to put the crankshaft in backwards.  So, I'm like, the pistons wouldn't line up.  And then I realized I had to start taking shit apart.  And he comes in, he goes, what happened?  I go, oh, I think I put the crankshaft in backwards.  And he goes, everything you do, you fuck up.  Jesus. 
[01:36:30]  He goes, everything you do, you just fuck it up.  And I'm just sitting there like, yeah, just fuck the model.  It's a model.  It's fucked.  But everything was like that.  Everything I did was all fucked up, not good enough.  Don't fuck yourself, you cocksucker, you fucker.  You motherfucker, literally.  Yeah, fuck him.  Fuck mine.  That could have been a much worse story, though.  That could have been when he pushed my face into the model and ruined my bottom.  He just gave you a little scalding.  No, it was all just, like, mental. 
[01:37:00]  It was all this mental abuse like that.  Like, I was into drawing at one point.  And I had a little wooden case with pencils and paper and stuff.  And I would draw things.  Usually, I would try to draw naked chicks.  You know, you got to kind of have talent for that.  So, I'm just drawing.  And he'd come by and look and go, that sucks.  Jesus.  That sucks.  I love this guy.  Oh, he was the worst.  Dennis.  Dennis was his name.  Oh, fuck yourself. 
[01:37:30]  I used to figure mine would make me go outside and do yard work.  And I'd pretend like a weed whacker.  Like, I wouldn't do it right.  And he'd come out and go, look, you got to do it this way.  And then he'd do it a little bit.  Couldn't do it then.  Give it back.  And then he'd fuck it up again.  And he'd go, just get the fuck out of here, you idiot.  And he'd just wind up doing it.  It was stupid.  He was like, good.  I didn't want to do it, you fucking idiot.  Who's the idiot now?  That was a douche.  Oh, I should have stabbed him.  Hey, we got some phone calls coming in.  This is the mind of, like, a seven-year-old.  Here we go.  John in Texas.  Go ahead.  Tell your story. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, man.  I don't know what it was, but I got fed up.  Had enough.  And I grabbed, you know, the old big brown paper sack you get the groceries for.  And I popped it full of clothes I could get out of my drawers.  I started out the house.  And, you know, without any hesitation, I got probably, as far as the mailbox, and the  bag just got too fucking heavy.  I came back to the house.  Oh, that's good.  And my mom and dad, my aunt and uncle, are sitting inside the house laughing, and they'd  locked the fucking door and wouldn't let me back in. 
[01:38:30]  Jesus.  That's what I want to hear, because everyone has the great idea of, I'm going to run away.  And then what caused you to turn around and go, oh, fuck, I'm stuck until I'm 14, 15.  Fucking Clarice Starling was better at running away than you could.  She carried a lamb.  I know.  You grabbed two hams and a butt cake.  Let's go to Cross Cross.  Hey, boys.  I was about, I was living over in Japan.  We were in the Air Force and everything.  And me and my sister, I was in the first grade. 
[01:39:00]  We took off, even grabbed my, you know, goofy-ass little stuffed animal, went down to  the park there, waited until, gosh, it must have been about 8, 9 o'clock at night.  We ended up, we just, you know, chickened out, went back to the house.  My parents were in bed asleep, didn't even know we were gone.  Thanks for sharing.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then he hung up.  All right.  Kind of.  All right.  I get what he meant, but he didn't really tell it with much gusto. 
[01:39:30]  Gusto.  Gusto.  Let's go to Tom in Philly.  Tom.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up?  I was about five years old.  I ran away from home, but I wasn't allowed to cross the street, so I just ran around the  block.  Hoping a bridge was built.  We got Doug in Los Angeles.  Doug.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Okay.  When I was either 7 or 8, my mom caught me playing doctor with this girl down the street.  So she grounds me, and I was so upset at this that I ended up, I decided to run away. 
[01:40:00]  I threw a bunch of toys into a pillowcase, and I opened my window, and I was going to  run away just going out through the window, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.  So I'm sitting there on the windowsill for about 45 minutes until she finally poked her  head into my bedroom to see what I was doing, because I just had to sit there until the last  second when she was going to open the door, and then I was going to jump out the window.  I wish that happened in the 20th floor. 
[01:40:30]  I know what he's saying, though.  I did that.  You don't want to kill you.  I tried to fake suicide.  I hung out a window for around an hour, and they never came up.  I was like, and I'm crying, and then I'm waiting for them to try to knock on the door  and get in.  I put the bureau up against the door so they could get in, so they wanted to break in.  What are you doing?  And then I was going to pretend to jump, and they finally did come up.  But the bureau opened too quick, so they just went there, and they're like, what are you 
[01:41:00]  doing, dummy?  Are you really?  Dummy.  I think my father went, it's a second floor window.  What, are you going to break an elbow?  You're not going to kill yourself.  Well, no, this is the first floor.  I wanted them to see me as I was leaving, but I couldn't commit to the running away.  All right.  You wanted them to stop you and rescue you.  Yeah.  Let's go to David and Dallas.  A couple more of these.  David?  Yeah.  I don't know why I got eight years old.  I got as far as the neighbor's garage.  All right.  Hold on.  What?  I ran away.  I was about eight years old. 
[01:41:30]  I got as far as the neighbor's garage.  Fell asleep in there.  There's five of us in my family.  Nobody knew I was fucking gone.  All right.  Here's the kicker.  Here's the kicker.  I brought my dog with me.  It wasn't a fucking chihuahua.  It was a goddamn Great Dane.  And they didn't know either one of us were gone.  Probably happy.  They probably were calling the dog.  Come here, boy.  They probably were a while ago.  They probably took the dog eight and eight and left.  I don't know.  But, you know, that's my life as the youngest of five.  There you go.  Thanks, David. 
[01:42:00]  Two more and then we'll move on.  Mike in Kentucky.  What's up?  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Hey.  My old man was going to whip my ass with a belt for about the 60th time.  And I decided that I wasn't going to have it anymore.  So I grabbed my shotgun.  Went on out in the woods.  I was probably about nine years old.  But I was going to go out there and be Grizzly Adams and survive on the land.  Yeah.  I got out there and sat around.  It was in the fall time for about five, six hours.  It started getting dark and I got scared. 
[01:42:30]  I remember my old man yelling at me when I was in the woods.  You got to come back to eat, you little thump bitch.  So I was getting hungry and he was right.  I went on back to the house and they fed me and then he put me in the bedroom there.  And he got the belt out, whipped my ass with the belt anyway.  It's probably harder than he was going to.  Wow.  That's good.  So you are going to run away.  Belting on the ass.  And then it got dark and you had to turn around.  I got dark.  It got dark.  I got hungry and he was right.  And I probably got it worse than I would have if I just would have hung around. 
[01:43:00]  But that was my lesson.  See, I knew it.  Most of these end with you got to go back home.  But this guy, I wonder if this is true.  Richie in Connecticut, tell your story.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I was 12 years old, 1986.  I ran away to Washington, the state of Washington.  I was from Long Island.  My parents were Coke dealers and I just took $8,000.  Maybe even though I was gone for two weeks, I thought I was at my grandmother's house.  And you really went cross country at 12?  I got nailed in McDonald's. 
[01:43:30]  The reason I went to Washington is because the Goonies were from Washington.  I couldn't believe it was them or some shit like that.  Wait, wait.  Hold on, sir.  You got a big laugh so we missed the next line.  So the Goonies were from Washington.  So I thought I'd go live out there and live with the Goonies or something.  I don't know how I was thinking.  But they caught me in McDonald's because there was a cop next to me.  And I took out.  I had like $600 in cash.  And he's like, where did you get that money, little fella?  And they wound up nailing me that way. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, that sucks.  Smart enough to get across country with $8,000.  Dumb enough to think the Goonies are real.  12 years ago, at least I wasn't sucking cock under a dog.  You missed out.  That's true.  You should have turned your parents in.  Yeah, well, bobcat sucks.  Help me die.  That was really funny, though.  Oliver, Texas.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I remember one time when I was like, eight years old. 
[01:44:30]  I got pissed at my mom.  I don't know what she wanted me to do.  I think I was like, clean my room.  And I looked up at her and I said, well, you know what?  You don't love me anymore.  I'm going to run away.  And she looked down at me with that stern face.  My mom had a set of balls on her.  And she looked down at me.  And she goes, well, fucking do it.  And so she goes off and does her own little thing, sits down.  I don't know what she was doing.  So I walk outside.  Right when I get into the middle of the street, I look back at the house.  I got cold.  And I just said to myself, oh, well, she's going to come out because she's going to feel sorry.  She's going to be crying. 
[01:45:00]  She's not going to know where I am.  So what I ended up doing is I hid in the neighbor's bushes.  And so I'm crouched there in the bushes like a dumbass.  And the neighbor comes out and looks into the bushes and sees me.  And I look it up in one of those big eyes.  And I said, shh, I'm not here.  And my neighbor pretended I wasn't there.  And then he comes out with the big old, you know, that huge water gun you'd attach to your water hoses.  Yeah.  It starts spraying me down.  And I get all wet and muddy.  And so when I come back home, I finally, because I was getting sick, so I come back home. 
[01:45:30]  I walk inside.  My mom's sitting there having a martini on the couch.  He looks at me.  And she just starts laughing.  And I just go home a wet mess and a broken shell of a kid.  Oh, Jesus.  That is good.  So, yeah, I'm checking out, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Bill in Iowa.  Bill.  Yeah, I was, like, seven.  And I'm like, yeah, I'm doing the same thing.  I'm running the fuck away, you guys, or whatever.  I had to clean my room.  Something stupid like that.  And my dad's like, all right, fine.  So he throws all my shit in a bag, gets me in the car and drives me out of the bus station.  Here, I got you on my ticket.  Where do you want to go? 
[01:46:00]  And I started bawling like a little girl with a skinned knee.  And, of course, went home that night and spent the week in the house, in the room.  So they never worked out.  It seems like a good idea, but you bailed at the last minute.  Let's go to Bruce in North Carolina.  Bruce.  Yeah, I ran away in nothing but my underwear one time.  I told my mom I was going to run away.  And she says, well, I bought those fucking clothes, so take them off.  Jesus.  You can run away.  You run away naked.  And all she let me wear was a pair of fucking tighty-whities. 
[01:46:30]  I made it about six miles before.  Before you had lots of rides.  Yeah, exactly.  Imagine a pedophile going, oh, my God.  All right.  It's like, all right, who's fucking with me?  He would just get out of one car door into the next one.  It's got to be my pedophile friend.  They're fucking with me.  What is this, April 1st?  What's real?  That's a midget.  There's no way that's real.  Huh?  I swear to God, a cop picked me up and then took me to my grandparents' house, and then 
[01:47:00]  they got me some clothes.  Oh, you're so lucky, my friend.  Yeah.  We're trying to move on, but the stories are really coming.  Like, we got James in Iowa.  James, go ahead.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, when I was 16 years old, my parents ran away from me.  They ran away from you?  I come home from the school.  My mom, my dad, and my little brother moved to a whole new town.  Get out of here.  Hey, God's truth, man.  Were they renting, or was it?  No, I got in a fight.  The old man knocked the hell out of him. 
[01:47:30]  When I was 16, they sold the fucking house and moved the whole thing three days.  And where were you then?  You didn't notice this was going down.  I was in high school.  I was 16.  I was going to school.  Right, right.  I come, they went and got my, picked up my brother from school early.  I didn't know it, because he was in grade school.  Did you know where they, go ahead.  I got home, and all my shit was on the front porch.  But what the fuck says the house is empty?  What the hell?  I hung out for a few years.  I didn't know where they lived. 
[01:48:00]  I was 21 years old and married.  Wow.  That's a great story, man.  Jesus.  Yeah, laugh if you will, motherfuckers.  It kind of destroyed my wife.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I just thought the word the other way.  All right.  I'm just kidding.  What'd you call up for help?  Yeah, no kidding.  Retard kid in a humpback fucking retard.  That's pretty funny, man.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I'm just kidding.  Is this the Brother Joe?  Brother Joe.  Yo, yo, guys.  Ant, do you remember in Central Islip when I ran away and you went out? 
[01:48:30]  You went out.  Actually, you encouraged me to do it at first, and then you went out, and you busted me, and  you brought me back home.  And the old man beat the living shit out of me.  Yeah.  Wait, what happened?  I figured I could make some points.  Really?  I'm bringing him back.  Yeah.  Like, I'll bring him back.  I'll get him.  He's a politician.  Yeah.  First, I'm like, I'm telling him to go.  And he goes.  And then I was like, yeah, I know where he is, so I'll bring him back. 
[01:49:00]  And I brought him back.  And of course, yeah, the old man pulled out the strap and nailed both of us.  Why you, though?  You guys were-  I don't know.  Were you in cahoots together?  It was what to do.  Because he's a fucking traitor.  Yeah, he's a traitor.  Fucking traitor.  Turn your brother in.  I'll bring your boy back.  The head, the tail, the whole damn thing.  The whole damn thing.  Okay, so I can run away again.  I'll talk to you later.  All right.  We got, well, this one's pretty good, too.  Damn. 
[01:49:30]  Tom in Westchester.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, boys.  I ran away when I was about 11.  I took my Raleigh three-speed.  I drove from the Bronx to Orchard Beach.  Would a banana seat?  High handlebar, sissy bar.  Hold on, hold on.  You got to back up a little bit, Tom.  Yeah.  So you rode from where to where?  Yeah, I was 11 years old.  I ran away from home because I was pissed at my parents.  I took my Raleigh three-speed bike.  I drove to Orchard Beach about maybe a quarter mile from the beach when I got a flat tire or  the chain fell off or something.  This guy pulls up while I'm walking, says he'll take me home, opens up his trunk and 
[01:50:00]  throws my bike in.  And I'm just about to get into the driver's side of the car when I look in the back seat  because I had a weird feeling about this dude.  Both of the back door locks were wired shut with coat hangers.  No.  I said, no, no, thanks.  I'm not going to get in the car.  Just give me my bike back.  The guy started screaming and pleading at me to get in.  When I refused, he drove away with the bike.  I had to go to the stranger's house and call my parents.  My father picked me up in the car and fucking beat the shit out of me.  You never saw your bike again, huh? 
[01:50:30]  Guys, like, sniffed the seat until there was no covering left on it.  All he found was the seat with nostril marks all over it.  Oh, were you a little sweaty, upset with dad boy acid in the city only a few hours before?  That guy's probably like a bloodhound.  He probably smelled your bike seat so much he knew what you were fighting about.  Oh, he was upset he wanted to stay out later. 
[01:51:00]  He wears Landry Tomp, but not today.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Seat is worn.  In a way, I'm sure he wears tough skins.  You know how big your bag was?  By the way, his little ball mark was very subtly worn to the side of your seat.  You're fucking...  The CSI of children's seats.  He knew exactly.  All those wheelies you did, you frightened boy ass. 
[01:51:30]  Wow.  Let's go to Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  You're on the OPNF show.  How's it going?  I actually have a runaway story that worked.  I was about eight years old.  I wanted to go on a trip with my friends.  And I ran away and I snuck back in through the basement and snuck back up to the basement  door and listened to them.  And, you know, they laughed about it when I first left.  And time went on and time went on.  And, you know, meanwhile, there's all the luxuries of a house in the basement.  There's TV to watch, a couch.  I just relaxed and listened to them freak out more and more to the point where they called 
[01:52:00]  the police and they left the house.  When they left the house, I had a free run of the house.  I just hung out, watched TV, ate dinner, and waited until they finally came back to freaking  out and then let them know, you know, I'm going on the trip and end up going on trips.  Thanks, Macaulay Culton.  Ah, whatever.  Macaulay Culton?  I got a little nervous with the c-c-c-cals.  Macaulay Culton.  You know who's the first one to snap on you when you mispronounce something? 
[01:52:30]  Well, dude, that wasn't just a close one.  Macaulay Culton doesn't exist.  You made a person up.  I just, I hate how serial killer smart you are.  You don't have to be smart to know Macaulay Culton.  That's not exactly a Harvard BA to know that little douche.  Yeah, you bang trannies.  Who doesn't?  What am I, a communist?  That's my comeback.  He just pulls that one out whenever he can.  I'm surprised you didn't call him trannies, stupid.  A little t-shirt. 
[01:53:00]  Let's go to Washington.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, a little back story.  My stepdad was just getting out of the military,  so we decided we were going to tour Europe on motorcycles.  I was about seven years old, and I wanted some ice cream,  and I wanted it bad.  And complained, complained, complained,  and next thing I know I'm standing in a street corner in France  by myself for about two hours. 
[01:53:30]  Now, if that didn't scare the shit out of me, then nothing did.  Yeah, you wouldn't even know where the hell you are.  That's creepy as a kid.  Yeah, in France.  In France.  All right, we got it.  Thank God it worked out.  So you're Macaulay Culkin.  Yeah, Macaulay Culkin.  Culkin.  Macaulay Culkin.  I'm going to try one more, and then we're going to possibly end this.  I was doing a character.  There was a word you couldn't say, but we'll get back to that.  Remind me of what he couldn't say.  Oh, go ahead.  I don't remember.  What word couldn't you say?  Oh, I can't say pho- 
[01:54:00]  Eminent.  Philanthropist.  Philanthropist?  Eminent?  Yeah.  Eminent?  You said it now, right, but you can't say enement.  I can't say, I can say en-  Fuck me.  Enement?  What word can't you say?  Philanthropist?  What is it?  How do you say it?  Just say it.  Does it matter?  Just say it once and I can get it.  No.  So you do an impression like a parrot?  No.  Figure it out.  Say entemens a few more times.  Entemens?  I could say that.  I thought I could say.  Eminent, he could say.  Philanthropist.  Philanthropist.  Philanthropist.  Philanthropist.  Now you get me saying it wrong, fuck. 
[01:54:30]  It happens.  Palopanese.  Philanthropist.  That's somebody who's nice to flowers.  All right, let's-  Rachel.  Jason in New York, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  When I was about seven years old, we lived in the country.  We never lived in a town.  So I got really pissed off at my dad one day, and I went into the woods.  And we had a bear.  We had a bear and a couple coyotes that lived around the house, and a bobcat. 
[01:55:00]  So by dark time, I got pretty scared, and a deer ran through the yard, and I freaked out  and ran back to the house.  That's all it took.  Yeah.  I think it's funny now that even as an adult, you describe it as dark time.  It's a child-like description.  Dark time came.  Dark time came.  I had to go.  I got to piss.  Yeah, we'll take a break.  Kevin and the trucker, what's up?  Hey, man.  I was about 12 years old.  I hated my dad.  My mom wouldn't leave me.  He used to knock us kids around quite a bit. 
[01:55:30]  So I decided I was going to run away.  I was going to go live with my stepdad, my mom's previous husband, in Arizona, living  in Washington State.  So I hitchhiked down I-5, ended up getting a ride all the way to Hollywood.  And I was walking around the streets of Hollywood, walking down the hill, and the guy goes, whoa.  I was looking up at the building, and the guy goes, whoa, you can't go that way.  Not from around here, obviously.  I'll give you a place to stay.  Well, he was living with his sister in a flat in North Sycamore Street or whatever, 
[01:56:00]  somewhere around there, and he'd go to work, and his sister, Debbie, who turned out to  be his girlfriend, de-virginized me.  Wow.  And, yeah, found out that it was going on, and he took me down to the basement, or was  trying to, and I hit the first-floor button on the elevator.  He chased me down the street with a meat cleaver.  I ended up in Arizona in a jubilant institution, and my dad flew me back home.  So, ended up.  Shake it up! 
[01:56:30]  Shake it up!  Shake it up!  Shake it up!  Shake it up!  I'm sorry, man.  I smoke a lot.  Yeah.  It sounds like you already have the street.  What do you smoke, carburetors?  Shake it up!  Keep smoking.  Guy puts tobacco on a car engine, and then just puts his mouth on a tailpipe.  Shake it up!  Shake it up!  Shake it up!  All right, sir.  Good story. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, all right, man.  Take it easy.  All right.  Well, this is worth going to.  Say the guy lived in a bacon-smoking house.  Shake it up!  He lived in a glass gargulterium.  What'd you do?  Oh, we made asbestos cookies.  Or the kingdom of nakedness.  Hey, Scourge.  So I went out to the desert and started the kingdom of nakedness.  That is some friggin' voice.  Uh, Lionheart, what's up?  What's up, pal?  How's it going on?  Hey, man.  Make it quick. 
[01:57:30]  We all got a piss.  Yeah, we all...  There's a lot of peeing that's about to happen.  Is that going to take a shit?  I was about nine in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  I figured I was going to take off.  I was mad at my dad for something.  And I figured the best place...  Me and my friends had this fort.  You know, we built in this woods by our house.  I figured I was going to head out there because, you know, that's a safe place to be.  But around nine o'clock, I realized, man, I should have brought a light.  It's really dark out here.  And then about ten o'clock, I realized that the fort where I had...  Me and my kids played during the day was where they did a lot of drug deals at night.  And a bunch of fellas who didn't speak any English started showing up and... 
[01:58:00]  And what?  Oh, I'm sorry, dude.  How about you hung up on me?  No, we're listening.  We want to.  We're good listeners on the show from time to time.  No, they just started doing drug deals around me and looking at me and talking to each other about me.  And eventually I just left and I went to...  The only other thing I knew to do was go to Krauser's and ask them if I could stay there.  Krauser's.  Called the cops.  What a Jersey reference.  Called the cops.  What's Krauser's? 
[01:58:30]  It's a guy that's a 7-Eleven in Jersey.  Okay.  Can I, like, work here and you give me some food or something?  What is this, the fucking 30s?  He's one of the little rascals.  Can I work here?  Sure you can, kid.  But you can't bring that dog.  And they told me I could.  So they put me doing something in the back.  Spanky.  Yeah, you always had the impression that you should have the stick with the fucking bandana on it and something in there.  I don't know what it was supposed to be in there when you ran away. 
[01:59:00]  A can of beans.  Yeah.  Fucking diaper.  Almost people always ate beans.  Beans.  Yeah, they did.  Come on.  They had just that bandana and the stick, but then all of a sudden there was a frying pan somewhere.  They'd have a frying pan, beans, and a big, huge fucking spoon to shovel it into their mouths with.  And the beans always looked great.  Did they?  Oh, they looked great with a big hunk of pork in it.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On Sirius XM. 
[01:59:30]  Sam, coming up after the break, we have a big-time movie star coming in.  Kurt Russell.  Nobody got a photo or something.  Yes.  This appearance led to Big Kev being banned for years.  Unfortunately, none of that comes out on the air.  What you will get is an interview with Kurt Russell.  And that's coming up next.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Sam, we have in studio the star of the original Stargate movie, Kurt Russell. 
[02:00:00]  Who cares?  I love that movie.  He's been in a lot more than the original Stargate movie.  It was Jack O'Neill.  What about Overboard with Goldie Hawn?  What about Captain Ron?  What about Big Trouble in Little China?  This is true.  On this day, he was promoting his role as Stuntman Mike in the Quentin Tarantino half of the Grindhouse movie.  One of your favorites.  Yes.  I love the character.  I love the movie.  The whole thing was great.  Listen as the legendary Kurt Russell waxes poetic on the art of acting here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:00:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to get right into this.  We've got Kurt Russell in studio.  Grindhouse opens next Friday, right, Kurt?  Yeah, they're going to unleash it.  Yeah, that looks great, man.  It's an amazing night.  I was at the premiere in Los Angeles in Austin, Texas, and, you know, I think they get ready for it, but it's just been a long time since there's been a movie done where it's an interactive experience where, you know, you yell at the screen. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And you try to not turn away, you know.  Yeah, Tarantino also, it's like, you know, he puts his name on a movie.  People are going to go see it.  It's just, how is he to work with?  Incredible.  His level of knowledge of the industry and the history of it is incredible, and that's what this night is about.  It's just a step back in time, you know, to when the double feature was what we did. 
[02:01:30]  That's what makes his movie so cool, too, is like that whole retro thing, because he does.  He kind of grew up and absorbed all that stuff and puts it in his movie, so if you're the same age as him or around that age, you look at certain things and go, God damn, I forgot about that.  Yeah, and it's kind of like being in his class, his film class, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  As the years go by and he keeps making movies, you learn more and more and more about film through his love for it.  I also like his ability to take people, not you, for example, but someone like Travolta with Pulp Fiction and actually see the potential that, hey, if I bring this guy into a movie, it's not going to be a goof. 
[02:02:00]  Like, what are you bringing this guy into a movie for?  In my instance, one of the things he said to me was, he said, look, you've got a rogues gallery of characters, and I want Stuntman Mike to be up there on the wall with them.  And he said, I just, I'm sorry, but I want to see you be a badass again.  Yeah, yeah.  When I read the script, I went, you know, if you're going to work for Tarantino, you want to be a badass.  Of course. 
[02:02:30]  Right, right.  So this guy's a psychotic mess to boot, so it was just a blast.  I know, just the clip I saw from the trailer is hysterical.  You're in that car, and I gather, what's the basic gist of the storyline?  It's real, well, you know, there's always a sliver of morality to these old Grindhouse films,  and this one is that, you know, if you're a young girl going to the bar to have a few drinks,  and you just get a little too loose, and you need a ride home,  you might be making the mistake of getting into Stuntman Mike's car.  So don't do that, and he uses a car, like some serial killers, you know, use knives or guns or whatever. 
[02:03:00]  But it's, you know, it is in the Grindhouse atmosphere of craziness.  It's just a blast.  Yeah, very retro.  It's funny.  It's just, it's so crazy that, but at times, it's not.  At times, it's like it was then.  It was like, it's so shocking or awesome when you look at it.  You're stunned for a few minutes, and then 30 seconds later, you're laughing really hard at what just stunned you. 
[02:03:30]  That's correct.  I love that about his movies.  Yeah, nobody does that better than him, and this one's just chock or block full of that.  You go to a premiere and watch it, and then like, oh, this is not quite what I wanted.  Oh, sure.  Like, you know, that happens all the time.  Every time you go to work, you try to do, you know, something you hope is going to really work for the audience and the style of movie that you're doing.  Speaking of premieres, really, I got a quick story.  Poseidon, you were in Poseidon, and I was actually in the theater when you watched, watched it for the first time. 
[02:04:00]  I told this story on the air, and I'm with my girlfriend, and I see Kurt Russell, like, you're about five, six rows in front of us, and you're going down the aisle trying to find a seat.  And you sit right next to this girl.  She has no idea it's you.  I don't even know if you're going to remember this.  That's fine, but I was observing this whole thing.  She goes, ah, that seat's taken.  And I want to stand up and go, that's Kurt Russell.  He's in the movie.  Let him sit wherever the hell he was.  And you were so polite, like, oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:04:30]  And then you found another seat.  Sure, that's okay about me.  Got up?  Wow.  And then I'm watching you watch yourself on the big screen, which I just thought was beyond bizarre to me.  I actually got to do one scene in that movie that I really wanted to do was the drowning scene.  Oh, man, that was sick.  Yeah, I didn't see that coming.  It was one of those moments where you're like, oh, my God, they're going to kill him off.  That was the entire fun of it.  See, I liked the remake, though.  I know a lot of people, but I really enjoyed it.  It was so close to being a really, really good movie. 
[02:05:00]  And it got right to the action.  Yeah, the action scenes were amazing.  Yeah, it just went right for it.  And your scene when you drowned was, wow, it was really good.  And I think you left right after that.  You're like, all right, I don't need to see anyone.  Yeah, I just wanted to see that.  That's all I wanted to see.  I know there's going to be no sexy Shelly Winters up the dress shop, so why stick her out?  Why stick her out?  What's left?  I know how this ends.  I'm done.  I came to see myself.  Let's be honest.  And obviously, you've got to be sick of talking about it because everybody asks you about it.  But Gilligan's Island. 
[02:05:30]  Kurt was on Gilligan's Island.  I love seeing megastars on these cool little movies.  I did a lot of Gilligan's Island type things.  Was that your first thing, though, that you ever did?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  No, unfortunately, I've been around a long time before that.  Yeah, we all grew up watching you with the Disney films.  No, I started pretty well.  Disney films.  I was a little nothing.  The computer wore tennis shoes.  What will you see?  As a matter of fact, believe it or not, I mean, the weird thing about those days was when  Quentin was getting ready to do Grindhouse, he said, I'm going to show you a night of a couple 
[02:06:00]  movies.  And he said, I'm going to have a lot.  He's going to have an hour and a half of coming attractions.  He said, I'll really show you what it was about.  And two of them were movies, Disney movies that I had done.  And it reminded me that, that's right, I used to sometimes go to the theater and you'd  see a horror film or something and you'd see, you know, a coming attraction for a Disney  picture.  And they were all, you didn't know what you were going to get.  And that was the fun of the night, too.  You didn't know what was coming next. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  So it was, it was at that night at Quentin's was really fun.  Because I think everybody at that point, because a lot of young people that were going to be  in the movie had never, they'd never experienced that.  And they kind of really, they began to get the idea of what this was.  We were talking about trailers for movies earlier and how they've changed over the  years, you know, and when you see one from years ago, it brings you right back and you  just action, suspense, you'll be at the edge of your seat. 
[02:07:00]  And the voice quality of those guys, one of my favorites is just keep telling yourself  over and over, it's just a movie.  They did that.  These were the kind of flicks that you told your mom, you'd seen like a Bush cast in a  Sundance kid twice.  So you really knew it well.  Then you told your mom and dad, we're going to go see that again.  And you snuck off to go see the, you know, the picture where these versions will be 
[02:07:30]  violated in ways you can't imagine.  I mean, so you could talk about it on Monday.  And the only question you had Monday morning was, did you ever look away from the screen?  Did you watch the whole thing?  And never, never once could a guy say, I watched the whole thing.  It was like, no, man, I couldn't turn away when that thing was happening with the, we're  eating the rats.  Oh, man.  No one will be seated during the basement sequence.  What happens in the basement?  It's great.  It's a lost art.  It was, but you know what?  It's, it's cool.  And, and, and at the same time, I think the thing that I experienced the most that was, 
[02:08:00]  was, was, was really exceptional was not just the detail with which Robert and Quentin  wanted to do this night, but in Quentin's movie, um, it's got that Quentin pulp fiction  feeling, which is, this is dead on.  This is dead on.  And this isn't, these people aren't doing camp or anything.  They're, they're, they're doing the movie and there's a, there's an accident in that.  That's just, it's the most shocking thing I've ever seen.  It's just unbelievable shot. 
[02:08:30]  He had a problem.  He had to cut a lot of stuff, right?  Yeah.  Well, some of it was just, you know, just way over the top.  Well, no, it's just, some of it was just, you know, you couldn't use it.  Director's cut DVD.  Well, that's what I was going to say, by the way, that's come out.  Yeah.  Come on.  That's what's so great about the movies that come out now.  Cause I'm sure like you as an actor and directors, they get frustrated, like, oh, this is such  a great scene and I got to cut it to get the ratings, uh, you know, uh, where years ago  you'd never see that.  You would never see it, but now at least with the DVD, you're going to see all this extra  stuff.  Well, you know, one of the things I think needs clarification is the, the night of grindhouse 
[02:09:00]  is two movies.  It's two full movies.  Rodriguez movie is planet terror.  Then there's coming attractions for movies that don't exist.  Oh, fantastic.  And then there's an, and then there's the, the, the, the, the, the, you know, the next  movie, which is, uh, which is death proof.  Now, when they go out on the DVD, they're going to go out separately.  And when they go to Europe, it's going to go.  Oh, wow.  Like we're going to, we're going to the con film festival.  Wow.  Yeah.  You know, but it's, you know, it, it, it can cover that base.  This is the first movie in a while.  I'm very excited to see.  Oh, hell yeah.  Can I tell you something? 
[02:09:30]  I'm serious.  I can tell you something.  You guys are going to have a blast.  The amazing thing about this movie that I watch is that at the end of the movie, it's  a, it's a female empowering movie.  And the women just, the two screens I've seen, they, they just stand up and give it a standing  oath because they, they did not see this coming.  Oh, cool.  And it's hard to get that message out there.  But you know, these were pictures where girls used to like to go to them because they knew  it was an excuse for the guy to like semi protect them at times. 
[02:10:00]  You know what I mean?  And you knew that too.  But at the end of the day here, there's some twists on these two films.  Are you selling this as a chick flick?  It is.  You know what?  You know what?  At the end of the day, this is the crazy new chick flick.  Really?  No kidding.  I'm not kidding.  It's kind of, well, as a twist at the end with my character that it, it will, for those  who loved Escape from New York and the thing and pictures that I did like that, there's  some stuff you don't see.  Why don't you, why don't you just tell us the twist?  I can't. 
[02:10:30]  I can't because it's just too much fun.  You guys are, I hope the three of you see it together so you can like elbow each other  all the way through it.  We will.  Girls don't like us.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  As long as Jimmy doesn't cut the bottom out of the popcorn again.  That old gag.  I have a question about Escape from New York, and this has bugged me since 1981.  Why, when Donald Pleasance is hauling you up the wall, does he have to stop your ascent  to shoot Isaac Hayes?  Just to aggravate you.  Just to aggravate you.  You are the Duke of New York.  You are the Duke.  Yeah, you know, just to aggravate you.  And make you say, you gotta get snake up. 
[02:11:00]  No, just hang out there while he's firing off at the president and he's shooting at you.  He was a president who wore a blonde wig, so, you know.  That's one of those movies that if it's on, you're watching it.  You know, you got to watch some of those.  Are there movies, though, that you've made that at the time were, like, great movies,  did very well at the theater, people loved them, but you look back and they didn't date well.  One of them I just saw recently, and me and Jimmy have a love-hate relationship with this movie,  we talk about it all the time, Tango and Cash. 
[02:11:30]  Well, Tango and Cash was a movie that was made for 15-year-old boys.  I don't know how old you guys were at the time.  It's literally made for that audience, and it center punches that, you know.  Once you move out of that, that movie's not meant for you.  No, then it gets hysterical.  Yeah, and then it's funny, and that's why, you know, that's supposed to be that.  No, what's been my experience is sort of the opposite, is that John Carpenter, I made movies years ago,  Bob Zemeckis and I made Used Cars, and at the time—  Used Cars was really funny.  Yep, we talk about that one all the time, too. 
[02:12:00]  At the time, these movies were—I don't—they didn't really know what they were.  They didn't really know how to sell them.  And over the years, the audience that has grown to love them, they're very proprietary about them.  I mean, they really love them.  It's like Tombstone.  They're proprietary about that movie.  That, for them, is the Western.  And it's fun to watch the life that they have, because some of them, quite a few of them at the time,  you know, they got kind of like a mediocre release, and then there was a lot of the intelligentsia that just flat didn't get it. 
[02:12:30]  I mean, Big Trouble in Little China was something that critics just flat didn't understand.  Yeah.  And I kind of like that.  And this is another movie that, you know, I don't know what this movie's going to do.  It's completely—there's nothing else like it out there.  There won't be anything like it.  And, you know, it's one of those movies that I know, though.  The integrity is complete.  It is exactly what it's supposed to be, and like it or not.  Quentin's dialogue is great, too.  So he can write some great dialogue where you're just like, oh, my God, this stuff is brilliant or hysterical, funny. 
[02:13:00]  And it really says something.  It always says something.  He's tremendous to work with.  Yeah.  There's something actors do, which I read.  I was shocked, too, that you were the voice of Elvis in Forrest Gump.  And it's an uncredited thing, and it's like obviously you just wanted to do it because you love Elvis.  No, I wanted to do it because I love Bob Zemeckis.  Bob came to me and he said, I need you to do—  That's called a favor.  I need you to do something.  And I said, well, what is it?  And he told me what it was.  And I said, oh, cool.  I said, let's not do a, you know, what do you call it, a credit. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, you didn't want to do it.  I said, let's let people find this out over a period of time.  And I always liked it because people would always say, well, now what was your most successful movie?  And I always like to say, well, Forrest Gump.  You made the most money.  Used car.  I'm such a dope—that's one of my favorite comedies of all time.  It is one of the funniest films ever done.  And people don't talk about it.  Like that and Hollywood Nights, I think, were two of the funniest movies nobody ever talks about.  Well, you're wrong.  A lot of guys do.  You'll find them.  You just got to find guys like you.  When they say comedies, they always find, like, Ace Ventura. 
[02:14:00]  People I talk to, they always mention these over-the-top—and that was just—you know, this is a red effing car, Rudy.  I mean, it just doesn't get any better than that.  God, I forgot that.  I was such an ass.  Yeah, that was back in the day.  79 or 80, I think, right?  Yeah.  It was Bob's second movie.  And, you know, that same thing—I'll tell you what was great about working on this picture with Quentin was it had that atmosphere.  When I was doing those pictures with John and with Bob, we were just a bunch of kids having fun.  And we were just out there having fun, doing what we wanted to do. 
[02:14:30]  This picture is just like that.  We were just doing what we wanted to do.  And you got the Pied Piper leading the way, who's just a savant when it comes to film.  I mean, there's nothing he doesn't remember that he's seen, and there's very little he hasn't seen.  Yeah.  He is a little—he comes across as a little twisted in interviews and stuff.  Well, he's manic.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  But he's always logical.  Easy to work with?  Oh, God, yeah.  I mean, he's just a blast.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  But he's got his own world, and he creates it on film.  Yeah.  That's the Quentin Tarantino world, you know?  Yeah, it's definitely unique.  And it's a fun one to play in.  Yeah, unique look.  Yeah.  How funny—how fun was it?  First of all, Frank McRae, for those of you who don't know, he's a big black guy.  He was in his cars.  Great guy.  He shoved the old man in the car.  Just get in the car.  I don't want to look inside.  Just get in the mother—  Every car shoves him in.  The greatest bullying scene ever.  And then you being beaten up by Jack Warden.  I mean, how great was that? 
[02:15:30]  With a chain in a pickup truck.  What a savage.  That is just a damn funny movie.  He talks about it all the time.  You can't not.  It's one of those films.  It's just everything.  It was great tasteless humor.  It was just the dead guy being driven into an exploding thing with gas on him.  Yeah, it's a little irreverent.  What about Escape from New York?  We're hearing things about a remake.  Yeah, I guess they're going to—I don't know.  I mean, you know, listen, everything's fair game.  I've watched them turn Stargate into a television series and backdraft into a couple of shows. 
[02:16:00]  I don't understand why they have to remake some of these classic movies.  I don't know.  Again—  It comes up from time to time.  You're like, what was the one with Peter Falk that we all loved that they made?  And it was on the shelves for years.  The In-Logs.  I'm like, why would you ever remake this movie?  It was perfect.  Right.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, studios have different reasons.  They see something that they think they can do well with.  And Escape from New York was just an amazing movie.  Yeah, well, listen, it'll always be there.  John Carpenter's version's always going to be there.  My version of Snake Plissken's always going to be there. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Hey, they're going to have to face comparisons, so they're going to be up against it trying  to do a good movie.  But, you know, I've done characters that were being done at the same time.  I remember when Kevin Costner and I were doing—he was doing Wyatt Earp.  I was doing Tombstone.  All right, yeah.  And, you know, you go out there and you throw it out there and you see what the people think.  See what happens.  That was an odd situation.  Like, that pretty much was at the same time.  Yeah.  A lot of people got confused.  Yeah.  Like, who the hell is who?  Why don't you play the president in the new one?  That'd be great to see you as the president.  Although the greatest sound in movie history is the clunk of your bat with the nail in it 
[02:17:00]  hitting that bald head in Escape from New York.  That could be the best sound.  Yeah.  But when you play Snake, when you create Snake—somebody said to me the other day,  hey, would you do a cameo in Escape from New York?  You know, I don't know if I can say this, but I'm going to.  And I said, oh, fuck that.  I mean, I was Snake.  I'm not going to become the buffoon in the thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll do that now in a different movie, which is like, that's part of what's fun about Death  Proof, is I got a chance to take that persona, that aura, and amp it up about 100 degrees 
[02:17:30]  and have a blast and turn it on its head.  Yeah.  It was a good time.  We've got to get him out of here.  He's got to do the Today Show.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, we're having a great time with you, Kurt Russell.  You guys are fun.  The film is Grindhouse.  Amazing, yeah.  And it's done by Tarantino with, obviously, Kurt Russell and Rosaria Dawson and Rose McGowan.  It's just, you know, it's actually a film I'm looking forward to.  It really sounds great.  Just keep telling yourself over and over, it's just a movie. 
[02:18:00]  Only a movie.  Hey, Kurt, thank you so much.  Thanks, man.  It was good talking to you guys.  Great.  It was fun.  We'll continue in just a bit.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  This is the worst, is the worst O.P. and Anthony.  The Virus Serious XM.  Sam, after the break, we're going to crack open a book, have everybody cozy around a  fire, and have an old-fashioned sex game.  I was hoping you'd say it's Steve Weiser.  You're 21, right?  Oh, yes, Steve Weiser's.  When we get back.  Sam, who doesn't enjoy a good sex game?  I guess most people like a sex game.  What's a sex game?  Well, I'm not entirely sure. 
[02:18:30]  We got this book at one point from a then-friend of the show, Laura Korn.  She was a sex therapist.  What made her not be a friend of the show anymore?  We just decided to not have her on anymore.  Oh.  And I guess somewhere in her book, she had some kind of detailed game that couples could  play together.  Eric?  Yeah?  It's time to play a sex game.  Yes!  Right here on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm the thimble.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Taking a look at some material here.  Laura Korn's going to be in studio in about a week. 
[02:19:00]  I'm digging this book.  What's wrong, Ed?  It's my painter.  Hi, sir.  I'm on the air right now.  Anthony says you're a size queen.  Yeah.  Anthony says you're on the air.  Call him back, faggot.  Call him back.  Why don't you paint your face with my cock?  Anthony wants you to make a pass.  How about I paint your asshole with my prick?  You fucking painter.  We'll paint each other up.  Why don't you finger paint inside a little vagina? 
[02:19:30]  Why don't you finger paint my asshole, you whore?  I'll call you when I get home.  Yeah, painting is for dick suckers.  You dick sucker painter.  Where did it all go wrong that you're painting Anthony's house?  Exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My friends.  Yeah.  Why don't you paint the toilet seat with your tongue, shit dick?  Me and my need for wonderful wallpaper.  Anthony hates Jews and wallpaper.  Thank you, sir.  I'll contact you later.  Bye. 
[02:20:00]  He didn't hear it.  I'm going to need a new painter.  Why?  I don't know.  He didn't sound very entertained by everything that was going on here.  Fuck.  What?  What's your fault?  He came highly recommended because it didn't say the number.  Usually it says the number.  You're not.  Oh, no.  I need a new painter.  Listen.  Damn it.  So we're looking at the Laura Korn sex game.  Yeah, what's with the board game?  It's a board game.  Oh, it's set up like, first of all, the board looks like Trivial Pursuit a little bit. 
[02:20:30]  It doesn't have where you can cross in the middle.  It's just a round circle.  Let's all do this and have to do to each other what turns up on the board.  That'll be fun.  We need a girl.  Travis, come on.  Bring that cat.  Oh, that's a bit.  Wait, for her eyes only.  Is someone eating egg whites right now or did someone just fart?  I can never tell.  Holy shit.  No, you know what it was?  We were talking about planes.  I was scared that I was going to get shot by a plane.  Dan, you got to help me.  I was scared. 
[02:21:00]  You were pushing out some courage.  That was courage forcing out my fear so I could endure.  What the fuck is this?  Holy shit.  Oh, what's the matter with you?  That game stinks.  Oh, it's Jimmy.  Oh, come on.  Don't be fresh.  Let me see some cards.  How do you play?  All right, here's some cards.  Give me some cards.  I want to play with the cards, Opie.  Oh, shit.  Here's your cards.  Fucking wailed it.  I'm like a Chinese star. 
[02:21:30]  Why did you throw my cards hard for me?  Why does it say they're up against the wall?  Obstacle card.  Lazy boy.  I don't know what this means.  Lazy boy, busy girl.  The cat technique.  Oral override.  The pizza man always rings twice.  Massage, collage.  All right, how does it work?  Fan rules?  Yes.  You got some rules?  All right.  Yes.  One second to turn on.  Oh, there you go.  Object of the game.  Players move their markers around the game board,  competing to collect secret sealed seduction cards. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, are they supposed to be secretly sealed?  Yeah, well, I got one.  Okay.  Okay.  The first player to collect five.  Five.  Five, all right.  Secret sealed seduction cards is declared the winner.  And then what happens?  The winner chooses to either seduce their lover or be seduced.  What is this for fucking people with nine kids?  Who fucking gets off on this?  The seducer must then open the secret sealed seduction card chosen by the winner and follow 
[02:22:30]  the instructions inside.  Uh-huh.  One seduction for now and one for later.  I want to do one for now.  What, uh, now what are the rest of the spots on the board?  Yeah.  Like, what are the, what's the question mark and the, the little, like, um, moving around  the board.  It's kind of like Monopoly, but if you, if you land on the thing normally in jail, you  have to get AIDS during the game.  The get AIDS free.  The question mark is, uh, trivia question.  Okay.  Um, where's the question?  Where are the questions? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, where's the trivia questions?  Uh, I don't see questions.  There's a notepad.  You got, I think you guys have trivia questions.  These aren't, mine just says, these are the tips.  These are supposed to be the hidden fucking, yeah, panty roulette.  Trivia questions.  That's the wall.  Your partner should pick up their sexual trivia book.  Where's that?  Where's the sexual trivia book?  Oh, is that it?  Sexual trivia book.  Book.  That's a pamphlet.  All right.  For his eyes only.  Oh, give me the his.  You take the hers, bitch. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, boy.  You want me to read some of these questions?  Yeah, please.  Would you like to?  All right.  Yeah, throw it for hers.  I was only two.  Let's see how awful the advice is.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, Anthony wanted it.  No, he didn't.  Jimmy, get it.  You wanted Anthony?  I'll give it to you.  No.  I want one of those red things.  What's that?  On average, how many couples are having sex in the world at any given moment?  I would say, let's see.  Where are the answers, Stan?  Hopefully they're upside down in the back.  Two hundred and fifty million people. 
[02:24:00]  Nope.  Let me guess.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  On average, how many couples are having sex in the world at any given moment?  If you said 100 million, you are correct.  I said 250 million.  So you're very over, so I win because you were over.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Here we go.  I was only off by 100 million.  You were off by 150 million.  True.  I'm better.  How much is that in batches? 
[02:24:30]  He said 17, and he's closer?  I said 17 couples, and I won by a landslide.  You did this research.  Yeah.  I won by 50 million.  You did?  Wow.  According to the Great Sex Survey, what are men putting down their pants in the morning  to turn on women in the evening?  A wallet?  Anti-onion smell?  Baby powder.  Oh, see?  I'm closer.  Ask more questions.  Let's play the game.  I want to go around the board and watch. 
[02:25:00]  I don't want to.  It's like Candyland.  You slide down into a barren uterus.  Poop shoots and ladders.  What part of the U.S. boasts the highest percentage of women who masturbate regularly?  What's that?  What part of the U.S. boasts the highest percentage of women who masturbate regularly?  I'm going to guess the cunt.  West Coast, South, or Northeast?  I would say Northeast.  No. 
[02:25:30]  Give me a bail.  Did I get a buzzer, too?  North?  You got a buzzer on there somewhere, I think.  I want to guess.  Northeast.  Northeast for Anthony.  Northeast for Anthony.  So I get to open up one of the...  No.  No.  I'm just opening these random willy-nilly.  Wait, but everyone has to guess because...  You know how Laura hates when we open up her things?  Yeah.  I'm opening up barely legal.  Slave time I have.  This is going to be easy.  Pearl necklace or your best strand of beads?  Have you ever been given a pearl necklace before?  No, not that kind.  Getting out of your mind, out of the gutter. 
[02:26:00]  I mean, a real pearl necklace.  A luminescent bunch of beads.  Well, now you can use your pearls to remind him what kind of a lady you are.  Wind a string of pearls around his erection and tug.  Use the smooth, lovely strand to pull his penis toward your waiting mouth.  Grasp one end of the strand in each hand and slide it left then right, spinning one or two gleaming loops against his shaft in a snug spiral. 
[02:26:30]  Rub it up and down frenetically to really whip him into a fever pitch.  Twirl high and low, fast and slow, massaging his erection with a hundred tiny fingers and two warm lips.  Diamonds are a girl's best friend, but your guy just fell in love with pearls.  Matt from New York City.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Matt from New York City wants to know if the game's called Hungry Hungry Nymphos. 
[02:27:00]  Wait, this is a good one, too.  It's called Slave Time.  And it says, congratulations, you have not only won this game, you have just won the special grand prize.  Your new mate owes you an hour of slave time.  For the next 60 minutes, you can ask her to do anything.  Obviously, there's no pain.  So how to start?  Get black spray paint.  Make her lift her gums and show you her teeth. 
[02:27:30]  Make her sleep in the basement and throw up the par at your feet her.  Then fuck her and beat her for seducing you.  I got another question for you guys.  Pop culture.  Who said, I need sex like I need food?  Was it Madonna, Monica Lewinsky, or Barbara Streisand?  I say Karen Carpenter.  That would be Barbara Streisand.  Fail.  That's correct. 
[02:28:00]  Sissy.  New Babs.  I just guessed.  Which sexy lingerie do nine out of ten men say they like best?  A noose.  Garrett in a cowboy hat.  It's A, a silk teddy, B, garter and belt stockings, C, a dress shirt and panties. 
[02:28:30]  Dress shirt and panties?  What is she in a fucking brute commercial?  Oh, Jesus.  That's awful.  Dress shirt and panties.  And a mullet.  I don't know.  I say thigh highs.  Thigh highs, what was the other one?  A dress shirt and panties.  Oh, that's the only choice?  Two?  Yeah.  Who wants a teddy?  Yeah, yeah.  Thigh highs.  Fucking, who wants the teddy, the Mary Jo chick?  No way.  Stop.  Stop.  Don't even press that.  What?  No. 
[02:29:00]  A dress shirt and panties?  That would have been the answer.  You know what I would love to see a woman wearing?  One of these.  Oh, very nice.  Right in her face.  Wear that.  Ah, this is, uh, uh, there is only one animal along with humans that has sex for pleasure.  Name that animal.  Ugh.  Oh.  Yeah, there's so many.  Um.  I say that it's going to be the, uh. 
[02:29:30]  What?  Um.  Uh, the sea urchin.  Sex for pleasure?  Yeah.  I would have to say the chimpanzee.  The gorilla.  The fucking.  A whale.  A dolphin.  The dolphin.  Fuck.  Wow.  I know I should have went in that direction.  Uh.  Sexual oddity. 
[02:30:00]  If you're in bed with a Z-E-L-I-O-philiac.  And I watch.  Zileophilic.  Zileophilic.  You already know what the answer is.  What are you in, uh, what are you in for tonight?  A lot of Zileo.  Zileophilic.  Whipped cream, leather, or jealousy?  Uh.  Whipped cream.  Jealousy.  Jealousy.  One right, one wrong. 
[02:30:30]  Just agree to disagree.  Jimmy.  Well, I think it's Z-E-A-L, right?  Z-E-A-L.  Uh.  It's jealousy.  You're right.  Aw.  You're good.  All right.  Whatever.  Should we, uh.  Uh.  Men love bad girls part one.  Get his attention.  This is what you need.  One part lady.  One part slut.  And one cell phone.  Go to the bedroom and call from your cell phone.  Ahem.  Ahem.  Hi, baby.  I was just thinking about you.  I was thinking about going down on you right now. 
[02:31:00]  Would you like that?  Men love bad girls part two.  Turn him into a blubbering idiot and sexual servant.  Ooh.  I just touched myself and I'm so wet.  Why don't you come down here to the bedroom?  Down here to the bedroom.  Men love bad girls part three.  Get anything you want.  I need you inside me.  In my mouth.  Please put it in me.  I need to feel it so bad.  Part three. 
[02:31:30]  He might be speechless.  But don't let that stop you from talking like the wicked dirty girl you secretly are.  That's what you're going to open up if you get five fucking...  Got another question for you.  You got to answer five...  Whoa!  Question.  A cell phone from this nudge.  You don't need to call.  Especially like they don't tell you what his response is.  Like she'll call and go, I'm down here.  I need you inside me.  And he's like, look, I'm upstairs molesting our daughter.  Can I get back to you? 
[02:32:00]  According to...  Goes to voicemail.  According to...  Ruins our whole fucking sexual moment.  If you'd like to suck his cock, press one.  Hello.  Hi, I'm so fucking horny.  I'd like to...  Please leave a message.  When you hear the tone, I'll try to get back to you.  If this is about sucking my cock, press one.  According to a recent survey, what two words do men want to hear most from their lovers in bed?  I'm dead. 
[02:32:30]  Where's Adam?  Right.  A little appropriate.  I'm sick.  That hurts. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, dad.  What is the emergency kiss?  The emergency kiss?  You kiss the open palm of your lover's hand, then roll up the fingers, making a fist.  Oh.  Then say, put this up your cunt. 
[02:33:30]  Is it open to this in case of emergency?  Yeah.  Exactly.  How about the emergency load?  Are you shitting me?  Jerk off into her hand.  You kiss her palm, and then you close it into a fist, and you say, bring this to your hot  girlfriend, and slap it on our cunt.  Oh, wow.  It's funny.  What can a woman put in her mouth to engorge a man's penis and increase his pleasure during 
[02:34:00]  oral sex?  A shotgun.  A log?  All right.  What was the answer? 
[02:34:30]  I don't know.  My fingers were his bag?  Shit.  Warm liquid.  Which of the following fantasies is the most common among men?  A three-way, being dominated, or being tied up?  It's got to be the three-way, but that's too obvious, so it's going to be something that  isn't really true, which is something like being tied up.  I say being dominated.  Men are dominant in life all day.  Jimmy.  Jimmy with being dominated.  Yeah, but I know about men.  I don't know about women.  Let's see. 
[02:35:00]  Smart.  Oh.  Ew.  Jimmy's like as smart with cock as I am with aircraft.  Well, here's a great pop culture question.  Who said a man might forget where he lives, but he never forgets oral sex, no matter how  bad it is?  Reagan?  Steve C.  Steve C.?  Was it Cher?  Barbara Bush? 
[02:35:30]  Or Madonna?  Oh, it was a girl.  That's got to be Madonna.  Oh.  All right.  Shut the fuck up.  What the line?  Who's fucking...  Who's evaluating these for accuracy?  That bitch could write anything she wants.  Let's see.  There might be some girl ones we could do, because we're down from a men's point of view.  Should everyone?  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  Jimmy's got the girl's book.  Oh, good.  Where's the answers?  They're at the bottom of the page.  Sure they are.  I'm going to suck off so I can't get the fucking answer.  I'm trying to open these fucking stupid things.  They're impossible.  Leading question.  What does Cupid dip the tips of arrows in before star-crossed lovers?  Arsenic.  Robert Reed's stool sample.  Very good at. 
[02:36:30]  Here's a Petri dish of liquefied shit.  Dip, dip, dip, dip.  What percentage of adults play with sex toys on a regular basis?  Percentage?  Less than 10, 20 to 30%.  C, 50%.  I would say 50%.  50% plus.  Good job, Ant.  Do I get to answer one of these? 
[02:37:00]  I don't care.  Who invented the peep show in 1894?  Charles D. Peep.  This is a surprise, actually.  What year?  1894.  1894.  Thomas Hedison.  Actually, it was Thomas Edison.  No way.  Yeah, who knew that?  Thomas Hedison.  Thomas Hedison. 
[02:37:30]  Did not know that.  I'm reading these, and they're all just...  Look, in the hot seat.  That's a sexual thing to do if you win.  Ingredients.  An armless chair or stool.  I hope she means a seat.  Not for Jimmy.  Nothing sexy to the woman who knows exactly what she wants. 
[02:38:00]  You're running the show with this seduction, and never let your man forget that.  Place an armless chair or a stool in the middle of the bedroom, better yet, in the middle of the kitchen or the backyard.  Order him to sit down, and while he's seated, walk around him slowly, removing one item of clothing with each revolution.  His head will be turning 360 degrees.  After you're naked, walk over to him and start removing his clothes.  Rip his shirt off so the buttons fly across the room.  Kiss a line down the center of his chest all the way downtown.  When he's hard and ready, put him inside you.  Wrap your legs around him. 
[02:38:30]  This is your show, ladies.  So take control.  Pump him into submission.  He'll never be able to look at the chair the same way again.  That's stupid.  The armless chair, the only one you have is the Fisher-Price one that your kid does with fucking little Easy Bakes toys on.  You can't fit in it.  It works for gay couples.  You just turn the stool over.  That old gag.  Invite over three friends. 
[02:39:00]  All right, survey says, when do most men see women as being at their very sexiest?  Don't say fucking when they're pregnant.  While she's cooking?  After a shower?  When she's on all fours?  When do most men see women as being at their very sexiest?  When, right after a shower.  I'm going to say D, after anal sex, when you're wiping your shit-covered dick in a towel. 
[02:39:30]  You can't add your own answers, Jimmy.  You can.  I was co-author of this.  Hey, what happened to the phones?  Did everyone go away, or did we blow up the phones again?  No ring-a-ding-a-dingy.  We're getting no phone calls?  No, that usually means we're on to something, hopefully.  That means the phone's blew up.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Who cares?  We're on.  Who cares?  What percentage of women admit to shaving their pubic hair? 
[02:40:00]  25, 45, or 65?  65.  What age, though?  10.  45%.  That's who cares.  If a woman is known as a buckle bunny, what does she enjoy doing?  Just collapsing under pressure.  Dressing in a bunny suit, putting marshmallows in his mouth, and sticky wax up his asshole. 
[02:40:30]  Wait, what is she known as a...  A buckle bunny.  Uh, um, it's either getting hit with a belt, or, um, or, um, she's, uh, almost black.  Give me a hand.  In the whole wide world, there's nothing sexier than a woman who's half-dressed and completely aroused.  Hand him a candle, already lit.  Tell him to meet you in the bathroom in five minutes. 
[02:41:00]  When he walks in, he may stop breathing for a moment.  You're in one of his white button-downs, every button undone.  With your laciest, sexiest panties peeking out, your bare skin is glowing by the candlelight.  A wicked smile on his face.  You're wearing one of his business shirts.  And, honey, all, you're all business.  It's a fantasy come to life.  A scene he'll never forget.  Now, ravish, ravish him?  In the soft light.  Rip his shirt off.  Push him against the wall and wrap your legs around him tightly.  Or maybe you want to shove him into the shower, soap up your breasts, and let him fondle your exquisite wet form. 
[02:41:30]  Show him that life with you is always fun, often unpredictable, and getting better all the time.  That's funny.  When he walks in the bathroom, he won't be able to breathe because you're shitting.  So now hand him a match to get the smell out of it.  Have him light the candle with a match to get the smell out of the bathroom.  That's right.  Take my shirt off, bitch.  Let him gently wipe your shitty ass with the toilet paper.  With the tail of his own shirt. 
[02:42:00]  The tail of his business shirt.  And then have him smell it.  Let him stick a finger up your shitter after you've taken a dump so the smell of you will linger on him for a week straight.  Let him soap up your one good remaining breast.  Oh, my God.  That's this one called the Olivia Newton-John.  All right, hold on.  Here we go.  According to surveys, which sexual position do men prefer most? 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  This is terrible.  According to surveys, which sexual position do men prefer most?  Uh-huh.  Oh, there's no multiple choice?  Um, I was hoping for an answer, D.  Oh, okay.  Sexual position.  Well, I'll give you what they got. 
[02:43:00]  A, man on top.  B, woman on top.  C, man from behind.  D, looking nervously over his shoulder in a coffin.  Which day in a woman's 28-day cycle is she the most sexually aggressive and attractive to the opposite sex? 
[02:43:30]  Ah.  Um.  In 28 days?  Which one is she most sexually attractive?  I don't know.  Yeah, it don't matter.  Uh, what do guys fantasize about more?  Nude women.  Women in lingerie.  Women in stilettos.  Or, uh, D, a feminine boy holding a cat.  Women in a blue tarp. 
[02:44:00]  In a rowboat.  So, like, stupid fucking staged, like.  The only thing sexy than being naked is being nearly naked.  But swathed in the smooth fabric imaginable.  Silk on the skin.  There's nothing like it.  Walk into the bedroom wearing a silk scarf around your neck and woven into your hair tied around your waist. 
[02:44:30]  Whatever.  Uh, and nothing else.  Your man will be all hot and bothered immediately.  Probably be bothered.  I know.  Hey, Amelia Earhart, what are you doing?  She's on a period.  She's on a period, so he calls her the Red Baron.  Or she's had a hysterectomy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, take the scarf off, tie it around the base of his erect penis, and then take, uh. 
[02:45:00]  The other end tied to the bumper.  The bottom of his erect penis.  Unless he's busy working security.  Now add some gentle friction.  Slide the loop around slower, then faster.  A little looser, a little snug.  Do you know how fucking, that's like a, that's the Indian way to make fire.  Right, you're starting a fire.  Like a fucking rubbing silk scarf on your cock like that. 
[02:45:30]  God damn.  Dick will look like that Vietnamese girl getting napalms running down the street.  Are you ready?  Oh, yeah, I'm done with that one.  All right.  How can you get an adrenaline boost that'll wake you up for sex?  I got a stable three times.  Give it a shot.  Watch a scary movie.  Uh-huh.  Drink coffee.  Do kreggle exercises.  Kreggle. 
[02:46:00]  Is that it?  Mm-hmm.  An adrenaline boost.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to say watch a scary movie.  So you watch a scary movie, and then you want to fuck.  My girlfriend and I were watching The Exorcist yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  And she's a scaredy cat.  Yeah.  And we're watching it, and it's like really getting scary, like when fucking Meryn shows  up at the house.  Yeah, pretty creepy.  And she's fucking grabbing my hand, going, touch my ass.  And she's trying to put my hand on her puss.  Really?  Yeah.  And I'm like, no.  Watch this scary movie.  She was just trying to distract from her terror. 
[02:46:30]  That's all I was.  I like when little 12-year-old Reagan comes out and pisses on the carpet.  How do you not like that?  That makes me shoot my load right there.  She's going to die up there.  Fat.  A hole in one.  What could this one be?  I'm going to open this up.  Which of the following is true about kissing?  A, it can relieve headaches.  B, it reduces plaque.  It helps unclog pores. 
[02:47:00]  This game fucking stinks.  When is she coming on?  Guess what you want your partner to do?  Lick the food off your teeth.  Reduces plaque.  Sometimes I'll ask my girlfriend to lift her gums up.  I'll just snake my tongue under her gums and lick her perientitis.  Look at the ingredients for this one.  A short skirt.  One miniature golf course.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  What is it?  How to seduce that Moxley girl? 
[02:47:30]  Take him out in an especially arousing game of miniature golf.  After you pay for the game and collect your equipment, excuse yourself for a trip to the ladies room.  When you come back, hand him the golf ball.  Hand him a golf ball wrapped in your panties.  I think I came up with a way to make the game a little more interesting, honey.  Take your turn first.  You practice with the same skirt in front of a mirror so you know exactly how to bend and place your ball to give him the best view. 
[02:48:00]  When it's his turn, stroll over to the hole while he sets up his shot and crouch down behind it with your knees just slightly apart.  Tease him all across the course with one little flash after another.  How much should you expose?  Let me put it this way.  If he doesn't send a ball flying out into the parking lot, you're not showing him enough.  Or express surprise when a gopher hides in your pussy. 
[02:48:30]  Try to queef real hard and get the windmill spinning.  What if there's other people at this fucking place?  Children go to miniature golf.  And you notice him winding up and hitting the ball really hard, trying to mash it into your box.  Daddy, I just got a hole-in-one in hole seven, and my ball smells like trout. 
[02:49:00]  That is ridiculous.  Someone spilled clam chowder on my ball.  Daddy, the hole on hole number seven isn't round.  It's shaped like a toothless mouth.  Nightypuss.  Spring break. 
[02:49:30]  Twice the spice.  Stroke of genius.  Let's see that.  What?  I got to open up this one.  All I'm thinking.  What is it called?  It's called Stroke of Genius, Jim.  What could it possibly be?  Ingredients.  Dip clark. 
[02:50:00]  A lot of salt.  And Dr. Cuckoo.  Dr. Cuckoo.  Dr. Cuckoo.  And a lot of salt.  Dr. Cuckoo.  Dr. Cuckoo.  Wouldn't that be ironic?  Oh, I'm in a very silly mood.  Yes.  When people follow a superstition and honk their horns at a newly married couple, it ensures  a long marriage, many children, or grades. 
[02:50:30]  Or sex.  Or D, an ugly limo ride in Long Island.  Oh, my God.  D, you're going down the wrong way on the parkway.  Mommy will soon.  No.  See, great sex.  Great sex.  I would never say that.  It's horrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  How'd your parents die?  Got any more over there, Ant? 
[02:51:00]  Here you go.  Here's some more cards.  Uh-oh, yeah.  I got a few over here.  Where's the spice?  Guy world.  What can Guy world be?  Man's, um...  They don't open well.  They're not perforated.  These aren't perforated properly.  What's that gentleman with the camera?  Leading question.  In the female superior position, what can a woman do to burn more calories? 
[02:51:30]  Stan said vomit.  A female superior?  Is that her on top, I would assume?  Squat and bounce while you're having sex.  Yeah, bounce up and down to burn more calories.  Not just sit there.  What the fuck does she want?  Right.  Two hot adult DVDs, one hot pizza, one cold six-pack.  Welcome to Guy world. 
[02:52:00]  Gather all the ingredients for a male fantasy paradise.  Beer, pizza, and porn.  You won't be alone.  40% of X-rated video customers are women.  Dress sexy, but not in the Victoria's Secret way.  Instead, put on the Guy world hottie classic, a white T-shirt, and cutoffs.  That's not...  I know.  Think Daisy Duke goes to Hooters.  Make him comfortable.  Feed him.  Watch some TV.  Burn, but turn up the heat.  Kiss him after each bite.  That's good.  That shitty dry pizza breath you get. 
[02:52:30]  Lactose.  Make out during commercials.  After dinner, unveil your special surprise.  A couple of DVDs full of hot, serious X-rated sex.  Get bolder as the video gets wilder.  Play with yourself while he watches.  Duplicate the on-screen action.  Tonight, you are the hottest thing in all of Guy world.  Tonight, he'll be the horse.  His own personal porn star with an insatiable appetite and a bottle of lubricant.  Of course, back in girl world, you might be walking funny the next day. 
[02:53:00]  Because he chopped your legs off when you were done.  It's just so stupid that they don't understand, like, give him beer and pizza  and then try to seduce him when he's in a blackout and shitting.  Hey, this brings us around to the beginning of the show.  Oh, that was called the Mrs. McCartney because you're walking funny the next day.  This brings us back to the beginning of the show.  For a real thrill, how do you directly stimulate a man's prostate gland? 
[02:53:30]  I think everyone knows this but doesn't want.  You stick a finger up his ass.  Is it A, finger?  B, toe?  Toe.  C, a penis ring.  If you stick a toe up his ass.  If any girl ever tried to stick a toe up my ass, seriously.  I don't mean just playing around in bed.  Well, you threw out that fucking amendment to the proposition quickly.  To the constitution.  You put out that little asterisk quickly.  Kidding, of course.  You ever jab at your loved one with your foot, though? 
[02:54:00]  You know?  You kind of get in the crack of their ass.  You kind of wiggle your toes.  And they go,  Woo!  Whee!  That's always fun.  Well, yeah, it's a finger.  Is it safe to try to get out of bed at your place?  Is it like one of those same things when you go,  Oh, I got to get out of bed.  Go downstairs to get something or take a leak or something.  What are you getting at?  You just play the grab the ass game or finger in the crack game. 
[02:54:30]  It's hysterical.  You get up and then it's like,  Woo!  It's funny.  All right.  I'm looking for more questions here.  What do you need here?  One kitty groomed in wax and lots of confidence.  Some in like legs.  Some go for breasts.  Some are all about the butt.  But every guy is turned on by confidence. 
[02:55:00]  What?  And there's nothing hotter than a woman with the kind of sexual self-assurance that you're about to display.  Grab his collar.  Plant a kiss on his lips and whisper your instructions.  Get naked and get in bed right now.  Dim the lights and put on the kind of music that makes you dance.  Shove him onto his back and straddle him.  Wiggle your way up past his chest and shoulders.  Grab the headboard and keep that pretty little puss hovering over his face, dancing all the while.  It's a lap dance, but a hundred times better because it's a lap dance on his tongue. 
[02:55:30]  He sure ain't going to be getting that from anywhere else.  Tease him for as long as you can.  Hold out without letting him taste you.  Oh, so you hover over there and be a real fucking cunt about it.  After he has enjoyed the view for a minute...  What is it?  This burrow's walking their way down.  After he's enjoyed the view for a minute, it's time to let him know.  Make him please you with his tongue. 
[02:56:00]  And don't be shy.  Let him know how much you enjoy his skills.  Every moan and gasp means he's doing it right.  You might even say,  Perfect.  Get it, the puss...  This isn't good enough to even throw in the garbage.  It's awful.  Right before you, period.  Hover over his face.  Drop a maraschino cherry on his chin.  Apologize.  Make sure you're at the clotting face. 
[02:56:30]  Just throw this around the room.  That is...  Yeah, just put it there.  Whatever show comes on after us here.  Whatever show.  Hey, what's this here, Fez?  Brian and Fez will probably do four hours on this and be fucking brilliant.  Of course.  On two cards.  Two cards.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sam, coming up, Roland movie reviews.  Yes.  What's he reviewing this time?  The new James Bond movie is out.  What's Roland's take on it? 
[02:57:00]  Find out.  The only way to do that is by sticking around.  No.  Okay.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Sam, explain to the listening audience who may or may not know, who is Roland and what  does he do for the program?  Well, Roland is our talent booker and he's very good at booking guests for the show.  He returned to the show after an absence and you can see we're getting better guests all  the time, all thanks to Roland.  But what Roland doesn't have is the gift of being a great communicator. 
[02:57:30]  And this leads to one of our favorite segments that we like to do with Roland is have him  review movies.  This was when James Bond Casino Royale was out and Roland came in to give his take on  it.  When we could understand what he was saying, it was hilarious.  That James Bond was in the movie.  When we couldn't understand what he was saying, it was even better.  It's Roland reviewing James Bond Casino Royale.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Is Roland here, by the way?  He certainly is with his medium shirt. 
[02:58:00]  Everyone is saying you have to watch a video to see that thing fall over.  Well, Roland decided to do a, what's the deal with the Steve C. impressions?  Why is everyone saying, oh my God, out there, huh?  I thought it was Eric, though.  He was making commercials.  Can you do Steve C. impressions?  I was like, I guess.  You weren't asked to do a Steve C. impression?  Yeah.  You can't even do a you impression.  Why do you look so fresh-faced today?  I don't know.  Did you get a haircut?  There's something different about you.  You did.  He got a haircut. 
[02:58:30]  But he looks all fresh-faced.  I slept.  Did you tan?  No, I slept all weekend.  Yeah.  But you're all clean-shaven and fresh-faced.  Yeah.  Your skin has a glow to it.  It does.  You get a facial.  Did you exfoliate?  No.  What did you do to your face?  Nothing.  It's shiny.  Yes, you did something.  You did something.  No, no.  Did you polish your face with cum?  No.  That's what we're getting at, yes.  No.  All right.  Soap.  So, E-Rock.  Oh, wow. 
[02:59:00]  Pops right in.  He certainly does.  That E-Rock, he knows.  Bad sitcom character.  What's the Roland thing all about?  We needed some extra material for the variety hour, and we were doing a bunch of Steve C.  segments.  So I thought we'd get everybody in and do their Steve C. impersonation.  So why can't we hear everybody's?  Yeah.  Because Roland's was actually the best out of all of them.  Everyone else was just kind of generic.  Doing the Jimmy impression of Steve that everyone does.  That's right.  People just pick up other people's impressions of Steve.  Yes.  Steve even does an impression of me doing him. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  But it just sounds like him.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm doing you doing me.  No, you're doing you.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Here's Roland doing Steve C. Let's get right into it.  And now on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour, Roland tries to do his Steve C. impression.  Hi, this is Steve C. You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  I can go to the dry cleaners to pick my leather Jager jacket.  Yahoo.  Holy.  Yahoo.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[03:00:00]  Uh.  Uh.  Grrr.  This is Steve C. You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  Has anybody seen my egg whites and potatoes?  Grrr.  There you go.  This is Steve C. You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  Why does my blackberry work?  Damn.  Poopo.  No, I got nothing.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Who is that, Steve C. or Woody Allen?  I heard the Woody Allen too, J. I was about to say that.  Woody Allen doing Steve C.  Oh.  It's having your hat blocked.  Ah, yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Steve C. impression's always funny, no matter who's doing it.  Steve.  Steve.  It's Steve.  See, people who don't know Steve, you can't see when he talks that his hands, like, what  did you say?  It looks like he's holding two giant bull balls in his hands and he's, like, jiggling them.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're out in front of him like he's carrying something.  But he has a weight in his hands.  Yes.  And we all know that weight is just a big secret.  And we all know it's no secret.  And he knows it too.  Steve, what's the matter?  I hurt my head.  I banged it onto a hanger this morning. 
[03:01:00]  I see.  Track two is the same thing.  Unbeat.  Oh, oh, I played the wrong version.  We're on XM.  Jesus.  Here it is again.  Roland doing Steve C.  And now, on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour, Roland tries to do his Steve C. impression.  Hi, this is Steve C.  You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  I'm going to go to the dry cleaners to pick my leather Jager jacket.  Yahoo.  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[03:01:30]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Grr.  This is Steve C.  You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  Has anybody seen my egg whites and potatoes?  Grr.  There you go.  This is Steve C.  You're listening to the Razzle Dazzle Hour.  Why does my blackberry work?  Damn.  Poop-oop.  No, I got nothing.  Oh, my God.  It's kind of funny, man.  Steve C.  Razzle Dazzle Hour.  That Razzle Dazzle's really taken off, hasn't it?  It sure has.  Mm-hmm.  Steve C. 
[03:02:00]  He's Razzle Dazzle.  Because he's so full of Razzle Dazzle.  And he's actually full of neither.  There's nothing Razzle-y about him, and he never dazzles you.  Never dazzles.  Yes.  No Razzle.  It should be Rullard Dullard.  Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  And then he's in the booth just shaking his head like, you ass.  You're an asshole.  Looking at his blackberry.  Why isn't this working?  Whenever it's uncomfortable, he just looks up at the blackberry.  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  Same three emails.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll. 
[03:02:30]  Love him.  Hey, you see any movies this weekend, Razzle?  No.  I was feeling sick this weekend, so I just stayed in.  Honey, what's the matter?  Len?  Scratchy throat?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  That's what I had.  Crap.  Then I just stayed in and took, like, Robitussin, like, well, and just passed out.  That's what I use.  Did you rub it on your chest?  No.  They have a new thing where you're tossing your shower, like, tablets, and it vapors.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's a great idea.  What the fuck is that about? 
[03:03:00]  I don't know.  I saw it.  What kind of cancer is that going to give you in a few years?  Do you think so?  It's like glenery, though.  It can't be good.  You're breathing it in.  How do you do it, though?  I don't know.  It's like a tablet.  You turn on the hot water.  Oh, it's like a what?  Tablets.  Okay.  I hear you.  And you put it in your shower, and you turn on the hot water.  Where in the shower?  That's what I'm getting at.  I don't know.  Wherever the water gets.  I want to go down the drain.  That's where I have the drain cover.  It comes out of the fucking faucet.  It comes out of the shower head.  Yeah.  It was invented by Germans.  It's called Cyclone B, you idiot.  It'll cure whatever ails you, though. 
[03:03:30]  I'll tell you that much.  It works well.  Explain it.  It's like I just put the tablet in the shower, turn on the hot water.  Where in the shower?  Just on the floor?  Yeah, on the floor, wherever the water hits.  How big is the tablet?  That big.  Radio.  About a 50 cent piece?  Yeah, 50 cent piece.  50 cent.  A 50 cent piece.  All right.  And you throw it on the floor, like an Alka-Seltzer.  Like an Alka-Seltzer, and then when you turn on the Vicks vapor.  Do you see like a vapor coming out of this thing?  No, do you see?  Does scary smoke come up to you?  No, you just smell the strong Vicks. 
[03:04:00]  In the steam of the shower?  Is your shower enclosed?  Yeah.  See, I have a shower, but it's got a curtain that's not enclosed.  I want to get an enclosed one with a glass.  Then you can do that shit.  Mine is completely enclosed, and it is made of marble.  You're rich.  And it's got a glass door on the front that when it shuts, you're completely closed in.  It has eight jets on the walls and a huge rain one on the ceiling, and one that you can grab and you can put on your ball sack and clean underneath your undercarriage. 
[03:04:30]  Do you have a—why don't you have a—I'm surprised you don't have a little steam room in your bathroom.  Like, you could do that in a steam shower.  I love steam.  Well, you know something?  This thing might as well be a steam bath because—a steam shower because you could turn the water up so hot.  And it's set by temperature.  I could set it to 110 degrees or 111 degrees if I want.  Do you go that high?  And there's a bench in there.  With the water?  Yeah.  Sometimes you'd crank it up to 110, and there's a bench in there. 
[03:05:00]  Your body's all pink.  You're just, like, cooked.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  You got a pink bottom.  Looks like you were just spanked all over for being bad.  It's wonderful.  And then you get out, and my floor is heated so my tootsies don't get cold.  Ew.  I like to smash your tootsies with a fucking—I like to hit your toes the way you would take a brick and hit those little caps.  Remember those little red caps?  You have to pop them with the corner of a rock to make them fucking pop.  Who wouldn't?  Especially when your feet are—there's nothing worse than cold toes being smashed by something. 
[03:05:30]  Like a good hammer claw running your fucking half-frozen tootsies.  My whole fucking life I spent with that goddamn shower curtain sucking in on me for some reason.  Every time I took a shower, that fucking shower curtain would blow in and, like, stick to your leg.  What is with that?  I don't know.  Mine doesn't do that because it's a heavier plastic.  Shower curtains.  Ugh.  I want to get the door.  Enough.  All right.  Let's go to Tom in Tennessee.  Tom. 
[03:06:00]  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, uh, yeah.  I love those, uh, tablets.  Shooter care, man.  You put them in your shower, you're congested.  Yeah, I'm—I'm snotted up all over my chest using them.  They're beautiful.  Does it just start leaking out of your head?  Just leaking everywhere.  Wow.  It clears you out real quick.  Never—never even heard of this.  No.  I just saw Dwayne Reed.  I just—  Dwayne Reed.  When I was a kid, they used to—because I always had bad—my whole life had bad nose and bad  sinuses.  They would rub on my chest. 
[03:06:30]  Vicks, uh, what was it called?  Vapo rub.  Vapo rub.  Yeah, they would rub that creamy stuff on my chest.  And I would always—  Ooh, jism?  Yes.  My father would apply it.  It would hit my hair.  No, I would—I would put it on my chest.  I would lift my little shirt.  And I would put my nose under my shirt.  Oh, and breathe in the nice vicks.  And breathe in the fumes.  Yeah.  Hey, does anybody remember when I was a kid, my grandmother, her magical cure for everything  was ST-37.  The fuck is she?  It came in a blue bottle.  Alien.  And it was a distant—it was like an antiseptic. 
[03:07:00]  It would, like, clean out your cuts and stuff.  It was called ST-37.  ST—  Maybe somebody out there heard me.  We could have a fun chat about ST-37.  My nan, her big cure for everything topical was, uh, Noxzema.  Noxzema.  And whenever I'd get, you know, huge zits, she'd be like, put some Noxzema on.  I'm like, yeah, Grammy.  That's what I need.  Some moisturizer on a zit.  Because that's what—you don't want to dry it out, God forbid. 
[03:07:30]  Dolt.  Let's say hi to Jeff and Tessie.  Oh, we lost Jeff.  You know my grandmother's cure for attention?  My grandmother's cure for attention was she'd spit in her hand and pull down your little  PJ bottoms and spit all over your hairless cock and then jerk you off.  And get you to sleep.  She wouldn't suck it, though.  That'd be incest.  Jesus.  Like, come on, just pop it in your mouth, Nana.  And she'd go, oh, you, you're fresh.  Fucking halfway, Nana.  Come on.  Finish the job.  So, so you didn't see any movies? 
[03:08:00]  You didn't rent any movies?  Nothing, right?  No.  All right.  See that James Bond?  Yes.  And?  You liked it, right?  Yeah, I loved it.  Oh, we got his review.  It was god-awful.  You're a big Bond fan, right?  Um, not really.  Awful?  Oh, his review was awful.  No, listen to his review again.  What's your review of Casino Royale?  It was good.  I mean, it had action, suspense.  Suspense.  Suspense.  Suspense.  Suspenders.  Action and suspenders. 
[03:08:30]  Suspense.  Suspense.  What else?  Twists.  Surprises.  Twists.  Twists.  Turns.  Surprises.  Turns.  Intrigues.  Intrigue.  What else, dude?  Jesus, you're in the business.  I know, I just...  That's what you expect from a James Bond movie.  I told you, he's the...  What makes this better than all the other Bond films you've seen over the years?  God, that's a great point, Dan, brought up.  Roland reviews movies like a trailer from the 50s. 
[03:09:00]  Action.  Suspense.  Intrigue.  Twists.  Turns.  Whenever he talks, big white letters should pop out of his mouth the way they would in  an Ed Wood trailer.  And spell it out.  Yeah, you're a 50s movie trailer.  You stink.  All right, keep going.  Just a different Bond, a better actor.  I mean, he's really good.  Kept the old Bond making stuff. 
[03:09:30]  What?  Oh, my God.  What?  Wow.  Bond, you see him get his little gadget or something.  You see him get his little gadget?  What does that mean?  What does it even mean?  Why?  Why?  What gadget?  I don't know.  His Bond gadget?  His Bond gadget?  What the hell is his Bond gadget?  That could be a million things. 
[03:10:00]  Go see the movie.  Go see the movie.  Like he's in it and wants people to show up.  Like he's got fucking points on the movie.  Producer, Roland.  So you understand we're using you to get some reviews out there for some of these hot flicks  and then the listener will decide if they want to see it.  Right.  Yeah.  So that's why you got to like really sell it here.  Based on your review, I did not want to see that fucking movie.  And it turned out to be one of the best action movies and the best Bond movie I've ever seen.  Best Bond movie.  What was your favorite part? 
[03:10:30]  Roland.  The boat scene.  Well, you'd see him in the car and then the boat.  For me.  Car and then the boat.  Were they on the fucking Staten Island Ferry going to work?  Oh my God.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  The car and then the boat.  I don't know.  It's...  It was a car chase and then it turned into a boat chase?  Yeah.  He seems to try to save Moneypenny.  Save Moneypenny? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  The girl.  It wasn't Moneypenny.  It was just the girl.  He kind of made a Moneypenny joke at the beginning, but that wasn't her name.  Yeah.  It was different.  You thought that girl was Moneypenny?  No, I said from the joke from the other Bonds where he used Moneypenny.  Yeah, but it was...  Reference.  Her name is...  She's different.  She's not Moneypenny.  Any other movies you're excited to see?  I've seen the Will Smith one tonight, The Pursuit of Happiness.  What is that about?  Just based on a true story.  What movie?  You lost me.  The Pursuit of Happiness. 
[03:11:30]  Will Smith plays this guy who's struggling with...  He's a single father and he walks up to the guy, how do you get that Ferrari?  And the guy goes, oh, I'm a stockbroker.  He goes, oh, I want to do that.  Then he goes, does it, makes a million dollars.  He's a millionaire now.  Is it a true story?  Yeah.  The end.  Oh, wow.  Does he end up driving around in a Ferrari at the end of the movie?  I don't know.  I've seen it tonight.  I don't know.  Possibly. 
[03:12:00]  Possibly?  Oh, good.  Questions.  Twists, turns, injury, possibly.  Kevin from...  Boat, car, scene.  Kevin from Connecticut, rolling, doing the news.  Murder, corruption.  And weather, sports.  Yeah.  He just blurts out words that just...  They're really not very descriptive.  I bet when he fights, he punches someone and pow comes off. 
[03:12:30]  Like, how?  Kablow.  We got Nino from...  Or Nino.  Nino from Jersey.  Nino.  Yeah, is this guy for real?  Yes.  Or is he, like, retarded or something?  Both.  He's real.  He's real.  And I've spoken to Roland off the air.  I don't think he's retarded.  But there's something about that microphone.  It's just...  He's incapable of putting together an idea and a sentence and conveying to the people, the listeners out there, what is going on in that head of his. 
[03:13:00]  Action.  Action.  First friend.  All right.  Thank you.  Yes.  Dog shit sniffer.  Just fix it up a little bit.  Roland also liked the boat scene in Titanic.  So...  Yeah.  The boat.  The boat.  How would you describe the Titanic movie to somebody?  Maybe someone that isn't familiar with the story. 
[03:13:30]  Wow.  A chip.  A what?  A chip.  A chip.  A chip.  A chip.  A chip.  Computer or potato.  Poncho or John, you idiot.  All right.  Or the big boat.  All right.  A chip.  A chip.  It goes sailing and...  Sailing.  Tragedy happens and the boat's sailing.  The boat sinks.  A little story between five and a half hours.  You'll pass out, wake up, and it's still sailing. 
[03:14:00]  But if the boat sinks, how is it still sailing?  Because...  They flashback.  The director's cut.  Director's cut.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  They flashback.  All right.  So that's the Titanic.  Here, another really famous movie.  Oh, Christ.  How about...  And you wore a shirt one day.  The Godfather.  Yeah.  I think he's done this one.  But how would you describe The Godfather?  Maybe someone's just moving to the country that's not familiar with our cinema.  How would you describe The Godfather to them? 
[03:14:30]  A group of Italians.  Mafia.  War ensues between families.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Backstabbing.  Again, more action.  Intrigue.  Intrigue.  Backstabbing.  Twists.  Turns.  Action.  Okay.  I want to know about this movie.  Have you ever seen Memento? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Could you please describe Memento to somebody who would never have seen it?  The end of the movie starts in the beginning.  It goes backwards.  So, everything happens in opposite order.  It's like seeing the movie backwards.  But what about him is interesting?  A Memento?  Yes.  He tattoos everything on his body to remember stuff.  Because there's no memory.  There's no memory. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  So, when he sleeps with a girl, he goes, oh, yeah, that's Sally.  Yeah.  Hey.  But it's all in backwards motion?  No.  I don't understand what you mean, backwards.  The ending is the beginning, and then the beginning is the ending of the movie.  How do they do that without it just being in backwards motion?  They just say, hey.  Keep on.  Oh, my God.  Hey, what?  All right.  Well, that's good enough.  I got either Lord of the Rings or the Star Wars trilogy. 
[03:16:00]  Which one would you like to tell someone that has never seen these movies before, believe  it or not?  Lord of the Rings, I guess.  You like Lord of the Rings?  Yeah.  Okay.  What could you tell someone that has never seen Lord of the Rings, what the movie's about?  Small little midgets walking for 10 hours looking for a ring, and then he finally finds  it, and then they sell on ships, and you're like, what?  Pretty much.  What?  What?  What?  What happens after he finds the ring?  He goes down to the dock, he hops on the boat with the ring, and you're like, oh. 
[03:16:30]  They sell on ships?  They all do.  Little midget chips.  Chips?  Chips or trips?  Chips.  They sell on chips.  They sell on chips?  But what was the ring?  You know, he has like a weird Mexican accent.  You're like, I Love Lucy, her husband, Ricky Retardo.  So, what was the ring?  Um, the power for, I forget the power, it's just like, so long, they just walk and walk. 
[03:17:00]  It was so long of them just walking and walking.  That's a strawberry looking fucking banana.  We'll have to see this, Kenny.  Might have to throw this at the wall.  A little too much strawberry, right?  It might be too much strawberry.  Too much strawberry.  All right, how about, uh, it's all right, Ant?  It'll suffice.  How about Jaws?  Uh, Jaws, it's been a while since I've seen that.  Um, a shark in the water.  Shark in the water.  Shark in the water.  So far, so good.  Scares people.  Scares people, good.  Scary.  Uh, Richard Dreyfuss goes out, tries to get the, the shark. 
[03:17:30]  All along?  No, with, um, the other guy, everybody forgets his name.  Mm-hmm.  Roy.  Roy, Roy, Roy.  Roy, Roy, Roy.  Rogers.  Okay.  Um, I don't remember his name, but they go out there trying to catch the shark.  Roy Scheider.  Two guys?  Roy Scheider, yeah.  Or a couple.  A couple, few guys?  Yeah.  Those characters aren't important, right?  Well, yeah, well, they're like the marine biologist type to see what the shark's activities. 
[03:18:00]  The owner of the ship?  The orca?  That, yeah.  Yeah.  What's he like?  Yeah.  I don't remember too much of the movie.  It's been a long time.  It's been a long time since I've seen it.  Wow.  I got a sore throat.  All right, what, how about one more good one?  Something basic.  Yeah.  Pulp Fiction.  Oh, that's a good one.  How about Pulp Fiction?  Come on, Pulp Fiction.  John Travolta's comeback movie.  It was a good movie.  It had action. 
[03:18:30]  Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious.  Action.  Hilarity.  Hilarity.  Killings.  Killing.  Murder.  Injury.  Twists and turns.  All right, what is it about?  They open the trunk and you see a gold light and whatever.  What?  I don't know.  It's been a while since I've seen that movie too.  It's just, they go out to do stuff.  They go out to do stuff? 
[03:19:00]  They go out to do stuff.  That's good.  That could be like Pulp Fiction or the sisterhood of the traveling pants.  Yeah.  What about a movie that everyone has seen?  Think of one good movie everyone has seen.  I need one good one.  Something you liked that you really enjoyed that you'd be able to describe to somebody because  you enjoyed it so much.  What's like some of your favorite movies of all time, Raiders of the Lost Ark? 
[03:19:30]  All right.  What movie?  Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Oh.  Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Yeah.  All right.  Describe that one.  Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones and he tries to find the Ark of the Covenant and he goes  to different places and he meets his friend Salah and whips people and shoots people. 
[03:20:00]  Whips and shoots people.  It's unbelievable.  Wow.  Was there a boat in Casino Royale?  People are saying there was no boat.  I was trying to think of what he was talking about, but yeah, I assume there's, there was  like a, but it was inconsequential.  It was like.  All right.  That's good for now.  I don't know.  Wow.  I would wish that if I had committed a crime, Roland was the only witness. 
[03:20:30]  Absolutely.  No kidding.  Because I could just, it was a guy.  A guy.  Bank.  Yes.  Money.  Getaway car.  Yeah.  What did he look like?  Legs.  Arms.  A head.  Menacing.  Scary.  Frightening.  Intrigue.  Action.  Adventure.  Is he nervous?  Yeah.  How much did he weigh?  He was, you know, like size of like a person. 
[03:21:00]  How much did he weigh?  Yes.  Yes.  He ran out.  What did he get into?  Ski mask.  It was a car.  A note.  What kind of car?  Wheels.  A grill.  A grill thing, maybe.  You know, and broom, broom away.  Sirens.  Okay.  Forget it. 
[03:21:30]  All right.  Roland was a little known fact.  I don't know.  You haven't really talked about this much on the show, but we all know that you used to  work for Carson Daly.  Yeah.  You did some personal stuff for him.  Mm-hmm.  A personal assistant.  A PA, right?  Yep.  And you also worked on his last call.  Yeah.  For a while.  And Sam got the tape from you?  Yeah.  Well, pretty much I knew.  I had to give it to him or else I'd be fired or I'd be raped.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Monsterjob.com. 
[03:22:00]  I got it from him.  Well, I asked him originally to bring me the tape.  Hi, Sam.  He was on Carson Daly's show, so I got the tape.  And I played it and found some funny stuff from it.  I'm from New York.  New York.  But I don't sound like it.  I sound like I'm from fucking Mars.  Sam's trying to clear his throat.  That ain't helping.  Sam, what can you tell us about Roland on Last Call with Carson Daly?  He was known as Roland the intern, the super intern. 
[03:22:30]  He ran everywhere.  He even ran to stage.  And they played keep rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  Wait, you ran?  Yeah.  He was what?  He came out and said he runs everywhere.  He was Roland the super intern who moves quickly.  Ew.  What happened?  You became fucking Roland the glacier who moves nowhere.  All right. 
[03:23:00]  And is there some good stuff here?  I believe there is.  All right.  So here's Roland on Last Call.  The first clip is Carson introduces Roland.  Listen for Roland's How You Doing?  Yeah.  We have this kid Roland.  He's the nicest guy in the world.  He's been on the show before.  We've had him up here.  Works his ass off.  He literally runs.  Anything we ask him to do, he runs.  Let me just bring it out.  Where's Roland?  Roland, come on out.  Moving very speedily, I see, there, as usual.  Yeah, always.  Yeah, you run, Dev.  You really do run everywhere.  Yeah, you run everywhere.  Yeah, that's great.  Are you still having a good time working on the show? 
[03:23:30]  I'm having a time in my life.  Yeah, are you really?  Yeah.  And you got your Ed shirt on there.  You're a fan of Julie Bowens on the program.  Big fan.  Big fan of Ed.  And Julie Bowens.  Would you like to meet her?  Maybe we can arrange that.  Yeah.  Yeah?  How you doing?  Yeah, right.  That was you saying, how you doing?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, yeah.  Oh, my God.  They wanted to hire somebody else, but Carson said, no, no, no, because I got a kid who'll fall  apart.  And you did. 
[03:24:00]  Hence, Jeff Zucker goes, who is he?  And now he goes, he's fine.  He goes, get camera crew here.  Fell apart.  He goes, all right, bring him in.  Yeah, they sent him to the Aspen Comedy Festival.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He interviews Mike Myers here?  Yes.  Let's see how he handles Mike Myers.  Wow.  Yeah.  That ought to be nerve-wracking.  Huh?  I had to wait four hours for him.  Makes the most of it.  Does he really?  No.  It was a longer interview, but Mike was like, he didn't want to do any interviews, but then  he goes, can I do an interview? 
[03:24:30]  He goes, yeah, you'll fall apart.  I was like, all right.  Oh.  What was he pushing during this?  Nothing.  He was just there to accept an award.  All right.  Here's Roland interviewing Mike Myers.  Hi, I'm Mike Myers.  I'm from Toronto, Canada, and I'm 5'7 1⁄2 and I'm a stocking tee.  Okay.  I was wondering if you could do, like, an Austin line, I could do a Fat Bastard line?  Okay.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, my little baby.  Yeah, it's pretty bad, huh?  That's great.  Yeah.  That's great.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, God, am I, I can't look at you. 
[03:25:00]  While he's doing this, Roland is wearing a funny hat that he bought at the beginning of  this segment.  It was me as a producer.  The interview was, like, four or five minutes, and then they took my fall in the park.  My little baby?  Yeah, what were you doing?  I did not want to do that.  Do you think he wanted to do an Austin Powers impression?  Oh, no, no.  He did not at all.  The producer goes, it'd be really funny.  We both looked at each other. 
[03:25:30]  It's going to be bad.  He goes, just do it.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Well, here's Roland interviewing Michael McKeon, and he can't remember his name.  No, after he introduces him, he has to look at the camera guy, or producer, whoever  it is, to make sure.  The what guy?  Camera guy.  Holy shit, did you say it really?  Camera.  Camera.  He had to look at the camera guy.  The camera guy.  I didn't pay attention.  New York.  All right, well, here's, and he forgot his name.  Yeah, he didn't know who he was.  Okay, here we go. 
[03:26:00]  All right, guy.  Hi, hanging behind the bell stand, again, with Michael McKeon.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I can show you my room key and everything.  Oh, no, that's all right.  Really me.  And then he asked him, with Michael McKeon?  Michael McKeon?  Michael McKeon?  Is that your name?  Oh, man.  Well, I had to interview Janine Garofalo, too.  Uh-oh.  That was my first one, and I was like, oh, I heard you're always bitter.  Just, like, joking.  Those producers, just say that.  She'll, like, think it's funny.  Oh, boy.  She went off on me for 10 minutes. 
[03:26:30]  It wasn't even aired?  No.  Oh, really?  No.  She was a cunt about it?  Oof.  Yeah, she just, like...  We have it?  No, it wasn't aired at all.  It wasn't aired.  It was, like...  Oh, it aired.  The only thing you see me seeing that I say, sorry.  She just ran away.  Yeah, there's just a clip of him shaking her hand.  It's not...  Oh, wow.  They wouldn't air it, though.  It just hurt.  What a cunt.  Oh, shit.  Ugh.  Roland interviews Kevin Smith and does a Chewbacca impression in this next clip.  Ow!  Ah.  Yeah, I heard you're a Star Wars fan.  I... 
[03:27:00]  No.  No.  No.  Not really.  Not really?  We're a trekker.  Trekker?  Trekker?  No, I like stars.  Yeah, I like stars.  Yeah, I liked you.  I thought you might want to know in college I won an impression for the best Chewbacca contest.  Did you?  Yeah.  Can I see it?  Laugh it up, fuzzball.  Oh, great.  Thanks.  That was pretty good.  Yeah, that's my Harrison Ford.  He just kept right going.  Kevin Smith's great, man.  Laugh it up, fuzzball.  Yeah. 
[03:27:30]  Johnny from Kansas.  Chew anything.  Yeah, no.  Johnny from Kansas.  It's like his movie review should be the $50,000 pyramid.  Action.  Yeah.  Murder.  Intrigue.  Boats.  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  But you get a producer saying, ask these questions.  I'm like, oh, God.  It would be great.  All right.  Wow.  You were a good boy, though.  Yeah.  You went in there and you're a go-getter.  Yeah.  We did a couple other ones, but like we did Kelsey Grammer in the bathroom. 
[03:28:00]  We thought it was going to be funny, but he did.  Finally, Roland tells some jokes on the street in Aspen.  It's a comedy festival, so Roland is outside on the corner with a joke book in hand.  Oh.  Telling jokes.  Again, not my idea.  Oh.  With his funny head on still.  Oh, God.  We have to have you do some of this stuff for the show.  Who knew?  See?  Look at him.  Look at him.  Oh.  The worst. 
[03:28:30]  Look, his whole face collapses.  Like he just ate a lemon.  I'm having so much fun in Aspen.  I want to come back next year.  Maybe if I perfect my joke telling, they'll invite me back as a performer.  What did one hot dog say to the other?  Hey, Frank.  Hey.  Frank.  Frank.  Did you hear about Flasher who was thinking of retiring?  He decided to stick it out one more year.  Stick it out.  Hey. 
[03:29:00]  How many women with PMS does it take to change a light bulb?  Six.  Why?  Because it just does.  I did a pad.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You're radio gold.  Oh, do you stink?  You just stink.  He's like a sideshow attraction.  Come see him devoid of charisma.  It aired during like a prime time thing.  Oh, dude.  It's entertaining as hell, man.  My parents were like, oh, God. 
[03:29:30]  Why?  I got to see the video.  Yeah, absolutely.  Got to see it.  I hear you were a lot thinner, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  I had to take off my shirt for later on.  Julie Bowen came out.  And I had to take off my shirt to give it to her.  He has body hair like Steve.  Yeah.  That was a Chewbacca impression.  Can we see your body hair?  No.  Just your back hair.  Look.  No.  It's like a chick on the couch.  Come on, man.  Let me just.  Come on, man.  No. 
[03:30:00]  Just a little.  Turn around and just show us a little.  It's a lot of hair.  A lot.  On your back?  You got back hair?  That's why I don't need to wear a jacket.  You meant to give me a war.  All right.  Let's just see it.  That's all right.  We've seen Jimmy's cock.  You can show us a little back hair.  Who gives a shit?  Come on.  Just a little.  A little.  You just pull up the back of the shirt.  We won't laugh at you.  We won't.  I'm sure you will.  All right.  All right.  That's not.  Whatever, man.  That's not that bad.  Steve's laughing.  Do you have a hairy ass?

Okay.  Good job.  Oh, thanks.  Look at him.  Carson had some vision there with you.  He sure did.  Some fucking vision with you, man.  What?  I did four other episodes.  Four other episodes?
