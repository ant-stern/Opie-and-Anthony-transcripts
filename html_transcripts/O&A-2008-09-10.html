<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a chaotic start, marked by significant technical difficulties in the studio, prompting Opie to threaten to destroy the equipment.  The hosts then transitioned to a discussion of home invasions in Suffolk County, followed by a debate about new Long Island pool regulations, specifically mandated solar heating and filter run times. This led to a bizarre recounting of a prank involving Keith's naked swim through Opie's pool. The conversation shifted to a heated, profane New York versus Boston sports rivalry fueled by Tom Brady's injury, with numerous listener calls adding to the fervor.  The hosts extensively and crudely analyzed Barack Obama's "lipstick on a pig" comment regarding Sarah Palin.  Bill Burr appeared as a guest in studio later in this initial segment.

The show then delved into political commentary surrounding the 2008 presidential election.  Opie and Anthony ridiculed a John McCain campaign ad falsely claiming Obama supported kindergarten sex education, mocked Obama's background, and made fun of a supposed "terrorist fist bump."  They played and heavily criticized several other political ads, including those for John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, highlighting their poor execution. A significant portion was dedicated to analyzing – with repeated playbacks – the absurd and offensive attack ads for Paul R. Nelson, a Wisconsin political candidate who later died from a gunshot wound.  The hosts admitted to previously supporting Nelson’s campaign.  A user-submitted, heavily censored, and offensive Sarah Palin parody ad was also played.  The segment briefly touched upon the Large Hadron Collider's activation and the possibility of a black hole before concluding with listener calls detailing embarrassing adolescent romantic encounters.  Bill Burr remained a studio guest during this portion, promoting his upcoming DVD release.

The next segment opened with Opie sharing an anecdote about a girlfriend at Quinnipiac College and her dislike of surprise visits.  Bill Burr was thanked again for his appearance, and his DVD and CD releases were promoted.  Colin Quinn called in, and the conversation shifted between cringeworthy personal anecdotes (including one involving Jim Norton and a Mark Anthony song, and Opie's failed *Say Anything*-inspired romantic gesture), Obama’s political comments, Russell Brand’s humor, and Al Pacino's acting style, comparing it to De Niro's and Jim Norton's comedic stylings to Colin Quinn’s.  A discussion about a violent scene in a movie with a large frog was also included. After Quinn left, the show launched into a “bra bingo” game, involving sexually explicit jokes, comments about body parts, and discussions of callers' "boob tricks." Callers recounted anecdotes involving squirting breast milk, and a woman's topless jumping jacks in front of her children were discussed. The possibility of having a lactating woman on the show was also raised. This segment concluded with continued bra bingo and sexually explicit conversations.

The “Bra Bingo” game continued into the following segment, heavily focusing on breast size and sexually suggestive comments.  Callers described various "breast tricks," and a 34M bra size caller’s experience dominated a portion of the segment.  A dispute arose over whether Jimmy Norton cheated at the game.  The hosts then attempted to get callers to sing, often resulting in poor performances.  Sam's experiences interviewing people at a "Prayer in the Square" event in Times Square were shared, highlighting the varied reactions he received when asking "What's the haps?".  The conversation drifted into discussions about religion, heaven, hell, and graphic violence. The segment concluded with a chaotic rendition of Justin Timberlake's "SexyBack".

The final segment started with a humorous discussion about a possible radio preview focusing on vaginas.  The "line of the day" segment degenerated into crude and offensive commentary about vaginas, using graphic language and misogynistic remarks.  The conversation veered into unrelated topics, including brief mentions of Obama and McCain, and invented places like "Retardsville," "Tit Town," and "AIDS Town."  The show ended with Jim Norton promoting his sold-out show at the Wilbur Theater and announcing an additional performance.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the language used was consistently crude, offensive, and sexually explicit.

[00:03:30]  victim of uh home invasion what are the what's there to steal in Mastic in a home invasion I know  that that asshole I would think the hell are they getting in in Mastic I would think it would be a  standoff between the home invaders and the homeowner just both going give me your stuff right I uh  thank god you're here I need something I know you got something they're just a big standoff  or or the the loser in the Mastic house is is sitting there and the home invader comes in 
[00:04:00]  it's like thank god you're here take it take whatever you want it's all crap first home invasion  where the home invader gets you know robbed yeah do you get it you got better stuff than I do  but uh oh epidemic there in the past week I think they've had uh four or five home invasions in  Suffolk County that's one county over and uh well I don't know god that is just I am so paranoid of 
[00:04:30]  the home invasion I don't know if the media's whipped it up got me in a frenzy about it culture  of fear my friend uh oh do I do I just think about a home invasion all the time because the media did  that to you it's the culture of fear I'm telling you the percentage of people getting home invaded  is uh is uh minuscule can I tell you what um what Keith did over the weekend sure if I conveyed that 
[00:05:00]  besides getting you out of a ticket no no no Keith didn't do that no no not that time he's very good  with that you're starting to get paranoid we're doing stuff for the radio show yeah right I don't  know what you what he does for you and and what happens in your world we were all jokes we were  all hanging out yeah you know a few beers barbecuing yeah and stuff and uh then I have these  pool alarms on the gates you have to have there's a new law you got to have alarms on your gates that 
[00:05:30]  go whenever they open up to the backyard and that's actually any door to your backyard sliding  left door in your house the basement door any doorway into your backyard needs a friggin meh meh meh alarm  this is America right yeah so they're telling you what to do in your own backyard right ah yeah that's  that's that's interesting they just don't want their Sunday afternoon pierced by a screaming parent  noticing something there's a little a little dark spot kind of wavy at the bottom of the pool you're 
[00:06:00]  like is that junior why should someone like Anthony have to worry about someone else's kids that's  that's complete crap watch your own kids keep them out of my yard I mean they they force you to put a  fence around your whole property you have a pool right or actually fence yeah so shouldn't that be  good enough now you used to be now you need alarms not only that now you're not you need an alarm  in your pool there's an alarm that goes it hangs over the edge and these things aren't cheap and 
[00:06:30]  they make you have to buy them I'm convinced that the manufacturers and the places that sell these  then kick back some of the money to the county uh uh yeah they have to because going with your home  invasion thing yep the amount of uh kids drowning in pools compared to the people that have pools and  you can't you can't even you can't you there's not it's a minuscule percentage and someone always  have to suffer now and spend more money it is crazy on their pool it's it's crazy and the county and 
[00:07:00]  then the county's got to send over an inspector to inspect to make sure you have all this stuff and  it's working properly but there's a sensor that goes in your pool that if somebody falls in it makes  a wave and there's a little float inside the thing and meh meh meh so you know you get a good windy  day or something and it kind of stirs up the water you're constantly going over there and pushing the  button to shut it off and can't you just uh disalarm it no that's against the the rules and the law 
[00:07:30]  but who would know but who would know but they'll change against the law but they'll change that too and  make sure they have some kind of big brother thing to make sure the alarm is on at all times it'll be  wired into the friggin matrix stunt brain uh how many pools are on long island and how many how  many uh 40 40 pools and how many unfortunate kids uh drowned in the last uh year i'll look into that 
[00:08:00]  but there's also another nanny state regulation that goes into effect october 1st on long island  in the suffolk county area in southampton you now have to heat your pool using a solar heater  and it has to be 80 degrees and can be no more than 86 and you now have to run the filter at night  or at the lowest time of electrical use and they can come over and check you for it they're legislating  your pool temperature what happened to america we have no real freedoms anymore well we got a freedom 
[00:08:30]  tower that's about to be built where's my freedoms you won't have any freedom it's just gone  legislating your pool temperature and you have to solar heat it if you're going to replace your  heater this is in your county or town or whatever town of southampton yeah but it starts in one town  yeah yeah and then it takes everything else so so if you have a regular pool heater now that's on  propane or gas or whatever uh electric uh you're fine but if you go to replace it then you're gonna 
[00:09:00]  have to replace it with a solar heater what and they're gonna tell you isn't that just called  leaving your pool out in the sun yeah that's a solar heater but the fact that they can come over and  check the temperature if you have enough money to keep your pool 110 degrees whose business is it  i completely agree and there's no way they can actually check your temperature oh they have uh the  ability to come over with a county official and check your pool temperature and the other thing 
[00:09:30]  that's big brother crap what time you run your filter they're going to tell you when the electrical  loads are at the lowest point and when you can run your filter and it says something about keeping  the pool clean within the minimum health standards so now they're going to tell you how clean your pool  can be and uh if oh if your pool filter engine is more than two horsepower you have to have a  variable speed governor on it it's insanity come on well jimmy knows my uh pool is well in compliance 
[00:10:00]  god almighty you 36 degrees below regulation 36 degrees  they love icy pool they love cool me they're like oh cool yeah cool me look at  so his uh jacuzzi was really cold it was uh it was a bit it's toasty yeah i know  i know i got it all down now but uh i i gotta get back to the original thing is what keith did  of course and i got these alarms on the gates so uh we're hanging out over the weekend i said i was 
[00:10:30]  gonna have you know a few people over some barbecue and beers so hanging out uh i don't even know what  time it was maybe 10 o'clock at night something like that and um the gate opens up on the side of  the house and i see just this figure come running into my yard and uh he's completely naked that's  keith yeah sorry i started blow oh no no because i said it was keith this guy but it's keith he was 
[00:11:00]  completely naked he jumps in the pool yeah swims out to the other side gets out runs through the  other gate on the other side setting off that alarm and i go around shutting the alarms off and now we're  just sitting there waiting for him to come back so we could all have a laugh he never comes back  he just he left he did that and then took off and left and and travis started texting him and saying  uh so what are you running around uh the town naked and he goes what are you talking about i'm home with

[00:21:30]  Nothing?  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  A lot of controversy this morning.  I kind of like this Kurt Schilling.  I got to be honest with you.  What?  I know.  It's like sacrilege because we're in the heart of New York City.  Well, he's an old friend, by the way.  I guess, what do they say?  Like full disclosure?  Yeah.  I used to drink beers and hang out with the guy when he was allegedly banging everything in sight in Rochester, New York. 
[00:22:00]  Before he became a fine Christian fella.  Oh, really?  He doesn't want to talk about the old days when he was pitching for the Rochester Red Wings.  And earning his.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow, I feel that bummed.  Nah.  Took a little.  Took a minute or so to sink in.  I like what the room examines it carefully.  Yes.  Took a minute or so to determination.  Yeah.  Full disclosure.  So, back in the day, we were all friends.  Trying to make it. 
[00:22:30]  Aw.  I think he did a little better than I.  He's doing all right.  He did okay, right?  He's doing fine, too.  My best Kurt Schilling story.  I haven't told him in a while, but.  His bloody sock.  Well.  His bloody underwear.  I forgot who he was pitching for, I think.  Because he was, like, pitching for a lot of different teams for a while there.  What was it?  Was it the Astros?  Help me.  Help me.  No, I haven't been following his Schilling story.  No, I know he was with the Phillies, but.  I was down in Orlando, and I went to a strip club with an old PD that used to be the PD 
[00:23:00]  in Buffalo.  Moved down to Florida.  I went down there to visit my sister.  I was in a strip club with this PD, just kind of catching up.  And Mr. Schilling walked in with a few ball players, because it was spring training time,  and completely took care of me when he saw I was there.  Completely took care of me.  Lap dances, drinks for everybody.  He gave you lap dance?  Wow.  Yeah, he's got a mule.  He had a few seasons with Baltimore, then one season with Houston before going on to 
[00:23:30]  Philly.  I think it was when he was with Houston, doing a little spring training down there.  All right, stunt Google.  So, full disclosure, I kind of like this Kurt Schilling.  Yeah.  He's bad-mouthing New York today.  Before you do that, can I just say what a smart guy's stunt brain is?  To make it look like he doesn't Google, he knows exactly what he's saying is right,  because he knows one season, 81.  He goes, I think he had one season.  Yeah, yeah, it was like, I believe it's a...  We're on to your trickery.  It looks like...  Chicanery.  It's something like two seasons. 
[00:24:00]  He just read 81 to 83.  It's something like two seasons.  You know what he just read?  It was two seasons.  Yes.  He's a polished broadcaster.  But Schilling, you know...  I just think he's a good liar.  Schilling changed his ways, and I believe he's found Jesus or something, whatever.  It usually happens after something happens.  Yeah.  So I probably believe exactly what you're saying.  So...  Well, I could...  It looked like to me that he might have been dating the featured dancer. 
[00:24:30]  Ooh.  Oh.  That's a coup.  This goes way back.  I'm talking like...  Well, I don't want people to know...  Perhaps a week or two.  I don't want people to know how old I really am.  So I think it was about five or six years ago.  Oh, okay.  When you were still in college.  Yeah, exactly.  We were off then, remember?  Oh, yeah.  No, this goes way back.  Jeff M. from Staten Island writes,  Tell that whiny little C Schilling to shut the F up,  or us New Yorkers will remind him of how he cried like a little girl on national TV 
[00:25:00]  when the Yankees spanked his ass on Sunday Night Baseball.  What a poo-ha!  This is what Schilling said yesterday.  Since, you know, I don't know if it's six or seven years going on now,  people don't like us anymore.  And so everybody...  I mean, the euphoria in New York is palpable, you know?  I mean, the Yankees suck this year, and they're bitter and mad,  and they're making excuses over that,  and now they got Tom going down, so New York's excited. 
[00:25:30]  And it's unfortunate, but that's what happens when you end up crawling to the top of the pile.  There's a lot of people trying to drag you down.  I got news for you, Kurt.  They never liked you.  Can I...  You know, in all fairness, you know, of course New Yorkers are going to be excited that Tom Brady went down.  Of course.  That's what sports is all about.  Right.  It's the drama.  If one of the star athletes here in New York went down,  we spend a lot of time in Boston.  They're going to do the exact same thing.  Oh, yeah.  Why are they making it look like we're the idiots, and, you know, Boston would be, you know... 
[00:26:00]  Would handle it differently.  Yeah.  That's crap.  It's human nature.  Both cities are jerks.  Right.  It's true.  If Tom Brady were black, half of Boston would be glad he went down.  Yeah.  I got news for you, Kurt.  They never liked you.  Oh, no.  That's okay, though.  That's okay, because I was front row and center when their, quote-unquote, dynasty ended.  So, I'm okay with that.  Did you ever get cheered? 
[00:26:30]  Did you ever get hurt and hear cheers from, like, the cheers of derision from opposing fans?  No, no.  It is...  You point to that.  You used the right word.  It is palpable.  The schadenfreude, the joy they're taking in other markets, particularly in New York,  over this devastating injury.  Well, they want us to be as bitter and mad and miserable as they are.  What?  How long...  Oh, shut up.  How long was Boston bitter, mad, and for decades? 
[00:27:00]  And they still are.  You still hear Yankees suck chants.  Now, it's true, but, you know...  Well, finally, it's true.  Finally, they can say it with some truth behind it.  That's right.  Anthony, Yankees, well, they got a win last night.  Yes, they did.  But they are eight and a half...  Beat the Angels.  Eight and a half games behind in the wild card.  All right, come on.  With 17 games.  But they're rallying.  They beat the Angels.  Are they?  The Angels kicked their ass the night before. 
[00:27:30]  I know.  12-1, I do believe.  The Mets won, right?  Yeah, the Mets are hanging in there.  Yeah.  Two and a half games ahead of the Phillies.  So, and this is the rest of it.  They want us to be as bitter and mad and miserable as they are.  And unfortunately, it's not going to happen, because I think that, you know, the sad part  is going to be when they beat the Jets next week.  Right.  And then, you know, they're going to come up with something.  Oh, I certainly hope the Jets just spank the Pats.  Just to just...  I hope it's a close victory. 
[00:28:00]  No, no.  I hope it's a close victory that probably wouldn't have happened had Brady been there.  Right.  Just to make it hurt that much.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, Brady would have made that.  Yeah, some easy-for-the-win last-second play that Brady would have just made, and he just...  Who's QB in for him now?  I don't know.  Some guy?  Castle.  Yeah, Castle.  Yeah, Castle.  Rocko!  And then he just fades back and gets sacked.  I hope it's one of those plays...  Pummeled. 
[00:28:30]  They're on the 15-yard line.  And then, there's a guy in the end zone, like it's old school, like you're in the playground  jumping up and down, like, I'm right here!  I'm open!  I'm open!  There's no one around!  And just throws it 20 yards over his head.  Over his head into the stands.  Just out of pure panic.  Just loses his mind.  All right, we're going to go to a neutral city, because this could get ugly today.  Oh.  We got Nick in Pennsylvania.  Nick?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Me and my wife are truck drivers, and we were in Massachusetts the other day, and we saw 
[00:29:00]  a billboard in Massachusetts that said, root for Boston, or whoever is playing New York.  So I think they go a little further out of the way than we do.  Oh, of course they do.  So that's all I have to say.  I think they take it more seriously, and they're more aggressive about it.  I just think we hate them because we have to play them, but I think they go out of their  way, and it's deeper in their culture.  Well, if Brett Favre went down with the type of injury Brady had, they would be jumping 
[00:29:30]  for joy in Boston.  That's just how it is.  And not even that it would be like, you know, Tom Brady, where he led the team, led the  Pats all the way up to the Super Bowl, undefeated.  One game.  Favre playing one game with the Jets, if he went down with an injury like that, they'd  be like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Even though he's not even really known as, you know, a New York guy yet. 
[00:30:00]  He hasn't really gotten in there yet, Brett Favre.  But they're happy he went down because they don't have to play him now.  Yeah.  How does stupid Schilling, who if you were so happy with losing, you dummy, you would have  stayed in Philadelphia, but you got out of there, because you don't have to deal with  him.  Nobody wants to deal with Brady.  Schilling sounds like kind of a real pompous douche.  He is a douche.  Yeah, he was a lot different back in the day, I'll tell you that much. 
[00:30:30]  Boy, does he kill the Yankees, too.  I hope his foot is run over by a forklift.  Oh, he'd still pitch.  Murder the Yankees.  All right.  Yeah.  So we got that going on today.  And then, well, we got the Obama thing.  Oh, this, wow.  This was on the front pages of all the papers.  This is the lead story.  Everyone's looking for the slip up.  Every news organization's looking for one side or the other to make that slip up. 
[00:31:00]  And this, I think, was one.  This is something that Obama should have just left alone.  Where was he speaking, by the way?  Revlon.  Why are you asking the hard questions?  At a rally.  Some rally.  Yeah, he was rallying the troops somewhere.  Yeah.  The front page, by the way, lipstick bungle.  McCain hits Obama for pig in lipstick crack.  Barack says he was poking fun at the GOP in general. 
[00:31:30]  No.  No.  You're lying.  And the other thing that calls themselves a paper, Obama, you could put lipstick on a pig.  It's still a pig.  And then it says, boar, war.  Oh.  Great.  Yeah, the comment was absolutely a response to the comment that she made about a pit bull.  Yeah.  I got to stop you.  The difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is just lipstick. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  I got to stop you for one second.  Because obviously we're on a delay.  Now everyone's outraged about the Boston-New York thing.  Hold on.  Norm in Boston.  Listening on BCN.  Norm.  Norm.  I get it.  What's going on, guys?  To the truck driver, first, I'm surprised you can read.  Second, it's a Molson ad campaign for a Canadian company.  It doesn't say.  It says, who do you root for, Boston teams or anyone who plays New York?  Second, who cares about the Jets? 
[00:32:30]  Come Monday morning, it's going to be like every other season.  J-E-T-S.  Just end the season, baby.  Wait, that's not what that stands for.  No, no.  You can't just end the season.  It started.  It just started.  Just end the season.  That's not true.  That's horrid.  That's not what it stands for.  No, of course not.  We'll get back to the Obama thing in a second, but this is going to be too good.  Marky Mark in Boston.  What's up, buddy?  Marky Mark.  Hey, I'm a hardcore Boston fan, and I agree with all of what you're saying right now. 
[00:33:00]  If the Yankees, if any of those beeps got hurt, I would hate every single one of them, and  I would love it.  There you go.  There's an honest Boston fan.  I love it.  I want to see them all get hurt.  I'm going to laugh in their faces for being cocky little assholes for the longest time,  because Boston, we're on top with number one, baby.  Number one.  That's why Schilling, by the way, that audio is from EEI, and it's completely ridiculous,  because if it was the other way around, Boston would be cheering. 
[00:33:30]  Of course.  I'm sure they're having a field day with the fact that the Yankees suck this year.  Who are they kidding, EEI and Schilling?  They're not being honest with this crap.  Let's go to Brian in Boston.  Brian.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to say that most Boston fans, most of us really don't like Curt Schilling.  I'll be honest with you, when he went down with an injury, I was actually pretty happy.  This guy, he actually called in a drunk driver one time to the police. 
[00:34:00]  He plays EverQuest and whatever Dungeons & Dragons stupid games on his, you know, he's  always, he has a blog.  This guy can't shut up.  He hasn't pitched a pitch this year, and he can't shut his fat mouth.  Oh, he's bored.  Well, dude, call in a drunk driver.  Hold on.  I'll agree about the other stuff, but if he called in a drunk driver,  driver, that's not a bad thing to do.  He probably just did it because he saw, like, a Yankee plate, one of those Yankee license  plates.  Yeah, but it goes with the whole, you know, do-gooder attitude. 
[00:34:30]  That's a very different thing.  Got us a crusader.  It's funny, though.  He stopped the rape.  Guy sucks.  Put on a fire.  Most people would applaud that.  He called 911.  He stopped the beating.  More examples, Jim.  Same joke.  It's good, though.  Anthony, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  I know.  That's what the Anthony part is.  Anthony, go. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I drive Ronald off to work, and, you know, I seen a bumper sticker not too long ago, and  it said, I'd rather have my daughter working for a whorehouse than have my son play for  the Yankees.  You know, I bet if push came to shove, he'd change his opinion.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of the way I felt about the situation.  Because could you see the daughter coming home with her whorehouse paycheck and the son  coming home with his Yankee paycheck? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think dear old dad would probably like having the son on the Yankees.  Yeah.  Do you want to put that Yankee check in or the one from WH Incorporated?  Wait a minute.  W-H.  Whorehouse.  Whorehouse.  Okay.  I was thinking of a name.  Well, I couldn't say whorehouse on the check.  Of course not.  The Yankees would take it.  Let's go to Wes Milford.  What do I always say?  I work for the whorehouse, dad.  The whorehouse.  That's my whorehouse check.  Wouldn't happen.  Wes Milford. 
[00:36:00]  Rich, what's up?  Remember?  Rich?  Hello?  Go ahead, Rich.  Turn down your effing radio, please.  It's on.  All right.  What do you got?  I just want to say that the Patriots are sore losers because now when every time they're  going to lose a game, they're just going to complain.  And say, oh, man, we would have won the game if Tom Brady was there.  So now they're going to always use that as an excuse because they're going to suck this  year.  All right.  That was worth it.  Dan in Massachusetts.  What's going on? 
[00:36:30]  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yo, that last guy.  He was pretty insightful.  I listened to the show yesterday.  I actually was at work.  The whole shilling thing from start to finish.  I mean, he goes on there kind of as a blowhard, whatever.  But I kind of appreciate the fact that he goes on there and speaks his mind compared to  the crap that A-Rod puts out.  I mean, so what?  He goes on there.  He says what us as Boston fans want to hear.  I mean, wouldn't you Yankee fans love to hear if A-Rod came out and started to trash 
[00:37:00]  on Boston fans?  No, we love if A-Rod got one hit that counted.  When it made a difference.  We love it for once.  There was a guy on second and A-Rod actually got the ball to the infield.  He sucks.  I don't care what he says about Boston.  Jim, are you trying to say you're frustrated when the Yankees are up like 17-2 and then A-Rod  finally hits a home run?  A-Rod in!  I wouldn't know.  I didn't watch games this year.  Yeah, I know.  Who cares?  I do believe last night his home run did count for something.  That's wonderful.  What was it?  What was the score? 
[00:37:30]  They won 7-1.  Good for them.  It's over.  When did he hit the home run?  Was it 7-1?  No.  How does the A-Rod homer count?  No, it wasn't 7-1.  Why did he score?  He's won 7-1.  We should have the scores here.  I thought it was like 8-6 or something.  No, they won 7-1.  Why would we have sports scores as we're ending the baseball season?  Why would we?  Watch it out.  Is that sports scores?  No.  Who's that crybaby up on the...  Which one?  That first one?  Oh, no.  We got to get the Billy Wagner audio.  Oh, Billy Wagner.  It's going to kill me, but we have to play it today in all games. 
[00:38:00]  This is a weeping.  About to basketball off his head like Robert Duvall.  You going to squirt?  The weeping athlete is one of my favorite bits ever.  I'm serious.  Oh, this is good.  I'm going to have to retire with my $20 million.  Could be career ending.  A-Rod's homer was the margin of victory last night.  It was 1-0 when he hit it.  Then it was 4-0, and then the Angels started scoring. 
[00:38:30]  But he did hit the winning run with his homer.  Big deal.  Yeah, you know what?  Yeah.  Good point, and I applaud Robe Soup and Tears from Wack Bag.  Robe Soup and Tears?  The Robe Soup and Tears from Wack Bag.  He writes, thank you for this one.  I'm going to call you RST.  Thank you, RST.  Hey, Opie, most people don't know.  Kurt named his son.  I forgot about this.  After a Yankee.  He's got a son named Gehrig.  Really?  Born before he went to Boston, yes. 
[00:39:00]  Could be worse.  Yeah.  It's my son, windshield forehead.  Striker.  My son, lousy pilot.  Striker.  Hey, it's my boy.  Good morning, Striker.  Striker, every day.  Striker.  Striker.  Now, this is Boston.  How can you tell when there isn't a drunk driver on the road?  Yeah.  Very funny.  His phone bill is huge from calling 911.  Here's another one. 
[00:39:30]  Look, we spent a lot of time in Boston.  Drive around Southie.  That's all you're going to see.  We spent a lot of time in Boston, a lot of time in New York.  I think it's safe to say there's a lot more people driving drunk in Boston.  Hell yeah.  My observation.  Oh, hell yeah.  I'm sure Mayor Menino's not going to appreciate my observation today, but that's what I have  seen over the years.  Yep.  Just the car rides from downtown Boston back to Ashland.  Yeah.  Woo!  They are just a bunch of drunks in Boston.  I'll be happy to tell them that when I do my second show, because the first one is 
[00:40:00]  sold out.  Wow.  Jimmy Norton.  Would that be the Wilbur Theater, Jimmy?  Oh, I hope you don't be fresh.  Yes, it is.  The 15th, the early show's added, but tomorrow the pre-sale, whatever.  Congrats.  I like that.  I was so happy with myself there.  And the bit begins.  Mongo the Trucker.  What's wrong with the sports teams we got?  They play pretty good.  The Knickerbockers.  What's some of those other sports teams? 
[00:40:30]  Merchant Pons.  The Nets.  Rangers.  Rangers.  Islander.  They play pretty good.  Merchant.  Buffalo Bill.  Merchant.  Merchant.  You got the full clip so we can bring everyone a board.  Merchant.  We're going to go to a break here, but it's our new bit.  We just do it when we're not on the air.  I don't even know if it's funny or if it makes sense, but it's the story of the Alabama lawmaker 
[00:41:00]  who wants to keep the high alcohol content beers out of his district.  Yes.  So he had a little press conference with his little sidekick there.  And he was just discussing how the beer that they have already is good enough.  Is good enough.  I don't have to go with like high alcohol content beer.  His sidekick is terrific.  And his sidekick suggestions are helpful and terrific. 
[00:41:30]  Of course.  And unintelligible.  Because of this stupid 30-second clip, this is all we do behind the scenes now.  Whenever we're discussing anything.  Yeah, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the beer we have.  It drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser, what is it?  Mill.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  It drank pretty good, don't it? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, I love that guy.  He sounds deaf.  He really does.  Miller.  Cool.  He sounds like a band cartoon voice.  We know what the politician looks like.  We need a picture of the sidekick there.  What he looks like.  We're desperately looking for a picture of that guy.  Fantastic.  All right, quick break.  And then we'll get into the Sarah Palin thing. 
[00:42:30]  The Obama thing.  God, he's still there.  More of the Boston versus New York thing.  What seminar breaks we do?  What?  Obama.  No.  Major world.  Hot phone.  Hot phone.  Is that an S-bone?  Fire department.  What's wrong with the commercials we got?  They play pretty good. 
[00:43:00]  What's wrong with the crowd we got?  They're leaving pretty fast.  All right.  877-212-ONA.  More of your phone calls.  They're going pretty well today, so we'll continue.  Caveman commercial.  I'm sorry.  Yuck.  Mill.  He told me he's boobies and I liked him.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Jimmy, comment?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I'm very happy.  So, and by the way, they're real in this big second. 
[00:43:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  God damn it.  Fuck this show.  Take this fucking show and forget it.  Forget fucking.  Fuck it back.  This is a recording.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Please leave a message after the tone.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line at 866-FU-LINE-1.  866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you. 
[00:44:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You fuck.  The show's getting better and better as we go along here.  Opie and Anthony and Bill Burr has entered the studio.  Yes.  Hello, gentlemen.  Wearing his Red Sox hat, which is a brave move here in New York City.  Do you get crap for wearing that?  No.  A lot of people are wearing them now.  You notice like...  It's trendy, right?  Yeah, since they've been, you know, winning and stuff, a lot of the people, the Johnny 
[00:44:30]  Come Latelys, I like to call them.  Oh.  Well, I've been wearing it for years.  Yeah, no, I know.  Taking the pounding.  I earned it.  Yeah.  You earned it.  The right.  Kind of like how a lot of people aren't wearing Yankee stuff anymore.  Nah.  Like the reverse bandwagon.  Yeah, you kind of don't see a lot of the Yankee stuff.  Reminds me of 1995 when I first moved down here.  You couldn't find a Yankee hat, and then they won it in 96, and everybody's walking around  with their brand new Yankee gear.  Dude, I always loved them.  Oh, yeah.  Talk about them in the 80s when you were in Shea Stadium with your Gary Carter t-shirt. 
[00:45:00]  Talk about Roy Smalley.  Who are Bo Diaz?  Who do they have on that team?  Oh, my God.  They're going back with some crappy players.  Yeah, but Pete, you've earned the right to wear that and gloat and do everything else.  You went through the lean centuries.  Well, thank you, Anthony.  You know, so.  There's a lot of implants.  Vaguely condescending, but you've earned your right there, young man.  Sit up straight.  Well, it's funny.  There's an exchange because Anthony goes, Bill, you're wearing the Red Sox hat, and then 
[00:45:30]  Bill goes, what are you wearing, Anthony, and what did you tell Mr. Burr?  I said, I don't know.  It's some hat from a video game that's about the closest thing to a frigging swastika.  I don't even know what it is.  It's a propeller set on wings, but the propeller's kind of twisted.  It kind of has the, yeah.  It's like this little swirly, but it's only got three, like, three little arms coming off  of it, not four, and they're not twisted.  It's like the metal one of the Nazi guys would wear.  Yeah, the hat looks very close.  Like the Luftwaffe. 
[00:46:00]  The hat looks very close to being illegal.  It'll probably get me in trouble in Germany.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, where they don't allow any of that anymore.  The boy, did they not like acknowledging any of that.  Ixnay on the Otsy-nay.  Let's make believe it never happened.  Yeah.  Let's just move on.  It's like Pats fans talking about the last Super Bowl.  Yeah, yeah, we'll skip over that.  Let's just skip right over that.  Let's talk about the first 18 games.  He made the trains run on time.  I like that.  What do you got on Brady going down there, Mr. Burr?  Oh, yeah, obviously. 
[00:46:30]  A lot of sadness up there in Boston.  Yeah, but I think we're still going to be definitely competitive.  I think Lawrence Maroney is going to have a breakout year,  and Belichick is going to go back to what he used to do,  which is a time of possession game.  Some drunk idiot last night was trying to say,  now we're going to see what Belichick is really worth.  See if he's really a good coach.  Really?  Three rings?  He goes, he's never won without a superstar quarterback.  It's like, don't you remember when they were winning it,  and everyone was like, this is a boring team.  They don't have any stars.  Now all of a sudden he's – it's like people don't even remember last week. 
[00:47:00]  No.  You know what I mean?  Don't you remember when he was a defensive coordinator on the Giants  and he shut down the running gun?  Who did he have quarterback then?  I can't remember.  Who was the quarterback in 1990?  Was it Hofstetter?  Food, wow.  Jeff Hofstetter?  He had a really nice mustache.  He really did.  He knew how to wear the mustache.  It was a Tom Selleck thing, but it didn't have the gay vibe.  You know what I would like to see Bill Belichick do?  Do a little prison break.  Hang himself?  And get Michael Vick out of jail to throw for the pads.  Well, that could be all right. 
[00:47:30]  That's a good idea.  I didn't even think of that.  Hey, wait a minute.  Is he still in jail for that?  Yeah, I think Bill Belichick –  Such an overreaction.  What a horrible thing to have to just be in the prison chow line  and just go in there going, for dogs.  For dogs I'm in here.  Here's a murderer.  Here's some rape guy.  Here's like armed robbery guy.  And I'm in here for, you know, woo, woo.  Yeah, it was definitely bad what the guy did.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a huge fine. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Huge fine, right.  Terry Press Conference.  Exactly.  And then you're out.  And jail.  I'm glad he's in jail.  Are you?  Not a Falcons fan, Jimmy?  No.  Exactly what it is, too.  Probably.  All right, listen.  We've got to get to the Obama thing, but we want to tell everybody Bill Burr's DVD came out yesterday.  Yeah, look at this.  Have you all got our copies of Why Do I Do This?  It actually comes out, I think, the 16th.  September 16th.  Okay, next Tuesday.  Yeah.  And a lot of people on the lines already, Bill, I just want to acknowledge, they're all saying how great the special was. 
[00:48:30]  They all saw it.  Oh, awesome, man.  A lot of fans saw the special.  Ah, relief.  So pick up the DVD.  Obama, I'm loving the fact that he kind of said this thing there.  You want to just play the clip first and get into it?  Play the clip.  Play the clip.  Here we go.  That's not change.  Ah, racist.  That's just calling the same thing something different.  But, you know, you can put lipstick on a pig. 
[00:49:00]  It's still a pig.  Holy Apollo Theater.  Nice.  Wow.  Nice.  He is talking about the GOP, though.  He's so talking about the GOP.  What?  Because they're talking about how they're going to do their own change thing, and he's like, eh.  Oh, yeah, they're stealing his catchphrase.  Yeah.  It's so not.  This is an exact.  This is.  Here we go.  He said that just because of the line. 
[00:49:30]  What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull?  Yeah.  And she said lipstick.  Yeah.  So he ran with the lipstick line saying, you know, you put lipstick on a pig.  It's still a pig.  And then he said you can wrap an old fish or you could.  What did he say about the old fish statement?  Fish in a newspaper.  Fish in a newspaper.  It's still going to stink or something.  Like the old fish.  I think that line.  They're not even paying attention to that one.  But that's McCain is the old fish.  And the lipstick line on a pig is Pelosi. 
[00:50:00]  Or what's her name?  Palin.  Palin.  I keep getting those two names mixed up.  Sarah Palin.  I constantly will in there.  Yeah, but no one.  Opposite ends of the spectrum.  But no one's looking at Sarah Palin and saying that.  They both got slits.  Exactly.  Hole one and hole two.  Won't make it through, but I had to say it.  No one's looking at Sarah Palin and thinking that she's a pig, though.  No, it doesn't matter.  That's the one thing we're all in agreement, that she's a hot, older woman.  It doesn't matter.  You could say that about any hot chick.  It's better if you say it about a hot chick, that she's a pig. 
[00:50:30]  He just called her a pig.  That rocks.  He got up there and called her a pig.  That rocks.  And let me tell you something, and this is just based on my experience, my vast experience  with Americans.  Middle America is not going to like a black man making pig jokes about a white woman.  We still live in that society.  I'll tell you, I know Middle America.  I don't think I put my white guy voice on that the black comedians use to sound like 
[00:51:00]  a white guy.  Let me tell you, I'm not going to fall for that banana in the tailpipe routine.  You've never been to Middle America.  You've never hung out with Middle America.  What do you know what they're saying?  I drove back and forth across this great land of ours many times.  Without stopping.  Yes.  Without stopping.  He sounds like Al Gore when he was talking about the tobacco.  Yes.  I farmed it.  I held it in my hands.  You know, I was in a small town in Oklahoma when a woman came up to me one day and said,  Anthony, I can't afford the basic needs for my children. 
[00:51:30]  Those people never exist.  No, they never say it like that.  The town never exists.  They never talk to people like that.  I can't watch either the, I couldn't watch the Republican or the Democratic National Convention.  It's so insulting.  It was great TV though, man.  But watching everybody flip out and nobody saying anything.  Yeah.  Do you just, those applause break lines?  For nothing.  I think it's time to stop being off the rails and start getting on the rails.  Yeah!  And everybody just goes bananas.  It's like, you know.  Balloons are falling, confetti's going, and they're saying nothing. 
[00:52:00]  We're going to go to Washington.  We're going to get people back to work.  Yeah!  That's all they do for an hour and a half.  It's horrible.  Bill, I told Anthony that those conventions gave us a glimpse of what communism would be.  Because you didn't get the other side for a week.  You know what I mean?  It was all rah, rah, rah.  Yeah, just one-sided.  We're great, we're great.  Yeah, big parade.  No one else matters.  Right.  And I love...  Everybody's taking a dump on the side of the road because there's no public toilets.  Right.  I love how Obama's rolling up those shirt sleeves like a prerequisite to being president 
[00:52:30]  is being able to work on a car.  Oh, yeah.  Like, it's just...  What is campaigning?  Everybody does that.  Senator Kerry reporting for duty.  Reporting for duty.  Yeah!  Yeah!  His shirt sleeves are rolled up.  He's going to get to work.  What is it...  What is he doing that you've got to roll your sleeves up?  Where did he do that reporting for duty?  That's douche-chewing.  That was the worst line.  What, four years ago, right?  Yeah, that's when he was... 
[00:53:00]  That was his subtle way of attacking George Bush, who allegedly, you know, was in the National  Guard and took off after that weekend.  And he actually was in Vietnam.  But where did he do it?  He was at the convention for you.  He did the salute.  He saluted and everything.  And he really...  He was so hokey.  Do we have that?  I would love to hear it.  Yeah, Shirley Temple had a more convincing salute.  That's right.  Yes, sir!  I love your take on the convention.  Oh, it's horrible.  They can say whatever the hell, you know? 
[00:53:30]  You're all going to be a millionaire.  That's what we need to do.  We get health care for everyone!  Yay!  Yeah, I'd like to see that one.  I'm still trying to figure out how they're going to make that happen.  My opponent says...  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Let's be fair here.  I respect his duty, his service to this country.  Boo!  Boo!  No, no, no, no.  He served this country.  He served this country. 
[00:54:00]  But he is not about change, and that's what I'm about, is change.  Yay!  Yeah!  Ugh.  Hour and a half of that.  Before the douche you're supposed to vote for even comes out there.  Yeah.  There's 20 people telling you how great he is.  It's like a World Series game.  All of a sudden, you know, you have to stay up to, what, one to finally see the guy?  Yeah, finally see the payoff.  Everybody's standing on the first base line. 
[00:54:30]  Half that.  Hey, Jimmy, where you at with this Obama slip-up?  It's so stupid.  Yeah.  So stupid to say something that dumb.  He screwed up.  I think he's trying to be something he's not.  It was a dumb example.  Oh, she is a pig, dude.  It's a dumb example, but it is, no matter what you say, he was absolutely directing that  towards her statement about the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull. 
[00:55:00]  She said lipstick.  All of a sudden, you know, a pig wearing lipstick.  It's the same.  I thought he was saying that.  I thought he taught, I sound like the guy in Goodfellas.  I thought she said you didn't want it.  No, I thought you were wearing the lipstick.  I thought he was basically saying because his whole BS thing is change, and now they're  trying to hijack change, and he's just saying, like, you know, you can put lipstick, I'm saying  their policies are still piggish.  They're going to steal from you. 
[00:55:30]  A pig is actually considered a greeting.  Dude, no effing way.  There are 20 other examples he could have used for the same analogy.  You can put more lipstick on a whore.  Well, you could have done the, you know, the crappy car analogy.  Don't honk your horn.  There are just other analogies.  He used the lipstick line as a response to her saying, you know, she wears lipstick, and  that's the difference between the hockey mom and the pit bull, which, you know, goes in.  I think he's saying you got a woman there to try to balance out, act like you're liberal 
[00:56:00]  too.  Now you're hijacking our change, saying you guys are actually greedy, conservative pigs.  Well, that's exactly what it meant, but he directed it towards her.  He knew.  You heard the applause it got.  It got the applause because he was calling her a pig.  That's why.  And then how about the other side?  I've never been good at the layers.  I've watched movies at face value.  This is fantastic, this whole thing.  I didn't get Eyes Wide Shut.  I was like, I don't get it.  Really? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I didn't either.  No.  Listen, as we continue with politics, we got a new McCain ad, which is...  Well, I just want to get on the other side, which is saying that the Republicans constantly  saying that Obama was a community organizer and then laughing about it, like that was his  big political stand, his political experience was being a community organizer, and they keep  using that over and over and laughing about it.  And their camp, Obama's camp, is now calling that a veiled racist term. 
[00:57:00]  They are saying that saying he is a community organizer and then goofing on that as being  his only experience before he got elected is racist.  Oh, they're saying he doesn't have any experience.  Yeah, but they're also saying that the community organizer, just to say that, is being racist.  Which means that whenever they say community, they mean black.  That's what they're saying, that black people mean that...  Yeah.  That's what they're saying, he organized like the Watts riot, is that what they're saying?  He was a community organizer. 
[00:57:30]  Whatever that means.  I don't even know what it means.  It's all stupid.  That terrorist fist bump.  Yeah.  That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Oh, the stupid fist.  I just think it was douchey.  No husband and wife does that.  Stop it.  Should have frigging dipped his fist in lard before he walked up to her.  A nice Caligula ring.  Caligula, hello.  What's the line he says before he does that?  In the name of the people of Rome.  Whammo.  Hey, this is going to get people talking. 
[00:58:00]  Chris Rabb, a regular, he's trucking somewhere in the United States.  He writes, trust me, a middle America could care less about a woman's opinion over a man's black or not.  Nope.  That'll get people to talk.  Sorry.  Well, we'll see what the people say when they call the show now.  Middle America.  Hey, listen.  You got to hear this.  You got to hear this.  You're middle America.  You live in Long Island.  I'm middle Island.  All you got to do is just get out of a major city.  You run into you gun-toting crazies.  Yeah, that's me.  You got to hear this new McCain ad. 
[00:58:30]  New McCain ad that's getting a little bit of a buzz today.  It plays right into what we think of these political ads when they start getting ridiculous.  Right.  Listen to this.  Education Week says Obama hasn't made a significant mark on education.  That he's elusive on accountability.  A staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.  Obama's one accomplishment?  Legislation to teach comprehensive sex education to kindergartners.  Learning about sex before learning to read? 
[00:59:00]  Barack Obama.  Wrong on education.  Wrong for your family.  All right.  They're off and running.  I'm John McCain.  They are.  Wow.  That's awesome.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because it's a situation wrong for your family.  I'm John McCain, and I approve this message.  Now, I know you're a McCain supporter, but come on, Ann.  No.  Come on.  They're off and running.  Bravo.  More mudslinging, the better.  I love ads like this.  So, we're to believe that he wants kids to learn, kindergartners, to learn about sex before 
[00:59:30]  they learn how to read?  Sex education.  He wants them to know about sex before they can read.  Isn't it like on every bill, if you sign any bill, there's always like 9,000 things attached  to it?  Something in there.  This was a bill that was aimed at, I think, teaching school children about, oh, it might  actually have even been some kind of sexually transmitted diseases or something.  And I believe he wanted some way to start it in kindergarten. 
[01:00:00]  But I'm not exactly sure.  But it wasn't like walking.  They present it in a way where, like, Ron Jeremy is going to walk in, the hog comes  out, and hey, kids, look.  Like, the teacher goes, what's time to read?  And he's going, no reading.  Yes.  Pornography.  It's so silly.  It really is dumb.  They got to redo how they do the bills in Washington, because that's where all this stuff comes from, 
[01:00:30]  like you were saying, Ann, you know?  Yeah.  Because they like about 10 out of the 20 things in the bill, and then the other – is it  Pork Barrel it's called?  Yeah.  Yes, Bill.  I just love the little kiddie music that they're playing.  Ga-dunk, ga-dunk, ga-ga-ga-dunk.  All right.  Hey, can we break out our favorite political ad of all time?  You're finding it?  Okay.  With the Eskimos.  Oh, yeah.  That was the best.  Oh, my God.  That was the best ever. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, for Jimmy.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm – I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty.  Oh, yeah.  He couldn't even get it out.  I'm – I'm – I'm John – you think he got an acting coach to help him deliver that line,  and he still blew it.  No, after it.  Right, right.  How bad is that? 
[01:01:30]  Just picture the biggest salute ever, too.  It was so bad.  Yeah.  And the bill thing, in effect.  Ah!  Yeah, it was – they didn't know what it – I think they sensed what was about to come,  and they're like, let's just shout him down.  I'm John Kerry.  All right.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  I'm –  I would love to see a video of that big, dumb salute.  Oh, it's the worst.  Oh!  They're parting for duty.  Another great one you got to get that actually bombed was Hillary Clinton.  And when she went on this big blah, blah, blah, and then her big slogan was going to be  enough is enough, and she just didn't deliver it well. 
[01:02:00]  I think I've said it on the show before.  She just ended.  She goes, enough is enough.  And people kind of – and she goes, enough is enough.  It was horrific.  I think it was when she was running for Senate here in New York.  It's horrible.  You guys want to go for a risky phone call today?  Bye.  Do you want to go for a risky phone call?  That's the question.  What kind of risky mean?  I'm just saying, do you want to go for a risky phone call?  That's all my fingers. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  Oh, screw it.  All right.  My fingers right there on the button.  Jared.  Hey, guys.  Glad I'm labeled as risky now.  This is great.  Yeah.  Yeah, what Obama should have said was her kid – you can change her kid's haircut,  but he's still going to be retarded.  Whoa!  That's funny.  I ain't going to push the button for that one.  Why would you?  I didn't say it was, like, risky to the point we got to, like, stop the show. 
[01:03:00]  It's a spicy call.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little spicy.  We got to go.  And had Obama said that, there would have been an uproar, but I literally would get online  to vote for him tomorrow morning.  I'd just stand there and wait.  That man has a sense of humor.  That new McCain ad, people are trying to explain that it's a bill that teaches kids  how to defend themselves from sexual predators.  Oh, sexual predators.  That was it.  So he means well, but McCain is, like, spinning it.  But Obama's going to do the same thing.  We all know that. 
[01:03:30]  That's what happens with these political ads.  He's already called her a pig, so.  And this gives us an excuse to play our favorite political ad of all time.  Actually, we got two.  Two in a row.  It's the Paul R. Nelson thing.  I miss him.  Oh, yeah.  We do miss Paul R. Nelson.  Listen to this, Bill.  Ten years ago, liberal lawyer Ron Kind was elected to Congress, and he's done almost  nothing in the Congress since.  And that's a good thing, because just about everything he's tried to do has been wrong.  Ron Kind voted to take the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. 
[01:04:00]  He voted to strip the Ten Commandments from our public buildings.  Ron Kind repeatedly voted for gay marriage and to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual leaders.  This guy, this is great.  The horror music.  Last House on the Left soundtrack.  And they, the gay marriage thing makes me laugh really hard, because it's like, you know,  over and over again.  Like, he's just obsessed with gay marriage.  Gays need to marry.  Ow! 
[01:04:30]  Sex!  Listen again.  Repeatedly voted for gay marriage.  Repeatedly.  Repeatedly.  Repeatedly.  And to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual leaders.  Take this, homo!  ...voted to let illegal aliens burn the American flag.  For Congress, Ron Kind is the wrong kind.  Oh.  Oh, hey.  The right kind of Congressman is Paul R. Nelson.  Ding, ding, ding.  This former Marine is a father of four who supports responsible values.  I feel better already.  Paul R. Nelson will work to stop illegal immigration, to end our dependence on foreign oil, to win 
[01:05:00]  the war on terror, and to defend traditional marriage.  Trying to get rid of those queers.  And I approve of this message.  And that's the thing for by Paul R. Nelson.  We have to hear the, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I approve this message.  Message.  The former Marine?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Hey, the voters went against the former Marine, and they were all about the gay marriage.  They loved Ron Kind.  And the homosexuals.  Ron Kind is the wrong kind.  They must have loved it when someone said, his name is Ron Kind. 
[01:05:30]  You know, we could say Ron Kind.  You're a genius!  They wanted homosexual Boy Scout leaders over the X-Rite.  And I love how they word the, he voted to allow illegal immigrants to burn the American flag.  Like, that's some kind of a weird thing where it's like, anyone can just kind of protest  or use symbolism and stuff.  It didn't say, illegal aliens are allowed to burn the American flag. 
[01:06:00]  Where's the pen?  Where's my pen?  I gotta sign this.  It was a one sentence bill.  Yeah, that was it.  And then we got, that's not even the best one.  That was the runner-up.  Oh, yeah.  This is the one with the Eskimos and stuff, I believe.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day, what kind of congressman would try  to gut military spending?  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need  to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex. 
[01:06:30]  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study  the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease, Ron Kind spent your money to study  the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, transgendered, and two-spirited  Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies with  probes connected to their genitalia. 
[01:07:00]  Ron Kind pays for sex, but not for soldiers.  If Ron Kind had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve this message.  Imagine all those allegations were the truth.  Oh, that he's just a sex-crazed maniac.  How insane is that?  I was trying to figure out, what was the swamp noise for?  Like the soundtrack? 
[01:07:30]  Was that because he was talking about Vietnam?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe that was it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  God, is that...  Those are two great political ads, and he lost by...  Oof, did he lose.  It wasn't even close.  No.  They loved...  We endorsed Paul R. Nelson, though.  We called him up.  We had him on the show.  Yeah, we loved him.  On the phone.  Yeah.  We're like, Paul, your commercials.  We love them.  Thank you.  We were obsessed with Paul R. Nelson.  We had the old...  But it was...  Yeah, it was a landslide victory for the Ron Kind.  Yeah, Ron Kind smashed it. 
[01:08:00]  Do you remember Paul R. Nelson's day job?  He was like some real estate salesman.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And his campaign heard that we were talking about him, and they sent us a box of t-shirts  and stickers, and it was like getting a box of goodies from a major celebrity.  We couldn't wait to open up the...  Oh, yeah.  We booked that weekend.  ...t-shirts and stickers.  Oh, it was great.  Stan wound up getting a Paul R. Nelson security shirt.  It was the coolest thing.  It's a security on the back, Paul R. Nelson on the front.  Where was he from?  From what state was he running in?  Where the hell was he from? 
[01:08:30]  I think it was Wisconsin, right?  Yeah, somewhere like that.  I'm pretty sure.  I was going to say...  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, very good.  Paul R. Nelson.  Well, but...  I approve.  McCain kind of did this...  Kind of went down that road, so...  Yeah.  They're going to get good as we get closer to the election.  Love the mudslinging.  McCain, St. Obama wants kindergartners to learn about sex before they read.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Bill Burr in studio.  The DVD comes out Tuesday.  What do I...  Why?  Sorry.  Why do I do this?  September 16th.  All right.  More with Bill Burr and more of your phone calls, and we got a great Sarah Palin thing 
[01:09:00]  that a guy made.  Oh, yeah?  Ah.  What is it?  I'll explain after the break.  All righty.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  Awesome boobits.  For the people out there, uh, whipping out Wednesday, you know the deal, I hope.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  The power of Christ compels you!  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now. 
[01:09:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  Right about now.  Right about now.  Right about now.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Thank God almighty.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson 
[01:10:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show  Bill Burns studio  I have to inform you  that Paul R. Nelson  has been shot and killed  in Dallas, Texas  Paul R. Nelson  is dead  Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson 
[01:10:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  I'm Paul R. Nelson  Paul R. Nelson has left the building. 
[01:11:00]  We were so bummed that he lost.  We didn't have an inside.  We had to drop the whole Paul R. Nelson like that.  Yeah.  I wonder if he ever ran again or considered it.  We ought to find out.  We ought to do a...  What?  It was just two years ago, so he might be up again.  Oh.  Oh, he might be ready to roll again.  See?  Huh?  Is that a six-year term, though, or four?  I don't know how bad Wrong Kind did.  Yeah.  Maybe he screwed things up and only Paul R. Nelson can fix it. 
[01:11:30]  I like the quick segue from the name to Wrong Kind.  The Wrong Kind.  The Wrong Kind.  And he was confused at certain things.  He goes, he didn't pay for cancer research, yet he paid for...  Like he doesn't have a script right in front of him.  Yeah, he's conversational.  Yeah, he paid for the sex.  This show is actually half of his Wikipedia entry.  Of course it is.  And he's blaming us on the fact that he lost the election because we took vacation, what, 
[01:12:00]  a day before the election.  Oh, sorry.  He needed us.  Sorry, Paul.  We couldn't get the people out to vote because we decided to, you know, take a day off.  Sorry, Paul R. Nelson.  Yeah, we're all over his Wikipedia.  All right, Bill Byrne's studio.  I have this Sarah Palin thing, and we listened to it during the break, and because of these  dumb lawyers, they're taking the fun out of the bit. 
[01:12:30]  You could say the M word for...  Taking care of yourself.  Thank you.  I see it all over TV almost every night.  All over.  Didn't you play it on one of those political ads?  Had the M word.  Yeah, it certainly did.  Wow, thanks.  They let us get away with one today.  Yeah.  But there's a mock ad.  It's ridiculous.  The lawyers got to at least start watching TV and see what they're getting away with and  then realize that we could do the same thing on radio.  Radio is the holy ground for some reason. 
[01:13:00]  How about you start there, you dumb lawyers?  They love treating radio like it's some kind of a holy friggin' grail.  Update your knowledge.  They don't even have the updated knowledge.  Watch TV and see what's going on.  Yeah.  And start there at least.  You could do stuff on TV and movies and everything, but radio is this whole, but they said that  on the radio?  You can't just have a goofy show?  You should see the internet, man.  Yeah.  Stuff they're getting away with on there, man.  It's crazy.  That needs regulation immediately. 
[01:13:30]  Who knew chickens wouldn't burst when that happened to them?  I think the little insides would just explode, but they keep going.  Well, let's play this anyway and see if it works.  You know, we'll definitely play it unedited later on when we do our dirty show for Sirius  XM satellite radio, whatever the hell it's called today.  This is very clever.  Someone came up with like a fake, fake political ad for Sarah Palin.  All across America, people are doing it. 
[01:14:00]  I f***ed to Sarah Palin.  I'm a f***ed to Sarah Palin.  I'm a f***ed to Sarah Palin.  And I'm a f***ed to her right now.  Man, not in my car.  Finally, a candidate we can f*** to.  She's smart, she's spunky, and she is qualified.  I'm going to vote for Sarah Palin because she's a hunter.  I'm voting for Sarah Palin because she wants control of my vagina. 
[01:14:30]  I'm voting for her because she shoots guns.  I'm voting for her because she's kind of cute, and I think she has a fat ass.  And that's why she should be our next vice president.  I f***ed to Sarah Palin.  I'm f***ed to Sarah Palin.  I'm f***ed to Sarah Palin.  No, we f***ed to Sarah Palin.  Voting for what?  What are they saying?  This November, be sure to stop f***ing long enough to vote for Sarah Palin and that old dude. 
[01:15:00]  I'm John McCain, and I'm f***ed to Sarah Palin, and I approve this message.  That would have been better if I were in there.  Kind of took the teeth out of it.  The beeps are a bit much, you know.  A lot of them.  And it's a word you can say on the radio.  That's what's amazing about that.  It wasn't that bad.  It's just that whole word.  It's what the whole bit hinged on.  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it.  Other than that, I thought it was great. 
[01:15:30]  Other than the one thing that made it humorous being removed?  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah, slight technicality.  We like to give examples of what the lawyers are doing to this fine business of ours.  That's like saying, two beeps walk into a beep.  Yeah.  They beep it.  What else is going on today?  Talked about the Curt Schilling thing.  Oh, what was that thing with the black holes?  The thing.  The big accelerator. 
[01:16:00]  The Hadron.  Hadron, sure.  Large Hadron Collider.  Particle Collider.  Today that's happening.  Accelerator.  They turned it on.  They did it already.  They turned it on.  I think they turned it on.  We're doomed.  But the battery thing wasn't working, so.  What?  What was the deal?  Sweden disappeared.  A little black hole opened up and ate Sweden.  That would be great.  Wouldn't it?  Bunch of dumb bankers.  They only sent particles in one direction.  There's no collision yet.  So it's like a multi-billion dollar merry-go-round right now.  They got this thing and they're trying to collide, what, light particles? 
[01:16:30]  Some particles to make tiny little black holes.  And they weren't completely sure if we were all going to be safe when they turned this  thing on.  The scientists said that's poppycock.  They said that would never happen.  Well, some are saying that, how are you sure that when you turn this thing on, there's  going to be a black hole that engulfs the universe or whatever?  They have a machine that they can make little black holes?  Yeah.  Yeah, tiny black holes. 
[01:17:00]  And they can't get a car that'll do better than 30 miles a gallon?  Yeah.  It's such a croc.  Here goes Bill.  I love this.  We can't figure it out.  Yeah.  We just can't figure this one out.  The new hybrid Escalade gets 50% more.  I like how they do that because they won't even say it's still 21 miles a gallon.  Yeah.  They make you do the math.  Have you seen that commercial?  They're like, what?  This one guy's sitting in this big SUV.  He goes, why are they going to have hybrids?  It's got to be so small.  Wouldn't it be great if they turn this into a hybrid?  And he has an Escalade. 
[01:17:30]  And I'm like, all right, let's see how many miles it gets.  And they go, it gets 50% more.  50% more.  Yeah, so now I've got to do the math to figure out that it's literally like 22 miles a gallon.  Hey, is there a stat on line stump?  Highway.  I know.  Downhill.  Gas mileage over the years.  I want to see how much we've improved in the last 30 years with gas mileage.  Sure.  Oh, we haven't.  I remember in the late 70s, those Japanese cars.  Remember like they used to.  They were getting 25 miles per gallon and people were freaking out.  30 years later.  It was like 8 miles per gallon the cars were getting. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  10 miles per gallon.  30 years later, what are we up to?  28 maybe?  Average.  They moved up two or three miles per gallon.  They are burning cleaner, I guess.  But I mean.  They are.  Yeah.  The emissions are amazing what they're doing with cars because it used to just be.  I love watching those old movie clips.  It wasn't even video.  Just movie clips of a highway with traffic, all the old cars, and just a haze over the highway.  You would sit there and just suck in exhaust fumes. 
[01:18:30]  It's like the Indy 500.  Yeah.  But you would see it.  I mean, just a haze that ran straight down the highway, just hovering over the cars.  That opening Top Gun scene as the sun's coming up in the vapors.  That's what it looked like.  You don't see that anymore.  I just wish I could find, because you know there's got to be some dude out there that took shop class.  He's got to know how to do the 100 mile a gallon thing.  Somebody's got to know how to do it.  Oh, yeah.  And if you just do it on the sly to your car, and you don't get on a tree stump. 
[01:19:00]  Don't get the government in there.  Yeah.  No, you don't start telling people.  There's a guy.  You just keep it quiet.  That's when you get whacked.  That's when you get that umbrella tip full of racing in your whatever that stuff's called.  Yeah, they end up telling people, and that's their biggest mistake.  Where are we at, this?  In 75, we were averaging about 13 miles a gallon.  Okay.  And then we popped up in 1987 to 22, and we've basically been 22, 21 miles per gallon.  Yeah, moving down slightly since the high of 22. 
[01:19:30]  That was because of the SUVs really got popular.  Yeah, the 80s.  The 80s sucked, though, for cars.  Yeah.  Like, the late 70s and 80s were really like, oh, yeah, I want a Dodge Aries K car.  Oh, the early 80s were the most brutal.  Remember, and then they took all the great American cars?  Yeah.  And they tried to make them fuel efficient by just chopping them.  Remember what they did to the Mustang, what they did to the Thunderbird?  Yeah.  Ford was brutal.  Thunderbird was horrible. 
[01:20:00]  They took the Camaro and the Firebird and made them small, and yeah, they took all these  muscle cars and just, and then the worst one was the GTO.  They actually brought back the GTO, and it was a little piece of crap economy car, and  that was like the classic American muscle car.  That was really bad.  Like, maybe people just buy the name.  No.  No, no, they want vroom, vroom in their driving. 
[01:20:30]  Remember all those awful cars, like the Ford Granada and the Mercury Monarch?  The Monarch.  My first car was a Topaz.  A Topaz?  My father had a Ford Topaz, and I drove that.  It had like 96,000 on it when he gave it to me.  Ugh.  Awful.  And then I forget what his other awful car I inherited was.  I had real nerd cars.  Nerd cars?  I ruined everything.  No, no.  We're listening to it, Jim.  All right.  What is that?  Is that his Topaz?  That's what a Topaz looked like? 
[01:21:00]  What?  That's a Granada right there.  A Granada.  Oh, a Granada.  Sure.  Okay.  My grandmother had one.  Yeah, everyone's grandmother had one of those, or your grandfather drove around in  the Toronado.  Whenever a group of two bad guys would come to Hazard County, that's the car that they would  try to catch the Duke boys in.  Oh, just awful.  It was, yeah.  The 80s were full of just horrid cars. 
[01:21:30]  That was, because they wanted it to be fuel efficient.  Uh, but they couldn't figure out how to do that and make it look good.  So they just put that, I had that Dodge Aries K car, which was just, it was a fleet car.  It's like if you owned a company and your employees needed cars, that's what you would buy.  That later turned into like the, um...  Oh, they were such pieces of crap.  Remember when you would put it in drive, you literally felt like the shifter was going  to snap off?  Clunk!  And then once I'm driving and the air conditioning, white smoke started pouring out of the air 
[01:22:00]  conditioning.  I felt like declaring an emergency and I have to land immediately.  It was just full of like, from the air, I didn't even know what it was.  Shut it off, rolled the windows down, then the thing finally just blew up in Maranek.  Can, I was going to say, can you tell, uh, Bill, what, what ended up, uh, with the car?  Oh, I'm driving with the, uh, with the, uh, ex-wife before she was an ex.  Because I used, when we worked up in Boston, that's, you know, what I drove.  And I drove down.  So this was a happy time in your life.  Oh, yeah, yeah, real happy.  I, I, I used to, uh, drive from Boston down to New York on the weekends, you know, see 
[01:22:30]  the family and crap like that if something was going on.  So, uh, we're driving and I'm hearing like this tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,  tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick 
[01:23:00]  on it alarms and uh the thing just blew the engine blew right there i pull off the um the ramp i'm a  maranick and don't make it quite to the road so a tow truck couldn't tow me you had to call the  highway tow truck those friggin chislers uh so i finally just i abandoned the car there there was a 
[01:23:30]  uh uh u-haul place was it one of those flesh colored k cars it was a light blue just a light  blue like you see anywhere the white ones look like rolling refrigerators they swear things they  were horrible and i went to a uh a u-haul place and rented a u-haul truck for 1995 and just drove  that the rest of the way and left the car there you never maranick he never went back for the car 
[01:24:00]  why would i key to the story why would i the thing was i we went to uh something in boston you might  know it and it wasn't even boston i forgot where it was spooky world remember spooky world where was  that it was on the outskirts yeah toward worcester right one of those halloween places that they  decorate up and it's real cheesy white trash just crap and uh we went there we were doing some  appearance god-awful appearance there the funny thing is we're we're considered rock stars at this  point yeah little did these people know so we're hanging out for a while drinking after everybody 
[01:24:30]  pretty much left and we go out to walk to the cars and opa's driving a blazer i think at the time  yep you had your blazer so there was only the blazer and my car left in this grass lot but i had a park  like by the woods and as we're walking out opi starts cracking up laughing i go what he goes it  looks like your car is abandoned it looked like someone abandoned the car in the woods got the last  spot on the parking lot which was like in the woods i'm like it was just it it like the tires 
[01:25:00]  one hubcap was left on you know one big white wall and then just a black tire i wonder if anyone found  your car i wonder where that car is right now crushed yeah no car from the 80s like there's at no point  any car in the 80s that you abandoned people oh dude you know what that car would be worth today  yeah oh but dodger is k it's classic like whenever i watch those auction shows like it's all cars from  like the you'll get it maybe up to like the mid 70s 70s yeah the muscle cars or that that story 
[01:25:30]  kind of drops off and nobody's uh no one's really looking for those uh 1982 cordobas not even like  a z28 nobody cares no one cares uh there's a happy ending to that story anthony ended up getting you  know a couple forced a couple well i was gonna say a couple new models i was heading the same  yeah he traded he traded in a couple things for newer models yeah at that point i traded in  the uh the old car and the wife the old clunk i traded in the old clunker two for one and the car

[01:45:00]  it's almost like when you first start doing open mics like i would just wish i had tapes of those  like the stuff that i thought would work oh god stage it's the same horrid like that dude like  you don't you don't you don't wish you have it bill i brought in a demo tape recently you don't  wish you have it oh i wish you would have seen that oh boy and we might have to pop it up there  so you can see it um yeah just horrific i i wrote one letter one love letter and it wasn't even a  love letter it's worse than a love letter it's a please come back to me letter like she was done 
[01:45:30]  with me moved on to one of my friends and and it would just it crushed me just oh desperation is  always attractive to the opposite oh yeah oh it was horrible and uh yeah i thought maybe this  little letter with a poem in it would get it what was the poem oh i i went you know something  honestly i would i would tell you at least a line i don't even remember what i was trying to convey 
[01:46:00]  there i don't know was it original or was like i think roses are red no it was so hacky yeah it was a  rhymey poem um i think there was something about like uh us being meant for each other in a way  where like like uh uh i was like the hand and she was the glove wow it was so bad she should have 
[01:46:30]  been the douche you should have been the nozzle i was how awful how'd the letter start dear eva  it was so bad and then i even went another step i went into uh my garage with a louisville slugger  and tried to break my arm to get sympathy i thought if i had a cast on and came up with a good breaking  my arm story that she would be like oh and come back to me kick in yeah but i could i i could raise 
[01:47:00]  the bat up but and bring it down but can never really put put commitment into it so i ended up with  a big bruise on my arm like a battered wife yeah you always back off at the last minute i just  couldn't go through it like they do in the movies i couldn't do it you take like 20 off the head at  the last so that was that so i decided to chug down a bunch of booze and drive my volkswagen  through the woods until i hit a tree really oh sure nice why didn't you just put a fake cast on you 
[01:47:30]  method actor ah brilliant about the story anyway because then if she doesn't go for it now you got  to commit to it till it gets all four to six weeks or six to eight weeks of a cast those awful plaster  parrot whatever the heck they had on your arm remember you watching her making out with my  friend at the locker while i'm walking walking by with my cast that everyone's signing hey let's say  how to mark at philly market what a douche what do you got mark good morning guys good morning good 
[01:48:00]  evening i have a rather embarrassing story i love to sit here and make fun of jimmy but i really can't  knowing my history so back in uh in seventh grade i really really had the hots for uh for a girl in  my group we sat at like the group tables and uh her boyfriend who she was going out who was very  popular for a couple years um i decided he was going on vacation so i decided to write a fake  and pretty much cursing her off and telling her she's a terrible person and i put it in her locker  from him thinking for some reason that when she reads this letter she's going to be heartbroken and 
[01:48:30]  i will have a chance to jump in well obviously the letter didn't work and i'll never forget it one day  at our group we're we're writing a group assignment and she looked at my handwriting looked at me and a  complete look of disgust when she realized that i wrote the letter and i got my ass beat  he got busted like in the fbi yeah the first the first part of that phone call uh went through

[01:57:00]  on our phone line colin quinn oh colin hi guys hi colin hey colin how's it going well you were  just making me laugh talking about all the cringeworthy moments yeah yeah yeah what about  this one 10 minutes ago when jim norton said i need to know by mark anthony is an example of a  great love song well not necessarily a good example but i just meant if you're going to  write something to let a chick know that you like or at least be able to sing you think saying chick 
[01:57:30]  makes it tougher than that fruity statement  take your lumps and shut up how did we not take your lumps and quiet down how did we miss that one  how did we let that just slip by to know that's fruitier than your stupid thing you wrote 20 years  ago with the aussie quote well maybe it is slightly fruity but i just couldn't think of a better love  song i don't know no i can't either so you're right about that what do you think of his story 
[01:58:00]  about him uh queuing up the cassette as he walked by the girls house i love that one yeah  that was based on john on john cusack yeah we're someone who was calling him jimmy cusack why  oh the famous uh john cusack sign where he holds up the boom box say anything say anything right in  your eyes was it yeah yeah in your eyes only yeah except that he was standing there with a little fat  massive blue eye shadow terrible i would time it like when i walked by her house it was just 
[01:58:30]  nighttime with like nine o'clock it was awful was she ever looking no why would she be  she was hiding i'd like to rpg bill burr's flight to wisconsin today  he got against bill burr not happy that his career is taking off there  taking off he's going to wisconsin to a community college today 
[01:59:00]  he's taking off  no he's actually no he's going back neat attitude of like well the flight's 11 15 i better get on my  yeah he's pulling the old johnny carson thing look guys i gotta go  and guys it's fantastic then he looks at his fake watch it's just his freckly wrist  freckly wrist but you fire the rpg and you just hit the tail of the plane  so there's like a nice long time to think about it on the way down a slow spiral 
[01:59:30]  what uh colin uh colin what do you what do you think about the uh lipstick uh line that  obama threw out there oh about uh sarah palin yeah i don't know i mean i don't know i don't know  guys i got nothing all right good i was just trying to attempt something but you know you can't  throw a single line of a legend like me i i wasn't looking for any uh something hacky and horrible just  now i was just looking for maybe some real live comment from a real life person it doesn't have 
[02:00:00]  to be a a line from a comedian or anything like that yes it does it does it because if i started  trying to pontificate norton would trash me back for my beautiful comments about a small anthony song  i i leave i leave in shame which i'm leaving with anyway i think you're wrong i probably agree  with your comments because i think it was a silly thing that he said i think it was uncalled for  it's a bad it's dirty politicking as far as i'm concerned 
[02:00:30]  well you know what they say you know a politics is lying when his lips are moving  i actually have heard that woo edgy i think people are edgy when they go up to these politicians too  by the way yeah dude that that russell brand when he's when he went after bush i was like this guy  is dangerous well you know it wasn't just that but the the jokes themselves were just brilliant  yeah i thought i only saw a moment of him but the hair just got was like wow this guy's out there 
[02:01:00]  oh he just came groveling groveling to the hip-hop community audience nauseating community yeah it  always is weird not that foreigners on a postman and a nice white picket fence hello hello little  wayne here's your mail it's a nice community it is always it is always annoying though when you hear  someone with an accent just talking about american politics like they know i hate it it's always the  we hate it it's always the same point of view yeah we get it but not really that but it's like 
[02:01:30]  nobody's taking a chance saying anything about it so stop acting like you know you're in franco  spain sorry but i saw pans lambert yesterday i thought that was going to be a kid's movie  until the until that gentleman smashed in that guy's face oh my god some of the most violent uh  content ever very good petrice was very good at that petrice  of course no no i don't actually it was a big gentleman the big fat big fat frog 
[02:02:00]  hey what are you gonna go i'm going to the premiere of the new pacino de niro movie tonight  what do you think of them apples oh boy boy i'd love to see those two get in an argument  yeah hey what are you talking about big argument look but don't touch touch don't taste  happen to him god he stinks now can you do the oh he sucks now can you do the old uh al pacino 
[02:02:30]  the old pacino was like a good actor he was uh convincing when it was like that man is luca  brasi he works for my father and it was like a nice low delivery and then it turned into well god  has a practical job for us all what happened when when did he start doing that 
[02:03:00]  sucks now how do you have fun to watch no he is fun to watch him and de niro and de niro is not  even when was the last good movie he made what was ronan  ronan i don't know when he delved into comedy it's just like stop king of comedy was great  well no king of comedy was fantastic but when he's doing like you know meet the falkers and and  can we pull the uh emergency brake on norton thinking king of comedy is a comedy it's a funny 
[02:03:30]  movie but it's not a comedy you fool but he still delved into comedy you're a fool quiet no i won't  just because he modeled the material after what you were doing i happen if anybody's close to his  performance there it's you jersey boy hey you know i'm a fellow in new jersey i was there before it was  a felony i want to see an early tape of you and me i guarantee your act looks exactly like his  first of all i don't like the fact that i said it was you and then you go no it's you but in this 
[02:04:00]  case it's legitimate it's not legitimate i happen to be from new jersey that was the only thing we had in  common and you also ended with an enema bag on your head no i didn't i would carry it and i would  remove it from the bag and i would go i actually had to stand online and buy this thing  he punched me in the stomach and i throw up on my shoes  that was a bad end when i threw up on my shoes i thought finally i'm a man  don't you want to graduate oh yeah the stand-up portion of that is a little hard to watch 
[02:04:30]  but he wasn't as awful as you expect him to be having never done comedy on national television  that was the great part like and it wasn't good but it was like it wasn't as horrendous as you  expect yeah no that was kind of the fun part of that my pride and joy but it's for you my pride and  joy oh yeah jerry jerry that's all right i'll be twice as famous as you we got we got this listen to 
[02:05:00]  this oh you don't have it touch but don't taste taste don't swallow and while you're jumping from  one foot to the next what does he do it he's laughing is sick oh that was beefed he's a sadist  he's an absentee landlord worship that never better to reign in hell than serve in heaven is that it 
[02:05:30]  why not is that me or colin or you i just was in it since the whole thing began this is him  practicing his lines with some intern has been inspired to have i cared about what he wanted and  i never judged him why because i never rejected him in spite of all his imperfections i'm a fan of  man i'm a humanist maybe the last humanist i got it i'm a fan of man i honestly that sounded like 
[02:06:00]  norton when he was debating the second amendment with that guy yesterday i actually like that rant  though i like that the rant is good look just as he's overacting it's still great some of those  movies it was incentive woman would have been so boring if he wasn't overacting in that movie yeah  but that's not a good example he really souped it up i just want to know what happened he was he  he was look at him in the godfather he's an angry guy he never raises his voice that much 
[02:06:30]  what he wanted to keep doing that same performance he's not a one-note johnny you know no but you know  be the what are you stuttering because i'm brilliantly correct  you are you are colin what am i gonna say  norton never gave you my message but i have a friend who has quite the little collection of  armory so if you're in oh i always like that stuff i'm a big fan of the era i'm a fan of armory  how about uh dog day afternoon was a great performance but still not that kind of uh 
[02:07:00]  soft low-key voice well i just kind of feel like you know it's presumptuous if you got to be judging  old al i'm not judging old al performance i'm going to see him tonight with denira that played two  cops i'll bet you that one of them's doing something he shouldn't be just because  you've got you know tickets to the premiere and the way new jersey uh you know opening when i get  nothing of course not because i'm going to the ziegfeld hopefully uh hopefully bobby d will make a 
[02:07:30]  little speech you know he's always funny well we have to i'm a but who is more of a new yorker  or a bull that will rage like me  whenever he speaks publicly he's so awful he's a terrible public speaker  that was all i had on that i don't know why i i i love your deniro it's because no one does that 
[02:08:00]  deniro impression they'll do the you talking to me one because well he'll use that but in it like a  corny time like he'll have the glasses and he'll be in a yeah he's got his little specs on so he can  read and uh morocco obama should be the next president of the united states and that's me  talking to you colin stepping over you that damn thing you know what what's that that's gonna be a  noisy see how that hurts  i wasn't i was getting to a punchline and you just kind of jumped on me i'm sorry but boy it was 
[02:08:30]  taking our time well call sometimes three of them no need to rush sometimes i meander  i swear to god i thought it was over no that's how good it was yeah  he had the dramatic pause in there colin what was he gonna say well he said barack obama i'm talking  to you that was good no but he's yeah but i'm talking to you and he breathes heavy and he's  just uncomfortable oh he's a fool with his specs it's true he's gonna be horrendous unless he's 
[02:09:00]  got a liberalism at that premier tonight is not getting me thinking about it unless he's got a  good script in front of him he's just a dolt that's why they don't do interviews because  every one of them is just an absolute goose egg as a person they have nothing see when him  and pesci were on snl when they came on uh uh what was that brewer's show and the brewer did uh pesci  and then they walked out yeah colin was in there that's right forgot about that oh yeah and the way 
[02:09:30]  the way de niro was just kind of standing there when they walked out like just he was there  he didn't really do much yeah well that's what they say good acting is no what did you do in  that sketch were you in that sketch he was de niro in that scene yes i remember we looked across at  each other like wow you know like two guys having a moment it was pretty deep you and who jim no  like why the two idiots we are got these two great actors yeah exactly exactly well you did de niro 
[02:10:00]  do you still do him two crumbs i didn't even do a man i was just filling in oh it was just it was  colin's voice they just made him up yeah put some makeup on him and he's just like no i'm de niro  yeah you disrespect him a little bit a little bit although surprising the power you feel when  you're in his makeup if i believe me if i do get to talk to him tonight the only thing you won't 
[02:10:30]  believe me you don't even say this you'd be surprised how many people recognize me i won't  alan alder didn't last night when i went to the signer until i reminded him of we had met and then  he did remember me i can't hear anything when that opie's blasting the music at us it's time to go  yeah it is time to go though colin what can i tell you when are you coming in to visit us uh how about  two weeks why don't you come over to xm for a little while what else you're doing what are you  doing today come on in i gotta finish my script so i'm finishing at 11 why don't you come pal around

[02:13:00]  B-double-O-B  B-double-O-B  B-double-O-B  Bill Kaye from Philly writes, hey Opie, does the fact that  The virus is going to be offered on Sirius mean, you guys are going to be re-signed  Re-signed?  Re-signed  Oh, we're working on it, Popeye  We're working on it, Popeye  Cowbell Bell  We're working on it, Popeye  Popeye  We're just trying to get things  Things 
[02:13:30]  Things, you know how things are  We're just trying to get things right  When you're, you know, in the throes of the negotiations  Right  It's, you know, it goes back and forth  And then eventually you go, all right  I'm confused that press release came out with the word, the virus  Because we all agreed we don't like the name of the channel  The big boys over at Sirius told us that  So, you know  O-N-A  You want it to be the infection 
[02:14:00]  O-N-A radio  No  Or O-N-A  Dementia  No, just O-N-A  Opie and Anthony  Should just say Opie and Anthony  And Jimmy in very tiny font  I don't need the Jimmy  Get you  Very, very, very tiny font  No  Me, me  In a rainbow font  It should say  Me, me  That's Opie, that's Anthony  Me, me  Me, me  Me, me  I think that they would put virus and not change anything  If there's going to be a signing  I would think that nobody wants to send out a press release 
[02:14:30]  Saying we're offering a show  Then all of a sudden that show is no longer there  Ah  Oh  That would be very embarrassing  Hey, Steve made bingo boards  You guys want to play bra bingo?

I don't know I received a text so I was looking at it  Oh, you think you're that damn good, huh?  Exactly.  You can do radio and text at the same time.  Can we get Eric in here so we can sing Sexy Snack?  I'll sing Sexy Crack.  Actually.  Or Sexy Sack.  American Girl by Tom Petty.  The lyrics are in front of you. 
[03:25:00]  No, they're not.  Eric gave me sexy back lyrics.  Way to embarrass Opie.  I got American Girl then.  There you go.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say how to Hobbit.  In Indiana, Hobbit, how are you?  Hey, how are you?  I'm doing just fine today.  How are you, Dini?  Good evening.  I was checking the cinnamon shake out online, and that's pretty much the size of my wife.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, actually, I got into it one time with Jimmy on the phone a couple years ago.  He was making orca comments about big girls, and I called up and took offense. 
[03:25:30]  I didn't mean to make, was that, we argued because I was making fun of fatties?  Yeah.  He took offense and put it around his wife.  Oh, now, come on, guys.  Oh, that's funny.  Wild animal joke.  In that house, they don't write with a pen.  She lives in it.  Here we go again.  No, I had actually called up at the time for some sex advice because my wife is quite 
[03:26:00]  ashamed of her figure and is very shy when it comes to sex.  What was the advice we gave you?  Eat a salad.  I believe, if I remember exactly how it went, was to tell the bitch to get over it and fuck  her anyway.  Well, that's some good advice, huh?  That's just like Dr. Phil.  All right, thank you, Hobbit.  Sure, punch up.  There goes Hobbit.  Bye.  Do you want to do American Girl? 
[03:26:30]  All right, I've never heard this song, so I don't really know the tempo of it, so let's  go for it.  You know it.  You know it.  No, he doesn't.  I probably don't.  All right, here we go.  American Girl.  And I don't know the fact that he looked like the chick from Silence of the Waves, especially  in the mouth part, according to Anthony.  Not yet.  Here it comes. 
[03:27:00]  And...  Go.  No, no.  One more little roundabout.  And two, three, four.  While she was an American girl, raised all promises.  She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more life somewhere else. 
[03:27:30]  After all, it was a great big world with lots of places to run to.  That if she had to die, try to step one up, but...  Gotta keep...  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Look at what PalTalk's saying.  Yeah, they're all watching it.  Go ahead.  You're being watched.  I don't know this song.  Go ahead.  Good girl. 
[03:28:00]  He gets nervous when people watch him.  It was kind of cold that night.  He's getting a lot redder.  She's still alone on her balcony.  I'm a little hot.  I bet you're a lot.  This song's terrible.  Go by.  I'm 441.  Wayne's crashing in the WG.  Good job, Mike Francesa.  One desperate moment then, he crept back in her memory.  Mem-memory? 
[03:28:30]  And it's so painful.  Yes, it is.  Wasn't it close?  And still so far, far out of reach.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Take it easy, baby.  Make it all night.  She was an American girl.  Yuck.  That's it.  Wow.  Well, at least he gave it a shot. 
[03:29:00]  Did he?  I'd never heard this song.  He should be shot.  We got it.  Why?  You've never heard rock and roll?  I've never heard of this song.  A little rock and roll?  You should audition for American Amdahl.  What?  Okay.  That just squeaked through.  I found it kind of funny.  It wasn't a home run.  It cleared the fence because it fucking smashed the right field.  There's Temple.  All right.  Hip-hop Ron, Brabingo, the girls that called. 
[03:29:30]  Thank you to everybody.  How about this to Apple?  If you're going to have a phone that gets all these fun games on it, how about you fucking  fix the battery life, shit dicks?  That's the next thing.  That's the next phase, I bet you.  How wonderful is that?  Hey, Steve Jobs, instead of fucking walking around at 104 pounds, how about you fix the  battery life?  He can't help the fact that he's drastically losing weight there, Jimmy.  What the fuck's wrong with him?  He might have a little problem.  You know what it is, though, Jimmy?  I've got to be honest with you.  Hey.  You're playing a graphic game.  So what?  On there.  I should be able to.  It takes a lot of battery power. 
[03:30:00]  I play Scramble.  You know, that's for if you're on this shitter, let's say, and you want to pop up a game.  You'll do that.  You'll pop up a little game you play.  It's not like for hours on end, you could play the game and the battery's going to be  there.  I want to play forever.  And never charge.  A little nuclear reactor inside the iPhone.  That's what they got to work for.  Yes.  Or maybe something where you could just throw banana peels and some beer in, and it turns  it into energy, like Mr. Fusion. 
[03:30:30]  What are you talking about?  You're such a weirdo, Anthony.  No.  It goes on top of the DeLorean.  Does it?  Of course it does.  Who doesn't know that?  Doc Brown.  And, by the way, that technology will be available in just a few years.  Seven years.  In seven years.  Because that's when he, that's the year he went and got the DeLorean tricked out with  the Mr. Fusion.  Can we take a break?  Why would we take a break when we're talking about Back to the Future?  Oh, I don't know.  I love the way you can just move apps around, though. 
[03:31:00]  Isn't that funny how they all shake like Michael J. Fox, and then you've got to put  them somewhere else?  The loans, the loans, the loans.  Michael J. Apps, and you just slide it around.  Yeah.  Hit the button.  I bet he wishes he could just push a button and they would stop shaking.  My apps are shaking.  Help me.  My apps are shaking.  Ted, the no tech guy.  Why are my apps shaking?  My phone's broken.  That's an earthquake. 
[03:31:30]  My applications are shaking.  This phone is faulty.  Call me a lemon lawyer.  The lemon lawyer.  I have purchased a lemon.  Shaky apps.  You've got to know that somewhere in this country, on this planet, some dumb motherfucker  had to walk into an Apple store and go, I can't get my apps to stop shaking.  Why is there little X's by them now? 
[03:32:00]  Because you know there's just, whatever problem can be confronted has been.  I give up.  I'm P.  Okay, go P.  We're all P.  Let's break right now.  Can I tell you how happy I am with myself? 
[03:32:30]  Why?  I had to do a couple of promos in Derek's studio.  Yep.  And he had a couple of films of Doritos.  Yep.  And I had a couple.  And then I was so happy as I left, I just leaned over and crunched the bag.  And there's nothing that makes me happier.  Nothing worse than Dorito dust.  Instead of like a nice, nice, nice, nice whole Dorito.  Who's calling you, Jimmy?  Oh, my publicist.  Hey, you fucking piece of shit. 
[03:33:00]  Cunt!  You fucking cunt.  What?  That is the worst thing when you realize you knew her.  Oh, swim walk.  That is the worst fucking thing you guys can do or we can do to each other.  It's hard when you're on the phone.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I got it.  Oh, you run away.  Why are they yelling cunt?  It's just a thing we do on the radio.  On the radio?  You love story.  On the radio? 
[03:33:30]  And I'm your publicist?  Yes, you are.  Deal with it.  She knew something was going on.  I'm like, I'll call you back.  She's like, all right, all right.  All right, let's go to What's the Haps with Sam.  What's the Haps?  What's the subject of What's the Haps?  Praying.  Ooh.  Praying.  He went to Times Square where they were doing some of that praying right there.  Oh, this was my big tip.  Yeah.  Ah, wow.  Look at me.  Yeah, I heard on 10-10 wins on the way.  What happened, Anthony? 
[03:34:00]  Do tell.  Hold on.  I got to mark the day.  Well.  9-10-08.  Anthony thought of the radio show.  Oh.  After the show is over.  Ah, okay.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's keep track of this stuff.  Go ahead, Anthony.  You know what?  I'll keep track of when you think of it when the show is on again.  Now, Anthony, what was the motherfucking process?  Well, I was driving in one day and I was listening to 10-10 wins and heard that there was going 
[03:34:30]  to be a prayer, a big, what do they call it?  A prayer in the square.  Prayer in the square.  Yeah.  Where people would go in there of all denominations and just pray.  Pray for the earth.  Yeah.  Pray for whatever altogether.  Because prayer is like, I don't know, I guess if you have more people, it's stronger.  Yeah.  It beams to God better if you have more people.  That's it.  That is correct. 
[03:35:00]  But the first thing, the first thing I noticed was that while it was pitched as being all  denominations, it was certainly Christian.  Oh, was it?  Was it?  Not many Jews in there praying also.  Did you see many people praying with the Torah and the prayer cloths?  No, it was...  Muslims, a lot of Muslims praying to Mohammed.  No, all Christians.  Buddhists praying to that chubby little man. 
[03:35:30]  Bunch of Christians.  Bunch of Christians.  All right.  Bunch of Christians.  Let's...  Yes, get me out of that.  We talked to Leslie and Leslie got scolded by the...  That religion's good.  What's wrong with that religion?  Yeah.  Jews.  Towers.  Towers.  Towers.  Scientology.  Protestant. 
[03:36:00]  Pentecostal.  Episcopalian.  Luther.  Patriots.  Here's Leslie.  Agnostic.  I'm here with Leslie at the prayer in the square.  Leslie, what's the haps?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  Yeah.  What's that mean?  It's like, what's the haps?  Like, what's happening?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm not up with all this. 
[03:36:30]  No one else.  It's a made-up word, dummy.  No one's up with that.  It's my favorite part of the vid.  What's the haps?  She had no idea.  She just apologizes afterwards.  One of these times, you can't explain.  You just got to keep going.  You just kept going with her, boy.  Well, I came from Connecticut, and I just wanted to be part of lifting up this area and  the nation.  How do you feel about the massive beer ads and scantily clad women, unlike the billboards 
[03:37:00]  over there, right above today's prayers?  I think we see that all over in our life.  You just have to avert your eyes.  Or pluck them out.  If thine eyes deceive thee, pluck them out.  She sounds like Stalker Patty if Stalker Patty's dad didn't touch her.  Protect yourself from it.  Protect yourself from it.  Whoa, wait.  What's going on there, Sam? 
[03:37:30]  All right, Sam.  What the fuck happened?  There's a reason why we're playing this track, obviously.  What's up?  It got complicated doing interviews down there.  I was trying to find out what's the haps, but people were getting pissed off because  I was interrupting prayer and asking, what's the haps?  But it's not like I'm going to wait.  Some guys babble into the background over a fucking loudspeaker.  What I'm saying, there's so many people there, like, you can't take a second to just...  God will understand if, you know, he knows the haps.  Yeah.  If anyone knows the haps, God does.  And he wants other people to share it. 
[03:38:00]  Of course.  It's silly.  This woman, like, she can't hear because I'm quietly asking what's the haps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who was the bitch that was fucking ragging and coming over?  Was it an organizer of this thing?  She was just some fucking...  Praying bitch.  Praying bitch.  Praying bitch.  All right, listen closely.  You hear her in the background.  I think we see that all over in our life.  You just have to avert your eyes and protect yourself from it.  We get to live in this hour and this side, please.  I'm sorry.  You are giving us the gift. 
[03:38:30]  We'll be respectful.  Thank you very much.  Oh, you should have said, go fuck yourself.  You should have said, what's your haps?  Yeah, what's your...  Yeah, exactly.  When these religious people gather in large groups, they tend to get intimidating and  possibly violent.  So I decided to go against the route of angering people.  But that isn't Christianity.  That isn't like what the Lord would have people do.  Well, neither was lynching people, but that didn't stop anybody.  Well...  That's right.  You gotta take the... 
[03:39:00]  I dumped myself.  Did you hear that?  Yes, because I was going to start singing the Facts of Life song.  Yes.  So, is that it?  Where did you move on?  I was done with her anyway.  It's time to move on.  Yeah, fuck her.  Because she wasn't even telling me what's the haps, really.  No.  She didn't even know what it meant.  That bitch didn't know shit.  We meet Israel.  Israel.  Oh, that's a Christian?  Somebody arguing with a waiter over a tip not left.  I'm here with Israel at the prayer in the square. 
[03:39:30]  Israel, what's the haps?  At a piggy park?  What's the haps?  I don't understand that language.  What's the haps?  I don't understand that.  It's like an abbreviation, like what's the haps?  What's happening, you mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Well, as you can see, it's a group of people praying and reaching out to the city and the  people of the city of New York that need prayer.  What faith are you here representing?  I'm Christian.  Washing the blood of Jesus.  Do you feel like the people who are not Christian are wasting their time here today? 
[03:40:00]  No.  On contrary.  This is for their benefit.  Witnessing to them that there is a God that heals, that's saved, that's real.  That's it.  Holy shit, what a kook.  See, the thing is, they were saying it was for all denominations because they said-  Be Christians.  Yes, because the non-Christians needed it more than the Christians.  That's what he said.  He's like, no, this is for them.  It was Christian worship.  Right.  But non-Christians could come and participate in Christian worship.  And be Christian because this God, Christian God, is the one that, like, that's the real 
[03:40:30]  one.  Everyone else is just wasting their time.  But the fake God.  So they come there and they're in with the real God.  Exactly.  What if he's wrong?  What if he dies and goes to Jew heaven?  Wow.  Well, he'll get the wrong-  Rockaway?  Damn Norton.  All right.  Want to meet Betty?  Oh, Betty was the best. 
[03:41:00]  I bet I do.  Betty's good?  Betty's a wonderful woman.  All right.  Let's see what-  Betty.  All right, so I'm here at Prayer in the Square with Betty.  Betty, what's the haps?  What's the haps?  I'm sorry.  What's the haps?  What's the ha-  What's happening?  Uh-oh.  Well, we're praying for New York City and the nation.  And we believe that God can come in and can change situations.  Because the Bible said my people would humble themselves, seek my face, and turn from their  wicked ways, and I'll heal the land. 
[03:41:30]  God, what rap song was that?  Damn.  Betty used to get a hold of herself.  Hey, simmer down, Betty.  Just ask, what's the haps?  Yeah.  Is that a Lil Wayne song she was reciting?  She goes into a whole thing.  Yeah, Betty knows what she's doing.  Betty continues.  She was dancing on the sidewalk while they were singing.  No doubt.  No doubt.  Holla.  How about non-Christians?  Like, say, people of Jewish faiths or other faiths, do you think they need more prayer?  I think they need lots of prayer.  Because some people don't believe Jesus came. 
[03:42:00]  So it's important to know that Jesus has come and is coming again.  Because we wouldn't be Christians if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus.  Right.  Do you have any idea when you think he's coming again?  No man knows the day of the hour.  But we need to be prepared.  That's right.  That's right.  She doesn't know?  No.  But the idea was the Jews needed to come there so they could be prepared.  Please, welcome all denominations.  Welcome.  The Jews, come in so we can show you the wrongness of your ways. 
[03:42:30]  Of your ways, right.  Hello, Jews.  Take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth.  Listen.  Listen, Jews.  There was a Jesus.  That's right.  We are washed in the blood of Jesus.  Right.  Which is kind of scary.  That whole thing.  Terrifying.  That's like the second person that said that.  Yeah.  In the what's the haps.  What does that mean?  It means...  Just kind of washed in the blood of Jesus?  Yeah.  Jesus came and bled all over everyone.  Wow.  That's like 28 days.  Yeah.  Or 28 weeks or whatever it is.  Not the Sandra Bullock one.  The zombie one. 
[03:43:00]  How much blood does Jesus have?  A lot.  I think it's symbolic.  Being washed in the blood means that he bled for the sins of man when he was crucified.  That's what I would guess.  Jim knows the haps.  Yes, I certainly do.  He turned water into wine.  Yeah.  Some sausage.  A little sugar.  He may have to cook for 12 apostles one day.  11.  Judas can go fuck himself.  Fuck. 
[03:43:30]  Finally, how do you feel about like the billboards near here with the half-naked women and things  like that on them?  Well, you know what?  That's what the world does.  That's the world.  The world is deceptive.  The world wants you to stay in sin because that's the world's sin.  So I feel that that's their way.  But we still have to bring Jesus to them.  All right.  Well, thank you very much.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, boy.  What, man?  Did she have a fat ass? 
[03:44:00]  No, she was smaller than her voice would.  Really?  Because I pictured a big, fat ass.  No, she's an old black woman.  Oh, she was black?  She was.  I'm okay.  I didn't know that.  Yes.  Oh, damn.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I just thought she was fat.  You're losing your skill.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure losing my skill.  We used to be able to tell back in the day.  Well, there's what's the haps from the prayer square thing. 
[03:44:30]  Prayer in the square.  Prayer in the square.  Highly religious people are crazy.  They're all fucking crazy.  Yeah.  They're like, that's their whole life, which I think, hmm, that's an odd thing.  They're living their life here just for the afterlife, not knowing if there even is one.  That's what faith, I guess, is.  But, wow, that's taken a leap of faith.  Of faith.  Because you could waste your entire time praying and doing all this shit you're supposed to do, 
[03:45:00]  running through the fucking motions, the goddamn religious obstacle course you got to do in church,  touching your head, the sign of the cross, the kneel down, the fucking genuflect, the church aerobics,  and then you die and nothing.  And they say, heaven, the streets are lined with gold.  How uncomfortable would that be?  Very.  It's not comfy.  No.  How about cushions?  Cushions that never wear out or get dirty. 
[03:45:30]  Seat cushions.  Marshmallows.  Yeah, they never stain.  Marshmallows.  A little marshmallow road.  You can eat them.  You can just lean over, take a little bite of marshmallow, it grows right back.  Cook one.  Yeah, because it's got to be enough for everybody that's been here on earth forever and ever.  Heaven's really fun.  How does heaven fucking work?  How does it feed everybody?  Who built heaven?  Are they old?  When you die and you're fucking ancient, it's like, oh, I saw the light and then I saw my  grandfather coming up.  That poor bastard's got to be an old fuck the whole time. 
[03:46:00]  That means you should kill yourself early.  No shit.  You got the hot body for heaven.  Kurt Cobain is like rock.  Well, he's in hell because he killed himself.  Yeah, but that's where all the good people are anyway, right?  Well, hell's another one.  See, because that's what they say.  I always say if I went to hell, I'd have a lot of company and I'd look around for the high  fives.  Ah, you got her.  I'm with you, Jimmy.  He said, hey, all my friends will be there.  Why would I want to be in heaven?  Such a wild guy.  Yeah.  All I know are wild people.  Why would I want to be in heaven if all my friends were in hell?  Yeah.  I'd be alone up there.  What far would it be, though, if all you and your friends were burning to death? 
[03:46:30]  Ah, you're just looking at your horrified friend's face for eternity.  Just melting.  Like your friend's face you never want to see them make and just screaming bloody murder  for all eternity.  You know what?  In utter pain.  This is the first time I've heard it put this way.  This is the angle we need to take.  So we decide that hell is the place to be.  Yeah.  Because all our friends are there, but then it's a horror show for eternity.  This is just awful.  You're watching your best friend being ripped into pieces and then just put back together 
[03:47:00]  to be ripped apart again.  Yeah, just when you thought it was over, they do it again and again and again.  Horrified drownings, impalements, dismemberments.  Just burning in fire.  Like you're just sitting there on fire forever.  Forever.  The feeling of the highest peak of pain when you're burning.  That's what you feel and you're just feeling that with your friends.  But at least you're with your friends.  Is there a moment where you're like, ah!  Well, you're like, all right, I'm used to it. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, I kind of got used to it.  And then the devil comes in on his cloven hooves.  Hey, you quit screaming.  Sorry.  Ah!  Hey, I'm going to only tell you one more time.  Sorry, horse feet.  Right.  Oh, horse feet's coming.  I got used to it.  What can I tell you?  Yeah, because like someone that did something bad like a long time ago is still there just  screaming.  Cool.  Ah!  Yeah, just over and over again.  And then an eight-year-old woman.  Oh, God damn.  That's what you feel your whole life.  What movie is that from?  That's got to be Saw fucking. 
[03:48:00]  That's Hellraiser.  Oh, Hellraiser.  Hellraiser is the first one?  Okay.  Holy shit.  Yeah, that's hell right there.  Why is he wearing a Yankee jersey?  Oh, that's creepy.  That's why the riser that way.  That's creepy.  Oh!  That's some creepy shit.  He gets ripped apart there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, Frank Cotton.  All right, we're going to do line of the day.  I would hate to have hooks pulling my face.  No, that would hurt.  That would be like hell.  Booby Man writes,  This Jesus, he heals pretty good.  What else does he do? 
[03:48:30]  What's wrong with the lepers we got?  Walk on water.  More water, wine.  Wine, game.  May fish last.  Rise from the dead.  Rise.  Yeah, healing.  May the moon be rock.  Yeah.  May the blind see.  Crowded taurin'.  The holy grail. 
[03:49:00]  Forgive him for Easter.  Krim.  Holy water.  Presence.  Line of the day is brought to you by my blackberry.  Oh, no.  No.  I'm looking forward to the new device that you can do a lot of things on.  It's supposed to be coming out.  Sure.  Yeah. 
[03:49:30]  Carbonite.com backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any of your files.  Check it out.  It's Carbonite.com.  Promo code XM.  Here's a line that was almost good enough to be line of the day.  I'm going to the Rush concert with my girlfriends.  Oh, okay.  And then I find out her girlfriends had a penis.  Yeah, well, who hasn't made that mistake? 
[03:50:00]  That's great.  New people are going to be showing up on the Hoping Anthony show in the next few days.  Holla.  Runner-up line of the day.  Another one.  You're doing that same performance?  He's not a one-note Johnny, you know?  No, but, you know, be the...  What, are you stuttering?  Because I'm brilliantly correct.  No, it's just...  He slammed me on that one.  Yeah, Colin Quinn.  Colin.  He's got to come in and say hi soon.  Another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:50:30]  Here we go.  Did you throw some dry ice down on the ground?  Some smoke.  Have someone hold the light behind him, so...  Badass Jimmy coming down the street.  Dry ice.  Fucking Bill Burr.  It's DVD out, what, Tuesday?  Yeah.  DVD comes out Tuesday.  Allegedly.  No, it's out.  Yeah.  One more runner-up.  I'm a...  But who is more of a New Yorker or a bull that will rage like me? 
[03:51:00]  What are you doing?  It's the worst noise ever.  Seems to me...  Let's all do it.  See what it sounds like.  Get around on the mic.  Yeah.  Danny, help. 
[03:51:30]  That's just...  It's stupid.  It sounds like a nest of vaginas.  As they try to chatter and stick the room up.  Fucking vinegary, stupid breath.  A bunch of yapping pussies.  Nothing comes out because, mercifully, the voice box has been severed.  Well, now we gotta do it again.  Oh, god damn. 
[03:52:00]  Bunch of dopey pussies.  They're all trying to talk to each other.  That's all they can do.  Stupid hens.  Their fucking lips are bumping into each other.  Floppy one looks like almost just Snuffleupagus.  It's silly time on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:52:30]  It's ridiculous.  Fucking awful.  Here to help us introduce silly time is the silliest goose we know, Mr. Arba Dwyer.  Don't let it down.  Don't, don't pat.  Oh, shit.  All right, Arba Dwyer.  That's our bed to see silly over us.  Yeah, we're in silly time now.  I know.  We almost got out of here.  When you're making talking vaginas.  Let's do the talking vagina thing again.  Everybody on mic. 
[03:53:00]  Loud mouth.  What are you going to do?  It's just smacking your lip.  You know your guys' contracts aren't signed yet, right? 
[03:53:30]  That is true.  That's a good point.  That's a good point, Bob Eatman.  Is this previewing on Sirius yet?  Oh, shit.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Talking vaginas for eight minutes.  Nice.  I would listen to that.  Of course.  Rick in Rhode Island is suggesting Ted's vagina form.  Where would I go with that?  I don't know.  It just sounds funny.  It really does.  All right.  Are we done with silly time?  I think so.  I mean...  We now return you to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:54:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Generic ending.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  This is not good at all.  What the fuck, Sam?  I brought you in.  I need B and I.  Yeah.  Let's get Steve in here, then. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, and it's on the air.  You can't get by it.  Oh, shit.  Your clothes.  That was my first line of the day.  Wow.  That was Danny's first line of the day.  Hey, you broke your cherry.  That's right.  All right.  All right.  That was a good line.  That was a damn good one.  Right, Jimmy?  Yeah, so I just think that everybody better start behaving themselves. 
[03:55:00]  Yes.  Let's get the motherfucker out of here.  Yes.  That was a good Al Q right there.  I like that one.  Well, we don't...  But now it's the moment's past.  The moment's fucking...  We have to go back!  No, we don't.  I don't want to do talking pussies in a minute.  I don't want to do nesto pussies.  Yes.  Just a...  They're all...  They're like...  All opened. 
[03:55:30]  Waiting for mom to bring back a cock to shove into their mouth.  They're just in a nest.  Waiting for big mommy vagina to drop dicks in their mouth.  That she regurgitates.  Mommy vagina's awful.  Because it's like that I had a baby pussy.  It's all hard-lipped.  It's all...  Nee.  Take your bottom lip and just go...  Nee.  Sounds like a rubber ball that hasn't been filled with air properly.  Bouncing on a gym floor.  That's what mother vagina sounds like.  Just pukes up, chewed dick into the other little nest of vaginas. 
[03:56:00]  With a Hillary mullet.  She has a Hillary mullet.  One little dead vagina under the nest on the ground.  All righty.  For some reason, I thought vaginas were birds.  A little dead vagina on the ground.  That was sad.  A ransom note next to it.  A cloud of suspicion. 
[03:56:30]  A little baseball hat.  What a cowboy hat.  Yes.  Well, then there's another little vagina.  With a mull hair cut.  Hiding and being put behind the other vaginas.  When the pictures are taken.  Mommy is running.  Big fat clit that it can't keep in its lips.  It's wet all the time. 
[03:57:00]  Talking into anything.  Dummy.  Stupid cunt.  Here.  Here, steal this truck tire.  Put it under your shirt.  Fucking dolt.  Dummy. 
[03:57:30]  What a shock.  We wind up here.  Of course.  Why wouldn't we?  Driving circles on this show, don't we?  Really dope.  I've seen this neighborhood.  Yeah.  This is retardsville.  We just passed.  We were in tit town.  We passed through cunt town.  And now we're in fucking retardsville.  I'm going to set my nav for AIDS town.  That's the home button. 
[03:58:00]  We are just a bunch of doddering idiots.  Holy shit.  Redundant buffoons.  Fucking AIDS, tits, cancer, rape, repeat.  Fucking.  Jesus.  Horrible.  We're fucking.  We're all hollow.  We won't stop with take on me.  You open and close with it.  Somewhere in the middle, we try to talk politics.  Yeah.  Yeah, just to show that we're not total garbage.  Yeah, just to throw people off.  Big one hit wonder.  What do you think? 
[03:58:30]  Obama or McCain?  Yeah.  All right, back to the clit show.  Boy, as soon as she announced she was running, oh, she has a what?  Well, here we go.  He's a what and she has a what?  Oh, great.  Perfect.  Except for four years.  She's got a kid that's a what?  That's what I mean.  Oh, I mean, I just forget it.  Don't.  And I probably.  Oh, you headline of the day, too, you asshole.  You blew it.  You just got revoked.  You're going out on top.  No, actually, I don't know if I said that or I said she's a what?  Yeah, well, actually.  Let's get Kenny in here to throw Danny out. 
[03:59:00]  He's waiting out in my vehicle.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  All right, we're out of here, man.  See you tomorrow.  Everybody have a good evening.  I have a great out.  Yes?  It was real.  It was nice.  But it wasn't real nice.  Ah, yeah, this bus is heading toward a cliff and no one can stop it.  The brakes have failed and fucking, it's on fire.  This is Jim Norton and my Wilbur Theater show has sold out as we expected it would. 
[03:59:30]  So we've added a second show for November 15th at 7 p.m.  Tickets go on sale tomorrow morning, Thursday, the pre-sale.  I think you need a bullet to pass.  We'll go to Ticketmaster or myspace.com, Jim Norton.  The Wilbur Theater, it's sold out in a couple of days.  I am adding a second show for November 15th in Boston. 
[04:00:00]  Be there or be square.  You know, I'm still standing better than I ever did.  Looking like a true survivor.  Feeling like a little kid.  I'm still standing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm still standing. </pre>
