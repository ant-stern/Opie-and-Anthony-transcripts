<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous, fictional news report about a rage-inducing virus, setting the tone for the day.  Comedian Bill Burr filled in for the absent Jim Norton, who had been arrested the previous night.  A significant portion of the show centered on a heated debate between Anthony and Bill Burr about “Confessions of an Economic Hitman,” a book Burr had (partially) read, provoking insults and interruptions.  Steve, the executive producer, was absent due to his Prius malfunctioning, prompting jokes about the car's name.

The show heavily featured audio clips of people being tasered, including incidents at a UCLA library and a PlayStation 3 launch event.  These clips spurred discussions about the reactions of those tasered and bystanders, along with commentary on other news items, such as tornado damage and a man charged with having sex with a dead deer. Numerous listener calls were interspersed throughout.  The hosts brainstormed a new bit, "Taser Karaoke," a game show where contestants are (stunned, not tasered) while singing, further fueled by discussions about taser incidents and listener participation.

A phone call with Donald Trump promoting his appearance at a real estate expo led to a discussion about co-op boards, his building empire, and his aversion to changing diapers.  The show also promoted the upcoming eggnog drinking contest and homeless shopping spree, with a live update from “Keith the Cop” encountering difficulties with a homeless contestant. Audio of the youngest person ever tasered was played, along with further discussion about the PS3 launch and scalping.  An interview with a homeless man describing his living situation as a "four-story cardboard condominium" was included.

The show delved into the hosts' childhood aspirations, followed by a discussion about homelessness with G-I., a homeless man brought into the studio.  G-I. was considered a candidate for the homeless shopping spree and successfully recited the Preamble to the Constitution.  A news story about a six-year-old child tased by police sparked a heated debate, followed by humorous, vulgar commentary on the man charged with having sex with a dead deer.  A call from Marge, regarding a fire at her animal shelter, was also included.  The show continued to promote the Eggnog Drinking Contest and Homeless Shopping Spree, featuring an outside-the-studio interview with G-I. and another homeless man, Andrew.  The “Daily Dump Report” and the eBay report were also discussed.

A heavily profane and sexually explicit segment followed, dominated by G-I.'s intoxicated and erratic behavior, including shouting, spitting, and making obscene gestures.  Listener calls detailing graphic sexual encounters were featured, alongside discussions about an inflated eBay auction for a PlayStation 3 and G-I.'s alleged theft attempt.  Speculation about O.J. Simpson's guilt and violence surrounding the PlayStation 3 launch were also included.  The segment culminated in G-I.'s ejection from the studio after a physical altercation.

A segment heavily criticized Tyra Banks' *America's Next Top Model*, focusing on a segment where she experienced homelessness, highlighting what the hosts perceived as her disingenuous portrayal of hardship.  The arrest of Jim Norton was briefly discussed, along with a past experience distributing used toys in a low-income neighborhood.  A segment showing Tyra Banks interacting with obese teenagers was also dissected.

Finally, a caller discussed their family's struggles with weight, leading to discussions about *The Biggest Loser*, Carolyn Ray's weight gain, and Bill Burr's joke on the matter.  A caller, Shiana, described her poor health due to overeating, prompting ribald jokes.  The "Line of the Day" segment, a PlayStation 3 store robbery, and a satirical segment on "laughter clubs" were also included.  The show ended with mention of Big Kev's upcoming appearances with Val Kilmer and Adam West.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too rage.  Is this Christ five hours? It infects, replicates and kills this fast? These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. I wish to God they weren't.  There is no God. 
[00:00:30]  It's like some kind of horror movie.  Such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules. There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  We've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right, we're coming out. Here we go.  Shut up.  Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  I'm a little dirty. Wipe me.  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I could have used a touch more palaver.  Yeah?  Just a little, like, yeah, like a spoonful more of palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Savage animal.  I'd play that for Bill Burr.  Bill's here.  Bill Burr filling in for Jim Norton today.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Where's Jimmy lollygagging around today?  Oh, I lost track of Jimmy.  What the hell is Jimmy?  Still down the meatpacking district.  Yeah, we should start a rumor.  Jim Norton was arrested last night.  Soliciting.  For what we thought he would be arrested for. 
[00:02:00]  So it's no surprise to anyone this morning.  He should be back on the air Monday, hopefully.  In the meantime, Bill Burr, everyone.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Microphone sounds different again today.  It does every day.  That's part of the daily surprise of coming in.  Also, the daily surprise of what will work and what won't.  Yeah.  Apparently, we have some internet connection, but none for the poor people that usually watch 
[00:02:30]  us on Pal Talk.  Sorry.  Don't have that yet.  What's going on over here?  I don't know.  Everything was working last time I came in.  Everything was working.  Well, apparently, somebody came in.  Any reflecting in your guys' moods?  Yes.  You guys were upbeat.  Someone came in to fix everything last night.  That's what happened.  And whenever people come in to fix stuff, when you don't have any problem with the way  things work, but someone comes in to fix things, you will have a problem the next day. 
[00:03:00]  Everything works, but they feel they have to fix things.  And now, nothing worked.  That sounds like anyone who's ever tried to write a script for me.  Be like, yeah, the end doesn't work.  And then they just try to adjust everything up there.  To fix the ending, you must fix the entire story instead of just doing the ending.  That's wonderful.  Now, nothing works.  Yeah.  Well, we got lots to do today.  Yes.  And Steve isn't here, of course. 
[00:03:30]  Did you get Steve's email?  Yeah.  I asked.  Stupid hybrid.  I wrote back, did you check the tank to see if there was enough honey in it?  Here's Steve's email.  Here's Steve's email.  Oh, no.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Guys, I think I'm going to be a little late today.  I'm having trouble with the Prius.  The Prius, the hybrid vehicle.  It's hybrid gas and electric.  Let me tell you.  No more. 
[00:04:00]  I think it's cheese.  Damn it.  You know, I saved so much gasoline when it's broken in the garage for the third time this  week.  Oh, okay.  I'll be there at night.  Oh, I won't be there today.  A Prius.  Yeah, for our new listeners, our executive producer drives a hybrid car.  Drives a hybrid.  He used to drive a big SUV.  Steve.  Steve's like a big guy.  Yeah.  He fits in an SUV. 
[00:04:30]  He looks like an SUV kind of guy.  But he's one of these of the mindset of let's look around the room and see who I could look  at.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  Right off the bat.  Right off the bat.  I'm just saying.  Bill's like one of these guys that say, you know, look out, run for your lives and tear  your hair out of your head because gas is running out next week.  That's exactly what I say.  It's not a caricature at all.  No, not at all.  Hey, as the referee, can we keep this argument to five minutes today, please?  Of course.  And not continue it through every commercial break for the entire morning. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, my God.  What I got to deal with when Bill Burrs in.  I love talking to Bill.  Oh, these guys just go at it the entire time.  It's hysterical.  It's a lot of fun.  It's not just an environment.  We argue about other stuff.  Yeah.  He argues that I'm stupid and don't read.  Have you read that Confessions of an Economic Hitman?  I got through a chapter and a half and I'm like, this guy is the biggest lying sack of  crap.  The guy is writing a fantasy book. 
[00:05:30]  He wanted to be a secret.  He's on some stupid, like, government thing having to do with economics.  He read a chapter and a half.  And he thinks he's James Bond.  This guy had this James Bond complex where he thinks, you know, Confessions of a, what  is it, Economic Hitman?  How would you know?  You didn't even read it.  It's still sitting on my goddamn night table.  It was a stupid book.  Book stupid.  It had a cover and it interrupted my video game. 
[00:06:00]  I thought it was dumb.  My pal Anthony reads, Bill.  He just doesn't read what you read.  He's hopeless.  He reads Popular Mechanics.  If he actually, some people have been like, okay, it's an interesting book and they'll give  me somebody else on a book on the other side and I'll read that book.  I mean, it's not like I'm just like saying this guy 100% is everything in there is true.  But I mean, when you come at me, it's like, it was stupid.  Are you in a book club?  Am I in a book club? 
[00:06:30]  No.  And I'm not going to be made to feel stupid that I actually read openly.  It really is hard to turn that around.  You're stupid, you reader.  Our listeners don't read, so you do look stupid.  That's not true.  The fringe.  The fringe.  Yeah.  I'll sum it up.  I'll sum it up very quickly.  The book is about some guy.  He's going to sum up a chapter.  A chapter and a half.  No, no.  With his polluted viewpoint.  You didn't even read it, Anthony.  You can't sum it up.  What are you going to sum up?  I can sum up what the book is about. 
[00:07:00]  You could read the back cover and know what the book is based on.  It's based on this guy's job that used to be to go into these third world countries and  exploit them.  You did not read the book.  You read a chapter and a half.  Shut your face.  But I know it.  You're going to rip it apart.  You didn't even read it.  Look at you.  You're defending it before I'm even saying anything about it.  You're going to trash.  I'm describing what.  He's going to trash a great book that I'm not saying is 100% true and you haven't even  read it.  Do you realize how irresponsible that is? 
[00:07:30]  I read enough of it.  You know what you are?  You're a book burner.  I read.  That's what you are.  Well.  There's some great book burners in our centuries.  Go back and get footage of the Dixie Chicks when they had those retards with the steamroller  outside that Walmart going, whoo!  As they ran.  I bet you'll see Anthony in there.  That's me?  Just like Forrest Gump.  I don't think that's me.  Anthony made his opinion after a chapter and a half.  I have an open mind.  What's wrong with that?  You know what's wrong?  He's 63.  He's still playing Pac-Man every night. 
[00:08:00]  Pac-Man!  Pac-Man!  Asteroids.  Have you seen it?  Ugh.  Brutal.  The guy?  He's going to try to tear apart.  Used to be.  And I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  Do you even know his name?  The guy.  The guy.  This guy.  I don't know.  He wrote this book.  His name is irrelevant.  He's known as the guy.  Your opinion on the book is irrelevant.  I'm not even going to give an opinion yet.  I was telling.  You're not going to give an opinion because I was going to interrupt you the entire time.  What you had told me what the book was about.  It is a gentleman who, because of his job. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, this is what I told you the book was about?  Yeah.  He was a wannabe James Bond spy?  No, no, no, no.  No, that's not what I'm getting at.  I'm saying that his job with the United States government was to go to third world countries  and exploit them out of their resources by.  It's like an actor doing a monologue in an awful audition.  I'm just trying to sum it up quickly.  Just get on to trashing minorities so we can move on with the show with it.  Wow.  Why the anger today? 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  We've got to entertain these people.  Don't treat us like Philly.  He has jumped up outside.  You Philly hater.  Don't treat us like Philly.  Once again, I don't hate Philly.  Right out of the box, you're like.  I do not hate Philly.  Right out of the box, he's angry.  I do not hate Philly.  I hated those people in that crowd.  There's a difference.  There is.  Bill Burra, YouTube star.  Yes.  All right.  Enough about the stupid book, okay?  Enough about the book.  You gave him a book.  I'll summarize.  He read a chapter and a half and he couldn't be bothered anymore. 
[00:09:30]  That's all?  Exactly.  Couldn't be bothered.  Notted off.  Fell asleep on.  Burned the side of his face on his hot pocket.  And then that was it.  I liken it to a book about a park ranger, a park ranger that wrote a book about how he  solved the biggest terrorist crime in the world.  That's what it is.  This guy was a schlub, an economic, a bean counter schlub for the government that blew 
[00:10:00]  his position so out of proportion that he thinks he's a secret agent.  Oh, he's a secret agent.  No, he's not.  He's a bean counter.  He went down and took some money from some countries.  Anthony, if you read the book.  I read the book.  He never said I'm James Bond.  Oh, he totally did.  Oh, secret meetings and all that.  Get out of here.  What are you talking about?  The guy was a lying sack of crap.  And if I didn't get the job done, oh, what about that part? 
[00:10:30]  And if I didn't go in and do what I was supposed to do, other people came in and finished  the job, if you know what I mean, wink, wink.  Like he was the last line before people got killed.  What are you talking about?  Did you read the book?  You know what's funny?  Did you read it?  The first chapter and a half is his childhood, you jackass.  He's still in New Hampshire.  Screw it.  I wish it ended there with an Amber Alert.  He's full of fucking shit.  Oh, wow.  Billy's mad.  Why are you so mad? 
[00:11:00]  The guy.  Because you know what it is?  Because you sat there for eight years listening to these morons going, they don't like us because  they're jealous.  They don't like us because they don't like freedom, which was the most moronic stuff ever.  What?  At no point am I ever saying that if someone else was kind of, you know, in position of  power, they would be doing better than us.  All I'm saying is this kind of stuff makes way more sense than that Mickey Mouse crap  that I've been fed.  I'm not even debating that.  Here's a guy, you're sitting here talking about a book you have not even read. 
[00:11:30]  I read enough of it.  You read the back of the book.  Do I have to sit through an entire movie to know that it's crap?  Can you go through a half hour of a movie and go, this movie's crap.  I'm not watching the rest of it.  I didn't start this.  You wanted this because you were tired.  I absolutely.  You wanted us to kill the first 20 minutes of the show and now he's going to play the  victim.  First of all, I'm not tired.  Second of all, I said good morning to Bill Burr and you asked about the stupid book. 
[00:12:00]  We got a radio show to do today.  It's a great book.  Who gives a crap about the book?  Apparently it's a good book.  It's on Bill's reading list.  I agree with everything in the book.  I don't agree with the way the guy presented it because he comes off too dramatic about his  role in the whole thing.  In what, his childhood in New Hampshire?  Screw his childhood.  He read the first chapter in the back of the book.  I skipped over that part until he got of age. 
[00:12:30]  Holy crap.  I was going to talk about the PS3.  Screw the PS3.  I was going to talk about the PS3.  Good morning, Bill.  Toy for a bunch of capitalist pigs.  I'm really glad you did that because I didn't get to sleep till like 1.30.  So now.  I did, yeah.  Yeah, with the momentum of that rage.  Now you got some energy?  Yeah, I can ride it till like 8.  There you go.  You have your bagel and banana.  You seem like you're a little on edge, Bill.  You all right?  It's called lack of sleep.  Lack of sleep.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Hmm.  Should we start the show over?  No, I think that exchange was nice.  Was it?  Yeah.  It brought the energy level up.  I'm invigorated.  Well, these guys, Bill and Ann, have very different political views, if you haven't figured it  out yet.  Eh, a little bit.  All I know is we were talking about Steve's freaking car.  The Prius.  And how he drives it.  His hybrid vehicle.  And how he drives a gay car.  He's good.  He's one step away from being, who's that actor that just rides a bicycle everywhere? 
[00:13:30]  Oh, Ed Bagley Jr.  Ed Bagley Jr.  Waiting for the rest of the world to care.  To care.  I rode my bike over to The Tonight Show.  Did you?  Great.  Fantastic.  Is that why you're so sweaty?  I thought your movie stunk and you were nervous about hyping it.  Evidently, you're just sweaty from the ride over.  So Steve's not going to be here today?  No, that's the letter I got.  The email I got is...  His hybrid broke down.  His Prius.  His hybrid, for some reason, and he even diagnosed it. 
[00:14:00]  It's shutting off and then it's just going to electric and it's not using the other part  of the...  You know, there's a lot of people out there that want us to start driving the hybrids  and electric cars and all that.  And, you know, you got to help us out a little bit.  You can't name the cars Prius.  Prius.  It sounds like Prius.  You're a Prius for driving it.  There's not a blue-collared guy in this world that would be caught dead in a car that's  called a Prius.  Prius.  Prius.  Prius.  It ends in a letter that you can really... 
[00:14:30]  Prius.  You got to make the cars sound more manly, even though they're not.  They're not manly cars to begin with, and then you give it a name like the Prius.  The bear.  Say it.  Say it at home.  Prius.  Call it the bear.  Try to say Prius and make it sound cool.  Go ahead.  Try.  Try.  I own a Prius.  That sounds horrible.  I'm sorry.  Even do it with a D.  I own a Prius.  Yeah, but all the ferocious animal names are kind of gone, aren't they?  Yeah, they're kind of taken. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, all that stuff is taken.  Actually, they don't have a lion.  No.  A tiger.  Is there anything?  I get it.  They probably actually studied all that and ran it through survey groups and everything  and research, and it just didn't work.  The lion.  That sounds stupid.  Yeah.  I don't want to drive a lion.  Who's going to drive a lion?  So they've got to use a Latin name for a lion.  Right.  Will kind of work.  Something like that.  If I read and knew what that was, the Latin word for a lion.  All right, let's go to Jim in Michigan.  Who's on the back cover? 
[00:15:30]  You'd see it.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, Hopi.  You've got to quit asking, how's it going in the morning?  Yesterday it was Kenny, and today it's Bill Burr.  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  Yeah, I'm done with the how's it going question.  So done.  Thank you, Jim.  Stop playing the victim.  All right, man.  Shut up.  Don't go after me.  You knew exactly where that was going.  F you.  I did not.  Don't go after me, bro.  I'm serious.  F you, D-H.  Don't go after me.  Keep it like real.  You're trying to start crap that's not there. 
[00:16:00]  I started the freaking show, and we got into the book that you gave him to read.  It kind of came off of the Prius.  Yeah.  I threw the first punch.  Nothing to do with it.  I'm not buying it.  Well.  I threw the first punch.  I said about the Prius, and then I looked at Bill and made some kind of sarcastic, snide  remark.  It had nothing to do with it whatsoever.  I apologize, Bill.  That is my job sometimes on the show, but. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  I apologize, too.  I went, all right, we're good.  I always thought, let's take it totally to the other side, and then wait, Anthony, on  the opposite, the exact opposite, like, emotional spectrum.  All right.  I always thought you were sweetheart, Anthony.  I always thought.  You were a.  You can't even do it.  Great guy.  All right.  We'll take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:17:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Bill Burr in for Jim Norton today.  Take two.  I enjoy our heated discussions.  I just don't like being pulled into something I didn't start.  You weren't really pulled in.  Oh, yeah, I was.  See, he's starting it again. 
[00:17:30]  We got the latest Taser audio.  I love Taser audio.  This one is really, really good, but it's off, like, a camera phone, a cell phone or whatever.  No, actually, it was a camera phone.  Some Budinsky.  Because I think the video's up on YouTube.  I think I saw this.  YouTube.  It was a stupid reader.  Yeah, the guy apparently was in a library.  At UCLA.  What was he doing?  Not shushing?  I guess he wasn't shushing.  They had to shush him enough times.  Shh.  Okay, Taser. 
[00:18:00]  Librarian calls.  Ah, we got to taser this guy.  He won't shut up.  Yeah, what the hell was this guy doing?  What was he doing that he had to get tasered in a library?  He wasn't showing his ID.  He said it was his right to not have to show his ID.  Oh, they should have clubbed him.  That's my right, man.  Exactly, so they had to give him the juice a few times.  A lot of these college libraries, you can't even get through the front door unless you  have some kind of ID or you're a celebrity.  Well, he had it.  He just refused to show it to the guards that were asking for it.  Man, what is this, like Nazi Germany?  I got to show my papers, man. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Wait.  Bring in the stormtroopers.  We're going to tase your ass.  So he didn't show his ID and then he ends up getting tased?  There seems to be something missing in the story.  Yeah, that's America because it was Nazi Germany, but he got shot.  Right.  So consider yourself lucky, stupid.  He'd have killed you, you idiot.  He just got a little tasing.  That's all that happened, huh?  Well, the reason he was being tased was because he wasn't obeying their orders.  They were telling him to do certain things and he wasn't listening.  And they said, if you don't do this, you're going to get tased.  And he wasn't doing it and then he got tased. 
[00:19:00]  He sounded irrational from what I heard.  Yes.  And they were like, you have to leave or...  Yeah.  At some point, he must have tried to almost get physical.  Yeah, well, he was saying his argument was that I don't have to show you anything because  I'm leaving.  So what does it matter anyway?  But obviously, that wasn't good enough for the cop.  Not good enough.  Oh, at that point, yeah, he was probably...  You can't hear the actual tase, but you can...  Not on the first one.  But you can certainly figure out when he got tased.  Oh, yeah.  It's obvious.  Don't touch me!  Don't touch me! 
[00:19:30]  Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Here's your patriot act!  Here's your f****** abuse of power!  Stand up!  Stop fighting us! 
[00:20:00]  I'm not fighting you!  Complicated-  I said I want me!  I said I.  WANT ME!  Oh, my God.  You'd think there were a bunch of people in cubicles just going, shh.  Yeah, shh.  I'm reading.  Hello, I'm reading here.  That's one of the, oh, man.  Wouldn't that be great?  You're right in the middle of writing a term paper you just hate in your life,  and then just something this entertaining all of a sudden happens on the other side of the library.  Right.  Just to break up the monotony. 
[00:20:30]  You got a great story to tell all your friends.  I was in, dude, I was in the library.  No, listen to this.  This is great.  That guy, that's just completely losing.  Did he say, did he say, here's your patriot act?  Yeah.  Here's your abuse of power.  Oh, shut up.  Just shut up.  Where's your God now?  Just leave.  Could you just get up and leave?  That's old school right there.  Nod, yes. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  The story goes, authorities say a UCLA police officer shocked a student with a stun gun in a campus library last night.  Police say the student refused to show ID and wouldn't leave when told to.  They say he invited others at the library to join in his resistance.  Did that work?  Well, come on, everybody.  Yeah, it's just like standing in front of a tank.  Yeah.  You ass.  Yeah, this guy is just like Tiananmen Square.  Right.  Just standing there.  Come on.  Rally behind me, people. 
[00:21:30]  That never works.  You ever been like in a line and the person in front of you is frustrated with the line about something at the bank and they try to drag you into their frustration?  Yeah.  But I turn around going like, oh, this guy.  Yeah, you believe it?  It points to the guy.  There's just a rule of thumb.  When I'm on line to do anything, everyone in front of me is a jackass that's going to take ten times longer than me.  And I like getting up to the line, getting everything done in a fraction of the time it took the five people in front of me to get things done. 
[00:22:00]  And I turn around and go, see?  See?  Two seconds.  That's all.  See?  That way you can justify all the murderous thoughts you have.  And then that way the next guy that's behind the guy that's next can get really pissed if the next guy takes too long.  Because then they can look and go, what happened?  The other guy went to two seconds.  I do that at the airport.  It breeds dissension.  You're not going to make a difference.  Nine.  People are going to take their time no matter what you do.  Speaking of lines, so much for lines as far as getting the PS3s. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  You see the video this morning?  Yeah.  All these people waiting on line for, what, two or three days?  They opened the doors.  Days.  They had tents.  They opened the doors at midnight, and everyone just converged at the same time.  Yeah, they all rushed in.  And people that didn't have to wait on line for two or three days were kind of just mingling about.  As soon as they opened that door, they all just rushed for the door.  Because there's no – it's not a ruling on that one.  If you're an idiot who's sitting there for four days, three days, whatever, waiting in a tent on a line, when they open those doors, you can walk right in. 
[00:23:00]  If you're standing there, you just walk right in.  You're cutting line.  There's no – it's not a movie theater.  It's a store, you jackass.  Right.  You're the idiot that stayed here for four days.  Yeah, what is the rule on that?  There is no rule.  Let us put those nerds who wait for the next Harry Potter book.  Yeah.  There's no rule.  There's no rule.  Once that door is open, you're in.  If you notice, though, book readers will walk in orderly.  Yeah, in an orderly fashion.  Evil game players.  They won't rush, but the gamers will beat each other over the head for it. 
[00:23:30]  A little different, Bill.  A little different.  Yeah.  I'm still looking for a PS3.  We want to smash a PS3 today.  Good luck.  With a sledgehammer in front of everybody.  I would love to see somebody generously bring one, but –  I have faith.  I think one of the listeners will bring one by today.  It's a tough item.  We'll see what happens.  All right.  Still looking for that PS3 later on this morning.  All right, so he invited others at the library to join in his resistance, and when a crowd gathered, the officer used a stun gun on him. 
[00:24:00]  The crowd was gathering to look at this dope.  Yeah, they were just watching.  And one person caught the incident on a video phone with footage showing the stunt student screaming on the computer lab floor.  Thank God.  The student was arrested for a resisting arrest and obstructing a police officer.  He was later released on his own recognizance.  For some reason, he sounded like he was, like, 35.  He didn't sound like a kid.  Yeah.  He was so belligerent.  Yeah.  Here's the second clip, by the way.  And the video's up on YouTube.  Hold on a minute. 
[00:24:30]  Go!  Get up!  Stand up!  Get up!  Go!  Get up!  Up!  Stand up!  Up!  All right, come stand up!  Go!  Get back again!  Look!  Get up!  Go!  Stand up!  Look!  You gotta stand here!  Look!  You gotta stand here!  I'll leave!  I'll leave!  I said I would leave!  Stand up!  Stand up!  Stand up!  I said I would leave!  At first, you didn't.  You don't understand that at that point, it's too late. 
[00:25:00]  It's too late to leave.  Once the cops show up, you're getting, at the very least, twisted up.  Yeah.  And once you're tasered, you're not leaving.  Now you are being...  Have you ever tasered somebody and then let them go?  You don't.  At that point, you're being arrested.  There's no more leaving.  Yeah.  The best I can get.  It's like being shot.  I dropped my gun.  You shot me in the leg.  Let me just go home.  The robbery's over.  All right. 
[00:25:30]  Ah, Tony, we can take care of this.  How annoying is that?  Like, did you hear that girl in the background who started going, that's so wrong?  Yeah.  Like, how annoying is that for, uh, I'm trying to wait for the, uh, Keith, like, have you  ever been doing, yeah, you're like watching the TV over there.  Like, you ever been, like, someone's, someone is acting like this, you have to taser them  or whatever, mace them or whatever, and then people are showing up, like, after whatever  they did happen and they're just kind of standing there like that girl going, that's 
[00:26:00]  so wrong.  Tony, you get the liberals all the time, especially in the city.  It's the worst.  Tell them to shut up and move along or you'll get it next.  Just tase you.  I had a guy stole my bicycle.  I was, you know, doing bike patrol one day and I stopped to get a cup of coffee at about  two o'clock in the morning.  Some drunk guy jumped on my bicycle, held off with the bicycle and I put it over the  radio and he ended up getting, uh, knocked off the bike by one of the cars a couple blocks  away.  And then when we got up, we handcuffed him and he said, you need to do the same thing. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll just go home.  Yeah.  No, there's no going.  What's the worst crime anybody's ever committed and tried to pull that?  I'm just going to go now.  I think that probably goes through the whole gamut.  Right to the murder, rape, whatever it is.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  People just don't get it.  All right.  You got me.  Jigs up.  I'm going home.  You watch the shows like the Dateline Predator special all the time.  They try to pull that one.  It's like, oh, please look.  I just, just let me go home. 
[00:27:00]  I'll never do this again.  And we joked about how these guys should have a sense of humor and let them go like, all  right.  All right.  You know, I look, I see it your way.  Or just, just not even get to that point.  Just go, look, you're not going to do this again.  Like give him that hope.  No, I swear.  I swear.  No.  All right.  All right.  Because if, if we catch you doing this again, there's going to be a problem.  Then we're going to have to continue the prosecution.  You'll never see me again, officer.  You'll never see me again.  All right.  You already killed two people.  All right.  I turn around.  I'll take your handcuffs off. 
[00:27:30]  All right.  Hey, dude.  Dude, he's actually going to let him go.  And all the other cops are laughing from behind the glass.  Sit down, jackass.  Sit down, you ass.  You kid touch her.  Like we're going to let you go.  Right.  No, we do, we do stuff like that.  Of course you do.  You do not.  You got to have a little fun.  See, that guy fell for the oldest trick in the book, too.  He was saying, stand up, stand up.  And every time he stood up, they'd zap him.  They'd zap him.  What you got to do is stay on the ground, put your hands behind your back, and lay still. 
[00:28:00]  Lay still.  Oh, you just got to love cops.  Yeah.  At what point do you start laughing after you do that to somebody?  You got to wait till you get out of the public's eye.  Yeah.  Oh, it's one of those things where you definitely try to keep the straight face until you either  hit the car and then you and your partner kind of look at each other.  And there's a clip.  There's a clip on YouTube, of course.  It's of a news guy outside of a house where there was a crime and police are removing evidence.  And this news guy, the cops waited. 
[00:28:30]  They planned this out perfectly.  They waited for him to go to his live shot.  And the door is behind him with all the get the F out of here tape around it and stuff like that.  And he goes, heinous crime happened here at this location.  Police now go taking evidence out.  The door opens up.  You see a cop with sunglasses on, a mustache.  And he's got this grin on his face.  He's carrying out a box with a had to be 12 inch long rubber piece of a male anatomy flapping out of the top of the box as he walks right behind the reporter out of the shot, through the shot. 
[00:29:00]  And he's laughing.  You just know they're like, all right, he's on live.  Go, go, go.  It was hysterical.  You got to get a couple of laughs.  Oh, yeah.  Thankless job, man.  Let's say hi to Scott, actually.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, man.  What happened to Jim Norton?  He got arrested?  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  It's bound to happen.  Let's say hi to David in Queens.  David. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I am looking at Don Imus on the TV monitor, and I think he's wearing one of your shirts.  He's wearing an Opie and Anthony shirt again today?  It looks like one.  Yeah, finally you got one.  Very carefully.  All right.  Thank you.  We'll check that out.  He's been bitching that he hadn't gotten his shirt.  Let's say hi to Chris in Boston.  What's up, Chris?  Laundry day at the Imus house.  He's wearing one of his shirts.  A big hi to everyone listening to us on WBCN in Boston.  What's up, Chris?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  One of the stores up here in Boston, I don't know which one it was, but the people waiting 
[00:30:00]  in the line for the PS3, the store manager forgot to pull a city permit to have a sale  at midnight, so everybody had to go home.  After waiting like a day or two?  I'm not sure which store it was, though.  Oh, that's great.  What poor cashier did he send out there to make that announcement?  Ladies and gentlemen, I know you've been here for four days, but we forgot the permits,  and she just gets a wrench upside of her head. 
[00:30:30]  Ow.  One thing about those taser audios that is really very consistent is the sound.  Just the sound of the air.  There's not one guy that goes, zippity-doo-dah!  Zippity-doo-dah!  You just know the sound of someone being tased.  Ah!  Okay!  Okay!  And then it's all agreement.  Yeah.  And it never starts...  Screaming and then followed by agreeing.  Yeah.  Screaming and completely agreeing.  And it never starts slow, either.  Like, oh.  Like, ow, ow, ow. 
[00:31:00]  What is this?  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!  What is it?  Hey, hey, hey!  It goes to 100.  Yeah, it's zero to 100.  Look, I think I should have the right to do...  Okay!  All right!  All right!  That'd be hilarious.  It's the attitude adjustment, always.  You could be the dumbest guy ever could be like a Harvard debating team.  Yeah.  Get in there debating global warming.  Well, actually, I have to disagree.  You're right!  You're right!  You're right! 
[00:31:30]  You're the cocky guy, Ant.  That's it, man.  The cocky guy.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you!  I know my rights, and I could be here whenever I want.  You are a civil servant that works.  Okay!  I'm leaving!  I'm leaving!  Please stop that!  Whatever you want!  Have sex with my girl!  You don't believe in anything anymore.  Yeah, it's just...  Everything.  Global warming is because... 
[00:32:00]  It's the oil-rich country of the United States.  I'm buying an SUV!  I'll get an SUV!  That's for everybody!  And I am prepared to stay here for as long as I...  All right!  I'm going!  I'm going!  I'm going!  I'm going!  I'm going!  I'm going!  I'm going!  I can't leave quickly enough!  Oh, that is the instant attitude adjuster.  That's why I don't understand torture.  It's just like, how quickly would you admit?  I mean...  Oh, and that's a taser.  Everybody in my platoon!  Which has actually been... 
[00:32:30]  You know, the taser, it's got to really freak you out and hurt, but it's been designed to  be as safe as possible and stuff.  Torture!  Oh!  Like what you're talking, they'll just run the gamut on your, you know, your naughty  bits, things like that.  The second they want to reach...  That would be the first thing I'd do.  The second they lay out the tools, I mean, anything you want to know.  Well, the whole platoon's going to be marching south.  We're leaving from this.  Where's the map?  Give me the map.  We're going here, and then we're going south, and we're going to turn here, and there's  going to be about 800 guys, and some tanks, and stuff, and anything else you want. 
[00:33:00]  You want coffee?  Oral?  What do you need?  As soon as he lays out the dentist instruments...  Yeah.  They slowly open it up and go...  You're looking at that and just thinking...  Those planks from the 19th century.  They used to screw the bolts in on Frankenstein's neck.  Still dry blood on him.  The second...  You know something?  You might, under the ultimate training, you might be able to take something to your shoulders,  back, maybe even your legs, something like that. 
[00:33:30]  The second they go for your zipper, all bets are off.  Oh, yeah.  As a guy, that is just...  You're giving away every bit of information.  I'll sign anything, whatever you need.  It's all yours.  He endured three days of torture, just like...  And you hear the story, it's like, then I hear the footsteps coming again, and no,  I was in for another three-hour beating.  And you know what it means?  What?  A three-hour beating? 
[00:34:00]  Even if you didn't know, that would be the worst.  If you didn't even know what they were talking about, you couldn't even give them an answer.  You could just come up with stuff that would be so believable, I would think, under that  kind of pressure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your fingernails and all that.  You'd have to.  I watch a lot of these things on the History Channel, and you see Vietnam POWs, and they  talk about how they were just locked in these rooms, and people wouldn't even ask them anything.  They would just come in and beat them senseless and leave. 
[00:34:30]  And then you're just sitting there in pain, bleeding, broken bones, going, what was that  about?  Like, at least ask me something.  And then they'd make sounds.  Like, one guy said, they'd kick your door open, and that's how you'd know the beating  was coming.  And some days they would just kick your door open, and then close it, and walk away.  And like that's, like, just mentally F you. 
[00:35:00]  And then they'd start, you know, after a few weeks of that, maybe asking you a few questions,  and maybe you're loosened up a little, like, anything you want to know.  It's just sitting there going, guys, this really isn't unnecessary.  Get about as loose as it's going to get the second you caught me.  Day one.  When I was on the truck, you could have asked me.  Yeah.  I would have joined the Viet Cong.  Give me one of those big rice-picking hats.  Give me a black robe and a pointy hat.  Yeah.  I'll throw a grenade in a helicopter.  Whatever you need.  Let's go to George in Colorado.  George.  Hey, morning, boys. 
[00:35:30]  Good morning, George.  Hey, back in the late 80s, I worked at the security guard in a bank.  And one afternoon, I was in back having a cup of coffee.  The teller alarm light lit up.  I walked out, peeked around the corner, and there was a guy standing there with a new  hand in a note to a teller for a robbery.  I came around the back way, and our armored truck was there, and the guy came walking in  at the same time.  We waited for the guy to walk out, and we pulled our guns on him, and then I pulled him  at gunpoint. 
[00:36:00]  When the cops arrived, the guy looked at the cops and said, I didn't mean it.  Can I go home now?  I don't want to go to jail.  I didn't mean to rob a bank.  Yeah.  There you go.  I don't know what happened.  You've got to think everyone tries that.  Yeah, you've got 15 years for it.  Right.  15 years.  You can go home in 15 years.  15 years.  That's great.  Let's go to the Bronx.  Lisa, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good this morning.  Oh, good.  Not for nothing, but people that get tased, they don't say, ow, that really, really hurt. 
[00:36:30]  Ow, that really, really hurt.  That really, really hurt.  That reporter that got shot with the BB gun.  Oh, yeah.  That was the BB gun online.  What a non-story.  That was pretty funny.  Shooting on a line for a video game.  We'll tell you about it.  Do we have that?  Drive-by shooting.  Oh, whoa.  Sounds violent.  A BB gun?  A BB gun.  And they have actual audio of the reporter, who was one of the victims, got shot.  She's online interviewing the people, waiting for the PS3, and all of a sudden, she gets 
[00:37:00]  hit in the back of the leg with a BB.  And the anchor has to ask her, first, we have to know, are you okay?  Did it break the skin?  But right in the middle of the interview, you hear her go, ow, that really hurt.  Yeah, they're talking, and she goes, ow, that really, really hurt.  Which one is it?  Oh, shocking.  Gunshot wound.  Is it track two?  Ow, that really, the way she says it, too, is like, if her boyfriend gave her ass a little  pinch when she was walking down the hall, and she just went, ow, that really, really hurt.  Oh, stop it.  Same tone, everything. 
[00:37:30]  I'm not sure if this is the track one.  Oh, I hope it is.  Well, we got it here somewhere.  We just got to figure out which one it is.  More than two dozen people are camping out, waiting for their PlayStation 3s.  Many are shocked and angered by the drive-by shooting.  We're actually going to come out here and sit and wait for a system I didn't even expect  to get shot at.  Got to get us.  While we were talking to Brett Combs, both of us were hit, shot by BBs aimed at the crowd.  Oh, that really, really hurt.  I think I got a shot with a BB gun.  Police cruisers will be here until 8 o'clock Friday morning. 
[00:38:00]  That was pretty much it.  That was it.  Ow, that really, really hurt.  Was that a fake siren sound effect in the background?  Yeah, thrown in the background to make it sound.  Probably.  The shooting.  Yeah.  Jimmy had a great line yesterday after that.  He goes, she said it like it was her feelings.  Like someone said something to her.  Ow, that really, really hurt.  Well, why don't you call Jim in jail and tell him it was a good line?  Yeah.  You would think a man of his means would be out by now. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  That was easy this time.  It's still early.  He only got picked up at like 2, 3 in the morning.  They like holding you.  It's only four hours ago.  I don't really know how that whole thing works.  Thank God for you.  All right.  It would take one more phone call and then we'll break.  We got to talk about OJ today.  We got to talk about this Disney on ice accident.  Aw.  Any accident that has something to do with Disney makes us laugh really hard.  I'm sorry.  Because they know how to handle it.  Uh, also, man, uh, no, where's the one I want to talk about? 
[00:39:00]  Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.  Man argues sex with dead deer is not a crime.  It's definitely not raped.  No.  Let's say hi to Ellis in Philly.  What's up, Ellis?  Hey, guys.  You got to play the audio of the cops laughing at that lady that got shot in the head with  the rubber bullet.  Yeah, that was a good one.  They got a little chuckle.  Chuckle at roll call.  All right.  Ellis.  Speck and Z-Tack.  And I don't ask for requests often, but can you do a taser guy again, Toe, as we go to 
[00:39:30]  break?  One more time.  Look, man, this is a public place.  I'm a taxpayer.  You're, you're, you're the authority figures that are going to tell me when I can come and  go and leave.  I'm staying here because I have the right to, ah, I'll go.  I'm leaving.  Please don't leave.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:40:00]  Taser videos are sweeping America, by the way.  They are the best.  I can't get enough of them.  Oh, that one.  You just become a goldfish out of the bowl.  That guy is-  Put it on the floor.  That guy was a bad boy because they kept the trigger down for a while.  He's trying to talk. 
[00:40:30]  He shot him in his tongue.  Yeah, you could just be like, hello, how are you doing today?  Yes, I'm fine.  It's a wonderful afternoon.  I got...  Greatest invention of the 20th century. 
[00:41:00]  That sounded like a gut shot.  I defy you to not make a sound.  To silently be tasered.  Oh, that's a great contest.  I was going to say, if the lawyers let us do it, that would be the greatest bit ever.  Whoever makes the smallest noise, they'd be trying.  How great would that be?  Screwed like a deal or no deal and all those shows. 
[00:41:30]  Get a show on TV.  It's a simple game.  $2 million up for grabs if you could take a taser without making a sound.  Without making a peep.  No sound.  Night after night, they just have people lining up to try to win the money.  You know one guy would get close with like a...  He almost does it.  Or kind of like reverse name that tune.  You remember how you'd go down like I can name that in two notes.  Yeah, yeah.  One note.  You could just slowly increase the voltage.  Like I cannot make a noise in with 40 volts. 
[00:42:00]  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, our first contestant, here is Bob.  No, no, no!  This is Ken.  Okay.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  All right.  Next contestant.  Okay, okay, okay, okay.  That guy's like...  See?  Okay, okay.  Okay, okay, okay. 
[00:42:30]  Complete agreement.  They turn into Jerry Lewis.  Who would not watch the taser show?  Night after night.  Night after night.  American taser.  That guy got to the point.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah.  That didn't stop.  He obviously was a bad boy.  That must just seem like an eternity also.  Like, ah, shouldn't this be stopping? 
[00:43:00]  What's your mind saying?  Yeah, your mind is like, this is a long time.  I've seen taser videos, and this is going for quite a while.  I can clearly see I'm not a threat at this point.  See, that's what you think you're saying, but you're really saying...  Yeah, your head is like, excuse me, officer, I'm complying.  I'm laying here now.  It's been quite a while that you've been tasing me.  I'm completely cooperative.  That's in your brain, right?  I'm telling you now.  I'm laying here still, waiting to be handcuffed and taken away.  Actual translation.  Back into the book!  Ah, guys! 
[00:43:30]  Shit, I got that.  I'm in the back.  Okay, okay.  It probably jars stuff.  Like, as you're yelling, you're also doing a book report you did in fifth grade.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just connecting synapses in your head and make no sense.  Ah, you need custard.  You need that glass slice.  Yeah, mommy, help me tie my shoes.  I got to fill out a job application.  Oh, man.  We're trying to take a break, but someone's requesting the girl singing.  I don't have it in front of me. 
[00:44:00]  The girl singing?  Ah, Sweet Home Alabama.  Oh, yeah, some girl was singing.  We can go to break with this.  We got Bill Burr in studio.  Bill, are we promoting anything today?  Yeah, I'm at the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow.  Awesome.  New Brunswick.  New Brunswick.  That's Vinny's Club.  It's a great place.  Vinny Brand.  Yes.  You know, E-Rock, if it was in front of me, I would have found it.  We need a taser for E-Rock.  All right, we'll play when we get back, I guess.  A guy wants to shoot his taser off. 
[00:44:30]  All right, we got lots to do.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. & Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall, maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. & Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy. 
[00:45:00]  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. & Anthony Show.  Right.  It's the O.P. & Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. & Anthony Show on XM202.  O.P. & Anthony.  We're back with the O.P. & Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Bill Burr is in this morning.  Let's say hi to Matt in Pennsylvania. 
[00:45:30]  Matt, what's up?  Yo, guys.  I just turned on my XM 10 minutes ago.  Yeah.  Did you guys just say that Jim was slow in a tranny and wound up in a slammer last night?  That's a legend.  Yeah, you got to keep it clean for the radio.  But, yes, the rumor about Jim is true.  Bill Burr in today.  We're looking at tornado coverage on TV.  It's one of the big things.  One of the things people are talking about today.  And we're discussing how the tornadoes, it's nothing personal.  It's just very random. 
[00:46:00]  Very random.  But sometimes it seems personal.  Right, right, right.  Sometimes it seems personal because they just showed an aerial shot of a neighborhood and a few houses had been picked up and dropped in the middle of the street, completely destroyed, flattened.  Then you look across the street and there's a house there and it's fine.  There's a house you'd make an offer on.  Yeah, not a mark on it, nothing.  Just nothing.  Probably a whole bunch of people lining up to make an offer on the house.  Excuse me.  It's just so like.  Are you selling? 
[00:46:30]  It's so random, just like you, you, and you.  You.  You don't have houses anymore.  But your neighbor right next door, I'll leave that one alone.  The price of his house actually increases because now it's a secluded area.  It keeps going up.  Yeah.  Nearest neighbor for miles.  He went from having a quarter acre to 20 acres.  And they always talk about that, you know, to the people that lost the house.  We had everything in there and I'll tell you, at least we got our lives. 
[00:47:00]  We can rebuild.  We can rebuild.  I accept this test from the Lord.  Yeah.  No, we're staying.  We're staying.  They don't talk to the guy like, you know, hello.  He's got a door.  You can knock on it.  Right.  And he comes.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  The tornado last night.  I see your house is in perfect shape.  Yeah.  Can you believe that?  The neighbors are just like scowling at him.  Like, what did I do?  I saw him at church.  I went every day, too. 
[00:47:30]  Why would the Lord pick me?  We're at church all the time.  I guess he only picks the strong ones.  Strong.  Right.  The Lord would never give me anything more than I could handle.  If I was the lucky one where my whole neighborhood was gone except for my house, I'd be the arrogant  guy on my front lawn just watering the grass, whistling a tune.  Like as.  While people are picking apart their houses.  The ambulances are still pulling through.  Right.  And you're just.  Right.  Water in the lawn.  Hey, Mike, did you get your sink off my lawn?  Yeah.  Ah, yes. 
[00:48:00]  Ah.  Just another day in the suburbs.  Just walk out.  Give that big stretch.  Get the morning paper.  This is great.  All hell's going on around you.  You're just watering your grass.  People standing with blankets.  Right.  Picking through their stuff, trying to find their wedding photos.  And you're like.  And you're just like.  And you act all disgusted that there's like a piece of a shingle sitting on your lawn.  Whose shingle is this?  Excuse me.  And you know what?  That's the time when you wanted to have been the antisocial like neighbor who never showed 
[00:48:30]  up for anything.  Right.  That way no one will come up to your house.  Yeah.  Can we stay here?  I know you got some double wide.  We need the room.  Yeah, do you?  Be the lordy kind of thing to do.  I think there's a shelter at the high school if that wasn't destroyed.  Try that.  That's when you know seriously like your life is a wreck when you got to start saying that  a higher power.  That's always the higher power.  Decided to test you. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  It's just a test from the Lord.  But you know, thank the Lord that my family made it through.  You know, we don't have anything left.  As you can see here, this cement slab is where the house used to be.  And then the husband's got to come up and comfort her.  It's all right, baby.  We'll rebuild.  We're going to rebuild.  Right.  Then he ends up losing it.  Yeah.  I just bought a new bass boat and it was right over there.  Yeah.  You see the bass boats right there in that tree?  You know, right in the tree.  I mean, we always have to discuss the one thing that is left. 
[00:49:30]  As you can see, the only thing I got is a bathtub.  It's always like a chimney.  It's half a chimney.  Half a chimney and a bathtub.  And that's where we're going to start rebuilding.  Right there with the bathtub.  It's amazing.  The one thing that was saved is the thing we need to never use.  The bathtub.  Unless we were throwing a kegger.  Actually, she was hiding in the fireplace and I was hiding in the tub.  Looks like we picked the right thing. 
[00:50:00]  The Lord just knew where we should go.  But we're going to rebuild.  No, no, no.  We're moving.  We're moving.  We're moving.  Why did you tase me?  I lost everything.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  That's a big reason why I moved to Dallas.  I was living in Oklahoma City in 99 when that F5 tornado hit.  Yeah.  And we dived down into the damn shelter and we're all down there. 
[00:50:30]  You can hear it just going over top like a freight train.  Did it sound like a freight train, sir?  Yeah, yeah.  If I got to hear that analogy one more time.  How come when a freight train goes by, you never go, that just sounds like a tornado?  It's an awful analogy that has been used for too long.  But anyhow, we come out.  I thought maybe we were going to have to grab the guns because I figured, oh man, people  are going to start loose.  And about our house and four other houses were still standing. 
[00:51:00]  And across the street, the tallest part of their house was knee high.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  People were just looking at us like, we want to kill you because your house is still up.  Did they ask to stay with you?  Close enough, please.  Yeah, you should.  I guess they, yeah, you're probably not the hit of the neighborhood if your house is left  alone.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Anyway, it's taser day on the Opie and Anthony show.  I guess that bit's over.  Oh, well.  Rebuilt.  We don't know how to show concern. 
[00:51:30]  So we just tell you the news, goof on it and move on.  Have no compassion.  We really stink.  We get scared when we have to show our emotions.  Oh, those poor people.  Here we go.  Here's the taser of audio of the girl singing Sweet Home Alabama.  Sweet Home Alabama.  Where should you face it?  Face it.  Face it.  When it's found off the blue.  What are you doing?  You're a f***er.  New bit.  Why did they tase her?  I got another bit.  What?  Well, we want the game show to see if someone could take a taser and not say anything. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  How about taser karaoke?  Hmm.  We'll do it at FH Riley's in a couple weeks.  Ah.  What are the rules?  There are no rules.  You just start your stupid song and then we decide when to tase you.  Are you allowed to do tasing bits these days?  I don't know.  I have no idea what the law is on tasing people if they fill out a consent form. 
[00:52:30]  Question for Eric Logan.  Yeah.  At XM Satellite Radio.  And what I learned.  We want to do taser karaoke.  What I learned is the taser, actually the hooks go in, there's hooks that go into you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Barbs.  It goes right into you.  It shoots out.  That's why you hear like that pop beforehand.  Because it's actually a gunpowder charge.  Shoots it out or compressed air.  Shoots it out.  The wires, you know.  Vroom.  Vroom.  I was going to say, that was great.  They go.  Vroom.  And the barbs go into you. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  And that way, because they would come out if you're rolling around.  All right.  I got a question for the expert.  That way, you can hit him once, twice, three times.  Can you be killed by a taser?  If you have a bad heart, maybe.  Some people can.  All right.  So we'll get a medical team.  If the person's young enough.  Dude.  Like a four-year-old.  Don't throw water on him.  Dude.  A four-year-old.  I'm telling you right now.  Taser karaoke.  Get it done.  I want some stats.  Get it done.  Youngest person ever taser.  You're going to have to hold it. 
[00:53:30]  Huh?  You don't have to shoot him.  If you take it out of the taser itself, they can hold on to the ends.  Without them getting actually attached to them.  And they still get.  Well, what's the one where you push it against their skin?  It's a stun gun.  A stun gun.  Can we do stun gun karaoke?  That's how we would do it.  All right.  Let's do stun gun.  Stun gun's more manly.  Yeah, let's do stun guns.  Stun guns are more accessible.  Anybody can shoot somebody.  But listen, you got to get up there and look them in their eyes.  All right.  One for the lawyers.  Here we go.  We got to find out if we can do stun gun karaoke. 
[00:54:00]  And we got two companies.  So I don't give a crap where we do it.  This is it.  You got two people.  They're both singing the same song, maybe.  Somehow there's got to be one person sucks more than the other.  And if you suck more than the other guy, you get tased.  Yeah.  There's got to be some kind of thing where not everyone gets tased.  This is great.  The listeners can hear our tremendous think tank.  Yeah.  This is how it's going to work.  We're brainstorming.  Okay.  I stun gunned.  You get a taser.  I stun gunned an old girlfriend once. 
[00:54:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I used to build little electronic things and I went to Radio Shack and in this electronics  book, I found how to make a stun gun.  And so I got all the parts and soldering iron and solder and schematics and the PC board  and soldered it all together.  Meanwhile, you're probably flunking all your classes at this point.  I'd already dropped out of high school.  So I was just hanging around unemployed, drinking beer, seeing if I could make a stun gun. 
[00:55:00]  So I think you were going to read that book.  Yeah, I know.  You're crazy.  Enough about the book.  I soldered the thing together.  But the thing is now I didn't have enough capacitors in there to really make it arc between the  two electrodes.  I'm just going to agree at this point.  But I put it on a voltage tester and it showed up like it was pumping out some volts.  You ever see somebody hit a stun gun and you see the arcing sparks between the two contacts? 
[00:55:30]  It didn't do that.  But I tested it and it was kicking ass.  So I didn't think it would work though.  I was so unsure that I could not possibly build something that worked.  You didn't believe in yourself.  I didn't believe in myself.  So I touched my girlfriend's leg.  She was sitting on the couch with the contacts.  And pressed the button real quick.  And oh, it worked.  She screamed and started crying.  I felt so bad. 
[00:56:00]  I'm just like, oh baby, I'm sorry.  Oh no, I'm so sorry.  I didn't mean to taser you.  That is the worst.  It really was bad.  When women cry, it's over.  I felt so bad.  Yeah.  Hey.  Couldn't try it on myself.  Let's go to Tom in New York City.  Why would I have?  Yeah.  Tom.  Yo, what's up, boy?  Hey.  Yo, Rodney King, if you watch that tape or read anything about it, he was tased three  times and tore him out.  Yep.  We were just talking about that. 
[00:56:30]  That's what he likes out of him.  But he was a bad monkey.  So what are you going to do?  Oh, well, there you go.  You had to go there.  But yeah, the expert in the studio said that they were using the taser on Rodney King and  he was just ripping it out of his chest.  Yeah.  A lot of people will do the tasing game, Anthony.  So we got people.  How do you get people that will?  Believe me, I'm glad, but.  We got people.  We got bit.  We just need to see if we can get it done over here or XM.  All right. 
[00:57:00]  Bill's horrified.  That's a good one.  It sounded like a rooster.  Bill's horrified.  That was a woman that wouldn't get out of the car?  Yeah.  Is that her?  Yeah.  She was on the cell phone.  There was a woman on the cell phone and she's talking to a friend going, yeah, well, I just  got pulled over and the police want me to get out of the car.  I'm on the phone.  Put down the phone.  Get out of the car. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  They want me to get out of the car.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm out of the car.  I'm out of the car.  Wow.  Change my calling plan.  I'm really sick.  We need the follow up clip because then she's like, okay, okay.  Yeah.  And she starts crying.  Hey, we got a brand new.  I love it.  We got a brand new clip.  What's this one?  I don't know.  Where's Danny? 
[00:58:00]  New taser?  Yeah.  New taser.  It's long too.  I don't know what the story is.  Oh, good.  Here comes Danny.  What's up, Danny?  The longer the better.  It's not necessarily a new one.  It's just a real good one that hasn't been out in a while.  What's the, do we need to set it up?  Classic.  A classic.  Classic.  No, there's plenty of, you hear the cops yelling at her now.  The guy from REO Speedwagon getting tased.  All right.  Open the door.  Open the door.  You're going to get tased.  Okay?  Open the door.  All I got to say is.  Open the door. 
[00:58:30]  I'm not drunk.  Open the door.  Open that door right there.  You're going to get tased.  Do you hear me?  That's fine.  So get out.  Okay?  Go ahead and get out that door.  Thank you.  No problem.  You don't have to test me.  Yes, I do.  Step out of the car, ma'am.  No, you don't.  I'm getting out of the car voluntarily.  Get out of the car.  Step out now.  Okay, so you can get off of me.  Get out of the car.  Step out.  You can get off of me.  I'm getting out voluntarily.  Step out.  I'm getting out voluntarily.  You can get off.  Ma'am, right now you're under arrest.  Okay, get off of me. 
[00:59:00]  You're under arrest.  That's fine.  Get off of me.  I'm getting out voluntarily.  Are you going to step out?  I'm getting out of my car.  She's getting out of my car.  Put your hands behind your back.  Look, how am I going to stay?  Put your hands behind your back.  I'm not.  I'm not.  There's your fit.  Put your hands behind your back.  Now, put your hands behind your back.  I can't wait.  I'm going to see. 
[00:59:30]  Watch.  I'm going to see you.  What?  I'm going to see you.  Stay right there.  Stay right there.  3425.  I need a supervisor for 30.  Move, bitch.  What's your thing?  I'm going to go.  Man, I know.  I hate you.  That's your bit, man.  That is a great one.  All I have to say is.  All I have to say is.  Why?  People get so belligerent, too.  And they're like, step out of the vehicle. 
[01:00:00]  Get out of the car.  Get out of the car.  Get out of the car.  She, at this point, is pretty much under arrest.  When she's stepping out, you can tell the cops are probably taking her to put her against the car and frisk her.  And she's, don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  That's now she's resisting.  And they've got to use a little more pressure on her.  She thinks they should just.  In her head.  She stepped out of the car.  She finally complied.  She should just be left alone.  Untouched. 
[01:00:30]  Nothing.  No.  You're going to be frisked.  And if you're drunk, you're going to be arrested.  And if you're like she got, you're going to get tased.  Yeah.  What point do you guys.  Is there like a head nod where everybody knows to let go?  It's like, here we go.  Well, the one partner was pulling her out through the driver's side.  And the guy who shot her with the taser was on the passenger side.  He shot her right through the car.  She was kind of like standing up.  Trick shot.  Behind the back with a mirror.  The one guy was trying to put up.  Willie Moscone.  Spun it and put it in his holster. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  That was a good one.  Let's say hi to Nick in New York.  Nick, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I'll get tased.  I don't care.  All right.  So you'll do taser karaoke?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  All right.  We've got to figure out how we're going to do that.  Cool.  Hold on the line.  We'll get your info.  Can I please be here on that day?  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Amy in Astoria.  Amy.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Amy.  The rules for the karaoke should be like the gong show kind of. 
[01:01:30]  They're like, you just taste them if they're doing too bad.  You kill them.  I'm a fucking karaoke star.  And a potty mouth to boot.  She's an effing karaoke star.  That might not be a bad idea.  But what's up with radio in New York City, guys?  You're all into radio, right?  Well, there's different frequencies, and they're sent to...  Oh, I thought she wanted to...  Well, what, Amy?  Do you think people are less punk rock in New York now because they're worried about 
[01:02:00]  being tased?  That's an excellent question.  What?  All right, Amy.  What are you trying to say?  The TV is moving to Las Vegas, and there's nothing punk rock for anyone to do.  So there's no...  You know, you guys are punk rock.  The way you just described that thing about her...  About you touching your girlfriend's leg and that whole electrocution scene, that was  an ACDC song right there. 
[01:02:30]  You should just rewind it, and that's a song right there.  Oh, wow.  We haven't had one of these in a while.  Billy, I love how Billy just started cracking up out of nowhere.  No, you know what's funny?  I can't...  She's not...  Or...  She's just...  She's on...  She's connecting stuff on some genius level that we don't understand.  That we can't understand.  Amy, do you drink or do any drugs?  Yeah, I'm a bartender.  I just got off my shift.  I just got the last person out like 10 minutes ago.  Oh, so you usually do some shots at some of the guys? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, you know.  Yeah.  What's your poison?  Jägermeister?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Always.  I could tell that's...  Screaming Nazis.  You sound like a...  Oh, screaming Nazis.  Screaming Nazis, man.  Nice.  You sound like a Jägermeister buzz.  Yeah, well, I'm trying to get off the tequila.  I'm changing.  Yeah, and I was gonna...  That was my next choice.  Jäger years.  Oh.  I know this chick.  I'm changing to the Jäger years.  You should.  You were married to her for 10 years.  Sorry, and I couldn't resist. 
[01:03:30]  You're sorry.  Why is it rock and roll suicide in New York City?  Is it a test market for Sirius and XM?  Is that what it is?  I don't know, man.  Is it a test market for...  Come on.  What was your point, Amy?  It says you don't like New York radio or something like that.  My point is why does New York radio suck except for talk radio?  Why is there no rock and roll anymore?  Why is there no punk rock?  Are people scared of being...  Because of the iPods, man. 
[01:04:00]  I went to the Primus show at Roseland.  Primus sucks.  They stopped.  Yeah, Primus sucks, but they suck for real, like, from that show.  Oh, really, man?  Yeah.  Wow, what happened?  Like, they oversold the show.  People were all crowded up, and I don't know if they do that to, like...  The almighty dollar, man.  You know, they've sacrificed their art for the dollar, man.  If they present, you know, if they do have to prevent moshing, because everyone's too close 
[01:04:30]  to mosh or something.  I don't know if they do that.  But they broke the barricade down, and they stopped the show, like, three songs in, and  they stopped it, and it was so terrible, and everyone's just sitting there.  No one's saying nothing.  No one...  It was so...  What would have happened back in the day?  It was so un-New York that no one was, like, screaming anything, like, fucking bullshit.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, how old are you?  I'm 30.  Oh.  30?  All right.  Wow, you're talking like he was there when the sex pistols hit. 
[01:05:00]  Man, I remember 78.  Yeah, I do.  I do remember it, because I fucking looked at it.  All right, listen, listen.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Amy, Amy, you're a potty mouth.  You got your bar mouth on.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  All right, Amy, hold on a line.  We'll talk to you after the break some more, okay?  You've got a Jaeger vocabulary.  Do a shot or two, and get your thoughts together, and we'll talk to you in a few minutes.  I'm terrible.  All right, we've got to take a break.  I'm terrible.  I'm awful.  We still haven't heard from Jim Norton.  Bill Burr is in for Jim.  If he gets out, I can still hang, right? 
[01:05:30]  You can hang for the day.  All right.  You're allowed.  This is hilarious.  And after the break, we talk to Donald Trump.  What is he promoting?  What is he promoting today?  Everything.  First call arraignment at 8.  That's what he's promoting?  Oh, I thought that's what Donald Trump's promoting.  I got all confused.  Uh, the Learning Addicts Real Estate and Wealth Expo?  This is a big thing.  Oh, boy.  Oh, they talk about money and how to make it and how to become a millionaire. 
[01:06:00]  Stay tuned for some riveting radio with Donald Trump.  The O.P. and Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of The O.P. and Anthony Show are appearing in a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opiananthony.com.  It's The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good morning. 
[01:06:30]  It's The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Spreading across America.  Phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  Uh, it's Charles in New Jersey.  What's up, Charles?  Yeah, I woke up a little, uh, late and I heard there's some type of rumor about Jimmy.  What's going on?  Uh, Jimmy got arrested.  We'll have more in a little bit.  Gotta get the details.  But I gotta cut you short because we got Donald Trump on the phone.  Mr. Trump.  Good morning.  Welcome.  There's The Donald.  Welcome back to The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Very good.  How's the show doing?  I hear well. 
[01:07:00]  Uh, yeah, we're doing all right.  The word is well.  That's good.  You know, uh, we're like you, uh, Donald.  Uh, we have our ups and downs.  You never quit.  That's how it goes.  But, right, you never quit.  Never, ever give up.  Remember, I remember a few years back, everybody was, uh, talking about your demise.  They thought it was gone.  Remember, it was all over.  They thought maybe he was gone and they just can't stand the fact that it's bigger and better.  Yeah.  Uh, Mr. Trump, last time we talked, I, uh,  I told you about my woes about, uh, uh, buying a place in New York.  And I'm sure you don't remember that because as soon as you hang up with us, you forget you even talk to us. 
[01:07:30]  Because you have, uh, because you have much more important people.  A very busy man.  Yeah, a very busy man.  You want to hear what happened to me real fast?  Yes, I do.  Co-op board got me.  How stupid am I?  You mean they wouldn't let you in?  Mm-mm.  In other words, you made the deal and they, they, they embarrassed you, right?  Made the deal.  Yeah, see who knows.  Co-op board is one of the few remaining forms of discrimination.  You know that.  Yes, yes.  And you go before these people, they can do whatever they want.  I don't know if the law is on their side or not, but so many of my friends have been rejected from boards by boards. 
[01:08:00]  Your friends?  Yeah, what do your friends get with you as a reference?  Well, they go in, you know, they go in and they buy an apartment and they're all excited and their wife is jumping up and down or girlfriend or whoever it is.  And they're jumping up and down and then they go before a board and then they learn that they didn't qualify because something is wrong with them.  And it's pretty depressing.  So, now, were you depressed?  Well, let's, I paid 10%, more than 10% down, signed contracts.  All I had to do was wait to meet the board.  They said it was an easy board. 
[01:08:30]  All they care about is if you could afford the place, which I can.  And I never heard from them.  And next thing you know, an email.  Never even got to sit in front of them.  Wow.  Bunch of pussies.  They didn't even do it to my face.  You mean you never got to meet the board?  No.  Well, that's actually better than meeting the board, spending time with the board and getting rejected.  At least you can say to yourself they didn't know you.  Yeah.  Well, and then they said it was job related.  That we can understand. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  I think if I were on the board, I'd actually probably vote against you.  I think they finally Googled my name.  See, that's why you've got to be like Trump.  You've got to buy the whole building.  Yeah, exactly.  Then there's no co-op.  I'm my own board.  I'm throwing myself out.  Set up your own board and take the top floor.  That's what I do.  Donald, the rage, though.  I mean, the least they could have done was do it to my face and meet me.  But just hiding behind this board.  You don't know the members.  You don't know who's in charge.  Yeah.  How is that still legal, by the way?  Well, it's been legal. 
[01:09:30]  It's amazing.  As I said, it's probably the greatest form of discrimination.  I mean, people are getting rejected.  And sometimes for really wrong reasons.  I mean, in your case, it was for the right reason, okay?  You're a wild man.  They don't want to have a wild man.  How do you know I'm a wild man in my personal life?  Are you married?  Girlfriend.  Okay, good.  Well, you're probably a wild man, you know, and that's okay.  I'm not a wild man.  Maybe on the radio.  I might have said you should be in the building.  Maybe that's the kind of building I like.  But the people on board sometimes don't like guys.  Donald, I am the biggest bore when I'm not doing this radio show. 
[01:10:00]  And actually, I'm a bore when I do the radio show as well.  But, no, I mean, I go to bed early.  I'm out of the building by, what, 4.45 in the morning?  I'm a perfect person to have in your building.  Yeah, it sounds like it, actually.  Move to one of the many Trump buildings.  That's true.  I'll do that.  Any one of my buildings just pay me a lot of money.  Well, I tried to get a hold of Donald's people, and they pretty much just blew me off.  Yeah.  You know, the truth is you're better off being in a condominium as opposed to a co-op.  Because, in all fairness, even if you did get in, and let's say time's got a little bad, 
[01:10:30]  and let's say you needed money, which does happen on occasion, you want to sell your apartment,  and now you sell it to somebody that you think is good, and you're excited, you're going to get a check,  and you need it badly, and they go before the board, and they get rejected.  I know a guy who was having financial difficulty who sold his apartment nine times.  The first time he got a lot of money for it.  This was during sort of a bad period of time.  The first time he got a lot of money, the person got rejected. 
[01:11:00]  The second time he didn't get as much.  It kept going down because the market kept going down, right?  They accepted the ninth one.  He got one-third of the price that he got originally, and he said he'd never invest in any.  All because the board, yeah.  Whereas the condominium, that doesn't happen.  And a condominium is a better form of ownership.  Right.  And I would take his advice.  Wait, one more question before we move on.  Right, because then I'll be able to sleep at night.  Go ahead.  Oliver Cromwell. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  The Oliver Cromwell building.  Right.  Stuffy?  Snooty?  The name sounds stuffy.  I don't know the building.  Where is the building?  It's near the Dakota.  And is it a condo or a co-op?  No, that was the one I got rejected from, the co-op.  Doesn't sound too good to me.  That sounded stuffy.  Well, we'll continue to look at it.  The Oliver Cromwell building?  Oliver Cromwell.  I don't like the name.  It's nothing like a Trump building.  Trump.  You want Trump on the top of the building.  Trump.  Trump.  I think I'm...  You pay twice as much, and you can sell it for four times. 
[01:12:00]  And I can't picture going to the Cromwell Casino.  No, I don't know.  I don't like the Cromwell.  I don't know.  I don't like the name Oliver Cromwell.  The Cromwell.  Actually, I'm going to be checking out a few places in a few of your buildings, I think,  next week.  Where?  Which buildings?  Yeah.  Yeah, he doesn't want to say.  Near the park.  Okay.  Well, you let me know, and if I can help you, I will.  But I have great buildings.  Seriously.  That's what he said last time.  So we finished the show, and I'm like, well, time to call Donald back.  How do you call Donald back?  You don't.  I have a great building, which is absolutely the best location. 
[01:12:30]  59th and Park Avenue.  Oh, that's nice.  That's great.  What location are you looking for?  I heard that area's going down.  Yeah, right.  I think so.  That's true.  Actually, I think I might be looking at one in that building as well.  Yeah, that's a great building.  I'm all over the place.  Great people living in that building, and the board, which is me, will not reject you.  Oh, oh, oh.  Look at that.  Wouldn't that be fun?  You could sit in front of the big table, and he goes, you're rejected.  I could do that, actually, if I wanted, but I tend not to. 
[01:13:00]  He has his assistant do it.  Yeah.  Jimmy lives in the same building as your son.  Oh, really?  Oh, that's good.  On the west side.  He is very, very happy with that building.  That's a great building.  Great views, great everything.  I've looked in there as well.  You know, the fact is, I build great buildings.  What I do best is I build.  You know, I speak about this on occasion.  I mean, you know, people show up for the Learning Annex and by the thousands.  But what I really do best is I'm a builder.  That's when I see you strap on the tool belt and get the hammer and the sawzall, and I see you up there building. 
[01:13:30]  I like building things, and that's what I like doing best, but that's also what I do best.  And when you say that you're in one of my buildings on the west side, I mean, they're really well-built buildings.  They're great buildings, and they've been very successful, and everyone loves them.  They absolutely don't.  Is it true you're going to be a grandfather?  Yeah, it's a little bit.  It's both very happy, but the concept of being called Grandpa doesn't play for me somehow.  Yeah, it's got to be one of those milestones, one of those landmarks that you don't really. 
[01:14:00]  That's like, you know, turning a certain age or when I'm called Grandpa.  But I'm happy because, you know, Don's a great guy, and he's got a wonderful wife, and I'm sure it'll be a wonderful grandchild.  But, you know, I just don't want him to call me Grandpa.  And I bet you still haven't changed a diaper.  I have not.  I love that about you.  In fact, the baby is in the next room.  Melania is right now changing a diaper probably 40 feet away from me, and no, I have not changed a diaper yet. 
[01:14:30]  And not because I wouldn't.  She really doesn't want me to.  She wants to do it.  She wants to make sure everything's good.  But, Donald, you're a builder.  I'm a builder.  Yeah, you don't change.  What's this?  Builds buildings.  I don't change diapers.  I build.  That's right.  Donald, what's the scenario where you would actually change a diaper?  What would have to happen to you?  If gold came out of the baby, he could change diapers.  Let's see.  What would be the scenario?  I guess the baby is screaming like crazily for days.  For days, see?  A big buildup.  Yeah.  For days, and Melania was someplace where I couldn't find her for weeks. 
[01:15:00]  See, that's what we love about Donald Trump.  He's just a very honest guy.  He's not going to sugarcoat it.  That's what it is.  He can't be bothered with that stuff.  He's not going to change diapers.  I would actually do it, but, you know, honestly, she is the type that, you know, I have a lot  of friends.  They're big people.  They change diapers.  I'm married to a woman.  You can laugh at her.  She doesn't want me to do that.  I mean, she doesn't feel it's my deal, and I appreciate that.  She happens to be right, by the way.  But she understands that that's what she wants to do, and that's what she does. 
[01:15:30]  Do you ever shove it in her face, like, look, I'll change the diaper, and you make this  big deal that I'm doing right now?  Well, she could probably do it.  Hey, she might do better than I do.  Who knows?  That would be a nice change.  Yeah, right on.  Now, you're telling people how to become millionaires?  Is that what you're doing?  Well, I'm speaking at the Learning Annex, which is an amazing institution, on Sunday,  and I speak at about 6 o'clock on Sunday night, and we have literally tens of thousands 
[01:16:00]  of people going to be there.  It's going to be an amazing evening.  Yeah, this sounds pretty good, because a lot of times, these things cost a lot of  money to get into, to get that kind of expert information.  Well, we really, we do a lot of good things at the Learning Annex, and we have a lot of  other speakers, but I'm the big guy in terms of the crowds and everything else, and we have  an amazing period of time.  It goes on about 6 o'clock on Sunday, and it is an amazing thing that takes place.  And, you know, from your show's standpoint, I will tell you, lots of guys and girls go 
[01:16:30]  to meet people.  It becomes like a mixer.  Yeah.  You see it all the time, where they walk out with a guy, you know, and they walk out with  people that want to be successful, so that's not so bad, right?  Because that's why they're there, yeah.  They're all there to be successful.  Are you saying that people are also going for chicks?  Yes.  And what's going on down there, Donald?  And girls are going gold diggers.  It's like Federline, this Federline who married Britney Spears before he asked me, and I was  knocking the hell out of him, and then I read someplace that his all-time hero is Donald 
[01:17:00]  Trump.  And the next time I was asked about Kevin Federline, I said, he's a fantastic guy.  Wonderful.  He made a great investment.  I don't know why he married her.  It was a terrible decision on his behalf.  He could have done much better.  So it's one of those things.  I think he did all right.  When people like you, you tend to like them, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  So what's the big plug here for the Learning Annex?  Well, the big plug is that you're going to go, you're going to learn, you're going to  have a lot of fun, and you really are.  I mean, people...  I thought it got canceled. 
[01:17:30]  What got canceled?  The Learning Annex.  Well, do me a favor.  Let me know.  I'm in Florida.  I won't come back.  Bill.  No, we're thinking.  I guess they're going to have over 50,000 people.  It's going to be phenomenal.  So I think it's going to really be an amazing evening.  I hope it is.  The Javits Center.  If it's not an amazing evening, I'm sure you're going to hear about it, okay?  Very good.  Now, if you go, you might even learn how to buy an apartment.  Yeah.  See?  That would be nice.  Maybe I should do that.  You should go.  And then I'll try to walk up and say hi to Donald Trump personally, and then I'll be probably 
[01:18:00]  tased, escorted from...  Well, if you go, you'll go.  If you go, you'll go is my guest.  All right.  I'll tell you about no co-ops, only condominiums.  And other than that, fellas, you have a great show.  All right, Donald.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, Donald.  Thank you very much.  Have a good time.  All right.  It's Donald Trump, everyone.  I bought a co-op last year.  Let's say hi to Keith the Cop.  Keith the Cop.  Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm out here hunting for our homeless contestants.  Yeah.  For the homeless shopping spree.  Yeah.  And, well, as usual, the reliability factor is very low. 
[01:18:30]  Mm-hmm.  But we have one gentleman that we're bringing up.  I just need...  Can somebody maybe check with the building and see if he can bring his dog up?  His dog?  Yeah.  Keith.  Keith, get him dark sunglasses and a cane and just say he's blind.  Hold on.  Is it the Jewish homeless guy?  What was that?  Is it the Jewish homeless guy that berates everyone on the sidewalk?  Do you see Sammy Davis, I don't think. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, all right.  That's very funny.  Very funny.  Yeah.  All right, Keith.  Yeah.  Well, bring him up.  Yeah, we're starting to interview people for the homeless shopping spree.  All right.  We'll be there in a couple minutes.  All right.  And we also have a guy here that's going to try out for the eggnog drinking contest.  Remember the guy earlier this week?  Yeah, he's going to try to drink a gallon of milk.  What happened?  He forgot his ID.  He's out?  Are you kidding me?  How do you forget your ID? 
[01:19:30]  How does anyone leave the house without their papers?  He's out.  He's the kind of guy who drinks a gallon of milk and then he cooks some eggnog.  Can I tell you something?  That really is – I think that might be my favorite bit that you guys do.  What?  When people forget their ID?  No, the – all right.  No, I'm saying that eggnog thing.  I don't think – I've never seen it.  Fantastic.  I just heard the audio of Pat from Unaki.  Please come in for it.  That's the funniest thing I've ever heard, though.  I personally invite you.  It's happening two weeks from today, the next eggnog drinking contest. 
[01:20:00]  Two weeks from today.  Last year I was on the road.  Are you going to be around in two weeks?  Probably not.  I think I'm out in Ontario, California.  Bill Burr's going to be at the Stress Factory tonight in New Brunswick.  A great club, Vinny's Club.  So here's a little taste of what happened during the last eggnog challenge. 
[01:20:30]  Sounds like you're backwashing a pool filter.  Yeah.  How great is that?  Is that great?  It's the funniest thing.  Oh.  And the reality is that's what should happen to anybody just after a glass of that crap. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  It's horrible.  Eggnog.  How great is that?  It's so thick and viscous.  It really gets that good sound.  It's like a motorboat trying to start up.  Yeah, yeah.  So two weeks from today, it's eggnog drinking contest three.  Three?  We're up to number three already.  Featuring Pat from Winnocky.  Yeah, so close to winning last year. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, he won the first year, second place last year.  By seconds.  The craziest thing happened.  He set the eggnog drinking record for the Opie and Anthony show, but lost the contest.  Lost the contest, but set the record.  Drank more than the other guy did by one shot.  Right.  But lost because he puked first.  The rules are real simple.  It's a double shot of eggnog every minute.  Every minute.  So Pat went early with his last shot.  Drank it.  Got it down. 
[01:22:00]  The other guy is just kind of holding his shot.  He's waiting.  He's holding his hand, looking at the clock.  So Pat from Winnocky is in the lead, officially.  And then all of a sudden, he can't hold it in.  He pukes.  The guy never had to drink.  The other guy wins.  Because it's all about who pukes first.  Who pukes first.  No matter what the second is.  He was showboating.  So the strategy.  Showboating.  It's like when the guy picks up the ball, interception, and right before he gets to the goal line,  he sticks it out, and that Bibby comes up.  Someone goes, whack.  Showboating.  Bibby.  Sorry.  You know what happens in the locker room when something like that goes down? 
[01:22:30]  I think he gets yelled at.  I think that happens.  I don't know.  I've never been in there, but.  All right.  Hey, do we have the promo for the eggnog drinking contest done?  Two weeks from today.  Just mark your calendar, everybody.  Looking forward to it.  Tell your friends.  That's when you know the holiday season's here.  Yeah, it's great.  Because we just line up ten guys, and it's just a puke fest.  And puke and farts.  Always funny.  For some reason, that's great.  Always funny.  It's Taser Day on the Open Anthony Show.  We kind of just threw this together at the last second. 
[01:23:00]  I got audio of the youngest person ever to be tased.  Would you like to guess how old?  Audio?  How old?  Youngest person ever tased.  Twelve.  Twelve.  Wow.  That's pretty young.  I'm saying a hairless torso.  Boy, that's a rough one.  Youngest person to get tased.  I got the audio in front of me.  I'm going to go ridiculous and say seven years old.  We'll tell you the age next.  Oh, you radio-teasing bastard. 
[01:23:30]  I'm a whore!  That's right.  Listen longer.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Bill Burr for coming in on no notice whatsoever. 
[01:24:00]  I thought you guys were joking when you called me up.  I've got to remind people you're playing the Stress Factory all weekend long.  Yeah, Friday, Saturday, out in New Brunswick.  Something, something, something, something, something, something.  Ha, ha.  Here's the phone number.  I think we're going to go tonight, Bill.  Are you going to head out there?  I'm going to try, yeah.  Okay.  I haven't been to the Stress Factory in a long time.  Vinny runs a great club.  Bill Burr's a great comedian.  Tickets still available?  Uh, tickets are going fast.  They are going fast.  Bill Burr at the Stress Factory all weekend long. 
[01:24:30]  We've got the youngest person ever tased in just a couple minutes here.  But first, you know, it's all the rage.  The PS3 and the stories are now coming out.  We said it yesterday that it's just going to get ugly as soon as they open those doors.  Yeah, because the people standing online didn't look like they would be very civil to each other.  There were a lot of people.  I was listening to the news on the way in,  and they were interviewing people online,  and most of the people, they asked,  why do you want to have this thing?  You know, what's the big deal about getting it?  And a lot of them said, 
[01:25:00]  I don't want it to play games on because I'm just going to resell it.  Because it's like that.  They're going to buy it and then resell it on eBay.  You know how crazy it got?  Because that's, you know, someone got even smarter than that, by the way,  because most people that were interviewed, like Ant said,  they said, yeah, I'm getting this thing, throwing it on eBay.  I'm going to get $2,000 or $3,000.  Now, you've got to think, look at eBay and watch the prices drop in the next,  literally the next hour, few hours.  Because there's going to be so many up there.  Kids went a step further. 
[01:25:30]  They were selling their place online on eBay.  That's ridiculous.  For $1,500.  Actually, I think it was $1,300.  How much was the system?  Huh?  Like $500?  $500, $600?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just wait a week?  Wait.  Because they only, you know what they did?  They put out 400,000 of these things for the whole United States.  Just 400,000 for the entire country.  And that was to create a hype.  Yeah.  That's what you were talking about.  Artificial, making it rare artificially.  And then these things will be coming over by the shiploads from Japan. 
[01:26:00]  And just be like ship after ship, a conga line, dumping them off.  There's a bigger fleet than when they came to bomb Pearl Harbor.  They're sitting off the coast.  Yeah.  Dropping them with zeros into stores.  It really is brilliant if you think about it.  Because, I mean, every news program has something on the PS3.  They're promoting the PS3.  We're talking about it right here, matter of fact.  It's promoting the PS3.  And then what do you think?  They're going to sit there and go, no, I have enough.  I could not make enough for American. 
[01:26:30]  No, they've got shiploads waiting offshore.  They're sitting right over the horizon.  If you're in California, look.  See?  They're out there.  They're right there.  That's not an oil rigger.  No.  It's a ship and it's full of PS3.  The invasion.  We found Andrew?  Nice.  I earned that cake.  Is he going to be joining us for the homeless shopping spree? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, I told him.  Hold on.  I don't know what Mike.  Yes, Stanley.  Why would your mic work?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I gave him some t-shirts and told him that we were going to give him more stuff.  Did he have anything to say about the cake?  No.  He didn't say anything at all.  Yeah.  I just made sure he was going to stay there and be there for later.  We haven't talked to him since the cake stomping, has he?  No.  Have you seen that video on YouTube yet?  So are we going to see him on the walkover, you mean?  Yes.  Oh, good.  Oh, we'll see him today.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, it's on YouTube.  Go to Opie and Anthony in the search and find the cake stomping. 
[01:27:30]  It's a classic video.  Poor bastard.  And we haven't talked to him since, so we'll talk to him today.  Had to walk away from the situation.  Right.  Had to walk away.  It was just awful.  Wait a minute.  Speaking of homeless people.  On his cake.  Yeah.  Keith, the cop, what's up?  Sorry, Ann.  I interrupted you there.  Sorry, Ann.  I was going to be in turn to watch the dog because the guy just pissed in the garbage can  on 57th Street.  All right.  Well, that didn't make the radio, but, well, it made it for the XMers.  Which is good.  What did you have to arrest him?  I apologize for that.  He had to... 
[01:28:00]  Did you tase him?  And he happened to do that in the garbage can down on the street.  So Keith, the cop is, you know, rounding up the homeless people.  Yep.  We're getting that going because the homeless shopping spree is going to be happening, I  think, December 16th, somewhere around there.  Yeah.  And he's got a guy downstairs.  We're trying to get him up, and now he's...  He's using one of the garbage pails as we use the bathroom.  That's right.  And...  That's right.  So he's having a tough time getting him up here.  Getting past security because when you do that in front of a building, usually the 
[01:28:30]  building people don't allow you in.  They assume you might use something else as a toilet.  Right.  So we need somebody to watch his dog so I can get him upstairs before we lose this guy.  Oh, okay.  So someone has to do a little dog watching so we get the homeless guy up.  What kind of dog is it?  Is it like a big Roddy or is it a little thing?  It's like a pit bull.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  All right, Keith.  The dog's probably like, please, when he goes upstairs, just give me...  Could you take me home?  Just give me a loving home.  Please scratch me behind the ears. 
[01:29:00]  Just get me out of here.  I just want some love, and this guy really stinks.  Yeah.  You should smell him when he comes in from a rainstorm.  I was going to play the...  Nothing worse than wet homeless guy.  I was going to play the cake stomping for Bill Burr, but it's too long.  Yeah.  Check it out.  Check it out on YouTube.  The worst part of it was when he, as a homeless guy, is hungry, obviously, has his cake, and  he just was so happy that we were all around and said, he goes, everybody, treat yourselves.  Like he was offering the cake to everybody. 
[01:29:30]  And Opie decided it would make a good trampoline.  I got some good air, too.  And the guy just went like, oh, I earned that cake.  Oh, he was so dejected.  Me and Jimmy, we had to leave the situation.  I wanted to leave the city.  It was that bad.  And, of course, you went out and you bought him another cake because...  He was taken care of.  He was taken care of.  He was taken care of to the point where we hadn't seen him in weeks.  If we haven't seen him since, we'll talk to him today. 
[01:30:00]  What?  I was hoping he'd be like, no, we just left.  Nah, he was taken care of.  That day, I think he got like three bucks.  No, he did all right.  We'd given him a lot of money beforehand.  Nothing but death threats since, Bill.  Well, that's great.  That means you're doing a good job.  All right, we can put...  Hold on.  Death threats are good press.  All right, we haven't played in a while.  Hold on.  This is...  We've got to get to the tease.  Oh, God.  You tease that.  You tease that goddamn kid.  We'll do it before break.  I want to know how old the child was. 
[01:30:30]  I promise.  I promise, I mean.  Here's the audio, Bill.  The video, like I said, is up on YouTube.  Okay.  Is this Andrew?  Hey, Andrew.  Wow, where have you been?  Look at that.  How you doing, Andrew?  I love watching the decline of Andrew.  Andrew, where the f*** have you been?  Andrew, they're taking your spot over there.  The guy took your spot with a box and a cat.  And my spot is a large spot.  Oh, yeah.  They're taking...  God bless me.  Paid that to me and his money.  Are you cold?  Are you cold today?  I'm cold.  Well, of course I'm cold.  Are you a little drunk?  You look a little woozy today. 
[01:31:00]  You look a little drunk.  No, I'm not drunk, but I had a couple of views.  A couple when?  About an hour ago?  Last night.  Oh, last night?  Yeah.  Partying with the guys?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  You guys?  Oh.  What is it?  Wow, that looks good, but I am not touching it.  You ate it, Andrew.  No.  It's some kind of a cinnamon cakey thing.  Oh.  Come on. 
[01:31:30]  I had to walk away.  Oh, no.  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I've never heard Jimmy do that.  Oh, he didn't do that.  Oh, he did not do that.  I earned that.  Oh, no.  I earned that.  He goes, that's not right.  You've got to love Jimmy.  Jimmy, actually, for half a second, is like, oh, no.  Jimmy was horrified.  You could hear it when Opie says, put it down. 
[01:32:00]  Jimmy knew and just went, oh, no.  Like, he knew it was coming.  And then when he stepped on it, cake, like, blew out, and it was just destroyed, and he's  like, oh, no, no.  Oh, no.  Why?  I earned that cake.  That's so bad for the guy.  The video's priceless.  It's up on YouTube.  Yeah.  We'll be talking to him today, though.  Yeah.  I want to ask him what he's been up to for the past month.  On the instant feedback, I thought everyone had seen the video.  They're asking the title.  It's Opie Smashes Homeless Man's Cake on Opie and Anthony's show. 
[01:32:30]  Throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  But then, you know, then Jimmy really just starts laughing.  That was with Sophie.  He's got the best laugh, too.  Yeah.  He did not just.  Oh, no.  You knew it was coming, right?  When I was, hey, let me see that.  It was a full cake.  It was a full cake.  He opened it up.  It was offering a slice.  Opie grabbed it, put it on the sidewalk, and jumped as high as he could and landed on 
[01:33:00]  top of the cake.  Oh, no.  Opie throws money at him, and as it's going towards him, the wind picks it and blows it  down.  Oh, no.  So he's like, just go f*** yourself.  As soon.  Oh, is that awful.  Oh, I know.  As soon as you put it down, I actually walked away, and I saw you jump up, and I walked away.  And just heard that smashing of cake under his feet.  You are despicable.  Oh, what a piece of s***.  That was his whole meal for like a week with that cake. 
[01:33:30]  He was happy to show everyone the cake.  He goes, look.  Both feet.  Both feet landed right in that cake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was beautiful.  Oh, it was so cringe-inducing, yet fun to watch.  Oh, my God.  You are horrible.  Please get that video up on YouTube immediately.  Thank God it was on tape.  Oh, no.  Oh, that is going to be a great download, man.  Jimmy's laugh is great. 
[01:34:00]  Jimmy's laugh is the best.  I hope he's just laughing like that.  Yeah, I don't think he's chuckling like that this morning.  No, he's not chuckling at all.  He'll be fine.  Waiting for an update.  Whoa, whoa, what happened?  Hey, what happened?  Oh, man, who's this guy?  There you go.  Oh, boy.  Yo.  Oh, man.  There's a little more aggressive.  A little more aggressive.  Yeah, great.  Than other people we've had in here.  What?  What's up?  Hey.  What's up, bro?  Ain't no, what's up?  What's down?  I said, what's up?  Ain't no, what's up? 
[01:34:30]  It's what's down.  Okay.  Hey, Cheerios.  Hey, Froot Loops.  He just looked at Bill and goes, hey, Cheerios.  Why are you calling him Cheerios?  Yo, because yo,  he's tricked.  Ah.  Yeah.  Hey, man, don't touch me.  Down with that.  No one's touching you.  What?  Yo, I want my dog up here.  My dog's face up here.  What's up with the dog, bro?  Huh?  What's up with your dog, bro?  He said, my dog,  he got a heart,  he ain't got no pussy.  He's like me. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  What happened, bro?  Where, where, where?  There ain't problem with no five daughters.  Don't be taking no pictures of me.  What happened with, uh,  what happened now?  Where, where did things-  Tell me what happened.  What?  Tell me what happened.  Like, what happened with, uh,  Are you a homeless gentleman?  Yeah, I don't know.  No?  Oh, you got a place?  Man, listen.  Homeless?  Yeah.  Homeless ain't no word.  No?  I live in a four-  Yo, I live in a four-story cardboard condominium. 
[01:35:30]  Ah.  All right.  Wait, wait.  He lives in a four-story-  Four-story cardboard condominium.  A four-story cardboard-  Cardboard condominium.  Condominium.  All right.  That's, that's cool.  Yo, you want to come on party next Saturday?  A party next Saturday?  Yeah.  Where's that going on?  There ain't going to be nothing but me,  you, the roaches, and the mice,  and we're going to do it all night,  and we're going to do it real nice.  See, the rats are going to come in the fat.  Yo, baby, they're going to come in there  with nine million.  Hey, hey, smile.  Over here.  Don't take no pictures.  Hey, oh, oops.  You can't take pictures of the guy.  Why?  That steals his soul. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, smile.  He ain't stealing my soul.  Oh, there's another one.  Because pictures-  Smile, smile.  What?  Yeah, let me get that one, too.  Hold on.  A big smile.  Yeah, I'm psyched.  Whoa.  What's your name?  Huh?  What's your name?  What's my name?  Yeah.  You're my brothers from another mother.  We all got the same name.  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, I thought it was something else  I can say on the air here.  Hey, yo, man.  Put some motherfucking music on this shit. 
[01:36:30]  No, man.  No, man.  He thinks he's at a party or something.  Give me some motherfucking 50 cents  or some motherfucking stuff.  All right, all right.  We're going to run out of dumps.  All right, hold on.  I've got to turn his mic off for a second.  That's what it is about some people here.  Yeah, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Some people here in the city  don't understand FCC regulation.  No, not at all.  I don't know.  I didn't get the memo.  He's cursing.  I didn't get the memo.  He wants some 50 cents.  I don't know what it is.  A little 50 cents or something like that.  Maybe we could play a little music.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  I just want to know,  where did it all go wrong for you, bro?  How many years ago did it go wrong for you  where you weren't, like, working  and you got, you know,  where you couldn't get a home  and you live in a cardboard condo?  I'm going to be honest with you.  What happened?  Yeah.  You know what happened with me?  What happened, bro?  What happened?  Yeah, man, get that phone away from me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought that thing was a big rat.  Yeah.  So what happened, bro?  My brother from another mother.  What happened?  Yeah.  It just happened like this.  Yeah.  You know what?  What? 
[01:37:30]  Nothing went wrong.  So how'd you end up on the streets?  No reason.  Oh.  No treason.  It was choice.  So you just decided,  I'm not working.  I'm going to live on the streets.  Hell no.  Isn't that what you just said?  My twisted sister.  What happened?  Huh?  So what happened that led you  to live on the streets?  I chose to live in a box.  Most people don't do that.  I was watching, um...  At least he's honest.  I was watching, um, 
[01:38:00]  Beretta one night.  Beretta.  Remember Huggy Bear?  Huggy Bear was cool.  Remember the homeless guys  that let's sleep on the streets?  He was pimping.  Yeah.  Pimp with no hoes.  But I'm thinking of him.  You know what I mean?  He's pretty funny.  He's critiquing Beretta.  That's true.  He's a whole popcorn pimp.  Yeah.  With no salt, no butter,  and no cornmeal.  But I got a lot of cream.  Make a bitch think of  a great-grandmother  and make her scream.  You know what I mean?  Because y'all look at him.  No.  But all these homeless guys  have a great rap.  So you're watching Beretta, 
[01:38:30]  you're watching Beretta,  and what happens?  Huh?  I thought maybe  that was a turning point.  I saw a man laying on the street.  Yeah?  And he wanted to be a bum.  And you said,  that's for me.  No, I was like four years old.  Let me tell you something.  I'm going to tell you a story, man.  Oh, boy.  A story.  Check it out.  All right.  I'll check it out.  I walked down the street one day.  Uh-huh.  Me and my boy are Freddy Brooks.  Mm-hmm.  He's like,  no, we're like seven years old.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't yell monster in. 
[01:39:00]  He wanted to be a,  um,  a scum thing.  What?  Me, I,  no, he wanted to be a scum thing.  I wanted to be a bum.  You wanted to be a bum.  So you wanted to be a bum  for,  since you were a kid.  I wanted to be a bum  before I was a kid.  Do you feel like you've made it?  Wow, this guy,  like, fulfilled  what he wanted to do.  I fulfilled anything  I want to be.  You know?  Yeah.  You know?  We're going to go,  let me tell you something.  But you decided instead of,  what's your next dream?  You want to be a vagrant?  Domination is the heart  and feeling. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Of being who you want to be.  And anybody you want,  you choose to be.  So we have all  unlimited potential.  So you're totally,  you're totally free.  You feel now  you are free from,  this is uplifting.  I'm not free from nothing.  No?  No?  Because I thought  like homelessness  would give you freedom  because you don't have  to deal with,  you don't have to deal  with taxes  and getting up for work.  Homelessness,  alcoholism,  and drug,  you know what that is? 
[01:40:00]  Fear.  Anybody here  can give me  a definition of fear?  Uh,  definition of fear?  Yeah.  Fear.  How do you spell fear?  Uh,  F-E-A-R.  All right,  give me a definition of that.  Uh,  scary.  Gary.  No.  False evidence  appearing real.  What?  False evidence  appearing real.  False evidence.  Fuck everything  and run.  Fuck everything  and run.  Well,  wow. 
[01:40:30]  That I don't think  is a...  But that's the truth.  Wow.  False evidence  appearing real.  That's fear.  so it's not real.  Let me get that phone  out of my name.  That's a microphone.  It looks like a big rat.  Yeah.  The microphone doesn't look like a rat.  We need that to hear you.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  Yeah.  All right,  that's all good.  That'll work out.  It won't bite.  Great.  So where's my hamburger at?  All right.  Yeah.  Go get him a hamburger.  All right.  I'll get him a plate of me, man.  Keith,  go get him a hamburger.  What's your name, sir?  Bro,  you won't get played.  You'll get a burger.  My name is G-I. 
[01:41:00]  G-I.  All right,  get him a hamburger.  We'll talk to him  before we leave the show.  What?  I'm going to tell you something.  What?  All right.  Yo,  I'm going to give y'all something  right here.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Now,  are y'all going to college?  No.  No.  College.  I know my man right here.  He right here.  I know him.  You know him?  He from Homicide.  He knows him.  Yo, bro,  put the cuffs on me now.  No.  I killed a mouse last night.  He killed a mouse.  No, I'm joking.  All right.  By mouse, 
[01:41:30]  he means hooker.  He went to college, right?  Yeah.  All right,  check this out.  All right.  I bet you,  you can't recite anything,  right?  I give you a fourth grade thing,  right?  Mm-hmm.  That you can't recite.  From fourth grade.  Sounds like a challenge.  All right.  It's a powerful thing.  All right,  go ahead.  Go ahead.  What is it?  Yo,  you're in the Constitution  of the United States of America?  Mm-hmm.  He's a cop.  Of course he hasn't.  The Constitution.  The Constitution. 
[01:42:00]  You should know it, man.  Oh,  you break that law every day.  Anyway.  All right,  let's hear it.  Oh,  jeez.  I'm going to tell you.  Stealing my pitch.  That was my joke.  Preamble to the Constitution.  Anybody here.  How about you?  I give you a 51 cent food stamps  right now.  You want the preamble  and all the amendments?  No,  not the amendments.  Just the preamble  to the Constitution.  And I give 51 cent food stamps.  All right,  go ahead.  Do it.  How much of it?  Who,  me?  Yeah, 
[01:42:30]  do it.  Do it.  You know it?  We,  the people of the United States  of America,  in order to form  a more appropriate union,  to establish justice,  to ensure domestic tranquility,  provide for the government.  I watch Schoolhouse Rock, too.  Promote the general welfare  and security  and bless his liberty  to ourself and our prosperity.  I'm a drunk motherfucker.  Do a thing.  I don't remember  our forefathers  penciling that in.  I'm a American.  Maybe that part  was erased out.  Yeah,  they might have. 
[01:43:00]  After the hangover  wore off,  they decided,  well,  maybe that's not going  to be a good idea.  Let's do the emancipation  to the proclamation.  All right,  let's go get them a burger.  We got radio to do.  G.I.  The Emancipation Proclamation.  Nice to meet you, G.I.  Go get your hamburger.  Yeah.  Hey,  you want a burger, bro?  Yeah,  get the guy a burger.  Go.  Get the guy a burger.  There he goes.  All right,  listen,  we got to go back to the...  They're going to try  to get him out.  Oh,  this could be a situation.  He wants $50  to leave the couch. 
[01:43:30]  All right,  G.I.,  we'll talk to you  in a little bit.  He's in the frisk position.  He's going to hook you up.  Keith,  thank you.  We're trying out homeless guys  for the homeless shopping spree.  I wish we had a taser.  What do you think of that guy?  A little scary  for the homeless shopping spree.  Let me tell you something.  A little scary.  Could be the scariest guy  we've had  for the homeless shopping spree,  but I say he's in.  He's in for the homeless shopping spree.  He's the loose cannon  we need to be thrown in there  for the homeless shopping spree,  dude.  Yeah.  He's got to be in. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  He won't last the bus ride  before he kills somebody.  I love how he looks at Mike.  You're in homicide.  I know you.  Oh,  is that funny?  That was like 40 pounds.  Oh.  He just got out?  I said the tase is coming out.  Oh,  the tase is coming out.  All right,  listen.  Oh,  yeah.  Well,  that would be fun  to watch him get tased.  Wow.  Moving on,  Anthony.  Youngest person ever tased.  Speaking of tasing,  if we don't play this,  they're going to kill me.  So you said how young?  I thought. 
[01:44:30]  Oh,  boy.  I didn't turn the sound on.  Sorry,  pal talk.  I thought it was going to be seven.  Yeah?  12.  It's going to be 11.  It's six years old.  No.  And we got audio.  Wow,  I was really going low.  And we got audio.  Is this with the metal clamps?  Is it with the metal clamps,  Danny?  Is it?  Yeah.  All out taser?  So this is all out.  Why the hell do they tase a six-year-old?  I'm outraged.  It's got to be his older brother.  Give me that book,  Bill.  I need to start reading.  I think it's his older brother  who's eight. 
[01:45:00]  It was the taser,  but just to clarify,  this is not the audio of the kid  actually being tasered.  It's a news story about it.  Oh,  son of a bitch.  You bait and switched.  You bait and switched.  Gave the big...  Al Capone vault.  I can't believe that.  Yeah.  The big tease before the commercial break,  then the bait and switch.  Yeah.  That's what you did.  The people sat in their cars  and were late for work,  didn't go in  because they wanted to hear this audio.  You know what audio would sound like 
[01:45:30]  of a six-year-old being tasered?  It would be great.  Now I'm really pissed.  I want a juice box!  No juice box!  No juice box!  Right.  I'll do my homework!  You know how some of these kids  can be really...  Yeah.  ...obnoxious.  Knock it off now.  Now.  Knock it off.  Knock it off.  Make me.  Stop.  Make me.  Don't repeat everything I say.  Don't repeat everything I say.  Okay,  I'll do anything.  Stop.  I'll clean my room.  He's the boy who two years ago 
[01:46:00]  made headlines...  We were just appalled...  ...for apparently becoming  the youngest person ever  at age six  to get zapped  by one of these...  50,000 volts of electricity  pulsated through Isaiah's  little body.  Enough punch to knock  a grown man off his feet.  Police say after the tasing,  Isaiah, who stood 3 foot 5  and weighed 53 pounds,  threw up as he was being handcuffed.  I was terrified at the force 
[01:46:30]  that had to go through his body.  Calling it outrageous,  Isaiah's family is suing  the Miami-Dade police  and the school district  alleging the boys' civil rights  were violated  by use of excessive force.  Hmm.  That's rude.  You could have killed him.  I would think, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know.  What does a six-year-old do  that you need a taser?  I don't know.  They're going to tell us  in this next clip here.  God knows you'd want to.  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely want to. 
[01:47:00]  Some kid's having a temper tantrum.  Oh, no.  Who has not thought  about tasing a six-year-old?  Bam.  Right.  Brian in D.C.  Taking a nap.  Yeah, as much as I would love  to hear about tasing kids,  and I have two,  I want to know  what happened in Norton.  Oh, we're waiting  for an update.  Waiting for details, sir.  Yeah, legally,  we can't say anything.  You'll be the second  or third to know.  As soon as we know more,  we'll let you know  about his arrest.  Oh, we're done.  Thanks, Brian.  Um, let's see.  Why the boy has to be tased.  Here it is.  The details of what happened 
[01:47:30]  to Isaiah at the school  that day are disputed,  but he was sent  to the principal's office  for misbehaving.  Police say they found him  in a corner  with blood smeared  on his finger  and forehead  from a broken picture frame.  He was holding  a small half-inch piece  of glass in his hand.  We had a highly agitated  six-year-old  who a number of people  could not disarm.  But was he agitated  and was a taser  the best way  to handle him?  In sworn depositions 
[01:48:00]  to internal affairs,  two female police officers  said they spent  up to 15 minutes  talking to the boy,  standing still  at eye level  and got close  within two arms lengths,  one standing near enough  to catch him.  Officer Abbott.  I was telling him  about the taser.  I said,  baby, this hurt,  you know.  You ever seen this?  Anybody talk to you  about it?  He was still  in a trance.  It was like  he was in a trance.  He still wouldn't  talk to me. 
[01:48:30]  How about  you reach over  the two arm lengths  and grab the kid's arm?  You're a cop.  Baby, this hurt.  Just from the quote,  you know,  it was a female officer  who was probably black  because she quoted  as saying,  baby, this hurt.  This gonna hurt.  It was Monique.  Monique.  Baby, let me tell you.  Couldn't she have  taken care of the problem  with a smack to the fanny?  You could distract them  with a pinwheel  and lunge at them. 
[01:49:00]  Or if you had to get physical.  It's a kid.  Why not just a front kick?  Yeah.  That'd stop him  right in his tracks.  Hold up a Barney the Dinosaur.  You're just right here.  Wham!  Yeah, anything  distracts a six-year-old  like that.  Right.  And then you just  grab his arm.  I don't know.  It must have been  a lot more fun  to tase them, though,  because a six-year-old  police supervisor  gave permission  to tase.  And officials  back up the decision. 
[01:49:30]  Another officer  called a supervisor  to ask whether  they could tase  someone so young.  Officer Rivera.  At the beginning,  he thought I was joking.  Then he told her,  you guys do  what you got to do  and I'm on my way.  The boy was tased.  Police say his body  was rigid.  I just don't understand  how two grown  people couldn't have  taken the glass  out of his hand  or tried  without having  to use the tase.  Right after the incident, 
[01:50:00]  police director  Bobby Parker  said this.  They made a determination  and a determination  that I back  that they utilized  a taser to disarm  the child.  The child was not injured.  Let this be a message  to all you six-year-olds.  A foot and a half away,  they certainly could have  taken one more step  and simply quickly  reached down  and grabbed his hand.  The glasses...  My struggle.  He's three foot five  and he weighs 53 pounds.  We can't lose sight of that.  These are grown,  trained police officers  and parents. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that's pretty  effed up, man.  Were they both women  police officers?  Well, someone...  It sounds like, yeah.  I think someone  on the Instant Feedback  figured it out.  Bum on 42nd Street,  probably a midget cop  and she felt threatened.  Yeah.  She was scared.  I don't think guys  would have tased a kid.  You can't go back  to the friggin' precinct.  No, you couldn't.  You tased a what?  A six-year-old?  Ooh, were you threatened  by his building blocks?  Yeah.  Drop the Lego, drop it. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  Well, that stupid guy humor  at that point.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you have to, though.  He comes back.  He's going to hit you  with a pacifier.  That's what it is.  Ooh, look out.  He's got a baby bottle.  Dude, six years old.  Right.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  And then what's going on over here? 
[01:51:30]  We might have to skip the milk thing  for today.  God damn it.  Well, two weeks from today  is the eggnog drinking contest,  number three.  It's a great day of radio.  And we have begun trying out people  for the contest.  But this guy showed up.  He was going to try to drink  a gallon of milk in an hour.  It's like an old fraternity thing.  We're building stuff up  and nothing happens today.  I know.  Well, what can I tell you about that?  No audio with the six-year-old.  Well, the stupid...  He's going to drink.  The stupid guy, though.  No ID.  What can I tell you? 
[01:52:00]  No ID.  No ID.  The homeless guy can come up.  Yeah, we'll get the homeless guy back in.  Jesus, he's frightening.  All right, we're going to try to do...  He'll show his passport.  We're going to try to do a speed round  when we get back.  Bill Burr in for Jim Norton.  Thanks once again, Bill, for...  No problem.  No problem.  I just hope he's all right.  When we get back,  we've got two things  we're going to try to do  before we leave this part of the show.  Gay penguin children's book,  Under Fire.  And...  Can you get deer  with a dead deer?  Get deer. 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  Ugh.  It's a cute story about a man...  He argues sex with dead deer  is not a crime.  We've got the story.  Oh, okay.  And still waiting for an update  on Jimmy's arrest.  Yeah.  It's the O&A virus  spreading across America.  Jingle bell, jingle bell,  jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree  only on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall. 
[01:53:00]  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. and Anthony Show  will bring a busload of homeless  degenerate shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course,  are invited to watch  and shop along.  Golden funds is gonna get busy.  Immerse yourself  in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit  and the stench of booze and vomit  as we partake  in another homeless shopping spree  on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Bye!  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, we gotta go 
[01:53:30]  into a speed round here.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh.  By the way,  I wanna thank Bill Burr  for my football picks this week.  The football picks  are sponsored by  Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  $10,000 up for grabs.  I'm in second place  with everybody.  Steve's in the lead  and then we're all  in second place.  Now that I picked the Colts  for some stupid reason.  I like that pick.  I'm picking the Cowboys.  I don't know.  You went Bears 
[01:54:00]  over my Jets.  I think the Bears  are gonna bring the Jets  back down to Earth.  I think I'm with you.  That always happens.  You beat a big team  and then you're all psyched.  Plus it's back-to-back  huge teams.  And then you got  the Bills at home.  Thank you for that pick.  The Lions at home.  Thank you.  Buccaneers over the Redskins.  Redskins are awful.  But the Redskins are at home.  Buccaneers kind of stink too.  That's what I'm saying.  Ah, you gotta have a few.  Yeah, come on.  And Cowboys at home, 
[01:54:30]  but you say the Colts  go into Dallas  and beat the Cowboys.  I think they're on a mission  this year.  As much as I hate to say it.  All right.  Someone said Jimmy  was on the phone.  I don't see him.  Oh, is he calling in?  Yeah, he was supposed to.  I gotta hear this story.  Nah, he's not there.  All right, anyway.  Bill Burr in studio today. 
[01:55:00]  He's playing the Stress Factory  all weekend long.  I think I'm going tonight, Bill.  I gotta support Bill Burr.  Stress Factory's a great club.  Little Shelter, Anthony.  Dog.  This place is cursed.  Getting tased.  Nothing but adversity.  Little Shelter, quickly.  You know Marge.  She's called us every time  she needs a few bucks  for the Little Shelter  out there in Huntington.  I don't know how the hell  she got in touch with us,  but she's always trying  to get money or something  for the Little Shelter.  She was in the news  the other day 
[01:55:30]  because they have  a couple of dogs  with cleft palates.  Oomph!  Oomph!  Oomph!  Oomph!  Those must look adorable.  Little friggin'  cleft palate dogs.  And she needed  some kind of donation  made by a vet  that could come  and fix these things,  so she was on the phone.  A vet to donate his time, yeah.  She was on the news  and everything  all over the country  yesterday  wanting a vet for these.  Well, today,  the Little Shelter  in the news again.  A fire in the basement  of Huntington's Pet Shelter 
[01:56:00]  forced the rescue  of 16 dogs this morning.  The dogs were pulled  from the Little Shelter  on Warner Road  just after midnight.  According to the shelter,  none of the dogs  were seriously injured  and no firefighters  were hurt.  Fire officials say  the fire was confined  to the basement.  The cause,  under investigation.  All right.  You think a little  Jewish lightning?  I think it's Marge.  Marge herself?  She's finally had it.  Are you implicating Marge  in this?  She's finally had it.  I've had it.  Just running around  in her nightgown  just flicking matches  all over the place. 
[01:56:30]  Throwing gas on the floor.  She's just had it.  Throwing a flare in there.  Yeah.  I'll show these dogs.  F the dogs.  Right.  I've had it.  Burn, you little bastards.  Right.  Burn.  We've got to get Marge  on the phone.  We're trying right now.  Just more trouble  for this little shelter.  The poor little shelter.  Oh.  Anthony, with that,  it's Taser Day  on the Opie and Anthony Show  kind of threw this at you.  Yeah.  We're getting to that  in a second, Bill.  No worries.  We end with the deer guy.  That's him. 
[01:57:00]  Dog attacks officer.  Officer tases dog.  As he returns to his car,  the dog tears off the leash  and attacks Shedrick  to defend himself  and kicks down the dog.  He continues to charge him.  That's when Shedrick  draws his weapon.  In this situation,  an officer has a right  to shoot,  but Shedrick doesn't.  Another officer uses  a taser,  a non-lethal weapon  that temporarily  paralyzes an attacker,  but the dog  quickly shakes off the shock  and runs away  with the barb still  in his back.  Wow.  That's great. 
[01:57:30]  Even a vicious dog.  Did you hear him?  Yeah.  Which is the dog equivalent.  Yeah.  Look, man.  I can be  and do whatever I want, man.  You're no authority over me.  I'm a dog, man.  All right.  Sit.  Stay.  Stay.  That's exactly what it is.  The dog equivalent  of just totally changing  your whole outlook.  Complete 180.  Oh, and he did, yeah.  Turned around,  ran away with the barbs in him.  That's great. 
[01:58:00]  We only did half the stuff  we wanted to  on this side of the show,  but this is just  a great story.  Marge from Little Shelter.  Now we got Marge.  We got to make it short, Anthony.  Got to talk to Marge, though.  All right.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Marge, what happened?  I'm reading about this now.  You're out of fire.  Well, it's not as bad  as it's portrayed.  It was a very, very small fire  in the main house,  and none of the animals  were there.  Thank God.  All right.  Very good.  Cool.  So. 
[01:58:30]  Isn't that really all  we needed to know?  Yes.  She got all the info out.  Not a big deal.  Not a big fire.  Main house.  None of the dogs hurt.  Marge doesn't know  how to work it.  She would have got a lot  of exposure  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, God.  You think when the news crews  went to the little shelter  and the cameras are rolling,  the reporters are there,  Marge, please tell us  what happened.  What happened, Marge?  It's horrifying fire.  And she gives that story.  You know the reporters just,  oh, guys, just packing.  Let me tell you,  it wasn't a problem at all.  It was really a match. 
[01:59:00]  You know she's still talking.  Oh, yeah.  Ten minutes before she really  was talking to you.  Hello?  It's a bastard.  All of a sudden,  you see the camera guy  just like powering down.  Yeah.  All right.  Pack it up.  I was able to put it out  with a wet Q-tip.  The camera guy's doing  the wrap it up movement  with his finger in the air.  The cameraman's like,  oh, hell.  Well, I heard there's a drive-by  and there was a drive-by  and wine damage.  Let's go check that out.  Storm damage in East Northport.  A tree fell on a car.  Let's take the cameras down there.  Right, exactly.  That's what we need to do. 
[01:59:30]  It's right around the corner.  Screw this broadener.  Fire.  All right.  Headline is,  can you get deer  with a dead deer?  They have to make the puns.  They have to.  Wisconsin Motion argues  sex with animal carcass  not a crime.  It probably isn't a crime  technically on the books  because what sicko  would even have to write it  as a crime?  And we're looking at the sicko right now.  Yeah, this guy is...  his hair still sweaty  from doing his business  with the deer. 
[02:00:00]  With a dead deer.  Oh, this is a creepy-looking blockhead.  Yeah.  Well, what is he?  What is going through your head  at that point  as of taking the mug shot  and you know it's going out  to all the papers  that you humped a dead deer?  Yep.  Dead deer.  Dead deer.  Where can I move?  Where can I move?  El Salvador.  El Salvador or Colombia.  Well, here's the story.  Meet Brian James Hathaway.  His name is Brian James Hathaway? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Doesn't sound like...  Sounds like a rich  white person's son.  Yeah.  He looks like...  Esquire.  Yeah, Esquire.  He looks like he just crossed the border.  He looks like he just had sex  with a dead deer.  Oh, that too.  Meet Brian James Hathaway,  alleged venison lover.  The Wisconsin Man 20  is facing charges  that he had sex last month  with a dead deer.  Hathaway,  who previously has served time 
[02:01:00]  for killing a horse  he intended to sexually assault...  You know,  why do y'all gotta kill the animals?  They're not gonna rat you out,  you idiot.  Do you realize that this guy,  he's at that level  right before you become  a serial killer?  Oh, absolutely.  That's what they always do.  They get into porn,  and then they start torturing animals  and this guy is now  actually having sex with them.  This is basically  the next Night Stalker.  Yeah, that's him right there.  This guy needs to be killed.  They just saved  a dozen Asian boys.  Yeah.  Having their heads drilled open. 
[02:01:30]  His brains sucked out.  He's got a meat freezer  in his apartment.  He had done order.  He was all set, right?  Like, yeah,  there's a big UPS truck  pulling in front of his house  but he's not there.  Yeah, it's like  I got this freezer.  The entertainment system  for a serial killer.  Instead of the flat screen,  you got the meat freezer.  A drill.  Yeah.  Various hatchets  and cutlery.  Oh, what a creep.  Yeah, this guy's  killing animals  and then having sex with them.  Yeah, he served time  for killing a horse 
[02:02:00]  he intended to sexually assault.  Allegedly found the deer  in a ditch  alongside a roadway.  So he didn't even kill it?  It was road kill?  Ugh.  It's a little road kill?  Most people drive by  and go,  oh, he goes,  ah, it's asking for it.  Yeah, look at it  just laying there.  You're a whore.  Huh?  You like your little  white tail in the air?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pulling on the antlers.  You like that, huh?  Depending on how it's,  yeah, sitting there  on the side of the road.  Maybe the white tail  was up in the air  a little higher  than the antlers. 
[02:02:30]  Looking, going,  yeah, all right,  this one's just asking for it.  I like how they said  he killed a horse  with the intention  to sexually assault it.  It's like,  was he standing over it  with like an erection?  Yeah, what happened?  How could he possibly  kill the horse  and have the intent  to have sex with it  and then not?  Yeah.  Like they caught him  after it happened,  like you said,  and then...  Pants down around the ankles.  Ready to rock.  Want to get away?  So allegedly he found 
[02:03:00]  the deer in a ditch  alongside a roadway.  Now Hathaway's lawyer  has filed a court motion  arguing that  since the animal  was already dead,  Hathaway should not face  a misdemeanor rap  of sexual gratification  with an animal.  The statute does not prohibit  one from having sex  with a carcass.  Lawyer,  you have to get a lawyer  to defend you on this one.  That there's no law  against having sex  with a carcass.  Yeah, that lawyer  Frederick Anderson wrote  in the motion filed 
[02:03:30]  in blah, blah, blah  as reported  in today's blah, blah, blah.  In response to Anderson's motion,  prosecutor blah, blah, blah  noted that state criminal statutes  did not seem to draw a line  between the living  and the dead.  Judge blah, blah, blah,  who heard motions  blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah,  said he will issue  a decision by December 1st.  How do you make eye contact  with this guy  if you're his lawyer?  You just don't, right.  You just stare at the file  just going so he was dead,  right?  He was definitely dead?  So, it was dead.  Yeah, yeah, it was dead. 
[02:04:00]  Okay.  Because they're going  to come back at us now  if it was alive  and you had sex with it.  See, there's a problem.  Did you ejaculate  at any moment?  Was there any...  Okay.  All right.  But as long...  If it was dead,  then we got a case.  I just think  there was a lot of muttering  just looking down at the table.  Oh, you're going  with the muttering lawyer?  Just rubbing your forehead,  just going...  Real hard at the brow.  Oh, is it a full-grown deer?  At least so it's...  Yeah.  It was an underage deer. 
[02:04:30]  It's better if maybe  he had sex with a wolf  because the jury  would be afraid of the wolf  and maybe could sympathize  with you as opposed to the wolf.  Any angle.  Just trying to...  Any angle.  Brown-eyed deer.  How long do you figure  it was dead?  Was it, like, freshly...  Had you been drinking?  Yeah, please say  you were drinking.  Is there any drugs involved?  You could say that, you know.  I'm not here to push you  to say anything,  but you could say that.  You've got to give me  something here, man.  Could you dry your hair  before you go into the court? 
[02:05:00]  Before the mugshot  because you look like  you're still excited.  That's the whole thing.  Could you mop up  the sex sweat?  I'm not saying you are,  but it's my job  to look out for you  and these people  are going to think that you...  You think it's going to rain today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to change the subject.  We didn't mention antlers, did we?  Yeah, I was saying  pulling on the antlers.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Because that would make it  a gay experience as well.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You can't use the antlers.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  That's sick.  Yeah, that makes it twisted.  I mean, let's  throw the line somewhere.  Unless, of course,  you've got to realize  what he was doing.  Was he doing normal  or, you know,  what was he using?  Was he using...  I don't know.  He's got like...  Because there are  a couple of choices  on a deer,  a dead deer.  In defense of him,  he has big brown deer eyes  himself, maybe...  Very doe-eyed.  Very doe-eyed.  Maybe they...  I don't know.  He looked into  that dead doe eye.  It looked like a... 
[02:06:00]  Could you see  if he was grabbing...  A bad piece of fish.  ...grabbing the antlers  and doing it that way?  Oh, God.  Like, that's even...  For some reason,  that's even sicker.  Who about the people  driving by down the highway?  Yeah.  Hey, there's something  you don't see every day.  Did he just kill it?  He's trying to tie it  to his front bump.  He seemed to be  struggling with it.  Because the last thing  I could possibly think  is that he's trying  to have sex with it.  There's no way.  No, you would think,  yeah, he's struggling 
[02:06:30]  with it.  He shot it.  He hit it with his car.  I would think that the deer  attacked him.  You know when they do  that front hoof thing?  Yeah, very dangerous.  And it knocked off his belt  and maybe his pants came down.  His pants fell down  because of the deer  hooves hitting his pants.  He's struggling with it.  Yeah.  He's just taking some Cialis  from his little ride.  Because he's on his way home.  Yes.  He has some problems.  But he's on his way home  to his loving wife.  And as the car pulled up  to see him,  he had just snapped  the deer's neck.  And that's why  the deer was dead.  In a battle  for his own life. 
[02:07:00]  This is how the lawyer  is going to present it.  And he's going to be  looking down  at the courtroom floor  muttering the whole time  rubbing his forehead  just knowing  they're not violent.  You know some dope  drove by too  and said that's such  a weird way  to put a deer  on a roof of a car.  Yeah.  He's pushing  and pulling  at the same time.  That's not going to work.  He's pushing  and pushing.  Hello, physics class.  Right.  I wonder if I should  stop and help.  Yeah, you need a hand  there, buddy.  Right.  What about his family?  No, I'm fine. 
[02:07:30]  His family's got to  come down and bail him out  just like,  yeah, I'm arrested.  What'd you do?  A drunken ballroom  ballroom fight?  No.  No.  It's a sexual assault.  Oh, no.  Don't worry.  It wasn't human.  Yeah, it wasn't a person  and it wasn't even alive.  So don't get on me.  So don't get on me.  In a deer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  In a ditch.  I don't know.  I guess, you know,  deers can have, you know,  some sexy lines  about them, you know. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Alive.  Kind of cute.  It might have been, uh...  Big eyes.  Don't they call deer,  male deers, deers,  and then...  They're all deers, I guess.  They're all deer,  but then there's a buck  and a doe.  Yeah, okay.  Never mind.  I'm trying to make this story a day.  I hope it was a doe.  I'm just trying to make this story a day.  If it was a buck.  Oh, boy.  All right.  That's how we end it.  The headline would have been different.  Yeah.  Bill Burr, thank you so much.  Yeah, they could use a different pun.  Yeah.  You know they all did that one.  Of course they did,  but it didn't pass the censors. 
[02:08:30]  Who you got with you tonight?  Oh, working with me,  Bernadette Pauly,  and, um...  I forget the other guy.  But everybody was funny.  It was a great show last night.  Oh, very cool.  Bill Burr at the Stress Factory  in New Brunswick, New Jersey,  all weekend long.  Tickets are going fast,  so if you're thinking about it,  I would call immediately  as soon as they open.  Yeah, I had a great time last night, too.  All right, very good.  I was on.  I'm going to try to get down there, Bill.  Okay, cool.  Support Bill Burr.  Thanks for coming in for Jim Norton today.  We greatly appreciate that. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, let me know what happened with that.  Yeah, well, we'll be at XM.  Hopefully we'll get an update.  Today's Football Picks  was sponsored by Dish Network.

Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton  and the comedians  of the Opie and Anthony Show  are appearing  in a special holiday edition  of FHM on sale now. 
[02:10:00]  E-Rock's creepy photos  from the FHM shooter  now online  at opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover  begins now.  What a scene outside today.  Oh, yeah.  What's his name again?  G.I.?  G.I.  G.I.'s got his dog.  It's homeless shopping season time  because we talked  to our first homeless guy.  It's G.I.  He's out here now with his dog  entertaining the crowd  that came out for the walkover. 
[02:10:30]  That dog looks like  it could be owned  by Martha Stewart.  Yeah, it's very well-kept  and it looks very healthy.  It really is.  Nice collar.  It's all legal.  G.I. is threatening  the people  that came out today  for money.  He's intimidating them  with his dog  and his ethnic background.  He's spitting  all over the place.  Yeah, he is spitting  when he talks.  Yo, man,  fuck for the thing.  They've got none on G.I. 
[02:11:00]  Give us a little freestyle.  Drop a beat.  Yo, check it out.  Drop a beat.  Let's go.  You're live.  All right, check it out.  Here we go.  I was born.  I was born with a penny.  But I'm going to tell you  one thing.  Me and Snoop get many.  But I'm going to tell you  one thing where I come from,  son.  But you don't know,  man, motherfucker.  You got to the gun.  But I'm going to tell you  one thing about me, baby.  They call me A-I-Z, baby.  No, I ain't got time right now.  Oh, wow. 
[02:11:30]  That was all right.  That was all right.  Yeah, right on.  Hey, get over here  and get my baby, man.  Better than Flavor Flav.  I'm going to keep  your goddamn six back.  Yo, man,  don't be playing with me.  You know,  I was looking the other day.  I think Miles Davis  is the illegitimate father  of Flavor Flav.  Yeah?  You see him in his drug years  in the 80s,  how skinny and crazy.  There is a resemblance there.  The same gray tone, too.  All right, why don't we walk with G.I.?  Yeah, let's walk with G.I.  And hopefully we'll see Andrew  as we go down the street.  All right. 
[02:12:00]  And we have a big thing  of danishes.  Is anybody going to talk about  how G.I. has the Knicks jacket  of an eight-year-old?  You got that at the baby gap.  Just a bike wheel.  Enjoy your weekend.  Thank you, sir.  You too.  You too.  He's one of the good ones.  Oh, boy.  Andrew was sweeping  up and still happy.  Anthony Andrew is there.  Oh, good.  This is the first time  here's Andrew.  This guy's dressed  like a Native American.  Fabio. 
[02:12:30]  There's old guy's dog.  Old guy's dog.  Old guy's dog.  Thank you, miss.  Thank you, ma'am.  What'd she say?  She said, good show.  Oh, thank you.  And here is Andrew.  Hi, Andrew.  How have you been?  We missed you.  Good morning.  Good morning.  We missed you so much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  You know, I really don't  come here too much 
[02:13:00]  because another guy  has been around.  The other guy,  he's what?  He kind of chases you  out of here?  Yeah.  Does he?  I don't want to go into,  you know.  Into what?  My lord is my savior.  Yeah.  See if he even  remembers the cake stuff.  Yeah.  I bet you he doesn't  even remember.  Really?  I don't remember,  I don't even remember  the last time we saw you.  When was that?  I would say about,  I would say about a month.  About a month already  it's been?  Yeah.  What happened?  Make me remember what,  Because you know,  that guy had a whole 
[02:13:30]  camp here with a box.  Yeah, with the box  and everything.  And he had a cat litter.  Right, all kinds of stuff.  Yeah, yeah, all kinds of stuff.  I can't remember though  because we talk to you a lot.  Is there anything about that day  that stands out in your mind?  Well, on that day  that we talked about was,  you remember you asked me  to draw a swastika?  You made the swastika  out of the pennies?  I love your Bob Denver haircut,  by the way.  You know what? 
[02:14:00]  What the Lord has given me  has given me.  Right.  You got to work with  what the Lord has given you.  He's the Bangladesh Bob Denver.  He is.  The Bangladesh building.  I cannot be choosy.  No, no.  It made me, it made me.  I mean, uh,  Bob Denver.  Oh, my God.  That is really good.  But you don't, uh,  there's nothing else  that stands out in your mind  from the last time we spoke?  I'm trying to remember.  Yeah, well, I guess.  Hey, who's throwing dollars at him?  You remember now? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I'll give.  I'll show you one of these.  Here, don't lose that one.  You know, you guys,  you know, you guys  were very helpful to me.  Very helpful?  Yeah, yeah.  That was helpful, yeah,  just in case you had to  get rid of a cake.  Well, are you hungry?  No, I, because...  No, I got food.  Believe me.  Oh, you got food?  Okay.  Here's what I'm thinking.  I remember, I remember something.  Okay.  Uh, now you had said that day  that you had a couple of beers.  Yeah, you know.  A little bit of a buzz.  Once in a while.  And you had pulled out a box 
[02:15:00]  and in the box was a cake.  Do you remember the cake?  And you said,  treat yourself.  Yeah, although you stamped on the cake.  Not me.  I remember.  This son of a bitch.  Somebody stamped on the cake.  Yeah, yeah.  Will you leave Keith Moon alone, please?  The guy had given me cake and donuts.  Yeah, and, uh, and, and Opie over here, 
[02:15:30]  he, uh, jumped on the cake  and you said you earned that cake.  That's true.  How did you earn the cake?  Sir, when you're sitting here,  when I'm sitting here, right?  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm putting my self-esteem down.  Your self-esteem, right.  You know.  Yeah.  So you're earning it  with a bit of your dignity  and pride and self-esteem.  I mean, I really don't like to be here,  but yet I have to be here, you know,  in order to survive.  You got a nice new blue jacket, though. 
[02:16:00]  Is that keeping you warm?  This is, look, how many jackets  I got underneath.  You got like three, four jackets.  You know, because it's cold.  It's starting to get cold.  You've been lucky here, though.  It hasn't been that bad.  You know, I have to,  I have to go to a lot of hell every day.  Well, Andrew, I'll tell you something.  Because of the cake thing,  uh, we wanted to bring you something.  We felt a little bad about the cake thing,  and we got a bunch of danishes  and cupcakes and,  and stuff for you.  Oh.  Uh, bagels.  So take that. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, my God.  If you would have kicked that,  I'd have, you know,  so take that and share.  You know, treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  God bless you.  And, uh, you got,  you got any friends down by the church?  God bless you.  You got friends down by the church  who can share it with them?  Happy Thanksgiving to you guys.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Next time, bring a turkey,  and Opie can step on your turkey.  Oh, no.  Enjoy those pastries, right, Andrew?  That would be very, very mean.  Andrew.  Now, here's what we want to do.  We want, we are offering you 
[02:17:00]  an invitation every year.  The Cursy Green.  Oh, boy.  We got G.I., the other homeless guy.  G.I. is going to be a homeless.  This is going to be like Shaq and Kobe.  You know what?  We got a higher power  that'll make us all around.  You know what I mean?  We got a higher power,  not a lower power.  You know what it is?  You know what the power is?  Look in there inside.  You know, watch your face.  Don't let the dog eat his Danish.  No, my dog. 
[02:17:30]  No, my dog speaks many languages.  Look.  You know?  You could look at Andrew's face  and see this is the same type of guy  that has punched him in the face  800 times.  There was a look of fear  in his eyes.  I feel bad.  But no, thank you.  Yes, my friend.  You didn't feel bad about my eyes.  No, I didn't feel bad about your ass.  You might feel bad about my eyes.  You don't feel bad about my eyes.  Jesus Christ.  I don't feel bad about your eyes.  Here's what we want to do, Andrew.  Let you talk in a while.  Andrew, my name is Albrecht. 
[02:18:00]  Uh-oh.  No, God love you.  I love you, too.  Pull some David Copperfield shit  with your money cup.  What are you?  Make your money disappear.  Oh, look at that.  All right, right on.  All right, well.  Now, Andrew, here's what we want to do.  Andrew, listen to Anthony.  Here's what we want to do.  Every year, we get a bunch of guys from the street, homeless people, and we go to a mall.  Don't make us look like fools, sir.  Nah.  We go to a mall, and we call it homeless shopping spree. 
[02:18:30]  We give every...  You're taking the guy's 20.  He just goes, don't make me look like...  Don't make us look like fools.  And then he tries to grab a 20.  He tries to grab...  Yeah.  Why don't you put that in the cup and make sure this guy don't take it, Andrew.  Jesus Christ.  That guy's worse than a guy that would step on someone's cake.  You're kind of like that, rough like that, you know.  No, no.  You have dignity in life.  Yeah, you keep that in a pocket somewhere.  Yeah, you better hire that.  But here's what we want to do.  We get a bunch of guys, and then we go to the mall.  We give you guys a bunch of money so you can get some winter clothes and some socks and underwear and stuff like that. 
[02:19:00]  And a bunch of our listeners, they join us on the trip, and they take care of you pretty good.  And we like to invite you to that.  Okay.  This year.  It's on the 16th of December.  You might want to check your calendar if you have any appointments.  I have a good memory.  You have a good memory?  You didn't remember that cake stomping for a while, though.  No, but you know what?  All right, listen, Andrew.  Be here on the 16th at, I don't know, around, what, noon, 1 o'clock? 
[02:19:30]  It's early, right?  10 o'clock we're starting, or is it?  No, we're doing it in the afternoon.  I'll talk to you before then.  Okay, yeah.  He'll talk to you.  Yeah, he'll talk to you.  And we'd love to have you, and I think you'll be a great addition this year to our shopping spree.  Thank you, guys, and God bless you all.  All right.  And keep up the good work.  And treat yourselves.  Treat yourselves.  Treat yourselves, Andrew.  Treat yourselves.  There goes Andrew.  He made a killing today.  He really did.  Holy shit.  Thank you.  I think he got about 100 bucks and a big thing of Danish.  You know what's funny? 
[02:20:00]  We all yelled, treat yourself, and GI just went, ah.  You see how GI leaned over and tried to grab that 20 out of his hand?  Of course he did.  Jesus.  It's survival, man.  GI wants to go back there when we all walk away and just blindside him and punch him in  the side of the head.  Right, right.  And take everything he has.  That's not GI style.  No.  No.  He can say a bunch of rhymes, and he can convince you.  He said, GI saw that guy, sees Andrew as a dead deer on the side of the road who he 
[02:20:30]  wants to fuck.  Happy, sad, who could tell?  There's definitely that hierarchy.  There's definitely that hierarchy there that was taking place between GI and Andrew.  Absolutely.  Like GI is one of those guys that takes what he needs.  Yeah.  And Andrew is hoping on the chariot of people.  And GI would punch him in the face and take his money in a second.  All right.  Social commentary, Bill. 
[02:21:00]  I was going to say, that's just your fear.  Social commentary.  That's not his style.  No, that's not my fear.  That's my, actually, I feel good about that because then he won't punch me.  Do you notice boots are in with the ladies now?  Boots, yes.  Very big.  Somehow, you can tuck your jeans into your boots and not look like Slash.  Well, that's a long time.  That's come back.  It's a retro thing from the 80s.  The hooker boots?  That's come back.  Yeah.  God bless them.  It's a good look.  Now we're doing fashion.  Every year they subtly figure out a way how to kind of look like a whore. 
[02:21:30]  But if you bring it up, you're the asshole.  You're the fucking douchebag.  Right.  It's just the style.  God.  Let's go.  I like how in the middle of the crosswalk we switched from social commentary on the homeless  to fashion.  Can we talk about this guy and his awful bike?  Oh, what is that bike?  He stole it from Mary Poppins.  If your bike has a back fender, you deserve to get the shit kicked out of you.  With the reflector on the back. 
[02:22:00]  And it did.  Bob Denver comment.  We never even noticed that all the times we talked to him.  The Bob Denver haircut.  Bob Denver haircut.  Someone photoshopped Andrew as Gilligan immediately.  That is really funny, Bill.  Treat yourself.  Bill Burr.  Stress factory all weekend long.  Yes.  Waiting for the bus, huh?  Yeah.  That means you're poor.  Two weeks.  Two weeks. 
[02:22:30]  Opie.  Opie.  Love that.  She's going to spin her ear and Arnold Schwarzenegger's going to be inside of her.  Ooh, the La La game.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Oh, oh.  Love the La La game.  Wait, wait, wait.  Now, most people, these have to be foreigners because no one uses a payphone in New York  City.  Look at the boots.  See what I'm saying?  No one uses a payphone in New York City.  She's got her whore boots on.  Everybody's messing with her.  So right when the call goes through after.  Hi, hello.  No, no, no, no.  So right when the call goes through.  Yeah.  No La La game today. 
[02:23:00]  Damn it.  They couldn't get the call to go through.  Next time.  There's a phone gunked up with jizz.  There's an older woman trying to pull off the whore boots thing.  Not working.  No.  Oh, look at this disaster walking down the street.  You ever seen so many lopsided titties ever in your life?  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Somebody give somebody an uppercut.  Hi.  Hey, what do we got today?  We got a little tour or something?  Where are you from?  We're from England.  England.  Hey, here.  Welcome, welcome, welcome. 
[02:23:30]  Who's the whore in the group?  Where have we, uh...  Where's she gone?  Where'd she go?  Who's the goer?  You're the goer?  Who's the goer?  Yeah, she was a big...  You went in the day.  You're the goer of the group.  No, just the leader, that's all.  You went in the day.  Size queen?  We're going to Tiffany's today.  Tiffany's.  Ooh, buying anything?  Yes.  What?  Bracelet.  A bracelet.  You get the little blue box with it and everything and then take it back and say, look, we went  to Tiffany's and I got a $50 bracelet for $2,000. 
[02:24:00]  Well, there you are.  You know what?  You have to get one when you're here.  Just buy one off of the guy at the corner.  Are you a Bon Jovi fan?  It's a lot cheaper.  No, I only do the real thing.  I hear you.  Yeah, I know.  Bye, Inglaterra.  Bon Jovi.  All right.  Cheerio.  Cheerio.  Wow.  I figured I would just blurt out a cereal.  She went with that one.  I got a little nervous there.  Perhaps.  I guess it means goodbye.  What a coincidence.  All right.  We'll bring some people up again.  Yeah, some studio audience.  All right.  We'll bring some of you guys up.  Thanks for doing the walk, guys. 
[02:24:30]  Look at this guy's head.  He's sweating like he just fucked a dead deer.  Which one?  Which one?  Oh, there he is.  He really is.  Jesus.  Kind of looks like the guy, too.  Don't forget, on the walkover on Monday, we're going to have a shitload of stuff to give  away.  Oh, yes.  Don't miss that.  Including gift certificates for $200 off on Inno's, I believe.  Nice.  It's going to be a great walkover on Monday.  So, if you're in the area, please join us.  Did they ever sell any pianos in there?  I don't know.  Who knows?  How many?  I never see anyone wheeling one out. 
[02:25:00]  They just bought.  What's the deal?  You want a bag with that?  Paper or Plaston?  Some assembly required.  Let's see upstairs.  Bad 80s.  XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Angle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long. 
[02:25:30]  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, cornwalls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie. 
[02:26:00]  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:27:00]  Bill from Waterford. 
[02:27:30]  Will we have the dump report today?  Sounded like today could have been a record-setting day.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I got one in nice and early.  Dude, 47 bids for a PSP3 off of eBay.  Ah, the eBay report.  $9,100 they're up to on this one.  Stop.  No way.  No one is paying that much. 
[02:28:00]  No way.  It ain't gonna happen.  Holy crap.  It could be a record day.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you when...  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14...  Wow.  Just keeps going.  Is there a page two even?  Bill had a good three of them at the end of the show.  6, 11 a.m.  11 minutes in.  Mm-hmm.  What happened?  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[02:28:30]  Let's do the old intro here.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Wow.  It's a biggie.  6, 11.  You're full of fucking shit.  Bill Burr angry at Anthony's book review.  7, 04 a.m.  Did you say that Jim was blowing a tranny?  Caller.  7, 21 a.m.  I'm a fucking karaoke star.  That drunken caller woman. 
[02:29:00]  7, 24 a.m.  Like fucking bullshit.  The caller.  That's a punk rock girl.  And the same minute.  7, 24.  Because I fucking.  Caller.  8, 06.  The guy just pissed into the garbage can.  Keith the cop.  8, 13.  He ain't got no pussy.  Homeless guy.  8, 14.  I live in a fuck.  Now, this was a mistake on Al's part. 
[02:29:30]  Because I thought he said fuck, too.  I thought he said fuck, and then we realized when he said that, he had said something else.  Four story.  Yeah.  Because I live in a fuck.  Four story.  Four story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it sounded like I live in a fuck.  Four story cardboard.  But I'll accept the dump just because it's funny to say I live in a fuck.  That's a great album title.  I live in a fuck.  8, 15.  Many fucks and motherfuckers and a shit.  Homeless guy. 
[02:30:00]  8, 19.  Fuck everything and run.  Fear.  Homeless guy.  8, 19.  Fuck everything and run.  Opie repeating homeless man.  I just got into it.  After a while.  8, 21.  I'm a drunk motherfucker.  Homeless guy.  Reading the Constitution.  I wouldn't have known who that was if Steve had been in today.  Could have been either him or the homeless guy.  8, 51.  Standing over it with an erection.  I was trying to be clean with that. 
[02:30:30]  Erection, they don't like.  They don't like.  It's too descriptive of a hard cock.  During a lengthy discussion of a man having sex with a dead deer.  Exactly.  On the side of the road.  No rhyme or reason, my friend.  Yeah.  8, 52.  Did you ejaculate at any moment?  Ejaculating again.  Is this the 50s?  Yes.  Yes.  Can you say pregnant?  Don't say water closet or pregnant.  He was a little aroused. 
[02:31:00]  Bill Burr.  Now that is ridiculous.  I guess here's my logic on the whole thing.  Because the whole thing did revolve around sex with an animal.  That the aroused part.  You could say he was a little aroused in the context of just saying he was a little aroused without any detail.  But since we had dwelled so long on fucking a dead deer, that had to get dumped.  So I agree with all of them.  Look at me.  I close with a 8, 51, 8, 52, 8, 55. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Bam, bam.  Left, right, left.  Trying to catch up with the homeless guy.  Yeah.  A couple things.  I keep saying PSP3.  Sorry about that.  It's PS3.  eBay.  I got another one in front of me.  Winning bid, $30,300.  Bullshit.  Now stop it.  It's a joke now.  They're overbidding as a joke.  If it was Christmas Eve and they weren't going to have them out.  And you were so rich and your kid wanted it and they had cancer and it was their last Christmas ever.  And you had that much cash laying around. 
[02:32:00]  Maybe.  There was a tsunami coming and you knew you were going to die.  You just wanted to play a game before.  Right.  No.  No.  It's too much.  Let's go to Troy in Alberta.  Troy, what's up?  Hey, not much out of you guys today.  All right, Troy.  He's got freaking G.I., man.  He's hilarious.  You got to have him on the show more.  You like G.I.?  Oh, fuck.  He's hilarious.  G.I. was totally trying to rip off poor Andrew. 
[02:32:30]  You find out after we all left, I guess G.I. had kind of double-backed.  Who saw this, by the way?  We had an eyewitness.  Danny.  Danny.  Bring Danny in here.  But go ahead, Ann.  I'm sorry.  He had double-backed and was trying to pull something on Andrew to rip him off.  Started taking his pastries.  Yeah, that was it.  And then he started to grab at his money.  Yeah.  We were there when he tried to grab the 20 out of his hand.  But he circled back.  He knows.  Yeah.  He smelled blood.  He circled back.  He did smell blood, man.  He smelled blood.  What happened?  Because you had to go back and save Andrew? 
[02:33:00]  This guy's a handful.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know if we're going to...  We might have to pass on him, unfortunately.  He'll be all right.  He's just really drunk today.  He'll be...  Nah, I think we need him.  I know him for a long time.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, yeah.  I know him 10 years.  He's okay.  He just raked up today.  He's got love for you.  For me, personally?  Or just like everybody?  Well...  All right.  Don't get jealous.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Was that a gang sign?  What was this?  He's throwing up gang signs.  What was that?  What?  East side, west side. 
[02:33:30]  He looks like Maurice Cheeks.  Remember the guy who played for the 76ers?  You remember that guy?  He does.  Mo Cheeks.  Still talking about Philly, huh?  I guess I have no...  You've got a million of them.  I have no problems with Philly.  I know you don't.  It's just the crowd.  It's okay.  We're past it.  Okay.  We, uh...  So what happened, Keith, really?  No, yeah.  He did a little double back.  He actually just wanted a couple pieces of pastry.  For him and his dog.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He come over and he's Chase. 
[02:34:00]  Look at him.  What happened?  What's up, brother?  Ain't nobody about G.I. in the hair.  In the what?  What's up, brother?  It's from another mother.  What's up, G.I.?  Huh?  What's up?  I'm broke, busted, and goddamn disgusted.  Where'd you get the nice Knicks jacket?  Huh?  Where'd you get the nice...  Found it in a garbage can like everybody else.  Found it in a garbage can.  Wow.  That's a pretty good jacket, though, for a garbage can.  Well, you've seen their record, though, right?  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  True.  Well, how the Knicks are playing this year, it's not too far... 
[02:34:30]  That it's in the garbage can.  It's always them.  What?  Yeah.  We need a microphone so we can hear you, so...  Yeah.  Tonight is special.  Because it's a microphone.  G.I. is in there.  Oh, my God.  Not Mickey, but Mouse.  G.I., what's up with...  You had a couple of beers today, I guess?  Man, listen.  A couple.  Yeah?  A few.  Man, listen.  You drink like from when you wake up till you pass out, right? 
[02:35:00]  Man.  Yo, listen.  He just repeats the question.  I haven't passed out.  I come, too.  Oh, I hear you.  I hear you.  I don't understand it, but I...  If I don't fall down, I get up.  Right.  I got this whole thing, though.  Yeah.  No.  I don't know.  Like they say, we fall down when we get up.  All right?  Could be another hit.  Drew Boogie gets a hold of it.  97, right?  Who sings that?  Huh?  Who sang that? 
[02:35:30]  Yo, you don't feel that?  I don't know.  That's the Pastor Williams and the motherfucking High Power Cream.  Who is that?  Yo, you know what?  You know who got the greatest song in the world?  Well, who?  Who?  God.  What's his song?  Huh?  God hit the charts yet?  I give it to you and I give it to you, right?  I give it to you alive.  Yo, baby.  I take it out in a snap and that's right.  All right.  Yeah.  Why don't you sing God's song?  Huh?  Why don't you sing the greatest song ever?  Yo, you want to know what my name is? 
[02:36:00]  G.I.  No.  God's.  George.  My name is...  George.  God name my dude and I mean Issa.  Wow.  How do you spell that?  You know who Issa is?  No.  Oh, yeah.  He's in the Bible.  He's in the Bible.  Yeah.  Chapter 3.  I say my...  I say my...  I say my name.  I say my God name.  I say my...  Bill's made a great observation, by the way.  What happened? 
[02:36:30]  What's the observation?  Bill made a great observation.  What?  G.I. and Sam have the exact same hair.  Oh, my God.  He does.  I think that's his dad.  Could be his dad.  Is that your dad?  How great.  Is that your long lost father?  Does that smell...  Yo, what's up?  What's up?  I'm a mother and a father.  What?  I'm a mother and a father.  Most people do.  I'm a sister and no brothers.  No brothers, huh?  Sister, but no brothers.  Oh, you got lots of brothers.  I had seven brothers and... 
[02:37:00]  When was the last time you saw any family members?  Did he really?  25 years ago.  That's it?  Hey, G.I.  I'll bet you one thing.  You can call my father's phone right now.  This is a rough one.  Let's try to guess his age.  I get my brother's number, father's number.  I ain't seen him in 25 years.  Wow.  G.I.  You think he's...  G.I.?  You're G.I.  You think he's black?  Is he black or white?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at his hair and stuff.  You know what?  What's up?  It doesn't matter what he is.  It's how he feels about his stuff.  No, but G.I., you're...  Seriously, you think he's black, white? 
[02:37:30]  What do you think?  Who cares?  Does he have a little black blood in him, though?  Does it bother you?  I'm asking.  Nah, nah.  Did you or did you not...  When you come, do you like you black?  Did you or did you not call him a half-breed?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you called him a half-breed.  I got kids half-breed, too.  What?  Half-breed.  I'm a half-breed.  You're a half-breed?  Yeah.  You can tell by you got...  I'm just cool to swim here.  Like hazel eyes or something.  Yeah, he's got crazy eyes.  Damn.  Yo.  Crazy.  What y'all call, uh...  Crazy. 
[02:38:00]  He's got husky eyes.  What?  Dog sled eyes.  Him I got me.  Cool chaser.  Oh, my God.  That was a gallon of spit that just came out of his last spit coming out of you, G.I.  You all right?  That might be that flavor flavor.  The spit might come out, but you know what?  Some might come out.  But also some intelligence.  It's my money ain't coming out of my mouth.  Ah, there you go.  Whatever that means, I understand.  I don't know.  I always spent my way of saying it or something.  I don't know.  You know what I'm saying?  Never allow anybody in your life, you know, to destroy anything you feel about yourself. 
[02:38:30]  You know what I mean?  What they say about you don't matter.  Do you have any Whitney Houston music to play under anything?  What you say, think and feel about yourself.  You know what I mean?  That's the power in life.  You know what I mean?  I believe that children have a future.  I tell them they're going to make you.  Daddy's dick made you.  Daddy's dick made you.  Remember that.  Remember that.  You took daddy's dick to get your mommy and pop the dill.  G.I.  I had someone with so much wisdom.

Mm-hmm.  They threw me out the dump.  You know what my impulse was?  What?  They gave him a goddamn can.  I remember my motherfuckers.  Buildings are falling down and your impulse was to get your damn cans.  You weren't able to get your cans because of 9-11?  No.  See, the terrorists won.  Oh, you did?  Let me tell you something.  I was stuck over there at 25 Central Avenue. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Which they called, uh, Project Hospitality.  I was stuck over there for like, what?  Three weeks?  Yo, I saw them with trucks.  No motherfuckers.  Over there where they got the, uh, you know, like the mini, uh, Yankees or whatever that  thing is?  They had all them motherfuckers all laid out on their dead body bags.  Oh, yeah.  Yo, man, let me tell you something.  Yo, yo, let me tell you something.  You motherfuckers.  I woke up in the park.

What the fuck do you think?  People ask, did anybody die?  I was twisted.  Wait, people ask G.I.N.E.?  Yeah, and he goes, what the fuck do you think?  Holy shit.  Yo, you know I was motherfucking twisted.  Yeah, all right.  Let me tell you something. 
[02:49:00]  These young motherfuckers, they don't know that damn thing.  Nope, nope.  Keep going.  Yo, you know what?  Yo, you know why?  Why?  That their pants can't smack their ass.  I remember yo, man.  I'm 45 years old.  My uncles and them used to make me go out in there, man, when I was in South Carolina.  Go out in there and get three switches and bring them together.  And dip that shit in water.  My father let me stick a box.  Dip it in water.  Dip it in water.  Take your ass up.  Oh, man.  Take your ass up and whip your ass and send your home. 
[02:49:30]  With three switches dipped in water.  That had to hurt.  Yo, try it.  Hey, but at least if it wasn't for that kind of discipline,  you wouldn't be where you are now.  Well, it's a microphone.  We need it.  We need it to hear you.  It's not a big black dick.  It's just a microphone.  We need it to hear you, though, because it's a microphone.  Yo, for real.  You touch a child now, you're going to jail.  No doubt about it.  What happened?  You ain't a child now.  If you touch a child now, you're going to go to jail. 
[02:50:00]  You're going to jail.  Yeah, there was a day that you could get away with that, right?  Yo, man.  Let me tell you something, man.  I was born in 11-11, 1961.  Veterans Day.  Man, that motherfucker hit me on the fourth grade.  Never forget it.  I went through that last line, Mr. Lewis.  Yeah, that son of a bitch.  What would you do if you saw him?  I went through the line.  That was my first time with the freelance.  What are the news stories?  You remember the guy, this milk crate, when they had the glass ones? 
[02:50:30]  Yes, the glass milk bottle.  Yo, I took that middle of the motherfucker.  He was sitting over talking to Mrs. Kegel.  And I clapped him and bam.  All right, let's wrap it up with G.I.  What else you got in the paper?  You put a milk bottle over his head.  What else you got?  What else you got in the paper there?  In the newspaper.  Whatever you want me to do.  What's the news?  Anything you want to talk about?  I want to talk about movies.  All right, how about movies?  The new 007 movie's out.  No, man.  You're into Bond?  Yo, what about, what do you call this shit?

I think we should have the listeners decide if we should have G.I. on the homeless shopping spree.  What do you think?  There's going to be 100% yes.  You think?  They like him?  They want the loose cannon.  Call him back, Negro.  Oh, good.  I was hoping you were eating tuna.  He needs one of those dental suction things inside of his mouth. 
[02:52:00]  All the time.  Constantly just...  All right, hey, G.I., can you leave us with a song?  Yeah.  Yeah, you sing a little, man?  Oh, yeah.  I leave you with a song.  He's eating the almonds that have been on the floor for about six months.  Can I leave you with a joke?  Huh?  Can I leave you with a joke?  Yeah, let's hear a joke.  A joke?  What do you think?  What do you think of death and the bathroom haven't come in?  What?  What do you think of death and the bathroom haven't come in?  Death and the bathroom haven't come in.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm going to go flying like meteorites.  We all got to go. 
[02:52:30]  Ah, see?  Leave him on a high note.  Come here, young brother.  He likes Guinness.  Wow, Danny's running.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Hey, G.I., give him a hug.  No.  Give him a hug.  There's a lot of love in this room.  There you go.  Sight.  Oh, he's psyched you out.  Sight you for the fist.  Hey, my cousin.  We all gone.  Nice talking to the studio audience.  It's horrified. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  We'll break in.  Wow, dude.  That guy is far hugged up.  He's out there talking to the guy from Mississippi, Bernie.  One of the cops.  You know, we are the world out there.  God, you guys are really close over there.  I just noticed you in it.  Yeah, me and Billy hate each other.  Yet, when something like this happens, we're brought so close.  It brings us together.  Yeah.  Can you just fucking have, can this all be Lysol?  Yeah, disinfected.  That guy was spitting all over the place. 
[02:53:30]  The spit was flying.  What happened was, Keith.  It's got to be wiped down all over.  Keith, the cop took the disgusting guest seat.  Mm-hmm.  So, that dude actually sat in a convicted felon, Jim Norton's chair.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll break.  Bring in the next retard.  Where's Roland?  Movie reviews.  Oh, boy.  Movie reviews with Roland.  Yeah.  He's around.  Posed down the fucking area.  And bring in Roland.  The art of the homo.  Steve from Foundry.  Also goes by the name Chess Rockwell. 
[02:54:00]  Smooth Lebanese arms.  He's tantalizingly tattooed.  A big books of bear.  Garing at every turn.  That's terrible.  He's sorry.  He may say, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But you'll be saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Chess shaved as smooth as a baby's bottom.  Tantalizing turquoise rings.  Martini steam.  It's moving, Andy. 
[02:54:30]  Ah, nice.  Bill Burr in studio today for Jim Norton.  Playing in the Stress Factory all weekend long.  We got some PS3 updates, Anthony.  PS3 in the news all over the place.  Lots of incidents happening.  The second we heard that they were lining up for these things and saw online, on other lines on the news, we knew there was going to be a problem. 
[02:55:00]  Or two.  Well, one shot in Connecticut PlayStation waiting line.  BB gun.  No.  No, it's the real deal.  Yeah?  Yeah, this happened in Putnam, Connecticut.  Two armed thugs tried to rob a line of people waiting to buy the new PlayStation 3 gaming console early Friday and shot one who refused to give up the money.  I guess these guys are going around thinking, where can we go where there's a large group of people that probably have a lot of cash on them? 
[02:55:30]  Who are nerds and don't know how to fight.  Right.  Yeah, but the PlayStation line.  No, a lot of these people.  They don't look like nerds.  That's what I'm getting.  I would have to say these criminals are pretty damn brave.  I would assume that they're armed just as well.  Maybe.  A lot of the people I see, they're not buying these to play.  They're buying them to sell.  And they're kind of shady.  So they're not credit card people.  So these are probably just cash people. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, so these guys knew there was a lot of cash on them.  You could walk up to the line.  They're $500, $600 a clip.  Yeah.  You rob every one of these people on a line.  You get 20 people on a line or something like that.  You're getting what?  $100, $200.  Could be a couple more than that.  Thank you for going along with the bit.  I forgot Jimmy wasn't here.  He's usually my echo on that one.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm distracted because I'm hearing Yellen and Screamin'.  What's going on out there with GI?  We got a studio audience today, a nice big studio audience. 
[02:56:30]  And we decided to just throw GI in the middle of them.  And now Master Poe is shadowing GI.  And I heard Yellen and Screamin'.  It's instigation.  Is everything all right?  No.  What happened?  Nothing.  The fucking guy can't bother nobody.  He's just hanging.  So where is he?  He wants to go home.  All right.  I'll get him out.  What, outside?  It's just out the door, right?  All right.  GI!  Have him say goodbye, Lee.  Oh, God.  We just sprayed down here.  We just got all the spit out of here. 
[02:57:00]  Like, give him a mic.  No, no, no.  Give him a mic outside.  Oh, my God.  Give him a mic outside.  Mic outside.  Outside, Mike.  Nice.  Or right by the door.  Nice.  No, outside.

[03:01:00]  I don't take it personal.  Why are you going to wipe ass?  I don't take it personal.  You're going to wipe ass?  Nothing here is personal.  Hey, it's all about doing a job.  Should we have Poe show him a move?  I'm coming to you like a man.  Not touch him, but just one of his things.  Yeah, a little exposition.  Sit back, bro.  Hey, Poe.  Get back.  Oh, yeah.  Poe.  I'm going to take it home, right?  What's up, Poe?  You want to take it home with you?  You want to show him?  Maybe you could show him some moves without, like, he could watch, and you could use maybe  Mars or somebody as a subject, and show him some of the moves you got.  And then ask him if he wants a piece of that.  And then ask if he wants to tangle with you.  Right.  Or maybe just some of those martial arts things you do when you're dancing to, like, Beyonce 
[03:01:30]  on YouTube.  Poe, what do you think?  Yeah, I think so.  All right, all right.  Poe is going to set him off.  Just hang out, GI.  Hang out.  Be cool.  Yeah, man.  Go ahead.  Poe is so from the Cobra Kai.  It's not even funny.  Check this shit out.  Yeah, check this shit out.  All right, baby.  You're the man.  All right.  We need Marcelino.  Where are you, Marcelino?  All right.  Watch this.  Come on.  Open the door, Mike.  I can see this shit.  It is now a dojo. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  Man.  Damn, man.  I want to see if we can scare GI at all.  The karate kids.  GI's got a rap, but I want to see if you see some moves.  There's Mars.  It's just Mars.  All right, here we go.  GI, you watch this.  He's not scared.  No, I got that.  My nigga's mad.  I know he's mad.  I know him from uptown.  All right, Poe.  What are you going to do?  All right, here it is.  Here it is.  Okay.  Let's see.  Yo, baby, don't let me touch the horse.  Well, before you were raising your hands to me, okay? 
[03:02:30]  You were waving your hands in front of my face.  Yes.  And I'll show you a simple move that's going to eliminate that immediately.  For real?  Yeah.  Oh, real?  That's right.  You're not with no shoes like that on your feet.  Well, let me tell you something.  These shoes are gone.  What do you mean, you nigga, nigga?  You can never compete.  All right.  Well, we'll see.  First step is that you were raising your hands towards me.  All right, brother.  You were doing this motion.  No, I wasn't.  I was raising your hands like we was in church. 
[03:03:00]  I said, Lord, bless the child that has no home.  You were looking for Jesus?  He's already bagging down.  Bless the child that has no home.  Okay, we're going to go nice.  I got a hard dick and no home.  This is brilliant heckling.  I'm running back.  Yeah, he really is a good heckler.  I'm switching where his hands go.  Raising your hands.  Oh, yeah.  All right, right.  Raising your hands.  All right, that right there?  Down in a second.  All right.  You were raising your hands.  Down in a second.  You were raising your hands.  So now what I would have you is here on the floor, and you, my friend, would be my bitch. 
[03:03:30]  Oh.  No, he didn't.  Oh, damn, he didn't.  No, nigga, let me tell you.  You got to catch me with my heart on, nigga, because I be running like a motherfucking fly  on me.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm from the south, buddy.  I get down and run like no doubt.  You know?  I let the motherfucking balls in the motherfucking stank.  I let a motherfucking raccoon catch you in the corner and bat your ass out, man. 
[03:04:00]  Will you?  Would you?  Did you?  No, not good you.  Not did you.  No, not boo you.  Man, let me tell you something.  Them raccoons catch you in the corner, and they going to do you.  I don't know what that meant.  And?  I think he was losing the crowd.  Yeah, he's losing.  Yeah, he lost him.  Ain't no end.  He's scared.  You can tell.  When a raccoon get done with their ass, motherfucker, ain't no end.  Yeah, that demonstration.  You know, the philosophy is very simple.  The one who talks a lot is in fear. 
[03:04:30]  Yo, you know what?  I might run it.  Free.  Yo, you know what?  My lips might move.  Ain't nothing coming out of the bit.  Because, yo, when my lips start moving, ain't nothing coming out but shit.  I don't see a hook underneath your ass.  You don't see it.  It doesn't seem like you're coming forward.  You better think about them damn shoes, man.  You like them, huh?  Some new laces, motherfucker.  I keep it moving.  They're great shoes, aren't they?  Get some new laces.  That's all you got.  Yo, man.  Yo, we all good.  Yo, man.  Yo, pa.  I respect you.  You're fine.  You're fine.  So, he changes things.  Yo, you got your own.  That was a visual taser he just got. 
[03:05:00]  Not only did he see it, then he had the Schwarzenegger 80s action movie line afterwards.  Yeah.  So, now we're good?  I make you my bitch.  Don't raise your hand.  I'm fine with that, sir.  We talked about raising your hand.  I'm fine with that, sir.  Yeah, but you can't raise your hand towards anyone else.  Don't worry about my knuckle.  I'm fine with that, man.  He went to point and pose. 
[03:05:30]  He went home for that one.  Mistake number two.  He did a little fake out.  He goes to fake him out.  Give him the old fist knuckle touch.  Mistake number two.  Reach him for my foot.  He bent down to grab Poe's foot and stood up.  Yo, I bet you.  He's into the psych game.  Mistake number two.  I don't play baseball, you know.  $2.99.  Yo, man, come on, man.  Don't get me over here and get to fight.  Yo, you're going to tell me how to come over here and fight somebody. 
[03:06:00]  Yo, man, get me out of here, man.  He wants out now.  You were on your ass for a minute.  Yo, you got you.  Yo, you know what?  Yo, I set that shit up.  Yo, you're a punk for that shit.  You don't have to go out like that.  Try that shit with me.  Try that shit with me.  Oh, no.  I take the legs out of your shoes and put them off.  I guess it's all right as long as it doesn't hurt.  Oh, there goes a mic.  Wow. 
[03:06:30]  This guy wants Poe to try that shit on him.  Oh, no.  I take the motherfucking shoes and dominate, my man.  So go ahead.  I'm on the floor.  Yo, take them off.  Put them in there.  Don't worry about it.  They have no fist.  Does anybody else see where this is going?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, Poe's taking the shoes and socks off.  You might have some spray.  Oh, Lord.  Let me get them off.  Poe took his shoes and socks off and the guy's goofing on and his feet stink.  Oh, I need to stop.  Why did he take his shoes off?  They got some fucking feet and that's the door.  Now he's ready for action.  GI is on all fours, Ant. 
[03:07:00]  Help us.  He doesn't like to smell of Poe.  Get my feet and knock them out.  All right.  What are we doing?  GI, what are we doing?  We're sitting down.  I see you.  I'm going to find the closest choice to take my dog.  I made him see God.  I'm going to shut up this dog in here.  He's got some fucked up dogs.  All right.  Yo, give me a half out of here, man.  Give me a half out of here.  Don't be with that big microphone.  You don't want the mic.  I know.  Well, what are you going to do?  Oh, the humanity.  Oh, as the Hindenburg is rising here at Lakehurst, New Jersey. 
[03:07:30]  All right.  I think he's had it.  He's had it.  He wants to go to a church with his dog.  Yeah.  Poe put the fear of Poe in him.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, GI.  I want GI on the homeless shopping spree.  He could be a lot of trouble.  And I definitely want him there.  All good?  Wow, that was good.  He saw that move that Poe did, and his tune changed. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man, there's a hug going on.  All on video, too.  A shug, actually.  Two cameras shoot going on out there.  It was on PalTalk?  No, well, not on PalTalk, but we got two cameras rolling,  so I'm sure edited.  That'll go up on YouTube.  You'll be able to see the whole thing.  Look at the rush for the door.  Oh, yeah, there's the PS3.  On someone's cell phone.  Yeah, we were in the middle of talking about this.  All right, GI, we'll see you for the homeless shopping spree, my brother. 
[03:08:30]  He's out of here.  You know what?  Can somebody hit me?  All right.  He's still complaining about something.  Yeah, well.  They're getting it on camera.  Yeah, so a couple of guys decided they were going to rob the line  because all those guys had money.  And one of the patrons resisted, and that patron was shot.  Is he all right?  He's at the hospital.  No word on his condition. 
[03:09:00]  So they had already robbed a couple of people.  I guess so, yeah.  It's kind of the old go down the line and go, hey, give me your money.  Give me your money.  Give me your money.  One guy says no.  Both suspects believed to be in their teens, wearing ski masks, brandishing a handgun.  The other one had what appeared to be a shotgun.  Yeah, and we have the BB gun shooting that we heard of.  In Kentucky.  In Kentucky.  We talked about the Best Buy in Boston, right? 
[03:09:30]  Best Buy in Boston, yeah, they were aware that they had 140 consoles.  Got smart.  Employees gave out 140 tickets to the first 140 people in line  so everyone else could just go home and get the fuck out of there.  But my favorite, even though it doesn't involve a gunfire.  We got the audio, by the way, of the news story.  But go ahead.  This is great.  In Palmdale, California, authorities shut down a super Walmart  after some shoppers got rowdy late Wednesday.  And then in West Bend, Wisconsin, a 19-year-old man was injured 
[03:10:00]  when he ran into a pole racing with 50 other people  for one of the 10 spots that they had at Walmart.  So running as fast as he could, I bet.  19 years old, working up some speed.  Right into a pole.  Here's the news story.  At the stroke of midnight, excited gamers poured into stores that opened early.  I went up by now four days straight, very tired, losing my voice, and can't wait to get home, please. 
[03:10:30]  Thousands of people have lined up for days to be among the first to own the new PlayStation 3.  How long have you been in line here?  Tuesday morning, it's 10.30.  This was the scene at a Walmart in Wisconsin, where gamers made a mad dash for a chance to buy one of ten PlayStation 3s available at the store.  It sent this man to the hospital with head injuries.  I'm running full out, and next thing I know, I'm in the air, and my face just collides with the pole. 
[03:11:00]  Initially, 400,000 units will be sold in the U.S. to be followed by a steady stream of imports from Japan.  From the look of it, they'll be flying off the shelves.  We'll be able to get them next week.  That's great.  Did you hear the screaming?  Yeah.  And they're like, ah!  Riot.  Right on, man.  All right.  I'm trying to think of something that would be worth that.  That really, why would you?  Nah, I, uh, I don't know.  I've been sitting out there since Tuesday. 
[03:11:30]  Like the idiots who sit out there to watch Star Wars?  Just wait a week.  Nothing.  Wait.  We asked the other day, did you ever wait online for anything?  For days?  No.  More than the usual waiting online at the bank or something.  The dumbest thing I ever did, I sat outside the Laugh Factory from 9 in the morning for a 7 o'clock in the evening sign-up  to do three minutes.  Oh!  Oh, yeah.  Poor fuck.  This was like, this was like-  How long ago was this?  This was like three years into the business when I was like deciding if I was going to move to LA or New York. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, man.  It's like I got sunburned.  I literally went home, showered after I signed up, and then had to-  The funny thing is I got there at 9 in the morning, and I was still like the fourth person in line.  It was insane.  It was the stupidest thing ever.  And I went down there.  I did three minutes.  Somehow, killed.  I could never do it again.  Killed for three minutes.  I don't even know if that's possible.  Yeah, right?  You can't even get up ahead of-  It's like, hey, how's it going?  All right, take it easy.  But somehow I did it.  I'm sitting there going like, this is it.  I'm going to get in there, and this guy's going to think I'm great, and I'll be in here. 
[03:12:30]  And he just ripped my act apart.  And I was like, you know what?  Fuck this.  I'm going to New York.  Good for New York.  Stupidest thing ever.  The second I got to the gene pool of people that I was just sitting there with, it was just freaks.  It's the only people that would wait on line for anything.  Yeah.  For anything.  People don't like waiting on line by nature.  I don't-  If I have to stay on line for anything, motor vehicle, things like that, drives me nuts. 
[03:13:00]  Can't do it.  But to camp out for a PS3?  Oh.  In a lawn chair?  Forget it.  All right.  Well, GI was just terrific.  We should take a break.  It was.  We got homeless Tyra Banks to get into.  We're talking about the homeless today in honor of the homeless shopping spree right around the corner.  Why does she pretend to be homeless?  Yeah.  You say that like it's a joke.  Yeah.  It's a serious expose that she is doing.  She's a journalist.  Yeah.  We'll get into the audio next. 
[03:13:30]  Cash up, niggas.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bubby, hockey, Bubby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, niggas.  We're about to all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is-  Fuck my dick.  I can't give me no money.  V.O.B. and Anthony's show.  XM Radio, cash up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch nigga, stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch.  All right.  Who are you now and the way?  So I guess the channel changes to the virus on Monday. 
[03:14:00]  Who are you?  Monday, is it?  Monday, high voltage goes away.  Thank God.  No more high voltage.  No more Ron and Fez.  Always was a dumb, dumb, dumb name for the channel.  They're going over to the new Clear Channel, whatever the fuck station Clear Channels were putting them on, because they were sold.  Yeah.  So, enemy of the show, Ron and Fez.  How many more times are you going to buy this, assholes? 
[03:14:30]  Homeless time.  Dude, did you hear?  Yeah.  Let me be the first to start the thread.  Let me just-  Oh.  Nice.  I think I'll beat everyone on this one.  Look, me.  Me.  I said it first.  Little, uh, board, uh, rumors?  We're going to-  Let me start the thread.  Razzle dazzle.  My car doesn't work.  Razzle dazzle.  And there's always a second guy that starts the exact same thread and just makes believe it and see that it's already up there. 
[03:15:00]  And then people yell at him.  Dude.  Ass.  They put a link.  Uh, already done.  Mod, please lock.  Try to search it.  Keep out, budinsky.  Yeah.  Try the search.  Well, sometimes you search and there's a thousand fucking threads for what you're looking for.  I had to search the word the.  You fucking sometimes-  I can't find, like, anytime, like, I would, like, I'll be down in the club and I'll hear, oh, did this happen on the show?  And I go to WackBad and I try to find, it says, like, today's show and I go there and it's some 2002 archive and I can't, I can't fucking find it. 
[03:15:30]  It's either that or you go to today's show and there's 23 pages you gotta go through.  You try to search and other things come up from, yeah, 2001.  It's just not worth it.  Pain in the ass.  All right.  In honor of homeless shopping, the homeless shopping spree.  I hate that fucking guy that's singing that.  G.I.'s in.  G.I. in. 
[03:16:00]  For homeless shopping spree.  Andrew.  Andrew in.  Andrew is gonna be the poor fucking defenseless lamb that we lead to slaughter in this thing because he's not one of these powerful homeless take care of himself kind of guys.  For the listeners, you should give Andrew more money than stuff.  Oh, I earned that.  Maybe he could hide the money a little better than a brand new coat or a brand new sneaker.  He was stupid.  He had, like, the cup in his hand.  It was full of cash today.  And then he had the 20 between his finger and the cup. 
[03:16:30]  And that's when G.I. tried grabbing it out of his hand.  Right, right.  Like, sliding it out from there.  Yeah, he's a complete, like, pacifist.  Yeah, he's all passive.  He's gotta take that money, put it inside, like, the fifth coat he's wearing, pocket, so no one's gonna take it.  And then, of course, tippy time.  So we got three really good ones so far.  Stars.  Stars.  Three stars.  We got an all-star team.  Graywolf isn't homeless anymore.  We heard he's not homeless.  Son of a bitch.  Went and got his fucking life in order.  Who did?  Graywolf.  Graywolf. 
[03:17:00]  Bastard.  I don't remember that one.  What business is it of his to get his life, to slap his life together when we need homeless shopping free?  It was like an AA meeting and his, when did you know you bottomed out?  I was a guest on the Opie and Anthony show.  They gave me some money for some shoes.  He's doing good, I hear.  All right.  Yeah, God bless.  Well, you know, Tyra Banks, she's just terrific.  Can't get enough of the Tyra Banks.  She's fantastic.  She is changing the world.  The whole thing, my girl always watches that, that next supermodel, and like whenever she does, her whole like acting style is if it's loud, that means it's good. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are we going to do today, girls?  We're going on the runway!  Jumping up on the desk and just acting like a fucking idiot.  Yeah.  I think I got one of those.  You're going to be runway models, girls!  How about it?  I got one.  Stop yelling.  I got one, Bill.  We got a whole pile of Tyra audio.  We can't get enough of that.  Her resume, she just reads fuckable. 
[03:18:00]  That's it.  She makes everything about herself.  Everything.  It always comes full circle, no matter what she's talking about.  At the end, it's like, we're going to Tyra-fy it.  Are you?  Dude.  Could you do that to cancer?  She had an underwear show the other day where everyone had to be in lingerie in the audience.  Yeah.  But she had to wait to do her big reveal.  Yeah, she had the audience take their clothes off and sit in lingerie.  And it's like, come on, ladies.  I guess it was a freeing type of experience.  And they're all beautiful women and stuff. 
[03:18:30]  And then she has to, you know, take her fucking clothes off and show this model body in Victoria's Secret.  Hilarious.  Like fucking little boy shorts and a Victoria's Secret bra that puts her tits in perfect position.  Just flat belly.  Right.  Just huge, heaving, natural boobs.  All these house frow frumps in the audience that, like, think their neighbors think they're hot are sitting there just all of a sudden, like, covering up.  All their body language are just like, I'm fat.  I'm a pig.  Fuck this.  Tyra just made them all feel like dog shit. 
[03:19:00]  These housewives are sitting on their chairs with just their underwear on.  I feel good.  I can't really call them panties.  When I take my son to school, all the other parents look at me.  And I feel good about, holy shit, look at the body on this one.  Oh, fuck, I'm fat.  Their asses are falling off the sides of the chair now.  And they're starting to hot as shit.  I don't care.  At my age, I look good.  A little cellulite.  And oh, my fucking God, look at her belly.  Then she's trying to talk about all the pockmarks she has on her ass. 
[03:19:30]  She's, like, trying to come up with something that's wrong with her body.  Of course, because it's about her.  It's not them with really horrific bodies.  Look at my imperfections.  And then.  Where?  Then she shows what she's got.  And then for the rest of the show, she's got, like, a bathrobe on.  Well, a Victoria's Secret silk robe on.  While the rest of the audience has to sit there shivering, probably.  Because they always keep those studios freezing in their undies.  What a degrading fucker.  Just lead them to the showers after that. 
[03:20:00]  Leave your clothes in this pile.  You will be kept together when you get to the family camp.  That's not bad enough.  She had, like, a fatty fashion show to end it.  Oh, great.  With fat girls in lingerie.  You look good.  It's about how you feel on the inside.  I can't get enough of it.  Because she's just such a.  It's all about her.  She's got the.  Egotistical.  Egotistical mess.  Dude, it was hilarious.  You just nailed it.  I love her. 
[03:20:30]  She reveals this perfect model body.  Yeah.  Fucking housewives.  To these poor housewives that think they're hot.  You know, the husband brings friends over.  And she notices the husband looks at the wife.  Right.  And see.  Or she goes out to dinner with another couple.  And notices how much better she looks than the couple's wife that is there.  And then she's like, yeah, I'll do this.  Work.  I'll sit here.  And I look good.  Looking around the audience, probably going, I look better than her and her.  And look at that.  Why did she even bother coming?  I'm put together.  And my husband tells me how beautiful. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at her tits.  Look at Tyra's perfect tits.  Look at my saggy.  I fed four kids tits.  At that moment, the whole crowd's just searching to see where their clothes are.  Where their clothes are.  Hope no one stole them.  Right.  Their elbows tuck into their gut.  Their fists come up to their chins.  Crossing their legs.  Crossing their legs.  Bringing that knee up.  Knees up to chest level.  Just trying to make themselves as small as possible.  Fucking Tyra. 
[03:21:30]  You know how they want the camera to pan them and they're looking at the monitor and all  happy when it gets there?  They see themselves and they're like, turn away.  Keep, keep, move along.  Nothing to see here.  Oh, you know what that reminds me of?  You'll see it next week on Thanksgiving.  Whenever the NFL, whenever they have the football at halftime, they show them feeding homeless  people and they always try to pan down to show how happy the homeless people are and  they're all covering their heads.  They don't want to be seen.  Yeah, like, dude, I don't, I've seen that at the soup kitchens and stuff and they're 
[03:22:00]  feeding these on Thanksgiving.  The news does it all the time and they pan down the table and the guys are like, oh boy.  You'll see them, yeah, the forehead and the head, oh boy.  There's some celebrity smiling.  Look, oh no, great eye.  I'm so good.  Look how I'm spending 10 minutes of my Thanksgiving slopping out this gruel for these embarrassed  gentlemen.  You brought back a quick memory.  I was in Rochester recently for Brother Wheeze's big roast and birthday party and stuff and going 
[03:22:30]  down memory lane, you know, when I was in Rochester, I was just a, I was just a promotional  assistant.  I was nobody.  Spuds Buckley, what's that?  Making no money whatsoever and we did the whole like giving toys to the, the underprivileged.  Yeah.  So one of the sales guy, he tells me to load up his, his BMW, his brand new BMW with all  these presents.  And then we had to drive around in the ghetto and, and hand, uh, you know, hand over the  fucking toys through like the window roll down a half an inch. 
[03:23:00]  You're trying to shove a box out.  Dude, this guy had no clue that he had to be pissing people off.  He's just driving up to these houses that have no business like being open anymore.  And, uh, and we're walking up to the door to give him the presents and there's the brand  new BMW at the end of the walkway.  Yeah.  They're like, why don't we just take the host showcase?  That's the present right there.  It's like, take the presents and we'll take the BMW.  You know, bring the, you know, to take the radio station van.  You had to bring your brand new BMW to drive around the ghetto to give people toys, used 
[03:23:30]  toys, by the way.  Oh, used.  Oh yeah.  You know, they love those.  Yeah.  Oh fuck dude.  You're going to make me laugh all weekend with that Tyra thing.  Tyra.  Well, she's helping the world.  Let's go guys.  Let's go.  Oh, oh, I, I forgot.  I, I'm going to take my clothes off too.  Right.  Oh, and then you just hear, oh, a big groan from the audience.  Her perfect ass and tits.  In a perfect fucking, and you know, the makeup people went over her entire body that day. 
[03:24:00]  Of course they did.  She sat there for five hours in a makeup chair like she was having a Jabba the Hutt suit put  on.  It took that long.  Probably didn't eat much the first few days before.  Yeah.  Everybody else.  Did some crunches and fucking pushups before she came out.  The makeup people did it like the second before she came out.  They were putting the last dab on her.  Yeah.  And then she, whoosh, revealed the perfect body.  Just came walking in for a taping.  Like, oh, one woman's got a big zit on her ass cheek, peeking out of her fucking bikini 
[03:24:30]  bottom.  Trying to feel good about her.  Feel good about it.  Do the lace.  With some fucking cheap makeup cover up on it.  Big blotch that's ten shades lighter than her skin.  Some of the girls with back tits.  Oh, it's like chest acne slumped over.  She's just sitting there going, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I just want to have fun and go to the Tyra show.  There it is.  I thought it was going to get humiliated.  No, you'll be compared to Tyra with your C-section scar. 
[03:25:00]  That's good.  No, it's cut right on the bikini line.  And no one will notice.  Oh, fuck.  That's good.  Yeah.  Bikini line if you're wearing a diaper.  Yeah.  Wearing an old 1930s bathing suit.  Yeah.  You ever notice those are the ones that Marilyn Monroe, she had a little pooch.  Oh, a little pooch.  She had a fat ass, big hips, yeah, and a gut.  And she was shaped like Jack Klugman. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Jack Klugman.  Sam.  I wish I could do it with that.  Jimmy's imitation.  Whenever she would sit down on the beach, you know, throwing her head back, she had her  shit pulled up over her navel.  It was over her bunt.  She had a bunt because, yeah, sexy back then were these big bloomer bikini bottoms.  They went like mid-thigh up to your gut.  Yeah.  And, yeah, all her fat was shoved into there.  And there was a roll of fat between the top of the shorts and the bra. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  It was just a roll of fat.  A roll of fat there.  And then she'd be all, all sexy on the beach.  Oh, could you rub some suntan lotion on my birthday?  I'd be happy to do it, Dame.  Boy, she's gorgeous.  Did you look at her gut?  Look at that number.  Yeah, that's a hell of a number.  Look at a set of stems on her.  And a tall drink of water.  Thanks for the setup, by the way.  So here's the title.  Oh, yeah, I forgot we actually have audio.  Tyra Banks and her horrible acting on America's Next Top Model. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, okay.  Habba, habba.  To introduce assignments of taking photos as model stereotypes, here's Tyra Banks acting.  Can't get enough of this broad.  Hello!  Hello!  Where is the photographer?  Who are these young bitches?  I am the only supermodel in the world, and I am almost 35, and I do not like young bitches. 
[03:27:00]  Tyra has completely gone off the deep end or skipped some meds or something.  I am the queen!  I am the queen!  No!  What?  What?  What?  Where is my wind?  Where is my wind?  Where is my wind?  I told you!  This woman needs wind.  Constantly.  Girl, how we blow!  I need the wind!  I need the wind! 
[03:27:30]  You are not looking more like a wind!  Okay, you know what?  I am not returning to the set  until all of these little pre-pubescent bitches are gone.  What is she doing?  Is that her screaming? 
[03:28:00]  Holy shit.  I don't know what this is like, dude.  She's trying to be a diva.  What was that?  You know what's funny?  If you watch it, you can see it in her eyes  that she actually thinks that she's going to get some acting work out of this.  Out of that.  They're going to see her range.  They're going to go like,  Wow, Tyra, I saw your show today.  You did this acting thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It was fantastic.  And that French accent.  Yeah, you do accents.  In and out of.  You showed emotion. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Well, I just wanted to do something in acting.  Oh, the screaming.  What crew member didn't punch her and why?  I don't know.  She was trying to act like a model diva.  Was that it?  And she was falling on the ground and screaming.  Giving like a temper tantrum.  It was awful.  Let's say hi to Dennis in Jersey.  Dennis, what's up?  It was horrid.  It was loud.  You guys are great.  It was loud.  What's the update?  What's the update on Jimmy Norton?  Hey, yeah.  I haven't gotten a call yet. 
[03:29:00]  He got arrested last night and we're still waiting for an update.  That's all we know right now.  It was around the meatpacking district, so you connect the dots.  Connect the dots.  Someone's saying, no, he wasn't caught with Dakota Fanning.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He was caught with like a China type.  Let's just put it that way for now.  A China type?  China.  Where'd you get it?  China dollar.  Oh, big.  I thought you meant Asian.  Not to be a dick, but when you roll the dice that many times, it kind of is inevitable.  Yeah.  He was actually bragging one day, and it was a while ago, so it's not like he jinxed himself 
[03:29:30]  saying anything recently, but it was a while ago.  He said he absolutely knows what he's doing to the point where he could not possibly get  in trouble doing it.  That's like just going, oh, my car's running great.  That's great.  I haven't had any problems with it since I bought it.  The thing's great.  Darts up every time.  I would have, you know.  Obviously, I feel bad for him.  Never been to the doctor, been healthy as a horse my whole life.  Yeah, why are you coughing? 
[03:30:00]  What's that?  I got this lump.  I don't know.  The doctor felt the lump and found a spot somewhere.  I would just love to have heard him stammering.  How many PBA cards and mentions of the O&A show you think flew out of his mouth?  Keep the cop.  Call this number.  This guy.  He's a good boy.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Homeless Tyra Banks.  It's a good tie-in today with the homeless shopping spree.  She wants to be involved in topical matters. 
[03:30:30]  You know, she could have fun doing the diva thing that she did and make everyone laugh with  her acting abilities.  But then she could also get serious and handle the tough issues.  Well, this is what you got to do at home if you're listening to us.  You got to kind of listen very closely and listen how she turns it around and makes it  about her.  Always about her.  Yeah.  I watch just to get pissed off.  I watch as much as humanly possible.  I watch Tyra every afternoon.  I watch that model show. 
[03:31:00]  I'm like, oh, she's doing it again.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Always comes back to her.  Yeah.  It's the fun is trying to figure out how she's going to bring it back to herself.  Absolutely.  She does.  I haven't heard these clips because I did not see this particular show, but homeless  Tyra Banks.  I guess she dresses up as a homeless woman and hits the streets.  Now, how did she do this?  I will bet money somewhere in here.  She's going to say something like, you guys, it was really tough.  It was so hard.  Piano music.  Yeah, we haven't heard this. 
[03:31:30]  It was the middle of August and I spent two hours out there.  I'm thinking at some point, piano music as she gets so serious and talks about, you know,  this is something that people go through.  And until you're put in that ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  I never knew how alone I could feel.  Yeah.  The narration.  That's it.  Yeah.  I never knew how alone I could feel.  These people are castaways of society. 
[03:32:00]  And I shut up.  I would never see like when like they're trying to come up with a new segments for that, that  whole bit and just be like, what other aspects of people's lives suck that I'll never have  to deal with?  God, I want to do that for 20 minutes.  Some people have a terminal disease.  Let's do that.  I want to lay in a hospital bed.  Did you see Entertainment Tonight with Vanessa doing Ugly Vanessa or her version of Ugly Betty?  Uh-uh.  Oh, forget it. 
[03:32:30]  And it must have been her people, her production people, because there had to be a point where  she just wasn't savvy enough to know what adversity was.  So it's like, why don't we do a segment on no 24-hour room service at a hotel?  And they're all like, no.  But I got to keep it good.  Tyra, that's good.  That's a good start because, you know, you're mad.  It's like midnight.  You need a little something and it's not available.  We're going to add a little twist.  A little twist.  You can't afford a hotel room.  You're actually homeless. 
[03:33:00]  What?  What is Humly?  Humly.  Sound it out.  Sound it out, Tyra.  I don't even know what it means.  I can't say it.  All right.  Here's Tyra dramatically introducing this segment.  What other way?  This is the place where the homeless build their tents, live on the streets, and do the  only thing they know how to do.  The narration.  Survive.  Oh, I wish she was raped. 
[03:33:30]  I wanted to experience firsthand the desperation of the homeless.  I wanted to understand what their lives are really like and walk a day in their shoes.  I wish G.I. just shoved a cock in her ass.  Nothing but me.  Oh, you hear that?  What?  Walk a day and then she's like, no makeup, no light.  No makeup, no lighting.  No makeup?  No makeup.  You have to do it the whole place.  They're eating fucking makeup if they find it.  Right.  If they find lipstick, they're like chewing it and eating it. 
[03:34:00]  What a jerk.  I can't imagine being homeless.  Right.  No photographers.  Right.  No red carpet.  That's her way of telling you that she's sacrificing for the homeless.  No makeup.  No makeup.  No shoes.  No gift bags.  Right.  Gift bags.  Listen, listen again.  To understand what their lives are really like and walk a day in their shoes.  No makeup.  No lights.  Nothing but me and the street. 
[03:34:30]  Nothing but me?  But me and the street and a camera crew to keep you safe and food for when you get hungry.  And bodyguards.  Shut up and bodyguards so if G.I. comes up to try to dangle his cock in your mouth, you  don't have to fucking get raped.  What a lying satchel of crap this woman is.  And the assistant to make sure none of the calls are missed.  Yeah, yeah.  The assistant there.  Oh, I have to take this one?  Okay, hold on. 
[03:35:00]  Uh, cut.  Stop the foot.  Yeah.  Next week, Hawaii.  Okay, the beach photo shoot.  Yes, I'll be there, of course.  With the dirty face that no one ever has unless you're playing like a homeless guy on TV or  in the movie.  Yeah, it's like that Halloween makeup hobo.  She's got a stick with a handkerchief.  Yeah, red handkerchief.  Get your boxcar willy.  That's what she's doing.  The stick with the hanky tied to it.  Oh, she needs to stay on TV forever.  Forever.  I can't get enough.  She's in a boxcar.  Where are you off to, son? 
[03:35:30]  Right.  Sharing a ride.  Jimmy Crack Corn.  Her idea of homeless is brand new clothes all ripped up.  There's no dirty.  You know, there's designer.  It's designer ripped up homeless clothing.  Stress.  Stress.  Just distressed.  Yeah.  Distressed fabric.  Yeah.  With a little bit of a tear in it.  I can't step in that puddle.  My feet might get wet.  All right, here we go.  So, so, so far, she says she's going to do it for a day.  Keep that in mind.  For a day.  Tyra continues to emphasize how horrifying the homeless are. 
[03:36:00]  Of course.  The horror of seeing open sores, bleeding feet, men hurled around crack pipes.  It didn't seem real.  It was shocking.  People were shooting up, smoking crack, right there in broad daylight.  Danielle said to me, Tyra, you're seeing it through my eyes, but you have to experience  it for yourself.  Everything was out in the open.  No walls.  I could see everything. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, do I hate this cunt.  I get douche chills.  She's so overacting during the narration.  It is infuriating.  I just like those guys.  It's like a prison shower.  Those guys echoing.  They're somehow fucking outside.  Yeah.  But they have like that cavernous echo.  Oh, is that awful.  All right, moving on.  Tyra and her former homeless escort beg for change. 
[03:37:00]  Is that her?  This is how she dressed.  She looks like a supermodel.  That's hysterical.  Like a do-rag on her head.  She's on set for the color purple, too.  Yeah.  That is absolutely what she looks like.  Silly.  Yeah, silly.  See, she refuses to ugly herself up even for a day on the streets as a homeless woman.  Her skin is flawless.  Dude, it is fucking flawless. 
[03:37:30]  She doesn't have eye makeup on.  She's got to wear some kind of a rag over her head to cover up her hair.  But her skin and lips and everything, flawless.  Yeah.  Anyway.  There is a tiny little rip in her shirt on her shoulder.  Look at that.  The flannel.  Because they all got flannels.  A hooded sweatshirt.  She's got that dramatic look in her eye.  I wish she went all out and just started taking craps on this tree.  Yeah, take a dump.  Shoot up for a day. 
[03:38:00]  Cut her face up a little bit.  Yeah, that's a good question.  When you had to go to the bathroom, where'd you go?  The trailer.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  All right, Tyra and her former homeless escort.  Yeah, was she pissing behind a dumpster somewhere?  Yeah.  No.  Who I'm sure she hasn't talked to since she did this show, by the way.  Who?  Oh, tell her I'm busy.  That's how I'm busy.  I do a show.  Oh, it was a segment.  Yeah, I guess I mean it looked like we were going to be friends for a while, but I'll just  get rid of her.  These are the people that actually thought Tyra cared. 
[03:38:30]  I'm doing a segment on people that thought I gave a shit about them.  I wanted to experience firsthand the rage that they had towards me.  Towards me, Tyra.  Right.  So I am actually going against myself.  Right.  Tyra versus Tyra.  I realized what an asshole I am, and it infuriated me.  I saw me through my eyes, and I suck. 
[03:39:00]  I will never forget these people.  Yeah, until they call again.  I was cast aside by myself.  For 24 hours, I lived as me.  All right, here we go.  Tyra and her former homeless escort beg for change.  How long does it take to make enough money to get some peace?  We're hungry.  Can we have some change, sir?  Can we have some change?  I feel kind of weird right now. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  Excuse me, sir?  Do you think you have any change?  Oh, man, thank you so much.  God bless you.  God bless you, too.  Thank you, man.  After an hour, someone finally gave me a dollar.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  And in the end, I had $3.50.  See, I have a lot of Guinness for me.  That's a million dollars.  That's a million bucks.  Yeah, it is.  God, all she had to do was show her ass.  She would have got a thousand.  Oh, please, I know.  Show your tits. 
[03:40:00]  Why work so hard, you bitch?  Oh, my God.  $3.50, which is like a million bucks.  Yeah.  That's good in homeless exchange money.  I'd never see that in the financial section of the paper.  Homeless exchange dollars, apparently $3.50, is worth a million American.  That's something.  Wow.  I don't know.  I really think I could do better.  Yeah.  I could absolutely do better than that.  I think they're exaggerating.  I mean, do you stand down there at Penn Station? 
[03:40:30]  You get a quarter every couple of minutes.  What does that add up to?  And she's attractive.  It's not like she's, you know, she said she ugly'd herself up.  But it's like, first of all, I bet the money, she didn't take money from all the people that went,  Hey, it's Tyra Banks.  Yeah, all right.  Move on, please.  On the way, Tyra's experiences what it's like to sleep on the street without actually staying overnight.  How do you think, how do you, how do you, how do you, also on the way, also on the way, Tyra's feet hurt, then she finds food in a dumpster. 
[03:41:00]  Could you please tell me the last track is Tyra gets tasered?  I was just going to say that.  Because I would love to just hear, but first, it's this, Tyra reacts very emotionally to her experience so far.  Of course.  She's been on the street probably an hour.  And here's where I think maybe the piano music has to come in.  Come on, please.  When I was walking through the streets, I wasn't just seeing homeless people anymore. 
[03:41:30]  Thank you.  I was seeing stories.  And that all of these people have a story as to why they got there.  And it was hard for me sitting there doing the panhandling and being ignored like that because I'm that person that ignores those people that are asking for money.  Oh.  This was just a glimpse of what homeless people have to go through every day.  I was heartbroken.  It would be nice if you guys could just leave or spend me a long time. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, did you hear that?  I was heartbroken.  What did she say?  I think she's about to tell the camera guy and the crew, you've got to leave me alone and give me some time to myself.  Oh, is that how she got to go to the bathroom and eat?  Wait, here we got Sam.  Yeah, that confession was in like a gas station bathroom and she gets so emotional as she's wiping away her tears.  She has to ask the camera crew to leave her alone for a few minutes.  That, by the way, is absolutely how they cut it so she can then eat and go to the bathroom and do everything else.  It's like, okay.  All right, get me out of this. 
[03:42:30]  And we're clear.  All right.  Craft services are set up.  Get me out of these rags.  Get me beautiful again.  Pretty me up.  I got a meeting.  They're on a leftover set from Oz.  Bathroom.  He got raped.  They just have her in there.  I don't think there's enough graffiti.  Could there be more graffiti?  Does this look real?  Oh.  That's great.  All right.  Listen, listen, listen.  Homeless people have to go through every day.  Every day?  I was heartbroken.  It would be nice if you guys could just leave for a second. 
[03:43:00]  Just give me a little time.  Like we could just go.  I was about to lose it because I was like, how can we be so blind to these people who live like this every day?  Oh, God.  She is the phoniest fuck.  Oh, God.  The acting, the phony sincerity that she cares.  You want a good clip for YouTube?  Follow her around.  She's got to be out there somewhere.  I got to say that.  She's in L.A., right, unfortunately?  And just follow her around with a video camera until she passes that first homeless person. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  And doesn't even acknowledge.  Because this TV show is long gone.  She'll be on her little phone.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All beautiful.  Homeless guy.  Excuse me.  Could I?  Her people will just like shove him out of the way.  Someone is suggesting that she should have hung out with Lady Di sucking hobo cock.  Sucking hobo cock for some cash.  That's a special episode of Tyra. 
[03:44:00]  It's Johnny from Kansas.  I made $640,000.  In one hour?  In one hour.  As Lady Di got a ring ding.  Tyra, all right.  In this next clip, Tyra's feet hurt.  Then she finds food in the dumpster.  Because they're huge.  Just carrying the weight of their own mass around.  Our own Sam saw the video.  So, Sam, what do you see in the video that we're not going to see here? 
[03:44:30]  It's just her.  It's a montage of her walking.  Lady Di montage.  Montage.  Thank you.  How did you do Iraq's part for him?  I looked out at Iraq to see if he did it.  He's laughing.  He did it.  Yeah, of course he did.  As she says in the clip, it's more than she's ever walked in her life.  How long was it, really?  It couldn't have been that long.  I don't know.  But, I mean, going back to the change thing as well, as far as her making $350,000, that  was all before lunch.  Oh, really?  She went out there all day and made $350,000.  She made a dollar an hour. 
[03:45:00]  It's all of her day.  So, how long I work.  I put in overtime.  I work two hours.  Someone, you know, Frank from Manhattan.  We haven't heard from Frank in a while.  I remember you, Frank.  ONA, how sheltered is Tyra that she is just now discovering there are homeless people?  Yeah.  My heart broke as I saw how these people live.  You find out at such an early age that they are homeless and they live like shit.  And how many people have already done this segment with somebody they live up?  Yeah, I saw somebody like Barbara Walters or somebody. 
[03:45:30]  Years ago.  20 years ago.  Like Roseanne Scotto or one of those.  I'm talking years ago in New York.  Walter Cronkite was the first.  Bob, can you please spare a dime?  I'd like a dime.  Anything, please?  I hate to announce this, but the man on the dime is dead.  See, it's a Kennedy crying joke.  No, nothing.  A little more history, people. 
[03:46:00]  All right.  Tyra's feet hurt.  Then she...  My feet are killing me.  And then she finds food in a dumpster.  What are we going to see here?  First, a montage.  The montage is killing me.  Oh, the montage.  Montay!  With the sounds of the homeless.  And then she's standing outside of a dumpster, just dreaming of the day that she might actually  have to eat out of there.  Wait, wait, why?  Oh, would I love to just headfirst throw her into it and make her eat out of it. 
[03:46:30]  When is Tyra Bang...  What is she, a boxer?  She's going to lose her fucking fortune?  She's about two yards away from it, kind of pointing over to it and kind of just saying,  Oh, it stinks in there.  They should have just had her on the show wearing that outfit and then like the picture  over her shoulder of a dumpster.  Yeah.  Like a news report.  I've heard they actually eat out of these things that are over my shoulder.  Dumpsters, I think they're called. 
[03:47:00]  I mean, the name alone just sounds icky.  All right, here's the clip.  My feet started to hurt like they have never hurt before.  And I only had a few cookies to eat that day, so I was feeling really physically and emotionally  weak.  While we're walking, we passed a trash bin full of food.  And at that moment, I knew that if I was truly homeless, I would have eaten that food  out of that bin.  That would have been my lunch.  Maybe my dinner. 
[03:47:30]  Maybe my breakfast too.  It's lunchtime and it's just like snack, brunch.  Basically, it's a favor for people to be dating, you know, all kinds of food out right now.  This, this.  Yes, this.  So what?  It's hard to hear.  Yeah.  She's kind of, her homeless escort is explaining to her that the dumpster is where she might  have to eat out of.  Yeah.  And Tyrus is pointing at the dumpster going, that is breakfast, lunch, dinner.  And at that point, she goes, turn off the camera and then goes, all right, hey, let's  go to Nobu for lunch.  Yeah.  We'll, uh, we'll continue after lunch. 
[03:48:00]  You dine at dumpsters.  I'm going to one of the, uh, classier joints.  Yeah, you dine, yeah, you dine at little dumpster and I'll be at Nobu.  Like, why did she say to breakfast, lunch, even dinner?  Like, between lunch and dinner, you're going to get that IBM job.  Of course you're fucking eating at the dumpster.  If you ate lunch there, chances are you're eating dinner there.  She doesn't understand the concept of homelessness where you can't just step out of it. 
[03:48:30]  What a tool.  This next clip is the showstopper.  What is it?  Tyra experiences what it's like to sleep on the street without actually staying overnight.  Of course she didn't.  What is this about?  Her voiceover is pretty good for this one.  I love the voiceovers.  I guess she's experiencing what it's like to lay down on cement.  So I had them pull up the rug in my dressing room.  Oh my God, are you kidding?  No, she, uh, she specifically says that she's not sleeping there. 
[03:49:00]  Danielle said that around this time we should lay down and make our bed.  So I would go to bed and then stay awake and watch.  You would stay awake and watch, like to protect me?  Yes.  And then we switch turns.  And I knew I wasn't going to spend the night there, but I wanted to feel the terror of actually  laying on the hard cement out in the open and exposed and calling it my day.  So I figured I'd keep your face.  Okay, to cover the face? 
[03:49:30]  Yes, yeah.  Totally get my day.  Oh, a face cover to protect yourself so they don't know if it's like a woman sitting there.  Wow.  Now it was Danielle's turn to rest and for us to switch places.  I was Danielle's keeper.  I was her watch.  I was her only safety.  I understood at that moment that there's no way to really, truly comprehend this.  Because the homeless live like this every single day.  But you know what?  It's not a living. 
[03:50:00]  I'm not watching out for anybody.  It's surviving.  It's just existing.  Tyra, you fall asleep on watch one more fucking time.  I guarantee you a trip out of the bush in a body bag.  I shit you not.  She basically, she had a time in there where she, four sentences in a row began with I.  I.  I.  I.  I am her keeper.  I am her safer.  I couldn't realize.  I was saving this woman.  I'm her keeper. 
[03:50:30]  What's going to happen if someone comes up and goes, first, first of all, I don't think,  I don't think Tyra is watching out for anybody.  I think if somebody walks up and looks at the sleeping homeless person and Tyra, there's  fucking Tyra in the mouth.  It's not, it's, she could be awake, asleep, fucking, it doesn't matter.  Tyra's getting fucked.  I wanted to experience for the first time what it was like to not have a limb.  So you're saying it right now, if I didn't have a limb, I couldn't be drinking this cup 
[03:51:00]  of cocoa.  This wouldn't be possible.  I couldn't believe that I wouldn't be able to bring the glass up.  Then came the real horror when they tied my hand behind my back.  It was as if I truly was an amputee.  Can you turn the cameras off?  Give me a moment.  Give me a moment.  And cut.  Could you untie this fucking thing?  I said not to tie it so fucking tight.  It's hurting me.  I have a shoot later on.  Look what you did to my wrist.  That's a lick of shirt.  Tell the slot machine to go away. 
[03:51:30]  I have to eat.  Can't watch her.  Hey, we have time for one more.  Tyra cries on her show.  We just collect Tyra Banks close, Bill.  Who wouldn't, why doesn't everybody.  On a future show, we go with obese teenagers on Tyra.  Nice.  You know what she is?  She's the new, who's that girl we used to make fun of?  Body still never, ever have.  Tyra Reed.  Tyra Reed.  She's the new Tyra Reed.  Just old.  Comedy girl.  Oh, it's a fat kid.  She tries to say how there was a time she didn't have this body and she had this wrong 
[03:52:00]  with it and this wrong with it.  Yeah.  And she points out maybe.  Tyra, you're saying when I grow up, I could probably have a model body.  Right.  And then Tyra offers top model contestants guidance, a.k.a. tries to get them to cry.  That's great audio, too, for another day.  Who doesn't love hating this woman?  But this is great because NBA player Doug Christie's wife says she was upset. 
[03:52:30]  Bryant Gumbel implied she had no life.  All right.  Married to a big NBA star.  Oh, do you guys know the whole background on this?  Ooh.  No, I really don't.  Enlighten us.  I don't think he's still in the NBA, but Paul Christie, like.  Doug.  Doug?  Doug's not in the NBA anymore?  Doug Christie.  That's right.  I used to know a comedian, Paul Christie.  Doug Christie.  Yeah, he was married to this woman, and she was so in tune to how girls obviously wanted  to fuck her husband.  She used to literally chase him away.  When he was on the team bus, she used to follow the team bus behind in a car, and he had to 
[03:53:00]  talk to her the whole time on the cell phone.  Holy shit, really?  She had him on fucking lockdown.  Wow.  Probably with good reason.  Those basketball players are just a bunch of who is.  Yeah, it's one of those double standards things, because if a guy ever did that to a girl  and was showing an expose on it, it would have been just like.  He's a crazy man.  Yeah.  Stalker.  Exactly.  This guy was so mentally fucked.  You know those guys must have been whispering, hang up on that bitch.  Just hang up.  Just hang up.  Instead of fucking getting their dick stuck. 
[03:53:30]  Everyone on the bus is getting their dick stuck, but him.  He's on the phone.  Yes, Poopsie, still here.  Still here.  Wife right behind the bus?  Both hands are up.  I'm wiggling them.  You can see they're my hands.  Right.  Every time he took like a foul shot, he had to do some sort of gesture that meant I love  you to her.  Holy fuckaroni.  Or he would like shoot like a.  You know?  He'd put something in, you know, he'd make a basket, and he'd always have to put his  hand up that he was thinking about her.  Wow.  What's this about, Sam?  Yeah, they were talking about it on the show, because Tyra's topic was basketball players' 
[03:54:00]  wives, and it was primarily around those two.  And yeah, he had a hand signal that he put up.  I guess the press eventually caught on, but he was doing it, trying to do it without the  press knowing that.  I think it was like a peace sign or something similar to that, that every time he.  Like peace, bitch, please.  Leave me alone.  Yeah, give me some peace.  Right.  This guy redefined pussy whipped.  Wow.  Yeah, that is the ultimate pussy whipped.  Well, see, now Doug Christie's wife has a very interesting story, and she's on Tyra. 
[03:54:30]  She's crying, so then all of a sudden, Tyra cries.  Of course she does.  And starts crying over her NBA ex-boyfriend.  To make it over, to make it about her.  Chris Webber.  Yeah, Chris Webber.  But it wasn't about her.  No.  Doug Christie's wife is pouring her heart out, crying, and Tyra considers this a good opportunity.  By the way, why was she crying?  Like, what was the big issue?  Because Bryant Gumbel implies she had no life.  Oh. 
[03:55:00]  I guess her whole life was just pretty much following Doug Christie around.  And telling him what to do.  Right.  So listen to this.  Listen to how she just turns it around.  It brings fear to my eyes.  Yeah.  It was wrong.  It's hurtful.  It was hurtful.  You're getting the tears right now.  I am so upset with him.  That's the only interview that's ever bothered.  That it got underneath your skin.  What about it was so upsetting?  Just the hurtful stuff that my daughter has to read.  She tried.  She's like, oh, this is hurtful.  What was hurtful?  Go ahead.  I see you're starting to cry. 
[03:55:30]  I want you to cry.  So far, so good.  Like, Tyra's showing some concern here.  All of a sudden, it's like, whoa, hey, what about me?  We were talking about me here.  Come on.  What about it was so upsetting?  Just the hurtful stuff that my daughter has to read.  It's okay.  It's your human.  And you know what?  I think it's really good to see Jackie Christie, this woman that everyone thinks is so strong  and is this bulldog and is the bully to see that she's a human being and she has emotions  and she's a real person.  I think it's okay.  Absolutely. 
[03:56:00]  That was so great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know what I want to tell you?  Like, I was with my boyfriend for a long time.  No, I'm crying.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.  Someone else got the spotlight, God forbid, for a couple minutes.  And she took it away.  She snatched that away.  Listen to this.  She's crying now talking about her boyfriend.  No, I'm crying.  I'm crying.  And I loved him very much, but I couldn't stay because of what this whole show is about. 
[03:56:30]  No, I'm serious.  What this whole show is about.  But I know personally, he loved you, Tyra.  When you weren't there, what did he tell us about?  He said it.  Now she's making her feel good.  Now she has to make her feel good.  Oh my God.  Now she's got to fucking make her, she was just crying about, unbelievable.  She should have like a, like a veteran of the Vietnam War come on, start crying about  his experiences and then she'll start crying and be like, what's the matter?  One time, remember the first time I saw a platoon?  I was just so upset and pain and agony that they went through and this is, and he's just, 
[03:57:00]  oh, it's okay, sweet.  I know.  I understand.  Being in country was pretty rough and, look, I understand.  God forbid I tell the story about the guy I was next to and his head got blown off right  in front of me.  I understand a good cry because the movie is realistic.  The guy I was on the date with made me pay for my ticket too.  Oh, oh, that's terrible, Tyra.  I'm so sorry.  Sorry.  So sorry. 
[03:57:30]  Can I get back to the story about when I stepped on a bouncing Betty and lost my testicles?  Tentacles.  I stink.  Yeah.  That story is just as good as me, you know, bending down and picking up what remained  of my buddy, his five fingers so they had something to bury.  My best friend, uh, yeah.  Just fucking, Jesus.  That reminds me of a time I had to read five times for one part.  Yeah, come here.  Come here.  I see you welling up.  Come here.  Let me rest your head on my shoulder.  Oh, no, the other one.  This one is fake.  It was blown off in Da Nang. 
[03:58:00]  And I was going to tell you about it, but, well, you've got your shoulder crying.  Okay, now I'm crying because my last boyfriend was so fake and I thought he was being real  with me.  I just sometimes.  And I realize I have fake parts because they were blown off in the war.  Yeah, yeah.  That's just like telling the story of eating my buddy's foot to stay alive in the jungle because  I knew I wouldn't be found for a week.  Okay, now I'm crying again because I just got some Jimmy Choo shoes and they don't fit  and they hurt my toes.  Let it all out, sweetheart.  Let it all out. 
[03:58:30]  Well, why don't you try this one on, precise sister?  Big wooden foot.  Let it all out.  It's just like the time I was cradling my friend's head as he had a sucking chest wound  and died in my arms.  It's wonderful.  Okay, okay.  You're getting me upset again because I've always been self-conscious about my chest because  my boobs are so big.  Guys, I always want to suck on my chest.  See him sucking chest wound. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, God.  She is magic.  It's still 30 seconds left.  I backed it up.  Oh, thank God.  So Doug Christie's wife crying here.  You're making a point.  She winds up having to fucking console Tyra Banks.  Listen, so the voice you hear is now Doug Christie's wife consoling Tyra.  Who gets that point again here?  I backed up.  For a long time.  No, I'm crying.  No, I'm crying.  And I loved him very much, but I couldn't say because of what this whole show is about. 
[03:59:30]  No, I'm serious.  What this whole show is about.  But I know personally, he loved you, Tyra.  When you weren't there, what did he tell us, Tyra?  He said it.  Don't cry.  What did he tell us?  He prayed to Tyra.  I remember giving you a butterfly purse, and his eyes lit up, and he goes, that's my girl,  and she loves butterflies, and we thought you'd be his wife, and we still think so.  So we're praying for you guys.  Well, that's not going to happen, but maybe we're going to beat him up because he loved you.  God, I didn't even notice that Doug Christie was on the couch, too, because all of a sudden 
[04:00:00]  she goes, tell her, Doug.  Tell her, Doug.  Yes, yes.  I'm still pussy whip.  Yes.  He's just agreeing the whole show and talking about what a support she'd always been.  Oh, my God.  Wouldn't it have been great if he just looked her lovingly in the eyes and punched her  as hard as he could right in her face?  Right in her fucking face.  Bam.  There you go, Tyra.  Look what I did to her.  I knocked her the fuck out.  Now I'm going to go and get all those BJs I missed. 
[04:00:30]  God, should we do more?  There's just so much.  I love the Tyra.  I love the...  A little more Tyra.  Give me a new subject, quick.  I got to hear a little more.  Yeah, all right.  I wouldn't care if I fucking had shit to do right now.  I got to hear more of this.  Should we go with the...  She's magic.  We should go fat teenagers instead of the model advice.  Yeah, let's hear fat teenagers.  All right.  What has she got to say to fucking fat teenagers?  All right.  We haven't gone late in a while anyway, so...  All right.  Obese teenagers on Tyra. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, this self-centered twat.  God, what time is this drivel on?  And why do I miss it?  I DVR it.  I don't know.  Do you?  Dude, every day.  Every fucking day.  I don't miss.  Baby, DVR Tyra.  Every day.  Please.  Because I got to see that.  I play all sorts of games with the show.  I just wait for her to turn it around.  Oh, wait.  I addressed her on the air.  So I go, love you, schnookums.  I got to make a sign. 
[04:01:30]  There we go.  All right.  Here we go.  Tyra asks the kids what their favorite foods are, then asks one girl if she has tried dieting.  What type of foods do you like?  I like steak and ice cream a lot.  Steak and ice cream?  And I hear that you'll eat a salad, but what do you always have to put in that salad?  Steak and ice cream.  I've got to put something in that salad.  I don't blame you on that one.  Okay.  What about you, Molly?  What are your foods?  Ice cream, chips, cookies, you know, sweets, really. 
[04:02:00]  And have you ever tried dieting?  I try dieting, but, you know, I try it for a little while, and if I don't see any good results, then I just feel like giving up.  In five minutes.  You've tried Atkins, Weight Watchers, Diet Shakes, and you...  How long do you go on it before you stop?  Um, I give it two weeks, and then when it doesn't work, it's just like, okay, it's not working, and it's not ever going to work.  All right.  You know, we've got to spend a little time with the setup, trust me, because I'm looking ahead here, and one of the clubs we're going to play is 227-pound, 12-year-old Dakota cries after talking about being made fun of. 
[04:02:30]  Tyra tries to relate.  Stop it!  Oh, my God.  All right, let's try this clip here.  Cassandra, what about you?  What are your favorite food choices?  Because, um, I don't know, I like to eat out a lot, or I do eat out a lot, and when I go and eat out, I don't eat, like, healthy foods. 
[04:03:00]  Like, I like to eat chicken a lot, but, you know, I don't want the grilled chicken sandwich to taste nasty.  I don't want, you know, the fried chicken sandwich.  You want the fried chicken sandwich, not the grilled chicken sandwich.  Okay.  I hear a lot of people in the audience are going, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  And somebody doesn't like vegetables.  I don't like vegetables.  I don't like salad.  I don't like salad dressing.  I don't like any of it.  You don't want any of that.  Can I have a burger? 
[04:03:30]  My producer's actually about vegetables.  You said, yuck.  I was like, what?  What's that?  What is that?  All right, so.  I don't like vegetables.  All right, getting to know the fatties there.  So here's the clip, the 227-pound, 12-year-old Dakota.  And Dakota, what's the worst thing?  Because I know kids can be so cruel at school.  What's the worst thing that you think has happened to you?  The color north and south.  Well, there's a lot of things that's happened.  But in particular, this one girl in my class, one day we were just there, and she came up 
[04:04:00]  to me, and she had a pen, and she poked my chest, and she said she was going to make  all the milk come out.  She poked you in your chest and said that to you?  I said what?  She's going to make all the milk come out?  She's a cow.  Holy shit, what the fuck is that?  Izzy has a breast.  Goddamn.  What grade was this in?  I think he's 12, so...  Oh, it's a he.  Oh, it's a he.  Oh, okay.  Now it's funny.  That's a boy.  All right.  That's a funny joke.  Yeah, but it's a sixth-grade hack.  Yeah.  He's a hack.  He's a prop act with a pin.  He's a hack. 
[04:04:30]  The fucking little fucking Gallagher.  Sixth-grader.  Everybody's a hack in the sixth-grade.  That's true.  We're going to make all the milk come out.  She poked you in your chest and said that to you?  Here comes Tyra.  Oh, Dakota.  I hope she's watching this and she can see how much that hurts you, because that hurts  me, too, to hear that and to hear how much it hurts you.  I don't think she knows.  I think kids can be so cruel, and I was one of those cruel kids, and I was also a kid that 
[04:05:00]  was attacked, too, on both sides.  So I know what it feels like on both sides.  Cover all the bases.  Just in case she does a show on bullies, she can then relate to them.  But no, this one.  You know, I did both.  I actually bullied myself.  Jesus Christ.  What a psychopath.  Imagine trying to, like, go after Tyra in sixth grade.  What could you find wrong with her?  Stop.  She was probably always tall, thin, and gorgeous. 
[04:05:30]  She had boobs in the third grade.  Connie, I know that your daughter, she really struggles, too.  So why don't you talk about what that does to you as a mom?  Oh, it tears me up.  It's very emotional.  Mom is fat.  Now mom's crying.  She hurts every day.  I hurt every day.  Yeah.  But we try.  When you dislodge your jaw.  I know that you say it's a never-ending battle, and you feel like you've already lost. 
[04:06:00]  It's got to hurt.  She can't go to school.  The kids make fun of her so bad.  She can't ride the bus.  She is the bus.  It tried once, but it did a wheelie.  Oh, my God.  You just had to buy a flip-flip truck. 
[04:06:30]  I can't do this without food.  Not the greatest Tyra Clips, to be honest, but it's definitely so good.  The other people are actually shining here.  Yeah.  Because, you know something?  She is really finding it difficult to turn this around to her.  She's trying.  She's thinking, God, there was one time.  I've always been beautiful, and I know I have been.  Before the Victoria's Secret shoot, I was five pounds overweight.  It took me so long to get that five pounds up.  I wasn't 200 pounds, but I felt like I was. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  And in my business, if you're five pounds overweight, you might as well be 500 pounds.  Right.  You might as well be 500 pounds.  Yeah.  It's all relative.  It really is.  Well, we've got to play it out.  I don't know if we're going to get some good Tyra.  That's all right.  We've got a couple more here.  And Gene, I know that you're really strict when it comes to Abel's food.  15-year-old's mom.  In fact, backstage, we have a green room.  And in our green room, we try to take care of the guests here, and we put a lot of food 
[04:07:30]  and a lot of snacks.  But what did you do?  Good job.  With that food?  Ate it.  Took out some of the junk food off the tray.  Got it out of the room.  You told our producers, get this out of here.  Just get it out of there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's talking about you, Tyra.  I know that you put locks on the, um...  You know why she did that, by the way?  There were snacks in the green room, didn't it?  Yeah.  This mom that's talking to her son, I think it's her son, uh, 400 pounds.  Yeah.  There shouldn't have been fucking snacks in the green room.  You know who your guests are that day.  And you know what they did? 
[04:08:00]  They had probably hidden cameras.  Yeah.  She said, look what we saw in the green room.  We put these snacks in the green room.  I can't believe you would actually eat those cookies.  Yeah.  Now, why did you eat the...  Right.  I think it sounded like a hostage situation when they're just talking about the food.  I said, get that out of there.  Get that stuff out of here.  Get it out of there.  Get those cups out of here.  Move them back.  What a douche.  She was hoping that the kid would start snacking.  Of course she was.  And then show the video.  I think she could start crying because she knows what it feels like to want to eat a cookie.  Do you want to eat? 
[04:08:30]  Get this out of here.  Just get it out of there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know that you put locks on the refrigerator.  Some really, really serious things to try to get him to stop.  I did that.  But then I also have people in the family that are underweight.  So I didn't want to torture them.  So we decided a good balance.  Doctors told him, you know what?  You're responsible for what you're doing in your mouth.  But also I'm responsible for what I bring in there.  So when I cook, I give him what I call a regular portion. 
[04:09:00]  If he wants anything extra besides water, he's got to ask me.  He's got to ask me.  If I catch him over.  Why is it in the house at all?  Wait, wait.  But she said.  His weight's coming off slowly, slowly, slowly.  She said they have one person who's overweight.  Then there's people underweight.  So they barely have enough money to pay for food for everybody.  And this fat fuck is eating all of it.  Eating everything.  And now there's people starving in their house.  But it's also what she's bringing in.  She's obviously bringing in stuff.  That he shouldn't be eating. 
[04:09:30]  Yeah.  Chicken fried steak.  Yeah.  But would I give him a small portion?  If he wants more, he's got to ask me.  And then I give it to him.  But I figure the calories he burned when it took to ask me makes it a little bit better.  I understand.  We try.  We're trying.  All right.  Two more clips.  Two quickies here.  Tell me about the doctor when you went, the last time you went to the doctor to get weighed.  I couldn't get weighed on the scale. 
[04:10:00]  So he told me to.  Why couldn't you get weighed on the scale?  Because the scale was, it stopped at a certain size.  And I was over that size.  So that's why I couldn't get weighed on the scale.  He took me to the vet.  So how did he weigh you?  Do you know how he weighed you?  He didn't weigh me.  He just had to guess?  Yeah.  So you really don't know exactly how much he weighed.  He drew a picture of a rhino on her chart. 
[04:10:30]  Well, Shiana can't walk or breathe and sweats a lot because she eats terrible foods.  It's like the first two weren't bad enough.  Can't walk or breathe and sweats a lot.  And sweats a lot.  That is the trifecta.  Fucked a deer on the side of the road.  You watch Biggest Loser?  I've seen all those things a couple of times.  Yeah.  It's like you watch a couple of times and then just meh.  In the end, is that the one in the end where they have like.  It's pretty amazing actually.  They're on the. 
[04:11:00]  Is it the scale with Ant or is that another one?  They showed a guy that got kicked off, Marty.  He got kicked off.  So what they do.  Bless you, Tham.  Is they now show him what he looks like today.  Because the show was taped a while ago.  And he got kicked off after losing 92 pounds.  They show him now.  He's up to losing 140 pounds.  And he's now ripped.  And he started as a fat guy in the show.  Really?  Not like.  So he must have had the operation then to.  No.  To get the loose skin.  Oh.  Oh. 
[04:11:30]  I don't know.  He didn't have his shirt off.  But he was ripped.  Wow.  Bizarre.  Go for him.  It's the.  I don't know.  I kind of enjoy that show actually.  Man, I watched that one.  You know what's wrong with that, Opie?  It was inspirational and there's no way to trash it.  Yeah.  That's why it just laid there.  You actually brought up something nice.  There's really no way to just totally rip into the guy.  So now what we have to do is make fun of Opie for bringing that.  Weren't you hoping that when he said they went back to him and he had gained twice as 
[04:12:00]  much back?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like I was hoping for that.  Yeah, that's what I was going for.  And then I was going to give it to you.  Fucking guy.  Why can't he have some self-control?  The greatest part of the show, and I can't believe no one has really talked about this  in the media, Carolyn raised a host.  And as these people lose weight week after week, they're losing.  One guy lost 20 pounds last week.  They lose 10, 12, 8, 15.  It's just crazy numbers, right?  Uh-huh.  Week to week.  Carolyn Ray is the same size and getting fatter.  She's getting fatter?  She's the host of The Biggest Loser. 
[04:12:30]  It's like the visual version of a picture of Dorian Gray.  Right.  Like the people on the show get thinner, and their fat goes on to her.  It's like Dean Martin hosting an AA meeting.  Right.  There's the joke.  Thank you, Bill Burr.  Stress factory all weekend long.  I'll be there tonight.  Silly me.  I use a fucking reference out of a novel.  See?  Books.  Do nothing but get you in trouble.  Dean Martin's out there crooning. 
[04:13:00]  Who do we have up next?  Blah, blah, blah.  Well, how much did you have to drink here, young lady?  He's wearing a tux.  Here we go.  Shiana can't walk or breathe and sweats a lot because she eats terrible foods.  How's your health right now?  Not good.  Not good?  Why don't you tell me?  Um, I eat a lot.  Eat a lot of sweets.  I eat a lot of food, so I'm not that healthy. 
[04:13:30]  Yeah.  I don't eat vegetables, a lot of vegetables.  And I know walking is not easy for you.  No, I get tired quick.  I sweat a lot.  Um, and I breathe hard when I walk, so it's hard for me to walk.  Anyway, where's the Oreo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It's hard for me to breathe, to catch my breath when I'm having sex with people. 
[04:14:00]  Oh, she a pisser.  Get me more Tyra.  Yeah.  That's your job, Sam.  Love the Tyra.  Sam, that's your only job on the show.  Crying Tyra.  My narrative.  Tyra.  Me, me, me, Tyra.  Me, Tyra.  Me, me, me, me.  Me, me, me, me.  I, me, I, me, me, me.  I, I, I.  Love it.  All right.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Bill, thank you.  Bill Burr did a great job today for Jim Norton.  Here comes the judge. 
[04:14:30]  The judge.  Jesus, Anthony.  Sorry.  Just so the listeners don't get mad at me, all thoughts and prayers are out for Jim Norton  right now.  Jesus, Anthony.  Here comes probation officer.  The probation officer.  He'd understand.  It's a joke.  We knew it would happen eventually.  It's good.  Any, any, any press is good press.  Right.  Here's today's runner-up line of the day. 
[04:15:00]  Jägermeister?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could tell that.  Screaming Nazis.  You sound like a, that's screaming Nazis, man.  Nice.  You sound like a Jägermeister buzz.  Yeah.  Well, I, I'm trying to get off the tequila.  I'm changing.  Yeah.  And I was going to, that was my next choice.  It's the Jäger years.  Oh, I know this chick.  I'm changing to the Jäger years.  You should.  You were married to her for 10 years.  I'm sorry.  And I couldn't resist.  You're sorry. 
[04:15:30]  Yes.  Is that a little back and forth?  That was a little back and forth.  All right.  A little, I think you had the line there.  That one.  I'll share a runner-up line with Taylor.  I was married to her.  That was, uh, that was a good one.  All right.  Uh, line of the, line of the day sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout  against the Russians.  It's all on Bodogfight.com.  I would crush you.  Here's today's line of the day.  Drago.  Here comes 
[04:16:00]  Till the line of the day, line of the day, line of the day, line of the day.  It's wonderful.  Okay, okay.  You're getting me upset again because I've always been self-conscious about my chest because  my boobs are so big.  Guys always want to suck on my chest.  I see your second chest food. 
[04:16:30]  Hey, there you go.  Yeah, that was correct.  Kind of needed to set up, but I mean, I'm sure you just heard it.  If you listened to the last night.  Yeah, I'm sure you'd heard it.  Bill Burr, line of the day.  Congratulations, Bill Burr.  Thank you.  We'll see you at the Stress Factory sometime this weekend, okay?  Absolutely.  All right, fellas.  Jimmy, get back soon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Kevin?  What's up?  Oh, Big Kev's got something going on.  I will be appearing at the National Convention this weekend, 17th, 18th, and 19th at the 
[04:17:00]  Penn Plaza Pavilion, 401.  I don't like his Santa Claus notes.  7th Avenue, 33rd Street, with such superstars as Val Kilmer and Adam West.  Adam West.  Adam West.  Thank you.  BigAppleCon.com.  It's out, um, Friday-wide.  All right, uh, we'll do a little best of shit, and then what?  Oh.  That's just the latest.  Another. 
[04:17:30]  What?  What is this?  No.  Store robbed of five PlayStation 3s.  Nice.  I told you this would get ugly.  Still waiting for the, uh, story where someone gets killed.  Getting close.  Getting close.  Uh, blah, blah, blah.  Two of our men wearing black ski masks and sunglasses robbed the EB Game Store.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, Englewood, New Jersey, I guess?  That would be, right?  One of those just bust the joint open, run in, run out?  Yeah.  Is that what they did?  Or was the place open at the time?  According to Englewood Police Office. 
[04:18:00]  Arms man robbing, I guess then it's not burglary.  How hard are they laughing right now?  Yep.  I don't know.  Jackasses stood in line for fucking days.  Let's stand in line with a gun.  All right, guys.  Yes.  We'll see you on Monday.  Another banner week.  Oh, laughter clubs.  What's this about?  Huh?  It doesn't look funny.  Can we get this for Monday, please?  Yes.  Boy, slow news day on CNN, huh?  Ah.  This looks awful. 
[04:18:30]  I earned that laughter club.  It just came from up.  And suddenly, four o'clock in the morning, I got this idea, why not start a laughter club?  What began with five people in a Mumbai park in 1995 has spread to more than 5,000 laughter clubs in 50 countries.  Stop it.  You don't need any sense of humor to laugh.  You don't need to be happy in order to laugh.  In fact, when you laugh, you develop your sense of humor.  Excuse me, why do the people in the laughter clubs look like they're watching an Al-Qaeda video? 
[04:19:00]  Even if you have to fake the laughter.  It's a claim backed up by Lee Burke at Loma Linda University.  Burke has found laughter decreases stress hormones.  Same guy that gave Sam the advice on the asparagus.  Same doctor.  Dr. Kataria, who began the laughter club movement, says people who laugh are, like the Dalai Lama, living in the moment. 
[04:19:30]  Joyfulness makes you feel good immediately.  It's now.  And that's what children do.  And I want everybody in this world to live like a child.  Now.  Just now.  Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN.  They're called crazy people.  You know, it has become a practice right here on the newsroom that 15 minutes before the show, that's what we do.  That's what we do.  Every day, right here.  Laugh therapy.  Hey, if you'd like that, get a look at this.  Sunday night, Sanjay has a full, hour-long special, Happiness. 
[04:20:00]  Holy shit.  Wow.  I love those guys who always, who like, preach, like, you know, happiness and being in the moment.  And then you see they have, like, hair plugs and they, like, dye their hair.  Yeah, yeah.  Right there, all your credibility.  You're unhappy.  All your credibility is out the fucking window.  You're unhappy.  We leave you today with this.  Have a good weekend.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[04:20:30]  And I'm happy, I'm relaxed.  I'm happy, I'm relaxed.  I'm happy, I'm relaxed.  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  This is not what I'm used to.  Here it is, live.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Nothing but foul language and toilet humor.  For the new listeners who think that we've learned our lesson, uh-uh.  Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.  Poopy.  Malarkey. 
[04:21:00]  Tiny.  Cooley.  Let me titter.  I get it.  Someone pinch me.  Whoopity doo.  K-sirah-sirah.  Mumbo-jumbo.  Good natured joshing around.  Puppy cock.  Poopy jokes.  Silly.  I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna.  We just chit-chat and go nuts.  What do you think of them apples?  It's lame.  It's not even fun to listen to, you know?  I don't know how they could screw up something that simple.  Oh!  But boy, they sure did. 
[04:21:30]  Poopy and Anthony!  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.  If you want to vote for Line of the Week, go to iliketolisten.com.  I'm gonna do it.  I'm gonna do it.  I'm gonna do it.  I'm gonna do it. </pre>
