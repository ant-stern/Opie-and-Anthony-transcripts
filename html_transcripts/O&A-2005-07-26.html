<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  The show opened with humorous banter about becoming a radio DJ, a comedic scene from *Blazing Saddles*, and Opie's frightening raccoon encounter.  This segued into a discussion of their Penthouse interview, notably its provocative opening paragraph mentioning a wheelchair-bound man and a dildo, and an upcoming XM Satellite Radio announcement.

The Penthouse article and Jim Norton's Hustler porn review were recurring themes, interspersed with discussions of XM Radio's new portable device, business deals with Harley Davidson and Starbucks, and a graphic Canadian public service announcement against domestic violence.  A significant portion focused on their feud with radio personality Jim Phillips, culminating in a declared victory and cessation of further conflict.  Callers contributed to the chaos, with one discussing rumors about a company CEO and another boasting about his Hustler porn review.  The hosts also delved into payola and plugola investigations by Eliot Spitzer, debating its harmfulness and potential victims, along with XM's unsigned bands channel and past criticisms from a radio personality nicknamed "Grease Man," including his appearances on news channels attacking the show.  Throughout, vulgar language and offensive humor were prevalent.  The only explicitly mentioned studio guests were Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.


The show continued with a discussion of coffee preferences, particularly Starbucks, and internal communication problems within the show's staff.  A caller mentioned Sandy Fox's praise on XM 150, leading to a discussion of a Greaseman segment on Fox News criticizing O&A's "Sex for Sam" incident at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Attempts to play the audio were hampered by staff member Eric's incompetence, resulting in further comedic banter.  Jim Norton's weight loss, a bizarre exchange about a crusty substance on an apple, and a phone call with Sean Hannity, who discussed his show, political views, and his own experience listening to O&A (sometimes having to turn it off due to explicit content), were featured.  The hosts also discussed their return to New York City commercial radio, along with tangents on taxes, the ACLU, a car chase on Fox News, political commentary on the Bush administration, and a heated discussion about random searches after terrorist attacks.  Calls from "O-Town" led to insults comparing New York and Orlando, and the segment concluded with mention of an upcoming interview with the editor of Giant Magazine.


The next segment focused on their firing from Infinity Broadcasting, heavily featuring Fox News coverage, including sexually explicit jokes with Bill O'Reilly.  A caller, James, used homophobic slurs towards the hosts and the call screener.  The hosts also addressed a call screener allegedly discouraging a birthday gift for Jim Norton.  The Greaseman's commentary on Fox News was mocked, and the hosts disputed the financial details of their contract reported by the news. They also addressed false reports concerning an April Fool's Day prank involving the Boston mayor.  The segment also included the discussion of an upcoming interview with Black Sabbath, with Jim Norton's nervousness highlighted.  This led to an interview with Jamie Hooper of Giant Magazine, discussing the magazine's content, including a Matthew Modine *Full Metal Jacket* photo essay and the upcoming "Aristocrats" movie.  The conversation covered various celebrities, the magazine's unique approach, cult films and TV shows, the death of minor celebrities, AC/DC's album sales, and listener calls about Parker Posey and the "Aristocrats" movie.

The following segment continued the Jamie Hooper interview, focusing on Giant Magazine's resurgence, including a multi-page spread featuring Opie and Anthony (mentioning full-frontal nudity and urination).  They discussed the adult magazine industry and its future.  A gender error concerning Hooper's sibling was noted.  The show then featured Pepper Keenan of COC, who recounted a humorous anecdote about being mistaken for a woman by hotel security.  This was followed by an interview with synchronized diver Chelsea Davis and her coach, Barbara, regarding Davis's diving accident.  A substantial portion covered the "Aristocrats" documentary, including Cartman's extremely graphic version of the joke, referencing 9/11, and naming various comedians involved.  A new segment, "Travis Watches TV," debuted, showing a Fox 5 news segment on a toilet paper factory.  The show provided live space shuttle launch coverage, including commentary and listener calls.  Jim Norton's search for Ozfest shorts was also documented.


The final segment began with a caller from Winter Park, Florida, who drove to Titusville.  This led to a discussion of planned face transplants, focusing on accident/burn victims and eventual cosmetic uses.  Footage of a Space Shuttle fuel tank separation was shown.  A caller from Wyoming complained about visibility, followed by a news report on a "cool mom" in Colorado who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting high school boys.  Further calls included one from Texas saying "papa booey," a Florida caller whose mother's Hummel figurines broke from launch vibrations, and a caller mentioning long cords' danger to children.  A vulgar song sing-along, more calls (one about a previous "Voss" story, another about a graphic first sexual encounter), and a discussion on Raisin Bran's bowel movement effects followed.  Finally, callers commented on what they learned (or didn't) and the upcoming guest, Jimmy Norton, was mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, how do you become a radio DJ? 
[00:04:00]  Say the name of the station over and over. 
[00:04:30]  Play at least a half hour of commercials.  Broadcast live from the quickie mark.  Smash the sounds together.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Don't, Fred.  I've seen the cops knocking the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS. 
[00:05:00]  Mom, please stop fooling me.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS. I thought the man was dead. That's the way it was.  It's impossible. It's impossible. It's impossible. I'm trying to tell you that. What do you want? You want some tears to come out of my eyes?  Oh, help me. Help me. Help me.  I got it. I got it. I got it from a Negro. 
[00:05:30]  I just saw that the other night. It was on, of course. Had to put it on the TV, Caddyshack.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Always funny, and it's just full of clips that we play on the show.  Like every two seconds of that movie, there's another clip that you're like, ah, we use that all the time.  Wait. 
[00:06:00]  Anyway, you can turn that down. I was going to try to play some, but it had music under it.  Oh.  Hey, Pat Battle is on this.  What are you saying? Pat Battle is near.  No, God's blaming, Jay Williams.  Pat Battle is on this.  Hey. 
[00:06:30]  Pat Battle is on this.  What a hysterical scene in that movie, man. 
[00:07:00]  He's jumping up and down and pointing.  And how the whole town just goes quiet when he rides up.  Rolls up their welcome banner like a curtain shade.  Blazing Saddles.  Another one of these movies that start off just unbelievable, got really good, and then just completely falls apart.  Fell apart at the end. They just didn't know what to do with it.  They just didn't know how to end it. 
[00:07:30]  I don't remember how it did end. I haven't seen it in music.  It kind of ended with them running around the studios.  The studio, the back lot.  The back lot of Warner Brothers, I guess it was.  Into the, I don't know, the dining area. It was just like, what?  Later used by other movies.  Yeah.  Like, what, Pee Wee?  Well, we got lots.  Pee Wee's a big adventure.  We got lots to do today. I don't even know where to begin.  I know. I got a little scared last night. I heard a sound outside.  Yeah.  You know me. I'm all paranoid.  It sounded like the, we have these garbage things. They're actually in the ground. 
[00:08:00]  Get this. They're in the ground.  They got, like, metal lids on them.  Hinged, big, heavy metal lids.  And you just open up the sliding glass door in the back and put the garbage in there.  And the garbage men, there's no garbage pails on our street.  There's no garbage pails.  They come around back, open up the thing, and take the pail out.  And take it to the truck.  So I heard, like, a clang, clang, clang. 
[00:08:30]  Like, oh, boy, what's that?  Now I got to find out or I'm going to be scared all night that it's a burglar or something.  And I open up the blinds.  I grab my rapier, my big sword.  I'm going to poke somebody with it.  And I open up the curtains and take a look outside.  I turn the light on.  And there was a coon on my patio just sitting there.  And it had gone through the garbage and pulled out some bread 
[00:09:00]  and was just eating it on the porch.  It's a little frightening, you know?  A little raccoon.  Raccoon.  Wow.  What?  That's really impressive.  I was quite frightened at first hearing the noise.  You know that we have a national talk show, right?  Yeah.  We're talking to people from Alabama every day.  Yeah.  Other parts of the country.  Sure. 
[00:09:30]  A raccoon to them is nothing.  Of course it isn't, but I heard a little noise.  It's like more than ever, dude.  I got scared.  There are people that actually...  Jimmy's nodding.  There are people that actually listen to the show that have to deal with bears on a daily basis.  That's scary.  So do we, Steve.  I'm just hungry.  I just would eat and then hold another gentleman.  Jesus.  So you were able to go back to bed?  Yes.  See, that solved the problem.  If I hadn't looked, I would have been scared that there was something out there. 
[00:10:00]  Was it human-like?  They're so adorable.  Yeah.  It was just sitting out there with its little hands, holding the piece of bread, and eating  it with his little hands and wearing his little burglar mask.  You know, they got that little raccoon burglar mask on, and he was nibbling on the bread.  Standing up on his little hind legs, all fat.  Perfect place for a shotgun blast, that little stomach. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  It's adorable.  But you were able to get back to sleep, right?  Of course.  Very good.  Thank goodness.  Can I read the first paragraph of our latest article that came out today?  I just saw this today.  It's near the end of a typical Thursday show for Opie, real name Greg Hughes, and Anthony,  last name Kumia, at their new XM Studios located near Central Park in New York City.  The guys and their sidekick, Jim Norton, are on the air. 
[00:11:00]  Sidekick.  Listening.  I know.  They'll never get it completely right.  That's fine.  The guys and their sidekick, Jim Norton, are on the air, listening to call-in guests' wheelchair  Fred report the day's news from his bathtub as he inserts a dildo into his ass.  And the FCC can do nothing but sit back and listen with them.  That's the first paragraph, huh?  That is the opening paragraph of our penthouse interview. 
[00:11:30]  A crippled man shoving a dildo in his ass is the first paragraph.  That has hit the newsstands, Anthony.  Some things just never change.  I don't know what.  I think this is like the January 2006 penthouse.  Yeah, that's how they do it.  They put them out months and months in advance.  I don't know what.  I think it's September.  No.  Maybe September.  Is it?  It's July.  I think it's September.  September 2005.  July 2005, yeah.  Our names are on the cover in case you're trying to figure out which penthouse it is, okay? 
[00:12:00]  It says Opie and Anthony.  I don't know.  Where is the cover?  Where is the magazine, actually?  But pretty interesting article.  Same shit, to be honest with you.  Same crap.  Yeah, my uncle was reading this, saw him over the weekend, and he goes, boy, do they ask  you any new questions?  Or is it the same interview from three years ago that they use?  Yeah, pretty much.  It's pretty much the same stuff.  Yep.  Rehashed. 
[00:12:30]  And, uh...  Are there restraints on you?  Yeah.  A bunch of pictures.  You might want to pick that up today if you're out and about.  Yeah, it's the September 2005 penthouse.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  They're finally censor-free.  What's next?  What's next for Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony?  So, there you have it.  The bad boys of radio are now censor-free.  So, what have they been waiting ten years to say?  Ten years? 
[00:13:00]  Well, if you read the article, you don't find...  Oh, because we're censor-free.  You don't find the answer to that question, really?  No, there's not.  That question is not answered in this article.  But that's the first thing asked.  And I don't think he actually ever answers that.  We're not honest in this, either.  Why?  It says, what would happen if you put a ten-year-old kid in your studio?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I say things like, the show isn't for ten-year-old kids, inappropriate.  So, why are we being honest? 
[00:13:30]  Ah, because you put a ten-year-old kid in here, and he's getting some action.  Jesus.  Maybe from two out of the three.  Yeah.  Yeah, two out of the three.  All right.  So, that's out.  And it's pretty cool.  Pretty cool for us.  Yeah.  The first picture makes me look like I'm a giant, and that I'm working with some kind  of midget.  Where's that?  Well, where's the...  Here.  Oh, I didn't notice. 
[00:14:00]  It was the first picture?  Yeah, a little trick photography.  I thought it was the one on the stairs.  I guess I'm continuing to...  Later on.  I'm continuing to grow for some reason.  I look like I'm 6'8", and you look like you're about...  Oh, right.  You look maybe 5'8".  Yeah, we're on the stairs or something.  Oh, no, we're not.  I'm that much taller than you.  Yeah.  Well, if you are, then you're freakish.  I don't think that would be a good thing.  But they don't explain that it's a picture that was taken on the stairs, because it's  just a picture of our... 
[00:14:30]  Well, from the waist up, I guess.  And you're a lot shorter than me.  That's hilarious.  It really is.  Most people looking at that would think that you're just...  I'm a midget.  A little guy.  I'm like Paul Simon-Height.  Right.  That's pretty awful.  Kind of weird.  He seems really tough when I listen to him on the show, but he can't be more than 5'5".  The guy's a midget.  Whatever.  So, if you want, you can pick that up.  Penthouse, September 2005. 
[00:15:00]  Opie and Anthony, they're finally censor-free.  What's next for the boys?  And again, that isn't answered.  Huh?  And again, that question not answered.  No.  Another announcement to be made on the Opie and Anthony show is that we will have an announcement  coming soon.  Ah.  That's an announcement.  We will have an announcement coming soon.  Yeah.  So, keep on listening for that.  I think within the week, I guess.  Within the week?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:15:30]  Does that mean within this week?  Within a week from now.  Oh, okay.  Actually, less than a week from now.  I believe.  I think you've pretty much narrowed it down.  I'm not really sure, but I think within less than a week from right now, we'll have an  announcement.  Mm-hmm.  That's going to be very cool for us.  What's it rhyme with?  Huh?  Um, no, I can't.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This thing's going on.  Yeah, we can't say.  This thing's going on, so. 
[00:16:00]  The corporate people are so fussy about their little secrets all the time.  They have so many little secrets, this company.  And they just put them out on certain days, certain times.  No one can talk about them before that.  Don't talk about the secret.  I'm not talking about the company announcements.  They've got some nice announcements coming up soon.  I'm talking about just an announcement that affects us personally, that's all.  Yeah.  And, uh, no, I mean, XM announced a couple things.  They announced a deal with Harley Davidson yesterday.  Harley Davidson.  What, are you able to have XM on your bike? 
[00:16:30]  Very cool.  On the new bikes.  Nice.  We love the Harleys.  And then, um, they're doing compilation CDs with Starbucks.  That's starting.  They're going to have their first compilation CD.  All coffee songs, right?  Pretty much.  I mean, it's, it's stuff.  These songs are there about coffee.  It's not, it's stuff that I wouldn't listen to.  Coffee CD.  I don't know.  It's like artists like Jewel and stuff, I guess.  Jewel.  It's the stuff you hear on that Here Now channel on XM. 
[00:17:00]  Yep.  They're going to be, uh, putting out these compilation CDs.  They're going to be available at every Starbucks.  That's pretty cool.  It'll have the XM logo all over the thing.  She spilled my coffee.  You bitch.  We haven't played that in a while.  I love that one.  Here, set that up, man.  We'll play that really fast.  PSA, Canadian PSA.  It was supposed to be against domestic violence.  And, uh, they were so graphic and brutal that they were pulled.  And this one shows a guy sitting with his little children at a restaurant.  The waitress comes up, spills his coffee.  He gets upset about it and pummels her and spills hot coffee on her tits. 
[00:17:30]  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  I'll bring him a little coffee.  How do you like this?  Stop it!  You wouldn't get away with it here.  You shouldn't get away with it at home.  Yeah, they were really brutal.  Yeah, we liked that.  The whole point, of course.  Yeah, you can't be out doing that.  So why should you be allowed to do it in the privacy of your own home when your wife doesn't listen? 
[00:18:00]  Absolutely.  I mean, if you're going to serve coffee, you make sure you don't fill it to the very tippy top.  Don't spill it.  That's the message.  That is the message.  Careful, careful, clumsy.  You don't know what kind of go-getter is going to be sitting at your table.  Kind of problem solver.  Let me ask you, does this announcement have anything to do with my birthday today?  It's not your birthday!  Jimmy.  It was a week ago.  At least wait a few months.  Try to bring up your birthday again. 
[00:18:30]  You don't like birthdays.  What did you get for your birthday?  Do you still get presents?  Did you get something from the parents?  My parents sent me, and I love my parents, what is arguably the worst birthday shirt anybody's ever gotten.  They mean well.  They sure do.  It's a Scarface shirt, but it's red.  Oh!  I'm going to wear it in one day. 
[00:19:00]  You have to.  You have to.  Is it really just you see it out of your peripheral vision, even if you're behind me?  They photographed it from the Hubble.  You can't not see it.  It's the type of shirt that hurts your eyes, right?  You can't not see it.  The colors just mess up your eyes.  Here's the big announcement from XM today.  I'm trying to find the Starbucks to give you the details on that.  XM portable device to play radio and MP3s.  The first of its kind, Anthony.  Once again, XM Satellite Radio, the leader in satellite radio, has reached an alliance with Samsung to produce a new portable device that plays both satellite radio and MP3s. 
[00:19:30]  Nice.  This is huge news.  An announcement is expected today.  It marks the second portable device offered from XM and the first in the industry to combine satellite radio and the ability to download digital audio files from online music services.  The device, which does not yet have a name, is to be sold during the holiday season, so that's very good.  I'd call it the Lil' Jimmy. 
[00:20:00]  You carry around the Lil' Jimmy with you.  I like that.  Wouldn't that be nice?  It's an honor for my birthday.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, we already have the MiFi.  XM's rival, Sirius Satellite Radio, has announced plans for a portable player to be named Rego, but it has not yet been released.  Oh, still with that thing?  I think they announced that, what, six, seven months ago?  Like a year ago.  Really?  I have no idea.  At least in my world, six or seven months ago.  What Sirius is actually doing is they're actually going to have a smaller car built that you just carry on your back. 
[00:20:30]  You can roll down the passenger window to enjoy your unit.  You know, it's not even fair anymore.  They're not even competing with us anymore.  They're doing their own little cute thing over there.  Now consumers can enjoy XM's live programming plus music from their personal digital music collections,  and one easy-to-use, elegant player, said Hugh Pinero, president and CEO of XM Satellite Radio.  It goes on and on, and basically it shows the stock.  Did you know that XM went from $28 a share to $36 since May? 
[00:21:00]  Nice.  It's creeping up every day, just creeping, creeping, creeping, creeping.  Slow build.  That's a good way to go for a stock.  Let's see.  By the end of the year, XM plans to announce a third device that is fully portable.  So by the end of the year, there's going to be a device that you can listen to live XM programming  and also do the old MP3 thing as well.  XM has about 4.5 million subscribers, a number that should jump to about 5.5 million by the end of the year. 
[00:21:30]  And the cute other company has 1.5.  That's adorable.  1.5 million.  There you go.  Woof, woof.  Let's see.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Eric in Boston.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Just warming up.  I hear that, guys.  But I'm guessing on the announcement because I've got some insider trading information.  Yeah.  And I understand that Shitadel is actually returning the investments that everyone made 
[00:22:00]  in their shit company.  Yeah.  Sure they are.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Just waiting for that one to break even so I could get out of it, but it doesn't look like  You see how it creeps up to like 12 and then just goes back down in the 11s and stuff.  It just never goes up.  It has one day where it goes up like 4 cents.  Then it goes down another 10 cents.  It's just what a lemon that one was.  Well, I'm hearing rumors. 
[00:22:30]  Thanks for Reed.  I'm hearing rumors.  The CEO of the company has given up on running the damn thing.  And he's running around with a young broad down in Soho.  With some young broad?  Down in Soho.  Where are you hearing these rumors?  I got my ear to the grindstone or whatever they call it.  Your ear to the grindstone?  What do they call it?  I'm just hearing, what do they call it?  The ear to the old.  You can have your ear to the pavement.  The ear to the, what did the Indians used to do?  Ear to the trail.  And then they could hear the horses coming.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  Ear to the whiskey bottle.  I'm doing something.  Exactly.  I'm doing something like that there.  Ear to the government land.  Jim in Staten Island, what's up?  Oh, Jim.  Jimmy, let's go.  What?  Hello.  Holy crap.  Hey.  Yeah, what's your name?  Jim, I'm from New Jersey.  Bye-bye.  That figures.  So you're not going to talk because we got your town wrong, even though we're on the phone with you.  Yeah.  You want to know what magazine your porn review is in?  Oh.  Oh, right. 
[00:23:30]  Hustler.  Hustler?  Is it Hustler?  Hustler.  Hustler.  So we got all the smut magazines covered this month.  Oh, isn't that great?  Jimmy's in Hustler.  More proud moments for me and for my family.  I could show mom so she could read how we had a crippled guy shove a dildo in his ass in the first paragraph.  I can't even tell her.  Don't read the whole article.  Just, you know, read the beginning.  First paragraph.  Shove dildo in ass in bathtub.  It's not bad enough that the article's in Penthouse Magazine.  You're correct, Anthony. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Because usually when I have to, you know, hand these in to my family, I have to cut out all  the new pictures around our article.  Yeah.  So they can read the actual article.  But, yeah, we can't even hide this time because you're right.  The article starts with us talking to a guy that has a dildo up his ass.  That's the first paragraph of what?  Isn't that great?  Of our exclusive Penthouse interview in the September 2005 issue.  You're 100% right.  Hey, mom, look.  I'm in Penthouse.  All right. 
[00:24:30]  Let's say, hi to Neil is God.  Neil is God.  What's up?  It's Neil.  But, hey, guys, not one single phone call yesterday.  Yeah.  Sorry, you don't have any friends.  Not one.  And I would like to give out that number for everybody since it was not busy yesterday.  Wait, you want us to call you at home?  No, I'm talking about shit dick Phillips.  Oh, Phillips.  I think at this point we've got to declare victory, don't we?  I think we've killed him. 
[00:25:00]  I think we've got to declare victory on the Jim Phillips thing.  What about that new technology he's getting Wednesday?  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  What are we going to do with the Jim Phillips thing?  I just hate to see all the poor members of the Army have to sit through that on a daily basis.  Wow.  I guess yesterday he just completely bailed on this whole thing.  No calls, no references. 
[00:25:30]  Even though he was the one that said bring it on.  Let's not forget that he said bring it on.  He made a big joke that, uh, ONA Army, what is that?  Yeah.  What, they got three listeners that are going to call me?  Well, well, fellas, bring it on.  Let's not forget.  He was the one that said bring it on, and in the end he couldn't take it at all.  Yeah.  I guess he's throwing up the white flag behind the scenes, and he's had it.  He's had it.  He knows he can't take this shit anymore.  I will say the pests, uh, I gotta, I'm in awe.  I know.  Of the job.  I, I, I can't believe it. 
[00:26:00]  They are the biggest pests ever.  Ever.  You completely, uh, brought down the guy's, uh, show.  This is what happened.  And, uh, yeah.  There was no references made, no phone calls taken, and, um, quite frankly, I, I personally  cannot take listening to it anymore.  I tried yesterday, but without any real references or, uh, or any phone calls getting through,  it was just impossible to listen to.  I know this is probably going to bum out some members of the ONA Army, but I think it's time 
[00:26:30]  to throw Mr. Phillips back into the, the old lake of obscurity.  Whatever, you know.  To throw him right back into the lake of obscurity.  Whatever they want to do, you know, it's their life, the, uh, the pests.  So whatever they do, they do.  But I don't see us giving them any more, uh, credit or time or, or, um, or what's the word  I'm looking for here?  You said time or credit or credit or time, basically.  The word popularity was coming into my head. 
[00:27:00]  But publicity is what I was looking for.  Popular music.  Publicity.  Popular music.  I just, my brain completely shut off.  Yes.  Publicity was the word I was looking for.  We don't want people to burn out.  There's going to be many more of these situations.  Yeah.  Quite frankly, he was never really worth all the time and effort.  You know, unfortunately, he's, was such a huge idiot that, uh, the, the Army just had  to pounce and attack.  Um, but really, the guy isn't even worth the time. 
[00:27:30]  He's the latest casualty in a much, much, much bigger war that we are fighting.  We pretty much, at this point, hate commercial radio.  It's a fact.  We absolutely hate it.  And we look forward to, to, uh, doing our part to, uh, destroy it.  Yeah.  This is the future of radio.  People are starting to figure that out.  I mean, every day there's another XM announcement.  Again.  It's just going by leaps and bounds every day.  The Army's going to do what they're going to do.  So, you know, whatever. 
[00:28:00]  I understand.  What are you going to do?  I understand.  I was amazed at how well they organized, though.  Were they, were they ever that well organized?  No.  At any W?  I mean, it seems like.  No, no, no.  They're getting better and better.  Because they know how much more important it is.  And there is going to be a much bigger fight that we will take on.  No problem.  Absolutely no problem whatsoever.  So.  But this show, um, probably not dedicate much more time to him.  Tell you the truth.  I don't, I don't want to make him, uh, you know, bigger.  Well, that's the whole thing.  I want him to be his, you know, continue being, uh, the one market sensation that he is. 
[00:28:30]  Which is a pretty good thing to, to have in radio.  Hey, congrats.  But, you know, it's time to throw him back into obscurity as far as the national platform goes.  I really don't want the, the press to pick up on it and run with it.  You know what I mean?  Like, oh, it's a battle.  Because it just makes us look bad that we're battling the likes of him, you know?  Right.  So, uh, eh, whatever.  I'm sure it'll come up every so often, but.  Oh, we'll be watching him.  Trust me, we'll be watching him. 
[00:29:00]  Because he is a douchebag.  Mm-hmm.  I have no problem saying that.  He is a douchebag.  A liar.  A phony.  Pretty much, he, he is what is wrong with commercial radio.  He's a perfect example.  So what you're saying is basically that this show is ready to move on in honor of my birthday.  It's not your birthday.  Birthday again.  A week later.  Stop it.  I didn't get any gifts.  I didn't get you anything. 
[00:29:30]  I feel so bad.  I don't know.  Well, you gave me 20 bucks the other day, which I owe you back.  Oh, I didn't even think about that.  Oh, yeah.  I forget about money.  I owe you like $20 as well.  Yeah, you owe me 20.  Please, I know who to ask.  I'm like, hey, you got 20 bucks.  I knew he'd forget.  I forget about money.  There you go, Anthony.  Ah, thank you.  Hold it away.  There you go.  Jesus.  Did I borrow 20 or 10?  Let me think.  Give Anthony back his $20, Jimmy.  I do it tomorrow because I need money for OddFest.  Jimmy, you don't have to pay me right now.  Is OddFest today?  Sure is.  Very cool, very cool. 
[00:30:00]  I even have my photos all ready to be signed.  Oh.  For the interviews.  Nice.  He's got his little bag.  I've got to write down questions.  I don't have any questions.  People are going to check that bag, you know.  I'll let him.  It's fine.  There's only photos in there and a couple of cities.  All right, we're going to take our first break, and we're going to continue with the  O.P. and Anthony show.  That's our latest update, so what did we accomplish in this first break?  Our penthouse interview is out, Anthony.  Yes.  The September 2005 issue.  We're on the cover if you're looking for it.  Shock Talk's O.P. and Anthony. 
[00:30:30]  There's finally censor-free.  What's next?  Also, Jim Norton's Hustler Porn Reviews is out there somewhere still, right?  Yes.  I'm going to read that.  I haven't read it.  Also, we'll have an announcement on this show that affects us, and I guess the channel,  202.  Yeah.  We'll have that in less than a week, and we are personally throwing Jim Phillips back  into the lake of obscurity.  Obscurity.  Back you go.  Let's not forget, he was the one who said, bring it on, and in the end, he couldn't take 
[00:31:00]  it whatsoever.  I'm like, God, I know the announcement, Ben.  I'm sorry.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O-A-Day virus.  Oh, what's up, Po?  Hey, guys.  I don't mean to interrupt you.  I wasn't drunk.  You can't get drunk over coffee, orange juice, eggs, bacon.  I didn't say you were drunk.  Who said drunk?  Eric said you were drunk.  Eric.  I would never accuse Master Poe of being drunk when he was in the street. 
[00:31:30]  Sounded like a complete asshole.  O-A-Party Rock.  O-A-Party Rock.  That is a great clip.  O-A-Party Rock.  Yeah, okay.  What the hell is O-A-Party Rock?  All right, well, fine.  I was enjoying myself.  I was told to go down and hand out stickers and have a good time.  It's high on life, not alcohol.  You didn't hear the clip because you can have sex with them.  O-A-Party Rock.  Yeah, that's a good one.  But you know what I noticed?  You got to admit, it sounds a little, you know. 
[00:32:00]  Four days.  O-A-Party Rock.  Four days.  I lost my voice and I couldn't really talk.  And I was told to go down and hand out stickers.  Club Soda Kenny told me to go down and hand out stickers and have a good time.  And that's exactly what I did.  O-A-Party Rock.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know what O-A-Party Rock means.  All right, well, whatever.  I do notice that.  We did all acknowledge how you did a great job down there, though.  You handed out thousands and thousands of wow stickers for us.  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  And cups and all.  But he was getting on this microphone that another club had in the middle of thousands of people on the street.  And this is what he was coming up with.  O-A-Party Rock.  No, no.  That's sign of tension, get it.  That's the only thing.  That's not the only thing I say.  All right, so you want to go on record and say that when you did this.  O-A-Party Rock.  You weren't drunk.  No, I wasn't drunk.  That clip gets funnier and funnier, man.  All right, very good.  Thank you, Master Paul.  So you left here yesterday, and what happened? 
[00:33:00]  Traffic.  Were you doing heroin with Master Paul?  No, I...  Oh, my God.  Guys, what are you doing to me?  I don't take drugs.  I don't do any of that stuff.  That's a little play on the last joke.  Yeah, it was kind of a sarcastic statement about Eric's exaggeration.  There was a lot of sarcasm in that statement.  Okay.  About Eric's...  You point to Eric, Jimmy.  You try to pawn it off on Eric.  There was a little play on what Eric said.  Remember when he called you drunk?  I know, Paul was the only kid.  He just has so much coke in the morning. 
[00:33:30]  He comes in and he gets all...  Well, according to Eric.  According to Eric.  Oh, my God.  You are dead.  You're a dead man.  Eric, tell everyone what you were telling us in the office.  Yeah, what we told everyone.  Where you saw him in the stall.  Doing what?  Uh-oh.  Bent over the stall.  Doing something.  No?  Oh, boy.  He doesn't want to share on the air.  You're asking for it.  He's scared for his life.  I don't blame him, you know?  Neither do I.  Obi and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[00:34:00]  This whole wide world I've traveled  I've seen the sins of other men  The secrets I've unraveled  They made me who I am today  Do you want to throw out all of my dreams?  Can you tell me what this all did mean?  Jimmy, what are we listening to? 
[00:34:30]  He's a butler.  Oh.  New lead song, Mismet.  Well.  Phenomenal.  Very nice.  Yes.  Phenomenal.  It's not bad at all.  And you're going to OzFest today with Martini Steve?  Yes.  Very good.  I'll be blithering like an idiot through interviews.  And where is that this evening?  PNC.  We're actually going to be at the second stage.  A lot of it.  The Jägermeister 10.  Those guys were phenomenal, man.  They hooked us up with everything.  Yeah.  Everything we needed, Jäger really came through. 
[00:35:00]  Everything.  Because tickets were impossible to get  and they came through and really helped us out a lot.  They got the Jäger chicks.  They're going to be Jäger chicks.  A whole big cookout.  There's going to be...  Food.  All kinds of food.  All kinds of...  Obviously, I'm not drinking today.  I don't think anybody else is here.  I hope not because you're driving.  I am?  Yeah.  My car is six months late in inspection.  It is.  No.  I'm sorry.  Seven.  Why haven't you gotten your vehicle inspected?  What happened was the man was really big.  Yeah.  I drove away. 
[00:35:30]  You obviously don't park on the streets of New York City.  Because mine is up and I'm taking care of it  because these bastards we've talked about,  not only do they give out meter tickets,  they also walk around and just check registration stickers  right at midnight.  Last time I got caught at midnight,  my inspection was up one minute according to the ticket.  Really?  And there's assholes out there who go,  well, technically, you know, it was over.  Nah, that's just being a scumbag. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  I mean, there's a point where they're just being complete scumbags  and looking for cash for the city.  I've had my vehicle for about a year.  I think next month it'll be a year.  I know that I've had it,  and it has never, ever had an inspection sticker on its windshield.  And you haven't been pulled over for that?  Nah.  You're lucky, man.  I've had it there.  It actually has gotten me out of bigger trouble a lot of times.  I was speeding once upstate, doing a 90 and a 45,  and I got pulled over, and I actually got out of the ticket. 
[00:36:30]  The guy decided to just write me up for the lack of inspection.  It's like, okay, he said, I don't have any points on my license,  and, you know, you could check, which he did.  He went back to the car, checked it out.  He goes, all right, I'm going to write you up for the inspection, though.  Hey, go ahead.  Pay that one off, no points.  I've gotten out of a couple of things, making illegal terms,  like the moving violations, the ones that give you the points.  If I could trade that off for uninspected, do it every time.  So I haven't put an inspection sticker on my windshield.  Jesus. 
[00:37:00]  I've got to get shorts.  It's hot.  It's going to be hot.  It's going to be the hottest day of the summer.  Well, according to Ben, I'm looking at the ONA Daily Prep Sheet.  Oh, no, where is that buffoon?  Where is that corn ball?  Ben, really.  Ben, I want to make a motion that we take Ben's hand,  and you ever see Escape from Alcatraz?  I want to see Doc do a little handiwork on Ben's fingers.  Here he comes.  It says, well, under the top, the heat is on, 
[00:37:30]  and then he played the Glenn Frey song.  It was a joke.  No, it wasn't.  Top daily headlines.  Idiots on Channel 5 said, the heat is on today.  I like the fact that it was a joke because it was disguised in an area  that had no humor value whatsoever.  Well, yes.  Yeah, Ben's smart.  Ben wrote, the heat is on.  New York City to reach close to 100 degrees today.  100.  But our real field temperature is over 100, Opie.  The fucking real feel.  Enough with the real feel.  The real feel is whatever the temperature is outside. 
[00:38:00]  Can we do something fun today for the heat?  Oh, what do you want to do?  I want parents who have locked a child in the car until it died.  Call in and tell us that story.  All right.  The heat is on.  Might as well play cocaine for Bin Laden while we're at it.  Yeah, the Bin Laden story.  Jesus.  What is the Bin Laden story all about?  Bin Laden coke plot.  Shortly after 9-11, Opie, Bin Laden hatched another plan. 
[00:38:30]  He wanted to get in bed there, get into cahoots with some drug dealers down in Colombia,  buy a bunch of cocaine, poison it, and then sell it around the country here.  Which, oh, did Ben suggest this?  Yes, you did.  Yes.  This is for the Bin Laden story.  Oh, I thought it was his wedding song.  I don't know what this would do to our grand country if you killed all the people doing coke. 
[00:39:00]  We might get guests, but...  Wouldn't most people say that drugs is affecting our country, so wouldn't this help us technically in the end?  Yeah.  And the odd thing is the plot never panned out because the drug dealers didn't want to hook up with Bin Laden.  So even they have some kind of morality and some kind of code.  With the Colombians and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah, they didn't want to hook up with that guy.  But he was prepared to buy a whole bunch of coke and ship it into the country, poisoned. 
[00:39:30]  But again, what would that do?  Ruin the drug trade?  30 stockbrokers?  Yeah.  What?  And it made the cover of the paper.  Bin Laden was in Boston doing coke and tom writing.  No.  Oh, well, the story about the payola?  Did you read that?  No.  There's radio stations that have been giving prizes and stuff.  They have been given prizes and money and other things to play artists' records to make them popular. 
[00:40:00]  It's called payola.  You're not allowed to do that.  And Ben was in there talking about how, I knew this months ago.  I heard from a guy at Sony and he told me that Ben just knew everything already.  Ben was like, they were confiscating their hard drives months ago at Sony.  At Sony, don't.  He knows every story he knows.  I know, Bin Laden coke.  Stop it.  That payola story is weird, though.  Yeah, it is a little odd.  It's really stupid. 
[00:40:30]  I understand payola for what it used to be.  It used to be that record guys, before it was even big record companies that owned everything,  they would come into radio stations where the jocks spun whatever they wanted  and give the DJ money to play a record.  And drugs and stuff.  Everything.  Pokers.  To play the record.  Because, you know, if it's played on the radio, it's going to get popular and it's going to sell.  So that's what they did.  And that was payola.  And some people got fined, convicted for it. 
[00:41:00]  And then, yeah, payola and plugola became illegal.  And if you were in radio, you had to sign a payola, plugola.  Right.  A little contract there.  I've signed a couple of those.  Basically saying you would not, you know, do any of that.  Accept gifts.  Accept gifts to play a record or what have you.  But, I mean, the practice still goes on.  It's business as usual.  They just got around the rules.  Yeah, but now they're saying that even the rules that they're playing by now aren't good.  The Celine Dion one, I guess a radio station, was given a bunch of trips out to Vegas to see Celine Dion to give away to their listeners. 
[00:41:30]  And they're saying in exchange for that, they played Celine's record.  Seems to me like if you're a rock station, you're not going to play Celine's record.  This station would be playing her record anyway.  And to get prizes to give to your listeners doesn't seem like payola to me, you know?  We've all heard on the radio.  Obviously, when a band's coming to town, you know, that station will play that band a little heavier than usual. 
[00:42:00]  And the band gives tickets to the station to give away to go to the show.  That's payola?  Well, the Celine Dion thing, it says,  Epic Records said it wouldn't give radio listeners free trips to Las Vegas unless the song was played in good time slots and not overnight.  Uh-huh.  So, basically, the record company goes to the radio station and goes,  Look, we've got trips to Vegas to see Celine Dion, but, you know, we don't want you burying this record in the overnight period. 
[00:42:30]  I guess the record was just awful.  So, if they just...  A song called I Drove All Night obviously wasn't a big hit.  I Drove All Night.  So, they already knew they had a stinker on their hands and they knew the radio stations were probably going to bury this record and said,  No, we'll give you trips to Las Vegas if you give us some good time slots for this record.  So, if they didn't say that, if they just gave them the trips and it was kind of known, you give a little wink maybe, then it would have been okay?  It was just the fact that they said, you're not getting the trips unless you do this? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, okay.  But is that...  That's against the law for the company to go, Look, we don't want to give you something to give away and then have you screw us when you play this.  Yeah, I guess it is illegal.  Wow.  For any kind of record place...  They don't want the record company to dictate where the song is played, how much it's played in exchange for gifts.  But that continues.  Oh, of course it does.  It's so obvious it continues.  Of course it does.  It's really obvious, you know, and then they'll do favors for the radio stations, you know, let's say... 
[00:43:30]  I'm trying to think of a really good artist, you know, an artist.  Basically, they'll give, like, I don't know, tickets to see Green Day, all sorts of trips and stuff, if this radio station will play some of their other artists from, you know, the company.  Oh, yeah, yeah, they do that, too.  They throw all that crap in, so.  John Mayer, Bigger Than My Body, was the song.  Columbia Records demanded more airplay in exchange for free trips for listeners. 
[00:44:00]  It seems like the listeners are getting the payola, though, instead of on-air staff and PDs and stuff.  Jennifer Lopez, the song I'm Real.  Epic Records flew a Buffalo radio programmer and a guest to New York City in exchange for adding the song to his playlist.  All right, that's a little payola.  Uh, Good Charlotte song, Hold On.  Epic Records flew the same Buffalo radio programmer to Fort Lauderdale in exchange for adding the song.  Ooh, this guy is screwed. 
[00:44:30]  This guy was jet-setting all over America as he added songs to his playlist.  Does Ben know who it is?  We're trying to figure it out.  Ah, dude, I know the guy.  Uh, yeah, basically it's all about trips.  And they have a program director at WPXY in Rochester.  Yeah.  I think that's, uh, that McRae fella.  McRae?  That was a nightmare when we were syndicated to Rochester.  This scumbag.  Oh, right, I remember.  That got fired and there was a huge article in New York Times about him.  He claimed that he was playing our show in syndication and wasn't fucking with it. 
[00:45:00]  And we would get emails from listeners all the time saying, dude, they're not running this show.  They're running an old show.  They're running part of the show.  They're cutting it up with music.  And I would just, I would call this guy and confront him because back in the day, I was calling a lot of these PDs to see, you know, what was going on with our show in syndication.  And the freaking guy lying right to my face.  Yeah.  And he finally got caught because he was doing all sorts of crazy shit.  I don't know if it's this, I don't know if it's the same guy, but it says program director at WPXY in Rochester. 
[00:45:30]  I think he was overseeing that channel as well at the time.  Anyway, an email from this program director that says, I'm a whore this week.  What can I say?  Oof.  Because basically he was just, uh, you know, collecting all sorts of gifts and trips and, and concert tickets for, uh, adding records.  We know a couple of guys that were, uh, very wealthy, rolling in money and merchandise that they built from their, uh, their empire as a program director. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's been going on forever.  So, Elliot Spitzer is on the case.  That Elliot Spitzer.  He's the.  What a buddinski he is.  He's a buzzkill.  What a nosy bastard.  Keep your nose out of it.  If you're up to no good, Elliot Spitzer will find out, that's for sure.  You don't want Elliot Spitzer on your tail.  Oh, my God.  He's going to confiscate your hard drive, dude.  Your worst nightmare.  Phone call.  Elliot Spitzer on line four.  Oh, no. 
[00:46:30]  Not Elliot Spitzer.  That guy really does stink.  And it's always things that, it doesn't affect anybody.  It's not that, like, the public is getting screwed on these things.  But Elliot Spitzer always jumps in there.  It's stupid.  It's pay all and plug all the thing.  Because, you know, if a station is getting really stupid and adding records that are really bad  and, let's say, moving that Celine Dion song into better time slots to get trips to Vegas and stuff,  you do enough of that, the ratings of the station are going to go down.  Right. 
[00:47:00]  Because you're not programming the best stuff.  And then you're going to be affected no matter what.  Yeah.  So it's a very sensitive balancing thing that these radio stations have been doing forever.  Is it that important that Elliot Spitzer has to get involved, though?  No.  Who's the victim in this is what I want to know.  Who is the victim?  You've got to have a victim.  Who is the victim?  Where is the bad thing happening that Elliot Spitzer, who is supposed to protect, you know, the public interest,  who's getting screwed here? 
[00:47:30]  Is it a band that's really good that isn't getting played?  Who's getting screwed here?  I can't figure it out.  It's hard.  I believe you.  I tried to get trinkets I own made from gorilla hands played on that station, and they were unable to.  So I may have a little lawsuit pending.  Ah.  How about a little blow Ola?  Go over there.  Pay off Ola.  Right in the face.  Yeah, I really don't know the answer to that question.  You know, we should try to get Lee Abrams on the phone today.  Yeah, he's a legend in radio. 
[00:48:00]  He could tell you some stories of some real plug Ola and pay Ola.  Oh, my God.  Probably could tell stories about receiving cocaine.  Oh, I'm sure.  To play Buddy Holly records.  Jeez.  How old are you making this guy?  I don't know, but he's a legend.  He would probably have some good insight into this whole pay Ola and plug Ola thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right, though.  Who is the victim?  Who is the victim here?  The record company is getting something.  The air staff is getting something. 
[00:48:30]  The artist is getting something.  I don't understand why he's jumping in to protect somebody.  Foundry Music Dan writes, they claim the victim is the listener because the good music isn't being played.  The record company.  That's the point I'm making.  If the good music isn't being played to a point, the ratings will go down and then that station will go away.  And regardless of if they're getting paid or not, it's the radio station's decision what they play anyway.  It's not like if we don't play this pay Ola song, we're going to play this guy. 
[00:49:00]  Or, wow, there's not enough room.  Well, you make room because this guy wants his record played.  It doesn't work like that.  They play whatever they want.  And if they're making, you know, getting a few trips for listeners or getting a free trip for their PD to go somewhere, who cares?  Yeah, I agree.  Joe in New Jersey.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I was just going to say, you know, we've got subways blowing up around the world, and the government has nothing better to do than this pay Ola thing. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, maybe we ought to do a little triage here, and maybe they ought to look around and see what's really important and what technically is illegal but really isn't affecting people that greatly here, like this pay Ola thing.  And maybe concentrate some of your efforts on, yeah, security and subway safety.  There you have it.  That's why I hate the FCC.  Well, this one has nothing to do with the FCC, I guess, right? 
[00:50:00]  We should list all the other things Elliot Spitzer has gone after.  The laundry list is pretty impressive.  And what else is he?  It's always some little thing you never thought of.  What a budinsky.  A guy that, like, you got something good going, you and your little group.  You got something that's working.  Everyone's happy in this situation.  And then Elliot Spitzer, Lion 3.  Oh, no, what did I do?  You never want the call from Elliot.  Let's go to John in Maryland.  John, what's up?  Hey, man.  And really, the victim is the smaller bands and the smaller labels. 
[00:50:30]  And Anthony, you should know with your brother and stuff.  That's a real pain in the ass when you've got the bigger companies hogging up all the time unfairly.  And you don't have money, but you have good songs.  It has nothing to do with the payola, though, why you can't get airplay.  It has nothing to do with payola.  You're a small independent band.  You're trying to get airplay.  It's almost impossible.  But that has nothing to do with payola.  You don't think it's unfair for smaller bands who don't have the ability to do that?  That that's not the unfair part? 
[00:51:00]  Everyone isn't getting payola.  It's part of the bigger picture.  And the bigger picture is it's almost impossible for an independent band to get airplay.  Because of just the way it is with record companies and radio stations.  You can't just walk in.  Whether they're getting payola or not.  At the cleanest station in the fucking world that's never accepted payola, you try walking in there with your little record and say,  Could you play this?  They're going to say, No, that's just the way it is.  I think payola is a great excuse to say, Well, because they're taking money from the record company. 
[00:51:30]  Man.  No.  It's just the way it is.  They don't want to play it.  It's unproven.  They test records.  They analyze it with a slide rule, and then they play it.  Doesn't it seem like it'll be easier to get it played with payola?  Well, like if someone on the independent label has something to give the station, they might get played a little faster.  Exactly.  And as a matter of fact, there was this controversial thing that was happening a while back where you actually bought airtime to get your song played.  Independent guys were doing this. 
[00:52:00]  They would go to a radio station, buy a spot of time like a commercial, which you could do, and then play the song in that commercial spot.  So now the station's playing your song, and you paid them to play it.  I just shut myself off.  Anthony, where are you?  You know what I want to do?  I want to move this fucking button.  You said that months ago.  I want to move the on-off button so it's over here somewhere.  There's no reason my on-off button has to be right where my newspapers are.  When you get ranting and raving there, you turn your mic off. 
[00:52:30]  Because I start wailing my arms around.  But that was a big controversial thing because it was, again, you're accepting, the station was accepting money to play a song.  Ben brings up a good point.  Stop it.  He does not.  And I was thinking this is how Limp Bizkit got big, but I wasn't sure.  But I think back in the day, I think that's exactly what we did with Limp Bizkit at WAF.  Yes, we did.  We were playing paid spots, and the paid spot was the Limp Bizkit song or part of the Limp Bizkit song.  Now, the station's making money. 
[00:53:00]  It's no different than a record company coming in and handing the station money because through advertising, that's how a station makes its money, and they were being paid to play a song.  But they said it was, they were buying airtime.  What's, how can you dictate what people put in a section of airtime that they bought, whether it's a commercial for a hemorrhoid cream or a fucking song?  And that was a little odd.  I think that's how Limp Bizkit first started getting big.  Yeah, with a lot of stations. 
[00:53:30]  Isn't advertising technically payola?  Like, hey, we'll give you this money.  Exactly.  And you pretend this dog shit product is worth something.  And they say, I want this played at such and such a time.  I like my dick creams.  They have to pay a higher rate for a better time slot.  So what is the difference between just paid advertising and payola?  Absolutely.  Elliot Spitzer.  Indeed.  Indeed.  All right.  Oh, yes, I just got a text message from Elo. 
[00:54:00]  Unsigned bands, alive and well, on XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, right.  What's the, what's the channel?  I forgot the channel name.  Elo, you got to add the channel in.  But basically, it's a channel on XM that is dedicated to bands that aren't signed yet.  Independent bands.  Independent bands, man.  Man, that station's so hip.  And another reason why Satellite Radio is that much better than commercial radio, because  they are playing a lot more bands than commercial radio and giving a lot of bands a chance that  wouldn't have a chance on commercial radio. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  It's XM 52, yes.  The unsigned channel.  For a while, I don't know if the grease man is still doing it, but he would, his whole show  was based on paying the station.  Like, he would go in, buy time on a station like you would just buy four hours worth of  commercial time.  And then he would do his show, but he'd go out and sell advertising time to play on  his show to pay back the station.  So he was like subletting the airtime on the station. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know if he still does that or not.  What a nightmare to have to go through.  I don't see a lot of people think we, we fucked up our radio careers and we, we did a pretty  good job.  I got, I got to admit, but we were in demand when we did it, which is the big difference.  We were riding high, very popular with very good ratings when we did it.  So when it came time to come back, there was a demand for us.  With grease man, he fucked up when he just had no ratings.  No one really cared.  No one was listening.  So nobody wanted to have him back. 
[00:55:30]  And this douchebag was all over CNN and the rest of those channels, you know, just killing  us.  Well, they crossed the line there.  Just killing us.  What?  He was the radio expert that they found when we fucked up.  Yeah, they dredged up the grease man to just bash us on the air.  You know how disheartening it is to sit there after you've been fired, turn on the TV and  see the likes of the grease man bashing you?  They went, it should have never taken place in a church yet.  Just goof on the Negroes like the grease man. 
[00:56:00]  I'm sitting there going, does the guy interviewing grease man realize what he did wrong?  No wonder they dragged them behind trucks.  Ouch.  But he's telling us we went too far.  Too far.  Too far.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  That's what he was doing.  He would sell, you know, he would be doing his show.  Grease man, Ellie, we were slinging lead.  And if you're hungry from slinging lead, go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken at the corner  of 5th and 3rd.  Yeah, doodle-y. 
[00:56:30]  Is that the big announcement that the grease man's going to be here?  Ah, you wrecked it.  Of course.  Shut up with the big announcement.  That's all we can say for now.  What?  Mike and Marilyn, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  Good.  Here's the difference between the payola and the advertising.  All right, smarty pants.  Why don't you tell us?  All right.  Basically, well, at least in my opinion, I think the rest of the station is jealous of the PD  or whoever's getting the money, the trips or whatever, because that's one person getting 
[00:57:00]  the money for it, as opposed to the station making money off of an advertising spot.  You know, if someone's going to pay an X amount of money on a commercial...  I got you, instead of somebody just personally making money here.  Exactly.  That's the difference.  Yeah.  That's the difference.  All right.  All righty.  We're trying to find the audio of the grease man just killing us on...  Oh, yeah.  I think it was on Fox News Channel.  This fucking ass.  Grease man.  All right, we should take another break. 
[00:57:30]  I think we're going to take shorter breaks today for all those my fires out there listening  to the show.  Donkey Sausage had an assault on the media, by the way.  I guess we could talk about that and where we stand with the assault on the media contest  after these paid announcements.  What?  No.  No, they're promos for other channels on XMAC.  Of course they are.  I think that's all we have to worry about here on Satellite Radio.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Ooh!  Ooh!  Wow, that's really nice. 
[00:58:30]  What, what, what?  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to die against the divas.  I'm on divas.  I'm on Starbucks coffee.  I'm everywhere.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  Is that amazing though? 
[00:59:00]  That is hysterically funny.  Don't worry.  It all will make sense in the end.  Right.  We always wrap these little teasers up nicely.  No surprise though, right?  Right.  None whatsoever.  Eric is running around.  We see you, Voss, but you have nothing to add, so just sit there and drink your coffee.  Unsigned 52, Opie.  I'm screaming.  We'll get to you in a minute.  Relax.  Have your coffee.  Ben came in three times. 
[00:59:30]  Voss is here.  No one's acknowledging that we heard Ben, but we heard Ben.  We know.  We're trying to do some more radio before we move on to Voss, because then it just gets  into the silly zone.  Unsigned 52.  That's the channel for you people that want unsigned bands.  You're kidding, right?  Yeah.  That's it.  It was on instant feedback.  I didn't know.  Derek, you're with me, right?  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Wow.  I was announcing it.  Are we doing that segment on the show, hopefully?  Yes, they're writing it down. 
[01:00:00]  Thank God.  I figured if somebody wanted to know.  Did you do that on purpose?  No.  I figured if somebody wanted to know, they would now.  We don't listen.  No.  It was announced already.  Are you fucking with me?  I don't know.  I swear I didn't hear it.  You said it?  Yes.  With the air, Jimmy.  Yes.  The whole room is like going, wow.  Because that was an obvious one.  Unsigned 52, people.  That was an obvious one.  I don't listen.  We know we don't listen.  But we've got to do a better job at listening to each other. 
[01:00:30]  No, we don't.  We all have very interesting things to say on this program.  If we just open our ears a little bit.  What?  Sometimes I listen to this show on my Wi-Fi, and I say to myself, was I even there?  I know.  See?  Was I even there?  I know at times I'll turn my mic off, and I'll start talking to Eric to set up things.  So I know flat out that I'm going to miss the 30 seconds to a minute of the program,  whatever.  Yeah.  But then there are times I'm like, I'm even laughing and commenting.  Like, I don't remember this. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  I read a lot of instant feedback.  That's my job on this show.  When people are talking, I'll listen to the conversation.  But a lot of times I'm scrolling through the instant feedback, and I may miss something that's said.  For instance, I missed something I caught on the replay yesterday when I was outside the studio.  Yeah.  Jimmy doesn't, what's he doing for four hours?  This is my most important thing.  I was gone for two tools.  I was gone for 30 seconds. 
[01:01:30]  I totally hung you out to dry while you went out of the room.  I was just answering an email.  Well, we're in here working.  Where's Jimmy?  I said, we said you have a good, fine job on the show.  I agree.  You get to fall asleep when you want.  You can, like, go take care of other business while we're doing the show.  On the phone with Del.  No, I was answering an email, probably.  Something with maybe a pair of tits attached to it.  All right.  Me, I mean.  Let's say hi to Bill.  Bill, what's going on?  Bill Ward?  Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  How's it going? 
[01:02:00]  All right.  What's up, Bill?  Good, good.  Just wanted to tell you guys that Sandy Fox was on that comedy channel last night about  8 o'clock.  Just plugged the shit out of you guys.  Oh, Sandy Fox?  Oh, yeah.  Very cool.  And he also played about 15 minutes of Norton's Comedy, which I, you know, didn't get a chance  to hear any dirty stuff, you know, on Leno and stuff.  Very nice.  Definitely cool.  All right, cool.  Punch it out.  Thanks.  Thank you to Sandy Fox on XM 150.  Eric is out of the studio.  There's a whole, um, we were talking about Greaseman, and, uh, you know, Greaseman went 
[01:02:30]  on Fox News Channel to just, just kill us.  Yeah.  Just kill us when we got, uh, fired for that whole Sex for Sam thing at St. Pat's Cathedral.  One of the experts they dragged on.  And I'm looking at an 8-minute video clip of that whole thing going down.  We've, we never played this one.  We gotta play this one.  Yeah.  I think they're getting the audio for us right now.  Uh, there's me on camera.  There's Anthony looking very serious.  There's Bill O'Reilly.  Well, because we were on the Bill O'Reilly show during that clip. 
[01:03:00]  Right.  Which was very serious.  The corruption of the American youth, I believe, was his, uh, topic.  All right.  Well, as soon as we get the audio of this, we'll play it for you.  It's pretty funny, especially the Greaseman stuff.  Just, um, killing us.  Absolutely killing us.  Uh, Pat from Monaki wants to know if, uh, Voss has to hold the coffee cup with both of his little midget hands.  Should we invite him in, or should we have him sit there for a little while? 
[01:03:30]  I miss him.  I miss him at death.  All right.  Come on in.  Come on in, Rich.  All right, Voss.  Look at him.  Fuck you.  I don't need this.  Richard Jenny?  That's like...  I think you're over there.  Not that I have a problem with Voss.  I never have, and Voss has sat there a lot, but I think...  Isn't that the guest mic we've been using lately?  No.  Okay, then sit here.  Voss usually sits there.  All right.  Voss always sits there.  Voss, that's Voss's seat when he comes in.  What bothers you about Voss? 
[01:04:00]  Nothing at all.  I thought that mic was broken.  Well.  I know, I saw Jimmy last night, and he looks trimming down.  He looks great.  Isn't he losing weight and getting a little more fit?  Because he knows he's going to be on television.  He's going to be on HBO.  So he's kind of wanting to look a little nice.  Unfortunately, I can't shrink my neck.  That fat frog appendage will be sticking out.  There's no exercise for the neck?  Yeah, there is.  It's a rope, and you kick the stool out.  And you go, one, two, three, four. 
[01:04:30]  You would figure the back of your neck is strong.  That's just going to happen.  You're going to lose too much weight, and you're going to go, well, no, we hired, like,  a little chubby guy for you.  That's the character we have.  Yeah, right?  Well, who are you?  I'm sorry, you're too thin.  You don't understand, Rich.  You look good.  I'm trying, I'm a whole piece.  I want to be a sex symbol.  Ooh.  I want to be a teen idol, like, on the cover of Tiger Beat.  You're going to be on Tiger Beat and all those little teen magazines?  I want to be on the cover of Tiger Beat with, like, a white bathing trunks with the lining  torn out, nice and wet. 
[01:05:00]  How about the cover of Nambla Weekly?  I think that was necessary.  That was a good line.  I didn't hit the button.  Don't look at me.  All right, we have the Fox News Channel thing.  Okay.  I think I wanted the whole piece, but I don't know what Eric gave us, actually.  I think he only gave us...  I bet it's the wrong thing.  Well, because Eric doesn't really listen.  I go, is this the whole thing?  And he goes, yeah, this is part one.  Part two's coming.  But I already know it's not the whole thing. 
[01:05:30]  No?  I just know.  I'd give it a shot.  Because the whole piece is eight minutes long, and if this is part one of two parts,  then why is part one only a minute 20?  Oh, boy.  So that means there's...  This is a section of part one, probably featuring the Greaseman is what I'm assuming,  because that's what we were talking about.  The Greaseman going on TV and killing us after we did what we did.  Yeah.  Why don't we play the tape and see what he gave us, okay?  Mr. Track, you've been in...  Mr. Track?  I'm going to personally take care of this. 
[01:06:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  The room is just laughing.  The glass room is laughing.  Somebody just ran away.  No, Eric is in trouble.  One of the interns out there just ran away.  Just ran, because Eric is now in big trouble.  Opie actually walked out of the studio, and I'm not going to lie, to see that body,  that cock-of-the-walk strut, was kind of nice.  But...  Now, I guess, because it started with, Mr. Track is here, which means that it's only  the Greaseman piece, and I guess Opie wants the anchor, the setup, the whole piece on 
[01:06:30]  us, and Eric did not deliver that.  And right now, what's happening?  Ben is laughing.  Of course, there's a crisis.  I think that's what happened when Ben was a kid.  I think the neighbor would molest him, and he would just laugh his way through it.  So now, any time anyone else is in trouble, it's his natural reaction to just...  That's how he covers up the tears.  Cackling.  You know, the man across his feet would rub his hands.  I can't wait to get to that spark, boy.  They are just awful. 
[01:07:00]  Everyone that works here is just awful, because the second one of them gets in trouble, look  at the joy on everyone's face.  Travis is laughing.  Danny's got a smile ear to ear.  They are all just thrilled to death that somebody is at the receiving end of a lashing.  You people are despicable.  I didn't lash.  Why don't you just help out your fellow employees instead of laughing at their misfortunes? 
[01:07:30]  Fan, Danny, Travis.  Ew, there's white stuff on your apple?  Apple.  Ew, what is that?  Oh, my.  Oh, you were eating it.  What is it?  Let me see.  There's white, crusty stuff on the bottom of his apple.  I ate around the top.  I didn't see any of that.  Look at the bottom.  Look where you bit.  You ate some of it.  No, I didn't.  Right there.  Right there.  The big white spot by your tooth mark.  It's white and crusty.  Right there.  You didn't rub that on your back, did you?  What the fuck is this?  What is that? 
[01:08:00]  Where?  Oh, jeez.  Sam pulls on the mic.  The whole mic stand flies out of the console and falls down, and the room, again, laughing  their asses off.  This is a national talk show.  You know that, right?  They just get such pleasure and joy out of other people fucking up.  I'm not even kidding.  Yeah, he's not kidding.  I absolutely washed it.  Do you look at fruit when you buy it?  Does it come off when you rub it, Jimmy? 
[01:08:30]  No.  No, it's not.  It's just...  No, can it wash off?  I don't know.  My apple has lit of Vigo.  At this point, I would just be...  Lit of Vigo?  At this point, I would just be...  Vitiligo?  Oh, vitiligo?  Ding.  Get that one, Tham.  At this point, I would just be...  At this point, I would be buying my own fruit.  It's amazing.  But why don't you go to the supermarket and pick out all your fruit for yourself?  Because I see what happens when you buy your own fruit.  Your son drops his stupid gun while men are shooting you. 
[01:09:00]  But, I mean, I don't want the oranges anymore because they were awful every morning.  Do you just want an apple?  And now you've got some white...  Hold that up.  Let me see.  What the fuck is that?  Listen, I've got to interrupt you guys because we have a big star on the phone.  A big star.  Sean Hannity on Line 12.  Oh, big star, my foot.  Sean.  You know better than that.  Hey, Sean.  What's up, guys?  You do a national talk show just like we do, right?  I do a national...  And by the way, you guys are doing great.  I've read...  You guys, like, grow by a million a day.  It's unbelievable.  Well, we are growing by leaps and bounds. 
[01:09:30]  It is.  I've got XM in my brand new car.  I get to hear the show a lot.  Well, do you actually accomplish things on your talk show?  Because we certainly don't.  We're talking about apples and our interns screwing up  and our...  Oh, I hear you guys accomplishing things when I'm listening.  Yeah, you know, you go from topic A to the next topic.  The only thing you've really got to do is talk and fill some time at the end of the day.  And if you guys make people laugh and you often make me laugh,  then I think you've done your job.  But, Sean, you don't understand.  We do that... 
[01:10:00]  I'm going to turn you guys off, though, with my kid in the car this weekend.  Well, yeah, that's a good parent.  Very good.  What part of the show did you have to turn off?  The part where the F word was being played a lot.  Yeah, that's called every day.  Yeah.  Not every day, because I hear you guys.  And Sean's making history on his show on a daily basis.  The guests come on.  They reveal things that go into historic record.  And we sit here and talk about white stuff on Jimmy's apple.  Jesus Christ, some perspective.  And we're in Penthouse Magazine this month, Sean. 
[01:10:30]  Well, then you have a way of talking about relationships that, believe me,  Sean Hannity would never be able to match in his entire life.  I stick to actual topics that I know about.  Sean's in Time Magazine, and we're in Penthouse and Hustler.  Hey, Sean, just to embarrass you, I'll be honest.  All right, embarrass me.  I'm going to read the first paragraph.  Oh, don't read the first paragraph.  Come on, it's embarrassing.  The second one of our exclusive interview in Penthouse Magazine, the September 2005 issue.  We did make the cover, though, Sean. 
[01:11:00]  Did you guys make the cover of Penthouse?  Well, our names.  Our names.  You know, Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Not a sexy cover.  They're finally censor-free.  What's next?  Yeah.  Would you like to hear the first paragraph?  I was hoping you'd read it.  Oh, yeah, the second paragraph is just as good, Jimmy.  Is it?  I actually thought it was nice.  It's near the end of a typical Thursday show for Opie, real name Greg Hughes, and Anthony,  last name Kumia, at their new XM Studios located near Central Park in New York City.  The guys and their sidekick Jim Norton are on the air listening to call-in guests, wheelchair  Fred, report the day's news from his bathtub as he inserts a dildo into his ass. 
[01:11:30]  And the FCC can do nothing but sit back and listen with them.  Great.  Sean.  I have no doubt it's being pumped right into the FCC.  Sean, who do you have on your show?  Do you have an actual news guy?  Because that's what we do with the news.  Yeah, my news is just slightly different.  A little bit.  A little bit more issue-oriented.  Might be talking about Supreme Court nominees.  I talk about things that I know about. 
[01:12:00]  That would not be a topic that I could relate to.  You know, I've been married.  You guys need to get married.  That'll change your perspective.  Oh, I will.  Anthony, you tried it.  I tried.  I tried for nine years, Sean.  But you know what?  You didn't marry the right woman.  Oh, that's for sure.  Because I have friends of mine that are in horrible marriages, and I look at them, and  I'm like, you know they didn't marry the right person.  I'm pretty lucky I married the right person.  Yeah.  Lucky you.  You married the right one.  Well, Anthony's been married, and it turns out the girl I wanted to marry, they would only 
[01:12:30]  let us get married in Massachusetts.  You know, you've got to check certain things.  Big back gal, was she?  That's a critical topic for me this afternoon.  Hang on, let me write that down.  Yeah.  Hey, Sean, are you proud of us when we talk politics on this show?  You know what?  I am proud of you, and whenever I'm on your show, and very early somebody's going to come  up to me and say, well, what are you on with those guys for?  And I said, because they're nice guys, and I get along with them.  Yeah, it's really weird, because we come from totally different, well, we come from  sides.  I think we come from similar backgrounds, and we have similar backgrounds in terms of where 
[01:13:00]  we were raised.  Yeah.  We're almost the same age.  You know, you guys talk a lot about sex topics.  I stick to things that I know about, which is politics.  Well, that's a misconception.  We don't talk about sex as much as we used to.  You talk about...  We still do, I mean, because, you know, we know that it should be a part of the show,  but, yeah, we were talking about Hillary Clinton last week, and how she's trying to get all  the violent video games off the shelves, because that's so important right now.  Isn't that a waste of time? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, the adult-only rating that they put on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas after it had  an M rating, which is 17.  Yeah, I actually played that game.  I like it a lot, but I wouldn't let my kid play it.  There you go, again, just parenting.  Well, it's just parenting.  For example, when I was listening to you guys, and it wasn't last weekend, it was like  the weekend before, on XM, and it was getting a little risque in the talk, and I just turned  it down, and then it was getting worse and worse, and then I had to turn it off.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Then I had to sell my car.  Then I had to sell my car and take 202 off the channel.  Yeah.  But you know something?  When I tune into you guys, it's usually I hear you guys late at night when I'm driving  home from Fox, and I listen to you guys because the show's funny, you guys have a great sense  of humor, you guys are having fun on the air, and I totally expect that it is going to be  an adult show.  Yeah.  I go to R-rated movies, and I wouldn't take my kid to an R-rated movie. 
[01:14:30]  I have probably every movie channel that's out there because I have DirecTV.  I don't let my kids watch those channels that I don't want them to see.  They like SpongeBob SquarePants anyway, so I think it's really up to the adult and the  parent in particular to choose the material that's appropriate for their kids.  I'm pretty libertarian when it comes to things like that.  I think you guys on the radio should have some latitude to create what you want to do  on the radio.  I think Satellite has given you a freedom that I don't think you ever imagined. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And you guys seem to be enjoying.  Yes, we are.  And the show is growing big time.  Hey, let me tell you one thing.  If I could just convert Opie into a Republican.  I don't think that's happening.  That ain't happening, right?  I don't think that's going to happen.  I'm a moderate.  What does a moderate mean?  I'm right in the middle.  I think both sides have some good ideas.  I think both parties need to get together and work together. 
[01:15:30]  If XM gives you a check for $100,000, because you guys get paid, according to the papers,  a lot of money, and when you get that check, you only get $51,000.  Yeah.  You don't look at that check and think that I pay too much money in taxes.  Absolutely.  And Opie has to deal with that every week.  What a problem.  I don't know.  You should see how I live.  It's ridiculous.  I guess I have enough money.  I don't know.  I don't like the taxes. 
[01:16:00]  I don't like the amount of taxes.  But I didn't like them when I was pulling in $35,000 a year.  I didn't like it either.  I was with you.  I started in radio.  I was making $19,000 a year.  Wow.  Yeah.  I started at $14,000.  $14,000 a year to do overnights.  Well, you know what?  We've all been pretty lucky.  Yeah.  And you get raked on the taxes.  I'm not a big fan of that.  And then the more money you make, for some reason, they feel that if you achieve the American dream and become successful, that you ought to be penalized for that. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  They're entitled to it.  I don't know anybody that's successful.  I don't care if you're in radio or any business that you're in, that you don't work really, really hard, devote your entire life to what you do.  I remember, Anthony, you probably forget, you told me that you and Opie used to talk when you guys were in radio limbo land there for a while.  That you guys would do a show for each other every day.  It was pretty much on the phone, you know, going over the news and just kind of keeping it together, you know? 
[01:17:00]  Well, that means that you guys are really dedicated to what you're doing.  Unlike Jimmy Norton.  This is what your real passion is.  And so if you end up being successful at it and you take some risks and you're edgy on the radio and you risk being fired on the radio, and then, say, you start making money, why does the government get half of what you earned?  Yeah.  How about 20%?  25% is fine.  They're like a mob partner.  They're in with a 50% cut.  You can't get out.  And they're in for 50%.  And what was Forbes who wanted to do a 17% across-the-board tax for everybody? 
[01:17:30]  There's two books out.  Forbes' book is just out.  Neil Bortz is a buddy of mine.  He's writing a book that's going to be out next Monday.  And it's about the flat tax.  Yeah, they average about 17% or consumption tax.  Anything you buy, you'd pay that percentage in taxes.  And by the way, you'll never see this.  You will never, ever see it.  We cannot get these politicians together to come up with anything, never mind something that huge and that much of a change. 
[01:18:00]  It just can't happen.  I don't think you will either.  I really don't.  And you know what the best part of this conversation is, Sean, is that Rich Voss is in studio and his hands are folded right now because he's realizing how dumb he really is.  No.  And he has nothing to contribute to this.  I have no idea how much I love Hannity.  I know you love Hannity.  And I wanted to talk and I want to ask him stuff, but this is, you know, I don't want to step on O.B. and Anthony's.  No, you don't.  You don't want to ask him a dumb question.  Hey, Sean, are you ready for a dumb question from Rich Voss?  No, I am.  Fire away.  He's a big fan of yours.  No joking.  What gets me is every time Sean goes on a show, somebody attacks him, blindside attacks him like Rosie or something. 
[01:18:30]  And he invites her on his show and she never shows up and it just pisses me off.  Did you guys see that when Rosie attacked me on the view?  It's just, it's ridiculous.  Yeah, you're like the name that comes up when people are talking about Republicans.  Yeah, but you know how you guys have misunderstood.  Sure.  You were surprised, both of you, when I knew a lot about you and your career and I had said from the very beginning, 
[01:19:00]  when you guys got in trouble in New York, that that should not have been a death sentence for your career.  Right.  And I think you guys appreciated that because there weren't a lot of people out there supporting you.  Right.  Yes.  And similarly, there are people that have no idea where I stand on any issue,  but they just assume just because he's a conservative and he likes George W. Bush that he must be evil.  Yeah, your name is like a catchphrase with these people.  They just lump it in with, you know, they go, oh, yeah, that Hannity type. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  You know, there are worse types.  I mean, I'm the type of guy that goes home, takes care of my family, you know, has a political passion,  and all I do is express an opinion.  Does parenting, instead of wanting to rip any type of adult-oriented entertainment off the view screen?  Well, that's true.  It seems like the left has been so spoiled when it comes to, at least the media, that, you know, Fox,  which is definitely, I think, a conservative bias, but the one media outlet on television that has, like,  a real conservative bias, everyone's like, ah, they're the conservatives. 
[01:20:00]  And meanwhile, CBS, NBC, CNN, every other news outlet leans to the left, and nobody ever considers them left-leaning because we're so used to it.  And in cable news, I can tell you that our competitors literally get no viewers ever.  They don't ever have anybody watching.  So then the question becomes, are the American people stupid, or have they made a wise decision?  In other words, what is the reason that they tune out CNN and MSNBC,  and I think they feel that there's an inherent built-in bias, and you can't fool them. 
[01:20:30]  People are pretty smart.  We think it's the panic mode that your Fox News does to the people, with the alerts and the fear.  Well, maybe the next time you guys are on, we'll do Fox News alert.  That goddamn Fox News alert every time.  Bong, Fox News alert.  What happened?  No street cleaning today.  Alternate side parking has been suspended.  Holy Jesus.  You guys scared the crap out of me over there, Fox. 
[01:21:00]  That sounded like a good idea at the time.  It's a good idea at the time.  And I think one of the reasons we feel like that, because I think in the back of all our minds,  we're just waiting for the next bomb to drop.  And, well, look what happened in London the last few days.  Well, I kind of want to get into that a little bit with you about the searches going on,  because the ACLU today has chimed in and said they are going to start challenging this random search.  And then they come up with no research whatsoever.  They say this will have no effect on terrorism. 
[01:21:30]  They just blurt it out.  The irrelevance of the ACLU has become so irrelevant in the last few years and such nitpicky.  All they do is argue slippery slope.  They have become a disgusting group.  Yeah.  Well, here's my take on it, because if you're dead, you don't have any liberty.  If you're afraid to board a subway, you're not free anymore.  Your liberty's been taken away from you.  If you have to change the manner in which you get to work because you're fearful of using public transportation, 
[01:22:00]  you don't have any liberty there either.  Yeah.  And, unfortunately, we live in a world where there are real scumbags out in the world  that would smile and be happy if they blew up a bomb in some place like Penn Station  and they were killing innocent men, women, and children.  Absolutely.  You've got to deal with it, and the only way I can think of that you can deal with it is  if you think people might be planning something like this or orchestrating something like this,  check their backpacks, check their bags, so that everybody else is safe. 
[01:22:30]  I mean, for those that have been arguing this is a bad idea,  well, I guess similarly they're going to argue that they don't want to get checked when they get in an airplane anymore.  Yeah, what's the difference?  I want to know that this guy sitting next to me had his bags checked.  Why is it when they're going after the mafia or they're going after people in the mob,  they don't do random searches in Brooklyn.  They monitor Italians.  They monitor, when they're looking for the Westies, they monitor Irish people.  You know who's involved with every organization, so why with this do we pretend that we don't know? 
[01:23:00]  And how come it's got to be so blatant where they go,  look, we are not profiling based on race?  One of the most asinine things I saw on TV, literally there were like seven grandmas in a row.  Oh, shit.  You know, 85-year-old women.  Stop it!  Stop searching the old women!  Stop searching, Grandma.  It's a waste of resources.  We had a guy on TV last night, and I said, isn't that a waste of time?  He goes, you never know, one day they might be able to recruit grandmas.  And I said, you've got to be kidding. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, that is very funny.  And this is just to appease the people that are going to chime in and say, look, they're profiling.  Well, why can't profiling be used?  If you choose between searching Opie and Anthony and an 85-year-old grandmother, I'm going after Anthony first.  Of course, me first.  He is a swarthy-looking individual.  Black hair and a ton.  Opie's got an all-American look, Anthony.  Yeah, I would agree wholeheartedly that I should be searched first. 
[01:24:00]  That's funny.  Hey, car chase on Fox News.  I'm looking at that.  It's a Fox News alert right now.  Yeah, no, let us in on something.  Do they still kill the people live on TV or no, or do they cut away?  You know what?  Actually, right now, they have a system where they go into delay for about seven seconds.  That stinks.  Yeah, I don't like that at all.  Because you don't get the payoff anymore.  I used to love watching these things.  You have to buy them on the best car chases.  Yeah, exactly.  Put out by Fox News.  God, Sean's watching Fox News around the clock, huh? 
[01:24:30]  You know I do.  I'm going to tell you, I'm very proud.  I never knew when I came up here.  We're now going to enter in October, I can't believe it or not, our 10th year on the air.  Wow.  On Hannity and Combs, and we're doing better than ever, and the channel is great.  I work for really wonderful people.  One thing that I know you guys would appreciate, in 10 years that I've worked there, I've never been told what to say, how to say it.  I've never been told what topics to do.  I mean, they really give you the ball, and they say, hey, go run, have fun.  Hey, you got Bill Hemmer coming over there, huh? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, Bill Hemmer's coming over.  I don't know him that well.  Oh, you don't?  He seems like a nice guy.  I thought he was pretty good during the, when we invaded Iraq.  I thought that was pretty good.  He was pretty good on CNN.  The young guy's a smart guy.  Oh, that's the guy CNN?  Used to be on CNN.  Let go?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He did his Pope coverage, too.  Did he do the Pope coverage?  Yeah, he was all over the Pope coverage.  Didn't see that.  What are you talking about today, Sean, on your show?  I'm going to talk about what we're talking about here, about searching bags and liberty and the ACLU saying you can't search bags. 
[01:25:30]  We're going to do a lot on that.  We've been following the Supreme Court nominee, John Roberts.  How do you think that'll go?  So far, it looks so good.  But, you know, we're actually at a point, politically speaking, where Democrats so hate Republicans that they'll do anything to stop this president.  Yeah.  So they're looking into this guy's background.  If he made out with a young girl when he was 12, they're going to find out about it.  And they're looking for any dirt, which, by the way, guarantees you two will never be appointed to the Supreme Court. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, we pretty much know that.  My fraternity brother has some film of me smoking a little dope.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And I don't do any drugs or anything anymore.  You don't want film of that, though.  But he has me taking a puff off a marijuana cigarette.  That's bad.  Sean, you could probably...  You could probably get a pretty good political career.  Huh?  There were rumors that back in your NAW days that there was a party there every day. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, but Anthony and I didn't...  Well, Anthony...  There were no drugs.  Anthony probably drank a 12-pack every day.  That was about it.  Well...  But, no, we didn't really...  We didn't do the drugs or anything.  You slowed down, Anthony, because of your health issues, right?  Oh, yeah, my health issues.  That's what it was.  You're working out.  You're staying in good shape.  Yeah.  You're eating right.  I'm nice and trim these days.  Finally stopped drinking.  I was a big fat oaf.  It was like the Opie and William Holden show for a while.  Oh, I know.  We went through...  We just got to realize it's time to maybe slow down on the drinking and smoking. 
[01:27:00]  We tell these stories on the air, and I just don't think the listeners truly believe what was going on back at NAW.  They were bringing in pallets of beer on a weekly basis.  We had three refrigerators dedicated to beer in our office.  It was unbelievable, because we had Sam Adams and Budweiser as huge sponsors, and they just kept bringing the beer in.  Just hammered.  And we were...  I can't tell you how much beer was being consumed during that show.  You know what's amazing, though? 
[01:27:30]  I mean, for all the...  You know, as soon as you guys got in trouble, though, everybody started headed for the hills.  Yep.  And yet, meanwhile, if you guys have three refrigerators full of beer, somebody's got to be standing by saying,  all right, somebody's got to be the adult here.  Well, the problem was the ratings were going through the roof, so the bosses were like, you know, keep up the good job, fellas.  They didn't want to say...  You guys like some scotch with that beer.  Yeah, pretty much.  Well, this is how bad it got.  We actually hired a bartender to come in on Fridays.  You did not. 
[01:28:00]  I swear to you.  And then we had the bartender brought in shot girls that would dress in little uniforms or little outfits, I should say.  They weren't like the girls that you'd stick in the barrel and pour stuff on, were they?  No, these were the ones we...  I happened to hear that show one day.  Yeah, that was a fun one.  These were the ones we respected.  And then finally, the boss came to us, and he didn't really know how to tell us, but he's like,  I think you guys might have gone a little too far with this bartender thing.  I'm like, oh, all right, all right, I'm sorry.  Boss, did you want to ask... 
[01:28:30]  Boss is really dying to talk to you and ask you a question, and he's just getting nervous.  His little hands get straight when he tries to be smart.  You really like Sean Hannity, huh, boss?  I'm a big fan.  He's great, he's great.  You know, people, every time you bring up his name, the first thing they bring up is racism or racism,  and they don't even listen.  They might hear one word.  They don't listen to the show.  And you know what?  Someone said, oh, he's a racist.  And I go, well, give me an example.  They never have an example.  And they go, well, what he was saying about Chris Rock hosting the Oscars.  I go, that was drudged.  It wasn't even Hannity.  So half of them never know what they're talking about. 
[01:29:00]  And it's just, I argue, until I turn blue in the face, it was pretty good.  That was a close one.  There's a point where, politically speaking, if people disagree with you, they want to send Karl Rove to jail even though he didn't do anything.  They don't like the fact that Karl Rove has been kicking their tail in winning elections.  So now they want to come up with a phony issue and put him in some type of legal jeopardy.  If politically you're out of power and you make any kind of money, you can guarantee that you will be audited.  Because that's now used as a weapon to put people in jail. 
[01:29:30]  I mean, this is America.  Martha Stewart, I never met her, don't have any like or dislike for her.  Right.  I mean, when we live in an America where they can't find her guilty of the actual crime,  but can find her guilty of covering up a crime that they can never find her guilty of?  Yeah, that's a little odd.  That's a little odd.  That's why we're just, whenever they bring up these, like they want to get these new laws or change things, 
[01:30:00]  you just laugh because they cannot get together with each other and make things work.  I don't think they ever will.  We still haven't closed our borders, for example.  You know, here we are in a post-9-11 world,  and we have people to the tune of 5 million people a year cross the border at Mexico.  And I'm somebody who supports legal immigration.  I don't care how many people we take in from around the world,  as long as we know who they are, we check them out,  we know that they want to be a part of our family,  and that they're not a part of some al-Qaeda terrorist network. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  Basic common sense.  But both parties are afraid to take on the issue  because they think it might affect a particular voting bloc.  And I'm thinking it's your job as a government official to keep the country safe first.  And it's clearly the most vulnerable area we have or susceptible area we have to attack  because if some guy crosses the border at Mexico  because he wants to get a job in Southern California,  and I can't blame him if he doesn't have any opportunity where he is,  but if he can do it at will and we can't stop him, 
[01:31:00]  how are we going to stop a guy with a suitcase-sized nuclear weapon  that wants to bring it to Los Angeles or San Diego or New York?  Really.  Right through Mexico.  Right through Mexico.  What exactly is this obsession we have in this country with multiculturalism  and force-feeding the idea that English shouldn't be the first language?  What is the problem?  Why will the left not relent at all?  Look, everybody's got their agenda.  Everybody, at the end of the day, when you look at politicians,  for example, they want your money so they can redistribute it 
[01:31:30]  and create government programs and create dependency,  so that keeps them in power.  I think at the end of the day, you always follow the money  and you always follow where the power is,  and then you'll find where they are like vultures,  you know, preying on anything they can prey on so that they can stay in their positions.  And has the ACLU, I'm sorry, which has the ACLU,  I know you'd be more than happy to have any of those guys on.  I doubt they'd come on your show.  I had one on TV last night, Norm Siegel of the New York Civil Liberties.  Oh, he's like the head, right?  Is there any, what kind of a solution do they offer? 
[01:32:00]  They say profiling based on any type of common sense is wrong.  What type of a solution do they offer?  Look, I didn't even get into profiling a particular...  Holy crap!  Oh my God, a cop car just drove into a building.  You saw that, John?  I just saw that.  Oh my God.  He disappeared like they do in cartoons.  Unbelievable.  This guy ought to just be shot the second he gets out of this car.  Oh, he made a mistake.  He didn't mean to.  They ought to just shoot this guy the second he gets out of the car.  It looked like he must have lost the steering or something. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, he drove straight into that wall and went right through it.  It looked like the wall was made out of like cardboard or something.  He went right...  I hope he's all right.  Now these cops have got to be pissed.  Now it's got to get a little more personal.  They should just beat this guy so he can make a million, two million dollars in a couple of years.  And you know, Anthony pointed out something really...  We didn't get into it on the show, but about the fact there was some black-on-black shooting  and the guy was out on like $25,000 bail.  What the hell? He shot three people.  Yeah, he shot three people in front of a club recently. 
[01:33:00]  I think it was in the Bronx.  And he gets out on $25,000 cash bail.  I guess his bail was $250,000, but $25,000 cash bail.  And then you get Fat Nick, who's a big, fat idiot.  But to hold him in there on no bail just because it's perceived as a race crime, a hate crime...  Do you know there's actually a school of thought, and we've argued this on TV,  where liberals say you shouldn't chase people that are running away from the cops?  Really?  Because it puts the rest of the community in danger. 
[01:33:30]  And I'm saying that's not going to stop high-speed chases  because every criminal will then know that all they've got to do is put their foot to the floor  and they'll get away with their crime.  Right.  It's an incentive now for them to run.  Yeah.  And I don't want to see the conservatives have full run of everything.  I mean, you have to have some kind of checks and balances.  No, we want full run of everything.  We want to take over.  I haven't had believe what's happened.  I haven't seen many logical solutions just coming from the left in a while.  I'm sure there's some good ideas, but I haven't seen anything but knee-jerk reactions.  They're pretty angry at Republicans, and I know they hate George W. Bush. 
[01:34:00]  They hate the fact that we went to war.  They hate the fact, you know, any time that anything goes wrong in the war,  they're quick to highlight it.  They never point out anything right that we've done.  I mean, they compare the troops at Gitmo.  I mean, here we give these guys at Gitmo the diet that they want that meets their religious requirements.  We give them Korans.  We give them exercise rooms.  We treat them in a multi-multi-million-dollar facility,  and basically they get treated better than any prisoner in the United States. 
[01:34:30]  Right.  And yet that's still not enough for liberals.  Not good enough.  When they compare it to Nazi Germany.  Compare it to Nazi Germany.  Say they're being tortured using the word torture.  That's fantastic.  I've been saying about our troops, but I just think, I don't think the strategy's working,  because the Democrats aren't winning anything right now.  And if they want to remain in power, they've got to figure out a way to offer some ideas that people like.  Republicans are tougher on national security.  They are bigger believers in homeland security. 
[01:35:00]  And they also believe that we're overtaxed, so they want to give you back more of your money.  So there is a plan there that people can buy into.  Well, people that say that, like, you know, I'm sure Islam, we all know Islam's a very peaceful religion,  but is there any explanation they give for why there were protests over the alleged ripping of the Koran,  and yet they don't say a word about Al-Zarqawi chopping people's heads off?  You know, for all the talk about what happened at Abu Ghraib, and look, it was wrong to put underwear on the heads of the prisoners.  Nobody went out there and said, hey, we need to do more of that.  We've got to put it in perspective, though. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  You know what?  Our prisoners have their heads chopped off.  And we've got to be able to use techniques.  If we capture an enemy combatant on the battlefield,  you've got to understand that these guys potentially have a lot of information about future attacks,  future plans, potentially where our troops may be in harm's way.  There's got to be some means, short of torture, to extract that information from them.  Right.  If you play loud music, for example, we could play Courtney Love for hour after hour. 
[01:36:00]  Now, that'd make me speak.  They'd call that torture.  I'd start singing like a bird.  That's how they got Noriega out of his compound.  They played Twisted Sister.  I think they played Twisted Sister.  They did.  That's how they got him.  The church finally gave him up.  They were like, enough.  No, the left says that that's a form of torture if you try and extract information out of them,  or if you sleep-deprive them, or if you make them stand on a box for an hour or two.  Somehow you're abusing their rights.  Somehow, when you just ask them nicely, they don't tend to give the answers. 
[01:36:30]  So other things have to be done.  And what if they know about an attack on a particular compound?  Look at that.  Another one went in, or that's a replay?  That's a replay.  That's a replay.  We're all watching.  We're all watching.  He's on the run.  He's on the run.  Shoot him.  This is the end of the car chase on Fox News Channel.  Shoot him.  We're not going to...  This guy, he literally smokes five packs a day.  He's not going very far.  Wow.  Yeah, he really is.  Oh, boy.  Who's the lucky...  Oh, no.  Don't lose the feed.  Oh, no.  All right.  We went to another camera. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, put your arms up.  Put your arms up.  Oh, they're going to be nice to this guy.  He's done.  Watch how they rough him up, though.  Lays down.  Okay.  Put your knee to his neck.  They ought to just beat the piss out of this guy.  I can't stand the fact that they can't tune up people on the street anymore.  I just hate that.  It's a good thing you're not a cop.  It is a good thing I'm not.  I take it so personally.  I just want them to beat this guy up.  Because he'll go to court, and the lawyer's going to argue, oh, this poor, deprived... 
[01:37:30]  You know, it's just such crap these days.  What happened to the old room?  You take the phone book, hit him in the body so you don't show any bruises on the face.  Right.  Good point.  The O.B. and Jim Crow show.  All right, Sean.  I'd like to have a disclaimer that I'm not responsible for anything that Anthony just said.  Of course.  I'm amazed we're friends.  Hey, guys.  It's great to talk to you.  All right.  So, Sean Hannity, you're on XM 124, the ABC channel there. 
[01:38:00]  From 3 to 6 p.m.  I'm not on a permanent loop like you guys, 24-7.  Only once, right?  Oh, we got a big announcement.  We're coming back to commercial radio, by the way.  When are you coming back?  And we're doing afternoons in New York City again.  Awesome.  Yeah, right.  Awesome.  You heard it in Sean's voice.  He went...  He always gets to me every time.  It's getting old.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I heard it in your voice.  He still got you a little bit.  Yeah, you always get me.  All right.  A friend of the show, Sean Hannity, 3 to 6 p.m. on the East Coast on XM 124.  Sean, thank you so much.  Have a good show today.  Take it easy, Sean. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  There you go.  Sean Hannity.  That was the greatest day of my life.  Why?  You sounded really smooth.  I have two good questions.  I just spit my stupid muffin in your face.  First of all, no, I brought up two good topics and he responded.  No, you didn't.  Here's what you did.  Polite Sean waited while you went through entire conversations you had with other people.  And I said, I like Hannity.  And he said, well, I don't like Hannity.  So I said, why don't you like Hannity?  It's like, can you just talk to Hannity and not relay that awful story to him?  No, not at all.  I was too nervous.  Like when I was...  As much as I hate Kubi, I go, if I ever see him, I'm going to go after him. 
[01:39:00]  And he was in like the front row at Caroline's and I froze.  Of course you did.  Of course.  Why don't we take a break?  We have that audio of the Greaseman.  Oh, cool.  That's what we were starting with here.  O&A and the Greaseman.  Actually, with Sean Hannity talking about our past and stuff, this would be a good segue  to get into that.  And also, I think we got the editor of Giant Magazine.  Yes.  Is that you?  All right.  We're going to get to you in about 10 minutes.  All right.  Remember the last guy they sent from Giant Magazine? 
[01:39:30]  No, I don't remember him at all.  I'm sure.  Even the editor is laughing.  Because supposedly...  That was their representative they sent last time.  Supposedly, they had a big laugh back at their headquarters.  He was quite possibly the worst guest we ever had.  I didn't know about Giant Magazine.  He was laying around.  I brought it home.  I really liked it a lot.  So we decided to get someone in from Giant Magazine.  Oh, they booked Danny Dull.  They sent a tool. 
[01:40:00]  We were asking him about movies because he was like a movie expert or something.  He hadn't seen them.  He didn't know much about them.  Didn't really give any insightful reviews on anything.  He couldn't wait to get out of the studio, remember?  Yeah, he was breathing all heavy.  He was nervous.  He was uncomfortable.  And then we went to commercial.  He ran out.  Ran out of the building.  We never saw anyone leave faster than that guy from Giant Magazine.  So...  Yeah.  The editor's here and he's laughing his ass off outside the studio because he thought  it was funny, too.  What's up, Ben?  Ben. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  That's the editor, right?  He's laughing his ass off.  Yeah.  Remember how awful the other guy was?  Horrible.  All right.  That's 28 minutes long.  We can't do that now.  28 minutes?  No.  Eric found the segment, but it's too long.  It's too long, Hawk.  Why don't we take a break and we'll continue.  Like suns through the hourglass, so is the only day of violence.  Hey, Clint.  Hey, I'm hoping I'm going to do some justice to Ben draw after the phone call.  It was great. 
[01:41:00]  He called in and I'm sure this is going to pick you two off.  They said, we're not worried about Opie and Anthony because they're only 145 pounds  apiece.  And if they come to O-Town, we'll whoop their ass.  Come to O-Town?  Let's not go to O-Town.  All right.  We'll be staying away from O-Town.  O-Town?  Ugh.  It's you.  What is it?  It doesn't pick you off.  I hope it didn't.  What, are they going to beat us up?  You guys suck.  Mr. O-Town? 
[01:41:30]  What the fuck's O-Town?  A hot group?  Damn.  I'm so sorry.  We're not huge, big, stereotypical, fat radio douchebags out at some shithole bar gig with  your gut hanging out.  Oh, that's the worst.  Just go to some shithole bar gig and sit there with your big belly, your big radio guy gut.  Bring it on, baddies.  Bring it on, baddies. 
[01:42:00]  Stop.  O-Town.  O-Town.  Oh, God.  Can you not try to come up with cool names for your fucking city?  Does that, please tell me that means Orlando.  I'm assuming.  Is that what you live?  It's fucking Disney World.  That's what Orlando is.  You can't be tough from O-Town when Disney's there.  That's what O-Town's known for.  Not for being O-Town.  For being the happiest fucking place on earth.  It's Disney World. 
[01:42:30]  Holy shit.  Are you going to sick the Mickey Mouse gang on us?  Watch it, man.  O-Town.  Yeah, their gang is real cool.  They wear the fucking Mickey Mouse ears down the street so they know they're badass in  O-Town.  You're talking to guys that are in New York fucking city right now.  Stop it.  We had a dodge gunfire just to get to work today.  Oh, please.  And you live in O-Town.  Shut the fuck up, fatty.  There are homeless guys on the sidewalk that try to eat your ankles when you walk past them. 
[01:43:00]  You got to watch from your feet up until the buildings up above your head when you  walk in and everything in between.  There could be an assault that comes on you at any second in New York City.  Not O-Town.  What's going to happen?  A kid let go of his Mickey balloon and he'll knock you on the head a few blocks away?  Are you kidding?  It's Orlando.  It's amusement parks.  It's roller coasters and fucking gay people in furry suits taking pictures with your kids. 
[01:43:30]  O-Town.  O-Town?  Bring it on, fatty.  Bring it on.  Tell them when they come down to O-Town.  Yeah, brother!  Stop it!  O-Town!  You have no idea who you're fucking with.  You have no fucking idea.  O-Town.  Welcome to the happiest place on Earth.  O-Town.  O-Town.  Irby and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[01:44:00]  Let's go to Chris from whackbag.com.  Chris, what's up?  O-N-A, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Listened into it for a long time.  Love you guys.  Little Jimmy, you're the best. 
[01:44:30]  Thanks, mister.  Yeah.  Plus, I got to call you out.  When you were talking about Chris Rock to Hannity, you called him Hagerty.  I didn't say Hagerty.  That's what...  You most certainly did.  I did not.  Check it on the replay.  Check it on the replay.  Can somebody go...  Hey, can I get a replay?  They can backtrack in there and check it.  Because if you said Hagerty, you're getting hot coffee all over your arm.  Okay, here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  If I didn't say Hagerty, right, you've got to write the nicest thing on whackbag about me, okay?  If I did say it...  I definitely will. 
[01:45:00]  Okay, if I did say it, then trash me like I did.  You are the best, though.  Huh?  You are the best.  I do like you.  But did I say Hagerty?  You probably did.  Not you.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  It was actually pretty riveting to me to go through the whole conversation that you had with someone else.  We have another Chris on the line from Orlando.  Do you have the balls to put me on?  Oh.  Reverse psychology.  Chris, what's up?  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Why are you saying do we have the...  You guys even took this call, man.  You'll probably dump on me because you can't handle the callers. 
[01:45:30]  Dude, please do me a favor.  Say what you've got to say.  It's cool.  But don't try that cheese dick psychology on us.  First of all, our dump doesn't even work.  I think we've tried to use it twice in the whole time we've been here, and it's never worked, sir.  What are you guys taking on the filming crew for, man?  We're talking, and you can talk, too.  What's that, Chris?  Why are you taking on the filming crew?  The what crew?  The what?  The filming file.  Why don't you just leave us alone and do your own show?  Filming?  Are you even saying it right, sir?  What?  What show are you talking about? 
[01:46:00]  You guys know what I'm talking about.  No, I don't.  I'm in O-Town.  Whatever you guys have been sending your stupid callers all week long.  You don't know what you're talking about.  You're not a fan of that show.  You just said it wrong.  I don't believe this guy.  I think you're trying to go, I gotcha.  Do you think so?  Yes.  You think you're so tough?  You know what's coming?  Yeah.  You come downtown to O-Town, Jimmy Newton, and we'll show you.  Jimmy Newton.  Jimmy Newton.  Jimmy Newton.  All right.  Now he's hysterically funny.  That's right.  Juice and I are touring together.  Jimmy Newton.  All right.  Thank you, Johnny, dude. 
[01:46:30]  Who are you related to?  Olivia Newton, John?  All right, Chris, thank you.  Why'd you have to spoil it with that awful one?  You wrecked it.  All right.  We'll let Chris go.  That was very funny.  Jimmy Newton.  Yeah, because Orlando is so tough.  In Giant Magazine.  Yep.  This month.  If you ever explain something like that to me again, I'll hit you with a newspaper.  Why does he always explain things to me?  Full Metal Redo.  20 years after shooting Kubrick's Vietnam epic, Matthew Modine is set to publish a Full Metal  Jacket Diary, a journal of his photos taken on the set. 
[01:47:00]  Modine gives an exclusive interview.  Oh, a preview of his book.  That's pretty cool.  Look at some of the pictures.  I like this.  They got a private pile.  Look at his big fat head.  I'm going to get that book.  Why don't we get Dove's friend, Tony, who I know casually in here, who had, again, the  second biggest speaking part in Full Metal Jacket and was cut out. 
[01:47:30]  He played a guy named Captain January.  I was talking to the guy.  How will you do the second biggest speaking part and then get cut out?  He explained the whole thing.  It's for real.  He explained the whole thing.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  What a stroke of bad luck that is.  I'm really going to suck.  Yeah, well, let's get him in to talk about it.  He had a real relationship with Kubrick.  He was great talking about it.  No, not the giant guy.  Jesus.  He got up off his chair.  We're talking about two different things.  Oh, the giant guy.  He's jumping the gun now.  Tell Mr. Joshua to settle down.  We'll get to him in a second.  We'll get to the editor of John Casey.  Your cigarette lighter.  Give me your cigarette lighter. 
[01:48:00]  We have to play something else first.  We've got the Fox News Channel thing.  We do.  It all makes sense.  Well, we went off on The Greaseman where he went on TV and just made fun of us.  Not made fun of us, but just killed us, even though he had his own controversy doing  his radio show.  I'll say.  So we're going to just play the clip of him, but then we found the whole piece that Fox  News Channel did on us when we screwed up when we were on regular radio, and I think  it's kind of fun to do.  We haven't done this one yet.  Right.  We like to go down this road from a ton of time.  So without further ado, let's get into the tape, okay? 
[01:48:30]  This was on Fox News Channel right around the time we were getting fired or were fired, and  then they dug up old clips of us from an old interview with Bill O'Reilly and re-edited  and all that shit.  Right.  Oh, wait a minute.  Another guy from Orlando calling in.  James, what's up, James?  Well, I know you're a bunch of faggons.  All right.  All right.  Faggons.  I'll tell you something else.  Uh-oh.  Jim Norton.  Yes.  You little faggon.  You come down here to Orlando. 
[01:49:00]  I dare you.  Well, he's been down there.  With a challenge like that, how do I resist?  Yeah.  Sir, you have some tough talk there.  You get enough.  Hold on, Vaughn.  Before he double dares me.  And you go on and on.  He just invited you to a city.  Are you inviting me to Disneyland, sir?  Because they have gay day?  Are you inviting me as your life partner to come down to Disney World?  Just come down here one time.  I dare you.  Well, if you get enough people after him, he might hit bonus at the club.  You come down here to Orlando, you little faggot.  Sir, such language.  I'd actually like to go back down to the improv.  I did it once. 
[01:49:30]  I didn't draw too well, so hopefully I'll get back down there after the show.  There you go.  There you go.  Yes, I know.  That's why I said it.  You didn't do too well, did you?  Well, all right.  Repeat any information you feel.  Or you could put it that way.  Yeah, I flew down.  Yeah, right.  You got to tell you something else about your call screener.  Yeah.  He was a total faggot.  You know what's funny?  I'm glad you mentioned that, sir, even though you're bombing on this awful call.  After we're done with you, I have to address one of the call screeners who tried to kind of cock block, which irritated me.  Well, he's probably like kin to you. 
[01:50:00]  My what?  Kin to me?  James, you did a pretty good job, all right?  Thank you.  We'll give you a C minus as far as trying to trash us.  Gee.  Gee.  I'll try better next time.  I double dare you, fella.  I know a friend of mine, a woman called up just to send me something for my birthday, and one of the stupid call screeners, cock blocker, is talking to her going, well, you don't even know him.  Why do you want to send him something?  Are you kidding?  And I'm like, and they're like, well, you're going to send me something?  What the?  Don't fucking, what are you doing? 
[01:50:30]  Who did that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  How do you know that happened?  She told me.  She told you?  She felt stupid.  She's like, I don't know.  I kind of felt stupid.  Oh, boy.  I don't think Danny would ever do that.  I exactly think he would.  You think Danny would?  Not to be malicious, but just to goof off.  I don't think Danny's mean-spirited.  I think he is.  I don't think Danny would do that.  I'd love to know who did that.  I'm thinking maybe someone that was sitting in for Danny.  Are we going to get honesty and somebody actually going to-  No, I was just on the phone just now, so I didn't even hear what Jimmy said.  Who was it?  I don't know if it was you, or it could be anybody. 
[01:51:00]  Who was it that when a girl called in to send me a birthday gift and asked for something,  said, well, you don't even know him.  Why do you want to send him a gift?  Like, who was that?  It was somebody from the show.  It was somebody who answered the phone.  Anyone?  I mean, I'm usually on the phone, honestly.  I don't remember saying it.  I don't see why I would.  But, I mean, so many phone calls come in, and I can't remember every one.  All right, if a girl called in reference to me, what would anybody say besides give them  the information?  You have the right number.  Well, I mean, it depends.  What is she asking?  If for the address, I would just give the person the address.  People ask for the address all the time.  Okay. 
[01:51:30]  I don't think Danny would do it.  I didn't say Danny did it.  I don't know who did it.  She didn't know.  All right.  All I know is this.  If anything that doesn't sound male calls in and has a question for me, be courteous, please.  Kind and courteous.  And very rare that that happens.  And if it sounds male, put them right through.  That's right.  All right.  If it sounds like it could be a gentleman in the address, well, just be understanding.  Let's play the tape from Fox News Channel.  There's going to be some fun to be had during this piece of audio.  Our top story tonight. 
[01:52:00]  Syndicated radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony, have been kicked off the air.  Yeah.  Fired over this sex stunt they pulled inside St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Last week, the duo broadcast an eyewitness account of a couple having sex inside the church.  And yesterday, they were officially canned.  Bill O'Reilly interviewed the pair recently, and they insisted they're careful to never cross the line.  Right.  Shut up. 
[01:52:30]  What an asshole.  Right.  Clorealizing douche.  Right.  Yeah.  Way to be unbiased.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Line.  Right.  Here is that never-before-seen interview.  The people you work for, the big operation, the big radio operation, do they care what you say on the air?  Oh, without a doubt.  We have due every day.  We have guidelines.  We have FCC, you know, rules we got to adhere to, and we do a very good job at that.  Well, you skirt it. 
[01:53:00]  You're smart.  Yes, you skirt it.  We're very smart.  We know where the line is, and we tiptoe on the line, of course.  We know at this point what our audience likes.  We know how to do it, and that's what we give.  Well, what do they like?  What do they want?  They like to be entertained, and traffic is like-  They like to-  Who's specific, though?  You just sit.  Wait, wait, wait.  You just sit.  Mm-hmm.  We know what our audience likes, and we give it to them.  I want specific-  He's trying to-  He's trying to, like, rope you.  Here's where he tries to trick you. 
[01:53:30]  Stop it.  Know what our audience likes, and we give it to them.  I want specifically what they like.  Okay, you know what men like?  No.  No, I'm talking about-  That's it.  Throw it right back in his face.  Yeah, I like it.  You know what men like, Bill?  Men like talking about things like fucking, and sports, and loofah sponges, and jerking  off with a producer on the phone.  Right.  They love doing that.  Right.  That's why this is so much fun to listen to after the fact.  My cock is so big, I want to rub it like a loofah sponge all over your face. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, way to get him, fella.  Talk about sex, talk about sports, talk about entertainment, hanging with their friends,  talk about TV shows, talk about sex.  No, there's sex in there, sure.  We wouldn't consider sex number one on our show.  No way.  No way.  Every time I turn in-  The media likes to-  Well, women.  Every time I turn in-  The program, there's a babe taking off her top, or there's a discussion of lesbians. 
[01:54:30]  Listen every day, Bill.  You see?  You see what I mean?  What?  Humorless jack-off.  He is an-  You see?  You see what I mean?  Yeah, you six-foot-eight jerk-off.  We understand what you mean.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  What a fucking tool.  This just enrages me.  You don't allegedly have phone sex with your-  My cock is so big.  Cohort.  Is it really?  A loofah sponge, you cornball.  A butt plug.  But we're bad news.  Did he say butt plug?  There was supposed to be a butt plug involved. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, how great is that?  Yes, correct.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Every time I tune in, there's a sexual theme.  I'm not hearing the ball scores.  If you took sex out of the Opie and Anthony show, you had a lot of dead air, you know what  I mean?  There's still drugs in rock and roll.  What a dick.  You know what I mean?  We have a lot of dead air, you know what I mean?  No, we don't.  We fill it up.  We fill it up.  Without any sex?  Sometimes we go weeks without doing anything. 
[01:55:30]  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I'm talking about on the air, not off the air.  No, on the air.  It goes in stages.  And we'll even check ourselves.  And I'll go to Ann.  We're getting a little too much sex on the show lately.  Let's back off.  This is easy.  Sex is easy.  You know it is.  You cannot be successful in this business just doing sex every day.  So, should the shock jocks have been fired for their latest stunt?  Joining us now are Bob Peters.  This is where it gets good with the Greaseman. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, here they go.  This is the Greaseman and some other expert that they found.  Latest stunt.  Joining us now are Bob Peters.  Bob's the president of Morality and Media.  And in Washington, Doug Tracht.  He's a radio talk show host.  He's known as the Greaseman.  Yeah, the Greaseman.  What, it'll take him five minutes to find experts?  Jesus.  The Greaseman is going to be the radio expert.  The guy that fucked up worse than anyone in radio.  Host.  He's known as the Greaseman.  Well, Mr. Peters, why don't you react to the decision to fire these guys? 
[01:56:30]  Well, I think it's great.  In two respects, I think they merited being fired.  They should have been fired a long time ago.  But, you know, I regard myself as a political conservative.  And I say, you know, one of the best ways to, you know, reduce the size of government is to reduce the need for it.  And corporations, even after a long delay, do the right thing.  There's less need for government.  So I'm glad Infinity Broadcasting, for once, has done the right thing.  Mr. Tracht, you've been caught in a situation where you've actually lost your job because of some things that you've said on the air. 
[01:57:00]  How do you feel about this decision affecting these two guys?  Well, when you think about it, with some of the stuff that's gone on in churches already, maybe they should be looking on the bright side.  At least the people in there were of age and heterosexual.  Look at me.  The pencil is in his mind.  Of age and heterosexual.  The fucking Greaseman.  I'm making fun easier. 
[01:57:30]  Let's go back to the Greaseman.  About this decision affecting these two guys.  Well, when you think about it, with some of the stuff that's gone on in churches already, maybe they should be looking on the bright side.  At least the people in there were of age and heterosexual.  We should fire some of the priests to get caught in having sex in church as fast as they fire these guys.  But when you hire a show like that...  Some of them may end up in jail, the priests.  Well, let's hope so.  That would be a great thing.  When you hire a show like this that's more based on stunts, pranks, going over the edge, this is the kind of thing that you have to watch out for. 
[01:58:00]  I try to do a show that I paint pictures, I use the language, I do words.  But if you have a show that's going to be, can you top this with the nearest naked man jumps into hot chocolate, somebody amputates testicles of a pig on the air for entertainment value,  you have to keep going to the next level and the next level and the next level.  And I think these guys were doing what they were paid to do.  It's like a wife that cooks and cleans and does everything for you.  She breaks wind in bed one night, boom, she's out of there.  The marriage is over.  I think these guys were doing what they got paid to do. 
[01:58:30]  And companies that hire this kind of show have to deal with the burning remnants of the air.  The burning remnants.  The burning remnants.  You know, you could actually commit someone with audio like that.  Against his will, you could have him committed to a mental institution.  He breaks wind in bed.  In bed, breaks wind.  By the way, the guy had no idea of what kind of show he did.  He had no clue.  Read a few headlines and just assumed that's what our show is all about all the time. 
[01:59:00]  What a buffoon.  What a dope.  Burning remnants of the aftermath.  Well, Mr. Peters, he makes in some sense a good point, which he says is that the management told him to do it.  Of course, if the management told me to do that kind of stuff, I wouldn't do it.  But does that then mean that the management itself ought to be held accountable, that perhaps their license suspended, their license revoked?  How do you feel about that?  Well, I tell you, I mean, my concern about a revocation is that the FCC simply has not been doing its job in terms of upholding the public interest standard for broadcasters. 
[01:59:30]  And then all of a sudden, literally probably out of decades of doing, taking no strong actions, suddenly they're going to try to revoke a license.  I mean, had the FCC been doing its job all along, in my opinion, this would have never happened.  But even if it had happened, in such a circumstance, the FCC would have been well within its rights, in my opinion, to pull the license.  Mr. Trax, these guys had a three-year, $30 million deal that they signed in June 2001. 
[02:00:00]  Where's my cut?  Wait a minute, what?  Where's my cut?  It wasn't that high.  You're $30 million?  Relax, Red.  Where's my...  It's only half that.  I think I have $15 million.  Three-year, $30 million, people.  That's it.  Yeah.  Supposedly, we were splitting $10 million a year.  Yeah.  $10 million.  Just more lies that the media just spews out. 
[02:00:30]  You guys wouldn't settle for that lowly, paltry sum.  Dollar deal that they signed in June 2001.  Now, these guys had been in Boston.  I understand they were in Boston.  I've been told that they were fired because on April Fool's Day,  they went on and said that the mayor had been shot and killed and they lost their jobs.  Then they come...  Wait, I never heard that.  Shot and killed?  This is Fox News Channel.  This guy is a dolt.  Just reporting the facts wrong.  Shot and killed.  Shot and killed?  Was he just reporting Menino was shot and killed? 
[02:01:00]  He should be fired.  It was a car accident.  Right.  Shot and killed.  Stop it.  Why is this guy allowed to broadcast?  And we said that there was a prostitute in the car.  Like, the whole story got ridiculous.  They never report on that.  Right.  That it was obviously a fake news story.  It was a fake news story because he was driving and there was a prostitute,  a young male prostitute, I think, in the car with him.  I don't know, something.  The story just got more and more ridiculous as the afternoon went on.  But now it's been reduced to that we told everyone that the mayor was shot and killed? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  You're on Fox News.  Where's the responsibility?  Because on April Fool's Day they went on and said that the mayor had been shot and killed  and they lost their jobs.  Then they come to New York and they sign a deal for $30 million.  Is it likely that, you know, after this they're going to go somewhere else and sign a bigger deal? 
[02:02:00]  That's great.  Should we answer that question?  We turned out just fine.  Well, yeah.  To answer your question, sir.  Let's face it, what they did was probably in bad taste.  And every now and then you can make a mistake on the air.  Lord knows I live in a glass house myself.  The deal is I don't think they'll come back with a major company right away because major  companies are afraid of protests and people wandering around and shareholders getting  nervous and stock prices going up and down. 
[02:02:30]  But I think in time, if they've learned from this brutal acid test of what works and what  doesn't work, they can find a local station with an owner with some guts and probably resurface  back to where they were.  A local station?  Yeah, we were going to do that, Grease, man.  But he actually wasn't that far off as far as a major company being so panic-stricken  with them worried about the protests.  Yeah.  And I remember somebody else had a local station suggestion, you guys got to move out to Seattle  and start a small market.  No.  It was all or nothing. 
[02:03:00]  It was either satellite radio.  Yeah, we weren't going back to a small market.  It was either satellite radio or a very, very, very big market.  Or I was just going to take my $15 million and leave.  Yeah.  I would have given you $15 million, but I forgot to put the paperwork through.  And by the way, major radio companies gave us a call immediately.  We were under contract with the stupid Infinity.  We couldn't do anything.  We couldn't take a job.  We were offered jobs.  We just couldn't take it.  Mr. Peters, what impact do you think this kind of radio has on young people? 
[02:03:30]  Well, I'm a media watcher, and I've got to know how many times over the last several years  I've seen articles specifically on the decline of civility in the United States in public life,  affecting people of all ages.  And I don't say I've never read an article where the impact of media hasn't been mentioned,  but it would be the exception.  I think most people attribute, at least to some extent, a decline in civility in public 
[02:04:00]  life, affecting people of all ages.  Now, if it can affect some of us adults...  Yeah, it's popular, isn't it?  It's hard to understand.  Well, you know, I live in New York City, and Howard Stern, to my knowledge, is the most  quote-unquote popular radio talk shows host in New York City.  But out of the people who are listening to radio in the New York City metro area, it's about  seven percent.  Ninety-three percent of radio listeners don't watch Howard Stern, listen to him, and I don't  listen to radio, so I don't even count. 
[02:04:30]  This track, very quickly, I want to give you the last word here.  Does this affect young people negatively?  Do you, why is it so popular?  I don't think it affects young people negatively.  I think negative young people are attracted to this.  I think nowadays you have people on the air who really necessarily can't create magic,  so they destroy.  They break things up.  And I think there's enough disenfranchised people.  If you look at some of the music videos, some of the junk that's out there where people  are throwing up and breaking things and smashing and dying in wrecks and dismembering themselves, 
[02:05:00]  I don't think this affects people.  I think it just draws the already offbeat crowd into a house in pain.  I want to thank you for both of you gentlemen for being with us.  This may be the beginning of a significant change on the radio.  We'll have to see.  And it was, by the way.  It kind of was.  It kind of was.  That's about three years ago.  That started the whole ball rolling.  And that was Greaseman's big moment in the sun.  And then, bye-bye.  Then he went back to his tiny, tiny little radio station in the middle of nowhere. 
[02:05:30]  Crowder.  To try to rebuild his radio career.  Yeah, but he wasn't really.  And he's still trying.  He wasn't really trashing you guys, though.  He could go fuck himself.  I don't like him either, myself.  He had no idea what we were about and what our show was about.  Why don't you stop, Rich?  It's great that they have those people come on and comment on stuff they really don't know anything about.  They just grabbed the Greaseman.  He had his big moment of the sun.  He thought it would lead to some bigger things for him.  Nah, he's still broadcasting to a tiny little station in the middle of the suburbs. 
[02:06:00]  No wonder they dragged them behind trucks here.  Where he has to sell his own advertisement for his radio show.  Let's hear what Vos Minnelli has to say.  That was obviously you were a big Greaseman fan.  No, I never heard the guy in my life, you know, but when he said it attracts, you know, negative type listeners and stuff, you know, I don't think he was attacking.  I think the other guy was real, you know, you know what I'm saying.  Yeah, of course we do.  No. 
[02:06:30]  No, we don't, Rich.  So we do.  Sometimes I don't articulate like I like to.  Yes.  It attracts negative people.  There are people that are completely normal that love this type of radio.  That's right.  That's a stupid, stupid comment.  Lad that decides he's going to kill his family.  Was it the church?  That's a good thing that he goes to.  Wholesome.  And he's killing people.  Things like that.  I can't remember his name.  But it was, you know, raised in a nice family.  Things like that. 
[02:07:00]  No evil.  No evil like these radio shows influencing them.  And bad people are just bad people.  I don't care.  It's not what they listen to.  I always say good people do good and bad people do bad.  That's what I always say.  That's a good thing to say, Jimmy.  I always say it a lot.  I always say it obsessively.  We're going to take a quick break.  And then we're going to get the editor of Giant Magazine in studio.  You're next, buddy.  Jamie Hooper.  Is that his name?  Are you coming in, Mr. Hooper?  Oh, Jamie Hooper.  Founder of Giant Magazine.  Oh, look at that. 
[02:07:30]  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got a break.  Ah, this is nice.  This is a story about a man  And he always was so lonely at night  But his voice is rowdy  You can hear it all through his train station  And I'm going to sing this one  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy 
[02:08:00]  Let's go  Oh, we go  Oh, we go  Oh, we go  Oh, we go  It's late at night  And now you have nowhere to go  Our money's gone and off  For all my friends  And the cop says to me  Hey, you smell bad  Get out of here  And he says  And you don't have an angel 
[02:08:30]  And he says  That ain't you  Shelter me from the falling rain  Hey, you have bones  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain  Shelter me  Shelter me from the falling rain 
[02:09:00]  You have bones  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain  That's just a little piece  Opian Anthony  XM202 
[02:09:30]  Alright, we're back with the Opian Anthony program  The ONA virus spreading across America  We had another assault on the media yesterday  It was great  I want to thank Donkey Sausage  She, I guess she went down to what  Madison Square Garden  They were talking about the hockey strike being over  Yeah  And they interviewed her about it  And as she's being interviewed  Another guy from Whackbag.com  Was just standing there 
[02:10:00]  It's your friend, right?  BJ  BJ?  BJ was standing there with his Opian Anthony t-shirt  Clear as day right next to Donkey Sausage  Oh yeah?  Was that an assault?  Yeah, it was a nice assault on the media  I don't think it's going to be good enough to win the prize for the month of July  Every month we're going to do this assault on the media  And the best one for the month will win some fine prizes  This month it's a MiFi and a day in the studio with the show  So you can check out Donkey Sausage and BJ  It's up on FoundryMusic.com and OpianAnthony.com 
[02:10:30]  Did you hear the audio of that?  Yeah  Did you get a Pat Battle reference in?  I think they cut it out though  Because here's the audio right here  It's going to be great  Nothing but fighting and beating the hell out of each other  It makes the game worthwhile  That was it?  That's it?  I heard that BJ has a huge hog too  That little bastard  He's a little minx  There you go  So they interviewed her about the hockey thing  And he's just standing right next to her with this weird look on his face  With his OpianAnthony t-shirt 
[02:11:00]  Nice  So we've got about four or five seconds of exposure  There's a real technique to interviewing people  Yeah, I hope you're good at it, Jimmy  It's going to be awful  You think so?  I'm going to be a floundering little fat  You'll do good  They're your heroes  We're going to have your interviews tomorrow for MozFest  So, how do you feel about the new project?  Cricket  Oh no  It's going to make Voss' Hannity interview look like a Barbara Walters special  Do you have a question list?  Yeah, I'm making some  Oh  Are you going to interview Rod? 
[02:11:30]  Are they good?  No  He doesn't talk to Dave Chevrolet  Are they good questions?  Not really  I have some for Bill, some for Tony, some for Geezer  And then some just Sabbath in general  Are these one-on-ones or are you going to sit with all of them at once?  We might be doing Geezer and Tony together  I don't know, I thought they were all individual  Being escorted  Sorry  You're going to be escorted to each one of their trailers individually  Because they have a little sequestered area behind OzFest  Bill Burr might be there as well  But I think it's just going to be you and me backstage 
[02:12:00]  With them  Yeah, because if it's  All right  If it's anybody backstage  Florentine has to get a photo with Geezer  But that's off the record  Holy shit  What?  It's already setting up the picture  I know  It's already setting up the photos  Isn't this a discussion you guys should have in the car down to OzFest?  It will be  Over and over and over again  No, but you understand  There's someone in L.A. listening to this  Going, who the fuck cares?  Exactly  Who's Geezer?  Forget it  Oh, no, Jimmy's mad  How much?  Are you mad? 
[02:12:30]  No  We don't talk about something else  Are you mad?  I'm sorry  No, I'm not  There's your little thing  I'm sorry  I can't wait  No, Jimmy's mad  I'm sorry  Go ahead  No, I'm sorry, Jimmy  That's interesting  Fair  Oh, no  Round two today  I want to hear  I'm just fucking with you  Now we do want to hear  I like the idea of Jimmy interviewing somebody  And are they going to give you a good thing to record this on? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, yeah  We'll be all set  We've got one of those mini-recorder says digital ones  Are you guaranteed interviews, by the way?  Yeah, they've been all set up in advance  We have so much help from the Jaeger people  From the Sanctuary people  But who are you guys guaranteed to talk to?  Guaranteed, absolutely  Zach Wilde, Geezer Butler, Tony Iommi  And what was the other one I said?  Bill Ward?  Bill Ward  Bill Ward  This is such a difficult thing to do  Like, to record an interview  It's different on the air  Because you know you're on the fly  It's live, it's gone  But to sit there and go 
[02:13:30]  Alright, I'm going to turn this on now  It's like, I am so frightened for you, Jimmy  It's like a very scary thing to do  I choke, I panic  Do you?  Yeah  And these guys don't really do these things  So I mean, it was a big deal to get Jimmy  You know, set aside  In their buses or trailers  You know, one-on-one with these guys  I think it's going to be great tomorrow  Could you see if it gets all screwed up  And you hear like  Alright  The tape recorder bumbling on the table  And you go  Alright, let me turn this on  Click  Alright, that was a great interview 
[02:14:00]  Thanks guys  And it's on when you think it's off  So you missed the entire thing  We will do dry runs  And it was great  Yeah  Please make sure he  Yeah  Not that I doubt your intelligence or anything, Jimmy  But as far as technical things go  And recording equipment  Are you writing out your questions?  Yeah, I got a few  A few written down  Can you read one of them?  They won't make any sense  What do you have big spaces?  Is that what I'm answering?  I love how confident he is  They won't make any sense  He's been preparing all morning  Just little ideas 
[02:14:30]  Little ideas  Come on, Jimmy  Can I suck your hog?  Check this box for Yex  I'm sorry, Jimmy  For Yex  You're already nerfed  I want to go on record  Without winking at Jimmy or anything  And I want to say that I'm sorry  Because I realize that it is a very big day for you today  No, you're not  And I downplayed it a little too much  It is a very big day  And I realize that from the look on your face  That you really wanted to smash me in  And I just want to clear the air  Before we go into a 45 minute nonsense argument  And I'll say in fairness 
[02:15:00]  Probably that the  And I didn't wink  Because Jimmy had to point that out one day  The Florentine remark  About how he needs a picture  Probably could have been settled in the car  On the way down  Opposed to in front of 50 states  That was probably a thought  I should have kept to myself  We'll be in the car for like an hour and a half  We can discuss all that  And we will  And I'll have to pull over and shit somewhere too  Because my body empties when I get nervous  Are you interviewing Jada Pinkett, they said?  Yeah, we got Jada Pinkett  You got Jada Pinkett?  Yeah, because  Who are you going to ask her?  I don't know  How big is Will's cock?  That's a good question  You're not going to get Jada Pinkett 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, she's going to be at the Jager booth today  They might get these people  Really?  And she tours with her whole family  So Will's going to be there too  Oh  Jim, you're going to record all the ugliness, right?  Because it'll be so much fun to see how you attempt to do this tomorrow  I'm not a bad interviewer  I panic  I can't do it  It's probably not one of your strengths, that's all  I'm abominable  I watched the Aussie interview again last night actually  Just for inspiration  And it was really cool  I feel confident sending Anthony down  Oh, no  I sat there just staring  No, no  You asked some very fun, little sensitive, fan-type questions 
[02:16:00]  All right  Very endearing  Voss, congrats to Voss and Bonnie on the show  What's that about?  Oh, we taped our pilot  And it tested well and everything  And it's up to one person now  Everybody loves it  Who?  Up to one  The head of Comedy Central  Doug Nozoggi  It's always got to go through him though  But everybody, it went real well  And Bonnie taped Letterman last night  She'll be on Friday  Friday on Letterman?  Nice  She killed  Really?  Six applause breaks 
[02:16:30]  You were there?  I was, of course  I'm always in the dressing room when she's on now  In the dressing room  I used to have, you know  But it was funny  Because I was standing outside  And I'm outside with her  And Eddie, who books the show  And going over and saying stuff  And the guy from Will and Grace  Comes walking up  Who was on the show last night  Which one?  Sean, is that his name?  I have no idea  The gay one  The real gay one  So he comes walking up  And Eddie says to her  I'll introduce you to him  He walks up  He comes up to me  He goes  Man, you're a funny guy  Really funny  He shakes my hand  And looks at Bonnie  And just keeps walking 
[02:17:00]  So now Bonnie's going to tell her  You know, he's telling everybody  He did the show with me  You know  I'm sure he's telling everybody  No, not everybody  But  He's told no one  Sean Hayes?  Yeah  That guy  Flamboyance guy  It was really funny  So watch it Friday night  Alright  Well, the pressure's on  We have to talk to Jamie Hooper  Founder of Giant Magazine  Let's bring him in  Because remember last time  A representative from Giant Magazine  Came over  It was a guy  What was he?  A writer?  He was the movie review guy  Look at that, Jamie  And it really 
[02:17:30]  Didn't go well  And Jimmy pointed out  That this is obviously  Much more important  Than him talking about us  So let's  Let's let the listeners  Be the judge  This could be awful  I mean  Oh, hi, Jimmy  No  He's right next to me  I didn't look up  He's not  They shut it off out there  So I didn't hear what you're saying  Did they?  Oh, really?  No, we didn't trash it too bad  You have XM at Giant Headquarters?  No  See, if you did  But we're working on it  Then you could go back there  And you could listen to your interview  Because this show plays all day long  Replays 
[02:18:00]  Replays  Now, the last representative  From Giant Magazine  What was his name?  Rich  Rich  Does he still have a job?  He does  He's a better writer than a talker, maybe  Wow  Maybe that's it  Did you get to hear his interview?  I didn't  You guys said you were going to send a tape  We didn't get one  Oh, really?  Oh, you know  I really wanted to hear it  To prepare for my  I don't know what to think of it  It was a really bad day  Did he come back and say it went well?  He did not  He did?  No, he didn't  Wow, he's a pretty honest person 
[02:18:30]  So he's honest?  No, he's honest  He's honest  He knew he was maybe a little stiff  A little stiff is the word for it  That's good  We found out that he was an expert on movies  So we're asking about all the movies that were coming out  And he was like, yeah, that's going to be a good one  Yeah, it wasn't very  That's about all he had  Remember Batman Returns?  And he said, yeah, it looks like this is going to be good  Yeah  There's really not much insight on his comments  Well, here's the thing, man  Sometimes guys that are really good at writing  Aren't that good at speaking  I'm better at speaking than writing 
[02:19:00]  Are you doing the Jim Gaffigan story?  The Jim Gaffigan story?  People say I look like him, so I don't know  That was a good one  Didn't just do that  Why?  He looks like him  A little bit  And this is radio  Nobody can see me  He's marking down his good lines and bad lines  Are you really?  Are you really?  I don't know who's keeping score  Because he's got four good and three bad  Be careful, that paper's going to tip over  You don't have four good lines today? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, I had four good lines  I had two right up front  Two right up front  Why are you keeping track of your lines?  Because, you know, I just get a lot of negative feedback  And I need something to fight  You know, I need proof  But why read all that stuff?  Because I'm lonely  All right  So Jamie, founder of Giant Magazine  I like the magazine  Good, thanks a lot, man  I said it to the last representative that was here  And then he didn't explain the magazine at all  No, really?  Oh man, I could tuck your ear off about it  Yeah  If you want 
[02:20:00]  Well, why don't you give us just a little overview  Why this magazine's different than the other ones  Because, I mean, let's be honest  There's a lot of these type of magazines out there  The men's magazines  Sure, sure  Well, the thing about Giant is  It's like  It's less about telling you how to get laid  And I know you guys like those kind of things  But, you know, it's a little less about that  And it's a lot more about entertainment  Just being the guy that  When you're with your friends  Sort of endlessly quoting movies like Spinal Tap  Or quoting, you know, Simpsons episodes  The Shining  The Shining  Or Full Metal Jacket 
[02:20:30]  We've got all the classics in here  We sort of  A magazine that knows that  The stuff that we grew up with  Is just important to us  As the stuff that's coming out next  You know  It's the stuff that we emotionally connect with  And we love  And just makes our conversations with each other  So  There's a lot of guys in here in suits  Yeah, well, you know  It's sort of  It's a fall issue  So we had to kind of take care of our fashion advertisers  Yeah  A little bit  But we got some cool guys in these clothes, though  Jeremy Piven  He was great  Eddie Griffin's funny  Will Arnett  You know, we do different 
[02:21:00]  Paul Dinella  Have you guys seen Strangers with Candy?  It's a fantastic show  What is that?  It was a show on Comedy Central  Only ran for two seasons  I remember that one  It had Amy Sedaris in it  Stephen Colbert  Stephen Colbert  Genius  Genius  Weird, weird show  And what happened to the show?  Well, they canceled it  But then they got funding to make a movie  David Letterman's company is producing their movie  Why did they cancel it?  Just not enough  The audience was just too small  Just wasn't there?  But it was really funny  It was just too smart  You know, it was just too good  That happens sometimes  A crowd  We've got Sarah Silverman here 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, she's  We wanted her in because of the aristocrats  And  Which is, you know  Comedians  You guys know all about the aristocrats, right?  No, they didn't ask me to do it  I didn't mean it  Oh, she didn't mean it  Honestly  Do you guys really know what the aristocrats thing is about, though?  Yeah  Is it something that does go on?  You want to explain the aristocrats?  Yeah, well, it's sort of like a  Mostly Friars Club comedians, you know  Sort of getting together and telling the dirtiest joke ever told 
[02:22:00]  And everyone's got a different version of it  It's about a family and showbiz  And they do depraved things to each other  And the jokes just go on and on and on  Sarah Silverman's one of these people  Get with Godfrey's and others  Get a lot of press for it  Otto and George  Did he?  Yeah, a lot  And the movie's coming out  And they're saying it's one of the dirtiest movies ever made  Yeah  As far as language and stuff goes  Oh, really?  And, yeah, it's getting a  It's getting a big-time buzz  It's big-time buzz  And the AMC theater chain is helping it a lot  Because they refuse to carry the movie  Yeah, but it has nothing  They're not carrying it because  Because of the language they want to carry? 
[02:22:30]  No, no  That's what they say  Yeah, that's what they say  But they're not going to air it  Because it's not going to make them money, they don't think  Because there's no big studio pushing it  Or a big director  So it's about money  It has nothing to do with language  So basically the movie's going to be  Just a bunch of comedians  Doing their version of the aristocrat's joke  Right, it's a documentary  Okay  And they pretty much try to top each other  On how they tell the joke  The more depraved the better  I think we're going to have the director in here  In a few days  Or maybe next week or something  To talk about it  Is it one joke?  It's one joke  It's one joke 
[02:23:00]  It's the joke  But it's how you tell it, I guess  It's how you describe  What the family's going to do  In this act or something  This vaudeville act, right?  And then the punchline is  What the director of the vaudevilles asks  What do you call your act or something?  Yeah  Right?  Yeah, and the punchline is  The aristocrats  That's the punchline  It's from the vaudeville days  So you were carrying that joke  Yeah  Well, they walk in  And the director or whoever  The producer of the show  Says, tell me about your family  And then  Then you go off 
[02:23:30]  And they talk about  How they have sex with each other  You let it rip  Yeah  You let it rip  You guys haven't done it, right?  No  Well, they already filmed it  No, I mean  They talk about this movie  Like comedians have been doing this  Behind the scenes forever  Have you guys ever gotten in a situation  Where you're retelling the aristocrats  Joke to each other?  Never  Never have we ever done that  I've never heard of that joke  Neither have I  Ever  And the punchline stinks  In the end  Yeah, we've just got to see the movie  I mean, it's not out yet  It's out  They've got great comics  They've got Carlin  The director will be in studio tomorrow 
[02:24:00]  Paul Provenza, right?  And this is also  Who we only remember from Full House  With Bob Saget  This is kind of his big return to comedy  Where he proved  And a half-baked  Right  Well, everyone says  He proved that he's funny again  Everyone says that  You know, he's one of the dirtiest comics  Out there, right?  You guys have told me  I think  Yeah, he's pretty dirty  Yeah, he's underrated out there  I guess so  Really dirty, so  Alright  Why did we go down that road?  Because you're talking about  The Aristocrats of the magazine  Well, we wanted to get  Sarah Silverman in the magazine  Because she's sort of like  You know, in a way  Kind of a perfect girl for us  And in some ways 
[02:24:30]  She's really funny and cute  And great  So this was like  The perfect moment  Are you guys doing features  On comedians?  Every week?  Well, you know  Sort of throughout  We don't have any features  Planned right now  I mean, there's  You know, only so many pages  We have a lot of  Beautiful women to do  We have a big-time comedian  In the studio today  Well, we'll have to talk  After the show  Yeah, A  Why don't you give  Norton credit?  You guys are mean  To each other  That's a good line  What do you guys think 
[02:25:00]  Of Misha Barton?  How's she looking here?  Very hot  Extremely hot  What show is she from?  She's the OC  Oh, okay  The OC  I don't watch the OC  Anthony was commenting  About the full metal  Jacket piece  You guys got  In your latest magazine  Yeah, this was great  I mean, this is  This is really, I think  One of the best things  We've ever done  It's  Very cool  The early sort of pages  Of this book  Came across  And who knew  20 years ago  That Matthew Modine  Took all these photographs  And we hadn't really  Heard much from Matthew Modine 
[02:25:30]  Since Vision Quest  I guess  In the 80s  So he  Sent over the book  We kind of  Just got totally  Freaked out by it  Love it  Love the movie  We've all seen it  50 times  And then we interviewed him  And he sort of  Talked over the whole thing  Kind of narrated  Where these pictures  Came from  And there's a lot  Of funny anecdotes  And stuff  Attached to them  I like the whole thing  About Gunny  How he wasn't cast  As the  No, he was a  He was a consultant  And so he would come in 
[02:26:00]  And I guess  The actor  Would go off to the side  Because he would get tired  Of screaming at the Marines  Screaming at the actors  Then Hartman would come in  And just start  And then they fired the actor  Yeah  They used  What's his name  Arlie Army  Yeah  Of course  He was just  Wow, that's amazing  He was just consulting  He was a consultant  Yeah  But did a better job  Than the actor  And said  Alright  That launched his career  And now  The last thing  Modine  Sort of  He said  I called him up  The other day  Because Army 
[02:26:30]  Has an action figure now  And he said  Modine says to him  Hey man  I saw your doll  And he screamed  Back into the phone  It's an action figure  God damn it  Yeah  He doesn't like it  Being called a doll  One of the best moments  On our show  We interviewed him  And we had him  Like redo the lines  But add our names  Into it  It was great  Him just  You know  Abusing us  It was a lot of fun  That day  We gotta get him  Back on  Yeah  What else is in  Giant Magazine  There Jamie  Well we got  We sort of have  A return  Of Piper Paraboo  If you remember her 
[02:27:00]  From Coyote Ugly  She was the  The lead girl  Dancing on the bar  Everybody remembers her  And then she sort of  Went away as well  And now she's back  With a movie called  The Cave  Which is coming out  This fall  She's just really  Hot  Cute  And a great interview  Too  She wanted to do  The indie thing  So Coyote Ugly  Kind of freaked her out  She got a little  Too famous  Wanted to do it  For the art  For the role  And so she was  In five or six  Indie movies  That no one saw  And now she's  Decided she wants  To be a Hollywood  Actor again 
[02:27:30]  And David Patrick Kelly  Interview with  David Patrick Kelly  In the back  You know who that is  I do  That was actually  When we were  When we were sketching  That guy  That did that thing  Right there  You passed it  Oh from  There he is  Come on  Warriors  Yeah from the Warriors  Right  Warriors 48 hours  Yep  Commando  I mean this is  Like this page  Every issue  We've done it  Since the beginning  Is kind of my favorite  Page in the magazine  Because it's like  The guy that we all 
[02:28:00]  Know but you just  Don't know  Oh my god  It's that guy  And he's like  In 80, 90 movies  Right  And so we just  Started interviewing  These guys  These are guys  That are never  Covered in magazines  Never invited  On your show  Never you know  Hey this guy  Would be invited  In a second  Yeah he would  As a huge star  He would be  An A-list celebrity  Yes  Have you ever  Interviewed Parker Posey  I didn't do  The interview with Parker  We did her  In the second issue  Actually we shot her  She's great  How come she doesn't  Go mainstream  You know  She's one of the interns  For a bat  That's a great question 
[02:28:30]  Why are you  A huge Parker Posey fan  Huh  She's a great actress  Why has she  Got mainstream  Why does she go mainstream  She's a great actress  Well we asked her that  They asked her  I said no  That's a god damn  Good question  Do you have a section  On your paper  For dumb questions  That's a fucking  Great question  What's wrong with you  Yeah it's great  Anthony's yawning  Anthony hasn't yawned  In three months  You guys don't like Parker  Parker's hot man  She's great  We like her  But we don't need to know  Why she hasn't gone mainstream 
[02:29:00]  What the fuck does that mean  And also  On the same thing  What do you feel  About Dustin Diamond  And his conservative  Political views  On fiscal responsibility  You should be executed  Mainstream  Mainstream  Will you explain yourself  Okay I'll  Because then you go  And say that's a great question  Because Parker Posey  One is a great actress  And great looking  But she only does  Small independent movies  How come she hasn't  Gone to Hollywood  And done mainstream films  That's a normal question 
[02:29:30]  You would ask  About an actress  She told us  She told us  Okay  What did she say  What was the answer  She can't get the job  Yeah  She auditions  She doesn't get hired  Perhaps Rich Voss  Should be on  Rich is a few actresses  Should be the producer  Trying to be in  Mainstream  Films in Hollywood  I mean we think  She's great  We think she belongs there  She does too  Jesus  Parker Posey  I can just see  The photoshops now  You and Parker Posey  You're going to be  All over that message board  Oh my god 
[02:30:00]  Then of course  You do the DVD reviews  And the movie reviews  Yeah we do a ton  We do a ton  A lot  A lot more than  Other magazines  It seems like  The DVD section  Goes on forever  And then a music review section  Yes  This is really funny  Me too  She's in that little  Independent film  That's coming out  Next year  Called Superman  You fucking idiot  She's in the new  Superman movie  She gets small roles  She gets small roles  In big movies  Action blockbuster 
[02:30:30]  I'm kind of bummed  The last issue  Of Giant Magazine  Had a great section  That I know  She didn't do  In this month's issue  Parker Posey  And what she's up to  Basically  It was people  That have died  Oh the obituary  The obituary section  But it's not  The big stars  That get all the  Headlines when they die  It's these little  Known actors  And actresses  That you kind of  Remember from these  Films  And you had no idea  They died  Like the chick  From Meet the Parents 
[02:31:00]  Right yeah  She had a heart attack  She was the  Sister  Terry Polo's sister  In the movie  She caught the  Mud in the face  Yeah  Well she was the one  That also got hit  With the volleyball  In the pool  Right  Exactly  And was bleeding  She took a lot of  I actually had a  Flu or something  Went to the  Hospital  Yep  And they sent her home  And it turned out  She had pneumonia  And yeah  She died  I don't know  It was a little bit  Of a downer  I don't know  We wanted to change  But it was really  Interesting  I mean there's got to  Be a way to rework that  Well we did rework it  It's called death 
[02:31:30]  It's on page 42  We wanted to make it  Maybe not so much  About people who really died  But things that maybe  Should die  Or have already died  In our minds  Like what?  Lollapalooza  Lollapalooza  Yeah  And they keep trying  To bring that thing back  Well now it's sort of  A one weekend thing  It was the first  Of the kind of  Big mega tours  Yeah  It was in Chicago  Last weekend  And you know  I think for two days  It was fine  But we should call it  Lollapathetic here  Lollapathetic  Okay  It was

[02:45:00]  And I'll get through it  I'm planning on  Doing the diving  And sometime this week  I'm getting back in the water  Possibly whenever  I get my stitches out  Yeah  Because  They have said  That I mean  You penetrate the water  Pretty deep  That's going to put  Some pressure on your nose  That's not going to feel  Real good  Yeah  That's mainly why  I did not compete  In the synchro event  On last Sunday  Because  This is our exclusive interview  With Chelsea Davis  Very painful  And it could have opened  Just go 
[02:45:30]  On my head  Yeah  Yeah  I see that  We see the stitches  Barbara  I'm sure your heart's  Going to be in your throat  When you see her  Get back up there  On the board  Nervous Barbara  Well actually  I know that her coach  Will put her in the water belts  Over the board  In the gym  And in the pool  And I know that  She will know where she is  By the time she does the dive again  She'll probably go out  Fairly far into the pool  For the first few times  She does it  But I know that  Yeah  I'm sure you're proud of her  Well 
[02:46:00]  Chelsea  I just  I can't wish you  Enough success in the future  That is  Really something  We're glad  You're here to talk about it  We hope those stitches  Close up quickly  And we wish you well  In the future  As you continue to compete  World's next year  Thank you  Yeah  World Cup  Hopefully  Chelsea  Barbara  We have  They've shown the clip  But we actually have audio  Yeah  Of her  Hey you guys  Oh my no  Sounded like it hurt 
[02:46:30]  Alright we got a bunch of things  We can do here  We got the aristocrat stuff  Yeah this movie's coming out  It's getting a huge buzz  We're going to have the director  On tomorrow  To talk about it  It's an old joke  That old comedians  Have told for many many years  And it's told differently  By each comedian  So they decided  To make a whole documentary  On the joke  And they decided  To get some of  Today's comedians  And some of the old timers  To do their representation  Of the joke I guess 
[02:47:00]  Three years  They were filming this  Really  So we got Penn Jillette  What is the aristocrats  All about  He explains this  And then we also have  Cartman  Cartman  Cartman  Cartman actually  Telling the aristocrat joke  Oh  In his  In his fashion  What is the aristocrat  It almost feels like  The Da Vinci Code  At some weird secret stage  Yeah it's just because  In the days of vaudeville  And the  And Jay Marshall  Who's in our movie  Who was in his  Eighties 
[02:47:30]  When he died recently  Heard it when he was  Eight  In vaudeville  By an old timer  So it was at least  A hundred years  And especially when  In vaudeville  You had to work so clean  The guys  Get together backstage  And tell a joke  The purpose of which  Was to be as dirty  Vile  And vulgar  In the middle as possible  If they wanted jokes at all  Why don't they just take one of mine  That was a good line  That was a good line  What do you guys think  Good or bad  What's the count up to 
[02:48:00]  Good lines to bad lines  Five and four  Five good  Four bad  That's right  But if you were  If I was a pro hitter  Yeah if you were  In Major League Baseball  That's pretty good  Or if you were  An accurate scorer  Yeah  Now if you said that  Why didn't you use  One of Voss's jokes  If you wanted something  That old  Right  It would have been funny  It would have been funny  If someone else said it  Yeah but  Isn't that odd  Yeah  That is really weird  That that works out like that  Here's Carmen 
[02:48:30]  Doing the Aristocrats joke  All right  His way  You guys want to hear  A funny joke  My grandpa told me  No  Okay  So this family  Walks into a talent agency  It's a mother  Father  Their son and daughter  And a little baby  The father says  To the talent agent  Sir our family  Has an amazing act  We know if you would  Let us perform it for you  You would want to sign us  And the talent agent says  Sorry we don't sign family acts  They're too cutesy  But then the mother goes  Please sir  If you just give us two minutes  We know you'll like our act  So the talent agent says  All right  You've got two minutes  The family jumps right into it  The mother smiles  And points to the son  Who hits play on a boombox 
[02:49:00]  Thrilling circus music  Starts to play  As the father  Spins his daughter around  Bins her over  Lifts up her skirt  And starts licking her asshole  What?  Then the son lays down  On the floor  And opens his mouth  And the mother  Tears off tear away pants  Squats down over his face  And starts shitting all over him  Dude  Hold on  Hold on  The father  Grabs the baby  Takes off his diaper  And starts sucking his cock  Right?  While the son  Still with his mother  Shit in his mouth  Goes over and licks  The baby's tiny little balls  Dude  Hold on  Now the mother lays down  On her back on the floor  While the daughter  Gets up high on a chair  And starts pissing all over  Then the father and son  Take the baby  And starts stuffing it  Head first  Back into the mother's vagina  While the daughter's piss 
[02:49:30]  Rains down on all of them  Dude  Just stop  They get the  Hold on  Hold on  They get the baby  Half way in  So that just his legs  Are sticking out  All kicking and flailing around  The son  Takes the mother's shit  Out of his mouth  And starts rubbing it  All over everyone  While the father  Sticks his cock  In the baby's asshole  And fucks it  While it's still inside  The mother  Until he comes all over  The baby  The wife  The son  And the daughter  Cartman  I don't want to  Cock  Will you hold on  Then the father  Gets up and says  And now for impersonation  Of the victims of 9-11  And the whole family  Starts running around  The room  Screaming and laughing  With their dicks and titties  All flapping around  Covered with shit  And piss and cum  Going 
[02:50:00]  And finally the family  Runs back to the  Sit of the room  And goes  And the tally agent  He just sits there  For the longest time  And finally he says  Jesus that's a hell of an act  What do you call it  And the father says  The aristocrats  I don't get it  Neither do I  That's exactly how I feel  About this whole aristocrats  Right  But we have the director 
[02:50:30]  Coming in tomorrow  To explain further  Because I don't get  The punchline  Can somebody explain  The punchline  Am I that stupid  Well they're not being  Very aristocratic  I understand  That's the only thing  I can really get at  But all that for  Right  I gotta look up  The word aristocrat  It was a different time  A hundred years ago  More things at the  Political party  Set ups  I can get set ups  He was a stand up comic  For years  Paul Provenza  Yeah he was a good comic 
[02:51:00]  Yeah he was  He  But that's what  The movie's going to be about  A bunch of comedians  You know  Doing their version  Of that joke basically  They got great comics man  So wow  That is pretty  Pretty harsh  Yeah  And where was that  Obviously not on TV  Was that on the DVD  Or something  Or the movie  Was that part of the movie  I don't think so  It was  Oh they just put it online  Yeah  Very good  Alright  I remember seeing  Something like that  On an episode though  But they had bleeped  A lot of stuff  Could I be right  Or am I wrong

[02:55:30]  One way  Others another way  But it'll work both ways  Holy crap  How can you be politically correct  Slow news day  Yeah  He wouldn't even give the answer  The way he likes it  No  Holy crap  Well this definitely has  People not buying  Is toilet tissue  We might even name this bit  After you Travis  Call it something like  Travis  Watches TV  Or  This awful television  Well for the first one 
[02:56:00]  Not bad  That's one of the dumb things  They're doing on TV this morning  Really  Asinine  They have Penny Corona  At the toilet paper factory  Very good  It's funny  When they tested it  They showed Norton in the room  And they're wiping his stomach off  That's not bad  I was thinking of you  Said face  Yeah  You should have just committed to it  I like that one  Why don't you give yourself  A good line  There you go  What are we up to now  Six four  Guys  Word is  Believe it or not  The most outrageous  Filthiest  Most disgusting version 
[02:56:30]  Of the aristocrat's joke  In the film  Is Bob Saget's version  With Gilbert Gottfried  Coming in a close second  That's why I thought  It was odd  That it's the same joke  How could you tell  How could you have that many comics  Telling the same joke  And keep it interesting  So I guess it's their little versions of it  Because it's not really  You know  What  I know people have said that  Oh okay  No no  I know people have said that  I obviously know  I got scared  Well yeah  The set up is the same  And then it's how you tell it after that  That's all  Just looking at the 
[02:57:00]  I'm sorry  Just looking at the list of comedians  I realize how off the comedy radar I am  Oh Jimmy  Don't make  Don't feel bad about yourself  Because of this list  I mean Vos too  You're also finished  No well here's the thing  Why you should have been on this  You think  But you never heard the joke  But they didn't know that  Well Provenzo was in  I heard he was in New York  Richard  And he saw  Regal and Lisa  Cellar  And you know  It's all basically out of L.A.  And older guys  You know  How's he going to know you  He doesn't go  Are these a lot of L.A. guys 
[02:57:30]  Yeah there's some L.A. guys  On there  You know  Yeah David Tell's not in there  Quinn  Yeah  Colin's not on  I mean  Apollo  Does Colin know that Joe  Patrice  Colin will deny it  But I'm sure he does  Colin made it up  Yeah  He's fucking old  Alright  You wouldn't understand  A word he said  He tried to clean it up  To be clever  Alright moving on  This is something  Anthony brought to our attention  I did  The sounds from Saturn 
[02:58:00]  What's this about  Oh I just thought  It was interesting  I never heard this before  But apparently  They got radio sounds  From Saturn  From the planet Saturn  I thought you said  You had sounds  From us Saturn  I was really nervous  You don't get your money  Back daddy  Oh  Chuck went up for Jimmy  God damn  That's funny  See the difference  Jimmy doesn't have 
[02:58:30]  To keep track  That's right  Because he's not always  Over the barrel here  What's wrong with that  Over the barrel  You know what  You guys  Cassini  The Cassini satellite  Reveals Saturn's  Eerie sounding radio emissions  Saturn's radio emissions  Could be mistaken  For a Halloween soundtrack  Opie  That's how two researchers  Describe their recent findings  Okay  There's a satellite up there  Cassini  Was sent out  And apparently  It's picking up  These radio signals 
[02:59:00]  From Saturn  And they're making  These sounds  So I was just curious  To hear them  I haven't heard them yet  But they're supposed  To be kind of creepy  Alright you want to listen  To the sounds of Saturn  I guess  No the sounds  Of Saturn  Hey  That battle  Is on there  What he's saying  That battle  Is near  No  Very active on Saturn 
[02:59:30]  Chilling  Apparently they're watching  Blazing Saddles  And listening to this show  On Saturn  Scary  They're there too  I should have known  That makes me angry  And when Dr. Evil  Gets angry  Pat Battle  Gets upset  And when  Pat Battle  Gets upset  People  Die  Nice  Nice Dr. Evil  Impression  Do me a fucking favor 
[03:00:00]  Cause you're driving me crazy  You're a killer  You're a big shot  Just kill  You're a killer  You fucked that battle  What  You fucked that battle  How could you ask me a question  Oh it continues  It continues  Do you know who I am  I'm Pat Battle  I made my bones  When you were going out  With cheerleaders  That is the worst  Moe Green impression ever  Pat Battle  Pat Battle  What the hell is this 
[03:00:30]  That's a sudden message  That means  Pat Battle  He sleeps with the fishes  They are so bad  At dubbing these things in  As far back as I can remember  I always wanted to be  Pat Battle  The one from Blazing Saddles  Is probably the best one  To date  Oh yeah  Absolutely  Going to be hard to top that one  That is very funny  Let's say hi to Duke  From New Jersey  Duke what's up  So Travis' new show 
[03:01:00]  Should be  Travis T.V  Travis T.V  Yes  Like Travis T  V  Travis T.V  Travis T.V  Travis  I got it  Travis T.V  Travis T.V  Travis T.V  Right  Kind of like a word play  Right  Rich Moss  I have a 1967  Chevy Impala  I'll let you drive it  For 500 bucks  For an hour  I'm in Cliffside Park  Right across the bridge  I'm going to give myself  A bad line for that  Which turns out 
[03:01:30]  To be a good line  So why don't you  Give yourself a good line  There you go  That's right Rich  You took lemons  You made lemonade  Good boy  Alright Anthony  Here is the real sounds  Of  That they're picking up  On the satellite  That's around Saturn  Get the fuck out of it  That's creepy  That's like old 
[03:02:00]  Star Trek sound effect  Then the flying saucers  Will fly over  That was Ed Wood's  Sound effect  What this proves is 
[03:02:30]  Saturn  Is emitting  More entertaining radio  Than Jim Phillips  Help me  Help me  Isn't that creepy  That is really creepy  Actually  The sounds of Saturn 
[03:03:00]  Well explain that again  This is what the  Satellite's picking up  Yeah the radio  Transmissions that the  Satellite's picking up  Because these big planets  Emit radio signals  Just from the planet  Just throws radio out  Into space  And it picks it up  And that's what it  Boils down to  When they process it  And play it  Oh Saturn stole that  From me  That was mine  Tell him Fred  I was making creepy  Noises for years  Damn it I had it all 
[03:03:30]  Tell him Fred  Oh well  Now it doesn't make sense  It's Ben  Tell him Fred  Alright here  We got more audio  This is a short clip  Come on  That's pretty eerie  These are just radio waves  That are flying around  Off the planet  Like equipment malfunction  Or something  Yeah right  Something like that 
[03:04:00]  Yeah  And they're not explaining  This further yet  No that's pretty much it  It's just radio waves  From Saturn  You're hearing them  There they are  Some form of  Intelligent life  I don't know  I don't think so  If you listen close  You're going to hear  Cathedral  Cathedral  We got more  Oh  See that sounds  A little different  That's very creepy 
[03:04:30]  Alright  So that's an ongoing story  That's your science  That's your science lesson  For the day  From popular science  People want that audio  Where the fuck  Can I get that audio  That's creepy as hell  Any Nine Inch Nails album 
[03:05:00]  Yeah  Wow  Alright let's go to  Greg in California  Just go to  Fark.com  That's where we found it  We should give  Fark a good plug  Yeah that came off  Of Fark  Those two jokes  Let's acknowledge this  My last two jokes  Bombed so bad  No one made eye contact  With it  That bad  It was almost like  You had all walked in  On me  You ever see  Prince of Tides  When Nick Nolte's a boy  Being fucked in the ass  And his brother  Looks in the window  And sees it  And then shoots  The perpetrators  That's how the feeling  I just got  Like you all just  Peek through the curtain 
[03:05:30]  And saw me being raped  By an older gentleman  That bad  I was listening too  I wasn't  I didn't even hear it  You know what band  I'll hear it on the replay  Do you know what band  He referenced  Nine Inch Nails  Oh you were listening  I heard that part  Oh okay  You were listening  Yeah  I didn't think it was that bad  I didn't feel like  It was worth the energy  To chuckle over  But  It actually removed energy  Let's say hi to Greg  In California  Greg  Yeah 
[03:06:00]  I'm thinking that audio  From Saturn  Sounds exactly like  The Leslie Nielsen movie  Forbidden Planet  Oh yeah  Sounds like some of those  Old sci-fi movies  No I mean  We're talking  You play them side by side  And I'm pretty sure  It's exact  And by the way  Voss has nothing to the show  Punching out  Thank you  Why don't you like Voss  That's going to make Voss  Freak out all night long  No it doesn't  Not anymore  I have a lot more confidence  In life now  Hey Anthony  Gamefly.com is the world's  Leading online video game

[03:08:00]  Alright let's go to the phones  And talk to Dr. Gonzo  From Whackbag.com  Hey guys  I have an announcement  Sirius Radio  Just signed Saturn  To a $100 million deal  Tell them Fred  That's very funny  They sign anybody  You see  Alright let's say  Hi to Greg in Baltimore  Greg what's up  Hey hey  Hey Greg  I was calling to say  You guys need to give  Rich Voss a break today  I mean if he had his own  Radio show in Orlando  His three listeners  Would kick the  Phillips file  Two listeners asses 
[03:08:30]  Every single day  Really  I think they would  Georgia  It's Georgia  What Greg  I said I think  Rich  I think of Rich  His own radio show  His listeners  Would probably  They might have  A cumulative IQ  Of about 100  So don't worry about it  Georgia  He's a good guy  It's Georgia  You had this written down  No no  Actually I was reading it  Off your website Rich  Howtobeunfunny.com  You don't like Voss dude 
[03:09:00]  Excuse me  Voss is hilarious  You don't like Voss  Do you like Voss or hate Voss  You're just being silly  No I like Voss  Just not today  No I like Voss  He's doing great today  He's funny  Yeah Voss  How many good lines Voss  Like six  Six or seven  I'm just hanging out  You throw in something  These guys  This is their show  And you know  Every now and then  You throw something in  I'm not coming in here  To audition  You know  Something comes out  It comes out  He doesn't need to  You know what I'm saying  Alright  We're going to take a break  You know what I'm saying  We've got a couple more stories  To get to before we get out of here 
[03:09:30]  They found a very very very old vibrator  I guess it wouldn't be a vibrator  Because they didn't have batteries back then  They had it  They found a marital aid  How's that  The oldest marital aid  I just had that up on the web  Wow  Yeah  Are you kidding  Well ancient phallus  Yeah we'll do that after the break  Also  Yes Jimmy  I'm thinking of marital aid  Is it an ancient rowboat  It would have been funnier  If I said motorboat  Because then the sound clip 
[03:10:00]  Would have made sense  It's not  Splash  Splash  Splash  Splash  We've got a story about a cool mom  That's really good  And  There he goes  Back to Minnesota  To finish off the hat trick  Of wacky stories  We have a little story  About how doctors  Are planning  To do face  Transplants  That's right kids  Face  Transplants  After the break  Like sand  Through the hourglass  So is the 
[03:10:30]  O&A virus  Now I was never able to  I'm talking about  A mattress  Where did I get my bedding from  I had absolutely no money  Ew  That's right  I actually got my grandma's bed  Which is kind of sick  When you think her and grandpa  Were fucking on it for a while  Steve ripped his headphones off  Screw  Wait Steve  I can't hear that  No screw that  You know the grandparents  Effing  That's whatever  But what about later in life  When they were just losing  Their bowels in the middle of the night 
[03:11:00]  No she wasn't doing that  Yeah how do you know  Grandma wasn't crapping the bed  How do you know  You see Steve  I know  How do you know  I know  Grandma wasn't like that  Not when I got that bed  That's for sure  Yeah  She wasn't all that old  Which leads me to believe  There might have been some  You know  Grandma grandpa action  Going on on the bed  I should have checked it  With a black light  I'm thinking maybe  A little butt sex  No stop it  Or a little crime scene sex  No  No  You know it was just  The basic missionary position  To show their appreciation 
[03:11:30]  For each other  Are you insane  That's all it was  There was nothing kinky going on  Grandpa would get back  From the trotters  At the track  He'd come up  And you know  Maybe he hit a horse  Hey kids  You feel good  And feel like  Now he's got to hit grandma  Hey kids  You think you're a young stud  You know all those  Crazy positions you try in bed  Your grandparents  Did the exact same thing  No  Of course they did  It's pure missionary  Of course they did  That's it  Just to show that  They appreciate each other's company  For so many years  And then they're done 
[03:12:00]  Actually never even  Left any stains on the bed  Your grandma did  Backward cowgirl  No  Yes she did  Never ever  Ever  When they're a backward cowgirl  Involved  She was probably doing it  Well into her 60s  You're a mad person  That is not  That never happened  Have you ever seen  Old stag films  Sure  I mean I'm not  I'm not suggesting anything  Personal  I'm just saying  Old stag films  If now they're transferring  Them to DVD  You can see that all of these 
[03:12:30]  Twisted sexual positions  Existed back in the 20s  Right when the  Kinetoscope was  Yeah we think  We're coming up with new ones  Stop  It was just for making kids  And then maybe the kinkiest stuff  Was left for the guma  That was  That was a hard job  I came to a realization  That older people  Grandparents  Were still very very horny  When I was driving  On I-95  With my grandma  85 years old  Yeah  And we're on I-95  And there's a car 
[03:13:00]  In the grandma lane  Basically right  Going really really slow  And I noticed  Oh my god  This guy's getting road head  Holy ass  Which is so freaking cool  When you say shit like that  On the highway  When you're traveling  Right  And so I think  Either my sister  Or I had a couple brothers  There were more people  In the car  And we're all like  Jesus look at this  You know  And of course  You gotta check it out  So we're slowing down  And checking it out  And stuff  And I looked at my grandma  She had the biggest  Freaking smile on her face 
[03:13:30]  She was enjoying the hell  Really?  Oh yeah  Because I guarantee  Her mind was in overdrive  Thinking about all the crazy stuff  She did in her life  You think one time  Guaranteed  The old model T was going  Yeah  Horse and buggy  Why don't you come over here  Light up a lucky  Head in the lab  In the model T  And that's when I looked  At my grandma  And thought  Man  If the circumstances  Were right  My grandma  Would want some action still  And she was 85 at the time 
[03:14:00]  I mean the smile  The enjoyment  Really?  She got  She got such enjoyment  Knowing that was going on  Right next to us  On the highway  Opie and Anthony  The virus is spreading  Is someone getting the best  The best  The best  The best  The best  Of you  Is someone getting  The best  The best  The best  The best  Of you  Has someone  Taking your faith  It's real 
[03:14:30]  The pain you feel  You trust  You must  You're fast  Is someone getting  The best  The best  The best  The best  Of you  Oh god  Jim Norton  Is trying on shorts  Because he's going to  Ozfest after the program  He'll have exclusive interviews  On the Opie and Anthony show  Tomorrow  And he's videotaping  Jimmy changing his pants  He's got his boxes  Oh my god 
[03:15:00]  What are you doing over there  Jimmy  Trying on shorts  Yeah I don't own  Thank you to Mike  For going for me  I don't own shorts  With a belt loop  I didn't realize that  So I'm just  I asked him to go get me  Shorts with a belt loop  Go get shorts  Those don't fit me  Those are 32  Will they fit you?  Yeah  If you don't want those  I'll take them  Why wouldn't I want them?  I asked him to go buy them  Why would I not  Because they might not fit you  What's your waist now?  I don't know  I'm going to try  I got 34s  They'll be probably too big  And 32s  32s  I'm going to say  You're 33  Let me see 
[03:15:30]  32  You're going to be  Right in between  That's a 32  Oh they're going to fit  Holy crap  Look at you  Is it too tight?  Walk around a little  Make sure  You're selling  Boy Scout cookies  Talk about boy shorts  You're like a little kid  You've got the same  Shorts as Steve on  Yeah you do  They're pretty much  The same shorts  You can't give me shit  For having little boy shorts  But I still can give you shit  For talking like this  These are very comfy  Ten minutes and counting 
[03:16:00]  Anthony  Are we going to have a launch  Or what?  The clock is still running  Yes  Are these too sluggies?  John Glenn became  First American to orbit Earth  Let's do the countdown from now  Nine minutes  Forty-five  Forty-four  You think that's a  Great radio?  Or we'll just have  Boss tell a joke  I had to pawn it off on you  Because I was bombing  It's okay  Let's go to Pat from New Jersey  You've got to admit  Yeah  Hey guys  What's up?  Huh?  The aristocrat started out as a prank 
[03:16:30]  Old comics would tell it to young comics  It doesn't make any sense  But it would be like  If you were in a room with Richard Pryor  And George Carlin  And they told you the joke  And you were a young comic  You would kind of feel obligated to laugh  Oh right  It's kind of a set up to joke  On the younger comics with  All right  Now because I do remember hearing that also  What?  That I didn't know that  That was this joke  The aristocrat's joke  It's kind of a goof on young comics  It's sort of like  Now that everyone just tries to outdirt each other 
[03:17:00]  Like it kind of lost that into it  But yeah  That was the original version  You'd tell it  And then people would laugh  And they'd be ridiculous for laughing  Because it's not funny  Yes  All right  Well I'm very interested in this documentary  It's coming out soon  And we'll have the director on tomorrow  So  Jimmy's sitting around now  In his underwear  He's just sitting around now  He's doing the show in his underwear  With his feet kicked up on the console  So what?  Eight minutes thirty seconds before launch  You want to get into the  Couple of these dumb stories? 
[03:17:30]  Jesus Jimmy  Why not?  Like pants and shorts  Cave gals exposed as sex toy users Anthony  Yeah  A sculpted polished phallus  They may have not had the pink pussy cat boutique back then  But  But prehistoric women did have sex toys  Researchers say  A sculpted and polished phallus  Recently found in a German cave  Has been identified as one of the earliest representations  Of a marital aid 
[03:18:00]  Wow  The 7.8 inch long  1.2 inch wide stone object  Said to be 28,000 years old  Was buried in the cave near  How many years?  28,000 years  How many zeros were on that?  Free  Oh my god  Three zeros  It's life size suggests  It was used by women  To achieve sexual satisfaction  Anthony  Yeah  It's highly polished  It certainly is 
[03:18:30]  Meaning it was probably used a lot  It's clearly recognizable  Professor Nicholas Blablabla said  He told the BBC this  The phallus will be displayed  The Professor Nicholas Blablabla  The  Very good  Yeah  The phallus will be displayed  At an exhibition  Called  Ice Art  Clearly Male  At the Museum of the Prehistoric  And Blablabla  Blablabla  Blablabla  They don't say it's black  That's why it hasn't worked for 28,000 years  The display they show that I should be called 
[03:19:00]  Whores  They always have been  That was funny  Are you high today?  That was funny  You're just cracking yourself up, man  I think Voss is having a nervous breakdown  Right in front of us  Slowly but surely  Well Poopsie's not here  Yeah, good old Poopsie  She's going to be on Letterman on Friday, right?  Yeah  All right, Bonnie's going to be on Letterman Friday  Make sure you check that out  Actually, we'll play her appearance on our show 
[03:19:30]  What do you mean?  Oh, Monday  Yeah, we'll do a Monday  Give her, you know, an extra plug there  Extra push  Oh, yeah  Six minutes and 15 seconds, Anthony  Yeah, I'm watching  First one in like two years, I guess  So anything on this sex toy we need to discuss?  No, just I've never heard of them finding anything like that  Some have been truly exquisite  Sophistication, such as a 30,000 year old figurine crafted from ivory  Mammoth ivory  That would be nice 
[03:20:00]  And then they got another little statuette of a woman figure from 30,000 years old  From 30,000 years ago  And she's nude and just atrocious  It's a big fat thing  Wow  With huge saggy tits  And they actually show pussy lips  They carved out a little pussy lips  And it looks like she had a Hitler mustache going  I don't see any hair  Oh, wow, look at that  Look, see, see the little  Meow  Yeah, that's hot  Meow  Wow  That was before crunches were invented 
[03:20:30]  See, there was sex and stuff  That's like, that was their porno  They would look at a statuette like that and probably jerk off  There were probably organizations trying to ban the carving of ivory into female forms  And our civilization will be the one that stops it all, right?  Yep  Let's just calm the fuck down  It's going to go on way past  People have been enjoying it for quite some time  And they will continue  Brian from D.C. is saying  Rich's last joke was good  I hate to admit it 
[03:21:00]  Did you mark it down?  Yeah, of course I did  That was one of my thoughts in the day  I love this new bit  Because then you have proof that you were good  And we're giving you the proof  And we're being very honest  Yeah, I don't think bombs  We're being fair  Let's say hi to Steve the trucker  Steve  Yo  Hey, Steve  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey  Doing good, Steve  Yeah, I just wanted to know  I just wanted to know where that  Took 28,000 years to get the smell off that  Wow  Wow  Do you have a list of good and bad next to you? 
[03:21:30]  You should chalk off something in the bad column  And if you don't have a pen  Just use the left side of your rig  And slam into a guardrail  Okay, I'll do that  Later  Later  There you go, Steve the trucker  Okay  Why don't you guys report that I didn't screw up  During the Hannity interview  That, you know, you went over the tapes  And I didn't  That was  What, we went over the tapes?  He didn't say Haggerty?  He did say Haggerty  He did?  Yeah, he said Haggerty  What?  You goddamn  He said Haggerty  We listened? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, we listened  We all listened  You were there, Rich  We all, like, kind of  Cried around the tape recorder  And we played it back  Sean Haggerty  We just didn't want to embarrass you  We wanted to let you slide on that one  Yeah  You know  You'll hear it during the replay  Last time I was here  We were talking about the first time we got laid  And Bonnie was here  And I wanted to tell the story so bad  But I couldn't  Let me tell you real quick  I was at Seaside  We checked in  We went down to the shore for the weekend  It was like a big holiday weekend  So me and my friend Brian rented a room 
[03:22:30]  Right?  And the lady at the place  It was called, like, I don't know  Kathleen Sweets or something  She goes, I might rent the other half of the room  To other people  Because it was, you know  Oh, sorry  That's just so cool  So I said to her  So I said  They're firing up the engines  Engines are moving  I'll tell the story next time  You better tell the story  Keep telling  Because it better be shorter than three minutes  We got three minutes  They're just  Oh, okay  They just turned the key  They turned the key on  They turned the key on  It's just  It's foaming up a little bit  The engines are being put in their 
[03:23:00]  Through their little things that they do  Their cycles they do  Before they light them up  Anthony, before we go to the launch  And then your story, Rich  We're not going to forget about Duke  We've got to say hi to Donahue  Go ahead, Donahue  Yo, guys  Howard just said that  He's the one that actually invented the dough  They stole it from him  Tell him, Fred  Tell him, Fred  Hoo-hoo  I had a tell him, Fred  Hoo-hoo sighting yesterday  You did?  And he gave me the evil eye  Fred?  And then jumped right on his cell phone immediately  Fred or Howie?  Fred  Fred? 
[03:23:30]  Tell him, Fred  He gave me the evil eye  At the grocery store  Did he tell you?  About the bandanas?  No, he didn't say anything  Oh, here it comes  A little cap is coming off the top of the fuel tank  All right  This is our exclusive coverage of the space shuttle launch  Just about two minutes left  What are they saying?  Of course, the delay is awful on our show  And as you are hearing this  It's less than two minutes that are left  It's a short delay  It's a short delay  It's already orbited  Actually, it's landing right now  This is actually the endeavor 
[03:24:00]  Right  We're down to a minute and 50 seconds  They're swinging away part of the tower  Can we pot up the audio?  This is...  Oh, yeah  Why don't we just do that?  Jesus Christ  Yeah  It's their visors now  They're strapped in  Don't they send these up like every month these things?  It's me  Holy crap  It's been off for over two years  Well, whatever  So are you guys  But...  No, this is the first time in two years  Oh  This is a really big deal 
[03:24:30]  It's America's return to space  And then we go back to having them launch this every other month  And we don't care  No one cares  Okay  What I find amazing is they didn't even change the damn design on this in the last two years  No, they've implemented a lot of safety magic  But NASA, what they have said is, hey, nothing is 100%, they said  That's their little confidence booster they give out  Hey, life isn't 100%  All right, we're talking a minute before the launch of the space shuttle 
[03:25:00]  T-minus one minute  President Laura Bush  Laura Bush  That's Laura and the brother  Jeb  And Jeb  Because it is Florida  And, you know, he's going to be turned off  All right, what are we down to?  We're down to 47 seconds  45 seconds  How far away is that thing?  Fucking eight miles?  That thing is real far from the spectator  The viewing area, I think, was  We had that guy, the news guy on  He said, what, five miles or something like that?  Yeah, it's really far  They don't want you close  Florida is so flat and awful  Isn't it?  Yeah, they're actually sitting in Georgia watching this 
[03:25:30]  All right, here we go, guys  Here we go  Oh, boy  This better go  First time in two years  This will be such a downer  If this thing doesn't get off the ground  Downer if it actually makes it out of space  Firing chain is armed  Funny  Sounds of pressure  Water system is being activated  We've got my shorts  They light it with sparklers  Holy  Three engines up and burning  Three  Two  One 
[03:26:00]  And liftoff of space shuttle Discovery  Beginning America's new journey  It's like it's going all slow  It's like it's going all slow  Oh, Jesus  And the vehicle has cleared the tower  That's a whippoorwill  They don't have those there  How far do you think you can see that on the plane?  What?  How far away do you think you can see that on the plane?  Two or three miles easy  I was down  Oh, man, look at that camera shot they got now  Look at how fast you are ascending  Underneath the, uh, it's right on the fuel tank 
[03:26:30]  Underneath the shuttle  Altitude 12,000 feet  Already  It's nerve-wracking  This is so nerve-wracking  You've got that weird feeling right now  I don't want to see anything bad  They're going upside down right now  That's what they do  We're going backwards  Backwards  And it looks like, uh 
[03:27:00]  Nine minutes since launch  Discovery speed now 900 miles per hour  900 miles per hour  Go for throttle up  Go for throttle up  You don't want to hear that one again  All systems remain go for discovery  Altitude now 9 miles  Remain go?  What else are they going to do?  Altitude 9 miles  A minute  When do they jettison that thing in?  Do you know?  The engines?  The, uh, big fuel thing  Oh, the big fuel thing doesn't go for a little while  They still a little longer? 
[03:27:30]  They aced the engines first  One and a half minutes since launch  Discovery has already consumed  More than two and a quarter million pounds  Of propellant  It weighs less than half  Of what it did at lift-off  What?  It's now 2,000 miles per hour  It's now speeded  18 miles  14 miles northeast  Of the Kennedy Space Center  Imagine stopping in  The fuel that thing up  Now, that thing  You think  Patches and will just take off  Nobody answer them  You think the astronauts  Are feeling a lot of pressure right now?  Here go the, uh  Standing by now  For burnout and jettison  Of the twin solid rockets 
[03:28:00]  And here we go  Uh-oh  Okay  There we go  That's pretty cool  And  Booster officer confirms  Clean separation  Of the solid rocket boosters  Discovery now  Three main engines  Second stage  Speed now  3,030 miles per hour  3,030 miles an hour  40 miles  Downrange from the Kennedy Space Center  3,000 miles an hour  After two minutes  Or three minutes  Discovery's  Overmaneuvering system  Engines are now firing  To assist its climb to orbit 
[03:28:30]  They'll fire for about  Two minutes and 19 seconds  Wow  That's something  Looks like, uh  Looks like we've got a good one  Already  But you can see black  Yeah, they're  Just about in space  Please  This again  A view from  Camera on the  External fuel tank  For Discovery  Discovery Houston  Two engine  Zaragoza  What?  Uh-oh  Discovery is  Two engine  Zaragoza  That call that Discovery  Could perform a transatlantic  Landing at a  Spanish Air Force base  In Zaragoza, Spain  If required  Three engines 
[03:29:00]  Can you operate well  All systems  In good condition  Altitude now  254,000 feet  Or about 48 miles  Discovery speed  4,500 miles per hour  85 miles northeast  Of the Kennedy Space Center  That thing can move, huh?  It goes to 17,000 miles an hour  Yeah  Can you imagine the feeling?  Wow  That's about all you can say  I think this nation's heart  Was in its throat  Yeah 
[03:29:30]  You guys said it all right there  I felt that  Yeah  Especially when it's separated  There's like a little flare  Yeah, you just don't want to see  Anything blowing up like that  Gotta stop breathing for a second  Alright, there you go  Pretty rough  It made it  Good  Oof, we go  That camera angle  Is something brand new  Yeah  And when they jettison the fuel tank  That kind of  I bet that's gonna be  A pretty cool shot  Some guy in Tennessee  Is claiming he saw the lift off  Dave in Tennessee  What's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Alright  I'm about 110 miles away 
[03:30:00]  Down in Florida  And that thing looked like  It was 50 feet away  Oh, really?  Really?  Oh, my God  It was just a ball of flame  In the sky  Yeah, I saw one  From about 90 miles out  It was wild  And it just lit up  The whole sky  Alright, Dave  Thank you  I can see you from here  Hey, no problem  Alright  Reggie from Tennessee  Reggie  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Reggie?  Hey, Reggie  Oh, man, a couple years ago  When they had the night launch  I think I was, what?  Probably about 40, 50 miles 
[03:30:30]  South of Savannah, Georgia  And I saw a lift off  So you can see it  From pretty far away, man  That's pretty amazing  Yeah  You saw it all the way down  In Georgia  Or all the way up  I guess it would be  All the way up  Probably about halfway through  The state on Interstate 95  Wow  Alright  Thank you, Reggie  Yep, have a good one, guys  Okay, Mike in Florida  Go ahead, Mike  Mikey  Yes, sir  Hey, I'm in Florida right now  I'm on the other coast  I can see you from here  Everybody was pulled over  On the side of the road  Wow 
[03:31:00]  That's what's so cool  About doing a national talk show  You can get this reaction right away  Yeah, when I was calling you guys  That wasn't even what I was calling for  I heard on Fox News a few days ago  They're retiring that shuttle in 2010  I don't know if they have a new one ready  Or if they're just not going to use  That one anymore after that time  But that's what they said  Well, hopefully they have a new design  It's just  It'd be nice to look at something  Different at this point  I was sitting here waiting on hold  I looked over  I see all these people pull over  I thought it was an accident  And I looked over  And you could see it  I didn't think we'd be able to see it  From where I am  But you could definitely see it 
[03:31:30]  That's pretty cool  Alright, Mike  Thank you  Sean from Old Bridge, New Jersey  Is this true?  One of the astronauts just said  I can still see Ben's hog from here  Wow  Wow  They're coming in like crazy  Eyewitnesses  Frank from Florida  Go ahead, Frank  Hey, guys  How you doing?  Hey, I'm about 10 miles away  You can hear the crackle  Of the solid rocket boosters  As it went up  That is nuts  Can you imagine?  10 miles  Yeah  Yeah 
[03:32:00]  Lived out here all my life  Got  My father retired from the Space Center  40 years  Wow  Very good  Alright  This just in from Eric Logan  He text messaged me  Oh, yeah  What did he say?  The full shuttle coverage  Is alive and well  On XM200  Ha  Thank you, Elo  Thank you  Give it to Elo  Let's say hi to Joe  In  Yo, what's up?  Titusville  About five miles away from it  It's cool as shit, man  The sonic boom  Wanted to hit you  It's pretty cool 
[03:32:30]  Can you still see it?  Little Jimmy  What's up, bro?  Can you still see it or no?  No, it went away like pretty quick  It was only up there for about  You know, 30 seconds or so  But then that smoke or whatever  Just stays in the sky for a long time  Yeah  Oh, it's amazing  Yeah, that smoke's still there, too  I was in Winter Park  When one of these things lifted off  And you see it across the sky  Like for at least another hour or so  It just kind of sits there  Yeah, that's where I just came from  Winter Park, man  And just drove out to Titusville  It was crazy  Right on  It was good to see  Alright, Joe 
[03:33:00]  Thank you  Bye, bye, bye, bye, boys  Bye, bye, bye, boys  Alright, doctors planning face transplants, Anthony  Stop  At least two hospitals are reportedly in the final phases  Of planning a controversial new procedure  Face transplant  Doctors are close  Check this out  To perfecting a way to remove the face from a cadaver  And stitch it on to an adult  Even if I was in a fire, I wouldn't want this  I would not want this  Creepy  How great would that be? 
[03:33:30]  If it was a hot fake, good-looking guy  Yeah, I'd love to have my face replaced  The surgery not meant as a replacement for Botox  Would only be for someone whose face is severely damaged  In, say, an accident or fire  Currently, doctors rebuild a face by  Cobbling?  Cobbling together tissue from sites all over the body  The new method would permit them to mold both the face  And its underlying tissue  That is creepy  Alright  And you can go into prison  And get info from a guy's brother 
[03:34:00]  As his brother  Which is, uh  Yeah, it'll help crime fighting  In the future  Right now they're saying that it's only for burn victims  Because they haven't perfected it yet  So anything they do  Burn victims are going to be happy with  You know, hey, that was good  You know, they just take it  And kind of nail it to his head  Here, goodbye, take care  But once they perfect it  Then they'll start using it cosmetically  Right  I mean, I'm joking  You know, I'm being the silly goose that I'm paid to be  Silly goose you are  But the reality is  That's why they're not using it cosmetically  It's not ready  Whoa, what's coming off of it? 
[03:34:30]  Is that bad?  No  They've still got the fuel tank camera going  It's about to separate from the fuel tank  The picture going a little snowy  Here comes the jettison  Oh, cool  Perfect  Why haven't they always had that camera?  Discovery jettisoned external fuel tank  That is a wild view 
[03:35:00]  Discovery's main engines  Discovery performing a maneuver to fire its jets  And ensure clean separation from the tank  Now we lose the camera angle  Yeah  Once they put the camera on the thing  They mounted it wrong  That is not required  That's what every astronaut would love to watch  Dude, we can't make a cell phone  That takes more than two megapixel fucking photos  And yet they can mount that and put it into space  Yeah  They're wasting all that technology on space  You're so right, Jimmy  Well, you know what I mean 
[03:35:30]  That's a good point  Screw that  They're still communicating with them  And we can't make a phone call a mile away from the studio  Breaking up  Oh, this guy in Wyoming  Very bummed out  Let's get Joe on the line  Joe  Yeah  What's up, Joe?  You're on the line, Joe  Go  Hey, I was in Wyoming  And I couldn't see shit  Oh, yes, you can  Just look around the state you're in  All right  I'm punching out  All right  Cool mom had teen sex  Golden, Colorado 
[03:36:00]  A woman who had just wanted to be a cool mom  Pleaded guilty yesterday to sexual assault  After having sex with high school boys at parties  Where she supplied drugs and alcohol  She is a wreck  She's the definition of the cool mom  See her?  Yeah, look at her  I'd still fuck her, though  She's cool  Jeez  Sylvia Johnson, 40  Pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of sexual assault  And nine felony counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor  As part of a plea agreement 
[03:36:30]  Prosecutors dropped two counts of distribution of, ooh, meth, nice  She described herself as a cool mom  Said the detective  He added that Johnson had told investigators that she was very popular in high school  And now began feeling like one of the group  Prosecutors did not recommend a sentence  But each sexual assault count carries up to four years in prison  And each count contributing to the delinquency of a minor carries up to nine years  Johnson was free on bail  Held the parties almost weekly, Anthony 
[03:37:00]  Wow  These drug and booze parties where she was having sex with the kids  Who ratted?  God, yeah  Who rats out the cool mom?  She did it from October 2003 to October 2004  So she was getting away with this for a good year  She was accused of providing drugs and alcohol to eight boys  And of having sex with five of them  The police probe, here's your answer, Anthony  Began when one boy told his own mother  About the encounters and she told the authorities  A little killjoy  Gee  All those stories always have the rat 
[03:37:30]  The one that ruins it for everybody  The party pooper  This guy in Texas, let's say hi to Jeff  Jeff, go ahead  Yeah, I'm in Texas and I can see the launch  Come on  Not really, I just want to call and say papa booey  Papa booey  Ah  Papa booey  Wow  Tell him, Fred!  Papa booey  Yeah, we get it  Oh, wow 
[03:38:00]  That's like a classic call  I don't even know if he's joking or not  It's gotten  It's gotta be a joke  Stop it  No one's really doing that anymore  I really hope that was done ironically  It's gotten to the point it's a parody  So we have no idea if it's real or fake  Welcome to the Larry King Show in 1991  Mom lives by launch her  Mom lives by launch her Hummel's broke  Dave in Florida  Hey guys  What's up, Dave?  Hey, that guy that called from Titusville earlier  That's where I grew up  I actually went to my high school  It was astronaut high school 
[03:38:30]  And my mom just called me  And it reminded me  It was so funny  She said that her Hummel's on her shelf  Fell off and broke  Because the shuttle rumbles so hard  When you're that close  And all I could think of  Is will you have an Opie over for coffee?  Because I was thinking about  Breaking all the little figures  Figurines  What happened to my Hummel?  Opie's more destructive than the space shuttle  All right  Those long cords that were in the news recently  They're choking kids  Kids choking on the long cords  See, I wasn't the only one 
[03:39:00]  But Jay, that thing rocked so hard  It just knocked the Hummel's right off her shelves  They also say not to, like, set your car alarms  And stuff like that  Because the space shuttle will  It's very loud  We'll set those off  Yeah  All right  It's great for watching the animals, too  God, the animals freak  That's the funniest thing in the world  Watching your cat just  Great  All right, thank you, sir  They don't know any better, sir  They don't know what it is  They just, um, they get, um  Well, that guy in, you know  I wonder if you could see that space shuttle  From, uh, like, uh, Richmond, Virginia 
[03:39:30]  At the Funny Bone next week  If you'd be able to see it from there  No, but I'm sure you'll see something blowing up  Time for a sing-along  Fuckin' in the bug  Fuckin' in the bug  I'd like to fuck the shit out of you  I'd like to fuck the shit out of you  I'd like to fuck the shit out of you  I'd like to fuck the shit out of you  Please put my plan in your hand

We'd like to especially dedicate this album  to all the members of the Mickey Mouse Fan Club  and also to you, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are.  And I'd like to fuck the shit out of you 
[03:41:30]  I'd like to fuck the shit out of you  I'd like to fuck the shit out of you  I'd like to fuck the shit out of you  Fucking in the butt  Ah, let's say hi to John in Kansas.  John, what's up? Real fast.  Hey, it's John, but I want to know  what the hell, Voss, the story was.  Yeah, Voss, you've got like two minutes to tell your story.  I'll do it next time.  All right, fun's out.  What do you mean you'll do it next time? 
[03:42:00]  When we were talking about the first time we got laid.  Rich.  I was, uh...  You want to do it or not?  We can end with this.  The first time I got laid, we were talking about here last time  We went to a hotel  Take your time.  Me and my friend  Calm down.  And, uh...  We rented a room  And she said she might rent, you know, the other bed to two other guys  And we go, she'll never do that  So we took the room  We go out and we come back to the room  And she rented a room to five other guys  So what, it was like two queen-size beds?  Yes, and now there's seven guys, strangers 
[03:42:30]  So we go back out and I come back to the room  And some guy's banging a girl  So how old were you?  I was like 18, just turned 18  And then he goes, do you want to bang her?  I go, yeah  So that was the first time I got laid  Then when I walked off, when I was done  There was a line outside my door  And I had like two pumps  And I, you know, I shot a load after like two pumps  Then I went on to the beach  And I just sat and like looked at the sky and stuff  Because it was the end of the first time  I got laid and it was in a trade with a pig 
[03:43:00]  It would have been a better story  When we were talking about the first time  It's fine, Rich, it's good  In a train  You were pulling a train with some pig  And that's your first time  Yeah, but then I went and sat on the beach  Like, you know  Like it was a wonderful moment  Yeah, like sitting there going, oh, finally it happened  And I was like, oh  Was it good?  It wasn't as good as when I used to jerk off with my friend  Yeah  Jimmy's taking a dump  Yeah, he's got to take a dump  He couldn't take it  And I'm percolating  He had to go into the bathroom 
[03:43:30]  He was asking me what stall I'm going to use  But I'm not going  I'll wait  I heard you had some Raisin Bran last night  Yeah  I was at the supermarket  And I was ready to get my cereal  And I saw that Raisin Bran  I'm like, don't do it to yourself, man  I love Raisin Bran  It's the best  It is the best  I got a lower intestine full of lava  Feels like lava is trying to get out  And I'm trying to, you know, keep it contained  I love the lava slide  I'm going to have a Mount St. Helens  I love the lava slide dumps  They're great  No 
[03:44:00]  And then you look down into the bowl  And you're just amazed that that much stuff was in you  No, it's not good  Because not only that, the consistency  But it's very hot  It's very hot  Ben's raw ass  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys  Hey, boss  How's it going?  Good  I learned that not only does little Jimmy tell jokes  But he apparently sings, too  Very good  Watch that  Jimmy can't comment because he's taking a dump  Randy, what did you learn on the show today?
