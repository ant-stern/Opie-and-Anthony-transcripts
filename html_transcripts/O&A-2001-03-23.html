<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on Friday, March 23rd, was a whirlwind of topics, largely centered around a recap of their recent roadshow and a raunchy "Best Ass" contest.  The show opened with a detailed recounting of the roadshow highlights and lowlights.  This included enthusiastic (and sometimes negative) audience reactions to the "Kiss dwarfs" (short men in Kiss makeup lip-syncing), a backstage "golden shower" incident involving Mistress Rhianna and a man named PJ (both of whom called in to discuss their accounts), chaotic crowd disturbances caused by Q-Fart's Pete repeatedly throwing brownies and other objects into the audience, and the overzealous presence of "Stalker Patty."  Comedians Rich Voss and Jim Florentine's performances were also mentioned.  Triple H (from the WWF), along with Mark Carano (WWF publicity), and comedian Brian Regan were scheduled guests, with Regan appearing both in studio during the show and having been a guest the previous night.  Numerous sponsor mentions throughout the show included Rothman's men's clothing, Planet Java, and Avacore.

A large portion of the show focused on the "Best Ass" contest, featuring listener-submitted photos (with some needing reshoots due to poor quality), displayed on the show's website and even featuring some contestants in-studio.  Rick, the show's photographer, detailed the reshoots for one contestant, Debra.  The contest fueled a running gag of inappropriate and suggestive humor throughout the broadcast. This segment overlapped significantly with calls from listeners, notably a man locked in a shed repeatedly begging for help (and receiving only teasing), and another caller expressing anxiety about an eye exam.

Brian Regan's in-studio appearance included stand-up material (such as a bit on fishing shows), conversations about trifocals, and discussions about politically correct terminology regarding people of short stature, with callers providing clarification on the distinctions between "midget" and "dwarf." Frank Caliendo's Brian Regan impersonation from earlier in the day was also discussed.  The show also featured a "FU Friday" segment with listener-submitted messages. Regan's experiences with the show’s antics and the audience, including the “Kiss Dwarves,” were further discussed.

Triple H's appearance included conversations about his relationship with Chyna and the resulting workplace awkwardness after their breakup, speculation about WWF backstage relationships and conflicts (including the departure of the King), discussions of his career, rivalries with Shawn Michaels and Goldberg,  his upcoming WrestleMania match with the Undertaker, and his relationship with Stephanie McMahon.  He also sampled a new Planet Java coffee drink.  Both the Triple H and Brian Regan segments included extended interactions with female callers, featuring ribald humor, suggestive comments, and physical contact (such as spanking and near-kissing) from both the hosts and guests. The show’s frequent use of highly offensive language, especially concerning race and body shaming, was prevalent throughout the entire broadcast,  with the “Best Ass” contest providing ample opportunity for such language.  The show concluded with further updates on the locked-in-the-shed caller and continued discussion of the "Best Ass" contest and WrestleMania anecdotes.

What much? 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  Friday! 
[00:01:00]  Let's go while we're young.  We made it into work today. 
[00:01:30]  What?  What?  People were placing bets all over the place.  I guarantee they'll be in best of mode on Friday.  What?  I guarantee they will not make it in on Friday. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  How are you?  How are you?  Good morning.  It's the O&A Show, and yeah, we are live.  It's Friday, March 23rd, the night after the return of the roadshow.  They're calling it the return of the roadshow, Anthony.  Well, I got to tell you, that was a roadshow.  That was a party and a half. 
[00:02:30]  Jesus.  You know, it has to be said right off the bat, best roadshow we have done since we're moving  back to New York and coming to WNEW.  Best roadshow yet.  Good roadshow yet.  Yeah, that was...  We finally figured out how to do one of these.  Unbelievable.  And make it run smoothly.  Phew.  There were a couple bumps, but in general, it was a good time.  Had by all.  Woo!  Oh, yeah.  Where do we begin?  I think I had a couple of beers last night.  A couple hundred?  A couple.  Look who's talking. 
[00:03:00]  Whatever, Ben.  Oh, between just what was going on on stage, what was going on backstage, the hijinks.  Yeah, we got to get into the whole thing.  Let me...  I'm taking all the people.  It's hot in here.  I'm taking off my shoes, my shirt.  Oh.  Wake up.  I am...  I'm yawning.  I can't stop.  What can I tell you?  The best.  We have a great radio show planned for you today. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  We just found out that Triple H is coming in today.  Triple H.  From the...  Triple H.  From the WWF.  The gamer.  Brian Regan coming in in less than an hour.  He's playing Carolines all weekend long.  We're all going down there, believe it or not, to check out Brian Regan.  We say, believe it or not, because we're just shot.  Oh, God.  We got to support Brian.  The show's going to rock, so get your tickets in advance for Mr. Regan at Carolines this weekend,  okay?  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  And lots more to do, but let's get into the roadshow.  The highlights of the roadshow, Anthony.  Yeah.  My God.  Well, let's start with John, because I think he's way off on this one.  John!  Yeah, what was with the Kiss kids last night?  That was the worst thing.  Rick, when he was announcing them, was his kiddie as a little schoolgirl.  If you didn't find the Kiss dwarfs funny last night, I don't know what else to throw at you.  That was the worst.  That was the worst?  Yes.  I thought it was great. 
[00:04:30]  I thought it was...  Why was Rick so...  He was like...  Everybody was booing.  Like they did the fuel.  John, stick with the facts.  Not everyone was booing.  Most people were laughing their yam bags off when...  Yeah, it was stupid.  ...when Kiss dwarfs came on stage.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thanks, John.  You didn't like it.  That's okay.  Everyone has their opinion.  But...  Yeah, we had...  We had...  We had...  They're called Kiss dwarfs.  Kiss dwarfs.  And full Kiss makeup on the stage. 
[00:05:00]  Lip syncing to three Kiss songs just before we came out last night.  And people were laughing their bullies off.  Yeah.  Little dwarfs with the Kiss makeup on.  They lip synced though.  They don't really do the songs.  So they have these like fake guitars.  They had like guitars made out of cardboard.  But the makeup was good.  Yeah.  And they're dwarfs.  Dwarf equals funny.  Dwarfs in Kiss makeup.  Funny.  Lip syncing to Kiss songs.  Yes.  Funny.  Funny. 
[00:05:30]  Always.  Funny, funny, funny.  Let's go to Wayne.  Wayne, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys sound like...  I had a rough night last night with your voices.  What?  What?  Well, it was a long night.  Yeah, huh?  Funny or what, huh?  We did a full radio show and then we were at the Vanderbilt out there in Long Island for five hours.  Sorry I missed it, man.  Next time.  We put ourselves out there and you can't even come and see us.  Put yourselves out there.  Wayne, you missed a lot of fun. 
[00:06:00]  Later, guys.  Alright.  Let's start with Rich Voss who helped us with the entertainment last night.  Yes.  Rich, you killed last night.  Hey, what's up, man?  Nice.  Nice.  Good set last night.  So much fun.  That audience was great.  They really were great.  I walked on stage just like, I don't know how many people, not one person heckled.  They were unbelievable.  I'm serious.  And I'll tell you the most disturbing thing was watching that video of those two old ladies doing it.  Well, one was an old lady and one was an old man. 
[00:06:30]  One was an old man.  That's the Century Sex video you're talking about?  Oh, yeah.  I couldn't sleep last night.  Yeah, we actually played it.  That was definitely one of the highlights of the night.  We played Century Sex for 1,500 people last night and the reaction was just too good.  Oh, it was so much fun.  And I was saying to Ant, what are the odds that a midget's going to be fat?  Yeah.  Oh, that was so funny.  They don't like being called midgets.  They're dwarfs.  Okay.  The dwarf.  The little fat dwarf.  It's bad enough he's a dwarf.  Yeah.  But he's a little fat dwarf. 
[00:07:00]  He goes, you know, you're a dwarf.  Why do you got to be a fat dwarf?  And if you're a dwarf, wouldn't you just make sure you look your best?  You'd be like a buff dwarf?  Let me take the other side of that.  Why?  I think it's hard to be a small dwarf.  Why?  Well, when you're taller and stuff, the food has many places to go.  Places to go?  Yeah, but when you're small, how much can you eat?  I mean, you've got to stop.  You know what?  Yesterday, I saw I was standing on line to fly to Holland.  I'm at the counter, and the guy said, well, I could fly tomorrow. 
[00:07:30]  I got in my car and I drove out there.  I was so happy.  You know?  Cool.  And this is how unlucky I am.  My plane will probably crash today.  Nah, you'll be fine.  Yeah, I'm on the way to the airport.  I just wanted to call and say I had a great time, and I'm glad I got to go.  Rich, thanks for helping us out, and have a great trip.  All right, man.  I'll talk to you guys later.  You'll have some good stories when you come back, I'm sure.  Oh, I'm sure, yeah.  We could go window shopping.  All right, man.  I'll talk to you later.  Thanks, Rich.  What?  Hold on, Rich.  Oh, you needed him?  What? 
[00:08:00]  Hold on, hold on.  What?  What am I missing?  He was upstairs with Marsh.  Yeah.  While we were on stage and things were happening up in our dressing room, which is,  Vanderbilt's got a great backstage area.  And there's bubble windows over the stage, so you could be up there and look out onto  the crowd and the stage from the privacy of the dressing room area, lounge area.  Which we did when we first got there to check out, you know, the size of the crowd and stuff.  Yeah.  It was pretty cool, because it was packed. 
[00:08:30]  And I just heard while we were on stage, there was all kinds of shenanigans and hijinks happening  up in the dressing room.  I don't know nothing.  I don't know nothing.  But I heard stories that just don't shine any fluorescent lights up in that room.  We were burning and banging.  Oh.  All right.  Well, maybe Psycho Mark will call and confess to something.  Why?  I didn't say who it was.  Is that what you're getting at? 
[00:09:00]  I didn't say anything.  Jim Florentine, who also helped us warm up the crowd and killed last night.  What's up, Jim?  Yeah.  How's it going, man?  Thanks.  It was great last night.  Yeah.  I was a little nervous, man, when I was going out, because I was the first one out.  You know, I just look out, there's a bunch of drunk guys, mostly.  Mm-hmm.  I was a little nervous, but then I'm realizing, well, look what I talk about on stage.  Drinking, sex, hookers, and fat chicks.  So you were in.  The audience you want.  That's my crowd.  Right.  Of course it was.  Yeah, but that was great, man.  It was a really good time.  Well, thank you, man. 
[00:09:30]  We're feeling it today.  Yeah.  So am I.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Jim.  All right, no problem.  Bye.  Pretty hurting.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  I want those dwarfs.  The kiss dwarfs.  How funny was that?  Dude, it rocked.  I want them at my house.  It was hilarious.  All of a sudden, the kiss music starts up and four guys, what, they were no taller than  three and a half feet tall, come walking out in full kiss makeup?  That's funny.  Dwarfs are funny. 
[00:10:00]  There's no doubt about it.  Right.  So you like that part of the show?  I want them, dude.  I want them for a party.  Just dwarfs.  Right on, man.  All dwarfs.  All right.  All right, thanks.  Thank you.  You know, it was quite a moment, that goddamn mistress, Rhianna.  Oh.  Oh.  First of all, no one even knows what took place backstage.  Well, you should explain that.  We were trying to explain it to the crowd, but they were a little loud.  There was a guy.  What's his name? 
[00:10:30]  PJ.  PJ.  Is he part of the Q4s game?  No.  No.  The guy I knew from like way back?  That was Rick.  Yeah.  He, um, he's back backstage with that mistress, Rhianna, who is just a freak.  Just a freaking idiot.  She's the one that blows up her boobs at home.  Right.  She has a huge, like...  She's got the valve under her arm and she can pump them up to whatever size she wants.  Sci-fi boobs.  They are huge.  And she's got the collagen in the mouth that looks like a duck-billed platypus.  She's listening right now, man.  Well, what does she think it looks like? 
[00:11:00]  What?  Well, let's ask her.  She'll call in.  So, um, she comes out on stage with that other chick on the leash.  Yeah.  And I leaned over to the girl on the leash with the ball in her mouth and go, can I kick  you in the heffing face?  And he's like, uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  But backstage, this guy, PJ, somehow, uh, the two of them got together, mistress Rhianna  and, uh, this PJ guy.  He puts his head back over the god-effing ice bin that, like, uh, a half a case of beer 
[00:11:30]  is left in.  Mm-hmm.  And she squats over the ice bin, over his face.  And does?  And does it.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Just, you know, what they call the golden shower.  Mm-hmm.  You know, it might have been great for him.  He's got it all over his head.  He's, he's like, it looked like he was sweating his shirt, his hair.  And he loved it.  He loved the fact that she did this to him.  And meanwhile, all the beer now-  Is ruined.  In that, that water, the yellow water.  You ruined it.  So, um, somebody brought down another half a case of beer. 
[00:12:00]  Cause we were like, we can't drink the beer that's in there.  Although people were drinking the goddamn beer that were in there.  Yeah, Bill wanted to kill somebody.  Yeah, that was just out of control.  You don't wreck good beer.  So then somebody comes down with more beer.  And goes to dump the beer into the ice.  Thinking, oh, they want more beer in the ice.  You-  There were ten guys screaming-  No!  So loud!  And running at him.  That's funny.  But, but you know something? 
[00:12:30]  The yellow water with the ice and the beer.  Um, I came back, you know, 15, 20 minutes later.  All the beer gone out of the yellow ice.  Some people were drinking it.  Walking in, grabbing it up and drinking.  So why did this guy, uh, do this?  I have no clue.  Can we get him on the air today?  I don't know where he is.  I don't know how-  If anything, I think, uh-  How did that come about?  Does anyone know?  I don't even know how they hooked up.  He was backstage.  He knows your brother-in-law.  Oh, he knows Johnny?  Yeah.  Johnny Ray.  Johnny Ray.  Oh, my God. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, but I want to know how that came about and why.  I know.  How did you ask her?  And why would you do it at a road show where now you're walking around with this all in  your hair and on your clothes?  You walked around with, yeah.  Posted 2,000 people.  Well, now Ben, Ben-  Because this happened earlier in the night.  Is this true?  Did PJ hook up with Psycho Mark before this happened?  This guy was so trashed at some point.  I don't even know how he got there.  He comes up to me and goes,  God, me and Rick, I'm together and I'm going to handle the, be the roadie.  And then him and Mark, the guy was just wasted at like three. 
[00:13:30]  Just gone.  So, that was what, nine by then?  All right.  Well, we got to get that guy to call in because I need to know more about that.  Because that was insane.  Because Ann goes, dude, you're not going to believe what Rhianna did to this guy.  I'm like, just, yeah, Lee.  So he's telling me on the stage, I'm like, no way.  And then the kid walks out and he's so...  He's got, like, all this dribble on his shirt.  It was all over.  You know how, like, if you wet your head down and you take your fingers and you run it back so your hair's flicked back?  Either that or, you know, how you look after you sing Naked Cowboy. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Sweater you like a pig.  Right.  Exactly.  But his was, was, was golden shower.  She leaked on his head.  That is just bizarre.  And he was into it and he's walking around like, and I came back and I go, did she do that on your head?  And he's smiling.  Big smile.  Yeah, man.  Like he thought it was the coolest thing ever.  I was horrified.  Well, how are we going to get him on the air?  And then he wants to shake everybody's hands.  Yeah.  He's like, that's okay.  Nah, nah, nah.  Mistress Rhiannon's checking in.  I told her she was listening, Anthony. 
[00:14:30]  That's okay.  Mistress Rhiannon.  Yes.  I think you're lovely.  Thank you very much.  Mistress Rhiannon, did you, how did this happen with you and that PJ guy that you, let's just say, did a golden shower on his head?  Okay.  Well, I was, I was dying to go to the bathroom.  Uh-huh.  I didn't know where the bathroom was.  Right.  And I kept saying, I need a toilet.  Are there any volunteers?  And they brought this guy in and I said, hey, he'll do.  So he put his head over the ice? 
[00:15:00]  Hmm?  He put his head over the ice thing that the beer was in.  That's right.  And then he put napkins over his mouth and I said, hey, wait a second.  That's not going to happen like that.  Remove those napkins.  I need your mouth.  And then I had a.  No way.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  So he did it without any napkins on his face at all and he didn't let loose.  Yeah.  I made him move the napkins, yes, and I had to go for a long time.  That was a long drive. 
[00:15:30]  By the way, guys, my car never showed up.  Ah.  Don't even go into that.  Just tell the story.  I'm telling the story.  Okay.  I just want to say, well, I had a very long drive.  I love the new tune, by the way, Jada.  It's great.  What?  Go ahead, Mrs. Rhiannon.  Okay.  So, yes, I was dying to go to the bathroom and I kept asking someone, where is the bathroom?  So I figured, well, there's nothing better than a human toilet.  And he just fessed up and said, yeah, I'll do it.  Yeah, but they brought him in and I said, okay, good enough.  That's true. 
[00:16:00]  And he laid over the ice.  By the way, guys, there wasn't any beer in that.  A-burst.  Well, I was willing to do it on stage, but things didn't really turn into whatever.  So, you know, next go around for sure.  And I want to bring my girl back.  And I had a whole lot prepared for you guys and we didn't get to do it.  Well, see, you learned a valuable lesson with these road shows.  We've got to get right to the point.  You were kind of like...  Well, I was trying to...  You had a lot of drunk guys that just wanted to see action right away. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Well, I know I was trying to really tease them and entice them.  Oh, there's no teasing.  You can't tease that audience.  No, you've got to get right to it, right?  Yeah.  Look what happened to poor fuel.  We'll get into that in a little bit.  Right.  As a matter of fact, he's on the line.  He wants to talk.  We'll see you soon.  You bet.  You got a plug you want to get out?  Oh, yes.  MrTriannon.com or, of course, boobco.com.  Come visit me.  I'll be at the trade show next week.  In fact, I'm hoping to get in to see you guys in the studio next week sometime so I  can plug my show. 
[00:17:00]  And...  Hey, I'll admit it.  I know she's enjoying herself, but we have to get her in.  I'll be on the cover jet next issue with a tutorial.  Okay.  So, keep an eye out for me.  MrTriannon, we're going to have you in to do what you did backstage.  How's that sound?  Very cool.  As long as we don't talk about it and get too many details, we'll be able to pull that  one off.  Very happening.  And...  We'll be in touch.  You come in next week and do that, all right?  Get that volunteer in there again.  He was good.  We're trying to...  Oh, hold on.  Just press play in stores now.  Hold on.  MrTriannon, you're still on the line, but just be quiet for a second. 
[00:17:30]  Okay.  I heard that.  PJ.  What's going on?  Oh, God.  So, you're the guy?  Yep.  Is this the guy, Rick?  Yeah, that's him.  That's him.  Oh.  PJ.  PJ.  PJ.  I guess the obvious question, why?  Why?  Johnny.  Johnny Race.  Your brother-in-law.  He just pulled me out.  He said, come on.  My brother-in-law, Johnny, got you...  Yeah, Johnny, he's a friggin' lunatic.  Johnny's insane.  He's married to my sister, Dawn.  And he saw Rhiannon, had to go to the bathroom. 
[00:18:00]  So, he ran out and got you and thought you would be a good toilet volunteer?  Exactly.  Now, what would give him that idea?  I have no idea.  Have you ever had this done before?  Nope.  Why did you feel you wanted it done?  I have no idea.  That was out of my mind.  What kind of drugs were you doing?  No, I was drinking.  I was drinking like at one o'clock, so...  Uh-huh.  I...  You know something?  I drank quite a bit.  And there have been occasions where I drank, oh, well, even more.  And never, ever have I wanted anybody to give me a golden shower. 
[00:18:30]  When did you realize that it was a stupid thing to do?  When I woke up this morning.  Did you shower?  Did you shower when you got home?  Well, actually, I showered when I...  Backstage, they had the shower, so I washed my hair and stuff like that.  Yeah, people were showering back...  It was just insane back then.  Yeah, it was just unbelievable.  So, did you enjoy it?  It, uh, tasted like asparagus water.  Oh! 
[00:19:00]  Oh!  Oh!  She comes up to me later on, you know, don't worry, I ate a lot of vegetables.  Mrs. Rhiannon?  Yes.  So, he was good, huh?  He was great.  Yeah.  Very receptive.  Yeah.  Yeah, and when I have to go, I really have to go.  I must have had coarsed and coarsed.  And someone did film it.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  I think it might have been Joe.  I'm not sure, though.  All right, we'll find that date.  Well, thank you, PJ. 
[00:19:30]  No problem, guys.  And Mrs. Rhiannon, we'll see you next week in the studio, all right?  You can.  PJ, we'll have you in, and you can do it again for the radio show.  All right.  As long as I get some beers in.  All right, hold on the line.  All right.  Get his info.  You never know.  What the hell.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Oh, my God.  The glow-in-the-dark boob chick.  No way.  Not on my worst day, man.  That was funny.  Not on my worst day.  That was a pretty rocking show.  He got a little hairy at the end, though, with Q-Fart's guy.  Well, once again, he got thrown out.  Oh, my God. 
[00:20:00]  This guy can get thrown out of anywhere.  I'm walking downstairs, and the security guard drags him back in and says,  oh, your presence is requested upstairs.  I was like, wait a minute.  They just threw him through the door.  He didn't even get through the round door, and he's coming back in.  But that didn't last long.  And they ran back up with him, and I was like, oh, boy.  That just went to hell in a handbasket, that old Steve.  And then, once again, Steve C. had to take him and throw him off the stage.  What was in that bag?  Was that brownies?  Yeah.  It was brownies.  It was real brownies?  It was real brownies. 
[00:20:30]  I wasn't sure, because he pulled out a big brown glob in a plastic bag and then threw  it into the crowd.  You were like, don't throw anything on our listeners, and sure enough, the bag goes right  into the audience.  He's like a chimp.  And the reason we said that is because we know what you guys will do.  Well, you saw what happened.  Oh, my God.  Things started getting thrown on the stage.  And that's when Steve grabbed him and then threw him to the ground.  Q5 is standing there after he throws the brownies into the audience.  There is more crap being hurled on the stage. 
[00:21:00]  Beer cans, cups full of drinks.  I don't know how you stood up to Anthony and was like, get me off this effing stage, man.  I was laughing my ass off.  What about the cup of beer that hit Cowbell Bill?  Cowbell Bill.  I forgot about that.  Hold on, Bob.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  Yeah, the people are throwing stuff at Q5.  Where's Steve?  I mean, stuff is flying from the crowd.  And the more stuff that starts being thrown, the more people say, oh, well, we can throw 
[00:21:30]  stuff.  So even more stuff gets thrown.  And Q5 is standing there with this puzzled look like, why is everyone pelting me?  All of a sudden, a half a cup of beer just flies and hits Cowbell Bill square in the  body.  Boom.  He says, hey, you better have it.  And then at that point, Steve grabs Pete from Q5.  Because he knows that you had to get him off the stage because the people were just pelting.  Yeah, that was escalating.  Also, I got hit in the back of the head with a bottle and that pretty much set me off.  Is that why you kicked him up by the neck and threw him? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  You threw him.  People say they just saw Q5 fly and then land on his ass.  Yeah.  He landed on his head at my feet.  His beer fused up.  I get covered and doused in Qfarts beer.  And you guys got to understand how insane Pete from Qfarts is.  He was going to be the showstopper with his bag of brownies.  So we were counting on this and all of a sudden Ben and Rick and everyone come on the stage  and start whispering to Ant and I, like, uh.  He's already been thrown out.  We had bad news.  He's been thrown out and he's been told never to return to this venue again. 
[00:22:30]  And now we're like, well, we still need, like, something to leave the people with.  Some kind of showstopper.  I'm like, uh, uh.  So we're trying to figure it out on stage.  And then all of a sudden one of the huge bouncers comes to me and goes, you guys really need him back here?  And I'm like, yeah.  I'm like, alright.  So he goes on his little walkie-talkie thing.  Next thing you know, we got Pete from Qfarts back in the venue.  Yeah.  So this is how insane the guy is.  You would think he would behave and be cool.  Oh, no.  Because now he's on complete thin ice.  Yeah.  He's been brought back from the dead. 
[00:23:00]  Brought back from the dead.  So he goes, I need the microphone.  These mother effers threw me out of this place.  I'm like, will you shut up?  You gotta love the guy.  He's got the biggest set of balls.  It's like, it took an act of God to get you back in.  And that's the first thing you're going to say?  And he was on stage for probably four minutes.  Yeah.  Five minutes before he was really forcibly removed from the stage and the venue.  So then he's teasing.  He pulls out the bag that looks like it could be brownies.  It could be something else.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  And then he takes a glob of it and throws in the audience.  I'm like, we're done.  This is going to be just a mess.  And then he puts the rest in his mouth.  And then, and then everybody starts just pelting.  Yeah.  That's where the story picked up.  Poor Bill.  Kyle Bell Bill sitting there minding his own business behind the drums just waiting to  play a tune and whack a big friggin' cup of beer hits right in the forehead.  I was roaring laughing at that point.  I love the huge warning you guys gave Pete.  Pete, don't mess with the audience. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Don't piss them off.  Okay, he's nodding.  He's not the first thing he does.  Throws the bag into the crowd.  Throws it into the audience.  The guy has got the biggest set of balls.  Amazing.  Pretty funny though.  Uh, let's go to Ron.  What's up?  Hey, great effin' show last night.  That really rocked.  I mean, it was our best one to date.  Oh, man.  I wasn't allowed to go without my wife.  You went with your wife, okay?  Yeah, so, uh...  Is she a fan of the show?  Uh, she listens every once in a while. 
[00:24:30]  Alright.  I got her, well, she was watching the puke when they were drinking the milk.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we'll get into that a little later.  And, uh, the 80-year-old woman?  Yeah.  I was like, oh, yeah, that's just what I need to see.  Century Sex.  At Century Sex, she's close to 100.  Yeah, well...  The reaction came on.  The reaction when we played, like, I don't know, 20-30 seconds of Century Sex is priceless.  We might have to play that on the air today.  I thought there was going to be a little, like, kind of subdued part of that tape or something. 
[00:25:00]  It started right out with just a yam bag slapping her ancient paint.  I was like, whoa, you guys got right into it.  Nice cue up on this thing.  And at first, I mean, you're like, okay, not too bad.  Yeah.  I'm not going to lie.  I mean, it was still messy down there.  But you're like, eh, it's not too bad.  The slow pan up the body.  The slow pan up the body, and it just gets uglier and uglier and uglier.  And then when you see the face, the face that should only be seen in a casket.  Yeah, she's like, oh, that's just what I need to see.  My grandmother having sex. 
[00:25:30]  That might be the highlight of the night right there.  Because to see 1,500 people react like that at one time, I know.  And we heard it.  Oh!  All right, Ron.  Okay.  Thank you.  Well, we've got to take our first break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Here's the deal.  We've got pictures up on WNEW.com.  I believe.  Did Steve from FoundryMusic.com start posting pictures yet?  Not yet.  Yeah, well, he had to go to work today, so.  Yeah, we'll thank everybody.  We're coming back and we'll do a little more on the Roadshow. 
[00:26:00]  There's still a lot to talk about.  Fuels on hold to talk and others, so stay there, okay?  And also, don't forget, Brian Regan coming in at 4 and Triple H for the WWF at 5 o'clock in studio.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  Rainwreck radio.  Rainwreck radio.  Rainwreck.  Rainwreck.  Rainwreck.  Rainwreck.  This is sicker than Faces of Death.  1827 WNEW.  Anthony Tom checking in from The Drinking Game. 
[00:26:30]  Opie, I'm sure your brother did not like to kiss dwarfs.  My brother, Brett, got pissed at me.  Oh, that's right.  If you follow the show very closely, he is scared of dwarfs.  He's got to tell that story on the air again.  It goes back to my mom locking him in the car while she was going shopping and a dwarf was harassing him as he was locked inside the car.  So last night, all of a sudden, he elbows me and goes, he didn't tell me there were going to be dwarfs here. 
[00:27:00]  And he was really pissed.  Yeah.  Because it really freaks him out.  He got freaked out.  Brings him back to when he was like 8 years old, trapped in the car with a dwarf outside the window making faces and stuff and freaking him.  Well, that's like you if you went over his house and all of a sudden five people there with vacuums.  True.  You'd be like, hey, what are you doing?  True, true, true.  Yeah.

[00:28:30]  It's like a drug.  102.7.  WNW.  Duke and Duke.  The O&H show.  Brian Regan should be in studio in about 20 minutes.  Yeah.  A little later on, Triple H on the WWF.  Yep. What happened to Bubba Ray, Barry from Jersey wants to know. He was really cool and funny the last time he was in. Bubba Ray is sick. Yep. So he will be in here another day. But the WWF said, hey, Triple H is around him. And we're like, cool. Send him down. What do you got there? 
[00:29:00]  A letter from Stalker Patty. Oh, great. I had to tell Stalker Patty at the end of the night not to stalk my brother-in-law, Fish. Yeah. My brother-in-law was like, oh, well, Stalker Patty, introduce me. So I go, Stalker Patty, this is my brother-in-law, Fish. And I go, please don't stalk him. He's got two, you know, lovely children. And he doesn't want to be bothered. Right. You have to do those types of things when she's around. 
[00:29:30]  I had a deal with her after you left and after we got done playing. She's standing there and she's like, can I ask you what personal thing? And the people around, they start laughing. I'm like, Patty, what are you doing? You're like, you know, the truth, what's it? And I got to ask, I said, ask me. I'm upset at OP. She was upset with you. Patty, we'll talk about it tomorrow. All of a sudden, I'm in a relationship. 
[00:30:00]  I have to say things like, Patty, we'll talk about it tomorrow. What is she upset with? I don't know. I wasn't at all that she was said. She was upset with you.  I don't know. I don't even look at her anymore. She said something or did something. I don't know. That's how we treat her on the air. But, you know, tough love. It's tough love.  Sure, sure. So she wrote a letter. I haven't even read this, but wow, you guys kicked butt yesterday. It was a great show.  So, Anthony and Joey and their band really rocked. And, Anthony, you surprised me as I've never heard you perform before. 
[00:30:30]  I hope I have plenty more opportunities to see Rock Gut. I really enjoyed the entire set.  Also, Dawn was great, too. You have a very talented family, Anthony.  Why didn't you send it to the family instead of you?  I also love Joe's guitar playing. He's cool.  That's right. Joe Cool, they call him.  The 15-second film of the Century Sex People caught me off guard.  I didn't think such an exercise, in parentheses, was possible in people that age. 
[00:31:00]  Well, get used to it because if you ever get laid, that's what it's going to look like, Patty.  The lady looked like a skeleton. Did she really feel anything?  She looked dead.  I thought I was watching necrophilia.  I sure had an educational moment there.  The mini-kiss band was hilarious, and those little guys were so cute.  They horrify my brother. He better call in because he's pissed at me. 
[00:31:30]  I would have liked the midget YouTube band.  I'm glad I don't have the stomach of Q farts.  He must have had a bad case of Pika?  Piker?  All right.  Who does he think he is? Ozzy Osbourne?  Oh, I'm waiting for the boy to bite the head off a pigeon next.  Well, I had a great time. I was glad to be the first one online. 
[00:32:00]  It's a letter from a lunatic.  As you're worth it.  First one on the line and last person to leave the Vanderbilt last night.  Yep.  You could have a road show on the planet Jupiter.  I would find a way to get there.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  I'd call down, but I'm too scared to.  Ha.  Have a great day.  Oh, so she wrote this upstairs.  I'm up.  Delivered.  Fans.  This guy was on the train with Patty. 
[00:32:30]  Walt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Good sausage fest last night.  Yeah.  We got to figure out a way to get more ladies there, man.  Yeah, man.  Let's not fake it.  I mean, there was over 1,500 people there, maybe 200 ladies.  Yeah, I got it.  I said like two wows.  Anyway.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's stick to the fact.  There was a lot of wowing.  The girls that were there were good sports.  Yep.  You can see it for yourself on www.com if you think I'm lying.  Girls on shoulders, showing cans.  It was great. 
[00:33:00]  The wowing was good.  So what's up?  I was on the railroad on the way home.  Yeah.  And Stalker Patty was on the same car as I was.  Oh, really?  Last one to leave, too.  It was like 2 o'clock in the morning.  And she was almost set off at the wrong stop.  She's like, is this the one for the beat train?  Did you have any opportunity, sir, to push her under the wheels of the train?  No.  I couldn't bring myself to do it.  Pussy.  What was she saying?  But since she saw my wow shirt, she's asking me, oh, you were at the show?  She was like, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  She's like, oh, isn't Q Fart crazy?  He's crazy.  And I was just like, yeah, this isn't the right show.  It was a fart title.  But she's like, it's worth it.  I love them dearly, you know.  Oh, my God.  Is she something.  And she tried to keep talking.  I just wanted to get on the train and get home.  I was exhausted and drunk.  Hey, can we have Triple H's Body Slam Stalker Patty today?  That'd rock.  That would rock.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Patty would do pretty much anything for our show.  Ask her if she would take a body degree.  For the pedigree from Triple H. 
[00:34:00]  You know what I love now?  Listeners are calling and doing the patty voice.  Yeah.  Sweeping the nation, Rick.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's going on?  Eric.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  What's up, man?  What's going on, guys?  Thanks.  I was at the rock show last night.  Have a good time?  Oh, I had a great time.  First, I have an apology for Anthony.  What?  Well, the last couple of days, you were saying that you were going to be singing and doing  the Naked Cowboy.  And I kind of had a doubt in my mind that, you know, it's just really going to suck. 
[00:34:30]  And I really must say, you can kick.  Anthony, my friend, can sing.  Thank you, man.  It was cool.  We got everybody up there and had a great time.  I mean, you know, we don't get to do that that often.  I did make the one in Long Beach in Island Park.  Yeah.  But I made this one, and I made the one from Mulcahy's, me and my friend.  And this one, man, it kicked.  It kicked ass.  It was a great show.  A lot of people, well, there was still a pretty big crowd. 
[00:35:00]  Anthony's band, Mr. Rotate Ahead, they played for like an hour and a half.  Yeah, we played the road show.  Quite a while after it was done, just, you know, for anybody that wanted to hang out.  I think we hung around for the second song that you were playing after everybody left.  Yeah, the hardcore crowd hung out for quite a while.  I think they played about 20 songs after we ended the road show.  I wouldn't doubt it.  All right, all right.  I wouldn't doubt it.  And I have one other thing.  All right, you know, next time, the guys that are, you know, hanging off the side of the stage.  Yeah.  Especially kind of like that SF Earl. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  We kept telling him and everybody else.  Oh, I'm kidding.  They go, isn't that painful?  Like, waiting for every word to come out.  I wasn't sure if something was going to happen.  I hear you.  You had to stick with it that long.  Chris, what's going on?  That's why we got to start the train.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  We need the train.  Chris, what's going on?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, let's go.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey, listen, I was actually shocked that Anthony could sing last night.  It's what I did before I did radio.  It was like, song and sang and sang. 
[00:36:00]  I've known Opus since his West Babylon days, but I've never seen Anthony sing before.  I could not believe how good you actually were.  I didn't even know the road show was over.  We were just sitting there listening.  You turned around, half the crowd was gone.  Yeah.  But, you know, you should have done.  You could have filmed the darts that stalked a patty last night.  But the other thing...  Hugh Guy, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I had a great time.  Hold on a second.  Yeah.  Now, you know, when you come out to this, that's an attention-getter. 
[00:36:30]  With my Saturday Night Fever.  Tony Manero suit on.  Of course, the white suit.  There's pictures of it on www.com.  Yes.  Rocks, right?  We used to do a whole set of stuff.  I wish it is what we did last night. 
[00:37:00]  It's a nice feeling.  Oh, look, a lot of the pictures are up.  Yeah, it is.  I'm thinking up, man.  We got the song playing and a picture of Anthony in the suit on www.com.  Did you like the Tony Manero moves?  It was nice, yeah.  All I needed was the light-up dance floor.  That was cool.  Fuel checking in, Anthony.  Fuel.  Fuel, what's going on, bud?  Took my lumps.  Well, man, we got to explain what happened to Fuel.  You're a brave soul, my friend.  Moral of the story, no jazz experimentation for a festival crowd. 
[00:37:30]  That's right.  No, but see, you left the stage killing, though.  You decided, Fuel gets up there to do a couple songs,  and he decides in front of 1,500 screaming lunatics  that he's going to try out a new song.  Jazz, all the same.  Our bass player wrote this.  Derek Smoles.  Yeah, Fuel, man.  You got to open with the hit.  No patience, those people.  None.  No, absolutely not.  You're right.  Let's learn.  I'm a big boy.  You can't get enough to flee. 
[00:38:00]  The road show, I mean, it's all about just, you know,  getting right into it.  And, of course, after that, I...  Hey, I like the new song, to be honest with you.  The new song is actually good.  It's good, but they never heard it before.  When you go see Rush, and they start playing their new material,  you're like, what the F, man?  I want to hear Spirit of Radio.  I want you to open and close with the final countdown.  So...  Get out.  No, but Baby Raper Killed.  Yeah, that was good.  It's really creepy to hear 1,500 people, you know,  singing along, singing that song. 
[00:38:30]  It's not right.  It always gets that weird reaction from the people  that really don't know the show,  that were dragged to the road show.  Yeah, yeah.  What are they singing about?  They're singing that?  1,500 of them?  With smiles on their faces.  Oh, yeah, they love that.  But, Fuel, thank you.  You did very well.  I do my part.  Lesson learned.  All right.  No, no, no, you were fine.  Hey, you did much better than Vinny the Racist did.  And you didn't crack, because what happens,  you never want this to happen to you  if you're performing at one of our road shows  when the crowd starts their Be More Funny chant. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  Whoa.  That's brutal.  I mean, that is really brutal.  Yeah.  It makes a lot of people cringe backstage.  And you just, you didn't miss a beat.  You said, okay, you don't want this one, all right.  And then you went right into Baby Rafer  and you brought them right back.  What are you going to do, right?  You were fine, Fuel.  My reward for that after I went backstage  was to grab one of those beers out of that bucket.  Talking about the, yeah.  I was standing there and somebody was like,  oh, yeah, you know what's on that beer?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Lynch had one and I had one. 
[00:39:30]  We both threw them.  All right, Fuel.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Thanks, later.  Talking about the ice bucket that was filled with  you-know-what from it.  Yeah.  She did her thing on that kid's head.  Say no mo.  Say no mo.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Did you hear?  Dude, I can't even take pot shots at you, bro.  You got the biggest set of baldies, man.  These pictures are off the hook, yo.  Off the hook, yo.  Tony is hell, man.  Nice suit.  You like the John Travolta suit? 
[00:40:00]  Loving it, dude.  I have clothes like that.  My old, we have like the 70s replica closet.  The old brown leather jacket.  The butterfly shirts.  Hey, Tony, you weren't at the show?  Nah, I couldn't make it.  My jackass.  Can I give him a F you?  My jackass boss who sucks the biggest C ever.  You bite.  Yeah.  Dude, unreal, man.  You guys rock.  Wow, and he's enjoying the pictures.  The pictures that he wasn't even there.  Yeah.  I know, dude.  It's like being there.  All right, Tony.  Later, boys.  Thank you.  Wait, we'll get some video up. 
[00:40:30]  It'll be great.  Very soon, yes.  Oh, look who's coming into the studio.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Brian's here.  Brian Regan.  I just entered the studio.  He doesn't know what to do.  Should I sit down or should I wait for them to finish this break?  All right, we've got to talk to our stalker for a second here.  Stalker Patty.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Oh, let me just explain that moment with Anthony. 
[00:41:00]  That moment?  We had a moment?  Oh, no.  That's not.  You know what I mean when I tried to talk to you a little bit privately.  All right.  Just for two seconds to make sure everything was okay between, you know, me and the two  of you because I, you're acting like we have a relationship.  No, that's not the, you know, the thing is.  A relationship doesn't have to be a sexual relationship.  A relationship could be like what we have with Brian Regan even, like kind of this casual, 
[00:41:30]  hey, how are you doing?  You know.  Yeah.  Right.  We don't have a relationship with you.  All I meant was that on Monday, you know, talking about people spitting in my food and  stuff like that, and I didn't understand that.  I don't know where that came from because it was just out of the blue.  Uh, it's because we're angry, and you say stuff when you're angry.  What would you be angry at me for?  I didn't do anything.  I know.  You just don't get the hint that, you know, you're around too much. 
[00:42:00]  Uh-huh.  Like, why did you have to be the last one to leave the venue and talk to Anthony?  I wasn't the last one to leave.  I left with a friend, and it was like about 200 people there when I was leaving.  What time did you leave last night?  I left at about 1.25.  Most people were in bed for three hours. 
[00:42:30]  The regular road show ended at 11-ish.  Yeah.  And then Anthony's band played for a good hour after that.  Uh-huh.  And then Anthony's band left the stage about 12.15.  I mean, you left an hour after that, even.  An hour?  Patty, you were one of the last people to leave.  You were the first to get there, which is cool, and the last to leave.  Don't you think that's a little strange?  No.  There were people there when I left.  Who were you hanging around with?  The guy sweeping up. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, there were a lot of people there.  Yeah?  I was talking to a lot of people.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, man, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, make that bitch cry, will you?  Make her cry.  I'm in my car.  I wouldn't hear that bitch cry.  No, I think we've got to hang up with Patty so we can get to Brian Regan, really.  All right, cool, man.  Patty, what else?  What else?  Because we've got to go.  That's about it.  Nothing much.  I just want to make sure that, you know, I'm still a friend of the show.  That's all.  Oh, always. 
[00:43:30]  You were never a friend of the show, though.  Oh, stop it.  I know you don't mean that.  I didn't, you know.  What is it going to take for her to believe something I say?  Adam wants to know what in the world in your childhood makes you grow up talking like Patty.  How does she get that speech cadence and accent?  Whatever it is.  Patty, what is that?  Where were you born?  Oh, I was born in the city.  What city?  New York City.  You were born in New York City, raised in New York your whole life. 
[00:44:00]  Then why do you talk like that?  Well, I can't believe it.  Oh, say I was there until I guess 1-15.  I don't know.  It's just the way I talk.  I didn't talk until I was almost four.  You know, it's just the way I talk.  So you were almost four?  You didn't say a word?  No.  When did your kids start talking?  It's like one.  One.  So, what, as poor did you finally say hello?  I don't think I thought it was funny. 
[00:44:30]  Patty, what were your first words?  I don't even know.  Catch her in the rye.  You should have remembered.  No.  All right, hold on.  We get this every time.  Teresa.  Teresa, say your piece.  Teresa.  Why are you guys so mean to her?  Because she just, no one gets it.  I guess you have to be around us to get it.  Well, I mean, I.  Every time, wouldn't you be creeped out if every time you left your place of business, 
[00:45:00]  Patty was there and she always has an excuse why she just happened to be there?  I have a guy that does that to me.  And I, he just, yes, it does creep me out.  All right.  And she thinks we're kidding.  And I don't know what else to tell her.  I told her, you know, without trying to make a bid out of it, that it's a little weird.  But she sounds such like the little lost puppy dog that you're kicking around and, you know.  Teresa.  You haven't, you haven't seen her stare at you.  Okay.  It's a little strange. 
[00:45:30]  My brother-in-law even said, man, that is some look she's got going.  All right, you guys.  All right, Patty, are we done today?  Yeah, but I don't, I'm not there when you leave.  You were upstairs, what, ten minutes ago, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, and I had to write a note.  Were you at the Brooklyn Diner today?  Oh, no, I probably got home too late last night.  Were you at the Brooklyn Diner today?  Um, Wednesday I was. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Well, we're going to let you go, Patty.  I'm glad you had a good time, and thanks for supporting our show.  Oh, you're welcome.  I always do, and I tell everybody else about it, too.  Great.  Oh, is this coffee?  What?  Someone just put Planet Java coffee in front of me.  What is this?  It's cyanide.  It's good stuff.  We'll be talking about Planet Java later, okay?  Oh, okay.  Someone finding an opportunity to plug.  Mm-hmm.  Who gave you the coffee?  Um, Eddie came up and just put it right in front of me. 
[00:46:30]  Live in law, live in law, live in law.  I don't know where it came from.  No.  All right, Patty.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes, Stalker Patty.  Whew.  Anthony, Brian Regan in the studio.  We'll talk to him next, okay?  Yes.  Playing Carolines all this weekend.  You guys, get on the phones now and get your tickets, because it's a lot of fun.  We're all going down right after the show to check him out, okay?  Right.  And we'll talk to him next.  Hey, this is John Madden. 
[00:47:00]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony on 102.7, W-N-E-W.  That's a W at the beginning and a W at the end and an E in the middle.  That's a direction on the compass.  Hey, Anthony, Stalker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Something I think a lot of our listeners need today, because it gives you that boost of energy.  Oh, yeah, I need that.  Also, it can help you lose some of the weight, because it burns the fat.  And what else?  Oh, it crushes the cravings to snack in between meals, right? 
[00:47:30]  It's up to loosen weight, Opie.  But more importantly, for everyone that was at the road show last night,  it gives you that boost of energy after you take it.  45 minutes after taking it, right?  Kind of hard to get through the day when I woke up and I thought it was Saturday,  because last night felt so much like a Friday night.  Then you realize, oh, boy, got to pull another show out of our ass.  Oh, that's why Brian Regan's here.  We're just going to say, hey, Brian, be funny, Mr. Funny Man.  Be funny.  And we're just going to sit back and watch.  You must love the bad Brian Regan impression. 
[00:48:00]  And now that it's sweeping the nation.  Also sweeping the nation.  We have all our listeners doing it, though.  They call up and go, hey, where's Brian coming in?  When is he going to come back?  Where's Brian?  Talk like he talked.  I feel weird cutting Stalker Patty off, man.  She's going to transfer some of this energy my way.  She'll be out at the club.  How come?  I can't do a Stalker Patty impression.  I wanted to talk to them, and you had to come in and ruin it. 
[00:48:30]  You're going to take a pot shot at you, man.  You've got to watch her.  Oh, that's funny.  She's doing all right, huh?  Yeah, she's fine.  Yeah, we, uh, whatever.  She's patty.  If we say we love her, then, you know, you know what that could mean.  Oh, be with Stalker.  You feel the results 45 minutes after taking it.  Guarantee.  Not another knockoff fat furnace.  Stalker is twice the strength to any of those Metaba products.  You can take one little yellow capsule, not two or three pressed herbal horse tablets.  You don't want to do that.  How it works, it burns the fat, and you eat less. 
[00:49:00]  So eating less, you lose weight.  There you go.  You eat what you want.  You just don't eat like a pig.  You want to lose 10 pounds or 100 pounds, 100 pounds.  Oof.  Stalker 2 works.  Call them 1-800-LITELINE, 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E, or log on to Stalker2.com, Stalker2.com,  or you can go to GMC, Genevieve ShopRite, and other fine stores.

[00:49:30]  This is 1027-WNEW, New York.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Jimmy wants in real fast here.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to say I saw Brian last night.  Yeah.  Caroline?  Yeah.  Yo, you were off the hook, yo.  Off the hook, yo.  I was just kind of upset that he didn't do his John Madden impersonation there.  He doesn't do his John Madden impersonation.  He's trying to make a joke, sir.  I'm sorry, guys.  Was that you being funny? 
[00:50:00]  No, not really.  Just being stupid.  Oh.  Sorry, guys.  All right.  That's just Frank Caliendo, who does the John Madden impression, was doing the Brian  Regan impression.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  I'm slow today.  Yeah.  He does do a great impression to you.  Do we have that?  I've got to work on a Madden in the meantime.  Yeah.  He does a great Madden.  God damn, the guy sounds just like him.  We got him looking at pictures of our best ass.  It's supposed to be concentrating on the show.  It is.  Brian looks over on my screen. 
[00:50:30]  Brian, my picture is naked women over there.  I'm just looking at Mira.  Mira, whose photos were taken, what, yesterday?  Myra?  Myra, yeah.  I would say firmly entrenched in the lead in my book.  Jesus Christ, that's an ass.  Today's the last day that the girls can come down and show off their asses, Brian.  How many contestants?  We have about, look at this, 20 probably.  Yeah.  See?  There's a whole bunch of them.  Look at it, man.  Look at this one.  40 cheeks.  Right there. 
[00:51:00]  Great.  And they show their ass.  They take pictures.  And there's a prize?  Oh, yeah.  A trip to Vegas.  Man, oh, man.  And then we put their pictures.  We whittled it down to a few finalists.  And then we put their pictures on the website.  And the listeners get to vote for the best ass on the Opie and Anthony show.  And thank you, Pickle Hornigowie, for sponsoring that.  Is there a lady out there?  Or is she doing business with the station?  What is she doing?  She's there for a reshoot.  A reshoot?  Yeah.  One of those pictures is getting reshotted?  I wasn't putting my best ass forward or whatever. 
[00:51:30]  I didn't have my best cheek forward.  Well, you know what happened?  There was a problem.  Some of the earlier contestants, if I could show you, Brian, if you look at contestant one  or two, the pictures, very clinical.  It looked like a frigging lipo ad or something, you know?  Yeah.  And then.  What kind of photographer you had to take a no shot?  Yeah.  And then as we go down to, like, you know, a couch is involved. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  That's the whole day.  That's unfair, man.  The chick's on all fours.  I mean, look at this.  Look at this.  A couch with schoolgirl dresses, stockings, a spanking going on.  And then now let's go back to, let's say, contestant two and see what we got here.  Completely unfair disadvantage there.  Hey, show them Patty.  Oh, yeah.  Once you talk about Patty, actually enter.  Here's her. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Look at that.  Look at that.  All right.  Okay.  I don't like to speak, you know.  Good for her.  Speak, Bill.  You spoke volumes.  My brother, that.  Hey, Anthony, we found Frank Caliendo doing Brian Regan.  Oh, he did?  All right.  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  You had Regan on?  Oh, yeah.  Regan, what?  Imagine if we go, yeah, he saw it.  We're going to edit all that out, right?  Well, we got it out.  What a pain in the ass, that guy.  Like a pompous ass.  He's limo.  Oh, I didn't realize that was all in this clip. 
[00:53:00]  I'm sorry, Brian.  All right.  Here, Frank Caliendo.  You had Regan on?  Oh, yeah.  Regan, one of our faves.  Well, you're going to go over here.  I've got a joke for you.  Here's a little joke.  I'm going to move over to the side.  Now, move over.  You can't see it on the radio.  You can't see me moving on the radio.  You saw me move.  It would have been a funny move, man.  That's one of the funniest humans alive.  Brian.  It is great, man.  I'm going to get a jelly donut. 
[00:53:30]  Give me a jelly donut.  Give me, give me, give me, what are you doing?  I said Brian Regan's timing.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do with your timing?  Do you John Madden?  Do you John Madden, Norm Macdonald?  What about Norm Macdonald working at McDonald's?  Do you want to bet?  Do you want to bet for your impressionist guy?  I'm really getting into it now.  Mr. Impressionist guy.  I know he's really nice, too, and I'm making him sound like he's mean.  Oh, we love him. 
[00:54:00]  What's going on over here?  What are you doing?  Doing impressions?  Doing funny voices?  That's good.  I like that.  Work on it.  Work on it sometime.  Work on it.  Do it better.  Do it better.  Do it.  More people call in.  Call in saying, do a better job.  There it is.  Oh, man.  That's pretty good, huh?  That's great.  Frank Kelly.  Isn't that weird?  Somebody just like trying to do you.  Do your voice.  I'm embarrassed because I can't live up to that, man.  I'm like a bump in a log after Frank. 
[00:54:30]  Vito.  Hey.  What's up?  O&A.  First time I got a chance to talk to you.  It's a cool thing.  Brian.  Yes.  My God.  I was there last night.  We were like front table.  You were hysterical.  Hey, thanks for coming out.  Oh, my God.  That wasn't me, though.  That was Frank Caliendo.  Oh, no.  I saw you.  I've heard Caliendo, but no, that was, oh, my God.  You were so funny last night.  I appreciate that.  Made my birthday, and thanks.  Man, happy birthday.  Next.  I'm telling you guys, we're going tonight.  Yeah, we say it every time Brian's in town. 
[00:55:00]  He's got to be good because we are really, really tired and spent after last night, but  we are going tonight.  Still going.  I know.  Still going.  Rick was saying you guys had, like, a midget, a midget kiss group or something?  Yeah.  I don't know if that's a politically correct word.  Well, they don't like being called midgets.  They want to be called dwarves.  Dwarves.  All right.  Is that true?  Yeah.  And they were all in the kids' makeup.  Dwarves or dwarves?  Dwarves.  Dwarves.  I don't know.  Dwarves.  Kiss dwarves.  Kiss dwarves.  Little dwarves. 
[00:55:30]  Little people.  That's cool, man.  Yeah, they came out with all the makeup on, and they were the lip sync.  They didn't really play.  Oh.  You know, that would have been all that.  My God, if they played.  Imagine that.  That is hilarious.  They walk on stage with their little bodies all dressed in the kiss makeup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a freak show last night.  I'm sitting here feeling bad I said midget before.  I didn't realize it was politically incorrect.  Look at you.  Look at you.  I'm trying to say a good thing about the kiss group, and I come right off with the wrong  term.  How do you know?  And then look like midget. 
[00:56:00]  Midget doesn't seem okay.  Dwarves doesn't seem okay.  Dwarves like a cartoon thing, right?  Everything gets switched.  Everything you say for a while, then you can't say.  I can't say it anymore.  Yeah.  But I'm always the last to find out.  And you always say the wrong thing.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Dwarves.  Dwarves now says.  Dwarves colored oriental midgets.  You can't say that.  Remember when oriental was fine?  Yeah.  For a long time.  For a damn long time.  You can't say that anymore.  It's like, no, oriental is a, that is an object, can be oriental. 
[00:56:30]  We are Asian.  What?  What the hell did that happen?  It's an oriental rug.  Rug.  Right.  But an Asian person standing on the oriental rug.  Right.  Got it.  Hey, you know what's weird?  This week.  The girl really dressed up for her reshoot.  This is the reshoot.  Let's see.  Should we bring her in a little bit?  Yeah, bring her in.  Now, is Rick going to be doing another clinical?  You know, Rick's kind of learned.  Screen and.  Yeah.  Isn't that horrible?  It looks like a liposuction ad.  It's like a, like a proctologist, you know, handbook or something. 
[00:57:00]  Before and after.  You came in for a reshoot?  Yes.  What was wrong with your original pictures?  Didn't like them?  Did you look at number six?  No.  Your contestant number six.  You're a personal number six.  Nice to talk at a town.  I'm out on a street going.  Did you see number six?  We're talking about it on Friday.  Controversy.  Oh, was this the one where your fingers are on the bottom?  Oh, yeah.  What is that? 
[00:57:30]  That's my hand.  Okay.  We want to know if something was popping out of the G-string.  No, it would be in totally wrong place if that were the case.  Yeah.  Well, I don't even understand what that could be.  Well, that's Brian.  No, that's my hand.  You can see where my arms are.  See this right here?  Oh, I see.  Yeah, but it's her fingers because she's kind of like that.  But a lot of people thought, you know, getting the shot ready, right?  I mean, you know, they thought that and it makes them happy.  And, hey, I'll be good at it.  Hey, you didn't say hi to Brian Reagan.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm doing good.  How are you?  What do you wear for the reshoot?  Okay.  Yeah, sure.  All right. 
[00:58:00]  Why couldn't we have a race there?  How easy was that, man?  Yeah, right?  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  Got a little bong on.  Bravo.  Very nice.  All right.  Go get your...  Wow.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, look at that.  Bravo.  That's good.  Nice.  Well, go get the pictures of Reagan and we'll have you back in a little bit, okay?  Your money's in on number six there.  But the reshoot is always fun and exciting, Opie, because things are going to really come 
[00:58:30]  ahead.  What do you see, Brian?  Well, I can see, you know, I think the picture didn't do her justice.  Yeah.  See?  Right.  You know, you just saw this live.  There's a weird shadow thing going on.  And this one, whoa, a little glare.  Right.  It doesn't look good to there.  And this view with the fingers coming through, it looks like something's poking out of the  bottom of a thong, resembling a piece of veal. 
[00:59:00]  Kevin's going to help Brian Reagan with the midget dwarf thing.  Ah, good.  Kevin?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Kevin.  Good.  How's it going, Brian?  Good.  There's a technical difference.  A midget is someone under four feet tall who's perfectly proportioned.  They have a regular-sized head, regular-sized arms for little bodies.  A dwarf is that little, tiny body with the big head.  So, basically, doctors differentiate between the two.  Got it now.  Ah.  So, if these little kids guys had those, you know, those big heads and those funny little 
[00:59:30]  legs, then they're dwarves.  They're not midgets.  They each got their own different associations.  There's midgets of America, and there's dwarves of America.  Now, the midgets don't get along with the dwarves?  Apparently not, no.  The dwarves get all the attention, you know, but everybody, I mean, you make fun of the dwarves  more, but the midgets, you know, they don't get enough.  It's my recognition.  There's this whole little war going on that we don't even know about.  Can you imagine that, you know, both groups book a convention in the same hotel, and, like,  they don't know about the other group, and then, oh, no, there's bad blood in the lobby, 
[01:00:00]  man.  The midgets and the dwarves are...  When you're a dwarf, you're a dwarf all the way.  Who are you calling a dwarf?  I'm a midget.  Do I look like I'm in proportion?  Do I look like my arms and legs are proportional to the rest of my body?  Who are you calling a midgety?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  All right, let's go to Brooks.  Another girl showed up to get her pictures done for the Best Ass Contest.  Last day that the girls can come down.  Oh, there's a new girl.  Yes.  Brooks, what's up?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, Brian, when's your next CD coming out, buddy?  Don't know.  I don't have any short-term plans.  I'm, like, lame at planning my career out.  Everybody else has all kinds of goals and aspirations.  I'm like, hey, I never even thought about that.  Maybe I should do another one.  You just go and do your gigs and do the shows and fly home. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, you ever thought about getting on TV?  You know, I see these other guys do it.  They seem to be making a lot of money.  I got to go out and do something like that.  No, you're right, man.  I appreciate, you know, hopefully you'd want to check it out.  You've got to write one of those wacky comedy books, too, Brian.  That's right, because we all downloaded it.  I mean, bought the first CD, so it went for the second.  Hey, Brian, was that ass better than the one you saw the last time you were in the studio? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, man, every time I come in here, it's a blast.  In fact, it was, like, a little weird when I came in today,  because last time we were in the studio, there was, like, a naked guy in a swimming pool.  That was on Ron and Ted.  Yeah.  I've seen the rat eaters here.  They had the hemorrhoid touch.  Hemorrhoid, yeah.  That was when we finally got these sounds.  I don't play it.  Eh, eh.  Ah, oh.  Those sounds, Brian was here watching the guy administer the Preparation H.  I'm a completely different person since I started coming in here.  You really are, man.  All right, Brooks, thank you. 
[01:02:00]  All right, thanks, Karen.  Later.  Well, Karen is the mother of a dwarf.  Oh, no.  Ah.  Well, let's give her some equal time here.  Karen?  Yes.  How are you?  Okay.  You know, there's an organization called Little People of America.  Oh.  Yeah.  And the politically correct term is little person.  Little person.  Oh, for a dwarf or a midget?  No, it's neither.  You know, it goes back in the days when you're referring to...  Hey, Karen, Karen, I've got to stop you.  We had kiss dwarfs last night.  They wanted to be called dwarfs, not midgets. 
[01:02:30]  Well, actually, they were called mini-kiss, weren't they?  Oh.  No, they called kiss dwarfs.  Yeah, they wanted to be called kiss dwarfs.  Mm-hmm.  So you're saying that neither term is correct.  No, what it is is actually, because being part of Little People of America, it was founded  by Billy Barty, who recently died.  He was a dwarf.  He had a different...  He had cartilage hair syndrome.  What's that?  Well, there's like 4,000 different kinds of dwarfism.  Well, I'm not going to memorize the name for any one of them. 
[01:03:00]  Well, neither am I.  Some of the people, you know, some of them, the most popular form is what you guys usually  see is achondroplagic.  You're a mother of a dwarf?  Child with dwarfism.  Dwarfism.  And I use it as a noun.  When did you find that out?  Oh.  When did I find that out?  You usually find it out either at birth or a few months after.  How was it with you?  A few months after?  Oh, the pregnancy must have been easy.  Well, sometimes they get diagnosed later, and, you know, there's doctors in university 
[01:03:30]  hospitals that specialize.  Yeah, I mean, your example, you gave birth, and then did you know right away, or did you...  Yeah, they find out during the pregnancy, even before the child was born.  Oh, how long during your pregnancy did you find out?  They could find out within, like, you know, six months when they're doing the sonograms.  Oh, and they did?  And all of a sudden they said, hey, you know, it's like this.  You're going to have a little person.  Or a child with dwarfism, and, you know, it's not as big as the deal as people make  it sound out.  There's people...  Did they give you the choice? 
[01:04:00]  Pardon me?  Did they ask you if you wanted to, you know, be given the choice?  You know, if that's not...  Well, you have those options.  It was any kind of, um, any mother has that choice, no matter what it is.  You know, the choice, the big A.  But you'd never do it.  No?  I'm sure somebody would.  You guys visited these people that did mini-kiss last night.  Some of them have families.  Oh, no, I know.  No, no, I'm saying they're great kids.  They have kids with, um...  We were loving kiss dwarfs last night.  They were great.  And, you know, dwarf, people with dwarfism, Opie, because I'm not going to use it as a 
[01:04:30]  noun.  Do you know, uh, they can have normal-sized children.  Yes, they can.  And that's got to be a trip, huh?  All of a sudden you're towering over mom and dad.  That happens all the time.  How old is your...  Is it a boy or a girl?  Girl.  And how old is she?  Six years old.  Yeah?  Okay.  Six?  Wow.  How about that?  All right, Karen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  That's it.  A little insight on, uh, on dwarfism. 
[01:05:00]  There you go, Opie.  All right.  I don't know.  Wouldn't you...  Probably, Brian, be staying away from this topic.  I don't know.  Wouldn't you just...  I don't know.  I think, eh, you know, if it doesn't have blonde hair and blue eyes, get rid of it.  All right.  I'm coming from you.  Thank you.  See, when it's extreme, it's funny.  Yeah, is my, uh, the thing growing inside me, is it going to have blonde hair? 
[01:05:30]  No?  All right.  I'm done with it.  I'm done.  Take it away.  Take it out.  I've had my fill.  Enough's enough.  All right.  Uh, Brian Regan in the studio playing Carolines all weekend long.  Call Carolines for tickets.  Uh, they're going to go fast.  Okay?  Yeah.  And, uh, someone told me to ask you about kids' books.  Oh, uh, well, you know, I've got a boy myself.  He's, uh, two years old and I've been reading to him, you know.  And is he a dwarf or a midget? 
[01:06:00]  He's a person with height.  With height.  Okay.  Not that that's any better than anybody else.  Tell me what he is.  Look at Brian.  He's squirming, man.  I used to stay right on that line, man.  Everyone loves me.  I want to continue that happy feeling.  Every time I say something, I've got to, like, go back.  What did I just say now, you know?  Both shows tonight, it's just going to be an hour of corrections and apologies.  When I first came in and talked about stalker Patty, first of all, that was unkind towards her. 
[01:06:30]  So I apologized about that.  Then I said midget, followed up with dwarves.  Both of them are politically incorrect.  I apologized again.  I got no time for any jokes.  Good night.  And I apologize that I can't do my jokes.  And I'm so sorry.  Now, I said, you know, I've been reading to, uh, to little Christopher and, uh, you know, these books.  I don't know who's writing children's books. 
[01:07:00]  I just want a piece of the pie, the financial pie to these big cardboard clunky books, you know?  And I have them on my lap, and it's like, the clock.  And you turn this big, chunky page, the big clock.  You turn another page, tick-tock.  You turn another page, the end.  When you look in the back, 12 bucks.  I mean, what?  Are these guys mingling with other authors?  Hey, I read your book, The Clock. 
[01:07:30]  That is a real page-turner.  You know, I was halfway into War and Peace, and then somebody told me about this The Clock book.  I had to pick that one up and give it a read.  Do you guys do books on tape?  My wife got me books on tape.  Every once in a while.  Because I can't read fast at all.  If you got one of those road trips, it makes the time go by.  Sure.  And I did it so I could, like, read faster, you know?  But, uh, or whatever.  Get through a book faster. 
[01:08:00]  But the whole point was so I could fit in better at parties, so I would have a little bit of knowledge, which I lack completely now.  But when you do books on tape, you still can't act cool at a party.  People talking about a book.  Yeah, that book.  I heard that book.  That book's a good lesson.  Because the reading thing is just throwing me for a loop, man.  They say reading makes you smarter.  If that's the case, then how come when you read a book, you have to put the title of the book on the top of every single page?  Does anybody ever get halfway through a book? 
[01:08:30]  What the hell am I reading?  It's right there at the top.  Okay.  I forget again.  Oh, it's right there.  Woo!  That is handy.  You know what?  You go to the movies.  I don't put the title of the movie on the top of the screen.  What are we watching?  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Wait.  Wait.  Who's that?  What?  Oh, there it is.  It's written clearly.  You know, you don't got to do that.  All you got to do is peek at your ticket stub.  You're not going to be looking at no screen.  You just take a gander down at your stub and you slip it back in your pocket. 
[01:09:00]  Nobody's the wiser.  That's how you find out what movie you're watching.  Well, reading's good, right?  You know?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  It's good.  It's hard to badmouth it.  You know?  Nobody can...  You never see, like, a Crossfire episode about the benefits of reading.  You know?  And in the pro side of reading is like a professor with a bow tie.  And in the opposite side, hey, let me tell you something.  Reading, reading ain't never.  Reading ain't not never, Doug. 
[01:09:30]  What?  Reading ain't not, not never.  Um, you know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  Brian Regan.  Yes.  Well, let me take a break.  Goddamn.  Very good, Brian.  Tonight at a Caroline.  Yes.  Join us tonight.  Oh, want to go to the FU line?  Okay.  Uh, don't forget Triple H from the WWF coming in in about a half hour or so.  Are you a wrestling fan, Brian?  And, uh, ah, you know, look at this, you can't take this guy. 
[01:10:00]  It's got its merits.  I can, I can translate, um, Brian speak if you would like.  WWF is a complete waste of time and my kid will never, ever, ever, ever watch it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no.  It's got a good entertainment value to it.  There you go.  You know, people get a lot of joy out of wrestling.  It's just nuts, you snappy dressers.  You know.  Of course, they did horrible things, but the organization. 
[01:10:30]  They were organized.  And fine, snappy dressers.  Yes, they were.  All right, we'll be back with Brian Reagan.  Let's go to the FU line and see what's going on today.  This is the Opie and Anthony FU Friday line.  Yeah, I'd like to get a big f*** you to my job.  You guys run me into the ground 14 hours a goddamn day, six days a week,  while all your little pet employees go home after eight hours.  Well, to your pet employees and to you, go f*** yourself. 
[01:11:00]  Next message.  Hi, this is Lauren from New Jersey.  I want to give a big FU to the New Jersey legislators for changing the state lottery law from 18 to 21.  And I want to give a FU to the Godhead that works late nights at 7-11 in Eaton Town for being such a dick about it.  I hope a sparking machine falls on his dirty heading cell zone.  Thanks.  Next message.  I'd like to leave a nice big f*** you to parents who blame TV and video games for kids running around with guns and shooting people.  Okay?  F*** you, people. 
[01:11:30]  End of message.  Anthony?  God, he's telling a good story and I had to interrupt him.  I know.  That sucks.  All right, we'll get back to that in a second.  Anthony Rothman.  Yes, guys hate to shop for clothes.  Isn't it a pain in the ass?  You do that yourself?  You go out and blow the whole commercial.  I actually love it.  No, you hate it.  Oh, that's right.  I don't like it.  That's right.  I don't like it.  All men.  Shopping has its merits.  Guys just hate it.  I know I hate going to a department store and trying to find something to wear. 
[01:12:00]  Remember when we had our TV show for about ten minutes opening?  We had to go and...  We had to look good.  We had to...  We could have used Rothman's.  Get clothing.  We didn't know the fine folks at Rothman's at that point.  Well, what do they do?  They have clothes.  Men's clothes.  For dwarfs.  One-stop.  Little people.  There's nothing for a little...  Well, you know, they probably tailor it.  Custom tailor it.  It's one-stop shopping for your men's clothing needs.  Without having to go to department stores and deal with all the people and the... 
[01:12:30]  You know, women in department stores.  They're getting in the way.  It's a men's store.  They have reasonable prices.  Reasonable attitudes, too.  And they have experts that can help you sort the whole corporate casual thing.  You know that whole corporate casual thing that's taken over now?  I have to wear those sometimes.  Don't even know what it means, really.  I don't even know what the hell corporate casual is.  Is it corporate or is it a casual?  The mixture of the two?  It's anything that's not a suit.  Is it? 
[01:13:00]  I think it can be a suit.  But it can be a suit.  Without a tie.  You know, like a T-shirt underneath.  Oh.  Don Johnson.  There you go.  So if you're looking for a suit, shoes, clothing to go out in, they have great selections.  From Hugo Boss, Kenneth Cole, Hickey Freeman, Calvin Klein, and more that I can't pronounce.  Rothmans has their big star in Union Square at the corner of 17th Street and Park.  And another one in the center of Scarsdale.  Give them a call, 212-777-7400.  212-777-7400. 
[01:13:30]  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  As come.  Opie Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Brian Riggins in the studio playing Caroline.  It's all weekend long.  We're all going down.  Tickets going fast.  You might want to call Caroline and reserve your seat now.  Right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Triple H coming into the studio in about a half hour.  Sorry.  And Matt wants to say hi to Brian. 
[01:14:00]  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, Brian.  You're awesome.  Thank you, Matt.  Yeah, I have kind of two questions for you.  The first one is, I haven't been able to find your first TV yet.  Is it in, like, Tower Records?  I don't know if it's there.  If you went to, like, Amazon.com, it would be there.  Okay.  Or, uh, Napster.  Well, that's true.  My second question is, do you run a website somewhere?  Yeah, you can just get it for free if you want. 
[01:14:30]  You know, you can get it on Amazon.com, or if you don't want to pay any money, you can always download it on Napster.  For free, it's always better.  Well, let's do it to our city, eh?  Actually, you know, we don't even care.  I don't care.  It gets our name out there, you know?  Well, when people told me that, I was, like, so flattered, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, the Metallica thing, I can understand their gripe, you know?  They have a point.  But when I heard that I was on there, I was like, man, that's fantastic.  Hey, do you run your own website anywhere, like stupidpeople.com or something? 
[01:15:00]  Not yet.  So you may have one, too.  I have the domain name.  That's the only step I can do.  You own BrianReagan.com.  Yeah, I spent the $75 or whatever it is to get the name, and that's about all I know how to do.  It took me, like, eight months to figure that out.  I'm going to go get your stuff from Napster, then.  I'll book you later.  I don't think you heard the first part.  Amazon.com.  Amazon.com.  That's if you want to pay.  Matt, seriously, Tower Records usually has it in the comedy section. 
[01:15:30]  I've seen it there many times.  And Borders.  Borders.  And Borders?  Okay.  Borders, I never thought to look there.  It's a great CD.  We play clips from it all the time.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I'm trying to get, but I never seem to see there.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye, Matt.  Here's one of my takes on Napster that I heard.  It's an upgrade.  If you bought vinyl many years ago, and all of a sudden they changed the form out of the 
[01:16:00]  music, and it is now, it's not modern, the record player.  So they put out new equipment, CD players.  Why should I have to then pay again for the same music that I already bought on vinyl?  So I am just getting the upgrade off of Napster for the music I already had.  These are, like, albums that you've had since the 70s?  That's how I justify it.  He doesn't want to buy, you know, the Yes album. 
[01:16:30]  I'm also all for food borrowing.  You just walk into someone's house, you open their fridge and start eating, and you go,  no, we're just sharing.  I'm file sharing in your refrigerator.  Food sharing.  Oh, man.  So, Brian was telling us a little story about the emergency room.  Yeah.  He was cracking us up.  I had to go myself.  I had, like, a stomach virus thing, and it was 2 o'clock in the morning.  My wife was watching Christopher, so she couldn't take me.  I almost called an ambulance.  And it's weird, like, well, it's weird considering calling an ambulance for yourself. 
[01:17:00]  You know, you always figure you call an ambulance for somebody else.  What do you say about yourself?  Can you come get me?  Yeah, I don't feel so hot.  Could you do the code blue where you don't stop for nobody?  And just come on in.  I'll be sitting on the couch rubbing my belly.  I was just looking at the phone.  I don't think you're allowed to call an ambulance for yourself.  So I drove myself to the emergency room, which has to be a worse option.  It's 2 o'clock in the morning.  I show up at the entrance, and they don't have any valet parking at the emergency room. 
[01:17:30]  If there's ever a place where they should have a valet parking stand, you know,  if there's ever a time we're going to go, can you park this because I need to collapse immediately.  But, no, I've got to deal with, please take the ticket.  You know, and I'm driving around this lot.  Hey, can I park there?  I think I'm going to die.  I'm dying, too.  Okay, go ahead.  I'll go up a couple levels.  It doesn't matter if you're driving yourself or somebody else. 
[01:18:00]  If you're driving somebody, you still want to hop out with them at the door.  You're supposed to drop somebody off while you go park.  Okay, you go in.  Tell them you're shot.  Ask them if they validate.  You take care of the bullet wounds, and I'll handle parking.  We'll work it out 50-50.  And then, you know, I go in there at 2 o'clock in the morning. 
[01:18:30]  I would think that that would be all they need to know to start doing stuff.  The fact that you show up at a hospital at 2 a.m.?  Right.  Must mean, hey, he's here.  Start sticking tubes up his nose.  What else are you showing up for?  Man, I'm bored.  I saw your lights on, and I was wondering, who's up for canasta?  I got a hankering for some canasta like you wouldn't believe.  But I got to, you know, check in with it. 
[01:19:00]  The question they ask, it kills me.  They throw, they say, what seems to be the problem?  The seems part is so insulting.  What seems to be the problem?  Well, it seems.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  That's what it seems like.  But, you know, I'm no doctor until it gets analyzed officially by one of your medical staff. 
[01:19:30]  In my own delusional world, it seems like there ain't no moisture left inside me.  They put you in a bag in this room, you know.  It's like they do a half room kind of thing with a curtain down the middle with a mystery patient on the other side.  You know, you just see the silhouette over there.  What the hell's the matter with that person?  And I'm laying there, and that person over there is moaning, you know. 
[01:20:00]  I'm like, man, they're never going to help me with him moaning like that.  So I got to outmoan him, you know.  He's like, I'm like, ah!  He's cranking it up.  Quit moaning.  We're all hurting.  It's the emergency room.  They know this.  You know, the nurse, as much as you run around holding their ears,  it's got to be hell to work in this environment. 
[01:20:30]  Then they come in, and the nurse is like, she asks, how are you feeling?  And I said, you know, terrible, you know.  Do you have like a painkiller?  She goes, how would you describe your pain?  What kind of question?  Um, otherworldly?  I don't know.  It's hard for me to find adjectives that can cover this pain.  She goes, well, how would you rate it then? 
[01:21:00]  How would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain?  Well, you're not saying 2 ain't going to get you nothing.  Right.  Oh, I'm a 2.  Um, maybe the high 1s.  If you could get me a baby aspirin and cut it in half,  and maybe a Flintstone vitamin, and I'll be out of your hair.  I don't mean to bother y'all with my low-level,  flying-beneath-the-radar-screen pain level.  Uh, I'm 10, I guess, you know.  I was going to say 10, but I backed off, 
[01:21:30]  because I had heard the worst pain a human can endure.  I don't know if this is true,  but I heard it was getting your upper leg bone,  your femur bone, cracked in half.  Oh.  So I thought I'd better not say 10,  because I didn't get my femur bone cracked.  Then I was thinking, what was I worried about?  Is it like a femur ward at the hospital?  They'll hear about it and come hobbling into my room.  Who the hell had the audacity to say they were out of level 10?  You know nothing about 10.  Give me a sled, Jeremy.  Let me show you what 10 is all about, Mr. Tummyache. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, but I'm fine now.  If I ended up, I had the sniffles.  Ah, the sniffles.  The sniffles.  What the hell is that?  That's all that.  You know what?  You get what we call the sniffles.  The sniffles.  You must feel like a moron at that point.  Hey, Anthony.  What?  How do we know he's Brian Regan? 
[01:22:30]  Hmm?  I was just thinking over here.  Someone is on the line saying they're Brian Regan.  There you go.  Brian Regan.  What is happening here?  You sure you're Brian Regan?  I always thought I was.  I always thought I was.  I always thought I was.  Pop down Brian Regan.  Uh, Brian Regan?  Hello?  Yeah.  You've got a phony in the studio.  Screwed up a word.  Couldn't get it up correctly.  Trying to do the word, but it wasn't working.  That is me.  Brian's doing a little... 
[01:23:00]  Brian, the real Brian Regan was just in Vegas.  Doing a little gambling.  Putting the money in some machines and getting coins to come out.  The coins coming out.  Just landing in my pockets.  Trade them in to get some dollars.  I didn't realize how simple my material was.  I was thirsty and bought some water and then drank it.  It was good.  That's funny. 
[01:23:30]  We're going to throw that in tonight, man.  Wait a second.  The real Brian Regan would have done a joke instead of just saying stupid things like I did.  The real Brian Regan would have had a bit.  I just talked and repeated what I said until I make people angry.  The real Brian Regan would have said something funny.  I don't have that kind of material.  I don't know about that, man.  Hey, this is Frank Caliendo.  How are you doing, Frank?  I'm doing all my life.  I'm going to keep being used. 
[01:24:00]  I blew it.  I blew the whole illusion.  How are you doing, me?  You tore it down the wall.  How am I?  Yeah.  It's like you're in a play and you talk to the audience.  Hey, what do you think?  We're doing pretty good, huh?  I've got to get back to talking to King Lear.  You just broke in the fourth wall.  All right, Frank.  All right, Rick just gave me a call.  It's over to call it and mess with Brian.  No, no.  Very good job, man.  I think you nailed it.  If I can't make a gig, I'm going to call you. 
[01:24:30]  That's where you're going, man.  I'll be the short, fat, flying weekend.  Oh, man.  That's very flattering.  Hey, Frank, can I put you on the spot?  Sure.  You've got to do just a tiny bit of Al Pacino for Brian.  Mr. Regan, my name's Al.  How are you doing?  I'm doing good.  Listen, I was wondering how I could get into doing some comedy.  I mean, the other day, I was thinking about back to my childhood.  You might have recalled this time. 
[01:25:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, Al.  We're losing him.  We lost.  I'm really into it.  It's tough when you're driving.  You know what I'm saying?  I've been listening.  Yeah, we got you now, man.  Yeah, there you go.  You got a cup of dirt.  That's what I was trying to get to you.  Guess what, Frank?  It didn't work out.  That would blow my mind to see Al Pacino doing my cup of dirt.  A cup of dirt.  Hey, KJ, it's a cup of dirt.  A cup of dirt.  A cup of dirt. 
[01:25:30]  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Sorry, it wasn't that funny.  No, it was good.  Your phone was crapping out on us.  Oh, it wasn't?  Yeah.  Let's blame it on that.  And I look forward to hearing your John Madden one day, too, man.  I hear that song.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Hey, someday that guy, see you in that, and there you go.  Sometimes you got a cell phone, and it works real good, and that means there's a tower 
[01:26:00]  nearby, and if you got a tower nearby, that's a good thing.  And when there's no tower nearby, then it's a bad thing.  And good things, as we know, are better than bad things.  Bad things aren't as good as good things.  Sometimes there's a good thing that can be a bad thing for somebody else, and that's not  the best kind of thing for that person.  But at least it's good for you.  And when it's good for you and it's not good for them, there's good and bad.  And there's a garden of Eden, and, you know, that's the Bible. 
[01:26:30]  You probably read about that there.  And he ate what's gave the forbidden fruit there.  Bravo, Frank.  Hey, Frank, thank you.  All right, I'll leave you guys alone.  Yeah, come see us soon, all right?  All right, we'll talk to you later.  Thank you, Frank.  Frank Caliendo.  Man.  You're making great, Madden.  Hey, we've got to back up a couple jokes.  Jessica's a little bummed.  She thinks the femur, broken bone thing should be more than a 10. 
[01:27:00]  10's the mostest.  She's looking too into your bed.  Jessica.  This pain goes to 11.  Hey.  Hi, Jessica.  Femur, you said you'd rate it a 10.  No, much more than that, my friend.  More than a 10.  Much, much more than a 10.  This is like that Spinal Tap episode.  Yeah.  10 is the most.  Well, why don't you just make it a little?  No, it's above the most.  You broke your femur, obviously.  Yeah, I split it in half and popped it out of my leg.  Nice.  No.  Okay, so that pain is 11.  11, 11, 11, across the board.  Yeah, I slipped the car. 
[01:27:30]  I'm damn proud of myself.  All right, Jessica.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye-bye.  That's a big bonus snap.  Yeah, that's the biggest one.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Hey, Lexi.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, my God.  Brian, you are killing me.  Listen, we're coming.  I got about nine people coming to your show later.  All right.  Thank you, Lexi.  And we're going to see you about 10.30.  But before we go, you know, it's daylight and kids are having birthday parties on my street.  And, you know, they sort of wanted some ideas for party games. 
[01:28:00]  And we didn't know what to tell them.  You know, I don't know.  I would think maybe some pin the tail on the donkey.  I think that's a great idea for kids.  Why?  Does this make it kind of dangerous, though?  Well, no.  I think, I don't know what people were thinking when they came up with pin the tail on the donkey.  All right.  We're going to have a whole bunch of kids over.  We're going to blindfold one, give them something sharp, spin them around, and let them go.  Go, Bobby, with a pin.  Just run them down.  What are those noises? 
[01:28:30]  Those are puncture wounds, Bobby.  Stop.  We made a horrible error.  Or you could try musical chairs.  There's a nice little anxiety attack for seven-year-olds.  Only one kid can win.  All the other kids are walking around.  Oh, oh, oh, ah!  There's elbowing other five-year-olds.  How was the party?  It was horrible.  I couldn't get a chair, and I got a pin in my neck.  I don't want to go back to that house. 
[01:29:00]  I got a pin in my jugular.  You said that would be a happy house.  You said!  So those are two options.  That was a good setup by Lexi.  Yeah, very good.  Yeah, the softball lob.  The quality setup there, man.  Lexi, we'll see you at the Caroline side.  Oh, my God.  All right?  All right, we're going to just let her go.  Usually people set stuff up by saying the absolute last part of the joke, you know? 
[01:29:30]  Do the thing where you say jugular vein at the end.  Erected.  That's a surprise.  Do that.  The big yellow ones decide.  At least tonight when you possibly do that, you won't be shocked when everyone starts  screaming and applauding like the first time.  That was so flattering.  Why the hell are they applauding that much?  I didn't realize at the time that you guys just pumped that up, man.  I certainly appreciate the support, but I was like thrown for a loop. 
[01:30:00]  You know, usually you do it and hopefully you get a little bit of a laugh.  I did it that night.  And it was people were like yelling, don't they yell at the sun?  I'm like, what the hell is going on here, man?  The call phrase of the retarded.  It really is.  Joke hit this nerd before in front of a crowd.  Yeah, that was strange, but people are applauding and clapping.  They had their lighters out like you started a free bird.  Hey, I got a setup for you.  Yeah?  Brian, I recently learned, heard. 
[01:30:30]  I heard that you're eating it.  I recently learned, heard.  I recently heard that you learned to play chess.  Nice setup.  So, thank you.  I actually got a talent for that.  I had a radio guy.  I may have told you this before.  I went in there and I had written down some topics.  I said, you can get into them if you want.  If not, that's fine.  He goes, Brian, you wrote down here for me to ask you about dogs. 
[01:31:00]  Why, do you have some good dog jokes?  Oh, do I?  Do I ever?  I'm known for my funny dog jokes.  Funny dog joke number one.  Now, just sit back and be entertained by my dog jokes.  Sit back and destroy my dog jokes.  But, you know, it's funny you mention this thing about chess, Opie, because...  I just had a hunch, you know.  I have been playing chess.  You know, the thing that's weird about it, it doesn't end, it doesn't end right. 
[01:31:30]  It doesn't end.  Like, there's no finality to it.  You know, you're just looking at the board and your opponent goes, checkmate.  And you're like, my king is still there.  And he's like, yeah, but no matter what you do in the next move, I take the king and the following move.  So, it's a checkmate.  You know, he's in the car heading home.  No other game lets you do that.  You know, you never see a quarterback come up to the line, touchdown!  The way your safeties are playing, we'll do a slam pass underneath the coverage.  Too much of a cushion.  Six points.  Touchdown. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, why don't you score the touchdown, man?  And then you get warned, which is...  You don't see that in anything else either.  In chess, before you ever get checkmated.  You know, your opponent just goes, check, check.  I'm sorry, what?  What does this mean?  You're in check.  You're in trouble.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  I wasn't aware, but now I am.  You don't see that in football.  You don't see the linebackers, you know, just talking to the quarterback.  Hey, we're blitzing.  What? 
[01:32:30]  He's doing a safety blitz from back in there.  I'm sneaking in right here between the center and the guard.  Oh, okay.  Hey, block him.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Linebacker.  I have no idea.  One of the only jokes where I whisper.  I go from screaming jugular to whispering linebacker.  You're going to pity my jugular. 
[01:33:00]  Thank you, Mr. Linebacker.  Would you just pick on it on a volume level, Ho-Ho?  Because I'm back here scrambling.  You're all over the place.  Now people are requesting this.  And we've got a guy locked in a shed.  Uh-oh.  What?  Let's see what's going on with Foot.  Foot, what's up?  Yeah.  You're locked in a shed?  Yeah, it's Foot from Mr. Listen.  This is, uh, Foot.  It's windy here. 
[01:33:30]  The wind blew the door shut.  The light is on the outside.  I'm stuck in the goddamn shed.  Jeez.  You're not stuck.  No, I'm not.  Here, listen.  I'll bang on the door.  Help!  Listen.  No, listen.  If Ricky's out there, Ricky, come get me out of the shed in the backyard.  The goddamn wind blew the door shut.  I'm standing here burping the bishop.  It's dark.  It's cold.  I'm in a T-shirt.  It ain't funny.  I guess it's funny, but if you were me, it wouldn't be funny.  What's in the shed?  What's in the shed? 
[01:34:00]  You've got two lawn tractors, a pan head, some rakes, and some other sharp stuff that  I just banged my head on.  I throw some rakes and tools on the floor so we can hear it.  Throw some rakes and tools on the floor?  Yeah, just so I can hear.  Because you're yelling.  Let me move around.  You're yelling help isn't proof enough.  Right.  You're stuck.  What was that?  That's a tobacco, a garden hoe.  Start a hoe.  I'm slapping a hoe around.  Start up.  Well, that's the F word, my friend. 
[01:34:30]  So you will not start up the lawn mower.  How about you just, like, you know, kind of start up?  How about you guys get me out of here?  You know, if I was ever stuck in a shed, I'd be a little nicer.  I don't think the first thing I would have thought of was to call a radio show.  Yeah, I'm going to call Opie and Anthony.  You don't think that's a smart idea?  No, of course.  I tried calling three of my friends.  They ain't home yet.  They ain't got cell phones.  They're listening to you.  There's Ricky.  Ricky and Gary. 
[01:35:00]  Kick the door.  Come on, man.  There's sharks.  There's beers in the house.  I just bought a 12-pack.  Kick the door open.  No, I ain't kicking the door open.  I just paid two grand for this shed.  Are there windows?  No, there's no windows.  There's little vents that you can't get out of.  Forget it.  Why does it work that you can lock yourself in this shed?  It's a shed, man.  The latch is on the outside.  It's windy as hell here.  Didn't you ever have a shed?  Not one that had that kind of a trick coyote from the Roadrunner lock on it. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, it's a trick.  That's a condescending kind of question.  Like, didn't you ever go to school?  Didn't you ever have a shed?  Have a shed.  Oh, yeah, of course I had a shed.  Well, then you know the latch is on the outside and the latch is on the inside.  Anthony, you don't know that.  I had a shed.  I grew up with a shed, man.  Yeah, but there's no latch on the inside.  And there's no safety mechanism that would keep you from being locked in.  Listen, play one of those Ashley Cade things.  I might as well burp the bishop while I'm waiting here. 
[01:36:00]  All right, we're going to keep you on hold.  Make sure you get out of the shed alive, okay?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, hold on.  I'm holding.  There's footy stuck in a shed somewhere.  All right, we've got to take a break, Anthony.  Brian Regan playing Caroline tonight.  Yes.  And all weekend long.  We're all going.  Get your tickets now, okay?  I'm distracted.  I think Triple H is entering the studio.  Oh, is he?  Well, beer is entering the studio.  I see lots and lots of beer.  Okay.  All right, we'll be back.  You want to go to the FU line?  Let's do that. 
[01:36:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony FU Friday line.  Hi, this is Kelly, and I just wanted to say to all the people at Long Beach Street Double Park,  F*** you.  What the hell do you think?  That's not a f***ing parking spot, you dumb motherf***ers.  It's an actual lane.  We're trying to drive and you're parked and you're f***ing deeper.  Well, f*** you and go to hell.  Thank you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave an FU to your friggin' intern, Brian, who ran into me while I was 
[01:37:00]  on my motorcycle.  Friggin' moron idiot.  Well, granted, we were only going 20, but his head went through the friggin' windshield  that had a nice head deep and eye patch, baby.  Next message.  Hey, Fred.  FU.  You owe money.  You don't pay it.  I don't understand how you can do that.  Fred can't.  FU.  You know who this is.  End of message.  Don't be real.  It doesn't care about our lives.  And I hate you all. 
[01:37:30]  Oh.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  Ah!  You've got to hurt me.  Look, Kirkie, I don't need to talk to you.  All right, kids.  Hold on your hat.  One, two, three.  Ah!  No blows, monkey boy.  No blows, monkey boy.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!

[01:38:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Come on, it's not funny anymore.  You can stop.  You can stop.  Let's check in with foot real fast.  Foot, you still in the shed?  Yeah, I'm still in the shed. 
[01:39:00]  Listen, what are you hearing?  Probably people are trying to call me, and it sucks.  Well, who do you want to call or whatever, have call you?  Ricky.  Ricky, okay.  Or Gary.  Or Gary.  All right, you're locked in the shed.  I'm starting to think it was a prank, but who knows.  All right, Anthony, Optimum Online from Cable Vision.  Yes, so.  Talking about cable modems.  Do we dare ask Brian Regan if he has a cable modem? 
[01:39:30]  What kind of connection you got to the Internet, Brian?  2X2000.  2X2000.  All right, what's that, Brian?  It's 40 megahertz.  200 CBs of RAM, and, you know, I'm maxed out.  You know, you've got to sound like you know what you're talking about.  That's pretty good.  You know, he's babbling, but it sounds confident.  What do you think?  How many times have you heard that, though?  8-track capability.  There you go.  Get the best. 
[01:40:00]  Nice.  Actually, you know, my friend, I was working on my friend's computer, and his computer, like,  anticipates things, you know, like, I'm working, I write M-O-N, and I go, this thing pops up Monday?  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, Monday.  F-E-B, February?  Yeah.  And then it says, it looks like you're writing a letter.  Do you need help?  I'm like, what the hell?  And I go to mine, you know, mine tries.  I write M-O-N, monkey?  No, Monday, man.  F-E-B, Febreze, fabric softener? 
[01:40:30]  No, no, February.  It looks like you're trying to write the Magna Carta.  Do you need help?  I'm okay.  I got it.  I got it.  Thanks for trying.  I like how he pulled in the funny document that is the Magna Carta.  What?  Nice reference.  Of course.  I could get a better one today.  You said you were playing chess online.  Yes, I was.  And now you do this over your 56K modem, don't you? 
[01:41:00]  56 OC, I guess 2,000 kiloburts.  Kiloburts, I got 250 kiloburts.  I got 8,000 mega rams.  Right.  That thing is loaded, man.  Flying.  Yeah.  Cool.

[01:42:00]  Man, we got a lot going on today.  Brian Regan in the studio playing Caroline tonight.  And all weekend long.  We got to get him out of here soon, unfortunately.  We're just riding his coattails today.  Ah, yeah.  Can I join the, uh, the ass contest?  You like the best ass contest?  You want to be a contestant?  You just want Rick to, uh, photograph your ass.  Yeah, that looked kind of interesting.  You manhandled like that. 
[01:42:30]  Who was that last contestant, Rick?  A lot of girls getting, uh, their, their pictures taken today.  Yeah, that was Debra.  She came back.  She was from here last Friday, but she needed a reshoot.  Wait, that was just Debra?  Yeah.  And she's a reshoot?  She's a reshoot from last Friday.  All right, let me look.  Okay.  That's...  Yeah, you know something?  Good thing.  Yeah.  Like this shot.  That one there just ain't right.  That looks like she's, uh, on the bowl.  That's a taking a dump shot.  She wasn't happy with shot number two, so I figured I would be. 
[01:43:00]  I rattled off another 20 shots.  It's a coincidence that shot number two.  Because it looks like that's what she's doing, right?  The couch is nice.  And then the, the, the third picture's nice.  Yeah.  That one...  Yeah, that doesn't do her any good.  One of these things is not like the other.  Everybody's got a different taste.  I'm putting up there a little something for everybody.  It's great.  I see.  This is the last day to qualify, and man...  Yeah, I just, I just...  I'm just telling you out there.  The reshoot of Allison is now up on the site. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  WNW.com.  The ones you just did, they're already on.  No, no, no.  This was from about 20 minutes ago.  Wait till you see the ones, uh, Rick just talked.  All right.  Thank you, clinical horny goat weed, for sponsoring the Best Ass Contest.  Oh, new girl.  Gotta go.  Oh, really?  Seriously?  He's got him running out of his camera.  He's at home.  You're up, pretty girl.  I gotta go.  Yeah, yeah.  You would think he was doing some bird watching or something, and that rare bird just flew  by the window.  Joe, what's up? 
[01:44:00]  Hey, uh, Brian, my computer's down.  I can't put the NASA.  If I run some tape now, you think maybe you could do your TV for me?  Yeah, man.  I'll do it from the intro.  Please welcome to the stage.  And listen, guys, how does a Polish guy end an Opie and Anthony call?  How?  Take it easy, guys.  I suck.  He's a comedy genius, that guy.  We're going to be laughing at that in years to come. 
[01:44:30]  He's just ahead of time.  In case I end up working with that guy.  Dave, Brian, always do.  The kind Brian.  Two minutes from now, he's going to be working with me, going, you badmouthed me when I did  that little Polish joke.  Oh, you were the guy on the phone.  You're a genius.  Chad, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm a pretty new listener, and I've never heard Brian do, the big yellow one's the  sun.  Oh, he'll do that.  Big yellow one.  It's kind of an involved thing, but the gist of it is, you know, is that. 
[01:45:00]  The big yellow one is indeed the sun.  I'm talking about boiling it down to, and that right there is the punchline.  So I hope you enjoyed it.  Go to Caroline's this weekend.  That's his free bird.  Yeah, it's a fun bit to do.  I don't always do it.  Sometimes I do it.  Are you going to do the fishing one?  Fishing on TV?  I'll try to do that.  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to do.  Well, it's like, you know, because I'm always watching the TV thing.  In fact, I was at a club, and a guy gave me a fishing tape on stage, you know. 
[01:45:30]  I was in the middle of another joke.  This guy with flannel on down in the south just walks toward the stage.  I'm thinking, is this guy going to hit me with a shovel or what, you know?  And the guy just hands me a fishing tape and goes, do that joke.  Do that joke.  I'm in the middle of another joke.  Yes, sir.  I'll do this joke right now, you know.  Don't want to get anyone mad.  Man, I want to hear that joke right now.  You jibbering and jabbering about all this other nonsense. 
[01:46:00]  I came in with my fishing tape.  Now, dude, a fishing tape joke.  Which is, you know, I mean, I watch fishing on TV sometimes, you know.  You're bored, you click around.  But what gets you is when you're watching for like 15 minutes, and you go, man, I better get a life.  I'm watching fishing.  I'm not even fishing.  I'm watching fishing.  I'm too lazy to fish.  I'm taping fishing to watch again later. 
[01:46:30]  You're calling your friends up.  Come on over.  I got a fishing tape.  No one, no one.  You saw salmon.  This is trout.  Get on over here.  And at the end, they roll credits.  That's what just blows me away.  They have credits for the fishing show, you know.  What are all these guys doing?  I want to credit this film editor.  This poor guy.  He's got to watch all the footage that's not exciting enough to make it in that final show.  He's got to sit there just looking.  No, no, no, no. 
[01:47:00]  No.  Huff.  No, no, no.  No, that was when he put the worm on the hook.  That was, that's not good enough.  And one of the credits, I swear, is writer.  What the hell?  What's he writing?  Oh, she's a beauty.  Tapping that out on a script.  The guy's got to memorize his lines.  He catches a fish.  You have a line.  Oh, it's a fish.  It's a beauty fish.  It's a fish.  It's a fish and a beauty.  Fish and a beauty fish. 
[01:47:30]  Okay, cut.  You want to, you want to work on your line?  You need some time in your trailer to work on your line?  And she just has it taped to the inside of the boat, man.  Do that.  Do that, Joe.  Do that right now.  God damn, you guys got me laughing. 
[01:48:00]  We love when you come by.  Hey, Lisa, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  I was calling with regard to the caller who's locked in his shed.  Yeah.  That guy said that he had some babes in the house with a 12-pack.  Yeah.  Why doesn't he just call inside his own house?  The girls will answer the phone and they'll let him out of the shed.  Yeah, foot.  What?  You still in the shed?  Yeah, right.  You think I'm on hold because I want to burn a Friday night on hold?  Well, you're burning it in the shed.  Why aren't you calling your house?  There's nobody in the house.  I live alone. 
[01:48:30]  It's a six-pack and a bag of weed.  What, am I going to call them?  This guy's sitting in his shed locked in there.  I ain't sitting.  I'm standing.  And it's cold.  Sorry, I didn't realize the body position.  He's standing in his shed.  And he's on hold.  And I'm here doing a fishing tape joke.  He's going, if this clown would stop talking, they could get some help.  There you go.  Are you listening to the show?  Yeah, well, I'm being entertained.  Could you make it a little funnier?  Do you have a radio in there? 
[01:49:00]  No, I got a phone.  I got nothing in there.  I got no lights or nothing.  It's kind of dark.  You know, we could take your entertainment away right now.  Yeah, we just hang up on you.  Then you'll have nobody.  No light signs.  You'll be gone.  I'm thinking about calling the cops, but I don't know.  They don't like me.  A lot of people want to know your address so they can rob your house while you're in your shed.  They'll part you from the other side of the latch.  Yeah, that would be fun, right?  You're just going, hey, foot, what's up?  I'm taking your TV. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, listen, it could be being robbed right now.  The front door's unlocked.  And what town do you live in?  Island.  Island?  Yeah.  Where's that?  No, it's in Central Jersey.  Central Jersey?  Yeah, it's down for a start, Ed.  What street?  Because I kind of have an aunt that lives in that area.  No, we ain't getting that, no.  There's a lot of losers around here.  They'll walk right in, no.  Yeah, coming from a guy locked in his shed.  A lot of losers out there.  Nice.  My aunt lives on Washington Street, there. 
[01:50:00]  There ain't no Washington Street in this one.  All right, foot.  What do you mean, all right?  You leaving me here?  Yeah.  We'll put you on hold again.  I don't know.  Oh, that ain't right.  That ain't right.  What do you want us to do?  Tell Timmy Dodd to get over here.  I don't know.  Nobody's home from work yet.  I'm the only a-hole home from work early.  If you start up your lawnmower, we'll get a cop over there.  No, I hate, no.  I don't want no cops, and I don't want to start the lawnmower.  If things smoke, I'll gas myself.  What is this, Auschwitz here? 
[01:50:30]  Forget it.  Well, it's hysterical.  He calls you for help, and you go, all right, foot.  You know, like you got to go.  Imagine if they call the fire department, and they have that attitude.  I'm stuck in a shed.  I can't get out.  All right, man.  Thanks for calling.  We got it written down here.  It ain't going to happen.  All right.  Hold on, okay?  No, I don't want to hold.  Yeah, I'll hold.  Hold on for a little while.  Yeah, what do you want us to do?  We've tried everything.  What did you try?  We've tried nothing.  Tried nothing.  Every option is conceivable to man. 
[01:51:00]  Consider we're trying to do a radio show at the same time.  Yeah, we did a lot.  All right.  So we'll put you on hold.  Thank you.  It's not exactly like talking down a passenger flying a 747 because the pilot dropped dead,  you know?  It's locked in a shed.  You know, it's not quite as exciting and thrilling to talk them through this situation.  Keep your nose up.  You took offense to the sitting in the shed.  I don't know what that is, eh?  Struck a nerve there. 
[01:51:30]  Standing, Brian.  Standing.  Standing in the shed.  All right, man.  Standing, Brian.  I wouldn't be kidding.  Vito.  Hey, Brian.  Yes, Vito.  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Hey, listen.  I got a little problem.  I got to go to the eye doctor.  Oh, that's right.  And I hate when you guys take those eye chart exams.  I was wondering if you had any tips for me.  That's a great tip.  I don't have any tips for me.  Look at the setup you guys have today.  I don't have a setup, man.  Like underhand, kids lobbing it in.  It's like home run derby. 
[01:52:00]  Just throwing them over the place.  No, I don't.  Next call.  No, I don't see a professional.  No, you know, it's like they do that one test where they put the big thing on your face.  That's what kills me.  That big, you know, you sit in that big chair.  They put that big thing on your face and they start clicking buttons.  You like it better like this or like this?  You like this one or this one?  It's too much pressure, you know?  And I'm always afraid, you know, that the doctor is just going to like go, all right, pal, get out of the chair. 
[01:52:30]  I'm like, I can't make up my mind.  I can't commit.  The doctor asked me if I wanted to try trifocals.  Have you done trifocals?  I was like, I must have been away a while.  He goes, well, it's what you think.  You know, you can see at three different distances depending on where you look through the lens.  You can see close or medium or far away.  And I'm like, I can't even imagine getting used to that, you know?  There's a book.  There's a plane.  There's Alpha Centauri. 
[01:53:00]  Do people need this kind of rain?  Is that a fly on my nose?  Is that a comet?  Hey, do you need to see everything?  You got like one little area is like a microscope and the other thing is like one of those big, you know, telescopes they put on top of a mountain.  I think I see this amoeba.  Whoa!  Look at those asteroids hitting Saturn! 
[01:53:30]  Why don't you just get something where you can read?  Oh, man.  Stick like that one.  Oh, yeah.  That's some good stuff right there.  I think we have to get you out of here.  You want to leave us with a little soap?  Going to Caroline.  Doing the Caroline.  Yeah.  Tonight and tomorrow.  Doing Sunday or?  Well, they have another thing going Sunday, so I'm doing three shows Saturday. 
[01:54:00]  Three shows Saturday?  Two Friday, three Saturday.  Leave drivers over there.  Caroline's right.  They'll work you raw.  Nice people.  Nice people over there, Caroline.  I don't mind.  I don't mind the shows.  I don't even need the money.  Give me a chance to perform.  It gives me a chance when I get off stage to watch the sunrise.  And how often do you get to see that?  Usually you get a nice night's sleep. 
[01:54:30]  I get to work all night long.  Thanks to Caroline's people for that show.  No, they're good people, man.  That's Satan.  I got a disclaimer part out of my show.  It's just added fat.  All right.  Well, we'll see you down at Caroline's tonight.  Yes.  Cool, man.  Great.  I know you said you've got to go.  We'd love to have you stay.  I've got to go to the eye doctor. 
[01:55:00]  I'll go to the ER.  No, man.  I might check out a little of the photo shoot out front.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Always going on out there.  Well, you want to bring the one in here?  Yeah.  Which one?  The one that was the showstopper.  Oh, right.  That distracted us all to the point where we almost didn't come back on the air.  This is dead air.  Out there with our tongues on our knees. 
[01:55:30]  Let me go to Caroline while we wait for her.  Oh, Caroline?  Or is it Caroline, Brian?  Oh, boy.  Caroline.  Caroline, yes.  Oh, I got that one right.  You did.  You did.  And no matter how many times I hear it, the Alpsons and Toy Line gets me every time.  Oh, Carol.  So, so funny.  Thank you.  I wanted to know, now that you have a son, a young son, if you're going to be doing anything  on Sesame Street or maybe a Disney deal or something like that, bringing it in for the  kids.  You mean for me to be on the show?  Yeah.  You know how they have, like, the celebrity people on Sesame Street and it always winds 
[01:56:00]  up that they've got a little kid?  I'm not at that level where I'm calling shots like that, but I certainly appreciate the thought  that you think I might be.  Yeah, well, I figured you've got to do it the next three years, otherwise Seinfeld's going  to beat you to it.  Yeah, I should just, like, call my manager up.  Get me on Sesame Street.  I want to tape it next week.  Maybe do some jokes about cookies, maybe, though.  Yeah.  Get to do it somehow.  I tell you, I would love to do that, though.  My wife has said that that would be cool. 
[01:56:30]  I think it would be.  Because the kids, you know, that's what they really relate to is that kid programming.  It's good for your street cred, as they call it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get them when they're young, man.  Yeah.  Yo, yo, yo, I saw you with Grover.  Yo, the whole new generation of fan base.  That's true.  Are you going to Caroline's this weekend?  I think I am tomorrow night.  Oh, great.  Brian doesn't come around often.  Well, thanks, man.  I hope you can get out there.  Come on down.  We're going to be having a par-tay.  All right?  Okay, thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Who do we got in the studio? 
[01:57:00]  Debra.  Debra came back for a reshoot?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Newbie Michelle.  Newbie Michelle.  How are you, Michelle?  Good.  Yeah?  Where are you from?  New Brunswick.  All right.  And do you have a nice butt?  I hope so.  Rick took pictures.  Like, what do you ask, you know?  Not bad.  So I'm told.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, Brian was, um...  Brian really needs to see your ass.  Brian's been away from his wife for a total of four hours, and his wife's a lovely lady. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  But you two look like nice ladies, too.  Oh, he goes, Dan.  You are magic.  You're smooth, Dan.  There is not one...  Who would say...  Is there anyone on earth that goes, that mother effing Brian Regan.  This guy's the biggest scumbag in the world.  Yeah.  Like, anybody out there that could possibly say that, Brian?  Well, tonight there's going to be about 500 little people. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  The little...  Well, you pissed them off.  Yeah, it was, you know...  Well, you didn't even mean to.  You didn't even mean to.  That's like the worst thing he's done.  He's probably...  I could see Brian at home, though.  Probably, like, has a phone where the number's not even listed.  He calls people up.  You're an a-hole.  I hate you.  What are you, Irish?  You're drunk.  Like, call us the black people out.  Gotta be all nice in my act and stuff, but I can't call us out. 
[01:58:30]  You gotta have an outlet to let loose.  Right.  And even then, when completely anonymous, I'd be too afraid to use the language.  You African-American!  Why, you person of another ethnic origin!  He'd make a great president, wouldn't he?  Oh, yeah.  Or a poor politician on any level.  So, ladies, Brian, you know, he's too shy to say it, but he was...  Wow! 
[01:59:00]  Look at this.  They're holding hands and stuff.  Very nice.  Nice!  Look at that.  Gotta see the shoes.  What do you think, Brian?  Well, what's amazing is both of them are facing the microphone.  That's what I...  They're giving Brian a good show.  That's...  There you go.  Yeah, they should be...  They're definitely good for the contest.  Hey, Brian, which one do you like better?  They're both equally...  Oh, God.  Of course.  They're both top contenders for the prize. 
[01:59:30]  Both equal in their loveliness.  I would rate both of them grade A.  Grade A?  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very nice, ladies.  We got some finalists in the studio.  Yeah.  I think Sticks is partial to Debra, though.  Think you like to Debra?  Dude, she pulled up her skirt and he just went,  Oh!  He made a sound?  He made a sound.  It wasn't even a word or anything.  Here, watch.  Give me my foot.  Give me a hand.  Oh. 
[02:00:00]  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  Thank you, ladies.  That never gets old.  Bravo.  Foot.  Foot.  Yes.  You still in the shed?  Yes.  Hey, I found something in here.  Check it out, man.  All right.  It's a toy.  See if you guess what it is.  Listen to this.  D-Dog.  D-Dog.  Robinson.  It's a lost in space robot.  You know about that thing.  Listen.  My sensors indicate an intruder is present. 
[02:00:30]  I hope he's not talking about my house.  Why would this be in your shed?  Yeah.  No, there's a bunch of crap out here.  I throw everything out here.  I got no room in the house.  Shouldn't that be in the attic?  There's a...  No, there's nothing in the attic.  You don't talk about the attic.  You kind of threw him for a loop with the whole attic topic.  Yeah.  This guy's out as well.  You're clear of the attic talk.  I'm going to have to call the cops.  All right.  Well, we just needed an update before we let Brian Regan go, so...  All right.  Thank you.  Good luck to you, Foot, man. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  I guess you won't be making a show.  Where's Brian going?  Brian, come over here.  Get me out.  That's why I'm leaving.  I got beer.  I got weed.  Come on.  I need a comedian.  I'm locked in the shed.  I need a comic.  Quickly.  That's a tough room.  I'm headed right there, Foot.  Yeah, take care.  All right.  All right, Foot.  Good luck, man.  Thank you.  Bye.  Hold on.  I'm holding...  All right.  Well, see what happens to Foot who's locked in his shed at home.  The only entertainment he has is this show on the phone.  All right.  Well, we'll see Brian Regan and Caroline.  I have a question for your beautiful guests. 
[02:01:30]  First of all, you have very nice, you know...  Asses.  Right.  You can use that word.  Booty.  I don't know.  Butts.  My question is, what are your thoughts on Kierkegaard?  I'm just being goofy.  I've never even read Kierkegaard.  I'm here acting like I'm all smart.  I don't even know who the hell I'm talking about.  I just throw in some reference of some book that's supposed to be...  Or some writer.  I don't even know if it's a book or a writer.  You ever read that book, Kierkegaard? 
[02:02:00]  Man, I hear that's real good.  Smart people read that kind of book.  I was just being silly.  Now they're discussing things amongst themselves, Brian.  What are you ladies going to know Kierkegaard inside and out made me look like the biggest moron?  What are you ladies discussing over there?  Nothing.  Uh-oh.  What were you just saying?  What were you saying?  I'm going to ask you a question.  Okay.  All right.  Do you know what a COX-2 inhibitor is?  A COX-2 inhibitor.  COX-2? 
[02:02:30]  Inhibitor.  Inhibitor?  A COX-2 inhibitor.  No, I don't.  What is it?  Well, he asked me that question.  I figured I'd ask him a question.  Ooh, touche, Brian.  Okay.  What is it?  What is it?  I can't correct it.  He said that was a book for smart people or an author.  It prevents you from coming.  Oh.  Well, I'm glad I don't know that.  I've never had to find that one out.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Thank you, ladies. 
[02:03:00]  I was just being silly with my question.  I hope you did.  Look at Brian.  He's got to make sure everything's okay.  I was just being playful.  A couple of potential customers.  You know, it's like...  Potential voters.  Why is it like this, Brian?  There's no way anyone can walk this globe that doesn't think you're just the nicest guy.  Apparently, I insulted these two ladies, and I didn't mean it that way.  Brian, before you go, you've got to talk to one of the dwarfs from last night. 
[02:03:30]  They're checking in.  Tommy.  Oh, no.  Tommy.  Hey, Tommy.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  What's your name?  Tommy.  Who's this?  Yes.  Yo, what's up?  Who's this?  Anthony?  Harvey?  And Brian Regan.  What's up, man?  I was on Minikiss last night.  You were part of Minikiss?  Yes, I was in the band, man.  All right.  I don't believe you.  Yo, I swear, man.  Come on, man.  What did you play?  I played the bass drum. 
[02:04:00]  I mean, the bass guitar.  Gene Simmons, bro.  Liar, liar.  All right.  Let me see.  What can we do to make you know?  Where are we standing?  What's your manager's name?  What's your manager's name?  I'm standing in the middle, man, with the bass guitar, red.  All right, wait.  What's your manager's name?  Jimmy.  Hey, hey.  Oh, is it?  All right.  Yes, it is.  All right.  You were a hit last night.  Now, what do you like being called?  Because we heard you.  All right.  Check it out.  Check it out.  You going to listen? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  I don't mind.  You know, I mean, everybody's going to do their thing.  It's cool.  I got my own things to do for other people.  But we like to be called Minikiss.  Okay?  Okay.  Okay.  Minikiss.  That's the band.  That's the band.  That's the band.  You know, she and I die.  But, yeah, the M word's got to go.  The what word?  The M word?  Now it's the M word.  See, I told everyone you guys don't like being called midgets.  What's wrong with Migger?  Hey, that's you.  I heard that, Brian. 
[02:05:00]  How do I backpedal out of this?  Let me go to the expert.  He was making a silly, playful joke.  I don't think he said what you thought he said.  You got a pissed off little person on the phone.  No, I'm not pissed off.  Don't start this, man.  Don't make it sound like I thought I mean.  Yeah, seriously.  Let me tell you what I called.  Okay.  I just want to tell you, you guys were awesome.  Cool.  Your stage people were awesome.  Cool.  You know, the crew members.  Yeah.  The audience, your following is really awesome. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  I had a really, really good time.  It was a...  I'm not here to start nothing, man.  All right.  It was one of the hits of the road show, and we enjoyed having you guys.  You're going to be at Don Juan's in Carl Place tonight?  Tonight?  We don't know.  I know we're going to be, I think, next week.  All right.  We're probably going to be tonight, yeah.  But, you know, I just want to say,  it was a positive thing.  I think you guys were awesome, like I said.  All right, Tommy, Tommy, this is boring people.  We're going to have you at another one, okay?  What do you mean? 
[02:06:00]  What?  Oh, another get-together thing?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  I just want to say you guys were awesome.  I had a good time with the following, Opie and Anthony, and the whole crew.  Tommy, so would you say we were...  What are you describing?  Here we go.  What are you doing now?  We just want to make sure we understand each other.  So we were...  Go ahead, Mike.  Go ahead.  What's up?  No, what were we?  We were...  To you last night, we were...  Awesome.  What are you saying? 
[02:06:30]  Awesome.  What were we?  You guys were awesome.  Okay.  You guys, Opie and Anthony, the crew, the following, you know, the people there.  Everybody was really cool, man.  You know, I think we got a really good response.  All right, thank you.  Well, we're going to have you again, all right?  Hey, man, any time.  If you want to come to the radio show, we will.  All right, Tommy, I've got to hang up on you, okay?  Yeah, man.  All right.  We'll talk to him another day.  A little person, Brian. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  I don't understand why you were using such bad language and words.  But that one caller said that the M word was okay.  Midget.  Depending on the...  Right.  If you're proportional, I guess.  Proportion.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Not that the other ones aren't...  Depends on what they're going to be just proportion, and that's not necessarily what they are.  Brian, Brian, what's going on?  Hey, you're a pharmacist? 
[02:07:30]  I'm a pharmacist tech, yeah.  I work in a pharmacy and everything.  All right.  Constitute inhibitor is not what those girls said.  It's the new drug for arthritis for people who can't tolerate the Motrin's and stuff.  Oh.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you.  But I'm sure the girls meant well.  I'm sure, you know, they know what they're talking about, if they're that good looking.  They're very cool people, man.  All right, Brian.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm first ramming my car and I can't see him, so... 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, have a good one, guys.  All right.  Well, let's get Brian Regan out of here.  Hey, I just want to say you guys are awesome, man.  There you go.  They were awesome.  Just like the little person said.  Thanks, Brian.  Thank you, Brian.  I appreciate you guys having me.  Looking forward to having you guys out there, man.  Yeah, it's going to be fun tonight at Caroline's.  Playing Caroline's all weekend long.  Three shows tomorrow, so call Caroline's for taking info, okay?  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony.  David Duke doing stand-up at the Apollo will get more left.

Noon to 3.  1027 WNEW.  Ah, Brian Regan was a blast today.  Yeah.  Once again, I want to thank him for stopping by.  Anthony, we might have some good news for Foot.  We're in the middle of a commercial break here.  Foot!  Foot!  You're still in the shed, right? 
[02:09:30]  No, I've escaped.  Of course I'm still in the friggin' shed.  All right, hold on.  And who are you looking for?  Anybody who knows me.  Come and get my ass out of this cold friggin' shed.  You were asking for a guy?  The robot's starting to look real good.  All right, what was one of the guy's names?  Uh, there was, uh, Gary and Ricky and Timmy Good.  All right, I think we got Ricky on the line.  Uh, Ricky!  Yeah?  You know this guy?  Is he in the shed again?  Come on.  I think you guys are just messing with us again. 
[02:10:00]  This is...  Listen, I never got stuck in no friggin' shed before.  He's a dickhead.  Is it...  Hey, Foot!  Yeah!  I'm on my way there.  I'm gonna let you out, but...  Oh, is it Ricky?  Get me out of here, though!  Yeah, me and look at me and I'm gonna let you out, but...  Uh...  Hey, why you guys...  Oh, God, you guys are so annoying.  I hear you.  He's annoying every time he does this.  I...  It's...  Obviously, it's a bit if you're saying every time he does this.  Listen, he's...  He's doing shtick, okay? 
[02:10:30]  It's whatever he's...  It's whatever he's called it.  He's making me out to be an a-hole, okay?  Like, uh, Foot gets stuck in the shed once a week.  Yeah.  It's not once a week.  Hey, Ricky!  Let me out of the shed so I can kick your butt.  I never got stuck in the shed.  What is he doing?  Ricky, go get a foot out of the shed, all right?  Where is he?  Ask him where he is.  He's in there with the robot again.  What?  Bye, Ricky, you douchebag.  Get out of here or what?  I guess he's on his way, all right? 
[02:11:00]  Where is he?  Anthony, brand new sponsor to the O&A show.  Yes.  Planet Java.  Yeah, something we're really, really digging in the back office.  It's an unbelievable new coffee drink from the fine people at Planet Java.  What does Rick have to say about this?  This is legal, isn't it?  I don't know.  Well, I love...  Anthony, I love my coffee drinks.  Love, love, love.  And I'm telling you right off the bat, this stuff is better than Starbucks.  Yeah.  I was into the Starbucks stuff for a while, but I got turned on to Planet Java a little 
[02:11:30]  while back, and the stuff is unbelievable.  They got, I think, three flavors that I've tried anyway, right?  What have I tried?  The chocolate, the caramel one?  Caramoca.  Caramoca.  That's really, really good.  Chocolate caramel in a coffee.  Right.  It's like a dessert.  It's great.  Makes a great mixer, too.  Roadshow last night.  I was feeling a little tired after the radio show, and this stuff is named right.  Tremble. 
[02:12:00]  Tremble.  I love Tremble from Planet Java.  You need a kick?  How about 121 milligrams of caffeine?  That ought to do it.  121 milligrams of caffeine.  This is like how many times stronger than Jolt?  I've heard, like, Caramoca.  Yeah, that's the low-fat one.  The packaging is pretty cool, too, Anthony.  Planet Java.  It's the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long, long time.  Planet Java, it ain't no social drink.  It's iced coffee that wants you to be yourself.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  And the sampling starts Monday, April 9th, when the Planet Java sampling trucks hit the streets  with your favorite new flavor.  So you've got to check it out for yourself.  We really are digging this stuff in the back office.  You know what would be cool?  You mix up the Tremble.  Maybe with some ice and some vodka.  It would be like a poor man's speedball.  You know what I mean?  Whatever it takes.  Try it for yourself.  I'm telling you.  Be yourself with Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude.  And available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  Iced coffee just got cool, and it's called Planet Java. 
[02:13:00]  Welcome aboard, guys.  Bang, and let's go, don't get into stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff, and the monkeys.  Welcome to the afternoon's coffee time.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to Bizarre World Pregnant 1027 WNEW.  Ah, Buck Cherry.  Steven Tyler with blonde hair. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  I'm looking at contestant Michelle for my pictures.  She's a slut.  Oh, my God, man.  Good stuff, isn't it?  Oh, yeah, best ass contest.  Really, um, really getting some quality contestants with this ass contest.  Well, there's a whole bunch of ladies outside the studio.  This is the last day to qualify, and a really hot-looking blonde just showed up. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, she's getting her pictures done.  All the pictures are going to be seen at WNEW.com.  I want to thank Pitical Horny Goat Weed for helping us out with this contest, and we'll  have the finalists up on Monday, and we'll start the voting, finally, to see who wins  the trip to Las Vegas, courtesy of Gear Magazine.  212-757-1027.  Triple H is just a couple minutes away from the studio.  Looking forward to talking to him from the WWF.  Sure.  We've got to ask him about the WWF purchasing the WCW today. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  That's some big news.  My God.  Boy, that's something.  You're going to see some people coming over.  Now, obviously, they own, now WWF is going to own all those guys.  Well, maybe we'll ask him and see what he knows, but...  I know nothing about WCW.  Nothing.  There's only one guy I would like to see for the WCW over at the WWF. 
[02:15:00]  Oh.  Goldberg.  Is he even with WCW still?  Oh, yeah.  What about the Hulk?  The Hulk?  No, the Hulk just kind of...  He just walked off one day, and that was it.  That's it for the Hulkster.  I thought maybe we'd get a, I want to be a Hulkamaniac again.  And he plays his guitar and tells you he'll take five of it again.  Morgan.  What's up, guys?  It's Morgan from IBetsYouWill.com that helped us out at the road show yesterday.  Hey.  Great show last night, guys.  I wanted to thank you so much for having us.  Yeah, that was a lot of fun, man.  That was our best one yet. 
[02:15:30]  Bro, it was incredible.  It was an unbelievable night.  I hope people understand that the pig head that you took out of the cooler, that was real.  That was a real pig head.  Because it kind of looked fake.  No, the thing was, it was a frozen pig head, and it just unthawed that day.  Right.  So that's why it was looking fake, because the blood was dried on it.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, but no, that guy made out with a real severed pig head.  Yeah, he was, he was tonguing it.  Yes, he was, and well, he was tonguing it well.  He'd had some experience, it looked like.  Yeah.  Are you going to have some of this footage up on the website?  The footage will be up on the site next week. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  It'll be up on Monday.  Cool.  Right on, guys.  I just wanted to thank you so much.  It was an awesome evening.  Thank you, Morgan.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right, bro.  From IBetsYouWill.com.  I just saw Triple H, man.  Yeah, he's effing huge.  Might as well.  Might as well.  All right.  Hey, there he is.  Triple H in the studio.  What's going on, man?  Hey.  You are so effing intimidating, man.  It's the big man. 
[02:16:30]  What's going on?  Hey, smile.  That helps us.  Oh, yeah.  We saw you at WrestleMania last year.  Where were we?  Yeah, in Anaheim.  Anaheim?  Yeah.  We were in the same hotel as you guys.  Yeah, the WWF game.  Yeah.  A nice trip.  And I saw you.  We were being mistaken a lot for the wrestlers.  You know?  And Opie and I were getting in the elevator.  People were like, hey, I think that's one of the guys.  Yeah, they thought you were like Jake Roberts on crack or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Hey, I got this before I forget, because I'll forget to give these ears for you guys for WrestleMania this year. 
[02:17:00]  Get out of here.  Yeah, and Steph's going to send a letter over there.  They're going to pay for you guys to fly out there, the whole deal.  Look at this.  You guys.  I thought you'd give us a build-up or something.  Like, I got a surprise for you.  You know, you just, you know, vlog our surprise.  Look at that.  It's WrestleMania tickets.  See that?  Remember last year?  Yeah.  When we went, Ivory came in and gave us the tickets last year.  Yeah, everybody would, you know, build up and do the big surprise. 
[02:17:30]  Right, right.  And screw that, right?  I need to go right for it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we saw you at the WrestleMania eating last year.  You were an intimidating mother-erper.  Why do you have a bodyguard, by the way?  Yeah, you're eating and, you know, you have a big guy next year.  Who's going to mess with you?  Last year at WrestleMania, actually, you guys said you were at the hotel.  I wasn't at that hotel.  They had to move me to a hotel across the way a bit.  They had some death threat problems with me and stuff like that, so they moved me across  the way and they had to have people with me.  Really?  Yeah.  What, is it just somebody taking the storyline a little too serious?  I think so, yeah.  I wanted Stephanie. 
[02:18:00]  I wanted her.  That son of a bitch.  You know, Steph's pretty hot, so you've got to be hot about that, you know.  That girl's gotten hotter, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  And when she first came on the scene, I always like to tease her about the fact that her acting  was so horrific.  Like when she was chained to the boiler room and she's all disheveled and, oh, daddy, somebody  help me.  It's like, oh, God, she's not pulling this off at all.  But she pulls off the bitch really well.  Really well.  I think that's because that's really her personality.  That's what I would say. 
[02:18:30]  Like it's got to be.  You know, so for her to play like an innocent little young girl is almost virtually impossible.  Wasn't washing, yeah.  If that had come off real, she'd have had to get the Academy Award or something.  Yeah.  Hey, I need one of these jolt, uh, tremble things or something you guys are talking about.  You want to try the tremble?  There you go.  Is that tremble?  Yeah.  This might geek me out fully.  I need, like, you have one that's not quite, like, do you have a half geek?  Like, wait a minute.  The other ones have a lot of caffeine, too.  No, you're big enough to try the tremble.  Just drink half of it, though.  I'll try the tremble. 
[02:19:00]  I'll just.  You're not going to sleep until four in the morning if you take that.  Oh, him shaking.  They'll pick that up on the seismic meters for earthquakes.  Hey, um, dude, I've been for WrestleMania.  Triple H, a lot of people writing in and stuff saying that the WWF fought WCW.  You know anything about that?  Yeah.  Um, I don't know that much about it, to be honest, because it just happened.  But, uh, yeah, we just, uh, we bought WCW and, uh, it's going to become our problem.  I don't know what we're going to do with the show or anything about what we're going to  do with it or anything like that.  But I think it's good, you know?  I know what you're going to do. 
[02:19:30]  You're going to get rid of all the lame wrestlers, take a couple of them over, and  then just, you know, blow up that league.  Yeah, they got a lot of lame wrestlers.  I said the only one I would like to see on the WWF is, uh, Goldberg.  I think a lot of people would like to see that, yeah.  Yeah, they got a few guys.  I mean, you know, the other thing, too, is I think that, uh, you know, a lot of guys  that over the last few years have been, like, really lame, you know, when you're working  for someplace that's that bad and management's that screwed up and there's no direction and 
[02:20:00]  everything is horrible, what kind of inspiration do you have to perform?  So I think that maybe some of those guys aren't really that bad, it's just they've been in  really bad conditions for a long time.  They just stopped caring, you know?  Right.  I think now, uh, maybe with us taking it over and, um...  I can't imagine Vince running two wrestling leagues is what I'm getting at.  And the XFL.  Right.  Everything else he's in right now.  Yeah, he's pretty amazing, though.  If anybody can do it, he can.  Right.  I don't know.  It would be good to see.  I kind of hope they keep him separated somehow because I think it's, uh, it's just vital to the 
[02:20:30]  business to have, you know, you can only sometimes maintain in one place  for so long and then you need to go someplace else maybe.  So it'd be good to have that option to go to a different, uh, different venue.  Right.  Hey, uh, speaking of Vince, did you see the interview with, uh, Costas?  Yeah, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  But, uh, how are you guys laughing?  It was great.  I, you know, that's tremendous to me.  It's like, he's like, uh, you know, when you're controversial like that, when you're famous  for controversy, and that's pretty much what he is, um, that's what people are expecting.  People, people watch that interview, they either loved it because he was, um, off the 
[02:21:00]  wall and that's what they want to see from him, or they thought he was an a-hole and,  you know, that's what they expected anyways because they think he's at anyway, so he just,  you know, if that's what they think, he might as well go with it.  So I thought it was great.  We loved it.  I was yelling at the TV.  It was some of the best TV I've seen in years.  When he, like, leaned over and got into that, how many times have you been on the receiving  end of that one?  Shut your mouth.  That's the thing, knowing him, you know, and seeing him on the edge of his seat like that,  when he said, you shut up, you know, I thought, oh, he's going to pop him. 
[02:21:30]  You never want to be on the receiving end of that one.  And then I thought, God, I hope someone's here to pull Costas off him.  That was funny because Costas kind of looked, he looked like he was really getting intimidated.  Oh, yeah, he was good at that.  But it was his show, so he kind of was obligated to stand up in some way.  So he's answering them back, but you saw in his face, it's like, please don't get me.  Well, that's where Bob Costas backed up in his chair.  I'm going to bend you over this chair. 
[02:22:00]  It's kind of like if you're at a bar or something like that, and you're with a hot chick,  and some guy starts coming over and giving her crap, and you have to stand up.  Right.  You know he's going to kick your ass.  But you have to.  Come on, man, just get off, you know.  That's kind of how Costas was looking.  He was looking like, oh, he's going to kill me.  But it's my show.  I've got to stand up for him.  You're doing your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  Hey, honey, you need a little help with that cap?  No, I can't.  If you're having some trouble unscrewing that, I might be able to loosen that up for you. 
[02:22:30]  I'm sure unscrewing you're good at.  Yeah, well, what can I say?  Oh, yeah, I'll come up there and kick your ass.  Like, I can't even say it with the same thing.  You're going to see him smiling because when he walked in, it's like, oh, what the hell?  Yeah.  It sucks.  He could just take over the whole show.  Here's a letter from Steph.  Oh, really?  Oh, handwritten?  Yeah, handwritten, but back silver.  We were actually supposed to pick it up on the way, but the courier had just left with it to take it to where we were when we got there.  So it was like, Keystone Cop. 
[02:23:00]  Anthony, you are my dream.  Well, she signed it.  See you in Houston.  What does that mean?  Does that mean, you know?  It means you're going to Houston.  No, but what does that mean?  Is she going to personally see us in Houston?  Maybe.  And what do we get?  You got tickets to the show, I'm guessing.  We love Stephanie.  There you go.  Wow.  The last time we saw her, we had this awkward moment I did where, like, she went for the hug and I went for the handshake.  And I was kind of thinking there might be something there.  I know you're married to her.  You kind of have that thing where she's going for one thing, you're going for another, you bump heads. 
[02:23:30]  You have the awkward moment.  Go for the handshake and a hug and a kiss.  And then she had to point out, boy, that was kind of awkward.  I'm like, yeah, I'm a cool thing.  Thank you for bringing it up.  Yeah, right.  Appreciate it.  God, how long are you guys going to stay married in the storyline?  My God.  It's been quite a while.  Her dad's a billionaire.  It has been a while.  I'm just waiting for the day that she turns on you and kicks your ass.  Yeah, well, you know.  It's going to happen.  And I can't wait for it. 
[02:24:00]  I mean, obviously, when you guys announced that you were married, first it looked like  obviously you were swindling her into marrying her in Vegas.  And then when she was in on it, that was just huge.  That was one of the best stories I've ever had.  Yeah.  The only way to top that is now eventually she's just going to smack you in the face.  Oh, yeah, it's bound to happen.  But, you know, it's just one of those things you kind of, you just ride it until you can't  get anything more out of it, I guess, you know what I mean?  And then you go that way.  But, you know, who knows what's going to happen?  You know, we go with it and then when it isn't working anymore, we'll go the other  way.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  When do you guys find out about the storylines?  Like when something drastic is going to happen?  It depends.  I mean, sometimes we're part of creating it.  You know what I mean?  But it depends.  Some of that stuff is you can be thinking you're going to go completely one way and then somebody  goes out on TV to do something like on Monday.  And when you see it happen, you go, oh, God, we got to go the other way with this.  You know, I mean, even as far as the thing with Steph went, you know what I mean?  It was we kind of had an idea where we were going to go with it.  And when we saw it on TV that first week after we went to the Vegas thing, we were like, 
[02:25:00]  oh, it'd be great if we did this.  You know, we just went with it and it worked out great.  But I have a feeling at first that was supposed to be like a small storyline, but then it  just took off and the audience really dug it that you guys just expanded on it.  Well, in the beginning of it, it was something that was designed.  It was when we used to have one of our other writers before, Vince Russo, that went to WCW  and he had originally come up with this idea with Steph and Tess and this whole wedding  thing, but he had no plan for where it was actually going to go. 
[02:25:30]  So they left and they were stuck.  Now they have this huge storyline of like this wedding and this whole thing.  I have to finish it, yeah.  Yeah, with no place to go.  And they had to postpone it a couple of times because they had no, you know, they didn't  know what they were going to do with it.  And then finally we come up with this.  That's working perfectly.  Now, is he over at WCW and it's been a quad because...  I'm guessing he was.  Yeah, because I don't think...  Yeah, he would have him back.  No, I think that's one guy that's not going to have a job.  Yeah.  He went against Vince big time. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, you never say never in this industry.  I've learned that.  Right.  I don't know.  It burnt Vince pretty hard, I would imagine.  I'm just guessing.  I don't know all the details on that.  But, you know, we'll see.  And things didn't work out for him that great down there.  He went down there touting he was going to be all this stuff and it really didn't work  out.  They actually went in deeper into the hole and, you know, they kind of just shelved him.  So, what about your real life relationships?  We've heard some things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who are you married to? 
[02:26:30]  I'm not married to anybody.  You're not married to anybody.  See?  There you go.  Okay.  All right.  Now, what was this with you and China?  China and I used to be together.  Oh, you were?  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because I heard married.  He's going to kick your ass.  What?  I'm asking questions.  I don't know.  That's cool.  Yeah.  He's going to kick your ass.  Shut up.  I'm just hoping people don't remember what I said about China.  What did you say?  Remind Triple H.  You said, I'll repeat it.  He said that in the Playboy spread, that from the back, she looked like she had a man-ass. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  Because she's so muscular.  A man-ass?  Yeah.  She's obviously a playboy.  So are you saying Triple H likes man-ass, Opie?  Let me try to explain before he crushes me.  Hey, some guys have nice asses.  Look at all that coming.  If they work out, you know.  I think this is going to work out after all.  Look at all that coming.  Look at me sweating like a pig.  I know.  You know, like our producer, Rick, loves the muscle girls, okay?  Yeah.  I never really got into that. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, look at me.  You know what I mean?  It's just like, you know, to me, like, I...  She's got a great body.  I understand that.  It's like, wow, she works longer.  Would you guys just grease up in a mirrored room and have sex and stuff?  Look at how attractive we are.  Sometimes I do that by myself.  You know, I get a good grease and some...  And now we're alone in the hotel.  What the hell?  Hey, you took that one pretty well.  Thank God.  Nobody else is around.  Date yourself.  That's the way I see it.  But you know what? 
[02:28:00]  We asked a lot of the guys from the WWF that came in.  We asked what they thought of her spread in Playboy.  And most of the shots were cool.  But that one shot where it was just from the back in her butt, I was bothered by that.  But no one would admit it.  It's funny, I think, that muscular women like that, it's either something you really dig  or you're really not into.  There's, like, no in-between, you know what I mean?  And, you know, I think it's cool.  But to me, you know, it's just like nothing against her but like Jennifer Lopez.  Everybody puts her butt over it.  She's got like a big fat ass. 
[02:28:30]  I don't see what the big deal is.  Right.  Way too much junk in that trunk for me.  Yeah.  But you talk about it enough and people pump it up.  Yeah, I guess so, you know.  But, I mean, realistically, I mean, she's got a big fat ass.  Have you seen it in person?  Not in person.  Because they cover it up nice on TV.  Yeah, but when you do see it now and then, you know.  You're like, whoa.  It's there.  Yeah, it's there.  That had to be rough, though, seeing somebody right there who you work with and around.  As far as when you were seeing China? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, it's obviously awkward any time you're in relationships or getting out of them.  I mean, it's very awkward.  Yeah.  And it still is, you know.  Is it?  Yeah, it's still difficult.  Who, uh.  Working through it.  Well, you got your job.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, now you're still together.  It's not like you just blow off your girlfriend or something like that or she blows you off  and then you don't see each other again.  Now you've got to work with her and deal with her and stuff.  Who gave who the boot, man?  You know, it's just kind of a mutual thing right now.  Yeah.  It just kind of.  It just happened.  But frigging ditched him, man. 
[02:29:30]  Right.  You know, the funny thing you were talking about, the guy coming on here.  Yeah.  Yeah, I am.  Good move.  You go wherever you want.  I know the guy coming on here talking about Chyna's thing in Playboy.  And the funny thing is that I think if that would have been almost anybody else in our  company, guys would have been all over that thing, like, you know, putting posters up  and making fun of it and just, you know, blistering it and stuff.  But it's funny, the guys with Chyna, she's so much, she's like a sister to all those guys.  You know, she's been around so long, she's like a sister to them. 
[02:30:00]  Like, you know, it'd be like 350 pound guys that would just rip anybody apart.  And then, like, Chyna said, did you see my Playboy thing?  They go, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was very nice.  You know, all dorks, like, you know, it was funny.  That's cool.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  I mean, people want to ask you questions.  I mean, the phone's going nuts here.  Cool.  We'll talk about WrestleMania a little bit, and you're enjoying the Planet Javo?  Yeah, I didn't go for the Tramble, but I did have this other one.  I ripped the label off, so I don't know what's going to do.  It's all right, though, right? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, it's pretty good stuff.  I'm digging it.  New sponsors for this show.  They'll probably advertise it at WWF.  Who knows?  I'm digging it.  We'll be back.  Wow.  Peace.

[02:31:30]  There happens to almost a look.  I think you're talking about me.  Mokey.  I'm a Topey radio guy.  Anthony.  I'm just being wacky.  Topey and Anthony show.  We are a bunch of people.  3-51027.  W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony, this is cool.  We got Triple H in the studio for the WWF.  And I was telling them while the commercials were playing, we were scared to have them on  the show.  I'm not going to lie.  Kind of intimidating on TV. 
[02:32:00]  We said some weird things about China.  Hope he was a little nervous.  He's nervous.  He's a nervous kind of guy.  I saw you had a sense of humor, you know.  But then.  You're a regular guy that could hang.  But then we find out he used to listen to us when we were up in Boston.  Yeah, he used to listen to you guys all the time.  Then one day, he wasn't there anymore.  I went home off the road, turned the radio on.  Hey, where'd they go?  You guys would get canned.  Gone.  He wants to see some of the asses, Ant.  Best ass contest.  Yeah, sponsored by Pinnacle Horny Goat Week. 
[02:32:30]  You got any girlfriends now or anything like that?  Well, you know, I'm not at liberty to say.  But I'm not opposed to seeing some asses.  Great, okay.  Fine.  Okay.  No problem.  Mark Carano, our publicity guy from the WWF.  All of a sudden, he just wandered into the room, right?  Oh, there's an ass contest.  Yeah.  Yeah, we never see this guy.  Just got to make sure nothing's going on in there.  Make sure you're okay.  All right, bring the ladies in.  Let's talk to Phil while they get the ladies in here. 
[02:33:00]  Phil, you got a question for Triple H?  Yeah, Triple H.  What do you think about the King leaving?  What do I think about the King leaving?  You know, hey, Jerry made his own decision.  The WWF had a problem with his wife, and they felt like it was in their best interest to let her go.  You know, I guess he decided that if they were going to let her go, he was going to leave.  I think maybe he thought they would try to stop him, but that's his decision.  Wow.  He doesn't want to hang out because his wife's leaving.  That's his business.  I was convinced it was a storyline.  I asked Triple H.  He goes, no, it's as real as he gets.  But that could even be a storyline. 
[02:33:30]  What about Triple H?  Yeah.  What about Paul Henning?  What's the name?  Paul Henning, whatever the name is.  Paul Henning.  Paul Henning.  Yeah.  What do you think of him?  What do I think of him?  Yeah, you think he's doing a good job?  Yeah, I think he's a great guy.  I mean, I think from an announcing standpoint, you know, he's different.  And people, it's, you know, when you switch from one thing to the next, it's going to take a little while to get used to it.  And I think that people are going to take a little while used to get him.  He's different from King.  He's a little bit more serious.  But I think he's doing a great job.  And I think he's a genius behind the scenes. 
[02:34:00]  The stuff he did with ECW, you know, yeah, it went out of business.  But, you know, from a production standpoint and from what he had to work with, I think he's a genius.  So, I mean, I'm a huge fan of his.  And I think that it would be great for us to have him.  All right.  Thank you, fellas.  Thank you.  Hey, what was the problem with the King's wife with the WWF?  You know, I'm not really dead sure.  I don't really know.  I just know that, I don't know, they weren't happy with something.  And they decided that it was in their best interest to part ways. 
[02:34:30]  And he didn't think that way, I guess.  Do you think she, like, might have gone up to him and said, if you go back there, it's either them or me kind of thing.  Because if that's the case, that would be awful for him.  Hey, I mean, I would imagine that has to be what happened, right?  You know, it's his wife, right?  Which I'm sure his wife had to say, I can't believe you're just going to let him fire me.  So, he wouldn't say something.  He went in there saying something, probably saying, you know, if you're firing my wife, I've got to leave, too. 
[02:35:00]  Thinking they'll just say, well, all right, we'll keep the King and appease him.  But, you know, it went down.  And that's that.  That's that.  I'm seeing hardcore porn outside.  We had the King on our show.  He has naked pictures of her.  He has naked pictures of her.  And he made sure he told us where we could find him.  I thought he was a great guy after that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't think King has any problem with the cat giving nudity or showing it to anybody else.  Stu, what's going on?  Guys.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  I wanted to ask Triple H two questions. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  First of all, I wanted to know, does China have a schween?  Oh, he's going to kill us.  Stu.  Be real, dick.  Okay, and are you interested in the best-ass contest or the man-ass contest?  Oh, people in New York are so funny sometimes.  If this kid came up to you, he'd crap himself before he would say anything like that.  He sounds like he already has crapped himself.  Ladies, Triple H wants to see some asses.  Yeah.  Oh.  He wants to see some butt.  Look how easy that was. 
[02:36:00]  It's so easy to get girls.  I like a girl that's not the guy to be nude.  Girl clothes off.  All these girls, their pictures are up on www.com so you can play along at home.  All right.  Let's take a look at the asses.  That's pretty good.  Any comments, Triple H, about that one?  Those are pretty good.  Nice.  Okay.  All right.  I see.  That's sure.  Okay.  No rubbing.  Oh, you know what?  That just reminds me.  I left my garage door open at home.  All right.  Nice.  Nice.  All right.  Well, go ahead.  Over there.  Yeah.  There we go.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  All right.  She's got good attire, too. 
[02:36:30]  I'm digging the little piece of string thing.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little floss.  Yeah.  She's not afraid to work it, either.  No, she's not.  She's done this before.  Yeah.  There's Rick with the big arms right there.  That's the big arms that Sandy was talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sandy, I'm busy looking at asses, would you?  You're killing me.  Rick takes the pictures.  Yeah.  For the best ass contact.  Somebody was just winking at me.  Oh.  Oh.  That was Rick.  That's our own.  Hey, Joe, you got a question for Triple H? 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  I wanted to know if Triple H would ever think about fighting Shawn Michaels in a match for  the leader of the DX with the other four members of DX in each corner?  Well, since DX doesn't exist anymore, I'm imagining that probably wouldn't be a very good storyline  right now.  But, yeah, I mean, if Shawn Michaels came back and wanted to wrestle, Shawn Michaels is a tremendous  talent.  So one way or the other, if he comes back in any way, shape, or form, whether he's on the  same side of the ring for me, or whether he's on the other side of the ring, it'd be great 
[02:37:30]  because he's a hell of a talent.  So I'd love the opportunity to work with him on either side.  Say it on our show.  Because I heard that he was supposed to fight you at WrestleMania, but he didn't want his  first match to be a loss.  That's why they changed the match.  Well, did you talk to Shawn about that?  No.  I'd imagine it's just a rumor then.  So you can tell us.  Shawn Michaels is coming back.  To be honest, you know, I've heard he wants to.  I just don't know from a physical standpoint.  I don't even know if really if Shawn knows. 
[02:38:00]  You know, that's kind of one of those things where nobody's really going to know until he  gets in the ring.  I mean, he might come in the first day and he tries to get back in the ring and go down  with that.  Screw this.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, because he's got a pretty serious back injury or had.  Right.  And I mean, I know he feels good now, but you never know until you start trying it.  And, you know, I just hope he's not mentally thinking I can come back and physically he  can't.  Right.  But hopefully he can because he's a tremendous talent.  We saw him at the hotel last year.  And it's so weird when you just see him pushing the little baby carriage around out of the 
[02:38:30]  pocket.  You know, it's just something to take you right out of the picture.  You know, heartbreak kid.  Oh, he's got a.  Yeah.  He's pushing the carriage and you're like, oh, let me start.  Hey, ladies, you seem bored over there.  Well, I just.  That's Triple H.  They just kind of put the butts away.  I know.  Yeah.  It was like a two second show.  The butt drove away.  Would you like to show him.  You want to show him something else?  You want to show him something else?  Something exciting here.  A wowing? 
[02:39:00]  No wowing or anything?  Any wowing going on?  Yeah.  He's been on the road.  I'm fine.  What happened?  I did nothing about that last week.  But he's famous and stuff.  You did enough.  You did enough wowing?  Yeah.  At our road show.  Oh, yeah.  There's probably a story there.  I'm going to wow.  Yeah.  Give a wow.  Why not?  Yeah.  Wow the Triple H.  Oh, there you go.  Those are nice.  Very nice.  Very good.  Okay.  Anyone else for Triple H?  Ladies.  Hey, the small ones are good too.  All sizes.  All sizes.  Yeah, we like all sizes.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Very nice.  Yes.  Okay.  She's shy over there.  The one with the little black bra.  Oh, she's just showing the bra?  Well, no.  She's working at it.  She's having a hard time working the lock or something.  Love that.  All right.  We got the combination.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  We're hanging with Triple H and a bunch of lovely ladies.  Cool.  Hey, Triple H.  What's up?  What's going on?  Hey, I got a question for you.  Sure.  With all the talent that's coming into the WWF at this point, is it hard for the egos not 
[02:40:00]  to start clashing?  I mean, everybody else went out of business but you guys.  You guys have stayed on the top.  Is it harder to stay hungry, I guess, to keep the ratings up and not push certain people  and keep certain people back or is it something that you're working on as it goes along?  No.  I mean, I think that's a work in progress but I think that, of course, everybody wants  to be the best.  Everybody wants to be on top.  You know, and I just think that it's just all about working hard.  Whoever has the most talent is going to work the hardest. 
[02:40:30]  They're going to be on top.  And if somebody wants to come along and push the envelope, that's great because it just makes  the rest of us work harder.  I'm where I got.  Austin's where Austin got.  Rock's where Rock got because we all worked our asses off to get there.  If somebody else wants to come and work just as hard as we did and try to get to the  top, that's great because I'll work that much harder to stay there.  Nice.  All right.  Let's move on to Stu.  Stu, what's going on?  Oh, and hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Stu.  Hey, John Paul.  Who do you hang out with after and, you know, throw a couple back with? 
[02:41:00]  I'm sorry?  Who do you drink with after the show?  Who's like the big party?  Any guys you get along with more than other guys?  I don't drink but usually like after the shows, I usually travel with Steve Regal and  X-Pac and stuff like that.  You know, we kind of go down the road together and stuff.  But, I mean, I get along.  You know, the thing about the WWF is we're all on the road together, you know, like 200 days  a year.  It's like a big family, you know?  Some guys you get along with more than others.  Other guys, you know, you're just more of a casual friend to.  But in the long run, you're all kind of brothers. 
[02:41:30]  If something went down, we'd all be right there for each other, you know what I mean?  And that's just the way it works.  You work against each other and you do all this stuff.  But, in essence, it's like a big group of family, you know?  Is there one guy in particular, though, that everybody's just kind of like, oh, jeez, he's  coming over here.  He doesn't shut up or, you know, he stinks or something.  No, not really.  There used to be some guys like that more so, I think, than now.  You know, like, you know, I think there used to be like when Vader used to wrestle for us. 
[02:42:00]  Vader.  I remember Vader.  Leon used to have, like, a particular pungent odor to him.  And he used to actually, some guys would wrestle him and actually get a little bit of a rash sometimes.  We used to call it Vader time.  You got Vader time, you know?  Oh, God.  And then, like, if he would be putting his mask on or something like that,  and there'd be like a little thing in the back that he'd have to tie. 
[02:42:30]  And when he'd take his mask out and go to put it on, it'd be like people scramble  because nobody wanted to have to touch the...  He'd go, can you tie that for me and everybody'd run, you know?  Because nobody wanted to have to touch his mask.  Your hands would stink for days.  That's good.  That's the inside info.  Speaking of stinking, the stink face.  Yeah.  That's got to be a lot of fun in the back.  You know.  When one of you guys have to take that.  Well, you know what it is, though?  It's because there's...  When you're...  Like, when you do what we do, there's a lot of subtleties to what we do. 
[02:43:00]  And we can see them,  and I don't think the average person can see them.  And there's a big difference in stink faces.  Two, one is, you know, the positioning and how deep the stink face is.  Yeah, yeah.  And all the things that go along with it.  I believe there's probably also a...  Probably a hygiene issue prior,  depending on how much Rikishi likes you.  Oh, God.  So, when it's somebody that...  He doesn't really like...  Yeah, I shouldn't necessarily...  It's not somebody that we don't like,  but it's somebody that maybe needs to have a little bit of a prank played on them, 
[02:43:30]  or somebody that you wouldn't mind...  Oh, man.  ...getting a good laugh on.  Sometimes the stink face can have a little bit more stink to it than normally.  Yeah, because sometimes you just see,  maybe the cheek is brushing against the face,  and the person's like,  all right, they got off easy.  But there are some that just get sunk deep.  Deep.  Yeah, other times...  Front face, right there.  Dingleberries in the hair after.  Oh, man.  That is nasty. 
[02:44:00]  That's funny.  Jay, you have a question for Triple H?  Yes, I do.  How are you doing, Triple H?  I'm good.  How are you?  Oh, you three are a tag team.  I would back any day, believe me.  Triple H, Opie, and Anthony.  Anyway, Triple H, I wanted to ask you,  do you ever get tired of playing the heavy?  You know, would you like to lighten up and be the good guy for a while?  No, I like what I do.  You know, I'm more comfortable in the ring,  playing the heel and being the bad guy.  I enjoy it.  I enjoy getting under people's skin,  and I enjoy working on that side of it more so than I do the other side. 
[02:44:30]  But, you know, when the time is right,  you know, you can only stay one side for so long.  After a while, they kind of force you to go the other way.  And when the time's right, I'll go the other side.  But, I mean, for right now, I love what I'm doing.  Jay, I'm kind of bummed he's in here,  because I love to hate Triple H when I watch.  And now it's like, oh, that guy's cool, man.  Yeah, I know what you mean.  He's such a while.  Yeah, just punch him in the face.  Bring his girlfriend back.  You know, I guarantee he'll hate me before I go. 
[02:45:00]  And there's nothing else we can do about it.  There you go.  All right, Jay.  Talk to you later.  We should get him a radio show here at N.E.W.  Funnier than half the people around here.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, brother?  What's up, brother?  I was talking about something on the Internet that you and Goldberg had got some kind of argument  or a fight at the confining or something like that.  Something like that was true or not.  Yeah, there was some kind of thing on the...  I don't even know actually what the deal with it is, because he and I have never talked about it. 
[02:45:30]  I've only met him one time, a long time ago.  And supposedly he read or he heard something that I said, I guess, derogatory towards him.  And I don't know.  I might have said it.  I might not have.  You know, you always read things on the Internet or hear things.  And so Steph and I were at an autograph session in Vegas, I think, or something like that.  And WCW had a booth there also.  And while we were signing, we were kind of late, so we were running in there last minute.  And we had this huge crowd.  We were in there signing away.  And all of a sudden, from about 30 feet away, I see Goldberg. 
[02:46:00]  And he's just yelling obscenities at me, telling me he's going to kick my ass.  And we're in like this, you know, Las Vegas convention center with all these business people in suits and old people and stuff like that.  He really kind of embarrassed himself.  And, you know, he sent word to other people that, you know, he made a mistake and that he was sorry and he flew up the handle and stuff.  But, you know, my advice to Bill would just be from now on, like, if I say something that makes him mad, just come up and ask me to speak to me in private. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, because you'd bitch him anyway.  It don't matter.  Well, you know, one way or the other, but, you know, walk up to me like a man and say, let me talk to you about something for a second.  And then if we go, we go.  But we can go in private.  We don't have to do it in front of the world, you know.  All right.  That's a lot, sir, Bill.  Because if I fight him, it's going to cost a lot of money for somebody to promote.  Yeah, right.  There you go.  You talk to Bret Hart at all?  No.  No.  I've not seen.  Last time I saw Bret Hart was probably, I guess, Owen Funeral. 
[02:47:00]  Really?  A long time, yeah.  Are we on speaking terms at all, Dan?  Bret left under very odd circumstances, and I believe that his belief was somehow that I had something to do with...  Yeah, I saw that video.  Yeah, in the documentary that his wife was, you know, in part of that documentary, his wife's chewing me out in the hallway,  and, you know, I'm just kind of sitting there taking it.  What do you say to the guy's wife, you know?  But, you know, I mean, that's Bret's business.  I mean, you know, I was in the position just like everybody else was, and I didn't know what the hell was going on. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, because you're just standing there going, hey, well, why?  You know, what are you yelling at me for?  Yeah, and, you know, for some weird reason, I guess he believes that I was a part of that, or I had something to do with it, or whatever,  and so he's always had a problem with it since then.  But, you know, that's his business.  I have no beef against him, and I have no, you know, beef with anybody.  I treat people how they treat me, and, you know, if he has a problem with me, that's his business, not mine.  Did you see Vince walking out after he got popped?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:48:00]  My God.  That was unbelievable.  That man took one for the team that night.  Yeah, he was a little wobbly walking down the hall.  Yeah.  Melissa.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up?  You got something for Triple H.  You were so prim and proper when you were Lord Helmsley.  Why the water over the head before you go in the ring?  Because my hair is long, and when it's dry, it gets in my mouth, and I choke on it, and stuff like that.  And it gets to pull it back, and it looks so nice and everything, and dry, and it's just a mess.  Then it comes out of the little ponytail thing, and then I'm breathing, and it goes down my throat, and I'm in the ring, hacking. 
[02:48:30]  Nothing worse than that.  Well, you're excellent, I have to tell you.  You know, sometimes when something goes down your throat, and it gags you.  Yeah, you know, like...  And then you get that bag reflex thing going on.  It happens with hair, too, sometimes, you know.  Exactly.  All right, Melissa.  You guys rule.  Thank you.  Another classic with the two pictures, the one of you and Stephanie that were up so long when you first hooked up those two ridiculous pictures.  Oh, and it was like the worst picture.  Right, yeah, yeah.  I said at first, I asked, can't you guys get a better picture of me now? 
[02:49:00]  It was great that it was two awful pictures.  Oh, it was horrible.  Ryan wants to know, has any wrestler ever farted in the ring?  Sure, at some point, somebody has.  There's got to be a time where someone just let one go, and I was just...  Had to mess up the whole story.  Don't lie up for the pedigree.  You know what?  A long time ago, when we used to do a lot of overseas tours, we don't go as much now because our TV schedule in the States is so hectic,  but we all went to India for like six days. 
[02:49:30]  It was the worst tour ever.  I mean, we were over there for a while.  Oh, and they screwed up.  They were supposed to bring food over from the U.S., and they were supposed to bring a chef over,  and something happened, and it didn't show up, so we had to eat their food and all the stuff,  and everybody just got violently ill, except for X-Pac, who the first day we were there,  I went to go get him in his room, and he was drinking water out of the sink,  and I was like, man, dude, you can't do that.  And he goes, oh, it doesn't bother me, and he was the only guy that didn't get sick.  The rest of us got violently ill, and guys were not just... 
[02:50:00]  farting in the ring, but that tour was brutal.  I mean, we were going through a modium like tic-tacs.  I mean, guys, just like two minutes into the match, you'd be like, oh, never mind, you know.  We've got to get out of here, dude, you know.  That's good.  Hey, we've got to talk about WrestleMania, because we're almost out of here.  You're fighting Undertaker, right?  The Undertaker the first time.  Yeah, I'm going to wrestle Undertaker.  You know, we've had matches before. 
[02:50:30]  But I mean, as far as the WrestleMania stuff, right?  As far as pay-per-view and serious stuff between the two of us,  we've never actually been, like, at a big feud or anything like that with each other.  So this is kind of the first time, and it's pretty cool.  He's been through a few incarnations, man.  That's kind of interesting how it pops up.  It's funny, too.  People were on him a little bit now for a few months about his character change and stuff.  But now I think people are digging it.  I like it.  I think he's cool the way he is right now.  A lot more realistic.  I mean, you know, the whole dark thing was starting to get a little out there, you know what I mean? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, you know, it's kind of still a holdover from the old days, you know.  And now it's a little bit more realistic and stuff.  And he's a great guy.  I'm really looking forward to working with him.  And I think that, you know, I plan on going to WrestleMania and stealing the show.  So there you go.  He's making it sound like they're friends and stuff.  No, I hate the Undertaker.  He sucks.  I can never.  I got you in the head last night with a sledgehammer.  How much can I make?  You've got to hate the guy. 
[02:51:30]  I was bummed out because the Undertaker, does anyone remember he killed the Big Boss Man and nothing came of it?  You know what happened?  Big Boss Man is hanging by the neck.  He's dead.  You've got to, I'm like, wait a minute, there he is now.  And the next Raw or whatever, all of a sudden.  He's okay.  He's okay.  What happened?  That's good.  That was in like Philadelphia where they did a Hell in a Cell match and he hung up the Boss Man from the show.  At the end, yeah.  So like, I want to say not even like a month later, we were in, that was in Philly, I think, that pay-per-view. 
[02:52:00]  And like a month later, we were in Philly again.  And it was a six-man tag and it was Boss Man B and Undertaker.  And I'm standing in the ring.  And Undertaker's walking to the ring and Boss Man goes, you know, last time I was in this ring, Undertaker killed me.  And I looked at him and I was like, that's kind of weird, isn't it?  And now we're all on the same team going to wrestle somebody else.  One of those storyline faux pas, I guess.  Hey, how's Road Dog doing?  I know he's let go and stuff.  Yeah, you know, I've not talked to him, to be honest. 
[02:52:30]  He's going through some really rough times home and things like that.  And he's kind of a personal guy when he's home.  And I just haven't been in touch with him since he's moved.  And I don't have his numbers now.  And I hear little things from other people that have seen him and stuff like that on Key Tabs and how he's doing.  But I've not really talked to him, so I can't really say.  But, you know, I hope he's doing well because he's a great guy.  He's a really, really talented guy on a lot of different ways. 
[02:53:00]  He can sing and he's a hell of a performer.  He just, you know.  He was in rehab and all that?  Yeah, he's just got a little bit of problems.  And hopefully he can get them all straightened out.  Yeah.  You know.  Cool, man.  We better show him some asses because that got a little too serious.  These two girls are on top of each other.  Yeah, what's going on over there, lady?  We're chatting away like, well, you guys are all of a sudden.  And you turn to the right and there's girls and people in laps.  We do have the lesbian couch, you know, if you want to get a little more comfortable. 
[02:53:30]  Every time a number of girls show up here, they always end up a couple of them in a chair, hugging and stuff.  It never happens.  I always like when you guys are on the radio and you guys can get, like, just because you're on the radio, you guys can get girls to do, like, wacky stuff with each other.  Yeah, you just like, like, you guys kiss.  Like, right now, big dumb kiss.  What are you going to give us if we do that?  You're on the radio.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's not enough.  Look at the web plugs.  Not enough.  That's Triple H.  Yeah.  You're not doing it for us.  Do it for me.  Look, you're sitting on laps. 
[02:54:00]  You're hugging.  You're hugging.  Yeah, but give me something.  Little kiss.  I just want to see if Triple H has a pimp head.  Karano will give you a picture.  I'll sign it if you make out with him, too.  Gina, I love you, but forget it.  Good job.  See that?  No, huh?  Nothing?  Oh, well.  Nothing?  What kind of city is this?  Nothing?  Yeah.  We promised him.  When you guys were in Boston, these kids should be...  Ah, yeah.  You're right. 
[02:54:30]  That's right.  No, no, no, no.  See, if you're going to give me the autograph picture without kissing him, yeah, I mean, her...  Okay, yeah, go ahead.  You and her, and I'll give you the autograph picture.  Yeah, there you go.  Karano, I ain't touching my skin.  There we go.  Here we go.  Nice.  Can you get some mercy on me?  Share your gum.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Ooh.  All right.  What?  Oh.  I think I'm getting up to go over.  Hey, she's a bullet.  With the pimp head.  All right.  We've worked it. 
[02:55:00]  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  Keep it going.  All right.  How much longer do we got on the air?  All right.  Take this Planet Java bottle.  All right.  New sponsor, you know.  I go home and tell my girl, hey, I did too.  That was very good, yeah.  What else do we need to say about WrestleMania?  Because...  To hell with that.  I know.  Yeah, right?  All right.  Work with us.  WrestleMania April 1st.  And Houston.  Houston.  65,000 people.  It's going to be...  Yeah.  I believe it's sold out right now. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  And it's going to be a hell of a show live on pay-per-view.  And WrestleMania is like the Super Bowl for us.  So the buzz has already started.  You know, we can't wait to get there and get going.  What do you think of Vince, Shane, Angle?  I think Vince and Shane is going to beat the hell out of each other.  Yeah.  That'll be interesting.  I think they're just going to chase each other around and run away from each other.  No, because Shane always wants to, like, fly through some furniture or something.  Yeah, yeah.  He is a crazy son of a bitch.  Here's a kid that just is set for multi-lifetimes. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  And he's throwing himself around like a rag doll.  Well, I mean, you know, look at his dad, right?  Yeah.  His dad's like a billionaire, runs a billion-dollar company, and he's flying off the top of a  steel cage, landmark tables, and the next day he can't walk, his ass is all bruised  up, and, you know, he's beat to hell, and, you know, he's out there just taking guys'  finishes and stuff like that, and just, you know, he's crazy.  He's like a big kid.  That's got to be hysterical throwing the boss around, though.  Oh, yeah, it's great.  What other job can you go to and beat the hell out of your boss? 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  You give it a little extra when he pisses you off?  Just a little, you know?  Yeah, you know, you throw a little one in there.  But, you know, hey, I worked with him.  He throws it back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wouldn't mess with him.  He can go.  Yeah, Vince can go.  You know, I wrestled him, what was it, a year and a half ago, and I think we went like  40 minutes or something like that.  He's amazing.  He's a tough old guy, man.  Vince, I didn't call you old.  No, yeah, but he can go, man.  He's, you know, and again, he's just like one of us.  He just loves the business, you know? 
[02:57:00]  Right.  So, cool.  Someone wants to ask a question about mankind.  John, what's up?  John.  John, what's up?  What's up?  Turn that down.  I'm asking that question for Triple H.  All right, hurry.  Yeah, I was just wondering, what was it like to wrestle with a one-hour mix bowling if you'd  ever consider doing any of the crazy stuff he does?  Mick.  What was it like wrestling him?  It was great.  Mick's a hell of a guy, and he's a hell of a talent.  You know, and I'm glad that he's happy doing what he's doing.  He's writing books now, and he's retired because physically he was just beat to hell. 
[02:57:30]  And, you know, but, of course, we miss him in the business, you know?  I thought he was a highlight, man.  I loved working with him.  But, I mean, you know, as far as what I do, any of the stuff he did, I mean, hell, he  was the one whacking me in the head with the barbed wire.  So, I mean, yeah.  I thought he had some of the stuff he's done, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, when he picked up the barbed wire around the two-by-four, someone's getting hit with  it.  Yeah.  Like, wow, he's insane.  Look, he's got a two-by-four with barbed wire.  Yeah, but he's hitting somebody with it.  Yeah, he's whacking me with it.  Yeah.  I thought he was great as a commissioner. 
[02:58:00]  I mean, will he come back?  Yeah, I'm sure.  In one of those roles?  Well, I'm sure at some point in time he'll come back and he'll do something, you know.  Is he as fried as they say he is?  I mean, he's taken some serious beatings over the years.  Yeah, he's pretty beat up.  I wouldn't want to wake up a day in his body.  Really?  Yeah, he's pretty messed up.  You know, because how he became, you know, when you look at Mick, you look at a guy that,  like, he's not the best athlete in the world by far.  He doesn't have the greatest physique in the world by far. 
[02:58:30]  A lot of those things.  And so he made up for that by being, you know, the sickest guy by far.  Yeah.  He would do, you know, I mean, he was just killing himself years ago.  You know, all that stuff they show footage of of him being in these exploding...  Rangs.  Yeah, you know, just all these explosions and barbed wire and all this stuff in Japan.  He was doing that for, like, pennies.  You know what I mean?  He was making nothing because he was trying to make a name for himself.  So by the time he got to where he was making big money, he was already beat to hell.  You know what I mean?  Right.  You know, as opposed to the other guys that, you know, saved it for when they got in that position, 
[02:59:00]  they could beat the hell out of themselves for big money.  You know, he kind of did it the other way, and he kind of paid his dues really heavy coming up.  Cool.  Ladies, you seem bored.  You all right?  She needs a spanking.  You need a spanking?  Wait, who needs a spanking?  You want to give her a spanking?  Oh, yeah, come over here.  Can we spank him?  Hey, Mark, come over here.  Come on.  Mark's going to help spank. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  You can take off the T-shirt.  We look a lot more excited.  You can take the...  I don't know.  Take something off.  Hold on, hold on.  Spanking goes over the knee, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And once you take...  You got two knees?  Would you like to...  Wait, take the sweater off, too, I think.  Okay, yeah.  Take off the sweater.  There we go.  All right.  There you go, now.  Wait, get a picture of that.  We don't want to get spank.  You don't want to get spank.  Oh, he's wet in his hand.  He's a pro.  Warming it up.  Oh.  No?  That's nothing? 
[03:00:00]  What are you, insane?  All right, all right.  The other one.  The other one.  Wait.  Nice.  Mark, come over here.  Oh, God.  Mark, give it a shot.  Now, play Babalu.  They just won.  Come on.  That's it?  Mark, that's all you got?  You pat a dog on the head like that.  That's an ass.  You guys give it a shot.  Come on.  Nothing better than girl spanking girls.  He's a girl spanking girl.  Yeah.  There she wet her hand, too.  She's got hand wet. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, that's like a punch.  That was like a scraping.  Ow.  She punched triple A's in the face.  What happened there?  Wait, go ahead.  I like watching.  Nice.  Yeah.  She's going to show up.  Look at that.  It's all red.  Look at her ass.  I love it.  That's got some wiggle on it when you smack it, too.  You like that?  I don't like to be too bold.  That's good.  That's good stuff.  Beautiful blonde.  Look at that.  What a way to end the show, man.  Great job.  You won't forget us, right, Triple H?  No.  This is a great show.  Can I come back tomorrow? 
[03:01:00]  Sure.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  I'm on a sweater now.  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm perfect.  Why aren't you moving?  All right.  Hey, we need to go off with a big bang.  We're getting, like, a mass make-out thing going on.  Hey, you have to now.  Yeah, hey, come on.  Everybody got it.  A little foursome.  How about a make-out?  How about those two will make-out.  She'll get spanked again.  What do you want to do?  Just a touchy-feely make-out thing.  Whatever you want.  Make it look sexy.  Make it like you're doing a porno movie. 
[03:01:30]  What could you do?  Whatever you want.  Oh, wow.  That's a loaded.  That was a long thing to say.  That's a loaded.  Oh, you just got yourself in trouble.  You want to get spanked, too?  Sure.  Sure.  Well, you know, at least they're rough.  Come on.  We'll convince you.  All right.  Let's go for the grand finale here.  Okay.  But there's four of you.  So, like, kind of just so you can all go at it.  That'd be good. 
[03:02:00]  Work it, Hunter.  Work it.  It's not fun for us anymore.  What do you mean it's not fun?  It's not fun.  Hey, she's working.  Your clothes are still on.  Her hands are running to the front over here.  Oh.  Will you look at that?  Wow, the reach around.  Nice.  Nice.  What's she got down there?  Hitler or a...  Hitler mustache, mohawk.  Hitler or yield sign.  Yield sign.  That's a good one.  We're stealing that.  Yield sign.  We're stealing that one.  What's she got?  Get that camel out.  A little Hitler.  You just keep that out. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, all right.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Ah.  I had to shave it for a customer.  I mean, I'm a fever.  A customer?  You had to shave it for a customer?  What do you do?  Wow, look at that.  That is finely groomed.  That is completely groomed.  We call that the jambonet.  Wow, look at that.  You got to play the rest.  Your ass is red.  She wants more, though.  You want more?  Double A.  Give her a good way.  Go ahead. 
[03:03:00]  No.  Someone tells me she doesn't work at Kmart if she had to shave that for a customer.  Is that hard?  No.  Yeah, you know.  Isle 4 needs a shave.  It needs a puke shave.  All right, here we go.  Here's Triple H.  Wait.  Thank you.  Wet the hand again.  Very good.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Jeez.  Hunter just popped her in the face.  Why don't you?  And she's very happy about it.  Wow, you like that? 
[03:03:30]  No.  Hey, this was great, Triple H.  Thank you.  God damn.  We got to thank Triple H.  Very cool.  And thank you.  We got to thank him for the trip to WrestleMania.  Yeah.  This does rock.  We both have cool jobs.  We like your job.  You like ours.  All right.  That was good.  That's a welcome.  Thank you, ladies.  Ladies, thank you very much.  All these ladies' pictures are up on WNAW.com as the qualifying for the Best Ass Contest ends today.  The listeners will start voting on Monday, okay?  Yeah.  All right.

I'll follow you.  Go ahead.  There you go.  See you, too.  Come on, ladies.  Yeah.  They don't even know.  Whoa.  What is it?  Wow.  Wow.  I think she ate half her head.  You left lipstick over her lip there.  She's got lipstick on her chin.  You got something there.  Wow.  Of course.  I don't know if that was hot. 
[03:04:30]  I can't think of it.  That was like...  Seriously, I can tell.  I'm not really sure.  All right, ladies.  Wow.  Thank you very much.  Triple H, thank you very much.  I also want to thank Brian Regan for stopping by today.  We're going to Caroline to see him tonight.  Tonight.  All right.  Any thoughts?  You're done?  Oh, yeah.  I want to plug this access.
