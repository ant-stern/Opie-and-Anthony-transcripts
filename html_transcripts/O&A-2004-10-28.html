<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous celebration of the Boston Red Sox's 2004 World Series victory.  Co-hosts Opie and Anthony, along with in-studio guest Ben Sparks, reveled in the win, while Anthony, a Yankees fan, grudgingly admitted defeat.  The celebratory mood was punctuated by frequent off-topic tangents.  A caller, Earl, a fervent Yankees supporter, initially offered congratulations but quickly devolved into racially charged accusations of foul play against the Red Sox.  Opie and Anthony responded with a barrage of vulgar and sexually explicit jokes targeting Earl’s sex life, fabricating a story about a woman they supposedly set him up with.

Comedian Billy Burr then called in, recounting a Metallica concert and Jim Norton's desperate attempts to get a picture with Lars Ulrich.  The conversation circled back to the Red Sox win, with further racially charged commentary about Boston's demographics. Burr also lamented the high cost of his World Series ticket.  "Stalker Patty," a caller described as a 50-year-old virgin, phoned in with premature congratulations, oblivious to Anthony’s Yankee allegiance. This led to a sustained, graphically detailed, and sexually explicit discussion about Patty's lack of sexual experience, her supposed virginity, and the hosts' attempts to arrange a live gynecological examination for her.  Further calls followed, covering topics ranging from the Red Sox victory to the NHL lockout, interspersed with various humorous anecdotes and continued vulgarity. The segment ended with the hosts fixated on finding a gynecologist for Patty and mocking Earl's fabricated World Series ring.

The next segment focused heavily on "Stalker Patty," with the hosts and callers engaging in sexually explicit and offensive conversations about her lack of sexual experience and speculating about her sexual history with graphic descriptions and vulgar language. Detailed descriptions of sexual acts were discussed, with Patty displaying a lack of sexual knowledge.  A listener called to ask Patty on a date, proposing anal sex.  The show also briefly reviewed the violent and racially charged video game *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas*, mentioned their appearance on John McEnroe's talk show with guests Dee Snider and Andy Richter, and played a comedic Eminem/Paul McCartney mashup.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a profanity-laden attack on competing radio show Don and Mike, boasting about Opie and Anthony's success and citing ratings and search results to support their claims. This was followed by a phone interview with Ted Nugent.  Their conversation covered Nugent's pro-Bush political views, gun control, the Iraq War, and his experiences in Iraq, with Nugent frequently using highly offensive and inflammatory language.  Listeners called in, some supportive, others vehemently critical.  This continued with another segment featuring a studio interview with Ted Nugent.  The conversation touched on US foreign policy, particularly regarding Saudi Arabia, and included a rumor—vehemently denied by Nugent—of him receiving a handjob from a 14-year-old Courtney Love.  The conversation was punctuated with profanity and disparaging remarks. Following the interview, listener feedback criticizing Nugent's views and animal treatment was discussed, followed by a comedic George W. Bush speech remix.  XM Satellite Radio advertisements were interspersed throughout, along with more listener feedback and discussion about their McEnroe show appearance, including details about their termination from a previous network due to the "Sex for Sam" contest.  Audio clips from the McEnroe show were played, leading to further reminiscing about the controversy and their current employment.

The final excerpt focused on their April Fool's Day prank about Boston Mayor Menino's death, highlighting the ensuing fallout, their move to New York City, and their current satellite radio show.  Their catchphrase, "You don't go to CNN for dick jokes," was repeated often.  The hosts discussed their relationship, with Opie suggesting Anthony left him out to dry.  They also promoted their new show, displaying limited knowledge of technical aspects.  A call-in segment followed, along with a phone interview with Sully Erna of Godsmack, who discussed their recent success and tours with Metallica.  Jim Norton was present in the studio.  The segment ended with announcements of future show segments, including "Lesbian for a Day" and an appearance by Bob Kelly, more crude jokes, a song about having one testicle, a joke about people with Down syndrome, and a mention of their "Whiffle Ball Back Challenge."  The show ended abruptly, cutting off Jim Norton mid-sentence.

[00:00:00]  It's the O&A Virus, XM202, XM News, Talk, Sports, and Information.  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:00:30]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:01:00]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:01:30]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:02:00]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:02:30]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:03:00]  It's everything, all the time. 
[00:03:30]  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves.  Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the FCC be able to touch them this time?  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made, no arrests have been made, no arrests have been made, police are still investigating.  Let's do it! 
[00:04:00]  Our society needs borders.  It needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock? 
[00:04:30]  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  People keep your hands off of my meal.  Back to full.  Red Sox fans have longed to hear it.  The Boston Red Sox are world champions.  Turn it off. 
[00:05:00]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  It has been 86 years.  Generations have come and gone.  And for the first time since 1918, the Boston Red Sox are champions of baseball. 
[00:05:30]  A clean sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals.  A dominating effort by the Red Sox in this World Series.  And the Red Sox celebrate in the middle of the diamond here at Bush Stadium.  And that's the big story today.  Great.  Great.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Congrats.  I think I've got to be turned up a little bit.  Remember.  I'm all the way on the end. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, how about that?  Hey, that's better.  Very good.  Very good.  Well, I want to congratulate my Boston Red Sox on a fine World Series victory, Anthony.  Yeah, I'm a big fan.  I've been for years.  I never thought it would happen.  You know, in my lifetime of all the years I've been a Red Sox fan, I've never dreamed of this day, Opie.  Anthony's sporting the Boston Red Sox cap today.  Of course.  Who isn't?  And World Series t-shirt.  You go around New York City, everyone's a Sox fan.  Isn't it wonderful? 
[00:06:30]  Including our own Anthony.  What is that, a Pedro Martinez jersey on the side there?  Got that jersey on?  Sure, sure.  Why not?  Better turn that into a Yankees jersey because he's coming to New York.  I know.  Seems to be the way.  Hey, why not?  Why not?  Well, the curse is over.  Good.  We don't have to hear about the curse anymore.  Everyone in Boston's happy.  Ben's smiling.  As a Yankee fan, you really are happy that the curse is over.  Oh, who cares?  Really?  No, it's funny.  The Boston paper basically says, amen. 
[00:07:00]  I mean, not that this is funny.  Series sweep answers Sox fans' prayers.  But the New York papers, the headline says, the curse takes a year off.  No, I think the curse is over.  Yeah.  I think the curse is over until the Red Sox don't win a World Series for like 50 years.  Yeah.  I don't think it's taking a year off.  I think this does it.  I think this wipes it out.  It pretty much wipes it out.  You know, there are teams out there that haven't won the World Series now in, I don't know,  50, 60 years. 
[00:07:30]  They are now the new cursed team.  Yeah.  Whoever they are, we should find out who the new cursed team is in baseball.  The Cubbies?  You think it's the Cubbies?  Yeah.  That's what you would guess?  I would guess the Cubbies.  So, right around 8.30, I'm watching the game, and Johnny Damon hits that homer.  I'm like, you know what?  I need a good night's sleep.  It's pretty much over.  Just stop it already.  Well, now maybe the Red Sox fans, in all their wisdom, maybe now they can understand. 
[00:08:00]  What would you think, Red Sox fans, if people started chanting?  See, you won the World Series.  World champion Boston Red Sox.  People start chanting, Red Sox suck.  Red Sox suck.  Wouldn't you look and go, well, how could the team?  You look like an idiot because, see, we won the World Series.  We're the champions.  So, if you're chanting, Red Sox sucks, you must be a real idiot. 
[00:08:30]  See, now do you understand how stupid that looks?  You sound a little bitter today.  Bitter?  A little bitter.  I'm so happy for Boston.  It's not about you, douchebag.  I'm very happy for Boston.  It's not about you today.  You and your fine Yankee friends there.  I hope they have a 21 less lethal gun salute in Boston and take out 21 college students' eyeballs.  All right.  Well, the phones are celebrating up there. 
[00:09:00]  The phones are going nuts.  Everybody wants to congratulate our own Ben.  Our own Ben Sparks.  It starts with Black Earl, who's one of the biggest Yankee fans here in New York City.  Oh, here he is.  Hey, Earl.  Hello, brother.  What's up?  I just wanted to congratulate the Red Sox.  Ugh.  Did you ever think you'd have to say that?  I honestly didn't think I'd ever be alive to see that happen.  Why are you congratulating them?  They cheated to beat the Yankees.  They didn't do it fair and square. 
[00:09:30]  A couple of bad calls.  Hey, I mean, you know what?  I mean, now Red Sox fans and Red Sox players in the city of Boston, there's no excuses anymore.  You know what I mean?  No excuses for what, Earl?  Yeah.  For not allowing Blacks to live in most of the neighborhoods?  I mean, what?  What are you talking about?  It's so funny because we've got a list of things that was going on in 1918, the last time the Sox won the World Series. 
[00:10:00]  Well, they have lights when they're – that's one of the – but, no, but, I mean, for years – for the last couple of years, they always said, well, they bought – the Yankees bought championships and this and that.  It's like, but you know what?  Now that they've won a championship, everything changes because their payroll's going to go through the roof.  It's going to be just as high as the Yankees has ever been.  Earl, no one's worrying about next year yet, okay?  No, I understand that.  Everyone knows that Pedro Martinez is going to be a Yankee, but, you know, today is the Red Sox day. 
[00:10:30]  They won the World Series.  You know what?  When the Yankees – when the Red Sox beat the Yankees, I told Ben, I said, hey, you know what?  Whatever.  Congratulations.  Congratulations and enjoy it because the World Series is – it's a great experience if you're a fan.  If you enjoy it, it'll be the greatest week of your life.  You'll probably win the thing.  Earl, you do realize you're not on the Yankees' payroll, right?  No, I'm a –  Oh, my God.  I'm a New Yorker.  He's talking like, you know, that you have firsthand experience about winning a World Series. 
[00:11:00]  No, but –  You're just a fan.  Calm down.  I haven't seen his ring.  I haven't seen Earl's World Series ring.  Earl has a World Series ring.  Earl, where did you get one?  I'm sorry?  You have a World Series ring?  It's a replica.  I put a replica of, you know, Yankee ring.  What – and what?  Do you wear this every single day?  No, I wear it in the – I wear it when the Yankees are in the playoffs.  Oh, you break it out when the Yankees are in the playoffs?  You have your little lucky ring, do you?  I think he really thinks he's part of the Yankees organization. 
[00:11:30]  No, I'm just – I'm just being a fan.  I'm showing a pride as a fan.  He had it resized and stuff, and he was out to dinner with us the other night, and he  was sporting his Yankees World Series replica ring.  That's not why you do it.  You probably try to pick up 18-year-old chicks telling them you're Bobby Bonds.  Bobby Bonds, he's dead.  He looks more like Bobby Bonilla.  Oh, God.  Him – yeah, Bobby Bonds is dead.  But the thing that really wouldn't be realistic about that scenario is Earl trying to pick 
[00:12:00]  up girls.  It's probably true.  Yes, it probably is, Earl.  Earl –  But I'm a fan.  You know what?  I'm a fan, but I'm not one of those psycho fans where –  Earl, let's start a new curse, okay?  Have you been laid since the Yankees won the World Series?  Oh.  I've been laid since – yes, I have.  All right, and what was her name?  I haven't been laid since – I haven't been laid since the Yankees – 
[00:12:30]  Listen to this, guys.  Since 2001.  So you have been laid since the Yankees won the World Series in 2000, right?  Yes.  All right, what's the circumstances of this little exchange?  What's the – I'm not going into that at all.  All right, what did she look like, Earl?  She was hot.  I'm not going to lie.  All right, well, what did she look like?  I don't know.  I went to bed two hours ago.  You don't know what she looked like?  You don't know what she looked like, the last girl you had sex with?  I don't know whether to not believe you or respect you incredibly. 
[00:13:00]  All right, Earl, where did she live?  Honestly, she lived – oh, God, Mount Vernon.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  All right, Mount Vernon.  And where did you meet her?  Actually, through you guys.  You guys set it up.  Hmm.  What?  Yeah.  We set you up with the last leg you had?  Yeah.  We set it up.  Explain.  Was it – I kind of remember a chick, a black chick coming in. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, that was her.  The black chick.  You didn't get laid with that girl.  Oh, yes, I did.  No, you didn't.  I'll swear on a stack of Bibles that I did.  Ben, first I've ever heard of this.  Yeah, because when – I remember the situation.  We brought this girl in to give you lap dances and set you up on a date,  and you, like, kind of wimped out on us.  Hey, there was a whole other backdrop, which – you know me.  I don't tell anybody anything.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, ebony love. 
[00:14:00]  That's right, baby.  Bow, bow, bow, bow.  So, all right, so after the show, you had sex with this girl?  Uh, yeah.  And where did you have sex with this fine young lady?  My apartment.  Among other places.  Yeah, his bachelor pad.  Among other places?  What were some other places, if you don't mind me inquiring?  His imagination was one.  Earl?  Yeah.  You didn't get laid. 
[00:14:30]  No, yes, I did.  No, you didn't.  I'm not going to lie about that.  Earl?  No, I'm not lying.  Opie did say he'd swear on a stack of Bibles,  and that's right up there with pinky promise from a grown man.  All right, Earl.  Uh, we're going to let you go, so you congratulate the Sox fans today, all right?  Yeah, no, absolutely.  I'm like, you know, I'm a gracious enough loser to say that.  Well, you've had a lot of practice.  Can I ask a question? 
[00:15:00]  Earl?  Earl?  Earl?  Yeah.  Was the last person you had sex with Joe Cozzi?  No.  All right, Earl, we're going to let you be.  All right, guys.  Bye, Earl.  Talk to you later.  Sorry I asked you that.  I didn't mean it.  It's very uncomfortable when we talk about Earl and his sexual history,  because we know he doesn't get laid.  Where is she from?  Uh, Mount Vernon?  I know.  I guarantee he's watching the news, and Mount Vernon just flashed across.  Oh, I know. 
[00:15:30]  Lucky it wasn't Baghdad.  Yeah.  Let's say hi.  Where he lived or what he did?  Mount Vernon.  Wow.  Very good.  Let's say hi to Billy Burr.  What's going on, Billy?  Yo, what's up, man?  I know the Sox fans checking in, and a good friend of the show, and a good friend of Jim  Norton's.  We all went to Metallica the other night.  Oh, the Red Sox fans.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I think I'm still drunk, man.  I can't believe it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  But you know what?  I don't give a shit how many World Series they win.  I'll never buy a replica ring. 
[00:16:00]  A replica Red Sox World Series ring.  Yeah, that is right.  I'll get a jersey.  I'll get a hat.  Once you start wearing the ring and start saying you got laid by a black chick, you know,  that's all bullshit.  Yeah, we're not even going to argue with Earl.  We know it's not true.  So, have you slept yet, Billy?  I think I passed out at about 3 in the morning with the window open.  I probably caught the flu.  I don't care, man.  All that Babe Ruth, all that 1918, all that crap is finally over. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah.  The dynasty continues.  You're one in a row.  Yeah, exactly.  Where'd you watch it?  You know what?  I don't care if they don't win another one for the rest of my life.  I don't care.  They won it.  All that stuff is over.  Yeah, they don't ask for a lot in Boston, Anthony.  That's true.  They just wanted the one.  Want the one and keep the black people in their own area.  That's pretty much all Boston wants.  That's all I've heard about.  That's what it is.  It's stay with your own, win one World Series championship, and everything's cool.  Stay with your own. 
[00:17:00]  Keep the Jews and the blacks in their own areas.  That's what Boston is.  I told you that.  It's the most segregated city in America still, man.  Boston is like a racist San Francisco.  Yeah, you got the Jews in Newton.  You got the Irish in Southie.  You got the Italians in the North End.  You got the Swoogies in Roxbury.  Oh, I don't know, because I've never been there.  It's not segregation.  We just call it organized.  Oh, it's a very organized city. 
[00:17:30]  You know where to look for everybody.  If a Jew did something, you know where they are.  Very good.  I never thought of it that way.  You know where to look.  You go to West Roxbury, it's easy.  Yeah, they're smart up there in Boston.  Yeah, that's all it is.  It's not segregation.  It's organization.  If a black guy kills a pregnant woman, you know exactly where to go.  Yeah, you go to Manifest.  Right.  You're not looking around Stoughton.  You know.  God.  And you went to one of the games, right, Billy?  Yeah, I took a mortgage out, and I went to game two. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, I dropped like a grand going into that game.  Cost you about a grand, huh?  Yeah, to sit in center field.  Actually, it cost me $1,300.  I just thought a grand, I'd sound a little less stupid.  Ah, but it was well worth it.  Oh, yeah.  At this point, I still can't believe it.  I'm a part of history.  I still can't believe it.  I think I'm going to go up there and get shot with some pepper spray on Friday.  $1,300 for one ticket, dude?  Yeah.  Jesus.  So far, I haven't won it in 86 years, man. 
[00:18:30]  That's worth it.  So far, the city's pretty controlled.  I think they just showed one of Ben's friends on TV.  They're showing footage of any drunk from Boston looks like Ben's friend and probably is.  Wow, they're showing footage of Boston.  I was saying it looked pretty controlled, but not really, actually.  No, I was kidding.  Oh, they're setting fires.  They're jumping up and down on cars.  Last week.  Oh, that was last week.  That was last week.  I heard it was relatively under control, although I got a text message at 4 in the morning from my  friend, Jesse, that sums it all up. 
[00:19:00]  It just says, in Kenmore Square, getting scary.  There you go.  It's like Fallujah.  They really are one step away from burning a bush effigy, those idiots.  I think the cops tried to send us a message that first day.  You know, they took out that cute little girl.  Right.  Just letting everybody know the pain was coming.  They take out a fan just to scare the rest of us.  Yeah, that's what you got to do.  Just to show them who's boss there.  That's what it was.  It was to show us strength.  All right.  Just to let you know what was coming. 
[00:19:30]  All right, Billy.  Well, congratulations.  Really fast.  How weird was it backstage with Norton trying to get his Lars picture the other day?  Come on.  You got it.  Jim Norton literally became another person.  Yeah.  Jim, I've known him for 10 years.  I've never seen such a look of longing and sheepishness on his face.  Just wanting.  Billy, I said the exact same thing on the radio a few days back.  We're talking about backstage in Metallica.  We had to wait an hour and a half after the show so Norton could get his Lars picture.  And he completely turned into a different person. 
[00:20:00]  Here's a guy that was on Jay Leno.  And he's sitting back there like he's some not worthy kid from the middle of Jersey.  Oh, that's exactly what it was.  And just so happened to get backstage because he snuck through a bunch of security details, you know?  Oh, and he had like the whole technique down.  His I'm not a threat pose.  He's just leaning against the wall with his arms behind his back.  Trying to look all innocent.  Oh, yeah.  Non-threatening.  Yeah, I think he looked like the biggest creep back there.  Exactly what I said. 
[00:20:30]  He definitely looked like he could be a problem when he was trying not to be the problem.  And then...  Yeah, but then he got every photo he wanted.  Oh, I know.  I understand.  He's the master at that.  But we didn't need to wait an hour and a half to wait for this to happen.  And how many times did he check the camera?  Oh, that was the funniest thing.  He had his hand inside his pocket.  It looked like he had a weapon.  Yeah.  Yeah, he kept just pulling out his camera and looking.  He didn't even pull the camera all the way out.  He was like looking to the side and he just kept redoing, what, the zoom or something? 
[00:21:00]  No, when it looked like Lars might be coming out, I would reach in my pocket and turn the camera on.  So when Lars walked over, I would have it on and just take it out and go, hi, camera, right here.  You never want him to wait.  Check, make sure the safety was off of the gun so when Lars came by, I could shoot him in the head.  Lars would literally be like three feet away.  He'd be like, Jim, go up and say what's up.  And he'd be like, no, no, no, it's not good.  It's not good.  It's not good.  I've got to stand here.  I've got to stand here.  I'm going to get kicked out.  Time's not right.  Yeah, it didn't feel right for him.  Yeah, it was every bit of two hours. 
[00:21:30]  And everybody else is just walking through that black curtain, getting their pictures taken.  But not Jim.  He had to wait against the wall for the perfect opportunity, of course.  You've got a technique, man.  You can't mess with the technique.  Absolutely.  You've got to pick your spots.  That's the way it is.  It is proven.  A proven technique because it does seem to work.  Yeah.  But you know what's funny was I made fun of him the whole time.  And then the second I had a chance to get a picture with Lars, I did it.  And he had an unbelievably irritating look on his face.  Oh, yeah.  He really did not look happy in the Billy Burson.  No, really?  Yeah, I have this really geeky, excited look on my face. 
[00:22:00]  And he looks like he's getting, like, audited or something.  It's awful.  All right, Billy.  Well, congratulations.  You're going to have to come in and see us soon, okay?  Absolutely, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  All right.  There goes Billy Burson.  Huge Boston Red Sox fan.  Another guy that hasn't really slept yet today.  Why do we feel compelled to congratulate the Red Sox fans?  Like they did anything.  Well, yeah.  You've got to give us some credit.  You've got to give them some credit.  You're so right, Anthony.  I am right.  You are right.  Why do we feel compelled to congratulate the fans? 
[00:22:30]  Especially the peripheral ones.  Not even the ones that were at Fenway, like, cheering them on.  You make it sound like they're in the dugout and they're a part of this.  Wearing their replica World Series rings.  Yeah, why do we congratulate our friends when their team wins something?  It's for the same reason you congratulate a woman when she gives birth.  It's like, you know, you really technically didn't have much to do with it.  I mean, I know it's her body.  Yeah, you just laid back and did what you're supposed to do.  Yeah, but I don't remember anyone congratulating Yankee fans.  It's just like, hey, you know, Yankees won. 
[00:23:00]  But this way, it's like you feel like congratulating the Bostonians.  Toolbag from New Orleans.  Maybe next time you go out to dinner with Earl, take his World Series ring as a down payment on the check.  Not a bad idea.  Now I know where all his dinner money is going.  It's collateral.  Earl, this thing is a massive freaking ring.  Yeah, I've seen them.  They're big, gaudy rings that only should be worn by people that actually earned them.  And I don't think he just wears them when the Yankees are in the playoffs, by the way.  Believe me, that ass is telling people he's a member of the Yankee organization.  It's like buying a replica Congressional Medal of Honor and walking around with it, you know? 
[00:23:30]  Like anyone's going to buy the fact that you've won that.  Right.  Sean from Dallas.  Earl has a magic Yankee decoder ring.  No wonder he can't get laid.  You know what I like about his ring?  He blows into the top and it goes,  Woo, woo, woo!  Wow, Feather.  That is pretty funny, actually.  Earl's big lips going around it.  Woo, woo!  All right, I pulled it off.  Four of his fingers stuck in his mouth.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station, Anthony.  Does Earl prefer baseball jerseys made of polyester or cotton? 
[00:24:00]  No.  And then in parentheses, I bet he picks cotton.  Oh, we have very racist listeners.  That's awful.  Let's say hi to Stalker Patty.  What's up, Patty?  Hey, how you doing?  Congratulations, Ben.  Congratulations, Anthony.  Why are you congratulating me?  Oh, I knew that the Red Sox were going to win about eight games ago.  Oh, you knew.  You're the one that knew that they were going to go win eight games in a row. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, I knew that.  Yeah, sure you did.  When you watch people like John Damon and people like that, hey, there's no contact.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Did you just call him John Damon like you hang out with him?  Yeah.  No, I mean, just they have a lot of good players.  It's kind of like when the actors go on Leno's couch and have to go, you know, Bobby.  Well, you know, me and Chuck Heston, we were out in Vegas.  That is really awful.  We ran into Bobby De Niro.  Right.  Hey, did you see Dave Ortiz's home run? 
[00:25:00]  Ass.  I saw everybody's home run.  So you're congratulating Ben?  Yes, and congratulations to Anthony, too.  I don't need congratulations.  I'm a Yankee fan, you dolt.  Why are you congratulating Anthony?  I'm a Yankee fan.  Well, you said you were a Red Sox fan.  Make up your mind.  Make up my mind.  I'm being chastised by a freak.  How long have you been listening to our radio show?  Years.  At least six to seven years? 
[00:25:30]  Since 1999.  1999.  1999.  Don't you know by now that Anthony's a hardcore Yankee fan?  Oh, I know.  That's the only sport he follows is Yankee baseball.  So when he says that he's now a Boston Red Sox fan, don't you think he's kind of goofing?  Well, I like more than one band at once.  You know, it's not all you two.  How would you like to make her nose look like Schilling's ankle?  Just dripping blood? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  You're a mess.  Hey, Patty, so when are we going to get your twat checked?  I don't know.  When are we?  Well, we put the word out there for a gynecologist to do some charity work, and not one gynecologist  has come forward to check out your twat.  Last time she had a gyno checkup?  The Red Sox won the World Series.  Last time.  1918.  Yeah, when was the last?  Hold on.  You know, we're going to do this whole 1918 thing.  Of course we are.  But we could do a little side thing as well.  Stalker Patty, when was the last time, considering you're going to be 50 years old soon, when was 
[00:26:30]  the last time you had your twat checked?  It was very soon.  I can wait.  Shut up.  Shut up.  When was the last time you had your twat checked?  About 15, 20 years ago.  Oh my God.  What a dry spell.  Do you want to call it 20 years ago?  Is that accurate?  Were you about 30, 29 years old?  Basically, yeah.  And I practically ran out of there.  Of course.  All right.  So about 1984, it doesn't go back any later?  No.  All right.  Because this 1918 thing, everybody's going to do today. 
[00:27:00]  But I think it would be funny to see what was going on in 1984 when Stalker Patty last  had her twat checked.  Last had a gynecological exam.  Someone get the timeline for 1984.  1984, we've got to find out what was going on in the world when that snatch of yours  was pried open and looked into.  I'm waiting.  Did they put in that speculum, Patty?  Did they get to that point where they actually put in the metal thing that opened you up?  Yes, they did. 
[00:27:30]  That was the part that made me run.  And then a couple years later, I brought it up to somebody and they said, oh, he must  have used something that was too big.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  Yeah.  A credit card is too big for your twat.  Hey, Patty, when it opened up, did it sound like, did it make the same noise a fruit roll-up  makes when you pull it off?  No.  I know.  I think I'm probably the only person my age that's never been laid unless you're a nun  or something.  What's harder to open up, your twat or a black girl's wallet? 
[00:28:00]  Ooh.  Probably black girl's wallet.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we've got to get you in here so we can check out what's going on in there.  1984.  Well, my eyeballs are popping out, so I'm going to go back to bed.  Oh, you too, Dad.  Do you have work today, Patty?  Yeah, I've got to open.  She's got to open.  She works at Gedeva Chuklin.  I have a key holder, so I've got to open the store. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, a key holder.  Wow.  How about that?  You're the key master.  Oh, no.  I'm a key holder.  Whatever.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  We're going to put the word out again.  We need a gyno in the New York area that's willing to do some charity work.  We'll take care of you somehow.  And we want you to examine Patty live on the show here in the studio.  Give her a little pap smear.  She hasn't had her twat check since 1984.  Oof.  1984.  And you don't even have to prove you're a gynecologist. 
[00:29:00]  Just show up and we'll believe you.  Right.  Yeah, if you're some creepy guy that just happens to have the tools of the trade, that'll work just fine.  Have some rubber gloves.  Right.  We don't care.  The guy just gets some rubber gloves and starts digging in.  All we know is it'll make for great radio, so get your tools and come on in.  Those big yellow gloves like janitors clean out the toilet with?  Yeah.  Yeah, big, thick dishwashing gloves.  All right, spread them, honey.  Maybe we should call me into the world records.  What?  Maybe we should call me into Guinness World Records. 
[00:29:30]  Well, Guinness?  Hey, Patty, do we have your phone number?  Because we're going to call you back.  I'll put her on hold.  Wait, can I ask Patty a question?  Yeah, yeah.  Who do you want to call it into?  The Guinness World of World Records or whatever they call it.  The Guinness World of World Records.  The Guinness World of World Records.  You know what I mean.  Do you like drinking Guinness Bass Ale, do you?  I like Guinness.  I love a nice, cold Guinness.  Yeah.  You're a real Guinness, I got to tell you.  Do you like Alec Guinness from Star Wars? 
[00:30:00]  I don't know.  And she's never had a penis inside of her.  Yeah, you don't like the penis?  Nah, it's not bad.  I guess we lack of money.  Guinness?  What the hell is the Guinness?  What the hell is the Guinness?  The Guinness World of World Records.  Patty.  Yeah?  It's pronounced Guinness.  Guinness.  That's what I said.  Right.  Yes, that's exactly what you said, only it sounded like Guinness.  Oh, sorry.  Did we get the 1984 thing? 
[00:30:30]  All right.  All right.  So, should we just call her back?  Yeah.  All right.  Patty, hold on a second, because we're going to go back to you when we find out what was  going on in the world in 1984 when your twat was last checked.  There goes Starker Patty.  Oh.  All right.  Let's take a couple more calls here.  Say hi to Jeremy in Jersey.  Hey, Jeremy.  How you guys doing this morning?  All right, man.  Got it.  Patty's the key master.  God help a gatekeeper.  Yeah, I know.  I was just calling to say, you know, you were talking about congratulating the Red Sox  fans. 
[00:31:00]  It's kind of like when you have a cancer patient, and they didn't really lose all their hair  after their chemo, and you just got to kind of give them a little boost.  You're like, hey, you look great.  You're doing good, man.  You're hanging in there.  Not really, dude.  I mean, you got to give it to them.  They won it this year.  No, no.  That's true.  I think cancer patients survive.  I mean, will they win it next year?  Absolutely not.  Because they're going to lose a lot of their players.  Know who's the most bummed person in America today?  Nomar Garciaparra.  Or Nomar. 
[00:31:30]  Nomar Garciaparra.  He was supposed to bring them many titles, and the year he leaves, they win it.  That's it.  All right, boys.  I'm going to punch you out.  Talk to you later.  The Eddie Westfall of baseball.  Earl has a World Series ring.  And Nomar does not.  Let's say hi to Tim in Jersey.  A lot of Jersey calls today.  Hey, Tim.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Looks like they're advertising us in Jersey.  Everyone getting their XM satellite radios in Jersey.  All right, Tim.  I just wanted to say, you were talking about taking the pictures before. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And I saw little Jimmy Norton at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  Ooh.  And I wanted a picture with him, but I didn't have a camera, and I was really drunk.  So I walked to a gas station on camera, and when I came back, he was eating dinner with  a bunch of guys.  And Jimmy, he takes pictures with everybody.  So I actually bothered him during his dinner, and he took a picture with me.  So thanks a little, Jimmy.  You're very welcome, sir.  And thanks for that story.  I'm sure people right now are bolting out of their beds trying to catch the made-for-TV  movie called The Ass Gets a Photo with Jimmy Shoving Food to His Fat Face. 
[00:32:30]  Compelling.  I was with him the whole way.  I'm a part of that story, and I hated it.  I liked how the story took that weird turn.  Like, where's my camera?  Oh, my God.  I got to go to the...  You forgot to mention what gas station you went to.  Now people will never get back to sleep.  There was adventure, intrigue.  I can't wait for the sequel.  Yeah.  Gets an autograph during dessert.  I laughed when he didn't have the camera. 
[00:33:00]  I cried when he got the picture.  Yeah, and then you're like, what is Jimmy going to say?  Right.  Will he say yes?  Will he say no?  And what is Jimmy eating?  You left a lot of stuff out that people really were interested in.  That's good.  It's like a teaser for the actual motion picture.  Let's say hi to Jim in Brooklyn.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Everyone sounds a little tired today.  Everyone was up watching the goddamn baseball game.  Yeah, for some reason I had to stay up and watch that disaster area.  Oh, you're talking about our appearance on the John McEnroe show?  No, actually, for some stupid reason, you know, something about watching McEnroe doesn't appeal to me. 
[00:33:30]  All right.  You and everyone else, apparently.  Listen, seriously, you guys can't do this with Patty.  I think it would be great radio to have somebody get a gynecological appointment on the air,  but just the thought of Patty naked is a scary thing.  You're not digging on that, huh?  No, just the idea.  How bad does your twat have to be that a radio listener doesn't want to hear us talking about her twat  as it's getting checked out for the first time in 20 years? 
[00:34:00]  Let's put it this way.  I was at the last softball game that you guys had, which you guys should do again.  Yeah, we will.  We've got to build up the show a little bit, but then we're going to bring all that stuff back.  But, you know, Patty wowed people at that game.  And most people, when she was wowing, almost vomited.  Yeah.  You know, it was a disgusting thought.  The fact that she has those parts are disgusting.  But she's a virgin.  Yeah, she's a ha.  And that reminds me.  She's a ha.  No.  You can't use hot. 
[00:34:30]  There's no way you can use that word.  Now, you know that it sounds like you've been listening to us for a while, Jim.  You know we like to punish you guys from time to time.  That's exactly what you'd be doing.  The first punishment is on the way.  You guys will have to listen as we get a gyno to check out Stalker Patty's twat.  Well, I kind of feel bad for you guys having to be in the studio and watch it.  We force you to listen to that.  Yes, we force you.  That's one of those times that, you know, how you talk about, you know, people can change the station?  Yeah.  That's one of those times I think I'll be changing the station. 
[00:35:00]  I don't think so.  That's the best part of this radio show.  When we tell you to listen and force you to listen to something, you guys listen.  So, all right, Jim, thank you.  All right, have a good one, guys.  You want a little quickie of 1984?  Maybe a thing that happened?  Well, I was hoping some of the people that work behind the scenes would have got it for us.  Our listeners have come forward.  All right.  So, 1984 was the last time that Stalker Patty had her twat checked.  What was going on in the world in 1984, Anthony?  Opie, on January 28th, 1984, Michael Jackson's hair caught fire during the shooting of the Pepsi commercial. 
[00:35:30]  Remember that one?  Oh, yeah.  That was 1984.  That was the last time she stepped into a gyno office.  Okay.  How about Vanessa Williams becomes the first African-American Miss America?  1984.  1984.  And there's Patty laid out on the table, metal device being put in her as she runs away in fear.  Fear for her vagina.  Opie, look at all the computing equipment around us.  Would you just look at it?  I see it all. 
[00:36:00]  It's all over the place.  You can't really do anything without a computer these days.  Everyone has one.  I even have to answer phones with the computer.  1984.  Apple computer releases the Macintosh personal computer.  And there she was getting a personal vaginal exam.  1984.  Chemical disaster in Bhopal, India from Union Carbide killing a bunch of Indians.  Remember that one?  And Geraldine Ferrara.  Yeah, they just made more.  Geraldine Ferrara becomes the first woman vice presidential candidate. 
[00:36:30]  That went well.  Yeah.  Went almost as well as Patty's gynecological exam.  It went so well that we haven't had one since, I don't think, right?  No.  I think Aaron Mondale lost 49 to 1 in states.  People realize after that, just let's stick to your basic white guy candidates.  Basic two white guys.  Your two white guy candidates.  We're really not ready for anything else in this country.  I don't know if we ever will be.  Do you get a black president or a woman's president first?  I say a...  It's really up in the air.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:37:00]  I don't have an answer for that.  I think we...  Black conservative.  I think we get a black president first, but he's a light-skinned black to make it a little  easier for people.  Do you think white people are less prejudiced against light-skinned black people than dark-skinned  black people?  Hell yeah.  You can turn down your tint on the TV and not notice something.  Dude, hell yeah.  We have a lot of black listeners, we did this bit once, and they even say that the people  that are a little lighter than themselves, they have prejudice against them.  I know there's a black prejudice, like a lighter-skinned black person is prejudiced against darker-skinned 
[00:37:30]  black people.  But is white people...  Is there a difference with white people?  Because I just thought white people were just prejudiced like a blanket, you know, a blanket  prejudice.  It goes down a little easier.  Is that it?  Just a little easier.  So you're thinking like a Colin Powell-type black guy is a little easier to handle than  someone as dark as like Mickey Rivers. 
[00:38:00]  Ah.  Could have come up with a much better example.  I'm sorry, Anthony, but that was the only black person I could think of.  David Ortiz?  Really.  David Ortiz...  He's pretty black.  He's pretty black, but they get a lot blacker.  Really?  Yes.  You're talking to Shine.  It's like, really?  We're talking like Bernie Williams black.  Well, no.  No, no.  I mean, he isn't all that black.  Oh, my God.  The comedian.  Bernie Mac.  Bernie Mac.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Bernie Mac black.  That's what I'm thinking.  Imagine if he was president.  No. 
[00:38:30]  But Colin Powell...  But I bet it would be a funny movie.  Just put it in your head, though.  Bernie Mac is president.  Oh, Lord!  I'm in the White House.  Oh, the house is white!  Yeah.  Or Colin Powell black.  See, it just kind of goes down a little easier.  Just speaking the truth, I'm sorry.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  I don't think our country will be ready for that for quite some time.  I think it will happen with a vice president.  It'll be a Republican. 
[00:39:00]  It'll be a conservative.  Oh, you think they'll throw that in as like a...  I just think that if the first black guy to get elected,  it'll probably be through a vice presidential nomination.  It'll probably be a more conservative candidate.  First black president?  Obama.  Oh, no.  Obama.  Barack Obama has a shot as a Democrat.  He's very well-liked.  Obama.  All right.  Screw that.  Let's go back to the phones and say hi to Max and Dalton.  That was good in the middle of a comedy show that I actually said,  Barack Obama's very liked.  Like, very liked.  And wondered why.  Everybody just kind of looked at me like,  shut your fat face, stupid.  We know.  What's going on, guys? 
[00:39:30]  Hey, why are you guys giving us this day in history in 1985?  What's going on here?  I don't know.  History from the 80s.  Events of 1984.  But then it says...  Okay, all right, all right.  Go ahead, Max.  I got a question for you guys.  You guys are talking about checking out Patty's squat and whatever.  Yeah.  How about, like, if people sent pictures in to you of women that are uglier than Patty?  Because my wife's best friend, she had that stomach stapling thing.  Yeah.  And she's like 6'2", and she probably weighs 100 pounds, dripping wet, and all that fucking 
[00:40:00]  loose skin is hanging down.  And about a month ago, we went over to her house to visit, and I accidentally walked in  while she was getting out of the shower.  I had to literally go fucking puke in the other bathroom.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, my God.  It's not that Patty...  I mean, there are plenty of women that are more disgusting than Patty, that's for sure.  It's the whole Patty package.  It's the fact that she's a 50-year-old virgin, the fact that she's just a little mousy thing. 
[00:40:30]  So is this woman.  She's 52.  Patty started her life on a diner's counter in a little basket.  She was what they call a foundling.  A foundling.  They actually...  Yeah, Anthony's right.  It's the whole package.  The whole package is pathetic.  She hasn't had her twat checks since 1984.  Can this guy hear me, by the way?  Can you hear Anthony?  Yeah, I can hear both of you.  Oh, I'm just amazed, because he just talks over everything anybody on this show says. 
[00:41:00]  We've got to say goodbye to Max.  He's not playing by the rules today.  But for a second, it was a technical glitch again, and perhaps my phone wasn't...  But no.  It's a glitch in his brain.  You know what the problem is?  We still don't have a gynecologist coming forward to check Patty's twat out, Anthony.  Why wouldn't a gyno want to help out?  Here's some more of the events of 1984, the last time Stalker Patty had her twat checked.  Uh-huh.  Marvin Gaye was killed.  Oh, yeah?  Seems like just yesterday.  Soviets boycott the L.A. Summer Olympics. 
[00:41:30]  Mm-hmm.  That was a long effing time ago.  How about this?  McDonald's massacre.  After telling his wife he was going hunting for humans, James...  What was his last name?  Huberti?  Huberti?  Huberti.  Right?  Shoots 40 people at a McDonald's in California.  Shoots 40 people?  Wow.  He kills 21 people before he was shot to death by police.  Outstanding!  That book!  Sponsor building, sir!  He was a Marine!  Gandhi was assassinated back in 1984, Anthony. 
[00:42:00]  Ooh.  Uh, Band-Aid was the big concert.  Do they know it's Christmas?  Do they know it's Christmas to raise money for famine relief?  Yes, that was 1984.  They're trying to get a new one of those together?  Bob Geldof is trying to get a new one together?  Just, could you move on?  They're calling it, what, do they know it's Kwanzaa?  And, uh, surgeons implant baboon heart into baby fae.  Oh, I remember that one.  And finally, back in 1984, the last time Stalker Patty had her twat checked, good old Bernard 
[00:42:30]  Getz opens fire.  Oh, Bernie Getz!  Good old Bernard Getz.  Yeah, he didn't like how some undesirables were looking at him on the subway and decide  to just open fire.  That was Grand Theft Auto 1, the original, man.  He's on a subway, black eyes walk up to him, ask him for some change, but he did notice  the sharpened screwdrivers in their pockets and, uh, the look, he said, in their eyes. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, they saw the look.  They looked a little shifty.  And so he pulled out an unregistered handgun and shot him.  Shot him all.  And, uh, one of them is lying on the ground and he goes, you don't look too bad.  And he pumped a few more into him.  Darryl Kaby.  Just a complete psychopath.  That's Grand Theft Auto.  Gotta love it.  Alright, we're gonna start.  Can I say something about Bernhard Getz?  Yeah, go ahead.  Because I love him.  Yeah, we'll wait until, while you eat.  I'm sorry, I realized I had a mouthful of Pop-Tart and coffee, you know, the whole breakfast 
[00:43:30]  experience.  Ha ha.  Um, oh, I really am an asshole.  He, was so.  You swallowed Jesus.  I know, I know.  I'm sorry.  He was, he was, when they were, Ron Cooby and them, you know what, can you just go to  break?  I can't get my thoughts together.  Oh, no.  Did we throw you off?  No, I threw me off.  We were, we were kind of nodding and going, I know it's coming.  I know it's coming out.  Come on.  They were suing Bernhard Getz.  It was a civil suit.  Darryl Kaby is the guy who he said, you don't look bad enough.  Yeah.  Uh, and he's paralyzed below the waist. 
[00:44:00]  Good for him.  As he should be.  Yeah.  He should be.  Although, unfortunately, it's not below the neck, because now he can still function somewhat.  Um, and Ron Cooby was his attorney and they're prosecuting and Cooby's got, uh, Bernhard  Getz on the stand and he's like, do you know that Darryl Kaby had dreams and all these questions?  And, uh, and Bernhard Getz goes, you know, sir, you don't think of the dreams and aspirations  of a man when he's assaulting you.  And as I'm telling, as I'm telling this story, let me explain to you guys what just happened  here.  Yes, Jim. 
[00:44:30]  I realized I forgot the exact quote.  So I just paraphrased.  Did you paraphrase?  At the end.  That was probably, maybe I should tell a story, but I was sitting there having dinner one time  and some guy came over.  Oh my God.  And he wanted a photograph taken.  Yeah.  And he had a little bit of a camera that he had gotten from us.  Jimmy, that could have been the worst story you've ever told.  I realized, it's a very funny quote, but I realized that anything that might resemble  humor was not showing up.  Just was not showing up in that conversation.  Get us the hell out of here. 
[00:45:00]  Punch out Maverick.  We'll return.  Go, go, go.  It's time to find America's Sexy State.  You're in the lead.  It's Illinois.  At that point, the thighs close down on your ears. 
[00:45:30]  And you feel like you're diving at about 300 feet.  Hey, let's hear it for Karen.  Illinois, once again.  Sexy State in America.  Defending their title.  Think you can beat them?  Call O.B. and Anthony at 866-WOW-1-WOW.  And give it your best shot. 
[00:46:00]  So I had to take a Greyhound bus recently.  Anyone done that?  Been to a Greyhound station?  Oh, it's terrible, isn't it?  It's just a bunch of people who don't have a car.  Or a friend with a car.  There's always a woman with a black eye and a baby.  Scouts from the Springer show are there looking for talent.  So I had my laptop on the Greyhound, which has apparently never happened before.  How's that thing work? 
[00:46:30]  There's no plug or nothing.  Don't worry, man.  It runs out of ignorance.  You sit right there.  Oh, yes.  I'm getting a power surge.  The bus is sad, man.  I'm surprised I didn't see a couple try to sneak into the bathroom and join the 8-foot-high club.  Very different than a plane.  You know, on a plane you have that constant underlying fear of death.  Whereas on Greyhound, it's really more of a longing for death to come quickly. 
[00:47:00]  It just takes forever.  And they have the gall to name it after a racing dog.  This bus should be called Crippled Poodle.  Chihuahua with rickets.  That would have been a much better name.  This dog needs more calcium.  So I mentioned the Springer show, man.  I keep watching that crap.  In every show they set up a fight.  Let me understand this, sir. 
[00:47:30]  A guy broke into your house.  You beat up your wife.  Kidnapped both your kids.  You never found out what happened to them.  That is terrible.  Well, let's bring him out.  It's not right.  If you're afraid of terrorism, the way to go is by bus.  Have you ever been to a bus station?  It's freaky, huh?  People walking around dirty, filthy, wearing rags, babbling, shaking.  No terrorist will take out a bus station.  They get down, they look around, they're like,  Damn, someone's already done this, bitch. 
[00:48:00]  I'm sitting in the bus station, minding my own business, reading Ta-Da Magazine.  A magazine by and for gay magicians.  But that's another story.  A guy comes up to me.  He's only got one tooth.  Just one.  And he's not even taking good care of it.  You figure when you're down to your last tooth, it's your baby in a bit.  Not this fucker. 
[00:48:30]  He's like, Hey, man, can I help you?  I'm like, help me do what?  Remember to brush and floss regularly?  Or give a prison blowjob?  What?  He's like, No, man, I thought you needed directions.  Hey, you know, if I need directions, I'm not asking a man with one tooth.  I'm asking a man with one leg.  Because he definitely knows the easiest way to get there.  Yup, if there's a shortcut, that one-legged fucker knows where it is. 
[00:49:00]  You won't be hopping fences, neither.  I'm sorry, but I love a one-legged man.  That is a good look.  So manly.  Down and you'd have him.  He always looks like he's come a long way to tell you something really important.  Come over here.  Listen.  Listen.  It's slippery outside.  Trust me, I only got one leg.  Now turn me. 
[00:49:30]  East.  That guy's got information.  You see a guy with one tooth, what does he know?  Nothing.  Taffy is delicious.  I love taffy.  Hey, can you help me start this apple?  Come on, help me out.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony. 
[00:50:00]  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn him off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By pure Macy Gray's awful version of this on that iPod commercial. 
[00:50:30]  The what?  I'm sorry.  I was turning down my headphones.  You know Macy Gray singing this song?  On that horrible, horrible commercial she does?  There you go.  Sorry, I was distracted.  What were you saying?  Macy Gray.  I had to change my headphones.  Oh, there's a bad version of this with Macy Gray on the iPod commercial.  Okay, I'm with you now.  Awful.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Yes?  So, Bernhard Gantz goes, it's very rare that a victim thinks of the aspirations of his assailant.  That's how it went.  Do you want to just go home?  Are you all right?  I feel very tired today.  Yeah?  I woke up.  Yeah, I've been sleeping well.  Four hours a night, maybe.  Me too.  I, God, this morning stuff.  Yeah, but you stayed up.  I was so good in afternoon.  But now baseball's over. 
[00:51:30]  Baseball's over.  It wasn't even a baseball.  I sure wasn't staying up to watch the thrilling St. Louis Cardinals.  Yeah, they really, they really, they really did nothing.  At least the Yankees spanked the Red Sox before they completely collapsed.  St. Louis just went in there and just stunk up the joint.  Yeah, everybody knows the Yankees lost on a fluke and that it really was a couple bad calls.  Everybody knows that, but the Cardinals.  And you know what?  What, Opie?  No one's going to remember any of that crap. 
[00:52:00]  Uh-huh.  It was, you guys are sore losers today.  No, we're not.  Not at all.  Hey, look, I'm happy for the fact that.  My Boston Red Sox.  Your Boston Red Sox.  I would love to make some of the cash that's coming in off of Sox hats.  Yeah.  Those goddamn Boston hats because everyone's wearing them.  With the two little red stockings feet on them.  There you go.  You're wearing red socks today to celebrate.  Oh, you know, we've got to get back to this 1984 thing really fast, Anthony, because there's 
[00:52:30]  a couple things that are on here.  Did you just fart?  No.  Did you hear it?  Oh, my God.  Didn't you hear it?  Could you bring that over here because I need to spray my mic now because I have to smell  something.  New rule on the Opie and Anthony show.  If you're going to fart, fart into the mic so everybody can enjoy it, okay?  That's fair.  See, why don't we designate a farting mic?  Can I borrow yours?  We're short one microphone today. 
[00:53:00]  That's going to happen in some wacky other planet world.  Let's designate a farting microphone from now on, okay?  Oh, here they are.  The live footage of the Red Sox returning to Boston after winning the World Series last  night.  A lot of people that obviously don't have to go to work today are on the tarmac as the  Red Sox D-plane.  Couldn't the pilot crank over that engine and watch a bunch of fans get sucked right in?  I don't know how happy that would make me.  Oh, my God.  Now it smells like Lysol and rotting ass. 
[00:53:30]  No.  Anyway, Anthony.  Smells good now.  What smells worse?  Norton's rotting ass or Stalker Patty's twat because it hasn't been checked in 20 years.  Hasn't seen any daylight.  Right?  It's like an old cave.  Still waiting for that gynecologist to step forward and it's just not happening.  We got to get this going on for the radio show.  It's for her own safety.  Of course.  There could be some kind of things growing in there.  So she hasn't had a twat check since 1984.  A couple more things that were going on in the world in 1984. 
[00:54:00]  Jenna Rosso from Whackbag has to remind me.  1984, the first year of the end of the Islander dynasty.  Yes, that's true.  Oh, remember that when the Islanders had that nice run?  I remember every time I have to go to an Islander-Ranger game, which isn't going to happen for at least two years, by the way.  Yeah, what happened?  Hockey's so done.  I don't even know the circumstances behind that.  What is going on?  I honestly don't even know what a lockout is.  And I know that sounds really ignorant.  I don't know what a lockout is.  I have no idea why hockey isn't going to be played. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know.  Opie, what's happening?  I don't know.  An owner-player problem?  Yeah, exactly.  Is that what it is?  And each side doesn't want to budge?  Exactly, yeah.  But why for two years?  Why can't they just settle this?  No, because they're already talking about we should get some kind of stupid sports expert,  but then that'll bore everybody.  So this is my version.  Next year, they're going to use replacement players.  Oh, that's great.  They're already talking about replacement players for next year, not even this year.  This year is completely done.  XFL's version of hockey. 
[00:55:00]  It's pretty much what it's going to be.  Second-rate players.  Yeah, they haven't officially canceled the season, but if they get a bunch of goons to  fight, that might be fun to watch.  That could be kind of cool, you know?  I am so happy, too, because I hate hockey.  You don't?  Yeah, I've always hated it.  When it's on sports radio, it's all I talk about is the stupid Rangers, and I just don't  want to hear it.  So anyway, every time I go to the Ranger-Islander game, I have to hear 1984.  Yeah.  We used to chant the whole 1940, and that's over, and now the whole 1918 chant is over. 
[00:55:30]  So yeah, that's another thing that happened in 1984, and a couple more really fast.  Madonna's first song, Holiday, she sings that on American Bandstand.  That was the last time Stalker Patty had her twat checked.  And the good old Reverend Jesse Jackson, he doesn't want people to remember this, but  yes, back in 1984, Anthony.  He acknowledges that he called New York City, Hymeetown.  Hymeetown.  That is back in 1984, yes. 
[00:56:00]  Hymeetown.  And he got away with that.  In 84, Howard Cassell retires from Monday Night Football.  Oh my gosh, he's got to get this thing checked out.  Oh my.  Howard Cassell has been dead for, I think, 15 years.  And coincidentally, it looks like Howard Cassell's wig down there between our legs.  And Anthony?  Look at that vagina.  Back in this day, on December 30th, 1984, Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen still had two arms.  Oh. 
[00:56:30]  It was the next day, December 31st, that he lost his arm in a car car.  That was 20 years ago that he got...  20 years ago, he lost his arm.  It hasn't grown back.  No, not at all.  Amazing.  A little surfing drummer.  So there you have it.  He still plays, though, right?  Oh, of course.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Sure he does.  Oh, of course.  Sometimes you just got to say, look, dude, no offense, but we got to replace you.  We'll still give you royalties on the things you did, but...  They were pretty good sports about the drummer losing an arm.  Yeah, they really are good friends.  Figured the whole thing out. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, I would love to see what the gynecologist comes up with looking in there.  Yeah.  And just to see her reaction, because, you know, she's so prudish.  She is the school marm from Little House on the Prairie type of woman.  Virgin at 50.  And just to see her squirming, uncomfortable, little tear rolled down her cheek,  because it reminds her of some past assault that you know happened to her.  And that religious family she was raised in, she was raised in some kind of wacky, 
[00:57:30]  religious, hardcore religious family.  Well, her life didn't start like that.  Her dad was a stockbroker that was banging some stripper on the side.  They had Stalker Patty.  The stripper gets pregnant and has Patty.  And then the stripper goes back to the stockbroker and goes, hey, I'm pregnant with your kid.  And the stockbroker's like, well, have fun.  Who cares?  That's your problem.  Yeah.  So then the stripper was like, I can't be a mom, so put little Stalker Patty in a basket.  This is how I remember her story.  On a basket.  And left her on a counter in a diner. 
[00:58:00]  In a diner.  And that day, Stalker Patty officially became a foundling.  She was then taken to what they called the Foundling Center.  It's like, what is this, 1930?  It's like she was, it's like an Our Gang episode.  The Little Rascals.  Oliver Twist.  So then from that point, she, please, may I have some, so at that point, she went into  a religious family?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got adopted or taken in like a foster home by some religious fanatics that were so 
[00:58:30]  ultra religious.  Forget about it.  Your body is filthy.  Anything that comes out of it or goes into it is filthy.  You're filthy.  Sex is filthy.  And she was raised this way.  And so she's got all these wacky ideas about sex.  Patty?  Yes.  Oh, there she is.  We were just describing you.  I had to go walk across the room and turn my radio down.  You were just describing how insane you are about sex because of your religious upbringing. 
[00:59:00]  Well, I have a, I believe emotionally I have a healthy attitude towards it.  I guess now.  You do not.  You haven't had it.  How do you have a healthy emotional?  Well, I need a boyfriend first.  No, at this point you just need a good banging.  Give up on the stupid boyfriend thing and just go out and get laid.  I want to be careful I don't get any diseases in the process.  I think you've been ultra careful and at this point don't worry about it. 
[00:59:30]  Can I stress how funny that would be if you had sex with one guy?  Oh, my God, and got AIDS.  Or the herp or just something awful.  Something awful and incurable.  That would just be fantastic.  That would be happening.  I got the hib.  Like the guy knew he had it and cut a hole in his own rubber, just the teacher who was boss.  Well, I'm feeling good.  I'm taking my AZT.  Wouldn't that be fantastic?  Well, I do believe in protection.  Well, protection. 
[01:00:00]  You're pretty protected not having sex in 50 years.  What?  You figure she's probably 35 years of dating age and nothing?  Well, you know what happened?  When I was in my 20s and 30s, I was literally a workaholic and was kind of like a loner and decided to work hard.  Man, did that get you somewhere in life.  Usually when you're a workaholic, you're living in Jersey in a mansion at this point, getting jetted around by a chauffeur or something.  She has nothing to show for her hard work. 
[01:00:30]  No, not really.  No.  Not at minimum wage.  You ever kiss a guy?  Well, yeah.  When I've gone on some, like I've had a little dating or something where I've gone out once or twice with friends.  Was it actually, let me ask you honestly, was it a date?  Was that when you were living in Mount Vernon?  Sorry, Jay.  That's funny.  Very funny.  Yeah, I know.  That's why we're on the radio.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  So what were these dates like?  You would go out alone or you said with friends? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, eating, you know, or...  Eating, drinking, fucking, soft game.  And I'm on a bowling league on Friday, so I'm getting to meet people there.  Oh, you meet a fine caliber of person in the bowling league.  So you're in a bowling league.  Yeah.  Do you realize that your bowling ball's been fingered more than your twat?  That's right.  That frail little arm trying to fling that ball down the alley.  That clit of yours is just begging for a tickle. 
[01:01:30]  It's just begging.  I bet you that she actually broke her hymen on the bowling lanes, like stretching down  after a roll, and you heard like a little rip and a tear fell down and blood-stained jeans.  No, no, no.  I think I'm very firm for my age.  I think I'm very lucky.  Because I see other women my age.  I compare myself to them.  I think I'm very, very lucky.  Really?  I think I have good DNA.  Patty, obviously you don't own a mirror.  I do.  She actually said she has good DNA. 
[01:02:00]  I feel very lucky.  Patty, Paris Hilton has good DNA.  Jessica Simpson has good DNA.  She feels lucky in that Lou Gehrig kind of way.  It's people like you that proves that God has a sense of humor.  Do you understand that?  Yeah, but Paris Hilton doesn't have two brain cells to rub together.  It's just an IQ of 10.  She's a millionaire.  What's the problem?  You're hawking chocolate.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, she's a millionaire because of her parents, not because of anything she did herself. 
[01:02:30]  She doesn't work.  Well, they left her on the counter of a fine restaurant.  That was the difference.  Yeah, it was a better restaurant than the one I was watching.  Patty, you go out on these dates.  Yes.  And you kiss goodnight?  Is it a...  Yeah, just a simple goodnight.  Is it a peck kind of kiss?  Basically, yeah.  So you have never had what they call the French kiss, the open mouth kiss with a guy?  No, I don't think I want to...  That's disgusting.  Like, what...  See, see, this is what we're talking about. 
[01:03:00]  This is what we're talking about.  That you have no idea.  You have no idea about sex or relationships between men and women.  Well, I know when I read in books, I am informed, you know.  No, it's not something you can read in a book.  It's something you have to live in life, and you haven't done it.  You're very uptight, and it comes from your upbringing and that religious cult you grew up in.  Yeah, well, I'm trying to shake that now.  Trying to shake it.  You should be shaking something else for the past 35 years. 
[01:03:30]  You got nothing.  Sorry.  I mean, I can go to an R-rated movie and handle it very well, you know.  Oh, wow.  Great.  What was the last R-rated movie you've been to?  Let me see.  It was something that went out last year.  For some reason, they gave it like a PG rating, but it should have been a very strong R rating.  The Rules of Attraction.  They really rated that movie.  And boy, you were able to handle that movie, huh?  Thank God.  That's correct.  You know what movie you should be trying to handle? 
[01:04:00]  What?  Throat Yogurt.  Volumes 1 through 10.  That's handling a freaking movie.  Oh.  She'd freak out if she even saw anything like that.  I've always wanted to see the old classic, I Am Curious Yellow.  There's so much about it, but I wasn't allowed to see it.  It's a movie about my chest.  What's I Am Curious Yellow all about?  It was a movie that came out in 68 or 69.  It was the first X-rated movie.  Oh, that must look great.  Someone get the synopsis on that movie. 
[01:04:30]  I've got to see what this stupid movie was about.  I'll look it up.  X-Ratings.  Can I tell you something?  Midnight Cowboy was rated X when it came out, and it won the Oscars as an X-rated film,  so it's probably not even hardcore sex.  It's not porn.  No.  They're X-rated movies.  It was a girl who was born with her clit in her throat.  That's what the movie said.  With her clit?  Yeah, in her throat.  That's deep throat.  No, her clit.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Deep throat is the name of the film.  Okay, that was another one that came out.  Wait, she was born with her clit in her throat?  The thing of deep throat is that she had a clit in her throat, and that's why she gave 
[01:05:00]  so much oral sex.  That's what deep throat was called.  Patty, what was the name of that movie you were talking about?  I Am Curious Yellow.  I Am Curious Yellow.  I Am Curious Yellow.  Yeah, but that was back in the middle.  What's it about, Patty?  Is it about an inquisitive Asian?  All I know is that it was, you know, this was a movie put out about that time, but I don't  remember, I don't know the story, then I guess I'm thinking of the second one. 
[01:05:30]  Lena, age 20, wants to know all she can about life and reality.  She collects information on everyone and everything.  Really?  Uh-oh.  Um, she experiments with relationships, political activism, and meditation.  Oh yeah, this just sounds great.  This is very hardcore.  Four, uh, nudity, explicit sex, and controversial politics kept this film from being shown in  the U.S. while its seizure by customs was appealed. 
[01:06:00]  1967.  What's the name of that movie?  The Irritating Dyke Who Eventually Became a College Professor Somewhere?  Ugh.  Doesn't that just sound horrible?  It was awful.  Yeah, it was like it was practically banned everywhere, but, you know, it was out.  And that's what you want to see before you die?  Oh, I don't know.  I've always wanted to see it.  How about you see a real live cock before you die?  Oh, someday I hope maybe my dreams will come true.  Do you remember the first person to ever touch your bosoms? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  And who was that?  Oh, it was in the studio.  Yeah, Jim Norton was the only person to ever feel up Stalker Patty.  Oh, my God, that was such a long time ago.  Faked cunnilingus and fellatio in that movie.  Really?  Do you know what that is, Patty?  Cunnilingus and fellatio?  I know the terms, but I can't really define them. 
[01:07:00]  No, let's try to define the terms.  Let's start with cunnilingus.  Cunnilingus.  Do you know what cunnilingus is?  I don't know.  Something to do with the veg.  You're 50 years old.  I know, but...  And you don't know what cunnilingus is.  I mean, I hear the term and everything.  It's what...  Yeah, well, you can hear it, but you don't know what it means.  Well, come on.  This is sad.  Yeah, what do you think it means?  I think...  I...  I am not sure to tell you the truth.  All right, well, what do you think?  I don't have a picture.  Well, what do I think? 
[01:07:30]  I don't really have a picture in my mind.  I think it has to do with sex in some way.  Could you take a guess?  Sex in some way.  What do you think cunnilingus means?  Um, I'm not...  Like, I don't know.  It's just regular, you know, missionary.  Missionary sex.  Cunnilingus is when a guy takes his fist.  Oh, come on now.  Don't freak her out and lie. 
[01:08:00]  It is not a fist.  It's usually done when the girl is experiencing her time of the month.  Oh, that's horrible.  You reach up there and pull out her uterus.  Right.  Oh, I don't think it's what that...  You pull it out so it's hanging out, and then you work it like a speed bag.  Girls seem to like this.  All right.  Really?  I can't imagine that.  All right, so you don't know what cunnilingus means.  Do you know what that means when a guy or a girl...  Yeah.  ...goes down on you?  Oh, well, let's see. 
[01:08:30]  I sure do get an education on the O&A show.  Would you like a guy or a girl to go down on you, Patty?  Yeah, Patty.  These were the questions we wanted to ask on our old radio show.  What's your opinion of cunnilingus?  You got to really know the other person.  No, you don't.  That's the beauty of it.  Right.  You don't have to see their face.  You're not talking to their face. 
[01:09:00]  Right.  Just an anonymous, awful back of the head in your lap while you pretend they're anyone  but who they really are.  That's what love is, stupid.  All right, so now you know what that means, right?  Yeah.  So what do you think?  Would that be fun?  Well, I've never been there, but you know, I've seen enough television to know that.  Television?  What television are you talking about? 
[01:09:30]  Well, when I dog-sit, I do like to watch some of the channels that I can't get here at home.  She just throws out these gems like they're nothing.  When I dog-sit, do you watch these things while you're applying that little red lipstick  to your mouth, do you?  No, I, you know, out of curiosity.  Red rocket.  Nothing more than that.  I watch CSI, Cunt Scene Investigation.  None of this stuff happens on TV.  Yeah.  They don't show that on television. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, you get panels that are kind of like, you know.  All right.  When she dog-sit, she puts that on, gets the old jar of peanut butter out, slathers it on.  Come here, Fluffy.  Come here.  Oh, Flay-Doh, that's so good.  All right, so it's kind of like making out with the vag there, Pat.  Right, and based on what you've already fessed up to the fact that you've touched yourself  down there and admitted it felt good.  Some people like to spell the alphabet with their tongue. 
[01:10:30]  Ah.  Really?  So wouldn't you think that would feel good based on what you felt with your own hand?  Imagine someone's tongue down there doing that.  You know, this is way too advanced for Patty.  It really is.  You think so?  We should start with 101.  Patty, what is the most sensitive part of a woman?  Most sensitive part of a woman?  Yeah.  I would say the part of the vagina, I guess, you know.  All right, what part?  It's called the labia. 
[01:11:00]  The what?  Wait, hold on.  Labia.  The what?  The labia.  Could you spell that, please?  L-A-B-I-A.  The labia.  Yeah.  She thinks the labia would be the most sensitive part.  Wow.  If you stretch it out and bite it, strap it in a mousetrap, perhaps.  I don't know.  Maybe the boobs.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Everyone but you.  You got that right. 
[01:11:30]  Patty, have you ever heard of a part of the female anatomy called the clitoris?  Yes.  Yeah.  That is your little secret button.  I think that's exactly what I meant.  I didn't mean to say the other.  Ah, you didn't mean to say it.  You got the labia and the clitoris confused.  Yes.  It's like when somebody meant to leave you in the hospital to have a checkup and instead  they accidentally left you in a diner, like that type of a little mix-up?  Yeah, a little mix-up.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, Patty. 
[01:12:00]  Patty, do you know what fellatio is?  Fellatio.  Is that something that two guys, like a two...  Maybe it's a party that Steve-O is at.  Yeah, possibly.  Or two men wearing the same shirt before they do McEnroe.  Easy.  I changed my shirt.  I didn't.  I think that's what it is.  Huh?  Well, I think it's when two guys, you know, whatever.  Do what?  Do what, Patty?  Well, when they, you know, have relations with each other.  I mean, that's, I think that's what it is. 
[01:12:30]  What type of relations, Patty?  You know, well, two gay men going at it.  Doing what?  You're saying relations, like what, the United Nations?  What are you talking about?  Yeah, be specific, Patty.  What is fellatio?  Well, I believe it's, I don't know, penis-to-penis contact?  Who knows?  I don't know.  I think it's a gay thing.  Penis-to-penis contact.  That's called LARPing.  Actually, it's called docking.  Docking?  Yes.  Docking.  What's docking? 
[01:13:00]  It's when, okay, a guy takes his penis and then touches the other guy's penis, and then  the other guy's uncut, and he covers his with the uncut portion of the other guy.  It was in my fetish book that we used to have around here.  You used to keep your hands off in the office.  Yes.  Ugh.  Yeah.  That's called docking.  Yes, I think, I mean, I have to consult my Funkin' Wagnalls and go back to the library.  Funkin' Wagnalls. 
[01:13:30]  What's your, what's Funkin' Wagnalls?  All right, so, Patty.  What is it?  What is that, Patty?  It's like your dictionary.  All right, Patty, that's not fellatio, okay?  No, no.  Fellatio, Patty, is like cunnilingus only for a guy.  Oh.  It's when a girl goes down and a girl, oh, you would never do that, right?  You just said, ew?  No.  I don't think so.  She is great for a gag video.  She would be great to just slap happy.  I'd love to see Brandon Iron choking her. 
[01:14:00]  A dummy on her forehead, just write dummy.  Why don't you?  Stick it right to the back of the throat.  Patty, why wouldn't you do that?  Well, it doesn't sound nice.  It sounds weird.  Hey, it's really nice.  It really is.  It's incredibly nice.  And it also guarantees you a ride home at the end of the date.  That's right.  Patty, what if everyone was clean and freshly showered?  Oh, it just sounds weird.  It's just something I don't think I could ever bring myself to do, you know? 
[01:14:30]  You couldn't just grab somebody down there and just maybe kiss it a little?  If it was my own husband, maybe.  See, you're not going to get a husband unless you do that.  You're not going to get a boyfriend.  You're too hung up.  No, I guess.  Yes, you are.  Don't even deny it.  Why wouldn't you want to put that in your mouth there, Patty?  I know.  It just seems kind of, it's like, I mean, you know, I hear about it so much and everything,  but it just seems weird. 
[01:15:00]  Patty, did last time you...  Let me ask you a question.  Did you ever have one of those in your face?  No.  Maybe in an attic?  No.  The smell of mothballs wafting through the air?  No.  Did you have to go to the closet to pray when you were a child?  You know, but who's to say, you know, like, if I ever start dating and I get serious with  somebody, who's to say?  Who's to say?  You disgusting cocksucker.  Who's to say? 
[01:15:30]  Who knows what the future holds?  Yeah.  I did go to a psychic once.  You know, a friend of mine had a friend who was a psychic, and she says, I'll meet somebody.  For some people, it's early in life.  For some people, it's later.  Yeah, you'll meet someone.  The funeral director that's putting you in a box.  Just have to realize I won't be the person's first.  What?  She says, I just have to realize that I will not be the person's first.  Oh, what, you would be your ideal guy as someone who also has not had sex yet, right? 
[01:16:00]  No, not really, because anybody I meet my age now most likely has already had it.  They've also almost retired.  Yeah, they've had sex and Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Well, I'll go down as far as age 35 and up because of my age.  And as down as his belly button.  Yeah, and then she stops right there.  Would you let me ask you?  I want to know right now.  Oh, no.  Before we go any further, would you love me?  Would you love me forever? 
[01:16:30]  Do you need me?  Do you never leave me?  Would you make me so hippie for the rest of my life?  Oh, how do you stink?  I know.  You're just the worst.  And we still can't get a gyno to check you out.  Would you ever kiss a guy on the bag?  No.  If it smelled a little like Funyuns?  No.  No.  After a good lawn cutting?  I would love just the scenario of her actually feeling for someone so much that she decides 
[01:17:00]  to give him that extra special treat and go down on him with no knowledge whatsoever as  to what happens when that completes and just gets a shot in the mouth and has no clue what  it is.  Patty, would you spit, swallow, or gargle?  Well, you know that some fine ladies out there like to ingest.  I like watching Bukiki videos.  What's wrong with covering up with a condom? 
[01:17:30]  Everything.  Huh?  It's not necessary.  Age is overrated.  It doesn't happen that often.  Cure it with Tylenol.  Yeah.  All right, Patty.  I think we've got enough out of you today.  Okay.  Much too much.  Unfortunately, we don't have anyone that wants to check out your badge yet.  I can't understand why after this phone call.  I know, right?  All right.  Okay.  Well, have a great day, guys.  Your false peppiness is making me physically ill.  Isn't it?  She's going to go, hang up the phone. 
[01:18:00]  Back in 1984, Anthony, as we continue with this, Oswald from Jersey.  Oswald from Jersey points out that Miami Vice debuts on NBC.  Watch Miami Vice and just notice how out of date all the fashions are.  Yes.  Of course.  Also, back in 1984, Van Halen toured with David Lee Roth.  Also, back in 1984, David Lee Roth had all his hair.  Oh, that's true.  All right, Patty.  Well, oh, wait. 
[01:18:30]  This guy wants to take you on a date.  One of our fine listeners from Dallas.  Yes, it's Paul.  Hey, Paul.  What's going on?  Probably a gentleman.  Hey, man.  Just trucking down the road.  All right, cool.  A fine trucker wants to say hi to Stalker Patty.  Go ahead, Paul.  Hey, Patty.  I was wanting to know, have you ever had anal?  And if you would, could I be your first?  Oh.  I've never had anal, and I would have to know the guy really, really well.  No, you don't.  You don't look at him.  I'm confused myself.  My name is Paul. 
[01:19:00]  Hi, Paul.  I'm from Kentucky, actually.  I'm a truck driver.  I'm in Dallas.  I'll let you get up in my truck.  I'll let you honk the horn.  Really?  I'll let you honk your butt.  Yeah.  I'll be honking a horn, huh?  Yeah, you honk the horn when I'm honking your butt.  Oh, okay.  We'll make beautiful honks together.  Oh, exactly.  Patty.  Yes?  He wants to violate your ass.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  She's thinking about it. 
[01:19:30]  Would you be able to say yes?  I'll consider it.  Patty, it's smart.  I won't hurt you.  Yeah, would you consider taking one up in the old poop chute?  Oh, I don't know.  Give her the old Kobe.  Hey, I hear how painful it is.  It's very scary.  Well, not for him it won't be painful.  Yeah.  It's not that painful.  Very scary.  But in a weird way, it seems like you would think about it.  Have you had fantasies about getting one in the poop chute? 
[01:20:00]  No.  Biting the pillow.  I mean, I can't believe in the eyes, but it seems like it's a good impression.  Pulls out a little Godiva at the tip.  Well, let's just see what the future brings.  Yeah.  Mylar suits, flying cars, and your virginity.  All right, Patty.  We'll find a gyno for you.  Thank you.  Okay.  I got to get ready for work now.  Yeah.  You do that.  Yeah, you do that. 
[01:20:30]  I've got to go make the chocolates.  That's a big joke down there in Godiva.  Time to make the chocolates.  Time to make the chuklets.  I hear you.  Oh, yeah.  So, trust me.  Whenever I ever get...  All right.  There you go.  Patty.  Hang up on that mess.  Man, that is a big, big problem.  Yeah.  She is just a problem.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll talk about McEnroe and the McEnroe show we did yesterday.  Also, got lots of stuff to talk about.  Can we talk about Jeffrey Jones? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, we can.  Okay.  Who's Jeffrey Jones?  The principal from Ferris B.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That just came in.  Yeah.  Oh, I hadn't read that one.  And I know he's a notorious child porn on...  Yeah, look at...  What am I looking for?  What's the word I'm looking for?  Connoisseur.  Connoisseur.  That's the word.  Thank you.  Look at him.  He looks like just hell.  Got a big 70s mustache.  He's a classic.  It might be part of hot teen news today.  It's hot for somebody out there.  Also, Jessica Simpson's husband is pretty much cheating on Jessica. 
[01:21:30]  We got the story and...  Doesn't matter what you have at home.  And also, Ted Nugent checking in today, Anthony.  The Nuge will be checking in with us.  I believe Sully from Godsmack, if he got any sleep last night, he's a huge Boston Red Sox  fan.  He's calling in to say hi.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  I wonder who Ted's voting for.  Oh, boy.  He's undecided between Bush and Nader.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yeah.  All right.  So, as we go to break, we're going to play another one of these mashups.  It's Eminem with the help of Paul McCartney and Wings. 
[01:22:00]  Check this out.  Let's hope this one turns out pretty darn good, huh?  Guess who's back.  Back again.  Shady's back.  Tell a friend.  Guess who's back.  Back again.  Shady's back.  Tell a friend.  I've created a monster.  If nobody wants to see more, so no more, they want shady.  I'm sharp.  Well, if you want shady, this is what I'll give you.  A little bit of weed mix with some heart.  They got some vodka that I've jumped off. 
[01:22:30]  My heart quicker than the shock.  When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating.  When I'm rocking the table while he's operating.  You waiting this long to stop debating.  Cause I'm back.  I'm on the brag and ovulating.  I know that you got a job, Miss Cheney.  But your husband's heart problems complicating.  So the FCC won't let me be.  You'll let me be me.  So let me see.  They try to shut me down on MTV.  But it feels so empty without me.  So come on and dip.  Bow on your lips.  Fuck that.  Come on your lips.  So someone to tip them, get ready.  Cause this shit's about to get heavy.  I just settled on my lawsuit.  Fuck you, Debbie. 
[01:23:00]  Now this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy.  Cause it feels so empty without me.  I say this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy.  But it feels so empty without me.  Little hell yeah.  Kids feeling rebellious.  Embarrassed.  The parents still listen to Elvis.  They start feeling like prisoners helpless.  Cause someone comes along on a mission and yells,  A visionary.  Vision is scary.  It's called a revolution.  We're looting the airwaves to revel.  So just let me revel and bask in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass. 
[01:23:30]  And it's a disaster.  Such a catastrophe.  For you to see some game.  Much of my ass.  You ask for me.  Well, I'm back.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Fix your minutes and it's looming in and then I'm in the inner inner inner front of your skin.  Like a splinter.  The center of attention.  Back for the winner.  I'm in arresting.  The best things.  Investing.  Investing.  In your kids' ears and nesting.  Investing.  Attention, please.  Feel the tension.  Soon as no one mentions me.  Here's my ten cents.  My two cents is free.  A nuisance.  Two cents.  You sent for me.  Now this looks like a time for me.  So everybody doesn't follow me.  We need a little controversy. 
[01:24:00]  Cause it's killing no issues without me.  I say this looks like a time for me.  So everybody doesn't follow me.  We need a little controversy.  Cause it's killing no issues without me.  Love doesn't come in a minute.  Sometimes it doesn't come at all.  I only know that when I'm in it, it isn't silly.  Love isn't silly.  Love isn't silly at all. 
[01:24:30]  I say this looks like a time for me.  So everybody doesn't follow me.  Cause we get a little controversy.  Cause it kills no issues without me.  I say this looks like a time for me.  So everybody doesn't follow me.  Cause we get a little controversy.  Cause it kills no issues without me.  I say this looks like a time for me.  So everybody doesn't follow me.  Cause we get a little controversy.  Cause it kills no issues without me.  I say this looks like a time for me.  So everybody doesn't follow me.  Cause we get a little controversy.  Cause it kills no issues without me. 
[01:25:00]  Come on, poogie, let's burn this motherfucker down!  Here we go, now.  Would you take your pants off and dance around a little?  No, I'm not going to.  Damn it!  Oh, kill yourself.

Word up.  It's the cold word.  No matter what you say it.  You know that's over there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  A big hi to everyone that turned on their XM Satellite radios overnight. 
[01:29:00]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America slowly but surely.  Today.  Having a lot of fun.  Mmm.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tony in Jersey.  He's been playing GTA, Anthony.  The hottest game in America.  Who hasn't?  Let's say hi to Tony.  Hey, Tom.  How you doing, man?  What do you got?  I think the game needs to be recalled.  I found a major, major flaw in it.  Major flaw in San Andreas. 
[01:29:30]  It's got to be a programming error or something.  All right.  What is that?  First two games, you're a white dude.  You land in the water.  What happens?  You drown.  Yeah.  This game, you're a black guy.  I land in a fountain.  Yeah.  He swims.  And that's the flaw because black people can't swim?  Yeah.  Like, what, is he going to ski later in the game?  Is he going to ski?  As long as I don't have him getting out of the fountain and showing up on time for work,  I don't mind.  Have you had the guy run around in his underwear yet?  Later in the game, he's going to attempt to play ice hockey. 
[01:30:00]  You know, I would love to just simply go, you know, you're being racist and all that,  but I kind of witnessed this thing, you know, firsthand when I was at Ben's summer place this year.  Ooh.  And Earl, who's black, doesn't help the stereotype because this guy was petrified of freaking the water.  Well, that World Series ring weighs him down.  Right.  So it might pull him right to the bottom.  He was taking on a little narrow dock that was kind of, you know, not really anchored down, 
[01:30:30]  so it's going with the waves as the boats are coming in and out.  He was petrified that he was going to fall in and not be able to swim to safety.  Yeah.  Ben!  Ben!  With his Doc Martens on and the borrowed bathing suit because he didn't bring his...  Well, the black dress shoes, yeah.  That's great.  Wearing black dress shoes.  Yeah.  So, I mean, he was completely out of his mind that he was going to fall in and drown.  There is a stereotype, and from what I've seen, it's pretty accurate that black people aren't the best of swimmers. 
[01:31:00]  And a lot of times, especially here in New York, you read the news about a drowning out at, like, Jones Beach or something,  and, man, they show a picture and you go, oh, could you learn how to, you know, do a few strokes, perhaps?  Yeah.  Well, how was GTA?  You were playing it last night, right?  I had a commercial for it right there.  Yeah.  On NBC.  No, I don't think that's a commercial.  I think that's the first news piece.  Oh, they're doing a news piece on how violent it is?  Oh, yeah.  The first news piece.  Oh, look at that.  It's showing the drive-by.  Oh, right up. 
[01:31:30]  Oh!  Katie Couric and Matt Lauer are disgusted.  Look at them.  They got their serious news faces on.  This game should be banned.  Our children are playing this.  Oh, this game.  We don't even have to put the audio up.  It's this story.  Racial stereotypes and violence are all over this game.  Katie, do you understand what is going on in this game?  One of the funniest parts of the game so far, I just started playing last night.  I love the game.  Starts out, you have nothing but a bicycle. 
[01:32:00]  You got to jump on a bicycle.  Your homies are making fun of you because you don't look good.  So I went to the barbershop and I spent some money and got a big afro hairdo.  And I got my hair did.  And now I look all cool.  Now I look all cool on my bicycle.  And the homies and my, you get the skill, different skill levels.  Yeah.  And apparently my sex appeal went up when I got the big afro.  So now I ride around with that.  So you're riding on the bicycle and this car comes up and starts shooting at you with some homeboys in it. 
[01:32:30]  And you got to hook up with your homies.  And it's sort of like almost the beginning of the game is almost a tutorial of how you're going to be using the different controls and stuff during the game.  One of the funniest parts so far, I'm trying to tag right over, spray paint over the opposition gang's tags.  And they're coming up to me, a couple of them, because I'm not on my turf, Opie.  I'm in their turf.  So they're coming up to me one by one and going, what you doing here, nigga?  You know, hey, what you doing? 
[01:33:00]  Who is that over there?  And then they all start coming over to you.  I hear the N-word is just flying.  Oh, it's crazy.  Nothing right in this game.  Crazy.  So they start coming over like they're going to kick my ass.  Yeah.  Well, out of nowhere, this is the game.  It's great.  Out of nowhere, a fire truck rolls up.  Sirens wailing.  This is in the game.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sirens wailing.  Opens up the fire hoses on the group of black guys that are in the street and just throws them right out to the road.  I'm sitting there with the controller in my hand, just laughing my ass off that they put this in the game. 
[01:33:30]  They don't care.  They do not care.  At Rockstar Games, they don't care about being PC.  No, this game is going to be pulled off the shelves.  I actually went out to get a drink and came back.  What's the name of this game?  The Good Old Days?  Jesus.  But they also make Whitey look pretty bad in the game, too, right?  Yeah.  Well, I noticed playing the lead character, a black guy, in the game, I noticed the easiest way for me to make money is to drive out. 
[01:34:00]  The levels are huge.  The game area is giant.  So they've got city areas and then they've got rural areas.  So I found myself, I'm just driving, trying to look at the different areas and see what's available.  So I ended up out in the country, Opie.  There's farmland, there's guys on tractors, there's stores.  So I found the easiest way to make a little fast cash is to go into the white areas and just beat up white people and take their money. 
[01:34:30]  And it's easy.  No cops wind up coming because there's no cops in the rural areas.  The white people do not fight back either.  Like you start beating up a black guy in the city and he'll turn around and start punching you.  Or they pull out a, there was one hooker, I tried to work her out of her cash.  She pulls out a gun and starts shooting at me.  It's a little dangerous.  So I went all the way to the country, went into the white neighborhoods and just, there was a guy sitting on a porch of his house.  I walked over and he goes, what you doing here, boy? 
[01:35:00]  He did not say that.  Swear.  Boy.  Well, I pulled out a baseball bat and caved his skull in and took his money.  And as you're taking his money, he goes, you won't be needing this no more.  Just steal his money.  And then I hopped in his tractor and I drove down there, a black guy on a tractor in the country.  It is probably one of the most entertaining games I've played yet.  And I just started.  I have no idea what, you know, three quarters of the game, I'm not even, uh, three quarters of the game area. 
[01:35:30]  Didn't you go into a restaurant or something and just, uh, rob all the white people in the restaurant too?  Yeah, yeah, white people in the restaurant.  I went into the restaurant, a bunch of white people there.  The first white person I cracked over the head with a shovel, uh, all the other white people cowered at their table.  They put their hands up and just cowered.  And, uh, I just went one by one, cracking them over the head with a shovel and taking their money.  I don't play video games, as you know.  No, no, you don't.  I hate them. 
[01:36:00]  I watched you play in this for a couple minutes yesterday.  Yeah.  I'm going to buy a PlayStation 2.  Oh, you have to.  And I'm going to get this game.  These games, you will enjoy this.  They're just great.  I know.  I could see it.  Because, uh, I mean, you could do the missions, you know, that's what the whole game's about.  You do mission after mission, eventually get to the, you know, the grand finale.  Or you could just mess around with your environment for hours upon hours.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, eventually, I'm sure you haven't found the motorcycles yet.  Oh, I found a motorcycle.  Oh, yeah.  I was cruising around on those.  You could steal a motorcycle, and then you could just explore for hours and find motorcycle 
[01:36:30]  jumps.  It's, it's, it's, yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Then there's hookers.  You pull up next to a hooker with your car.  Oh, yeah.  How's the hooker thing in this one?  Pretty cool.  Yeah.  Let me explain the old one for Jim, and then you could tell me how they updated it, maybe.  In the last game, I forgot what it was called.  Vice City?  Oh, yeah.  Vice City.  You pull your ride up to a hooker, right?  And you have some small talk, and all of a sudden, the hooker jumps in your ride, and  then you go kind of park under a tree or something, and then you watch the car just kind of...  You have sex with the hooker, and your health goes up a little bit. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, your health goes up, unlike real life where it goes down, but so then the hooker  gets out and goes pretty much, thank you, baby, and starts walking away.  Takes some of your money, too.  Yeah, it takes your money.  Your money goes down a little bit after you're done with the hooker, and then you, as the  scumbag, you jump out of the car, take the baseball bat, and kill her, and then you  get to take your money back.  You take her money.  Is that like, okay, after you give her the money, do you ever realize, like, wow, I  thought you were a girl, and then you don't get the money back, and then your health goes 
[01:37:30]  down, and you'll lose your money?  Yeah.  I'm noticing my T-cell count is going down on the score.  And then you have to go home and clean the awful breath off your mule as your friend Tyler  knocks on the bathroom door and goes, hey, man, how was it?  And you're so filled with shame and self-hatred, you go, oh, it was really good, man, because  you don't want to admit your accidental homosexual encounter.  That's kind of how the game goes, is it?  Was that guy you're talking about in that hypothetical situation, did he actually smell  manly breath on his junk?  Oh, yes, he did.  Awful, awful breath. 
[01:38:00]  Wafting up from his crotch.  Oh, is that bad?  Yeah, it was.  So, in the new game, the hooker thing, anything different?  No, it's pretty much the same.  Pretty much the same?  If you feel so inclined, she gets out of the car, and you cave her head in and take her  money.  But you've got to watch out, because the hookers in this game also can jack your  car from you.  Right.  So they'll steal from you.  I'm a little confused here.  I'm watching the morning shows.  It's like battle of the diseases right now.  You've got Michael J. Fox talking about Parkinson's on our right TV and on our left TV. 
[01:38:30]  It's Good Morning America, and Mel Gibson is now doing the whole stem cell thing.  What?  He's an advocate for the stem cell research?  Yeah, he's doing the stem cell thing.  Poor Michael J. Fox has developed this weird way of speaking where he's constantly gesticulating  and moving, so it takes away from the fact that it's really awful to watch this guy.  It really is just a horrible disease this guy has.  Yeah, he doesn't want to make it obvious, so he's very animated when he talks.  He's kind of moving around to make it look like it's very animated, but he is just twitching 
[01:39:00]  like an old rambler.  The stagehand keeps filling up his coffee.  They're trying to get it to the top there for the poor guy.  She spilled my coffee.  What can I get for you, Michael?  Coffee and a straw?  I do feel bad for this poor guy because he moves his arms no matter what he's talking about.  It doesn't really matter.  No, that sucks, actually.  Are they going for the stem cell research on that one, too?  Look at him. 
[01:39:30]  He's tapping his foot.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in Kentucky.  What's up, John?  Oh, poor bastard.  You guys got a great fucking show, but I was curious if you guys ever have heard any video  games that actually have any real nudity or just kind of really made for adults.  I'm not sure if the new Playboy video game's coming out.  Have you guys ever played or any heard of anything like that?  Yeah.  Well, I hear the Playboy game's going to get pretty crazy, right?  I think Duke Nukem had some nude women in it, strippers and stuff.  There are some games that have it.  The old GTA game, Vice City had a strip club where you sat there with all these dirty old 
[01:40:00]  men.  You notice when you go into the strip club in the old game, it's all like fat, dirty old  bowling guys, and then they have a stage where the girls are dancing, and then you can go  in the back room and they'll do a lap dance for you.  Lap dance, yeah.  It's kind of fun.  You know, they have Sims, The Sims.  Yeah, yeah, you can download a patch for The Sims and see them naked when they're taking  a leak or taking a shower.  Is that Rockstar as well, The Sims?  No, no.  Nah.  That's EA?  No, no, that's whatever. 
[01:40:30]  That's not even sure.  Just another gaming company.  All right, John, thanks.  Did somebody throw out Steve-O's ashtray from yesterday?  Ah, is that still in here?  Yes.  I thought we were going to put the duct tape up on eBay.  Yeah.  Where did that blue duct tape go?  One of our sick listeners will buy it.  I mean, that Stupa Oompa Loompa shirt on eBay is up to $500.  Is it?  $500, well, like $482, something like that, with three days to go.  Josh in Boston, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Just with the GTA, the new one, San Andreas.  Yeah.  When you get arrested, you go down to the police department bathroom, pick up a double-ended 
[01:41:00]  dildo and beat the cops with it.  A double-ended dildo in the police station bathroom.  Yep.  What game is this, mister?  Same one.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you, Josh.  No problem.  Yeah, look, another person claiming there's a dildo weapon.  Oh, we're just hung up on him?  All right.  A dildo weapon.  I'm hanging up on the bad Howard Cosell impression.  I don't think that's going to work today.  Why?  Howard Cosell impressions are always funny.  Awful.  All right.  Coming up, edit. 
[01:41:30]  Muhammad Ali.  That's good, right?  I do a lot of impressions.  I like that one.  I didn't want to override Ant's impressions, but I do a lot of impressions, man.  That's a good one.  Let's hear another one.  Nah, I don't want to show off.  All right.  All right.  Oh!  That's my walking.  No!  That's good, right?  That's very good.  Looks like there's two people doing some impressions on this radio program.  Sounded just like him.  I, I, if I was turned around, I would have thought he walked into the studio.  Fantastic.  If you were to turn around, I'd let you toot my horn while I raped your ass. 
[01:42:00]  That was a great little, I'll let you beep the horn, Patty.  And the guy in the truck.  That really made me laugh.  Um, we got to talk about the John McEnroe show a little bit here, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  That, uh, we, we taped it.  We made our first talk show appearance.  Yeah, it was the, uh, boy, we got some great people working for us behind the scenes.  They got us on John McEnroe, which is, uh, pretty much the lowest rated show in America.  Yeah.  I don't even think they have a rating.  Except, except for one show is worse than the John McEnroe show in the ratings, and it's 
[01:42:30]  some kind of show on the Food Network.  It's on the Food Network, yeah.  But it was our first, uh, talk show appearance.  It was kind of cool to go through that whole talk show thing.  And, uh, and, uh, hmm.  Yeah, they decided to air it last night.  It's already one of the lowest rated shows in America, and then they put it up against,  uh, I don't know, the Red Sox winning the World Series for the first time since 1918.  So, uh, McEnroe, the World Series, whether you don't know.  For the ten dedicated, uh, fans that watched the show last night, thank you.  We greatly appreciate it. 
[01:43:00]  If you missed it, I guess the video is up on opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  But it was a lot of fun.  We met an old friend, uh, while we were doing makeup.  Oh, Dee Snider.  Dee Snider.  He's going to be on the show in the very near future.  Yeah.  And, uh, also, uh, who else was there?  Uh, what's his name there?  Uh, uh, Conan's guy there was.  Andy Richter.  Andy Richter.  They were all doing the show with you?  Uh, he was in another, like, dressing room.  He couldn't be bothered.  They, uh, they, they seemed to tape a bunch of segments and just place them together on 
[01:43:30]  a show and make it a show.  Like, we were on the same show as that pool shooting girl.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  The girl that shot pool.  She was featured in, I guess, Stuff Magazine or something.  All right.  And...  It wasn't the Black Widow, was it?  I don't know.  The really hot kind of Asian pool?  She was hot.  No, she wasn't Asian, though.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah.  She, uh, she was on the show last night, but we never saw her.  It wasn't done the same day.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  So they just kind of put segments together and that was that.  But it was kind of cool to, you know, because you grow up watching the talk shows and then 
[01:44:00]  to actually have to do it where you wait and then they announce you and you come out from  the wing and look at the audience and we were waiting in the dopey little wave.  It was really surreal because we're waiting in the wings, waiting for our introduction  and then we come walking out.  We have to do that wave to the crowd.  Like...  I have no clue how to do a talk show like that.  All I know is what I've watched growing up watching The Tonight Show.  Yeah.  So it's like you just do what you watched on TV.  Yeah, that's exactly... 
[01:44:30]  You give the wave.  You sit down.  You shake his hand.  How are you doing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jump.  Jump on the couch.  Fake trip on the way to the stage.  Whoa!  John McEnroe shakes her hand as we come out and a little small talk.  He's like...  Yeah.  And I'm like...  Back.  You got to do the small talk when they go into commercial.  Yeah.  They pan away.  You lean over.  And as a matter of fact, I think they cut it out, though.  They cut it out.  They went really quick.  We want to play some of this interview because they cut out a lot of stuff because we explained  the wiffle ball bat challenge in detail and...  They cut that out.  They cut that way down. 
[01:45:00]  But when they go to commercial, I was always, from watching all those talk shows growing up,  they always would lean over, and either the two people on the couch or the host and someone  on the couch, they're talking to each other.  And you always think, jeepers, I wonder what they're saying.  They're saying absolutely nothing.  They're saying nothing.  So I figured I would do that.  So when they went to commercial and the camera starts panning away, I leaned over to Opie  and just went...  And at that point, I was leaning toward Johnny and just said...  So nothing was being said, but it looked like we were saying something. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, you know what I said during commercial, this is the truth?  I go, John...  I did actually say something as we're going to break.  I go, John, where did you get this audience from?  Oh my God, I know.  And he didn't get it.  He goes, oh, we bust them in from Times Square.  They go to Rockefeller Center.  Rockefeller Center, right.  They go around Rockefeller Center and hand out tickets and go, here's free tickets to  John McEnroe Show.  Right.  And then they bust them over to...  They bust them in.  Jersey.  But I meant, where did you get this audience from?  I know.  Because these guys were scary looking.  There were a couple of guys that were ripped from Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  They were just ripped right from the game.  Honestly, I think they pulled the bus right up to the unemployment line.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  Because these people looked like they really didn't have jobs.  There was one huge woman that was asleep in the chair when we came walking in.  She was passed out.  Yeah.  She looked a little drunk, if I may say.  Just a bit?  Yeah.  Then you had two homies in their huge oversized jacket.  You're going, man, you guys are funny. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Those are the Grand Theft Auto guys.  It was like a couple of gangbangers sitting in the audience.  I was praying they had a metal detector before these guys came in, because some of them were  really scary.  And then they were assorted young and old people.  And then Johnny, like halfway through...  Johnny.  Johnny.  Like we're on Johnny Carson.  Sure, why not?  Johnny.  Yeah.  I want people to think it was a bigger deal than it really was.  Just like Johnny Carson without the ratings.  Yeah.  So Johnny there asked the audience how many people have satellite radio.  And I'm looking at him like, are you kidding me? 
[01:47:00]  Look at these people.  None of these people have satellite radio.  None of them.  I think two people raised their hand.  It was the homies.  And I think because they just stole an Escalade.  Yes, sir.  Like that.  How many people have satellite radio on this?  No, I uncomfortably said, wow, there's one.  Yeah.  Or something.  There's one or two.  Oh, but a bit of good news on the same subject.  Yes.  I saw a fan yesterday.  Yeah.  And he is from Poughkeepsie.  Been a big fan for a long time.  Been out of the area.  And they said he's really looking forward to the return of the Opie and Anthony show whenever 
[01:47:30]  that happens.  So I just wanted to say...  Great.  Thumbs up to XM for getting the word out up in Poughkeepsie.  Yeah, I get that.  Hey, so when do you start?  Yep, got that.  When do you start?  So I guess we're just wasting time right now until we actually start.  Yeah, until we actually start.  This is the warm-up.  Ben, could I ask you something?  Yes.  Do you have to change the channel to Red Sox coverage every two seconds?  Ben cannot have either one of these TVs running without Red Sox celebration on both of them. 
[01:48:00]  Over and over and over again.  He goes through the channel.  The second the subject changes, he searches out more Red Sox coverage and puts it on.  Yes, they won.  They won the World Series.  Now you know what?  Now the Red Sox fans will understand what it's like.  You win, and then you know what happens?  It just goes away, and you have to do it again.  I'm sorry.  But after today, and the glory wears off, they'll have the big parade up there in Boston.  They'll all get drunk and throw up on each other, and then it's over, and no one thinks about it.  I haven't seen this much jubilation and group hugging since Jeffrey Jones hosted Romper Room. 
[01:48:30]  All right, we'll get to Jeffrey Jones in a minute.  You're obsessed with Jeffrey Jones.  How can you not be?  It's Schilling and Theo.  You've got to give Theo some credit.  Is he 29?  Switch it to another station.  Sorry.  You know, you can put one TV on the Boston coverage and give us something else on the other channel so we can goof on that, okay?  So anyway, Anthony, we've got the John McEnroe audio.  Some old pals made fun of us because we were on the John McEnroe show trying to get to us.  Ooh. 
[01:49:00]  Ooh.  Don and Mike.  Those guys, man, don't get on their bad side.  These idiots in Washington just playing into our hands once again.  Oh, gosh.  You best not get on our bad side.  You're darn tootin' we'll do something to you.  We sure will.  I'll have my wife, who's about as funny as prostate cancer, call in and put your audience to sleep, too.  That's right.  Maybe instead of doing John McEnroe, you should marry some dull whore and have her call into your radio show for three hours a day. 
[01:49:30]  You fucking irrelevant, fat, middle-aged boars.  Love you, boo-boo.  Blah!  Fucking one-market ponies.  You stink.  You bombed in New York, and you bombed in Philadelphia,  and you are dying like Michael Landon in Buffalo.  Motherfuckers.  It's the Don and Mike show.  No, it's not anymore.  They got a .01.  How do you get a .03 in the biggest radio market in the country?  Yeah, they ate it bad in New York. 
[01:50:00]  And then when we effed up and went away for two years, the company said,  well, we know the solution because Anthony and I were huge in almost 20 cities,  so they're like, we'll just put Don and Mike.  Plug in Don and Mike.  We'll just put Don and Mike in all these cities, and the ratings will stay right where they are.  Yeah.  Wrong.  Plummeted.  This is how confident I am in this radio show.  Turn off XM today if you live in D.C., and enjoy Don and Mike for a couple hours.  Enjoy it.  See where that gets you.  Oh, boo-boo, you left some dirty underwear on the floor. 
[01:50:30]  Did I really?  Ha-ha, forced laugh.  Ha-ha, forced laugh.  Fat, irrelevant dullards.  Kids kicked out of New York, kicked out of Philly, being kicked out of other cities.  Yeah.  They're in a bunch of tiny little markets.  Yeah.  They stink.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All of America is talking about the Don and Mike show.  Yeah.  And you're going to try to make fun of us.  Okay.  We understand where we're at.  You know, we're in the underdog position.  But you know what?  We're going to be right back on top again.  Guaranteed.  What's worse, being on a talk show that really has no ratings, or not even being asked to 
[01:51:00]  be on a talk show that doesn't have any ratings?  Or how about this?  When Opie and Anthony are kicked off the air, maybe this is worse.  Maybe you finally get your shot in Philly in drive time.  No one is competing with you, and you still bomb.  How does that feel?  You have a huge audience to start with.  And they have to take you off the air.  You guys were number one by far in afternoons.  It wasn't even close, and you lost the entire audience.  It's not like, oh, when they went somewhere, they left, you had nothing. 
[01:51:30]  People said, we would rather listen to nothing than listen to you.  Do you understand?  Dead air beat you.  You fucking failed in New York, and you failed in Philadelphia.  How does that feel?  And they're failing in many other cities.  How do you look at your awful wife when you're banging her?  Good call today, boo-boo.  With your bloated face.  You have to look at that bloated face in the mirror every morning.  You stink.  You hate yourself.  You know it.  So Peter in Toronto says, happened to tune in to Don and Mike yesterday at 5 p.m. 
[01:52:00]  They said that O&A were relegated to satellite radio and now have to appear on McEnroe's lowest-rated show.  As opposed to McEnroe's high-rated show?  How about the, you want to do something with a smaller audience?  How about Don and Mike in New York and Philly combined?  That had a smaller audience than McEnroe?  O&A were relegated to satellite radio.  Do you understand we're becoming bigger than we've ever been?  Do you understand that every publication in America is talking about Opie and Anthony?  Do you understand that the New York Times did a huge feature on your pal's O&A in the arts and leisure section? 
[01:52:30]  And it wasn't buried in the back of the arts and leisure section.  It was the front page and then went on for another one of those big, huge New York Times pages.  You're right.  My bad.  It's time for the news.  Good gosh, Boo Boo.  And Donnie, baby.  What talk show are you going to be on in the near future that is shown all over America?  Even a low-rated talk show gets an audience, you idiots.  Isn't there that, oh, wait, wait, my partner's marriage failed because he pushed his wife through something? 
[01:53:00]  Isn't that a new talk show?  I forget where that's being played.  I think that one is.  I have the breath of garbage juice.  Is that the talk show you're going to be on?  Fucking diaper gums?  Do you know the microphone had to be cleaned every day when open on because of your awful dumpster gums?  That was really bad.  Your rotting meat breath?  I can only imagine why it smells that bad. 
[01:53:30]  Ugh.  Whose ass are you eating out?  Jesus.  Honey, I got to go to work.  Just put your tongue in there, Boo Boo.  Mama has a kidney bean she needs eating out.  As you're thinking that we're relegated to satellite radio, just check out that fine advertisement in Rolling Stone magazine, you zeros.  If you're in D.C., put on the Don and Mike show.  Walk away from O&A for a couple of days.  Please enjoy the Don and Mike show.  And when a show is relegated to satellite radio, you don't get opportunities like talking to the Chicago Sun-Times like we're doing today. 
[01:54:00]  Every day we're doing more and more interviews all over America.  All over America.  Dude, you're explaining something that you don't need to because they are responding to the fact that you guys are now back.  It's like, how do you explain to your listeners when you have bombed the two biggest radio markets or two of the top ten radio markets in the country?  How do you explain that to people?  They bombed.  Do you understand?  You tried it in New York.  You couldn't cut the mustard.  You couldn't do it.  You weren't talented enough.  Mohammed Atta has a higher rated radio show in New York City than you two fatzos did. 
[01:54:30]  Okay, let's do a little test in this computer age, Opie.  All right.  I went to Google, right?  All right.  I went to Google News.  Okay.  Which is, you put in the search engine, you will get every news item that comes up for whatever you're searching for.  All right.  Newspapers, TV.  Let's be fair because I know where you're going with this.  Why don't we just do the news articles that happened in the last two years?  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  I just put in Don and Mike. 
[01:55:00]  All right.  Don and Mike.  And I hit search news.  The first story that comes up is Beverly Hills neighbors don't like Mike either.  So the D-O-N for don't is Don.  Okay.  And then don't like Mike either.  So it's not even about Don and Mike.  Zero stories for Don and Mike.  Okay.  That couldn't be true.  Maybe the page is still loading, Ant. 
[01:55:30]  No.  When the Don part of it has to be the word don't.  It's not even Don and Mike.  As in don't listen if you expect a good laugh?  And these guys playing right into our hands because now they're mentioning to their audience in D.C.  that we're back on XM Sile Radio.  So they gave us another commercial.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm getting multiple hits, Opie.  Multiple hits.  That could be like eight hits.  Eleven, twelve.  I'm looking at pages here.  Oh, okay. 
[01:56:00]  There are pages.  I believe I'm up to page 13.  There's about 10 stories per page.  All right.  And this is just our recent press.  These are recent.  Like, I'm talking 2004.  There's pretty much every day our names are mentioned in a news story across America.  So I guess.  Let's say about 130 stories on ONA just from what I could see here.  Yeah.  In the recent weeks and months.  All right, but in all fairness, if you want to check up for Don and Mike, go to the Center 
[01:56:30]  for Gum Surgery.  Go there.  Find out the odor removal from Beneath Teeth Center.  Let me put in ass breath.  All right.  And see.  Yes, ass breath got more hits than Don and Mike.  Can you punch in booted out of New York slash Philly?  Let me put cunt wife and let me hit that.  Look at that.  Wow.  Geronimo slash Clinton. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, unbelievable.  Just shut up.  Just keep talking, talking, talking.  Keep talking, talking, talking.  That's all we care about.  Just keep getting our names out there.  Thanks for the advertising to your multitude of listeners that you have.  So, Anthony, we were on the John McEnroe show.  We openly admitted it was a low-rated talk show, but it is still a talk show. 
[01:57:30]  Who cares if it's low-rated?  And it's still being seen across America.  You know something?  I didn't even care about that.  It was something fun to do.  It was something cool that, you know, you don't do it.  How many people get to do a talk show?  I had a blast.  And as a kid watching, you know, I watched so much television as a kid.  It was fun to just be part of that whole thing.  We're very fortunate in our careers.  We've gotten to do a lot of things.  But yesterday, as I was coming back to Manhattan and Anthony was driving home or whatever, 
[01:58:00]  I called them all excited.  I'm like, Anthony, did we just do our first talk show?  I mean, it was our first little where we had to go out and sit on the couch.  I felt like I was like just, I don't know, a 20-year-old kid from Long Island again, man.  It was really exciting and a lot of fun.  You know, it's funny.  Sometimes you just want to do like a little thing like that.  Like when I went out and I was sitting there with Jay and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, I mean, sometimes you just want to like grind your heel into our little fun time we had.  Yeah, thanks.  Our little fun we had. 
[01:58:30]  He's on Leno.  He got to walk out and sit down and Jay fucking Leno is next to him.  He didn't get to sit.  He did his comedy in front of...  Oh, good comeback, Opie.  I think I actually did Bogart my way out of the couch because I actually think that they were going to just have to go backstage.  I guess we can compare the talk show appearances.  Yeah, Norton walks out and does his comedy routine in front of Jay Leno.  I mean, right in front.  Leno's at his desk and the cast of Will and Grace is sitting on the couch and they're all just laughing and laughing and laughing.  And we did our talk show appearance in front of a bunch of crack addicts. 
[01:59:00]  Bunch of crackheads.  And here's what that translates into.  Massive New York Times article slash no mention.  So I guess that didn't amount to a hill of beans, as Don and Mike would say.  Ha ha ha!  Hill of beans!  Did the FCC find us for that?  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh, golly gee willikers.  Oh, cut it out, you!  Oh, for the love of Eve!  By the way, here's a little message for Don and Mike, okay?  And this is the God's honest truth, okay?  Everyone knows Howard's going to the Little Doggy Company because the Little Doggy Company is very desperate and they're trying to turn their whole business around. 
[01:59:30]  That's a fact, okay?  Well, we know for a fact that Infinity Broadcasting wants to get Howie off the air.  They just want him off the air, okay?  But they don't have anyone in the wings that could step up and take over for Howie in all these markets.  That is a fact.  Every day these guys are meeting in boardrooms and stuff because we still have a lot of friends at Infinity Broadcasting. 
[02:00:00]  They are trying to figure out who's going to replace Howie when he moves on.  And they want to do it immediately.  They don't want him sitting in his chair anymore.  They want to pretty much shove it up his ass, okay?  The problem is we got fired.  We were the ones that were supposed to be in the wings, which is fine.  We're doing our own thing now.  But Don and Mike, you know, they're not even being considered for this.  Their own company is not even considering Don and Mike to replace Howie to get him out of his chair, Anthony. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Not even considering.  How does that make you feel, Donnie?  How does that make you feel?  You put in all those years.  All of Howie's radio markets are up for grabs.  And guess what?  You're not even being considered.  Your own company knows you're not good enough.  You've failed time and time again in major markets.  You cannot hold an audience.  And your own company, the company you've worked for for years, trying to work your way up in, has just written you off.  And I could take this to another level, but I don't want to ruin things, okay? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  I just don't want to ruin things right now.  But all right, all right, relax.  I'm not going to say anything.  Everyone's like, oh, my God, don't say that.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  There you go.  We know things.  We know things.  I'll bet you the first day that Howard made his announcement, I'll bet you that those two fat hands high-fived each other in the studio, thinking now it's finally our time.  I bet you he picked up the phone.  Oh.  Frida, pack your bags.  Frida.  Frida. 
[02:01:30]  Frida.  Get this.  Yes, boo-boo.  I'm taking over for the Howard Stern Show.  Oh.  Isn't this fantastic?  Frida, pack up our little party, and pack up your ass, and we're moving back to New York, baby.  We're moving back to New York.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Yes?  Yes, a telegram?  Urgent communique?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What?  Tell me what's going on. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know what you're saying.  I know.  People do.  Mr. Nugent is on line 12.  Oh.  That's what?  Jesus.  He doesn't say that?  No.  It says nothing.  Uh-oh.  That's not good.  All right.  Well, we were babbling enough about that anyway, so.  Well, let me explain something to you guys in that booth.  You can't do that.  You can't wave your arms.  You can't hold up pieces of paper with tiny writing on it from 30 feet away, and you can't  try to signal us.  It takes us completely out of what we're doing.  Okay. 
[02:02:30]  And it's better off to run in here and go, guys.  All right.  You guys panic like President Bush himself is on the line, and we've got to drop everything.  Like, oh, my God.  What?  How long has Ted Nugent been waiting?  Uh, a few minutes.  I don't like the idea of him waiting and nobody knowing he was waiting.  Somebody could have come in and slipped a little note and said, Ted Nugent's waiting.  What was I just doing?  The signal through the window is like, what?  You did.  You did panic.  That was not panic.  That was panic.  You did.  The Soviets handled that little Russian school takeover better than you two handled this  phone call, and we're not happy. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Let's talk to Uncle Teddy.  Mr. Nugent.  Happy hunting season, boys.  How are you?  There he is.  Hey, where are you right now?  I'm sitting in Crawford, Texas.  Do you have any...  Oh, you don't have any...  Do you have your guns with you?  You think?  Well, remember last time you called the show?  I certainly do.  That's why I love you guys so much.  You're like my ballistic blood brothers of radio.  Oh, he was blasting off some rounds out of some fine weaponry.  And boy, I got some beautiful hardware in the mail this week.  You know, is my American dream perfect or what, guys? 
[02:03:30]  I mean, I get new weapons to test just about every other day.  I'm a lucky son of a bitch.  Ted, did you go out when the assault weapons ban expired and just buy up a bunch of fun  stuff?  No.  I mean, even though the statistics are just hysterical that when Clinton bans certain  types of guns, which...  It was all aesthetics.  It's so laughable.  It's beyond comprehension.  It was all aesthetics.  It had nothing to do with the guns themselves.  It had nothing to do with nothing.  By the way, just for everyone's statistical celebration, the most rounds ever fired during 
[02:04:00]  the commission of a crime in the history of America was the North Hollywood machine gun  bank robbery.  Remember that?  Yeah.  6,000 fully automatic.  Those are real machines.  Those are real assault weapons.  Right.  6,000 rounds fired.  Let's all guess right now, shall we, Opie and Anthony?  How many people were killed that day?  Two.  None.  None.  Well, yeah, two of the bad guys were killed.  Two of the bad guys.  But the point is, 6,000 fully automatic machine gun rounds were fired during the North Hollywood 
[02:04:30]  bank robbery.  Nobody was killed.  Meanwhile, the most dangerous shooting in the history of America was the D.C. sniper.  One bullet per victim.  Hey, Clinton, kiss my ass.  So, bottom line is that more of the banned guns were sold in the following 24 months after  Clinton jacked off on everybody's face.  More of the weapons that were banned were sold in the following 24 months than in the previous 
[02:05:00]  12 years.  Really?  How beautiful is that?  How retarded.  He made a demand for it.  He made a demand.  He made a demand.  He's retarded.  Yeah.  I love that.  Complete demand for it.  Great.  So, meanwhile, yes, I have many, many weapons.  I love weapons.  They're tools.  They're beautiful functioning tools.  And with my guitar, I make such beautiful music.  What the hell?  Are we going to shoot some weapons off this morning?  You know, I can't.  It's still dark here, and Mrs. Nugent actually moved right into Crawford, so I can't shoot  out my window today.  If I was at my other place down the road, I could just blast me on your wildest train. 
[02:05:30]  Who would think we'd hear the word Ted Nugent and pussy whipped all in the same?  Well, no.  There are laws, gentlemen.  Nobody revels like Uncle Ted.  Life is a barbecue with lots of weaponry.  But I can't do it in this neighborhood.  But I will think of you later when I touch off massive rounds for machine guns galore.  Well, you're going to have to call back and do that, because we love when you shoot off  the weapons for us.  I can do that.  I got your hotline number.  You're marked man.  Plus, on XM Radio, you need me.  So, I want to be Captain Obvious today.  Mr. Nugent, who are you voting for in the upcoming election? 
[02:06:00]  Well, seeing as how I'm not a big fan of pimps, whores, or welfare brats, I can't go with  Al Knuts for Sharpton's boy, Johnny.  Isn't that pathetic?  You know, when you actually, I'm in Crawford, Texas, the home of President Bush, and the  Crawford newspaper actually endorses the candidate of pimps, whores, and welfare brats, who actually  aligns himself with the planet of the apes of Ted Kennedy.  Sometimes I want to change the channel. 
[02:06:30]  Wow, the planet of the apes of Ted Kennedy.  I mean, Ted Kennedy is so retarded, and so is his little puppy, Al Knuts for Sharpton.  And, you know, if it wasn't for his helmet, Al would have no redeeming merits whatsoever.  I kind of...  I don't make that of his helmet.  He's got quite a helmet.  You know, the candidate of pimps and whores and stuff, that almost sounds cool.  But...  Like that, you're almost making him sound cool like that.  Except that that's supposed to be entertainment, not quality of life dictated.  You know, I'm in Texas where they think Hee Haw is the educational channel, gentlemen, okay? 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  But there are a lot of make-believe, fantasy, dope-smoking, you know, Grateful Dead soundtrack,  Hee Haw watching, you know, turd-in-the-lip, you know, Hee Haw bonic numbnut retards out here  who still latch their fist to a saddle on an angry bull and then go, I think I hurt my back.  You know, these people are so retarded, it's beyond hope.  So I'm here to teach them how to barbecue, because O.P. Anthony, the Texas barbecue is way too damn white. 
[02:07:30]  And I've got to bring some of that Motar and stuff, too.  All right, here's the deal.  I mean, everyone knows you're a hardcore Republican, okay?  Hardcore.  Let me ask you this.  Is there one thing you like about Kerry?  Like, one thing.  No, his deception and his conclusion that America is too stupid to identify as smoke and mirrors  is so repugnant to even a modicum of intellectual review that I am just appalled at the blue map in America. 
[02:08:00]  However, when you look at the vast influx of blood-sucking illegals in this country,  they really are blood-sucking.  They come here to squirt out children so that they can immediately get the kind of welfare  that even Americans can't get.  But as a country, we allow that to happen.  How about none?  Huh?  You know, it's just pathetic.  It's just Planet of the Apes, guys.  But we do allow so many people to just cross the border illegally.  I mean, you don't think, at this point, it seems like we could take care of that problem 
[02:08:30]  if we really wanted to.  Yeah, I've got six buddies of mine.  We could do it by noon.  You know, that's my biggest criticism of President Bush is the porous borders.  It's absolutely unbelievable during a war on terror that we actually criticize the most powerful  law enforcement tool that is directly attributable to the containment of porous borders, and that  is profiling.  Hell, gentlemen, I profile when I pick a bass player, okay? 
[02:09:00]  I profile when I allow my daughter to date someone.  Who the hell doesn't profile?  Who the hell's coming over to meet you?  Hardcore Republicans.  No, I mean, if I was into your daughter, there's no way I'm meeting you.  No, my daughter, my daughter Star, is happily married.  She's just a wonderful, wonderful girl.  My daughter, Sasha, is in New York City, probably listening to Opie and Anthony right now.  But Sasha and Star were raised with discipline and a sense of independent individuality, 
[02:09:30]  so they were prepared for the dating game way before puberty in that they wouldn't let  numb-nuts and recharge into their lives anyhow.  Keep a stun gun in the glove compartment.  At least.  So if Bush loses this election, what will you, Ted Nugent, do?  Well, I've always been an activist.  You know, I know what we the people means.  I know what an experiment self-government is.  I'm always active in my community, the schools, the church, the politicians all know who I am.  And because I literally travel, I still rock and roll like an idiot every year, 
[02:10:00]  and I travel in every city, in every state.  I hunt in every state.  I do benefits for dead cops and dead soldiers in every state.  So I'm an American.  All those states and all those states politicians, they work for me, and they all know who I am,  and they all heard from me, and they all heard from me on important policies,  whether it's gun reform, gun control reform, whether it's education reform, welfare reform,  justice reform, because there is no damn justice. 
[02:10:30]  It's not a justice system.  It's a legal system.  So I've always been an activist.  So if the numbnuts, if we do become the planet of the apes, and Ted Kennedy has more influence  over his little puppet Johnny, and Al Not-So-Sharpton is actually part of a team that determines  the quality of life in America, my activism will go up a thousandfold, and I will be in  their face beyond any horror story they've ever imagined.  All right.  Wow.  You go to tednugent.com, and you see some of the brilliant wisdom from activists, 
[02:11:00]  from real participants in their communities.  I just got off my website.  We have a talk back in the chat room, and I get on it multiple times every day,  because it's kind of like an electronic campfire where we share ideas,  and somebody from Des Moines communicates from somebody with Seattle,  and we realize that all the concerns for quality of life in the American dream are parallel,  no matter what part of the geography you may be in.  And I'm moved that activism is increasing, that people are becoming more aware of quality of life issues, 
[02:11:30]  that they're more involved with their elected officials, teaching the elected officials that they work for us.  So I think the prognosis is good.  I don't believe Carrie will win.  I believe the pimps and the whores and the welfare brats that are served by the flu map  will maybe even have to stop at the next help-wanted sign and get a real job.  All right.  And no one worries me is this whole religious rite, though, that's going on.  Well, but, you know, I've got to tell you, they're inconsequential.  I mean, I wrote Wang Dang Sweet Poontang, and I meant it, okay? 
[02:12:00]  I mean, nobody's more inebriated on rhythm and blues and rock and roll and the primal scream than Uncle Ted.  But, I mean, I did 100 concerts last year, and I scared more white people with my Birdland guitar  than Yasser Arafat is doing to carp out in the swamp right now.  By the way, I hope he dies slow and painfully.  It looks like he is.  Yeah, good.  I mean, maybe I could piss on his wounds.  Ted, Ted, I've got to ask you something, though.  Don't you think you're pretty right-leaning, let's say, 
[02:12:30]  and me playing the devil's advocate here?  By the way, guys, in order to contest Ted Nugent, you'd have to play the devil's advocate, so go for it.  Well, the thing is, because I agree with a lot of the stuff you say,  so I would have to be playing the devil's advocate.  Indeed.  I wouldn't want anyone to think that it's my idea.  Or you could play the Al Nuts or Sharpton's advocate.  Don't you think that the left, the far left, the liberal left,  feels the same way with the same passion as you feel about your causes, 
[02:13:00]  and they have names like pimps and whores for you guys,  and that the real answer is somewhere in the middle?  No, no, the real answer is not somewhere in the middle.  A moderate would have three people break into their house and only shoot two of them.  I'm going to kill all three of them.  But a liberal would want to discuss it with them and maybe make them a hot toddy  and see just what caused their lean towards criminality.  And after they get victimized, they would figure out what they did wrong to bring it upon themselves. 
[02:13:30]  Yes, but see, it's much more distinct.  There's a gargantuan chasm in the sand.  It's not a line in the sand.  You know, the people like Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi,  and, you know, God bless them and anybody who has the E Street band  and the talent that Jon and Bruce surround themselves with.  These guys got soul.  They're very dedicated.  Their worth ethic is something to celebrate.  But they've become insulated. 
[02:14:00]  They've surrounded themselves with what I call the Elvis condition,  and they've got yes people,  and they intentionally screen discomforting information.  The difference between me and Bon Jovi,  and, again, I think he's a great man.  I just think he's lost,  is that when they see a beggar,  an able-bodied, lazy, stinky beggar,  they would say to their people,  give them $100, see if we can't clean them up.  I wouldn't.  I'd lean down next to him. 
[02:14:30]  Meanwhile, the beggar would use the $100 to buy more poison,  more drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and garbage food,  so that the beggar could die quicker.  But Jon could go back to his hot tub,  and he could feel good.  He would feel good, because he gave them $100.  Meanwhile, I'd lean down, spit in the cocksucker's cup,  and tell him to get a fucking job.  I love this guy.  Wow, yeah.  You know, there's not a fine line.  There's a gigantic chasm of decency and goodwill on the right,  and when they get overzealous with their religious extremism, 
[02:15:00]  slap the shit out of them.  That's what I do.  I mean, I get on stage, and I still go berserk and have the time of my life.  Flames come out of my ass, and the religious right recoils in horror.  Meanwhile, I go, hey, see if I have one of these that'll fit you.  Well, I have one that'll fit you perfectly.  Here's a fuck you for you, you fuck.  He likes the satellite radio.  Yep.  I like satellite radio.  All right, I think you said it all there.  I've got to agree with a lot of what Ted says.  Oh, man.  Hold on, hold on. 
[02:15:30]  I've got to call Anthony out.  You have said that you're thinking about voting for Curry.  I was at first when we were being persecuted.  You don't want to come across a sour like a pussy in front of Ted Nugent.  No, no, no.  Michael Powell, if you can't rein in, Michael Powell's having a little bit of a,  you know, he started his period,  so he can't be held responsible for his spiritual bloating.  You know, we can control this numbnuts so easily.  All we have to do is stand our ground.  And, again, you know, I am... 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the problem is no one stands their ground as far as the FCC goes  and as far as all these special interest groups go.  You know, one stupid special interest group writes a letter.  Next thing you know, Ted Nugent isn't performing that song or performing in that town.  I mean, that's the problem, man.  I can show you hundreds of examples of that in my rock and roll career  because my rock and roll concerts, when you surround yourself with the virtuosos that I do,  you have a career that defies gravity.  And I've got to salute Tommy Clefetto, the world's greatest drummer, 
[02:16:30]  Barry Sparks and Marco Mendoza.  My rhythm section is the Funk Brothers, man.  I'm a lucky, lucky guitar player and son of a bitch.  But the bottom line is when I have run into obstacle courses from the left or the right,  I merely plow forward.  That's why I reference my website.  Go to tednugent.com, go to TalkBack in the chat room,  and witness how we run into numbnut policies and numbnut regulations every day of our lives.  And all it takes is a little bit of grooming.  All we have to do is be reasonably groomed, 
[02:17:00]  confront the numbnuts who are forcing these counterproductive policies on us.  And let's take an extreme example.  The assault weapons ban, the so-called assault weapons ban.  The banning of deer hunting in certain state and national parks where the deer population goes completely out of control,  but all the little lefty, feel-good, bamby retards are demanding these policies.  The Ted Nugent, United Sportsmen of America, steps in,  and we articulate the science and our responsibility for real hands-on conservation and resource stewardship. 
[02:17:30]  And we take policies that have been written in stone for dozens and dozens,  if not, you know, 50 years where no hunting was allowed,  and the deer are slammed by trucks at a thousand-fold the regional average.  And we change that policy overnight merely by getting involved.  I believe that the same FCC clusterfuck that is strangleholding typical radio across this country,  and, again, there's got to be a modicum of decency, 
[02:18:00]  and you can't just let her rip like we are on XM Radio right now on a station that kids can turn on on the way to school.  However, that being said, there is some common sense, decent ground,  and this is where the middle ground must be articulated from the extremist side.  And I consider Opie and Anthony and Uncle Ted and Howard Stern and all these other guys  to be extremists in entertainment and in just articulating a street slang.  But there's got to be some sense of decency that a community determines. 
[02:18:30]  And I have articulated this in front of panels, in front of church panels, school panels,  and if Ted fucking Nugent can do it, who can't?  Well, there you go.  Well, there you have it.  There you have it.  I try the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Ten Commandments, and the Golden Rule,  wad them up in a ball, grease them down, and shove them up their ass.  Wow.  So I've got to ask you, what should we do with Iraq?  Well, we're doing it.  Listen, I was over there.  I went to Baghdad.  Well, you know, the liberals will say it's turning into the next Vietnam. 
[02:19:00]  Well, it isn't.  I mean, I'm not an expert on Vietnam.  I avoided that one.  I was a guitar boy back then.  Yeah, how did you get out of Vietnam?  Well, I had a one-wide deferment.  I was a student at Oakland Community College.  But I went to that one-wide deferment to keep from going.  I didn't understand how it worked.  I didn't understand the horrors of communism.  I was basically a greasy-eyed kid right out of high school,  and I didn't have the faintest idea about how freedom was paved, how freedom was paid for. 
[02:19:30]  And I didn't realize the importance of soldiers stopping evil there so that we don't have to face it here.  And I salute every veteran of every war.  My dad was in World War II in Korea, and I just went over with the USO.  In fact, oh, and if everybody would visit USO.org, what a great organization.  You know, the great history of all these entertainers going over what Toby Keith and David Letterman are doing today. 
[02:20:00]  And I was proud to be a part of that USO tour.  And I was in Baghdad.  I was in Kosovo.  I was in Fallujah.  The road we took to entertain the Marines in Fallujah was blown up the day after we left there.  Was Ted packing heat?  I was packing massive heat.  I had an M4 and a bag of ammo.  An M4 is a small version of the M16.  We were wearing our body armor and Kevlar helmets, and we were right in the middle of the hellstorm.  I was manning a .50 caliber on a Black Hawk and a Chinook, and I shared C-130s with flag-draped coffins. 
[02:20:30]  So I understand how freedom is procured.  I understand how freedom is secured from the hands of evil and monsters like Saddam Hussein.  In fact, I went to the palace in Baghdad, the Punte and Kunte Palace, you know, before we blew their shit to hell.  So I took a good dump in their bidet.  But anyhow, that's a different story.  I went to some insurgent, like going to mine the street or something or launch an RPG, and he looks up and goes, 
[02:21:00]  Oh, my God, I've just been shot by Ted Nugent.  How beautiful would that be?  But I've seen the men and women of the United States Army, the Marines, the Air Force, the Navy, the Coast Guard, and that's what we celebrate every day.  I mean, Shemaine, my wife and I, today, we're organizing a great big Thanksgiving Fennison barbecue for Fort Hood.  And I visit the troops and their families all across the country.  And our charity, we have a Ted Nugent Camp for Kids charity that is now working all across the country to get supplies, food, clothing, medicine, blankets, water, 
[02:21:30]  and Thanksgiving dinners for the troops' families who have lost a father and a husband.  Right.  It's just, it's the least of all.  In fact, I mean, how are we going to wrap this up in Iraq?  Well, we don't want this to go on for, you know, years.  Opie, Anthony, somebody write this shit down, would you?  All right.  I got a pen.  I'm just a guitar player, but here's what we're doing in Iraq. 
[02:22:00]  We're baiting them.  We're baiting all the ala pukes.  We're baiting all the voodoo retards to come get the soldiers over there.  You don't actually have to.  Is this going to be part of the pop quiz?  I think we're recording this.  Voodoo retards.  You know, the ala pukes and the voodoo retards are being baited into the line of fire by the  United States soldiers, and we're blowing the living shit out of them.  Shit.  By the way, what's plan B?  Do you have cliff notes that we could get? 
[02:22:30]  Because I can't write this fast, and I know there's going to be a pop quiz.  No, but I've got a couple of ala pukes that I've actually written in a wood burner on their  forehead all the fact.  Just before I piss on their wounds.  Piss wounds.  Jot that down.  Okay.  All right.  Is this going to be a multiple choice pop quiz?  No, there's only one choice.  Plan A.  Crush evil.  Drive safely.  Oh, very good.  All right.  With that, that's great.  And that's what our guys are doing.  You know, we're setting sniper records every day where our soldiers, our snipers, are just 
[02:23:00]  blowing the shit out of these goofballs.  It's two miles.  How beautiful is that?  You know what?  Look, I'm pretty pro-Bush, and I was pretty for the invasion.  But the more I learn about the Iraqi people, al-Sadr and the rest of them that only rose  up once Saddam was gone, the more I kind of regret going in there and feel we should  have just left them in there and let them continue gassing them, because they're awful.  They have no gratitude.  They hate us.  They're all for the insurgents.  They cheer when Americans are killed. 
[02:23:30]  No, that's not true.  No, no.  Somebody's been listening to Dan rather too much.  I was there.  I went over there.  I went over there.  I performed for the troops myself.  I was over there.  Good for you, man.  God bless you.  And I'm for the military, but I'm really starting to hate the Iraqi people.  Well, there's a lot of retards over there.  Remember, they've never had...  Those are the voodoo retards, bro.  They're voodoo retards.  Those are the voodoo retards.  There's also a whole normal thing going on where they're getting their haircuts again,  and they're listening to music, and they're dancing in the streets.  Yeah, sure.  Here's what the citizens of Kosovo and Kandahar and Fallujah and Baghdad told the old guitar player. 
[02:24:00]  They told me, in many different ways, that because of the United States stepping in,  this is the first time they are not scared to death every day that their daughters are going to be raped and played with before they're tortured and murdered by the Saddam henchmen.  This is the first time in their life that they've actually felt they might try to be the best that they can be,  and they can get their return based on effort. 
[02:24:30]  Remember, the American dream is simply being the best that you can be.  There's no French dream.  There's no German dream.  There's no Mexican dream except to get the hell out of Mexico and go to America.  We don't have to worry about the federales raping in the ass every day.  This American dream is now being shared with the people of Baghdad, and it's absolutely wonderful.  All right.  You've got a few people pissed off.  We've got to give them a little chance here.  A little equal time.  Let's go to Jeff in Buffalo.  Jeff, what do you have for Ted Nugent?  No, I think it's Ted Nugent, man. 
[02:25:00]  I don't get it.  Ted Nugent?  Who's the Ted Nugent?  Ted Nugent.  Excuse me.  Okay.  Who's this?  This is Jeff from Buffalo.  Hello, Jeff.  How's your Buffalo, man?  All right.  Yeah, I don't agree.  You know, these people, I think they're fucked up.  You know, they don't appreciate what's being done.  A lot of them, don't you?  You're right.  And, you know, I just hate seeing the news reports that, oh, three soldiers are dead today,  four soldiers are dead, you know, tomorrow.  And I'm a vet, and I don't know, man. 
[02:25:30]  I think it's all bullshit.  Well, it's not all bullshit, Jeff.  There's a lot of bullshit.  But remember, we've always been inundated by the ABCs, CBSs, and whatever the other one is.  The Dan Blathers and the Tom Brokaw puppets and the Canadian guy.  We have been just bombarded with intentionally misrepresented information.  Jeff, you're right.  It is a clusterfuck.  There are a bunch of morons over there.  There are voodoo pukes.  There are a lot of retards.  Oh, boy.  But, Jeff, there's a whole bunch of positives. 
[02:26:00]  I mean, I was there when a little girl was being saved only because there was a U.S.  helicopter that could get her to a U.S.  doctor in a U.S.  hospital.  I mean, there are anecdotal activities.  And Ted was flying that helicopter, ladies and gentlemen.  No, I was not there.  I was not in the helicopter, but I saw it land.  This happens every minute of every day.  He needs to be a cartoon character.  And Dan Rather will not share it with you.  Ted.  All right.  Let's say hi to Reese in Maryland, who's very pissed off. 
[02:26:30]  Hello, Reese.  Hey, nice to talk to you guys.  Hey, welcome back, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Hey, Ted Nugent, you are the worst hypocritical chicken hawk pussy I have ever heard in my life.  Go, Reese.  You spent your fucking time in Vietnam hiding away at a little community college  when you had the fucking chance to go do something.  You had the chance to back up your big fucking words, you little pussy.  What'd you do?  Oh, I'm in a community college.  Reese, will you ever forgive me, Reese? 
[02:27:00]  I was 17 years old.  Fuck you.  Some of these boys dying in Iraq, you stupid fucking prick.  That's why I went over there to help them out as much as I could, Reese.  Oh, yeah.  Big help.  Yeah, big boy.  Stand around with your M4.  Give me a fucking break, you chicken hawk pussy.  You're worse than fucking George Bush.  Well, suck my dick, Reese, would you?  You don't hear this on Crossfire.  Why don't you come to Maryland and I'll break your fucking hip, you old fuck. 
[02:27:30]  Jesus.  Oh, Reese, how heartless are you, Reese?  Reese, go eat some more tofu.  What'd you do, fucking fag?  All right, there goes Reese.  Wow.  Reese is angry.  I've already dipped my mea culpa, huh?  Suck my dick.  Reese is pretty good.  All right, one more.  Let's say hi to Mark in Oklahoma.  Mark.  Oh, Mark.  Hey, Ted.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe I'm talking to Ted Nugent.  This is too fucking cool.  Hey, Mark.  There's a whole bunch of Oklahoma warriors over there.  I think there were soldiers from every city in Oklahoma when Toby Keith and I went over 
[02:28:00]  there because Toby's an Oklahoma boy himself.  Yeah, I live in the same town he's from.  But, yeah, I just wanted to tell you, I had a good one the other day.  Some asshole neighbor of mine was taken up.  I had about six or seven Bush Cheney signs out on my lawn, and I caught him taking the  signs out, and he was trying to peel a Bush sticker off my pickup.  So I called the cops, and I had his ass arrested. 
[02:28:30]  Good work, Mark.  Well, that's typical behavior of people who represent Al not so sharp and basically thieves  and rapists.  His wife is scared shitless of me because the last week I went to the gun shop and bought  me a couple of AKs because I figured, what the hell, I'm going to try one of those for  a while.  I got tired of my SKS.  Now, wait a minute, Mark.  You didn't actually get a Kalishnikov.  What you got was a replica.  They don't sell Kalishnikovs over here.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not the real, real deal.  It follows 762s, but, you know, I got two of them, and I just love it, man. 
[02:29:00]  I wish you had your own talk show down here in Oklahoma, and I was forced recon in the  Marine Corps, and I would love to come on your show that's Surviving Nugent just for the  hell of it.  Oh, yeah.  Is that show coming back, Ted?  Boy, I was that hysterical.  Number one both times on the Parole Hip Hop Network.  How cool am I?  I loved the Ted Nugent show.  You know, a lot of people don't realize this, and I think it's appropriate.  To announce it on Opie and Anthony, I proudly accepted the Black Redneck of the Year award 
[02:29:30]  after Surviving Nugent made number one for the second time on VH1.  That's Black Redneck of the Year.  Thank you very much.  I'd like to thank my mother.  Wow.  What an honor.  Actually, I was going to get to use Al Nutschel-Sharpen's helmet for a week.  That was my prize, but I'd already had an outhouse.  Very cool.  Let's say hi to Dave.  Dave, I mean, the phones have exploded.  Well, of course they have.  They love Uncle Ted.  Even guys like Reese, he's having his hip to distract you me today, and he thought he'd 
[02:30:00]  blame me.  Dave.  Good morning, Mr. Nugent.  You know, I wish there was more people like you out there.  I get tired of hearing the left always pushing their views.  The Hollywood elite pushing their views on everyone else.  I mean, my wife is a nurse in the service right now, and I just don't understand why  they're pushing their views, telling us what they think's going on, what a lot of stuff  is not currently going on, and we are doing a lot of good.  I mean, I wish you, I mean, you were more, I mean, you're very outspoken. 
[02:30:30]  I wish that, you know, I mean, there's more line light to you, I mean, because you're  refreshing.  I mean, it's great to hear you.  I hope he empties.  Is this Dave?  Yeah.  Yes.  Thanks, Dave.  Well, the truth is a beautiful thing.  I try to offer the truth like a gentleman, but if necessary, I will bend you over.  The bottom line is, to be a conservative, historically, is meant to be very prim and very proper,  and we don't want to be confrontational as we adjust our bow ties. 
[02:31:00]  Well, that kind of spineless soullessness is finally going the way of the dodo bird, because  conservatives have realized that Mr. Rogers and Barney are not good representation for  our side, that the Ten Commandments, the golden rule, the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights  are worth wadding up on occasion, putting on the end of a ramrod and showing it up a bunch  of assholes' fucking butts.  So bottom line is, the conservatives have got to get a little bit tougher.  All I can say is, remember the fucking Alamo.  All right.  I kind of agree, up until you put the Ten Commandments in your wad like that. 
[02:31:30]  I think that's important.  I think you've got to stand up for what's right.  You know, when evil shows up, you shoot them.  What's plan B?  Yeah, I don't like getting the religion mixed up with our politics, though.  Except religion is a misnomer.  What are the Ten Commandments other than guidelines for decent behavior so people can get along?  So when the Jew goes to the synagogue and the Muslim goes to his mosque and the Catholic  goes to his church, we can wave at each other instead of launching rockets each way.  You know, you've got to be retarded. 
[02:32:00]  You've got to be absolutely retarded.  You've got to almost be like Ozzy to not get that.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Now we're going to have a problem.  Well, Ozzy's retarded.  He's a good man, but he's retarded.  Jim Norton loves Ozzy Osbourne.  Man, I love Ozzy Osbourne, but he's retarded.  I can't argue with him.  There you go.  God damn it, I can't argue.  Isn't that horrible?  All right.  Ozzy got high and Ozzy's brain dead.  I went hot and I'm still dead.  Eat me.  Let's say hi to Mike in Philly.  Mike, what's up?  What do you have for Ted Nugent?  Hello, Mike. 
[02:32:30]  What's up, guys?  Gregory, Tony, James, how you doing?  Pretty good, huh?  Fine, thanks.  And yourself?  Hey, Ted Nugent, I've got a question for you, buddy.  Yeah, man.  You're self-righteous and, you know, you preach all this stuff about America and all that.  But weren't you the one, the rock star, like, that used to touch 14-year-olds?  What's this now?  Oh, there was a story that came out.  When the hell was that?  It's like 14-year-old girls.  Wait, who was that girl?  Mike, Mike, who was that?  I have no idea.  I want a specific.  What did I used to do now?  There was some girl that claimed, I believe, is she a celebrity or something? 
[02:33:00]  I think she is.  That claimed that she gave you oral sex when she was 12 backstage.  Yeah, that was just after I butt-fucked a gopher.  Your cop-out was, oh, I like pussy, you fucking self-intro.  Yeah, that's a cop-out.  That's quite a cop-out, first of all.  That was a dirty lie.  Do I like pussy?  You think?  And when I was 15, how old did you think my girlfriends were?  Hey, Mike, fuck you. 
[02:33:30]  Fuck you.  Wow.  Hey, Mike, Mike, let's not be too harsh.  Ted, what was she wearing?  Yeah.  She was wearing Mike's condom.  I think we have time for one more, unfortunately.  It's Scott in Tennessee.  Scott.  Scott, happy barbecue season.  Hey, Uncle Ted, what's up?  I'm rocking.  Hey, man.  I just think, you know, I believe in what you're saying.  I came from a conservative background in Ohio, but it's like even my grandfather before he died, 
[02:34:00]  he said, this isn't the Republican Party that I used to vote for.  That's right.  We've become a bunch of crybabies.  I mean, we need somebody like you who can get on the media to come out and say that this is bullshit, man,  that you people in the religious right need to just stick a sock in it for a while, man.  Well, you know, there's a lot of that going on.  You're seeing a lot more.  There's only one type of effective politics in America today.  Everybody knows this who's not asleep, and it's called confrontational politics.  That doesn't necessarily mean saying, fuck you, Mike. 
[02:34:30]  It obviously means standing up for what you believe in.  I'm using street slang on the Opie and Anthony show on XM radio because I can.  This is how I talk to some of my shit kicker buddies down at the welding shop and down at the feed mill.  And this is the bottom line is that when I was over in Kosovo, when I was in Baghdad, when I was in Fallujah,  I talked to Marines who were putting their lives on the line.  And you know what they say to Ola Pukes just before they blow them up?  Fuck you.  And that's a workable thing.  And when hippies and queers and idiots used to hand me dope and make fun of me because I wouldn't smoke their dope and turn into a zombie, 
[02:35:00]  I'd go, oh, really, how does fuck you sound?  I use street slang in an effective manner.  But when I speak to children as a DARE officer and when I testify before a Senate subcommittee hearing, I speak appropriately.  When I talk to my grandmother, I speak appropriately.  But when I'm in the heat of battle, I speak appropriately as well.  I'm not a little child, and I don't have to talk like Mr. Rogers to get my point across.  There's some real self-evident truth out there.  And when I speak to my camp for kids and when I teach children how to be conservationists and turn down drugs and get rid of tobacco and alcohol, 
[02:35:30]  that drinking and driving and puking and dying is not a party.  You can't talk like some kind of conservative Barney saying, well, just say no to drugs, kids.  Fuck you.  You're asking those kids to get in trouble if you talk to them like they're retarded.  All right.  That's how I operate.  We wanted to leave, but this guy is really pissed off.  Chris, what's up?  Real fast.  Real fast, Chris.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Not fast enough.  No, no.  Hold on.  I screwed up.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, OEA and A. 
[02:36:00]  Great to have you back.  I can't believe I'm sitting here driving to work.  I can't believe I'm listening to these crazy rednecks talk like this.  It's none of our business.  Believe it.  We should have been there in the first place.  We have no business being there.  And why do they have to be put under our regime?  What if some of the country doesn't like what we're doing?  Should they come here and come after us just because they feel like it?  All right, Chris, get back to the traffic.  You're going to hit somebody.  Opie, Anthony, can I respond to Chris?  Yeah, of course.  Sure.  Hey, Chris, you know, there's a global community out there.  Most of the people in the global community are retarded. 
[02:36:30]  They still chop off little girls' clitorises over in Nigeria as some government-sanctioned  religious rite of passage.  They're retarded.  When your neighbor is getting slaughtered by a bunch of retards, at some point, a decent  neighbor will stand up and help that neighbor.  We didn't do so in Rwanda because the U.N. wouldn't let us save those three million dead  Rwandans.  We didn't do it in Somali.  We didn't do it in the Sudan because the U.N. was jacking off.  So, meanwhile, somebody at some point, his name is George W. Bush, and men and women 
[02:37:00]  of the U.S. military saw innocents being slaughtered, and we finally said, this is enough.  We're going to go stop the monsters.  Fuck you.  Ted?  Yeah?  You've got to admit, though, that kind of wasn't the battle cry that was given when we  went there.  Well, sure it was.  We're going to go get Sudan.  We're going to bake the voodoo pukes over there.  Listen, guys, there's no, I want to hear, plan B. What are we going to do?  Be more sensitive?  What are we going to do with the U.N. so we can wait while more be slaughtered?  Meanwhile, it's not just innocents being slaughtered over there, guys. 
[02:37:30]  That's where they train terrorists that come and blow up Americans.  There's no plan B.  Yeah, but it's kind of been proven also that there really weren't many terrorist training  camps there when Saddam was in charge.  He ruled with an iron fist.  But we're in their neighborhood.  We are right in the epicenter of where Muslim retards are being trained.  We're over there doing it.  We don't have to be in their building.  We don't have to be in their neighborhood.  We are in their region, and the American good guys are baiting the retards so we can 
[02:38:00]  blow them up there so we don't have to face them here.  I know that line, Ted.  I have not heard a reasonable plan B.  Saudi Arabia.  How about going after Saudi Arabia?  We're right there, aren't we?  That is Saudi.  We are over there.  That's where we are.  But most of the terrorists came from Saudi Arabia that blew those planes into...  We're as close to in their face as an experienced military strategist could be. 
[02:38:30]  Meanwhile, John...  We got too much business interest with Saudi Arabia, so we're not really messing with them  too much.  Well, but once again, where are our troops?  We are in their face.  There's no plan B, guys.  Well, the plan B is kind of, you know, inviting in the rest of the international community  to...  The international community are retards.  Fuck them.  You got to admit, though, the Saudis, we do...  And this is not Republican.  This is Democrat-Republican.  We do have kind of business interests with the Saudis that does prevent us from doing what 
[02:39:00]  we have to do, which is sever all ties with these fucking animals.  Yeah, there you go.  Well, you know, bottom line is there's a bunch of other...  You know, we can't really do this in a quick interview, guys, but are Americans gluttons  or are we gluttons?  We couldn't suck down more raw crude if we wrapped our lips around some Saudi prince's  ass and just breathed in for a lifetime.  We do love our crude.  But that's why we have Alaska.  Let's just go go to Alaska.  There's nothing going on there.  I got a shovel.  Let's go.  He's first in line. 
[02:39:30]  No doubt about that.  Hey, before we let you go, so we got the story in front of us.  Perhaps the voters of Michigan will need to be reminded that Ted Nugent received a handjob  from a 14-year-old Courtney Love many years ago.  Oh, it was Courtney Love that claimed that?  Not even close.  No?  Not even close.  But it says a handjob he's openly admitted to having occurred.  Not even close.  I've never met that scab in my life.  Damn, you mean like...  You know, if you and I did that much drugs, we'd talk like that, too. 
[02:40:00]  She's retarded.  She really doesn't make that credible of a witness.  You think?  You think?  You mean everything I...  Are you trying to tell me everything I read in the papers isn't true, Mr. Nugent?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, and El Nugent's hair is real.  Hey, Ted, you're always...  I don't know.  You always give us great radio.  Always get the audience a little riled up, Ted.  Well, you know, there's a lot of sleepy little fucks out there like Reese in Maryland.  This guy lost his dick in a terrible fence.  I hope XM Satellite Radio gets smart and hires you, man, because I would love to listen to you every day. 
[02:40:30]  Well, I've been offered all kinds of gigs, but I've got hunting season.  I've got kids at camp, man.  I've got Spirit of the Wild TV on the Outdoor Channel, number one show on the Outdoor Channel.  Well, then maybe we'll just put you on our show every once in a while.  I'll tell you what, I've got your hotline.  I'll call you in and put my crowbar to your party.  This is what you have to do.  You have to call us back sooner than later with your weapons.  I can do that.  Like last time, all right?  Oh, literally, guys, I've got a beautiful Texas whitetail hanging in my cooler, and I've got blood off. 
[02:41:00]  I've got to go clean the blood off all my knives.  I'm getting venison for a big barbecue for the soldiers at Fort Hood, and I'm going to kill all kinds of deer this week.  And so as the sun comes up and I'm handling carcasses, I will be thinking of you, and I'll try to give you a call back,  because I want to rile some activity, some activism, some involvement,  so that people all around the country help the troops and their families, because they really need it now.  All right.  Thank you, Ted.  Thanks, Ted.  All right, guys.  Bye, Ted.  Happy Thanksgiving, man.  You too, buddy.  There he goes.  Ted Nugent.  Ted Nugent.  Never disappoints. 
[02:41:30]  Wow.  The people just freaking out now.  Jim from Boston, I guess talking about the Saudi Arabia question that was posed to him.  Why don't we go into Saudi Arabia?  And Ted's saying, well, we're there.  We're in the area.  He says, by Nugent's reasoning, we should have invaded Britain during World War II,  because we were close to Hitler's army in France.  Very funny, Jim.  And the Nugent is an idiot with his head in the fucking sand.  We went in for weapons of mass destruction, and because we were told that Al-Qaeda was there, 
[02:42:00]  neither was proven true, and he's changing the facts post-invasion.  Asshole.  And another guy wondering, does Ted tell the animals he kills, fuck you, before he shoots  them?  Probably.  You've got to admit, though, even if you're liberal, it's just refreshing to have a guy  like him, because he's really honest.  He really speaks.  It's like Hollywood and entertainers are 90% liberal.  You guys have all of them.  Conservatives have so few guys like that that are ballsy and not corn balls and that speak 
[02:42:30]  out.  So come on.  For how silly and ridiculous he sounds to some people out there being so far to the  right, when you listen to a liberal on the left talk, excuse me, I'm sorry, you sound  the same.  It's crazy.  I don't agree with everything Ted says.  I agree with some of what he says, and then there's some bedwetting liberals on the left  that I don't agree with, but there's a couple of things I agree with on them.  That's why I'm saying somewhere in the middle, Ted doesn't like moderates. 
[02:43:00]  Ted is an all-or-nothing kind of guy.  I got the handjob.  I didn't get the handjob.  Not, I got it until a little clear stuff came out.  You know?  He's an all-or-nothing kind of guy.  That's true.  A moderate wouldn't have taken a handjob.  Right.  He would have just ate her box and sent her home.  He got the handjob.  Come on.  How could he not?  I mean, Jesus.  That little drugged-out vixen, I hope he got one.  Who's going to turn down?  You know she developed those tits at 12.  Yeah.  He signed her flat bosom, and the little N in Nugent went over the nipple, and then he 
[02:43:30]  got a handjob.  Good boy.  I do believe he got a handjob from a voodoo retard.  I love him.  Ah, voodoo retard.  Or was it a voodoo puke?  God, I hope there's not a pop quiz.  He's out of his mind.  But the liberals got to stop screaming.  We have so few guys like that that have balls on our conservatives.  We really got to move on, because we still have so much to do on this show today.  We got Sully from Godsmack checking in.  Oh, good.  Is he going to spout off about his political views?  I don't know.  I just love listening to the guy.  I don't agree with, you know. 
[02:44:00]  He's crazy.  But he's well-spoken, and liberals are usually smarmy, and oh, he just goes right after  him.  I love it.  All right.  In honor of Ted Newton calling the show today, we haven't played this in a while.  We got George Bush reciting Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  This thing is amazing.  Some guy just found the words to Sunday, Bloody Sunday in George Bush's speeches and put this  together.  Check it out, and we'll continue.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song.  This song is Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  I can't believe the news today. 
[02:44:30]  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long?  How long?  Must we sing this song?  How long?  Too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Broken bottles under children's feet.  Bodies turn across the dead in the streets. 
[02:45:00]  But I won't heed the battle call.  It puts my back up, puts my back up, is the law.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  How long? 
[02:45:30]  How long?  Must we sing this song?  How long?  Too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Sunday, Bloody Sunday. 
[02:46:00]  Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember.

[02:53:00]  Heavy on politics today.  Anyway, for the last 45, 50 minutes.  Tomorrow, lesbians.  Lesbian couch.  Tomorrow, lesbians to balance it out.  We like balance on the O&A show.  How exciting.  Our first lesbian couch.  A little heavy on politics, so we're going to lighten it up tomorrow with lesbians.  The girl's coming in to have her first lesbian experience.  Yes, Ben.  Jim's been talking to her online, I heard.  Yes, I have been.  You're unbelievable.  Which girl's coming in for the lesbian experience? 
[02:53:30]  The Radio Shack girl is coming in.  Okay.  And remember Taylor from Philly?  Oh, my God, Taylor.  Is she coming in?  Yeah.  We love Taylor from our Philly days.  Very good.  You know, it's funny.  You said heavy on politics, which is I read a couple of instant feedbacks.  Not many.  Maybe two.  That one guy was like, what is this, the Rush Limbaugh show?  Like he was upset that, yeah, that exchange between Ted and Reese was exactly like something  you'd hear on Rush Limbaugh. 
[02:54:00]  I always hear Rush interviewing guests and telling them, fuck you, as they ramble on.  I wish we had our Rush Limbaugh music.  You idiot.  We could see how that would sound, Rush Limbaugh cursing out callers.  But anyway, yeah, so tomorrow.  Sometimes you just don't understand what these people want.  Well, that's why we try to balance it out, you know?  We'll get the lesbian audience tomorrow, Anthony.  And also John Valby coming in tomorrow as the show gets more gooder every day.  I'd like to hear some sex today, but I don't know if it's going to happen. 
[02:54:30]  We're trying to get more couples involved with the sexiest state in America.  So far, Illinois is taking the title.  You never know.  Maybe by the end of the show, we'll get a couple going at it.  Oh, what's this?  Oh, perfect timing once again.  Could you turn that up a little bit there?  The Excellence in Broadcasting Network, the Rush Limbaugh program.  Fuck you, my battle cry to the Democrats.  A little late now.  Thanks.  Thanks for trying.  Rush Limbaugh's music really stinks. 
[02:55:00]  I know.  I'm so hip with the kids.  I understand, and I take narcotics just like the kids.  And I listen to the young people's music, like this 20-year-old tune.  It's 1984, actually.  I was just going to say that.  Learning to crawl.  The last time Stalker Patty had her vag examined.  Who is that, by the way, Rush Limbaugh song?  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  The Pretenders.  Awful.  Why would I know that?  My City was gone because it was on the radio when we were growing up, over and over and 
[02:55:30]  over again.  As I was just telling you, open the restroom.  I know what a Britney Spears song sounds like, but I don't listen to the crap.  Yeah, but if you heard it, you might not remember it in 20 years, like what it was called.  Why not?  You just wouldn't.  The Pretenders were a great band.  Sorry, they're not Aussie, but their first record.  I accept your apology.  Their first record was a great record, Jim, but you wouldn't know that.  No, I don't know what their first record was.  Sorry.  I accept your apology.  Like it was sincere.  I love that.  I listened to your guys' music, and I was just telling you, I was on the radio, I listened 
[02:56:00]  to the radio yesterday, and the hoop came on, and I'm like.  Let's stop talking when we take our leaks together.  Why?  Because it's uncomfortable.  Wow.  And you stand a little too far from the urinal.  So what?  Listen, we were discussing music and docking.  We were docking a little bit.  You don't have to.  They have that partition in the way, that marble partition.  Or as I call it, the fun blocker.  You know, because we only break like once an hour at this point.  Yeah.  So this is what people should do if they're used to listening to regular radio.  If you didn't like about 10 minutes of that Ted Nugent thing, just picture 10 minutes 
[02:56:30]  of boring commercials.  Of commercials.  All right.  So then eventually we have to go take our leaks and stuff, and so we all pile into the  bathroom together, and then we discuss the segment, and then Norton has just a little  small talk going on.  But he's just a little too far away from the urinal.  I don't get that.  We all hold each other while we're taking a leak in one big line.  Yeah, a little competition.  Remember yesterday?  You had a little more, but I guess it's chillier.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  A little shake.  So then Norton looks at me.  He's like, I don't get it.  I don't get that you guys like the who. 
[02:57:00]  All pissed off.  Dude, because I know you guys are big who fans.  What song did you listen to?  I listen to it.  I know everybody's exasperated when I say that.  I'm on the radio listening.  Who are you?  And I will say that they're great musicians.  I listen to the drumming.  Keith Moon was one of the best drummers of all time.  I agree.  Neil Peart, number one, always.  I'm listening to Moon.  I'm like, this is a great band.  But they just are un...  Oh, here you go.  Hoo, hoo. 
[02:57:30]  Hoo, hoo.  Ugh.  Well.  It stinks.  This is a...  You know, it's a song for the time when it came out.  What about Bob O'Reilly?  We'll get fooled again.  Naked Eye.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  515.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Tommy's rock opera eats my ass.  It's no No More Tears.  Yeah, no Crazy Train.  Not my favorite...  No, you're right.  It's not a Crazy Train.  Crazy Train is a great song.  It's a phenomenal song. 
[02:58:00]  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  It's no When I Closed My Eyes Forever.  That's a lovely ballad.  I'll give you that one, too.  Not good.  Dude, Ozzy ate it more than the Who.  Oh, this is a good one.  Ozzy ate it more than the Who in his stupid tunes.  You better, you better, you better...  Wait, wait.  You better, you better...  You bet.  You bet.  You bet.  It stinks.  Bosco, are you better, you better, you bet.  And everything that Ozzy put out was great, right?  I'm not saying that, but Ozzy doesn't get the respect that the Who gets.  Sabbath doesn't get the respect that...  Ozzy gets respect. 
[02:58:30]  Not like the Who.  The Who is overrated.  Ozzy is not.  The Who is overrated.  Very overrated.  The Who is one of those legendary bands that go hand in hand with the Stones, because they  came from that time.  I know.  And the Who is actually still out doing things.  The Stones.  As old as they are.  The Who is nothing.  The Stones, I mean, the Stones, I can understand.  The respect comes from the longevity.  And that, even Sabbath can't match.  I know.  The Who is around black and white TV.  I know, but I'm talking about my generation. 
[02:59:00]  That was innovative back then.  Talking about my generation.  Name one Sabbath album that comes close to who's next.  Sabbath, bloody Sabbath, Sabotage, Paranoid.  At least he meant to stumble and stutter in that song.  At least he was doing it on purpose.  I'm like Ozzy, just trying to carry on a fucking conversation.  Beastie Boys rip off Black Sabbath with the Sabotage.  Sabotage?  You know what?  No, Sabotage was a great album.  Well, he's trying to say that YouTube ripped off Black Sabbath. 
[02:59:30]  I'm not trying to say it.  I am saying it.  They have a song called Sunday Bloody Sunday.  I am saying it.  They did.  It's not even close to the same song as Sunday.  The event that took place in Ireland was called Bloody Sunday.  I know.  They're documenting that event in song.  It has nothing to do with Ozzy.  You're absolutely delusional.  Ozzy.  All right.  Enough with the Ozzy.  I'm so sorry.  I'm just talking about the Who.  When Ted Nugent made fun of Ozzy, I thought Jim was going to jump out the window.  Nah, because I know Ted probably knows him.  It's like me goofing on Voss.  Steven Kelly.  What's up, Steve? 
[03:00:00]  Real fast.  Steve.  Oh, shoot.  Hold on a minute.  Oh, shoot.  Well, watch that language on Satellite Open.  Sorry.  I thought I was on the Donna Mike show.  Hello.  Steve, what's up?  Ben, you guys are messing yourself up.  Go back the way it was.  Run the bitch into the ground.  Do the shit she used to do.  That's what made you so great.  Now it's like three duches sitting around discussing politics and, you know, which time  of day they changed their co-text.  Dude, we just had a break with Ted Nugent.  What are we supposed to do?  Throw tits into that? 
[03:00:30]  There's enough awfulness on this show.  What?  Every day.  Oh, just a break shit.  You know.  Oh, my God.  I'm hanging up on Steve.  I mean, Steve, first of all, I broke shit yesterday.  If that makes you happy.  That's what floats your boat.  I actually broke computer equipment yesterday, which is going to cost me.  We haven't talked politics that much at all because we found our own angle.  Getting Ted Nugent to talk politics is much more exciting.  We got the lesbians.  I mean, shut up.  Yeah, Jesus.  Three weeks.  This is the fourth week. 
[03:01:00]  You've already broken something.  You can't make everyone happy.  You know, Ant, it's like my dad used to say.  You can please some of the people some of the time and the heck with the rest.  And we'd all laugh, you know, with the little twisty.  Because it was supposed to end the other way.  Right, right, right.  But we're like, oh, dad, you.  Ho, ho, love you, boo-boo.  All right.  So what do you got there?  Can we get back to sucking?  Sure.  What do you got there with the-  Oh, I have a wonderful story about-  I could make Jim very uncomfortable right now.  Why?  Someone just sent in some feedback. 
[03:01:30]  And they took a listen to Man Cow today.  And Man Cow is claiming that he discovered Jim Norton.  Oh, there you go.  Man Cow.  Calm down.  You had the chance to bring Jim on your show.  And you chose not to because it's all about you.  And then when you didn't do that, you decided to try to hire all our people behind the scenes.  So shut up.  Although I would say discovering Jim Norton is right up there with saying,  I found the first case of ball cancer.  Bob, the trucker.  What's up, Bob? 
[03:02:00]  Hello.  How you doing?  Good.  What's going on?  Well, I just listened to Man Cow coming out of Chicago until you guys come on.  And it was bad-mouthed you.  Andrew was telling him about Norton, I guess, is his good buddy.  Supposedly Man Cow's good buddy.  Andrew?  Yeah.  Dice.  Dice is on Man Cow today?  Dice.  Okay, so?  And they was bad-mouthed you guys.  They was talking about Man Cow.  He said he got everybody started in that radio business. 
[03:02:30]  Who was bad?  Dice was bad-mouthing?  No.  Man Cow.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Man Cow's got to calm down.  Did he say our names, Opie and Anthony?  Yes, he did.  There you go.  Thank you.  Another commercial in Chicago for XM Satellite Radio.  Thank you.  Discovered.  He had the chance to hire Norton.  Norton came in with Dice, and we went, holy crap, we want this guy on our show,  so we made him part of our show.  You know?  The same thing with Anthony.  Anthony used to do radio all over the place, and I said, oh, my God, 
[03:03:00]  this guy's great at doing radio, so we decided to work together.  All these other stupid idiot DJs had a chance to hire someone like Anthony  and hire someone like Norton, but a lot of these guys have these huge egos  where it has to be about themselves, so they don't hire guys like Anthony  and Norton, because they have to be the ones that have all the laughs on the  show and stuff.  So, God, whatever.  Jack off.  What's up with the Boston thing?  This is a cute little story out of Salem, Massachusetts. 
[03:03:30]  Just another story of a fun-loving Red Sox fan.  A Staten Island couple's dream of a perfect wedding at a Massachusetts inn  turned into a nightmare.  You know, a couple from Staten Island, they go to Massachusetts, an inn in Massachusetts,  probably planning this thing out for years.  You want the perfect wedding.  What about an inn in Massachusetts, honey?  An inn?  That sounds so romantic, doesn't it? 
[03:04:00]  Much better than one of those wedding factories.  Right.  These people put some thought behind it.  A country inn.  A country inn in Massachusetts.  Bed and breakfast.  Fall time, the leaves, the colors.  It's perfect.  I believe it's called the foliage.  What could possibly screw this wedding up?  Perfect wedding at a Massachusetts inn turned into a nightmare when a Red Sox-loving  busboy got drunk and chanted, Yankees suck, Yankees suck, and threatened to beat up the 
[03:04:30]  groom and guests, according to police in Salem, Mass.  Unbelievable.  They wanted to celebrate their just-married status at the Hawthorne Hotel in Salem on Saturday  night.  But their night was ruined when busboy Derek, L-O-J-K-O, is that J silent?  Would his name then be Loco?  Derek Loco got increasingly drunk.  Go figure that one out. 
[03:05:00]  And increasingly belligerent to the wedding guests, all of whom were from New York.  He was going around drinking and yelling, Yankees suck, Yankees suck, because he knew we were  from New York, Peter Mercury said.  It was bizarre because the Red Sox beat the Yankees three nights before, and I'm not even  a baseball fan.  The guy didn't care.  Several wedding guests tried to intervene, but Loco kept drinking, and his bosses at the  hotel did nothing about it. 
[03:05:30]  After the reception, Loco banged on the hotel room door of Mercury's sister-in-law and cursed  her out.  The groom said, she was so scared she ended up spending the night in the happy couple's  room.  Now the honeymoon's wrecked because of this idiot.  Can you imagine that I had my sister-in-law in my room on my wedding night?  Lucky boy.  A lot.  Mercury said, that's probably the biggest reason I want compensation.  When Mercury, still in a tuxedo, confronted Loco, the busboy threatened to, and now let 
[03:06:00]  me quote, bring my boys over here and kick the shit out of you motherfuckers.  Come on.  Go Sox.  Go Sox.  An off-duty Salem police officer overheard the threat and intervened, finally ending Mercury's  Salem trials.  Kind of like the old days.  What a guy.  What a guy. 
[03:06:30]  The host tell, or this guy Loco, hasn't commented.  The happy couple, Peter Mercury and his beautiful new wife, are thinking of getting a lawsuit  together.  And a man identified himself as Loco's brother, said they declined to comment.  That's classic.  You got to comment.  This guy, they show a picture of him.  He is the epitome of an ass.  He is every one of Ben's friends from Boston, first of all.  He is everybody I've seen on TV jumping on top of cop cars, reveling in the Sox victory. 
[03:07:00]  He is everyone in the stands at Fenway holding up stupid signs with their painted face.  He's wearing a white cap with a green shamrock on the front.  Drunken, babbling idiot.  I got an update, Anthony.  It's up to 21 arrests in Boston.  21?  That's it?  That's all so far.  And how many dead?  So far, none dead.  Well, only one so far.  Only one girl dead.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Very good.  Okay. 
[03:07:30]  Those socks.  So we were on the John McEnroe show.  Oh, remember when we were starting?  I remember when we started this break.  I didn't know you guys did that until I listened to Don and Mike yesterday.  Oh, good golly.  Oh, good grief.  Our first talk show appearance, and it was very exciting.  Yes, we had a lot of fun.  And there's DJs out there trying to be a buzzkill, but you know what?  When it comes down to it, we had a great time.  You're not killing my buzz.  John McEnroe was a great guy.  A lot of fun with him, and we got to see an old pal backstage, Dee Schneider. 
[03:08:00]  And Dee's going to come in and do our show to sing the full version of the Nambla song,  by the way.  Oh, remember when he sang the Nambla song?  He wants us to sing the Nambla song.  He wants us to get a choir together.  Get a little boys' choir to sing the Nambla song.  How fun would that be?  That is going to be hilarious.  You know what?  Well, soon enough, when these little clunky desks are all cleared out, we can have some  bands come in.  Would that be great?  Fantastic.  When this floor is cleared and it is nothing but our stuff.  Also, we found out that Kreskin was on John McEnroe recently, and I want to challenge  Kreskin. 
[03:08:30]  Fraud.  I want to challenge Kreskin.  He's good.  I'm going to challenge him, though.  Oh, he's good.  The wacky handshake.  I like that.  It's like, are you a psychic, or what do you predict?  No, no, I'm a mentalist.  He's a mentalist, and he does that handshake that you want to punch him in his big, thick  glasses.  I'm also a mentalist, Anthony, and I want to challenge Kreskin.  Oh, really?  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  I've got to go.  I've got to be a press conference.  Kreskin.  I know.  Where is it?  Ah, make a left.  A few blocks.  Who are you talking to from the press?  Well, they're here right now. 
[03:09:00]  I'm doing an interview.  Oh, Kreskin, who?  We'll have to explain that another day.  Some people.  We've got to get to this John McEnroe audio.  He's a vague ass.  It's big Yassa Arafat glasses he wears.  I want to take him on, though, Anthony.  Yeah.  I want to do the taint.  Oh, really?  I want to do the taint thing with Kreskin.  Now, I know that Opie can discern a woman's age merely by gazing into her taint.  I don't believe that.  It's true.  I think he's guest lucky.  He's not.  He's 100% on about eight girls.  100%.  And why don't we try to get Kreskin on the phone?  I want to see if he's willing to come in and take me on, Anthony. 
[03:09:30]  All right?  Mentalist.  So here's the John McEnroe audio.  We'll stop as we go along here.  Oh, let's listen.  Let's listen in to us on John McEnroe.  Your pal's walking onto a talk show.  Aw.  Tonight on McEnroe, Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Bad Boys.  All right.  My first guests rocked the radio world so hard they got kicked off.  Now they're back on XM Satellite Radio with absolutely no decency standards.  Please welcome Opie and Anthony. 
[03:10:00]  You gave the wave.  Oh, playing the, uh.  Yeah, Paul Schaefer was playing radio.  Oh, no.  It was John McEnroe.  I thought it would be, you know, how Paul Schaefer gets the music that.  Playing radio.  Compliments who's coming out.  Who does that?  Joe Jackson?  I was going to say Elvis Costello.  Elvis Costello.  I always got them confused.  Yes, sir.  I didn't see this, but I want to think if Opie did.  Did he do, like, the phony, like, smile and point at someone in the audience? 
[03:10:30]  Oh, like, you know someone?  Hey.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Damn it.  I would have done that.  As you're walking.  It's almost like when you're walking on stage, you have to look back towards the curtain like you're talking.  Like, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going.  Oh, excuse me.  I got a show to do.  Yeah, we'll continue with that thought.  We'll continue this chat.  But I got to do a little something over here now.  Like, you're so busy.  You're chatting, doing talk shows.  Did you do that when you came out of the curtain on Leno?  No, I was just, I just walked out, but I did do the lean-in during the break, and this is what I said.  You obviously didn't have a mirror in the wings to fix your shirt before you went out there.  No, no, no.  It's not what I want.  It was all blowing in the wind.  You had a collar way up and to the side. 
[03:11:00]  Really?  That was me waltzing out to claim what was mine.  You were.  But it's not about me.  What did you lean in to say during commercial?  Hey, thanks for coming into the dressing room and talking with me.  You really relaxed me.  That's what I say.  You said that?  Yeah.  That's what you say to somebody who just gave you a handy.  I know.  You really relaxed me.  No, here's what you say.  Thanks, Courtney.  Can you keep a secret?  Let's continue here. 
[03:11:30]  So, what's up?  No decency, no decency standards.  We're a perfect match.  Are we allowed to curse on this?  Well, if you feel, go for it.  Yeah, we may have to bleep it a little bit.  Oh, really?  If you feel better, you know.  That makes you feel relaxed.  We had enough cursing all day on our radio show, now without any restrictions.  But I actually heard you, because we talked earlier, I was on your show earlier, that  you're actually pulling back a little bit.  We're trying.  We're trying to control ourselves.  You know, I've heard that in interviews that we've done.  It's like, yeah, we're pulling back from the cursing, but he's every two seconds, the  F word.  You say the C word, though. 
[03:12:00]  Talking to my mother.  Wait a minute.  You hung me out to dry.  I don't curse as much as you do on this show.  You curse more than I do.  I am absolutely standing by that.  You curse more than I do on this program.  No way.  Absolutely.  I'm still using the initials.  Nope.  Most of the time.  You curse more than me.  I did use the C word today, which was a little awkward.  Ben, who curses more on this show, Opie or me?  Besides you.  I don't curse that much.  Oh my God, you curse.  The first day I did when I imitated the guy from Belfast.  So what?  You're always doing an imitation of some profanity spewing idiot. 
[03:12:30]  You say ten words a day, and seven of them rhyme with bunt.  Opie curses more than I do on this program.  Jimmy?  You're here every day.  I curse as the most.  I don't curse as the most.  You go on tirades where you link together the airport about 500 times.  Well, that's when something's going wrong, though.  No, no.  I will absolutely stand by this.  I curse less on this program than you do.  Take away when I'm not being an ass.  It doesn't matter.  Technically.  Our regular show, I'm just kind of hanging.  No, I'm not going to take away anything. 
[03:13:00]  I'm saying you curse more on this program than I do.  You hang me out to dry a lot.  No, I do not.  Because now in all these interviews, you're blaming me on the St. Pat's thing, the mayor's  prank.  You came up with the St. Pat's prank.  You did.  The mayor's prank.  What do you mean I came up with that?  The mayor's prank.  I did come up with the mayor's prank.  And I didn't write the list.  I had nothing to do with the list of the places.  I don't know who put church on it, but it wasn't me.  And I would assume that, you know, Stinky wasn't in charge of the show.  Nope.  So I think someone had to write it down.  I'm just speaking the truth here.  Why is everyone pointing on me? 
[03:13:30]  I don't know.  Because maybe I happened to be in studio that day, and I saw Ben going, dude, don't fuck  with the church.  They went crazy last time when you suggested it.  Ben, the voice of reason.  We should have known we were screwed.  And, uh, and Ope's been insisting.  All right.  I'll, uh, I'll give something away today.  We never said this in an interview.  Oh.  The list was there.  Yeah.  And we, as a show.  Yes.  At a church.  Yeah.  And do you remember what I said to you just before the Rage Against the Machine music started?  As we're putting our-  Hang on, Jack. 
[03:14:00]  As we're putting our headphones on for the last time.  Hmm.  Almost the last time.  This will get us fired?  I said, this was off mic.  I go, Anthony, don't mention that church is on the list.  Oh, right, right, right.  I do remember that.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And I remember you looked over at me and went, I want to mention it.  You go, you better not, you better not, you bet.  All right, relax with the ho.  Back to the audio.  Little did we know old fat-lipped Mercurio is out there, ready to ruin it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[03:14:30]  Ready to ruin it for everybody.  Oh, no.  Guys, tell the folks what happened to get you kicked off NEW a couple years ago.  Well, we decided to do a cute little contest called Sex for Sam, and that was where we  had couples have sex all over Manhattan.  Various landmarks, important New York landmarks, like the Statue of Liberty.  They're horrified out there.  Empire State Building.  Yeah, that was the funny part.  We're trying to explain, you know, all this crazy, edgy crap, this shocking stuff, and  these people were looking at us like, you guys really are the scourge of society. 
[03:15:00]  Horrified.  It was not an audience full of Opie and Anthony fans.  See, that would have been cool.  If we could have planned this ahead of time, we could have bust our own audience in, and  then we would have looked like heroes.  But instead, these people were like, you guys are disgusting.  Horrified.  Old housewives.  They were like Tony Danza's audience and crackheads.  That's pretty much what we had.  And what they would do is go around the city and call up.  They'd have spotters with them, and the spotters would call us up and say, our couple right  now is having sex at the Hard Rock Cafe in Midtown Manhattan. 
[03:15:30]  And we'd look at the list and go, ooh, five points.  And they would continue on to these locations, and the more popular the location, the more risky  the location, the higher the point value.  And unfortunately, one of the locations on the list was a church.  There's any church.  Now, that could have been anything.  Church is fried chicken, perhaps.  It was.  I don't know.  But all of a sudden, it was St. Patrick's Cathedral, right?  The couple decided to go to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  You know, not that well-known to church.  And from there, it was downhill for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:16:00]  Don't forget about the two-point conversion, Anthony.  How are we going to explain that?  There was a two-point conversion.  Right.  You get the point value of the location itself.  So a place like St. Pat's, which was very risky, was, I believe, 20 points.  But, oh my God.  Sorry, Mom.  But if they did the sexual act in an alternative fashion, it was an extra three-point. 
[03:16:30]  Thank you, whoever clapped.  I know what he's talking about.  I see people that are psyched and people that are completely disgusted.  Sometimes they call at the back door, John.  You don't even just go to the style.  We're talking about the limit past that in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  We're always trying to find, yeah.  So I'm guessing then that when this happened that you guys knew you were in a little bit of trouble or no?  Right away.  Right away.  You have to be a complete idiot to not think you're in trouble. 
[03:17:00]  Because you guys are number one here.  You're syndicated number one.  We had markets all over the country.  We were doing much too well for us to continue it.  Yeah.  We had to blow it up.  And you got fired by infinity, right?  Actually, we got canceled.  They couldn't fire us because, I don't want to get into technicalities.  Did you still get paid?  Yeah.  Because the broadcast itself wasn't indecent.  Go figure that one out.  The way we worded everything on the air was perfectly acceptable and well within FCC guidelines.  So they couldn't fire us. 
[03:17:30]  So they just kind of sat us on the sideline.  They didn't want us going to another company.  So you got paid for a couple years.  Two years.  Yeah, two years we got paid to sit down and do nothing.  It was a legal.  It sounds great at first.  Tony Danza, applause break.  Did we just get an applause break?  Who was trying to get an applause break?  It's like, yeah, we sat and did nothing.  All right.  Well, that audience, they would love to be paid to sit and do nothing.  Yeah, they have crackheads.  They have to stand in line to get paid.  Where I could get this kind of job, mother? 
[03:18:00]  Where I could get this job?  Yes, Jimmy?  I just wanted to know if next time you guys do TV, could you tape the audio from the TV  instead of putting a recorder in your pocket and then playing that?  Yeah, right?  It's a little tinny.  It's a tinny.  Yeah, exactly.  A little tinny.  Well, we don't have a production studio all week.  Oh, that's right.  I think this was done at Steve's house or something.  Yeah, this is real audio.  Come on.  You're just like, what do I do?  You used to be maybe 18 years old.  If you're out of work, you have a lot of friends around.  They're not doing anything either.  They're bums, you know?  But when you're an adult and you're supposed to be working, you can't just call up your 
[03:18:30]  friends because they're working.  They have jobs.  So you must have been going absolutely crazy then before you get the satellite gig, right?  Without a doubt.  I spent the time playing golf with old guys.  That was the only people available.  That doesn't sound too much fun.  No, it sucked.  It was awful.  You'd think the fantasy is to, you know, go to the beach with your friends, drink beers,  hang out with the hot babes.  But no, the only ones available were senior citizens.  Retired guys.  Yeah.  Retired guys.  So, look, I'm assuming that you regretted doing that. 
[03:19:00]  Or is it actually taking you to a place that maybe you wanted to go and it all worked out  in the end?  Or both?  It's kind of strange because we sat on the sidelines for two years.  We loved doing radio.  So, in that regard, yeah, of course we regret it and we know it was morally wrong.  But in a strange way, it made us bigger.  You know?  I mean, you wouldn't be talking to us today if we didn't have the sex in St. Pat's thing.  So, kind of like you said 22.  What an important interview.  Isn't this everything we said 800 times in every newspaper and every other TV thing 
[03:19:30]  we've done?  Yeah, pretty much.  I know.  God.  You'd think someone would find another angle.  Yeah, we're going to have to come up with something new.  22, you know?  You ask people, you know, do you know who Obi and Anthony are?  And they'll say no.  But then you go, oh, you ever hear that sex at St. Pat's thing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The scourge of society.  Right.  So, tell us about this satellite thing then.  Because, I mean, now...  It orbits the Earth.  It orbits the Earth.  We have to put space too far.  There's absolutely, am I correct, no decency standards whatsoever. 
[03:20:00]  You can do absolutely anything.  Except for human decency.  Yeah, like human sacrifice would pretty much be frowned upon by management.  I would think so.  But language, things like that, whatever we want to discuss, adult subject matter,  everything's a go.  We don't have to dance around words that we used to have to, you know, tiptoe around.  We can talk about anything right up front.  And I'm assuming that you think this is the wave of the future.  The wave of the future.  The future is now, or the future?  The future is happening as we speak. 
[03:20:30]  We're the pioneers of satellite.  We are the innovators.  We are the guys.  Believe it or not.  Did you see what happened yesterday with Stern, where he called in?  I know you guys have a bit of a feud.  Is that fair?  Yeah, we hate each other.  He's kind of a hypocritist as far as how he handled us when we worked for the same company.  We worked for the same company.  We both worked for Infinity Broadcasting.  What did you say about you guys?  Well, we were getting quite popular in New York, and he didn't like that too much.  So he went to the bosses, and he told the bosses to tell us to stop talking about him. 
[03:21:00]  So we had a gag order.  We weren't allowed to mention Howard Stern on our show.  So to see him now yelling and screaming about freedom of speech and all this with Michael  Powell, the SEC, and censorship, it's kind of a joke as far as we're concerned.  I'm amazed the guy that pulling in about a half billion dollars is making pretty much  what amounts to prank phone calls to radio stations.  Calls up, hey, Michael Powell.  You've got Prince Albert McCann.  We'll be right back with Opie and Anthony. 
[03:21:30]  See, I mean, the commercial came at the wrong time because Anthony was ready to go off with  the 10-pound balls, a bowling alley.  Calling prank calls.  You've got 10-pound balls, how do you walk?  Although it's such a strong language, I mean, like, Ant doesn't mess around.  When he said the tiptoeing thing, I'm like, whoa.  We're tiptoeing around it.  Let me tiptoe.  A lot of instant feedback coming in. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  And I swear to God, don't make me go on Wackbag.  The Wackbag people have been instant feedbacking us a lot.  Yeah.  Very involved with the show.  They comment on it a lot.  And they're probably the most uber-critical out of everybody.  And you could just go and you could add this to my fuck yourself.  Do you realize that McEnroe is the lowest-rated show in history?  Yes, Justin from Wackbag, you idiot.  We said that.  Do you think it's like, do you think that's news? 
[03:22:30]  Hey, guys, do you know the McEnroe?  Really?  Well, I thought it was the highest-rated show.  What an idiot.  Of course we know.  You're not telling us anything new.  It was still good to do.  It was fun to do.  We had fun.  A lot of people, well, a lot of people didn't see it because we were also competing against  the World Series and the Red Sox winning the World Series for the first time since 1918.  But you know what?  My family enjoyed me on TV last night. 
[03:23:00]  Guido Hitman from Wackbag.  Insert canned laughter.  Sympathy claps.  The horror.  That we told you what the audience was.  The audience was crackheads.  We were in front of an audience of crackheads.  It wasn't sympathy claps.  They were sleeping.  These people weren't even conscious.  As we went to commercial, I leaned over to John McEnroe because I was kind of horrified  after looking at the audience for six minutes.  I go, John, where did you get your audience from?  We said this earlier.  He said, well, we bust them in from Rockefeller Center. 
[03:23:30]  But I meant, where do you get your audience from?  Like, holy crap, look at these people.  Where do you dig them up?  Spend a little more time making, I don't know, Photoshop pictures and fun, cute stuff like that.  You've got to comment on everything.  Every little thing.  I feel like William Shatner.  Get a life.  William Shatner on that Star Trek bit on SNL.  My God.  It's weird.  This is, you know, we're doing everything.  Today we're going to be talking to the Chicago Sun-Times. 
[03:24:00]  So that's fun.  We were in the New York Times, you know, Sunday.  This is all about what, you know, what we're doing.  Yeah, but you guys were wrong before.  It was too political.  And now you're talking about McEnroe.  You just can't make people happy.  If you talk about tits too much, people complain about that.  All right.  Well, let's continue with our first talk show appearance.  Got to start somewhere, Anthony, right?  Yes, we do.  The show's still being broadcasted all over the country.  I was quite proud.  It is.  And I'm just wondering if it's being broadcasted, is right, or it's being broadcast. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, well, I don't know.  I've had that discussion before.  I'd like to have it later in a motel room.  I speak awfully.  Do you know something?  In the dictionary, it's listed both ways.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  It says broadcasted or broadcasted.  I just...  I like broadcasted.  Couldn't get a definitive answer, but broadcast does sound like the way it's supposed to be.  Like, maybe...  I think broadcasted would be past tense, like, Opie broadcasted from Long Island when he  was a younger, svelter lad.  But now, we are being broadcasted in the present and future.  If you really want to get me instead of that... 
[03:25:00]  I thought you were going to make it funny.  I'm...  Don't have a whole discussion if I have a speech impediment, because I say but instead of put.  But?  Yeah.  When I'm speaking fast, I'll say but.  What?  I've never heard that.  Oh, these crackheads on the websites have noticed.  Is that what she was saying before?  We were at the urinal, and he said, Jim, put that in my mouth.  And I'm like, what?  Shut the fuck up.  What?  I know it's put.  I've never heard that, though.  I didn't catch that either.  You'd think we'd have ripped that apart if we heard it. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, they're obsessed with it.  You change a beat, you put a beat.  Does Opie have a speech impediment?  And he says but instead of put.  I know it's put.  Uh-huh.  So what do you enjoy?  Do you enjoy eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches?  Take the penis out of your mouth, and maybe you'll say it right.  They notice everything.  I also can't say street the right way.  How do you say it?  So I'll throw that one out there for you, too, so you can mock that for the next month. 
[03:26:00]  I kind of shh my S's when it's S-T.  Well, I didn't even notice that when you said D. Schneider before, and it's a hard S-N-Y.  I didn't say D. Schneider.  You certainly did.  It is Schneider.  Yeah, Schneider.  D. Schneider.  He sings, we're not going to take it, and then he goes and fixes Mrs. Romano's toilet.  Shut up.  Hey, Mrs. Romano.  Shut up, shithead.  We're back at Radio 5.  Opie and Anthony.  You're a sadistic F. 
[03:26:30]  See, you can relate to that.  You're a sadistic, man.  Yeah, we're explaining because he was re-showing the video of Steve-O getting pelted by McEnroe's serve.  Yes, yes.  That's why when we came back from break, we're like, you're a sadistic F.  We were watching that one.  Opie, first of all, and Anthony over here.  Yeah, some people ask.  It's like, okay, which one is Anthony, the Italian, and which one looks like the kid from Andy Griffith's show?  It's not really hard to figure out.  Oh, by the way, to explain, that was Steve-O on our show a little while back. 
[03:27:00]  And Steve-O was on your show this morning, right?  Yeah.  What was he promoting?  You're trying to explain, like, satellite radio.  See, you did that on TV.  What he did for us today was, I'll try to keep this clean for TV.  He took some duct tape.  It is cable, so you can go.  Okay, he dropped his pants.  He dropped his underwear, unfortunately.  We didn't need to see that.  And then he wrapped it up.  The whole package, I mean.  Oh, everything.  Everything.  And then.  Twigs and berries, as they say.  Yeah, exactly.  And then counted to three and tore it off. 
[03:27:30]  You should try to get it on some cable TV show so people can see that.  Well, we film everything.  Oh, you do film everything?  We film everything, and we put it up on our website, so.  Yeah.  Did I say audience reaction?  Did I say put or put it?  Put.  We put it up on our website.  There it is.  There it is.  See, I'll acknowledge it.  At times, I can say but.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it?  No.  His name is Luca Prozzi.  But?  Yeah, these guys love the fact that at times I don't say put.  Let's hear it. 
[03:28:00]  Cable TV show so people can see that.  Well, we film everything.  Oh, you do film everything?  We film everything, and we put it up on our website.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, let me say.  I didn't even notice.  And we put it up on our website.  We put it.  Put it.  Bully, more wine.  Put it.  What are you, a dance judge?  You enjoy Rocky?  Bully!  Put it.  Put it.  People that are supposedly our fans love the fact that I can't say that word. 
[03:28:30]  But I can say it.  Wow.  But for some reason, I'll say it that way.  Oh, they're just being shilly.  Like so.  Yeah.  We're very interactive.  What's your website?  In case people want to check it out.  Rocky and Anthony.com?  I should have known.  We make it easy.  Yeah.  How long have you guys been working together?  Ten years.  Ten years.  Started on Long Island for a short period of time and then got a job up in Boston.  And we got fired from Boston.  Yeah.  Go Sox.  Go Sox.  What did you do there to get fired? 
[03:29:00]  Opie came up with a great April Fool's gag.  April Fool's.  And you know how...  What do you have to tell everybody?  I was conveying the story that Opie came up with an idea.  But they didn't need to know that.  You could just say, well, it's something we did.  I don't know.  Because I think people look and see you and think, you know, you would be the nice boy.  You know, the rube women that are in the audience are probably like, he's probably such a nice boy.  I bet the other one corrupts him. 
[03:29:30]  And you want to blow up my spot?  Yeah, just kind of.  And, you know, and the most important thing, it was your idea.  Well, we had to do something that day.  That's true.  What did you do there to get fired?  Opie came up with a great April Fool's gag.  April Fool's.  And you know how radio guys love doing those April Fool's gags?  Hey, look out your window at noon.  You'll see a meteor.  And we figured, let's just take it to the limit and end the whole thing.  So Opie goes, hey, I got a great idea.  Yeah, let's say the mayor, Mayor Menino of Boston, was killed in a fiery car wreck. 
[03:30:00]  That's a great idea.  But it's like, yeah, it's hysterical, isn't it?  If you knew our show, you knew, you didn't come to our show for hard-hitting news.  And you didn't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Old gag alert.  Old gag alert.  I'm trying to figure out which one's been done more.  The don't go to CNN for dick jokes or sex in a mosque.  Which one of us has the record for the most used old gag? 
[03:30:30]  Well, the sex in the mosque is a new one.  New?  I've gotten that printed in about five or six.  Dude, it's two years old.  I've gotten that printed in five or six articles already.  And you can always change CNN to Fox News and update it.  Oh, I could.  You don't go to Fox News for dick jokes.  Oh, although if you're Bill O'Reilly, you sure do.  Kevin Meaney's We Are The World bit seems fresh compared to those two gags.  Well, it's new for somebody out there.  Yeah.  Or hard-hitting news. 
[03:31:00]  And you didn't go to CNN for dick jokes.  You did it twice?  No.  He replayed it.  No, I didn't.  I shut up.  I did not.  What's wrong with you, Ant?  Did you replay it?  I don't say blay.  It's put.  Put.  It's put.  Come here, boobie.  Put your tongue in my mouth.  When you were a caddy, would people ask for their butter?  I'm right.  Hard-hitting news.  And you didn't go to CNN for dick jokes. 
[03:31:30]  Again?  I heard you said that, Anthony.  No, I think you're replaying it.  You can't rewind cart machines.  Cart.  Carts.  Cart machines.  Cart machines.  Yeah, put it on the old Victrola.  Because it was pretty much known.  So when we said the mayor was killed in a car crash, we didn't think anyone would believe  it.  But the mayor was very mad, said his family had been listening because they always listened  to, I don't know, rock stations that 18-year-old kids listen to.  For their news. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, for their news.  And we got in a little bit of trouble about a week later.  They escorted us to the Connecticut state line and said, please don't return.  And then we ended up getting a bigger job in New York City.  Yeah.  Go figure.  And now you're doing the satellite thing, which is probably going to prove to be biggest  of all, right?  Do you guys fight a lot?  I mean, do you guys get pissed off?  No, you would think, but we really, you know, we don't.  It would make a good story if we did.  I don't think we spend enough time with each other to really fight.  As soon as the show's over, I go my way, he goes his way.  Because we live pretty much two different types of lifestyles. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  We say that all the time, and people think that's a gag.  I know.  And I barely hang out.  No.  We do the show, and he goes, you know, we make a couple of phone calls.  I go do my thing, he does his thing, and, you know, that's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Leave the show.  Yeah.  Maybe, you know, later on at night.  And the reason is because he hangs me out to dry a lot, so I'm getting quite offended.  I don't hang you out to dry.  Maybe I'll just do my part of this stupid show. 
[03:33:00]  I'll put a smile on my face every day, and then write it as long as I can, and then I'll  move on with my life.  Oh, gee.  I'm just telling people how things happened.  No.  We do talk on the phone a lot, though.  Yeah.  You know, we have one of those phone relationships.  Yeah, we have a phone relationship.  It's like, you want to hang out?  That's a negative, Rafter Man.  What are we supposed to do?  Hang out?  What was that?  What movie was that?  The Beatles in Hard Day's Knife?  They all lived in the same place in the movie? 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we're supposed to do that.  Two bunk beds?  Yeah, bunk beds.  One has an O, one has an A.  Hop up.  Good night, Opie.  Good night, Anthony.  Good night, Ant.  Nice.  Don't let the pet pugs bite.  I brought this upon myself.  I just want to acknowledge that today.  I put myself...  Oh, man.  I put...  You put yourself out there.  I put myself in the bucket myself.  Spill from Jersey. 
[03:34:00]  Could you have Opie say,  Beater, Biper, Bick, DeBecca, Bickle, Beppers?  I usually say...  They're going to bash you.  It's all right.  He's, you know...  You guys are married or have kids?  Well, he used to be married.  Oh, yeah.  Somehow, big...  Didn't work out.  Well, I started making a lot of money,  so I figured I'd get a divorce and get a young girl.  That's what everybody does.  Does anyone here in the audience...  Don't clap.  Does anyone here have satellite radio? 
[03:34:30]  Oh, there you go.  A couple.  Rich is our first guy.  I love the...  All right, hold on.  So what does that take...  Johnny Griswold from Philly.  He says,  I love the cringe moment that's coming up.  McEnroe snaps at the audience for clapping at Anthony  for mentioning that he dumped his wife for a young chick.  That was so uncomfortable and great.  What was he doing there?  He just said,  Don't clap.  Yeah, he did.  Why?  He might have been saying,  Don't clap for the satellite question that was coming up.  I don't know.  Did he seem upset by the idea that you would do... 
[03:35:00]  That I would do something like that?  I don't think you...  No, why would he?  And that I was joking about it?  Oh, you were really joking, though.  Come on.  You're going to hang me out to dry.  Let's get into that a little bit.  It's a little joke.  Yeah, because everything was just hunky-dory before that, Opie.  I don't think you...  Yeah, it would have been great.  I'd have left anybody because I was having such a grand old time.  Actually, you would have left for a grandma at that point.  Please.  So I guess you're right.  Yeah, at that point, you would have went to the senior citizen's home for a better relationship. 
[03:35:30]  Believe me.  All right, I'm with you, man.  Yeah, I walked out of a little slice of heaven.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Stop.  No, you make a point there, my brother.  Don't clap.  Don't applaud.  I wonder what he was doing.  I just invited the boy over to take some pictures of him.  He was 14.  He was a Ferris Bueller fan.  Don't clap.  Don't clap.  All right, we'll try to get to that story.  It's not bad to save some stuff for tomorrow. 
[03:36:00]  So what does that take to get?  Because what is it, like $10 a month or something?  How difficult is it to get it?  Because if people wanted to get your show...  It's quite easy, actually.  You go to Best Buy, you buy a unit, and then you subscribe to...  What does that unit cost?  Everywhere from $50 all the way up to a couple hundred.  You could also listen online.  Doesn't this sound all of a sudden we're defensive?  Like, what does it cost?  Well, there are many different models.  Yeah, I know.  Many things must be discussed. 
[03:36:30]  Well, I was trying to turn some of the crowd on to XF Satellite Radio, and I was looking at them like...  Yeah.  So what does that cost?  Maybe you, sir, could steal one.  Well, our Iraqi policy must change.  We must bring in people from the world community.  That's exactly...  I looked into the audience.  I'm like, man, these guys can't afford Satellite Radio.  $50?  $50?  Yeah.  What's your top $50?  It's like, maybe some of the undesirables could steal their own unit.  And I love how little we know about the technology end of this. 
[03:37:00]  Like, Macro asking us what it costs and what's the difference between the units.  We just put on the show.  We make the sound that comes out of the radios.  I don't know how they're built.  I don't know what they cost.  I don't know how they work.  We just put on the little show that comes out of the speaker on it.  I don't know this radio.  I don't know what it does.  Tell him you don't want to use it anymore.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  Can I get a drink or something?  All right.  Back to the audio.  To the mafia.  You can also listen online.  So if it's $50, that doesn't get as good reception? 
[03:37:30]  No.  Not as many bells and whistles.  Not as many stations?  No.  The hardware just gets fancier and fancier.  You get as many stations no matter what kind of unit you have.  How many people subscribe to XM Satellite?  2.6 million subscribers.  Which translates to, do we know how many people, I mean, you knew exactly how many people listened  to your show when you were on N.E.W.  Do you know how many people listen now, actually listen?  We have at least 100 people. 
[03:38:00]  The horrified look in the audience.  They just introduced the MiFi yesterday, which is a portable, wearable, you know,  satellite device.  That's like a Walkman.  It's like an iPod, pretty much.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's going to revolutionize the whole industry.  You don't have to carry your car around with you everywhere you go to listen.  Right.  It's like convenient.  So you're going to go against, you're now on at 6 to 10.  Correct.  Does that mean you do it like, I don't mean to mention Howard's name again, but he often  goes over 10.  Do you guys keep going like 10, 15, 10, 30, 10, 45 if you want?  We're not stupid. 
[03:38:30]  10 o'clock, we're out of there, man.  Pay me half a billion, I'll go until 3 in the morning.  Now, we can go as long as we want, but so far, we like just getting off the air at 10  and going home and sleeping.  You got any stunts up your sleeve for either this show or coming up in the very near future  you could share with us?  We talked to your producers and we suggested a lot of things, but I guess we're not allowed  to do them on CNBC.  We want to do the Whiffle Ball Back Challenge.  Whiffle Ball Back Challenge.  That's great.  Don't tell me you know what that is. 
[03:39:00]  I know.  Whiffle Ball Back Challenge.  You hear the applause break for Whiffle Ball Back?  This is where they edited us.  Something you don't hear on Danza?  We got a heavy edit here.  Oh, we described the Whiffle Ball Back in a little more detail.  A lot of detail.  And then we did a whole thing on Guess What's in My Pants.  We're trying to get the raw audio of the show because we explained the Guess What's in  My Pants to John and the audience and they were pretty much horrified.  Completely horrified, yeah.  That in a glass case, beautifully displayed in the studio and sometimes young ladies who usually  do it.  It's amazing. 
[03:39:30]  The ones that really like doing this are in the porn industry.  Do you do anything, besides the interview we did, do anything nice?  We talk politics.  Anything nice?  Anything nice?  Nice?  Yes, we do.  As a matter of fact, we do a Christmas promotion that helps the homeless.  We get a bus full of liquor, let them indulge all they want, about ten homeless guys.  We give them about 200 bucks a piece and take them to a nice mall like the Short Hills Mall  in Jersey or Roosevelt Field Mall out on Long Island and let them shop.  And it's amazing how many gates come down so early in front of the stores when these guys 
[03:40:00]  come and just come to shop.  That is very thoughtful of you guys.  I think it's very thoughtful.  Let's hear it for Opie and Anthony.  Opie, good luck with it.  Thanks, John.  Anthony, good luck with it.  That's all right.  Keep some ass.  When we come back, a really hot chick will teach me how to work with my stick and balls.  And there it is.  Our first talk show appears.  That was fun, man.  Ian.  Yep.  From Philly.  Ant, great look with the black jeans.  Where's your Chess King shirt? 
[03:40:30]  Three for 99 bucks, faggot.  See, I'm glad Ian put a little more thought into what I was wearing than I did.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Why does a guy care what my clothes are?  Did you notice my shoes?  You faggot.  Calling me a faggot?  That was funny.  All right.  Hysterical.  Chess King.  That is funny, though.  Very good, Ian.  That was a pretty good one.  Why don't we take a quick break?  At a boil.  Is Sully gonna call, you think? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, they just called.  The rumor is Sully's still up from watching the game.  Nice.  Oh, all of them up there in Boston.  Cool.  Sully from Godsmack in just a bit.  Come on!  Woo!  Booyah!  Check this out!  Raw!  I kick it!  In the hizzy!  I kick it old schoolie!  Duh!  Word up!  Hey, jerk face!  Hey, jerk face!  You feel me?  Waka waka waka!  Boop that bitch!  Yeah!  How much ass does that kick?  How much ass does that kick?  East side.  Hoodie!  Let's do it! 
[03:41:30]  Hoodie!  These boobs rock!  Josh!  Is anyone menstruated?  My nipples are hard just thinking about it.  Has everybody gone crazy?  Hahahahahaha  engagement  energy  tactics later  GoB and Anthony show 
[03:42:00]  All my days, I've lived with my disgrace, I'm afraid to show my face, or at least take  off my underwear, see I was born like a halfway neutered pet, I don't have a matching set, 
[03:42:30]  it's a part of me that just ain't there, please don't stare.  Well, I'm a gambling man without two dice, I'm like Uncle Ben with only one grain of rice,  oh, to have two testes would be so nice, but I'm half a man, yeah, I'm half a man. 
[03:43:00]  Wanna die, and it'll just call it quits, I can't find a cup that fits, and at baseball games  I feel so dumb when I hear, oh my god, how could you have been so cruel, to give me one 
[03:43:30]  family, Joe, and the one that's there must feel so sad, he's a lonely man.  Well, I'm a marathon runner with just one leg, I'm a fallopian too, with just one egg, oh, I want  another testy, do I have to beg or be half a man, yeah, I'm half a man. 
[03:44:00]  Well, I'm a tweedledee with no tweedledong, and I'm a siskel and a ebert with just one thumb, 
[03:44:30]  thumb, and I'm a yo-ho-ho with no bottle of rum, I'm just half a man, yeah, I'm half a man.  On the Opie and Anthony Show, we're going to make fun of people with Down Syndrome.  I just didn't want to be in the middle of the flight and have him yank that handle hoping  candy comes out and blow the door off the plane.  We all get sucked out except for him because his head gets stuck. 
[03:45:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, running out of time, but on the phone, one  of our old pals, Sully, lead singer of Godsmack.  Sully, what's going on, bro?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, man. 
[03:45:30]  Are you sick of hearing that song?  Yeah.  I figured you would be, man.  But hey, man, it's nice to hear you guys back out.  It's about time.  We only had to sit out two years this time.  Oh.  You know, we're in the penalty box for that long, huh?  Why isn't my mic on?  Oh, hold on.  There we go.  There's Anthony, and we got Jim Norton, one of your favorite comedians in the studio.  What's up, buddy?  What's up, brother?  Dude, you guys were so phenomenal the other night.  I got to tell you, thanks for the tickets, and I hadn't seen you live since I've known 
[03:46:00]  you.  Like, I saw you at OzFest years ago or with Ozzy somewhere, and it might be the best live  performance I've ever seen given by a band.  Yeah, best live performance that didn't involve Ozzy for Jim Norton.  Dude, I love Ozzy, but Ozzy doesn't sing as well live.  It was fucking phenomenal.  Yeah, Norton was just out of his mind after he saw you, Sully.  He ordered all the albums, I think.  Ben's getting them for him today, I believe, so.  Well, thank you very much.  Yeah, God forbid he goes out and buys them and gives you a little money there, Sully, right?  I already have them anyway, but I want them all as a collection. 
[03:46:30]  I was telling him about the acoustic album.  I really love the acoustic album, too.  Yeah, it's doing well.  Yeah, I hear that.  It's bringing in a whole new demographic.  Now when we do, like, an acoustic show, it used to be 80% guys, 20% chicks.  Now it's, like, 80% chicks, 20% guys.  Oh, they love the acoustic.  Wow, man.  Staying to have this figured out from the beginning.  We're trying to do that with our radio show because it's a sausage factory every time we  do appearances.  We really got to, like, figure out a softer side of us.  We'll do an acoustic show.  Yeah, we'll do an acoustic show. 
[03:47:00]  You're seeing a lot more lighters from the stage, huh, Sully?  Yeah, there's something cool about it, but there's something depressing about having  a sausage party, you know?  Yeah, it's not cool.  What happened to you the other night?  We wanted to say hi to you after the show.  We're in Jersey?  Yeah.  Yeah, I had a boat, man.  I had my family with me, and my daughter was a little sick, so we ran out.  Yeah, Norton was really bummed he wanted to...  I was cool, man.  I understood.  Yeah, I called him, though.  I called you.  Yeah, right on.  All right.  I get so emotional.  So did you see the game last night, obviously? 
[03:47:30]  What?  You see the game?  Oh, dude, are you kidding me?  I haven't missed a pitch since this whole season started.  You guys just going crazy up there, man.  It was unbelievable.  Come on.  But you know what's funny, man?  Did you not feel the same thing?  Like, you know, whatever, whether you're a Red Sox fan or a Yankees fan or whatever,  but I felt like it was more intense beating the Yankees than it was actually winning the  World Series.  A little anticlimactic, especially since it wasn't even close.  The Cardinals were a bunch of pussies.  Who are you kidding? 
[03:48:00]  They brought nothing to the table.  Nothing.  Well, there's that whole, you know, jealousy with the Red Sox.  I'm sorry to say.  I don't want to piss on your parade now that you're the world champion, Red Sox.  But I don't know.  There's not just a rivalry.  I think the Boston Red Sox fans always felt a little jealous of the New York Yankees.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I mean, listen, it's the only team that we could just never beat.  Yeah.  That's why it was so crazy.  I mean, I went, my body went through every emotion that the human body could possibly 
[03:48:30]  go through during that series.  Yeah.  It was intense, man.  When did you realize that you guys were actually going to beat the Yankees?  Did you have that confidence in, like, game two or three?  Or was it actually game, I mean, the second or third victory or game seven?  It was game seven.  Last pitch.  That's when he thought it was going to happen.  No, no, no.  Most Red Sox fans.  I'll tell you what, man.  I didn't know when it was going to happen.  But after we were down three to nothing, I was like, oh, man, we're done.  And then they won a game.  We go, oh, we're not done.  And then they won another game.  And I went, oh. 
[03:49:00]  Here we go.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Game seven, man, I had an ulcer.  Yeah.  Brutal.  You guys got the job done.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  All our Boston friends are calling today and we're like, congratulations on the Boston  Red Sox victory.  Like, everyone had a part.  Yeah, like you guys had something to do with it.  They're all handing out rings.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just cool.  You know, hey, like I said the whole time, I have never even been a big baseball fan.  I'll be honest about that.  But you know what, man? 
[03:49:30]  It was history in the making.  It's been 86 years.  And I'm just so happy that they did it, you know?  Yeah.  I just think it's so cool, man.  I love to see events happen like that.  I don't even care about the sport.  I don't care about it that much.  Well, now you guys got the Pats, too.  My God.  They took care of my Jets on Sunday.  Come on with it.  And I had no problem saying that live in Jersey, either.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, you're such a...  You know how to play to the crowd.  You are a showman.  I gotta tell you.  You know, you don't have to comment, but let me just say this for everybody out there. 
[03:50:00]  I mean, Godsmack.  Anthony and I love Godsmack and all that.  And Metallica was unbelievable, without a doubt.  But I'm telling you, man, you blow James Hetfield away as far as interacting with the crowd.  Don't even comment.  I understand.  You guys have been on the road with Metallica for a year.  I'm not looking for a reaction, but I gotta say it for everybody.  I mean, you just know how to work that crowd in between songs.  It's just unbelievable.  It really is.  Well, I will tell you this thing.  You know, it was funny. 
[03:50:30]  The band was talking about this a few shows ago, and we came through Canada, and we haven't  been up there that much, so the people aren't as familiar with the music as they are in the  States.  And, you know, it's a little bit tough sometimes, because you're trying to get the sing-along  thing going, and it's just not happening.  But we did Quebec City, man, and it was on fire.  And I remember going, wow, like, this was one of the best crowds we've ever played to,  and they didn't even know the music that well.  They were just so passionate about having the show there and this and that.  And I remember thinking, I go, you know, I'm really getting comfortable to that point 
[03:51:00]  where, like, I don't really fear any audience, and I'm getting a lot more confident of doing  what I do and just, you know, knowing how to get them up or whatever.  Except for New York and L.A., man, those two audiences are very jaded, you know?  They're just...  Yeah, you better show me, you dick.  Yeah, they get five shows a week, and, you know, they're sitting there with their arms 
[03:51:30]  folded, waiting to say, I don't care about your band, you guys stink, I want to see James  Edfield.  Right, right, right, right.  You know, and it's like, oh, man, will you just lighten up and have a good time?  Dude, let's back up a second, though.  How fucked up is it that you go to Quebec, and you guys are playing, and they're singing your  songs back to you?  I mean, we remember you guys from the beginning, obviously, when we were doing the Boston radio.  I mean, do you sometimes stand on that stage like, I cannot believe it got this big?  Yeah, yeah.  I know you had confidence in what you were doing in the band and all, but still, you're 
[03:52:00]  in Quebec, and they're singing your songs back to you.  Yeah, it is.  It's still very surreal for us, you know?  I mean, we learn something new every day, and the cool thing is, is touring with bands  like Metallica and stuff like that.  You know, I honestly prefer to just be headlining and do our thing, and for the most part, we  usually do, but when an opportunity like this comes up, it's a really, not only is it cool  for us, because we grew up listening to Metallica, but, you know, we learn from these guys.  I mean, they've been out for 20-plus years, man, and just when you think you have it down, 
[03:52:30]  you start touring with a band at that level, and you're like, oh, wow, that's how they  do that, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, this is how you argue with each other.  Yeah.  All right.  So, you know, it's been a really good experience for us, and thank God, like, their fans have  really embraced us, because even James had called me up, and he's like, man, you are  the first band ever, and he goes, I swear to you, this is true, that it's open for us  that hasn't got booed or has stuff thrown at them. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah, no, you compliment each other great, but I got to say one other thing, too.  First drum solo at a concert that I sat through and enjoyed.  Usually, we talk about this on the show.  Usually, you go to a rock show, and they go into that drum solo crap.  A good example is when Van Halen used to do it, that was time to go get a beer and  go get your concert t-shirt, but that drum thing you guys do near the end of the show  is just unbelievable, man.  No, I would stick around for Michael Anthony's bass solo. 
[03:53:30]  Well, yeah, they worked the bass solo into the drum solo.  Stop!  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  How presumptuous.  I mean, this drum thing is unbelievable.  Is it on the DVD?  Because I'm only halfway through it.  Oh, okay.  It's actually featured on it, and we're trying to be, I heard it's been submitted for a Grammy  for Best Rock Instrumental.  Wow.  Yeah, it's just, it'll blow your mind, man.  Without a doubt.  They play a little 21-12.  I mean, they do a whole interaction thing. 
[03:54:00]  It's great.  The DVD's awesome, by the way, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, so far, I'm only halfway through it.  I got to watch the other half today, but, and you talk about how you guys wanted to bring  the rock show back to the fans.  I think that's pretty cool, too.  Yeah, well, you know, that's how it was when we were all growing up.  Hell yeah, man.  There's a whole generation that's been deprived of that.  Right.  Because they started, you know, into the grunge scene and all that when it was flannel t-shirts  and park hands and, you know.  Man, just staring at their shoes and, I mean, the music was great, but, yeah, you didn't  feel like you were getting your money's worth, you know? 
[03:54:30]  Exactly.  Or did they?  Did they even know?  Yeah.  You know, I mean, some people may not even know that, like, oh, wow, you could actually  get that kind of a show for $30, $40.  Right, right.  So.  Well, there's nothing worse than those douchey West Coast bands that think it's too, they're  too hip to interact with the crowd at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's our cue.  What are we at?  Oh, there's the Pac-Man music.  Yeah, we got, like, two minutes left in our show today, Sully.  Oh, right on, man.  Well, hey, best of luck to you guys, and congrats for being back out there.  Oh, and by the way, man, I want to just say thank you guys for playing Dropbox on your 
[03:55:00]  show.  Hell yeah.  That's a big deal, man.  I really appreciate that.  I hope those guys blow up and kill everything.  Cool.  When are you guys going to come in and play?  We were supposed to work something out, but it's just, I don't know, timing was...  Well, I will tell you this.  This tour wraps up at the end of November, and then the first week or two weeks in December,  we're flying back to the East Coast, and we're going to do, like, two weeks of acoustic  dates.  Oh, cool. 
[03:55:30]  Right in the area.  So we're going to be right around you.  I'm about to do some acoustic songs right here in the studio.  Hell yes.  All right.  We'll bring it in.  All right.  Sully, thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  Right on, man.  Continued success.  Everyone should go get the DVD.  What's the name again?  It's called Changes.  There it is.  Okay.  Let's see.  This music gets you all hyper.  We got to go, bro.  All right, man.  We'll talk soon, all right?  Later.  All right.  There he is.  Sully from Godsmack.  We're out of here.  Tomorrow on the show, John Valby.  We also, we bring back Lesbian for a Day. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  Lesbian for a Day.  If you thought we had too many political discussions today, wait for tomorrow.  We'll balance it out with the lesbians.  Forgot to mention Bob.  What?  Bob Kelly.  Oh, Bob's going to be here.  Great.  Oh, he is?  Yeah, that should be.  Yeah, how about that?  Unbelievable radio.  Can't wait.  Lesbians are Bob Kelly.  Wow.  You're right.  I should have mentioned Bob Kelly first.  What do we got?  30?  Oh, 30 seconds?  I'm counting.  He lost me at the end of that.  I'm looking at Google's up to 190 a share opium. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, really?  I went back into it again today.  And it's up $4.35, so I'm almost ready to punch out.  But can we stop the music?  I have something serious I want to talk about.  Hey, what's that, Jimmy?  No.  You're not going to stop the music.  You're just going to cut me off.  You'll have to tell us tomorrow.  We're out of here.  Bye-bye.  Bernie Getz said that I'm...  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive picture?  The OPNM Show.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America... </pre>
