<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Patrice O'Neal as a guest, filling in for Jim Norton who was on *The Tonight Show*.  The show started with a caller's anecdote about racial tensions, segueing into a discussion of societal injustices and the perceived indifference of powerful figures like Alan Greenspan and a Rockefeller.  This transitioned into a detailed discussion about the conspiracy documentary "Obama Deception," which alleged a vast system of government and financial deception, touching upon the Federal Reserve, the supposed US bankruptcy in 1933, and the use of Social Security and 401Ks as collateral.  The conversation spiraled into various conspiracy theories surrounding World Wars I and II, the Vietnam War, 9/11 (including discussions about the WTC collapses, NORAD's response, and the passport found in the rubble), and the assassination attempts on Thomas Jefferson and JFK.  The Rothschild family, Alan Greenspan, and a jokingly referred-to "Bill Burr group" were mentioned as influential players.  The potential for a New World Order, erosion of civil liberties, and the creation of a standing army were also discussed.  The segment concluded with speculation about global warming as a tool for economic control, all punctuated with frequent strong language and humorous reactions from the hosts and O'Neal.

Following this, the hosts promoted a live St. Patrick's Day broadcast from Connelly's (14 East 47th Street, NYC).  The death of WWE wrestler Test was discussed, along with listener calls offering further details.  Movie reviews followed, with Kent discussing the box office failure of *Watchmen* in contrast to *Race to Witch Mountain*.  *Watchmen*, *Tropic Thunder* (praising Robert Downey Jr.), and *Cloverfield* were reviewed, with anecdotes about movie-going experiences and a run-in with Jeffrey Lyons.  The discussion veered into movie critics' biases, particularly Roger Ebert's alleged preference for Black films, leading to a debate on race in comedy and film, referencing *Soul Plane*, *Friday*, *American Gangster*, and *Midnight Run*. A listener recommended *Eastbound & Down*, prompting a discussion about Danny McBride. The deaths of Ron Silver and Charles Lewis (Tap Out founder) were announced, followed by a brief mention of the show's intern David's upcoming reviews.  The segment concluded with news of Don Imus's prostate cancer diagnosis and an extended, controversial discussion about Jackie Mason's use of a Yiddish slur and the backlash from Al Sharpton, with Patrice O'Neal offering extensive commentary.  Kat Von D's and Jay Moore's upcoming appearances were promoted, and the live broadcast was again advertised.


The next segment began with a discussion about advertisers' perceived over-caution in depicting Black people in commercials, extending to the changing landscape of acceptable humor about various ethnic groups.  The hosts discussed limitations on comedians regarding jokes about age, race (Polish and Chinese people specifically targeted), and other sensitive topics. Britney Spears' comeback tour was discussed using sexually suggestive language.  Dr. Steve called in to discuss Imus's prostate cancer diagnosis and provide medical information, leading to crude jokes about bodily functions.  Kat Von D joined the show, discussing her book *High Voltage Tattoo*, tattooing, various horror stories, listener and staff tattoos (some described as "horrible"), tattoo placement, pain, and changing social perceptions of tattoos. She also briefly discussed past tequila consumption.  Jay Moore then joined, discussing his career, social media, and experiences in the entertainment industry.  The segment ended with further banter, jokes, and offensive language from the hosts and guests.


The following segment focused heavily on stand-up comedy, particularly impressions and the differences between Black and white comedians' styles.  The discussion included a significant debate about which comedians could win a physical fight, mentioning Joe Rogan, Corey Holcomb, Tracy Morgan, and Gary Goldman.  Patrice O'Neal and Jay Moore shared numerous anecdotes, including stories about fights at comedy clubs.  Moore recounted a wild night with Tracy Morgan involving PCP and a club altercation.  Impressions of Tracy Morgan, Chris Tucker, Al Pacino, Harvey Keitel, and others were performed and discussed.  A story about a chaotic incident involving Tyra Banks and her models was also mentioned.  The careers of various comedians were compared, including Patrice and Frank Caliendo. Moore's role in *Gary Unmarried* was discussed, along with a story about an encounter with Whitey Bulger.  The segment concluded with further discussion of impressions, comedy styles, and a mention of the upcoming live broadcast, again utilizing offensive language and controversial topics.


The final segment featured Jay Moore prominently, focusing on stand-up comedy styles and the talents of various comedians, including Dimitri Martin, Patrice O'Neal, Brian Regan, and Penn & Teller.  Attell was mentioned as a favorite.  A large portion focused on Moore's impressions of comedians and celebrities, including Kanye West (a lip-syncing bit was discussed), Matthew McConaughey, and Charles Barkley.  Anecdotes about audience reactions and the challenges of performing impressions were shared.  Dean Edwards, Corey Holcomb, and Kevin Hart were also mentioned.  Stories involving drug use, a comedian's seizure (possibly triggered by a B12 shot), a stun gun incident, and other humorous and offensive anecdotes were shared.  The hosts interacted with the intern, David, and had a call with Rich Vos.  The segment concluded with a discussion of St. Patrick's Day and a Guinness promotion, maintaining the informal, vulgar, and comedic tone throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Wow!  That's a waker-upper.  It sure is. Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show!  Greetings.  Patrice O'Neill in studio, we want to get right into this because I'm enjoying my Sunday just kind of mellowing out.  Sure.  Watching a little LeBron, watching the Cavaliers and the Knicks, watching a little golf, Tiger Woods doing his thing.  Top 10 finish. He's back on the road to recovery. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Getting his skills back.  Old man boobs won again, Phil Mickelson.  Even though they called it the cold sweats.  What?  Yeah, the final round of the tournament yesterday.  Most people could give a shit about golf, I understand, but this little point you could give a shit about.  He's leading going into the final round.  He basically has the flu and they said that he's in the bathroom with the cold sweats before he teed off. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, he was taking a massive...  Well, that's the polite way of saying that, yeah, he had explosive diarrhea before he had to tee off.  Well, you're sweating and your thighs hurt.  Sure.  So he was miserable, but he was able to hold on and win at Doral.  But anyway, I'm watching all this stuff, just mellowing, having a nice Sunday, and then Patrice calls up.  Sounded like he was on drugs or something, I don't know.  He's like, hey, call me back. 
[00:01:30]  So I call him back, he's like, you've got to watch the Obama deception.  Oh my God, it'll open your eyes.  And I'm thinking to myself, Patrice is a black guy, Obama deception, what the hell is that?  That sounds like some kind of Rush Limbaugh thing.  I don't know.  Some kind of propaganda.  Sure.  I watch it all.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got it, you know.  So before Patrice goes off, I watched most of it, because I didn't have time to watch the  whole thing by the time he called me, because I had it crash.  I got up to, I did nine out of the 12 parts that you can find on YouTube. 
[00:02:00]  Not bad.  And then Patrice calls in the middle of that again, and we start discussing it for an hour.  Then I go to bed, and this is where I say F you today.  My dream was, I was rocking.  I was one of those Illuminati guys.  I was being swept away to secret meetings, and I had like people, I don't even know who  they were, but they needed to get to me, because I was up to no good.  I was like help running the world.  But I wasn't the main guy, I was like just one of these guys. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  You were.  It was like an action movie, because of you.  That's right.  Woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat.  My girl's like, what's wrong?  I'm like, ah, nightmares, nightmares.  And then went back and got to part two of this action movie that you put in my head.  I tried to call, I tried to call you, motherfucker.  You, I don't know what you was doing.  I called you a few times.  I haven't called you enough to know to leave messages.  Like, I don't know.  So, I just called, tried to maybe see a missed call, and I was trying to tell you to watch  it.  Yeah.  Because the Obama deception is basically, it's not what you think it is. 
[00:03:00]  It's not saying that Obama is magically awful.  Right.  It's just, and it goes back to Bush and all of them.  It's not that they're, it's just the system.  It's more like the presidential deception.  It's just what it, it's just what it is, man.  Yeah, to think that, uh, it's horrible.  The system's going to change because Obama's in there, but basically this movie's saying,  ha, yeah, right.  So the whole Obama president, nah, don't mean nothing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It don't mean nothing to anybody. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Like, it don't even mean nothing to people who are like, well, he's going to do something  or not.  But it's so big that I don't know even if the president knows what it is.  Uh-huh.  I don't know, because he's looking like he wants to quit.  Like, when I'm looking at him now, he looks like, can I get out of this shit?  I just wanted to, I just wanted to campaign and get the job.  I don't want to do the job.  Right.  I don't want to, I don't want to help destroy the planet Earth.  Yeah, because he, he, he was taught what it's all about.  Like, we noticed he looks tired finally. 
[00:04:00]  He looks grayer all of a sudden.  He looks like he got into something he didn't want to get into.  That sparkle in his eyes is kind of leaving.  And his job in the, the movie, what his job is for, for them, for the people.  The Illuminati?  The them.  No, not the Illuminati.  They never said the Illuminati.  The Bill Burr group?  The Bill Burr group.  The Bill Burr group.  The Bill, the Bill Burr group.  The Bill Burr group is running the world. 
[00:04:30]  They're running the world, and they are comfortable saying the, the Bill Burr group.  Yeah.  Um, who, but they're not comfortable saying the Illuminati, but people are comfortable  that the Bill Burr group exists.  And, and Obama, all his job is to do is keep the people loving him.  Yeah.  That's his job.  His first mission is making sure people keep loving him.  Keep on track.  He apparently is the guy that needs to be in there right now. 
[00:05:00]  Yes.  According to this movie, the Obama deception.  And Alan Greenspan, who is big in this, evidently, according to this movie.  I'm not comfortable.  I'm watching this movie.  Yeah.  You gotta, you gotta keep propaganda close.  You know, I just, you gotta keep that word close at hand when you start discussing this stuff.  Alan Greenspan, according to this movie, is one of the biggies at the Federal Reserve Bank,  who, by the way, has nothing to do with the feds.  I, this is.  I always thought the Federal Reserve had something to do with America, and I learned. 
[00:05:30]  Absolutely not.  No, I did learn that recently.  It has nothing to do with it.  It has nothing.  It's a bank, like, fucking, whamu.  It's, that the country owes money to.  But, I thought it was the feds.  How do they owe money to themselves?  In the movie, it goes, it's basically as federal, as Federal Express.  Yeah.  That's what they say.  And basically, we owe this bank a lot of money. 
[00:06:00]  A lot of money.  When did the country go bankrupt, according to this movie?  1933.  Three, I think, yeah.  It went bankrupt.  So, now, so, when the Federal Reserve Bank prints up money, that, that cost has to come  from somewhere.  Yes.  And they're only lending this paper with the denominations on it.  They're lending it to us.  Yeah.  And then it's got to be paid back to whom?  To.  The Bill Burr group.  Bam, bam, bam.  Like. 
[00:06:30]  So, oh, wait a minute.  Let me tell you what Alan Greenspan said in the thing.  And it's so much shit that it's like, I couldn't even go in order.  They ask him, they go, hey, man, what's the relationship between the president and the  Federal Reserve Bank?  He went like that.  He goes, I don't know.  Like, it don't have to be a relationship.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't.  No big deal on a relationship.  There's nothing he can say or do or think that could affect the Federal Reserve Bank. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  There's absolutely nothing.  You go back into.  Now, I watch one called The Zeitgeist.  Oh, boy.  Zeitgeist, right?  You spent the whole day.  You went from movie to movie to movie.  When I go home, I'm going to take a nap, get back up.  And have my face.  And educate yourself.  And have my face dunked into a fucking, into conspiracy theories.  You're going to just keep digging in, right?  So, Zeitgeist starts off with, I didn't even, I'm sticking with government right now. 
[00:07:30]  Zeitgeist starts off with the lie of Jesus Christ, the whole thing.  So, I just said, I can't get into this one right now.  Yeah, yeah.  This one's deep.  But the, but the, the, the, that, this one goes into why we went into the Revolutionary  War, which is all about money, which is the fact that when the people left England, they  printed their own money.  They created their own system.  They thought it was to get freedom of religion and speech and, and, and to worship and.  No, they were, they were here.  To be free and all that stuff. 
[00:08:00]  How do you, how do you give a fuck?  If you're in England, what are you going to do in America?  Nothing.  They, they printed their own money.  England said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, nah, that's, cancel that shit.  No, you can't have your own money.  So, now that they don't have their own money, they had to give, they had to take loans from  England at percentage.  So, the, they go, they go, we're enslaved.  So, they go, fuck it.  The Revolutionary War was them going, fuck it. 
[00:08:30]  They're not paying you.  I'm not paying you, nigga.  And they go, they go, we'll fight to the death before I keep paying you this bullshit.  That's when they won the freedom.  But right after that, these people, JPMorgan Chase, allegedly, Rockefeller, allegedly, according  to this movie, fucking Rothschild.  Rothschild.  We've heard the Rothschild name.  Rothschild.  Love his candies.  Who, it's mind-blowing, who, in, during the Napoleon War, whatever war that was, the 
[00:09:00]  French Revolution or whatever.  Yeah, one of those.  Rothschild found out, because he had family over there, that Napoleon lost.  And this is before Google.  Yeah, you couldn't just Google.  So, he found out a day early that the war was lost by Napoleon.  He put a word out that Napoleon won the war.  And everybody was horrified that England lost the war.  Took everything out.  Everything plunged.  England was worthless.  Rothschild goes in with $1.50 and buys England. 
[00:09:30]  Finds out Napoleon won.  I mean, lost.  England's worth millions now.  Now, everything goes back up.  Guess who fucking runs...  He bought it at dirt cheap.  Dirt cheap.  Now it's worth...  Mr. Rothschild owns England.  Owns the world.  Now, America fought their way out of this.  This is the spirit of where America came from.  Yeah.  Now we're living under it right now.  Now you get up to Woodrow Wilson, signing the Federal Reserve Act. 
[00:10:00]  1913.  1913.  In 1933...  I know my history.  The fucking...  America collapses.  Bankrupt.  Bankrupt.  Yeah, yeah, that was the big one.  The country is bankrupt.  They have to borrow more money from the feds.  So the feds, which are...  It has nothing to do with the federal government.  They have to borrow more money.  This is why, again, a whole other side shit where they start wars on purpose so they can just keep lending money. 
[00:10:30]  So they can keep lending money to everybody.  They don't give a fuck.  So, in 1936, as collateral for the new money that they're lending, the big bankrupt money, they create Social Security and 401ks and all that shit as collateral for the money they're lending now.  How are you going to pay this money back?  It's like, well, we got people now giving money into us and that'll pay you back. 
[00:11:00]  And here's the thing.  It's never based on force.  It's never based on pistol to your head force.  It's based on we got people who think when they're 60, they're going to have this money to live their life.  But really, they're giving us this money freely to pay back this loan.  It amounts to some kind of Ponzi scheme that can't possibly be paid off to everybody when they reach retirement age. 
[00:11:30]  There just isn't enough cash.  There you go.  Dude.  There you go.  So now, why is it called the Obama deception?  Because...  Because everyone believes that Obama's going to change the world, but the fact is he's just...  Let's change America!  He's just the next guy in there to keep everything going.  He's just the guy.  He's just whatever they need him to do to be... 
[00:12:00]  And they brought up the fact that the last real president we ever had was Kennedy.  JFK.  And he was trying to, like, go against...  And guess what happened to him?  This whole thing.  I hear something.  And they took him out.  Splitting headache one day.  And they said that the only president that ever...  That the only...  Every president that ever stood up to this is no longer with us before he was not supposed to be.  No longer with us.  And the only one that made it through was Thomas Jefferson.  Really?  That early?  Yes.  Like they were pulling those shenanigans? 
[00:12:30]  Thomas Jefferson's the only one that didn't...  They tried to kill him a few times.  But, you know, back in the day, they didn't have, you know, laser beams.  Yeah, you had to hope he was going to sip the arsenic tea that you left by his bedside.  You had to sneak your musket in and blow his face off.  You got to wait until he's at Broadway watching this shitty show with his wife.  He didn't hit him right in the head.  And I guess...  Hoping you're opening the right curtain to shoot him.  Hoping that musket ball took his face off.  And he didn't... 
[00:13:00]  He's the only one that stood up against him that didn't...  I didn't even know they tried to kill Thomas Jefferson.  Yeah, a few times.  Yeah?  Do you know of any of the plots that went wrong?  Fuck no.  I don't know.  I'm repeating shit like a parrot.  I got to go find out.  Some black slave girl with a bear trap and a pussy or some shit.  Yeah, but that's what we all do is we just turn into parrots.  You read one political book.  And I'm a parrot.  Next thing, you think you know everything.  But I'm just repeating what I said.  It's just...  I believe it, though. 
[00:13:30]  I just believe it because we're living in that time.  And the actual thing is what they're trying to unfold has been since World War I is a one world thing.  Yeah.  The last bit of it is, I think, China.  Because they're trying to get...  You know, they cancel Europe.  The EU, there's no borders.  Yeah, yeah.  But they signed a thing called the North American Union, and there's no borders here either.  Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., it's borderless. 
[00:14:00]  That's why no one's talking about immigration and sneaking across the border, because they want one big thing.  So that they can control one big thing.  They're canceling all this horse shit.  One world bank.  One world bank to make one world, you know...  Well, that would be a pretty powerful entity.  They did it to Africa.  They think Africa was the first one they did it to.  Yeah, cancel all these funky African countries.  We need one Africa.  Those borders were changing every week anyway. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck all that.  EU, and then China.  And I don't think China's involved quite yet, but they're the next one that we've got to figure out.  Well, the story came out how China's a little...  They're getting a little edgy about how much money we owe them, because they are in possession of a lot of our dollars, and if something happens to our dollars, they're shit out of luck.  So they're starting to say, hey, we need a little security here.  You need something to back this shit up. 
[00:15:00]  How much?  Yeah.  $787 billion?  Yeah.  How can you back this shit up?  It's just paper to us.  $5 trillion?  Yeah.  That's missing?  That's a lot of fucking massive firecrackers.  That's coming out of your kid's asshole?  Every time you get a motherfucker, every time you have a baby, tax a little cash register for the...  The best part of the Obama deception was going through all the stuff Obama said during his campaign.  Yes.  Like, I'm going to get everybody out of Iraq. 
[00:15:30]  I'm going to do this, this, and this.  And then they're showing, unfortunately, in the movie, they should have waited to put the movie out until Obama's in there a little longer.  Right.  But they're saying, like, in the first 30 days, he's drastically changing his tune.  And they're basically saying he's the biggest liar of all of them.  Wow.  Well, because the Guantanamo Bay thing...  Oh, yeah, which pissed off Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute, you'll like this one.  This is why I wanted to call you.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  They didn't really close.  The gun laws...  Oh, yeah, they didn't close it.  Yeah, well, explain that to them real fast before you go to the gun laws. 
[00:16:00]  The Guantanamo Bay thing was just a promise to think about closing it.  Right.  In a year.  Not closing it.  I promised that I might close that shit.  In a year.  According to the movie.  Right.  Right.  Because from what I've heard, it sure sounds like he's closing his shit down, but...  But it's also being told that they're sending these prisoners elsewhere to get the crap beat  out of them.  They're not just letting them go and then, like, all right, go on with your lives.  It's not covered internationally.  Right.  They're just kind of moving them to another place. 
[00:16:30]  They're just sending them to, like, Saudi Arabia where they can...  According to the movie.  Right.  According to the film.  To the movie.  Right.  By Alex Jones, Obama's deception, who also did Endgame, by the way.  Because I'm very interested in Obama's stance and the new attorney general and Hillary and  all that on gun laws.  Well, here's the thing about gun laws, my friend.  According to the movie.  According to the film.  We are now a standing army.  We are absolutely a standing army. 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  Which means...  It means that our soldiers are now going to be slowly deployed all over the planet.  Very close to China and Russia.  That's crazy.  Very close.  Sending everyone everywhere.  That's crazy because Obama said that, you know, he wants to pull back.  Well, he put 30,000 extra troops in Afghanistan.  According to someone else.  I wasn't there.  I didn't see what happened.  Now, ultimately, though, what they're doing, and I forgot the name of the website, and essentially 
[00:17:30]  is...  And Rahm Emanuel said it in the movie.  He goes, look, eventually, look, America, being an American is not a privilege.  It is a...  It's not a right.  It's a privilege.  And you are to service.  They use this word service.  They use New World Order and service.  Service.  A lot.  Mm-mm.  Service.  You are to service this country.  And they're trying to implement that kids from 18 to 25 be required to service the country. 
[00:18:00]  Required.  No one...  They don't get into what the service is.  Yeah.  Basically, according to this film, that they are trying to...  They need more police.  So they're trying to create a civilian army for when the shit goes down and there's martial  law.  They need people.  And not everybody is going to come in and go, hey, I volunteer. 
[00:18:30]  So they're going to have service.  And what they're doing, the first phase, is to cancel the Second Amendment.  Right.  So that there's only the fucking police running around with guns.  Yeah.  People can't have guns to protect themselves.  They have to take away that shit so that they can go find out who's registered.  And there'll be criminals with them, but criminals will end up being our friend if this goes  down.  That's always been the way any kind of fascist state has worked. 
[00:19:00]  They take away the civilians.  And they use that fucking term a couple of times.  Yeah.  This shit is fascism.  And that's one of the biggies as far as the NRA goes.  They're saying all this stuff like, this is what goes down.  Usually when there's a gun law that's passed, if you're grandfathered in, you're fine.  Let's say you have a rifle that's considered an assault rifle.  And then they ban assault rifles.  They don't come to your door, for the most part, and take your weapons away. 
[00:19:30]  They did that in a few places where they outlawed handguns, like in Chicago and stuff, where  you had to take your pistol and hand it into the police department.  But for the most part, they haven't knocked on your door and said, we're coming for your  guns.  But that is something that is definitely a potential act under Obama and this attorney  general.  They've got a lot of anti-gun people in there, anti-Second Amendment people in there.  And if they're going to take the guns, and again, again, according to this film, that 
[00:20:00]  they want to take, the phase one is to take these, phase two is to get, slowly implement  service.  And Ronald Merrick's sitting there saying it, slowly implement service.  And they don't say nothing else, but fucking service.  So there's this youth army that kind of...  Nigga!  What the...  Like...  You know what I'm saying? 
[00:20:30]  And their job will be to keep the people from fucking saying, fuck you.  When they go, all right, everybody, listen, here's what we need to do.  Hear ye, hear ye.  We're just going to take your money and do...  We're going to just outright come in here with this, uh, with this V for Vendetta kind  of thing.  With this, um, uh, uh, what's the other movie that's like V?  Like where...  Hmm.  These move, these fucking movies, uh, with this, uh, they live kind of thing. 
[00:21:00]  Right, right, yeah.  When they come in and they just lower the boom and say, here's our plan, but it's too late  for you to do anything stupid, they're going to have motherfuckers, you know, poof, poof,  poof, poof, you know, making sure that people, they'll shoot a motherfuck in the face.  Service.  Mm-hmm.  Service.  As soon as you go, wait a minute, J.P. Morgan Chase, I want my money.  And they'll have somebody in that motherfucker to blow your face off.  We're sorry about that, uh, go to your home that you can't afford. 
[00:21:30]  Fast forward to why Obama was picked.  This movie's saying he was groomed for 30 years.  Yes, according to this film, because the global, globalization has a different phase.  It ain't white no more.  If you want to go global, most global is not white.  It's just Australia and England and America is full of white people.  But everybody else, he's there to make everybody else feel like they're possibly a part of this 
[00:22:00]  globalization.  Danny just ruined the whole little, uh, intrigue, world of intrigue through this movie for me  by telling me it is produced by the same guy that produced Loose Change, which I see...  Wait, his name is Alex Jones?  Did Alex, Alex Jones did Loose Change?  One of the biggest hunks of shit, fake, propaganda bullshit.  I believed, I believed in, he did Endgame too.  And look, the, again, the propaganda, you can believe if, if Rush Limbaugh does a well-done 
[00:22:30]  documentary.  Yeah.  I'm sure you go, whoa.  You can go, whoa.  And you want to, you, you, you, you lean towards what you believe.  Um, the 9-11 thing, according to the other movie, the Endgame, not Endgame, Zeitgeist.  Yeah.  Um, about 9-11 is this.  And, and, and, and again, forget 9-11 in terms of what, you know, actually what happened.  Yeah.  I'm talking about the background of it.  World War I, we could not get involved in World War I. 
[00:23:00]  America would not want to get involved.  No one supported World War I, us being in World War I.  Yeah, it's Europe's problem.  They sunk, they have this conversation, allegedly, but they, it's supposed to be on record.  Oh yeah, this is like something that's, no.  Some dude talked to another dude and said, listen, we're not, we can't get into one.  He goes, what if, uh, what if an ocean liner with a bunch of Americans on it fucking sunk?  It's torpedoed or something.  What if that happened?  What do you think?  Well, I think that America probably have to get involved. 
[00:23:30]  Boom!  Boom!  What is it, the Lusitania?  Yes.  Yep.  And we in.  Just like that.  World War II did not want to get into the war.  Wouldn't get into it.  Uh, FDR, is it from FDR?  Yeah.  He started to provoke, allegedly provoke Japan into fucking with us.  We embargoed them.  We stopped trading with them.  Weren't giving them the steel they needed.  We started threatening them on the side, like giving China some shit. 
[00:24:00]  And going, you know, giving China money and help.  And going, fuck those motherfucking Japs.  I don't like sushi anyway, bitch.  Australia tells America three days before, according to this film, that, you know, hey,  uh, these motherfuckers are getting together quite a large force in the Pacific, man.  They are, and they're heading towards Hawaii.  Huh?  What?  Huh?  Huh? 
[00:24:30]  What?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  We're in the war, and this bank, this bank needs this to happen so that we can support  all sides, all sides.  I mean, they had this thing where, uh, uh, you know, the Roosevelt's had a company that  was involved with the company that was making Cyclone B and all that shit, and they couldn't 
[00:25:00]  make Cyclone B, or they couldn't make something that, that FDR's company had patented.  They was lending them money to do that, and then they gave them 20 million for this  and that and this, and then all on interest.  They were lending us money to fight our war.  We were lending ourselves money to fight our war on interest.  Fast forward to Vietnam.  Vietnam, known, the reason we got into Vietnam was an attack on a ship that was a fucking  lie. 
[00:25:30]  The Gulf of, uh, Tonkin, yeah.  A fucking lie.  Here's what bothers me.  How can you, there's things that you move on to, right?  How do I move on to the Gulf of Tonkin without really talking about the, the, the, the,  the, the, the, the, the, like, how do you go to the next fucking thing?  Why don't you go, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, let's keep talking about  the fact that we may have sunk a ship with people on it.  Can we talk about that?  No, no, no.  We just keep moving.  Fast forward to the Gulf of Tonkin, a lie. 
[00:26:00]  Now, it's officially a fucking lie in history.  It's not an argument.  It's not Illuminati.  It's a goddamn lie.  But we fought it anyway.  It's a part of history.  And we go, eh, we fought it.  Fast forward to 9-11.  Listen, look, whether you go, you know, there's some things, okay, hey, conspiracy, we argue  back and forth.  I'm going with the climate of wanting to go to war for some shit, can't go to war, and 
[00:26:30]  need an event big enough to go to war.  Now, I can argue, we can argue the engines disappearing at the Pentagon, you know, we  can argue this, and we can argue the spots of the way the buildings imploded, like it  looked like it was demolished, and we can disagree.  I could go, I believe that shit.  And you go, fuck, though.  But I'm saying the climate of what's happening, it's the same as the other three. 
[00:27:00]  Why can't we think that this shit could happen?  It's shot.  Building 7, and don't roll your eyes yet, I just watched Building 7, they put a picture  of Building 7 falling, that didn't get hit, that didn't have structural damage, imploding  the same exact way as a demolition, a planned demolition, the way it fell.  There's people that say it.  Now, I know how you feel about it.  Yeah, you know, Mike.  I couldn't argue back and forth about it, because we're both going off what we believe. 
[00:27:30]  We didn't go out there with, you know, our meters, anything like that.  I'm repeating some shit, you're repeating some shit, which you feel.  So, I'm just stepping back going, historically, the country would do some fucked up shit so  that it can lend itself money for war.  And here's the Vietnam War that they're comparing to the Iraqi thing.  All they needed to do is sustain. 
[00:28:00]  The Vietnam War was never supposed to be won.  It was just supposed to go on, and on, and on, and on, and on.  So I could keep lending myself money at interest, and keep taking money out your baby's asshole.  The only thing I can even throw in, as far as the 9-11 thing goes, I'll never, never believe  that explosives were put into a fucking working building, that these workers came in and wired 
[00:28:30]  these fucking buildings with explosives, because you know what that takes?  It takes an empty building, it takes jackhammering of cement structures that a secretary would  look and go, excuse me, what are you doing with all that C4?  Is there something?  So, I can't believe that.  And there was structural damage to the building.  When the two towers fell, it threw all kinds of shit into there.  It was on fire for a long time.  All I'm saying is, I don't believe there was this conspiracy that America planted bombs in there. 
[00:29:00]  Whether, here's the only thing I might buy.  Let me agree with you on this thing, and this is the thing that makes me not believe in aliens.  All right.  Is the secrecy of the average boob, the level of secrecy that a construction worker would  have to have to do that.  It's my, like, to be logical, I go, Jesus, that doesn't make any sense that a guy would 
[00:29:30]  go, yeah, all right, listen, let's pretend we're going to put explosives on it and kill  3,000 people.  I agree.  The deception that there's aliens somewhere in a building that fucking Johnny and Harry  the boob are guarding against us.  Yeah, yeah.  It makes me go, eh.  I think he's telling his chick.  Yeah, somebody knows that, hey, listen, E.T. is in this motherfucking building, sweetie.  I believe that.  But there are, the fact is that in order to pull off all the shit that's happening, you 
[00:30:00]  have to have the help of the people.  We have to, for some reason, we have to agree to fuck each other over.  And it's not far-fetched that a person has been on the phone and said to you, yeah, yeah,  hi, listen, I can't, my kid is dying, I don't have insurance.  Yeah, it's $1,500 a month, but I only make $750 a fucking week. 
[00:30:30]  Please help.  Yeah, well, that's $1,500.  There's, there, it is a reality that people in some form or fashion will fuck other people  really bad.  But here's, here's the only thing I could even wrap my mind around that perhaps, like  in the past, might have happened.  There was a plot by extremists, Islamic extremists, to do what they tried to do in the early 90s, 
[00:31:00]  bring down the towers.  Okay.  And perhaps somebody did know that this was going to go down.  That they let it go down?  No, and they let it go down.  Because the big thing is NORAD, NORAD has a 10 minute, 5 to 10 minute response time to  this type of shit.  And NORAD had an 80 minute response, like NORAD was shut down.  Like NORAD didn't, they didn't send planes, they didn't send, they, I won't even go for 
[00:31:30]  that because shit's supposed to work a certain way.  And we found out, as far as the government goes, shit don't work as fast as it's supposed  to.  Okay.  We thought there were fucking missiles on top of the White House and everything.  And there weren't.  Right, right.  The plane could have crashed right into the fucking White House.  Right, right, right, right, right.  But I think, I think the damage was, if, if that did happen, I'm still believing.  I'm not one like, bro.  And we needed this to happen to go to war, by the way.  We needed something as big as 9-11.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, to get everybody with American flags on their windows. 
[00:32:00]  To fucking go and fight any war that they told us to fight.  Right.  But I don't think, if, if somebody did know about this attack beforehand, and there were  FBI agents and stuff that said, look, this guy's taking fucking flying lessons.  There's suspicious.  That's documented.  Right.  But I don't think anyone thought it was going to be as fucked up as it was.  If a couple of planes flew into some buildings, and the fire department ran up and put them  out, and they found out, look at these terrorist motherfuckers trying to bring down the towers. 
[00:32:30]  They killed such and such people.  Let's go to war.  I don't think anyone thought both of those fucking towers were falling down.  But look at that.  And buildings around it.  And again, that's when we get into logistics of all that.  Yeah.  Ultimately, let's look at ultimately what happened.  The president, it's essentially a dictatorship when it comes to declaring war.  It used to be Congress.  Oh, Congress.  Now the president can, that fear we had of some kook pushing a button, it came true. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So if the whole plan was a kook to push a button, again, not to go back and forth about whether  9-11, we did it or some crazy shit.  But the fact is that ultimately, it moves closer to New World Order.  The point I think you guys are both missing, like, the towers didn't really need to fall  down to get the point across.  Right.  Just having, you know, the airliners crashing into two major buildings in New York City would  have done the job. 
[00:33:30]  I don't think anyone thought that would have happened.  Why not?  It would have been enough to get a war going.  I fucking disagree.  That's just like the ocean liner going down.  That's like, holy, that's a holy shit moment.  Let's say the ocean liner was hit.  That's why I think.  And didn't sink and 1,200 people didn't die.  Right.  3,000 people died.  People are still dying from all that horse shit in the air.  It made it easier.  But I think, you know, just having the planes crash into the buildings would have been good  enough to go with your theory that you laid out beautifully how we're like a war economy. 
[00:34:00]  Well, if those planes, if the buildings didn't fall, we would have rebuilt those holes.  We would have, we would, the buildings would still be standing tall with muscles.  I think watching those buildings fall.  But you don't think that would have been enough for us to go to.  Wow.  I think so.  I certainly think so.  I think the vision, the visual.  They really needed the buildings to come down.  Big.  Big.  Pearl Harbor was big.  The vision of Pearl Harbor, big. 
[00:34:30]  The Japs flying over, attack, everybody.  Holy mother, we were attacked.  Why did the planes hit so high then?  Well, they couldn't, they couldn't go on the street.  It was still, there was buildings that were 15 stories high.  They still had a little room.  They definitely had some room to hit lower.  I mean, let's, let's be honest.  The lower they hit, the more people.  They were giant airplanes.  The fact that they both hit their target.  But the lower they hit.  It was pretty fucking amazing.  The lower they hit, more people would die, whether the buildings fall or not. 
[00:35:00]  Now, look at your theory.  Why didn't they hit bigger, right?  Why didn't they hit higher?  And the buildings still collapsed.  See, this is what I'm saying.  We can go into space age, like, really theories.  But I'm just looking at, look, the Gulf of Tonkin is a lie.  The reason we went into Vietnam was a goddamn lie.  That's what I'm saying, is that, just add it up a little bit in terms of, I know this Illuminati people don't understand, but the Bilderberg group. 
[00:35:30]  The Bilderberg group.  The Bilderberg group.  I love calling it the Bilderberg group.  And all of this shit, it's just that it's, it just, you gotta, you can't think that something's not going on.  Yeah, it's not what it is on the surface.  Like, you can't think something.  I'm way in as far as that stuff goes.  I mean, that's all.  I mean, we can go back and forth with, like, that's what I'm saying.  And that's, but that's where, okay, to get really, like, black about it, that's where they want us to do is, okay, there you go.  If somebody's, like, if the man, the guy's going, with the long cigar and the twisty fucking mustache is sitting there going, ah, they might, these guys are fucking talking about it. 
[00:36:00]  And then me and you, we get into this thing about, why didn't the planes hit higher?  And they go, whew, okay, good.  Yeah, talk about weighing the planes.  Let's talk about the shit.  They're off the hot zone here.  Like, that's what I'm saying.  The whole idea is for us to talk about the details of it.  I gotta go back.  I really don't think they needed the buildings to come down.  You got, you know, you got one that hit the Pentagon, and who knows where the one in PA was going. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  You know, it was, that was pretty damn impressive that day.  But ultimately, the bank owns America.  Sure.  They got the grand finale with the buildings, you know, going down, which made it a lot easier.  But, man, I don't know.  It seems like they had enough to go and start a war in the Middle East.  That's possible.  But again, think about this.  And that's not even a question that we need to ask, like, in terms of government.  Because I'm with Ant with the whole.  That's a people question, man.  I'm with Ant with the whole demolition thing. 
[00:37:00]  But then you got someone on the phone.  Do you think it's a good enough?  Someone on the phone said just the planes hitting was good enough.  Yeah.  You know why?  We were out for blood when they blew up the basement, and it didn't bring the towers down.  And which they said in this movie.  I don't know which one.  I watched a million of these stupid movies.  is the reason they didn't do it then is because they, wait a minute, only six people died during that one.  Right, right.  They said we can't get in there like that. 
[00:37:30]  No more.  No kidding.  But what started changing these laws was not 9-11.  Yeah, it was the 1992, was it?  No, your boy.  White boy.  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Not the...  McVeigh.  Oh, McVeigh with the, uh...  It's 168 people plus children in a building.  Yeah, yeah.  It made domestic terrorism.  But it started changing the laws which were starting to unfold for us to be afraid enough to lose our civil liberties. 
[00:38:00]  To just let the government do what they need to do.  Well, we can't have this blown up again, so the government says they have a way to prevent it, so let them do it.  But it's taking away some of your rights.  Okay.  I don't use those rights that much.  Yes.  Those aren't the rights I use a lot.  I use freedom of speech.  I use that every day.  Well, the good news we found is, uh, what, passport, Muhammad, you know...  His passport, this is...  Are you fucking kidding? 
[00:38:30]  Do you...  Listen to me.  Just as a...  I love this angle.  Go ahead.  As a fucking reality person.  Yeah.  The fucking plane was eviscerated.  Yeah.  The buildings were eviscerated.  People were eviscerated.  Vaporized.  Nothing.  But they found his passport, Muhammad Atta's passport, in the rubble.  Why?  What was it in his top pocket?  And his titty blew off?  Intact? 
[00:39:00]  And here's this fucking passport on the ground.  He was in the front of the plane.  He was in the...  He just flew out.  Flew right through the windshield.  Flew right out the windshield.  Why?  And landed perfectly.  But he was gone.  But they found his fucking unscarred passport...  Yeah, of course.  ...on the ground.  Here he is, motherfucker.  Here he is.  Here's the guy.  I'm like...  I understand a motherfucker...  But he was on the plane.  And he had a fucking passport.  Shut the fuck up, man!  Stop!  They know exactly who... 
[00:39:30]  What?  It was Muhammad Atta hiding out now going, oh, thank God.  Anthony, if I lit you on fire right now, they wouldn't find your license unscathed?  It'd be melted.  It'd be something for...  The entire downtown was destroyed.  But we found this motherfucker's passport.  What does that mean?  Meaning that...  Okay.  We have to go on Conspiracy World.  What does it mean?  Somebody takes this fucking...  Here's this paper here. 
[00:40:00]  Somebody got Muhammad the setup Atta, who was on the...  Where is he?  And they just go...  Where's Muhammad Atta, then?  Who the fuck knows?  He was sitting in that fucking pilot seat.  They're saying that there's some people that, on that list, to this day, that are alive.  Yeah, that's crazy.  But why is it crazy if they're saying it?  You're saying it's crazy because you don't believe it.  I want to know where they are.  Let's put him on TV.  What is a dude that said in 2001...  Oh, that guy...  I saw him, I know him.  In the telegraph.  He's the fucking guy.  He said, here's a picture. 
[00:40:30]  The guy said, that's a picture of my son who's alive, 10 years younger than what he is now.  And the guy's like, that's me, 10 years younger.  And then we go like this.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Listen, that's what...  See, ultimately, my thing is, can we stop for a second and not let the next thing go on before we go...  No, no, no.  I'm not allowing you to move on until you tell me why Donald Rumsfeld is good pals with Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. 
[00:41:00]  Well, he was.  But I'm saying, can you tell me...  Can you go from the point where we got involved with all this oil shit from the...  Yeah.  The entire thing from Iran, the original Iran hostage crisis, which was about oil and about the Ayatollah and about that shit...  It's also about Muslim extremism.  To the point where...  Here's the thing.  Where we stop.  The whole...  This thing that still to this day fucks me up. 
[00:41:30]  How do we know that they have weapons of mass destruction?  Because we sold them this shit.  How do we move on from that?  How do...  We have the receipt.  We, the ones who gave this fucker the weapons to kill Iranians, that's how we fucking know.  Why won't...  The citizens, not the motherfuckers that's doing the shit, why won't citizens not let that move on? 
[00:42:00]  But that was...  Because that was what you did at that point.  We were enemies with Iran.  We weren't as big enemies with Iraq at the time.  So we supplied them.  Same thing with Osama bin Laden.  They were fighting the fucking shit out of the Soviets in Afghanistan.  Kicking their ass.  We loved watching the Soviets get their ass handed to them.  Absolutely.  So we gave the Afghanis a shitload of fucking... 
[00:42:30]  But what I'm saying during this, what you're talking about is what I'm saying is this.  Me and you were friends doing fucked up shit.  Now we're not friends.  Now my war against you is not personal.  It's some thing that just happened by the way.  The fact is we were buddies doing fucked up shit.  Now I got to die.  My kid got to die.  I got to jump out of windows and shit because me and you are no longer friends. 
[00:43:00]  So there's a lot of collateral damage because I want a piece of your funky ass because you fucked me over.  That's what I mean is that this shit is some personal vendetta shit that's involving everybody and money.  And it's like, Anthony, man, give me that money you owe me.  Nope.  Motherfucker.  I'm going to kill Anthony.  All right, America, we got to go kill this nigga.  Why?  Oh.  Because of 9-11.  We got to go fuck you up. 
[00:43:30]  Because of Lippertania.  I'm going to fuck you up because of Lippertania.  Well...  Damn.  The Bill Burr group started this whole thing.  The Bill Burr group.  The Bill Burr group.  And you're like four or five movies in.  Man, my eyes are ready to fall out of my face, man.  Like I said, I had to stop because the dreams were like fucked up.  I'm going to do my studying this evening.  I tried to fucking call you until you watch the Obama Deception. 
[00:44:00]  I had a party going on from Friday fucking afternoon until like midnight last night when I finally  was like, I got to go to bed.  Partying over.  That was just partying.  Watch that shit today when you get a chance, man.  Because I thought it was interesting because I know you're not an Illuminati guy.  Yeah.  But you are a non-Obama guy.  And I like the fact that maybe the conspiracy, I wanted to see what your take was that Obama's  now seem to be sucked into this whole thing and taken in this conspiracy of why they might 
[00:44:30]  be, why he's strong on guns.  Do you think it was before or after his campaign and his election?  Do you think as he's campaigning, he knew, all right, this is the situation I'm going  to be, I mean, or he was elected and then they were like, well, Henry Kissinger, they  said Henry Kissinger gave him his first job out of college.  And Henry Kissinger was being interviewed and he was just like, I thought this kid was  this, you know, Henry Bilderberg Kissinger. 
[00:45:00]  Very good.  According to the movie.  According to the movie.  Yeah, I don't think there's a huge surprise.  I think if you're going for the presidency and if some of this stuff is true from the  film, that Obama's more than aware as he's moving forward in his career, I don't think  there's the big surprise.  The first black president.  Yeah, there might be a few things he hears about, but then, you know, he gets in there  and they go, yeah, you were right.  This is how it is.  Ta-da.  Because he definitely looks different now, man. 
[00:45:30]  He looks like he said.  He's like, wow, what did I get myself into?  He was the HNIC.  He sat in a room and somebody said, hey, man, he sat there, he popped his collar and somebody  smacked the shit out of him and said, you ain't running this.  Right.  And he was like, oh, my God.  Oh, did you see a Rihanna swelled up?  That's Obama.  That's really Obama's photo.  That's not Rihanna.  Somebody beat that shit out of Obama and told him, motherfucker, you ain't running this.  Alan Greenspan might be, he came in the room and said, no.  That's why when Bush, well, Obama walked the Bushes out to the helicopter, you know, Bush 
[00:46:00]  was like, hey, you have no idea.  You are a deep shit.  You have no idea.  So you go back in there.  I'm going back to drinking.  He did a big, whew, thank God that's over with.  Obama has a pep in his step.  He's all ready to go.  Walks back into that White House and like Bill Burr says, they showed him the basement.  Uh-oh.  Oh, before you do anything else, we're going down to the basement for a few. 
[00:46:30]  I got a couple things to show you.  Give me your blackberry, nigger.  Because when he became president, when he became president, they said they debriefed  him on national security and this and that, all these things he needed to now know as the  president.  And I went there and I go, wow, that shows that someone else is actually in charge because  they now have to show him what it's all about.  Yeah, who's in charge?  The Federal Reserve Bank is in charge. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  These motherfuckers, the them.  Right.  But Bush people say white people.  I know what we mean now.  Yeah.  Bush was long gone and it was actually on the news.  You know, Obama's learning everything he needs to know to be the president.  So, who are those people telling him how to act as the president?  Wouldn't that mean that these people have more knowledge and more power than the actual  president?  And who are these people that stay?  Anytime a job, anytime someone, the boss leaves a job, people leave. 
[00:47:30]  Like, bosses don't just come in and everybody who was the boss when he was, is still the  boss.  There's people there that he can't fire.  It's like, hey, who are you?  Don't worry about who I am.  I want a new fry cook, motherfucking you.  I don't like you.  If I buy a McDonald's franchise, all you motherfuckers is fired.  By the way, I'm getting a report here from our researcher. 
[00:48:00]  Ata's passport was not found.  It was Satam Al-Sukwami's.  It was found.  According.  It's misreported by many.  Ten minutes of actual research.  And who is this?  It's the Tom Al-Sukwami.  But who is this that I'm supposed to go, okay, that's the thing?  The point, I think the point is that regardless of whose passport it was, the fact that so  many facts are misrepresented and reported as facts, it happens so much on any, you know, 
[00:48:30]  it's just whatever you want to believe.  Exactly.  And that's my saying.  This is why I said, okay, this is where it can implode, the conversation.  Yeah.  Where it goes to, okay, Muhammad Azhar is what?  Talk about details.  Fine.  Now, I go, now was it, was the Gulf, what's the shit again?  The Gulf of Tonkin, yeah.  Tonkin.  Was that, was that a lie?  It's official, right?  Yeah, that's pretty much known.  Okay, fair enough.  There's nowhere to go.  Yeah.  That we go to war based on lies, okay?  Now we get into whether this is that and the, who, who believe Muhammad wasn't Hubli, it 
[00:49:00]  was Gopata Mahata.  And now the guy with the big cigar is laughing because.  I don't, I don't, it's cool, good, but I believe, I believe there's a system that's  going on that we're just sitting there going, okay, we're going to argue about whether the  planes hit higher or not.  That's how, that's the people that run that, JP Morgan allegedly, knows that's how fucking  stupid we are. 
[00:49:30]  And we will argue that instead of going, hold up.  Right.  The Federal Reserve Bank, it, the country owes money to a bank like I owe money to a fucking  bank?  This is fucking crazy.  And you know, you know what's even more amazing is that you think in this day and age, there's  so much information out there on the internet that it would be harder to perpetrate these  little conspiracies by the government and, and by the world order.  Uh, but it's easier because these, there's so many distractions in the internet. 
[00:50:00]  There's so many ways to just like, look at the details instead of the thing.  Never forget this, Anthony.  The pit, the, when you look at that money, you look at the pyramid.  The pyramid is key.  The bottom of the pyramid is all the people.  The top is these, these, these couple of people.  What happened, the difference between now and 500 years ago is that the, it was the,  the guy, then the people, the people were right outside this fucker's door. 
[00:50:30]  At some point they had to create stuff for the masses.  Like, Hey, Hey, come here, man.  Look at this fucking piece of shit.  You don't want to have your feet as dirty as him, right?  Come on.  I got this new shit.  You clean your feet, give you some feet cleaner, give you some back warmer, get you in a house,  get you in a bed, get you feeling good.  And you go, Hey man, you want to be down with me?  Oh, you know what?  Run this fucker.  So we, you never forget that we are willing as people to fuck other people, to, to be a 
[00:51:00]  little bit better, to live a little bit better.  They're talking about this new, the motherfucker.  They went into global warming.  Nick.  Global warming.  What's wrong, Danny?  I'm just, we took a nice big huff.  Me and Danny, I want to love Danny again.  What is the problem?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That huff.  Can you tell me what that huff is so I don't feel like it's nothing?  I think you're just paying a little too much attention. 
[00:51:30]  Okay, fair enough.  So, so.  I want to hear the global warming thing.  Okay.  The global warming is some horse shit, right?  And this is what they're saying on the thing, but it makes a lot of sense.  What they're doing is they're taxing everything that has to do with so-called us fucking up  the environment.  Cars, trains, this, that, smoke.  And what they're doing with that is they're taxing anything that, that you're going to,  that developed countries already have.  But what that does is when there's, when there's, when they're canceling out the global warming, 
[00:52:00]  it stops underdeveloped countries from ever developing cars, trains.  They have to start with the shitty coal burning fucking smokestacks.  Exactly, they have to stay in huts while we go and make deals to own the whole underdeveloped  country.  They want motherfucking ladies with the titties down to their knees and fucking some guy with  his balls hanging down to his knees.  A stick on his dick. 
[00:52:30]  To come out, right?  And, and, and, and to stop developing those countries so that they can just go in and,  and, and, and the third world countries are the richest in everything.  So they got the diamonds, they got the fucking minerals, and they just go, go fuck yourself.  So they're saying, you know, global warming is, is a farce because gore, I'm just saying  what they're saying.  Gore has a bunch of companies that's going to benefit from the taxing of global warming. 
[00:53:00]  That, that if we go on a crusade against global warming, he'll get up.  So he isn't this nice guy trying to help out the world.  He's this fucking underhanded scumbag just trying to fleece the third world nation.  It's good for his business and it's good for business in general, uh, global warming.  Kind of using that same theory as a war economy, a global warming economy brings in a lot of  money.  If people buy into this whole global warming thing, it brings in a lot of money, right? 
[00:53:30]  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just saying, again, I could just get blown out of the water by someone that just  No, I believe in, I just, I just, the one part I believe in is that whole war economy  thing.  Absolutely.  War is good for business.  It always has been.  Always has been.  So global warming could be another way to kind of take what, what war has, uh, been able  to do for Americans and, uh, it starts another revenue stream.  Yeah, another revenue stream.  Another revenue stream.  Now we all have to go out and get our, you know, our cars. 
[00:54:00]  We gotta be green.  Yeah, we gotta go get our, be green.  Go get our wind crap and what, what not.  Let's take a quick break here.  Patrice O'Neal.  Got the phones lit there, Patrice.  I don't know.  I can't imagine how anybody can say anything.  I'm saying, look, don't fucking talk to me about, first of all, there was 22 and a half  tourists.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm talking about the climate and what this shit really is.  I don't, I don't, motherfucker, I don't travel the world finding, I'm just what I believe. 
[00:54:30]  I believe, you know, if the Federal Reserve Bank is not federal, that's a big fucking  deal.  That we're borrowing money from a fucking bank of dudes.  You know what, though?  I'm, I'm, I'm from the school.  Whatever the fuck is happening, let it keep happening because the whole world will collapse  if we try to change things.  Really?  Why and how?  You're going to try to like unravel this whole thing they set up years and years ago. 
[00:55:00]  But here's the thing.  If there's food, this is what I'm getting at.  It would have to be an all out revolution, right?  What would happen like there's food?  A worldwide revolution.  If there's food, feed motherfuckers.  Yeah.  If there's houses, put them in it.  Like, I know that sounds stupid, but that's what I'm saying.  What collapses?  Only, the only thing that collapses, it's not going to collapse on the motherfuckers at the  top.  Don't you think that they need class against class to keep them distracted against everyone's  happy in a house and eating?  They start looking upstairs and going, what are these motherfuckers doing? 
[00:55:30]  Race against race.  Poor white people fighting poor black people.  I went to this website, nigger mania.  And I go, ah, I've visited that quite a few times.  I'm looking at it and I'm going, and a friend of mine, we was talking on the phone and we  both said the same thing.  What the fuck did black people do to be so hated in this country?  What the fuck did we do?  Did you get one chuckle from the site?  It was interesting because, you know what?  It was very interesting.  They got something where the motherfuckers broke down every black invention and said 
[00:56:00]  it was some bullshit.  And I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you motherfuckers?  Like, we can't even have inventions.  You can't even have the peanut.  Niggas lied about the gas mask.  This is why.  Fucking Philip Johnson invented it.  This guy invented the stoplight.  That's bullshit.  Oh, Jesus.  It's just like, that's what I'm saying.  But all of this infighting, all of this, we're all getting fucked by this magic man somewhere 
[00:56:30]  and they're laughing at us.  Alan Greenspan, the shit he said where he just was like, it don't matter.  It don't matter.  What the fuck you think?  Yeah.  We're going to, I don't give a fuck.  The Rockefeller guy, he's like, I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  And then the guy's going, well, what's the next thing?  When you, world order, what's after that?  I don't know.  The whatever.  The whatever.  We've got to take a break.  Patrice O'Neal.  We've got to remind people, tomorrow we're going to be broadcasting live from Connelly's. 
[00:57:00]  I don't have the info in front of me.  What is it?  47th and Madison, I think?  Yeah, it's 14 East, 47th Street.  Yeah, let's call it 47th and Madison.  Connelly's will be there starting at 8 a.m.  getting everyone ready for St. Patrick's Day.  We've got a bunch of contests.  The Reddice Ass Hair Contest.  We're doing cherry darts?  Nice.  And a couple other things.  What else are we doing?  They didn't go with the Money Honey?  Well, we're going to do Money Honey, but somebody messed it up.  All right.  If you want to participate in any of these contests, you can contact Travis at opianthony.com. 
[00:57:30]  Who's going to be there?  Rich Voss?  Who else?  Colin Quinn.  Oh, that's right.  Colin Quinn's going to be at Connelly's tomorrow, 47th and Madison, 8 a.m.  One of our first live broadcasts in a very, very long time, so we hope to see a lot of you guys out there.  We're going to continue in just a bit here.  Opian Anthony.  All right.  We're back with the Opian Anthony show.  Patrice O'Neal sitting in for Jim Norton.  I think Norton's going to be on Leno tonight.  Is that the deal?  Kenny, tonight's the Leno appearance?  Huh? 
[00:58:00]  What?  Seven times.  I don't care how many times.  We all know he does it a lot.  That's cool.  Just make sure you check out Norton on Leno tonight.  Yeah.  A little story that was buried over the weekend.  Just want to spend, like, literally a minute with it.  You're a big WWE guy, right, Patrice?  Oh, yeah.  Test died.  Yep.  I saw that, man.  And they teased it to, like, another wrestler found dead, and you had to click on it to find out who it was.  It was kind of nice.  You're sitting there wondering, oh, boy, is it going to be a biggie, or is it going to be one of those Mexican wrestlers or something?  He was pretty big. 
[00:58:30]  He was really big.  In his ten minutes.  Lucha Libre's important, man.  Oh, you know.  Lucha Libre.  Who gives a shit if a masked wrestler dies?  But it was Test, who was only 33, which surprised me.  Wow.  Because he was big when we were at NEW.  He had his nice run.  And he was retired.  At 33?  Well, they said he came back recently in one of those other effing leagues, whatever.  The gymnasium leagues where they go to a high school gym and, you know, like Sam Roberts. 
[00:59:00]  What is it about wrestling where he just died?  No kidding.  That's what he and I were talking about.  And Test was a, this is not a bum one.  I was really surprised.  Like, Test.  Just really fast.  He worked with Edge.  He was Edge's tag team partner.  And I think Danny reminded me, or Sam, I think both of you guys, he was the one that Stephanie McMahon was supposed to marry.  Remember that?  Yeah, yeah.  They did that whole storyline, and then it went bad, and then Triple H stepped in.  That was his big, that was his big storyline. 
[00:59:30]  That was his huge storyline.  See, if you look at that, that was going to be his payday.  Right.  And then, you know, it breaks down, and he never gets over that.  Right.  Some drug allegations.  How they found it, his neighbors noticed they were looking through Test's window.  Uh-oh.  And saw that he was just kind of, I guess, sitting there, just not moving for a couple days.  And they went, oh boy, something's wrong.  Oof.  Called the authorities and found him dead.  Watching a very interesting program, I guess.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  33, though. 
[01:00:00]  Done.  Wow.  Wasn't he part of that amazing ladder match, like, years ago?  Yeah, we'd have to get, I think, Sam, what do you know on Test really fast?  Uh, Prime Time Sam Roberts.  Prime Time Sam Roberts.  When he's talking about wrestling.  Uh, was Test, but Lunch Time Sam Roberts.  Was he part of that, uh, amazing ladder match?  I don't know.  Test didn't have any amazing matches, per se.  He was more of a physical specimen.  Except with the Grim Reaper, just recently, I gather.  He was a group of guys that, I think Vince loves these guys. 
[01:00:30]  Mm-hmm.  They're just physically imposing.  Like, Kane, he will never get rid of Kane.  Apparently not.  He's been there forever.  He's a big guy.  Test was one of those dudes who was just a big, powerful, muscular guy.  Yeah.  But he wasn't fantastic in the ring.  I thought he was good.  I liked Test.  He just wasn't good on, on, as they stay on the stick.  Yeah, but they were trying to, they were trying to push him out there.  And then, uh, they backed way off, obviously. 
[01:01:00]  And then he went away.  And then he went away for a while.  In real life.  In real life.  Oh, really?  Yep.  He's done.  What do you know?  You know anything else?  No, I do.  They find the steroid needles, like, at his feet or anything?  I wouldn't say it was steroids.  Oh, that has not been proven.  But does Vince have to come out of his friggin' injury and come back in?  That's true.  Vince is still not.  Now I've, I gotta come out of the hospital.  Cause it's not really, you know, again, I tried to make it like I was injured.  And these guys keep killing themselves. 
[01:01:30]  Ruining my bitch.  You're dead.  Fuckin' guy was young, man.  They're saying he was 33.  I, I, I tend to think that's crazy.  Well, I mean.  Cause, I mean, we talked about him 10 years ago, man.  He was probably a kid, yeah.  He could have been in his 20s.  They liked it.  But, like, the headlines, like you were saying, you have to click on it to find out who it was.  It was like.  That was, that was nice, though.  That was exciting.  I got to see.  Yeah.  But the headline says, former WWE champion dies.  And you click on it. 
[01:02:00]  I'm like, wow, I'm thinking Hulk.  I'm thinking all sorts of things.  He doesn't reference that they mean WWE hardcore champion.  Hardcore champion.  Oh, he was never world champion?  Nah.  Ah, see, I bought it.  Tag team.  He had the silly belt.  He had the silly belt.  Yeah, he had the hard.  The silly belt.  Yeah.  All right.  And someone to say, let's give Steve a moment on the air.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show, Steve.  Patrice is in today.  What's up?  It is, Steve.  Can you believe how old he looked?  He looked close to 50 years of age.  Did he?  I didn't see him read some picture of Tess. 
[01:02:30]  Can we find one, maybe?  I don't remember as a young dude.  Yeah, he had his hair cut short.  He honestly looks like he's close to 50.  Right.  But he's also in rehab recently, too.  So he had his demons.  Yeah, obviously.  I mean, he was getting more jacked as everyone else was getting thinner.  Yeah, as time went on.  As everyone else went the other way.  At the end, he was gigantic.  What was the death reason?  All right, Steve, thanks.  They said they found him in his apartment.  They found him.  And they do.  All wrestlers, except for Benoit, the reason for death is found. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  How'd he die?  Found him.  They found him.  Well, what is he supposed to do?  Well, tell me how he died.  I don't even know how he died.  Oh, they will.  Kurt Hedding, I don't even know how he died.  Heart attack.  Then they come out and they say, oh, it was a heart attack and he was 40.  Yeah.  I'm like, what?  How do you know?  Well, okay.  Technically, the heart attack killed him.  But something led to the heart attack.  He's in his 30s.  Yo, Kizuna time.  Yeah, the heart attack.  Don't worry about it.  All right, it's a heart attack.  We found him and how'd he die?  Yeah.  Yeah, just, you know. 
[01:03:30]  What's he?  We found him.  Natural causes.  Please don't let my death cause be found.  Did he have three cups of cholesterol every morning?  I mean, he'd know a little more.  Fucking found him.  For breakfast?  What the fuck?  And what was the other thing on the test?  Ah, whatever.  So, we'll find out more.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Kent, the movie guy.  Kent, how are you, sir?  Hey, guys.  Just want to let you know, it's official.  Watchmen is a huge flop.  Massive flop.  Oh, they have a big drop off. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, I'm looking at the numbers, huh?  Down what?  Yeah.  65%?  Down about 65%.  And what's worse is that still, like I said last time I was on, that has to get split  three ways, and one of the ways didn't put any money into it.  So, only two studios are recouping any money from it.  So, cut, what's about 90 million?  Cut that to 60, then split that in half.  Does it suck?  Yeah, what's the problem with the movie? 
[01:04:30]  Is it a good movie?  I like it a lot.  You haven't seen it yet, Patrice?  That says a lot, because Patrice sees pretty much every movie that comes out.  It's just not moving me to see it, man.  It's just not, I just, it's not making me go see it.  There's something about it.  The problem, it's really long, and everyone's biggest complaint is it's really long.  But on top of that, it's not Batman, it's not Iron Man, you don't know who these people  are, you know?  Yeah, it's not like a known superhero.  That's the same thing that happened to the spirit.  The spirit.  Who?  I didn't know where it came from.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  Exactly.  That movie tanked, but mostly because it was god-awful.  That's one of the worst films I ever saw.  People like knowing they're superheroes.  That was Sam Jackson with the spirit.  I had a Beatles.  See, I didn't know.  Yeah, this is like a Blade Runner type of film.  It's going to be appreciated in like 10 years on video, but it is a huge flop.  Well, it's like the, what's that one Sam Jackson was in that I watched again, and I go,  wow, this movie was good.  The spirit?  Like we were just talking about something else.  The other thing with Bruce Willis. 
[01:05:30]  Wow.  M. Night Shyamalan.  Unbreakable.  Oh, Unbreakable.  Unbreakable could have been, Unbreakable could have been great.  I like that movie.  Later it might be, when I first saw the guy, then I saw the guy, I go, you know what, this  is a goddamn good movie.  I like that movie a lot, but they took way too long to get to the cool stuff.  You know?  I thought it was, the setup was like, the setup took forever.  Less setup and get us to the shit.  I think that's the point of the movie, it was a setup movie.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Set up to a franchise.  No, because then what would they do then?  Wasn't he supposed to make another one?  No, no, no.  Unbreakable was supposed to be a setup to a trilogy, and that's Shyamalan.  Yeah, I remember hearing that.  He had intended doing two more big films, and Disney was willing to back them, and he  walked away.  Yeah, that's just a douche.  He could have had what could have been a huge franchise.  Yeah, I thought Unbreakable could have been, you know, they had a nice concept.  Well, what's the redeeming factor, sir, for Watchmen?  What is the thing I should be looking for?  It's fucking ballsy, dude. 
[01:06:30]  That's what makes it really cool, is it is a comic book movie for adults.  It is violent, it's got the sex, it's got the action, it's got everything an adult would  want in a comic book movie.  It's not watered down in any way.  Now, if it had an audience, would it compete with anything?  What level would it be at?  Would it be at the level of Dark Knight, or would it be at the level of fucking...  Dark Knight, because some of the performances are kind of weak.  Some of the characters are kind of weak. 
[01:07:00]  I would put it up there with, you know, maybe Spider-Man 2, X-Men 1 and 2, it's up there,  but...  X-Men 1 and 2 rocked?  Yeah, well, I mean...  X-Men 2 is anything.  I mean, as a movie, it rocks, it's got an ending that's really good, but it's not a film.  Right.  You know, it's a comic book, but it doesn't aspire to be more than a comic book.  Well, the number one movie at the box office was Dwayne Johnson's film, Race to Wish Mountain, 
[01:07:30]  so thank God.  I'm so glad I told him back in the day that we would be way bigger than he'll ever be.  The Rock says...  My biggest faux pas ever.  I'm doing a Disney movie.  We had a huge fight with him, and I said, oh yeah, well, you'll never be as big as us.  You're just...  You gave the answer that the American Idol contestants that get kicked off early give.  Right, right, right.  It's like, oh, well, you know, you'll regret not having me on this show.  I'll be a bigger star than anybody ever. 
[01:08:00]  Movie after movie, he's just a huge star.  We have no problem with him.  He promotes...  This is the first movie I think he hasn't promoted on our show.  He didn't have to.  He didn't have to.  And it's good to know that he finally went with the whole he sounds like Obama thing on SNL.  We didn't discuss that, really, but...  Yeah.  We were screaming and yelling as soon as Obama came on the scene.  We're like, that's The Rock.  And finally, The Rock went on SNL and did a little Obama, so...  What's the best movie out there right now, Kent?  I'd say for your money, Watchmen, still the best movie out there. 
[01:08:30]  It's just...  You can't compete with a Disney film.  You can't.  Well, I wonder if it's a good movie.  I used to like the Disney films.  Maybe I'd go see Race to Witch Mountain.  No, no.  It is actually worse than the original films, which are pretty bad.  Yeah, all right.  A kid movie.  Fucking Don Knottson in some kind of way.  Yeah.  You know what I watched over the weekend?  Kent, we're going to let you go, Kent.  Thank you.  Watched over the weekend.  Can I put it real quick?  Shut up.  No.  Watched over the weekend for the second time.  First time I saw it, I was like, there was so much hype to it that I went into it and 
[01:09:00]  was like, eh, well, whatever.  And I watched it again over the weekend and there's so many little funny parts in it.  That goddamn Tropic Thunder.  Yeah.  Like, I watched it and was like...  And I called his fucking Oscar nomination, too, when we first saw it.  Fucking, what's his name?  I was just talking to someone.  It's funny you bring that up and I can't remember who.  They said they hated that movie and I was like, it was a good movie.  I thought it was all right. 
[01:09:30]  When I first saw it, I was like, eh, man, because it was so hype.  It's like, this is the funniest movie you're ever going to see, blah, blah, blah.  So I watched it and I was like, eh.  And then I watched it over the weekend and it's not so much the whole movie, it's these  little lines that are being thrown out that are hysterical and some of the action sequences.  Robert Downey Jr., for me, in that role, he was as good as Heath Ledger was as the Joker.  And I, it's hard to know. 
[01:10:00]  I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker.  He was as good playing that role.  That shit, it was hysterical.  How that broke down and the little kid was like, figuring it out as a rice farmer, motherfucker.  The little kid was hysterical.  He was the best white guy playing a black guy in anything I've ever seen in my life, man.  And I was trying to defend that movie over the weekend.  I can't remember who, it'll come to me.  But then I was thinking maybe it was because I saw the movie with Patrice.  You got to go to the movies with Patrice O'Neal. 
[01:10:30]  I don't go to the movies.  No, I understand that.  You got your theater and all that.  Yeah, why go to the fucking, and eventually you're going to start getting like first runs.  I know, right?  Yeah.  Let me get a screen, a copy of that.  You should invite him over then because like watching a movie with Patrice is, you're in  a whole different fucking world.  That's why I built a theater in my house.  So you don't have to watch it with a whole bunch of Patricians.  Oh, God damn, look at that shit.  No, Patrice.  That don't even look like Tom Cruise, motherfucker.  Patrice isn't even one of those guys. 
[01:11:00]  He just really enjoys the hell out of what's going on, man.  Dude, Tropic Thunder was tremendous.  And then when I went to see, we went to see the, what did we see together?  The semi-  No, Cloverfield.  Cloverfield.  Oh, Cloverfield.  And that's why you got to go with Patrice too because then if the movie sucks, he's  going to tell the whole fucking theater.  Who the fuck was the big movie reviewer next to us?  That Jeffrey Lyons.  Jeffrey Lyons.  Who hated my guts.  Because he liked the film.  Yeah.  Jeffrey, this movie stinks. 
[01:11:30]  And he's like, what do you know?  Yeah, he's on a dial.  I'm watching it like you, stupid.  Yeah, I'm sitting here watching it.  What do you know?  What do you have that I don't have?  I don't know when a movie's good or bad.  Fucking critic.  I, but Jeffrey Lyons was so annoyed because right at the end of the movie, all of a sudden  Patrice goes, skip it.  And then Lyons turns and goes, who asked?  No one asked.  No one asked.  And then they just start battling with each other.  Oh, that's fucking hysterical.  Thumbs down, asshole.  Yeah.  What do you have to say to that?  I hate these critics that think they just know more than we do. 
[01:12:00]  Shut up.  He has some kind of fucking what?  And when I say we, I mean all of us that go to movies.  How does he get more information?  What, did he see more than you did of the movie?  Right.  That he can make a better judgment on it?  Shut up.  I miss Siskel and Eva like you wouldn't believe.  They got these two new sissies that just, at the movies?  Yeah, Roper and...  No, Roper's gone.  Roper's gone too now?  It's a young sissy and his other idiot.  What is it now?  It's like, wow, really?  Where did Roper go? 
[01:12:30]  A smarmy bearded guy.  Well, Jeffrey Lyons' son is a big movie reviewer now too.  Oh, they just...  Yeah, he's a big movie reviewer.  Because the thing about movie reviews always, it's like, do you have to not like a movie  that has to be not liked?  Can't you go, like, Friday the 13th Part 3 was great?  Can't you do that?  No, you can't say that.  Hell no.  You gotta be like, oh, more of the same, more...  Why can't you enjoy that fucking movie?  Mass murder drivel from...  And why do women always objectify... 
[01:13:00]  Like, can't you just enjoy the movie that gave him his mask?  Like, just enjoy the movie that gave Jason his mask.  You know Jason's an icon.  You know he's a big...  But can't you for the...  Like, just go, okay, for what it's worth, I enjoyed this one.  The remake, does it always...  Like, do I have to guess all the time?  Yeah, yeah.  Give me a fair, like, objective point of view, you know?  And then they throw, like, shit, like, you know, I just loved Stella Got Her Groove Back.  It's the story of a woman who thinks... 
[01:13:30]  Because they're supposed to like those movies.  Well, you know, I found out about Ebert, he never gave a black movie a bad review.  Oh, because he loves...  His marriage was black.  Well, his wife was black.  He loves the chocolate.  He never gave a black movie a bad review, no matter how bad it was.  He's part of the Bill Burr group.  He's a Bill Burr group.  He's part of that Bill Burr group.  I enjoyed it.  My girl is at the Bill the Bear group.  Bill the Bear.  I love...  For now, it's the Bill Burr group. 
[01:14:00]  It's all-encompassing.  If you marry a black woman, then you're part of, like, this little conspiracy thing where  now you can't, like, trash the black movies.  Amazing movie, Soul Plane.  When I saw Soul Plane, I thought it was fantastic.  Two thumbs up, or my wife will stop giving me some of that.  A puss-a.  A puss-a.  Best black comedy is Let's Do It Again.  Friday was hysterical.  I thought that first one was great.  Friday was a great one of the top ones, and I'm still waiting for the quintessential black 
[01:14:30]  gangster movie.  That's all I'm waiting for.  American Gangster didn't do it.  Didn't do it?  No.  It fell short, huh?  It fell short, but I'm waiting for that.  That's all I'm waiting for.  And the best comedy in general, I would say, white, black, anything else, Midnight Run.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I got to see that again.  I still watch that one and just laugh.  I got to go see that one again.  Something from fistophobia.  You don't get on that fucking plane. 
[01:15:00]  I think Charles Grodin, as an annoying person, is the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie.  So fucking annoying in that movie.  It's so real how annoying it is.  Just picking at him, he wouldn't stop.  I think that was...  That was the good part about that.  It was like De Niro wasn't trying to be the funny guy.  He was more the straight man in that one.  And he wasn't goofy. 
[01:15:30]  It was just a fun little action movie.  Yeah, yeah.  Like Dennis Farina, just I'm going to stab you in your eye with a pencil.  The guy's on the phone.  The other guy's just punching in the arm.  The other guy's punching in the arm.  It's just a funny film, man.  I'm going to go see that.  It's just a fucking funny movie, man.  It makes me laugh.  I'm grabbing that one.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah, one of the best comedies on TV right now is East Bound and Down.  Danny McBride's character of just the...  Hold on.  Of just the perfect ass is just incredible. 
[01:16:00]  Well, he plays Kenny Powers.  I love that show.  Yeah, that's good.  You got to see East Bound and Down.  Danny McBride is a superstar in the making.  He's going to hit big time probably with this show.  Yeah, there's a little part where he's just short on camp, so he's trying to sell his sports memorabilia.  And you got to also realize he hasn't been in the scene or popular for probably five or six years.  Right.  And he's trying to sell the only bat that he ever hit a home run for, for $5,000 on eBay. 
[01:16:30]  And it's sold for what?  And it's sold for like $7.  Yeah.  You watch East Bound and Down?  That's good.  Patrice.  I know we want that.  You guys got to watch it, then we can have a discussion about it.  I think somebody, yeah, I got to watch it.  Somebody said it was really good.  It is really funny.  It's like John Rocker trying to get back into the scene.  Yeah, this guy's like a, yeah, he was a great pitcher, a relief pitcher, kind of like a John Rocker, just an asshole.  And now he's down on his luck living with his brother's family, trying to get back into the majors, but doing everything wrong, doing coke, steroids, just getting hammered. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, he became a substitute PE teacher.  Yeah, my favorite part is when he's driving around town, he pops in his motivational, his book on tape when he was, when he was great.  He listens to his own book on tape?  It's his own book on tape.  It's his own motivational speaking tape that he listens to.  Yeah, you guys got to see it, then we can have a proper discussion.  Yeah, I got one to come on, Sunday? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, I didn't see last night's episode.  I DVR'd it.  I'll check it out today.  Thank you, Rob.  Absolutely the best show on TV, though.  Absolutely.  Speaking of, we started this with WWE wrestler Tess found dead in his apartment.  You kidding?  And we opened the paper today, and just out of nowhere, Ron Silver died of cancer.  Yeah, Ron Silver's dead.  He was one of the big stars of, what, the West Wing?  Yeah.  Time Cop.  He'd always turn up and shit.  He was in a million things, this guy. 
[01:18:00]  That was my favorite, Time Cop.  Time Cop.  I didn't see Time Cop.  Died at 62, he had the cancer, the big C.  The big casino.  No.  So he's dead.  And now Stryker wants in on the death pool.  Stryker.  What's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I don't know if you guys caught the one, the MMA star who founded Tap Out Products.  I think he was on the show once.  He died in a car accident last week.  He was drag racing somebody, and he was killed with the other drivers in jail on like a million dollars bail. 
[01:18:30]  Oops.  Wait, he was on our show?  I think he was.  What was his name?  I thought he was on somebody who was affiliated with Tap Out.  We know his name?  We'd have just somebody.  I can't picture that pitch.  Hey, we got somebody from Tap Out Products that wants to be on the show.  There was probably more to it than that.  Like, fuck that.  Yeah, he was drag racing.  All right.  What was he racing?  All right.  Anything good?  Well, Patrick Swayze, man.  He got.  Oh, here we go. 
[01:19:00]  What do you got?  He's melting away.  Prime time.  We were pitching him.  We said no.  Ah.  Oh, we did say no.  Yeah, he was part of this reality.  He wore makeup.  They always saw him in the UFC audiences.  He was one of the Tap Out dudes?  Yeah.  They called him Mask.  He wore the makeup coming down from his eyes.  The tall one?  I know which guy you're talking about.  The Afro wig one?  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe.  One of the two of them.  The Tap Out guy?  Yeah.  The three Tap Out guys?  Yeah.  His name is Charles Lewis, by the way.  Yeah.  Charles Lewis.  I watched that show.  One of the three Tap Out dudes that owned the fucking thing. 
[01:19:30]  He's done, too.  Hey, we're working on our new intern, David, bit.  We're going to have David do internship reviews.  Oof.  He keeps it because he does keep an eye on what the interns are all doing.  Oh, he certainly does.  On Wednesday, intern David will come in with his internship reviews of the other guys that  he actually works with.  He's not their boss.  They all are equal.  Because you took him out of the executive intern slot.  So that's why he's not their boss.  But he's going to give the rest of the interns their reviews on Wednesday. 
[01:20:00]  He honestly bosses these guys, or tries to.  The guys don't listen to them.  But I heard him the other day going, yeah, grab this, make copies of that.  This needs to...  And I'm like, he's throwing orders around at these people, and he's nobody.  So now he's going to review these guys.  And on their strengths and weaknesses.  He looks over people's shoulders when they're doing stuff to make sure they're doing it right  in comments.  Who the fuck is he?  Well, he's been here a little while, so...  Yeah, a little. 
[01:20:30]  Let's acknowledge that David and Bobo show was a huge hit Friday, by the way.  I was laughing my ass off.  The replay of that was hilarious.  Bobo is gold.  Yeah.  They're a good team.  Just gold.  And Stalker Patty, with her horrible improv, the whole thing worked on Friday.  She was perfect as a whole.  Yeah.  Like when somebody said, you know, oh, you want to smash a two-by-four across my head?  What are you talking about?  Why would you say that?  And Patty goes, that could injure somebody. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Like the perfect whole response.  It was beautiful.  We were only going to do that show for 10, 15 minutes.  I think we did like 30 to 40 minutes because it was going so well.  Yep.  So, it's fantastic.  But intern David will be doing his internship reviews on Wednesday.  That'll cause some tension, to say the least.  By the way, Eastbound and Down, the season finale is next Sunday.  They only gave him a six-episode run.  Oh, that's it?  Six lousy episodes, right. 
[01:21:30]  You think they'll re-up him or something?  That's what they do anyway, though.  I never heard six.  It used to be eight, right?  I think there's only six for everything for them.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  How about, nah, Lucky Louie was longer than six.  All these shows on HBO are longer than six.  I don't think they give them 13, do they?  I don't know.  Well, eight?  Well, it sounds like the buzz on this one, it'll come back.  I think so.  I don't know what the ratings are doing, but the buzz on the show is good.  People are definitely digging it.  How do they, what do they care about ratings on HBO anyway? 
[01:22:00]  Because it's just, it doesn't, like, how do they even...  One person's watching, or, you know...  I have my fucking cable.  Yeah.  Like, they don't judge it by, I pay my cable, and then subscribe to HBO, and it's...  Yeah, I never understood that either.  Sean D in Connecticut, fair enough.  He goes, Opie, your choices in shows stink, because I like Eastbound and down?  What are you, nuts?  Then he writes, you never mentioned Always Sunny in Philly, Breaking Bad and Burn Notice.  Also played Apollo on the Larry Roast. 
[01:22:30]  Fucking great.  Yeah, can we get Nick Apollo's roast of Larry the Cable Guy?  Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  He's very funny.  Yeah, Travis is, like, trying to push it on me.  Really funny.  I think we got the box out.  I gotta finally dip into that.  Why, Nick killed on that thing there?  I had to.  I didn't get to see the roast after we promoted it all week.  I DVR'd that shit, too.  Don't forget, tomorrow, St. Paddy's Day, live, Connelly's, 47th and Madison.  That's the headline.  Be there at 8 a.m.  We're gonna be broadcasting live.  A lot of shenanigans planned, and we got Colin Quinn and Rich Voss helping us out tomorrow. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  So we'll see you there.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony with Patrice O'Neill.  Here's your headlines.  Here's your O&A headlines for today.  You got Jim Norton on Leno tonight.  You got his broadcast live tomorrow from Connelly's, 47th and Madison.  At 8 a.m., we'll open the doors, and we'll have some fun as you get ready for the St. Patrick's Day Parade.  Later on this morning, you got Cat Von D coming in studio.  The Tattoo Broad from L.A.  Tattoo Chick.  I actually watched that show. 
[01:23:30]  I love that show.  Yeah.  It's amazing what they could do with a picture.  It's ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  And we're gonna have her look at the staff's really, really bad tattoos.  Yeah, tats are one thing that can really be great or completely awful.  Yeah.  And I've seen some really bad ones.  Eastside Dave has...  On some staff, yeah.  Eastside Dave has the worst tattoo ever.  We were just discussing his Sopranos tattoo.  I'm hoping he comes in early so she can take a look at that horrendous...  I can't even call it artwork. 
[01:24:00]  His Sopranos tattoo is...  It should be up on one of those worst tattoo sites.  Yeah, definitely.  It should win.  Doesn't even look like the Sopranos.  And then for the first time in...  God, I would have to say two years.  Jay Moore will be live in our studio.  Wow, today?  Yeah, today.  Jiminy Cricket.  When we first started XM, I think he...  No, I know he came in.  And he hasn't been in here in a long, long time.  Yeah, it's been a while.  So we'll say hi to Jay a little later this morning as well. 
[01:24:30]  Jackie Mason.  This is a big story.  Oh, the other headline.  Our pal, Don Imus, it was just reported on the news, has stage 2 prostate cancer.  Jeez.  Can we get maybe...  Can we get Dr. Steve on the phone?  I want to know what this stage 2 prostate cancer is all about.  I know the prostate cancer is all about getting it early.  Getting it early.  Giuliani, he had it.  You get it early, it's pretty much a guarantee you're going to be fine. 
[01:25:00]  But Frank Zappa had it too, and he kind of ignored it, I guess.  Yeah.  Stage 2, where's that at?  I don't know.  Once it starts spreading from the prostate into your hip bones and things, then you're  pretty much fucked.  A goner.  Well, that came out...  That literally just hit the news, so we're going to get Dr. Steve on the phone and see  what that's about and if our pal's going to be all right.  Jackie Mason in the news.  This is a big story.  Big story.  Jackie Mason doing his thing.  He's like Uber Jew. 
[01:25:30]  He's Uber Jew, and he doesn't have a problem with stereotyping and doing a little racist  thing here and there.  Oh, he's a comedian.  Yeah, for the sake of humor.  I think he's free to talk about stuff like that.  Why not?  Well, Reverend Al Sharpton's after Jackie Mason now, and Jackie Mason's like, he ain't going  to fold like everybody else.  Reverend Al, I'm starting to feel sorry for him now.  He's picking these causes that no one gives a shit about.  Ever since Obama really started campaigning and looking like he was going to win, Reverend 
[01:26:00]  Al kind of became irrelevant.  Right.  What was the last thing he was protesting?  Do we even remember?  Yeah, he did the cartoon.  Right, right.  The cartoon and the paper.  And what did that get?  Did the guy get fired?  No.  It proved our point.  Yeah, that if you just leave it alone.  You hang in there.  These people get tired, and they go back to wherever they come from.  It goes away, and now he's on Jackie Mason, so who cares?  No one's good.  You could get a crowd to show up anywhere. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  And you could get a crowd to show up a second day.  By the third day, all of a sudden, the crowd's a little less.  Fourth day, it starts to just, you know, fade away on its own.  We should do that experiment.  We should do the show up, Opie and Anthony, just show up, a crowd, outside the station.  Every day.  Every day.  And we'll see how long it takes.  I guarantee the first day would be huge.  Second day would drop off drastically.  By the third day, we've got three idiots out there.  There's no one left.  He had three friggin' lunatics.  It's just how it is. 
[01:27:00]  I think we did that.  It was called the walkover.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, show up every day.  We'll be broadcast live from a sidewalk.  I wish we had, like, bosses with a set of balls just to show, like, say something ridiculous,  see what happens, and then just say, look, ride it out and watch.  We should purposely.  Watch what happens.  That should be our next bit.  Yeah.  We're going to purposely say the most outrageous thing ever.  Uh-huh.  We're doing this to get pre-barred and the rest of them on our case. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  And we're going to ride it out, ladies and gentlemen.  And ride it out.  We're going to ride it out.  As the protesters are marching up and down outside this building, we're going to ride  it out.  Unfortunately, we're not the ones that have to ride it out.  Right.  It's the goddamn bosses that fold.  But look at what happened.  Reverend Al went after the post and wanted the artist fired for his cartoon.  Right.  Nothing happened.  Right.  So now he's on to Jackie Mason.  Well, this is what happened with Jackie Mason. 
[01:28:00]  A legendary funny man, Jackie Mason, is getting jeers for referring to President Obama with  a Yiddish word considered by many to be a racist epithet.  No.  During his act Thursday night at Feinstein's at Lowe's Regency on the Upper East Side, Mason,  72, caused some fans to boo and walk out when he called Obama a schvatsa.  A schvatsa.  A schvatsa.  That's been used forever, man.  That's what the Jewish people call black people.  A schvatsa.  Which is Yiddish for black.  You're right.  I'm an old Jew. 
[01:28:30]  I was raised in a Jewish family where schvatsa was used in unapologetic, Mason told TMZ.com  Sunday night.  I was raised in an Italian household where another word is used.  Our old boss used the word schwoogie.  Yeah, he did.  And to this day, we don't even know if it's a real word or not.  I have no idea.  We assumed that was another Yiddish word for black.  Yeah.  The boss threw that around like it was nothing. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Like it was nothing.  It's not a demeaning word, and I'm not going to defend myself.  Mason then went on a rant about racism, saying, if it's a racist society, the white people  are the ones being persecuted because they have to defend themselves.  The Reverend Al Sharpton noted that in 1991, Mason apologized for calling former mayor David  Dinkins a fancy schvatsa with a mustache.  Maybe it was the fancy and mustachioed part. 
[01:29:30]  He found offensive.  And then Sharpton went out to say, at this stage in Jackie's life and career, he should  get our prayers more than our responses.  Ah, there you go.  Uh, we got the audio of Jason, uh, Jason, geez, uh, Jason, uh, uh, uh, Jackie, sorry.  Wow.  Uh, Jackie Mason.  This is what he had to say about the whole thing.  So you had a show in New York last night?  Right.  Yeah, so, um, I heard that you called Barack Obama a schvatsa.  Is that anything you want to comment about?  I'm not answering these stupid questions because you're trying to multiply me into a racist. 
[01:30:00]  I called a lot boys, the Jews, and the Italians, and I don't worry about what I call people,  and if it bothers you, you're a moron.  Okay, so what else?  Everybody knows I'm a comedian.  I don't, I don't dislike anybody.  Of course you don't, but why is it that you chose that term?  You're f***ing jack-off.  That's what I do for a living.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm a f***ing jerk-off.  Yeah, I think that's what he said.  Nice.  Uh, yeah, the guy was just trying to set him up.  Do you use that word? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, use the word.  Who cares?  Shut up.  I'm a comedian.  Good for Jackie Mason.  You know, Obama's in the public eye.  He's the president.  And if Jackie Mason, as a comedian, wants to use Yiddish words like that, fine.  How many words can't you use anymore for this guy?  Jesus Christ.  What?  It's got to be Messiah?  second coming  brilliant, well-spoken, well-dressed  well-groomed  lovely family  can't say one goddamn bad thing about this motherfucker 
[01:31:00]  but seriously, isn't saying all those  things really the racist comment?  of course it is  you have to reinforce it  like, wow, he's the only  black guy that's like this  I must say  why don't you ask  what's his name?  get in the car  the comedian  someone's just trying to push him in the car  so he doesn't fucking self-destruct  ask Kid Rock  I don't know  he was meaning Chris Rock 
[01:31:30]  what's that guy, the comedian  what is his name, Stone  Kid Rock  Johnny Stone, what's that black guy  what's that sports  what does that mean  I think that's a racist thing  he was gonna go  but this is what I'm saying  like, come on Jackie  don't go into  like, tattletale victim mode  that's it  yeah, yeah  you can't  stand up to yourself  don't fucking  you can't try to blame someone else  those niggas get to say 
[01:32:00]  what they want  that's the thing  I'd ride all day long  with white people  complaining  if you don't bring in  woe is me  yeah, don't try to  please don't  please, not woe is me  like, look at how we have to  struggle now  in this world of unfairness  are you fucking  eeny meeny money moe  catching nigga by the toe  why don't you suck my dick  like, just go with it  Jackie 
[01:32:30]  and deal with it  don't bring Chris Rock in  oh, he can say this  but I can't  I didn't  I brought the kid to rock in  7,000 year old Jew  like, that said things  his entire life  now somebody presses him  and now he's  he's upset  and he's gonna bring  a black guy's name  and that gets to say  that's the thing  why I never wanted to talk about  none of this shit  because that's the one thing  that black people  at least had  is we did get  complete ownership  of language  that's the one thing  we got to do  is I didn't insult anybody 
[01:33:00]  anytime, anywhere  and that was like  an unwritten reparation  that was like  we can't give you money  but I  you know  I'll give you  hip hop  we get  we get to  like kind of  enslave white children  mentally  and  and  comedy  we get to  like say anything  we want to express  how we feel  right  and  it was a quiet  little deal  we had  with society  now  it's like  this fucking guy  Jackie Mason  who has 
[01:33:30]  been around  probably said anything  he probably knew  what's the Jewish gangster  he probably knew him  oh yeah  that guy  you know  Hyman Roth  he probably knew him  or whatever  and  now he's  what about  the kid rook  that disrespectful shit  now it's like  I would be on his  on his side  if he would just  stand up like  an old man  but he's not  he's going out  like kicking and screaming  like a bitch  and I'm like  that's why  it's hard for me  to pay attention  to white people  because it's like  I can't roll with this  yeah  the  the 
[01:34:00]  the persecute  the plight  of the white man  and I talked about this  when I did the show  that time  you guys let me do the show  when y'all was off  is  I  this guy sent me an email  that was like  dude  you don't understand man  you don't understand  what it's like  and I go  did you just like  imply that there's a plight  to the white man  right  and I asked that  and there's white people  that believe  that there's a plight  and for me  as a black guy  it's like  look I don't mind  you complaining  but please  don't forget  who you're talking to  I 
[01:34:30]  I do believe  in this day and age  there is a plight  of the white man  I don't think  it  I wouldn't compare  either deal with it  or don't  don't force me  to like  go  oh yeah  I'm not going to use it  to try to  you know  make anyone else's  plight seem  less  yes  like that  but there's  absolutely a plight  the white man  is pretty much  the only  group that you can  really goof on  these days  with complete impunity 
[01:35:00]  and it's a pretty  it's a pretty new  plight though  I don't know  I mean  it wasn't a plight  during Jim Crow  like that's the thing  I gave it the last  ten years  no longer than that  you think  more than ten years  there were so many  black comics  doing that white  voice  years ago  that white voice  thing  where honey  I'm mowing the lawn  and for some reason  that's funny  because a black guy  is doing it  oh look  he's imitating  a real white person  yeah you're right  about that  I think that's  where it started  but then it slowly  started  digging into  like sitcoms 
[01:35:30]  and commercials  when you watch  commercial  and you see  it's always  there's like  now because  every commercial  has got to be  interracial  so there's like  a white woman  and her good  black friend  over the house  and they're looking  at their two  incompetent  black and white  husbands  out back  barbecuing  as they're  exploding the  propane thing  and they're just  oh our men  what idiots  well if you watch  so it's  somehow  it's kind of  transcending 
[01:36:00]  even just whitey  it's just men  it's destruction  of men  yeah  and that's what  I'm saying  I don't  not all of us  the banana  in the tailpipe  for me  yeah yeah  my thing is  banana in the tailpipe  I get very  annoyed  at  just  the victim  is  I can't  you gotta talk  to me  and make me  feel better  about listening  to a white guy  be victimized  because  socially  you can't  be white  no more 
[01:36:30]  like meaning  you can't  just run  around  being a white  guy  which means  being autonomous  yeah yeah  like back  in 40  like 1940  or 50  or whatever  you're hanging  a nigga  right  this is  this is the  this is the thing  you didn't even have  to explain  hanging a nigga  it was pictures  of a nigga  hanging  by a tree  on a tree  or something  with  with people  taking the shout out  all the guys  are just kind of  standing around  yeah yeah yeah  and you didn't  you never had to  explain that 
[01:37:00]  right  like now  all you really  have to do  is explain  being attacked  for being a racist  like now  you're  the only crime  that you ever  have to face  now  in terms of this  of being a plight  of a white man  is fucking  explaining yourself  if you're accused  of being  the worst thing  a white guy  could be  which is racist  right  other than that  though  that seems like  quite an easy  world to live in  it's a  it's just to 
[01:37:30]  explain  it's a scarlet  letter now  though  you can't  you can't  you can't  explain away  if you're  if you're  tagged a racist  now  you can't  explain it away  I was watching  I guess  what the hell  is that  Greta Van Susteren  on  Fox  one of them  and she goes  and let's go  to our expert  Mark Furman  and instantly  I'm like  that's the  nigga guy  from the  OJ trial  Mark Furman  like how long  ago was that  but still  in my head 
[01:38:00]  it was like  oh  there he is  he's the guy  that blurted it out  and had a  you know  be persecuted  about that  and finally  20 years later  he's got a gig  on Fox News  because people  kind of  I guess  let him  you know  get a job  but I  I'm  a lot of times  I'm on the side  of just  fair  I really am  like the  the Imus thing  the fucking  the Michael Richards thing  fairness to me  is  I'm a reasonable 
[01:38:30]  motherfucker  yeah  and I was on stage  in Denver  and I did a joke  about  I said look  it's  you know  let's be happy  because you can just  you know  I was adding  some of the new shit  you can get attacked  by a chimp  you can get  you don't know  what can happen  and I go  you can be lost  at sea  and even worse  you can be lost  at sea  and be black  and then  I said  people  oh  I say  if I go sailing  I'm taking a white  baby on a keychain  in case my boat  go down  and you will  look for me 
[01:39:00]  while my boat  go down  you ain't calling  off the search  anytime soon  that is awesome  now people  were like  and I go  listen  you don't have  to be black  to know  that they look  for these two  niggas  for a day  and a half  the search  was off  I know  they died  but if it was  a white baby  or a white  teenage girl  you'll be still  looking for  don't  don't fucking  leave me  white people  because I said  that 
[01:39:30]  fair is fair  that is great  aren't they still  looking for that  Natalie Holloway  of course they are  Nancy Grace  everyday  has some  white baby  Natalie Holloway  or a white baby  Natalie Holloway  is gone  her ghost  is saying  I'm dead  and they're like  no we're gonna  find your body  don't you  don't pay attention  to her ghost  there's a few  big black guys  just floating  out there  somewhere  these motherfuckers  did the  like they did  the fucking  hand over  the eyebrow  twice  from the shoreline 
[01:40:00]  them niggas  couldn't have  lived  you know what I'm saying  but it's like  just don't  just be fair  there's no need  for you to go  be defensive  because I said  they didn't look  for no niggas  they didn't  if you watch  the news  black children  just don't go  missing  they don't go  missing  nobody crazy  they don't go  missing  Nancy Grace  has a white  baby on TV  every day 
[01:40:30]  now what that  does  is it makes  me go  come on  bitch  enough  yeah  I don't  it's like  not that  you don't  feel for  a fucking  dead baby  you just go  are you serious  every day  this baby's  more important  than everybody  else  everybody else  it's fair though  because you guys  get the convenience  store robbery  guys  there was a white  guy that was  missing in that  thing too  and the story's  kind of fucking  crazy  they are dead  but it's just 
[01:41:00]  Natalie Holloway's  dead  gone  so dead  she's dead  where the fuck  are the black  football players  parents  wondering  what happened  where'd they go  my son  he was in  he was in  NFL  where is he  what happened  well we assume  they're  you guys sold  into sex slavery  we assumed  their net worth  to be about  a quarter tank  of helicopter fuel  then we went 
[01:41:30]  back  and  they searched  for these niggas  for a day  and some change  give me this  white baby  I'm renting  white babies  to take sailing  with me  and I'm here  I'm going down  that's crazy  that's really good  what about fucking  John John Kennedy  they sent out like  Navy destroyers  to look for  the fucking radar  submarines  submarines  just to get  the body back  every kind of 
[01:42:00]  fucking military vehicle  and here's the  unfair statement  because I like to  think like a white guy  I get  took it over  well  John F. Kennedy  so basically  you have to tell me  that if I'm  look  look for me  don't let me  just be dead  in the sea  fucking send  the troops  send that motherfucker  with the giant  diving bell helmets  and they'll walk around  and the iron shoes  and you walk  and then 
[01:42:30]  they would walk  the entire ocean  to find  John John  oh hell yeah  they would have  a bunch of those  niggas with the  giant helmets  just walking  at the bottom  of the ocean  that little plane  and they found  every one of them  inside there  that little plane  they had  radar  and they weren't  even sure  where it went down  radar  sonar  fucking submarine  submersibles  robots  fucking second tier  football players  you get  sorry  who goes there 
[01:43:00]  sorry  some fucking  tourist with a  snorkel  any missing  black guys  going once  hello  hello  football  black guy  you out there  be quiet  for a second  no  alright  turn around  we're going in  I'm starving  it is what it is  you don't have to be  a fucking black person  to know how unfair 
[01:43:30]  that is  I'm not a rambling fool  they look for white people  till the end  white baby on a keychain  make me laugh all day  god damn  all fucking day  there's a part two  to the jackie mason thing  I want to squeeze in here  the show is going to be  flying by  we got jay moore coming in  kat von d  lots to do  but more on jackie mason  and listen  yeah  one of his people  trying to just get him  in the car  get him in the car  shut him up  I'm not saying  why don't you ask  ruck  what's his name 
[01:44:00]  I can't get in the car  the comedian  what's the comedian's name  ruck  ruck  ruck  what's the reason  what he said about white people  what the names  he would be saying  about what somebody called bush  okay what he has a black person  what the only has white people  i'm not asking you to  you  i'm telling you  you and that's it  that's what it is to me  that's right  okay well jackie  i still like your show man  i'm used to watch you  on back in the days  on show seven  of a lowlife  trying to pretend  that i'm some kind of a  i'm never said  you were a racist  but you're saying 
[01:44:30]  that  you're implying  that i've never made that statement  whatever i said doesn't mean anything  because i'm a comedian  that's my business  well comedy is your life  i'm not mad at it  bravo to jackie mason  bravo  he went off  holy shit  all that  all that stress that built up  after making caddyshack 2  finally got to that  jackie mason  that awful movie  he finally had it  i wish it was pat cooper  i am  oh wow  it was uh... chris rock  uh... kid rock  kid rock 
[01:45:00]  kid rock  oh you know what  i gotta go to mongo the trucker  mongo  um... so patrice  basically what you're saying  is if it's a black person  the coast guard spends an hour  playing marco polo  marco  oh god  that's so fucked up  that's it  yeah you know  i could definitely  replace marco  with something else  you don't like stuff that an ass  uh... 
[01:45:30]  derrick in miami  derrick  homo the dorale  phil mickelson won that damn thing yesterday  if anyone cares  go ahead derrick  the most racist commercial  on tv right now  is a basketball commercial  it's an anti-drug commercial  and a black kid's playing basketball  and a white kid offers him drugs  and ruins his life  yeah yeah  i haven't seen this one yet  you've seen this  yeah  it's uh...  it only plays in bizarro world  where  it's the world of  everything's backwards  yeah i saw that one though  yep 
[01:46:00]  that's a real commercial  yeah black kid's playing basketball  and this white  dude uh...  sells him drugs  and ruins his life  what  the paradox  the paradox is  so ultimately  we reverse it  yeah  the black drug dealer  and if we make it  the black drug dealer  there's a white basketball player  that the black drug dealer  yeah  is gonna ruin his life  and ruin his basketball career  solid  fucking god  they really do  they've become overly cautious 
[01:46:30]  with commercials  how they place black people  in commercials  because now  it's um  it's this whole thing  where  they have to show  uh...  black family  and it's like  hi  we use at&t  and it's a wonderful service  and you're watching  like the  the white dad comes in  and the white kids  are all  oh my new phone  thanks dad  and and it's  it's just  it's a white family  but they're black people  but this is the thing  they've lost touch  with any culture  i don't think  that black people  the thing is 
[01:47:00]  the corruptible  power thing  it takes people  out of fairness  it makes people unfair  where like  you can't joke about  ages anymore  and they were  them and indians  were number one  on the joke list  i mean  i still can though  they haven't really  start fucking  with what i do  like on stage  and i get to say  what i fucking want to  but like on radio  definitely on radio  and on tv  but once  fucking  a group  says  this is not fair 
[01:47:30]  and someone folds  they don't just go  okay  we attacked him  just on this  this was unfair  yeah  anything  they're waiting now  because  for the next one  don't want to be  second class citizens  no one wants to be  second class citizens  even nerds  and every  everybody wants  a voice now  when only the  a-list  motherfuckers  gotta had a voice  yeah  chinese people  on a  they weren't  a-list when i came up  no  you teased them 
[01:48:00]  yeah you did  you didn't torture them  you teased  you teased them  you know who have been  troopers over the years  the polish  the polish  have been goofed on  relentlessly  forever  and  never  got together  if you take away  how many polacks  does it take  if you take that away  from society  then it's wrong  we're doomed  it's so wrong  speaking of that  go into a bookstore  how many polacks  go into a bookstore  and try to find  the polish joke books  oh yeah  man have times 
[01:48:30]  changed  you used to get  that as a birthday  gift  yeah  you can't find  that shit anymore  it's a polish joke  oh it's buried  maybe in some of  the bookstores  if you look  hard enough  that used to be  front and center  comedy man  i think there's  some things  in the past  five years  if i say  any  you know  black causes  like you know  when i go  out of all the  things that were  in the  in the  in the  in the  fucking headlines  yeah  you know  i don't know  how to go back  to them  but i'm sure  if i did  something  i'll go  you know  what  let's pick  one of these 
[01:49:00]  to be  the thing  that we would  go after  i mean  uh  you know  anything  where somebody  possibly could be  being lynched  right  yeah  let's go on that  guy gets dragged  in the back  of a fucking  pickup truck  yeah  let's go after  that  as a  as a thing  but let's not  go after  fucking  imus  and let's not  go after  then it makes  people go  oh  yeah  oh boy  it's like  it's too much  let's not go after  every single  fucking thing  we can't do that  the real shit  yeah  the real serious 
[01:49:30]  stuff  just go after  sure  like reverend al  marching for all  kinds of happy  horse shit  bullshit causes  is stupid  he just wants to get  his face out there  not everything  you can't fight  every battle  no  some of them though  you know  you know  nappy headed hoes  i don't know  you know what i mean  like i go  i don't know  i think that was so  blown out of proportion  because the girls  just didn't give a fuck  they didn't care  they wouldn't care  they were told to care  they were told to look  like they cared  they never heard it  never would have heard it 
[01:50:00]  no one would have heard it  and then  sometimes it's his audience  who didn't care  when this fucking guy  councilman wong  yeah  got his name  able to  get someone fired  the tsunami song  that they did  on hot 907  yeah yeah yeah  and i'm like  you know  bad or good  it's like  now this motherfucker  is like  oh they hear me  you think he's gonna go back  he's not gonna stop  he's just gonna  every fucking thing  yeah  yeah  if i say my dry cleaner's chinese  you know what  that motherfucker's chinese

[01:51:00]  you can't come back  on the air  and imitate  the gentleman's voice  you can't just do  the conversation  back and forth  and then he said  and do it  in his voice  uh  without somebody  just jumping on you  oh you're doing  this stereotypical  uh  asian voice  it's like no  that's the way  this guy was talking  you get to be heard  it's just  it's like my girl  anytime  if I ask her  for some advice  and I go  wow that's pretty  good advice  now the bitch  is  is mrs  her new superpower  is advice  you fucking bitch

[01:55:30]  matter of fact  if you take  a bunch of  uh over 70  that uh die  from some other  cause like pneumonia  and you do an  autopsy on them  uh more than half  of them will actually  have prostate cancer  that they never knew  about  ugh  jesus christ  how do we keep  our assholes clean  we throw a hose  in there every once  in a while  what do we do  well um  you know frequent  ejaculation is felt  to decrease the risk  of uh prostate cancer  that's for sure 
[01:56:00]  what that jizz  starts rotting  and causes cancer  in there  i don't know  if it's  prostate  you know  if that prostate  gets congested  and then that  causes some  irritation  that can  convert  some cells  keeps it  working  thank god  yeah  keep it working  i keep squeezing  and pumping  and pumping  my fucking  clean prostate  thank goodness  one thing i did  right  over the years  since i was 13  there's only one sperm  sitting in that  motherfucker  now what's the uh  what is stage 2  and stage 1  and what is this  that he's got stage 2 
[01:56:30]  yeah well there's uh  four stages of cancer  and uh  stage 2  is a reasonable place  to be when you get  diagnosed  that means it's  locally advanced  meaning that it's  it's invaded the prostate  but hasn't left  the prostate itself  oh  oh so that's good news  yeah that is good news  i mean if you're going  to be told you got  prostate cancer  it's good news  it's still uh  very curable  yeah that should be  uh  pretty treatable  all right so we shouldn't  be boohoo and imus today  not well not yet

[01:57:30]  i've had several  people survive that  yeah i don't understand  the inner workings  of the body  because it's just a  it's just a glob  of stuff  so  bunch of goop  so why can't we  just like create  a glob of stuff  to replace the bad  organ  yeah  well that's common man  i mean with stem cells  uh you should be able  to in theory  create a whole new  organ  master race  yeah  master race  there you go  uh another  another part  that was uh  in our  that great film  too by the way

[02:00:00]  terahawk girl on school grounds police arrested this man twenty-year-old alex edwards  yesterday he drove down to see a fourteen-year-old terahawk girl police say the two of them  have had been having some type of relationship since april of last year edwards admitted to  police of having sex with the girl back in august do you think there is a big age difference  between the two of you  there's a little bit of one but it's  looks like the same as a twenty-year-old and a twenty-six-year-old almost 
[02:00:30]  edwards remained in the vigo county jail tonight with a seventy five thousand dollars bond no ten percent  he faces charges of sexual misconduct with a minor  edwards will be back in court monday  jesus no ten percent they really said fuck you  how old was uh... she and she's fourteen twenty and fourteen and he's twenty  going on school grounds and i think he  he proposed to her  he went to her middle school to propose  yeah  aww that's romantic 
[02:01:00]  right on a potato puff she had a potato puff in one hand and a wedding ring  his engagement ring in the other  wait that's getting into something you don't have a problem with that  um... no i think i actually had one of those  like uh... i was twenty  i'm pretty sure she was fourteen  yeah  yeah but you know  believe me  she really didn't look fourteen  i'll give her that much  and i didn't act twenty that's for sure  is there a statute to statutory  uh... i didn't say i fucked her or anything 
[02:01:30]  i did but i didn't say it  jesus  his quote though is great though because he goes  he goes  it's like what if i was twenty six and she  it's like if i was twenty six and she was twenty  and he goes  almost  yeah  no  see that's legal  wow  where's cat  is she around  yeah let's go  let's get cat  she's just hanging out  cat von d from uh... la inc  a show i dvr  and she's got a new book called high voltage tattoo 
[02:02:00]  mmm  we were just thumbing through this and uh...  for a guy that doesn't have one tattoo on his body i'm obsessed with the tattoo  cat von d  i think when they're done really well they look really good  what's up cat  yeah  there's some horrific uh... tats out there but  i gotta tell you i bought this book and i'm so bummed because i could've got a freebie  but that's cool though right  yeah  so now you know that i i'm a fan  thanks  instead of sitting here making believe i know what this is all about  well um... i'll sign it for you and you can sell it on ebay if it helps 
[02:02:30]  yeah i'll put my money back that way  i'm just kidding  we were just uh... we were just talking about uh... uh... uh... tats and uh...  what i like about the show is you take this picture  and then it looks like the picture on the body  and i can't figure out how that's done  yeah that  that really is amazing because you just see so many  horrid  yeah  tattoos out there  and so when you see a really good one  that's shaded  and and almost like pops out at you  like a face 
[02:03:00]  yeah  that looks like a painting  or photograph  you're like wow that is good work  yeah  there's a bunch of really great portrait artists  and i think when a portrait is executed properly  it just  i mean it's pretty mind-blowing  and i was saying before like i don't understand i always thought it was like  either  either that ink gun is on or off  it's either going on you know  whatever colors in there or  nothing  and then to see the shading  like and it's shadowing and things like that  how the hell is that done 
[02:03:30]  very carefully i guess  really what do you got like a light lighter touch or something  no i think it just has to do with like technique you know um  and everybody tattoos differently obviously  yeah more light-handed than others but  in the end it's just like  how you approach tattoo  yeah you have you have a bad tattoo on you  um bad as in not done well  yeah  oh i have a lot of them  i have my whole like  my left leg um if there's a picture of it in the book it's like the yearbook leg and i have like all my friends who don't even draw tattoo me  it looks like a drunken three-year-old got a hold of my leg but they're so cool because they're like the most endearing tattoos ever 
[02:04:00]  yeah  endearing  yeah you know like it's cute  my mom tattooed me  really  yeah she was like she's like 55  what do you just like give them the gun and go here go ahead have a field day on me  um yeah you know i mean like i kind of you know obviously you know give them gloves and do all that  well yeah  and then i kind of show i showed my mom like how to hold it for a second and she just did a little word on me so  um and it was cool because it was in in the city where i was born in mexico 
[02:04:30]  and i hadn't been back there in like 11 years so i brought my mom with me and uh  i made her tattooed me in front of like 5,000 kids  she put her little glasses on and she was all cute about it and she wrote uh like a word on my leg  and it looked pretty good pretty good good job mom  how did it start with you like i know  um just punk rock music hanging out with the wrong crowd i guess  yeah  yeah  and then i'm sure you get asked all the time where is the first one  um it's on my ankle it's a j for my boyfriend at the time named james and i still have it 
[02:05:00]  yeah  yeah  obviously we broke up you know like three years later  you went very safe  and then cause yeah right  some people  i don't regret it i don't care  some people are addicted to getting tats  um yeah i mean there's no physical addiction but yeah  yeah  they do like  yeah they like the feeling of it and just getting more  you put yourself in that category  no way i hate how it feels  really  dude i suck at getting tattooed  you just like you like the results  yeah i love having them i hate getting them  wow that's fucked up 
[02:05:30]  a lot of people like getting them  what does it  what does it take to get your face tattooed  um what do you mean  just i mean like  meet me as a person or  yeah like that's  that's kind of  that's a big step  that's a big step is what i'm getting at  i mean any other tattoo technically you could cover it up with a shirt and all that  whatever  but when you start going up on the neck and  your hands and stuff  you know that's  that's  that's that's brave  yeah um i you know i think for me i've been tattooing since i was 14 years old so like  um it's definitely a lifestyle so you know it was safe i guess quote unquote for me to get 
[02:06:00]  it done but i don't i definitely don't tattoo faces unless you know i know the person really  well i know they're not gonna you know be looking for a job like the corporate office or  something you know because  don't you think corporate uh offices are starting to accept a tattoo finally  yeah i think i think more and more like with the help of like things like the book or the show  you know it tends to open people's minds up a little more and view it as an art form right  but i think certain negative stigmas are never going to be  completely diminished you know  right yeah you have it not because you know you're who you are and so you're walking around 
[02:06:30]  with tats is you know it's who you are and you got the show and everything like that but  uh once  everybody watches the show so sometimes you go to like some of these cities like  you know on my book tour special i've noticed it's like  i stick out like a sore thumb for sure oh yeah but you know what it is it's not like it's going to affect your your livelihood or something like that if you decide because i see on your fingers and hand like anything that you can't cover with uh a long sleeve shirt or something like that you pretty much are  eliminating the possibility of of getting a job in certain or being a president or something 
[02:07:00]  now believe me i'd take a tatted guy over uh what we got now  oh jeez oh where's my little bell i don't have my inappropriate bell  yeah well  we have uh we have a bunch of guys on staff that have horrible tattoos  yeah  uh you've probably been i don't know maybe people have done this to you a million times but you gotta see a couple of these tattoos and comment about them  everybody's like check this out  what do we start with  um we can start with everybody really i mean 
[02:07:30]  derek has the worst tattoo  we should definitely  no no east side dave's got the worst  well east side dave i don't know if he's gonna make it  i wish he was here  we need steve  steve should come in  yeah i don't think dave's gonna make it in  but we need butcher and derek and steve  east side dave got a tattoo of the uh soprano cast on his back right  is it on his back  yeah  it doesn't look anything like the sopranos  Drea de mateo's on there right  is she in the tattoo  she's hot  i'm not sure  no i don't think he has her  no  she has a lot of rad tattoos  she has a lot of rad tattoos  she has an ACDC tattoo 
[02:08:00]  nice  but he got i think five or six of the sopranos cast and then in text underneath it says i ordered for the table  yeah  it's the worst thing you'll ever see  i love horrible  but it's making you smile it's good  oh it's good  cause it's funny how horrible it is  derek show up  i mean this is a big honor for dirt  cat fondee  show up  that's cool i've seen like way crazier  huh  it's cool  you like that  you gotta explain the tattoo there derek  what is it  it's d snyder on a microphone  why there's hedwig in the angry edge 
[02:08:30]  you see that again derek  and now i gotta take a look  i like it  no you don't  oh shit  we're just nice  that that's  but that i like it cause it looks like a fucking old guy from world war 2 one  yeah yeah  those faded awful ink ones  yeah it's like done in the traditional style  yeah thanks  derek doesn't want to talk he just wants to show the tat  was that supposed to look like like nose art from like a old bomber plane or something  yeah yeah yeah that's what it was like a chick on a bomb 
[02:09:00]  it failed miserably  i like it  i got it when i was like 18 so  really  yeah  what are you getting out of 19  well there is laser surgery so to fix that fucking horse shit  yeah patrice what do you think of the tattoo cause we're not gonna get it out of cat  well it stinks  but cat is into the the world of um you know artistic positivity  so she's not gonna say the fucking guy's tattoo fucking sucks  but my thing is i like it  my thing is about the tattoos  i look i don't like it to be accepted 
[02:09:30]  it's it's it shouldn't be  it's nice to be tattooed  yeah i i i think people who get tattoos should be against society  that's how people did it  motherfuckers that got tattoos man they were  they didn't give a fuck  now you get everybody got a little goofy tattoo on their foot or a goddamn butterfly  some broad walking on the street with a butterfly on an ankle to represent what  right  or someone or a comic who puts  love  the the the tragedy  the tragedy to show i'm fucking in it 
[02:10:00]  i'm really  i'm in it  i'm not bullshitting like eh  so it's hard for me to know so at least his tattoo stinks  to look like it means something  right  it's not art  it's a fucking mistake  let's uh... let's ask cat this cause uh... she should bring up a good point used to be if you want to be a rebel you have a tattoo  or like it  there was a time when wearing just an earring was like what you was a bad motherfucker you was a bad dude  i thought it was a nose ring what's the big bad ass thing now to really stand out that people are doing  i don't know  i don't know 
[02:10:30]  branding  you know i just i just do tattoos but i don't really know much about like piercings and all that stuff  right right  getting beat up by chris brown you're getting some fucking nice swelled up face  and then you tattoo the bruce says a rebel  and you tattoo that beat up picture on your back  jesus  you're just starting to see like uh... for some reason on older men  it doesn't matter you got like you know the old navy tat  or something like that  mom  something like that  the heart 
[02:11:00]  you're starting to see them now like the women  older women that got tatted up a couple of decades ago  and for some reason that looks sillier than the guy with the you know the tat  uh... yeah i'd like to see a molly the other day uh... i'm uh... the supermarket  there  she's a woman  pushing a cart  and she's got like kids  and she's  didn't take care of herself  and on the back of her neck  is just some tribal tat work  that you know is done when she was probably you know listening to 
[02:11:30]  she had a rose on her TV when she was 18  yeah yeah  now it looks like those vines are growing outside of churches  just  yeah you're just seeing more of that  and i think it is different on women  i guess  i mean i think i think uh...  a lot of people are like what are you going to do when you're 80 and i'm just like  i don't think that i'll be worried about what my tattoos are going to look like when i'm 80  i'm just going to be worried about like not pooping in my pants  yeah you have to take a decent dump every day  you know 
[02:12:00]  and i think i'll look pretty cool like an old wrinkly gypsy woman you know what i mean  of course  it'll be the weird like old lady next door and be like she never comes out of her house  that's gotta look strange on some you know loose skin  i guess  it really does you know  but if you know who you are inside  yeah  who gives a shit what's going to happen when you're 80  i've never cared you know so  do you have any that  i hate when people say that  well when you're 80  do you have any that only um only certain people can see  oh good question  um uh...  well you mean like  well you know what i mean  i'm trying to be fucking  sexual  yeah whatever on your feet 
[02:12:30]  um you know i'm going to have a bodysuit by the time i die  where your clit is a nose  no  on a picture  remember that  there's a couple of really bad ones out there  your asshole's a winking eye  and a whole big portrait of  Marilyn Monroe  yeah i've seen that one  is there really one of those out there  uh... of course it is  somebody's fucking  something like that  what's the worst dirty one you ever had to do  like where you go wow this is just inappropriate but you did it  this is insane  um i don't know  i guess i'm just so desensitized to it 
[02:13:00]  i've tattooed like every body part on the planet  so it's not really  really  kind of like whatevs about it  the guys like schlong and stuff  yeah  that's gotta hurt  yeah  like no one's god damn business  most guys just joke about it  actually  rather than doing it so  yeah i wouldn't even joke about it  that just sounds  i'm gonna get a tattoo of a bigger dick on my dick  painful  where do most people find that  like the most painful spot  um i think the crease where your leg meets your butt  is the worst  really  that seems meaty where it wouldn't really 
[02:13:30]  yeah but it's more based on your nerves  versus like  actual  fatty tissue  because i was always under the impression that  with that  freaking bone  it's like an ankle to me seems like  painful right  fucking painful because it's so bony  girls usually pick the most painful parts  for some reason  yeah  that figures  anyone else have a bad tattoo butcher  yeah  i got a couple but  i got a couple  see we're not all lucky to get a  a tat from uh... cat  this is like a two month waiting  this one is venom from spider-man 
[02:14:00]  this is pretty orange  a little chrome effect on it  this one is really bad  i got when dime bag daryl died  daryl died  uh...  uh...  that's awesome  i love that  i tattooed his wife  yeah  this is my favorite one  what is  oh he's getting naked  yeah he's pulling his shirt off  rah  oh cool  oh yeah that's a big like  a big ugly one  oh i'm so glad she's here  cause he thought that was explosive  oh i love it  yeah  why is he waiting to see like a bad tattoo 
[02:14:30]  it's fucking evil  yeah  it needs nothing  yeah that's what i was going for  oh if only east side dave is here  it's a devil with a watery eye  i like it  what's the waiting list to get  butch is in shape with his clothes on  yeah exactly  i just saw like when you did that  your belly  fucking flopped out  i still haven't lost the weight from the biggest gainer  and no one has apparently  no of course not  i want to see the sopranos tattoo  do we have a picture of it  it's so  well fine  there is not even any way you could  have you seen uh... this side up here 
[02:15:00]  which is hysterical epic failure  uh... like  i gather that picture is supposed to be  man i think most people that try to take on portraits that shouldn't  their biggest mistake is teeth  is the teeth right  always cause you can't outline that stuff or else you look like  you have like  she's sucking on a corncob type of stuff  yeah that looks like a corncob  you gotta know how to do the teeth  but it sucks cause you know like with portraits  it's like people flatter themselves all the time  thinking they can do them  and then they're off by like a millimeter  and it changes everything  it just doesn't look right  it looks just like  what 
[02:15:30]  it's absolutely perfect  that's awful  come on  that is a legendary bad tat  man  what's the waiting list to get a tattoo  i usually don't book out for more than two months in advance  but  it just takes us a long time to actually  get to each email  so once we get to your email  which sometimes takes a year  wow  you know so  it's only two months  what i love about LA Ink  you really personalize every tattoo  it's cool  there's a story behind everyone  and by the time you see the finished product 
[02:16:00]  you're like  yeah and some of them don't even have stories  you know i think like for the purpose of the show  and making it entertaining  you know they screen people with a lot of stories and stuff  but in the end like  i love just doing tattoos that are cool looking  like i want to do a will ferrell portrait so bad  really  from elf  nobody's got it  you know what  east side dave will do that tomorrow  this guy will do that tomorrow  are you working on anything that can actually make ink show up on black people  there's the there's the sopranos tattoo by the way  oh my god that's it 
[02:16:30]  that is it right there  it's so incredibly bad  it's  and it's not here  it doesn't even know what to say  it's fucking keloid it up  dude i don't i can't  i guess that's supposed to be tony cause there's not much hair  you can't even say that  yeah it's supposed to be tony i guess uh... carmella  carmella  there says that a carmella looks like peter chris  yeah  now could you fix that  that looks like henry rollins on the right  it does look like henry rollins  and the one on the left looks very familiar 
[02:17:00]  not a soprano  the feral kid from road warrior  yeah  can you fix that if you  if they came to you  if i came to you  with a shotgun  aww that picture is obviously taken right after the tattoo is done  so once it's healed and you can  some of that stuff will fade  then if i were to look at it i could see if you can  unless the whole thing faded  because we've seen it  uh... that was  over a year ago  which was the way to ask her if it stunk  yeah  is  can you fix it  yeah after it heals up and we see what  well 
[02:17:30]  some stuff you can fix  i remember this guy came in with a selma hayek portrait  it looked nothing like her  and the nostrils were so blown out  there was i couldn't do anything to fix that  i'm like you have to get at least one session of laser and then we can go over it  but  well let me ask you this cat  obviously you can't turn that into the actual soprano cast  what would you do with that  mount rushmore  let's say there's no way you can make it as a soprano cast  what would you do with that  four bowling balls  a giant suitcase  yeah right  no um i mean it just depends i'd have to see the photos and all that stuff 
[02:18:00]  yeah alright alright  just gonna  that's a rough one  that is the worst tattoo ever  i think it's funny though i like it  oh he loves it because it's become you know it's become a bad tattoo  aj aj looks like the winner of the special olympics so  he kinda has a weird look down there  i still like the henry rollins  yeah that's the henry rollins  yeah that's the henry rollins  that is so henry rollins  plus he's making that sling blade face  uh huh  sling blade  can we see sam's please  can we see sam's please  can we see sam's please 
[02:18:30]  oh sam has a tat  yeah young sam's got a tat  this is a good one  let me see it  oh this thing is uh  well it's not bad actually  oh it is good  see and it's autographed by rob zahami  he's such a great artist  yeah i know  yeah that's a good job  thank you very much  wow  and it's gonna age well too  yeah just like me  yeah that's right  that's great  i like sam  do you ever see somebody so pale that you go oh my god this is  the paler the better  yeah like you just go  this is gonna be  yeah but the pale guys  the blank canvas 
[02:19:00]  the pale guys that get the bright colors  those tats are awful  you didn't ask that question  i think so  are you trying to invent ink  that fucking  you know shows up on black skin  well there are  like the pigments that show up the best  it obviously depends on how dark the skin is  but um  it's black and red  you know you want to stay away from yellows  or anything like yellow content because  it turns brown  well no just cause you don't see it that much  because basically  you're this the pigment in your skin is just made out of  um like yellow  so you obviously have more concentrated yellow 
[02:19:30]  concentrated  be careful  you have more a little more concentrated jazz  yeah but you  you're skinny  you could probably do a lot of stuff with it  you're not that black  yeah your arms  you could get some stuff though  i got stretch marks  if i had a better body  i'd fucking get a tattoo  i had it up  i'd tattoo stretch marks  get a battleship on your chest  that's what i'm gonna do  is put on my stretch marks like numbers  and make it like it's a map  just  a couple of ninety five  just make a highway  yeah highway seventy eight  it's a fucking my awful body 
[02:20:00]  let me go to holly  a lot of uh... people want to say hi to cat  let's say hi to holly in florida holly  hi cat  hi  i'm so excited to talk to you  cool  you were such an inspiration for me  awesome  i was um... 36 and i had breast cancer  and  and i was and i live in florida  so you know we don't wear many clothes down here  yeah  and i had the surgery where they take your  they give you like a tummy tuck and they take  the skin from down there  yeah rebuild your breast  sure  so i had major scars 
[02:20:30]  and i started watching your show  and i was like you know what i can do this  and i went and got everything tattooed  my entire breast tattooed  and my entire stomach  and it looks awesome  awesome  in an office  you know so  but now it looks cool  you can't see the scars  and one thing i love about about florida  is you guys have topless tanning  so you can totally show that off on the beach  but i saw one one of your shows one time  you got you and other girls were talking  and you said the only place on your body that you never got one was your chest  yeah 
[02:21:00]  and that was just more of a personal choice  because i think it looks great on some women they wear it well  but for me like i i always think eye contact is so important  and like when you have a beautiful piece like on the center of your sternum  you know obviously that's not where your tattoos but  it can be distracting sometimes  but i i think especially for women tattoos are made to  or they should be used to accentuate the body  so um...  from what i haven't seen your tattoo but it sounds like it it does and so that's awesome  yeah so i just wanted to thank you you were an inspiration  aww you rule  all right thanks cat 
[02:21:30]  there you go holly in florida  you got your i see you got your palms done too  yeah just one  i was trying to see if it worked  yeah  no it was that this is funny because that  that had a hurt  that was back when i used to drink so i was i got wasted because i knew i was going to get my palm tattooed  and uh... i don't remember getting it  but i do i love it i love it  that's cool danny you want to show your tattoo  you want to show your tattoo what is the way to show you is the eight  i think i don't think i have mines of that so i don't know if he didn't represent 
[02:22:00]  it  so i guess an honest and who would be nice  well  where was it  uh... that's a uh... artist named dan hank  yeah that's awesome i love it  yeah he actually does very good portraits by the way he has a visit there's actually a photo of a tat that he's done of jack nicholson from the shining ok  that's like everywhere it's it's so it's so photorealistic really  yeah  and that one  that i have uh...  awesome  that's my italica tat that everybody gives me shit for  that's so funny because i got like my friend um... we always call each other like uh... bad names i guess you know and one day he called me splitalica 
[02:22:30]  and i was like oh my god that's the coolest term ever so i had him tattooed on me  he doesn't have any tattoo he doesn't tattoo he's like a bmx guy but i can  and we misspelled it  i was like is it two l's or two c's i can't remember  i need cat's advice though because i got i got this which was supposed to be it was going to be a yin yang but then obviously i got something else and there's no room now so now i don't know what to do i don't know if i should cover it up or  no why don't you just do the yin yang but make it part of the background  you know 
[02:23:00]  oh shit see  damn yo  just like that  just like that  tation's a genius  now i gotta wait a year and two months  no i would go to that guy whoever did it he's good  thank you very much  you got the best tattoo it looks like  see  danny wins  danny or sam who wins cat  oh sam  remember sam zombie tattoo  nah shut up  you guys both have cool ones  i don't know  whoa  we need a winner cause then these guys will brag for like weeks  i gotta vote steve  i like em both  steve let's see those orchards that you got on 
[02:23:30]  wow there's a reason for  alright whatever  here's steve  steve's got a lot of tat stuff  uh  oh yeah i thought you were  arms are both cover up pieces  the uh  cause i had a lot of  shitty  cover up your arms  i had shitty tattoos when i was like 17 years old  so this is  so this koi fish here is covering up two really bad tattoos i got when i was 17  koi fish are great for cover ups  cause they have texture  yeah cause they're very distracting  and on the underside which hurt like a bitch  is a tengu mask  cool  uh... and on this arm is something i had personalized with a lot of floral art 
[02:24:00]  let me see oh yeah the cross i love crosses that's rad  looks good  and uh...  and then on my leg  please  is this the bad one  what's on it  oh that's so pretty  i like it  purple orchids  she's not gonna treasure anyway  purple orchids  come on  am I too nice is that what you're saying i'm sorry  i'm sorry  she's very forgiving  i've just seen so much worse  it's like  not really  not bad  i think it's done well  yeah  yeah i like it

[02:25:00]  i mean overall what's  i mean obviously there's a lot of tat pictures  yeah it's just like an insider's view on the tattoo world  so it has a lot of do's and don'ts  it has like a lot of like tat  like information on tattoo etiquette  how to find the right artist  how to find the right art  and obviously i've  photographed like over a hundred of my favorite clients  and you can see the stories behind them  right  i probably should ask you that ahead of time  are you still with nikki  yeah we just had our first year anniversary  he's a cool dude  yeah  he does that show all the time  he did the forward for the book  oh nice very cool  he's also in it too  yeah  this chick with the john bonnet ramsay tag  he has two john bonnet ramsay's now

Really?  Yeah, and I think, you know, they just, they got the wrong guy. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, if you wanted to put a fucking, uh, Louis Farrakhan on a fucking arm.  Yeah, you could do that.  Fucking, you put fucking, the mumble, fucking, what the hell's fucking, there's some nigger shit.  Pay a fortune to Adolf Hitler.  I bet you put a red blake in some Africa, fucking, yeah.  What about a confederate flag?  They like those?  No, I can't do it.  Like, like, my sister and I do all the emails when we're doing tattoo approval, so she's  able to, like, weed out stuff that she knows. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, okay.  You know, so I don't really ever have to, you know.  Delve into the controversy of anything.  Yeah, you know.  How about any MS-13, all that type shit?  You know what?  Like, yeah, I mean, most of those guys already have their homies doing it.  And they're pretty good.  Yeah, I love, I love.  The shading on some of those.  Good, I'm not saying anything bad about them, that's for sure.  Wow, that's the tattoo.  That's awesome.  Yeah, dude, that does.  See, those teeth are done good.  Yeah, that's Jack Nicholson from The Shining, like Danny was saying.  Dude, this guy is fucking sick, man.  That's not bad. 
[02:27:00]  DanHank.com.  Go check him out.  He's out of Long Island.  I like it.  Kat, if it's too personal, that's all you have to say.  But you said you stopped drinking.  Yeah.  Do you talk about that?  Why you stopped drinking?  Yeah.  Talk about anything.  I just stopped just because it was becoming functional versus fun.  So I was drinking like, you know, I only drank tequila.  That was my drink.  And I drank like a bottle a day.  Yeah.  Starting at noon.  A bottle a day?  Yeah.  It was easy, too.  It was easy.  But no, I mean, you know, I just, it's just not my style. 
[02:27:30]  And I think I'm pretty business orientated and I like to run stuff very, I'm very OCD,  so.  Right.  It just got in the way of making everything perfect, so I just quit.  And it was easy?  Mm-hmm.  I just couldn't go out for a while, just because, you know, not so much because I was tempted,  but just it was harder to deal with stuff in the beginning.  Do you miss it?  No.  You don't for it?  Uh-uh.  Nothing?  Mm-mm.  Nope.  I'm pretty German.  A bottle of tequila a day.  Yeah.  Those are some times.  Did you at least make some, like, margaritas?  No.  Or were you just like, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh? 
[02:28:00]  Just right?  Glasses.  Just glasses.  Glasses at tequila?  Uh-huh.  Ow.  All right.  God bless you.  Fancy it up.  Lime?  Nothing?  No way, man.  I'd be on the bathroom floor puking on myself.  No salt, no lime.  Wow.  Just...  No, yeah.  Well, I mean, if you're drinking good tequila, that stuff, you know, just gets in the way.  The stuff I really liked was Cabo.  Oh.  No, you didn't like that stuff?  No, no.  Well, I mean, there's, like, I was a tequila snob back then, so I was, like, all into, like, 
[02:28:30]  top shelf stuff.  You had to go all.  Yeah.  Right, right.  With the good stuff.  Yeah.  Or else it's an instant headache.  Yeah, that shit will really fuck up the next day.  Yeah.  Well, if you're drinking a bottle of tequila today, it's an headache no matter what, no?  Well, no, because then you drink in the morning when you wake up.  Yeah.  That's right.  No, but I'm glad.  I wouldn't...  You wouldn't want me drunk.  I wouldn't be here right now.  Missed your appointment.  What's the one that everybody drinks?  What's that?  Patron.  Yeah, is that good?  Yeah, they don't do any sponsorships. 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  Oh, really?  No, Jaeger does.  Is that top shelf?  Yeah, because it's, like, the easiest, most accessible top shelf, but it's not technically...  You know, like, if you go to Mexico, they'll laugh at you, you know?  Oh, really?  Yeah, because it's not...  It's swell down there.  Shoot you.  No.  Yeah.  So, yep.  All right.  Cool, guys.

[03:11:00]  Where's Dean's impression  And you gotta admit  I grew up talking like this  How are you fella  Fucking stupid black comics  Black comics stink  They're so terrible  You ever see a white motherfucking  Take a shit  I'm taking a shit now  Here I go  Plop  Oh look out  But the niggas be like  I'm shitting  Fuck it  Walking across the stage  With the stick up his ass walk  Hi everybody  How are ya  How are ya  Hi pal  Hiya fella  How are ya  How are ya  And then black guys will always go 
[03:11:30]  You know the white man  Keeps us back  And holds us down  Like that's the fucking guy  Holding you back  Why do you make me sound  A little more spooky  No offense  Why do you make me sound  Like a pirate  Like I can't give you  The apartment  We never read your application  Instead of like  Hi sorry  I can't give you  A gated community home  Sorry  Sorry fella  I'm holding you back  I'm the most powerful race  In the world  I'm retarded  I'm so retarded  That you're being held back  That is exactly true

[03:12:30]  That's a fucking  That's it  That's my wife said  That's it right there  Because you know what he is  He's a sore winner  Jesus  Jay I gotta remind you  It's really poignant  We're gonna get Dean Edwards on  For the Tracy Morgan showdown  But I gotta remind Jay  The Seinfeld thing  Oh yeah  I'm curious about this  Because I'm kind of with you on this  We're time to set it up though  Seinfeld will do  We're going to  I just had to remind him  That he wanted to do it  Thank you sweetie  Seinfeld can do like  He can really talk about anything  And people  Just because it's Seinfeld  And they paid $100 a ticket  Will be like  It's so funny  It's so true 
[03:13:00]  Because it's like everyday stuff  And that's my impression  Of a white lady  Now this theory  My white impression is  That's when I do a white guy  I go  Stay with the Seinfeld thing  Because  What do you got a pipe and an ass guy  Yes  It's more like the  What Jay's saying though  Because he's Jerry Seinfeld  He gets a lot of wiggle room  And he's saying  He's not a funny guy  Right  Well I think  I know he's funny  I know he's funny  I'm just saying 
[03:13:30]  He gets a lot of wiggle room  Right  Like name something  Well we need a scenario  No just name a product  Procter and Gamble  That's a company  That's a company  Tide  Socks  Snuggies  Snuggies  What are those?  Pampers  You don't know what a Snuggie is?  Snuggie's been being sold  During the Christmas season  No just tell me what they are  White women's uniform  It's the blanket with sleeves  It's the blanket with sleeves  White sleeves  White women's uniform  Are Uggs  What's the deal with white women? 
[03:14:00]  Uggs  I want to wear boots  But I don't want to be troubled with laces  If I can find something  That's a bit like a slipper and a sock  Put it on my feet  And look like a complete moron  Then maybe I could wear Uggs  I don't know  That wasn't the best example  I want to wear boots  But I don't want to be bothered with laces  How about an Ugg?  This is the shoe wear for the laziest people on the planet  I want to wear boots 
[03:14:30]  I want my feet to be warm  But I don't want to tie anything  I want my feet warm  I want to hit the streets  But I don't want to be slowed down by tying anything  When I get out of the way  Wait, I'll help you along  You would totally  No, I absolutely see what you're talking about  This is what the crowd wants  People would be howling at that  Do a little more because I've got the crowd for you  Okay  What's the deal with socks?  I want to wear shoes  But I don't want my feet inside my shoe  I need a buffer 
[03:15:00]  A DMZ  Between my actual foot  And the shoe  And what's going on with black women?  Which you would never fucking say this  This is completely  Black women  What's the deal with black women and their wigs?  If a white woman wears a wig to work  The entire office says  I think she's sick 
[03:15:30]  Let's hit the button there  Black women wear a different wig every day  You know, that's amazing  Yesterday your hair was four inches shorter  Now today it's nice and long  I never understood hats  I don't wear hats  I'm not a hat-wearing person  It just seems odd to me  That I don't want to go out  And walk around town  But I don't want anyone to see my hat  If I'm comfortable 
[03:16:00]  He's got to make a point  If I'm comfortable enough  With the company I keep  If I go to a fancy place  Then  And only then  Will I take the hat off  And let people see my hat  Is he nailing it?  He's nailing it  I don't know  I'm not  I've done it much better  But  I'm getting the point though 
[03:16:30]  It's so bizarre  I love Patrice  He's my uncle  Do you want to hear a good Tracy story?  Yeah  Me and Tracy are at the Boston Comedy Club  And he comes up to me afterwards  He goes  Yo, Jay Moores  I don't know why brothers  Always put an S at the end of my name  Oh shit  You're that actor Jay Moores  Jay Moores  You want to go get nice?  So I go  Yeah  So we go out  Down by like the fire station  Down there  And he pulls a big joint out  And he can't light  He's like  Yo, Brickman  Give me some shelter  Open your coat up for me 
[03:17:00]  So I open up my coat  And he's bending down  Looks like he's blowing me  And he's like lighting a joint  And he gives me  He gives it to me  He smokes like half of  This is a true story  He gives it to me  And I smoke it  And it feels like glass is going down my throat  And I vomit  Like instantly  And I go  What the fuck was that?  And he goes  Oh, you never smoked PCP before?  You never smoked Sherm?  You didn't smell it?  Holy shit  So I'm not a fag  We finished the joint, right?  And then for like an hour  We're just walking around the village  And we're like  We're punching cars 
[03:17:30]  Like we're just walking up and down  Like Waverly  Just punching out fucking cars  Like  You gotta get yourself a Mercury  So he takes me to that club Life  On the bleaker  I think it is  And it's the all black club  That's downstairs  And I'm the only white guy in there  I mean  You know  You've been there  It's like since the fucking  They signed the fire permit  I'm the only white guy  That's been in there  Okay  And I am  High, high, high  I mean  I never smoked that shit before  Like I'm crazy  He gave you unbeknownst to his  PCP  You didn't smell it?  You didn't smell it?  You didn't smell the PCP? 
[03:18:00]  You didn't smell it?  You never smoked Sherm?  Like  That's what he's  With his hand to his mouth?  You didn't smell it?  I miss my daughter, Jay Moore  You don't have a daughter, by the way  I miss my daughter  She's a big girl  With a doo-doo pamper  You know I miss my daughter  Patrice O'Neal  Yeah  I remember Patrice  When his name was Johnny Carson  What the fuck?  It don't matter  It don't have to make sense  It doesn't  With him  Jay Moore's my uncle  So he takes me to Life 
[03:18:30]  And he orders  Dom Perignon  For like  Every woman in his place  He gives out like  60 bottles of Dom Perignon  And I had just come from  Some bizarre gig  And I was wearing a suit  No tie  But like a suit  And uh  The waiter comes over  And puts the check in front of me  Cause he thinks I'm like  Fucking Tracy's  Accountant or something  Cause I'm the only white guy in there  Tracy goes  Yo!

[03:19:00]  Like feet up in the air  Out?  Out!  Like gone  There was just some waiter  Like putting a check down  Just bow!  I'm the rich nigga up in here!  Bow!  And then the bouncers come out  And they just start  Fucking Donnybrook and Tracy  Like stomping  And I heard the word nigger  And I run out of the club  Cause I'm on PCP  I might have said it  Yeah  So  You ever like do acid  And you're like  I can't believe I said  All of that out loud  So  I'm on the sidewalk 
[03:19:30]  Like just standing there  Like I have no idea  Like how to behave  Alone on PCP  Cause I've only had  Like this  Batman and Robin relationship  With my first PCP experience  With Tracy  So I'm just standing  On the sidewalk waiting  And finally  You know it's downstairs  That club  They grab him by the ass  Of his pants  And his neck  Like he's naked  He's got no shirt on  And they throw him  Up the steps  Like airborne  And this is big Tracy  And he lands on the sidewalk  This is when he was big  Yeah  And they throw his  Fucking shirt at him  And it lands on his head  Like a cartoon  And he stands up  And he goes  Yeah  That's how you get out of

Chappelle  Yeah Chappelle  Chappelle is a guy  That does the white voice  The white guy  The goofy white guy  Go to punchline  But the problem with Chappelle is  Is he does his regular punchlines  In the same white voice  You know why  They don't take  Black people hostage?  I'll tell you  We're bad bargaining chips  And then he does 
[03:25:00]  A white guy voice  He goes  So my friend says  Dave  And then his white guy voice  Is so completely  Out of  The realm of  What could actually  Be happening  That I know  It's not true  Whatsoever  Like  My friend says  Dave  We're gonna get  Pulled over  Dave  Dave  Like you fucking  Drive around  With a guy like that  Really  That's your friend  Your friend  Is that really close  To Neil Brennan  No it's not  To Bonnie McFarlane  Oh shit

[03:51:30]  That you cannot do  John McCain  And you cannot do  Barack Obama  Just because  Like  Just because it's timely  Doesn't mean you put on a wig  And just get at it  How about Charles Barkley  Is Charles Barkley  Any respect for that?  Of course I can do Charles Barkley  Any respect for Charles Barkley?  I can do it myself  Dwayne Wade is great  He's gonna put 50 points  On the Knicks  Of course he is  The only reason I did  A drunk driving  Is trying to get a blowjob  Around the corner  It's the same voice  As Muhammad Ali  But Muhammad Ali  You go up a little bit  And you rhyme more  I don't like the fact  That he has a scientific theory
