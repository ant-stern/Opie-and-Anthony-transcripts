<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast heavily featured a tribute to the recently deceased comedian Patrice O'Neal, a frequent guest on the show.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, visibly grieving, shared numerous personal anecdotes about O'Neal, highlighting his intimidating stage presence, sharp wit, and surprisingly kind heart.  They recounted various experiences with him, showcasing his larger-than-life personality. The segment included playing a news clip mistakenly reporting O'Neal's age as 14, eliciting comedic reactions.  The hosts also explained the challenges of keeping the news of O'Neal's death private before his family was ready and justified proceeding with their scheduled interview with actor Gary Oldman.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to playing audio clips of Patrice O'Neal's stand-up routines, including a comedically altered version of "It's Raining Stuff."  Rich Voss, a friend of O'Neal's, called in, sharing his own emotional reaction to the news and a humorous anecdote about misspelling O'Neal's name on Twitter. Other callers shared their memories of O'Neal, and the hosts incorporated stories about various other comedians, including Bill Burr, Colin Quinn, and Lisa Lampanelli, often in the context of their interactions with O'Neal.  The conversation throughout this segment was punctuated by strong language and frank discussions of sex, drugs, and death.

[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen, so appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  From satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  Hey, dang, over there.  Don't listen to the dang over there.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  I guess we start there, right?  Hi, everybody.  Fuck.  Everyone in radio land.  I didn't sleep too well, so I got like...  I'm tired.  You look wide awake, though.  Now I just usually look.  I'm always tired, so this is my wide awake look.  But it's actually tired.  This is a rough one, bro.  Trying to sleep with your own thoughts. 
[00:04:30]  You don't like that.  No.  You don't like that generally, right?  No, especially in the city, because I was staying in the city, so I didn't have the TV  in the bedroom in the city.  Right.  I just don't have it in there.  So, you know, you just kind of lay there.  Why don't you have a TV in your bedroom?  I just never, like...  Why am I asking you?  Who cares?  Who cares?  I thought about getting it.  Who cares?  I know.  But I just didn't have one, so I had to lay there with my thoughts.  Right.  I don't like my thoughts.  Especially when, you know, it's like this shit. 
[00:05:00]  It's all you think about.  You can't sleep.  It's terrible.  Terrible.  Yeah.  Bye, everyone.  I've never been in this position before.  Nah.  This is a fucking strange world.  Up blows.  I guess we start with, um...  I don't even know, man.  That news story.  That Fox story was perfect.  You like that?  Kevin from Connecticut.  I mean, you know, in the end, we gotta try to laugh.  Kevin writes, Patrice looked terrible for 14 years old. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You wanna play that?  Yeah.  Yeah, play that clip.  Kickstart us and get us going.  Yeah, obviously, we lost our dear friend, Patrice O'Neal.  You're kidding!  This was...  I just told Jimmy and Ant, this was the only laugh I had yesterday.  The only one.  It was just a horrible day.  Because, again, the news.  Because the news.  And, you know what?  Of course.  Of course.  Just listen very closely to this clip. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Sad news tonight from the entertainment world.  Comedian Patrice O'Neal has died.  O'Neal died this morning from complications from a stroke he suffered last month.  The Boston native appeared in September's Comedy Central's roast of Charlie Sheen, where his  struggle with diabetes was a punchline for many jokes.  O'Neal was a well-known presence on talk shows in the stand-up industry and was a frequent  guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  He was 14 years old.  That's a hell of a career.  14.  What were you doing at 14? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  You didn't do all that at 14.  No.  I knew I liked him for a reason.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Squeezed a career into 14 short years.  I was a caddy at 14.  I thought that was impressive.  Amazing.  He's doing stand-up and roasts and radio shows and movies.  14 years old.  Oh, my God.  Twitter was abuzz yesterday.  Well, I guess we got to back up to, you know, Patrice had the stroke on, what was it, like 
[00:07:00]  October 18th?  26.  I want to say it was 20-something back.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  And we all knew at the time that it was not going to be fucking good, man.  And we'd just been all hanging around, just waiting for the inevitable.  Yeah, you kind of hope, you know.  And then yesterday, Jimmy, like, I just knew when Jimmy grabbed his phone and ran out of  the studio yesterday.  But then Jimmy didn't really tell us.  Yeah, I figured you knew.  Which is pretty amazing, because you're way better at it than me.  Because then you told me, and I'm bawling for the first time, and I can't even tell you 
[00:07:30]  the last time I fucking cried.  And then we did the Gary Oldman interview.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was the longest 40 minutes of my life, just sitting here.  And it's a big fucking star.  It turned out to be a great interview in the end.  The reason is, by the way, people asked about it, and they had a legit question, like, why  would you not just say it?  Because I wanted to make sure that his family, because I got the call from Matt Frost, who  is his agent.  Right.  You want to make sure that the family was okay with it, because it's not about getting 
[00:08:00]  the news out there.  It was about what his family wanted.  And he talked to Vaughn, and Vaughn had wanted to tell their daughter, or her stepdaughter  herself.  Yeah.  She didn't want her to hear it, and she was in school.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So she wanted to be blown up on Twitter.  So out of respect for what she requested, I knew the story would be out by the time  we came on today, but the important thing was that she wanted to get to her daughter  first.  So that was why we continued with the show, and I didn't say anything to the guy.  I finally told Hope, because I knew you knew, and I even think Sam could see it, but I 
[00:08:30]  couldn't.  I figured after this show, I'll tell you, as soon as 10 is on, I'll say it.  But at the bathroom, Hope asked me, and I was not going to lie, and I knew it was being  obvious.  I totally got it.  I mean, you rarely run out of the studio with your phone.  Every once in a while, you might have a problem with a gig, or traveling, or someone has to  reschedule on the show.  Test results.  Test results.  But not like yesterday.  Yeah, I didn't want to...  But that was why.  We got some questions about it. 
[00:09:00]  And it was a fair question, like, how could you interview Gary Oldman after that?  But that was...  I was grateful he was in, because it was a distraction.  It was almost a distraction, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think if it was just me, you, and Anne at that point, no way.  I would have wanted to end the show.  Yeah, yeah.  We probably would have abruptly got the fuck out of here.  That would have been a little wrong.  But that was a distraction to have Gary in.  So, you know...  So it is what it is, as a lot of people like to say.  Yeah, yeah.  I, you know, I don't even...  I don't even know what to say. 
[00:09:30]  I mean, I...  It sucks.  You knew it was coming.  I knew it was coming.  You know, he was not in good shape.  And people were asking for updates, but there really wasn't much to tell.  No.  I knew it was really, really bad.  But, you know, again, when the family requests something, or...  Yeah, you got to do what they, you know...  Do what anybody wants.  They want.  So you, you know...  It was just a bad place for him to be.  And I was...  I didn't want my friend to die, but if the option was that, or to live in a bad way... 
[00:10:00]  Oh, I know.  ...to move, or whatever happened...  The strokes are motherfuckers, man.  When you have a stroke in the wrong place, terrible.  Look at Dick Clark.  Like, he had it in the right place, quote-unquote, to live.  Right.  And function.  But if you have it in the wrong place, you're fucking...  Yeah, it's just bad.  Especially someone like him.  You don't want to, you know...  You definitely don't want him that fucked up.  You know?  That giant fucking mind and...  Oh, I know.  ...loud voice to be...  You can't have it. 
[00:10:30]  No, no.  You can't have it.  Just like that?  You can't have it.  It's...  Oh, to continue.  No, no, silenced, I mean.  You just can't be alive and have that not...  No, no.  It's terrible.  We only saw him once.  We went to the hospital the day it happened.  We got a call from Bob Kelly.  Like we told you, you know, we said we didn't know where the hospital was.  We did.  The reason we said that was because the family didn't want people...  And this was legit.  They were afraid that people would, meaning well, would show up at the hospital.  Because what was happening is I know his blood pressure was going up and down, and they just 
[00:11:00]  didn't want people showing up at the hospital.  They didn't want people showing up to make amends.  Sometimes when someone's in a bad way or very, very sick, people show up to try to say,  you know, sorry, or I love you, or whatever it is.  And they just didn't want any of that.  And the doctors didn't want it.  So that's why we didn't know where he was.  But we weren't seeing him.  Nobody was...  We weren't allowed in.  And finally, we went last week.  And we went up and saw him.  And he was, you know, he actually looked oddly.  And people always say he looked bad.  He looked okay. 
[00:11:30]  I knew he was, you know, at the end.  But he was thinner, and he had a beard, which looked better on him than I would have thought.  You know what I mean?  Like, I would have thought Patricia looked horrible on a beard.  He actually looked okay on a beard.  And it was his mom and his sister and Vaughn.  And then a couple of the guys went through and saw him after that over the next few days.  But we didn't talk to him morbidly.  It wasn't, you know, goodbye, bro.  It was none of that stuff.  Because I didn't know at that point if he was able to hear or not. 
[00:12:00]  And there's nothing worse.  Like, you kept all emotions outside the room.  Because there's nothing worse than when you're laying there and people are bawling over you.  It's just terrible.  It's like, how fucking bad do I look?  You know, it's just that you don't want that.  Right.  So, you know, we just saw him for about 10 minutes.  And I'm glad I did.  I'm glad I saw him.  But, I mean, there was nothing to be done.  I told everybody who was asking for him.  And I don't know if he heard it or not.  I hope he did.  Hmm.  Hmm.  You just don't fucking know. 
[00:12:30]  No.  Terrible.  Fuck.  That's really young, though, man.  Geraldo, too.  It's like, fucking.  I know, right?  Mike DiStefano.  It's like, all these guys are young.  Yeah.  DiStefano, was he just under 50?  Yeah.  I think he was.  Yeah, I think they were all in their 40s, right?  Trees is a rough one, though.  This is, uh...  Oh, yeah.  We've all lost people.  I mean, every fucking person listening to our voices.  Oh, yeah.  But, for some reason, this one is really fucking rough.  Yeah, it's kind of a, you know, testament to who he was. 
[00:13:00]  That everybody, uh, is taking it so, so hard.  Oh.  The fucking guy is just so full of life.  He took over a room.  Just fucking took over a room.  Yeah.  Wherever he went.  Wherever the fucking guy went.  I remember when I first met him at NAW, Jimmy brought him in.  I was scared shitless of the guy.  He was so intimidated.  No, Voss did.  I was actually out that day, I believe.  Okay.  Yeah, I met the first day he came in.  Voss brought him in officially?  Yes, I believe Rich Voss did the first time.  I always thought it was you.  No, we had talked about him and stuff, but I think Rich did the first time. 
[00:13:30]  And he came through that door, and I'm like, holy fuck, what is this big black guy about?  I'm going to be trouble.  I was fucking intimidated for a long time.  Probably the first year Patrice did the show, I was always intimidated.  And then you really got to know him and realize that, in the end, fucking he was a softie, man.  Yeah.  And I mean that as a compliment.  He was a softie and had a great heart.  An amazing heart.  A lot of people didn't have good first impressions of Patrice. 
[00:14:00]  No.  I think Bill Burr tweeted that last night saying it was always fun to watch people meet Patrice  for the first time.  Because he was just that, he would just take over, man.  Physically, and just emotionally.  There was no buffer period between where he would meet you and then start giving you shit.  Right.  It was just immediate.  Right.  It really was.  He'd call you out in a second. 
[00:14:30]  Well, yeah.  It's funny you should say that.  You had to have your shit together when he was around.  Oh, yeah.  Because he would call you out on everything from your dumb shirt to your stupid joke.  Yeah.  He would call you out on it.  Yeah.  He was very, a lot of guys, we were joking last night at the cellar.  I said, there's as many comedians happy tonight as there are sad.  You know, guys that he had just really told about themselves.  He could be very harsh, but, you know, the worst thing you could do with him was underestimate 
[00:15:00]  how smart he was.  Like, you know, because he's a loud dude and a big black guy and, you know, and he's silly.  He never minded being silly.  If you argued with him and you didn't realize what a smart guy he was, you were going to  be embarrassed.  Yeah, yeah.  And I watched him embarrass some people horribly.  Like, like, like the type beyond embarrassment of slipping on the ice, the type of embarrassment  where you're stripped nude and you're exposed as being a fraud.  Right.  Like where your entire existence is opened up as being not important. 
[00:15:30]  He was able to do that with just a look, too.  Oh, yeah.  Like he could, if somebody was being stupid, he would turn around, not even acknowledge  the person and give that fucking look to you.  Like, what the is this person?  What?  Really?  They would just dismiss you with one glare.  With that look.  It was fucking hilarious.  I know I never got one over on him, ever.  Never.  Yeah.  Not, not a one.  Colin had a very funny tweet about him.  Can you grab Colin's Twitter feed? 
[00:16:00]  He had, I don't know how many he sent out yesterday, but he sent out one that I thought  was very, did you have it open?  I don't have, no, I don't have that one.  That fucking Mad Magazine thing that you had from a tough crowd is hilarious.  Oh, this is, thanks to everybody for the Patrice O'Neal comments.  One of a kind.  In heaven right now, charming half and infuriating half, then reversing.  Yeah, yeah.  And that really, then reversing.  Then reversing.  It's classic. 
[00:16:30]  Fucking classic.  That is exactly, exactly a perfect summation of Patrice.  I would go home so tired after he did our show, just because he challenged you, man, to be  on your fucking toes.  You had to bring up your emotion.  You had to be in it, you know?  And mentally, I would go home, like, just having, knowing I had the best fucking time  and also just being exhausted from him.  Just how he twisted it.  Twisted shit.  Just twisted little, little things in pop culture that you never thought of before. 
[00:17:00]  And people were last night, they're like, what was your favorite Patrice moment?  I mean.  Please.  And I realized late last night, I can't put my finger on one because I start thinking  of a few and then all of a sudden another five or six pop up in your head.  Yeah.  I guess this weekend we're just going to play nothing but Patrice.  Yeah, yeah.  On this channel, so.  I find it hard to listen or watch videos, like, right now.  I could read shit, like when people tweet shit and they're like, oh, remember this one? 
[00:17:30]  And then you kind of play it in your head and hear the voice and everything like that.  But to watch videos right now, it's still too.  It's a little too soon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You hear that one of him laughing?  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  That's one of my, it's probably my favorite video of him because that, to me, like, that's  the guy I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, whatever, because a lot of people were scared of him.  He was, he was mean, he was laughing.  Oh, God.  But that fucking silly motherfucker, like the guy falling on the floor, genuinely falling on the  floor.  Right.  Laughing at Bobo's dick. 
[00:18:00]  Like, that's the guy.  If you ask me to sum up Patrice and what I know, that's it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In that moment.  And I had a few moments with him like that in our existence together, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  In Brazil, laughing at this guy, Evan, trying to speak Portuguese.  We laughed like that.  And Will, Sylvain, who loved him and was his roommate, when we saw his bunions on his feet.  We all came in and his feet had worse bunions ever.  And we probably laughed like that for 15 minutes.  That was one of his qualities. 
[00:18:30]  I mean, he was tough, but if he found you funny or something, he said funny, man, he  would absolutely give it to you, you know.  Yeah.  He would absolutely make sure you know that was fucking funny.  And that laugh would come out, man.  He wasn't afraid of funny people.  He wasn't afraid to be around funny people.  Funny people never are.  Like, he embraced funny people and he loved being in that environment and he loved being  made fun of and he loved making, he loved teasing people.  Oh, yeah.  More than anything, he loved to tease somebody.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  That was his one thing that he really loved doing.  And he would say it in that schoolyard vernacular.  He would say it like, I just love to tease people.  He's like, you're 40.  He's 14.  14, I apologize.  That's 14.  Yes.  Rich Voss is on the line.  Mr. Voss, how are you, sir?  How's it going?  Hey, buddy.  Well, we're just trying to, I don't know.  I don't know what we're trying to do.  We're here, though.  How are you, buddy?  I've had nonstop anxiety, I'm devastated, and it's all because I spelled his name wrong. 
[00:19:30]  Yes.  Only Rich.  I guess.  Only Rich.  I don't know who had it, but Huffington Post had everyone's tweets.  I think it was them.  And Rich was the only one that spelled his name wrong.  But that's perfect, Rich.  Yeah.  You, coming from you, that's perfect.  Yeah.  He wouldn't have had it any other way.  Yes.  You know, and I didn't even know this, Huffington Post, I'm in there at home lately, and I'm 
[00:20:00]  looking at it, there's some nice whatever tweets, this and that, and I said to Bonnie,  I go, you know, this media, I mean, I'm one of his best friends in the world, and she  said, well, they might have put it in if you didn't spell his name wrong, stupid.  But, you know, like, it's hard for me to show emotions.  You guys know that.  Right.  And when I'm, like, you know, when I get the news in the morning, I'm really sad. 
[00:20:30]  And, you know, I'm trying to go about my day, and I'm in the front lot of Dunkin' Donuts  writing this, and all of a sudden, like, tears and snot, everything's running down my  nose.  But then I'm thinking, well, maybe the Giants will bounce back next week.  So, I mean, it's really probably the most devastated I've ever felt in my life.  I don't know, you know, nothing like this has ever happened, even with anybody in my 
[00:21:00]  family.  You know, I was never as close to anybody as of now in my life in my family as I was  to him.  And, you know, and like I said, in the dumb tweet, the most fun I've ever had in my life,  he was involved.  Norton was involved, you know.  But, I mean, there were times we stood outside of Boston Comedy Club, and people in their apartments  were yelling at us to shut up, you know.  They were hanging out, they were like, shut up, and we're just out there. 
[00:21:30]  Did you feel like you were on stage?  Yeah, it's a four, me, you, Keith, fucking Bobby.  Oh, God.  It was just the most fun.  There's nothing with him but good memories.  Right.  There's nothing but good memories.  Well, the last time I did radio with you guys and him, I was kind of upset he didn't  shut his face as he would smash me the whole day.  And, of course, I'm driving home thinking, well, I should have said this, or I should have 
[00:22:00]  said that, but nothing but good memories, you know.  And the most fun in my life as a comic or a person, the most fun in my life is from being  a comic.  Yeah.  The most fun from being a comic.  I've got to ask you guys something, because what I've heard a lot in the last month or  so is this one really hurts.  And you guys are in a world more than us, although we get a taste of it, where a lot  of, you've seen a lot of guys die young. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  But a lot of you guys are saying, this one really fucking hurts, and I've said the exact  same fucking thing.  This one really fucking stings, and I want to know why.  Well, one, it came out of nowhere.  I had to ask him.  Out of nowhere.  I was going to ask for Jimmy, because you know I articulated it, but it's on a roll.  The last thing you saw Patrice do on TV was that roast.  Yeah.  He completely stole the whole roast.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  Completely.  So, you know, you're at his bar, because he's bigger than life.  You know, and I said this too.  He's what, Rich?  He's bigger what?  Bigger than life.  Right.  Yes.  When Patrice was around, like when we sit at the cellar, and like last time we were there,  we're having a good time, but when Patrice was around, you really had to step up your  game.  It's like, it wasn't like, hey, you know, because if you even, whatever, it was just like the 
[00:23:30]  nucleus of the whole thing.  And I hate to put, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I do.  You're not wrong either, man.  He was, I mean, it really was, he was too big a focal point, too loud a guy, too big  a presence.  Yeah.  It's the worst one.  And I've had a lot of people I love, a lot of people I love have died, but this one,  I think is the hardest, at least up to this point.  And when you say he was the focal point, I mean, we all know people that are just loud, 
[00:24:00]  and you're like, shut the fuck up.  With him, it was effortless.  You know what I mean?  It was, it was, it was effortless with him.  He wasn't trying to force himself into situations or any of that crap.  He was just who he was.  Someone just wrote, the funny thing is, Patrice would be slamming Voss right now.  Yeah, of course he would.  He would.  Yeah.  And that's why I'm going to Myrtle Beach to play golf, because when someone passes away,  all you have to say is, that's what they would have wanted.  Like, nobody knows.  Yes, you would play golf.  That's right.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  And the last time I spoke to Patrice, she said, play as much golf as you possibly can.  As opposed to, yeah, Friday and Saturday nights is when you should play it.  On a night horse.  It was always fun.  We were in, one time we were in Amsterdam.  And, I mean, I was, and so is Norm, but I've been in Amsterdam.  I never went there.  And Patrice, and Brazil with Patrice.  But we were in Amsterdam.  And we're done, we were taping a TV show or doing a show and we're done with it.  And we go, let's go to the window, you know, the red light district. 
[00:25:00]  And Lisa Laminelli's like, can I go?  And Patrice laid into her, like, are you out of your mind?  Why would we bring you?  So now she's in the bathroom crying.  And I figured, well, I'll go in to console her so I can just check out the hot girls going into the bathroom.  And it was like, there was no way he was letting her come with us to the red light district.  Not that we were doing it, we were just going to go sightseeing.  And it just, he never held back. 
[00:25:30]  He never held back.  Yeah, him and Lisa had a really weird adversarial relationship.  And he felt bad about it, though.  At one point, he really, Patrice went through a thing where he felt really bad about a lot of the,  because like most people, you know, you don't sometimes think.  And as you get a couple years older, he felt really bad about that.  Like, and he apologized to Lisa.  Like, he, in Florida, on the young Ron and Paul show, or young Paul, I wish we'd mix it up.  But she was on, and Patrice was supposed to come on, 
[00:26:00]  and she didn't want to be in the room when he was there.  Like, she was scared of him.  Wow.  And he's like, what am I doing?  Like, it just struck him as to how shitty it was that they had that relationship.  And he said he was, I think he said he was sorry to her.  And they made up, and, you know, I'm glad for him that he did that.  And I'm glad for her.  Well, a lot of people in the 12-step vote would call that make it a bet.  Yeah, I understand that.  But he wasn't, you know, he wasn't sober.  He didn't need to be sober.  He wasn't at all.  No, not at all. 
[00:26:30]  But, I mean, it was just, it was always fun.  And I don't think when he did that in Nashville, it was personal.  It was just that, hey, this is dudes.  We're going to go to the, you know, the red light district.  You know, if it wasn't any female, he would have done.  And, you know, he would have been, no, you're not coming.  He gave her a hard time, though.  He gave her his hard time.  And she'll tell you that, and he would have told you that.  Well, I know, but we all give each other a hard time.  We were at Caroline's one day years ago, and I was host.  He was on the show. 
[00:27:00]  And he went up, and his whole set was smashing me and how I slobber.  And he's up there doing his act with a speech impediment.  And I'm like, I was, I've never been as mad as I've ever been in my life.  And I went up there, and I was just like, I couldn't even, you know.  But there was times at Caroline's, we used to do this bit, me and Patrice, where he would go on,  if I was host, he'd go on stage, and he'd show no matter what.  And then I'd go on after him, and I'd start, like, talking with somebody in the audience. 
[00:27:30]  And I would say something like, oh, look at the size of your eyes, one of my dumb bits.  And in the back, you'd hear, Jesus, at the top of his lungs.  You go, Jesus, maybe he has that eye disease, right?  And then I would say something to somebody else, and you'd hear, you go, Jesus, right?  And it was the most fun how we would go back and forth.  And it was so unforced.  He just made it seem like it was supposed to happen. 
[00:28:00]  I remember him sitting back by the, where the comics, where the dressing room is at Caroline's,  just right where you guys come out, and sitting back there and just trashing Rich  as he was doing his act.  He was sitting there going, shut up!  Shut up!  Was he with us that horrible New Year's Eve?  Yes!  And we went to the worst restaurant in our lives.  Yeah, you had a mouth full of, like, herring or some shit. 
[00:28:30]  Wait, was that with you guys then?  We met you and your ex-girlfriend a year ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were off the air at that point.  We all went out.  That was it.  Yeah, it was with Melinda at the time.  Yes.  And we were walking down the street, and there was some homeless people, of course, out on  the street.  And we passed by, I guess, a couple of black homeless people, and then Melinda pulled  out a five and gave it to the white, one of the white homeless people, and Patrice just  laid into her.  He said, oh, look at you, you're a sweet little racist.  And just started fucking pounding it.  It was hilarious. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, we ended up in some shitty diner on New Year's Eve.  How depressing was that?  That was terrible, that diner.  That was awful.  It was very, very bad food.  I was so disappointed.  I had my heart set on some good food.  Yeah.  I got a shitty diner.  Yeah, you're Steve with the one post from the radio show.  You don't want to be with as much as the other one, but the other one, who knows what he's  doing, because he can't make a commitment.  So, yeah, you know, he probably had a fever or something wrong with his finger, so he stayed 
[00:29:30]  in that night.  So we were out with the other full-blown alcoholic, and it didn't really matter what you were eating,  because he was going to throw it up later anyway.  You know, it's odd that you even bring up the fact that the drinking and the fact that  Patrice didn't drink, but the one time, the only time I saw him drink was at a party at  my house.  We were drinking Guinness, and he was like, I want to try one of those. 
[00:30:00]  I was like, oh, fuck yeah, you know.  I gave him a Guinness, and I just remember he sat in that big leather chair.  I have this big fucking leather chair, and no one sits in it in my house.  And he fucking kicked back in this thing and drank a Guinness, and it was just really a  cool fucking thing to hang out and actually have a beer with Patrice.  That was fun.  I don't know if I ever saw him drink.  I mean, maybe in Brazil.  We did Brazil, I think, three times together.  At least twice, I think three.  And he might have, on one occasion, had a few sips. 
[00:30:30]  I don't remember, but he was not a drinker.  No, and the funny thing was, he's such a big guy, and he had quite a little buzz on  after one pint of Guinness.  What a lightweight.  Oh, I know.  He just got that, his eyes were at half-masked, and he got that big smile on his face, and  everything was hilarious.  And yeah, it was kind of cold watching him sit in that giant chair, just drinking.  We were in Amsterdam, and I'm with another comic from England.  I've told this story before from England. 
[00:31:00]  His name's John Sealy or whatever.  English comic.  John.  So a funny guy.  So we're in the Red Lake District, me and him.  And for some reason, I wasn't going in that night.  I just was hanging out with him.  So he went, this guy, John, goes into a window, and he's doing whatever with the prostitute.  Then after, he's smoking pot with her, and the prostitute says to him, what do you do?  And this is, you know, one prostitute out of the million, and John says, I'm a comedian. 
[00:31:30]  And the prostitute goes, you know Patrice?  Out of all the people.  A prostitute.  A prostitute.  In a window in Amsterdam.  You know Patrice, I said, yeah, and then the prostitute said, you made me cry in the  bathroom.  What are the odds?  Just nothing but great stories.  It's devastating.  This is, you know, like Norm says, it's just, it's bigger than life. 
[00:32:00]  No, I said that.  Sorry, larger than life is an expression we've probably both embraced at one point.  Sure.  Between us, we're 90.  That's true.  Uh, so, anyhow, I'm driving to this stupid airport, and when I get to the airport, I'm  going to have to do, I got to do a call, and there's some radio show on Myrtle Beach,  but it's not about this.  So it's going to be, so, you know, it's going to be the guy and the girl, and they're going  to be all happy. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, God.  In the middle of it, I'll probably just start crying.  You know?  And what's wrong?  Well, besides the fact, I'm talking to you two.  That's what I'll tell them.  Well, why not, uh, you know, just...  Just go with it.  Tell them what's going on.  Like, uh, I have to do radio, uh, after this.  I have to do a phone-er for, to promote a gig.  And so, you know, I can't pretend it's not happening.  Yeah, but, uh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck those little zoo crews, the morning shows, if they can't handle a, you know... 
[00:33:00]  A real moment?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, fuck them.  They don't deserve to, you know, they deserve what they get, which is, which is nothing.  Exactly.  Well, that's what they get when I call in anyhow.  A little self-deprecating.  You know what I know you have?  Yes, of course.  It's almost, it's like a number after the World Trade Centers when we, you know, you  guys were in it, and I called in, and you started, for some reason, smashed me, and  they go, oh, we're back.  Yeah, yeah.  Was that how we got back into the jokes?  Going after Voss?  Probably. 
[00:33:30]  I always wondered what the first one was.  Yeah, you got back into real jokes.  As he said, after the World Trade Centers.  Centers, yeah.  Yeah, all of them.  There's a lot of them down there.  Yeah.  The jokes, and the riddles, and then the wacky games, that's when it all started up again.  Did we have wacky games back then?  Oh, we always have wacky games, don't we?  I guess, all right, I'll give them that one.  Yeah, wacky games.  All right, Rich.  All right, well, listen, everybody hanging out, and, uh, well, that's it.  Riddles, people call riddles? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I guess we, we got riddles, too.  We did a riddle, we did a riddle segment, Rich.  Riddled me this, Batman.  Whatever you do, you've got horns in your head.  We'll hold you.  Riddles.  Riddles, what else do you call them?  When was the last time riddles meant anything to anyone?  They're on Dixie Cups.  Right, yeah.  I'll talk to you guys later.  All right, Rich.  Thank you, brother.  Rich Voss, everyone.  Rich Voss, yes.  I guess a lot of people coming in to say, uh, say a few words, huh? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, um, I think, uh, Florentine wants to come in.  Patrice loved Jim.  Ah.  I saw Amy last night.  Um, I'm not sure who else is coming.  I mean, uh, Bobby.  Yeah, the tweets were really, uh.  Bob Kelly.  The tweets were really nice.  Yeah.  A lot of, uh, people, uh, tweeting.  A lot of people I wouldn't have expected, you know.  Like, uh, some, some heavy hitters.  It just goes to show, you know, how fucking great he was. 
[00:35:00]  Uh, well, at least they, uh, in the entertainment, uh, E! Online, at least they've got all of his  friends when they're quoting tweets.  Oh.  But I get, I, I'm not even really mad at it.  It's funny.  It is just.  Oh, really?  It just shows you what dummies, uh.  They can't help themselves.  No.  And I think part of it is they just.  They're like, we need, we need names in their world what names are.  They just don't know.  So they have to go with the, you know, the heavy hitters instead of his actual, uh, you 
[00:35:30]  know, close friends.  I don't see a tweet here from, uh, Norton or Kelly or Voss or Colin.  None of them.  They just don't know.  But it was funny that they, uh, they just chose people who, but Charlie I get because  he roasted Charlie.  Yeah.  He liked him.  Um, but it was, then of course Dane, they started together.  Um, you know, and Sarah's famous and she liked Patrice.  I don't, I don't think they knew each other that well, but I could be wrong.  I love this one though from Seth Meyers. 
[00:36:00]  And again, Seth was just tweeting.  He wasn't trying to get on the website.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rest in peace, Patrice O'Neal.  A day spent watching clips of him online is a day well spent.  Spoken like a guy who spent a lot of time with him.  But again, I'm not faulting.  Right.  Right.  I'm not faulting, uh, Seth because he's just writing a nice thing about a guy he probably  didn't know that well or no.  Yeah.  It's, once again, just lazy reporting, which we talk about all the time on this show.  You could have got some pretty damn emotional tweets about Patrice yesterday. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  But they decided to go with Seth because I guess he's a big fucking star.  What dummies.  Give us a fuck he's a big fucking star.  There were, there were some emotions going around yesterday.  Eon, that one made me laugh though.  That one made me laugh because Patrice just would have said, just, just admit you didn't  know me.  Yeah.  Right.  Just say it.  Right.  Right.  You didn't care.  You didn't know me.  Give a fuck.  Right.  Exactly.  That's the weird, twisting, ironic thing of this whole thing is you, I would love to 
[00:37:00]  hear Patrice's take on his death.  Like, like, and, and, and the, the way people are reacting to it because it would just be stuff  like that.  Like, you don't know what the fuck you, you know, like it, that's what it would be.  I think if you, if you were able to get through his outer shell and this is going to sound  you know, so hokey, but he would absolutely appreciate this.  He would appreciate it.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  He'd appreciate it, but he would fucking make fun of quite a few things.  He was on guard.  Mostly time, but you were able to get in there. 
[00:37:30]  He would call out the fraudulent parts of it.  Oh, absolutely.  He would appreciate people who love him.  He always appreciated people who loved him.  I mean, he really did.  But the, the things like that, and I'm not saying Seth's being a fool.  He just wrote a nice thing about a guy.  Right.  It's a nice thing to write if you didn't know somebody.  Just saying, hey, he was funny.  Oh no, I blame the lazy reporting.  The lazy reporting.  Because they could, they, they, they could have picked through the tweets and, you know,  made it.  And found out who knew him as a person.  Right.  And who knew him as a, you know, and just a performer.  You don't always need just the big name. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, it's just silly.  Obviously from that tweet, he didn't know him as a person.  He knew him as a comic.  And as a reporter, you should know that and go, well, all right, that was kind of nice.  But this guy obviously has no idea who he really was.  He was a human being, so.  The day spent watching is a day well spent.  A day well spent.  Why don't we.  Spending days.  Spending.  Yes, that's a day that was spent well.  Why don't we play something from Patrice?  You got, you got something relatively short, Eric, as we go to break?  Um, yeah, I, uh, I mean, we could go as long as 10, 15 minutes if you got something. 
[00:38:30]  All right, yeah, everything, um, I cut up Patrice's, uh, Elephant in the Room special.  And, um, we've got a bunch of cuts here.  I'd like to focus.  You shouldn't play all of it because, uh.  Yeah, I'd like to focus on stuff he did on our show.  Yeah.  It's a good point.  All right.  Because Elephant in the Room, you want people to buy.  So it goes to his family and his stepdaughter.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to have to figure out a lot of stuff.  E-Rock's pirating it.  E-Rock's like, E-Rock's like, look, I'll be, uh, when the wake is held, I'll be selling 
[00:39:00]  Elephant in the Room on the corner, um, you know, bootleg copies.  I'll sign it.  You know, Jimmy, Jimmy makes a good point.  We all know we could get our shit for free these days.  We all know.  But, uh, you know, this is going for a great cause.  Elephant in the Room.  Fucking download it.  It's going to go to, you know, Patrice's family.  Isn't it ironic that E-Rock's trying to find Elephant in the Room?  Yeah, I know.  He just keeps looking at mirrors going, oh, wrong.  Yeah, if you appreciate it or love the guy, just, you know, do the right thing and actually  fucking buy it today.  Yeah, because-  Even if you have a copy, just buy it again. 
[00:39:30]  There's medical bills and there's his stepdaughter and there's Vaughn who he wanted to take care  of and-  His mom.  I had never met his sister and it was funny.  She, she was nice, man.  She was really nice.  And she, in the mouth, she just looked, she smiled.  She looked-  Oh, shit, really?  Just like Patrice.  It was, I was chilling.  Oh, wow.  I saw her in the hospital.  Um, and I just couldn't believe the mouth.  Like, you forget how specific somebody's mouth is when they speak and they smile and just 
[00:40:00]  the, he was like, that's, it's Patrice.  Wow.  It's very odd to see that in a living person when someone's really sick.  Like, people will be coming in, I guess, today and we'll just talk about Patrice.  I mean-  Yeah, well, what do you got to play to think?  The fans, by the way, can I say, I loved all the tweets and the, they were all nice.  Oh, yeah.  The emails and they really are nice.  And people say, oh, people reaching out is nice.  It is.  Even though you're hearing from strangers, they know you're grieving and people were very  genuine.  Yeah, I only had a block like three people, I think. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  I blocked one.  Total.  I had one block.  I mean, people fucking just, they just get it and understand when it's something close  to home.  You know, you don't fuck with it.  Tomorrow, someone, you know, whatever.  But you know what I mean?  When it's close to you, you just don't fuck with it.  Yeah.  That's, that's, that's the, always been the rule in this world.  Yeah, people have been cool.  They're crying their eyes out out there.  I can't tell you how many tweets I, I read from people just fucking bawling.  Yeah.  All day yesterday.  Yeah, people are very upset.  Um, what do you got, E-Rock? 
[00:41:00]  Um, all right.  I got a short version of Patrice doing It's Raining Stuff.  Oh, that was hilarious.  Is it just a song or is it the whole,  No, the whole thing was too long, but this is, it's right to the heart of it, so.  You want to do that?  Yeah.  All right.  And, and, uh, just for the people that are wondering, yeah, all weekend long here on the  channel, and we're not promoting it for our, we're just letting you know.  Yeah, letting you know, you know, that, uh, all weekend long, it's going to be nothing  but Patrice on this channel.  And E-Rock will be playing his CD in its entirety.  So you can just record it.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  And F to family over.  Way to go, E-Rock.  I tried.  All right.  Here's, uh, Patrice O'Neal.  And just to be tortured like that and just want to express himself with woman song.  Yeah.  I got to say, man.  Yeah, singing the woman song.  And it's like, and like, you know, guys, it's like how real guys change the lyrics to,  like, men, you know.  It's raining stuff.  Yeah.  Hallelujah.  It's raining things.  And it's all wet out here. 
[00:42:00]  Tall.  Uh.  It's wet out here.  Rough and tough.  It's wet outside.  It's raining things.  Oh.  You got to change the words to this.  Wow.  It's raining stuff.  Let yourself get absolutely yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's raining.  Oh.  Hallelujah.  Woo. 
[00:42:30]  Ow.  Ow.  Ouch and ooh.  Watch out, motherfuckers, ooh.  Yeah.  Roll for Jesus.  He was a bad motherfucker.  Woo.  Oh.  And he had to do what he had to do.  Nothing wrong, man. 
[00:43:00]  Rearrange the sky.  So that each and every brother.  Can get out there and do.  Woo.  Uh.  It's raining stuff.  Oh.  It's raining things.  Uh-huh.  Watch out.  Shit is flying around.  Uh.  The fuck was that?  Some heavy shit flying around. 
[00:43:30]  Watch your shit.  Watch your shit.  Uh.  Oh.  Holy shit.  This motherfucker was like,  Queen of the night.  I got the stuff that you want.  My pussy's wet as a shit.  Holy shit.  It's raining stuff.  Oh.  Thank you, Nathaniel.  Oh. 
[00:44:00]  Nobody.  God damn.  We changed the lyrics, but you know.  I think we got a hit on our hands.  It's raining stuff.  The O.P.  The Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  You don't fuck a bitch who thinks she can be number one.  I cheat on my girl.  It's with fat bitches that know what my girl look like.  And go.  Number two is good.  Even number three.  Three, three, three, three, three.  I've been saying, look, I'm a decent motherfucker.  It's because I want some side pussy.  Pussy.  It's because I want other pussy as opposed to yours. 
[00:44:30]  It doesn't make me evil, fool, fool.  Dudes want side pussy.  You're never going to meet a girl whose timing ain't broken.  You know what I'm saying?  I said a pussy smell like mini-virgin.  Ooh, your girl look better than me.  I got no self-esteem.  You're a side pussy.  God damn, you got some nice titties.  Ooh, to put it explicitly.  I'm fooling number three.  You're a side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  What women do have to understand is that we look. 
[00:45:00]  That's a part of our soul.  We don't bleed every month.  We don't fucking sit down to pee.  We don't pop babies out.  The one thing that we suffer with is when we're committed.  And women should understand what commitment is.  It's a commitment to us, not commitment to them.  It's a commitment that I can be not a piece of shit one day in my life.  Um, that it doesn't solve the problem of strange twat everywhere.  One side pussy.  We don't have the tools to fight young, delicious women that say, 
[00:45:30]  Patrice, I'm going to fuck you bad.  First of all, any bitch who doesn't want her asshole licked is an asshole.  Side pussy.  Side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  You hear how delicious that sounded?  Ooh, I'll be your fucky.  I'm not too hard to plead. 
[00:46:00]  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some sound.  That's how Harlem got hooked on heroin in the 20s.  They give you the uncut dope.  And then as soon as you go,  they go,  God, you punk motherfucker.  That's what they do.  And it's not their fault.  It's not malicious.  It's just nature.  That's what they do.  They can't help it.  Nigga, what are you talking about?  Dudes want side pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy.  You won't tell anyone that we  get a fuck or twice a week. 
[00:46:30]  Your side pussy.  Hey, can I lick your asshole?  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  But I'm more nasty.  Ooh, your side pussy.  That's what I say to the milkman, nigga.  Ooh, I want to fuck you bad, Patrice.  How you gonna say no to me?  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Patrice, you got to tell your story.  Oh, shit.  Dude, that is a funny fucking story, man. 
[00:47:00]  That is a really funny fucking story.  Listen to what happened to Patrice  since the last time we saw him.  Yeah, it was like Christmas time.  I had driven home, went to go to Boston for a second.  So I'm driving back.  I'm driving back through Connecticut.  You know you drive and you get that scared tired,  like that tired that you just,  you go, oh my God, I'm getting ready to die tired.  Like, you don't have any more confidence in yourself 
[00:47:30]  that you can keep yourself awake.  Like, you're like, oh damn.  It's cold, so all the windows are down.  Yeah.  Fucking young Jeezy.  Yeah, I'm up, motherfuckers.  And, oh, oh.  Blasting, punching your leg.  And just that type of tired,  where I went to sleep a couple of times.  Oof, man.  So I said I got to find some,  I was getting ready to pull over to the side.  Did you start having the logic in your head  where you're like,  I could close my eyes for five seconds.  Jeez, it's not when you're driving.  You've never done that?  No, I've sat there.  Oh, I've done that. 
[00:48:00]  Petrified, just like Patrice is talking.  I think I can give it just,  all right, just two seconds.  No.  Ha, ha, ha.  I sit there with your eyes open going,  motherfucker, you've got to stay awake.  You've never been ghosting with yourself?  No, no, I have, but it's been.  I said I think I could do a couple seconds here?  No.  Because you're so tired that your logic is starting to go?  No, my logic goes in a different way,  where you're driving, your eyes are open,  you're watching the road,  and you're going, motherfucker, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake.  Stay awake.  All right.  Stay awake.  And then, like, oh, trees, road, sky. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  And you're just out, and then, what the fuck?  I was just telling you to stay awake, asshole.  Like, first you're driving, and your hand is at the bottom,  you know, where your hand is pointed up,  and you're controlling with the bottom of the wheel.  Then when you get those scares,  you put your left hand out the window,  hang out the window,  drive with your hand on the top.  Okay, I'm up now.  Oh, no.  I'm that kind of horrified tired, 
[00:49:00]  so I've got to stop.  I do the Harvey Keitel fucking Reservoir Dogs chant to myself,  you've got to stay awake.  Come on.  I smack myself in the face,  stay awake, stay awake.  You're going to fucking stay awake.  I don't know how, like, the truck drivers,  they must know tricks to do.  Yeah, they know tricks, all right.  It comes in a bottle,  or it comes in fucking a piece of tinfoil,  or wherever the fuck.  Oh, shit.  It's called crystal methadrine.  See, I'm corny.  I really am a corny motherfucker,  because I'm thinking, 
[00:49:30]  boy, those guys, man, how do they do it?  Cocaine!  Coke, crystal meth, whatever keeps you fucking going.  Whatever gets the load there on time.  Oh, my God.  Gets you from wrapping up a family of five.  I'm sitting there thinking they must have,  oh, they channel Yum Curry,  the magical truck god that gives them energy and strength.  Truck god.  Truck god.  The truck god.  There's a truck god.  You snort it through a straw,  you smoke it, whatever.  Oh, my God.  So, I start driving and shit,  and I go, 
[00:50:00]  I see a McDonald's in the distant,  you know,  oh, shit.  McDonald's fucking rest stop.  Yeah.  So, I just do 95 until I get there.  Pull in there,  park,  I go,  thank God,  I lean my seat back.  Now, you know,  what time is this about?  About three in the morning.  Oh, wow.  Way to go, Mr. Jordan.  Wow.  Way to go, Mr. Jordan.  I just always leave late.  I just always just go there and come back,  like,  leave at 12.  Yeah.  No traffic.  I kind of like the no traffic angle, 
[00:50:30]  but when you're falling asleep.  go down to Merritt or 95s from time to time.  Yeah.  So, I park,  I'm parked there,  I put my seat back,  and I drive a Suburban,  and this is nigg it up big time.  Like, you know,  I got 22s,  just so don't fuck,  because I drive in New York.  I will get 24s.  Yeah.  But, you know,  the potholes fuck your shit up,  so I got tent that's like as black as anything,  you know,  and the whole nine,  so, you know,  I put my seat back.  Whew!  Thank God.  Put my skylight up.  I look in the sky,  and shit just fall asleep. 
[00:51:00]  I lean back.  You're probably out in like two seconds.  About two seconds,  but for some reason,  you know,  after about a good five minutes of sleeping,  I just,  my eyes open.  Nothing woke me up.  Just my eyes open.  Not a sound,  nothing.  Just open your eyes.  Oh, boy,  I look to the left,  then I look to my right,  out on my passenger side,  there's a guy looking in my window.  Oh, man.  Clean cut white guy.  Abercrombie and Fitch.  Yeah.  Fucking ties. 
[00:51:30]  Clean hair. </pre>
