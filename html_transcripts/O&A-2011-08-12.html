<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, hosted by Opie and Jim Norton with Fez filling in for Anthony, began with a discussion of their Comedy Cellar dinner, followed by recounting Anthony’s failed attempt to get a photo with Snooki and speculation about the reasons behind it.  The conversation then shifted to Jim Norton's recent experiences: a self-deprecating account of his *Tonight Show* appearance and subsequent M&M binge, and a surprisingly well-received, impromptu cameo on *Louie* alongside Dane Cook.  They praised *Louie*'s second season, comparing its impact to Nirvana's *Nevermind*.

A significant segment focused on the death of Janie Lane of Warrant, found dead in a Comfort Inn. This sparked a discussion about Warrant, other 80s hair bands, their decline with the rise of grunge, and the contrasting fates of bands like Poison and Mötley Crüe.  The hosts analyzed Ozzy Osbourne's career evolution, and debated the legacies of various 80s and 90s bands including Winger, Puddle of Mud, Creed, and Silverchair, incorporating listener calls into the conversation.  A brief advertisement for Elvis Dice Clay at the Holiday Inn Express in Henderson, Nevada, was aired.  Tiger Woods's poor PGA Championship performance was also briefly discussed.

The show then delved into a more in-depth analysis of Tiger Woods's fall from grace, exploring the humiliation of his public exposure and its impact on his life and career. The hosts humorously commented on his perceived "tossability," contrasting his previous image. The conversation branched into golf etiquette and dress codes, fueled by anecdotes about attire-related incidents. A female caller, Marie, suggested Tiger Woods needed a caddy to help him get laid again.  The discussion touched upon his divorce settlement, and the hosts offered their opinions on its fairness.

A male caller, Rob, described finding what he believed to be warts on a sexual partner, prompting a graphic and humorous medical discussion with a fake "Dr. Steve."  This led to several callers sharing their experiences with self-performed surgeries, including removing ingrown toenails, lancing abscesses, and even extracting teeth.  One caller, Melissa, a heroin addict, shared her self-treatment of abscesses and discussed her struggles with addiction and depression, expressing suicidal thoughts.  The segment concluded with further discussion of self-surgery, historical context, and a caller's brother's extensive self-surgery history.

The following segment featured numerous callers describing bizarre self-administered medical treatments, starting with a discussion of a lanced boil splattering on a mirror, with "Dr. Steve" providing medical commentary. Callers recounted their experiences: Heather’s childhood experiences with inadequate medical care, Avi pulling a tooth nerve, Todd squeezing a salivary gland blockage, and Wade sewing up a wound with carpet thread. "Dr. Steve" described Civil War-era amputation techniques.  The discussion then touched upon modern medical advancements like stem cell research and experimental HIV-based leukemia treatments. A caller described self-treating a cyst, leading to an explanation of wound packing.  The conversation then shifted, humorously, to callers' sleeping habits, their attire preferences, and concluding with a debate about the sexual orientation of Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street.

A later segment focused on sleeping habits, ranging from sleeping naked to wearing pajamas, with tangents on childhood molestation (with joking links to sock-wearing), bed bugs, Bert and Ernie's sexuality, and various personal hygiene and sexual experiences.  Callers shared their preferences and sexual encounters, including one describing a girlfriend’s strong vaginal odor. The hosts discussed their views on various sexual acts, and Jimmy's frequent urination and potential Flomax use and side effects. Jimmy's father’s recent passing was also briefly mentioned.  The recurring Bert and Ernie sexuality bit continued.  The segment ended with an advertisement for Billy the Bassman.

The final segment focused heavily on sex and relationships, using frequent vulgar and sexually explicit language. Opie and Jim Norton, along with studio guests Troy, Kenny, and Sam Roberts (who hosted the after-show), engaged in discussions about various sexual acts, masturbation, and personal sexual experiences. Notable moments included detailed descriptions of a guest's masturbation habits and another guest's story about taking a sick girlfriend to the pediatrics ward. A crude recurring joke by Kenny was frequently used. Studio lighting became a topic, continuing into the after-show with Sam Roberts, Eric Nagel, and Troy, along with a caller.  The show ended abruptly without a formal sign-off.  The after-show further discussed lighting and included additional anecdotes and off-color commentary. Jim Florentine, Penn Jillette, Joel McHale, and members of the *Jersey Shore* cast were mentioned as upcoming guests.

[00:03:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it.  The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard.  You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony Radio Show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, morning.  It's me and Jimmy today.  Yes.  Me and you, kid.  And has been the victim of a gay bashing.  Yep.  We wish him nothing but the best.  Poor sweetie.  Poor little fella.  I'm trying to unwrap my dinner from the comedy cellar.  Yeah.  My fucking...  What'd you get?  I got a great tabbouleh salad with no onions, no lettuce, and no lemon, because it killed my reflux. 
[00:04:30]  And then two skewers of grilled chicken.  God damn, they have good food at the cellar.  Yeah, you have to heat it, but I got to take...  I got to put the...  Where do you go?  No, that's tinfoil.  You got to heat that shit up.  Oh, okay.  I'll put it in...  Oh, yeah, this doesn't get heat.  Okay, thanks, Kenny.  Why don't they have microwavable pans or whatever?  I don't know, man.  You can't put that in there.  No.  You'll fuck up everything. 
[00:05:00]  I know.  It'll make that fucking...  That tinny, like...  Yeah.  But I'm happy I have a nice, healthy breath gift.  I wound up going out last night.  I didn't have a spot.  I thought I did.  I'm a day off.  Like, I missed my spot the other night, and I didn't have one last night.  So I just thought I was doing Leno last night by mistake.  So me and stupid Keith Robinson went out for a nice fucking...  I've been going out to dinner and lunch with a lot of friends lately.  It's fucking...  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  Why are you doing that?  We went to Blue Ribbon. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  I just felt like hanging out with him.  Like, I haven't...  I'm like, I don't see my friends sometimes, Alex.  I'm on the road or whatever.  It's like, it's nice just to go out to eat once in a while and fucking...  Just chill out?  Yeah.  I also want to thank Fez.  He stepped up.  He's sitting in today as well.  So we'll do just fine.  We'll do just fine.  Yes, we'll do.  And I think we might move Mars up to the big boy's chair today.  Oof.  So Mars, get your thoughts together.  We're going to you in a few minutes.  Okay.  You didn't get Snooki's picture, huh? 
[00:06:00]  No, they forgot my fucking house dressing.  No, I did not get my picture with Snooki.  Why?  Why?  She's just Snooki.  It wasn't her.  She was running a little late, I think.  I think she had to be on Cosmo at 10.30.  Well, just to set it up, yesterday you wanted a picture with Snooki and you had your luggage  from your LA trip, so you were just kind of hanging around with luggage so you could  get a picture with Snooki.  I had to do some Boneyard stuff because I was expecting to have a guest, but it was a mix-up. 
[00:06:30]  So I had to stay for a couple minutes anyway.  Yeah.  So I'm like, stay for the extra 20 minutes.  And just get her.  She's coming in at 10.30.  I figured 10.20.  So she came in at 10.31 instead of 10.25.  And the booker said, look, I want to get her.  I don't want to take any time away from anybody's interviews, which, okay, that's fair.  But I was like...  You're way too reasonable.  That's where you and I are so fucking different.  How is that reasonable?  I just figured...  Because a picture takes less than a second. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, it's quick.  So how are you taking time away from anybody?  I don't know.  They just...  I think that they felt...  They're rushing her in.  She went right into the studio.  She didn't go to any dressing rooms.  She went right into the studio.  Right.  But I was standing there by the front waiting.  I had my camera out.  And I'm like, I knew I could have waited and gotten it.  I was just too tired.  I had been up for 24 hours.  And I just...  I'm standing like a douchebag.  I'm like, what do you do?  You can't stand in the lobby with your luggage.  Luggage and a camera ready.  Jane Fonda is one thing.  I did that...  When I left for work last week, it's like Jane Fonda I would wait for because I don't 
[00:07:30]  like Jane Fonda, but she is a fucking, you know, a two-time Oscar winner.  Right.  But, you know.  Snooki, by the way, looked good.  She was not...  She lost a lot of weight.  She looked fucking really good yesterday.  I never saw it.  She looked better.  I mean, you...  No, I know, but I never saw that she could possibly be good looking, ever.  So I did not get it.  I was kind of bummed because I was like, the rest of the cast we're going to get this  week.  But I was like, what am I going to do next week?  What am I going to do?  Snooki's easy.  I got her at a Jets game, so she's around.  It's like, just to have it. 
[00:08:00]  Did she have good interviews over here?  I left.  She blew off our show for whatever reason.  Our show has way more listeners than any of those other dumb channels she'd interviewed  with yesterday.  Yeah, that's probably a publicist protecting her.  Not to take away from those dumb fucking channels, but I am.  That's a publicist protecting her.  Cosmo?  How many fucking people listen to Cosmo?  If she would have taken a picture in the lobby with me, she probably would have had the  same audience.  Exactly.  That she would.  But they don't know.  I think they want to get her on the platform, and they probably said no to shows like this 
[00:08:30]  and Howard just because...  Yeah, why?  Because we're going to fucking beat her up a little bit?  I'm guessing.  But we don't.  We didn't beat up the situation.  We didn't beat up Vinny.  She's Snooki.  JWoww.  JWoww we were nice to.  Yeah, we were really nice to JWoww.  We've been nice to all the Jersey Shore people.  Yeah.  Every single one of them.  Yeah.  I should...  She might be...  I don't think it's her.  It's probably her publicist.  That's normally who it is.  What are they trying to polish her up?  Shine her up real nice?  I think they get scared.  I think that...  What are they scared of?  Reputation.  She's on a show... 
[00:09:00]  Reputation.  Have you watched Jersey Shore?  No.  But I mean, I'm just answering your question.  That's what they're scared of.  The first two seasons, she was just drunk fucking everything in sight and rubbing her vagina  on everything.  I don't think they're scared she's going to be associating with unsavory characters.  They're scared that she's just going to be attacked.  Like, they're afraid that she's going to come in...  Well, that's ridiculous.  ...and be attacked.  That's ridiculous.  I mean, we would be respectful, and so would Howard.  Yeah.  Defend him, too.  I mean, it's Snooki.  Watch the Jersey Shore, and then you would see how ridiculous that is. 
[00:09:30]  It is very silly, and she'll come in when she has a book.  Everyone comes through when they have a book.  Dude, she fell down so many fucking times.  She fell down on the sand.  Her vagina was on display for everybody.  You know, what respect?  What is she talking about?  She looked nice yesterday.  I'll say that.  She did look nice yesterday.  I don't see it.  Why did I get this now?  I should have gotten this after.  I'm so stupid.  What are you talking about?  I had my chicken heated.  I can't even eat it now.  You could eat.  No, no, no.  I'll wait.  I've been to my fucking fat stomach. 
[00:10:00]  I've been so awash in self-hatred for the last five days.  Why?  I don't know.  Because I treated myself at The Tonight Show, and I come back.  I'm like, well...  Why are you treating yourself?  I don't know.  I like to have some M&M's.  Why do you treat yourself?  You're a grown man.  No, I fight it.  I fight it.  It's hard not to.  Yeah, but every once in a while, you just go, I don't know.  I'm going to have some ice cream.  But in my mind, it's not treating myself.  I know.  You actually go out of your way to treat yourself.  I got to stop.  Yesterday before the show, Jim's just sitting there, and I look over at him. 
[00:10:30]  Hi, Travis.  Hi, guys.  I didn't recognize you.  How are you, sir?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  And I look over at Jim, and he's just squeezing his stomach.  Oh, you saw that?  Yeah.  That's the first time you saw that?  He's been doing that for years.  No, no, no.  I know he's been doing it for years, but it was because of the M&Ms that he ate.  I'm like, Jim, what are you doing?  We'll be in the middle of a radio show, and I try not to bring it to everyone's attention,  but all of a sudden, I'll look at Jimmy, and he'll grab his gut with two hands sometimes  and go, but not make a noise, and then just pop back up and be funny Jimmy. 
[00:11:00]  It's fucking amazing.  It's like every moment that I'm not doing it, I'm fighting the urge to do it.  Those aren't weird moments.  Those are actually just moments where I slip up.  Yeah.  Sometimes I have to turn my mirror a certain way.  Voss talked about that, like he couldn't walk by the mirror with his dick out because  he hates his dick after a shower.  He would always have to have a towel on.  What's wrong with his dick after a shower?  He just thought his dick looked small.  My fucking penis looks good all the fucking time.  Yeah, but everybody knows that.  Maybe I'm sharing too much.  No, no, no.  Everybody knows that.  I apologize for that.  Okay.  Your nickname isn't a delicious cock kid for nothing. 
[00:11:30]  It could be.  I could model my penis.  I'm telling you.  It's perfect.  It's a perfect shape.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It has a freckle on it, though.  Where?  Kind of like almost near the ball bag, almost near the root system.  One freckle ruins a perfect penis that I have.  Yeah, a freckle's good.  It just shows everybody that it's not actually sculpted out of marble.  It is actually a flesh thing.  So why did you treat yourself? 
[00:12:00]  Because you had such a great Leno appearance?  No, just because I was done with it.  I got so many Jim Norton things DVR'd.  I finally saw your appearance on Louie last night.  Oh, I haven't seen that.  People said it was good, but...  You did good.  Thanks.  Yeah, the whole Dane Cook episode, which was...  Holy shit, was that a great episode.  That seemed real.  Did Louie ever have a problem with Dane Cook?  I don't remember.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Did we talk about it on our show?  Yeah.  Okay.  But I think they made up.  So what? 
[00:12:30]  They decided to just go with it?  I don't know.  I didn't see any of the...  I got called at 6...  That was an 8 o'clock shoot in the Bronx on a Friday.  I get a call from Louie on my old cell.  Yeah.  I happen to have it.  Most times my old cell is not on.  I mean, I joked about the good boy phone, naughty boy phone.  Right.  But I still get calls on my naughty boy phone, which is the only reason I still have it.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck, and I see the number light up.  It's Louie.  So I answer it, and he's like, hey, could you be in the Bronx in two hours?  What?  And I had sets to do, but he's like, we'll come get you.  And I had to go somewhere after. 
[00:13:00]  I think I had to drive for a gig.  Yeah.  I was meeting Kenny late with one of our late Friday drives for a Saturday gig.  Wait, so you weren't even prepared for that?  I got the call two hours before I had to be there.  And then he told you what you were going to do on set?  I just saw the script when I got there, yeah.  But that was easy.  It was only a few lines.  Yeah, but still, man, that's pretty cool.  Yeah.  What happened was I think the guy that was supposed to do it was unable to do it.  It was a replacement for somebody.  Right.  So it was, you know, hey, I was glad I got something.  Yeah, you were hanging out backstage at a Dane Cook show.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  Because you wanted pussy.  Yeah, young pussy.  Young pussy.  No, it was good.  But he's fun.  Louie's fun because when you shoot with him, it's a low pressure.  He always looks like he has no idea what he's about to do next, even though he does.  So you're kind of doing like, oh, all right, over there.  Nah, just stand here.  You want to come a little club?  Nah, right there.  It's fine.  Right.  It's very, very unlike other sets, which is why I think that comes through.  That's probably why it's working so well.  Yeah, it's different.  It's very different.  You know, I don't think a lot of people could just kind of wing it like that. 
[00:14:00]  I don't want to say wing it because Louie's very prepared, but you know what I'm saying.  He knows how to just go with things as well.  Yeah, and I haven't.  That scene where everybody talks about from with Rick Crome, the gay scene from last season.  Again, that was from a comedy star conversation.  Yeah, sure.  At the table.  And an article came out yesterday.  They're praising the second season of Louie.  Yeah.  Praising it.  What do they compare it to?  Nirvana's Nevermind or something like that? 
[00:14:30]  I didn't read it.  Could you get that article?  Because we're discussing it right now.  So you treat yourself because you had a good Leno appearance?  Well, because I was done shooting.  So you had what?  Just a peanut bag of M&M's and a regular bag.  You had to have two bags?  I was so hungry.  I wanted some chocolate.  I never get to eat chocolate.  Yeah, but when you're hungry, you get a sandwich or something.  No, no.  I wanted something bad.  Grant Lamb?  Huh?  Was it the Grant Lamb interview article?  I don't know.  I think that's what it was.  Louie's Brilliant Second Season.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's getting fucking praised. 
[00:15:00]  And I thought there was a Nirvana-like thing in there or something.  What does he say?  I'm going to help Louie winds up like Cobain.  This fall marks the 20th anniversary of Nirvana's Nevermind.  So lots of folks are talking and writing about how life-changing the release of the record was.  But is this just a separate...  How does it compare to Louie?  I don't want to read all that.  What does it say, Travis?  But in 91, Nevermind was not unilaterally appreciated.  People argued about its merits constantly, and a lot of people hated it. 
[00:15:30]  But we generally agree it's awesome now, but that agreement is retrospective.  Louie is not like that.  Right now, Louie is like the Beatles in 66 or DiMaggio in 41.  Oh, so, okay.  Very good.  Good for Louie.  So he's got another season, too.  I thought you were going to do a lot of reading, so I shoved a piece of chicken in my mouth.  I didn't realize you were going to just skim it out.  I'm fucking not reading today.  Fuck that.  Maybe Fez will read for us.  He's sitting in today, and I want to thank Fezzy for doing that, stepping up like he is.  Two shows for Fezzy today.  Two shows for Fezzy. 
[00:16:00]  Seeing Louie's, like a guy like, his sensibilities, and seeing that, like, now it works.  Yeah.  It's very encouraging, man.  He's a guy who's like, he's had things that have come close and not, and I was involved  with one, and then there's others that I wasn't involved with, that have come close and not  gone, and come close and not gone, and then he found it.  Whatever it was, it just clicked.  But it's really nice to see that he's fucking doing what he wants to do and it works.  I think it opens the door for a lot of other people.  Because Lucky Louie on HBO was a great show.  It was, um... 
[00:16:30]  It really was a great show.  I liked it.  It was a different vibe than this, obviously, but, um...  But...  Yeah, I thought it was funny, too.  But, I mean, it goes with what you just said.  He tweaked it and finally found his mark.  You know what I mean?  I was watching the episode recently on Lucky Louie.  Somebody mentioned Rick Shapiro.  Right.  And I forgot.  Again, I don't watch stuff.  I mean, I hate myself.  So I'm watching the episode where Louie was drunk driving, and I was in the back seat of  that, uh, for that scene.  And at the end, Rick Shapiro does the, uh, public service announcement.  Right.  About having sex with the elderly.  Right.  And I forgot how funny that was.  Um, there was some stuff in that show that I just don't remember because I haven't seen 
[00:17:00]  it in probably three years.  Mm-hmm.  It's like, fuck, that was some funny moments with that.  Well, the latest, uh...  Well, I'm one behind.  I'm always behind Louie because it's on 1030 at night.  So, uh, the one that you were in with Dane Cook, and man, he beat up Hollywood with that  whole sitcom thing.  You didn't see the episode, did you?  No, I haven't seen one episode.  Where Louie was trying to do this, uh, do a sitcom his way, and he finally just said,  fuck that, because they want him to, you know, be kind of cute, you know, the cute sitcom  type of guy, and then, uh, the show ends with Bob Saget filling in for what Louie's part 
[00:17:30]  was, and he just beat the shit out of Hollywood.  Oh.  He was making a fucking statement at the end of, uh, that, that Louie episode.  I know if I see it, I'll eventually see it.  I'm just, when you're working, like I said, you're working on something, you don't want  to, you just don't want to fucking be influenced by what's going, I think a problem a lot of  people make is they watch everything, and they know everything, and they don't realize  they're picking up things.  Because that, to me, is why so much of TV is the same, it's because guys are watching 
[00:18:00]  things, and, oh, yeah, and then kind of not realizing they're being inspired, and you  have fucking three shows that are carbon copies of a great show.  Right.  So, I just, in my head, I never, ever want to doubt where something comes from.  Uh, but you did great, man.  Thank you.  In the Dane Cook, uh, episode.  Yeah, I saw Dane.  I got there as he was rapping, uh, rapping for the day, so, uh, we said hello, and...  Oh, excuse me.  I think it was right around the time his play got canceled.  He was, uh, supposed to be doing a play.  He might have actually dropped that.  I know, it got canceled.  Mm-hmm.  It might have been him not wanting to do it. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  But he's supposed to be on Broadway.  Jesus.  All right.  I don't know what happened.  Uh, overnight, we lost, uh, who did we lose?  Janie Lane?  Yeah.  Lead singer of Warrant?  Yep.  He had some problems.  Perhaps some music play.  Is that...  Huh?  There he goes.  I need a request, ready?  This is the one he picks.  Which one is this, E-Rod?  Heaven.  Okay.  Do it every day.  It's a good tune. 
[00:19:00]  Fucking, I didn't realize, I for some reason was thinking Coverdale signed Cherry Pie.  Seriously?  Yeah, it just wasn't...  That's weird.  Yeah.  Not warranted Cherry Pie.  What was the big one for White Snake?  Uh, here we go.  Oh, all right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  No, I never...  That fucking song was huge, man. 
[00:19:30]  Massive.  A massive hit.  And it does everything 80s songs did.  Right.  That chant, like...  But, uh, I think Jamie Lane was another one of these guys that was tortured.  I remember he was on, um, I think it was Celebrity Fit Club.  And they, they, uh, kind of showed you that he had some problems.  Possibly a massive drinking problem. 
[00:20:00]  And they found him in a comfort inn.  A fucking comfort inn.  No offense to the comfort inns out there, but...  Jesus, this guy, you know, sort of had a career.  Yeah.  And then you fast forward a bunch of years and you're dead in a comfort inn.  What the fuck?  It really is hard to maintain.  Like, you forget how many bands.  And of course, I focus on Ozzy because I'm a fanatic, so I always make it about Ozzy.  But there's other bands, too.  There's a few other ones that were able to survive the hair metal thing.  Not many.  And, but, man, most of them fucking grunge killed most of those bands. 
[00:20:30]  Destroyed them.  But what the fuck happened to those guys?  They were done in 1989, 1991, maybe.  Right.  Um, like, Sebastian Bach still looks really good and young.  Like, he's a guy that still goes out and does gigs.  Poison, I think, is touring now.  But I get bummed when I hear these guys.  I'm like, fuck, man, I forgot about Warren.  What are they...  Fucking...  Molly Crew's doing good, though.  Molly Crew's at least on tour.  They've always stayed relevant.  Like, Molly Crew has always stayed kind of...  I think they're touring with Poison.  Oh, right, okay, yeah.  But there were a few bands that went past the whole hairband thing. 
[00:21:00]  And Molly Crew was one of them that was lucky enough to do that.  You know what I mean?  Others were just...  They were put in the hairband category.  And when Kurt Cobain came around, that was fucking it.  That was a tsunami that wiped them all out.  Said so long.  And then they had to sit around for, what, seven or eight years.  And then they sort of started coming back a little bit.  But, you know, never to the point they were at.  That's kind of like how Pearl Jam or Soundgarden eclipsed the grunge category and they're still around. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, because then grunge became its own genre.  But then there were only a few bands that survived that as well.  Yeah, Travis is right.  You don't look at Soundgarden as just a grunge band.  You look at them as a rock band now.  And Pearl Jam is certainly the same thing.  Right.  The ones that stand out from what is considered the...  I'm not going to say shtick because these guys do more than that.  But whatever you want to call it.  I mean, even let's go with your Ozzy.  I mean, when the hairband thing was so fucking hot, Ozzy changed his look to fit the whole hairband genre.  It's fucking...  If you can find a shot in the dark... 
[00:22:00]  Again, an album I like, The Ultimate Sin.  But it's weird to see how guys go through these phases.  And there's a balance you have to keep between adjusting to what you're doing so it's relevant to what's happening in music.  Right.  And selling out.  There's a balance you have to have.  And I think he kept that.  Yeah.  See if you can just fan forward to the stage part.  But this video is so 80s.  What a great song.  I love...  But look at his hair. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Look at the fucking sequin white thing.  I wish he was here right now so I could yell at him for this.  He's got a perm.  Yeah.  Ozzy's got a perm.  I told you it was the fucking Bette Miller years.  When he was in Black Sabbath, he had just greasy, horrible hair.  And now you're looking at him with a perm because that was kind of hot.  But the 80s videos with the chicks with the fucking, you know, that Marky Post hairdo.  Yeah.  Oh, the stage thing with the doves.  Stage going, oh, these chicks are terrible. 
[00:23:00]  It's a great song, though.  Yeah.  We're watching now.  He's coming.  He used to be lower on the stage.  In the lap of this giant fucking, like, Eddie from Maiden-looking thing.  Oh, look at them head-banging these awful people.  Let's say hi to Bill in West Virginia.  Bill.  Oh, Jakey Lee.  Oh, let me see this.  If you're just waking up, uh, Jakey Lee...  Oh, hold on one second.  Sorry.  No, I'm just going...  No, no, you didn't.  I'm looking at the birds flying.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Ozzy's outfits.  I love them.  When did he say fuck all that shit and go back to just being Ozzy?  This was a...  I mean, he was...  This was just a phase.  He kind of...  How many years, though?  A couple years tops?  Yeah.  I mean, he did this.  I think his toenail polish is black.  He's barefoot on the stage.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, if you're just waking up, Janie Lane, the lead singer of Warrant, has passed.  They found him at a Comfort Inn overnight, so...  Yeah.  Oh, is that where he got found dead?  I didn't realize... 
[00:24:00]  What do you got, buddy?  I was going to tell you, boys.  Maybe he got screwed up when he was born, because his parents...  His real name, his parents named him John Kennedy Oswald.  Is that really his real name?  Yeah, that's what it said on the internet yesterday.  That's a hell of a name to go through life with.  Yeah, that's what I thought, too.  All right, I'm going to look that up.  I never knew that.  I interviewed Janie Lane over the years.  Did you?  Yeah, a real nice guy. 
[00:24:30]  Sucks.  He was only 47.  Ah, something.  Jesus Christ.  John Kennedy Oswald.  That was really his name, huh?  We don't know how he died yet, right?  No.  What, um, what usually popular, Warrant?  Because they were like a joke on MTV for Beavis and Butthead.  Uh, I would...  Oh, no, that was Winger.  I'm sorry.  That was Winger.  Uh, Warrant...  No, Warrant was, too.  They used to make fun of, uh, Warrant on Beavis and Butthead a lot.  Well, let's find that clip.  I want to hear it.  No, but they always wear the shirt.  What was the shirt they got?  The Winger shirt?  I think they did the Winger shirt, mostly, right? 
[00:25:00]  What was the Winger song?  Oh, fuck.  They had some big ones, though.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Kip Winger.  What the fuck was the song?  Kip Winger's a terrible name.  Cherry Pie was 1990.  What?  Cherry Pie.  Oh, it was 90.  See that?  I thought it was...  Cherry Pie was 1990.  I didn't realize that.  Are you serious?  Yep.  I did not realize that was the end of Hair...  Like, the end of the, uh...  Wow.  There was a second tier.  I would have thought that was 83.  Every genre has, like, three tiers.  The first tier, you know, the solid bands. 
[00:25:30]  Then you got kind of the second tier.  And then you got the third tier, where everyone is jumping into the genre.  Right, right.  And that's when the whole fucking thing collapses.  Yeah.  That's exactly how it works.  It's too many guys copying the style or just kind of picking up the cadence and not doing...  Right.  Same thing with Grunge.  You had your fucking big hitters.  Who are the originals in Grunge?  Nirvana, obviously.  Pearl Jam.  Nirvana.  Pearl Jam.  Sound Garden.  Mud Honey.  Mud Honey.  If you really want to go deep, Travis is right.  Then maybe the second tier, you got to kind of put Alice in Chains there, believe it or 
[00:26:00]  not.  Because they weren't...  They weren't even a grunge band.  They just decided to go with the whole grunge thing.  Because it was so hot at the time.  And then, I don't know, like fucking the third tier.  I'm trying to even think of...  I'm trying to even think of bands from the third tier of grunge.  Who would that be?  I mean, if you want to make a third tier, you could say like, you know, Puddle of Mud  and Creed just because they were just blatantly ripping off the sound.  I fucking love Puddle of Mud.  No, you don't.  I really do. 
[00:26:30]  There's a few of their songs I really like.  I know.  I probably shouldn't say that.  Eric's suggesting Candlebox.  Candlebox?  Yeah, that's about right.  What's a Puddle of Mud song?  You got one, E-Rock?  Hang on, hang on.  I don't think Courtney Love liked Puddle of Mud.  I think she fucking was furious.  Is that the bodies hit the ground, guys?  No, that's Drowning Pool.  Drowning Pool.  No, because, I mean, they sound like her co-band.  Puddle of Mud had Blurry, She Hates Me. 
[00:27:00]  Blurry's the one.  Yeah.  Hit Blurry?  Hit Blurry.  All right, hang on.  Eric has a goatee.  Ooh.  Eric just hasn't shaved.  Okay.  No, Eric's just depressed like Nicholson in The Shining.  He's throwing a ball against the wall all day.  Fuck him.  Oh, she's only 17, winger.  Thank you, fucking Chris.  Oh, she's only...  Yeah.  Of course.  Thank you.  You don't like this, Travis?  I mean, it's all right.  I fucking...  His voice just...  It always bugged me.  Not only do I like this,  I fucking turn it up when it's on the radio. 
[00:27:30]  It's not a bad song.  I don't know if I've ever heard this.  Is this a Cobain ripoff?  You're going to hear Kurt Cobain in a second.  It's so messed up.  I don't know this song.  Wait for it to kick in.  He starts screaming.  You could be my song. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, you could be my seed.  You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene.  I wonder what you'll do.  I wonder what you'll do.  I wonder where you are.  This ocean's all between us.  That's not very far.  Can you take it all away?  Can you take it all away? 
[00:28:30]  When you shove it in my face?  Explain you get to me.  Can you take it all away?  Can you take it all away?  Huh?  That doesn't really remind me of Kurt Cobain,  but maybe I just don't know enough.  I'm actually getting help  because I haven't thought of Puddle of Mud in a while.  I want to thank Kurt Love.  He's a regular from New York City.  He's a good one to follow on Twitter, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that, Kurt.  He says Heel Overhead is the one that sounds a lot like Nirvana.  Can you give me that one, E? 
[00:29:00]  Sure, one second.  Fuck, I'm going to have to listen to some Puddle of Mud today.  I can't believe you really don't like it, Travis.  No, not really.  This was 10 years ago.  Huh?  This song came out in 2001.  Jesus Christ.  This is the one that sounds more like Nirvana.  Were they the third tier, you think?  Well, I mean, by 2001, it was really over.  But bands like this and Creed kind of, like, you know, took that sound.  I fucking hate Creed.  Nobody likes Creed.  All right, good.  We interviewed them a bunch of times, too.  Fuck, Creed was massive. 
[00:29:30]  Turn this up.  You can hear the Nirvana influence, though.  A little bit of influence, but yeah, it does remind me of it. 
[00:30:00]  I don't like it that much, no.  It's not terrible.  It's just...  You don't like it?  No.  I don't hate it, either.  It just wouldn't do anything for you either way.  Oh, they're saying Silverchair was third tier grunge.  Yeah.  Yeah, you could throw Silverchair in there.  I haven't heard of that, man.  You don't know Silverchair?  They had a shoot song.  Silverchair?  Give me the Silverchair hit.  Turn this down.  We're doing this because Janie Lane from Warren fucking passed.  You know what song was there?  And he wasn't on Celebrity Rehab.  A lot of people think that this is another Dr. Drew success story, but he wasn't on Celebrity Rehab. 
[00:30:30]  He was on Celebrity Fit Club.  Yes.  What do you got for Silverchair?  You don't know this song?  This song was huge.  Giant.  I've never heard of the band.  They actually just broke up.  Me and Ann used to get these guys drunk.  They were underage when they used to do a lot of shows up in Boston.  We would get them beers.  We go way back with these fucking guys.  They're probably 30 years old now. 
[00:31:00]  It sounds familiar, but I think because it reminds me of other songs.  The guy's 32 now?  The lead singer, yeah.  Holy.  He was a 17-year-old kid that wanted beer.  They were one of those baby bands.  They were all teenagers.  Are they still popular?  No.  Unfortunately not.  I thought they had talent, too.  And he married Natalie Mbuglia.  That's right.  Oh, yeah.  Are they still married?  No.  Her big song.  You know this one?  Maybe. 
[00:31:30]  No.  Wait.  You know this one, Jimmy?  No.  Do not.  No.  They divorced in 2008.  How long were they married?  Five years?  What was her big song?  I think it was called Torn.  Yeah.  Torn.  How does that go?  Because it reminds me, me and Florentine did a pilot.  No.  You can pay this out.  I've never heard this.  We did a pilot for VH1, which I was thinking of very recently.  And it was actually, me and Jim were roommates. 
[00:32:00]  And there was three sets of, right, right, this song.  This song was so big.  Because this was one of the songs that we had in the pilot that we had to sit there and  talk about, like, make fun of.  It's a stupid Starbucks song.  Yeah.  That's about chick music in Starbucks.  I don't hate this song, though.  I was.  I know.  I don't mind it, to be honest with you.  This is a cover, Eric is telling me.  Yeah, this wasn't even an original song.  Who wrote the original?  It was an original group.  It was called Edna Swap.  Edna Swap?  Edna Swap. 
[00:32:30]  And it didn't really chart anywhere.  And then she came out with the song, and it went huge.  How long ago did Edna Swap do it?  Boy, she, like, covered this, like, right after they broke up.  Oh, probably.  They were around in the 90s.  It's not a bad song.  I don't know if I'd go great, but I mean, I like it.  I may have had this on tape single.  Oh, yeah, cut singles.  Yeah.  Remember cut singles instead of cassettes?  What an awful idea.  Yeah.  All right, enough of this.  Enough of this.  Get on the floor. 
[00:33:00]  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Sorry, it just really gets me.  It's a catchy song.  There were certain ones I remember from the pilots we did.  We redid the pilot, and then we redid it again.  And the fucking writer they got was so fucking bad.  Yes.  It was almost like a Beavis and Butthead, but with real people.  It was me and Jim, and then there was a married couple, and then there was a gay couple.  It was just being politically correct.  And then we would have little storylines going, and then we would sit there, and they would  play videos. 
[00:33:30]  And we would all, in our own apartment, be watching the same video.  And we would just be talking about it and commenting on it.  But of course, all the fucking really funny comments they made us take out.  And for the pilot, this is when I was touring with Dice.  He's like, what are you doing?  I'm like, I'm in L.A.  I'm shooting a pilot.  He goes, can I be in it?  He goes, can I be in it?  So we're like, okay.  So we got him a scene at the end, completely disconnected.  We were all watching a video at a party.  Yeah.  And Dice is just sitting there being Dobie Dice, where he was like, I don't know nothing. 
[00:34:00]  Like when he would do his stupid thing.  Right.  And he wanted me to grab him by the shirt.  I grab him, and I spit my bubble gum in his face.  I think I slap him, and I spit my gum in his face.  It was very funny, because he says something, and I just go, shut up!  And I hit him and spit my gum in his face.  And VH1 didn't use that in the pilot.  They fucking went with the corny ending that we had.  They're like, we don't think it's like the character of you.  I'm like, you fucking idiots.  Just stop overthinking everything.  This corny fucking L.A. writer they got.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  That's too bad.  I fucking hate these L.A. white guy writers.  They're terrible.  Goes back to the discussion we had earlier this week.  I don't know if you were here.  A lot of movies or, let's say, TV shows that were great on paper, that they just fucked  up as they were producing them.  Because there's too many...  And you just know it now as a horrible movie or something, when, you know, obviously on  paper, maybe that horrible comedy was just the most amazing thing ever written.  Well, Colin...  And you'll never know now.  Colin wrote, what's the best?  Celtic Pride. 
[00:35:00]  It was Colin Quinn.  But I think that got changed so much from what his original vision of it was.  Right.  That it's not even his movie now.  It's like, you know, it got switched.  A lot of it got changed, I think.  So originally, it was his project?  I believe it was.  But by the end of it, he didn't even recognize it?  Yeah, I think that's one of those cases.  So that's exactly what we've been talking about.  God damn, why do they do that?  Because executive producers get involved and they have the money.  But the executive producers, all those people are failed creative people.  A lot of them are, yeah.  Because if they were...  Why would you want to be behind the scenes if you're creative? 
[00:35:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  If you could be in front of a camera.  It's like that in every fucking industry.  Not to go on a tangent, but that's how radio is.  All these fucking idiots down the hall wanting to be...  Oh, sorry, Travis.  Yeah, definitely.  I see what I'm doing.  No, no, it's definitely...  It's right.  Oh, my God.  Right in front of your face, too.  I'm sorry, Travis.  But you probably could do a good radio show, though, to be honest with you.  What are you going to say?  He's right here.  I don't feel like an asshole.  Travis has natural abilities.  I'm not talking about...  Honestly, and I swear I'm not... 
[00:36:00]  I swear I'm not saying this.  It looks good on you.  I swear I'm not saying this because now I've got to save my ass.  But the guys that work for the show, I think all of them could do radio.  Even Roland with his stupid fucking...  You don't know what the fuck he's saying half the time.  But I'm talking about the...  He's shaking his head now.  Huh?  Roland's shaking his head now?  Roland's shaking his head now.  All you guys are really good on the radio.  All of you.  I would have been that to some of them are tolerable.  But a lot of guys that try to tell you what to do on radio...  See, you don't tell me what to do. 
[00:36:30]  That's the difference.  The guys that think they could tell me and Ann and Jimmy what to do with a radio show,  those guys are all failed radio show hosts.  But they love the business so much, they went into the boring end of it.  Exec producers are sometimes...  They're just the money guys.  A lot of them are sometimes bigger managers who have a lot of money built up.  There are some guys that just produce and do a good job and produce a lot of...  Oh, we got Penn Jillette coming in, by the way, on Monday, right?  Yeah, I can't wait.  I got his book.  I started it.  It's very good.  What's the book about?  It's called God Know. 
[00:37:00]  And, you know, it's his pen.  I just read the, I think, the first chapter of, you know, it's about him being an atheist or whatever.  That's what I'm getting of it so far.  But the opening is fucking great.  It's a take.  The first chapter is about...  It smells good, right?  It's very good food disorder.  Jesus, Roland.  It literally looks like a German shepherd just walked in the way, sniffing around the place.  He's sniffing everyone's balls.  But it's about the arrogance.  Oh, T.I.'s book? 
[00:37:30]  All right.  Oh, these are both books of people we have.  Great, great.  It's about how you think that atheists are really arrogant.  But he makes a great point in the opening chapter about how it's not atheists that are arrogant.  Atheists are humble because they're saying, I don't know.  I mean, I think some atheists are arrogant.  Right.  It's really fucking funny already.  And it's smart, dude.  I want to read some of that over the weekend.  I'm going to try to book the whole book if I can.  Hey, Travis from Neptune is pissed off.  Silverchair, third tier.  It came out in fucking 1994. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, 1994 was third tier fucking grunge band.  Yes.  The biggest one was already dead.  Right.  So, Travis, you just fucked yourself by saying that.  And then someone told me that Puddle of Mud did a version of Give Me Shelter by The Stones.  We have that in the system?  I'm finding it.  Hang on.  I don't think I've ever heard that fucking song.  And there's something else.  Oh, this guy wants to tell us a Puddle of Mud story.  Why are we talking about Puddle of Mud?  Brendan in Ohio.  Hey, morning, guys.  Welcome aboard, Brendan. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, I used to be a Puddle of Mud fan.  I went to see a show in Toledo where I'm from.  And he only played one and a half songs before he threw his guitar into the crowd and then started throwing beer bottles into the crowd and yelling gibberish at the crowd.  And there's a great picture you can find online of him in the backseat of the Toledo cop car, handcuffed and banging his head against the window and spitting down the window.  Did he have problems, this guy?  He was at the bar and before the show and before the show started, people were just buying him drinks and he did about 15 shots of Jaeger before going up on stage. 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  Yeah, he's not welcome back in Toledo, but I don't think anybody would want him now anyway.  Puddle of Mud's not too popular these days.  No, they kind of fell off, right?  Yeah.  All right, brother.  Thank you, Brendan.  Yep.  Let's hear Gimme Shelter, a little piece of that.  Fucking love this song.  The D's are backwards in mud.  That's no good.  You like this song by the Stones, even though this is Puddle of Mud's version? 
[00:39:30]  I do, yeah.  Fucking could be my favorite Stones song.  Not my favorite, but I do like it.  What's your favorite?  I don't know.  I guess.  Think about it.  Yeah.  Maybe paint it black.  Really?  Yeah.  This is relatively new.  This is off of an album that's not even out yet. 
[00:40:00]  Really?  Of all covers.  Turn this up.  Get some shelter.  Oh, yeah.  I'm gonna fail.  Won't you know it, yeah?  It's just a shot away.  It's just a shot away.  Won't you know it, yeah?  It's just a shot away.  It's just a shot away, yeah.  And again, might be Sympathy for the Devil, too. 
[00:40:30]  We've talked about this before.  To pick my top one, I might be Sympathy for the Devil.  As much as I've heard it earlier.  That's a good choice.  I was gonna play this to break, but I'm not feeling it.  It's cool, but...  Let me ask you, if any of you are Stones fans, just to tangent for a second.  Paint It Black, is it about, there's a line of that, is it about his girlfriend dying or something like that?  I think it's got something to do with a funeral.  He's depressed because he went to a funeral.  There was a somebody he loves died.  That's my impression of the song. 
[00:41:00]  I can't...  Again, I'm not that big, deep with the Stones.  Well, let's find out.  If anybody knows, I'm sure there's some Stones fan out there.  You like Dead Flowers by the Stones?  I don't know if I know that one.  Oh, God.  I think it goes like...  We're playing a Stones song to break.  Dead Flowers!  In my sill.  No.  I don't think I know Dead Flowers.  We might have to go Dead Flowers in a break.  I think that record's worth anything as a record.  We're looking at the Paint It Black picture.  Oh, Under My Thumb's a fucking good one, too, man. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, but those are all the poppy ones, man.  I like that, Under My Thumb.  No, I mean, I don't hate the poppy stone shit, but I'm more of a...  You know, I like to get a little trippy with them.  Gimme Shelter.  Gimme Shelter just reminds me of so many movies, because it's in so many...  It's like the scene when somebody's going into the drug haze of their life.  They'll play fucking clips of Gimme Shelter.  But you don't realize how many of these songs are used in films until you hear them,  and you're just like, oh, my God, I've heard that 50 times recently. 
[00:42:00]  How many movies use Gimme Shelter?  I don't know.  I've heard it a lot.  Vietnam movies use it, I think, a lot.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  It is a good...  Does anyone know the question to the...  The answer to that...  Paint It Black thing?  One of the listeners might know.  It was a group effort Jagger contributed to the lyrics seemingly about a man mourning his dead girlfriend.  More literally, it is about using the visual trick of painting everything black in the mind's eye.  Hey, why don't we have the queers on today?  Wow. 
[00:42:30]  The who?  Those aren't queers.  What?  Why don't we have the queers on today?  Why are they blowing us off?  Probably because you're calling them the queers.  Yeah, maybe because you're not saying the name of the show, you're saying the queers.  That's a good point by Sam.  Well, maybe I shouldn't say the show because we assume they may be a bit on the queer side.  Yes, Roland.  They're back in three weeks, so you want me to get them?  Sure, yeah, have them back in, assholes open.  Make sure they get married on our show.  We're going to marry a gay couple because we're edgy. 
[00:43:00]  Like Tiny Tim.  We don't even know if they're gay, but we've had our suspicions.  Yeah, I think they are.  I'm pretty sure.  With each other, though.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to thank Fezzy sitting in, man.  That's just a hell of a thing he's doing for us today, man.  A hell of a fucking thing.  Ant's out today and Fezzy stepped right the fuck up to the plate.  He's doing two goddamn shows today.  He doesn't do it.  Does he walk circles in the building?  He does.  He does.  Well, ask him. 
[00:43:30]  Because I saw Fez yesterday.  I don't see him.  He's nodding.  Yes.  He does circles outside, and then he does circles in the building.  I see him inside.  He's got a routine.  Outside, I'll see him sometimes when we're leaving.  But if I'm here a little later, I'll see him inside.  Right.  But then I saw him walking, and then I saw him a few minutes later walking.  I'm like, oh, is he walking?  Maybe he just does it to get himself ready for the show.  Mm-hmm.  Everyone has rituals.  I mean, we've had Ronnie B fill in.  And, you know, Fezzy's filling in today, and I really appreciate that.  If Ronnie B wants to stop in today, too, that would be great. 
[00:44:00]  We'd love to have Ronnie B.  Give him a call.  Wake him up.  Wake him up.  Hey, Fez.  Should we go to break?  Yeah, I'll finish my chicken, the medley.  You know what?  Oh, excuse me.  We were going to do a fucking best of today, so fuck it.  We're going to go off-roading today.  Yeah.  Dead Flowers.  I want it right now in the break.  That was quick.  Thank you.  Me and Jimmy today.  And Fezzy sitting there.  Well, when you're sitting there, in your silk-off poster chair, talking to some rich folk that you know. 
[00:44:30]  Well, I hope you won't see me in my ragged company.  Well, you know I could never be alone.  Take me down.  Take me down, little Suzy.  Take me down. 
[00:45:00]  I know you think you're the queen of the underground.  And you get...  And you can't...  And you can...  Send me dead flowers every morning.  Send me dead flowers by the mail.  I'll see you next time. 
[00:45:30]  I'll see you next time. 
[00:46:00]  I'll see you next time. 
[00:46:30]  Bye-bye. 
[00:47:00]  Take me down, let's see this, take me down. 
[00:47:30]  I know your fingers are playing on the underground.  I'll see you next time.  I'll see you next time.  I'll see you next time.  I'll see you next time.  And I won't forget to put roses on your brain. 
[00:48:00]  No, I won't forget to put roses on your brain.  I won't forget to put roses on your brain.  Here is XM, the virus.  For years, the Las Vegas Strip has played host to some of the world's best entertainers.  From the Rat Pack, Tom Jones, and Sid, Reed, and Roy.

[00:50:00]  I would be able to control the boner if this was more like expected to happen, but I didn't expect you'd be here in studio.  What an adorable little boner.  This is a lovely surprise that I am very thankful for.  Oh, I love surprises.  This is a lovely gift.  It feels like Christmas already.  Oh, you're Christmas all over my shirt.  I'm just trying to, look at her.  At the same time, I'm trying to control the boner here. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, it's so cute.  I'm trying to control the boner here.  Oh, pretend I'm your lover  I'm trying to control the boner here  Get your tweets excited  I'm trying to control the boner here  I'm gonna go over an lens  I'm trying to control the boner here 
[00:51:00]  Control the boner, bro  Control the boner  Control the boner, bro  Hey, this is Mike Wolfe from American Pickers, and you're listening to the Opie and Andy Show.  Anthony, do it again. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, fuck you.  Shut up.  She knows the word Anthony.  Yeah, no shit.  She's screaming it all night.  Hey, this is Mike Wolfe from American Pickers, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Do it again.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love black cock.  It's me and Jimmy today.  And Fezzy, of course.  Sorry, Fezzy.  Yes, hey, Fezzy.  Fezzy's sitting in today.  Thank you, Fez, for getting up early. 
[00:52:00]  People!  What were we talking about before the break?  Oh, yeah, Tiger.  I get beat up a lot about my comments about Tiger on Twitter, but this fucking guy's done.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  He's done for a while.  He's going to win a tournament or two, but he's done.  I don't know.  He's done.  I don't know why I like Tiger.  He's probably arrogant.  I guess because I met him once, and he was very nice.  Right.  One interaction I had with him years and years ago, he gave me an autograph, and he was pleasant. 
[00:52:30]  Well, the PGA Championship is going on.  Tiger started.  Is he winning?  Oh, my God.  Not only is he winning, he might not even make the cut.  I was trying to stand for a piece of paper.  After the first two days of the tournament, then they cut a bunch of golfers, Jimmy.  The ones that don't have a shot at winning the fucking thing.  And he has a good shot at being cut after today's round.  He started three under after five holes, was it, Travis?  Yeah.  And then... 
[00:53:00]  Three under's good, right?  That's fucking really good.  And then he shoots a 77.  Seven over par.  14 shots back.  He's in 132nd place.  Someone named good old Jerry Pate, I think it was.  Right?  Jerry Pate.  He's an old timer.  He's like 57 years old.  He also shot like a 77, so Tyra's just fucking...  Is he...  I wonder what he's...  I was telling Travis before the show, a guy like that that has a natural ability to swing  a fucking club, just get up to the ball and hit the fucking thing. 
[00:53:30]  I don't understand how he would change his entire swing.  Can you imagine what...  I don't understand how these guys change their entire swing and are able to be competitive  after that.  Don't forget his wife has a girlfriend, a guy, supposedly, she's been seeing.  That might fucking bug him.  You know, it's like we forget, yeah, he cheated a lot, but when you know that the fucking...  He was married to a 10.  Yeah.  And even though he probably didn't want to bang her anymore, when you know somebody else  is fucking your chick, the mother of your...  That's got to fuck you up, man. 
[00:54:00]  It's like no matter what you've done, we never cheat and then think, who cares if she  cheats?  Right.  Like a lot of guys have, I'm sure, killed their fucking wives for cheating after they had  cheated too.  Mm-hmm.  So maybe that's fucking him up, because he knows she's banging or he thinks she's banging  someone else.  I think you were onto something yesterday.  He needs all those things he was doing to just kind of clear his head and play golf properly.  Dude, this fucking invincibility...  All that addiction shit that you were discussing yesterday.  But all these people in the clubhouse that would look at him a certain way, it's almost  like they all know and they never knew before. 
[00:54:30]  It's got to be embarrassing.  You walk into a place where you were the king, and then you've been totally exposed.  That's humiliating.  Right.  You were never that guy.  Or just the fact that you know that they know the way you talk dirty.  Tiger was a tossable guy.  What?  Tossable.  I know what you're saying.  Tossable?  Yeah.  Oh, you mean like, ah, rub his head tight.  Yeah.  He was like such an innocent fucking, ah, it's Tiger.  Right, right, right.  He was almost like innocent. 
[00:55:00]  And he was never that guy.  All that was exposed.  That was all fake.  You imagine your dirty, I mean for us it's not as bad because we talk about this stuff  every day, but you imagine your private dirty text messages coming out in the newspaper  or fucking, ah, all the things, the way you would fuck on Ambien, all these weird, really,  he's a private dude.  Right.  It's like we, I, for me it's like who cares if they know what you say, big fucking, but  for him, that's a massive, massive invasion.  So.  So that's probably killing him.  Yeah, my, I picked Rory to win this whole fucking thing and I got, I got a weird sports 
[00:55:30]  curse.  Rory O'Malley?  Turn it off.  Right.  Rory McIlroy.  So I pick him and then he pretty much breaks his wrist yesterday.  Or it's a tendon problem, right?  Yeah.  He hit a ball off a root.  You never fucking do this in golf, Jimmy.  Let me tell you this.  I don't know what that means.  You don't know much about golf, but the one thing you never want to do is fucking take  a full swing if your ball is anywhere near one of these fucking roots.  Oh, a tree root.  Yeah.  And he did just that and he fucking cringed immediately. 
[00:56:00]  And then it looked like he was going to drop out and every swing he had, well, the,  the next five or six swings after that, he would almost, he would throw the club cause  it hurts so much.  And then all of a sudden he iced it and it kind of came back a little bit and he finished  around and he was even, I think for the day.  Yeah.  But, uh, he's, he's definitely injured and he was the guy I picked yesterday.  He full swung on a root.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's lucky he didn't break his fucking, uh, arm in half.  You just don't do that. 
[00:56:30]  He should have just kind of poked out.  I admire, golf's a very, I'm sure, difficult thing.  And I admire guys that are good at it.  I just, it just annoys me and I wish it didn't cause I would rather enjoy it than not enjoy  it.  It's always on TV.  Well, what's funny is when someone like me goes and plays golf, just a regular schmo,  we have to dress the part on a golf, on a public golf course.  It's like, really?  I need a collared shirt.  Really?  Why?  Why?  That's, I think it's because it's so exclusive golf. 
[00:57:00]  Like, this place that they wouldn't let Clinton play because they didn't want a secret service.  It's like, you fucking assholes.  These are shitty public horses.  Yeah, but I mean...  It's not some real nice country club.  The ones where people really can't get into, and I know it's a private club and they have  that right, but they just annoy me.  I've been denied because I didn't have a collared shirt and I had to go back to the car and  put one on.  I'm like, really?  You mean like a collar, stiff collar shirt or just like an eyes eye?  Just a shirt with a collar.  Or, on some of these public horses, and they're not that great, they will not let you on if 
[00:57:30]  you don't have a collared shirt on.  Has to be tucked in.  Yeah.  It's like, really?  I've been stopped on a fairway and told to tuck my shirt in.  On a public horse?  Oh, yeah.  See, that's where you should be really pissed off.  But you're right.  It is the only sport where you're forced to dress the part.  You can go play softball and they're not forcing you to wear baseball.  The uniform.  It's exactly.  It just stinks. 
[00:58:00]  Let me say hi to Marie in New York.  Marie's going to talk golf with us.  Marie.  Hey, guys.  You know golf?  Not really.  I was just calling to tell you guys that you guys need to help Tiger find a caddy that's  going to get him laid.  Like, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  You need to be Tiger's caddy so you can have him get laid again.  Yeah, but this guy was all in with Tiger's girl thing.  Yeah, but he was married.  So, it's like, eh, you know?  Tiger doesn't need help getting laid.  That's easy.  Tiger needs to stop feeling like he feels like he's walking naked on the course. 
[00:58:30]  He's completely exposed.  Everybody knows everything.  And his thing is he's worried about corporate sponsorships.  He should just go out and start fucking, but he wants those corporate sponsorships.  He should just be, we said it yesterday, Tiger the playboy, showing up at the golf course  with a fucking bimbo.  Who cares?  You've been exposed, so just fucking go with it now.  But then he's going to lose $100 million in endorsements.  That's what he's afraid of. 
[00:59:00]  He's going to lose all that if he doesn't win a tournament the next year.  He's practically lost all of his endorsements anyway.  Nike stayed with him, didn't they?  Yeah.  What's that watch company?  Tag.  Tag.  Tag.  Horror?  Yeah, they dropped him.  Did they?  Yeah, like last week.  He's ranked what in the world right now?  Oh, Marie.  Go pick a pie.  What, Marie?  What, Marie?  Sorry.  Oh, no.  I was just wanting to talk about Travis.  Oh, God.  What, Marie?  When she took his money, she took his ego, too.  Oh, go dust something.  What? 
[00:59:30]  When she took his money, she took his ego, too.  She did take a lot of his money, but, you know, and it's rare that I think the woman  deserves half, like, because she didn't play golf, but I think that as a married couple,  she was kind of doing the right thing from what I know, and he just really fucked up.  He fucked up badly.  She doesn't deserve half?  He's got two kids with her.  She doesn't deserve half.  That's a tough one, man.  Tiger has enough money where he could have gave her a nice settlement where she would 
[01:00:00]  never have to worry about money ever again.  The whole half thing drives me nuts.  It drives me nuts, too.  That's ridiculous.  Only because it was such a public way he got caught 100% cheating.  Like, and again, the kids, the thing, it's like, it's hard to argue in favor of him when  he fucked so many different chicks while they were married.  It's like, it's just humiliated.  But his kids are going to be taken care of for the rest of their lives. 
[01:00:30]  She's going to be taken care of for the rest of her life, and it didn't have to be half.  It's disgusting what happens to fucking guys in divorces.  Simple as that.  I agree.  I'll never change my stance on that.  It's ridiculous.  It is disgusting.  All right, Marie.  That was wonderful.  You really did a lot today.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, thanks.  No, you did.  Well, it's hard to hear.  Marie, it's actually hard to hear you.  You're cutting it out, but thank you.  What do you do in New York?  Where are you going?  What's up?  I'm going to work.  Where do you work?  I work for a non-profit, so basically I don't make any money. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, okay.  Well, that's smart.  All right, real quick.  If they don't allow collars, if they make you wear a collars shirt, they should make those  guys take off those dumbass wildmouth pants.  Those things are awful.  I agree.  Oh, Voss wears that shit.  Oh, that shit is so fucking tacky.  The whole thing is ridiculous.  It's stupid.  I just want to play golf in a comfortable t-shirt.  All right, touch it out, guys.  Thanks for everything.  For everything.  Wow.  All right. 
[01:01:30]  Thank you.  Let me say hi to Angelo in Tampa.  Angelo.  Hey, guys.  What are you doing?  Hey, man, Angelo.  Hey, back in the 90s, I wasn't much of a golfer at all.  My buddies were, and one friend convinced me to go out to a public course, so he called  for a tee time and all that good stuff, and I used his sister's clubs.  I didn't have clubs, so we're out there waiting for our time.  There's just a bunch of old people around, and there's no way in hell.  I'm sorry.  No 80-year-old person is going to go quicker than us two. 
[01:02:00]  So we're waiting, and they call him in.  He goes to get the cart, and he's there for like 10 minutes.  I walk in, and he's going off on the golf pro, and I'm like, what's going on?  He goes, they're not going to let you play.  And I'm like, why?  And the guy said verbatim, you appear to be an amateur, and you're going to slow down  play on the course.  Come back during the week.  And my buddy, knowing golf, said, you can't do that.  It's a public course.  We got a tee time.  And they did.  They basically said, you're not playing today.  And I just never felt more like a black guy in all my life. 
[01:02:30]  Why did they say you couldn't?  Because I appeared to be an amateur.  The way I was swinging the clubs, maybe they knew they were girls clubs.  I don't know.  It's not like I had a pink bag or anything.  But yeah, just by how I looked.  You know what?  I mean, not to get too inside, but that's the responsibility of the ranger.  You know, he would push everyone along and make sure you're not slowing anyone up.  Yeah.  I do hate the attitude of these golf courses.  I absolutely do.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, I think they're kind of, it gives a fuck what you look like on the course. 
[01:03:00]  Who cares?  My buddy's biggest thing was, you know, public courses are out there to promote the game,  to get new people started, to bring money into that.  And they did the opposite.  They're kicking people off because they're thinking as a public course that they can do  something.  Like, yeah, private courses, sure.  Right.  But as a public course, you know, you want everybody to come and spend money and get  involved.  And, you know, it just helps golf in general.  Right.  And this fucking asshole was just like, no, no, sorry.  Come back during the week. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Fair.  And I just let you guys.  Thank you, brother.  Not surprised at all.  All right, man.  Yeah, I don't, um, I don't like that, the attitude or the culture of it.  All right.  All right.  We got, we got, we got to help Rob in New York.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, sir.  Rob, are you, are you just trying to get on the radio?  Be honest.  Listen, this is a hot issue and you guys must care for me because you took me really  fast.  Of course.  But hold on.  Are you, are you just trying to get on the show or what you're about to say is real? 
[01:04:00]  No, listen, it's real.  I had to let this chick know yesterday what I found yesterday morning.  Okay.  I'm 34 going through a divorce.  This chick's 22.  So I'm game.  Let's go back to your place, do whatever.  The other night, midweek drinks on a Wednesday.  Oh, I'm a gentleman.  So I went down on her.  I took care of business.  Didn't expect anything in return.  That's what I like to do when I meet a new chick.  It sets me up for the next time.  So hold on. 
[01:04:30]  Do you jerk off on the way home?  No, I took care of that when I got home though.  All right.  But still, listen, I've seen enough of these text messages and nasty emails.  So the next morning, which was yesterday, when I hit her up with it again, the lights are  on, and I noticed something between her two holes.  It wasn't nasty, but they were there.  I know what the fuck they were.  There were three of them right next to each other.  On her, on her taint? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  Like right below her, uh, her pussy hole.  What were they?  They looked like warts.  Oh, okay.  Like little, I thought she had like shingles or psoriasis.  Oh my God.  What the fuck is that?  Are you sure it wasn't herp?  Hey, listen, man.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I looked at everything on the internet.  I Wikipedia'd.  I was on WebMD.  WebMD.  Don't, I, oh my God.  We tell you guys all the fucking time.  Don't do the WebMD thing. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Because you want to talk about a flow chart that leads to cancer or AIDS.  Go to WebMD.  Absolutely.  It's, it's more along the lines of a wart.  I got this information from what I looked at.  And then I was trying to tell her as responsible as I can.  Like, hey, don't feel funny.  But I think I found this this morning and didn't know what to say.  Right.  So she took it well.  I took the medical approach to it.  Like, you know, it could be a side effect of HPV if you have that.  You might be in line for cervical cancer. 
[01:06:00]  You know, get yourself checked out.  And then she tells me, yeah, well, she had like cancerous cells removed from something  years ago when she was a teenager.  And I'm like, well, fuck.  All right.  Well, check that out.  And now I'm wondering if, in fact, it was warts.  Maybe.  She may not even know she has on there.  That seemed like a tough place to check.  She didn't.  According to her, she didn't.  She was like really embarrassed.  You know?  Yeah.  I was talking to her like, look, it's OK.  You know, better I found it than somebody else that was going to ridicule you and cast 
[01:06:30]  you out.  You know, does she more mature?  But what's my risk now?  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  I could only be so cool about this.  Like, I was definitely there.  I took care of that area.  Good, my friend.  Does she does she take does she?  I don't know.  Take spin classes.  No, no.  She's a little.  She's not doing anything.  Are you saying it could be from the bike, the fucking bike seat, cramming her fucking  tank?  Right.  Maybe it might be.  Maybe a little too moist down there.  It works like a from spin class like a chin strap on her fucking asshole vagina. 
[01:07:00]  I don't know, man.  Chances are, like, if you're a guy, you'd be probably been exposed to it anyway.  I mean, let's be honest.  I mean, what guy hasn't been fucking exposed to warts?  We just don't know.  We got him.  I don't know.  I don't have anything.  I had a pretty good run of long term relationships and a few bangs in between.  I haven't gotten anything, nor have I ever seen anything.  This is the first time I saw it.  I know I was in that area twice before I realized it.  Well, I'm wondering what my exposure is, you know? 
[01:07:30]  Well, how fucking wasted were you that if you're taking care of the area, you didn't  notice a few speed bumps?  Oh, the night.  I didn't.  I didn't know the night before because it was it was kind of dark.  You know, you're just working by memory.  You're feeling yourself out a little bit.  The next morning, back by popular request, you wanted it again.  And now the lights are on.  I'm looking.  I'm like, hey, wait a minute.  Wow.  Did you try to pop them?  No, I didn't.  No, sir.  You know, I mean, they weren't nasty. 
[01:08:00]  It just looked like her skin, but it was a little fucked up.  I'm like, that shouldn't be there.  I know what that is.  Jimmy, what do you think?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  I don't know.  But whatever.  I wouldn't freak about that.  You know, herp or fucking, if you saw herpes sores or that's different.  But if you just see what could be a wart.  I mean, yeah, that's gross.  But you know how many chicks you probably fucked that had them and didn't know?  Do you know how many chicks you fucked that had?  I mean, you know, even a long term relationship.  A lot of times girls don't get checked for that.  No, unless you're getting your pelvic check or whatever they do, you know, with the inside scope or something. 
[01:08:30]  You could be riddled with these on the inside and not know.  I just happened to see it on the outside and they weren't runny.  It wasn't gross.  It wasn't like any of those emails you see from your buddies.  This was just like, oh, look what the fuck that is, you know?  Are you panicking?  No, I mean, you know, you got to fucking face the fire.  You know, I thought I did the right thing by telling her in a way where she wouldn't freak out.  But on the other hand, I want to know, like, is my fucking tongue going to fall out in five years? 
[01:09:00]  Do I have to worry about what I did?  Well, do they look like skin tags?  Yeah.  So maybe they're skin tags.  Nah, trust me.  What's her nationality?  Oof, I don't know.  She's Irish.  She looks Irish, French, Canadian.  Um, if she looks French, Canadian, that means she probably has a nice pussy.  I don't know why.  I always associate, like, French and Polish chicks and Native American chicks with having fucking fat voxes.  They got polished pussies.  Yeah, nice fat ones.  Fat. 
[01:09:30]  Like, no inner lips.  The juiciness on the outside covers it all.  You don't like to get to it.  What's worse than a fat pussy with no clit?  You ever have those big lips and a fucking no clit?  It's like, what are you doing?  I've had them all, but who are we to be picky?  You know what I mean?  Bob, believe me, I'll take it.  I'm not saying I've never actually objected, but it reminds me of, like, the chimp lady's face.  Like, you just see, like, this buck from fat cheeks and no nose.  It's just kind of creepy, even though she had a big nose.  All right, well.  All right, I don't know.  That's what I got going on. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know if I'm due to call Dr. Steve tonight whenever he's on.  I'm just kind of, I just want to know, like, how does one get it?  All right, fine.  Wake up, Dr. Stupid Steve.  Hold on a line, Rob.  We'll go back to you when we get Steve up.  Hold on, Sal.  Hey, thanks, guys.  That's Rob.  Yeah, all right.  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.  Let's say hi to Brian in Texas.  Brian.  Hey, he needs to just get some alcohol and scissors and cut that shit off.  That'd be cool.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Hey, let me ask you, dude. 
[01:10:30]  I have a little skin tag on my head that drives me nuts, and I got to get it off.  It's ugly, but I forget I have it.  It's not that noticeable.  I know, but it's fucking horrible, right?  It's right there.  I got to get rid of it.  You know what?  I had one on my throat, and I, seriously, dude, I cut it off with scissors.  It bled like a motherfucker.  I mean, you know, they're harmless.  I should just pull it off.  Yeah, I think my brother does all his own surgery.  You could do that one, Jimmy.  That's easy.  I want to get it removed, though.  I go to a skin doctor every fucking year, and the shit she does to me, I'm like, I could 
[01:11:00]  do that.  I should do that, too.  Will she pull it off a little?  They cool it off or something?  You just take a little fucking medical scissor or whatever and cut it off, and it bleeds  a little bit, and then you put a Band-Aid on it, and then if you do it yourself, it's  free.  If you go to a doctor, it's like 400 bucks.  200 bucks, probably, per skin tag.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, they're just gonna...  I think my brother uses, um, uh, uh, um, uh, what does he use?  I'm trying to think.  He uses, uh, clippers, like fucking toenail clippers. 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Try that, Jimmy.  Oh.  Toenail clippers.  Oh.  No.  You wouldn't do that?  Fuck no.  You'd get a nice cut.  Oof.  All right, man.  So you do your own surgery there, Brian.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, where I can, you know.  Yeah.  I'm not gonna pay somebody that much money to do something I can do myself.  Right, I hear you.  That's a can-do attitude.  There's a lot of guys out there that do their own surgery, I'm telling you.  We could do a whole hour on this.  I wish...  Old school.  If my brother Brett's up, the owner of FH Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village, 
[01:12:00]  uh, we're expanding.  We took over the upstairs.  We're, uh, we're fucking moving forward.  Oh, good.  Making the place bigger.  If he's up, please call, because this fucking kid, he's been in the restaurant business since  he was 12, 13 years old.  No, there's no health insurance in that business until you own something.  And that, that kid has fucking done his own surgery, man.  Impressive shit.  Can I get rid of my skin tag?  You wanna do it right now?  No, I don't.  Uh, Dr. Steve.  My y'all. 
[01:12:30]  Good morning.  Are you awake?  Yeah.  You've heard of guys that do their own surgery, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's fun.  What kind of...  What, before we go to Rob, who has a really good question for you, he's panicking.  What kind of, uh, surgery can we do to ourselves before it gets too dangerous?  We can pull, we can do the skin tag thing, right?  That, that's easy.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  But, uh, there was a guy there in, when I was a medical examiner, you know, I got that  really, uh, bizarre journal called the Journal of the National Association of Medical Examiners. 
[01:13:00]  And it's, uh, they love, these guys love to tell stories and put it into, you know, scientific  terms, so, but they're really just telling horror stories.  Sure.  And this, uh, one guy, uh, was having improper sexual thoughts.  And so he, he thought it was his adrenal glands that was causing it.  So, in his dorm room, he, uh, did, uh, an adrenolectomy on himself. 
[01:13:30]  Where are your adrenal glands?  Well, they're above your kidney.  Whoa.  This guy opened up his, um, his abdomen and, uh, apparently gave himself some kind of anesthesia,  but was able to perform the surgery.  Uh, got one of his adrenals out before, uh, uh, he had to stop because he had too much pain  when he had to retract his liver. 
[01:14:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  It's an absolutely true story.  And he ended up going to the hospital and he was in the hospital for a while, but he  survived, so.  What a dope.  What was his problem?  Was he, he wanted to suck dick or something?  No, he, yeah.  Pedophile?  He never, it, it never really said that, uh, in the, in the article.  But he, uh, uh, he did the, he did all this research about how to, uh, take out his  own adrenal gland and stuff, but it was bizarre. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, no, I know that, I knew that guy.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, see, he's all right.  He didn't know him.  Yeah, he's all right.  Well.  There's a, there's a term for that in psychiatry and I can't remember what it is, but.  All right, all right, uh, hold on, we got Rob.  So, Rob, we got Dr. Steve on the line now.  Dr. Steve, hello.  Dr. Steve's not a real doctor, he just plays one on the radio, we all know that, and,  uh, so tell Dr. Steve.  I make my own beer, too.  And makes his own wine.  Uh, so tell, uh, Dr. Steve what you got going on and maybe he could diagnose you without seeing 
[01:15:00]  you, you gotta remember that.  Let me sum it up for what happened.  Rob was in Los Angeles and Magic Johnson put a load in his hiney, he's not a problem.  Go.  Oh, fuck.  Well, it's not that bad.  No, I wasn't Magic Johnson, it's not age related and I, you know, there wasn't a  a dick in my ass this time, but no, listen, I was, I was going downtown on somebody the  other night and then the next morning, um, I realized that she had something between her 
[01:15:30]  on her taint that I believe to be two or three warts.  Okay.  That she didn't know about.  Well, uh, Dr. Steve, ask them what they look like and all that, I guess, right?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it looks like it looked, they looked healthy, as healthy as they could  be for being there.  They weren't oozing, they weren't weird or bumpy, they just looked like three little  flat, like, little triangles almost, like little pyramids.  Hmm. 
[01:16:00]  Hmm.  Okay.  Well, genital warts can look like a lot of different things.  They can look like little skin tags, they can be all fungating, where they just look like  a chunk of cauliflower cascading out of...  No, nothing, nothing like this.  It almost looks like...  Fungating.  Ugh.  You never want to hear that you've got something fungating.  Fungating.  Oh, God.  Fungating.  No.  Holy shit.  You never want anything that looks like cauliflower on you.  Oof.  There was no seepage or oozing or anything, you know? 
[01:16:30]  That's seepage.  Yeah.  Oh, no, nothing like that.  Okay, so three triangular things and it just looked like skin.  Yeah, it was the same color as everything else.  Like, if I had to look at it for a while, because I didn't know...  There's a lot going down there.  Maybe it was, like, another layer of skin or folds or whatever these chicks have going  on, but no, this was significantly lower than her opening.  So, it wasn't part of her vag.  It was definitely something that shouldn't be there that I was in close contact to before 
[01:17:00]  I noticed it and the night before.  So, I'm wondering what my exposure is and what's the risk.  Is something like this transmittable?  Yeah.  Now, here's the thing.  If they were warts, it is possible for you to transmit that from the genitalia to the  mouth.  It's called human papillomavirus that causes warts and it is certainly transmissible.  It's a sexually transmissible disease. 
[01:17:30]  Now, I'm not convinced that these things were warts, though.  It's not impossible that she could have had some kind of trauma there or even, you know,  vag zits at one point that caused scar tissue because, you know, this sounds a little bit  like it could have been scar tissue.  How well do you know her?  I mean, can...  I don't.  We're getting to be fast friends as we speak about it.  It was a responsible approach. 
[01:18:00]  I told her about it.  I'm sure she's happy that you're on a national radio show.  Actually, this show is heard around the world now.  Right.  I know.  Two countries.  Yes, I'm sure.  This is what you can do.  As long as this is somebody that you'll see again and you can talk to her about it,  she needs to go get checked out and see if those things are indeed warts.  If they are not, you're pretty much good to go, assuming that she doesn't have gonorrhea  or chlamydia or syphilis or any other thing that you could get. 
[01:18:30]  But if they are indeed warts, it's not impossible that you could have transmitted those yourself.  Now, the odds are not 100%.  Even if she has herpes, the odds that you'll transmit that to you are not 100%, even if she's  got a lesion, although it's really close if she's got a lesion.  He was licking them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know, but it's...  Yeah, I was all over there. 
[01:19:00]  I mean, so skin-to-skin transferring is possible regardless of the state of the wart?  Like, it doesn't have to be infectious or disgusting-looking for you to be able to get it yourself?  Well, that was what I was going to say.  The reason it's not 100% is because the virus is protecting itself by this sheath of wart that  it's created.  And a lot of times, the viruses aren't right there on the surface.  And if it's not one of these fungating cauliflower-type warts, it's less likely that you'll pick it up. 
[01:19:30]  Will you not say...  Steve, you can't say things like a sheath of wart.  Do you know how awful a sheath of wart is?  It sounds like an alternative band.  Sheath of wart is playing in Irving Plaza tonight.  Jimmy, when he says it to you, it sounds gross.  But for me, it actually sounds like this thing I saw could have been protecting me from what  she had. 
[01:20:00]  So I don't mind hearing a sheath of wart.  A sheath of wart.  You didn't get any of the juice on you, right?  It didn't pop or nothing.  No, no.  It was very healthy.  It looked like skin color.  Imagine if it pops and some of that juice hits your eye.  I mean, if there was...  I don't even know what to say, guys.  So I'm kind of half still fucking nervous because there is a chance.  Skin to skin contact.  That's how you spread...  How about you tell her that she owes you and that she's got to get checked out and then  give you a fucking phone call and tell you what it is? 
[01:20:30]  Right.  Well, no, she's already on that.  She was all freaked out yesterday.  She said she was going to the doctor today.  All right.  So this is what you've got to do, Rob.  You've got to fucking let us know on Monday what it is.  Oh, I can't wait to call you guys again.  All right.  Good.  Yeah, it might be a sheath of wart, but if it's fungating, it could be a problem.  You don't need it fungating because the virus is protecting itself, much like the virus  in this studio does when he can't tell a joke.  You know, it's a sheath of wart. 
[01:21:00]  There's no fucking punchline here.  Right.  Fungating.  Fungating.  Jesus.  All right.  Sounds like something black kids do with fungating.  It's got something to do with attacking white people by slamming them into a gate.  Boo.  I think it's planking.  Boo.  Some form of planking.  Fungating.  As I started that joke, I realized there was nothing humorous happening.  It happens.  I didn't help too much.  Steve, anything else for poor Rob, who's probably going to die in 10 years from me?  It's really common.  About 50% of people who are really sexually active have been exposed to human papilloma virus. 
[01:21:30]  I'm not.  You know what sucks?  I am not really sexually active.  I'm going through a divorce.  I filed my papers.  This is the first chick I've banged in six years.  And I didn't even bang her.  I just went down on her.  I hate you guys.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right, Rob.  Give us an update, Rob.  Everyone wants to know.  Take care, Sal.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  More importantly, we got guys calling up Steve that have done the surgery to themselves. 
[01:22:00]  This is a guy thing.  I don't think women do the self-  I've never heard of a woman doing it.  I know my brother, Brett.  He's got some great stories, but I don't think he's up yet.  But he's fucking done a lot of surgery on himself.  He once got a nail stuck in him from a nail gun, and he removed it himself.  Can you imagine?  He went over to my brother's house, and they did it together.  Nice.  And it was deep, deep in him.  I forgot where it was.  I think it was in his hand or something.  I remember that one, but he's done a whole bunch of these. 
[01:22:30]  If you're in Braveheart times, and you need to yank an arrow out of your shoulder, that's one thing.  Right.  We don't live on a desert island.  You could go to the doctor and have that done.  You know what I was thinking of recently?  It's funny you said Braveheart.  Like, those old days, Roman Empire, it's like, we forget there was no internal medicine.  Right.  Like, as much as my nose gets stuffed, and I'll use a neti pot, or I know I got surgery.  What the fuck did- even the Caesars couldn't get their stuffy noses fixed.  No.  They just suffered. 
[01:23:00]  You were supposed to die.  Yeah.  People lived to be 35.  Yeah.  You were supposed to die from all that shit.  We made it to 40-something.  Yeah.  Was 40s considered old back then?  Yeah.  In some cultures, it was.  Yeah.  And then once in a while, you'd make it to the 70s, but that was rare?  What really- yes.  That's right.  What really did it, though, wasn't so much modern medicine, was modern sanitation.  That's one of the things that really jumped our life.  Oh.  What do you- like what?  Like, because now we know more about germs? 
[01:23:30]  Well, yeah.  I mean, they cleaned up the water supply, and so we weren't getting cholera and all kinds  of waterborne illnesses, and then they cleaned up the food supply, so we weren't getting food-borne  illnesses, and then we just weren't shitting where we eat when we developed, you know, sewers  and stuff, you know, to get the shit away from the food and water supply.  All right, listen, I want to go to some of these home surgery guys.  Ryan in the Bronx.  Ryan.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, buddy. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, quick thing.  That dude- that chick might have an ingrown hair, too, man, because I had something like  that in my ball bag once.  It formed like a pimple, but it turned out to be like an ingrown hair, you know?  But anyway, in my case-  Yeah, absolutely right.  What's that, Doc?  I said absolutely right.  I- one time I woke up in the middle of the night, just probably I was like 19, and I fucking-  What's that, I broke a tooth years ago in the front, like on the bottom jawline, and  I woke up with like this crazy pressure in my head, and fucking my sheets were soaked  with sweat, I was bugging out, like I didn't know what to do. 
[01:24:30]  And I went to the bathroom, like fucking- for some reason when shit like that happens, I  go and stare at myself in the mirror like that, like I'm going to put myself in a fucking  trance to beat the pain or whatever.  And I fucking noticed that I had like a white bump on my- on my gum under the tooth that  was fucked.  So I was like, fuck this, man.  I went and got a razor blade, fucking flashed the bottom of my gum.  Oh, like, smallest cut, though, you know?  Like when I say flash, I didn't put a fucking, you know, an eight-inch cut, just like a-  that's like a centimeter. 
[01:25:00]  Dude, this shit drained out of my mouth.  I felt the fucking pain relief from the back of my head to the front of my fucking face.  And I was just like, wow, like that was probably the smartest thing I've ever fucking done  in my life.  When I told my dentist about it, the dude freaked out, you know?  But I could tell him, same shit Opie said, you know?  It's like, I go to you, you charge me $1,500 for that, you know?  I did the same thing.  You did- oh, shit.  You did not.  Yo, quick question.  You guys ever hear anything about that dude that said he killed his wife or no? 
[01:25:30]  No, I never heard a word.  Well, I heard he killed her.  You did?  Oh, yeah?  Yep.  All right, punch it out, boys.  All right, man.  It's funny.  All right, take care.  Yeah, Jimmy was gone.  I didn't even tell you he killed her.  Oh, cool.  Dr. Steve.  We got Danny or Sam working the computer today.  What?  Sam wore temp to, but he won't do it well.  I'll do it all right.  Just Google fungating genital wart.  Why?  Google fungating genital wart.  All right, hold on.  I want to go to a woman that does this surgery.  Who is this bitch?  This is what the health system has fucking done to us, man. 
[01:26:00]  We will do some of these procedures ourselves now.  Melissa, go ahead.  Hi.  When you go to the emergency room, they need about $3,000, like total bills.  So I started on the heroin addict, so you get a lot of abscesses.  So I've gotten pretty good at lancing them myself, cutting them open.  How do you do that?  With razor blades?  A razor.  Sometimes I'll just make a couple of series of holes using a syringe, a clean syringe,  and then you just kind of lean on it and push it out. 
[01:26:30]  I'm better than the doctors.  You're a heroin addict?  That sucks.  Are you trying to get better?  No.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, okay.  Why aren't you trying to get better?  I don't, you know, it just, it doesn't work out.  You know, I try, but I think it's, you know, I'm one of those addicts I use more to,  I'm definitely self-medicating at this point, you know, not really feeling the high, but.  What did you want to, what did you want to be when you were growing up?  I didn't think I'd live past 27, so, you know, everything else I guess is gravy or crap. 
[01:27:00]  I don't know.  Do you have a job?  No, I don't.  How do you get your money?  How much you're spending on heroin every day?  Yeah, how much you're spending on it, right?  Almost 100 a day.  Where are you getting the money?  I'm on disability.  I'm one of those people.  Oh, wow.  You know, if you wanted, you know, you got to want to, but if you wanted to get out of that cycle. 
[01:27:30]  What are you doing?  I don't know.  Speaking of doctors, he has to.  Yeah, but we don't have to save all the fucking baby turtles.  Let her go.  You don't have to.  I mean.  She's cool.  You can tell.  This is what she wants.  I mean, there are maintenance programs that you can get into where you're actually still  getting medication like Suboxone or Methadone, and you just don't have to be, you know,  popping abscesses on yourself.  Why did you become a heroin addict?  Like, what was the thing that happened to you if you had a point to it? 
[01:28:00]  Nothing really happened.  I mean, I wish I had been molested or I had a good reason to.  I mean, great childhood, everything.  I have pictures that I drew when I was in grammar school of syringes going into trees  that were made up of veins.  I showed psychiatrists and asked them, you know, why would a, you know, fourth, fifth,  sixth grader draw these pictures?  So, I don't know.  Destiny?  Who knows?  And Steve, we found what you were looking for, by the way.  The fungating.  Yeah.  But hold on.  I don't want to describe it.  Sam, I need Sam on the radio to describe. 
[01:28:30]  Why?  What happened?  I want you to describe that one right there.  Is it bothering Sam?  He can't look at it, but I want him to describe it for the radio.  Which one?  Point to the one.  This one right there.  Oh, my God.  Sam, what is that?  Yeah, describe it.  It looks like, oh.  Talk into the mic and describe it for the radio.  There's a page of fungating genital wards.  I could describe it, but then you can't use my description.  No, I want Sam to do it because he won't be happy.  All right, and then can I describe it afterwards?  All right, go ahead, Sam.  You go first.  Oh, it's like, well, it's a penis. 
[01:29:00]  And what is it around it?  There's warts surrounding the head right under it.  Yeah.  That's disgusting.  What about that one?  Well, the one you pointed to, Jimmy, it looks like he dipped his penis in chopped meat.  Yeah.  Ugh.  This one up here is pretty bad, too.  Which one?  Point to it.  I don't know.  Look at the top.  Oh.  The top left, though.  It looks like, you see, that's where the hole of the penis is.  You got to look to him.  Oh, my God.  That's the hole? 
[01:29:30]  Can you describe that one?  There's huge amounts of warts just protruding off of it.  It's like cauliflower.  Yeah, that's cauliflower.  He's a small dick, too.  Literally, the warts are almost as wide as his cock.  He must have been a hell of a boxer.  Oh.  Yeah.  His dick is a wrestler.  If you go about halfway down, there's a vagina that just has warts cascading out of it.  Oh.  Cascading.  Gross.  I guess this one.  Jimmy, I love how jaded we've gotten that we have a heroin addict on the line and we don't 
[01:30:00]  even care.  Well, we, but she doesn't want, you know, if she wants to get, she knows what to do if  she wants to stop, I think, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry?  You know what to do if you want to stop.  Yeah, she doesn't want to.  Oh, yeah.  I've been in sleep.  I mean, I know how you guys feel about people with psychiatric issues, but I think that's  definitely what the heroin's for.  If I don't use my depression level and the fetal position, I mean, that happens a lot  faster if I don't use.  Can I tell you, I don't have any tolerance for people with emotional issues, but that's  because it's all-encompassing in my fucking life. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  And I've had it.  And it's not fair for me to say that, but I can't take it anymore.  You know, hold on, we have, I also have a lot of empathy for people who have mental  illness and stuff.  My issue is not that they're sick, it's the self-centeredness of it that doesn't get addressed  is the only thing that bugs me.  I just hate how it affects your life.  Right.  It's fucking frustrating.  It's like when you're at the, when you're staring at the abyss or in the abyss, it's not  that you're self-centered, it's just that you don't, you can't even fathom how it affects 
[01:31:00]  other people.  That's part of it, yeah.  Do you at least listen to cool music when you're on heroin?  Absolutely, absolutely.  That's part of the enjoyment of it.  You know, I put on the buzzcocks, I put on, you know, old punk, I put on, I listen to  everything.  The buzzcocks, it sounds like bees are on a cock.  Exactly, shit.  Horrible.  So, so you're on disability and you're using all your money to get heroin, right?  Basically, yeah.  So you probably live in a shithole. 
[01:31:30]  No, I live in a house I grew up in.  You live with your parents?  I live with, my husband just passed away, so.  What did he pass away of?  What do you think?  Oh, drugs.  OD'd?  Or AIDS?  No, no, he didn't, he didn't OD'd, but drugs killed him just because he didn't take care  of himself the way he should have.  Nice.  Nice.  I know, I'm such a happy, you know, I didn't mean to be the downer of the morning.  No, it's all, it's fine.  Fine.  He didn't hurt my heart on.  Alright, Melissa, try to, I don't know. 
[01:32:00]  Good luck, Melissa.  What do you say to Melissa?  Good luck, I mean, you know, I hope you get better.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hope I get a gun and put a bullet in my head, but that's okay.  But if you want, you see, if you're not, I know how it is to be that depressed, but  you've got to want to do something about it.  I mean, you can't just keep languishing in it because it's comfortable.  It's just, you know, like I said, I mean, you know, my husband suffered from depression  too, but there were things he wanted, like he wanted to go to Ireland, he wanted to travel.  Like, I honestly, there's nothing I want to do or see, so it's like when people say get 
[01:32:30]  better, it's like, but why?  It's not going to, it's not going to make the world any brighter a place for me.  It's just going to be, I'm miserable, but dealing with it head on.  Oh, I don't know if that's true, though, because the symptom that you're talking about is a symptom  called anhedonia, which is just a lack of taking pleasure and stuff, or apathy, and those  are both symptoms of depression.  And those symptoms will go away if you get your depression treated.  And the one thing is, is using something that depresses your central nervous system won't 
[01:33:00]  really treat your depression, it just kind of masks it, you know?  Can I have a question, Dr. Steve?  I mean, I've been on every psychotropic medication known to man in high doses, and they never had  any impact on me.  Is that because of the heroin?  But I know other heroin addicts who are on the, you know, the Zoloft and the Prozac,  et cetera, and they feel it.  It does, like my brain, the only drug I ever had an effect from was Abilify, and I went 
[01:33:30]  totally psychotic on the antipsychotic.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, do they counterintuitive, or?  I mean, yes, they can have what are called paradoxical effects, where, you know, if you  give somebody Ativan, it's supposed to calm them down, it makes them crazy.  So, you know, that's why there's so many different drugs, because, you know, one isn't going to  work for everybody.  But, you know, there's some new antidepressants out there, definitely talk therapies on the  list of things to do. 
[01:34:00]  And then just getting out of the cycle of going to the streets to get your medication  can make a big difference.  You know, if you're getting it from either a methadone clinic or your regular doctor,  in the case of Suboxone, and it's a lot cheaper, it would be like getting a raise, because you  wouldn't be spending $100 a day, you know, and that might brighten your outlook a little  bit.  But, you know, there is help out there, but like Jimmy said, you kind of got to want it.  But you got to be aware that it actually would help you, you know, but it may take two or 
[01:34:30]  three or even 20 tries.  And how old are you, Melissa?  Um, 40.  Yeah, it's too late.  Oh, not too late.  You know, you can't go through life like that, just waiting to die.  That kind of stinks to it, right?  Yeah, I would agree, Jimmy.  You got to.  So why don't you do something? 
[01:35:00]  Like what, Jimmy?  What is there to do?  Like make an effort into getting better.  Like, first of all, why don't you address the heroin?  That's that number one thing when you're not doing well.  Get rid of the heroin addiction.  Start there.  Yeah.  Like maybe go to a detox or a rehab and then fucking, you know, try to start from there.  But recovering from heroin is that you can't understate how much that would help depression  stop shooting heroin or whatever you're doing.  No, yeah, shooting.  Um, I guess.  I mean, but I've been depressed in some level.  I mean, literally, swear to God, since I'm six years old. 
[01:35:30]  Like, this has been an, you know, it's just as I've gotten older, it's gotten progressively  worse.  It's just, but I understand that.  And I know that's a real thing and it's not just the drugs, but the drugs are the elephant  in the room.  You got to fucking do something about that.  And then you can worry about the other stuff.  But if you're 40 and you've been like this since you were six, well, in 34 years, medications  have come a long way.  And the fact that you're doing heroin, no, you're not going to test any medications, real  effects if you're fucking doing dope. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  It's a good place to start, right?  Yeah.  If you're trying to get yourself back together, get rid of the heroin addiction.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just that whatever, whatever I've done to my serotonin and my dopamine, the  heroin works.  Like, you know, I was on, you know, like 300 milligrams of, you know, either Zoloft or  one of those.  They had given, you know, I had to take like six different pills because they only come  in a certain milligram amount.  And it did nothing.  Like, I wish I had negative side effects.  I just had no side effects.  It was taking a placebo, basically. 
[01:36:30]  It was, you know, I'd be in the psych's office and when the nurse would leave, I'd be the  other patients like, does this work on anybody?  And they'd be like, oh yeah, I couldn't leave my house.  Now I'm great.  And I'm like, oh man, I'm the only one, the only person in the world that these medications  have no side, no effects on.  How long have you been doing heroin?  Um, 10 years.  All right.  Well, maybe that's a big part of it.  I mean, I imagine you were drinking a lot before then, right?  I didn't drink at all.  I hate alcohol.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You just started with heroin? 
[01:37:00]  I started with cocaine.  How long were you doing that?  Uh, when was I doing that?  How long?  How long?  How long?  Probably like five years, five or six years.  All right.  So since you were 25, the last 15 years you've been just addicted, right?  Uh, yeah, basically.  You know, the coke I just stopped one day just, and then I started jogging like six miles a  day.  And then I found heroin.  You know what?  I think, um, I think you should do the commercial for Sirius XM. 
[01:37:30]  A heroin addict is able to get a fucking subscription to our show.  Holy shit.  And enjoy it.  And enjoy it.  Yeah, it's great.  It's so great.  I, when I, when I go to cops, that's when I listen to O.P. and Anthony.  Jesus.  All right, Melissa.  I don't know what to say to you.  Good luck, Melissa.  But you know, really, there's another way.  Even if, I'm not saying life's going to be great, but it's going to be a lot better  than what you're doing now.  Yeah.  You're gone?  Hello?  She's probably got disconnected.  She didn't seem like she would hang up. 
[01:38:00]  Wow.  I think she just shot herself.  It would have been louder.  Dr. Steve.  Bye, Melissa.  Are you depressed now?  I am depressed.  Oh, well.  I know someone's got some dope if you need it.  Wow.  You know, just the, well, she's off the phone and, but, you know, just that cycle of going  to the street and spending a hundred bucks a day and popping your own abscesses and stuff  there, I mean, there is another way to do this and she could still be on narcotics, you 
[01:38:30]  know, for a while while they were waiting on her off.  So there is, you know, like Jimmy said, you got to really want to do it and she doesn't  want to.  All right.  Bobby, North Carolina.  Bobby.  Hey, what's up, Opie?  I, before you took that depressing fucking phone call, the second she heard her voice,  you prejudging ass, you just went, oh, I've never fucking laughed so hard.  I just, I just have like, uh, I don't know.  I have this gift. 
[01:39:00]  I can hear the voice and I just know what I'm going to get.  It could have been a fan and you're just like, who the fuck are you?  Sorry, Bobby.  I'm an asshole.  My voice bugged you?  Yeah.  I like Melissa.  So I hope she, uh, I don't know.  Yeah.  Me too.  Uh, let me, uh, you want to do more, more, uh, self surgeries?  Yeah.  Let's go to Ben in California.  Ben.  Hey, Opie.  How are you today, man?  Pretty good, brother.  We got, uh, me and Jimmy today and called out sick and, uh, Fezzy sitting in, which was 
[01:39:30]  very nice of him today.  You know, I heard that Fezzy was in today.  I'm sure I'm glad to hear him, uh, doing two shows.  Fucking two show Fezzy, man.  It's, you know, that's his new nickname.  Two show Fezzy rules.  All right.  What do you got?  Uh, I pulled the tooth out, uh, just yesterday, man.  Driving down the road.  It was just killing me.  And I, I couldn't stand the pain anymore.  So I just, I ripped the fucking thing out.  With your fingers?  No, man.  I'd use a pair of small vice grips.  Jesus.  Well, hey, man, short-term pain over long-term pain. 
[01:40:00]  You know, I, I can deal with that.  You know, uh, when I was in the Marine Corps, I used to get, uh, uh, you know, like ingrown  toenails.  Yeah.  They could, uh, do the same thing.  You use your knife and kind of dig them out and just rip them off, man.  Oh, I think I have a, one of my brothers, I think took, uh, took off his own toe, uh,  nail as well.  Yeah.  This self-surgery thing happens all the time because you know what it's going to cost if you  go to a doctor or the emergency room.  Well, it's, it's the whole, like I said, I look at it as I can deal with pain short 
[01:40:30]  amount of time.  Right.  Right.  If you take care of it and just get it to fuck over with, then you're good.  But who wants to sit around with agony with a toothache and, ah, shit, man.  Pull that fucking thing out and deal with it later.  Right on, brother.  Reminds me of a little movie I saw called, uh.  Yeah, thanks.  What was that movie with Tom Hanks who was stranded on the island?  Castaway.  Castaway.  Where he had to pull his own tooth.  By the way, we're looking at footage, Grayson Chance is live at Fox. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, how old is he?  He's young.  Ellen DeGeneres is like, he's very good.  Oh, that's the kid that Ellen, uh, discovered?  It doesn't seem like there's a Justin.  On Ellen's, uh, record label?  Yes.  It doesn't seem like there's a Justin Bieber vibe outside the building, is there?  No.  No, no, no, no.  He's not at that level, even close.  You want a picture with him?  No.  No.  I mean, if he was there, I would, sure.  But he might be famous someday.  He's on Fox News, so I'm assuming Eric is working on him for the after show.  That's the Loverboy gig.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, let me say hi to John in West Virginia.  John.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man. 
[01:41:30]  Well, I had this friend who told me he had these big, large bumps on his bean bag.  Ooh.  And I told him, I'm not a doctor, you know?  So they were about the size of the blueberries, you know, the stand-alone fruit.  So I seen this motherfucker do some home surgery on him.  You can tell that.  Yeah.  Oh, go on.  All right.  He lanced one of those bad boys, and it splattered against the fucking mirror, and the smell  was unbearable.  I think they were, like, sis, but they could have been some kind of STD. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know.  I'm not a doctor, but, you know.  But the thing splattered after he lanced it?  Yeah, he lanced it.  He lanced it.  Nice.  He, yeah, he just stuck a fucking needle down in it and just, I mean, squeezed it, and it  just went all over the mirror, like, spread wide.  And, I mean, the smell was fucking unbearable.  What do you think?  I want to hear some chip action.  I want to hear some chip on that.  I got nothing to say.  I mean, what are you going to do?  He's lancing a boil.  You know what his name was?  What's he say, Lance-a-lot or something? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, his name was Lance.  Steve, what do you think that was?  No, I just don't.  Yeah.  What do you think, Doc?  He had some plugged sebaceous glands that got infected, is what it sounds like.  And those were little abscesses.  So, yeah, that can happen.  Yeah, sebaceous, right?  Sebaceous Bach or something.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Heather in Brooklyn.  Heather?  Hey!  It's Heather.  Well, that's Heather Hyde.  I recognize the voice.  What's up, Heather?  I never got to go to the doctor when I was a kid.  My dad, I think my dad had some kind of, like, manic depression that went undiagnosed. 
[01:43:00]  And he moved us out to the middle of nowhere.  And so if I got sick, I had to just kind of suffer through it.  Mm-hmm.  And I remember having, like, really high fevers and just being, like, you know, like, out of my mind as a kid.  And he would just go to work and leave me there.  And I guess if I didn't die, I was okay, you know?  My mother was sick.  And there was a doctor who would come over.  He was a black doctor. 
[01:43:30]  And he would always lay her on the floor and do, like, all kinds of, like, leg and chest tests on her or something.  Well, you're lucky to have that kind of health care, Chip.  Yeah, there'd be, like, two of them in there, the doctor and the doctor's helper.  And she would say, Chip, go outside now.  The doctors are going to help mother.  And they'd make all kinds of noise on the floor and, like, leave water on the floorboards.  They did home visits.  What's that?  They did home visits.  Jesus.  Yeah, they was checking.  The guy didn't look like a doctor, though.  He looked like the guy that was cutting the grass the week before. 
[01:44:00]  His underarms smelled.  Heather, you could have died.  I know.  I probably have some kind of heart condition or something from having strep throat without any kind of antibiotics or anything.  He was, like, weird socially.  Not, like, when a...  He'd get angry when the phone rang and stuff.  Why?  Well, yeah.  What was he doing?  Did he yell at it?  Like, quit ringing or something?  Why did he get angry at the phone rings? 
[01:44:30]  He would be...  Who the hell is calling?  He would literally, like, yell every time the phone rang.  And I was, like, a teenager, so...  Where is he now?  He lives in the mountains in Pennsylvania.  He's a redneck.  Oh, you don't really talk to him anymore?  No, he's the only living of three kids.  And both his brother and sister died from drugs, so...  Oh, nice.  Is he doing drugs?  No.  Actually, he's only an alcoholic.  So, he's, like, the white sheep of the family.  Oh, wow. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  Well, thanks, Heather.  All right.  Oh, sure.  You're welcome.  We got a guy that...  TMI!  Avi, is it?  Or Avi, or what the fuck?  Avi?  It's Avi, yeah, from New Jersey.  Oh, hi.  I watch a lot of things in your format.  Fuck, I don't...  Wow.  Don't ever want to laugh at Chip.  Fuck.  Avi, what do you got, bro?  Uh, yeah, I had, like, a rotten tooth in the back of my mouth, and there was just pieces  of it falling off. 
[01:45:30]  And then one day, I pulled out this, like, stringy rubber band from it, and I went to  the dentist to get the rest of it taken out, and I told him about it, he said I pulled  the nerve right out of the tooth.  Oh, my God.  You must have had lovely breath.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was wonderful.  Well, it won't hurt anymore after that.  But is it possible to pull your own nerve out?  Yeah.  How is it possible?  The pain...  Well, the nerve...  Well, look, by the time you can yank it out like that, that nerve is...  It's gone already?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The tooth was dead. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  The tooth was dead.  Yeah.  All right, punch it out.  All right.  There you go.  He pulled his own nerve out there, Dr. Steve.  There you go.  Sometimes when I was young and I was running around the house banging spoons or something,  my mother would say, get off them, Chip.  And I'd say, what?  She'd say, my nerves, you're on them.  Yeah.  That's how she would tell me to stop running around making noise.  Let's go to Todd in South Carolina.  Todd!  I've been a listener since y'all did that assault on the media, man.  Love the show, dude.  Thanks, Todd. 
[01:46:30]  Thanks, Todd.  About a month ago, I went to the doctor.  I had like a golf ball-sized lump on the side of my throat.  Basically, what you told me was it was a blocked salivary gland.  Basically, it was like kidney stones in my salivary gland.  It'd be about $2,000 to get her taken out, outpaging surgery.  I couldn't afford to take the day off and fuck paying $2,000.  I started squeezing on that motherfucker, and three, like, little things just popped out from underneath my tongue. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  I was working on that sucker, and I could feel like it felt like a half a quart of fluid came out behind it.  Instant relief.  Never had to slow up again, and it was the best feeling in the world.  Fuck that $2,000.  I mean, it was great.  I hurt like a motherfucker, but it was great.  See, I'm telling you, this happens all the fucking time.  And I'm sure there's a few people out there that fucked themselves up bad by trying to do this shit.  Hey, Steve, what were some of the other, like, back in the days before this, that they would have to fix on themselves, 
[01:47:30]  that, like, now we couldn't dream of fixing on ourselves?  Well, you know, if you got trauma to your leg, someone would just have to swallow it off with no anesthesia.  And the trick with the doctors, especially in the Civil War, if you got a wound that was, quote, unquote, mortifying, then it would – did you hang up on me?  No, no, we're right here.  Okay, I'll just make sure.  Sorry.  Now I have to decide taking that. 
[01:48:00]  But if you had a wound that was mortifying, the best doctor was the doctor who could take your leg off in under 14 seconds.  And it wasn't just the sawing of the leg off that was so horrific, because then it was bleeding.  So what do you do to stop the bleeding?  Don't.  You take a red-hot poker, and you jab it onto the stump to burn it.  To cauterize it.  Oh, my God.  How would they get it off in 14 seconds?  Yeah, just, you know, really good sawing technique. 
[01:48:30]  Couldn't anyone be a doctor back then, if that's all you had to do?  Well, you know, the original doctors were barbers.  Yeah, but really?  Yeah, that's where the – I mean, there were the sort of Hippocratic-type doctors that did symptom management.  But if you were in a little town in England or something, you would go to the barber to get stuff done, and they could bleed you.  Jesus.  And, you know, that's where the barber pole comes from, is that red and white, because they would take gauze to sop up all the blood. 
[01:49:00]  And then they would hang those strips out on a pole outside their establishment to dry, so that they could reuse them.  Jesus.  So the red and white, you know, the wind would whip the things around the pole.  And double vasectomy Todd, who's on our show, is a barber, and he told me that story.  Oh, wow.  You think it was possible back then that you would get a haircut and your leg removed at the same time?  I think so. 
[01:49:30]  Take a little off the top and bottom.  Right.  So, wait, they would saw through your leg in 14 seconds.  Would you pass out from that, you think?  Some people did, but their accounts that, you know, people gave of, this is what happened when they sawed my leg off,  and they said that they never completely lost consciousness, and they would curse themselves for that because they didn't get the blessed relief of fainting.  And then right after, as you were bleeding out, would just fucking take the hot poker? 
[01:50:00]  Yep, yep.  You'd put a tourniquet around it to try to slow the bleeding down and then take a hot poker to it and just cauterize the crap out of it to get it to quit bleeding.  And then if it didn't get infected, which was real likely, you might survive.  And, of course, back then they didn't have good prosthetics.  You know, you had wood that was about the only thing that you could carve out to do something, so you're walking around on this wooden leg.  And so those guys were getting wounds to their stump, and, you know, they didn't live a normal lifespan by any means. 
[01:50:30]  So the fucking, like, especially if it was on the upper part of the leg, that's got to be awful.  Oh, yeah, it's awful now, even with rubber and stuff and molding it around the stump.  I've got a friend who's got a prosthetic leg, and he's miserable.  Why?  He's getting infected?  Yeah, you just get, you can't make, I mean, a really good prosthetics person can do amazing things, but you, it's just not the same as your God-given leg, 
[01:51:00]  and you're going to end up with some, you know, neuropathic pain, that's pain from compressed nerves.  You're going to end up with some wounds, and, you know, my friend, his good leg is the one that went bad,  because he had to put so much pressure on it walking that he ended up getting his ankle fused.  What about stem cells?  Is that going to fix a lot of that, Steve?  Say that again?  Stem cells going to fix a lot of that?  Yeah, you know, what we need to be able to do is figure out how salamanders regenerate their limbs. 
[01:51:30]  If you rip a salamander's arm off, it just regrows it, and it's like, why can't we do that?  In how long?  A day?  No, no, no, no, it'll take weeks, but, I mean, it's a day.  I've seen it in a day.  Choice of regrowing my limb after they cut it off, or, you know, but it taking six months,  or having to wear a prosthetic the rest of my life, I'll wait the six months.  Yeah, I think the trick is that you have to live in, like, a little terrarium. 
[01:52:00]  And you have to eat flies.  Imagine if that was the fucking cost.  Let's go to Wade in Louisiana.  Wade.  Hey, boys.  Hey, we're on with Dr. Steve.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  Yeah, one time I was working on my house in New Orleans and busting up concrete, and I  kind of bent down, and what I didn't see was, like, the concrete had a, somebody must have  thrown a Coke bottle in there.  It broke up.  And, I mean, when I bent down, I just felt a little snap. 
[01:52:30]  And I looked down, and it had opened up my calf, the skin on my calf, like an old coin  purse, you know?  So, I mean, it was like lips down there.  And it was a weekend, and I said, that's 500 bucks at the emergency room.  So, I looked around, and I thought I'd had a suture, you know, and I just couldn't find it.  So, what I did was, I took a, not old, took a carpet needle and nylon thread, and I sewed  that bugger up in my bathtub.  And I'm going to tell you what, you should have seen the blood. 
[01:53:00]  And I'll tell you this, your skin, it's a lot tougher than people think coming up from  the inside.  And I put four stitches in it.  But, you know, I poured, you know, alcohol all over it and everything like that.  It healed up fine.  Did it hurt a lot while you were fucking pouring alcohol on it?  Oh, God.  Jesus.  It was like watching a movie.  It was like watching Rambo.  It was, it was.  We've all had stitches.  When you go to the emergency room, they give you that needle to numb it up before they  sew it up, and then you watch them sew it up, and it looks so fucked up.  Yeah.  You did that without them, without anything numbing you. 
[01:53:30]  Holy fuck.  Yeah, when they stick the needle in, it just gives you just a bare taste of what it would  feel like if we're doing it without the anesthesia.  So, yeah.  Do you think the way we look at medicine like now, like you look back at like the Civil War  type doctors, and we can't comprehend it.  In 50 years, they're going to look back at the way we live now and think the same thing.  Like, what do you mean you guys, when you got burned, your skin didn't come back?  Or like, how did that, how did you live without a limb?  Like, what the fuck?  When you got cancer, you gave people poison. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You died from cancer?  Looked back on as a very barbaric phase.  But, I mean, it's a necessary phase.  And we have, you know, better survival than we ever did.  But it's still a phase that we're going through that will be cast away when they figure out  how to make the immune system kill cancer itself.  Yeah, I guess eventually.  But then it'll be something else, right?  Natural, doesn't nature have to have something that fucking wipes us out?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Until Ray Kurzweil's singularity happens and we all upload our consciousness into machines, 
[01:54:30]  won't that be fun?  Do you think he's right?  I think he's right.  He's a smart guy.  I mean, I just think his time frame is off.  He's a bore as far as describing all that shit.  But I think just, look, if you could upload your consciousness to a machine and never have  emotions and never, you know, feel a tit again, is that worth living forever?  I don't know if it is.  But would you be downloaded into another body? 
[01:55:00]  I mean, I think he means you'd be downloaded.  Well, that's not what he's talking about.  Right now, he's just talking about your consciousness just sort of going to live inside a computer  box, you know, and down the road, surely we'll be able to make, you know, if we advance enough  with an infinite amount of time that we could develop some sort of body that we could walk  around with.  But also, like, feeling a tit and all that stuff is all mental anyway.  It's like, what a tit is or a knee.  So if you're in a computer, like, look what computer simulations can do. 
[01:55:30]  You could think you're in the space shuttle.  So I think we could probably fucking mimic all that stuff, tits and all that shit, and  you could probably live happily.  Yeah, so like living in the matrix.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve, do you like tits?  Love them.  All right, we got the carpet needle guy.  That could be the best one so far.  Let's take a couple more.  Thank you, Wade in Louisiana.  Okay.  What are you waiting for, a bus?  I can't go out of the wooden legs. 
[01:56:00]  Crazy.  Pour bleach on it and fixed it.  A staph infection.  Nice.  That's what we have here.  Broken fingers.  Father used Popsicle sticks.  My dad used to do that.  Yeah.  I got so many fucking crooked fingers from playing basketball growing up.  Went to the emergency room for a bunch of them, but other times he would just put a Popsicle  stick on the damn thing.  Try to cut it out.  Oh, yeah.  See, this is the other side of this shit.  Let's go to John in Long Island.  John.  How you doing, guys?  Hey, John.  When I was about 19 or 20, I was working with a friend of mine. 
[01:56:30]  We had a sledgehammer, and the hickory handle splintered.  And as I slid my hand down to take a slam at something, a splinter broke off and lodged  between the tendon and actually my bone and my knuckle and my finger.  A big splinter, I would assume, because I know what you're talking about with that shit.  Yeah, really big and very stiff.  But what happened was it made my finger immediately bend over like as if I was making a fist, and  I couldn't straighten it out. 
[01:57:00]  So I said, oh, no big deal.  So we grabbed a buck knife and went on the picnic table and was going to cut it out.  And the moment I put the blade against my skin to start cutting, I turned like grayish  white and almost passed out.  Yeah, of course.  Because you realize what you're doing.  I think that type of stuff you can only probably do, a lot of people can do, like for surviving,  like when that guy's arm was trapped and he had to cut it off.  And I've read another story about that where a guy got trapped in a boiler, like his arm  got trapped in a boiler, and it was getting infected over two days. 
[01:57:30]  Like the metal was digging into it.  Like I think if you have to do something to survive, you're more likely to be able to  do it.  Steve, is that right?  It certainly makes sense.  The thing is, is that if he had to survive to get this thing out, although he turned  gray and started to faint, at some point he'd wake up.  And if it was life and death, he could try it again.  And you know, that guy that cut his arm off, he must have lost consciousness a dozen times  while that was happening.  Did he?  I don't know the story. 
[01:58:00]  But he would wake back up and he had the, you know, there was time for him to wake back  up and go at it again, you know, until he finally got his arm off.  But jeez, I can't even imagine what that would be like.  Yes.  And the one I read about in the boiler was bad too, where he was in this house, he wasn't,  the people didn't know he wanted to, he bought it, was fixing it up.  Right.  And his arm just got caught in whatever, it got caught in and he had to cut it off.  And the arm couldn't be, you know, it couldn't, obviously couldn't be reattached.  You know what, I forgot, Dr. Steve, recently I cut my finger really bad, cutting a stupid 
[01:58:30]  bagel.  We've all done that, right?  Yep.  And it was the weekend, I had company over, and I fucking hate the emergency room.  I crazy glued it together.  I forgot about that one.  Yeah.  And I absolutely needed a stitch.  I put some shit in there to disinfect it and then I fucking crazy glued it together.  Yeah.  Although, uh.  Because it was a clean cut too.  I knew where you could just kind of squeeze it back.  Did it work?  Yeah, it fucking worked.  Yeah.  I got a nice scar, but it's not like a jagged scar. 
[01:59:00]  Well, crazy.  Will we eventually be able to get like burn victims scarring and stuff finished with stem  cells?  You know, I think so.  I think so.  That's, you know, one of the things is, right now it's a surgical procedure to do those skin  grafts and it's just never the same.  All you're doing is protecting the skin to keep it from oozing.  And, uh, you know, eventually, surely, I mean, there's nothing in physics that says that  we can't grow a new skin.  We just don't know how to do it yet. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, uh, speaking of that, and Nathan reminded me of this.  I just read it the other day.  What are they doing with leukemia and altering the HIV virus or something?  Wow.  It just hit like two days ago.  Are you asking me or Steve?  Well, I have to do it on my show because I don't know the answer to that.  Really?  Well, fucking start Googling.  You're the doctor.  All right.  Let me get to the computer.  Well, how about the guy in San Francisco?  I'm trying to remember what it was.  Was it a stem cell thing or, uh, a guy in San Francisco?  They're doing together. 
[02:00:00]  They're modifying HIV virus.  This was something with leukemia and fucking HIV using some form of the HIV to cure the leukemia.  Yeah.  I didn't hear that.  Yeah.  This just hit.  But I only read like the first, no, no, no, no.  I only read the first sentence.  This is a guy that, um, had leukemia.  Yeah.  I know this story.  Um, okay.  He also had, uh, HIV.  Now that you Googled it, of course you know the story.  Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, sir.  I remember.  Well, it's a little different than the way that, um, that you put it. 
[02:00:30]  What it is, is this guy had acute myeloid leukemia and he had HIV virus.  He got, uh, he got, uh, and he got stem cell treatment for his leukemia, okay?  Yeah.  And when he got the stem cell treatment for his leukemia, he was also found to be HIV free.  And, uh, what they figured is, is that the stem cells that they used were of the subtype of those people who are, uh, able to eradicate the HIV virus. 
[02:01:00]  This was the guy in San Francisco, right?  No, I think it was the new guy.  I don't know.  I mean, he was an American patient.  That's what, uh...  Can I think that, was it, was it anything to do with bone marrow?  Yes, yeah, well, he had a stem cell transplant.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I believe that's, uh, San Francisco, because the gay activists, a lot of them were saying that they, they actually cured his HIV, and they very rarely claim stuff like that.  Right.  Yeah, he's three and a half years later, uh, he's HIV status, and they declared it in a peer-reviewed journal. 
[02:01:30]  So that's, yeah, that's, that's the story that you're talking about.  You think he went back to unprotected sex?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Would you, uh, Steve?  Would I?  Yeah, if you cured your HIV?  Yeah, well, it'd depend on the situation, I guess.  But, yeah, if, uh, what they're concerned is, is that he still has the virus lurking somewhere, but it's undetectable in his body, so.  Oh, but he might still have it.  It's just kind of hiding somewhere?  Yeah.  Where does, uh, something like that hide?  It ducks behind the asshole and just waits for an unsuspecting penis to come in, and then it jumps all over it? 
[02:02:00]  Like a fucking, like a crook?  Well, it's like, um, you know, shingles virus is chicken pox.  It just, uh, it hides in the central nervous system where the immune system can't get at it.  So there are places to hide in the body.  How about it stops hiding?  Where can't the immune system get in?  Uh, into the central nervous system.  Oh, the immune system, that's where herpes and stuff is too, right?  Right.  The herpes, uh, hides in what are called ganglia, which are collections of nerve cells, 
[02:02:30]  the blood-brain barrier, so when they come out in your skin, the body will attack them  with antibodies, but it never gets all of them because they're hiding in these damn nerve  cells.  It's a cowardly virus.  And the same thing, shingles does the same thing, which is, you know, shingles is a herpes  virus.  It's just not herpes simple.  Uh, by the way, uh, Dr. Steve, nice try.  What's that?  Addie in, uh, Frederick, Maryland writes,  Dr. Steve is talking about an old story. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, he's talking about a story that came out yesterday.  There you have it.  HIV virus used to turn white blood cells into cancer serial killers.  Wow.  Okay.  That is a different story.  So how about you Google that?  All right.  Well, by God, I will.  Uh, Jeff in North Carolina, what do you got?  Hey, one time, a long time ago, uh, about two years ago, I had this fifth thing on my  shoulder and, uh, it sat there for years and never changed.  Then one day it got kind of red and mushy.  And if I touched it, it just oozed out all kinds of gunk. 
[02:03:30]  And about that same time, I've heard Dr. Steve on the radio talking to the guy from  Red Eye.  He had had something on his back and, uh, Steve was explaining it, what to do to fix it.  So, uh, I got me a box cutter and some disinfectant and stuff like that.  And I went in there and cleaned out the, uh, item and everything was perfect.  Wow.  There you go.  Because of you, Dr. Steve, people are, uh, performing surgery on themselves.  No, you just said it.  Didn't you just say that?  Yes.  Say it's because of you.  So, I thought it was against, uh, specific orders, but, you know, I do what I want to 
[02:04:00]  think.  Yeah.  Right, right.  There you go.  There you go.  Thank you.  That was Bill Schultz.  Yeah, Bill Schultz had a system.  I have photos of that on my phone.  It's terrible.  I had a video and YouTube decided it was too outrageous, even though they have a video  of a dog being burned alive.  Okay.  I found that story about the leukemia, by the way.  Okay.  What do you got on that, Dr. Steve?  Yeah, it's just a, uh, this research team at, uh, the University of Pennsylvania.  They're, uh, experimenting with this harmless version of HIV.  Uh, that's the one I have. 
[02:04:30]  Uh, it sounds like, uh, I don't know what it sounds like, but they combined it with, uh,  genetically modified white blood cells and they're using them to, uh, activate, uh, the natural  killing, uh, um, function of white blood cells to, uh, kill other white blood cells.  So, yeah, this is something real, real early and won't be coming to, uh, the, um, won't  be coming to the market for years and years, but it's interesting, you know? 
[02:05:00]  Hey, and let me ask you something about that.  Let's say you have one of these life-threatening things like, uh, like a leukemia and they got  something that they're, they think might work, but they're not going to allow us to have  it for a while. Is there like a back door where you could go in and go, fuck that.  I want to try this cause I have nothing.  Yeah. I have nothing to lose.  As long as they're doing human trials and you, uh, qualify for them, there's a, there  are websites that you can go to, to look for clinical trials. And, uh, if you've tried 
[02:05:30]  the standard therapy, it's not working. And the only other thing to do is to sit back  and wait for something bad to happen. You can often get into a clinical trial and some  people will have great results from that. Other people, you know, even get placebo and  you get nothing. So it's a bit of a crapshoot, but yeah, it's out there.  Okay.  Definitely. This, uh, the thing about viruses is, is that they can do something that we  don't have the technology to do, which is to go into cells and fuck around with the 
[02:06:00]  cell's DNA. And that that's what viruses do, you know, to, and they, they co-opt the  cell so that it will make reproductions of the virus instead of making reproductions of  the cell. And, uh, you know, if you're smart, you can use that to your advantage by making  the virus drag certain information into the cell. So it'll do things that we want it to  do.  Oh, pretty interesting, uh, research. So it'd be like a virus. Okay. The day you  kind of throw something on its back and it carries it with it when it goes.  Yes, exactly. Right. Well, we got one more, uh, a lot of people need help, but this guy's 
[02:06:30]  worried about something. So we'll, we'll save this individual and the rest of the, I don't  know what to tell you. Cause we got to move on to other stuff. So good luck with, uh, your  lumps, but, uh, Dale in Georgia, what do you got?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Uh, first off, I got the remedy from Norton. He was talking to a dominatrix one day  and she said that back in the older days, that when guys got chlamydia, they would  hire these hookers, dominatrix, whatever to come in and like basically shove a pipe down 
[02:07:00]  their dick and, and get rid of all the scar tissue. Well, I have that problem. And I went  to a doctor one time, I'm in debt out my ass and I can't afford to go back to the same  urologist. So I want to ask Dr. Steve, what can I do to unblock my urethra?  Yeah. They really, the only way that can be done, if it's, if it's truly blocked, you  won't be able to piss and you'll end up with renal failure. But I'm assuming what you're  having is slow. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah. Very slow, very, uh, sporadic. Like, and the doctor that did it the first time, he  described to me, you know, when, when a beaker gets full, that's your bladder and then you  completely empty it out, you know, but mine's not completely an emptying out. So I'm having  to go to the bathroom. Like when I got to piss, I better have a bathroom or a cup or something  right then and there. Yeah. Well, I'm going to piss my pants. Yeah. Because you're, you're  never completely emptying your bladder. It's just, it's, it's, it's different degrees of  being full. And when it gets really, really full, then the pressure is big enough that 
[02:08:00]  you can push some of the urine out. And when the pressure drops down below a certain threshold,  you'll stop pissing, but your bladder will still have urine in it.  Is that with every person?  No, no, no, no. He's, he's got an obstruction and that can either happen with an obstruction  in the prostate or anywhere on the other side of the bladder. So prostate, uh, urethra,  tip of the penis anywhere.  Is that why I always piss so much? Cause I feel the same thing.  Well, um, yeah, but in the middle of the night to piss. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  How many times?  Does it burn when you piss, Norton?  No, it doesn't hurt when I piss. Uh, sometimes it comes.  I don't have an infection.  No. Oh my God.  How many times do you piss in the middle of the night, Jim?  Hard to say. I mean, sometimes two or three, I don't know.  Yeah, that's, um, that's called bacteria. And, uh, that's something I would get checked  out just because you could have a prostate infection and you could have a slightly enlarged  prostate that's causing this. And, uh, that's really easy to treat, but you're going to get 
[02:09:00]  the finger up the ass and maybe express some fluid out and to look at it under the microscope.  No, I had it. I had my prostate sonic, uh, they did like a little sonogram on it and my  bladder on it. So they're both healthy looking and normal size.  Nice.  So you've complained to them about this before.  Oh yeah. My doctor. Yeah.  Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, if they've done all of that, then, uh, it just may be the  way you are. Now this guy, uh, has, will have to get his urethra dilated if in fact  there's scar tissue in the urethra.  How do you dilate a urethra? 
[02:09:30]  You just got to pick it up and put it to your ear and go, hello.  Good one, Chip.  Yeah. Great.  I'm calling my urethra or something. Hello.  Basically they take a real shiny tube and they'll shove it up there and then they'll  start shoving bigger and bigger ones or it may be tapered. You know,  can I do that Steve or do I have to go to Dr.  I would not do this myself.  Oh, he could do it himself. That's good news, Dale. You can do it yourself.  I would not do this myself.  How does he do it, uh, Dr. Steve, now that you told him he could do it himself? 
[02:10:00]  The reason that I wouldn't do it myself is because, uh, you could really damage the urethra  and then you get scar tissue in there and it's just going to make it worse.  And, uh, you'll get any fucking worse than it is right now.  Yeah, exactly.  But it could get better with a good urologist.  Can you just get a pipe cleaner and kind of shove it in the pee hole and hope for the  best? Unblock some shit?  Maybe a Q-tip?  Anything.  Yeah.  Anything can help me.  Yeah, yeah, man.  Oh, you really, this is something only a urologist should do, seriously. And, uh, you know, 
[02:10:30]  I'm all for, uh, you know, taking care of yourself, but this is just one of those things  you just can't do.  I always feel like my bladder has stuff in it. God damn it, now I'm all freaked out.  As a doctor, Dr. Steve, can I go to a urologist even if I would money? Can he still treat  me or can he refuse me?  Yeah, well, if you owe that particular urologist money, uh, some of them will say, we won't  see you until you bring us the $250 that you owe us. But you could go to another one and 
[02:11:00]  just tell them, look, I've got, I don't have insurance or I have crappy insurance. I'm going  to need to make payments. If you tell them up front, then they won't bug you. But then  I used to use an alias. I don't think you'd get away with that anymore.  Yeah. When I was in college, I had no money and no insurance. And I, I did a couple of  things at the ER under an alias.  Tell them your name is Casey Anthony, but you spell it like the sunshine bandit.  Hey, um, uh, Dr. Steve, uh, thank you, Dale. I hope that helped you a little bit. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you, guys.  Good luck, buddy.  No, not really.  Thank you. I know I didn't help at all. I just told him to go to a doctor.  Well, that's good advice.  You're good for that. Um, I want to thank, yeah, man, you get, you're going to get a retweet  today, my friend. Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R squares. Go there now. He's got a video that he linked.  It's, uh, he writes, this is fucking gross. Gauze wick removal. You want to go there right  now, uh, Dr. Steve? 
[02:12:00]  Sure. Absolutely.  You'll probably, this will probably make you cum. This one's going to make you excited.  Good. And, and maybe you could explain what the fuck, cause this guy has some kind of  something on his back and they pull gauze out of it that has to be at least 12 to 16 inches.  Could you go back to that?  Yeah, we, we do that all the time.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  So why is there gauze in this thing and what is it?  Okay. What this guy probably had, and I, I'm looking for Palmer squares on Twitter. I don't 
[02:12:30]  see a link to a video. P-A-L-M-E-R squares. Would you smell that, that, uh, you can't  watch it?  No, I'm letting you watch it.  You got it, Steve.  No, but I, I know what it is without looking at it.  Well, it's also on YouTube as awesome after cyst wick removal.  Okay. Okay. Awesome after cyst. Okay. So here's the thing.  Um, when you have a sebaceous cyst, which is a cyst where skin is growing under the skin 
[02:13:00]  and it's got nowhere to go, it can't slough off. So it just makes a big ball and there  will be a wall around it and this cheesy, nasty smelling stuff, uh, inside there. And  if it gets in, it's a great culture medium. So you'll have a cyst that might be the size  of a marble. And when it gets infected, it will expand 10 times its size. And, uh, when  you hit that thing with, um, a, uh, scalpel, it will spew pus across the room.  Right. We all know that. 
[02:13:30]  When, when that, when you finally get all the pus out of there, you can't just sew that  thing over again because now you've got this potential space where fluid can, can collect  and it'll just get reinfected.  Yeah.  What you have to do is jam this stuff called, uh, iota form gauze in there. And it's a, it's  a strip about an inch wide and maybe, uh, two feet long. And you just start cramming  it in there until you pack the wound completely full of this gauze. And then you just put 
[02:14:00]  a, some more gauze over it and some tape and let the person go. And then every day you  pull out a little bit of that gauze.  Oh, wow.  And, uh, uh, you know, you can have the patient do it at home and you, you know, you tell them  pull out a couple inches every day.  How long does it take to do?  Uh, it can take a week, uh, maybe even longer sometimes if the cyst is really big. But what  that does is it allows the cyst to drain, uh, to get the pus and bacteria and fluid out  of there to wick it away. And then, uh, it, it will heal from the bottom up instead of the 
[02:14:30]  top down, which doesn't work.  Now, what kind of, what kind of, uh, where's Travis going? I don't know. He's got a rod.  Oh, okay.  What kind of, uh, gauze is it?  It's called iota form gauze.  How much do you owe?  Oh, no, no. I didn't mean to do that.  Oh, fuck. I fucked up everything.  I fucked up everything.  What'd you do?  Is anyone on the phone still? 
[02:15:00]  Steve?  Oh, call Steve back. I really, that wasn't my hang up bit. I was trying to conference him  with somebody and I, I fucking hung up on everyone.  I have a little cyst on my back. I'm wanting to get off.  Want to do it live on the show?  No.  Why?  Because you want to pop it?  No, I have to get it surgically removed. It's on my spine.  Um, this is going to be a cheap, uh, Twitter plug, but OP radio, I just fucking, uh, retweeted  the video of the, uh, cyst thing. So, you can go there and check out the video. I know 
[02:15:30]  it's a cheap plug and I apologize ahead of time, but it certainly will get me a lot of  followers. So, I'm not going to feel too guilty about it. Yes, Sam?  Hello?  Uh, Steve's not going to believe me, I know, but Steve? Steve?  Oh, you accidentally hung up.  I know.  That one was a mistake.  See, this is the whole cry wolf thing. You're never going to believe me, but I really, I  really did fucking, uh, do that by accident. Uh, Fezzy was distracting me. He was offering  me some fucking coffee and I'm, I, I have enough coffee today. Uh, how's, uh, Fezzy doing 
[02:16:00]  the show so far, Steve? He's sitting in today.  Good as always.  Absolutely. Two show Fezzy today.  Um, I did watch that video and, uh, that's exactly, uh, how, how we normally do those things.  Yeah. Uh, Jimmy's got a cyst on his back. Could you maybe, uh, walk me through this? Like,  let's make believe, like, we're on the space station and I, I'm the doctor cause he has no  choice and, and I, we have a doctor on the phone and I want to do the surgery on Jimmy. Can  we do this? You think?  Yeah.  Let me take a look at it, Jimmy. 
[02:16:30]  It's at the base of my spine. Uh, I've had it for years. I had to look, I had to look  that on, uh, in Philly on fucking, uh, remember the, how long ago that was? The same thing.  It hasn't gotten any bigger.  So you think you can walk me through this? Make believe we're on some kind of mountain  climbing expedition and I got to do this surgery or Jimmy's going to die. So we got a doctor  on the phone and you just talked me through it. I think we can do this today.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's right above my spine. It doesn't hurt unless I'm doing a sit-up, which would explain my 
[02:17:00]  fucking gut.  Is it red?  I know.  It's white.  It's the same color as my skin. There's no, uh, it's under the skin.  Okay.  Well, um, what I would recommend as the, uh, doctor on the ground is that if it's not red,  leave it alone.  Oh, really?  That's what, that's what the doctor told me. He goes, if it doesn't hurt, leave it.  Can I prod it a little bit?  Yeah. You can definitely, yeah, palpate it.  Yeah.  Feel it. It's right above your ass crack, right, Jimmy?  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah. I'm sure he wiped his ass really good and clean this morning. I hope you go ahead  and feel it.  Wait, why should I leave it alone?  Uh, because it's not doing you any harm right now. That's the thing. Unless it's cosmetic,  it's bothering you or it hurts or it's draining, it really can be just left alone. Now, I do  recommend that, uh, sebaceous cysts on the back, particularly if that's what it is, uh, be  removed if you, if, if you can feel them because if they get infected, it can be 10 times worse. 
[02:18:00]  Now, what you may have, if it's at the top of your ass crack is a, uh, pilonidal cyst.  Oh, shit.  And, uh, that's, that's a different thing. That's basically a giant ingrown hair and those  have to be removed surgically or they'll just keep coming back. You can't just open them  up and drain them.  Yeah. So you got to remove it surgically, but that's probably a local anesthetic, right?  Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it depends on the extent of it and it depends on the surgeon.  Yeah. You know, you can do a spinal anesthesia or they can do local anesthesia. They can even 
[02:18:30]  do general anesthesia if they got to go too deep, but I don't want to fucking needle in  my spine.  Right. Oh, I'm not saying that you should do that. I'm just throwing out.  Okay. All right. All right. All right, Steve. All right.  That's a good, that's a good to know.  Enough already.  All right. Sorry.  Uh, what's my Twitter?  Your Twitter? Opie Radio.  Uh, I mean, what's your Twitter? I'm sorry. I said that wrong.  Oh, at Weird Medicine.  At Weird Medicine. He's a great one to follow. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  He'll creep you out, but you know, he only talks about medical procedures.  All I want to do is ask Steve questions on the phone.  I know.  Like an eight year old. It's so rare you get a doctor who you can actually talk to.  I know.  Who knows everything.  It's a good morning, but we have other things to do. I mean, they're saying Bert and Ernie  aren't gay. We got to get into that after the break.  I think we just covered it.  Yeah.  Bert and Ernie aren't gay.  What do you think, Steve? You think they're gay?  I think, uh, Weird Medicine is on 10 p.m. on Saturdays on the virus.  Excellent plug.  But you, you taped it yesterday. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, we, we.  You know why I was going to call you and, and be on your dumb, uh, show, but I didn't know  where to call.  Oh.  You tweeted like, call, I'm doing the show now for Saturday. And I'm like, fuck, I don't  know what number.  If you go to that link, it has the number at the top. It's a Ustream thing. What we're  doing, we're just doing some podcasts and doing, uh, taking live calls. It's kind of  fun.  Is this?  Yeah.  No, it's not. It's horrible, but it's, uh.  I think I confuse a lot of people. Me and Steve are pretty good friends. You would never 
[02:20:00]  know it listening to us, but.  Steve, thank you for your time today. We really appreciate it.  Oh, absolutely.  Thanks, Steve.  Hope you have a good weekend.  All right. Have a great weekend.  See you soon, buddy.  Hope you grab some titties and, uh, and enjoy yourself this weekend.  I'm doing that right now.  You are? Your own titties?  Yep.  Yep.  We don't work, we don't work well together as far as comedy goes.  All right, Steve. Have a good day.  All right. There he goes, Dr. Steve. All right.  We got a break because we have live reads and shit? 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  Okay. We could do that.  I have to go tinkle. I'm going to get my bladder checked. God damn it.  Why?  I'm all freaked out.  Why are you freaked out?  I pee so much.  I really thought it was a problem, but.  You want to, like, uh, take the chance and look it up on, uh, WebMD to see what you got?  No, because I had her, the doctor, you know the doctor, the same lady.  I had her look at it, and again, she filled my bladder, she sonogrammed me, and she said  the size of the bladder and the prostate are normal.  So you're good.  And there's no, like.  So why are you freaking out?  Because if it's a blockage of some sort, I don't know what, but it's not a, it's not 
[02:21:00]  like a, like cancer or anything.  How do you know it's a blockage?  It has to be.  Why?  Why else wouldn't my fucking bladder empty?  I'll pee 10 minutes later sometimes.  I feel like I have to pee.  Hmm.  You drink a lot of coffee, though.  Oh, I drink a lot of fluid.  A lot of fluid.  And a lot of water.  Yeah, a lot of, uh, palpitating.  You just got to palpitate it.  Well, that was a, that was an all right hour and a half.  Hour and a fucking half?  At least, yeah.  Can we go home now?  Sure.  Really?  No.  We got to go watch that Joel McKeown, Louie.  Oh my God. 
[02:21:30]  What time is that at?  I'm hoping right at 10.  Yeah, we're doing the Joel McKeown.  We're going right next door to Fox.  All right.  Uh, we're going to, oh, I want to play this in a, no, we went too long.  I'll figure some shit out.  Uh, just take it, E.  Hey, this is Bob Saget.  Hey, it's Colin Quinn.  Dane Cook.  Hey, this is Jim Florentine.  This is Louis C.K.  Hey, everybody.  It's Joel McKeown.  Hey, this is Howie Mandel, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is here.  I can be profane.  Avoid the word cunt.  All right.  Jim Norton has left the show, so now it's down to me, Travis, and Sam. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  Jimmy is back on the show, so thanks, guys, for helping me out.  No problem.  Where were you, Jimmy?  Looks like you happened with Kenny.  I thought you were doing a live riff.  Yeah, I fucked it up really badly.  I don't know what happened.  You mixed up some of your words.  I did?  It's no big deal.  At least you went off script a little.  I did.  Added a little personality and flair.  Well, thank you, Sam.  That's why you're around, to lick my ass. 
[02:22:30]  Really appreciate it.  And I'm happy to do it.  Ugh.  Jesus.  Speaking of which, Bert and Ernie.  Licking ass.  Fucking, it was trending on Twitter yesterday that, you know, there's a petition out there  that these two should get married.  It's just silly.  So, people were signing the petition, which was ridiculous.  Why is Fezzy walking out of the studio constantly?  I think the Bert and Ernie thing is bothering him.  Well, he told me during the break that he said everything he needed to say about this 
[02:23:00]  on Ron and Fez, so that's probably why he left.  He knew we were doing this.  That's fine.  Fezzy will be back.  He's been filling in for Ant today, doing a fucking terrific job.  Two-show Fezzy in the fucking house.  In the house!  So, um, what do you think, Jimmy?  Bert and Ernie, gay or not gee?  No.  I don't think they're gay.  They're puppets.  They're fucking puppets.  Right, exactly.  I think the guy who created them certainly loved one.  Yeah, but what was he getting at?  Mr. Henson.  Was he getting at the fact that the guys were living together? 
[02:23:30]  No, I think there's an innocence to them that goes beyond sexual preference.  I think they were just friends who could sleep in a bed together without there being in need.  They were sleeping in the bed together?  Or wherever they were.  I think they were.  But they weren't.  What do you mean they slept in bed together?  They did on Sesame Street?  Right.  Did they sleep together?  No, I think they might have had twin beds.  Well, maybe they did.  Maybe twin beds.  I just think there's an innocence to it that's childhood-ish, not sexually oriented.  I think they were gay because they were older gentlemen.  Yeah, but again, everyone.  And none of those female puppets were around, huh? 
[02:24:00]  There was no kid characters, really, in the puppets.  I mean, look at Snuffleupagus or Bird or fucking Count Count.  How old was that, motherfucker?  No.  They have separate beds.  Let me see.  Yeah, I mean, once they...  Wow, they have separate beds when the cameras were on.  I hate these fucking ads on YouTube you have to X out.  What are you doing with those cookies in bed, huh?  Well, the cookies...  Well, I was just hungry, Bert, so I thought I'd have a few cookies before I went to sleep.  Ernie.  Beanie.  Ernie, don't eat those cookies while you're in your bed, huh?  Why not, Bert?  Because you get crumbs in the sheets, that's why. 
[02:24:30]  Gee, Bert, I get crumbs in the sheets?  Yeah, Ernie, and if there are crumbs in the sheets, they'll get in your pajamas.  Oh, crumbs in my pajamas, Bert?  Yeah, yeah, Ernie, and if you get crumbs in your pajamas, they'll make you itch.  You know that.  Oh, I don't like to itch, Bert.  No, and if you itch, you won't be able to sleep, Ernie, so don't do it, okay?  Good night.  I don't remember his voice being like that.  Oh, gee.  Hey, you want to...  Can I beep the cookie?  We should probably beep that.  What happened at the end?  Can I please hear the end?  If I get crumbs in the sheets...  What do you think happened? 
[02:25:00]  ...I'll get crumbs in my pajamas.  And if I get crumbs in my pajamas, I'll itch.  Then I won't be able to sleep.  Oh, Bert, thank you so much for stopping me from eating cookies in my bed.  All right, Ernie, just go to bed, okay?  Okay.  All right, look.  Oh, I bet he's going to go over...  I'm never going to eat cookies in my bed, A-game.  He's going to sit in Ernie's, and that motherfucker is going over to Bert's bed,  and now he's going to get fucking crumbs in it.  Move over.  All right, see, it was just an excuse to sleep together. 
[02:25:30]  These two are gay.  What the fuck?  But Ope's Rage, his voice sounds a little different.  Is that a newer one?  Yeah, I don't recognize that being the voice of...  Which one was that, Bert, I think?  Yeah, that was Bert, the anal retentive one.  Yeah, he's the Felix.  There's some gay things in there, man.  I mean, real guys don't really use sheets.  Your sheets are usually at the bottom of your fucking bed. 
[02:26:00]  I love sheets.  I make my bed.  You pull your sheets up every night?  Every night.  I despise when Comforter touches me.  Really?  I like a nice air conditioning.  And do you wear pajamas?  No, I sleep naked.  Of course.  Don't you?  Oh, pajama bottoms.  No, you don't.  Yes, you do.  Why?  You wear PJ bottoms to bed?  Yeah, but not the shirt.  Because I think the...  No, but the bottoms are terrible.  I think the PJ shirt is where it starts getting a little...  No, but why the bottoms?  I love foofy.  Why do you wear pajama bottoms?  They're comfortable. 
[02:26:30]  No underwear, though.  No, but no.  I let my penis fall out of the fly.  Why would you be nude in bed?  Naughty.  Um, because I get a little...  A little, uh, like, uh...  I need socks on, too.  You sleep in socks?  What the fuck's the matter with you?  You sleep with socks on?  I get cold.  No, that's a weird thing.  That's not...  No, I'm serious.  I get cold.  You could just put on another blanket, though.  The socks thing is very strange.  You know it's not, Sam, who doesn't eat fucking steak.  Shut up.  How do you not fucking sleep naked?  I wear PJ bottoms, and I wear socks. 
[02:27:00]  In the summer?  Yeah, but my room's, you know, it's kind of cold.  Socks and PJ bottoms?  I can't comprehend it.  Seriously?  I can't comprehend it.  Your feet don't get kind of cold, and then you feel like you've got to wrap up your feet?  No.  So I don't have to wrap up my feet, because I put on my socks.  No.  The socks are, to me, not as weird, believe it or not, as the first pair of socks.  It doesn't matter.  PJ bottoms are weirder than socks.  Socks, I could see your feet get cold.  PJ bottoms are weird.  I think the socks are weird.  The PJ bottoms aren't that weird.  Socks are definitely weirder.  They are weirder, because... 
[02:27:30]  No, they're not.  You sleep with bare feet?  I meant to say no, they're not.  You sleep with bare feet?  Of course.  I sleep with my feet out of the covers.  Why is she looking at her vagina?  She's checking it.  Because the lady has crutches, and she probably wants to think, she's probably saying, do you  have a pussy crutch?  This woman is crutching down the hall, and then the other girl bent in front of her and  lifted up her dress to look underneath it.  Like if she could.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, gimp.  Socks, PJ pants, and t-shirt coming in.  Terrible.  It's fucking terrible.  I'm totally nude when I sleep, even in freezing winter. 
[02:28:00]  Absolutely naked.  But the thing is...  Doesn't parts of your body get cold?  No, no, no.  I sleep under the...  I like it freezing.  Sometimes I do pull off the socks if the room's not cool.  Do you understand?  When it's five degrees out, because my air conditioning, I'm on a double duct system in  my fucking dumb building, so I can't get really cold AC in the winter.  I have my window open sometimes on some of the coldest nights.  When it's eight degrees out, my window is open.  You're not telling me anything I don't know.  It's freezing.  Because everyone else has their heat on it, and it rises up into your apartment, so most 
[02:28:30]  winter nights I got my windows open.  But socks are so constricting.  You assholes are losing this big fucking time, except for the guy that just called me an  eight-year-old man.  Socks are not weird, because I could see your...  I think it's weird, but I could see your feet getting cold, and to me, that's just a warmer  cold thing.  Pajama bottoms is not a warmer cold thing.  But that's why they make pajama bottoms.  Now I do.  No, I mean in bed.  I'm naked.  Underwear?  No!  Honestly, I never...  I have slept naked, but on a regular basis, I'd rather not. 
[02:29:00]  I just feel more comfortable.  I sleep in underpants.  I didn't ask you, Sam.  Those are weird.  I didn't ask you.  I sleep in mesh shorts.  Mesh shorts?  That's so weird.  E-Rock, what are you sleeping...  What the fuck?  E-Rock sleeps in full top and bottom.  I have like those sweatpants shorts.  A nightcap.  Yeah.  You wear shorts?  Wait, who else wears socks?  I'm the only sock guy.  Nobody wears socks.  It's a strange, weird thing.  No, all of you are weird for wearing fucking underpants to bed.  I don't wear underpants to bed. 
[02:29:30]  Just PJ bottoms.  Anything.  You should be naked when you sleep.  It's more comfortable.  Why is it comfortable?  Because you're naked.  Parts of your body get cold.  No, they don't.  My asshole doesn't get cold.  No, my asshole doesn't get cold.  My legs don't get cold.  I'm under the comfort of my head.  If you wore a ski mask, I'd understand it because that's the one part that's exposed.  Oh, my God.  I don't like my privates rubbing against my sheets.  I love it.  That's got some...  I'm telling you.  It's all about the penis and balls.  Scott in Chicago.  Scott.  And bottom.  Yo, I think you were molested as a kid, Obi.  Yeah, that socks thing is very strange. 
[02:30:00]  Why would socks mean I was molested?  That's socks.  It's constricting.  Huh?  A buddy of mine, he wears pajama pants, socks.  He tucks his pajama pants into his socks and tucks his t-shirt into his pants.  And he honestly worked through his stuff, he said, with a counselor.  And it was because he was touched as a kid.  It makes him feel protected.  Protected.  I'm sure that he's like an armor.  You know, he's all tight in and tucked up, so I think wearing socks makes you fewer touched,  buddy.  Sorry.  Yeah, because it's so constricting.  Well, according to Jimmy's flow chart, socks means touched as a child. 
[02:30:30]  Jim thinks pajama bottoms mean molested.  But why else would you need to feel covered in bed?  But why would they make pajama bottoms?  No, it's more I'd feel fucking cold, man.  Nah, but not in the summer, you don't.  Roland, socks?  Bare-ass naked.  Yeah, of course you're naked.  Bare-ass naked.  Of course you are.  Now, that's a nice thing to think about.  Yeah, all right.  But why would they make pajama bottoms if not to sleep in?  Like, that's what pajamas are.  Yeah, so what?  Because a lot of people wear them.  But how could it be weird if they make them?  Pajamas in case they make dildos. 
[02:31:00]  You don't shove that in your ass when you sleep.  Well, pajamas do very well on the free market.  Yeah, they do.  A lot of people buy pajamas.  Somebody bought me pajama bottoms for a year.  I'm like, what are you doing?  What the fuck am I going to do with these?  You're going to wear them?  They stink.  Actually, a lot of nights sweatpants.  I do have some PJs, but sweatpants.  What's wrong with, like, a worn-out pair of sweatpants?  Everything.  Why?  Naked.  In the summer, pajama bottoms, you mean, like, long pants?  Yeah, yeah.  That's weird.  That's weird.  It's not, because I got it nice AC.  It's childlike.  I have to be naked when I sleep. 
[02:31:30]  That's childlike.  No.  No.  I get up nude in my own house, I'm fucking buck naked, go piss shit, whatever I do.  I'm fucking naked, man.  You're the naked key.  Yeah.  A key.  A key.  A few people are saying they wear socks, so.  They're strange.  I'm not officially losing this one.  It's not looking good, but I'm not losing this one.  I sleep in socks when I'm in hotels because I'm scared of bed bugs in the beds, but other  than that, I don't sleep in socks.  And socks are going to save you?  Yes, they will.  They can't bite your fabric.  They won't bite my feet.  Yeah, but you do realize the bed bugs, you give them a chance to get inside your socks 
[02:32:00]  and now you bring them home.  Well, they'd come home with me anyway if they were going to, at least now they won't bite  my feet.  Not really.  Here's what you do, because I'm in hotels so much and I'm so bed bug paranoid, even  in good hotels, I always put my fucking suitcase never on the bed, always on that thing.  Oh, on the thing with the straps across.  Yes, and I never just, if you're naked in bed, bed bugs aren't going to come home as much  in your clothes, I don't think, as your suitcase.  What if it bites you on your pee hole?  I don't know if I've ever been bitten by a bed bug, I'm sure I have and just didn't 
[02:32:30]  know, but now I'm wondering if I was fucking touched.  I think so.  Are these the same socks you've worn all day?  Son of a bitch.  No, no, always a nice pair of fresh socks.  No, it's very strange.  Because I have trouble sleeping in socks because they're so constricting.  They are.  They're very constricting.  Don't tell me what's strange, Sam.  It is strange.  You've got so much weird shit in your head.  Well, strange knows strange.  That's true.  What?  Who's weirder than Sam and me?  Strange knows strange.  I'm admitting that I do strange things, but you have to come to terms with that yourself. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Somebody fumbled with you.  I don't know who.  I think that's true.  I am molestable.  You were a very cute kid.  Oh, yeah.  Still a good looking guy.  Very shy about sex.  Yeah, but now it's not molestation.  Yeah.  When you were a boy, you were very shy about sex when you were a boy, probably because  you felt weird.  Because it does feel good when there's a strange mouth down there, even though it's bad.  You're not supposed to be doing it.  It feels good.  A lot of people saying socks, so all these people were molested tonight.  I would assume so.  I think socks is less weird, even though I can't ever think of wearing socks in bed.  I think the constriction thing applies to molestation. 
[02:33:30]  All of a sudden I wake up in the middle of the night because my tootsies are fucking cold.  That's why I don't think it's as weird, but I don't believe them.  So then, you know, the socks take care of that.  Pajama bottoms I don't believe is a cold issue.  But in the summer, you're not cold.  Don't you want to wiggle your toesies?  I don't like dragging my nice-sized penis all over everything.  See?  It's about the penis, though.  That is what it's about.  I don't like...  That was a joke.  No, but I know, but I think it's about the penis.  I don't like rubbing my butthole and peehole on sheets.  Are you kidding?  No.  Why don't you?  The idea seems gross to me. 
[02:34:00]  Because what if there's any kind of residue or anything?  Who gives a fuck?  You're going to stick it in a girl's mouth?  That's their mouth.  That's for them to worry about.  That's so bizarre.  You should drag your penis down the street, and then you'll be cured of all that.  Just fucking drag it.  Dude, if I take a shit, I'll wipe it and get right back into bed with my fucking gaping  asshole all over it.  There you go, Jimmy.  I would never do that.  Ever.  I know.  It's bizarre to me.  Why?  Especially after going to the bathroom?  No.  I would need to have some...  Like, even if I went to sleep nude and then went to the bathroom, after I went to the 
[02:34:30]  bathroom, then I would have to put underwear on or something.  That's so silly.  It's like, it's your asshole.  Who cares?  I'm not saying I would sit on my pillowcase with my finger through my pillowcase and jam at  my asshole.  Are you diabetic, Jimmy?  People are saying you're diabetic.  I've had Patrice tell me to get checked for diabetes.  I've been checked and I'm not.  Okay.  People want to know.  No, I'm not diabetic.  The Tonight Show guys were very worried about Jim when he came taking pee breaks at Comic  Con.  Oh, yeah.  I pissed so much, but I've been tested for diabetes.  I don't have it.  It always just feels like my bladder's not empty, but again, I've had my bladder checked. 
[02:35:00]  I may have a blockage or it may just be because I drink so much caffeine.  Might be a part of it.  Let's say hi to Kyle.  This is a speed round, Kyle.  So let's go.  Boston.  Hit it.  Hey, what's going on?  Hi, buddy.  I'm 23 and I have horrible feet.  If I don't sleep with socks, the bottom of my feet crack wide open.  Well, that's a medical concern.  I mean, Opie, do you have medical concerns like that?  Are your feet like the earth?  Yeah.  Fucking no good.  Well, you know, I get the athlete's foot down because I'm a pretty good athlete, even 
[02:35:30]  at my age.  No.  I've heard.  That's why you've got the body.  I'm terrific.  Have you seen his V in that?  I'm terrific.  Fucking V is amazing.  It really looks good.  Yeah.  Now I've got to suck in my gut for the rest of the show.  It should be the Adonis and Anthony show.  It really should.  Yeah, I think we should play the beat game with the cookie thing, Sam.  Joey's saying that it's going to work.  We'll do it.  We'll try it.  Who the fuck is Joey?  Joey is...  Joey on a long round.  I don't trust Joey.  I don't like that you're using Joey as a point of reference as if...  Joey has no idea what he's talking about. 
[02:36:00]  I disagree, Jimmy.  I have wonderful ideas.  I'm not saying it's a bad idea.  I just don't know who you are.  You shot it down immediately, and it's going to work perfect.  If you beat cookies out of that little Bert and Ernie bit, it's going to sound like pussy.  Nah, it's going to sound like Cox, because Bert and Ernie are gay.  I don't give a fuck what Sesame Street's saying.  Maybe it'll sound like Common.  When What's-His-Name was doing the Sesame Street thing, you know, times were different,  and this was his way of sneaking a little something-something in there for maybe some people that were in the know.  Oh, Gregor, I don't know what you're talking about. 
[02:36:30]  Fuck it.  That's what was going on today.  Bert and Ernie slept in pajama bottoms.  Who's gay?  Who was the top, you think, if you had to guess?  Bert?  Yeah, I would think Bert.  He's a very domineering personality.  Yeah, but that could also mean that he's a submissive sexually.  And Ernie is more free-flowing, like...  Yeah, okay, I'll stick it in your ass.  Like, Ernie doesn't know how big his cock is.  He doesn't understand that he has a gift.  He just shoves it in.  He doesn't understand.  One of those retard penises.  Yeah, he doesn't understand that nine by six is something to really brag about. 
[02:37:00]  Basically said, take that fist out of your ass.  I got a penis that'll take care of it.  I got something that'll plug you just as good, Mr. Fucking Straighten Everything Up.  Come on.  So then Sesame Street, I guess, had a...  They actually released a statement yesterday, because of Twitter, saying, look, these guys  are just...  They're just pals.  No sexual orientation whatsoever.  They're just fucking puppets.  I'm for gay marriage, and I think gay people should be able to do whatever they want, but  it's like, would you guys relax?  Stop it. 
[02:37:30]  You have to make the fucking Bert and Ernie part of the club, too?  They are.  They're just buddies.  I think the turtleneck gives it away, too.  You can't pull off a turtleneck if you're a straight guy.  Yeah, or if you're a puppet with no fucking chin.  Yeah.  What?  You can't wear puppets with no chin.  You shouldn't wear turtlenecks.  My agent Pete wears mock turtlenecks, and Jonathan hates his outfits.  Really?  Mock turtlenecks.  They're like half turtlenecks.  Oh, they come...  And Patagonia sweaters.  He always wears Patagonia shirts, and it drives Jonathan fucking nuts. 
[02:38:00]  He hates Pete's shirts.  Is Jonathan nuts?  Is he a crazy person?  My fucking man...  I told you, Bill Tetley's wearing his marriage.  He's insane.  Yeah.  He's an insane person.  We were talking about Gene Kelly, and he was talking about it to his wife.  He just went, wah, Gene Kelly.  And she's like, that's not even Bill Tetley.  Did I say this on the air yesterday?  Yeah, but it's funny.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  It gives a fuck.  It's a whole new audience.  I didn't know if it was off air on it.  There's always a new audience listening, for the most part.  No, no.  I just don't want to say the same.  Except for the OCD listeners that have to listen to every fucking second, every fucking day. 
[02:38:30]  You talking about Coke Logic?  He might be one of them.  He'll sing the songs wrong?  Yeah.  Like, why?  He just makes them his own.  He'll go like, good wife, phone, not a wife, phone.  He does it around his family.  He does it around his wife.  It drives her nuts.  Yeah, good wife, phone.  Or he'll send her emails and say things like, hey, it's Bill's world.  We're just living in it.  Nice.  It's about Bill Tetley.  I didn't know her?  For no reason.  He said she fucking hates Bill Tetley. 
[02:39:00]  I saw his wife.  I forgot to ask her about Bill Tetley.  Drives her fuck.  It's ruining the marriage.  If you had brought up Bill Tetley around the two of them, would he have then started singing  the song?  Without a doubt.  He would have went.  He guaranteed.  Because Jonathan's such a fucking, like, an OCD wacko.  He would have just, it would have been stuck with him all day.  And he would have just fucking annoyed his wife with it.  I thought she threw keys at him.  I'm so happy that happened.  That's classic.  Is that a good Bert and Ernie you got ready to go there, Travis?  We're going to try another Bert and Ernie in a second.  All right.  They're making beds.  Let me say hi to Ryan in Colorado. 
[02:39:30]  Ryan.  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  Better now, brother.  Good.  Hey, man.  I was going to talk about this whole sleeping naked thing, and I'm caught in a quandary,  and I was wanting to get you guys' opinion.  Sure.  Suicide.  Okay.  I've got this really hot chick of me.  She's kind of a hippie goddess type, right?  So we've been going to bed, and she's fucking great in the sack and all the above.  But after we're done fucking, I kind of want to turn my glasses back on for only one reason.  I've gone down on her and I notice there's maybe some patchoulioid or something, but her snatch has kind of got that. 
[02:40:00]  I've been down there, and you stay down for like five, ten seconds, and you come back up.  You don't stay down.  So what she does is when we're done fucking, you know, I want to lay there naked, but her pussy smells so bad that she knows it smells because she goes to the bathroom and she gets a hot rag.  Then she comes down and wipes the cock off, and I can't tell if she knows it stinks or it's some kind of delicacy to her. 
[02:40:30]  Nothing worse than a smelly pussy.  Is it hairy or no?  No, actually.  She just got it waxed.  It's kind of a Velcro, like a Landstrip look.  I wonder if she has like, there are girls that have just like, maybe she has a yeast infection, or maybe she gets bacteria in her pussy, but once in a while there are those pussies that just stink after you fuck them.  Your phone's breaking up, man.  Yeah, we're going to have to let you go, unfortunately.  The phone sucks.  Your phone's breaking up.  Good luck with that sucks. 
[02:41:00]  Hey, Queen Elizabeth, who's one of my regulars on Twitter, she writes, as I tweeted yesterday, Bert and Ernie cannot be gay, cannot be gay.  Mouths that open like old lady coin purses cannot suck cock.  They don't have lips.  Well, that was a cruel joke by Mr. Henson.  Yeah.  Having gay puppets that can't suck dick.  Sure.  Let me say hi to Lauren who's going to defend me here in Kansas.  What's up, Loran? 
[02:41:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man, I got to defend you, dude.  I keep the house at like 58 degrees.  I got to have the socks on at night.  And no, I was not ducked up as a young kid that I know of.  There you go, Jimmy.  I don't think the socks are weird.  You don't understand.  I don't think the socks are weird.  You think every guy should sleep naked?  I just don't, it's got, no, I don't say that.  So why can I sleep with either like, I said pajama bottoms, which yeah, it's probably half  the time, and then it's sweatpants.  Everybody else.  Because you guys are shy about your penises.  You and Sam are a little shy. 
[02:42:00]  And buttholes.  Yeah, a little shy about it.  I'm not saying you're not a healthy, normal guy.  Because I don't show you my penis like you show everyone your penis?  No, no, no, no, no.  But you're a little shy about your penis.  I'm proud of it.  But you're a little shy about it.  Should we have a penis day on the show?  I don't mean with each other.  No, no, no.  Do you want to see it?  No, it's not.  I mean, I wouldn't turn away.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's like.  You know what?  Next time me and you go to the bathroom, I'm going to step back just slightly.  It'll be there for you.  I probably wouldn't look, to be honest.  My glance, I guess, just to talk about it on the show. 
[02:42:30]  I want to see Ozzy's penis.  That's the only penis I look.  That's the only guy's dick I really want to see is I want to see Ozzy's dick.  Out of respect.  What if Ozzy's penis was like awful?  Would it just bum you out?  No, I don't care.  No matter what his dick is.  Would you look at him differently?  Never.  If he was hung like a, I don't know, like a fucking, like a cherry?  No, I think he has a big dick.  I suspect he does because he has huge hands, Ozzy.  I got weird fucking hands and I do all right.  Ozzy is a fucking big-dicked Brit.  My pinky decided to stop growing after 11 years old. 
[02:43:00]  But besides that, my hand's, you know, proportionate.  I don't know.  But it's not big.  Yeah.  I think Ozzy's packing.  How much?  I don't know.  I'd probably pick him to be an eight guy.  About eight.  That's my guess.  I'm just going to ask him.  What?  I get a picture asking.  He doesn't understand.  He looks like he's going with the glasses.  What?  Hyperactive bladder, Jimmy.  Fuck.  John in Massachusetts.  You take that one pill.  The Flomax?  Yeah, that's all you need. 
[02:43:30]  John in Massachusetts.  What are the side effects of Flomax, John?  In alphabetical order.  Go.  I take Vesicare.  Oh, what is that?  The exact same thing that you had.  I mean, I'd wake up, you know, a couple times a night having to pee.  And when I did have to go, it was urgent.  What does Vesicare do?  It just makes it so that I'm normal again.  Well, at least from that perspective.  Right, right, right.  But like that and Flomax, what is it doing for you that's helping you feel like you're empty? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, well, it allows you to empty completely.  It affects, I don't know, it's something to do with the nerves down there and stuff.  Oh, okay.  You know, I have peripheral neuropathy as well, so maybe they're related.  Is that good?  What is that?  It's nerve pain in my feet and my hands.  Oh, Jesus.  So wait, I'm sorry, buddy.  So when you pee, what are the side effects of like Flomax and Vesicare?  Uh, well, you can go a lot longer than you normally would be, you know, and hold it a 
[02:44:30]  lot longer.  Uh, that's the only side effect that I've noticed.  Oh, a little bit of dry mouth sometimes, but.  I don't want dry mouth.  Yeah, well, you know.  I talk for a living, fucking peanut butter mouth.  Ugh.  That isn't all that bad.  That's probably because you're draining all your fluid when you piss.  Like all your saliva, everything, you notice that you're pissing white foam.  You're like, this is not healthy.  Yeah, it takes and draws it off from your brain and, you know, piss it out.  All right, well, I mean, I'll try that, but I don't want the dry mouth. 
[02:45:00]  How long after you take it does it start to be effective in milliseconds?  The next day.  Damn, Jeremy, let's do this for you.  I have to see if I can.  It's going to be prescribed dope.  I can't just start taking this.  I would say you just do it.  But, uh.  It's prescription.  They have, you know, two doses, five and ten milligram, and, you know, try the five milligram  and that take care of you.  You all set.  But on planes, dude, I literally can't fly unless I'm in the aisle because I'm up pissing  so many times.  I know exactly which. 
[02:45:30]  And when you have to pee, do you have to go real bad?  No, it's just uncomfortable.  I can hold it for a long time.  Like, that's why I think it's an active bladder.  Like, I don't think there's, because I can hold piss for a long time.  Uh, yeah.  On your chin?  No.  That's pretty good.  Way to, way to, way to hurt a guy's feelings.  Yeah.  It's all good.  All right, buddy.  Thank you very much.  We'll try one of those.  We're getting a request for the Chap song, maybe in a second or two here.  Oh, of course. 
[02:46:00]  But you can do what you want to do.  Just call me tomorrow, Chap.  Dan in Atlanta.  Dan.  Here's the sock thing.  For 30 years, I've been getting shit about this.  Yeah.  It's like your feet feel dry, but they don't feel cold, but they feel uncomfortably dry.  But when you put the socks on, everything's cozy.  He was molested.  Yeah.  You guys are fucked.  Not only, but not by a white band.  Obviously not.  I never thought twice about wearing fucking socks and PJs.  It's constricting and strange, the socks. 
[02:46:30]  PJs are weird to me.  I think the sock thing, if you need to know, we never had heat or AC growing up, so we  had to fucking stay warm, man.  But if you want to know the real answer, I bet you that's what it's all about.  I mean, we fucking...  And you just got used to...  Right.  And now it's just a habit, I guess.  We grew up with no fucking AC and the heat when it got really fucking cold.  We had a wood-burning stove, so if you were downstairs, you were nice and toasty.  But when you went up to your room, it was fucking cold, man.  It's one of the best feelings ever, at the end of the day, to take your socks off and 
[02:47:00]  then get right under the covers and move your toesies around under the cool covers.  Really?  I would say getting blown beats that by a long shot.  Well...  Did we get your ass eaten?  You ever have your ass eaten, Sam?  No.  Why not, Sam?  Sam, get a fucking haircut and I'll go to second place.  You never get your ass eaten?  No.  I'm not there yet.  But not where?  In fucking...  In the human race?  No.  Anal activity.  Do you have a hairy ass?  Is that why you're self-conscious? 
[02:47:30]  No, not particularly.  You don't like your fucking ass?  Oh, my God.  I'm sure I'll get there as I grow as a human being, but I'm just not there.  Wow.  You gotta do it before you get older, though, man.  Yeah, don't want to eat a 50-year-old ass.  That's for the young, man.  No fucking way.  What's wrong with you?  You never had a finger in your ass?  No.  Are you being blown?  No.  Jesus.  I mean, I've heard...  Who'd you vote for, Putin?  I've heard good things.  You've heard good things, huh, right?  I'm just not there yet.  I'm sure I'll get there, but I'm not... 
[02:48:00]  You're 30, right?  No, I'm 27.  I'll be 28 next month.  You gotta do it before 30.  30's the cutoff for ass-eating.  So I got only a couple years.  You're fucking ass-eating rules, dude.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  My girlfriend and I, a couple years ago, argued...  Not the girl I dated, but a girl...  Actually, an ex-ex...  Once removed.  We're arguing because I was talking about ass-eating.  She's like, I don't like to do that.  I'm like, why eat yours?  Because my ass is clean.  It's probably cleaner than most chicks' asses because there's no hair on it.  I mean, it's...  If I could say delightful.  But I'm like, what the fuck?  You want your ass-eating? 
[02:48:30]  And we had a real argument about it, but you bet she started eating it after a while.  Well, it's important to reciprocate.  Fuck yeah.  Like, get in there.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Hang outside like you're all hoity-toity hot stuff.  Eat my ass, bitch.  Get in that asshole.  Get in that asshole.  We got a 40-year-old that still wets the bed.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, God.  That's healthy.  But he's on his feedback.  I would love to get him on the phone.  Well, that's like Eastside Dave wet the bed until he was like 14.  Of course he did.  He said to this day...  He's an alcoholic.  Of course he does. 
[02:49:00]  To this day, he wets the bed...  He passes out.  He doesn't sleep.  Three or four times a year.  Of course he does.  Which is, I mean...  He's a drunk.  He's a drunk.  I'll do it once every two or three years.  I'll fucking...  Really?  Yeah.  Last time I did it, I remember, it was in Bonnaroo.  And I remember me and Louis C.K. did Bonnaroo together.  This was probably 2005 or 2000...  whatever.  And it might have been even when we were off the radio.  And I fucking wet the bed in Tennessee.  Oh, my God.  I woke up and I was just pissing my bed.  That's a molestation thing.  No, it's not. 
[02:49:30]  To wet the bed as an adult?  No, you just dream that you're in the water.  You just don't wake up in time.  It's all.  It's just a deep sleep.  Yeah, that's all it is.  Let me see how Denise looks like in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Why does your phone suck?  Oh, come on.  Does it really?  Hi, Denise.  Wait, wait, wait.  It might be working now.  All right, let's try this, Denise.  What's that, baby?  Jimmy, I'm like you.  I like to sleep naked, too.  Good.  But you know what?  Because it helps me relax.  I play with a little puff of hair.  A little puff of hair.  I see it all nice and neat. 
[02:50:00]  Clean up the bat wings.  It just kind of strokes the top.  But don't you feel like when I'm naked and I turn a certain way, my cock and balls get  crunched or whatever.  Or the material, I like my dick and balls to be free.  I don't like things.  I like to be comfortable.  I don't like tight clothes on my skin.  So for me, it's a skin thing.  I like to be totally...  That's why I always wear loose, baggy shirts and baggy jeans.  My dick is just so fucking big.  Yeah.  Do you like to play with your stack when you sleep? 
[02:50:30]  I'm kidding, by the way.  Yes.  Sometimes I do.  I put my hand on my dick a lot.  Like on the plane, I always have to bring my own blanket.  I'll fucking...  I have my hand on my dick.  But not all...  I'm not being turned on.  Who are these bitches?  Who are these bitches?  We should hear what we're talking about.  Who are these bitches?  Yeah.  What are these bitches doing?  Probably in here sucking some dicks.  Who are they?  I don't know.  You want me to find out?  Oh, they saw us.  Hi.  Who are you? 
[02:51:00]  I'll ask them.  Ooh.  Who are these bitches?  Who are you?  Who are you bitches?  They might be severely injured.  Oh, babe?  Oh.  Sorry, Denise.  We got bitches outside the studio.  Yeah, there's a few gals checking me out.  They probably recognize me from some sexual place.  From all your TV credits.  No, no.  Nothing to do with TV.  It's just some place I shouldn't have been.  Oh, yeah.  We saw him wandering out of a peep show.  Fucking five in the morning with his fucking...  Fucking...  With a piece of the floor tile stuck to his shoes.  Jesus.  All right, Denise. 
[02:51:30]  Thank you for that.  I miss those days.  Bye, Denise.  I haven't been into a peep in a while, man.  Those were good old days when no one recognized me.  Sambo.  Uh, they work for a company that, uh, gets sales for Sirius.  Oh, okay.  They're just regular ladies.  Yes.  They're very nice.  So obviously they don't know who we are.  Were any of them attracted to me?  Uh, I think I saw one looking towards you.  But they could have been looking at Opie in that shirt he's wearing today.  How could they not be?  Geez, I'm looking at Opie. 
[02:52:00]  We all are.  Look at those pecs.  Well, he leaves the open collars, show off a little bit of the shoulders, a collarbone.  He knows.  I've spent the last two years trying to ugly myself up.  Because I, I just can't deal with the looks anymore, man.  Well, you're not doing a very good job of that.  I'll say.  You're doing just the opposite.  Just a little tease in here every morning.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You little Abercrombie sweatpants.  Who wouldn't want you?  Exactly.  Those sweatpants don't naturally ride that low.  Of course they don't.  We know what you're doing.  Yeah.  By the way, I sometimes wear these to bed.  Do you?  There you go.  They're heavy looking.  All purpose. 
[02:52:30]  All purpose.  That is a little heavy to wear to bed.  Wants to call Sam out wearing socks at a hotel.  It's not the turtleneck.  It's the guy below with fists up their asses.  Bed bugs, though.  But Sam having a bed bug fear is not crazy in a hotel.  Has anybody ever had bed bugs?  Did you ever twist a ball because you've been sleeping naked?  No.  No.  Seriously?  Unless I'm having a break-in-two electric boogaloo dream.  And I'm fucking...  Popping the market in your sleep.  You know, I'm doing the cardboard spin. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, here's a good one.  What were you saying, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  Oh, no, no.  I was just saying I mentioned bed bugs.  And we're not hearing about them as much as we were.  But has anybody ever had them?  And what did you do?  I'm really curious.  Jess once woke up when we were in L.A.  I don't remember what hotel we were in.  She woke up with...  Obviously some shithole.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Probably the hotel that Janie Lane died in.  Some comfort in.  Wow.  Who are you kidding?  It was an affordable room, I'm sure.  Um, but she woke up with bites.  I mean, they didn't come with us on any of our clothes or anything. 
[02:53:30]  But, I mean, we were sleeping in sweatsuits for the rest of the trip.  Actually, I would have had to move rooms.  Why didn't you move rooms?  I think they were all full or something.  I would have told me a bed bug that I'm calling the health department.  Unless you had me...  And then they would have found you a room.  Oh, yeah.  They would have found you a fucking suite.  We...  I guess we don't have the clout.  Huh?  We don't have the clout.  You should have asked.  I know.  I know.  I'm obsessed.  I don't even look...  I don't even check in the room.  Because I figure I'm only going to be in a hotel for a couple of nights.  And I'm careful.  Like, I put all my stuff on a glass table.  Like, on the coffee table.  Anything that I would normally have thrown over, like, on the bed. 
[02:54:00]  Or I put on the fucking coffee table.  Like, my, uh...  Like, any little bags I open, I put on top of the glass coffee table.  I am not bringing those fuckers home.  Hmm.  One more call here.  We got Mike in Jersey.  Hi, Mike.  Mike.  Hi, guys.  If I sleep with socks on, I will jizz my pants.  Okay.  Now, can everyone agree that he was molested?  No, he should have been.  Mike.  There's too much cum saved up.  That's a great line.  And now I have to ask, because we really try to keep it real.  Are you fucking around, or is this something that happens? 
[02:54:30]  I swear to God, absolutely.  I mean, I haven't...  Why do you jizz your pants if you wear socks?  Nocturnal emissions if his feet are warm?  Why?  I have no idea.  I haven't done it in years, obviously.  But, uh...  Would Dr. Steve know this one?  Definitely.  I don't want Dr. Steve.  Well, you know what it is.  It's when you're feeling, uh, when your feet are bound, you feel like a Japanese woman.  And, uh, that's clitoral fluid.  Oh, by the way, uh, hold on in a second, because Stephen asked for Bayshore.  He's always terrific. 
[02:55:00]  What do the Jews do now?  He said that, uh...  Oh, he had the name of your girl.  Um, blank.  Because...  We say Jess, right?  Yeah, we're just...  Okay.  Jess got bitten by weevils that hide in Sam's woolen fro.  How dare you?  That's creepy.  Bed bugs are creepy, man.  They're the worst.  Fuck.  Um...  They just live with you.  That's gotta be awful when they permeate your home.  And they're on everything.  Everything.  Everything!  Everything! 
[02:55:30]  Mike, why do you choose your pants?  Because you have socks on.  I don't know, guys.  I mean, it's one of those things.  I think, like, I just passed out drunk one time.  I woke up with a puddle, and I'm like, okay.  And then after a couple times, I just noticed it, and I just made an effort not to wear socks.  Yeah, but let's be honest.  Every once in a while, you put the socks on, because it feels good, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  It's very strange.  We need a psychologist to figure that shit out.  I bet there's a light tickling of the sock fabric, and he probably moves his little feet back and forth, and it relaxes him in his dream. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Do you like your feet, uh, played with?  No, not at all.  Yeah, don't touch my fucking feet, and don't touch my fucking nipples.  I like my nipples and feet sucked.  Your feet sucked?  I have my feet sucked.  Hey, bitch, stick these in your mouth.  Really?  I've got a pond of these for a while.  For you.  Let her know what it is.  Yeah, let her know what it is.  I got cloudy toenails.  I don't want anyone touching my feet.  You're insecure about your feet, I think.  Yeah.  No, I took a pill for that.  They're clear now. 
[02:56:30]  Ew.  Cloudy feet?  There was a time where I had cloudy toenails.  What are you, an American Indian?  And they started to get a little thick.  Chief cloudy tootsies.  Right.  There is a pill for that, but it fucks up your lever.  What's the pill called?  My lever's good.  I had a little fatty, a slight fatty liver, but Dark said that's normal because of the  American diet.  What is the-  But it also could have been caused by this fucking pill I had to take to get rid of my  cloudy toenails.  I don't remember.  I think I've seen the ads for it.  You have to go like three or four months. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Cloudy toenails.  The guys out there know what I'm talking about.  And maybe a few of you girls do.  Fingernails and toenails.  It's a fungus thing that makes them all cloudy and kind of, ugh.  How come the whole finger isn't covered in nail?  It's just an odd thing on the end of the finger to have.  Well, imagine if the whole finger was covered in nail.  No, Sam.  Yeah, I guess not.  We're going to take a break.  Sam just fucked the flow up.  Yeah, thanks a lot, Sam.  That was something Jim brought up and I was expanding on it. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, but you didn't.  You just kind of stopped it.  Fez has been here three and a half hours.  He didn't fuck up the flow.  Nope.  Two-show Fezzy in the fucking hay-os.  He's been good.  We're going to wrap up next, I guess.  When are we seeing this movie, Jimmy?  Roland's willing to email me back.  He said that clap is, um...  Oh, shit.  Don't take the Flomax.  Why?  What's it do?  Not going to tell you, but it's not good.  Well, tell me.  No.  Can't tell you.  I have to know.  Nope. 
[02:58:00]  What do you do with Flomax?  Nope.  Flomax.  It sounds like two people named Flomax hanging out or something.  What?  You want to know what the Flomax does?  I do, yeah.  A lot of people say, don't take that shit.  Okay.  All right.  Let me go to this one first.  Chris and South...  Makes you shit blood.  No notice.  What is SD?  South Dakota?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Tell you, buddy.  Hey.  Hey, man. 
[02:58:30]  What does Flomax do?  What does Flomax...  Hey, Jimmy.  Good morning, guys.  What's the problem with the Flomax?  Oh, shit, man.  What's the problem with Flomax?  I don't know if it was Lamacil, Dr. Steve.  Another doctor...  Oh, that's Dr. Steve, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve?  The Dr. Steve.  The Dr. Steve is saying Lamacil.  I don't know if I was on Lamacil.  I remember my doctor at the time, who I think died because he didn't take care of himself,  opened up a big fucking drug book, put on his glasses, and then decided what drug  to give me for my cloudy toenails. 
[02:59:00]  I'm not sure if it was Lamacil, but I know that's one that treats it.  Anyway, Chris, go ahead.  Sorry.  Yeah, they put me on...  I'm pissing just like you, Jimmy, and they put me on Flomax.  I took it for about four or five days.  I was so fucking dizzy, so fucking floaty, driving down the road, working and shit.  I just...  Pissing all the time was better than feeling that way, man.  I'm no doctor, but I'm wondering if you were dizzy because now you're relieving yourself  of your fluids, making you a little dehydrated. 
[02:59:30]  Ah, it came and went.  I was on two different medications, a powerful antibiotic and that, and that.  I stopped taking it, and I felt better instantly.  It just...  I couldn't function on it.  You start reading...  Every drug comes with that disclaimer of the side effects.  You read that shit, do you really want to take it?  Right.  I guess it, uh...  I mean, I would try it, but if I had the dry mouth...  Try it.  You'll like it.  I, uh...  Try it.  You'll like it.  And I'm with Jimmy on Sleeping in Bed.  I used to sleep fucking buck. 
[03:00:00]  My wife thinks it's disgusting, so I limit it to underwear.  I used to fucking talk about my feet.  I love the cold sheets and cold bed.  Yes!  I go to sleep.  Fucking love it.  My wife thinks I'm nuts.  When I was a kid, I used to always sleep on the kitchen floor, under the kitchen table.  Because it was cool, and I used to put my pillow on the fucking air conditioner.  Jesus.  For a while before I went to bed.  I also had a water bed for a while when those things were in, and I could never get the temperature right, so the fucking... 
[03:00:30]  I was always fucking cold in my water bed.  You were just sleeping on cold water?  Yeah, a block of ice.  Like a flea.  The water bed people understand.  If you don't get the temperature right, you either bake your ass off, or you're too cold.  You gotta get...  I don't even know what the proper temperature was.  What an uncomfortable thing.  Do water beds still popular anymore, or no?  No.  They're not, right?  Because of comfort top mattresses and all that shit?  I never liked my water bed.  You said they're terrible.  They're bad for your back. 
[03:01:00]  Are they?  They're cold, yeah.  I used to have to put my pillow on the wood frame, because I needed something stable.  I never understood floating like that.  And then you would get mold, because you didn't take care of it properly.  Some water would always spill out when you were trying to refill it.  You had to change the water?  No, I never changed it.  Oh.  Never.  Not once.  Fuck that.  A fucking water bed...  I mean, there's nothing gonna build up in it.  Like, it just seems awful.  Yeah.  Squishing.  Could you make it harder by filling it more?  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  Fucking on a water bed seems awful.  Oh, yeah.  It was like fucking a fat check.  Every time.  I don't know.  John in Brooklyn.  What's up, John?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, John.  Listen, Jimmy, with the Flomax, I had the same stuff that you had.  It's just something to do with the nerve that goes to one of the muscles over there, whatever.  Anyway, Flomax, everyone's missing the main side effect.  Yep.  When you make cumzies, nothing comes out.  Yep.  Everything feels like you're about to fire off, and nothing happens. 
[03:02:00]  Yep.  What?  What?  Why?  Abnormal ejaculation is the number one side effect.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  And there you go, Jimmy.  Occurring in 18% of people.  Yep.  And Jimmy, you know you're into a lot of cumzies, so, you know, you might get offended with that.  No, but I, dude, I wish it was more.  They said, like, when you cum, it will last for three minutes and be like silly string.  What?  What was that?  Abnormal ejaculate.  I heard you!  No, but I was repeating.  Oh.  I'm going to fall for my own gag, but I would have, but I wasn't repeating. 
[03:02:30]  Abnormal ejaculations, runny or stuffy nose up to 18%, infections including the common  cold or flu up to 10.8%.  Dizziness.  I'm getting a communique here.  Yeah?  I think it's normal you wear socks to bed.  It's strange that you duct tape your asshole shut at night.  That's funny.  Well, what are you going to do?  You've got to protect yourself from the molesters. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  Dr. Steve checking in again.  Flomax can drop your blood pressure.  Flomax sounds terrible.  I know, exactly.  Why don't you just cut your own fucking, cut your fucking bladder out and throw it in the  garbage?  I don't understand the drugs that take care of the one problem, but give you all the  other problems.  I don't know.  That's so stupid.  Why don't you just stay with the original problem?  Because I think a lot of drugs are like cleaning your room.  Like, you don't throw stuff out.  You just take it from one end of the room and you put it in the other end of the room  so the one end is better, but all this shit's piled up in your closet. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, you can't open the door because it'll all fall out.  Right.  That's what some medication seems to do.  Ah.  Is there anything that works better than Flomax, though?  Does Dr. Steve know?  And can give you some cum, too.  Yeah, that will at least want to, because my cum...  Yeah, Jimmy needs cum.  Yeah, I mean, especially with...  I normally, I was voted a boy most likely to have a viscous load three years in a row.  Dad took Flomax, had to have surgery.  Why?  On his prostate. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, because he forgot to piss a lot?  Oh.  Seven years ago today, my dad was in a horrific...  Oh, today is?  No, it was yesterday, but seven years ago today, he was in a horrific coma waiting to die.  Just thought I would share.  I was thinking recently, we've been back on for seven years.  I didn't realize that anniversary was coming, too, but it's fucking almost seven years.  That's October...  October 4th.  4th is our first show.  Seven fucking years.  Yeah.  I can't believe that.  Yeah.  Seven years.  Tomorrow, I lost my pops. 
[03:04:30]  It's all right.  At least you won't have to work.  What?  At least you won't have to work.  Oh, no.  I mean, to the people that go through this, it's...  It becomes something different.  That's the best advice I could give to anybody.  It just becomes something different.  For the first few years, it was just...  The 11th, 12th, and 13th of August were brutal fucking days.  But now, it's just something different.  It's okay.  It's all right.  I don't know if I remember anniversaries like that. 
[03:05:00]  Dates?  Well, how do you...  You've got to remember the day your dad died.  I mean, your dad's alive, but I'm just saying, that's when you're going to remember.  Trust me.  But I don't know if I...  Because I don't put much stock in birthdays, either.  Like, tragic dates, like people I know who have committed suicide or whatever.  Do I have any connection to those dates?  And, like, if I think about it, I feel sad.  But do I feel like, oh, no, the anniversary of that's coming or no?  I really don't.  I think it depends how close you were to the person.  Maybe.  And friends, that's maybe a little different.  Because we all have friends.  We don't know when their fucking birthdays are. 
[03:05:30]  I don't know when Ann's birthday is.  I don't know when yours is because every day is your birthday.  But are you a birthday guy?  Let me guess.  You're July 19th.  Yes.  All right.  So I finally got that one.  And is April...  Does anyone know?  Is he April?  I don't know.  April something.  I know it's April.  Whatever it is, I hope he doesn't see his next one.  Jesus.  No, it doesn't suck, Stephen.  That's for me, sure.  It really doesn't.  That's why I bring it up.  It becomes something different. 
[03:06:00]  But it did fuck up the show.  We're going to break anyway.  You want to break and then we'll finish up?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do that.  There's something else, but I don't know.  Some good phone calls.  If you're on hold, stay there.  We'll wrap up with phone calls next.  You can do what you want to do.  Just call me tomorrow, chap.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America and south of the Mason-Dixon line. 
[03:06:30]  Please, Jim, give it up.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right, man.  I'll tell you where we're going to go with the funny land.  He's back with an all-new CD, Where Are We Going?  What a term I see for breakfast.  Oh, well, Billy.  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  Buckman.  Buckman. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do.  Here we go.  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right.  What's Mary short for?  She's got no legs.  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman.  And his all-new CD, Where Are We Going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere.  Oh, and I thought you were...  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do ya?  It's all about me.  Is it? 
[03:07:30]  I...  I was assaulted.  Were ya?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  That sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did ya?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Is it?  Jimmy has left the show.  So, it's me and Travis.  And, of course, Fezzy.  But Fezzy's gonna leave in a couple minutes to get ready for a second show.  I'm still in the room.  Two-show Fezzy.  No, I know.  He's gonna leave in a few minutes, he told me. 
[03:08:00]  Still here.  Yeah, I know.  He's doing great, man.  No, I'm still here.  Sam.  What?  You mentioned everybody except...  Hi, Sam.  Except me.  You just didn't mention.  I'm still here.  Uncle Sully in Beacon Hill.  I was talking about how, like, this is a weird time of year for me.  My dad passed away seven years ago tomorrow, but he wasn't hit.  He was in a massive car accident on the 11th.  The 12th, he was in a coma. 
[03:08:30]  Early on the 13th, he died.  So these three days are weird, not as bad as they used to be.  It became something different.  And Uncle Sully writes, Opie, has having a son made it better?  That's a good question.  Not really.  It makes me miss my dad more, but what a son did was made me realize officially that I'm  gonna die someday.  Oh, my God.  That's what a kid does to you. 
[03:09:00]  Because you see him continuing on your legacy, which means one day...  Yeah.  ...you won't be there to do it.  I mean, everyone knows they're gonna die, but you kind of don't think about it.  But when you have a kid, you realize, holy shit, I'm gonna fucking die someday.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  You must know what I'm talking about.  You missed a great one, Jimmy.  Yeah, I just walked into the middle of an uplifting moment.  I was pissing.  No, fucking Sully wants to know if having a son made it easier about my dad not being around.  Not really. 
[03:09:30]  It made it a little tougher.  It made you face your own mortality.  Yeah, but we don't want to talk about that, Sam.  We want to talk about you and getting your ass licked.  That's fair.  I mean, I guess any topic is...  We've got Joey in Nevada.  Joey!  Hey, what's up?  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, Joey.  By the way, it's birthday April 20th.  I was gonna guess the 19th.  4-20.  I knew it was in April.  That's good.  No, no.  What?  Nothing.  Travis said you're wrong. 
[03:10:00]  About Ant's birthday?  Yeah.  He's getting a little lippy.  Oh.  Who told you that?  It's not the 20th?  Ouch.  I think whoever told you that is saying that's Hitler's birthday.  Oh.  Okay.  But I didn't know if you were going with the bit or not.  Oh, wow.  Just pretend you were going for the bit.  Sure.  For the bit.  For the bit.  When's his birthday?  It's in April.  No, we all know that.  In the 20s? 
[03:10:30]  Go ahead, Joey.  I don't think I'd have to get her intoxicated and all that.  I'm just not.  As I said, I'm not there yet.  Sam, are you open to the possibility of getting your ass licked?  Yeah.  I mean, in my lifetime?  Yeah.  By Eric.  By Eric?  Sure.  Yes.  But we're saying you can't do it after 30.  Well, then I have two years. 
[03:11:00]  Why don't you have a clean ass like Jimmy?  Jimmy's the exception to the rule.  We all understand.  Most people, though, at 30, they shut down the ass.  The ass play.  I'll work to maintain a clean rectum.  You're not going to get your ass licked, are you?  No.  Not today.  He's fucking Tim Timid.  At some point, I'm sure it will go down.  Life is long.  26th of April.  It just came to me.  I can't picture Sam fucking.  I can't picture you fucking either because you're my friend. 
[03:11:30]  It's weird to see me being a friend.  Or aunt, really.  Travis was once quoted with some of his fellow staff members saying something to the effect  of, I would love to see Sam having sex.  No, but I understand that.  Which really creeped a lot of people out.  You can't see your friends being...  How great would that be to see all of us having sex?  How creepy that would be.  In the same room?  I think Kenny fucks like a lion.  On the same cracker.  Do you think Kenny fucks like a lion?  I don't know.  Kenny, how do you fuck? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Hell of a way to the end of a great show.  Fuck.  I put no effort into it.  No?  For what?  I think Kenny...  I think Kenny is straddling and wrap his arms under the woman's shoulders, face in the  pillow guy, and hump away until he's done.  I think there's a lot of just uncomfortable grunting.  You know he's been laying a lot of pipe lately.  Who?  That's Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  He's been fucking like an animal.  He likes to fucking party. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Does he?  Yeah.  He's fucking like...  Where's Troy?  We haven't heard from you today, Troy.  Multiple chicks in a given week, you know?  Oh, is he dumping a lot of loads?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think he's enjoying being single more than I am.  Notice what Sam did.  I fucked Noah.  This was about you and getting your ass licked, and all of a sudden we're talking to Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan, you fucking laying some pipe lately, or what?  I don't know where he's getting his info from.  Well, he came on the after show and said that he looks at women as orifices.  Oh, right.  No, I said...  And what do you do with an orifice, but fuck it.  Am I right?  He sends you naked pictures, too.  I saw him on the phone. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  No, I just don't have any use for a relationship right now.  So the only thing I'm interested in is just the hole.  I thought you were going to say I have no use for a pussy.  No, I mean, I always have use for that.  But have you been banging chicks, or no?  A little bit, but I don't really want to go out of my way for it.  Do you lick ass?  It falls in my lap.  What's that?  You lick ass?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, I see Troy.  Troy, he's an older guy than me, you know.  And he said, open that shit up like a head of lettuce.  I mean, fucking get in there, dude.  Troy also was exposed to a lot more in the world than I have been so far in my life.  You dated black chicks. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, but Troy was in a band, and he...  You know what kind of a ride a black chick gives you?  No, obviously.  So you should know some shit by now, Sam.  Well, I mean, I know some shit.  I just have not ventured into the world of ass play at this point in my life.  I don't think that's so, you know, it just not happened.  Why not?  Because I'm not there yet.  Are you a dirty talker in bed?  No, I'm fairly quiet.  I can't picture Sam doing anything other than, like, missionary position.  No, I picture Sam as a fucking doggy style guy.  I picture Sam having sex with a sheet in between him and his lovely fiancée. 
[03:14:00]  Opius, right.  So how do you fuck?  Are you a doggy style guy?  I've done both positions.  Of course you have, but what is your preference?  Um, it depends on the given mood.  So, like, if you're horny, how will you initiate?  Will you say something to her, or will you just start kissing her neck?  Uh, kissing her neck.  I don't do a lot of dirty talking at all.  Because...  What do you do?  If it's not reciprocated, I feel silly.  And the risk of that is...  I don't want...  Tell her to talk dirty. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  Say it, say it.  Yeah, but I don't want her, I don't...  Because then in my head, I know that she's saying it because I asked her to say it, and  then it doesn't mean anything to me anymore.  No, I get that.  But eventually, sometimes you're right, and I'm agreeing with that.  I am the same way.  It's not a turn-on to me.  It's not organic.  But sometimes you have to unlock it.  Like, sometimes if you unlock it, yeah, at first they're doing it for this.  But don't forget, they're little pieces of shit, too.  Like, in all women, they have that fucking filth in them.  Oh, yeah.  So sometimes you're just unlocking that.  If and when she talks dirty, I'm very entertained by it, but I don't... 
[03:15:00]  It's not...  I'm very entertained by it?  Yeah.  You don't...  What's the matter with you?  He's just so not sexual at all.  That's exactly it.  I don't know why...  What's your religion?  I was not raised terribly religious, but Baptist Protestant would be the religion.  Yeah, I heard the Protestant in there.  Well, I'm not sexual...  They're a bunch of weirdos.  You guys, no.  Do you eat ass?  No, no, no.  There's no...  He's never...  Here or there.  It hasn't...  I'm not there yet.  Dude, if you're not eating her ass or you're not having your ass eaten by now, it's never 
[03:15:30]  going to happen.  You don't think so?  No, because when you're in a relationship with a girl, it's like you don't start...  If you don't start from the get-go, it's not going to happen.  And once you've eaten ass for a while with a girl, you're just kind of like, I'm not  eating her ass anymore.  I'm in a relationship with her.  It's like playing the guitar.  I mean, you don't pick up a guitar in your late 20s and think you can play it.  Yeah.  But you don't explore new things as the relationship progresses?  No, you stop having sex.  What the fuck?  How naive?  You start having sex with other people.  That's how it works.  Jim, you're pissing a lot because you jerk off too much. 
[03:16:00]  Do you know what, man?  That fucking might be accurate.  You're swelling the area up.  God damn it.  You're leaving less room for pee.  That's probably right.  I jerk off like a chimp where I just don't even come.  How do you do it, man?  Where do you get the energy from?  Do you understand my, I sit on my sofa, I've been writing, obsessively writing into my  notebook and in my fucking, I do that, I play chess with friends, I've been watching  The Sopranos and I fucking have been reading.  I do, I'm doing things all day, weird things, all to stop myself from just jerking off every 
[03:16:30]  moment.  How many times a day do you jerk off?  I don't, I sometimes will just come once every two days or once a day, but I just jerk off  and don't come.  I stop.  That's weird.  Yeah, that's a little weird.  I've never understood that.  It's a high, dude.  Yeah.  Once I come, then I have to face reality.  But isn't the high, isn't the high completing it?  No.  I understand, like, I understand trying to make yourself last, but then you gotta eventually  let it go.  I did last night.  Nice.  Screaming?  No.  It was just like, I hate when I sit on the sofa and jerk off because my stomach is bent  in. 
[03:17:00]  I have to see my fat stomach.  Rubbing my dick on my stomach.  It's creepy.  All right.  Troy, thanks.  I'm glad you're banging chicks and stuff.  I'm not.  I don't know where he's getting that information from.  How many times a week do you bang?  Why would you want the world to know you're banging chicks?  He bangs like at least once or twice a week.  And for a single guy, especially working this schedule, that's a good number because  it's lots of different women.  No, it's not.  I can't get a date.  How do you do it?  He's banging all the time.  No, I'm not.  I don't.  He downplays it because that's his thing.  You think he goes to DJ gigs and all the chicks are like, oh, look at the cool DJ. 
[03:17:30]  And then he fucks them.  Yeah.  Troy makes chicks wet.  Yeah.  You do, right, Troy?  I don't know.  Do they get moist panties when they're around you?  Nah.  You don't think girls get wet around you?  I'll bet they do.  Yeah, Troy.  Especially when you're pumping out the jams.  Kenny, if you were a girl, would you get wet around, Troy?  I'd be on my knees by now.  By now.  Doing what?  I'd suck his cock.  He's looking at my cock while he's saying that. 
[03:18:00]  He has to look down at my cock while he's saying it.  Of course he does.  Fucking weirdo.  That's creepy.  It really is creepy.  Oh, fuck this guy.  I'm sexual around jazz, but I'm just not sexual.  No, I know that, but I pick up people's vibes pretty well.  Not directed towards me, but it's like, you know, because I'm an addict, you just kind  of get intuitive with that stuff.  Yeah.  What about your masturbation, Sam?  What about it? 
[03:18:30]  How many times a day?  Not, I would say once in a day would be the max.  Really?  Not the max.  You masturbate once a day?  No.  In a day, I would only do it once.  Do you jerk off more than once a week?  I probably, maybe two to three times a week in an average week.  Now, do you look at porn?  Yes.  Wait, you're whacking off now?  Two to three times a week?  Right now?  No, I'm not whacking off right now.  No, you know what I mean, like...  Yeah, but sometimes I'm, I don't have, if I have time, or I'm not tired. 
[03:19:00]  What porn?  Whatever I can find on the red tube.  What do you like?  The blowjob stuff?  The fucking, the anal stuff?  Uh, intercourse.  Vaginal intercourse.  That's, that's, I can never jerk off.  You like looking at penises going into vaginas.  That's right, that's vaginal intercourse.  Now, when you watch them, do you picture that being your penis?  Uh, yeah.  What, uh, what position do you like?  There's one, there's always one that we like to find.  Uh, I like a position where the man is standing, and the woman is like, on a couch or a table, 
[03:19:30]  or on a surface.  Slumped over like she's fucking drugged up.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, on her back.  Oh, okay.  Wow, yeah, that's a, you know.  I like to watch an Inari Vox blowjob, like that sloppy spit blow, like that's what I need  to fucking blow my load.  It's nice.  What about you, Kenny?  I have no privacy.  Yeah, Kenny's not allowed to jerk off.  There's nowhere in his house.  But if you could.  Just jerk off on the drive home?  Yeah, you should jerk off on the drive home.  Exactly.  Parks in front of the fucking local grammar school. 
[03:20:00]  Jerks off in front of the jungle gym.  You should whack off on the way home, Kenny.  Today.  Yeah, you clear stuff all over your suit, so it looks like you laminated a fucking zipper.  Yeah, just unzip your fucking big fucking suit pants and you go to town.  All right.  Can you do it while Sam's on the after show?  Yeah, will you call in and jerk off over the phone for the after show?  Yeah.  I appreciate that.  Kenny just says stuff.  He doesn't really know.  He's not going to do it.  No, I called yesterday.  You did?  Yeah.  He did.  And what happened? 
[03:20:30]  He was one of the many guests on the after show yesterday.  Yeah, because I had to make a bring to everybody's attention how he doesn't care about Troy if  he lived or died.  I jokingly said I don't care about Troy.  It wasn't a joke.  Okay.  What's your problem with Troy all of a sudden?  Sam's changed.  He's using foul language on his It's One show now.  I didn't know that was an XL channel.  I'm not using foul language.  What was the word?  Kenny has told this to every single person that he's seen today.  I've heard this story nine times today.  You can't deny it.  What's the language?  What was the language?  Tell him, Sam. 
[03:21:00]  Are you proud?  Tell him.  I said Danny McBride is going to be on the morning mashup this morning.  That's right.  Kenny effing powers.  Right.  What's next?  The N-word?  Damn.  He's used that joke.  What's next?  The N-word?  25 times today.  Every single person he's passed in the hallway while I've been there, he said, what's next?  I always feel special when Kenny talks to me until I realize that he tells everyone  the exact same thing.  I'm just the opposite.  I feel special when he's talking to anybody but me.  He does the same conversation over and over. 
[03:21:30]  All that Adam Levine from Great Neck is Sharp.  He says, doesn't Kenny drive you home, Hope?  Well, he does, but not today because me and Jimmy got to go to a movie because Joel McHale  is coming in next week.  That's why I said, Kenny, jerk off today.  Who on our staff is?  We have to, by the way, the staff lunch I didn't forget about.  I still want to do that for the guys that went on stage.  Remind me of that.  I do want to do that.  I just was away this week.  Who else is coming to the movie?  I don't know.  I can't go.  I got a show to do.  We should go now, though, because I think they're starting at 1030 for us. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, let's go.  Jimmy, you got Utah next week?  Utah next Friday, Saturday, Salt Lake City, Wise Guys Comedy Club.  My first and last probably gig in Utah ever if it doesn't sell out.  Now, you'll do well, right?  I hope so.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Comedians David Tell and Jim Norton remember when men were wild.  What is that?  Norton is also a veteran of the late night scene for comics,  and most people know him from Opie and Anthony.  Where's that from?  CNN, I guess. 
[03:22:30]  Just has something.  Hit play.  Will that not play because it won't let you play?  It's not authorized for this country.  I tried to click on a link last night with me and a tell,  but they wouldn't let me play it.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  But that just came on Google Alerts.  All right.  Okay.  I think we did it.  Yep.  Hopefully Ant's feeling okay,  and we'll see you guys Monday.  Monday.  Great show, you two.  Yeah, we know.  Okay.  They don't have to tell us.  No shit.  Sam was the hole today.  Good one. 
[03:23:00]  Way to end on a high note.  See what I mean about him doing the same jokes over and over?  Yeah, we all kind of heard that during the break.  No, we laughed then.  Did you do it during the break?  Yeah, he tries out his stuff.  You jerk.  I was in the bathroom.  He tries out his stuff.  And none of us laughed,  but he still felt like he had to try it.  Nobody's laughing.  Right.  Practice makes perfect.  That's a good philosophy.  Kenny, what are you doing this weekend?  We never ask you.  Nothing.  He's just going to sit there looking at the clock for Monday to come. 
[03:23:30]  What will be the highlight of your fucking weekend?  Going to the gym.  Okay, that's nice.  You like that.  Yeah.  And then what?  I don't know.  I'll probably have a nice meal.  Does Kenny ever call you when he's driving to the gym?  He calls you too?  Yep.  I always feel special.  When you hang up on him, when you finally get him off the phone,  he's just going through his phone book to call someone else.  That's all we are is time killers while he travels.  And then he has the same, as I said,  he has the same conversation that he just had with you.  Then he'll call me and have the same conversation. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Thank you.  Fan gathering late September, September at FH Riley's.  People better start planning on attending now.  Why?  How did they do that, Steven S.?  I wish I knew.  Well, it'll be big enough for everybody.  Yeah, maybe I'll show up to that.  That'd be nice.  We haven't done a gig at FH Riley's in a while.  I'm taking it nice and easy now because it's 10 o'clock. 
[03:24:30]  This hour don't mean shit to me anymore.  You do.  You just kind of, and then eventually you'll just walk out without saying goodbye.  That's right.  Let's walk over to that movie and see who else is coming.  Yeah, we should do that.  We really do have to go.  Guys, enjoy your weekend.  See you Monday.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Greatly appreciate that.  Sam's going to continue with something.  You got any guests booked or anything?  Not yet.  Yeah.  Who?  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  You won't be here.  You're going, are you going to stay?  No.  You just wanted to plug your Facebook?  Yeah.  Where's my fucking wallet? 
[03:25:00]  Did you lose your wallet?  No, I might not have brought it.  Oh.  I'll get this one.  Good thing the movie's free.  I saw your wallet earlier on top of the books.  Oh boy.  You're doing the 10 o'clock thing.  He wants to believe me, but he's not sure.  No, I'm pretty sure I left it home.  What if I said I saw it?  I mean, why would you lie?  I wouldn't lie. 
[03:25:30]  But you would.  Do you have your keys?  What?  Yeah.  Okay.  Why wouldn't I?  Sam, you're right.  Now we just got to walk out.  All right.  See you guys.  This is a horrible ending to an okay show.  It was a very good show.  Better than okay.  It was an okay show, Sam, but now it's a horrible ending.  What could have been better?  Yeah, well you fucked it up.  I said what could have been better?  You should have opened up about your ass eating.  I did.  I was very honest and frank with everyone.  You definitely like your... 
[03:26:00]  Ow!  Ah, see what happens?  God damn it.  You see?  You say terrible mean things and you end up hitting your head.  You're holding back on the ass eating thing.  I'm not holding back.  I don't engage in ass play.  You don't really want...  At this point in my life.  You don't want to do that, right?  Not at this point in my life.  I'm not there.  I said that.  I was very honest.  How many times can you fuck?  In a given...  In what amount of time?  Can we get your mom on the phone?  Yeah, of course.  She's always down.  Really?  Well, for a phone call. 
[03:26:30]  Really?  Yeah, we can...  But you're leaving.  You know what I'm going to discuss with her, right?  Ass play?  Mm-hmm.  I mean, whatever.  Maybe she can walk you through it.  Nicole's walking by.  Nicole and Stan got into a big fight yesterday.  About what?  Off the air.  I don't know.  You don't even...  But I would bring them in, but you don't like them on the after show.  You shut up.  That was between me and you.  You don't think they're entertaining.  And I'll take your word for it.  I'm not criticizing that because you're a radio genius, but I take that to heart. 
[03:27:00]  You say they're no good, they're no good.  Who are you?  Me?  That was between me and you.  They suck on your show.  They do?  Yes.  He also said that about Bobo.  About Bobo?  Yeah, I told him no more Bobo for a while.  Have you seen Bobo's tweets to you?  No.  He said he wants an explanation and he doesn't think you're treating him fairly.  Good for him.  You don't give a shit, do you?  No.  Good for you.  That's a good attitude.  I don't fucking pay attention to him.  Good.  All right, guys.  I know we're doing nothing now, officially. 
[03:27:30]  It's all right.  People are entertained.  I'm almost packed up.  It's voyeuristic, the end of the show now.  By the way, I could do this.  Next week, we got Jim Florentine.  We got Penn Jillette.  We got Joel McHale.  We got Vinny, Uncle Nino, Paulie D, and Dina from the Jersey Shore.  Oh, my God.  A big week of guests.  Bob Kelly and Penn Jillette on Monday.  Oh, Bob Kelly?  Yes.  Why was he in a police uniform?  Anyone know?  He got an acting gig.  But what was it for?  Maybe Law and Order.  I'm just speculating.  I don't know.  Eric says Fat Cops.  Fat Cops? 
[03:28:00]  Is that real, Iraq?  No.  The show he made up is called Fat Cops.  It could be an R-rated movie with, I don't know, like fucking Seth Rogen or something.  That's not clever.  I think it's pretty clever.  Fat Cops?  Yeah.  That's describing what you see in the picture.  I can see that, though.  It's a movie they would make.  Fat Cops.  And who's his castmate?  Iraq.  Bob Kelly and Eric Nagel.  Fat Cops.  And Patrice booked a movie, I heard? 
[03:28:30]  Oh, that's fantastic.  Because he had to reschedule a Chicago gig.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we got to go, Jimmy?  All right.  I didn't even realize Jimmy left.  Are you going with us, Roland?  Time to go.  You're going, Roland?  Time for your shit show.  You're just walking out?  You're not going to, like, end the show?  Well, I'll tell you this, Opie.  You did a great job.  Roland, you coming up?  Yep.  Did a great job, too.  Yeah, Roland's walking.  You staying, Kenny, or?  No.  Wait for me.  Okay. 
[03:29:00]  I don't think Kenny's coming back.  You said he was.  Yeah, I think he was lying.  Why don't we go to a break and start the after show after this?  99 red balloons floating in the summer sky.  Panic bells, it's red alert.  There's something here from somewhere else.  The war machine springs to life.  Opens up one eager eye.  Focusing in on the sky.  Where 99 red balloons go by. 
[03:29:30]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, I'm not at that movie.  I'm right here with you on After Opie and Anthony Live.  My name is Sam Roberts.  They're all, uh, what movie are they seeing, Eric?  Um, you don't know? 
[03:30:00]  No, I had it.  It's okay if you don't know.  Hold on.  You don't have to.  We're free flowing here.  The show is over.  It was a great show today.  Unfortunately, Anthony was out sick.  Uh, hopefully he's feeling better now.  But Ant and Jim, I mean, uh, Opie and Jim made the most of, uh, of what they could do.  So, I was looking, uh, while the show was on.  What's your number?  What's your number?  I'm not going to give it to you on the air.  No, that's the name of the movie.  No! 
[03:30:30]  Um, I was looking, Eric, while the show was on at Fox News, like we do.  And Grace and Chance is playing on Fox News.  Hmm.  Is he coming on the show?  I don't believe so.  What?  Why?  Because, who are Grace and Chance?  It's a, it's a kid.  It's one guy.  His name is Grace and Chance.  Oh, I thought it was a duo.  I thought it was a duo.  No, Grace and Chance is that little 13-year-old kid who played, uh, the Lady Gaga song on the piano. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, then no, because no one cares.  Eric.  We had Loverboy in here.  Yes.  It's not our, we don't care whether or not people care.  We just want people in here.  I'll see what I can do.  Thank you.  That's all I want to hear.  Um, it was, uh, it turned into a very revealing show today.  Uh, I was, as much was said about me and whatever I do, I was kind of weirded out about Opie sleeping with socks on.  Eric, what do you sleep in again? 
[03:31:30]  Um, shorts and a t-shirt.  Socks?  No socks.  It's a weird thing, right?  No, my wife sleeps in socks, though.  She does?  All the time.  Was she molested?  No, she was not molested.  Well, we don't know for sure, unfortunately.  She just doesn't like walking around and, you know, uh, oh, she just doesn't like going to bed with her bare feet, so she wears socks.  Well, I mean, what's wrong with going to bed with bare feet? I don't understand.  I don't know.  Sometimes, I think it's more of a security kind of thing. 
[03:32:00]  You know, like some people have.  She wants to feel confined.  Okay.  Something like that.  Um, Eric, okay, here's the deal.  Yeah.  You know the new lights we set up?  Yeah.  Um.  You want to just turn those on only and the rest off?  No, I brought the people who do video for the web.  Yeah.  Here, to look at the lights to see what we needed and stuff.  Yeah.  Should we play a bit so we can look at the lights?  Uh, we could.  Or should we do, oh, you know what, we'll play real quick?  Let me play this real quick, and we'll do the lights, and then we'll be back here. 
[03:32:30]  This is what I've been wanting to play all week.  I don't have anything loaded here.  Hang on.  It's alright, I'll describe it.  It's the Anthony Pediatrics.  Anthony was out today.  He was sick, and, uh, we were talking about this earlier in the week.  Uh, Ant, and his affinity for young people.  Younger girlfriends.  Uh, he had to bring one.  His, his, a girlfriend, I don't know if it was his last girlfriend or a couple girlfriends  ago.  It was a, I believe it's a couple girlfriends ago.  She, uh, had a stomach ache or something, I don't know.  For whatever reason, he had to bring her to the hospital. 
[03:33:00]  Thank goodness she was alright.  But the key of the story here is that she had to go to the pediatrics unit.  He got to the hospital, he brought her in, and he had to, Anthony, from the Opie and Anthony  show, had to take his girlfriend to the pediatrics unit.  Uh, it's probably my favorite Anthony story of all time.  Just because, not only because it happened, but because he had the balls to come on the  air and tell the story.  Which not everybody would.  Think inside yourself. 
[03:33:30]  Would you have the balls to tell this story on a platform as wide as this?  Here it is.  Anthony takes his chick to the pediatrics unit on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  There's like, uh, you know, a girl over the house, you know.  You know how that goes, right?  And, um, apparently she has asthma.  Are you dating preemies at this point?  No.  Their lungs aren't fully developed?  No.  That's not.  No. 
[03:34:00]  No.  Do you have an incubator in your fucking compound?  No, I don't have an incubator.  No, no.  You're dating so young, their lungs aren't fully developed.  No, it's not like that.  Sorry.  It's just, it's asthma.  And it's just gotten, um, kind of worse over the past couple of days.  Well, that's not good.  So, you know, she hasn't been able to go back home.  Um, you know, she lives out of state.  She hasn't been able to go back home. 
[03:34:30]  Thailand?  No, not Thailand.  And, so, uh, last night, um, it was time to, I haven't gotten any sleep, by the way.  I'm, I'm exhausted.  I'm tripping over myself.  Uh, had to take her to the emergency room.  My favorite place to go.  What time?  To take her.  So, this was about 1.30 in the morning.  Were you asleep?  No. 
[03:35:00]  No, I was still awake because, you know, the asthma and stuff like that and things, you know,  it's just one of those things.  So, it was time to, you know, go to the emergency room.  How far do you live from the hospital?  Uh, it's not far.  Okay.  It's a few weeks.  It's not bad.  Um, so, we go there and, uh, you know, you'd go through all that paperwork stuff that, you  know, she's going through all the paperwork and everything like that.  It takes forever.  And then, you know.  Is she going through the, uh, because this fucking frustrates the shit out of me.  Yeah.  Is she filling out her paperwork as she's gasping for air? 
[03:35:30]  Well, she's not gasping for air.  Because the emergency room is, is wonderful when it comes to that.  Make sure the paperwork is done before we even acknowledge that you're dying right in  front of our eyes.  I know.  It really is horrible.  When I had the worst allergy attack of my life where I really thought I was, like, minutes  from dying, they had to make sure I had all my fucking paperwork.  I had a pounding headache.  My headache was so bad.  Sorry, Anthony.  But it drives me fucking nuts.  I couldn't even see the form anymore.  That's how bad I was.  And I'm like, will you just take care of this and then we'll worry about the stupid paperwork. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, they want to know your fucking.  They need the paperwork immediately.  They want to know they're getting paid, motherfucker.  Sorry.  It's one of my fucking pet peeves in this world.  The stupid emergency room and their dumb paperwork first.  Filling out the paperwork.  I'm sorry.  I'll shut up.  No, no.  They're filling out the paperwork.  And then it's time to, you know, go into the emergency room portion of the hospital.  Now, I've dealt with that before in the past.  Um, but, uh, this was a little embarrassing. 
[03:36:30]  They, they took her into pediatrics.  Oh, my God.  Do you know there's a whole nother emergency room for pediatrics?  Oh, my God.  And they brought her in there and, um, there's, I can't even look at you.  There's little paintings on the walls and, and paper, like, like ducks and stuff all over 
[03:37:00]  the place.  I can't even look at you.  And there's little kids walking around and a baby was crying and, and, and, and she's  in pediatrics and, and the doctor asked me, like, you know, oh, okay, who are you?  And I'm just like, a friend.  I'm a friend.  I was, I've never felt like the creep that I know I am, but I've never actually felt it.  Who are you?  A friend.  A friend.  I'm a friend. 
[03:37:30]  I'm a friend.  I've never even seen that part of a hospital.  And I'm sitting in this little chair.  Right.  And I'm looking at, like, a child's rights in the hospital.  And, and it says things like, please tell me if it's going to hurt.  I'll be okay with it.  And, uh, please, um, um, uh, give me a hug.  I could use it.  Let me take my toy wherever I'm going in the hospital. 
[03:38:00]  I'm reading signs like this and looking at paper fucking mobiles of ducks and geese.  All right.  You know, you, you brought this to the show.  I know.  You just threw yourself under the bus.  It was so embarrassing.  Eric and Virginia Tech.  Wow.  A pediatric and a geriatric.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, pediatric.  And I noticed there was, like, there was a, a cabinet with, with games in it.  All kinds of games.  Oh.  I'm in the fucking pediatric ward. 
[03:38:30]  And, and, you know, uh, the, the, the girl there, she's, she's tall.  And her feet were hanging off at the end of the friggin' pediatric bed.  I felt so bad.  Just because.  And I felt like such a ghoul.  Just because.  Just because they're tall doesn't make it okay, Anthony.  No, no.  I, I understand.  I understand.  Did you take advantage of the situation and get some speed dating in while they were, while  they were running her through the tests? 
[03:39:00]  There was, there was one girl that got up and she's holding the back of her gown shut  and she had to be about 16 or 17 to go give a urine sample.  She was pretty cute.  Yeah.  I must say.  But, you know, I, I, I, I put my head down the whole time.  I just felt like.  Were you ashamed and embarrassed?  Dude.  I was completely ashamed and embarrassed.  You were a celebrity.  Yeah.  Finally you were ashamed.  I, I, it, it finally took.  It's not bad for you to have a little shame finally.  To go to the emergency room.  Yeah. 
[03:39:30]  And have, uh, a, a girl that's been, you know, staying at the house because she's,  she's sick, uh, and, and can't, you know, can't make it back home in that state with  the, uh, the, uh, the as-bots.  After O&A.  Oh, we're back on the air.  You can keep going.  Keep talking.  It doesn't matter.  We're trying to, it's after Opie and Anthony live and we're trying to figure out the lighting  in the studio.  Opie and Anthony obviously, uh, had issues with it earlier in the week and, uh, we're  trying to actually achieve a conclusion that everybody will be satisfied with and figuring 
[03:40:00]  out how are, how are they looking right now?  Makes for great radio.  They are, uh, a little blinding from this perspective.  Like, I'm definitely sort of seeing colors and, and, and things like that.  What was the issue?  They, they felt there were too many shadows.  Yeah, they said they felt there were too many shadows and they, I mean, they said they  were too bright and they didn't, they, and then they said we needed a third one.  Uh, so I don't know if positioning, but they also, like, we haven't actually filmed anything 
[03:40:30]  with the lights on yet.  So, you know, it remains to be seen, I guess.  But this, uh, expedition was to make sure that we don't need a third one, unless you  think we might.  And, uh, we're talking to some of the, uh, videographers and photographers from the web  team, obviously, who, who have more experience with this than the rest of us.  It's what they do for a living.  What I do for a living is this.  I just turn mics on, no matter what's going on in the studio and try to make something 
[03:41:00]  out of it.  What they do is figure out the best scene.  Troy, this is good, right?  Yeah, this is great radio.  This is awesome.  Yeah.  Nothing makes radio good like light, cutting the light.  Yeah.  I mean, we're trying, well, we're going to reach the, they're working through the bugs.  You know what I mean?  And that's what the fans want to hear.  We're behind the scenes right now.  This light's going to have to move over, pointing more towards him.  Like, just move it like on the twisty thing or actually take it off and move it?  The twisty thing.  Okay.  So, to the left.  Okay.  So, we're going to move that a little. 
[03:41:30]  But I just think, imagine that light in your face for four hours.  Well, we're not going to leave them.  We're not, we can't leave these lights on all the time.  We'll have to just put them on when we're filming for guests or whatever.  They are blinding if you look into them.  Well, yeah, I know.  They're pointing at me.  Yeah.  I mean, I-  Because I looked into that one for a second and there's, you know, you see lights over here.  Yeah.  I think, I'm worried that we're going to end up in a position where we have those two  lights that are expensive, hung up in the studio.  They're going to be off all the time.  And we're just going to do what we were doing before.  Yeah. 
[03:42:00]  You know?  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  Yeah.  So, you think we just kind of position-  Now, do you think this is the setup we should have?  Like, maybe dim those a little and the spotlight should be dimmed?  I think the spotlight should be dimmed.  At this point, I think the lights of the spotlight's okay.  Okay.  So, like, right around here and then bring those, the harshness of these down a little  bit.  And point this one a little bit towards Ant.  Towards Ant.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  But you don't think we need, like, a third one to cancel anything out? 
[03:42:30]  It seems like a lot of light for, like, a radio studio.  You know?  Yeah.  I mean, Troy, you filmed a professional music video.  Yeah.  Multiple.  Do you have the lighting light?  It's a lot.  Well, it's a lot of lighting.  I mean, but you have to, it's just the way it goes, you know, when you're, but it's  also shooting, like, with a lot of lighting is a lot different from actually just trying  to have a conversation on the air with blinding lights on you the whole time.  So, you know, you're just doing what you're supposed to be doing.  Yeah.  And you're looking at the light for, like, four hours, hopefully.  Yeah.  I don't know much about lighting, but you think you could just put, like, a gel on it to soften 
[03:43:00]  it out and spread out the light a bit.  If you want to get a gel that's similar to these spotlights, it's best to have a consistent  lighting color.  Okay.  So you think that we should get...  We have a yellowish and a white.  Right.  So you think maybe if we get a gel that's closer to the color of the spotlights, everything  evens out nice.  There's not lights clashing.  Right.  All right.  Well, you guys have been a big help.  I mean, I know for me and for the audience, the audience at home, let me tell you, all week 
[03:43:30]  have been trying to figure out what are they going to do about these lights.  It's true.  Oh, yeah.  I know that.  They have, because I put myself in the perspective of a fan.  And say, I would be wondering what they're going to do with the lights.  Now we know, folks, what we're going to try to do is put gels over the video lights, the  big ones that Opie and Anthony have been talking about, that match the lights that were already  here, the smaller ones, and then we'll be able to flood the room a little more with consistent  lighting.  Is that right? 
[03:44:00]  Well, thank you.  Does he have his own studio in his basement, though?  I mean, he knows what sort of...  Yeah, but he has his own studio in his basement, but he's gone from this studio before we have  the opportunity to ask him any questions.  No, I'm saying, but like, he, I would think he would have a suggestion to make since he's  put money into building something or anything.  Yeah, but he wants to just kind of go home.  So like, you know, he wouldn't want to stay here.  Like, Troy, you know what I'm saying.  Like, he doesn't want to...  Ant doesn't want to stay here and make suggestions when he could be driving home.  I think Ant's sort of like, hey, you guys, this is a big company. 
[03:44:30]  You guys are smart guys.  Figure it out.  You guys got this.  You guys figure it out.  I'm headed back to L.I.  This is my shit?  This is my shit?  I'll worry about my shit?  Yeah.  You worry about your shit?  I'm actually going to go home and work on my studio.  You work on this one.  Yeah.  And we'll meet somewhere in the middle.  Fair enough.  That's kind of his perspective.  And it is funny because he does have a really nice setup over there.  Well, I've only seen...  Oh, yeah.  I mean, have you seen the TwitPix?  It looks amazing.  Mm-hmm.  Let me see.  Steve, you're on after O.B. and Anthony Live. 
[03:45:00]  Hey, Sam.  I told you they care.  They're calling in to talk about the lighting.  And just go ahead.  Take your ass down to B&H and go get some good lights that are appropriate for that.  They've got these lights that almost look like fluorescent lights, but they're perfect  for this instead of those goddamn huge things that you've got sticking up there.  Well, what's the difference?  These kind of look like fluorescent lights to me.  You mean...  These are the square lights.  Huh?  They're cute.  They'll figure it out. 
[03:45:30]  All right.  Well, I mean, again, I'm not going to go to B&H because...  It's not your job.  Sam Roberts is not going light shopping.  I think they probably went...  I'm just going to take a guess.  Whoever decided on these lights in here went with these because they use them in the other  studio for Howard's show.  And I guess it looks good.  Oh, this looks cool in here now.  Yeah, now we're talking.  Yeah.  We need to have black lights.  Yeah, we're going to get some black lights in here.  Put on some Floyds, some weed, smoke some weed.  No, we got to get you on the ones and twos.  That's right.  A strobe going or something.  Let's have a party in here.  Why not?  That'd be fun. 
[03:46:00]  Can you play the My Strange Addiction bit?  I don't have it next to me.  All right.  So we figured it out.  All right.  Right?  Probably.  Okay.  You're in a much better situation now with these two lights.  You think so?  Yeah.  Definitely.  Are you guys going to...  Because every now and then you guys stop by and video stuff.  Are you guys...  You can buy whenever you guys ask.  Yeah.  Are you going to be...  Rob calls me if we're available on that show?  You're here.  Are you guys going to be happy you're videoing in here with these great lights?  Be like, yeah, look what I came out with.  We always enjoy working with you guys. 
[03:46:30]  Fantastic.  Oh my gosh.  Well, I appreciate...  Who's your best guest next week?  We got a whole bunch of Jersey Shore people.  Oh, Pendulette and Joel McHale.  He's going to be in here.  Joel McHale would be pretty funny.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll try...  But...  Yeah, but that's a risk too.  Because we're going to have to put these lights on some trial runs next week.  So hopefully some of the...  The show chicks are at least darker.  So it might be a better time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hopefully we'll do some of the shittier guests first.  And that way it doesn't really matter what the video looks like. 
[03:47:00]  You know what I mean?  I followed Snooki around for a while yesterday.  So I've had enough of her.  Yeah.  You're not into Snooki?  I've never seen the show.  Why not?  Nine million people have.  I live in New Jersey.  I went to college in Long Island.  I kind of know the story.  You're done with it.  I've seen it.  Troy, are you watching Jersey Shore?  No.  No.  I checked out a long time ago.  Do you even...  You used to watch it?  What's that?  You used to watch it?  I mean, I tried when there was the buzz going for it.  First season.  But I just don't care.  You don't even have a TV, do you?  No, I have a TV.  It's just not hooked up to cable.  So what do you have it for? 
[03:47:30]  Because I can watch DVDs on it.  Oh.  And eventually I'm going to get my computer hooked up to it.  I just need to go get the wire.  I gotcha.  High definition?  Yeah.  But you don't have cable?  No.  I mean, I'll put it on probably...  Probably because last winter I turned it on the winter because there's nothing to do.  But I turn it off this summer because I'm never home.  Eric, can you relate?  All right.  See you guys later.  All right.  Thank you so much for stopping by.  Thank you.  You're a big help.  Later, man.  We got the lighting figured out.  Eric, you in there?  I don't know what he's doing.  Let me screen call it.  I don't know where he is.  Oh, there he is. 
[03:48:00]  Rob.  Hang on a second, Rob.  Hello.  What's Rob doing?  You wrote that I had...  Oh, tell him he's on the air.  Which doesn't mention Mark Maris.  Tell him he's on the air.  Don't just air his phone call.  Let me call you back, all right?  You better tell him he's on the air when you do stuff like that, dude.  Yeah, don't just turn the mic on.  I'm yelling at you to tell him he's on the air.  He's your boss, Eric.  Eh, whatever.  Did you hear what Troy said?  No.  What happened?  He said that he doesn't watch cable and he only turns on his TV in the winter because 
[03:48:30]  there's nothing else to do.  Is that something you can relate to?  Not at all.  Troy, yeah, he told me the other day and he goes, you know, I don't have TV.  I said, I thought you turned it back on.  Yeah, I had it on for a little bit.  Then I turned it off again.  I just don't like it.  I'm bored.  I get bored.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Those lighting people, they didn't know what was going on when I turned these mics on.  I can't even see into the studio.  Yeah.  Because one, the two panes of glass here were refracting it, but also I see handprints  and smear all over the thing. 
[03:49:00]  I can't, I can't really even see into there.  Maybe you kept Joe's greasy palms of yours, aren't you?  No, it's other side.  Oh.  Yeah, it's from this side.  It's your side.  Well, I didn't touch the glass.  Well, it's a big mess.  Well, whatever.  If I knew that I was going to hear we need to get gels on the lights 400 times on the  Opie and Anthony show over the course of two weeks, I guess we're going to get some  different gels.  I mean.  It makes sense.  I don't know.  I think Anthony actually had suggested that, I believe.  In the beginning.  Months ago. 
[03:49:30]  Well, I mean, there are, there is a gel on that light, but it doesn't, I mean, it doesn't  match the lighting.  No, but you know what I'm talking about.  Like, it just softens everything.  It spreads out the light and softens it.  Yeah.  It's being so harsh.  I think the idea is for those lights to match these lights, the smaller ones, as closely  as humanly possible.  And that would flood the studio with proper lighting.  It's consistent.  Right.  Makes sense.  How does it feel being back on the phones?  It's fine.  You liked it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you get a little break. 
[03:50:00]  You were on the air today, much more open sexually than I was.  Now, I did want to clear that up a little bit because it's not that I'm not a sexual  person, but around like my pals or the people I work with, that's just not there for me.  That element isn't, isn't there.  It exists.  I think you're a sexual person as far as you enjoy sex with women.  Women.  Sure.  Um, I don't really think that you're a very, um, you're not just real, uh, you don't 
[03:50:30]  seem like a sexually adventurous kind of guy.  Like, uh, like, uh, you know, just trying weird shit out and, and just seeing what sticks.  Yeah.  Like, it just seems like you're just, this is sex.  This is what it is.  And, and, and that's fine.  I mean, you don't, there's no, you know, just because some people are a little bit more  sexually perverted doesn't mean that you have to be there as well.  So you think I'm a romantic?  I just don't think sex is one of the most important things in your life. 
[03:51:00]  That's fair.  Yeah.  That's fair.  Yeah.  I got a lot going on, Troy.  And honestly, you know, I don't want to talk about Jess sexually, but she doesn't seem  like a pig that would be into like weird shit.  She's certainly not.  She's not a little pig.  She seems a little more straightforward.  Yes.  If you don't mind me saying that.  I don't mind you saying it.  I'm sure that she would not mind you saying that because you're not speaking out of turn.  Right.  Um, but you've been with some pigs.  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, you've had your experiences.  Sure.  Well, look, I was in a band. 
[03:51:30]  I played in a band for, for many years.  And at that point, you know, it's more about just quantity over quality.  Yeah.  Did you hear, uh, Pips, the Ron and Fez intern yesterday talking about, cause we had, uh,  the Russian dolls.  Yeah, no, I heard.  I was listening, which if you saw their show last night was unbelievable.  Yeah.  I didn't, I didn't see it, but.  He had a story about, I guess, a Russian girl that he was dating.  If I remember correctly, uh, wanted to bend, wanted him to bend her out the window. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah.  And have sex with her from behind while she was hanging out the window.  How high up was the window, Pips?  It was in an apartment building.  So we were on like, I think we were on the fifth floor.  Okay.  So five stories up, hanging out the window, getting nailed from behind.  I, I can't stand Russian.  I know that's such a mean thing to say, and they are pretty, you know, but that accent just  drives me to the wall.  You don't like it.  No, I tried dating a Russian girl and it was, it was, uh, I don't know.  A little while ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it was within the past year, but, um, she was just fucking nuts, man. 
[03:52:30]  And basically she, I knew that she was trying to find a guy to, because she wanted to get  married to stay in the country.  And she was very, very, very, she was like, come over, I'm going to cook you dinner, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, uh, funny story.  Um, I hope it's funny.  Cause you just set it up to be funny.  I shouldn't have said, I hate, I shouldn't have said that.  But, uh, this girl asked me to go to Ikea with her and she, a Russian girl at Ikea.  Well, because she needed a couple of things for her apartment and she needed me to help 
[03:53:00]  build them and carry them back.  Now, when I talked to the Russians yesterday, uh, Boris told me they were into very chic  things.  Yeah.  Chic cars, chic clothes.  Well, this girl made a lot of money.  She was in finance banking or something like that, but she, you know, she needed like a,  um, a dresser or something, something from Ikea.  Sure.  So, uh, she asked me to go and I'm sitting there waiting for her at, at a Starbucks cause  we were going to get on the train together.  And, uh, my friend Ari, who actually works here over on the, the jam band channel, uh, 
[03:53:30]  we were going to get together.  Jam band channel.  Yeah.  And, um, uh, I thought I was texting him back and I said, this fucking dumb bitch is running  late.  I don't want to go to Ikea.  Oh no.  Fuck her.  This sucks.  I typed all this shit out.  Yeah.  I sent it and I accidentally sent it to her.  How, when did you realize that you had sent it to her?  Do you have an iPhone?  I have an iPhone.  And as the little bar was going across, I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  And if I had a BlackBerry, I would have just quick popped the battery out, but you can't 
[03:54:00]  force shut this down real quick.  And, uh, it sucks.  I've done actually done that a couple of times, but the funny, funny part about the whole  thing is she got this and I just played it off like what?  I was just kidding around.  Yeah.  I knew it was you.  And, and I ended up fucking her that night.  Congratulations.  Way to go, buddy.  I'm getting accused.  One of the infamous Stengel brothers is texting me, calling me a man whore very aggressively.  A man whore?  A man whore.  Why is that?  He doesn't, he doesn't believe the things that I'm saying. 
[03:54:30]  Oh.  But.  Yeah, I do.  You do.  You don't think I'm a man whore, do you?  No.  Now, how many women have you been with?  No more than you could count on two hands for sure.  So under 10?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, definitely under 10.  I mean, that's fine.  Exactly.  Look, I'm, I'm a business minded person, okay?  Stengel.  I don't need to be dipping it wherever I go.  Yeah.  Troy, on the other hand.  No, I, I.  He likes to, he likes to get it in.  No, well, I do, I do.  Eric, Eric, you tell me this. 
[03:55:00]  You've known Troy for a long time, Eric Nagel.  Does he like to get it in quite a bit?  He's not listening.  He's not even, he's not even, he's got his feet up.  I hear you.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I was talking with Pepper.  Tell him to come on the show.  He's always welcome.  You want to come in?  No, no, no.  Eric, just answer the question.  I'm trying to have a conversation.  Did you hear?  Eric drove me crazy.  He drove me absolutely insane because I was trying to have a conversation with him about Guy  Fieri screaming, you were here.  And, and he twists the entire conversation to say, well, nobody can be allergic to alcohol. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  And I'm like, I'm trying to have a conversation about something with you and you come up and  now he's not even listening.  Nevermind, Aaron, whatever.  Nevermind.  I'll talk to you.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  No, I've actually come down a lot from, from when I was.  But you still like to get it in.  Eric.  I mean, I'm a, I'm a heterosexual man.  You knew Troy back in the day.  Yeah.  He likes to get it in.  Troy can be very wild.  Yeah.  It's wild.  That was very, very wild.  It was very homoerotic the way he said that.  It was very like, I know from experience type of way that Eric just said that. 
[03:56:00]  Have you been intimate with Troy?  Have I?  No.  Like on any level.  Like I'm not saying full out anal sex, but even anywhere from first to third base.  No, not at all.  The closest that I've come to being sexual with Eric Nagel is I got a blow job in his parents'  bathroom.  Eric, did your dad listen?  I know your dad listens to ONA.  Does he listen to the after show?  Sorry, Mr. Nagel. 
[03:56:30]  That was years ago.  Don't worry about it now.  They probably don't even have the same bathroom anymore.  Have they moved?  No, they moved, right?  Yeah.  So it's a big deal.  That was years ago.  Bygones be bygones.  Did Eric know you were getting a Hummer in his bathroom?  No.  No, everybody had passed out and just a couple of us stayed up and partied.  What was going on in Eric's house?  Oh.  What was going on?  You can talk invaderies if you want.  We can talk about it.  We used to have a lot of parties.  Yeah.  In Eric's house?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, tell me, this is how I'm seeing this in my head. 
[03:57:00]  As like, the cool kids in the band come and they find dumb, innocent Eric Nagel and they  take advantage of him and they kind of just push him around and use his house as a party  pad and get blowjobs in his parents' bathroom.  Well, I don't know about that.  I mean, I think Eric was partying as well.  I don't even think you were.  Yeah, there was.  Yeah, he was.  But did you take advantage of him?  Well, yeah, of course.  I think it was more the way I set it up, but go ahead.  The one guy that was with us, Eric had a cantaloupe sitting there and he carved a hole in it and 
[03:57:30]  he fucked it and then he threw it into Eric's hot tub along with pizza boxes and beer bottles  and everything else.  Well, the beer bottles too, because the next morning as we're stumbling, like in the kitchen  has this huge bay window looking out to, we had like a big backyard and there's green  light is just coming into the kitchen and we're trying to figure out where the fuck  this green light's coming from.  Throughout the night, people were just hucking Heineken bottles from the hot tub into this  tree, so they were just branched in there so all the light was reflecting into the beer 
[03:58:00]  bottles, turning everything green.  Now, Troy, Eric was the kid whose house you went to to trash at parties.  No.  Well, in his defense, we would trash everybody's house.  Did anybody trash your house?  Well, I had parties that got out of hand.  At your parents' house?  No, no, no, no.  I mean, that is an apartment.  That's fucking stupid.  You didn't disrespect your parents?  No.  Fuck no.  Troy had a really awesome apartment because there was barely anything in it but two couches  and a hot tub.  We had a hot tub in our living room.  That sounds about right, yeah. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, but so you had a party house, so it was okay to trash it.  You, instead of going to somebody's party house, you went to Eric's parents' house and  trashed it.  Yeah, well, we just looked at it like, look, there's a party.  Let's have fun.  Don't stand in our way of having fun.  It wasn't really trashed.  You just said there were pizza boxes, fucked cantaloupes, and beer bottles in your hot tub.  But it's chlorine.  You scoop it out, you refilter, and let it go.  No, you don't let it go.  What did your parents say?  They don't know.  Well, they know now, but...  Were you able to clean it up before they got home?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:59:00]  My parents used to just take off.  Like, for the summer, they'd go away for like a month.  Eric was a lot of fun.  Eric didn't, at that time, didn't give a fuck.  Oh, and this was when, because he just said, when he was the sex bagel, he used to fuck  around and take condoms out of the garbage.  Which, by the way, somebody tweeted me and said that taking a condom out of the garbage  was something they did in the movie Bad Teacher.  No, no, no, no, no.  They think Eric took that.  The one...  Fucking bad...  I never saw...  That's that shitty movie you saw.  I know.  Somebody tweeted it to me.  I'm not accusing you.  No, no.  This is years ago when that one girl was a little crazy. 
[03:59:30]  It's funny to think that somebody would...  He would take his ejaculated-in condom and squirt it back into her vagina.  It's just strange.  We'll have to get into all this.  The weekend's about to start.  Yeah.  And I need to start my weekend.  So I'll let you start yours.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.
