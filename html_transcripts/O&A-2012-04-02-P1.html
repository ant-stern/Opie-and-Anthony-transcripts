<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the Mega Millions lottery, focusing on a McDonald's employee's alleged winning ticket and the ensuing speculation about potential fraud and the complexities of group lottery purchases.  The hosts then recounted and mocked E-Rock's disastrous WrestleMania experience, detailing his sunburn, camera malfunction, poor seating, lack of food, and missed Mike Tyson autograph signing.  This segued into a discussion of past New York lottery winners, Curtis Sharp and Lou Eisenberg, and their contrasting post-win fates. The segment concluded with a brief recap of WrestleMania results, specifically The Rock's victory and CM Punk's championship win.

The show then moved on to listener stories, starting with "J-Dubs," known for taking photos with radio personalities.  This transitioned into a detailed and humorous recounting of Sam Roberts' bachelor party, including a visit to Jim Norton's comedy show and a gentlemen's club, complete with anecdotes about lap dances, the discomfort of one guest, and the unexpected participation of several fathers. The hosts then criticized the New York Knicks for their allegedly deceptive handling of Jeremy Lin's injury, calling it a "dick move" to their fans.  They followed this with a condemnation of NBC's allegedly biased editing of the Trayvon Martin 911 call, contrasting it with their own experiences facing criticism, and included a call from Jay Moore, notable for his use of AAVE.  The segment ended with a discussion of *Game of Thrones* and the upcoming appearance of Bill Burr.

Jay Moore's call dominated a significant portion of the show.  He lamented his podcast's iTunes ranking compared to T.J. Miller, leading to a comedic rant about the perceived coolness of nerds.  The conversation shifted to Matt Paxton, a hoarder-themed reality TV personality, and then back to the Knicks and Jeremy Lin's injury, incorporating Moore's perspective and opinions on other sports personalities and teams, including the Islanders and Doug Waite.  A large part of the segment involved criticizing T.J. Miller's negative blog post about Dane Cook,  detailing Miller's allegedly misogynistic criticisms.  A heated debate with a caller, Jay, ensued concerning the media's portrayal of the Trayvon Martin shooting and the editing of the 911 call, resulting in a contentious exchange of accusations and insults about race and media bias. The show concluded this segment with additional examples of media audio manipulation, including a clip of a child wanting to be a police officer.

A phone call with E-Rock provided further details about his WrestleMania woes, including poor visibility, long lines, and shortages of food, water, and beer.  The hosts relentlessly teased him about his sunburn and his attempts to sneak in ice cream, and a picture of E-Rock with "Mr. Cowhead" showcasing his sunburn was displayed.  The show then played a profanity-laced voicemail allegedly left by Chevy Chase for Dan Harmon after Chase reportedly walked off the *Community* set, sparking a discussion about its authenticity as either genuine or a publicity stunt.

Bill Burr then joined the show in studio. He shared anecdotes about hecklers from his stand-up career, including a discussion of an infamous blurry YouTube video from Philly.  The conversation touched upon his podcast, upcoming performances at Caroline's, his purchase of a firearm for home security, and a caller's similar experience with hecklers at a Rich Vos and Bonnie McFarlane show.  The economic system and gold standard were also briefly discussed.  A further segment with Burr included discussions about hecklers in comedy, comparing his experiences to others, and a discussion of funny tweets from Colin Quinn.  Burr detailed his car being repeatedly vandalized, leading to a discussion about petty crime.  A significant portion focused on his love for the Flyers, dislike of Penguins fans, and newfound appreciation for Sidney Crosby.  He shared humorous anecdotes about his recent foray into ice hockey, and the conversation covered various hockey teams and players, including the Rangers, Bruins, and Islanders, concluding with a brief discussion about the Islanders' potential relocation and a mention of Opie's new girlfriend.  A recurring joke about Burr's difficulty reaching the show's hotline also featured throughout the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Obviously, none of us won the Mega Millions because we're here today.  I say that because I watch a lot of Sunday morning news programs.  Sunday morning.  Was it Sunday?  Yeah, those are when those days were.  No, I mean, that's when we knew the Mega Millions.  Yeah.  I guess it was Sunday.  It was Saturday.  All right, so then it was Saturday morning and Sunday morning.  All the local news programs and then the national news programs, they were all using the same joke. 
[00:00:30]  Obviously, we didn't win because we're here today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess some woman is claiming she won in Baltimore.  And there's a whole big fucking to-do.  Well, there's always a to-do.  Remember when Jim Norton was thinking about buying these tickets last week?  I did.  We walked him through it because he's like, oh, I'm just going to get an intern and buy my tickets or whatever. 
[00:01:00]  I'm like, you can't do that because this shit happens all the time.  Exactly.  They're going to claim ownership of a ticket.  So what's the story?  This lady is claiming ownership.  She's claiming she has the winning ticket.  Now, that's even debatable because she hasn't shown it to anybody.  And she's kind of backtracking, but it might be for the plain fact that she has the ticket and doesn't want to kind of let it out.  Well, she works at McDonald's.  There's 15 other employees that she works with that she went in on for tickets. 
[00:01:30]  So they bought some tickets and they locked them up in the safe at the McDonald's.  But then later on in the day, later on, never, that's when he doesn't even realize how he delivered that line perfectly.  He's fucking hilarious.  He's a comedic genius.  They gave her a little more money to go get more tickets, which she then took home with her, those tickets.  Right.  And apparently one of those tickets was a winning ticket. 
[00:02:00]  Damn.  That's what she's claiming.  But she's saying, yeah, I had the ones that I bought with the money from McDonald's, but the winning ticket was the one I bought with my money, motherfucker.  Why would she tell anybody?  You have to.  It becomes public, I guess.  No, some of these states, you could be anonymous.  Never.  Oh, you think they would know?  You never have to tell anyone.  If she just quit her job and then they started driving by in a Rolls Royce? 
[00:02:30]  Let me have a Big Mac, sucker motherfucker.  You learned shit.  I learned about lottery shit.  I don't care, but I mean, when the prize was, what, $640 million or something like that?  Yeah.  Supposedly some of these states, you could be anonymous.  Yeah.  You never stepped forward.  But Illinois, it's right on the ticket.  If you do win, you have to make a public appearance.  See, I learned crap.  Yeah.  But maybe Baltimore is the...  Maryland?  Well, she went in on tickets with co-workers, 15 of them, and they have the names in a safe. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  So that looks bad, like, when you have a bunch of people and you go in together.  Yeah.  And then the manager, those tickets are in the safe.  Gives me a smile, because he knows that it's me they've been coming to see.  That's right.  Yeah.  To forget that joke for a while.  Look, I know you want to beat the shit out of this lady.  Yeah.  And I understand.  I understand how you want to beat the shit out of this lady.  Uh-huh.  We would all do the same fucking thing.  Just fuck everyone over.  You got to figure it's $105 million, right?  Right.  And that's for her, $105 million. 
[00:03:30]  And she has, like, seven kids.  And, yeah, of course, she's unmarried with seven children, too, by the way.  And then she has to split it with 15 other people.  Right.  That brings you $105 million down quite a bit.  And I think the $105 million is free tax.  $105 million, by the way, that would bring you down to, like, $7 million, if I'm doing  my math quickly here.  And then you got to go with the whole taxes and all that shit.  You get maybe $4 million out of it.  But then the lump sum.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, no, that's after lump sum.  Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  It's really just.  It's easy to beat her up.  But if you're the dude going to get the tickets and all of a sudden you see you got one of  the winning ones, you're going to try to make some shit up.  Look, if you fucking.  Because you don't care about your coworkers that much.  If you decide you're going to be the person that goes down and buys the tickets for everybody,  you're pretty much forfeiting your right to buy your own tickets at that point.  Because you can't distinguish unless you give them to somebody else.  Unless they're in the safe.  Unless you put all the tickets that you bought for the group. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, 15 of us are in.  Here's 15 tickets in your safe.  Yeah, and now I have my own.  Everyone goes and buys their own, too.  Fair enough.  You can't just go through it.  You think she went through her tickets and looked through all the workers' ones and went,  well, those are all losers.  Oh, here's my winning one.  Or do you think she actually saw the winning one in that stack?  Well, you got to think.  I mean, McDonald's, a lot of reputable people work at McDonald's.  Oh, yes.  All these people are very trustworthy.  McDonald's.  McDonald's.  McDonald's.  I works at McDonald's. 
[00:05:00]  I don't blame her.  What?  Think of past jobs.  Do you hang out with any of those coworkers?  Well, I know one person that wouldn't blame her.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  He's fucked over people on the lottery.  Oh, boy, has he.  See, we had a situation right here in our office.  Yes.  E-Rock fucking.  E-Rock won $100,000.  $100,000.  Because the local lottery fucked up.  It was, what, a newspaper lottery or something?  Yeah, it was like a daily news, right?  They were doing one of those, you know, pick a number things.  And they do it to up their subscribership, I guess. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And he won.  But there was a misprint.  But then a bunch of people won.  They realized, oh, there's a fuck-up here.  There's a misprint.  There was a fuck-up.  So then it was a lawsuit and all that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Because they only wanted, what, one winner?  And they ended up with, like, a...  I had thousands, I think.  Was it thousands?  It was crazy.  How many winners were there?  Yeah, thousands.  Thousands.  It was a misprint.  So they decided, okay, everybody that supposedly won, send us your ticket.  It'll go in a hat, a wacky hat or something, one of those big cages that you spin. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  And we'll pick out a winner or a couple of winners, I think.  A few winners, right.  And E-Rock was one of those people that won $100,000.  But the argument is, you know, he got his numbers from the newspaper.  Yeah, yeah.  The radio show's newspaper.  We've never jumped in on this.  Right, right, right.  The guys are fucking pissed to this day.  But technically, we should have got our share as well.  Oh, it was community.  It was a community entry.  It was a community newspaper.  Newspaper.  And we're like, oh, we all won.  And then we realized, oh, no, there's a misprint. 
[00:06:30]  And then E-Rock, you know, he's the one that pocketed it.  And he ended up buying a condo with the money and everything, which makes it hurt even more.  It's crazy.  And then he gave, what, the condo away?  He's done with it.  Yeah.  Did he sell it?  Now it's Castle Nagel.  No, remember we asked him about the condo.  And he said, no, it's somebody else's now.  And we were like, he's like, I don't have it anymore.  And we were like, did you sell it?  And he's like, no.  Oh, he kept it in the family.  He just gave it away, though.  He doesn't need it.  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  E-Rock. 
[00:07:00]  He claims, if you ask him, that it was a Sunday newspaper.  He bought it.  Right.  But I've never known E-Rock to buy any newspapers.  No.  No, he'd probably go to the bathroom on them.  Yeah.  He didn't buy the newspaper.  Or he'd fish off them.  Big fatso.  But see, that's what I'm saying.  Everyone tries to come up with a story.  And I don't blame any of them.  Well.  Be mad at E-Rock all you want.  But there's a lot of people that would have done the same thing.  Well, here lies the difference, though.  E-Rock was not brutally murdered by the co-workers. 
[00:07:30]  This woman, there's a good chance she might be.  Well, the boss said the manager.  Goldie Moore.  The manager had sent her for another ticket.  Like, they had the ones locked up.  And he gave her $5 more to go buy more.  Right.  And it's like, fuck.  That does take away your...  We're missing the obvious, though.  Why...  How hard is it to buy lottery tickets that you have to...  Send other people.  Send other people.  Buy your own ticket!  Exactly.  Just don't fucking have to...  You have to worry about too much when that happens.  The whole group thing is... 
[00:08:00]  That idea, anyway.  That's so dumb.  What do they do?  They pool their money together and they go,  All right, Margie.  All right.  Go get the tickets for this week.  Yes, we're checking the tickets.  Everyone here in personnel put together their money.  We pooled our money.  Yeah.  When you could just, at launch, go buy a ticket.  Go buy a ticket.  Like, why would you do that?  Fuck a buck.  Because this happens every time.  All the time.  So what have we got?  Three winners?  Three winners.  Yeah.  It might be this woman.  It might not be. 
[00:08:30]  And then another one from Kansas?  Another one from Illinois?  Illinois.  The Illinois person has to come forward.  They have to.  Yeah?  Yeah, they have to.  It's part of the deal.  And, all right.  Well, let's see how this plays out.  They said over a billion tickets were sold.  Wow.  Over a billion tickets.  And they said if they didn't have a winner, the prize would have been over a billion.  Yeah.  Over a billion.  That would have been fucking cool.  But at that point, there's so many people playing.  The odds that no one's going to win, I think, is less than someone winning. 
[00:09:00]  But think about it.  Over a billion tickets sold, they only got three winners.  I know.  That's amazing.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Why would you play this thing?  It's crazy.  I know.  Because somebody's got to hit it.  It's true.  It's just.  I could never imagine looking at those numbers and being like, oh, my God.  They all match.  Yeah.  Like, when you check your numbers, it's like, it is won.  And you can tell just by looking quickly at it that it's not a winner.  Do you put yourself close to the story like I do?  Like, they had the news guy outside the 7-Eleven, outside the Beltway down there in Maryland. 
[00:09:30]  Oh.  And I'm thinking to myself, God, maybe if I would have fucking, I don't know, drove to  Washington, maybe I would have stopped for gas there.  Fuck.  Get a quick pick, and then you would have gotten it.  It's the famous joke, but were you going to Washington?  No.  No, but I've done that ride before.  Might have.  Might have had to piss.  But it is creepy to see the store.  All of a sudden, it's like, that was the store.  That's it.  All I had to do was be there.  Made somebody a millionaire. 
[00:10:00]  I bought them, though.  I played my numbers.  Oh, you did?  I played my numbers.  They were, I'll tell you what they are not, because I'll never play them again.  There was two versions.  20, 31, uh, fuck, 42.  20, 31, 42.  No, I'll remember.  Because he's going to play these now.  20, 31.  42.  40.  8.  No, 40, 30, 42, 52. 
[00:10:30]  Powerball.  40, 42, 52.  The Powerball, one of each.  Oh, right.  That's right.  You got the whole thing.  And then the other one I played, I forget what it was.  It was a variation of that, because I saw the number 42, and it seemed too close.  It was like 1, 20, 31.  I mean, 8, 20, 31.  But I played both, and I played all versions, and then I bought a couple of, uh, I spent  100 bucks.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, I didn't win.  You know, the, you know, people went into that 7-Eleven, uh, the one they know where the  winning ticket was sold, and, um, they started taking pictures with the machine. 
[00:11:00]  People are idiots.  People are dicks.  People are told.  That's the machine.  They took pictures with the winning machine.  Here it is.  I hope this pig didn't win, though, because, uh, when you're playing with other people,  and then someone sends you to the store, you can't all of a sudden say, this is my ticket.  Yep.  Can't do it.  You're going to lose in court.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah, I think she's in, uh, trouble.  Yeah, I think so.  There were a lot of, uh, $100,000 winners, I guess.  Oh, yeah? 
[00:11:30]  Ben and Lawrence, thanks for that.  What's that?  Without the, uh, power, without the, uh, power.  Without the power ball.  Without the mega ball.  Without the mega ball.  I bought 200 games, and I had the power ball in five.  Five of them, I had the power ball number.  And in those five, two of them, I had one number in the game itself.  So, that's all, that's the closest I had.  One number and power ball number twice.  Well, I picked, I had the right amount of numbers picked. 
[00:12:00]  Like, I did pick five, and I did pick one power ball.  So, there, I was right on the money.  Right on the money there.  After that, the wheels kind of came off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyone play one, two, three, four, five?  Uh, yeah, I think a few people did.  Yeah.  Oh, there's my tickets.  Uh, this guy goes, we used to photocopy all the tickets when we, uh, played in a pool.  But I don't get playing in a pool.  I could go buy my own tickets.  I guess they figure, you know.  The odds increase with more people.  You're in there.  You're in there.  Is that what it is? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  And then you split it.  What are the odds?  If each, if each guy.  They increase by how much?  If each of you guys, let's say that all of us do it, and there's six of us in this room,  we all buy ten tickets.  Right.  You get ten shots.  But you got 60 shots if fucking, uh.  But then you get a lot less money, too.  Yep.  But how would you feel.  I would take that chance.  How would you feel if you went in and fucking, we got nothing, and fucking dumb Sam or Mars  won?  You'd be like, why didn't I just, I was that, I would rather split money than be that close 
[00:13:00]  and, all right, then this is what you do.  You do the pool thing, and then you do the individual thing.  Like that lady.  Buy your own tickets.  Like the lady did.  She's smart.  Like the lady.  So now I believe her.  She didn't buy her own fucking tickets.  What a load of shit that is.  The manager, uh, one of the managers at Caroline's works for the post office.  He had a multi-year career, and he said one time.  At a, like a section of where he was, they would always play together.  It wasn't his section.  Right.  And they won.  Um, he said a group, they won like 20 million or whatever they won.  What?  Um, not, but it wasn't his.  It was some post office people. 
[00:13:30]  Oh.  And he said they had to bring in grief counselors, like for people around because they were so  fucking depressed.  Every night you go to bed, you're thinking, I could have totally had a change in life.  Oh, there was one woman who would always collect the tickets for people, but she had called  in sick that day.  Oh, God.  And nobody put her in, and then there was regular people who were like, fuck her, like  we don't usually play with her, we're not splitting money with her.  And what, one of the winners, uh, bought one ticket. 
[00:14:00]  One single ticket.  Damn.  One ticket, see?  See, you buy a bunch of tickets, you do this, you do all kinds of strategies, pooling  it in, one ticket, you win.  I would just go and buy my own tickets.  I never bought, I didn't really get into the lottery ticket thing, did you?  I get scratch-offs every once in a while.  Only when it's a huge prize, but, you know.  Get it for my birthday or Christmas or something weird like that, it's kind of fun.  I get sucked into the whole fucking thing that was going on over Friday.  Everybody was like, whoa, whoa.  And I was poor most of my life. 
[00:14:30]  And still never play the numbers.  Did you play the numbers when you were working, Joanne?  Yeah, occasionally, man, mostly just to get a scratch-off ticket when I was at the deli  getting lunch.  Yeah.  But as far as, like, playing a lot, I don't know.  You didn't have a, you didn't have, like, numbers.  Like, a lot of the people we're talking right now, they have their numbers, you know.  Nah.  And they're going to play their numbers until the day they die.  They'll still be playing on their deathbed.  There used to be, the lottery here in New York used to be, you'd buy a ticket, and it was 
[00:15:00]  just kind of numbers that were already on the ticket.  Right.  Like, you didn't get to pick your own numbers.  Oh, I know.  This is years ago.  And the first prize was a million dollars.  And it was like, that was, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And then there was, with the lottery campaign where they had a bunch of winners.  Yeah.  And there was one guy named Curtis Sharp.  Good old Curtis.  He had a fucking, like, fedora on.  Was he one of the first winners of Black Dude, right?  Yeah.  He goes, I won five million bucks. 
[00:15:30]  Yep.  Five million bucks.  And then they had a bunch of lottery guys in certain New York-like settings.  So he was at a hot dog cart.  And he goes, yeah, give me one with everything.  And don't be sting you with the mustard.  Don't be sting you with the mustard.  Is this it?  Lou Eisenberg is the other guy.  That's right.  Oh, let's hear this.  No, it's great.  He still has his money today, doesn't he?  Does he?  No.  Of course not.  He's broke.  Is he really?  Child of the 80s should remember this.  He's probably dead at this point.  Right.  Hey, Curtis.  Huh?  Remember when we hit New York's lotto for all those millions? 
[00:16:00]  Man, we were hot stuff.  But now they got this new lotto 48 Wednesday and Saturday.  The jackpot start and the millions.  It could really get big.  Makes us look like pinning pitchers.  We gotta play lotto 48.  Right.  But first, let's see.  Two, please.  And don't be sting you with the mustard.  They stop at like a fucking drive-thru and he pops out of the top of a limo.  Don't be sting you with the mustard.  Sting you? 
[00:16:30]  Sting you?  Don't be sting you with the mustard.  Whatever happened to him?  Could you Google?  I hope that they have their money.  Oh, Curtis.  No, Curtis.  I bet he was Curtis Rich with it.  I bet he invested it smartly.  Maybe.  Oh, boy, no.  Let's see.  What happened to Curtis?  Curtis had some problems.  Five prizes start in the millions.  I think he was homeless by 1990.  Oh, no.  I don't think it ended well for Curtis.  Let's see.  Danny Ross would have had this up already.  Before we mentioned it.  Would have had it fucking up. 
[00:17:00]  Would have had the history of this guy.  How could you not find Curtis Sharp's fucking lotto?  What happened to him?  Sam's looking for Curtis Blow, the fucking rapper.  Let me see.  Turn it this way.  You're not home reading.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Known for his dapper, a three-piece suit.  Showed off millions.  But his funds dissipated.  The money's gone.  Sharp then 71 told the Daily News in 2009.  I bought into a lot of things that went bad.  Oh, no. 
[00:17:30]  Wait a minute.  I lost in the millions.  Wait a minute.  Bad investments.  In 2009, he was 71.  Yeah.  The commercial we saw of Curtis.  So that's, was it 85, 15, 24 years ago?  He was only 47?  47?  Oh, boy.  He was only 47 in that commercial?  Yeah, he didn't look too good.  I would have bet he was in his 60s already.  Oh, man.  He knows what it's like to have $5 million and then not.  He had $5 million from 1980. 
[00:18:00]  $5 million?  In 1985, $5 million.  Oh, geez.  What's that worth today?  $5 million from 1985 has got to be at least $20 million today.  Don't bestinue with the mustard.  So where's he living in all that?  Bad investments.  So obviously he has no money, but...  He should have been more stinue with his money.  But they could have been, like, it's amazing, in 85, can you imagine if he had a good guy  with him?  Like Shaq said, a guy who just told you to put it away.  Equities.  Were you investing some fuckin' Apple stock in that in 85?  Now find out what happened to Lou Eisenberg. 
[00:18:30]  He was the guy that was with him.  He was, like, one of the first lotto millionaires.  Let's see.  Lou Eisenberg.  But he seemed like he knew what he was doing.  Maybe.  Let's see.  Or is that racist?  What happened?  Let's see.  Lou Eisenberg, 81 winner, now living in mobile home.  No, really?  When Lou Eisenberg struck it rich in 1981, winning $5 million in what was then the largest  lottery payout ever, people started asking him for advice about money. 
[00:19:00]  All of a sudden, people were asking, Lou, what about this?  What about that?  Now 81, he recalled.  It turns out he was the one who needed the answers.  Nearly 30 years after winning numbers, all that's left are memories of his lucky day  and the whirlwind life of TV appearances, cheering fans, and travel and luxury.  The former millionaire now lives in a mobile home in Lake Worth, Florida, on $250 a week 
[00:19:30]  from Social Security.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Oh, boy.  Let's see.  What happened to him with installments?  In November, he was making $225 a week, changing light bulbs in an office building.  With installments, he won $219,000 a year, $130 after taxes, paid out over 20 years.  But he was able to quit his job and buy a $130,000 condo. 
[00:20:00]  That's nice.  All right.  As fame grew, so did his spending.  There were days at the track, trips to Europe and Hawaii, and dinners where the newly minted  millionaire always picked up the check.  Whoever needed something, I gave cash.  I wanted to be nice to people.  I had it, and I went with it.  Easy come, easy go.  The next line, of course.  He said he gave a big chunk of his winnings to his second ex-wife. 
[00:20:30]  He married a third time, but that didn't last either.  Oh, God.  What a dummy.  By 2001, he cashed the last lottery check.  He was broke.  Eisenberg now spends time at the dog track in West Palm Beach, Florida, and still bets  a penny here and there.  Having survived two heart operations, he copes with the pains of arthritis and carpal tunnel  syndrome.  It's probably from balling up his fist and hitting himself. 
[00:21:00]  He said he enjoyed the glam life and has few regrets about spending at all.  I wouldn't have done it any other way, he said.  I wish I had $200 in my pocket.  Now I have $18 or $19.  Lou Eisenberg.  I don't know.  That's what he said.  Poor Lou.  Poor Lou Eisenberg.  He looked nice.  He was Eisenberg rich.  He looked good.  He looked like a CEO, that guy.  He won.  His fucking wife took it.  Oh, God.  Are you still in on this stock? 
[00:21:30]  Which one?  I'm not going to say.  No.  What the fuck?  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  How are you still in that?  Isn't that like fucking 17 years?  I forgot about it.  I forgot about it.  Man.  It finally popped.  I punched out at like fucking 35 a share years ago.  Very nice.  Years ago.  It's up to 64.  Damn, yo.  64.  You're probably still not vested knowing fucking Brucey Mittman. 
[00:22:00]  Boys.  Boys.  This stock's going to come in, boys.  We're not going to give you a raise.  We're going to give you options.  Boys.  Man.  God, that's how we got our fucking raises back in the day.  They gave us stock options.  Too broke.  With no guarantee the damn thing was going to go up.  Too broke-ass motherfuckers.  But in 1985, they were living the highlights.  Let me just hear her say that line again at the end of the commercial.  Lizzie.  Lizzie.  Too please.  And don't be stingy with the mustard. 
[00:22:30]  You have to break it down because we've all fucking done some production and shit.  Yeah.  You know they were trying to get them to say stingy.  Say stingy.  And they finally had to go, all right, this is the best it's going to be.  So stingy it is.  Is it in you?  Right.  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Why wouldn't they just try another word there?  Stingy?  Stingy?  Stingy?  Stingy?  Stingy with the mustard.  Don't be stingy with the mustard?  You think they try to have him do it in two parts?  I don't think they gave a shit. 
[00:23:00]  Thought he was fucking funny with that derby on.  Yeah.  His little derby.  Just throwing money out the fucking windows of the limo.  E-Rock tweeted a picture last night there.  E-Rock!  I want everyone to take a look at E-Rock Radio for the people out there.  Oh my God.  What the fuck happened?  He's with Mr. Cowhead on Twitter.  And we like the Mr. Cowhead.  I like Cowhead, but I don't like the fat lobster he's standing with.  Stupid E-Rock is down there in Miami for WrestleMania, which happened last night.  And obviously he decided to hang out by the pool before WrestleMania. 
[00:23:30]  Fuck.  He has the worst sunburn on his face.  His nose looks so painfully red.  And then his cheeks.  And his lips and chin.  His lips look like they're sunburned.  Yeah.  I think he just treated himself down there by the pool.  Oh, boy, did he.  Oh, he treated himself.  You think?  Yes.  And then I'm trying to figure out what kind of sunglasses he was wearing because he has  giant white circles around his eyes.  Not the little ones that you kind of get because you forget and you keep your sunglasses on too 
[00:24:00]  long.  He obviously had like cataract fucking sunglasses on or something.  Wraparounds.  Because he looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  But in the picture, he's posing like, I'm going to look good for this picture.  I'm at WrestleMania and me and Cowhead will get a picture together.  Yeah.  His dumb Percy face.  He's Percy.  Oh, he's all fucking.  How slappable is that cheek?  I want to know why he got so fucking sunburned.  I actually do know.  Because he's an asshole. 
[00:24:30]  He won't answer his phone, but he did.  Why would he answer his phone?  What's wrong with him?  I don't know.  He did tweet to somebody last night that he doesn't use any of that suntan lotion.  Bullshit?  Really?  No.  He goes out with the oil on and lets the tan burn in.  That's good.  That's great, E-Rock.  That's a great look you got going.  Well, how about you at least take the sunglasses off then?  So you get an even face tan.  Oh, man.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  It looks like he's more burnt on the left side of his face.  And the right side.  Look at the forehead it stops. 
[00:25:00]  Look.  You know he fell asleep with his head down on one side a little bit.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  And Mr. Cowhead got all dressed up for WrestleMania, huh?  Is that the thing to do down there?  I guess.  He's a classy guy, Cowhead.  Were you pissed you didn't go, Sam?  I was until I started getting E-Rock stories.  E-Rock was not happy with his WrestleMania experience.  No?  Which has nothing to do with the company, right?  No, E-Rock.  He went on his own dime?  He paid for his tickets, yeah.  Right.  Couldn't they comp him a ticket?  I would think so, but I think he wanted the best possible tickets. 
[00:25:30]  He wanted the best seats that money could buy.  But they won't, with all the wrestlers that we know, they wouldn't, I guess they have families  and stuff, but they wouldn't give him like a decent floor seat?  I don't know.  I mean, they might have.  I think he didn't want to take the chance, and he was taking his nephew.  Oh, okay.  There are also lots of celebrities and people who go to WrestleMania.  I've never gone to one.  I would like to go once.  It's the best.  We did go.  I'm trying to remember.  It's going to be.  What year did we go, Sam?  2000.  In Anaheim?  Sam knows this.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  2000, we were there.  It was nice.  It's going to be what?  It's going to be in New York next year.  Is it?  Giant Stadium.  LA Stadium.  What year?  I mean, what month?  April 7th.  It could rain, right?  It's cold.  Yeah, it could be.  It could snow.  So why don't they, do they have to have it in April every year?  It's not like the Super Bowl.  It's made up.  So can't they say, you know, this year, let's make it in May where we know the weather's  going to be nicer?  It's the 29th year.  That's so stupid.  It's the 29th year they're doing it.  They're not going to change in a month.  But if you make up all the shit, then it doesn't matter.  What difference is it?  Do the Super Bowl a month later, then? 
[00:26:30]  Why would you take the chance that it could rain or even snow?  It could still snow in April.  Because it's cool.  Why don't you play football in the summer?  What?  What are you talking about?  It's different.  It's so different.  You're still sitting in the snow.  It's not different at all.  You don't want people sitting in a rainy fucking stadium for WrestleMania.  You just don't.  So then how come they play football in the winter months?  Because it's a man's sport.  You bundle up.  Then what's the difference?  You don't want to bundle up for WrestleMania. 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  The difference is football, you don't have a choice.  They have a set schedule.  You know what you're getting.  Who has a set?  They made up the schedule.  It's a real sport, though, so they can't fuck with the set schedule.  They could just change it.  It's made up.  No.  Somebody made up the schedule.  No, wrestling could change it.  I'm not going to argue with you.  My God.  It's just the schedule.  You can change anything.  I think Vince is stupid.  He's not stupid.  It's the same thing every year.  He came up with the XFL.  Let's play football in the middle of winter. 
[00:27:30]  He's dumb.  And now he's dumb with his WrestleMania in New York next year.  You don't know.  He's taking a big chance that it could rain or snow.  And if it rains, it's going to be one of those cold rains.  It's going to be great, though.  Yeah, but you're going to watch it on pay-per-view.  It's going to be raining.  Everybody's going to be sitting there.  It's going to be awesome.  Oh, 80,000 people are going to be like, yeah, this is great.  Absolutely.  I love being fucking cold in the rain.  I'll bring a poncho.  Did Undertaker win?  Yes, he did.  20 and 0, huh?  20 and 0.  In WrestleMania's?  Yeah, and he looks like Chuck Liddell now.  He's got a shaved head with a mohawk. 
[00:28:00]  Really?  He completely shaved his head, yeah.  Was Brock there?  No, but there are heavy rumors that he's signed.  So if he signed, why wouldn't he show up at WrestleMania?  Because everybody was kind of already talking about it, so it would have not been a big surprise  that it could have been.  It wouldn't have been exciting if all of a sudden he walked out?  Well, I mean, people are already buying it, so they might have saved it for tonight.  Somewhere else.  Yeah.  Somewhere needed.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Save it for TV ratings tonight.  Fair enough. 
[00:28:30]  But fuck all that.  Iraq is pissed off?  Well, Iraq got there, and he paid, like, several hundred dollars for each of the three tickets  that he bought.  Oh, God.  How much?  Like, I mean, he told me $1,200 for the three tickets.  Wow.  But I've been told that he was underestimating.  Where does he get all this money from?  He's good.  He's so rich.  He's good, man.  It's the Nagel's fortune.  He's got rich parents or something.  Castle Nagel.  His family's got a little cash. 
[00:29:00]  He's very well paid here.  He's taken care of, so.  Because $1,200 plus the flight down, plus hotel rooms.  And Iraq, as much as we beat him up, he's a generous guy, so he's probably taking care  of, you know, whoever he brought to WrestleMania, so he's bringing a lot of pocket money as well.  Oh, he's definitely brought pocket money.  Do you think he wanted to buy things there?  Yeah, he probably did.  But he also bought a house this year.  A Nagel always pays his debts.  But I believe that his brother took care of airfare and hotel.  Yeah.  And he took care of the tickets.  That was the whole deal.  All right, so what's the problem?  Why is he mad? 
[00:29:30]  Well, he paid for the second floor section, right?  Because, like, the first five rows were, like, $1,000 a ticket.  He wasn't going to do that.  So he's, like, maybe 30 rows behind on the floor, but the seats weren't raised at all.  So he couldn't see a thing.  Because it's a football stadium.  Did it sell out?  Yeah.  Yeah, they set a record.  I think they had 78,000 people to lose.  Wow.  78,000 people. 
[00:30:00]  Good for the WWE.  Yeah, they set a record.  Still real to me!  Damn it.  Damn it!  I think they're going to try to get 80 in.  What's it start?  8 o'clock?  7.  It starts early now.  And there's a buzz, right, before that happens?  There's fucking electricity in the building?  Oh, God, yeah.  They do stuff for a week beforehand, yeah.  In Miami.  As much as I make fun of it, I really enjoyed going to WrestleMania.  Yeah, they know what's a great show.  I want to do it once.  Do it next year.  So 30 seats back, 30 rows back, obviously you can't see shit.  No.  So he went all the way down there to watch WrestleMania on a big screen. 
[00:30:30]  On the big screen.  Everybody was talking about the Undertaker's entrance, and he said he didn't know what he  was wearing.  He couldn't see the entrance.  Oh, man.  He thought he was going to get a great seat.  And if you're in the stadium seats, the actual stadium seats, you can see everything  perfectly.  Right.  And he was sending me photos.  The floor seats are so overrated a lot of times.  Terrible.  He was sending me photos.  Like, the first photo, he was like, this is where I'm sitting.  And it looked cool and everything, but you could tell he had his arms up way to take  the picture.  Right.  And then he sent me another picture.  He was like, unfortunately, most of the show I'm watching from here. 
[00:31:00]  And he sent me a picture of him facing, with his back to the ring, facing one of the  big screens.  Oh, God.  What a big jerk.  We couldn't be happier.  Yeah.  What a maroon.  But why haven't they figured out how to put some kind of platform, you know, that elevates  very slightly?  Yeah.  They do something like that at the garden.  Yeah, I think they do, right?  Yeah.  They could bring in, like, subtle...  Just a slight ramp.  But the floor is the floor, though.  Like, when you're on the floor, it's like the garden floor goes back pretty far.  So does the Meadowlands.  Right.  And then the risers come up. 
[00:31:30]  But before the risers, you just are on the floor.  And they want to fit in, like, this is WWE.  How did you say no?  No.  I've been to certain shows at the garden where I've had floor seats in the back, and they  do put up risers.  Ah.  So there's, you know, the floor, and then when it gets far back enough where it's like,  okay, if these people are level...  Behind the soundboard?  Yes.  Behind the soundboard, it becomes risers.  They definitely should have risers for this.  But WWE is all about setting these records.  So, like, they're trying to fit in as many seats into that stadium as possible. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  Because, you know, like, they were bragging, they were like, you know, there's been Super  Bowls here, and we beat it, but that's because the football field is so big that they can't  fit in as many seats.  Oh, no, of course.  Giant Stadium, they'll easily get 80.  Yeah.  I think U2 shows have done 80.  Why not Texas Stadium?  It's bigger.  I think they're going to try to do Dallas for 30 and do 100,000.  Damn.  Can you imagine?  I think.  For 30?  That's crazy.  For WrestleMania 30.  So who will wrestle in it?  Who knows?  I don't know.  Who would wrestle in it?  But I mean, like, who will they use, you think?  We don't know who's hot.  I mean, the assumption is that Brock will have a big match at WrestleMania 29 next year. 
[00:32:30]  Well, they, I mean, I know that, you know, the results, of course, I was happy that CM  Punk, I mean, I like Chris Jarko, too, but I was happy that he did well.  I would have been happy if Jarko won.  Spoiler alert.  What happened?  CM Punk won?  He retained the WWE Championship.  What happens to Jericho now?  I mean, he's still, you know.  Look at the script.  Jericho.  I was trying to go with that joke, and I felt miserable.  Oh, shit.  Well, don't forget we have, of course, The Rock was victorious over John Cena. 
[00:33:00]  How do you know all the results?  Oh, man.  I'm a big wrestling fan.  You are.  Were you watching?  Yeah.  You didn't watch.  Yeah.  Well.  There was all that bumping and leg stuff.  Somebody was trying to ruin my WrestleMania experience by tweeting me jokes while I was  watching.  Texting him.  Oh, I see.  Oh, yeah, texting me jokes.  That's great.  So, Cena won?  No, The Rock won.  But that's dumb, because he has to go back and make movies now, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't like that The Rock won.  Yeah, what's he going to do?  He's not going to be able to.  Was it a good match?  Yeah, it was a good match.  The Rock will be on. 
[00:33:30]  I can't wait to hear about it on the shit show.  Yeah, exactly.  You're right.  The reason we brought this up, and it's right, who gives a fuck about the results, but  E-Rock's experience was completely ruined.  That's what we really want to talk about.  I like the logistics behind it.  Thank you, Ann.  Thank you.  The E-Rock thing that, but as far as the results go and everything.  All of a sudden, I'm like, I'm listening to wrestling results.  I'm listening to that.  But I'm curious if the match was good.  The Rock has a wrestle.  I want to know what happened.  Two sweaty men throwing each other around.  That's absolutely right.  Did they do the whole people's ankle thing?  Oh, God.  That's right, though, man.  Maybe a couple results really quick. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, all right.  We can handle that.  Yeah, the big story.  The only reason we brought this up was because E-Rock had a miserable experience.  I want to know more about his miserable experience.  Why don't we answer his phone this morning?  Is he home?  He's a dick.  No, he's still in the hotel in Miami.  You should call him.  I don't know what hotel.  Of course, he's not going to tell me what hotel.  E-Rock thinks he's a privileged member of the Opie and Anthony show.  Fucking guy.  Your whole job is, if you go away, you're going to be woken up by us.  Answer the fucking phone.  Too fucking bad.  Exactly.  Try him again. 
[00:34:30]  That's his whole gig.  Sorry, bitch.  The badness didn't stop there for Eric, though.  No, what happened?  Well, you know, he's texting me.  Like, he texted me during the Hell in a Cell match, and he goes, they didn't use the cell  at all in that match.  And I go, what are you talking about?  The whole first part of the match, they were on the floor throwing each other under the  cage.  And he goes, oh, I couldn't see any of that part.  And then, at like 9.45, I got a text from him, and he goes, dude, the stadium ran out 
[00:35:00]  of food.  Oh, my God.  Why does he make it so easy?  Come on, he did.  Yeah.  He texted us.  Maybe they saw him coming to the concession stands and went, holy fuck, let's shut down  for a while.  We can't handle this order.  He was so pissed.  He started texting like, uh...  At 9.45, didn't that mean it was almost over?  No, it ended at 11.  All right, so another hour.  He could wait an hour?  Yeah, I mean, you have your meal by then, if you're going to eat at the stadium.  It started at, you know, there's a pre-show at 6.30. 
[00:35:30]  How much ice cream and treats do you need?  Oh, so much.  Yay!  Pin the man!  Pin the man!  He threw the ice cream on his face.  He was getting up multiple times for treats.  Oh, yeah, they were probably splitting it, or you go now and bring me back a Diablo pretzel  with 40 cookies on it.  Yay!  Pin the man!  He was just waddling up the aisle.  Waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle.  When I went to SummerSlam with him a couple years ago, and the big thing was Triple H's  comeback, E-Rock missed Triple H's entrance because he was getting multiple pretzels. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  But he texted me, and he said his brother lapped the entire stadium.  Hot dogs, but no buns.  That's the most exercise a Nigel has done in decades.  Oh, man, right?  Hot dogs, but no buns.  What?  Nachos, no cheese.  Ran out of hamburgers, chicken, and cups for soda.  How about you have a fucking, how about you have something light?  Oh, man.  Get a bag of peanuts.  What a light snack. 
[00:36:30]  A carrot.  A carrot, please.  Do you think he was eating poorly at the Wrestlemania?  Oh, God, yeah.  The only time he'll eat a carrot is when you put it flat in your hand.  A sugar cube chaser.  Yes, of course.  Poor E-Rock ran out of food.  That's tragic.  So, so far, he had to turn his back to the fucking ring to watch Wrestlemania.  Watch the show on the big screen.  Maybe that's what happened to his face.  He was bobbing for french fries.  That old gag. 
[00:37:00]  That's a good old gag, though, man.  Oh, and you know, he loves celebrity pictures.  Yeah.  Andy Garcia was there, I guess, near him.  And he went up to meet Andy Garcia, but his camera ran out of battery.  Boy, he just fucking...  Why wouldn't you have the fucking camera charge?  Yeah, fully charge.  Doesn't he have a phone with him?  He tweeted that his camera ran out of it.  So how about to take a picture with the phone?  He had no picture with Andy Garcia.  He's a dolt.  And then, on his way out, he said he was just waiting in traffic for all this time. 
[00:37:30]  And I guess everybody was, because apparently there's only, like, one way out or something.  Oh, my God.  And there was 78,000 people just trying to get out in one.  That's the worst.  That's why I will never stay to the end of any event.  Yeah, so...  I leave early, because I can't fucking take that kind of traffic.  Because I love when you leave a game early, and people have to go,  Oh, assholes, leave it early.  They have to make a big deal, because you're leaving early.  Fuck you.  Yeah, fuck you.  I guess this game is obviously over, and I'm not going to be in a parking lot for an hour. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, call me an asshole.  It's everything I hate about driving.  It's traffic.  There's people that don't know how to, like, get in.  And there's other people that don't let people in when it's obvious you have to at a certain point.  It's dead stop.  I hate it.  I've got to get the fuck out of there.  Believe me, there's been plenty of times I've left, like, a Yankee game or something,  and you're in the parking lot, and there's no one else there.  You get in your car, and you're just hearing,  Wah!  From the stadium.  Oh, yeah.  I won't leave...  It does have its downside. 
[00:38:30]  Look, I won't leave during a World Series game.  I've never done that.  And I won't leave if it's close, and I think, you know, they're going to pull it off or something like that.  But if it's a blowout, shit, I'm fucking gone.  Why am I staying?  We went to...  Go ahead.  We went to SummerSlam in England in Wembley Stadium when I was a kid.  Wembley.  Wembley.  Oh, I wish there was a song written about you from the empty seat.  Oh, Jesus.  There was...  I wish you were dead.  I got it.  You figured it out. 
[00:39:00]  There was, like, 89,000 people there.  Wow.  And we ended up parking just on some field.  Like, they just threw cars on there.  Yeah.  We were literally...  My dad was driving us out of that parking lot for two hours.  Two hours!  Just sitting there after this long wrestling show.  He must have wanted to kill you.  It's fucking insanity.  Because he didn't go for himself.  No.  He must have wanted to kill you.  I get all freaked out, too.  Like, I start thinking, like, there's no option to this.  I'll never leave.  Like, there's no option where I could go, all right, you know what? 
[00:39:30]  I'm just going to put the fucking...  The rotors up and fucking helicopter my ass out of here.  I wasn't going to, but you are stuck there for the duration, period.  Yeah.  Done.  Ugh, it's fucking tragic.  Yeah.  I hate that.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  So, E-Rock had a shitty time.  And...  We couldn't be happier.  He was all excited because Mike Tyson was there because he was inducted into the Hall of Fame.  Oh.  Right.  And they had Mike Tyson doing a signing at their Fan Fest.  Oh.  And beforehand, E-Rock said he was going to get a Mike Tyson autograph. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  But, of course, Mr. Lazy got there just after Mike Tyson had left.  Oh, no.  Do you think it was his laziness?  Definitely.  Well, no, it's because he fell asleep in the sun, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah, he had to get in some pool time.  No, is it true?  I want to know about his pool time.  And, by the way, he didn't take his shirt off.  It's only his face that's bright.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, he was laying out there.  Oh, my God.  Is it true Mike Tyson was signing four autographs at once?  I heard that.  Oh, boy.  How?  I don't know.  I just heard it.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God. 
[00:40:30]  But it's a character for the show.  What?  I didn't say anything.  I don't know.  It's just a character.  What?  What?  What happened?  I just heard that somewhere.  I'm sure he was just going one at a time.  He probably had four pages lined up.  Right.  Exactly.  That's what I meant.  And then he'd give those out, and then the next four.  Right.  Exactly.  No, I don't know.  For sure.  So is he answering his phone?  No.  Fuck.  That's his job around here.  We don't need him for any of this other crap.  Anyone could do his job.  Maybe.  This is where he shines when we wake him up. 
[00:41:00]  His voice is sharp in that picture.  Is he yelled a lot?  Yeah, yeah.  He's probably chanting for the rock.  Go, rock!  Pin him!  He's probably chanting Rocky all night.  Oh, no.  Do they chant Rocky?  Rocky, Rocky.  No, they don't.  The other half of the arena goes,  Sina, Sina.  See what you're doing here?  You're trying to bring it back.  That's right.  To where we'll hear this on the after show.  Oh, please.  Look at that.  Not on the after show. 
[00:41:30]  The after show.  Not on the after show.  Please, no.  That's the fucking show that comes out of the fucking vagina after the real show.  Ew, look.  A bunch of after show.  That's pretty good.  Terrible.  A bunch of promo out of that.  Man.  Well, we should have E-Rock on right now.  We should, and we would if he wasn't such a fucking asshole.  Once again, he lets down the show.  Exactly.  Does he get mad when we wake him up?  Very upset.  Very angry.  Why?  He doesn't understand why he gets picked on when he's not here. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Why not?  I don't know.  I try to tell him.  Troy got picked on last week hard.  He can't function before his first cup of lard.  He likes a cup of thick, and he warms like candle wax.  We can just eat it slowly.  But could you mention in the next meeting, Sam, that these guys have to be available to  be woken up?  Available.  It's part of our show.  I'll bring it up on Tuesday.  Please.  Direct order from Opie Anthony and Jim Norton. 
[00:42:30]  Guys.  You've got to be available to be woken up.  Yeah.  It's part of the fucking show.  Come on.  Part of the show is if he was sitting in that room right there.  Right.  All you've got to do is leave your phone on ringer instead of vibrate.  Yes.  Please.  E-Rock tweeted a picture of a great parking spot he got.  Can we go to his Twitter really quickly?  And then we'll fucking go to break and move on to all this shit.  Fucking E-Rock.  You were getting texts during the WrestleMania?  Yeah.  I was getting some wrestling jokes.  I guess they were wrestling jokes.  They're probably really good, right? 
[00:43:00]  Chip.  Apparently he's a wrestling fan.  Or he says he is.  Got something in common.  Here's his...  He says, now that's a parking spot.  That was the last positive thing he had to say about his WrestleMania experience.  Oh my God.  He doesn't even know how to park, right?  No.  He's terrible at it.  Wait, wait.  What?  He's close to the stadium, right?  Right.  Like he's parking...  That is the dumbest...  I don't know why people do that.  You don't want to be there.  I am first car at the exit.  And I'll sacrifice the walk.  But you know what?  That's the difference.  E-Rock... 
[00:43:30]  Why do people do that?  I've never understood that.  Because E-Rock's never had a moment in his life where he's like, no problem.  I'll walk.  Right, right.  That's true.  The walk is the problem.  So that doesn't even come into his brain that if I park near the exit, I have to walk, but  I'll be the first one out of here.  I won't have to wait two hours in the parking lot.  He goes, look, there's a parking spot up there.  I could have the machine do the work for me and take me to there.  Oh my God.  And that's it.  It's like my WrestleMania experience is doing great.  You're just tucking yourself in where it's going to take forever to get out of there. 
[00:44:00]  Of course.  It's the worst parking spot.  I never understood the people that do that, but whatever.  Go ahead.  What else did he tweet?  Man.  Let's see.  E-Rack.  That Andy Garcia didn't have his camera.  It's just him rambling.  Fair enough.  Sun Life Stadium Complex is a horrible facility.  Poorly designed, poorly run.  Wow.  Nagel has spoken.  Somebody changed his tune.  That's right.  You know, he sucks.  As much as we make fun, WrestleMania is a huge, big deal. 
[00:44:30]  And we had a guy that was there, and he's too lazy to keep his phone on.  I had him.  Give the WrestleMania.  Tell me what was going on in Florida yesterday on my show.  But why wouldn't he think of what we're calling in today and talking about his adventure?  Yeah, yeah.  Talking about his adventure.  This is a massive event.  78,000 there.  How many on pay-per-view?  They were saying, like, they don't know yet, but they're saying this could be the highest.  But you know the numbers ahead of time.  I mean, it'll be millions.  But, like, tens of millions? 
[00:45:00]  I don't know.  Where are we at?  All over the world, right?  All over the world.  Yeah, they're saying this could be the highest-watched wrestling show ever.  And we got a guy that went, and he turns his phone off.  I mean, Roxena is arguably the biggest match of all time.  Arguably.  And he was there, and he's not picking up his phone.  Arguable.  It is arguable.  Come on, the classics.  Some of the classics.  I would say Bob Backlund against Chief J. Strongbow.  Oh, yeah.  Which we won't talk about here.  Well, then, sir.  When does Prince Nagel get back to Castle Numbskull?  Yeah.  What time does Operation Dumbo Drop commence? 
[00:45:30]  Make curtains, thank you.  We're going to make it hurt a little more now.  What time do you come back?  I think this afternoon or this evening.  Oh, great.  So we'll talk about it tomorrow.  Yeah.  When no one gives a fuck.  Right.  Let's try him.  Who's that?  Oh, that's Kid Chris.  It is?  I haven't seen him in a while.  Yeah.  Wow.  Eric must have been in paradise.  He was hanging out with wrestlers and radio people.  Why does Eric have a mean face on?  I don't know.  He's probably trying to do the Sam Roberts face. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what he's doing.  Is his number on the outgoing message?  I don't want to give his number up.  Who's that?  J-Dubs from the hideout.  He's just going around taking pictures with radio people.  Why?  Oh, God.  He loves radio.  He really does.  But why do you take pictures with guys like that?  He's a student of radio.  Why would he say hi and hang out or whatever?  Enjoy yourself.  Yeah.  He's tweeting pictures of other radio people.  Why does he begin this morning?  He was all excited.  The young boy goes to the big event, so now he's got to go sleepy and dream about it. 
[00:46:30]  I bet he's asleep with his hands at his side and his shoes are still on.  His big dumb face is in a pillow, half-eating ice cream sundae.  Oh, he's just thinking about it.  A 98%-eating ice cream sundae.  He's dreaming.  He has a good seat.  This is not like his honeymoon.  He's on a vacation.  This is a travel day.  Get the fuck up, fatso.  Plus, you called him on his honeymoon, so even if it was like his honeymoon, it would be okay.  Man.  What?  The honeymoon thing was 10 minutes out of a week.  He was so pissed. 
[00:47:00]  So pissed that he didn't quit the show.  Is that the goal?  Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's eat, huh?  You want to eat?  I'm pretty hungry.  All right.  We'll figure out what to do next.  I would like to hear about Sam's bachelor party.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Well, you tell.  I'll bet that was an evening of a few regrets.  I'll bet that was an evening of naughtiness. 
[00:47:30]  What did you do?  I'll bet that was an evening of a lot of naughty behavior.  A lot of some boys being boys.  Boys.  You.  That's uncomfortable.  I don't know.  Are we allowed to talk about this?  I don't know.  Did everybody make like a little pact?  What did you do? 
[00:48:00]  Stop touching me.  Yes, there's no pact.  I bet it all, what happens in the, what happens in the, oh, I don't even want to say where they went.  Might be a big secret.  It's me.  Get in here.  No, we're not going to be tickling.  Creep.  Creep.  Imagine actually hanging out with people like that. 
[00:48:30]  You know, come on.  Fess up.  Get over here.  A lot of craziness.  I bet it was nonstop.  Because I saw you.  Well, I don't want to give it away until later.  Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.  But Jimmy's getting up with those tickle.  Trying to block him with a chair.  I'll do that.  Hit my heart on it.  I'll talk about that.  We'll talk about how Chevy Chase is an asshole.  We were trying to bring that up to Gillian.  It's Gillian, right?  Gillian.  A lot of people think it's Gillian, but it's Gillian. 
[00:49:00]  Gillian Jacobs.  Yeah, it's Gillian Jacobs.  We've hinted that we know that Chevy's an asshole.  And we know they all know that Chevy's an asshole.  But none of those people are talking yet.  And we've heard things from certain people that we can't really name.  Because we promised we wouldn't.  But now it comes out that Chevy is indeed a big fucking asshole.  Oh, Jack.  There's a phone call from him that is pretty good to listen to.  By the way, did you guys go to a club after called Neck Pimple?  Oh, man. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, is that what happens when glitter gets on your neck?  Sam has a fucking gremlin growing out of my neck.  Oh, my God.  It's a kickball.  What happened?  Did you try to dig it out?  It's a joined twin.  Yeah, I tried to.  I pinched that shit.  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  I squeeze all pimples.  Want me to do it?  No.  I squeeze and pick all pimples. 
[00:50:00]  Get that pus out immediately.  Didn't help anything.  I don't give a fuck.  I have tiny scars.  I don't need that shit on my body.  All right.  All right.  We'll talk about something next.  Serious, serious accents.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Do, do, do, do, do, do. 
[00:50:30]  Morning, everybody.  It's Monday.  Hi.  Hey, really quick, Ant.  The Knicks did some douchey thing to their fans. 
[00:51:00]  The New York Knicks, of course.  What did they do?  Very douchey.  Almost scumbaggy.  Scumbaggery?  Some scumbaggery?  Some scumbaggery.  Oh.  You got this Jeremy Lin, right?  Who's he?  Well, he's a phenom.  Wow.  That came out of nowhere.  A phenom?  I might have been a little wrong about the Jeremy Lin, because I don't know if he's going  to live up to the hype, that two-week hype that happened with the Jeremy Lin.  But he is a good point guard.  He's injured.  For the whole rest of the season.  He is injured. 
[00:51:30]  Lindured.  There is a chink in the armor.  That would be his knee.  That's a...  He has a knee injury.  I might have been wrong about the hype, although he's still a good point guard and all that.  But I did say on this very program that the one thing I was worried about with Jeremy  Lin, the way he plays basketball, he could get injured.  And injured bad.  Ah.  And?  Because he's always cutting hard left, cutting hard right, and he plays very physical.  And other teams have been trying to push him around the court a little bit, right? 
[00:52:00]  Blow that knee out?  Well, it turns out he's got a knee injury, right?  Oh, no.  And the Knicks sort of said Jeremy Lin's got this knee injury, but he's kind of playing  and whatnot.  Basically, what happened is, last Wednesday was the deadline to get your Knicks playoff  tickets.  Oh, man.  It was an actual deadline.  If you want to see the Knicks in the playoffs, you've got to get your tickets by Wednesday.  Right.  Last Wednesday.  The Knicks knew, as the deadline was looming, that Jeremy Lin was going to be out for the 
[00:52:30]  season.  But?  They didn't announce it until the deadline passed.  Exactly.  Because they're taking advantage of this whole Jeremy Lin thing.  Yeah.  So then everyone buys their playoff tickets.  And the Knicks are still a good team without Jeremy Lin, by the way.  They waited.  Everyone got their playoff tickets.  And then they announced, I think it was over the weekend, like maybe Saturday, I think,  that Jeremy Lin is out for the season.  But he also bought himself some more time because he doesn't have time to fall apart now.  So he kind of still was looking okay when he went out.  So next year he'll still be interesting. 
[00:53:00]  True.  Oh, no.  He'll come back from his injury.  But the fact is, the Knicks kind of used the whole Jeremy Lin thing to make sure everyone  was going to fucking sell out the garden for the playoffs, I guess.  That's exactly why they did it.  And I guess he needs a little surgery.  And they're saying he could possibly come back if the Knicks make the second round of  the playoffs.  So kind of a dick move, man, if you think about it.  But, I mean, you know, if they're sitting there thinking, well, you know, you're going to  make some money.  They don't give a fuck about their fans at all.  No, I know. 
[00:53:30]  They don't give a fuck, man.  Yeah, you're right.  But it should be pointed out.  Bunch of bastards.  It should be pointed out.  Bunch of bastards.  Glad you guys made it in this morning.  Oh, boy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I thought you guys might be out for a couple weeks now.  Oh, jeez, he's chasing Sam around the studio, tickling him.  You don't like, uh, that's Josh.  Josh?  Yeah.  Oh.  No, no, no, no.  We can't keep track of all these. 
[00:54:00]  That's his name.  Josh, yes.  But we don't even know Edgar yet.  Grenaturedly.  Edgar?  Grenaturedly.  Well, we don't know Edgar well enough for you to introduce a new character.  You're confusing everybody, sir.  I like pink face.  A very serious cookie.  Yes, they are.  Made for grown-up taste.  Yes.  Well, when I got word that, uh, that the, the guys were going to take Sam out because  he's getting married, uh, in like 60 days.  I'm glad that they didn't invite Josh good-naturedly.  Good-naturedly. 
[00:54:30]  You got less than 60 days, sir.  60 days.  Yes.  Yes.  Man.  Um, I'm not going to lie to you.  When I got the word that we're getting together for Sam's, uh, you know, I, I, bachelor party,  I guess, officially, I was like, this is going to be so fucking beat.  Why?  The guy doesn't drink.  The guy doesn't eat steak.  Oh, man.  And I'm thinking the guy doesn't even want to go to a strip club.  Right.  And then it comes, then it comes out that they're going to hang out at Jim Norton's show.  And that, and that doesn't stink. 
[00:55:00]  Don't get me wrong.  But I'm thinking bachelor party, we're going to hang out at Jim Norton's show.  That stinks for a bachelor party.  A little weird.  A little weird.  And I heard you guys were coming, and I saw Anthony on Saturday, but I didn't know  that you guys were there.  I felt terrible after, because I gave Anthony a shout out.  And at the end, I fucking see Opie, and these guys, and Sam and his family, I had no idea  you were there.  I was really fucking embarrassed that I had a shout out.  My dad felt like you.  He was shouted out, though, because you had a buttermilk joke in.  But yeah, I think I do a buttermilk line, and I literally, I almost said it's the world's  greatest treat, but I didn't know you were there. 
[00:55:30]  I would love to have said that with him in that fucking room.  By the way, you had a great set.  Yeah, yeah, thank you.  It was a phenomenal set.  Great set.  The middle guy was cool, too.  Who's he?  Annie Letterman was first, and his name is Sam.  Yeah, Sam.  The show, I thought, flowed well.  Everybody was good and different.  He should get props.  I didn't see the girl, because I came in late.  You came in late?  Oh, yeah, I forget his last name.  But he was great.  He was really good.  He was pretty funny, and we all had a good time at the Jim Norton slash Sam Roberts bachelor  party.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Very well behaved for a bachelor party, by the way.  I didn't know they were here.  I didn't hear that they were here.  Where were you guys sitting?  We were outside.  We were sitting.  No, we were towards the back-ish.  No, we were the first table, you know.  Up.  Up.  Definitely out of the usual table.  That's the perfect place to be.  Yeah, it was good to eat.  If you were looking out at the audience, we were just slightly to your right.  Okay.  I only saw Dummy, because he was like, as you're walking out from the back.  Yeah, they put me in the first two seats.  Oh, you were in those seats?  Yeah, yeah.  The side seats?  I don't mind that seat. 
[00:56:30]  No, they were actually, yeah, they were like rubbing a curtain.  Yeah, that's cool.  To back up slightly, and it's quick.  I went out to Long Island for the dumb Easter egg hunt that my cousin puts on.  And I call it dumb, which is stupid, because we had a really good time.  And then I came home, and I was tired.  I got kind of a slight sore throat.  I'm laying on the couch after we ate.  And I go to my wife.  I'm like, do I have to fucking go to this thing?  And I'm thinking, because it's going to be beat.  Sam doesn't want to do anything for his bachelor party.  He doesn't, like I said, doesn't drink, doesn't eat steak. 
[00:57:00]  They're at a Jim Norton show.  I've seen Jim a hundred fucking times.  No offense, Jimmy.  I'm a very fun person.  And Jimmy said, don't get confused.  Jimmy fucking rocked.  He's so ready for his special.  I was laughing at Bulls.  And she's the one, like, you've got to fucking step up.  I'm like, fuck.  Yeah.  You missed the pre-comedy cocktails.  Where was that at?  Oh!  That is spike mine!  But even though I thought that part was even weird, because I'm like, Sam doesn't drink, 
[00:57:30]  so why is everyone going to a bar before the Jim Norton show to have a few drinks?  Yeah, get nice and loose.  Let the evening, hey, what happens in this place stays in the morning.  Let me shake the chair.  A little pre-show, a little pre-show, right?  Just because I don't drink doesn't mean other people don't.  That's true.  Look, I'm wrong is what I'm saying in the end, because it was a great time.  I had a lot of fun.  I was very surprised.  Your brother put on a nice shindig.  Oh, yes, he did.  So then we ended up at, should we say the place? 
[00:58:00]  If you want to.  It was a gentleman's club.  Went to a gentleman's club.  Gentlemen.  You better use that in quotes.  Come on.  Get out of here.  Using the term loosely, right?  I'm not a fan of that fake gentleman crap, though, where everyone has to check their coat.  The doorman has a nice, long fucking, you know.  His trench coat on or something.  But really nice.  A suit jacket.  And they've got suit jackets, and they've got hats on.  It's like, look, man, half the people in here want to just make cumzies in their pants. 
[00:58:30]  Check your coat.  This isn't a gentleman's club.  They don't like hats in there.  No.  No hats allowed at the police.  And I'm like, I didn't even realize you're not allowed to even pull out your phone.  They don't want people snapping pictures of the ladies.  Sam had to tell me, like, dude, they told us, like, don't fucking even attempt to pull  out your phone.  I didn't even know, because I went to the bathroom while they were getting seated.  Yeah, they don't like that shit.  My fiance's dad got yelled at for doing it.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Which one?  Yeah, I don't like that.  The one that, I don't know. 
[00:59:00]  Her dad, not her stepdad.  All the dads were there, too.  I was wondering if that was going to get weird.  But it wasn't weird.  Yeah.  It is weird when dads show up.  Yeah.  Well, someone asked protocol for the dads.  Oh.  And I said to somebody, like, look, man.  Well, my brother got, you know, married.  We had a bachelor party at, I think it's called Slate, the pool hall.  And then you could rent, like, a side room, and that's where you get the strippers to  come in.  My dad was getting lap dances, and he didn't know the protocol, so he's just grabbing the 
[00:59:30]  girl.  Oh, no.  He figured, look, he's not stupid.  He's old school.  He figured, look, if there's a girl half naked on my lap, I'm going to take advantage of this  and squeeze some shit.  Yeah.  And we're all looking like, yeah, you should.  You're in your 70s.  Fuck it.  And the big bouncer dude that comes with the girl almost fucking started in with my  dad, which would have been an ugly problem, because my brother has some fucking crazy friends.  Yeah.  But he had to be told to keep his hands off the girls.  Keep your hands to yourself.  I don't like that.  I loved it, though. 
[01:00:00]  I'm like, right on.  It's hilarious.  So I brought that up.  I'm like, protocol is everyone here gets a lap dance.  Yeah, I was just wondering if it was going to be weird for me to get a lap dance while  sitting across from...  For Jens' dad.  Yeah.  He's in cool, though.  Yeah, but the girl's dad, always a little awkward.  Right.  Her father was like, I couldn't believe.  He's like, come on, let's go get a little stinky on our fingers.  I'm like, what?  Stinky.  He said that.  He was like holding his hand up to my nose.  He's like, come on, let's get some stinky on our fingers.  Guess who this is.  Guess who this is.  Yeah, and then your dad is like, ah, fingers. 
[01:00:30]  And then he held up his fist.  He said, man up.  Two fathers really bonded.  I didn't see that interaction.  Some of the fathers got lap dances.  Yep.  Not at all, though.  Not the main father?  Not the birth, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Jerry chose not to have a lap dance.  Who's Jerry?  He's my dad.  Oh, you're dad?  Okay.  Handlebar Jerry.  Handlebar mustache.  We were working.  Who, by the way, is a great guy.  In the end, he's a great guy to talk to.  But we tried.  He just wouldn't go with the lap dance thing. 
[01:01:00]  He kept refusing the girls.  Why was he refusing?  I don't know.  You can't have Sam seeing him like that.  It's embarrassing.  He probably likes weird stuff.  Oh, yeah.  What he probably likes is to put a belt on his neck with a foot in his mouth and jerk off  into his belly button.  Just something totally inappropriate and creepy that he didn't want his son seeing.  On the way home, he said he was just an old man.  He's done with it.  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  Were they totally nude or no?  No.  They had their bottoms on.  Oh, yuck.  Oh, okay.  Their bottoms on.  How was the lap dance? 
[01:01:30]  Did they touch during the lap dance or did they stand 10 feet away?  No, no, no.  They touched.  How was it?  It was good.  Did you get a rod?  A rod?  No.  Why?  You know.  Well, I don't.  What?  You would instantly get a rod in that situation?  If a girl rubs her ass on my fucking cock right, like back forth, back forth, back forth,  back forth, I can fucking shoot.  That's the motion.  Yeah.  I'm surprised you didn't.  Back forth, repeat.  Did, uh, did, uh, was it weird looking at your dad, though, like, looking at girls like 
[01:02:00]  that?  No, because he didn't really do it.  Like, he was just, like, talking to them, like, ha, ha, ha, ha, oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I'm fine.  He snuck a peek at some tits.  Of course he did.  Right in front of his face.  I'm sure he did, but it was, like, every time a girl went over to him, he was just,  like, talking to her like she could have just as easily been his daughter or something  and sent her on her merry way.  We got Sam a lot of lap dancers, and, uh, at one point, one of the, the ugliest girl  in the place decided she needs to sit on my left knee so she could talk to Sam, and I 
[01:02:30]  guess in most instances that would be very sexy.  She was, my leg was fucking killing me.  Was that the girl that we were sending from guy to guy?  Yeah, because she was, fuck, she had a butter face.  Her face was horrendous.  She asked everybody in our party.  I don't think anyone went for it.  I finally was like, all right, somebody else will pay for it.  It was average.  How much are they, 20 bucks?  20 bucks a song.  Yeah.  But they get you for the two.  It's always 20 bucks a song.  They always do it.  They get you for the two, though.  Yeah, they pull it.  That was two songs. 
[01:03:00]  I'm like, what?  You want one more?  You want one more?  They always give you that line.  And I had a friend there who was, like, he'd obviously fallen in love with the first  girl who gave him a lap dance because he was in for three songs.  Oh, jeez.  It just kept going and going.  I was like, he has no idea what he's doing.  And the funny thing is, like, the move is, you know, these girls want to get you into  the champagne room.  Right.  Back in the backpack room.  Where more shit goes on and it costs you a few more bucks.  That'll cost you, like, a fucking C-note back there. 
[01:03:30]  Nothing happens.  No, nothing happens.  I was saying, Anto, that's the line, though.  Like, when you're hanging out with, like, in general, regular people at a bachelor party,  it's accepted to see everyone getting lap dances.  But when you make that move to, like, when she grabs your hand and goes, let's go, you  know, you can't, you just can't.  Did you get one?  What?  I didn't go to the back room, no.  You need a lap dance?  Oh, yeah.  I got lap dances.  Wait, are the lap dances there?  They're there, yeah, in front of you.  Oh, because some places you just have a room where you go to. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, I was right in front of everybody.  Oh, okay.  But they're all trying to get you into the back room.  But you're like, that's the line, though.  Obi was turning down some of the girls at first.  But I was like, you know, I wanted to make sure everybody got at least something.  You want to make sure all parties are guilty.  I hear you.  Guilty men tell no tale.  He's got him again.  He's cornered him.  Now he's trying to tickle him.  But you would look like a scumbag, is what I'm saying, to get up with one of the girls 
[01:04:30]  and she leads you into the back room in front of people that you normally just see at  a barbecue every once in a while.  But the girl, again, you come out with, like, glitter on your face.  Right.  Shit's staying on your nose.  Shit's staying.  You would have gone off into the private room?  Without a doubt.  I would have came on your fucking, on your jacket sleeve.  We all would have been having a good time, but you would have been...  I would have been MIA.  Where's Jim?  He's fucking trying to get, he's trying to come in his pants.  I told the girl who gave Opie the lap dance, because she was asking me who should I go 
[01:05:00]  to next or whatever, blah, blah, blah.  And I pointed to Opie and I was like, well, that guy right there is the one who has the  most money of all of us.  Boy, wouldn't she?  Oh, yeah.  And she wouldn't leave him alone.  She just wouldn't leave me alone.  Yeah, once the vultures come over.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's it.  They smell that money.  And there was also a guy there that, let's just put it this way, Santorum wouldn't like  very much.  No, not at all.  Santorum would have hated one of the people in our party, if you know what I mean.  Homosexual.  And he was, but he was a trooper, because we kept pushing and pushing, and he got a lap 
[01:05:30]  dance.  He ended up getting two.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there was a big laugh going on, and I'm trying to figure out how I can say this.  There was a big laugh going on, because someone asked him if that turned him a little.  And this person said, not in the least.  Yeah, I was talking to him.  Which I don't understand.  I go, I say.  They just don't like the part.  I know, because I'm like. 
[01:06:00]  It's amazing.  I get, I get you're gay, and you're into something else, but you are a guy in the end, and that  doesn't turn you on at all.  You're saying, like, you could see why the guy would love cock, but why can't you?  But why can't you?  Yeah.  But why can't you?  I appreciate it.  Sure.  You're a good-headed cock, but why can't you see how fucking just beautiful  a naked girl is?  I asked him specifically.  I was like, so while that was happening, were you sitting there going, I don't understand  this at all?  Right.  Or were you like, this isn't my thing, but I get it now? 
[01:06:30]  Right.  And he said, I was just sitting there wondering when it would stop, because I was bored.  Wow.  That's the weirdest.  Jesus.  That's boring.  I just can't wrap my head around that.  That's so gay.  Gay.  I could use it in that context, because it is.  Yeah.  Gay.  That's the gayest ever.  Yeah.  And then he told us, like.  Guy's gay.  Super gay.  These women are convinced that they are just the hottest fucking things on earth, and the  certain stripper was trying to literally turn him in that moment.  Oh, yeah.  Like, oh, I think she said, I got gay friends, you're not gay, and was really trying to work. 
[01:07:00]  I guess that would be a huge accomplishment for a stripper, right?  Oh, you don't understand.  It's a home run.  Right.  In the end.  This is a guy who loves Dick.  You don't get that.  In the end, the stripper lost.  Yep.  There was no turning of the gay gentleman.  No.  Dick had to rack it, though, over there.  Everybody was ordering $10 beers, and then going up to the ATM with a $10 surcharge on it.  A $10 charge on the ATM.  Yeah, $10 beers. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  And then the chicks are constantly coming over to just try to rape you for money.  Yeah.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait.  Are you saying that a strip club was overpriced?  Wait a minute now.  Come on, guys.  Let's not.  And then I had my one friend there who was, like, trying not to spend money.  Oh, really?  Where'd you come?  That's not the place you go to be economical.  He kept telling girl after girl that he was broke and didn't have any money.  How much did you...  You had enough money to get a train ticket home. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  That guy.  That's what he said, yeah.  And she was like, where are you from?  And he was like, Connecticut.  And she was like, oh, that's not far.  And he was like, it's a far fucking walk.  That's just a little bit.  Yeah.  He's also, he's got a wedding coming up, too.  He's probably got no money, but, yeah, he didn't want to spend anything.  It was fun, man.  Good time.  They hammered me with my drinks.  I was hungover for the first time and probably since my son was born.  How long were you there for?  I left around one-ish, I guess. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  You guys made it to two, maybe?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I tapped out around one.  Yeah.  Pounding headache when you woke up?  Dude.  I tweeted, hell on earth is simple, being really hungover and having to wake up early  because you got a kid at home.  My kid's almost two.  And he's ready for the fucking world, man.  He's not hungover.  He's ready for the world.  You can't reason with an almost two-year-old.  No.  I was miserable all day yesterday.  I had four hours sleep. 
[01:09:00]  He gets up around 6.  6.30.  And that had to be the day that you had to watch him all day.  And yesterday was the day I had to babysit him all day.  All fucking day.  What, do kids have to be at the office?  What the fuck are they waking up so early in the morning?  You got to sit him down and go, look, this is inconvenient.  Oh, my God.  Explain what inconvenient is.  That's what I should have filmed.  Me trying to reason with him.  And I walked around all day with a pounding headache, just wandering around my neighborhood  going to playgrounds and just trying to survive the day.  Did you want to just go back to bed? 
[01:09:30]  Oh, God.  Did he want you to go back to bed or no?  No.  He didn't think it was nap time?  Oh, God.  He didn't give a shit, did he?  No.  My wife came home around 6, I think.  6 p.m.?  Yes.  It was an all-day thing.  What time did she leave?  10 in the morning.  Oh.  And your kid was probably sleeping, though, until, like, noon.  No.  No.  6.30.  6.30.  He was ready to go.  Now I understand why people stop drinking when they have kids.  You just can't fucking do it.  Some people figure it out, I guess. 
[01:10:00]  But in general, you know, kids...  Kenny told me a long time ago.  Because Kenny used to drink a lot, he told me.  And I go, when did you stop drinking?  He goes, when I had kids, because they don't understand hangovers.  And he just realized, fuck, I can't do this.  Was that the first time you've been hungover with him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  First time I've been hungover since he's been born.  Two years.  My dad didn't realize that.  He was hungover.  And I go in there, he'd be like, shut up.  Don't bust my chops.  Yeah.  Bust your chops.  Yeah.  It was always...  Apparently, I was always breaking his chops or something. 
[01:10:30]  Busting his chops.  I don't even know what that means.  You know how sad my tolerance is?  This is for Anthony.  One beer at Caroline's.  And one Dennis Leary, which is a delicious drink they offer there.  Oh.  And then I had...  And people are going to laugh at me.  Two lousy, strong gin and tonics at the strip club.  That's it.  That was it.  That's what knocked me down.  And you were done for the day.  For the day the next day.  Yeah.  Slow gin fizz.  Oh, God.  Is that your drink?  No, no.  Slow gin fizz.  Is that an old lady's drink?  No.  No, that's more a kid. 
[01:11:00]  It was like a...  Back in the day, it was like a kid-type drink.  This was gin and tonic.  And, you know, they've changed the rules at the strip club.  They used to water down their drinks and shit.  So you spend a lot of money trying to get drunk.  Now their goal is to fucking hammer you.  So you spend all your money on a fucking...  Right.  On dancing.  So they want to hammer you.  So, I mean...  That's where they make their money.  I felt like I was drinking pretty much straight-up gin.  Wow.  Yeah, I felt it, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, because now it's all about getting you back there to pay for the dances.  Because the club gets a cut of that. 
[01:11:30]  I don't...  I don't...  Yeah, I don't miss drinking.  I really don't.  No.  It was fun.  I had a blast.  Don't get me wrong, but I don't...  That hangover shit is...  I'm done with it.  Dude, the drinking part's fun.  Yeah, always.  You can hangover that's bad.  Always.  That's the bad one.  What else happened there, Sam?  I'm trying to remember.  I was wondering if my sister's husband got uncomfortable with my dad being there.  And he's more like a conservative guy, too.  Because he left early out of the strip club.  Who did?  My sister's husband.  And my dad was there.  So I don't know if he's still, like, worried about impressing my dad or something. 
[01:12:00]  Because he wasn't feeling it.  He wasn't feeling it.  He didn't want to be around all the strippers and stuff.  Why?  Because probably he's a pig.  I knew he couldn't control himself.  Probably a pig.  I thought he was afraid one of them would come over and recognize him.  Oh, you want to rub your helmet on my foot for $40 again?  He's been there many times before.  Yeah.  He's got his favorites and everything.  Yeah.  So I guess you're ready to get married now.  That's what happens.  That was the end.  That was the last thing, right?  Where's Jess's bachelorette party, though? 
[01:12:30]  Jess says she wants to, like, get trapeze lessons or something for her bachelorette party.  What the hell is that about?  Dork.  Uh-oh.  From who?  That's what I was saying.  That's what I told her.  Like, first she said she didn't want any strippers whatsoever her bachelorette.  I guess that means I won't be invited.  I'm kidding, Sam.  I don't strip.  I know this.  That means she really wants strippers at a bachelorette party.  Uncut.  You think so?  Uncut.  Yeah, they're going to do that on the QT.  They're going to play the whipped cream game. 
[01:13:00]  She doesn't want to realize the mistakes she's making.  Like, she doesn't want a guy with, like, a fucking real bulge to come over.  Because then she's like, oh, no.  A real bulge.  What am I doing?  That's what they can look like.  I didn't know they grew them like that.  No, I hope there's nothing vulgar going on at her bachelorette party.  I'd be insecure.  How long did it take you to realize that was a small room?  What?  What do you mean?  There's mirrors everywhere.  I thought I was in a giant room. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're like, wait a minute.  That mirror shit works.  Maybe this is, like, 10 by 25.  I thought I was in a warehouse.  It was not much bigger than this room.  Twice the size of this room.  It was a very small place.  I thought it was giant.  They put mirrors, and they also kept the lights very dim.  So you didn't notice all the, you know, stripper juice.  Standard operating procedure.  Smudges all over the windows.  I mean, the mirrors.  Yeah, you don't want to be in a fucking library.  Oh, quick.  I'll be your fucking ass on me near the Dewey decibel system. 
[01:14:00]  Would you be able to recognize one of those strippers outside that place?  I was thinking about that.  I think...  No fucking way.  I think there's one or two I could.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Not by the face.  Come on, you got me.  Keep on doing it.  Oh, boy.  Hello, Josh.  Was it the two that were lezzing out?  I liked seeing that.  Lezzing out.  You did?  I enjoyed seeing that very much, yeah.  I liked a lot of the girls.  For the people that question Sam, he's an old man. 
[01:14:30]  Thank you.  He knows how to handle a fucking lap dance.  Thank you.  Like a fucking champ.  Yeah.  You didn't get a boner?  No, I mean, there was some blood that was rushed down to that area, but not a full-on erection.  Did it leak at all?  I thought of blood leaking out of the...  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  It sounded terrible.  Of course you didn't get a boner.  I leaked blood before I became erect.  Did a little pre-cum come out?  No.  A little sticky leg?  No.  Oh, my God.  It's sticky leg.  But they treated me very well.  I had many lap dances.  That's fun. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, it was fun.  We tried.  Yeah.  That's what the boys are there for.  Would you hate it after Jess's bachelorette party if she said, look, we're going to have  to wear condoms for six more months, even after you're married?  I would be extremely upset by that.  Yeah.  And you've gone in the back room?  None of us really pushed it on you.  Somebody had paid for it?  That's a yes.  I guess.  I mean, yeah?  Why wouldn't you?  Yeah.  If you paid for it.  Yeah, it's the champagne room.  More people on Twitter. 
[01:15:30]  It's not babysitting when it's your kid.  You just don't understand.  You just don't get it.  You differentiate parenting and babysitting.  When you're teaching life lessons, you're parenting.  There are times you're absolutely babysitting your kid, period.  End of discussion.  Like today, I'm not.  I don't like when you say that.  Today, I'm not babysitting my kid.  We'll do a whole bunch of little things today. 
[01:16:00]  We'll go to the playground.  We might go for a bike ride.  We'll do all sorts of fun stuff.  Yesterday, it was babysitting.  I should have got paid.  Holy fuck.  Did he have a lot of energy all day?  Oh, my God.  You weren't in the condition to give him any life lessons.  I so understand when people get a little goon army with their kid.  Come on.  We're going home.  I don't do that.  I want the record.  Nah, I wouldn't do that.  You walked around a lot?  Yeah, you've got to remove yourself from situations. 
[01:16:30]  You have to fucking leave for a little while.  They don't understand.  I understand the goon arm, though.  Goon arm.  Oh, yeah.  Got a goon arm every so...  No, you don't.  I don't think I've...  I've goon-headed once.  Here you go.  Meet the jukebox.  Meet the cigarette machine out by the front door of the bar.  Whoops.  And Club Soda Kenny gave me a big five-a-roonie to put in a lady's G-string, he told me.  Did he call it a five-a-roonie?  No, that's something...  But I felt like it was coming from him. 
[01:17:00]  That's old school, too.  You don't do the G-string thing.  You don't?  No.  What do you put it, like, in the thigh-high?  Just hand it to him.  Right in the vagina.  Here.  Not me.  I try to get in there.  I try to do this to lips.  I didn't see anybody G-stringing in there.  There was one girl who was better than most of them who did...  She extended her G-string for me to place...  Yuck.  Oh, really?  Was it the front part of the G-string so you could get a little peek?  I always try to get down there.  Do a little peek?  You do?  I try to knuckle-walk down the pubis. 
[01:17:30]  Knuckle-walk.  Like an animal.  She was an animal!  Alright.  I guess that's it.  That's a bunch of nude women dancing.  In our laps.  Yeah.  Shicks.  And no lap dances for Jerry.  No, my dad didn't want to lap dance.  He wanted to show Bobby a little respect.  I guess so.  After all these years of marriage.  I guess so.  But he said, he goes...  That's what he said.  He just doesn't even...  He goes, ah... 
[01:18:00]  Doesn't affect him anymore?  He goes, I'm old at this point.  Oh, God.  He's probably so fucking out of control.  You think so?  Yeah, yeah.  He just didn't want to let the fucking...  You know, the gates open.  Yeah.  Release the kraken.  He's got to sit there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, if my son sees me really go off, it's over.  Find my gay friend to talk to for a while.  What do you got going on?  He's just getting a lap dance, but he pulled his cock out.  He's jacking.  He's the one who just starts grabbing and raping. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, God.  There I am.  He doesn't do that.  That's ridiculous.  It's insane.  Your dad?  Yeah.  He probably doesn't like lap dances unless there's a strap-on.  That's his thing.  You think that's what he's into?  Yeah, he likes the bobbing, like a glowing pink strap-on.  I don't think so.  To tickle his stash.  I mean, I guess he wouldn't tell me, but I doubt it.  We should ask him. 
[01:19:00]  He'll probably say no.  Is E-Rock picking up yet?  Stupid E-Rock.  We are going to try to call him every minute today, right?  He's still not picking up.  7.45?  Yeah.  Travis says no, but they keep trying.  And on this one, I trust Travis.  I think he is indeed still trying.  I know Travis is on it.  I have no doubt about that.  Yeah.  All right.  We should play that tape when we get back.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  Anyone who thinks we're crazy and always smashing the media?  No, I don't think a lot of people think that, Jimmy.  But a lot of them do.  A lot of them do, maybe. 
[01:19:30]  You'll always have some, but in general, I think people are with us.  I think we've changed a lot of people's opinion about the media over the years.  I hope so.  Exposing a man.  And I'm proud of that, man, to be honest with you.  Because NBC, they're saying they edited the Trayvon Martin 911 call.  Well, Fox called him out to make it seem like George Zimmerman was racist.  Yeah.  But it's a terrible edit.  You know, I haven't heard the edit yet.  Yeah.  It's probably one of the worst things I've ever heard a news show do.  And it's like, literally, they want a fucking riot. 
[01:20:00]  And they don't even know they want that.  Yeah.  But I thought, like, this is why they're not fucking covering a black-on-white crime motivation.  It's not just that they're closet racist.  It's that there's no payoff for that.  Right.  They're going to annoy black people, but they're not going to get any reaction.  Like, if it's a black-on-white crime, white people aren't going to protest and riot normally.  So, there's nothing for them.  There's no fucking follow-through.  But this, when they show white on black, it gets blacks really upset.  They know that Sharpton and community activists are going to be there. 
[01:20:30]  They know there's going to be protests.  There's a part two to the story.  And they shape the story.  They shape the story.  To make it worse than maybe it is.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Fucking disgraceful.  And you talk about irresponsibility in the media.  You know, stupid radio guys get in trouble for doing an Asian accent or a dumb joke like  I miss or what have you.  But the stuff these guys are doing, I would say, is way the fuck worse than nappy-headed  home.  No, I think I'm more edgy than these guys.  I think I'm a lot more edgy than a lot of these guys. 
[01:21:00]  So, we'll play the tape next.  Do I miss.  And we'll discuss this further.  It's going to annoy you.  I haven't heard it yet.  It's bad, dude.  All right.  Hit it.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Is this Kiss?  Yeah.  Kiss made an appearance on the...  Country Music, right? 
[01:21:30]  Country Music Awards last night.  They looked very out of place.  I was forced to watch that crap.  Because I agreed to live tweet it.  Ugh.  But, uh...  Did they promote me on that?  Because I wasn't involved with that.  Why would they have promoted me?  I think so.  I'm hoping that's a mistake.  I think in the email or something, they said that you were going to live tweet.  That Ant was going to live tweet.  I thought I was in good company.  So, I'm like, all right.  I'll live tweet.  And then I don't see any of you guys.  That was working.  I spent eight hours.  I don't see any of you guys.  Eight hours marathoning. 
[01:22:00]  Jesus.  Game of Thrones.  Game of Thrones.  Game of Thrones.  Isn't it great?  Fucking great.  God damn show is fucking great.  And there's only ten episodes in the first.  So, you can still catch up.  It's a great show, man.  I want to.  That's not my thing either.  Typically, Kings and, you know, any of that type of stuff is not stuff I like.  But the acting is just so good.  The relationships are great.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really cool.  The sex.  Oh, yeah.  You saw The Sex is fucking.  The fidget's great, too.  He's phenomenal.  Really good, man.  I've seen a few episodes, but now I've got to piece them all together. 
[01:22:30]  Because I've seen them out of order.  I'll just catch an episode when I'm in Philly.  I'll catch one over here, over there.  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  You've got to watch from the beginning.  But what I've seen, I really like.  Yeah, you just watch from the beginning.  It's fucking.  Nothing wrong with a show that has a lot of sex.  Fuck.  Yeah, they certainly like throwing in their gratuitous nudity and shit.  Oh, yeah.  It's about the Starks and the Lannisters.  And the Starks.  He's like, yeah, I've got it with that sword.  And Lannisters is like.  Yeah, we got it.  Hey, he's talking short stuff.  Look at us.  And the king's over there like, yeah, what are you doing, king stuff? 
[01:23:00]  Come on for me.  A little incest happening.  Yeah.  Hey, we should promote.  Bill Burr is coming on the show today.  Yes, he is.  He is today?  We love when Bill Burr comes by.  Well, I didn't see that.  What happened?  He's going to be here at 9 o'clock.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Well, on show.  But Bill Burr, 9 o'clock.  All right.  I'm starting to become a fan of his podcast.  Bill Burr is very funny.  I mean, I'm becoming a fan of Jay Moore's podcast.  Jay Moore does a really good job. 
[01:23:30]  I'm like, wow, I wish we could get that Jay Moore on our show.  He's very focused.  Very focused on his podcast.  Very focused on his podcast.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like, where's the ADD when you're doing your podcast?  That's because it's his podcast.  And now this will get back to Jay.  Are you being trash?  No, not at all.  Not trash.  Jay and very good friends.  But he approaches it differently when he does our show, I guess.  My good friend, Jay Moore.  I like the ADD shit.  But he doesn't really do that with his own podcast.  He's like really focused.  What does he do on the podcast? 
[01:24:00]  The one I just listened to was the Alonzo Bowden one.  Oh, he's comedians.  Okay.  And wow, Alonzo's good, man.  Yeah.  I've always thought he was funny.  I don't think we've ever had him on the show for whatever reason.  And he seems to know a little bit about everything.  He's a car fanatic.  Is he?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  I don't know if he buys them or not.  I don't know.  He might make the money to have a collection.  They didn't really talk cars for the most part.  A little bit here and there.  But yeah.  But yeah. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, so Bill Burr will be here at 9 o'clock.  Bill just does it by himself.  Oh, yeah.  He just fucking goes off about shit.  It's funny, man.  Just by himself.  Really funny.  There's a bitterness.  How long is an hour?  Yeah.  Yeah, to the people that are podcasting, do not do more than an hour.  You're crazy.  I got so many podcasts I can't even listen to because, you know, those hours start adding  up.  Like Penn Jillette's was an hour and 42.  He kind of lost me in his.  Not in a bad way.  I mean, he's very talented, obviously, but I need an hour. 
[01:25:00]  Hour is perfect.  Definitely.  Yeah.  An hour works very well.  Very well.  Most people are in the car for an hour, whether it's an hour straight or a half hour and then  a half hour later.  And you could you can knock these podcasts off.  Yeah.  Ah, NBC edited the Trayvon Martin 911 call to make it seem like George Zimmerman was racist.  Really?  Yeah.  Yes, they did.  And their dicks are fucking swinging in the wind.  They're doing an internal investigation.  Really?  To see what happened? 
[01:25:30]  Are they?  There's no bias, though.  I mean, we're crazy.  There's no bias in the media.  It's only Fox.  You guys are right.  Get a load of this.  You want to play the other tape?  This is scary shit.  Because it could happen to any of us.  It could happen to any fucking person.  What do you mean it could?  It did.  It has.  Well, I mean me.  It didn't happen to me.  What was the what was the one clip they used during the Homeless Charlie thing?  It was Ant.  Right.  But it was out of context.  It was like, holy fuck.  Seriously?  It made it way worse than it was.  Speaking of Homeless Charlie, I saw him. 
[01:26:00]  He was out at Caroline's Friday night.  He was outside.  I told him, come down.  Well, I was signing merch and he came down and we talked.  He's doing well.  Oh, there you go.  You got a picture of him.  Yeah, I photographed so terribly there.  Well, no, because you're very white.  He's dark.  But it was good to talk to him.  Stupid E-Rock will take that picture and make you look really weird.  Yeah.  E-Rock's done it to a few of my pictures.  It's like, oh, I figured I would fix the tones a little bit.  Well, that happens when you photograph with black people.  I know.  It does sound like really weird.  Is E-Rock picking up yet? 
[01:26:30]  Is E-Rock.  There's still no E-Rock, really?  Yeah, man.  Well, it's only E-02.  He's probably sleeping in.  Why think of the show?  You go to a big event like WrestleMania, why would you check into the show you work for?  Unless he's on a 6 o'clock flight.  I doubt he would have a big WrestleMania night and then get up at a 6 o'clock flight.  We called him five minutes ago.  He didn't answer.  He's going to fly nice, like 2 or 3 this afternoon.  He's going to sleep in.  He's going to get a little fucking room service.  Yeah, sure.  A few snacks on the way to the airport. 
[01:27:00]  He's taking his time, for sure.  Come on.  A Cinnabon while he's at the airport waiting for his flight.  Imagine if you wore that shirt to WrestleMania.  People would think you were the shirt.  Would they really?  Yeah.  S.S. McMahon.  I don't even get it.  They wouldn't know who it was.  Oh, that's the famous shirt.  Yeah.  From, what's his name?  It's in perfect condition.  It's a little wrinkled because it was in a thing, but it's an amazing shirt.  If I saw somebody wearing that shirt, I would immediately know it was Shane McMahon, because  it says, especially at a wrestling show.  Yeah.  I would tell.  All right.  Let's do this.  So, the Zimmerman thing, what NBC did.  This is scary, man. 
[01:27:30]  Radio guys get in trouble all the time for being irresponsible, but this is way the fuck  worse.  There's going to be riots over this fucking thing, so you've got to be careful how you  report this.  Just give the facts.  Don't spin it.  You have to be careful.  And Hannity, whether you like him or not, did a great job.  Anyone out there that doesn't like Hannity on this one, he did a phenomenal job.  So, they were 100% right to call NBC out.  All right.  Let's play this.  So, what are we about to hear?  Does Hannity set it up at all?  Yes.  Hannity does a little setup.  First, it's NBC playing the edited clip, and then they play right after that how it 
[01:28:00]  was in context.  Who on NBC?  I think it was on the Today Show.  Jesus.  They edited the clip.  Yeah.  It's probably some fucking production guy backstage, though.  Is that Matt Lauer's show?  Matt Lauer is the host, yeah.  Sarah Palin is going to be hosting that show.  Matt Lauer.  Why would Sarah Palin host it?  Well, Katie Couric is hosting.  That's stupid.  I saw that movie about Sarah Palin.  It was actually pretty good with Ed Harris, and Julianne Moore was amazing.  She was hot, too.  Yeah.  Julianne Moore.  Julianne Moore's hot. 
[01:28:30]  Especially with Sarah Palin.  I'm trying to think about that for a second.  A lot of freckles.  I saw her in that weird lesbian movie.  No, no, no, no, no.  What was that movie?  The Kids Are Alright.  Yeah, The Kids Are Alright.  When she was lezzing out the whole movie.  Lezzing out.  Was she ever hot?  Boogie Nights.  I'd have to see a picture.  Julianne Moore was sexy in Boogie Nights, and she was fucking amazing as Sarah Palin.  She's not a pig or anything, but...  No.  Yeah.  I thought the movie made Sarah kind of look like a dumb twat, but it made McCain look  like a really nice guy.  But Sarah, she is a dumb twat. 
[01:29:00]  Why do we think she's smart?  I don't think she's smart, but I...  She knows how to work the media, so I'll give her credit for that.  She's charismatic.  But they didn't...  There's things behind the scenes that really annoy you about her, like the way she didn't  prepare for that.  Because even her, the old chief of McCain's campaign, Steve something, thought that Katie  Cork was fair in the interview.  She wasn't unfair.  Sarah was just unprepared.  Of course.  Let's play this.  And we're going to play the edited portion first, then we're going to put in what they 
[01:29:30]  missed, which gives it an entirely different meaning.  This is NBC News, Brent, and this is what they did at a time where emotions are running  very high in this country.  Watch this.  This guy looks like he's up to no good.  He looks black.  Did you see what he was wearing?  Yeah.  A dark hoodie.  This case drew national attention after 9-1-1 tapes were released from the night...  So what did we just hear there?  He said, this guy looks like he's up to no good. 
[01:30:00]  He looks black.  And then the guy goes, the 911 dispatcher goes, do you see what he was wearing?  He goes, I look like he was wearing a hoodie.  So he said, this guy looks like he's up to no good.  He looks black.  And then the guy says, what are you wearing?  He goes, I look like he's wearing a hoodie.  Yep.  That's what NBC played.  Edited.  Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot and killed Martin, an unarmed teenager.  Are you following him?  Yeah.  Okay, we don't need you to do that.  Martin's family says the problem with all of that is that police accepted Zimmerman's  statements as the scene as fact and never gathered any more evidence that might reveal 
[01:30:30]  what really happened then.  This guy looks like he's up to no good or he's on drugs or something.  It's raining and he's just walking around looking about.  Okay, and this guy, is he white, black or Hispanic?  He looks black.  Holy shit.  Did you see what those fucking scumbags did?  Unbelievable.  Holy shit.  How unbelievable is that?  I'm not even saying he's right to shoot him, but the tone of one is so much different. 
[01:31:00]  Oh my god.  He looks like he's on drugs.  He's looking about.  Yeah.  He's much different than he gave more detail.  And then he was asked what the race was.  He was asked what the race was.  Not, he looks like he's in trouble.  He's in trouble.  He looks black.  Those fucking scumbags at NBC.  Wow.  That should be criminal, man.  That should be.  That should be criminal.  You're absolutely right.  Because it makes him sound like he's obsessed with the fact that he's black.  He wasn't, he didn't even say black until he was asked what he was.  That's, that's a big difference.  Huge.  It's like he was concentrating or just, just fixated on the race. 
[01:31:30]  That's what it sounded like.  Like, ah, he's up to no good.  He's black.  It's like, no, he was asked.  Right.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a bad one.  I think so.  Ah, we got the Jay Moores on the line.  Ah, Mr. Moores.  Yo, yo.  Sitting here in my hoodie factory, son.  Oh, shit.  I was just giving you props on your podcast, Jay Moores.  Yo, I appreciate that, my homeboy.  You know what I'm saying?  Me and my niggas try to keep that shit gutted.  Keep it real, real, son. 
[01:32:00]  I tie that shit tight so only my eye holes be peeping out.  No more see my motherfucking nose.  Tie that shit tight.  Word, Don.  You can't tell if I got a beard and motherfucking mustache when I got more of these tights.  That's my word.  And my podcast is the truth.  Me and Pilbara.  I don't know who these motherfucking pussies are on the top ten.  We're going to knock these niggas off, knock these niggas out.  You know what I'm saying?  Wouldn't it be fun to just talk like that all the time in society?  No wonder people are going black, man.  This shit is fun as fuck. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  I'm at home alone holding my dick talking like this, man.  What's Jay Moore up to?  I'm just looking at the top ten on iTunes going, who the fuck are these motherfuckers, man?  T.J. Miller and Cash and fucking Febreze and all these motherfuckers.  What happened to Jay Moore and Bill Burr up in that top ten in that bitch, son?  We got a record of what happened to these motherfucking pussies, kid?  It is bad.  You got to keep up on that shit. 
[01:33:00]  Test these nuts, motherfuckers shit.  You don't let these motherfuckers take over.  You only got no love for the road.  Oh, man.  You're doing great, though.  Yeah.  I see.  You're up there.  I can hear Anthony reaching for his pistol right now.  You're up there all the time.  Come on.  No, I haven't been in the last two weeks.  I've not been in the top ten.  What?  It's new asshats.  What?  There's always new asshats.  Look it up right now, and you'll know the new people, and you'll go, what is this?  Oh, man.  New kids on the block, yo.  I listened to Bill Burr. 
[01:33:30]  I listened to last night.  I listened to Bill Burr's rant on nerds.  Right.  Oh, my God.  It's fucking amazing about how nerds are, like, cool now.  Yeah.  Making fun of the Big Bang Theory.  Leave it to, like, the Big Bang Theory.  Have a show about autism and make it a comedy.  That's so true.  You could tell they're nerds.  Look at their shirts.  Like, what?  Yeah, I know.  They were here on YouTube when they played Big Bang Theory without a laugh track.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's so uncomfortable.  It's really, like, most alarming. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Like, they do it kind of with every show, but with Big Bang Theory, it's alarming because  they have Asperger's or something.  I get angry when that show comes on, and I've had the channel on, you know, maybe Seinfeld  was on or something, and then that show comes on.  I get angry.  I'm just like, ah, I can't get the remote fast enough.  Turn it off.  That laugh track.  Anthony's Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds.  Yes.  And I'm Ted McGinley.  Ted McGinley.  Yes.  Fucking Ted Rolls.  Freylander's running television.  That stupid laugh track has fucked up some comedies, man. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Makes it easy.  They had one on the Flintstones, Hope.  You know?  Did they really?  Oh, God, yeah.  It's the worst.  I hate the Flintstones more than I've ever hated another show.  But isn't it, like, cartoony and just, like...  Stinks.  It never sounded like a real, like, laugh track, right?  No, it's a real, uh, laugh track.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  It's a regular old laugh track, yeah.  I don't remember that.  Yeah, it was bad.  Flintstones blew.  Hey, Jay, who's that...  I remember, as a kid, I was so stupid.  I was like, how do they get people into that cartoon audience? 
[01:35:00]  That is stupid.  Who's going to be on your next podcast?  God, I just choked my coffee.  That's so funny.  That is stupid.  Matt Paxton's up right now.  Your buddy.  Yeah, Matt's great, man.  He's a good man.  And you know what?  When I first had him on, he was singing your praises, like, a year ago.  We all just lap each other's assholes.  It's amazing.  We're all just...  We just gotta.  Making out with asses.  He's the hoarder guy, by the way, for the people that didn't make the connection.  Bloarders.  I prefer bloarders to hoarders. 
[01:35:30]  Animal bloarders than...  I like animal hoarders, bloarders, and hoarders.  What's a bloarder?  Black hoarder.  Oh, yeah, you don't see...  Well, you do see a lot of those, I guess.  Not as many as white.  My wife goes, wait, is that somebody that hoards black people?  I said, yes, that's exactly right.  Exactly.  Hey, Jay Moore, as we talked about the Knicks recently, me and you, private conversation.  What do you think now with the Jeremy Lin out?  Here we come, H-seed.  Here we come, same as last year.  You know, it's interesting that the coaching staff seems a little comfy that he decided to 
[01:36:00]  get surgery, like they think he's a puss.  Oh, they think he should play it out?  Yeah.  Walk it off, dick.  Put a brace on and fucking run it out.  But people have to understand, this guy doesn't have a big contract yet.  Yeah.  He's got to be very careful, because if he blows out the knee where it ends your career,  he never made the money.  The guy was sleeping on the fucking couches a mere month ago.  He's going to be back there.  Calm down.  You're in hysteric. 
[01:36:30]  You're in hysteric.  And I heard on your podcast, I didn't know this.  I learned things from Jay Moore's podcast.  He was educational.  He was sleeping on his brother's couch, this Jeremy Lin, right?  And then Jeremy Lin's brother had company and had to tell his brother, beat it, stupid.  And then he went to what's-his-name's couch, right?  Landry, I can't play in the fourth quarter.  My life's dependent on the field.  Yeah.  He didn't tell him he was to let the kid start.  He played about four minutes, and then he'd pull him and just say,  you go get a hot dog or something.  You know, you're done.  You're done for that. 
[01:37:00]  He could be three for three.  It is free throw.  Just sit him on the bench.  Same with Woodson.  He can't see the court.  Four shots a game.  Meanwhile, J.R.  Smith's 0 for 11 and 0 for 4 in his free throws.  He plays 40 goddamn minutes.  Yeah, but J.R.  Smith's a gangster.  Yeah, but I don't need a gangster out there.  We did that already in 96.  You know what I mean out there?  I need ballplayers.  Oh, yeah.  Your Oakley take was good, too.  Yeah.  This means nothing to anyone.  J.R.  He knows a lot about sports.  People don't like the fucking basketball talk, I guess,  but I enjoyed your Oakley. 
[01:37:30]  Let's really isolate people.  First of all, Doug Waite.  We can blame Doug Waite for the downfall,  for the downfall of the Islanders.  Because if you remember, when I hooked the NHL Awards,  I said, you're the coach.  What specifically can we blame on you?  And he said, power play.  I'll be in charge of power play.  And, well, they suck balls.  So, O.P., you should film throwing your tickets in the river again.  Well, I mean, I thought they should have fired the fucking coach,  but whatever.  Doug Waite coach.  Hockey and basketball talk. 
[01:38:00]  What else?  Why don't we talk about the World of Warcraft and really talk about it?  I know.  I'm a blood elf female, and I roll with the horde.  Yeah, you probably relate to more people that way.  The gamer tag is your mom's box 11.  All I'm saying about the Jay Moore is he always has a very good take  on sports, which is very different and very real.  My take on the next is, in a nutshell,  it's the same as the L.A. Kings.  Something about putting that uniform on turns you into a mope. 
[01:38:30]  A mope?  Like, you look at the L.A. Kings' lines, and you go,  this team should be a fucking three seed, not national.  Like, how the fuck are the Kings so bad with Dustin Brown and, you know,  Carter and Penner and all these?  Penner won a Stanley Cup.  He has six goals.  How would you fuck you a grown man with six goals?  Hey, what the fuck?  You might get a piece of fucking property out of this, Henry.  I have to dial it back.  My kid's sleeping five feet from me.  I'm sitting here doing Pesci impressions next to the crib.  Poor guy.  Yeah, I can't really yell. 
[01:39:00]  No.  What do you do?  A little fella.  A little fella.  A little fella.  A little fella.  Oh, and you stood up for Dane Cook in your last podcast.  I liked seeing that.  It's so easy just to hate on Dane Cook for some reason,  but you've got to break it down sometimes.  He works very hard, and he's a comic, and he's out there, like, fucking trying.  And, you know, I said, I started to say it on the Gary Goldman podcast,  and we never got to it, so I came full circle on the Alonzo Bowden podcast,  and Jimmy may or may not agree with this, middle acts of ruining comedy. 
[01:39:30]  Because when we were coming up, and we were middles, and we were hungry and pissed up,  we would just meet at the olive tree, and we would just talk shit about everybody,  but then we would just go do our work.  We didn't have a fucking blog and a Twitter account to bring everybody down like crabs in a barrel.  Like, you got fucking bumped, T.J. Miller.  Suck balls.  Kiss my dick.  That's how it goes.  Yeah, what happened with T.J. and Dane?  Like, I know he badmouthed.  He got bumped, and he wrote a blog.  He said, explaining how bad Dane's set was, and how it was misogynistic, 
[01:40:00]  and then he took certain bits and printed them in his blog, like,  he said he wanted to chainsaw fuck a pussy and make it look like a roast beef sandwich,  and he wanted to hate fuck strip.  And it's like, did you just write a blog criticizing another comic's act?  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Yeah, that's a little...  The fucking cop in Yogi the Bear?  That's a little rough.  Especially if you say a guy stinks, and you write his acting, that stinks, that's one thing. 
[01:40:30]  I wouldn't even do that.  But if you write about a guy in a tone that is probably trying to get him to get shit for what he's saying,  that's a different vibe.  Plus the fact that should be mentioned, Dane was just working on new material, too.  Yeah.  Which all you guys do, you go to these clubs on a Tuesday or whatever the fuck,  and you're working out stuff and trying to figure out how it's going to work,  and you develop it.  And T.J. Miller should have known that.  Yeah, critique that.  What's the problem?  And hasn't Dane earned the route to go to the lab factory on an off night, on a Wednesday, 
[01:41:00]  and do an hour?  Hasn't he earned that?  Yeah, I mean, dude, we all get bumped.  It is what it is.  It's part of fucking performing.  You're going to get bumped.  Jimmy, you and I still get bumped.  I mean, but that's just how who gives a fuck.  Yeah, we've had T.J. Miller on the show, and he seemed like a pretty nice kid,  but this is really disappointing that he would do this.  It fucking, believe me, if I'm at the cellar and Seinfeld walks in,  or Chappelle or any of those guys, sometimes they'll go up after you as a courtesy,  but other times if they want to just get on, they just go on. 
[01:41:30]  There's nothing I can do about it.  Imagine you on your website, Jimmy, writing a blog about Seinfeld bumping you  and not even being that good.  I would write the blog about how awful I am and how I deserve to be bumped,  and I wish I was more famous.  It's bananas to me.  And for the record, I never mentioned his name on the podcast  because I didn't want to further.  That's okay.  We have no listeners, so it's okay you mentioned it here.  Plus, you did mention it here.  I thought, I hope he said it. 
[01:42:00]  No, you did.  You actually did.  You slipped.  Fucking tricked me a prick.  Yeah, I'm a fucking prick.  Yeah.  So, anyway, I just thought it was like stealing almost because Dane's out there working hard  and working, not to sound totally fruity, but using his powers for good.  And then you use a blog and use Dane.  The only reason I know who he is is because he used Dane's name.  So, it's like that stealing.  Like, you took a piece of Dane and put it in your bullshit blog, and now I watch.  Now my fucking Twitter's going to light up with you. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know that.  You know what, everybody?  I don't really give a shit.  I have two kids and a house at the scoreboard.  I don't know how else.  You know, what do you want me to do?  I would say as a comic, I would never under any circumstances make it my business to blog  or to speak publicly about another guy's intent.  Like, if I'm on stage and a guy bumps me, if Chris Rock bumps me and goes on and just  insults everybody and clears the room, I can be mad that I got bumped and I can think 
[01:43:00]  he was a dick, but I can't go out and go, why would he say those things?  Yeah, yeah.  If a comic goes up and literally walks up and says, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, I may  not like it, but I'm not going to try to get him in trouble for it.  Hilarious.  It certainly is.  Everyone would think he was talking to them.  Of all the things, that's the thing you wouldn't like.  Come on, Jay.  Well, no, I'm just saying.  I'm just saying something that would offend you.  I'm not my cup of tea.  Yeah, I don't go for that type of stuff.  So, anybody that tweets me saying I was too hard on TJ, I can just say, hey, man, talk 
[01:43:30]  to Jimmy Norton.  I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Cunt, cunt, cunt.  Because I like TJ and I feel, it's like, why would you do that, bro?  It's like, again, you can think a guy sucks because that's a head-to-head criticism,  but to take material and go, well, look what he said is fucking scary, man.  Like, comics shouldn't do that shit to each other.  Because, once again, he knows that Dane was working out shit to begin with.  Because his audience members...  That wasn't his polished material, ready for Madison Square Garden.  Bobby Lee got bumped that night.  Not a word.  Well, you know.  Hmm. 
[01:44:00]  He probably didn't know he got bumped.  He was probably walking around the back with his pants down.  Fucking putting his dick in a game hen.  Fucking creep.  He was humping a small game hen.  He is a game hen.  He's a chicken hawk.  And I'm going to eat you.  So, yeah, I try not to...  Because I'm misogynistic on stage.  And I expect some fucking fat chick blogger to get upset.  But if another comic had the nerve to fucking criticize me publicly,  I would never stop going after him.  Ever. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  More importantly, though, everyone looked up...  They looked up some stats, Jay Moores.  The Islanders' power play was eighth in the league.  Oh, thank God.  Dougie Waite should be head coach.  So, Dougie Waite did his job.  Which goes back to my point that they should have fucking fired Capiano a long time ago.  Oh, right.  Your medical opinion means nothing.  That's it for Anthony.  I love that shit.  Then you admit your hockey knowledge is zilch.  No, you're facts. 
[01:45:00]  Joe, the power play was eighth in the league.  Joe.  These kids skate hard.  There's no goddamn Americans on the team, right there?  Poor baby.  It sounds like Harvey Keitel.  Oh, it is Chip.  Is that Chip?  Yeah, who do you think it is?  Oh, boy.  My favorite thing of all time is when I even mention Chip.  And Colin goes, oh!  He gets so pissed off. 
[01:45:30]  He literally clutches his chest.  Hates Chip.  But he loves Chip.  But it was just us alone in a room.  And he went, oh, like he was having a heart attack.  It wasn't for anyone.  He needs Chip.  Colin needs Chip.  You think so?  Obi, great tweets last night.  Country Music Awards.  And Reba McIntyre, when their face is going to fall, looks like she's been staring at the tip of her nose.  Oh, thank you.  She's a cross-eyed bitch.  I didn't know what to do with that, I'll be honest with you.  I was asked to live tweet, and I had a tough time, so I just went after Reba the whole fucking night. 
[01:46:00]  Reba?  You might as well.  Yeah.  She's America, sweetheart.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Maybe years ago.  Jesus.  Well, I just wanted to call and plug my podcast and say that Bill, I know Bill Burr's coming in, right?  Yeah, 9 o'clock.  Did you know we were talking about it?  Because I was just saying how great your podcast was.  I did not.  I called out of the fucking blue to rip myself.  I called because my podcast wasn't in the top ten. 
[01:46:30]  I said, maybe, you know, the boys, I'd get a jolt from these pests if they're still around.  Let's see what happens.  But I'm glad Bill's coming in because Bill is one of the reasons I started a podcast.  Because when I listened to Bill's podcast, it motivated me because it was so good.  Oh, good.  I did say, and I don't want it to be twisted, that you seem very focused on your podcast.  You're very focused and in control.  It's very ADD, but I write shit down.  No, it's not ADD.  You're ADD when you come in here, and that works, too.  Don't get me wrong, because that's where they're going to fucking twist this shit. 
[01:47:00]  But on your podcast, you're extremely focused.  That's what you want on the radio?  You crying?  That's your hello to the world?  Really?  Why don't you stand up by yourself like a man?  God, he's beautiful.  I wish you guys could see this guy.  Let me take care of my child.  I love you guys.  I'll see you soon.  All right, Jay.  Let's do pirate radio again.  Somebody go on vacation when I come into town, okay, honey?  Yeah, I'll figure it out.  Okay.  Yeah, I'll fucking take care of you later.  Disgusting with the two of yous.  You, too. 
[01:47:30]  Always you, too.  See ya.  All right.  Jay Moore, 37, on Twitter, and let's not forget about the podcast he's doing.  I can't wait for his latest episode.  I'm like a fan of podcasts all of a sudden.  What, did you break your pod?  Oh, boy.  It has to be put in a cast, right?  Oh, boy.  That's what they do.  And someone complaining that it's super old news.  Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa smashed T.J. Miller on their podcast.  Well, maybe not everyone's listening to that podcast, and we haven't really discussed it  on our show.  So there's our opinion on the whole fucking thing. 
[01:48:00]  Did anybody hear, and a lot of people don't care about this, that fucking Fedor signed with  the UFC?  Did Dana, Bob is texting me that.  Is that just a rumor?  They said it was on Dana's...  I thought he already signed with you.  How did that work out before then, when the whole thing...  Wait.  What?  What are you talking about?  Fedor Milenko?  Yeah.  Oh, UFC.  He's called up to fight a championship.  And apparently, someone said Dana was Twittering that Fedor signed with UFC.  He never signed with UFC. 
[01:48:30]  Some people don't care about that, but a lot of people do.  But wasn't he fighting in the UFC?  Never.  Because of a merger or something?  No.  He was with Strikeforce and he left.  Right.  He was with Strikeforce.  That's what I was saying.  All right.  I can't remember which one it was.  Hopefully, he's still got some gas in the tank for the UFC.  That would be nice to see.  Let's get back to that audio.  So, NBC.  Yeah.  Want to play that clip again?  Yeah.  So, NBC.  Why don't we start this over again with Sean Hannity?  Because this is pretty amazing what NBC did to this clip. 
[01:49:00]  Making Mr. Zimmerman sound a bit obsessed with race.  With the race.  Where racial angle are those?  I'm not going to say racist, but a bit obsessed with what his race was.  When he didn't even mention it.  They asked him what his race was.  And he said black.  And then they put the edit in there to make it sound like he brought up race.  And he was obsessed with the race.  Yeah.  Part of the story.  Hit this again to refresh everyone's memories.  What they did is, in the first one, they said the guy looked like he's up to no good. 
[01:49:30]  Edit.  He looks black.  That's right there.  That's good.  Yeah.  But they forgot the dispatcher's question.  How could NBC News in good conscience do that?  Yeah, Sean, this isn't distortion.  This isn't bias.  This isn't distortion.  This is an all-out falsehood by NBC News.  And let me say it again.  A falsehood by NBC News.  What they did was, in the first clip, when you hear him say he looks black, anyone watching that believes there are racial overtones to what this man did. 
[01:50:00]  How could you not believe that?  You believe it.  It goes with the narrative of the profiling.  The only problem is, they edited out the dispatcher asking him, what does he look like?  The reason he said it.  And then he says he looks black.  And then he answered the question.  And to edit that out is so distorting.  All right, let me go to one last thing.  George.  It really is.  It's fucking horrendous that they would do that.  It's disgusting.  They are making...  You know what they are?  Here's what the news is.  The media has become the equivalent of the fire bug who fucking lights a fire, calls the fire department, and then stands there and watches it burn. 
[01:50:30]  That's what they have become.  They are fucking pyromaniacs.  You're right.  They start it, they fucking scream about it, and then they just watch.  Yeah.  They're fucking horrible, man.  And don't you think that's way worse than saying nappy-headed hoe on the fucking radio?  It's not even in the same...  It's unbelievable.  This is way worse.  Man, that ain't even a ballpark.  They should lose their fucking...  Because they have this free reign, the media, with content, because of the news, they're supposedly doing a service. 
[01:51:00]  They're fucking despicable, man.  Yeah.  How does anyone do that and not think it's going to be a problem?  I'm telling you, that's why...  Fuck all my theories about race.  That's why they don't report fucking black on white with racial overtones, because it's not going to serve their purpose.  White on black will upset black people enough, and they're trying to get something going.  Yeah.  They are trying to get violence started, and they don't even know they're doing it.  They don't sit around and go, hey, let's... 
[01:51:30]  It's like they all understand.  Like, hey, man, it looks like a black guy got shot by this.  Yeah, I know, I know.  But they both fucking know.  They both know that the L.A. riots are in their fucking minds.  24 hours of coverage.  Something to talk about.  A thing happening.  Where is this huge presence with Reverend Al and Jesse and everything?  Oh, the fact that 14 people in Florida were shot, two killed, including, like, a child that was shot in the leg.  And at a wake, at someone's wake... 
[01:52:00]  How many people died?  Two.  Two people died.  Fourteen shot.  Fourteen shot.  And, again, I mean, this is the biggest part of the problem, as far as gun violence goes in the black community, is black-on-black crime like this.  Black-on-black murder.  Black-on-black shootings.  Black-on-black shootings, to have the...  Even if this is exactly like the NAACP and all the left-leaning news says it is, and this Zimmerman guy was a horrible racist, and he shot this kid for no reason at all, 
[01:52:30]  it still doesn't amount to a huge problem that happens on a daily basis like this.  This is one of these instances that happen that people go, well, again, we show the racism that is America.  No, it's a single instance.  Meanwhile, you've got people getting mowed down in inner cities like Chicago and Baltimore, Detroit, and then you have right here, right in Florida, Miami, this, you know, a fucking six-year-old girl has to turn around and actually has to know how to say, 
[01:53:00]  Grandma, I've been shot.  Because that's like...  Black people are not going to...  It's a terrible thing, but they're not going to possibly become violent and riot over that like they will over a story like this is what the media wants.  They don't give a fuck about a black girl being shot by a black guy.  That's not interesting. 
[01:53:30]  Any more than they care about a black kid being missing on the news.  Oh, yeah.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't give a fuck.  The press...  They go for what would make a better story.  Period.  They always have, too.  But even the organizations that come out, like Reverend Alice, all on top of this shit, and I don't even mean him because he's a fucking idiot, but just the organizations, NAACP, I mean, this is a much bigger, much more obvious, this problem needs to be addressed.  Because he only wants to play the hits.  Yeah, yeah.  In radio terms, he just wants to play the hits.  Right. 
[01:54:00]  Why go for a deep track when you could go for the hit?  And I'll bet you they would go there if the spotlight was there.  Of course they would.  If the media spotlighted horrible things, like people being shot at a wake, Sharpton and Jesse would show up, and then it would get national attention, and people would go, what the fuck?  But again, that's not the story, man.  It's not a good enough story like the Zimmerman, Trayvon one is.  Like, they want justice in this, and it's exposing the racism, and they're doing a race in America thing on CNN, and all this comes up.  When, meanwhile, this is an isolated incidence when you talk about another race on black crime, whether it's white, whether it's Hispanic, whether it's both with this guy. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  I don't know.  But the black-on-black shootings, it's unbelievable how many of these happen on a daily, on an hourly basis.  Can I say something?  Sure.  Holla.  Yeah.  Holla.  Holla that.  Someone's saying that that was edited for time purposes.  Oh, bullshit.  Shit.  Let me talk to Jay in Jersey.  Why would you know something like that? 
[01:55:00]  Are you an editor, or do you work in the media?  No, it just sounds like, I mean, it sounds like maybe a mistake edit for time purposes.  That it incites, it sounds, I mean, I don't know why you guys are making such a mistake.  Dude, listen, even if he was trying to edit for time, you don't think looking at that, because when they edit for time, they still need context, right?  Right?  Yeah, but...  Well, you don't think that that guy would look at that clip and go, you know, I need to edit for time, but holy shit, this is changing the entire context. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, that's a problem.  There's got to be a responsibility there.  If you call yourself the news, by the way.  Do you really believe that?  Do you really believe that there was no intent to play that a certain way when that was edited?  Do you really think that was innocently done?  Can I ask you another question?  No, no, let me, yes, but let me ask you that one first.  Yeah, answer it.  I don't know what that editor's intentions were, but to me it doesn't sound like, no, it didn't sound like somebody...  Yeah, but hold on, you don't know what the editor's intention was, but all these places have what's called a news director that has to oversee all this shit. 
[01:56:00]  So shouldn't he have made a decision, went, whoa, this changes the whole fucking thing?  Yeah, I mean, somebody, clearly somebody fucked up, somebody made a mistake, but that it doesn't change the story, and everybody...  We're attacking the media.  It, of course, changes the story, because it makes Zimmerman sound like, and look, I don't give a fuck...  Everybody else thinks that Zimmerman's a racist anyways, everybody that heard the whole 9-1-1. 
[01:56:30]  Uh, well, it doesn't help when you make it sound like Zimmerman was obsessed with race and brought up the fact that he was black, when, in fact, the original clip shows that he didn't mention race at all until they asked.  The media, dude, that's a big fucking difference.  I can't believe you don't see that, Jeff.  I can't believe you don't...  The media is attempting to create and mold the story that they want, and whether or not...  I don't know what Zimmerman's motives were, and I'm sure it will come out.  If he should go to jail, he'll go to jail.  And maybe Zimmerman is a racist.  I don't know, but you don't need to help it along if you're the news. 
[01:57:00]  Or at least not by...  Dude, can you not see how...  I agree with you that...  Jay's leaning forward.  If it was done on purpose...  Of course...  My hatred, I agree with you that it was the wrong thing to do.  I just don't...  I'm not positive, like you guys, that it was done on purpose.  Okay, well, then I...  What question were you going to ask?  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  I forgot now, but...  But let me ask you a question.  Honestly, I'm going to guess unequivocally.  And I'm not attacking liberals, but I'm going to guess that absolutely you are liberal. 
[01:57:30]  I guess people would consider me liberal, yeah.  Okay, well, you are.  Just say you are.  I'm not a Democrat.  I don't align myself with politicians.  Yeah.  I guess you could call myself a liberal.  But then what...  Dude, how can you not see that editing that call was not done for time?  Like, how can you really think...  The way that changed the meaning...  That's almost like saying...  That's almost like saying this.  If I...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  If I...  If an intruder...  If they say that I call 911, I say, look, an intruder just broke in. 
[01:58:00]  I shot him because he pulled a gun on me.  He was threatening my family.  And they play it.  We're going, an intruder just broke in.  I shot him.  How can you not see the difference that that makes in the edit?  How could you function in our society and not see that?  I can see the difference, but it's not that everybody who watched NBC has some different  opinion than everybody else who heard the full 9-1-1-1.  Yes, they do.  And who cares what their opinion is?  Of course they do. 
[01:58:30]  Do you think everybody that heard the 911 call says, well, he's a racist, 100% of the people?  No, I don't think everyone has that heard, but I think racism has something to do with that as well.  But who cares what people think when you're giving the news, when you're delivering the news as it should be delivered?  Who cares what people think when they hear it?  You don't edit it to try to tell the story that you think will further the news's coverage of it.  You tell the story and let people make up their own minds. 
[01:59:00]  But what this is doing is it's editing because here's what our take, this is what we think it is, and this is how.  It's an absolutely dishonest thing to do.  I agree with you.  If it was done intentionally, that it was.  I'm just not positive that it was done intentionally.  Then I'm sad for you that you cannot see that that edit was done intentionally.  I'm sorry that you function in our society and can't see that particular edit with that particular change of meaning and that particular context removal. 
[01:59:30]  I'm sad for you that you can't see that that was done on purpose, with intent, and with a motive.  It completely changes it.  Can I just point one other thing out that you guys are talking about, that the way that you are trying to make a big deal about why the media doesn't bring attention to black-on-black crime and this and that,  and it's because there's a big difference between someone that gets shot in a robbery or someone that gets shot over some gang thing in a funeral, 
[02:00:00]  than someone, you know, this Zimmerman character, he wasn't trying to rob the kid.  Okay.  It was purely, his motivation was purely, you know.  Listen to yourself.  What was his motivation?  So you think he went out patrolling with his gun, hoping to find a black kid to shoot?  Wow.  Do you honestly think that?  I, that, well, why, why was he patrolling?  Why did he call 911? 
[02:00:30]  Because he's a neighborhood watch guy, and he called 911 because he saw something suspicious.  What happened after that?  Why did the cops not even bother really responding to him because he's such a lunatic because he calls on every black person that he sees?  But, okay, so maybe he does.  No.  Maybe he is more suspicious.  Maybe he did see a black guy in a hoodie and get more suspicious than he would have with a little old lady.  The same as you, by the way.  If you're being honest, if you were walking down the street, and you saw a guy like stupid Sam walking with no hoodie, and you saw Trayvon in a hoodie, are you going to tell me that you would have... 
[02:01:00]  I live in Newark, New Jersey, so you can't, no, you can't say that about me.  Okay, so you would have no more suspicion of the guy in the hoodie at night.  You would feel...  I am taking the light rail.  You're not answering my question.  What do I answer the question?  You're not answering my question.  I'm sorry, suspicious?  Are you telling me...  ...as opposed to an old lady?  Yeah, or, yeah, how about that?  Or a white guy in a suit walking at night, even if they're both honest guys.  Are you going to tell me...  You're hearing things that aren't comparable. 
[02:01:30]  Yes, yes, you are.  You're walking...  Okay, here's...  Why?  Here's comparable.  Hold the phone.  ...a 25-year-old white guy or a 25-year-old...  No, 25-year-old white guy, 25-year-old white guy in a suit, 25-year-old black guy in a hoodie.  They're both walking towards you, the same gait.  They're not walking...  Why don't you put them both in a hoodie, then?  Why?  Oh, no, no.  What?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  It doesn't make a difference, right?  Why should they both be in a hoodie?  Why is that different?  Well, because it makes a difference what somebody wears...  Oh!  So you're acknowledging that there's a different perception when the hoodie's on. 
[02:02:00]  Thanks!  Why?  It makes someone look suspicious?  No, no, no.  There's a difference between a white guy in a hoodie and a black guy in a hoodie.  There you go.  Thank you.  I'm not telling you there's a difference between a black guy in a hoodie.  Of course there's a difference between a black guy in a hoodie and an 80-year-old woman.  Why?  No, I'm going to say a white guy in a suit.  Forget the old one.  White guy in a suit.  Why is there a difference?  Because that's culturally, because...  Culturally.  So you're a racist.  Yeah.  You're a racist, then.  You're a racist, dude. 
[02:02:30]  You made a snap judgment based on appearance and clothing.  You're a racist.  You just did, you phony, what you accused Zimmerman of doing.  Uh, you're crazy.  Yeah.  You just did it.  Yeah, you just did.  If the answer would have been, if it was genuine, do you feel any more suspicion?  25-year-old white guy in a suit, 25-year-old black guy in a hoodie.  Why should they both be in hoodies if you can't tell?  And if it's all...  If you're so free thinking about race, that black guy in a hoodie literally could be a 
[02:03:00]  college dude on his way home in cold.  Why would you...  That's my point exactly.  You just exposed yourself.  Of course you judge people differently by their clothing because a guy in a fucking  jumpsuit cleaning off garbage is a guy that's in jail.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  That's a uniform.  Duh.  Liar.  Phony.  With a name tag on his shirt and picking up your garbage.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Wrong.  Those are involuntary uniforms worn with jobs. 
[02:03:30]  A hoodie is just something a casual person could wear or a suit.  Okay, and a suit is something that someone wears with a job.  Yeah, keep trying to bail yourself out.  Everybody saw.  If you're jogging with a suit, do you go walking to the convenience store in a suit?  Maybe.  No, but we both could be walking home from work, could we not?  Because I'm a stand-up and I wear hoodies to work and literally there are times where  I've worn suits on stage.  So let's just say you could see me walking out of a comedy club with a hoodie on and you  could legitimately see me walking out of a comedy club wearing a suit.  No matter what you were wearing. 
[02:04:00]  What's that?  I wouldn't trust you no matter what you were wearing.  Why don't you just admit what you just did?  Stop trying to dance out of it.  Why don't you just admit that you understand this guy?  Listen, I know this is your profession and you're trying to talk circles around me.  No.  Dude, you've just exposed yourself.  I didn't tell you what to say.  You judge that black guy in that hoodie differently than that white guy in that suit.  You don't have to admit that, but everybody listening knows that's the truth. 
[02:04:30]  You just said it.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I mean, I guess if that's what you whatever.  No, no.  You just keep throwing.  You just keep.  That's exactly in the you just did exactly what people do.  You phonally sit there.  And look, Zimmerman may be a racist dude.  He may be.  I'm not saying he's not.  But your willingness to overlook what NBC just did.  Well, you don't know because it kind of matches your news from NBC.  So I read, you know, and like I said, it wasn't you can't prove that it was it was intentional. 
[02:05:00]  And that's my only point in the beginning was that that that it might have been a mistake.  You're willing to prove intentional.  And I'm like, oh, it was intentional.  It was wrong to do.  You're 100 percent sure that Zimmerman's a racist, though.  To act like, I mean, like shit.  Steve Doocy from Fox News picked up a piece of paper and told everybody about the Republican talking points.  Right.  Yeah.  Keep it. 
[02:05:30]  Keep it about Fox.  Keep it about Fox.  You just exposed yourself.  OK, you saw.  Why?  How can we can't?  Why can't we put them both in hoodies?  Because the white guy in the suit is less of a threat to you as a man caller.  You feel less of a threat than that black guy in that hoodie.  And you don't want to admit it again.  But that's the truth.  I don't feel a threat.  It was the perception that we were talking about.  OK.  I'm not personally feeling threatened because like I said.  So why is the perception any different?  That's no bullshit.  You could look up my. 
[02:06:00]  I'm not interested in that.  Look it up.  Dude.  You're talking about the perception.  Why is the perception any different?  Because the perception of the guy with the suit is that he's coming to or going from work.  Right.  So you make a free.  Thank you.  You make a judgment based on appearance.  Hello.  So, dude, that that hoodie guy.  You're going to tell me you can play for the NFL, for Christ's sake.  They make a lot more money than most douchebags in suits. 
[02:06:30]  So.  That was.  Right now.  My point is not to make the judgment on the hoodie.  Well, why is the guy from the fucking suit going to work and the guy with the hoodie not?  You're cornering me into tits.  They're making a judgment on a guy in a suit.  Because, yeah, he's coming to or from work.  A guy in a hoodie could be anyone.  Oh.  And a guy in a suit couldn't be.  And meanwhile, they've stolen more money than guys in hoodies have ever stolen.  I'm not the one that made the judgment.  I'm not the one that's making the judgment on the guy in the hoodie.  Do you make the.  You're just pointing out that there's a difference between a guy in a hoodie and a guy in a suit.  You're saying. 
[02:07:00]  I don't make a judgment on people with a hoodie.  Your phone.  Dude, you're saying that the guy.  One guy in the suit is going to work and the other guy isn't.  Who would you feel more.  I'm saying you don't know if the other guy is or not.  That's all I said.  Okay.  Okay.  You're right.  You win.  Go ahead, Lib.  You win.  You win.  You weren't just phony.  You didn't just back yourself into a corner.  Go ahead.  You're right.  I'll give it to you.  You're right.  I'm not trying to win anything.  It's just.  It's bullshit that this guy did not get in trouble for it.  Okay. 
[02:07:30]  And so you're saying.  If it was a black guy that shot a white kid, he'd be in jail.  So you know that.  If you had seen.  If you had been.  And again, I'm not even saying Zimmerman's right.  But if you had been in that neighborhood watch.  And you had seen a white guy walking with his suit.  Or a black guy in a hoodie.  Are you going to tell me honestly.  That you would have equal feelings about the intents of both of those guys?  Yeah, absolutely.  I simply don't believe you.  I don't either.  I feel bad for the black guy.  I just gave a black guy a ride in my. 
[02:08:00]  There.  Wow.  There you.  Thank you.  Oh my God.  Is he textbook.  You feel bad for the.  Along with the cane.  Because his car had broke.  Maternal.  This.  Maternal.  Yes.  Nobody would even stop to give the poor guy a ride.  That's right.  The killing is not racism.  Come on.  You're great.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Whether you realize it or not, dude.  You're exhibiting it.  Yeah.  You're covering up your own deep seated.  You're racist. 
[02:08:30]  Dude.  You're racist.  You're a superiority complex white guy.  There's no superiority white.  I actually felt bad for the poor fella.  I felt bad for a black guy recently.  Hey.  Let me tell you what I did for a black guy.  Oh God.  Gosh.  You guys are a pisser.  Wow.  Thank you.  Dude.  Thank you so much for your call.  Thanks, man.  All right, Jay.  All right, Jay.  Thank you very much, Jay.  Call any day.  Everybody wants in.  It is astounding.  And the problem is the media does this all the time. 
[02:09:00]  Remember we played the clip of the kid who wants to be a cop?  Oh, right.  And they edited it in such a way where it sounded like all he wanted to do was shoot people?  Right.  Could you find that?  Because that was a big one as well.  This happens all the time.  But Rene in New Mexico says you guys are just as guilty as NBC.  Really?  Let's talk to Rene.  Rene.  Hi, Rene.  Hey, fellas.  What's up?  Girl name.  Girl name.  We've had him on before.  We've had you on, sir.  I know.  Every time.  All right.  What's going on today? 
[02:09:30]  You guys all last week have talked more on the Zimmerman side than the kid's side.  Even though Jimmy would go, you know, I think he might be racist, but just 90% of the talk  has been favored towards Zimmerman.  Really?  But don't act like you guys aren't for that.  Rene, I'm going to tell you.  Rene, I'm really not for Zimmerman.  I just don't know yet.  Right.  Because I don't know what's, I don't know who is yelling on the 911 call.  That's your question.  Hold on.  Let me just, and I did, Rene, I did say last week, wow, it sounds like he said fucking coons. 
[02:10:00]  When we played that tape, I didn't buy the explanation that it was goons.  I said it sounds like he said fucking coons.  I just want to know, did he have the injuries?  Did any witnesses see?  I just don't know enough to all of a sudden say this guy belongs in jail yet.  Okay.  Let me explain something.  You're walking down the street, right?  I'm just going to get this out.  You're walking down the street.  So you're 17.  Some dude in his 30s with a ball head is falling.  He's not in a cop car.  He doesn't have a cop uniform.  He's falling for a while. 
[02:10:30]  Okay.  You're looking back.  You're like, what's this fucking dude doing, right?  You're showing you're 17.  The dude approaches you.  Me at 17, and I would guess maybe Opie, not you too, because I think you guys can fight  with a paperback, but I think Opie would have punched that dude, because you don't know  who this guy is.  You want to get the upper move on this guy.  He's been falling for a while.  You might be right.  By the way, I'm a lover, not a fighter.  Just want everyone to know that.  You start losing the fight.  What are you going to do?  Yes.  Renee, you're saying what we think might have happened. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, if anyone was healthy, it was the kid who was defending himself from some dude  that he didn't know was a watchman.  He didn't know what the name was.  He was following him and defending himself because he didn't know who this dude was following  him.  That's kind of creepy.  We're not saying you're wrong.  You're agreeing with us.  You're speculating like everyone else is.  But, dude, I don't think that you're wrong.  You're speculating too, Anthony.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  There's plenty of speculation.  But what I said also was, we're just waiting to see what the fuck comes out of an investigation.  And, by the way, you just, you said that we're pro-Zimmerman, and this is why I don't 
[02:11:30]  like that judgment, because what you just said is probably what Zimmerman will say.  I was...  It sounds like you guys are.  No.  You're hearing it wrong.  ...trying to have major black talk, like, always.  I had changed the channel, like, 20 times last week, because you guys take this time to  go, Anthony's Black Land.  It's just like...  But, you...  Renee...  ...got some knucklehead chasing some kid down.  You just said what my take on the story is. 
[02:12:00]  That he probably did strike him first because he was fucking freaked out or just mad, like  this asshole was following him.  And Zimmerman probably started getting beaten up and shot him.  That's what Zimmerman's argument is.  You just told Zimmerman's story.  You called to accuse us to tell us we're more Zimmerman, and you tell his story.  Oh, okay.  Anthony, laugh and make like...  I'm not...  That's me, dude.  That's Jim.  That's how the Anthony laughs.  Ugh.  If you...  If you antagonize somebody and get your outkickers out, he's going to shoot somebody. 
[02:12:30]  I didn't say...  Nobody said it was.  Nobody said Zimmerman didn't react wrong.  No one said that.  You're saying that because you want to think that we're pro-Zimmerman and fuck Trayvon.  No one said fuck Trayvon.  Well, not that I think, but that's what it sounds like to me.  Well, then you heard it wrong.  To you.  Maybe I'm wrong.  No, you are.  But it sounds like coming out of my radio.  That's fine.  Well, okay.  We're just focusing on this particular clip today because it's new, you know? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  I'm just glad that me and Anthony aren't yelling at each other.  That's what I'm having.  Well, I'm talking to you.  And, dude, shouldn't you realize you're wrong when you call up and say that you think that  we're too...  No, no, no, no.  About us being pro-Zimmerman.  That's my opinion.  How can I be wrong if that's my opinion?  Because you're making a judgment on what our opinion is.  It's my opinion that you guys have been pro-Zimmerman.  It's his opinion on our opinion.  But, dude, your opinion is wrong because I'm not pro-Zimmerman.  Stalemate, stalemate. 
[02:13:30]  But it came out like that.  I'm sorry.  That's how it sounds.  Why don't you just admit you heard it like that?  That's how it sounds to you.  God almighty, can you put it on yourself?  It sounds like that to me.  To you.  It sounds like that to me.  Okay, well, congratulations.  That's what matters is what doesn't sound like.  In a self-centered world, yeah.  Not when you're saying that that's how it is.  You're saying we are pro-Zimmerman.  Not that, according to you, it sounded like.  And then you give Zimmerman the side of the story.  Yeah.  Great job, Rene.  No, no, no, no, no.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  That's not how I...  Fuck you, too, Rene.  Because that's what Zimmerman's argument is. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  You just made Zimmerman's argument.  That's not an argument.  He hasn't talked to no one yet.  What argument?  That is what he is telling people happened.  That's what his lawyer is saying happened.  Oh.  He...  Okay.  That he got hit first.  That's not what he said, Jimmy.  No, no, no, no.  He said...  He's saying that Trayvon struck first.  He was being beaten up.  He jumped around and jumped on it from his back.  No, no, no, no.  He's still saying Trayvon struck first.  You said the same thing.  What I said is he pros him. 
[02:14:30]  Oh.  He said he'd come up from behind him.  He turned around and he's walking away and the guy jumped on his back.  Okay.  That's not what I'm saying.  How do you know?  Who hit who first?  Who hit who first?  That's that.  I'm hoping the kid hit him first because some fucking old motherfuckers...  Okay.  There you go.  You think the kid hit him first?  I think it was face-to-face.  I don't think...  Oh.  ...and punched him from behind.  I don't think that happened.  Okay, so you think it was face-to-face because you want to think that.  That happened, right.  No, because it sounds more...  With no evidence or no anything, you're going to say that? 
[02:15:00]  No, there's no evidence the other way either.  Of course.  Well, all you have right now is Zimmerman's...  What he has said.  Like, we just don't have the other stuff yet.  No, there's witnesses.  So it's what Zimmerman said or what you're guessing at.  He said, oh, he's a Mexican.  He's half.  He ain't all Mexican.  He's half white and half Mexican.  That's why his last name is Zimmerman.  So why do you think that...  Why do you think that Trayvon was face-to-face and not facing away?  What evidence do you have to that?  I think he come up to him and goes, what are you doing? 
[02:15:30]  He looks suspicious.  I've been following you.  And freaking Zimmerman's like, this you don't have...  Some dialogue's been added for drama.  That's a pretty good dramatization there.  Yeah, yeah.  No, this is my opinion.  I think the kid went, what the fuck's your problem?  The fucking Zimmerman thinks he's a cop.  And fucking the kid didn't know.  Cool.  So he probably fucking defended himself.  Which, oh yeah, he didn't have a right to defend himself.  Because some 35-year-old man's fallen on his ass from 17 years ago.  Yeah, we heard you already.  You said that.  And that's apparently a great defense in court.  You replace yourself every fucking day with your black talk.  So fuck you, Jimmy.  Fuck you, too, Renee. 
[02:16:00]  Fuck you, too.  And thanks a lot.  Hey, thanks a lot for calling up and giving Zimmerman's side of the story.  Good job, Renee.  Yeah, I know you're a tough guy.  Hey, thanks for calling up and giving Zimmerman's side of the story. 
[02:16:30]  Bye-bye, girl name.  Oh, what a fucking dummy.  Oh, my God.  Fuck your angry routine, shithead.  You called up.  And he just made it up.  He goes, oh, my God, that 35-year-old man, he turned around.  And then he said to him, and then he said, where are you getting your transcripts from?  Boring douchebag.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Yeah, we don't know.  We don't know shit.  No one knows.  Thank you for giving Zimmerman's side, though, Renee.  I appreciate that.  That's exactly what Zimmerman's argument is. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that he was hit.  Trayvon hit him.  He was getting beaten up, and he shot him.  Yeah.  And it will come out.  I was a...  And Zimmerman might say, yeah, I overreacted, or I thought my life was in danger.  Yeah.  But thank you to guys like fucking that one liberal, and thank you to Renee for calling  up and making the exact point they fucking were against.  It's going to be called the Renee defense, actually.  He's gone with it.  What a dunce.  Getting back to our original point of what the media does with these clips, though, you  know, they do it all the fucking time, and we're calling them out on it.  And this is a clip we played a little while ago about a little four-year-old that wants 
[02:17:30]  to be a cop.  And do you have the whole thing here, Sam?  Or what are we about to hear for the people out there?  Basically, there was a shooting, and so they're interviewing witnesses, and they interviewed  this little four-year-old.  So I'm going to play this, and then I'm just going to skip ahead to where the raw, actual  uncut all that.  And then I'd like Renee to call back so I can hear what he's saying.  Because I guess Renee thinks it's okay to beat up somebody if they're 18 years older  than you and following you.  You can turn around on a fucking pound, pig!  Shut up!  To someone's point, they do edit for time, but they also have a responsibility to make 
[02:18:00]  sure it doesn't completely change the context of the clip.  That's exactly it.  But we know, because we study this shit on a daily basis, that the media does this all  the fucking time to make it a more interesting story.  And by the way...  And the facts don't matter anymore half the time.  Can I tell you, here's the call Renee would have wanted to make.  Right.  Dude, sometimes I think what I should have done, because people would always call me like  faggot in girls' names, but I kind of wish that they would have done that to me,  and I'd have turned around and hit them and bow, pig! 
[02:18:30]  Stop trying to fit your own insecure story in there, fucking broad name.  Shut up.  Broad name.  Shut up.  Go home and bake your man a fucking delicious tray of cookies.  Shut up, girl.  Here's another example of the media fucking up with clips and editing them to make it a  better story for their viewers.  Hit it.  No, I'm not scared of nothing.  When you get older, are you going to stay away from all these guns?  No.  No?  No.  What do you want to do when you get older? 
[02:19:00]  I'm going to have me a gun.  Because I live, right?  I'm going to have me a gun.  That's what they aired.  And it makes it sound like, oh my God, look at this society.  Little black kid wants to be a gangbanger.  Oh, that's what they aired.  Black kid wants a gun.  That was from the news broadcast.  Okay.  Yeah.  And this is what it actually is.  Damn.  When you get older, are you going to stay away from all these guns?  No.  No?  No.  What do you want to do when you get older?  I'm going to have me a gun.  You are?  Why do you want to do that? 
[02:19:30]  You know what?  I'm going to be the police.  Okay.  Well, then you can have one.  My first question is what?  But you can have one.  Oh, man.  100% different intentions.  It completely changed it.  Totally.  Making a four-year-old think, you know, all he wants to do is shoot people.  One is pitting him as a life of going to prison, and one is him fighting the bad guys.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  That's how the context is changed in that edit.  Wow.  And meanwhile, that was probably for time.  Right.  That was for time.  Just completely changing the context.  Because that dude, that four-year-old, he'd have probably turned around and fucking hit 
[02:20:00]  that 30-year-old.  Oh, yeah.  Kept calling him a chick name.  They kept calling me Mary and sissy and girl voice, and they told me to make them pies,  and I should have hit them.  Ah, Renee.  Black kid wants to do good.  With his life.  Yes.  But the news makes it completely different.  As a rule of thumb, I don't respect any man with a little crooked dash over the last  letter of his name.  I don't like any man who has to put a dash over the last letter of his name.  Sorry, any dash over the top. 
[02:20:30]  Whatever it's called.  Yeah.  How do you get that on a type of writer?  We should break, because Bill Burr is going to join the show.  And we'll, I don't know, maybe we'll change gears next.  We'll figure it out.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Got Bill Burr on his way.  Should be here in moments, but we got an exclusive on the hotline, man.  Oh, good.  We got an exclusive.  Live from Florida, it's E-Rock. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, it's an old stomping ground.  It's home.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  How many fat and whale jokes have you made today?  Oh, wow.  So far, three hours and nine minutes worth.  To be honest with you, you did it to yourself this time by texting Sam and telling him that  they ran out of food at WrestleMania.  You make it easy, E-Rock.  Yeah, because if I didn't bring that up, then you'd be saying, why did you tell the show that?  So, wait, did you just sleep in today? 
[02:21:30]  Yes, it was nice.  I got up at 8.40.  Oh, 8.40.  Nice.  How come you turned your phone off?  Yeah, why would you turn your phone off knowing we would have to call you?  You were at a big event last night.  Yeah.  It was on.  I just had the volume off.  I didn't realize it did.  Otherwise, I would have picked up.  How come your face is so red in the cowhead picture?  Yeah, that's why.  Oh, my God.  Remember what I said about a minute ago that you do it to yourself?  You kind of do it to yourself, E-Rock.  We're looking at a picture of you with Mr. Cowhead, who is dressed like a gentleman. 
[02:22:00]  He's got a suit and tie, and he's all put together nice.  And then you're taking a photo with him, and your face couldn't be redder, but it's not  a balanced red throughout your face.  You've got massive white circles around your eyes, and the whole right side of your face  is also white, meaning that you probably fell asleep in the sun.  Well, because you do it on the iPhone with the camera facing you, it doesn't come out  as well.  My face isn't that red, but it is red. 
[02:22:30]  What about the big white circles?  What kind of sunglasses were you wearing?  Pretty cool, huh?  White circles.  Oh, my Calloway sunglasses.  I was out there.  Calloway?  Calloway.  Oh.  What are you, fucking, doing Minnie the Moonshirt?  Let me tell you, Stole Ray Bounder, Eric the Chewer.  It's because he chewed his own hands.  Fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty, fatty.  Oh, shit.  Hoagie, hoagie, hoagie, hoagie, hoagie, hoagie, hoagie. 
[02:23:00]  Sorry.  Hoagie, hoagie, hoagie, hoagie, hoagie.  All right.  So.  I had a couple days.  I figured I'll just go outside, and I didn't even bother with regular suntan lotion.  I threw oil on and just went out.  Oil.  Oil.  Who does that?  Why would you put oil on?  Yes.  I wanted to get something fast, so this way I opened up my mouth.  Yes.  You got something fast.  Exactly.  It's called skin.  Ah, fuck.  Damn it.  Mama, there's a giant red slug there on the chair. 
[02:23:30]  Mama.  How was WrestleMania?  The show was great.  The facility.  How do you know?  It was a fucking nightmare.  Yeah.  How'd you enjoy the guy's back in front of you?  Yeah, we kind of went over all your bullet points.  I guess you paid a lot of money to sit on the floor, but the problem was it wasn't elevated,  so 30 rows back on the floor means you can't see shit.  So you actually was, you were completely turned around to watch on the large screen, right?  If everyone's sitting down, you can see the ring, and you can see the ramp and everything. 
[02:24:00]  But who the fuck sits down at a WrestleMania?  No one.  But the second somebody stands up, you can't see anything, so you have to turn backwards  and look at the huge screen that's on the back of the stadium just to see what's going on.  So you hated the facility.  What else was wrong with it?  They ran out.  Halfway through the show, they ran out of bottled water, beer, food.  Oh, well, well, let's slow down at the food part.  They're generalizing. 
[02:24:30]  What kind of food do they eat?  What did you try to get?  Yeah, what did you try to get?  And don't lie, because we'll know.  Don't lie or we'll know.  Anything you could normally get at a stadium.  He's still being vague.  So what did you eat when you got there?  Let's not lie.  I'm not going to.  I didn't eat anything because it was all empty.  But what did you want to eat?  What did you want to eat?  I was going to go get chicken fingers, but they didn't have any.  I heard you got in trouble for trying to sneak just scoops of ice cream in your four pockets. 
[02:25:00]  What?  Sam?  I've heard that's true.  Is he being vague?  He's being extremely vague.  What was the actual text that he sent you?  Okay.  I don't know why you would text Sam, by the way, you rocked.  We're talking about wrestling.  You just know you're worse than yourself.  Yeah.  We're friends.  But you make it easy.  Remember how I said earlier?  Yeah.  No, it's not true.  You walk right into this shit.  He shouldn't have secrets, because if we found out this was going on and he wasn't telling us,  it'd be much worse.  Okay.  Fair enough, Sam.  Yes.  Hard to contribute.  By the way, a nice pink phone Sam has. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, it's just a case.  Why is it a pink case?  Why are you going pink?  Why?  Well, I like this case, but this was also...  Does that contribute to phone cancer, asshole?  It was given to me for free, so...  And then he got a free case.  Shit.  No, I got a free case.  By DJ Who Kid.  Of course he did.  He fucking can't walk on the hook with that.  Yeah, he doesn't.  Yeah.  He's got a black one.  It was an ass anatom.  And he said he has another case, but it's pink.  You still want it?  And I said yes.  Yeah, he said his brother...  How does he get away with that pink phone?  I don't know.  Because I'm the fucking man.  No, you're not. 
[02:26:00]  I can't have a pink phone.  You're not the man.  I'm kind of the man.  No.  I'm kind of the man.  His brother, quote unquote, went...  Looped around the entire stadium.  Hot dogs, but no buns.  Nachos, but no cheese.  Look, but don't touch.  Buy a ticket, but don't see.  Stand there, but turn around.  Face back.  Go on Weight Watchers, but gain weight. 
[02:26:30]  Go to the pool.  Burn like a lobster.  Bring a camera.  Don't take a picture.  Yeah, you were not prepared for this, Eric.  Well, I didn't have my charger for my regular camera, and halfway through it died out.  What about your cell phone?  I didn't have my cell phone ready because I had the regular camera for what Andy Garcia came out.  How hard is it to get your cell phone ready to take a picture?  Yeah.  Two seconds.  Not even.  It's a hot button on my phone. 
[02:27:00]  Hot button.  What were you saying, Andy Garcia?  Nothing.  He was walking in.  I guess he's got some ownership in that stadium down there.  Oh, wow.  And as he was coming through the back there, people recognized him, and then he was taking  photos as he was walking up to the front.  Did he freak out when he saw you?  Oh, the giant lobster is talking to me.  There's a big fat lobster.  There's a giant sea creature with a broken camera.  He must have taken it from a tourist he ate. 
[02:27:30]  Jesus.  Was he saying that?  Or did he give you his awful man loves a woman speech in the AA meeting?  Fucking hunk of shit.  Where he's talking about her to her?  Right.  Fucking tool.  Stinks.  Continue, Eric.  Yeah.  You had a Sam reading attack.  Yeah, sorry.  Not all the food that wasn't available.  Yeah.  It was...  Eat nachos, no cheese.  I can't see over the guy's wig. 
[02:28:00]  It's mine.  I need some lift.  Yeah.  Because I can't see over the chair in front of me and there's no one in it.  And then he said they also ran out of hamburgers, chicken, and soda, but no cups.  Yes.  They probably had plenty of fucking...  Probably had plenty of, like, you know, turkey and healthy things.  Salads.  I had no idea.  It was a big pile of salad nobody wanted.  Yeah.  What's that?  At a stadium, yeah.  Some of them do.  Why would they run out of cups?  That's kind of dumb, actually. 
[02:28:30]  Who knows?  But if you wanted Sierra Mix, they had it, but they had no fucking cups for anything.  Well, what did you do?  Did you just put your head under there?  Did you get the back of your neck all sticky on the bottom with a fucking soda gun?  He just putts his head under there.  Yeah.  Give me $16 worth.  Fill her up.  He was like an RV.  Fill her up.  Laying on his back with his fucking bare feet, his bare piggies sticking up straight out.  Bare piggies.  Head on that fucking grate for the soda gun.  What shirt did you wear? 
[02:29:00]  I had my old school rock shirt on.  Oh, you were going.  I told you he was chanting for the rock.  Sean in NC on Twitter writes, why didn't, and I'm just reading this at you, Rock, so  don't get mad at me.  Why didn't Fatty just stand up when everybody else did?  Oh.  Because he didn't want to see what's the sits.  But he said if you sit, you could see everything.  So then if everyone stands, that means if you stood, you could still see everything.  How many times can a person stand up and sit down?  Why didn't you stand up?  Because when you stand up, everyone else stands up because something's going on in the ring 
[02:29:30]  or somebody's coming out.  And you're afraid you're going to knock your fucking Fritos over?  Were you afraid you were going to knock your fucking, your smuggled in munchkins over?  He smuggled in munchkins?  Yes, he did.  He actually had a fake cash filled with munchkins.  Cashed?  I know.  You had to cast with an H.  He's got money, too.  Jimmy's just very excited.  Yeah.  Very excited.  I'm missing Eric.  Eric, why would you park so close to the stadium? 
[02:30:00]  Most people use the other strategy of parking way, you know, far away near an exit.  Did you ask for the handicapped wheelchair, too?  No, because we got a parking pass that got us right up to the entrance of the stadium.  But that don't mean shit when everyone's exiting.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you'd think like a normal stadium, they would have all these auxiliary exits  to get all the crowd out of there.  But no, they just funnel you in and out the same way.  The stadium is a piece of shit.  Is that where Miami plays? 
[02:30:30]  I don't even know.  Yeah, it's where golfers play.  It's a fucking nightmare.  They ran out of all of this stuff.  That's why they ran out of fear.  It's a fucking nightmare.  No nachos.  I know.  You're acting like fucking New Orleans during the fucking hurricane.  No, relax.  You just couldn't get your treats.  It's the biggest wrestling show of all time.  It's a fucking nightmare.  I don't have nachos.  Exactly.  I couldn't get enough carbs in me.  I'm tired from laying out all day like a fat lobster boy. 
[02:31:00]  I'm sorry.  I understand.  But I hadn't eaten in minutes.  I was hungry.  Okay, so I'm sorry, you lobstery sweetie.  What else are you saying?  Almost lobstery.  Why is the right side of your face very white?  Do people keep throwing warm butter on you and biting you when you get angry?  You're not coming back with dyed hair, are you?  No.  Fifty bucks if you dye your hair.  With a shotgun.  I want to dye it red.  Red mist.  Match your face.  This poor sunburned guy. 
[02:31:30]  No, what happened?  Was it a nightmare or what, Eric?  I didn't hear you what?  Why was it a nightmare?  Besides the fact they didn't have treats.  Besides.  There was that.  There was people fighting.  The parking situation was terrible.  The whole place just doesn't know what the hell is going on.  On the positive side, how did Undertaker's entrance look live?  Because it was amazing.  I heard that was amazing.  It was.  How did it look live?  Yeah, I didn't see that.  Why?  You were there.  You were right there.  Because everyone...  Waiting on a food line? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, they were stood up.  They were on the chair.  It is.  And I couldn't see shit.  And then you go into the aisles to try to look.  And security yells at you to get back at your seat.  And they're clearing the area.  Because it's a fire hazard.  Took up the whole aisle.  Yeah, that's what I was insinuating.  But didn't you pay over $1,000 for those seats?  I saw the entrance and I only paid $50.  Oh, that I did.  Wow.  A thousand bucks?  Oh, well over $1,000.  And they needed special seats. 
[02:32:30]  A dollar a pound.  Oh, my God.  Even with his family, it's too much weight.  It's much too much weight, Sam.  When you walked in all red-faced, did they try to argue with you and you had to prove that  you weren't a crustacean?  You're obsessed with his lobster look.  I love it.  He really is.  Sir, you're a lobster.  Yeah.  Who is that lobster, you motherfucker?  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Iraq.  Sorry.  We're interrupting.  That's rude. 
[02:33:00]  A thousand bucks for like...  No, well over $1,000.  Well over $1,000 for just shitty seats.  And you could have watched it on pay-per-view and seen it better.  I mean, I saw it.  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.  When you looked at the map, the seating chart for the stadium, like, wow, these seats are  really great.  Look how close they are.  You get there from the center of the ring all the way to the edge of the field in each  direction.  They didn't even raise it in certain areas so that, you know, you could have a view.  It's just flat all the way to the end and you can't see shit. 
[02:33:30]  And then they had the big screens above the ring so you could kind of see the action that's  going on there.  But they have the lighting rigs in front of the screen so you can't even see half the  screen.  You should have asked for better seats because you should have told them that it's a football  stadium and they named the ball after you.  Because it's big skin.  Big skin.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[02:34:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm just tired.  Wow.  Oof.  E to you.  I'm sorry, Eric.  What happened?  Nothing happened.  What was your favorite match to watch live?  Uh, the match that I could see, uh, probably.  E-Rock versus The Vendors.  E-Rock.  Oh.  Who cares about your favorite match?  Exactly.  Probably Rock.  With his fucking ill-fitting t-shirt.  You don't think it fit in that well?  No, it probably said Rock. 
[02:34:30]  Where do you think it clung to?  Oh, God.  Under his tits.  It probably looked like a fucking dickie.  It looked like a lobster wearing a lobster bib.  It's fucking...  It's an XL.  Where's the Bill Burr?  He's stuck in traffic last I checked.  Traffic.  Where's he coming from?  Traffic schmaffic.  I don't know.  We got the Chevy Chase call.  Oh, I want to hear that.  Oh, they had the call he released?  Oh, yeah.  We got the call.  And it's good.  We were just talking to Gillian Jacobs the other day, saying, come on. 
[02:35:00]  Tell us.  He's an asshole, right?  We all know he's an asshole.  Yeah.  We've been told he's an asshole.  Everyone knows he's an asshole.  He's never not been an asshole.  Me and Ant were in the makeup room the same time as this fucking jizz bag, and he wouldn't  fucking talk to us after we try to introduce ourselves.  He's an asshole.  You don't think this is a work?  No!  So, what's the story?  I guess he walked off the set last day of Shooting Community this past season.  Yeah, so apparently they were filming the finale, and he walked off the set. 
[02:35:30]  Some people say it's because he didn't think the episode was funny, and he said it's because  they didn't have a script, and so he was tired of it, and so he walked off.  Um, then Dan Harmon, who's the show creator, at the wrap party that Chevy Chase and his  family were at, had a toast that said, fuck you, Chevy, and tried to get everybody to chant,  fuck you, Chevy.  While Chevy was in the room.  While Chevy and his wife.  Yeah.  Right.  And so then Chevy left an expletive-laden voicemail for Dan Harmon, which Dan Harmon then shared 
[02:36:00]  with everybody.  One of those people was recording it.  Oh!  Oh, very cool.  So, I hear it's hard to hear, though, unfortunately, huh?  It's a little hard to hear, but you can make it out.  You can make out some of the shit?  Mm-hmm.  All right, here's, uh, Chevy Chase.  Ladies and gentlemen, Chevy Chase.  I hope you're ready.  Take your message.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Take your message.  The ladies and gentlemen, that's, uh, on the phone.  Dan Harmon.  That's Dan Harmon.  Being an asshole to Chevy, like, ladies and gentlemen, Chevy Chase, because he knew he  was revving up.  No, he's saying, ladies and gentlemen, Chevy Chase, and then he played the voicemail. 
[02:36:30]  Oh!  Got it.  Got it.  It's theater for you.  Right.  Ladies and gentlemen, Chevy Chase.  I hope you're ready.  Take your message.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Take your message.  You fat fucker.  You didn't give us a script to begin with, so nobody knew what the fuck was going on  with the week, during the week.  Second of all, you're goddamn bad writing.  Shit.  Sneakhole.  What's up, abomination.  And your writing is getting worse and worse, so suck my cock. 
[02:37:00]  They're all laughing.  They're all laughing.  Why are they laughing?  They'll all laugh at you.  Something's suspicious about this.  Yes.  He's roasting him back or something.  There's something weird going on.  Something's suspicious.  I thought he was playing it in front of a bunch of people.  He is.  And they're laughing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who are the bunch of people, though?  Probably co-workers.  Because they all know Chevy's an asshole.  That's what I'm getting from it.  Oh, okay.  Like, they're not taking him seriously.  It's like, listen to this fucking dick.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I think that's what it is.  Because he said in the past that he has problems with the show. 
[02:37:30]  He doesn't like...  Oh, okay.  ...Dan Harman.  He's a dude.  Why doesn't he like Community?  He doesn't like...  Critically acclaimed.  Wouldn't most actors want that?  He said he doesn't like...  On their resume?  He doesn't think it's a funny show.  And he doesn't think his character's funny.  He said...  Why is he doing it?  Like, they'll ask him to hack you, like, you know, you know, are you like your character?  And he goes, no, I'm funny.  My character's not funny.  He's funny when?  Yeah.  When was Chevy fucking funny?  Oh, God.  I don't get talked to like that by anybody, certainly not in front of my wife and daughter. 
[02:38:00]  You goddamn asshole.  Alcohol and fat shit.  There don't have to be about 57 if you're lucky, the way you eat.  I'm not going to say to you, except you can suck my cock.  It's unclear.  I hope you can play that for everybody around you who agrees with you.  You should say, fuck you, and in front of all of those people, to me, am I, tell me.  Wow.  Hmm.  Wow. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think it's a work.  No, no, no, you're right.  I for a second thought it was because they were laughing.  Yeah, no, it sounds like it's not.  But it's almost like Chevy, don't you know, everyone who's ever worked with you says that  you're a douchebag.  Yeah.  Everyone.  Yeah.  Everyone.  He says he doesn't like sitcoms.  But why are you doing one?  Just keep doing movies.  There's a calm part of it he's got a problem with.  Yeah.  He's terrible.  This is going to be the last season of Community?  Well, I mean, I would think that they would want to go on as long as possible.  They're not planning on ending it now, but like season four, I guess, is when you get  into syndication. 
[02:39:00]  So they're excited about this one.  Well, they thought that this one that just happened could be the last one after they went  on hiatus.  But I don't know if season four, I don't think it's officially been announced yet, but everybody's  hoping that it happens.  They haven't been picked up, but it's the second highest rated sitcom.  Yeah.  Behind the office.  After they came back, they started murdering comparatively.  Nice.  Good for them.  I like a lot of those people.  It's a good show, too.  It's really funny.  I love Joe McHale.  We go way back with Joe.  Joe. 
[02:39:30]  Not so much with Chevy.  No?  Soup days.  I would have had a great line if I was there, too.  What would you have said?  Hey, I wish he was.  He'd tell you how he really feels.  Ah, it's a good one.  It is a good one.  What?  Probably better that you weren't there.  Ah, a place where I went bananas.  I don't think so.  Sam, Chris Humphreys.  Yeah.  That's where the whole looking like a dummy in a hot tub started, with Chris Humphreys.  I thought it was with Diddy.  I don't know if it was Diddy.  I thought we were talking about Chris Humphreys.  But Diddy was in the hot tub in Biggie's video, just like a dummy in the hot tub. 
[02:40:00]  That's true, too.  Yeah.  But we did refer to Chris Humphreys as the big dummy in the hot tub.  He's also a dummy in the hot tub.  But you know what?  He's fighting back.  You know, he's got that Kim Kardashian divorce thing happening, and he refuses to sign the  papers.  Until she admits it's fake, right?  Yep.  Seven million fucking dollars they're willing to pay Chris Humphreys.  And they have called him kind of a gold digger.  And he's like, I ain't signing shit until this broad and her family admits this whole  thing was a fake fucking wedding. 
[02:40:30]  Wait, they'll pay him to sign?  Does he admit the whole thing was fake?  Or he thought it was real, and he's realizing that he was set up?  I believe his claim is that it was, they set it up without telling him.  Without telling him, right.  And he thought it was real?  Yeah.  And he's a fucking idiot, so that's a possibility.  So wait a minute, did fucking, what's the seven million dollar thing?  They're saying if you...  They're trying to settle and say, here, here's your seven million, sign the fucking divorce  papers, let's all go on.  And don't talk about it anymore.  Right.  He's like, fuck you, because he, you know, he's the laughing stock of the NBA.  They fucking chant and make fun of him all the time. 
[02:41:00]  This is genuinely embarrassing for the Kardashians, too, to have this continue to be dragged  on.  Yeah.  He looked like an idiot through this whole fucking thing.  And so he's fighting back, saying, fuck you.  They like to somewhat control their press, whether it's positive or negative, just to  kind of, you know...  He's refusing to divorce Kim unless she gives him a public apology and admits the entire  wedding was staged by her and her family.  There you go.  They've offered him seven million to shut up and go away.  But he won't take it.  Nope. 
[02:41:30]  Chris wants Kim to admit to fraud, to admit the whole thing was staged for publicity, to  make a public apology to him because he really wanted a marriage.  So he believed it was real.  He was very much in love.  And now he's starting to think, holy fuck, these assholes set me up.  Very much in love.  Very much in love.  He was such a dolt on that show.  He's a moron.  But they really fucking...  If that's true, then they really fucked him over.  Yeah.  Then they did fuck him over.  And the Kardashians, the Team Kim, they call it, they're attacking Humphreys.  They're trying to spin Kim as the victim, but Chris isn't going to stand for it. 
[02:42:00]  Good for him, man.  How much is his contract for in the NBA?  He might not need seven million.  He might get more out of this.  No one would say no to seven million dollars, O'Jay.  That's true.  What the fuck you make?  You kidding me?  Gotta grieve with you.  Gotta grieve with you on that one.  If he's not letting it go for seven million, that's fucking...  He's making a few million a year easy.  He is, right?  Oh, yeah.  So...  Just for putting a ball in a hoop, what about that?  Perhaps.  I hear ya.  What's his contract?  Um, what... 
[02:42:30]  What's his...  What is he?  Oh, uh...  3.2 million.  I mean, it's a lot, but I mean...  He could use seven, though.  Fuck yeah.  The character Chevy plays is exactly like he is on the voicemail.  Maybe they're trying to get a little buzz out there.  Should we be suspicious or not on that one?  No, that's...  I mean, Travis...  The voicemail is not like Chevy's character at all.  All right.  He doesn't walk around calling people drunk cocksuckers.  There's another update on Deadline's website that says that a lot of people there at the 
[02:43:00]  cast party agree with Chevy's side of the story, that they were having a, quote, non-script  day when he walked off.  So, Chevy seems to be telling the truth there, if you're to believe other people, and...  Well, it still comes off as a prick.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  But I don't think this is a work at all.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I think you're right.  It's fine with us for a second.  Plus, it's...  I mean, it's not like it's just like a nice guy who's historically gotten a great reputation  coming out and looking like an asshole now.  Right.  We all knew he was an asshole before.  There's nothing worse than a fake call or whatever, because, you know, nobody wants 
[02:43:30]  to hear a work like that.  It's just fucking stupid.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm going to read the paper for a second.  All right.  All right.  Well, Bill Burr is making his way into the studio, so...  Oh, man.  Jimmy's got to go...  Oh, Bill's here.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh, no.  You don't have to go read the paper?  No, I was going to make a phone call.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Bill Burr.  Hi, Bill.  Bring it in.  Who are you?  Gentlemen, what's going on?  Bill Burr.  What's up, Bill?  Hi, sir.  I was complimenting your podcast earlier today.  I finally started checking it out. 
[02:44:00]  Well, thank you.  People love it.  It's really good, man.  Oh, they love it.  I like it a lot.  Where were you coming from?  Tarrytown.  That's the sound of me taking off my coat, ladies and gentlemen.  The Velcro.  Tarrytown.  Yeah.  How was the gig?  Amazing.  Yeah, it was awesome.  Someone tweeted me and said that you beat the shit out of someone in the front row, and  it was awesome.  They were texting or fucking something.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Some guy bought it.  He bought a ticket for him and his girl, and she blew him off.  And then, like, he said, to hell with it.  I'm still going to the show. 
[02:44:30]  So, you know her.  She's like, oh, my God.  Is he having a good time with that week?  So she starts texting him during the show.  So he's having, like, a text fight.  So I was like, what are you doing?  And he explained the thing.  So he just handed me the phone.  That's funny.  And I just texted, this is Bill Burr.  Leave this poor bastard alone.  And I hit send it.  Oh, the hilarity ensued.  Hilarity.  You made something out of it.  Yes, I did.  At the Jim Norton Show at Caroline's, we had a guy.  Two nights.  Two nights.  Two nights.  The night you were there, and the next night we had guys right in the fucking front center 
[02:45:00]  table.  Oh, it's brutal.  And you can tell he's a huge fan of Jim Norton.  That's the problem.  It's not one of these guys that walked in with a bachelor party or some shit.  You can tell the guy really likes Jim.  He's even a minute.  Kenny gave him a talking.  He's like, look, I've been checking you out for the last ten years.  I'm a fan.  But he wouldn't fucking shut up.  Wouldn't stop interrupting.  So then he leaves, right?  And Kenny takes him out.  But Jimmy, I love you.  But it's amazing.  They never think they're wrong.  I hate alcohol.  And then outside in the signing line, I'm talking to him and his chick for a minute.  I'm trying to be nice to him.  And then I'm going to take a picture of this chick.  He goes, oh, fuck this guy. 
[02:45:30]  He's in a blackout.  And the night before, some big fat guy up front kept interrupting and pointing at his friend going,  ah, hey, hey.  Oh, God, what is that?  I'm like, are there any single girls?  He's like, hey.  He's like, you know the type.  And they never think they're fucking wrong, dude.  Fucking idiots.  And they're amazed when they get thrown out.  The biggest one I ever had was this guy, DC Improv.  He was the biggest asshole.  I didn't want to say what the guy was saying during my act because your listeners will then do it off. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  Just would not shut up.  Helpful heckling, screaming the whole time.  So finally he gets tossed out.  And it's the classic comedy club tossing out.  They put him like an eighth of an inch beyond the door.  And they're just like, well, that settles that problem.  They turn their backs.  Of course, he comes back in.  And I'm standing there, right?  And we really got into it.  Doing the stupid DVDs.  And the last guy, who am I looking at?  The asshole they're supposed to throw out.  And he's like, you don't understand.  I love you.  He's like spitting in my face as he's telling me that he loves me.  It was brutal. 
[02:46:30]  And then the club does nothing, right?  Oh, even better.  Comes back the next night.  They don't even recognize him.  Somebody overhears him saying, I'm sitting down in the front.  And I'm yelling out all his punchlines.  And they put him right in the third row.  And I come walking out.  And there's the same dude.  Same guy.  Same guy.  And rather than an idiot, I don't just say, hey, this is the same guy.  I just stand there defensively, delivering my act in an angry way.  Just waiting for this guy.  So now I start having a bad show.  Oh, shit.  And then out of nowhere, the guy says one thing. 
[02:47:00]  And they toss him out.  And then the crowd turned on me.  And this guy was just going like, dude, you're the headliner.  You should have to deal with that.  Or something like that.  Don't you explain what happened the night before?  You didn't explain?  You almost have to at that point.  But I think if someone tried to walk out on the check, the fucking club would have somebody there stopping him.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  That's a little more important.  Choke him out.  Yeah, just sit there and enjoy, man.  Please.  I feel bad for these guys.  What's worse than when you're bombing in front of somebody who you know is rooting for you to bomb? 
[02:47:30]  Like somebody who doesn't like you?  That's got to suck.  It's the worst.  Are you taking a peek at him to see?  Every so often you're giving out.  Are you taking a peek at the guy?  I have to tell you what.  I'm bombing for that guy.  I have to tell you what the guy was saying.  I don't give a shit if this hurts me for a couple of weeks.  Any joke I would tell, the crowd would laugh and he'd just go,  Oh, Billy!  Dude, it was like maniacal.  Like I was thinking like maybe he's going to stop and he just kept doing it.  What an asshole. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, and I kept going, dude, you're freaking people out.  You're ruining the show for everybody.  And he said, Mom, I love you!  They don't understand.  They're just self-centered.  Fucking classic.  And they get so mad.  They turn so fast and they can't comprehend how they're fucking it up for everybody.  And it's the alcohol.  Yeah.  It's the alcohol.  How many downloads are you doing a week about?  Your numbers are up there?  Yeah, about 125, 150.  150,000?  Yeah.  A week?  Yeah, I've been doing like...  Holy fuck.  You do one hour a week? 
[02:48:30]  Well, come on.  Yes, I do.  That's great.  I've got to do one after this.  No more than an hour.  Not that you need advice from me.  No, no more than an hour.  Because I'm...  You do it once a week.  Leave him wanting more, Opie.  Dude, I'm starting to like download the podcast.  I've got too many to listen to now.  So an hour, it's like beautiful.  All right, I'll knock off Bill Burr.  I'm going to knock off Bill Burr and Jay Moore today.  It's my day.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus, great.  Well, you go for...  He says he's doing it because of you.  I was listening to Florentine's.  Florentine's is hilarious.  Yeah, I haven't checked his out yet.  It's hilarious.  I listened to the one where he went off on the Super Bowl. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, beautiful.  Yeah, I was working with Verzi last night.  We were driving back, listening to it, trying to do Florentine.  Yeah.  I like your take on basketball.  Fucking joke.  Yeah.  That's awful.  What guy is enjoying that?  Why?  Fucking Bud Light commercial.  I've never seen a good-looking girl before.  Ridiculous.  What a joke.  What a joke.  So we were just listening to that, just waiting for him to say,  fucking joke.  And just dying laughing.  He killed it on the whole Tebow angle. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, I didn't hear that.  Ah, it's really...  Well, he did on our show.  I don't know if he did on his podcast yet, though.  Oh, I gotta hear that.  It's really good.  No, his stuff on sports is impeccable.  Really good, right?  Oh, yeah.  His ability to deal logically with it, he's fucking undefeatable.  I said it to Jay, but it's also, you're the same way.  You guys always have a great take on sports.  You, Jay, and certainly Florentine.  Oh, thank you.  Not that typical sports talk bullshit.  You always find that fucking, that left turn, man.  I love it.  You know what freaks me out on ESPN is Herm Edwards. 
[02:50:00]  Like, I don't know what happened to that guy.  He was like a badass defensive back when he was a coach.  You know, the guy, he was just the man.  He was like a drill sergeant.  You're like, yeah, look at that guy.  He goes on that show.  I don't know what he's doing.  He always starts slow, and then he just wigs out.  He just goes like, hey, the Jets are playing the Bengals.  What do you think?  He goes, well, you know, you got two people playing a football game on Sunday.  I got to fucking say, what the fuck just happened to you?  It's revving up an engine.  Yeah, like, are they telling you to go, like, Herm, you're too boring just being yourself? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Throw a little flavor flave in there.  That's great.  Do you do an hour without stopping?  Or will you, like, do a subject and go, ah, fuck it, I'm going to relax for a bit, pause.  No, I just wing it, and I start bombing.  Last podcast, he went after a bug and left us all just hanging there  as you were killing a fucking mosquito.  A moth.  A moth or something.  They eat your sweaters, Opie.  I have zero tolerance.  I have to get a cedar chest.  He even goes, I don't care if you guys leave.  What a horrible golf thing to get. 
[02:51:00]  Cedar chest.  Chest of drawers.  I don't care if you guys leave my podcast.  I've got to kill this moth.  And we're just all sitting there waiting for you to come back on mic.  It was funny, though.  Yelled it to the squirrels.  That's your dog.  My dog is doing phenomenally.  There was a panic out there when you're fucking tweeting about a lost dog.  Oh, man, I know.  We all thought it was your dog.  No, no, it was a friend of Nia's dog.  Totally thought that was your dog.  They found it?  Yeah, thank God.  Because coyotes take dogs out there, right?  Oh, yeah, but this was a pity, so they don't mess with them. 
[02:51:30]  Those coyotes are cowards.  Are they?  Yeah.  They don't go after the poodles?  Yeah, the gang beat down.  They always pick on something smaller.  You seen coyotes out there?  Yeah.  And it's amazing.  Are they scary?  Yeah, because they have that same look in their eye that a hooker does, where it's not a joke.  You know what I mean?  It's just, I will fuck you.  Of your money.  Yeah.  As opposed to that dick tease sort of thing.  They have that look on their face.  They're looking at you, sizing you up. 
[02:52:00]  Like, can I grab that thing by the throat and shake it and then eat it?  Ah, he's a little big.  He's a big butt.  But if I had a couple more friends, maybe, put a pin in that.  Maybe he'll come by tomorrow.  He'll have his back to us, putting out the trash.  Kind of look like a dog, so he's not completely threatened.  Yeah.  No, that's why I love my dog, because they just look at him and they're like, or her, I should say.  Sorry, I forget it.  Sure as hell isn't me, my Ron Howard face.  There's some shit out there in the hills of L.A., man.  I had no idea.  When I was spending some time out there, I would hike, and I saw the sign after the fact about the cougars and everything else that's on the trails. 
[02:52:30]  Fuck that.  I would have never went hiking if I read the sign ahead of time.  They always say there hasn't been any mountain lions.  Mountain lions, I should say.  Right.  Same thing, I think.  Right?  They haven't been any mountain lions there since the 1930s.  You know?  Right, yeah.  Just little rascals will make his movies, right?  That's what they try and say.  But then, like, every once in a while, you see in the news, they'll just be like, two mountain lion cubs found in the driveway under somebody's SUV.  Coming up next.  Now this.  Another cute little news story.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  I heard that when I was riding on a rental car bus.  Another high point in my career.  I was riding on it, and they were talking, 75 degrees, big traffic jam.  Then they go, and a python, the size of a bus.  Coming up next.  A bus.  And nobody even flinched.  Everyone's just saying.  It's like, really?  The size of a bus?  Really?  Why were you on the bus?  I was going over to get a rental car.  That was the beginning of the story, Opie, that you weren't listening to.  I said it was on the rental car bus.  Rental car.  Rental car bus.  The rental car bus.  Airport.  I didn't hear rental car.  I didn't hear car.  I heard rental bus, whatever.  When are you at Carolines, by the way? 
[02:53:30]  Bill's at Carolines.  July.  In July.  July what to what?  I don't know.  8th to 11th.  Just go to carolines.com or call them.  Just say Bill Burr in July.  It's probably one week.  They'll know.  Hey, are you guys coming through the West Coast with the tour?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  Is that the most insane lineup ever?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Murder is row.  Despicable murder is row.  It's actually this time it's DePaulo, me, Etel, and Artie.  Oh, I missed Stan Hope. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, no.  Stan Hope did some.  Nick is doing some because it's easy for him and Artie.  Stan Hope was great.  We're a fucking bad suit.  He's a psychopath.  He really is a psychopath.  I loved it.  He's a good show.  God damn it.  I miss everything.  Yeah.  So I don't know if we'll go out there.  We might.  So, Antony, I'm getting close to pulling the trigger.  No point intended.  I hear.  No pun intended.  No point intended either.  I hear.  That's such a moron.  I hear.  That's a...  You're going to carry?  I have a house now, and it's fucking unsettling. 
[02:54:30]  Yes.  Right?  I've been joking on stage that when you live in an apartment building, there's that relaxing  feeling to be around that many potential victims.  And you're like, yeah, I'm up on the fifth floor.  He's going to come all the way up here.  When he can get someone on the first?  Yeah.  And then you've got to run down five flights of stairs.  Cops are going to be there.  He's going to get somebody on the first couple of floors.  Dude, when you're in a house and it's just you, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  The world is on the other side of the door.  And it just freaks me out. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, yeah, that's it.  But what's her face?  What's her face?  Neil, when she sees that?  What's her face?  Nice.  I've got to be just to save my ass here.  I fucking...  I went out until like 2.30 in the morning last night drinking, so I'm on one leg here.  What's her face?  Jesus.  I hope she doesn't hear this.  Now some douche is going to send it to her.  Ah, yeah.  Let me ask you this.  Were you a gun guy growing up, or you've completely, you know, changed your opinion?  I was a gun guy as a little kid watching Cowboy and India movies. 
[02:55:30]  And then, you know, one time I went out and I shot a gun and didn't have earplugs on.  Shot a 5-shot .38.  Not a good idea.  After the first one went out, I just...  I couldn't hear anything, and I just unloaded the next...  Just want to get it over with.  I want to get it over with.  Do you get her to get a gun, too?  Like, are you going to have her take lessons?  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.  I mean, we did it with the dog.  We did it with the pit bull.  She could walk it through, like, a bunch of first graders holding, like, raw meat, and  I would not have a problem.  The dog would just be right next to her.  So I just figured the gun's the same thing.  But, yeah. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, what are you taking, safety cores and shit?  I'm too old to get a black belt in anything, so I want to get in the express lane.  Oh, that's funny.  I don't want to learn how to aim.  Just give me the shotgun in this general vicinity.  I'll catch his shoulder, at least.  Why, you?  Get out of my house!  I love the whole thing about the shotgun, where they say, you know, because the big urban  myth is all they hear is ch-ch-ch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's it.  Really?  Well, what if I hear two more on the other side of the door? 
[02:56:30]  Right.  Isn't that like the World Series of Poker?  I hear your shotgun, and I raise you a couple of machine guns.  All right, setting this thing down.  Yeah, you've got to have something ready to go in the shotgun.  Yeah, no, just, you know.  Chick, chick.  Are you looking for a pistol or a rifle or shotgun?  I just, look, I just want, if somebody is going to try to take me out, I would like  to go down with some sort of a fight.  And, dude, like, I live in a bankrupt state.  I live in a city that technically has no water supplies. 
[02:57:00]  I keep reading.  Marillion Stones just did, like, a five-page article on Bank of America, dude.  It was just, it was so criminal.  I heard Keith Robinson's voice laughing.  You know how he loves, like, evil stuff?  And then they did this to old people, and I just heard Keith going, yeah.  And I was just, dude.  Yeah, that's right, stupid.  Take it.  That's right, stupid.  Yeah.  What did they say?  Because I hate the Bank of America.  Dude, listen to the thing.  I'm so stupid.  I'm going to have to read it, like, five times, but it was just, it was the whole buildup 
[02:57:30]  to, you know, the whole bubble that they created, and then how nobody went to jail, and then  they got the bailout money, and then they kept it, and then how they charge you on the  ATMs.  It was just, all they were missing was that 1920s, like, mustache.  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, we're so close to losing money to have it in their banks.  You already are, really.  We're so close.  I took all my, or most of my money out of there and just invested it.  We're getting less than 1% in savings, basically.  And then fees are eating. 
[02:58:00]  And now the fees and the ATM thing.  No, and then if you just read up on money, it's like, it's legalized counterfeiting, and  they just keep printing more, and there's nothing behind it, and it's just, everybody believes  in the lie, but it's literally, it's just teetering.  You have to believe in the lie, because if you don't believe in it, then the whole thing  is fucked.  There's no gold behind this.  Ah, so what?  Here.  So what?  I can still give it and get a shirt for it.  Okay.  Yeah, it hasn't been on the gold standard in years, but the whole, the whole value is  that it's America.  No, as far as I can tell is that it's, it's, barrels per oil is still measured in U.S. 
[02:58:30]  dollars.  That somehow gives it value, which I don't understand.  Yeah, yeah.  But if it was somehow to flip and say euros per barrel, which is what old Saddam was trying  to do.  I guess he was getting together with old Hugo Chavez.  Oh, well.  And they were trying to get out from underneath.  Kind of that.  Yeah, we can't have that.  So then all of a sudden we were all concerned about the Iraqi people.  We need to defend their freedom.  Son of a bitch is going to bankrupt us.  When did we come off the gold standard?  I think officially, yeah, we did, but then like totally 100% Nixon signed something, according 
[02:59:00]  to my YouTube research.  Do not hold me on this.  That's more than I know about it.  But I know it's just supposed to, I mean, I like Ron Paul, and that's a big fucking rally cry  for Ron Paul.  I always love the crazy guy.  I don't vote Democrat or Republican.  Look at Obama, right?  Yeah.  First black president ever, Democrat.  This dude should be the most liberal guy ever.  Signs a defense package where now they can just arrest anybody without a trial and hold  you indefinitely just because they think you're a terrorist. 
[02:59:30]  That's like something Stalin would be like, standing up, doing the Arsenio, would totally  be applauding.  That just tells me that there has to be like...  Somebody else in charge.  Some higher power.  Yes.  Yeah, they got money on every horse that's running.  And it's just like...  That's unbelievable.  I'd like to know who the movers and shakers are.  Yeah, that's that classic Bill Hicks bit.  You go in there and they show you the Kennedy assassination from an angle you've never seen before.  Any questions? 
[03:00:00]  Any questions?  They take you to the basement of the White House?  Yeah.  Such a great bit.  Hey, Tony in Cleveland says, Bill Burr is a legend.  Tony, why is Bill Burr a legend?  Hey, guys.  He's going to trash me.  He goes to college and he's taking a course on public speaking.  And his professor was showing some famous speeches and people speaking.  And then he was trying to point out that no matter how bad your speech is going or how  uncomfortable you are, there's always a way out from underneath it. 
[03:00:30]  And he proceeds to show the whole class, you're a Philly stand-up where you just attack the  crowd and turn them.  Oh, wow.  In Philly, the famous fucking time.  I was going to say this completely wrong.  Bill Burr was not bombing that night.  It was just a weird fucking night.  Yes, I was.  Nah, but you were funny, though.  You were funny, though.  All right, technically you were bombing, but it had nothing to do with you and your material.  Yeah.  No, I started off with some stupid cell phone joke that bombed.  And then I ran to my next joke.  And that was the one that they were playing in the promos. 
[03:01:00]  Everyone heard it.  And then I bailed on it and go, well, you guys aren't going to laugh at that?  And then they just went, blah.  And that's what started it.  What I want to know is, it's on YouTube.  It's legendary.  But weren't we filming those fucking shows?  It was part of our virus show.  There's got to be a much better copy of that out there.  Well, I think that we had just allowed certain people to film or they wouldn't film without  getting paid.  Steve C., I guess.  I don't know.  Maybe.  No, I'm talking about the production.  I thought we were.  The production guys.  Oh, that's a good question.  No, I don't think it was Steve C.  I'm talking about the production guys. 
[03:01:30]  I thought they were filming with the hope of maybe we could figure something out down  the road.  I would love to know that because it would be great if there was a better copy out there.  Sitting in a vault somewhere.  I think it might be.  There's no vaults anymore.  You know, it's probably on somebody's laptop that they just threw out, donated to a school.  Oh, my God.  I have tapes.  I have little fucking those minis.  Yeah.  Tapes.  Right before, you know, you were able to get the card.  Sure.  And I have a lot of road shows on there.  So, I don't know.  It might be on one of mine.  What do you mean?  I know I was.  I used to go around, remember, backstage and shit. 
[03:02:00]  On film, yeah.  I was videoing, like, everything.  But somebody has a good copy of Bill Burr just beating the shit out of that crowd.  And by the end of it, for the people that, I can't imagine there's people that still  don't know what happened, but Bill Burr got a standing ovation by the end of it.  That's what made that so amazing.  Because he took on the entire crowd, and they wanted to take him out.  And by the end, they were fucking standing up and applauding.  That wasn't amazing.  It was fun.  And then Jimmy went out and acted like nothing happened.  Right.  Went right into his material and absolutely destroyed. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  To me, that was equally amazing.  Because I remember when I got off, you said, Opie walks by, he goes, that was one for the  ages, bro.  And I'm already wondering, like, how is this going to be taken?  Am I going to be humiliated and all that?  And then I walked back, and I saw Jimmy standing there, and I felt like a selfish ass for burning  down the whole room.  And I was like, sorry about that.  Jimmy's like, hey, don't worry about it.  And just goes out there, and I was like, hey, how's everybody doing?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Like he was on The Tonight Show.  Went right into his material and destroyed.  Yeah, that worked out okay. 
[03:03:00]  Sam, maybe play it on The After Show if the quality's good enough.  I don't know.  But I feel like there's a better copy out there somewhere, so we should try to hunt it down.  I kind of like that it's just blurry.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  It kind of fits the whole thing.  It fits the whole mood of that thing.  So, Tony, they're really playing that in your son's college class there, huh?  Yeah, they didn't have the video.  He said it was just an audio clip.  Right.  So they didn't get to see the video.  But my son, he went with me once to see Burr when he was in Cleveland.  And he's like, yeah, because that guy's a madman. 
[03:03:30]  The professor's like, oh, so you've heard this?  He goes, no, I wasn't there, but I've heard it.  Yeah, it's legendary.  What is it on YouTube there, Sam?  That's only one of the copies.  This one has almost a million views.  I've seen other copies that have like five, six, seven million views.  If you look up...  Oh, wow, really?  Oh, yeah.  This thing is...  It just keeps spreading out there.  If you look up Bill Burr, Philly.  Yeah, just look up Bill Burr, Philly.  All right.  Bill Burr fails.  That's what always gets the most.  Fail.  Yeah.  Anything with fail on it, yeah.  If you kill on a late-night talk show, no one's going to see it.  But if you slip and fall off the stage, that's a hundred million hits. 
[03:04:00]  This guy, Jake, you guys were talking about hecklers.  Yes.  And then just audience...  This guy has a question about hecklers, I guess, in general.  Go ahead, Jake.  Yeah, yeah.  I was at Rich Ross and Bonnie's show in Arlington two weeks ago.  And Bonnie said, what do you guys want to talk about?  And I said, how about John Stamos?  And I don't know.  She didn't like the question, the answer very much. 
[03:04:30]  And then Rich came out and he was saying some stuff.  Was it funny stuff?  Yeah, some of it.  We'll say some of it.  Are you about to say that you raised your voice twice in one comedy show?  Yeah, a couple of times.  Like Rich said...  Sir, why?  ...something about me and my wife, right?  And I said, well, your wife hates you.  And he's like, okay, we get it, dude.  You listen to Opie and Anthony.  You know, he said, that's a show I put on there. 
[03:05:00]  It's not real.  Oh, really?  Yeah, exactly.  So, you know, he was getting kind of irritated with me, but...  Irritated with your call.  What was the next thing you said, Bill?  So tentative.  I can't remember.  I had too many drinks.  Exactly.  You're making Bill Burr and Jim Norton's point.  Yeah.  They don't really like when you comment about the show because they're trying to do their thing.  So it's like interrupting their show. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, there's no reason for it.  It's like, occasionally, I very rarely, one out of 50 times somebody pipes up, it's charming and fun.  The other 49 times, I want to behead them.  Yeah, it says on the screen here, what's the difference between a heckler and someone who is commenting during the show?  That's a good question.  You shouldn't talk during the show.  Unless, like, I'll say sometimes, like, hey, is anybody into, like, sexual role play?  Like, I like to hear sometimes the answer is what people have done.  That's a question I'm asking.  And then nobody talks. 
[03:06:00]  It's also, like, I think it's very obvious.  I think it's very obvious when you guys are doing your acting, you need kind of complete focus.  You're in your thing.  Sure.  And then there are times you kind of open it up to the venue.  I've seen that.  All you guys do.  Then it's pretty obvious that they're kind of now fooling around with the crowd.  And, you know, then maybe they want you to comment or say something.  I don't mind, like, heckling as far as, like, if someone wants to try and get me.  But if you just, but once it goes beyond, like, to that obnoxious level, you're just not going to shut up. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  Then it gets to the point of, like, okay, well, I can just stand here and go back and forth with you.  Right.  But people kind of paid to see the show.  So, like, it just gets to that point.  But I don't, you know, sometimes, like, I always hear, you know, certain comics will just say stuff like, you know, do they heckle when you're in a Broadway show?  It's like, dude, you're not on Broadway.  Right.  Okay?  You're in a funny bar.  Right.  You know what I mean?  You know, people pay, like, $90 a ticket.  I was on Broadway and they heckled.  I'm jealous. 
[03:07:00]  Literally, we're on Broadway.  Wait a minute.  All right, Jake.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  They think for some reason, like, comedians are the only ones who get heckled.  Bands get shit thrown at them.  George Bush got shoes thrown at them.  If you stand with a microphone talking to a group of people, you basically should be sitting on a dunking stool because it is going to happen.  Did you ever get a heckler that absolutely got you?  Because you guys are professionals and you pretty much have heard it all and I've seen every situation.  Absolutely.  But you got a story of one that they really did get you?  The first eight years of my career, like, I had a 50-50 chance. 
[03:07:30]  Of getting out of it?  Yeah, or getting owned.  Like, when I first came down to New York, my suburban cul-de-sac point of view.  My Dockers, I mean, it was bad.  And they just smelled the fear and they would get on me and I would just hear tables.  The worst was when I couldn't even hear what they were saying.  I would hear them murmuring.  And then the urban, that duck laugh. 
[03:08:00]  And I'm like, oh, God, here we go.  They're coming at me.  I'm done.  They're laughing at me, not with me.  It was brutal.  Yeah.  But now there's not a chance.  I've seen all you guys.  When I see a heckler, I'm like, oh, this guy has no idea what he's getting himself into.  No, but still, if I'm in a bad mood, you can get me because I'll already have kind of pissed the crowd off and stuff.  I guess, you know.  You get too mean too fast.  Too mean too fast and people don't like, and if it's just, you know, like one of those guest spot nights.  So no one gives a shit that it's you. 
[03:08:30]  And, you know, Colin was just up, so why would they give a fuck about me?  And then I'm up there acting like I'm fucking the grand pooper, you know?  And I'm being a dick and I'm saying bad things about women.  And then someone heckles me and the crowd doesn't have my back.  So then I'll say, hey, why don't you go fuck yourself, crickets, crickets.  You know?  Yeah.  You can stop.  Yeah.  Colin loves to go over ways to hammer hecklers, like we're upstairs at the cellar.  Like if someone yells out, he's like, hey, could you keep it down to a dull roar?  Or, you know, hey. 
[03:09:00]  Hey, sir.  That Colin thing.  Really awful, awful heckle lines.  Funniest man on Twitter.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm not even going to say why because I don't want to ruin it.  No, it's hilarious.  I know.  It's fucking hilarious.  It's amazing how many dummies are out there.  It's amazing, right?  Did you see how we said New York City needs a good dose of Christianity?  Yes.  Some lady writes, that's the last fucking thing.  Yeah.  I like I don't give a care.  I don't.  I-D-A-C.  I-D-A-C.  He just goes, I-D-A-C.  I-D-G-A-C.  I don't give a care. 
[03:09:30]  Did you see when you wrote CQ's recipe for success?  Oh, yeah.  Those are great.  What was it?  It was a pair of brass.  It's fucking-  You know what?  It's my favorite tweet anyone sent out.  Sam, just find CQ's recipe for success.  What does it say?  CQ's recipe for success.  You know what I loved, too, was-  It's hilarious.  Did you see his one on The Office?  Who's that guy who was on for a season and was leaving?  You know, the guy from Less Than Zero?  Uh, David-  Uh, Dom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, fuck.  Uh, I can never remember his name. 
[03:10:00]  Huh?  Hold on.  James Spader.  Yeah, James Spader.  James Spader.  So he tweeted, James Spader's leaving The Office.  He goes, gee, I wonder who they're going to get to replace him.  Gee, I wonder.  And then he goes, hashtag fat paycheck.  And then all these people wrote, you really think they're going to fucking cast you?  Like, losing their minds.  Here I am, saying what he's doing.  I should shut up.  That's right.  That's hilarious.  CQ recipe for success slash dinner.  One half cup of brass.  You know what's a tablespoon of I don't give a care and a pound of get off my back, Jack. 
[03:10:30]  He's brilliant, man.  A tablespoon of I don't give a care.  That guy is brilliant.  What a fucking horrible thing.  It's I am Colin Quinn on Twitter.  He really took to Twitter, man.  He found his niche.  It's the best angle.  It's great.  It's so fucking great.  Because in the end, Twitter's all bullshit.  Yeah, what are you going to do on there?  What are we supposed to stop tweeting?  Get into the same Second Amendment arguments I get into every fucking night? 
[03:11:00]  The fucking Goodfellas with health care thing that just made me laugh.  Let me just do like this Goodfellas alliance with our health care system.  Oh, is that great?  Did you see when he was casting Tough Crowd the movie?  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody tweeted the part of Bill Burr will be played by Cynthia Nixon.  Jesus.  That's pretty good.  Do people beat up your hybrid because it's a hybrid?  What do you mean? 
[03:11:30]  I was listening to your podcast.  It seems like you have a lot of problems with your hybrid.  And it seems like people just get angry when they see hybrid cars out there and feel like  they have to do something to it.  No, the shit keeps happening to my car, though.  Yeah.  Somebody broke the window sitting in the driveway.  Yeah.  Yeah, broke into it.  I think they saw the cord hanging out, so they thought maybe there was an iPod in there.  And all there was was a bag of corders for the parking meter.  And they took that, which really fucking bugs me.  Because they're walking, well, at least I got something.  Yeah, right.  That's fucking annoying me.  At least I got something. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  No, that's really bugging me.  Because they're annoyed.  You know, if they break your window, they expect at least to come away with something.  Oh, you know what kills me, too, is they break the window.  And rather than just opening the glove box, they got to rip it open.  It's like it wasn't locked.  Right.  All right, you fucking movie criminal guy thinks you got to do this.  Could you at least make it easy for me after you leave?  The console thing, yeah.  You like just bent it back like Joe Theismann's leg coming at you.  Just twist it.  It's violating, isn't it?  When they sting your shit.  Just picturing that douche. 
[03:12:30]  Sitting in your fucking shit.  You got to see my opening in five minutes.  I'm talking about like fantasies of shooting the guy.  You know, not center mass.  I want to get him in the leg so he doesn't die.  But every time it rains, he remembers it.  He feels it.  Should have never done that.  It is so violating.  You're right, Jimmy.  Yeah, I had my car broken into once.  And I knew the guy was going to do it.  Because I used to tuck.  I used to carry one of those little fag bags around your waist.  They put a little walk.  And I had my...  Fanny pack.  Fanny pack.  And I was putting it under the seat.  And I saw some fucking homeless guy notice me. 
[03:13:00]  Just lean.  And I'm like, move your car, stupid.  You know the rules.  He saw you do that.  Right.  Came back later.  It was fucking wrecked by the sun.  Oh.  Years ago.  I would never do that again.  He just knew.  He knew.  You knew, too.  But I saw him see me.  I deserved it.  You fell for it.  Yeah, I sure did.  Thank God nobody was hurt.  Am I right or wrong?  Exactly.  Hey, that's a good premise, though, for Chip.  You know, why do they call it a fanny pack when they wear it in the front?  Ah.  I don't get it.  And how come it's a fanny pack if it's not one?  I'll use that one.  Oh, God. 
[03:13:30]  Then he does that.  Yeah, isn't that horrible?  The push.  I love and hate Chip.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's perfect.  The same time.  But it's 99% love.  No, it's really not.  Bill, are you in town for a couple days?  No, I fly out.  Today?  Yeah.  Ah.  I swung by to say hello to my old buddies.  My old buddies.  Damn you.  Dude, I always try to call on the show, and you guys never fucking pick up.  What?  What is it?  Are you screening my calls?  Is that what it is?  No, we want Bill Burr phone calls, so I don't know if I believe you. 
[03:14:00]  You got the right number?  I'll have to check during the break.  Yeah, we'd love two numbers.  I have two numbers.  I have two numbers from you.  It says O&A Hotline.  All right.  Let's make sure you got the right number.  I finally just got the hotline number.  You did?  I've been calling Sam using the regular number, but easy to get through.  No one on that fucking phone.  No one calling up Sam's show.  I would heckle Bill real good at his show.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  What'd you say?  Hey, Bill Burr, what are you called or something, Burr? 
[03:14:30]  Oh, God.  He's terrible at his face.  He said nothing.  No, you got him that time, Chip.  Just notice he's adding that annoying laugh after him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That, and then the hand pounding on the fucking console.  Hey, nice egg sandwich.  What, are there chickens in there or something?  Oh, that, that, I don't know what it is.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute, the show's over.  Back in my bags.  It's always bad when you're talking and you see Anthony wrapping the cord. 
[03:15:00]  I'm rodeeing my fucking computer.  He's not fucking around today.  I got him.  I got the big pool opening today.  It's technically a...  Fucking A, man.  Pool is open.  Today, motherfuckers.  Yay.  That's right.  When I come back in July.  Yeah.  July is the next time I'm going to see you.  No, no.  I mean, most likely another time.  Go out to Calvary and get the heavy artillery out.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to check out your compound.  Yeah.  Have you ever been to his house?  Never.  It's great, dude.  Oh, fuck, man.  Never been.  Pretty impressive.  You got to fucking go. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  Got the pool opening up today.  He's fucking a killer.  I always pictured it like half Tony Soprano, half Cheesecake Factory.  Or like some sort of water slide.  Not too off.  It definitely has a Tony Soprano thing to it.  I love it.  Yeah, it definitely has that kind of vibe going on.  Tony, look at your house.  You've made it.  What the fuck do you do?  Yeah.  He's crying because the fucking ducks are there.  The ducks.  And they're leaving.  And he wants to shoot them. 
[03:16:00]  Great scene.  I was watching that yesterday on A&E.  They actually do a good job for a channel that they can't use the language that the Sopranos normally use.  They try to fuck it up.  Yeah, I guess they took the second.  They did both lines, the dirty one and the clean one, when they filmed it.  So it's not really fucking crazy to see them saying freaking instead of fucking.  And you know what they were saying anyway.  I'd rather see it with the curses.  But it's not as horrible as Mr. Falcon.  The famous Mr. Falcon. 
[03:16:30]  Yes.  Bill Burr podcast.  Monday morning podcast.  Doing very well.  I suggest you check it out.  Yes, sir.  Bill Burr on Twitter.  Any other gigs coming up?  I don't know.  I don't have much this month.  I got a college that's open to the public on April 27th.  Whoa.  Wow.  That's unusual.  It's in New Hampshire.  The great state.  I've never done a gig up there.  It's nice, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that the Boston market or is that like a little bit out of it?  It depends.  You don't want to cannibalize the Boston. 
[03:17:00]  I can't cannibalize it.  Oh, I know what you're saying.  If it's right over the border, it's kind of Boston still.  No, I think it's far enough away.  Now you got me worried.  No, you'll be fine up there, man.  Why am I going to drive all the way down there when I can just see them in New Hampshire?  I can see them over here.  Fucking Bruins.  You think they got a shot or what?  I don't know.  I'm going Flyers.  I got it for the in-laws.  My team's out, so I got to pick a team.  How great was that game yesterday?  I only tuned it in the last five minutes. 
[03:17:30]  And we're talking about the Penguins Flyers.  Holy fuck.  You see the coaches almost go at it?  It was everything that makes hockey great and makes most people not like hockey because  they think it's barbaric.  I love it.  I absolutely love it.  The coaches almost went at it yesterday.  How funny is Hartnell?  Hartnell is one of the funniest guys.  He's old school.  He's one of the funniest.  He's unbelievable.  He can score goals and just annoy the shit out of the other team.  Yeah, he's old school.  I should hate him as a Bruins fan.  Sorry, I'm eating a fucking sandwich here.  That's okay.  Nah, you know what?  You got to smoke those guys. 
[03:18:00]  You're eating.  Ty Domi.  Domi.  Ty Domi.  Domi, right?  Ty Domi.  I used to love that guy, even when he was beating up my team.  How do you not love a guy like that?  No, did you see him doing the Hulk Hogan putting his hand up to his ear as people are throwing  stuff at him?  It's just like, you got to love that guy.  That's all old school 70s shit.  Yeah, but Bruins finally beat the Rangers last night, but the Rangers look tough.  The Rangers are real tough this year.  Yeah.  But they're the Rangers.  I know.  You know?  Are they going to do something? 
[03:18:30]  Anthony, I'll see you later.  I got to go.  I know.  I understand.  Yeah, you got other things to do.  He's got the pool thing.  Jesus.  I actually have an appointment.  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy's got something.  Wait a minute.  Look at this whole London fog look.  I love it.  I got tired of going to...  I'm wearing like a gentleman's coat because I got tired of going to events with a suit  jacket and my fucking...  I have that same horrible coat that Sherrod Small has, that fucking bomber jacket.  So I had to get a gentleman's coat.  Yeah, you know, if you're going to wear a sweater, you're looking, I would say, dapper. 
[03:19:00]  Thank you.  He wears a lot of sweaters now.  Yeah.  He's the sweater boy cutie.  You know.  You know how Weight Watchers works.  You know?  You lose a little bit.  Yeah.  He's looking good for his special.  I'm out of here.  That was such a creepy squeeze of the pinky.  All right, Jimmy.  We can go to it, I guess.  Now, let's talk a little hockey.  Well...  A little bonus time.  Well, my fucking Islanders suck, so I have to pick a team.  Dude, are they going to leave?  They're going to leave next time?  I think they are.  But they got another, I think, another year, maybe two years left on the lease.  I think they are at this point.  You know how insane that would be, that, like, a team that won four in a row was a dynasty 
[03:19:30]  and all that.  Right.  It just...  I can't believe they can't figure it out.  I just can't believe it.  I hope they move to Brooklyn or closer to, like, the old Shea Stadium.  There's rumors of doing something like that.  That would be cool.  But if the Islanders leave, then I have to pick another team.  It would kill me to pick the Rangers.  And you've hated everybody in the old Patrick division your whole life.  Of course.  I kind of...  I mean, I...  You know, Philly at this point is my second home for the last, like, eight years, so  I don't have as much of a problem now rooting for the Flyers now that the Islanders are out. 
[03:20:00]  Dude, I...  But I couldn't do that on a regular basis.  I always feel so bad for sports.  I can't imagine if the Bruins ever left Boston.  I was just trying to think who I would have rooted for.  Who would you go for?  All right.  The closest teams, Canadians.  Forget about that.  Right.  That's never happening.  Then you got...  Then you got New York teams.  Or a Buffalo.  I would...  I actually...  Buffalo's an easy one.  I could go Buffalo.  Nah, fuck Buffalo.  I could go Buffalo.  I still hate them from back when they had Foligno with that stupid Racer X hat they used to 
[03:20:30]  wear.  Tom Barrasso.  Was he on that team?  A lot of the Western New Yorkers...  Lindy Ruff.  I don't remember the...  Oh, yeah.  I remember that name.  But a lot of the Western New Yorkers go to Boston to vacation.  So there is a kind of connection there.  I...  This is weird as this might sound.  I would go...  I like the Flyers.  And I do like the Rangers because of 1994.  Because watching somebody break a curse and I was finally...  Like just a Red Sox fan.  I was like watching that.  And you know, Mark Messier.  I thought that that was awesome. 
[03:21:00]  That kind of...  And everybody stole...  But that kind of fucked our channel over.  Our Islanders had a great chant.  1940.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  1994.  But they say 1980.  Three, yeah.  Yeah, three.  You don't want to bring it up when they've won once earlier.  Nah.  We've got to wait now.  No, but everybody stole their Let's Go Rangers chant.  Let's go Rangers.  Sure.  Even when I go to a Bruins game, they go, Let's go Bruins.  It was never that when I was growing up.  It was, Here we go, Bruins.  Here we go.  And the whole rafters would be shaking.  And...  Do you realize the 94 is now 18 years ago? 
[03:21:30]  Yep.  I realize we're old.  Seems like yesterday.  Yep.  Seems like yesterday the Rangers finally did it.  That's 18 years ago already.  Yeah.  And how long was their curse?  54 years.  54.  1940, before that.  They went 1940, then 1994.  They're not going to go another 54 years.  They, you know...  They got a strong chance of winning it this year.  Fuck.  Did you see that whole thing on that goaltender there?  No.  Henrik Lundqvist?  No.  Yeah, I didn't realize he was such a...  Oh, on...  Yeah, movie star-looking guy.  On 24-7, you mean?  Yeah, they had this whole thing. 
[03:22:00]  I just thought he was another fat guy.  Oh, no, no.  Goalies, to me, are always fat guys.  Yeah.  Because that's what they were.  The fat kid always played goalie.  Yeah.  The spaz played right field.  Right.  Right?  There was places you went.  Well, the goalie was always a little funny.  You had to be a little fucking funny to stand up for the pucks.  Sort of an alcohol problem.  Yeah, exactly.  Dude, I got to tell you something, man.  I've been playing.  I took up the game...  I heard you in the podcast.  ...about a year and a half ago, dude.  I don't know what happened the last two times I played.  A couple of things put together. 
[03:22:30]  I still suck, but I feel like I'm on the upper level of sucking at this point.  I lean like upper middle class.  I'm like upper sucking.  Right.  And...  All of a sudden, you're in the zone?  It all kind of...  No, obviously.  You know what it was?  Dude, I'm such a psycho.  I was watching on YouTube coaches who coach hockey coaches, and I was watching the videos.  Because the biggest thing that you have when you're out there, aside from how do I skate  and stick handle at the same time, which I still can't do.  I'm terrible at that.  But the other big question I have is, where the fuck am I supposed to be? 
[03:23:00]  You know what I mean?  Just the basics.  Yeah, when you go in the offensive zone, I always see the defensemen who are at the blue lines.  But, you know...  You can't go in too deep.  All of that.  No idea where to be, and I just watched a couple of these things about them cycling  the puck around, and a couple of things on breakouts, and all of a sudden, the last  time I played, someone said, hey, you know, you're a pretty good positional player.  Oh, really?  So they didn't notice.  You're the kind of way you're supposed to be, and then we give you the puck, and you  turn it over instantaneously.  I would assume that everyone didn't know where they were. 
[03:23:30]  You know what would be hilarious is if you could somehow hook up something to test my  heart rate and watch how high up it goes when the puck is passed to me.  Because I just have somebody's coming, and I have to look down when I have the puck.  You're just panicking?  I compare it to, like, texting while driving.  So I'm sitting there, and I've got to look so I don't lose it.  It's like, how long can I look down before someone fucking creeps me?  And people know I panic, too, because whenever the puck comes near me, people are always like,  plenty of time, Bill!  You've got plenty of time!  And I immediately just try to send it around the boards, and someone else takes it and  goes in for a goal.  How is that, though?  You're in your 40s, right? 
[03:24:00]  43.  43.  So how is it to go back to one of your sports you loved in your 40s?  Well, I only played pond hockey and that type of thing, you know, but the great thing...  It's something you just enjoy, is what I'm saying.  Dude, it's phenomenal, and I've got to tell you what the great thing is, is because I'm  so old, I can't run anymore unless, like, my life is in danger, right?  Right.  It's just my back, my knees, everything kills me, but something about skating, it's not  like you're not stomping your feet, so it's not, like, high impact.  Right.  And you still feel fast, because you can skate way faster than you could ever run, even  though you're the slowest guy on the ice, your jersey's still blowing in the breeze. 
[03:24:30]  Right.  I'm telling you.  See, because my sport was basketball, and at my gym, they just pick up games all the  time, and I'm like, just do it, dummy.  These guys out there I know are older than me, and I would fucking enjoy it.  You should do it.  And I still shoot around, you know, and I just enjoy doing it.  Definitely do it.  Then you get on it.  I'm going to join a league.  Are you?  Yeah, I got to do it.  Because I got leagues at my gym, too.  I'm like, why not?  Why not?  You know?  Hey, did you see that picture?  I don't know if it's Photoshop, but it's funny either way.  The Bruins one?  Yeah.  That went around yesterday?  Oh, it was hilarious. 
[03:25:00]  What does it say again?  I wish there was some girl holding up a sign to Tyler Sagan who's like the young heart  throbbing.  I tweeted yesterday.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  It said, I wish I only got two minutes for hooking.  Oh, no.  There was another one about we blew you in high school.  Did you see that one?  No.  It's on my timeline, OP Radio.  I'll get a cheap plug in there.  Go way back, because I had to fucking live tweet the Country Music Awards yesterday.  Yeah, I think it said something like, we blew you in high school.  But then someone had to ruin it for me.  I'd say, oh, that's Photoshop. 
[03:25:30]  That website photoshops those signs all the time.  Oh, so because you know something?  It looked pretty real to me.  It didn't look real.  This is why it didn't look real to me, because he was wearing the Away jersey.  Right.  Sagan's wearing the Away jersey, and the entire crowd is Bruins fans.  Like, the whole crowd.  So I thought it was Photoshop.  Oh, okay.  It's still funny.  It's still funny.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Yeah, but you want to think somebody actually came up with that, and Tyler Sagan's actually  really laughing at that.  Yeah, why don't we do that?  Start a new trend.  Just come up with these dumb signs for real. 
[03:26:00]  Well, why don't you give away two pairs of tickets along the glass once a month, right?  Let's do it.  And then you just, whoever comes up with it.  You have a contest, whoever comes up with the best sign.  No, but then the NHL will be looking for it.  Well, we used to get signs in the wrestling events and stuff, so it's not too far-fetched.  We might have to go old school and start doing that again.  Are we even doing radio at this point?  Are we just sitting here brainstorming ideas?  I haven't talked to you in a while.  It's good.  You know what I think would be funny?  I can't wait for playoff hockey, though. 
[03:26:30]  I tweeted yesterday, the Penguins flyers.  See, that's one sport.  They have to play each other.  Both of them better win until they play each other.  I think they've got a rematch this week.  I think they've got to play one more time.  They play Saturday.  And the game might matter, right?  Because they only have a couple points between them as far as the top seed goes, right?  Yeah.  I think.  So they have to play hard still.  That could get ugly.  I got this weird thing where I love the Flyers, but I hate their fans.  Because one time I went to a Bruins game with my mother, and they were so obnoxious.  And Bruins fans aren't? 
[03:27:00]  Oh, don't.  No, no, no, no, no.  I mean, Philly takes the cake.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm giving them respect here.  Right.  Because when I really think of all the stuff they were saying, it was absolutely hilarious.  But I was there with my mom.  I'm trying to enjoy the game.  And I don't know what it is.  I don't know what it is.  But I've always loved the Flyers.  And then I got this weird thing where I have so many friends who are Penguins fans.  But I just hate the Penguins because I just think that we lost Neely and Savard, career-ending injuries, to those sons of bitches. 
[03:27:30]  So I just can't like them.  I'm starting to have more respect for Crosby.  And I know that's almost sacrilege.  No, he's awesome.  The guy fucking keeps getting up.  You know, they called him a pussy for a while there.  But now he's fucking taking concussions and he's getting right back in there.  He took that fucking puck to the nose the other day.  You see that?  Yeah.  Dude, nobody who plays professional hockey is a pussy.  I'm starting to have a little more respect for the guy.  Because it's so easy to just hate on him as being a pussy.  But I see him taking some pretty good hits lately.  He took a pretty good hit at the end of the game yesterday. 
[03:28:00]  You know what it is?  It's those big pouty lips.  That's what gets them.  Yeah.  You know, he's got those.  But that 24-7 does it, too.  Whatever team they feature, I start liking.  You've watched the 24-7.  I start liking them for whatever reason.  I even started finding myself liking the Rangers a little bit.  That Oveskin one was weird, though, how he still lives with his parents.  Really strange.  What's that about?  Yeah.  He's almost like...  Get a house for your parents close by.  Whatever.  He was coming off like a pothead.  Like his mom was cooking for him and stuff. 
[03:28:30]  And it's just like, you're one of the best guys in the league.  What's going on?  It was like a combination of funny and then just kind of weird.  You want to say, look, you're Oveskin.  I think, if I remember this correctly, he was playing video games while his mom was cooking  him dinner downstairs.  I'm like, hey, that sounds like a great luxury.  But the fact is, you're still in your mom's house.  Yeah.  All that was missing was his dad coming in going like, did you look for a job today?  I'm not right.  Dad, I'm gonna.  You know, this stupid hockey thing's not going to last forever, you know. 
[03:29:00]  You know what's going to find out?  He's probably getting blackmailed by some psycho back home.  That's no joke.  Russians are no joke.  Living out on the West Coast, I'll tell you, the two people...  Oh, I'm scared of Russians.  When you look at them, Armenians and Russians, those are like the pit bulls of white people.  Right.  They should have a tough man competition where the two of them just go at it.  I was saying that on my podcast.  Have Dana White put that together.  The just toughest civilian, just something tough as do...  Dude, all those Armenian guys, they all got their head shaved.  They all look like they could put you in an armbar, choke you out. 
[03:29:30]  I completely agree.  Superman punch.  I would not fuck with any of them.  I see...  I even see the Russian dads at the park with their kids.  They're...  Even at a dumb playground, they're intimidating as hell.  Oh, yeah.  I pray that my kid doesn't get in a little thing with the Russian kid, because I know  I'm going to have to deal with the Russian dad, who's way more intimidating than the fucking...  Give you some old world headbutt that you never get up from.  Than the dork that wears his Yankees cap and thinks he's something, you know...  On his Jordan shorts. 
[03:30:00]  All that shit.  Those fucking guys are easy.  It's the Russians with that fucking blank stare.  I'm like, what is he thinking?  Yeah.  I got to go, or my ride's going to leave.  I hear you.  Bill Burr?  God, I hope Kenny's still there.  You think he left on me?  Probably.  Hey, I want to thank everyone who came out to my shows down in Wilmington.  I was performing with Joey Roses, Teen Idol Sensation from your wonderful program.  And, uh...  Well, he took your spot.  You know that.  Huh?  He did take my spot.  I groomed him.  We missed the Bill Burr on this show.  And then...  You brought him in, and then...  Well, you know... 
[03:30:30]  Joey...  Why don't you guys start taking my calls?  Well, we got to make sure you got the right hotline numbers.  I mean...  It says ONA hotline in my phone.  In all fairness, fucking Joe does a great job for us.  Really.  I fucking love when Joe comes in, too.  Listen, Opie, I don't want to hear about your new girlfriend.  All right?  Well, what are you going to do?  I'm back in town.  Tell him to take the couch.  You're leaving today.  Thanks a lot.  I usually get you for a couple days.  All right, Bill Burr.  I'll be here in July, so the whole week doing Caroline's, but I'll be back before then.  That'll be great.  Bill Burr's podcast is really good.
