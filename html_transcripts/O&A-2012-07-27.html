<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about one host's awkward encounters with a man possessing a large port wine stain on his face.  This led to a broader, uncomfortable conversation about navigating interactions with people who have visible differences, and the hostsâ€™ own anxieties about public appearances given their show's notoriety. A caller, Ryan, shared a heartbreaking story about his six-year-old daughter's extensive port wine stain, prompting one host to express regret over their earlier jokes. The conversation then shifted to producer "Handsome Rob" and his supposedly embellished sexual conquests.  The show then reacted with anger and disgust to a viral video depicting a nine-year-old assaulting toddlers at a daycare. This sparked a debate about parental responsibility, daycare safety, and the hosts' responses to Twitter criticism of their sarcastic reaction to the video.  The discussion broadened to include the general anxieties of urban parenting and the difficulties of finding reliable childcare. The segment concluded with a discussion about a disappointing weather event, the hosts' changing drinking habits, Prince William's hairline, and the exciting news that Aaron Lewis of Staind was performing nearby, leading to speculation about a potential guest appearance.

The next segment began with a discussion of Aaron Lewis's country song, "Country Boy," featuring George Jones and Charlie Daniels.  This segued into a nostalgic debate about Southern rock bands, covering Molly Hatchet, 38 Special, Outlaws, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Marshall Tucker Band, and others.  The hosts shared strong (and often opposing) opinions on these bands and their music, touching on Confederate flags and providing a crude description of the Ozark Mountain Daredevils' sound.  After playing "Country Boy," they addressed listener feedback criticizing Lewis as a "sellout," comparing him to Kid Rock and Nickelback, particularly Kid Rock's "All Summer Long."  A portion of "All Summer Long" was played, prompting reminiscences about a past relationship nicknamed "Anthelini," involving Jill Nicolini and a reference to Brangelina.  The hosts then expressed their disdain for their workplace, focusing on a specific area they avoided due to negative past experiences.  The segment ended with a lengthy, detailed dissection of their dislike for Staind's "It's Been a While," with one host explaining the circumstances behind his aversion, linking it to his simultaneous feelings about Tool's music.  Joe DeRose was a guest in the studio, and Otto and George were mentioned as upcoming guests.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Good morning. Friday morning.  Friday morning.  That's nice.  Friday, really?  I know, right?  Nice.  Ain't that nice when you finally realize, ah, Friday morning.  Friday morning.  Friday fucking morning.  Friday morning.  Can I talk about port wine stains?  Oh, Jesus.  I decided, fuck it, I gotta bring this to the show. 
[00:00:30]  Might be offending people out there.  Are you still allowed to make fun of people that have port wine stains?  No.  No?  I don't think so.  I don't know, that's gotta be a bitch, man.  Wow.  There's nothing you can really do about that.  Well.  There is no God.  Let's just put it this way.  Yeah.  Something I have to do on a regular basis?  Uh-huh.  Involves, uh, going into a establishment. 
[00:01:00]  Ah.  And front and center is a guy with a massive port wine stain, and you gotta make believe  you don't notice it.  Oh, Jesus.  And every day, every, it's a couple times a week, and I have to fucking go through this  fake shit.  Like, oh, yeah, you're just a normal guy, right?  Yeah.  Hey, what's that on your face, man?  Right.  Hey, it's strawberry.  And this thing, uh, tends to ooze at times, in places. 
[00:01:30]  How does it ooze?  It's the entire left side of his face.  Wow.  And I'm not that good of an actor.  I try.  Yeah, you gotta be an actor.  That's weird.  I try.  Everyone's gotta act.  I understand.  We're all equal in this new world.  Fuck that shit, by the way.  Bullshit.  Yeah.  It's one of the big problems, uh, we have in America.  And then, this guy's front and center for this business.  And I'm thinking, if I'm running a business, Port Wine and Sting Guy, I'm sorry.  I don't care if your personality's good.  You're scaring the customers.  You're freaking them out. 
[00:02:00]  It's a thing where, like you said, you gotta now become an actor.  And some people don't act very well.  And it's difficult to look, uh, just at eyes.  And then you look like, then you're looking at the eyes too much.  Yes.  Because you don't want to look at the, uh, oh my goodness.  And, and, and.  Wow.  Yeah.  And there's a pressure.  That's, that's just.  And in all fairness to the guy, cause I, I have a feeling he's a fan of the show.  Oh boy.  I don't give a fuck.  We gotta talk about our shit.  You know, we gotta talk about our shit. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  That's why I don't like going out in public too much.  Cause then I run into people and I'm like, oh fuck, you're a fan of the show.  I was going to talk about you tomorrow.  Shit.  Yeah.  Um, it's rough.  He's a really nice guy too.  Yeah.  And he's jovial.  Yeah.  I think he makes believe he's over it.  Really?  That he's just living his life.  And he's cool with the fact he probably gets no pussy whatsoever.  How does that happen?  Huh?  God.  Sam's scrolling through some pictures of people with it. 
[00:03:00]  And it's like, I know I'm offending people right now, but it's horrible.  I know it's horrible.  I know that.  But then why do I have to be put in a position a few times a week where I have to like go  through this whole thing?  And then panic sets in.  Oh my God, please.  I have a conversation with myself.  Please don't stare at it.  Just don't stare at it.  Just look at his eyes.  Yeah.  You could do this.  And, and I, there's such relief that comes over me when he turns a little bit.  Cause then the other side of his face looks like he's, you know.  Oh, like two face.  Yeah.  Pretty much like two face.  You're right. 
[00:03:30]  Like two face.  You turn.  And although like, although it kind of, uh, bleeds over to the other side of his face  a little bit, but, but certain spots, but it looks like he just has like a little scab.  Like he's getting over a hit to the nose or something.  Does he look like Harvey Dent?  Anthony, instead of that, you know, that gruesomeness, just put a port wine stain on the right side  of Harvey Dent's face.  And that's exactly what I'm talking about.  Oh man.  Is this bad?  Am I supposed to be more open-minded? 
[00:04:00]  There's somebody out there right now listening to the show with one and he's going like,  oh man, God, I like these guys.  And, oh, look what they're doing to me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, but we do that with everybody.  I know.  We make fun of the blind.  I'm not saying it's a, you know.  We've got some blind people on the Twitter.  I'm not saying we should change anything.  I'm just saying that that's happening, you know.  Well, what, we're supposed to make believe it's okay and it, and the panic doesn't set  in and, because I don't want to be, I really try not to be an asshole in my regular fucking 
[00:04:30]  life.  Yeah.  So I have to play the game like everyone else does.  That's the beauty of the radio, the radio show.  We don't have to play the fucking game.  No.  We can say whatever the fuck we want.  Whatever we want.  We're assholes.  And then we get off the air and you're like, no, that's cool.  Yeah.  But if you walk through life like that, you know, you're going to have problems.  I remember listening years ago, and obviously this is not a physical thing or a bad thing  or anything, but I was listening to Howard when I was working, doing air conditioning  and heating, and some air conditioning and heating guy called up and started ragging on 
[00:05:00]  Howard, and Howard turned around and goes, what do you do for a living?  What do you do?  What do you do?  And he goes, I'm a tin knocker.  And he goes, tin knocker?  What's that?  And the guy said, I do air conditioning and heating.  And then Howard went on a five-minute tirade just ripping this guy apart for being an  air conditioning and heating guy.  And I was listening.  Right.  And I'm just like, oh, man.  Oh, man.  Well, you got that whole, you got them back.  Yeah.  You know that, too, right? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, that kind of came back.  I know we're more or less past a lot of that shit, but we, oh, boy, we won that one.  That was, trust me, we won that one over the years.  That was fun.  You took care of everyone that does air conditioning and heating.  I guess he is a bully.  Pat Cooper was right.  This guy says, my daughter has port wine stain all over her arm and body.  Well, yeah, but you could wear, like, a long-sleeve shirt. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Let's hear, what do you, uh...  Hey, Ryan, what's up, buddy?  Hey, good morning, you guys.  How you doing, man?  All right.  All right.  Yeah, my daughter, over her left arm, probably from her fingertips, all the way up to, like,  her armpit and across her chest, and then up the side of her neck is completely covered.  Jesus.  And she's six years old.  Oh.  And, of course, you know, kids and people, and, you know, we'll be in stores and shit.  We'll be staring.  And I understand people are different.  They don't understand it.  And, you know, you just take it one step at a time and try to help her out and keep comforting her 
[00:06:30]  and let her know it's just something a little different on the outside.  Well, thanks a lot.  Oh, man.  Now I feel like a complete asshole.  See what you did?  See?  I feel like a complete asshole now.  I don't feel like an asshole, guys.  It's just life, you know?  Everybody's different, and sometimes it's just on the outside, right?  Yeah, I understand all that, but I'm just...  Once there was this girl.  Who the fuck put that phone call through?  So, Ryan, thanks for your call, by the way.  Hey, you guys have a good day.  It's just too early for this shit where I have to feel bad now. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, man.  Who did it?  Who did it?  That was Handsome Rob.  Handsome Rob.  I thought he would know better.  You avoid those calls so he can get a few more jokes in.  He's infallible.  Don't worry about it.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  He's too handsome to make two dates.  He's too busy to make him believe he fucks hot chicks.  He insisted he wasn't lying yesterday.  I want proof somehow.  About Lloyd.  We want proof somehow, Rob.  But he did say he was lying about two fingers.  He said one finger.  Yeah, then he said one finger.  It starts to fall apart.  That's the worst lie ever when he said, yeah, I put two fingers in her ass. 
[00:07:30]  Really?  You did?  No.  He shoved two fingers up anyone's ass.  Especially if she's 20.  Yeah.  Then he said he went two knuckles deep, and then she said, oh, no, I don't want that.  Yeah.  How do you get two knuckles in?  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucking, that's no way.  No way.  Yeah, I don't know.  No way.  Something going on with that kid.  I'll put the challenge out to him, though.  He could prove it.  We told him to call her up.  And he said what?  I don't want to call her up. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, of course.  All right, well.  I'd be bragging, like, yeah, call her up.  Fucking tap that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Two knuckles in.  Look, I, I, this is not about beating up the people that have poor wine stains.  Because now they're saying Billy Corgan has one.  Where's his?  Like, on his arm or something?  Yeah, like on his hand.  Yeah, but I'm talking about right on the face.  Like, the entire side of his face.  Yeah.  I don't want to be uncomfortable. 
[00:08:30]  He inconvenienced you.  Do you understand this, Anna?  It might sound like a complete and utter dickhole to me.  I get it.  You're just, you know, you're just saying what happened.  Well, you walk in, you see him, and you're like, okay, here we go.  Here we go again.  I'm going to make believe I don't see it.  But do you think he knows you're making believe?  Or is he oblivious to everything because he's had it his entire life?  Yeah.  So to him, he don't give a fuck.  It's his life.  Maybe he's, you know, for those few seconds that he forgets about it, he's feeling all good. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  But, man, that can't last long.  It doesn't fuck him up.  There's water and fucking mirrors and windows.  Look through your eyes right now.  Yeah.  You don't know what your face looks like.  I'll look through my eyes.  Where else am I going to want to?  I mean, really focus on it.  Look around.  I don't know what my face looks like.  So to him, he's got that same feeling.  Oh, man.  He looks around like, I don't know what my face fucking looks like.  I'm good.  I wonder if he looks down, though, and sees, like, when you put dark under your eyes when  you're playing football, you could kind of see it.  You could kind of see your cheeks a little and the side of your nose and stuff. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  So he must see it when he looks a certain way.  What about growing up?  How many times did he have to hear, and what's your costume?  Oh, boy.  Look, ma'am, I just...  Some old lady, like, licking her thumb and going, on his cheek.  No, you'd have to get off.  Let me get that off.  You'd have some jam on you.  You'd have some preserve.  That guy...  You'd have to have a huge washcloth.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  I don't know.  That's terrible.  That fucking guy.  Poor bastard.  With his daughter, I feel bad.  Poor son of a bitch.  But, I mean...  Have they figured out anything for that?  Yeah, what the fuck can they do?  That's something that's just fucking...  What?  What?  Oh, God.  And it seems like there's varying degrees...  Oh, this guy has...  Of, like, fucking saturation and fucking varying degrees of, like...  Thickness of it.  Many treatments have been tried, including freezing, surgery, radiation, and tattooing. 
[00:10:30]  Holy mother of God.  So, I'm sure some of that stuff works a little bit.  Lasers.  Calms it down a little bit, right?  Lasers.  Lasers have made the biggest impact.  What causes that?  Lasers.  Freaking amazing.  Is it just a big...  Yeah, what is it?  Just some kind of anomaly?  What is it?  A big freckle.  Big Aaron Neville-y thing?  Do they even know how you get it?  It's genetics.  What?  All right.  Genetics, but...  That's vague.  But what is it?  An association with RASA1. 
[00:11:00]  R-A-S-A-1?  What does that mean?  Which is a protein activator, so there's not enough protein in the skin.  That's in Tide, right?  I don't know if that's...  Oh, that's bad.  Yeah, I don't...  Oof.  I guess a detergent joke, or...  Yeah, well, I love my detergent material, but not that one so much.  I've got to work on it.  We should keep it clean.  Ah!  Thank God.  So, that's just something I guess I want to bring up.  Jiminy Cricket. 
[00:11:30]  He's front and center.  Yeah.  And you see everyone else.  Everyone is just all in.  Like, all right, we all got to, like...  Yeah.  He's nice enough, and he's trying to help everybody, so let's all, like, just make believe we don't  see this.  Yeah, there was some guy working at CVS once.  I walked up to...  Well, I was online to go, and there were two registers, and one of the registers, some  guy had...  Like, he had a spell cast on him by an evil witch.  It was, like...  It was warts and, like, skin tags all over his face. 
[00:12:00]  All over it.  It was terrible.  Are we assholes?  We've got to be.  I don't like thinking that we might be assholes.  We went...  We did this show for years, not even thinking twice about saying this shit.  Well, I waited and let people go past me.  It was, like, an evil witch's spell.  An evil...  I let people go in front of me...  Right.  ...to, uh, whenever his register opened, until the other register opened, then I went. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Because, uh, I didn't want him touching my stuff.  Isn't that fucked?  Oh, yeah.  Like, that's not very inclusive or nice of me, but I didn't want it being contagious or  anything.  Good news.  It was down in Florida.  My buddy had one of these, uh, port wine stains, and it got it lasered off, so that's  good.  Oh.  So maybe, uh, some of that lasering does help.  Lasering.  All right, let's go through it.  Yeah.  We're older gentlemen now.  Sure.  Um, do you stare if a guy has a fake leg?  Not really.  I give it a look. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I'll give it like a...  But I won't stare like a child would.  Right.  And ask dumb questions like, hey, mister, you got...  Where's your leg?  Right.  Do you...  Dumb, dumb kids.  Do you stare at, uh, midgets still?  Uh, I'll give the side glance.  Like, like, I'm not looking to look like I'm staring, but you just can't look away from  those things.  I find it kind of...  You're hilarious.  I find it kind of cool.  Yeah.  It's fun.  And now with Game of Thrones, midgets are kind of in.  Yeah.  You know, you kind of look and go like, ah.  I love how they all kind of look alike.  It's kind of weird to me. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, what about, uh...  The one I still stare at a lot is the fake arm, because they don't have that down.  Oh, oh.  You mean the hook or the actual rubbery arm?  Uh, I've seen more hooks than rubberies.  Yeah, yeah.  What about, um...  What about, like, uh, tiny arms?  Tiny arms, wow.  That's hard not to look.  I try not to look.  I try not to look at tiny arms.  But that, I'm fascinated by.  Yeah, yeah.  Especially if they're holding an iPhone, but they're holding it where your bicep would be,  but that's where their hand is. 
[00:14:00]  It's like your fucking hand is coming out of your shoulder.  Oh, my God.  It's just weird.  It is very strange.  One thing I cannot look away from is an abnormally giant ass.  Like those ones, especially women that don't have big, fat upper section.  Black bruds.  And, yeah, a lot of black bruds have this.  Oh, out of proportion asses.  Out of proportion, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where it's that, and then it's this giant ass.  And you don't understand why that's bigger than the rest of the body?  Yes.  Like, what happened there? 
[00:14:30]  I, uh, will stare at a bad rug.  Bad rugs?  That's probably the number one on my list.  Oh, God, yeah.  I will stare at that shit.  You've got to look.  I will stare at an amazement.  And a comb-over.  A bad comb-over, too.  Comb-overs and bad rugs.  I'll stare at an amazement, because I can't believe someone would leave the house that  way.  How do you, how do you, like, reason with yourself that you'd rather look like that than just  have it shaved down?  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of other ones.  Oh, God.  I saw a comb-over guy in Colorado a long time ago when I was out there. 
[00:15:00]  He took the shit from the back of his head, right?  Well, actually, the side of his head.  Yeah.  He just swooped it around completely to the other side, where he literally must have  taken the hairs and combed it, like, around past his ear, and then cut it in the shape  of a sideburn.  Like, like, on the side.  I swear to God!  So how do you...  It was the dumbest thing.  How do you wear that?  I don't know.  With a lot of spray, I guess.  Yeah, Giuliani.  We're looking at old Giuliani pictures. 
[00:15:30]  Giuliani used to have the comb-over.  Yeah, the comb-over.  He's finally said, fuck it.  Oh, he said fuck it.  That was a good day for everybody.  We all went, yeah, right on, man.  We can handle that.  The comb-over of the 90s was the shaved head.  Yep.  That started becoming...  And it's still there.  It's still holding in there, hanging in there, the shaved head.  But some people are unfortunate.  They go bald and have a horrid, like, head to shave, because they look like cancer patients.  Yeah, I don't know.  Some people could pull it off.  I don't understand that.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, I'll look every time at a bad rug or comb-over.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, those are fun to look at.  I'm going to think of that freaking guy's daughter for the rest of the day.  Oh, that's...  Was that your intention?  That's terrible.  We were going to take a million phone calls out of port wine stains.  Damn it.  Well, you know, such is life, as they say, huh?  Sometimes I hate being a stupid father.  I think differently now.  Well, I got yelled at on Twitter, since you're bringing that up. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Some ass fuck.  Oh.  Oh, I mean, guy.  Here's what I wake up to.  I tweeted the video, if everybody's probably seen it at this point, of some daycare center  where this young black child, about nine years old, I guess.  He's nine.  Yeah, nine years old.  He started beating the shit out of the babies. 
[00:17:00]  They look like less than two.  Yeah, that were in this place, punching them, choking them, and then dropkicking them.  Why was he in there?  I have no idea what the details are.  Is he, like, supervising because maybe his mom runs the joint or something?  I don't think so.  Does anyone know?  I know that the woman...  I can't even watch this video, to be totally honest with you.  It bummed me the fuck out.  I can watch it.  It's kind of a weird thing.  You can watch this.  Yeah, yeah, because it just infuriates me.  How about this?  He looks around and then punches this little girl about four times. 
[00:17:30]  So he knows he's doing something wrong because he looked around.  He's choking this one.  He knows he's doing something wrong because he's looking around.  Look at that.  And he shakes the baby.  Shaking a baby.  Shake the baby.  Well, go back.  Is there adults in the background as he's doing that?  Yes.  Yes.  Fucking get ready.  No, no, no.  I'll tell you when.  Right there.  That adult woman, by the way, is the woman got arrested.  Oh, good.  And she should.  And pop the volume up on the aunt of this fucking animal child.  Listen to what she says. 
[00:18:00]  He shakes another child.  In an exclusive interview with a WLBT photojournalist,  the boy's aunt says the family is embarrassed by the attacks  and the daycare should be shut down.  He bad.  He fight kids, but he don't fight little babies.  He do also have a problem.  He take medicine every day.  And he just a normal child.  He a normal child.  He a normal child?  No.  Who is she?  The aunt. 
[00:18:30]  Of who?  Of the nine-year-old.  Of the nine-year-old.  Yeah, yeah.  So no one's going to explain to me why the nine-year-old is allowed to be in that?  No one's going to explain it.  Room?  Don't question it.  I have no idea.  What does the news say?  Put the rest of this.  I avoided most of this video, but now we're on.  Yeah.  The boy kicked one of the little girls while a daycare worker looks out the window.  This kick is classic right here.  And kicks her again.  Oh!  The nine-year-old can be seen waiting until workers turn away to attack the girls.  Vicksburg police arrested former daycare workers. 
[00:19:00]  Holy shit.  Trevelyan.  She's charged.  I didn't see the kick.  Oh, that kick is fucking amazing.  It's all bad, bud.  This nine-year-old child, he was allowed to pretty much run roughshod over that entire  room for a period of 15 or 20 minutes.  All his action went unnoticed.  The parent of one of the girls in Williams was.  Just put him down.  Since his daughter came home, he was.  Just put him down.  He's going to be a problem.  He only did it for 15 or 20 minutes, or was he there day after day? 
[00:19:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  A father got fucking arrested because he went to the fucking daycare center and smacked  some little kid in the face because he thought it was that kid.  Oh, really?  But it wasn't that kid, so they arrested him.  Ah, shit.  Whoopsie.  That sucks.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I can understand the anger, though.  A father would fear.  Oh, my God.  This kid's just not going to end up right or well.  He needs a lobotomy.  I completely agree with you, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hit play again.  ...a week with injuries, including a busted lip and a bite mark on her chin. 
[00:20:00]  Don't nobody know nothing today, kid.  Nobody know nothing.  Monday, he went in to ask why and hit a child he thought was responsible.  Whoops.  Police say it was the wrong kid, and he was later arrested and charged with simple assault,  a misdemeanor.  I understand why Jamie Williams would be upset.  However, even if he had attacked the 9-year-old, he still would have been arrested, and it  would have been just as wrong as him attacking the 9-year-old. 
[00:20:30]  That kick is unbelievable.  Police have interviewed the boy.  And a right in the right hook.  It's unclear if they'll face charges.  A choke.  Trevelyan was being held on a $2,600 bond Friday evening.  Williams' court date is set for later this month.  Joe Barnes, WLBT News.  Thank you.  Now we're going to have to deal with that kid as he grows up.  Thank you.  Yes.  I really appreciate that, society.  Thank you.  That kid is not going to be a nice contributing member of society.  That is going to be a burden, and it needs to be put down immediately.  I didn't see the kick, especially. 
[00:21:00]  I mean, the whole video is horrendous.  Well, I posted that video on Twitter, and it was making the rounds, and I just put LOL  and then posted the video.  Now, obviously, it was a sarcastic LOL.  It's like, there's really nothing to LOL about in there.  So putting LOL is an outrageous thing, you know?  And I would expect people that don't know me or the show to not get it, but then I get this. 
[00:21:30]  LOL, question mark, capital letters, LOL, question mark, fuck you, exclamation point.  I like you, but you are an asshole.  LOL, it is good you aren't a father, dickhead.  Block me.  And I just put piss off shithead.  Because, like, how do you not get that?  Huh? 
[00:22:00]  Huh?  Ugh.  Wow, it is Twitter.  Who is that?  B...  Oh, he's got a dumb name.  B-I-S-E-S-E.  The letter B, and then B-I-S-E-S-E.  Yeah, this guy's an idiot.  You just gave him some Midas followers today.  Whatever.  Let him fucking, let people call him a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  So, I mean, parents sometimes, I understand this whole fucking thing that happens. 
[00:22:30]  I know enough people that are parents.  I don't know the fucking, this weird fucking zombie thing that happens to people when they have kids.  But I do know that when they have kids, all of a sudden the kid becomes the prime directive in their life.  All right, I get it.  But you know what?  It doesn't mean I can't fucking make jokes or find something funny or even be sarcastic about something like that.  You used to.  I'm sure this guy used to laugh it up before his fucking wife's vagina opened up and spit that kid out. 
[00:23:00]  What do you want from me?  What do you want from me?  I agree with you, but that's enraging.  It is enraging.  That video is brutal.  It is enraging.  That shouldn't be happening.  I think that's a lot of parents' biggest fear, too.  Oh, yeah.  Like, I'm all in raising my kid, and A, because I want to, but B, I don't trust any of these assholes out there.  No.  I go to the park with my kid, and in New York City, all these parents have nannies. 
[00:23:30]  Yep.  And in New York, I'm just sitting, you know, because this is what I see, it's all black ladies, and they all don't give a fuck, and they're all on benches, and they're all on their phones, and then a kid will cry, and I've seen it a million times.  They'll all look up like, oh, fuck, is that my kid I'm watching?  Which one?  Which one?  Is it mine?  I just sit there and go, obviously, the parents went through some kind of interviewing process, and they felt like this lady, she obviously, and I see it, I see more bad nannies than good ones. 
[00:24:00]  That's why I'm bringing this up.  There are a couple good ones.  You do see them, because it's so obvious, because they're following the little kid around and stuff, but most of them sit on the fucking bench and hope their kid doesn't get hurt.  They have no vested interest.  And a playground is crazy, because it's all like, it's all kids running and have no idea how to stop or anything.  They're always crashing into something.  It's brutal.  Crashing into something.  Your heart rate goes up when you go to a playground.  Dude, it's brutal. 
[00:24:30]  They don't understand shit yet.  I know my heart rate goes up when I go to the playground.  And I sit there, like, you interviewed this lady to watch your kid.  How good was she, you know, during the interview?  Yeah.  That she now acts completely different when she's out and about, and you're at work or at your stupid tennis lessons.  Yeah.  Whatever the fuck you're doing, instead of raising your own kid a little bit.  You know?  And then you want to try to put them in maybe a program or something, and you're like, well, you can do your research. 
[00:25:00]  But in the end, you're like, all right, see you later, you know?  And you hope there's not a nine-year-old in there punching your little kid in the face.  Yeah.  Any shenanigans that happen at those places, just think of the ones that don't get discovered.  That's what I'm saying.  Terrible.  You don't know?  Yeah, you just don't know.  I would assume, you know, you do your research, you put your kid in a daycare or something, and you know, and they got good ratings or whatever online, but you never know. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Then you drive to work.  You don't know what the fuck's going on in there now?  It's horrifying.  You know, I'm lucky I don't work that many hours, and you know, I don't have to commute and all that.  So I do have a chance to raise my kid a little more than probably the average guy that has to make a living.  Yeah, working Joe.  That's got to, you know.  I realize I'm lucky, and I realize for their life in the city.  A lot of these parents have to fucking, you know, just hope for the best.  They do their research and just hope for the best, hope they pick the right daycare or the right nanny, if you could even afford a nanny. 
[00:26:00]  The old crapshoot.  Huh.  The old crapshoot.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  But, so, you tweeted that video, huh?  Yeah, yeah, I tweeted that one.  That's bad.  A few others, I gather.  So what happened to the nine-year-old?  Did you follow up on the story?  There's no, you know, because the kid's a kid, he's nine.  Right.  How much, you know, it's pretty much an issue for the family, and I'm sure that some kind of social worker is going to look in on the family and see why the kid's acting like this. 
[00:26:30]  Right.  But, you know, according to the aunt, he just bad.  He bad.  But, but he, he a normal chow.  Right.  He's not a normal chow.  Chow.  Not a normal chow.  He's an abnormal chow.  So, Robert in Plattsburgh says, I'm a father and found it kind of funny.  The video kind of funny?  That kid does disappear.  It's like a magic trick when he kicks that kid in the back.  Kid's there, kid's gone. 
[00:27:00]  Gone.  It's a magic act.  I do magic act.  I can still find kid shit funny, by the way, being a father.  I absolutely can.  Yeah.  I mean, if you, if you make fun of, we make fun of everything.  Yeah.  We make fun of things that affect us, personally.  I mean.  People don't understand that.  Yeah.  Because we don't announce that this next bit affects me very personally.  I just want you all to know that.  And then go into something horrid.  Yeah.  They don't realize that.  Yeah.  We got huge families, too. 
[00:27:30]  That we got, we got all sorts of weird shit.  They're all fucked up.  Right.  Believe me, there's, you know, there's shit going on.  I may even have a port wine stain in my lineage.  I don't know if I do.  I don't think so.  I don't, I think we're good on that one.  Yeah.  Who knows?  You never know.  One never know.  So, uh.  That storm was a bust last night.  How was it on Long Island?  Yeah, uh, there's been 20 times worse than that.  I mean, it was okay as far as the storm goes. 
[00:28:00]  Nothing.  It was very run of the mill.  I actually took a, um, I took one of my, um, GoPro cams and I just put it outside for  an hour for the entire duration of the storm and then condensed it down to a minute and  a half.  Right.  With the time lapse.  Looked really cool that way.  You know, the clouds are just billowing and looking real cool.  Well, let's take a look at it.  Uh, well, I couldn't upload it because I have no internet at my house.  What happened?  Well, look, I'm not going to say, uh, Verizon, uh, Fios is, is infallible. 
[00:28:30]  They're not perfect.  I've been waiting for this day.  And I told you that, you know, no company's perfect.  No company's perfect.  And eventually you're going to have problems with Fios.  I understand.  Nothing's perfect.  But, but.  What do they fuck up?  I, I have a service call in and, um, we'll see how that works out.  Well, I, I, I got home yesterday and I had internet.  Then I, I slept and I wake up and I did not have internets.  Um, and I looked downstairs at my router.  I have two routers, by the way, in my house. 
[00:29:00]  One just for TV and video.  And then the other one is just for the intranets.  Because, uh, when you have both, eh, that's not so good.  So, uh, I look and that amber light is on.  There's a little amber light over the little globe-y thing that means the internet.  And it's supposed to be green.  I'm like, ah.  So I go through all the fucking shenanigans.  You did everything that everyone wants to tell you?  I unplugged it.  I waited.  I plugged it back in.  Did you do a reboot?  Did you do a reboot?  Did you factory reset?  Did you, I, and I wound up pretty much cutting the entire power to my house. 
[00:29:30]  It was waiting and then flipping everything back on so all the, every bit of powered equipment  from Verizon, uh, was shut off, turned on, turned the battery backups off, everything.  Uh, it didn't work.  It stays amber.  I know that there's, I have, my network works, the router works, but there's no just internet  coming in through that cable that goes into the router.  Uh, so I got, I got to deal with that.  So I made my iPhone a hotspot and I was using the internet that way, but, uh, you know, 
[00:30:00]  you can't get that much data through there as far as uploading a great video like that.  So I want to see this video.  I know it looks really cool.  I want to, I want to use that for a few other things, but I can't figure out what it's just  really cool though.  Cause it doesn't budge.  I mean, the camera's fucking still right for an hour and then you condense it down.  I think it was 200%, uh, the speed was up and, um, it looks really cool, but, uh, yeah, 
[00:30:30]  I just, so I, I got no internet and then, uh, Verizon's, uh, service on Twitter, it's  like Verizon service or something.  Um, they were DMing me.  What do you mean?  Well, you know what happened?  Uh, what problem do you have?  And I was like, Oh, okay, here's the deal.  And they're like, all right, well, did you on, I'm like, look, I was like, look, let's  not even go through the first part of this flow chart thing that you have to go through.  Do you, do you at times when these people call you for a whole bunch of different companies? 
[00:31:00]  I always tell them, you see that script in front of you?  Yeah.  We're not doing that today.  Throw it away.  I always say that we're not doing that.  Okay.  You're going to, I say this, I give them instructions.  You're going to listen to me now.  I know you got that dumb fucking script in front of you or that dumb flow chart, but no, just  push that aside.  We're not doing this.  We're going to talk like human beings here.  Thank you.  Yes.  Without a flow chart or script to go by.  I do it all the time.  That script shit drives me nuts.  Yes.  So, uh, also I went online first and I downloaded a wonderful, uh, uh, program that, uh, Verizon 
[00:31:30]  has to, uh, diagnose your system, uh, for connectivity, connectivity issues.  So I downloaded, I started up and, uh, it tells me, please connect to the internet.  I swear, I was looking at it and I'm saying out loud, I'm going, you gotta be kidding  me.  Right.  How am I, that's my problem with connectivity.  And you're telling me to log on to the internet. 
[00:32:00]  That's funny.  Through my network.  That's very funny.  Well, that sucks.  So yeah.  We'll get the video up later.  Yeah.  I, and then I was going to, uh, just, um, thumb drive it, bring it here and do it.  But, uh, Anthony woke up, uh, five minutes later than usual.  So I didn't have that five minute buffer to, uh, run around the house doing things.  So we'll, uh, we'll just see your Twitter later.  Yeah.  Later on.  We'll check out your video.  I'll pop that motherfucker ups.  Yeah.  Although maybe not because I have Yankee socks to go to, uh, the scene in. 
[00:32:30]  I hear you're using our connection.  Oh, yeah.  She's listening right now.  Yes.  We got the best connection ever.  This is pretty much like knowing George Costanza when George was working for the Yankees.  Yep.  Uh, it's, it's wonderful.  Yep.  Fantastic.  And I'm going to go to, uh, see the, uh, I, I Yankees and socks tonight.  I went, uh, about a month ago.  Yeah.  It was.  Saw your seats.  It was amazing.  You tweeted the picture of your seats. 
[00:33:00]  I'm like, fuck man.  I'm on a, I want to check that shit out.  I think that's second row.  You'll probably have second row tonight.  Maybe first.  You never know.  You never know.  Hells.  Yeah.  She has, is an old school fan.  Goes way the fuck back.  And you get all those, uh, things too.  You get the wristbands so you could go in and get the food and stuff.  They have this little, uh, you go down, which is weird because you're pretty much field level.  Yep.  Then you pretty much go underground to this oasis that's just for that area.  It's a, it's like maybe. 
[00:33:30]  Fancy people.  It's maybe twice the studio.  And for the people, we have a very small studio and there's a bar there and then anything you want.  Yes.  And I told you before the show, you're going to get killed on the booze.  Yeah, it's all right.  I'm used to that.  I don't drink as much.  So I got out of there.  All right.  But everything else is free.  Hot candy free.  Peanuts free.  Fucking all sorts of hamburgers and hot dogs and steak and ice cream.  I have not been drinking as much as I usually do.  What?  I don't know. 
[00:34:00]  You got a fever?  I can't get, no.  I just can't really get into it.  Like, I used to love just pounding beers.  Is that bothering you?  No, I'm just wondering.  Like, why?  Like, I...  Maybe you're sick of it.  I'm like...  Maybe you're just sick of it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I love a good buzz, but...  I like putting a buzz on.  Yeah.  But with me...  I mean, it's so funny because you guys have no idea because it's been so many years.  But I was bad. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  I was bad from 18...  Probably right before we met, which is sad.  Because we would have really messed up for a while.  So, like, early 30s.  Yeah.  And with me, I just fucking hated wasting my weekends.  I hated it.  It finally got to me.  The no hangover thing is pretty good.  I love it.  I gotta be honest with you.  That's pretty goddamn good.  I still like putting it on a buzz.  I just don't like doing it all the time.  Yeah.  You might put it on a buzz tonight.  You never know. 
[00:35:00]  Whoa.  Like the...  Like drinking beers and stuff.  I would load up my fridge with two pitchers from the kegs downstairs when I'm outside.  I put two pitchers in there.  And then I barely even, like, dent it.  Dent one of them.  And then the rest just sit there and go flat.  Are you...  Oh, no.  Are you by yourself more these days?  Not all the time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So maybe that's what it is.  You need a little party around you. 
[00:35:30]  Maybe these bitches drove me to drink.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe that's another thing.  These fucking bitches drove me to fucking drink.  These bitches.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, but back to the storm.  So...  Yeah.  These assholes in our area.  Someone said we curse a lot.  Do we?  I have no...  I have no idea if we do.  I think...  Yes.  I think we might, yeah.  We do, huh?  Yeah.  Because it's just regular speech at this point?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's natural.  It doesn't sound forced.  So I'm going to try not to.  Right now.  Yeah, I'm going to try not to.  Starting fucking now. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  I'm going to try to, Sam.  Holy shit.  Oh.  Ah, sorry, guys.  Oh, hold on.  That was a fun bit.  Put a quarter in the cookie jar.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  So glad you've learned a lot from us.  That was hilarious.  Thank you.  Hey.  Now I can't repeat what Kevin from Connecticut just called me because I'd be cursing.  You could use my initials.  He said, Anthony, you're an A-H.  For what reason?  He said that?  Yes.  Because you don't drink as much.  I don't know.  I think he's trying to get me to curse. 
[00:36:30]  Oh.  Anyway, the weather guys really have to...  See, I wanted a curse right there.  Oh, boy.  This could be a problem.  Is it a crutch?  Has it been a crutch for us?  It might be a crutch.  It might be a crutch.  A filler, you know?  Wow.  They're jerks.  They're just jerks.  The show's going to be a little slower today because now I want to do this.  All right.  Let's go.  Okay.  So the local weather guys are jerks because they had us all believing.  And could someone come up with what they said? 
[00:37:00]  Because I'd never heard of this storm before.  But basically, it was a whole bunch of thunderstorms connecting.  Yeah.  Into a V.  Converging.  Converging.  Like the perfect storm.  And the point of the V was heading toward New York.  And they said hail up to the size of...  I think they went higher than golf balls this time around.  What?  And they said...  Soft ball size hail?  I don't want to quote them, but I think they said bigger than golf balls. 
[00:37:30]  And they said that winds up to 60 miles an hour.  Basically saying you should not go outside.  Yeah.  From 7 o'clock on.  That's what I heard.  What's the term called?  I think it started with a D.  I've never heard of this before, where a whole bunch of thunderstorms converge, forming this  like super storm.  But there's a name for it.  It was very short-lived.  And they said it would be short.  Yeah.  They said it would be an hour.  It moved through really fast, and it was a thin line. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  But a lot of lightning.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  And 60 mile an hour winds, which would knock out trees and windows, and it would blow you  across the fucking yard, all that shit.  Oh, uh-oh.  What happened?  You just said the F and the S word.  You did.  You cursed.  What?  When?  Just then.  Yeah, you said...  When?  There was two in there.  There were two in there.  Oh, my God.  And all that...  Wait, really?  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm trying.  I'm trying, too.  What did I say?  You could use the initials.  You said, and all that F and S. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, God.  Really?  Yeah.  I swear to you.  I know.  That's why I'm totally conscious of it right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Iraq has it.  Oh, okay.  Trees and windows, and it would blow you across the fucking yard, all that shit.  Oh, God.  Are you kidding?  I lasted two minutes.  You lasted two minutes.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:39:00]  And it's not a bit where, all right, now sneak the curses in.  No.  I swear to God, I thought I was doing well.  That was all legit.  Man.  Anyway, this storm was a complete bust.  Yeah, yeah.  Not a biggie.  We've had way worse this summer alone.  I think north of Manhattan, they had a little bit more.  Elmira.  Some parts of...  Yeah, Pennsylvania got a lot.  My western New Yorkers got hit with some...  Wow, I almost said it there.  Some stuff.  Yeah.  They got hit with some stuff. 
[00:39:30]  Tornado touched down in Elmira.  I know Elmira.  Elmira.  Elmira.  Yeah.  All right, maybe not.  But you had nothing on Long Island?  No, about an hour.  About an hour of some moderate rain.  Not even that bad.  Yeah.  A lot of lightning, which was cool.  Yeah.  Not much of that loud thunder, though.  It wasn't close.  Like, sometimes you get a lot of lightning strikes, but you don't get that...  That's cool.  Oh, where it crackles first and then just explodes.  I love it. 
[00:40:00]  It is pretty cool.  Thank you.  This guy is right, and he gets to come on our show today.  Eli in Jersey.  Go ahead, Eli.  Yeah, I just had that in my town in South Jersey like a month ago.  It's like a crazy-ass storm.  I was looking out my window.  My whole city got wrecked.  All the streets were all down.  Across the town, we're like $200 million.  What is the name of the storm?  Derico.  What?  It's like straight, but in Spanish.  You know Jericho? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Just think Derico.  Derico.  It's spelled...  It's Jericho with a D instead of a J.  So however you would pronounce that.  Yeah, but he's right.  That's exactly what it is.  So look that up and tell us what that means.  Because maybe...  It went from...  It was a storm that went...  It went straight through the town.  It was just a high-velocity of wind.  It was just straight rain and thundering.  Like I was looking out my window.  I see like 20...  It looked like the light bulb in the sky.  It was straight lightning. 
[00:41:00]  I guess what...  All right.  Eli, thank you, bro.  You know what happens?  Because I want to show some knowledge today.  So you get the hail.  Yeah.  Hail is cold.  Yeah.  And it's falling through the atmosphere.  Yep.  And it cools everything down.  Yeah.  And that makes everything get crazier.  Crazy.  Anytime you got that heat and then that cold together, oh, nature don't like that.  What's a Dereco?  Oh, they spell D-E-R-E-C-O.  Ah.  Okay.  Derecho means straight in Spanish.  Derecho. 
[00:41:30]  Derecho.  It's a widespread, long-lived, straight-line windstorm that's associated with a fast-moving  band of severe thunderstorms.  That's what it was.  I saw, yeah.  It was a real thin line.  Yeah.  That's exactly what you're talking about.  Yeah.  Punch up that weather channel map.  I don't know where it really hit.  But it didn't hit, really, in Manhattan or Long Island.  You know, regular storms.  Mm-hmm.  So.  Yeah.  It was all right, but not.  Do you get excited when they start announcing this stuff?  I love it.  I think everybody does. 
[00:42:00]  It's kind of an adventure.  It's a little element of danger.  And it makes news.  Things happen.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  So, yeah.  I think people get a little excited.  I'm all in when it comes to hurricanes, blizzards.  Yeah.  All that stuff.  A good blizzard, I like.  Lightning just crash around you.  Lightning crash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Blizzards are pretty good.  I love all that stuff.  And I love when it shuts things down.  See, that's where we're different.  You need your electricity.  I don't mind going. 
[00:42:30]  Chad.  I don't mind going dark.  Chad.  Somebody says, what's the barometric pressure?  Well, if you'd let me talk.  Karen.  Karen.  Karen.  Was it Karen?  We needed that information.  Did you see Prince?  Was it William?  Harry, which is the one that's really going bald.  Prince William?  That's William, yeah.  With that hot wife of his, Kate and Middleton. 
[00:43:00]  Right?  Yeah.  I love that we don't need to know this shit over here.  No.  I'm back to cursing.  Yeah.  And I can't do it.  I as well.  I can't do it.  I can't do it, Sam.  Screw it.  There's something to be said, being able to pepper your language with curses.  Yeah.  You see him try to kick a soccer ball?  Oh, is he like his dad?  This guy.  Just a spaz?  This guy never had to do anything with his life.  No.  You would think if you never had to work, never really had to go to school, and people go, 
[00:43:30]  he went to school.  He had all sorts of tutors and everyone doing everything for him.  Of course.  You would think you'd have a lot more time to maybe play sports and be able to kick a soccer  ball.  Nah, they're all soft.  Especially if you're from England.  They kind of like their soccer a little more over there.  Yeah.  Look at him.  He's just a big dork.  Oh, he just looks terrible.  Oh, man.  Get the video of him trying.  He's his dad.  He's all lanky and stuff.  There's a video of him.  He goes through kind of a quick obstacle, soccer obstacle course they do. 
[00:44:00]  You know, a back, forth, back, forth, back, forth.  Yeah.  And then they kind of kick the ball at you, and then you're supposed to kick in the goal.  Uh-huh.  Wide left.  Wide left.  Didn't make it.  Oh, no.  But, I mean, you could tell he has absolutely no skills whatsoever.  No athletic prowess.  Yeah.  Prince William.  Nah.  Nah.  They got them Olympics over there, huh?  Tonight.  Tonight, the big opening ceremonies.  Mm-hmm.  I guess Sir Paul is going to be playing. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, really?  Is that what I heard?  Yeah.  They've got a bunch of English celebrities.  They've got a big, kind of a campy opening number.  Okay.  They're going to do involving, like, kind of a James Bond thing.  All right.  It's going to be very, ooh, production.  A lot of pop artists?  A lot of, yes, probably.  A lot of dry English humor that no one else in the world will get.  They'll try to interject that in there.  Uh-huh. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  The Spice Girls, you think they'll make an appearance?  Oh, here it is.  Here's the video.  Okay.  Here he goes.  Oh, a commercial.  Oh, Sam.  I know.  Why'd you do this, Sam?  I don't know.  Just to make a little cash.  Where's the skip ad feature?  Make a little cash.  There you go.  A lot of sites are blowing off the skip ad feature.  I know, because they want to get the ad money.  All right.  So he has to go through the opposite of course, right?  Like a big dork. 
[00:45:30]  Here's the ball, and...  He stinks with an open net.  He's 15.  It's an open net 15 feet away.  Oh, man.  Pretty bad.  Why do they take him seriously?  Why would you ever give this guy respect?  I'm sure he's a nice guy.  I guess I'd be nice to him.  Yeah.  Who is he?  He's stink.  He kicked that one over the 20-foot fence behind the goal.  He is fucking... 
[00:46:00]  He's losing his hair like he's eating uranium fondue.  I know.  I've never seen someone lose their hair that quickly.  I don't know why.  Wow.  He probably panics when he sees that nice pussy.  You think?  Yeah, he's pretty hot.  I bet you he just doesn't know what he's doing.  And then Harry, his brother, has got a giant head of curly locks.  Nope.  It has begun on him, too.  No way, really?  Let me see.  It's funny you bring that up today, because they had a video.  I guess because of the Olympics.  They're showing these two kids a lot. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no.  And they showed a video the other day of him leaving a club or somewhere.  I don't know where the hell he was going.  And it has begun on him, too.  Oh, man.  Oh, he's a couple years...  I thought Harry was the lucky one.  He's a couple years behind, but he...  Yeah, I don't know what video it was.  I have no idea how to get you there, but you could tell.  Damn!  Yeah, you could tell it's kind of...  You couldn't, um...  It's the start of it looking sort of cotton candy-ish. 
[00:47:00]  Cotton candy-ish.  Well, this is...  That's the wedding.  Yeah, that's...  He still had a full head of hair at the wedding, Harry.  What, uh...  It's been a rough year for the boys and their hairline.  How could you not find that?  Isn't there a Harry going bald kind of prince, Harry?  I think it was more me just going, uh-oh, okay.  How about images, dude?  What's the matter with you?  I was looking for the video.  If you're looking for pictures...  See, guess what happens is you get all the prints.  Well, that's okay, and then you look for the other ones. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, these are older pictures of Harry when he has what Anne's talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  He's nowhere near his brother, don't get me wrong, but you can see it has begun.  That's all I'm saying here.  Oh, man.  I'm not going to oversell this.  Oh, I haven't seen it yet.  Well, you'll see him in the coming days, so, you know, judge for yourself.  Don't take my word for it.  Hey, Aaron Lewis is performing outside this building right now.  Is it the Aaron Lewis we know?  At the All-American Summer Concerts at Fox?  But I heard them, um... 
[00:48:00]  I heard them, like, doing a sound check.  We get to hear the sound check as we're pulling in.  Yeah.  I always, you know, roll down the window, and I think that drives Kenny nuts,  because I usually don't roll down the window, and anything different with Kenny,  I think, kind of gets them going.  Yeah.  And I heard country music.  Aaron Lewis isn't doing country, right?  I'm talking about the Stained guy.  From Stained?  He is doing country?  Is it the same guy?  Maybe it's not the same guy.  I mean, his album's Country Boy. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, but it might be another Aaron Lewis.  No, it's Aaron Lewis from Stained.  It's Aaron Lewis from Stained.  Is it country, or is it just called Country Boy?  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  I swear to you what I heard.  Now I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you were...  Oh, pause this.  Sounds like Stained.  Pause this.  Holy shit.  We might have to play this.  What is that?  Is that his first single?  That's Country Boy.  Can we play this today?  Because I love Aaron Lewis.  I was a huge Stained fan for a while.  Once you go down there and marry him.  He should come up here and play that song acoustically. 
[00:49:00]  Why?  Fox News would put him on for 30 seconds.  Use him as a bumper.  But he knows who we are.  Did we ever have him on the show?  I think we might have been on the phone.  Back in the day?  Yeah, and supposedly the band way back when we were at AAF were fans of the show and all  that.  Yeah.  Way, way back.  Wow, Aaron Lewis from Stained is doing country.  Do you mind if we play this today yet?  No, not at all.  It sounded pretty cool.  Yeah, we'll play it to break. 
[00:49:30]  What is it?  It's called Country Boy.  And he's doing country.  God, I lost touch with this guy.  Is it country, though?  What I heard this morning, I'm like, that's a country word.  Oh, was it?  There was no doubt in my mind.  So then when I came up here and told you, I'm like, is there another Aaron Lewis that  does country?  But now I'm finding out it's the same guy.  And the song is featuring George Jones and Charlie Daniels.  Well, Ann likes Charlie Daniels.  I know that.  Well, I used to.  You don't like him anymore?  What happened?  When I was in fucking school, you know?  You know, everybody listened to Charlie Daniels back then. 
[00:50:00]  You were into Southern Rock?  Outlaws, Molly Hatchet.  What do they call it?  Southern Fried Rock?  Southern Rock.  I was listening.  I think I did a Southern Fried Rock weekend once.  I did it all, folks.  Molly Hatchet came on the other day, and I was just like, oh, my God.  People just loved the double leads.  Two guitarists doing the harmonic leads.  You don't hear that anymore. 
[00:50:30]  But I still like that.  Yeah.  I'll turn that up every time.  How was that popular?  And whistling in a song.  They always had to do that.  Were you into 38 Special?  38 Special?  Oh, yeah.  38 Special.  Fucking.  Rossington Collins.  Yeah.  Rossington Collins.  You got to go Skinner, obviously.  Skinner.  Play some Skinner, man. 
[00:51:00]  What are some of those Southern Fried Rock fans?  Southern Fried Rock.  I go Skinner, Molly Hatchet.  You got to go 38 Special.  You got to go Outlaws.  You got to go Outlaws.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's an actual album called Southern Fried Rock.  Of course there is.  Oh, man.  Who's on the Southern Fried Rock album?  Oh, Train Train.  Train Train.  I love that song.  I love that song.  Ozark Mountain Daredevils. 
[00:51:30]  Right on.  What was that one song?  God.  What song did the Ozark Mountain?  They did, uh...  Come on, Kevin.  Where are you today, buddy?  Allman Brothers.  Make the list.  Uh...  Uh...  Black Oak, Arkansas.  Jim Dandy.  Pure Prairie League.  They were a little wimpy.  Yeah, they were pretty wimpy.  I did like Amy, though.  That was a cool little song, I guess.  I don't know the rest of these, really.  Outlaws are on there.  Marshall Tucker Band.  There you go.  Marshall Tucker.  I don't know Wet Willie, and I don't know Elvin Bishop. 
[00:52:00]  Elvin Bishop was just a...  Yeah, I don't know if that fits into Southern Fried.  Wasn't he more just like...  Yeah, I think it was kind of weird.  Adult Contemporary?  Yeah.  The Bellamy Brothers?  Who?  What did Ozark Mountain Daredevils...  Is it If You Want to Get to Heaven?  That's a cool song, but there's one that's really...  There's a bunch of songs.  There's one that's just down and dirty, man.  Black Sky, Chicken Train.  Chicken Train.  Give me a little Chicken Train.  Chicken Train?  You'll know this one. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  This is just very...  Oh, man.  They're on a porch somewhere just playing whatever the fuck they can find in the backyard.  Yeah, it turns up.  I like Chicken Train.  Tune in, son of a bitch.  Oh, man.  This is weird stuff.  Any of that...  You know the problems.  Oh, yeah.  You know there's a Confederate flag nearby. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  You just know that.  The house next door to me was sold.  What?  I hate this.  You don't like it?  I fucking hate this.  What about musical?  It's terrible.  Hey, I can't get old.  I can't get old.  All right.  We can't play the rest of the day.  This is some fucking...  I'm sorry.  We can't play the rest of the day.  I'm sorry.  We can't play the rest of the day.  Hillbilly shit.  You don't like that hillbilly groove?  No. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, it's terrible.  You don't like that?  God.  That Hatfield and McCoy music.  Of course it is.  Yes.  Man.  No.  Terrible.  Not feeling that one?  Not at all.  What other songs have they got?  There might be another one I could turn Anthony on to.  I haven't thought about this band in a long time.  Country Girl, Fly Away Home, Homemade Wine, I'm Still Dreaming, If You Want to Get to Heaven,  In the Day and the Night, Jackie Blue, New York, Road to Glory, Standing on the Rock,  and You Made It Right. 
[00:54:00]  If You Want to Get to Heaven is a really good song, actually.  You would like that one.  Is it?  You know that one.  Do I know it?  Let me hear it.  Let me hear that one.  And Jackie Blue I want to hear.  For some reason that sounds...  He needed the money.  Or she.  This song, you know this one.  Do you like that groove?  I'm not digging any of this.  I like a good harmonica.  Very easy to play.  Wow, this is terrible. 
[00:54:30]  You can accent your music with it pretty well.  It's repetitive.  I don't know this.  You know this.  No, I don't think so.  When it kicks in, you'll know.  I read it in a book.  I never saw it on a show.  But I heard it in the alley on a wheel.  I don't know this.  Really?  I swear to you.  Wow.  I don't know it.  I don't know this. 
[00:55:00]  This was definitely on the radio.  What's their hit?  What was their big hit?  I would have to go with this.  Wow, that's terrible.  Jackie Blue.  I played Jackie Blue then.  You know Jackie Blue.  I don't know.  It's very different than...  You know this.  This was on AM radio.  Jackie Blue.  Oh, yeah.  I know this one.  Believe it or not, it's the same band.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Jackie Blue.  Isn't that amazing?  It's the same band?  I just thought it was Jackie Poop.  Jackie Poop. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, I remember this.  I remember this.  I remember this.  Yeah.  This is a little more...  Yeah, a little more crossover-ish from that...  Oh, absolutely.  Shit-kicking, fucking...  No-tooth, harmonica-y shit.  I think it made that...  Those goof records? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Help me out.  Oh, yeah.  The Jaws.  That guy.  That guy.  We did a whole bit on him.  Yeah.  Where he would take clips from songs.  Dickie Goodman.  Thank you.  Dickie Goodman.  Yes.  I think it's made a Dickie Goodman song.  Dickie Goodman.  And what was her name?  Jackie Blue.  So stupid.  I kind of liked it, though, when I was growing up.  Dickie Goodman.  All right, let's play the Stained song.  Well, it's not Stained.  It's Aaron Lewis, who's now a country artist. 
[00:56:30]  I had no idea, man.  Who's in touch?  This is his single?  Country Boy.  It's called Country Boy?  All right, we'll go to break with this.  Joe DeRose is joining us today, and also Otto and George a little later.  We're on.  I'm ready.  Now I grew up down an old dirt road in a town you wouldn't know.  My pops picked the place up for $1,500 back in 1964. 
[00:57:00]  My grandfather was a drinker back in the day he'd put them down.  But a war is known to change a man.  And the whiskey's known to change a man.  That's not me.  I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed. 
[00:57:30]  I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go.  In a town of 1,200 off an old dirt road in a country, boy, is all I'll ever be.  Now it's been 12 years since I sold my soul to the devil in L.A.  He said, sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs, they all will play. 
[00:58:00]  He said, you want to sell a million records, boy, you better listen to me.  He said, change your style, whiten your smile, you could lose a couple of pounds.  If you want to live this life, you better lose that wife. 
[00:58:30]  Do you need your friends around?  I said, no, that's not me.  Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family.  And I like my jeans and my old T-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt.  Cause the country boy is all I'll ever be. 
[00:59:00]  Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive.  He'll never catch me out the house without my nine or forty-five.  I got a big old tracker and a diesel truck.  And my dear heaven's chasing white tailpucks.  And as a country boy, you know I can survive. 
[00:59:30]  Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel.  One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue.  The other one's got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made. 
[01:00:00]  Don't tread on me, is what it says.  And I'll take that to my ground.  This is me.  And I've said it before, but I'll say it again. 
[01:00:30]  Cause I've never needed government to hold my hand.  And I've said it before, but I'll say it again.  Cause my family's always fought and died to save this land.  And a country boy is all I'll ever be.  I love my country. 
[01:01:00]  I love my guns.  I love my family.  I love the way it is now.  And anybody that tries to change it has to come through me.  That should be all of our attitude.  It's this is America.  And a country boy is good enough for me, son.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Anthony Show. 
[01:01:30]  Want to welcome Joe DeRozan to the show.  He's playing the Stress Factory this weekend.  Yes, thank you, sir.  Joe's one of our faves when Jim Norton's not here.  Even when he is.  That's good.  We hate him when Jim's here.  Oh, you know what I'm saying.  I got it.  You're on our short list of people to come in when Jimmy's doing his thing. 
[01:02:00]  Well, I thank you guys for having me in here.  And it's very nice to see you both.  I was really trying to be nice.  Be sincere.  It sounded like I was being an asshole.  Isn't it weird to try to be nice?  It is.  There's no place for that here.  You got to tell the story, though, because I am getting killed over the Aaron Lewis thing.  I do like him.  But Kevin from Connecticut, Kevin from Con with two N's on Twitter, a country boy from Springfield, Massachusetts.  Oh, boy.  We played Aaron Lewis' latest. 
[01:02:30]  He was the lead singer in Stained.  I don't know if he's still doing Stained, but he's doing a country thing.  And I liked it.  We played his first single called The Country Boy.  And this guy, K-9 Craig, writes,  It's a decent song, but sorry, Ope.  Aaron Lewis is a complete sellout.  He couldn't have fit more cliches in that one.  Yuck.  And then all the people saying it sounds like it is Nickelback, by the way.  Nickelback, rock star.  Ah, yeah.  And a little bit of Kid Rock, too.  There's a Kid Rock song.  Ah, the Kid Rock song.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  I'm a Cowboy?  No, no, no.  When he went country, for real.  Yeah.  The one he did with Sheryl Crow.  No, I think it was the one he did with the picture song.  That makes me sick.  Was it Sweet Home Alabama fucking sample?  And The Summer and all that.  Yeah, yeah.  What song was that again?  All Summer Long.  All Summer Long.  Give me a little taste of All Summer Long.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  This is Where Will's the London, too. 
[01:03:30]  He owes a lot of people money, man.  You can't get away with this shit.  Where's the originality?  Alabama.  Sweet Home Alabama and Where Will's the London, like, the same.  Right.  Both those songs stink.  Oh, yeah.  It was 1989.  My bones were short.  My hair was long.  Nothing.  Hey, he's just reflecting.  He's just reflecting on his youth, man.  Yeah, this song's very visual.  Was he Brian Adams?  Fucking, you know.  You don't like this.  Just remember in the days of hanging with chicks and your friends. 
[01:04:00]  All Summer Long, man.  All Summer Long.  I'll tell you, guys, it was just simpler back then.  You know what I mean?  Simpler times, man.  I hear you.  I hear you.  I know.  No mortgage.  No car.  You got a bandana in your jean pocket.  It was a great time, man.  If I had enough for a six-pack, that's all that mattered, man.  These are great days we're living in, bros.  Let me tell you.  No, you don't like this.  This sucks.  And your boy Aaron Lewis sucks.  Wait.  Here's the hook, though. 
[01:04:30]  Come on.  Ah, road sodas.  Just driving around with some road sodas.  Right.  There it is.  Yes.  I'm singing a thing, Melody, as the verse in the chorus, but we just had a black girl  behind it.  Sing it all Summer Long.  So why wouldn't you just put on Sweet Home Alabama?  There it is.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  Singing Sweet Home Alabama all Summer Long. 
[01:05:00]  I love when he gets emotional.  This song just reminds me of the summer of Anthelini, too.  Oh, really?  This just played all that whole fucking summer.  What's Anthelini?  Oh, the Anthelini.  That was like Brangelina.  Can we hear that?  Right.  And a fucking Tomcat?  Yeah.  This was Anthelini.  This is when I was going out with Jill Nicolini.  They dubbed that Anthelini.  Was this your song? 
[01:05:30]  No, it wasn't our song.  You guys had this as your song?  No, this just played, like, constantly.  That was supposed to be goofy.  You sure?  You both have a cowboy wear on.  There are more fucking pictures of us on the internet than anything else.  Oh, my God.  I look like a Halloween, Burt Reynolds fucking Halloween costume.  Do you miss her?  No.  What? 
[01:06:00]  No, I don't.  She was cool?  She was cool.  She is so hot.  I know.  She is so hot.  I do fucking score pretty well for, you know, me.  For me?  What does that mean?  Well, you'd think.  The normal person would think, ah.  You know.  She's definitely hot.  Yeah, she was fucking pretty.  Is she single?  I think so.  Why don't you set me up with her?  All right.  I don't know.  That was easy, you know?  I don't know. 
[01:06:30]  If you value your stuff, I wouldn't do that.  Fuck it, dude.  I don't got shit.  All right.  So you don't care if she burns half your shit when the relationship goes bad?  Oh, that was when we had our baby.  Whose baby is that?  Oh, we didn't tell you?  That was her niece.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was from your side of the family.  That's who Ant was cheating on her with.  Very funny.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  So Aaron Lewis is outside this building right now.  Was that too much?  No. 
[01:07:00]  I'm kidding.  Fuck it.  Just go with it.  Oh, I don't know.  Aaron Lewis is on Fox & Friends.  I'm fair game.  Yeah.  And we were playing Country Boy, and you were yelling and screaming down the hall.  So let's bring it to the show.  What happened?  I was in the room down there.  Our office, I guess?  Travis' office.  Yes.  That used to be our office.  We haven't seen it in how long now?  Over a year, easily?  I don't even care what goes on in that room.  Three years.  Yeah.  We haven't seen our office in three years.  We refuse to go down there.  I don't blame you.  I hear it's nice.  Have you seen it down there?  I hear it's all nice. 
[01:07:30]  There's pictures all over the place.  CDs everywhere and all kinds of memorabilia.  I hear it's great.  Yeah.  But that side of the fucking floor, no thank you.  Because of things with the guys.  You see that railing?  That's when it gets bad.  And unfortunately, our office is past the railing.  Just past.  If the office was on this side of the railing, then I would go there more.  It's like crossing over the neutral zone.  As soon as you hang out down there, there's always some douche in a fucking tie that has  to come in and make believe he's got a job that means something. 
[01:08:00]  There is a sort of...  Sorry.  It's true.  It's true, though.  These guys don't know how to do radio.  Shut up.  There is sort of a...  What's it called?  Field...  Oh, fuck it.  I can't even get the reference out.  I'm sorry, man.  I woke up at like 4.30.  You feel it when you're in that office, is what you're saying?  There's like a...  There's a little bit of a vibe of like one of those... 
[01:08:30]  I don't know.  I feel like I'm in the mansion in Citizen Kane when I'm down there.  There's just a lot of memorabilia from things and events.  You know what it is?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Unfortunately, our office is in the area where like two rivers meet.  Uh-huh.  You ever seen that when you're boating or like snorkeling?  Yeah.  And two rivers meet and it's just turmoil.  A little turmoil down there.  There's one river and it wants to go this way.  And this river wants to go this way.  And unfortunately, our office is right in the middle.  And it's just spinning out of control in that area.  You can't let it get to you, man. 
[01:09:00]  No.  Well, we don't go...  We don't...  No, I don't go down there.  No, man.  We take the left.  You take the left.  You put on all summer long.  That's right.  And you take it easy with your day.  All summer long.  So I hear that I was talking about Stained and Aaron Lewis and you were giving me a good  beating down the hall.  I wasn't giving you a good beating.  This is what happened.  That's okay.  I asked Travis, who was playing at...  Who was playing at...  What's it called?  Fox.  At Fox today.  I go, there's a stage over there.  Who's playing?  And Travis goes, Aaron... 
[01:09:30]  What's his name?  Aaron Lewis.  I use Aaron Lewis.  I go, who's Aaron Lewis?  And he goes, he's the lead singer from Stained.  And I go, oh, they stink.  They're the fucking worst.  And as I was saying it, the radio feed was coming over the speaker and I heard you go,  big Stained fan for Bethany.  I love those guys, man.  They're the best.  I haven't kept up on them, but I did like them.  And I like when he goes acoustic.  Here's why I hate them.  Yes.  That song, It's Been a While. 
[01:10:00]  You don't like It's Been a While?  No, it fucking blows.  How do you like that song?  Give me It's Been a While.  You remember this.  We played it a lot.  Yeah, probably.  We probably played this song a thousand times.  This song sucks.  You rock now?  No.  You don't like this song?  Why?  What's wrong with this?  I gotta tell you why.  You know, I don't want to talk over it.  All right.  It's been a while since I could. 
[01:10:30]  Write a good song.  You hold my head up high.  It's been a while since I first saw you.  It's that whole 90s thing.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  With every label in the 90s going, like, in their meetings, we need more Walter Matthau sounding singers. 
[01:11:00]  Remember the way he would sing in The Odd Couple?  We need more guys.  How do you not like this?  Because it sucks.  You're getting my voice to go high today.  How do you not like this?  You like this, Ed?  You don't have to just agree with Joe because it's your drinking part.  Oh, please.  I want an honest answer here, sir.  I definitely wouldn't.  No, I don't mind this at all.  Yeah?  This isn't...  I'm not looking for it.  I'm not searching it out. 
[01:11:30]  But if it comes on, I'm not like, ah!  Which I do with some songs.  I go, ah!  And I just punch right out of them.  This comes on lithium.  What do you do?  I leave it.  All right.  There you go.  Unacceptable.  Unacceptable.  Wow.  Wow.  Unacceptable.  This song...  It can't be that bad.  All right.  Now...  I can understand you don't like something.  Yeah, it's not.  It's unacceptable.  It's completely generic.  Yeah.  Now, let me tell you what began my hatred for this song. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  This song...  Okay.  This is this.  I love this.  Really?  We're going to hear the whole fucking story?  I love it.  Really?  What started my hating this song was, this song came out the same week that the new...  When Tool put out Lateralis, and the single was...  Which I love, too, by the way.  That song is amazing.  Which one?  Is that the Spiral one?  I know the pieces.  That song, yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That song ruled.  Now we've got to play a piece of that in a little bit.  So, these songs came out the same week, and it was back when rock radio was still kind  of a thing that actually existed on terrestrial radio.  And I was driving around...  I'm going to challenge you, by the way.  What?  I don't think those two songs came out at the same time.  They did.  Here's why.  This is how I know.  Are you sure?  Positive.  I think this song had such a long shelf life.  Well, I'm going to challenge you on that.  I think you're off by a year.  But he's going to tell the story as to why he knows this. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, fair enough.  Go ahead.  This is what happened.  I was delivering pizzas at the time, in the summertime.  It was just one of those summers, man.  All summer long, man.  Delivering pizzas, man.  Smoking weed and delivering pizzas.  I'm not making a lot of money, but I'm happy.  Yeah, so that was my summer job.  I was driving around, and all fucking morning, they kept going, we're going to play a new  Tool song today.  We're going to play a new Tool song.  I was like, fuck, I want to hear a new Tool song.  And I got in my car, and this song came on. 
[01:13:30]  And that guy sounds enough like the guy from Tool that I thought this was the new Tool song.  Oh.  And I was like, what the fuck?  You were bummed.  Yeah, I was like, what is Tool doing?  And I got so upset.  And then I was like, and then they go, that's the new one from Stained.  It's been a while.  And I was like, fuck you, Stained.  That song stinks.  Holy fuck.  You're right, though.  This does sound a bit like Maynard.  It could.  If Maynard was chilling out a little bit. 
[01:14:00]  It does.  A little bit.  It does.  This is what he'll be singing when he comes back from his winery.  He's not the music again.  I love Tool.  Fuck.  I love everything he's done.  Look, he's great.  Because when I first saw the video and heard Sober, it was just like, you gotta be kidding  me.  This is fucking fantastic.  You ever seen Tool in concert?  That was like a while ago.  You ever seen him in concert?  I never saw him.  No.  Tool in concert rolls.  Amazing.  Well, now here's the second reason I hate this song is because, like Anthony said, 
[01:14:30]  it's a bit generic.  It just, it, there was all that prototypical grunge rock that started coming out in the  very late 90s.  That song, the other one I fucking hated was the one, uh, uh, uh, oh, man.  What was the, ah.  It's so hard to remember things when you're put on the spot.  I will, my, cumbersome.  I can become cumbersome.  Can I go to Iraq for a second? 
[01:15:00]  Iraq, when was the last time you did this bit?  We didn't even go two weeks.  Last time Joe was in. </pre>
