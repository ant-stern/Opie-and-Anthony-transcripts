<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Patrice O'Neal, and Drew Boogie in studio, and Jim Norton calling in from Los Angeles.  The show began with the hosts using highly offensive and insulting language, immediately setting a vulgar tone.  Patrice and Drew engaged in a discussion about race and ethnicity, punctuated by humorous anecdotes and racial stereotypes,  touching upon the perceived lack of strong Black leadership and observations about Barack Obama's name.  Jim Norton detailed his loneliness and strained relationships with other comedians in LA, specifically mentioning negative interactions with Keith and Vos. Patrice shared a crude and sexually explicit story about a former girlfriend. The conversation also covered the stereotypical portrayal of different ethnic groups in commercials, employing numerous ethnic slurs.  A brief discussion about a lottery winner transitioned into a conversation about the lottery dream and its often disappointing reality.  The hosts promoted their upcoming Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe and Jim Norton's HBO special, concluding this segment with a discussion of Drew Boogie's turntable setup and the state of the Nassau Coliseum.

The next segment focused on the NBA's new dress code, sparking a debate about its impact on Black players, particularly the financial burden of maintaining a suit wardrobe. Patrice O'Neal made inflammatory statements connecting the dress code to historical racial injustices. The discussion broadened to include the perceived "cleaning up" of sports, comparing the image of different sports (including hockey fights and Chad Johnson's touchdown celebrations). Opie recounted a story about confronting someone illegally tapping into his restaurant's electricity, revealing a connection to Bernie Goetz.  A call-in segment featured a darkly comedic anecdote about a listener who named their child "Diaz," whose subsequent illness and death were described in detail. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) then called in, discussing his new movie "Doom," his wrestling career, and relationships with other wrestlers. Patrice shared anecdotes from his time writing for the WWF/WWE.

The following segment centered around Patty Jordan, a frequent caller, who revealed she needed to raise $1000 due to medical bills and bank issues. The hosts and Patrice engaged in sexually charged and offensive jokes at her expense, speculating about prostitution and fetishization.  They discussed her lack of sexual experience at age 50, using vulgar language and sexual innuendo. A phone call seemingly confirmed Patty's gambling habit. The conversation then explored her traumatic upbringing in a foundling home, her strict Catholic background, and her abandonment by her mother, who possibly worked in burlesque.  Christy, a fired *Apprentice* contestant, was interviewed, with the hosts playing a "You're a Filthy Whore" sound clip, causing her discomfort.  Big A, a cab driver and friend of the show, discussed his new website.  Further discussion ensued about Patty's dating life, including a failed date with Big A.  The hosts also engaged in offensive jokes about Bill, an intern, focusing on his appearance and perceived mental state, discussing plans to make him a "star."  Throughout this segment, highly offensive and vulgar language was consistently used, targeting Patty, Christy, and Big A with racist, sexist, and ableist remarks.

The next segment focused on a running gag about Bill's bad breath, with increasingly vulgar descriptions and speculation about its source (hemorrhoids, thrush, etc.). Danny, the cameraman, was involved in recording Bill's reactions.  Big A attempted a stand-up routine, punctuated by interruptions from the hosts, particularly due to his speech impediment.  A prerecorded promo for a date between Big A and Patty played. A listener called in suggesting "cocksackie disease." The segment ended with a discussion about a man with a $241,000 strip club bill, followed by a call from a listener with a similar experience.  The hosts promoted upcoming events, including their Halloween party, Jim Norton's HBO special, and open auditions for new show characters.

Finally, a caller discussed their post-*Apprentice* business ventures, including real estate and a partnership with Go Smile. The hosts briefly discussed their predictions for the *Apprentice* winner. The segment concluded with a humorous sound bite of Donald Trump saying "Oh, okay," followed by a "Program complete" sound effect.

[00:06:00]  Drew Boogie.  In studio.  Right.  Funks play.  Well, the show just...  It's too black today, man.  Not really.  Between Patrice O'Neal and his spin on life and Drew Boogie spinning light-skinned and...  You think Drew Boogie's blacking up the show?  Yeah, he's like a Latin kind of look, dude.  Hawk blacks up the show more than Drew Boogie.  He could be Dominican.  I could be.  I'm just light-skinned Jamaican.  Are you Jamaican?  Yeah.  Light-skinned Jamaican. 
[00:06:30]  How does that happen?  Wow.  Jamaican.  There's a lot of mixing going on down in the islands.  Which one of your parents, you know, was doing the wrong thing?  It was the grandparents.  Oh, the grandparents.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the parents came out all mixed up.  What?  So you got that one relative that's really white that just looks out of place?  There's a lot of white Jamaicans down here for some reason, man.  There's white Jamaicans, Chinese Jamaicans, the old school.  All right, let's slow down with the Chinese Jamaicans.  No, it's true.  All right.  Chinese Jamaicans.  I can handle no MSG, man.  I got cousins named Woon.  Shit like that, yeah. 
[00:07:00]  Really?  Woon?  Woon.  You look like you might have a little Asian in you.  Yeah.  Do you?  I hope not.  You hope not?  Can I get a number tree with extra duck sauce for you?  Okay, delivery be there in 10 minutes.  We're off to a good start.  Delivery.  Delivery.  The number tree, please.  With the egg roll, please. 
[00:07:30]  Likes getting Chinese Jamaicans.  Give me the Bumba Clout.  The girl is coming to a complete stoppage.  Sometimes you see some guys that are, I mean, white.  They're white guys.  Yeah, you see it on the news, and it goes, a black activist, and they give a name, and  the guy walks out, and you're like, wow, that guy, there's no trace of black in him.  And he's talking, like, about the cause and everything, and he gets up to the podium,  and I just look and go, oh, my God, how many guys like that did I just say some inappropriate  shit in front of over the world?  It doesn't really matter. 
[00:08:00]  Because black people are the only people that don't vote for their leaders.  Because our leaders are, somebody told us, that's our leader.  All right, Chinese black man is our leader?  No problem.  You got it, gookie nigga.  It's all up to you to know the plight.  You're the man.  It's weird.  We don't vote for any of our leaders, man.  No.  Everybody says, okay, all right, Al, that's up.  Al Sharpton's all right.  Yeah.  Cool, nobody else.  He's the guy. 
[00:08:30]  All right, well.  What the fuck?  Why is that?  You guys need some strong motherfucker to just step up.  That can really, like, pull everyone together.  Well, everybody likes this Obama guy, young kid.  Yeah, but his name scares the shit out of white people.  Yeah, but he has the Obama's name.  Obama sounds like Osama, fuck him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Osama, fuck him.  That's what people are saying.  Obama sounds like Osama.  No, not too much Osama.  That ain't winning.  That's like, you know, Badoff Dittler is running. 
[00:09:00]  You know, let's fucking, let me cast my vote.  Badoff Dittler.  Badoff Dittler.  That's a good guy.  Look at his platform.  It's great.  If the guy agrees with everything I say about it, you're going to pull the fucking handle  for him?  Joseph Singular.  Yeah.  You really should change his name.  Joe Singular.  Change that fucking name, Obama.  You do a lot better.  Yeah, well.  Yeah, it is Obama's, but you know what?  He has to, that's the way you pass it off because he's so eloquent. 
[00:09:30]  He's like the eloquent enough to where white people go, wow, he's so, but he has that  name and black people go, okay, brother.  Well, the Colin Powell, that was, you know, Whitey was ready to just cast the vote just  to look good and go, look, see what a good guy I am?  And then he fucked up with Bush.  He fucked up by going to the UN with all that information he had.  He might as well just held up the weekly world news and said, and we're going to catch Bat  Boy, Bat Boy's in trouble with that shit he was fucking, I don't care who you are, at 
[00:10:00]  some point, man, you get black guilt, man, where you just, you hang around with no white  people.  It'll happen to me soon.  Yeah.  As I'm looking, come in the morning, I'm looking at your face and Opie, I'm like, you cracker  mother.  You know what?  Fuck this shit.  Fight the power, I got to be white power.  You're still thankful to be here.  You know what?  You just need a guy, though, to come up to you and go, my brother, what are you doing  with your life, my brother?  You up there with those Opie's and those Anthony's, brother. 
[00:10:30]  The white devil.  The white devil.  The white devil is up there, and he's getting in your mind, my brother.  And Patrice will sit there and go, you know, this motherfucker's right.  You know what?  Let me tell you, man.  I am getting old.  I'm so far away from, like, somebody guilting me with the black guilt shit.  Yeah.  I started, because, you know, I started comedy in Boston, man, so it was nothing but Irish.  Oh, Irish.  Right, right.  It was my mentors, so a lot of the cats would do, like, only black rooms, saying, oh, man, 
[00:11:00]  this nigga, man, doing white boy shit.  So I went through that early, man.  Oh, shit.  My career, I'm like, man, you out of your fucking mind if I sit there and let you, like,  fucking guilt nigga me in the, like, not doing what I feel like doing.  My brother, what are you doing, my brother?  You got to stick together.  Yeah, and then, you know, you do get a little older and wiser and just turn around and go,  you know, fuck you, man.  And my girlfriend's half white, too, so I can't be, like, extra.  Oh, really?  Yeah, my mama got half and half.  Yeah, my mama's cracking, so. 
[00:11:30]  Got a crack of mama.  Totally white mama?  White.  Oh, my.  White as big.  White mama, boy.  Like, what the cheese?  What are you doing, my brother?  What are you doing with that half a hunky?  I only met with one white girl in my life, like, actually, you know, hung out with her,  and she felt she was starting to fall in love with me.  And what happened was, you know, the black Israelites.  Uh-huh.  Those are some angry motherfuckers. 
[00:12:00]  Well, she, this girl was a trooper because she would come in and go right to the room  and just take her clothes.  It was just genius how much of a trooper she was.  So she would just go in, take clothes, and just be ready.  No.  But at some point, she started to catch feelings how women do, man.  So she said, like, because she used to come in, take the train over.  Yeah.  And take the train.  Wow.  A trooper.  Convenience.  And she was around for a long time.  And then finally, I said, let me give you a ride in the city one day.  I was feeling good. 
[00:12:30]  And I dropped, you know, the Israelites.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Read that.  And Cracker's eyeballs.  Oh, yeah.  Be looking at you, you know.  And Hunky's breast steak.  You know, so she dropped.  We had kingdoms built up before white man was crawling out of the caves.  On their hairy bellies.  On their hairy bellies.  Read that passage, brother.  You know the Neanderthal evil devil.  So what happened is it was I was on the Caroline's to do a show.  And, you know, there's no parking camp, but it was a perfect parking spot right there. 
[00:13:00]  But the Israelites was doing this.  Right there where the white girl was in my passage.  So she goes, they go one day.  I go, oh.  Oh, um, I think I'm going to park.  Because sometimes that's, no, no, no.  It's Sunday.  You can park there all day.  Listen, Cracker, I can't park there.  Look, take a look at our brother over here.  Diluting the blood of our princesses and princesses, queens, and kings. 
[00:13:30]  You just want to do a stupid comedy.  Like, I just want to go downstairs, man.  And I couldn't let her out the car.  Yeah.  When they was like, uh-huh, see?  And I had the red caddy at the time.  The big red caddy.  Oh, no.  I just look ridiculous.  What are they going to tell you?  What are they going to fucking, you know, you can turn around just go, motherfucker, she  takes the train.  What are they going to say?  The first day I decided to help this, Huggy.  I should have said, get out the car, parole officer. 
[00:14:00]  Giving a little shit.  I'm sure you put lie in your hair to straighten it out, too, my brother.  White people have no, you don't have pressure on each other to, like, there's no white pressure,  dude.  Like, oh, man, look at you making Italians look bad with you, whatever.  It's just not going to happen.  Although, I've goofed on the real fucking, like, WAP Guinea thing. 
[00:14:30]  That just gets me.  And for some reason, it's completely accepted on television, where, if you put black guys  on TV going, well, let me tell you about KFC, motherfucker, this should be some fabulous  ride.  And niggas would be like, what?  They'd be going, what the fuck?  You'd see a protest in front of there.  But you could get the most guido motherfucker going, yeah, the fucking olive god, my friends  are visiting from Sicily, all the fucking garlic bread you need. 
[00:15:00]  Like, just acting like, you know, there should be a parking lot full of Camaro Z-28.  Wait a minute.  But I'm sitting there going, and what's the problem here?  Yeah, problem?  What's the, uh, I thought that's how you're talking.  It's a fucking olive, Brandy.  Hey, hey, come on, Maria, get in the fucking car, you cunt motherfucker.  I love this fucking bitch.  Wait a minute, but our Italians sitting there going, like, oh, see, this is some bullshit.  This is body making us look like that.  Any of those commercials. 
[00:15:30]  There's somewhere this guy's going, mamma mia, this is a great pizza place.  And you're like, what the?  Wait a minute, though.  So what would the average, what would the average, uh, Italian dude be?  Like, what would be the perfect commercial?  Average should be like, hey, come down to Petrocelli's Pizza Parlor, you know?  Not like, it doesn't have to be some kind of fucking, you know, the guy wearing the big hat and the little mustache that he tweaks between his thumb and fucking pointer finger. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, mamma mia, this is a good pizza pie.  Good, uh.  Yeah.  It's a good, uh.  Just add good.  Any of that shit.  It's a good, good, delicious, uh.  It's like, you know, a bar with an Irish guy, you know?  Hey, glory be, come down and get drunk like all of us Irish folk do.  But my boy, uh, he's Jamaican and he hates, uh, he can't stand the hooray beer guy.  And like, when you're not the ethnic group, you don't know who is accepting, like, okay, black, like, I bet you if you do watch, hey, motherfuckers, come get some chicken, there's mad grease on it. 
[00:16:30]  Right?  People are watching, like, oh, I love this commercial.  Black people are like, I know I just didn't see the dude go.  He can come get some mad grease.  So, it's like, I'm watching the hooray beer guy and I'm like, you know, he's like, do, do, do, do, do.  Hey, hooray beer, you know?  Hooray beer.  You know, red stripe. 
[00:17:00]  And it's like, and I'm sitting there like, I love this guy.  And my boy, Jamaican, he's like, man, this motherfucker, I want this motherfucker, damn.  But I'm like, is he, I didn't like, okay, so then that, that day.  Damien Marley's song come out and, uh, uh, welcome to gem rock, right?  And I'm like, is that, like, now I'm asking him, am I allowed to, like, is he?  And he's like, nah, that's, you know, that's Bob Marley's son, that dude's, you know, I guess Bob Marley's sons across the board just get respect.  Right, right, yeah.  But I'm like, okay, I'm not sure because it, the hooray beer guy didn't look, like, disrespectful to me. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  I'm like, oh, I like this guy.  He's dancing, he's a nice guy.  Wouldn't you like to be there, have a red stripe?  Yeah, have a red stripe with me, yeah.  That's what I want to do.  And he's like, I'll, fuck you, so loud ass you make it, I'll kill this nigga.  And it's like, like, he really, and I'm like, I don't, I don't know.  Yeah.  So the Olive Garden thing is like, come here, you fuck, yeah.  And I'm like.  It's the group that get, yeah, it's the, whoever the group is.  Because the Olive Garden commercials do, they get me like, ah, just a bunch of greasy wops 
[00:18:00]  sitting there just being completely stereotypical.  And yeah, but anybody else watching just goes, oh, I'll go down there.  You really care, though.  It's some shitty food.  You really care deep down there.  No, I don't care where it's like, I want to go and kill the motherfucker.  Right.  But it's, it's like, you're like, ah.  I get more pissed that there are other groups, blacks especially, that you just can't do  that with.  The closest thing is like the Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial, where the old school guys  are going, back in our day, it was Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
[00:18:30]  Well.  Because they call it KFC now.  BET, if you watch BET, there'll be a thousand different commercials.  Malt liquor?  Other than, not malt liquor, there'll be like McDonald's and stuff, but it'll always,  the new black thing is to make it jazzy, to, it's a jazz feel like, oh, two old beef patties,  special sauce, lettuce, chicken, oh, yeah.  Come on down, get a delicious burger, because it's fruitly doodly, baby.  Oh, sizzling, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  And the voice of the guy, come down to McDonald's, today you get your silver.  Yeah.  It just, it gets a little, it's not like so stereotypical, look at this.  Fuck it.  God damn it.  Oh, man.  Someone just won $340 million.  Look at this, he dressed for the occasion.  Holy crap.  That guy is wearing a, where's the guy from?  Oregon, I think.  Oh, all right.  I'm sorry, dude, that just, I just, I tried to keep that out of my life.  You played the lottery?  God, I don't, it's just because there's too much pain, it's the, just the dream and, and 
[00:19:30]  you know a guy with no money is a guy that, that when, when, when, when you hear poor people  talk about winning the lottery.  Yeah.  They go, what kind of car would you buy?  It's like, I, I just don't want to get, like, I guess I started getting really deep into the  lottery dream.  Yeah, what I'm going to do, surprise my mother with a house and a, and a beamer and it's  just like, let me not get into that matrix, man.  Yeah, because then it's just disappointment.  Now you're disappointed like you actually had a shot at that shit. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, I just don't, yeah.  I took me right off of that, that 3-4, I'm sorry about that, that shit.  That's okay.  It causes me pain, dude.  I'm sorry, man.  All right, listen, why don't we go to the phone here, our buddy's checking in.  Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  Jimmy Norton, live from L.A., everybody.  Oh, Jimmy.  Hey, morning, Jim.  How's there filming the HBO series?  How's it going, Jimmy?  Good, and Patrice, believe me, I think your mother is helping you hit the lottery, too.  All you have done in this business is fucking isolate people who like you. 
[00:20:30]  Not really, I, we still, we still like Patrice.  I love you, pumpkin.  I know it's going to turn eventually, but, uh.  Yeah, you'll, you'll like it.  You'll not like it.  I just can't stay liked.  That's why it's like, okay, thanks for asking me to come in once a couple of months.  I love Patrice.  He's one of my favorite people ever, and I'm listening to this whole conversation, and  you're the fucking, you're the worst representative for black people.  You're not a good black guy.  I'm a great black guy.  See, I'm a, I'm a newfangled black guy.  This is Daniel Jackson's friend in school days.  That's who you are. 
[00:21:00]  Which, which, which, oh, the one that goes, yeah, sucker.  I'm, I'm just a bad human, but I, I, I just love, I love black people.  One thing I don't is that there's no, like, okay, there should be a group of white people  rising up against Norton for what he is.  You know what I mean?  Like, this is, this is not who we are.  Right.  We are not creepy little mushy aliens from big, poke-eyed doughboys.  We're not.  There is a group rising up against him.  It's called All Women in Los Angeles. 
[00:21:30]  Are you getting somebody, are you getting laid out there, dude?  Um, I, one person I kind of hooked up with a little bit, but not really, man.  I mean, my esteem is too low to go out and try to hit on girls, and I, I'm working every  day, so it's, I've just kind of, pretty much just stayed at work, and then come home and  isolate.  I haven't done much out here.  No, L.A.'s nice and lonely, isn't it?  It really is depressing.  I was on the phone with my stupid friend, and I, I wouldn't let her get off the phone.  I was just so happy to talk to somebody from New York.  It really, it really is.  When I was out there, he was calling, you know, Norton doesn't call anybody here.  No.  He calls Norton, he doesn't get back to you. 
[00:22:00]  He's busy, busy, busy.  I was in L.A., he kept, because I got friends in L.A., Norton doesn't have any yet.  Aww.  And he has to hang out with Rick Shapiro and those bunch of sociopaths, you know?  So, he's like, hey, man, what are you doing?  You should have heard him, like a morning DJ.  Hey, I'm out here in L.A., come on, hang on.  Hey, fucking Patrice gives me the worst Patrice blow-off.  This is how he blows you off.  You're like, hey, man, what's going?  When you talk for a minute, he's like, hey, man, are you going to be opening your email later?  Or, hey, are you going to be around a little bit later on?  Or are you going to be hugging?  Oh, oh, in other words.  It's always a little later. 
[00:22:30]  In other words, not now.  Yeah, a little later never comes.  Hold up, hold up, hold up, Jim.  Hold up, I'm going to call you right back.  Like something urgent just came in.  And there's nothing going on.  I didn't feel like a little quiet, like someone gets when they get a phone call,  so no one's calling him.  He's just done talking to you, and he fucking can't just say it.  Wow.  You're just an awful friend.  No one likes you.  I love you.  We love you, but you're not a fucking nice person.  I'm out here alone, and you could have called me.  And fucking Keith comes to the improv, and Keith is just an embarrassment. 
[00:23:00]  Because what he'll do is he'll try trashing you just to show how comfortable he is  when he's fucking terrified because nobody cares about him in life.  Oh, he really does get confidence off the back of his friends.  Really?  Look at your coat.  Ain't that funny, Damon Wayans?  Hey, Eddie Murphy, look at his shoes.  Good one, Keith.  Are you cracking on my feet in front of Eddie Murphy?  You fucking pussy.  As soon as he gets out here, he tries to show people how free and funny he is, 
[00:23:30]  but the only one he's comfortable enough shitting on is me.  It's embarrassing, and it's uncomfortable.  It's nothing worse than it is so true.  Ah, look at you.  Ah, your head's big.  What a prick.  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy, we had Vossen the other day, and he came in to hang with us,  and everything was going great, and then he just attacked all of us  for not showing up at Caroline's for his post-wedding party.  Really?  Yeah, and he said it was a big deal, and we should have been there,  and it was his official wedding reception for his New York friends. 
[00:24:00]  He pulled out invites from Ben, Steve, and Master Poe.  They said they were going to attend, and they never showed,  so he's calling everyone out like crazy on the show.  Yeah, he brought in evidence.  Well, first of all, he's lucky Ben didn't show up,  or he'd owe about three times as much as he did.  The damage he would have done at the bar on a fucking Thursday for free  would have been a major problem.  It would have been...  Nothing on that one?  All right.  Well, I was helping you.  I was going to say...  No, that's all right.  I was going to say, hey, it would have been ugly.  We understood it even before you went into the explanation 
[00:24:30]  after the part that should have got the laugh.  I sensed it had nothing, and so I figured just keep talking  until someone else...  Right.  But he was very hurt that we weren't there.  Really?  Very hurt.  It's 4.30 in the morning.  You're in L.A.  I know.  What are you doing up, Jimmy?  You're a fucking lonely idiot.  Listen, I'm going to bed soon.  I have a late call.  We were at 8 o'clock in the morning yesterday,  so I have a 1 o'clock call this afternoon.  Hold on.  A call, Patrice, is when you have to be someone else.  Oh.  Okay. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, Jimmy.  I'm kidding, babe.  You know I'm kidding.  Babe, how's the shooting going?  It's good, man.  It's fun.  How many in the can?  Four.  We're shooting the second...  We're shooting the fourth one now.  All right.  It's going very well.  All right.  How's that doughy skin under those TV lights?  It's just me, Tony.  I'm not in enough steam.  It's not like to do any damage.  I just kind of show up.  By the time it heats up, I'm finished.  Hey, Lord, yeah, you got a nice spongy's.  Hey, like a pizza dough. 
[00:25:30]  Like a pizza dough.  That's what a Jimmy's like, with a too big a pepperoni eye.  Can you picture Bob Kelly throwing me up in the air?  Angry baby.  Spinning him around, kneading his little belly, watching it rise overnight.  Oh, my God.  You're wonderful.  It's 4.30 in the morning, man. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  That worked both ways, because I can picture Bob throwing him up as Angry Baby, too.  Yeah.  Because Bob does the Angry Baby voice.  Yeah, Angry Baby, Joe Pesci.  Joe Pesci.  Same thing.  A couple things with Jimmy.  A week from Monday, you'll be back on the show here in New York, right?  Yeah, for the week, man.  Yeah, I'm coming back for the Halloween party.  And he's coming back for the Halloween party.  Yeah, the Halloween party, a week from Monday at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Are you wearing a costume, Jimmy?  Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to be yet.  It's going to be a big surprise, guys.  Ooh, I can't wait.  Yeah.  A lot of people asking how to get tickets for this shindig. 
[00:26:30]  You just got to show up and hope for the best.  Where's it going to be?  At the Hard Rock Cafe, Halloween night.  Yeah, maybe.  Over here?  Yeah, we got three tribute bands.  We got 2U, Brother Joe's U2 tribute band.  Then we had the other bands in yesterday, the Rush tribute band and ACDC tribute band.  Yep.  So it's going to be great.  How are they?  It was awesome.  We had a good show yesterday.  It was fun.  And then we're going to have a costume contest and all that.  If you're going to the Halloween party, you've got to have a costume that has something to do with our radio show.  Yeah.  A little twist on the whole Halloween costume thing.  Really?  Well, maybe can somebody show up and just not talk to me when we're in a different state, and they can go with Patrice. 
[00:27:00]  Maybe that would be nice.  I really need to know that here.  You son of a bitch.  You have all the connections.  And then tonight, Jimmy, is a big night for you.  Yeah, yeah.  I felt bad yesterday.  I was going to call him, but I was so depressed when I woke up.  And I was like, I couldn't just call him plug.  I kind of felt like fucking guilty.  Like, I can't just call him plug.  Why were you depressed, Jimmy?  Oh, I don't know.  The guilt's over now.  Plug away.  Tonight.  Midnight.  HBO.  Yeah, HBO.  Oh, this is special.  That's right.  HBO special tonight with Jimmy Norton.  Have you noticed any difference in yours? 
[00:27:30]  Like, I haven't been talking to people.  Like, have you noticed if all of a sudden the phone rings more, or is it just pretty much like people who saw it saw it and who didn't didn't?  No, your phone will ring.  Just the people who really like you, you'll hear from.  Parents and shit like that and some friends.  Yeah, but my mother already had the tape, so she saw it, and she was just, I can hear, you hate when you know somebody so well and you know they're disappointed.  Oh, and my mother goes, she just goes, yeah, yeah, because I was just, your mom did that to you?  Oh, and my mother just does not fuck around when she, she just goes, she can't, she can't lie to me. 
[00:28:00]  Because you're despicable to women?  Yeah, and she just, and she got to work with people, you know what I mean?  And a lot of people know her as my, as my mother, you know, whatever, and they just got, she just went, um.  And here you are, just misogynistic embarrassment.  Oh, just, she, because she really hasn't really interacted with me in the last eight years in terms of living.  Living with me, so she just didn't know I've developed this to be a complete ass.  Wait, did you ever tell them, I don't mean to interrupt you, Patrice is the greatest, did you ever tell them about the, uh, the fat bitch from the Wiz? 
[00:28:30]  Wait, wait, what, what, don't!  Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?  You laughed through it, I didn't even hear you.  It's, uh, let's just say, uh, look, she doesn't listen to this show, uh, a girl that he used to see, and he referred to her as the fat bitch from the Wiz.  She used to work at the Wiz, and, uh, when I first moved to Jersey City, she, she, she, she, she, she was,  she was the first one to, um.  To receive your seed?  Yeah, she's the first one, and she was great, man.  And we call her the fat bitch from the Wiz.  Fat bitch from the Wiz.  And, uh, I used to live up this spiral staircase, and I tried to sneak her in a sneaker. 
[00:29:00]  She was at least 400 pounds.  And, uh, and she just, and, and my roommate, you know, he, he was on the phone.  This would kill me.  He was waiting on the phone, because he heard me sneak a girl up.  So he's really like one of those guys that go, he, he, I'm gonna peek at the girl coming out.  Yeah.  So he was standing there at the, on the phone talking, right?  And I come down, and I was trying to sneak her down.  He was right there, and I couldn't do nothing to mush her out, mush her away.  And she comes down, you know, just one of those, you know, each step was a, so she gets to the bottom, 
[00:29:30]  and he goes, hey, what's up, Patrice?  How you doing?  And I go, fuck, he didn't laugh or nothing, so when I got her outside, I came back up.  He was on the floor, in tears, laughing at how big this girl was.  Like, she was, she was, she was, you know, but I never even, no one ever, I never said her name.  I just called her the fat bitch from the wind.  That was the best part.  You're like, what are you doing tomorrow?  He's like, I don't know, I might call her the fat bitch from the wind. 
[00:30:00]  No name.  But there was no malice in it.  It was just, this is what she is.  She's a non-person.  She is fat, she works at the whiz.  Yeah, she was fat.  Where's the problem?  It was just bullet accuracy.  I'm trying to do better now.  Hold on, hold on, did you always take her upstairs to your apartment at least and show her like a dignified time?  No, I took her in the basement sometime.  This fucking piece of garbage would take this. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, the apartment building basement.  Into the apartment basement and jerk off on her on a mattress in the basement.  What?  You had a mattress, it was just some old mattress laying out there?  It was just like in the basement, the mattresses.  I put two, it was two, somebody left office desks down there.  Yeah.  So I pushed the two office desks together and laid a piece of wood and then put some on top.  It's like where Al-Qaeda hold their prison.  That's what it was.  It was like a serial killer's lair.  And it was just because I didn't want to, I just didn't want to bring her upstairs and go through the, through the. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  She was, I hate, you know, and you hate to really, it's because it sounds so disrespectful.  Yeah.  But you know how you do with your friends, you know, I had a fat bitch from the Wiz.  But just, she was such a troupe, like she was, she was good in the sack because she had to be.  And she was probably one of the best, gave the best head in, in the history of head, man.  And she had no problem that you would treat her like that.  But that was her, that was her, and, and the thing about it, what was great about it is that she saw me with this girl, like that was a little bit pretty in her. 
[00:31:30]  And she called me and said, look, I got jealous.  She was so business-like.  She said, look, I got jealous.  And I realized that I'm starting to catch feelings.  I'm not going to call you anymore.  And she never talked to me again.  Wow.  She was, because she's, a fat girl like that feels like, you know, that's the beautiful women are the ones that stalk you.  Because they're like, how dare you, you mother of you.  How dare you leave me, you cocksucker.  And this one was like, you know what, I saw this girl, she just looked way better than me, I'm a fat bitch, and I got to go. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you very much.  Wow.  What do you think she was thinking when you got to your apartment and you didn't have the human decency to bring her up the steps like fucking cattle?  Well, we, well, we had already, we had already established, like, the filth.  Like, you know, we just did, you know, we would do it in the car.  It would never be, you know, it never was, intimacy was never established.  No movie dates.  No, but how do you size up these girls?  I mean, you're with these girls and you're bringing them back to your apartment. 
[00:32:30]  What is the criteria to make it up to, upstairs to your regular room?  And what's the criteria to go down and go to the dungeon?  Anybody that is, after, after a long career of manipulating, you know, my self-esteem is low too.  But this idiot, he knows too.  It's just like, imagine what he does to women too.  Oh yeah.  You know, fucking suicidal maniac from South Jersey.  At least I have the guise of dignity.  At least I say good dignity.  No, no, no.  At least you say you do, you asswipe.  You, you, you, shut your face.  You masturbate on a girl who makes $3.35 an hour in a basement. 
[00:33:00]  You're a fucking person.  You spend thousands of dollars on watches.  And you know he, you know he talked her into using that employee discount at the Wiz for  a few items, right?  You get what, 10, 20% off?  What do you get?  Hey, she was a, she, it's weird in a, in a, in a, in a real dysfunctional way.  She was just a, she was a good girl.  Yeah.  She was what she wanted.  You need that.  It was almost like, this is, this is really bad, but it's, it was, it was like, it was 
[00:33:30]  a, a, a human jerk off.  Does that make sense?  It's like, if I thought of jerking off, I would think of, like, I was just going to  grab her and just have some, you know what I mean?  Some stimulation.  Stimulation, yeah, you know what I mean?  Some visual stimulation.  She was just available like that, man.  And it's like, I appreciated her being available like that.  Yeah.  I'd give her car fare and things like that, and I'd give her gas money.  Oh, see, what a guy.  There you go.  I'd give her gas money. 
[00:34:00]  Gas money, that's wonderful.  How fucking degrading is that?  Hey, look, here's a fiver.  It was better than nothing, you know what I'm saying?  It was like, you know, I'm a, it seems disgusting, or, but I'm a decent dude.  There's some women who just, their job is to be, you know, your, your.  You're a decent dude.  I am, I'm decent.  Really?  You know what I mean?  When you fly below the equator to fucking pay poverty-stricken women to lick your nipples  and I, hey, listen, some guys go out there and brutalize. 
[00:34:30]  You know how gentle I am with a woman, Jimmy.  You are gentle.  I'm not saying you're mean.  They love Patricky.  Patricky?  Yeah, Patricky.  What's that?  Oh, Patricky, because they can't say Patrice.  Holy crap.  Look who's fucking talking about Patrice when he was sitting on the same plane.  Dude, I.  Where were you going, a diplomatic mission down there?  I'm filth.  I, I, I'm garbage, but he's saying I'm a decent, he really thinks that he's this fucking  gentleman underneath this little situation.  I, I'm a filth, I know how to separate my filth from, you know, I'm, I'm a filthy dude. 
[00:35:00]  I'm, I'm loving to him.  It's like, I could be loving.  You know, the, the famous Kamo, Kamo.  Yeah, man.  You make them feel comfortable.  I make them feel good.  And you jerk off on their face.  Yes.  What's the, I mean, you don't even see, like, how that, some guys, you can just do anything  to them.  The last thing of you guys sometimes is just amazing.  I know.  It's just, there is.  You're trying to say you're better than Jimmy.  I am better than Jimmy.  You walk around with a briefcase of glass dildos.  Oh, well, that's the old Patrice.  Jimmy walks around with a belly button full of shit. 
[00:35:30]  But the last time you were here, you walked out with two Liberators, one under each arm.  You haven't changed.  At least I'm convenient for them.  At least you're now buying, like, well, you didn't buy it, but at least you're getting  a Liberator, a nice sex couch instead of a cum-stained fucking mattress in a basement.  One of my fondest memories was being in Brazil.  It was, like, one of our first nights in this whorehouse, and we're both wearing robes.  And I think I took 100 milligrams of Viagra. 
[00:36:00]  And I was fucking popping a rod in the robe, and we were both just looking at it, giggling  like five months.  And Norton is packing a Wormster.  It's ridiculous, the jammy that Norton had.  It just doesn't make any sense at all, man.  Dude, we just looked at the fucking rod, and you couldn't see it.  And it was the only thing hard on his body.  His fingers ain't even hard.  It's just like...  Norton is a knuckle with a huge, giant dick.  It's just ridiculous, man.  It was sickening to me.  And everybody was popping Viagra, but I couldn't, because, you know, I got the blood pressure, 
[00:36:30]  so it's like that would just kill me.  Yeah, you don't want to raise that up.  So everybody's just walking around with these huge veins.  Holy shit.  It really was so weird.  I didn't know if it was real.  God damn, that's fucking funny.  Fucking cartoon money.  Look at Anthony, looking at this hurricane, like my vacation.  I'm just looking like, well, it looks like by two...  Now it's Tuesday?  Tuesday.  I'm fine.  I'm fine, too.  We're flying tomorrow. 
[00:37:00]  They're looking at this.  Ants flying today, and I'm flying tomorrow.  Where you guys going?  You going to Florida?  Yeah.  I got to go to...  I'm doing some diving, actually.  Oh.  I'm doing some diving.  I got to get to Miami, and then I'm taking another plane from there.  Dude, what the fuck are you doing?  You're going to run into the hurricane.  I know.  I don't give a fuck.  It's moving.  Yeah, I give a fuck, dude.  I give a fuck.  Ah, we've had good careers.  I don't give a fuck.  You guys have had good careers.  I'm getting rolling.  Let's not fucking do anything rash here.  Why don't you guys just stay in town?  I'm going diving with sharks, Jimmy. 
[00:37:30]  He said don't put my career in jeopardy.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm fucking...  I'm so, like, protective of these two.  It's like, just don't go anywhere.  Like, send the fucking reach off and stay in the house.  Hold on.  He's so full of shit.  I know.  You know he's something to practice in how to run the show by himself?  Yeah.  He watches the buttons every time Opie pushes it.  All right.  Hey, come on.  This is the Jim Norton Show on XM.  Hey, Jimmy Norton.  I'm back.  I'm too lazy to do that shit.  He has a nanny cam in here somewhere.  He's been taking video of everything.  We're taking your phone calls.  And now he's just looking at the tapes in his lonely L.A. room. 
[00:38:00]  I am too fucking lazy to plan a coup.  I just like to fucking show up and sit there and throw out the occasional joke and go,  hello, check.  Good soldier.  We had a general manager in Boston that did that exact thing.  He did not want Anthony and I to drive back to Long Island to see our families.  Remember Bruce Mittman would get all panicky when it was time to go home for a weekend  or a holiday or something.  He's like, he would try to talk us into staying in Boston because we were the whole station.  Boys, you have airbags in your vehicles, don't you? 
[00:38:30]  Newer vehicles.  We were his cash cows.  All right, Jimmy, we've got to let you go.  I'm going to go to bed, man.  Thank you for calling.  We appreciate it.  The HBO thing sounds like it's going great.  And, of course, the half-hour comedy special tonight at midnight.  Yeah, have a great vacation.  I'll see you guys right back.  And Patrice, I'll talk to you this week.  No, you won't.  Bye, sweetie.  I'm hanging out.  Our next live show is a week from Monday and Jimmy will be in studio.  Bye, little sweetie.  We'll call you after the show, Jimmy.  Bye, buddy.  All right, there he goes.  Jimmy Norton, everyone.  Bye, sweetie.  Drew Boogie in studio.  He does this before vacation every time. 
[00:39:00]  So I want you to play a little something to get us out of here for a little while, Drew.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That fucking thing fell again.  Fell again.  Right on my fucking foot. 
[00:39:30]  Fell again.  Fell again.  Right on my fucking foot.  Right on my fucking foot. 
[00:40:00]  Right on my fucking foot.  Right on my fucking foot.  Right on my fucking foot. 
[00:40:30]  Right on my fucking foot.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's in my shoes.  Ramone, clean this up.  We have Anthony here.  XM202.  Let my pizza.  Come on.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow. 
[00:41:00]  Ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  The End 
[00:41:30]  Come on. 
[00:42:00]  That's fantastic, man.  True boogie.  That's that chick that's still out of the fucking grave.  True boogie came to play today.  I got to ask Drew.  I'm not fucking around this day.  I got to ask Drew about his equipment.  Last time you were here, you had a turntable and then you had a CD turntable. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  It's like a CD in there and you fuck with that.  Now you got two turntables with two pretty much albums.  Yeah.  Vinyl albums.  It's coded vinyl.  But what the fuck is that?  Because you're programming shit into a computer and it's playing on the vinyl.  Is that how that's working?  Yeah.  I'm thinking he's at home with fucking vinyl burning machines.  Wait a minute.  Putting this stuff on there.  That's what I thought.  I'm like, how did we get our shit on a fucking record? 
[00:43:00]  So there's some kind of digital code on the albums.  And the turntable picks it up.  And at some point you've programmed.  This is the code right here.  It's just a tone.  And what it does is it runs the computer and all I have to do is just play the song here.  It has a section for the left turntable, section for the right turntable.  And all I have to do is choose the song.  So I can go through the list here and go to, let's see, this. 
[00:43:30]  Now it's the same vinyl spinning.  It's still spinning.  What's on it changes because there's really nothing on it but a digital tone that now  I can instantly change it.  Yeah.  Yeah, the computer's doing it.  So now I can put anything in here that I want and I can spin it just like regular vinyl  like I'm comfortable.  That is fucked up.  I have an observation, though.  I got scared, but now I'm going to breathe a sigh of relief.  When you looked at Drew like, what the hell are you doing over there?  And I'm like, I thought Drew was going to just explain scratching with two turntables to you. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, no, no.  I'm like, where has Anthony been?  What are they doing there, the kids with the record album?  That could ruin the style.  That's what I thought Drew was going to have to explain to Anthony.  I was going to be like, holy shit.  But I didn't see the computer.  It's the digital age, my friend.  Because I saw him.  He hasn't removed the vinyl from the turntable.  Right, and it's playing different sounds.  That's amazing.  His explanation, I still don't get.  Really?  I know what he's doing.  I know what's going on.  Right, right. 
[00:44:30]  Theoretically.  But that's amazing that he's scratching up the computer.  Well, the records are not changing off the turntable.  The computer can identify the tone on the vinyl.  Right.  So the computer knows if it hears such and such a tone to put this music on there, to replace that tone with this music.  Exactly.  That he has chosen.  That could be changed at any time.  Exactly.  So he never has to change vinyl.  He just changes a few things on the computer, and he's got a whole other friggin' album that he'll work with. 
[00:45:00]  So what's it connected to?  It's connected.  What's it connected to?  You see this box over here?  Yeah.  The turntables are connected into that.  That goes into the mixer.  That box connects USB to this laptop.  Oh my God, my brain just exploded.  Thank you.  Fantastic.  And this is what the DJs are doing now because it's much easier than carrying vinyl.  Instead of carrying a whole box full of vinyl.  So this destroys records now.  This destroys records, except for the one company that makes these records.  One company.  The digital record company.  Oh, the digital age is just taking...  Yeah.  Do you look at your CDs at home like, oh my God, CDs?  What the...  And I'm still...  I'm always too... 
[00:45:30]  I mean, I still use...  Two notches behind...  But I still use my CDs, but I can see where this is such a waste of space.  I'm defiant.  Like, if I was a DJ, I'd still be DJ Vinyl Man.  DJ Vinyl Man.  Because it's like, I'm like, F this, man.  I'm going to stay true to the game until I see...  They call him DJ Vinyl Man.  He's not.  It's the motherfuck.  He's still doing it old school.  He's a full technology.  Carry your crates of records.  Yeah.  I keep it real, baby.  And he's like seven steps in.  Like, I refuse to have an iPod just because I go, F you know. 
[00:46:00]  But it's ridiculous not to have an iPod.  So now you still have to carry all your CDs around because you don't want to get the iPod.  In garbage bags.  Dummy.  Yeah.  It's just ridiculous, man.  Still regular techniques, turntables.  Everything else is standard.  This is regular techniques, regular vinyl.  It's just 15 minutes of this tone on it.  And 15 minutes goes right through.  So you can have like a whole song.  I got to ask you another question, a more important question.  Are you starting to make money off this?  No, this, this, well...  No, I mean with doing this.  No, this I just do for fun.  What happened was... 
[00:46:30]  Not with us.  I mean, in your regular life, are you starting to make some cash?  Because the shit you do is unbelievable.  No, I make cash doing other things, not like playing out.  Damn, man.  We got to figure that out for you.  Wait a minute.  No, because I'm cool.  I make...  I do a lot of production, like what Steve uses for the show as far as, you know, sound  effects for the promos and stuff like that.  That's what I do.  And sometimes I put some scratches in there.  What?  Oh, you rent.  That's what you do?  Yeah.  But...  For who?  Just this company?  No, for, you know, all around the world.  A lot of people saying you should be here every Friday. 
[00:47:00]  Every Friday you should be here.  All right.  Drew Boogie in-house today.  Very good, Drew.  Wow.  Bringing in the technology.  Patrice O'Neill, where are you going to be?  We got to get some plugs in for you.  You've been killing for us.  Oh, I'm...  Just hanging?  Yeah, comic strip tomorrow.  You got a website yet or anything?  Yeah, I got a website.  PatriceO'Neill.com.  All right.  I'm just trying...  Like I said, I'm seven notches behind success.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really fast.  He's programming by hand.  Like HTML.  Doesn't even have like a web building program.  He's got a newsletter he nails on. 
[00:47:30]  I got dial-up.  Dial-up.  Yeah, let me get on.  I try to be all defined.  I'm losing.  You got to give in to the technology.  I did.  I did.  Really fast.  This is going to bore Patrice to death, but I was at the Islander game last night, Anthony.  Islanders, Rangers.  What's Islander?  At the Nassau Coliseum.  It's a sport called hockey that the brothers are not into. 
[00:48:00]  Hockey is back.  Oh, wow.  Better than ever.  Shootouts and everything.  Changed some of the rules to excite people.  Wow.  Hockey's back.  I didn't know.  You're kidding, right?  I've never seen a highlight.  Sports doesn't touch on it.  I was saying the same thing the other day.  Sports doesn't touch on it.  Wow.  It's going to...  I think it's going to really start growing again because they changed a lot of the rules  and made the game faster and more exciting.  What's Gretzky doing?  Is he going to score?  They got shootouts.  Gretzky's actually a coach.  He's coaching.  He's coaching.  For the Phoenix Coyotes.  Phoenix Coyotes.  I know. 
[00:48:30]  Phoenix hockey team.  I think he's part owner, too.  I don't know.  How do you do that?  He's got some deal going.  But I went to the Nassau Coliseum, which is just a shithole.  An absolute shithole.  They really need to build a new venue.  It's embarrassing, man, because I'm bringing people to the game because I got four season  tickets.  And it's one of these things I'm doing, you know, bringing people to the game.  And they're from out of town and this and that.  It's like, this is your hockey arena?  It's all dated.  It's a shithole.  The security stinks.  The vendors stink. 
[00:49:00]  You know?  The whole layout is shitty.  We're at our seats, right?  It's Islander Rangers.  This is a huge, huge deal in the New York area, right?  Halfway through the first period, everyone finally got to their seats.  Know why?  They had lines outside the Coliseum that were like 50 to 100 yards long.  People waiting on line to get into the Coliseum.  And we got there around 10 to 7.  Game starts around 7.05, 7.10.  We're like, all right, we made it.  And we were panicking because we were stuck in traffic.  And by the time they let us into the Coliseum, we missed the goal. 
[00:49:30]  We missed the first three minutes of the period.  I'm like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.  I thought they shared the...  They're checking for weapons and stuff, but they're not even checking correctly.  It's like, will you just let us all in and stop this fake security crap?  I thought they shared the Madison Square Garden, those two.  I wish.  I wish.  They occasionally play there, and then the Rangers play...  In my time off, I was traveling a lot, so I got to go to a bunch of hockey arenas.  And what they're doing all over the country, they've got some great arenas out there.  Knock it down. 
[00:50:00]  The concourse is nice and wide with all sorts of choices for food and stuff, and we got this shithole.  You can't even leave in between periods to go to the bathroom because it's such a...  It's like cattle.  It's like cattle in the concourse.  That was built for Long Island.  It was built for Long Island years ago when, you know, there was barely any people.  It was just pretty much for Islanders hockey and some, you know, if Charlie Daniels was coming to town, he'd play there.  Right.  And now it's just undersized.  It's, like you said, the concourse that you have to walk around. 
[00:50:30]  You can't.  It's so narrow that you're just banging into people.  Right.  And then I went to...  Thanks.  I went to opening night.  You would think, after not having hockey for, you know, almost two years, year and a half, whatever, you want to figure out the math yourself, whatever.  Opening night, you think you want to, you know, give everyone a nice presentation.  You know the jumbotron that they have at every arena?  Uh-huh.  It's all fucked up for opening night.  You think they had a year and a half to fix it.  Do they even have a jumbotron, or is it, like, that's still just light bulbs?  Nah, they got, like, some... 
[00:51:00]  Is there an actual screen there?  Yeah, it's not as good as other arenas.  Didn't it fall down once?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, it did.  It almost fell down.  It almost fell down.  Yeah.  But, so, opening night, it's a shithole to begin with, and then they're, you know, telling you to look up on the jumbotron, and there's big chunks of the jumbotron that isn't working, so it's just big black squares where video should be, and, you know, it's one big video screen, technically, right?  Yeah.  But big black squares just missing on opening night. 
[00:51:30]  Knock it down.  Opening fucking night.  But the Islanders beat the Rangers 5-4 last night.  The night before, they beat them 3-2 in a shootout at the Garden.  Very exciting.  They're doing the shootout thing now this year, which is just amazing for hockey.  Oh, no ties, right?  No more ties.  Thank fucking God no ties, right?  What an idea trying to do.  And at the Garden the other night, you know, after regulation, it was 2-2, so they'd do a five-minute overtime, and the whole crowd could care less about the overtime.  They started chanting, shootout, shootout, shootout.  Oh, so it's one overtime and then a shootout.  Yeah, so it's a five-minute overtime. 
[00:52:00]  The overtime ends.  It's still tied.  The Garden goes absolutely nuts, and everyone just stands up and starts freaking out because it's like the first shootout they've seen.  So you think the purists love this or the purists don't?  Are you a purist?  Well, as far as hockey, I think it should go back to the old days where they really roughed it up, bruised it up, let them fight.  Goon it up.  Bench-clearing brawls.  Bench-clearing brawls.  Let the third man in.  No more fighting now.  They're trying to make it more about the skill and speed up the game and get rid of the fighting game. 
[00:52:30]  Mandatory no helmets.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I like.  Yeah, I want goalies with no helmets.  I don't want the plexiglass.  Can I watch it?  No.  No, you're black.  I mean, I used to sell peanuts and popcorn and stuff at the Boston Garden back in the day.  Nah, yeah.  So I'm familiar with hockey a little bit.  Black people just don't like the hockey.  But as a hockey fan, it's better now.  I like it because they got rid of the two-line pass, so it speeds up the game.  And a lot of times when your team had sort of a breakaway or a nice play developing, they would blow the whistle because it was a stupid two-line pass. 
[00:53:00]  They got rid of that so that the sport's faster now.  So you could just have fast breaks, so to speak.  Yeah, you're seeing a lot more fast break type action.  Is it a dress code for hockey players?  Oh, we should get into that, Patrice.  We should get into that.  Do white guys have a dress code or they can just...  No, they don't have a dress code.  Jesus.  Should I have a dress code now?  No, for the NBA.  You heard about this, right?  Yeah.  And Alan Iverson on the news this morning is saying, look, you know, they got to give us a budget. 
[00:53:30]  They should.  They should give us...  Oh, budget!  I swear to God.  Are you shitting me?  If we can find the audio clip...  Well, everyone's outraged.  In the paper today, it was Tim Duncan speaking out saying this is bullshit or whatever.  Well, he didn't say bullshit, but...  Here's what it is.  I would say this.  Let me try to find that quote.  But basically, why don't you explain what's going on for people that don't know?  The NBA basically...  Yeah, David Stern has implemented a dress code.  But see, David Stern is not the boss.  He is the extension of the owners.  He's the commissioner. 
[00:54:00]  So, it's really the owners have voted at some point to make the young hip-hop dudes dress in suits now.  Because they didn't want, like, them showing up wearing gangster attire.  Well, see, this is the thing about basketball.  First thing about the money thing, about the money situation, they should have a stipend to buy the clothes.  You know why?  Because these dudes can...  They're not going to be able to go buy suits from, you know, Sipperstein's suit...  They have to go and have 82 tailor-made suits. 
[00:54:30]  Now, you know black people do not wear the same clothes ever.  So, you're not going to see Shaq in the same suit he wore two weeks ago.  So, he's going to have to have 82 $3,000 suits.  I don't give a shit how much money you...  Now, if somebody asks you...  That's the black man's problem.  I've been wearing the same jeans.  Nigga, it's a black man's sport!  No, I'm just saying about the clothes.  I'm wearing the same jeans all week.  I don't give a shit.  As long as they don't smell.  But that's up with the black guy and his clothes. 
[00:55:00]  I don't get it.  Because the white man made us wear dirty shit all our lives.  Get over it!  We can always go back to slavery.  We had to wear potato sacks, nigga!  Why are you the only ones not getting over slavery?  Motherfucka, y'all were over it when it was going on!  Your old people soldier, get over it!  You were over it when it was happening!  Your old people took the money!  It's that once we get a chance to have some style, we have some style. 
[00:55:30]  This is what I'm saying.  There's no pressure for the white man.  I would love to not have pressure to dress at all.  Why do people just don't have that kind of pressure?  Why do you have to dress so good?  I don't get it.  It's just the rules.  Rules of just being black?  It's the rules of being black.  Like, you have a Boston Red Sox hat on today?  I've seen many, many variations of the Boston Red Sox cap.  I've never seen that one.  I've never seen that one.  I can't even explain it.  It is all red, even the B.  The famous B logo. 
[00:56:00]  Shitload of little B's all over the hat.  And if I wore it on television, I could never wear it again.  Right.  Nigga, you had that hat on last week, nigga!  It's like, you had that hat on on Leno!  I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Memory like a steel trap.  Yeah!  So these dudes, man, look, you have to get your suits tailor-made.  For somebody to tell you that you have a marketable skill.  See, here's the thing I would do.  I would try to find out what the fine is going to be to wear, not to wear the clothes, pay the fine for a year straight, wear what I want. 
[00:56:30]  Probably be cheaper.  It'll be cheaper than to buy 82 suits.  And what it is, is I have a skill.  I can take my skill as a basketball player.  I've worked hard on my jump shot so that I don't have to have somebody tell me I've got to wear some fucking suit.  Patrice, all kidding aside, I'm against this big time.  I think it's ridiculous.  Where are they supposed to wear this?  Before and after the games.  Like, when they come in, they all got to be wearing suits in the locker room, take the suit off, suit up for the game, and then when they leave, again, they got to look so sharp. 
[00:57:00]  They have to wear, you know.  The league has been on the decline for a while.  No decline is making the most money.  No, not like this.  Here's why there's a dress code.  Because you think it's on the decline.  It's the middle-aged white people who vote to these things.  I need to see the numbers now.  Any other sport have a dress code like this?  Football doesn't, no. 
[00:57:30]  Because football doesn't have an image.  Basketball has such a public image for young black kids.  But most of the white guys are the bummiest dudes.  Even when the black guys dress a certain way, it's sharp.  But like, you see the filthy Steve Nash and that filthy Dirk Nowinski?  They look like their name.  They have dirty names.  Dirk Nowinski, filthy, drippy hair.  It makes me sick.  That's the weird part about it.  You know, you see these guys arriving for the games, and so they don't have suits on, but they still dress really nice. 
[00:58:00]  Are you joking me?  What?  A throwback jersey is $350.  No, no, I don't see them.  I see them dressing in, a lot of the guys do dress in suits already, or other clothes that are really, really nice.  Dwayne Wade.  And sometimes they come in with the crazy fur jackets and looking like pimps.  I like that.  Back in early.  I like that shit.  In the mid-80s, right, all the dudes, Jordan, Magic, like I said, I used to work at the Boston Garden.  I would see the guys come in.  Only guys that dressed like bums, Larry Bird and Kevin McHale. 
[00:58:30]  Like complete bums.  I believe that.  Highwaters.  Fucking hayseeds.  Writs showing, Larry Bird dressed like a goddamn pig, and everybody, you should have seen artist Gilmore, Robert Parrish, all in suits and everything else, but there was no hip-hop culture that was dominating.  Is that the problem?  Is that the problem they had?  It's a 22-year-old black man.  He's dressing like a 22-year-old black kid.  And why is that a problem?  Like, I don't see if he comes in...  Because there's a culture associated with hip-hop that's violent and this and that and other things like that. 
[00:59:00]  I'll agree with that.  But I didn't hear one black dude calling in the other day with the gun thing shooting off the door.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yo, yo, son.  Yo, I'm here in South Philly.  Ready?  Yeah, yeah.  Glock 49 stole off this motherfucking cop.  Ready?  Listen.  Bop, bop.  Yeah, nigga.  Chillin'.  They ain't gonna waste any ammo that could be shot into an innocent nine-year-old.  Why the fuck are they gonna waste ammo?  Why people love wasting ammo?  I'll shoot a tree 80 fucking times. 
[00:59:30]  I just hate that, you know, hockey, baseball, football, basketball, they're just trying to clean up their image constantly, man.  Let the NBA guys wear whatever the fuck they want.  Let the fucking guys, after they score a touchdown, dance their asses off and make fools of themselves.  I don't give a shit.  It makes it more entertaining.  They want them to come and dress like John Gotti.  Fucking hockey, the big wigs think, you know, oh, hockey doesn't need fighting anymore.  That's bullshit.  The fans want to see it.  Fighting in hockey, stop with this shit. 
[01:00:00]  They're trying to make it too classy.  But fighting is different from a style.  No, I'm just, like, you're trying to ban style.  Right.  And, I mean, fighting is different.  I'm just throwing it all together.  It's like, you know.  You can't throw it all together, Opie.  You can't throw hockey in with style.  Like, fighting is different.  Well, this has just got my goat, as they say.  But if they scored a goal, if a hockey player scored a goal and then held his balls and lifted up his right skate and slid one, like, if the celebrations were like, yeah, baby, you know, and they skate a figure eight or do something, then there's something to, like, go off. 
[01:00:30]  Then they're going to get, no, no, what happens after that, they get the shit beat out of them.  But, not, well.  By who?  By the other team.  Actually, like, actually.  Wait, you score, you score a goal in hockey and you start, like, really, you know.  You do a victory dance.  You do, like, a victory dance.  There's a couple moves that the players do in general.  One skate with the arm pump.  Yeah, that type of stuff.  I've seen that one.  The shit you could do on PlayStation 2.  Yes, of course.  But if you do anything outside the moves that are kind of accepted, you're going to get your ass beat after scoring. 
[01:01:00]  Well, how come without a doubt?  Football players are not concerned about that.  Football players, they do the worm, they do the river dance.  And football is the most dangerous sport there is.  There's nothing but violent hitting.  So it's like.  Did somebody actually do the river dance?  Oh, Chad Johnson did the river dance.  Oh, yes, he did.  He did.  All right, that's fucking hysterical.  Chad Johnson did the river dance.  Isn't he the dude that's doing a new dance every time now or something like that?  He's trying, but he's running out.  He's running out of dances. 
[01:01:30]  He asked the fans to, like, please send me out.  That's funny as shit.  You haven't seen the video of him doing the river dance?  Oh, it's classic.  Oh, is that good?  It's really good.  It just should not be a dress code, man.  Especially when you've got a mark with a skill, man.  When you've got a skill that you can sell all over the world, NBA is the highest level of your skill, like, to sell it, the buyer.  Right.  But you could go to Europe.  You could go anywhere and sell your skill to the Globetrotters or whatever.  And you go, fuck, are you kidding?  Well, the whole league should get together and just dress however the fuck they want. 
[01:02:00]  I would do something.  And go against Stern.  But when you get Iverson going, you know, they should give me money for clothes.  I understand what he's saying.  It's not a money thing.  He's not going to get our sympathy, you know?  That's what he, see, that's the thing.  It's like, I, I.  And dunk it in the paper.  I found it really fast.  NBA code retarded.  It's, look, like, look, Allen and I, these dudes are not paid to be like, like you said, like we were talking about earlier, the spokesman for, it's really they're the president of themselves.  You know what I'm saying?  Right, right, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  And basically, it's like a stipend means, look, I spent all, half my money on these throwback jerseys, man.  I don't care if I got to get, take your hand out my pocket.  You understand?  Yeah.  It's like, I have to go, I'm, for me to dress.  See, this is what I'm saying.  If it was, like you said, white guy rules, they'd just go, okay, I'll go down over there.  You're talking like $250,000 worth of suits they're going to need to.  You're talking a lot of money to go get these things made, to take time out your day to go to do something, like you work for a fucking company at 9 to 5. 
[01:03:00]  Kiss my ass.  You're not going to get the fans on your side with that.  Who cares?  They make enough money.  So, you know, to us, it's like whatever.  Oh, but do you want anybody in your pockets, man, telling you what you're supposed to do with your money?  Exactly.  If XM Satellite Radio told us we have to come up here in a suit and tie every day and it comes out of our pocket.  With your money.  Exactly.  With your own money.  I would be pissed.  Well, Duncan says this about the dress code.  I think it's a load of crap. 
[01:03:30]  I understand what they're trying to do with the hats and do-rags and jerseys and stuff.  That's fine, but I don't understand why they would take it to this level.  I think it's basically retarded.  I don't like the direction they're going, but who am I?  Now, this guy is talking about the do-rags.  He's still qualifying.  See, what he's saying is like how he dresses.  He's just like a big Bahamian.  He's from the Bahamas or whatever, or the Virgin Islands or something.  So they walk around in linens and they dress retarded too.  But he's like saying, well, look, I don't want to dress in suits, but I can understand you getting rid of this hip-hoppy thing. 
[01:04:00]  You know what I mean?  But let them, I say, dress any goddamn way you want when you're worth a zillion dollars, man.  Has anybody tried racism yet about it?  Of course they have.  Because the league is black, but the white players are the worst dressed.  But the league is black.  The league is black, and the owners are white.  And the owners dress like bums.  And what's the game?  Mark Cuban from Dallas, he's like, man, kiss my ass.  I own the team.  I'm dressing. 
[01:04:30]  And then he goes, well, I don't approve of this thing.  And then he goes, well, don't your players have to?  He goes, yeah, they got to do it.  But gosh.  Mark Cuban's a really cool guy.  I fucking own the team.  I met that dude.  I was lucky to meet that guy.  He's a cool guy.  I like Mark Cuban.  He's like a real renegade.  And he's insane.  He's like a billionaire that's absolutely insane.  And he's just playing.  He bought a team because he could, and he's just playing.  That's all he's doing.  He's the, you know. 
[01:05:00]  Stop cleaning up our sports, though, in general.  I'm just making a general statement because the code thing got me thinking.  Stop.  Stop.  I say stop.  I don't know.  That's why the X Games and these other sports that are coming around, they're getting very popular  because people like to see the down and dirty shit.  The dirt.  Let me tell you something, man.  I like to see the dirt in my sport.  Are you a football fan?  I like to see the fights and everything.  Are you a football fan?  I like my Jets, but.  Look, football has become, like, the rules and the God and the Jesus. 
[01:05:30]  Like, when I played football when I was younger, if we hit somebody and he fell and he didn't  move and was paralyzed, we didn't hold the other team's hand and praise him.  We used to all hump in a circle over him and say, yeah, yeah, motherfucker.  You know, get up.  Look at his leg twitching.  He's paralyzed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come get your boy.  He's probably dead.  Like, that's what we did when we played football.  That's why I'm like, I'm like, steroids.  I'm so with you, man.  I want steroids.  Now after the games, they go into a pray circle. 
[01:06:00]  Some prayer.  We never would touch somebody and pray.  Pray.  If you believe in God and all that, great.  But all of a sudden, they get together, hold hands, and do a quick prayer at center field  or whatever sport it would be.  We used to pray somebody got paralyzed on the team.  Please, God.  Hope this.  Please let his vertebrae get snapped.  And the steroids thing is like, why do I care that Barry Bonds takes steroids?  Right.  I want to see him hit 800-foot home runs.  I don't want to see him. 
[01:06:30]  It makes it more exciting.  Yes.  And why are they playing?  So the people fucking watch to entertain the people.  What comedian, because I don't want to rip them off who has the joke about, you know,  they talk about steroids and stuff, but they don't go after the musicians who made some  of their greatest music on drugs.  On drugs, right.  But they did it on drugs.  Yeah.  They were performing on some kind of substance.  Well, I...  And they came out with their best shit.  When these rock guys, you know, clean up their act, that's when the shitty music comes  out.  Yeah.  And what if, like, some of my favorite Beatles music is off when they went on acid. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  The acid trip.  Yeah.  The strawberry feels.  And I like that trippy shit.  You know what I mean?  What are they going to say?  Musicians, no drugs.  We're going to be testing you.  If you come out positive for drugs, your album's getting pulled.  Well, I guess drugs help your creativity.  Yeah.  Without a doubt it does.  You know.  But I guess steroids will help.  If you don't take steroids and you're playing football against a dude that does.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  You'll get your head smushed in.  You're done.  You're done.  Anyway.  Anyway, to wrap up a little, I guess we're doing a little sports here.  You hear what XM Satellite Radio is doing?  The World Series starts, what, tomorrow night?  Indeed.  It's obviously Houston and Chicago going at it.  Who do you like?  It's pretty funny.  The New York paper here, the Daily News, the sports section on the cover, shows four  pitchers in the World Series that George Steinbrenner basically let go.  Yeah.  The Rocket, Andy Pettit. 
[01:08:00]  Who are the other two?  Yeah, El Duque and, yeah, Contreras.  All were Yankees at one time.  Yeah.  But anyway, XM Satellite Radio just announced this yesterday.  It's hitting all the papers in the press.  This is unbelievable.  XM Satellite Radio, which carries all Major League Baseball games, is giving away coupons  for free XM radios to everyone who attends Game 1 of the World Series at Chicago's U.S.  Cellular Park, Anthony.  If each of the 40,000 fans cashes in the coupon for the $80 Delphi Road XT, that's the new 
[01:08:30]  roadie, yeah.  That's a retail value of about $3.2 million.  XM will then do the same thing at Houston's Minute Maid Park if there is a Game 5.  That is a huge, huge giveaway.  They're saying it's like the biggest giveaway in World Series history.  XM on the ball once again.  What are they doing exactly?  They're giving away coupons for XM radios to everyone that enters the game, Game 1. 
[01:09:00]  To get like a free...  Yeah, and then you just go to a store and they, you know, you hand them the coupon and  they give you your XM radio.  And the World Series is live and well on XM.  This is a communique from Eric Logan.  ELO, Game 1, Saturday, 7.30 p.m., Houston.  And the White Sox going at it.  This is kind of cool.  XM 176 will have the White Sox feed.  And XM 183 will have the Astros feed.  Oh.  So you get the hometown announcers, depending on what team you're into. 
[01:09:30]  So, I want to see Houston win it.  You do?  Yeah, I want to see Clemens win it.  I used to hate Clemens.  Now I like the guy.  The White Sox.  Because he's getting up there.  Well, it would be cool.  I changed my tune because I did say White Sox earlier because they haven't won it since,  what, 1917 or something?  I think I'd rather see the White Sox.  Yeah, I root for people.  I mean, he's got to give them a break.  Even though that team is the sucky Chicago team.  Yeah.  That's the one that doesn't...  It's not going to make it...  I just like it because they beat the Angels.  That's the only reason. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  They beat the Angels.  That's it.  So, that's the team I'm going for.  All right.  Because they japped the Yankees out of...  This started with me going to the hockey game last night.  I've got to just give you an update.  I went to our restaurant last night.  I bought a restaurant with my brothers.  That's right.  I'm a silent part.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Here in Boston, right?  On Long Island.  On Long Island.  In Huntington.  And I went to see the progress of the construction.  Uh-oh.  Was everybody like, oh, the boss is showing up.  Look out.  Here he comes. 
[01:10:30]  A couple things.  My brother found out that the guy upstairs from him has been tapping into electricity for years.  He discovered it because he has an electrician, you know, working on some shit, right?  And the guy's like, uh, the guy is tapping into your electricity.  Guy's just been stealing power.  Somewhere along the line when the restaurant was closed, this guy had access to the basement and he plugged into our electricity.  I guess I could say our, our electricity.  That's great.  And has been rocking and rolling, you know, free for a while. 
[01:11:00]  So my brother, he's just like me, right?  He turns off the circuit breakers, shutting off all power to the restaurant, which in turn will shut off power to his stupid apartment upstairs.  And then my brother just sits in the dark with a flashlight waiting for him to come down.  Just like me, just a psychopath, just waiting.  And sure enough, you hear the guy that my brother tells the story, coming down the stairs all pissed off, walks into the restaurant.  My brother turns the flashlight on right in his eyes and basically says, hello, motherfucker. 
[01:11:30]  Hey, what are you doing?  We've got some things to talk about.  And then it turns out, and this is why I'm talking about this today, this guy is friends.  You're going to die when you hear this one.  Why?  With Bernie Getz.  The Bernie Getz.  Subway gunman.  The Bernie Getz that will not come back on our show because of what we did to him.  And he's been known to be in this exact restaurant that we bought.  Because his friend lives right upstairs.  I guess he does B-movies with this guy or something.  B-movies. 
[01:12:00]  You know those stupid B-movies that no one watches, huh?  Jesus, y'all got into some creepy shit, man.  Yeah, what the hell, man?  That's creepy, dude.  That kind of shit scares me.  Why?  It's like ominous kind of weird shit.  Because the guy brought down, I guess he found out that, I don't know, I'm part of this whole thing with the restaurant.  So he brought down like Bernie Getz articles and left it on the bar.  Uh-oh.  Because he has access to the restaurant, which pretty much ended yesterday.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  So he came down and he was like, who the hell? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Who the hell turned off my electricity that I've been stealing?  Yeah, he just thought the circuit breaker went.  And he's been down the basement a million times.  So he just went down to pop the circuit breakers back on.  And there's my brother.  No way, motherfucker.  It scared the shit out of him.  So what did the guy say?  Did he say, hey, I'm sorry, I'm stealing electricity?  No, then this guy did the stupidest thing he could do to a Hughes and raised his voice.  And that's when a switch goes off in our heads.  We just don't listen anymore.  And then we get right back in your face and let you have it. 
[01:13:00]  Did this guy have a bunch of squirrels running around jerking them off like Bernie does?  Yeah.  Bernie and his squirrels.  Lunatic.  We grew up with a lot of yelling and screaming in our household, Patrice.  That's a story that goes back.  Don't worry about it.  People are laughing out there.  Ah, that sounds like a friend of mine.  What?  William Burr.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Bill's told us some really funny parents.  I grew up with some screaming from the mom.  Who's kidding?  So when that happens to us now in our adult lives, you ain't getting anything done. 
[01:13:30]  You just cut.  I don't even listen.  You just yell at people.  I don't listen.  I just shut off if you yell at me.  I just shut off.  Which is kind of strange because I'm the biggest yeller around here, but I guess I got my mom.  That's weird.  Who yelled more in your house?  No, my mom.  Oh, see?  Now, my father was a yeller.  So when I hear, like, yelling, I kind of, like, just cower and get, like, oh, stop it.  Stop it.  Like, yelling annoys the piss out of me.  I get, like, this.  I get the douche chills.  Unless it's coming from, like, an apartment next door or something.  I love when you hear, 
[01:14:00]  I run for the glass.  And I put the glass against the wall, and I'm listening.  I love a good next door argument.  Love it.  Yeah.  I get all pissed.  I try to find, like, a closet that gets a better sound than that.  Yeah.  Wandering around.  Love knowing what's going on.  By the way, there's a lot of fans in Long Island.  My brother's working his balls off.  If you want to stop by with a pickup truck and haul some shit away.  Because people have been asking what they can do to help.  Oh, boy. 
[01:14:30]  I don't know.  He'll probably give you a gift certificate or, I don't know, something.  What are you guys going to sell?  What kind of food?  Some kind of food.  It's all my brother.  American something.  Is he cooking?  We're not going to town.  He's not a cook.  American bistro.  He's a great cook, actually.  He's been in the business as long as I've been doing radio.  He's really good.  So, if you're in the Huntington area, my brother's at 400 New York Avenue.  400 New York Avenue.  Stop by and say hi.  Either today or sometime this weekend.  And if you want to lend a hand, he's looking for some able bodies. 
[01:15:00]  We were hoping for, like, November 1st, but I don't think that's happening.  And you guys Irish, right?  No, everyone thinks that.  You're not Irish, right?  I'm a mutt.  Oh, just a bunch of European.  Just a white guy.  The most, I'm a quarter Polish.  I'm a quarter Polish.  Quarter Polish is the most, and then everything else is just all over the ball field.  Some German and a tiny, tiny, tiny bit of Irish, but nothing real significant.  You don't want to admit to the Polish.  Why not?  He's admitting to being black.  You got no choice.  You can fake it. 
[01:15:30]  Whitey can fake it.  That's what I'm saying.  It can always just be something.  I hope he can go 100% German, you know?  And everyone would go, oh, hey, German.  Yeah, yeah.  Or, oh, he's Irish.  Oh, Irish.  Doesn't matter.  And look at it.  And he's from, like, this mutt thing, and it's like, you know, white, just to, that's  what I love about white and black people.  We just pick the color.  And it's like, we just arguing on that color level.  But it's like, he has nothing to do with slavery.  He's a goddamn Polack.  Yeah.  And he's like, let me tell you something.  Well, my people owned your people.  They didn't have any fucking Polish. 
[01:16:00]  Dude, every race was enslaved.  Just about.  That's what it was about.  Polish.  Well, the Poles had a little problem back there in the World War II.  Polish Jews.  That's right.  That's right, my brother.  A little difficulty.  I lost some peeps.  Give us the fist in the air.  The Jews had a problem under Ramsey's.  That was a little bit of a debacle, if you could call it that.  Yeah.  Oh, get over it.  What are you, Jews?  Get over it.  Get over it.  You had nothing to do with it.  What are you going to get over that whole Moses thing?  Come on, let it go. 
[01:16:30]  Come on.  The real battle was my grandpappy and your grandpappy.  Pappy.  Pappy.  We had nothing to do with this.  It was our grandpappies that really hate each other.  Let's calm the fuck down.  Hey, on the way to the Islander game, just to wrap this whole dumb break up, I took my  brothers to the game and I was talking to them about Baby Diaz.  Right.  Ronnie told them.  Ronnie told an unbelievable story about Baby Diaz.  Of course, Ron and Fez are on after us at 11 a.m. here on the East Coast. 
[01:17:00]  Hysterical program.  And I retold the whole Baby Diaz thing and they were laughing really hard because it was  something that I found extremely, extremely funny.  Ronnie, real quick, yesterday, I guess right at the end of their show, had a take on something  that I had never heard before.  Some guy called up to bash their show.  Right.  Calls up and goes, you know, I listen to O&A every day and they rule, said something like  that and I can't see why they gave you guys a golden ticket because I listened and you 
[01:17:30]  guys suck so fucking bad.  And Ronnie just unloads on them and goes, well, you know something, you know something about  your heroes, you know something about your heroes, we're friends with them.  You worship them.  We hang out with them.  So how about that?  And just like shut the guy up.  It was a tack that I had never heard before.  You like O&A?  You're like, yeah, yeah.  Well, they're our friends.  We hang with them. 
[01:18:00]  You worship them.  We're their friends.  And they're doing quite well.  Of course they are.  They've got their own audience.  They're doing their own thing.  We share a huge audience and then they've got their people that like them better than  us.  So that's just how it works.  You go to the message boards and there are people that are like, you know, I love O&A,  but I can't stand Ron and Fez and then you've got the other people that love Ron and Fez  can't stand this show.  But for some reason, the people that get bashed the most are the people that can really just  sit down and enjoy both shows and the differences. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  Like they had a whole thing on the differences between O&A and Ron and Fez.  And instead of just talking about the differences, it's like, well, O&A suck because they don't  do this or Ron and Fez blow because they don't do this.  Not just looking that the two shows are completely different, which is a great thing.  If you have two shows on the same channel, you don't want the same fucking show twice.  I find Ron and Fez hysterical.  I listen on the way home.  Hysterical.  Different than us?  Of course.  Very different.  That's why we like them. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  All right.  And they're on right after us at 11.  But I was telling the Baby DS thing in the car on the way to the Coliseum last night  getting huge laughs.  But I told my brothers I can't do the story justice.  So I'm playing it here.  We haven't played this in a while.  So we'll play this.  And then Drew Boogie, who's spinning for us because it's the day before vacation, will  spin us out of here for a little while.  When we get back, we got Stalker Patty with part two of her book report.  We got Big A that's going to do...  She brings chocolate?  Yep. 
[01:19:30]  She brought chocolate, it looks like.  And Big A's going to be doing the best of Leno and Letterman's monologues from the  week.  Were you here last week when he did it?  No.  He started doing it, and it was really funny, and then we ran out of show.  We ran out of time.  So we're going to try to get him on next.  Did you hear this one, people?  You've got to hear him do stand-up.  He's a wreck.  He really is a wreck.  Here's Baby Diaz.  Baby Anthony Harris.  Always, especially in the music radio, people want to call up and request songs for the 
[01:20:00]  dead.  Sure.  That is the most depressing thing you're trying to do.  Remember at AAF, trying to do a high-energy rock show?  What's the famous one?  People would be like, dude, my father died yesterday, and I'm just really depressed.  Thanks a lot.  I feel bad for you and all, but Jesus, how are we supposed to do a show?  Yeah.  It always comes back to, there's terrible problems, but if you can just get on some Ozzy, 
[01:20:30]  mom, mom, I'm coming home.  It's always mom, mom, I'm coming home.  This is a big one for them, you know?  You're like, I'm trying to make it through a show here.  Dickets will really cover a lot.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, we did do that show in Tampa, and we would get really red, red, red callers that  would, you know, be calling in from the middle of the state.  And this one day, this guy calls in.  Is it an Indian communist?  No, redneck.  Oh, okay. 
[01:21:00]  And his redneck is a reference.  Yeah.  I mean, pretty much the people that you see that are homeless right now on TV, they could  all move over there and do well for themselves.  Within a week, you could take over.  Or just some of the dumbest white people in the country.  But in a nice way.  They would love the rock stations.  So this guy calls up, and he's like, saying to my partner at the time, we love you, God.  We keep rocking.  Because we would be playing rock music, too, you know?  And he goes, we just had a little baby, and we named him Diaz.  You know what I mean?  It's like a Spanish name you're giving to a little white kid. 
[01:21:30]  And so he's like, hey, please don't do that.  So I'm really uncomfortable having a kid named Effie.  Well, the following day, or two days later, we get a call, Diaz is in trouble.  Oh, now you're involved.  Yeah, now we're involved.  His little godparents.  His little kidneys aren't working.  And he just can't seem to flush himself.  And, you know, my partner is just completely freaked out. 
[01:22:00]  And then we're always into, so if you could get free bird on.  You know what I mean?  We'll just keep him.  He's a rocker.  He's going to rock through this.  He's a little rocker.  The following day, you know, of course, at 8.17 this morning, baby Diaz was taken from us.  You know, he's in tears at this point.  Now, somebody he's never met, he's lost his little namesake.  And he's going, are you behind us, man?  No, I'm going, no. 
[01:22:30]  I wish I would have thought of an idea like this, but your namesake is dead.  Two days later, we gave away his heart, brain, and skin tissue so all their babies.  It just would never end.  The funeral will be at 3.15 if you guys can get out there.  And maybe if you can get us some of them David Lee Roth tickets, it might take our mind off it.  In lieu of flowers.  They always think backstage is going to solve any problem that they have. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, man.  Two weeks, they put this poor guy through this.  Wow.  You knew the baby was doomed before anything went wrong.  First of all, I consider the baby lucky to die in that family.  That was the blessing.  Could have went on.  Could have went on.  Maybe those people are so poor. 
[01:23:30]  Some of the people who do that, they're so poor.  They've never touched anything in their life.  Let them touch those things for once.  All together now.  And we'll be the babynekers.  Hey!  Let them touch those things.  Let them touch those things.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't stick it.  Chinese for once.  Take a kayak.  Take a kayak.  Take a kayak  Take a kayak

[01:32:30]  uh we were honest because we were big wrestling guys i'm not watching as much and i don't know  what they're going to be able to do to to get someone like me back uh you know checking it  out again i think i think it went way too pc and that really just took the whole edge out of the  thing well you saw the arab dude did you see that oh man after uh they really played the arab dude  he came out with the uh with the beheading guys that yeah yeah he headed the undertaker all right  i didn't see that oh my like right after the london bombings i think uh that that happened but it was 
[01:33:00]  already in the can it was already taped yeah but you know why he's a star like he's going to be a  star he's a star and jericho's going to be a star here's the thing because they have regular bodies  like they they have athletic muscles and like a guy like batista cannot be a celebrity so it's only  going to be a few regular shape guys that could be a star you can't make you know like uh schnitzky  or whatever you can't make him a star because he's just too enormous so he'll always be like a 
[01:33:30]  background bodyguard there's no real uh huge action action here well you laugh you laugh but our buddy  patrice o'neal uh should introduce you rock he uh that's his role in all movies yeah i'm i'm and i don't  even have muscles it's just that i can act like evidently you got to be be able to act to be a  background bodyguard too so you just you can't just you know what i mean but except for uh kevin  nash kevin nash is uh uh they see sneaking in movies yeah yeah patrice knowing all the wrestling 
[01:34:00]  crap we only have a few minutes with the rock because he's now a big star there were there was  there were the days when he'd come and hang for hours now it's like hanging out drinking yeah now  they're telling us oh you only got seven minutes with the rock he's way too busy  are you doing the whole circuit today talking to a million radio stations and tv stations i got a  two-hour tour uh the two-hour gimmick tour yeah every seven minutes you got to make believe that  you're the you're fans of that particular show you know the guys really well you guys are doing great  brilliant show give it up the rocks got the movie doom coming out today doom uh yeah you ever play the 
[01:34:30]  game yeah i was a big fan of the game well first of all i i thought it was the first time i played  it came out i think in like 90 or 91 yeah and uh my buddy was like dude you got to play doom i was  like all right we'll get together i thought it was on sega because back then we're all playing sega  playstation they're like no it's on the computer i was like well fuck i don't even know how to turn  a computer on so that i had after that i started playing it it's cool man yeah that's a game that's  evolved um from just you know uh what was it like flat brick walls and you're kind of going around 
[01:35:00]  corners and shooting stuff and now uh the game though the last one that came out just looks  amazing and uh great storyline really creepy how does that uh translate into the movie uh very well  we kept very very loyal to the video game and you know it's that unapologetic approach that the video  game had with its blood and its gut and its and its gore and that's what we did that's great because i  like i like the scary shit in those games like uh you're walking around the music's the area you come 
[01:35:30]  around the corner and boom there's something there that uh just scares the shit out of you  that's exactly what you get in the movie that's great and you you get to work with some of those  fun unique weapons oh yeah of course like it like the bfg yeah the big fucking gun big fucking gun  that's the bfg and uh the chainsaw uh chainsaw's in there pinky demon's in there the baron the imp  every everybody's in there one thing i really like from the trailer i saw was uh the fact that they  kind of incorporate that first person shooter view in on a few of your kills oh yeah yeah i mean 
[01:36:00]  that that that's that's a scene that's just it blows you blows your way yeah it's awesome it's  awesome yeah you get to see him go at uh one of those creatures with a chainsaw it's pretty nice  it's exactly what doom should be yeah made into a movie yeah you're going to hell and everything  that whole hell uh the portal yeah all that stuff and all the demons are from hell hey al rock at this  point do you have just scripts piled up all the way to the ceiling i got a lot man you know we

[01:38:30]  everything um i just want to do it quietly i never wanted to say you know i'm retired to make a big deal  about it because everybody who retires you know you see him like two two weeks later yeah so i just  didn't want to be that guy i just wanted to thank everybody i thank the old man i thank everybody in  the back and yeah obviously though you still have some kind of relationship with him because of that  name yeah he must be loving the fact that uh a check gets sent over to him every time you use the rock  no no not necessarily what happens is we we have a dual ownership so what he could do he could still 
[01:39:00]  make the dolls the wrestling dolls the t-shirts and stuff like that he doesn't get a piece of your  movie though no oh wow that's nice you had a good deal uh the best so if you went to dwayne johnson  would that be like a dick move if you did that no uh no it wouldn't be a dick move i mean he'd  understand it but when he what's happened now it's kind of naturally taken uh a life of its own on  where everybody just refers to me as dwayne rock johnson yeah you know what i mean did he beg you to like  retire like just like let kane give you one last something from hell never see just like the death 
[01:39:30]  of the rock throw you off a building and you just never see it again i'm sure no one thinks he wanted  the big ending you know he lights on fire and drops you from the top of the arena no he was he was cool  man he uh and plus you know i just i did the business the right way it's like okay you need me to put  anybody over who yeah it doesn't matter whether it's brock lesnar when i leave it's like whoever 
[01:40:00]  yeah so uh so you're officially saying you're done with wrestling huh um all it took was one of those  hollywood paychecks to come rolling yeah but he put the arab dude over didn't he put the arab dude over  didn't he um a little bit uh the one with delo no the arab no not delo he's indian the other the new  guy that got banned see i don't know i don't know the characters that that much muhammad didn't you come  back and put him over or something no on raw one day no oh mohammad was in my mind no no all right

How you doing, Creepy?  It's like, yeah.  Like the little retarder of Laverna Shirley.  You just go, you just go, guys.  You're like, hey, yeah, how you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  Let me go to the phone real fast, because who the fuck might have something on Patty owing money? 
[01:50:00]  Oh.  Who the fuck?  What's up?  Who the fuck?  Hey, I'm thinking, you know, Patty's got trouble with the bank my ass if she's gambling junkets to Atlantic City.  Yep.  I don't go there that much.  Only once and twice.  Every month or so.  Oh, that's twice a month.  How much money to Patty Jordan to Patty Jordan?  Just to take a nice ride, and only really during the summer, because the beach is there and it's nice. 
[01:50:30]  I don't do anything during the winter.  Patty, Patty, let's really discuss this, because I think you might have a gambling problem.  If you're gambling at all, and you're $1,000 in debt, that's a problem.  You should not be gambling.  I don't really do that much.  I go to the beach.  Not even that much.  No, no.  Not that much.  That is what you use as a disposable income for, gambling.  Not money that you need to pay bills.  How much do you blow in Atlantic City that you could have paid that $1,000 bill? 
[01:51:00]  How much?  I only bring about $30 or $40 with me.  Each time?  And I go once every couple months or something to take a bus ride down there and walk along  the beach, you know, and stuff.  She's fetish sexy, though.  Like, it's something creepily sexy.  I don't know.  Can you dress her up or something?  There would be some creep that would really get off on a girl like Patty.  She's got some weird sex appeal.  It's just creepy.  It's really creepy.  Like necrophilia.  You know why?  What's necrophilia again? 
[01:51:30]  I don't remember what that means.  Dead bodies.  But you're sexy for a dead body.  That's fucking dead.  You could smell the virgin in her.  That's why.  Oh, is that what it is?  50, never been fucked.  You never had sex before, Bubba?  Nope.  No, I'm a virgin.  You've got to use those little teeth for something.  It's like you give the bed a head.  Have you ever given a head?  No.  Never given head?  No.  She barely kissed the guy.  She'd never give a hand job, nothing.  She plays a little bit with herself.  You masturbate. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, my goodness.  Do you shave?  I'm innocent.  What can I tell you?  Do you shave it?  Do you keep it pretty just in case?  Yeah, for hygiene reasons.  Hygiene.  Hygienic reasons.  You shave it completely?  Well, yeah, for hygienic reasons.  That's like polishing a car with no engine.  Yeah.  That's exactly what she does.  An old classic, a Packard.  It's like 50 years old, never been driven.  At the end, with the forearm, and then go...  You give it one last... 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, that's my girl.  Never drove her.  Zero miles.  Yes, I am.  Have you done...  What's the dirtiest thing?  The only reason why I'm one is because...  I don't know.  Safety, maybe?  I don't want diseases and AIDS.  Safety.  But you're 50 years old.  There weren't diseases.  And I want to save that for someone I love.  Age is not so bad.  Patrice, religion got to her.  Yep.  Catholic.  Well, when I was young, about 20 years ago, 30 years ago.  And we can't get it out of her fucking skull.  Have you ever had orgasm? 
[01:53:00]  No.  Not even by mistake?  No, she has.  You once talked about it on the show.  Yeah, but it's embarrassing.  See, everything's embarrassing.  Sex is dirty.  It's not dirty.  It's just something, you know...  Do you dream about being taken?  Taken?  What do you mean having...  Like someone having sex with you and it's not your fault.  Like, taken against your will.  A couple of dreams I've had, but only before that time of the month. 
[01:53:30]  What's the dream like?  You left the door open, the window?  What happens?  No, I wake up and...  Well, I see this tulip coming up and then opening up.  And I wake up and I have the feelings.  And I'm like, oh, okay.  The feelings.  Does the tulip open up and go, you know what?  Never mind.  I'm just going to get out of here.  The tulip opens up.  The tulip said, look, I had too much to drink.  Never mind, bitch.  The tulip doesn't say anything. 
[01:54:00]  She can't even have...  She's got to have these vague, like, symbolism dreams.  It can't just be a fat cock coming at her.  It's got to be a beautiful tulip.  Actually, I dreamed of having sex with the edge.  The edge from you, too?  Yeah, because that's my celebrity crush.  Would you give it up to anybody?  Like, who would you just say, you know what?  I'm losing my virginity right now.  Somebody I love.  Somebody you would just say, fuck it.  I'm popping them.  No, not a stranger.  No, I'm just saying, like a guy like Edge. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, well, if I go out with the person long enough, maybe after about six months, then you have that.  Patty, you're not 18.  You have no time rules.  You've got to give it up quick.  Oh, I read a couple chapters in this book where there were 70-year-olds doing it, and with guys so much younger, and they were more fulfilled at their age than a 25-year-old.  That's 70.  Bullshit.  And it wasn't a 70-year-old virgin.  Well, this one was a dancer, and she was 71 and looked 45. 
[01:55:00]  That looks like something like me.  That doesn't make her look better.  It's like, hey, she's 112.  She looks 82.  Yeah.  She looks 45.  It's still a mess.  Got them lips hanging down.  And you're 50?  Yeah, do I look it?  You know you don't.  Maybe.  No.  She doesn't look 50.  No, she doesn't.  You've got to give her that.  Because I take care of myself.  Put some mileage on you.  I'm only 18.  Times what?  Oh, hey!  That's a good one.  So you wear sexy undergarments? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, sometimes I do.  I would like to...  I bet you pull your drawers way up to your titties.  No, I don't.  I bet you have giant drawers.  No, I don't.  Let me see just at the top.  What are your panties like?  Show the top.  Show the top.  I have old-fashioned cotton ones on.  Let's see, Patty.  Just show your panties.  Show the top.  Let's see how bad these look.  All right.  Look, right here.  Just unbutton that.  Oh, a flat stomach?  That's it.  Wait a minute. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, pull your pants down.  Jesus Christ.  Look how loose they are.  Patty.  Shaved and...  I know.  Patty, pull your pants down.  You've shown us everything by this point.  Just show your panties.  Jesus.  Let me see the panties.  We don't want to see your crotch today.  Good.  See the panties.  All right.  There's her panties.  And pull your shirt up a little bit.  Sparkle?  Let me see the booty.  Let me just see the booty.  It's not bad.  Good God!  Why is there somebody popping panties?  She does.  That's a 50-year-old ass.  At least I don't have to worry about finding a boyfriend, I guess.  I don't know.  Well, Jimmy thinks she has a nice ass. 
[01:56:30]  Dude, she got a little pumpkin.  For 50 years old.  Take care of yourself and eat a vegetarian diet and you don't take drugs and you don't  smell.  So you just don't do anything that I do.  Just lay there.  But you've been doing that for 50 years.  And you do a lot of walking and exercising.  I work out two times a week in my building.  Jesus.  You have a weight room there.  I've got to hear about her having sex.  Well, no.  Her cherry is like rawhide.  You'd have to take a Sawzall to that shit to get five fucking years, six years. 
[01:57:00]  How long have we known her?  Oh, God.  And we've been trying every time to get her laid.  She made cookies for us one day and she's been around ever since.  Ain't happening.  Has someone ever gave you a head?  No.  No one went down on you ever?  No one went down on you?  She hasn't done anything.  That would be a good life breaker for her.  I'm innocent.  Patty hasn't even, like, French kissed.  That little pants pull down thing, I thought I was going to be horrified, but it's like  a fetish movie, like Dumb Housewives, you know, Dumb Housewives. 
[01:57:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, she's like a housewife, like some filthy housewife's husband goes over, goes working.  She's home just doing fucked up shit.  Pool boy.  Yeah, it's weird.  Yeah.  Good God.  The closest she got to having sex was she wanted to see U2.  We had U2 tickets and Ron Jeremy was in.  So we had Ron Jeremy hide the U2 tickets under his ball sack.  She had to reach in and get them.  So she had to flop his dick around and balls around a little bit to get him out. 
[01:58:00]  It was kind of hard to do that.  And then we had another pair that we gave her that Ron Jeremy's in.  We put them down her pants and Ron Jeremy had to grab them and he diddled her a little bit.  Oh, how was that?  It was weird.  And very strange.  Now, if you could cut off the weirdness and substitute it.  Like, did you ever have a sexual feeling that wasn't attached to being weird?  Like, did you ever just let it go and go, oh, that felt kind of good?  Good question. 
[01:58:30]  Well, what's that?  That's a question that he just asked.  Well, I don't know.  At night when I'm sleeping, it can be relaxing.  It can be relaxing.  There's no way somebody can't talk their way into messy drawers.  I don't know.  Maybe it's a chlorophyll.  This is what we need to do with Patty.  It's so obvious now.  We need to get a hypnotist.  And hypnotize them.  There's so many people that want to hypnotize you and I.  And lie to all that shit.  We don't go there, right? 
[01:59:00]  Because it's all bullshit.  They come in here.  They hypnotize people.  Put on their little show.  And it's a bullshit thing.  No, a real hypnotist.  Like a guy that takes it very seriously and gets shit done.  Uh-huh.  You're still skeptical.  That's okay.  But, you know, put her under and see if we can bring her back into her child.  I'm telling you, we'd find some weird shit out.  I'm telling you.  Was you touch funny, you think?  What?  Was you touch funny?  When you were growing up, were you ever touched as a child?  Not that I remember. 
[01:59:30]  Uh-oh.  See?  Damn it.  See, here's our background real quick.  She was born of a woman of questionable morality and a stockbroker guy.  The woman of questionable...  Oh, a trick.  She was a trick.  Could have been.  Yeah.  Trick baby.  Yeah.  She's born.  She's an infant.  The mother brings her as an infant in a little basket into a diner, puts her on the counter,  and fucking leaves.  So now Patty gets brought to the New York foundling center like one of the little rascals.  One of those things she got touched. 
[02:00:00]  I had a girlfriend that went to her when she was a kid.  Yeah, she got touched funny by the security.  Like, remember that movie where Kevin Bacon was the...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was that Rounders, maybe?  No, that was the poker one.  That was the one where Brad Pitt's in that.  Brad Pitt, they play the gangsters, and Brad Pitt's the lawyer.  Yeah, and when they're kids, they get sent to jail and all get fucked.  That's who got her is a security guard, somebody at the place that she went in.  It's very simple.  And she blocked that out.  So she grows up.  She grows up in the foundling center and foster homes. 
[02:00:30]  And then she gets put with her foster parents at what age?  I was almost two.  Almost two.  And they are like Methuselah.  They're ancient people.  If Patty's mom was alive today, she'd be over 100.  Over 100 years old.  Yeah, my foster mother was born in 06.  Oh, my foster father was born in 06.  Oh, my foster father was born in 03.  So they're highly, they're real religious Catholics, and they raise her and just beat her with  the Bible and the sex is bad, and she grew up in this atmosphere, abandoned by her mother, 
[02:01:00]  grows up, foster home, elderly couple raising her, strict Catholic.  Mother's a hooker, raised by fucking Moses.  It's a fucking lifetime movie.  I don't know that she was a hooker.  I know she worked in a so-called burlesque club, whatever they called them in those days.  Whatever you want to call her.  May have been like a Play-Doh's retreat, for all I know.  Yeah.  Well, Play-Doh's retreat.  That was a stripper's name.  Yeah, she had a stripper.  Come on, everybody.  Play-Doh's retreat.  Bring her up.  Bring her up.  Bring her up. 
[02:01:30]  What music they used for strippers back then.  It's Play-Doh's retreat, everybody.  Don't forget to tip your maitre d's.  Mr. and Mrs. North American, all the sympathy.  Flash.  There's a hooker coming.  And remember, loose lips sing ships.  Let's bring up our next act.  Oh, look at Longwood.  Don't worry about it, baby. 
[02:02:00]  I had problems, too.  I don't know about that.  Because it looks like she really wants to have fun, sexually and fun.  But there's still something just blocking her from just going for it.  That booty, and she enjoyed how much sexual, like, she enjoyed somebody going, she was all nervous.  And then she's like, wow, somebody likes that little booty.  She's happy when people look.  And then she goes, I take care of myself.  And she's very proud like that.  But when it comes to sex, boom, the breaker switch, slam, goes right off.  If you're a real hypnotist, get a hold of Ben so we can get this done.  And we're looking for the real deal. 
[02:02:30]  Come on, Patrice.  You're smooth.  You can break that in.  And we'll see what we can get done with Patty.  I know.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I know that, like, I could talk Patty into doing something.  Yeah?  I'm just genius like that.  That's smooth?  Not now, but just, hey, Patty, you know, let me, come on, let me.  A little calmo.  Just a little calmo.  Yeah, man.  You would need, the first thing that has to happen to her is for her to receive oral sex.  Yes, she has to get head.  That's the first thing on the list because that leaves no responsibility to you. 
[02:03:00]  You're not putting your mouth or anything dirty.  And it's purely your pleasure.  And we've got a guy that's willing to do it.  Oh.  And he'll give you $1,000, the $1,000 you need.  The $1,000 you need to pay your bills so the loan shark doesn't get you.  Big Al, the trucker.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  You're willing to go down on Patty for $1,000?  Yeah, yeah.  Patty.  I'll do it.  Dude, she looks good, man.  What do you think?  He'll give you $1,000 if he can go down on you. 
[02:03:30]  Come on, Patty.  Do you know what go down on you means?  Yeah.  Have you ever turned it down, Patty?  Have you ever been offered?  No, she makes sure she's not even in the situation.  Yeah, she has stayed out of that situation for 50 years.  Well, yeah.  It's 35.  You would have to hypnotize me that I go under, that I'm not even aware that it's happening.  What are you talking like, like drugs?  Has she showed you her?  Her, her.  Oh, we've seen it.  We've seen everything.  And she just never let anybody that was willing to just take a little finger rub down and 
[02:04:00]  just do this to the...  We did put a remote control vibrator.  Vibrator.  Light on her.  It doesn't do too much, though.  Wait, do we have that?  Oh, you have to go to work today, right?  Yeah, I have to open the store.  Well, are you late now?  Well, I've got to be there by 9.30.  Well, it's 9.12.  Yeah.  I guess we're not going to do the book report.  You're going to have to come back and do that.  I sure will.  I'll bring some stuff.  I'll bring some goddamn truffles.  No problem, Anthony.  I promise you. 
[02:04:30]  Really fast.  Christy, I'm sorry to make you wait.  That's okay.  Have you been listening to this crazy conversation?  I have, and I will say it's crazy.  Oh, you're into it?  No.  Why not?  Uh-uh.  This is Christy who got kicked off The Apprentice last night.  Yeah, well, Patty, we've known Patty for many years, so we can talk openly like this  with her.  I'm glad you guys have that relationship.  Are you in shock by the talk?  No, not by the talk.  No.  What are you shocked by?  The cursing?  No, not even the cursing.  Nothing. 
[02:05:00]  She's just corporate.  She just has to say that stuff.  You're very corporate.  Yeah, that's her rules.  Oh, this is shocking, but she got...  Behind closed doors, you're probably wild, just like everybody, but you have this image  that you have to portray out of her.  She's a little corporate cho-cho's moving, because she's...  We understand.  Corporate women are always dirty, because they have to be phony all day long, and...  Hey, I'm not phony.  No.  I think you've watched by the show, and I'm far from phony.  She's far from phony, Patrice.  Did you watch The Apprentice?  I've seen it once in my life with that horrible hair that Don...  What is his name?  Donald Trump.  That dumb hair. 
[02:05:30]  You know what?  He loves that you're at least talking about him.  That you even mentioned his hair.  He loves it.  Yeah.  Oh, we understand that.  We understand what he's all about.  I didn't see it.  She's sexy, this one of you?  Uh, yeah, she's very cute.  Very cute.  And, uh, you got fired last night.  I'm trying to remember what the deal was.  You guys had to, uh, construct a float or something?  We did.  And, uh, to promote a new movie called, what, Zathra?  That's what Jen M called it, but it's really Sathora.  Sathora?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Sathora.  So, why did you get kicked off last night, in your opinion? 
[02:06:00]  Um...  I think I definitely come across very strong-willed, strong-minded,  I definitely voiced my opinions.  But isn't that good?  You know, it is a good thing.  It's worked for me this far, and, excuse me, and I'm not going to change anything.  So, um, it was a shock for me.  When I was fired, it was a total shock.  And to have someone else say that I personally don't think should have stayed, um, I definitely 
[02:06:30]  think I'm better than Jen M.  Um, that, that was, that was tough.  Yeah.  But she's still there, and you're, uh...  And I'm not.  And you're gone.  You had to take the lonely cab ride home.  There you go.  She looks icy.  She looks focused.  I'm looking at you.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, Patrice is taking a look at your picture, and he says you look very icy, very focused.  Yeah, she got something.  She got something to prove.  I like her.  You got that cold stare with those.  You got blue eyes, right?  I do, and I smile most of the time, but when it's time to put that game face on, you have 
[02:07:00]  to.  Yeah.  The thing about it, no one's scared.  They only scare you.  There's women like this when they go in the corporate world.  They just, they act all, but I would just like to catch her in a bar where that, like  that corporate shit doesn't work, where she goes, and I go, listen, white woman.  You know, even in corporate, though, my personality is, I am just who I am.  I'm the same person, but I'm a very straight shooter.  I'm not going to sugarcoat things for you.  I mean, I'm a take it or leave it kind of person.  Yeah.  Are you married?  I am engaged. 
[02:07:30]  Getting married November 12th.  Yeah, congratulations to you.  Thank you.  You got kids?  I do.  I have an eight-year-old.  Eight-year-old.  Oh, second marriage for you, then.  No, no.  It was, um, I had her when I was 16.  Wow.  Your baby's mother?  Oh, delicious.  Is your fiancee black?  No, he's not.  You had a kid at 16?  I did.  You had the kid at 16, so you got pregnant at 15?  No, um, I had her two months before I turned 17.  Oh, wow.  She's a real redneck. 
[02:08:00]  I like that.  16, was it like the first time?  That was harsh.  Yeah, you're a real, only white girls that have babies are the way like a rednecks.  No, that's not necessarily true.  I just chose to keep mine.  Yeah.  I was the one that got caught, and I chose to keep my child and turn it into something  really good.  What happened that you were, um, having sex at 16, though?  Um, you know, I had, um, you know, let's not talk about that.  I'd really rather not talk about that.  Yeah, but we would.  I kind of overcame it.  What are you going to do, run, run, and tell the boss? 
[02:08:30]  I don't, I don't need details or anything like that.  I'm just saying, is there.  Honestly, I think it's a matter of when you're dating someone, and, um, this guy was, you  know, four years older than me, and he was an athlete, and it was just that whole experience  that you go through.  And I wish, obviously, I would have said no, and I would tell the girls out there now to  say no, and...  Don't do that.  Yeah.  I would.  I would.  They, um, we, no, that's understandable. 
[02:09:00]  I mean...  But it turned out to be something so good for me, because she is what drove me to my success.  Yeah, you see the guy anymore, or is he involved in your life?  Um, he doesn't live around here, he's actually in, um, he's actually in Iraq, and been there  for a while, fighting the war, and we have a good relationship, and when he comes into  town, he sees her, and, um, he appreciates my fiancé, and tells my fiancé all the time,  thanks for doing a good job with her, and it's just a really good, respectful relationship.  Well, that's good that it ended up like that, then. 
[02:09:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And what do you do now?  Right now, I am in the process of buying a cornerstone building in my historic district  of my downtown city, and buying a restaurant called Seabones, it's seafood, and putting  it in a paint-your-own pottery studio.  You from, uh, you from, uh, money?  Um...  From a little bit of money, a little family money, maybe?  No way.  Um, I've never wanted for anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, she comes from money. 
[02:10:00]  No way.  Why?  Well, she definitely comes from money.  But she had that baby at 16.  Nobody's married, nobody's white parents who are rich and gone like that.  Yeah, they do.  My parents, you know what, that's what's so awesome about my parents is because they were  mature enough and strong enough to say, you know what, if this is your, if this is what  you choose to do, you move forward, you have this child, we will give you and her the life  we've continued to give you, and we're going to help you, but my father said, you're going  to lose respect to people, and you're going to have to bust your butt to get it back. 
[02:10:30]  They didn't send you off to some, uh, place to have the baby and tell all the neighbors  that she's just at boarding school.  They, they whited out her part of the will.  No, they really didn't, and I was a great example to my community.  I mean, I stood up, and I took it off.  You're a filthy whore!  Yeah.  I hear ya.  All right.  Well, that's, uh, I, that's actually a pretty good way the story could have ended up.  Because it could have ended, um, eh, worse. 
[02:11:00]  Right, Opie?  That's my partner, uh, Opie.  Opie, we call him Opie the asshole sometimes here on, uh, on the Opie and Anthony show.  Works out very well.  So what, uh, so you're buying things, that's good.  Real estate, a restaurant?  Mm-hmm.  I'm also going to be working with a company called GoSmile.  Yeah, what is that?  It is, um, a smile beauty company.  Mm-hmm.  You can go to GoSmile.com. 
[02:11:30]  Okay.  And what do they do?  And it's a teeth whitening system.  Oh, that's good.  People like that.  That's kind of taken off these days.  Well, see, you sound like you're doing pretty good even without, uh, uh, making it through  to the end of The Apprentice.  I am.  I'm doing well.  Yeah.  It would have been nice to, uh, to make it through, though, but...  You, you, you're going to watch the show.  Do you think you know who's going to win?  I have the people in my mind that I would like to see win it. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  I wouldn't watch.  I'd be so dejected and pissed.  No, I'm going to continue to watch.  I have a lot of great friends on there.  All right.  Uh, here's Donald Trump with his, uh, famous catchphrase.  All right.  Let's hear what he said.  The red button.  Oh, okay.  This one.  Christy, you really got a tough edge and you can cause a lot of problems.  This is not a popularity contest, but you're just too difficult to work with.  You're a distraction to the team.  Christy, you're fired.  Wow, that's just got to suck to hear, huh? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, it does.  It's a distraction.  If you, if you hear what Carolyn said, Carolyn says, Christy is strong-minded, but she's not  the reason they lost the task.  Right, right.  Bill agreed with Carolyn.  And then Jen M says, you know what?  Christy got things done.  You know, sometimes they want to get rid of the, uh, the strong players, too.  You know, maybe, uh, that's the way to look at it.  You were one of the strong players.  You were a threat, so they had to boot you.  I like it that.  I like it said that way.  That's good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:13:00]  There you go.  Well, why don't we leave on that high note?  All right.  Okay, great.  Hey, Christy, thanks for being, uh, on the show today.  Uh, continued success to you.  Thank you.  And, uh, good luck.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Take care.  You are...  Did you hear the slam?  Oh, I know.  She is pissed.  That was most...  I could hear it in her voice.  She did not want to be on that phone.  Um, when she picked up the phone.  Oh.  Just because of what we were talking about with Patty, and she overheard it when she was on hold.  Oh.  And then it just went downhill. 
[02:13:30]  And you...  Oh, my God.  You ever play the You're a Filthy Whore clip while I'm trying to conduct an interview?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That just, that just was shocking.  You're a Filthy Whore!  Oh, God.  The Psycho Mark Filthy Whore clip.  Oh, did she hear it?  Of course she did.  Oh, God.  What do you know it?  Go listen to the replay if you did it in here.  But then it really went down.  The silence of it, like, holy...  That's what I was laughing at, like, God damn.  I tried talking over it, and all I covered was, I think, Filthy. 
[02:14:00]  And she's just such a corporate phony.  It's like, she just showed muscle right through.  It's like, they're so detached.  You just would love to see them, just to get her right face to face.  Hey, I showed restraint.  Restraint?  Well, yeah.  Because I was going to play it the second time.  All right, you add that into your little email from Elo that you're going to get about this one.  What?  You're absolutely getting emailed from Elo.  Why?  We were just having fun.  She knows it's all about having fun, right?  Guys.  I would say so. 
[02:14:30]  Guys.  These apprentice interviews.  This is a really big deal.  They're very big.  We need these.  You're a Filthy.  You are a Filthy.  Also, Patrice just takes his headphones off, starts walking towards me.  Sometimes you've got to just walk away, don't you?  I'm just like, that's going to help because it was so, the silence of it, like, where  do you go?  And then Anthony's like, yeah, all right now.  And then I just would have been like, all righty, well, yeah, I'd want to go if I were  you.  That's where he leaves me all the time, just going, yeah, well, but the thing that makes 
[02:15:00]  it weird is that people, like, if I'm on a show and they did that, man, like, you would  have a sense that the interview is going, how it's going, and if they did that, you'd  go, man, I really did deserve that.  You know, you just would laugh and make that, like, not as, you know.  Right.  Not as uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I just think it's funny that you're trying to get away from the situation by walking away.  It's like, she's already miles away, but you think it's going to be better if you're  miles away plus four feet. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, I've done that.  Because I'm twisted up watching the uncomfortable moment, and it's just so funny.  You feel me all, and then you hear it, it was silence already, but then you hear a, like,  and I just go, oh, my God, did he just play it?  Yeah, you do.  You got to take the headphones off and get four more feet away.  But she's going to say her rich white parents were allowed her to have a kid like that,  and then her dad, you notice the bullshit edited version, my dad, wonderful people, she 
[02:16:00]  can't say, them motherfuckers told me to go and get a, they put me in the garage and  disown me.  It's like, there's no, and she sounds like real, and then, and I'm, and you think her  father talks like this and her mother talks like that, says, all right, you can have a  baby out of wedlock.  You're going to, me and mama discuss this, and you're going to have that baby if you want  it, and it's going to be fine.  We're going to, not like it, you know, he turned to her mother and just went, she's a  whore just like you.  Yep, just like you. 
[02:16:30]  You knew it.  God damn.  Come on now, you believe that bullshit?  Come on now.  Well, we should break, I guess, huh?  Wow.  My phones are all ringing, my Blackberry's going off like crazy.  Well, Polly Elo, maybe we should break and regroup.  Eric Logan, location check, up Opie's ass.  Opie, good luck, bro.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  We wanted to play Bill's Dead going into break here, remember?  You're kidding.  Because Drew started this break with that great remix of the Bill's Dead phone call, 
[02:17:00]  so we were working at a radio station in Boston for the new listeners, and this old  lady called thinking she got a hold of her old friend, but she got a hold of us.  Yep, wrong number.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat, how are you?  No, this is the wrong bill.  Uh, well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Uh, Bill, uh, Bill died today.  Yeah, kid, oh my God. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him. 
[02:18:00]  I know.  Where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big, big, big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  This time you've gone too far.

[02:23:00]  Alabama has given up on the show today.  Is that it?  They will be back when the Shwoogies are gone.  Shwoogie one and Shwoogie two.  Why don't they just get on up?  Why are he just beat boxing?  All right, throw your hands in the air.  Wave them like they just don't care.  This just in, Anthony.  We have been suspended for a week starting Monday.  Oh no, because of your little thing with the apprentice.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Oh no.  So we're suspended.  Ben ran in here.  He said you guys got to just play that again.  You want to hear the part where it's, uh...  If they got it.  Or you want to wait a little while?  I'd love to hear it.  Actually, we probably should get big A in while they find that.  Let me hear the uncomfortableness.  Yeah, let's get big A in here first and then we'll find that.  Just the silence is what got me.  It's just so creepy that...  What?  All right.  If we're suspended for a week, I'm making reservations to go on vacation.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  Yeah, I understand. 
[02:24:00]  I'm not going to take that crap.  I'm going to book a flight and everything in the next, uh, meh, hour.  I understand, Anthony.  All right.  There he is.  It's big A.  Big A, you got a website now, I hear?  Uh, uh, yes, I do, I have a website now, yes.  It's called...  Uh, thebig-a.com  Thebig-a.com  Is that with three B's?  Or four, is that B-B-B-B-I-B?

Don't feel sorry for these guys.  You know what?  Fair enough.  Patrice, we have fixed Stalker Patty's hammer toes. 
[02:25:00]  We've given her laser surgery to get rid of her unwanted hair.  Oh, she was a mess before.  Oh, we've done so many nice things.  Unemployed, just about homeless.  We've paid her rent a few times.  Fair enough.  We gave her a chance to win a lot of money by crawling across the floor in a Krusty mask,  completely naked.  Krusty the Clown mask, completely naked.  Stupid limousine service got your TheBigA.com, huh?  Yes.  Yeah, you had to put the dash in.  I'm just looking.  Isn't that a coincidence, because your job is driving a car for hire, and now a stupid 
[02:25:30]  limousine company has TheBigA.com, so you had to go TheBigDashA.com.  Yeah, he's a cab.  Yeah.  But he only drives.  Where do you drive?  Well, I drive in the Bronx.  I drive airports.  You know what's the problem with Big A's cab services, Anthony?  Ah, why?  You know, he's good at it, but he's dropping all his customers off about three or four blocks 
[02:26:00]  further than they want to be, because he has a stuttering foot.  Can't.  No?  I tried.  That was funny.  He always drops them off at the airport at terminal.  who would have been  uh...  uh...  like  uh...  uh...  as he's trying to get a vote for it  from the other places  terminals flying by  united

[02:34:00]  for your head  anything?  Thorazine?  lithium?  no i'm not on any uh... drugs  i would actually change  the way i function  yeah  just uh...  uh...  adderall  adderall  yeah right  what's adderall do?  you know like  when you play everquest  and you put haste on yourself?  yeah  that's basically haste  now i know exactly what that is  you have haste put on yourself  he's got haste  he's got the haste spell on him all the time  now haste makes you  is haste slower or faster?  no it's faster  haste is just faster 
[02:34:30]  anything is faster  why are you on that?  um...  like...  like...  back in high school i got like  there was a lot of things going on  and then they  basically said  hey try this  maybe uh...  you'll be  more  nice in school  they thought i did  but then i got tested  and they said i didn't  wouldn't they want to put you on something  that calmed you down more though?  i don't know  when i was in high school i was like  really out of  like i was a lot more like  nasty  i was a much nastier person  like when i came to doing work  and uh... 
[02:35:00]  acting  like writing papers  and talking to teachers and stuff  you were like fuck off  not like evil but like i would make  like the reports that used to get me in trouble  all the things that got me in trouble  were like  because i just had so much contempt for the school  and everybody there  what'd they do to you that built up this contempt?  i don't know i was just being stuck at st john's  that really got me pissed  i bet she's real loyal too  like if he decided that he was going to shoot everybody  he would spare the people that were nice to him  right  like you know just hey 
[02:35:30]  you didn't mess with me  you didn't mess with me  i don't fuck him  i believe that  i believe when he snaps  i don't mess with him at all man  i'm a nice guy  he's the real deal  i can just tell  and you got a lot of guns at home right?  uh... yes i do  oh you do  so that's a nice treat for everybody  well i grew up in a uh...  well we have a house upstate  and i grew up in a hunting environment  yeah  and that's basically  we were just talking uh... 30-30s earlier  yeah  nice uh... winchester  a hasty hunter  30-30  get that duck right now  kill that motherfucker  a big game hunter? 
[02:36:00]  uh... i used to  i don't really hunt as much anymore  i just don't have time  let's say patrice was an animal  what kind of gun would you have to use to take him down?  what would you use to shoot me?  a wildy .475 handgun  is that the kind of handgun they used in trimmers to kill the worm?  that's the type of handgun they used in deathwish 3  oh yeah he really likes to hunt with a handgun though  it's like he's an animal  we're talking about here  a handgun?  i mean  in the studio?  in the forest?  what are you doing?  in the forest 
[02:36:30]  patrice is running  he's in the woods and he's just running  308  308  would you use a different gun to hunt  like say  the difference between hunting the chinaman or a spanish guy  is it a different kind of gun?  patrice 308 savage  what is that one?  yeah  that's like a  nice size  a nice caliber weapon  well i wouldn't need a shotgun because  it would  i could probably hit him with something that  a little bit more precise  maybe a rifle  i would say  off the top of my head 
[02:37:00]  i would go probably 30 yard 6  yeah  or  now that  would you say  would you give me a head start?  i'll give you a day and a half boy  could you track me?  could you track me in a day and a half?  oh yeah  you could track me if i got a day and a half run  oh yeah  your imprints in the mud and the bark  of the tree where you scrape the tree  scrape the tree  what is he itching his back?  on the pocket  he's really talking about how you hunt a bear  would you follow my shit trails too? 
[02:37:30]  ugh  jesus christ  oh yeah this is burger king  so when you could really  like  if you gave me a head start somewhere  you could find me  in the woods  like a day and a half to two day head start  and uh... actually probably not  i mean i don't  i think so cause he'd have to survive  for two days patrice  you wouldn't just be running  you would have to stop  set up some kind of camp  whether just to eat something  or take a pitch  are you joking?  i wouldn't even know to do that 
[02:38:00]  i would run  you'd just keep running until you fall down  until i fell out  for two days  until i just fell  you gotta eat  you gotta find water  so if you're in familiar territory  you kinda know where the watering hole is  ah!  that's why i just keep  that'll be the call  the bird call  oh i'd see that  big red fucking boston hat  right in my crosshairs  hear that echoey  it'll hunt me  it'll hunt me just like i am  when i have a nigger call  ah!  that's a chicken nigger  and i'll hunt  i'll be drinking from the brook 
[02:38:30]  huh?  chicken nigger  huh?  huh?  wow  oh shit  alright  two days of hunting  so we got bill the intern in here  who could be hunted with a pellet gun by the way  and we got big A in here  and stalker patty went on a date with big A  and the big complaint was that he had really bad breath  bad breath  and built it  aww  aww look he's bumming  yeah is there any way that you'd be comfortable with maybe checking out his breath

[02:46:00]  the name of the disease is cocksackie disease  all right  punch it out  ass head  all right  know what we can do as they're doing that in the bathroom  so stalker patty and big a went on a date  and uh... steve made a promo about the whole thing  let's play this really fast  we're not going to break  we'll come back in like a minute  for years  andrew has waited for that special someone  a woman to spend his life with  i think it's very romantic actually  a soulmate  will you shut up  patty 
[02:46:30]  has no experienced love  i have self control all the time  and is a boring dipshit  i like doing puzzles and things from the paper  like all the crossword puzzles  the math puzzles and the post  what if someone you couldn't stand  you have no sexuality  was the only someone for you  i think she looks very beautiful  witness the romance  between a stammering maniac  with chronic halitosis 
[02:47:00]  there's a slight breath problem  and a cliché slinging bag lady  a wild and crazy evening  no matter what she says  after she says it  i want her killed  he has fun on the ferris wheel  i was too big and  it wouldn't balance  both of us  wow  but what happens  after the love  is gone  you know  just want to be  you know  friends  fuck you bitch  why can't we be  more than friends

[02:55:00]  About a week ago, they launched two astronauts up into space.  And a couple of days ago, they came back.  They came back today, as a matter of fact.  They came back today, and the sharks will be back tomorrow.  Now I've got to hear how that joke was said.  That was a bad writer.  I have no idea what that one's about.  I don't know if you folks have been following the new Chinese space program,  but about a week ago, they launched two astronauts up into space. 
[02:55:30]  And a couple of days ago, they came back today, as a matter of fact.  Came back today, and the sharks will be back tomorrow.  Chinese laundry.  Chinese laundry.  All right, let's go.  Big A, go ahead.  Congratulations to the Houston Astros.  They made it to the World Series for the first time in their 44-year history. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah!  Woo!  President Bush called the clubhouse to congratulate the team.  Uh-huh.  See, I think the president got a little confused.  Yeah.  Like he said, he called the team to prove to Kane West.  He really does care about Astro-Americans.  He stinks, and I don't like him. 
[02:56:30]  All right.  The owner of the Minnesota Vikings has publicly apologized for members of the team having sex  on a party boat on Lake Minnetonka.  Pretty wild, too.  They said more people went down on this boat than the Titanic. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, okay.  It's another ST word.  It's the ST word, for free.  Stop breathing.  I saw you stop breathing.  It's the ST words that just freeze him up.  All right.  Sorry.  They freeze him up. 
[02:57:30]  We really interrupted his timing, so you really should start over.  Yeah, you start over on that.  Hey, look.  Hey.  Look, man.  I'm trying to make it better.  I'm trying to help this guy out.  What do you mean I have to leave, motherfucker?  Really?  Man, I pay to get in this motherfucking club, man.  Let's back up.  We've screwed up your timing there, Bigger.  Yeah, we don't want to screw up your timing.  Comedy's all about timing, so you better start that joke over again.  All right.  Go ahead.  There we go.  But we're still waiting now for the results of the Iraqi election. 
[02:58:00]  And the Sunnis are now saying that the vote was rigged.  The Sunnis aren't happy.  They say the vote was rigged.  So I guess they really are getting an American-style democracy. 
[02:58:30]  Democracy.  Let's see.  Oh, Lord.  Wow.  Some of these jokes, like even a professional joker's can't even.  It's like, this joke is so smarmy, poor Big A.  Read that crap.  Nobody even says democracy in a joke. 
[02:59:00]  And this poor guy.  Democracy.  Stop.  Democracy.  Democracy.  All right.  Oh, God, no.  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  Just a couple more here, two or three.  Let's go, Big A, the big finish.  Let's go.  Get the energy up, the rhythm.  Come on.  Here we go.  Boy, this is exciting. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  They're still hunting down terrorists.  And over the weekend in Iraq, they arrested the Al-Qaeda barber.  That's right.  That's not like a nickname.  He was actually the barber.  It's an enormous breakthrough.  And now, we have a lead on Osama Bin Laden's aromatherapist. 
[03:00:00]  Now we have a lead on Osama Bin Laden's aromatherapist.  An aromatherapist.  What the fuck?  That's poor thing.  What's an aromatherapist, Big A?  Yeah.  He has no idea.  It has something to do with good smells.  All right. 
[03:00:30]  Good God.  Oh, Mother Jesus.  Patrice is never coming back.  This has been a rough ride today.  Oh, man.  A lot of potholes were.  All right.  Let's go, Big A.  Two more.  As you know, President Bush has declared war when the bird flew.  Yeah.  This is a big thing there, right?  Yes.  But you know, see, I don't think President Bush learns from his mistakes. 
[03:01:00]  Why is that?  Like today, he made a big speech at a bird sanctuary in front of a banner that said,  Mission accomplished.  That's edgy.  All right.  And finally.  Uh-oh.  Nathaniel, is this a coincidence or are you just smart?  All right.  He's just smart. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, stop.  Always got to end on and up.  No, right, Nathaniel?  Wow.  All right.  I don't know what the hell to call him anymore.  Give this a spin.  All right.  Let's go, Big A.  No talking through this one.  All right.  Saddam Hussein's trials started today.  I mean, yesterday.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Yeah, you got to start over.  Yeah.  Saddam.  Saddam Hussein's trials started yesterday. 
[03:02:00]  You folks are aware of that?  Saddam Hussein is ending trial.  Well, in court, he's doubly assisted that he is still the president.  He was defiant.  He said, I am still the president. 
[03:02:30]  You know, a little like Bush.  Wow.  I need a fan.  Dude, I just looked around the room as he was stuttering whatever he does through the S-T words.  I saw everyone pretty much stop breathing in the room.  It's a freeze up.  Everyone just stopped breathing.  It's not a stutter.  It's just a freeze up.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  It's a freeze up. 
[03:03:00]  And he said the S before, just the S.  And I just was rooting him on in my head like, yeah.  Come on, motherfucker.  Come on.  Stubborn.  Just say stubbornly.  And when he finally said it, I wanted to just go, yes, Big A.  I wanted to start the Rocky music and then all that.  You can do it.  Yes.  Big A, come here.  Come here, Big A.  Well, in court, he's doubly assisted. 
[03:03:30]  And he was defiant.  He said, I am still president.  Win, Big A.  Very good.  Let's hear it for Big A.  Adrian.  Adrian.  Oh, that was genius.  Big A.  Boy.  So what are we promoting today?  Your website? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, just my website.  And I'm taking pre-orders and shirts.  All right.  You know, let's get a feel.  Hey, do you want to start our Halloween party by doing some monologue jokes for the crowd  at the Hard Rock Cafe?  Okay.  Warm up the crowd.  Can we do that while we're on break?  Try to get some current jokes for him from monologues.  You can use Conan.  Use everybody.  Jon Stewart.  Just get the best jokes.  And he'll open up the show Halloween night at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Oh, yeah.  People just scream at him. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Ah, you fucking idiot.  All of a sudden, he'll just walk out on stage, and he'll do his monologue, and then the show  will begin officially.  How's that sound?  You like that idea?  Let's write that one down.  Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's have a good, good, good,  good, good, let's get crazy tonight.  Let's stop, stop, stop, stop.  Happy holidays.  Happy holidays.  By the way, coming soon, coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, we're going to have 
[03:05:00]  open auditions for the next Big A, or Stalker Patty, or Sandy Kane, what?  You turned the lights down, bro.  Who is that?  The guy with the I Love Thans?  The guy with the I Love Thans?  He just turned the lights off.  Oh, he was trying to sneak out, and he turned the lights off, so we all have to stop.  He turned the lights out.  What's that with Nathan, his producer?  What?  Is Nathan your producer?  Yeah, oh yeah.  His producer?  Yeah, he's really, he's a big guy on campus now.  We've got a great staff behind us.  All right. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  And he's, he does stand-up.  He's doing real well.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's doing very well.  So we're going to do open auditions on the Opie and Anthony show in the very near future.  When we get back from break, we'll promote it for a week or two.  Open audition, you come down to the station at 7 in the morning, if you think you got something  for this show.  Whatever that is.  Whatever.  You know the characters, like Papua Monaki, Big A, Stalker Patty.  Something you think would be liked by the audience.  Right.  I think a little off.  A little off, definitely.  All right. 
[03:06:00]  Can somebody, like, say what they think?  Is there anybody out there that what they think is wrong with, uh, as a, as a term for  what he's, what's he doing?  I don't know.  Have you ever been to something there, Big A, a speech therapist?  Well, as a kid, I have been, and during high school, I went to a speech therapist.  What'd they tell you?  Wow.  I hope she got fired.  What'd she tell you?  Told him to slow down, and he still went.  She used to go, hey, stubbornly.  Now he goes, uh, uh. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, boy.  Someone was saying that, um, what the hell is that?  Dapper Dan from PA.  Listening online, it sounds like the buffer is freezing when Big A talks.  Like, you know, when you're listening.  She'd be a false sex girl.  Yeah.  What'd you, what'd you do?  For only $9.95 a minute, you could get all the sexual satisfaction.  Is your, your hand, your hand on your, on it, right? 
[03:07:00]  No.  No.  Take your finger on your clitoris and s, s, s, s.  Emulate yourself.  Like a $1,000 phone call.  It cost me $1,000.  It cost me $1,000.  It cost me $1,000.  Ugh.  I'll see.  Like, what the hell is that?  I'll see.  Yeah.  Now, do you own some type of s-s, s-s, s-s-s-ual-d-d-device? 
[03:07:30]  Okay.  Hey, lube it up and...  Big A isn't laughing with everybody. 
[03:08:00]  No, I just can't look at Big A. I just feel bad.  Yeah, don't look behind you right now.  All right, Big A, we'll see you at the Halloween party.  Yes.  You know what you're going to be yet?  Is it a surprise?  A lot of people are wondering what Big A is going to be at the Halloween party.  Surprise.  All right.  First come, first serve as far as this party goes, by the way.  Halloween night at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square.  The door's open at 7, I think.  All right?  Yes.  Oh, WWE.  Yeah.  WWE, whatever.  Yeah.  It's going to be...  We're going to blow it out that night. 
[03:08:30]  It's going to be great.  T-shirt that we're giving out to everybody at the event.  If you can't make it, my brother made a special one-year anniversary XM slash Halloween type  shirt.  And you can order them by going to opanthony.com, okay?  Roy.  In case you're somewhere else and you just want a shirt.  Drew Boogie, get us out of here.  Are you going to do some kind of Steve thing here?  Yeah, Steve is going to help us out here for a second.  He wanted to do some aeronautic maneuvers with his hybrid car.  Is it aeronautic?  Is that the right word?  Sure, yeah.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  And so...  Aerobatic. 
[03:09:00]  Aerobatic?  Is he flying, you know, erratically and stuff and doing tricks?  Yes.  Aerobatic, then.  He got it all fixed and learned how to drive real well with it.  Oh, well.  After he pimped it out, so...  We're going to see how well this works out.  Let's hope he doesn't crash.  All right.  Drew Boogie, everyone.  Geez, no one wants to fly.  I can't do a while.  Shelton, hello, those stars are thrown on their way.  Let's go.  I mean, what?  It does, won't you?  Well, definitely not.  Have a not, you know.

So, never know, all of you continue their way. 
[03:09:30]  Except their way it could be people alguack czy your dream too.  One time, you're going to get out of here.  Well, he got it.  He was a grandma.  He was a long time.  He liked the teen.  We'll be right back. 
[03:10:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:10:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:11:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:11:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:12:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:12:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:13:00]  Well, before we get out of here, we've got a couple things to do, definitely.  First of all, we've got to make sure everyone checks out Jimmy Norton's HBO special Tonight  at Midnight on HBO, of course.  Patriceoneal.com, Drew Boogie in studio.  Oh, I'm going to be at a comic strip this Saturday, tomorrow.  Where's that?  That's on 82nd and 2nd in the city. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, yeah, I've been there.  It's a good club.  I haven't been there in a long time.  Upper East Side.  Upper East Side Comedy Club.  Didn't Seinfeld start there or something?  Yeah, Chris Rock, Seinfeld.  Eddie Murphy started there.  He has an old Seinfeld contract in a frame or something.  Yeah, he got a lot of that old school star stuff, Paul Reiser stuff.  Like paying Seinfeld, like, I don't know, $20 to perform one night or something.  Back in the day, yeah.  He's got the contract or a signed check.  I don't know.  He has something.  I remember seeing something, something back in the day.  All right, we can't get out of here without talking about this guy that's on the cover 
[03:14:00]  of the Daily News.  The story, meet the man who spent $241,000 in one night at scores.  Impossible.  Of course, a strip club here in New York City.  They're calling him the lap dunce.  Lap dunce.  I get it.  Daily News trying to be funny again with their headlines. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  The lap dunce.  What's this story about, Anthony?  I don't know much about this one.  I do know American Express is suing this guy because he refused to pay the bill.  It's the guys like this that ruin it for people with American Express cards that just want  to go in and all of a sudden now American Express is going to go, you're not going to  be allowed to use them at the strip clubs.  You watch.  You watch.  But I don't have an American Express.  You don't have one?  It's because you've got to pay it.  You have to pay it all at the end of the month, right?  So it's usually for people with businesses, right? 
[03:15:00]  Or white people.  Or white people.  White people.  What's wrong with paying your fucking bill?  It's not wrong with paying your fucking bill.  It's just that at the end of the month, well, P. Diddy's P. Diddy.  Yeah, I know.  You know what I'm saying?  You hear about the American Express black card, though?  You've got to spend like a quarter of a mil a month.  Quarter of a mil.  Is it a month?  Something like that.  You've got to maintain like a quarter of a mil a month.  Yeah, I heard it's a ridiculous amount.  And you can't just get one.  No, they have to invite you. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  It's not, you can't apply for it or anything.  They say, would you like to have a black card?  Trust me.  I know.  I know.  Oh.  I keep telling them to stop calling me.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  I'm trying to watch The Apprentice.  Why do people get into these scores, girls, man?  It just doesn't do it.  I don't find them sexy.  I find them to be what's stripping.  It's like, that's why I tell you about Brazil, why I love Brazil so much is just because it  takes, they give you the fantasy. 
[03:16:00]  You already know you're paying money.  But these girls are, look at these two girls, the pictures of the girls.  They look so, give me your money.  There's nothing hot about either of these chicks.  Either two, they just look like nothing at all.  But they just look like just slutty bitches taking your money.  There's no imagination to them.  Old banged up stripper whores.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  That are going to take a huge amount of your money.  A lap dance.  You know what they got to do?  The doctors out there, they got to figure out the breast implant.  I'm sorry. 
[03:16:30]  They still don't have it figured out.  Well, you know.  Most of these girls, I mean, we've had a lot of them march through the studios over the  years, and they look great in a sweater or something.  And then, you know, they strip for us, and all of a sudden they got cock-eyed nipples.  Look like goldfish eyes, right?  All sorts of shit's going on.  And then it looks like they're bursting.  They're ready to pop at any second.  There's no movement.  I hate, hate implants.  I know a girl with implants.  I know a girl with implants.  Every once in a while.  They're fantastic.  Well, I was going to say that.  Every once in a while, we'll have a girl come through the studio, and we'll swear that 
[03:17:00]  she's natural.  And she'll admit, she goes, no, it's under the muscles, the key, I guess.  And Jimmy feels them.  You know what makes a good pair?  It has to be some damage to them where they lose the titty meat.  Well, the problem is a lot of these girls, they still have a baby.  Well, the problem is a lot of these girls have little A's, and they don't have a body  that was made for D's.  But they still go D's.  And I'm sure the doctor's like, look, this is not good.  If they've got droopy A's, droopy ones, like the... 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah, because then you've got some skin.  Then you can just fill it in.  You've got some skin to work with.  You fill in the meat, and that's it.  But other than that, to stretch it out, look at this girl's breast.  And it's shiny.  It looks like makeup's on it.  They're all stretched out where it looks like, yeah, if you run your thumbnail across  it, the whole thing's going to split open.  It just looks terrible, man.  It's all big and...  But if the other one, the Chinese one has red, the one in the red, if she has fake  ones, they're pretty good.  Because they still have a droop to them, sort of.  No, they look like they're real, actually.  Whores.  Disgusting whores.  Just look horrible, right?  Right. 
[03:18:00]  On what?  Some lap dances where they don't let you touch them?  Yeah.  Not a big fan of the...  No, naked.  Not a big fan of the lap dance or the breast and breast.  As soon as the song is over, they go, thanks, bye.  It's like, who gets off on that, dude?  We've said that many times on the show.  I don't get off on that.  All right, so this guy spent $241,000.  He's a CEO from St. Louis.  Right.  St. Lou.  He bought...  And what does he work for?  Let's see.  He's a big spender, Robert McCormick, 38 years old, married, father of three, heads an international 
[03:18:30]  computer networking company called Savas Communications.  And he insists he only spent $20,000 that night.  And, of course, the tab that they're saying is $241,000.  Here's some of the items up for bid.  Here's some of the items that he allegedly bought and was supposed to have paid for.  Sixty-five private rooms at $1,000 each.  Of course, you can figure that out.  Did he bring a lot of guys to the club?  That's what I'm thinking.  They closed some kind of big deal, and he brought some people with him. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, this can't just be one guy.  I need $65,000 rooms.  So, 65 G's there.  Here, 2,576 lap dances at $20 a pop.  This was in one night?  One night.  It's $51,520.  The math...  2,500 lap dances?  The math doesn't work out.  The math...  How many girls are there?  Have you been to schools?  There's no way they have 65 rooms. 
[03:19:30]  It's like...  What are they talking about?  Did they do private rooms like one room all night for 65...  Ben, you know anything about this one?  Yes.  Ben knows a little bit.  There's been several cases about this.  They've had...  There was a case about this that Scores is padding this stuff a few months ago.  And I actually have a friend that has an Amex expense account.  It was like $3,000 more on his bill.  So, this isn't the first time Scores has been accused of doing this stuff.  They probably saw a sucker coming and said, let's...  Yeah, look at the guy.  Instead...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[03:20:00]  McCormick could have bought five lap dances at $20 a pop for each of his 2,000 employees.  It wasn't 2,000 people down there, though.  How many people...  I want to know how many people he had with him.  I understand that.  That's very important.  Even if it's...  Even if he had 50 guys there, that's...  50 lap dances a person.  Yeah.  Right?  Did I do the math right?  What?  Three what?  Three what?  If you have 50 guys there... 
[03:20:30]  50 guys get three dances?  No, no, no.  You get one dance.  You get one song.  You get one song.  No, you tell us.  What are you...  He's feeding it to me.  He's telling me three, so I said three.  So, 50 guys get three lap dances, and it's 25...  All right, Derek's pissed off now.  $51,000.  Three guys.  What about three guys?  That's what I'm hearing.  He only had three guys with him.  He only had three guys with him?  Oh, they stole from the guy, man.  That's impossible.  No, this is impossible, because then...  Look at this. 
[03:21:00]  Eight hundred and fifty bottles of water at nine bucks a pop.  He paid $7,650 for water.  Do you think 850 people going in, even during the day?  But he's saying there was only three guys there.  Eight hundred and fifty bottles of water.  Seven hundred and fifty shots at $17.50 a pop.  I've been that thirsty and horny before.  With three of your friends.  Three of your friends had 350 martinis.  They had over a hundred martinis each at $22 a pop for a martini. 
[03:21:30]  And if that wasn't good enough...  Thirty bottles of champagne, because they each need ten bottles of champagne.  Yeah, because they're not drunk enough yet.  And they each had almost a thousand lap dances apiece.  McCormick, 40, wound up at Scores the night of October 22nd with three business acquaintances  and handed over his charge card.  Three business acquaintances.  Well, then they're fucking him.  Then they're fucking him.  Yeah, they stole from him, dude.  How did they... 
[03:22:00]  Unless he's drunk running around going, what does everyone need?  Or, or, unless...  All right.  He, he, this is a deal he made with Scores, because he might have paid for some pussy.  And, you know, the girls probably charged a G.  He was getting bored.  He might have four girls.  Mark it down as water.  And they probably worked it out.  Mark it down as water.  So this is what came out.  Because these bitches think they're high price.  I've been to Scores once or twice.  It sickens me.  But these particular girls, they're probably a G to pop in the back. 
[03:22:30]  Maybe two Gs to pop in the back.  So if you have three guys...  All right, hold on, guys.  Then this is code.  All right, code.  65 private rooms.  That's where the sex went on.  So, okay.  You're paying for that.  Okay, lap dances or lap dances.  That's the foreplay, okay?  850 bottles of water.  Blowjob.  That's 850 BJs, let's be honest here.  750 shots at 1750.  A pop, that's a little better than a BJ.  That's probably...  Shots is...  That's probably regular intercourse, I'm thinking.  That's fucking...  And you know what the martinis are.  The martinis is the dirty hole. 
[03:23:00]  Fucking them up the ass.  And who has...  That's the dirty martini.  No one has 30 bottles.  That's the dirty martini.  Olive not included.  And no one has 30 bottles of $3,200 champagne laying around.  Yeah, just laying around.  You would have four.  Yeah.  And then High Roller would come in and he would go, we're all out.  But we do have two $2,500 ones left.  Yeah, we got the Cristal.  He was paying for sex and he begged them.  He begged them to put this on some other way.  Because he's married.  Yeah, he's married.  He's got kids. 
[03:23:30]  We got a guy that says this guy's notorious all over St. Louis.  Walter.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, the Savas, man.  His company sponsors the stadium where the St. Louis Blues play hockey.  It's the Savas Center in St. Louis.  And that Scores place is, yeah, the Taurus Hookerville, man.  They've been raided a few times.  I'm in Indianapolis now, but I used to live in St. Louis.  They've been taken down a bunch, man.  So, yeah, that guy was buying pussy left and right.  And I hear they also have mafia ties. 
[03:24:00]  So I'm going to officially go on the radio and say I have no fucking idea what they do at Scores.  This guy, then, is a lying prick and he spent all that money there.  That's right.  Because there's no way they would play themselves.  This is what an entire company, you know, you take a hundred guys couldn't do this much  at a, you know, not even this much.  He would have to walk in and the entire night buy everybody in the place everything they wanted. 
[03:24:30]  Everyone that walked in to Scores that night, he said, the night's on me.  Get whatever you want.  And one guy gets fucking 20 lap dances the whole night.  And all day, right.  A conga wine.  And still 850 bottles of water.  Who's ordering water?  I'm telling you, this dude, he works something out with them to, like,  just make it sound like that.  And now American Express, he's probably like, these guys, he set something up with them 
[03:25:00]  because he spent a lot of money.  They can't put, okay, we bought some pussy, you know, because these girls are charging a G  because they're these high, you know, 22-year-old, high-class ones.  Probably, maybe two Gs.  Who knows?  You know what I'm saying?  Probably five.  Maybe five.  Exactly.  And when he got the bill, he's like, they still, even the deal he worked out, he still  felt like they fucked him.  Right.  Even the sneaky thing.  And now it's coming out, and American Express got the bill, and they itemized it. 
[03:25:30]  But I bet you this guy is fucking them.  And now they're probably going to come out and fuck him back by saying he bought pussy.  I want to know what it is about these fucking clubs, though, that justifies $9 for a bottle  of water.  You know they're not paying these girls.  They're not paying these fucking girls money.  No.  They're not.  They're paying them shit.  They work off of tips.  They work off of fucking tips.  They usually have to be split with the fucking club.  So they're making money on the girls, never mind having to spend it. 
[03:26:00]  The booze cost them the same.  The booze companies aren't going, oh, you're a strip club?  Well, it's ten times more to buy from us than it would if you were a local pub.  Why do they get away with selling bottles of water for nine fucking dollars each?  A martini for $22 for a fucking martini.  They do that everywhere.  I know.  Why?  Sporting events.  No, no, no, no, no.  Not to this level.  Well.  Not to this fucking level.  Oh, so it's okay to spend four or five hours on a bottle of water when you go to a  sporting event? 
[03:26:30]  You know something?  Four or five for a sporting event.  For water.  That's high end and that'll piss you off.  All the movies they do.  All the movies.  All the movies.  I mean, popcorn, a bag of shitty popcorn.  Popcorn costs two cents to make.  So if you think of markup, you know, popcorn is...  Well, so does...  Twelve million percent.  We will find nothing more expensive than in a tit bar.  Nine dollars for a bottle of fucking water.  I could go to the best hotel in New York City and pull a bottle of water out of the mini  bar and it ain't going to be nine bucks. 
[03:27:00]  Well, how about the fact that, you know, if you buy a nine dollar bottle of water, you  shouldn't have to tip.  Like, anything you buy in there, they should work something out with the girls, like charge  twelve dollars for the water, but the girls just constantly rub your bag.  Oh, when they see you drinking a bottle of water?  Oh, you drinking that water hot, baby.  Their tits are around your neck.  Oh.  You pour something out of my tits and I'll push it in your face.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like, so that they don't have to be mad.  Because if I go in there, just as a guy who doesn't have an American Express card or 
[03:27:30]  $200,000 to spend, I'm like, wait a minute.  Okay, I got a hundred dollars.  I bought two waters and I got like $56 left.  Bitch, can I not tip you and you still dance?  Like, I'm going to be a schlub even though I got to buy the two drink minimum, $44, two  martinis.  You know what I mean?  Right, $44 for two martinis.  So I got $56 left to have a good time at scores.  One lap dance, now I got $36 left and then I get thirsty again because I got a little 
[03:28:00]  horny.  So I bought another $12 bottle of water.  And now how are you getting home?  Walking?  Now it's like, you understand?  No cab money?  So it's like, charge me $12 and that's her $3 tip and if she can get me like, ooh, you  look thirsty and the thirstier you get, the horny.  Ooh, drink more and it's just like, oh, I'm going to have three bottles.  So that's $9 to her and $9 to the club because she got three bottles, you know, and you go 
[03:28:30]  and you say to the bartender, hey, this hoe right here made me thirsty and they mark it  down, you know, sugar draws is the one that made me drink.  Right.  You know, so that they can work something out with them because this is fucking ridiculous,  man.  They figured out a way to make you pay through the nose for everything.  Let's say hi to Tom and T-Neck.  Hey, what's up, boys?  You did the math?  Yeah, kid.  I'm using round numbers.  Okay.  2,500 lap dances, lap dances, figure songs, three minutes, four guys.  It would take 31.25 hours. 
[03:29:00]  And dude, that's if it's going constantly like tag team.  That's not even taking a piss break, nothing.  That is, all right, you in, go!  And then after a while you go, hold on, bitch, my lap hurts.  Yeah.  My lap is burning.  They're probably playing three songs at a time just to get the tally-up.  Jesus, man.  Here's a question.  Did he sign the bill at the end of the night? 
[03:29:30]  I don't know.  Well, they was accused.  If you read, they were accused.  Well, it seems like Amex has them good here.  No, Amex actually now told the guy he's got to pay Amex.  Amex is good.  If you've got a problem with Amex, you call them up and go, this person fucked me.  I don't want to pay the bill.  They go, we're on it.  And Amex has their own people that fight for your money.  But the thing is, you've got to pay the fucking bill to Amex.  If they find out that you were fucked, they send you back the money. 
[03:30:00]  Right.  If they find out you weren't fucked, they keep it.  But you've still got to pay.  American Express is going, don't worry, we'll foot the bill for you for a while here until we sort this out.  Somebody accused them of forging their name.  Right, right.  This happened before, yeah.  So, I don't know.  Did he sign it?  I don't think it would say it if he signed it.  As you try to find that answer, let's say hi to Jason in Florida.  Hey, Jason.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, listen.  Same thing happened to me.  Not quite this amount of money, but same thing happened in the old gold club in Atlanta. 
[03:30:30]  Go in with some buddies, you know, bachelor party.  We probably dropped $700 or $800 on my credit card.  I get the bill.  It's like $6,000.  So, they do this all over the place.  You know what I mean?  They're charging you exorbitant amounts of money for, you know, drinks.  Dom Perignon, you get charged $500 for a bottle of champagne.  It's insane.  And here's the hustle, though.  Here's the hustle.  I just thought about it.  Because this guy, you married, dude?  Well, I am now, yeah.  Yeah, the gold club is where Ewing got blown, by the way. 
[03:31:00]  Thank you, Ben, from the other room.  I was wondering that.  That's the hustle.  You know what they might be doing, too?  They might be catching guys where they got something to lose.  These married businessmen, they see a ring on their finger.  Right, right.  And they go, well, we're going to take a couple of extras.  What is he going to say?  He's not going to yell about it because he's in a strip club.  He's not supposed to be.  You know what I mean?  Well, this isn't looking good for him.  Hold on, sir.  This isn't looking good for him.  Because he was spending so much money, the club had McCormick sign repeated waivers,  repeated waivers, identified with his own fingerprint. 
[03:31:30]  So he was signing it and fingerprinting these waivers, swearing he was not intoxicated and  was willing to be held responsible for the charges.  And the owner said he actually kept American Express aware hour by hour of what the guy  was spending.  There you go.  He's just a dummy.  He was being informed every hour what this guy was spending.  But on this?  What did he do?  Lap dunce.  Lap dunce.  I don't know. 
[03:32:00]  This guy, it just sounds like some guy who spent well beyond his means.  This?  The guy just said it's going to take 32 hours to do this.  Just to do one part of that.  Not even the whole list.  Right.  How long, how many hours would it take for him to drink 30 minutes or something with  the, just making it look like it was something else, so.  Right.  You know?  Maybe, you know, three girls at a time on a lap dance.  You never see those guys.  Hey, I want three girls.  I want the music.  I want all three.  Is it? 
[03:32:30]  And then drinking the fucking $22 martini.  Probably like hanging out in an area where maybe there's a couple other people that he  deems cool.  It's like, hey buddy, you want to dance?  Hey, get this guy over here.  It's like throwing the darts on the boardwalk.  You're just throwing darts.  You're thinking nothing about it.  And then all of a sudden they hand you the bill and say, that'll be it.  You'll find out how much, if there's a high class stripper out there who sold some on  the side, how much would a high class stripper sell a little bit of side coochie in the 
[03:33:00]  champagne room?  Right.  Like high class scores type of bitch.  What did they buy for five G's?  Because the bunny ranch costs a G.  Yeah.  If you go to the bunny ranch, it's a G to fuck around in here.  And that's legit.  I think this guy, yeah.  A little sex was being bought.  Had it covered up with the water.  $15,000 just for three girls if it's $5,000 a pound.  Yeah.  All right.  And finally, the unknown Oregon lottery winner.  Oh, yeah.  This guy from Oregon.  Do we know who he is yet? 
[03:33:30]  He won $340 million, right?  Yeah, they showed him.  Oh, they did?  Just some guy.  Is this audio...  An average Joe.  Oh, I thought they still didn't know who he is.  Well, let's go to the tape here.  In quiet Jacksonville, Oregon today, the talk of the town has been who?  Who in this old gold rush town struck it rich big time?  Thanks for playing America's biggest jackpot game.  The buzz everybody comes in.  Is it you?  Is it you?  All state lottery officials will say is that that monster $340 million ticket was purchased 
[03:34:00]  here in Jacksonville, either at Ray's Food Place, the local grocer, where it is not business  as usual, or just down the road at the local watering hole.  If the winner is out there, flip that ticket over, sign the back of it, make sure your name's  on there.  Good morning, the Oregon Lottery.  This is Vanita.  At Oregon's lottery headquarters, their switchboards lit up as thousands of millionaire hopefuls  double-checked their digits.  Double-checking. 
[03:34:30]  Double-checked their digits.  I never even come close.  I know there's people that come.  Actually, some former politician, a senator or something, won second prize.  He won something like $800,000.  This guy's rich.  He's a millionaire.  New Hampshire, is that the guy?  Yeah.  He won like $800,000.  Four tickets purchased in the state match the first five numbers drawn.  Providing runner-ups with a more than $850,000 payday. 
[03:35:00]  Michael King and Jessica Warner have a date for the altar.  We would have got married sooner or later.  We would have figured out a way.  But this just adds to it.  I mean, you can just have the wedding you always dreamed of.  And listen to this.  U.S. Senator, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, already married and worth millions in stocks,  collected his runner-up check.  The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee received a major windfall.  To be exact, $853,492. 
[03:35:30]  Have you told your wife?  I have, and she's already told me, don't spend it.  I've got plans.  But all eyes are still here in Salem, Oregon,  where officials will be waiting with a big, fat $340 million pay check.  And Matt and Katie, a very special parking spot for the winners.  So, guys, time to come clean.  Oh, that is unbelievable.  And then you take the cash, so, you know.  The lump sum? 
[03:36:00]  You just get a little over half.  No, see, that's the problem with those things.  What?  They pay every year for, like, a long, long time.  No, you could take the lump sum.  You could just take the lump sum.  You take the lump sum, they give it all at once, but they take all the taxes out.  I thought if you did that, it was a lesser amount.  You could, like, get the $340 million over the next 20 years.  Yeah, there is a lesser amount.  There is a penalty involved there.  That's what I mean.  And you have to pay the taxes, but it's worth doing.  Oh, yeah.  Get the money now.  Screw.  Fucking thing.  Yeah.  Wait 20 years.  Oh, God. 
[03:36:30]  But that is ridiculous money.  And the reason people do it is because you can't will the rest of your win.  If you get the yearly thing, if you die, you can't go, hey, my daughter's going to.  Yeah.  The $110 million is what Travis held up.  The guy will get cash.  Here we go.  We're running on a show.  Getting a lot of requests for Christy, the apprentice.  We isolated the...  Oh, yeah.  I want to hear that.  You want to hear it again before we get out of here?  Yeah.  We can thank Patrice O'Neill for stopping by. 
[03:37:00]  Thanks, Rose, for having me.  Thank you, sir.  You're going to be at Comic Strip?  Yeah, tomorrow night.  And you'll be back on the show soon.  Always a pleasure.  Jimmy Norton on HBO Tonight at Midnight, his big half-hour comedy special.  Drew Boogie in the house.  I want to thank Drew for stopping in.  Always a lot of fun.  Have a good vacation.  Yeah, we're going to be on vacation.  We'll be back the Monday before the Halloween party to get everyone pumped for that, okay?  Paisano of Mulberry Street, Anthony, as I cue this thing up.

All right, Anthony, we've got to set this up.  So we had the loser from The Apprentice on the show.  We found out that she had a kid at 16 years old or got pregnant at 16 years old.  And the interview was kind of boring. 
[03:38:30]  So I popped in and played Mr. Asshole today, and it got very, very, very uncomfortable.  Want to add anything to this?  Not at all.  Self-explanatory?  Yeah.  They didn't send you off to some place to have the baby and tell all the neighbors that she's just at boarding school.  They whited out her part of the will.  No, they really didn't.  And I was a great example to my community.  I mean, I stood up and I took a...  You're a self-explanatory boy!  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  I hear you.  All right.  Well, that's actually a pretty good way the story could have ended up.  Because it could have ended worse.  Right, Opie?  That's my partner, Opie.  Opie.  We call him Opie the Asshole sometimes here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Works out very well.  So you're buying things?  That's good.  Real estate?  A restaurant?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:39:30]  I'm also going to be working with a company called Go Smile.  Yeah, what is that?  It is a smile beauty company.  Mm-hmm.  You can go to gosmile.com.  Okay.  And what do they do?  And it's a teeth whitening system.  Oh, that's good.  People like that.  That's kind of taken off these days.  Well, see, you sound like you're doing pretty good, even without making it through to the  end of The Apprentice.  I am.  I'm doing well.  Yeah.  It would have been nice to make it through, though, but you're going to watch the show? 
[03:40:00]  Do you think you know who's going to win?  I have the people in my mind that I would like to see win it.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  I wouldn't watch.  I'd be so dejected and pissed.  No, I'm going to continue to watch.  I have a lot of great friends on there.  All right.  All right.  Here's Donald Trump with his famous catchphrase.  All right.  Let's hear what he said.  The red button.  Oh, okay.  This one.  This one.  Oh, okay. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Program complete. </pre>
