<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their upcoming move to a new studio.  They shared funny stories about renovations in their current studio, particularly an expensive, rarely-used adjustable console.  They also detailed the process of giving away leftover office items to listeners, including signed memorabilia (lots of Jeff Norris items), a Snuggie, and a listener's photo with President Bush wearing a "Wow" hat.  Logistical issues with the new studio, like a lack of nearby amenities and high parking fees, were also addressed, along with their anxieties about the move, comparing it to moving houses.  The hosts also touched upon New York City taxes and a proposed increase for high-income earners, as well as a politician's suggestion to allow low-income individuals to stop paying minimal taxes.

The show then announced upcoming guests: Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa, Jay Moore, Bob Saget, and Doug Stanhope.  A large segment focused on the cancellation of the soap opera "Guiding Light," covering its radio origins, notable actors (including a host's childhood crush on Hayden Panettiere), sponsors, and the evolution of its format and broadcast length.  Further discussions included a listenerâ€™s photo with President George W. Bush, the departure of a staff member (Stunt Brain), and numerous listener calls. Callers shared anecdotes about a homemade motorized bar stool leading to an OVI arrest, the prevalence of Segways (including a chimp riding one), homemade motorized vehicles (like a racing lawnmower), the decline of Detroit, and being mistaken for a woman due to their voices.  Throughout this portion of the broadcast, the hosts made several sexually suggestive comments and used homophobic slurs. The overall tone remained casual, conversational, and irreverent.

A significant portion of the show centered on comedian Bob Nelson and his decades-long, unchanged act, featuring football player and boxer bits. Hosts and callers shared anecdotes about seeing Nelson perform, emphasizing the unchanging nature of his material despite his aging appearance.  The discussion extended to LA comedians crafting "industry sets" for television, and movie trailers for the latest Star Trek and Terminator films, sparking a humorous hypothetical: a dark and gritty Christian Bale-starring *Back to the Future* remake.  Several callers recounted their own experiences with Bob Nelson's act, including one describing his recent performance as a "retirement show" with audience requests for classic bits.  The show also mentioned prizes given away to the studio audience, including signed memorabilia and wrestling merchandise.  The segment concluded with a repetitive, humorous string of "All rights" from the hosts.  Comedian Jimmy was mentioned but not explicitly stated as being physically present in the studio besides the hosts.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio. 
[00:04:30]  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  This old gag.  Do you feel like we need a little vacation? 
[00:05:00]  Vacation.  Vacation time is right around the corner.  It's a crazy week.  Built for us.  I think they call it a little bit.  Do you remember when they were going through this?  They were asking, they were asking like, what do you need? 
[00:05:30]  That's cool.  We're going to do this?  Well, then we kind of said, we want the console to go up and down.  We'll rip the entire ceiling out and we'll raise the whole thing up.  Yeah.  They put nice XM accoutrement.  Yeah.  A little lighting fixtures. 
[00:06:00]  And then it's like, okay, now get out.  I like the console going up and down because we really insisted on that.  I think we moved it once.  As a joke, we moved it all the way up before we left.  So Ron and Fez came in like, what the hell's this?  Yeah.  That was thousands.  Hey, Fez.  That was thousands and thousands of dollars they spent on something we never used.  Yeah.  And now they just trashed this place and I don't know.  I guess they cut this room into cubicles for the next people coming in.  Is that it?  I think so.  I have no idea what they're doing with this space. 
[00:06:30]  And then we move over to the big building.  Look at all the stuff.  Wow.  There's more stuff coming out every day.  I guess we didn't want to acknowledge that people were coming by the show Monday, Tuesday,  and Wednesday.  Huh?  You rock.  We gave them the crappiest crap and now the good stuff is being taken out of the office.  It gets better as the finale, the grand finale of our being here at the studio comes up.  Getting better?  At this point, everybody that shows up will get something from our office.  Oh, boy.  And something pretty good. 
[00:07:00]  Really?  You've got to go over there.  There's a lot of signed stuff over there.  There's a lot of shite.  Not so much shite this time.  No, that's pretty good.  I see a Snuggie, so.  I'm sure there's a few shitey items, but.  Is there a ShamWow with some hooker blood on it?  So, one of our listeners got a picture with the president, President Bush, and he's wearing  a wow hat, I do believe.  So, who's going to get that besides the guy that.  Not the president, by the way.  Was in the picture.  Huh?  Not the president, but that would have been a good one. 
[00:07:30]  But somebody that doesn't know the guy that has a picture with the president is going  to get that picture.  So, I guess that's one of the shite items.  Oh, Jeff Norris.  A lot of Jeff Norris stuff, I noticed.  Publicity photo.  A lot of Jeff Norris stuff.  A lot of Jeff Norris.  Publicity photo, man.  I haven't seen Jeff in a long time.  A lot of Jeff Norris stuff.  Why do we have a lot of Jeff Norris stuff?  I don't know.  Everybody else's stuff seems to make it out of there.  An old friend of the show.  Make it out of there.  Haven't seen him in a while.  I hear he still uses the fact that he's a regular on the Opie and Anthony show when 
[00:08:00]  he's doing his comedy, but.  Right after the one appearance he did on the XM here, we said, hey, you know, if you have  any CDs or something, drop it off for us.  Okay.  And he came back with a whole box full of just signed stuff that, yes, we've never  used.  That he wanted to give us before he hung himself.  Like what?  Norris was here.  The white gorilla.  We should see where he is these days.  Here, Eric.  I know Jeff.  I don't need a signed photo of him.  I'm going to stare at his picture all day. 
[00:08:30]  You can just go and say hi to him.  Right.  I'm going to frame it.  I know the guy.  And there were already people outside waiting to come in at 5, 15, whatever the time was  when I rolled up.  So that they apparently get a big kick out of me pulling up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I pull up like Starsky and Hutch.  You do a nice little spin turn for them?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there was somebody getting out of a cab with a few boxes of donuts.  Ah.  And the cab was blocking where I usually park.  Yeah.  So I gave him like my normal three to four seconds to move. 
[00:09:00]  And then, bam, laid on the horn at 5 in the morning.  Nice.  At 5.30.  That's nuts.  That's what people need.  And then people were just like, yeah.  I was like, I just get out of the cab.  And I'm like, I'm going to get out of my car.  And the listeners are looking at me.  And I just go, savages.  Savages.  It's a big laughter, I'm sure.  Yes.  Some guffaws were had by all.  Hey, Kenny did some reconnaissance for us yesterday.  Did he?  Nothing is open near the new building.  Oh, Christ. 
[00:09:30]  I mean, literally nothing.  If it was anyone else, I'd be like, bullshit.  Something's got to be open.  Check better.  Kenny would probably canvas the entire area with the sole purpose of finding something  that's open.  He says nothing opens before 6 a.m.  He says there's no coffee shops.  He goes, believe it or not, there's not even a Starbucks.  And you know, those things are on every corner.  They seem to be everywhere.  Even on the Broadway?  Because you go block down, you're on Broadway. 
[00:10:00]  Ask Kenny.  Oh, boy.  Kenny would know.  I believe Kenny, yeah.  He gave me the full report yesterday.  And then he's like, and the parking lots, we're going to save $50 a month.  That's good news at least.  He's got it all figured out for the move over to the big government.  I saw that, the whole parking garage thing.  Yeah.  And how, because I pay pretty big fee there monthly.  How much?  Pretty big fee.  How much?  The rest of the country will go, oh my God.  Finder's fee?  What is it, $4.500?  I think so, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  $4.500, I do believe.  They pull it right out now, so I don't even remember.  Yeah, that's...  And I used to get the bills and not pay them.  Yeah.  And they'd yell at me.  And then they put up a big sign.  They put up a big sign at the parking garage.  You can no longer pay at this facility.  It's like, all right, now you can make it a pain in the ass for me.  So where do you pay?  And then I had to just have them taken out of a credit card or something.  Ah, I see.  It was a big pain in the ass, to tell you the truth.  That's a good idea, though, man.  But they keep...  I park in my building, and the prices go up. 
[00:11:00]  Where do you sleep?  Oh, no, no, no.  I don't sleep and park in the same area.  I park in the basement, and then I go up and sleep.  Oh.  Good improv, Jim.  I could have done something with that, and I just answered it literally.  What a fucking faggot I am.  It's early.  Yeah.  But no, it's like...  And then they just raise the prices, and it's like, all right, what are you going to do?  You can't do anything.  Am I going to fight them and go, I'll park in the 40s, 30 blocks from my home?  I'm going to walk to my car every morning. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, they kind of got you.  They fucking do, man.  You know, then you got the condo maintenance fee, whatever the hell...  Why?  So they can open the door for me in the morning?  Who cares?  I can open my own door.  Well, and now enjoy your...  We were talking about all the taxes yesterday.  Yesterday, yeah.  The federal and state taxes.  Yeah.  Well, you can now enjoy the city taxes, which they are looking now to up for people that  make over $250,000 a year.  So it's not only the federal and the state. 
[00:12:00]  Now New York City is also joining the club of let's tax everybody that makes over $250,000.  Instead of solving the real problems, which is, once again, mismanagement.  Yeah.  That's going to be a word we're going to use a lot in the coming year or two.  So mismanagement, it's everywhere.  And there's some woman I heard, some fucking politician, and her whole goal is to get people  to stop paying taxes that she deems don't make enough. 
[00:12:30]  And she goes, that could save them $300 a year.  And it's like, well, that sounds all well and fine, but that's a buck a day, not even  a dollar a day.  Why would you take that, you know, let them pay their buck a day.  It'll help the city out.  Yeah.  It'll help the system.  And don't tax the shit out of everybody else.  I think if you can't afford a buck a day, you know.  Yeah.  You might want to leave the city.  Right.  Exactly.  Maybe Manhattan is India.  You're not cut out to live in Manhattan. 
[00:13:00]  I understand the little guy's plight, but if you can't afford a dollar a day, come on.  What are you doing?  It's less than a dollar a day, by the way.  Yeah, it is.  Obviously, if it's $300 a year.  Perhaps less than that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, two more days left in this joint.  Yeah.  It feels like we're getting fired, but we're not.  We're just going down the building.  I know.  It just feels very.  I was thinking of it when I'm driving in.  I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to have to take home a different way.  I don't know which way to go. 
[00:13:30]  It's like all sinking in now that like, oh, got to get out of here.  It's like moving, you know, when you move from your house and you kind of put it, put  things off.  You put it, put off packing and things like that until the last minute.  And then you realize, oh, this is it.  I'm leaving.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's weird.  It's sad.  There's always changes with us.  I hate change.  It's like so confusing.  Change stinks.  A mere month ago, we were broadcasting from two studios starting next week. 
[00:14:00]  It's a new studio.  New studio.  That we don't even know.  I know.  It's like we just get moved around.  We're gypsies.  We're the gypsies of radio.  We just pick up our stuff.  We don't have a spot because we know it's temporary always.  It's always temporary with us.  Tina.  Gypsies.  Oh, yeah.  Right, right.  I die when I turn my lips.  In my mouth.  In my mouth.  Yeah.  In my mouth. 
[00:14:30]  At this point, we're just saying yes to everybody.  We gave up trying to organize our show for the last couple of days.  Yeah.  Today, we got Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa, Jay Moore, and Doug Stanhope all stopping by.  Oh, good.  Doug's chumming.  It's our own variety show.  We've been trying to organize, believe it or not, and kind of spread this out.  But now it's like, yeah, you want to combine and say hi?  Sure.  Why not?  So those people, and I think maybe some more surprises.  Tomorrow, I saw Saget last night.  Is Saget coming in tomorrow?  He's in tomorrow, yeah.  All right, so we add him to tomorrow's schedule, which is already ridiculous. 
[00:15:00]  Hey, are you sad that they're taking guiding light off the air?  I am so angry at this.  I'm starting a letter writing campaign to keep the guiding light on.  It has been one of my favorite shows since it came out 72 years ago.  72 years.  I remember catching that first episode on the radio.  It was a radio serial.  When you were just particles in the universe?  Yes.  You were checking out guiding light? 
[00:15:30]  It was a radio show first.  Was it called?  With those people that just stood in front of the big lights, in front of the big microphones.  Yeah.  And stuff, and they're like, yes, guiding light.  Was it called guiding light back then?  Yes.  I guess so.  Jimmy said, I bet you there's someone out there that has watched every episode since 1978.  And I'm thinking...  78?  72 years ago?  No, it's 1937.  It became a radio show.  No, but he's saying from 78, it's like, he's saying there's probably people out there  that haven't missed an episode in the last 30 plus years.  Oh, yeah.  And I say that goes way higher. 
[00:16:00]  I bet you there's some 90-year-olds out there that haven't missed this show in 50, 60 years.  What are they attributing it to?  Low ratings, I would gather.  The whole world's changing.  That's what they're contributing it to.  They don't care about a guiding light?  Nah.  I wish we could get Stumper on the phone.  His wife worked for one of these big soaps.  She was a big writer for one of these.  Was it guiding light?  I don't know which one it was.  What about the sands through the hourglass?  The days of our lives.  The days of our lives. 
[00:16:30]  Well, Travis has the original radio intro.  Oh, to guiding light?  Yes.  72 years ago?  All Skate.  The guiding light.  Brought to you by the makers of P&G Soap.  The White Master Soap.  The what?  The White Master Soap?  What?  That was a long time ago.  Did it say White Master Soap?  No, I don't think it did. 
[00:17:00]  What did it say?  White What?  I thought it said White Master Soap.  So did I.  And you said it.  Let me hear that again.  Just the end or whatever.  I like that organ.  I want.  The guiding light.  That's for us.  That's for us.  Brought to you by the makers of P&G Soap.  The White Master Soap.  The White?  The White Master Soap. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know.  Something.  What was going on 72 years ago?  Oh, my God.  The White Master Soap show 72 years.  Oh, my God.  What was happening in 72 years?  What year was that?  37.  Oh, 37?  Well, one of our favorite world leaders was just getting geared up.  Isn't that amazing?  He was just revving up.  Yeah, he was just revving up his war machine.  It went until 52 on the radio.  15 minute show.  Then from 52 to 50-something hours.  It was on TV 15 minutes.  And then it went to half hour. 
[00:18:00]  In 68, why do I know all this?  And then 77, it became a one-hour series.  Do you really know that?  I read it last night.  Oh, I thought you were just being Jimmy the Liar.  No, no.  That's all true.  I actually read it last night.  Oh.  It's the White Naptha Soap.  What the hell is that?  N-A-P-T-H-A.  Yes.  For white people.  That's how old that show is.  The distinct, you know, words have been changed out of our vocabulary. 
[00:18:30]  That frigging horror organ.  Yeah.  By the way, if Kevin from Connecticut is writing this on Instant Feedback, I guess we can finally  tell people that Stunt Brain has landed on his feet.  He's going to be working for Montel Williams.  Oh, really?  I knew that.  Why did I say, oh, really?  And Air America.  Air America, they're like rolling out a Montel Williams show and they got Stunt Brain.  Really?  We wish him nothing but the best.  We were hoping he was going to continue with us, to be honest with you.  I know how liberal he is.  Oh, what a fucking horrible mix that's going to be. 
[00:19:00]  I forgot.  That fiscal prick.  It'll be a nice little chemistry thing there.  Have fun.  He'll do fine.  I'll tell you one thing.  The guiding light is the first time I wanted to fuck Hayden Panetaria.  Is that how you say it?  Oh, yeah.  Hayden Panetaria.  What was she saying?  No, I don't remember.  I just remember watching and going, she was hot.  She was in that show?  Yes.  She was very cute.  She was one of the big stars that started on there?  Yeah.  They had a lot of celebrities started on that show.  They're doing an hour a day of different material five days a week. 
[00:19:30]  It's fucking mind-boggling.  Let's see who was on there.  How is that?  We do four.  It's not TV.  We don't.  Ah, TV's easy.  Stand here.  Stand here.  Read this card.  Okay, let's move the lights.  Dramatic left shoulder turns.  Let's see.  James Earl Jones.  These are a few people that were on the guiding light over the years.  All right.  Kevin Bacon.  Missed Cicely Tyson.  Ruby Dee.  Mira Servino.  Wow. 
[00:20:00]  Taye Diggs.  Calista Flockhart.  And, of course, hero star Hayden Panetrarium.  What did, like, Ruby Dee and Cicely Tyson, what were they on, like, the 60s or the 70s?  Probably, yeah.  Cicely Tyson was famous in the 70s.  Miss Cicely Tyson.  Yeah.  Didn't she play Miss Jane Pittman?  Yeah.  The autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.  And they put that makeup on her, make her look all old and shit. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, you guys want to know what was happening in 1937?  All righty.  Do we know our audience or what?  We start the show talking about a soap opera.  Yeah, I know.  We rule.  Let's see.  January 19th of that year, 1937.  Howard Hughes sets a new record by flying from L.A. to New York City.  Oh, no.  How many hours do you think?  L.A. to New York City, 1937.  L.A. to New York, 1937.  I'm giving it 12 hours.  7 hours, 28 minutes, 25 seconds. 
[00:21:00]  Wow.  That's fast.  Franklin D. Roosevelt was sworn in for a second term.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's see.  Yes.  Ohio River floods.  I'm looking for stuff there.  You could drink in a whites-only fountain.  Oh, I see.  Someone's got to go through this because it goes month by month.  This will take forever to figure out.  Cigarettes were good for you. 
[00:21:30]  27 issues later, Detective Comics introduces Batman.  No one was a hobo.  Just close friends and roommates, right?  Yes.  Right.  Close friends.  Look at these two bachelors ladies.  They live together.  What a catch they would be.  They keep a clean apartment and their snappy dresses.  And look, they do their own decorating. 
[00:22:00]  They never acknowledged that they were Moe's.  Look at these two bachelors ladies.  Ladies?  They're quite a catch.  Was it they didn't acknowledge or they just didn't?  I don't know if they didn't know.  I have no idea.  We've got to get some old dude on the phone to talk about that.  Did people know?  I don't know.  I mean, people are very aware these days.  But back then, did he just look the other way?  They're good friends. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Here they are having a gay time out.  Yeah.  Because gay means happy and fun, not a dick in the ass.  Everyone walked around like Regis, just clueless.  Yeah.  Someone might be a homosexual.  A homosexual.  The homosexual is a predator.  You must guard your children against the homosexual.  His perversities will get into every aspect of your life and that of your children. 
[00:23:00]  They were afraid of the homosexual back then.  Wow.  Yeah.  The pot smoker, the homosexual.  These were all just dangerous people.  We used to think the hole in the bathroom stall was to pass toilet paper through when  a buddy needed some.  Who invented that?  Hey, Mac, hand over a couple.  I have to wipe my ass.  There is a guy out there that invented that.  That's right.  Who cut the first hole?  That's what I'm saying.  I know who it is, actually. 
[00:23:30]  Ted Glory.  Good old Ted.  Ted Glory.  I sure want to love to suck a penis.  Jesus, Ted.  Pesky walls.  Hey, fella.  Wait a minute.  If I break my drill in, I can peek.  Ted Glory.  He, uh...  That is...  They probably didn't know what it was for.  They had no idea.  They just thought it was shoddy workmanship back then. 
[00:24:00]  It's a hole doing in here.  But someone just...  Goodness.  Could you pass me a lucky through that?  Boy, you are lucky.  And now so am I.  Do you think the guy that did that is aware that he invented that?  I don't know.  Or it was just one of those things, and now that guy ended up walking the earth not knowing  he invented the glory hole.  That was the first one.  Someone had to be the first one to cut the hole in there.  Yep.  It's like, well, we're getting in trouble here in the lavatory.  We try to have sex inside a stall, but people walk in and they see four legs and realize,  hey, this is a problem. 
[00:24:30]  So I decided I'm just going to get my hole saw and drill a hole in there.  And now we could be in our respective stalls and still suck dick.  It's a glorious time.  Maybe it was Gus and Elmer.  Gus and Elmer.  You think Elmer and Gus were the first ones?  Elmer and Gus.  Look, ladies.  They're not taken.  They're saving themselves for the perfect gal.  One with a penis.  Let's go to Chris in the Poconos. 
[00:25:00]  Everyone attempting their 30s voice right now.  Chris, what's up?  Back when pedophiles were just friends in a family.  Yeah, they didn't know about that either.  Yeah, I know.  It was always somebody that would drive up.  They'd tell you, you know, look out, kids.  Someone might ask you if you want some candy or if you need a ride.  Stay away from these people.  They could mean you harm.  Meanwhile, uncles are just plowing away on fucking nieces and nephews.  Up in the attic room.  That could never happen. 
[00:25:30]  Down in the basement.  In the nooks and crannies of your house.  Yes.  Evil was all over.  Yeah, the little dark areas of the house.  They did not know any better back then.  Let's go to Rochester.  Hey, are we...  Oh, Rochester.  Are we voting for Brother Weezer's show?  I think they're doing that March Madness again.  Or did we run it for?  I hope we didn't forget.  To push everyone toward their radio fucking contest up there.  Their radio fucking contest.  Well, no one happened right there? 
[00:26:00]  What?  I thought we were on regular radio for a second.  That's happened to me a couple of times until you throw out the first FU.  I just realized, I'm like, oh, right, we can curse.  Yeah.  Yeah, every once in a while it just hits me.  It's weird because I think we start out not cursing right off the bat.  Yeah, because we're used to not cursing between like six and, I don't know, whatever, nine.  Yeah.  Whatever the hell it was.  Yeah.  Until somebody curses.  Because a couple of times I've just been sitting here and either you or Jim have thrown out an F-bomb or the S-bomb. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  And I'm like, whoa.  You're taking it back for a second.  Yeah, the pause was because I wasn't sure.  Oh, yeah, we can curse.  I don't know.  If that's still happening, maybe someone could help us out and tell us how we vote for Wheeze to win that whole damn thing again.  What do you got, Todd?  Hey, what's going on?  Oh, hey, man.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  Cool, man.  Well, the Napsa soap, yeah, it's an old person thing.  You know, my grandmother uses it from back in, you know, she's like almost 80 now.  But it was passed on to my grandmother and it's more of a yellow color now, but they swear by it and they don't use anything. 
[00:27:00]  It's like an old people's shout or spray and wash.  It gets out stains and crap.  Oh, it's for clothes and stuff, not their body.  Yeah, it's just an ugly yellow bar of soap she keeps in a plastic bag in the closet.  It's really disgusting.  Oh, God, there's new things.  And I bet you that soap's been around, the bar you're talking about, since 1937.  Naptha.  It never goes away.  They knew how to make stuff back then where it, you know, you could use it forever.  All right, more 30s voices coming. 
[00:27:30]  Ah, let's see.  Steve, Long Island.  Yes.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  You boys are also forgetting that back in the day you could walk around as an elderly woman  and not get your hat knocked off your head by a Negro.  Frankus.  Hey, your hat.  Your hat is safe, ladies.  The big dumb I Love Lucy hats.  Kevin from Connecticut, 1930s voice.  I don't feel like doing this. 
[00:28:00]  You want to do the 30s voice?  I can't do the 30s voice.  Oh, no, I can't read from there.  Oh, you don't have an instant feedback?  I don't have the instant feedback.  It hasn't been invented yet.  Make sure you hide your young daughter away if she shows any sign of a baby bump.  Yes.  She has to be sent to a convent.  They would do nasty things.  They just set up towns.  She's away at school.  Yeah.  She's at boarding school.  That must have been a hell of a town.  You're a slut daughter.  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  You hear about the town every once in a while.  Yeah, they would set up like just the town of pregnant little teens.  Oh, when my mom was younger and she got pregnant, they sent her away.  Yeah.  Where?  That would be a pretty cool town to visit.  Down the basement steps first.  Yeah.  That didn't take.  It would be an awful town.  A bunch of fat fucking chicks who were knocked up.  Lactating.  Just eating pickles and ice cream all day long.  Back in the olden days.  What did that rumor start?  Pickles and ice cream.  Big nasty hair.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  God damn.  The good old days.  Mm-hmm.  1937.  For the guiding light.  All right.  Oh.  Yeah, I saw this in the paper.  We got the audio.  This is a good little story.  A guy got pulled over for being drunk.  Uh-huh.  Did you hear about this one?  I'm keeping it vague because I want it to be all nice when people hear this.  On the, uh...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did.  Along the byways of Newark, Ohio, Kyle Weigel was puttering along on this homemade contraption. 
[00:29:30]  A motorized bar stool.  Then the accident happened.  911 Center.  Yes.  566 Kelly Lane.  We're sending a squad over there for a gentleman who wrecked him a motorized bar stool and had  head laceration and he's got alcohol on board.  All right.  When the police got there, they ticketed Weigel for OVI, operating a motor vehicle under the  influence.  We had a bar stool with a, sat over top of a motor and it was bolted to the frame.  It was just an accident. 
[00:30:00]  I mean, a little minor accident.  But the police report says Weigel admitted to driving drunk after more than a dozen beers.  A strange sight for one witness.  It seemed to me like he was standing up, but I guess you were sitting on a bar stool.  For now, the rolling bar stool sits grounded in Kyle Weigel's garage.  That's why I don't drive it no more.  They say necessity is the mother of invention.  Why not get from point A to point B on a bunch of lawnmower parts running at 40 miles per hour, 
[00:30:30]  topped off by a bar stool?  Just don't do it drunk.  As Kyle Weigel found out from the Newark, Ohio police, the hard way.  Wow, that is a sure sign that you're drunk.  Yeah.  That's not a real clever thing to do on a bar stool.  Drive a bar stool.  Actually, I think it's kind of clever.  I think the guy has a sense of humor.  He's like, what the hell?  He probably figured he could get away with it.  Is that a motorized bar stool?  That's not the bar stool guy, right?  There's a guy in my neighborhood that does the same thing. 
[00:31:00]  No way.  I swear.  I saw him flying down the street one day.  I was like, wow.  I was like, that's pretty cool.  Pretty dangerous.  You're a little top heavy.  And it was a lawnmower with some kind of a bar stool?  It looked exactly like that.  That's awesome.  So they've been making these for a while, obviously.  I guess the Rednecks figured this one out a while ago.  The motorized bar stool making its way.  Sorry to the Rednecks, but you don't really see them,  this type of thing up here.  No, no.  I mean, Danny saw one, but I've never seen this in my life.  No, it's called the Segway now is pretty much what the... 
[00:31:30]  Dude, I saw a Segway in a mall the other day.  Yeah.  That is the most ridiculous thing ever.  Isn't it?  I know we've all seen the Segway, but we haven't seen him recently  because I think they banned him in New York City or something.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  I was in a mall down in Philly, and the guy tools by,  he looked like the biggest idiot.  Oh, the stand-up things?  Yeah, I couldn't take a picture fast enough because he flew by me.  Why wouldn't you just walk?  Do you go faster on the Segway?  Yeah, you'd probably go a little faster.  Why do you have to go fast in a mall if you're a mall cop or one of those things? 
[00:32:00]  You've got to get to the scene of the crime.  That's right.  They do security.  People use them and stuff.  It looks ridiculous.  Yeah.  There's a chimp.  There's two chimps riding.  Segways?  Of course, it's from Japan.  Look, two chimps are riding Segways.  Oh, my God.  Danny, how did they get that video?  It's so cute.  I think you have to Google.  It's funny.  Just Google.  Just Google.  Segway?  They're just a chimp. 
[00:32:30]  Chimp riding Segway.  Chimp riding Segway.  On YouTube.  Ripping off someone's face.  She's responding, by the way, that lady.  Huh?  The lady.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That got her face ripped off.  Yeah.  I'm sure she's happy she's responding.  Yeah, she's going, ow.  She's like, I'm still not in heaven?  Great.  What is it going to take?  They actually put a helmet on the chimp.  Yeah.  That's riding the Segway.  You could take that frigging monkey head and smash it into a concrete wall, and it's not  going to hurt.  Yeah, those things fall out of trees on there, man. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, the helmet.  Their skulls are thick.  You don't have to worry about a chimp needing a helmet.  Let me go to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  You take this one.  Hey, guys.  There's a company out.  There's a V8 underneath it.  You can buy it as a kit, or you can buy it completely assembled.  But it's like 20 grand with the whole, with it assembled.  20 grand?  Yeah, what the hell?  That should be like a $5,000 vehicle.  Tops.  The one more thing?  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  With a V8, though.  How fast does that go?  A V8?  Yeah, it's got a V8.  It's all hydraulic driven.  They monitor the speed with the hydraulics, but they say it'll go like 25, but I bet you  you could change that around.  It'd probably run 100.  Why would you put a V8 in something that only does 25 miles an hour?  You could put a Briggs & Stratton five-horse power motor.  Don't they modify lawnmowers and have races?  Yeah.  Don't they?  You can go on their website and see it.  All right.  We'll take a look at that.  Thanks, sir.  Yes, we'll get right on it.  Yeah.  Let's get Andy in North Carolina. 
[00:34:00]  Andy!  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  The cops in Goldsboro now are driving, are using the Segways now.  They are?  Why?  It was in the paper.  Why would they use a Segway?  They said that it's better for patrolling, I guess.  Better than what?  Better than a car? 
[00:34:30]  I think they're trying to save gas or something.  Yeah?  Are they?  Are they really?  Could you put your mom on the phone?  I hope this poor guy just gets blasted about that voice every day.  He tries to call in.  You might want to pull your testicles out of your abdomen.  Jesus, dude.  What's up with the voice?  We've got to ask.  Yeah, what's going on?  What are you working at? 
[00:35:00]  Helium factory?  Ted's.  Helium.  Ted's Porium.  Emporium.  My life's going to be high, Anthony.  It makes me sound a feather.  Andy, what do you got?  What's up with the voice?  Andy, what's going on?  It's just my voice.  How old are you?  I'm 29.  Wow.  Do you get, like, do you get shit on the phone all the time?  Yeah, actually, I do.  People call me myth.  Yeah, that's going to suck, man. 
[00:35:30]  Fuck me, miss.  Hi, miss.  And what do you say when someone goes, hello, miss?  Yes.  What do you go?  What do you say?  It's a guy.  How do you respond to that?  I just let go.  It's been happening so long.  He's depressed.  And then they go, oh, I'm sorry, sir.  And then you hear him chuckle in the background. 
[00:36:00]  People call me miss is the name of a great biography.  Yeah, people call me miss.  But a guy who murders eight people.  Should just, like, swallow some razor blades or something.  Yeah, scratch that shit up a little bit.  Do you smoke?  Not anymore.  I quit.  Nah, you should take it back up, dude.  Yeah.  Well worth the risk of cancer to get the rasp back in your throat.  Do some camels, no filter.  Yeah, do that.  And chug some bourbon for breakfast.  Yeah, yeah, booze. 
[00:36:30]  You're right.  Do you drink?  Um, no.  Oh, shit.  Are you depressed that we brought up your voice?  You don't drink, don't smoke.  What do you do?  Miss, we're talking to you.  Oh, I look nice.  Yes, come on, miss.  Respond.  Stupid cunt.  I look nice.  That's what I do.  Hey, did you know that Anthony was kind of giving your voice a teasing the moment he went  into his high pitch?  Yes, I noticed.  This poor guy is so depressed.  This guy hates when people point out his voice. 
[00:37:00]  Is there anything they could do about that?  I mean, like, what kind of vocal cord surgery?  Yeah.  Because you really, that's got to stink, dude.  I swear to God, I'd get so pissed.  You're on the phone every time and it's like, hello, miss.  Miss.  Hey, call me miss.  Not even missus or, it's not even, it's voices like that of a little girl.  Yeah.  All right, Andy, we're going to let you go.  All right.  Bye.  Andy, come on.  We love it.  All right, Andy. 
[00:37:30]  Hang in there, Andy.  Take care.  Oh, poor guy.  Let's go to Dave in New York.  Dave.  Hey, I'm warning you, buddy.  There's a man on the phone.  Hey, Dave.  How are you?  That's a man.  Good.  It's actually Dave the truck driver out of Rock Street, New York.  You met me once, Opie.  We brought the horses down for a wheeze.  I remember that, sure.  Around 9-11.  We're a little after that, aren't we?  The motorized barstool is bar fly.  They've had them in Florida, Fort Lauderdale for years.  We had one up at the creekside up in Russia, New York.  We had to get rid of it because everybody kept getting hurt and falling over. 
[00:38:00]  One guy almost hit the front end of a big truck.  It was horrendous.  It looks very top-heavy and very unstable.  I think the key is to make sure the barstool is not too high.  Yeah, you don't want a big, tall barstool.  You want a squat barstool.  You've got to saw the legs off a little bit.  But the cool thing is, if it's a tall barstool, then it looks silly.  Yeah.  If it's too short, it just looks like you're sitting on a lawnmower.  Right.  Why not just sit on a lawnmower?  You've got to have a regular side barstool.  Right.  Or get a car.  Or get a car, exactly.  Sure. 
[00:38:30]  All right, Dave.  Thank you so much.  The whole Escalade-Weed Whacker combination.  Unnecessary.  Let's go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Yeah, that motorized barstool.  I've had those like since the 70s and 80s.  I had probably show Incredible People that used to come on.  Oh, yes.  Incredible People.  Or what was it?  No, it was Real People.  Real People and Those Amazing Animals and Incredible Douchebags.  That's Incredible.  That's Incredible.  Yes, it was That's Incredible. 
[00:39:00]  Real People.  Real People.  Real People and Amazing Animals.  Yeah.  That was the same niche shows like they do now with Dancing with the Stars and American Idol.  And you know, that was that type of show where they would just show clips of things.  That you can now see on YouTube.  YouTube.  So it pretty much made those shows obsolete.  How old are we?  My God.  Robin.  Wait, who was on That's Incredible?  Was it Fran Tarkenton?  Fran was incredible.  Fran Tarkenton.  Fran Tarkenton.  Who was the broad?  Minnesota Vikings own? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, Fran Tarkenton.  It wasn't Kathy Lee Gifford, right?  No, it was Kathy Lee Crosby.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Good memory.  Very good.  Yes.  Very good.  Who was that other guy that was like a David Letterman wannabe back then?  I don't know.  And on the other one, it was Sarah Purcell, Skip Stevenson, and John-  Maybe Skip Stevenson.  John Davidson.  John Davidson.  John Davidson.  That was Real People.  That was Real People.  And Byron Allen.  Byron Allen was on that?  Yes, he was.  Really?  I almost paused.  That guy doesn't age, huh?  Well, yeah. 
[00:40:00]  He just gets rich.  He buys all this shit.  Byron Allen is one of the fucking richest guys ever.  Really?  Well, yeah.  I mean, maybe not the little boy's wife saying he has a lot of money.  All the money in the world he has.  Little boy's wife.  Let's say hi to Robin in Detroit, a regular of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Robin.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hi.  Michigan State or what?  Let's do a little basketball real fast.  Michigan State fan.  Michigan State's in and they're playing here, so everybody's pumped up.  All right.  Well, that's what I was asking.  All right, Robin.  What do you got? 
[00:40:30]  But there's a company that actually makes coolers that you drive because you see them  in all the redneck crap here in Michigan, but it's an actual cooler.  It's like a mini bike.  All right, look, Andy, don't call back with a different name, okay?  She's got a deeper voice than Andy, though.  Although the joke was very good.  Yeah, she does.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen that cooler with the, that kind of looks pretty good.  You can drive your cooler around and drink your beer and then drive some more.  You could call the outdoor stuff, you know? 
[00:41:00]  I like that it's barstools and coolers, things that you're drinking and then motorized vehicles.  Yeah, but it's just silly stuff.  Yeah, it's silly past the time.  All the unemployed autoworkers can get one of those.  It's not like a real vehicle.  You'd think they go into court with a Dewey on one of those and it's the same as if you  were driving a vehicle down the highway.  I bet you it is, unfortunately.  I bet they get a good laugh about it, though.  No, I bet they get a good laugh and go, ah, okay, we're just going to plead it down  to this crap.  Hey, Robin, is the city falling apart with the whole car crisis? 
[00:41:30]  It's a fucking nightmare.  Really?  I think everybody I know is unemployed.  Really?  Wow.  I mean, my boyfriend hasn't worked in three months.  He's a car hauler.  He'll probably never go back to work.  Jesus.  What do you mean he'll never go back to work?  He's got to find something else to do, no?  No, he doesn't at this point.  I mean, he can drive over the road, but car haulers, their jobs are gone pretty much.  No, I understand that, but he'll get into something else.  You know, I haven't seen many car haulers on the highway.  That's a really good expressway.  That's a good indication because driving around, you see them all over the place. 
[00:42:00]  Well, I mean, you'd look up and go, oh, yeah, new cars and new Jeeps.  I'm glad they're not on the highway anymore.  Why?  Scary.  Yeah, those cars bouncing.  You're like, come on.  That's going to bounce off that truck.  Yeah, they're so precariously perched on those things.  And, like, it looks like one is just going to bash the roof into the other one.  I don't know how they figured that shit out.  Well, you'd be surprised how many times they forget to put down the ramps and they'll hit 
[00:42:30]  bridges and cars fall off all the time.  See, thank you.  That's nice.  That's my worry, and it does happen.  That's when they get on the parkway.  When they're loading the car on the top of the cab, they drive them right off into the  parking lot.  It's a nightmare.  So what are people doing for money?  Is the town turning into zombies?  Well, this town was shit before, but it's just a disaster.  There's some parts of Detroit.  I was looking online.  Man, I saw some YouTube videos and stuff of Detroit that are just all boarded up houses 
[00:43:00]  that are turned into crack houses and burnt out neighborhoods, entire neighborhoods that  are just burnt out to the ground.  Yeah, and it's been like that for a long time.  It's just really getting worse by the day.  I mean, it's depressing.  Well, the electric car will save Detroit.  Oh, it will.  I know.  Yeah, the electric car.  That's why you can't have a town or a city built on one industry, man.  As soon as that industry goes away, it is bad news.  People didn't learn from the gold rush pretty much proved that that happens. 
[00:43:30]  When all the gold was gone, the people leave.  So you got the auto industry based in Detroit, and that was it.  But most of those people are stuck there because they don't want to leave their families and friends.  And now you can't.  You get into a situation where you can't leave.  You don't have the money to.  Your whole life, the life of your father, your grandfather,  they all worked in the same place.  And, you know, pretty much just ingrained in them to do that kind of work.  What are you going to do? 
[00:44:00]  Move down south and become a farmer?  All the years that it was good, you know, they spent money like crack whores,  and now they have nothing.  But, you know, it's a theme on our show lately.  How does the car industry fall apart?  There's cars everywhere.  I know that people aren't buying new cars.  I understand that part of it.  And overseas probably imports, right?  But how do they let that happen?  Yeah.  How do you let that happen?  I heard a stat that was just, like, really astounding to me. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  In order for Chrysler to be profitable,  they have to sell something like 12 million cars a year.  12 million cars.  That's, like, a good year.  Right.  That's, like, good.  And if they sell five, they're, like, fucked.  Right.  That's five million cars.  What if they sell 11 million?  They're still doing good, I think.  Yeah.  Even when they sold a lot of cars,  they were just digging themselves in a hole anyway. 
[00:45:00]  Even when things were, quote, unquote, good,  they were just slowly going down the drain.  Mismanagement.  Mismanagement.  Union troubles.  Well, you know, it's like...  Mismanagement.  Opie's right about building a town on one industry.  You can't...  Fishkill New York is devastated  because their whole town...  Oh, God.  Sorry, Jim.  No, I'm saying that they were built.  The whole fucking thing was structured around  welcome to 2009 hats.  And then...  Well, the only thing is you got to... 
[00:45:30]  No, right.  You got to write it with a fact.  Wow.  Robin, you've listened to this show long enough  to know that that wasn't time  for a little cute fact from you.  They didn't want streamers.  They didn't want noisemakers.  They said, just the hats with the year on them.  They're like, it'll keep us going forever.  And there was a council meeting  where one guy goes,  what about 2010?  And they're like,  down, sit down.  No, no.  2009.  Yeah.  Remove that guy.  He's crazy.  What's...  Hold on.  What's that steamroller? 
[00:46:00]  We didn't hear you.  God almighty.  You got to give her a break.  Her whole life's falling apart.  No, my life is great.  She's a week away from a bread line.  Give her a little slack.  You know what?  My job's sending out collection letters,  so we're hiring people.  What do you do?  Oh, great.  You're one of those.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so you're busy.  Yeah.  I'm busier than a one-arm paper hanger.  Wow.  What?  Move.  Holy shit.  One-arm paper hanger? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  How is that busy?  Yeah.  I love you guys.  Oh, God.  All right, Ronald.  We're going to give you some slack.  Somebody, the first time I heard that...  I feel like a one-legged man  in an ass-kicking contest right about now.  My father would say that.  Would he?  Yeah.  And my father actually does have one leg.  And he would enter ass-kicking contests all the time,  and they would go,  you're disqualified, sir,  because you have one leg.  You know, I bet they'd be good at it.  Yeah.  Like, one-legged people, 
[00:47:00]  you see them do all kinds of things.  I bet they'd do this jump-kick thing  and just kick you in the ass with that one leg.  How can you be good at that?  I bet they would be.  Somebody once said what I was...  The first time I heard that expression,  this guy was,  I was busier than a one-arm wallpaper hanger  with crabs,  and that made me laugh.  Oh, see, that's funny,  because he can't scratch his dick.  He's trying to hold up the wallpaper.  Hold on, sorry.  What, Robin?  You're busier than a nine-vocal-corded man. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yes, I do.  You don't, you never shut your yap, do you?  You don't get to talk much, do you?  No, I'm in customer service,  so I talk all the time.  Yeah, but people then think you're like a bitch,  and they hang up on you.  No, they don't.  Just like, we're gonna...  Do you follow a script every day?  Do I?  No, I don't.  You don't?  No, no script.  Come on.  All right, Robin.  I make up my own fun.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Robin.  Okay.  All right, we're gonna go to Matt in Wisconsin. 
[00:48:00]  Matt.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up, Matt?  Hey, I got a...  One of my best friends  has a riding lawnmower  that he races nationally.  It'll do 90 miles an hour.  Nice.  I knew that they were doing this.  On a lawnmower.  Someone was saying it's the Nitro  something, something,  something, something.  Really, like, funny car?  U.S. LMA or something?  Yeah.  He goes all over the country.  LMA, the United States Lawnmower Association. 
[00:48:30]  He goes M-A?  He goes across...  Is there really a lawnmower association?  He goes across the country?  Wouldn't that just be a local thing you do?  Yeah, you would think.  It started off as a local thing,  but he goes all over the country  and does it now.  And he goes 90 miles an hour  in a lawnmower.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's a 14-and-a-half horse  Briggs & Stratton  that he's got all juiced up with...  I mean, it's been blueprinted  and polished  and it hauls ass, man.  Nice.  Boring out of... 
[00:49:00]  I guess little...  There it is.  There it is.  And they dress like NASCAR guys.  Yeah, look at this.  Without the sponsorships.  That is foolish.  That is just foolish looking.  They're all dressed...  Look at them.  They're racing.  It looks like motocross almost.  Yeah.  Yeah, the cool thing about it  is they start off Le Mans style.  They line them all up  across the track.  Ah, and they got to run  to the lawnmower.  Yeah, yeah.  Start them up and go.  It's actually pretty cool.  I was like, 
[00:49:30]  oh, dude, you are a hillbilly.  You are not racing lawnmowers.  And he was like,  oh, you got to come check it out.  And they got V-twins, actually,  that sound like big V-8s.  You know, they got  all different kinds of classes.  Jesus.  It's crazy, man.  It's crazy.  Do they force them  to cut the grass during the race?  No, no.  Some farmer should just go,  yeah, you can use my lawn.  I mean, if you're using a lawnmower  but it's not cutting grass,  is it a lawnmower?  Is it a lawnmower?  For real.  Or have they turned it  into some race vehicle?  Yeah, for real.  Let's keep it old school 
[00:50:00]  and you have to cut the grass  as you're racing.  I'm sure the blades are gone.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, they do have a class.  No, they should force the blades  to still be on the thing.  Absolutely.  Fucking mulch.  Yeah, in case there's  some fine wreck.  Where one turns over  and a guy gets thrown off  and just falls into the blades.  Yeah, just keeps it a little...  Keeps it interesting  for everybody.  I'd watch that.  All right there, Matt.  Thanks for the knowledge.  Yep, have a good day, man.  All right.  Well, this guy,  Jeremy in Cleveland,  he's another regular.  Jeremy, what do you got going on? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, I got some redneck shit for you.  I took an 80cc engine  and put it on a regular  beach cruiser bicycle.  You pedal it,  let go of the clutch,  you could do about  50 miles an hour on it.  Wouldn't that just be  a motorcycle at that point?  Yeah, it's a motor bicycle.  It's a moped.  A moped, right.  Yeah, but it's not  like the standard moped.  Like, you know,  it's on a regular bicycle.  I can pedal it too  besides using the engine.  All right.  I've seen little engines  that they put on bicycles  and it like has a little roller  that goes on the tire. 
[00:51:00]  Sure, sure.  And you flip it down  and just go wah.  Remember the old Wizards?  No.  I do.  Look up the old Wizards bikes.  It looks kind of just like that  except it's a little more faster  and they'll drive it.  All right.  I remember seeing  a little Peugeot  motorized bicycle.  It's like a moped.  It was like one of the first  mopeds by Peugeot.  That's kind of cool.  Let's say hi to Charlie  in Staten Island.  He might turn us on  to a pretty cool video.  That looks like something  that you ride.  Looks like Peugeot's bike.  My bike!  My bike!  Something you would ride 
[00:51:30]  in Vietnam.  In the Nam.  In the Nam.  Let's go to Charlie.  Speaking of Nam.  Hey, good morning.  There's a YouTube video  on YouTube  of a guy riding  his lawnmower home  drunk  and he gets pulled over  and he gives the cop  a hard time  and they wind up hazing him.  I've seen that one.  You've seen that one?  Is it a good one?  It's all right.  It's pretty good.  I've seen every tasing video.  You've got to get past Danny.  It's fake.  It's a fake one?  God, people still can't  figure out the fake videos, huh? 
[00:52:00]  I've never seen...  Sorry, I've never seen  HD dash cam footage.  HD.  It's real.  All right, sir.  Let's go to  Screwy Louie  in Buffalo.  Screwy Louie.  The Screwy Louie.  By the way,  get the word back  to Shred and Reagan.  15 years.  Actually, Shred,  15 years  in radio  in Buffalo.  Wow.  I keep getting scared  they're going to  screw that one up  and can those guys  do the way  the economy's going, 
[00:52:30]  you know?  They're the only thing  good around there.  You never know,  but Shred's been added  like 15 years.  Wow, I guess  I left Buffalo  15 years ago.  Yeah, I remember  before the  103.3 Fox days.  73 cents  in your pocket.  For real.  Just left.  No joke,  I had no money.  Took an old  steamer ship down  it.  Not that anyone cares,  but when I left Buffalo,  I literally had change.  Yeah.  And I went over  the Throg's neck.  What years were you there,  dude?  I paid the toll  in change.  You had to throw it  in the basket?  No joke.  No, no, no. 
[00:53:00]  Actually,  I had to open up  the U-Haul  and I had a huge  oversized beer bottle,  but it was like  a three-footer  and it was filled  with change.  That's all the money  I had in the world.  And I had to dump it out  to pay the guy.  You didn't know  you were going to be  going through some tolls  and perhaps you should  have thrown some  in the cab?  I forgot what happened.  I was broke.  And I was one of those  guys that had to pull over  and then deal with somebody.  Like, I could pay this toll.  Wait a minute.  And I opened up the...  I don't know.  Oh, I know why.  Because they got me  for the axles. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, right.  Because I was also...  I remember now  and I was also towing my car.  So I'm thinking,  what was the Throg's neck  back then?  Five, six bucks,  whatever?  I think I had like...  Per axle?  I think I had like  six bucks left.  So you're all set  and then they charge  you for axle?  I figure, all right,  over the Throg's neck  it's another hour  and then mommy and daddy  will take care of me  for a little while  until I get back  on my feet  with the new radio job.  Yeah.  And they're like,  no, it's whatever it was.  It's 16, 18 bucks.  I don't remember.  And they're like...  They go, pull over.  And then a guy  had to walk out  and then we're going 
[00:54:00]  through my change thing.  Your change?  Yeah, to pay the toll.  That was like 90...  I don't know, 92 maybe?  I probably was up  in Buffalo at the time  doing gigs  when you were up there  doing radio  and we just...  I wasn't doing radio up there  but I went there  and do the comedy club.  Jimmy, when are you  coming to the scene  up there in Buffalo?  I'm actually working  on getting something  in Buffalo done now.  Yeah, that's a great scene.  I'm dying to see you, man.  You do well in Buffalo.  Absolutely.  I think so too.  It's been years  since I've been up there.  Same act though.  Oh, without a doubt.  You have to get over. 
[00:54:30]  Just pretend  I'm not saying Clinton.  The whole Monica Lewinsky thing.  I'm trying to find  an Obama sex scandal  with a cigar  and make it topical again.  You know, we're laughing  but there are comedians  that do exactly that.  Kevin Dorni?  And they don't know  why they're not making it.  It's like,  how about you update your act,  you idiot?  I don't know how they do it.  How do you...  I don't know.  For all those years...  It's same exact 15, 20...  Bob Nelson?  I remember going to LA every...  Bob Nelson probably...  Is he still doing  the football player guy 
[00:55:00]  in the...  Probably, yeah.  Oof.  I remember going to LA  every year or two years  and you see the same comedians,  local guys at the comedy cellar.  You've been living your life  for the last year or two  and you go back  and the guy's doing  the exact same act  you saw last time  you were in LA.  And they're in LA  hoping like some big Hollywood guy  is going to come in  and discover them.  How is that ever going to happen?  Doing the same act for years.  Same dribble.  One thing that happens  in LA with comedians  is they get this,  I got to get my 7 to 10  industry set minutes  They call it the industry set?  Yeah, like,  let them see what you are.  Tell a story. 
[00:55:30]  So these guys are like,  you know,  I was driving a limo  for a few years  and they'll do like  a few minutes of that  so some show developer  can see that  and know that we can  build a show around this.  All right, look.  Sorry, Jimmy.  I heard you.  And people out there  in Radio Land heard you.  But Danny just found  a picture of Bob Nelson  and yeah, he's still...  It's recent.  Yeah, he's still doing  the football bit  because his hair  is all gray.  He looks like  Fran Tarkenton.  What?  Like, the current picture  of Fran Tarkenton.  What little hair  is left on his head 
[00:56:00]  is totally gray  and he's still doing  the bit with the  big shoulder pads  and the football helmet.  Holy shit.  Is anybody going  to see that  and laughing?  It was pretty funny  for the time.  I play football.  Yeah.  A mind is a terrible thing.  Right.  You remember?  I remember.  Yeah, sure do.  He used to be  the toast of the  Eastside Comedy Club  on Jericho Turnpike.  Wasn't he on the  big HBO special  where everybody made it?  He certainly was.  Yeah, he was a standout 
[00:56:30]  because everyone was...  You watched him doing that  for the first time.  The audience is fucking dying.  It was a good set.  Cracking up.  I remember seeing that  with my dad for the first time.  You remember where you were  when you saw certain bits?  Wait, wait.  Hey, go fuck yourself.  Screwy Louie.  They have a big picture  of Bob Nelson  in his football gear  over at like Governors.  Yeah.  It's hard to look at  when I go there.  He's so douchey.  Yeah, you just get  that douche chill.  I think he found God too 
[00:57:00]  or something.  I've never met Bob Nelson.  I heard he found God.  Good for him.  God bless.  God bless.  Have a good night.  Whatever it takes.  I was watching...  Danny stopped  by yesterday  and we were watching  douche chill-ish movie trailers  because I wanted to see  the trailer for Star Trek,  the latest one  for Star Trek movie  which looks really kick-ass.  Yeah.  And the new Terminator movie  with Christian Bale  looks fucking unbelievable.  Does it really?  Yeah.  It looks really cool.  Why are we surprised?  They're not going to make  a bad Terminator movie. 
[00:57:30]  And it's all...  Every movie that  Christian Bale's in now  starts with  forget what you've seen already  or forget the past  or that movie never existed.  It's a whole new retelling.  The guy is just...  And then it's...  And all action.  Yeah.  And Christian Bale  is doing a retelling  of the story  and you don't have to see  the other movies anymore.  Mm-hmm.  That's Christian Bale's gig now.  That's all he does. 
[00:58:00]  And we were laughing about  he should do it  to Back to the Future.  Where it's all really dramatic  and where he's having a fight  with Biff  and it's just...  He's completely kicking  the shit out of blood.  Real nasty  and then he shoots him  in the head or something.  Nice.  Forget what you've known  about Back to the Future.  Christian Bale  in the future.  They can just change it a little.  Upgrade the car.  It can't be a DeLorean anymore.  It has to be like  some electric Tesla hybrid. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Go with the Segway.  And it's got to go up to  like 188 miles an hour.  And it's just  warm up CGI  and shit through the highways.  Christian Bale  is Marty McFly.  You got to do  the Christian Bale voice.  Yeah.  Doc,  I don't know  how we going to get  that kind of power.  1.2 gigawatts of...  It's a retelling. 
[00:59:00]  That's pretty heavy, Doc.  That movie fucking stunk.  I don't know how  you guys like that.  Fantastic  and don't miss it.  It's...  Marvin Barry?  It's a terrible  fucking show.  They kind of forced  those lines out.  Hey!  Look what I got for you.  It's your cousin,  Marvin Barry?  Oh, Chuck's cousin.  Yes!  Gotcha!  Are you trying to tell me  that you built a time machine  out of a DeLorean? 
[00:59:30]  Ha ha ha!  Christian Bale  is Marty McFly  as you've never  seen him before.  Ha ha ha!  Doc!  No!  Ha ha ha!  Al-Qaeda terrorists!  They're after  the nuclear fuel!  We should just put  Christian Bale  in every movie  ever made.  Just put him in everything.  You remake it.  Right.  Put Christian Bale in it. 
[01:00:00]  Don't acknowledge  the previous movies.  Yeah.  And just a whole new retelling.  Screw it.  New Caddyshack  with Christian Bale?  Christian Bale is  Ty.  Ha ha ha!  Ty Webb  and The Shack.  They just kind of  changed the title.  Well, you gotta hip up  the name a little bit.  The kids like the hip names.  Ha ha ha!  Yeah, good point.  Blowing Fowls  from Cleveland.  I didn't see the third  Terminator movie.  I said they're not gonna  make a bad Terminator movie.  Was the third one horrible?  Dude, it was abysmally 
[01:00:30]  atrocious.  Yeah, I didn't see it.  Rated P-U.  Oh, hey!  It stunk  and I didn't like it.  It's not  with the chick?  Yeah.  I didn't hate it  but I didn't love it.  All right.  Let's go to 33 Across.  We got info on Bob Nelson.  33 Across.  What do you got?  Hi.  Hey, morning, guys.  I saw Bob Nelson  in Doylestown, Pennsylvania  like two weeks ago.  At the comedy?  Hold on, hold on.  Is it called a comedy?  It's a comedy club, right?  Yeah.  It's below or above 
[01:01:00]  a Mexican restaurant.  Whoa.  Poco Locos?  No, it's just called Pocos.  Oh, I got Poco Loco there  and Ransom.  And it was the same act  I saw when he was on HBO  like 25 years ago  and the picture they had  on like, you know,  the whatever it is,  it was the picture  from 25 years ago.  He looked absolutely  nothing like it.  Why would you do that  to yourself?  You know, if you're going  to be in entertainment,  you got to update those photos.  Because it just makes  you look bad.  Yeah, because you're  going to horrify your audience 
[01:01:30]  when you come walking out  with no hair.  Can I ask you a question, sir?  And what not?  Yes.  Why did you go  and see him?  Well, if you haven't  figured it out yet,  Doylestown, Pennsylvania  isn't exactly the comedy  capital of the world.  So you get what you get.  You know,  sounds like you should  be on that stage.  God damn, dude.  Fuck the rest of us.  That's a great line.  Love you guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you for your talk.  Dude, do people like your show?  No, I've never seen 
[01:02:00]  Nelson live.  No, Jimmy.  He was horrible.  He was horrible.  What?  It's, you know,  it's the same accent,  the same joke.  The helmet broke again.  You know, the chin strap.  Oh, God.  His Jiffy Jeff gym bit.  Did he do that?  Yeah.  Oh.  Do you remember  the name of the bit?  What's wrong with you?  It was the exact same thing.  I just remember  it's the boxing bit.  It was the exact same thing  as the football bit.  Right.  Only he decided,  he decided after the football thing, 
[01:02:30]  he's like,  I gotta come up with another bit  that's good.  Yeah, I understand.  I'll be a boxer.  But you know the name of the bit.  Because it was his whole thing.  He goes,  Jiffy Jeff, Jeff, Jeff,  what, what, what?  He was hearing his voice  because he was punchy.  You're a big Bob Nelson fan,  I see.  Oh, huge Bob.  No, you know what it was?  It douche chilled me out so bad,  I remember it like a,  like a childhood sexual assault.  I really,  it's ingrained about Uncle Paul.  Wasn't Epi Epperman one of them too?  Oh, oh, yes. 
[01:03:00]  I just, I remember that name.  I remember that name.  With glasses and,  I don't remember what the character was.  Well, I got a surprise.  Bad.  I got a surprise for you guys today.  What?  Bob Nelson stopping by  to do a set for the audience  that came by.  Wow.  Yes, he's in the,  in the,  the office prepping.  Fantastic.  For his big gig  in front of the live audience today.  Can't wait.  Just officially turned on  the audience mic in.  Jimmy turned around  and was in shock  that there were about,  I don't know,  20, 30 people behind him.  Yeah, there was only two guys before.  Yeah, they fucked each other in the ass 
[01:03:30]  and all these people came out.  That's right.  They were,  they birthed all these fucking creeps.  Yeah.  That's great.  We got to ask the women  why they don't listen to us.  I really want to know why.  Is there one woman out there?  I like that.  Hi, me from 1977.  Two?  77.  How you doing?  We got two ladies out there  and about 20 guys.  He doesn't acknowledge.  Maybe because we use cunt as an adverb.  That could be our first problem. 
[01:04:00]  We're not nice to women.  I'm a comic.  I open for Bob Nelson.  Let's give this guy  a quick little something, something.  Scott in Boston.  How are you, Scott?  Good.  How are you?  Hi.  No more Curt Schilling for you guys.  Are you happy, sad,  or don't give a shit?  I don't give a shit.  Mm-hmm.  Good for you.  What do you got, Scott?  I opened up for Bob Nelson last year  at the Comedy Connection in Providence  and basically he stood on stage  and the crowd of 60 plus  would just yell out his bits  and he would just do the bits. 
[01:04:30]  Did he have,  he just,  I'm sorry, man.  Did he have a small crowd?  Because it's got to be hard  if you have,  like,  I don't think he's been on television  in a little while.  If you've got the same audience  and you're doing,  it's got to be kind of difficult  to bring him back.  No, it actually was  a sold-out show.  Well, why'd you say 60 plus?  Yeah, is it a small joint?  No, it was the age,  the age bracket was off.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  So he had a big audience.  All right, good.  Does he seem happy?  It was like a retirement show  and they were just yelling out  Jiffy Jeff  and he'd do the bit  and then they'd yell out football  and he'd do the bit 
[01:05:00]  and they were just,  it was like watching a retirement show.  Die.  Does he look happy there?  At the end of the show,  it was pretty funny  because I don't die.  He's not listening.  Sometimes I feel like a ghost.  Videotapes of his HBO special.  Videotapes?  Yeah.  Actual VCR?  Yep.  He gave me one as a gift.  I'm like,  what the hell am I going  to play this on?  I bet he's got like,  he probably ordered  boxes of VHS copies  years ago  and just has not been able 
[01:05:30]  to get rid of them.  Yeah.  Hey, was he cool to you?  Yeah, he actually was,  he was very nice.  Okay.  He seems like a nice guy.  Yeah.  Got to be humble.  Scott, why don't you plug  your comedy?  Let's go.  I'm going to hang up  on you in seconds  and you didn't get  your opportunity out there.  My website is  scotthigginslive.com  and I'll be at the  Comedy Connexion  in Portland, Maine  the 10th and 11th of April.  Oh.  Bill Blumenreich  is moving you around  a little bit, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Giving you some road work.  Absolutely.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  $25 a spot  and, you know,  drive 2,000 miles.  There you go.  The world of,  the life of a comedian.  Let's go to Steve.  That's fantastic.  One more tidbit  on Bob Nelson.  Go ahead, Steve.  Hello, I'm back  for seconds.  Yeah, he was in that  freaking movie  Brain Donors  with John Turturro.  Is that old or new?  I was pretty old.  Very old, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy.  Pretty funny.  He had,  Bob Nelson had  some real notoriety  for 10 minutes 
[01:06:30]  after that special.  Yeah, he never really  parlayed that into anything.  That was like,  was that a Rodney Dangerfield  special or a Young Comedians?  I want to say that  it was a Dangerfield  HBO special  or Young Comedians.  There might have been  an HBO Young Comedians.  It was just one of those  where back then,  like, you remember  a couple of those episodes  in the comics  and that was one of them.  You kind of remember that  but years later  you just can't keep doing that.  You look at some  of those specials  and everyone is famous now  except, like, the one dude  and you're like,  what happened to that one dude?  You get one guy  and it's like,  yeah, let's bring him out. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, wait, we sort of  did this bit  and the one dude  turns out to be, like,  the most successful  out of all of them.  He's behind the scenes  doing, like,  I don't know,  cartoon voices or something.  Yeah, he's a producer  or something.  A writer.  Yeah, we kind of did that.  Who was with Bob Nelson?  His, uh,  with an act like that  it's like a sketch show  is probably where you parlay it  or where you, like,  where you can kind of  do characters.  Like Tracy Ullman.  I mean, you know,  it's her whole character thing  and she's made a career out of it.  Oh, the one woman show  was fantastic.  Yeah.  I hate one woman 
[01:07:30]  and one man shows.  I know we've had people  do them that have been  friends of ours.  Chaz is one man show.  No, no, no,  that's different.  I mean, like, comedians.  When they get up  and do these things,  I'm just like,  all right, here he goes.  I heard Birbiglia's is good, though,  as much as that pains me  to support other comedians.  Yeah, I did hear  that was good.  It's over now, though, isn't it?  I don't know.  I think that was a short run.  Yeah.  I had a massage therapist  say to me,  do you know Mike Birbiglia?  And I wanted to bite  her fingers off  like a monkey. 
[01:08:00]  Claw her face.  Take her face off.  Jeremy in Oklahoma.  Jeremy.  Or Jerry.  Jerry.  Oh, hey.  Jerry.  Jerry.  I'm a surly truck driver.  Yeah.  And I came up to your city  the other day  and it cost me 87 bucks  to go from  the George Washington  over to JFK  and back out.  Oh, yeah.  How does that make sense?  I mean, come on.  You're destroying the roads, sir.  Well, absolutely.  Yeah.  And they're broke.  And they're broke.  They're broke.  How does that make sense?  Come on. 
[01:08:30]  We need more money.  Yeah.  All right.  He meowed.  Well, why don't we take a break?  But I don't want Tim in Pittsburgh  to go anywhere  because he wants to know  if he got a boner last night  when they talked about  Back to the Future on Lost.  I heard about that.  Oh, my goodness.  We'll get into that  after the break.  We'll get into that.  We also got to get into  the royal family here,  the Obamas,  visiting the royal family  over there in England.  You might be surprised  at my take on this.  Really?  We'll tell you about it. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, God.  Good God.  And look at the stuff  we're giving away  to the audience today.  Just amazing.  It's great stuff.  It's being set up.  It's a lot more of it.  Basically, if you showed up  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,  E-Rock said,  fuck you.  You got screwed.  I don't give a shit about you.  Yeah.  Because the prizes  have gotten way better.  Sam, really fast.  We're trying to go to break here,  but really fast.  Oh, my goodness.  We have magazines  that you and all the comedians signed.  Bowling shoes signed by P.O.D.  A ton of signed CDs and DVDs. 
[01:09:30]  That's how you dropped something, Kenny.  Pick it up, stupid.  Mike Rebiglia-style stuff.  We've got a promo picture  of E-Rock's old wrestling character,  the Pink Flamingo.  The Pink Flamingo.  A couple of snuggies.  They even have a Darth Vader helmet  that Kenny pulled out of the garbage  and signed.  Oh, nice.  Wow.  As well as tons of signed  Opie and Anthony material  and Jeff Norris material.  And shirts.  Shirts.  A lot of wrestling shirts.  Shirts up the ass.  Yeah.  A lot of wrestling shirts,  wrestling DVDs.  It means a lot of them.  Oh, all right. 
[01:10:00]  There's so many  that you can't store them everywhere,  so you got to start  shoving them up your ass.  I believe that's where  that came from.  Yes, it did.  Signed Gangsta Fag CDs.  Wow.  Oh, that's a big get today.  Look at that.  That got an O from the audience.  I like that.  We got a little  Lost in Space picture there,  I see, framed.  Oh, dear.  Oh, yes.  Ah, right.  Wow.  Ooh.  And the famous pictures  of me and Opie  as little children.  Yeah.  Little tussleable kids. 
[01:10:30]  On a T-shirt.  On a T-shirt.  On a T-shirt.  Wonderful.  Afternoons 3 to 7  on WNEW FM.  Those were the days.  You won't look like  a pedophile wearing that.  No, not at all.  Wonderful.  All right.  Two young boys on a shirt.  Yeah, I remember  when you posed for that picture.  Oh.  He was crying.  Uncle Paul,  you made me feel better, though.  I told your father  to give you some whiskey.  I don't remember that.  I know.  I blacked out.  My hiney hurt.  And also, 
[01:11:00]  another copy of  Grand Theft Auto  Vice City Stories  signed by Opie Anthony  and the entire ONA staff  and a Vice City Stories  members-only jacket.  Holy shit,  why don't I have that?  You didn't win.  You're a dick.  No, actually,  that is the reason you have it.  You don't have it.  Good to know.  Aw, Jim.  Almost went to break  without a boo.  A boo.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.
