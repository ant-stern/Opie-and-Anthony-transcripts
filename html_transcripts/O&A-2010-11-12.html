<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing their show's success and controversial nature, followed by banter about their weekend plans, sleep, and their hatred of daylight saving time, escalating to a humorous hypothetical about manipulating the sun's schedule.  Opie shared a detailed anecdote about his winter fire-poking ritual and carrying a firearm at home.  This segued into a discussion of baby products, specifically a shower hat, leading to a comparison of their contrasting upbringings â€“ Opie's resourcefulness versus Anthony's privilege.  Opie also vented about the New York Islanders' poor performance and the unpleasantness of attending their games, mentioning Colin Quinn as an upcoming guest and further detailing his difficult childhood and his decision to give away his Islanders tickets.  The hosts also briefly discussed a planned arena development and a poor hockey player, Ilya Kovalchuk.

Patrice O'Neal joined the show, and the conversation turned to Neil Young's musical career and artistic integrity, compared to other artists like Eric Burdon.  This was followed by a comedic segment featuring poorly produced news teases from a Detroit news station, filled with bizarre crime and health stories.  They then played and ridiculed a passenger's song about a cruise ship experiencing mechanical problems, a Gilligan's Island-style parody.

Colin Quinn arrived in studio. The hosts joked about his newfound success and the changes in his behavior since gaining a publicist, teasing him about his shift from "pissed off Colin" to a more mainstream persona, touching upon his views on the entertainment industry and his Broadway success.  They playfully ribbed him about his perceived "white acceptance" and contrasted his earlier style with his current, more polished image.  The cruise ship song was played again and mocked.

The conversation with Colin Quinn continued, focusing on his experiences with media training, the changing comedy world, and the expectation of more "schmoozing."  They joked about the differences between intimidating ("the Hulk") and less aggressive ("Bill Bixby") comedians, and the perceived "Seinfeld Mafia" within the comedy world.  They also discussed Scorch, a public access TV personality, whose show was scheduled to air after a break.  A publicist's silent judgment was implied throughout.  The segment concluded with promotion of Quinn's Broadway show, *Long Story Short*, and plugs for the hosts' social media.

The show then moved to a segment about Scorch and his low-budget cable access show, "PFG TV," highlighting its awkwardness, frequent sponsor requests, and crude humor.  They discussed a "Pause for the Cause" incident where Scorch was caged and pelted with paint, and his false claims of being in talks with XM radio.  The discussion shifted to Bobo and a pre-recorded, sexually explicit anti-bullying PSA.  A large portion focused on Bobo's online relationship with "I Heart Bobo," speculating on whether she was real.

"I Heart Bobo" then called in, revealing herself to be a real person who had traveled from Canada to surprise Bobo.  She was brought into the studio, and Bobo, visibly aroused, experienced an ongoing erection.  The hosts and Patrice O'Neal repeatedly pressured Bobo to expose himself to Allie ("I Heart Bobo"), despite his protests.  The conversation became extremely sexually charged and vulgar, with numerous crude jokes and comments about Bobo's erection, Allie's body, and sexual acts. Colin Quinn became visibly uncomfortable. Allie left abruptly, seemingly upset.  The segment ended with Bobo's disappointment and the hosts' attempts to console him, followed by further discussion of the incident and the hosts' behavior.

[00:02:00]  no shit man sometimes it's the best sometimes you do nothing sometimes someone calls and you go  yeah i can do that i got no plans none whatsoever and some people feel bad when they got no plans like  i got no plans no plans i'm not uh people aren't calling me what's going on  uh fuck gotta wake the fuck up really a little snoozy actually because i slept well for once  yeah that'll i'm way better not sleeping i don't know what it is sometimes uh you get no sleep and 
[00:02:30]  you're tired i get a lot of sleep you're tired i just think it's the hours yeah i like being a little  punchy i like yeah yeah i like being a little tired and feel like i need to sleep but i like that  i slept like a like a mother like a mother hooker gotta say that phrase a few times before the t-shirts  come out what's going on brother what's up nothing i did not i had no plans last night really yes i had 
[00:03:00]  no plans i just sat my uh my existence during the uh especially the beginning of fall and and winter  is pretty much because the summer i love it's uh it's light out late now it's you know what is it  three o'clock in the afternoon and it's pitch black uh whatever it is it's the dumbest thing ever i don't  enjoy it just keep it light out i don't like it just keep it nice and light out because your whole  body clock you know shifts oh oh it's already dark time for bed that's five in the afternoon 
[00:03:30]  by 5 30 you could do five more hours of shit but you don't feel like it because it's dark everywhere  by 5 30 you're just kind of walking around going oh yeah it's pitch black out it's dark it's  night time sunsets at 4 45 45 that's correct and it'll just get worse and worse until like  december just because our stupid ancestors thought this was a good idea we don't think it's a good  idea anymore can keep it light out it's terrible why why would they make it uh dark before most people  get out of work that's the dumbest thing ever yeah i i i don't like it yeah i i look at the clock 
[00:04:00]  sometimes i go if it was summer i'd be outside the sun would still be shining of course in the  pool i'd be and then you look out and go oh it's night time it's time for bed right it's just there's  no rhyme or reason to it but it just i can't motivate myself here's my night during these uh uh winter  months i uh i don't really leave the house very often like literally don't even go outside just to get 
[00:04:30]  wood for the fireplace it's outside so i get some wood i bring it in i turn on tv i look for a tv show  i uh grab a beer from downstairs and then i'm obsessively poking at the fire i'm an obsessive  fire poker why don't you like i hire someone to do that for you too no fire poker because i'm alone  you're not i sit i sit on the couch all alone i i i sip on my little beer i i go through the remote 
[00:05:00]  to find something and then i look over the fire and i think oh that log's got to be turned and i  obsess at turning logs over and throwing another one on that's oh that's a good fire i become obsessed  with having a good fire you want a perfect fire yes yeah i don't want to be that that guy i'm like  a hamster on a wheel at night downstairs beer remote poke fire beer remote poke fire that sounds  like a fine night oh it is there's nothing wrong with that it's wonderful and then i i also when 
[00:05:30]  i go downstairs in the basement i gotta have my phone with me uh and and my firearm why well because you  never know if someone's gonna break in when you're downstairs and i don't want to leave it upstairs see  i don't like sitting with it in a holster or something on the couch so i just put it on like  the table next to me but then i think if i go downstairs and i come up and someone's there go  ah you screwed up didn't you oops so you walk around the house with the gun in your hand yeah 
[00:06:00]  so i gotta like walk around with it like in one hand and my phone in the other as i just walk around  the house prepared wondering if the neighbors can like look in the window and just see me walking around  the house like a loan attack armed i don't here's a house here's a guy uh wants to talk about the  reason for daylight savings time we don't care ah we don't care where where it started what the  reason is i mean just go with logic people don't want to leave work at five o'clock and it's pitch 
[00:06:30]  dark out already no they want to be able to do a few things you know after work maybe makes rush hour  worse because people can't drive at night not only should i mean if we didn't do the daylight savings  time it would be 5 45 the sun would set right yeah i suggest we go the complete opposite and  make the sun set at 6 45 tack another friggin uh because who cares if it's really dark in the  morning when you're going to work it doesn't matter you can't do anything anyway it should be spring  ahead spring twice ahead exactly logically that makes sense right yeah until like the next year when 
[00:07:00]  you never pull back and then you spring ahead again and before you know it it's midnight and it's  that's fine people would enjoy that it's fine there'd be less uh people crashing after coming  home from the bars they could see that would be nice they could see shit that would be odd walking  out of a bar at three in the morning and it's just bright noon sunlight yeah i think i think the sun  should rise yeah you're gonna think this is crazy i understand 11 a.m 11 a.m before you laugh at me  think about it it's a waste of time in the morning right who cares if it's light out while you're 
[00:07:30]  showering and going to work yeah that's true and then right around the time you might be able to  step out of the office for a little lunch the sun is coming up for the day everyone gets to see a  beautiful sun the first time that you actually get to go outside there's the sun before that it  doesn't matter because you're working and then that means that the sun sets way later in the day  and you could do all sorts of shit after work why the fuck not what of the farmers they get up a  little later they just make it farm until nine at night isn't the sun supposed to peek in on the 
[00:08:00]  window as you're waking up like for normal people doesn't it kind of no no and the farmers could  figure it out on their own yeah just to offset their schedule whatever the hours of sunlight is  that's their schedule that's that don't you know why do farmers want to get up at three in the  morning to start farming they're the earliest risers ever dumb farmers stay in bed and what for the  the morale of the factory workers well they get to work and they're in a factory they don't what 
[00:08:30]  do you think there's light nice windows we don't have big picture windows in factory yeah what is  a factory yeah there's not what are you 18 there's not there's not a window in a factory man there's  not a factory i'm telling you my black them up with with windows if they got them who can i talk to  about this idea this is brilliant i'm telling you this is brilliant who's in charge of the time  why waste the in charge of time why waste the sunlight when when we can't use it anyway  have it when you could use it you could start using it around 11 a.m noon that's beautiful and 
[00:09:00]  then what does that mean when would the sun set if the sun rose every day at 11 and that's what i  want every day at 11 so you call it you're gonna really have to fuck around with your your your uh  your your clock nine at night yeah the sun would probably start setting around nine or ten at night  perfect yeah right around the time you're you're done and you're starting to settle in  for some tv uh uh watching yes uh kenny but gh if you're taking this on why stop there you have to 
[00:09:30]  straighten out the days of the weeks and the months too well i think also i think it's completely insane  that people are still working five-day work weeks you don't need to anymore yeah most people could do  their jobs in three to four days i'm not even joking with technology and but people can't think out of the  box for some reason that it's because employers just go well it's always been you know monday  through friday but if they sat down and logically thought about it they could get the same amount  of work from an individual in less days that's a risky thing though because the way like employers 
[00:10:00]  are in certain companies now nowadays if you went to somebody and said i could get my job done in three  days they'd be like oh we'll just give you two more days of work for the same price exactly why can't  if you get it done in three days we'll just give you some more work so much work in five days increase  our production it's up to the bosses i'm talking to the bosses they got to wake the fuck up because  then you get you get happier employers uh employees excuse me yes if you only had to work four days a 
[00:10:30]  week you'd be so happy you you couldn't you wouldn't be uh that's shit as they say you'd be  shit you'd be skipping to work every day knowing that you have a great gig because your boss is cool  and then allows you to get your job done in four days and because the sun comes up at 11 o'clock  in the morning yes yeah well i'm skipping work so what day do we kill thursday uh i mean friday or  monday people would love tuesday would just be the new monday yeah well but friday is such a  celebration day i feel like friday's an easy day i think mondays are yeah because they wrote a song 
[00:11:00]  about that day yeah that's why maybe you could sing it for us i don't like mondays oh i thought  you're gonna sing manic monday by the bank i don't know because those are the fun days really i don't  know but tgif the entire chain of restaurants would have to rename to tgith if we took friday and  that's fine it would be thursday tgith doesn't it just no think of all the flare they'd have to  change whatever it takes man whatever it takes the sun rises at 11 starting monday in my world 
[00:11:30]  and monday becomes a week and i'm not here on mondays anymore welcome to opie did awake and bake this  morning uh they call it wake up and smoke weed this is called logic my friends we need more of it in  this stupid country enough of just following what everyone else did before you came here idiots  yeah i i never the fuck up the sun should not set at 4 45 let's get back to that point that's 
[00:12:00]  ridiculous i think obama should change when the sun rises like just change all the times yes why  not oh the republicans wouldn't like that no just because it's obama we like it at 6 a.m i wouldn't  like why the fuck not vomit did it um also i went to uh bye bye baby yesterday no i got a younger  wife you just had it i got a younger wife what oh bye bye baby oh i thought you said goodbye to your  baby it's like wait a minute that's hilarious what are you saying wow baby death joke no it wasn't a 
[00:12:30]  dance no it wasn't that what does bye bye baby it was like you give it away or something oh oh i  wouldn't say that my god god forbid i'm knocking wood um and what i found out is uh we didn't need  all this shit when we were growing up there's stuff for everything my my wife bought a bought a uh you  guys make fun of it with the george harrison thing my baby now has a gutter hat for baths what 
[00:13:00]  you're talking about where so why you know this thing so the water doesn't get in your eyes yeah i  didn't like shampoo getting in my eyes no you didn't get the fuck out of here you didn't have  a little your mom got you one of these is it blue is it made of foam rubber and it kind of put it's  like a crown oh my god and it extends out dude are you shitting me you had i used it i used it last  night just to check it out i'm throwing it away already it's it's the stupidest idea ever did you 
[00:13:30]  actually have oh yes i did i was using it until i was like four oh by the way show and guaranteed your  mom still has it oh i'm sure she does what do you mean you were using it until you were four  yeah i was using it until i was well i mean i remember specifically wanting it you were like  oh i want that but at four you could figure it out you you're not going to get shampoo in your eyes and  and and get earaches no i mean you still because if you open your eye you just don't like getting  shampoo in your eyes it could still squeeze in when you shut your eyes and sting a little 
[00:14:00]  why aren't you using johnson's baby shampoo no more tears that's it's this right except mine  was blue oh my god is that it this it's like a backwards visor type of thing it's no mine extended  all the way around that looks like a little plastic tutu that you put around the kid's head a little  bit let me see if i can find a picture that is insanity dude it's it you go to bye bye baby or  or uh babies are us i bet it's spelled b-u-y right yeah of course bye bye baby okay now i understand 
[00:14:30]  honestly it's it's i didn't know it was a store honestly it's the dumbest name for for a baby  store because that's you know that's the fear every fucking parent has and then there's a store called  bye bye baby that's the that's the joke why would they fucking call it that yeah i have an old oldie  song it doesn't matter the first that you know you don't want to uh whatever it is pretty bad it's  dumb it's b-u-y yeah no i know but it's so you buy the actual children on the black market  bye bye baby children can i have an asian one please this is yeah this is the hat i had that's 
[00:15:00]  the one you had oh yeah except it was blue and no japanese characters oh it was blue so uh for boys  yes right yeah because that would make it really masculine that's not the one that we bought and then  my brother got one because since i had one he was the younger brother and he wanted one as well  dude you got the pink one no no blue oh that's even more disturbing because you're 26 27 somewhere  around there i didn't know they had these way back when you were a kid oh and then you had it until 
[00:15:30]  you were four are you kidding me yeah i mean i had it until i remember saying i'm not taking a shower  i was old enough to demand that i needed to still wear the shower crown or whatever it's called  at four yeah i had to be four because i wouldn't remember if i was two and you knew how to just wash your  hair by yourself but you still put that on yeah hell no i didn't like the shower  yeah i didn't like it because because oh god it all came across i hated i wouldn't be good 
[00:16:00]  waterboarding it should have been removed with a shotgun oh my god exactly it looks like a big tea  cup or something yeah and then their hair is in that and what it pours off the back yeah  the stuff that they're thinking of for for babies these days it's ridiculous and unfortunately we  bought into it or or my wife did looks like a russian orthodox priest it does right we should  i tried it once and i'm like that's it for the stupid fucking uh water hat or whatever you want to 
[00:16:30]  call it maybe i go back to wearing that who wants shampoo in their eyes yeah well you were four i was  old enough that i should have just closed my eyes tighter that would be bad uh i bet you would hate  being waterboarded yeah because i hated having water and shampoo in my face yeah and so that's why  i had to have the crown plus i was the little prince i think obama said that they'll bring back waterboarding  if they put that on the people at guantanamo there you go they have to wear the little hat it's it's 
[00:17:00]  civility yeah but it's just the stupidest stuff they they sell for for babies who thinks it's just  like someone is sitting somewhere in a giant palatial mansion because they came up with that  thing it's probably like a mother comes up with the idea and then she tells some guy and the guy  steals the idea and makes a whole bunch of money i made it out of a big scrunchie yeah and the guy's like  oh that's that's an okay idea but don't like prototype i'll run to the patent office yeah 
[00:17:30]  right across the street when we were growing up i don't even think we had baby stores where  did our parents get baby shit maybe in a section of a of a of a macy's or something like a department  store yeah yeah they didn't have like specialty stores no she'd probably go to gimbals right went  to gimbals and they certainly didn't have this water hat so the water didn't get in their eyes  no this is it here's the blue one that's the exact one that's the exact one you had until you  were four yeah you just looked silly except i had a big head so like we had to get the bigger ones 
[00:18:00]  because my they're made of foam rubber and i would literally rip the hats oh my god that's  ridiculous that's almost the funny thing is that's almost like your penis head ripping your foreskin  that's right it's like the you know you know the little thing your head would rip it and your head  would rip it that's foreshadowing to the future of my penis for skin shadowing for skin she did all  this stuff for you but she didn't take care of your penis until you were 17 was it a little hat on that 
[00:18:30]  too 17 19 19 then like water on his balls a little hat on your head she didn't think there was a problem  when she could barely see a penis hole but she got she got you all this shit so the water wouldn't get  in your eyes she wasn't examining my penis hole properly she should have been i'm kind of glad  she wasn't trust me you know your kid's penis i don't know why didn't she notice your penis i don't  know maybe she didn't love me as much as i thought she did nah she's crazy about you you know literally 
[00:19:00]  the kid's penis so i don't know what that's about maybe mine was just very small as a baby she probably  didn't want to even acknowledge it that was probably wanted to that wasn't a perfect it's okay no  imperfections yeah yeah he's perfect oh he's my perfect boy he won't eat that's okay we'll just  feed him what oh he doesn't want water in his face that's okay he's my perfect little boy she said my  head was so big when i was a baby when she gave birth she passed out  squeezing that big head oh yeah she passed out she was unconscious you were crowning for like two hours 
[00:19:30]  oh wow yeah she became unconscious oh bobby rules oh man she passed out from the  pain yeah oh yes is bobby up yet i don't know i mean no she's in kentucky what you didn't even  know your mom was in kentucky she's in kentucky she went yesterday with my dad who's gonna do your  laundry for the next uh in a couple days well no i'll just save it up for the next couple days once  she gets home there'll be a nice pile of laundry wait are you gonna have a party and break the glass  egg you fucking creep no did you slide in your socks and sing old-time rock and roll i don't live with 
[00:20:00]  my mom oh you kind of do no it sounds like you do yeah technically you don't but you kind of do  it sounds like you do i know it does but that's because i'm relating stories of the past and  sometimes when i go over for dinner but we talked about my landlord earlier this week so yeah obviously  how's that working out for you today move today i made it i made it so far you didn't make it yet  you got to get out i know i was nervous though i just wanted to make it through the nights the

[00:21:00]  in trouble one more these tenants go to eleven that's right you're an eleven tenant most tenants  look ten ten right across the board these ones but but they go to eleven yeah yeah he called your  chick to tell her that yeah he doesn't have my phone number he doesn't want it either so infatuated  with her it's probably who wouldn't be i'm just saying well thank you i think i'm just saying 
[00:21:30]  do you have to return the key uh-oh there he's sending over a real estate person you think he'll  do that though oh boy oh no it's him dressed like a woman yeah with a wig on a skirt a blonde wig  and a skirt and he would acknowledge that it's him just talking hello yeah you're the bad girl voice  oh where are you moving jesus well hopefully we'll see you monday oh fingers crossed fingers  crossed that's right yeah all right so that's good luck that was it man the stupid the stupid water 
[00:22:00]  hat yeah water which i already threw away after using it once it was a pain in the neck he's not  gonna want shampoo in his eyes though dude it's stupid it was a dumb purchase you gotta admit when  you you you purchase something dumb don't you take that cup or something yes that's what i was  doing with a cup of water i had no problem with that and then yeah you i guess you get uh pulled  into buying some of this horse shit and it just i told you about the nana saver right we didn't buy  one of those did you buy a nana saver see because little kids can't eat a whole banana and why have 
[00:22:30]  that little piece of brown if you cut a banana in half and save that half of the banana why are you  saving bananas is it a cap for when they're 10 cents for 100 pounds i don't know we didn't buy  that huh we didn't buy that did you buy the the little thing that you put like grapes or apples in  so i've seen that the juice what it's for yeah it's for no you are you are holding a grudge oh i  said get the juice i thought you were uh no all right sorry uh yeah i've seen that it's for infants 
[00:23:00]  it's like a netted thing it's like a oh okay fish net thing we didn't have that fruit and a kid  chews on it but he doesn't get any of the yeah we used to you know we used to just give each  other the heimlich left and right because we were choking on everything growing up because they  didn't have all this stuff show them the nana saver the nana saver someone's a millionaire for  coming up with this dumb thing and people are actually buying there you go it's a half plastic 
[00:23:30]  banana that goes over the real banana so that that part of the banana doesn't get brown because they  can't eat the whole fucking no we do not buy that is the silliest thing you will buy a lot of things  though that you end up you know just realizing are stupid of course like the nana saver who's buying  that why do you have to save half a banana how poor are you i thought the nana i thought the nana  saver was a life alert oh look nana's on the floor nana saver yeah it's like a little clip that you 
[00:24:00]  clip on the end of a nana the clip looks like the other half of the banana so that's fun could  be dangerous that's not fun i bet your mom bought you one my mom would god i hate i hate you and your  mom i saw you because you got everything you're a little spoiled yeah because i was in so yeah  yeah maybe it's because of jealousy sure but i had the complete opposite mom yeah yes you didn't  have a water hat no you got shampoo in your little eyes we fucking had to take baths together to save  fucking water i took some baths with my brother for sure but we both had water hats on dude i have 
[00:24:30]  five brothers and sisters oh yeah i was just two and a sister i sort of acknowledge but she moved  away a real long time ago so my uh my wife gets mad when i don't acknowledge her how come you don't  acknowledge her she moved away when i was 12 she lives in florida she listens to the show every day  my relatives all live in different spots they're still my relatives acknowledge them yeah  my parents are in kentucky visiting there's pictures of uh five of us in one bathtub sam 
[00:25:00]  oh five that's a lot of people is it a big bathtub no you know penises getting touched penises were  being touched and the water was getting very warm oh god from urine but then but then logically when  we got a little bigger my mom decided so i lucked out on this one that the older oldest kid at the time  being me got the bath water first and then it would go down the line oh so the owner of fh riley's  bread is is still holding a grudge to this day yeah he was last one in the water you took turns using 
[00:25:30]  the bathtubs the bath water the fuck are you little house on the prairie my mom was insane if you haven't  figured it out just tub back up why fresh she was fucking saving on the water bill how much was the  water bill in the 70s water bills are exactly still nothing you're just washing each other's filth  exactly she was insane that's not good so then he would get in and the water wouldn't be as warm  and there'd be a soap residue and dirt oil slick yes whatever the fuck it was in there 
[00:26:00]  oh that's a true story disgusting wow that was a that was a regular occurrence at our house  but you put a go i was just gonna say but sam's mom wouldn't wouldn't allow no sam's mom no my mom  would refill the bath of course she was halfway through his bath halfway through his bath she probably  said get out the water's not as fresh as it could be there's not enough bubbles in there for you  let me wash your penis for you properly she puts a nanoclip on the end of his dick so she doesn't  have to look at his stupid foreskin she clips a nanoclip on his dick and it keeps it fresh too 
[00:26:30]  yes it keeps your penis fresh with your dumb water hat your water head hat i'm friends i'm friends with  sam but i i truly hate you and your mom that's fair that's fair it's just it's because i i don't understand  people that were brought up properly because that's not properly other end of the spectrum  that's true he's got his own issues because that's not because you know what you're right i don't feel  i don't hate you as much now that and just said that because that's right i mean it should be  somewhere in the middle in the middle right yeah there obviously is a problem and like you said 
[00:27:00]  she did ignore that i had to get a circumcision at 19 so obviously there were problems about  yeah can we can we wake up bobby in kentucky oh my god yeah yes time zone isn't it yeah well i  think it's an hour off they have cell phones so it won't be as easy to wake them up why i don't  know their hotel phone number what i got the jitterbug i got the jitterbug i can't and here's the other  thing i can't even tell how old his parents are they're ageless i don't know how they can either be 
[00:27:30]  in their 60s or their late 40s i don't know i'm not even joking i don't even know well the children  your dad's got a full head of hair that's sort of gray with that whacked out mustache it is big  thick mustache right so the mustache weight lifter right yeah i would guess your parents are in their  50s well i'm sure that i'm not they wouldn't want me to reveal their age not telling tales out of  school no i would guess late 50s maybe tops i've inundated this show with embarrassing stories about 
[00:28:00]  them yeah and you won't tell the age that's probably the one thing that would get them offended am i  close really well yeah of course i mean i'm 27 so yeah but you got an older they're not in their  40s my sister's yeah yeah 30 or 31 okay so they could be anywhere from 50 to 60 70 to 78 yeah there's a  28 year uh buffer there that we have i talked to my sister for the first time since we had my mom and  dad on the air a couple weeks ago and she was not happy that uh i said that my mom didn't like 
[00:28:30]  she was i said my mom didn't like her because she acted like my dad she got all mad how much does it  rock when you say all this ridiculous stuff on the radio and then have to deal with the people you  were talking about yeah you don't even put it into context people listening right people feelings  i hate going to weddings because i'm like oh fuck talked about there's always something that you have to  be resented there's always something that comes back to haunt me all these stories that people just  tell around the dinner table and are funny they're not supposed to be repeated right 
[00:29:00]  for a big audience you definitely have to be resented though by your siblings because you were  the the one that was just doted over i don't think so everybody got some doting i think like i said my  brother also had a water hat that's just because he cried because you had one and he got one though  the water hat yes yeah well that was that was my night what else do they sell at bye bye baby  uh there's so much i i didn't even know where to start because i was going to try to make some kind 
[00:29:30]  of ridiculous video of all the dumb stuff you buy it's ridiculous better babies are us it's a better  baby it's a very good story but babies are us is just as bad they're they're horrible places they're  just horrible places is the b on the second bye bye baby backwards do they try to do like the babies  are us thing no but they're just horrible places because they're putting a lot of pressure  on parents to like buy all this oh there's something for everything yeah why there's a  whole wall of stuff to baby proof your home and and when we were growing up we we didn't do we didn't 
[00:30:00]  baby proof shit it was it was falling into something cracking your head open and then your father going  like yeah that'll teach you of course now you won't do it again you won't put that was baby proofing you  won't put your finger in that plug anymore will you i'd go downstairs into the basement and my father  not the most motivated guy so if he was doing some kind of project around the house everything  would just be left out and plugged in and everything i mean there were jigsaws and 
[00:30:30]  fucking table saws um all kinds of shit just plugged in and ready to go right it looked like the set of of  saw the saw movies downstairs and we could go down there and just fuck with the shit if we  fucking cut our fingers off it would just be ah whatever we had a garage that had the same  shit all sorts of tools my dad liked to rebuild his own house meaning we had to rebuild our own  house holy shit fucking little rascals it's not fun after a while at first when you you hammer in a 
[00:31:00]  few nails it's kind of fun but you know when you're rebuilding the entire second floor guess what it's  not fun anymore dad all the kids have a union right we might as well have my brother says that we had  barracks not rooms because we were constantly rebuilding our own house that's why i haven't picked  a hammer in years did your dad come in and just start banging on a garbage pail to wake up oh  yeah we used to cement paths that led to nowhere just to keep us busy yeah we like on the rock pile  we have we have a path that goes into the woods not to a gazebo or any anything it just ends in the 
[00:31:30]  woods and that was just to keep us busy one summer there are bodies out there because you know because  we had to stay out of my mom's hair because you know we gotta all take care of mom  but anyway uh the the garage had all the shit you were saying and we would go in and just start  shit up just because we could right like yeah wow look at the saw blade spin and and if your father  ever caught you or or he'd give you my dad would give me a warning like um don't fuck with my shit i 
[00:32:00]  don't want you to break it he had no concern that don't you know touch the tools they're very dangerous  anthony and perhaps you know i'll teach you someday safety and stuff but in the meantime until i have  time stay away from the tools no it was don't fuck with my shit you'll break it he just didn't want to  buy a new one no he didn't want to buy a new one it was probably wasn't even his anyway it's probably  something he stole from work or something that he borrowed from the neighbor that he never gave back 
[00:32:30]  sure i remember doing that as a kid though too like i would just walk into the garage and just  just touch the saw blade the rusty saw blade because i was all that looks yeah yeah let's find out  yeah let's find out how sharp it is let's just play with tools every day yeah but now they got a wall  of shit to keep your house safe a wall of shit it goes up to what 20 feet oh yeah it's like a  warehouse this place are your doorknobs child-proof nothing's child-proof what is the how does the  doorknob how they can't turn they can't turn the doorknob what do they what do you got to do to  you have to squeeze it and then turn grip and twist doorknob oh it's like a little rubber thing 
[00:33:00]  that'll just spin on the knob yeah yeah unless you squeeze it you gotta get those in the oven too  kids gotta figure that out though after a while right yeah they shop so the kids don't hit their  head on doorknobs yeah that's what i'm concerned about it's like a cold war with the children they  figure it out and then you got to come up with new technology i got a massive glass coffee table that  i love and all the yeah the in-laws and everyone's like when the fuck do you love it like that do you  love it like danny thomas he'll never live that but they're all paranoid about the glass coffee 
[00:33:30]  table they're obsessed they're like have you got rid of the glass coffee table yet holy  shit it's like an iphone protector for your glass table yeah i already got that i haven't put it on  yet it just goes right around it did you get a baby wipe warmer oh we had this since day one i  haven't used a baby wipe warmer i'd like that for my little wipes nice and warm can i get that nice  little whoo when you're uh cleaning up that would be great for adults but i'm not warming up  fucking baby wipes for my kid but you just put them in and they're warm what does he need that you 
[00:34:00]  use them well i mean you use the thing oh believe me this guy probably uses every single thing and  and it's just it's a box that is just constantly warm so it's just it's not like i'm doing any work  it's just another step when i'm babysitting my kid i i don't want to like it's what you got to take  a wipe out to begin with i'm either taking it out of a box or the warmer it's not babysitting  if it's yours it does the kid has a kid ever cried because the wipe was too cold you can tell 
[00:34:30]  it's a little uncomfortable no no you can't he doesn't uh yeah travis no one can't the kid has no  idea you're doing it for yourself thinking that you're helping out the kid oh he's gonna like the  warmer wipe yeah it feels better you said yourself you would like to have one i'm an adult oh look at  this and and this is what could happen with your your baby wipe oh shit a horror story nate in  arizona nate yeah how you doing what's up brother i uh my mother-in-law said we needed a baby wipe 
[00:35:00]  warmer that way the wipes would uh be warm whenever we were going to change my daughter's butt well you  actually have to add water to those um which is sometimes people don't let you in on because after  they heat up for so long if they don't have proper moisture they will catch on fire uh well travis  refuting your claim sir he just threw up his arms and said no you don't well maybe the technology's  gotten better on those what do you have an old one that you gotta load logs into flaming like a steam 
[00:35:30]  engine with your ghetto baby wipe warmer yeah you come on poor person you have a ghetto baby  wipe warmer spoot leg sam did your mom put uh warm baby wipes on your penis when you were growing  up i don't i think we've already established that my mom did not pay close enough attention  long to my freakish penis no she probably had to have that penis covered at all times when she was  changing her diaper but a baby god i hate your mom why a baby shouldn't have surgery on their penis 
[00:36:00]  look what happened to bobo i'm glad it happened when you're a little older that was a different  thing than a circumcision there's a little more area to work with he got a circumcision  via pitbull that's what it looks like just chewing it on the corner of his mouth like a little like a  little doggy bone except there was a pitbull with no teeth they were just gumming it it just ruined it  i think my dad had an anteater really but he was like a catholic guy like ah i don't understand that  it's definitely an old school thing because i i got circumcised at three that's where this all started 
[00:36:30]  which is crazy that's ridiculous they'd like three is way worse than 19 you think so yes why  they uh they lop it off now like the second you shot out of the womb they just hours hours later  right you sit in this thing uh these babies got put in this plastic thing that looks like uh the seat of  the mercury capsule it's like shaped like a baby how do you know this because i was doing an air 
[00:37:00]  conditioning job once at a hospital i don't even i don't even know this on the outside of one of the  like recovery rooms for kids getting circumcisions right so i looked through the window and there's a  bunch of little kids with their dicks pulled through this plastic thing and they're all  fucking screaming bloody murder little bloody head of their dick and they're laying in these space  capsule seats it was a horror show i think you just make it miserable human beings they have to  remember that somehow in their little tiny brains little things like falling down and stuff i'm sure  they don't remember when someone's fucking pulling your penis through a plastic thing pulling your 
[00:37:30]  penis through plastic and then fucking slicing pieces of it off i think they might remember they  take a potato uh peeler that's how they do that what they do just like a carrot right around  it hurts for days after that too well maybe when you're 19 when you're 19 yes well the babies  probably how long from the time you got the circumcision to the time you were able to jerk  off uh at least three weeks at least wow did you just fucking shoot like a your mom at least yeah 
[00:38:00]  it must have been good yeah is it what then you start poking at the head and you whoa that's very  sensitive that's been hidden for so long it's been hidden away look what we got here exactly did your  mom at least test it out what to make sure you're healing prop to make sure you were healing properly  sam did she demand to like look at it during the healing process to make sure you didn't have to  go back to the make sure there was an infection or anything no she did not demand no neither of  them demanded my dad sure he would ask me hey is everything okay neither of them demanded and if 
[00:38:30]  they had demanded it would have been denied that's what wow that's what you call let me see that  let me see that there was no let me see that they have to make sure little sam is okay after his  i was 19. circumcision 19. little sam is misleading were you uh were you uh were you surprised at the  sensitivity oh very after the unveiling it's very sensitive you should cover it up with flesh for 19  years oh no and then poke it whoa and then poke it well look what we got here when it brushes against 
[00:39:00]  your boxers whoa it took quite a while yeah to desensitize to walk around with your pelvis back  how many times did you come just trying to leave the house walking around he's making comesies  shooting glue all over the place oh shit baby glue just enjoying himself in his new crusty underpants  every day unveiled cockhead uh rolls that's disgusting that is so there you go wow that's 
[00:39:30]  there you're fucking you had a really odd fucking uh odd childhood and it still continues your childhood  is still continuing well i never would want to deny my inner child inner it's all on the outside oh you  know what we have to um we have to do a real comparison about my childhood compared to yours 
[00:40:00]  so i could properly hate you it's like matter i don't know how we do this like we have to answer  questions or something and then compare what your life was as a 26 year old to his there should be  some kind of psychiatric that's where we're pretty similar i think mother you weren't doing your own  laundry uh no i guess i was because i was already away from everybody doing radio but  i had no responsibilities just like he does there's gotta be he has no responsibility  dude there's gotta be a mother-son evaluation huh it's gotta be a mother-son evaluation some 
[00:40:30]  kind of psychiatric evaluation or a test or something i would that you two can take i would put my mother  on on the show in a second but it would just bum everyone out really maybe your mom your mom and  my mom even even bum out the hardcore listeners that nothing bothers them trust me your mom and my  mom could argue about uh my mom would keep your mom's ass in an argument proper child uh raising  yeah rearing rearing techniques i hate that what are you doing rearing your child well my mom would 
[00:41:00]  come in in a second she did every time she's called in she tells all her sisters and everybody oh i  called into the radio show today i was a big star very excited by it so yeah we got to compare somehow  i don't know how we do that and then see what happened with what it is when did you have to  start working well i started working when i was tell us when you do start jesus when did you have  to start working and bringing money home for the family not even for yourself i never had to bring 
[00:41:30]  money home for the family not even for yourself you never had a pitch in no i started working when i  was like 15 you were an allowance guy right well yeah i was never an allowance i had chores to earn  the allowance i know oh that's cute i had to i had to do chores to make sure i got a meal that night  full-time job 13 years old 20 of it had to go to my father oh yeah 20 every single  fucking cent went to my uh mom and then she would write it down a piece of paper like nope we're gonna 
[00:42:00]  pay you back see it's right here god it's like the beginning of fucking caddy shack i'm not that's  why hey i saw you take and i was a caddy so i could relate to that movie yes i worked all the money had  to go to the fucking house sam i worked at a trophy store and that's where i first learned about whoever  worked at a trophy the opie and anthony show oh wow whoa what what did you do at a trophy store i built  trophies oh god did you make one to take home world's best mom no i never did but i should have that 
[00:42:30]  that would have been a nice you know he did he probably did for mother's day yeah yeah yeah no  i know you're not telling us the truth i'm sure you brought a trophy home for bobby i'm telling you  i never made a trophy for anybody but uh selfish fuck yeah really but i just sit you have you have  the the you know the skills right there to bring home trophies for everybody i would sit in the back  room you could have gave your dad a trophy for world's best mustache ah i should have we had  engraving and everything oh did you engrave uh yeah i could use the engraving machine 
[00:43:00]  but we just do just take the big bolt throw it through the middle and put all the shit on it  and do it but you'd have to because everybody gets a trophy so when the little league uh needs trophies  you have to build you know 150 trophies for the little league how did you get that job that's a  job to have i don't know anybody that's kind of a cool job though i think how to deliver stupid  penny savers the woman who owned the store was my gym teacher's wife they talk about your penis and 
[00:43:30]  they all talked about my penis and they said we got to get this kid in the store get him in there  i got his penis while he's building trophies yeah make him make trophies and you got and you got to  keep all that money oh yeah i spent it at wrestling shows and stuff like that oh god yeah great that's  nice it was fun great wrestling toys magazines i started hiding money in a wall so i could run away  sand oh right okay oh i actually hid money in a wall in tinfoil you were plotting it was it was in 
[00:44:00]  tinfoil tinfoil you hid money in a wall and then what i did was i started by putting in the the  radiator or the radiator whatever you want to however you pronounce it yeah under the thing but  then i was paranoid that my money was gonna like set on fire or or it would be discovered if they ever  had to clean the radiators or something i don't know yeah so then i saw one day that the wallpaper  like there was an edge that kind of was up pulled away so i pulled it all away and i actually like i  was in prison drilled the hole not drilled but i made my own hole it's like andy dufresne yes 
[00:44:30]  definitely andy dufresne and then i was able to put my money in there and then and i got the  wallpaper back perfect that you couldn't tell and that's where i kept my money so i could run away  someday what say you fuzzy britches true story because every time i went into the house my my pockets  were empty yeah wow well i'll tell you this frisky so then i fucking would take a little taste for  myself in my in my socks and then i would give the rest to my mom when they were only a few hundred 
[00:45:00]  dollars collected for my big fucking runaway ski did you ever run away no man i just counted the  days until i was 18 well back when there were only five uh wwf pay-per-views a year oh i had to pay  for half the pay-per-view every time it came out of my own money please leave the studio what  i had to pay for half that's your pocket money yeah that's 15 that bummed you out right and i'm sure 
[00:45:30]  you made bobby suffer for making you do that no it was my dad's it was definitely my dad's call  really he was in charge of the finances no doubt god i hate you why do you hate me because you grew  up differently yeah you're spoiled i like you grew up spoiled i wasn't spoiled dude i've never heard  of anyone more spoiled than you in my entire life and i've been around a while i really i don't really  trying to think of anyone else that has been mothered like you have hmm i can't i can't come up  with one norman bates i came out of it on top though did you yeah i'm not spoiled you act like a spoiled 
[00:46:00]  kid really yeah way make fun of everybody yeah you do things without thinking there's any  consequence consequence or retribution or anything you just you just laugh and walk away because  no not you never had to pay any consequences growing up for any of your actions nobody everything  you did was accepted yeah as oh that's cute it's little sammy yeah yeah it's sam no i don't worry  about it everyone loves him he's just making jokes oh i could i can tell you it's just making 
[00:46:30]  jokes i could tell you another thing that we bought yesterday lives when you um when you have  a kid they like tags oh you notice right travis i don't know what this this phenomenon is but babies  love tags on anything yeah you don't even have to buy the toy just getting the tag i didn't think  you were tagging them at that age what in the ear or dorsal fin where you tag a baby but anything 
[00:47:00]  that has a tag let's say you have a little throw blanket or whatever they are obsessed with tags  okay so someone came up with the idea and we got one yesterday is a stuffed animal that just has a  million tags on it this is the shit they think of well that was someone is a millionaire for that too  it's like fake safe tags for a kid yeah there's this thing i don't have a good picture of it has  literally 10 to 12 tags on it that mean nothing they're not they're not the tag of the toy they're just 
[00:47:30]  add-on tags so the kid could obsessively play with tags now sounds like a good toy the first  one they tried was skin tags but the babies cried and didn't want to touch them they're gonna bring  big a home yeah my kid would love big a he's playing with my tags and uh yeah they got one of  those i know i know when babies like uh all of a sudden started liking keys they came out with a big  plastic keychain yeah but they still want they still want regular metal keys just put um don't uh 
[00:48:00]  tag around like the warden tag toys or something like that and it's got to see this it's the most  ridiculous thing tag toys yeah see like that thing oh oh i see and it's all sorts of different tags  like tags like that on the back of your t-shirt kind of all that stuff yeah they love tags not like a  price tag kind of a uh no on that little plastic choke no no you know how to wash a fucking garment  yeah yeah yeah what it's made of yeah there you go oh boy look at that it's a little thought of 
[00:48:30]  that it's got tags all over it they make those for dogs too we had one for dexter oh well that  probably wasn't for a dog it was for a baby but for your baby you treated your dog like a baby  well come on be honest they do share toys do you love dexter still oh i love dexter dexter's so  old fucking no no way i took a picture this morning before i left work yeah great he's the  best travis spoils his dog and his baby yeah amazing well you have nothing to say your mom  still spoils you sam you're 27 years old she tries to she does you take full advantage of it right

[00:55:00]  go to the bathroom we get a hot dog everything in there is old and the team just sucks a dick so  it's not even i i i i have i have what 15 games left something like that i'm just giving them away  i'm done i need another team to follow when you walk around in a nice new stadium the uh concourse or  whatever they want to call it that little thing it's when when you're at uh uh the union whatever 
[00:55:30]  whatever it is you have to burn a half a period let me jump in here this is the god's honest truth  when you go to an islanders game you have to burn a half a period to get food for everybody you have  to just burn it because i mean even the guys that come to your seats they don't have all the shit  that everywhere else has yeah every other arena and stadium has figured out where they got the guys  with the fucking thing what do you need ba ba ba here's your receipt somebody will run your food  down they don't even have that you're in you know like i'm way down near the ice i'm six seven rows 
[00:56:00]  from uh the ice gonna take a while but you have to burn a half a period because you have to get on a  shitty line there's not enough concession stands and get shitty food you know what it is every every  other stadium or whatever it is it looks nice when you're walking around there's like shops and  things on the newer ones it looks like like catacombs yeah it just looks like you're in the catacombs  it's it's damp and dank it's with cement walls that there's no the lighting isn't good long 
[00:56:30]  island is awful it's just an awful fucking place yeah born and raised but you know what are you  doing you just let this team rot well at the coliseum year after year well yeah they were four  and three they actually were uh you know leading their division what did they now we i think we got  officially the worst team in hockey nice you're close i think we're right there travis you got one  more point than the devils that was having a horrible year too but they have a great arena i love going  there like i mean you walk like oh look at all my choices and wow they're just waiting to help me 
[00:57:00]  you saw it because uh me and travis and his wife uh went to a canadians game recently how shitty is  that place i love going there because it's it's oh you love it because and here's the other thing  the canadians come to town to play the islanders guess what you think you're in montreal there's way  more fucking canadians fans and i don't blame them do they there's dozens of buses crazy there's no  one in the stands this year at the islanders game why would they even even opening night 
[00:57:30]  they it was i don't know close to half empty not even in loudville yeah loudville even is less loud  what is loudville just a just a shitty way to make it look like you're not in a shitty arena looking  at a shitty franchise loudville yeah our goalie is 41 and the other goalie has had so many operations  no one wants to acknowledge that he's a broken goalie at this point he's busted but he's busted  you only got what 12 years left on that deal yeah something like that he's played four games in two 
[00:58:00]  years and they're paying him in a ridiculous amount of money and then the guy rolls in who's you know  been around the league and he's a really good goalie but he's old now he can't fucking play every day  why does hockey sign people to such long fucking deals well he was you know he's a he was a  franchise player at the time we were all happy and then i think after he signed the contract he  walked out of the room and tripped and broke his fucking knee i think that's what happened i think  that's what started it fuck i want to follow hockey this year i need a team montreal jump on a bandwagon 
[00:58:30]  i i have no problem doing that i mean the players do it you know why not me jump on a bandwagon i might  fucking follow the flyers because they got family down there that's that's sacrilege that's sacrilege  sacrilege yeah whatever poor bastard and i had to ask stevie because the game started at 10 o'clock  last night so i go stevie islanders win last night lost in a shootout that's all he told me i wish he 
[00:59:00]  was lost in a shootout way to fucking work dummy uh people want my islanders tickets you can have them  what game you want rich i'm done come done he's just get this game next tuesday night i'm not going to  the coliseum to see a four and twelve team on a tuesday night when i have to get up at five  why don't you make stevie do something for some tickets i'll hand it fuck stevie you should earn  them no earn them it's a punishment going to the game so i want to punish him and i'll get this great 
[00:59:30]  oh fuck i gotta sit here and don man that's the shitty team and then the stupid politicians can't  figure it out that it would be nice for everybody to to get a nice uh new arena out there get some jobs  not only an arena they got a plan to make it a whole a whole nice thing out there a compound  compound where they have outdoor concerts and a and a mall and restaurants and all sorts of shit  it's a shithole over there clean it up yeah so whatever god damn and then once you cross the 
[01:00:00]  fucking road look out yeah i know it's a bad area on the other side so other side of the tracks as  they say what are we looking at the uh what's the name kovalchuk from uh the devils did you see  his shootout the other day no i did not this is great hang on oh good shootout uh you could say  uh oh yeah you could say that what what uh went wrong  everything 
[01:00:30]  now hang on oh no  fast forwarding for us  what are you doing oh he was the last guy  wow  travis has confidence sabers devil shootout  kovalchuk  100 million dollar player 
[01:01:00]  100 million dollar player that ended the game  really yeah yeah he was the last one  he never got a shot off  how do you not even get a shot off  he bobbled the fucking puck  he bobbled the puck it just it slowly went off to the right right off of his stick  oh that's hilarious  oh he just lost it  it got under his stick  oh shit what an asshole  good shot  that was great  oh that was like my man cow call 
[01:01:30]  that's how the goalie felt  we uh thank you  all right all these guys want islander tickets you're gonna you're gonna get them i'm giving away most of my tickets i'm so fucking done i ain't fucking dealing with this shit anymore  done and they raised the uh the ticket prices that's what you do  and the parking  and the parking  where there's grass growing out of the parking lot they could they couldn't even you know make it look like they did something to the parking lot just to find the the raise in the in the parking rates  you don't run out of that arena you're gonna sit in that  i know  for an hour  i know 
[01:02:00]  oh yeah  it's not a big doors fan unfortunately  i was never a big doors fan  you're missing some good music my friend  jim morrison played his last show 40 years ago today huh  i am  hence the doors

[01:04:30]  looking for some  some whiteness that i don't know about  yeah  and i watch a documentary about him  and  and um  i find out he's a very  yeah  important  like a very well respected  big time  been around  very successful  artist  yeah  he's a true artist  like a lot of these older guys  they  they don't really  do  you know  come up with new music  this guy is still pumping out an album every other year or something  but he didn't sell his soul  so that's why he never became  huh  he didn't sell his soul  so that's why he never became 
[01:05:00]  uh  he's huge  neil young's fucking  he's huge  but he's an artist  he never really was interested in the uh  mainstream success  i mean he has that but  but he doesn't  he didn't really care  he's he's respected  respected  he's famous for his the respect that he has  and and he has good songs  keep on rocking in the free world  a lot of hits  that was probably my last um  favorite song by him  keep on rocking in the free world  if that makes sense  and he has another one that's just long  then he's got like the old one 
[01:05:30]  just long  long  oh uh  cowgirl in the sand  that  and a  down by the river  a guy named  cardars  or fucking  some shit  are you talking about dylan  no  no no no  i'm confusing something  i think i'm talking about the animals right now  but but um  the animals  yeah that guy  what's his name  uh  dave johansen  no the singer from the animals  who's well respected too  oh yeah  that guy  yeah that guy  i keep forgetting these  eric burden  uh  eric burden 
[01:06:00]  yes  very respected uh  kid  war  that's edwin star  i don't give a shit  fuck  we're all  we're all over the place  with uh bands  but neil young man  i was  i was  i was impressed  oh eric burden  is uh  spill the wine  yeah  you ever hear spill the wine  spill the wine  take that  girl  i bet you he would hate your guts  why  for that being a song  right right  why what else has he done  oh man  he fucking  rising sun  house of the rising sun  house of the rising sun 
[01:06:30]  uh don't let me be misunderstood  first time i was ever at a strip club  uh she danced to house of the rising sun  wonderful  so every time i hear house of the rising sun  it brings me back to that mess on the stage  this just reminds me of boogie nights  he's one of the soulful uh white boys back then  party scene in boogie nights motherfucker  spill the wine  yeah yeah  roll it girls  fucking  he's uh he's uh he's another excellent uh  and the guy talked through this song  he didn't he never sang i don't think  who  the big hook i think was somebody else  he's rapping the black man ripped him off 
[01:07:00]  that's right  we don't have to go down this road with the spill the wine  it's just that it's uh neil young's 65th birthday today  that's a biggie  it's been around forever  where's crosby stills in mass  that's very young in white years  he's he's still got a good 45 50 years ago  he well he's a rock guy though  so i'll give him at least 10  i'll give him maybe another 10  i liked his career  i i enjoyed that that documentary  i liked i like what he was uh

[01:13:00]  i couldn't make out  the beginning of that one  they just suck  yeah unfortunately  the audio is not the best  i wish it was a little  better but what  we tried to beef it up  a little bit so it's not  so far away and hollow  but it doesn't  they did the most  they can  dryer fires can be deadly  that part 
[01:13:30]  yeah  dryer fires can be deadly  dryer fires  how many times  did that happen  every once in a while  every once in a while  you guys had dryer fires  i had to put out  a dryer fire once  nice  i swear yeah  somebody's  it wasn't the lint though  it was uh  somebody's bra was in the wash  and like that underwire  got like caught on the drum  and it was preventing it  from spinning  oh shit  so the motor was working  but the drum wasn't spinning  and it overheated  and i actually  i actually had to  like i saw fire  like it was like go time 
[01:14:00]  i was like fuck  what do i do  where's the fire extinguisher  put it out  i felt like the man  i felt like a hero  oh yeah  i saved the whole house  from burning down  nice  and the whole entire house  was covered in that yellow shit  for like three years  i know  you never want to  fucking  the extinguisher  just fuck the house up  you never want to  pull a trigger  on an extinguisher  i did it for a bat once  and i saw powder  for like you just said  it's years later  you hold it  you hold that extinguisher down  for like three seconds  and that shit gets  it's everywhere  everywhere 
[01:14:30]  it's amazing  you ever do that  it's the CO2 one  you ever put a trigger  on a fire  you might as well  let your shit burn  might as well  it's probably less clean up  yeah the clean up  is a fucking nightmare  why are you using  yeah there was a bat  in my kitchen  so i decided  to try to take it out  with the fire extinguisher  with a chemical extinguisher  oh yeah man  you gotta use CO2 extinguisher  i know  it was the white powder one  i didn't know  what kind of fucking  fire extinguisher  i thought it would  dazed a little fucker  dazed  we finally got in  a bath towel  yeah 
[01:15:00]  but there was powder  everywhere  the place you live now  nah this is years ago  it was the same bat  that was  when i was sleeping  on the couch  couch became my friend  whoops  and one night  i felt this thing  over my head  i'm like that's  you're just crazy  there's nothing  over your head  sure enough  the next morning  the bat was in the corner  it was just circling  over my head  all fucking night long  and it was dark  i just felt like 
[01:15:30]  something was up there  and i'm like  you're a crazy person  woke up and there  it was in the corner  because now it's daylight  doesn't like moving around  as much  anything bigger than an inch  is just scary  yeah  yeah  you're right  anything huge  is just something  you can't  you're even scared  to step on  don't like that  bats will freak me  the fuck out  bats  they move too fast  and they move weird  that's the thing  they come right at you  and then the last minute  they'll wear off  from your face  very unpredictable  how they move  that's what i hate  about them  mice i can handle 
[01:16:00]  cockroaches i can handle  rats i can't handle  either  that just fucking  things that move  and just have  personality  i don't mind  ants  ants  sometimes  somehow ants  i like  you can't see a little  ant face  i don't kill them  i just  yeah  it's like they kill  things that shouldn't  be there  yeah  they scare things  and spiders too  spiders are creepy  motherfucking things  i will kill a spider  in a second  i don't fuck with spiders  um i don't fuck with  flies anymore really  oh fuck  i will kill a fly 
[01:16:30]  i catch flies  i chase flies around  my house  it'll be like a half  hour with a rolled  up magazine  just like  my head  my head looks like  i got parkinson's  i'm trying to fly  i'm trying to follow  this fucking fly  that's impossible  and then  yeah  occasionally i i get  and then i feel really  good about myself  i catch them  yeah  yeah  because i saw  i think it was  catch and release  i i saw muhammad  where did i get this  story from  somebody help me out  i saw somebody  catch a fly once 
[01:17:00]  with your hands  and  it's possible  they can't  wait  how  you got to get  them you know  head on  from the front  yeah  because they can't  go backwards  obviously  it's really easy  yeah they got to  kind of take off  and fly into your  hands  and when you do it  people are amazed  but it's actually  really easy  if you line them up  or you're facing  directly at them  flies are weird  because they can't  really move  you know left or right  or backwards  they got to jump  up and move  all the years  i've looked at them  i've never noticed  that they couldn't  do that  no they're just  really fast 
[01:17:30]  they are fast  motherfuckers  i learned sharks  can't swim backwards  from deep blue sea  the movie  yeah they  they'll drown  if they stop  sam jackson goes  they can't do that  they can't do that  yeah  sam jackson got his  comeuppance in that  one  holy shit  he's standing there  he's standing there  preaching  no they  yeah they  take off and shit  i didn't know that  shit  you ever go to  grab one and know  you fucking got it  and then you slowly  open your hand to see  him and he's not there 
[01:18:00]  right  it's like a magic trick  they certainly can fly  sideways and down  they can't take off  sideways  is what i'm getting at  i think they can make  sharp turns  when they get up  in the air  what the fuck is  the fuck you learn  is from  i forget but i  i saw it somewhere  i'm like wow  this is a trick  i'm gonna use  for the rest of my  life and impress  people  bill nye  i want to say  it was muhammad ali  or something  where he was  showing his  quickness by  catching flies  or maybe it was  in the rocky  movies  i don't fucking  if i do catch  a fly in my  hand though  i will throw it 
[01:18:30]  as hard as i can  at the floor  or the wall  and before you  open it up  yeah  and then he's  so stunned  that you could  just stomp  on them  i hate fucking  flies and bugs  the worst though  is a mosquito  in your house  i kill those now  and you'll look  at that fucking  thing  they will just  they will always  bite you  they will figure  out where you  are  doesn't matter  where  you're gonna  have an inch  of skin  that is poking  out of your  fucking blankets  how do they  get through  jeans  like sometimes  you're fucking  scratching your  leg and go  the mosquito  bit me  through my 
[01:19:00]  fucking jeans  i hate how  like they all  know like where  the first one  bit you  so that they  all kind of  group  they make  groupings  around the first one  like five mosquito  bites in one  place  i had 20  on my ankle  yeah i was gonna  that's exactly what i  was gonna say  why always the  ankles  because it hurts  the most  yeah  you can take it  you can take a  mosquito bite to  the thigh  that's easy  that seems to go  away a lot faster  than when you get  the ankles  and i don't seem to  get like regular  mosquito bites  like every time i  get a mosquito bite  it's like the size 
[01:19:30]  of like a nickel  oh and it's shaped  like fucking like  missouri  or something like  what happened to  just the one little  round mosquito bite  that doesn't happen  anymore  sometimes they're  shaped like a  mr potato head  just a giant  fucking hate that  shit  anything worse than  hearing that mosquito  in your room at  night knowing it  there's no way  you're gonna be  able to get it  oh cause it's like  and then it goes  right by your ear  and then you gotta  sleep in the summer  heat with the blanket  over your head  cause of a fucking  bug in your room  well fuck you  but you know what

[01:22:00]  would  if we had a  better quality  clip of that  but the hall of  fames are  that's the reason  they're in the  hall of fame  and dear people  who are going  to send news  teasers in  don't just record  it off of your  TV like that  guy just did  the ones that  we just played  it's really terrible  yeah please make  it good quality  if you can  we'd appreciate  it  dummy  alright  so the cruise  ship is back  yeah they towed  it into San  Diego  people got off  of it and  were complaining  some people  were hugging 
[01:22:30]  and crying  like I guess  a lot of elderly  were on this  cruise  and they showed  like a couple  of people hugging  on the dock  and crying  it's like  they were without  fucking some  power and hot  water  it's not the  titanic  survival  is a motherfucker  no showers  and no mayonnaise  well not no mayonnaise  they were eating  mayonnaise sandwiches  I mean  they say it only  takes three days  for chaos  it sucks  I believe that  it sucks  but they actually  had better food 
[01:23:00]  than first reported  fruits and vegetables  the spam  they didn't give  them the spam  look I know  most people  don't want to eat  that every day  but you're not  suffering by eating  fruits and vegetables  while they tow you  back into San Diego  Bay  it fucked up  but it wasn't  it wasn't fucking  listing  and water  coming over the bow  like they're hugging  like she just  fucking got off  on a little life  for a boat  on the Titanic  it was an old  people crew  old people crew  yeah  oh okay  some people died  no  no one died  nothing 
[01:23:30]  it wasn't all  old people  because I heard  some young guy  say that he felt  a shudder  felt a shudder  like there was  an earthquake  in the ship  and then everything  just went  there was some  kind of explosion  in the engine room  I'd have been  just walking around  crying  holding bitches  holding bitches  we're gonna die  people die  there's no way  they're gonna come  out here and save us  let's just do it  one last time  here on the ship  it wasn't the  Poseidon adventure  yeah  they were watching  it's upright 
[01:24:00]  they ran out of  power and hot water  who gives a shit  which is why  I hate flying  it's just  yeah  you just  like my fucking  remote control  on my TV  just stops working  out of nowhere  and you just  be like  you're in a machine  30,000 feet up  it just stops  sometimes on a plane  you start thinking  about all the wires  and machines  and then even  when they go to  like in one of  the older planes  when they used to  actually pop a  videotape in  to watch shit  and like there'd be 
[01:24:30]  a problem  like they couldn't  get it to work  and you'd see two  of the fucking  flight attendants  trying to get it  to work  trying to get  anything to work  I'm just like  you know what  this is not working  on this plane  leave it alone  because it's one  less thing  that'll burst  into fucking flames  just shut it off  so the ship  is just  luckily  it's whatever  it is  it's in the water  can you imagine  just being in that  hot  it was no air conditioning  they said  yeah but it's a  non-story  nothing happened  in the end  I'm sure the news  was hoping that  there was death  and all that  they're investigating 
[01:25:00]  right now  what is that  I have no idea  what is CNN showing  someone's trying  to make a transformer  oh is that  what that is  I don't know  someone's trying  to make some  kind of a  mechanical device  we get distracted  we have way too  many TVs in here  I would  I mean  you'd get  fucked up  with that shit  though  you would imagine  it leads to my  question  I learned this  summer  we were down  on vacation  when a hurricane  truly was going  to hit exactly  where we were  and I learned  there's two  types of people  the one type  they don't want  anything to do  with it  and want out 
[01:25:30]  immediately  and then there  was the other  side  which was me  and my brother  and a few other  people  where you want  to kind of  hang out  and check it  out  you want a  little adventure  you want to  make sure  your family's  safe  sure  so you kind  of calculate  which one  are you  in terms of  what  I would love  to be on  that cruise  ship  that got  all fucked  up  just to see  what happens  yeah  it'd be a  story  it would be  an adventure  I don't know  I mean  this is not  fucking CBS  it's like  I wouldn't  want to be  on there  because 
[01:26:00]  you know  you're not  sure what  the fuck  is going  to happen  you're not  sure  if somebody's  going to  come get  you  so this  is not  like  Survivor  so if  I'm not  sure  if somebody's  going to  get one  off of  that  fucking  boat  you don't  fucking  know  nothing  hold on  fucking  where's  some coal  miners  locked up  for 30  days  or whatever  they gotta  tow you in  let me  explain  not many  people alive  would disagree  with you  but let's  say  the ship 
[01:26:30]  goes bad  and you  have no  doubt in  your mind  that you  know  they're coming  to get you  and everything's  gonna be  cool  wouldn't you  just ride it  out and go  this is an  adventure  I've done  that in  the house  before where  I've just  I've seen  like you  know I've  had a week  off  and I mean  off  nothing  you know  all the bills  paid  everything  it's like  an off  week of  anything  and I just  lay there  to see  how putrid  everything  can be  like I  don't take  a shower  I fucking  leave dirty 
[01:27:00]  dishes  and it's  just  lay in  your own  filth  see the  fucking  muck  are you  an adventure  guy  or are you  a I don't  want to be  bothered by  any of this  shit  no I'm  an adventure  guy  I like  a little  bit of  catastrophe  because like  the hurricane  this summer  I knew  without a doubt  that we  weren't gonna  fucking die  over this  fucking thing  so I  wanted to ride  it out  and check  it out  I've never  been that  close to  a hurricane  where  it was  down in  North Carolina  it was  definitely  not gonna  hit exactly  where we  were  we were  gonna get  the outer  bands  which would  be a  pretty cool 
[01:27:30]  ride  I was in  the Bahamas  when Katrina  came over  the Bahamas  yeah  I was in  the Bahamas  it came  over us  but it  wasn't  it wasn't  really kick  ass yet  and  wasn't that  kind of  cool  yeah it  was in  the pool  and it's  fucking  hurricane  and shit  I'm in  the pool  at fucking  Atlantis  this is  fucking  ridiculous  I don't  want to  know about  any of that  horseshit  you don't  huh  hurricanes  how about  an easier  one  when we  all live  kind of  around  New York  City  right  when they  start talking  about these  snowstorms 
[01:28:00]  that come  through  don't you  want like  just a  ridiculous  snowstorm  or are you  this guy  like fuck  why is this  thing hitting  New York  City  I love  bad weather  I don't  like  I don't  want to  have  anything  catastrophic  but there  are people  that got  so bummed  out  and I'm  like let  it  fucking  snow  I want  to see  10 feet  of snow  in one  storm  I love  rain and  snow  and all  that shit  because you  know you're  going to  survive that  you know what  the sickest  thing is  I mean this  is I think  worse than  an earthquake  volcano  any other  natural disaster  because I 
[01:28:30]  hadn't seen  one till  that big  one  fucking  tsunami  being stuck  in that  when they  showed that  that water  all pulled  out  and people  were on the  beach  and you  just saw  them get  completely  wiped  out  I would  so not  be beach  guy  I would  know  something  is about  to happen  but you  know what  I never  forgot  the first  thing I  thought of  is how  dead I  would be  because  it ain't  like  in the  movies  those  fucking  things  to me  those are 
[01:29:00]  the scariest  things ever  in a movie  is the  giant  wave  the giant  wave  horrifies me  but  during the  tsunami  it  looked like  you could  live  it wasn't  a giant  wave  it was  just a  lot of  water  water  just kind  of rose  up real  quick  but it  killed  a lot  of  motherfuckers  look at  that  that's  scary  a guy  is surfing  a wave  that is  as big  as a  fucking  building  what is  this video 
[01:29:30]  Danny  it's called  crazy  motherfucker  oh  struck  in  tsunami  is the  video title  on youtube  that's  that's  a wave  the tsunami  was a  wall  was the  it was just  like  the whole ocean  water came  yeah the ocean  just came up  on everything  that wasn't waves  that wave is  50  how many  how many feet  it's gigantic  that guy must have  he's been surfing  for a half a mile  already  yeah where is he  how did he get that  far into the ocean  helicopter  he's so fucked 
[01:30:00]  no this guy knows  exactly what he's doing  how the fuck did he  get through that  I don't know  that's the best  surfer I've ever  seen in my life  yeah check it out  for yourself man  when you get  in front of  that was bigger  than any  hawaii 50 wave  that that's the  thing that  that's the  that's the thing  that when I  think of disasters  I don't  I'm not scared  of meteorites  lightning  fucking none  but just a  wall of  fucking water  is just  deep  I'm right with you  was it deep  deep impact 
[01:30:30]  yeah  had one  that was really  good  yeah  day after tomorrow  had a good one  oh  is that  that tsunami  that's the tsunami  well that's like  that's just a big  that's just a wave  that's kind of a  mini tsunami  where's the tsunami  I mean  the original video  obviously was posted  on Ogrish  which leads me to  believe that this  won't end well  true  oh this is Ogrish  yeah the cars are  moving okay  this is a bad one  remember the last  big rainstorm  why would you  why would you walk 
[01:31:00]  out into where  the water used to  be just because  it sucked out  people don't  understand  because you don't  fucking know  they don't understand  that when the water  goes out  it's coming back  that can't be good  do you know  if you look in the sky  if you see a hole  in a cloud  that means that  there's going to be  an asteroid  that's going to come down  yeah you'd be looking  at the hole in the cloud  nah I just lied  yeah yeah yeah  but if you don't  fucking know  you don't fucking know  but how do you  not know  why should you know  if the water's gone  you see fish  all of a sudden  you see the water gone  you're thinking 
[01:31:30]  oh this is okay  let's go look for shells  you think it's low tide  get the fuck out of here  this shit always happens  no the water sucks out  dramatically  when people don't have food  like this shit  always happens  with poor people  where it's like  oh shit  zit  like the volcano  all the lava  went back into the volcano  and it's cooked chickens  on the edge  of the fucking volcano  they don't fucking know  that this is getting ready  to explode  so if you're missing  there's gotta be fish  just flapping  I don't know 
[01:32:00]  I don't know everything  but if the water's  suck it out  I would have no doubt  that this can't be good  and something is gonna happen  that maybe I shouldn't  be that close  but would you go  I'm gonna fucking leave  yeah  that I would  I would be like  yeah this is not good at all  I would try to find  some high ground  so I could still check it out  do you have the thing  with the one guy  where the family  was just filming  this one pebble  of a guy  oh man  and he was just  fucking disco dancing  and he was there  and then he wasn't  slammed  I would have been him 
[01:32:30]  dead  easily  yeah  this water  didn't  like there's the wave  it's a little wave  it's not that big  but then  the water just keeps  coming up  yeah look at this  like the tsunami  is not scary  it's still not scary looking  it's just the volume  of water coming  it's just the mass  of all that water  that's what I'm saying  you know the water  has to come back  it's not gonna come back  nicely  and most of the people  died because  there was buses  like the water 
[01:33:00]  had them  so they were  they were hanging  yeah  but there was also  a bus  on top of them  so they couldn't  get the fuck up  because it was a  floating bus  it takes a bunch  of shit with it  and just the water  alone is so  it's so powerful  like put it this way  like take a gallon  of milk  and throw it  at someone's face  that's gonna hurt  right  yeah it certainly is  take like a million  of those  and throw it  at someone's face  but not even that hard  look here  comes the big wave  oh that's like  a big fucking  yeah I would know  that's coming  I just would know  does that still look 
[01:33:30]  dangerous  that doesn't look  dangerous  it looks like  if you went back  like where this camera  is you'd be fine  yeah this looks  fantastic  oh really  it looks fantastic  and then it's gonna  and then you're like  oh it's gonna go back  it's about a 12 foot  wave that hit right  and you're still  going home  and now this person  starts freaking out  just now  that's an intelligent  person  ah shit  now I wouldn't mind  being on the roof  of a building  and seeing that  I'm into it  I'd be afraid  the building  is gonna collapse  I probably would've  been stupid enough  to be where he was  filming this  thinking it's  that's where my 
[01:34:00]  knowledge would end  I would say  alright get up a little  higher and check it out  and that's probably  where my problem  would be  and that is the number  one  I would absolutely  get off the fucking  beach though  I think this is  the number two  this earthquake  that caused that  was the number two  of all time  yeah yeah  it was huge  earthquake  and then the one  in the  is it Columbia  I don't know  not sure  somewhere  it's two  was it Columbia  oh no Chile  Chile has the top  in the top three  yeah  but like  2,000 people died  cause nothing really 
[01:34:30]  happened  yeah this is like  fucking  I listen  million people  fucking crazy  Colin Quinn's walking  down the hall  so why don't we  take a break  so we can set up  nice for Colin  and continue the show  he's a big star  now  I brought up  the cruise ship  thing cause some  idiot came up  with a song  about it  oh right  we can play next  for Patrice  and Colin Quinn  we'll do that  you could tell  it was people  that were on  the ship  right  and they're  all laughing  and they go  let's write  let's uh  you know  get a Gilligan's  Island song  it's horrible  oh it's terrible  you wanna do it  really fast

[01:40:00]  how great would that be  I wanna be the I have to get out of here guy  he's got a publicist  how great is that  alright we'll take a break  and we'll talk to Colin Quinn next  the big Broadway star  this is the Opie and Anthony show  Sirius XM  I'm going back to Brooklyn  Brooklyn  Brooklyn  I'm going back to Brooklyn  I don't think so  I'm going back to Brooklyn  Brooklyn  Brooklyn  I'm going back to Brooklyn  man I don't think so 
[01:40:30]  I'm going back to Brooklyn  crying  denying  shying  blow drying  trying to fit in  going back home  Coming back a hero where the girls look like Madonna and the guys sound like De Niro.  The top is down on that guy's T-Bird and he's listening to the latest disco.  Gold year ain't big chains, t-shirt and his hair held down with Crisco.  Now his girlfriend's cute but I can't look over cause it might start an ugly rumor. 
[01:41:00]  If they hear blues talk around my body, they'll throw a chore.  He's like Andy Dice Clay without a sense of humor.  I'm going back to Brooklyn.  We get it.  Colin Quinn in studio.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Patrice making the first observation.  This is, what are you calling Colin?  This is scheduled Colin.  This is Colin's schedule. 
[01:41:30]  And I'm a big fan of schedule Colin.  Yeah, we never scheduled you, right Patrice?  You know what, I have never been a scheduled guest where I had to go somewhere.  Colin Quinn is scheduled today to appear on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Colin's looking spry, he's looking clean, he's looking healthy.  He used to come down in his pajamas.  In his jammies, he would come in.  Cause he was pissed off about something he heard on our show.  Oh yeah, no, I was pissed.  I'll tell you one of the reasons, I still remember one of the things that pissed me off the most  and it's going to make you sick to your stomach. 
[01:42:00]  They were on the show, Norton's sitting there pontificating, you know what I mean?  And then he goes like this, he goes, I mean, and he wasn't being, I promise you he was  not trying to be funny and he goes, you know, it's like 6.15 in the morning, I'm listening  to the show and he goes, I mean, you know, a great love song like Mark Anthony, what was  that Mark Anthony song?  Oh shit.  That big hit.  Oh, I have no fucking idea.  Yeah.  Fucking knows.  He had one big hit, but he goes, I mean, that's a good love song.  And then he keeps talking.  I just had to come down. 
[01:42:30]  But he's just this idiot's going, that's a great love song.  Like, that's a given.  With no jokes after that.  Even thinking about it.  No, he meant it.  I want to strangle him right now thinking about it.  And all of a sudden Colin appeared pretty much in his PJs.  Yeah.  His hair was fucked up.  Yeah.  But that was lonely Colin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We went through the period with him.  Yeah.  He was frustrated.  I remember, I said it the other day, you weren't here, where you would come in, rant  and like, I have all these writings and stuff in my apartment. 
[01:43:00]  I don't know what to do with it.  I need someone to organize this stuff.  But now, but hold on.  But he organized one of them.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Let's not try to.  He's focused though.  Colin's publicist is getting angry that we brought that up.  Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  We agreed not to talk about that.  That's Adrian.  She's a writer.  She's not a publicist.  No, that's a publicist.  We know.  We know how you work.  She's not a publicist.  No, she's a publicist.  We're not allowed to talk about.  Can't talk about remote control anymore.  Did you guys really get a list from somebody?  No, but it would be funny if you could.  You should get a list now.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Did you see his face? 
[01:43:30]  He didn't even know.  Colin has a dirty publicist, a Broadway publicist.  Dirty publicist.  And here's what he's going to have to do.  He's going to have to show up places.  I've already had to.  Photo ops.  And that's why I'm getting sick right now by you guys.  Because somehow, narrative.  He cannot.  He can't be curmudgeon Colin.  Colin, he has to fucking go out and fucking say hi and be Broadway-y.  That's it.  Are you Broadway Colin?  He has to shake veiny hands.  Oh, the heck.  Yeah.  You think he's Broadway Colin now?  Oh, he has to shake these fucking Crypt Keeper hands. 
[01:44:00]  So, Jerry is directing.  So, how is that?  Tell me how the Jerry signs him.  Mr. and Mrs. Spugelsteen.  That fucking Spugelsteen.  That Bill's fucking wings on hospitals are coming to see him now.  And it's shitty.  You think there's some old school Broadway people?  He's in that world now?  Oh, yeah.  And Colin can't be, like, fucking cynical.  No, no.  Because when you're doing a one-man show in the comic, it's really just an hour and a half of your material that wasn't funny. 
[01:44:30]  Like, the people go, I was in Montreal doing my one-man show, but it was just like, this is my material that ain't that good.  And now, fucking, he's a genius.  He can't fucking be fucking pissed off Colin.  He has to say thank you.  He has to be there on time.  Magnanimous.  He's got to be all nice.  And now we're all going to fall in line because Colin is the fearless leader.  But can I just say one thing before he continues on this legitimate trashing on me? 
[01:45:00]  He doesn't say legitimate good.  Do you see how the black mind thinks?  He's like, he thinks all these years I haven't been on time.  He's like, he's got to be on time.  He's got to be nice.  He's projecting his worst nightmare.  I've always been nice and I've always been on time.  But it's absolutely not true.  Really?  This is why Colin desperately, he's in the middle of black angst. 
[01:45:30]  And white acceptance.  And he wants to have black angst and white acceptance.  But you're not allowed to have both.  Let's not waste too much time on this because he only has five more minutes.  Oh shit, you're right.  Before he has to move on to his next interview.  How's he going?  Where are you going next, Colin?  He's taking the whole XM box or Regis.  Remember the days it was just us and you, Kyle.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's Colin Quinn with his one-man show.  I'll give him a big hand.  So Colin, what the heck is all this about?  No more ridicule of bums like Regis.  It sounds like some kind of history class with laughs. 
[01:46:00]  He goes, bums like Regis.  Regis filming a bum.  He is a bum.  We still think he's a bum.  Just like you used to think he was a bum.  You deserve it though, brother.  You deserve it.  No one's saying it.  You fucking deserve it, man.  I deserve what?  You deserve accolades.  I deserve this left-handed compliment.  No.  What you're saying?  Hey, you stink now.  You sell out.  But you deserve it.  Good for you.  With your shitty material.  You said.  You said.  I didn't say this. 
[01:46:30]  I wasn't doing this.  I said one-man shows.  I just.  When comics do one-man shows, they're just material.  It's seriousness.  Not my stupid standard.  What I do?  No.  And I love the name.  The story's short.  Matter of fact, I was going to name my one-hour Comedy Central special.  Yeah.  An Evening with Mr. P.  But I changed it because I was like, Colin's fucking name of his thing is so good.  Yeah, it really is.  And short.  Long story short, it's fucking a great, it's such a great title. 
[01:47:00]  If I don't start doing this kind of shit and taking care of myself, I'll end up on  a month-long tour of Canada.  That's the last place I'm on.  With some of these comics.  Fucking Time Magazine.  I'm talking about Robert Kelly.  I was trying to change his everything to Bob Kelly and his tour of Canada.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking locked in.  It's Canadian tour.  Let me ask Colin.  So the show pops on Broadway, and then you had to read the reviews the next day.  Were you out of your mind going, holy shit, what are they going to say about  this?  It turned out everyone's loving the show and the reviews are great.  There was one woman we found that did like a two and a half star, and that's not bad 
[01:47:30]  either, if you're going to get a bad review.  Time Magazine was good.  I tweeted that your picture looked like Hitler at Nuremberg.  Your hands are up like this, your mouth's open, you're yelling.  You're looking at the sky.  It's like you're talking about book burnings.  It's fantastic.  I like the fact that only Anthony knows Hitler at Nuremberg.  Everybody else would go Hitler, but he's like Hitler.  No, no.  It was a special Hitler movie.  I'm like...  I'm like...  I'm like...  I'm like...  I'm like Roland with Springsteen about Hitler, I know. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, I've seen him so many times.  God, I know his set list.  I hate the Jews.  Evil shmeevil.  Fuck the Soviets.  Oh, and then he plays a different set every night.  Anecdote about Eva Braun.  Yeah, yeah.  And then he's back to the Soviets again.  All right, so what have we established?  That I stink?  No, no, no.  How's that for fucking big news?  This is big buzz, man.  This is big time.  We can't do that to you, Colin.  This is big news.  We're all excited for Colin's win.  Here's the thing about the business that's amazing.  It's like you're always... 
[01:48:30]  Colin was this guy.  I've seen his HBO half hour when they did him from like Coconut Grove or something.  And he was ahead of his time.  Colin, this is nothing for Colin.  And it's just catching up with Colin.  Colin's been 10 years to 15 years ahead of his contemporary white, hacky, red guys that he's with.  He's always been fucking above them.  But now he's like, he's 10 years...  Tough crowd was 10 years ahead. 
[01:49:00]  And now this is 10 years ahead.  Oh, yeah.  Tough crowd was 10 years ahead.  You're absolutely right.  It was 10 years ahead.  Because now everyone's doing tough crowd.  Everybody's doing tough crowd light.  Because now it's safer to do it now.  But I know this is 10 years ahead.  So, Colin, what's happening in 10 years?  Help us out.  Help us out.  What should we do?  What should we start working on?  I want to buy stock right now.  But now his 10 years ahead.  Here's the thing.  And this is what happened to Mike Tyson.  It's like, it's a kind of mellowed out, like, approachable dude.  And they're giving him good reviews now for his 10 years ahead. 
[01:49:30]  And then Buster Douglas is going to come in and punch his face.  But I'm like, you see, Tyson is like, kind of like, he said, I'm, you know, he's mellowed.  And he's a little, you can touch him.  And now it's like, now it's like, you know what I'm saying?  I know Colin's really big because I saw a video recently where Jerry calls him Carl.  Hey, Carl.  Wow.  Jerry's a bad motherfucker.  He's taking care of people.  Papa?  Colin?  I think one of your publicists put the video out there of Colin getting his show ready.  Don't say Papa first.  Say Colin first. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Colin?  But Jerry wanted to talk to Colin about something.  He goes, hey, Carl, what if?  There was a what if after.  You got to see the video.  He said Carl, though.  Who was telling us a Seinfeld horror story the other day?  Bobby Kelly?  That's the famous one.  It was somebody that had run into Jerry or had seen somebody that was Jerry.  And Jerry's just like, hey, can I get a picture?  And Jerry's like, no.  No.  No.  Happens all the time.  I fucking really love that guy, man. 
[01:50:30]  No.  He's a zillionaire.  He walks the streets alone.  Yeah, yeah.  And no bodyguard.  I just.  It's amazing to me, man.  The thing with Jerry is, I told you, he's so.  I was at the cell last week, two weeks ago, and Tracy Morgan was there.  And he walks in.  Yo, I'm an asshole.  Keith.  He starts cursing, acting Tracy.  Jerry came in.  Hi, Tracy.  Jerry, how are you?  He can turn Tracy white.  How's Dirty Rock, Tracy? 
[01:51:00]  It's going well, Jerry.  Thank you very much.  It's going well.  Yes.  You got normal Tracy.  Hey, Jerry, it's Southfile.  It's Southfile.  What you doing?  Yeah, why doesn't he do that to Jerry?  Jerry just looked at him.  Hi, Tracy.  Oh, that's all it's like, Jerry.  Hi, Jerry.  Intimidating whiteness thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck, man.  So we should get the plug in, man.  Colin Quinn's on Broadway.  Oh, my God.  You sons of bitches.  How do you fucking trash me?  Oh, no.  It's at the Helen Hayes Theater.  You got the Al Pacino across the street, but we're not going to acknowledge that. 
[01:51:30]  Why not?  I went to see Al in Merchant of Venice last week.  Did you?  How was the Merchant of Venice?  Fantastic.  Yeah, is he good in that?  I think Al is really one of our finest actors.  Oh, shit.  Is he an American institution?  They got him.  They got him.  Look for the score.  A pound of flesh.  Yeah, yeah.  They got him.  He's a Broadway star.  Were you just hanging out with Al?  Two Broadway stars hanging out?  They really happened to drive in that show.  I didn't realize how they went after them.  Yeah, yeah.  Shylock.  Oh, they brutalized them.  There's not even a...  You know who else is in it?  Jesse Martin from Law and Order is one of the guys. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  Yeah, I've seen him.  I didn't know he was a Broadway guy.  Yeah.  Fuck that show.  I want to talk about...  Yeah, we don't want to talk about your show.  Stop being uncomfortable.  We're trying to pump up your show.  I don't want to get uncomfortable.  Colin just got fucked up.  Also, he talked about Al Pacino.  He just got media training, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He got media training.  Did you get media training?  He gave me a two-hour media training session.  What a fucking asshole.  That's what he'd do.  Colin's like a rookie linebacker from fucking Oklahoma now.  We never get the inside when it comes to this. 
[01:52:30]  What do they teach you?  Yeah, what is media training?  They teach you to keep saying...  You're supposed to keep saying the name of the show.  Long story short, you're supposed to say telecharge.  You're supposed to say, you know, at the Helen Hayes Theater.  And no matter what they ask you, you've got to figure out how to get it back to talking  about the show, right?  Yeah.  That's what fucking Brett did yesterday.  That fucking would not let anything happen.  Nope.  Nope.  Other than Skyline.  Nope.  Brett Rattner.  Rattner.  Oh.  Yeah, he's directing or producing a movie.  I know.  Yeah.  I'm back in the business.  I know.  I know. 
[01:53:00]  They asked me to play a part in that.  But I refused.  Do you find there's a difference 15 years ago till now?  Like you, where you're like, you're embracing like the thing you kind of got to do, I guess,  which is not...  I'm not embracing it, but I mean, I'm definitely more like, I got to do, you know what I mean?  I got to show up places, like you said.  I got to be.  You can't just fucking do what you do, which is what I always did, you know, which is to 
[01:53:30]  be, you know, almost agoraphobic and, you know, just show up when you want.  I mean, let's face it.  If you're not making the same mistakes I've made in my career, who the hell is?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  You burn fucking bridges.  Which is what I named my comedy spills.  This is Bridge Burner.  Bridge Burner.  Oh, that's awesome.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  I like that.  You are.  You burn bridges like the Sherman, General Sherman.  I don't want to bring up a touchy subject with you, the Civil War, but...  So you're understanding the game a little more, huh, Colin? 
[01:54:00]  Well, that's...  I always understood the game.  But you're playing the game more.  I just couldn't fucking believe, and I still can't believe...  That you have to.  That I got to stand around, and that, you know, I'm still mad.  I mean, I'm still mad as ever.  Now, do every show, do you have to fucking say hi to some people that...  No, I don't mind that part.  That's not what I'm saying.  But I'm saying, do you kind of have to?  Like, can you not...  Can you go...  I'm done...  Do you just get on the bus and go home afterwards and go home?  That's the second way.  He's got to shake some hands.  No, I got to go out and say a shit.  I mean, I don't really have to do that much.  No, that was never the part. 
[01:54:30]  I'm trying to figure out what it was where I took those steps.  I think it was more like...  I think I did more like you.  Like, I'd have a casual meeting with somebody in power,  and I'd feel like the way you feel,  which is, you're lucky to have me here,  and we're equals,  when really they had all the money and all the power.  And that's how you are, in my opinion.  Is you're like, yeah, of course we're here.  I belong here, me and Spielberg.  We're equal.  I belong here, me and Spielberg. 
[01:55:00]  Spielberg.  Spielberg.  Spielberg.  True that.  So that's what I'm saying.  I think it was more like...  But that's why I watch you to...  I get the cue.  Because Colin is a...  He knows how to do it.  But I was always more pleasant.  I mean, let's face the facts.  You were more likable.  You weren't more pleasant.  You know, he makes a difference.  He doesn't make a point.  People like Colin, but he's not a pleasant man.  Not pleasant.  I'm the most pleasant man in the fucking business.  You're loved.  I'm loved because I'm nice.  You're loved like Mr. Magoo is loved.  Now you're...  That's when you know, 
[01:55:30]  whenever a black comedian goes back to the cartoons,  they're really going to start trashing you.  There is no these stupid cartoons.  By the way, Keith had the best description of Robert Kelly the other day,  which I have to remind myself before I forget.  Because now Bob goes around and tries to make the young comics like him  and they fucking fear him.  And he said, yeah.  Keith goes, he's like Casper the Friendly Ghost.  All he wants to do is be loved and everybody just runs away from him.  I told these fucking guys fucking years ago. 
[01:56:00]  I said to Bobby, there's two people in the world.  Motherfucker.  There's guys who try to be the Hulk,  but they're really Bill Bixby.  And there's guys that's trying to be Bill Bixby,  but they're really the Hulk.  And that's Bobby.  Bobby is trying to keep from being the Hulk all the time.  And you can just see he's got them eyes where it's like,  don't make me angry.  The clothes are getting a little tighter.  He wants to go full Hulk. 
[01:56:30]  And there's some guys that run around trying to be scary.  Maybe he's just not eating dessert.  I don't know.  Something's going on there.  But Bob is, yeah, he does it.  Bob's an edgy dude, man.  Jaws.  Remember when I said those black doll eyes?  The sharks have.  Lifeless eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  Bobby certainly has those eyes.  But Bob tries to,  but the other side of Bob is he tries to be like the guy,  you know, he goes to the young comics and he's like,  dude,  and they're sitting at the table like this,  you know,  terrorized.  And he's like, dude,  let's hang out.  And he just wants to be like the guy that they all like, 
[01:57:00]  Hey,  Bob's here.  And they're not.  Yeah.  Oh,  really?  And now he's up in Canada.  Casper friendly goes.  I think the world is going in a better place for all of us now.  Yeah.  Yep.  I think Colin is kind of like the Zeus of New York.  He's the front man.  I'm the canary in comedy.  He is.  He's like people kind of,  Colin is,  he's not old,  but he's like,  he's like the fucking,  he's the dude.  The patriarch. 
[01:57:30]  That everybody kind of looks up to.  The patriarch of the comedy side.  He's one of the older guys in your,  your group.  Is that what you're trying to say?  No,  not in age wise,  just in,  just in,  in,  in a lot of older fucking guys that nobody pays a fucking attention to.  leave voice out of this.  And wisdom.  And wisdom.  Well,  leave voice out of that too.  Wisdom.  Jesus.  Wisdom twice.  In all those things.  Not,  not just age.  He's behind my ears.  I think Nick is Colin's age.  He's younger than Nick.  He's younger than Nick. 
[01:58:00]  But,  but,  but it's good.  It'll be good to see.  It's good to see him.  I,  I can't wait to see what the show has become.  Cause I saw it downtown and now I want to see it on Broadway.  This,  this,  this show of yours,  Colin.  What about our next thing?  When we revisit tough crowd in a new format.  Oh shit.  Look at you.  You should start working on that now.  Oh shit.  You should bring that fucking thing back.  The world needs tough crowd.  Would you put it on oxygen now?  I understand that,  but you got Jerry.  Maybe you could talk Jerry.  Is this what we're going to put on oxygen now?  Put the show on fucking lifetime. 
[01:58:30]  On the fucking Oprah's new channel.  Everybody else is just fucking sitting around.  Not one new.  Just,  we used to be like five dudes that didn't give a fucking design.  It was five dudes that just need a job.  And we're just like,  how edgy can we,  we're doing a practice show at two in the afternoon.  No shit.  Just to see what fucking,  it just took the air out of me.  Yeah.  That's a crime.  That fucking show went away.  But it was,  but it's always 10 years ahead.  It's always 10 years ahead.  Ridiculous.  10 years ahead.  Hey,  um,  why did I get an invite to the fucking thing? 
[01:59:00]  Like a,  like a first day.  I want to fucking go and you wanted to do a little red carpet action.  Didn't you?  Once again,  that wasn't up to you.  I would think I would want an invite to things,  even though I had never reached out to anybody.  I would do this.  I'm saying I would do the same thing,  which is where's my fucking invite.  Even though you probably like me when people would invite me that shit,  I wouldn't go.  That's the other thing.  Here's the biggest.  Here's what makes me sick right now about this fucking magnanimous douche. 
[01:59:30]  You're supposed to invite people.  All of us.  Because you feel like an asshole if you call a call and go,  can I?  Somehow he's learned.  Can I be at your big fucking debut?  He just learned yesterday.  Two weeks,  maybe.  Just yesterday.  He went to a media class and I was like,  what the fuck is that about?  You can't invite yourself to anything.  You look like an asshole.  Listen to me.  Don't act like I just learned this shit from media training.  I've been through therapy.  Media training.  I've been through a lot of fucking bullshit pain that I don't deserve.  You think Joan Rivers had to call and get an invite?  Oh,  shit.  Or did Joan Rivers get invited? 
[02:00:00]  That's a good fucking point, O.  How do you invite yourself?  No,  I said it earlier.  My point was you can't invite yourself to things.  This is not about you.  This is about these guys.  They didn't get the invite.  We're all pissed off.  I wasn't pissed.  Jimmy fucking invited himself because he was there.  Because Jim knows how to work it.  Yeah,  yeah,  Jim didn't invite himself,  by the way.  Jim knows how to work it.  Well,  you can blame my assistant.  I just assumed you didn't have my new number.  Blame my assistant,  Claire.  That's what I figured. 
[02:00:30]  Blame your assistant.  She just knows the lingo and everything.  Well,  you guys should have been invited,  but Patrice,  let's be honest,  Patrice is the kind of guy,  you know,  first of all,  he had this 4th of July barbecue every year.  I'm not invited to that either,  Patrice.  So neither am I.  I've never got the invite.  Here's his lame ass excuse.  Can I just say,  oh,  I figured,  I knew you wouldn't come,  but it's like,  that's his excuse to me too.  He goes,  I didn't invite you because I didn't think you would go.  How do you know that?  Unless you fucking asked me once.  I fucking love Anthony. 
[02:01:00]  You're not Anthony,  but you,  but Anthony will go,  no,  I'm not coming.  Yeah,  that's true.  Now,  you won't go that.  You don't do that.  I would have went.  To your barbecue,  I would have absolutely went.  He would have gone.  Some things that blow off,  absolutely.  Ever since three years ago,  when we had this discussion with Colin,  I invited him to everything I do.  And guess what he's been to?  Nothing.  Twice on 4th of July.  It's been three.  I have three things a year.  So he's been invited to nine things since then.  They're all on the days when white people are with their family. 
[02:01:30]  Do you hear?  I invite him for Thanksgiving.  What?  Why would he rather eat fucking boiled cabbage?  And bread pudding on his bad Irish fucking cooking family.  All right.  Come on over,  man.  Give me one invite.  If I'm not there,  then don't invite me again.  That's how I work.  Whoa.  I do.  Give me one shot.  Give me one shot.  I invite you for Thanksgiving.  You're not going to come for Thanksgiving.  Well,  that's a family day.  Well,  that's some people don't. 
[02:02:00]  Some people don't have family.  Some people.  So you can't be insulted.  Some communities don't believe in the nuclear family.  You better watch it,  Colin.  You're fucking in.  Be careful.  You're on the radar now.  Right.  You can't say stuff like that.  Well,  it's Colin Quinn.  Hi,  I'd like to apologize for a statement I made on a radio program.  Some radio show.  Black people don't come to Broadway.  Black people don't come to Broadway shows.  Yeah,  he's safe. 
[02:02:30]  He's safe.  They only go to the Scouts Bar.  They only go when Denzel's there.  And then they sit there eating goddamn Mickey D's in the middle of the show.  Holy shit.  It's true.  Black people don't go to Broadway shows, right?  The McRib is limited.  Come on.  It's limited time.  You know what it is?  Can we all be honest and just say we want to be invited to things?  Of course we would.  Without intentions of being allowed.  We don't want to be invited to things.  We just want to be invited.  We're kind of hurt, Colin.  We want to be there.  How the hell are you going to bring us all together all of a sudden in this conversation?  We want to be there, though, right, Patrice?  I would have liked to have been asked.  We're proud of Colin.  But you didn't come all summer. 
[02:03:00]  Opie's the only one that actually deserves to be invited.  He came.  You didn't come all summer.  I live out on Long Island.  I went to the show when there was one guy.  Two exits from Queens.  I remember when this show was one guy that intro'd you and then had to run to the back  to start the light show.  That's right.  That's how far back I go with this show.  And now it's on Broadway with a big set and a director.  Not only that, but I started this at the brokerage in Governors.  You could have came there.  I will say Opie's very supportive of a few of the guys that come through. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, great.  He's got to walk out of his house 20 yards and he's anywhere.  It doesn't matter.  Even when he lived at home.  Oh, fucking you guys.  Huntington.  I would come in for shows, man.  Fucking Keith will drive you anywhere you need to go, man.  You can just hop in the truck.  Don't beat me up.  I'm a busy man.  I did it when I was on Long Island as well, man.  I don't like the fact that you're making everybody inclusive in your shitty bad behavior.  I went to media training.  I'm trying to help you.  I love that he went to media training.  I'm trying to school you.  Do you understand?  Do you understand? 
[02:04:00]  I'm trying to school you.  I desperately don't want to be this no more.  I know.  Now, but I'm looking at Colin, right?  And I'm saying I desperately don't want to be this and acting that way are two different things.  But you just learned how to not be an animal yesterday.  You've been the wolf man for fucking 40 years.  Now it's fucking, it's a crescent moon.  He's a regular human being now.  Are we going to acknowledge he lost weight too?  He's on some kind of like Broadway diet or anything?  He lost weight two years ago.  Fucking Hollywood sin.  You're a Hollywood sin now, man.  You know what he is?  Don't say the Broadway diet. 
[02:04:30]  That's something else.  Yeah, that's true.  Opie, you know what he is now?  Lean.  Yeah, you're lean and you're wearing the right colors.  You used to be skinny and sick.  Now you lean.  He's not in his pajamas.  Look at the colors he's wearing.  His hair is growing back.  Someone told him to wear those colors.  Yeah.  How did your hair start growing back?  My hair's not growing back.  It's all thick.  If you have less head because you lost weight, it looks like you have more hair.  Maybe that's what it is.  He's sitting with his eyes closed.  Just, I've had it.  A little bit of crow's feet collagen. 
[02:05:00]  I see it.  I fucking, there's one less toe on a crow's feet.  Larry King didn't give him this shit.  Are you botoxing?  No.  Have you done the Today Show, things like that?  No.  No?  You did invite me to do that, but Jerry did take care of that.  He mentioned the show when he goes on.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't invite me on those shows.  They will soon, though.  I'm not like a morning guy.  They will.  You are.  No, I don't believe that.  I've done it.  I did it for a while.  You're back.  No, you're back.  I did it for Tough Crowd.  When I did Tough Crowd, here's how stupid I was.  When I was doing Tough Crowd, they put me on those rounds, and I could just see, 
[02:05:30]  you know when people don't like you, they're like, but they're just, their face frowning,  but you can barely see the dimple.  I used to see that all the time during Tough Crowd.  Not on this run.  Wow, really?  No, you're beloved now.  Not on this run.  You're like George Bush with his book.  Everyone loves him now.  Somehow this guy's George Foreman now.  What the fuck?  Everyone loves him now with this book.  And he's like, no, Katrina, I love black people.  Yeah.  And fucking Kanye West is apologizing to him. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  I'm sorry, sir.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  How did that happen?  People adore Bush now because he put this book out.  He's being honest.  He's a fun guy.  They've noticed when you sit down and interview him, he's a genuine fun guy.  I raised my hand.  He got me.  I wasn't a Bush fan, but man, this book tour has turned me around.  He's likable now.  Fuck.  I hate to say it.  Maybe because of the media training he went through.  Maybe he went to media training.  Now all of a sudden I'm like, I'm finding myself liking this Bush guy.  You know, Patrice, it's funny.  You know, when I'm doing Long Story Short at the Helen Hayes Theater, 
[02:06:30]  tell a charge.  Now and forever.  Through January 11th.  11 weeks.  I hope you have to do it for 20 straight years.  It's going to be a run.  I hope it runs like the Fantastics.  I mean, I hope the show, you know, from your lips to God's ears, Anthony.  So six, so nine shows a week?  Not, no, eight.  Three on Saturday and six, seven, eight.  Three on Saturday.  You have to do three on Saturday?  Two, five, and eight on Saturday.  And that's why you got to be in shape, right?  It takes, you got to be.  I've been in shape for two years. 
[02:07:00]  But you got to be in top condition, though.  Give me some advice.  Can you mentor once in your life?  So do you have to be fucking in shape for this?  Last time I mentioned, you guys dragged me down.  Did you remember your great speech on Tough Crowd?  Right at the end when we found out it was canceled, Patrice just had me crying.  He gave this speech.  Everybody's like talking about the show.  And he goes, see, Colin did this show to kind of lift us all up.  But whatever he said about it, we just dragged him down to all levels.  We destroyed him.  You're not a good friend, Patrice. 
[02:07:30]  That was hilarious.  Because he was fucking calling.  He needed that.  He fought for bums.  He needed that.  He fought for pure bums.  Bums.  Thinking he could pull everyone up, but everybody just dragged him down.  This was one of the funniest speeches.  Oh, that is perfect.  Now a lot of them are on YouTube.  But I wish I could see someone.  That is perfect.  Patrice would give these speeches.  If anybody asks me anything about my career, they'll go, I go, Tough Crowd, man.  That was it.  That was as close as it gets to doing what you want to.  This radio show is like as close as it gets to you just doing something. 
[02:08:00]  Just doing your shit.  Saying something.  Without having to worry.  Just talking shit.  Wait, let's get back to this.  Eight shows a week.  That's what I'm saying.  Holy shit.  What can I say, fellas?  I'm like, you know.  It's an hour and a half?  I'm like Christian Chenoweth.  Hour and a half?  What?  He knows all the Broadway stars.  I do.  I know.  He doesn't.  She lives in my building, actually.  That's a woman.  Ann Chenoweth is like her daughter.  Stop.  She's a tiny little pipsqueak.  Nothing to do with that.  Pipsqueak.  He only knows when Fantasia was in The Color Purple.  She's a big Broadway star. 
[02:08:30]  I told you.  Is it an hour?  How long is the show?  Hour 15.  Hour 15.  Short and sweet.  Bam.  Yeah, you're in, you're out.  You do that at the cellar.  Fuck that.  That's a long story short.  But it ain't too bad.  The three shows on fucking Saturdays.  That's brutal.  And it's a 2 p.m.  2, 5, and 8.  So you can cut, we'll invite you to the 2, you'll be late for the 5, and then you'll  sleep at the 8.  You know what, too? 
[02:09:00]  Can I, in defense of comics, and he knows this, comedians, like, when we do shit, like,  it's Colin.  So it's like, hey, Colin, when you're finishing the Broadway thing, you're coming down to the  cellar.  Like, that's how, it's like, we don't go, oh, we're going to support each other, kind  of thing.  It's like, oh, Colin's over here.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't think of it like, you know, I mean, I think maybe I'm talking just in our little  fucked up circle.  No, I understand what you mean.  You're talking just in your little circle.  You're talking about yourself.  But look at, like, Norton.  Norton, me and Norton are great friends.  We don't talk ever. 
[02:09:30]  No.  We, I never talk to Norton.  And when I do, it's like, yeah, one of us has got to go.  But, like, I love him as a dear friend, but it's like, I don't ever, I don't talk.  You always got to go somewhere, right?  Yeah, we don't talk.  Yeah.  None of us talk.  I don't talk to fucking Nick.  No.  Keith, we don't talk.  But we're all, like, buddies.  Isn't that an odd thing?  Yeah, yeah.  To defend each other and everything, but you don't talk.  When these mics are off, there's nothing worth talking about.  No.  It is, I guess.  Not really.  But that's what I'm saying about his show. 
[02:10:00]  It's like, it's not even, to me, it's like, I should be like, fucking Colin's on Broadway.  It's like, you go, oh, Colin got a show, man.  I heard it's good, man.  It really is a good show.  I'll see you.  I'll talk to you tomorrow or something.  That's how you feel.  Are you going to go, Patrice?  That's how you feel.  Yeah, I got to go.  Because it's big.  It is big.  Tell a church.  Let me just explain something before this fool distorts the entire thing.  Every one of the rest of these assholes shows up at the show, calls up and goes,  hey, I want to get to the show.  They talk to my assistant.  And it's only him, but he's going, well, you know, the way we are, you need more than 
[02:10:30]  media training.  You need serious psychological help like I got.  You need therapy because your distorted view, oh, everybody's like me.  No, they're not.  No one's like you, Patrice.  What was your big issue?  He goes like this.  Colin, what was your big issue that you needed?  I did so many five like this.  Some kind of therapy.  What was your issue?  What did you have to get over?  No issue in particular?  No?  First of all, if there was, I wouldn't even talk about it.  Well, I was just asking.  Just a general makeover.  We all got our crosses to bear, as they say.  Wow, you're getting angry. 
[02:11:00]  You're getting angry, Colin?  I can't be, I can't be, I know what it is, and it bothers me bad.  Because you know what it is that you can't fix it?  It's, it's, it drags me down.  I cannot be nice when I don't like you.  Like, I can't.  Fake nice.  I can't be fake nice.  I tried telling you, but I can't.  It's painful.  But wait a minute.  Do you see how he says it?  Like, it's a big revelation.  Everybody knows this about you.  They don't know that.  It's not a secret. 
[02:11:30]  They don't know.  You can't be real nice.  You can't be real nice.  They just think I'm an asshole.  Fake nice, real nice.  You just can't be nice.  It's like the girl in the morning, it's like the girl in the morning that goes, good morning.  And it's five in the morning or whatever.  And it's like, good morning.  And, and, and you go, are you serious?  Like, this is, this is oppressive to me.  Like, to make me do something likable right now at this moment.  Good morning.  Like, you got to answer back.  Like, it's nice.  But it's what he has to do now that I'm like, I'm watching Colin for my lead. 
[02:12:00]  To see how fucking Colin gets to it.  You're not going to do it.  If Colin can do it, I can fucking do it.  I don't like that I've become, in the past half hour, you guys have characterized me  as like the new Ben Vereen.  Just smiling my way to fucking success going, yes, sir.  You're smiling, you're, you're smiling more.  I'll do it my fucking way.  I always have and I always will.  You're now the litmus test for some scumbag that made it.  What is this?  Exactly.  But, but he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a trooper.  No, not a sellout or just a, he's a trooper who deserves it. 
[02:12:30]  You deserve it.  Oh, I don't deny that at all.  I deserve more than what I got.  Here's what he's, he's now got a balance curmudgeon and grateful old asshole.  He's got to figure out a way that people think is cute.  Not either of those are really good, by the way.  I know.  Did you notice that?  It's like a fucking bat in my fucking ribs.  That really hurts.  He knows it's true, though.  Yeah, he has to fucking, it's a balance now. 
[02:13:00]  He has to fucking, I'm trying, I'm trying to balance.  A curmudgeon and graceful old asshole.  Yeah.  With people that you don't like go to try to kiss you and you don't pull back to go, I  don't, why are you kissing me?  I don't, why would you do that?  But I was never like that.  But now you got to kiss, you know, you got to kiss now.  How do you think I ran tough cry?  I was the front man that actually schmoozed everybody.  I fucking, but look at you, you.  You, I was the guy that had to deal with everybody, the networks, all that stuff.  I was always fine like that.  That's what I'm saying.  But you're a fucking animal.  You bit, you bit heads off over there.  That was the problem is I fucking around with people. 
[02:13:30]  There you go.  Did he?  Just a few of the wrong people.  He fucking chomped each head.  Good for him, man.  But that, good for him, but not good for him.  That's what I'm saying.  It's, it's.  Yeah, but he didn't want to water down what he believed in.  But Colin, did you learn from that now to realize, oh, okay, I could, I could.  Well, to a degree I did, to a degree I didn't, I can't do, I can't, I can't obviously, when  it comes down to belief, if I'm doing something like this.  What would you do different on, on, on Tough Crowd?  On Tough Crowd?  Back then, though.  Go back then.  What would you do different?  Not the new Tough Crowd, the old Tough Crowd.  What would you do different? 
[02:14:00]  I would say, Patrice, may I please interject?  Oh, fuck.  I want to hug Colin.  I want to hug Colin.  Just towards the show.  So, I'd say, Mr. O'Neill, may I please have the floor?  Fucking fuck.  I loved it.  I mean, Tough Crowd, one thing about Tough Crowd I have to say, there's a few little changes,  of course, I would make with the way I dealt with, you know, some of the people in power,  but ultimately, I have to say, I don't have regrets about the fucking guys that were doing 
[02:14:30]  it.  No, it was great.  It was, it was, it was everything they claimed they want.  It was groundbreaking.  Guys like just, you know, they were just being so distinctive and unique.  So, I mean, you know, that I don't really regret.  I can't regret it.  Yeah, then they lie and then realize they didn't want that.  And they realize they didn't want that.  Yeah, but like you said, now they're starting to get used to that kind of attitude.  They didn't want you doing that.  But they'll never, they'll never see the likes of these motherfuckers again.  No, no.  Because the difference is, I'm going to tell you, for real, it was, it was really made  up of a bunch of guys who thought that this was, that we were outside the business. 
[02:15:00]  Like, like everybody.  Like, for real.  I guess you proved yourselves wrong.  But that's what it was.  None of these motherfuckers worked the days since that show ended.  Oh, you know how many fucking enemies, I got enemies that I didn't know I had from  Tough Crowd, man.  Yeah, you did.  Really?  Oh, fucking, I can name them, I can name them.  I know why is that?  Why is that?  All of them, Kathleen Madigan, Dom Herrera, fucking Bobby Slayton. 
[02:15:30]  Why?  Because this fucking, this show pulled skirts up.  Yeah, but because you were voicing your opinions on certain things that people get mad?  You know why?  What the fuck is that?  You know why?  It's because that show.  I like the way he said it, like it was Katzenberg and fucking, yeah, no kid.  I made enemies, so like, oh, yeah.  But I'm talking about, I'm talking about, I'm talking about comics, fellow comics.  I don't even know who the fuck on top, like fucking, you know. 
[02:16:00]  That's what, that's the part we'll never know.  Why are you worried that those guys don't like you?  No, but he's saying something else.  I'm not worried you.  He's saying something else.  He's not worried.  But he's saying something else.  We'll never know who on top.  Like, I don't know who didn't, but I know the comics that didn't, but because the show  But he's saying the people that we don't know.  There's guys that, what the show did was show the difference between dudes who, funny guys  and comedians.  Let me tell you something.  And that comedians aren't funny guys.  And some comics aren't funny. 
[02:16:30]  What comedians don't realize is the audience doesn't fucking really notice that.  Within your guys' whole circle, they'll sit there and be like, oh, fuck.  I'm not funny.  I'm not coming off as funny.  I'm a comic.  I could go on stage and do my act, but I can't sit here and bullshit and be funny.  So now they look at you like, motherfucker, this guy's taking this opportunity to make  me look bad.  And they thought it made him look bad, but it was just us being funny.  But the audience just sits there going like, oh, that's funny.  But some motherfuckers flourished on that show.  Fucking Greg Proops, Pat Cooper, fucking, you know, those popped to mind, but it was a 
[02:17:00]  million motherfuckers who came on and they knew how to bullshit.  Hey, man, it's similar with our show.  We've got a lot of guys that are supposedly very, very funny and they have bombed horribly  on this show because they can't just hang.  Their act is funny.  And then they're mad at us that we didn't help them get into their bits.  It's like, that's not how this fucking works, man.  Turn on the mic and say something, you know, of interest. 
[02:17:30]  So it just don't.  Very similar, man.  You don't know what that.  We said some terrible shit, but it was funny.  Absolutely funny.  It's too bad.  Absolutely fucking funny.  It's not about that.  It's about comedy.  Well, long story short.  How would you like?  Telecharge.  Telecharge.  How about, across from Al Pacino.  How would you like to have a show?  You're a host of a show like me.  And in the middle of the show, you're saying something you think is kind of deep and funny.  And suddenly you hear, shut up.  That's right.  But you know, one good thing about Patrice, I give him credit. 
[02:18:00]  When he says shut up, 99% of the time you're like, yeah, that was true.  I'm really starting to go off.  I'm pontificating here.  I'm so fucking happy for Colin, man.  Of course.  We all are.  Stop being happy for me.  It's only the beginning.  This show is just one thing.  Good.  At the Hellenaries.  Stop with the fucking shit for the stars.  I'm going to show everybody's attitude for the stars.  Just enjoy fucking Broadway, asshole.  No.  I can't.  And he says this is the beginning, so maybe we'll be invited to the next thing that he does. 
[02:18:30]  It'll be on HBO.  They'll film it.  This is an HBO show, Colin.  And they're probably working on it.  I'm sure they're working on it.  This is for HBO all the way.  You know that.  Sneaky best.  That's, once again, just the scintilla of what I'm trying to do here.  He has got plans and ideas now.  I got plans and ideas I've been working on for years.  All those papers are going to get done.  If I have to burn this fucking country down, I'll do it.  Maybe we'll be invited to the HBO taping.  That would be nice.  I'm sorry, Opie.  You're right.  You should have been invited. 
[02:19:00]  You, I don't feel guilty about it.  You shouldn't.  You were supposed to come this summer.  Yeah.  You never went to this.  I'll just watch it when it's bootlegged.  You never went.  I support.  Bootleg.  I support.  Someone will videotape it.  You can't support.  You're understand, Anthony's got this whole subculture, like Long Island fucking dirtbag  subculture life.  He's got a whole pipe.  He's got pipelines and shit you guys don't even understand.  How come you don't get no pressure to be a friend?  I don't know.  How the fuck do you get away with not being a friend?  I'm very honest about who I am and what I am. 
[02:19:30]  My family knows.  I talk to my family once every two months, and they're like, you know, you should really  drop by more often.  You don't think you should fucking go see Colin?  I absolutely want to, and I should.  He came with Toby Carolinas and sat next to my Aunt Margaret.  She took zero for the whole show.  Yeah.  I love seeing Colin, but you know what?  The whole thing, I think, I think I think too far in advance.  It's like, all right, I got to do this.  I got to get my car.  I got to drive.  I got to probably have a couple of drinks.  Now I got to risk driving back drunk, or I can take the train.  So I got to take a cab and do this. 
[02:20:00]  Do you understand that everything's a pain in the ass for me?  Underneath the wild lifestyle of this radio guy is a Long Island dolt.  It's like, I got to drive.  The Southern State, you see, it's a mess.  Oh, God.  I knew I should have taken the parkway.  Here's Syracuse's finest.  Actually, Sam's in here to set up the next section for you, Colin, because this is going  to be your last appearance on our show.  We want you to go out with a bang.  Oh, wow.  You know what that is?  This is it for Colin.  This is it for Colin. 
[02:20:30]  That's it.  We've noticed, Colin.  This is his last drop-by.  This is his last.  This is like, you'll never see me again.  He actually already doesn't want to, but he's throwing us a bone.  This is his first schedule, last drop-by.  This is a mixture.  You notice how he hasn't said it's not?  By the way.  It's true.  He's shaking his head like, ugh.  But he hasn't said it's not.  Just tired.  Sam, what is happening after the break?  What about Scorch?  For Colin Quinn.  Well, after the break, it's been requested for a long time, and I thought I would wait 
[02:21:00]  for Mr. Quinn to come and bring it back to the show.  It's PFG TV.  Pretty fucking great.  Pretty fucking great TV, which is Scorch's public access show.  Public access?  What is it?  This is a show that not only is it in New Hampshire, but I mean, according to Scorch,  it's in cities across this country and others.  Oh, according to Scorch.  Yeah.  So where is it, really?  New Hampshire, right?  Well, it would just be, yeah.  It's pretty much New Hampshire.  All around the whole country, Scorch, Scorch, Kingdom of Nakedness. 
[02:21:30]  So after the break, we do that?  Can Colin stay with us after the break?  Of course.  Does he got to take off?  Let's look at his people.  Does he have to go anywhere?  And why is she writing the whole time in the corner?  That's Adrian.  I told you, she's writing a book about comedy for years.  Oh.  So she's writing about stuff right now?  Yes.  A book about comedy for years?  I think she's taking notes.  Anthony, she talks.  She's taking notes.  But Tracy, she talks.  You guys are crazy.  No, she's taking notes, and then they're going to have a meeting after the show, all the  things he did right and wrong during this appearance. 
[02:22:00]  If you want to talk to the public, at least we'll talk to you.  At least come in.  That's the publicist.  Is this the publicist?  I knew it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Say, if she says, no, I don't want to come in.  Just find out where he's scheduled.  I would love to know.  Yeah, we should just find out where.  Hi.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  I want to start.  What has he done right as far as his appearance goes?  And what has he done wrong?  And be honest.  Everything right.  Huh?  Everything right.  Everything right.  Everything right.  Anything wrong? 
[02:22:30]  She would never say that in public.  She's going to drag him out there and point in his face.  In the corner, after I told you not to share any more moments like that, don't tell him  you went to therapy.  People don't want to hear that you're crazy.  And she's going to strongly suggest that he doesn't do appearances like this one anymore.  Just bring up the show bar.  Never.  He loves you guys.  He's done everything right.  Long story short.  Thank you.  And who helps him with his clothes now?  Tell the charge.  Yeah, that's not his clothes.  Who took him shopping?  Yeah.  Who cleaned him up?  I don't know.  What's your schedule today? 
[02:23:00]  What's the next four things today?  He's hanging with you guys.  Well, we're only till 10, so what does he do afterwards?  We should be doing big shows now.  I've got to do the marriage ref today.  Oh, you're doing the marriage ref.  Fucking Seinfeld Mafia.  I want in.  I want in.  I want in.  Let me tell you something.  I want in the Seinfeld Mafia, motherfucker.  There's no way you'll get in the Seinfeld Mafia.  No way.  Oh, because they got George Wallace.  Dude, I'm going to fucking...  That's not why.  Dude, you fucking nailed it.  I want in. 
[02:23:30]  Juan De Niro couldn't be a made man in Goodfellas.  Same reason.  Well, I can be a friend of Collins.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a good fellow.  So fucking, fucking, I'm a friend of yours.  Can you imagine he would bring the marriage ref down with one of his opinions on marriage  and women?  He would destroy the entire show.  Holy, holy.  Doesn't know how to keep it within the lines.  They'd actually go back to the friggin' 60s and you'd just see, boop, a test pattern.  The show is no longer on the air.  Stay tuned for a rerun of I Love Lucy.  I can't disagree with that, Patrice. 
[02:24:00]  I can't disagree with that one, man.  You would destroy the marriage ref.  Fuck the marriage ref.  Would you bring up the donkey punch of the fucking pirate?  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Do we have to go back to the John Gibson appearance?  I want in the Seinfeld Mafia.  Excuse me.  Did I just hear you say, fuck the marriage ref?  No.  I mean, when I say fuck the marriage ref.  The publicist wants you out of here.  She's looking at her BlackBerry.  She's very nervous.  No.  Not fuck the marriage ref.  She's very nervous.  It's an interesting way to get into Seinfeld Mafia but going, fuck the marriage ref. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, wait, let me reiterate.  Fuck being on, like, that's not how I want to get into stuff in the mafia.  Oh, okay, that's stupid.  See, this is your problem right here.  You can't say fuck the marriage ref.  You want to get on through the respect from the other people in that group.  Yes.  I want to have an opportunity to join the Seinfeld Mafia.  That would be a great place to be.  There's so few in there.  I like the way he said it. 
[02:25:00]  He said, I didn't say fuck the marriage ref.  I said, fuck being on.  That cleans it up.  Oh, God damn, man.  Holy shit.  Who else is in it?  I'm trying to think.  It's Papa, Colin, who else is in it?  Larry.  Larry is a fucking, he's a family of his own.  He's a Don.  He's a split off into two families.  Really?  They're like Bananos and, what's his name?  Wanda's in the Larry David family. 
[02:25:30]  Wanda's in the Larry David camp.  So why not Keith Robertson?  No, Keith is in the Wanda.  Keith is in the Wanda.  Keith is a friend of Wanda's, but he's not a friend of ours.  He's a friend of Wanda's.  He's a Capo, and he's a soldier.  Yes, we gotta put up a chart.  Yeah, we gotta put up a Mafia fucking chart.  I would love to see that.  I would love to see that.  And the branches are called Colin.  Colin's a Capo.  Big time Capo.  Yeah, yeah, big time Capo.  I'm gonna tell you how much Colin...  And then you and Jimmy and shit are under Colin. 
[02:26:00]  Can I tell you what Colin is in the...  Because he's been part of the fucking Seinfeld Mafia  since the first tough crowd show on NBC.  That's right.  And Seinfeld would have to call him in and go,  Look, Colin, you know, Colin, if this was gangster shit,  he shoots people right away.  Yeah.  Seinfeld has something close to his heart, but he shoots you.  He comes in, and he's trying to fucking give you a little bit of...  What do you call it?  You know, interrogation.  Yeah, yeah, a little interrogation.  And Colin just goes, Fuck this!  And shoots him. 
[02:26:30]  He goes, You can't do that.  You can't just do that.  Now Colin is becoming the leader.  You gotta have a sit-down.  Right.  And then it's Papa's concierge.  No trouble from Pops.  You need a black thug.  Yeah, Papa would never say, Fuck the marriage ref.  No.  I didn't say, Fuck the marriage ref.  He said, Fuck being on the marriage ref.  Because you're saying, Yo, fuck the marriage ref.  I'm saying, I have other useful uses than the marriage ref.  You know who's on with me today? 
[02:27:00]  Who?  So, Lauren Graham and Mary J. Blige.  And Mary J. Blige don't actually...  She's having...  Well, I read that.  But that's in Black Trades.  Oh, look at him keeping the fucking...  Look, you learned right there.  He just took the bridge and threw some water on the match.  He said, I ain't burning this bridge.  Hey, Chris Rock's in the Seinfeld market, right?  He absolutely is.  Yeah, we got another one in there.  But Chris Rock, I think he fashions himself as a Don.  As a Don, but he's black.  He's under there.  He's got his own family.  Yeah, but it's a black family, though.  Yeah.  But he still has to... 
[02:27:30]  He's like Nicky Barnes.  He has to go through the Mafia.  He's fucking...  Wow.  He's Stacks from Goodfellas.  Falling asleep when he should be getting the truck fucking...  He's not Stacks!  Chris Rock ain't Stacks!  From fucking Goodfellas, man!  He's Stacks.  He's Stacks.  You'll be late for your own fucking funeral.  Cramer's gonna go over his house and shoot him.  He's definitely not Stacks!  Don't you hear it with one of your bitches?  He's definitely not Stacks!  But Chris Rock has a family of his own, but he has to go through... 
[02:28:00]  What about the Sandler family?  Yeah, the Sandler family.  Oh, shit.  We don't talk about it.  Yeah, that's got fucking all the old SNL guys.  Which has a Judd Apatow family, which comes through and...  Yeah, the different ones.  Oh, man.  But I would say Seinfeld has to be at the top of the family.  Seinfeld's a big Seinfeld Mafia.  It's very hard to get into.  And he's also the Don G of New York, so that's more like...  And the fact that that motherfucking zillionaire walks around...  It's a good way to get in, too, by the way.  Dude.  With no...  With... 
[02:28:30]  Just by himself.  You just...  You got to respect that, man.  Let's just spread the word that that goes on a little more on radio.  That he's just walking around alone.  But I'm saying...  It's not a...  It's just a fucking guy be...  Jesus!  Al Qaeda's out there.  He comes...  What's up?  Blow up an institution.  Just see him.  Just like Joe Pesci.  Joe Pesci.  He's...  You'll see that fuck...  You'll just be like...  Yeah.  Is this Joe Pesci?  Joe Pesci.  What the fuck's he doing?  Like, buying a hot dog right here?  And he...  And he's very New York.  I just got a tweet from Colin's publicist.  Oh, shit.  The Twitter account, CQ on Broadway.  Oh, what happened? 
[02:29:00]  What is it saying?  It just says, I am Colin Quinn, is now on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, wow.  Good thing we know that.  Did you just do that?  Who's running CQ on Broadway?  It's automated.  They just punch his whole year's schedule in, and a computer pumps the plugs out.  I am Colin Quinn, is now on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  You got people working it as you're on the show.  Well, I hope people are listening in to the show, and I certainly hope they buy tickets  to the hot new Broadway show.  I strongly suggest you see the show. 
[02:29:30]  All kidding.  I mean, the show's a real gut buster.  A humdinger.  It's hilarious.  It really is hilarious, man.  Would you say an hour and a half, hour 15, are we coming to see education?  We're coming to see comedy?  We're coming to see all of it encompassed?  It's a thinking man's comedy.  Shut up.  I don't want to know.  I don't like you now taking turn as the interviewer trying to show me your fucking radio skills.  Let's take a break.  I like what you said.  That wasn't fucking nice. 
[02:30:00]  That's not nice, Colin.  I'm fucking...  Let's take a break.  We got Scorch Audio next, just for Colin Quinn, the big Broadway star.  You're going to love this shit after the break.  Follow the O.P. and Anthony Show on Twitter.  O.P.  Twitter.com slash O.P. Radio.  Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And little Jimmy Norton.  Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  Ooh, look at that Twitter plug.  I like Twitter plugs.  Yeah, why not?  I don't think it really does anything, but it's kind of cool.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  You get all these followers, and then you get like maybe half a percent of the people  actually reading your shit.  Is that what happens?  Ah, yeah.  And it happens to everybody.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No doubt in my mind.  I don't tweet that often.  I only tweet when I'm sitting back, drinking a few beers.  So you're tweeting all the time, then?  Well, yeah.  Exactly.  What was that tweet you did last night about McHale's Navy was on to celebrate Veterans  Day?  I was like, yeah.  I said, because it was ridiculous.  And I think it was HBO comedy to give them, because HBO does play like a lot of those 
[02:31:00]  cool World War II things and shit like that.  But HBO comedy doesn't have to get in on the Veterans Day thing by playing 1997's McHale's  Navy with fucking Tom Arnold.  Tom Arnold?  I was like, yeah, there you go, veterans.  I remember that.  Thanks for your service.  Here's a big pile of shit.  What the fuck?  Every channel doesn't have to get involved.  Like, it's Veterans Day.  Let's play fucking Sergeant Bilko.  That's what programmers are supposed to do. 
[02:31:30]  Is that it?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  So to look at all the holidays and go, you know what would be great?  This and people go, perfect.  Good.  Media trading?  Yeah.  You learned that in media trading.  I never liked when they played a Christmas episode in the summer, like on a sitcom.  I don't like the fact that every fucking show has Christmas episodes for all Christmas.  It's so annoying.  Who cares?  It's annoying.  I like that.  Yeah.  People would share.  The great show was Seinfeld.  Yeah.  That was a great show.  People are sharing their stories about that cruise ship.  Oh, are they?  Just a horrific scene, man.  It's a bunch of old people. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, my goodness.  Nothing happened.  That's the problem.  But the news is all over it.  They're sharing their stories.  They did not have the chocolate buffet at midnight.  I don't know if I would go on the same line, but that's another story.  She's a trooper.  She's a trooper.  Well, that's the bottom line here, right?  She's a trooper clearly having a good time.  And I don't think anyone's going to hold it against her.  We're joking.  Maybe that could be a negative campaign ad.  When she runs, she organizes.  Oh, shut up.  Maybe we could do a tough crowd cruise ship tour.  Ah, that would be great.  You guys would kill each other. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  Hey, PFG TV.  Let's get into this.  Sam.  Yeah.  Get a mic and let's roll with this shit.  This is for Colin Quinn.  I am Colin Quinn on Twitter, by the way.  We're talking about Twitter.  That's right.  Well, you can get him a few ways now with the show.  That's true.  That's true.  Yeah.  Tell the show.  He's a beaten man already.  Hell in hell.  Only took an hour.  Long story short.  Colin Quinn. 
[02:33:00]  Sam.  Yeah.  Scorch is back, huh?  That's right.  We never went away.  We just go away because we can't take too much attention.  Too much.  Too much.  Too much.  Right.  Yeah.  Scorch is like LSD.  You just don't want to do it all the time.  No.  But every once in a while, it's fun.  It's nice to revisit.  Yeah.  Sure.  You should go into a different world.  Yeah.  The show's like pot.  You can do it every day.  It's fun.  So for the new listeners, just summarize.  What is this Scorch character all about?  Well, Scorch is a man who taught me everything I know about radio.  Yeah.  He was Syracuse's finest rock DJ. 
[02:33:30]  I got hooked up with an internship after interning here and going back up to Syracuse.  You did.  You were a traitor.  You left here just to go up to Syracuse.  Yeah.  Scorch stole me away.  For Scorch.  Well, we knew Scorch before you, and unfortunately for him, he was pizza and we were hamburger.  Right.  And that's the programming director.  He said, both are great, but the station's more heading towards hamburgers than pizza.  And your pizza.  Because pizza's great.  A lot of times I want pizza.  I got an update on that program director, by the way, about a year ago.  Dead.  He's a greeter at a supermarket. 
[02:34:00]  No way.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's how bad his life got.  Using his communication skills.  Yeah, that's how bad his life got.  Yeah, it's good.  Good for him.  He greets people at a big-time grocery store in the Boston area.  The guy that cut the placenta falls to the floor line out of lightning crashes because  I think his wife called him.  Oh, fuck.  I forgot about that.  You remember that?  We used to get ragged on all the time.  He was editing songs before anyone else started doing it.  Editing songs.  There's a line, the placenta falls to the floor in lightning crashes.  Right.  I forgot about that one.  Our program director, and I'm convinced, in my opinion, that his wife was so overbearing. 
[02:34:30]  She fucking hated us.  She just hated the station, hated the rock music, hated that offended her, that he cut  it out of the song.  So the song started on the second verse.  And we would get mocked for it because people would be like, BCN doesn't do it.  You guys are faggots.  And we'd have to sit there and go, yes, we're faggots.  Sorry.  Well, that is very offensive, the placenta falling.  Yeah, placenta falling to the floor is just, it conjures up an image, Colin.  Well, then don't fucking play the song. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Then just don't play the fucking thing.  Uh, PFG TV's back.  Right.  So Scorch, uh, after tearing it up in Syracuse, uh, decided to go to New Hampshire and leave  his co-host behind without mentioning to him until the day before.  Scorch is the best because the entire time I was there.  Fending for yourself, Scorch.  I was with him for nine months.  Not only was he fending for himself, but he was telling his co-host, Pauly, don't worry  about it.  I'm sending out tapes of us.  They're going to pick us up somewhere.  Don't worry about it.  He was telling him, do not send your tapes out because I'm sending out tapes of both 
[02:35:30]  of us while he already knew that in two months he was going to New Hampshire without Pauly.  He didn't want him sending his tapes out so Pauly didn't get another gig?  Yeah.  And there was no reason for it.  I love watching Colin as we talk about Scorch.  It's my favorite thing in the world.  You learn a lot from Scorch.  Colin can't get enough of Scorch.  You do.  And while Scorch told me that he would technically be making around the same amount of money,  which since Scorch lies constantly, is obviously less money. 
[02:36:00]  with the bar gigs added on to his salary, he'd be making six figures with bar gigs.  Plus, it was that classic relationship of like the older kind of pompous guy who thinks  he's schooling this young kid.  He doesn't see the contempt.  I know.  The sarcasm that's dripping off of this kid.  He's like, kid, you want to learn from me.  So words of wisdom.  He's just noticing everything the whole time.  Oh, yeah, Scorch.  Wow, what a great bit of info you just gave me. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, you take that with you, kid.  Writing Scorch's emails that were from listeners.  No, go get me a cup of coffee.  Pushing him around.  Oh, yeah.  Stamming his friend in the back, but he doesn't think he knows.  It's called paying your dues.  Paying your dues, kid.  I did it.  Oh, really?  I had to write like five or six emails every night.  Oh.  He'd tell me to, all of them shouldn't be from Syracuse because some of them, because they  could listen to streaming.  So make sure, you know, they're from New York.  New York City.  They're not listening. 
[02:37:00]  He knows.  All right, well.  Well, let's.  It leads us to his big cable access show.  Right.  He moved to New Hampshire.  He doesn't look at it as a cable access show.  No, it's on the My9 or whatever the equivalent is, the My Network.  But he pays during the paid programming portion.  Right.  It's Saturday late night.  And right before the show starts, it says the following show has been paid for.  Yeah.  The views expressed are not those of My Network television.  They don't even say not necessarily.  No, they're not. 
[02:37:30]  It was.  Actually, they put absolutely not.  Right.  The opinion of this station.  Right.  We didn't even want to accept his money, but we're very poor.  But Scorch talks like, My Network came and saw his public access show and says, we need  this for our network.  I got picked up for another season.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I was able to finagle a few bucks.  He's a part of the Seinfeld mafia soon.  And he spends half the show.  Yeah, sure he is.  He spends half the show just asking for sponsors.  Yeah.  Which is just trying to get people to give him money that he doesn't share with his staff. 
[02:38:00]  He's going to fucking do a commercial for maple syrup up there.  Up in the fucking boonies.  He has done it.  Yes.  Maple syrup.  He's got stuff for it.  Well, let's get right into the audio.  Let's hear some of Scorch's wonderful TV show.  Scorch starts the show by fist pumping Nick and making hilarious fisting jokes.  He says nothing about pause for the cause, then goes back to fisting jokes.  Fist me.  Fist me, Nick.  Fist me.  Oh, I love fisting you.  Why do I always miss?  And then fisting.  Oh, you know it's going to be a fine day when you can't even fist your best friend. 
[02:38:30]  Or you miss fisting.  I miss fist my best friend.  That's not a good thing.  Welcome, everybody.  Scorch's BFG TV.  He's the best.  Welcome, everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah, Scorch's BFG TV.  And he treats it like it's a real deal, like late night.  Like it's Letterman or something.  Yeah, yeah.  He has no clue that no one gives a shit about him or his show.  He actually did once on the show say, uh, I don't, he talked about something he saw 
[02:39:00]  on Leno, but he wouldn't mention Leno's name because he said he didn't want to bring up  the competition's name.  The competition.  He actually said that.  He sits at a card table.  He sits at a folding card table.  It's fucking, it's like the little rascals putting on a show.  It is.  It's horrible.  It's slightly worse.  Pay as you exit.  That's right.  Spank.  Come here, everybody.  Scorch's BFG TV.  Get up, yeah.  Get dumped.  Oh, my God. 
[02:39:30]  What in the...  I love the smattering of applause.  How many people are at this taping?  They're, I mean, they can only fit, like...  Is this the Chinese place still, or did he get kicked out of there?  No, now he's in a local access TV studio.  But, I mean, you could fit 15 people maybe in there.  All right.  I'm telling you, this is the most popular show in Manch Vegas.  Manch Vegas?  That's what they call it.  That's a good Manch.  Remember last time?  Right.  Manch Vegas.  Right.  Patrice is done.  Patrice is just nodded off at Scorch.  You need orange juice? 
[02:40:00]  You're good.  No, this ain't.  This ain't, though.  It's just Scorch.  Sorry.  What an interesting thing, you know, for anybody wondering.  Last week, we didn't air because I was in my little cage for the pause for the car.  So, we're going to talk about that.  I am just now starting to recover.  Is that the event where we had one of our listeners throw paint on him?  Throw paint on him.  You know that one, right, Colin?  Which one?  Was it paint or mustard?  It was paint.  Where he sits in a dog cage. 
[02:40:30]  For the whole weekend or whatever?  To raise money for dogs.  Cause for pause.  Cause for pause.  And he gets in the cage, the doggy cage, and people come by, see him in the doggy cage,  and give him money for the cause.  But something, yeah.  Does it go to the cause?  Hey, who knows?  Maybe there should be an accounting.  It's going to...  So, we thought it would be a good idea if our listeners threw paint on him.  So, yeah, the listener, because he couldn't get out of the cage.  That's when he threw paint on him.  That's when he stopped calling the show.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  That pretty much ended our relationship.  I'll never forget when I was trying to get him to come back on the air, and he goes,  Yeah, Sammy, this is not cool.  Somebody just came up and threw yellow paint on me.  Scorch, I don't know what's happening.  Some of our listeners get overzealous.  Yeah, yeah.  We never told them to do that.  I know, Sammy.  I know.  The guys love me.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  It's great.  Yeah, he has no clue.  He thinks we just absolutely love him.  Which I guess is kind of true.  Gonna play douche addressing.  Yeah, I love the guy, but, you know.  What does he say?  We share ideas?  Yeah, when I first was interviewing with him, outside of a Bennigan's, he said that you guys 
[02:41:30]  share ideas, sometimes he'll do stuff from your show, whereas the same way you guys have  done stuff from his show, Feels for Meals, and things like that.  Oh, so he took credit for Feels for Meals.  How is he taking credit for that?  That was his idea.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know, Feels for Meals, do better dressing.  They do rhyme.  Feels for Meals rhymes, and Scorch loves to rhyme.  Scorch is a big rhymer.  He's now starting to recover.  I was crunched up like some... 
[02:42:00]  When you're a human being, living in a cold...  No, he couldn't think of anything that's crunched up.  He gets crunched up.  He couldn't think of something that...  I was crunched up like a...  Like a crunched up thing.  That's Chip Chipperson.  It's not really a natural thing to do, you know, but we're going to talk about that soon.  Hey, look, why is it...  Mark, can you get a close-up of my blood?  Why is it every time that I fist you, I get bloody?  Because we're tight.  Yes! 
[02:42:30]  Someone likes that.  Because my fist is tight.  There you go.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  His fist is tight.  But the fist isn't tight.  The anus would have to be tight.  No, no, no.  The fist would have to be big.  And you'd have to...  I don't know.  I don't even want to figure it out.  I'm exhausted.  The fist and tight is a good one.  I'm exhausted even thinking about this.  Let's go right into the next clip.  He's very excited about what's coming up on PFG TV.  Oh.  Furious, who was my cage...  He wasn't my cage mate, I shouldn't say.  Was he a cage master?  He was my kennel mate throughout that week. 
[02:43:00]  You did a good job again, though, man.  Thank you much.  You know?  And so we're going to talk about how much I raised soon.  Because it was one of the best ones yet.  But a couple of good things going on with this show that I want to get into quickly.  For instance, we're growing by leaps and bounds.  We have more cities.  Join in the Scorch's PFG TV network.  Come on.  Not only more cities, but more states.  For instance, we are working on Florida.  And we are working on Texas.  And we are working on Atlanta and Georgia. 
[02:43:30]  Atlanta's still in Georgia, right?  Yes, it is.  And some of the areas in Northern California as well.  So we've got a lot of things going on.  He's working on...  I know.  Please, because my ex lives there and she might think I'm making money.  Now, is that your first or your second?  Okay.  That would be my first one.  Now, everybody on the staff can vouch that this show does not pay a dime.  Which is why we're always looking for sponsors, which we'll talk about.  Oh, God.  Scorch, man.  Holy shit.  Well, did you hear that?  I mean, you guys make fun of him, but he's working on Atlanta.  Working on. 
[02:44:00]  Florida.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Scorch is the type of guy that says things like, I'm working on this to cover up for  the fact that he's completely lying because you can't prove or disprove.  Yeah, you can't prove or disprove working on.  You've got to love his enthusiasm, though.  He thinks he's...  Yeah, yeah.  He won't give up.  No, he won't.  He thinks he's a media mogul.  I was so freaked out when he kept telling me that he was having conversations with people  at XM, that he was going to be joining you guys at XM.  Yeah, yeah.  He once broke down that he was talking to Kevin Straley, who was in charge then. 
[02:44:30]  Wow, back in the old days.  Yeah.  And that he had a conversation with him that they had talked about growing up in the same  town, and he had all these details about a conversation that I'm sure never happened.  Oh, never took place?  He talked to me about it for a half hour, and it never happened.  That's very strange.  It's weird.  Yeah.  Wow.  Talks to invisible people.  It's weird.  Ugh.  I love the scorch.  Wow, look at that.  The schedule's getting to you, Carl. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, that schedule's getting to you.  You used to be able to trot in here in the morning and full of piss and vinegar, as they  say.  Why the hell are you busting my balls?  Patrice's been asleep for a half hour.  He was.  Patrice just woke up.  Well, he's sleepy.  You all right, Patrice?  Yeah, he was here.  All right, we're done with scorch, let's face it.  Exactly.  Patrice has fallen asleep.  We're done with scorch.  What about the weird news, though?  You like weird news?  One more clip, Carl.  Yeah, one more weird news.  It's true.  One more clip.  Let's start off with a segment that we like to call Weird News. 
[02:45:30]  Scorch bleeding out the fist from fisting.  Oh, no, that's not it.  You ever heard the phrase, go fly a kite, right?  How many times has somebody ever said you go fly a kite?  Deep Hole Bay, Oregon, 45-year-old Dennis Brokis just took that right to heart.  He was flying kites with his roommate.  What kind of a 45-year-old guy flies kites with his roommate?  Yeah, you're the kind that wears pajama bottoms to Walmart.  There you go.  His kite got away from him. 
[02:46:00]  That's good stuff.  It would appear that the guy, Dennis, tried to get his kite, but all he caught was air.  He chased the kite right off of a cliff, and he fell to the ocean below, and he broke his  body into 100 pieces.  Ironically, the kite was fine right next to his body, about 100 yards from shore.  Dennis' body, as you can see, all broken up.  The kite was in perfect shape, so don't worry about it, because the kite was fine.  Another one.  That's where the laughing goes. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, the laughter was supposed to be there in that humorous segment.  The kite was fine.  The kite was fine.  The kite was fine.  All right.  We lost Colin.  We lost the truth.  I think Scorch might be done.  No, he can't be done.  I mean, he wanted to debut a new segment for you guys and everything.  Really?  What?  Taking It to the Streets, which is T-I-T-T-S. 
[02:47:00]  He likes acronyms, too.  That's right.  He likes rhyming and acronyms.  Yep.  Taking It to the Streets is actually a pretty genius segment.  We could skip to that.  Yeah.  I guess that would be...  That's fair.  Let me guess.  He talks to people on the street.  No, that would take effort.  But you don't understand the cleverness of Scorch.  He almost spelled out tits.  That's why taking it...  Yeah.  See?  T-I-T-T-S.  Gotcha.  Oh.  Taking It to the Streets is pictures of street signs... 
[02:47:30]  Colin's looking for his publicist to yank him out of here.  ...that have funny names.  Oh.  Patricia, you all right?  What the fuck happened?  Scorch.  Was it Scorch?  Scorch happened.  Scorch is debilitating.  It really is.  Is that what happened to you?  A chore.  Really?  Scorch just blew me.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody gets jealous that they don't have the chops that Scorch does.  Scorch is like Ambien.  You know what?  Is that what it is?  Just walk around.  You didn't know you were up.  So we should play Last Man Standing. 
[02:48:00]  In Rock T-I-T-S.  It's like, yeah.  You want to play Last Man Standing with Scorch?  Yes.  Let's see who leaves.  See who actually is awake by the end of...  I'll make it.  I love it.  Show tonight, Colin?  Yeah.  He has to go sleep.  Let Colin go.  I'm not going nowhere.  You're just going to watch me sleep?  Fuck.  Let's see if Colin leaves, then we're going to never let it down.  What time's your show?  Eight.  Eight?  Are you talking about the MR or my show?  I'm talking your show. 
[02:48:30]  Because I got the MR first.  What's an MR?  Marriage Ref.  Right, right.  Marriage Ref.  When's that coming on?  FTMR.  That's his motto.  Patrice is going to get his tattoo.  FTMR.  Fuck.  Fuck the Marriage Ref.  Marriage Ref is coming on in March.  I'm shooting it today.  Oh, wow.  That's a long time.  That is a long time.  You know, a lot of people think TV is actually live, but actually, sometimes they tape months  in advance.  Do you believe that?  That's ridiculous, though, March.  How many episodes? 
[02:49:00]  I don't know.  Ask the Godfather.  Can I get on it?  You?  I told you, no way you'd be on that show.  Oh, man.  I'll behave.  So you can't even plug your Broadway show on that show?  No.  See?  Now.  Silly.  Fucking March.  January.  Although, you'll probably still be on, believe me.  It'll probably still be there, but.  I don't know about that.  Six months.  Six months.  That's a long time on Broadway.  A lot of new shows coming up. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, what?  Revival?  South Park.  What?  They're doing a musical about the Book of Mormon.  Is it going to be more anything?  It's got to be something new, African, where they're playing some unusual instrument.  Like Fela?  I told you, why don't you go see the Scottsboro Boys?  No.  There's a musical on right now called the Scottsboro Boys.  Why did you accuse me of raping this white girl? 
[02:50:00]  Please don't hang me.  But he didn't do it, Joe.  But he's a nigga.  I've been falsely accused.  Falsely accused.  Holy shit.  Hey, boy, where are you from?  Mississippi, sir. 
[02:50:30]  What are you doing here?  My musicals suck.  I'm fucking going to be a Scottsboro Boys.  Musical.  Oh, that's great.  A fucking Scottsboro Boys.  I would see that.  That's fantastic.  Of course you would.  You would fucking...  You wouldn't even get up through an intermission.  Just based on your performance alone.  That's fantastic. 
[02:51:00]  Some kind of weird Broadway rope as they're fucking...  That was great.  He's Broadway bound.  Oh, my God.  I'd see that.  Broadway lynching.  What the fuck?  We got a stage hand up that says, okay, pull the rope off when the guy's back.  And just, like, a whole bunch of doll feet will come down where all you can see is the feet.  Just the feet.  Just the feet.  You know what happened?  Sparkles.  Somber music as you clutch your playbill.  What about the dramatic lighting?  One spotlight, maybe, you go with her? 
[02:51:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  No, no?  Fucking different colors.  Different colors?  Somebody in the back.  I think it was raining the night.  They hung them.  So somebody back with aluminum foil.  Fake rain and thunder and lightning.  Yeah.  Hitting trash bags.  Some red color gels with a fan on it to look like the cabin's on fire.  Oh, no, that's the blood.  Red ribbons in the fan.  That's the blood.  Fucking Scottsboro Boys.  Oh, I'm there.  Can you imagine?  Scottsboro Boys. 
[02:52:00]  Scottsboro Boys, the musical.  Yeah, the musical.  Singing and dancing.  Some guy's playing something.  I'm sure they're going to be doing something.  Music.  I tell you one thing.  I'm grateful for people that come out.  Even like you do a show and no one's there hardly.  Like I fucking do some shitty show in Albany.  And I'm going, I'm so happy somebody came out.  Yeah.  Because I do live.  I went to Avenue Q.  Yeah.  When it was big.  I couldn't. 
[02:52:30]  Me and my girlfriend back when we was really gross.  I was just fucking.  She pulled the panties off in the bathroom.  This is Avenue Q.  She just sits on my hand for the fucking.  Holy shit.  Just finger popping at the whole show.  That's fantastic.  And she just finger popping.  And she just, every time I sing, she's, she's acting like she's dancing.  She's dancing and riding.  She's getting off on your head.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Oh, wait a minute.  She's sitting on your lap during the show. 
[02:53:00]  No, no, no.  I had my hand on the seat there.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  My girl wants to come.  She, my girl loves Colin with all, she's going to fuck Colin if he, if he'd have her.  Really?  Yeah.  Who wouldn't have her?  She's gorgeous.  Yeah.  She wants to, she loves some Colin Quinn.  He says something so pimpish during Bobby's birthday party.  He says, he goes, you know, you're so pretty.  I just want to, I just want to kiss your eyelids.  Oh.  And she fucking got horny off of that.  She still brings that up.  Wow.  Kiss my eyelids. 
[02:53:30]  Why don't you have Colin kiss your fucking eyelids?  Only a thin white lips would say, I'll kiss your eyelid.  It's hard not to feel erotic at Bobby's birthday party.  It brings out a lot of emotions in everybody.  And he massaged her three years ago.  She never forgot.  Wow.  Really?  He did some.  You know how to massage a girl there, Colin?  No, he did some fucking hybrid thumb thing that he was doing.  He didn't give her a foot massage, did he?  Throw that motherfucker off on three flights of stairs, you get that motherfucking foot. 
[02:54:00]  Rocky Horror.  Rocky Horror.  Tony Rockahari.  Why, what's this about foot massage?  Fucking Pulp Fiction, man.  Pulp Fiction shit.  They got a name for your Broadway show.  I, uh, oof.  You see that one, eh?  No, I don't have that.  I only have the phones.  You see the, uh, yeah.  There's got to be something.  Something terrible.  I can't read it from you.  It's Le Negra Balls.  Le Negra Balls?  Yeah.  Like Le Misrame.  Le Misrame.  Yeah, I didn't like that. 
[02:54:30]  No, it doesn't work.  It sucks.  It's, uh, fuck out.  Yeah, that's just, uh, that's acky.  That was just raw.  Yeah, fuck out.  Yeah.  What happened?  You need orange juice?  No.  It's fine.  I'm good.  We're trying to get started back up.  It's fucking disgusting.  He just sang a whole beautiful musical.  It was very nice.  That was great.  It was haunting.  The Scottsboro Boys woke me up.  It was.  It was like acapella.  It was kind of, like, really deep.  Yeah, yeah.  It's had dynamic to it.  It's strong.  What is it?  We got material. 
[02:55:00]  We got Bobo's anti-bullying PSA, but we have other things, too.  Bobo gets bullied a lot here on this program.  You know what?  This is a quickie.  Yes, he does.  Yeah.  In fact, last time we were here, it was really kind of disturbing.  Remember?  Hey, do you remember?  No, I don't remember.  Bobo was fucking brutalized.  It was just, it was kind of ugly.  It's bullying.  It left kind of a weird feeling.  It's bullying.  It really is bullying.  What did we do to him that day?  It's not show business.  It's bullying.  What did we do to him?  Um, I forget.  I forgot what it is, but.  Well, this is, uh. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, I knew he had a new.  He just had a new fucking Mets hat, right?  Oh, no.  What was it?  Oh, yeah.  And it was.  That was before?  Destroyed.  She's been here a few times already.  Something went on his head.  Ice cream hat?  Oh, the ice cream cake, and then we made it when we shoved his.  Ice cream cake.  Yeah, I think it was ice cream cake.  Ice cream cake on his Mets hat, but that was two times ago.  Then last time, it was something with the girls.  Cherry darts.  Cherry darts.  Right, yeah.  We threw, uh, the girls threw cherries into his ass.  Into his asshole.  Trying to get it directly into his asshole, as it were. 
[02:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, now what's he up to?  Well, he doesn't like being bullied, so he's got a little PSA.  Because it's all the rage to be a celebrity and to put one of these out there.  He's in the It Gets Better campaign.  Yeah, he is.  And he wants the kids out there to know that there was a time when he was picked on.  A time?  Yeah, but it gets better.  Oh.  Like, they can be Bobo.  Yeah, see?  It gets better.  They can overcome this.  Yeah, just like he did.  Yeah, like Bobo has.  He doesn't get picked on anymore.  Now he's the cool kid.  Oh, he doesn't.  Why don't we listen to this? 
[02:56:30]  With his fake Twitter girlfriend.  Here we go.  Hey.  Yeah.  Hi, I'm Radio's Daniel Bobo Carlin.  You know me from the Opie and Anthony show, Linger Longer.  I'm here to talk about bullying.  When I was in school, I was picked on, teased, spat upon, tormented, beaded, raped, belligered,  very much disliked, and made to feel less than.  But take it from me, it gets better.  Since high school, I've become an international radio star. 
[02:57:00]  I've met my heroes.  I've exposed my horribly disfigured genitalia with some of the greatest comics in the world.  I've been called stupid by millions of people in the United States and Canada.  I've made out with a homeless man.  And my three-inch erection has been on display for better-looking women than I ever thought I meet.  I get phone calls from radio producers at 4 a.m. on a daily basis. 
[02:57:30]  And I've had sexual relations with my brother.  I don't get paid for any of this.  I still live at home with my mother.  I will probably die a virgin.  And my dog's name is Mr. Moon again.  Hang in there.  Take it from Bobo.  Obviously, it gets better.  See what I mean?  And that was all him, too.  Nobody wrote that for him.  Get the fuck.  Mr. Moon...  Someone...  Mr. Maloon again.  Mr. Maloon again.  Someone needs credit for the writing.  No, I don't know what you're talking about.  It was all Bobo.  That's some good fucking writing right there, man. 
[02:58:00]  Wow.  It was all Bobo.  That's some good writing.  I forgot his dog's name.  Mr. Maloon again.  And did his sister name it?  I think so, yes.  Yeah.  I like that name.  Mr. Maloon again is a great name for a dog for every time.  Apparently, though, he can't read the word bludgeoned.  He thinks it's belliger.  Belliger.  Yeah, yeah.  I bid belligerent.  Not to say that that was written for him.  But belligerent is also a good way of describing things in the world.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Is he here?  He is.  Do you want to...  Just for a second.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Please, for a second.  Just for a second.  Because I want to hear about... 
[02:58:30]  He's got this girl on Twitter.  And I'm a little leery.  I don't think it's a girl.  I think it's a guy fan fucking with him.  Here comes Bobo.  And he's so in...  Oh, here he is.  Hi, Bobo.  Hi, Colin.  Congratulations on your Broadway show.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, what's the name of it?  A Long Shorty Story.  A Long Shorty Story.  Yes.  You want to try that again? 
[02:59:00]  No, it was a long story short.  I was a little bit out of breath from running down that hallway.  I know.  It was about a breath.  And what theater is it?  I don't know what theater it is.  Helen Hayes.  And where can you get tickets?  I think a telecharge.  Yeah.  Very good, Bobo.  That means you did your job today, Colin.  Nice, Bobo.  Yep.  Because if Bobo knows, anyone can know now.  Bobo, I want to ask you about your girlfriend on Twitter.  What's her Twitter name?  She's got two... 
[02:59:30]  Supposedly got two Twitter accounts.  Supposedly.  You've even got him being cynical about it now.  Yeah, I know.  She's got two Twitter accounts.  All right, what's the one she uses to talk to her little schnookums, you?  Well, she goes...  For some reason, she made this Twitter account called I Heart Bobo.  I Heart Bobo.  Right.  It's at I Heart Bobo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I don't know how to pronounce the other Twitter account she uses.  I don't know how to pronounce what it said, the wording on it.  Intelligent?  But I just know, supposedly, it says her name, though, is Ali. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah?  Yeah, no last names, bro.  Ali-xander?  I don't know what her name is.  See, I'm thinking it's a guy fucking with you.  I think this girl really likes Bobo.  Bobo, I'm with you.  I think you found true love.  I've been trying to get her to call in the show.  Yeah?  Yeah, I see your tweets.  They're very desperate.  You talk about, you're constantly like, every one of your posts are like, I Heart Bobo, 
[03:00:30]  are you there?  Are you here?  As opposed to what, though?  Something smooth?  Yeah, you're right, Patrice.  Would you like some Merlot, bitch?  No.  She takes forever to respond.  I don't know.  And I've tried to say, could you direct message me?  Because I can't, for some reason, I...  Why wouldn't she direct message you?  Because I want her to direct message me.  This way, I could direct message her, my number.  Well, she should do that.  Now, how did you...  How were you able...  If you don't have her phone number, how were you able to send a cock picture? 
[03:01:00]  Which you did send her a cock picture.  You sent her a cock picture?  No.  No, that was a female friend of mine that asked.  That requested that.  How do you know it was a female?  It's a female I talk to on the phone sometimes.  Oh, who is this?  Oh, no.  It's a female friend named Sharon.  Sharon.  So, this girl, Sharon?  Really?  And you sent her a picture of your cock?  Yeah.  Why?  It looks like popcorn.  She requested a cock pic.  Popcorn.  She requested it? 
[03:01:30]  Looks like...  Yeah.  You're like Brett Favre.  Like a whole shiitake mushroom?  Why would she request a cock pic?  I don't know why she requested a cock pic.  And why don't you go after the girl that requests the cock pic and not the girl that doesn't even...  I tried, but it seems...  She seems to be picky and only want a novelty size.  Wait.  That I don't even think exists.  What?  A big dick?  Yeah, but I think... 
[03:02:00]  So why'd she want a picture of yours?  Small.  I like that phrase, novelty size.  It gives me an idea why the heck she...  What is a novelty size?  Like a novelty store cock.  I think it's bigger than what actually exists.  Alright, what would that be?  How big in inches would you say that is?  Yeah, what doesn't exist?  What I think doesn't exist is something like over a foot long.  And she wants over a foot long.  It exists.  Yeah.  There are some guys that got that, Bobo. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  They're very...  What I call...  Gifted individuals.  Yeah, you're special too.  Or what I call lucky stiffs.  Ah, stiff!  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  So you, uh...  Oh, how about bonafide?  Ah!  That's a good one, Patrice.  Oh, shit.  Now, are you...  When was the last time you talked to I Heart Bobo? 
[03:03:00]  I talked to her...  I think it was on Wednesday.  And what did she, he say?  I don't know what this person...  What she said.  She didn't respond.  I guess maybe she wasn't online at the time.  I thought you said you talked to her.  I was trying to...  Yeah, through tweets.  When was the last time you got a response, I'm saying?  I think it was a week ago.  Because I decided to go five days without tweeting.  Why?  Whoa.  I don't know why.  I just decided...  Mystery.  Yeah, keep the intrigue going.  See if she misses a mission. 
[03:03:30]  To play coy.  He's being smooth.  It's something all the big celebrities do.  They decide not to tweet for a week or so.  Go Twitter dark for a little while.  Yeah.  Here's a couple of Bobo's tweets.  I Heart Bobo.  Will be glad she went to NYC when she sees me.  And then here's one.  I Heart Bobo.  Call in tomorrow.  Let ONA know how you are.  And then I Heart Bobo.  Good to hear from you.  I think it would be neat to call in together. 
[03:04:00]  And what are her responses to this?  Bobo.  I don't know.  She said that she...  I think that one she said she was at work or something at the time.  That day.  Is her hat at name there?  It's right there.  At I Heart B-O-B-O.  Yeah.  Can you go to her tweets?  What's her tweets?  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we go to her tweets?  Full investigation.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's see this.  Because Bobo, we're just looking out for your best interest.  You know.  First one.  Leave me alone.  Please God.  Who are your pals? 
[03:04:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  I went to the police already.  Wait a minute, Bobo.  I'm going to call into question.  I think you better scrutinize when people say, who are your pals?  These gentlemen are certainly the farthest thing for pals you can find on this planet.  Fucking Broadway cons.  If anyone's saying, who are your pals, they're never your pals.  That's a rule of thumb.  That's what the fucking mafia used to say.  They'd say that to store owners right after they fucking took their money. 
[03:05:00]  Who knocked the knee cap out?  There's I Heart Bobo's tweets.  That's what you're looking at.  That's it.  This is I Heart Bobo's tweets.  It says, every breath I take, I think of you, my dear, sweet love, Radio Bobo 202.  Oh, my God.  So that's what she's writing to Bobo.  Nice.  And when was this tweeted?  When was that tweeted, Dan?  How long ago?  22 hours ago.  22 hours ago.  What do you think in there, Bobo?  I think that's nice.  Okay, now, if she does show up in New York, what will you do if she wants to meet you? 
[03:05:30]  What's the night?  What's the night going to look like?  I would call her at, actually, first of all, before she would even head to her hotel, I  would pick her up at the, I would meet her at the airport.  Bicycle?  In what?  In what?  You don't drive.  Well, I'd still take the bus out there.  You would pick her up on a bus?  You'd pick her up on a bus?  Yeah, but here's the thing.  I would help carry her luggage to her hotel room.  Oh, so you'd be like a, do you know they have people that do that at hotels?  Yeah, but I would have to carry her luggage from the airport to the hotel room. 
[03:06:00]  This is amazing to hear made-up, retarded romance.  Hey, I think it's only...  If you fucking choose the flowers, comes with the...  Hey, I think it's only appropriate you help, if you've got a chick from out of town, it's  only appropriate you help her carry the luggage from wherever, from the airport to her hotel.  I just look over my shoulder, I go, hurry up, bitch.  That's how I fucking roll. 
[03:06:30]  See, Bubba?  He didn't like that.  No, he didn't.  He's a hopeless romantic, and I emphasize hopeless.  Hey, Bubba, hold on.  So, you pick her up on a bus.  So, now the bus bus...  It kneels, the kneeling bus.  You get out.  You go and get her.  At what, the baggage carousel?  This is so a fucking guy.  Exactly.  And then you grab the bags, and you carry them out to the bus stop in front of the place.  I don't know that.  No bitch says my love. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  And then you wait for another bus.  My dear.  From that bus, I guess it depends on how far the hotel is.  I miss you as much as the hotel's in Manhattan.  My dear, sweet radio, at Radio Bubba.  All right.  Let's say the hotel's in Manhattan.  Where is she getting in?  Kennedy?  Where are you, sweetie?  It could be either Kennedy or Newark, because supposedly she's in Canada, and both Kennedy and  Newark are international airports that take overseas flights.  Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada? 
[03:07:30]  Jesus Christ.  I have no idea.  So what, uh, what, uh...  My love?  She lands.  You take her to Manhattan in a bus?  Bobo, she lights you for what?  It was from the bus to the train, I guess, to wherever it is in Manhattan.  Bobo, how did she, she just out of nowhere just started, like, what's the first tweet she  ever sent you?  I don't know.  She wanted to talk to me on Twitter about, I was just asking me questions about the show. 
[03:08:00]  About Jimmy Norton.  Oh, but wait a minute.  I am not a guy to, uh, people that are...  Yeah, yeah, the haters, uh, all things.  Bobo knows I'm all woman.  Right.  Because you've talked to her.  Exactly.  You've talked to her on the phone.  Has she sent you pictures?  I've never talked to her on the phone.  I've talked to her on Twitter.  I guess she doesn't...  But she hits his face.  It's called bewilderment right now.  And that's proof enough that she's a woman.  She said she was.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, uh, I'm still, I'm fascinated by this. 
[03:08:30]  So you get, you get the bus.  Now she's in a hotel in Manhattan.  So now you got to take the bus to a train station?  I was fascinated by this, except that so far it's taken longer than an actual fucking visit.  Yes!  We're still on the fucking bus.  We're still on the, not even at the hotel.  She's taken this long-ass flight.  She's taken a long-ass flight into New York, and now you're putting her on a bus and a train.  Halloween, though.  Well, maybe I would buy her a cab.  Oh.  That's a big maybe.  But, listen, a medallion. 
[03:09:00]  Halloween.  I'm just saying, saying there's another option.  Anthony, Halloween, she says, I want him as badly as he wants me.  It's now going on close to three weeks later.  Yeah, yeah.  When is this going to fucking happen?  Yeah, when's it happening?  How's she getting down here, by the way?  You footing the bill for a plane?  I don't know.  She just says she's planning on taking a trip to New York.  When?  She says sometime around the spring, supposedly. 
[03:09:30]  Spring?  You gotta wait till spring?  She says possibly earlier, as soon as she has the money to travel.  What does she do for a living?  You guys are gross.  Leave my Bobo alone.  You are making me cry.  Oh.  What does she do for a living?  See that?  That I don't know yet.  How do you not know?  Why didn't you ask her?  It sounds like a Nora Ephron movie.  You will see when I go to New York and let Bobo take my womanhood.  This is October 30th.  This is like a goddamn romantic comedy. 
[03:10:00]  It really is.  It's called 22 Hours.  The last Twitter was 22 hours ago.  Mindless in Seattle.  The retard diaries.  I'm not sure how to word stuff on Twitter because of the character limit.  Oh, because of the character limit?  Yeah.  I don't think you should trust this girl.  It sounds like something fishy is going on. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It really does.  Something rotten in the state of Newfoundland.  That's why I asked her to call in.  That other movie, You've Got Chlamydia?  I don't think she's got a match.  Yeah, almost.  Bobo, are you suspicious that this might not be a woman?  I am partially suspicious.  Oh, boy.  Good.  Would you be worried about disease?  Would you go raw, Bobo?  He means no condom.  No condom.  Bare back, yeah.  What do you think? 
[03:11:00]  Would you?  Should he pull down his pants to answer this question?  Oh, God, no.  Yeah.  Oh, God, no.  I can tell you I wouldn't go raw for anal.  What?  Why?  Boy, he jumped a couple of steps.  We're not even on the bus yet, and he's talking about anal.  Not going raw. 
[03:11:30]  It was a question he was asked.  It was a question that was being asked.  Bobo really stepped up his game here.  Yeah, we're not even up to dinner yet, Bobo.  Slow down a little bit.  Slow down.  What I would do is I would have a pizza delivered to a hotel.  This is like a Nora Ephron comedy, I'm telling you.  It really is, yeah.  I'm going to write a rom-com.  A nice pizza from the pizza place by where I live.  Now, why would you do that?  Don't you know hotels have room service, and you can make some kind of romantic thing? 
[03:12:00]  This is so cruel.  Just write it off on her bill.  Yeah, it is.  This is so cruel.  This person is committed.  This piece of shit is so committed to this fucking nonsense.  It's cruel.  It really is.  You're talking about I heart Bubba.  I swear.  Hey, sweetie, I've missed you.  It's just, Bubba's going to end up killing somebody over this shit.  It's true.  It could be.  This ain't cool.  Wait a minute.  I will, honey.  You wouldn't understand because you're mean.  And anybody that says, go fuck yourself, you piece of shit, stop being a meanie. 
[03:12:30]  Meanie.  Don't you talk to my BF that way.  Are you feeling that this is your girlfriend kind of long distance relationship?  He's loving her.  He's loving her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But the thing is, I think it would be more if she were to call me.  Right.  To call you.  Hey, bitch, call motherfucking Bubba.  Why did you?  Call him up.  Don't even trust if she calls.  You didn't call me.  You didn't call me, Tony.  And then he jumps off the Verrazano. 
[03:13:00]  Tyree Miller.  Hey, hey.  Come on.  I'm bored with it, all right?  The location.  Her location is in Bubba's heart and soul.  I don't know why on this Twitter account she puts that.  Yeah.  But on the other one, she says, I don't remember what town it is.  Canada.  What town in Canada?  I don't remember what it said.  Do you remember what province?  Oh, I really threw him there. 
[03:13:30]  Is it like Toronto?  Is it a city like Toronto?  I don't remember the name of it.  Or is it a province like...  She's not giving much info, Bobo.  She's playing with your heart.  Do you ever remember those songs?  Like 98 Degrees and those bands?  Exactly, man.  Stopped playing with my heart.  All for one.  All those guys.  What are you doing?  Those songs that I used to smash the radio when I'd hear them.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  A little anger.  Well, because at the time, I got tired of hearing boy band songs at every freaking station. 
[03:14:00]  You're right.  Bobo, I got to know.  You're at the hotel.  Now, you take the baggage into the hotel for her, right?  Exactly.  And now, what do you do?  What's the move after that?  Do you say, all right, I'll be back?  Do you hang out in the hotel?  What's the move?  The move is go to Dwayne Reed and buy some stockings and strangle her with her as soon as she...  Some pantyhose.  This ass fucker, dead body.  Kill this poor tweeting bitch. 
[03:14:30]  Well, first, I guess maybe she would go...  I guess she would probably go and maybe probably change some laundry, whatever it was.  Change some laundry?  No, into laundry.  Into lingerie.  Change into lingerie.  Oh, lingerie?  Yeah, I like this.  She just got off the fucking plane and a bus and a train.  She's got she's cranked ass.  Well, I guess that'd be late.  I guess it'd be a little bit late.  Maybe she should shower.  I'm having time.  Yeah, I guess that would be what she'd do first.  Wait, don't force him to make this girl watch if you didn't want her to watch. 
[03:15:00]  But she's sitting on a plane and a train and a bus.  I like the fact that the way Patrice yelled at Roland for Springsteen, Bobo just put  me in my place for the boy bands.  He goes, yeah, that kind of music.  When I brought them up, he's like, yeah, that's the shit I used to turn the fucking radio  off.  He showed you.  I was like, all right.  He showed you, Colin Quinn.  You schooled me.  So you put lingerie on.  You got some lingerie waiting for her or she got some in the bag?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I don't know exactly how that's going to work or right.  It doesn't matter because you don't really need her to have any clothes on, right? 
[03:15:30]  Exactly.  So you think you're going to drop the bags off and just have sex right away in the hotel?  No, no, I don't think.  Or she's probably hungry.  What are you going to, you know?  Well, I guess we'll probably eat the fuck.  Eat that.  Oh, the delivered pizza.  Now, there's a pizza place by you, but you're in Queens.  You're going to have them deliver pizza from Queens to Manhattan?  Well, if it.  Well, I think that this pizza is that good of pizza.  And the hotel is in Queens, too.  I was thinking, what hotel in Manhattan? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, why is she in Manhattan?  The JFK, Queens Hotel.  Well, I don't know where the hotel would be that she's staying at.  Where is the pizza place at?  I'm just using an example.  Well, if she's coming to see you, why is she going to Manhattan?  I'm just using an example of a hotel.  I wouldn't know.  Then she's staying at Queens.  She's staying at the JFK fucking.  Well, I guess maybe she'd want to stay at that Holiday Inn around Maspeth.  All right.  Is that in Queens?  Yes.  It's a Maspeth Holiday Inn.  Actually, that's a little bit closer to where I live.  Oh, then you could have the pizza delivered. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Then it'll be easy on the pizza delivery guy that I'll have deliver the pizza.  Oh.  Why don't you just buy a Giorgino's?  That is pizza.  Is that good pizza?  And plus that the delivery guy is a friend of mine.  Oh, what if the delivery guy tries to fuck your girl?  I think he already has a girl.  Oh, okay.  Do you have a friend?  Who's this guy?  Delivery guy.  I know he's become a good friend of mine because I'm a regular at that pizza place. 
[03:17:00]  You're irregular everywhere.  No, I'm a customer of that pizza place.  Oh, okay.  Right?  I'm thinking this girl might be hot, man, to be honest with you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think she's fucking around.  I think she's nervous, and I think she's a little scared.  A little hottie?  I think she's scared it's going to be hot.  She is hot.  Are you going to tell anybody?  I wouldn't mind going south on a chick from up north.  Oh, shit.  Going south from up north, huh?  Yeah.  So what does that mean?  What does that mean?  She's from Canada. 
[03:17:30]  It means going down on a chick from Canada.  I love it.  Oh.  Oh, you mean cunnilingus.  Exactly.  South on a chick from up north.  I just got a tweet.  She's going to call the show in a minute here.  Oh, shit.  Great.  Nice.  We're getting fired.  Finally.  Tell the hell we're up, man.  We'll see if she's real or not.  Did she describe what she looks like to you at all?  I've seen a picture on her regular tutorial.  Oh, okay.  What does she look like?  I can tell she's kind of got blonde hair, and she wears these glasses.  Yeah? 
[03:18:00]  Like, they look like some kind of name brand glasses.  And what about, does she look like a celebrity of any kind, do you think?  I'm not sure.  No?  I'm not sure it's a celebrity.  Is she?  What about weight?  Is she heavy?  Is she skinny?  I don't know if she's skinny or...  How do you know?  You saw a picture?  Was it Facebook magic or something?  Was she just looking like... 
[03:18:30]  All you saw was an eyeball and a nostril?  I think it was more of a face shot.  Yeah, face shot.  Nice.  But I could tell that she looked like she was probably in decent shape.  Yeah?  From her face?  Yeah.  Was she cute?  Do you find her cute?  Yeah, she does.  I have, like, a little glasses of fetish.  Because I noticed some chicks managed to wear glasses and he managed to make it look hot.  Yeah, but Bobo, just a little advice.  When you're trying to sweet talk your girl into bed in the hotel, you don't want to use  the phrase, decent shape.  You don't really respond to that. 
[03:19:00]  She looks amazing.  Wow, you have a decent body.  You don't want to say...  Don't be too brutally honest with her.  Play it up a little.  Yeah.  Girls, like when you say, not bad, whore.  Yeah.  She's really adequate.  So the hotel, the pizza.  What about any...  And she's just coming to see you?  Did she say that?  Or she got out of business here?  Yeah, it's to see me.  Just to see you.  So you're spending the whole time with her at the hotel.  Exactly.  All right.  Are you going to foot the bill for anything? 
[03:19:30]  Take her out to dinner somewhere?  Yeah, I'll take her out to dinner.  What's a nice place, you think, to take her out to dinner?  Got to be close to Maspeth.  What's a nice place?  I could take her out to...  Well, I know there's a brand new Japanese restaurant out there.  Oh, yeah?  Danny, I don't think this is a good idea, Danny.  All right.  Unless you're too damn high. 
[03:20:00]  Listen.  Holy shit.  We have I Heart Bobo on the line here.  All right.  I Heart Bobo.  This is the first time ever.  Let's get this straight.  She's been tweeting Bobo.  I Heart Bobo.  And this is the first time we've arranged it to have her talk to Bobo.  First time ever.  Here it is.  Bobo, why don't you say hello?  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi.  How are you?  Yeah.  How you doing? 
[03:20:30]  I forget.  What's your name?  How do you pronounce your name?  I pronounce it Allie.  It's over to finally hear your voice and stuff.  I listen to you all the time.  Yeah.  It's good to hear you, Allie.  Hey.  This might sound really weird, but I'm actually outside the building.  I just heard you guys talking, and I thought maybe I'll come down and say hello in person.  That amazed me.  You made that trip all the way from Canada.  How did you even know I was going to be on today?  It's amazing.  We set this whole thing out.  We've been setting this out for a while, Bobo. 
[03:21:00]  We told you to come in and do a horseshit PSA.  It wasn't about that.  I love that.  We got a hold of her and got her down here, Bobo.  It's amazing.  Is that okay?  Yeah, come up.  How do you like that?  Isn't that sexy?  The Canadian accent?  Yeah, it is.  It's a nice accent.  It's a beautiful accent.  It's a beautiful accent.  It sounds like Christian Bale.  It's a sexy accent.  It's a Canadian accent, Patrice.  It's French Canadian or something, I think.  Maybe a Newton-John.  Yeah.  It's from a Providence we don't know much about. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, where is it you're from in Canada?  Yeah.  Well, it's okay.  I live there now, but I'm originally from there.  Yeah.  Oh, where is it you're originally from?  Where do you think, idiot?  Well, I just want to...  Can I come up?  It's really cold out here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But please come up, all right?  All right.  She's coming up.  That's great.  Wow, how about that?  This is hilarious.  How about that, Bobo?  You say we never do anything for you.  Yeah, this is nice of you guys. 
[03:22:00]  We set this whole thing up just so you can meet this girl.  Bobo, the little bit of what I know, and I haven't been around that much on the show.  I can't imagine the horror that's about to be visited on you.  Well, I already know that this is a chick.  I heard the voice.  Bobo, I know it can't be someone doing an impersonation.  Bobo, I'm just telling you.  Exactly.  I know you from the show a little bit.  I can't imagine the horror that's about to be visited upon you. 
[03:22:30]  No, it's a beautiful Canadian girl.  I'm sitting here trying to imagine what's next.  You heard the Canadian accent.  And plus, at some point, people do got to be nice at some point.  Yeah, you got to be nice.  At some point, you're right.  I fear that this is not the point.  People can't spend their whole life joking with someone they know very well.  Yeah, after a while, you got to come through.  After a while, you motherfuckers got to do something nice. 
[03:23:00]  Shut up.  Colin is hugging Bobo.  Colin is hugging Bobo.  I just can't imagine the horror that's about to be visited on you, Bobo.  Bobo.  I'm trying to think what it could be.  Were you happy with her voice?  I was.  It was what I expected.  You did?  I expected some kind of Canadian accent.  Crocodile Dundee.  Yeah, yeah.  Here she comes.  I like the fact that he said, you can't be mean all your life.  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  Bobo, I want this big reveal.  So, Bobo, turn and look at the door.  No, no.  Look at the door.  That's a TV.  Look at the door.  The door.  He's going to come in the door.  The door on TV, I guess.  The only door.  Okay.  Stay on the mic.  No, no, get on the mic.  Stay by the mic.  Look, he can't wait.  He's nervous.  Here you come.  You nervous, Bobo?  Yeah, I'm nervous.  All right.  Now, bring in Allie.  You ready?  Yeah.  Bring in Allie.  Here she comes.  Here's Allie.  How are you doing, Allie? 
[03:24:00]  What do you think?  Oh, it's great to see you.  It's great to see you.  Oh, he's kissing her cheek?  You should come over here.  Wow, look at this.  Wow, this is a surprise.  I know.  I surprised you.  This is fantastic.  This is a lovely gift.  This is a lovely gift.  It feels like Christmas already.  Like a rapist.  He's looking at me.  Bobo, you are looking her up and down like a vulture.  Oh, she looks nice.  I look pretty good.  Yeah, it's nice.  This is the first time I get to see her.  I know.  This is the first time I have an image. 
[03:24:30]  Wow, she smells good, right?  She smells good.  When I get reminded of her, this is the image that's going to be in my head.  All right, by reminded, he means jerking off.  Bobo, it's radio.  Describe what she looks like.  She's got brown hair.  It's blondish red.  She's got glasses.  Right, the glasses.  She's wearing...  You like the glasses, yes?  Yeah, I like the glasses.  You look great with the glasses.  What else, Bobo?  She's got a purple button down a sweatshirt. 
[03:25:00]  What's her body look like?  She's slim.  Oh, jeez.  Did you hear that?  I'm not good at describing bodies.  Unless they're dead.  She's wearing shoes.  Oh, listen, I just says Bobo.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  I'm nice.  Do you have a boner? 
[03:25:30]  Yes, I do.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Bobo's got a boner.  I do.  I was really hoping that would happen.  Bobo, why do you have a boner?  You're just talking.  I do.  Bobo, pull your pants down for her.  Bobo, no, no, no.  You might as well.  You might as well.  We need to get to know each other.  Bobo, pull your pants down.  Why do you have a boner?  It's disrespectful.  You've got to pull your pants down.  It's disrespectful, right?  Yeah, it is.  It is.  It's disrespectful, right?  And plus, she's already seen the pictures that circulated on Twitter. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  What did you think of the pictures?  You know, he's got a nice, you know, it looks like a smelly little cock and it looks nice.  Oh, damn.  She likes it.  Bobo, show her the cock right now.  No, no, no.  It's going to ruin the moment.  Bobo, when they say no, they mean yes, by the way.  That's right.  Yeah, but here's the thing.  No, this was...  We're teaching them right.  Yeah, but I need to be respectful to her.  Thank you.  I need to be respectful to her.  Show her what she's getting into.  I need to be respectful.  That's why I like him. 
[03:26:30]  He's a gentleman, okay?  You guys, ten minutes.  I want to be respectful to her, all right?  Thank you, Bobo.  I want to be respectful to her in the best way I can.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Bobo, you kind of have to.  I don't know what's going on, Bobo, but you kind of have to.  I don't know what's going on, either.  You're looking at him.  Yeah, but I'm trying to be respectful to her.  Thank you, Bobo.  That's really nice.  I'm trying to be respectful to this lovely chick that ever since I met her on Twitter,  I can't...  Stop.  Hold on.  Calm down.  Calm down. 
[03:27:00]  I think he's got to show his penis.  I really do.  I think it's the right thing to do.  What are your intentions on the young man?  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  He's just a really nice guy.  And I just want to...  I don't know.  I feel like I could teach him a few things.  Oh.  Yeah, exactly.  Teach him a few things.  And what genre?  Exactly.  I don't want to say on the radio.  It's a bit...  Oh.  Is that bad?  Yeah, but...  Because we don't even know.  Hey, there's something I've got to say.  Everybody goes through the first time, all right?  Exactly.  Everybody, all right?  Just smoke folks becoming violent. 
[03:27:30]  I know.  Calm down.  Everybody has to go through the first time.  Calm down.  Calm down.  Testosterone.  This nigga's getting...  Look at his hands.  He's wringing his hands like sling blades.  Oh, Jesus.  Just calm down.  Not killed her.  We're on everybody's side.  We're on your side.  You've got to take your pants down, man.  Are you possibly looking to snog him at least?  Well, I mean, he said he's, you know, first time.  I mean, I've, you know, smashed a few cherries in my time.  Oh, see?  You'd have to be gentle.  You'd have to be gentle.  A hug.  Is it anything...  A bit more than that.  Is it anything now that you could do for him that's not, like, crazy? 
[03:28:00]  Maybe a good, sensual hug?  Nothing?  No, because this is a love between a man and a woman.  It's a private moment.  And do you really live in Canada?  Uh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, Canada.  Look at the front of his pants.  Oh, my God.  Bobo, why the boner from talking to a girl?  I don't know.  That's great.  She looks pretty damn hot, though, let's be honest.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tell the radio listeners.  And then they get to see her.  I know.  I finally get to see her.  I was shocked. 
[03:28:30]  Look how excited it is.  I finally get to meet her.  This is a surprise.  We have a connection.  This is just a lovely surprise that I am very thankful for.  Bobo, just rip him down.  Go ahead.  Come on, guys.  Just go.  Do me, baby.  I'll tell you what you do.  This is being respectful.  I'll tell you what you do.  You turn your...  Enough with the small talk.  Turn your back.  You don't know when she's going back to Canada.  This might be your only chance.  Hear that one.  Hear that one.  I don't want to be disrespectful.  I thought you were going to order me a paycheck.  Shut up for a minute.  Bobo, shut the fuck up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You turn your back to Bobo, right?  Bobo, rip down your drawers. 
[03:29:00]  That's right.  And then you could just do this.  Just take a quick look over your shoulder so you get a little glimpse.  That's all.  Just a glimpse.  And we want your reaction.  Bobo, go ahead.  Yank him down.  No.  You don't mind.  Yank him down.  She's fine with it.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  I see his cock.  All right.  Now, just quick.  Just over your shoulder.  Take a quick peek.  Take a quick peek at your love.  No, no, no.  Open your eyes and take a look.  I want to be up.  I need to.  Take a look at the challenge.  I need to reserve some of this love for between my pants. 
[03:29:30]  Just pull them up.  Just turn your kid and look at it again.  Come on.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  I don't want to show you his cock.  I'll turn my head.  But your eyes are shut.  Yeah, it's enough.  One more look.  Just go.  Come on.  I'm not comfortable being pants down in studio right now.  Why so excited, Bobo?  I saw her look.  What are you thinking about right now, Bobo?  I'm just thinking about the time I'm going to have with her.  Pull them off.  Oh, like the sax and stuff?  Pull them off.  Colin's yelling, pull them off.  All right.  I can pull them off. 
[03:30:00]  What?  Colin's like, pull them off.  Come on.  We need to keep some romance.  Romance.  A little romance.  What song are they playing?  So, wow.  What song is this?  I don't know.  What is it?  Some funky love music?  I like the soundtrack.  It's called We Gotta Go Home.  It sounds like early 90s.  Oh, it's Do Me by Bill Vidal or whatever there.  What was the name of that band?  Bill Vidal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  So, when...  Uh-oh.  He doesn't like boy bands. 
[03:30:30]  When are they getting together?  Like, for some kind of date?  When do you think?  Tonight?  Well, now.  Yeah, we are.  Actually, tonight.  I've got to go to work.  But tonight.  All right, tonight.  She's got something to do down here.  You've got to go to work.  Yeah.  She's got to go to work.  On your fucking vacation, you fucking asshole.  She's on a working vacation.  Where the fuck are you working at?  No, because I've got a meeting with somebody.  Don't worry.  It's fine.  It's not another guy, right?  No, no, no.  Just for people on the meeting.  You came down from Canada, and you have to work today.  Well, it's a meeting.  Yeah, it's a meeting.  Yeah.  People in New York, that's what you do.  You come to New York to meet people. 
[03:31:00]  Look at where his eyes are right now.  You are staring at our...  Can we get a better look?  Can you undo this thing here so we can get a better look?  Can I escort you to where you're going?  What's your name again?  Emma?  Allie.  Allie.  Let's just undo this goofy sweater at least.  I'm saving it for him.  She's saving it.  Saving what?  Your fucking stomach?  Be respectful to my girlfriend.  Let's take a look.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Be respectful to my girlfriend.  You got a nice ass on you.  Allie, can we as fans of Bobo's new life get a chance to just see... 
[03:31:30]  I don't know, because he's going to treat me like a lady, but I have a feeling you might  Be respectful to my girlfriend, all right?  Oh, shit.  You got to get a little harsher than that, man.  This is your girlfriend.  I'm sorry, Bobo.  I apologize.  Yeah, I apologize.  All right.  I'm trying...  I apologize, Bobo.  I'm not going to say anything harsh to you guys, all right?  I'm trying to like...  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  Please accept my apology.  I just wanted to see a figure.  What do you want to say to Patrice?  I apologize.  Bobo.  What do you want to say to Patrice?  Be respectful to my girlfriend, all right? 
[03:32:00]  Yes, thank you.  I'm sorry.  Patrice, be respectful.  I said I'm sorry.  Do you consider Bobo your boyfriend?  You got Bush down in?  Is it Bush?  It's usually Bush.  English girls usually got Bush.  Bobo, you hear this shit?  I got English.  She's Australian.  She's Canadian.  Shut up.  Oh, she Australian?  No, she's from a province in Canada that makes her sound like that.  That's definitely an Aussie accent.  It is Aussie.  But she's from Canada now.  Bobo.  You hear what Patrice just asked?  He asked if she had Bush.  I was being respectful. 
[03:32:30]  Right?  Just be respectful, Patrice.  I'm sorry, Bobo.  I apologize.  Do you shave your pussy is what he wanted to know?  Come on, Ed.  Come on, Ed.  I'm sorry, Bobo.  Come on, Ed.  Come on, Ed.  I'm sorry.  Don't allow this, Bobo.  Don't allow this, Bobo.  Come on, man.  I'm sorry, Bobo.  I'm sorry.  Does your asshole smell like false as beer?  I understand, all right?  You're Anthony being Anthony.  Right.  It's not real.  But at the same time, you could sing stuff, but just at the same time, try to be respectful  of my girlfriend. 
[03:33:00]  Yes.  Right.  Now, do you consider Bobo your boyfriend?  Well, I mean, I don't even know what's going to happen.  I've been following for so long, like now.  Would you give up the sugar for Bobo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about the ass sex he was talking about?  Are you up for that?  Without a rubber?  No.  He said he would use a rubber.  Oh, he would use a rubber.  With a rubber, Bobo, ass sex.  Bobo.  What do you think?  Can I let this happen?  Be respectful to her, though.  Yes.  I think he's right.  Be respectful to my girlfriend, all right?  Not respectful to my mother.  This sweater is form-fitting.  Can I just say anything? 
[03:33:30]  It's annoying me.  It really is annoying me.  I don't want to say anything but my heart's right.  Just be respectful, damn it.  You're right.  You're going to have to say something harsh, Bobo.  You're going to have to to stop this.  Be fucking respectful.  Hey, you.  Get your goddamn hands off her.  Yes.  So, Allie, can we take a look at the back of the video?  Be respectful to Allie.  Just remove this.  Be respectful to my Allie.  You're going to be my wife someday, Allie.  You're going to be my wife.  I should have known the back of the future reference was about to appear. 
[03:34:00]  That's pretty good.  Go ahead.  Be respectful to her, all right?  Patrice, Patrice, Patrice, be fucking respectful to her, all right?  Patrice is definitely digging the hips in the butt.  Don't fucking get my girlfriend a hard time.  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  Sorry, Bobo.  Oh, shit.  The man has spoken, guys.  Come on.  Oh, shit.  It's true.  You know?  You've got to respect the man's wishes.  He really has.  He's cursing.  Usually, you all see Sheila's on so shy. 
[03:34:30]  Usually, you know.  Yeah, Sheila.  But you're really racist, though.  But I want to make a good impression.  They are racist.  Don't try hitting on her, right?  She's with me, all right?  Here we are.  Are you trying to hit on my girlfriend?  Oh.  You ever been with Ab Original?  Are you hitting on her?  You ever had a didgeridoo stuck in you?  Are you hitting on her?  Come on.  Be respectful to her, all right?  Be respectful to her, all right?  Thank you, bye-bye.  This is a lovely moment. 
[03:35:00]  This is a lovely surprise.  Is that the sound of Bobo blowing on your ass?  That I'm being very respectful.  And using your nostrils as the fucking...  To control the sound.  Bobo, she needs some comfort.  Give her a hug.  This is Bobo playing the rusty trombone.  Thank you.  All right.  You're a real trooper.  Bobo, you better give her a kiss on the lips.  You better give her a kiss on the lips.  I didn't expect guys showing up.  I didn't expect the first time I would meet you.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, relax. 
[03:35:30]  Could you be more chalant about it?  Yeah, kiss her hand.  Kiss her hand.  Yeah, give her a hug.  Be a gentleman.  Oh, very nice.  Give her a kiss on the cheeks.  Please, I love this.  Yeah, she smells nice.  Grab her ass.  Smell nice.  Smell her hair.  Smell her hair.  She wants all this.  Smell her hair, Bobo.  She wants all this.  Look at that.  And Bobo just came.  Yes.  All right.  He actually made a sound.  He did.  Oh, sniffing.  He's a goddamn boy.  He made a fucking...  It sounded like a hound dog on a fucking convict trail. 
[03:36:00]  Look at that.  What are you doing?  Wow.  Yeah.  You're a lucky one.  The sky is a catch.  The sky is a catch.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  The sky is a catch.  Look at that.  Oh, wow.  That's what I do, man.  That's all my handiwork right there.  That is.  He's still got a raging heart.  He's working her magic, right?  Yeah.  I haven't even done anything.  That's the best way to describe it.  He's staring at your breasts, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Here it is.  Colin's publicist wants to shoot her way out of here.  I forgot. 
[03:36:30]  She has a face of police.  Someone rescue it.  I forgot.  Colin's not Colin anymore.  Holy shit.  This is Broadway Colin.  You can't be a part of this.  Colin shit.  Oh, we're fucking everything up.  Look, he's reading the newspaper.  Let Colin get out of here.  He's got to escape.  Colin, say something.  Say something.  I apologize, Colin.  This is not where a Broadway star should be.  Anyone associated with Jerry Seinfeld should not have to be in the room when this shenanigans.  The Seinfeld Mafia.  Oh, he's going to get a goddamn speech after this one. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, they're going to fucking Pesci whack you.  He's going to the fucking ref.  There's going to be an empty room.  Colin's going to go, oh, no.  Oh, what happened, Bubba?  It does be something.  I think it'd be a really neat idea to take her to see your show.  Oh.  You think you got tickets?  Oh, how about a couple of complimentary seats?  Give up some tickets, motherfucking.  Hey, Colin, Allie.  Two tickets for the show tonight?  Yeah.  I would love that. 
[03:37:30]  We would love that.  Am I right, Allie?  Yes.  The publicist just said no.  Oh, my God.  I saw what she did.  She went like this, side to side.  She's tweeting God right now to get her out of here.  She's tweeting Jerry Seinfeld to call Colin.  Jerry, please call Colin right now.  Colin, get out of there.  What are you doing?  Thanks, Colin.  Get out of there, Colin.  You're ruining the show.  Oh, shit. 
[03:38:00]  This is bad.  Congratulations, Bobo.  Yeah, Bobo, you got a keeper.  Thanks, Patrice.  Why don't you give her a nice, long hug?  She's been traveling all morning just to see you.  This is second to Michael Richards at the Comedy Store for Jerry Embarrassment.  Aw, you're very sweet.  Thanks, darling.  Grab her ass.  Aw.  Grab her ass.  No, you're going to wait for tonight.  Oh.  I'm trying to be respectful to her.  Did you feel her breasts on your chest? 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, you got a good squeezing there.  Bobo, did you?  Well, I'll be honest, and I say yes, I did, all right?  Oh, wow.  But I'm trying to be respectful to her.  How are you respectful with a boner?  You're standing there.  You cannot be respectful gawking at a girl's breast with a rod.  Unfortunately, it's just nervousness, all right?  If I wasn't so nervous about this.  That's what I get before I get on a roller coaster.  So I got a raging boner, because I'm nervous.  No, it's just I would be able to control the boner. 
[03:39:00]  I rage.  I would be able to control the boner if this was more, like, expected to happen, but I  didn't expect you'd be here in the studio.  Like, if you walk into a room during your birthday and everyone goes, surprise, you  pop a rod.  No, no.  It's the unexpected.  No, no, that's a little bit different, all right?  A little bit different.  I got you.  It's a bit different when you got a chick that's been on your mind.  Ah.  What's that call for, buddy?  All of a sudden, showing up here when you didn't expect it.  If your nervous boner lasts more than four hours, seek medical attention.  What are you on?  A 36?  38? 
[03:39:30]  38-D?  The whole time that we're talking, he's trying to find out my brother's eyes.  Try to be respectful.  Come on.  38-D.  Patrice, Patrice, be respectful to Allie.  All right?  Be respectful to Alice.  I'll fucking kick your ass, Patrice.  Oh, damn.  I'm sorry.  If you try not, if you try to be respectful, all right?  I was trying to get you an idea of her sign.  All right, but try to be respectful.  Because listen, listen, I'm trying to hurry.  Bubbo.  Be respectful right now.  I'm not here to harm anybody right now. 
[03:40:00]  Women love when you buy them undergarments and things like that.  So I was trying to get her sign so you can buy her some jaws, buy her bra.  She'd appreciate it.  Fuck them up, Bubbo.  I would ask her that off the air.  Be disrespectful.  In a respectful way, all right?  He's being disrespectful.  I'm sorry, Bubbo.  I'm just trying to help you.  He's cock blocking, Bubbo.  I'm not going to.  May not get off, Speed.  Speed. 
[03:40:30]  You're right, Bubbo.  You know what?  You're right.  When you put it like that, man, I'm sorry.  I'm out of this, man.  When you put it like that.  When you put it like that.  When you put it like that, Bubbo.  Bubbo.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That hit through.  I thought you were going to say something else.  Oh, man.  But that one hits through.  That was not right.  That's not right.  Oh, fuck.  That was like racism from 1952.  I know.  Knock it off, Spade. 
[03:41:00]  See?  Knock it off, Spade.  What do you say, Dame?  What do you say we ditched this, Spade, and go out on the town?  Nah.  Let's catch some Spades at the Cotton Club.  Nah.  Nah.  Spade.  Hey, God.  Nah.  Nah.  What's he doing here?  Oh, my God.  This is a No Spade Club.  See?  Nah.  Nah.  You know what he is. 
[03:41:30]  Nah.  Nah.  You're right, dude.  You're right.  You're right.  When you put it that way.  You're right.  You shut up, Patrice.  That's tough to do.  Oh, God.  It really broke through him.  He goes, when you put it that way.  He goes, when you put it that way, with blatant racism, yeah, then he can see that he's not fooling around.  So, look at how he's looking at her.  Do you see that look?  It's out of the corner of his eyes.  It's the corner of his eyes.  And he's not looking at her face.  He's looking, like, between her fucking thighs and her neck.  Well, I'm just trying to look at her. 
[03:42:00]  At the same time, I'm trying to control the boner here.  Hey, the publicist, let her go.  She's shaking.  She's shaking.  She wants out of here.  She does not want to be in here.  Her fucking legs are shaking.  She's trying to hold up.  She's going to burst.  You want to wait outside, gorgeous?  Go ahead.  She's bouncing.  I know I see uncomfortable women when I see it.  I'm sure you do.  No, uncomfortable women.  Trust me, Alex.  Patrice is an expert at this.  She needs to leave. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, yeah, see?  You want to wait outside?  Oh, you're cold.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's a publicist's answer.  That is a good one.  You want out of here.  I'm freezing.  Oh, Bobo.  So, you were asking if you could escort her to where she's got to go.  It's a meeting, though.  Wait a minute.  Before you continue here, just say one thing.  Yeah, but I've got to escort her onto the location of this meeting.  Hold on, grab the mic.  It's a little far.  Here's why America's finished.  Because right now I want you a beautiful shot.  I think it's only respectful to Escalade.  Son of a bitch.  Colin, talk.  He's trying to help you out. 
[03:43:00]  Are you going to do this during his show when you're fucking sitting there?  No.  Bye-bye.  I'm going to be in the audience.  Well, he told me, motherfucker.  No, I'll be in the audience.  I'll be in the audience.  I'll be talking, right?  Yes.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Mr. Quinn.  See, he said, I'll be.  Yes.  No, it was just that we're in the middle of this fucking demonic goddamn ritual.  And I was watching the last vestiges of Once Was Once America was.  They're going, and we're chopping down in Putnam County, the new Rockefeller Center tree. 
[03:43:30]  Christmas tree.  Yes, yes.  I saw that.  I just thought the dichotomy was very interesting.  It is very interesting.  And you know something, Bobo?  The Christmas tree.  At the time scale.  You could bring a Rockefeller Center.  I don't think it's up yet.  No, they're putting it up, though, in a couple of days.  Yeah, but it's not going to be lit yet.  What are you?  Hey.  I just should have seen his face.  Yeah, but it's not going to be lit yet.  What's the point of looking at the tree when it's not lit? 
[03:44:00]  Fuck me, Ron.  I don't know.  I thought you people go down there and they look at the tree.  Even before it's decorated lit, they watch the scaffolding around it.  He says yes, but he says, what's the fucking point?  I've seen it before in years past.  I've seen it before.  Thank you, Colin.  And it's not the same.  The whole thing up.  It doesn't have the same effect.  I was setting the whole thing up for Ali.  Exactly.  Not you, dummy.  Exactly.  She's never seen it.  I've seen it.  She's never seen it.  You've seen one, you've seen them all, Mr. Redundant. 
[03:44:30]  She's seen plenty of eucalyptus trees.  In Canada?  I'm letting Ali know from someone who lives here in New York, it's more better to look  at the tree lit than it is not lit.  Much more better.  Much more.  It just looks like any other tree.  So where the fuck are you going to take her to Mass Path Mall?  Come on.  Take her ice skating down there.  I'll take her ice skating at Bryant Park. 
[03:45:00]  Okay.  Yes.  I'll meet for a few days.  Bryant Park has the new head.  Yeah, he's right.  That's the new edgy one.  Do you ice skate?  He's a heavy one.  I go ice.  He's on it.  As a matter of fact, I do go ice skating at Bryant Park a few times every year.  Listen to Patrice.  He'll teach you.  Why don't you take a ball pulling in Queens?  Patrice, I just said before, be respectful to Ali.  You did say that.  You must have forgotten.  Be respectful.  Don't say anything to her.  Don't make him break out anything more harsh than he did. 
[03:45:30]  Be respectful to her, all right?  I'm sorry, Ali.  That's okay.  How old are you, by the way?  Oh, good question.  I don't know, because I'm a little bit older than him, and I don't know if that's going  to be a problem.  That's okay.  It's not going to be a fucking problem.  No, no.  Believe me.  That's okay if you're a little bit older than me, all right?  If you have a fucking heart and a scar on your leg, it's not going to be a problem.  If she's missing a leg, it wouldn't be a problem.  Yeah, it's not a problem.  How old are you, by the way?  28.  Oh, 28.  How old are you?  I'm 28.  Are you the same age?  You're not 28.  You're not 28.  I am. 
[03:46:00]  Wow, we've got such a nice young...  I'm turning 29 in April.  You're lying.  April what?  I'm not lying.  April 30th, 2011, I'll be turning 29.  When's your birthday?  What's your sign?  January, Capricorn.  You're a Capricorn.  Oh, look at that.  Hey, man.  The Ram.  Wait, January?  The Ram.  Oh, it's coming up.  What are you going to get her for her birthday?  Well, I got to know about her. 
[03:46:30]  Something would come all over it and slobber it.  During this time, that's the thing, during this time, she's in New York, I'll be able to know a little bit more about her.  Something she can only hold with fucking two fingers.  Sometimes, you've got to remember, before I can get someone a gift, I want to know about the person, so I have an idea what to get.  Let me tell you something.  What do you want?  It's a first birthday that you're spending together, so maybe some jewelry might be nice.  A little jewelry for the girl. 
[03:47:00]  Because maybe I can wear the jewelry and nothing else.  Yeah, exactly.  Boing.  Maybe I'll get you some nice jewelry for your birthday.  There goes Bobo again.  Oh, there goes the boner.  Fuck.  Fuck me, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Just the jewelry and nothing else.  And once he finds out this whole thing, that's very provocative.  Well, I, maybe I'll get you some nice jewelry on your birthday. 
[03:47:30]  You can get a necklace or something, not a ring.  Rings are a little too presumptuous right away.  Exactly.  Get her necklace.  Nice little necklace.  Maybe some earrings.  On her birthday.  Diamonds, right?  Mm-hmm.  You like diamonds?  Mm-hmm.  Diamonds, Bobo.  She needs diamonds.  Exactly.  I'll get her a nice little necklace on your birthday.  How are you going to afford a diamond necklace?  I don't know.  I might have to ask one of my relatives for help.  I'm going to have to bump off a gas station.  I'll ask one of my relatives for help. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, you've got to remember, I don't have a lot of money.  Oh, Bobo.  And by a lot, he means any.  Bobo, don't tell her that.  Yeah, make believe you have a lot of money.  Yeah, Bobo, say it's all tied up.  You're just not liquid, except in your pants.  I don't know how to say it.  I mean, not everybody.  And everybody has a lot of money, all right?  No, don't say you have a lot of money, but don't lie, but just don't tell her you don't  have any.  Yeah, yeah.  I do got some money, all right?  She wants to feel protected.  All right.  He's got some money.  He's got some money.  It's invested. 
[03:48:30]  Right.  I help out part-time for one of my relatives with his moving and storage business.  Hey, tell her you're assistant to the assistant theater.  Movie donor to whatever the fuck it was.  He was moving and storage business.  I can't even remember the line.  I'm so fucking dumbfounded on how he ended this.  I've got to sometimes use some of the money to help out my mother at my house.  So where does this go from here, then?  Yeah, where are we looking at?  Allie, what are we doing after the show now? 
[03:49:00]  What's going to happen?  Well, I already know we're going to go see Colin's Broadway show.  That I know.  I'll probably go ice skating at Bryant Park this weekend.  How long is she staying?  Yeah, when are you going back?  I'm here for a few days.  I'll go on Monday.  Monday.  Yeah.  Well, we'll probably go ice skating at Bryant Park this weekend.  How are you going to pay for that?  Yeah, but she's leaving Monday, Bubba.  You've got to do something that's going to get her going before she leaves.  Well, here's the thing about Bryant Park, all right?  You're only paying for it. 
[03:49:30]  You've only got to pay to her.  Listen, don't tell your fucking cheap dates, you fucking asshole.  You're telling her your fucking budget date?  No, that isn't it.  You're going to take her to free things?  What are you going to take in the back of Wendy's when they throw the hamburgers out?  No, no, no.  Bryant Park is not free.  Yeah, but what's the scam over there?  I want to hear now.  Free Bryant Park!  Free of all!  I thought you meant it was being oppressed.  Actually, it's free if you own your own ice skates.  Unbelievable. 
[03:50:00]  But you don't.  Why would you pack ice skates?  How is he going to get out of this, man?  I don't know.  Who would have heard of a Canadian that doesn't own an ice skates?  This is going to be devastating, Patrice.  Yeah, why doesn't the Canadian own an ice skates?  How is he going to get out of this?  I don't know.  Maybe I'd pay for the rental.  I don't know.  I'd pay for the ice skate rental.  Emotionally, how is he going to escape this today?  I don't know.  It's going to be bad.  He'll see something shiny.  I would pay for the ice skate rental.  You think so?  I don't care because it's Friday.  Fucking goldfish?  That's what I say to myself.  I would pay for the ice skate rental. 
[03:50:30]  I would pay for the rental for you.  Oh, thank you.  Make me.  That's great.  I got my own ice skates.  What's your health?  You know, we were talking about bullying.  Hey, what's the bill of health there, Allie?  Where?  You got anything happening that no one sees?  Anything?  Be respectful to Allie, all right?  But I mean, even some kind of...  Because he's like he is.  We're talking about genetic.  Anything predisposed?  Disposed, is it?  Predisposed.  Anything?  Any fucking sickle cell anemia?  No, no. 
[03:51:00]  I'm pretty intelligent, all right?  What?  Not you.  No, no, not you.  We know what we're saying.  If you guys go further...  Are you predisposed to any type of genetic problems, congenital failures, or...  No.  No?  No.  You sure?  Healthy.  No.  Healthy.  No.  No.  What the hell is this?  I don't know where it's going.  What is it?  Anything?  No.  Colin's right.  What is it?  You know what it is?  It's a long story short.  Ah.  Helen Hayes Theater.  Telecharge.  Telecharge.  Telecharge, yeah. 
[03:51:30]  Colin Quinn's great one-man show.  Eight shows a week.  Three on Saturday.  Yes.  Three on Saturday.  Three on Saturday.  Well, let this motherfucker go so he can sleep.  All right.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying here to see what the hell goes on here.  I don't know, man, because no one knows how this fuck is ending.  I'm not leaving.  We have something to tell about.  Ending with a noose.  Oh.  Right?  No, no.  You don't have nothing to tell Bobo.  What?  No, we've got nothing to tell Bobo.  Nothing to tell Bobo.  We have nothing to tell Bobo.  Nothing.  Anyone got any ideas? 
[03:52:00]  Sam?  You have nothing to tell Bobo.  Travis?  She said she had to go to a meeting.  Yeah, I'm going to go to a meeting.  Oh, she does have to go to a meeting.  She'll call you later.  All right.  She'll call you later.  I can come back.  Is that cool?  All right.  Take it easy.  Yeah, yeah.  Come back later when Ron and Fez are on or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bobo, follow her out.  Go to your meeting.  Follow her out.  Walk or tour a meeting.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to your meeting.  You two kids just have a great time together.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, Allie.  Bobo just threw the fucking head.  Oh, Jesus.  Bobo, we've got to grab you. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, Bobo.  Bobo, what happened?  What the fuck is that about?  What did a big dummy fucking club soda Kenny just do to you?  Yeah, Kenny just blocked me before I could even get her cell number.  He literally cock blocked you because your cock is out.  So you couldn't get her cell number right away.  Yeah, I couldn't get her cell number.  Well, he knew we wanted to talk to you a little about your meeting.  She's gone.  What did you think about her?  Be honest now that she's gone.  I thought she was lovely.  Lovely.  She had big, she was a roomie. 
[03:53:00]  She was a roomie.  She was a roomie in the hips.  She was a roomie.  Would you help me with this roomie?  She was a little roomie.  That was nice though.  You were looking at her tits a lot, weren't you?  She had some places to go, man.  She was nice, and I thought that was a lovely early Christmas present.  Yeah?  It was her showing up here in studio.  I didn't expect it.  It certainly was.  How are you going to get in touch with the little Brian Park?  Yeah. 
[03:53:30]  That's the thing now.  How the heck am I supposed to get her cell number?  Ow.  Why are you, like, you're playing with yourself through your pocket and you're dancing in  place like you're doing the pee-pee dance.  No, I just had my hand on.  Do you remember what I said to you right before she came in?  What did Colin say to you right before she came in?  What if she was not who she really was?  I said, I said, remember what you said, guys, friends have to, at some point, stop breaking  your balls and do something? 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  And I said, I shudder to think of the horror that's been visited on you.  Yeah.  I thought these guys would stoop to something like a transvestite.  I never thought they would stoop to an actual emotional connection that would shatter your  fucking Friday, but that's just what they did.  This was the most brutal thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.  This is fucking horrifying, Bobo.  Fuck.  It really is. 
[03:54:30]  Fuck.  I don't know how to resolve this.  You guys better give him some money or something.  I actually, I thought there were weapons of mass destruction there.  Now we're in and I don't know how to get out.  You know what?  I'm in a quagmire.  You guys better give him some cash or something.  We gave him two tickets to seat call.  Just stare at that one empty seat call.  His horniness is fucking contagious.  Like it's, I'm trying to get it off my back.  Yeah. 
[03:55:00]  Well.  No, everything's good.  Right, Bobo?  Everything's good.  Everything good?  You okay, Bobo?  I'm trying to figure out who this is.  It's Bobo.  No, no, no.  Who this chick was?  Oh, oh.  Yeah, who was that chick?  Yeah, who was that chick?  Was she really the one that?  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, no, man.  Somebody's got to tell him.  No, somebody doesn't have to tell him anything, man. 
[03:55:30]  It was his, that was his woman.  She had to get out of there real quick.  Who was that girl?  Oh, shit.  The public has a right to know.  Kenny.  Yes, Kenny.  So did Kenny?  She's really pissed off at you.  You blew it.  What happened?  No, come on.  What happened, Kenny?  I'm sure it's her.  I don't know.  I just walked her out.  She's like really mad.  What did you do, Bobo?  Why is she mad at me?  I don't think she's ever going to talk to you again.  Oh, no. 
[03:56:00]  Was it the boner?  She didn't want him pulling his pants down?  I'm really surprised at you.  What did I do?  Exactly.  Wow.  That's harsh, man.  I mean, I was going to escort her, but then you blocked me.  Because she told Kenny, don't let him follow me.  But, Kenny, why did you stop her from coming out?  I didn't.  She ran out of here.  I thought you did.  What do you mean you thought I did?  I thought you did.  What's wrong with you?  I bet that boner's gone. 
[03:56:30]  Don't blame this on me, because you fucked up your dream date.  I didn't want...  I tapped out 20 minutes.  I just need people to know.  I really thought this was...  I really did.  This is really fucking psychotic.  I'm really...  You guys have gone evil.  It's like fucking Lord of the Blind.  I was blocked.  I was blocked.  Have you fucking lost your mind?  I was blocked.  I gotta be honest.  I tapped out easily 20 minutes ago.  I was blocked. 
[03:57:00]  I was blocked.  You were blocked.  Being able to follow her.  I was in Lord of the Blind.  I'm very sorry.  Jesus.  You were blocked.  Let's just leave it at that.  You were blocked.  Fine.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  I'm very sorry.  Well, I don't think...  Who are you apologizing to?  Yeah, who are you talking to right now?  I'm very sorry to this chick if she's listening.  I'm very sorry to Allie.  I'm very sorry, Allie. 
[03:57:30]  All right?  No.  I'm very sorry.  Apologize to her.  I'm very sorry, Allie.  Her Twitter account has just been deleted.  Oh.  This is...  It's been deleted?  Yeah.  Apologize to her.  I'm very sorry.  For what?  I'm very sorry that I didn't follow you that time.  All right?  I was blocked.  I was blocked.  I was blocked. 
[03:58:00]  What more could I say?  Tell the truth.  This is...  I'm telling you...  Well, I thought I was.  There's two women that associate...  I thought I was.  Their faces are horrible.  I thought I was.  It's like watching...  Like they're watching the baby seal.  I thought I was.  It's worse.  I thought I was.  It's worse.  I can't stand it.  I looked at her face.  This is just...  This is so...  At least we made it easy for Colin's last appearance. 
[03:58:30]  At least we made it easy for him to never show up again.  Bye, Colin.  I thought it was.  Thanks, Colin.  Bye, Colin.  Tell us how it is in the new world.  Yeah.  Club Seinfeld there.  Go ahead, Bobo.  I thought it was.  Bobo.  Maybe someday I'll get an apology from her.  Why does she have to apologize to you?  No, no.  Maybe someday I'll get some response to my apology.  Oh, oh.  Bye, Carl.  I hope I'll get the response to the apology. 
[03:59:00]  I don't think you need it.  Ladies, I just got to say I'm sorry.  I'll get some response, all right?  Thank you so much.  And I can't even contact her on Twitter because I don't have good internet access.  Take it easy.  Have a good weekend, ladies.  Please.  I'm sorry.  Opie, take it easy.  Contact me on Twitter.  My cell number.  Sam, later.  Direct message me.  Everybody's gone.  Whoever needs you.  Where are you going, Bobo?  I'm just...  This has just shocked me. 
[03:59:30]  That she just believed that I wasn't blocked when I was.  What are you going to do now?  What's wrong?  I know she'll contact me.  No, she won't.  I know she will.  Probably not.  She's pretty, um...  She's pretty angry.  She will.  That was the shortest romance I've ever seen in my life.  Well, I was blocked.  I was blocked, all right?  What was I supposed to do? 
[04:00:00]  Push Kenny away and then force the issue even more?  Was I supposed to do that?  Roland just peeked his head in.  I did not want to get into a fight with Kenny.  And he'll look and shut the door.  All right?  He's horrified.  If I'm blocked by Kenny, I'm not going to push the issue further, all right?  I do not want to get angry and attack anyone like that.  It's over, man.  She's listening.  What do you want to say to her? 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  Ah, that's true.  Man.  So bad.  It's a short-lived romance.  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  I feel...  If I really could not control my anger, I would attack Kenny.  But I'm not.  But I don't know if I could look at Cops and Kenny the same way.  With love?  Well, you'd be nice.  Right?  Now I just got this image of Cops and Kenny. 
[04:01:00]  Like, it's going to be pissed off at Cops and Kenny.  He did...  He pretty much wrecked it for you, didn't he?  Right?  If I couldn't control my anger, I would have beat him up.  Really?  Yes!  Kenny's a black belt.  I know that, but I'd still try to.  Your anger...  You're so angry, I think it would transcend physical skills.  You would have...  Exactly.  Being angry...  Yeah, yeah.  I would have ripped his cock off. 
[04:01:30]  Do you know, she wanted to...  She wanted to...  She wanted to...  She wanted you to follow her, and when she turned around and you weren't there, she was  like, oh, she got all mad.  Yeah, but that is...  I saw out the window, she was very mad.  It got us somehow...  It'd be nice if there could be some kind of apology arranged.  An arranged apology?  Well, some way she could hear it.  I'm just saying.  Now, I don't know if she heard my apology.  Yeah.  If she...  I don't know if she heard it. 
[04:02:00]  Now, I'm just gonna have to go on Twitter and try to message her on Twitter.  Yeah.  I don't know what to...  I don't know what to do in this situation.  You know what a broken heart feels like now, Bobo.  You know, better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.  That's a big saying, you know.  For those short few minutes you had together here in the studio, think of how happy you  were then, okay?  Don't dwell on the negative that happened minutes later. 
[04:02:30]  Think of the earlier minutes and the happiness you felt.  Bobo, how did you feel when you first saw her?  You smiled.  I was happy.  You locked eyes.  There was a...  I was happy.  You got a boner.  You felt...  I was happy.  I met her.  Think of those happy times.  I was happy.  That gets you through the breakup.  I was happy.  That gets you through the breakup part, though.  Don't dwell on the evilness that was these past few minutes.  Think of ten minutes ago when it was bliss. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, right?  If any ladies out there feel sorry for me, contact me on Twitter.  Jesus.  I don't think Twitter can handle the bandwidth.  Radio Bobo 202.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you got to remember, the word radio is...  The first letter is cap.  And Bobo is also...  The first letter of Bobo is cap.  Okay.  Yeah.  Bobo.  Think of how you felt.  Some people never feel that love that you felt.  I felt happy to know her. 
[04:03:30]  That you felt between 10 and 10.30.  Most people don't feel a love that strong.  I was, like, happy to meet her.  To finally meet this chick.  Remember your boners?  Yeah.  Remember the boner you had?  Remember your boner?  Yeah.  I remember.  Damn.  It's so hard after the relationship's over.  Especially spending so much time together, like you did, face-to-face like that.  I know.  It's...  Why are you doing a Heil Hitler? 
[04:04:00]  Your arm keeps going up like you're Heil Hitler-ing.  It's just me.  It's just me nervous about this.  You're nervous?  You got a boner?  No.  I hear tell a boner...  You pop a boner when you get nervous, Bobo.  I'm hoping you'll understand it.  Apology, all right?  It's just a thought and knowing how sad it's going to be.  What?  I'm going to end up this ticket to Colin Quinn's show.  Oh, that empty seat next to you.  I'm going to end up...  You got a place to put your playbill.  I don't know about that.  I'm not going to waste an extra ticket. 
[04:04:30]  I might...  Who are you going to take?  I might just...  I might call up a friend of mine, ask him if he wants to go see this show.  Danny says he wants to go with you.  Yeah, I know.  Maybe I want to go see an actual friend of mine that I actually know really well.  An actual friend, not this piece of shit.  I mean, you are a friend.  We talk every day.  Yeah, you guys talk every day.  I know that.  But maybe I feel like being nice to a friend of mine, all right?  I'm just saying.  Now, what does it feel like to know that you were so close to actually having sex and now 
[04:05:00]  that you're going to be in bed tonight and you were thinking you were going to be in  bed tonight with her, right?  Yeah.  Now you're going to be alone again in bed.  I know.  Yeah, it's going to be sad.  You think you'll cry to sleep tonight?  It's going to be another lonely night of jerking off in the toilet for Bobo.  Tears on your pillow?  I don't even know if it's too sad to even jerk off.  Wow.  Too upset to jerk off.  I don't think that exists.  But Bobo, there's new Snooki pictures online.  Yeah.  What about Snooki, right? 
[04:05:30]  You can jerk off to Snooki.  Even though you had a real woman that would have taken care of you if you didn't blow her  off at the door.  If you didn't blow her off at the door and you wouldn't follow it around.  It's not the same thing as a photo.  You blew her off at the door.  You can't do a photo.  You blew her off at the door.  I was blocked by Kenny.  No, you weren't.  I didn't see that at all.  I was.  I saw it.  I'm a witness to it.  I saw it.  I saw it.  I was trying to be respectful and everything and it got ruined.  It got ruined.  I don't know if I could look at clubs on Kenny the same way again after this. 
[04:06:00]  How were you looking at him?  No, I mean, I was like being nice.  I was saying, hi Kenny, how's everything going?  Oh, cordial.  Right, yeah, exactly.  Oh, well, listen.  Yeah.  A Bobo song.  She's gone.  Oh, what went wrong?  What went wrong?  Again, he blocked me.  Yeah.  I'll never get her phone number. 
[04:06:30]  I'm really concerned about that.  Stay tuned for Ron and Fez on these very stations coming up right after we leave.  Thank you.  Have a great weekend. </pre>
