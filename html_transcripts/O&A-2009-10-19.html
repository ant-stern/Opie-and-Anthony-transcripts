<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a fiery discussion of the Balloon Boy hoax, dissecting the family's unconvincing story, highlighting the children's questionable behavior (seen in YouTube videos showing them handling feces and boogers), and criticizing the initially supportive local news and sheriff.  The hosts speculated the hoax was a publicity stunt aimed at securing a reality TV show.  A caller, Patrick from Boston, alleged the sheriff knew it was a hoax from the start but delayed revealing this to gather more evidence.  The segment continued with further criticism of the news coverage, specifically noting a commentator’s hesitant skepticism, and detailed the charges filed against the family (conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, false reporting, and influencing a public servant), alongside the significant cost of the rescue operation.  The conversation then pivoted to a critique of local sports teams – the Jets, Eagles, and Islanders – including complaints about poor officiating in baseball, especially a controversial Derek Jeter call. Callers Eddie St. Louis (discussing potential Yankees and Mets player acquisitions) and Matt (suggesting an NFL-style challenge system for MLB) contributed to this segment, which also touched upon plans for using Yankee Stadium's big screens to show other games to boost revenue.  The hosts also extensively criticized the Nassau Coliseum, recounting a negative experience with a boisterous San Jose Sharks fan.  The segment concluded with a caller’s question about post-orgasm sensitivity, leading to a discussion of sexual practices and sex toys, followed by a brief mention of a Rush Limbaugh lawsuit and a transition to a “Jocktober” segment, briefly introducing a caller from Tampa Bay before cutting to the next segment.

The Jocktoberfest segment detailed humorous anecdotes from the celebrity autograph signing event, including a deaf Lou Ferrigno receiving compliments on his "Hulk" performance from an oblivious woman.  The hosts recounted encounters with various celebrities: Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Rick Flair (whose negative reaction to a previous show segment was discussed), Ernie Hudson, and a reportedly miserable William Shatner.  They also mentioned seeing Rudy from *Used Cars*, expressing difficulty finding the film.  A significant portion focused on a scathing review of the Tampa Bay radio show "Chad and Christy," mocking their on-air personas, excessive music, and repetitive dialogue.  Several clips were played to highlight their awkward interactions.  In-studio guest Steven Lynch joined the show, discussing his father's recent death, sharing anecdotes from his career, his upcoming Carnegie Hall performance, and his move back to Michigan.  Darkly humorous banter about death ensued, and Lynch recounted a funny memory involving a radio prank on his parents.  The segment concluded with details about Lynch's Carnegie Hall show and his new CD, "Three Balloons."

The following segment centered on the hosts’ and Stephen Lynch’s shared interest in crime shows like *First 48* and *Bait Car*, featuring graphic descriptions of criminal acts and frequent profanity.  They discussed the absurdity of criminals' on-camera behavior, including their incriminating statements and reactions.  Racial stereotypes depicted in these shows were also discussed.  Lynch performed several songs, including one about smuggling drugs on a plane, and discussed his experience in *The Wedding Singer*, including negative reviews comparing him to a turnip. He again mentioned his Carnegie Hall performance. WWE wrestler Maria Kanellis called in to promote a charity burger event with Sharon Osbourne and Cyndi Lauper, prompting playful teasing from the hosts.  Sam Roberts and E-Rock then joined, discussing their Big Apple Con experience, detailing E-Rock's distraction by toys and the high cost of celebrity autographs.  Big Kev, a comic book collector, recounted purchasing expensive, rare comic books at the convention, leading to a discussion about inflated memorabilia prices and celebrity encounters.

The final segment recounted the hosts' experiences at Big Apple Comic Con, highlighting the surprisingly short lines for celebrities like Mickey Dolenz, Virgil, Eddie Furlong, Tom Wopat, Ernie Hudson, and Gil Gerard, contrasting this with longer lines for the Batmobile and a modified DeLorean.  An anecdote about Eric, a crew member, running out of money for autographs was shared, followed by ribald commentary on the arrest of James Michael Tate for bestiality.  Partial interviews with the Iron Sheik (expressing a desire to "humble" Brian Blair), Nikolai Volkov (clarifying his role in a planned "humbling" of Hulk Hogan and Brian Blair), and a relentlessly positive Tom Wopat were played.  The hosts also discussed Lou Ferrigno's perceived uncooperativeness and the high cost of autographed photos, especially from William Shatner.  The segment concluded with a brief interview with Anthony from the show, describing his own underwhelming experience at the Con, and promising to continue the interviews the next day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's get the show on the road!  Oh, God. That's the worst intro I've ever heard.  What happened?  I hope they didn't spend too much time on that.  What happened?  Back to the drawing board, boys.  That was lackluster.  Oh, my God.  I was hoping for a grand new opening.  Oh, yeah.  With pomp and circumstance.  Yeah, it's a lot of pomp and circumstance.  The same basic deal as the old opening.  Right.  But with different things.  There's no energy in that. 
[00:00:30]  No, it was just kind of, you know, there were funny lines, but...  All right.  Back to the drawing board.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Who told you that Balloon Boy was a hoax from the beginning?  This very program.  Who told you?  This very program.  And then the stupid media took, what, three days to finally catch up with something we said?  No one realizes this show has a bullshit detector.  It's a built-in bullshit detector. 
[00:01:00]  And we know.  Friday, I hope you guys were listening.  We're yelling and screaming at all the local newsreaders saying, this is a fucking hoax.  Just one stupid network.  Go with it.  Yes.  Say it's a hoax.  We said, just go with it.  It's obvious.  You got the kid puking because he's got a sour stomach.  You got the kid also saying, we did it for the show.  Or you said, we're doing it for the show.  Yeah.  The father's acting was horrendous.  He's sighing, which is a tell.  Yeah.  That you're like, oh, fuck. 
[00:01:30]  I'm in deep shit here.  So what do you do?  You usually.  I think he would have prepped a little bastard better, too.  Yeah.  Well, he's six years old.  What do you expect from a six-year-old bastard?  He said we did it for the show.  Yeah.  I don't expect exactly amazing acting, but I would expect a little more than that.  Yeah.  A little rat.  Well, how about this?  If you're going to do a publicity stunt and a hoax, supposedly there's other people involved,  maybe a network.  Yep.  You shouldn't involve the six-year-old kid.  Absolutely.  You should all of a sudden have the kid hiding somewhere, but he doesn't know why he's in 
[00:02:00]  the attic.  And then you tell the story.  And so then when they question the kid, the kid's like, I went off and played and I ended  up hanging out in the attic.  Yeah.  You know, you don't actually have the kid in on it.  Okay.  We're doing this for a show.  Right.  So you're six years old.  I hope you know this.  Yeah.  Have you seen other videos of this family?  Not really.  Have you seen some of the other ones?  I've been watching them where the father's paying the kids a dollar to pick up dog shit.  Really?  And the little kids are running around going, I got some shit. 
[00:02:30]  Like they're all cursing and stuff.  I found it very funny.  They're picking up dog shit with their bare hands and their hands stink.  And then one kid starts crying.  It's like, he threw shit at me.  Where's this clip?  I gotta see this.  Oh, they're all over YouTube.  All right.  I'm going to go home and watch it, man.  The kids are a scream.  Now, they're saying they did this for a reality show, right?  Yeah.  Or to try out so someone would go, whoa, this family needs to be on TV.  A little interest. 
[00:03:00]  You know, I'm going to go out on a limb here.  They get their reality show.  You know what?  Why not?  They get their reality show.  That's a pretty interesting family.  It's not going to be on one of the bigger networks, but I tell you, they get their reality show.  They get it.  They pulled what we call the Rupert Pupkin.  Because, I mean, if the kids are running around picking up dog shit and saying, I got shit, who doesn't want to see that?  Yeah.  There's another one where they're picking boogers and putting them in food.  For real?  And they're like brother's food.  Nice.  And they're mother's food and shit. 
[00:03:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  Fuckers.  They're hysterical little bastards.  Who I really want to yell at is the sheriff.  I picked up on this.  So, Friday, we left everybody by saying, look, someone, just one lousy news outlet, say this is a hoax and start beating this family up.  And none of them would do it.  They were waiting for the cue from the sheriff.  So, I don't know why this was.  By the way, it was saying that this wasn't a hoax.  Right.  That's the audio we got.  So, I think it was Saturday. 
[00:04:00]  I'm watching TV and a big press conference.  So, turn on the tube.  Oh, yeah.  And here's the sheriff from, I guess, two days ago.  We believe at this time that it's a real event.  Certainly, people are free to speculate.  They're free to be skeptical about it.  But those of us in the law enforcement profession have to operate on facts and what we can prove and not what the public might think without any proof. 
[00:04:30]  He might not want to watch it either.  Just in case, he's probably making sure.  He's trying to hedge his bet.  You know what, though?  He should have said, we are looking into this to see if this is some type of hoax.  They were giving the family too much of the benefit of the doubt there.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  You got the kid, like I said, puking.  And he admitted on TV.  Yeah.  You said we were doing it for the show.  Doing it for the show.  Why would you say in your press conference that's very suspicious to us and we're going to look into that further? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Not, at this time, we believe that this was a real event.  Yeah, don't say that.  You can even say, at this time, we believe it's a hoax.  And then say either one.  Then the sheriff continued two days ago.  You know, the suggestion to us that perhaps this boy had been coached or coaxed by his parents to hide and remain still in this attic for five hours during the duration of this event just seems inconceivable.  It seems much more likely that the boy was, in fact, frightened because he somehow thought that he was responsible for this device becoming untethered and therefore decided to hide. 
[00:05:30]  That seems like a very credible story.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  Did you think that at all when this was going down?  No.  I immediately thought hoax.  Especially when they said this guy had been on a couple of, you know, reality shows and things like that. 
[00:06:00]  It's like, oh, stop it.  And that wacky balloon with the wacky little thing on the bottom, it wouldn't even hold.  It can't hold anything.  It can't.  It could barely float with its own weight.  All this stuff in the news isn't saying anything about it.  Now they are.  Now they're brave because now they know it's a hoax and a publicity stunt.  So now watch the coverage today.  Oh, real brave.  Is that supposed to be the video of the thing actually becoming untethered as the kid is in there and the family's freaking out? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Is that what that's supposed to be?  The acting's horrid.  Yeah.  Look, look.  They're there and then the mother.  They're like, oh, no.  Wait a minute.  I think little falcon's in there.  And then they're right.  Wait a minute.  Where's the kid supposed to be in the actual balloon?  In that little bottom part.  What bottom part?  That little thing hanging off the bottom of that little cylinder.  Little cylinder, yeah. 
[00:07:00]  You can't have a kid in there.  Of course not.  This is the dumbest fucking thing that they've fought.  I don't know.  The audio sucks on that, right?  I don't know.  It's just somebody's mix, I think.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  So there's the sheriff.  And then finally, I guess yesterday, he changed his tune.  This is, it has been determined that this is a hoax, that it was a publicity stunt. 
[00:07:30]  We believe that we have evidence at this point to indicate that it was a publicity stunt done with the hopes of marketing themselves or better marketing themselves for a reality television show at some point in the future.  Now, someone has a theory.  I want to go to Patrick in Boston.  Congratulations on your patriots, by the way.  Holy mother of God.  Holy mother of God. 
[00:08:00]  You've saved some of those points.  Let me tell you something.  Here in New York, they gave us the Jets-Bills game.  Boy, lucky us.  Who won that?  Let me start it, Jimmy.  It was bad.  It was 6-3 last time I saw it.  I was in the gym.  The Bills won in overtime.  The Bills had a backup quarterback.  The Bills are one of the worst teams in the NFL.  The Jets stunk.  Sanchez sucked.  Sanchez looked like a chump.  And we learned a little fact about Sanchez, which was fun for us Jet fans. 
[00:08:30]  He never practiced or played in the cold before.  It's good for a football player.  And it showed yesterday.  Where's he from?  He's from Southern California.  Ecuador.  He had the privileged life where it was nice and warm when he played in high school and college.  He never practiced or played in the cold before.  Don't you think that could be a problem in the NFL?  Yep.  I tweeted, could someone throw him in a sauna and warm him up so he could make a fucking pass?  Now the 3-3 Jets. 
[00:09:00]  3-3 Jets after that fine start.  They looked so good at first.  Look, man.  The Saints game.  Yeah, I understood.  The Jets had their hands full.  Of course.  The Dolphins game.  Then you're thinking, eh.  Now they lose to the Bills, though?  Forget it.  Bills.  Fuck.  Patrick.  Yeah.  So what did Brady have, what?  Five touchdowns?  Passes?  Brady had snow.  We're going against Tennessee.  I mean, you know, they didn't know what to do with it.  They looked like, you know, little animals that had no idea what to do with snow. 
[00:09:30]  So, yeah, it was something like 10 million to nothing or something at the end.  I don't really watch it.  Well, it ended up 59-zip, which was kind of a bummer because everyone really wanted to  see even more points than that.  But Brady went out in the third, and it was 52-zip, and then the game ended 59-zip, yeah.  Could have broken 100.  That would have been hysterical.  Break 100 in a football game.  Come on.  How great would that have been?  Beat the shit out of him.  But fuck, Brady, I don't know. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, did you guys really play a tough team?  I mean, there's going to be major changes now.  You watch.  What do you got, Patrick, on the sheriff?  The sheriff has said in a couple of interviews that they knew from the beginning that the family  was pulling a hoax, but they didn't want to tip off the family any further.  So they said in official statements, much like if they were doing an investigation of  an actual crime, that they withheld that.  But they said, oh, no, we don't believe that.  So that the father would entrap himself. 
[00:10:30]  So that he would, you know, he would run out of his house on interviews.  That's a good out.  Plausible deniability.  I'm so gullible.  I believed it.  And I was twittering.  Oh, no.  Where are your twitters?  I'm concerned for the little lad.  No, I twittered.  I twittered that there's a kid in a balloon.  I hope he's going to the Virginia Beach funny bone.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I was going to say something else, but I'm like, just my luck.  I'll twitter something, and they'll fucking pull a dead six-year-old out of a balloon.  You'll be fucked.  Ten child balloon. 
[00:11:00]  Rescue Emporia.  I was chasing them all over with a stick like it was a piñata.  Goodies fall out when you hit it.  That's what I was wondering where you were on Friday, Jimmy.  You were the guy trying to grab the balloon as it softly went.  Yeah, we saw that guy.  Oh, that guy.  Maybe you could get to him before the authorities get there.  I wish the military would have shot that thing down.  Wouldn't that be great if you could, like, look back, like you knew nothing was really in there?  If you just started fucking taking shots out with a rifle?  Horrified public's watching. 
[00:11:30]  And you only get that bad boy down.  Hey, Patrick, right on.  Maybe the sheriff's a smart guy after all.  I don't know.  And also, check on Gawker.  There's an interview with a guy that actually was hired by this doofus with the balloon to pull the hoax.  He has emails back and forth, so, yeah.  All right, cool.  Check it out, boy.  Thank you, Patrick.  I would have then, if I was the sheriff, I then would have said something like that.  I would have said, well, we had an ongoing investigation that we didn't want to compromise, 
[00:12:00]  so we had made a statement that said that it was not a hoax, so we could then, like, say something so you don't look like an idiot.  Yeah, and it would be well within your means, right, at that point to say that.  Well, the sheriff continues yesterday.  After Falcon was found, they didn't even hesitate to allow us to talk to him outside of their presence.  All of these things were very suggestive to us that it was, in fact, a real deal. 
[00:12:30]  If somebody was trying to contract or somebody were trying to make something like this up,  we certainly would not expect them to give us the access that they did or the level of cooperation.  Again, after the fact, we have since learned, as many of you have, that these people are actors.  Not only have they appeared in several reality television shows and on YouTubes,  we have since determined that, in fact, they met together.  The way that they met and established their relationship was in acting school in Hollywood. 
[00:13:00]  So, needless to say, they put on a very good show for us, and we bought it.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Ugh.  The interview with Wolf Blitzer was so obvious.  Yeah.  Ah.  Ugh.  Do you know who kind of picked it?  I'm telling you who I think suspected it was Fox.  I want to say it was Shepard Smith.  One of the guys over there definitely said something, yeah.  And Fox said, a boy possibly in balloon. 
[00:13:30]  And the way he was talking, you knew he smelled bullshit.  When he said, I think this is a bunch of bullshit.  Well, he said, I hope they get a mule to kick that cocksucker's teeth in.  I was like, that's inappropriate, sir.  It's got to be a hoax.  But I think he just didn't want to say, like, this is crap, just in case they pull a dead kid out of there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to get all frozen from being up too high.  Brr, I'm cold.  And finally, here's the charges.  We believe that at some point we will be presenting a case filing to the district attorney, recommending the following charges. 
[00:14:00]  Conspiracy.  Contributing to the delinquency of a minor, which is a class four felony.  False reporting to authorities, which is a class three misdemeanor.  And attempting to influence a public servant, which is a class four felony.  All right.  How could there be a misdemeanor filing a false report?  How is that a class three misdemeanor?  I don't know.  I don't know how that should work. 
[00:14:30]  Lying to the cops like that?  But I mean.  Yeah.  But then once you get conspiracy in there, now that's a problem.  Now that's a problem.  Yeah.  Messing with the authorities.  They're in deep shit now.  And then they say perhaps some restitution for the search where, you know, I think a Blackhawk helicopter is something like $4,600 an hour to run.  Oops.  And that was up there for quite a while.  And then there's a couple other copters and the ground crews.  And this guy could be in for quite a few bucks.  Oops. 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  He's got his reality show.  Yeah.  Here you go.  He's not going to be getting paid for it.  You broke ass motherfucker.  Eagles lost to the Raiders.  That was brutal for everybody in Philly.  Raiders aren't that good this year.  No.  And the Eagles lost to them.  And then what they did here in New York, were you watching the Baltimore fucking Minnesota game with Brett Favre?  What, they put Heidi on?  Heidi.  See, that's an old Jets.  Oh, oh, oh.  Very good.  No, I didn't see that. 
[00:15:30]  So, Brett Favre is undefeated, won again.  This game was amazing, going down to basically the last second.  Two minutes left in the game.  It's 4 o'clock, 4.05.  They go, due to contractual fucking things, we have to go to the Bills-Jets game.  Jet game.  And I'm a Jet fan.  I'm like, fuck, I can handle missing the first few minutes of the Jet game.  This is the best game of the week. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, so they did.  They cut it off.  So you invest all this time in the Vikings game there, and then they cut you off with less than two minutes left in the game,  where I think at that point, Minnesota was, I forgot exactly, but it was really close.  It was ridiculous.  Minnesota was up by two.  Okay, right.  Yeah, because then they had the field goal that could have won it all that we never saw.  Yeah, we all got to miss the last second missed field goal.  Yeah, last second missed field goal.  And the Vikings got lost.  To watch the Jets go three and out on a drive or something.  Great.  No.  No, not even that.  Oh, no, the Bills hit a field goal. 
[00:16:30]  No.  The game technically didn't start.  It was just the coverage of the game.  That's true.  They had to go to commercials.  Bullshit.  They can't figure that shit out in the year 2009.  Give me a fucking pip something.  Pip.  Give me a pip.  Hey, pip.  Come on.  I need a pip.  Give me a pip.  It's like, why even have the game on if you know at 4 o'clock you're going to just dump it anyway?  Yeah.  You're investing time in something where you don't get to see the conclusion technically.  That's true.  You'll probably find it on a line somewhere, you know, as it's gone.  But at that point, it's happening so fast. 
[00:17:00]  You've got to run to your computer, try to dig it up.  Yeah.  And then you see at the bottom, they're showing the clock countdown in that game.  Yeah.  Pretty much before they even started the Jets-Bills game.  And they had to start with a commercial too, by the way.  Yeah.  So, like, we're going to leave this game to join the Jets-Bills game.  But first, these words from our sponsors.  Oh, that's the important part.  I was like, great, thanks. 
[00:17:30]  They've got to make the cage.  Right.  And then, of course, well, the Yankees.  2-0.  Now they're going back to Anaheim with the old Angels.  Angels, wow.  Kind of an error-prone little team there.  They kind of get a little nervous, I think.  But they make a couple of mistakes.  The Yankees were supposed to win their home games there.  What?  No.  Bullshit.  That's how it always works.  The Yankees were supposed to lose that second one. 
[00:18:00]  Supposed to lose that second one.  The Yankees should have lost that second one.  Fuck that shit.  First of all, the goddamn stupid first base ump blowing that fucking Jeter call.  The guy was safe as a motherfucker.  Even watching on TV without slow-mo, you could totally tell that Jeter was completely safe.  Jeter was fucking safe.  I mean, it happens too many times.  The cameras are so goddamn good now in baseball.  I remember watching my grandfather watching the old Mets games.  He'd sit there in his chair with the remote going plink, plink, to change the channel 
[00:18:30]  and just talk about how the Yankees are a bought team.  Ah, the Mets.  The Yankees are a bought team.  And he'd watch the Mets, and it was one shot from fucking behind the pitcher.  That was it.  And that was what you got.  Now it's like, you know, you see, hey, let's look at the pitcher's grip on the ball,  and you see the fucking threads on the balls right in his hand.  So all these shots now, they could freeze these shots where you see the ball makes contact 
[00:19:00]  with the guy's glove.  Is the foot on the bag yet?  Or vice versa, the foot's on the bag.  Yeah, they don't need the umps anymore.  The ball's not in the glove yet.  And that one wasn't even one of those weird fucking, like, well, it was pretty close.  Yeah.  He was so obviously safe.  Yeah.  Safe!  Ah, it's just dramatic.  Of all the dramatic things!  No, I mean, but the Yankees, they said they faced them twice, both times.  Yankees won the first game.  They had to lead the second game, lost it, and then lost the series.  The Angels terrified me, and I always couldn't believe they won the second game. 
[00:19:30]  Let me tell you a little bit about why they won.  Mr. October.  A-Rod.  I've got to say it.  Mr. October.  The new Mr. October after being a bum the last few.  I know, who saw this bum?  He was Mr. June for a long time.  Yes!  And the guys just come up.  The one thing Yankees have are fucking, they got the bats, which is great.  Um, and, uh, uh, pitching, not shabby.  I haven't followed us.  Milky Cabrera just seemed like- 
[00:20:00]  The milkman delivers!  All he does is hit ground ball double plays.  Well-  I'm starting to watch it now, because they're doing well.  I'm bandwagging him back on.  I was gonna, like, bring that up, Jimmy.  I noticed that, yeah.  It's hard not to.  It's kind of hard not to.  I like Girardi.  It's like, I like the way he's running the team.  And it was like, eh.  Occasionally the milkman delivers.  I didn't even realize, I completely, like, forgot that Girardi played under Torrey, the  first year Torrey was, uh, managing.  I wouldn't know.  It's like, fucked up, if it turns out, you know, well, it looked that good. 
[00:20:30]  Girardi played with Jeter.  Yeah, yeah.  And Rivera.  And Rivera and Posada.  And Pettit.  Yeah.  That's, uh, I mean, I'll Pettit, no!  Getting back to the cameras and stuff, they should, they don't need the umps anymore.  They should have one ump that's somewhere, like, you know, like, you watch Deal or No  Deal and the banker's in that weird room and you don't really see him and there's a shadow.  Yes.  That's how they should do the games now.  Yes.  And you just wait for that shadowy person at the stadium to make the call as he looks 
[00:21:00]  at all the footage.  Because the little fucking rectangle on the side of the screen, the strike zone.  That's awesome.  When, when that ump calls a fucking strike when it's a ball and they show where, they  show the track of the pitch where it was and everything.  You sit there now and go, motherfucker, you missed it by a mile!  See, you should turn that into a drinking game.  Oh, please.  I, the whole game's a drinking game.  If a pitch is thrown, he drinks it.  Yes!  A pitch isn't thrown, he drinks it.  That could be a good, there's no game that night.  The catcher catches it. 
[00:21:30]  That's a sick whack.  That could be a great drinking game, though.  All the missed, uh, strike calls.  Yeah, yeah, that was a ridiculous fucking play right there.  Yeah.  He's so on!  You don't even need the freeze frame!  Motherfucker.  Have you seen the Jeter play?  I was actually doing the gig.  I didn't see that one.  Do they have the slow-mo?  They called him out on that?  They called him out on that, and you could still see.  Wow, I could be.  You know, I'm seeing it for the freeze.  And watch, watch.  Watch this. 
[00:22:00]  He's on the base!  Oh my god, it's not even close.  Terrible.  That's a terrible call.  Yeah, that was a bad call.  They've given the Yankees some really shit calls.  Although there was a double play that was probably a double play that they didn't call on the Angels.  No, that wasn't a nice one.  I mean, look, they were arguing that they would usually...  The neighborhood call?  Please, you have to touch the bag.  I hate the neighborhood call.  You have to touch the bag.  You have to touch the bag.  And they said he was just being consistent because he had touched the bag on every other double play. 
[00:22:30]  But on that one, he straddled the bag, didn't touch it, threw the ball, and he didn't call him out at second.  So, fuck him.  Fuck him!  I say.  Oh, the umpire didn't give him the neighborhood?  Nope.  Oh, good.  Good.  Let's say hi to Eddie St. Louis.  Look at this, look at this.  How are you guys doing?  I just wanted to do a couple of things.  First thing, I wanted to get your opinion on a potential Yankees-Phillies matchup.  My old man's from the Bronx.  I mean, I'm a Cardinals fan, but he told me that's the only team that scares the hell out of him.  Also, there's a lot of talk here about that choke artist piece of shit. 
[00:23:00]  Matt Holiday potentially going to the Yankees or the Mets.  So, I mean, you know, I don't know.  It just kind of confuses me.  Also, the third thing is that the commissioner, I really have no faith in this guy.  It's like you guys have been saying, but the high def and the sports replays, there's no reason why there should be a bad call ever again.  I agree.  Yeah, it really, especially in playoff fucking ball, it's too much power for the umps.  And to not even have the capability of arguing with these motherfuckers and saying, look, they never reverse their fucking calls. 
[00:23:30]  And sometimes it's blatant.  It's fucking blatant.  And they're just around the field.  Fuck you.  I said it.  That's its law now.  That's the umpire's union.  There should be a play like Safe and Out.  You should absolutely get a certain amount of appeals.  Balls and strikes, you really can't.  No, I know, it's so subjective as to the batter's height and the ump.  They talk about consistency. 
[00:24:00]  If he's calling high balls, strikes, then he's got to call it that the entire game.  You know, that's kind of hard to argue.  But a play like that at first base, where obviously he's safe.  And that was a key fucking play.  They were out on that one, and that was it.  Well, they're going to have to figure something out, because it's becoming more and more obvious that the technology isn't making them look stupid.  I mean, this freeze frame, you couldn't freeze frame when we grew up and we were watching baseball. 
[00:24:30]  See that?  You were lucky you got a replay, a fuzzy fucking replay from 10 miles away.  But when they did finally figure out freeze frame and all that, it was blurry, because they couldn't really go frame by frame yet either.  It was more of a smear thing, if you remember.  You couldn't see the ball.  It wasn't digital and all that shit.  Now it's completely frozen in place.  It was some guy trying to push pause at the right time.  I think, here!  yeah and now they could go and now it's perfect two seconds later they got a high def 
[00:25:00]  fucking the ball doesn't even have it you could still you could read the side of the  fucking ball not only that but like the the amount of replays that they can go to at any  given time i have no idea how they do that so many angles like the angels pulled i think like  four double plays like in consecutive innings and so they just go ask the four double let's take a  look at some of the other double play and like they just had them all ready to go and had a drop  overhead like i just don't understand how they do that how about the produced highlight reel of the  game you're watching like somebody putting together with music and fucking well you know 
[00:25:30]  the big plays and everything right up until the last one that was made before they went to  commercial there's just one guy that's his whole job though building that as they go but you know  something like that back in the day when there's like a really long at bat you know it's like nice  and then they show you the picture progression so i mean like how'd they know that was going to be  a long at bat so some guy just has to do that every batter yeah they do that absolutely what's really  impressive is when they say coming up next inning and they show you sure they say uh let me see let's 
[00:26:00]  say how to matt what's up matt hi ob hey matt what's going on uh there's a bunch of major league uh i guess  team owners and then all of the national league who want the nfl type of approach where the manager  can challenge the play and they would only be in the the playoffs but if you challenge and you're  wrong if your team's batting you get assessed an extra out or if you're in the field you start the 
[00:26:30]  next inning with one out i know don't start fucking with the game like that jesus how about the end  there's got to be yeah but how else can you penalize them if they're wrong they only get a couple a couple  of games you get the choice of what player you want kicked out of the game oh shit imagine that  one that would rule you out yeah i don't know how they would get that done i don't know and then we  were talking about how um they're opening up uh yankee stadium tonight for the game this afternoon 
[00:27:00]  for the game so you could sit there and watch it on their big screen at the stadium you notice this  is happening more and more i was saying this i was starting to trickle in but i think this is going  to be just the thing to do starting real soon dude i was saying this why not they're building these  stadiums a lot more like malls and entertainment complexes and they want people to come in even  when there's not a game going on right so they'll have the concessions open the restaurants things like 
[00:27:30]  that uh the museum shit like that and uh you'll be able to come in sit down and watch the game from  anaheim on the big screen at yankee stadium but they're going to make money because they're letting  people in for free for free but i would make money off of the concession but i was telling you they're  just kind of warming everybody up they're getting you hooked it's like the crack man here try a little  here's a free seat for you yeah here try this yeah here's a ten dollar beer motherfucker and then 
[00:28:00]  you're gonna be sitting in that stadium going you know this ain't bad i'm gonna i'm gonna do this  every fucking time now this is nice and the yankees are taking notice and they're going all right  now it's time to charge yeah maybe charge a little it'll be a low fee like low i bet you they  get you for twenty dollars a head yeah go in there sit there watch the game in front of it you know  roll around go to the hard rock in there do some drinking some eating yeah watching the game with  other fellow fans that's the uh the new stadiums the future why not man why are these stadiums to sit 
[00:28:30]  there they sit there these giant buildings uh that sit there completely off limits no one in  them for so many months well everyone's well as a goof they let like a high school sports team play  or something yeah the bad news pairs something like that let the kids play right and you're able to get  a couple hundred people in the whole stadium to watch the high school game stop you know they're  really trying to figure out how to make more money out of these stadiums they want people walking  around even if the field's empty dude let me tell you about a place that is a shit fucking hole 
[00:29:00]  fucking have had it oh who went to a game this weekend i'm gonna start something on twitter that's  gonna be ugly i think i am sick of going to the national coliseum for new york islanders games  the place is a shit hole because you know my wife's from philly and stuff i get to go to philly and and  and i i've been to a few philly's games the fucking um flyer games it's sick the presentation that's 
[00:29:30]  going on this place is a shit hole the consent the the food sucks the seats suck my my back all day  yesterday was aching the seats suck they came and like throws a bone and pad up the seats a little  bit something nice the place is a shit hole and i have had it you know what you know you feel like  you're watching a minor league hockey game well you kind of feel like that when you're watching  the game no i know i understand i trust me i understand that but i lived in some of these 
[00:30:00]  places where you didn't have professional sports so you had like you know minor league like i lived  in rochester and buffalo had you know their minor league baseball team whatnot and honestly it has  that same feel it doesn't feel like a professional fucking team is that just because like put it this  way if the islanders were really doing well or at least mediocre don't you think maybe they'd they'd  put a little more into saying we need a new uh fucking arena they've been trying to get that done  forever i don't know what the fuck's gonna happen i don't even know you can't even figure out what the 
[00:30:30]  hell's going on with that anymore it's just it's an awful old dated piece of shit building they have  like these little smoke machines when the players come out like that just go that's their big special  effect and i've been to like i've been to arenas where they have indoor fireworks and the islanders  have and the smoke is just making everyone cough because it's just horrendous old school smoke  machines that poof a little smoke as the islanders go through oh it sounds great that's how the intro 
[00:31:00]  the the line up every day i don't even remember the last time i was at the nassau coliseum it could  be 20 years just go it's it's it's horrendous it's no reason to it's freezing in there  i understand you got to keep the you know the ice rinks like a little colder i think the newer  fucking arena's figured it out they figured it out a little bit cold but the people won right  you sit there yeah and you have your coat on the whole game it's like this see you really  yes old school you don't really have to i guess but it is cold it's you definitely notice that there's 
[00:31:30]  a bit of a temperature drop yeah uh it's just horrendous and once again the ice ruins it  and i was sitting in front of it i was sitting in back of a big fat fucking san jose sharks fan that  i i tweeted some videos that are pretty good oh yeah she had she was so goddamn obnoxious  goddamn obnoxious what is unsexier than a woman in a sports jersey or a sports coat 
[00:32:00]  she's drinking fat pig she's drinking and just like the whole section's like like shut the fuck  getting belligerent yeah can you can you go to my uh thing there i want to i want to see a big fat  back nice did she have a wide shoulder to shoulder huge and she was sitting by herself she flew in for  the game she's one of those fans go down that's all my jet nonsense right there they go to the first  one yeah let me go to the other one there we go this is san jose shorts 
[00:32:30]  shut up your glasses  you had good seats well i have really good seats for the uh the game for the shittiest team in the 
[00:33:00]  nhl they're pretty easy to get how did fatso get a better one than you yeah she was one row in  front of you one one row better oh and then i got her back is in the island of scored and i was  screaming her in her face could you show that one too dan just be great to see a puck fly right into  her teeth yeah she swallows it and keeps cheering the one right under it yeah there we go and then  now she's sitting there all sad because she's like an uber fan watch this  you are obnoxious we were going at it the whole fucking game 
[00:33:30]  bitch hey you know what though in the end 4-1 yeah so she she's got the best in your face  no she admitted by the end of it that she's just a big she said this i'm just a big fat  super fan oh well she flew in to see the san jose sharks at the coliseum 
[00:34:00]  then down in philly and then i think they're playing the rangers tonight i'm not really sure  one of those so she's watching her team three you know three games in four days or something like  that how does the person afford to do that like just i never understood you like flew in i can see  for one game but you got an airfare unless you're staying with people what do you do right sometimes  you know you find yourself in a city and you're like holy shit my fucking team's in town this weekend  that's fun and then you try to get a ticket i never did that she's probably a burden on somebody that 
[00:34:30]  lives here you mind if i stay with you i'm just flying in for the game you know she takes 20  fucking layovers somewhere so she paid 50 for the airfare maybe yeah then she just saddles her fat  self with somebody what if i break your couch for the weekend uh it's just such a fucking shithole  though really is pressing there's rumors that the islanders might move toward uh city fields because 
[00:35:00]  they might build a little another stadium or over there a little further uh out there's rumors that  they could be part of the whole better the whole brooklyn thing look go somewhere where we can get  a nice arena and you know and maybe feel like we're in the nhl maybe some uh some subway access to  access right like that if it was by city field something like that you get some subway access now  you're getting people from uh the city and jersey can uh enjoy the game all kidding i'm gonna drive out  the fucking the middle of long island right here all kidding aside man i i mean i love my hockey but

[01:06:30]  acknowledge that some of these shows are doing uh the you know radio the right way i have no faith  until i walk in on any show to be honest with you i was listening to it on the way in and i was like he  was the guy was making me laugh i'm like all right there's some funny stuff and then i went  and did the show and it was like they weren't hokey it was just like kind of let me just be a part of  what they were doing hokey just yeah fucking talk with your real voices and try to talk about real  shit exactly that's all we ask and we'll acknowledge you it's like chan and christy all right yeah  brings it back uh to chan and christy aunt uh on tampa bay's new magic 94.9 soft and contemporary 
[01:07:00]  they're a magic station oh you never see those oh by the way speaking of jocktober yeah someone  tweeted me i read all tweets i just can't fucking write everyone back at this point i appreciate  fuck you is much too important no i try but it's almost impossible but i read all uh all the fucking  the tweets you know the show we were talking about in portland yeah someone brought it to my attention  and there's an article so it's fucking true the guy we beat up yeah who remember oh his wife lives 
[01:07:30]  somewhere else and and oh she was on vacation or something he said she was gone for two weeks or  something like that or a mom or whatever he's retiring and someone wrote i think i think you  guys might have gotten home and it was the final straw and he finally said you know what fuck this  i'm done i'm done those guys are right i'm done with if you want to find the article i don't know  how you would find it oh that's funny but that's what jocktober is all about making you realize 
[01:08:00]  one of the shows we feature the guy announced i think friday that he's done he's retiring  he finally said fuck it it's too much of a coincidence but he's buying a machine gun and  headed to new york he was the guy that had the the car like you sort of he had the mustang but not  talking about the mustang but he said he had a girl car yeah yeah he didn't go all in with his  mustang yeah he got the convertible and they were saying what are you going through a midlife  crisis remember that guy said that's it yeah he's done gave it up he's fucking done he's had it 
[01:08:30]  good for him i hope i hope we had a little a little to do with that i hope this is chad and  christie's moment of clarity today yeah all right let's get into chad and christie they brag that  their morning show has more music than display their own can we just i'm sorry it says anger on the  air what listeners don't know about talk radio oh i don't know what that might be anger on the air  who is that guy they're talking i have no idea bob durgan i don't know him do you know him for 
[01:09:00]  real i've never heard of him he's going with my cowboy hat thing randy rhodes they're showing  okay she's a political talker i didn't realize she was a beast i thought they were talking more  anger uh like shock truckish stuff what listeners don't know about talk radio she has fucking hair  like ozzy in 1981 yeah even though her name is randy rhodes that's a coincidence her hair is atrocious  what they don't know yeah find out what this is about yeah there might be something there just  wanted to alert very good alert the uh crew uh so chad and christy chad and christy tampa 
[01:09:30]  brag that their morning show has more music you never want to brag that your radio show has more  music less talking that means that you're not supposed to talk as much that's management telling  you just play music because we have no faith that you talking can hold an audience let the music  do the talking right yeah they're my friend i have their friend  i love the river i say good night to it every night and good morning every morning 
[01:10:00]  what was the two lines we got we got two more lines from that commercial  what was the food the the food oh wow fuck i fucked it up too yeah whatever i was trying  to sing into it i will get into that it's not working all right chad and christy bragged that  their morning show has more music then display their unmatchable chemistry by each joking about  their workday whistle promotion and instead of laughing responding with okay and they're married 
[01:10:30]  yeah for real yeah the new magic 94 9 soft and contemporary and voted number one again for the  most music while you work and we're the home of the number one for the how do you how are you voted  for the most music you either are or you aren't right it's not like something that can be voted on  you think you just count the songs right and why would you voted why would you vote what their 
[01:11:00]  slug line is yeah like i vote you most music while i work talks like that i vote you the home of rock  and roll that voice is irritating too huh yeah all right let me back it up slightly good most music  while you work and we're the home of the workday whistle we are giving you two chances every weekday to  win a thousand dollars and i was listening uh yesterday or the day before where the person who won the 
[01:11:30]  money was like screaming you know at the top of their lungs and i thought wow if you're at the  workplace maybe not such a good idea because that's when people generally go hey yeah you won that money  um can i borrow like uh 10 bucks for lunch today okay first of all i would totally be screaming if i  won a thousand dollars secondly i would have no problem telling you no you cannot borrow without  uh ten dollars from me for lunch okay they're married yes what do they do at home okay they're 
[01:12:00]  married they they eat each other's toenails they don't have chemistry they're married oh that was  they both answered with okay from now on when you guys make jokes the other one should just say okay  look okay uh yeah you'll have people at work they're gonna have ten dollars for lunch i  so who cares if someone asks you for ten bucks yeah if you still got 990 yeah yeah plus a prepay back  right yeah who gives a shit i got a gram what the fuck ten bucks i'm like you're gonna buy a house 
[01:12:30]  with it okay okay what a bad joke oh i'd hate to win that kind of money all of a sudden people  crawled out of the woodwork for nickels good amount idiot very funny amount ten dollars for lunch kevin  from connecticut i wonder if chad and christy use those voices at home when they fuck eat and shop  there is an old radio bit that was like on one of those prep services where you know it's the dj at  home talking with that voice as he talks to his kids and his wife i if i had a thousand dollars 
[01:13:00]  uh i would uh you know be screaming too okay  wow that was uh that's a great start to jocktoberfest  they've been married for like 14 years i think ah that was 40 seconds they could have you know had  another pop song in there yeah they probably should have had some more music chad and christy talk 
[01:13:30]  about arnold and maria chad does an incredible arnold impression not another  arnold impression no no strap in kids strap in and he also like he does his great theory on uh  who wears the pants in that relationship all right oh i bet i bet that's contestant  how to save a life from the fray on the magic morning show with chad and christy well some would  say one of the best ways to save lives is to not let people talk on their cell phones while driving 
[01:14:00]  what a fucking pussy you are don't you understand you're a man don't these guys understand they're  supposed to be men it's a safe life what the fuck you should be making fun you're like yeah i  fucking do that and i do a lot of other things while i drive yeah well there's no phrase song that you  could seg into so naturally yeah if you say that oh there's no soft song a little soft song to  yeah that's the fray i know this song everywhere hey gonna be saving people 
[01:14:30]  on those cell phones cell phones are pretty dangerous aren't they sweetie okay yeah yeah okay  you guys are probably be voted as the least music played how does that make you feel i like it 
[01:15:00]  are we in commercial i lick my sweaty balls  stop talking and start sucking those are some of the outtakes uh when they think they're on  commercial don't you want to hang out with that guy hey who doesn't i'm coming you dumb  bitch i love this guy i'm gonna fuck you in the mouth i'm gonna fuck you in the mouth  are you tarryton hanging out of his lips what a man's man like my sweaty balls not like this guy 
[01:15:30]  i'll lick my sweaty balls he's sweaty in there exactly knows they are i'm gonna come down your  throat you fucking well better swallow it all you let one drop spill and i'll whip your ass so hard  you won't sit down for weeks it's probably a radio guy and now back to the music  wow is that fucking awful all right here we go i'm looking at that creepy boy from the grudge by 
[01:16:00]  the way balloon boy chat and christy yeah let's get into this how to save a life from the fray on the  magic morning show with chat and christy well some would say one of the best ways to save lives is to  not let people talk on their cell phones while driving yeah probably so so california one of the  first states to ban talking on a handheld phone while driving yep you have to be hands-free there  yes governor swartzenegger is the one that uh passed that bill did you see this week that his wife maria 
[01:16:30]  shriver was caught three times by paparazzi talking on the phone in her car oh yeah well and i thought  what was funny is that when contacted you know arnold said i will take swift action yeah what does that  mean that means somehow i think she rules at home that's just me so i'm thinking he might go maria  don't even say it okay yeah and another okay yeah why why maria don't even say it okay okay what that 
[01:17:00]  was arnold schwarzenegger saying okay okay and that was maria saying don't even say it wait who's who  well because see maria wears the pants ah so he came home and said maria and then she said don't  even say it and then he said okay oh he does these impersonations i swear you would think it was the real  people 
[01:17:30]  wow you also have to pay attention to every time he starts his story he goes did you hear yeah because  he started with that one and he continued hey did you hear about this one did you see in the paper  today this is some soft mushy fucking morning radio man this is just this is just dollops of whipped  cream and your wife you know that she didn't hear it you watch the news with her yeah right now he  probably goes in fucking watches some watches some internet porno you're watching the news and she's 
[01:18:00]  fucking out her hands and he's eating out of the cat box  horrendous i'm the king alice  who the fuck is enjoying this you're in your car and you're listening to chad and christy  chad and christy but this shit it's just something they give you a nice quick laugh  in between shut up sam all right chad brings up a doctor winning the lottery and tries not to  be catty yeah he tries not to be catty about this one but we all know chad 
[01:18:30]  tends to get opinionated ah boy so did you hear that the uh  who picked up on that that's good i did  everything starts with chatting everything starts with so did you hear yeah yes so did you hear that  the uh remember a couple of weeks ago when they had that 189 million dollar florida powerball jackpot  right uh they announced the winner of that today because the ticket was sold in orlando  uh-huh that much i knew so it was like well it wasn't me it was an orlando dermatologist 
[01:19:00]  okay doctor now i don't want to be catty uh-huh about a doc a guy should never use the word  never i don't want to be what is wrong with this guy he's giving catty jim a run for his money i used  oh yes that was ddur sam yes i don't want to be catty i had to use that word for about 10 years  when people asked what i did and i said i'm a caddy all right caddy but but besides that you should 
[01:19:30]  never use the word cad i had to use that when i was caught licking my hand and then washing my face  about a doctor winning hey he's got bills too okay but i love that his first reaction or when they  showed the uh press conference or whatever of him winning the first thing he said is yeah we're still  in shock and i thought yeah probably kind of like some of your patients when they get the bill 
[01:20:00]  oh stop again i don't want to be catty uh too late holy shit watch out oh stop these clips make  you speechless dude you can't you can't believe how bad they are yeah they're worse than when you  make fun of it and you do the voice yeah yeah that's the worst exchange between two people i've  ever heard and they're married ever and even on or off the radio you need a very easy joke and she's  like oh stop once again the hole oh stop like when they get the bill oh he said something 
[01:20:30]  so outrageous why should she stop why she felt she had to step in and say hey now you calm down there  are doctors out there listening she said now you stop they know what they're in for the jews always  overcharged oh good gravy and just went the other direction he wasn't being harsh enough  i i and you know they're just picturing that the the station is probably on and a lot of 
[01:21:00]  doctors offices yeah and then and the doctor yeah the doctor's there going like looking at the radio  going oh and the patient might go uh-huh right yeah the doctor just shrugs his shoulder  so they're discussing the show it's working water cooler chat yeah yeah she talks about how she went  for the a molar to be fixed and they gave her a hysterectomy so she has the whole thing with the  doctor oh christ uh you got a good laugh right now out with that womb here we go and he filled it with 
[01:21:30]  mittens he's an insane person not not hats no no i should have said hats yeah but the brim of them  gets caught in the badge mittens are so much easier because you can push them at your heel he fills the  wombs with mittens just how would you explain that in court you couldn't there's no medical procedure 
[01:22:00]  all right uh chad and christie bring up a woman winning another lottery and make a somewhat  interesting story good good good oh not good not at all entertaining yeah for some reason chan and  christie uh 87 of their exchanges have to do with someone winning money whether it's someone winning  a thousand dollars or the lottery or the scratch-off tickets so it must be hard for them not to get  catty yeah in this clip money they keep the cattiness to a minimum but they also keep the entertainment  value at the same level a minimum yes of course did you hear about the woman 
[01:22:30]  okay did you hear oh my god this guy has a  fucking crutch can you do a montage of did you hear did you hear please give me a montage of  did you hear a crutch oh my god did you hear  lou ferrigno's the guest no no no i didn't  oh my god all right did you hear about the woman in ohio that caused the mass frenzy after she told 
[01:23:00]  everybody she had won the lottery no and she went to apparently went to like a grocery store and said  i will pay for everybody's groceries up to five hundred dollars that are in this grocery store right  now wow hold on first of all it was a burlington coat factory yeah he's referencing that right yeah  well i'm assuming he probably did the burlington coat factory story two days before or something 
[01:23:30]  and liked it so much he changed the details but this isn't the story yeah why would you say did you  hear what do you two talk about off the air yeah hey did you hear during you know our extensive  show prep our drive-in yeah well do the listeners know they're married yeah then what the fuck are  they doing that's not how you do it they probably sit at home and they start conversations and then  say oh save it for the air some inane boring conversation oh look at some lady won the lot

[01:28:00]  gone like what'd you think of the show today it's fantastic really good one today really strong one  today strong very good okay good night do better tomorrow though roll over back to back yeah butts  touching yeah chad tells an extremely interesting story about what couples could do to stay together  i know it's extremely interesting because he told me it was  hey did you hear i don't think we're gonna get a please have a hated you here it'll be tough to 
[01:28:30]  put that in here this weekend next weekend or the weekend after you must make plans if you're a couple  to get scared together okay oh my she sounds cooler than he okay not saying much  but yeah she's like why are we talking about this horse shit wonder who wears the pants in that  relationship to get scared together okay i saw this yesterday and i found it extremely interesting 
[01:29:00]  that basically the couple that gets scared together stays together oh but so it was not  enough that we had children and that's been a constant scary thing on many occasions this is this is  different and it's not enough that we sit down and balance the checkbook together okay which is  also a scary thing no you must get like physically scared there are actually many things that help  keep a couple together that's just one of them and we'll explain more about this coming up in just 
[01:29:30]  a couple of minutes but let's check in now with traffic.com's rick rains so let's go when the btk  guy comes in yeah yeah they're talking about real scared they're talking about real fucking  problems not halloween btk comes walking in but that's oh i'm frightened oh that's what that  shit's based on not some dumb fucking hayride real fear real fear yeah that is a dumb fucking concept  anyway i like how they added the family thing in though like oh we had kids and that was pretty 
[01:30:00]  scary pal it's in that checkbook you know how you like to go shopping well they're at least i'm gonna  take away your charger plate at least they're talking about being married but instead of going  with each other she goes oh like having kids that was pretty scary and he goes no no and then she  then he goes bouncing the checkbook that's scary and she goes okay  you know what it kept you from having kids i'll lick my sweaty balls right 
[01:30:30]  they don't make each other laugh like on the radio or they don't have fun together  do you think they sit there balancing the checkbook and going oh boy then i'm 12 cents  off shut up do this again all right uh chad and chrissy talk about couples being scared together  again immediately after the break it's still not interesting it's the same break except there's  been three songs in a commercial so they can do it again i've got some tips on how to stay together 
[01:31:00]  as a couple i've just heard this no it's different this is a new one this is three songs and a  commercial break later i've got some tips on how to stay together as a couple okay  uh and i thought this was very interesting and very timely because tip number one they say is get  scared together because apparently the couple that scares together stays together okay and there's a  reason for it explain this to me because initially we said i i asked you wouldn't it be fun for him to 
[01:31:30]  just go well honey i i gotta tell you i got ball cancer and then she's scared and go see i was just  doing that so we could have a better relationship it'll be great if she cheered  people don't want to wake up like when are we going to hear the bit no no no that's a little  harsh people don't people don't need to wake up to that and there's a reason for it explain this to  me because initially we said i i asked you well we have children together so isn't that enough  because there are daily frights that come along with that you know someone just wrote was the 
[01:32:00]  weatherman's name rick rains no the traffic guy's name was rick rains rick rains case the roads are  slick here's rick rains rick rains yes the traffic guy rick rains that enough because there are daily  frights that come along with that and you said no different kind this this is a it's it has to do  with the fear response in your body oh and what medical experts say is the reaction that your body  has to fear or being scared where your pulse quickens you break out into a sweat you get that rush 
[01:32:30]  medical experts say it's the same thing that happens when you see somebody that you think is  totally hot uh-huh same exact reaction in your body really so go get scared together  actually correct okay i see somebody really hot i just shit my pants run away and sometimes when  i get frightened i come it's all fight or flight when you see a hot naked broad i don't know whether to 
[01:33:00]  run or punch her in the tits what the fuck is this come on really really okay  there's nothing there right no nothing a total void oh my god chad brings up another thing you  could do to stay together we're almost done by the way this is the best he contributes and gets nothing  yes things you could do to stay together ah and christy throws in her two cents uh chad doesn't think 
[01:33:30]  that's necessary though why would it not yeah just another voice one of the other things that they  suggest in here and and a lot of them you've i'm sure heard before you know leaving love notes for  each other and sort of taking a day to do that uh maybe going back and reliving your first date all  over again with someone else uh where christy and i went to see that wonderful award-winning movie the  people under the stairs well but you know what that was a horror movie so we technically went and 
[01:34:00]  got scared together so it kind of goes back to item number one on this list maybe not one of the other  things that move on i'm moving on talking to you today yeah yeah you know i didn't appreciate you  cutting me off like that uh the drive home must just be great you know you gave me nothing on that one  oh yeah they did say inviting a riot a lot of people are asking you can't invite a riot no you 
[01:34:30]  can't you can cite wouldn't be a riot if it were invited exactly an organized thing yeah that would  probably be the complete opposite courtually invited his name yeah yeah come on down you are invited  bring broken bottle all right we got one more thank god chad gives one more tip wait till you hear  what christy wants to do you won't believe it you'll never and you'll be like oh this is going  to be a tough one for chad that to deal with this one oh shit all right here we go uh and one of the 
[01:35:00]  other things that maybe you can fit in this weekend is they say guys and gals take one hour to do  something that the other is interested in when it comes to the cyber world so for women it might be  playing a video game with your husband for one hour for guys it might be spending one hour in the  women dot com chat room oh no no no i'm pulling up the sephora dot com website right now we're  looking at makeup so i gotta spend an hour doing that with you yes that's right i'll be wearing  guy liner by the time it's over  what was that is this real life why is this happening to me is this going to be forever 
[01:35:30]  you know how women in their makeup are dude that tip sucks a dick you think so guy liner gets crusty  and makes it so you can't open your eyes that's the only kind of guy liner i've ever heard the last  thing you want to do is if you're playing a video game you know having your wife play with 
[01:36:00]  you your girlfriend play with you or you ever get in a situation where all of a sudden like  there's a kid in the room and someone goes why don't you why don't you play with him and you're  sitting there like this is not fun when you're into your video game you don't want anyone else  playing with you gonna play old meat spin it'll be fun no it's it won't be fun no i was i'm doing  this it's very independent leave me alone right i'm really trying to get past this thing here and  i don't i don't want to be bothered god what happened enough no they then they're just 
[01:36:30]  angering to listen to well there you go reating chad and christie there's a million of these shows  october they continue to get yeah yeah it's amazing well thank god we got to balance that  checkbook yeah and the show has potential if you got a married couple that's really married that  have real things going on in their lives but they don't even they barely acknowledge erectile  dysfunction that'd be great just having chat about that yeah just popping viagra like tic-tacs 
[01:37:00]  still can't get a rod chat at the uh chat at the image in the in the window  yeah that old creep talking about licking ass right all right prepping the bull  yeah you don't want to hear that stuff it's early in the morning you want to wake up to something  light sam you're right something contemporary something light and airy yes all right we're  gonna take a break and uh continue with some other things stay there opie and anthony 
[01:37:30]  opie and anthony for a monday yeah doing all right though that jocktober was all right right  jack tober yeah and now we say hi to an old friend steven lynch in studio hi guys steven's back  playing fucking carnegie hall this weekend i haven't seen you guys in a while over a year i think how's  uh how's rick delgado's sister how you guys doing you guys are right  are you serious it hasn't been that long has it you can't be serious i heard about your divorce 
[01:38:00]  by the way yeah yeah i'm sorry i think you'll be okay though that has been a while yeah  you're on tour with dice that's actually accurate my heart just stopped playing all right  i get it now jesus it hasn't been quite that long you're on broadway it's been a while  on broadway hating it playing poker every night backstage  he gave him a fucking poker table yeah the wedding singer you liked that for the most part 
[01:38:30]  didn't you yeah yeah yeah that was fun going into it let's talk about something else for the first  week all right my dad just died last week so that's fun no no not really true story stop it's  good to be back what did he die of christ massive heart attack oh wow oh how old 78  completely unexpected or did he have like a history completely unexpected you do realize  this is a comedy show right i realized that but i figured i'd just get it out there before he went  so how's your dad you know you know i do have one fond memory though which was i was doing afternoon 
[01:39:00]  radio in new york ten years ago i don't remember the show and the uh the host got a hold of my parents  phone number and they called up my dad and then they they asked him some questions and they played  um ping pong sound effects and car crashes while he was talking so that's a really fond memory i have of  dad i don't remember who those were but uh hear that oh my god wow this is a new steven it's uh 
[01:39:30]  what did this way what what it's probably just joking hey it's probably the show that's hosted by  the guys with two dead dads yeah you just you joined the club i joined the club it's good to be part of  the club join the club where uh just after it happens when you're you're like is he watching me  i have just discovered that sensation yeah yeah you start well initially it goes away but the initial 
[01:40:00]  thing is like no matter what you're doing it's like is he does he know i'm jerking off to this  i had that exact thought last night oh my god i can't believe you just said that now he knows all  my filthy secrets it does keep you a little more honest you're like no no it doesn't it just makes  you more guilty that you're doing it yeah yeah i used to feel guilty about anything i used to feel  guilty about the songs i would play because you know and now i'm even guiltier about it i figured it  be easier i'd really want to roll her over on her belly but jesus christ so but they're in the ass 
[01:40:30]  and you know what dad's watching i was going to bring him up on stage at carnegie hall which is  like his dream oh i don't think i'm going to do that now no no no that would be still got the  opportunity mom would be a little uncomfortable with is she coming in for wheeling him out yeah  how did you find out did she call you or were you there she called me yeah yeah yeah  that's not a and it was a week ago yeah about a week ago i was supposed to do a show in phoenix  and i landed and i got a message and i called and i never left the airport just 
[01:41:00]  hopped on a plane back to detroit and that is awful yeah sorry to hear brother yes thanks  yeah it's not a good uh good thing to go through whatsoever yeah i remember when i remember when it  happened to you you were on the air when it happened right not well what happened was a week before we  were making our triumphant return to radio right right right he died uh in a car accident it's  like oh that's great timing thanks dad i know right it's it always happens at some monumental 
[01:41:30]  event right because hey carnegie hall this weekend that would have been very exciting for for him and  i'm sure he was very proud of you and your career my dad was very proud of me and my career he was  with me for the two years where we were just suffering and wondering if we were ever going to do radio again  we really thought we were blackballed for most of that time finally no we're going to be all right  and and then boom a week and it happens oh no here's a here's anthony has a better story though uh  i was of course knocking tin um uh in uh the bar after uh a day of uh on the construction site 
[01:42:00]  and my brother joe walks in and he's like hey aunt uh you know dad's dead yeah like ah  shit ah more more drink now at least i'm in the right place right so you know pound him down keep  drinking and then um that was in uh uh january of i believe 95 or something like that or 94 95 i think  because then in april of 95 anthony gets a gig in uh uh boston to do uh radio so that's something he 
[01:42:30]  never got to say so he'll see me he'll see me tooling a girl in the ass and you know jerking off to  inappropriate material but but uh but he doesn't know that you made a no clue that i actually  succeeded nobody's watching you right now so your theories he ain't watching anything when you die  you're dead it's over there nothing that blackness that's how i feel too yeah i mean now i see why  people sort of believe in heaven but i don't believe in you want to think we were talking about it the  other day it's like okay well you'll see him again someday when you die and go to have it's like in 
[01:43:00]  what shape in what form is he going to be like dressed in his clothes did his clothes go to heaven  is he naked that's embarrassing is he with family if if now you you know there's a stepfather that  ever gets involved it's awkward right and we're also saying they say all your family will be up in  heaven we're like what about the cave men that are technically related to us what about and the blobs  of goo that weren't really anything yet do you have to hang out with that shit too yeah what do you 
[01:43:30]  do how do you talk what do you it doesn't make sense he's some guy with eyebrow ridges raping your  grandmother figure well i guess that's the natural order of things she always was a sub  was your dad in bad health or did this just come out of nowhere or no i mean he had had some heart  problems before but yeah he seemed to be fine did he ever have the open heart or any of that no the  bypasses how awful was that flight to detroit or were you just kind of numb uh yeah it was pretty bad 
[01:44:00]  it was a long flight a lot of time to think right now and you realize no one gives a  shit about the the plate you're in they're still like getting pissed at you because you're in their  way or something you would really like the people to kind of like acknowledge that you're having the  worst day of your life right now right but it's the same they don't care about you yeah you realize  that yeah you're all alone in the universe no matter what happens anthony in the end you die in your 
[01:44:30]  own arms uh everyone's saying leo was a great guy and also is it your brother uh andrew's birthday  today yeah it is people know a lot of shit about you i guess so i'd forgotten about that oh  andrew ale on instant feedback that'll be fun for him you know a guy named chris of swick i do  okay yeah he said he's an old high school friend of yours it's true yeah saying leo's a great guy  and it's your brother's birthday today well thank you mom doing all right yep she's cool she's coming  to to new york next week to watch the show right so uh hopefully i'll sell some tickets and people

[01:47:00]  it's like i'm looking around going no he's he's not gonna pop out and go hey anthony come on in or  something like that it's just no he's fucking dead it really sucks keep your new york city  apartment it'll be worth something yeah yeah i guess now would be a bad time to sell it good  investment we talk about how many apartments right now have dead people in them and no one knows yet  how horrible is that i mean this city is ridiculously large and you gotta think yeah i would love to 
[01:47:30]  know maybe the nypd or somebody knows about i i bet you they have that the stats on that yeah about how  how many people are dead television right just waiting for them there waiting for the smell to  be so bad that someone finally calls the authority glazed over eyes watching the tonight show or  something look at us going morbid with steve lynch that's terrible i apologize for setting this tone  now we like uh we do we dip into this area every so often yeah yeah yeah you're gonna record that  whole uh no carnegie hall thing why not i should live from carnegie hall you should do it just i already i 
[01:48:00]  just recorded a couple shows in portland for a new dvd it's a little different when it's carnegie  hall portland carnegie hall what is it you're like wait but hadn't thought of that that's a biggie  what if you wanted someone just to film it so you have it to show people you know look i'd  to prove that i was there no i mean phone yeah yeah maybe i will but i just i want would  carnegie hall have a problem with that if you said look i just want they charge you for everything 
[01:48:30]  even if you don't use no they won't charge you for it but it's if you wanted to use it very  expensive to film that that's yeah that's a biggie but i'm personally using sony hd cameras uh 10 of  them booms uh that's just personally selling them to 20 000 of my closest friends  you like uh being back in michigan i do yeah life is easy there are you in the  good section of michigan because that yeah i'm just north of ann arbor on a lake so it's a real  yeah easy walden like existence yeah is it is it a i mean obviously it is a slower pace but you 
[01:49:00]  enjoy that i love it yeah well i mean i grew up there so i'm used to it yeah this was the culture  shock when i came here and i finally got used to it then i moved back there that's why i couldn't live  in the city i can't do it i need at least long island i gotta get the fuck out of manhattan every  day i'm with you and i live here out of here i so want i love being here yard love it yeah but  you have that lifestyle where you need like i can't walk out of my street and go hey where are 
[01:49:30]  the trannies you can do it no i can't i have to either drive or go to craigslist like every other  good closeted mole but it's like your lifestyle you know you're going to the club it would be a pain  the ass if you were somewhere else and you couldn't go down the cellar and shit like that  but me i cannot fucking hit a tunnel or a bridge quick enough and get the hell off of this  fucking island this rock get me off this rock it's just too uh too just a fake 
[01:50:00]  shit i agree with you bullshit i look forward to the day i get a yard again minorities  oh should i bring that up that's the worst that's the worst i live in the whitey whitiest community  ever you must be like really white whitey white white oh there's militia in my neighborhood of  course there are god damn could i have your uh there's swastikas in the on the uh you know graffiti 
[01:50:30]  and the bowling uh alley that i frequent every night do you have like a penny saver with houses  for sale in your area could you mail that to me i'll get you some info i need that i live in a great  neighborhood i live amongst the jews who are wonderful uh neighbors they're wonderful lawns  they're a wonderful children they're manicured to a teeth and i look like the big on  christmas i'm the only house with lights only house on my block of christmas life hated hey uh  your house do you do it up clark griswold style every year i was actually thinking of having a little 
[01:51:00]  uh nativity scene with a like a please do not kill sign on the jesus just something really  you know make the neighbors chuckle are you getting the big wreath this year oh yeah he gets  the biggest wreath known to fucking man you don't have the baby jesus of the major just giving two  middle fingers to the rest of the neighborhood how big was the wreath it's like nine feet across  it goes over it goes over the big glass window that's over my doors yeah and it's just giant and 
[01:51:30]  there's lights that spiral up these pillars and and it's it's really a so so it's a it's a subtle  fuck you to the jewish people who live in your community i think of it more as a happy holidays  uh for the christian in the neighborhood for the one catholic in the neighborhood and everybody else  you know you pass by and you're like is that a light is oh it's a menorah i think in the window  that are like the curtains just starting on fire it's just there's no festivity to it they really 
[01:52:00]  needed festooned oh i was my next door neighbor went all out uh the new next door neighbor went  all out for halloween though he's got this giant skull on his lawn things about seven or eight feet  high and and the eyes move back and forth the mouth goes blah blah like the zoltar machine it's  frightening but it's kind of cool you know it's nice to see that right although it means more 
[01:52:30]  kids are gonna be knocking on my fucking door hey we got a great candy adam oh look who's there  hi what is sharon doing sharon osborne come in and say hi how are you sharon she's probably got  another show to do where's she going open the door and say hi sharon osborne outside the studio  she's kissing the window she loves jimmy too just tell him to come in and say hi she loves jimmy  norton why is he a fan of ozzy or something no yeah he has turned that fan of ozzy thing 
[01:53:00]  now he's a family member personal relationship no a family member that's what he left the show to  talk to his new mommy yeah they they email each other and call each other and  ozzy loves you come on she and she asked him to personally bring up ozzy at a show  yeah he was yeah if you want oh we should um we should probably play that if uh is she coming  in she personally asked you to bring up ozzy which was amazing and i was saying to steven we should  play for steven probably because it was a big moment for you we haven't seen lynch in a while 
[01:53:30]  look i just want to preface it by saying jimmy please you were you were very excited it's the first  time you're doing something it's your hero coming up and you were very excited and it comes out  like that i was just waiting for me to go oh no it's a good i'm already feeling it it's a good  moment you might want to put your jacket back on it's like it's a good moment like you playing 
[01:54:00]  carnegie hall this is this is terrific this is why i like that she's one of those career moments  for jimmy could i please is she coming in she's i figured i'd do it she said she'd be in town for  a while she wafted that smell wafted in and she smells fantastic see what show is she doing  oh here why isn't she doing our show right now what i think she's waiting to get on the gay channel  right now oh the gay channel why the fuck isn't she on our show for real out cue who  fucking blew this one the gay channel we only i only found out at 3 a.m that the woman was in

[01:58:30]  pay as you exit kids if you came you gotta give me a nickel  that's a good industry to be in as a kid i made a little spending money why the  fuck did i think of that yeah i know right you could have made some money she's so selfish as a  kid you're just thinking i want this for me remember you found one dumb playboy and it was  gold could you imagine making opportunity yeah could have made some cash an entrepreneur yes  and then we're talking about dead people carl in california has this carl  hey guys let me love the show um oh happy birthday to uh steveman's brother and you thank

[02:00:00]  that didn't really and that is a ph on the steve don't yes a lot of people get confused and use the  v you want to take a break and then maybe play a couple songs yeah sure some of the new stuff you  got a new cd out called uh three balloons three balloons and it's available on whatarerecords.com  what does that mean three balloons three balloons yeah um it was inspired by a trip to amsterdam and  i was thinking about bringing some stuff home with me and how i would do that oh how you would mule that 
[02:00:30]  back home all right we got to hear more about that let's take a break and we'll get into that and uh  and steven lynch is going to play for us opie and anthony stay there  catching up with our old friend steven lynch who's going to be playing carnegie hall this weekend  steven lynch.com for ticket info i'm sure uh what what ticket master and all that crap too  carnegie hall box office that's a big gig for steven lynch yep not too much pressure  yeah he's getting a string section together for the big show i am 
[02:01:00]  well all right not a string section a few guys i'm getting a guy on a violin and a guy on a cello  right but they'll be that's a string section i think so they're sectioned off on the stage  they're not in front of you and the new cd's called three balloons you can get that at what  are records.com and it you you found a a fellow fan of uh the first 48 i say yes first 48 uh i like  watching that i watch all the crime shows though yeah uh watch the the old court tv which is true tv now 
[02:01:30]  um i can't i can't help it and first 48 i mean see we're talking it's like it it should be educational to  the criminal if you commit a murder which it's the first 48 hours following a murder that's what  they first 48 is uh you could see what pisses the cops off so if you're a murderer you do that  and what pisses the cops off is when they bring them into the interrogation room and go immediately  i want a lawyer you see the cop pick up the files and go okay he walks out shuts the door looks at the  camera and he's like son of a bitch and it's the other guys that sit there and and the cop starts 
[02:02:00]  just bullshitting him you know we want to we want to do what's right here what's best and we understand  things happen yeah that's what i always say things happen things happen you you seem like a a nice  enough guy and um you know sure the gun went off accidentally could have just gone off accidentally  maybe there was an altercation and where where self-defense was needed right and it's like yeah  i shot him i took the gun i reloaded eight times i killed the whole family i completely falling for 
[02:02:30]  it and then the officer's just like check please okay thank you thank you thank you prison for the  rest of your life my job's done fuck you but but why don't they just lawyer up lawyer the fuck up  every time every time every time well if they did then we wouldn't have 48 i know thank god they  don't lawyer up and they're stupid enough to just babble of it uh about the crime another good show i 
[02:03:00]  just uh noticed um just took note of is that bait car that's on it's called bait car bait car how  many episodes can you possibly do dude it but it's doesn't it get old fast no i cannot get enough of  watching bait car bait car you know what dude you put the bait car on the hook you know what it's  peaceful you're sitting there boom you got your coffee got your car you match the hatch shut up match  the hatchback 
[02:03:30]  i gotta like it there there's nothing to me that's funnier than watching criminals get so caught it's  like cops and candid camera because he there's cameras all over the bait car it's usually a big  escalator something like that and uh they leave it kind of run once they left it running with the  door open it's like this has to be illegal that just doesn't seem to be entrapment i was telling  you yeah i would steal a car if i saw a door open yeah yeah i was telling you it's like a rat trap 
[02:04:00]  yep all set and ready to go so they get in and they they start driving it and they're laughing and  and but they're looking in the mirrors and like look for the man look for the man oh my god oh  we're running low on gas oh shit shit and then they're uh the cops pull out behind them hit a  button the doors lock and the engine dies and that's it and they're trying to get out and it's  so funny watching them trying to get out of the fucking car and it's not moving and then you hear  you know the old all right hands show your hands let me see your hands and then they're like oh 
[02:04:30]  shit now they're trying to make a story up but they've been recorded the entire time they've  been recorded laughing and talking about how they're going to fucking it's the new can of  camera to a chop shop or something and then one guy was being asked by the cops what were you doing  he goes i was driving to the police station to get the reward for the for the car he goes what the  car wasn't stolen until you stole it he goes what record reward he goes well i figured it had been 
[02:05:00]  stolen because the door was open and it was running so i was taken to the police he goes  he goes we were watching you the whole time that's not what you were saying i don't understand how this  is legal i think lynch mentioned it too i don't know how is that legal but it's good it's fun it's  not really a car that was just sitting there i notice you're using sort of an african-american  vernacular as you were doing uh everybody is african-american on every crime show i've ever  watched ever ever ever i don't know what it is i'm not going to even try to figure out if it 
[02:05:30]  is actually well there's 48 sometimes they have the white methods who commit yes yes  everybody uncluck their seatbelts  it sounds like you're put your put your hands up  do they have a laugh track for the show this is officer billy connolly get the  fuck out yeah i guess that's a foreign one no left i don't know yeah no there should be though 
[02:06:00]  that would make it a little better i don't know what the the deal is if it's you know all the crimes  are being committed by minorities or they're uh they're just filming the minorities and editing out  the white people or is that i'm not making judgments here all i'm saying is every single  crime show i watch every single one all right all right occasionally you're right yeah the meth head 
[02:06:30]  the white trash is great when they pull up to a concert plenty of yeah yeah cops i'm not even  talking about cops cops is very very diverse yes um if it's a stabbing you know it's a hispanic  if it's a shooting you know it's black and if it's domestic violence that mullet toothless white  motherfucker with no shirt is coming out with a beer in his hand and a cigarette he's the one that  called the cops and he's the one going to jail it's classic but first 48 is a microcosm of our society 
[02:07:00]  yes it is cops is very very diverse yeah but um big car and not so much uh and first 48 not so much  a lot of times they're talking to you know well we tried to track down a gentleman called cheeseburger  and uh and they put cheeseburger in the computer and there's his picture it's like a cheeseburger  and they know who it is they know his name they know everything about it danny can you go back  because the guy goes we're in a stolen car you fucking asshole or something like that 
[02:07:30]  yeah because i think he asked the question like why are they just stole this fucking vehicle dude  like literally we just stole it with your eyes off the cops tell me if you see any  i will you better burn this thing or something burn it we're in touch  you're in touch  the big cars being driven in circles in an open field  oh they're doing donuts  oh 
[02:08:00]  this is so dumb  i'm going to put myself at risk this much  me neither buddy  that's the best i go to jail  i'd fucking smash the top of the head with this bottle right now  no fucking questions  let's see  i'll do some hardcore shit  you can crash through the fucking tree  yeah you're not fucking right if you have to  i gotta keep up  go ahead and fucking do it  go ahead and fucking do it  i'm ready to fucking run and get the fuck out of here 
[02:08:30]  you don't be a cop  pray it's not a cop  pray just pray  that's right  yeah god  pray  just pray  just pray  just pray  just pray  pray  we'll hit him in the head with the bottle 
[02:09:00]  fuck it's a cop buddy  it's a cop  please don't come down here  oh he's coming man  he's coming  we're so busted  we're so busted  we're so busted  we're so busted  he's following a big time 
[02:09:30]  why didn't we just ditch it at the base  obviously it's the only way to go  i went to a house  we should run  okay which one  which one  one  which one  i don't know  i think it's three  oh  fuck  the engine on the big car is the same  with my boss 
[02:10:00]  we're fucking brothers  run  run  what did they say about the 21 year old  they found him in a shed  yeah in this case they were able to run they didn't lock the doors  they said the 19 year old was  yeah  the 19 year old was caught immediately and the 21 year old was found by police dogs hiding in a shed  we're so  run  we're so busted  pray  pray  that's big car  on youtube 
[02:10:30]  that's the time to pray  after committing a crime  he's gonna  he's gonna bust that fucking cop in the face with a bottle man  oh no  he's ready to cry  oh pray  pray  pray  pray  you know i want to be in uh total compliance  and i forgot my tags  the leonard skinner's playing right outside the building  what  i heard them tuning up when they were coming in  i didn't know who it was  it's almost leonard skinner  oh that's on the corner uh there  it's literally where we work at 
[02:11:00]  we pull  what  we drive right by there every morning  work  what's that  we are at sixth avenue and  there's no one there to see leonard skinner  well that's probably for fox  yeah but there's nobody there  look  they didn't know  it's because they're doing something off their new album  thank you  we talk about that all the time  that place would be packed  there's no one there  maybe they will  yeah that's where  that's 49th street  that's 48th street  the crowd  it's 48th and uh what  and 6th  6th avenue  right outside  there's a lot of people right there 
[02:11:30]  no it's not  they're kind of  oh they're cheating  yeah they're cheating big time  well they probably just started  they didn't know  i heard them make a music  make a note  i said what is that  now what are they going to do  freeberg  no  oh the report is going to go up now  and go  hey you are just so exciting  there's about 20 people there  you don't think it's a big crowd out  no  because they stop to pan  that's never good  when they pull back and then stop  my favorite shot is when they pan the front of the crowd  crowd  you know it's only three people deep 
[02:12:00]  and they do it real fast  yeah  and it's a short  it's a short  it's very short and fast  wow look at all  well there's no one there  all right  i feel like something's not right in the universe  when i'm playing carnegie hall  and skinnerd is outside of fox news  well you're  what happened  what happened in the world  because you're still the original member of stephen lynch  that is true  when you move on  and there's another stephen lynch  when i die  my brother  right  yeah  all on gallagher  gallagher too 
[02:12:30]  then you're gonna see the numbers drop a little bit  but until then you play carnegie hall my friend  and have fun doing it  all right i will  i promise  why don't we uh get a song out of lynch  sure  how do we do this  you need your uh  guitar mic  i don't think so probably  it'll work  you said old school  old school  is this off the new cd three balloons  no it's not actually  all right  three left balloons  three left balloons  i think um  i think last time i was here with you guys  i played you some songs  that i had transposed from a big book of  these really wonderful diaries 
[02:13:00]  that i had been reading  oh  and uh  i went back to that book  and uh  found a couple more  that i just thought were really beautifully written  hmm this is one of  dear diary  today was a good day  i'm a girl  who sings with soul  i'm writing songs  and making records  i feel my life 
[02:13:30]  is finally whole  i'll outsell  whitney and janet  celine and madonna  i feel a big hit coming  rihanna  which i think that's lovely  because it's nice  she's um  she's um  she's got beat up  she's gonna write a big hit  that's wonderful  she meant by that  i'm not really sure  exactly  very good  i want  i really wanted to do one  i thought the greatest diary of them all 
[02:14:00]  would be  i can't  i can't figure out how to rhyme  mckenzie phillips  but i think that would be  oh yeah  that is a good  how do you get better than  me and dad  finally connecting again  yes  yes  the closest i came was  he would like softly caress my  track mark arm  my coke nose  and my pill lips  but that  it's just  too much of a  I kind of like it though  my pill lips  i think that was pretty bad  or maybe it's to be written from bijou's perspective 
[02:14:30]  you know  she's jealous of her sisters  well she doesn't really want to acknowledge  how about  i can't think of a good rhyme  so i'd suck my father's dick  on a set of one day at a time  hold on  let me write that down  let's just write that down  bijou phillips auditioned for uh  the wedding singer  really  to be the female lead  yeah  ugh  yuck  she was in rough shape that day  was she  yeah  which sort of  made it  made it a little hot  a little hotter  when you be in rough  shape if you had that secret  i guess so 
[02:15:00]  yeah  you know what  molly ringwald did too  which is  i had to sing with her  which is really  really strange  i hear she  they just paraded in  all these sort of  people  and  what's that  i heard she sings well  she does sing well  yeah  but uh  not that type of music  no  no  and i was just staring at her  going  it's fucking claire  how do i  i can't  i can't even do my lines  i'm looking at  fucking claire  oh yeah  who else was there  um 
[02:15:30]  bijou phillips  molly ringwald  oh debbie gibson  debbie gibson  i'm sorry  deborah gibson  don't call her  debbie anymore  she was a little abrasive  was she  just loud  and  big  oh  amy adams  who  you guys know who amy adams  is redhead  from  doubt  and  yeah  that was a good movie  yeah she was fantastic  i liked her  that was my  she got my vote  who finally got it  uh  this woman  laura benanti  who's a big broadway star  and tony award winner 
[02:16:00]  well of course  but  it just didn't work out for us  according to the reviews  oh shit  we didn't quite have that uh  chemistry  i guess  fucking the guy from  the new york times  reviewed the show  ben bradley  or whatever his name is  yeah  and he  son of a bitch  he said that i  he said i was good  in some parts  and in other parts  i reminded him of  ryan seacrest  what  i wanted to  punch him  in his fucking  cock filled mouth  so badly  you know  ryan seacrest  and some guy in new jersey 
[02:16:30]  said i had the stage presence  of a turnip  which i thought was really  nice  turnips are actually  notoriously  as far as a grown  vegetable is concerned  turnips are second  only to carrots  in a magnetism  and stage presence  how could someone say that  if you  like started the show  and put a turnip  on the stage  yeah  someone would notice  there was a problem  i would think so  i would think  and then you know  steven's on stage  then you know  you hear him singing  and and you hear music  that's actually  it's not a turnip 
[02:17:00]  it's a compliment  have you ever seen  a turnip on stage  you can't take  your eyes off  it would be  all you talked about  all right  i take it back  it would be all you  talked about  when you went home  i went to see  the wedding singer  do you know  they had a turnip  on the stage  the whole time  quite a scene stealer  well i enjoyed  the guy  we thought  and everyone  we sent there  loved the damn show  man  sent a lot of people  in my family  they fucking loved it  it was what it was 
[02:17:30]  it was a fun little show  all of my raw foodist  friends enjoyed the show  you were sick of doing  18 shows a week  anyway  i'm just picturing  a turnip  in you know  shakespearean  garb  how many shows  how many shows  did that last  uh it was nine months  i have no idea  that's a good  fucking line  for broadway  it was pretty good  it was pretty good  you got another  song for us there  steven  but while uh  hold on  but while mr lynch  is charming  as robbie  in an angry  or depressed mood  he does especially 
[02:18:00]  well by the two  oddball songs  retained from the  movie written by  mr sandler  with mr hurley  he is more often  called upon to be  appealingly boyish  bringing to mind  a less vain  less glib  ryan seacrest  just hearing it again  is making my  fucking blood boil  right now  fuck his asshole  let me tell you  something  that's not a slam  i'm telling you  you're less vain  and less glib  it's not  he doesn't love it 
[02:18:30]  but he's not  shitting on you  there's no way  you can compare  anyone to ryan  seacrest and take  it as a compliment  um  no  because he's saying  that like he likes  it's not like he's  saying your singing  isn't good  i'm telling you  unless there's other  stuff he said  that might be  annoying but that's  not like a crucifixion  or something  i'm telling you  because critics i  fucking hate  oh that's true  and that's not a  massacre at all  no  i mean i'd rather  be a less vain  and less glib  laurence olivier  yeah  or you know  sean penn or  something  you're a  more humorous  but slightly 
[02:19:00]  dirtier  aunt  how would you  like that  meaning you  i would take it  as a complete  insult  oh  oh  well yes  fucking  stop  it's annoying  but i'm saying  i don't think  you say that  to kill him  because he  would have  said he  arrived  no it wasn't  a slam  it was just  a sort of  annoying  comparison  take that  paper and put  it on the  bottom of the  birdcage  that's right  that's right  and frame it  he is not  invited to my  carnegay hall  show  no  carnegay hall  that's saturday 
[02:19:30]  no  friday night  friday night  no it's saturday  i'm gonna come  back for that  i actually leave  buffalo saturday  morning so i can  come back for that  oh  really  yeah  friday night i do  two shows  first one's sold  out  second one's  not quite yet  at the town  ballroom  but uh yeah  actually we'll be  back in town for  that  let's go  yes  love to have  you  love to have  you guys  field trip  love to watch  my friend work  in carnegay hall  while i'm off  got two big  shows in buffalo  yeah  yeah  you're doing  all right  he's got his

[02:38:00]  I say  well he was at  Comic Con  or Comic Con  how do you say it  well this was  the Big Apple Con  the Big Apple Con  the Big Apple Con  but technically  it's Comic Con  Comic Con  and you took  E-Rock  to help you  with some  celebrity interviews  throughout the week  Steve kept mentioning  to bosses  and stuff  that Sam and Eric  were going to  Comic Con  which I  took umbrage with  because I knew  going into this thing  that I would be going 
[02:38:30]  to do interviews  and stuff  and Eric would just  be distracted  by the goodies  the whole time  by the goodies  what kind of goodies  did he get all  distracted  well  what kind of  horrible stuff  did he get  at this thing  well there's  everything  you can get  everything  this was a  giant Comic Con  and Eric kept  getting distracted  in the toy sections  can we get  E-Rock in here  please  I went with Jess  I don't know  can we  how big's the door  Jesus  I went with Jess  in the morning  before Eric  got there  and apparently  Jess had to go  do something 
[02:39:00]  ah  and then Eric  had to come in  and fill in  for her  oh but you're not  suggesting  that you spend  the rest of the  afternoon  with his  fiance  well I'm not  not my fiance  just long term  what  I thought  you guys  were getting married  if you do a little  investigating  you can see  exactly what she  was doing  Saturday night  oh shit  she might be  in one of my  videos  really  if you look  closely  didn't realize  she was a  hockey fan  oh shit  yo  I know you're  not so I  invited her 
[02:39:30]  apparently she's  more of a  hockey fan than  Comic Con  by day  and Jersey  All Pro  wrestling by  night  yeah  I would say  the fucking  listeners man  they pick up  on everything  somebody picked  up on the fact  that she was  in one of the  videos really  quickly  I don't even  know what she  looks like  I don't know  I really don't  know  E-Rock  hello  you were  distracted by  the shiny  toys  yeah  how many times  did I have to  yell at you  Eric we're  going come on  Eric we're  here to work  we're here to  work  it was during  the down time  when you weren't  interviewing anybody  so I was like  oh let me just  look right here 
[02:40:00]  what toys did you  see that you liked  there was a lot of  them  tell me one or two  tell me which  he-man character  were you looking  for  I bought  Skeletor  no no no no  who's the less  known character  that you were  looking for  oh yeah  Mossman  what is  fucking Mossman  it's part of  the masters  of the universe  wait that's  distracting  that is amazing  that people  were able to  figure that out  there's your  there's like  four pictures  of her online  how do they  know what she  looks like  there's a girl 
[02:40:30]  in one of my  videos  that's her right  there  why was she  with you  with a hockey  game  she didn't  want to go  to wrestling  after comic-con  so she left  comic-con early  and said she's  going to the  mall in long  island and an  islanders game  which she's never  watched a hockey  game in 15 years  but how is she  what it was a  coincidentally enough  that she's right  next to  yes  coincidentally  she was sitting  next to him  and went to the  mall with him  yes coincidentally  and he drove  her  coincidentally  wait where  was your wife 
[02:41:00]  was she there  yeah she's there  oh really  he's got one  of those things  going on  apparently  wow  didn't know  how this  at one point  it was you  know two  pairs  and then all  of a sudden  it's just  I know you  don't like  sports so I  saved you the  trouble  oh great  you and  Iraq hate  sports  I was doing  work for  actually this  show that  you're the  host of  while you  decided to  hit up the  mall in the  islanders game  with my lady  wow  I thought you  were kidding 
[02:41:30]  until I saw  the video  no  no  and how did  people feel  oh look at  where poor Sam is  how did you get  a picture of  old Opie  no that's  Lex Luger  the total package  oh that's  exactly  the total package  yes  we were talking  sports and  Iraq came in  this morning  and he goes  oh sports  great  and then walked  out  you don't like  sports at all  I like hockey  now and then  but that's  about it  no Angela  she got me  into it  your girl  loves hockey  if it wasn't for that  I'd not be into any sports  she's a big hockey fan 
[02:42:00]  Eric used to be a Mets fan  and that went away  went away  was she happy  you got Mossman  was she psyched  oh yeah  get back to that  because we were  looking at the video  we were distracted  so what  he bought the toy  Mossman  what's Mossman  come on Eric  we're going  we're here to work  let's do some interviews  and he was never  behind me  because he was  at the toy area  the toy booth  buying Mossman  how big was the  Mossman you bought  he's small  how much  about 4 inches  oh  10 bucks  where are you going  to put it  with the rest  of my collection  which is where 
[02:42:30]  collection  I know where it  should be  in the big green  storage thing  behind the apartment  complex  you got just  shitty toys  all over your  apartment  shitty toys  that's true  they're not  shitty toys  of course they are  Jesus  most of them  are in storage  but they're  the ones that I  have aren't shitty  you're a hoarder  they're stuff I had  from when I was a kid  I just never  what's your prize  possession  and then we'll  decide if it's  shitty or not  what's the best  I'll give you a chance  what's the one  thing you can't  you can't  lose  wait 
[02:43:00]  we'll get rid  that's the formula  it works  that's the formula  it works  what's the one  thing  that you lost  this  it's not really  a toy  it's a  big hand autograph  thing from Matt  Groening from  the Simpsons  he was upset  that's pretty cool  he was upset  because he went  to  he went to one 
[02:43:30]  of the toy booths  and he was upset  because the Ned  Flanders action figure  that he wanted  was too expensive  how much was it  they wanted 25 bucks  but it's all bent up  and everything  I wasn't going to  pay for that  where do you put  these things  all over your  bedroom and stuff  no the Simpsons  they're in the  bathtub with them  no the Simpsons  stuff is hanging  on a wall  in one of the  rooms in my apartment  the Simpsons  stuff is cool  I have four rooms  Big Kev's online  how do we get  the Big Kev  Big Kev 
[02:44:00]  what's up buddy  I heard something  about shitty toys  all over an apartment  oh I'm sorry  biggity better call  hi Big Kev  I thought maybe  you were talking  about me  I just don't  understand that  culture to be  honest with you  I know you don't  I know it's huge  I know I know  I know these things  do very well  but I just can't  be bothered  just like E-Rock  can't be bothered  with sports  even though he was  at the Yankee game  over the weekend  I was offered  a ticket to go  I can't understand  being a Mets  or an Islanders 
[02:44:30]  fan  at this point  Kev I can't  understand it myself  so there we go  yeah  yeah I know  I respect it  I respect it  in somewhat  did Ant talk about  him holding  some very expensive  comic books  while he was there  oh my goodness  what did you hold  did I hold  some expensive  fucking comic books  we went to a  comic book  booth  there  and wow  these guys are  back there  with suits on  and everything  they're exclusive  dealers  yes yes 
[02:45:00]  and what were  some of the  amazing comics  that I was showing  I gave Anthony  a detective comics  number 27  which is the first  appearance of Batman  first appearance  of Batman  so  this  no can I  I have to say  I'm not even  trying to make jokes  so  yeah yeah  so until you  ask the price  how much would you  assume  alright  how much would you  assume  that that would  go for  what was inflation  it was 10 cents  when it was bought 
[02:45:30]  it was inflation  $5.75  $5.75  let me guess  Jimmy's gonna guess  I have a question  what kind of condition  was it in  it was a 4.5  Jimmy  that's mint  4.5 out of 10  ok no I don't know  I don't know a point  I know mint  near mint  so it's like  good  did I consider it good  that's the cover  slightly above  but yeah  and it was a restored copy  which means what  which means that  professional people  had done some  restoration work  on mostly the cover  and perhaps a few pages 
[02:46:00]  on the inside  ok so it's doctored  doctored  well we prefer  restored  I would say  to play conservative  $4,827,000  it might as well have been  no I'm gonna guess  say $15,000  ok it was $45,000  $45,000  wow  for what  what  like what do you do with it  well I put it in my  dent  yeah you could do that 
[02:46:30]  no I did not buy it  what was it being stored in  I would put it in one of my  bathrooms  yeah put it in the shitter  put it on the shitter  Jimmy what'd you say  what was it being stored in  not just a plastic  fucking bag  no it's in a  it's what we refer to  as a comic coffin  it's a plastic case  that is not intended  to be opened  it can be opened  but it's not intended  to be opened  it's hard plastic  right  and if you shake it around  will the magazine shake  or is it  absolutely not  wait so you can't even 
[02:47:00]  read it  no it's not for reading  Obi at this point  at this point  Obi there have been  so many reprints  of that story  you could easily  find one  yeah  but if I'm spending  $45,000  I want to read  that copy  no  like I said  you could open it  you could leaf through it  but you run the risk  of your $45,000 comic  becoming $38,000  would it make you  really nervous  if I was eating it  while I was having  salsa and chips  and drinking coffee 
[02:47:30]  if it was mine  it wouldn't be  anywhere near you  you just lift your mind  eating over it  just like  chips and salsa  you're flipping pages  oops  you flip a page  too fast  it rips  you're like  oops  well what are you  going to do  Ant also had  a Superman  number one  in his hands  wow  I'm going to guess  let me guess  on that one  now what  what kind of condition  that was a little  bit better  Jimmy  like a six  yeah  probably more like 
[02:48:00]  a five five  maybe a six  can I guess  $60,000  uh yes  but you'd be wrong  it was only  $43,000  $43,000  $43,000  well it was obviously  it was going to be  about the same price  if it's the first time  Superman  appeared in the first time  no sir  it's the first issue  of Superman  in his own magazine  Superman originally  appeared in  Action Comic  yes  that would have been  even more expensive  how much is that one  it would depend  on condition  Jimmy  and I would say  your guess  $60,000 would probably 
[02:48:30]  go for one  that was about  a three or a four  now Kev  what's the most  valuable thing  you own  the most valuable  thing I own  uh I don't know  what's the most  expensive comic  I don't know  how about  give us one  one thing that  you know  if there was a fire  you'd run in  and make sure  you grab it  if there was a fire  I'd burn up  whatever was burning  on the stove  get it  what  it said  if there was a fire  in my house  I'd probably die  trying to put it out  all right  oh 
[02:49:00]  I have  I have a lot  of original art  yeah  um  and that  that  that is  to me  that is  what is  the most expensive  now the  uh  the R2D2  that was there  was amazing  the little kid on it  dressed as a little Jedi  yeah  um  and he was riding  a little dork  it was  it was  a real size  you know  it was  like it was  from the movie  it was better  than the prop  they used in the movie  it was better  than all of them  they've used  for the movies  yeah  quite amazing  all radio controlled 
[02:49:30]  were you impressed  by anything there  over the weekend  I was impressed by that  yeah  I was impressed by that  I was impressed by the fact  that William Shatner  was gone in less than an hour  and I saw him on Sunday  oh did ya  yes  was he miserable  he was there for slightly  less than an hour  was he totally miserable  with his $80 pictures  yeah it was  uh  there wasn't a lot of people  online  which is very surprising  really  yeah  well  at 80 bucks a clip  uh huh  he's not the most expensive  and you think he would be  who would be 
[02:50:00]  Mark Hamill  really  at 150 a pop  last I heard  wow  that's stupid  I know  people pay it  who cares he's Luke Skywalker  Captain fucking Kirk  do you get a picture with that too  or is that extra  no you get a picture with that  oh okay  alright Kev  we gotta get to these interviews  okay  one more question for Kev  what's the most expensive comic Kev  is it action number one  I would say  on a guess  I would say probably yeah  but how much is a mint condition of that  I have never  I don't think one  I don't think there's a known mint copy

[02:51:30]  in Jersey  it would rain  and they would come up  from the basement  we lived on the second floor  and I'd have three or four of those  on my bedroom wall  at a time  were you on paper street  come on  no  who's that  oh you didn't see Fight Club  I did see it  oh okay  sorry  oh yeah he was beating himself up  and the basement was flooded  you know  you didn't like Fight Club  I liked it  I loved it  I didn't love it  book's better  no the movie's great  book's better  movie's great  book's better  book's better  book's better  don't fight 
[02:52:00]  plus one  book's better  fuck  guys don't fight  what's the haps  at the Big Apple Comic Con  yeah  where E-Rock did not help you at all  because he was looking at all the toys  no  Jess was a huge help  and then E-Rock came  and slowed the process down entirely  E-Rock's just a big sweet kid  he is  he's like a retard  at those places  he loves the shiny things  he was very  I forgot to tell you  he was very upset  that uh  he found  the Transformers toy  that he had been searching for  oh 
[02:52:30]  in the box  it was shiny  and came with  I think  two cassette tapes  wow  but uh  four cassette tapes  but it cost a hundred dollars  and little E-Rock  had ran out of pocket money  by the time we got there  E-Rock  he ran out of pocket money  pocket money  fucking E-Rock  he ran out of pocket money  because he got pictures  with too many of his favorite celebrities  oh  does that make me happy  who'd he get pictures with  that makes me so happy  I got uh  photos with uh  the Duke boys  Tom Boat and George Snyder 
[02:53:00]  he started too  if we're there  but they wouldn't let you  take them together  of course not  why  because you gotta pay  for each one separately  you had to go  you had to go to a certain time  and pay a certain company  to get the combo pick  if you went straight to their booth  you couldn't  enough  enough already  yes Daniel  it was uh  it was like 85 dollars  just to get both of them  and a photo together  and you don't get to take the photo  they just print it out  and you don't get a digital copy  or anything  combo people are the worst  it is the biggest ripoff  on the face of the earth 
[02:53:30]  why  I went to Monster Mania  a few years back  when they were doing the big  I can't believe you guys  didn't talk about this on the show  because they did the big  They Live reunion  oh  wow  you're kidding me  Rowdy Roddy  yeah  and fucking uh  the black guy  the black guy  from Platoon  well anyway  so  you buy your 8x10  let's say with Roddy Piper first  so it's 20 bucks  for the 8x10  20 bucks for the autograph  so now you bring that 8x10  over to  black guy from They Live  now you figure  alright well he's just gonna charge me 20  for the autograph 
[02:54:00]  no  he charges you another 20  because you brought your own item  for him to sign  oh yeah they do that too  go fuck yourselves  and they also like  if you do a combo picture  with two people  enough already  you gotta pay  it's one picture  I understand  but you still have to pay for two  dude I understand to a point  like these guys want to make a little money  and they're not doing that well  but that's just fucking ripping off  your own fans  it used to be  it's disgusting  it used to be look  you appreciated an actor  or sports star  whatever the fuck he is  for his work  you were a fan of his work  and in exchange for that loyalty 
[02:54:30]  he or she would give you  an autograph or a picture  right  it was a little trade off  for your loyalty  and fandom  and it's turned into this thing  where  now they charge outlandish prices  trying to make a buck  for these fucking autographs  that you're not gonna be able to sell  for more money  sorry  it just ain't gonna happen  you gotta just  it's like you gotta go to a place  where  it's like you get ripped off  you just  I mean there's gotta be like  better companies 
[02:55:00]  that have  like celebrities come in  I can't think of one  and um  get the picture taken  I can't think of  a company  yeah  yeah  I don't really know  where you get the best celebrities  I don't know  oh really  I wonder  would it be an emporium  I don't know  you know it's funny  you should ask that  oh  there's an emporium  yes  what kind of emporium  Ted's famous  people photograph emporium  oh  you're the name  I can get him  yeah Ted  yes  like who 
[02:55:30]  who do you want  I have Trevor Burbick  Trevor Burbick  Trevor Burbick  wow  what about Babe Ruth  that's a biggie  he's dead Gregory  it's only living people  who will come in  and you can take photographs  with them  alright let's say  I want  combinations  whatever you need  I want an A-list star  I want  Tom Cruise  he's not available  why is he available  he's busy shooting a movie  well  but that's just it  you being the company 
[02:56:00]  you're supposed to find out  no we don't  but from Jerry Maguire  we have the lady  who played one of the  secretaries of the opening scene  when he's walking through  saying hello  she was hello number four  that isn't even  that isn't even  off track  of what these  fucking conventions  are by the way  Helen Crumplimkin  Helen Crumplimkin  dude  that's exactly  what these things are  I know  you're not even  90% of the people  there are like  you know  person number 8  yes she'll wave 
[02:56:30]  at a picture  of Tom Cruise  like she did  in the movie  that picture  is $722  shipping costs  who  who are some of the  celebrities that had  no line  well  Brandi Roderick  Brandi Roderick  I think that's her name  from Celebrity Apprentice  she was the hot blonde  right from Playboy  no one was online  to get her autograph  I was there for like  four hours back and forth  and I never saw  oh my god  how embarrassing  Mickey Dolenz  had a surprisingly short line  because he's usually  most of his fans 
[02:57:00]  are dead by now  he had a whole  fucking bunch of  like monkeys  drum heads up there  that were signed  and drumsticks  the problem  the problem with  Mickey Dolenz  and a lot of those guys  fall into this problem  he used to have  a long line  but he's at every  convention on the  east coast  so no one gives a  flying fuck  everybody's already  got Mickey Dolenz  they got it  they have already  don't need it  who else  Virgil  no line  Virgil again  Virgil was there again  he's a wrestling  superstar  is this the latest  Virgil  yes  million dollar man 
[02:57:30]  Ted DiBiase  and Virgil  well no  Ted DiBiase  did not show up  yeah  they advertised  he was coming  but he was never  booked to be there  and he's got one  banner  that just says  yes  if it sounds like  E-Rock's pissed off  it's because he had  his million dollar  championship belt  ready to get signed  by Ted DiBiase  oh the million dollar  man signing the  million dollar belt  Jesus Christ  he wasn't going to be there  he was going to bring it there  I was going to  he had it in the office  I didn't know  I didn't know  Black Earl was Virgil  no that's Virgil 
[02:58:00]  it's a different guy  oh I know  are the pictures  of empty lines  no  all alone again  it's the only one  E-Rock took  um  you know who else  had nobody  in front of him  who  fucking the kid  from Terminator  there  Eddie Furlong  yeah  he had that long line  though  did he  yeah  you mean the kid  from Pet Sematary 2  yeah  that kid  when I walked by  there was no one  online  really  yeah you sure  it wasn't for  Linda Hamilton  she was right next to him  I thought it was  the line was  for both of them 
[02:58:30]  I don't know  maybe a double  you're saying a double  maybe a combo type deal  no combo shot  stop it  um  I just want to jump in here  Dave from Hate Speech Radio  just as an example  of people who care about  their fans  Brie Olsen signed  an autograph for me  for five dollars  and I got to feel her tits  wow  there you go  she's a good girl  Eric started flipping  the hell out  because we passed  some  Battlestar Galactica  cast members  no way  previous or  new 
[02:59:00]  Battlestar Galactica  oh okay  there were two  because I saw  yeah  there were  Boomer  from the old series  Boomer  never saw the old series  yeah  from the old  Battlestar Galactica  and what's her name  there  was also there  from Buck Rogers  and the guy  from Buck Rogers  Aaron Green  yeah  who's the guy  that played Buck Rogers  in Buck Rogers  I don't know his name  but he's there  John Wayne  no  hold on  it'll probably pop up here  Gil Gerard  thank you  oh Gil Gerard  thank you  Gil Gerard was sitting there 
[02:59:30]  no line  looking like Gil Gerard's  great grandfather  and he was shoving food  in his mouth  out of this little  styrofoam thing  you don't want to see  these guys like that  and I looked just going  like oh  is that him sweating  yeah  oh yeah  that's Gil Gerard  that's Buck Rogers  where are these pictures  they're all over  I mean there's one  the one Virgil picture  is on E-Rock's Twitter  but other than that  yeah this was just  Google Images  alright just Google it  yeah Tom Wopat 
[03:00:00]  when I went  had no lines  he was just surfing  on his laptop  embarrassing  that's humiliating  because the line  was all next to  John Snyder  it's very  yeah  John Snyder  because John Snyder's  got like fucking  Smallville people  and shit like that  and then what does  Tom Wopat have  oh I did the revival  of fucking some  shitty show on Broadway  he's got a lot of  things going on  he's in a jazz trio  I'll stop it Sam  Ernie Hudson  didn't have any line  when I passed him  well I saw him  going to the  concession stand  with his  who you're gonna call 
[03:00:30]  and on the back  it said Ghostbusters  and then when he  got behind the counter  he would put back  on his jumpsuit  and smile  and shuck and jive  a little bit  you know what I'd like  to do to Ernie Hudson  I could just drop  honey jars  in front of his feet  and have him  throw bees on me  I'm gonna hurt you Red  the Batmobile  and the  what's it called  the DeLorean  both had longer lines  than any of the people  we've mentioned  and I was upset  with the DeLorean  because you don't 
[03:01:00]  fucking pimp out  the DeLorean  by putting television  screens in the grill  in the license plates  and in the fucking  license plates  and in the doors  like that  just stop it  the flux capacitor  looked good  it was fluxing  the equipment  looked good on it  but why would they  ruin it  by putting television  screens  Eric also  he turned to me  while we were  walking at one point  he turned around  and said  I'm tired  my legs hurt  yeah I'm hungry  that's shiny  I want it  but I have no 
[03:01:30]  pocket money  I've run out  of pocket money  but I'd really like  my Transformers  why do you run  out of pocket money  I love it's pocket money  he's run out of pocket  no  why would you bring  more pocket money  did he ask to borrow  six pence  yeah  he brought a lot  of pocket money  but so many of his  favorite stars  and so many goodies  were there  he didn't know  how to ration it  properly  he didn't have any  control  he didn't have any  willy nilly  instead of trying  to figure it out  I couldn't spend  three bucks there  if I was told to 
[03:02:00]  I could go through  a lot of money  if I was told to  I couldn't spend  three dollars  I spent twenty dollars  why  I took a photo  with Bruno Sammartino  Bruno was there  yes  I would like to see Bruno  now you got me a little bit  yes  he's old school  he hates Vince McMahon  and everybody  he hates him  he won't even get into  he won't  he won't accept  nomination into the  WWE Hall of Fame  why does he hate him  he doesn't like  Vince McMahon  he doesn't  I don't know  they left on terrible terms  I'm starting to think  his own son  doesn't like Vince McMahon 
[03:02:30]  David  I doubt he does  Shane quit  Shane  what's that about  he retired  Shane McMahon resigned  from the WWE  really  he's younger than us  what is he doing  retiring  he said being 40 years old  he has decided  that he wants to pursue  other things  he's thanked everybody  he's had a great time  he said it's time now  to move on  yeah really  time to give up  the million dollar job he had  maybe he's gonna help  I think he's had it  with dear old dad  he's sick of just doing that  his whole life  has been about men in tights 
[03:03:00]  yeah but hey  is the rankler  gonna beat up  on the toadstooler  hey how about  how about the jogger  hits the hat mongler  with the chair  shut up  his whole fucking life  has been that nonsense  I don't know if that's all  but he's in line  to take over  this billion dollar company  he's 40 years old  and his father's like  get in there  and take some bumps  I mean he probably  left at the right time  because it looks more  like Triple H  and Stephanie 
[03:03:30]  will be taking over  the reins of that  he got forced out  I think he got pushed out  I was smart  I'm smart  he's sitting in the chair  got passed over  oh god  Jesus Christ  who's that old wrestler  old bumpy tits  McGillicuddy  I should have pointed it out  I love that wrestler  bumpy tits  McGillicuddy  hey Eric  oh go ahead  we're gonna get into

[03:13:30]  he was good  and he does his best here  to say  not to say anything  negative about anything  yes  nothing  alright so we're here  with Tom Wopat  at Comic Con  or Big Apple Con  Tom what's the haps  well you know  just hanging out  Schneider's not here  right this second  but he's been over here  next to me  that's always fun  so it's the original  Dukes of Hazzard reunion  can you pause that for a second  follow up question  what's fun about it  why is that so fun  give me a half a reason 
[03:14:00]  that's fun  god this is gonna suck  for these guys  he just doesn't want to  burn one bridge  does he  nothing negative  about anyone  anything  any concepts  any belief  nothing  that's always fun  sitting down  having like one or two  people dribble past me  so I could sign something  because I was famous  40 years ago  I'm playing with my laptop  trying not to make eye contact  with the people  who walk by my booth  yeah  how humiliating  that's not what they're doing  it's all  I was thinking  was how humiliating 
[03:14:30]  this is  for 90%  of the people  that were there  you're like a line cuckold  yeah  just watching other men  with bigger lines  that's like  oh god look  oh that guy  don't look  I don't want to look  you're sitting there  and saying  would you like to pay money  to meet me  and everybody walking past you  saying no thank you  I would not want to  that's not an engaging proposition  at all  no  they have to put their names up  and what they're from  yeah  and pictures of them  from 30 years ago  yeah from 30 years ago  there's pictures of them  and it's like  oh I remember  oh yeah 
[03:15:00]  and they all say  oh yeah I've moved on  from that  but that seems like  they're signing pictures  from that  all they're signing  are pictures from like  Battlestar Galactica  did we try to talk to  Lou Ferrigno on the phone  yes  I knew Mardi Gras  but he had a problem  with his phone  it was hooked to his ear  we were on a balcony  drunk  with more noise  than we could deal with  they book an interview  with Lou Ferrigno  while we're in the middle  of fucking Mardi Gras  that makes sense  we can't hear  well of course  yes  you know  exactly with him  you gotta get up 
[03:15:30]  in a library  and scream into a megaphone  old fucking  Jesus  old fucking  old jelly bean ears  he might as well  you know  he might as well  just have  a fucking  a bushel of jelly beans  hanging off the side  of his head  for as well as  those ears pick up sound  just a bushel  of jelly beans  he can't hear  but his ears  are delicious  I like your  quiet place reference  so Tom Wolpat 
[03:16:00]  just doesn't want  to be negative  so it's the  original  Dukes of Hazzard  reunion  are you happy  to see your  former co-star  again  oh sure  it's always a pleasure  we actually did  a thing down  in Kentucky  like about  three weeks ago  actually I'm gonna  blow pretty quick  I got a gig  I'm playing a couple  of concerts  out on Long Island  pause real quick  I have a question  follow up question  after we did a thing  in Kentucky  what was the thing  follow up question  A what was the thing 
[03:16:30]  and B  that's interesting  how  a thing in Kentucky  you didn't know  that could have  been too good  and all these guys  are just hoping  to make it again  he's got a convention  circuit in Kentucky  and he's got a couple  what  concerts  and he's got gigs  out on Long Island  why is he playing  I wasn't going to  ask him about it  why  then we could  openly laugh  because  the person  who was before me  there's one  autograph before me  so he's like  hang on  let me just sign  this  I was like  okay  oh  you're trying  to look like  a big shot 
[03:17:00]  of course  hold on  I'm busy  so he charges  like 25 or 30 bucks  for a signed  8x10  and says  here  I'll give you  a CD  for free  signs the CD  and then he  writes down  the dates  that he's appearing  under his autograph  on the CD  that's a good  wow  that's nine extra  people  maybe he's trying  to pick you up  Sam  no he wasn't  signing it for me  he's probably  trying to pick you up  I mean I was there  with just E-Rock  fortunately my  girlfriend had other  plans  he's playing at the  Tillis Center 
[03:17:30]  for the Performing Arts  where I saw Joe  with a 2U  okay  they played there  and now you can see  Tom Wopat there  I want to know  what the Kentucky gig was  he did a thing  he said  what was a thing  in Kentucky  Dukes of Hazzard  reunion  yeah  Kentucky  like about  three weeks ago  actually I'm going to  blow pretty quick  I got a gig  I'm playing a couple  of concerts out  on Long Island  tonight  a lot of times  when two people  are teamed up  to perform together  they end up  getting very tired  of working with 
[03:18:00]  each other  did you ever have  that animosity  or just boredom  working with  on the Duke  no we have  we have a good time  always  pretty much  pause real quick  what do you think  of  you have a good time  doing what  where's the good times  I've had enough  of his  just languishing  in these fucking  vagaries  we did a thing  a few weeks ago  it was fun  yeah we have a good  what does that mean  you're just talking  nothing's coming out  Sam you gotta get  a little nastier 
[03:18:30]  at times  well I got nastier  with the goofballs  and costumes  but it's like  costumes  sorry  costumes  costumes  there's a great deal  of sympathy  when what  when I'm talking  to these celebrities  celebrities that do what  that is not  what he did  is it  is it  we found out  what he did  he was at  the free festival  London Kentucky  at the 20th annual  World Chicken Festival  no wonder he wasn't  specific  exactly 
[03:19:00]  oh my god  Colonel Sanders  founder of Kentucky  Fried Chicken  is one of the most  highly recognized  figures in the world  what the dukes  of tazard  County Kentucky  located in the heart  of beautiful  Danil Boone  National Forest  proud to be the home  of the Colonel's  first and original  restaurant  and I guess  they have a giant  party there  of course  what is he  that Tom Wopat  showed up  big thing  in Kentucky  is he a local  DJ  fried at chicken  fried at chicken  fried at chicken  you hear me  Tom Wopat  I think Tom Wopat 
[03:19:30]  is a local DJ  that's local DJ  shit  oh wow  hey uh  Homeless Jim  writes from  Buffiston  Lou Ferrigno  is the biggest  ass at these  cons  I thought he  wanted to shake  my hand  but he was  just reaching  for the 20  in my other  hand  he also gets  less muscular  with every  convention that  passes  his pectoral  region was  much slimmer  was it  yes  how much  for a photo  with him  you can take  that with  a digital  right  yes  but I  believe  it's  $20  when you  see like  Shatner  can you  take the  picture  with him  with the  digital  here's  the thing  they don't 
[03:20:00]  tell you  you can  but you  have to  because  like  with the  Bruno  Sammartino  thing  I took a  picture  there's a  line  Rick Flair  was doing  the same  thing  you have  to wait  online  for an  hour  to get  your  picture  with Rick  Flair  and then  they take  the picture  and they say  okay come  back in like  an hour and a  half and pick  up your  picture  because we can't  print all these  out now  you go okay  you come back  in an hour and a  half and you  have to wait  online for an  hour to pick  up the picture  why do they do  it that way  I think they don't  want you having  a digital picture 
[03:20:30]  no and they  charge you extra  at the table  too if you  want an actual  CD burn of  the JPEG  they charge you  another 15 to  $20 on top of  all that  now I'm just  getting mad  I understand you  have to make  some money when  you're doing  your thing but  you're just  ripping off your  fucking hardcore  fans these  aren't even  like casual  fans I had  just take the  picture with my  camera first  I'm so fucking  annoyed right now  and then I  blew up when I  got back to the  table and the  people on the  line were like  yeah this is the  line to pick up  pictures we've been  here for an  hour I blew it  off get the fuck  out of here  why would they do 
[03:21:00]  that a lot of it  is the company  that schedules  these celebrities to  be there it's not  really the  celebrities themselves  they want the  celebrity to look  like he's got a  line all day long  like Shatner was  an exclusive he  didn't have a  booth or anywhere  you could go and  get something signed  or talk to him or  anything you had to  buy the $80 ticket  to stand online for  an hour to get a  photo that they  take and will  print out for you  so you don't  actually have a  copy of your  picture with Shatner  because they can  charge you more on  top of that so you  can get the JPEG  it's enraging 
[03:21:30]  then you have to  scan it if you  want more copies of  it you have to go  home take the 8x10  that they print out  on a printer it's  not like a photo  place it's a  really it's like  printer it's like  an inkjet printer  80 bucks for a  fucking printer  photo it's photo  paper it's photo  paper but it's just  they print it out  right there  don't smear it  don't touch it  it'll smear  and then you have  to scan it  to get it on  your computer  that's disgusting  get your flatbed  scanner out  oh I'm going to  one of these things  we're going to  chiller  oh yeah we're  going  will they give you  a clear photo 
[03:22:00]  a good photo or no  they do take  a couple pictures  and they give you  the best one  they won't give  you a digital  copy  no not unless  you I mean some  people pay extra  but like at this  booth no  there used to be  a company that  even though you  paid extra for  the digital copy  they'd watermark  their logo like  on the very bottom  of the photo  so you'd see the  name of the  photography company  on the bottom  of your photo  even though you  paid extra for  the digital copy  alright let's get  back to the  Wolpat riveting  interview 
[03:22:30]  riveting  on the  dude  shoot no  we have a  we have a good  time  yeah  always  pretty much  and uh  what do you think  of being here  at comic-con  the caliber of  people that  you're meeting  the caliber of  people  it's an  interesting crew  I'll tell you  that  and people  you know  they're avid  about their  interests  and you got  to respect  that  I  you know  do you ever  get creeped out  why not  I'd like to  know one  interesting thing  just one  that you've seen  that you certainly  have not been 
[03:23:00]  conveying in this  interview  one interesting  thing  Big Kev wants it  Big Kev  what's up  Opie  Opie  listen  two things  number one  if they want to  charge a lot of  money to sit there  and do nothing  all day because  no one wants  their autograph  or whatever  they know what  they're getting  into  and number two  make sure that  you're blaming  both sides of the  coin  if any of these  people have  lines it's because  they're big enough  fans to want to 
[03:23:30]  pay that amount  of money  Kev I totally  get that  trust me  but they're  so taking  advantage  knowing that  these are  uber fans  that'll do  pretty much  anything  if one of  these guys  stands up  and goes  suck my  dick  half these  people would  get on their  knees  immediately  they're  taking  advantage  of  hardcore  fans  the last  months  you think  it's taking  advantage  of  dude  the whole  explanation  with the  photo  is  disgusting  I agree  with you  that's  disgusting  they don't  tell you  you're going  to have to 
[03:24:00]  wait online  for an hour  to pick up  your picture  what's the big deal  if you get a  digital picture  that you're  in the picture  with the celebrity  I totally  agree with that  and Shatner  is  the reason  they do  that  is  like  the fellas  said  there  is  because  they can  make  another dime  on it  so like  Anthony  was saying  earlier  the photograph  from Shatner  was 75  I think  the photo op  as they're  referred to  I think  that was  maybe  another  50  see  we're not  too far  off  I understand  to a point 
[03:24:30]  but it's  a little  disgusting  it's like  taking advantage  of the  retarded  yeah  E-Rock  E-Rock  E-Rock just  throws his arms  up  he's like  what  Mossman  Mossman  I don't  think  E-Rock  actually  found  a Mossman  that day  this is  going to  shock  a lot  of people  but we're  in the  entertainment  business  ourselves  and we  understand  you can't  charge your  listeners  for everything  you do  that's just  not cool  absolutely  there are 
[03:25:00]  radio guys  that do  that by  the way  I was  going to  start  asking  like when  people  were taking  pictures  I was  going to  turn around  and go  hey  dude  after they  took the  picture  I was  going to  hey  25  but I  was too  embarrassed  to even  make the  joke  you should  do it  without a  booth  that's  what I was  doing  I was  walking  around  and people  were like  dude  could I  take a  picture  I'm like  yeah  sure  do you  guys  want to  get an  Opie and  Anthony  booth  at the  next  convention  separate  pictures  we don't 
[03:25:30]  do the  same  thing  I want  to  extend  the  invitation  certainly  to  Jimmy  that  the  big  chiller  convention  I'm  busy  when  is it  I thought  you  want  to  meet  superstars  like  Ann  Margaret  and  Mickey  Rooney  we  already  talked  about  that  Opie  wants  to  go  too  and  so  does  Anthony  I want  a copy  of the  movie  Bill  and I  want  Mickey  Rooney  to sign  it  and I  just  wanted  to say  oh boy  chicken  like the  movie  so  it's in 
[03:26:00]  Parsippany  yeah  we'll figure  it out  we've got  to wrap  up  I might  go  take  it  easy  bye  they're  avid  about  their  interests  and  you  gotta  respect  that  do you  ever  get  creeped  out  when  a  fan  will  have  more  information  about  the  show  that  you  were  on  than  you  could  ever  possibly  know  no  not so  much  they're  a little  more  involved  with it  for me  the show 
[03:26:30]  has been  over  for 25  years  so I  don't  really  dwell  on it  too  much  people  that are  really  into  it  they really  develop  an  encyclopedic  knowledge  of what's  going on  in the show  so it's  interesting  sometimes  I'll learn  stuff  about the  show  that I  didn't  know  and how  awful  was the  movie  the remake  you know  what I  didn't see  it  I wouldn't  have  if I  were you  either  alright  well it's  nice  talking to  you  by the  way  he saw  the movie  of course  he did  yes  of course  he did  he saw  the show  that he  was on 
[03:27:00]  he cares  very deeply  about  Dukes  of  Hazzard  you don't  think if  we were  done  and then  like  like  fucking  25 years  from now  there's a  new  Opie and  Anthony  show  based on  our  characters  that I  wouldn't  at least  listen to  an episode  me and  E-Rock  doing it  with little  Jimmy  no  you'd be  all mad  that you  didn't get  a cameo  in it  you'd be  like that  bitter  cooter  guy  why  didn't  they 
[03:27:30]  put  me  in  shut  up  there  was  I love  these  fossils  wonder  like  stupid  fucking  Batman  what's  his  name  Adam  West  was  all  mad  when he  wasn't  putting  the  original  first  Batman  as  Batman  not even  like a  cameo  like  asshole  yeah  your  baloney  tits  are  going to  look  real  good  in  the  new  Batman  suit  Adam  would  walk  around  like  he'd  walk  away  from  the  Batmobile  to start 
[03:28:00]  schmoozing  with people  in the  hallways  he would  bring them  back while  they're  talking  to lure  them to  take a  photo  with him  at the  Batmobile  Johnny Fairplay  was outside  the place  smoking  some kid  goes up to him  and he goes  hey  can we get a  picture real  quick  and Fairplay  goes  I would  but we gotta  do it back  in my booth  they get  mad at me  otherwise  and I just  started pointing  and laughing  at him  nobody  gets mad  at you  they do 
[03:28:30]  yeah  they  and then he  fully admitted  yes he was  indeed  scamming  nobody  gets mad  we got a  real dumb  one on  instant feedback  oh cool  I would love  to next time  leave your name  and address  and your phone  number so  people could  call you  charge fans  oh did you  forget about  audible.com  fucker  what  are you  fucking  kidding me  do you think  we get  a fucking  money  from that  what are  you talking  about  so actors  shouldn't sell  movie tickets  that's the  company 
[03:29:00]  that's the  company doing  that shit  we're talking  about all  this other  stuff we do  oh my god  all the free  events we do  for the fans  we could charge  for everything  we do  how much did  you guys charge  for pictures  and autographs  after the virus  tour when you  stayed for  like two hours  that's good  two hours  you're being  nice  some of those  virus  some of those  virus shows  we were there  for three hours  after the event  ended we didn't  make a fucking  dime  that's the point  of trying to  make asshole  someone's gotta  be an asshole  why don't you  charge to put 
[03:29:30]  a shotgun  in your mouth  I'll pay  and supply it  we're talking  about all the  extra stuff  right now  our careers  are such  that we're  doing it  for SiriusXM  where you have  to pay for  this  okay this was  the opportunity  that was handed  us  and the audible.com  I don't even  know if we make  money to be honest  I really don't  if we do  it's a very  tiny little  percentage  I don't know  I really don't  know  I'd love to  get an accounting  I charge for  photos  you do  that's right  yes  hey can I  take a picture 
[03:30:00]  with you  that'll be  $41  shit stain  that's gotta be  inconvenient  that they gotta  pull a single  out  that's right  an extra single  $40  and 20 nickels  that's a lot  I want 220's  and 20 nickels  that's a lot  of pocket money  that's right  Ant's doing  Ant's doing free  broadcasts  I'm making videos  this is all stuff  we probably  could charge  for  there's  a very popular  fucking radio  personality  that does  exactly that  charges for  everything he does  that's the point 
[03:30:30]  I'm making  Jimmy Norton  I give a discount  for good fans  if you wish  a hello from  Jimmy  will cost you  $7  well wishing  from Jimmy  are $10  salutations  from Jimmy  are $11  and 38 cents  alright  Sam ran  into a big  celebrity  that wasn't  scheduled to be  there  this was my  biggest celebrity  we're gonna have  to break the  interviews into  two parts 
[03:31:00]  we're gonna do  this last  one or two  and then we're  gonna save  the rest  for tomorrow  yeah save  all the superheroes  for tomorrow  because the superheroes  are ridiculous  I hear they're great  they're fucking hilarious  they're great interviews  we probably should have  started with that  no end with it  end strong  tomorrow with that  we're here at  Big Apple Con  with Anthony  from the Opie and Anthony  show  Anthony what's the hat  jeez Ed  you're at a booth  and everything  that's pretty neat  how did you not know  he was gonna be there  he wasn't scheduled  I wasn't scheduled  I just popped in  people just started texting  hey did you hear 
[03:31:30]  who just showed up  Anthony  so E-Rock and me  scoured throughout  the whole thing  E-Rock stopping  at every toy booth  and finally we found him  on the concession line  a fan actually came up  that doesn't listen  to the show  Only Knew Me  from Red Eye  I've got a lot of that too  Only Knew Me  from fucking Red Eye  yep  how the fuck does that  that's pretty cool  yeah  Bill in Philly  hello  hello  Bill  what up Bill  good morning gentlemen  hey  listen I wanna talk 
[03:32:00]  about that guy  who just talked about  audible  fuck you  he's got  you know  Jimmy Norton  after his show  sits around  I ask for an autograph  he gives it to me  he doesn't say  no buy my book  and then I'll sign it  for you  if you bring your own book  he signed it for me  you guys  again  stay two or three hours  after the show  and if you remember  years ago  you know  you guys were  constantly  talking about  your little  underground  syndicate  you know  so you guys  have done more 
[03:32:30]  for fans  for nothing  and that motherfucker  is gonna bring up  somebody spending  nine dollars a month  well the audible  the audible  is another way  to listen to the show  if you don't  subscribe to Sirius XM  we're in the pay radio  we're in the pay radio  business right now  who knows what our careers  are gonna you know  lead us to  but  he's a fucking asshole  for as much as you guys  have done  for nothing  the point is  we've done a lot of  stuff for free  all those live gigs  and stuff  I mean 
[03:33:00]  you know  it's kind of insulting  to be honest with you  guy's an asshole  I'm hoping to do that  Kentucky chicken  festival  absolutely  what I'm gunning for  alright Bill  I appreciate the  backup there  thank you  keep talking Bill  let's go back to Anthony  a big get for Sam  at this Comic Con  we're here at  Big Apple Con  with Anthony  from the Opie and Anthony show  Anthony what's the haves  well I've come here  just to check out  the scene  see some  huge celebrities  I hear 
[03:33:30]  now I don't know  if this is true or not  but I hear  rumor  has it  Tom Wopat  and John Schneider  in one place  at the same time  I interviewed  Tom Wopat  no you didn't  yes I did  thanks to this  he's now the second  biggest celebrity  that I've interviewed today  wow  who's the first  you  oh my  of course  I feel  stunned  and  just flattered  the Iron Sheik  is here too  how is this worse  than the Tom Wopat interview 
[03:34:00]  I know  it is  Sam just brings out  the worst in people  I don't mean  I don't mean in a way  where it's like  wow that was really bad  like  you bring out  the  the dullness  oh like I make other people  look bad  not me  no  no  it's not my  I'm not the dull questioner  no  it's just  yeah  you kind of just  are there  and you're  you're kind of smarmy  you're a lump 
[03:34:30]  yeah  so you just kind of  sit there going  I don't know  what am I going to  what do you want me to say  yeah the questions  are all about you  shining  and not the guest  shining  yes  so you can make it  about yourself  hey how about  those haps  that's the mistake  you're making  this is all about that  you're in the haps  I told you  what's the word  Clyde  alright it's all about you  just flattered  the Iron Sheik  is here too  I did see the Iron Sheik  his bodyguard  was rolling him through  in his wheelchair  yes  to actually  to go to the bathroom 
[03:35:00]  which is odd and ironic  because why would he  like actually go to a bathroom  when he could just  piss himself  right there in the wheelchair  he's done before  he's done it before  what's the biggie  you think he's ever  going to live that down  hell no  not on this show  that's brought up  every other minute  there's never a moment's peace  for that poor man  poor Iranian  fucking tranny lover  his leaky  fucking penis  poor little cocked  fucking Zionist  giant boulder sized prostate  exactly  can't hold in any piss  giant bald apostate 
[03:35:30]  Turkish taffy in the heat  balls  I sit on my testicles  in my wheelchair  you had an interview  with David Bowie  um  no  David Bowie from Labyrinth  is there a difference  it's Bob of Bowie  from Maryland  it was a person  who was disguised  oh  he was in a costume  yes 
[03:36:00]  it was a  David  a young man  in a  David Bowie from Labyrinth  costume  that's ridiculous  really  alright  let's finish up  the big interview  with Anthony  and then  the rest of the interviews  we'll have to wait  till tomorrow  yeah keep them  you know what you do  you always leave them  wanting more  that's right  Jimmy  that's right  you're just here  as a reporter  that's all  I'm here to report  the events of the day  I got a regular  wristband  did you get  wait on line  I did  because I had to  wait on line  you  let me tell you 
[03:36:30]  something  I'm not used to that  I didn't like it  at all  what is  like  I was standing on it  and go  what is this  and someone said  a line  and I'm like  people stand on these  were you afraid  that somebody  waiting on the line  would come up to you  and say  weren't you  Anthony from  Ophian  I thought that was  going to happen  I expected  at any moment  to be whisked in  and not have to  wait on a line  so it was upsetting  to actually have to do that  this is going to really  upset you  Iraq told me  he was waiting on line  and a fan behind him  scolded the security guard 
[03:37:00]  saying  don't you know  who this is  it's Iraq  and Iraq was indeed  whisked to the front  alright  that does piss me off  because I actually saw  Lou Ferrigno  waiting on the line  they wouldn't even  let him in  look  I don't have time  to really stand around  here  I got huge celebrities  to see  well Tom Wopat  is that way  and I'm going that way  and I hear there's a  DeLorean here  it is yeah  it's got video screens  like in the headlights  but the one from the movie  didn't  it's got a lot of 
[03:37:30]  video screens in it  oh fuck  what is it  empt out  a little  car customizer  yeah just leave it at that  alright well you have  a good time  have fun  I just want to  stop it  exactly  I kind of felt that one  Jesus  Greg from  Greg  you're the one that  wrote about Audible  oh  yes Opie  you guys get 95%  of that money  out of Audible  yep  alright 
[03:38:00]  yeah you're right  we don't  I just looked at  the contract  this is a joke  right  95%  it's right there  on the website  Opie  yep  95%  I remember that  you guys take  every penny of ours  yeah  yeah we're taking  every  then you don't  have to listen  do you get it  oh fuck  I did not see that one  I knew he was  it's on the website  it's on the website  what the people make  exactly  it's in the contract  what makes you think  you'd be honored anyway  it's in the contract 
[03:38:30]  oh fuck  you're pissed  I can tell  I don't know  I think Bob gave  away the Audible  thing too  like he pretty much  gave away everything  else for us  oh shit  that was nice Bob  that was smart  so tomorrow  as we continue  with the interviews  Sam meets Iceman  who's covered in  blue paint  Sam meets David  Bowie from  Labyrinth  and talks about  his bulge  Sam meets the  Joker and asks  about who the  Jokers met 
[03:39:00]  then the Joker  gets serious  and drops character  when Heath Ledger  comes up  oh yuck  Sam meets a  Ghostbuster  who has a lot  of info  Sam talks to  the Ghostbuster  about Ernie  Hudson  since pathetic  Ghostbuster  suit  Sam meets a  guy playing  with a lightsaber  toy sword fight  guy explains  how awesome  his club  is to Sam  he has a  club  people  all these  enemies  are great  swords  lightsabers  yeah  Jimmy
