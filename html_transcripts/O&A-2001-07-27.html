<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with seemingly random banter referencing Madonna's concert, Charles Nelson Reilly, and a desire for "manlier" content, quickly transitioning to a Lifestyles Condoms commercial.  Frank Caliendo was a guest in the studio.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Caliendo, engaged in a lengthy discussion about "Old Bill," a movie featuring a mentally disabled character, using derogatory terms like "retard" to describe individuals with intellectual disabilities.  The conversation extended to people with Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, employing similarly offensive language.

Opie detailed his experience at a Madonna concert, describing the audience as overwhelmingly gay using homophobic language.  He and Anthony debated Madonna's setlist, with Opie criticizing the lack of older hits.  Listener calls followed, some commenting on both the concert and the hosts' offensive language.  Stephen Lynch's song "Special Ed," satirizing a person with intellectual disabilities, was played.  A Mickey Rooney life insurance commercial and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed were promoted.  Ben, who attended the Madonna concert with Opie, revealed plans to attend another show with two women.  The ongoing "Man Boob Contest" was promoted, with a call from contestant "Little Stevie," whose picture of a supposed "tumor" was featured on the website.  Little Stevie shared an anecdote about a guest lying about being unavailable to contact his girlfriend.

A prank call, supposedly from Nathan Lane, was quickly identified as fake.  Caliendo performed a comedic bit combining Harry Carey's commentary style with Super Mario Brothers gameplay, leading to discussion about animation and voice actors in classic cartoons. Further listener calls included criticism of the hosts' homophobic language and a discussion of a perceived "gay quota" for the show.  A listener submitted a Flintstones audio clip with added profanity, intended for online posting.  More man-boob contest calls followed, interspersed with a Colin Powell audio clip featuring a bizarre rendition of "El Paso" with Vietnamese lyrics, a Sam Adams beer commercial, promotion of Caliendo and Jim Norton's shows, and banter about Jamaican Mike, a parking garage employee, including audio purportedly of Jamaican men with women.  A final call concerned a girlfriend's trip to Bermuda.  The hosts discussed bands' treatment of fans, specifically C.C. DeVille charging for autographs.

A significant portion of the show focused on Rudejams.com, a website showcasing pictures of Jamaicans' genitalia, sparking conversations about race, sex tourism, and sexual preferences.  Callers Shelly and Mike shared anecdotes about trips to the Bahamas and the preferences of American women there.  Plenty Up Top, a large-breasted exotic dancer, and Al Pacino (not the actor) were in-studio guests, engaging in sexually suggestive conversation about Plenty Up Top's breasts, their size, and authenticity, including demonstrations with a flashlight.  The conversation included discussions of breast implants and procedures.  The "Man Boob Contest" continued, featuring Jim, a dialysis patient, with detailed descriptions of his body and medical condition.  Recurring callers Marion and Lady Di joined the show, with commentary focusing on their physical appearance and weight changes, accompanied by old photos.

The broadcast included a lengthy and chaotic segment with Lady Di and Marion, centered on their appearance, with numerous crude and sexually suggestive comments from the hosts and guests.  There were repeated requests (and refusals) to see their underwear, a story about someone ingesting a hypodermic needle, comparisons of Marion to Henrietta Hippo, and a running gag about their "yin-yang party" pictures.  A caller line facilitated further insults and jokes.  The segment concluded with a Bud Light-sponsored CD-smashing segment where Lady Di threw items at the hosts, followed by a final Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed commercial.  The show finally concluded with a discussion of Pee-wee Herman's arrest for indecent exposure and anecdotes about pornography theaters, and a story about a drunk driving prevention program coordinator arrested for drunk driving at a DWI awareness picnic.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  How are my little pigs today?  Do I have to drive the bus? Can I ride on the bus? Where's the bus?  The thing with the young girl is, I think we're going to have to, well, I'll go to court with you.  She's not 18. She's not 18. It's a mockery.  There's no peace.  Do I have to drive the bus? Can I ride on the bus? Where's the bus?  How are my little pigs today?  We use you for good radio. We're not just friends.  Unbelievable.  Oh my lord, shoot me now.  The thing with the young girl is, I think we're going to have to, well, I'll go to court with you. 
[00:00:30]  I don't know which one's which. Opie and Anthony.  Do I have to drive the bus? Can I ride on the bus? Where's the bus?  Lewis Black.  He's probably at home listening going, they're doing it all wrong.  Opie.  How are my little pigs today?  And Anthony.  Friday.  Friday.  Wow, I'm in a dress. 
[00:01:00]  Hey, everybody. We're all going to get laid.  Fuck it off, dick.  Hey, man. Save me a poem.  She was a whore.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog. 
[00:01:30]  Your balls are healing.  What? Can it call an apple?  Hey, who's the stripper?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What is up?  Got to get right to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Huh?  Hey, where'd he go?  Gone.  He was listening to the Evil Knievel bit.  He said that it reminded him of the Mickey Rooney movie. 
[00:02:00]  And I'm wondering if it's the Mickey Rooney movie that we all know and love from this radio show.  Old Bill.  It's Bill. I got good hair and good teeth.  Yeah, that's where Old Bill comes from.  One of the best comedies ever made.  Yeah.  I've told that before when that movie came out.  It was in the early 80s or something like that.  And I was sitting with my girlfriend at the time. 
[00:02:30]  And we're watching the movie.  And I start laughing my ass off when Old Bill runs into the corner because his friend Perry or Barry.  Barry.  Yelled at him for taking all the chicken.  They bring out this big platter of chicken because Barry decides to take Bill, the retarded guy.  He's been in an institution for years.  And Barry decides to take him to his parents' house in Connecticut.  Nice house.  Yeah, because he's doing a documentary.  Right, right.  So the parents come out and the mother comes out with this big plate of chicken. 
[00:03:00]  And Bill goes, oh, I love chicken.  Oh, boy.  And just starts manhandling with his big, fat, retarded hands.  He's just getting all his retard juice all over it.  You know how that is.  You don't want to eat anything if a retard's been touching it.  You don't know where their fingers have been.  They're drooling or picking their nose or their butt or something.  So he's like pawing all the chicken. 
[00:03:30]  And the family's horrified, as would I.  So Barry yells at him, he goes, Bill, that's enough.  And Bill goes, oh, boy.  And runs into the corner in the kitchen and like takes his hair off.  And he's holding his wig.  And at that point, I couldn't hold it in any longer.  Because my girlfriend at the time is just crying.  She's crying because she's so sad about this movie and about Bill.  I just lost it.  I went like, I got a punch in the face.  Boom, you insensitive prick. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, that's me.  You know what we should do today?  We should make a list of movies that weren't supposed to be comedies but turned out to be for whatever reason.  I'll say Bill.  Bill is a good example.  The Other Sister.  Yeah, The Other Sister.  Another one.  One of the greatest comedies ever made.  One of the best retard actors of our time, Giovanni Ribisi.  Oh, my God.  Can that guy play a retard?  Even when he's not playing a retard.  He just looks retarded when he smiles.  Hey, you got to give it to Ed Norton, though. 
[00:04:30]  Ed Norton plays a great retard.  Ed Norton.  But he can play a regular guy.  You see that American History X.  He's no retard in that.  No.  He's a nut.  Yeah, but he turns out to be a pussy by the end of that film.  Well, boned kind of changes your perspective on things.  You know, I know we're jumping around like crazy here.  Why not?  Speaking of being boned in prison.  No, like I'm taking a sip of coffee.  Hey, speaking of being boned in prison. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, how about that prison boning?  Let me tell you.  No, during the Playboy interview.  Yeah.  That hot piece of ass was asking us, is there any time where sex is bad?  What?  Yeah.  And we thought for a few minutes, and then I said, well, yeah, if you're getting raped in prison.  Prison.  That constitutes bad sex.  Right.  Yeah, she wanted the definition of bad sex. 
[00:05:30]  That's it.  Jimmy.  Hey, guys.  Last night, I'm in bed.  It's like 1 o'clock in the morning.  I'm flicking around on TV.  And all of a sudden, I see a commercial for life insurance.  And guess who's doing it?  Mickey Rooney.  Oh, I know.  And now he just looks like an alien.  So what I did was, I just turned the mute off.  And I just started doing my Bill voice.  Hello, my name is Bill.  I have a harmonica.  I want chicken.  And my fianc√©e's bed next to me sleeping.  She wakes up and goes, what the hell are you doing? 
[00:06:00]  She had no concept.  But I was told to Anthony last night.  And I was going back to sleep.  And I said, I hate that bad sex.  I hate him.  You need life insurance.  Call Bill and he'll get hooked up.  It's wild Bill's life insurance.  Just like my coffee.  I have good hair and good teeth.  And another point when I started busting out, laughing, was when he was talking about the  institution he was in for so many years.  Because the story is supposed to be the guy really wasn't that retarded when he was a kid.  Maybe he had one of those kid diseases they get now that you could cure with some lithium 
[00:06:30]  or something, you know?  And they threw him in an institution.  And he spent his entire life up until he was like 60 years old or 55, whatever he was,  in an institution with retarded people.  So he ended up being retarded by proxy.  So Barry's yelling at him about something.  And he goes, please don't send me back to that place.  And I'm, wah!  I start cracking up and boom, punched again.  You said it, bitch!  Do the line where he's trying to remember Barry's phone number. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, this is classic.  Barry was the only friend this guy got, Bill.  The only friend he had.  Who was the chick in that movie again?  That didn't treat him like a complete retard.  I don't know, but she was, um...  No, Helen Hunt was in the remake, I think.  Or in the Bill on his own story.  Okay.  No, she was just some chick.  I thought it was Helen Hunt in the first as well, but...  But Barry was, uh, who was that?  Oh, God, one of the brothers.  Son of a bitch.  God, I'm usually pretty good with this stuff.  One of the brothers?  Yeah, yeah.  Quaid, one of the Quaid brothers. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, uh...  Not Randy Quaid.  Dennis Quaid.  Dennis Quaid, right?  Dennis Quaid was Barry.  So, uh, they got a better job.  Barry got a better job.  So he was going to move far away from Bill.  And, uh, he was checking out the place.  So he gave Bill his phone number so Bill could call him up.  And, uh, Bill's on the phone with the operator.  Number, please.  And Bill's like, I wanted to talk to Barry Moore.  Six, nine, two, eight, three, five, seven, two, three, twenty-eight, five, nine. 
[00:08:00]  There's too many numbers, sir.  Barry Moore.  One, eight, two, three, seven, five, nine, eight, two, twenty-three, eight, five.  Dave, again, I'm just dying.  We got to get sound clips from that movie.  Yeah, we used to play him on the show.  I went to rent it.  I cannot find this movie anywhere.  I don't think they put it out on video.  It's a scream.  You got to see this thing. 
[00:08:30]  Old Bill, I have regular good hair and good teeth.  He has his dentures.  Barry got him new dentures.  You know, I got to tell you, I was, um, I was talking to Jim Brewer.  Yeah.  In the office.  I was the only one in the office.  All you guys were at lunch and doing things, and, um, I, I, I think I wrecked my keyboard  because I spit coffee all over it.  One of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV, I don't even know if I'm going to be  able to translate this.  The, the, the, the senior British Open is on, right? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And one of these guys is setting up for a hundred and twenty yard shot to the green.  About a hundred and twenty yards.  And, uh, there, there are all these people behind, you know, the golfer as he's setting up  for the shot.  I hope there's someone that saw this.  And everyone is standing still because the guy's ready to go.  Got to be shot.  Got to be quiet.  Except for one person.  A, a mom and a kid in a wheelchair having a cerebral palsy attack.  Timmy!  Just like Timmy.  Just completely everything like, was like this. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, let me know, let me know, Timmy!  Completely losing it.  And the announcers just make them believe they're not seeing what everyone else, what everyone  at home is seeing.  What are they supposed to say?  Now, as, um, he's ready to tee off, look at that retarded child behind the tee.  Could be quite distracting to the golfer.  He was right behind the golfer, too.  Oh, my gosh.  I just see it out of the peripheral vision.  You're trying to tee off.  Oh, let me know, let me know, come on!  Someone shut that kid up.  So I'm on the phone with Brewer and I look up.  I see this, I spit coffee everywhere, I'm laughing. 
[00:10:00]  It's like, what's the deal, dick?  Deke.  I told him, and he laughed pretty hard.  Isn't it horrible when people go to, uh...  Like, yeah, you get the retarded kid, and...  Up in Boston.  Oh, there was, uh, one of the waitresses that worked at one of the restaurants I used to  go to a lot.  She had this retarded son.  Retarded son.  He was about, I don't know, uh, 15, 16 years old.  And, um, he comes to the restaurant one day, and she wants to introduce him to me, because  we're on the radio up there, like, he gives a crap. 
[00:10:30]  You know?  Listen to Radio Disney.  He's retarded.  Mongoloid.  Total.  The face.  Everything.  So, he's sitting down eating, and he, like, he picks up some french fries out of my plate  and starts eating it like he's just eating.  Now the french fries are done.  I can't eat them.  You can't now eat the french fries.  Call me a dick.  Call me insensitive.  But you don't want...  Because you know where those hands are?  They're always picking at something. 
[00:11:00]  They're...  They are.  Don't look at me like that.  They're always picking at something.  The ears, the nose, the...  Yeah, they're always...  Like, sucking in the snot with the whole back of the hand thing.  And now I'm supposed to be this nice, liberal-minded guy and eat snotty fries?  Retard snotty fries?  I don't want the retard snotty fries.  Oh, man.  It's terrible, but you don't want it.  Dixon, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  The sellout, or the payoff, in Bill is the credits when he sings. 
[00:11:30]  Where have you gone, Billy Boy?  Billy Boy, Billy Boy.  Where have you gone, darling Billy?  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  And Dennis Quaid's playing the harmonica to it.  Oh, no, no.  Bill starts playing the harmonica.  He's spitting all over it.  Where have you gone, Billy Boy?  Billy Boy?  Where have you gone, darling Billy?  Billy Boy.  Pluto.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I woke up every day this week, and I heard Howard slip in words from your show. 
[00:12:00]  Junk, paint, balloon nut.  Ah, well.  What are you going to do next week?  Have I taken out Tuesdays or the faggot futon?  Uh, Pluto, we said what we had to say yesterday.  I wanted to call him up, but he doesn't have a phone number to give out.  Nah, he doesn't put any of you guys on his show.  He's such a tool.  But, uh, no, we said what we had to say yesterday, and quite frankly, I don't need him crying  to the big bosses again today, so we're going to just move on with our show, all right?  Okay, terrific.  All right, man.  He's got the sound.  Oh, Patrick, what's going on? 
[00:12:30]  How much, guys?  How's it going?  You tell us.  You're in your car.  What's happening?  Well, you got to ask Paul Scum to that with the funny retard movies.  Oh, another movie that wasn't supposed to be funny, but turned out to be funny.  Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Watch that F word.  All right, you got to talk later.  I think Forrest Gump, though, you know, they went for some laughs in that, of course.  Oh, I got to interrupt.  This guy saw the British Open retard guy.  Michael.  Yeah, I saw it.  Come on.  How funny was that? 
[00:13:00]  It was like a fish out of water, man.  If someone has that tape, maybe for some weird reason you're taping the senior British Open  like you would care.  But there is a piece of tape on there that is absolutely priceless that we would love  to put on our website.  See him skipping out in the whole nine?  Yeah.  He's got to have total control over the game.  You saw the guy.  He's setting up maybe like a seven iron or something.  The guy's right behind him just having a, it looked like an epileptic senior.  Come on.  When something was going on.  Like a fish out of water, without a doubt. 
[00:13:30]  The fact that it reminded me of King Gimp, you know what I mean?  Oh, and King Gimp lost his effing mind.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, Michael, that's exactly what it was.  It was a younger version of King Gimp.  Nice.  And the mother's trying to control it and the whole deal.  And you see the guy's just kind of like really nervously.  It's right in front of your face, but here he is approaching the shot.  Yeah, I turned up the sound.  Yeah.  The announcers have got to mention this because it's right there in front of your face.  You can't miss it.  Yeah.  It was like a 1952 electrocution in a chair. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, man.  All right, Michael, thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Hey, back to retards handling your food.  Yeah.  Now, not just retards, but just people in general.  Did you ever not look at people that are preparing your food because you don't want to be disgusted?  Like when you go up and maybe retarded kids are working at McDonald's or something.  I don't like looking at what they're doing.  So I will just turn away until the food's in the bag and they bring it and go, you know.  And another thing I don't look at when you go on, and I haven't had one of these in quite some time, 
[00:14:30]  but the old New York City street hot dog thing, you never look at the vendor's hands ever.  I looked once, and this is why I don't eat hot dogs on the street anymore.  He had fingernails that were like a dead person's length long, you know, like they bring out of the coffin in the movies.  They continue to grow.  And there's just black under his nails.  You know why that is.  And he's holding the bun in his hand, and I'm just like, yeah, right, I'm going to sink my teeth into that. 
[00:15:00]  You know why that is, though?  Because they don't use toilet paper when they wipe.  Why?  Ah!  They can just stick those hands right into the steaming hot water to pull out the hot dogs.  But they don't.  It might be clean then.  They're just big.  They were these big, gnarly, black fingernails.  And so I paid for the hot dogs, and I threw them right away.  I threw them away.  I had to throw them away.  Just like the retarded snotty fries.  You know, you're throwing them away.  You're probably pissing off a lot of people with your discussion today. 
[00:15:30]  Quite frankly, I don't care, but I know.  You do have to say the other side.  I used to go to McDonald's there in Huntington.  Oh, yeah.  You got to explain that.  Burger King.  Burger King.  In Huntington.  And I walked in, and there was a Down Syndrome girl working there.  Hot.  Okay, I'm kidding.  She was working there, and look at how troubled you look at me.  What wig did she have on?  They all have the mohair cut.  Stop.  No, they all look alike with different wigs.  No, she had the Pete Rose. 
[00:16:00]  Yes, she did have the standard Pete Rose.  But she was very efficient.  Because I'm terrible when I go into these fast food places sometimes, and you can't get good service.  People there are mutants.  They don't understand your order.  They get it wrong all the time.  But she was very fast and had the order filled, and it was very accurate.  So there you go.  One for the mongoloids, right?  Right.  See, I'm sensitive.  I have my sensitive side.  Joe, what's going on? 
[00:16:30]  Yo, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Down here in Philly.  Hey, thanks for the support down there.  Hey, that movie, My Left Foot, that was a good one with the guy drawing all over the piano and trying to be all artistic and everything.  He's like, yeah, I'm going to play my piano and draw it on my feet.  Oh, God damn it.  You can't help.  All right, guys.  Yo, keep it up.  You're kicking ass down here in Philly.  Everyone loves you.  We appreciate it.  Thank you.  All right.  And thank you, YSP. 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  There was yet another movie that was not supposed to be funny.  What was the one with Sean Cassidy and Linda Pearl?  I don't remember the name of it.  I think it's something like normal people or regular people.  No, not ordinary people.  It was like normal people.  I can't remember the name of it.  But they wanted to get married.  They were retards.  And they fell in love. 
[00:17:30]  You know, however much love a retard can fall into.  Well, they love colored balloons.  They need cotton candy.  What the hell's a...  They need loving, too, Anthony.  Of course they do.  I'm not saying they don't.  And they get it.  And their parents love them.  And they love them back.  But, you know, how deep could a love relationship be between two retarded people?  Quite frankly.  You put a little sparkly glitter thing in front of them, they're happy.  You know?  So you're saying their love is superficial because they can love a hot dog the same way they can love another person.  Right. 
[00:18:00]  They love like a colorful spinning pinwheel just as much as they love each other, I would think.  How deep could that love be?  They're fascinated by, I don't know, a hamster in a cage or something.  Wow.  But that movie was very funny.  They wanted to get married.  The parents, of course, didn't want them to get married because they're retarded.  And they professed their love to each other in just a scream of a scene.  I love that.  And we're going to get married. 
[00:18:30]  Very funny.  Yes, Ben.  Very funny.  I think if you're going to get married, you've got to be able to move out of your parents' house.  Yeah.  That's a good thing.  That's a good start.  Should be a requirement.  Mm-hmm.  Mario.  Yeah.  What's up?  I've got a good one for you.  How about Nell with Jodie Foster?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Remember that?  What, she was out in the jungle or something?  Yeah, she was kind of retarded.  Well, she never learned anything, right.  Yeah, she was like,  I'm sorry. 
[00:19:00]  That movie was classic for that, yes.  All right, guys, see you later.  All right, man.  Let's see what Tim has.  Tim, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, guys, I'm going to go off course a little bit.  All right.  What time is it?  It's 3.24.  It's not 5 to 7 like last night.  I hope I want to ask you, what stage of the Madonna-ism did you like?  What costume did you wear last night, guys?  Oh, look at the time.  We've got to take a break, Anthony. 
[00:19:30]  How was Madonna last night?  We truly have to take a break.  Do we?  Yeah, we really do.  Look at the time.  You know we break every day at 3.25.  All right.  When we come back, though, Opie at Madonna at the Madison Square Garden last night.  How was the show?  Do you like it?  Oh, you want to do this one, Rick?  All right.  Yeah.  I thought you were going the other one.  A lot of manly guys there last night, huh?  Oh, all right.  Yeah, we can talk about it.  Men's men.  All men's men down there, right?  I don't think... 
[00:20:00]  What about the facts?  I will say this before break.  Yeah.  I don't think I could have been in a more gayer place than Madison Square Garden last night.  Really?  And I'll just leave you with that.  Yeah, Madonna sure can bring in the facts.  Wow.  That's right.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  I was desperately searching for another heterosexual male, and it was very tough to find.  As we go to break, Anthony, Stephen Lynch.  Ah, yes.  Special Ed.  Kind of appropriate. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  This is about a childhood friend named Ed.  Ed.  Here we go.  Don't touch those buttons, either.  I see you looking at them.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very best friend. 
[00:21:00]  Ed was kind, with good intent, but just a little different, oh, special Ed.  Mama dropped him on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special. 
[00:21:30]  Just a little bit special.  We'd play tag, and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier, he'd eat dirt.  I liked math and a spelling bee.  Ed liked talking to a trio special. 
[00:22:00]  And Mama dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed.  Cause he's a little bit special.  A little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls.  Ed ran head first into walls. 
[00:22:30]  I had girls and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes.  Oh, special Ed.  Mama dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  He's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special. 
[00:23:00]  One day talking to special Ed.  He grabbed a brick and he swung in my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew.  Special Ed just made me special too.  And now I laugh as I count bugs. 
[00:23:30]  I give strangers great big hugs.  Next to me, Ed is fine.  He's a fucking Einstein.  Oh, special Ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head, you see.  Now we're not so bright.  Instead, we're a little bit special. 
[00:24:00]  Just a little bit special.  That bastard Ed made me special.  Oh, special Ed.  Just a little bit special.  All right.  There's the Steve Ellis we know and love.  There's some redemption.  Please forgive me. 
[00:24:30]  We're always accused of going a little too far, aren't we?  Yeah.  Daddy, show me your monkey.  Daddy, I'm really hot.  Daddy, can I eat some meat?  Daddy, you're just in my mouth.  Daddy, I'm under here now.  This tastes so good.  You're all burning in hell.  This is wrong.  Daddy, my poopy hurts.  My poopy hurts.  Daddy, can I give you a hummer?  Daddy, can I give you a hummer?  This is twisted.  Wrong on so many levels.  What's the leather cheerio?

How many oral favors did you see men giving other men during this song?  866-277-4-WOW.  You can just smell butt and lube.  Man, ass, and lubricant. 
[00:27:00]  All over Madison Square Garden when this one was playing.  There you go.  Woo!  Did they all just...  Woo!  Get up, man.  Woo!  Shut up, Frank.  Frank Caliento here in the studio.  Is he dressed as 80s Madonna?  No.  Yeah, what era did you prefer?  Oh, baby.  Was it the material girl? 
[00:27:30]  Like a virgin?  Yeah, I had the wedding dress on.  Did you have the wedding dress on?  The Vogue Madonna?  I went retro.  The wedding dress and you were Vogue.  I had the wedding dress on with the big cross.  Nice.  Were there a lot of cowboy hats there last night?  For Madonna's newest look?  What are you, gay?  For Madonna's newest look, a lot of cowboy hats?  All right.  Can we shut the music off so I can talk?  That's a little bit of a cowboy hat.  No.  I'm getting into it. 
[00:28:00]  Look at Stinky just came in and he's dancing.  You bet.  That's funny.  Stinky's dancing.  Yeah.  That's a winner.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  So he's seen his name?  Gay Falcon.  Yeah.  Rock. 
[00:28:30]  Butt sex.  Penises.  Have you ever seen a grown man naked?  I don't know.  Steve, I like having your background.  Who's that?  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Hooray!  Very good. 
[00:29:00]  Get a drink of a rat.  It's in the hole.  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Oh, somebody's bitch!  So how was it, Ophie?  You went to Madonna last night at Madison Square Garden.  It was interesting.  Did you go with anyone?  I went with Sandy.  Got a...  Jeez.  Just go along. 
[00:29:30]  Just a guy going along to the Madonna show.  Like I said before, Bray, I don't think you could have been in a more gayer place than Madison Square Garden last night.  There is a whole world out there that does not listen to the Ophie and Anthony show.  I'm convinced of it.  Well, yeah.  Well, you know, what made you think...  Okay.  You walk into Madison Square Garden.  Right.  First of all, it was like 75% female, 25% gay male, and one sorry idiot that went with his girlfriend. 
[00:30:00]  What tipped you off right when you got there that maybe a lot of the guys that went were gay?  Was there any red flags that came up?  Did your gaydar pick up anything?  Oh, maybe all the guys just making out openly everywhere?  No.  If anyone else went to the Madonna show last night, back me up on some of this stuff.  Don't say back you up.  Stop it.  Don't you know what sucked, though?  Every guy that was there? 
[00:30:30]  What sucked, though?  There was so much gayness around that I couldn't enjoy the lesbian couples making out.  Oh, that's it.  And there was a lot of that going on, too.  Was there?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  A lot of dykes into Madonna?  No, the nice ones.  Like the lipstick, nice lesbians making out.  Dressed like Madonna?  Dressed up with the cowboy hat.  Yeah.  The little half shirts and stuff.  Nice, right?  Unfortunately, a lot of the guys had the same exact outfit on. 
[00:31:00]  There's nothing worse than seeing that.  You know, this has to be said, though.  It was a good show.  How many guys in the wedding dresses?  No, I didn't see any of that.  Come on.  I didn't see it.  I mean, like I said in the back office, you know, it's so much easier to be a tough guy  and say it was stupid.  It was cool to check out.  I'm not going to lie to you.  A little nostalgic hearing some of the 80s songs.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Nothing like that?  She played mostly stuff from the last two albums. 
[00:31:30]  Ah, bitch.  She only played one oldie.  That was Holiday.  That's it?  That was it.  She didn't do Like a Virgin?  None of that stuff.  No.  No, it was...  What's up, Ben?  Wait, Ben, your mic's not on for some reason.  What happened there?  Turn Ben's mic on.  Is that mic off?  Oh, try it again, Ben.  No, for a mere 200 bucks, he got one old song.  You know, for 200 bucks, I want to hear the hits.  Not me, per se.  I just mean, you know, me if I had gone there and I would have wanted to have heard the hits. 
[00:32:00]  The stage show was amazing.  It really was.  Why?  More gay guys on stage dancing.  Oh, come on.  They were everywhere, even on the stage.  She was doing, like, the Matrix crap and, like...  How do you do the Matrix crap live?  Crouching Tiger crap.  She was on, like...  She was on a harness?  Yeah, and she was, like, 30 feet up in the air and doing all sorts of crazy things.  Flying Madonna.  Flying Madonna.  She's ripping Bon Jovi off.  Remember Bon Jovi did the Flying Bon Jovi?  Really? 
[00:32:30]  Van Halen.  Van Halen.  Everybody's just flying and then their name.  Man.  You ever notice that?  What's the deal with that?  Jay, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I'm staunch heterosexual.  And I was there also.  And it kicked ass.  You can't deny it.  It was a good show.  It was one of the best stage performances I've ever seen.  It really wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I would love to go on the air and, you know, go the easy route. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  But instead, everyone's going to call me a fag for the next hour.  But it really wasn't that bad.  Well, I'm going to jump in the barrel with you and take the heat, too.  Hey, Jay, how gay was Madison Square Garden, though, last night?  Extremely gay.  Oh, man.  Extremely gay.  Like, over-the-top, uncomfortable gay, where you were like, this is really uncomfortable to check out.  Like, Provincetown or Fire Island gay?  I have been to Provincetown, yes.  Oh, you have? 
[00:33:30]  Dude, straight people have been to Provincetown, you homophobe.  What did I say?  I said, oh, you have.  I was surprised to hear.  I could take calls for the next hour.  A ton of straight people have been to Provincetown.  Okay.  I'm sure Marco will call up and give us his experiences in Provincetown.  I've never been to Provincetown.  I don't know that there are a lot of straight people that go to a Provincetown.  It's a tourist trap.  A lot of, you know, regular, whatever.  A lot of straight people.  Regular.  You've got to watch what you say.  How was the pizza place? 
[00:34:00]  I hear at the end of the night, if you don't pick up a guy, there's a pizza place that all the rejects go to  and you just pick up their last chance at a piece of pepperoni.  The one thing I do want to mention about Madonna and, like, shows in general that you go to.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I hate seeing the people that have to dress like the artists on stage.  Yeah.  I don't get that either.  Now, let me tell you something.  Madonna, you know, she's done the whole cowgirl thing lately.  I'm sure, you know, you've seen the videos and stuff.  Sure.  So then you're looking around and you see a lot of girls with the hot cowboy, you know, hat look 
[00:34:30]  and, you know, the midriff exposed and the jeans that go real low these days.  Love that style.  Oh, nice.  Real nice.  Oh, yeah.  And then right next to, you know, that hot piece of ass is a fat chick trying to pull off the same look.  Don't you look in the mirror before you go to the show?  That makes it ten times worse, too.  If she had just walked out alone, the fat chick, with those clothes, you'd be like,  oh, maybe she shouldn't wear that.  But you see the exact same thing on a really nice body and then you look at that.  It makes it that much worse. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Like you were saying, you know, the old Madonna, the retro with the wedding dress and all that  crap, the like a virgin stage.  There were girls dressed up like that.  Some young that probably weren't even born when Madonna was doing that stuff.  Yeah.  But then the same thing.  You had a few fat chicks trying to do the early 80s Madonna look.  Probably pissed off she didn't play the S song.  Completely looking ridiculous.  $200 a ticket.  Completely hysterical.  I got off at Penn Station just to see it.  And there's like dudes and lift them.  You weren't the only guy getting off at Penn Station. 
[00:35:30]  Just like guys in dresses and stuff walking around 8th Avenue.  It was pretty hysterical.  It was.  That's great.  There's a whole world out there that has no clue about Opie and Anthony.  I am convinced of that.  Danny, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Opie, question.  Yeah.  What was it like when Madonna grabbed your hand and pulled you on stage and you got to sing  Lucky Star with her?  Biggie.  All right.  I'm going to go listen to Anthony.  Call me a tool.  All right.  Easy, fellas.  Now I want to do it.  Oh, look at this. 
[00:36:00]  You just happen to have the song ready and queued up.  Yeah.  Boy, you guys are witty radio guys.  And it's flying open.  Keeping in line with the name right after the flying part, as Frank Caliendo pointed out earlier.  Yeah.  This is going to be nothing after we go to NSYNC together.  Did she play this?  No.  No, she only played once.  What a twat.  You know, play the hits.  Anthony, she's an artist.  She doesn't like to look back.  She likes to move forward. 
[00:36:30]  That's being bitcheredly.  You know, you're reading the reviews, too.  And they say that, you know, every, the largest applause was for a holiday because people are just nuts.  And it was one of the last songs, wasn't it?  I think it was.  Oh, no.  She did music last, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, unless you're kneeling in front of a glory hall on a nightly basis, you don't know more than one song off the last two albums.  That's not true.  Get out of here.  You can't turn on MTV without seeing the music video.  I know.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:37:00]  Recent Madonna.  Here's what I know.  And I can only say, like, that one hit with her with the cowboy hat on the video, Kicking the Dirt.  I can name.  I don't know what that is.  And the Austin Powers video.  That's the only recent Madonna I know.  I can name five.  Faggot.  No.  And it's five everyone should know.  Which ones?  The one from Austin Powers, which was what?  Beautiful Stranger.  Okay.  All right.  That's one.  The one she sang on Letterman with the acoustic guitar was really, really good.  Which one?  See, you lost me right there.  I don't know.  I think you're talking about the cowboy one. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  That's the cowboy one.  The same one.  All right.  Don't tell me a story or something.  Where they have all those hot cowboy guys in the video.  I'm not talking about the video.  I've never seen that video.  That's the only way I hear the song.  But when she did it on Letterman, I mean, it was good.  Okay.  I'm not going to lie to you.  All right.  With the acoustic guitar, it was okay.  Two.  That's two.  Ray of Light.  Ray of Light.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I'll give you that.  Which was a, you know what?  Call Me a Fag.  That's a pretty cool song.  All right.  I'm going to say it.  I'm going to say it.  Whatever.  Well, you said Call Me a Fag.  All right.  That's three.  Three. 
[00:38:00]  Music.  Okay.  Where she's in the strip club.  Now, that's a cool video.  I know that one.  She's in the strip club and she's like working the chicks.  And she winds her way through that song.  Okay.  That's four.  Yeah.  And, oh, the remake of American Pie, where she looks really, really hot in that.  No.  That I don't even consider.  Why?  That's because it's a dopey remake.  But that's five songs.  And you call them, that's five songs that most people should know.  No.  Okay.  And how long was the show?  Play the old stuff.  Play those songs and then play all old stuff.  She didn't do American Pie, which I was kind of about. 
[00:38:30]  See?  There's more time to play old stuff.  I think she rips people off.  But too many people are afraid to give her a bad review.  And the gay guys don't care.  In all honesty, that's the only songs I know from the last few years of Madonna.  So what were you just sitting through like this pseudo techno crap that she puts on?  The stage show got you through the songs you didn't know.  And there were some cool video images and her flying around the stage.  I don't know.  Pull.  It was all right.  I'm going to the Madonna show.  I hear she flies. 
[00:39:00]  Pull.  I will go on record and tell you, my friend, it wasn't gayer than Aida.  Oh, well, that's a Broadway show.  You know?  Yeah, I went to go see Aida.  All right.  Well, I'll give you that.  I get, what, three fag points for that?  I don't know what the scoring is.  I don't even know what the scoring is anymore.  I would just be pissed that I didn't hear any of the older stuff. 
[00:39:30]  If I have to go to a Madonna concert, I'd remember to hear some of the older stuff.  Oh, she did, uh, uh, there was one more old song, um, uh, Las Itas Bonitas.  Oh, yeah, but who cares?  Who's that girl?  What is the name of that song?  I know, I know.  I know what he means.  Las Islas Bonitas.  Islas Bonitas.  Yeah, I know.  Rich, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Uh, last night at the show, when they were playing, uh, Truth or Dare with the audience,  exactly how much of the bottle did you get your mouth around?  Oh, you ain't a last night.  That old gag. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, is my time up yet?  Everyone asking if you were voguing at a Madonna.  Did she play Vogue?  She didn't do the Vogue.  No Vogue.  No Vogue.  That doesn't fit her new image.  No Vogue.  She just tosses those old songs away, huh?  I guess.  I guess.  Yeah, I don't know about that.  You're, I, you're seeing a, you're seeing an icon, though, for our time.  I don't care.  I'd want to hear, I'd want to sit there and, and hear stuff I know.  And I'd say this about any band I'd go to see.  Oh, without a doubt, I, I, I get pissed when you, you go see some of the bands you really  like, some of the, some of the guys that have been around forever, and yeah, they blow 
[00:40:30]  off all their old stuff to play the, shove the new stuff down your throat.  You want to go see, like, Aerosmith and only hear stuff off of, uh, Just Push Play?  No.  No.  That's Armageddon.  No is the worst.  No is the worst, when you, you mentioned that, and we talked about this about two years  ago, I went with my brother to see, uh, Neil Young at, uh, Radio City Music Hall.  This son of a bitch, right.  Holy, this is a perfect example of that, okay?  When, when you're an artist like this, and, and you're selling tickets, and your fans are  going to see you, they assume, especially for these outrageous ticket prices, it wasn't 
[00:41:00]  like Neil Young for eight bucks, it was Neil Young at the time, it was probably over  a hundred, I don't even remember.  That was a lot of money.  Yeah.  So if you're paying that much money for someone that's been around a long time,  you're expecting to hear all the songs you know and love from Neil Young, right?  Absolutely.  And maybe throw in a few, uh, new ones that he's working on.  Mm-hmm.  Dude, he played one piece of crap after another, and I, and I could go pretty deep into the Neil  Young catalog myself.  Right.  I didn't know any of this crap.  Most of the audience didn't know any of this crap.  And the guy behind me was yelling and screaming, getting more and more pissed. 
[00:41:30]  When the show started, they showed Neil Young, this guy was super Neil Young fan, just moves  in his S and I.  Neil!  Neil!  You rule!  Song by song by song goes by.  Oh, I don't, I don't know this one.  Okay.  No, that's cool.  Next song, man, it's going to rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Neil Young, you rock!  Five songs later.  When's the new stuff?  I mean, when's the old stuff coming?  Yeah, now he's bitching to everyone around him, and usually I get mad when people talk  at a concert, but I'm laughing my ass off, because he's saying exactly what everyone 
[00:42:00]  in this place was thinking.  So, there was a quiet moment, because now everyone's just politely applauding, because  they don't know any of these songs, and they're just trying to be nice.  Completely quiet at Radio City Music Hall, the guy stands up and shouts as loud as he  can, hey, Neil, how about one for us?  Yeah.  Oh, the whole place starts openly laughing now.  Good.  Uncontrollably.  And what did he do?  Anything?  I think he ended up, like, you know, he threw...  Threw your bone?  Threw us a bone and did, like, Cinnamon Girl or something.  Self-serving crap from some of these artists. 
[00:42:30]  You know, you want to play your new stuff or your experimental crap, do it in your basement.  When people pay a lot of money, they want to hear the stuff they know.  Right.  From Neil, or even Madonna.  I don't care what you say.  Opie went, I didn't.  I'm complaining about the show.  I'm a tool.  Yeah, but none of the early stuff would really interest me to see.  I mean...  No?  No.  I mean, she's brought out some interesting things lately.  You know, she's not as pop-friendly as she used to be. 
[00:43:00]  She's...  Dude, I wouldn't go out and buy, you know, a Madonna album, but I'm just trying to tell  you it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  You bought it for Sandy, didn't you?  I had to buy it.  I did have to buy it.  I wouldn't go out and buy one, but I did.  No, I had to...  You're right.  I bought the last two albums for, yeah, Sandy.  Yeah.  Took great flight to the gym once, but that was a mistake.  No, I'm just kidding.  That's a joke.  That's what we do here from 3 to 7.  Shut up.  Heather, what's going on?  Step class.  Not so much.  How about you?  Call Madonna. 
[00:43:30]  You went and saw Madonna?  Yeah, in Philadelphia.  All right.  And she put on an awesome show.  Yeah.  But I saw some crazy stuff.  Guy dressed in a wedding gown that had to be thrown out of the women's bathroom.  Oh!  I went into the guy's bathroom.  I wish I was in the...  Oh, my God.  I wish I went into the women's bathroom.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  Without a doubt.  It was...  I was really uncomfortable in there, man.  I mean, just tell you.  I've never seen so many gay men in one place my entire life.  It was over the...  I try to keep an open mind, but I was... 
[00:44:00]  Having a tough time taking all that in yesterday, man.  Yeah.  Some guy had tassels on his nipples.  Yeah.  What about the little American flag halter tops that a bunch of the guys were wearing?  Oh, my God.  We just people-watched, like, the whole time.  It was great.  Yeah.  And then you had the ladies.  Because, like, Madonna, I think she's, like, 43 or 44, and she's keeping herself in pretty  good shape.  She looks cool.  I don't find her attractive anymore at all.  I used to really think Madonna was, you know, so effing doable.  I don't see it anymore.  She has, like, arms like guys now and stuff. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  But there were women behind me that were about the same age as Madonna, trying to look like  how Madonna does.  I had a lot of older women trying to look young.  Oh, it was bad.  Yeah.  It was bad.  That's what you see a lot of the times when you go to those reunion shows of poison and  whatnot.  You see the 80s chicks trying to squeeze back into the spandex.  Get their hair high, you know.  Yeah.  They get into the old get-ups, and it just doesn't quite look right.  That leopard skin print in the spandex pants stretched over an ass that looks like you've  been sitting in the gravel driveway for two hours, showing every little dimple. 
[00:45:00]  Same crap happens at the Kiss shows.  Yeah.  People still trying to put the Kiss makeup on and the Kiss outfits.  It's like Artie the Plumber, dressed as Gene Simmons, doesn't quite pull it off,  you know?  Big fat guy.  It's like you take your face from the 80s with the Kiss makeup on, and then, you know,  if that same face was on like Silly Putty and you're just stretching it.  Juan is checking in.  He's saying, hey, guys, how about going to see Poison Warrant and Quiet Riot and hear them 
[00:45:30]  play all the stuff from their new albums as if they survived the 80s?  Good point.  Imagine that.  They don't realize it's over.  You know, all those people aren't going to, you know, hear stuff from your new album  that only 10,000 people will end up buying.  Hey, man, this one's from our latest album, man.  Oh, no, shut up.  Hope you all go out and buy it.  Stop.  Let's check in with Cleveland.  Matt, what's going on?  You guys are talking about Neil Young.  You guys are showing out, you know, God knows what, a C-9 and a half. 
[00:46:00]  Harris just played in Cleveland at, you know, our venue.  Played for three hours.  Not only did they have played in the venue, they brought a stage out onto the lawn.  They played for three hours.  They paid a music like $35.  And that's a show.  And Matt, they gave you all the hits, right?  Yeah.  I mean, everything from, what is it, the Rocks album all the way to Just Push Play.  Yeah.  And it came out for two encores.  Yeah.  I just thought, they understand what their fans are there for.  They want to hear the songs they grew up listening to.  Exactly.  And the venue that they play that, they've never, ever, I mean, I'm 30 years old, 
[00:46:30]  and I've never seen them bring a stage out into the lawn.  Yeah, that's cool.  You know, for the average Jody, you know, doesn't want to shell out a C-9 and a half.  Well, you two did that, too, with that, what was it, like a heart shape?  They come out to, like, half court, yeah.  Yeah, heart-shaped stage.  They're, like, playing some of their songs right in the middle of the venue in front of everybody.  That's cool, yeah.  And they play their old stuff, too.  They play, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See, you know, going back to the Neil Young, if Neil wants to charge $150 or whatever it  was at the time for a ticket, it should say right on the damn ticket, you will not hear 
[00:47:00]  anything you know.  Absolutely.  So at least you're prepared, because if you're paying that money, you're thinking,  nostalgia, Neil Young is going to play everything from his career.  Yeah.  I mean, you need a needle in the damage done.  Play it.  Didn't even play that.  Ah, son of a bitch.  One of my favorite Neil Young songs of all time.  He's an artist.  All right, Matt.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Or do it for free.  Go ahead.  You want to see Neil Young plowing through some new crap that he's playing around with?  Free show.  Or go to a little tiny club.  Yeah, go to a club. 
[00:47:30]  Close to you and do it.  Small cover charge.  Jackass.  Yeah, kind of survived the Madonna thing pretty well, I think.  Wasn't that bad, was it?  Yeah, you used the tactic of kind of the positive spin on it, where you said you had a good time.  Like I said, it wasn't that bad.  It was good.  It deflected a lot.  Would I go out of my way to see that?  I don't think so.  But I was there, and it wasn't bad.  What am I going to say?  When are you going to see Babs?  Barbara Streisand Show, no?  Speaking of icons, I have no desire to see that. 
[00:48:00]  Why would I?  Ugh.  You know?  What about Neil Diamond?  I was talking to Jim Brewer, because I was working some of this on Jim, saying, how will  I fare with the audience if I take this angle?  Oh, you're a faggy!  He goes, hey, man.  He's going to kill me for saying that.  Hey, man, I would never admit it on the air, but if Michael Jackson came around, I'd see  him, because he's like an icon from our era.  Now, see, that's a show I wouldn't even...  I can understand the whole icon thing, but why the hell would I want to go see Michael Jackson?  Especially now.  You know? 
[00:48:30]  You're going to support that guy?  You're a freak.  There's something going on.  I would like to see him just to see how fake his whole face is and stuff.  He ain't even going to get that close.  You got $50,000 to fork over for his little ticket package that he's selling?  50 grand!  $50,000!  And you're not even going to be able to see his nose that looks like it's going to fall off.  $50,000 for a package of 10 tickets, which, you know, that's... 
[00:49:00]  Let me do some quick math.  $5,000 apiece.  Yeah.  And you get to go backstage.  He'll sign a poster for you, and you could have dinner in the same room with him.  And you know he'll be, like, tucked away somewhere.  I'll tell you what.  With some young boy lucky man.  Wow!  William!  Warning!  Michael Jackson is coming, William.  Run for your life.  You'd fare better with Dr. Smith.  Buys his way out of that. 
[00:49:30]  You know?  Then he's always fighting with his family, his brothers.  Get this, son of a bitch.  $50,000 for five tickets.  For 10 tickets, whatever the hell it was.  And his brothers, two of the brothers, because they wanted to get the original Michael Jackson 5 up on stage.  Two of the brothers bowed out because they were going to pay him scale.  What they pay just the rest of the backup band.  Regular band.  Yeah.  And he's like, you know something?  Screw off.  Amazing.  Scale for his brothers.  Does he even help his family at all?  Hell no. 
[00:50:00]  Hell no.  We saw Jermaine Jackson at the WrestleMania.  Yep.  And it looked like he didn't have much money, man.  He was there with some of his kids.  They all had ratty clothes on and stuff.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, your brother has more money than almost anyone in the entire world.  I have to save it.  And he's hanging out with just the regular schmucks like you and I.  No bodyguards around.  No special section.  Everyone's bothering him like crazy.  And I'm thinking, I don't think his brother helps this guy at all.  I would like to help my family, but I might need the money to pay off some more alleged pedophilia affairs, allegedly, that I allegedly might have alleged that I have to do. 
[00:50:30]  I have to put more padding on the carousel at Neverland, because it chafes their little bare bottoms when I put them on naked.  Oh, God.  They sure don't pull off a ring when they spin around.  I'm standing in a platform.  Give Michael a couple of tugs and win a prize.  Doctor.  See, and then when I see the little child walk around, it looks like a cream puff went off in his face. 
[00:51:00]  He wins the prize.  A night to sleep with me, Michael Jackson, allegedly.  That I alleged.  Like a hot glue gun exploited around the kid.  Ugh.  I don't like chafing on the young bottoms in their tighty-whities.  All right.  So that Madonna concert was good, huh?  It was all right.  I got to get my ass to a Godsmack show or something to get the gayness out of me, though. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  Bring your whole body.  I need to get myself to a mosh pit.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, some good abuse on the instant feedback.  We have to take a break.  Hey, do we have some man-boob guys here?  Yeah, we got it.  Well, we got one, and we got two kids that, I don't know.  Thank God.  We weren't ganging up the place enough.  Hey, are we going to get Plenty on top here today?  I'm still waiting to see if she can come in.  Plenty up top.  The show has been waiting. 
[00:52:00]  Plenty up top?  Right.  Yeah, she's got like 128 triple Z.  And that's her name?  Yeah, Plenty.  What are the odds of that happening?  Up top.  How did they know when they named her?  We just need some hotness in the studio.  It's been nothing but man-boobs, Madonna discussion.  Sausage week.  It's been sausage week in here.  And Frank Caliendo.  Frank Caliendo.  That doesn't help matters.  Kakuta, Madonna.  Means no worries.  Come on, Opie.  Fly across me.  Come on, honey.  Bring it on.  I'm going to Uncle Arthur. 
[00:52:30]  Come on.  Sam.  Give me a little rip.  What were you doing yesterday?  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Flying Charles Nelson Reilly.  Oh, this show's getting manlier.  Charles Nelson Reilly was at the Madonna show last night.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah, he was.  Did he say, how's that for a topper?  Oh, oh, oh.  How's that for a topper?  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yes, their oak left them in the bathroom.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  She didn't play Lucky Star, that bitch. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, oh.  I like the old stuff.  Oh, oh, oh.  Jeez.  Wow.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Wow.  Boom.  Boom.  All right.  Break time.  Yeah.  Man boobs next.  Woo-hoo.  Great.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people.

[00:55:00]  Very funny guy.  Uh, Anthony, we're talking about bands and the stupid things they do to their hardcore fans.  Yeah.  Real fast before we move on.  Harry Sack writes,  Want to hear some F'd Up Concert S?  C.C. DeVille from Poison charges fans $5 for autographs outside each show.  He has a sandwich board set up next to him and security guards,  which won't let you speak to him unless you pay. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, my God.  Great.  There you go.  Throw one to the fans.  Nice.  By the way, I'm not alone.  And I don't know why Ben would tell me this during commercials,  but, uh, Ben will be seeing Madonna in Jersey over the weekend.  You know what?  I am just like you.  I, I, uh, I have no problem seeing Madonna.  I don't know.  Ben, but here's, now here's the question I gotta ask you.  Opie went.  It was a great, uh, I think a birthday present for Sandy.  Correct.  It was a great present. 
[00:56:00]  Ben, who are you going with?  I'm going with two girls.  Okay.  All right.  That's all I wanted to know.  You want to know what?  What?  I go to a lot of shows.  I have, I would just like to see her to see her.  I mean, that's, uh, it's an icon.  I could care less if I had gone or not, but there was an extra ticket, so I'll go.  Screw it.  I don't care.  There you go.  Maybe she'll do some of the old stuff.  No, probably not, but, you know, whatever.  I, I, I mean, whatever.  No, no, no, no, Ben, I just wanted to know if you were going alone or.  No.  Hey, um, little Stevie, who was here yesterday, he's one of our Man Boob contestants. 
[00:56:30]  Has everyone checked out the latest, uh, contestants from the Man Boob contest?  Go to opieandanthony.com.  There's some horrific sites to check out.  The voting's going to start Monday.  Today's the last day to qualify.  Rick is out there taking pictures, uh, of a few guys right now.  I went to the tumor.  Punched up little Stevie's tumor.  Oh, there's a, little Stevie's tumor's up on the website?  Yeah.  Turn it around, man.  Turn it around.  His, um, tumor's up there.  Let's.  Well, little Stevie's on the phone here.  Little Stevie. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Oh, God.  How do you like my tumor?  There it is.  That's a good shot of it right there.  Dear sweet heaven.  That's, that's great, little Stevie.  He carries it around.  He carried it around, uh, a picture of his, uh, tumor in a nice silvery frame.  It's beautiful.  So what's going on?  Everything is cool.  Listen.  Hey, yesterday, that guy, uh, George with the one movie.  Yeah.  He didn't want you to contact his girlfriend.  Yeah.  And he was, he was actually putting up a pretty decent fight about how he couldn't get in touch  with her and all that stuff.  Yeah, we wanted to call his, uh, his current girlfriend to give her the bad news. 
[00:57:30]  Well, sure enough, he's outside talking to her, telling her that he's at the station  enjoying himself, having a good time.  I'll tell you about it later, he says to her.  He's on his cell phone telling her this.  I knew it.  Bastard.  Hey, Stevie, why don't you tell us that when he was doing it, you tool?  I was on my way out the door.  You got this.  I had to, I had to catch the train at Penn Station.  You could have helped us out and tipped us off.  That would have made for some great radio.  Yeah.  Well, I'll do it a day later.  I'm sorry.  All right, man. 
[00:58:00]  Thank you.  You know, that explained a lot of things at Penn State.  Uh, Penn, what's going on?  It is a tool box.  That would be Anthony.  Yeah.  You guys see a lot of messed up crap, but you went over the line this time, man.  Yeah, on the retard, um, stuff?  No.  What about when you were talking about Michael Jackson?  Oh.  I got all his stuff, all his CDs, all his tapes that he made, everything.  And what are you going to do?  You're going to ruin the stuff that he wants to put out in the future by putting that negative  energy around. 
[00:58:30]  Negative energy?  Hey, Ben.  What?  His latest album I hear is a disaster.  Awful.  That's why they haven't released it yet.  We have inside, we have some inside people that told us that it's a disaster.  Yo, I think he's the best performer.  I think he's the best singer.  Better than.  Uh, so we got Frank Caliendo in the studio.  Nathan Lane might be on the, um, on the phone.  Oh, this, remember we got a call from Nathan Lane before, and it was really him. 
[00:59:00]  But, uh, Stinky can't tell if this is the, the real Nathan Lane.  What, why are they talking to him?  Well, pop it down.  I can't, because they got to put him on hold.  Oh, put him on hold.  There he is.  All right.  Uh, Nathan Lane.  Nathan!  Good afternoon, boys.  That's not Nathan Lane.  You're not Nathan Lane.  That didn't even sound like it.  Love the show.  Love the show this week.  It doesn't even sound like the guy that called saying he was Nathan Lane, uh, last time.  A few months ago.  It's not you, Nathan.  It sounds really bad.  You should try to, you know, fag it up a little. 
[00:59:30]  Joel Stein.  What?  Joel Stein is the writer for Time.  Yeah.  That's who I am.  Oh, are you trying to make a joke?  And silence.  Make it three in a row, O.  Thanks for calling, Nathan.  Three hang-ups in a row.  Wow, the hat trick.  Okay, Madonna.  You know, I was going to show my, uh, my radio skills and, and seg into something, you know, 
[01:00:00]  real casual where you wouldn't even know the difference.  Right.  But I can't even think of a way to do it.  So, uh, Frank Caliendo does his pick.  Hold on.  I heard you guys were doing a Harry Carey thing a while ago.  What a segue.  There were some different guys doing a Harry.  I have my own Harry Carey thing that I thought I'd do for you.  You know, because guys, like, like, we've been talking about girls think weird, you know,  gay things too much.  So I thought, let's talk about two things that are guy things.  Baseball and video games. 
[01:00:30]  Wouldn't it be great?  Wouldn't it be really great if you combined those two things and made one thing?  Like, John Madden had his own video game.  I wish Harry Carey would have, but not a baseball game because that would have been too simple.  I wish he would have done play-by-play of Super Mario Brothers because that would have  scared the crap out of everybody.  Somebody record this character because it could be used later.  Anyways, here it goes.  How come Mario just ate a mushroom?  He's doubled his original size. 
[01:01:00]  He's going to go kick a Koopa Trooper's ass.  I'd hate to be a Koopa Trooper right now.  Hell, I'd hate to be a Koopa Trooper any time.  They're all green and slimy.  And is that, is that Opie Voguing over there?  And Mario, no, sorry, it's a man-eating plant.  Anyways, Mario just got to the end of the level.  You know how I can tell?  He just banged his little Nintendo groin on the flagpole. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, you might be seeing fireworks, but Mario's seeing stars.  Hey, that's the end of the bit.  Did you like it?  Let me know.  Hey, look at that.  Frank Kelly had done.  Yeah.  Pulling us out of a phone call wreckage.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Thanks for that.  There's one other thing that I always wanted to talk to you guys about before.  Yes, Frank?  I never, I love the Super Friends.  You guys remember the Super Friends?  Oh, yeah.  The greatest announcer of all time.  That guy would come out and go, 
[01:02:00]  Meanwhile, back at the Hall of Justice,  Aquaman prepares a peanut butter and jelly sandwich because he can't do crap.  And I watched, there's a couple cartoons that I was watching.  It was like Scooby-Doo.  I was watching the credits of Scooby-Doo,  and you guys know who did the voice of Shaggy, right?  Yes, it was Casey Kasem, right.  And he was also the voice of Robin in Batman and Robin on the Super Friends.  Right.  And you can tell,  because Batman and Robin coming on the crime scene,  and Batman's like,  Who could have done this?  There's Robin.  Look, Batman, there's a letter from the Riddler.  And he writes, 
[01:02:30]  Dear Batman and Robin,  It's been a long time since I last saw either one of you.  But while I was in prison,  I came up with the most diabolical plot of all time.  A plot to take over Gotham City and the rest of the world.  But I needed a partner.  Batman, because I'm the Riddler,  I can't tell you who that partner is.  But the answer lies in a song from 1976.  Hey, some people call him a space cowboy,  and some call him a gangster 11.  Hey, John Madden helping out.  It was actually 77,  but 76 sounds funnier.  Meanwhile, back at the Hall of Justice, 
[01:03:00]  Superman gets ready to explain his plan.  What we're going to do here, everybody.  They used to do that like,  Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom,  Lex Luthor plans to take over the world.  We're going to take over the world.  That's what I just said.  Giant Monkey Man?  Using Giant Monkey Man,  he tells Freeze Guy to do something.  Freeze Guy, do something, 
[01:03:30]  while Monkey Man is here.  It's like,  then it's like, again,  Meanwhile,  at a volcano,  Aquaman stands senseless.  What am I going to do here?  I know I can do an Aquaman.  You can do the Aquaman.  Meanwhile,  back at the Hall of Justice,  Aquaman summons a can of sardines.  This is going to make us a great sandwich,  Batman.  It's good, man.  Meanwhile,  back at the Opie and Anthony show,  Some people call me the space cowboy. 
[01:04:00]  Hey,  Some people call me Maury.  Yeah.  Lou,  what's going on?  You're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey,  what's up?  Did you know that Frank Colleander just did a Ted Knight impersonation when he was doing the guy from Super Friends?  Actually,  actually,  Sugar Ray,  that was not a Ted Knight.  Ted Knight used to do the ones with Wendy and the other guy. 
[01:04:30]  It was not the Wonder Twins episodes,  which were the better ones,  where they went,  that thing.  That was a different guy.  The first ones were,  Meanwhile,  back at the Hall of Justice,  Superman changes his cape.  Okay.  But then it changed it.  But it actually changed a different guy.  Meanwhile,  the Wonder Twins are touching Gleek.  Ted Knight,  always funny.  I saw Ted Knight in an old Twilight Zone episode.  I saw him last night.  I didn't even know it was him. 
[01:05:00]  In a dream.  See?  I didn't even know it was him.  Really?  I'm looking and I'm like,  that guy looks familiar.  He's back from the 50s,  you know,  and he was,  you know,  strapping,  very young at the time,  and he's walking around.  I didn't know it was him until he talked,  because the voice didn't change.  Let's get back to the spaceship.  He plays an astronaut guy.  Cosmic Cow.  We're out of supplies.  Lou.  Cosmic Cow.  Cosmic Cow.  Monroe. 
[01:05:30]  Get away from my daughter.  Look at the rainbow in the apartment.  Sean,  what's going on?  How are you?  Hey,  good.  You're on the radio.  Let's go.  Oh,  really?  Yeah.  How'd you guys like to say?  Oh,  you sent in the Flintstones.  Right,  right.  We were watching this in the office,  laughing our asses off the other day.  This guy put a new dialogue to a Flintstones episode,  the one where he was the golden smog,  and he sang,  well,  when the saints go marching in,  hey,  when the saints,  but he overdid all the talking with the real potty mouth stuff that Fred and Barney and 
[01:06:00]  Wilma and Betty were saying,  and it was really funny.  We got to get maybe a clip or something up on the website.  Yeah,  I wanted to send it in a while ago,  but,  uh,  it's hilarious.  I thought you guys wouldn't like it.  Did you do the tape yourself?  Yeah,  me and my cousin did it.  Good fake Fred.  No,  that was,  I knew you would have used that.  Good fake Fred,  and,  uh,  Wilma sounded like Fred,  but it was good.  It was really funny.  We were laughing pretty hard.  The Barney was good.  You can put that up on the site,  maybe,  uh,  yeah,  we can put a clip up on, 
[01:06:30]  uh,  foundrymusic.com.  Ask Stinky if he still has a tape.  It's got like Wilma,  uh,  telling Fred and,  uh,  Betty telling Barney that they're going to give him Hummers and stuff,  but in really graphic language.  Yeah.  You like the part where he turned into the magician?  I like the part where,  uh,  I,  I think it was,  uh,  Fred calls,  uh,  Wilma,  see.  Oh,  yeah.  Broke the egg in the sand.  Steve,  can you put this up on the,  on the website?  Anthony.  Yeah,  sure.  Just send it in.  Yes.  Well,  no,  Stinky's got the tape.  Oh,  we'll put it up sometime this weekend, 
[01:07:00]  Sean.  It's really good stuff worth,  uh,  checking out.  All right,  cool.  We'll put some quick clips up there,  right?  Sounds good.  All right,  man.  Later.  Ooh,  we invented the internet.  Uh,  John,  what's going on?  Yes,  you guys have something against gay men?  Uh,  why?  Oh,  John's calling from,  I mean,  I just don't appreciate the way you talk about,  about,  about homosexuals and Madonna.  Are you being,  so what?  So,  so,  so that's how they were at the Madonna show.  That's not how everybody is. 
[01:07:30]  I didn't say that,  did I,  John?  Well,  let me ask you something.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  John,  are you being,  uh,  for real?  Are you making a fake gay voice?  Uh,  no.  No.  No.  No.  All right,  go ahead,  John.  Is there something wrong with my voice?  No,  it's just,  if it's not an authentic call,  we'd just rather hang up.  John's a little faggy.  Yeah.  I've,  I've heard faggier,  though.  So,  what's the problem?  What's the problem?  Go ahead,  John.  Well,  no,  I mean,  you're talking about gay men as,  I mean,  not all gay men dress like that. 
[01:08:00]  I didn't say that.  No.  Well,  everybody is saying that,  um,  I mean,  Madonna,  there's,  there's,  you're,  it was a very,  it was a very gay,  gay room last night.  That's all I'm saying.  It was,  it was very gay.  There were other guys walking around hand in hand and arm in arm,  but I'll say it.  I,  you would never know they were gay if you saw them on the street separately.  That is.  But then there were,  over the top guys wearing like Madonna clothes and Madonna halter tops and stuff.  You know,  I don't do that. 
[01:08:30]  That's fine.  I didn't say every gay guy does.  Okay.  It was just a,  it was a very gay room.  You a top or a,  you a top or a bottom,  John?  I'm sorry.  Are you a top or a bottom?  Bottom.  Oh,  how's that for a bottom?  Definitely bottom.  Oh,  wow.  He's a piazza.  Yeah.  You're,  um,  easy.  He likes,  uh,  well,  you know,  you like receiving.  Um,  yes and no. 
[01:09:00]  Giving is all right.  There's nothing wrong with giving.  John,  no offense to you,  but this show has been really gay this week.  And you're really putting it over the top.  And usually we,  you have the man boobs.  I understand.  And usually we would go with this for a while,  but I just know we have reached the gay quota for,  for this show for this week.  So I mean,  you call us another day when we're really into the hot lesbian sex all around us,  just to even things out.  Okay.  Okay.  All right,  John,  but you got to listen closely.  I didn't say that everyone was over the top gay there.  It was, 
[01:09:30]  but it was a very gay place yesterday.  My question to you is,  is Sandy a guy or a girl?  Because I know a lot of guys named Sandy.  My girlfriend's beautiful.  It's Rick's sister.  Ah.  That's almost implying Rick is beautiful.  Oh,  God.  And I would agree with that.  My girlfriend's beautiful.  It's Rick's sister.  Why would that apply?  Because it's like,  it's almost like you're,  you're justifying her beauty by saying that she's Rick's sister.  God,  dude.  Well,  thanks,  Hope.  First of all,  they don't even look like their brother and sister. 
[01:10:00]  Thank God.  Imagine if that popped in your head during anything going on.  Oh,  Rick.  I just want to say that I've listened to your show since the first time you guys came on in Philadelphia.  Yes.  And you guys are doing an incredible job.  Thank you,  John.  Thanks.  Thank you very much.  Are we fabulous?  We love our gay listeners.  Bring on the next stripper.  Referring to the article.  Very good.  Time article. 
[01:10:30]  I got to get it.  I got to see that too.  I don't ever,  I don't ever read.  Oh,  the time article.  Yeah,  it was pretty bad.  I've never bought a magazine to read.  Really?  What do you do on the airplanes?  You don't read.  Work on voices.  Really?  That must be great for the people next to you.  Here's a Tom Green deal with this.  You really don't read that much?  Not taught.  Well,  not anything like,  yeah,  worthy.  I'm a,  I'm good.  I like reading magazines.  Like,  I don't pick up a book. 
[01:11:00]  I can't stand reading,  like,  novels.  Yeah,  I can.  But I have stacks of everything from swank to popular mechanics at all.  A lot of reading going on at swank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  Swank.  Anarchy.  Anarchy.  What's going on?  I'm listening to you in Delaware.  I'm listening to you in Delaware.  You're listening from Venus?  I'm so,  I'm so,  call back.  Your phone really,  really sucks.  He says he really hates us,  but the,  the,  the bit you were just doing.  Super Friends?  The Super Friends was winning him over. 
[01:11:30]  Oh,  look at that.  Almost had him.  Meanwhile,  on the Opie and Anthony show,  things get a little crazy.  That was the worst sound effect ever.  How do you get,  hold on.  It was kind of like a,  It was like,  You almost had the Jetson's car.  Yeah,  it was the Jetson's car.  Oh,  okay.  I should have told you what I was doing.  Okay,  Janie.  All right,  look,  this is my,  uh,  Super Friends sound effect. 
[01:12:00]  Uh,  uh,  uh,  uh,  All right.  Uh,  Opie.  Wow.  Wow,  that's pretty good.  You sounded just like it.  Dear sweet heavens,  that was awesome.  Thank you.  I can't believe you pulled that out of your own larynx.  I think I just popped something in my brain.  Something's good.  Yeah.  Much better visually than on the radio.  I hope we turn the dial down.  That,  that'll be better next time.  Are you going to do Chris Farley on Mad TV?  Wouldn't that be fun? 
[01:12:30]  No,  yeah,  because the visual is unbelievable.  Well,  Opie,  let's just say,  how's that for some radio?  That wouldn't you over,  Super Friends guy?  Huh?  Are you liking that one?  Meanwhile,  back at the Hall of Justice,  I take off my pants.  Huh?  Dear sweet heavens.  Meanwhile,  back at the Hall of Justice.  I was never a big fan of those cartoons,  though,  because the animation was so bad.  like you'd go back 
[01:13:00]  and Robin's missing a leg or something.  That rocked.  That was the best cartoon.  It was the,  no,  the animation was the least possible work  they could do  and make it work.  But that was all of Hanna-Barbera.  They would take all the characters  from Scooby-Doo  and just put those characters  in different clothes  on different shows.  Like,  that car show,  what was that,  Wonder Buggy or something like that?  Speed Buggy.  Speed Buggy,  yeah.  Speed Buggy,  right.  Speed Buggy had like Fred,  but he had brown hair.  All right,  that's not Fred. 
[01:13:30]  He's got brown hair  and shaggy shave.  These actors are getting a lot of work.  They would do like,  you watch the old Warner Brothers cartoons,  animated,  it's an art,  you know,  they really did a great job.  And the only thing  that was matted or flat  was the background,  usually.  They would just animate  the whole character.  And then you'd watch Super Friends  or any of the 70s cartoons  where they just gave up  and the actual,  the whole character  would just be a flat drawing  that didn't move.  And if the mouth had to move,  that's all that moved. 
[01:14:00]  And Robin had no eyes.  Yeah,  no eyes.  They didn't blink.  They didn't move.  And you'd see their,  if their arm had to move,  it was a completely different color  than the rest of them  because it's a different drawing.  Because the show  was all about plot.  Was that what it was?  It was.  Meanwhile,  thank God  the storyline was there.  They spend money  on voice talent.  They're winning  that caddy tournament.  That's what's important. 
[01:14:30]  She got a free ball  of super that head  or what?  You're no gentleman.  Hey,  I'm no doorknob either,  all right?  Hey,  oh,  that's what I always say  with him  is all just names  because that's a pretty much.  But he would do it.  Mary,  Lou,  Jackie,  Sarah,  Monroe. 
[01:15:00]  That's the breakdown  of tonight.  Jackie,  Sarah,  pause,  Monroe.  Monroe.  Our friend  Frank Caliendo  in the studio.  He's going to be on  Mad TV.  That's really exciting.

Mike, what's up today?  Yo.  Hey.  I have to admit, I heard you guys the first day, and guess what?  What?  Ask everybody else.  I love you.  You're like, I'm from Philly, okay?  And you're like the, you're the best thing on the radio. 
[01:18:30]  Seriously.  Better than any other rehash.  Play over and play over and play over to you bleed out.  Look at that.  Like this from day one?  That's odd.  Yeah, that is odd.  No, no, no, no.  I don't, no hate mail.  I mean, no, no hate mail.  Don't even consult the other personalities.  This is a required taste.  Or a choir.  A choir.  I mean, seriously, you guys are like my uncle.  But then it becomes required.  Right.  I'm such a douche today.  Thank you, Mike.  No, keep it going, man.  Seriously.  Love you guys. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  And by the way, I like the Has-Ban Corner.  That's Sing Rock.  What, Mike?  Has-Ban Corner.  What?  Yeah.  Has-Ban Corner was so cool.  Yes.  I'll see you.  Awesome.  There goes Mikey.  Yeah, why don't you try a little harder to sound like us idiots?  Stupid.  You know, Ted Knight was a lot of voices for cartoons. 
[01:19:30]  He was the narrator for Super Friends.  And the Batman, Superman Hour.  He was the narrator, Commissioner Gordon, Penguin, and the Riddler.  Oh, no.  Ted was on to something.  I love that one.  Well, I guess we've got to check out some man boobs, Anthony.  It's the last day to qualify for the contest.  Thank God.  Monday, the voting begins.  Why are you rubbing your hands here like you're really into this, Jim?  It hasn't really been a gay show, you know? 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Not enough.  It's been fag week.  A lot of straight guys go to Madonna and Fire Island in Providence.  No, we don't.  I see Ozzy.  It's the only show I go see.  Yeah, next week we're going to have to go the other way big time.  Yep.  Girls everywhere.  Because, I mean, we're turning people onto the show every day.  Imagine if they started listening this week.  And then whenever the girls call up and say we don't do anything for the ladies, now we can say we did.  Way back in 2001. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Anthony, yes, we're doing the man boob contest for fuller hair, a thinner body, and a fresher look.  See, Dr. Gregory Pistone.  He's in Philadelphia.  And he gets rid of these man boob things all the time.  God bless him.  On our website, www.drpistone.com.  Rick, you have the weirdest sneeze, man.  Also sponsoring this is goldenpalace.com.  When you vote on the man boobs, you'll have a chance to enter for a trip to Hedonism 3.  We've got three more guys in the studio. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  Well, step up.  Somebody step up to a mic.  Now, what's your name?  Henry.  Henry.  How old are you?  10?  17.  You're 17.  You weigh 40 pounds.  And there's no way you have man boobs.  Rick, does he have man boobs?  No, not at all.  No.  Here's a prime example of someone that just wanted to come up to hang out.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  So we don't have to ask you to take your shirt off, right?  You have nothing.  Anyone that tell you you look like Short Round from Indiana Jones?  Right?  Right?  People tell me I look like the guy from Goonies.  Well, that's the Short Round.  That's the same kid.  Is it?  Yeah.  But then you never saw Indiana Jones?  No, never.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Rent it.  It's a good movie.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  How many older rich men have offered you money just to rub their mules on your washboard abs?  The first one. 
[01:22:00]  God damn, Norton.  Shorty.  Chow-chi.  Chow-chi.  Remember that?  Told him to hold on to the bridge rope before it snapped.  I'll see you in hell.  Shorty, get the car.  No, huh?  Nothing ringing a bell?  You look just like Short Round.  No, huh?  Nothing ringing a bell there.  Fortune and glory.  Dr. Jones.  Say, Dr. Jones. 
[01:22:30]  Yes, Dr. Jones.  There you go.  Dr. Jones.  I just want to know what the Smashing Pumpkins are doing now that they broke up.  Ah.  Another one.  Well, I still don't think you have man boobs.  No, I'm not even going to ask him to take his shirt off, man.  No, we're going to have to put the kibosh on that.  What's the matter?  Getting a little too stimulated, Norton?  Don't make him take it.  You can easily pass for nine.  All right. 
[01:23:00]  If he takes his shirt off, that could mean he was asking for it.  Hey, we got that Colin Powell tape.  Oh, yeah.  The Colin, the whatever.  We have the Colin Powell tape from Vietnam where he sings, um...  Look at me with a segue.  His own rendition of El Paso.  You know that song?  Down in the West Texas town of El Paso, I fell in love with a Mexican girl.  And it's a whole story about a guy who rides into town, gets shot, blah, blah, blah.  It's an old Western song from, like, the 60s.  And he did his own version about a Vietnamese girl. 
[01:23:30]  And he sings it with some Vietnamese people.  Because apparently we're all friends now with Vietnam.  Apparently no one really cares that they're digging tunnels and putting punji steaks into Americans.  But, you know, enough time goes by again.  It doesn't matter.  So he's in Vietnam and he's singing this song.  But he's singing it to this Vietnamese woman who, I swear to God...  Now, you want to get in a hot-looking Vietnamese woman, that's fine.  You know, like the one from Full Metal Jacket. 
[01:24:00]  I love you a long time.  I miss a horny.  Miss a horny.  Too beaucoup.  Too beaucoup.  You know, one of those.  But this woman, I swear to God, she's wearing the stereotypical hangy hat,  like the old railroad workers used to wear.  And she looked like the woman, the old woman from Platoon that got shot by Bond.  Spray it out of the back of her head.  That Bond shot.  Because she was...  You're a VC.  You're a VC.  You're a VC. 
[01:24:30]  You're a VC.  Stay out of this, Elias.  This ain't your show.  I love that.  And then the little kid's like...  It's going to sound like a Cox airplane.  You know, I felt bad and all, but I'm saying, shoot the kid.  I can't take the screaming.  Oh, that was a great blast to the head he gave her.  Right in a temple.  She just goes flying.  Oh, it was great.  It's through the whole village.  Do it for man.  He's laughing at you, man. 
[01:25:00]  Awful big teeth.  Looks like one of those drowning victims in the Houston tub.  The big tooth kid.  Oh, my.  Either that or Alfonso Soriano.  Just when we were down at the lowest possible level.  We go one step lower.  Picks up a shovel and digs it a little deeper.  But, yeah, he sang a song.  And he is not a black man.  No.  Colin Powell.  I don't think this is a surprise to anybody.  But this guy is not a black man.  And you can tell by his singing.  And here it is?  Yeah, let's listen to Colin Powell singing this. 
[01:25:30]  My love is strong and it pushes me onward.  Down off the hill to Felina I go.  Sing it, G.  Out in the West Texas town of El Paso.  I fell in love with a Vietnamese girl.  Vietnamese girl.  Ugh.  I would find me in Rosa's cantina.  Cantina.  He doesn't play in Felina Woodward.  Wait, wait, wait.  Is he the one that doesn't know the words?  I said, no, that's some Vietnamese guy helping him out. 
[01:26:00]  It's like one of those Japanese karaoke nights or something.  So, no, he's the guy that sounds like the white American guy.  He is not black.  No.  He can't even, like, he can't even sing.  I understand.  He's appearing with the Harlem Boys Choir.  They're going to be singing Marzit Oats and Dozie Dots and Little Lambs and Ivy.  He stinks.  Wait until they hit the high notes.  Blacker than night were the eyes of a monkey know.  Witnessing evil while casting her spell. 
[01:26:30]  This is Colin Powell.  My love was deep for this Vietnamese.  I was in love, but in Maine I could tell.  Sounds like Jay Moore at Far 9 the other night.  One night a lot of young cowboys come in.  Wild as the West Texas wind.  That's a good day.  A worse atrocity than the Ted offensive.  It's for me now, the girl that I love. 
[01:27:00]  Down with his hand to the gun that he wore.  My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat.  Some young stranger lay dead on the floor.  There he is.  Great.  Sounds good, right?  Out through the back door.  Enough of that.  There it was.  Vietnam.  One of the worst things ever.  Colin Powell singing.  Worse than 50,000 Americans dying in Vietnam.  What's that? 
[01:27:30]  Some heinous joke?  Colin Powell needed some soul food.  I can't believe it.  Get yourself some crack.  Do something for yourself.  Do something for your people.  Come on.  How about a good old nigger work song?  Oh, no.  I can't believe that got played either.  Unbelievable.  Opiate Anthony.  I'm surprised that guy wasn't standing there.  What the hell was that crap?  Sing us a song. 
[01:28:00]  A good song.  How about the Camptown Ladies?  He's singing El Paso.  What did he think?  No cameras were rolling?  I heard you people try to get a little crack late, not to jump around like a bunch of Kansas  city faggots.  All right.  Well, we got two more man-boob guys to get through here.  The first one just wanted to hang so we didn't have to check out anything, thank God.  What's your name, man?  I'm Chris.  Where are you from?  Brooklyn. 
[01:28:30]  Brooklyn.  Yeah, representing.  He's all serious and stuff, Frank.  Man, he's got a hat.  Represent.  He's nervous.  You got the bad man-boobs?  No.  Well, there are.  Let me show you.  Well, you got some A's there.  Did you have to tweak them?  I mean...  Yeah, he's tweaking them.  Like this isn't gay enough?  I'm working them.  He's working them.  He's tweaking.  A little lip-licking and tweaking.  Now, that looks like something that might be able to just be worked off at a gym.  You too lazy? 
[01:29:00]  Well, the people will vote.  But you look at some of the pictures on the website, man.  The guy that was cupping his own D-boob.  That's a favorite.  I didn't see the one guy.  What?  The one boob?  Yeah.  I didn't see that one.  Amazing.  I heard he's really just a mess.  Absolutely amazing.  Here it is, Norton.  Take a look.  Come over here.  Come over here and take a look.  Half man, half woman.  Look at that, huh?  Look at that, right?  How weird is that?  He has one man-boob.  It looks like a bad influence.  He should tell his new girlfriend that his real name is Olivia Newton-John and cancer  ate the other one. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Holy smoke, Norton.  I've never been in here with Norton before.  This is wonderful.  Oh, isn't it a great experience?  I can't wait to see your Christmas special.  Wait until he threatens to throw a cup of AIDS on somebody.  He threatens that when he gets annoyed at people.  Frank is getting really uncomfortable.  I'm taping my Christmas special this weekend at the Stress Factory.  545 Ha Ha.  Someone should spray you with a fire hose full of AIDS. 
[01:30:00]  I like that one, too.  Yeah.  You're a Magic Johnson line, though, man.  I've been saying it all week.  Thank you.  Someone told me you called me that.  Thank you very much.  I didn't hear it.  It didn't get the justice it deserves.  Well, everybody was trying to get him to get on Sandy Cain when she was in here.  Right.  And he said he would rather...  What did you say?  He would rather than hug Sandy Cain?  Oh, no.  Garrett was hugging her.  Yeah.  Garrett Morris was hugging Sandy Cain.  Something along the lines, I'd rather roll Magic Johnson and barbed wire and then hug him. 
[01:30:30]  It was something along the lines.  I don't remember exactly.  It had an AIDS implication, though.  Right.  People's humorous every time.  Sure.  And who are you, bro?  Don.  Don?  Don.  Don.  Don.  Don.  Don.  Don.  Don.  Don.  What's up, Don?  Where are you from?  Trenton, New Jersey.  Trenton.  Representing.  Representing.  Trenton.  I saw him without his shirt off.  Now, this guy is going to be in the running.  Is he?  Huh?  They're perky.  Oh, well.  What is that Echo shirt?  That's the one you speak in between them.  That's what you get back. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, there you go.  Oh, is that what that means?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get that awful little...  All right.  Let's see the man boobs.  Yeah.  All right.  Not bad.  Yeah.  Just seeing it.  You don't have to move them.  Yeah.  We guys feel like they got to move them around.  Holy ass.  Look at the side.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And, dude, they're not perky, though.  No, I understand, though.  No.  They're drooping toward the floor.  The nips are south of the equator, which means droopy. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  That's like a lady that had breast implants, and now she's like 55 years old.  Yeah.  It's kind of firm, but the whole thing is like...  On top.  Lowering.  Lowering.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Well, that's quite impressive there, Don.  I like the chicks that get the implants, and they take their shirt off, and the nips are  going like Marty Feldman's eyes.  You ever see that?  Like, you're sitting at the strip club, you're nursing your beer, and you're ready to leave,  and then you see the new dancer come walking through the door with her bag, and she's going  that, and you go, I got to stay, because I got to see this now. 
[01:32:00]  A new girl.  Got to see the new one.  So she looks all hot, she's got big boobs, and then she comes in, gets up on stage, she  takes her top off, and you're like, holy smoke, what happened there?  They're going each which way.  That's classic.  Hey, baby Ray Ray's got to feel up the man boobs.  That's been your job for the last week.  That's correct.  Look at the crack.  What?  What?  What do you think?  Pull your pants up, man.  Rachel.  I don't need to see the...  It's not a man ass crack contest. 
[01:32:30]  That was the Madonna show last night.  We've really turned the show around for me.  Yeah, we sure have.  It's more fun for me.  Baby Ray Ray, why don't you fill up the man boobs and tell us how they feel?  Oh.  Are they womanly?  Oh, they're not manly.  Do they feel womanly?  A bee cup.  Yeah?  Yeah, definitely.  No, no, no.  I have Nazis.  Definitely Nazis.  They're a bee cup.  Full B's.  I say full B's.  Look at that.  Full B's?  It's hard to tell on a guy, oh. 
[01:33:00]  I don't know.  I shouldn't be getting an erection watching this, but I am.  Oh.  There's something weirdly erotic.  Yeah, right?  It's her judging and criticizing.  It's not from his part.  Humiliating.  Yeah.  It's fun to watch her, but then it stops.  Yes.  It's fun, no.  Now it's not fun.  It's not supposed to be fun, I guess, from the male perspective.  No.  All right.  Just to watch you doing it, though, is nice.  Well, guys, nice.  Guys, thank you.  Take off your shirt.  Their pictures will be up on opieandanthony.com. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  I could be in this contest, too.  I refuse to remove my shirt.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's awful.  It's awful.  We should take a break to catch up here.  Yeah, let's do that.  And, yeah, you know, we'll be back.  Our number, 866-2774.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Karen Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a pipe than listen to those things.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony Sam Adams. 
[01:34:00]  Look at the beautiful amber hue of this beer.  Look at it.  See?  And, look, today it's actually a Sam Adams bottle.  It's always a Sam Adams bottle.  That's right.  Sam Adams.  But today it's really a Sam Adams bottle.  They've taken beer to the next level.  It's not a watered-down beer.  This is an award-winning beer.  That's right.  We love it.  Our fridge is packed.  You know what happened today during the in-between shows, Ron and Fez and us? 
[01:34:30]  Fez comes in and goes, can I borrow a beer from you?  I go, okay.  I'll take one out of the fridge.  And what did he grab?  A Sam Adams.  Look at that.  He grabbed an empty bottle.  I don't know what he was going to do with it.  No, it was a full bottle, of course.  Because everybody here loves Sam Adams.  Pick one up.  Or if you're at the bar, buy around for your friends.  It's Sam Adams.  The award-winning beer that I'm drinking right now.  And you can, too.  Sam Adams.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony. 
[01:35:00]  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  And we're back with the O&A show.  Frank Caliendo in the studio playing Rascals tonight and tomorrow.  West Orange tomorrow.  Ocean tonight.  Ocean tonight.  Jim Norton is playing Stress Factory.  Look at this.  Dueling comedians.  Dueling plugs. 
[01:35:30]  Dueling plugs.  That is the movie.  I'm going to be a rascal.  I'm going to be a rascal.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Okay.  Okay.  It's going back to what we were saying with Plenty Up Top.  I must say the studio is getting less gay right now.  It's a comedy club.  It's a club with comedy in it. 
[01:36:00]  In Superman's world and Krypton, the big red one was the sun.  The big red one was the sun.  Krypton had a red sun.  The yellow sun gave Superman his powers.  Had powers on Earth, but not in his own world of Krypton, which exploded.  And then the godfather sent him away.  He woke up.  His planet's blown up.  He woke up.  He went, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, God. 
[01:36:30]  I'm going to have to move to the other side of the state.  Planet's blowing up.  I've done nothing.  It's getting less gay in here.  Thank God.  And the smell's coming back to the room, which is nice.  Yeah.  You smell real good.  Plenty up top.  I thought you were talking to Jamaican Mike, who just walked in, too.  Hey, I'm on.  Yeah, I'm on.  I'm fine at the back, guys.  Thank God Jamaican Mike's back, because I was ready to give the biggest FU for FU Friday  today to the parking garage downstairs. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  You know what happened?  What's the matter?  What happened?  It says, oh, Jamaican Mike, we don't like the way the place is running.  Yeah.  You know, we're taking over the Park Central Hotel, so we're going into a different direction.  A different direction.  So they kind of transferred Jamaican Mike.  Out of there.  For like a month.  You know what was bad?  Jamaican Mike worked downstairs in the parking garage, and any time anyone locked their keys  in their car, he could jimmy it with his own junk.  Nice.  Because he's Jamaican, and believe me, he's sporting a huge junk. 
[01:37:30]  And you see what happened?  A lot of complaints, a lot of problems.  Keys locked in car.  Can't find keys.  Can't find cars.  All over the place.  So you know what happened?  They got to send right back for me, man.  See, you're in demand now.  Nice.  See, it feels nice, right?  More money.  There's some job security there for you.  That's nice.  That's really nice.  Mike, my car on top.  Keys are readily available.  Everything is okay.  Thank you, sir.  It is nice.  Thank you.  I'm such an elitist now.  Makes the garage seem so safe.  That's a safe one.  Jeez, is it running? 
[01:38:00]  Is it good?  Ready to go right when I step in?  Thank you, Jamaican Mike.  I heard you got to wait like half an hour sometimes.  Oh, my God.  I would sit down there and wait on a huge line to get my vehicle.  You know, I commute.  I drive.  It's a pain in the air.  No, it is.  And if it's just a regular wait, that's fine.  I'm in no huge hurry.  But when it's screw up after screw up that's keeping you there.  And then some black guy last night cuts in front of me online and just goes,  Yo, man.  Yo, man.  I just got to get this stamp.  I just got to get this stamp. 
[01:38:30]  I'm like, what?  He goes, Yo, I just got to get this stamp.  I go, all right.  I don't even know what he's talking about.  I've never heard anything being stamped.  He gives his ticket and the money.  And they put his car next to the line that he got.  And I'm sitting there going, You just did what I wanted to do.  Get my car.  You didn't have anything stamped.  I'm in a hurry, too.  Great move, though.  I got to use that one.  It was a good move.  Yeah, I got to get this stamp.  Just say something they don't understand.  It doesn't matter what you do.  You're online at a bank.  Walk in front of the guy and just go, No, I just got to get this stamped.  I got to get it stamped.  I'm like, all right.  What does that mean?  You just say something.  That's true, man. 
[01:39:00]  It works.  You say something they don't understand.  One time there was a black guy online, and I walked up, and I said, Employment.  And he's like, Huh?  Oh, my God.  You have balls.  You just said that in front of Jamaican Mike, who is gainfully employed.  He knows I'm kidding.  And could squash you like a bug.  He really could give me a savage beating.  He's not a black guy.  He's Jamaican.  I'm Jamaican.  That's right.  I'm in between.  It's different here in between.  But that's what the girls get when they go and leave the boyfriends at home and go on their  little trips to Jamaica, you get this.  They get this.  Jamaica.  Hi, man. 
[01:39:30]  And they love the boy.  Oh, you're so Caribbean.  I love him.  I'm here with my girlfriend, Cheryl.  And our boyfriends are home.  And we don't even have them anymore.  So, just unzip your pants and release the Kraken.  Release the Kraken.  We have a sound effect of a Jamaican guy releasing his stuff.  You want to hear it?  Yeah, this is actual audio down in Jamaica with somebody's girlfriend right down there.  This is actual audio. 
[01:40:00]  And here's what happened.  And how are you going to compete with that?  And we have actual audio of, I believe, an Asian guy doing the exact same thing.  Frank, would you like to hear this?  Yeah, I'd love to hear that.  Okay.  Vern Troyer?  Vern Troyer is in the Asian guy's pants.  Right.  Well, yeah.  Let me release my mini-me.  Yeah, man.  You're down here. 
[01:40:30]  I show you a good time when you're away from your boyfriend.  Loving it, man.  You love that so much.  Yeah.  Oh, the music's playing.  They're drinking those drinks.  It's Jamaican guys working that voice and being all smooth.  Lots of pot. 
[01:41:00]  And you're up in New York or wherever you are going,  Uh, hi, honey.  Hi.  Hi, honey.  You having a good time down there?  Yeah.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole.  You sound a little out of breath.  Uh, what are you doing?  Oh, oh, oh.  I just ran from the beach.  I just ran from the beach.  Oh, oh.  All right, well, you have a good time, click. 
[01:41:30]  You Jamaican guys work it, man.  How many guys, Mike, how many girls go down there and get picked up by the Jamaican guys  when they're on vacation?  A lot of girls.  Sure.  You know, a lot of girls go to Jamaica for that reason.  What do you do?  Like, how do you do?  When you walk up to them, what do you say?  What's a little line if you see them on the beach?  What I said?  Yeah.  You know, I say, oh, hey, how are you?  What's going on?  You know, simple little stuff.  See, but it's got the accent, so it all about, oh, it's so Caribbean.  Oh, gush, gush, gush. 
[01:42:00]  Like, where you're from and stuff like that.  Oh, I'm from America.  I'm from New York.  Oh, yeah.  How's it up, dear?  You know, I'm like that.  Oh, before you know it, you're back in my hotel room.  God, you guys got a knock.  Jamaican guy sounds just like dice.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Good friends we have.  Good friends we have.  Oh, we got to help out Ben on line 11. 
[01:42:30]  Ben, what's up?  Hey, man.  I love you, but you're killing me.  What?  My girlfriend leaves tomorrow down to Bermuda.  You're killing me.  You know what's going to happen, dude?  I don't want to hear it.  She won't give you a hummer unless you put curry on your mule.  Guys, I told her about that segment you did a while ago.  Yeah.  And she laughed at me.  So you're going to listen to those guys?  I'll be fine.  Who is she going with?  One of her friends?  No, she's going with her whole family.  Thank God.  She's with her mother.  That doesn't matter.  That doesn't mean nothing, man. 
[01:43:00]  That doesn't mean nothing.  That doesn't mean nothing.  You know?  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  Tagging her, the mother, the father.  They don't care.  Call me now for your free banging.  Oh, I have the cards in front of me.  I'm picking up the cup cards, and the cup is full of man juice.  Shelly, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you? 
[01:43:30]  I love you guys.  Thank you.  Have you guys actually ever seen Jamaican's Junk?  Um, no.  Okay.  There is this great website.  I mean...  Oh, tell us more.  I'm serious.  It's going back to where it started earlier today.  No, you guys really have to check it out.  It's called Rudejams.com.  What is it called?  Rudejams.com.  Rudejams.com.  Yeah.  I mean, you guys have to check it out.  Jamaican Mike should know about this.  Does he know about that?  I know a lot of things, baby. 
[01:44:00]  I'll see.  Look at that line.  You'll probably see Jamaican Mike on it.  How do you spell this website?  Because we're not...  R-U-D-E-J-A-M-S.  Yeah, I think that's not a site.  Yes, it is.  You guys have to check it out.  All right.  We'll check it out, Shelly.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  But I'm not.  Ah, what a mess.  And it's all fun, you know?  Because they go down there, and it's not...  They don't have to bother with work or anything.  So they're just having fun and drinking the pina coladas and stuff 
[01:44:30]  and the frozen daiquiris on the beach.  And all of a sudden, these Jamaican guys walk around and just ruin it.  That's it, man.  Let's get it on.  Stretch them all out for the ride home.  That's it, man.  Let's get it on.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  About 10 years ago, I went to the Bahamas.  We had hooked up with these girls at this bar.  Me and my friend were hanging out.  There's a group of seven girls.  They start doing shots of tequila or shots of something.  Every black guy in a bar just...  Eyes gravitated towards them.  Ended up leaving with the black guys. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, they leave with the Americans.  Yeah, it was over.  They didn't go down there to hang out with guys from Jersey.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what they're getting away from.  They're getting away from your white ass.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, Mikey.  See you later.  Bye.  Scott, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  My fiance, Janice, she was down there like a bachelorette party.  Wait a minute.  It's a double whammy.  Hold on, hold on. 
[01:45:30]  Hold on two seconds, Scott.  Hold on.  The website just came up and...  Oh, my God.  It's horrific, man.  Holy...  What?  Guy.  Oh, my God.  And that's pushed down between stuff.  Oh, my God.  And the funniest thing, that one is dead.  Look at it.  That one is sleeping.  Look at that.  That one is sleeping.  You wait.  That one will smack him in the jaw. 
[01:46:00]  Your fiance, this guy's fiance went down there?  What the hell?  Holy smoke.  Oh, my God.  There are plenty of tops even saying, oh, my God.  That's even too big for my boobs.  I swear to God, you guys.  You know if your chick's been with one of those guys and she comes home with a sore throat  and she wasn't even doing oral.  Or if it sits on a chair and it disappears.  That is the sickest, man.  Okay, terrific. 
[01:46:30]  I'd have to pass out.  All right, Ben.  Let's go back to denting up all the women.  Denting up all the American chicks when they go down there.  You know, a lot of these white girls love that, though.  Yeah, huh?  Did you see him look at me?  See?  You know?  Hey, plenty up top is in the studio.  Yeah.  Enough about Jamaicans.  Come on, don't be jealous, oh.  Come on.  Take it easy, man.  It's only natural.  I want stuff.  It's natural.  You know, nothing fake about it, man. 
[01:47:00]  But plenty up top is performing, dancing, stripping.  What do you like to call it these days?  Yeah, about that.  I'm an exotic walker.  Exotic walker.  An exotic walker.  That's good.  Okay.  Like, I can't see my feet, right?  So, you know.  You're going to be at Flash Dancers this weekend?  Yeah, yeah, I'm at Flash this week, and if anybody else wants to see where I am, there's  my website, plentyuptop.com.  Plentyuptop.com?  Yeah.  Well, we're going to go right to the website right now.  Yeah.  Okay.  How big are your boobs?  You know, 127 triple P. 
[01:47:30]  127 triple.  After a while, do you guys just make up, like, sizes?  How could that be a real size?  It's centimeters, and the P is with plenty of right.  We do make them up.  If I were to actually go buy a broad, there are 34 triple H, which is still pretty big.  How would that sound?  You got a wrestler?  Triple H.  Yeah, she's got triple H on her.  Playtime is over.  Oh, nice.  Triple H, all right.  Do we get to see him?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  But you were busy with his, you know, his junk, so I was just waiting for sure. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, hey, hey, hey.  No.  Because I thought at three minutes, he might drop his drawers.  Oh, no.  Don't say getting busy with his junk ever again.  I thought for a second, you know, he was going to be, you know, bottomless in here, so  I was just waiting.  I want to drop my drawers for a reason.  I don't drop it yet.  Plenty up top.  We got Al Pacino in the studio.  We'll see what he thinks of your boobs in a second here as soon as we get to see him.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  You guys want to take pictures as long as I'm toddlers?  Oh, yeah.  Wait, where's Rick?  Oh, wow.  Holy.  Nice. 
[01:48:30]  Those are big.  They're big.  They're natural, right?  Thank you.  Great abs.  Of course.  Look what they're holding up.  Yeah, that's the important part.  Oh, nice.  What, do you work out at a gym?  Yeah, let's do it.  I think you get a six-pack.  I'll spot you.  I'll spot you.  I'll spot you.  You guys ready?  Is Al Pacino ready?  Yeah, I was ready.  Give me what you got.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Hello.  Wow.  You're going to do something with me, right?  I don't know.  I don't know what to do. 
[01:49:00]  Can you operate a camera?  Just sit there.  It looks like you're not part of this.  Uh-oh.  She's got body glitter on, too.  The universal tag of women.  Didn't Richard Branson try to circle the planet in one of those?  Those are freaking huge.  That's good.  No, I can't.  Pending litigation.  Pending litigation.  I swear.  Pending litigation.  If any pictures are taken.  Get away from me.  Give me a hand.  Take me.  No.  Get away.  Get away.  Last time, a chick with big cans came near me. 
[01:49:30]  She smacked me in the head.  No, I got body glitter on me.  Son of a bitch.  You know what?  You know what you do?  You say you were drinking Coors Light because, you know, it comes off of the bottle.  Don't put that up on the website of me.  I would like a picture, and you can put it on the website.  Oh, Jim Norton won't mind.  No, I don't care.  They're like two basketballs.  You'll have sex with you.  Two basketballs right on her chest.  I just used my camera, too.  Hey, man.  I'll get over there.  Plenty up top.  Does that hurt?  No.  No?  Not a bit.  Nice.  Hey, we got a flashlight? 
[01:50:00]  We can do the flashlight trick.  Oh, get the flashlight.  Get a flashlight.  Do you know where the flashlights are?  We have a great trick.  No one's here.  No one's here?  No one's here.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it is Friday.  No one was here since noon.  I know.  Thank you.  Oh, the flashlight trick rocks.  She puts a flashlight right underneath one, and we shut the lights out, and it glows like  a jack-o-lantern.  It's pretty cool.  We've seen it before.  It's nice.  Thank you, Trix.  All right.  Al Pacino, what do you think of the boobs there?  I could dribble them. 
[01:50:30]  Yes.  I could.  Don't we get a hoo-ah?  Hoo-ah!  Talk to me.  Nice.  That's awesome.  Go back and forth.  Feel like that little gay camera.  But you definitely feel less gay, though, now, right?  I mean, you were just a man through things.  I feel a lot less gay and a lot more intimidated.  Yeah, those are...  Well, you're just a little guy, Al.  I'm a big girl.  Flotation devices.  What kind of implants you got there?  I have, you know...  You got the bags or silicone?  What is...  It looks like it's silicone.  I have double-luminum implants. 
[01:51:00]  Aluminum?  No, double-aluminum.  Aluminum is what they're called, because it's one bag inside the other.  Wow.  Oh, that's good.  Double wrap it.  Yeah, yeah.  So they're super safe.  Looks like they implanted a human skull on each one.  A human skull would probably be lighter.  They weigh 30 pounds.  Each were...  Together.  Nice.  Together.  Again, I will say, they kind of look like those hiney-headed creatures from Star Trek,  the Menagerie.  Remember them?  And they were able to make you see everything, and they made Captain Christopher Pike's life  a lot better than he was in the wheelchair, just going beep, beep. 
[01:51:30]  Right?  I don't know.  I think they're great, though.  I'm really curious to see what will happen now with the whole J-Lo boob fascination thing.  Nice.  That's really...  That's disgusting.  That was gross.  Frank Caliendo looked over and just went...  That was just nasty.  What the hell am I looking at?  That's Woody.  He's our one-legged boxing champion, and he was just whacking his stump.  I'm going to be honest with you.  And we're not talking about the man jump.  I've been doing well until now.  Remember when I used to get...  That was...  I'm horrified now.  I think I'm going to have nightmares from that.  You're horrified. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, you used to get a little shaken up in here.  I used to get shaken, and for the last two days, I've been good.  Yeah.  And now...  You're getting battle-hardened.  But then you see Woody with his stump come in and start jerking on his stump.  That kind of put it over the top for you, huh?  That was really nasty.  Do you have a nice hiney, ma'am?  Do you have a nice hiney?  Norton.  Norton wants to know.  No, what I'm curious about, though, because this was, you know, the whole big boob thing  started, like, in the late, early 90s, you know, like, mid-93 through 90s. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, did?  No one like him to put it?  Everybody kind of went through.  No, it's just the whole giant thing, you know what I mean?  Oh, the giant boob.  There was just the big push, and there were all kinds of big boob features.  Jane Manfield was just a good actress.  Well, we're a whole lot bigger than she was, you know what I mean?  Like, we're these mega boob features or whatever.  There's about, you know, five or ten of us left.  But I'm curious with this whole big bottom thing, if all of a sudden you're going to see  giant ass implants, you know, and giant ass implants.  What's the deal with that?  You've got the J-Lo butt right on your chest there.  That's what I'm saying.  But I'm just curious to see if you're going to do that right now.  I wouldn't start buying stock in that or anything, because I really don't know people 
[01:53:00]  are going to go for a big giant ass.  I want to see a girl with, like, a giant implanted butt.  Oh, yeah, an implant ass.  That's a nice one.  Well, that sounds good.  Hey, giddy up, but I'm not sticking my face in there.  Plenty up top.  I've got to ask you, in all honesty, okay?  Sure.  I think you're attractive, but I'm not digging the big boobs.  I mean, do guys get really turned on by that?  Yeah, there's plenty of people that do.  I mean, I'm on the cover of the October issue of Gent right now.  I mean, you can go out on the street and buy it. 
[01:53:30]  I mean, you know, I've covered three magazines this year.  There seems to still be a pretty big market for it.  Right.  What are you going to do years from now when you're not dancing or not being a feature anymore?  Whatever you want.  But what are you going to do with those?  Are you going to deflate them?  I'm going to sell them on eBay.  What are you, crazy?  Oh, yeah?  But you can have them taken out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What will they do with the skin?  You don't want them hanging there, though.  Yeah, I think that they've got a new procedure now that they've been working on because, you know,  there's so many people that are getting reductions and whatever.  It's called a mastectomy.  Yeah, no, but there's just a new way of doing it so you don't end up looking really weird. 
[01:54:00]  And they laser your skin back down to your breastbone so you don't end up with the big pockets.  Holy smoke.  Lasers.  Crazy painful, but it's...  We got the flashlight.  That's what the inventor of the laser was really thinking when he invented the laser.  The flashlight trick is great.  It's not my bag, baby.  What?  You don't want to do the flashlight?  Oh, come on, please.  It's so cool.  Oh, it's so cool.  We won't take any pictures.  You just put it underneath and turn it on and we dim the lights and it looks really cool. 
[01:54:30]  Will it make you happy?  It's like a boobo.  That'll look great.  We'll give you another plug.  No, but it's got to be without the shirt.  Yeah, watch this.  Turn the lights off.  All right, turn the light out.  I can't...  Look at that.  Holy...  Let's see without the top, though.  No, it won't make a difference.  Yeah, I got to see the front.  That creeps me out.  It's like a boobo lantern.  Yeah, that creeps me out.  That creeps me out.  I'm going to get a Mark Ostroth face.  We did that on stage in front of like a couple thousand people.  It's a good trick. 
[01:55:00]  That's a good trick to bring it out.  I've never done that before.  That kind of creeps me out.  Yeah.  You could use that on stage.  No, that's not the kind of thing.  You want to get a reaction?  Do that on stage tonight at Flash Dancers.  Look at this.  Flash Dancers.  Flash Dancers.  I don't know how the reaction I'm looking for, I don't think.  All right.  No?  What's your clientele?  Like, what are the guys...  At Flash or around the country?  Yeah.  I mean, it's different.  Working in New York City, I mean, it's a rough room to work.  You know what I mean?  Like, everybody's seen everything, done everything.  I like working in the...  They haven't seen the boobo lantern.  Yeah, but, you know, I don't know.  I like working in places where they just go nuts. 
[01:55:30]  Everybody's there to have a good time, and they're screaming and yelling, and it's more of a party atmosphere.  You know, working in New York, it's always...  No, you'll have a good time, Flash.  You go on.  I've been there a million times.  I love it.  Don't get me wrong.  You have a boyfriend?  Actually, I was seeing somebody that one of y'all knows from Rochester not that long ago,  but I think that's kind of pissed it out.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Who were you seeing?  Scorch?  I'm not saying.  I'm not saying.  I'm not saying.  Yeah, Scorch.  Oh, you're not saying?  Well, do they always want to...  He's got a show in New Orleans.  In New Orleans?  Oh, I know who. 
[01:56:00]  Garrett Morris.  A black guy, right?  Garrett Morris.  No.  Ladies and gentlemen, Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris.  Ladies and gentlemen.  No, so right now I'm single.  I'm single.  Do the guys just always want their TF?  You look more like a double.  Do they always want a TF, though?  You know, not necessarily right off the bat.  If they've seen my films, they mean...  There's a word we can't say.  Oh, hey.  There's a combination of a couple of words we can't say when you put them together.  You could say Jamaican Mike got his job back at the garage downstairs. 
[01:56:30]  And you could say, hey, did you see the wind blow today?  But, you know, you take a couple of those words, switch them around, put them together.  No.  No.  Can't say.  Oops.  That's all right.  We got a dumb button.  Oopsie, oopsie.  That was a triple oopsie.  We got a dumb button.  The order was wrong.  Right.  Hey.  Did that on purpose.  Just say a hepatitis slurpee.  Again, that's something I just said, I don't know.  Holy ads.  Doesn't really suit my image.  Holy ads.  That's what they want first, though, because in your movies, you're pretty good at that 
[01:57:00]  one.  Yeah, I've seen my movies.  You're looking for a little of the oral.  We got to ask you another thing.  We know this other girl.  She could make her boobs bigger and smaller.  I can't.  I can only do that with surgery.  I can't.  No, I know, but...  She has valves under her armpits.  She has valves under her arms, and she could fill them up.  Like when she was sitting here, she could do that?  She goes home.  Does it at home.  It makes them bigger or smaller, depending if she has to see mom or not.  Because we all have valves.  I mean, there's valves in these.  No, she has the needles that she, like, sticks in her. 
[01:57:30]  It's pretty scarred up under her armpits.  It's, like, really sick.  She told us that, you know, it's not too cool to do this at home, but she does it at home.  And they're so big.  They're so huge on her.  I mean, that her armpit hair is growing on the side of her boob.  It has stretched the skin from her armpit to the side of the boob.  Frank Alienda looking a little excited when I said that.  Well, yeah.  Armpit hair on the side of boobs, hot.  Yeah, that's nice.  Yeah.  Hot app.  What a hot app. 
[01:58:00]  I think I work really hard to kind of have my own little niche of things going on.  Yeah, so do I.  I just shot for a muscle magazine not that long ago.  Because you work out.  I'm trying to do a whole bunch of different stuff and not, you know, be the same as everybody else.  I think Plenty Up Top is kind of a character, you know?  A character.  Yeah, she is.  She's kind of a character.  She's funny.  You know what I mean?  It's more.  She.  Yeah.  You're like a schizo when you say that.  But usually when you play a character, you can take the costume off.  Like, he's like, you can't move.  That's your plating thing is disgusting.  Yeah, that's kind of weird.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to jump on breasts that look like something Puerto Rican should be driving around with. 
[01:58:30]  Okay, terrific.  I love that Norton can go directly to a drink of coffee after that.  That's good.  Get sophisticated.  Got that one through.  I always know when he's going to say something really twisted because his eyes start getting weird and crap.  Just before he says it.  Weirder than usual.  I think I've seen you somewhere before.  What floor do you live on?  No, I think I saw you perform once someplace. 
[01:59:00]  Like at this comedy cellar somewhere in the city.  Well, I'm at the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow.  I just had a little set up there for a plug.  Yeah, no, I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before.  I think that's why you look for...  All right.  How do you sleep?  Do you have the holes in the bed?  By myself.  We talked to one girl.  She cut a big oval hole in her bed so she could lay on her stomach.  You know, I tend to think stories like that are just crap.  I don't believe it.  Really?  I don't believe it.  I think it's nonsense.  I sleep like everybody else. 
[01:59:30]  On your back, though, right?  I've been this size for five years.  I've had my implants since 91.  And before that, I was like 1,500 cc's, which is essentially a third of this.  But you can't sleep on your belly.  I can totally sleep on my stomach.  I wake up on my stomach all the time.  I think anybody that whines about it shouldn't have done it in the first place.  All right.  Tim, what's up?  We give it to ourselves.  We really don't have the luxury of being able to complain about it now.  It was a choice.  You know, my girlfriend's got 38 cc's.  I mean, they're pretty big.  They're great and everything.  They're nice.  But she can't stand them.  She can't buy clothes.  She can't, you know, she's really, like, worried about them. 
[02:00:00]  Like, I want to know, why would you make them even bigger?  Well, 38, she's kind of a big girl.  Well, yeah.  She's 38.  She's a big chick.  She's got a nice rack.  I'm just saying.  But, like, why would you make them even that much bigger?  She's making money.  Just for the pure fun of it.  Oh, yes.  For the pure fun of it.  I have had so much fun.  My career has been awesome.  You're getting paid pretty good money, though, right?  I'm not making bad money.  But I've had a lot of fun with my boobs, too, over the years.  I mean, they've opened a lot of doors, both figuratively and literally, over the years. 
[02:00:30]  I've had a lot of fun with my boobs, too.  They're fun at parties, man.  Hey, do you do boob tricks?  Because we had a girl, like, she was probably a little bigger than you, and she sprained my wrist.  Casey James?  Gave Anthony a concussion.  No.  Oh, I hated that.  Gave Anthony a concussion.  No joke.  Busty Hart.  Oh, I don't know.  One of the old timers.  Or she whacked you with him?  Yeah, she thought it would be funny to smack me in the side of the head with one of her boobs.  Knock me right off my chair. 
[02:01:00]  Nice.  Knock me off.  You got knocked the F out.  These slops.  These boobs were so hard.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, like a rock.  And then she goes, watch this trick I could do.  So she gets an empty Coke can.  Opie's holding the Coke.  She goes, now hold the Coke can.  Sprained my left hand doing this.  No joke.  So he holds the Coke can on the console and she takes her boob like it was a sweat sock  full of cement and starts smashing the can to crush it and hits Opie's wrist.  He just goes, ah, and like falls over in pain. 
[02:01:30]  We got video of that somewhere.  Yeah.  She's the one that was being sued because she does this bit where she puts a football helmet  on a guy at the club and then smacks the top of the football helmet with her boob and  she totally screwed up the guy's neck.  Nice.  He said, she hit me.  I didn't know it was coming.  I just heard a crack and now I can't move my neck.  Yeah, she went into hiding.  Didn't he wonder why he was putting on a football helmet at a strip club?  He kind of asked for it. 
[02:02:00]  If a stripper puts a helmet on you and comes into it with her boob, hey, that's like  getting out of there quickly is the best way to get going with that thing there.  That didn't make sense in the sentence, but neither does a football helmet in a big smashing.  That's funny.  Her breast paralyzed Daryl Stingley.  Oh, Daryl Stingley reference, though.  Nice.  We're plenty up top.  Thank you very much.  Oh, you guys, thanks for having me down.  I'm glad I could come down and do it.  Yeah.  Flash dancers, you must be doing a ton of shows, right? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, I've got shows tonight, 6, 9, and midnight tomorrow, 9, midnight, 1, 30,  2, 30 a.m., something like that.  I've got some choices.  Do I go see Jim Norton at the Stress Factory, Frank Caliendo at Rascal?  No, you come and get me, and then we split.  Or plenty up top at Flash Dancers.  That was the most subtle thing you've ever done.  Very tough decision here.  I don't know what to do.  I'm not even going to the Stress Factory now.  Yeah, Jim has just canceled his appearance.  All right, but thank you very much.  Oh, thanks, you guys.  I had a good time.  I appreciate it.

[02:04:30]  For the other cities, 866-2774.  Wow, you should write those numbers down.  Yes, keep them handy.  We love your participation.  Well, plenty up top is gone.  I remember when she was just as slightly getting bigger up to me.  I'm not feeling that big.  I said it to her face. 
[02:05:00]  I don't like it.  She's a pretty good looking lady, too.  Great body.  The bad friends are too big because they just look like volleyball.  It's freakish.  They're like two basketballs and they move like one entity, like it's a basketball dribbling.  They look like they're hard and just not natural.  I don't know what that is.  She'd be nice to go to bed with her.  She was a sexy girl, though.  It's just her vibe and her pretty lips and her little nice abs.  And her hiney was amazing.  And then it was a freak show, you know, on her chest. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  That's like a freak show.  I'd check that out not going, wow, that's hot.  I'd check it out because it's freakish.  There's no way you take those out and go back to just a normal boob.  It doesn't happen.  No, I don't care what kind of lasers you're pulling out.  All right, Anthony.  Well, let's get back into the gay zone.  Another guy here for the Man Boob Contest, the last day to qualify for this.  We've reattached the skin to the breastplate with a laser.  Laser, right.  Wow.  Laser.  Which was the original intention pointed out by Anthony earlier today. 
[02:06:00]  By the way, I should mention, for fuller hair, a thinner body, and a fresher look-see,  Dr. Gregory Pistone, he's going to give one of these guys a free procedure to get rid  of the man boobs.  Or the man boobs.  Or the one man boob.  Yeah, we do have one guy that has one boob.  He's out of Philadelphia.  His website's www.drpistone.com.  Also sponsoring this is goldenpalace.com.  When you vote on the man boobs, which will start Monday, you'll have a chance to enter  for a trip to Hedonism 3. 
[02:06:30]  Anthony, who do we have in the studio?  Oh, who is that?  What's your name, bro?  Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Where are you from?  Hey, Jim.  Long Island.  Long Island?  Mm-hmm.  What part?  Merrick.  Merrick?  Cool.  And obviously, you're here because you have the man boobs.  Yes.  And I guess we've got to see him now.  It's Friday because he has flames on his shirt.  Yeah.  That's a wacky shirt with the flames and stuff.  Yeah.  Okay.  Looks like the shirt the top guy on the bowling league would wear, you know?  Like the real, you know, and have a matching ball. 
[02:07:00]  Right?  With the fire on there.  Just missing the name on the shirt.  Yeah.  Is this your Friday happy hour shirt?  I just threw it on.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  I was thinking that's more the shirt they take off a guy who's been found smuggling child  porn in a duffel bag.  Hey, I don't know if this...  A Jets duffel bag.  I don't know if this is going to upset you, but what's up with the left arm?  Dialysis.  What?  Oh, he gets dialysis.  I'm on dialysis. 
[02:07:30]  What are all the lumps, though?  What happens is, like here is where they do a main hookup.  They take a vein in an artery and you hook it up.  So it's like a direct connection to your heart.  And what they do is they stick needles in there and they take blood out and filter it  out and clean it out and put it back in.  Is that a swollen muscle?  It's like a three and a half, three and a half, four hour procedure.  Wow.  No, what happens is over time, the vein builds up and gets bigger.  There's a vein?  Yeah, it's a vein.  It's a vein.  It's not like some people...  Jim, without making a joke, seriously, describe his arm. 
[02:08:00]  It's the arm.  It looks like...  There's obviously a reason for it, but it looks like there's like three lumps on it.  It almost looks like it was soft and somebody squeezed it and like the handprint...  Picture yourself putting a handprint.  Like, you don't understand, like if you squeeze something soft, like in a stretch Armstrong,  yeah, and the three like lumps.  From here, it looks like they put like rocks under your skin.  Do they have a normal use of the left arm?  Yeah, yeah, no problem.  That's unbelievable.  I've never seen that before.  If you feel like where they do the connection, you can feel the... 
[02:08:30]  You can feel the buzzing, how fast the blood circulates.  Wow.  Will they go away or no?  It's like a woman pleaser, you know?  You feel it like a vibrator.  It's like an arm of plenty up tops.  It's like a man boobs.  Yeah.  All right, let's see the man boobs.  Nice.  Nice.  You sure that's nice?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow, yeah.  And you decided to pierce one.  That one pierced.  You pierced one.  Why would you...  Why would you pierce it? 
[02:09:00]  You want to bring some attention to that.  Decide, you know what, this thing is...  That's a while ago.  I don't know.  All right.  Is this picture up yet?  No, not yet.  That's interesting.  Okay, yeah.  Sure, Jim.  What do you think?  Not bad.  They're there.  Yeah.  Where's baby Ray-Ray?  She's got to fill up the man boobs.  Oh, are you really?  I'm in the one with the piercing.  Ah!  Nice.  Hello.  Hi.  What do you think? 
[02:09:30]  Does it feel womanly?  That's like...  That's pretty big.  Yeah.  That's pretty jelly, actually.  That's jelly.  Like jelly?  Yeah.  Very soft.  Very big.  It's like a pillow.  How sexy is she?  Gosh, great.  Just pinching and criticizing.  You're next, Norton.  Love racial.  Norton will take his shirt off now if he's next.  I don't even say that.  Go ahead, Norton.  Come on.  Nah, nah, nah.  Aw, look, he's already sticking out his chest. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  All right, a little saggy.  That's a C cup.  That's about a C?  Yeah.  It's like a flat C, though.  It's like a pancake C.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They've got really small nipples.  I mean, that doesn't make any sense.  And this is so cute.  It's cute.  Yeah, he pierced more.  And a sound effect.  Barbell.  It's like, so it's a little piercing.  Does that feel good or does that hurt?  No, it feels good.  Oh, man.  Oh, he giggled. 
[02:10:30]  Don't wind it up.  They've always been like that since I was a kid, because I remember, my mother even said,  when I was in camp, like, one of the council was like, oh, go like this.  You can't say the T word.  Yeah, you can't say the T word.  But if your camp counselor made you push your breasts together with your biceps, you got  boogged.  Mike, what's up?  What happened next after you pushed them together?  What else did the camp counselor do? 
[02:11:00]  Tell us.  From what I can remember.  Was it your little secret?  From what I can remember.  The key is from what I can remember, because all of a sudden it was, I'm eating cotton candy.  This isn't really happening.  I'm at a circus.  It's all right, buddy.  We've all dissociated a few times with the man behind us.  It's cool.  Show us on the doll where he touched you.  Show us on the doll.  Did he touch you where your bathing suit covers? 
[02:11:30]  That's the greatest thing I've ever heard.  Let's have the guy put his flame shirt back on.  He feels really embarrassed and uncomfortable.  He's a cool dude.  Yeah, I like the guy.  He's all right.  He's all right, man.  Guys don't care.  Hey, why did the dialysis?  Why did dialysis?  Yeah, what's the main problem?  To stay alive?  No, I know, but what's the...  That's the point.  I mean, you want to go into details, it's just kidney failure.  It was called focal sclerosis.  It's like when your blood filters through the kidney, the holes got like scarred off, 
[02:12:00]  so it couldn't filter through it anymore.  Anything you did, like drugs or booze or anything?  They said it could have been a virus, like a strep throat virus when I had a lot of tonsil  problems, you know, before my tonsil was out.  Yeah.  A strep throat.  Wow.  So they said probably the virus from strep throat.  All right, cool.  I'm getting a little faint.  Will they go down if they stop doing it or not?  No.  No, they never take it out.  I mean, I had a transplant.  Oh, it's in there. 
[02:12:30]  I had a transplant.  What transplanted?  I had a kidney transplant.  Wow.  Yeah.  I had it for eight and a half years and just went into chronic rejection.  I'm back on dialysis again.  Wow.  So do you have any kidneys?  Technically, the one that they transplanted is there, and the original two are still there,  but they're like the size of a peanut.  You know, they shrink at the time because there's nothing going through it anymore.  Oh, my God.  So they just shrink.  Is anyone else getting that weird, tingly feeling in the undercarriage that somehow just comes 
[02:13:00]  about when you're really feeling?  I feel like I got to go to Rascals and Ocean Township.  I get some laughs.  Yeah, we got to get Frank Caliendo out of here.  He's playing Rascals tonight and tomorrow night.  West Orange tomorrow night.  Ocean tonight.  All right.  Everybody waiting for Norton to give a plug at this?  No, no, no, no, no.  I like that.  I'll do it later.  Yeah, he's got...  While you're on the road and can't talk, I'll definitely plug away.  I want to thank you for coming in, man.  Thanks.  All right, cool.  And your pictures will be up on the website very, very soon. 
[02:13:30]  See you, buddy.  He might be the last contestant for the Man Boob Contest.  We have an hour left.  We'll see what else shows up.  That's it?  Yeah, an hour left.  All right.  Let's take a break, and we'll be back.  Frank, thank you very much for the last two days.  Always a pleasure.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Mike, I can't do it later.  Have fun at Roscoe's.  Opie and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel out your sister, feel out your  sister, feel out your sister.  Opie and Anthony.

[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I came across here in New Mexico, out there in New Mexico, excuse me.  The coordinator of the Donna Anna County's Drunk Driving Prevention Program has been arrested  for driving while intoxicated.  Nice.  Bad enough, but it was at a DWI awareness picnic.  Police arrested Linda Harris, 53, on Wednesday in the parking lot of the park where the event  was being held. 
[02:16:00]  Several people working near Harris during the day told police they smelled alcohol on her.  She's at a DWI awareness picnic.  And then the police sergeant later saw her driving in the parking lot and smelled alcohol  in a breath, pulled her over, she volunteered to take a breath test, and she failed four  or five of five coordination tests.  As Harris did the coordination test, people gathered to watch thinking it was a demonstration.  She's hammered.  She starts doing the touch the nose, walk the line, and people are like, oh yeah, look, 
[02:16:30]  this is how it's done, I guess it's a, because it's a DWI awareness picnic, and she's the  coordinator.  She blew a .09, I guess .08 is intoxicated in New Mexico, and they hauled her away.  There you go.  Idiot of the week.  That's great.  Anthony, we have audio of Linda Harris.  Oh yeah?  Wow, I did a drink!  You're at the awareness picnic, you are the coordinator, there's cops around, and you're 
[02:17:00]  hammered.  The only thing that would have been funnier is if she barreled through the playground and  caused a few deaths.  Ouch!  There you have it, in our wacky little world.  They put a kibosh on her, huh?  How do you follow that?  I know, for the love of Eve, driving drunk.  Boy, oh boy.  Pipe down, you over there.  Pipe down. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, here we go.  Okie dokie, let's move on.  Oh, brother.  Oh, gosh.  We're going to try to get to...  Oh, my head hurts.  All right, we're going to try to do bit of the week before we get out of here, but we're...  Yeah, that's a good idea.  We're trying to get through a few more things.  You know, we forgot to mention yesterday that it was 10 years ago, yesterday...  Yeah?  ...that Pee-wee Herman went through that whole mess in the porn... 
[02:18:00]  Ah!  You know, this poor son of a bitch.  He had that very popular Pee-wee's Playhouse.  But he's doing well now, man.  Yeah, but how many years did he just take a vacation from his career while people didn't  give him work because he was the J.O. guy?  Well, he had a kid's show.  You can't be doing that if you have kids.  Absolutely not.  Soccer mom whores.  Hey, Terry, look!  I'll spank a bitch out on Terry!  Miss Yvonne, Miss Yvonne! 
[02:18:30]  You're the prettiest girl in Puppet Land.  So let me spank it to you!  Captain Carl, Captain Carl, join in!  Ah!  Ah!  Look, it's Mailman Mike with my new porno!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Conky!  Conky, I'll stick it in!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Don't dump.  I didn't say where.  Ha-ha-ha!  Captain Carl is dead! 
[02:19:00]  I forgot!  Yeah, that was...  What's his name?  Phil Hartman.  Phil Hartman!  Yeah.  And Jambi!  Jambi doesn't have hands, but I do!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Awful!  Ten years it's been already?  Ten years.  And he was watching?  Everyone remember the movie?  Uh, some nurse flick.  Naughty nurses.  Naughty nurses, right.  What volume, though, dude?  It wasn't a volume.  That was back when you... 
[02:19:30]  They just had one...  Well, wait a minute.  They had VCRs ten years ago?  Oh, hell yeah!  Yeah.  Like, fifteen years ago, it was pretty much...  That's right, he went to a movie theater.  He might have been on the road and not home and had his VCR.  Oh, is that it?  It certainly is.  Believe me.  You got the, um...  I was like his hometown, though.  It was his hometown.  I think he was staying with...  I think he was staying with Mommy and Daddy.  In Sarasota.  I guess you can't watch the porn at Mommy and Daddy's house, so you just...  Go get a magazine or something.  They knocked that building down, by the way.  Well, there's no more porno movie theaters. 
[02:20:00]  I remember going...  There's one in Asbury Park.  Really?  They were pointing out to us?  Yeah.  I remember going to, um...  Like, a porno movie in a movie.  I'm not going to say what kind of porno theater, because then I'm going to get, like, more abuse today.  Some of that gay porno.  I went to, uh...  There used to be a place in Bayshore.  I went to the Bayshore one in high school.  On the South Shore of Long Island.  Is that still there?  No.  But there's no more porno movie theater.  I mean, where?  Route 130 South. 
[02:20:30]  True.  So, in New Jersey, in Philly, this is no.  In Camden, it's Mecca.  All it is...  Really?  Is...  Yeah.  Is driving circles and bag-whacking theaters.  It's great.  There's only a couple of theaters.  A lot of booths.  And the theaters are actually pretty cool.  But the gay guys circle and look at you.  It's like...  It's like...  You feel like a gazelle, and there's lions watching it.  A tender, injured gazelle.  Yeah.  So, you get, like...  It's kind of hard to stay there for long.  You're like chum to the gay guys.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  New York gay guys don't like me, because they're all well-built.  But on the road, like the guys that are married, just, oh, they think I'm God. 
[02:21:00]  They really...  Nice.  Because I'm boyish, and I'm well-hung.  You know, I...  Because I...  Oh, no.  I'm just looking at the phone.  Remind me about the movie theater thing, though.  No, go ahead.  No, you can say it, eh?  There's not...  Let's say, then, there's not as many.  There used to be every few towns over, there was a theater that was the porno theater.  You'd go in, and on film, on the big screen, would be hardcore pornography.  Triple X, with a bunch of deviants just sitting there, slippery floors and everything. 
[02:21:30]  They're all Home Depots now.  Yeah.  Yeah, they just, they...  You know, they really, the demand kind of dropped the theaters when video came out.  You could do it in the comfort of your own home.  Hey, here's a big space.  We'll put a Home Depot in it.  Yeah.  Great.  There you go.  You know where you're standing?  Toxic waste down there.  But I went to one, and it was, God, back in the late 80s, I guess.  One of the last ones.  And this girl is performing with her face, let's just say, doing a facial performance on a guy. 
[02:22:00]  She was doing neck ups.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the theater was really quiet.  Money shot happens, and she goes, oh, and she stares into the camera, and I couldn't resist.  I yelled out, yeah, but can she cook?  There were some people in there dying laughing, and the perverts just turned around, like,  pissed off that I ruined the moment. 
[02:22:30]  That I ruined the moment.  And I remember seeing your face, Norton, peeking over one of the chairs, all pissed.  Well, there are times to be funny, Ant, and times not to be, and sometimes when someone's  enjoying a money shot, it's time to be not sane.  Then there was the old gag you could pull in the theaters, where you got the little thing  of ivory liquid, which looks like a substance.  And what you would do is just squirt it over the chair, so it would hit somebody like five  rows down.  And they'd feel something and go, like, rough their collar. 
[02:23:00]  We used to do that at...  Only with the real stuff?  We used to do that at regular movie theaters.  Really?  The one in Northport with the balcony?  It's not as much fun in a regular theater, though.  Oh, the Northport balcony?  Yeah, but in the, what, during the Who movie?  In the regular theater, you're not really expecting that.  That's true.  Which adds to the surprise.  Yeah, it was bad when you do it in the porno theater, and the guy that it landed on would  start licking it off his shoulder.  Yeah, but I knew it was soap.  Or try to catch it like that shoot-the-clown-in-the-mouth-and-pop-the-balloon game. 
[02:23:30]  Awful.  So, who's upstairs?  They're out there now.  Uh-oh.  Bring him in for one second.  By the way, can I make one announcement?  I'm sorry.  I called the Stress Factory, and no one is answering the phones, which is a good way  to do business, you know, two and a half hours before the show.  Don't answer the phones.  Let the machine pick it up.  You idiots!  Yeah, Norton at the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow, right?  I don't want to give out the 732-545-HA-HA number again.  I've done that too many times.  And that would be slutty and gratuitous. 
[02:24:00]  Speaking of slutty and disgusting, let's bring in, who is outside, the retarded Laverne  and Shirley.  Here they are, Marion and Lady Di.  Hi, Marion, Lady Di.  How are you girls today?  Over here.  Yeah, give them that mic over there.  There you go.  As far away from me as possible.  Hey.  There's a mic!  You guys talk into the mic.  Here they go.  Morons!  How are you guys been here?  This is classic. 
[02:24:30]  These two friggin'...  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  How you guys doing?  Hi.  Hi.  I'm glad you're okay from your car accident.  I'm glad your girlfriend's okay, too.  We are.  Yeah.  Look at how concerned.  Lady Di said, yeah, we are.  Do you know...  Lady Di, what do you do?  You put a bowl on your head and give yourself a haircut?  No.  What'd you go with the dyke haircut for?  Hey, I got mine cut Wednesday.  I want to say...  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  No, I'm...  Lady Di, what'd you do to your hair?  I had to get a trim.  You look like something out of a John Woo film. 
[02:25:00]  I knew you were going to say something smart.  Ciao, young fat pig.  I was waiting for that.  I was waiting for that.  Hi, Ray.  They're not going to pick on you.  They're going to pick on me now.  It's my turn.  No, Lady Di, you cut your bangs too high.  Yeah, you cut them too high.  Wait, wait, wait.  And Lady Di, they're thinned out too much, too.  No, it's weird.  You see that same look on some of the supermodels that walk around Manhattan, you know, where  they make their bangs way too high? 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  But in a weird way, it looks cool.  You look completely retarded.  Yeah.  Okay.  I was more turned on looking at Dialis' arm.  It's going to grow out.  Hey, Opie, Anthony, what happened to the Plenty Up Top lady?  We were hoping to see her.  Oh, really?  We heard it before, but...  Why?  Because you guys have no on top?  Well, we have a lot on top.  I have too much up here.  No, on you it's called Plenty Down Top.  No, no.  I have too much up here.  I don't know where the boobs end and the bunt begins. 
[02:26:00]  Hey, did you hit your head in a car accident?  Yeah, I did.  Why?  How you doing?  Hey, how you doing?  Really?  All right?  What, are you making fun of a car accident?  No, we don't do that.  We don't do that.  What was that?  When I was 21, so...  What was that?  I'm just glad that you were okay.  What happened to you at 21?  I was in a car accident.  And what happened?  I'm not saying.  I broke my arm.  You broke your arm?  I broke my arm.  Broke your arm?  Yeah.  What else happened?  That's it.  Hey, let me see your arm.  What happened?  Is that from it?  Yeah.  So you were born with that face?  No, I did.  I mean, it's no big deal. 
[02:26:30]  I'm 37 now, so it doesn't bother me.  I want to say hi to Danielle, the one that does my hair, and I'm going to say hi to  the corner bar.  Who cares?  Yeah, Franny and George.  Who do we meet with?  And the bar across the face.  And Gary?  Is that her name Gary?  Lenny Squiggy?  Who are we met last Friday?  Angie?  Hello.  Hello.  Ying Yang.  Party.  Party.  Oh, Ying Yang.  Party.  Ying Yang.  Hey, Mary.  No, he went out with me.  Mary, shut up.  What?  Did you get your hair done again?  I got it cut Wednesday. 
[02:27:00]  It's awful.  It's horrible.  No, it ain't.  It's awful.  Don't show, Opie.  Because you guys are ugly enough.  You're making yourselves look uglier.  No, we're not.  Hey, I'm not doing that.  Your bangs are too short, and her hair's too tight again.  No, it's not.  It's trim.  Your perm was starting to loosen up, and now it's tight again.  Mary, because it's starting to get too long.  Your hair looks like a used, like, Brillo pad.  No, it's starting to get too long, so I had to get a trim.  It's tight.  No, it's not tight.  I got it cut.  I got it cut.  I know cancer patients that wouldn't walk around with that hair.  I got it. 
[02:27:30]  Norton.  That's your hair.  No, no.  You got it.  Lady Di, why did you dyke yourself up with that hairdo?  I got a trim, so this way goes in a little bit.  No, that's not a trim.  Who cut your bangs like that?  My hairdresser.  You know what hairdo that is?  Oh, my God.  She's got the hairdo from...  From where?  I'll tell you who it is.  Go ahead.  From where?  It's Mary from The Little Rascals.  Hey, O.P.  Remember Mary?  Okay, yeah, I remember.  Hey, remember when we were here?  I was thinking that actress Rossellini. 
[02:28:00]  Isabella Rossellini?  Isabella Rossellini.  Well, I am Italian.  When she had her...  Well, you don't look like her, though.  Hey, O.P.  Remember when we were here a few weeks ago?  You want pictures of us?  No.  When we were younger, we bought them.  Oh, younger.  Bring them over.  Get them right to me.  Write to me.  Wait, wait, wait.  Not to be to you.  Look, just give them to me.  I've got two pictures in here.  Jesus Christ, you've taken forever.  No, these are the ones.  Give them to me.  The pictures out.  They're a roadshow.  Let me see.  They're not...  Rick, just give me those right away.  I've got to see the young...  They're a roadshow.  I've got to see the young Lady Di and Marion pictures. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, no.  There's the young Lady Di.  Lady Di, you were never a thin girl, were you?  Oh, yes, I was.  You were never a thin girl.  What's the sore on the lips?  Look at the sore on the lips.  Marion looks exactly the same.  Let me see.  Look at Marion.  She looks exactly the same.  Marion.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, Anthony.  No.  I was heavier.  And those pictures.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus. 
[02:29:00]  Look at this 80s look she's got.  She looks like Tommy Shaw.  Who looks like Tommy Shaw?  Too much fat on my bones.  We told you guys she was heavier.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  All right, hold on.  Anthony, I've got another one.  She looks like Tommy Shaw, and Lady Di looks like a fat Ralph Macchio.  Let me see that picture.  That's a horrible picture of me.  That is a horrible picture. 
[02:29:30]  I hate that picture.  Oh, the karate man it is.  Diane has hers.  I hope Diane has hers.  That was a little bit after I had my son.  I don't like that picture.  All right, here is.  I'm looking at maybe a thinner Lady Di.  Yes, that's right.  Those are the better ones.  Over here.  Those are the better ones.  Looking at a thinner Lady Di.  Better ones that I found.  You got one.  She has one, too.  I do.  Wow, Lady Di used to look like that.  I'll give you some props for that.  I'd have thrown you a banging back then.  I might have even thrown you a banging back then. 
[02:30:00]  I was into the monkeys when I was 22 years old.  You would have.  I don't look like one.  No.  Wow, and look at Marion in this one, holding up her beer with her little striped shirt.  That was what we were doing.  We were 21-22.  Marion, horizontal stripes never on you.  No, I didn't like that shirt.  Oh, my God.  She's got a turtle racist shirt on. 
[02:30:30]  Told you we wanted the turtle racist.  There's the turtle racist.  Told you about them.  We got to get one of these up on the website.  Yeah, definitely.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was wondering if there's any truth to the rumor that their hairdresser is Blind Dave.  Blind Dave.  Matt, maybe?  Is your hairdresser Blind Dave?  No, my hairdresser is Frank.  You don't marry it?  Maybe it's Blind Frank.  He's a barber.  Relax.  That's what I was going to say.  Let me tell you something.  Why?  I respect you because you do fight back when these people attack you and stuff, but your  hair, what are you doing? 
[02:31:00]  I got it trimmed again.  It looks like cotton candy or something.  You know why I'm letting it grow out.  That's why.  The only way to let my hair grow out is to keep getting it trimmed once a month.  And it grows out.  That's why.  I mean, Steve.  I'm letting mine grow out.  Yeah.  I'm going to Florida in September, too, for four days.  You look like a Supreme Court justice of 1804.  Hey, ladies, do you want to enter the man boom contest?  No.  Okay.  Diane, where are you going?  I want to see what pictures they're going to put on the... 
[02:31:30]  Hey, they got yours up there.  Lady Di is one of those girls.  Look at this.  In the bar, you pick her up after a few and stuff.  I'd have slammed that.  And then you wake up and you stab her repeatedly.  That's me.  Oh, my gosh.  Lady Di.  That's me with my t-shirt.  I got to say, in this picture, you're respectable.  Thank you.  I just got this done Wednesday, so...  It's not happening.  That is a really nice picture.  It was starting to grow out.  I was starting to feel it.  I know.  I was starting to feel it.  It's starting to get too frizzy up here.  I was starting to get a little feeling, you know, for you.  No, no.  It's starting to get too frizzy right here, so I have to let it keep getting a cut. 
[02:32:00]  Let it grow out.  Why would you style your hair like a stormtrooper?  There's no reason to have that.  Hey, Jim, in the summertime, you're supposed to wear your hair like this.  You don't got to blow dry it.  Who's got time when you get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to blow dry her hair?  Come on.  I get up at 4 every morning.  My daughter.  What do you know?  You're not a woman.  You guys ain't married.  Sleep in.  Rick's married.  He knows what it is.  Hey, can we see your panties?  Yeah, let us see your drawers.  I want to see your panties. 
[02:32:30]  I am in a mic.  No, you're not.  Oh.  I think he's getting pissed.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  I am talking into the mic.  Wow, Joe's got it online, too, what your hair looks like.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey, Opie, you guys are great.  Oh, thank you, man.  He's only lady-dized hair looks like Ronald McDonald's haircut.  No, not Ronald McDonald.  Yeah, that's a little Ronald McDonald.  Ronald McDonald has red hair.  Oh.  All right.  Hey, man, I'll see you guys.  He looks like Bo's already clown, Ronald McDonald. 
[02:33:00]  That was a brilliant analogy.  Yes.  Boy, when she's on the money, he's not stopping her.  Just let it lie there.  It was piped down.  Piped down.  Piped down.  I love it.  Thinking of McDonald's, I don't want to say now.  I don't know if you've read it in the paper.  What?  You giving us stuff for our show?  What happened?  Some material.  Good riff.  I saw a guy in Herald Square yesterday, and they ended up eating a hypodermic needle.  Oh.  Some lady stuck her tongue with her.  Well, there goes that advertiser.  That's horrible.  I don't need a McDonald's.  This is what Marion's saying.  I don't need a McDonald's.  This is what I read in the post. 
[02:33:30]  Have you ever laid naked and had McDonald's cheeseburger?  I don't need McDonald's, Jim.  I don't need McDonald's.  I don't like fast food.  That's why.  All right.  Let me talk to Frank.  You don't like...  Frank?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I was looking at the pictures of Marion on the website, and all I could think of was  Henrietta Hippo from the New Zoo Review.  Oh, my God.  What?  You look like Henrietta Hippo.  Your sister looks like Henrietta Hippo.  Oh, my God.  She's got the comeback.  That's funny.  Your sister looks like Henrietta Hippo.  I'm not heavy.  I'm not fat. 
[02:34:00]  It's the New Zoo Review.  Compared to what?  I'm not.  You're a little tired today, right?  No.  Your comeback sucked today.  No, I am.  You're usually a little sharper than this.  What do you mean?  We've been working all day today.  All right.  No.  No.  How are we going to booze when we're waiting for a train at quarter to five?  What?  We don't booze.  I wasn't even...  What?  You've been waiting for a train at quarter to five.  It's 6.30.  Yeah, because New Jersey Transit was on like 25 minutes late.  What do you mean you're not fat?  Can you go back to that?  I'm not fat.  What does that mean?  In other words, compared to what I was two years ago, okay? 
[02:34:30]  What were you?  I went from 210 pounds to 278.  She's proud of her weight loss there, Jim.  What's that?  She's proud of her weight loss.  And I'm still losing.  Okay, cool.  And I'm still losing.  All right, that's good.  I haven't stopped.  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  I haven't gave up.  I'm not.  Well, ladies, thanks.  I got to go.  We'll see you later, right?  Okay, we'll see you later.  There they go.  Show me the pictures.  The ones that you got.  Okay.  They're right there.  We saw all of the pictures of you guys when you were in your yin-yang party.  21, 22, 23. 
[02:35:00]  We're still yin-yang party.  Do you want one for the website?  You used very, you looked very 80s.  I mean, these are the ones we only came up with.  Lady Di, what happened?  Where did it go wrong for you?  Well, I had my son.  Do you resent him now for distorting your body?  No, I don't.  Not at all.  I would.  She's been up and down, up and down.  It's like I've been up and down.  We've all been up and down.  You've never been down.  No, real.  No.  No, she is.  You have red whistles with dust on them. 
[02:35:30]  She lost around 40 pounds.  How many times?  I'm 40, and then I gained a little bit.  I can lose weight, too, if I want to.  But then I'm losing weight again.  But you don't want to lose weight.  No, no, no, no, no.  You don't want to look attractive.  No, you know what her problem is?  I'm going to tell you.  I walk every day.  I don't walk.  I walk every day, twice a day.  Every day, twice a day.  At work, and out of work.  I do.  You might want to go up to four times a day.  Okay.  Yeah.  You can do that.  I walk, actually, almost three times, because I walk to work most of the time.  Okay.  And trying to get her to come out of the house three times a week is very tough for her. 
[02:36:00]  And you do realize that elephants walk as well.  I don't know.  Do you?  No, I'm saying, in Africa, how do you think they get around?  Like, scooters?  They walk.  Do you?  Do you walk?  Yeah, look at her.  I guess he does.  Her comebacks are just fine.  All right, the ladies.  It's me, ladies.  Thank you.  Thank you for the pictures.  We'll put them up on the website.  You can check them out.  The yin-yang party girls.  People don't like when we spend too much time with you on the air.  Why?  I don't know.  You're funny.  You know what?  You're funny in small doses.  A lot of people.  You've got to know when to leave, right, Jim? 
[02:36:30]  No, we don't.  You leave on an up note, right?  A lot of people tell us we're funny on the radio.  No one does.  No, I am.  My friends that listen to it listen to you guys.  Nobody tells you that.  My friends, too.  Our friends, really.  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  What are they going to say?  People that know me from the morning show.  Thank you.  Lady Di, do they all have the Down syndrome haircut?  They know her from being on a show.  They think it's cool.  That's what it is.  No, it's not going to be like this.  I take your heart.  I take your heart.  You want snotty fries.  What?  Where's Earl?  Will you leave, please? 
[02:37:00]  It doesn't matter.  I'm not asking you where's Earl.  It doesn't matter where Earl is.  I want to talk about the game last Saturday.  Hey, Steve.  Steve, official bounce for the Opie and Anthony show.  I think the ladies are done.  Can you please remove them from the conference?  I would love to.  Ladies, out.  All right.  There you go.  Hold the door.  Don't let it hit.  All right.  All right.  Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out because we can't buy another door.  Awful.  There they go.  Holy smoke.  Yeah, that hairdo is just amazing.  That's the worst hairdo I've ever seen. 
[02:37:30]  That is really horrendous.  You could tell that, like, Marion was totally the C-blocker for Lady Di.  Like, Lady Di, there's no beauty going on there, believe me.  Lady Di, you've got to give her props.  The old picture is not bad.  Not too bad.  She was slender.  I'd give her, like, a five and a half.  One of those 80s chicks that if you see in the bar, like I'm saying, hanging out, you 
[02:38:00]  would probably do.  But then that Marion you'd have to deal with, you know, trying to get her away from Marion.  Marion would just C-block the hell out of you.  You shouldn't have sex with that man.  He's not a good man.  You shouldn't have sex with him.  Stop him.  You can't leave.  Don't leave.  You're slut leaving me.  There's no way you could go home with that guy and have a good time with a male dinner  teller.  Because I'm not ever going to get any.  I wonder if she had the car accident because she couldn't see out the windshield saying  S and spittling all over the windshield.  I got windshield wipers on the inside of my car. 
[02:38:30]  I got a sort of a kind of a brain.  All right.  What?  Time is a bitch.  And we'll be back with what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  Now we can't do bit of the week.  Damn it.  Look at that.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  We're fat.  We're ugly.  We won't shut up and we're nauseating.  We're so annoying.  No one can take it.  When we look in the mirror, we break it. 
[02:39:00]  We'll give you nightmares all day long.  Like a couple of beevils.  Not a count of sex appeals.  Make a sense for us.  It's not possible.  A warthog.  And Godzilla.  And Leatherfish.

Ooh, can't wait for that.  Also, details.  We've got to do it Monday, Anthony.  Details on Sex for Sam 2.  Yeah, this is quite the little contest.  We held it last year.  People, couples, running around the city of Manhattan, 
[02:41:30]  having sex at various landmarks here in New York City.  For a fine trip to Boston.  And a couple that gets the most points wins a trip to Boston.  Yeah, we'll give you all the details on Monday.  And we're looking for couples, so make sure you call us on Monday if you want.  If you want in, if you want to have a lot of sex.  Yeah.  And if you want a trip to Boston, okay?  Right.  Let's see what Virginia's up to today.  Scott, what's going on? 
[02:42:00]  What's up?  I learned a lot from Jim Norton today.  Yeah?  I learned that he thinks that man boobs are nice.  Yeah.  That hair on the side of women's boobs are hot.  And Lady Di looks like something out of a John Woo film.  And that after you wake up next to Lady Di, you want to stab her.  All right, have a good day.  Very good.  Good job, man.  Later.  I'm paying attention to Norton.  Let's see what Philly has.  Philly!  Yo, what's up, ONA?  What up, what up, what up?  Not much.  What I learned today, when you're listening to the ONA show,  always have a gun handy in case Retard, Laverne, and Shirley come on. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Jeez, that was insanity.  I mean, I wanted to pull my own hair out.  I like them in small doses.  How can you like them at all?  I mean, I just have to listen to them.  You have to look at them.  Jesus, what's wrong with you people?  The whole thing is really, really funny.  I don't know what it is, but I...  It's humorous to just, like, laugh at them and not to know that you're laughing at them?  It's completely laughing at them.  Yeah, I enjoy them in small doses, I can't lie.  And we have listened to the listeners.  They've said that, you know, they spend too much time on our show,  so we're kind of shortening their segment. 
[02:43:00]  Right, it's funny just to laugh at them and how dumb they are with what Norton said,  the stormtrooper haircut.  They don't shut up.  They do not shut up.  That's why we bring them in.  I mean, you get a line like that, come on.  I mean, it's just...  And the pictures, I mean, like you said, Lady Di wasn't half bad.  And you have to just listen to them.  Thank you, Chris.  Awful.  All right, see you guys later.  All right, get that wow in the back of your ride, man.  Columbus, what's going on?  Not much, what's going on, guys?  This is Jason.  How are you, bro?  How are you guys doing? 
[02:43:30]  All right.  What I learned today is that it's good to hire the handicaps because they're fun to watch.  Very nice.  Thank you, Jason.  Thank you.  Joe checking in from Bayside saying, what did I learn?  Lady Di's hair makes her look like Chow Young fat pig.  That was a great line.  Justin.  Yeah.  Hey.  I learned that if you stick a flashlight under a pair of boobs, it'll look like jack-o-lantern.  Yeah, boobs glow.  Boobs glow.  It's a great trick.  We will bring that to Philly when we do one of our shows live down there. 
[02:44:00]  Outstanding.  All right, Jason.  Justin, thanks.  Yeah.  All right.  Wah.  Yeah.  Rob checking in.  I learned my girlfriend ain't going to Jamaica.  No doubt B.  Wren, I learned that Stinky likes to dance to Madonna.  John, what else?  Hmm.  The latest hairstyle for retarded, annoying women is the Stormtrooper hairdo. 
[02:44:30]  I learned Anthony won't eat retarded snot fries.  Yeah.  Uh, Justin, I learned that King Gimp attended the Senior British Open.  That's a great, great piece of video if someone has it out there.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned Adam Ferrara is no lady die when it comes to astute analogies.  Uh, Anthony, I learned person rape is bad sex.  Should have known that already.  Uh, West Coast Dave with my favorite line of the day. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Right here.  Today I learned what a hepatitis slurpee is.  Also from West Coast Dave.  Today I learned that you must be trying to make us all gay.  You have man boobs, the naked cowboy, Madonna concerts, and then finish us off with the retarded  Laverne and Shirley.  And Jay Panther, I learned the Vietnamese kids sound like, uh, Cox Airplanes.  You hear the two mutants cheer when you guys just mention their name out there?  Wee!  Wee! 
[02:45:30]  Party!  Ying Yang Party.  Ying Yang Party.  It was their battle cry back, uh, when they were in their 20s.  Look, they're so cool.  Uh, Rich, what's up?  Ben really hates them.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, I learned Opie was, uh, in the men's room at the Madonna concert, uh, this weekend,  and, uh, uh, forget it.  I blew it.  I'm sorry.  He punched out.  I'm right in the middle of traffic.  It's all right, Rich.  Just yell, I'm stupid.  No, I can't do that. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  He punched out.  He punched out.  That's okay.  The plane went down in flames, but he bailed out.  Oh, man.  Better than staying with it until you crash into the ground.  Very good.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, today I learned that.  Lady Di and Marion both have rusty rape whistles.  Yep.  Somebody said dusty, but I said rusty.  That's all right.  I like dusty.  That was not.  Very good.  Let's, uh, see what Joe has.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned a ton of useless crap today.  Yeah.  Opie does a great Superfriend sound effect. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, thank you.  I've been working on that all week.  And, uh, Marion was born with that face.  You ain't party stinky.  Stinky rules.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  You do hear them every time you mention their names.  I learned Colin Powell's white.  We did learn that.  I learned that retards secrete retard juice.  Another Anthony learned, I'm not voting in the man-boob contest.  You got to.  Because these guys, you know, they really want this procedure.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  You got to vote for your most pathetic, uh, guy there.  Uh.  Boobs are not toys and they can cause injury.  We did learn that.  Uh, I learned ivory soap has two uses.  Used to.  Good Joe.  Hey, Joe, what did you learn on the show today?  Two things, guys.  Yeah.  That on a Friday at 620, when you're a little bit out of steam after a busy week,  you let those two sweaty, bloated cows, Laverne and Shirley,  back into the barn.  And also, those two sweaty, bloated animals are as funny as a mousetrap caught in my junk. 
[02:47:30]  Syndication went, oh, wait a minute, never mind.  Very good.  Turkish.  Hey, guys, I learned a couple of things today.  I learned, uh, Opie sang Lucky Star with Madonna last night.  No, I didn't.  I learned ONA is a required taste.  And I learned sometimes during, I learned during a money shot, laughter is not appropriate.  Nice.  Very good.  Thank you.  Kieran. 
[02:48:00]  Kieran?  Yeah.  What did you learn?  I learned, uh, that mongoloids have, uh, Pete Rose's haircut.  Or Mo from Three Stooges.  Yeah.  Very good, Kieran.  Okay.  Thank you.  I learned, uh, wow, Anthony from West Orange on fire today.  I learned a Broadway show gets you three fag points.  You gotta keep track of that.  Danny!  Yo, I learned that Madonna is bitchardly.  Bitchardly.  I'm glad you picked that up.  And that Oprah, Opie gets punched in the face for laughing at retards. 
[02:48:30]  It's indication about time tools.  No, I got punched in the face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was confused.  Lady Di and Marion, what, Rick?  You can say it yourself.  You don't have to write it down.  Lady Di and Marion right now are yelling at the callers who are bashing them.  They're yelling at the speakers, basically.  Oh, God.  You're freaking retards.  You're freaking retards.  Marion and Lady Di are a bunch of retards.  Oh, Rick, you just blew my bit.  You gotta keep the door open.  That's how it works. 
[02:49:00]  They're yelling at the listeners and calling up.  All right.  Uh, Bill, what's up?  I learned that when Opie's in the mainstream with a bunch of fags at a Madonna concert,  he has trouble taking it all in.  No, that's not what I said.  You might have said that.  I didn't say it like that.  You're killing me over here.  Look, listen, they're totally, they are so self-centered.  Oh, my God.  All right, we'll wrap it up, Ben.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, we're out of here. 
[02:49:30]  It's time to go for the weekend, but we'll be back on Monday.  Got tons of more, tons of more.  Tons of more hundreds of stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, guys, thank you so much.  We had a lot of fun this week.  Yes, we did.  And, um, next week we welcome a bunch of new cities.  Oh, we do.  The virus starts spreading again next week.  More people that won't get it and will yell at us that we suck.  Oh, I know.  God, just when you think some of the cities are turning around, new cities join and hate us. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, well.  And either the other cities kind of hate us and some, well, you're growing on me.  What a pain in the ass this syndication thing is.  Working on it.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend.  Hey, this is Ted Knight.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  The weekend's coming and I don't have any money. 
[02:50:30]  No money, no problem.  Saturday night from 7 to 10, it's Brother Wheeze absolutely free.  I don't have a date either.  No dates, no problem.  At 10, Eddie Trunk plays the best hard rock and metal on Saturday Night Rocks.  You're a total freak of nature.  Saturday night, kick it off with Wheeze at 7 and at 10, spank your junk with Eddie Trunk.  You dateless punk, 1027.  I need a tissue.  W-N-E-W. 
[02:51:00]  Anthony Bud Light.  Bud Light.  Bud Light.  You know something?  You want a light beer, you're going to want Bud Light.  That's right.  You don't want, uh...  When you're smashing CDs, that Lady Di gives you to play.  Lady Di, get in here for one second.  You want a Bud Light, you're going to the beach or the ballpark.  Bud Light, the perfect companion.  It's cool, it's crisp, and it tastes like Bud.  Now, it's in a cool, new, clear, plastic, uh, bottle. 
[02:51:30]  Oh no, it's got a plastic label.  Oh, both of them?  Whatever, the beer tastes good.  Where do we go?  Oh, shut up.  The CD Smashing, sponsored by Bud Light.  Shut up.  Oh, here we go again.  Just say the name, say the name on the air, that's all.  Why do you want us to play this band?  They're really good.  Uh-huh.  It's a good rock band.  I got it, I got it.  With your meaty little fist, put your hand in there.  Oh, baby.  You got it?  Okay.  Thank you.  Pull your face away.  Diane, I told you.  Why do you keep bringing on CDs?  You know they're going to wrestle. 
[02:52:00]  Bud Light.  I have another one.  I told you this morning, Diane.  Why are you doing that?  Bud Light, yes.  Oh, B.  Drink Bud.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Lady Di's throwing stuff back at you.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Drink a Bud Light.  I love Bud Light.  It wasn't my idea to bring her.  That's her CD.  You know Bud Light?  It's okay, Opie.  I told you, don't do that.  What happened the last time?  It's okay.  It's all right.  Don't be fooled by imitation.  You're sick.  We only want the best.  Bud Light.  You are sick. 
[02:52:30]  No, I'm not.  Oh, my God.  What?  What's stuck in your throat?  I said she's thick-headed.  No, I am not.  She's what?  Did you say thick or sick?  Thick-headed.  Thick-headed.  Thick-headed.  Anthony, I just figured it out.  What?  Can I see her tongue?  Why?  Just, can I see it?  No, like, show it without sticking it out.  Like, just open your mouth.  No, you can see my tongue, if you want.  I was trying to figure out why the voice.  I got it.  You shut up, Buddy Hinton.  What?  The tongue's too big for the mouth, right? 
[02:53:00]  No.  Yes, it is.  Maybe the mouth is too big for the tongue.  It's nice.  You get a nice drag on that.  I love the way you do dice, Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  I think you love everything that Anthony does.  Thank you, Lady Di.  Of course you do.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  So, for the real taste that won't fill you up and never lets you down, make it above light.  I'm glad you're okay, and I'm glad Sandy's okay.  Shut up. </pre>
