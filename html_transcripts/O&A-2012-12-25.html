<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a holiday-themed segment featuring Uncle Paul as a guest host.  The main focus was a New York Post list of the worst Christmas songs, which the hosts and Uncle Paul dissected with highly profane commentary. Songs discussed and played included "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer," a racist song about a house sale, "Guido Christmas" by Joey Balls and Carmen Uch, Barbra Streisand's "Jingle Bells," "The Singing Dogs" version of "Jingle Bells," Eric Cartman's "O Holy Night," and Sherwin Sleeves' song (which received intensely negative reactions and creative lyric reinterpretations).  A listener-submitted, incredibly offensive and racist Italian-themed Christmas song also sparked considerable outrage and laughter.  The segment included a phone segment with listener reactions ranging from amusement to deep offense.  Technical difficulties finding audio files added to the comedic chaos.

The show then transitioned to Anthony's hatred of "The Name Game" and "Sleeves' Christmas Story," a Christmas song described as a "funeral dirge."  Extensive, crude discussion and interpretation of "Sleeves' Christmas Story" ensued, prompting absurd name game versions of the song.  Opie detailed the malfunction of his "snowing Christmas tree," resulting in a snow-covered apartment and a toddler son throwing fake snow everywhere.  Callers added to the chaotic discussion about the songs and the snowy tree.  The Star Wars Holiday Special was heavily criticized, with Anthony expressing strong disdain. A call from Eric was interrupted by his delivering Anthony's yogurt, leading to talk of the Jingle Ball and voicemails from comedian Rich Voss.

Rich Voss' rambling, self-aggrandizing voicemails dominated the next segment,  followed by a discussion of Bill's 20-year plan to live in the woods and various celebrities' plans to disappear from the public eye, all punctuated by vulgar jokes. The Star Wars Holiday Special received another scathing critique, targeting its poor acting, plot, musical numbers (featuring Beatrice Arthur and Jefferson Starship), and Wookiee family scenes.  The Snuggie infomercial was mocked, and a caller shared a story about ordering a Snuggie his daughter didn't actually want. The segment ended with a caller's story about avoiding a police ticket and audio clips from the Star Wars Holiday Special and Bing Crosby and David Bowie's "Little Drummer Boy" duet, again accompanied by offensive commentary.

The next segment started with a nonsensical story involving Bing Crosby, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, sexual acts, a piano, and a "Hershey Highway."  The hosts played a game guessing the year of a Bing Crosby recording (1977), leading to humorous speculation about his death.  Listener calls recounted disastrous family Christmases, featuring tales of parental conflict, infidelity, and other upsetting events.  Discussions followed about the difficulties of gifting technology to older relatives, culminating in Anthony's own Christmas anecdote about his nieces and nephews destroying his house.

The final segment focused on Anthony's gambling trip to the Borgata casino, detailing his high-roller treatment, poker games, winning, encounters with prostitutes, and a naked shower video filmed by his friends.  A caller then described an incomprehensible Christmas lights scam, with much confusion and laughter surrounding the caller's use of the phrase "bang him out." The hosts and co-hosts, possibly including Danny and Keith, expressed bafflement at the scam's details.  The humor throughout the final segment stemmed from the absurdity of the Christmas lights story and the outrageous details of Anthony's casino trip. The broadcast maintained a consistently vulgar and profane tone throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Well, hey there. Season's greetings to young and old alike. Especially the young. Yes, the very young.  Yay.  We now invite you to put on some cocoa, fire up the Yule Log, and enjoy a holiday-themed trip through the ONA Archives.  As the O.P. and Anthony Channel presents an Uncle Paul Christmas.  Here's your host, Uncle Paul.  Have a holly jolly Christmas.  Hi there.  Welcome to an Uncle Paul Christmas. 
[00:00:30]  I'm Paul Hargis.  And I'm going to host your holiday festivities.  It's a marvelous time of year.  Everybody's laughing and smiling.  All the kids standing under the mistletoe, waiting to get their presents.  Yay, Uncle Paul, wear my gift.  Come here.  Stand under the mistletoe.  Talk to you about your present. 
[00:01:00]  I don't like this goddamn radio show.  They use dirty language.  They're not very creative.  But I'm doing this because I'm not allowed to be around certain young people around the holidays.  Bunch of goddamn liars.  In this first segment, the guys review some of the worst Christmas songs ever made.  I love Christmas songs.  It's the worst of the O.P. 
[00:01:30]  Anthony Show.  Well, this should bring in the new subscribers.  Is that it?  No, Ben's looking for it.  I thought Ben said he found it.  Did he lie to the boss?  Oh, he said he found it?  Yeah.  Oh, well, he said Eric told him where it was, and now we can't find it where Eric said it was.  All right, so we can't do that yet.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  That would have saved us, too.  That would have saved us.  It would have been kind of cute and wacky. 
[00:02:00]  Did the laptop ban for sperm?  That was good.  When Eric leaves the building, nothing can be found.  Where's Eric?  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Eric is nowhere.  Will you guys shut up?  No, no, no.  You're going to ruin it.  Hey, you forgot that Dick Clark did have a stroke.  I think we talked about that.  Yes, we did.  Yep, crossed that off the list.  How about that a little bit?  How about the laptops or bed for sperm?  We did that.  I wonder, was there any kind of list of worst Christmas songs?  I've been thinking lately, like, I would love to just talk about that for a little while.  If there's a list, there's probably not, though, is there? 
[00:02:30]  We don't have number four.  We're trying to find number four.  Number four in a what amount of song list?  The top five worst Christmas songs of all time.  Oh, is that what you're looking for?  I actually did not know that.  Can we go five, three, two, one, and get to four when we get it?  I guess.  I think Clark's going to do it this year with an old stroke lip.  Do you have it now?  Did you take it away from me?  Five, three, two, one, four.  He can't hurt me.  I'm sorry.  I stepped below that podcast.  That's okay.  That was awful. 
[00:03:00]  I stepped on you.  I know that's the one we're looking for.  I know.  Where was it?  Was it over here in this pile?  It's right here.  What a goddamn mess.  All right.  The top six worst Christmas songs of all time.  Now, who's judging these to be the worst?  This was according to the New York Post.  These are songs that people hate hearing around the holidays.  They hate the most, yes.  In Sixth Place.  It's a song that we talked about a couple days ago.  Elmo and Patsy.  Ugh. 
[00:03:30]  And this fine number.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  This is awful.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Ugh.  Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.  Yeah.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  Was this even funny for five minutes?  But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.  Now the plot thickens.  She's been drinking too much eggnog.  And we begged her not to go.  Uh-oh. 
[00:04:00]  What's going to happen?  But she forgot her medication.  Yeah.  And she staggered out the door into the snow.  Oh.  Not that one.  When we found her Christmas call.  The other one now.  Someone threw a turkey at her face.  No?  She had hoof prints on her forehead.  Oh.  And incriminating cause marks on her back.  Oh.  She'd been raped in the bushes. 
[00:04:30]  Grandson got drowned by a reindeer.  Oh.  You can say there's no such thing as Santa.  CP in the house.  As for me and Connor.  Can we believe?  Now we're all so proud of Grandson.  All right.  Well, that's number six, Anthony.  Going fishing.  Early this morn.  Oh, no.  Yeah, that's number six. 
[00:05:00]  And he's got a guppy niblet at his toes.  Oh.  Incriminating flounder marks on his feet.  Dum, dum, dum.  Connor got rowed by a rowboat.  Silly goose left the blonde hair in the rowboat.  Rowing home from fishing Christmas Eve.  All right.  We're looking at the six worst Christmas songs of all time, Anthony. 
[00:05:30]  In fifth place is this fine number.  The house next door to me's been sold to niggers.  They claim to be wild Indians from the plain.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Oh, but they ain't a-shuckin' me there, colored people. 
[00:06:00]  Wow.  We'll make cowboys and niggers our new game.  I don't believe that's the Christmas song.  Last night when I come home, I don't believe that's a Christmas song, Anthony.  No, I don't think so either.  I think you have number five, don't you, over there?  I'm sorry.  Do I have it?  Number five.  That was obviously a mistake.  All right.  Here it is.  The fifth worst Christmas song of all time.  All right.  The internet is for porn. 
[00:06:30]  The internet is for porn.  Track.  Hit me up all night, hugging me.  Porn to porn.  Porn, porn.  All right.  Stop, Anthony.  Yeah.  I got it over here.  All righty.  The fifth worst Christmas song of all time.  Is this the Singing Dogs, I think?  Billy Squire?  I don't know. 
[00:07:00]  I don't know.  Shoot it!  Oh!  We hate all shoot dicks!  Andy Warhol!  Shoot it!  Mick Jagger!  Shoot it!  Michael Jackson!  Shoot it!  Yeah!  Jeffrey Dahmer!  Cannonball!  Shoot it!  Yeah!  We hate shit digs!  Yeah! 
[00:07:30]  Butt slamming tic-tics!  Yeah!  Boy George!  Shoot it!  Freddy Mercury!  Shoot it!  Yeah!  David Bowie!  Shit digs!  Yeah!  Rob!  Halford!  Dude is!  Freddy's shit digs!  Yeah!  I don't think that's a Christmas song, Opie.  No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think so.  I enjoy listening to a good rendition of shit dick.  I'm sorry.  My blood sugar is dropping.  I thought that made the list, but I guess not. 
[00:08:00]  What's the number five song, Opie?  Well, the number five song...  Grandma got run over by a shit dick.  We found corn and peanuts in her hair.  Oh, God.  I almost lost it through my nose.  All right.  Let's get control back in this show here, Anthony.  We got it.  It's the top six worst songs during the holiday season.  Coming in at number five, it's some friends of ours, actually.  This is real. 
[00:08:30]  It's Joey Balls and Carmen Uch.  They used to do the Yankees' How You Doing song.  Well, they made the list.  Worst Christmas songs of all time.  Number five, it's Guido Christmas.  Twelve days of Guido Christmas.  Hey, Joe Balls, Merry Christmas.  Oh, Carmen Uch.  I heard you saw G-Noose.  Yeah, my Paisan.  Let me tell you what he got me this year.  On the first day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me a ride in his eye, Roxy.  I love that car.  On the second day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me two guinea teas and a ride in his eye, Roxy. 
[00:09:00]  On the third day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me all tree got flotters, two guinea teas and a ride in his eye, Roxy.  I, I, I.  On the fourth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me four fresh cannolis, all tree got flotters, two guinea teas and a ride in his eye, Roxy. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, man, I can't take it anymore.  On the fifth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis, all tree got flotters, two guinea teas and a ride in his eye, Roxy.  Shut up!  Shut up!  On the sixth day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me six Sergio Dakinis, five pinky rings. 
[00:10:00]  Four fresh cannolis, all tree got flotters, two guinea teas and a ride in his eye, Roxy.  Turn it off!  On the seventh day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me seven Piazza Dakinis, five pinky rings.  Four fresh cannolis, all tree got flotters, two guinea teas and a ride in his eye, Roxy. 
[00:10:30]  All right, coming in fifth place, one of the worst Christmas songs of all time, Joey Balls  and Carmen Uch, 12 Days of Guido, Christmas.  Quiet.  Can I tell you, that turn it off clip will make me laugh whenever it's played.  Oh, I love it.  You got to see the movie, though, when he's just sitting in that movie theater chair watching  his daughter get pounded in a porno movie.  Turn it off.  Like at first, turn it off.  Listen to it without anything over it, because it's just, the first one is he's just disgusted,  but he's trying to hold it together. 
[00:11:00]  Turn it off.  But he just loses it.  She's with two guys in the movie, by the way.  One's tagging her in the ass, and then she's blowing the other one.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off!  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[00:11:30]  Turn it off.  His little girl.  Why is he laughing through that, though?  Turn it off.  Look at the way she's taking it on the chair.  All right, Anthony, the fourth worst Christmas song of all time, according to New York Post.  Just readers, I guess.  It's good old Barbra Streisand.  Babs.  Singing Jingle Bells.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  She messed up the song.  With that fast motion.  Crap singing.  She did that.  We're dashing through the snow.  In a one-horse open sleigh.  All the fears we go.  Laughing all the way.  What?  Making spirits bright.  What fun it is to sing a sleighing song tonight.  Jingle bells.  Jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  I thought I'd take a ride. 
[00:12:30]  And soon Miss Fanny Bright.  Was seated by my side.  All right, enough of that.  Enough of that.  Barbra Streisand.  Jingle bells, Anthony.  Yeah.  Fourth worst Christmas song of all time.  Chica, chica, chica, chica.  This is horrible.  Brian in Jersey, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey, that Greedo song was the funniest goddamn thing I've ever heard.  Funny?  Really?  That song rolled.  No, no.  You didn't mean it was funny like you laughed.  You mean it's funny that somebody would actually think it's funny. 
[00:13:00]  No, I laughed my balls off when I heard that song.  No, you didn't.  Oh.  Yes, I did.  Oh, where are you from?  Jersey.  Oh, that explains it.  All tree godfattas.  What, did you grab your ribs?  All right, thank you, Brian.  Hey, thank you.  Moving on with the list, worst songs of all time this holiday season.  Speaking of godfathers, my favorite scene was when they brought in Conor Peterson's vest with a fish in it. 
[00:13:30]  What the hell is this?  I just want to know why.  I just want to know why, the obsession over this trial.  And, whoa, Conor Peterson, I just don't understand.  The little vest.  A little diaper with a fish in it.  Please make me understand.  With one of those cheddar cheese goldfish crackers in it.  I just want to understand.  Little tiny goldfish.  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay, godfathers. 
[00:14:00]  In third place, Anthony, worst Christmas songs of all time.  Yes.  Another version of Jingle Bells, sung by the Singing Dogs.  Oh, I love when you go to a family's house and it's playing in the background. 
[00:14:30]  So jolly and festive.  Here, boy.  Here, boy.  Where'd the dogs go?  Where'd the dogs go?  Musical interlude.  How'd you have a musical interlude in the doggy song?  On the little Casio?  Miss Barbra Streisand again? 
[00:15:00]  Come here, boy.  Come here.  Here you go, you little son of a bitch.  Dude.  Brian from the Bronx, what's up?  Brian from Brooklyn, actually.  Oh, Brooklyn, I'm sorry.  No problem, no problem.  Brooklyn in the hizzy.  I'm calling about the remarks Brian from Jersey made about the Guido, 12 Days of Christmas.  Yeah.  That song was hysterical.  Since I heard I ride in the IROC Z, I couldn't take it.  I almost crashed my car.  And you should have if you laughed at that. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, I get it, because the IROC is Italian.  Oh, cool.  Hey, yeah.  I bet you they're all Italian things they say in this song.  Hey, yeah.  Four cannolis.  Oh.  Hey.  I'm ruining the other guy, right?  Jimmy.  I'm sorry, buddy?  Oh, my God.  My food is here.  Thank you, Brian.  Four cannolis.  All tree got fathers.  Hey, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Two glasses of Anazette.  Yuck.  All right.  So the runner-up for the worst Christmas song of all time, Anthony, do you remember the 
[00:16:00]  band Seymour Swine and the Squealers?  When they were shooting at their gig last night?  No?  I don't know.  I don't know that band.  Funny story.  Love when I swing and miss.  So funny, the silence.  Wow.  It's like, see, I didn't know the band's name last night, and I have no clue.  I don't know who they are, and it might as well be, but let me explain it. 
[00:16:30]  Oh.  Wow.  Okay.  Bye.  I'm sure you'll recognize the song, Anthony.  Hey, here comes that joke.  Oh, sorry.  All right.  You'll remember this.  Here comes the show.  Oh, I'm telling that joke.  Get out of the way.  Stop.  No, please.  Donk. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Seymour what?  Swine and the Squealers.  Never.  You'll recognize the song.  Here it is.  The runner-up.  For worst song.  Wait, wasn't there a fire at their show in Rhode Island?  Here it is.  Blue Christmas.  All right.  Good Christmas.  Take one.  I'll have a blue Christmas without you. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, if you feel so blue.  All right.  It'll be just thinking.  Porky pig.  Yeah.  I'll be, I'll be, I'll be about you.  I think we all know who's going to have a blue Christmas this year.  No.  Have a blue fish Christmas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We won't be the same day if you're not here with me and me and me and me and when those 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  This could really get on your nerves.  Yeah.  It's the snow flames.  It's the start falling.  It'll be the answer.  This song's almost as annoying as a dirty console.  All right.  All right.  The runner-up for worst Christmas song of all time.  There you have it.  Blue Christmas.  That was just the runner-up?  Yeah.  That was the runner-up.  Six pairs of cement shoes. 
[00:18:30]  Pete from PA.  What's up?  Hey.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing here, sweet bit?  Hi, fella.  Hey.  I just wanted to know if the dogs were barking that tune when they were looking for John  at Previson in the lake.  First of all, that lake called what?  The Pacific Ocean?  You idiot.  That little body of water?  Yeah.  I'm surprised they found him in that little hidden alcove. 
[00:19:00]  I love looking at the cops with their little dogs in wetsuits searching the ocean floor for  bodies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They sniff on the ocean floor.  Then I realized that would just be repeating your jokes, which got a laugh, so I might as  well just repeat it.  All right.  Well, Mark has a question.  Yes, Mark?  Hello?  Hey.  What's up, Mark?  Hey, it's Mark.  I just, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that song was, uh...  The 12 Days of Guido Christmas, yeah.  Yeah, the Christmas song, the Guido Christmas.  I just want to know what the other six were. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, people seem to realize, I don't know, I'm getting a lot of calls and emails that people  actually liked it and want to know what the rest of it is.  Well, I thought, I thought the, uh, the Camaro one was hysterical, the, uh, I rock beat.  The I rock guy.  Yeah, that was a good one, because they drive I rocks.  I bet you the other six things are kind of tied into a tie-ins where you go, oh, yeah,  I didn't like that.  All right.  You know what?  I guess, uh, we might have to play the whole damn song going into break in a little while.  I don't think I could stand the whole song, but I just want you to read what they say.  Why?  Uh, I don't know.  Eight pieces of ziti. 
[00:20:00]  Well, if we have to listen to the song to find out the other six, then, you know, you  guys got to suffer along with us.  Yeah, that's true.  We'll all suffer along together to find out what the other six goddamn days are.  Nine bowls of pasta vizool.  Yes.  All right.  Well, we might have to play the whole thing.  Where is that, uh, CD?  All right, Anthony.  The worst Christmas song of all time.  So excited.  We're down to number one.  Okay.  It's Eric Cartman and, uh, South Park.  I love this song.  This is the worst.  This is the best.  Oh, Holy Night. 
[00:20:30]  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  Yeah, it's a good one.  Eh.  It's haunting. 
[00:21:00]  That's haunting.  It is the name with the Christmas trees and pees.  Jesus was born and so I get presents.  Thank you, Jesus, for being born.  Lord, on your knees, as you hear me. 
[00:21:30]  Jesus, for being born and so I get presents.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:00]  There you have it.  The worst Christmas song of all time, Eric Cartman.  South Park, O Holy Night.  What? What's wrong?  I don't know if that was the worst.  Well, these lists are always stupid.  That's why we try to make them a little fun when we do them. 
[00:22:30]  A classic.  All right, let's suffer through the entire 12 days of Guido Christmas.  So I can get my blood sugar level up.  Yee.  Well, they want to know what the other six days are.  Ah.  If we have to suffer through it, they have to suffer through it.  That's the rules with this show.  All right, eh?  All tree godfathers.  Don't you turn to squiz.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  Just pull.  What?  No, sorry. 
[00:23:00]  Who?  I was just going to tell people to pull their cars over.  People always say they laugh so hard they almost crashed.  Oh, that's right.  Almost crashed my rug Z.  So actually, speed up.  And if you're tempted to laugh at this, please, I hope you do hit something.  You know, someone is requesting to play Come Sail Away from Cartman.  Man, that thing is hilarious.  Do you have a little taste of that?  Or is it...  You could what?  He, what?  He's talking in the booth.  He, uh...  He's in the fishbowl.  All right, he's going to look for it.  In the meantime, here it is.  The 12 days of Guido Christmas from Carmenuge. 
[00:23:30]  On the 12th day of Christmas, my Paisan gave to me.  You'll never know.  Forget it.  You'll never know!  Nope.  Oh, he just smashed the CD.  Yeah.  Yeah, you didn't need to know that anyway.  You didn't need to know?  Who cares, right?  Who cares, exactly?  Just wonder what the 12th day was.  It's the worst of the O.P. Anthony show. 
[00:24:00]  Can we definitely...  Can we get happy again?  Happy together.  This does it for me.  Ah, everyone calm down.  Oh, you'll know.  It's a signal.  Nice.  Oh.  It's the whole version.  Good.  It's the ooze.  I'm a new person.  Like it's really new.  I don't bother.  Here come the ooze.  You're not the one for me.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Is enough, enough. 
[00:24:30]  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Oh, I wish the sign said hang yourself.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  Oh.  I wish you, you belong.  Goddamn rich cunt.  Fucking Deer Park.  Gotta love Deer Park.  Long Island chick. 
[00:25:00]  Goddamn rich cunt.  All right, Jeff says it right.  What is this?  Oh.  What is this?  Digging it.  Put up the Christmas tree.  An Italian Christmas for you and me.  Oh, no.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You need a little context here.  Holy shit.  This is...  Oh, my God.  What?  I'm gonna be offended as an Italian-American. 
[00:25:30]  What?  What's the deal?  What's the deal?  Apparently, there was a gentleman outside for the walkover.  Yep.  It's an Italian gentleman.  Yep.  A comic.  Yep.  And he put together a song that is like the Adam Sandler Hanukkah song.  Yeah.  But it is done a la Italian.  All right.  Wait a minute.  What's his name?  It's the guy you were talking to.  Mario?  The comedian.  He's friends with Otto.  Yeah.  It's not the guy with the... 
[00:26:00]  Where's the guy with ape fights on this fucking thing who was gonna give us this...  Not the guy that gave you the CD on.  No.  No, no, no.  No.  Another guy.  This is the other guy.  This is the guy I was chatting with, the stocky guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he said he's friends with Otto.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  And he gave us this CD.  And I looked at the title and saw that it was Adam Sandler's Hanukkah song, but done...  You know, him doing it like an Italian version.  Uh-huh.  And said, Danny, please get this back to the studio.  I'm sure it's gold.  Wait.  Did he say...  How did we get this?  Now, did somebody take this out of his pocket forcefully or did he present it? 
[00:26:30]  Oh, he gave it to us.  So, please play on the show.  All right.  I'll miss his fucking number.  Thanks.  And I asked for his number.  Oh, you asked for his number?  Yes.  I heard...  What now?  Maybe three seconds of this?  I'm already offended as an Italian-American.  Well, let's listen to this.  I'm offended as a non-Karen Meyer-American.  Oh, no. 
[00:27:00]  Strap in.  Put up the Christmas tree, an Italian Christmas for you and me.  And have a bag of Zeppelis, an Italian Christmas for you and me.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, Adam Sandler, I've got some breaking news.  This song isn't about Hanukkah or a list of famous Jews.  I don't like fucking Jews.  It's about an Italian Christmas.  That wonderful day to be. 
[00:27:30]  Now, here's a list of some paisans.  Should die of BD or HIV.  A list of paisans.  So, here you go.  Let's see.  Uh, De Niro.  Uh.  Pacino.  Pacino.  Hey.

Robert De Niro.  Oh, my God.  Run right after the other.  Roberto Benigni.  Love feels scallopini.  Oh, does he?  Stop it.  Does he?  Oh. 
[00:28:30]  Oh.  Holy shit.  Roberto Benigni.  You should suck on Robert Reed's weenie.  Oh.  We need the gay version of this.  Oh, my God.  That would be one to play.  Oh.  Love feels scallopini.  Francis Ford Coppola.  Oh, of course.  Joe Pesci and Giorgio Armani.  All they want for Christmas this year is a stick of salami. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, no.  No.  Stop.  Stop it.  I'm fucking cringing.  I'd like to perform a retroactive abortion on this guy's mommy.  My sister can wear her armpit hair and braids, but she better not bring home no fucking spades.  They better have you in the song, by the way, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Where's me?  They better have you.  The Jewish song was big, but this one will be bigger. 
[00:29:30]  I am a Sicilian, and you know where I came from.  Oh, my God.  It just fell apart at the end there.  Oh, I love this guy.  Oh.  Yeah, Cantaloupe.  Oh, you better not be a stoolie, or we'll treat you like a moolie.  Stick of salami.  Oh.  Melissa Milano is Italian. 
[00:30:00]  Marissa Tomei is also.  Put them together.  Ming, you want to find looking ho-ho-ho.  Oh, what?  I'm going to drop a ho-ho-ho's.  Yeah, but I, I, Ming.  Oh, my God.  How many bad Italian restaurant fucking catering hall gigs do you have to do before this gets  applause?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Hey, I like your salami. 
[00:30:30]  They high-five like dummies.  Fucking A.  So what else has he got to mention?  He's got to mention.  The Sopranos.  Some, uh, galamad.  Uh, something about lasagna.  Uh, Tanya, lasagna.  Or, uh, I like to hold this guy.  I like to hold you down, Mario.  And come on, yeah.  How's that?  Oh, I'm gonna drop a name.  And I ain't chokin'. 
[00:31:00]  The late Francis Albert Sinatra was from Hoboken.  Oh, oh, oh.  Can I buy hot?  No.  Oh, my God.  I'm fucking big black hot.  This guy's from Smokin'.  Hoboken.  Hoboken.  Oh.  Oh.  I wish this guy was chokin'.  You fucking stink.  We don't need any more of that.  Yeah.  Good.  So hang up the provolone. 
[00:31:30]  And pay your respect to Don Corleone.  And watch what you say when on the phone.  You know when we talk, we're not alone.  Camish.  Hey, hey, say nothing.  That son of a bitch.  That they caught in the ditch.  Not Italian.  Topical.  Yes, who is.  Rocky Balboa, the Italian stallion.  Said Italian twice.  Liza Minnelli's half Italian.  Howard Stern says he's half two.  Invite them over for dinner. 
[00:32:00]  And serve them some pasta bazzle.  Oh.  Oh.  So many Italians are in the sanitation biz.  James Gandolfini isn't.  But I think Tony Soprano is.  Oh, no.  I didn't say nothing.  I swear to God.  Put up the Christmas tree.  We're all in organized crime.  An Italian Christmas for you and me.  And have a bag of Zephalis.  An Italian Christmas for all to see. 
[00:32:30]  And have some pasta and raviolis.  An Italian Christmas for you and me.  And now this song is finale.  Have a happy, merry, happy, merry Natale.  Bon Natale, everybody.  Yeah, huh?  Someone should pop your fucking eye out.  Put his head in a vice and pop his fucking eyes out.  Look, it's got the red, white, and green fucking cover on it like a pizza box. 
[00:33:00]  By the way, who decided that it was a good idea to spell Italian?  And I-T-I-A-L-I-A-N.  I don't know.  Let's ask the poli-sci professor.  Fucking beard sitting there.  Whoops.  That was a typo.  Whoops.  That was a typo.  Well, great.  How about some spell check? 
[00:33:30]  Let's go to Frank in Oceanside.  Hey, Frank.  What's up?  Oh, man.  I've never been so fucking embarrassed in my whole life.  Isn't that just embarrassing?  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Yeah, he's speechless.  Yeah.  I am offended.  Well, we got another line coming in from Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch.  So many Italians love pepperoni.  Some like it in their ass, like Mario Cantoni. 
[00:34:00]  Well, sure.  We'll take your lines if you like.  Now, that's funny.  Yeah.  Let's go to Marilyn in Indiana.  Marilyn, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I originally called to ask Jimmy for a favor for a very special Christmas wish.  But while I was on hold, I passed an exit in Virginia for Goochland, which I just thought  was funny.  Goochland.  Yeah.  You were wrong.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, come on now.  No, I wanted to know if Jimmy could wish me a special Christmas by calling me a fucking  cunt.  No, why would I do that?  That's hurtful.  Yeah, that's not nice.  No, that's not hurtful.  We try to be nice here.  All right.  I'll try it.  Merry Christmas, Mom.  I'm not going to call you a fucking cunt.  Merry Christmas, you guys.  Have a nice holiday, miss, and please, the language.  Yeah, let's say hi to John on Long Island.  John?  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Hey there, John.  I'm very, very offended.  I'm half Italian and half Chinese.  No.  You're having a tough day.  Wow, really?  My mother's from Beijing.  My father's, you know, working on Italian.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Mike on Long Island.  Set up with no punchline.  That's what we need on this show.  He eats his meatballs with chopsticks.  Half Jewish, half Japanese.  You know what that means?  What?  Gotta go.  Fucking thought after that.  Mikey, what's up? 
[00:35:30]  Did this guy sing Hoboken, New York?  Oh, yeah.  He did say that, right?  I think he did.  I don't know what he was saying.  I don't know.  He just said it was from Hoboken.  Yeah.  All right.  Then he launched into New York, like a little.  We're fishing for some lines so far.  I did not mention, you know, so far, no good.  Joe DiMaggio.  That's right.  Yeah, we should send that to the Wise Guys show.  Yeah, I'm praying.  Hey, I'm a fan.  I like that, too.  I'm sure they're playing it.  They keep stopping it.  I remember my grandmother, the rest of the piece. 
[00:36:00]  She was like, I don't like that.  Hey, we're getting a lot of requests for this song.  It's the Italian Christmas song.  Why don't we play that again, huh?  And then there'd be some awkward segue into it, like, hey, you know, Adam Sandler got  the Jewish thing.  Why can't we have it as a dance?  Why can't we have it, eh?  Hey, forget about it.  Forget about it.  Forget about it.  Uncle Paul's gone to make sure the children are nestled all snug in their beds.  But he'll return with more holiday-themed radio gold from the ONA archives. 
[00:36:30]  And Uncle Paul Christmas continues next.  We now return to an Uncle Paul Christmas.  Huh?  Warm and cozy holiday moments from the ONA archives with your host, Uncle Paul.  Once again, it's your Uncle Paul.  Here to help you through the holidays if you're lonesome.  Why don't you come on over.  Oh, look.  I spilled a little eggnog on the front of my undershirts. 
[00:37:00]  Why don't you lean over.  Kiss the eggnog, snake.  Look at that.  Come here, Timothy.  The eggnog snake is leaking eggnog.  Why don't you kiss him through the undershirts?  Everybody says I'm sick.  But Anthony knows.  He understands.  Hair ain't no good down there.  In this segment, Anthony talks about how much he hates the original Christmas song 
[00:37:30]  by Sherwin Sleeves.  I don't like it either.  Sleeves is creepy.  He don't like it because it goes la la la la.  And it don't make any sense.  In the matter, we can build a snowman.  That's the one I like.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Play a happy, play an upbeat Christmas song.  Just to see.  There we go. 
[00:38:00]  Oh.  This is terrible.  How about a fucking Jingle Bell rock or something?  No, this is perfect.  Fucking Christmas music.  Yeah, Jingle Bells, you fucking cunt.  No, this is a good one.  Christmas time.  I hate this song.  Is this Paul McCartney?  I know.  It stinks.  Smell his wife's leg stump.  That's what she wants for Christmas.  Lice off of the leg stump.  I hate this song.  Don't we have Christmas music? 
[00:38:30]  You don't put on fucking Jingle Bells.  I'm going to bite your cock.  What's wrong with that last one?  It's terrible.  It's not traditional.  What is this?  No!  What are you doing?  This isn't the Jingle Bells song we all know.  No.  There is.  I want a Christmas song that just is fucking Christmas songs.  This is what Bing Crosby's kids would hear in their head as he beat them with a lick  or fucking with a whiskey flask.  When they were coming to again.  Here we go.  Laughing all the way.  Ho, ho, ho.  Get over here, you little fuck. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, the kids weren't laughing.  No.  Not this Jingle Bells.  You know what we want.  Give us another Jingle Bells.  Oh, I want a fucking...  What about like I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas?  Just a musical version or something.  Something fun.  I don't want to get the Andrews sisters.  Oh, we'll see what he comes up with.  Reminds me of an Allied victory.  Yeah.  Boy, that singing technique went out.  Didn't it?  That's not around anymore.  What happened?  See, the problem is I don't know what White Christmas is just an instrumental in here. 
[00:39:30]  Why don't you just play anyone before you're immediately terminated?  Yeah, think on your feet.  What do you got?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  This could be the worst one.  Can we go on YouTube and find Jingle Bells?  No, I'd rather work with Travis here.  He's doing a horrible job.  This could be the worst pick ever.  What are you doing?  Which is from?  Yeah, what is this?  A manic depressive Christmas? 
[00:40:00]  It's fucking horrid.  This is The Drifters.  I don't care.  The Drifters?  Exactly.  You fucking old man.  Get something younger.  All right, let's see what it comes up with next.  Like Lead Belly.  You got Lead Belly's Christmas?  I have crash test dummies.  No.  No.  We're doing traditional.  We're doing traditional.  We don't want some fucking stupid remake.  All right, pick one that you think would be traditional.  Jingle Bells, your cliff face.  Oh, we forgot.  Isn't Travis half a Jew or something?  Yeah, he doesn't know. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, no.  His mom took off with a Jew.  Proxy.  Yeah.  She took a fucking...  Yeah, whatever.  She took a dreidel in every hole.  That's what the menorah was.  She had one candle in each hole and fucking five extra candles.  One for each hand and one for each foot.  Holy shit.  And one on our belly.  Sorry.  Travis, come on.  Another one.  Come on, Travis.  Another one, please.  Come on.  Not The Drifters.  Oh?  Has potential, Ant?  Potential?  This is traditional. 
[00:41:00]  It is, but we asked for Jingle Bells, which is kind of upbeat and fun.  Half of you were asking for Jingle Bells.  The other half won.  There's three of us.  How did half do anything?  1.5 of us?  Who is this?  This is just labeled Holiday Inn.  Holiday Inn?  Yeah.  Then it's from the movie Holiday Inn.  Probably.  Yeah.  So I think it's Bing again.  Okay.  It is Bing.  Slay.  You want Jingle Bells or you want Jingle Bell Rock?  Hold on.  Ant's doing something.  I'm sorry. 
[00:41:30]  I'm sorry.  He was.  Oh, he was quite.  You want to talk about a guy that was very different than the image on TV.  Yeah, exactly.  You talked about Tiger.  Fuck that.  Bing was a bad, bad boy.  Sure was.  Have a belt of booze.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking get your kids' blood all over the reindeer on your sweater. 
[00:42:00]  His kids hated it.  Yeah.  His fucking white snowflakes on his sweater had speckles of sun blood on them from a good  bash to the chops.  And remember, everybody, smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Let's all have a Negro-less Christmas.  Wonderful.  Snowmen are white.  Is it?  What?  Trees?  And children listen. 
[00:42:30]  Children.  Now listen to me.  I'll punch you in the face.  Yeah.  Repeat what I said.  You missed a note, cunt.  Oh, he's whistling.  He's Steve the Whistler.  Wait, who do you?  No.  With every Christmas song.  Oh, God. 
[00:43:00]  May your day may...  And you...  white all right jesus we get it  are we still looking for a song for tiger or no i forgot even where we were going with the whole

Mighty Horse rocks the fat ass.  All right, then here's what I want you to do.  I want you to get a plane and tag the sky. 
[00:56:30]  Shout out Boo Gray.  There you go, man.  See?  That's enjoyable.  But his voice is good for that.  That Christmas song is fucking depressing.  I would like the Christmas song if he just changed some of the lyrics.  I don't dislike the Christmas song.  I just don't like that he says, in the lava.  Holy, holy.  I don't like any of it.  That's my favorite part.  That's my favorite part.  Travis, play that again so we can discuss it.  Which one?  The whole song.  Play the video with it, too.  Or the animation at the same time. 
[00:57:00]  I want to see the animation.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Hold on, you.  La, la, la, la, la.  Great.  No, you know what it is?  His voice is not conducive for Christmas music.  I'm sorry.  Call me a traditionalist.  Call me an asshole.  Call me an asshole traditionalist.  I don't care.  I don't like it.  Oh, you like the Christmas song?  I tell you why.  I would like it if it wasn't for that one lyric part that bugs me.  I don't dislike his voice in it.  I like the tone of it.  La, la, la, la.  See?  It's catchy, eh? 
[00:57:30]  No, it's catchy, all right?  So is H1N1.  It's catchy.  I don't want it.  Come on.  This is the animation.  This is CokeLogic's animation of the Sleeves Christmas song.  You can put Sleeves Christmas song in YouTube.  Right.  A little piano playing.  Maybe a visual.  I was feeling pretty good.  La, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la.  Snow falling down in the la, la, la, la.  Everybody singing like la, la, la, la.  Dicking all the halls with the la, la, la. 
[00:58:00]  Making my way to the la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  He's going to a happy place.  He's forgetting his troubles.  He's in a depressing shack.  Yeah, it doesn't matter where he lives.  It's terrible.  That's the point.  I like to drink a little beer at the end of the day.  We're all walking in a town.  You're like a million miles away.  Not as low as legacy. 
[00:58:30]  Like a sand above the beach.  The lights bumping in the trees.  And people shining in the street.  And the people in the light.  All the children in the light.  Singing holy, holy lights.  I was feeling pretty good. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I was feeling pretty good.  I'm on the la, la, la, la, la.  Snow falling down in the la, la, la, la.  Everybody singing like la, la, la, la.  Dicking all the halls with the la, la, la, la.  Ah, shut up.  I can't take it anymore.  God.  I enjoyed being told my father was dead more than this.  Enjoyed the sound of that.  What is wrong with you?  This is horrible.  It's not horrible.  I like to sit out on a beer. 
[00:59:30]  It's terrible.  It's really not.  It stinks.  Look across the bank.  It's snowing, you dummy.  That's why it's cool.  Go inside.  I hate this guy.  You don't like snow.  You don't like Christmas.  You don't like.  What if they put a swastik in the video?  Would you feel better?  No.  I'm just annoyed.  Six million in the la, la, la, la. 
[01:00:00]  There you go.  Oh, shit.  There you go, man.  I actually like this song.  He doesn't have a worry in the world.  Because it's the Christmas season.  Ain't no water because it's la, la, la, la.  If I could have just saved for la, la, la, la.  The hands are small.  Clean out the munitions.  La, la, la.  Jesus.  I'm essential to the la, la, la, la, la, la.  I got one arm.  I can't shovel.  La, la, la, la, la.  See?  You get it. 
[01:00:30]  See?  You get it.  You're using pardon, pardon, you.  I left a ring around the tub and la, la, la, la, la.  A shot in the back and la, la, la, la, la.  I wouldn't let them capture you for la, la, la, la.  I shoot you in the head.  Oh, shit.  You get it.  No.  Because you're using his concept.  No.  To do other things with it.  I'm using it as, as, as, you don't understand.  La, la, la, la, la.  It brings a physical reaction. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  I have a physical reaction.  That's why we need Lydia on the phone.  Why?  Hatred.  Why?  To this song.  See, you either, I understand not liking something, but the hatred part.  That's why we need Lydia today.  No, this.  See, to delve into this a little bit.  All right.  I'll tell you one other song I could think of in my entire fucking life.  That got this reaction?  That annoyed me this much just to hear it.  Wait, let me guess.  Christmas song?  No.  No.  Rock song?  No.  More of a novelty song?  Novelty song.  Okay.  Novelty song. 
[01:01:30]  Old.  Not how you're doing, meet the Mets?  No, no.  He's going old.  I would go with the, uh, uh, the Jaws song.  The Dickie, uh, no, no, the Jaws song is bad, but, but it doesn't, it, the Jaws song  is so bad and nostalgic enough where it's like, oh, that's terrible.  But it's, that gives an emotion to me of, of pure hatred.  It brings out hatred.  I understand not liking it.  I get that.  No, no.  It's, it's beyond.  And that's fine.  Beyond not liking it.  Because it's music taste.  That's fine.  Everyone has different tastes, but to have this reaction of hate, I don't get it. 
[01:02:00]  He goes, feeling pretty good.  Good.  Like his foot.  Feeling pretty good.  And the la la la.  You don't like that?  No.  I hate it.  All right.  All right.  What's the other song you don't like?  Oh, my God.  Wait, I want to kind of guess, though.  Novelty from the 70s, obviously.  No, it goes back further.  A lot from the 60s.  I was a little, little kid and used to fucking cry when this came on.  What subject?  Christmas?  No.  What's the sound?  60s.  Novelty song.  I will never guess it.  It could be anything. 
[01:02:30]  Hold on.  Let's give it like one more minute before we fail.  No.  Oh, wait.  Was it, um.  Yes, that was it.  I hated that one.  La la la.  La la.  Jimmy's ass opens and a la la la la la.  It smells like he rocks bro.  La la la la.  60s novelty song.  Yeah.  I thought the novelty songs.  No, it wasn't Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.  Give me, uh.  Give me.  Wasn't The Lion Sleeps Tonight.  All right.  Give me a, uh, a topic.  Subject of the song.  I'll tell you something. 
[01:03:00]  There was something personal in it that included me.  Oh.  Anthony.  Yes.  Yes.  Child of an alcoholic.  La la la la.  Spaghetti of the wall.  La la la la.  Mom's yelling at the la la la la.  He's calling her a fucking la la la la.  Was molested, but he can't remember la la.  Try to make a puppet and a la la la la.  They call it a little faggot and a la la la la.  Was a sensitive kid and a la la la la. 
[01:03:30]  Tried all the time and it's la la la la.  A Mexican fucked his mouth in the bushes, la la la.  Fucked a big fatty on a horse, la la la.  Made believe he's sleeping in the tree for it because his friend wanted a la la la la.  He shoehorned lyrics into la la la.  A jeep, jeep, jeep, and a la la la la.  Can I suck your cock?  A jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  He eventually turned around and a la la la la.  Richard died of AIDS and a la la la la. 
[01:04:00]  Christy McNichol has a mullet, la la.  It's not Alice's restaurant.  Nope.  Okay.  Is it they've come to take me away?  Ha ha.  No.  Why would that?  The clue I gave away.  I gave away a clue.  Anthony, I know.  Now, Anthony is.  I know what it is.  Do you?  The name game.  Oh, you did know it.  Motherfucker.  It's not Anthony.  It's Tony.  Tony, Tony, by bony, banana, fatter. 
[01:04:30]  I still don't like it.  Thank you, Debbie.  Let's, uh, can we play that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  There's a lot of songs you don't like.  There's only two songs you fucking get a reaction of hate.  That, yeah, hatred comes out when I hear it.  La, la, la, la, la.  When I hear it.  And it took 40 years to get your second one, and it's poor sleeves?  Yes.  And he's just trying to make a living?  It's sleeves.  I don't.  Oh, no.  Turn this up.  This is groovy, man. 
[01:05:00]  And they would turn it up.  They would turn it up and make me cry.  They would turn it up.  Because the Tony part would turn it up.  Trick it, trick it.  Yes, he wasn't full thinking.  Lincoln.  Come on, everybody.  I say, now, let's play a game.  I bet you I could make a rhyme.  Out of anybody's name. 
[01:05:30]  The first letter of the name.  I treat it like it wasn't there.  This sucks.  It really, like.  Because they would turn it up and taunt me.  What is the Tony part?  Oh, it comes out.  Hitler.  Hitler.  Hitler.  Fiddler.  She's got to explain how it's done.  All right, we get it.  Stop it. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, no.  Here we go.  High pick.  Oh, yeah.  Honol, honol.  Honol, honol.  Honol.  Honol.  Honol.  All right.  But if the first two letters...  And they can never do fuck.  Okay.  Then say the name like Bob.  Bob.  Where the fuck are you, Bob?  We're having problems, you asshole.  Pick up the phone, you incompetent, soon-to-be-fired motherfucker.  Get your head out of the sand, you idiot.  Read the fucking contract so we know what's going on, Bob. 
[01:06:30]  Now, Tony with a B.  No.  Then Banana Phantom spoke.  Banana Phantom spoke.  Then you say the name again with an F.  Very plain.  Tony.  Then a B-5.  See?  They used my, like, kind of my name to explain it, and it hurt me.  And there isn't any name.  Why would it hurt?  Here it goes.  Everybody do Tony.  No.  Tony, Tony.  Let's do Billy. 
[01:07:00]  Billy, Billy.  Billy, Billy.  Red hair and a fucked up childhood.  Dad, Billy.  Let's do Bob.  Bob, Bob the slob.  I hate this.  Marsha.  Oh, Marsha.  Nick, Nick.  Oh, Big hates anything that's not white.  Lee really, Mystic?  Game. 
[01:07:30]  Got to do a Bob Kelly, though.  All right.  Lee sure wasn't full of finking.  Yeah, people saying Sleeve sounds like Tom Waits.  How can you make that fucking voice, Anthony?  You don't like Tom Waits?  No.  What's wrong with you?  You don't like the fact that the Christmas song is non-denominational?  Yeah, groovy.  We get it.  Love all around.  Yeah.  Shut it.  Let's go to Ken in Montreal.  Montreal.  Yo, buddy. 
[01:08:00]  Gerbils, gerbils, bo-verbils, banana-bo-verbils.  Banana-bo-verbils.  Richard Gere likes gerbils, gerbils.  Himla, himla, bo-bimla, bo-bimla.  Who else was there?  Eva, Eva, Bob, Eva.  Danced in the bunker.  Oh, you're gurgling.  Oh, boring.  Wait a minute.  Yes.  All right, Ken.  What do you got?  Sorry, I didn't want to step on the magic there.  Exactly.  You wouldn't need a big foot to do it.  I'm an asshole.  Thanks.  You could step on that magic with a nat toe.  All right, go ahead, boo. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, my God.  They already brought it up, but Tom Waits has the same exact vocal quality as sleeve.  Like, it's the same feel to it.  That's terrible.  Tom Waits is a legend.  Patrice, Patrice, bo-beast, banana-eating Patrice.  You know, it's always got to come back to that, these fucking people.  Matt in Ohio.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  Just want to let you know, I kind of like that tune.  It seems to me like it's an apathetic view of Christmas, that la-la-la could be replaced  with...  That's true.  Fucking...  Wait. 
[01:09:00]  Well, let him explain it.  Let him explain it.  Come on.  Matt, what?  This fucking explanation.  It seems to me that the fa-la-la-la could just be another way to say, you know, whatever.  Oh, really?  I was feeling pretty good in the fa-la-la-la.  What is that?  What is that?  What could that mean?  Go ahead.  Tell me.  Well, it's like I'm feeling pretty good, yeah.  Where?  Where?  Go ahead.  Use your mind, man!  Tell me what it means!  Look, this guy's life in general sucks, but because of the holiday, he's able to forget  all his problems and just enjoy the season. 
[01:09:30]  So why is it a funeral dirge-sounding song?  How about fucking...  How about an up-tempo number coming out of a goddamn Christmas song?  Yeah.  I gotta have a dead dog fa-la-la-la.  Where are those fa-la-la-las I was supposed to say?  Guys, get fa-la-la-las!  Don't make a fucking fa-la-la-la out of me!  I can't stop saying this.  Dude.  And he's just slowing down because he knows his problems are gonna come back as soon as  the Christmas season's over.  Good for him.  Exactly.  Before the Christmas season, he gets to forget for a little while.  That's all that's...  That's all it's about?  You guys are getting way too deep into this. 
[01:10:00]  That's all it's about.  Sleeves, not a deep guy.  Sorry.  Stop it.  And Coke Logic understood because he lives in a shitty little fucking shack.  Exactly.  Never leaves the house and a la-la-la-la.  All right.  I like that part.  I don't know.  Even Coke Logic.  I've seen much better stuff out of him.  Oh.  Now you're going after Coke Logic's video.  One shot of the guy's fucking face.  He's a loner.  I actually like that.  What?  The subject in the song is a loner and has a shitty life, but Christmas isn't going to 
[01:10:30]  bring him down.  Where does it say that?  Christmas isn't going to bring him up.  Washington, D.C.  Going to burn in hell off.  Should we listen to it again?  No!  You want to hear it again?  I would say so, because now that I described...  Now that I explained the song...  I'm sure you did.  Now it's going to make a lot more...  I don't...  No.  He's just kicking back.  If he's sitting on that dock, he should fucking put a chain around his leg with a rock on  it.  It's just...  Taking his time on the la-la-la-la. 
[01:11:00]  What's that mean?  Come on, use your minds, man!  He's taking his time...  On what?  He wants to just slow down and enjoy the fact that he has no worries in the world.  No.  No.  His home is in foreclosure, but it's...  You know, it's Christmas!  I didn't hear that.  Me neither.  I didn't hear that part.  You can afford some beers.  Yeah, true.  Having a Bud Light.  Everyone can afford beers.  You know that. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Walks into town.  Yeah.  Like a million miles...  What does that mean?  A million miles away from his problems!  Stop.  No.  I'm telling you.  Oh, wait.  This guy's fucking in the trees?  What?  Jerome in Florida is going to explain.  By the way, this is the exact same break we did last year.  Exactly.  We do this annually.  All right.  Turn this down, I guess.  We have about 250 breaks.  We just repeat one every day. 
[01:12:00]  Jerome.  Happy birthday, Jamie.  Yeah.  I believe that it does...  La-la-la-la.  You're sorry.  Holiday season.  La-la-la-la.  Yeah.  That's the obvious part.  I don't get it.  I don't get it in place with all that.  It represents that.  Shut up.  This...  No, no, no.  I'm not buying it.  Why the hatred?  It's a depressing...  Listen to me.  Why the hatred?  It's crazy then.  It's Sleeves.  It's Sleeves.  What do you want?  Yeah, Sleeves is a talent.  My God.  He's an American treasure.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  I like to molest little... 
[01:12:30]  La-la-la-la.  Oh, Uncle Lala.  Gina loves the song.  Let's see what Gina knows.  Gina!  Gina!  Yes!  Hey.  People want to know if you were an overweight kid, Anthony.  No!  I know.  Sorry.  That's pretty funny.  I'm a little skinny guy.  La-la-la-la-la.  Not you, Gina.  Jesus.  And I think it's the same thing everybody else says, that the holidays suck for me, and  I love hearing that song.  Why? 
[01:13:00]  Because the holidays suck for you?  What's the...  What sucks about it?  Yeah.  What sucks about it?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm by myself.  My boyfriend left me, and my job sucks.  So I like the song and listening to you guys.  That's it.  All right.  Why'd he leave you?  See?  It proves it.  She's fucking in a down-ass mood.  She don't want to hear happy shit, so she's listening to this fucking...  But Sleeves is also simplifying Christmas in general.  It's not about buying...  When did you find that? 
[01:13:30]  I just visualized.  You are finding all kinds of hidden treasures in that song, aren't you?  Well, yeah.  No.  There's nothing in there.  He's not talking about the commercialization of Christmas.  That's a lazy fucking song.  He's bringing it back to the basics.  It's snow.  It's Christmas lights.  It's Christmas trees.  He didn't write words.  It's reflecting.  It's forgetting about all the other shit going on in the world.  Do you know that whole song was just la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la?  Yeah.  And he wrote a few words, couldn't rhyme them, and left the la-las where he couldn't fucking 
[01:14:00]  write.  Uh-oh.  Breaking news.  Keith has something on Sleeves.  Keith.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to tell you, Sleeves has another Christmas song.  I Christmas Thee.  Give it a try.  You may find it poignant and haunting.  What's it called?  I Christmas Thee.  I don't think I've heard this yet.  I Christmas Thee.  Do we have that, Travis?  Christmas Thee.  Wait, wait, wait. Start over.  Right now.  Does this guy have a merry fucking bone in his body?  Do you hear that? 
[01:14:30]  Do you like Leonard Cohen?  I do.  What?  All right.  Only when he's collapsing on stage.  Leonard Cohen doesn't sing happy songs for the most part.  He probably doesn't sing Christmas songs with that name.  They're kind of dark.  What?  All right, let's listen to this.  I Christmas Thief.  Christmas Thief.  A decorated tree.  It ain't a pile of branches or a special long TV. 
[01:15:00]  No.  It's a stand-in for another word.  You know this secretly.  I won't come out and say the word.  That's your discovery.  Now I'm with you.  I don't like this one.  I don't mind this.  I don't hate it, but. 
[01:15:30]  I like the la-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la-la.  Yeah?  Pirates and sailors and those lost at sea.  What?  He's just saying about the Somalis.  I don't know what you mean. 
[01:16:00]  What is I Christmas thee?  You don't like that?  You got another two minutes.  Holy shit.  Yeah, of course.  He fucking bumped it up a couple of.  Play it fast.  Can you play it fast?  Play it in fast motion. 
[01:16:30]  Play it even faster.  No, that's as fast as it goes.  It's not really fast, though.  It's kind of just up-pitched.  Yeah.  I'm with you on this one.  I want to hear it as the fucking chipmunks.  Now, that would be good.  Robbers and brigands of skull-duckery.  Oh, okay.  Criminals, vandals of darkness.  Alvin!  Alvin!  I like it now.  Hey! 
[01:17:00]  Right?  I might even like the La La La.  Play the La La La song fast.  Whoa, someone's saying the La La La La is crack.  Paul in Florida.  Paul.  Oh, stop.  Yes, you guys are completely missing the point.  It's not even a Christmas song.  It takes a lot of time on the La La La.  Kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Kill yourself.  All right, this guy's going to let you know what the song's about. 
[01:17:30]  James in North Carolina.  James.  How's up, folks?  Hey.  If Anthony would listen to this program on Sunday, it was Sleeve's Christmas Story.  It was the La La La La was about his life.  Gives a shit about his life.  What do you mean?  Wait, he actually...  Hold on.  Did Sleeve's actually explain the song on this channel?  Yeah, everything in the song was about his story.  The dancing on the La La La La was his skin on the ice and all that. 
[01:18:00]  Who killed what this guy, Mr. Fucking Important?  Can we find the actual explanation from Sleeve's?  Sorry, Hemingway.  We're not interested.  Why are we trying to interpret it?  When the artist can interpret it for everybody else and tell us exactly what he was getting at.  Is she smiling or frowning, La La?  Fucking out.  All right.  Thanks.  He's screaming on the bridge and La La La La.  The runaway run.  Right.  I want to hear it in fast motion.  Go ahead.  I want to see if I like it any better. 
[01:18:30]  Look, see?  It's a little more festive.  Wait a minute.  I was feeling pretty good.  La La La La.  Taking my time on the La La La La.  Theodore!  Simon!  Alvin!  La La La La.  Making all our heart with the La La La.  All right.  All right.  Making my way to the La La La La La.  La La La La La.  La La La La La.  See, it sounds a little better.  I'd like to drink a little beer.  Yep.  At the end of the day.  No more than it's time.  It sounds bright now.  Doesn't it sound bright? 
[01:19:00]  It's just happy.  It's going like a sea.  Like a sea above the beach.  I don't mind it now.  The lights popping in the trees.  The people shouting in the street.  And the people in the light.  All the children in the light.  Yeah.  Singing, holy, holy night.  No!  It's, it's, it's, it's more happy.  I think we made our point. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  I still don't like the words or anything.  I want, I want.  It sounds happier that way.  But maybe after the break, we could get Sleeves explaining what the fuck he's singing about.  What?  Why not?  Oh, oh, from his show.  If you get it on our channel, we might as well hear it.  Yeah.  I understand if you don't like it.  But, but the hatred is just, I don't get it.  To have hatred over someone's song.  I know, I know.  But it really brings a physical, like, pain to me. 
[01:20:00]  Like, it's physical.  I don't think there's a song out there where I would fucking feel hate.  I think it's lovely, Gregory.  You do, Ted.  I certainly do.  You like the la, la, la, la.  I certainly do.  I have an emporium.  La, la, la, la.  I sell extra lyrics in a la, la, la, la.  You should have bought some.  I sure should have.  What does the la, la, la, la mean to you, Ted?  I don't know.  It means something.  Well, what?  It means I have, I have hats and false teeth.  I'm feeling pretty good with my hats and false teeth. 
[01:20:30]  Put in your own words, Gregory.  That's funny.  Yeah, the other old guy with children all over his lap will be right back.  With more unforgettable holiday-themed Opin' Anthony moments.  See, I hear this and I start to feel it in my undershirts.  And Uncle Paul Christmas will continue next.  We're celebrating the season with classic holiday moments from the Opin' Anthony archives.  Here to bring you more is Uncle Paul.  Happy holidays.  It's your Uncle Paul holding your little hand and walking you through the holidays. 
[01:21:00]  We got some holiday spirit.  Everybody's laughing under the tree.  Unless you're one of the Jews.  And you're sitting in front of your goddamn bunch of candles.  Eight small presents.  I said, who did the Jews send to the mall for kids to sit on their lap?  They said, nobody, Paul.  I said, boo for the Jews. 
[01:21:30]  In this segment, Gregorio.  I love little Gregorio.  I remember when he was small.  And he'd hide up in the apple tree after I'd talk to him about the birds and the bees.  And I'd show him.  I'd show him exactly how you wet your finger.  And you rubbed the backside just to help it lubricate if the boy's constipated.  I said, I ought to call you Opie, you little cutie.  And I kissed his neck tenderly. 
[01:22:00]  In this segment, Opie talks about wanting to get a snowing Christmas tree.  Gets one.  And then the snow just winds up all over the apartment.  And now he's the same little Gregorio.  All right, with that said, we'll take a break.  I've got to find my Christmas tree that snows.  That is awful.  It's terrible.  Why wouldn't you do this?  They are.  They're little styrofoam pellets.  They're nice, right?  Yeah, I mean, the dogs would just eat them.  Oh, yeah, the dog's eating it.  The cat is shitting in the umbrella full of it. 
[01:22:30]  Styrofoam shit.  The cat's using it like kitty litter.  I don't have a cat.  And then at the top of the tree, there's just cat shit spurting out.  I don't have a cat.  So I don't have to worry about that shit.  Your 18-month-old kid would just get handfuls and throw it all over the house.  And I would if I came over.  I'm 43.  Yes.  How do you resist?  See?  See how festive that is?  Jimmy throwing the movie snow around my apartment.  Morella fucking sweeping it up constantly.  I would pick it up.  I would pick it up in my hands and I would just start going, here comes Santa Claus.  Here comes Santa Claus. 
[01:23:00]  Throwing it all about.  Throwing it.  Throw it all over.  You know what?  I'm going to make my own.  Fuck it.  I'm going to make my own.  I'm going to have it come out of the ceiling so it looks like it's really snowing.  How would you do that?  Huh?  How would you make it come out of the ceiling?  Plus that's going to be...  Well, not officially out of the ceiling, but it'll be a little pipe that you won't see  and then it's like maybe under a chandelier or something and then it's snowing above the  tree coming down. 
[01:23:30]  So you're going to be doing some major construction.  Instead of out of the top of the tree.  It's going to be totally impractical once December's over for that to be in your house.  Yeah, but it'll be a cool December.  How cool will my December be?  All right.  I can't give you that.  All right.  Snowing Christmas tree.  How many people are buying them now because of me?  No.  I hope far less.  Do I get a percentage of the sales?  Good luck.  Can I?  80%.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You think there's some out of work construction guys that could set up my room to snow from  the ceiling? 
[01:24:00]  I'm sure they can.  Because now I want to go all in.  I'll take their fake movie snow, but I want to distribute it differently than how they got  it set up.  So a giant umbrella in the room?  Yeah.  Why not?  Maybe a fan to blow the snow toward the tree.  Make it look more like a nor'easter snowstorm.  It's supposed to be bad luck to have an umbrella open in the house.  It's not an umbrella.  It just looks like an umbrella.  It's an upside down umbrella with a tree in it.  Some bitches couldn't open an umbrella.  How else are you supposed to collect the fake snow so it pops back up through the tree  to snow? 
[01:24:30]  You're not.  Like a garbage can.  Yeah.  It's just an awful white trash Christmas-y thing.  You don't like it?  No.  It shouldn't exist.  Why?  It's horrible.  What's wrong with it?  And it's humiliating that people bought it.  Why?  Like I feel bad for them that they have it in their house and they didn't realize.  No, they love it.  They're telling their friends.  They're like, check this out.  He flips the switch.  Look and it snows.  No way.  That's great.  Piece of shit umbrella tree.  Fucking tree is terrible. 
[01:25:00]  Why, you guys?  Ant gets to do fun stuff for Christmas.  Why can't I do fun stuff?  You can, but that's not fun.  You put all the lights on your house and stuff.  Decorate my house up.  I can't do that because I live in an apartment.  So it's easy for the delivery people to find my house.  I go, it's the one with the Christmas lights on it.  Look, the fantastic, fascinating, amazing, snowing Christmas tree.  It says it right there, Ant.  What's it going to say?  The shitty, white, trashy.  Yes.  Low class.  Low class. 
[01:25:30]  If it's in your house, kill yourself.  Wait, this one is the 15-inch snow-blowing fiber optic Christmas tree.  15-inch?  Wow, that might even...  How tall are these dumb trees?  Oh, it's tiny?  15 inches.  Oh.  Yeah, it's a foot and a half.  Foot and change.  Yeah, foot and a third.  Well, this one looks like it's in a little, like, bottle.  Oh.  Look at this one.  It's a snow globe.  All right, it's a snow globe.  That's fine.  You get a snow globe.  You shake it up.  Oh, what a nice midi fucking rendition of... 
[01:26:00]  All right, I don't like that one.  12 Days of Christmas sucks.  And I'll figure it out as we go to break, I guess, right?  Mm-hmm.  Feeling pretty good.  Snowing in the house.  La, la, la.  Feeling pretty good.  La, la, la.  La, la, la.  Making my way in the fa, la, la.  La, la, la.  Shit.  Standing in the leaves in the river.  Fa, la, la, la.  What's that?  Somebody made it.  It is an umbrella.  That's an umbrella. 
[01:26:30]  With a pole.  A pole.  And it's barely shooting one or two grains of...  Yeah, but that's not what I'm talking about.  That's the redneck version where someone tried to make their own.  Yeah.  Mine is going to be store-bought.  Only a redneck version.  Huh?  Look how dumb that looks.  This is also the redneck version.  By the way, putting it back in the box, you're going to have to get all those fucking balls.  You have to shake the leaves.  They're going to go all over the fucking floor.  You'll be stepping on them.  Yeah, you'll be finding those the whole year.  This guy's got carrots on his tree.  Peppers.  They're not peppers. 
[01:27:00]  Bell peppers.  Tree blows.  Well, then why is the store sold out if it sucks so bad?  They probably threw them out because everybody wrecked you on the property.  God, this is actually a house that has it in there.  Look at it in the corner.  It just looks so fucking humiliating.  Why?  That looks dumb.  It looks cool as shit.  You've got to light it better, though.  It looks like shit.  Yeah, with a flame in front of the lighting.  It's a nightmare.  You've got to light it.  The family has horrible presents for the kids, too. 
[01:27:30]  That's terrible.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  So I set up the snowing Christmas tree.  Oh.  It needs to be talked about for a couple minutes.  Holy shit.  The dumbest idea ever.  I will be putting video up later today.  Why was it a dumb idea?  Why?  Yeah.  Well, when you have a two-and-a-half-year-old, they don't understand what the snowy Christmas tree is all about.  He thinks it's way more fun, and it probably is in his mind, to take his cups, his bowls, whatever he could find, his buckets, and take the fake snow and throw it all over the house. 
[01:28:00]  I wish he wasn't a civilian.  Sometimes I wish I could throw my kid in the public eye, because I would have such great video, but I just don't want to do that with my kids.  But he has decided that it's way more fun to take his little hands and get his hands in the fake snow. 
[01:28:30]  The snowy Christmas tree, basically, it's a huge receptacle, and then the snow goes up the middle of the tree, and it comes out like a sprinkler on top.  So where the snow is all collecting, he's able to get in there, and he's just taking handfuls and throwing it on the ground.  He's putting what he calls his guys in the fake snow, all his army men and his dinosaurs and stuff, and he likes to throw them in there, which is clogging up the snowing Christmas tree. 
[01:29:00]  I have snow all over my fucking house, and this thing's only been set up for two hours.  You know what, though?  When you think about it, he's right.  The two-and-a-half-year-old is right.  Right.  That's what every non-rational person, like if you don't just ration it away, that's what you want to do.  You want to pick this shit up and just throw it.  That is more fun.  I know I'm the idiot here.  I assume, oh, a two-and-a-half-year-old would appreciate a snowing Christmas tree for what it was meant to do. 
[01:29:30]  No, man.  I remember as a kid, we all would use our toys in a different way, and he doesn't understand why he can't do that.  Well, he sees how wonderful the snow is coming down off the Christmas tree and realizes that that wonderment can be spread throughout the house.  Yeah.  You know the packing peanuts?  Yeah.  That's basically what the snow is.  Styrofoam, right?  Styrofoam.  It's in the tiniest of balls, where if you even try to sweep it up, it blows all over the place.  Just the sweep motion.  If you're sweeping lightly, this shit is so light that just the slightest breeze. 
[01:30:00]  And it's everywhere.  Or the slightest momentum just throws it everywhere else.  Do you have the one with the music?  Oh, sorry.  Do you have the one with the music?  Yes, I do.  Because, yeah, they just flipped on the music on this bad boy.  This thing is awesome.  See?  See?  This is the exact one I got.  This video kicks ass because it's nothing but the snowing Christmas tree, and it's four minutes and six seconds.  Oh, wow.  No, the video I made, which I haven't put up yet, will be 25 seconds. 
[01:30:30]  Here's my snowing Christmas tree.  Wow, what a dumb idea.  I want to see footage of the rest of your house with fake snow all over it.  It's everywhere.  And it's being tracked around the house like you would mud or snow when you come into your house.  Real snow.  And you can't scold him and be like, that's bad, because then it's like, well, I thought this tree was a source of happiness.  I spent, I set it up, and then I spent, like, off and on the next two hours trying to just constantly sweep up snow.  You didn't see this coming? 
[01:31:00]  No.  And now I've realized I'm just going to have this fake snow around my house, and I'm sure we'll be finding it in April and May.  Yeah.  I've given up sweeping up the fake snow because there's an adjustment there, too.  If it's all the way on high, which he likes to do, it doesn't fall back into the collector.  I'll call it the collector.  It goes out?  Like, it shoots out?  It kind of misses, sure.  So it feels like it's actually snowing in your house.  There's snow on the ground. 
[01:31:30]  Somebody needs a room.  And then he's scooping it up by the baby handful and just throwing it everywhere.  Do you know how much fun that must be?  I'm 44, and I'm thinking how great that would be to do.  If you're two and a half, that fucking rules.  Yeah, because there are no consequences.  There's no, like, this is a mess that's going to have to be cleaned out.  Who cares?  Just throw it.  And when I try to tell him, you know, to do something, his new thing is to tell me I'm  bossy.  That's what he says?  He goes, you're bossy.  Dad, you got to chill out.  We're having a snow party. 
[01:32:00]  God, I wish I was old school and just yelled and screamed.  It is kind of funny when he calls me bossy.  I'm like, all right, fuck.  Do you laugh when he does stuff like that?  Yeah, of course.  Is it like when you're bossy?  No, he goes, you're bossy.  I'm bossy.  I'm trying to keep the snow in the collector.  So he's literally now thinking, oh, if I throw snow around and call my dad bossy, it's a good  thing.  I get laughs.  And, you know, we opened the box and I'm thinking, okay, you know, he understands helping  a little bit.  Like, he gets all excited.  So I give him everything to put on the ground.  And it comes with these decorations. 
[01:32:30]  And I gave him a screwdriver.  I'm like, you know what?  He can handle a screwdriver two and a half just to make believe he's doing shit.  He took the screwdriver and started fucking punching holes in all the ornaments that it  comes with.  That's his first.  And then I gave him a little hammer.  I'm like, all right, you can tap a little, you know, tap, make believe you're fucking  helping me set this thing up.  And he's just breaking everything.  We're not supposed to give him like real tools.  Why?  That's why they make special plastic toys. 
[01:33:00]  But he does what adults want to do.  He does what we want to do.  He just hasn't been like, he doesn't know that he's not supposed to.  Right.  That's what I'd love to do to a box.  Just stab my fucking screwdriver and throw shit all over the house.  How great would that be?  That is your first instinct.  When you pick up a hammer, you just want to hit things.  Oh, fuck yeah.  You're right.  You're right.  Like, if you're hammering a nail into the wall, all you want to do is just start smashing  the wall.  I'm sure in his little fucking brain, he's having a blast.  But watching, it's like, oh my God.  So he threw, I mean, the ornaments that the snowing Christmas tree comes with aren't worth 
[01:33:30]  putting on the tree anyway, so.  Does your wife ask you why are you giving him screwdrivers that he wants to play with?  Nah, not really.  No.  Nah, he plays with scissors and all that shit already.  That's good, I guess.  Well, why not?  Maybe it'll, are you of the school of thought that if, you know, he has a slight accident,  he'll learn?  Like, you know what I mean?  No, he learns.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  He learns.  I mean, I'm supervising him when he's handling the tools. 
[01:34:00]  You're not going to let him cut his fingers off.  No.  So I don't know.  And then, of course, I hear from all the parents that they're like, of course it's the dumbest  idea ever.  You don't bring a snowing Christmas tree into your house with a two and a half year old.  It's the worst thing for me, Anthony Show.  I got a tree, Bobby.  Boy, you got a fake one or real one.  You love gadgets.  Oh my God, yes.  You can appreciate my fucking tree.  Is it a clap on, a clap off?  Oh no.  What?  It's the snowing Christmas tree.  What's that mean?  It actually snows. 
[01:34:30]  Shut the fuck up.  I know you're in.  It's.  I know you're in.  You'll love it.  Show him the snowing Christmas tree.  It's hilarious.  And I got it.  And my two and a half year old has decided that it's way more fun to take all the fake  fucking snow and throw it around the apartment.  I knew that would happen.  Did you set it up yesterday?  Oh yeah.  How'd it go?  I got a video.  I'll put up later.  What does your 16 and a half year old think about your trees?  Bobby.  Now, here's the snowing Christmas tree.  Fucking Edgar's fingernails.  Look, look. 
[01:35:00]  God, I hate him.  It's terrible.  There it is, Bobby.  The snowing Christmas tree.  Comes out like a sprinkler on top.  I understand.  But then look.  It's snowing.  Where does this fucking stupid snow go?  Look.  Into a big fucking collector.  Into an umbrella at the bottom.  And then it goes back into the tree.  Now, is it a vacuum thing or auger?  Look at Bobby's face.  He kind of likes it.  Oh, Bobby loves a gadget.  Where do you put the presents?  Around the tree.  Oh, you got to get another tree.  I'm going to have another tree.  This is like a goof tree. 
[01:35:30]  First of all, you can't have a cat.  If you have a cat with that.  Oh my God.  They're going to shit.  Shit comes spraying on the top of your tree.  That'd be hilarious.  The cat shits in it.  It gets picked up and just sprays shit.  That's true.  You can't have a cat.  You can't have a two and a half year old, I realize.  He decides he wants to fucking play in the fake snow and throw it around the house.  You can put trees under that, Bobby.  You put gifts under it.  No, not little trees.  You can put gifts under it.  Yeah, look.  See, you can do that.  Yeah, you got a fucking animal.  That thing's going to go.  You're just going to fucking see him.  Bobby, imagine if you had a pet monkey. 
[01:36:00]  Let's be honest.  You kind of like it.  You kind of like it.  I do like it.  You kind of like it.  Is that the tree comes with it?  That's not something you put on?  No, no.  What do you think?  You hollow the trunk out?  Yeah, I know.  You make those things individually.  The snowflakes.  Out of granite.  It's kind of good, right?  Bobby, is it a vacuum-y type thing?  Airflow?  Or is it a machine that augers the shit up?  I have no idea.  No?  Who got it?  You or your wife?  I actually kind of saw it in the store window, and my wife said, you know what? 
[01:36:30]  I'm going to make him happy, and she fucking ordered it.  I wasn't actually going to buy it.  Then you saw the Corleone gunned down headline in the paper.  Look at that.  Look.  It's snowing in your house.  How festive is that?  Okay, let me ask you a question.  Does it make a noise?  I imagine this.  No noise.  No noise.  It's got to be.  This is what you hear.  It's a fucking noise.  Oh, my God.  Well, you could go either music or no music.  I usually go no music.  That music stinks.  But you could go music.  It goes.  You hear the sound?  That's what rape victims hear in their head while they're being raped. 
[01:37:00]  Is that what you heard, Bobby?  Listen to the sound.  It sounds like it's snowing outside.  That's all you get.  How festive.  That's actually a nice...  That's pretty badass.  It is.  And then the branches all have snow on them.  I kind of like it.  That's pretty nice.  I know you like it.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  I get that.  This is made for you, Bobby.  Not so much for me and a two-and-a-half-year-old.  I don't like the big umbrella underneath.  I wish that was a little smaller.  Or it looked a little different than literally... 
[01:37:30]  It's literally an umbrella.  I don't know, but you can hang some shit.  You can fucking figure it out to make it look cooler.  That looks like the prototype, because it's an umbrella, it looks like the prototype the  guy made in the garage.  Now, what we're planning on having...  What we plan on having for the bottom is a container unit, but...  For right now, I use this umbrella from Costco, because it serves the purpose.  And they mean well, but you do get snow everywhere else, too.  It's not just going into the umbrella.  Yeah, it's got to bounce off of shit.  The kid doesn't eat that.  I got fake snow all over my house.  I've had it for two hours. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, God.  Before he went to bed last night.  You got to make sure...  There's snow everywhere, right?  Because if he eats that...  I eat it.  Is it...  I put mustard on, I eat that fucking shit.  He's good as far as not eating shit like that.  He's good so far, so...  I don't know.  I like it.  I'd get it.  Yeah?  I'd get...  Yeah, fuck yeah, it looks great.  How great is that?  It really is festive.  You can't fuck with that.  It's snowing inside.  Inside your house.  You got the snowflakes, boom.  They go up, boom.  Dude, they come out. 
[01:38:30]  They go all over you.  You got your presents, dude.  You got your plug.  Dude, you got your Christmas music.  Boom.  It's snowing inside, dude.  Like a Christmas at the Kellys.  Dude, you put your hat, your mittens on.  You feel like you're outside.  You try to sweep it up.  It goes whoosh all over because it's so light, dude.  They need to figure out something where it snows from your ceiling, though, instead of coming  out like a sprinkler at the top.  They have that.  It's called poverty.  Poor people.  But they'll figure that out. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, I'd get it.  Snow from the ceiling.  That wouldn't rule.  How could you get it?  It comes out like a sprinkler head at the top there where the star goes.  The only thing I don't like is the amount of snow in the bottom and the umbrella.  The bottom.  Fix the fucking umbrella and the bottom, and I'm good.  How are you going to catch the snow if you don't have an umbrella?  Come on, son.  You fucking made a tree that snows.  You can't figure out the last part that stinks?  I got a snowing tree in my house.  They need to drape some shit around the umbrella so it doesn't look like an umbrella.  You're right. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  You're right.  Oh, you know what?  Put some fake Christmas packages around there.  There you go, Bobby.  You're thinking.  Right.  Well, you can put the presents inside the snow.  Let the presents get snow on.  Ah!  The weather outside.  It's frightful.  The fire is so delightful, too, I hear.  I don't know what I'd say.  Uncle Paul is off explaining why the children's sheets smell like schnapps.  But he'll be right back with more holiday classics from the ONA Archives.  More of an Uncle Paul Christmas coming up. 
[01:40:00]  You're listening to classic holiday moments from the worst of the ONA Archives.  Keep the kids away from the mistletoe.  Uncle Paul is back.  I remember when Star Wars came out.  I got thrown out of the movie theater because of a misunderstanding.  I said to the boy next to me, hey, look at who's got a lightsaber in his lap.  Quick.  Quick.  Lean over and kiss the lightsaber before Darth Vader comes over. 
[01:40:30]  Kiss the lightsaber.  Oh, look.  My lightsaber's got a little Chewbacca hair on it.  Look at that.  Put your nose in the Chewbacca hair.  Give Chewie a kiss.  I remember this segment.  I didn't like it.  The guys decide to watch the old Star Wars holiday special for the first time.  I didn't care for that at all.  I didn't like Chewie.  What does that mean? 
[01:41:00]  This is the worst of all we had in Sirius XM.  Wow.  Yes, Jimmy.  What happened?  I heard some screaming from the office.  I just spent the last, say, six minutes in the office watching a copy of the Star Wars  holiday special.  Again, if I've seen it, I was fucking eight when it came out.  I don't remember it.  Yeah.  And I'm going to say, I'm going to include scat videos and animal fucking.  It's the least entertaining thing I've ever seen. 
[01:41:30]  Ever.  And it's so great to me because somebody had to approve this.  They watched this.  Like, Lucas did this, and they watched it, and it's got the fucking, the little fluffy  try-to-market-them characters, which is why I hate him, by the way.  The little baby Chewbacca's little son.  His fucking cunt of a wife and his fucking old man father.  Old mangy father.  And the first four minutes, there's a Han Solo introduction with Chewie, and then there's 
[01:42:00]  fucking four minutes of just Chewbacca family noise.  Grunting.  Just, four minutes straight.  And the father and daughter bring home her boyfriend and the father's, you know,  grr, grr, grr, grr.  And then, like, they're throwing in stock footage from the movie of Imperial Cruisers, and then 
[01:42:30]  they put Han Solo and Chewbacca in this poorly made set of the flight deck of the Falcon, and  it just looks really bad.  And they all, I guess, Lucas had to have somehow, I'm thinking, blackmailed them into doing that.  Like, why would they do that?  Because it was probably, at the time, when was that done?  Oh, it was right after the first one.  1998.  Oh, okay. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, 98.  That would explain.  Because Mark Hamill has prostate cancer in it.  And you know what it is?  It probably was before the second one.  They were like, let's ride the success out.  Yeah.  I didn't know they had an Empire Rehance.  Guys, you want to do that?  Yeah.  You know, I wasn't even thinking that.  They really weren't anybody back then.  All of them.  78.  They're just agreeing to do anything.  And it is so incredibly bad.  The special guests in it, and did you see the very beginning where they go, it's the 
[01:43:30]  Star Wars Christmas special.  Like, every announcer in the 70s had to yell during the intro to these things.  With special guest, Bea Arthur.  No, Beatrice Arthur.  Beatrice Arthur.  She's in it.  Yeah.  Jefferson Starship.  No shit.  Art Carney.  Art Carney is in it.  Hey there, Chewy Boy.  What about C-3PO Hawking Toys after the credits?  Oh, I don't remember that. 
[01:44:00]  I didn't see that.  There's like toy commercials.  There's the actual commercials that played during it, too.  I have to get it.  So that's kind of cool and nostalgic to look at.  You know, I think there's I Can't Believe I Eat the Whole Thing or some Legs Pantyhose  or some stupid thing.  I can't believe it.  We Got Short Shorts.  Oh, my God.  You know, with the chicks walking down the stairs.  Yeah.  We Got Short Short.  It's Heather Mills' version.  There's Got Short Short.  We hear you.  We've got it.  Yes.  You've Got Short Shorts.  Great.  Use narrative.  Fix your twats. 
[01:44:30]  Is it on that 70s fucking muff?  Your pubis isn't fucking blowing hair out the sides of your legs.  You're fucking, you're fucking Mons, Mons, whatever it's called.  Mons Venus.  Mons Venus.  Your labia majora.  Is not fucking poofing hair out, you fucking 70s chimp.  We know.  Mons Venus.  Mons Venus.  You want to hear the opening scene with Han?  Dude, I want to hear the.  And Chewbacca?  When they introduce the fucking people playing and they have Chewbacca's family's names. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  I almost bit Sam's ear.  Do we have the opening credits?  Hmm?  Not on that CD.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, it better be one second.  I say a half a second.  You're too generous.  Half a quarter.  All right.  Get it in a quarter second.  All right.  In the meantime, we got this.  All right.  Thank you.  I can't get enough of her.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad. 
[01:45:30]  I'm new.  I want everybody singing the hook at home, by the way.  Make sure you sing.  Don't ruin it here.  I want to hear her.  I'm watching you on Pal Talk.  Sing the hook.  Is enough enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  Swine.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign. 
[01:46:00]  No one's going to drag you up.  To get into the light where you belong.  We'll come here to you.  Oh.  And then she tries to get all sexy in the end after.  Swine.  I saw the swine.  Wind is blowing.  It's like she's on the fucking, the wing of that fucking Virgin Airline to try to land.  Holy shit.  She's all nervous.  Popping her peas.  Breathing heavily into that shitty mic.  I just can't get enough of that though.  I saw the swine.  Oh.  All right.  We can do the opening scene as we get that other piece of audio. 
[01:46:30]  It is fucking bad.  We'll start here and then we'll go backwards when we get it.  Dude, it's so bad.  Opening scene with Han.  No, this is going forward.  This is correct.  This is the right order.  That was Han's scene was first.  No, I understand.  But we want to get audio, the intro of the whole show we don't have yet.  Right.  Oh, okay.  I thought that came after.  I thought this was a cold open as they say.  Oh, okay.  Is it?  I could be wrong, but I just wanted to throw a short.  It's got to be in chronological order.  So far, I think I saw the Han solo first, then the intro came after it. 
[01:47:00]  Here's Han and Chewbacca.  That's it.  I'm turning back.  I know your family's waiting.  I know it's an important day.  All right.  We'll give it a try.  I'll set your coordinates.  You won't jump far.  I'll get you back there in time, pal.  Trust me.  Our only hope now is I'll run that Imperial Garbage Scout, though.  I'm going to Lightspeed. 
[01:47:30]  Douche Chills.  That's the spirit.  You'll be celebrating Life Day before you know it.  Stand by.  Here's the sake of my arm and cousin's friends.  Oh.  What?  I don't know, but I know I should have heard someone say weak-chinned idiot to describe the  fucking director.  Yeah.  Dude, it's fucking Life Day.  And hence his acting's not even day.  His acting's not even day.  What does that even mean?  Life Day.  I'm so glad I'm your present. 
[01:48:00]  Life is really new.  Oh, did you bother?  You're not the one for me.  Ooh.  There's Chewbacca.  Enough, enough, enough.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong. 
[01:48:30]  How close do you belong?  She starts going breathy on this.  It gets funnier every time you hear it.  All right, back to the Star Wars holiday special.  And thank you to whoever got me my plain fat-free yogurt that is vanilla-flavored.  Here's the two minutes of Wookiees.  Of the Wookiees talking.  Oh, God. 
[01:49:00]  Dude, if you don't want to fucking cave somebody's head in.  What happened?  What?  What's going on?  What happened?  Oh, no.  Who called you to come in?  Why?  Eric, why?  Ask Eric why.  To the yogurt.  Eric.  Who decided that they should disrupt the show?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Of course it would be Iraq again.  Eric, do you want to just explain?  Because all of a sudden this gentleman walked in.  He got your yogurt. 
[01:49:30]  He got the wrong yogurt.  I sent him in to fix it.  To go and get the right yogurt.  I got your yogurt.  Iraq, while you're in here, did you get your jingle ball tickets?  Yes.  Ugh.  You want a jingle ball?  Yes.  Oh, you made me know.  Wait, wait.  Who's playing?  Get me the line up.  I don't remember.  The Killers.  All right.  Evanescence.  Justin Timberlake.  Oh, okay.  That's who you're going for.  And there's three or four more.  I can't remember.  And in that three or four more lays the reason he is going. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  Although, Justin Timberlake, I'm really starting to like and I don't want to, but I can't help it.  I have that fucking...  What's that song about the...  I Got a Cock in My Mouth?  No, no, no.  That's his mantra.  How could you like Justin Timberlake?  What's the one song he's got that's...  I don't know.  That's just it.  Eric.  Sexy Back.  That's it.  It's good.  And what is it?  What is the gist of that song?  That he's bringing the sexy back?  Pretty much.  But it's a good song.  Thanks.  Do we have any of it, Bill?  All right.  All right, Bill. 
[01:50:30]  This is not bad.  Tribe generic bullshit.  It's a good club song.  How many songs sound like this?  Yeah.  I like this one.  Why couldn't this just be K-Fed?  I love K-Fed. 
[01:51:00]  More K-Fed.  This could just be K-Fed.  You going to sing along with it?  At the Jingle Ball?  No.  No.  He's going to pump his fish in the air.  I'm going to rave.  I'm going to do some X or some E.  Whatever they call it.  All right, I got the lineup for the Jingle Ball.  By the way, the only reason I know that he's going to the Jingle Ball  is because he gave me his tickets by accident in a DHL package.  Or he would have flew under the radar.  How'd you get him?  What a slip up. 
[01:51:30]  They weren't my tickets.  They were actually Rich Voss' tickets.  And Voss had to turn them down, so I got them.  Why?  Do you think fucking Parliament Funkadelic was playing there, that fucking old man?  I'm sure they were for his kids.  But I got to buy their love.  There's Sly and the Family Stone playing.  Fucking stupid Voss and his old man taste.  The person he contacted for the tickets actually gave me the voicemails that Voss left with him  to try to get the tickets.  Oh, okay.  Are they good?  Yeah.  He insists that he's a television star and that maybe they need a presenter to bring out one of the bands. 
[01:52:00]  Are you shitting me?  No, he doesn't.  He's pitching himself while he's asking for free tickets.  Oh, he's great.  Problem?  No.  You got these, didn't you, Than?  No, he just deflects the focus so well.  Now it's all about Voss.  Yeah, you know what?  But if he's got Voss voicemails.  Damn it.  That's right.  He looks out today.  I hate that he put his shields up.  Go track two?  Mm-hmm.  Our shields are brought up.  Hi, this is Rich Voss. 
[01:52:30]  Rich Voss.  Hey, if by any chance you have three zoo tickets kicking around, my daughters keep bothering me.  But I hate to put you in a position and ask for these.  I'll even pay for them or whatever.  It's a tongue in a position when I say that word.  Or if they cost anything or whatever.  Let me know.  Give me a call either way.  But there's no pressure.  If it can happen, it can happen.  If it can't, well, tough shit on them, huh?  All right.  I'll be at Caroline's tonight, too.  Like at 730. 
[01:53:00]  He's plugging.  Bye.  What a vulture.  The end of that message should be, have you checked the children?  That creepy voice he has.  You hear the breathing?  The Jew.  He's calling from upstairs.  You hear the breathing?  You hear the breathing?  Get out of the house.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hi.  It's Rich.  Rich Voss.  We traced the call.  It's coming from a bank.  That's the only one?  Track three, too.  Track three.  He called back.  Hey.  Rich Voss. 
[01:53:30]  What's going on?  Rich Voss.  A couple of things I have to talk to you about.  I want to find out about that Jingle Bell.  Whatever it's called.  Jingle Bell.  I don't know.  My kids keep bothering me.  What day it is.  Maybe if I get some tickets.  You know, maybe I'll even introduce if you need.  You know, I can introduce a band or two.  I'm kind of well known, you know.  It wouldn't hurt.  Oh, my God.  Anyhow, give me a call.  I hope all as well.  I'm working around your area coming up in Jersey.  And somewhere there.  Around there.  All right.  I'll talk to you later. 
[01:54:00]  You have a lovely day.  Bye.  Who did he leave these messages for?  A friend who works over there, Dave.  Oh, my God.  The guy that does the song parodies?  Maybe you need me to introduce Justin Timberlake with the Killers, you fucking ass.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage, Rich Voss.  That's right.  Crickets, crickets, crickets, crickets, crickets.  Oh, boy.  Crickets, crickets, crickets.  Crickets, crickets, crickets. 
[01:54:30]  We got them?  I got the one moment, please sign.  Yeah.  I saw the swines.  All right.  Now we don't have them?  All right.  Oh, damn it.  All right, we'll enjoy it.  Fucking Bill is dressed like every wacky beach guy from an 80s movie.  Oh man  Bill gave me his 20 year plan the other day  What is his 20 year plan 
[01:55:00]  Who has a 20 year fucking plan  Maintain for 19 years and then improve  We all went out to lunch  I didn't hear you Jimmy  You missed nothing  We all went to lunch  And I decided to sit across from Bill  I said Bill how's it going  And we got into talking about his 20 year plan  Which is to live in the woods by himself  Like who  Is this on the air or just  In our headphones  My plan was one day just to do something 
[01:55:30]  Really successful and then disappear  Like J.D. Salinger  Just take it all for granted  The key is to one day do something  Successful  So that you can then leave and people would notice  That you're gone  You would live in the woods or something right  Like a mountain man  You could grow one of those beards  Siberia  Siberia  So you want to go somewhere really remote  Yeah  Alright  Alright  Wow that's a 20 year plan  You know some people just have simple plans  That's a unique plan  Yeah

[02:05:00]  through space for that and han solo and fucking harrison's ford acting in that clip stunk because  you know something uninspired drivel yeah he's he's believe me he's not the best actor and uh he uh  he obviously did not want to do this looked at it like it's dog shit and didn't want to fucking do it  but he had to sit there and act like first of all they're supposed to be like intergalactic smugglers  the guy kills people you know he kills uh other other little alien things and things that are 
[02:05:30]  threatening his life runs from the law smuggles things he's a criminal yes and there he is i'll  get you home to your family but what is it what does chewbacca's family think that he's a criminal  that chewbacca's a fight he's a criminal he wants to get home for life day life day what does that  mean they all hang out in the treehouse and do what yeah i don't know chewbacca fingers his wife and  tells the father he's a burden and tells the kid he was a mistake yeah and then the fucking like  it was like christmas in the projects pretty much because the cops wind up coming to the house 
[02:06:00]  the uh imperial uh uh stormtroopers come to the house looking for chewbacca yeah and they cover for  him and say no we don't know where it is i don't know how does every fucking person speak that awful  language oh how does han solo speak it yeah how do you understand that it is such garbage that lucas 
[02:06:30]  tried to pull every single copy from existence and it does nothing but sell like hot cakes at star  wars conventions they all want a copy everyone wants one and every nerd that's worth their salt  has a copy why by the way did did he approve this it had to be approved by him i think again back then  he was thinking you know this is a one hit wonder star wars thing it's got some momentum let me  capitalize while i can and real didn't realize it was going to go to fucking you know 30 fucking 
[02:07:00]  years of milk in this cow and by the way why doesn't this fucking no self a humor asshole just  release it and say it's one of the worst things ever done on dvd people would buy it yeah why not  just admit what it is hey it was a bad move it's 28 years ago he cannot up the commentary would be  hilarious yes he wants to i hear take themselves too seriously not possibly fit any more money  in the lucas vault yeah you like to tamp it down harrison ford going oh my god look at how awful  i am in this scene i just was uninspired we hated the script make fun of it yeah uh uh princess leia 
[02:07:30]  let uh carrie fisher talk about how she was doped up singing that song at the end she sings a song  and she is so drugged out of her mind and mark hamill in in his big scene uh with r2d2  is wearing so much makeup it is embarrassing to watch i have to see i have to get a copy of the  whole thing yeah how long is it it goes on forever dude it is like two fucking hours long 
[02:08:00]  and doesn't does doesn't be arthur say god's gonna get you for that darth  she plays the bartender at that cantina that you love so much  and she's the she's the like real spicy bartender giving some guff to the people at the bar hey  you my cock's a lot bigger than yours fucko and that you know awful elephant playing the piano  with his big dumb elephant fingers i i want to fucking tie lucas up and make him watch that while 
[02:08:30]  i rape him the the mute fuck his little backside the the musicians playing this absolutely looked like  like asses with clarinets shoved up their asses and that's how they were playing the music  big asses clarinet shoved in the asshole they look like puppets then you got some well just no no i just 
[02:09:00]  like sitting here oh um no they obviously had no budget for it yeah so they want something exciting  to happen so halfway through uh the movie they just switched to a cartoon yeah it was a right out of  out of nowhere a cartoon uh with the animated characters i and that had nothing to do really  with what was going on in with the plot that thick plot of the the special itself and then my favorite  was um the scene with the old uh uh grandpa there what was his name midge me 
[02:09:30]  he's sitting there and he gets a present that is diane carroll i guess doing an  erotic dance in miniature she's like a little miniature thing and he is what amounts to in  in in wookie jerking off to her doing this exotic dance to interspliced music and and video of the  jefferson starship right right it is fucking all over the place and i'll bet you why they did the 
[02:10:00]  cartoon they probably wanted to stretch it for x amount of time to get the commercials in and they  probably read out of materials they said let's do the cartoon or was to advertise the cartoons they  were going to fucking show on saturday morning let's go to schwogie schwogie hey hey boys what's  going on first appearance of boba fett yes it was in that car was it really yes yeah hold on  a little trivia go ahead hey hey boys hey let's know this whole thing is available on youtube you  gotta hunt around because they broke up in parts travis told me that that the whole thing was up 
[02:10:30]  there if they took it down but you can find this whole thing on youtube i just saw part of it on  youtube that's why i couldn't see how shitty the set anthony mentioned the set was bad like the uh  when they were in the appearance of the ship yeah the flight deck set is so bad it is not the flight  deck that they had in the movie obviously it's just some cheap little thing that shakes a little bit  and it's just so bad and then they use all the stock footage well let's get the millennium falcon  let's get to princess leia uh doing her little song okay here's carrie fisher who knew she could  sing and the best part about the fucking father was when he was yelling at chewbacca and he goes 
[02:11:00]  now the earthlings at kenner have asked my associate and me to present the star wars collection  truly remarkable toys and games for your ah yeah there's the pitch that's what the whole  fucking special is about george there's the pitch well this is labeled uh i must have flipped those  it's coming around christmas time so you gotta sell you gotta sell uh yeah okay life's day  princess lair this holiday is yours but we all share with you the hope that this day is

[02:13:30]  To choke her out  This is what people  Who enjoyed the movie Star Wars  Wanted to see  Apparently not, he pulled every copy  People don't realize  That  This got the voice  Oh no, wait, what happened?  Oh no, shut up 
[02:14:00]  Yes  Get her with the Imperial Taser  Is there anything else you want to play off this?  I'm so annoyed  Yeah, watch it  We got more Wookiee talking  We got Art Carney, Jefferson Starship  Let's hear Art Carney, what does he do?  He's got to be awful  He's the comic relief  What does he do?  He's a handyman, I think  Or something like that  Yes, he's the one that took images of Lumpy 
[02:14:30]  And put them on his hard drive  And was file trading with Gary Glitter  Look at this Wookiee cock  Hit it, Lumpy boy  He would  When I was a boy  My favorite thing was the Star Wars Holiday Special  It actually brought a smile to my face  When the Wookiees were hugging  Horrid 
[02:15:00]  Excuse me  I've got a wall screen customer  Good to see you again  Don't say a word, madam  I know just why you're calling  You're wondering when that shaggy carpet you ordered  Will arrive at your home  Let me assure you, madam  It's on its way  You know, tonight especially for you  By a little old woman  Four planets away  She did it all by herself  In fact, you might say  She did it by hand  Solo  So it's going to take some time to get to you 
[02:15:30]  Speaking in code  I know you understand  Understand, right?  Driving  By the way, I'll be by later  To drop off that extra proton energy pack  You're welcome  That's right  He was getting messages from Han Solo and Chewie  As to when they were going to arrive  And had to convey that message to them  But it in code  Because, you know  The Empire  They were listening  So he used such a tricky code  Shaggy carpet 
[02:16:00]  Shaggy carpet  And then Han Solo  That's a good one  That code was only trumped by the code in Star Trek  Where if we go by the book  It will take three days  If days seem like hours  How long will it take?  Three days  By the book  Get it?  And there's Khan  Supposed to be some super fucking human intelligence 
[02:16:30]  And everything  I can't figure out the code  He tasks me  He tasks me  But I shall have him  With his tricky code  Yeah, if we go by the book  Days will seem like hours  How long to fix it?  Three days  If we go by the book  Could that be a fucking code?  That's maybe what  That's what they figured  Khan would just go  That can't possibly be a fucking code  It must really be three days  Wow  And the whole time  Fucking 
[02:17:00]  Art Carney  Is talking in code  The cameraman  Is blinking out torture  Uh oh  Uncle Paul's got Santa's list  And he's off  Looking for the naughty children  Mighty only one  With a raging  Hot on  But he'll return  With more classic  Holiday moments  From the ONA archives  Next  A very warm  Happy holiday  To you and yours  From the Opie and Anthony channel  Huh?  Sit back and enjoy 
[02:17:30]  More classic  Yule themed moments  From the ONA archives  As an Uncle Paul Christmas  Continues  Ah sure  I remember this next one  This is where Anthony  Talks about buying presents  At the last minute  He's a very last minute  Boy  He always was  He'd always be playing  With the little  The little dolls  And he'd tell his father  It was a puppet  And his father  Would call him a fag  And he'd go  Paul  Straighten my boy out 
[02:18:00]  So what I'd do  Is I'd lay him in bed  And we'd do like  The little puppet show  From the Sixth Sense  Except I wouldn't put  Persian inside of his soup  I'd put my own  Special batch  Of healing juice  I'd stand over his soup  While I did the puppet show  And sprinkle my own  Healing juice  In his soup  Little Tony  Tony  Boboni  Banana  Fana  Fofoni  And then I'd kiss him  On his stomach  Here he talks about 
[02:18:30]  Buying presents  At the last minute  You know what he used to like  For Christmas  When you'd open  The front of his PJ's  You'd open a little hole  And his little Italian  Peter would fall out  And you'd go  And he would giggle  Ha ha  Uncle Paul  He tells a story  About Christmas Eve  Oh God  I hope it ain't that one  The one where  He was laughing  Like lovers  Oh and he drunkenly  Falls on the ice  On his patio  I don't know what it was 
[02:19:00]  Maybe it was them memories  That forced him  Into alcoholism  Ha ha ha  Christmas morning  He got pulled over  Heading to his parents' house  Sure  Being a good parent  Is important  I've always been  A good fodder  I was always there  For the school plays  When I wasn't in jail  Or with that  Megan's law  When I was allowed  Next to the schools  I'd go to the play  And go  Yay  You want a Snuggie

[02:25:00]  Make them as they get ordered because there's only three people that want a Snuggie and I hope they're really flammable like I hope what gives them their great color is the gasoline type of color dye that you have to use you have a cigarette because the same people also sell like face burn bandages  You can't get out of your Snuggie because you're all sleeved in there you can't just throw it off like a flaming blanket you drop and roll and it just wraps around you like burning plastic  Nice  Just sticks to your body  Hey here's the Snuggie commercial  Oh  You want to keep warm when you're feeling chilled  But  All right then turn up the heat or get a stupid blanket  Get a blanket  No no blanket listen she'll tell you why a blanket sucks 
[02:25:30]  Oh I'm sorry  Yes  I'm the dummy  I'm the dummy  The woman in the commercial is actually nailing the blanket to her cab so it doesn't fly off  Get a hold of yourself miss  It's a blanket  It's a dumb blanket  She acts like it's a wolverine she's trying to put on herself  Panic stricken  You want to keep warm when you're feeling chilled but you don't want to raise your heating bill  Blankets are okay but they can slip and slide and when you need to reach for something your hands are trapped inside 
[02:26:00]  Now there's the Snuggie  Trapped inside  What is she talking about  Your private pile  You can get trapped and beaten but with soap  Who's ever had to call 911 to be taken out of a blanket because you couldn't get bonbons with a remote control  Dummies  What was the private pile  Has anyone ever had a problem with a blanket  No  I'm trying to think if I've ever had a real problem with a blanket 
[02:26:30]  One time honestly I was watching TV and I was going to reach for something  And when I reached my arm out the blanket kind of came off my arm  Oh no  So I had short sleeves on and the arm was temporarily chilly  But then I got what I was supposed to get and I took the blanket with the hand that was still covered  And I flipped it over and then my other arm was covered too  It was fine again  So you didn't even need sleeves on a blanket  No but it would have been so nice because I wouldn't have gotten that little chill that I got  Yeah  When I was reaching for the lubricant 
[02:27:00]  And how about the fact that your hands are sticking out and cold  Like part of the blanket is getting your hands under the air  I'm sure they figured it out  Getting all warm  No they haven't  Oh no  Look she's reading a book  And her hands are sticking out  She's wearing a backwards robe  It's a robe straight jacket  Tie it in a knot in the back and beat your grandma  And she wears a stupid Snuggie  Yeah but you got easy access to grandma's backside  Yeah  And who doesn't want that  Yeah you can take a dump in it while you're still nice and warm 
[02:27:30]  That's what they call the dump blanket  It comes like on the top thing  It's like a toilet paper roll holder  And when you need to reach for something  Your hands are trapped inside  Now there's the Snuggie  The blanket that has sleeves  The Snuggie keeps you totally warm  And gives you the freedom to use your hands  She's describing clothing  Yeah  Or read a book in total warmth and comfort 
[02:28:00]  It's a dress  Use your laptop without being cold  Or enjoy a snack while staying snuggly warm  Ew if they use another version of the word Snuggie  Snuggie  Sounds like a fetish  I'm a Snuggie  Right  My daughter's a Snuggie lover  Kind of has that plushie right  Yeah  I know where you're going  Yeah the  I'm into plushies  That was all over the place though 
[02:28:30]  For Christmas  I swear to god  This is the first I'm hearing of the Snuggie  I've been a little out of touch  I've been a little out of touch  It looks like  Tom on Long Island  He's got a little more on the Snuggie  Tom  Hey what's up guys  Jimmy I love the book man  Thank you very much  The best part about the commercial fellas  Is that they're at a sporting event  The whole family wearing Snuggies  Looking like a cult  Will they high five each other?  Yeah  They did  Show that day  He's right  They're like in the bleachers  Yeah there they are  I wouldn't wear that to a game  That's embarrassing 
[02:29:00]  Watch them high fives  That's embarrassing  Watch the Snuggie family high fives  So the snipers know who to hit  I hope that's why they're wearing the Snuggies  He hates these Snuggies  Yeah they high five  Ah yeah  But the cold dorm room was good  When it goes  And those  Drafty dorm rooms  Look at her  And you know the back is easy access  Because it's open like a blanket  She's dating two players  From the same basketball team  And they don't know it  So she has two different colored Snuggies  Because each time one comes and leaves 
[02:29:30]  They stain it  Yo why is your Snuggie  Standing up by itself  That's machine washable  Hold on  What is it  How else would you wash it  No  Harlequin girl from Buffalo writes  My grandmother bought my husband a Snuggie  But she got him the generic one  From Harriet Carter I guess  Local something maybe  It needs to be assembled around you  With snaps  Which he's too lazy to do  So he walks around the house  In this cape like a superhero 
[02:30:00]  Snuggie  With snaps  What is this one  What's this one  Dave  How are you Dave  How's it going guys  My sister bought my mom  It's the QVC version  Called a flanket  And when my mom opened it  On Christmas morning  She started crying  And my sister's like  What's wrong  And she's like  Are you putting me in a nursing home  Because I can work a blanket  What's wrong with you  I'm so good to you  Crying when she gets a Snuggie 
[02:30:30]  That's one of those  Absolutely terrible  That's one of those  We should have a list  But it's one of those gifts  You get somebody  That you don't give a crap about  Here take this Snuggie  Take this Chia Pet  Take this  Crappy gifts  You're off my dumb list  So what is the slanket  It's just the same thing  Same thing as a Snuggie  A sleeved blanket  Yeah  Slanket  Slanket  I hate when they combine words  Stop it  Why  Don't do that  They're fun Jimmy  It's not 
[02:31:00]  They're fun  It's not  Unless they're combining  Like who's your friend  Oh he's a Canadian runt  Boo  Ah boo  John in Orange County  Yeah how you doing  Alright  Listen my mother-in-law  Bought us five Snuggies  For Christmas  And I think they're made  Out of the same material  As ShamWow  The na-thief  Absolutely ridiculous 
[02:31:30]  Yeah the ShamWow  Is another big  Biggie  Yeah  That's  Yeah but let me tell you  Let me tell you something  It's Snuggie  I feel like I'm in the church  Quiet when I put it on  Yeah  You know  Fernando brings up a good point  I'm sure  Fernando  I'm sure they'll dump out  Down the hall  But someone out there  Will hear this  Go ahead Fernando  Hey what's up guys  Great show  I just wanted to point out  That if you got the Snuggie  And you're a guy  You're trapped under the Snuggie 
[02:32:00]  You can't  You can't masturbate  If you're  If you're watching  Porn on the computer  Or through on a DVD  Yeah true  You're trapped under it  And you can't  There's no access  To your  You get busted easier now  There's no access  To your Peter  The Snuggie should have  Like a little doggy door  On the front  It's all a conspiracy man  I hear ya  They want us to join cults  No  Well  You know the thing's  Just falling off  Of your shoulders  It's awful  Stand up  Oh yeah  It's not connecting  So  We went off on a tangent  Oh yeah  I was talking about  Presents and stuff 
[02:32:30]  And how we had to  Do Secret Santa  So I only have to get  One gift for  For somebody  We  On Thanksgiving  We actually  Pass around the old hat  Pull the names out  We gave up on that  But we did that for years  And then Christmas  You get that person  A gift  Does the person  That pulled your name  Just try not to  Show the  Over the top excitement  Like oh  No because they  Got to get me something  Oh it goes like  It's a secret  So I pick a name  And I have to get  Somebody something  But they don't know  It's from me  Okay I gotcha  So I got my uncle  And decided 
[02:33:00]  Because he likes  Wine  To get a really  Really really  Good bottle of wine  A decanter  Nice decanter  To a decant  I got four of those  If anybody needs one  A decanter  What's a decanter  What did you do by the way  It lets the wine breathe  It's  Yes  Just another  Excuse to  Buy  Just stuff  Open it and drink it  No the guy at the wine store  Told me  This has to breathe  For an hour  He goes  Pour some in a glass  And then pour the rest  In the decanter  And then  Taste the glass 
[02:33:30]  And then taste  What's in the decanter  It lets some of the alcohol  Burn off a little bit  I've heard all that  But I can't tell  Dude  It really is  It was  And it was an amazing  Bottle of wine  Very good  But  Well  I was drinking a lot of wine  On Christmas Eve  A lot of wine  And  Then  Yeah I went home  And  The thought  Once I got home  Thank god  You got a driver  Woof  I put the cruise control on 
[02:34:00]  One less thing I have to worry about  Is how fast I'm going  And then I keep it  In the right lane  And you calculate  What's the speed  Because you don't want to be perfect  Because that  That's suspicious  About 62  62 is the speed  About 62  In a 35 zone  Over lawns  Knocking over mailboxes  Driving through people's backyards  Yeah  Got wine in the car 
[02:34:30]  Yeah  So  Well I got home  Although the next day  Keith did tell me  He goes  Your truck was a little  In the middle of the driveway  Usually you're  You know  One side or the other  But I didn't think  I was just parking for room  So I  I get home  It's Christmas Eve  On the way  By the way  On the way  I'm thinking  I might go to the carousel  Of course  And if I had gone there  I would have drank beer 
[02:35:00]  And it would have  Just put me over the top  One brain cell  That was left  In my head  That hadn't been affected  Told me  No  Just go home  You idiot  That's some responsibility  That's nice  So I went home  Not the responsibility  We're hoping for  But alright  And now I got pumps  On my pool cover  Right  Pumps the water off  You know  How wasted were you  I was doing pretty good  I was doing pretty good  So I go  I go out back  With a flashlight  Because I had to defrost  The pumps 
[02:35:30]  Before I left  So I go out  To check  When the pump's working  So I get the  Little flashlight  I go out back  And there was a strip of ice  It had to be  I don't know  12 inches long  By  By  Five inches wide  Nothing  And I slipped on that ice  And went down  And it was after midnight  So it's officially Christmas  So the neighbors  Got to hear  Santa  Yelling the C word  The F word  The S word  I was screaming curses 
[02:36:00]  As I'm just laying down  On my patio  What kind of fall  Was it like a cartoon fall?  No it was a  Quickly on your back  It was a  My left foot  Went out from under me  I went down  On the side  Of my kneecap  And the side  Of my elbow  Which  Really hurt  Not at the time  At the time  I'm just like  Ah  I just fell  That sucks  So then  I finally  You know  Go to bed 
[02:36:30]  You're like the old lady  From the medical alert commercial  I've fallen  My son Michael  Got me the life call alert  So I  Went to bed  And now my party  Is Christmas day  Which I've told everybody  To come over  At 2 o'clock  Family  Friends  Yes  Catered  Yes  All in  Told everyone  2 o'clock  Right  It's not bad  I think it was about  3 in the morning  When I finally got  To sleep  Plenty of time  Plenty of time  I woke up  At 9 in the morning 
[02:37:00]  With one of the worst  Hangovers  In history  It was so bad  That I was just  My head was pounding  And spinning  I was  Woofing  You puked?  Oh yeah  I was just puking  Aren't you too old  To be puking?  My hangovers are bad  I don't puke  When I'm drunk  Like some people  Puke when they're drinking  I'll puke  Hours later  Sometimes a day later 
[02:37:30]  I'll puke  Jeez  It's horrible  My hangovers are terrible  Hangovers are directly proportional  To how good of a time  You were having  The night before  Because what fun I had  That's a sign  From God  It's not  It's alcohol  God is telling you something  And so now  It's starting to creep up  I'm laying in bed  I got a wet rag on my head  And I'm writhing in pain  And I'm looking  At the clock  And time is flying by  And I'm not getting any better  And I'm thinking 
[02:38:00]  It's going to come up  On two o'clock  And I'm not going to be able  To even answer the door  What does the wet rag do?  It just keeps my head cool  And my eyes  And my head hurt so bad  That the coolness feels good  So I took some aspirin  And that  And I'm drinking water  Like crazy  Just trying to feel better  And thank God  I get a text from Keith  That says  I'll be over in a little bit  I'm like  Doors open  So I  Trod downstairs  Unlock the door  Go back upstairs  Puke a little more 
[02:38:30]  Lay down in bed  And figure  Keith is there  Everything's taken care of  Two o'clock rolls around  I start hearing people coming  To the party  And I'm still in bed  I'm laying in bed  I don't think I got  What time did I come downstairs?  Do you remember what time  I came downstairs?  It had to be  It had to be  Probably  After five  In the afternoon  Yeah  After five  So they had been there 
[02:39:00]  Over three hours  Yeah over three hours  And you made your appearance  They had dinner  Yeah everybody ate already  They ate  They did presents  Everything  I wasn't at my own party  Oh my God  I missed my party  I came down  Everybody was still  You know hanging out  A little dessert  Playing some games  Doing things  There he is  When you walk down the steps  Yeah  It was like  Oh well  Look who decided  Yeah look who decided  I got that one 
[02:39:30]  Hey where you been  Oh well glad you could make it  Welcome to the  Alright  Get out  They're all doing their  Get out  They're all doing their  Ryan Seacrest impressions  Making believe  They're you know  I swear to you  I'm just kind of  Not acknowledging  What's happening  In front of their eyes  I wanted to unload on them  Like Dwight Yoakam  In Sling Blade  Get out of my house  Get out  Retard  Retard  Push the guy in the wheelchair 
[02:40:00]  Into the door  Amazing  Oh is he fantastic  Yeah so  I was  A hurting  And then  You know the weird thing  About a bad hangover is  You have one beer  And you say to yourself  I really wasn't  Feeling that bad  How could I have  Felt so bad  You have to have  The prescription beer  Medicinal beer  The first sip  Is horrible  But then once you're 
[02:40:30]  Done with the beer  You go  Did I really feel  That bad  How many beers  Did you end up having  Knowing you had  This horrendous hangover  Going  Oh and then that night  You just keep going  Until you know  You go back to sleep  And then you wake up  And feel better  Because you know  I wasn't drinking wine  That wine will knock you  On your ass  Wow  I drank a lot of it  That night  And then  Every other night  Was pretty much just  You know  Beer or wine  Drinking 
[02:41:00]  Having fun  But not really doing it  I really didn't do anything  I hung out at the house  I played  Call of Duty 5  Nice  I was watching  A lot of TV  A lot of bad movies  Things like that  And then  Yesterday  My mother and Sal  Say  Why don't you come over  Dawn and Joseph  Are coming over  With the kids  And that's where  We'll leave this  Oh  Well  You had a little problem  Getting back to your house 
[02:41:30]  Last night  No  Getting 2  My mother and Sal  Oh 2  Whoop  Whoop  Whoop  Yeah  You know  You do the Sunday  Sunday afternoon thing  Go over there  And  What car did you take out  Kids  I took the Escalade  Nice  Because  You know  With the weather  The way it is  And the salt on the roads  And stuff  I don't want to  Take the Mustang out  So I took the Escalade  Which isn't known as  You know  A race car  Right  And I usually don't  I drive over the speed limit  With it  But not 
[02:42:00]  Not like I do  With the Mustang  So I'm getting on  To the expressway  I have a very long  On ramp  By my house  To get on the expressway  Which I like  Because I  I'm of the school of thought  That if you're getting on  A major highway  Use the on ramp  To get up to highway speed  Whenever I see somebody  At the end of an on ramp  With their blinker on 
[02:42:30]  And their head  Hanging out the window  With their elbow  Looking over their shoulder  Like  How did you fail  Right  How did you fail  The entire length  Of the on ramp  To figure this out  To fit in  To traffic  Right  It amazes me  And when I pass that car  I always look and go  Up  It figures  Because it's always  One of them  And you know  What I'm talking about  Uh huh  Yeah  So uh  I give her the gun  Give it the gas 
[02:43:00]  You know  Wham  Working the escalate  Up to highway speed  And I notice  The back end  Of a police car  It's not  A Nassau County cop car  It's not a sheriff's car  But it is a  Police car  So  I see him  He's in front of me  I'm on the on ramp  I see he's on the expressway  I'm on the on ramp  I'm coming on  I get on  I move into the middle lane  And I'm holding my speed  Which is 
[02:43:30]  Over the speed limit  But not crazy  And I pass him  I pass the officer  This is a  Local town cop  Who I think  Has jurisdiction  Over about  A mile  Of the expressway  Oh my god  You got  Yeah yeah  It was a local  Town cop  But he does have  Expressway jurisdiction  Between like  One exit  Oh my god  So um  I didn't have anything  Better to do  Dude well  So he's  He gets right on my ass 
[02:44:00]  And now I'm like  In that position  Where you go  Is he  Is he  Is he gonna do this  If you're gonna  Just do it already  You know  So uh  It took a little while  But he hits me  With the lights  I pull  Pull right over  Uh  It's the expressway  So I pull over  On the off ramp  And um  Very close to the side  I give him plenty of room  Always give the guy  Plenty of room  Some people pull over  In the expressway  And leave the cop  Hanging out in traffic  Just amazes me  Now the guy's pissed 
[02:44:30]  You know  So I gave him  Plenty of room  He um  Comes out  And he  Just asked me  For my paperwork  Doesn't tell me  What I did or anything  Cause I was  At this point  Like  Questioning  I was like  I didn't do anything  He didn't get me  On radar  He  I wasn't going  Fast enough  Long enough  For him to  Tail me  And get my speed  Uh  And I  I had slowed down  When he pulled up  Behind me  I had slowed down  To highway speed 
[02:45:00]  Which is why  He got right on my  My ass like that again  So it was a mystery  To me  I'm like  You know  Usually when this happens  I'm sure  I know why I'm being  Bulled over  I'm doing 95  On radar  So uh  He comes back  And he goes  What are you doing  I go  I was getting on  The uh  The on ramp  And I go  You know  You got one of those  Choices to make  You either speed up  To get past the car  Or you slow down  To get behind him  So I sped up  Uh  And I ended up  In front of you  And then I slowed down 
[02:45:30]  At highway speed  He goes  You passed me  Doing about 70  70 something  And I was like  I knew I didn't  I was in the 60s  Somewhere  But I didn't  Know I get the point  And then he said  When you were behind me  I go  Look  I'll tell you  I'll be honest with you  I said  A lot of people  When there's a cop  Behind them  Have no clue  What to do  Do you slow down  To the speed limit  Do you speed up  A little over the speed limit  Do you get out of the way  He goes  Well I'll tell you  One thing you don't do  You don't zip into  Another lane  And pass me  Oh snap 
[02:46:00]  Yeah  Yeah that was kind of  A jab  Like what I did  Um  So uh  He was giving you  The business  He was  And then he goes  He goes  I pulled you over  Before doing the same thing  Of course he did  And I  I go  I'm like Jesse James  On the expressway  I can't drive on this road  I'm gonna have to start  Taking the parkway  And take my chances  With the Stadies  So um  He remembered you  He remembered me  He goes  He goes  You were in  A red Ferrari  Oh my god  And you were in 
[02:46:30]  A different car  And then he goes  He goes  You're gonna tell me  It was the same thing  With the on-wrap  I go  I said no  That was crazy  I like agreed with him  I said no  That was crazy  It was the Ferrari  And everything  So uh  He hands me my stuff back  And he goes  I'm not gonna write you up  Cause I just know  Your little cronies  Are gonna get you  Out of it anyway  Cronies  And he  Called them cronies  Threw my stuff  In my lap  And uh 
[02:47:00]  Walked away  I know  I know your little  Cronies  Are gonna get you  Out of it  Well it's like  You always say man  Like they don't dare  Give you a ticket  They know better  Oh no  No I never said that  No you were saying  That in the office  No I  And I was very courteous  You were calling a chump  No I said  Thank you sir  Thank you officer  That's not what we heard  Right Jimmy  I said have a happy  New year officer  Thanks  Nope  I smiled  I was very courteous  Because I'm always courteous  To the police  I know I'm doing wrong  When I do wrong  This one was a little

[02:50:30]  Went off  It was a whole different story  Bing liked to tip back a few  And smack people around  Old brick liver  He had that great song  Ham through the window  How about the Bing Crosby  Little drummer boy  That he did with David Bowie  That's pretty good though  Oh it sucks  So fucking bad  Why don't you like it  They used to play that one  And I remember seeing it on TV  Yeah  And David Bowie  Was in his total glam  Glitter rock phase 
[02:51:00]  And here's old fucking Bing  With his pipe  And they looked  They looked ridiculous together  The best part is  Oh come on in  Yeah yeah  Like  Well  Look who's come  It's  Bowie  Yeah  David Bowie is coming in  Let's sing a song  And he's got his pipe  And David Bowie's hair is spiked  Looks like if that was his son  He'd fucking disown him  And kill him  Yeah he would have punched him 
[02:51:30]  Look we've got  Homosexuals coming in  To sing Little Drummer  B-b-boy  They made David Bowie go conservative  He has a little blazer on  He doesn't have his hair up  No it's not spiky  I remember it being spiky  He's got kind of the  Mullety thing going on  A little bit  Well why don't we sing  A little song here  Why don't you come in  Have a drink  Right  You have one of my drinks  And let me have some  Of your cocaine  A newborn king 
[02:52:00]  To see  A rum-pa-pum-pum  Hey  Nice to meet you  Our finest gifts  Well when I smack the kids around  I like listening to your music  Rum-pa-pum-pum  That's the sound the wife makes  When she's going down the steps  Oh Bing was a naughty boy  He sure was  Oh boy  Hey what was the dumb little banter  They had before the song  Yeah that's what we want  You have that  We want the stupid banter 
[02:52:30]  He said  Are you really a drunk  And he said  No are you really a faggot  And then the music started  He vomited gum  In Bing's face  Bing thought it was whiskey  So he drank it  Then they rolled around  Sucking each other's dicks  Humming rum-pum-pum-pum  That was the director's cut  He was holding David Bowie's balls  Like that pipe  As he sucked on the head of his cock  E-Rock just panked and said  But it's two minutes 
[02:53:00]  Well what else are we going to do  Let's play the dumb banter  Play the banter  Because it's  You Butler  It's been a long time  Since I've been the new anything  What's that into Hanson  I guess he's changing  Yeah he does that a lot doesn't he  You're not getting the hello  Yeah get back to the hello  I've got to get right  When he opens the fucking door  He looks through that little hole  In the fucking rest area bathroom  And he goes  Hello  I know you  And they have to both cover  For the fact that  They're fucking  They're fucking  Mule juice drinking Moe's  So they pretend

[02:56:00]  Peter Pumper  Yeah  English faggot  David Bowie goes over  To fuck the guy's  Mouth ears and ass  A lot  And then he sees this  Fucking old man  With perfect hair  And a fucking  Child's tooth in his knuckle  And he says  And he goes  Oh shit  I gotta change my story  He goes  I need a cover  He goes  I come over here  To play the piano  Right  And Bing says  We don't have a piano  You British fruit  So why don't you  Come on in  And go suck Mick Jagger's cock  Yeah why don't you  Come on in  And toot on this  For a little while 
[02:56:30]  And then he smears  Carrot cake on his bag  To entice Bowie  And David Bowie  Checks the right side  Of his colon  Whose Blackberry's  Going off  I keep checking mine  Now at least I know  What's going on  Alright let's  Yeah I'll clarify  Let's continue with this  Oh you're not the  Poor relation  From America  Gee  News sure travels fast  Doesn't it  I'm Bing  Oh I'm pleased to meet you  You're the one that sings  Right  Well right or wrong

[02:57:30]  Holiday thing  Do you win for any  Of the traditional things  In the  Bowie household  Christmas town  Oh yeah most of them  Really yeah  Excuse me  Can we pause this for a second  Yeah there's a lot of  Problems here  Holy shit  He just said  The Bowie household  Did he say hi  I'm David Bowie  Or I'm David  David Bowie  The Bowie household  Did he say I'm David Bowie  Or I'm just David  Okay he did  David Bowie  The Bowie household  Bowie is what  Everyone's doing  Watching this  Ah Bowie 
[02:58:00]  And Bing does boozy  And he goes  Hey Bing  Is it hard to get  Presence under the tree  When the tree is laying  On it's side  Because you've drunkenly  Grabbed your wife  By the clit  And thrown her into it  Ah shit  David yeah  You ever side kick  Your children  When they're running up 
[02:58:30]  For a hug  It just feels right  Wow  What year was this made  That John Lennon's  One of like the older guys  No see that was the joke  That boys don't  I understand  See I go way back  Like you know  Four years  Five years  Because David Bowie  Was like what  Completely new  At this point  Nah it's probably  Let's do a little guess here  I'm going to go with  1972  New  No it was really tasteless  It was 1980  Right after Lennon got shot  Straight through  A Lennon jab in there  Oh shit  Before Lennon  Alright I'm going to go 
[02:59:00]  19  I'm going to guess 76  But that's just me  No no  It's pushing 80  No  Bing Crosby died  1978  Did he really  No  It's like fuck  You got me  What year  Alright I'll say 74  74  Yeah  I guess  I'm pushing 80  I'm even  They can't do it  When was Lennon shot  1980  This is so fucking old  You know what  I'm going to go 82 
[02:59:30]  Wow you're crazy  Enough time went by  With the Lennon thing  Dude you're crazy  I guess  This is so 70  I said 76  Ant said 74  Oh apparently  It's up to 97  At this point  Can I change my guess  Yes  79  77  I'm telling you  I'm thinking this pushes 80  It's 77  77  Yeah I just saw it up  On the album  Where  Motherfucker  Who wins  Right down there  Who wins 
[03:00:00]  I do  I said 76  Yeah we're doing  Prizes right rules  I won  We all know I won  No you lose  No I won over  I hope you won over  No I didn't  Let's get back to these two douchebags  I can't take this audio  It's killing me  In fact I've got a six year old son  And he really gets excited  You ever punch him in the mouth  You win for any of the traditional things  In the boy household  Christmas town  Oh yeah most of them really  Presents 
[03:00:30]  Tree  Decorations  Wow  Agents sliding down the chimney  All the basics  I was just seeing if you're paying attention  Actually  Our family do  Most of the things that other families do  We sing the same song  Do you  I even have a go at Christmas  You too huh  Ah this one  This is my son's favorite  Do you know this one  Oh I do indeed  It's a lovely thing  Oh god  There we go  We don't have to hear the song right 
[03:01:00]  Yes we do  Alright there's a little controversy  Yuck  Controversy what  Crosby died in 1977  He died in October of 1977  Well  Maybe he shot himself  After he saw the final cut  No way  So now we have to  Alright the album came out in 77  But if it's a Christmas album  That would come out  Post  Post 
[03:01:30]  Post  You  Poss  Poss  Poss  Poss  Possibly  So  I want to know when they actually did this  Now you gotta start thinking 1976  Which would mean Jimmy is the big winner  This was recorded on September 11th 1977  And it says Crosby would die just over a month after recording this special  Wow  Well let me tell you  I'm gonna be dropping dead soon  Yeah  Holy shit  A month after we just saw that 
[03:02:00]  Now that's creepy to watch  Dead  I was guessing he died in 78  I was just kidding  And I was off by a year  Well you gave him an extra  An extra year  An extra year  Look at you  Generous  To a fault  What can I say  You rule  What did he die of  Ah  AIDS from shaking David Bowie's hand  David Bowie  Ah let's go with the guess  Ah I will say  Alcoholism  Um  You know something  Uh no  It wasn't the heart  He didn't look  It might be the heart 
[03:02:30]  Because uh  He didn't look like the big casino  Didn't he die on a golf course  I heard it was a tightrope accident  On a golf course  Whose fucking blackberry is that  I don't own a blackberry  I'll say  Brain  Hemorrhage  Oh that's a good one  I'm going  Damn is that good  Brain hemorrhage  Do you know though  No I don't  Alright  Swear  I'm gonna go  Uh  Liver failure  Um  I'm gonna go with a weird one 
[03:03:00]  He was  Um  Sorry  He was raped and eaten by a Komodo dragon  If Jimmy wins this  If Jimmy wins this  Ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haocc  Who has the answer  Travis has the answer  Alright here we go  Ah  I have stroke  Close Jim  Heart failure  Oh  Was it on a golf course?  Uh  No that was Caddyshack  Yeah 
[03:03:30]  He died in Spain  So I don't know  What was he doing?  I don't know. Let me find out.  Let me find out.  How are you going to find out what he was doing in Spain?  Wikipedia.  Oh.  It's a heart attack.  I'm going to go with the golf course thing.  The old Tigger. The old Tigger went out.  What do you think?  There was a blood clot from his knuckles.  Went into his heart.  He bashed that fucking wife of his. 
[03:04:00]  And there is the tombstone, so we've got to be around his death news.  What do we got?  That's his tombstone.  Wonderful.  He was only 73.  77.  You're right.  Golf course?  He went there to play golf.  It says he headed for Spain to play golf and die.  And die, yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Was he on the golf course when he died?  He's golfing.  After his last putt, Bing bowed to applause and said it was a great game.  He was about 20 yards from the clubhouse when he collapsed from a massive heart attack.  Wow.  Wow.  Great game.  Wow.  Can you put that back, Travis?  His son said that to endure the pain of the beatings, he would dream up ways to kill his father.  The kid's brother, Lindsey, supported the charges in the book.  The charges in the book.  Wow.  Uh.  Wow.  Jesus.  I should read that book. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  That would be a good read.  I know we were all looking for the Spain joke and Tim H. from Columbus.  He was running with the bulls in Spain and was gored in the ass.  That's right.  Which reminded him of his bully experience.  He liked it, yeah.  He liked it, yeah.  This is the worst of all the deadly serious XM.  I thought of you guys at my parents' house for Christmas.  Thanks, Peter.  The very Brady Christmas was on from 88.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And it was just, it was so funny because Peter and Bobby were sharing the living room  and Peter had on a nightshirt. 
[03:05:30]  And I'm like, who wears, whoever in this, at least from like after 1850 has worn a nightshirt.  A nightshirt.  Can't look at Robert Reed, do anything without noticing how gay he is now.  The hand on the hip.  Very gay.  The left hand being this while the right arm is akimbo on the hip.  You cannot notice.  Peter!  Peter!  Why don't you slip this sexy little nightshirt on, Peter? 
[03:06:00]  Because it's no fun unless I can pull something up in the back.  That's why all the Brady boys wear the nightshirts.  Nightshirts.  He just gave up acting straight.  Because I think in the original series, you can, I don't think you can tell at all, but  you're right.  These later episodes and specials that came out, he just said, ask her.  Oh, those scenes where-  I am what I am and here it is.  Those scenes where he's laying in bed with Carol at the end of the show, doing the  little show closer and they have to make like they're a loving married couple.  It's like, oh my, oh, Carol, come here, let me give you a kiss, I guess. 
[03:06:30]  I can smell that vagina from up here.  Ugh.  Eww!  Mind if I sleep in the boys' room tonight, Carol?  Greg, do you think I could shove that big horse sculptor at the bottom of the stairs on my ass? 
[03:07:00]  Let's try.  There's one scene where one of the Brady kids, like one of their kids, like whether  it was Marsh's little eight-year-old redheaded son, slid down the banister and Robert Reed  was at the bottom of the catch-up.  I'll catch you, come on down.  Oh, he's coming so fast.  And so am I.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I love those boys.  Ugh.  Stupid.  Girls, you okay?  Alright, good night.  Hi, boys! 
[03:07:30]  Let me tuck in and read you a little story.  Once upon a time, there was a homosexual actor playing a dad.  Well, I understand that he would molest Bobby and Greg, but he wouldn't molest Peter because  Peter wasn't mechanically inclined.  Peter, why don't you put on the Phil Packer mustache you wore in episode 33?  And, uh, you know, tickle my little member down here with that mustache. 
[03:08:00]  Ooh.  Alright, boys, we're gonna play Steal the Playbook.  I put it in my pants.  Now you boys gotta steal it so Greg can read the plays and...  Ooh.  I've rolled up these plans and put them in this tube.  Now you've gotta hide them in me.  Yeah, the other old guy with children all over his lap will be right back.  With more unforgettable holiday-themed Opie and Anthony moments. 
[03:08:30]  See, I hear this and I start to feel it in my undershirts.  And Uncle Paul Christmas will continue next.  We're celebrating the season with classic holiday moments from the Opie and Anthony archives.  Here to bring you more is Uncle Paul.  Welcome back to the Uncle Paul Christmas special.  You gotta be a good boy or a girl.  You're gonna get cold in your stock.  Why don't you sit on Santa's lap?  Move back and forth a little bit. 
[03:09:00]  You play the little vroom vroom game.  Where your butt cheeks go over the speed bump.  Yay!  Back and forth on the lap.  Whoops-a-daisy, we're on the speed bump.  We better put a little baby earl on the speed bump.  So that we slide over it better.  Quick, put some baby earl on the speed bump.  Go back and forth over the lap.  In this segment, we was talking about parents who've ruined Christmas for their kids and they're scarred for life. 
[03:09:30]  You gotta be good to your kids on Christmas.  You gotta wake them up with a tummy kiss.  Maybe you suck their toes a little to wake them up.  Tickle them.  They're dreaming about sugar plums and they wake up.  Yeah, you suck the toes and they laugh.  Have some Christmas cookies.  And they also talk about how you can't buy new technology as gifts for old people.  I don't like old people. 
[03:10:00]  I'm 57 years young.  I'll be 58 in March.  I like to get a nice present.  Maybe a picture scrapbook or something for my friend with his young sons in Taiwan.  You know, just some pictures of something to look at.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  A girl once remained nameless.  Whose father walked out on the family on Christmas Day. 
[03:10:30]  On Christmas Day!  That little tidbit of baggage will stick with a girl for a while.  Makes Christmas a fucking treat for year after year.  I'll give you that one.  Hey, here's a present.  Yeah, my daddy left on Christmas!  Fucking Christmas!  Here it is again.  Merry Christmas!  I think I know who you're talking about.  Oh my God!  Oh no.  I gotta go...  I don't know.  It's Christmas Day. 
[03:11:00]  Do you know how this screws up Christmas?  Let's go take a leak, Jimmy.  Do you know if a father has to be that goddamn selfish, he can't wait till the 26th?  You can't wait a day?  He's gotta screw up Christmas.  And you know, fine.  Screw up your own family.  Do you realize you're screwing it up for every guy that's trying to make a relationship with  your daughter?  Because every Christmas, you, especially the first one, takes you by complete surprise.  Everything's fine and dandy.  That's hilarious.  You're thinking, oh, man, this is a special day.  I just started dating this girl. 
[03:11:30]  It's our first Christmas together.  First Christmas together.  I got a nice stack of presents for her.  Aww!  I've been listening to Christmas carols in my car all the way over to her house.  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.  Honey!  Honey!  Right.  Mary!  What?!  Why are you crying?  It's Christmas!  Christmas is jolly and fun!  What's the matter?  I got to tell you something. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, fuck!  More baggage I hadn't figured out.  You know, usually a guy can figure some of the baggage out.  That's hilarious.  You can't see that one coming.  It's so true.  You can't see that one coming until the 25th,  until old St. Nick is supposed to be wiggling his fat ass down the goddamn chimney.  That's when you figure that one out.  My father left on Christmas.  Thank you, Pop.  Job well done.  At that point, you should have just taken all our presents and thrown them in the fire.  Exactly.  It would have been a happier moment. 
[03:12:30]  He did.  He left on Christmas.  Goodbye.  I'm going.  Well, that's what you should have said.  And you know what?  I'm taking his lead.  I'm off.  Well, you did do that, but I think 10 years later, right?  It wasn't Christmas.  Oh, you should have waited until Christmas, though.  You really should have waited until Christmas.  You should have had that vicious intuition and waited until Christmas.  Oh, my God.  And say, I now understand why he left you.  That would have been a bad one.  And slammed the door. 
[03:13:00]  That's just not that mean.  I'm leaving.  It just really isn't that mean when it comes down to it.  Anthony is a very nice guy.  Dressed in a Santa cap.  That is funny, though.  Feeding away from the house.  That whole baggage thing, when you get into a relationship, you have no idea.  You think you got it all figured out until a holiday comes or Father's Day, in my case.  You think you got it figured out.  Jesus.  Father's Day, in my case, was the big one.  Why was that a big one?  Door slamming and crying all day.  I'm like, what the hell happened here?  Isn't that great?  Aren't the dates of what things happened just tragic? 
[03:13:30]  Jeez.  They come out of nowhere.  Oh, the Christmas.  I got the visual, though.  You got the gifts all piled up nice.  Probably wrote out a nice card.  Knowing you, you might even have had a Santa hat on because it was your first Christmas.  Really just giving it your best.  Giving it my all, by gosh.  Yeah.  Dude, one of the worst cases of chick baggage I ever had came out of nowhere because this  wasn't on a specific date or anything.  One day, my girlfriend just burst into tears out of nowhere. 
[03:14:00]  And no, nothing, nothing.  Is this a girl that I don't know?  Yeah, this is one you don't know from years ago.  All right.  It's like, what happened?  What's the matter?  Blah, blah, blah.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Jesus Christ, what's wrong?  So, every year around this time of day, she started getting a little weird.  And I never knew what the hell it was.  Find out she, her mother was an alcoholic.  Always drunk.  She was leaving for school one day. 
[03:14:30]  And she says goodbye to her mom every day.  And her mother's always like drunk, passed out or something like that.  So, one day, she's passed out on the kitchen floor.  And she says goodbye to her and goes to school.  She comes back.  Her mother's dead on the floor.  She had slipped and cracked her head on the counter.  And when she said goodbye to her in the morning, she was already like, she had already hit her head.  So, maybe if, you know, I'm sure she went through years of thinking, if I only call up a hospital, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:15:00]  She left her there on the floor because she had always been passed out.  So, when did, did you try to help this bad, bad girl?  I know.  I said, geez, miss, not paying any attention to anything.  Yeah, I tried to help her.  No, you don't help.  It's just baggage.  So, that was obviously the anniversary of the death, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  The anniversary of that every year.  Jesus.  And you'd see it coming from weeks away.  And you're like, oh, it's that day. 
[03:15:30]  You see it bubbling under the surface.  Oh, it's mom clocked her head on the edge of the counter day.  Spend the whole day waxing the kitchen floor.  Oh, my God.  You know, there's no Hallmark card to get her for that occasion.  So, your mom whacked her head on the counter.  Sorry to hear.  Whoops-a-daisy.  Whoops-a-daisy.  Whoops.  Whoosh.  Crash.  A little cartoon.  Bringing up some memories really fast on the phones. 
[03:16:00]  And then we'll go back to Nathaniel's commentary.  Yeah, I don't want to shut him out.  It's his day.  Bill on Long Island.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Bill.  What's up?  Oh, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Christmas.  I was like four years old.  And everything's going great.  And then, for some reason, my grandpa locks himself in the basement.  And my dad drives away.  And I don't see him.  It's Christmas Eve.  And I'm a little four-year-old.  I'm like, where's Daddy gone?  And apparently, it was a huge fight.  And Daddy didn't come back for a few days. 
[03:16:30]  And then next year, the exact same thing happened again.  Every year.  Yeah, the worst.  And no one ever told me why.  That story's kind of sad, but Tennessee always beats out any sad story.  Let's go to Jim in Tennessee.  Listen to this one.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey.  Tell your cute story.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's a funny story.  We should have Christmas songs playing.  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  We need a nice Christmas song.  Wait a minute. 
[03:17:00]  If we're going to do this bit, we've got to get some Christmas music.  There we go.  All right, Jim.  Tell your cute little Christmas story.  Tell your cute little Christmas story.  Okay, my father, his birthday is on Christmas.  He gets plastered.  He's in the Air Force.  He's a Chief Master Sergeant.  He comes home.  My sister's pouring his whiskey out down the sink so he doesn't get any more plastered.  He takes the bottle and commences to busting her over the head with it. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, 16 stitches.  And, you know, he was a Chief Master Sergeant.  Nobody was going to cough.  Of course.  Nobody was going to, you know, take him to jail.  Boy, that must have been a Merry Christmas.  Yeah, Merry Christmas.  That must have been a fun, memorable Christmas for the kids.  I have a worst Christmas story.  I don't want to tell you.  I never told it on the air.  Oh, come on, Jimmy. 
[03:18:00]  I just remember one year my friend was married and he didn't want to be married.  He took a little boat ride.  Oh, God.  Why does it always have to go back to the little Connor Peterson?  Why, why, why?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  All right, we have another one, Anthony.  Dave in Queens.  Dave, go ahead. 
[03:18:30]  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Hi.  Hey, a little nervous, guys.  Hi, boo-boo.  Hi, Frida.  Love you, Frida.  Can you hear me?  Yes, Frida.  I was married for about two years and I was, you know, the sex was always a little weird  with my ex-wife or my wife at the time.  And she told me, can you hear me, guys?  Yep.  Yeah, Frida.  She told me that her father got her pregnant when she was 12.  Oh, Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Make a long story short, it didn't work out well after that. 
[03:19:00]  Dude, if I heard that story, my girlfriend would wonder why every Christmas I had a throbbing  heart on.  Well, you know what?  In actuality, I started one time, I was joking around saying, who's your daddy?  She just made a straight face and she said, don't say that.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I didn't take anything of it.  And then, you know, sex got weirder and weirder.  And after that, it all went down south.  Ah, what a curmudgeon she was.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  What selfish parents, man.  George and Jersey.  What's up, George?  What's up, George?  I'm a selfish girl.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This is a true story. 
[03:19:30]  We're planning a big family Christmas.  Everybody's coming in from around the country.  My 60-year-old grandparents are coming up from Florida.  Three days before Christmas, my father calls me up and says, I'm going to divorce your mother,  but I'm going to tell her after Christmas.  Right.  And now we're all sitting there.  Everybody comes in.  The brothers, my brothers are sitting around the Christmas table just waiting for that special moment  where Dad's going to say, by the way, I believe in your mother. 
[03:20:00]  It was miserable.  It ruined Christmas.  It was horrible.  They're all geared up for the big, I'm getting a divorce from your mom story.  But here's the worst part.  The worst part is, Dad goes to see a divorce attorney, finds out he's going to lose 20% of  everything that he owns, that's out of it, and now we're stuck with my family for Christmas  for the rest of my fucking life.  Yeah, see, it would have cost him too much so he didn't get a divorce.  There you go.  At least they're together for the right reasons.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Merry Christmas. 
[03:20:30]  Earl in Alabama.  What's up, Earl?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just, I'm a truck driver and I was coming home for Thanksgiving last year, 2003.  Thanksgiving, Christmas, holidays.  Close enough.  Sure.  Well, hang on, it all goes over the whole holiday season.  All right, let's go.  I found out on my way home that my wife was banging a prison inmate.  We ended up signing divorce papers.  We ended up signing divorce papers the day before Thanksgiving.  I got to come back down there on Christmas Day because, you know, we've got a five-year-old 
[03:21:00]  daughter.  So to see my daughter, I had to go in there and see this guy living in my house with my  Christmas tree and everything, you know, with all my stuff.  That ruined Christmas Day.  And then to rule New Year's Eve, that was our anniversary.  Oh, man.  There you have it.  There you have it.  His wife was banging an inmate.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  I got it from a Negro.  I thought I heard Negro. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, banging inmates.  You can whip me all you like, white devil, but you'll never break my spirit.  I don't know where my other clips are.  I know.  I see that.  Aaron and Callie.  What's up, Aaron?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  I just got a pretty messed up Christmas story.  I was going out with my girlfriend for a few years, and I was probably 19 at the time.  Well, we had some problems and broke up for a while, and she decided she wanted to get 
[03:22:00]  back together.  But at the time, I had already got another girlfriend, and we were living together.  Well, so my parents thought it would be a good idea to bring my old girlfriend to my  work while I was living with a new one and try and get me back together with her.  And, well, basically, I was kind of pissed off, so I go home and tell the girl I'm living  with, well, hey, my parents, they brought my old girlfriend over, and they wanted me  to get back together.  And, of course, my girlfriend's reaction is to get pissed at me and basically want to  break up.  So I'm thinking, well, you know, maybe I should get back together with my old girlfriend, 
[03:22:30]  you know, because she was pretty hot or whatever.  And so, anyway, I called her up, and we made plans to go over to her house on Christmas  Day, oh, I did, and I got back together with the girl I was living with, and she was crying  and sniveling and whining.  And, well, basically, I felt kind of bad, so I was like, well, no, I called my old girlfriend  up on Christmas morning and said, sorry, I'm not coming back together, it's over.  And, basically, all I heard was this click.  And after listening to you guys, I'm thinking she's going to have some emotional trauma for 
[03:23:00]  long periods of time.  So, punch it out.  Thank God.  Too late.  I know.  Just in time.  Everyone else punched out.  You were the last one to punch out.  Yeah, I didn't like it to anyone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the guy that has to turn off the lights.  He's the last person listening to the show today.  Flip the lights anyway out.  Lock up.  Lock up, please, because everyone else left.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I was about nine years old. 
[03:23:30]  Me and my sister had a paper route.  And my father was, you know, mechanically quite, if he wanted the grass, he would set  the house on fire.  So, Christmas Eve, he comes home all drunk.  He falls into the bushes.  And, you know, him and my mom have a fight and my sister go to bed.  I wake up like three o'clock in the morning and I hear something in the living room.  So, I go downstairs and I see my father, what I thought was, taking apart these bicycles  that he was actually trying to put them together.  So, I got all pissed off and, you know, that he was taking apart the bikes that Santa left  us. 
[03:24:00]  So, I start, like, throwing the presents at him.  My mother wakes up.  She's screaming.  It was just a friggin' debacle.  So, your drunk dad was ruining your presents.  No, I thought he was.  He thought so.  He thought he was, but he wasn't.  But he still kind of beat up his father a little bit there.  Yeah, he was trying to put them together and I didn't put that together.  All right.  Nothing worse than the father-son brawl.  Never had one of those.  My father would have killed me.  But those things are just the most awful things ever.  When the son is beating up the father. 
[03:24:30]  I almost had one.  I picked up a stick out of the garage and my father's like, come on, let's go in the  backyard.  Get out.  I'm like, nah.  You gave up right there, nah.  What were you picking up a stick for, you ass?  I was drunk.  I was drunk.  You were drunk.  Yeah, he didn't mind the stick at all.  He was ready to take it and smash me with it.  You should shove it up your ass.  So I felt, even in my drunkenness, I felt it would be prudent to replace the stick and  end the quarrel.  You're quite a willfy young boy, Jimmy Norton. 
[03:25:00]  All right, let's go.  Naughty.  Let's try one more.  James in Arizona.  What's up, James?  None much, just listen and love it.  All right.  Santa baby.  My story is that I come back from being deployed in the army.  Yeah.  My wife was pregnant.  It wasn't mine.  I've been deployed for 13 months.  She's seven months pregnant.  We got a divorce right before Christmas.  It was finalized on Valentine's Day exact.  Wow.  There you go.  I found that to be perfect.  What a great Christmas.  You wrecked two holidays for her. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, that was just fucking magnificent.  No, she wrecked them for him.  Yeah, that's true.  Did she try to explain the pregnancy?  Uh, yes.  She said that she slipped and fell on someone else's dick.  Slipped and fell on someone else's dick.  Uh, Mark.  Yeah, hello?  We want to end up on an up note.  Help us out.  Yeah, my girlfriend kicked me out last year Christmas.  She boxed up all my shit and put a bow on it and left it at my apartment. 
[03:26:00]  Nice one.  That's a clever girl.  And kind of funny and silly at the same time.  Oh, we got one more.  Yes, one more.  Scott in Texas.  Yes, Scott?  Yeah, when I was a kid, the little kid next door, Jimmy Norton, he forced me to play Monster  Snow under the porch on Christmas Day.  Monster Snow.  God, we know what Monster Rain is.  What is Monster Snow?  It's when you put on snow pants.  It makes it that much more difficult to do.  Yeah, because you're both shivering. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, oh, uh, brr, brr.  This is the worst of the Bobby and Anthony show on Sirius XM.  Uh, how was your Christmas there, Anthony?  Oh, wonderful.  Were you done with your Christmas, Jimmy?  Nothing?  I didn't open one present.  I didn't see one person except until I went to the pet dinner.  You didn't go see your family or anything like that?  Nah, I talked to them.  I, uh, I'm going to see them.  I'm going to bring them out to LA.  And you had no gift to open up?  None.  Are you kidding?  No.  That's okay.  It's my own design.  I didn't buy any either.  Oh, you didn't get any by any?  I'm going to buy some today, my family. 
[03:27:00]  I went the, uh, the, uh, American Express gift card route, whatever you want to say.  And I'm noticing, uh, or I, I did notice anyway, a lot of gift cards this year by the  entire family.  Like Christmas Eve, my family does, uh, Christmas Eve.  Well, the news did a report.  They said gift cards were just massive this year.  And people have reached the point where it's convenient.  Um, it's not like, uh, the old gift certificate to some cheesy place.  You could get American Express gift cards or other gift cards that are good in multiple 
[03:27:30]  places.  You go, you use it like a credit card.  It looks like a credit card.  You go there, you use it like a credit card and it's however much money you have on it.  Where do you get them?  AmericanExpress.com is where I got mine.  And, uh, yeah, they get delivered to your house.  You throw them in some cards, uh, and hand them out.  And that's what I did.  The most work I did was, um, on Photoshop.  I, uh, made something that I could print on the envelopes with everyone's name, with a 
[03:28:00]  little shadowing and some nice festive colors and stuff and printed out a bunch of envelopes.  Why the look of disgust, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I was in the Christmas spirit.  Sounds like it.  And, uh, that's, that's what I gave out.  Next year, I'm just going to do some wheeling and dealing.  You're going to give me a gift card.  I'm going to give you a gift card.  Are we, we swear?  We're good?  We're good.  Okay.  Let's not worry about each other.  How about me and you?  Me and you?  You're going to give me a gift card?  I'm going to, okay.  We're done, right?  That's it.  That's it.  Done, right? 
[03:28:30]  And then all I have to do is buy a gift for my mom and I'm, I'm, I'm good to go.  Then we had a big controversy over my mom's gift because my mother, for some reason, does  not want to leave, uh, the 1800s.  Because the digital to her is some evil thing.  I, I talk to her all the time about things like the internet movie database, imdb.com.  You go there if you want to find out anything about movies.  My mother, one of the biggest movie buffs ever, loves going to the movies, loves, uh, 
[03:29:00]  old movies, new movies, just loves it.  And I tell her about IMDb because there's constantly times where you go, who the fuck  was the actor that was in that movie?  IMDb, you got the answer in a second.  She insists, and every year she gets it, the big, thick, Leonard Maltin book of movies.  Like you're going through this big encyclopedia of movies to find answers and trying to cross  reference things. 
[03:29:30]  I mean, you could just pop it on because she will not get a computer.  We have tried getting her a computer.  Maybe she reads it on the bowl.  Uh, well, you know, a laptop fits there, uh, in the bathroom.  Let me tell you, I don't think she reads it on the bowl and I don't want that image conjured  up either.  I'm only saying, play devil's advocate.  Why would you want a big book?  Sometimes I spend hours on the bowl.  I like a big, thick book to peruse.  A lot of people may do that.  That's not out of the realm.  I could read my phone on the book.  It's very handy.  I could read my phone on the bowl, on the book, at a flub market. 
[03:30:00]  No, no, no.  I just, I wasn't sure what you meant.  You mean you should read your phone?  All right.  Yeah.  There's plenty of things to read on the bowl.  And my mother isn't reading it on the bowl.  Was that...  No.  Did I?  Yeah.  I think it did.  I don't know.  I'm just talking about reading a phone.  No, he said reading his phone.  Yeah.  I know, but you don't mind.  I do read the phone.  Never mind.  You can read the phone these days.  That's what you do in this modern digital age that my mother is just not, she wants no part  of. 
[03:30:30]  So years ago, we tried to even get her that drive.  Remember when web TV was out?  Yeah.  It's like, look, it's on the TV.  Just so you can get a fucking email.  So we can send you a picture or something.  So it doesn't have to be, put a photo in the mail with a stamp and mail it to her.  She wants nothing to do with it.  Uh, they tried getting her a digital camera a couple of years ago that plugs right into  a docking station on, on the thing and photos come out.  No computer involved.  Now, I don't, Ooh, no, I, uh, no, no. 
[03:31:00]  So this year, uh, uh, they got her a digital camera.  She wants no part of it.  So I got, and I started a big controversy because, uh, me and my girlfriend got her a Canon 35  millimeter camera, got a regular film camera.  And now that started because we didn't, you know, to talk.  It's like, Oh, we got her a digital camera.  Now she's not even going to use the digital one because the big controversy on the gift  giving for a mom's camera. 
[03:31:30]  But that was about the biggest controversy aside from, uh, the present my brother gave  me, which, uh, probably one of the best Christmas presents.  Wait, wait, before you go there.  Yeah.  So which camera is she going to use?  So she looks at me and goes, I'm using the film camera.  Of course.  I'm using, I totally undermined their attempt to get her up to speed.  And really fast.  Cause I have a thought before you move on.  Yeah.  Who else try to buy their like parents, just a simple DVD player.  Nah.  And, and, and your folks cannot figure out how to use a DVD. 
[03:32:00]  Where does the tape go?  No, it's, it's not tape anymore.  It's, it's DVD.  And here's the, Oh, I don't, their arms go up.  Ooh, I, Ooh, Ooh, I, it is a nightmare.  You're trying to teach your parents, uh, how to, how to work a DVD player.  How do you rewind the DVD?  Because they can't comprehend the whole menu thing.  Yeah.  You know, they just want to be able to push play and the movie to start.  And, and that should be a feature on these damn things, but they're not.  My mom cannot get past the fucking menu and she can't, she can't grasp the concept that 
[03:32:30]  there's a menu and you got to move the fucking thing around to play the movie and what have  you.  How did they get to be where they are in life?  How did they get so old?  That part of their brain doesn't work.  It's bizarre.  I've sat down with my mom.  I'm, I'm talking about a DVD player.  I actually bought her a while ago and I'm still trying to teach her how to use it.  And I know I'm not alone in this.  The whole menu thing.  Just she, she just wants to throw the stupid movie in and push play and go.  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  And most players, you just cannot do that.  They still have VCRs videotape and she gets a, for, for her birthday or Christmas gets  DVDs and she'll open it up like, Oh, what's a, what's this?  It's a DVD.  Oh, the one of the, and like, Oh, one of those DVDs.  Like you're talking about, you just gave her some fucking, uh, a spacecraft.  They're scared.  That's why all the people don't want to use it.  They're afraid that it's not, that they can't comprehend it.  It's overwhelming. 
[03:33:30]  The digital life is so far from them that they are obsolete.  Yes.  Is that what it is?  Picture walking into a 60 year calculus class.  That's how they feel.  We're onto something with this, uh, parent thing though.  Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Gummy boobs.  Hi, Dennis.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, not Dennis.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't fucking insult me.  I can't get by it.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I just want to say, Dennis, go fuck yourself.  Anyway, going back to what you were talking about.  Yeah.  I find it amazing that my father can fly an airplane.  Yeah.  But he can't stop his VCR from flashing 12 o'clock. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, he flies an airplane, huh?  And he can't work the VCR features.  Right.  VCR.  I got him a DVD two years ago.  He must have called me five times.  How do I work this again?  I gave up.  I gave up.  My mom's no dummy, but she cannot grasp the whole DVD player with the menu and having  to hit play here and then pausing, and she just doesn't get it.  It's a fear of the overwhelming nature of the digital age.  That's all it is.  I didn't say that.  Dennis told me.  Ah.  Let's say hi to Dan in Chicago. 
[03:34:30]  It's got to be true.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  What's up, Dennis?  Hello.  I just did the ultimate, guys.  I got my parents a TiVo for Christmas.  Uh-oh.  And you feel good about yourself when you're buying these big gifts for your parents going,  oh, I finally got a gift they're really going to enjoy.  Yeah.  What happened there, Dan?  My mom is concerned that the neighbors are going to be upset when she hits pause.  Because she's going to somehow control network television.  That's a hot one.  So, you know, if you guys are watching, and in the middle of something, everything just pauses. 
[03:35:00]  It's my mom.  It's your mother.  Yeah.  They don't understand it.  Like the computer thing.  I wanted to tell my mother to get a computer.  We were going to get her a laptop.  Nice and easy.  It's not a big intimidating thing.  So she could get email.  She doesn't understand.  And then I don't call for a while, and she's like, oh, you know, you haven't called in a while.  Get a fucking computer.  I'll email.  You'll get pictures.  You can get video. 
[03:35:30]  All of a sudden, I'll email you a video.  Nothing.  Your mom could come on Pal Talk.  She could come on Pal Talk and look at luscious breasts if she wants to.  Nothing.  She wants no part of it.  She goes, I don't know.  I'm afraid I'll just get addicted to it and sit there all day.  No, you're not.  You're petrified of it.  Yeah.  And get your parents big gifts that they can't handle.  I got my mother a Yankee hat and my father a pocket pussy.  That's a nice gift to give your parents.  There you go. 
[03:36:00]  Cleaning instructions.  He doesn't use it.  He's an older gentleman.  He puts it in the car.  He holds change in it.  Jim?  It's Dad.  How do you clean this?  Could you come over and clean this thing for me?  Ugh.  Brad.  Morning, Big Dick Santa.  Hi.  Yeah, man.  Pretty much my mom, but my fucking total douche of a stepdad and iPod.  Now I'm stuck hooking the thing up for it together.  And secondly, I get a list of songs that I get to download for.  Ooh.  Oh, that's so nice of you.  Yeah, it is. 
[03:36:30]  But I'm pretty much just going to rig the little fucker with a bunch of suck my fucking cock and O&A jingles.  You sure?  My fucking dad.  Download gay porn clips and put his favorite song titles, so I'm going to put it on and just hear fucking one man saying, you know, whatever another man says in gay porn.  Whatever.  I almost stepped into a bear trap there.  Yes, you almost did.  Firing out quotes.  Love you, boy.  Funk out.  An iPod is very rough to get for somebody.  Yeah.  Like an older person that has no clue.  Yeah.  Because then they have to learn how to download songs for it, and it's just a catastrophe. 
[03:37:00]  My parents ask for weird stuff.  They do?  Yeah.  Like, my father asked for, like, the Harry Potter videos and some lubricant.  It's not that weird.  What a fucking Harry Potter.  The whole Harry Potter collection, some KY, that's it.  Well, he didn't know the name.  He just said, I want the movies with that Potter kid. 
[03:37:30]  Brimby film starring that Potter boy.  Uncle Paul is off explaining why the children's sheets smell like schnapps.  But he'll be right back with more holiday classics from the ONA archives.  More of an Uncle Paul Christmas coming up.  You're listening to classic holiday moments from the worst of the ONA archives.  Keep the kids away from the mistletoe.  Uncle Paul is back.  I remember when Anthony went down to the casino in Atlantic City.  Oh, he sure is a gambler. 
[03:38:00]  I like to play canasta with my friends.  Oh, we sit around and play for nickels and dimes.  It's all for fun.  We just smoke ciggies and trade pictures.  But Anthony's a real alcoholic and a compulsive gambler.  And, uh, he had his family over for Christmas and then he goes down to the casino and he don't even see nobody.  Oh, he just plays a bunch of blackjack.  Hey, more cards, less cards. 
[03:38:30]  What do I know?  And who's left out in the cold?  Oh, Paul Hargis.  I'm the one at the casino says,  Your girlfriend's too young, Paul.  You're not allowed to put that little extra seat on top of the gambling chair.  So we had to go upstairs and make love.  Right there in the car seat.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  On Sirius XM.  Anthony, what a week inside.  Let's get into this. 
[03:39:00]  What happened?  I spent a week.  Indoors.  And I didn't even realize until, um, until, uh, I got home from a little vacation and I stepped out of the vehicle and it was freezing fucking cold out.  We've had some cold weather here in New York.  So, so, um, well, I wasn't far.  I was in Atlantic City.  So, you know, I'm talking basically the same weather, a few degrees difference.  Did some of that gambling?  Yeah.  Did some of that gambling.  Bogata?  State of the board, Bogata.  They treat me like, like a king. 
[03:39:30]  Like a Godda.  I love it.  I was just going to go for a couple of days.  Because, uh, you know, the first week of vacation was spent with a lot of Christmas festivities and stuff.  And I do a whole big family thing.  Christmas Eve and then Christmas Day over the house.  Little rugrats now all over the goddamn place.  It's ridiculous.  And all I did, like, the next day was look around and go, this kid handprints everywhere!  You don't like your, you don't like your little nephew and niece? 
[03:40:00]  I love them.  They're adorable.  But they're at that age where they can smear shit, right?  I looked at, like, the bottom window in one of my rooms looked like that last scene in Blair Witch with the little handprints all over the place.  I'm like, what?  They got to touch everything?  And what, are they working a fry-a-lator?  What are the kids doing that their hands are the greasiest things I've ever friggin' seen leaf prints?  Enough!  Kids rule until they start moving around. 
[03:40:30]  I had kids over for my Christmas, too.  And at one point, they were taking turns just kicking my walls.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  That's a great time for a kid.  And jumping off a, uh, and most people know I don't really give a shit about fucking, like, nice things.  But I do have a nice leather chair.  Ah!  Not to them.  No.  It was a place to stand to jump from there to the windowsill. 
[03:41:00]  I, uh, yeah.  I can't.  And then I noticed...  How do you compete with a kid just kicking your wall?  Kicking your wall is ridiculous.  They don't understand.  Because I get freaked out just by their greasy little fingerprints.  I have a nice round, like, glass and wood table and stuff like that.  And around the entire perimeter was just like...  Because they hold on to it.  And then they go around and around and around.  And it was just smeared with...  But a little Windex and that's done.  Yeah, I understand. 
[03:41:30]  It's all the smear marks you can't see that you're never going to clean because you just don't see it.  But here was my dilemma.  I had shindigs for Christmas and the maids had already come over.  So once the Christmas thing was done, I'm stuck there, like, looking around going, I can't...  The fingerprints freak me out.  That's why you left for a week.  Now it's obvious.  I actually think I did...  Oh, wait.  I fled the house. 
[03:42:00]  You're right.  See, I'm kind of getting recollections of what happened.  I fled the house to the point where Ange, Keith's wife, takes care of my business and stuff like that, walked into a disaster.  I left everything just...  And then ran.  Food.  Food was left, like, laying out.  Food in the oven.  You're just like, fuck it.  Oven on the table, still, like, set.  I just ran.  Ran out of the house.  I forgot.  I, uh...  Before we get into your AC story, I had a kid. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Who doesn't like wearing clothes.  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  I know that, rascal.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  And had explosive diarrhea in my vestibule.  Oh, shit.  Okay, see, that would be...  But if the kid likes clothes, it's all contained.  But because the kid doesn't like clothes, you can only imagine what explosive diarrhea is like coming from a kid that's not wearing clothes. 
[03:43:00]  First of all, can I explain something to you?  Yes.  Who is letting their kid run around with no clothes on in somebody else's house?  Um, it's my brother's kid.  All right.  My brother...  I would say, hey, Joe, clothes.  Clothes on the kid.  I don't want naked baby-ass marks on my tables.  And this year, I had a no-shoes policy.  But one of the kids can't live without his shoes on.  No.  And the parents said, and let the kid have his shoes on. 
[03:43:30]  And he was one of the kids that decided he needed to kick my wall a lot.  Kick your wall with his shoes on.  That's why he needs the shoes.  What?  Oh, my God.  I didn't hear that.  That's why he needs the shoes, or else he'd break his little toesies.  He can't kick the walls without shoes on.  You ever kick a wall with no shoe?  It hurts.  Can I tell you another thing?  I'm sorry that I'm taking...  Because I do want to hear about AC, but you're bringing back all these memories.  But this year, I plan, because I have...  I do a little Christmas thing after Christmas for my family now. 
[03:44:00]  And there's about 10 under the age of 11.  10 kids under the age of 11 running around my house, which I haven't seen yet.  Still at.  In the new year, you should.  Oh, I know.  But it's a small place.  It's not like your big, huge fucking compound.  So I got the idea.  You know what?  I'm going to fucking power up that Wii.  I'm going to buy every fucking game known to kids.  They will be distracted, and I'll be fine this year.  A lot less stress. 
[03:44:30]  So they're starting to kick the walls and jump off the leather fucking chair and this and that.  I'm like, all right, it's time to fire up the Wii.  Yeah.  You know the fucking thing burnt out?  I couldn't turn on the fucking Wii.  Your Wii broke?  That was my go-to fucking solution.  No Wii.  So another two to three hours of walls being kicked and a full hockey game in my vestibule.  That's why you need no less than five gaming systems in your house at any given moment.  Dude, I had the PS3, but I don't think they wanted to play Tiger Woods. 
[03:45:00]  No.  That's the only game I have for my PS3.  Yeah.  Sorry, but back to it.  The kids over the house was just like, okay, all right, well, whatever.  What is that about?  It was a little rough.  It's a little rough.  A little rough.  They, you know.  A little rough.  I love them, but a little rough.  Yeah.  When they're standing on chairs that are more expensive than the houses they live in, it's  a little rough. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You just try to have nice things.  See, that's the thing.  It's like...  But they look at you like, hey, I'm like, yeah, but I'm lucky enough to have nice things.  That doesn't mean that we should just blow off the fact that I have nice things.  I count my blessings.  Of course.  That I have nice things.  That's all.  And then when animals or people ruin them, I get like, why bother?  Then I'll just go to Ikea.  One kid brought one of those Super Bowls that picks up all the dirt. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, that's Timothy.  I like to make him chase it with butter on him.  One kid brought a Super Bowl.  A ball that picks up all the dirt and decided he was bored that he needed to bounce some  off my wall.  Your wall was...  There was no less than 40 to 50 ball marks on this one wall.  You need a painter to come in now?  Yeah.  I can't scrub it off for whatever reason. 
[03:46:30]  How many kids were there?  About 10 or 11.  For how long?  For...  Six days.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  About six hours, probably.  That's fine.  And in one day, you can't...  Damn, that's right.  Marshmallow?  What?  Now, whose brilliant idea was that?  What's this?  I don't know.  That was Christmas Day?  What's this?  Everything's a...  My whole vacation's a blur, by the way.  Oh, by the way, Lydia's saying a lot of people do therapy in cycles, Jimmy. 
[03:47:00]  I don't care what she says.  It doesn't work in cycles.  It works for me.  It doesn't work.  It works.  No, it's progressive.  I saw some improvements.  What happens is when you do something...  And this is not you.  You is the collective you.  You do something in cycles.  There's X amount of progress.  And then all of a sudden, it stops.  And then it just kind of plateaus.  And then you just talk about the mistakes you made while plateauing instead of delving  further in.  Well, there was an understanding, though, with the lady I talked to.  She knew that it was time for me to just kind of, you know, walk in. 
[03:47:30]  Just walk away.  And take what I learned and then do something with it.  Yeah.  There was an understanding, actually.  She was like, yeah, you're good for now.  And she's an idiot.  And I don't...  Again, any therapist that would say you're good for now after less than a year of therapy  for anybody, isn't it?  She didn't officially say you're good for now.  It was just an understanding.  Like, yeah, you should go and...  She probably went, you should go and find another therapist.  And work the lessons that we learned here. 
[03:48:00]  Hmm.  What's a marshmallow gun at?  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  In someone's infinite wisdom, they decided to buy two marshmallow guns.  They shoot those little mini marshmallows that you put in hot chocolate.  Where?  All over my house.  Who the fuck invented...  This is a guy that hates kids.  Are you fucking kidding me?  It was in my basement.  Thank God they didn't know about the marshmallow guns when they came to my house. 
[03:48:30]  And, yeah, marshmallows are being shot all over, and I'm trying to pick them up.  And the worst offender was my drunken Aunt Yvonne.  Oh, my God, was she hammered.  And she's just shooting them into Danny's face and little kids.  And she's just like...  And then somebody...  God damn, what a bunch of fucking drunks.  Somebody decided, let me grab a beer and, you know, pulled the tap handle, filled up their glass, and then walked away. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, good.  And about, I don't know how many gallons of beer just spilt out all over the floor of the barn.  Wow.  Are you serious?  So we're down there, and my Aunt Fran is a saint.  And she's able to, you know, clean very well and everything like that.  So everything got cleaned up.  But Yvonne, at that point, is looking around, and we're all...  Like, this is a big thing.  We're all just, like, grabbing paper towels, anything we can, and kind of a little panicky that so much beer spilt on the floor. 
[03:49:30]  I don't want the place to smell like a brewery and stuff like that.  And Yvonne just leans over at one point and goes,  Why are you doing so many dishes back there?  Thinking like we're washing dishes behind the bar.  Just not a clue of what was going on.  She's probably the one that did the fucking tap.  I was thinking maybe hit it for something with a marshmallow gun.  I don't know.  It was just...  Dude, I want to know about this marshmallow.  This sounds like the worst kid toy ever.  You pull the thing back and forth.  There can't be a worst kid toy.  It goes, dook, dook, dook, dook, and just rapid fire pumps out little tiny Swiss-miss-sized marshmallows. 
[03:50:00]  All over the house?  Yes.  Were people stepping on them?  Yeah, a couple of people stepped on them.  And then now you're just walking on rugs and whatever.  Stepping on a freshly fired marshmallow isn't that bad.  It's after the marshmallows have been reloaded, like, three or four times, that now they're, like, soft and mushy.  Mushy.  Then they get sticky.  Why would you allow that in your house?  I shouldn't have.  Hey, look, he's got a marshmallow.  Put it in the fucking car. 
[03:50:30]  It's not really Anthony's house at this point.  He just lives there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's everybody else's house.  Yeah, whatever.  But all the marshmallows did come up.  I think Danny had to scrape, like, the floor at one point.  But that's insane that they even have something like that.  Oh, I know.  That's insane.  There's no need to have that.  A marshmallow gun.  Christ almighty.  I know.  Enough.  How'd you do with the thing?  Oh, then, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so then you fleed.  So I fled.  Went there.  I was going to stay for a few days. 
[03:51:00]  You should be on Jersey Shore.  Anthony fleed.  I fleed.  Jesus.  I was doing good today, too.  Went, me, Danny, and Keith went down to the Borgata.  Hung out down there.  They just hooked up.  Big, sweet, butler, whole thing.  Oh, wow.  You call up and go, like, yeah, I need reservations at this restaurant for this time. 
[03:51:30]  Okay.  There's no, like, well, we don't have the...  Well, that's because of, you know, your action.  Well, yeah.  You got to explain that to them.  The entertainers don't get treated like that.  Believe me.  It was nice.  That's because of the action.  It was nice.  I mean, fucking nice.  Hung out there and wound up, I was going to come home, I guess, Wednesday or something  like that.  And my brother was down, too.  That's right.  My brother came down, too.  So we're all just gambling, having a fun time and everything.  And then Wednesday rolled around, like, what the...  Where am I going? 
[03:52:00]  Why?  So I called up and I said, I'd like the room till Sunday.  All right.  You got back yesterday?  Yeah, I got back yesterday afternoon.  Wow.  They were just like, all righty, no problem.  So I stayed there, did some power gambling, just power gambling.  A few listeners, too, hanging out.  Had a good time.  And must say, without being specific, I did okay. 
[03:52:30]  You tweeted a picture.  That was early.  That picture was pretty impressive.  Oh, no, that was way early, let me tell you.  But wasn't that...  No, that was...  That's it?  Yeah.  It looked like that.  Yeah.  No.  That was...  Man.  Wow.  It was a...  A good time was had.  Wow.  Wow.  And, yeah, I will be going back.  And believe me, they will be welcoming me with open arms. 
[03:53:00]  Why don't they take you to the back room and just fucking knock you out?  I know.  Take a saw.  You know it's happening.  You know it's happening.  Take the saw out.  Yeah.  Take the hammer or the money.  You can't have both.  Yeah, see?  One...  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  That's, uh...  Eh.  Eh.  Eh.  I thought it was twice that.  No, because each one of those is eh.  I thought each one of those was eh.  Uh-uh.  Why not?  No.  No, the eh's are a different color. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, I know that.  Let's see that picture, Dan.  That's, uh, back at the, uh, back at the room.  Jesus.  But then there was, take that and triple it.  That's your room now?  Uh, part of it.  That was a, it was a, it was a huge two bedroom suite.  So, uh, Danny and Keith got to share the room with the two queen beds in it.  As they should have, being queens.  And no lock on the bathroom door.  Oh, yeah!  Keith, Danny's showering and Keith just walks in with the flip cam and starts videotaping 
[03:54:00]  naked Danny in the shower.  I'm gay.  I covered my cock, I got shampoo in my hair and then, you know, he's got the shot and  he's just standing there and I'm just cupping my dick and balls and I'm like, I'm like,  what do you want?  You got it.  What are you doing?  Let's go away now.  I'm like, dude, you should lock the door.  I was like, yeah, I should.  Okay, now leave.  Just lock.  Just fucking leave.  Uh, yeah, played a little poker.  I do good in poker until I don't do good.  I was, I was up, I was doing very well and then, eh, you make that move. 
[03:54:30]  You need a lot of patience to play poker.  Yeah, a lot of it's just fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.  You gotta hang in there and be very patient.  But, uh.  I don't like that.  That was good.  But, but, you know, just playing is fun, poker.  And it's not like you're losing a shitload of money.  Uh, like you can at blackjack.  But you can also make a lot of money at blackjack.  You do some three card?  That's, uh.  Uh, me and Danny played a little three card for a little while.  And I, I hit like the biggest hand possible.  Straight flush? 
[03:55:00]  No.  I mean, uh, royal flush?  Now there's called the, yeah, the, the mini royal.  The mini royal.  Which is the, uh, ace, king, and queen suited.  Right.  And it pays a hundred to one.  I know it does.  You know, all the years.  I hit that bitch.  You know, all the years, all the years I've played, uh, a three card I've never hit for  anything big.  Really?  I've only done, I think, the ten to one.  You gotta play long enough to keep your ass in the seat and hopefully you hit something.  My whole thing is though, when you do hit, cause, cause that's a luck game, you gotta walk.  Did you walk after the royal?  Fuck no. 
[03:55:30]  Hung out for a little while.  I, I wound up leaving with more money than I sat down with at that table.  But I don't look at three card, I don't look at the three card table thinking, here's  where I'm gonna make, you know, some money.  I like three.  That's just relaxing.  Yeah, three card is just a social, social good time.  Yeah, a lot of people at the table yapping and shit like that.  You gotta play three card with people, you know, or a cool table.  It's just fun and you don't even care your, you know, your odds suck.  I mean, Danny was laughing, just playing.  It was funny, cause that's exactly how, uh, that table was.  It was like, it was just like six, six guys there.  Just blackjack, you're hitting at the wrong time, then the whole table hates you and you're 
[03:56:00]  like, I'm just down here, I'm down here having fun.  I didn't read no fucking book.  We kept hearing, uh, other tables wooing, you know, cause that happens occasionally.  So then our table decided that we were just gonna be the most obnoxious pricks in the  whole place.  Good.  And just like, no matter what came out, it could have been a low pair.  We were, everybody was like, woo!  Woo!  We're making noise.  And, and, every deal.  There was some old fuck that was at a table across from us that just kept like quickly  turning his head and looking over, like he was so annoyed that we were wooing. 
[03:56:30]  Tough shit.  And Sandy the dealer who was giving the same fucking four jokes over and over again.  Oh God, that's right.  I forgot about Sandy the dealer.  Hi, Sandy.  She had just...  No, he.  No, he.  He had jokes?  Oh, he had a whole rep.  Cause he was a comedian.  And, uh, he's also, uh, on, on the radio.  So, yeah.  What's his name?  Sandy Beaches?  Good one, Chip.  Uh, Chip, can I tell you something about that? 
[03:57:00]  There was a, there was a Sandy Beach that did moorings in Buffalo.  For real.  Oh, really?  For real.  I know you're doing shit, but I have to bring that to the table.  So many Sandy Beaches.  That there was actually a Sandy Beach that did moorings in Buffalo when I was up there.  Sandy Beaches.  So you gotta know when to walk away.  Like, I did some gambling this week at the Hard Rock.  Oh, did you?  In, uh, Fort Lauderdale.  Oh, did you?  And, uh, I was up, dropped down to 20 on the video poker.  Oh.  Went up to 70.  Stopped.  Then I wound up losing some more, uh, so I, I walked away with $10. 
[03:57:30]  Hey, see, you walked away a winner.  Bet.  I didn't gamble at all on Saturday.  Uh, and it was my last, my last night there.  I, I had a great Friday night, and then I just decided, you know something?  I'm not even going back downstairs.  I'm not giving them one more dime back.  So I sat and watched crappy movies in the room, and, uh, Sunday, uh, morning, got up  and left.  You want to take this one, or should I?  Why?  Why?  How bad was the hangover?  That's exactly it. 
[03:58:00]  It was vomiting.  I said to myself, I'm just gonna lay here and throw up on myself with a cold cloth on my  head.  Let me think.  Um.  You were taking a sink shower.  All right.  Saturday morning was pretty bad.  All right.  But no, no, Saturday night was fine.  Went out to dinner.  You just didn't feel like gambling anymore?  I was done, and I, I was like, my brother was, came down again at that point, and I was  just like, you know something?  I'd already, I already did everything I could possibly do here.  Wow.  Uh, as far as gambling goes.  So why don't I just, I said, you know what? 
[03:58:30]  I'm not gonna give him back any money.  If I make more money, it's gonna, you know, it'll rule, but I've pretty much done okay  here this week.  You were in a good spot.  Let me, let me leave.  And, and again, when I got home, that was the time that, because the car comes in through  the carport area, which is heated, you walk in, drive out, so the first air that I actually  got from outside, from the time I left, um, Monday, was yesterday. 
[03:59:00]  You were down there a week?  A week without seeing outside.  Holy shit.  I did not see or, or, or feel the weather.  Like, everyone's like, oh yeah, it's cold, it's cold.  I'm like, I, I have no idea.  I did not leave a building for a week.  You missed a week of winter.  I know, it was great.  That rules.  It was fan-fucking-tastic.  Did you take in a show while you were down there?  No, I didn't.  What horrendous show was happening down there. 
[03:59:30]  They, uh, yeah, what was down there?  There's always one bad one.  There's like Lady Gaga's gonna be down there.  She's there the night I'm there.  Jimmy Norton.  Yes, Jimmy Norton.  Maybe she'll go to your show.  It's gonna be down there.  Yes, her and her giant shark fin clit.  Yes.  And then they maybe, like, like, there's a red card and a black card.  The red card, you know, when you get raided and stuff.  They rate you, you give them the red card.  Or the black card is like, oh, okay, I've been playing.  I, they gave me a titanium card.  And of all the tables I was sitting in, I had not even seen one the whole time. 
[04:00:00]  You're a whale.  I didn't have, I have a titanium.  What's that mean?  I don't know!  That means that there will be a backroom situation eventually with Anthony.  I don't know what the titanium is.  That's not good.  What does the card enable you to do?  Um, well, you get rated with the card.  So you, you give your card, um, when you get money, when you win money, as you're playing,  for how long you're playing, how much you bet, and things like that.  Basically, they know he, he bets a lot. 
[04:00:30]  And then you get, uh, dollars.  So they take care of that person, hoping that he's gonna come back and lose all his money.  You get dollars.  Yeah.  Yeah, you get comp dollars with that, that you can buy things with and stuff.  And all I know is I had, and this is not through winning, or this is just comp dollars.  It was, it's in the thousands of dollars, in comp dollars.  And that, I don't even have to use them to pay for the room or anything.  Like, they just tossed me the room.  It's amazing.  It's like, here's a suite for a week.  Amazing.  Gee, thanks.  You go to the spa? 
[04:01:00]  Oh, why would I do that?  Massage?  The spa's great, actually.  No, there's a...  I've been to the Borgata Spa.  Why would I go to the spa for a massage when in the suite itself is a massage room?  Is there really?  Yes.  I swear to you.  Table, massage table, separate room, everything.  And you could have, you know...  Did you get your ball bag rubbed?  I could have, when three hookers, which, uh...  You had hookers?  Nice.  Me and Keith were calling the Charlie's Angels hookers.  Yeah.  Because there was a black one, an Asian one, and a white one. 
[04:01:30]  Oh, you know.  And they came up to me at the table, one of the tables, when I was playing.  And it was, you know, a high-stakes table.  And they come up and just start talking.  And I'm just like, wow, these girls really must like us.  I just thought I was doing great with you.  You're a hooker!  Yeah, and they come up, and the Asian girl, like, had a tulip or something in her hand.  Yeah.  And she puts it under my nose and goes, I just want you to smell my flower. 
[04:02:00]  I'm like, oh, you mean your pussy!  You mean your sideways pussy!  And then they're hanging out.  She gives me her phone number or some shit.  And I'm like, yeah, okay, well, you know, I'm here.  She goes, well, you know where to get us.  And they walk away.  And then Keith goes, I gotta see how much they're even charging.  This is ridiculous.  So he goes up, and they wouldn't talk price in the building, they said.  Did he find out, though?  No.  He goes, ah, fuck. 
[04:02:30]  Where would they talk price?  In the room?  I guess in the room.  And they already got you.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, honey, for me to come up for my time, it's $300.  I ain't fucking...  But if you want...  It's a fucking scam.  First of all, I don't want...  Jimmy, how much would it be?  They know how much money he's betting.  They see his room.  They're probably gonna want $1,000.  They want $1,000?  They would want a lot of money.  Would you get the fucking, you know, the ass?  I would never go with those.  Would you get the ass for $1,000?  I don't know.  I would call Jimmy like an agent to negotiate my deal. 
[04:03:00]  Hi.  Yeah, no, that's not gonna wash, honey.  Who do you think you're dealing with?  This isn't my first time at the rodeo.  Exactly.  You don't even have a dick under that skirt.  What do you mean you want $800?  Uh-oh.  Uncle Paul's got Santa's list.  And he's off looking for the naughty children.  Mighty only one with a raging hot on.  But he'll return with more classic holiday moments from the ONA archives next.  A very warm, happy holiday to you and yours from the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[04:03:30]  Huh?  Sit back and enjoy more classic Yule-themed moments from the ONA archives as an Uncle Paul Christmas continues.  In this segment, some man calls up about how we used to run a scam over the Christmas lights, but nobody knows what the fudge is going on.  I always say fudge.  I don't like to use dirty talk.  You don't want to teach kids that. 
[04:04:00]  Vulgar talk.  I'm shoving my cock in your ass.  Who wants to hear that?  It's, hey, be quiet.  Hey, I'm putting my pee-pee in your new know-what.  Or in your bottom.  You know, or where the doo-doo comes out.  You don't use dirty talk.  You don't say, hey, put my prick in your mouth.  That's vulgar.  You might go, oh, look at this.  A little bit of cookie dough fell on the eel.  Give him a kiss and taste the cookie dough. 
[04:04:30]  Yay.  It's the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.  We got the Christmas lights scam.  Christmas lights.  Yeah, what could that possibly be?  Let's hear Christmas lights.  Yeah, you find people with Down syndrome and sell them to them in July.  Hear a dumbbell.  Put these on your big head and run around like Santa Claus.  What's the scam?  Yeah, Jimmy, Staten Island.  Christmas lights.  I used to think I'd have to put myself through college and shit.  So what I would do is, I would carry the case of empties. 
[04:05:00]  You know, empty lights, empty light boxes in the truck.  And then what I would do is, I would turn around, I would charge the lights, I'd pay $2.25 for the set.  I'd come for $10 for the guarantee.  If the light set went out, I would turn around, come back, and replace it.  Now, if the customer was a real jerk off, I'd bang him the fuck out.  And I'd put out a extra case of empties.  And it's 48 sets in the case.  So who the fuck is going to turn around and count fucking plugs?  Fuck you, pay me, I froze me like the golf, have a nice day.  What the hell was that? 
[04:05:30]  All I know is this is organized crime.  That was some kind of organized crime thing.  The guy's a real jerk off.  Yeah, this isn't an innocent scam.  People died because of this.  Right.  Like, if it didn't work, he just hit him with a wrench.  Fuck yeah, I gotta bust your fucking legs.  What was the scam?  I don't know.  Merry fucking Christmas.  I don't know either.  The scam was that call.  They know a guy in Idleweiss Airport.  Idleweiss.  Is that what it was?  Idlewild.  Oh, whatever.  Idleweiss. 
[04:06:00]  That's the Jewish airport right next to Idlewild.  Idleweiss Airport.  That was terrible.  Are we done?  You get a family.  They want some lights.  You give them...  You give them, boom.  You bang them out.  You fucking whack this motherfucker out.  I swear to God, I am going to break your wife's fucking legs.  I say, you bite these fucking lights out.  Break your fucking head.  Merry fucking Christmas.  Merry fucking Christmas with your fucking lights.  You have a stick of 48 who's counting plugs.  You motherfucker.  Hey, you want some Christmas lights here?  Come down the block. 
[04:06:30]  I got some Christmas lights.  I got them.  No, in there.  In there.  Right in there.  The kid starts to swing.  Make him an offer that no one refuses.  Oh, shit.  Well, now it is time for a break.  I guess we got a little break.  Yeah.  I think we might have to do that.  What, am I in the mafia or something?  Oh, boy.  The whole commercial break where you were just cracking up over the Christmas light scam  guy.  Because we couldn't figure out what the fuck he was talking about.  We can't figure it out.  Same.  The least.  Boom.  And he knows that someone's a jerk off by meeting him in a parking lot. 
[04:07:00]  It sounds like he's selling Christmas lights in a parking lot, I think.  It was the most aggressive.  That was not a scam.  That was an outright aggressive crime.  Here's what I heard.  I had a box of 48 fucking lights in the back of my truck.  I'd go up to this guy and say, you want to buy some Christmas lights?  Boom.  I bang him out.  I go to that fucking thing.  And then I guarantee, I say, if the lights don't work, I come back and take care of them.  Boom.  That guy's a jerk off.  I don't need him anymore.  Yeah.  Because who's counting plugs? 
[04:07:30]  Who's counting plugs?  So I get in the parking lot.  Hey, you, you, you.  You want to buy some lights?  Come here.  Come here.  You.  Come here.  I couldn't understand his scam.  This guy's a jerk off.  This guy's a jerk off.  That guy's a jerk off.  Everyone's a jerk off if they just walk away uncomfortably.  Yeah, yeah.  Because a man's harassing him in the Home Depot parking lot.  They don't want Christmas lights scam fucking Guido to fuck him over.  Yeah.  Can we take another call from that guy?  I bang him out.  I got to understand what his scam is. 
[04:08:00]  What's wrong with you jerk offs?  You don't understand what I'm doing?  I got some lights.  I got some people.  Are we in agreement that he's selling Christmas lights in parking lots?  Yes.  We know that much, right?  Yeah.  But there's empty boxes.  He had empty boxes.  What does that mean?  So you're getting a carton?  I don't know.  But the carton would be open.  But some of the boxes would be empty if you had a jerk off.  There was 24 lights.  But I'd sell the 48s.  And then give him the 24, say, bang this guy out.  Everybody loves the 48s.  Everybody knows everybody loves the 48s.  But I guarantee it, too. 
[04:08:30]  I tell him that if a light goes bad, I come back, I give you the new ones.  He's coming back to where?  I don't know.  Back to the parking lot.  What the fuck was he talking about?  That guy was insane.  Light goes out?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  Can't find a plug?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  Box is empty?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  You want the icicle kind hanging from the gutters?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  Pay me.  Just the red ones don't work?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Pay me.  Ain't blinking right?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  You want an inflatable Santa? 
[04:09:00]  Fuck you.  Pay me.  I don't get his scam.  I don't either.  You want the reindeer whose head bobs up and down?  We're obsessed with this guy, though.  That guy was insane.  Come on.  Call back.  We'd go into the Lowe's like we own the place.  For guys like Gus to dress up like Santa any other way.  They drive into the parking lot of Home Depot and they just make a space for them in front.  He's just sitting in a folding chair in the Home Depot parking lot in August with a little fan on him. 
[04:09:30]  Just sweating.  Hey, come here.  It's not too early.  Think about Christmas, jerk off.  Bang this guy out here.  Hey.  Over there's Jimmy Christmas lights.  Over there's Tommy Christmas ornament.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Johnny fake tree.  This guy is all about his dumb Christmas lights schedule. 
[04:10:00]  And we don't know what the fuck he was talking about.  I didn't even call back.  Come on.  What are you going to wait for December to buy this shit?  Buy it now.  Buy it now.  I don't want it.  Buy it now.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, no.  And then the guy comes dressed like Santa Claus and he goes, you want cement cookies or something?  Oh.  Yeah.  The music just stops.  Fucking rat.  Whole family fucking rats.  I'm stalling because I want Christmas lights guy.  I don't think Christmas lights guy is going to call back.  Yeah.  Bastard.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Yeah. 
[04:10:30]  What are you looking at?  Why, why, why?  You want to go in there?  You want to go in there and buy Christmas lights?  It's good.  You can fucking get ripped off, you fucking jackass.  Fucking jerk off.  Fucking jerk off.  This guy's a jerk off.  I bang him out.  I bang him out.  I don't even know what banging him out means.  I bang him out.  Something with metal.  And no one's counting plugs?  And empty boxes.  What the fuck does that mean?  He's got empty boxes.  I'm fucking.  Now we got to figure this out on our own.  I can't figure this scam out. 
[04:11:00]  This guy's just a fast talker.  Family of four on the way into the mall.  Oh, just walking from the car, like, just walking faster, faster, looking over the shoulder.  This guy's like, come here, come here, come here, come here.  I got lights.  Come here, come here.  Yeah.  Then I had to go to the store and get the empty boxes, put them back in the back of my car.  Because I had to pick up the 48 Christmas lights from Jimmy, and I knew they weren't the right fucking lights.  I went there, he had the 24s.  I picked them up anyway, because I know that the guys coming up from Columbia can use the 24 lights. 
[04:11:30]  So I bang him out.  No one's counting plugs.  I'm like, Karen, keep rolling the dough.  We got the cookie dough.  We got the cookie dough for the Christmas cookies.  My brother's putting tinsel on the tree.  I come back.  I see a big sleigh chasing me out.  There's a giant sleigh.  There's a giant sleigh chasing me out.  What the fuck is this?  It's mine.  Can you hand it over?  Sorry.  What the fuck is this?  We got to go Christmas, Carolyn. 
[04:12:00]  We got to get our Santa costume.  I got to get back.  And with this cookie dough, it's still rock hard.  Karen, we needed that Christmas tree stand.  What are you doing, Karen?  Karen.  And then Lois comes in and I go, where's Superman?  What are you, Lois Lane or something?  So, Tom, what else is going on with you?  You know, just hanging out in the city.  Yeah, doing a lot of stand-up, playing with the kids.  How about you? 
[04:12:30]  Sipping on a smoothie.  That's good.  What's that, strawberry?  It's actually peanut butter.  Can I please hear the end of that in the last five seconds?  I didn't know you were going to do a music cue.  That was so funny.  Not the music cue.  He's the x-ray blanket of comedy.  Just throws it over you.  You can't move. 
[04:13:00]  Laughs cannot get through.  That's funny.  You don't have to worry that you're getting too many laughs per year.  Like a heavy x-ray blanket.  That was...  We got that, Iraq.  Woo!  It was funny.  What are you doing, Karen?  Karen!  And then Lois comes in and I go, we're Superman.  What are you, Lois Lane or something?  So, Tom, what else is going on with you?  Wow, that ruined everything. 
[04:13:30]  Everyone's having fun.  And it just fucking...  It just goes, wow.  It just goes, wow.  Everyone's on.  It spoils everyone's fun.  Oh, my God.  It was like a gas attack.  Uncle Paul's gone to make sure the children are nestled all snug in their beds.  But he'll return with more holiday-themed radio gold from the O&A archives.  An Uncle Paul Christmas continues next.  We now return to an Uncle Paul Christmas. 
[04:14:00]  Huh?  Warm and cozy holiday moments from the O&A archives with your host, Uncle Paul.  Oh, I remember this one.  Jim Florentine talked about the adults should be giving each other presents or they shouldn't be.  And Black Friday's awful.  My friend Barry used to give Jim wrestling pictures.  We would take the wrestling pictures and little Jimmy Florentine would come over and kiss you on the cheek. 
[04:14:30]  I'd tell you, he'd fuck for some ring-worn shorts.  You could fuck young Jimmy Florentine for some ring-worn shorts.  Or maybe a little piece of the mat you cut off.  Oh, he'd give up the bottom for that.  Well, this was a lot of fun hosting all this stuff.  I want money!  It's the worst of the O.P.N. Anthony show.  Well, that was a big part of my Black Friday podcast is enough with the gifts.  Oh, really?  Yeah, for adults.  No more gifts.  Just fucking stop it.  The economy's in the shitter. 
[04:15:00]  Nobody has money.  Everybody's fucking debt-ridden.  The reason we've been in a recession for six years is because everybody's just buying shit that they don't need.  Can't afford.  Gifts are for kids.  That's it.  You want to get your chick something for her birthday?  That's fine.  You get a gift there.  No more Christmas.  Just fucking no more gifts.  Yeah, what kind of illiterated society are we living in?  I go, yeah, I want the new Deep Purple DVD.  Okay, so I know what I'm getting.  So I open it.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, that's what I wanted.  I could have just went and got it myself.  It's fucking stupid. 
[04:15:30]  No, it's no more.  And you got it kind of right.  I love it because you do have to pretend like you didn't ask for this.  Yeah, because what do you want?  Give me a couple flannels.  Yeah, I'm going to wear them.  And I went, all right.  Oh, thanks.  I needed these.  It's fucking stupid.  It just causes problems.  Oh, thank you.  You badmouth the person when you walk away.  Fuck the fucking shit.  They got him in Old Navy.  I wanted something at least fucking better than that.  Throw this in the wash once.  It's going to shrink.  I'm never going to wear it again.  I hate when people buy me clothes.  I'm with Jimmy, man.  Yeah.  His mom buys him clothes that he never wears. 
[04:16:00]  Same here.  Jim's a Grinch.  Why?  I just wanted to say that.  Oh, logically.  Makes sense.  No, it's just stupid.  Oh, you got me gloves.  Thanks.  Gloves.  Fuck.  For kids.  Like 18 and younger should get gifts.  Other than that, no more gifts.  And they're all excited about it, so it's cool that way.  But an adult, you're right.  It's very immature to think like, oh, it's time to just give people shit that they probably  wouldn't buy on their own.  Like, if I'm not going to buy it on my own, don't get it for me.  Well, my wife gets pissed because I pick this time of year to get all the stuff I want. 
[04:16:30]  Yeah.  While I'm out shopping, I'm like, oh, I'm finally shopping, so I need some things.  So I come home with all this shit, you know, by accident.  And she's like, great.  And what am I going to buy now?  I'm like, I don't know.  I'll figure it out.  My family finally realized, like, they're not going to stop me from buying shit on my own.  I didn't get to this point in my life and get lucky enough to reach this point where  I'm not going to buy everything I want when I want it.  But I picked this time of year to finally go and get the shit I need. 
[04:17:00]  Yeah.  How stupid is that?  Well, I do it then.  Well, because most of the shit comes out now, like the new Rage Against the Machine, like  the 20th anniversary edition of the first record came out.  It's a big box set.  It's like a hundred bucks.  And I bought it the first day it came out.  Why wouldn't you?  I'm like, well, I was going to get you that.  I'm like, I'm not fucking waiting to December 25th to listen to this.  It came out November 27th.  I want to hear it the day it came out.  How was it?  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Games like, you know, Call of Duty.  I picked that up, like, when it came out. 
[04:17:30]  And people are like, oh, I knew you liked games and I was going to get you that.  Now, what am I not going to play for a fucking month?  While I wait?  Oh, boy.  What am I, three?  The only time it's okay to say that is, I was going to get you that, if somebody tells  you they have cancer.  Jesus.  You don't like getting up early for Black Friday, Jim?  That's a whole thing.  It's not bad.  But that's the whole part of the whole gift thing, that people got to get up and do that  shit.  And just that Walmart and a bunch of other places started opening on Thanksgiving night. 
[04:18:00]  So all these families got to, you know, these people that work there got to leave their  families on Thanksgiving.  You know, you don't see them that often.  Got to go to work at eight o'clock because these fucking assholes got to go shop.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of Walmart workers were going to say they're not showing up for that, which I don't  blame them.  If you're going to do it at fucking five in the morning or six in the morning on Friday,  I could kind of understand it, but not Thanksgiving night.  Can you just hang with your family?  Yeah.  Why do you have to now bust up the whole fucking party thing to get a little edge up? 
[04:18:30]  Oh, we're going to go.  Yeah.  Get online because I got to get online.  People have plans like they map out plans.  All right.  We get in the door.  You go to the electronics.  I'll go over to clothes and we'll meet at register six.  Really?  Is that your fucking plan?  Who would want to hang out with people like that that came up with a plan like that?  A Black Friday plan.  Yeah.  This is going to be fun.  We went in there.  You know what?  You know what the electronics are.  You run right back there.  Then I'll go over to clothes.  You pick up the stuff.  We'll meet at register six. 
[04:19:00]  Register six.  All right.  Yeah, I'm there.  We'll want the person maybe to go to the register and then we'll just meet them there  with our stuff.  Do you think that happens?  That's exactly what happens.  They map it out.  I know they do.  Mapped out.  People are calling you a killjoy.  A killjoy.  Anyone that used that word deserves not to get any presents.  Oh, it's Kevin from Con.  He writes, Florentine is a killjoy.  No presents.  No fancy football.  No, no, no, no, no.  Not even.  Well, that's it for an Uncle Paul Christmas. 
[04:19:30]  Uncle Paul will be back next year, as long as we're not recording within 1,000 feet of  a school or daycare facility.  Huh?  Season's best to you and yours from the Opie and Anthony Show. </pre>
