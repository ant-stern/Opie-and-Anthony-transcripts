<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts defiantly rejecting the notion of “nice” radio, immediately launching into a barrage of vulgar jokes and nonsensical pronouncements.  A caller, Chris from Texas, discusses his newfound appreciation for the *Back to the Future* trilogy after the show’s coverage.  This leads to a discussion of E-Rock’s bizarre CM Punk wrestling t-shirt depicting a fat skeleton. A listener poll confirms overwhelming support for a Saturday *Back to the Future* marathon.  The conversation then shifts to Christy Brinkley's swift and financially advantageous divorce from Peter Cook, sparking a broader discussion about high-profile divorces and the often disparate financial outcomes for men and women.  A failed *Back to the Future* trivia attempt by caller Mike concludes that segment.

Next, a news story detailing a father assaulting a grocery store employee accused of groping his four-year-old son is covered, followed by a discussion of the charges against both parties.  Caller Ryan mentions a previously discussed teacher, Pamela Rogers, triggering a graphic discussion of teachers having sexual relationships with students and the perceived impact of the teachers' attractiveness on sentencing.  This includes explicit details of a video featuring Pamela Rogers.

The show then tackles the controversy surrounding the removal of "Men at Work" signs in Atlanta due to sexism complaints.  The ensuing debate covers women in construction, the perceived attractiveness of flag girls, and the distraction they may pose to drivers. A female caller working in construction challenges the complaints, while other callers discuss attractive flag women in the South.  The hosts debate whether this is an example of excessive political correctness.  Details about a magazine editor involved in the controversy and her actions are discussed.

The hosts then delve into the purportedly racist implications of terms like "black hole," "angel food cake," and "devil's food cake," as highlighted by a Dallas County official.  A conversation with caller Malik explores the connotations of words containing "black," including a discussion on "blackballing."  The segment concludes with further debate on racial connotations, movie reviews (Hellboy II, Meet Dave, Journey to the Center of the Earth), the anniversary of Babe Ruth's baseball debut, and the removal of dog meat from Olympic restaurant menus in China.

The show then focuses on the release of the iPhone 3G, comparing it to the BlackBerry, discussing its features (3G, GPS), and highlighting its limitations (no picture messaging, cumbersome email picture viewing).  Sam interviews people lined up outside the Apple store, including professional line-stander Greg Packer and Jeff, who had been waiting since the previous morning.  Callers discuss the email versus texting issue, and the "F.U. Line" segment is included.  A brief news clip showing firefighters extinguishing a tanker fire is shown.  Studio guests Greg Proops and Stephen Lynch arrive.  A lengthy discussion follows about "The Who Farm," a group who waited in line for the iPhone to promote their campaign for an organic White House farm.  The hosts debate the merits of various cell phones, including the LG Dare and Samsung Instinct, and engage in political commentary on Jesse Jackson and the upcoming presidential election, including a discussion on the relative ease of criticizing white versus black public figures.

A significant portion of the show focuses on the 2008 Presidential election, criticizing John McCain's perceived lack of presidential demeanor and appearance through crude comparisons to historical figures, and harshly criticizing George W. Bush's presidency and perceived inaction on rising gas prices, suggesting a conspiracy.  This leads to a tangent about the Enron scandal.  Comedian Stephen Lynch, along with Joe Berg, performs a lengthy and crude set, including a reluctant revisit of his infamous "Almighty Malachi, Professional Bowling God" song and several new songs, one a graphic, anachronistic composition, and another a diary entry from the perspective of Christopher Reeve. Further improvised diary entries from Rodney King and a Farrah Fawcett parody are also included. Greg Proops also contributes commentary and jokes.  A hypnotist is introduced, scheduled to hypnotize “Stalker Patty” to explore her potentially abusive childhood.

The next segment focuses on Patty, a caller who previously detailed alleged abuse by her foster father.  The hosts, along with Roland and Steve, attempt to elicit more information through hypnosis with Don the Hypnotist.  After a recap of Patty’s previous accounts (foster father shaving while she bathed, sleeping on the couch with him), the conversation becomes sexually explicit.  There are delays and humorous interruptions, including Roland refusing to be hypnotized.  Jokes about drug use and Roland's childhood are included.  Joel McHale from "The Soup" briefly joins. Under hypnosis, Patty initially recalls positive memories but later reveals details about a strained relationship with her foster parents, including her foster father's inappropriate behavior in the bathroom and unwanted physical contact.  The attempt proves largely unsuccessful, with the segment ending with a farcical attempt to induce a sexual response.

The final segment features Patty subjected to increasingly bizarre and vulgar hypnosis routines by Don.  The show begins with a discussion of Patty’s recent sexual encounter, detailing positions and penis size.  The hosts and guests (Greg Proops and Joel McHale) attempt to hypnotize Patty into believing she is a German porn star specializing in "shit porn," culminating in her being given a chocolate bar she believes is feces and encouraged to rub it on her face.  Further hypnosis attempts turn her into a racist chicken, and then make her believe her family is watching, leading to a verbal confrontation.  She is then hypnotized to yell "I like black dick" when "Roland" is mentioned and to believe farts smell like flowers.  The segment ends with Patty still under influence, smelling flowers, and the hosts discussing the show and their plans.  The language is extremely vulgar and sexually explicit throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Intimous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  All right, we get it.  Pat, how's it going?  It's going home.  Tord Johnson, bobbing for gonorrhea.  All right, this is a bust, lesbians. 
[00:01:00]  We're going to smell all of your fingers.  If it smells like a day in the fishing hole, you're under arrest.  We're blithering idiots.  That's fine, though.  I love my it is the, it is the, it is the.  I love you guys.  I'd suck all your all day.  Wow.  I think that's an endorsement.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Friday edition of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's go to Chris in Texas really fast.  877-212-ON-A is our phone number.  Chris in Texas.  How are you, Chris?  All right, boys.  Hey, man.  Good morning.  Turn the music down.  He's yelling at you.  Sorry.  Turn the music down, he says.  What's up, Chris?  Okay.  Okay.  First things first. 
[00:02:00]  Anthony, you're a deuce.  Why?  Because of y'all.  Freaking Back to the Future discussion yesterday.  I had to get online and watch all three.  You watched all three Back to the Futures because of this dumb radio show?  Yes.  I don't know how many times I've seen the damn movies, but thank you.  Wasn't it fantastic?  I'm a douche.  He's the one that sat there and watched it.  All right.  I'm actually, it's a stupid movie, but my car, I had problems with my car. 
[00:02:30]  You did?  Yeah.  What happened?  It's the flux capacitor.  Capacitator.  Capacitator?  Let's not do this right off the bat.  Well, it's close enough, Jim.  Wow.  No.  Now, how did you know that?  It's a lot to think of in the cab on the way over.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Right out of steam.  Good.  You haven't.  I thought maybe you watched it.  No.  You haven't.  No. 
[00:03:00]  You haven't drank the Kool-Aid yet.  Thank God.  No.  It's still me and you, buddy.  Me and you.  Let these clowns do their Back to the Future crap.  I thought Iraq was sick.  Why?  Sure.  Oh, the poor boy fell skin and bones.  Let's see your shirt.  What is that shirt?  Oh, my God.  I've never seen a fat skeleton before.  Oh, God.  He's a skeleton. 
[00:03:30]  Usually when you wear one of those skeleton T-shirts, you look kind of thin.  Looks like you've been to the gym a few times, but not in Iraq's case.  How'd you find a fat skeleton shirt?  I don't think it's the shirt.  What is that, Iraq?  It's a shirt with just the skeleton bones.  Of course.  It's like a full, like, chest.  Nigel Tuffin wore it on Spinal Tap.  Yeah, this Halloween costume from the Karate Kid.  Right.  That is awful. 
[00:04:00]  It's a wrestling T-shirt for CM Punk.  So, yeah.  What?  Who's CM Punk?  He's the world heavyweight champion.  In what league?  On Monday Night Raw.  Oh.  Really?  And what does the skeleton have to do with anything?  I don't know.  It just...  I thought it looked cool, so I wore it.  You thought that looked cool?  You thought that looked cool?  I might wear that to be ironic.  Moronic.  We noticed over at XM the other day that a big WWE shipment came in with a whole bunch 
[00:04:30]  of shirts and stuff.  So, Travis noticed that for the last three days, Eric's been wearing nothing but new  WWE T-shirts.  Oh, wow.  You love the WWE T-shirts, do you?  It was two out of the three.  Wow.  Freebie.  Well, tomorrow it'll be three.  All right, well.  Skeleton.  There you go.  E-Rock with a skeleton T-shirt.  That's great.  That is wonderful.  We have lots going on today, that's for sure.  By the way, this just in, a poll on Wack Bag. 
[00:05:00]  85% of the people polled want a Back to the Future show on Saturday night.  Well, then go do it.  Have fun.  You don't want to come in?  Hell no.  And the other 15% have girlfriends.  Nerds.  Total nerds.  The stupid nerds.  Well, you know what you guys could do?  You could do the Back to the Future radio show, and then you guys could all go LARPing. 
[00:05:30]  LARPing?  Have fun.  I don't think one has anything to do with the other.  We could all talk about it.  Yeah.  Trade our little trivia that we each know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talk about our favorite parts of each one.  Yeah.  Come on.  No?  Sounds fun.  What?  Hello?  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Anthony, I don't want to bring up a bad subject.  Oh, no.  But Christy Brinkley's divorce has been settled with this internet creep, Peter Cook. 
[00:06:00]  Just because the guy likes hanging out in front of the computer screen and cranking away.  Yeah, well.  It cost him 18 houses.  What?  He lost big time.  Yeah.  And the whole case took what?  A week?  Yeah.  Something like that?  Mine went on for three years.  Three years.  Christy Brinkley gets a divorce in about a week.  Week and a half, maybe.  How did that happen? 
[00:06:30]  I don't know.  It doesn't make sense.  But she has to pay him $2.1 million.  That sounds like he wins.  That's what Kenny goes.  Well, you know, she's got to pay him.  I go, no, Kenny, not really.  Doesn't really work that way.  She's probably worth $100 million.  Yeah.  And she had to pay him $2.1 million.  And that's mostly for legal fees.  I don't know what that's about.  But for legal fees.  So she pays him $2.1 million. 
[00:07:00]  She gets all 18 Hamptons properties.  18?  18.  One of them is worth $18 million alone.  So, Kenny, where did she lose in this?  Who paid for those things, though?  What do you mean?  Did she originally buy?  It doesn't matter.  To me, that would be marital assets.  You split them down the middle.  To me, if he was cheating, there's a high-profile case.  I'm not saying she's perfect, but he was trying to get her to have threesomes. 
[00:07:30]  He was banging a young girl.  He was a terrible husband.  Yeah.  He was terrible.  He's everything I would be as a husband.  StartBrain had a thought.  Mike, do you know something about this?  I was going to say the reason why the money will go to legal bills, and you said it was  a short divorce.  She caught him two years ago.  So there have been depositions and positioning and bills going for almost two years.  Okay.  And she gets primary custody of the kids.  Yeah.  Cook has huge legal bills, and the IRS is very interested in the $300,000 he paid in 
[00:08:00]  hush money to his mistress, Diana Bianchi.  So Peter Cook loses big time in this one.  Paid $300,000?  But Anthony's kind of right, man.  There are guys that are goody two-shoes out there, and the wife comes to them and says,  I want a divorce.  And it turns out the wife was doing all sorts of crazy crap.  And they split her right down the middle.  Right down the middle for marital assets.  And then the guy's got to pay support. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  Greg Norman just got divorced.  $103 million it cost him.  Wow.  $103 million.  I never once saw her make a putt.  Not once.  How much is he worth?  A lot.  He's got that wine.  He's got that charade.  Yes.  He's an entrepreneur.  So $103 million to the wife that never played golf.  Yeah.  Great. 
[00:09:00]  Wow.  When is all that going to change?  When is that divorce thing going to change?  Why should Christy have to pay anything in that case, though?  Like, the rare case where the woman is kind of the alpha moneymaker.  Why should she have to pay this guy $2-something million when he was outbanging somebody?  Well.  All she did was model and be sweet.  Well, she's the uptown girl.  I know.  I like that tune.  Probably she's rotten in the sack, though, because four husbands.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Something's going on there.  Mike in New York.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Well, know what it is, Jimmy. 
[00:09:30]  I think she doesn't want to get sloppy.  Yeah.  You're probably right.  To the women listening to us out there, you've got to get a little sloppy.  Especially the hot ones.  Yeah.  Your hotness isn't going to, you know, get the job done every single time.  You've got to get a little sloppy in there.  You've got to get a little nasty.  Right?  Like this sound.  No.  Mike in New York, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, just getting started.  Yeah, go ahead.  You just talked.  Sure, sir.  After all, I just called you.  You talked. 
[00:10:00]  Go ahead.  Talk.  All right.  Not so easy, is it, Mike?  No, let's go.  I was trying to have fun.  Yeah, when old Biff comes back to the future in 2015, and he walks out of there all lackadaisical,  how does back of Marty and Doc are still there?  I don't know.  See, they tried to explain it in the scenes.  Wait, did you get, you just got stumped by a back to the future question?  I don't know everything. 
[00:10:30]  Wait.  They said that when they came out of the house, that everything had changed because they were  already outside of the house.  But if he had changed the future, then they wouldn't have been there.  But that's one of those inconsistencies that time travel is supposed to fix.  I have no idea.  I don't either.  Well, you can't do your back to the future show, then.  I know.  You're not an expert.  Well.  I just stopped the show.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:11:00]  Maybe one of the other guys.  Love you.  No, no.  I think that proves that we've got to move on from back to the future crap.  It was a fun bid for a couple days.  You guys were excited and had a good time.  But obviously, the bid is dead.  Yeah.  This guy has killed a bid.  Right?  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, I want to say hi to everyone listening to us on WBCN in Boston.  There's an amazing story coming out of Boston.  I don't really get this one, man.  A man accused of groping boy in a grocery store.  I get that. 
[00:11:30]  You do?  Jesus.  Hey.  Very nice.  Listen to this.  A four-year-old boy was allegedly groped in the bathroom of a grocery store by an employee.  And the boy's father took the matter into his own hands.  So we get into the part I don't get, okay?  The boy's father attacked the perpetrator during the incident at the market basket in  Rainham last month.  Police said that Valerio Rodriguez, 71, allegedly, listen to this, reached underneath a bathroom 
[00:12:00]  dividing wall and touched the boy high on his leg while he was standing on a bucket so  he could use the urinal next to him, next to this guy.  The boy's father, who was also in the bathroom during the incident, told police that he forced  open the door and beat the crap out of Rodriguez.  Bravo.  I mean, they say punched Rodriguez several times, but obviously he beat the crap out of 
[00:12:30]  this guy.  Good.  This creep.  Excellent.  This is what I don't get.  Police charged the boy's father with assault for hitting Rodriguez.  What?  Rodriguez told police that he was joking around, but he was charged with a felony account of  indecent assault and battery on a child.  So he's getting charged, obviously.  I was only joking.  But why are you charging the father for protecting his four-year-old boy?  Yeah.  That'll never stand up. 
[00:13:00]  You don't think so?  They'll drop that?  Yeah.  I bet the ghoul said, you know, he assaulted me, so the cops have to arrest him, but they'll  throw it out.  Guaranteed.  You're touching someone's kid.  You deserve what you get.  A fine beating.  Maybe he's right, though.  Maybe it was just the guy reacting.  He goes, no, I didn't do anything.  He just hit me.  So they had to arrest him because they don't know exactly what happened yet.  But now that it's obvious.  Yeah, I bet they dropped that.  We're going to have to follow this case.  So you think they'll just drop that charge? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  If they come to believe that the guy actually did grope the kid and that the guy's story  is true, oh, yeah, I think so.  How do you do that in a kidding fashion?  I know.  I know the guy's just reaching for straws, but come on.  I mean, what are you, nuts?  I was kidding.  Yeah.  Ryan in Chicago, how are you?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Ryan.  Hey, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Two really quick things.  Number one, Anthony, thank you for Kitty Thunderdome yesterday that had me laughing. 
[00:14:00]  And number two, I hate to bring up an old subject from yesterday, but I wanted to express  my disappointment in Steve Carlisi for forgetting the hottest teacher of all the teachers I got  in trouble.  Well, Steve wouldn't be picking out the hot teachers.  You know that.  Yes.  It was Danny.  Well, the thing is, he's got a video of her on his website.  It's Pamela Rogers.  Pamela Rogers is hotter than Deborah LaFarie.  Look her up.  She's on Foundry Music.  He's got a video of her.  She's a lot hotter. 
[00:14:30]  Of course.  Well, we don't need to go to Foundry when we can just Google image her.  Well, God knows you can't find it on Foundry.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember her.  Wow.  Wowee.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  Wowee.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Another hot teacher.  How many days did she get?  They probably apologized to her and sent her to the Caribbean for a nice vacation.  They put the kid in jail.  Was she from Albany or something?  Was she upstate New York?  I remember her.  Sure. 
[00:15:00]  Gosh, she's smoking.  Yeah, she's pretty hot, too.  How many days did she get for having sex with a child?  She got an eight-year suspended sentence.  Yes.  A suspended sentence.  I stood in the classroom like a fool.  Like a fool.  Eight years, see?  Going with what we started yesterday.  If you're a hot teacher, you don't get the hard jail time.  Of course not.  No.  All right.  Wow.  By the way, when Biff returns the DeLorean to 2015, it's an alternate timeline he returns 
[00:15:30]  it to, not the original one.  You're reading this.  So we're unable to really see any changes.  You're reading this.  They're all outside.  You're reading this.  And they didn't spend much time in 2015 after that.  Too late.  You're reading this.  By the way, the Back to the Future writers confirmed this in their frequently asked questions.  Yeah.  Alternatively, from Doc and Marty's point of view, the ripple effect would need time to catch up. 
[00:16:00]  They would experience two different timelines.  One where Biff returned the DeLorean to the original 2015, and one where the ripple effect  had caught up and the DeLorean was returned to the alternate 2015.  So that answers that gentleman's question from earlier.  Yes?  Not to get away from Back to the Future, but there is a Pamela Rogers update.  She violated her parole by sending more nude pictures of herself to the kids.  Holy Jesus. 
[00:16:30]  Are you kidding?  What did she mail it to?  Luckiest boy in the world.  The judge.  USA.  The judge sent her to jail.  Any town.  She's in jail.  She's told to serve the seven years.  What is wrong with the boy?  Can't he keep his stupid mouth shut?  You've got one of the hottest teachers in the country sending you naked pictures.  Just shut up and enjoy it.  Holy mackerel.  This kid's dinks.  What a dummy.  How did she get caught?  He couldn't have told his mother.  I'd put those pictures in a safe deposit box.  Right.  My space or something?  Isn't that the one, Mike? 
[00:17:00]  She was MySpace-ing him.  Really?  Danny, you got an update on this?  No, I just want to show you the video that she sent to one of these kids.  Oh, no.  Stop.  There's a video.  Is it the inline skating video?  Holy mother of God.  All right.  Teacher arrested.  This is on Break.com.  This is a teacher.  She's in thigh highs.  Look at her hiney.  Holy crap.  She's in a little tee back.  She's wiggling her bootay on the webcam.  Oh, my God.  Look at that. 
[00:17:30]  She sent this to a kid?  14-year-old kid.  Wow.  Why is that in jail?  They should show that ass to a jury and go, come on.  Find me a jury.  This kid.  Holy mother of God.  She's in a black thong and bra.  Yeah.  White stockings and black gloves.  Oh, my God.  If he snitched, I'm going to hunt him down and kill him.  Yeah.  What is wrong with him?  Wow.  How about a little? 
[00:18:00]  Right there, Jim.  No, I've been biker.  Look, wait.  There's more.  I went to the gym.  I was.  There's more.  In January of last year, they tacked two more years on to her sentence because she sent  more nude pictures of herself to the kids.  Get the hell out of here.  She appears to like sending nude pictures to kids.  Would you say she likes sending nude pictures to children?  I don't think she.  She doesn't seem to like it.  No?  No.  Because I would think she likes it. 
[00:18:30]  I think.  You just think.  She loves it.  Wow.  Wow.  Hey, E-Rock, what's the.  She can't stop.  What's the search on break?  Because the people need to see this video.  Oh, you need to see it.  Oh, boy.  You put in teacher arrested for sexy video.  And that really is the video she sent.  Wow.  Wow.  Her ass.  It's like a shelf ass almost.  It's like she has.  It's for a white girl.  It's rare to have that kind of perfectly like oblong, sexy cheeks. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  What she's doing.  She's got one of those asses.  When she bends over, you got to mind the gap.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Mind the gap.  I like to call it mind the gap.  There's a lot of like space in between that goes up like a nice perfect heart.  Wow.  She sent that to.  Would you tell your mommy if this was sent to you?  Not even if it would cure mommy's brain tumor. 
[00:19:30]  We got to find out after the break how she got caught sending these videos and stuff.  Because someone always rats.  But there's not a kid alive that would rat.  It has to be one of his dumb friends.  Yep.  Where the mother was on his MySpace.  I bet you the kid made the mistake of showing some of his friends he thought he could trust.  And one of them was probably a little jealous and went to his mommy.  Yeah.  And then that mommy got a hold of that mommy. 
[00:20:00]  And now this luscious specimen is stuck in jail for a while.  Her ass.  That beautiful ass won't be touched for seven years.  Oh, it'll be touched.  I mean by the proper authority.  Yeah.  So wait.  Where was she from?  Was she in upstate New York?  Perfect.  Perfectville.  Perfectville.  Yeah.  That's true.  Face mask ink.  Hey, who was the one from upstate New York?  Wasn't there one from Albany?  There was a really pretty one from Albany, I remember. 
[00:20:30]  She was a teacher.  Erica Nagel?  The vivacious Erica Nagel.  I look straight ahead.  I mean, you do something you don't like.  Elok just looks straight ahead.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  He does not pay attention to any goofing done on him.  No.  He just wants it to go away.  All right.  So we're going to find out why she got caught after the break.  And wow.  She's a delight.  Wow.  Delight's an excellent word.  She's a delight.  It's a delight.  A delight. 
[00:21:00]  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to link something to onaradio.com.  It's basically a who's who of teachers that have slept with their students.  Yeah.  I've been scrolling through it.  Some hotties.  Yeah.  We're all picking out our favorites.  There's something about that, man.  Our favorite statutory rapists.  Well, look at them, though, man.  Some of them are beasts.  Some of them are pigs. 
[00:21:30]  But this weeny, Nick Kellany, 25, she's a looker.  Yeah.  And Angela Comer, come on.  Who wouldn't?  Right?  You with me?  What's her last name?  C-O-M-E-R.  M-E-R.  Oh.  Yeah.  Comer.  I think there's only one way to say her last name.  Sure.  It goes on.  Wow.  Look at that pig.  Brenda.  Oh.  Brenda Lynn Gonzalez.  I hope she gets life. 
[00:22:00]  Or life cycle.  What a fatso.  Yeah.  Now, we were talking about Carrie McCandless yesterday.  Yep.  The picture we had of her yesterday, it didn't do her justice.  She is way hotter than Debra LaFarri.  LaFarri.  Really?  Look how hot she is.  I put her on an even keel.  No.  I think she's even hotter.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Her hair's a little messy.  Jimmy, is she hotter than Debra LaFarri? 
[00:22:30]  LaFarri.  I want to see her body.  I don't think so.  She's pretty, though.  But, again, she could be able to have a...  Yeah.  But Debra's body wasn't that great, we decided yesterday.  No, I just...  I thought she had a nice body.  I won't see her.  It was okay.  The face way better than her body.  Now, though, I give the body to that nut that was dancing around.  Oh, the video?  The video.  We have that video linked to One Radio.  You want hits today, stunt brain.  Oh, yeah.  Get that video up there immediately.  It's the video we were talking about before the break, where this teacher, forgot her name already,  a hot blonde with an amazing ass, sent a video to a 14-year-old. 
[00:23:00]  And she got caught, and now she's doing some prison time.  Pamela Rogers.  Pamela Rogers, right.  And then this who's who list, you've got to check that out.  We'll put the link on onaradio.com, and you can pick out your favorites.  And then, coincidentally, we're being heard in Buffalo right now.  Good morning to everybody in Buffalo, listening on the edge.  You've got a teacher up there.  Yeah.  Former South Buffalo school teacher, Cara Dickey, and Cara Dickey's pretty hot, too. 
[00:23:30]  Cara Dickey?  Another blonde is facing charges of unlawful imprisonment, promoting a suicide, endangering  the welfare of a child, and unlawfully dealing with a child.  Back in June, Dickey was dismissed from the school for having an alleged inappropriate  relationship with an eighth-grade male student.  Eighth grade, what are you, 14-ish?  Yeah.  There's a picture of Dickey.  According to the school, Dickey was confronted about having an inappropriate relationship  with the boy and told the school to stay away from him.  Later, the two were allegedly caught texting each other with their cell phones. 
[00:24:00]  The boy's phone was confiscated, and Dickey was dismissed.  On June 16th, both the boy and Dickey went missing for 24 hours.  Uh-oh.  The boy found safe at the McKinley Mall Dickey found in Springville.  So they went off to have a little fun.  A little liaison.  There was no word then if the two were together during that time period.  Buffalo police would not comment any further.  Dickey turned herself into police and is now being held, because she's hot, on $5,000 bail. 
[00:24:30]  I'll go get her.  Yeah.  I'll go get her.  And what, 10% gets her out?  500 bucks?  Hey, man, we should go get her right now.  JetBlue flies.  We could be there and back before the end of the show today with a hot teacher that's a goer.  Just go around bailing out hot chicks.  That should be our new...  I never even thought of that.  That should be our new cause.  That's a great thing to do.  Oh, the...  Just bail out hot chicks. 
[00:25:00]  The outrage.  But then there would be a bunch of guys that would understand.  Yeah, of course.  They would just understand in the end, right?  That's hilarious.  Just go around bailing out hot teachers.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's hot teachers that bang their students.  Why not?  Why not?  All right.  We got some politically incorrect things happening today.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  We're all losing our minds.  Oh, good gosh.  I hope no one was hurt.  You know those men at work signs you see all over the place?  Yeah.  Well, they have been ruled... 
[00:25:30]  It's going to drive Jimmy nuts, especially.  They have been ruled sexist in Atlanta.  Yeah.  They're going to be replaced, and this will happen all over the country now, with signs  that say, workers ahead.  The famous men at work signs are going away, people.  That's it.  Going away.  I guess I understand it, but how many women do...  Do that many women do construction?  I mean, literally, is it that prevalent?  Well, if you're... 
[00:26:00]  I've seen women on construction sites, and usually they want to be called a man.  Yeah, they should be considered men.  Yeah.  They're really a little butchy.  Show me one hot woman that's doing road work.  You ever see the flag?  They give her the flag to flag the cars through?  Right.  On the road thing, that's pretty much what they do, and it's always some huge woman.  Well, yeah.  If you had a hot chick doing that, there'd be accidents all over the place.  Yeah.  So you make sure they're...  Yeah, that's...  You make sure they're piggy, so you're not looking...  That's true. 
[00:26:30]  I never even thought of that.  I'm going to just use piggy all day.  That's a good point.  If she was hot, yeah, you wouldn't...  You wouldn't...  You'd stop.  I bet you there's construction companies out there that they secretly, behind closed  doors, go, look, we can't hire hot flag girls because it will cause accidents.  So get the pigs that are applying and hire them immediately.  And you'd slow down, stop, maybe try to talk to her.  Yeah.  Cause traffic jams.  I have to disagree with Ope's assessment.  Even though I think you're right, I don't think they have those conversations like that.  Like, you're painting it like they go, all right, look, we got the annual meeting. 
[00:27:00]  Who's got the minutes from last time?  We said we were all going to hire pigs.  All in favor.  Any fat ones?  Hi.  I don't know if they actually have it.  It's secret talk, Jimmy.  You know.  A little wink, a little nod.  Yeah, yeah.  They all know, though.  Yeah.  In the battle of the sexes, women's magazine editor Cynthia Good, let's get Cynthia Good  on the phone today, said this was a skirmish she had to fight.  She had to fight this one?  This is the one you dedicated your time and energy to?  These men at work signs have been out there forever and no one has even given a crap. 
[00:27:30]  Across Atlanta they stood, orange signs with black letters that read, men at work.  Does men at work mean anything?  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Forget it.  Turn it off.  Why wouldn't you do it right when he said it?  Yeah, E-Rock, why?  E-Rock, comment?  I had it loaded, but I didn't...  Yeah.  What?  I wasn't just going to play it while the story was going through.  Well, the thing is, we can't say, hey, do you got any men at work? 
[00:28:00]  Like, it's got to come in naturally and spontaneous.  Yeah.  So it's your job to kind of know when to pop that in.  You've got to weave this crap in there.  You have the musical cue ability.  Like, what he does, like, putting a record on a turntable and just waiting for, like,  a bull to run and then smash into it, right, and hit the on switch.  You come at any point.  Yeah, then I give you the hand signals if I'm not dinging it.  What happened to you?  Just take the risk.  Play this song.  You sound like men at work three times. 
[00:28:30]  At least.  You obviously have no guts.  See, because of his skeleton t-shirt.  That's true.  You're all skinning more skin.  Overkill?  Don't even try.  They were a one-hit wonder.  Don't go with the freaking second song that they try to shove down our throats back in  the day.  What are you saying that our jokes are overkill?  Oh. 
[00:29:00]  It's just the other song kind of sideways.  Yeah, that's what the 80s did to us.  They had a bunch of one-hit wonders, and they would throw a second song at you.  That almost sounded like the hit.  Yeah.  What was the third one?  No.  No, this is the big hit.  Who could it be now?  And Land Down Under?  Land Down Under?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, listen.  iTunes.  Wait, wait, wait.  This was the hit.  Yeah.  Because this was the Vegemite sandwich. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  But then the other one was a hit, too.  The other one was the third hit that he's claiming was the second hit.  The second hit was the first one he played.  This was the hit.  What the?  Exactly.  Let me get back to my Men at Work story, please, without the dumb music.  Do you come from a Land Down Under?  Quite enjoying it.  That's a tote out there.  Mm-dee.  All right, so these signs stood all over Atlanta for a very long time, and they read Men at Work  or Men Working Ahead.  Sometimes the signs stood next to Women Working Alongside the Men. 
[00:30:00]  That's what Cynthia Good is saying today.  Good.  Good demanded Atlanta officials remove the signs, and last week, Atlanta Public Works Commissioner  Joe Bastista agreed.  Why would he agree?  Don't agree.  Don't listen to this broad.  Shut up.  Score one for gender equality, Good said Wednesday.  Is that a really scoring one?  They get it, Good said, about the city in a telephone interview. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, God.  Public Works officials are replacing 50 men working with signs that say, Workers Ahead.  It will cost $22 to cover over some of the old signs and $144 to buy new signs.  Good.  Founding editor of Atlanta-based Pink Magazine, a publication that focuses on professional  women, says she's not stopping with Atlantis.  Sorry, Jim.  I just took a sip of coffee and said that. 
[00:31:00]  Can we look into this Pink Magazine, please?  Please.  That sucks.  Every month, there's a centerfold with a frown laying on her side.  An open hospital, Johnny.  Ew.  Pink.  There it is.  Ew.  How to get it back in. 
[00:31:30]  Well, you guys can enjoy Pink Magazine.  It's pinkmagazine.com.  I guess we pissed off a bunch of hot chicks that are flag girls.  Oh, yeah?  Let's go to Kim in White Plains.  One way to get girls to call.  Kim, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  Hi, Kim.  All right, you're not hot.  I can tell by your voice.  What's up, Kim?  What's up, Kim?  I actually am.  I just have a very deep voice.  And I do work construction.  I'm down on 287 in White Plains.  But I agree with you guys.  This political correctness has gone too far. 
[00:32:00]  I don't give a crap if signs say men.  It doesn't bother me.  I don't care, Grandpa.  I don't want to work in front of a men at work sign.  I won't.  I won't.  I won't.  I won't.  It doesn't bother me.  No, huh?  Yeah, right on to you, Kim.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Heath in Georgia.  Heath, what's up? 
[00:32:30]  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, just want to let you know, I've been driving a truck for about 17 years, and there's  some of the hottest chicks down here in Georgia that actually hold these flags.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  No doubt.  Cut off blue jeans, you know, just like you see on the posters and shit.  Cut off.  Hey.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Well, we had to dump out, but this guy's saying they have cut off blue jeans.  They don't hire girls to sit there in tiny little blue jeans shorts.  Daisy Dukes.  Oh, you see?  You guys are just stuck up there in New York.  You don't know what goes on down here in the South. 
[00:33:00]  You city people.  Look, Heath, we almost worked in Atlanta because they said it's just like New York.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Can I say, I don't, this doesn't drive me nuts.  It's a little silly, but it doesn't make me nuts.  Because it's not, it's just a matter of, all right, realistically, there's guys and women  working, so whatever.  But Anthony taught me a long time ago, you can't give in to any of this stuff, because  then they go on to the next thing, Jimmy, and then the next thing, and then it'll finally  get to something that will bother you.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  That's why you got to stop all this crap right here.  I like to consider it as men at work as, you know, mankind, you know?  It's sort of men, men being the, the...  I, yeah, well, I never drove by one of those thinking, we got one on the broads.  Yeah.  You didn't even think twice about it.  That'll show them.  Right.  That'll keep them down.  Well, good founding editor of Atlanta-based Pink Magazine. 
[00:34:00]  Why is it called Pink, by the way?  That sucks.  Yeah.  It felt good coming out, even though I stole this from you.  Well, Anthony makes, Anthony makes a good point.  You, you, you know, you don't mind that the color pink is associated with women.  Yeah.  Unless, I thought maybe it was a little, you know, deeper than that.  I thought maybe it was, uh, um, maybe a publication, uh, a lesbian publication.  Is it?  No.  Is it, Ero?  One of the stink was taken. 
[00:34:30]  Stink Magazine.  Stink.  No, Anthony.  It's a publication that focuses on professional women.  Oh.  And, uh, she's not stopping with Atlanta.  We're calling on the rest of the nation to follow suit and make a statement that we will  not accept these subtle forms of discrimination said good.  I bet it's 48.  It's full of pictures of women in smart pantsuits.  Is that it?  That pantsuit you're wearing is smart. 
[00:35:00]  Look, it's a woman dressed like, like a man.  You know how this all started, by the way?  It's so unsexy, those things.  You know how this all started?  How?  She, uh, decided to, uh, you know, to go with this thing after Atlanta police came to her  office last month on a complaint that she spray-painted W-O onto a men at work sign.  Men woe?  That doesn't make sense.  Why would she put, why would she, or she, why would she put men at woe work? 
[00:35:30]  You just did my joke again, putting the woe in the wrong spot.  Move it around a little.  No one knows nothing.  So there you go.  There you go.  That's, that's what she needs to be doing with her time.  That's wonderful.  And then you got another guy, um, here's a guy.  Here's a guy.  Uh, man says terms.  Can we get this story too?  Black hole. 
[00:36:00]  Oh my God.  Angel food cake and devil's food cake are racist.  Correct the mundo.  Yes.  Wait, is this?  Correct a mundo.  Is this the court case?  Yes.  This is, this is repugnant.  Uh, what do black hole, angel food cake, and devil's food cake have in common?  Well, they're all racist terms, says a Dallas County, Texas official.  A county commissioner's meeting this week over traffic tickets turned into a tense discussion  over race when one commissioner said the county's collections office was like a certain astronomical 
[00:36:30]  phenomenon.  Uh, it sounds like central collections has become a black hole.  Yeah.  Uh, commissioner Kenneth Mayfield, who was white said during the Monday meeting, one black  official demanded an apology and commissioner John Wiley price, who also is black said that  type of language is unacceptable.  Doesn't, don't they understand?  What do these idiots, do these morons understand that a black hole is, you know, uh, uh, something 
[00:37:00]  with such gravity that it just keeps pulling things in even light.  Right.  So it becomes, uh, black.  Right.  Nothing gets done really.  It prevents things from getting done.  What?  No.  Everything's being just sucked in.  Yeah, but that's, that's the term meant like, yeah, it was just, it was just, he's  right.  It was, everything was just being sucked in.  Nothing was getting accomplished.  Yeah.  That's, that's how I read this.  Yeah.  It was obviously the people that work in that department are all, it happens, they happen 
[00:37:30]  to be black.  I'm assuming, but that's not what the guy is going for here.  No one, no one, I would never make that association.  At the meeting, Mayfield said he intended his comments to be taken in the context of  the scientific meaning and became upset that he was being misunderstood.  Uh, in astronomy, the term black hole refers to a star that blah, blah, yeah, we already  did that.  Uh, so if, so if it's angel food cake, it's white.  If it's devil's food cake, it's black.  Yeah.  Is that, is that where that comes from?  Uh, well, angel food cake is white. 
[00:38:00]  And devil's food cake is black.  It's just the cake.  If you're the black, if you're the black sheep of the family, then you gotta be bad.  You know, white sheep, you're okay.  You know, Price said, Price said people should watch their words when it comes to stereotypes.  Well, Price makes a point about certainly, it's good that Price watched X by Spike Lee  and it's picking up the lessons that, uh, Malcolm X learned, uh, from the, uh, the Muslim  in jail.  But that, that's fine, uh, when you're dealing with that stuff.  But a black hole is a scientific, what do you, it's a scientific word. 
[00:38:30]  Everybody knows what it means.  Uh, I think people should always be careful, you know.  I'm okay if I'm bartering with you, but if I try to jew you down, ooh, is that racist?  I thought it meant the same thing.  No, maybe it doesn't.  He doesn't.  Well.  I think he understands the difference.  Yeah.  And he's just kind of using that, uh, as an example to make a point.  I got in trouble.  What?  With Ben Stein once for saying, chew you down. 
[00:39:00]  Remember that?  Ben Stein's an ass.  I know.  And I said, I said, chew.  Chew you down.  He goes, yes, but we all know what you meant.  And then pretty much hung up on us.  Yeah.  Good.  Good riddance.  I didn't like the way he, he might have even been right about the way the copy was written,  but it had nothing to do with you.  You were just reading it.  Yeah.  That was not, you didn't write that?  I was only following orders.  That's it. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, we got, uh, we got, uh, Malik.  Malik keeps us in touch with the community.  Malik, Asbury Park, what's up?  Yo, what up, what up, what up?  Yo, listen.  All right, I'm good.  What's up?  Listen.  Now, what you do, man?  That's the beauty.  Hold on.  That's the beauty of Malik's phone calls.  You hear police sirens in the background.  In the background.  And he doesn't even think twice about it.  It's like, ah, it's.  Go ahead, Malik.  Nah, and you know, they were just shooting up the clock, too.  But, yo, listen, anyway, um.  You ain't kidding.  Um, no, what you meant is that everything that has the word black in it is associated with 
[00:40:00]  something negative, like black hole, black ball, black listed.  Everything has a negative connotation behind it.  So, that's what they mean by, like, you know, it has, it has, like, a racist theme or racist  kind of thing to it.  Hold on.  Malik, you're right to a certain degree about certain things like black listed and black  sheep.  But black hole is simply black because it's the color of the absence of light.  Black hole, it actually fits color-wise.  It's not, it's not just an interpretation of bad equaling black, like black sheep. 
[00:40:30]  This is different.  This is actually the scientific term that is accurate physically.  Oh, yeah.  I gotta tell you, I never even realized, uh, the black sheep and.  I don't think black sheep is bad.  Black listed and all that.  I don't find that bad.  It's because most sheep are white.  So, the black sheep of the family is the one that doesn't fit in.  Why not the green sheep?  Or the blue sheep?  Because black is the opposite of white.  And sheep are white.  So, it makes, you know, it's the opposite. 
[00:41:00]  Are there black sheep?  I've never seen one, are there?  Oh, there are?  In real life?  I mean, do they, do they.  I think it's rare.  Well, Stump Brain's gonna find out.  I never looked at those things as racist.  No.  Believe it or not, I just, I just.  I'll start now.  Yeah.  Now.  Thank you.  Now I'll start looking at them as racist.  And find out where black balls, uh, came from.  So, Malik.  If that, it goes back to being, uh, some kind of racist thing, all right?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's, let's go with this.  So, Malik, do you know what I'm saying?  It's, it's not that I even disagree with the black, black bald or some of the things you're 
[00:41:30]  saying, but the black hole, it actually, it works.  Yeah.  And there are black sheep.  And they're rare.  So, I think.  And a black hole's not negative.  No.  Black hole's not a negative thing.  It just is what it is because light disappears.  Right.  Well, I agree with that.  As far as, uh, black hole, something that, you know, pulls in light and, and draws everything  into it.  It has, that, that, that's right in the connotation of saying it, but everything else, I think that  what they were, they were pushing a little bit too far and, and trying to, and trying  to group all these other things into it too. 
[00:42:00]  Not just like with the black hole, but you're completely right with that, Jim.  Yeah.  When you look into a hole, it's always shadowed and it's, it's just dark.  It's black.  It's not a, uh, you know, not every hole, not every hole.  Some holes are pink.  Good point.  And Malik, my brother, you do know they're all pink on the inside, right?  My, my brother.  I love them all.  White, brown.  Looks like a Wally.  White, brown.  Sir.  Why do we never see Malik?  How come you never come to New York and see us? 
[00:42:30]  Because he's going to scare a lot of people.  You guys never invited, you guys never invited me up.  I was up there one time for the, for the barrel, for the 20 barrel contest a long time  ago when you got the other station, but you guys never invited me back up.  Yeah.  That means you had a bad appearance.  Uh, I would like to have Malik in the studio.  We've been talking to Malik for a long time.  Yeah.  We'll get back to you, Malik.  All right.  Holla back, fellas.  Holla.  Holla.  Let's go to Phillip in New Mexico.  Phillip.  Hey, how's it going on?  Hey, little Jimmy.  Hey, buddy.  What up? 
[00:43:00]  How about Black Friday?  That's a good thing.  Day after Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  Or, or when a company is in the black.  I swear to God.  Instead of in the red.  I never looked at any of these, uh, uh, terms as racist.  So now we got to get to the bottom of all these black blank terms.  There's a scene in X, which is, it is kind of telling where they're going through the dictionary  in jail.  Yeah.  Uh, brother Baines, I think was the guy.  Brother Baines.  Brother Baines was the guy who I think was, was, was, uh, showing young Malcolm Little  the words in the dictionary. 
[00:43:30]  And, and you have to look up white and black.  Yeah.  And like all the subtle little terms about white being good, black being bad, not in terms  of evil and, and good.  Mm-hmm.  So I think that's where a lot of it comes from.  Uh, yes, Dunpray.  The, uh, term blackballing was, uh, traced back to Greece when you would vote against something  or someone by placing a black ball in the ballot box, signifying a negative vote.  So when you were against something, you blackballed it.  And so that's where the origin came from.  You would use a white ball for it and a black ball against it. 
[00:44:00]  So it was a no vote.  And, and, and how long ago was that?  That's, uh, ancient Greece.  We've had it around for a couple thousand years.  Wow.  Yeah.  So obviously, uh, it predates, uh, predates slavery in this country.  Oh, I thought you were going to say predates blanks because they were still blanks.  Jesus.  Oh, you lost.  Who's that?  Blanks because they were blank.  What was the other part?  I think I know what one of those was.  Uh, if it is what I think it is, I'd like to hug you. 
[00:44:30]  Uh, just a joke, people.  Relax.  Of course.  Let's say hi to Greg in DC.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, I wanted to thank Stunt Brain because I was about to explain what blackballing was,  but there's also in the black and in the red is a term for the type of ink they used to use  to write down whether people had enough money or less money.  When you had less than zero, they wrote your numbers in red ink.  And when you had more than zero dollars, they wrote it in black ink. 
[00:45:00]  Right.  Not racist.  All right.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Uh, here's one though.  Chuck in Bridgewater.  Chuck, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey guys, how you doing?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Uh, the game of chess.  White always moves first.  True.  But when was chess invented?  Yeah.  Jeez.  Chess has got to, dude, chess, they traced chess back to like the 1940s.  How old is chess?  It's an ancient game, I believe, that was actually developed in the Middle East. 
[00:45:30]  No way.  What?  I didn't say grease.  Um, he might be right.  He might be right.  I have an update on the black sheep issue too.  Yes.  Apparently white sheep wool was more valuable because it could be dyed many colors.  So darker sheep were not as valuable.  Oh.  The black sheep were looked down upon.  Okay.  But that's why white sheep were...  Yeah, that's why they say, oh, they're the black sheep.  They're different and they're not as great a value. 
[00:46:00]  Because you can't dye them.  All right, that makes sense.  So none of these things are racially based.  So basically what we're telling everyone today is that it's good to be white.  It certainly is.  Well, of course.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Greg, what's up?  Yeah, I'm on a crusade to equalize the black and white cookies.  There's less white than black.  I'm paying for a whole cookie.  I want at least half.  Can we all agree that the black and white cookie stinks? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Add to that joke about it.  We were paying for a whole joke and got none.  Yeah.  And thank you, Iraq.  He pulled up chests in India.  He started from India in the 6th century.  6th century.  All right.  That's a long time ago.  Yeah.  Hey, this black and white cookie thing's got me thinking.  There's a lot of desserts out there that we just got to put on the extinction list.  Like what?  Who's still eating black and white cookies?  You are, Travis?  What an all-day sucker. 
[00:47:00]  Delicious.  We got to retire some of these desserts.  If you got one, you give us a call after the break.  There's just nonsense out there still.  Yeah, that one.  That starts the list.  Black and white cookies.  I never enjoyed a black and white cookie ever.  No.  Ever.  Oh, yeah.  Well, here you go.  Here you go.  Norman, Mississippi.  Here you go.  Good morning, guys.  This is how we'll end the segment.  We'll make the other side feel very good right now.  Go ahead, Norm.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning. 
[00:47:30]  Thank you for keeping me awake on my trip home.  All right.  I just want to point out that in karate, what's the highest level of achievement?  Black belt.  Why don't I answer that?  There you go.  I want a quiz.  Yeah.  Eager Jim.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You didn't phrase that in the form of a question.  You didn't phrase it as a question.  What is a black belt?  So why isn't Whitey getting all up in arms about that?  Yeah.  Because we rule the world.  Oh, damn it.  Thank you, sir.  Phones are lit.  We got some great phone calls coming in.  So stay right there. 
[00:48:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  A lot of movies opening up today.  Opie and Anthony, by the way.  Excuse me.  You got Hellboy 2.  Yes.  86% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  Nice.  The only place to go for movie reviews, I'm thinking.  And then you got Meet Dave.  Eddie Murphy in Eddie Murphy.  Eddie Murphy's actually in his own body, right?  Yeah.  That's terrific.  Well, 22% positive reviews for that. 
[00:48:30]  And then Journey to the Center of the Earth.  63% positive reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  That looks pretty okay.  And then we got your dumb fact of the day.  Babe Ruth makes his Major League Baseball debut.  94 years ago today.  94.  Damn, that's a long time ago.  877-212-ON-A.  Can I say real quick? 
[00:49:00]  It's nice that Obama is treating Jesse Jackson's remark about cutting out his testicles a lot easier and softer and more graciously than, let's just say, he has treated other radio hosts.  Of course.  Racially sensitive jokes.  Yeah.  Meant to be funny.  Mm-hmm.  It's good.  Wait, what's that about?  Nothing.  I lost you there.  Oh, just how Obama's being more graceful and accepting the apology of Jesse Jackson, who, in secret, said that he wanted to cut his testicles out. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  Yeah.  But he was pretty outraged over the whole Imus thing.  Yeah.  We all remember that.  Just odd.  I just love making that comparison.  We live in a bizarre world.  Yeah.  It's a bizarre world.  I bet if that was a white gentleman that that slipped out and he said that.  Yeah.  What did Trent Lott say, that guy was in so much trouble?  I don't remember.  Was it even hateful or was it, Mike, do you remember?  I think it was.  Oh, more Mike.  Of course, Mike.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  It was at the retirement party of someone like Jesse Helms and he said, you know, the world would have been better if this guy had gotten elected president. 
[00:50:00]  Ah, right.  He was just saluting him.  Yeah.  And he had to retire.  Yeah.  For that.  He had to surrender his seat of power and retire.  It was horrible.  Over that.  Yeah.  Meant to be just, hey, you're a great guy thing.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Hey, I just got a.  Nice.  A lot of people have finished.  I just got a news update.  We're going to move on to other things, but I found this very interesting.  We got the Olympics right around the corner. 
[00:50:30]  In lovely China.  In lovely China.  China, who's taken over the world.  The Chinese are a-coming.  Mm-hmm.  I'm reading this.  It's a news story, so please don't dump out down the hall.  I beg of you.  Do not dump out down the hall.  This is a news story.  Dog meat has been struck from the menus of official Olympic restaurants.  And Beijing tourism officials are telling other outlets to discourage consumers from ordering dishes made from dogs. 
[00:51:00]  Really?  Instead, waiters and waitresses should patiently suggest other options to diners.  Why would they change the menu of the country?  Yeah.  Isn't part of having the Olympics in your country part of letting people see where they live?  Sharing in the culture?  Sure.  There you go.  Hmm.  So that's going on today.  That's nice. 
[00:51:30]  Why?  Because we think dogs are cute?  I mean, if they're eating over there, well, other animals are eating here.  It's silly.  Yeah.  Eat them.  Well, look at India.  They wouldn't touch a cow.  No.  We love cows.  Tasty.  Yeah, exactly.  Tasty, big, stupid animals.  You ever see Mississippi burning?  They say that when there's a fire, a cow won't even run.  He'll just stand there.  And burn.  Yeah, and you see he's just a charred cow with his teeth.  Cows are idiots. 
[00:52:00]  Nick C in Pittsburgh.  What do you think of Obama now, Opie?  Need more evidence why this idiot can't be president?  I don't give a crap who's president.  I like Obama over McCain, but in the end, I don't care.  We were watching a little McCain speech in the office this morning, and I just turned and  said, we're going to have a black president.  You said, we're so going to have a black president.  McCain, it's all about imagery, like Gene Simmons was saying yesterday, which we agree. 
[00:52:30]  He didn't teach us anything about that, but in this day and age, it's all about imagery.  And McCain just doesn't look presidential when he talks.  Yeah.  He's very monotone and very unsure of himself.  He looks old and frail.  Yeah.  Obama's going to be president.  Obama looks like a stronger towards the future guy.  Neither guy is for us and what we do for a living.  Yeah, I know Obama came out against Imus.  We know that. 
[00:53:00]  We talked about it.  But McCain's not going to be, yeah, shock jocks.  Let them live.  But McCain and Giuliani both said they'd go back on his show after he apologized.  Yeah.  McCain used to do Imus' show, right?  Back in the day?  Yep.  All right.  iPhones, you guys getting them?  I'm going to upgrade my phone.  I'm going to, you know, plug and get the upgrades.  But I'm not getting a new one yet.  I'm not getting a new one until I can text pictures. 
[00:53:30]  That's it.  My BlackBerry, I can text pictures all day long.  I know.  All day long.  Can you get pictures on your BlackBerry?  Because on a Verizon.  All day long.  I couldn't.  Send me a picture right now.  All day long.  I can't text them.  I have an iPhone.  You guys, you've got to stop.  The iPhone thing is, you know, come on.  Terrible.  They're all waiting out front of the Apple store.  Yeah.  I'm just annoyed.  I know they can do it.  Why don't they put it in the, why don't they put it on the phone?  They want to control you. 
[00:54:00]  Apple wants to control you.  Don't you have to, like, turn your phone on in the store now, too, and all that crap?  What's all that about?  Yeah, you have to go down there and turn it on because they're smart.  What happened is this iPhone now, the 16 gig price, used to be $4.99.  It's now $2.99.  What they're doing is they're making you sign up in the contract.  You'll actually wind up paying more for this new iPhone because I'm sure AT&T does a terrific job.  And here's the new features.  GPS capability.  I know where I am.  Yeah.  And whenever I travel, I never have a car or a driver. 
[00:54:30]  I always just walk with my phone.  You know, they really shouldn't brag about that because GPS is going to be in everything.  It's everywhere.  Doesn't BlackBerry have it, too?  Everyone has it.  Yeah, well, there's a primitive form of it right now for the BlackBerry.  3G network offers Internet speed several times faster than before, which in parentheses it says,  which they could have offered on the first phone.  I just put it in.  Yeah.  Users can surf the net while talking on the phone.  I don't know who will ever do that.  Why?  iTunes Apple Store offers a slew of programs and games. 
[00:55:00]  How about the game, Take Picture of Genitals, Send to Friends?  See, that's a game I'd like to play.  Slightly slimmer and lighter, which is good because a lot of times I've had to stop walking and put the iPhone down to get back a rest.  I was like, if this was only slightly slimmer and lighter and better audio, which I'm sure they couldn't.  I want to thank Apple for pushing the phone forward drastically, but I'm not buying into it. 
[00:55:30]  I'm going to stick with my BlackBerry.  There's going to be a new BlackBerry out in the fall, and that's the direction I'm going in.  Less battery life, too.  What?  And the new phone.  The Internet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do we got, Sam?  What do you know about this iPhone?  Well, I was going to say, too, as far as the new apps that you can put on and surfing the net while you're on your phone, you could do that.  If you have an iPhone now, you could just upgrade for free to the new software and do both those things on the current iPhone. 
[00:56:00]  So it's just the 3G and the GPS.  It's amazing.  You cannot.  So you still can't basically search on your phone.  You can't copy and paste anything.  You can't search your contacts.  Yes, you can search your contacts.  Now you can search your contacts.  But again, you can upgrade the software for free, and you can search your contacts that way.  You don't have to buy the new phone to do that.  So the only reason to buy the new phone is to get 3G and GPS.  What does GPS do?  I'm not sure.  Why would you need that? 
[00:56:30]  In case you get lost and you have your Google Maps, you can just click where am I now as opposed to having to type in the address.  That is cool.  I mean, the BlackBerry, you have to type in the address, and then it'll tell you how far you are.  I can kind of do that now, though.  Yeah, now it's exact.  I can kind of do that.  Now it's exact.  GPS is exact.  Wait, what do you mean you can do that now?  I can hit a little target, and it'll show me where I am.  On a map?  Yeah.  You can use, like, cell towers.  See, BlackBerry doesn't have that yet.  Oh.  It's pretty cool.  You put in an address and it gives you the map.  I have to put the address I'm in, and then I can figure out the places I'm trying to find. 
[00:57:00]  No, I just hit a button.  Oh, that's cool.  Tells you where you are.  Sounds like someone is soured on the BlackBerry.  No.  All right.  Speaking of the new iPhone, well, Sam, hit the streets again.  Ah.  Another segment of What's the Haps?  What's the Haps?  I see all these people lined up at the Apple Store, and I got to know, what's the Haps?  What's the Haps?  What's going on in my city?  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[00:57:30]  And I see that you ran into our pal Greg Packer.  Yeah, the guy who we talked to last year who was number one was, like, number 10 online this year.  Oh, ouch.  This is how dumb the local media is.  They don't realize that they're talking to the same guy every year.  Right.  Greg Packer, I brought this to everyone's attention years ago.  He's a guy that has figured out, like, his thing.  His thing is to be first for everything.  Mm-hmm.  And he's got, like, tons of footage of himself being first buying stuff. 
[00:58:00]  He probably doesn't even like the iPhone.  But he knows if he gets there a certain time, he'll be first online, and he knows everybody will interview him.  He'll talk to the news.  That's his thing.  We got to get him on the phone, because I do believe he was the guy that had breakfast or lunch with President Clinton back in the day,  because he figured out that he was going to McDonald's that day, and he sat at a table waiting for the president, basically, to show up.  Like, this is his thing.  Right.  And it's been his thing for a long time.  And I get so frustrated when the media talks to him like they've never seen this guy before. 
[00:58:30]  Sam interviewed Greg Packer.  All right.  All right, so we're here with Greg outside the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue.  Greg, you were the first online last year for the iPhone.  What's the haps this year?  This year, it took a little longer to build this lineup.  It's not really the same, but it's just good that everybody came out for iPhone 2.  How long have you been waiting online for?  This year or last year? 
[00:59:00]  This year.  This year?  Not really getting the second iPhone.  I just wanted to come out and, you know, show my love to everybody that came out for this iPhone.  See?  This is C?  So he's not even getting one.  No.  And mark my word, this guy will be all over TV today.  Jesus, he's not getting one, and he's online?  I asked him how long has he been waiting online, and he said, I'm not getting an iPhone.  He's in line.  A day and a half.  Yeah.  What's he doing?  He just likes it.  So you're not buying the phone?  I already got mine. 
[00:59:30]  So you're just waiting online?  I already got my, I can get an upgrade, so I don't need it.  Are you going to get an upgrade?  I'm definitely going to be getting the upgrade, yeah.  So you are getting the iPhone 2?  Not today, no.  So what are you doing online?  Just showing my love to everybody.  So like when they go on sale at 8 o'clock, the people behind you are just going to be  able to go in front of you because you're not going in?  When they go on sale at 8 o'clock, I'm going to walk in, you know, with them farmers that 
[01:00:00]  have been out here since July 4th.  And not buy an iPhone?  And not buy an iPhone.  But he will be interviewed by everyone.  Yeah.  I wonder how much he'd sell his spot in line for.  Some of those people are selling it for $250, I was watching this morning.  No way.  Yeah, that's what they were saying this morning.  So a week's worth of standing there to make $250 and you've been using a can as a toilet?  Yeah.  Almighty.  I'll give you $250 just to go home.  I know times are tough, but come on. 
[01:00:30]  So at the end of this, are you going to feel like it's worth it to have waited online for  24 hours to not get a phone?  I would think so, yeah.  You know, just to, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, great.  Well, have a good time.  I will.  God bless Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, he's a fan of the show, by the way.  He makes an appearance at FH every once in a while.  That's pretty nice.  Yeah, he's been around a while.  He just likes the festive atmosphere of waiting online and sitting on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Rob in Boston listening on BCN. 
[01:01:00]  Rob.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  The reason that Apple doesn't put texting pictures in the iPhone is because they assume  you're just going to email your pictures.  Yeah, but the thing is that's so, people do, that's what they say, but people MMS pictures  all the time.  Yeah.  It's almost like people text each other pictures.  We text a lot more than we email.  You don't have email conversations.  You have text conversations.  And then to go on, you have to get into your, so there was a, in a while it took like 15 minutes 
[01:01:30]  to upload, to get the email fixed, like, to, all right, I lost my train of thought.  Oh, boy.  No, that train of thought just smashed into a wall.  It really did.  I didn't lose it.  I saw it, and I hit a wall with it.  To email would not happen instantly, would it?  On the iPhone, would it take like 15 minutes?  Yes, sometimes it does.  Well, it takes a while.  Yeah, it's a couple of minutes.  Okay.  I was just having a discussion about this the other day.  Now, the BlackBerry, you got email, and I could send Anthony an email. 
[01:02:00]  He'll get it instantly.  Yeah.  So that's kind of like texting, which if I texted you, you would get it immediately.  And then they also have BlackBerry Messenger.  Like, those three things are pretty much the same thing.  They really are.  It used to be where, you know, the text messaging was a lot faster than receiving an email.  Here's the thing about text.  I know when I get a text, the second I get it.  Right.  I'm not constantly checking my email to see if I get a new email. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  And I don't have an alert that sounds – I have one, but I shut it off because it would  be going off every two seconds with every piece of crap mail that I get.  Right.  But a text, you know you're getting a text the second you get it.  All right.  Do you have iPhone Messenger?  No.  I don't know.  There is still.  There is no iPhone Messenger.  All right.  But BlackBerry has, you know, BlackBerry Messenger.  What is that?  It's pretty much texting.  Yeah.  It's pretty much texting.  They have an IM conversation, basically.  Don't they make money off emails in some way?  Like when you go somewhere – I think they're afraid nobody would use the email. 
[01:03:00]  Really?  If you could text pictures.  Like what would be the – I just don't understand why you'd want to go into your email, send  a photo, have someone get it, open it on there.  It's a pain in the ass.  I know.  Yeah.  Just text it.  And people have been complaining about it since the first one came out.  So there's no way that they still think people just email photos because everybody is displeased  with it.  Because viewmymessages.com is very difficult to get on.  I hate that effing thing. 
[01:03:30]  What is that?  You go to viewmymessages.com, put in a ridiculous password and username.  That's different every time.  And you get to see a postage stamp size picture that somebody sent you.  What?  And then what?  And you can't do anything with it.  You can't open it big.  You open it, but literally –  Where can you open it big?  On a computer or out of email.  You cannot just like look at it in your text.  And when you open it, it really is.  Who thought that was a good idea?  Oh, it's horrid.  No, what's their thinking?  They had to be thinking something. 
[01:04:00]  I don't know.  I wish I could tell you.  I don't know.  It drives me crazy.  That sounds ridiculous.  It doesn't make sense on any level.  But they had to think, well, we're doing this for this reason.  What's the reason?  Because no one would put up with that.  There's no advertising on the message site either.  No.  So they're not making money off of it.  No.  It's just –  It's a horrid little page.  It really is.  With nothing.  A little postage stamp picture.  And you can't get to it regularly.  Like you have to have a Wi-Fi connection for your phone to open view my message. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  And I went online and was reading it.  And a lot of phones have had that problem.  You can't just connect with a regular connection to view my message, although you can to other  web pages.  And the username is like just a random series of letters and numbers.  Oh, God.  And you can't copy and paste that out of your text.  So you have to be reading the text while you're inputting it.  Uh-huh.  Which is impossible, isn't it?  Yeah.  You'd have to do it on a computer or write it down and then –  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It sucks.  It's really a bad way of doing it. 
[01:05:00]  And I would love to know what the thinking behind it is.  I just don't understand it.  Yeah.  It's like – especially with Apple and video and stuff.  They're so good.  Yeah.  With stuff like video and their photo features.  They're so great at that.  I don't know why –  Yeah.  Put it in the phone.  All right.  We should take a break here.  We'll continue with this and other things.  Oh, by the way, we should mention that Greg Proops is coming in today.  Okay.  Very, very funny guy.  Loves to talk about politics.  Yeah.  But he also has some good stuff on pop culture.  I enjoy him, man. 
[01:05:30]  What time is he in?  Eight o'clock.  Okay.  And I believe Stephen Lynch is – is he here yet?  I think Lynch is coming by to say hi as well.  But first, we go to the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have nine new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I want to call and say,  F.U. to Crohn's disease for making me pull over on my daily commute  and F.U. my brains out to random public bathroom.  F.U. Crohn's disease.  Next message.  Hey, this is Jennifer from Long Island.

I'd like to give a big F.U. to my soon-to-be ex-wife  who dragged this out for a year and a half  where if you would have just done it my way in the first place,  you'd actually got more,  and now you're just holding out for the F.U. TV.  Take the mother F.U.  Next message.  I want to send a big F.U. to Lisa, my ex-girlfriend.  F.U. breaking up with me over my space. 
[01:06:30]  How dare you?  You're not even giving me a goddamn chance  to F.U. say what's on my mind.  Go F.U. yourself.  F.U. next message.  Uh, yeah, I'm just calling in to say  F.U. on the radio.  F.U. you.  Next message.  Yo, I want to give a big F.U. to anybody who's sober  because you know what?  That means you're not having fun.  F.U.  Next message.

[01:07:00]  Oh, my God, does my head hurt.  F.U.  Next message.  I want to give a big F.U. root canal  because I can't feel my f****** face or anything.  Goddamn it.  F*** you, root canal.  Next message.  I want to send a big F.U.  End of new messages.  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line  866-FU-LINE 1.  That's 866-FU-LINE 1.  Thank you, and goodbye. 
[01:07:30]  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  God damn it!  Fuck this show.  Take this fucking show and forget to get fucking, fucking fast.  Some great footage on TV right now.  Opie and Anthony, what do you got there, Jimmy?  No, no, I was wondering if we could, I was just trying to tell Sam or Mike,  maybe we can get this guy on the phone.  Which guy?  Commissioner John Price, this black guy who thought that certain languages are unacceptable.  I would love, well, why not?  Yeah, let's try to get him on.  I would love to hear his take on it.  Oh, that's the black hole thing we were talking about earlier? 
[01:08:00]  Sure.  It'd be interesting to hear his opinion.  Yes.  And Angel Food Cake, Devil Food Cake, or Devil's Food Cake.  Is that the gentleman in question?  Wow.  Yeah, that's the guy.  That's a guy?  He wears bow ties and of course he does.  What?  He wears bow ties.  Bow ties.  He's one of those black guys who wears the glasses and probably comes off.  He probably uses larger words than he needs to.  Tries to be an intellectual.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he probably is an intellectual, but he tries too hard to sound like one.  Yeah.  During the break we were watching some great footage on TV. 
[01:08:30]  What was that all about?  Foam kicking fire's ass.  That's what Jimmy was saying.  Tanker fire.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, yeah, they, uh, they got fuel, I guess, was running down the side of the road and  it's on fire.  So, uh, part of the fire hose that the firemen were using was on fire, but then they pulled  the foam truck up.  Holy Jesus.  When foam said, move out of the way, I got this handled.  Yeah, Jimmy was pointing out how foam kicks fire's ass. 
[01:09:00]  You silly water, you stay over there.  Yeah.  We're gonna take care of this one.  Enough with the water.  But they are spraying this foam on this tanker and, um, it is still just burning.  Oh, they got it over here still.  I wonder if the guy got out.  Wow, it looks like it's snowing.  I hope the guy isn't in there waiting for the foam to take effect.  Imagine if he was sitting in the middle of the fire and then just, like, helping spread  the foam with his hands.  Like, please, more foam up here in the cab.  There's a hell of a lot of foam being sprayed on this thing.  That's a hell of a money shot.  They're getting, yeah, it sure is. 
[01:09:30]  Where did they get that foam?  You can almost hear the truck yell, open up.  I think they're running out of foam, though.  It's just running out.  It's dribbling.  The guy's tapping the side of the truck.  Oh, boy.  They're like, look, now this guy's just spraying the lawn over there.  He's like, ah.  Ah, this grass looks a little dry.  There's nothing else I could do with my water.  A tanker on fire is a tough thing to put out.  I just got to wait for it to burn.  That's a bit scary.  All right, what's the haps?  That's what we were doing before the break.  Oh, that's what we were doing, right.  And Sam went out to the Apple store because everyone's going to pick up their second generation, 
[01:10:00]  right, iPhone?  Yeah, whatever.  What, are you disappointed in your iPhone?  Yeah, well, no, I like my iPhone.  And I'm just disappointed that this isn't the one where they have the ability to text  pictures and, you know.  And do certain other fun things.  They want you to get to third generation, so.  They know what they're doing over there at Apple.  They know how to get a lot of your money.  Nothing worse than having to go back and forth from an email to a phone contact to this and,  you know, because you can't copy and paste stuff. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  It's just a pain in the ass.  They're trying to make more moolah.  Whoa.  Oh, Jimmy.  A regular guy?  Who was that?  It was Norton.  Oh.  Being hip.  All right.  We meet Jeff, who's waiting for the new iPhone.  Let's say hi to Jeff here.  All right.  So we're here with Jeff outside the Apple store at the front of the line.  Jeff, what's the haps?  Can you pause us for a second?  You know, we're just.  Sure.  And can I say how badly, every time Sam throws his catchphrase in there, I want to put  a belt around his neck. 
[01:11:00]  Him with his what's the haps.  He asks people, and they kind of know what he means.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the haps?  It's obviously some kind of street term, right?  Yeah, it's like kind of, you know, you go around.  Because no one is saying, what?  You just go, what's the haps?  Did you make that up?  Actually.  There's no way you made that up.  That's a street term.  No, I was reminded.  You know where I learned that term?  Huh.  My father used it when I was a boy.  Really?  Yeah.  Or come home from school and be like, what's the haps?  Why won't you admit you're black?  Who cares? 
[01:11:30]  Your father would use that?  Yeah.  Your father would say, what's the haps?  What's the haps?  At dinner.  And you've got hair like that and other features that if I describe, I'll get fired.  And you still aren't willing to say that you may have some black blood in you.  Well, I have no...  Just say it.  Who cares?  Because there's no evidence of it.  I've never met a black, you know, family member.  All right.  Let's go back to the theft.  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  Uh, you know, we're just waiting for it to be released.  Haven't slept yet, but I tried a little. 
[01:12:00]  Didn't work.  What are you guys waiting for?  The iPhone 3G.  Uh, how long have you been here for?  Uh, I got here about 11.30 yesterday morning.  What kind of phone do you have now?  Um, this Verizon Swivel thing that plays TV and stuff.  It's pretty cool, but not an iPhone.  The iPhone doesn't play TV.  No, but it has good internet and mobile applications.  Say good MMA?  No.  I think it said Immermet.  Immermet.  It's got the Immermet and some good apps. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  So now what's the app?  Just repeating what people tell you.  Yeah.  We don't really know what that means.  No.  Your father would say that to you?  Yeah, like I come home from school.  Well, he'd come home from work.  Yeah.  Because I was like 6.30 and he'd be like, hey.  Well, obviously he was white.  Well, he'd say, hey, what's the haps?  I'm not going to say anything.  What's happening?  War from death.  I'm just saying the way he looks, obviously.  He's very fair-skinned.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  The iPhone also can't copy and paste.  Do you have a problem with that?  Some people online have a problem with it.  No, because I don't know many phones that can't copy and paste.  What about like sending picture texts?  You don't know many phones that copy?  What is this guy talking about?  He's crazy.  He's just, a lot of people who just love the iPhone so much on that line.  Yeah.  Just decide to ignore any possible flaws.  All right, wait a minute.  You guys can't copy and paste with your iPhones?  No.  No.  No.  What?  There's no copy and paste.  What you do is, if you want, like if you say you want to go get a picture, you get the 
[01:13:30]  ID and then you copy it down on paper.  Right.  And you paste that up on your computer.  Right.  Right.  And then you use your keyboard and go online and get it.  What are they doing?  You literally need a pen and paper.  Wait, let's say I go, Jimmy, you know, here's a phone number for whatever.  And I send it off to you.  You can't just copy.  No, it will underline.  You can, yes, you can there.  But like.  You can't copy.  Like you'd have to push it.  It's just for the phone.  Like it recognizes that it is a phone number because it's however many digits. 
[01:14:00]  And then you can put it in your phone book.  But you can't, like, like if you said here, Google this, and it's some obscure name, you'd  have to write down the name, go into Google, type it in.  Hey, Gregorio, can you, can you MMS a photo?  Yes.  Do this.  Take a picture right now and MMS it to me and I'll show you what comes up.  Oh, this is going to take a while?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  He's doing exactly, unbuckling the belt.  You think I didn't know where this was headed?  You said take a picture. 
[01:14:30]  Atta boy.  I want a bag shot, kid.  All right.  There's the pic.  All right.  And now what do I do?  Just however you'd MMS it to me.  However you would text it to me.  Oh.  MMS.  Is that what it is?  Why are you saying it like that?  Because I'm smart.  You're right.  I hate when people say that, though.  But I like saying MMS because it reminds me of multiple sclerosis, but a lot of it.  I can, like, email it to you.  Is that good?  No.  Oh.  I could, uh...  Can you text it to me?  Yeah, I can. 
[01:15:00]  I just don't know how.  Uh-oh.  Can Danny...  I actually usually just email him.  Danny...  No, no.  It's got to be text.  That's the only thing.  All right.  Text?  Okay.  Maybe Danny can come in and help us because he knows...  Danny knows everything about phones.  All right.  Well, now we're wasting time.  All right.  We'll get that done.  Hold on.  Here's more Jeff.  Copy and face.  What about, like, sending picture text messages?  Uh, that is one thing I wish I could do along with having flash.  But, um...  I mean, in comparison to other things, not many other phones have flash. 
[01:15:30]  He just ignores the picture messaging and goes straight to flash.  Flash.  Is it...  I mean, uh, you know, I brag about the BlackBerry.  Is the iPhone the best phone out there?  What is the best phone out there?  I don't know.  Right now?  I don't think you can say.  I think, uh...  If you could take all the features from every phone and put it in one phone...  That would be the best phone out there.  That would be the best phone.  I love texting on the iPhone.  It took a while for me to like it.  People are like, but you can't feel it.  But I can move pretty quick on this.  Yeah.  Uh, I just can't do it in drive.  But it works fairly well. 
[01:16:00]  The texting, when you get used to it, I love.  Oh, yeah.  So, uh...  The internet's good on it.  Once you can get service.  If you're on...  If you have great Wi-Fi coverage at the moment, the internet's fantastic.  Amazing, right?  All right.  Let's go to Jo.  She's a girl from Connecticut.  She has a story to tell Anthony for some reason.  Jo, what's up?  Hi, guys.  First, I want to say I love you.  My whole family listens to you every day.  Jimmy, I think you're brilliant.  Oh, thank you.  There's a special place in my heart for you.  Thank you.  Especially since I heard you make a Paul and Carla reference. 
[01:16:30]  Of course.  Always.  Okay.  Now, I'm the person that called a couple months ago that played with mercury and asbestos.  I don't know if you remember.  Uh, no.  Okay.  I do kind of remember that.  Okay?  Okay.  All right.  When I was eight, we moved from one house to another.  Um, and one day we were bringing our cat to the new house in a pickup truck.  It was my brother, my father, and myself.  And the cat didn't like being in the car, so my father devised some kind of contraption  to bring it. 
[01:17:00]  It was maybe 15 minutes away, the new house.  So, he did something with the cat in the bed of the pickup truck.  So, we pulled up to the new house.  We're all excited.  Get out of the car.  We see my cat strangled, hung over the side of the truck.  My father tied a rope to its collar, and on the way, it jumped over the side and hung  itself.  Jeez.  Was it well hung?  Of course it did.  Don't you think that's terrible?  Boo.  Boo!  Yeah, it is sad. 
[01:17:30]  I love kittens.  Yeah, that would be a tough thing to see.  What a dummy.  Of course the cat's going to jump.  I wasn't that upset for some reason.  I don't know why, but...  Because you see the humor in it like we do.  By the way, Opie, here it is.  Yeah.  This is what you get.  Now, Travis sent me a photo.  Thank you, Joe.  Here you go.  Thanks.  Bye.  All right.  Someone's saying the bestie phone is the Tricorder.  Take a look at that.  That's what I get.  The Tricorder.  What does this mean?  That means I have just been texted a photo. 
[01:18:00]  So, now what do I do?  You'd have to go on a computer and go get it.  No, you just click viewmymessage.com, right?  Go ahead.  Give it a click-a-roo.  Yeah.  How do I click?  Nothing will happen.  It just disappeared, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Now, it's at viewmymessage.com.  Now, what do I do?  Let me see.  Is it open?  Hold on.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, I think.  What's happening right now?  You see here, look.  You see how it says loading right there?  Yeah.  It'll never load.  Watch.  It will come back and say server's not responding.  So, then what do you do?  You have to find a computer?  You have to find a computer. 
[01:18:30]  You have to carry a computer in your pocket.  There you go.  I'm not ready for an iPhone.  Simple as that.  But watch.  I'm not ready.  It's loading viewmymessage.com.  Yep.  And then it will say, I predicted this, it will say server has stopped responding.  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  Hey, I don't know.  Because it stinks stupid on why they do that.  I don't know either.  And I don't know why that you can't get it from your phone.  Yeah.  Why can't they fix that?  Malik knows what the hottest phone is out there.  Malik, calling back from Asbury Park. 
[01:19:00]  Malik.  Yeah.  Hey, yo.  The hot phone is the LG Dare.  If you go to YouTube and check it out, you'll see that it does everything.  The iPhone can't compete with it.  Plus, the Samsung Instinct is beating out the iPhone, too.  The iPhone is garbage.  What is the one you're talking about?  It's the LG Dare.  And I think the reason Malik is saying this is because he might have gotten a few boxes off a truck somewhere.  Malik, what service is it? 
[01:19:30]  They're with Verizon.  But as far as, like, the phone, I believe, yeah, LG makes it.  But that phone does everything.  You don't have to go through, like, your email to send pictures.  You can go right through your text.  It already comes with a higher version of Google Maps, which is a navigation system.  This phone does everything.  YouTube and it, check it out.  It's a hot phone.  That one and the Samsung Instinct.  All right.  Malik, just so you had to tell, Safari could not open the page because the server stopped responding. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  So I cannot view my message now.  Hey, can we do polls on onaradio.com yet?  No, but we'll be able to soon.  Well, because now everyone's calling up with what they think is the best phone out there.  Now we're getting Nokia N95.  Maybe we could do some kind of poll somewhere and find out what the people out there are saying the best phone is.  Oh, is the LG a touchscreen?  Yeah, it is.  Look at it.  If it's a touchscreen, it doesn't have any buttons because everything is touchscreen.  Huh.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  All right.  Excuse me.  All right.  Excuse me.  It looks like an iPhone knockoff.  It looks very iPhone-ish.  Yeah.  But if it's got fun things like, you know, the ability to text pictures and have video.  I have a little BlackBerry.  Maybe I'll sell my mini BlackBerry and then try.  What's the text look like on this?  Because maybe I'll sell my mini BlackBerry because I have a Verizon account too for emergencies  where I need to make a call from my apartment because I can't get reception.  My apartment's in this really, really weird location on the west side of Manhattan.  So I might, which is just really out of the way and nobody goes there. 
[01:21:00]  There's mountains and stuff in the way.  Maybe I'll get that one and try it and make a comparison.  Yeah.  I don't understand why you can't use cell phones in buildings in New York City.  Amazing.  Because I had to get a landline.  Yeah.  I haven't had a landline in, damn, I don't know, 10 years.  I think it's healthier, though.  Healthier.  Hey, O.  Yeah.  Hey, O, listen.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm doing an intro song for you guys' show.  Where do I send it to?  Right on.  Send it to garbage.com. 
[01:21:30]  Wait, where does it go, Sam?  Who, Danny, maybe?  Any of us, yeah.  Any of us.  So, all right, send it to Sam.  Sam at websiteyoucansaid.com.  Where's the Opie and Anthony account?  What Opie and Anthony account?  Wait, where does Malik send the song that he wants us to play there, Stunt Brain?  You want to mail it or email it?  Email it.  No, I'm going to email you.  You guys need some hip-hop flavor to you, so I'm trying to give you that street credit.  You know what I mean?  Holler.  Holler.  Oh, my God. 
[01:22:00]  Holler.  And send it to StuntBrain at AOL.com.  Oh, boy.  Look down.  Look down.  You have no idea what you just did.  You already did it.  You did it the first day you guys attacked the website.  Oh, boy.  You have no idea what you just did.  It's StuntBrain at AOL.com there, Malik.  All right, fellas.  All right.  A few people saying that the Nokia N95 is the best phone out there.  Where's the email accounts that we were supposed to be able to stay on the air?  No, my email account starts with an F.  But why is that still happening?  We're supposed to get that fixed so we can stay on the air.  Hmm? 
[01:22:30]  Well, why would anyone try to help us around here?  All right.  Why don't we say hi to Henry?  Henry is a douche.  Yes, that's what Sam wrote as we continue.  What's the Haps?  As people wait online for their new iPhones.  Here's Henry.  All right.  So we're here with Henry outside the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue.  Henry, what's the Haps?  I have no idea what that means.  It's like what's happening.  Like, Haps is like an abbreviation for...  I've been sitting here about eight hours and waiting for the iPhone. 
[01:23:00]  Do you have a current iPhone?  I do.  I have the first generation iPhone.  What's making you decide to switch to the iPhone 3G?  The new one's shinier and Steve Jobs held one.  Hmm.  He was trying to be funny.  Yeah.  Can I say I'm looking at this thing that Malik described?  Yeah.  And, uh...  You like it, Jimmy?  Judging by the YouTube thing, I will say it is impressive.  Yeah.  It is a ripoff of the iPhone, but so what?  Well, they're all doing the ripoff thing. 
[01:23:30]  You can't make a...  This is the problem with today's technology, and this is where it's like Apple should have  thought this through a little better, because it's like you come up with such a...  It is a brilliant piece of technology.  Yeah.  The iPhone is a masterpiece.  And they thought they could control it, but everyone else, all these other companies  grabbed the iPhone, took it apart, and said, wow, we'll make our own version that's better  than what they're doing.  We'll take our generation and make...  Right?  Yes, exactly.  Honey!  Anthony has to go doo-doos!  Anthony's been in and out of the past today.  Oh, my God!  Yeah, go in there and make sure he's okay, Jimmy, will ya? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, get him, Mike.  Make sure he's okay there, Jimmy.  Jimmy's pounding on the door.  Can you hear anything in there, Jimmy?  What do you hear, Jimmy?  I can't tell.  It sounds like there's possibly a stew being dumped.  Poor Anthony.  Anthony had to make a poop.  The poor boy has an upset tummy. 
[01:24:30]  He sure does.  All right.  Anthony doesn't like people listening at the door while he's on the turlet.  A bunch of people saying this Henry douche sounds a lot like Flea Man, so a few people out there  are enjoying that.  And Flea Man's a douche, too.  Well, there you go.  Here's more of Henry.  So you agree with people saying it might be a little silly for people to wait online for  a phone that's just a little faster than the one that you already have?  Not only that, but the last phone had absolutely no problem staying in stock, especially not  at the Apple stores.  I could probably come here tomorrow and have no problem. 
[01:25:00]  How come iPhones can't send picture text messages?  Because Steve Jobs doesn't like them.  What about, does he copy and paste ever?  Steve Jobs has no need.  He remembers everything perfectly and types it in faster than you can type control V.  Do you think Steve Jobs could make a phone that I could use, too, not just him?  Steve Jobs could make a phone so heavy he himself cannot lift it.  Oh, my glad he tripped on that one.  That's a heavy phone.  He is a heavy man. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, you're right, Sam.  This guy is a douche.  He's a complete douche.  He's failing miserably with his humor there, his Steve Jobs humor.  But, Jimmy, you make a great point.  I think iPhone really thought they were going to take over the whole cell phone business,  and people said, screw that.  This is what happens, because this is what's been going on in satellite radio, too.  One company gets a really cool unit, and the other company takes it and rips it apart  and goes, oh, I see what they're doing here, and they quickly make their own version.  So what happens is there's so many Verizon users, because they have a weird – my ex-brother-in-law 
[01:26:00]  used to work for them.  The reason their service is so good is because they use a different technology than the other  companies do.  Right.  Oh, so Verizon people don't want to leave Verizon.  Right.  So if Verizon comes up with something comparable, they're all going to stay, and it's like  you could have taken so many of them.  Sure.  By having this thing do everything that the BlackBerry could possibly do and more.  Right.  That's what they should have done, because –  They were holding back some of this technology.  Yeah.  Because they wanted to get a bunch of generations out there. 
[01:26:30]  And obviously, the iPhone's selling very, very well.  Millions of – I mean, it might even be – a stunt brand?  Is that better than they expected?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it is.  But, you know, part of this, you have to remember, ties into the whole iTunes thing,  because it was about getting a device that would give them phone business while keeping  them ahead in the music and video business, and this accomplished it.  Can these other phones work with iTunes the way the iPhone does?  I'm in.  I'm not shifting.  I like the iPhone.  I think I'm going to jump in, despite everybody else here seeming to win. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, you haven't gotten one yet?  Seven minutes.  No, I mean the upgrade.  I've gotten one, but I'm upgrading as soon as the show's over.  Oh, you can upgrade today.  Yeah.  No, the music thing, I don't know what – I don't use the – I don't use the music  on my phone because the – I have little ears, and I don't want any little ear jokes.  I can't handle them.  It hurts.  I have teeny little ear holes.  You really do have strange ears.  I'm a small-eared boy.  Although that one's popping out because you've got the headphones behind it, propping it  up a bit.  That's why I do that.  It makes it look like this guy's got big, virile ears. 
[01:27:30]  You're lucky, though.  You've got the small ear, but you know what happens?  They continue to grow your entire life.  So by the time you're older, you're not going to have those big, ridiculous ears, Jimmy.  That's true, but I'll still have the same fetus ear holes.  So what happens is I cannot use earbuds.  They kill me.  And the ones that the iPhone or iPods give you, I can't use.  Well, you've got to get the custom ones because they give you all different earbud pieces.  Yes.  They change so they can fit your ear hole.  The headphone jack on the new iPhones work with all headphones. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, okay, because the original headphone jack that came with my original iPhone, I couldn't  put any headphones in because the length of it was purposely built so you could only use  theirs or you have to buy an extension.  Right.  So that made it very difficult.  All right.  Before we move on, because we've got Stephen Lynch here.  Greg Proops is going to be here any moment.  We've got to get Daniel on the radio because this guy is insane.  They're the guys that were there, like five of them, since the 4th of July, trying to raise 
[01:28:30]  awareness for their cause and buy some phones.  So what?  He thought this was a great opportunity to get his cause out there?  Yeah.  He's not about the iPhone, but he figured if I'm online, the media is going to ask me about  the iPhone and I could flip it and talk about what I want.  Well, they want to put a farm on the lawn of the White House.  And so they figured they'd spread the message by setting some kind of Guinness World Record  for waiting online for a week.  Right.  And then buying iPhones.  All right.  Here we go.  This is Daniel. 
[01:29:00]  Sir, here with Daniel outside the Apple store, 5th Avenue.  Daniel, what's the haps?  I'm first in line for the new iPhone, I'm told.  And I've been here since 4th of July.  It's July 11th, 7-11, Slurpee Day.  And we're going to slurp on in there.  I'm going to get a phone for...  Is there something...  Is that a real thing?  Slurpee Day?  Look up Slurpee Day.  No, I'll tell you what that is.  He was making a 7-11 joke.  No, I think they're giving free Slurpees today at 7-11.  Because it's 7-11.  So it really...  Oh, so why not take advantage of the whole 9-11 thing? 
[01:29:30]  Well...  Why not?  But yeah, so they're...  You know damn well, if you know a little bit about...  They probably would rather give the Slurpees away on 9-11, if you know what I'm saying.  Can you imagine if they had attacked on July 11th?  The damage they would have done to that business.  Right.  Oh, 7-11.  You know, they'll be quick check people.  I have a feeling they would love to give free Slurpees on 9-11, too.  I don't disagree with you.  That's all I can say about that. 
[01:30:00]  Well, the special interest groups will come after you.  Yeah, give you a whole bunch of malarkey.  All right, here's more Daniel.  And we're going to slurp on in there.  I'm going to get a phone for myself.  And, you know, we've been waiting for Apples.com  because we believe that our next president of the United States  should have an organic farm on the lawn of the White House.  So I'm going to buy a phone, too.  You know, the Who Farm is going to buy a phone for Barack Obama.  And the Who Farm is going to buy a phone for John McCain this morning. 
[01:30:30]  Don't you think they already have phones?  They don't have an iPhone.  And we need our next president to be someone who can think different.  So he's wasting his time on this line  because he wants people to know that there needs to be a farm  on the White House lawn.  And he's going to buy telephones for the presidential candidates.  And try to hand them to the presidential candidates?  Maybe send them through the mail.  Yeah, wonderful.  More of Daniel.  How come there should be a farm at the White House?  Because we need to have a place where children can come 
[01:31:00]  have hands-on science education at the seat of power.  We need a president who can eat right and think straight.  We need to be able to be using that house  that everybody in America, you know, owns.  This land is our land.  We need that land to be used productively  to feed the nation's poorest in the capital city.  So the bounty from that 17-acre land could go right into feeding, you know,  the poorest in the food pantries.  Look, I respect people that have a cause for the most part. 
[01:31:30]  But, you know, what are you doing?  It's probably the worst cause I've ever heard in my life.  Is that the worst cause ever there, Jimmy?  Yeah.  A farm on the White House lawn?  I, I, I, I, that and Nambla.  You'd have to go to a photo finish.  And the Who Farm's going to make that a reality starting today.  We're launching our summer tour, too.  We're going to Lollapalooza.  The Who Farm is going to be at, you know, 
[01:32:00]  a lot of the festivals over the summer.  So you've got to watch out for the Who Farm.  What's the one, what's the one where Radiohead and all those  are playing on Liberty?  So, so you guys are like buying iPhones  and going to concerts to raise awareness?  Absolutely.  That's what the Who Farm does.  That rules.  Thanks a lot, man.  I've got to shave.  What if we just, like, you can shave while we're doing this.  They're, they're trying to make a difference  by going to cool concerts and buying new technology. 
[01:32:30]  What is the Who Farm, though?  It's organic.  White House.  Oh, I don't know what the O stands for.  Oh, White House Organic Farm.  And they want to put a farm.  Wouldn't that be who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who.  How do you say WHO?  WHO.  Yeah, the Who Farm.  The White House Organic Farm Project.  That's what Who Farm stands for.  Well, then why wouldn't it be the Woff? 
[01:33:00]  It's the Woff.  Project messes up the whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And plus it has the, so it's the Woff.  The Woff.  It's a very comfortable thing to say.  This is something, this is something the Whig should have taken care of back in the day.  You know, it's 2008.  We don't need farms on the White House lawn.  There's other things to worry about.  A stupid Iran is firing missiles.  Okay.  I don't think they're going to worry about, you know, having corn and cucumbers on the White House lawn. 
[01:33:30]  Can I tell you what a coward I am yesterday while we were interviewing Gene Simmons?  Anthony said, are you a Republican or a Democrat?  And if I had an ounce of courage, what I wanted to say was he's a member of the Whig Party.  Oh.  I didn't.  I sat on the joke and I just thought of it when you said that.  But you got to share a banana with Gene Simmons.  I did, but that was wonderful.  That was my cowardice.  The treat.  Yeah.  All right.  One more from Daniel talking about this who farm.  What if we just opened a farm near the White House?  It wouldn't be the same, man.  You know, this country got started. 
[01:34:00]  Everybody was a farmer.  Everybody ate from their front yard, backyard.  We need to prove to, you know.  Also shot Indians.  Yes, and slaves prepared the food.  This guy's talking about the good old days.  It's waxing fantastic.  Everyone ate in their plantations.  Yeah.  We need to prove to, you know, the world that, you know, farming is a cool thing to do.  Farming is in.  Eating your own food is cool.  You know, the kitchen gardener doesn't have to go far to get the produce. 
[01:34:30]  What if we put, like, a stop-and-shop next to the White House with a huge produce section?  Huh.  You'd have to get that through Homeland Security.  I guess that's true, too.  Well, uh...  Yeah, but that's easier than getting a farm on the White House lawn, you dope.  Your idea stinks.  You should have told him his idea stinks.  I think the beauty of Sam is just suggesting other things.  I like keeping him talking.  Yeah.  I think Sam's idea is of logic. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Juxtapose with this one's illogical behavior.  That through Homeland Security.  I guess that's true, too.  Well, uh...  Good luck getting your iPhone and going to your concerts and raising awareness.  Well, God bless America and God bless the Who Farm.  Yeah.  Who Farm.  Yeah.  Doesn't exist.  Yeah.  No Who Farm.  There's no...  There's no Who Farm.  There is no Who Farm.  The Whop Farm.  The Whop.  The Whop.  This 7-Eleven thing pisses me off, by the way.  Why?  It says July 11th, 7-Eleven, is the day that 7-Eleven celebrates its birthday. 
[01:35:30]  That's not true.  No.  It says thank you to its customers with free Slurpee drinks at participating stores.  This year's 7-Eleven day marks the company's 81st birthday.  Is this true?  Or did they come up with all this crap after 9-Eleven?  That's probably true.  I'm guessing.  Customers can pour their favorite Slurpee flavor in colorful 7.11 ounce birthday cups  throughout the day while cups supplies last.  7-Eleven originally celebrated its birthday on July 11th because the guy who started it, 
[01:36:00]  his son's birthday, was July 11th.  You're such a liar.  You're lying.  I know, because I smiled when I said it.  Yes.  I just realized I'm lying.  You couldn't keep...  I couldn't keep a straight face.  I couldn't keep a straight face.  I just wanted someone to go, really?  And I was going to go, no.  We never got to that part because you were smiling.  I know.  I'm smirking ass.  I forgot I'm not in a phone conversation.  You would be horrible at Hold'em.  I am.  I'm terrible.  You would be horrible.  I always do. 
[01:36:30]  I have a tell.  It's like when I get a good one, I go, yes.  I've got a great hand.  Yeah.  Greg Proop, Stephen Lynch, next.  Stay there.  What's up, Joanne?  This Jimmy guy, he's useless.  No one cares about that.  That's very nice.  Be a little more effective if a man called in.  Dumb broad.  Dumb broad.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The man's talking.  Being abroad, we take your opinion a little less seriously.  Dumb broad.  And right now, hold on.  The man is talking.  Dumb broad.  Dumb broad.  That smells.  The bottom line is you should be on your knees scrubbing a toilet and laughing at what the 
[01:37:00]  men said.  Opie and Anthony.  Checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Getting very busy in the studio today.  We got to my right, Greg Proops.  Good morning, everyone.  Who's going to be at comics starting tonight?  Yes, sir.  I would assume Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  No Sunday.  No Sunday.  So Friday and Saturday, comics, which is a good club, man.  We've been doing a lot of stuff with comics the last, I don't know, six or eight months  or so.  It's in the Meatpacking District.  It's on like 14th and 9th. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, aesthetically, it's a beautiful room.  It's a nice place.  I ain't been in yet, but I'm very much looking forward to it tonight.  It's a good room.  It really is.  They have it set up pretty nice.  So make sure you check out Greg Proops if you're looking for something to do this weekend.  And then you got Steven Lynch on the couch just being cash.  Cash.  Look at him.  Just kind of like lounging with his buddy, I think Joe, right?  Joe Berg.  Joe Berg, sure.  And where are you going to be, Lynch?  House of Blues in Atlantic City tomorrow.  Nice.  A couple shows.  Very good. 
[01:38:00]  You have two shows tomorrow night.  Are they sold?  Because they will be if they're not now.  No.  Okay.  That's why he's here, Jimmy.  Come on.  Well, one might be sold sometimes.  You're trying to just push a late show.  We all like to act like we're friends, but come on.  We've got to get some tickets sold for Lynch.  You know shows go last minute because people don't know if they're going to go down or not.  That's true.  Yeah, last minute.  But now you're getting the word out there that if you're heading that way, you're going  to be performing.  I don't think there's any tickets left for my show tonight, Jim.  Really? 
[01:38:30]  Really?  Yeah, there's probably two or three left in the back.  Yeah, that's why Greg's here today.  Just to hang and say hi to us, right?  I just wanted to roll in, man.  I love Midtown.  Yeah.  So many times I've gone on the road, I got eight tickets sold, and I'll be like, they  might have a few left if you want to call.  Right.  And then you get down to the station, and they go, we have 45 free tickets today.  Jim, how do you want to give those away?  It's the worst.  Yeah.  The first 3,000 callers.  Right.  Just throw them out the window as I leave.  And Kenny's the worst, too, because I'd be like, we only got 80 tickets sold. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  He never comes in with gentle news.  Yeah.  Right.  We're screwed for tonight.  We got to send him to school or something.  He doesn't know how to do stuff.  But he does tell the truth.  I mean...  He means well, but it's just awful.  It's just awful.  You know.  We know.  We know.  It's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  Are you following this Jesse Jackson thing?  Oh, the last I heard was he wanted to cut his things off.  Sure.  That was the last thing I heard.  And that was...  But I don't know.  Has there been further movement since then? 
[01:39:30]  He wants to cut other things off?  Pancreas?  Internal organs?  Isle of Langerhans?  Uvula?  No.  It's just...  It's kind of just going away.  Pituitary gland?  Yeah.  Nothing.  He was forgiven.  Of course.  Well, as you do.  That was it.  Yes.  Yes, you must forgive.  That's to forgive those who are in good with the Lord, right?  Because you never know when they might send a weird telegram to them.  Yeah.  True.  As long as it's...  It's a melanin thing.  If you're black, you can say what you want and not be completely criticized by the white 
[01:40:00]  media.  If you're white, they're going to crucify you for it.  Well, you see, because you're racist if you criticize them.  Yeah.  Which you are, Jim.  And I think you just proved it just now.  Absolutely.  I only crucified me.  By even raising the issue.  No, it's already gone away?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  This is an election year.  There's going to be something else.  You know, two seconds later, it'll be Obama, you know, had a clinic where he hated white  people every Saturday morning or something.  Yeah.  That'll carry on.  I would assume you're going to vote for Obama, huh?  I'm kind of forced into a corner on it.  He wasn't my first choice.  Who?  I'm not a big Obama person, so... 
[01:40:30]  Who was your first choice?  I was more of a Hillary person.  Okay.  Because she had a bigger member than everybody else.  Giant, lethal, biblical, terrible, swift female member dripping with venom.  Huge carapace around it.  And that's why they were frightened of her.  Now, you do follow...  Obama's, you know, he's...  You do follow politics, though.  I do follow politics, yes.  Do you think it's going to be Obama?  Do you think this country's ready for this?  I don't know.  We'll see.  No, I mean...  You're talking about a candidate who carried Wisconsin and North Carolina in the primaries, 
[01:41:00]  so watch out, America.  I believe Hillary carried, what was it, New York, California, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas?  Yeah.  Did you do Pennsylvania, too?  Pennsylvania.  That's without even Michigan and Florida, so...  Right.  You tell me how the candidate got picked.  Weren't two of those states, though?  Two of those states, though?  Wasn't Obama not on the ballot?  No, it was Michigan and Florida.  I didn't count those.  I'm only counting the ones where he was on the ballot.  Massachusetts, where he had all those wonderful endorsements, and he didn't carry that state either.  No, not at all.  I think it's going to be a dogfight, frankly.  But McCain just doesn't look presidential. 
[01:41:30]  The captain of the Mayflower?  He's going to get there.  He's all right.  He's got his little tri-cornered hat and his telescope.  Apparently, the British are a hassle.  I love watching him turn, because you know how most people are able to, like...  You can't see it on the radio, but I'm turning my head from the right to the left to address different people in the room.  McCain does the full-body turn, where, like, there's no...  I don't have a neck.  I'm only able to turn on the axis of my body.  Oh, yeah.  So he kind of wiggles from one side to the other, like this. 
[01:42:00]  He has a neck, but I think it's full of tumors, so he can't really move it from side to side at this point.  The tumors are the fact that his spine was fused with the butt of a rifle.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He's as spry as a woodland creature, and that gives me confidence.  Just to see him gamble about like a young deer in the morning dew.  And he's full of ideas.  What is he?  He doesn't know about the economy.  He doesn't know about, I don't know, government, stuff like that.  This is a guy who's been in the Senate for about 450 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, McCain was...  We were seeing some footage of him on TV today, and I think it was Stump Ringo's. 
[01:42:30]  What is going on with McCain?  Is he storing nuts for the winter?  That's where Hillary got him with her stinger.  They were drinking in Afghanistan, and she puffed him up on that side, man.  Yeah, he does.  He's always getting something cut off of him, too.  Oh, yeah.  He's got Band-Aids on his head.  What I love, too, is he said he's not even getting, like, re-election he's kind of scared  of, because he'll be, like, 100 at that point.  Right.  So we're talking about a president who's basically got one term, and then, like, I'm going to  go home now.  I don't feel good.  And he looks like the president's look after they're done with the time. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  He's like Lincoln in 1865.  You're not supposed to go in looking like you've already done four or eight years of this  stressful job.  You've all seen the bizarre before-and-after pictures of everybody.  Like, even Jimmy Carter, Lincoln, whatever, they come in all fresh-faced and spry, like  Howdy Doody, and when they leave, they're like Dorian Gray.  Wait, they got an old picture of Lincoln after he did his time?  Yeah, there's a picture of him.  After he did his time?  In 1860.  Oh, what am I talking about?  And there's a picture of him.  Yeah, they got a picture of him, all right?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a picture of him right toward the end.  After he saw who moved in next door. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  I'm just saying.  I knew I shouldn't have left Frederick Douglass in the White House.  But there's a drastic difference before the assassination, obviously, where Lincoln...  Yeah, he looks like he's a bi-fi.  Yes, and after.  He's at least in the second one.  Yeah, yeah.  After the assassination...  A big stovepipe hat.  The pictures are shocking after the assassination.  No, before, he looks like he's about 250 years old.  Okay.  But there's the president who, unlike our current president, stayed up all night, every  night of the war, worrying about what was going on in the war.  Are you trying to say that Bush is getting a lot of good night sleeps? 
[01:44:00]  More vacation days than any president in the history of the office?  Which I think is an exciting accomplishment.  As Reagan said, hard work never killed anyone, but why take a chance?  He, uh...  I think it's...  When you have a president like him, you pretty much want him to take days off.  Pretty much.  Just go...  Go vacation for a while.  Let other people...  He's bound to say something clever if you let him talk, and that's the problem.  What was it last week?  There's a magic wand or whatever, and then he was in Tokyo for the G8, and they buried  a tree.  I don't know if you saw that.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  That was a good one.  They showed their commitment to the environment by burying a tree in Japan.  And then didn't they put out some kind of a publication about the president of Italy  or something, and it was really detrimental, and they said, well, we didn't write it.  We just...  They pretty much said they plagiarized it and just grabbed it off of the internet and had  to apologize to this guy.  Well, this is the Googling State Department.  You may have noticed they didn't.  They're not sure what they're saying at any given point.  And then when they say it, they go.  We didn't say that.  That wasn't us.  I think they got a bunch of interns that, you're right, they Google things, go on Wikipedia, 
[01:45:00]  and that now is how our leaders are governing the nation.  They're no better than how we prepare for this radio show.  Exactly.  You guys have someone watching over you.  We are qualified.  You'd be in trouble if you didn't do it right.  Someone would call you.  No one calls him.  When they don't do it right, no one calls the White House and gets you to do it right.  Didn't do that right.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Well, he's taking a world tour now because he doesn't want to be here because there's too  much bad things going on.  Yeah.  When you're seen at home too much during a recession and when gas is like $80 a gallon 
[01:45:30]  and stuff.  So he was in Romania because why we're attacking Dracula?  Are vampires a problem now?  He's like going to every arcane country left on the map at this point.  Just wants to be seen shaking hands with people that don't know him well enough to not like  him.  He likes the Kyrgyzstan action because then they're like, oh, you're still good.  You know, they think he's president.  Yeah.  I got to say, his popularity in the States is beginning to wane.  It really is. 
[01:46:00]  Flagging a little.  This gas thing is going to destroy people.  It's going to destroy people.  Oh, man.  Regular people.  That's what I'm saying.  He's as happy as he can be.  I think you've seen it.  Everybody's wondering, well, what was their big plan?  This is their big plan.  And it worked.  I don't know what it is here.  I passed a sign.  It's at $4.60.  In California, $5.10.  No.  Yes.  You saw $5?  On my corner.  $5.10.  Wow.  Well, I'm sorry.  $5.09.9.  I think the average is $4.11 right now. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Not in California.  We get it.  We get it sideways because of the swirling vortex of gay celebrity that we have.  The nozzle goes right into us.  We're busy thinking about killing babies.  And, you know, you know how we are.  I just don't.  There's no end to the gas prices either.  Like, there's no one trying.  No one's even giving it a whirl.  Well, I think when you got Bush and Cheney at the top there, it's pretty much for them.  And, you know, to get it up to $5.10 was the end game of the whole. 
[01:47:00]  Why did we invade Iraq and whatnot?  Well, so that they could make this much money off the.  But I thought it was a war for oil.  I thought we were supposed to be getting oil.  Yeah, but we don't get the oil.  How does that work?  We don't get the oil.  How does that work?  Because you don't run the company.  You're just a person.  But I want the oil.  So Bush is taking care of his buddies.  Yeah, I think so.  Because at this point, he doesn't give a crap.  He's out.  He's done.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is weird that gas went through the roof in his last year like this.  Weird?  I don't know.  I guess it's not that weird, right?  Well, you ever go to Houston? 
[01:47:30]  The city of Houston?  At the airport, it says, right as you're getting to the exit to the airport, it's George Herbert Walker International Airport.  And then the last exit sign says, Enron.  And the signs are directly next to each other.  Really?  You're like, huh, that's like a little novel about our country's history.  A very short story.  Yeah.  Pulling to Houston.  In Texas, where all the oil people live.  Huh.  Yeah.  It really is a bit of a coincidence.  Shocking.  A shocking coincidence. 
[01:48:00]  Okay, that's been our show.  No.  I'm joking, of course.  Let's go to Syracuse.  Let's say hi to Doug.  It's hard to disagree.  I mean, you know, it's like.  I know.  I'm trying to, like, make rhyme or reason of it.  I'm trying to find humor.  Because I didn't want to.  I never want to be one of those guys that are like, you know.  Hey, look at this.  It was just the war for oil and the Bush family and this and all kinds of.  They're the ones making money.  But then you watch what happens and you're like. 
[01:48:30]  Hey.  Well, let me put it this way.  You might be right.  When he finishes his presidency, he's not moving back to an apartment.  In Austin.  Right.  He'll be moving back to a palatial mansion.  Yeah.  The money will continue to flow toward him.  It's not like he's retiring and I'm just going to take a small, you know, economy base.  Okay, so then what is, let's say Obama gets elected.  What does he do?  Four years now.  Four years and done.  He's not in the oil biz. 
[01:49:00]  So if he doesn't have a personal interest in that, how does he bring the oil prices down?  You're asking me?  Golly.  Yes, please.  Well, in my role as a comedian, setting international oil policy is probably one of the prime directors.  I know.  If you come to comics this weekend, you'll see that not only will we be having a discussion  about that early on in the, I'll be handing out a syllabus to each and every member of  the audience so that they can follow along as I take them through what I like to call  the petrochemical follies.  I've written a parody song about it.  There's a rap I do halfway through and I have some fireworks to illustrate some of my greater 
[01:49:30]  points about the oil world.  We just feel like you're well read there.  I appreciate that.  I have no idea what Obama's going to be.  We feel that way about anybody with glasses that we're idiots.  Yeah, that's true.  I read a book.  Sadly, that book was Harry Potter.  No, I don't know what Obama's going to do.  I mean, when you get to be president, I think you're immediately connected into all those  meetings.  You are the head of the oil company.  Oh, you think there's some kind of way.  You're not the head, but you're told what to do by them.  I mean, my understanding is, right, interlocking boards of directors of thousands of corporations 
[01:50:00]  and there's ten people in the world.  Illuminati.  Right, and then they call you into a room and as Bill Hicks said, they show you a videotape  of the Azopruder film from another angle and they go, any questions?  Love that one.  That's a great line, man.  Great.  Now what?  Yeah, and so I think he'll be at the same behest that every president is at the behest of  those people.  But what about all the change he's promising?  So much change.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's time for change.  It is time for change.  I don't know that the system changes things.  I think people change things. 
[01:50:30]  Do a change search on YouTube.  You'll see a lot of presidential candidates saying exactly the same thing over the years.  They were going to change this and that and what's happening.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Let's go to Doug in Syracuse.  Doug, what's up, buddy?  Hi, guys.  Big fan of your show.  Many years listening.  Trying to call in all the time.  Thank you, sir.  And I'm calling in to ask Stephen to please, please, please play Almighty Malachi, Professional  Bowling God.  Wow.  Nice.  The classic bowling song.  I hate that one. 
[01:51:00]  Please.  I hate you.  I've never heard the full thing.  I hate you all.  I've never heard the full thing.  And you never will, sir.  He played it back in the day on our show?  Yeah.  I played it on this show and that's the reason that drunken idiots shouted at me every single  show I do because it got such a great reaction on the Opiate Anthony show.  It took on a life of its own there, Stephen.  It did, yes.  Did it do well?  I don't remember the show.  No, it didn't, Jim.  It's great.  I've been trying to bury it for years now and it keeps getting resurrected. 
[01:51:30]  Also, this is not a good phone call to take, huh?  Did that actually happen?  I appreciate it.  It's a great song.  It really is.  You won't be cracking it out tonight?  I actually love the song now, but...  Maybe I will do it tomorrow night in Atlantic City.  At the House of House of Louis.  Oh, come on.  Did someone yell it out in Sweden?  Yeah.  I've never done a show where someone hasn't shouted it out.  That's the reach of the show.  Oh, my God.  In Sweden, someone yelled out, do the bowling song?  Yes.  And you yelled at...  Did you...  They went, hurt if hurt if hurt in bowling song. 
[01:52:00]  Did you yell at them?  Of course.  I kicked them out of the show.  Wait, that would be a very funny encore.  Wait, for the newbies, though...  For the newbies, what does it mean?  Opie, I can see the wheels turning in your head and I'm not going to do the song.  No, that's not what I'm getting at, actually.  For the newbies, though, what was the bowling song story all about?  You really felt good about the song and you played it?  No, I never felt good about the song.  I don't remember.  I'm not even trying to set you up to...  It was a terrible, terrible song.  No, it's great.  All right.  Let me get dug on hold for a minute. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, even Zeppelin put out some clunkers.  Come on.  Not many.  Not many.  Yes.  Yeah, not everything.  Escalated to Purgatory was a horrible bomb.  It was well delivered.  What's the story of the bowling song?  All right, the bowling song, I wrote it, I don't know, I wrote it ten years ago.  I came in and I had nothing to play on your show.  I'd exhausted all of my repertoire.  And I played it and you guys just stared at me.  I mean, it was...  I get goosebumps just thinking.  And that was back in the days where, you know, you guys had like 15 listeners and I 
[01:53:00]  was one of the first people on the show and you guys were laughing at everything.  This is great.  Yeah.  And then finally, you...  And those 15 told some other 15.  You told 15.  Years later, I come back and again, I don't have anything to play.  And you're like, why don't you play us that bowling song again?  We really like that song.  And like an idiot, I was like, okay.  Oh, no.  That'll be great.  Same exact reaction.  I don't remember the damn song.  Let me play it for you, Jim.  I wouldn't mind one verse of it or one line of it. 
[01:53:30]  I don't remember the song.  No.  Look, it's not going to...  Dude, I've bombed a million times on the lines.  It doesn't matter.  Who cares?  I mean, like if...  You look so good.  You are so good.  You've almost got me convinced to play the song.  But I don't even...  You don't have to play the song.  I mean, what is the opening line?  Just you can say it.  I'm not even going to say the opening line.  Does anybody remember it?  He really wants this song to go away.  I really don't remember.  Something about bowling.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I think it's funny.  It's a horrible song. 
[01:54:00]  You rarely bomb, dude.  Everything you do.  Seriously.  All of his stuff is funny.  I mean, every song he does is original.  Great voice.  Funny.  I mean, you have one bad one.  It's kind of humanizing.  It's not even that bad.  It's what we did with the song.  Yeah.  Well...  I'm serious.  It's bad.  Because now I like the song.  See, Jimmy, what it was was a song with a lot of inside references to professional bowling.  So I don't think a lot of...  It was very niche.  But if you were into professional bowling...  Yeah.  It was a scream.  So if you were from Dayton, Ohio, right, and lived in an orange house, this was right 
[01:54:30]  up here.  Yes.  And went to Costco.  And from Syracuse, apparently.  Right.  And went up from Syracuse.  It mentioned people's names that were on the professional bowlers tour.  Old-time bowlers?  Very old-time.  Why don't we do...  Marshall Holman, Gary Dickens.  Right, right.  Get in line for your ass kick-ins.  Right.  Sweet.  See, this is coming from a guy who thought he was the best bowler in the world.  John Petraglia.  John Petraglia, Norm Duke.  You're so lame, it makes me...  God, it's the worst...  So far, not one that I know. 
[01:55:00]  It's so bad.  When do you get to Dick Webber?  Oh, you want to hear the great Dick Webber line?  Yeah, what's the...  This is genius.  Yeah.  Poor Steve.  How about Dick Webber or his son Pete?  I'll turn you both to cream of wheat.  I'm not proud of this song.  It's a lot.  Hey, Steve, it's just going to be at the House of Blues tomorrow night.  Greg Proofs is going to be at Comics, what, 9th and 14th.  But I'm not sure how beating someone in bowling makes them a breakfast food.  Exactly. 
[01:55:30]  You know what?  You're lying.  That wasn't the line.  That is the line.  There's no way you wrote that.  That's such a coincidence.  I wrote a Frosted Mini Wheat Webber thing, and I had it in my app for years.  Well, how about in his son Pete?  It's actually, I'll turn you mother effers to cream of wheat.  Oh, wow.  Now you're talking.  How about I'll beat you like you're my meat?  Anthony, you don't know.  That would be a better line.  You don't believe you used that line?  No.  Well, let's find out for a second.  Oh, come on.  Oh, no.  Why would you do this?  Why are you doing this to me?  The guy's a friend.  What?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, God.  Why would you watch me on your TV? 
[01:56:00]  Say that my job is easy.  You say I am not athletic.  Why are you turning red?  You think my sport's pathetic. 
[01:56:30]  See, at this point, you don't know what sport I'm talking about.  Yeah.  But you can't judge me till you walked a mile in my bowling shoe.  Got a ball that's smooth and all black.  Uh-huh. 
[01:57:00]  Keep it in my favorite ball sack.  Oh, yeah.  Get a feeling in my soul.  I'll see.  Oh, yeah.

[01:59:00]  ste-reich  chris shenkels uh smiling somewhere  early got in there too  Yeah, he did.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  At least I committed to it.  I've never seen you read her in real life.  I'm so embarrassed by that song.  Let me tell you something, Stephen.  Your voice is fantastic in that, as it is usually.  And the melody is great. 
[01:59:30]  You should use it for another song.  I should rewrite the song.  You should rewrite a whole new song.  Use the melody.  It's very nice.  I'm more embarrassed about the fact that I tittered through the whole thing.  You tittered.  You did.  A nervous little titter through the whole thing.  Because the looks.  Well, I just got them again.  It's the same thing.  Write a badminton song.  Three times now.  Three times.  Three times.  Trying to get the chuckles going.  Laugh like that.  No, it was like.  I think I was looking at the clock and cut out five verses of the song. 
[02:00:00]  He just wanted it done.  Listen.  Left out the whole Brunswick paragraph you had written.  Let it be known, because you might be confused out there.  We love Stephen Lynch.  We really do.  He's going to be at the House of Blues tomorrow night in Atlantic City.  StephenLynch.com.  Greg Proops, Comic, C-O-M-I-X, Comedy Club here in New York City, 9th and 14th Street,  tonight and tomorrow night.  That's right.  And I'll have jokes as well as talking about the oil situation.  Oh, we know that.  Yeah.  No, we do.  Remember OPEC.  I like your stuff on pop culture. 
[02:00:30]  I'm sure you got a little something something on pop culture.  Maybe we go down that road after the break.  All right.  All right.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  We got Greg Proops in the studio playing Comics Word tonight and tomorrow.  C-O-M-I-X.com if you want to check out comics and see Greg Proops this weekend.  Or go to GregProops.com.  Then you got Stephen Lynch over there on the couch playing House of Blues tomorrow night  in Atlantic City.  I think we should give him a chance to redeem himself. 
[02:01:00]  That's what I'm thinking.  Nah.  I'm happy with the way that all panned out, OPEC.  Thanks.  Someone's confused, though.  They're like, if you hate the bowling song so much, why did you put it on one of your  CDs?  I didn't hate it as much then.  And I needed filler.  Good answer.  I like the answer.  Very good answer.  All right.  We got Joe Berg hanging out with Stephen Lynch.  Berg.  I'm assuming he's going to do something with you because he's been sitting in front of  a microphone this whole time.  No, I'm going to play by myself for a while.  Yeah, I'm just hanging with Steve. 
[02:01:30]  He's eye candy.  Oh, okay.  Hello.  Can you hear that?  Yes.  All right.  I call this one, um, lacrosse man.  That's a joke.  I got it.  I got it.  Lacrosse song.  What arcane sport can we get to next?  This one's mumbledy peg boy.  Who likes lawn darts?  Get them up!  Atlantic City.  What did I play last time?  I played that diary song. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, that was good.  That went over very well.  I went back to that book of diaries that I was telling you about, and I found another  really beautiful entry.  Okay.  So, now I think every song is going to be the new bowling.  No!  Will you stop?  I saw you at Central Park.  You killed.  People were loving you.  This is a new diary entry that I thought was a really remarkable one, so I set it to music.  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:02:30]  Dear diary, today was a great day.  I bought myself a brand new horse.  She's strong and fast and so very beautiful.  And just a little wild, of course.  I know tomorrow I can tame her.  If I only believe, wish me luck diary, Christopher Reeve. 
[02:03:00]  I just thought it was a really lovely way of expressing his love of the animal.  I haven't heard from him recently, so I thought what's been going on, but I thought the sentiment  was really nice.  Sweet!  I had no idea where you were going with that, too.  That's really funny, man.  I say, what bowling song now?  There you go.  That's how you do that.  People will be yelling Christopher Reeves out tonight, man.  That's great.  I have a feeling.  Play the Christopher Reeves song. 
[02:03:30]  That was a Swedish heckler.  I have a feeling you're going to be going down this diary road for a while now.  No.  There might be a few more of them.  I'm guessing there's more diary entries.  Yeah, I'm thinking.  Well, let me see if I can come up with one off the top of my head.  Oh, all right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:04:00]  I just think it's a beautiful relationship they must have had for him to write so expressively  in a diary about me.  That didn't work out too well for Marvin, huh?  Every time something happens in the news, I'm like, all right, Elliot Spitzer. 
[02:04:30]  What rhymes with Spitzer?  White wine spritzer.  But I don't want to be that guy.  Spitzer.  Spitzer.  Do you have one more?  This diary thing is just fantastic.  Yeah.  It's a real diary.  We're going to be moving backwards.  I'm hoping the next one's going to be like Farrah Fawcett or somebody.  Dear diary.  Charlie's Angels was great today.  Dear diary, today was a grand day. 
[02:05:00]  Took a bath at a spot of tea.  Did the New York Times crossword puzzle.  Listen to a symphony.  I think I'll go for a leisurely drive now.  See what the day will bring.  Life is good, love.  Rodney King. 
[02:05:30]  I tried to throw you off with the whole New York Times crossword puzzle.  He can do the New York Times crossword puzzle, you racist.  He can do it.  You think?  Well, just the Mondays.  That's all the diaries I have so far.  What's a seven-letter word for bludgeoning?  N-I.  There's going to be a few more, though, I'm sure.  Yeah, probably.  Rodney King.  Yeah, very nice.  Hey, welcome to 1994, everybody. 
[02:06:00]  I'm going to crack out some Clinton jokes in honor of that.  She cut off his what?  Right.  You got one more for us, Stephen Lynch?  House of Blues tomorrow night, Atlantic City?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I got some new songs.  Here we go.  How about this one?  I hope Anthony likes this one.  All right.  Because, really, I ripped this entire thing off from you.  Oh, nice.  I got to set it up, though.  Hey, you know what I found out the other day?  It turns out I have a relative who lived in the 16th century or the 17th century who did 
[02:06:30]  exactly what I do for a living.  He was both a troubadour and a court jester.  Wow.  Yeah, and he used to play a lute at the court, you know, for the king and queen.  And I dug up one of his old compositions, and I learned it.  And this is what I think it sounded like.  Come, fair lady, to mine bed we go, and verily sweet pleasures we shall know. 
[02:07:00]  Yet, where thy belly meets thy limb, I beseech thee, give a trim.  For thy bush doth overflow.  My lady doth have a 70s muff.  A 1670s muff. 
[02:07:30]  Not since Rapunzel have I seen such locks.  Looks like thou hast a leg lock on an ox.  Pray, shave it off to make a coat.  There are fur balls down my throat when I feast upon thy box.  I saith not thy vagina's hair suit, but it looketh like thou hath dropped bubble yum on ye olde barbershop floor. 
[02:08:00]  Bubble yum?  It's a little anachronistic, but that's how Anthony says it, so I copied him directly.  But soft, what hair through yonder girdle grows, to be, or not to be, put in cornrows.  Oh, it is beastly and unruly, and it smelleth like patchouli, and that offends my nose. 
[02:08:30]  I saith not thou art furry down there, but it doth resemble Henry VIII eating a London broil.  Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  Medieval Bush  The whole time we're sitting there going,  all right, well, they're dumping that.  That'll be dumb.  They're dumping that word.  Are they serious?  I don't know.  You never know what this is.  It was cleverly disguised in ye olde language. 
[02:09:00]  I thought it was.  I thought it was clever enough to let it go through.  We're waiting.  How many dumps there?  He hasn't told me.  Yeah, well, because he's wiping the sweat off his head.  One dump.  One dump.  Hey.  It was four minutes long.  That's not too bad, right?  Good.  Well, we're running out of show, Mr. Proops.  Yeah.  Is that it?  It's on this side.  Well, then we go over to the other place.  We go over to the filthy mouth portion of the program.  Oh, hooray. 
[02:09:30]  Why the sarcasm, sir?  That's all I've got.  That's all you got on that?  Snideness and sarcasm.  Yeah.  You got any...  Occasional witticism?  Well, we got like a minute or two.  You got anything on what's going on in the pop culture world?  Anything, you know, hitting you?  Tickle your fancy?  Yeah, I was trying to come up and then I realized that would be dumb to say.  So I stopped myself.  No, I appreciate that.  Yeah.  I always have something going on.  You saw that Britney Spears' baby sister had a baby. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  What you don't know is that Britney Spears' baby sister's baby is also having a baby.  That's how white trash they are.  There was some hot prenatal action going on there.  That baby's going to be born to the aluminum siding of a mobile home into a vat of Dr. Pepper.  Come up, pull up its underoos.  Here's my Grooties.  I want some beads.  I want to do a shot of Southern Comfort.  Because Britney Spears is young, right? 
[02:10:30]  She's what, like 25?  She's still not that old.  No.  Well, she's like 80 in white trash years.  Oh, no kidding.  She's like a grandmother in white trash.  Great grandma.  I think she's 27 maybe?  No.  I don't even know if she's that old.  Really?  She looks terrific.  People say she's a bad mother all the time and I'm like, you know, kids are demanding.  Kids are always like, feed me and whatnot, you know, hold me, raise me, give me guidance.  You know what?  Bug off.  Mommy's a star. 
[02:11:00]  I got to get my store of on.  Out of my neck, you fat, squalling, no-neck, meth-addicted spawn of Federline.  Come back in 16 years when you can score and we'll have an interesting conversation.  If I was her age, I'd do drugs too.  I'd have like Ecuador delivered to my house every morning.  And I would wade naked across the lawn, wearing nothing but purple lavender hip boots with  conchos up the side like Prince on the Purple Rain Tour, absorbing whiff into every orifice 
[02:11:30]  of my body until a french fry that had lodged in my heart exploded and a hooker shot out  my butt, eating a jalapeno popper.  That's how I would roll if I had her Spielbergian budget.  You asked about pop culture and I certainly did.  Just spilled it right out.  I certainly did.  Here it comes.  I'm excited to see that, what is it, Hancock or whatever with Will Smith?  Oh, yeah.  Is it Charlize Theron's in that?  I think about comedy, I think Charlize Theron. 
[02:12:00]  I think her subtle stylings of comedy have led to so many chuckles in my life.  I can't remember the last time I didn't flip on Aeon Flux and just lose it.  Put away your feathers in your rubber chickens.  Charlize is back and she's adjudicating in the comedy court.  Didn't she play Eileen Warmest too?  Hilarious movie.  If you saw Monster.  Now, if you like laughing like I like laughing, Jim, and I think you do.  Eileen Wuornos, female serial killer. 
[02:12:30]  Hilarious turn in that one.  Sweet November with Keanu where she dies.  I couldn't stop.  With the laughing.  Giggle fest.  Sure.  Giggle.  Tittering, as Stephen would say.  She's a...  I tittered.  I tittered.  Her and Nicole Kidman, I think, really have a lock on that comedy thing.  I don't know if you saw Bewitched with Nicole Kidman, but wow.  I never thought the TV show was funny until I saw the movie of Bewitched.  Then I went back and reappraised some of Mr. Tate's early work. 
[02:13:00]  Larry Tate.  Nicole Kidman is...  I don't know that in real life either of them could ever get a...  They're the kind of people...  You'll back me up on this.  When you go to do a private gig, Jim, and the person comes out from the private gig,  like whatever, it's a corporate or whatever, you're some private thing, and they'll go,  we're a fun group.  You know then that they're Nazis.  There's just no other way around it.  Anyone who tells you they're a fun group are horrible, horrible human beings.  Whether it's their lawyers or doctors or they just...  They slaughter babies, whatever they do. 
[02:13:30]  They're not going to laugh at anything you say.  And it's like if you go to someone's house and they go, I heard something funny.  You're almost guaranteed that whatever comes subsequent to that comment is going to be  like a baby's open grave.  You're just going to be like, no.  Not only was it not funny, I ripped my own eyes out and fed them to an otter.  Simply to get away from the rest of this situation.  That's the truth, though.  People who think they're funny aren't funny.  People who think they're cute.  You know that?  When they think they're cute.  Oh, and they think they're cute.  You know, and you're like... 
[02:14:00]  Like Martha Stewart, Rachel Ray, or whatever, that Oprah.  I think I'm cute.  Like, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.  This is heinous, McTavish.  You're like the Roman army.  You're that cute.  A lot of people find Rachel Ray hot.  I don't see that one.  Like a turtle bereft of its shell.  There's no shoulders.  Right.  Weird man hands.  Right.  Giant fingers that resemble John Holmes' coke erections from the 70s.  Can I say that, or will they bump that?  Dump that, as you say.  Who knows.  She has horrible sea creature hands.  Like weird anemones that you find at the bottom of the coral reef. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, I don't really find her very...  She says yummo.  That's it.  I'm done.  You put your weird man hands in my food, and you said yummo.  I'm officially off food.  Yeah.  It makes me sick till the end of time.  Did she say yummo?  That's her thing.  She says the word yummo.  Everyone needs, you know, a little catchphrase.  Yeah.  I'm glad I didn't know that.  No.  She has a small cat head.  Mm-hmm.  Bizarre man hands.  Great, though.  No shoulders.  After just a great money shot, look at her face and just go, yeah, yummo.  Yummo to you. 
[02:15:00]  You put her say it into the camera while she's crying, like Irene Cara in Fame.  Yeah.  Yummo.  That's right, Coco.  That's right.  Put your thumb in your mouth and say yummo.  Coco.  Coco.  Make a symbol.  Hey, Bruno, man.  Well, that's it.  The music has begun, so let's get the plugs in.  We got Stephen Lynch, House of Blues, tomorrow night in Atlantic City.  StephenLynch.com.  And then Greg Proops, tonight and tomorrow night at Comics Comedy Club here in New York City.  That is 9th Avenue and 14th Street for the most part.  Yes, it is. 
[02:15:30]  And you can go to C-O-M-I-X.com for ticket info.  Wait, is it Comics New York or is it just Comics?  What was it?  I think it's just Comics.  I think they got Comics.com with the X.  Yeah, I do believe.  Or go to Greg Proops.com.  It's got an X at the end, so don't let that fool you if you're a good speller.  There you go.  Google Comics Comics.  What?  What?  It's Comics NY.  Oh, boy.  I'm good.  It's Comics NY.  I'm good.  It's Comics NY.com.  So it's C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com for Greg Proops info.  Okay?  Comics.  They don't call me the website kid for nothing. 
[02:16:00]  No.  We're going over to XM.  You guys have a great weekend.  Thanks, guys.  Bye, folks.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM 202. 
[02:16:30]  Ah.  Well, there's bright lights here, so I don't know if all the buttons are on.  Everyone should just start talking and we can see.  All right.  Hello.  I'm good.  They insist on this bright light above my head for some reason.  It's a halo.  Yeah, but we don't want that.  Whatever.  It's too inside.  Sorry.  Good morning.  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  Greg Proops made the walkover today.  He's playing comics.  Hello, everybody.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com for ticket info for Greg Proops. 
[02:17:00]  I go and see Greg every time he's in New York City.  You're awfully good about that.  This time I will not be attending because I've got to go somewhere else.  What the hell, hacking?  I've got to go hang out with the Philly crew this weekend.  So I'm going down to Philly.  And we've got a huge audience outside the studio where you guys are.  Yes.  Look at these animals, Greg.  What do you think?  I think it's fantastic they're behind glass.  Well.  It's like a human aquarium out here.  We do drag them in every so often.  Let them hang out in here. 
[02:17:30]  In your Coke dealer Playboy lounge here with the corner couches.  All we're missing is some smoke mirrors.  You guys want to stay up and bullshit all night and just talk about stuff and whatnot?  Yeah, you're right.  Do some shooters.  Maybe drink some Malibu.  Really get it going.  The design on this place stinks.  We kept the console all the way back here when we could have just right in the middle there  where everyone could see us.  No problem.  Now they all have to turn their neck to the right to see us.  I was going to say, you've got them sort of at an odd angle here.  They're like at the far turn here and we're on the finish line. 
[02:18:00]  We should have had the console right there in the middle and everything would have been great.  And then the bands could have performed here.  Remember the bands that were supposed to be?  All right.  Who designed this room?  Escher?  Good night, everybody.  An Escher joke.  I like it.  I take you high.  Yeah.  And I leave you there.  That's my comedy.  Hey, we got a...  You're adrift now.  Goodbye.  We got a great show, actually, today, if this works out.  Got any bands?  Well, we got a hypnotist.  A hypnotist on the radio?  But.  But. 
[02:18:30]  Not your normal...  We're not doing...  Hacky, let's...  Joe Blow, you know, do chickens shit.  I hate doing that.  This is...  Hi, who are you?  Are you the hypnotist?  I am.  You hypnotize people.  I do.  Very hypnotic.  Very.  Two big blue eyes.  Gaze into them.  Mmm.  Do you use a watch?  No.  What do you use?  Because they tried to hypnotize me once.  Many, many years ago in therapy.  I didn't have enough money for good therapy. 
[02:19:00]  They did it in front of a class.  Like a dental school or whatever?  Yeah.  Exactly what it was.  Mental school.  I was going to RCHP.  Rutgers Health or some shit in Jersey.  Wait.  I thought you were setting up a joke.  They really did it.  That makes me laugh so much.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  It's the truth.  Look at this Froot Loops box.  You know how it is.  Because we all occasionally, when we're 19, experience a little sexual dysfunction.  Surely not.  Oh, no.  Oh, you know how it is.  So, you have to be willing to be put under. 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  Because Colin wanted to hypnotize us on Tough Crowd one time.  And he wanted to hypnotize Patrice.  Where every time he would say a word, Patrice would just shut up.  Yeah.  Because Patrice likes to talk.  But Patrice wouldn't try.  He said he couldn't be put under.  Well, you have to want to do it.  Yeah.  A lot of times, people come on a show and they'll go, hey, go ahead and try to put me under.  But it's probably not going to work.  God, I dare you.  Yeah.  That doesn't work like that.  Yeah, you have to want to.  Do you do the type of hypnotism where lightning shoots out of your fingertips and goes into 
[02:20:00]  the people's eyeballs?  Yeah.  That's how I know.  I know Deborah LaFave's on TV.  Oh, breaking news.  Because we've been following.  Deborah LaFave.  Smoking.  Her what?  House arrest is ending today.  House arrest is ending.  We were just talking about this.  Sorry.  We'll get back to you in a second.  She's too hot to keep under any kind of arrest.  Greg Proops, here's our observation.  Line up 14-year-olds.  It's on.  You got a lot of teachers sleeping with students, right?  Yeah.  Well, we noticed, and we did a little exercise yesterday in the show.  The uglier the teacher, the more time she gets, my friend. 
[02:20:30]  Uglier?  The uglier the teacher.  The longer the sentence is.  The longer the sentence is.  Oh, I see, right.  Deborah LaFave already out.  Deborah LaFave.  She never really got anything.  Look at her.  She's a supermodel.  Of course.  She got house arrest, and the house arrest was supposed to.  It was supposed to be three years.  Three years.  There's not a kid in America who's not like, yes.  House arrest at the judge's house.  I sentence you.  Come to my house every weekend.  I had Mrs. Brady.  She had gray hair and little glasses like Theodore Roosevelt.  That's the teacher I got. 
[02:21:00]  I know.  I never got a Deborah LaFave.  No.  Not even in the ballpark.  I never got one.  I had a French teacher, blonde with big bosoms.  Really?  And showed off the cleavage to everybody, yeah.  We all felt like we had a chance.  Really?  No, I don't think anyone officially went in for the kill, but we all really thought that  we could have sex.  See, now I was in a youth group, and the guy who ran the youth group got with one of the  girls that was my age at the time.  He was like 16.  But then they ended up getting married, so I don't know if that's harassment or simply 
[02:21:30]  just taking over someone's life.  Yeah.  I'm going to have an affair with you, though you're 16, but later I shall marry you.  The teacher who married that kid, Veli, the first big case like this, I mean, they're  still married.  She's like in her 40s, and he's still like 20, 21, 20-something, and they got a couple  kids, I believe.  Deborah LaFave, that's just outrageous.  You can't do that.  You can't be parading around like that.  Hey, Danny, show Greg the video of the other one we were talking about today.  Oh, the other one.  Pop that up on the screen.  Yeah.  You'll get no argument.  But we don't see a problem with really hot teachers having sex with kids. 
[02:22:00]  No.  I've left that out of my routine, but almost every comic in America is doing a bit about it  now, because it is such a rich, fertile goldmine of, whoa, whoa, whoa, what was that?  That was just his desktop.  Yeah, I was going to say, Broheim, what do you...  Yeah, that's his background.  I don't even want to...  That's his background.  That was like taking a short walk.  A fine honey hole.  Yeah, your psyche was exposed there, and it was redolent with booty.  Nice.  I don't know that I'm ready to travel that area.  Now, here's another hot teacher story. 
[02:22:30]  This teacher got in trouble, and she couldn't stop.  She finally sent this video we're about to play for you to a 14-year-old boy.  To a boy.  This is after she was already in big trouble.  Are you about age 14?  Yeah, and the video's up on onaradio.com, but for you, Greg.  Yes.  I want to see this.  I really do.  We don't understand how these teachers get caught.  We think it's a jealous friend, because the guy that's having sex has to tell a friend,  and then the friend gets...  This is a teacher?  Yes.  My teacher didn't look like that. 
[02:23:00]  Look at this animal.  Get out of here.  Mrs. Spaghetti was horrible.  Watch the bend over.  There you go.  She sent this to a 14-year-old?  Yeah.  I like how it's looped.  I like pictures of her farting the whole time she's doing that.  Got it made.  Got it made.  Oh, there we go.  There you go.  Now, the wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.  Hokey mokey.  Right in front of the webcam.  What do you guys think of that video out there?  Pretty good?  Why can't they see it?  You got to get that up there for them.  You want to hear my joke on the fucking teachers.  I have a great bit.  Oh, do you?  On the teachers having sex with students? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  What?  I go, uh...  Well, why didn't that happen to me?  Yeah, right.  Fucking place goes nuts.  That's what I'm talking about.  Is there a comic in America who isn't doing that bit this year?  I mean, that's the thing.  You see every comic doing it.  I know.  Where were those teachers when I was in trouble?  I know.  That's the thing.  I only say that in, like, the funny abduction murder cases.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If someone's buried underground for six months, then I'd say that.  Exactly.  Jimmy, could you explain this animal to everybody out there? 
[02:24:00]  She's got the...  Oh.  She has really...  She kind of looks...  In a way, she looks a little bit like a tranny from the back with a great ass...  What?  What?  Why are you wrecking this for everybody?  I'm not.  I'm making it better for myself.  I was going to say, yeah, that we're...  Great thigh highs.  She's wearing black.  White thigh highs, right?  She's wearing, like, Aussie gloves from 1977.  Mm-hmm.  Those fucking, uh...  With the pony?  Yeah.  McGillia?  Yeah, she has, like, little riding gloves.  Little, uh...  Black...  I'm doing a terrible job.  Black bra, black thong, fat little pussy, and, uh... 
[02:24:30]  Great fucking nice white thigh highs.  I'm much better ass than Deborah LaFaul.  Yeah, I don't know.  Really?  Deborah LaFaul.  This girl has a nice little fucking...  Pretty hot.  This girl has a bit of a little cum belly.  Like, a bit of...  Florentine used to call it a seed belly.  Like, whatever girl had her gut, he'd say it's a seed belly.  Yeah, but maybe she just needs some gas acts.  She's a little bloated.  Just needs to blow out some air, that's all.  I'll be honest, she's a little too available.  Yeah.  You think?  Just a tad.  I'm a little more of the Deborah LaFaul type.  Here's what's sexy about this.  I like it pinned down more.  Her ass is so juicy that the fucking thong disappears between the ass cheeks. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  That fucking turns me on, because it means that the ass crack is deep.  I like a fucking deep crack.  I'm running under those.  That's my campaign slogan.  Deep cracked girls get tax breaks.  So you hypnotize people.  All right, let's get back to the hypnotist.  Could you hypnotize me into, like, I'm on an island somewhere, and she's dancing like that,  and then she just begins shitting like a horse as she's walking?  Oh, yeah, that's one of my tricks I do a lot. 
[02:25:30]  Well, what should...  Remember, you have to be willing to do that.  You can't be dragged unwilling into that.  What's the big plug for the hypnotist thing?  Yeah.  The big plug?  I'll be in Arlington, Virginia, July 26th and August 9th at the sports pub in Arlington.  That's a long time from now.  Yeah.  You should get a better book.  It's my latest gigs.  So what do you do?  Like, are you a therapist, or how did you become the hypnotist?  I have a gig in January of 2014 I'd like to talk about, if that's all I'm with everybody. 
[02:26:00]  It's not comedy.  I'm just performing a bat mitzvah.  It's a substitute thing.  Just remember it.  At least you picked...  I like the fact that you picked very popular locations, and everybody would be, you know,  fucking...  Yeah, sure.  The tomb of the unknown soldier.  I'll be in Pahrumpf, Nevada.  Fucking trailer behind Art Bell's fucking rape house.  So you're...  I don't know. 
[02:26:30]  I couldn't...  I would have said rape trailer, like this one serial killer, but then I would have said  trailer twice.  You know, redundancies.  So you're...  How long...  You been a therapist, or no?  Yeah.  I've been doing this over 15 years.  Okay.  All right, so you think you might get to Patty today.  This is where we're heading.  We got stalker Patty here, and we finally got her to open up a little bit about her childhood,  and we're thinking that her father touched her.  Foster father.  Foster father.  Yeah.  So we're thinking that we might be able to get some stuff out of her if she's relaxed  and hypnotized.  It's possible.  One thing you need to remember is that under hypnosis, you will lie. 
[02:27:00]  You will lie?  Really?  Or you have the capability of lying?  That's why it is not admissible in court.  Oh, right.  I didn't know it was.  Why would you...  Why will you lie?  Is it that you think you know what they want to hear, or you're actually aware of the fact  that you're lying?  No, because if it's something so personal that is that deep that's going to bother you,  you may not say what people want to hear.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Is it true that it enhances memory, or is that just a myth?  Like, you can pick out a license plate that you saw briefly. 
[02:27:30]  Can it relax you enough to get back?  Is that what it does?  It relaxes you enough?  They do actually have forensic hypnosis, where they have people do just what you say.  If you saw a license plate, it'll, you know...  Did you dye your hair blonde, Jared?  Oh, it's always been that beautiful?  Can you hypnotize this oaf?  Yes.  Into buying a shirt that doesn't hug his gut?  An ogre.  Now, we love you, Jared.  You wore a hat made of my shit.  But it's just the shirt, the way it wraps around, it's almost showcasing...  What are you doing?  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  You have the body of a middle-aged guy that's just, like, out of shape and stuff.  He's trying to look thinner.  You don't have to take that, Jared.  Just come back with the big comebacks, like, oh, yeah?  Yeah, exactly.  Same to you, buddy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Twice in your pipe.  Don't hit that hard.  Actually, his nickname is Cream Pie Jones.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's sweet.  Because he shoots loads into his girl without a condom.  That's right.  And it has her face hit him.  Yeah.  This is the great Cream Pie Joe.  Why am I hungry? 
[02:28:30]  I want tapioca.  So, Cream Pie.  Yes.  So, you hypnotize people.  Are we switching again?  Yeah, I don't know.  I didn't have anything.  I like Cream Pie.  What am I going to say?  Thank you.  Can we hypnotize Cream Pie to do something?  Like not wear Kelly Green when it's not St. Patrick's Day?  It's good you're trying to blend in that fucking shirt.  Can we do a Stalker Patty slash Cream Pie Jones slash who else?  Who else?  Can we hypnotize a girl into there? 
[02:29:00]  All right.  There's a girl in there.  Can we hypnotize one of the women in there into possibly thinking my penis is a flute?  A flute or a piccolo?  What tune?  A free bird.  That's all that.  Flight of the Bumblebee.  Oh, yeah.  How about Jethro Tull?  Yeah, Jethro Tull.  I'm going to go obscure, but I think living in the room.  In the past, the original version was like 20-some-odd minutes long.  In a Vida de Gada.  In a Vida de Gada? 
[02:29:30]  What the fuck?  What's the name of that shitty song?  In a Vida de Gada.  What's the name of the song?  In a Gada de Vida.  Oh, whatever.  You did the Ramones version.  Yeah, right.  In a Vida de Gada.  In a Vida de Gada.  Two, three, four.  Ah, so what?  That shit is song.  Yeah.  Well, the real reason we got you in here is to hypnotize Patty and see if we can get anything  out of her.  Yeah, we want some kind of a memory, you know, like one of those regression things.  Yeah, why don't we go with that? 
[02:30:00]  And then maybe we do some other stuff.  I don't know.  Could you hypnotize Patty into thinking that there's cocaine on her wrists and she has  to cut it up over a mirror?  Yeah, can we get her to do some crazy stuff?  Oh, sorry.  I got a groan out there.  Was that a little too much?  I apologize.  Fucking audience.  I think they do that lovingly, though.  Oh, okay.  I really do.  I apologize.  Could you hypnotize the comedy fans of New York into coming to comics this weekend?  Oh.  Apparently leaving or going south of 14th Street is a difficult task for some people.  It's scary for some. 
[02:30:30]  Yes, yes, yes.  Yeah, I don't know.  Uh, does this really work?  I mean, let's, you know, come on.  Hey, half-hearted McTavish.  Come on, Doc.  Can people really be hypnotized?  Talk to me.  You bet.  Why don't we get the...  Guess my new character, the Skeptic.  I think Jimmy got a skeptical turkey sandwich man.  Ted the Skeptic.  I don't believe it's a pack of lies.  Ted the Skeptic.  Why don't we get the hypnotizing? 
[02:31:00]  Hypnotize my foot.  It's a pack of lies.  How long do you need, Doc?  This is a passel of half-truths.  Give me about 15 minutes or something.  15 minutes?  Can we get, like, that chair, like, you know, nice and comfortable for Patty, maybe?  I don't know.  15 minutes?  I can hypnotize a crowd into leaving in five minutes.  I don't know if it'll really, like, work in here, because, like, what...  I know what Don likes to do is...  No, no, no.  I mean when she's hypnotized, I want her to be very comfortable.  Oh, I have a chair, like...  Yeah.  We can do that.  All right.  Put him on the Coke dealer couch over there. 
[02:31:30]  We have to bring her somewhere nice and quiet, like, into a room.  So we're going to do...  Yeah, we're going to bring her to the back office while this all happens, so they can  close the shades, and I think Don usually puts some music on for them.  So we'll have Patty back there.  You want Cream Pie Jones in there?  You're going to get extra dates.  No, no Cream Pie.  Let's just do Patty.  Because it's really about...  The whole reason we're doing this, we really want to see if we can get anything else out  of Patty, because so far she told us that when she used to take baths, the father, the foster  father would come in and have to shave and brush his teeth.  And shave while she's naked in the bathtub.  Yeah.  She would have to sleep with him on the couch. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, wow.  I don't have a problem with that.  Yeah, there was a sleeping on the couch thing where if they went away, her brother would have  to sleep with her mother, and Patty would have to sleep with her foster father.  All right, everybody put your hand up who didn't do that.  Oh, no.  Makes me want to be a foster parent.  Of course.  All right, once you get going...  We send you the little things.  Not a big brother?  Yeah.  What kind of baby do you want?  Do you have one that's 15 with kind of a fat pussy? 
[02:32:30]  Come on.  How do you define fat?  There goes the hypnotist.  The type you can see through fucking corduroys.  Snow pants.  Snow pants, yeah.  Through a space suit.  You like fat, like the whole area around it.  Like a blast zone.  I like the lips to be fat.  I like the clit to be protruding obscenely.  Really?  Like Vanessa Del Rio.  Like Ziggy, the cartoon character.  She has to apologize. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, I'm sorry.  My clit is on the table again.  Right.  Like a matriculating caterpillar.  Like old snuffleupagus puss.  Oh, that's going to be my nickname for her.  Snuff cunt.  Mastodon chunk.  Should we take our first break?  And then when we get back...  Uh-oh.  What happened?  The hypnotist is...  He's gone?  What are you doing?  We're waiting.  We're waiting.  We're setting up.  Oh, no.  We're setting up.  He's putting her in a dildo chair.  All right. 
[02:33:30]  Well, as he sets up and hypnotizes...  So sets up the nation.  I wonder how we get to the bottom of what she...  What do you just start asking questions?  I'll do it.  Yeah.  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  No, I don't feel you to bitch out.  Hey, hypnotist dude.  Hypnotist dude.  I don't know his name still.  It's Don the Hypnotist.  Oh, Don the Hypnotist.  I'm sorry, Don.  You'll know what questions to ask Patty.  Yeah, but I'm going to let you guys also ask some questions as well.  You're lucky you caught him when he's not busy because he's got that gig in August in Arlington.  So he has plenty of time to get Patty done. 
[02:34:00]  Patty and most of the New Jersey tri-state area.  Yeah, we're going to get you a better booker there, Don.  There you go.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Or a booker.  Or a booker at this point.  Right.  All right.  Go.  Go do your thing.  Does hypnotism work?  I don't think so.  It's a pack of lies.  I saw Patty.  She's wearing some kind of, like, what would be hot on, like, girls.  Really?  With handcuffs?  Tough crowd.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys are a tough crowd.  We're going to take a break. 
[02:34:30]  GregProops.com.  ComicsNY.com.  With the X, as you spell comics, tonight and tomorrow at Comics, 14th and 9th.  Thank you.  All right.  It's a pretty intense stop, man.  If you do it, you will talk to intelligent beings from other dimensions.  For real.  All right.  We're preparing the studio for Stalker Patty.  We're going to try to make it comfortable in here, and we're hoping that we get some stuff out of Stalker Patty today. 
[02:35:00]  Because out of nowhere, we've known her for, I don't know, 10 years at this point.  And she started really opening up about her upbringing.  And some funny business was going on.  Definitely.  With her foster father, apparently.  She had told us little tidbits of her childhood, when she was about 13, 14, 15, around there, that whole age, where she'd be in the bathtub, taking the bath, and her foster father would come in and start shaving. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  And then, why would that be necessary to do that while she's bathing?  And then she would say, could you leave?  I feel uncomfortable.  And then the father would say something like, you're just a little girl.  Oh, stop.  Shut up.  Stop.  I've seen you before.  You're a little girl.  Yeah, this is fine.  And there was no shower curtain.  And where he shaved, there was a window, a mirror.  A mirror.  That looked right into the bathtub.  Yeah.  And she wondered why there was this mirror that was on the wall. 
[02:36:00]  Because the bathtub was kind of around a wall.  Right.  From the sink.  Right.  But there was a mirror right there where you could kind of look at the reflection and see the bathtub from the sink.  No one needs that type of mirror.  No.  Unless you're doing creepy stuff, I'm thinking.  Yep.  And then when she would have to sleep over at a place, she'd sleep on the couch with the foster father.  Right.  And sometimes his hand would kind of go around her. 
[02:36:30]  Yep.  And she would try to throw it off of her.  I mean, it's got all the earmarks of being molested.  But then she stopped.  She wouldn't go any further with her story.  So then we thought a hypnotist might get some stuff out of her, right?  Yep.  She says she doesn't remember whenever we want to dig a little deeper.  Right.  She goes, I don't remember.  I don't think.  She says that, too.  I don't think I was touched.  Yeah.  So we'll find out today, hopefully.  We're, uh... 
[02:37:00]  Where'd he go?  Oh.  Yeah, we're just trying to...  Okay.  What happened?  I don't know.  I just want Roland to...  Roland, you know, it's cool.  Roland, we're learning.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  Roland, he's not even here.  What do you want to say?  Roland, hypnotism doesn't work while you're on your BlackBerry.  No one just goes...  Roland is so paranoid that he's going to get hypnotized.  Like a hypnotist.  Jimmy, why don't you explain what happened?  Because during the break, Danny casually goes, maybe we could hypnotize Roland.  And Roland just basically said no. 
[02:37:30]  He didn't want to do it.  Right.  Basically said no.  Basically said no.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He said he didn't want to do it.  But it's like, we're not going to force you to be...  But it's like, he doesn't want to be here for it.  But it's like, hypnotism doesn't work that way.  It's not like all of a sudden, the guy says something magic.  You have to be in a room quietly.  Like, you know someone's trying to hypnotize.  So if you don't want to do it, you don't want to do it.  Maybe he's had a bad experience before, and like two days later, he's going to find himself  driving along, and all of a sudden, or whatever.  Yeah.  No.  That'll happen.  Are you that susceptible to power of suggestion?  No. 
[02:38:00]  Have you ever been mesmerized before?  Have you ever had a man's penis inside you unintentionally?  No.  You know, they're sealing up the room here with tape.  It's like Elvis' house in Memphis in the 70s.  Wouldn't they do that with aluminum foil?  They would cover everything up here.  Sure, but I love the psychopathic tape usage here, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like my father fixing something.  Cream pie, and the fucking maniac next to him is twitching with his head near the television  monitor.  It's very comforting.  Big Nazi helping.  Can I ask why we're darkening the windows in here? 
[02:38:30]  Just to try to get as comfortable as possible.  Because I'm getting a real Abu Garb feel from you guys right now.  Dude, if you want to break out your pot, no one's going to complain, because we don't  have a boss right now.  Mm-hmm.  How about you toke up live on our show today?  I have it with me.  I know you will answer.  What do you got, a little dugout or something?  What do you use?  No, I don't carry a dugout.  I'm not a cheap, cheap pisher.  I carry a pre-rolled gorgeous one at all times.  Jimmy, what were you getting at with the rolling thing?  Oh, nothing.  Just talking about it.  But Steve was supposed to come in, and he's downstairs getting... 
[02:39:00]  I know you're setting up something.  I know that.  Nothing.  I know, because I'm now frustrated, because I can see it in your face.  Something was supposed to happen there, right?  No, we were just talking about the hypnosis.  I don't...  And Steve is, uh...  Hmm.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Steve's watching me.  You might as well just blow it now, because it's...  Just a softball.  Just downstairs.  Look at Jimmy.  You don't want to do the big reveal? 
[02:39:30]  There really isn't one.  It's not a big deal.  It was just too...  What was Steve supposed to do?  Because now it's funnier that it didn't happen.  Just participate in the discussion, because I wanted to get his take on it.  Right.  And he's just...  And we have Roland in here.  We were just talking to him.  Yeah.  And then Steve's just downstairs.  What is he being queer?  What is Steve doing? 
[02:40:00]  He's getting Joel, because he had to.  Because Roland...  I said...  Look, let's send someone else down and grab Joel.  Right.  Because Roland was here.  He's a part of the discussion off-air, so I wanted him to at least be a part of it on-air.  Yeah.  And I wanted Steve to be a part of it.  Yeah.  Because he hasn't weighed in at all.  I don't know if he'd be a susceptible.  So I'm like, we should have somebody go get Joel McHale.  Right.  And I know Danny didn't know, so he sent Steve, but Steve knew that I wanted him in here.  So he's downstairs.  Oh.  I didn't know that Steve knew that.  You're not a mind reader.  I don't get what's going on, but I'm scared. 
[02:40:30]  No, no.  There's nothing bad, Roland.  There's nothing.  I'm not going to try to...  I did want to get to the little interaction between Danny and Roland, though.  That was...  That was funny.  Well, that's kind of what Steve would have been...  Oh, that's what...  Okay.  In a way, he would have been a part of that, like, weighing in with his opinion.  Right.  And, um...  And he's nowhere to be seen.  I ruin things.  He really does, though.  It's amazing.  Oh, I didn't know that you were... 
[02:41:00]  We have 30 people that work for this show.  Why does the quote...  And I say quote.  Executive producer have to go get the guests.  We have, like, 10 interns.  We got...  Mind-boggling.  I am here for you, B.  All right.  So, uh...  Danny goes, Roland, why don't you get hypnotized?  And what'd you say, Roland?  Fuck no.  He goes, fuck himself in the fuck hole.  I'll fucking...  I'll fuck his hair and come in his eye. 
[02:41:30]  That's what I said.  And it wouldn't be gay.  It's just...  It wouldn't be gay.  It'd just be angry.  You would just be very pissed off.  It would be angry.  That's Roland's defense mechanism.  Yeah.  It's not gay.  It's definitive.  Yeah.  No.  That's a very loud no.  And what about the dead dog thing you were saying?  No, just somebody at her office, she lost her dog, and I said...  I mocked her because I said, the dog hates you as much as I do.  Oof.  And you got in trouble at work?  Yeah.  It was just like, I would have to be more sensitive to her.  Her needs?  Yeah.  Chicks, man.  Sensitivity training? 
[02:42:00]  Almost.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we learned that Roland, like, you know, as a kid,  he was the kid that got his, what, your head in the toilet bowl every day?  Pretty much beat up.  Did they really put your head in the toilet?  Yeah.  Who did that?  Your brothers or your school?  No.  Um, school.  Because I wouldn't play football.  Because my brother was an all-star football player.  They wanted me to play football, but I was angry and spiteful to not play it.  Aw.  But I'm fine.  That's sad.  But they would slam your head into lockers and all this crap,  and then you finally said, you know what, fuck you all. 
[02:42:30]  I'm going to, like, start defending myself, right?  Yeah.  Snapped and became what I am today.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi-yo.  You're a nice guy, though.  Yeah.  He's really not.  He's just, when people piss me off, I'll snap and wish them death.  He really goes from zero to a hundred faster.  He goes from zero to a hundred faster than I've ever seen anyone.  There's no middle ground with him.  Nice, nice, nice.  I will kill you.  Major League anger.  Yeah.  He doesn't like being bullied and fucked with.  Right.  No. 
[02:43:00]  As opposed to the rest of us who enjoy it and actually pay for it on a sort of demi-monthly  basis.  Hey-o.  Yeah.  Why is Steven S. from Bayshore covering the windows?  Well, he's the honorary agent.  I just, I got a real American psycho feel from what's going on in here.  Something terrible.  Paper ring on the walls and...  We're about ready?  Coming up soon and...  What?  Steve is coming up now.  Is you Joel with him?  Yeah.  How long does it take to get a guest?  I don't know.  He left four minutes ago.  I had to stop. 
[02:43:30]  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  Can we fade the lights down a little bit on this side of the studio, too, please?  Oh, we don't know how to do that, either.  Yeah, we got dimmers.  Yeah, dimmers.  He's in these bed, boys, so we can get ready for the hypnotist.  Now, the hypnotist is in the other room preparing now.  Is that what's happening?  Yeah.  Preparing Patty.  Or he's just gone.  He might have left.  Yeah.  No, he's preparing Patty in the other room.  How about when the hypnotist comes in?  We all just attack him with hammers.  For having the nerve to perform in comedy clubs like hypnotists will do. 
[02:44:00]  They sell out, too.  It drives me nuts for an improv.  Who's that one guy that...  Flip Worley?  Yeah, Flip Worley.  Fucking cocksucker sells out everywhere.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He does mad business.  Is it good?  Apparently, he's great.  Well, I got to take less money each year just to come back to the same...  Yeah, it's embarrassing.  Really?  Well, I kind of like that vibe.  I got to add it hypnotizing to my act.  Yeah, let's go to Michael in Texas.  Michael!  Yeah, guys.  Last week, if you remember, Patty's mother knew three weeks prior to her first menstruation 
[02:44:30]  cycle that she was going to have it, which means she was ovulating at that time.  So, unless they've got a laboratory doing hormone tests on her blood in the basement,  somebody was messing around with her pussy and noticed a discharge.  Wow.  Wow.  Thank you, Doc.  What?  Jesus.  He sounded really smart until he said someone was messing with her pussy.  I got it.  You shot right in.  I don't know the average...  I don't think the average doctor says messing with her pussy.  Messing around with her pussy.  Until he said that, his pussy's not out the window. 
[02:45:00]  According to the Harvard Medical Journal...  I'm a doctor.  Yeah, Greg Proops got something.  Yes, Greg?  Well, I'm just saying, according to the Harvard Medical Journal, if your pussy's been messed  with, it's imperative to seek a physician's care.  Particularly if that shit's all fucked up, I believe is what they say.  All right, we got Don the hypnotist.  Oh, well, he's there.  Thumbs up or down?  What's the problem?  He's walking into the room.  Okay. 
[02:45:30]  We've lost a patient.  We'd like to get a little information on what has happened.  All right.  Don, what do we got?  I'm back.  How did things go?  Pretty much a hypnotic sponge.  Really?  Yeah.  She's good?  Oh, out like a light.  Oh, good.  And you just left her alone in there?  She's fine.  Oh, let's go molest her.  Could you just turn around and look at Roland in the eyes?  No.  I love how Roland thinks he can be hypnotized just kind of sitting there. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  I've seen movies and shit.  Hey, just start hypnotizing Roland right now.  Is Roland really want to go under?  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Just start.  Steve.  Watch this.  Watch this.  Go ahead.  Just start talking to him.  Just start talking to him.  Good joke.  I'll fuck you up if you try to fucking hypnotize me.  Wow.  Rough crowd here today.  No, I was just asking.  Hold on.  I'm not asking you to.  I was only asking Steve to weigh in.  Does a mic go there to let Roland have his mic?  Can you talk on that one? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  It's easy.  No, you're not always going to try to hypnotize me.  Well, he just asked if I'm going to be hypnotized.  I said politely.  I don't want to.  Yeah.  That's right.  All right.  Could you hypnotize him?  Let's Steve have that mic.  I want to hear Steve weigh in.  Yeah.  Steve?  Steve?  Steve?  Steve?  What's the matter, Roland?  Comment.  I don't want to be hypnotized.  What?  Are you convinced that you're going to be hypnotized if somebody looks at you the wrong way?  I don't know.  Roland, that's not the way it works, Roland.  I don't know.  Just chill.  It doesn't work that way.  You don't have to be so nervous. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, that doesn't help.  He won't look at him.  That's so funny.  Just look at the hypnotist.  Dude, you can make eye contact.  Just look into his eyes there.  Roland.  Over there.  Over there.  Okay.  Over there.  I'll cancel dark night screening for everybody.  All right.  Well, now he's, you know, now he's crossing the line.  Now he's crossing the line, right.  No.  All right.  We got Joel McHale from, uh.  Oh, Joel.  From, uh, The Soup.  Hi.  Come on, Roland.  Makes better radio.  I'll give you a hundred bucks.  No.  I'm scared.  What are you scared of? 
[02:47:30]  What could happen?  I don't know.  Roland, how about if we, like, set boundaries?  Like, we don't make you do gay stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Unless it's funny.  Unless it's funny, right?  Or appropriate.  Yeah, I trust you guys.  No.  I mean, how about if you believe your clothes are actually owned?  Well.  Hmm.  I mean.  No.  No.  Wait.  You gotta look at him when you're answering his question.  Just look at him.  I'm not.  What would you be embarrassed about if your clothes came off?  I mean, you have a great body. 
[02:48:00]  My, I don't know.  I'm paranoid.  I'm paranoid?  You really are scared.  All right.  Well, before Patty wakes up, we should start, right?  Yeah.  I'll have a break coming in here.  Where would you like her to sit?  This is off right now.  What's up, Danny?  I'm going to turn off the...  No, I was just saying, I guess we should, we can move Joel over there and get down a seat.  Sure.  Okay.  Everything's not so awkward.  All right.  Yeah.  Get up.  Okay.  Danny's doing a good job organizing everybody.  How are you, Joel?  Nice to meet you.  All right.  Joel McHale's going in, what, Caroline's this weekend? 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  All shows are sold out.  They just added a Sunday show at 10.30 p.m.  Yeah.  Boy, get ready for disappointment.  This is...  If I had an act, I'm sure it would be...  Yeah.  You just book it and hope people don't notice you don't have an act?  Yeah.  Well, there's going to be a teleprompter right in front of my face the whole time.  That would be really fucking funny.  A comedian that just uses a teleprompter.  Yeah.  It would be so much easier.  Wouldn't it?  You just get off a red eye, right? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  I am...  Come by and say hi.  I'm upside down right now.  Yeah.  That's always fun doing that one.  Do you sleep on the plane?  It was that rough, horrible sitting up sleeping where you can't...  I didn't...  I wasn't...  It was horrible.  There's no getting comfortable.  There's no getting comfortable.  Do you itch on planes?  I itch.  You itch?  My legs itch.  Really?  I don't know if it's the Dramamine I take.  Oh, probably yes.  But I itch.  My whole body gets...  I want to jump out of my fucking skin.  Do you hear voices when they serve the food?  Do you hear like the voices that aren't on the intercom? 
[02:49:30]  Wait, what plane were you on that served food?  Yeah, they don't serve food anymore.  I don't serve anything now.  What airline did you take?  American.  You weren't in first class or anything?  No, are you kidding?  I work for E.  Oh.  Business?  E sent you out to Caroline's?  Wait.  No, I paid for it myself.  It was an e-git issue by E Channel.  They're thrilled that I'm here because it's promoting, you know, E programs, but they're  not going to pay for that.  No.  They play coach?  They would pay for that other dude that works for E. 
[02:50:00]  Mr. Seacrest?  Mr. Seacrest would get the first class.  Yes.  He would have a jet with a water bed in it.  We have to talk quietly because we have a party.  It's so calm and restful in here and cold and cooling.  Yeah.  It's like a meatlock.  We have to speak quietly.  All right.  Patty has entered the studio with Don.  Somebody hold the mic by Patty.  All right.  She's back.  All right.  Dan is setting up some microphones.  So we can capture Patty's voice as she talks about her past, which we have delved into 
[02:50:30]  a bit.  Zach, uh, Hailer, when if he sinks this, it is a quarter of a million dollar pot here.  We, uh, we talked to Patty without the use of a hypnotist, and she did say that she may,  um, from what she said, we, we are presuming that she may have been touched inappropriately  by her foster father.  Um, now she is under hypnosis, and we're going to see if we could delve a little deeper into  her psyche.  And, uh, have you guys thought about doing the whole show like this? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, I'm really, I'd say my voice.  It's great.  I can't tell if I'm talking, but this is my inner monologue.  Yeah.  It is a little weird.  Actually, you're all hypnotized.  Patty, how do you feel?  I'm relaxed.  Feel pretty relaxed?  Her microphone's been hypnotized.  Since you're being off.  Yes.  There it goes.  Okay.  No, it's all right.  Uh, Patty, just look at me.  Take a deep breath.  And a nice close sleep.  Deep sleep.  All the way down deep.  All right. 
[02:51:30]  I wish I could, I wish you were on the plane with me.  Yeah, it's great in the bar.  Me too.  She's there.  Yeah.  Okay.  So how do we get her to...  What?  Well, we want to talk about...  We want to take her back.  Okay.  Take her back until, uh, when she was about...  The Civil War.  Yes.  When she was about 13, 14, around those years.  Okay.  And, um...  She's on a sofa, maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  Should we ask basic questions about her upbringing and then get to that point? 
[02:52:00]  Maybe you're right.  Yeah.  Just to get a basic general knowledge of her upbringing.  Because I don't, I don't mean, I don't know enough about her life, so...  I'll just picture the worst tragedy ever.  Multiply it 80 times.  Yes.  And then you'll get close.  All right.  Now, Patty, take a deep breath.  Let it up very slowly.  Great.  Just relax.  I'm just going to pick up one of your hands.  I'm just going to drop it in your lap.  And you're just going to sink down even farther.  Just relax.  Sleep.  Deep sleep.  Good.  Now, Patty, what I'd like you to do is I want you to think back. 
[02:52:30]  I want you to go all the way back to when you were about 12 or 13.  The Jurassic era.  I want you to go all the way back to when you were 13.  And I want you to think right now, when you were 13, about what your happiest moment was  when you were 13.  And on the count of three, I want you to keep your eyes closed.  I just want you to tell us about what your happiest moment was when you were 13.  The fall of the Kaiser.  So, one, two, and three. 
[02:53:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't really have a happy 13.  Okay.  At what age can you remember when you had your happiest moment?  I'm eight years old and playing with my friends and not caring about anything.  We're running around the backyard.  Okay.  Good.  Good.  Thank you, Lassie. 
[02:53:30]  Running around the backyard.  Yeah, what makes you happy about that?  Well, all my people, all the girls, little girls I'm playing with, there's Laura, there's  Mary, the same age as me, and there's her little sister, Gracie, and we're all playing together.  And we're forgetting about everything.  Sounds like a vaudeville act.  We're just playing with each other.  We see a baby bird in the tree.  We try to save it.  You know, keep it away from the cat.  And we almost catch it, but the baby bird suddenly starts to hop away because it could 
[02:54:00]  fly a little.  And we're happy that the baby bird was able to fly away.  And I just remember that especially.  This isn't a bird, and it wasn't a cat.  Very slowly.  This is awesome.  Great.  Now, what I'd like you to do is I want you to tell me, at that point, who were you living  with?  My foster parents.  And what were their names?  Emily and Bill.  Okay.  And did you like your foster parents?  No. 
[02:54:30]  What didn't you like about them?  They didn't like me.  They made me feel like I was different.  How?  Well, I had a mother that was mentally ill, and I had a lot of nervous habits and quirks,  you know, I would, if I was alone, I would play by talking to myself and fantasizing,  you know, little things like, I don't know, being in another place or at a dance or something 
[02:55:00]  like that.  You know, I made up a family, you know, like, of people, like, based on my Barbie and Ken  dolls, you know, and me wearing high heels because I wanted to be a big teenager.  And I was, you know, I saw the big teenagers.  I wanted to be just like them.  So, I would talk to myself and act out the whole scenario, but aloud.  Now, was one of the kids in the family named Jimmy, by any chance?  Jimmy?  No.  Okay, great.  Just checking. 
[02:55:30]  Take a deep breath.  Let it out very slowly.  Great.  Now, what I want you to do is I want you to think about now, the same age with your foster  parents, and think about what in particular did you not like about your foster mother  and your foster father?  Is there a specific event?  They're very insecure, and one day, you know, I got a phone call from my natural mother, Virginia, 
[02:56:00]  who just wanted to hear my voice.  So, I talked to her, and she had me talking to her aunt, and I didn't know I had an aunt.  I was fascinated and having fun talking to them, and my foster mother seemed to be mad,  like agitated.  And then she, when I hung up, she says, do you want to live with her, or would you rather  live with me?  I says, well, being, I was only 12, I think, you know, and I was confused.  So, I said, my natural mother, because children want to be with their normal parents, you know, 
[02:56:30]  with their regular parents that they're related to.  So, I said her.  She took to her bed.  She started crying.  She told me what an ungrateful child I was, how bad I was, and this and that.  And then I got upset and ran to my room crying because I didn't understand where they were  coming from, and I thought I said the right answer.  So, maybe I said the wrong answer and should have said I preferred her, but it would have  been a lie, you know, because I hated her. 
[02:57:00]  I mean, why wouldn't any kid want to be with their normal parent, with their regular blood  parents, you know?  Isn't that normal?  Well, but at that age, I thought I was saying the right thing.  Why didn't you like the mother?  So, that upset and confused me, and afterwards, it made me not want to know my natural mother  at all, and later on, I tried to avoid her.  I thought there was something bad, you know, and my foster mother, I hated her, too.  I guess I didn't like anybody then, you know. 
[02:57:30]  Okay, and sleep, deep sleep, sleep, deep sleep.  I want you to remember now the same age you're at, and I want you to talk about your foster  father.  What is it you did not like about him?  Any specific events now?  I had a lot of breathing problems at that age, and he smoked and smoked cigars, and he  would blow the smoke in my room, and it would irritate my breathing, and I tried to object 
[02:58:00]  to it.  My natural brother almost died of asthma at seven, and I didn't like that, plus he stunk  of smoking and stuff, and I was especially sensitive to it.  He was also very old-fashioned, and thought I was a little girl.  He would walk into the bathroom when I was 12, and I didn't like that.  I wanted my privacy, you know, I think that was normal, and I felt embarrassed, you know. 
[02:58:30]  I wasn't really developed yet at 12, but he just kept walking in, and kept walking out  doing his business, you know, shaving and stuff, and he acted like I was seven years old  and in the tub, and I resented that.  They didn't want me to grow up, I guess.  I don't know.  Did he ever look at her on the tub?  Now, when your foster father would come in, would he look at you?  Would he in any way do anything that was inappropriate? 
[02:59:00]  I don't remember.  I just know that he looked at me, and I felt embarrassed when he looked, and he had an unconcerned  look on his face like it was nonchalant, and that confused me, because when I watched  TV, children and people, adults go to the bathroom, children go to the bathroom, you  know, they do their showering, but their door is always closed to the bathroom.  Now, the family members stay outside, but it wasn't like it was on TV. 
[02:59:30]  He just walked in and out like it was normal, and my foster mother would, too, you know, and  I didn't understand that.  And they also got upset when I wanted to wash my hair more than a couple of times a week.  It was during the water shortage, but I wanted to wash my hair so that I could be more like  normal girls my age, with shiny, nice hair, and then when I wanted to take a bath every  day, they got upset with that, too, but I wanted to take a bath every day, so I ended up 
[03:00:00]  maybe taking a bath twice a week or something, because they didn't want me to take a bath every  day, and I didn't understand that.  Wow.  Something about a bath.  There was a bath.  So it was like they didn't want me to be like other teenagers, I guess, or just develop  maybe take a shower.  I don't know.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Never.  And then they were so convinced I was going to end up like my mother, and I didn't want  to end up like that.  All right, take a deep breath, and let it up very slowly. 
[03:00:30]  Great.  Now, other than the bathroom incident with your stepfather, was there any other incidents  that made you feel uncomfortable?  All right, start jerking, guys.  Stage red.  Yeah, they kept wanting me to go with them shopping, and I wanted to be with my friends,  and they wouldn't allow me to stay home. 
[03:01:00]  That's hot.  Like other kids my age would probably be allowed to do.  You guys going to go to the game?  Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong with a 12, 13, 14-year-old wanting to stay home.  They wanted me with them at all times, but then they would make us sit in the car for  three, four hours, even from the time I was little, alone, and nobody there, and they  would just do their shopping.  Get in there, Doc.  I'm losing my rod.  My foster brother was there.  He would get agitated.  He would start hitting me. 
[03:01:30]  I'm in a small area.  I can't get out, and I'm trying to fight him off, and he was a little troubled himself.  He had a problem.  He wanted to use his fist a lot, and I was the nearest target, and I had bruises and  stuff.  I would try to show them, and they would just poo-poo the idea, and he was their darling  angel, I guess because he almost died, so he was their angel, and I was the pariah or  something, and he was abusing me by hitting me, and I didn't like being hit. 
[03:02:00]  I think the brother, yeah.  And they would say, you're 11 months older than him.  Can you get her to act like a chicken or something?  I'd beat her, too.  You know, I wanted to stick to the dead man in the middle of the world, and that's  going to be a murderer or something.  What street is that on?  Thanks for asking.  He used to growl like an animal.  535.  And 2th Avenue.  2-3-8-2-3-8-9.  But they sent me to the mental doctors.  830 and 1045. 
[03:02:30]  2-9.  The whole family would have a doctor for me, and they thought I had all the problems,  and he didn't have any.  Do you live in L.A. or do you live in New York?  I live in L.A.  You live in L.A.  You live in L.A.  You live in L.A., yeah.  Of course, you have to.  It's amazing.  It's not being hit by this kid.  Oh, she's talking about the devil of faith.  I don't want to be hit by anybody.  I don't want to be hit or hurt by anyone, physically.  God.  She got out of it.  I just fell out yesterday.  Doc, you got to ask about them starving them.  Ask about sleeping with the father when they went away. 
[03:03:00]  And relax.  Take a deep breath.  Did you take a day flight?  Very slowly.  Did they say that?  Now, what I'd like you to do is I want you to think back.  You did.  I was American.  It was nice.  You had said in the past that your foster father would possibly sleep in the same room  or bed with you.  Can you think about that and tell us what happened now?  I wanted to have my own place to sleep when I was at my auntie's house in Massachusetts.  Auntie. 
[03:03:30]  I wanted to be alone.  You know, I didn't want to sleep with anybody.  I didn't like being touched.  And then I had to lay next to him, you know?  I think the best thing I did was I wet the bed.  I remember wetting the bed.  I was like in such a deep sleep.  I guess I couldn't get up to go to the bathroom or something.  So I wet the bed.  That wasn't her.  We had to change the entire couch and everything.  Wet the bed with white goopy stuff.  I kind of felt good about that.  I don't know. 
[03:04:00]  Maybe I was getting back at him or something.  Did she do that to keep him away from her?  I didn't feel comfortable sleeping next to a grown man.  And I wanted to be by myself.  But I wasn't like 12, 13, 14 years old.  I didn't feel that was normal, but I couldn't explain it or understand why.  All he knows that I wanted to sleep by myself.  What did he do that made her feel so uncomfortable about it?  And how often would this happen?  Every time we went away to sleep overnight at her house in Massachusetts. 
[03:04:30]  Whose house?  She didn't have that much in the way of space, I guess.  Now, whose house was this?  Auntie Margaret's house.  How old was she when they were sleeping together?  And how old were you when this was happening?  I was all ages, you know, like us.  But I especially, I was, I guess when I'm 5, 6, 7 years old, it's one thing.  But then when I hit like 12 or 13, I felt self-conscious. 
[03:05:00]  Because I guess because I was changing or something inside, you know.  Changing or not mentally.  So what does she remember about sleeping on the couch?  What does she smell?  No.  Now, what do you remember exactly about sleeping on the couch?  I was uncomfortable.  There was no room to move around and I couldn't spread out.  And he was taking up three quarters of the space because he was bigger than me. 
[03:05:30]  I'm starting to think she's just whining.  And when he put his arm around my head, you know, like in a circular motion,  like the arm in a circle arc or something, I was especially uncomfortable.  That made me, you know, because I smelled him, you know, the smokey wool over him and everything.  And he had horrible breath.  I didn't like it.  I wanted to get away from him.  Eric Nagel's grandfather.  So what would she smell his breath? 
[03:06:00]  How would she smell his breath?  Yeah.  Now, right now, can you actually picture the smell that you would smell right now?  Yeah, a mixture of cigar smoke and smoking and, you know, musty tight smell.  I don't know.  Romance smell, I guess.  I don't know.  Musty.  Very musty.  Ew.  Oh, she smells like...  Now, when this happened, were you fully clothed? 
[03:06:30]  Yes, I was.  I had my pajamas on.  What did he kiss her on the cheek tonight from behind?  How would he kiss her?  I always wore flannel pajamas.  Of course you did.  They were little girl-type pajamas, you know, but that little animals on them and stuff  like that, little designs.  Sure, I remember.  What is with a flap in the back?  No.  No.  No.  They weren't that old.  Would he kiss her goodnight?  Now, would your foster father, would he kiss you goodnight? 
[03:07:00]  No, he wouldn't, but he snored, too.  I remember the snoring, and I hated that, too.  Did he ever pull her back closer to him to keep her from falling off the couch?  I take a deep breath.  Let it out very slowly.  Great.  Yes, let's break the tension and bring Bill.  Let's bring Bill back out.  Let's bring him out.  We've got your stepfather right here. 
[03:07:30]  Now, let me ask you something.  If your foster father were right here, right now in front of you, what would you say to him?  I would say, uh, leave me alone.  I'm old enough to be on my own.  Get back in the grave.  You've been dead for years.  I'm not your little girl anymore.  I'm older now.  I'm different.  I'm a woman. 
[03:08:00]  I'm not a little girl anymore.  Being hypnotized on the radio.  Don't act like I'm seven.  Hey, Doc.  Doc, I should go home.  No, and also, uh, the fact that he was so old-fashioned and strict and, uh, good Catholic and stuff, right?  She's a virgin, by the way.  You know, I disagreed with his feelings about different things, you know?  We should make believe that she's not a virgin.  Like going to a dance.  Never talk about all the cocks. 
[03:08:30]  She just sucked.  You know, why did he feel the need to bring me to a dance and make me stand outside on the steps obedient  so he could go in and take a look around.  What was the problem?  This whiny bitch is like an annoying piss out of me.  Most of the girls were dropped off and went to the dance, and that was it.  We'll get something out of this, trust me.  Don, ask why she's uptight about sex.  And then we've got to turn it and make her believe she really is an virgin and that she's very, she's a slut.  She said that there were drug addicts in the trees and they would jump down on me and attack me. 
[03:09:00]  So they wouldn't let me go with my eighth grade religion class and go to Dataf Village.  And I thought it would be good for my education.  I thought it would be an awesome experience.  Where was that club, on 14th Street?  It's called Comics.  Two shows tonight, two shows tomorrow.  Were you at Caroline's?  Yes.  But all your shows are sold out, right?  Yeah, I have Sunday shows.  I'm beautiful.  It's amazing.  She's talking about being beaten, and we're disappointed she wasn't raped.  We're assholes. 
[03:09:30]  I don't know how disappointed.  Wait, where are we going, Don?  When I snap my fingers, you're Arba Dwyer.  All right, we're going forward to the present time.  Okay.  Let's take a deep breath, let it up very slowly.  Do you think it's too early for lunch, or is it still breakfast before?  I haven't had breakfast.  Yeah.  Now, Patty, I want you to think about what is your favorite thing about sex?  What's your favorite thing on the count of three?  One, two, and three.  Running from gym.  Making yourself look pretty, you know, and falling in love, I guess, you know, with the right person. 
[03:10:00]  You know, and looking good for that person.  How does she make herself look pretty?  Now, how do you make yourself look pretty?  Besides Halloween masks.  Oh, well, um, if I was going on a date, do you mean?  No, stupid.  If you were testifying before Congress.  Wish for the money to go and get your nails done. 
[03:10:30]  And my hair washed and styled.  And, uh, get a nice dress to put on.  Styled by a Lee Harvey Oswald.  You know, a brand new, expensive dress, I guess.  I don't know.  Because, you know, I want to look good for this person.  Are you sure you can't make her act like a chicken?  No.  My barber's sir.  I'm sorry.  Looking attractive.  Can you hypnotize her to be less wordy?  Yes.  Yes.  For post-contact.  This sucks, because that was my whole act. 
[03:11:00]  What the fuck am I going to do tonight?  Burned to the ground.  You can use my telepron for that.  However, you're going to realize that last week, last week, you actually had sex for the  first time.  You're here to tell everyone about it.  It was the most amazing thing on the count of three.  So, one, two, and three. 
[03:11:30]  Well, I feel liberated.  I feel free.  I feel like I'm normal, I guess.  You know, and it's with somebody I loved.  What color was he?  I don't know.  And who was this?  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Colin Ferguson.  I don't know.  It's got to be an imaginary person.  I don't have a person or anybody right now. 
[03:12:00]  I don't know.  All the way down deep.  Take a deep breath.  It happens very slowly.  It's not happy normal.  Boom.  All right.  I'm going to make it from one to three.  When I say the number three, when I say the number three,  to remain in this room.  Relaxed state.  Remain in this relaxed state.  And anytime, anytime, I want you to think about, 
[03:12:30]  again, the happiest moment you've had,  the happiest moment in your life.  I want you to think about that in your mind.  I'll put that away.  Exactly.  You're back in the present time.  Can you make her squeeze her tits?  Like, whatever she thinks of something,  she just squeezes her tits,  but doesn't know she's doing it.  On the count from one to three,  when I say the number three, 
[03:13:00]  you're actually going to open your eyes.  It'll be a little bit difficult to do,  but you'll be able to open your eyes.  You'll realize that anytime you see Jimmy touch his nose,  that your breasts are talking to you.  They're telling the funniest jokes you have ever heard in your entire life.  Anytime you see Jimmy touch his nose.  On the count of three.  One, two, three.  Her tits are going to be at comics.  No, they're not on at comics.  Friday and Saturday.  Is she opening now?  Come on.  Her tits are opening.  Did it work or no?  What?  My neck?  No, I have arthritis in my neck. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, good.  But did the hypnosis work or no?  Did what?  Did the hypnosis work or no?  No.  I don't know.  What?  Nothing.  I don't know.  Why are you laughing?  I'm just trying to figure out if the hypnosis worked or if it didn't.  It worked.  I was very relaxed. 
[03:14:00]  Because I tried it once and I couldn't fall asleep.  I did.  Would you fall asleep?  Yeah.  Could you make her cry instead?  Yeah, please.  Could you make her tits itch every time I touched my nose?  Why?  Thank you.  Could you make her breasts really itch?  Please make her tits itch?  And I was supposed to sleep, deep sleep. 
[03:14:30]  All the way down deep sleep.  Put her in a deep sleep like RFK in the kitchen.  Yes.  She got your pots and pans and get the nomination.  And then make a boom and fall down.  In the moment, I'm going to count for one to three.  When I say the number three, you'll open your eyes.  You'll realize not only when Jimmy rubs his nose, does it make you laugh.  You'll realize each and every time he does it, your breasts are growing.  At two to three inches each and every time, they're getting just huge.  On the count of three.  One, two, and three. 
[03:15:00]  That's it.  Do you feel relaxed at all or no?  I feel good.  I couldn't be put under.  I tried to, but I couldn't do it.  I mean, I tried to, but I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, it was...  She's pushing her chest forward every time, Jimmy.  What's the matter?  She touches his nose.  Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything okay?  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  What are you looking at, Patty?  Oh, my God.  Patty, what are you doing?  No.  What's happening?  Could you do it wherever I rub my nose?  She says something interesting.  Holy shit.  She is the dullest thing.  She kept looking at her chest.  She's a virgin.  She was abused.  And we can't get anything good out of her. 
[03:16:00]  We should all be fucking killed.  You feel tightness?  Yeah, I want to be...  How many hours have you guys been at this?  Oh, my God.  It seems like time.  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Are you feeling...  You're not feeling good?  No, no.  I just feel very tight.  Where?  Like, my clothes are tight.  Oh.  Well, why don't you take them off?  Yeah, you want to take off?  It can't be.  And then what I'm wearing is my size,  so I don't know why I feel so tight.  Where does it feel tight?  I don't know if it's your size.  Around my chest area.  I'm tight. 
[03:16:30]  You want to take your clothes off, or...?  No, not really.  Well, you got big boobs.  We want to see them.  I don't.  I don't.  Holy shit.  Could you hypnotize her into improving?  Someone should fucking just set the studio on fire and kill all of us.  What affects your breathing?  What does?  What does?  By the way, the studio looks tremendous. 
[03:17:00]  I haven't been here since the remote.  The way it feels, you know?  What affects your breathing?  Yeah.  The entire show, bombing at once?  Really?  She has given us nothing.  It's amazing.  Great.  You could have fucking brought an aardvark in and just walked around,  and it would have been more interesting.  Aardvarks are weird.  This is the greatest hypnotist ever, though,  because the whole audience out there is asleep.  Absolutely.  You've done a million people in two countries.  Congratulations. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Did you make her think she's Terry Schiavo?  Whoa.  I think that's already happened.  What do you got, Don?  Deep breath.  Very slowly.  Please make her a chicken.  Please make her a chicken.  Pardon, mister?  That's a chicken for, like, two minutes.  This is just going to end with us having to make her a chicken.  How about this?  Every time I talk, every time I talk, she has a deep inner ass itch. 
[03:18:00]  Please tell her that she has a deep, like, her ass is torn,  and the skin is knitting itself back together,  and the itch is maddening.  Could you describe it more, though?  That's soft skin in between her cheeks,  and she has to scratch it.  Tell her that none of us can see her scratch it.  That's right.  I'm just going to count from one to three.  When I say the number three,  you'll realize that any time that Jimmy talks,  you're going to feel this itch exactly where you're sitting. 
[03:18:30]  It is absolutely incredible.  The only thing is nobody else knows about it but you,  and it's just going to be incredible.  Incredible itch.  It just won't stop.  You won't be able to stop moving.  On the count of three, open your eyes.  One, two, and three eyes out.  So, uh, we're going to start right off with a bang, huh?  Yeah, we're going to talk to Patty today there, Jimmy.  Okay.  Patty, what's going on? 
[03:19:00]  Nothing.  Huh?  What are you doing?  I'm not doing it.  I'm just trying to get comfortable, that's all.  We gave you a good chair.  Are you not comfortable with that chair?  Not nice chair in the place.  I'm comfortable.  You're squirming pretty bad.  Right?  Huh?  Why are you scratching your back?  No, I'm not squirming.  Okay, you all right?  I'm just spacking, really.  What?  We tried to get you a comfortable chair.  Is the chair not comfortable enough for you?  Yeah, it's all right.  Just feel like a... 
[03:19:30]  I'd rather smell that finger than do any more of this show.  Yeah, you're moving around a lot.  Um, is there any way that we could, uh...  It's just the back of the chair, I don't know.  You have a lot of dry skin.  Patty, you're moving around a lot.  You all right?  Yeah, fine.  Why are you moving so much?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, do you feel like...  Do you not like the chair that we gave you?  Would you want another chair?  Oh, I like the chair.  I guess I must be hot in the back of it or something. 
[03:20:00]  No, you're not.  It's pretty cool in here.  Yeah, we're pretty comfortable.  Why are you itching yourself?  That's weird.  No, it's all right.  Did you take a hot shower?  Yeah.  I don't know, for some reason.  My back itches.  I wish I had a back scratch.  Okay, how about this?  Can we change this a little bit?  So she thinks that every time she hears my voice,  her clit is being stung by a bumblebee.  There's a bug on her clit. 
[03:20:30]  Hey, nice, close sleep.  Yeah, Don, we need the big finish.  All the way down to the big finish.  The big finish.  We need something.  We'd like the beginning, too.  Finish.  Finish gives you the impression that something had happened prior to it.  Holy shit.  This is horrible.  All right, in a moment of count from one to three,  when I say the number three,  you'll open your eyes. 
[03:21:00]  The remaining is very large.  The whole studio should be dropped out of the bottom of the Enola gate.  Any time you hear Jimmy talk,  any time you hear Jimmy talk,  it'll be as if there's a little bug,  a little bug,  and he's crawling around right on your clit.  It's incredible.  On the count of three,  one, two, three, eyes open.  Patty,  so what do you think?  Interesting so far.  What is?  Very interesting. 
[03:21:30]  But I mean,  has the experience been good for you,  or has it not been good for you?  I would say it's beneficial.  You look uncomfortable.  Is the chair comfortable?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Okay, we just want to make sure that the, uh,  the chair is comfortable,  because I see your legs kicking out.  I just want to make sure that everything is comfortable.  We wanted you to relax.  Yeah, you don't look like you're relaxing, Patty.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, you kind of look like you're going through Brigham Mortis.  No, I just feel weird. 
[03:22:00]  Why? What's the matter?  How do you feel weird?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't tell you.  I don't know.  Wait, what's the matter?  What's wrong?  What do you mean you feel weird?  I don't know.  Do you feel interesting?  Patty, what are you doing?  Looks like you're trying to rub your...  You look very concerned.  Why do you look so concerned?  Tell us what's going on, Patty.  I don't know.  What is that?  I wish I could go to the bathroom for a minute.  Why? 
[03:22:30]  Oh, my God.  Why do you want to go to the bathroom for a minute?  We're in the middle of doing something.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I just feel uncomfortable.  Why?  In what way?  What feels uncomfortable on you?  I don't know.  Is it all the canceled subscriptions in the last hour?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Okay.  How about...  How about she lost her virginity to Jimmy? 
[03:23:00]  She thought Jimmy loved her.  But Jimmy was just using her.  Using her and her pussy.  And she's not happy about it.  And that's close to sleep.  Wait, will she?  Deep sleep.  All the way down deep.  Relaxing.  Easy target.  All the way down deep.  We're awful.  I'll give you that.  Hey, can you hypnotize us into being talented? 
[03:23:30]  That would be great.  Shit stains.  Take a deep breath.  Let it out very slowly.  If you listen closely, you could hear Elo saying, just in time.  Just relax.  Just relax.  Now, in a moment, let me count from one to three.  When I say the number three, you'll open your eyes, remaining in this very relaxed state.  Remaining very relaxed.  You'll realize, though, that last night, you and Jimmy had unbelievable sex last night.  Unbelievable.  You're here to tell everybody what happened.  There were unbelievable sex acts involving all sorts of things. 
[03:24:00]  On the count of three.  One, two, and three.  Eyes open.  I know.  Unbelievable.  We got Patty in the studio today to talk about last night.  Finally.  Patty.  Nice.  Wow, Patty.  I didn't know you were such a goer.  Why are you laughing, Patty?  The most ridiculous thing.  Oh, Jimmy's dick.  Wow. 
[03:24:30]  I'm sorry it wasn't functional.  Patty, what happened last night?  Well, he took me out, went to the comedy club, and I saw the whole set, including him,  and then we went home to his apartment on the Upper West Side.  Wow.  Moving on up.  Could you hypnotize me into that crying?  And then what happened?  He brought you into his apartment? 
[03:25:00]  Well, yeah.  It's a nice one.  Sure.  It's very impeccably clean.  I don't know what, you know.  Describe his apartment.  Yeah.  I guess he has other people do it for him.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Not whites.  The floors are perfect in everything, too.  Right.  Yeah.  And anyway, since I was a virgin, I never did it before.  I was very gentle at first.  I see. 
[03:25:30]  You know, and...  It was flaccid.  Then we started chasing each other and stuff.  I don't know.  Chasing each other?  I don't remember.  Tell me, because I was kind of tired.  I don't know, Jim.  You don't even drink.  I know.  I don't know.  All I know is that we were just playing tag with each other and everything.  It was a lot of...  Playing tag?  I guess so.  I don't know.  The body that I was waving a hammer.  This is her impression of what sex is like.  We were playing tag.  Like they're running around chasing each other. 
[03:26:00]  Remember I finally called you?  Yes, you did.  What happened?  I don't know.  It was on the floor.  Oh, on the floor.  I'm a little embarrassed to talk about it.  Well, go ahead.  You're among friends.  You're among friends, Ricky.  Did he rip your clothes off?  Yeah.  What kind of wild things happened?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just had some soft moments, you know.  What kind of soft moments?  Oh, Jim.  Very...  See, Alice, look into it. 
[03:26:30]  It was very gentle.  What?  Yeah, but what...  Like, give us some details.  What do you remember about the kissing?  I thought the kissing was nice.  Yeah, I mean...  What was the nickname that Jim wanted you to call him?  Yeah.  All night.  I don't remember any nicknames.  Just Jimmy.  Absent.  You know, there's no nickname.  I don't think he even has a nickname.  Did you like the kissing, though?  And the little neck kissing?  Yeah.  It was nice.  It's okay.  It was fun. 
[03:27:00]  Does Jimmy have a big piece?  What?  Does he have a big penis?  Come on.  It's all right.  Don't be embarrassed.  Average size.  Average.  You know.  Sorry, whore.  You know.  Size queen.  Exactly.  What positions did you guys do?  Well, I don't know.  Missionary.  And then side by side.  And then I was on top.  Yeah.  Wow.  Riding cowboy.  Riding cowboy.  Wow.  Did you like that one the best?  I remember you liked that one because I could do a little nipple play, which you kind of 
[03:27:30]  like.  It was nice.  Yeah.  So then when Biff Tannen ripped you out of the car.  Yeah.  It wasn't too long, though.  It didn't last too long, though.  You know.  How could it?  And then he said goodnight.  Dick ran away.  Got me into a taxi.  Let's put her in back to the future.  I know.  So the sex didn't last that long?  No, it didn't.  I don't know.  Do you remember what you said when you came?  Oh.  I'd rather put her in the shiny.  Looking for daddy.  I don't know.  I just relaxed and took it all in. 
[03:28:00]  I didn't say very much.  You took it all?  No.  It was very quiet.  Where did he come?  Was it inside your pussy, in your mouth, or your ass?  I don't know.  He was wearing protection.  Yeah.  Where was it, though?  Was it in your mouth?  No.  We didn't do anything like that, no.  Why not?  To me, that's kind of disgusting, so I won't do stuff like that.  But you were wild last night.  Finally, you got me.  I'm not really into the oral things, so I didn't want that. 
[03:28:30]  No?  But Jimmy went down on you, right?  Oh, yeah.  That's all right.  You didn't reciprocate, you fucking selfish bitch.  I know you're embarrassed, but don't be embarrassed.  Let's talk about it a little bit.  Yeah, let's talk about it.  How did it feel, Patty?  It was okay.  Okay?  It was fun.  Jimmy, you suck.  No, it was fun.  I had fun, and I felt good, too.  From one to ten, what would you give Jimmy as far as his...  I'd give him a nine and a half. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, all right.  Wow.  Almost the perfect score.  What could he do to get that extra half?  What could he have done?  I don't know.  You know?  I don't know.  Been another person.  I don't know if that made me feel weird.  And I was a little taken aback at first, you know?  Oh, you took it in the back?  He'd flip you over?  I said taken aback.  Hold on, though.  I was wondering.  But Anthony brings up something good, because Jimmy was telling us that he did try to have 
[03:29:30]  some of that air sex with you.  Yeah.  What was that all about?  Remember you had to poop?  You wouldn't...  Yeah.  Well, I think that would hurt me.  So that's why...  Remember I pushed a little bit.  So you wouldn't let me do it.  I tried to push a little bit.  The ears are shit falling out of that thing.  It ain't gonna hurt.  It hurts.  It ain't gonna hurt.  I didn't want to do that.  Yeah, but I pushed a little bit, and you were afraid it made you have to go to the bathroom.  I guess, you know.  That's all right.  You said that to me.  I just wasn't comfortable with that.  Well, you said that to me.  Don't do that or I'll shit on your cock.  I didn't say that. 
[03:30:00]  I don't remember saying that.  Well, you should not drink so much, then.  Should we put it under the air?  Something's too late to feel uncomfortable.  I don't think it's normal.  I don't know.  No.  All right.  One more.  One more thing, and then...  Sure, why not?  One more gem.  One more gem in this fucking...  When did the Peabody Awards get handed out?  Because you guys are going to get your acceptance speech ready now.  I'm looking for the Edward R. Murrow Award, to tell you the truth. 
[03:30:30]  I think this is a broadcast history-making.  Can you make her a chicken for just like a minute?  You know what?  Could you get Marconi to disinvent this?  Can we...  Can we make her a chicken?  I gotta go.  A chicken.  Can we make her...  Can you make me a chicken?  I'm starving.  She's already got the fucking body for it.  Can we just make her a chicken?  Or a fucking...  How about a fucking featherless hen?  Who has a fucking dick in her anything?  Anything where people will go, you know what? 
[03:31:00]  It worked out in the end.  A big German cock in it.  Let's make her...  Let's make believe she's the star of German porn.  Yeah.  Let's make her a chicken.  Let's just do what Joel asked.  Let's make her...  Can we make...  Hold on.  Can we make...  Patty's one cup.  Wait.  Can we make believe that she is the star of shit porn?  It's all about the shit.  Do we have any food?  We can give her like a piece of chocolate or something like that.  Or something that she could eat that's normal.  Yeah.  That we could then tell her...  Can we get that outrageous that she is the number one star of shit porn on the internet? 
[03:31:30]  Her name is Stalker Scatty.  Yes.  Yes.  Stalker Scatty.  Oh, shit.  She's the...  She is it when it comes to shit porn.  And she is pretty proud of that fact.  There's no way this will work.  It's going to be a tough sell.  Of course.  We couldn't get her to admit oral sex.  It's going to bomb just like everything.  Wait.  The set up is wonderful. 
[03:32:00]  Everyone's just taken to watching the television.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Why don't we just make her think that she's a fucking...  People in studio are watching Squawk Box on CNBC.  We are in big trouble.  How about this?  How about we give her some chocolate and she eats a little.  Yeah.  And then you put her under and tell her it's a shit bar.  Oh, she's still chilling it.  And why is she doing that to the shit bar?  Yeah, Doc.  We need some shit humor.  You get what we're getting at?  A little shit.  A little shit humor.  Is there any way she would go with the shit? 
[03:32:30]  Why don't we actually get shit and tell her it's chocolate?  I can't fucking take this show anymore today.  I don't know what is going on here.  Holy fuck.  Can she be a star of a shit video or not?  Nice plus.  Deep sleep.  Deep sleep.  Deep sleep.  In a moment, I'm going to count from one to three. 
[03:33:00]  When I say number three, you'll open your eyes.  You'll realize that you are a German porn star.  No, Doc.  A German.  A German porn star.  Her nickname is the shit queen.  Doc, come on now.  It's German shit porn.  Why hold back now, Doc?  You're a star of German porn.  However, you specialize in shit porn.  We like to call it shit play.  You specialize in shit porn. 
[03:33:30]  You're actually here to accept an award for...  Biggest log ever put on a head.  Poor Joel McHale flew out for this shit.  What about Greg Poobs?  He flew all the way here.  He could be back at his hotel by now.  Yeah, but he came 3,000 fucking miles to sit here and listen to this shit show.  Not sleeping.  Holy shit.  Sitting up on his plane. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  It was just going to be a laugh.  One to three.  When I say number three, you'll open your eyes.  You are a German porn actress here to accept an award for your shit porn scenes on the count  of three.  And she names out for movies, too.  Yeah.  And you're very excited about the movies you did.  You have all the names in your head.  Some of them are pretty outrageous on the count of three.  One, two, and three.  Eyes open.  Hey.  Hey, who are you?  Hey.  My name is Patty. 
[03:34:30]  Hey, Patty.  Hey, is Bob here?  So what are you doing, Patty?  Miss Patty.  I'm here to accept the award for the porn awards.  Patty.  She can't even improv.  Well, what porn award?  Yeah.  What are you accepting for from Germany? 
[03:35:00]  I'm accepting the sheet box award for the best picture of the year that I put on.  We're confused, though.  Do you specialize in a type of porn?  Patty?  It is a specialized type of porn.  Yeah.  What kind?  It is involving, well, around the back, you know. 
[03:35:30]  She's shy to say it, but she's in these movies.  Yeah, we've shot some movies.  Say what that is.  Yeah, what is it?  You can say it.  It's okay.  Schittler's List.  What did you do?  Yeah, what movie?  Well, I am so nervous.  It's okay.  I am so nervous.  It's satellite radio.  So you could say the word.  It's okay.  We all know it anyway.  We all know.  We're very happy you're here.  This is amazing that we got this booking.  The girls and I. 
[03:36:00]  We actually bumped great troops for this.  Let's see.  Girls and I.  Yeah.  We.  What the fuck?  We.  Shit.  Did she say she's accepting the sheet box award?  It's hard to describe.  A pinto?  I can't describe it.  What do you put?  I can't describe it.  It might be too graphic.  It's okay.  You're in the movie.  You eat shit and wipe it on your body in the movies.  Yes, we know that. 
[03:36:30]  We've seen your videos.  We like your movies.  We're just trying to get the audience, you know.  As I snap my finger, you can be as graphic as you want.  Yes.  Well, okay.  The audience is often in shock.  Yeah.  And the girls, they do the lords, and then they like to take a bath together and rub it  all over each other in the bath.  And I am in between the two girls, and they putting it on me. 
[03:37:00]  And we all take in the bath together.  And then.  A shit bath.  A shit bath.  What's the name of the movie?  We've seen the shit bath movie.  I don't know the name of it offhand.  Because people want to, you know, get it out there.  Rub it up some three retards in a tub.  It is entitled.  Soiled.  Soiled.  Soiled.  I like it.  It's pretty good.  Soiled and sexy. 
[03:37:30]  Soiled.  Everyone think there's a gardening how-to?  Soiled.  Soiled.  Soiled.  Soiled.  Soiled and sexy.  Soiled and sexy.  Soiled and sexy.  Yes.  I agree with you on that one.  What's your specialty with this shit?  There's the idea of rubbing it on to see the girl's body.  Yeah.  And, you know, having like a feeling, you know. 
[03:38:00]  Coming soon.  Make you feel, like, free, liberated.  No?  Have you ever worn a shit hat?  No.  No, I never wore that.  That's the...  Somebody told me that's hack in the shit porn world, to actually wear a shit hat.  No.  Nobody does that.  No.  So, tell us about your movie, The Diarrhea of Anne Frank.  No, no. 
[03:38:30]  No such movie.  No?  No.  We don't make it such a wiki as that.  Where do you normally...  Good title, though.  Okay.  Where do you normally...  Where do you normally...  Fucking pal tongue.  Where do you normally drop the duty?  Yeah.  Where does it usually go?  Yeah.  It usually goes down sea drain.  You know.  But I mean, to get it on the girls.  Yeah.  We do it.  It floats on the water.  And the girl takes it and uses it like soap.  Yeah.  Flows on the water to use it like soap.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  Describe the shit.  Yeah.  Describe the shit.  Describe the shit that makes for the best shit porn videos.  Once you do the loose ones.  The loose ones are good.  The loose ones.  Ah, there we go.  Do you have a lot of those?  Is that your specialty?  It's a specialty, yeah.  Yeah.  So you kind of have a lot of loose shit.  Don't ever demonstrate on the Snickers bar, but make believe it's, you know. 
[03:39:30]  Soil.  They're calling her movie brown.  Well, I accept this award.  Right.  Yes, and I'd like to give you this award.  This actually is a piece of shit.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  You're very happy, right?  Open it.  At least just show us.  Yeah, show us the award there.  You can open it.  Oh.  They had to...  The movie's name is Shitty, Shitty Gangbang. 
[03:40:00]  Okay, yeah.  Well, I'm from Joey.  Take it out of the little shit package.  The turd cage.  Hold it in your hand.  Hold it in your hand, regular.  That's it.  Now, smell it.  What does it smell like?  Like, like, yeah, chocolate.  Like, like, sweet.  Do you like that?  I like sweet.  You want to take a bite?  I don't know.  Take a little bite.  I don't know.  Don't ever...  When I snap my fingers, it's actually a chocolate bar. 
[03:40:30]  Don't ever eat this shit bar.  Oh.  Have a bite of the chocolate.  And then when I snap my fingers, it's really shit.  What's wrong, Patty?  What's the matter?  What are you doing?  Patty, what's wrong?  Patty, what's up?  You all right?  I snap my fingers and it goes down really smooth.  Patty, what's up?  Nothing.  What's wrong?  You got a mouthful of what over there? 
[03:41:00]  I think it's chocolate again.  And then take a big bite.  Oh, shoot.  Oh, my God.  It's a chocolate bar, but it tasted different.  What does it taste like?  I can't describe it.  But it tasted different.  I can see it's a chocolate bar, but it tasted different.  Take another bite.  Just give us an opinion.  Why?  Because it really is...  It's a chocolate bar.  It's not my fingers.  It actually is a chocolate bar.  All right.  Take a bite of the chocolate bar, Patty. 
[03:41:30]  Big bite.  There you go.  Good, right?  Oh.  Now give me the old switcheroo.  Now you realize it really is shit.  No.  You look very sad, Patty.  Are you enjoying your food?  She's making a face like every one of our listeners.  Patty, are you enjoying it?  Patty, what's wrong?  Patty.  She's stretching out.  I don't like it. 
[03:42:00]  You don't like what?  I know it's a chocolate bar, but I don't like it.  Why don't you like it?  Why?  Does it taste like something else?  Does it taste good?  Can I throw it away?  No.  No.  What does it taste like?  I don't like it.  Take another bite.  Just give us an opinion.  I don't want to eat it anymore.  Just one more bite.  I don't want to eat it anymore.  Could you at least smell it and see what it smells like?  I'm sure it smells like.  I already smelled it.  Did you tell us or you didn't tell us?  Don, have her rub the shit bar all over her body.  It smells like chocolate, but it doesn't taste right. 
[03:42:30]  Get her to rub the chocolate on her face when she thinks it's chocolate, like by her mouth.  Mm-hmm.  I just don't like how it tastes.  All right.  We get it.  Tell her it's chocolate again.  Delicious chocolate.  Since I snag my finger, this is a wonderful chocolate bar in the world.  No.  Oh, Patty, have it.  I want a bite of that.  Come on.  See if she rub it.  It's good, right?  You can have a bite out of the other end.  I don't really share my food.  Have her rub it on her mouth, like rub it on her face.  When I snag my finger, you want to really just rub it across your lips because it tastes 
[03:43:00]  so good now.  Oh, my God.  That candy bar looks good, Patty.  Put it on like lipstick.  Tell her to put it on like lipstick.  As if you were putting it on like lipstick.  Yeah.  All over her chin in there.  But you're actually not very good at it, and you're kind of getting it on your chin and  your cheeks a little bit.  Yeah.  You're kind of missing it now.  You can tell her to rub it in if it's fun.  Stop your spilling air.  Tell her she's a chicken that's trying to get chocolate bar in it. 
[03:43:30]  You can tell her to rub it under her nose and on her mouth.  Yeah.  Rub it around.  You can tell her it's fine.  We're all playing a game.  Yeah.  Actually, the more you rub it on your face, the better it tastes actually now.  Greg Brose just left.  Then he just left.  Left his coat.  He's been gone for a while.  Yeah.  Now it's chocolate.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's hysterical.  Yeah.  Now.  What?  It doesn't taste bad anymore.  It's chocolate.  Take a big bite.  Let me take a big bite. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  Now it's shit, and she has it on her face and in her mouth.  And now it tastes so good when I snap my fingers, you just can't stop taking bites out of it.  Oh, my God.  That looks good.  I'm starving, Patty.  Give me a piece of that.  Now please tell her it's shit.  She has a big mouthful.  As soon as I snap my fingers, now you realize it is a shit from an elephant.  Oh, my God.  Patty, what are you doing over there?  Why would you eat that?  Patty.  You got it all over your mouth. 
[03:44:30]  It's under your nose.  Oh, my God.  Patty, you're so disgusting.  Oh, she's rubbing her face.  This is wonderful.  Patty, you all right?  What a dope.  What?  What's up?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  You have all over your face.  God, you stink.  What are you doing?  Really?  Why did you take a bite out of that?  Patty.  I don't know.  How's it taste?  Yeah, what does it taste like?  Take another bite.  I don't know.  Yeah, take another bite out of the...  What's wrong, Patty? 
[03:45:00]  Nothing.  You're rubbing your face like crazy.  What's up?  Nothing.  Take another bite.  I wish I had one of those men in black wands.  No one wants to be at the moment and wash my face.  It's so funny.  Because I can forget this.  Wait, you want to wash your face?  Why?  Yes, I think I got some chocolate on it or something.  What's the matter?  It smells weird.  Yeah, who cares about chocolate on the face?  Yeah, eat it.  What's the big deal?  Why would you have to wash your face?  Oof.  Does anybody have a tissue or something?  No.  Tissue.  What is that? 
[03:45:30]  Actually, as I said, my fingers and shit is growing in your hand.  Ew.  Ew, Patty.  What are you doing?  I need a tissue right now.  Why?  Well, it's demanding.  Because I need to wipe my hands and my face.  Yeah, it's weird.  What's going on?  Can I have a tissue?  No.  You wasted the last tissue we gave you.  What are you doing?  What's on your hands?  Patty, keep opening and closing your hand and staring at it.  What's up?  Nothing.  Yeah?  Just tell us. 
[03:46:00]  Are you embarrassed?  Patty.  No.  You should see yourself in a mirror.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  What the hell did you do in the bathroom during the break?  What break?  We had one?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, Patty.  That's when you went in and rubbed shit all over yourself.  For whatever reason.  We don't know.  But what are you doing?  Why are you eating that?  Why are you eating that?  Why would you eat that?  I want to throw this away right now. 
[03:46:30]  No, you can't.  That was an example.  Why did you eat that?  Because the hypnotist told her she was Jimmy Norton.  I want to throw it away.  You can't throw it away.  Jimmy doesn't make many.  Yeah, I made that for you.  You were just supposed to look at it.  Why did you eat it?  She is a dimwit.  She is just a dimwit.  Greg, you haven't missed too much. 
[03:47:00]  I wish I was wherever you were.  I don't care where it was.  It had to have been better.  I got a powerful hunger right now.  I'll tell you that much.  Yeah.  If you were right now having your scrotum checked by Dr. Mangala, you were having more fun than we were.  Better time.  All right, now we make her a chicken and we get the hell out of here.  That's what we do.  Deep sleep.  All the way down deep.  Deep sleep.  That Chinese.  Please make her a racist chicken. 
[03:47:30]  Is there any other thing than that?  All the way down deep sleep.  You guys belong to Angie's List?  Hmm?  You guys know about that Angie's List thing?  What's that?  It's that.  It's a website you go to, you pay some money, and it tells you the best mechanic in town.  It's all voted on by people.  Wow.  I just saw it on TV.  It looks great.  Pretty interesting.  They've run the worst radio show.  What do we do now, Don? 
[03:48:00]  Bring her up.  Racist chicken.  Now, listen.  Can you make her a chicken?  You really want to be a chicken?  As awful as that is, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I do.  Just have her.  Straight around the room.  Yeah.  Yeah, but making chicken noises.  And with, you know, really as loud as she can possibly, make her think there's a good  reason to be a chicken who's loud.  Yeah.  I'm just going to count for one to three.  When I say number three, you'll open your eyes.  You'll realize you're a chicken.  This is going to be great. 
[03:48:30]  You'll be strutting around the room.  Matter of fact, the only thing you can do is make loud chicken noises.  And you'll feel smarter than normal.  Loud chicken noises.  The more loud noises you make.  The more sexy.  The more loud noises you make.  The more good looking a chicken you think you are.  Yeah.  On the count of three.  One, two, and three.  Eyes open.  A non-improving chicken. 
[03:49:00]  What happened to this portrait?  Cock-a-doodle-dope.  Just flap your arms quietly.  She's starting to try to do something.  She's a fucking, it's Blair's cousin chicken.  It's a chicken with muscular dystrophy.  Jerry's chickens.  Michael J. Chicken. 
[03:49:30]  It's a chicken with Lou Gehrig's disease.  The luckiest chicken on the face of the earth.  Hey, chicken, hey, chicken Shilo.  Did you make her a paralyzed chicken?  She has to walk around.  Tell her to walk around the room.  She can't walk around.  That awful chicken body of her.  Chicken Reeve.  Make her a racist chicken.  Can we make...  Is she saying cluck, cluck? 
[03:50:00]  Can we make a racist?  Let's make her a racist.  She's in trouble.  Yeah, but it's a weird racism.  Yeah.  She hates white people.  Yeah, that's good.  She hates white people.  When I say on my fingers, you're a chicken that just hates white people.  That's pretty offensive. 
[03:50:30]  Have her say some awful things about white people.  If you understood chicken, this is awful stuff she's saying.  She even babbles in chicken.  Yeah.  Have her say something awful about white people.  Can you have her...  Yeah.  Apparently, the chicken's not the closer.  Go ahead, Don.  When I snap my finger, you're just going to say the worst thing about white people is your best chicken voice.  Probably the biggest racist of any race. 
[03:51:00]  What, white people?  Yeah.  Wow, that's like a paradox.  Boy.  Really?  Grew up with that.  Grew up with what, white people?  Are you still a chicken?  Yeah.  But you can only talk like a chicken now.  So, Patty, what do you mean by that?  Oh, I don't know.  All the lynchings were done by white people in the 20s.  All right, way to keep this fun.  Hey, can we have... 
[03:51:30]  Maybe the chicken knows a little more truth than you guys are ready for.  Strange drumsticks.  Can we have her up?  Can we have her somehow be very, very alarmed by the audience staring at her from out there?  Yeah.  And they're here for her execution or something.  Yeah, or she's...  Yeah.  All right, Greg Proops.  I'm leaving.  Thank you.  Greg, nice to meet you.  I'm sorry to leave on the low note.  That's all right. 
[03:52:00]  You're going to have a high note at comics.  Nice.  Thank you.  14th and 9th Avenue.  Greg Proops is at four shows.  I'll be channeling a racist chicken tonight in the second show if you want to come by.  He's a great comic.  Go to comics.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com to see Greg Proops.  Nice to meet you, Greg.  There goes Greg Proops.  All right.  All right.  I wish we could follow him.  How about this?  She should be somehow alarmed at all the people out there because we...  Wait, wait, Jimmy.  How about this?  She's alarmed.  She knows they're here for her, but they don't know why. 
[03:52:30]  And it's really freaking her out.  Yeah, she doesn't know why, but she knows she's in some kind of trouble, and they're all  here to address her about it.  Right.  What if they're all people from her family?  Yeah.  Yes.  She can't see their face.  They're all her family, and they're here to yell at her and talk to her.  Mm-hmm.  Excellent.  Let's try to end this without jumping through the window.  All right.  I'm going to count from one to three.  When I say number three, you'll open your eyes.  You'll realize that sitting outside the window are all the members of your family. 
[03:53:00]  They're here to see you on the radio.  And you have a lot of things to say to them on the count of three.  One, two, and three eyes open.  Hey, Patty.  Yeah.  Feel better?  What's wrong?  Why are you looking at the crowd, Patty?  You all right?  It looks funny.  Huh?  My foster parents came back. 
[03:53:30]  They're over there?  Bill?  They're somewhere in there, yeah.  Oh, Bill.  There's a lot of people out there, Patty, who are...  Do you want to at least turn and look a little bit?  Yeah.  Turn and share a look at the...  That is one ugly family.  Is there anything you want to say to them?  Well, my foster parents, well, I'm glad I brought you back today because you ruined me.  You ruined my life. 
[03:54:00]  Told me I was going to end up in a mental institution, and I didn't.  So there.  I was going to end up like my mother.  I didn't, so there.  But it kept me from doing a lot of things I wanted to do.  As soon as I set my finger, just get that all out, but you can only speak Chinese.  Yes.  Donna, so every time she hears the name open...  I didn't like it.  Jesus. 
[03:54:30]  All right, how about this, Doc?  Perfect.  How do you wreck it?  A hypnotist.  Do we understand Chinese?  All right, Doc.  Every time she hears the name Opie, she yells out, the Jews run the world.  I'm about to say dope.  As soon as I snap my fingers, any time you hear the name Opie, you're going to just yell  out, the Jews run the world now.  So at least, we're not sure if you went under or not. 
[03:55:00]  Are you all right?  Yeah.  I mean, Anthony didn't know what happened.  I certainly don't.  I mean, Opie isn't too sure what happened, you know?  The...  I can't hear anybody.  Line?  Do you think that...  Do you think it was happened by Opie?  On the line.  Patty, it's Opie. 
[03:55:30]  Patty, it's Opie.  Do you know Opie?  Yeah, on the line.  Opie.  Yeah.  Yeah, Opie.  On the line.  Opie.  On the...  I just can't understand.  Yeah, Opie.  What do you mean you can't understand?  Maybe you should say it again.  Maybe she doesn't understand.  I'm hearing, but not hearing right.  I don't hear words.  All right, hold on a second.  I snap my fingers every time you hear the word Opie.  When you hear anybody say Opie, you say the Jews run the world now. 
[03:56:00]  We're not too sure if you went under or not.  Anthony doesn't think so.  How do you feel, Opie?  The Jews run the world.  Well, I think, I don't really think the whole hypnotist thing, you know, worked with Patty  whatsoever.  Why not, Opie?  The Jews run the world.  Every time she hears your name, she thinks she's Steve from Payser.  You mean like, I don't think she was relaxed enough to go under.  Nothing against Dom, but I just don't think she was relaxed enough to be hypnotized.  Because we, Patty, we were trying to get you to talk about your foster parents and we 
[03:56:30]  didn't really get...  I know what you're saying, Opie.  The Jews run the world.  I know what you're saying, Opie, because when we asked her to speak Chinese, Opie, as  I'm talking to you...  The Jews run the world.  She just spoke English.  Well, Joel, this is Opie, and I'm addressing what you just said.  The Jews run the world.  Yes, when...  You're not, Anthony.  You're Opie.  That's right.  The Jews run the world.  But Opie wasn't my given name.  Amen.  Amen.  I was born Greg, but yeah, I got the nickname when, you know, the nickname Opie when I  was 12 years old. 
[03:57:00]  Why when you were 12, Opie?  Because I kind of looked like Opie.  The Jews run the world.  We can have fun with this one.  Okay, let's switch it to who commits crimes.  Teasing, of course.  Make her quiet for a second.  We got to do something.  Can we do one thing with Roland?  Oh, we do a deep sleep.  Okay, how about this?  Deep sleep.  Every time she hears the name Roland, please just do this once, she screams, give me black 
[03:57:30]  dick or give me death.  Please.  Please, Don.  We need a big ending.  She has to yell it.  Yes.  And she has to yell it.  Don, just let you know that this is the end of your career.  Thank you.  Well, did you hear his plug earlier?  This is not much of a...  Every time she hears the name Roland, she has to shout that.  It's not watching me.  Give me black dick or give me death.  All right. 
[03:58:00]  All right, I'm just going to count from one to three.  When I say the number three, every time and any time you hear anyone say the name Roland,  you're going to stand up.  You're going to shout out, give me black dick or give me death.  Each and every time, you won't be able to resist.  On the count of three, one, two, and three.  I just don't know if it works.  I mean, you ate a little bit of chocolate.  Yeah.  You dozed off for a little while.  Do you feel relaxed, Patty?  Yeah.  I don't know if Roland felt that way. 
[03:58:30]  Roland, what do you think?  I think it's...  She...  I like black dick.  Roland, uh...  I like black dick.  Now, Roland.  I like black dick.  Now, Roland, uh...  I like black dick.  You were here.  I'm at Caroline's tonight.  Roland.  I like black dick.  Roland, now listen.  I like black dick.  Roland, um...  I like black dick. 
[03:59:00]  So, Dom the hypnotist, you think, Roland, that Patty...  I like black dick.  Is this Opie talking right now?  Wow.  This is Roland.  I like black dick.  Roland, what do you think about this whole thing?  I like black dick.  I think she probably went under.  Do you think so, Roland?  I think so.  I like black dick.  Roland, you're crazy if you think she went under.  You're nuts.  That's right, Roland.  I like black dick.  Patty.  Patty.  She's a fan of Dick Gregory.  That's what it is.  Kitty hypnotized her and she's saying,  good timing with the mic. 
[03:59:30]  Good timing with the mic.  Not really.  I like black dick.  All right.  We get it.  We get it.  You're a fat white girl.  Hey, Patty.  Patty.  Patty, do you like Roland or...  I like black dick.  What?  But that's not what I'm asking.  Do you like Roland?  I like black dick. 
[04:00:00]  I can't stop saying that.  Why?  I didn't hear you saying that.  Yeah.  What did you say?  Did Roland hear it?  I like black dick.  Roland.  Now listen.  I like black dick.  Roland.  What do we got booked on the show next week?  Roland.  Joel McHale's coming on Monday.  Who's Joel McHale?  I'm right here.  Oh, hi, Joel.  I'm over here.  Roland.  Yes, please. 
[04:00:30]  Seth Green.  Roland, speak up.  Wait, I have an idea.  Can we sit there back for a second?  That's going to be Tuesday.  Let's have a seat.  Let's have a seat.  Can you put it back on there for a second?  Can you make...  Can you do something with, um...  I have to fart.  Is there any way we can convince her that it smells like some sort of flowers?  Oh, yeah.  Easy.  And that she wants...  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And she wants to sniff your asshole?  No, no, no.  I'm going to stand there and just fart.  And can you have her convince that the sweetest thing she's ever smelled?  You can? 
[04:01:00]  That's easy.  Okay.  And then she'll want to just wave it at herself.  Oh, good.  I'm just going to count for one to three.  When I say the number three, anytime you smell anybody near you farting, it is going  to smell like a fresh bouquet of flowers.  It's going to smell so good that you just keep kind of waving your hands to it.  You can't get enough of that smell on the count of three.  If you understand what I've just said, just nod your head.  Great. 
[04:01:30]  One, two, and three.  Eyes opening.  How are you feeling?  Pretty good?  Feeling good?  Okay.  Pretty relaxed?  Getting cold this year.  Getting a little bit cold.  Let's hope this doesn't fail.  It's not like firecrackers. 
[04:02:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I guess she's not getting it.  Everything smelled all right?  I guess she's not getting it.  Everything good?  Yeah.  What does it smell like?  I can't think.  Like chrysanthemums.  I smell chrysanthemums.  I like them because they come in nice colors.  I'll be doing brown and browner.  I like chrysanthemums. 
[04:02:30]  I'm reminded of mums.  They can be pink or yellow.  Didn't that really sound like a pack of black jackets going off?  That was a perfect impression.  Your asshole did a perfect impression of 4th of July.  It's just these impressions.  You think of it as the real people with bad breath.  Got another one? 
[04:03:00]  Cooking up?  Maybe a Roman candle?  Wow.  Wow.  Why?  Why are we still here?  I don't know.  I said it at 940.  Oh, my God.  Why don't we...  I believe we should do line of the day.  Yeah.  Cut our losses.  We have a meeting.  We can do this again, though.  We can do this again on another day.  We can definitely do something with us.  On the day we want to lose our jobs. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah.  For lack of production.  Lack of producing an entertaining program.  Can she, like, I don't know.  Leave?  Well, just with the line of the day, I'm thinking every time we say something during that, just...  Something happens.  Oh, my God.  Or not.  Line of the day is...  Carbonite.com. 
[04:04:00]  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any of your files.  Check it out at Carbonite.com.  Promo code XM.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  A man accused of groping boy in a grocery store.  I get that.  You do?  Jesus.  Right to the next runner-up line of the day.  iTunes Apple Store offers slew of programs and games. 
[04:04:30]  How about the game Take Picture of Genitals, Send to Friends?  Is she sleeping over there, Don?  Yeah, she's up.  Another runner-up line of the day.  A good founding editor of Atlanta-based Pink Magazine, a publication that focuses on professional women...  On socks.  ...said she's not stopping with Atlantis.  Sorry, Jim.  And I just fucking kept going there.  One more?  Can she do the flower thing again soon? 
[04:05:00]  What was the flower thing?  You know.  She smells something.  Oh, you got another one?  I might.  I missed the first one.  I had to go take a leak.  It was a gem.  Did it work?  Yeah.  She smelled Kirsten.  Kirsten.  Kirsten, why don't you sit over here so you can...  Smell the flowers.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Don.  I'm just going to count from one to three.  I'm going to say number three.  You'll open your eyes.  You'll realize if anyone farts near you, it'll smell just like a fresh bouquet of flowers. 
[04:05:30]  You cannot get enough of that smell.  It is fantastic.  On the count of three.  Hey, can you get her to ask people out there after if they'll fart because she likes the smell?  And as you walk outside, you'll be asking people to fart in front of you because you just love the smell of farts.  It smells unbelievable like a fresh bouquet of flowers.  You won't be able to stop asking each and every person you go up to on the count of three. 
[04:06:00]  Eyes open.  One, two, and three.  Okay, do we have any more lines?  Yeah, we have another runner-up line of the day.  Let's see.  Roland laughing.  I can't get over it.  What's up, Patty?  I don't know.  Smells pretty good?  Yes, I smell, uh, azaleas. 
[04:06:30]  Azaleas.  Azaleas?  I don't know if we call it, too.  What are those?  What's an azalea?  An azalea is a type of a flower.  Or an azalea.  Of course.  Whatever.  Purple and violets.  An azalea.  Oh, my God.  Purple and violets.  Oh, my God.  Sometimes you've got to stop and smell the Rosses.  Idiot.  Oh, my God.  I got...  Hold on.  Before we do another, uh, runner-up line of the day, I got to... 
[04:07:00]  I got to...  Oh, my God.  Sorry about that, guys.  Oof.  Oh, shit.  Oh.  Wow.  I feel like I'm in a whole flower bed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're fertilizing.  And there's a lot of snow flowers.  We said it was a tombstone near him, too.  You smell flowers, Patty?  I'll take care of that.  No.  Oh, God.  I smell a lot of flowers.  Like roses and azaleas. 
[04:07:30]  I like roses, too.  I love roses.  Roses are great.  All right.  I have to word them.  All right.  I don't like the thorns, but I like the roses.  All right.  We get it.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Let's see your shirt.  What is that shirt?  Oh, my God.  I've never seen a fat skeleton before.  Oh, God.  He's a skeleton.  That one got me.  What, Patty? 
[04:08:00]  He's a skeleton.  He smells like violets.  What does?  I like violets.  Good for you.  All right.  Very good.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Is that the worst cause ever there, Jimmy?  Yeah.  A farm on the White House lawn?  I, I, I, I, that and Nambla, you'd have to go to a photo finish.  And finally, thanks to Carbonite.com, here is your line of the day. 
[04:08:30]  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I know tomorrow I can tame her, if I only believe, wish me luck diary, Christopher Reeve.  I'm kidding, eh-oh.  Stupid Roland. 
[04:09:00]  And that's endearing.  They're Roland.  Joel, are you at Carolyn's tonight?  Yes, I am.  We sold out tonight, tomorrow, and first show Sunday.  There's a late show Sunday that's been added.  That's insane, Joel.  For Joel McHale.  It's 212-757-4100.  If all the shows are pre-sold, this one will sell out.  So don't be an asshole.  Just call up and get your tickets.  That sounds like a great...  That's great to be pre-sold to Carolyn.  It's not an easy one to pre-sold.  That sounds like a great endorsement.  Well, I mean, it's the truth, though.  I mean, it's not an easy room to sell in advance. 
[04:09:30]  I know you're exhausted from, you know, Patty, but...  Yeah.  212-757-4100.  And, Joel, you're going to come back Monday to do real radio.  To do some real...  Yeah, yeah.  We didn't even expect it to.  As long as Patty and John will come.  Yeah, well, this is what I figured I wouldn't be able to go to bed.  And they realize I see Jim fart into a microphone, so...  Yeah, it's my specialty.  Hey, can we follow Patty out of the studio?  Because remember what you...  Remember, Don, that thing?  Do you want to reset that thing to? 
[04:10:00]  Can I throw this out?  Why?  Why?  I don't really eat chocolate like this.  I don't like to use the bars.  See if Owen wants it.  We heard you.  We heard you.  I don't know why I'm holding it.  All right, Patty, thanks for coming by.  Why did you think you were a shit queen?  I smell Azela's and tulips.  Azela's still.  Azela's.  Tulips.  I smell tulips too.  Tulips?  I like the smell of tulips. 
[04:10:30]  Yeah, of course.  Flowers for Algernon, you fucking retard.  She's out.  I like honeysuckles and Azela's and stuff like that.  Enough about the Azela's.  Sounds like a bed of roses.  I love it.  Really nice.  Nice, pleasant aroma.  Somebody must have sprayed something.  I wish it was Zycline B in front of you.  I wish they would have sprayed diarrhea all over you.  This smells pleasant. 
[04:11:00]  Pleasant.  Oh, my God.  It's amazing.  Let's just acknowledge.  I like how it smells.  We get it.  It smells good.  You fucking know.  Flowers.  Let's take an assessment.  Yeah, I don't know.  Let it keep going in the background.  It'll be funny.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm getting enough of it.  I like it.  Let me try to do something.  Oh, Jesus.  I hope it's a good Jimmy one.  How are you feeling, Patty?  Good. 
[04:11:30]  Holy shit.  He did something very silly, but I don't know.  Well, for some reason, I smell lilies or something.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's a coincidence.  So, was this a thumbs up or a thumbs down?  This show.  It smells like lilies.  This is a two thumbs on the side of a wheelchair. 
[04:12:00]  It is like the smell of flowers.  I like jasmine.  Those are pretty, too.  Enough about the fuck.  I know we get it.  Really?  Jasmine's nice.  Well, Don, the hypnotist.  He did his job.  You definitely did your job, sir.  We'll have you come back.  We do not fault you.  That's for sure.  We fault ourselves.  This show, though, is a collector's item.  Why?  Because you will never hear it on a worse note.  I don't know.  There was some.  I don't know what else to say.  All I know is I like that.  Oh, wow.  Jimmy, you brought some of that in with you.  I want my flowers. 
[04:12:30]  The azela's.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm smelling azela's.  I want to puke.  It didn't turn out how we wanted it to.  No, I understand.  I had a lot of fun.  It still was something.  Yes.  Garbage.  Don, the hypnotist, you visit hypnotictouch.com?  Yes, or donthehypnotist.com.  Or donthehypnotist.com.  Very good.  And you got that gig two months from now where?  July 26th.  July 26th.  I'm a couple weeks away, right?  July 26th in Arlington? 
[04:13:00]  In Arlington at the sports pub in Arlington.  How are you going to have hypnotist people at a sports pub?  It's going to be tough.  Yeah.  Yeah, after this show, you should do it at the cemetery they have over there.  I smell azela's.  Azela's of the Ross's.  She's dumb as a bag of rocks.  Stupid.  But she was the shit boy star.  That was actually good.  She spoke German, and then she was chewing shit.  She was a shit box queen.  And then she started speaking French.  Is it okay that she's still under hypnosis, just wandering around out there? 
[04:13:30]  Yeah.  Done.  Can you have her think that...  Amos just wandering around aimlessly smelling far.  Can you have her think that fucking cabs hurling towards her are little puppies who need a kiss?  Fucking rolling in his lap.  Look at rolling.  Rolling, that's funny.  Yeah, enjoy the scene.  What do you think of Patty?  Be honest.  Interesting.  No, be honest.  It's okay.  I don't know, like part whack job, I guess.  Does she bother you?  No, no, doesn't bother me.  The fact that you can't improv? 
[04:14:00]  It doesn't bother me.  It just...  Yeah.  Issues.  Sorry.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  Doing a pee, actually.  Oh, all right.  We're going to end the show, then.  Yeah, we'll just...  You might want to go get Patty there, Don.  Yeah.  All right, donthehypnotist.com or hypnotictouch.com.  I want to thank the studio audience for sitting through that.  Woo!  Woo!  They were very, very quiet for the last hour or so.  We appreciate that. 
[04:14:30]  Patty, thank you.  You're welcome.  Do you know why you were here?  To be hypnotized.  Did it work, you think?  I don't...  I guess so.  I don't remember a few things.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  Some things are just a little blurry.  What do you remember?  I just remember talking about flowers.  Right.  And then I remember putting my hand out like this, and he told me I wouldn't be able to  get them apart, and I couldn't.  Right.  You know, until he said drop them, and I did.  Right. 
[04:15:00]  Why do you remember the smell of flowers?  That's weird.  I don't know.  Yeah.  No idea why.  And why didn't you like that candy bar?  What candy bar?  Yeah, exactly.  And why did you admit to your dad touching you?  That was a little outrageous.  Uncomfortable.  That was uncomfortable for everybody.  Did I?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I just have a memory of laying next to them on the couch. 
[04:15:30]  Yeah.  Well, some things came out today.  Like what?  You might want to listen to the replay, my friend.  I guess I better.  Yeah.  But you like Black Cock, too, which was.  What?  Yeah, you couldn't stop saying that one.  That was really, really strange, Patty, but out of nowhere, you were basically saying  how much you like Black Cock.  I don't remember saying that.  Why would you just say it?  I don't remember it.  Well, trust me.  Listen to the replay, and then call us Monday, because you love Black Cock. 
[04:16:00]  We're going to get some of that action over the weekend there, Patty.  Yeah.  What?  Nice.  Whatever.  Shut up.  All right.  I can just hate you.  Joel, we're going to do something with you on Monday.  Joel, Monday.  Right on.  I think we saved you today.  You're on the red eye, very tired.  You might not have been up to par today.  People would have been like, ah, Joel is all right.  I think us completely ignoring you, letting you sit there, putting on a horrible show,  helped you. 
[04:16:30]  It broke me in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On Monday, you'll be well-rested, come in full of piss and vinegar, like they say.  It's going to be great.  We're huge fans of his, too.  I know.  We're going to get all that gossip stuff and talk about Tyra and everybody else.  By the way, while I was talking, Danny ran over and just farted right in Patty's face.  But Patty's sleeping right now.  What happened?  I was hoping it was going to get picked up by the mic.  I don't know if it did or not.  Yeah, I heard a little pop.  What happens now there, Don?  Oh, I'll bring her up out of this. 
[04:17:00]  How long?  A couple seconds.  Yeah, let's just leave her there.  Yeah.  Sure.  That's fine.  Let her...  Can you get us to sleep like that?  I don't need any of that...  I just want to sleep like that.  Yeah.  That's a deep sleep going on right now.  Just go to sleep that quick.  Like our listeners.  I have actually brought with me a relaxation disc.  I'll be happy to give it to you.  Oh, cool.  I'll be right out.  Cool.  Really?  Yep.  Well, will it fuck me up, though?  No.  All right. 
[04:17:30]  Let's play that when I'm back on Monday.  Let's see what happens.  Joel's doing...  All his shows are sold out at Caroline's, but we got one still left.  Sunday night, 1030.  They added a show.  Yeah, they added that show because the demand is ridiculous.  Well, I need the money.  Caroline's, 212-757-4100.  We're out of here.  And he's doing Conan, too.  What?  He's doing Conan.  On Tuesday.  You're doing Conan?  Yes.  Nice.  Very, very nice.  Yeah, I'm very excited.  That's dream come true. 
[04:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's very...  No, I really am.  I just haven't slept.  Two days.  Other than that.  No, staying up for this.  No, I can't wait.  So...  I really can't.  I can't describe.  From L.A. to New York.  For this!  For this!  We have our meeting.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's do our meeting.  We got a meeting.  So we'll see you guys Monday.  Yeah.  Roland, it's to you.  All right. 
[04:18:30]  That's it?  Say something.  Oh, I thought that was over.  I thought life's going on like the movie.  No, say something.  Oh, um...  That's all, folks?  I don't know.  No, this is the big...  That's all, folks?  This is the big out.  Oh, um...  Have a good weekend  and go see Joel at Caroline's.  Oh, thanks, Bryce.  You're welcome.  And, um...  Who do you hate?  Who do you hate right now?  Um... 
[04:19:00]  No.  Who do you hate?  Who do I hate?  Um...  I don't know.  Poe?  No, I don't hate Poe.  Steve?  No.  Danny?  No.  Are you suggesting you get hypnotized?  Mm-mm.  I don't hate anybody, really.  Just my bodega guy,  but that's about it.  He did.  He, like, poisoned my coffee.  I drank coffee and had a shit for two days.  So you're going to kill him now?  No, just taunt him. 
[04:19:30]  That's about it.  He's going to do that, too.  Yeah.  Just get it on film, all right, Roland?  I will.  All right, why are we still trying?  This is obvious what happened today.  We'll see you Monday.  Daddy, daddy, daddy.  Please, please, please don't kill me, daddy.  I want, I want, I want to live.  Why are you killing us?  Wow!  Fat belly achers, shut up.  You deserve to burn in hell.  Be an Anthony. </pre>
