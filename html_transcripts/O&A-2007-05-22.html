<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with suggestive banter before pivoting to a discussion of a tanker truck crash shown on the morning news.  The hosts then dissected local news coverage, particularly focusing on Channel 11 traffic reporter Jill Nicolini, speculating about her on-air persona and wardrobe choices.  They next covered "Subway Superman," who famously saved a person having a seizure on subway tracks, highlighting his subsequent fame, including an appearance on *Deal or No Deal* where he infamously chose the $25 briefcase.  Audio of this moment was played.  The hosts contrasted public concern over whales lost in a Sacramento canal with the lack of similar attention given to impoverished families.  A listener called in relating this to the A&E documentary "Lotto Curse." Further listener calls and discussions followed, revolving around Subway Superman, a purported (and fake) video of a man letting a train run over him, and a suspected hoax hot tub video. The segment concluded with "Rock Scream Tuesday," featuring 80s-style rock screams from the hosts, staff (including Danny, Travis, Joe from Jersey, E-Rock, and intern Jared), and callers, with humorous commentary on their varying levels of success. Jim Norton was mentioned but wasn't a guest.

Following "Rock Scream Tuesday," Anthony shared a news story about Viagra potentially alleviating jet lag. This transitioned into a bizarre true crime story about a man who tried to kill his girlfriend by placing her car on train tracks, only to be killed himself when the car was hit and propelled onto him.  Further news items included a police investigation into nude photos of nursing home residents and the release of Ronald Reagan's diaries.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a lengthy interview with recurring guest Pat from Minaki. The discussion centered on Pat's recent breakup, his weight issues, his impounded delivery van, and his upcoming participation in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.  Pat detailed his heartbreak and unrequited feelings for his ex-girlfriend.  Humorous anecdotes about his personal life and appearance were shared throughout.  Jimmy, a recurring guest, plugged his upcoming stand-up shows during this segment.

The Pat from Minaki segment, which also touched on his dating life, heavily featured discussions about his weight and lack of recent sexual activity.  Several female callers offered advice, some bluntly, with one caller hanging up after learning Pat's age.  Pat revealed he was widowed, discussed his dating difficulties, excessive eating habits (including consuming a five-pound bag of pistachios in a short time), and his estranged relationship with his father. The hosts joked about his situation, suggesting therapy, a weight-loss show, and even a setup with a 50-year-old virgin.  Pat recounted details of his last sexual encounter in the early 1990s and a paid encounter with a sex worker in the 80s.  The segment concluded with a "line of the day" contest and a comedy show ticket giveaway, along with a humorous recounting of the timeline since Patâ€™s last sexual experience.

[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police.  I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  It's too bad you got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school. 
[00:04:00]  You probably have three or four kids and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tony, I'd like to apologize.  I would apologize.  Go away.  Go away.  Opie.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in.  Anthony.  I just think Nazi and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious.  Hilarious people.  You guys ready to laugh? 
[00:04:30]  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get on the road. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, good morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello.  Time to wake up.  And there's this morning's truck crash. 
[00:05:30]  My God.  Nice.  What happens overnight?  People get sleepy.  Oh, that guy is an investigation even necessary.  It's a big tanker truck on a turn.  On its side.  On its off ramp.  Oh, look at that turn.  Oh, my God.  Apparently, he was going a bit too fast.  It's a horseshoe turn, man.  That's a tight turn.  We've talked about this in the past. 
[00:06:00]  We're privy to some very interesting video at this hour of the day.  Yep.  A lot of people, they don't start watching the news until maybe a little later in the morning.  By then, all these horrific car accidents overnight are cleared up.  They hose it down and people are driving over it.  Don't even know what happened.  And they move on to other stories.  But if you want to see some cool stuff, you've got to get up a little earlier and turn on your local news  and you'll see all the horrific crashes from the night before.  Drunk driving, truck drivers on crystal meth just trying to get that run in. 
[00:06:30]  Get a few more miles.  Just trying to get a few more miles.  A few more miles behind them.  And all of a sudden, they're on their side.  Not enough crank.  And then around 7, 8 o'clock, you wake up, the normal people out there,  and they turn on their news with their coffee.  And all that stuff is well gone.  And they're doing dog without leg stories.  Yeah, some dumb thing.  But every morning, we see the car crash of the morning or the truck crash of the morning.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  A tanker on its side, and it looks like it has some fuel.  Yeah, something might be going on there.  They definitely were going a little too fast.  Doesn't look good.  And I want to thank Channel 11 here in New York City.  I know there's a radio company that we work for that gets really mad when we go local.  Oh, they're too local!  When they say Channel 11, our radio station in Detroit doesn't understand!  I think they get it.  Actually, it was in Detroit, because they understand.  Craig Schwab understands in Detroit. 
[00:07:30]  Our old pal who runs the station we're on in Detroit.  It's another medium-sized city.  They go local, and they talk about local stuff, and our people are left in the dark.  Just change the number we're talking about on the news, because it happens all over the country.  That's what I was trying to tell this person.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  We explain it to the point where we bring everybody in.  Yeah.  For example, Channel 11 here in New York City, they got this Jill Nicolini. 
[00:08:00]  Jill Nicolini.  She used to do the in-house announcements at the Islander Games.  She used to be naked.  And she used to be naked in Playboy, yes.  And you could find her online.  See, that's how we localized it.  Jill Nicolini, you can find her naked online.  Yeah, go ahead.  All right, do we have your attention?  And she's now, she's the traffic girl on Channel 11.  And in all honesty, she has some chops.  When she was doing the in-house announcements at the Islander Games, there was something about her. 
[00:08:30]  Everyone knew that this girl had something besides being a hot piece of ass.  Yeah.  So Channel 11 scooped her up, and they gave her the very easy task of flying around in a helicopter doing traffic reports.  And then somebody who's very smart at Channel 11 here in New York said, you know what, we're not getting all the hotness we can out of this situation.  Not with her in a helicopter.  Helicopter where it's almost like a webcam in her face.  Yeah, it's right in her face.  She can't really see how hot she is, and it's a confined area, so she can't really show off her body. 
[00:09:00]  She likes to dance around a little bit, and she couldn't do that strapped into a helicopter.  So the powers that be that are just brilliant at Channel 11 said, you know what?  If we take her out of the helicopter and get her in a studio with fine lighting and makeup where she could stand up straight, I think we're going to get a few more viewers because people are going to be checking out her hotness.  Yep.  So then they got her out of the helicopter.  Then they got her in the studio, and she's doing the traffic reports.  But Anthony and I noticed that they showed Jill Nicolini for like two seconds, and she's got some hot outfits. 
[00:09:30]  She's never worn the same outfit twice, by the way.  Now, always something low cut, though.  It's always a brand new sexy outfit waiting for us every morning.  Sexy.  So, but the problem is they show for two seconds, and then they go to the traffic map, which is just primitive like video game technology from 1985.  Like Atari.  Like Atari.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Like square green cars and stuff. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Just awful.  And they show them, and if there's a traffic jam, the cars turn red in that area.  Yeah.  They're just slowing down a little bit.  Yeah.  And sometimes they have video.  Just video of nothing, by the way.  It's just like the B-roll.  It's just stock footage of cars just in trouble and just in traffic.  So, so they show her for two seconds, and they show all this stuff for about two minutes, and then they go back to her for two seconds to wrap it up.  To say, yeah, take it easy.  And I'm sitting there yelling at the TV every morning going, will you just throw her on a green screen in front of all these cars so everyone could see her hotness? 
[00:10:30]  And let her point out, you know, hey, look, traffic here.  It's red.  Hey, see these square green cars?  This is not a problem.  Ooh, these red square cars over here.  Oh, problem.  Problem.  So this morning I noticed that they, I think they listened to our radio show.  Mm-hmm.  Because now Jill Nicolini is in front of a green screen with all this car crap behind her. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Looking hot for the entire segment, instead of the first two seconds and the last two seconds.  And then I noticed that all these, these little square green cars are kind of just bumping into her body.  And I, I may have had a comment about that, that she's so hot the cars can't even help themselves.  They can't help themselves.  They're doing what nature told them to do.  There was, there was, in the Holland, out the Lincoln.  Right. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, there was a good scene this morning where some of the cars were bumping right into her breasts.  Right.  And other parts of her body.  Other parts of her body.  And we may have had a comment or two.  Yeah, perhaps if they keep listening to the show, maybe they'll take our advice that we were giving in the office this morning and put some squiggly tails on the cars.  But that's what guys do.  I mean, we're up this early.  You really think we're paying close attention to the traffic or the news in general?  Don't care.  I'm in. 
[00:12:00]  We're trying to get the sleepies out of our eyes.  We actually turned off one local channel here in New York because they got rid of the hot broad.  Yep.  We're like, no hot broad?  I don't, I don't, I don't want to listen to your news.  Simple as that.  Don't watch it anymore.  No, they got, ah, whatever.  She's a nice person, so I should leave her alone.  But she's a little long in the tooth.  She ain't the hot girl.  She's a little long in the tooth and she doesn't like showing off the cleavage like the old broad did.  Long in the tooth.  Do you know that's a horse term?  She's a little long in the tooth, if you know what I mean.  It's a goddamn horse term. 
[00:12:30]  You check their teeth to see how long they are to see how old they are.  And more importantly, she just, she covers up.  She doesn't allow us a look at the cleavage.  That's what we're looking for on TV.  There she is.  See, as we talk about her, there she is.  There she is in front of the screen with all these little square green cars trying to bump into her again.  So there you go.  God bless.  Good morning.  This is the O&A virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  We got a little Jimmy Norton and Anthony and you guys already ringing the phones off the hook here. 
[00:13:00]  The whole crew.  God, our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  So.  People love chatting.  Ah.  I don't know why they put all my stuff way far away where I can't reach it.  Hey, by the way, can we get the audio of Subway Superman today?  That.  We have to see.  Look, man.  We all love on this show dark humor, black comedy.  Mm-hmm.  Subway Superman.  You want to explain for America, Anthony? 
[00:13:30]  For America.  America.  Because maybe one of the cities we broadcast who don't, they don't understand what a subway  is, I guess.  This was a national story, so go screw.  Just go see Spider-Man 3 and then you understand everything we're talking about because we're  in the city that Spider-Man 3 was filming.  Right.  There you go.  Every Spider-Man's you should know this city like the back of your hand.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Subway Superman, you might remember a few months back, he was the guy that was standing  on a subway platform, saw some young man have some type of seizure, and then he fell, 
[00:14:00]  fell, the young man fell onto the train tracks and lo and behold, here comes a train.  Oh, no.  What to do?  What to do?  Well, Subway Superman decided to jump onto the tracks and put his body over this guy  and let the subway actually run over both of them.  He was in between the rails, kind of in a, or he was actually outside the rail, from  what I understand, in one of those little ditches that are on the side of the rails,  and the train went right over both of them. 
[00:14:30]  And the reason, by the way, I gotta jump in, the reason is because he's crazy, not because  he's a hero.  Yeah, that's kind of...  But the whole world is looking at this guy, including the President of the United States,  like he's a hero.  No, he's nuts!  He's kind of crazy.  No one in their right mind would do that, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  If you've seen interviews with him and stuff, he's a little eccentric, to say the least.  And he's been given a lot of stuff.  Donald Trump gave him $10,000.  He's talked about how he just opens up his mail and has money in there. 
[00:15:00]  Like people are sending him everything from $5,000 to just a dollar.  People feel compelled to send him money for doing this.  And they've given him cars and vacations to Disney for him and his kids.  And then he was invited on deal or no deal.  He was at the dinner of the...  What was the big Bush, the State of the Union?  Yeah.  Down there.  They acknowledged him at the State of the Union, the President.  Then he got up and waved. 
[00:15:30]  He wouldn't sit back down.  He's waving and waving.  High-fiving Congress.  We get it.  Exactly.  So he was on deal or no deal last night.  Decided to throw him a bone.  Because he's a celebrity now.  He's our hero.  He's also in a bit of a jam up with his agent.  I guess he figured because so much was going on, he picked up an agent.  He signed a contract, apparently, that says that he owes his agent 50% of everything he makes. 
[00:16:00]  What did he get?  Steve Russo?  Yeah.  Sorry.  We had a guy like that.  That was a joke for me and Ant.  Sorry.  That one we decided to just make ourselves laugh.  Yeah.  You're not going to get that one in Grand Rapids.  I'm sorry.  I didn't even get it.  I don't know who he is.  What a douche.  What a douche.  What a douche.  He wanted us to sign a contract in a cafeteria at a mall.  In a food court.  In a food court.  Right.  And he brought muscle with him.  He wanted to be somewhere public, somewhere safe. 
[00:16:30]  He brought muscle with him to pretty much intimidate us to sign this thing.  It's a story for another day.  It's a story for another day.  Thank God we did not go with Mr. Russo.  Small time.  Small time.  Yeah.  So I almost cursed.  I was going to say S.  Where the hell was I?  I'm sorry.  Went off a little tangent.  Subway.  A little tangent.  Yeah.  Subway Superman.  So he was on deal or no deal.  And he's in a bind with his agent. 
[00:17:00]  He.  Oh.  50%.  Right.  That's where I was.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  50%.  And he's saying that he had never signed this or he signed it under some kind of duress  or coercion.  Did they want to like get like a speaking fee or something?  I think he was mad that they're saying it was his family asking for certain fees.  And he's going, no, we weren't.  He was going to speak at a school, a little grammar school or something.  Yeah.  And they wanted a speaking fee.  Yeah.  He wanted some kind of fee.  I don't think he wants that.  But his agent did.  And his agent is getting 50% of everything he gets. 
[00:17:30]  And he doesn't want that to happen.  So litigation is going on there.  So he went on deal or no deal.  And they aired last night and apparently didn't do so hot.  That's what I'm hearing.  Well, he almost did well.  Well, if you know the game, I mean, he had three suitcases left.  Yep.  Briefcases, whatever.  Got the phone call from the banker.  The banker.  The banker offered him $300 and some odd thousand dollars to walk away.  To walk away.  And he said no because there was still a million dollars in one of the briefcases. 
[00:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  But there was also $10 or $25 in a briefcase and $10,000 in a briefcase.  That's what it was.  $25, $10,000 or a million.  Wow.  Banker saying $300 and some odd thousand dollars to walk away.  And this guy went on deal or no deal to buy a house basically.  Yeah.  He wanted to buy a house.  So obviously you know how this ends.  Yeah.  Because we wouldn't be talking about it if he won the $10,000.  He stuck with the briefcase that he had.  Oh. 
[00:18:30]  Walked away with $25.  $25.  $25.  There you go.  Hope you had a good time.  Oh, no.  Was he thinking like...  Get the moment where he finds out that he won $25.  Got to hear it.  Was he thinking this is like the moment because I'm the guy who jumped on the train and nothing  can stop me.  So it's got to work out for me.  I'm Subway Superman.  I can look through the briefcase and see how much money is in there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have x-ray vision.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  And as the news anchors report this story this morning, you can see in their face they're  like...  Because we all love sick stuff like that.  Yeah.  Most of us don't want to admit that, but we do.  People get a little jealous and it makes a better story that he didn't win.  I feel bad for him.  The guy did something that like the more we progress in society, the less selfless we  are.  I mean, that was really ballsy what he did.  I like him.  I used to think he was an ass and now he's kind of grown on me. 
[00:19:30]  I'm like, I feel bad for him.  He's an agent.  That's kind of...  You know something?  When you got three bags left and one's a million, one's 10 grand and one's 25 bucks, I guess  you got to take the shot.  The odds are with you.  You're crazy.  The odds are with you that you're going to walk away with at least 10 grand.  Dude, the banker said 300 and some odd thousand.  That's a lot of money.  Dollars!  Three to one odds on a million bucks.  When they offer you 50 grand, you go for the million.  But when they offer you 300,000...  Yeah, man.  That's a lot of money. 
[00:20:00]  You got to walk away.  I don't know.  That's pretty tempting.  I watched a deal of no deal where the guy had the million in his briefcase and didn't  walk away.  And then they walked away and they opened it and it was a million.  Oh, yeah.  Oof.  There's something about that show.  It's so simple, but I like it.  I watch it when I can.  Howie Mandel does a great job with it.  There's no answering questions.  It's the stupidest game show ever.  There's no intelligence where you have to know the Jeopardy or something.  It's just pick a briefcase.  All right.  Keep picking.  We'll be back after these words. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  We're back.  Pick.  Just keep picking.  It's like the dumbest show.  It just shows the talent of Howie Mandel because he keeps it going.  It makes it interesting.  I don't think anyone else could get that show where it's at.  300 grand.  Yeah.  And he walked away from that.  That's a lot of money to walk away.  That's stupid.  Yeah.  Eric is talking about that caught my fancy language.  The whales in Sacramento.  Oh, my God.  They're trying to chase him back out to sea.  Right.  Well, they got spooked and they turned around. 
[00:21:00]  They were making their way back to the ocean.  Have you been following this story?  Oh, yeah.  Some kind of Sacramento Canal or Sacramento River.  I didn't even know this thing existed.  They were 90 miles up this river.  River slash canal.  I think it then turns into a canal or something.  And, yeah, they were 90 miles in.  And found them with prop marks on their back.  Really?  Apparently, a couple of boats, a couple of pleasure craft had run them over.  And they got lost in this little river canal thingy. 
[00:21:30]  And they're trying to chase him out with Coast Guard boats.  And apparently they doubled back.  Well, they turned around and they were making some really good progress.  And then something really scared them as they went under one of these bridges.  And that turned them around.  And I was just thinking, man, the attention we give to, like, whales that are just a little bit lost is just amazing.  Really?  Is whales or dolphins that get lost?  Right.  If the news picks up on it and it's around the clock coverage, if you watch CNN or something, they'll give you an update every hour where the whales are and stuff. 
[00:22:00]  And we freak out at whales that are lost.  We just suck as humans.  We really do.  We want to feel really good about ourselves, I think.  Like we're helping a fellow mammal that is smarter than he looks.  I don't get those feel-good stories, man.  Because why wouldn't you just, maybe as a news organization or as a society or as humans in general, just all of a sudden decide to help, like, a poor family or something?  Yeah.  Make believe there are whales that are just wandering around through their lives and don't know what's going on. 
[00:22:30]  It's a little pod of whales, and they're trying to make their way from the homeless shelter back to a house.  Right.  Why not just knock on some homeless family's door and say, hey, today's your lucky day.  We're going to help you.  We're going to help you like we would help the whales, and we're going to broadcast it all over the world for you.  I hope the homeless families don't have doors.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean.  Poor families, I mean.  Not homeless door.  It was a brilliant analogy, though.  But no.  Line up to the door.  Right, right. 
[00:23:00]  It's like Wile E. Coyote used to set up the door, and it was just a door that bugs would knock on.  It could be a door.  Well, a refrigerator box, you know, they've got kind of a front door area.  I mean, a poor family.  Yeah.  And then say, this is your lucky day, and then give them the coverage you would give the dumb whales.  Yeah.  Then I'd feel good as a human being.  They try to make their way back, but they keep getting diverted by the bar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dad just can't get to work.  Trying to get them past this bar, and oh, the family's turning around.  We can't keep them in the right direction.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  We're just getting warmed up.  We've got lots to do today.  We'll get the clip.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, Danny is fast.  Oh, look at that, Danny.  Oh, boy.  We've got to take a break, though.  Subway Hero on Deal or No Deal after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on 92.3 Free FM.  Hey, good morning.  Thanks for checking us out this morning.  If you've got something for the show, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:24:00]  In a little bit, we're going to give away tickets to the 0&8 Traveling Virus Comedy Show at Jones Beach on June 16th.  Stick around for that.  Getting very excited.  We're, what, three weeks out, something like that?  Something like that?  Wow.  Coming up.  Three weeks from Saturday, anyway.  All right.  We've got the audio of Subway Hero on Deal or No Deal.  Losing a million dollars.  Yeah, poor bastard. 
[00:24:30]  25 bucks.  Here's the moment.  I am so excited and nervous and scared and everything all in one right now.  Who is that?  Who is that?  The hot broads.  Yeah.  Their whole job was to kind of look good when Deal or No Deal started.  They all wear the same dress and stuff and they're just fine specimens.  But somewhere along the line, they decided that it would be really good if they started talking. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, no.  So Subway Hero has picked the case, I guess, and she's about to open it.  Yeah.  But she has a little back and forth with everybody.  I'm so excited.  Are you?  Yeah.  Great.  14.  I am so excited and nervous and scared and everything all in one right now.  I really hope that you are our first contestant to welcome a million dollars. 
[00:25:30]  No one's done it yet?  Wow.  No one has won the million.  $25.  No, because most people, you have to go pretty much all the way to the end to win the million dollars.  They back out.  And they back out because the offers get so good.  You're stupid not to take the offer.  When they say to him, what do you want to do?  Do we have that where he makes his decision?  His choice.  Yeah, where's his choice?  No, the audience usually goes with it like they get all excited for that. 
[00:26:00]  Woo, yeah.  Remember, the banker offered 300 some odd thousand dollars and he said no because he wants to try to win the million.  So he picked his briefcase and in the briefcase could be $10, $25, $10,000 or a million dollars.  Yeah.  Okay.  Dummy.  Anything.  $25, $10,000.  $25, $10,000.  That's all we're looking to see. 
[00:26:30]  That's all I'm looking to see.  You ready to see it?  Yeah, you don't want to see the million in this game.  Oh, come on.  I can see it.  Open the game.  Open it.  Come on.  Woo, $25.  That's gotta be $25.  $25.  Come on, baby.  Heavy up.  It's gotta be $25.  Even her heart is beating $25.  She's so scared.  Tell me if I cannot go.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  I'm fine.  I'm just.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm fine.  I'm just...  I'm fine.  I'm just.  It's okay.  Yeah.  Did you see that, jerk?  We're cakes for nothing. 
[00:27:30]  How'd you like to mow my lawn, huh?  Well, yeah.  Oh, is that funny?  Well, obviously it was the million dollars in that case, and...  That means he wasn't getting it.  He wasn't going to get the million dollars, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Halfway rebound.  Go.  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'd tell you something.  How did that not go in? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, how did that not go in?  Ah, we'll go old school for everybody.  Hold on a minute.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  Yeah, yeah, well.  So then, of course, Howie has to kind of make everyone feel better.  Feel a little better about things.  You know what?  You've exemplified what a hero is.  Really? 
[00:28:30]  And it took a lot of guts.  Hello?  Phone call from the banker.  Okay.  Final offer of the game, $5,000.  No.  No.  No.  No deal.  No deal.  All right.  Two cases left in play.  You try this one?  So he said no deal to $5,000.  So now he's either going to win $25 or $10,000.  He's probably shaking and saying, all right, baby, $10,000. 
[00:29:00]  I can get $10,000.  Yeah, $10,000 is good for me.  Yeah, you know.  That's good.  And he's probably thinking what he could do with $10,000.  Yeah, I got $10,000.  And I'll, you know, I can't buy a house with it, but maybe I can make some renovations  around the place.  I'll fix up the bathroom.  This is left in play.  You chose this one?  You want to switch them?  I mean, you want to keep them.  So you are going home with the case you originally chose.  You are going home with $25,000. 
[00:29:30]  You are going home with $25,000.  You got the $10,000.  Okay.  Let me tell you something.  You are a hero.  Let me tell you something.  You're a hero.  That's right.  Yeah, like he wants to continue hearing that.  No, at this point, he wants cold hard cash. 
[00:30:00]  Would you want to be a hero or a millionaire?  Right.  Yeah, that's not a tough decision, is it now?  I'd be an ass of myself.  Yeah.  Was that supposed to be some kind of sick joke?  So basically, doesn't the game start with $10?  Like, I think it's the second lowest total. 
[00:30:30]  It's the second lowest?  God, you can walk away with less than $25?  I think it starts at $10.  I think there's $10 in one of the cases.  You think he's spinning that to his family?  Go, hey, look, we'll go to the diner.  I mean, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  $25.  See, there's no God.  There is no God.  My name's Fred.  I'm a man.  Like you.  You can't even get your cape washed for $25.  Not your cape.  Yeah.  You can't get his superhero outfit dry cleaned. 
[00:31:00]  You can't get it dry cleaned.  Ah, that's great.  Just a fine moment yesterday on TV.  People really want to see people lose, though.  They do.  People want to see people lose.  Whenever you get these game shows and you get somebody that can either go on or give up  and walk away with the money, what do you want to see them do?  Go on and risk it.  Not so they can win.  You want to see them lose.  That's how it is.  That's how it is on those game shows. 
[00:31:30]  I don't sit there rooting for anybody.  I do.  I don't care.  I hope they lose.  They really do.  I root for them because I know that losing just stinks.  Go for it.  Go for it.  Yeah, come on.  You can do it.  The whole audience is doing the same thing.  Yeah, go for it.  Go.  Go.  Okay, I'm going to go for it.  And then they lose and the audience is like, what an idiot.  Right.  I wouldn't have done that.  We were hoping you were going to go for it.  Only an idiot would really go for it.  You see the subway superman in the green room handing out a $12.50 to the agent. 
[00:32:00]  $12.50 to the agent.  $6 to the IRS.  Yeah, he's going to pay the tax on the $25.  He's walking away with six bucks.  Six and a quarter.  Honey, you want to pack our new ports?  We're going to pack our new ports.  That's it.  Amanda, thank you.  It's done.  Amanda, let her get on the air today.  Amanda in New York.  Amanda.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  Hi.  How are you doing?  I'm good.  I'm graduating today.  Oh.  You are?  We're talking about that.  From what?  I'm ready right now.  From what?  FIT.  Hey, congratulations. 
[00:32:30]  What are you going to do for a living?  I want to be an artist, an illustrator.  An illustrator?  Well, good luck.  You're not going to be a tracer, are you?  No.  Okay.  All right.  Awesome.  Well, congrats.  What are you going to illustrate?  I want to do like CD covers and stuff.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  Maybe we could illustrate a better phone call.  Yeah.  What do you got, Amanda?  Could you draw something interesting and describe it?  One penny, not $10. 
[00:33:00]  It starts at a penny?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She corrected us there.  It does start with a penny.  I think like either $1 or $5.  All right.  So.  And it goes to $10.  Well, let's be honest.  Five bucks.  Does it really matter if it's $25 or a penny?  If I say that to his family, look, it could have been $10 or it could have been a penny.  No, that's a good point.  Even for a college kid, $25 is nothing.  All right, Amanda.  You didn't get that many beers with that in the city.  Well, congratulations and good luck to you.  All right?  Thank you.  All right.  Apparently, Chrysler gave him a Jeep. 
[00:33:30]  They keep giving him stuff, so it's nice to see him not get stuff.  Got a consolation prize.  Exactly.  God.  How is an agent trying to take this guy's money?  I mean, they're just.  Because they're.  Yeah.  They really are.  They're garbage.  Agents, in most cases, are people who just can't do what you do, so they've found a way  to make themselves useful.  They're vultures, most of them.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey there, Mike. 
[00:34:00]  I wanted to comment on watching people lose.  Okay.  Because I absolutely love it.  The other day, I was just cruising through the channels, and I caught this lottery losers  thing on A&E.  And I suggest that you find a repeat of it.  These people win hundreds of millions, and their lives crumble.  And I think it's the most fantastic thing on television.  Yeah, because they don't understand that the money's not going to last forever.  They don't understand taxes.  They don't understand financial planning. 
[00:34:30]  They don't understand any of that.  There was one guy who walked away with, like, $313 million.  Yeah.  He already was a business millionaire, and he would get, like, a quarter of a million.  He'd leave in his truck and just get robbed and drugged at strip clubs, and his whole life  fell apart.  And I found it as outstanding.  What's wrong with these people?  Another guy bought an airplane and, like, 14 semis and a ranch, and then developed a  mess habit.  And I just got a kick out of it.  A mess habit?  Oh, we got to watch the show. 
[00:35:00]  14 labs he's got.  It was on A&E?  Yeah, it's an A&E documentary or an E true life doc.  I'm not sure if it was E or A&E.  All right.  Our research department will find out, and we'll let everyone know.  A lot of research department.  It's the best thing ever.  I've been on every store trying to find DVD of it.  I just want it on repeat in my car forever.  All right, cool.  We'll find it.  Thank you so much there, Mike.  No problem.  Take it easy.  Yeah, I love when people lose.  I love, like, World Series footage when, you know, let's say whoever wins, and then 
[00:35:30]  they go to the losing dugout, and you got grown men pretty much crying in the dugout.  I can't get enough of that stuff.  They can't leave the field?  No, they can't.  They just sit there.  They just sit there.  Everyone else went into the locker room, and they got to sit there and try to soak in  the moment, and they just sit there thinking about what could have been, and they're crying,  and it's like, dude, get your ass off the bench and get into the locker room.  And you at home, you're supposed to feel sorry for this person.  It's like, they're multi-millionaires.  You're just laughing. 
[00:36:00]  I just laugh.  I just enjoy it.  Let's say hi to Ray in New York.  Ray, what's going on?  Hey.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to point out if anybody noticed that his wife pretended to faint when they  found, they uncovered the million dollars on the stage.  Yes.  Pretended to faint?  And he told them, no, don't take the deal.  And when everybody got near her to see if she was in case, she was like, I'm okay.  I'm okay.  Yeah.  Well, I got to see some of the video of that.  Yeah, I saw her faint.  I don't know if she was a faint. 
[00:36:30]  She was just being a silly goose.  Also, the documentary the guy was talking about, it wasn't any true Hollywood story.  It was called Lotto Curse.  Lotto Curse.  All right, cool.  A and E True Hollywood Story.  All right, thank you.  It's E True Hollywood Story or A and E.  Ah, we'll figure it out.  Tom in Jersey, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you doing?  Real good.  Listen, I watched that show last night.  I was absolutely flabbergasted for the first time ever.  The audience was screaming at this guy, take the deal, take the deal, when they offered  him the $300,000.  I was screaming to myself, my wife and I were going nuts. 
[00:37:00]  It was unbelievable.  That's a very generous offer.  That's a lot of money.  Did they groan when he passed on it?  I don't know how you do that.  The audience just go like, oh, no, you idiot.  All right, thank you, Tom.  I survived a train.  I can, no, you can.  Yeah.  Buy some tokens.  Speaking of us surviving a train.  MetroCard's stupid for the month.  Yeah.  Maybe someone can help me out here.  I saw a video.  I'm not sure on what video site, but they end up on all the sites of a guy filming himself  as a train rolls over him. 
[00:37:30]  Did you see this one yet?  No.  I want to know if it's real.  Steve's the expert on what's real and what's fake.  Maybe we could talk about that.  On the internet video sites.  You see the train coming, but I'm wondering if it's some trickery.  I'm sure.  Where he lays down the tracks with the camera and then maybe gets up and leaves the camera  there or something.  Well, here's some.  And then after the train passes, he could actually go back and get up with the camera.  You know what I mean?  A quick edit and you wouldn't know the difference. 
[00:38:00]  Because a train would easily go over a camera.  Well, Steve said it was real, but I looked at it closer and it's five men in a train outfit.  They're all going choo-choo.  And they're just running.  No, it's real.  I verified it.  It has the foundry logo of truth on it.  Here it is.  Guy lets train run over him.  That's where you can find it.  But you never see the guy.  It's his point of view through a camcorder.  Yeah.  So that's silly.  So you're looking down the train tracks.  Yep.  Train's coming. 
[00:38:30]  So the guy.  Is it rolling around the bend?  So this angle makes it look like.  Very good.  This angle makes it look like he's laying on the tracks with the camcorder.  Okay.  Still waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting.  This is in real time.  Thanks, Iraq.  You could have fast forward a little bit.  Iraq.  Here comes the train.  And over him.  That camera is laying there.  It is not being held.  You think it's some trickery? 
[00:39:00]  Well, the camera's definitely not being held.  Really?  Well, how did he pull that one off?  It spins around.  It's too much.  Dude.  That's on something.  How did he?  How was he able?  That camera is on some type of device.  How was he able to pan it a complete 180 degrees?  With a servo.  That thing is definitely on something.  All right.  Iraq, will you play the video out?  I want to see if the guy gets up or something.  You stopped it right after.  The spin is too mechanical.  That turn is too mechanical. 
[00:39:30]  And then it's on something else where it rises up after the train.  All right.  Hold on.  I want to see if it was real, you would see a hand or something by now.  Fake, fakey, fake, fake.  The camera's so low, when the train is going over, the camera is looking up.  And to the right part of the screen, you can see, like, the bolts in the track.  And there's no way if a guy was holding it, it would be that low.  Yeah.  And how could he spin around?  What's he on?  His belly just spinning completely at 180?  You know what?  I didn't see the whole video.  It's definitely fake because at the end of it, you don't see the guy whatsoever. 
[00:40:00]  No.  See, they're stupid.  At that point, whoever's filming this should run on the tracks and make it look like, here  I am.  Like, show his face or something.  And then he's got a hit video on his hand.  That's why only three out of five stars.  We're not buying into this.  All the comments say fake.  Look how low it is.  You see the bolts to the right?  There's no way that would be on that.  It goes.  Now, look at this turn.  How is a guy holding a camera going to turn the camera like this without you seeing his  legs if he's turned that way?  Or turning his whole body, which would then cut his legs off?  All right.  There you go.  I didn't see the whole video.  It's a very mechanical move where it stops. 
[00:40:30]  It's on some kind of device, and then it raises up on the device also.  And the raise up is making it look like the guy stood up after the train went over him.  See, the guy blew it.  All he had to do was come back into frame somehow and show his hand, his face, or whatever after  the camera raises up.  Phony baloney.  That's what I say.  Close to a million views on Break.com.  Guy's doing something right.  People.  Do you have a video that's...  Oh, you do have a video?  Yes, I do.  You're Vista?  I am the Vista guy. 
[00:41:00]  I'm the guy that puts the Vista disc through the shredder.  That's me.  Yes, folks.  It's me.  You had over a million views on that, right?  Yeah.  Hey, let's say hi to Mike in Pennsylvania.  Mike, what's up?  Well, I'm Tub Boy.  Tub Boy.  It was sexy.  Mike.  Professor Anthony got that right.  You don't even see the guy's feet.  It was like they went out there and dug a hole or something like that and then put the  camera in there, robotics, whatever they use on it.  But you never see the guy one bit, not even a little tiny portion of him. 
[00:41:30]  We agree.  Yeah, it's some kind of radio-controlled gizmo he's got there.  It's definitely robotics, sir.  It's not magic.  Yeah.  You got that right.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Godspeed.  What about me?  It's my real birthday tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  That's it.  Oh, what's that thing?  Thank you, Mike.  Look at that it is.  Yeah, we're getting smarter with the videos online, though.  Although people are still buying into the hot tub girl having her you-know-what in the  hot tub video.  They're still buying into it.  Like, that's real. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, that one is still a lot of people on the fence about that one.  And we studied that video.  Oh, for hours.  Hours.  Over and over.  Our forensics team took it apart.  They got some kind of apparatus that is shooting some color dye into the hot tub.  But people are still buying it.  Some Nestle's quick.  It has four million views.  Four and a half million views.  That is amazing.  There it is again.  The girl in like a sweater in a hot tub.  Why would she have a sweater on while everyone else has a bikini tops? 
[00:42:30]  To hide the gizmo?  Yeah.  That's pumping out whatever that is.  How did I not notice?  She's wearing a parka and a hat in a hot tub.  Right.  That's so stupid.  Everyone else is in bikini tops and she's got some kind of covering.  Yeah.  That you would never wear in a hot tub because they're covering up all sorts of tubes and  stuff so they could get this liquid into the hot tub in front of her.  Covering up the dinty more stew delivery system.  Right.  And the acting is just beyond awful. 
[00:43:00]  And she refuses to get out of it.  Yeah.  She's kind of sitting there with her.  Wouldn't you be the first one to jump out of the hot tub?  I wouldn't be soaking my feet in it like she is.  That's for sure.  I'd be head first bobbing.  She's got her feet in there like it's Epsom salt.  I don't know this one.  Let's go to Billy in Rhode Island.  Billy, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I don't know if you guys have seen this yet, but I think it was on A&E also.  But they did a thing about that game show with the whammies. 
[00:43:30]  Remember that one?  Yep.  Press your luck.  Press your luck.  Right.  Yeah.  Press your luck.  No whammies.  No whammies.  No whammies.  Big money.  Big money.  No whammies.  And stop on a new car.  I hated that show.  You know what that reminds me of?  That show reminds me of being homesick from school.  That show feels like I should be somewhere else.  It's like 1130 in the morning.  Yeah, exactly.  Because you would never just watch it.  I remember summers watching That, Price is Right, and Dukes of Hazzard re-roads. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  But so anyways, this guy goes on that show, and apparently he was some super geek, and  he had recorded the show on like a beta recorder, I guess.  That's what they had back then.  And he memorized the pattern of how the whammies go, and the guy figured it out, figured out  when to hit the buzzer every time.  He scanned them out of like $250,000, and they had the footage, and they had a thing on  E about it.  But it's just priceless.  The host and the 200 contestants are just, their faces, it's just priceless. 
[00:44:30]  You guys can find that.  Yeah, this guy figured out a pattern.  He knew exactly when to hit that button to make it stop on anything but a whammy.  Oh, that's brilliant.  And he just built them.  Kept going and going.  And I think the reason he stopped is he just got tired.  I hit an arm injury?  Yeah.  Guy walked away with a lot of money.  Dude, does he actually admit that he built them?  Yeah.  Oh, I guess it was legal, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Nothing about, you know, if you could figure out a pattern on there, it's their stupid fault. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Billy, Rhode Island.  All right, guys.  All right, cool.  Bye, Bill.  Right on.  This is coming in on the Instant Feedback.  Rambo Trailer.  Rambo Trailer.  Rambo Trailer.  Oh, yeah.  And big, huge capital letters.  We'll talk about the Rambo Trailer next.  I haven't seen it.  Anthony saw it.  Oh, yeah.  And he says it's hilarious.  And also, after the break, we might have to go with this news tease today.  And fresh out of rehab, Britney Spears has new cravings. 
[00:45:30]  What she's begging doctors to inject her with.  Really?  Talent?  That's one way to go with it.  Way to go clean, Jimmy.  Because that's not the first thing I was thinking of.  No.  No.  And fresh out of rehab, Britney Spears has new cravings.  What she's begging doctors to inject her with.  I know.  Yeah?  Yeah, a big ****.  Right? 
[00:46:00]  Just a big, fat **** full of **** to put in her **** while she **** his ****.  In her ****.  And then **** right on his ****.  Oh.  And just inject **** all in **** when she **** in his **** on her **** with their ****.  And then just a big mess, all of them, both of their ****.  All right? 
[00:46:30]  This is called fun with the beep, kids.  And go ****.  In her, on her ****.  I love that part of it.  Just grab the doctor's **** to make sure it's ****, and then **** all the **** into  your **** with his **** right up ****.  Isn't that what it is? 
[00:47:00]  Why?  I thought I had the story accurate.  In her, at her, at her, in the, on her, in, at the, with his, in her, on the, with a  lot of, all over her, I'll give you an edit button.  That bit makes me laugh every freaking time.  Yeah, it was Michael Larson.  He won $110,000 on, uh, Press Your Luck. 
[00:47:30]  Now, you, uh, you gotta remember, Press Your Luck, uh, uh, wow, that, uh, I'm trying to  think how far back that was.  Mid-70s, right?  Uh, when he pulled off that day in 1984.  So, just $110,000 back in 1984.  That was 84?  That is a lot of money.  Like, $2.50 now.  That's a lot of money now, obviously, but I'm just saying it's even way more money in  1984.  All right, we gotta take a break.  We'll continue, uh, what?  Oh, I thought you had some of your, uh, no? 
[00:48:00]  Okay.  And Anthony's got the story of the day.  The train story is classic.  We were talking about trains.  We'll continue with trains.  That's a Wile E. Coyote moment.  Sure.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  On 92.3.  Free of them.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's happening?  Good morning.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:48:30]  Don't forget, it's, uh, Rock Scream Tuesday.  I heard about this.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rock Scream.  I saw that in my email last night.  I'm like, what the hell is going on?  I don't know.  Gotta love Rock Scream Tuesday.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Yes, man.  You want to try one?  Maybe later.  But Steve has just been very excited about this for months.  Yeah, I understand.  This is...  Steve wants everybody to try to do a Rock Scream, I guess.  Yeah.  Because that video is up on YouTube or wherever the hell else it is break.  And, um, uh, it's just some, like, 80s guy doing a Rock Scream.  It's an 80s guy from a band no one heard of except for Steve. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, Steve knows the guy?  He knows the band, I guess.  They probably used to tour with Foundry.  Yes, with Foundry.  Yeah!  It's Rock Scream Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rock Scream Tuesday stinks.  What band is this, Steve?  It's, uh, uh, the guy's name is Jim Gillette and he used to sing in a band called Nitro back in the 80s.  Yeah, Nitro! 
[00:50:00]  Dude, you're going to see Nitro tonight.  Oh, yeah.  And why was he doing that?  Because he was just one of these guys that didn't make any money in the band Nitro,  so realized he had a, he could make a living teaching other people how to scream like that.  He had a six octave vocal range.  And, you know, he was one of these guys that could shatter wine glasses with his voice  and decided that he would make his money teaching people how to scream  because he was making absolutely nothing.  How many octaves could you hit?  Uh, not six.  How many?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  What the hell does he have in the front of his, in the front of his pants, more importantly? 
[00:50:30]  Look at this video.  See, he is the, he is the definitive 80s rock guy.  Wait, start that video again.  This was every tool that was at every local club around Long Island.  It's on our website, this video, but there he is.  Oh, God.  We have virtual armadillos.  Look, man, if you want to.  If you want to pack something in the front of your pants, you've got to make it look like,  uh, how can I say this?  It's human.  That you've got more than, uh.  Oh, God.  More than one big you-know-what. 
[00:51:00]  And I'm not, uh, how do you say this on regular radio?  Very carefully.  Yeah.  Well, let's just put it this way.  Mick Jagger knew how to make it look like a complete bang.  Bang.  Like, uh, anatomically correct.  Right.  It's got to look.  Jim Gillette makes it look like there may be a problem.  Like he's got some kind of tumor.  Right.  It's elephantitis.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  You gotta get the...  It's a good...  He's got a good...  It's Rock Spring Tuesday.  Well, Steve, I mean, Steve, you've got to give us one.  Oh, I can.  I have to have some warm liquids.  All right.  All right.  I'm sure we know what that is.  Yeah, no kidding.  But everybody's got to do it because we practice this in the office after you guys leave.  Danny's doing it.  Fan is actually very good at this.  Fan can do a good Rock Scream?  Fan can do a really good Rock Scream. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  Hey, he's Rock Scream.  Set up the mic over there and let's do Rock Scream Tuesday.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Did you see this video clip?  What the hell is that?  Apparently, the guy is rolling out...  What is that that he's rolling out?  Go ahead there, Steve.  It's like a tarp at a baseball field.  At a baseball field, he drops it on the ground, kicks it, you know, kicks it to unroll it, 
[00:52:30]  and right at the end, as it's unrolling the final little one foot, a kitten was in the  roll and pops out of the thing.  Ta-da!  All dusty.  Ta-da!  That's going to be your video of the day.  Every day now, we have to have the video of the day on the news, right?  That one's going to make it all over the news because it's adorable.  It's so cute.  It involves a kitten.  All right.  So now, Fan, how can you do a Rock Scream?  How did you acquire this talent? 
[00:53:00]  I don't think I did.  You didn't know that you could do it?  Sam's giving me a thumbs up, which probably means I'm not going to fall on my face.  Oh.  Oh, we need a little echo for these guys, right?  Just a little bit, a little bit.  Sam, Mr. Nickelodeon?  Yeah.  We'll get to that at some point.  We all have our respective talents.  Yes, we do.  What do you mean?  Oh, wait till you see this.  Wow, wow, wow.  We found some dirt on Sam.  Oh, yeah.  It's pretty good.  That's...  All right.  Can we get a little echo for the boys?  On the...  Oh, nice.  Yeah, a little echo.  You need echo. 
[00:53:30]  Very good.  A lot of people don't understand.  The echo is what makes the 80s Rock Scream.  You can't do it on a dry mic.  It just doesn't work.  Is there echo on that mic?  Checking this mic for echo.  Of course not.  Why would there be?  No, there's...  Say it again.  Hi, I'm Fan.  Oh, oh, you're getting a little reverb.  Yeah.  That's good.  There it is.  All right, that's good enough.  All right, see you first.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Rock Scream.  Now that's... 
[00:54:00]  All right, that's the original guy.  What's his name?  That's Jim Gillette.  Jim Gillette.  From Nitro.  Nitro.  Nitro.  And now Steve Carr.  At the Nassau Coliseum, it's Nitro.  The guy actually, he's a mixed martial arts fighter now.  Of course he is.  Is he?  Yeah, he...  What's the guy's name?  Gracie?  I don't know what that...  Hoist Gracie?  Oh, yeah.  It's a little guy named Gracie.  I bet he makes that sound when Hoist puts him in one of those holes. 
[00:54:30]  His testicles are split by eight feet.  All right, Steve.  All right, Steve.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  Here comes Steve Carr from Foundry.  Okay.  Yeah.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  He finishes off with an ow.  He hurt himself.  The Rock Scream hurt him.  Everyone's laughing. 
[00:55:00]  Danny's holding his chest.  That's awful.  All right.  Danny's up.  I was hoping for a vocal cord to pop across the room.  Oh, it almost did.  Hey, Rock, stop potting behind that screen over there.  I like the way you started.  You don't have to start like that low.  It's just Rock Scream.  That guy wanted to show his range.  I think he was showing off.  Well, you have to mimic the Rock Scream.  You could just kind of go,  do one of those, you know.  Yeah, you don't have to do Jim Gillette.  Oh, but that's how you have to do the Jim Gillette thing.  You can freestyle your own Rock Scream. 
[00:55:30]  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  Yeah, freestyle it.  Don't copy it.  All right.  What do you do?  You're a cover band for a scream.  Put your notebook down.  I'm going to rock star holds a notebook.  Now do your own.  Plenty of them.  Your own Rock Scream.  Do your own like you, Stephen Carr, Pendulum.  Let's go.  Woo!  All right, that sounded like Fish Night at Prison.  When they bring in the new fish.  It sounded like Fay Wray.  I was improvising.  All right, who's next?  You didn't get the good vibrato. 
[00:56:00]  No, I didn't.  Yeah, see, that's very important to the Rock Scream.  You're right.  Judges, no, look, you're getting fives.  You're getting fours.  There's a one six.  You're no Jim Gillette.  No, you're not.  I'm Nitro.  This is what more suits you, Steve.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Right in Jillum.  Who's up next?  We need another Rock Scream.  Danny.  Danny.

[01:13:00]  but then  she  all  over  the  we'll find  out later  this morning  yeah  also  we forgot to  talk about this  Rambo the new  trailer  Anthony saw it  on YouTube  I guess  he's doing  another Rambo  why wouldn't 
[01:13:30]  he  he made a deal  it was like  I'll do Rocky  but I want to  do Rambo as  well  so Stallone  wanted to do  Rambo  of course he did  what else is he  gonna do  what do you think  it's um  he's injecting  steroids  he's 60  he wants to  he wants to  continue doing  this  how many  how many  Rambos  three or four  how many Rambos  were made  how many  sucked all of  them  three  three  what do you  think he's  gonna call this  Rambo four  that sounds  too silly  what do you  assume he  would call  this  well is he  gonna keep  in the  Rocky  tradition  and think  that he 
[01:14:00]  somehow has  dignity  at his  age  by just  naming the  character  the movie  the original  it is  John  Rambo  coming to  a theater  near you  yes  look for  future  movies  by Sylvester  Stallone  Raymond  Tango  will be  one  Marion  Cabretti  the sequel  to be coming  out soon  and of course  Freddie  Heflin  that's from  Copland  the guy  thinks  if you just  name the  movie 
[01:14:30]  the character's  name  that it  wraps it  all up  and it  kind of  gives him  it lets  him do  this  and it's  more artistic  than it is  just a sequel  that's it  I just need to  move on  he tried to  move on  Joseph Dread  that was his  name on that one  he tried to  move on  no one was  buying it  so now he's  going back  to you know  Magistrate  Dread  why can't  he just  do another  character  we  John  Spartan  he tried 
[01:15:00]  Jimmy  but Copland  was great  it was  great  I love  this character  in Copland  anybody else  was beating  down his  door there  so what's  the Rambo  trailer all  about  and who's  he fighting  now  is he fighting  his inner  demons  man  apparently  he's fighting  the barber  because he  still has  the mullet  on his head  from the  80s  and there's  this peace  corps group  I guess  some type  of peace  nicks  and there's 
[01:15:30]  some kind  of war  going on  in Burma  is the war  being fought  inside his  inner soul  man  yeah man  where's  the real  war  being  fought  it's not  over  I ain't  start this  I ain't  drop  for his  blood  what  it's in  Burma  oh it's in  Burma  yeah  and uh  some kind  of  you know  what  it's  it's also  in his  head  man  we all  know the 
[01:16:00]  real war  is being  fought  in Rambo's  head  man  where the  hell  is Burma  are we  getting that  safe  I don't  know  where it  is  but  wherever  it  is  you better  bring a  good  supply  of  body  bags  Burma  what the  hell  did  Burma  ever do  to us  no one  goes to  Burma  eventually  I think  we talked  about  on the  show  we're  just  gonna  have  to  fight  imaginary  people  from  imaginary  countries  just to  play it  safe  play it  safe  the reviews  are in  already  it's 
[01:16:30]  over  Jenny  it's  over  Jenny  it's  over  nothing  is  over  nothing  you just  don't  turn it  off  please  turn it  off  I will  give myself  a pat  on the  back  from the  day that  stuff  started  I  despised  it  I  never  liked  Rambo  he's a  cornball  Rambo  is a  cornball  he's got a  headband  oh he's still  got it  oh he's awful  you Olivia Newton  John 
[01:17:00]  stop it  so what's  the trailer  all about  well  I haven't  seen it  yet  on the  video  site  this  group  of  people  somehow  approach  Rambo  to help  them out  because  there's  all kinds  of  problems  in Burma  and Rambo  is just  like  hanging out  it's a hot  bit of  activity  huh  Burma  he's hanging  out down  there  and he  doesn't want  to get  involved  anymore  and he  talks  real low  at the  beginning  and just  kind of  you know  I don't  do that  and some 
[01:17:30]  woman's  trying to  convince him  and she  can't convince  him  and they  go off  and they  get taken  prisoner  by the  evil  Burmese  I guess  Burmese  I don't  know  and then  Rambo  of course  has to  go in  and free  them  so Rambo  goes in  and one  thing I must  say  the trailer  I saw  more graphic  violence  than I've  ever seen  in any  this rivals  Saving Private 
[01:18:00]  Ryan's opening  scene  no kidding  it just  is nothing  but Rambo  hacking people  to pieces  with machine  guns  knives  and his  bare hands  he pulls  out some  man's throat  with his  bare hand  and this is  just a trailer  yeah  and then  he jumps  on the  back  of this  jeep  type  vehicle  that has  a mounted  machine gun  spins it  around to  the driver  and at  point blank  range  pulls the 
[01:18:30]  trigger  and you  just see  pieces of  meat  flying out  of the  driver's seat  so it's a lot  more graphic  than the  original  Rambo's  were even  though you  know when  he shot  that one  guy  with the  arrow  and he  blew him  out of  his boots  you didn't  really see  much though  this one  is just  graphic  graphic  violent  decapitations  he disembowels  the guy  with his  Rambo knife  so it's a lot  more graphic  if they keep  that whole  theme  of just  graphic 
[01:19:00]  violence  I think  it might  do alright  is there  any catch  phrases  in the  trailer  not in  the trailer  I didn't  really catch  any  but I'm  sure in  the movie  there will  be  please  you're  going to  have to  bring one  other thing  what's that  a swollen  prostate  let's  get a  cat  in  Jersey  cat  what's  up  hey  how  you  doing  I  just  want to  let  you know  that Burma  is now  called  Myanmar  that's why  you don't  know where  it is  Myanmar  Myanmar  Myanmar  how is  that  it's 
[01:19:30]  Burma  all that  kind of  stuff  alrighty  so why  is it  called  Burma  in the  trailer  it  used to  be  called  Burma  so  you know  hardcore  Rambo  is still  calling it  Burma  yeah  because  you know  he's old  yeah  don't want to  confuse  people  is it a  hotbed of  activity  this place  it is  look it up  it's pretty  violent  yeah  I would  assume  well  it's  India's  to the  left  and China  to the  right  and then  you got  Thailand  kind of  southeast  right  it's just  a  kind of  a  area of 
[01:20:00]  the world  there  and then  you got  a lot  of  conflict  then you got  the Bay  of Bengal  Bengal  to its  southwest  oh wait  we got a  catchphrase  Steve  what is it  the catchphrase  from the Rambo  trailer is  when you're  pushed  killing is  as easy  as breathing  it's a little  long for a  catchphrase  it really  it's a  catch paragraph  when you're  pushed and  you're tired  and you've  done your  best  semicolon  wow that's 
[01:20:30]  a little  rough for a  catchphrase  that's not  going to be  easy to put  on a t-shirt  no  so  alright  well  and it  said  John Rambo  at the end  of the trailer  and then it  said  attacking  theaters  soon  ew  yeah  yeah  she also  attacked  his agent  and script  supervisor  is there  any  can we  share the  trailer  or is it  not worth  playing  because  it's  mostly  music 
[01:21:00]  probably  yeah  I think  it's  mostly  dramatic  music  and  explosions  and  and him  you know  doing a  rock  scream  Rambo  rock  scream  Tuesday  alright  we're not  going to  watch it  no we're not  going to  watch a movie  trailer on the  radio  that's just  plain silly  Steve points  like look  watch it  can you still  play it  I think you  just don't  turn the volume  up  alright  anyway  moving on  so go check  out the Rambo  trailer 
[01:21:30]  it's up there  on the video  sites  break.com  has it  that's what  we really  want to  promote  is break.com  you see that  guy come  apart like  that  alright  Anthony  had the  story of  the morning  it was  my favorite  I heard it  as I was  driving in  on the news  station  on the  news station  here in  New York  and I was  laughing  yeah really  fast  it's a slow  news day  I mean  they're talking  about dumb  stuff today  like Viagra  could help  with jet  lag  really  yeah  that's the  big get  on the  local news 
[01:22:00]  jet lag  Viagra  could prevent  jet lag  Viagra  the little  blue pill  that transformed  the treatment  of impotence  impotence  impotence  may help  prevent jet lag  the impotency  scientists  discovered the  new potential  use in  experiments  on disturbances  to sleep  patterns  the drug  helped  hamsters  recover more  quickly  when their  sleep patterns  were disrupted  by bright light  researchers  believe it  could benefit  some air  passengers  on red-eye  flights  although tests 
[01:22:30]  so far  show  the benefits  only apply  on flights  going  eastwards  it'll be a  red-eye flight  for the  female companion  flying with  the gentleman  oops  bunch of guys  at baggage  claim with  tents in  their pants  yeah  this just  doesn't seem  like a really  good idea  now does it  you could just  put your luggage  on it and  walk out  pushing your  cart  get everyone  worked up  and then have  them confined  on an airplane  for six hours  that's real smart  it doesn't help  with jet lag  but every time  you try to turn  over to go to  sleep you're like  ow  i can't turn  that way  so you have 
[01:23:00]  to stay up  oh let's see  it's argentinian  scientists  what do they  know  oh  stop  whatever  be by  Pfizer  anyway people  are talking  about that  today and  we got the  train story  is just  classic  yeah this one  i heard it on  the way in  and i had to  confirm it  yeah  it sounded like  one of those  goofy stories  because it's  just so out  there  apparently some  gentleman  in california  was having an  argument with his  girlfriend  and decided to  kill her 
[01:23:30]  that happens  but he had a  novel attempt  that is  i guess right  out of  the oldie  time  1920s movies  oh  to put her  on the train  tracks  are you serious  yeah  not quite tying  her there  though  while he  slowly rolls  his mustache  between thumb  and forefinger  penelope  and as  placards of 
[01:24:00]  text come up  and say  you bitch  that old  school font  and a  powdered  woman  screaming  being tied  to the train  tracks  that's  america's  sweetheart  well she  uh  she was in  the car  he pulls  the car  onto the  train tracks  the gates  were coming  down  he pulled  in front  of the  people  and back  the car  onto the  train tracks  so the  rear of  the car  was facing  the train 
[01:24:30]  then  he opened  the door  bid her a  fond farewell  slammed the  door shut  and made  good his  escape  as he ran  from the  vehicle  the train  doing  doing about  70 miles  per  slams in  to the  back of  the car  well  well  what happened  the car  launched  off the 
[01:25:00]  train tracks  the energy  of the train  going right  through the  car  cars flying  through the  air  woman in  the car  the car  hits the  ground  and lands  where  where  right on  top of the  gentleman that  had left her  on the  tracks  killing him  instantly  it'd be funny  if she was  charged with 
[01:25:30]  murder  the woman  safely strapped  in  is in  stable condition  alive at the  hospital  his last  words  drats  yes  and  scene  no  fin 
[01:26:00]  fin  fin  right  that's what  it's  yeah  that uh  yeah that  story really  just grabbed  me  that's a  great one  there's a lot  of unanswered  questions there  like  it's unanswered  how dumb  is the broad  um  why  well why  didn't she  get out of  the car  as the  train is  about to  uh  i don't know  it might have  been it seems  like if the  car slammed  into him  it probably  happened really  quickly  uh there were  stopped cars  already so he  pulled on the  tracks probably 
[01:26:30]  pulled on the  tracks and got  right out of  the car  and immediately  after that the  car was hit  she's probably  like what are  you doing  yeah what  are you  and and he  was close  enough where  the car just  flew and and  ran him over  and killed him  and killed him  and she is  like okay  uh in the  hospital though  but she's  alive  that is pretty  classic  boy that is a  classic turn of  events  did we uh  cover these uh  what happened 
[01:27:00]  jimmy  the nursing  home  oh  what happened  with the  these nursing  homes are  just a  bevy of  of old  people and  what seems  to be perverts  uh murderers  and a few  people that  want to help  but for the  most part  oh  just gruesome  what happened  at this  particular  nursing home  well it's in  iowa  cops investigate  nude photos  of nursing  home residents  oh my  oh my  so the story 
[01:27:30]  takes a sexy  turn  well it said  that the  the elderly  residents at  greenwood manor  i'm at  greenwood manor  they don't know  doing the  slipper shuffle  i love saying  the slipper  shuffle  shuffle  just shuffling  to the rec room  that could be a  good board name  to take your  nude pictures  slipper shuffle  well they weren't  sexually explicit  they were just  naked old  people  yeah they  didn't uh  make them do  like uh  pornography with 
[01:28:00]  each other or  anything but  why aren't they  posed  that's what he  says but they  probably didn't  know what they  were doing  they probably  put your head  back for  medicine and  just do what  he did what  you do when  your friend falls  asleep in the  chair with his  mouth open  so some dude  at the place  was taking  pictures of  the  they don't  know who  yeah they  don't know  so how  did the  i missed  something i  wasn't paying  attention  how did the  photos uh  well a woman  reported receiving  photos uh 
[01:28:30]  appearing to show  them naked  some woman just  got them i  think mailed to  her and she  identified one of  the photos as  her sister  oh that's gonna  be bad  yeah a family  member i don't  know what  happened there's  really not much  to the story  except the fact  that somebody's  been photographing  old people naked  old people naked  do you think  it's just some  like one of  the people that  work there some  guy obviously  women don't do  this kind of uh  uh crime this  is definitely a  dopey guy thing  as as like a  goof as like a 
[01:29:00]  goof for his  friends maybe like  it could be  something as bad  as some like  maniac who's  two seconds away  from taking a  pillow and  smothering these  old people to  just some guy  going you know  i'm gonna snap a  few pictures and  throw them to my  friends as a  goof hey look at  this one hot  and then uh but  how they got  mailed to the uh  woman's sister is  a little a little  weird she received  photos they don't  say how we're gonna  need an update on  that story yeah  we're still 
[01:29:30]  investigating still  investigating yeah  they don't even  know who did it  yet they're gonna  take that story to  the lab and see  what else we can  get out of it  hey uh we got  uh pat from  minaki here yet  pat's supposed to  be here all right  we're gonna talk  to pat from minaki  also haven't talked  to him in a long  time also on the  way uh reagan's  diaries are out  yes i want copies  of these it shows  reagan uh just  being kind of a  regular guy being  his regular guy  kind of thing he  kept very detailed  diaries on a daily  basis and uh it's

[01:42:30]  much you owe and as i got pulled over  by a city sheriff they were hooking it  up as i'm talking to him going uh you  guys listen opium anthony uh oh you  played that didn't work very well did  yeah i'm pat from monarchy i call big  camera you don't get the cops number  just in panic  trying everything and evidently when they  scan your plate you're already in the  system and it's too late at that point  oh boy yeah that's what they tell you so  i'm like waving goodbye to my van as i'm 
[01:43:00]  standing on ninth ave that's nice i'm  i'm drinking beer with cops as i'm doing  a hundred and sixty in a lamborghini  officer take it easy this poor bastard's  getting his van taken away how much did  you owe in tickets uh like thirty six  hundred dollars with the fines and  everything where did you park on a child  it was registered my brother's old company  that doesn't even exist so nothing's  coming back to me so but they took the  van yeah and it's the only scenario that 
[01:43:30]  could cause a problem yeah and it did and  the uh the van obviously isn't even worth  that much yeah so you wouldn't pay that to  take it out that is now it's gonna go to  what public auction uh yes so how'd you get  here today well i got a uh uh i went from  a scooter yeah raise it no uh i went from  a 95 ford van with 420,000 miles on it  that's the one that got taken away now i  have an 89 chevy van with uh 109,000 which 
[01:44:00]  it's relatively just broken in it's brand  new to pat's okay this is a brand new van  in pat's world yeah the last one had over  400,000 miles on it yeah oh wow well you  do a lot of driving too so i'm in and out  of city yeah and any uh any problems with  it or it looks like it's gonna be okay  nothing ticking or get me through the  summer yeah get me to the virus shows  we could we ought to have a little  charity event for pat yeah we gotta do  something for pat yeah we need to find 
[01:44:30]  you a girl we were responsible for  caving in the roof and breaking the  windshield of his last van remember  that yeah well yeah i duck while i'm  driving it does maybe we can get a girl  to go out with you or something pat on  back to how is the love life how is the  love life you're just not paying attention  those things on hold you don't have to  lose weight yeah you could do both the  same time it seems like a girl is kind  of incentive for you like you were doing  well when you're in the company of a  woman because unfortunately it doesn't  seem like you want to do this for  yourself 
[01:45:00]  yeah other people not worth it which  yeah see is it the most people say they  finally get to a point in their life  and they go i'm doing this for me yeah  and then that's when they succeed when  you do it for other people you don't  really succeed so you know yeah i have a  hard time visualizing my goals i have to  have them right in front of me yeah a  woman  yeah that's what i want yeah so i'm  thinking maybe you might do better you  know doing away with the whole thing  that actually works and what people  really do for themselves and do it for  a superficial things like sex and money 
[01:45:30]  maybe  whatever yeah did you uh get depressed  when she left was there a heartbroken  period in pat from monarchy's life  well you were really into her let's i  mean i hope the new audience  understands pat was in love he he bragged  to us he's like oh i got a girlfriend i  want you guys to meet my girlfriend he  was heartbroken thank god the  cholesterol stuck it back together  again  oh yeah i'm taking that uh diabetes  drug that they just warned about heart  attacks with oh really on debate yeah  jesus oops maybe i'll find a new drug

[02:06:00]  every day  oh yeah  thank you  so pat you  will let me  know when  those lambs  stop broiling  so when was  the last time  you got you  know  uh oh  when you got  everything  let's just call  it everything  everything  uh the uh  be honest  well i gotta  think  it was like a  bachelor party  back in the  90s  wow  really  yeah 
[02:06:30]  with what  the dancer  a donkey  uh  no  like afterwards  some  that'd be a  stripper  before i raised  my standards  yeah  and uh  and that was  the last time  that was what  late 90s  mid 90s  listening to that  new band  pearl jam  right  maybe early  90s  early 90s  wow  wow  so  so what do  you do to  take care of  things  well  uh  eat  no  you know  eat 
[02:07:00]  like  the usual  like when it's  time to take care  of things  daily prostate  maintenance  how often  would you say  that you have to  for yourself  would you say  once every day  once every other day  uh yeah  something like  once every other day  I mean hooker  what  what about hookers  yeah I can't  like uh  convince myself  that uh  I'm not ruining  somebody's life  ruining somebody  else's life  their lives are  ruined already  believe me 
[02:07:30]  what are you talking  about  like a hooker's  gonna come in  and say  no I don't  want to have  sex with you  I feel like I'm  contributing to that  big deal  I mean I did  once  a long time ago  like when I was  17  the second I  was able to  the first time I  drove into the city  why did you  hold up  why did you  hold up your arm  like you were  looking at a watch  that you don't  have on your arm  when you said  I was about  17  right  that's an odd  thing to do  he used to have  a watch  he took it  here's the thing  uh  what's wrong  with that 
[02:08:00]  cause here's the  thing  I always tell  this when I was  at hookers  like you do  know you're  contributing to  someone's downfall  but it feels good  yeah  and also you know  that you're a nice  guy you're not  gonna be abusive  to a girl  if she comes over  so you're paying  her for sex  yeah  you're not gonna  you're gonna treat  her nice  girls used to  like I would  always treat  them like dates  I would never  be rude or  awful to hookers  so what  you're sleeping  with a big deal  it's a service  yeah  oh well let's  hear the story  so you're 17  you drive in the  city and where  did you find  the hooker  uh  you went old  school  went time  square on us  oh yeah  uh 
[02:08:30]  no not time  square  down uh  downtown  christie street  I believe it  was  and it was  uh  hi daddy  yeah that sounds  like it might be  uh  a little too  close for comfort  like in the 80s  uh  uh  8080  so what  was it a street  walker  yeah  pretty scary  back then  wait let's get  let's get  wait so you  so you slowly  uh started uh  driving by  stopped the car  what  yeah  and what'd you say  what was the  conversation  uh  walk us through  this 
[02:09:00]  gee  uh  hi  want  want a  party  oh yeah  i like  parties  sorry the  van back  then uh  too  and i had a  couch that  somebody had  to help  me  with  uh  yeah  so she said  you want to  party  you said  i like  parties  and she  got into  the van  and then  and then  what  where'd you  go  forty dollars  later uh  i had a smile  on my face  and i was  driving back  to jersey  where'd you guys  go though  under a bridge 
[02:09:30]  where'd you  park  like  like  down around  the corner  it was  rather dark  didn't matter  it was a wild  west back then  huh  it was rather  dark  like her  oh my god  she's a  black girl  uh  yeah  cool  alright  for now  and now  and alright  let's uh  let's say hi  to lindsey in  boston  lindsey what's up  that's great  i just wanted to  say that um  maybe he can't  get a date  because he  kind of  sounds like  the father  from family  guy  uh  peter griffin 
[02:10:00]  i think it  i think it  kind of  be a turn off  because it's  kind of funny  to hear  a little bit  and that's  coming from  the boston  uh  girl  that has  the accent  yeah  so uh  there you  go pat  she says  i hope you have  a myocardio  infarction  let's go to  adrian  adrian  jersey  what's up  hey  how are you  doing  good  i want to  say to pat  that i think  maybe some  therapy  might help  him first  oh  a little  therapy  pat 
[02:10:30]  ever  consider  maybe  therapy  well he  knows he  has a father  that he  has never  really seen  oh here's  another part of  the pat  story we forgot  about  that is correct  you've never  you've never  you've never seen  him  never  not even a  picture  and you  and you  googled him  or whatever  map  quested him  and you know  exactly where he  lives and he  lives kind of  close to you  and you slowly  drive by  sometimes  very close  to him  why have you  never seen  him miles  my mother and  my sister had  told me that  he didn't like  taking pictures  i don't know  that is the 
[02:11:00]  worst lie i've  ever heard  yeah  so when did  he leave  uh probably  shortly after i  was born  really  yeah  so you kind  of feel a  little responsible  for that  no  wait why did  he leave  shortly after  you were born  i don't know  you were unplanned  you're thinking  uh i don't  know  maybe  well now that  you bring it  up  it's not my  fault  wait so you  never had a  relationship with  your dad 
[02:11:30]  how could you  not want to  drive by and  see his face  uh  well if you  didn't want to  see me  i don't want to  see him  well it's not  about him  what he wants  it's about you  and your own  curiosity so you  see where you  came from  this is funny  and awful at the  same time  oh it's tragic  yeah  a little bit  why don't you  go by and look  at his face  you don't have  to talk to him  just look at  his face  i don't feel  kind of stalkery  that's why  just looking  just knock on  the door and  go  have a thought  you want to  go play catch 
[02:12:00]  a punch in  the face  let's make  up for lost  time  just remember  pat  you are never  to blame  you're never  to blame  pat  that's right  i feel better  now  yeah  is he alive  as far as i  know  well  ladies and  gentlemen  our staff  around here  is just  terrific  here's some  of the things  that have  happened since  pat got  you know what  everything  can you say  oh so this is  since he had  sex  thank you  um well oj  simpson was  acquitted of  murder
