<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about tornadoes, fueled by recent news coverage and the proliferation of online tornado videos.  The hosts speculated on the unpredictable nature of tornadoes, likening them to monsters, and discussed the geographic concentration of tornadoes in Tornado Alley, debating the reasons for its unique susceptibility. A caller, David from Texas, shared his personal experiences with tornadoes.  This segment also included a tangent on the blues musician Buddy Guy and the hosts' differing musical tastes, and another tangent featuring a humorous discussion about a photo of their former boss, Elo, holding Oprah Winfrey's dog.  Jim Norton arrived in the studio from Los Angeles, recounting a foggy flight and joking about Opie and Anthony’s appearance being described as a “royal wedding” during his recent Jay Leno appearance.  The conversation returned to tornadoes,  with further speculation on their destructive power and the tendency of people to rebuild in affected areas. A caller corrected the hosts' misconception that a cyclone is a tornado on land – clarifying that it’s a tornado over water. The segment concluded with the hosts playing a Stevie Ray Vaughan song before transitioning to another part of the show.

The next segment focused heavily on their former boss, Eric Logan, with the hosts and producer Kenny making numerous jokes and derogatory comments about Logan's significant physical transformation since leaving XM radio, speculating about weight loss, sobriety, and cosmetic surgery. This was followed by a lengthy and highly offensive segment dedicated to playing clips from a Peter Popoff infomercial, with the hosts expressing extreme disgust and disbelief at Popoff's televangelism and alleged scams. The hosts then engaged in salacious and disrespectful commentary about Princess Diana and Prince Charles's relationship,  briefly touched upon Donald Trump's "birther" comments and the race card, Whoopi Goldberg’s opinions, and Kevin Hart’s courtside seat at a basketball game.  The segment concluded with a "Fuck You" segment featuring listener calls filled with offensive language.

The following segment began with a discussion about race and racism, sparked by Whoopi Goldberg’s comments.  The hosts debated the overuse of the "race card," sharing anecdotes about racial incidents, including a Chinese food delivery driver being assaulted and a restaurant owner billing a customer having a seizure.  This transitioned into a phone interview with Brie Olson, one of Charlie Sheen's "goddesses."  The conversation covered her experiences with Sheen, the media’s portrayal of their relationship, her move back to Indiana, and the challenges of intense media scrutiny.  The conversation included explicit discussions of Olson's sex life with Sheen and Jim Norton, featuring sexually suggestive banter and humorous details.  They also briefly touched upon accusations of homophobic language against Atlanta Braves coach Roger McDowell.

A subsequent segment continued the Brie Olson interview, focusing on her recent DUI arrest and her claims of a head injury following a fall on ice.  The conversation touched on her career and book, *The Pet House*, and her relationship with Charlie Sheen, although many details remained vague. This was followed by a studio visit from comedian Nick DiPaolo promoting his Showtime special, "Raw Nerve."  They discussed DiPaolo's comedy and experiences at The Comedy Cellar, and revisited the Roger McDowell incident, further discussing increasing sensitivity and political correctness with many offensive jokes and comments.

The final segment with Nick DiPaolo began with a story about a negative experience with Gloria Allred and a discussion of his film project at Foxwoods.  A large portion of the segment was dominated by a highly graphic and vulgar discussion about bowel movements, featuring detailed descriptions and jokes.  Other tangents included a racially insensitive DNA test joke about Sam Roberts, joking about the Mayan prophecy of the world ending, and DiPaolo's experiences filming for a gay-themed television channel, with jokes about gay behavior. The segment concluded with a tone of irreverence and vulgarity, mirroring the overall style of the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get crazy, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, you're 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fucker.  Have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Enjoy this, yeah.  We should talk about tornadoes.  A lot of tornadoes out there.  Yes.  We're getting some severe weather here, but nothing like they've got.  I don't know.  I saw some green on the map with a little orange, a little yellow.  And then it's a tornado watch. 
[00:01:30]  Tornadoes.  Where are we going to have some tornadoes today?  Well, the Midwest and the South, oh boy, if they had some tornadoes.  Tornadoes.  They sure have their share of tornadoes.  A lot of people, the house is just gone.  Yeah.  Just like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's crazy.  Did you see all the videos?  Yeah.  For some reason.  From the airport, looked cool.  For some reason, they got a lot of videos of the tornadoes this time around, man. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, what is it?  I think they got a lot of these storm chasers out these days.  Yeah.  You know?  I think if you live in an area that gets a lot of tornadoes.  Yeah.  Tornado.  You're not as scared because I think you know what they do, sort of.  Yeah.  I know they're unpredictable to a point.  Yeah, they are.  But I saw a video where a guy couldn't have been more than a mile away, and he was just  hanging out.  I think he was in his apartment three stories up, just checking out a tornado, ripping  through.  And I'm thinking to myself, wow, he's confident enough that this thing isn't going to make 
[00:02:30]  a left turn and come right at him.  Was it one of those, like, Category Fives?  Yes, it was.  Finger of God.  Yes, it was.  Finger of God.  So, I don't know.  Yeah.  Tornadoes scare the hell out of me, though.  Well.  Have you been close to one of these things?  Never.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I don't know.  Every once in a while, you look at the clouds and go, that certainly could be a tornado.  But not like where it happens down there in those states, you know, on the Tornado Alley,  as they call it.  Tornado Alley. 
[00:03:00]  Tornado.  Yeah, I remember driving through there once.  I forgot what state it was, but.  And you saw some shit?  Well, a thunderstorm started, and, I mean, if a tornado was going to form, it was real  close.  I was in some shit there.  Really?  Big hail.  Really?  Pitch blackness.  Really?  Yeah, but no tornado.  But that's, like, the closest I've gotten.  I think that's, like, the only place in the world that gets these types of tornadoes. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  Because it's, like, the perfect storm.  To be honest, it's fun to say, isn't it?  It is the perfect storm.  Yeah.  It's fun to just say tornado.  All right, thank you.  Yeah, so, uh, yeah, I think it's the only place in the world, though.  Like, nowhere else in the world gets, you'll get the occasional little, you know, dust weevil,  whatever they call them there.  A dust bowl?  A dust weevil.  What's a dust bowl, then?  A dust bowl is, you know, when it's very dusty. 
[00:04:00]  Okay.  Like the dust bowl when the soil went bad during the Grapes of Wrath days.  Yeah, I remember the Grapes of Wrath.  Was that the last time we had a dust bowl?  That was the last dust bowl we had.  They're always saying there's going to be another dust bowl if we don't be careful.  But I don't know.  How the fuck do you sleep if you're in Tornado Alley?  I don't know.  I'm serious.  These things can pop down at any point, any time.  Because it's literally a monster.  Yes.  Just because it's made of wind doesn't make it any less of a monster than if a giant dinosaur 
[00:04:30]  was walking around stomping on neighborhoods, right?  We've got to redefine what a monster is because I think you're right.  People are just, people don't call things monsters because they're familiar with them  and they've been around, so they just go, oh, that's what that is.  But it is literally a monster.  It comes around, you don't know when it's going to show up, and then it just rips your  house apart and kills you and shit, and then goes away.  That to me is a monster.  That's just like a dinosaur.  It's a monster.  Just fucking. 
[00:05:00]  Like we're talking about tornadoes and there's one on the TV.  There's one of the tornado videos.  Wow, look at that.  That's fucked up.  They've been getting giant ones, those like mile wide motherfuckers.  Yeah, that one looks extremely wide.  That's crazy.  And I like to think that a bunch of people right now are laughing at us because in their  day-to-day lives, they've seen the tornadoes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe they haven't been affected officially by one, but they've seen them.  They've seen them.  We've never seen one.  I hear they sound like freight trains.  Really?  That's like the one thing you hear everyone say. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  It, uh, I just heard a sound.  It was like a freight train and, uh, I saw the tornado.  Tornado.  We're kind of like those people that live in Florida and they've never seen snow.  Yeah, yeah.  We've never seen tornadoes.  And when it snows, they like freak out.  Right.  Look at, there's two tornadoes on two different TVs.  I'm telling you, for some reason, they got a lot of video of tornadoes, uh, the last couple  of days.  Yeah.  A lot.  Did you see the one?  I think because they know that it's been like, really, there's been a lot of them lately. 
[00:06:00]  You see the one going over the stadium?  No.  That was pretty cool.  Is that a good one?  I don't know where, to be honest.  Oh, wait.  This might, yeah, that's the one right there.  Thanks, Danny.  Oh, that's, uh, wow.  Look at this massive fucking tornado.  That's crazy.  Going right over, is it the Cotton Bowl or something?  It's a pretty famous place where they have the Cotton Bowl or something.  It goes over it?  Well, I mean, the angle this guy is shooting certainly looks like it.  Yeah, it does.  Maybe it's behind it. 
[00:06:30]  I don't know.  Looks close.  Travis is saying it's, uh, Brian Dennehy Stadium.  Brian Dennehy Stadium?  No, see, that's where Danny's wrong.  He misheard me.  I said it's Bryant Denny Stadium.  Why would he have a stadium named after him?  He's a fine character actor.  But, to name a stadium after him?  Alabama's weird.  Cocoon was good.  It wasn't that good.  It's crazy.  Yeah, no shit.  And then this fucking asshole.  I hope he was in that now.  This is what frustrates me about these fucking guys that make videos.  Why stop right there?  Yeah, I don't understand the stopping of some people's videos. 
[00:07:00]  Like, we all know, if you make a video, you gotta try to make it, uh, short.  Short is way better than long.  Yeah.  We all know that.  But if you see a massive tornado like that, you keep rolling.  You can't stop.  And, you know, put the long form out there.  You can make a short highlight, and then you put the long form out there.  And then I'll decide when to fucking move on from your stupid video.  I'll see.  I'll check out the short one, like a trailer almost.  Right.  And then I'll watch the full length.  Uh, this guy wants to tell us about tornadoes.  Uh, David in Texas. 
[00:07:30]  David.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, having lived in Texas all of my life in the same general area, I've noticed, I think  some of it has to do with topography.  Uh, it seems like that, at least in my area, uh, we get them in the same general area.  There's a lot of little minor tornadoes that you never hear about.  Uh, and, and, you know, a big storm comes, I go outside if it's daylight. 
[00:08:00]  Uh, what is he doing?  What are you doing?  What are you going with this?  Where are you going?  You're like a tornado.  What are you doing?  You just come in, you wreak some havoc with us, and then you're gone.  First of all.  You are a tornado of the show.  Look, we're really good at profiling listeners.  You're a truck driver, obviously, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, I am.  Okay.  See, we're great at profiling.  Because you're bored, you're lonely, you haven't talked or seen another human being in a while. 
[00:08:30]  You just have to.  You got your pals, Opie and Anthony, like, what the hell?  They'll have a conversation with me.  This is a conversation.  Yeah, we're just talking.  We're chit-chatting.  Which I don't mind, but we're doing radio.  Yeah, we're doing a show, so it really has to kind of, you know, be a little different  than just real life talking on the CB.  Right.  And then there's the time.  Yeah.  I think it's topography.  What you got?  We get them here occasionally.  They come up, and usually it'll start raining. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  This is like the conversation he has as he waits for his turn to get his load.  Yeah, yeah.  Online for the scales.  Yeah, he's just kind of hanging around.  I don't have to be in Oklahoma until Tuesday.  Goddamn, my roids are itching like crazy today.  Well, I'm not to that point yet.  All right.  I expect that's coming.  What is your point, though?  Have you ever seen a tornado? 
[00:09:30]  Yes, I have.  And does it scare the fuck out of you?  Yes, it does.  And it's hard to be stopped.  But when they start talking about them, you do pay attention.  Okay.  Of course, if you're asleep at night and it comes up, well, maybe you're dead.  Look, I'm not sitting here downplaying this shit.  But I don't want to see a tornado anytime soon. 
[00:10:00]  No.  I think we almost saw some shit, what, was it late summer, early fall around here?  Yeah, yeah.  Didn't one roll through Brooklyn?  But we just can't get that type of tornado here.  It's like an odd thing that has to do with the Rocky Mountains and then the plains and shit  and the way the weather pattern is set up in the Midwest area.  Yeah, there's a way.  And that's why it really only happens in that part of the country and the world is because  it's a perfect setup for these tornadoes. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  Back to my original point about topography.  Right.  Back to topography.  Well, you were right on with topography.  Yes.  All right, David.  All right, my friend.  Thank you, sir.  Do you ever hear of them getting them in Europe?  No, never.  I was just thinking about that.  Hi.  Here's a question.  So we know about Tornado Alley, right?  Yeah.  Where else do they get tornadoes in the world?  They don't.  That's the only place.  They get these small ones.  Like, we'll get them here. 
[00:11:00]  You can get them anywhere.  But it's not a real, like, cold air fucking falling like crazy and hot air rising tornadoes.  It's those weird vortexes that we get here.  I get it.  You ever see, like, the garbage twirling in a parking lot?  And you're like, well, those could get pretty big and do some damage.  But it's not the same as the Midwestern fucking weather-based tornadoes.  It doesn't happen anywhere else in the world.  Nowhere else in the world.  Nowhere else.  That's it.  Where would number two be?  There's got to be at least a number two, even if it's a drop-off.  I don't think there is. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  I never knew that.  It just has to do with the way the Rocky Mountains are set up and the temperature of that and the way the Great Plains open up and the way the jet stream is.  It's just perfectly made for fucking tornadoes.  No kidding.  Yeah.  I did not know that.  I thought somewhere in the world had a similar situation.  A cyclone is not a tornado.  No.  A cyclone is a Pacific hurricane.  No. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Oh.  What's the name of a tornado that spins the other way?  A Nesmendik?  I don't know.  Maybe they do it in Australia.  Is David still on the line?  I think he is.  Oh, all right.  He's so happy right now.  By the way, we love you truckers.  We know you're out there.  I make a lot of miles to you guys.  Oh, I appreciate it.  Thank you, man.  All right, brother.  Keep her between the ditches.  That's right.  Later. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  There goes David.  I like that guy.  Oh, my God.  Shine the side up, dirty side down.  It's a twister.  It's not a tornado.  She's a twister.  She's a twister.  I think a twister is just a wacky name for a tornado.  I like this thought by Brian and PA.  Brian, let's go, brother.  Good morning, boys.  My favorite part about all this is after they mention the freight train and all the chaos.  What do they say?  We're going to rebuild right here.  Yeah.  Why in the hell do they rebuild? 
[00:13:00]  We're going to rebuild.  Yeah, your family's not that special or important.  They'll come visit you in a safe area.  That's cool.  I think people stick around because they've got family that they don't want to leave.  Well, yeah, but how about in West Virginia when it floods in a holler and they build right in the same damn holler where there's like 10 feet of water that come down every time.  Family's been here for years.  We ain't moving.  We ain't moving.  Yeah, fuck that, man.  I get hit with one of those things.  Yeah.  Well, then again, we got hit with 9-11. 
[00:13:30]  We're still hanging around here.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  It's still the fucking epicenter of what the terrorists want to hit.  And they let out documents that said they wanted to bring down the Brooklyn Bridge also recently.  Oh, good.  Al-Qaeda was like all fucking hip on cutting the cables.  Oh, good.  So we're the same way.  We're hypocrites.  Yeah, we kind of are.  Because that's our tornado.  That's our monster.  We should have fucking moved to the hills.  It doesn't strike as often.  But when it strikes, holy shit.  Yeah.  That just comes out of nowhere, though, and just fucking rips your house apart. 
[00:14:00]  That's like Godzilla.  Just comes out of Tokyo Bay.  He fucks shit up.  Goes back.  And you know what happened?  Your house is gone.  Uh-oh.  Freaking out.  You might have given the wrong info today.  What happened?  Let's go to Dave in Iowa.  Dave.  Hi, Dave.  Yeah, hi, guys.  Hey, Ian.  I hate to burst your bubble here, but a cyclone is a tornado over water.  What you're referencing as being a Pacific hurricane is called a typhoon. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, typhoon.  Ah, fuck.  You're right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  My mistake.  You're right.  Hi, guys.  What's your name?  Cyclone.  So a cyclone is a tornado, sort of?  And a roller coaster.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  Typhoon.  Shit.  All right.  It happens.  It happens to the best of them.  I have a fucking bad information.  I had a microphone in front of me and everything.  This guy.  I thought I was right.  This guy thinks it's logical to say, yeah, we'll rebuild right here.  Why is that logical, Bob? 
[00:15:00]  Well, where else are you going to move?  A tornado doesn't come along that often.  And then you want all those hicks to move up there to New York City where there's no tornadoes?  Well, this is the beauty.  Bob, I'll tell you, this is the beauty of the media.  You know, and we're guilty of it, too, because we try to point this shit out.  I watch this stuff on TV, and I'm just convinced you guys are fucking dodging tornadoes left and right.  Nighters.  And you're telling me that you don't really see many of these at all.  I travel all around the Midwest.  I've never seen one. 
[00:15:30]  I've seen a funnel cloud in the air, but I've never seen one on the ground.  Wait a minute.  Also, there's Dixie Alley.  You recall this Dixie Alley?  Yeah.  It's down south.  What's that?  And tornadoes stay on the ground longer in the south for whatever reason.  That's why there's more damage.  You're thinking Dixie Alley is worse than Tornado Alley.  What's Dixie Alley?  Well, apparently it's a scary place.  We're too busy fucking doing a radio show.  Yeah, what am I?  Fucking Dixie Alley is just like Bill Paxton. 
[00:16:00]  Who the fuck do you think I am?  What, do you want us to get Dorothy in the fucking air?  We'll get Dorothy and fucking set it up and read all the fucking info that comes off of it.  That's creepy.  Danny's showing this thing where it's pitch black, darkness, and when you see the lightning  strikes, that's the only time you can see the tornadoes.  Wow.  And there's two of them?  Then you don't even know where they are.  They're sisters?  You just see like this fucking, we got sisters. 
[00:16:30]  Fuck that, man.  Scary.  Yeah, this video is pitch dark until the lightning hits, and then you see the tornadoes in the  background.  So then you wouldn't even know where the fuck they are.  No.  It would be like each time it gets a little lighter, you see them coming closer and closer  to you.  Wow.  All right.  Jimmy.  Jim Norton has arrived from L.A.  Jimmy.  We're talking about tornadoes.  Nighters.  Because there's tornadoes all over the place.  We landed, I was looking out the side window, the fog was literally so bad, I looked down  and it was probably 50 feet above the ground.  Isn't that the creepiest thing? 
[00:17:00]  Horrendous, man.  Oh, when you come out of the cloud and you see the ground right there.  There it is, we're landing.  You just assume you're still 30,000 feet in the air.  It's amazing.  Lined up with that runway, though, perfectly, right?  Perfectly.  It's crazy.  I love it.  ILS.  We got JJ in New Hampshire.  JJ.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, JJ.  Hey, about four years ago up in New Hampshire, we got our only significant tornado in about  50 years.  And as I was driving by the, I missed it by about two minutes driving down the road. 
[00:17:30]  And you turn out your left window as you're driving and you could literally, it was about  a 50-yard wide path through the woods.  You could see about 25 miles into Maine.  To steal Danny's reference, it parted like Poindexter's hair from Revenge of the Nerds.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I guess, I don't know.  I guess I do want to see a tornado.  It would be nice to see if you knew you weren't going to, you know.  Yeah, from a distance.  But you don't know where these things are going.  You know, after.  They go this way, they go that way.  After the clip Danny found, I just want to look at tornado videos today. 
[00:18:00]  Tornadors.  I think that's what I'm going to be doing later today.  Mm.  Because it's a hot topic, this 20-year-old.  It is a hot topic, hot topic.  Did you fucking tell Jay Leno we were gay or something?  No, no, no.  He said, well, how's Opie and Anthony doing?  I said, oh, they're at their royal wedding as a couple.  Yeah, well.  I knew I was kidding.  I didn't want to just say good.  One of the writers goes, you should elaborate on that.  You want to just say good.  He goes, mention that they're on the radio with you or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  That's funny.  So I'm like, okay.  And then Jay goes, in rehearsal, he said, how's Opie and Anthony doing? 
[00:18:30]  I'm like, oh, good.  Anthony's pregnant, but it bombs.  But I'm like, now, whenever he asks, I want to say something about you guys.  I was hoping pregnant would get a laugh.  Yeah, yeah, that is a funny one.  Yeah.  My Twitter exploded.  No, no, but it wasn't like that.  It was funny.  Jimmy just called you guys gay on Leno's show.  I just said you were at the royal wedding.  Dumb.  I said you were at the royal wedding, and I just threw it as a couple.  Yeah, as a couple.  I think we got the clip here.  Now, speaking of the royal wedding, the love is certainly in the air in England, 
[00:19:00]  but over here, it's not always easy for us commoners.  We've learned that many of you in the studio audience, you have questions.  You have questions about love.  You have questions about relationships.  That's why he brought in a man who can help you with those problems.  He knows a lot about love because he spends a great deal of time alone at night on his computer.  Comedian Jim Norton.  Jim, come on out here, buddy. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  I guess the dry cleaners look at the pants, huh?  All right.  Good.  How are things on the Opie and Anthony radio show?  All right?  They're good.  They're currently at the royal wedding.  They're at the royal wedding.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there's a couple.  Now, our audience has lots of questions.  It's time for love advice with Jim and Jim.  But he screwed me up when he says I was on the radio show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because I was going to go, oh, this radio show is going great.  But he's like, so how are they on the radio show?  I was like, oh, wedding.  All right, radio show.  What, do you have jeans on or something? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, but they were nice dress jeans.  And he always fucking attacks my outfit.  And I had my suit jacket on.  And it was good.  I mean.  I haven't seen it yet.  I certainly did the art.  Do you know who Buddy Guy is?  I didn't know who he was.  Who?  Buddy Guy.  The Buddy Guy?  The guitarist.  Yes.  I got a photo of him, but everybody was fawning over him.  Apparently, he's like a legend.  I just didn't know who he was.  He's been around forever.  Yeah, it sounds like one of those.  I couldn't name one song.  I couldn't either.  Jonathan was telling me.  But I know the name.  He said, like, if Keith Richards and Mick Jagger were here, that's the guy in the room 
[00:20:30]  they'd really want to talk to.  Really?  And hang out with.  Like, it's one of those 74-year-old blues guys.  Yeah, he's been around forever.  Yeah, everybody seemed to know who he was.  Fuck yeah.  I just don't know what he sings.  Do you know what he sings?  I'm just distracted every TV.  It has tornadoes on it.  I'm telling you, for some reason, they've really got great video this time around.  Tornadoes kill 160 in the South.  Right, just fucking...  That's craziness.  Jimmy, you just arrived, but Anthony made a good point.  Tornadoes are fucking monsters.  They're monsters. 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  Because, like, if anything else...  We define monsters the wrong way, like zombies, and dinosaur, Godzilla.  This is a fucking monster.  It comes out of nowhere.  It completely fucks you up and kills people and destroys your house, and then it's gone.  Right.  It's a fucking legitimate monster, I believe.  All this thing needs is eyes, and then you would go, okay, there's a monster.  If it had, like, a brain or something.  Yeah.  But that's even worse, because this is just so willy-nilly, you don't even know where  it's going or anything.  This is a jellyfish in the air.  Yeah.  Just all willy-nilly. 
[00:21:30]  It's a big, giant jellyfish.  It doesn't know what it's doing.  I'm amazed jellyfish.  I'm amazed jellyfishes can survive.  It's so stupid.  They're see-through.  They want to go over there, but it just takes them all day.  Dumb things.  They can't get their body organized.  And do they even want to go anywhere?  They just kind of move.  You think they just bump into shit and get lucky?  Big, transparent cock head.  A tornado is wind with Down syndrome.  I guess.  It doesn't know its own strength.  It just wants to pet the barn, but instead it rips it apart. 
[00:22:00]  Jimmy called Tornadoes hillbilly movers.  Oh, God.  It's on my old CD.  That's from 2003.  I don't remember that line.  Yeah, it's an old one.  It's a good one.  I know Jimmy's accurate.  I don't remember that one.  Oh, you're never going to guess who's on my plane.  Who?  You're not going to guess.  I know.  Well, you've got to give us a fucking hand.  Hold on.  I got these.  Yes.  That's right.  It was Arthur Chu.  Arthur Chu.  Is this one of those weird fucking... 
[00:22:30]  No, no, no, no.  No, it's a celebrity.  Um...  No.  All right, what are you doing?  I don't have time for this today.  What are you doing?  Chip Chipperson?  Pete Stevens.  What the fuck?  What the fuck is Pete Stevens?  I was laughing at him.  I was just giggling all the way up the hallway.  Pete Stevens.  Thinking about a horrible thing that is.  I don't know how much I wanted to tell you guys that Pete Stevens was on the plane. 
[00:23:00]  And you guess the shit?  Who is he?  It was Pete Stevens.  Exactly.  Who knows?  I so wish you were fucking playing this castle.  That's hilarious.  Oh, I didn't sleep.  Oh, Sweet Home Chicago?  Buddy Guy?  Never heard of it.  Buddy Guy.  Is that Buddy Guy?  Sweet Home Chicago?  Oh, God.  If you're talking Buddy Guy, what would be the fucking song on his tombstone?  I have no idea.  Well, we should fucking throw something out there.  He actually did a pretty good new song called 74 Years Young. 
[00:23:30]  I guess that's his new album.  But it was fucking good.  Jay worked with him when he was 19.  So he has a lot of those guys on that he worked with when he was really young.  There's a Peter Stevens for you.  Oh, Peter Stevens.  No, not Peter.  Pete.  I hate Peter Stevens because he has white eyebrows.  Good old Peter Stevens.  Yeah, nobody likes that.  He looks like almost Rutger Hauer.  Oh, God.  I can give you info on the other countries that get tornaders.  Oh, really?  Ryan in North Carolina.  Ryan.  Morning, boys.  Morning. 
[00:24:00]  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  This fucking royal wedding.  Are we going to fucking get into this a little later, hopefully?  It happened, right?  Tomorrow.  The lead up to this thing.  Why are we giving them attention over there?  We would laugh at this shit in America.  Go ahead, Ryan.  What's up?  Hey, the other two countries that get the most, we got Argentina and Bangladesh.  Oh, yeah.  And it's similar to what Ann said.  It's topography.  Yeah, but they don't get those mile-wide fucking monsters. 
[00:24:30]  No, man.  Those are freaky.  No, that's like.  And that's two areas, when a tornado hits, do you even know it ever hit?  Yeah, right.  I know it's a fucking hack joke, but Bangladesh.  Bangladesh.  That might organize some shit.  Yeah.  They need a good sweeping.  Because thousands of improvements.  Right.  We're going to lose out on t-shirts if they kill out Bangladesh.  What's that?  I didn't hear you.  We're going to lose out on all.  Oh, we heard you. 
[00:25:00]  We haven't gotten one in a while.  I know.  And he basically just dusted off his face and came right back in.  He certainly did.  You want some more Buddy Guy info?  Yeah, I would love some.  All right, Kevin in New York.  Kevin?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Many times, Eric Clapton has said that Buddy Guy to him was what Elvis Presley was to everybody else.  That's what got him playing guitar.  Fat drug addict.  Yeah, exactly.  Shitting on the ball until he dies. 
[00:25:30]  A guy who liked fucking banana and peanut butter sandwiches and made hard duties and stopped his heart.  A guy that almost knew karate.  A guy whose wife liked his karate instructor.  A guy who went a lot.  A guy who wore a cape.  A pedophile.  No, you know what?  Clapton did an album with him.  Jonathan knew a lot about him. 
[00:26:00]  I'm sure.  I'm sure Buddy Guy is playing with just about everyone you can imagine.  This guy is going to give us the ultimate Buddy Guy song.  Are you being too cool for the room or is this the hit, Jim?  The ultimate.  Me?  Jim, Memphis.  Go, Jim.  Yeah, hey, Buddy Guy's a blues legend up there with BBK.  His biggest hit is Sham Vagan Rafer that he performed with the Rolling Stones there in New York City.  Up there in New York City?  Did he get invited on stage? 
[00:26:30]  John said that.  He goes, if the Stones performed, he's one of the few guys that they would invite on stage.  Buddy Guy in the audience, you've got to say, come on up, right?  Keith Richards gave him a vintage.  What if it's Yngwie Malmsteen sitting in the audience?  Yngwie.  Thank you.  Can we hear Champagne and Reefer?  Never heard of it, sir.  We don't have it.  I can get it on YouTube if you want.  On the Blues channel, we don't have it?  We have a Blues channel on this dumb fucking platform and we don't have that song?  Well, it's in Profit and we have this. 
[00:27:00]  What was the name of that song?  Champagne and Reefer.  But maybe this guy is, that's his favorite.  I want to know the ultimate Buddy Guy song.  If it's the one I'm thinking of, it goes boom, boom, boom, boom, champagne and Reefer.  I bet it doesn't.  You want Stevie Ray Vaughan and Buddy Guy doing it?  Stevie Ray Vaughan, I fucking loved growing up.  Couldn't Stand the Weather would be a great song for all the tornadoes. 
[00:27:30]  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something, see you.  Did you get into Stevie Ray Vaughan at all?  No.  I hate this music.  Danny did, awesome.  I hate this fucking music.  He's won six Grammys.  This is one of the best music in my life, baby.  Oh, the guitar work he played last night was fucking fantastic.  Get all down, man.  When you hear a guitar like that, I don't care.  There's nothing wrong with the world, man. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, stop.  Sounds like his fingers are caught in the strings.  Listen to this shit.  Stevie Ray Vaughan's got a statue dedicated to him.  Fuck this.  In Austin, right?  He is good, man.  And this is every fucking blues song ever made.  Let's bring up there, Mr. Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Let's bring up there.  I like dirty blues.  I don't like when they polish it off.  They overproduce the blues, which is the biggest mistake that genre has done. 
[00:28:30]  You don't like the blues?  All right.  8,000 fucking songs.  Why does it make you angry, Mo?  Oh, because everyone loves the blues and they suck.  You grew up with music and you don't like the blues?  I hate it.  I don't like jazz.  Did you guys ever try to play the blues?  No, I've done a couple of blues songs with my brother. 
[00:29:00]  We played them out live.  I hate when they come across the set list.  This guitar is good, though, man.  Which ones did you guys try?  Stevie Ray Vaughan songs, a couple of them.  I don't even remember the names.  But when they come up on this list, I'm like, all right, I'll fucking, you know, warble through this one.  Pride and Joy, maybe.  Texas Fly.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of that shit.  It's the same songs, though.  It's different words.  Sweet Home Chicago, his.  That guitar is fucking great, though. 
[00:29:30]  That's really good.  I don't know, Jimmy.  I really want to know what the number one buddy guy is.  Sweet Home Chicago is not an original buddy guy, son.  He was fucking killing on the guitar last night, though, man.  Mustang Sally?  The fucking band was all trying to get shots with him.  They don't ask anybody for photos.  Yeah.  The fucking, Renee Russo fucking tripped over herself trying to get one.  It was really weird to watch.  Because those guys, I always do it.  Are you name dropping?  Nah.  You kind of are.  You kind of are.  I got a picture with her, and she didn't care about me.  Is she hot still?  She looks, you can see she's a little older, but she looked good, though, man. 
[00:30:00]  Like, she looked fucking sexy on the body.  She's got to be a lot older.  She's like 54, I think.  She hasn't been around in a while, Renee Russo.  But she was all right, right?  Fucking sexy.  I thought so.  I don't need to brag anyway.  After I was in the pharmacy the other day, there's really nothing else that matters.  Oh, what?  What?  I saw that.  What the fuck was that about?  Did you see the picture he got in the pharmacy?  No.  He was just hanging out.  I was there, and he just walked right by me.  And I stopped him, and I said, oh, my God.  I'm like, hi.  I'm like, I'm a lifelong fan.  I'm like, it's someone that you love saying his name in. 
[00:30:30]  You love saying this guy's name.  Adolf Hitler?  No.  I said, I'm a lifelong fan.  I'm like, I just started, because I just watched an interview prior did.  As Stir Crazy was ending.  So I'm like, how was he to direct?  Because he directed Stir Crazy.  And I'm like, how was he to direct?  How difficult was he?  Got it.  And he goes, he said he was hard.  He was tough to work with.  And we talked about comedy for a little bit.  Sorry.  That's fine.  I just distracted you. 
[00:31:00]  I'm sorry.  Who?  Yeah.  Who the fuck was it?  Don't look down.  You love saying his name.  That's a great hint.  I like saying a lot of his name.  And he was, by the way, in all the celebrities I've met, he could have been the nicest one.  Because he just stood there with me in the pharmacy and talked for like five minutes.  And then he was going to...  Was he getting Valtrex, too?  I don't know.  Or Cialis.  Or Cialis.  The bad news is I had my big camera in the car.  I only had my iPhone.  But the picture came out?  It came out great.  But a big camera would have been better for this.  This is probably the most important actor I'll ever get. 
[00:31:30]  Wow.  You don't know still?  No.  I'd say he's the most...  He's not the most famous, but he's the most impressive actor I've ever gotten.  I enjoy when you say his name.  I'll tell you what happened.  I needed NXIVM, honestly.  I forgot my NXIVM, so I called Dr. Steve.  I'm like, could you call an emergency three-day supply of NXIVM?  He called the pharmacy.  Sure you needed NXIVM.  No, honestly.  Sure you did.  I go there, and it's taking too long, and I'm fucking annoyed, and I'm ready to leave.  I'm like, fuck it, because I could always take something else, a substitute. 
[00:32:00]  And when I got to the hotel room, I had my medicine with me anyway, so I actually shouldn't  even have been there to begin with.  Oh, my God.  Oh, black guy?  How do you know?  Yeah.  Okay.  Now I know who it is, because it's the only actor I say like that.  Oh, yeah.  That was the good hint I gave you.  The fine, fine African-American actor, Sidney Poitier.  Wow, look at that.  He was so fucking nice.  Sidney Poitier.  Isn't that cool?  I couldn't believe I was talking. 
[00:32:30]  Everyone on Twitter was annoyed at me because of the way I fucking was just rambling about  it.  That's a good one.  It's a great shot.  I just leaned over.  I used the iPhone.  I held it out and took it.  Oh, you took that picture?  I held the camera out and reversed it and took the picture myself.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how you do that.  I thought you got someone to take the picture.  Wow, that's good.  I would have said to him, and I saw him outside, he'd gotten his Mercedes, and I waved, and  he waved back.  Did he do an Obama thing like I do?  No, I could have.  Were you a little too needy?  No, I mean, I could have actually.  I was thinking of just walking out and grabbing my camera, but I'm like, what if he's with 
[00:33:00]  a bunch of people or somebody who kind of cock blocks it, and I'm like, right here,  I have the moment.  Just take it.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't want to be greedy.  Did I ever tell you this thing I have with celebrities?  What?  In all these years?  No.  It's going to be really embarrassing.  What?  You get boners?  I get boners.  Every time, and you can't take pictures because you got a big boner.  You get boners.  Boner.  I really want to know if other people do this.  When I see someone really-  Threat to kill them?  Yes.  Oh.  When I see someone really famous, I'm convinced they know me, and not because we're in the- 
[00:33:30]  Oh, right, right.  We're not in the public eye.  I thought this way before I started doing radio.  They're so famous, you're like, they have to know me.  That's how crazy people think.  That's why I didn't want to say this.  That's why I didn't want to say this.  That's why I didn't want to say this.  I'm like, hey, I know you.  Yeah, hey.  Jerry?  You know what?  Now, Jerry.  You know what?  That's not that crazy Mark David Chapman.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of people think that way.  See, I was scared to tell you guys this.  Show up at his house. 
[00:34:00]  I was scared to tell you this, but I think-  Get right to work on this.  I think this is something that a lot of people think, but aren't brave enough to say.  Yeah?  You see them.  I remember seeing Letterman for the first time.  I'm like, he's got to know me.  I watch him every night.  I swear, I never thought that.  All right.  Maybe I should have kept that one to myself.  No, someone will back me up.  I felt like people would know me from the business.  I'm not talking about-  Like, from that, I've thought.  Oh, no.  I'm not talking about-  They've been hurt when they didn't.  No.  This goes way back before I did my first fucking radio show. 
[00:34:30]  No.  No, I never thought that.  Wow.  I thought just the opposite, actually.  I've got to say, yeah.  I've never-  You feel like you have some connection because you've watched them so much, or you get their  music, or whatever it would be.  No, I'm surprised when they know me.  Like, if they recognize me for something, I'm actually surprised.  No, you're confusing the two.  No, no, I'm not.  Because you're famous now.  Meaning, like-  I'm talking about, take the non-famous shit.  Yeah, yeah, no, I know.  I mean, but I would- I never have had that feeling like they would, other than maybe from 
[00:35:00]  the business.  But I've never felt that they would.  Yeah, that's a weird feeling.  I felt like I had relationships with them, but never when I met them.  Like, you know, I fantasized about relationships with Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss, like getting to  know them as people.  But when I met them-  Right.  Or saw them in person, I immediately, you know, I didn't have for any moment the illusion  that they would know me.  That they would know you, right.  Yeah.  More importantly, I ain't really just pissed off somebody.  I love this.  I am.  And it's because of the blues.  Why, they're saying that whiteheads like the blues?  Yeah, let's go to Mike. 
[00:35:30]  Mike?  Let's go to Muddy.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  Mike?  I respect all your positions.  Mikey.  Yes, sir.  Okay, Mike.  God damn it, man.  The blues is the root of it all.  I don't care.  The fucking Model T is the root of cars, too.  I don't want one.  I don't want one.  I'm not going to drive around in one of those fucking things. 
[00:36:00]  Things got better.  Yeah, but I don't know why you don't like the blues.  Because it's monotonous.  It's so overrated as a musical style.  I understand it's like the beginnings of rock and roll and everything.  I understand that.  But it's overrated as a music style in and of itself.  It's monotonous.  It's the same shit.  I can't tell one from another when Clapton's doing it or this guy's doing it or fucking BB's doing it. 
[00:36:30]  It's the same plodding fucking chords over and over again with the same dumb ending to every dumb fucking blues song.  I hate it.  All right.  How many times?  That's how every blue song.  They really do.  You're just in a bubble, brother. 
[00:37:00]  It's a lot of stories, man.  You've got to give it a chance.  You've got to listen to it.  Gives a shit.  I understand.  Oh, times were tough.  Times are really tough.  All right, boys.  Not even Buddy Waters?  Ant is such a jerk.  He really is a jerk.  He really is.  He's funny, though.  He's a jerk.  Ant has his things he likes.  He's just a meanie. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, and I don't like something.  I don't like it.  And blues, I don't like blues.  That's not up for discussion today.  I don't like blues.  And as much as I don't like blues, I don't like jazz.  Nah.  Jazz is hipster blues.  Those are all fucking.  I listen to blues.  Sometimes they go to the restaurant.  I mean, jazz.  And jazz is playing.  And it's like, get the fuck out of here.  They're all playing something different.  Jazz is a little rough.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[00:38:00]  Fi-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti.  The fucking drummer isn't even paying attention to what the bass player's doing.  The guitarist is off on a tear.  And the horn player's just fucking alone.  You want to hear some Miles Davis?  I hate Miles Davis.  Miles Davis?  That fucking guy's got skin like copper.  I'm a buddy guy.  Miles-  He's dead.  Miles Davis.  No, Miles Davis is dead.  Buddy Guy's still alive.  One of the greatest albums ever, they say.  What?  That kind of blue, whatever it's called.  Which is brew?  Nah, man.  Miles Davis.  Yeah, listen to this shit. 
[00:38:30]  Listen to this shit.  You're saying that about Miles Davis?  What's wrong with you?  It doesn't move me, but I recognize it's good.  It's weird.  It's good music.  It just doesn't reach me.  No.  I could never listen to this.  What is wrong?  I'm jamming with him. 
[00:39:00]  Are you actually playing along with Miles Davis?  I was totally doing with Miles Davis.  What's wrong with you?  It's my new album, Totally Doing with Miles Davis.  I would actually buy that. 
[00:39:30]  That's a little rough.  Was he?  I enjoy that.  Live jazz is a little rough.  Oh, God.  Was he a horn player, Miles?  What do you think?  Yeah, he was a...  That's what he did like that.  I don't know what his instrument officially is.  Is it a trumpet?  Is it a cornet?  Is it a fucking whatever it is?  I call it a trumpet.  It's a bugle.  There's an asshole, and I haven't filmed him yet.  Yeah.  He fucking...  He walks down Broadway with the biggest fucking...  What's the biggest fucking retard instrument that you see in an orchestra? 
[00:40:00]  The iracophone.  What is that big...  It's a cello.  You're talking about a cello?  Is it a cello that's the biggest one?  Yeah, it's like a fucking violin 50 times the size.  And the case has a wheel on it, and they wheel it.  Right.  Like, you know, we all grew up, and I think most of us tried an instrument.  Yeah.  And you never went...  Like, they wanted me to play the French horn or whatever.  Yeah.  And I saw the case, the French horn came in.  I'm like, I'm not walking around school with that.  That's crazy. 
[00:40:30]  I look like a fucking queer.  Do they want you to grow up and be a radio agent?  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  And then fast forward, like, yeah, our agent happened to be one of the...  Is he good?  He loves his French horn.  He fucking was part of the...  Where was he?  In Israel.  Oh, really?  He was part of the orchestra or something.  The Mossad?  He was part of the Mossad.  I'd like to hear Bob playing the French horn, and I'd like to hit a fucking 200-mile-an-hour  line drive right into it and knock into his teeth.  The most boring day I ever spent was watching him play the French horn. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, God.  I can officially say it could be the most boring day of my life.  Where was he?  In his garage?  That sounds like a nightmare.  I was...  What a crud.  When we were off the air, and I was just wandering around, I ended up in L.A. for a while.  I actually lived there for a little bit, and I lived in his house upstairs for a bit.  I needed a fucking...  I needed just to be somewhere else, right?  And he's like, hey, you know, tonight is rehearsal for our big concert.  So we went to the local high school, and I sat there for an hour as he's playing the 
[00:41:30]  French horn with a bunch of other people.  It was literally the most boring day of my life.  I have nothing else to add to what I just said, because it was so boring.  I don't even know what else I could say about it.  What is the French horn sound like?  I guess he sounds good.  I don't know a bad one from a good one.  I don't either.  Well, you talk about different things.  But, so what did you say, the cello?  So this fucking idiot, he... 
[00:42:00]  I see him a lot, because I guess...  I'm sort of near Lincoln Center, so I guess he performs there or something, and he's a  younger guy, and he's got that big, huge case.  It's on a wheel.  He's got to wheel his instrument to wherever he's performing.  I'm like, I want to tell the guy, like, you look like a fucking idiot.  He's playing at Lincoln Center.  Yeah, what a dick.  Who cares?  Yeah, but do you ever hear of Apocalyptica, though?  Apocalyptica.  No, what's that?  Oh, is that the Metallica thing?  Well, they do a lot more than that.  I think they have the originals now, but they're getting kind of big.  But if you've never heard of them, it's pretty interesting stuff. 
[00:42:30]  They were the ones that performed with Metallica, right?  Yeah, they did Metallica by four cellos.  So what else are they doing?  They have a whole bunch of original stuff now.  No, I haven't heard it myself, but I hear it's really good.  I like the Metallica stuff.  Yeah, they do that and some Pantera, I do believe.  They do a bunch of covers.  But why would you pick the cellos, my turn?  It's good.  If you've got musical abilities, why wouldn't you pick something you could kind of just  carry around casually instead of wheeling it down Broadway?  Yes.  You can't even fit it in a taxi.  You've got to walk it everywhere.  Yeah, it is crazy.  Woody Allen plays his clarinet. 
[00:43:00]  Perfect.  There you go.  A little case, clarinet.  You're good to go.  Yes.  Clarinet.  A few people want to back me up on that weird...  The old licorice stick, as they called it.  Playing the old licorice stick.  Oh, really?  Oh, back in the day.  How do you know that?  1920.  How does he know that?  I just heard that.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's delicious.  What memory is that covering up?  I know.  Make sure that knowledge is in my head.  Taste the licorice stick.  By the way, we don't have to go there, but I'm relieved that a bunch of people are backing 
[00:43:30]  me up on that weird celebrity feeling that you get when someone's uber-famed.  Really?  Yes.  There's a bunch.  Someone's backing you up on that?  There's a bunch.  Yeah, they're calling from prison phones.  Yeah, I think the same way.  Yeah.  My restraining order says...  And I know them.  Hey, can we play Couldn't Stand the Weather into break or a little piece of that?  You don't have to listen, Ant.  I know there's some Stevie Ray Vaughan fans out there.  Oh, God.  I know.  And they'll bring me back.  I'm just going to eat my sandwich. 
[00:44:00]  All right, we'll go to break with a little of this.  You can start it up because I believe there's a nice fucking long intro.  Of course there's a long intro.  Did you hear the story about the girl who had the same name as Kate Middleton?  Oh, it's fascinating.  Really funny.  Were you here for that?  I don't know.  I heard it.  I'm really confused.  Were you here for that?  Because we played the audio from the Today Show.  Are you fucking with us?  I don't know where the audio is from.  I remember hearing it. 
[00:44:30]  I don't know if it was here.  What are you doing?  I don't remember.  Do you want us to replay it?  I don't know if it's the same story.  All right, we'll get the audio and you tell us if it's the same.  What is the point of the story?  There was no point.  What were they saying?  None point.  We'll get into it because it was really strange.  But here's a little Stevie Ray Vaughan.  We won't play the whole thing, but couldn't stand the weather.  We'll be back.  We'll be back. 
[00:45:00]  We'll be back. 
[00:45:30]  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back. 
[00:46:00]  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be right back. 
[00:46:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:47:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, let's go to Lucy in Texas real fast.  Lucy!  Yeah? 
[00:48:00]  Is your last name Lucy?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Guys, I love you and I love the show.  Well, thank you, Miss McGillicuddy.  I came across something on the internet.  Oh, we'll clean it off immediately.  There's a clip on MSN where Jennifer Hudson arrived two hours late to a taping like the Oprah show and how dare she defy the Oprah.  And they show Eric Logan sitting on Oprah's chair holding her dog like a baby and burping it. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Does that, I wonder if that is included in his job duties or he has to babysit Oprah's dog.  Well, if Elo was talking to us these days, I would certainly ask him that.  Yesterday on my Twitter, Sarah from Buffalo actually screen capped our old boss, Elo.  Bless you, Anthony.  I think I'm getting a cold. 
[00:49:00]  Cold or allergies?  It might be allergies, but I don't usually succumb to allergies.  That fucking pollen is everywhere, man.  In here?  Whatever it is.  It's taking out the strong, this fucking pollen.  Yeah, but not inside.  Like, I'm usually pretty good.  I don't get allergies to a lot of stuff.  If I'm outside and the wind's blowing and you see fucking that green shit all over your cars and everything, then I might have some sniffles.  So then you might have a change of season cold happening.  I might.  It goes from 80 to 50 back to 78 back to 40. 
[00:49:30]  What the fuck?  Your body's like enough already.  This is bullshit.  Can I say there's nothing worse than somebody who thinks they don't get sick?  Like, guys, I normally don't, but this time, I always say that, too, when I'm sick every two weeks.  No, I'm getting cold.  He's been sneezing all morning.  So yesterday on the Twitter, Sarah from Buffalo screen capped this, guys.  Who is that bitch?  Actually, I'll show you the picture.  It's our old boss, Elo.  He's sitting down in his office, and he's got Oprah's. 
[00:50:00]  Let's see.  What do I do?  Are we Apple TV-ing?  Well, I wanted to show you how to use it, but I guess I can't see it on the Twitter app.  Oh, well.  All right.  We'll have to set my iPad up so I can't see it.  There we go.  We got it.  Oh, we got it.  There you go.  There it's on the big screen.  Oh, my God.  He looks gay.  A lot of people said that.  Holy.  I can't believe you just said that.  Holy gay.  Because people were kind of saying that, and I didn't want to be the one to say that. 
[00:50:30]  He looks completely like a gay man.  Fucking Lucy, thank you for this.  So there's our old boss.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Everyone is.  I didn't want to be the one, though.  One more thing.  Ew.  Yeah.  Do you think he put on his resume for Oprah's company that he approved the box of Cotspits?  You know, I noticed that this one episode, because I do watch.  It's a behind-the-scenes Oprah show on OWN. 
[00:51:00]  And I noticed this episode, they were in Elo's office a lot.  And, man, I didn't see one Opie and Anthony picture.  No, huh?  And I know his old office.  Certainly, he was proud to fucking have Opie and Anthony pictures up.  He's moved on.  Huh?  Is he still on Pal Talk?  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  He's moved on.  So the picture that I had on my Twitter yesterday, yeah, we're looking at it now.  It's Elo.  A much different looking Elo.  Oh, yeah.  And that's Oprah's Pride and Joy. 
[00:51:30]  Her number one dog.  I guess she has like eight of them, I think.  And that's the number one.  That's Sadie.  And Elo, I guess it's part of his job description.  He's got to, like, hold and pet Sadie while Oprah fucking yells and screams.  He has to spread the peanut butter.  This is the episode, by the way, that he told me to tell you to watch, Jimmy.  And that you would kill him for it.  Wow.  I do talk to him a little bit, but not like the old days.  That's brutal.  But there he is.  There's our old boss.  A lot thinner.  Looks a lot younger.  And Anthony says, looks gay now. 
[00:52:00]  He looks completely gay in that picture.  Now, I don't know if the video watching it may put him in a different light.  But that still pic grabbed off the TV.  That looks very, very gay.  He shows up on on every once in a while.  And I swear to you, Ant, I don't know this guy.  I see this guy and I go, I know that's him.  We worked with him.  But he completely changed everything about him.  Yeah.  He is.  I think it's happiness that you say.  Yeah.  Because you didn't see happiness when he was working at XM. 
[00:52:30]  He leaves XM and his alcoholism gets fixed.  What a shock.  I know.  Yeah, right.  What a shock.  Yes, Kenny.  May I comment?  Oh, please.  I've recently been in communication with Mr. Logan.  Wow.  Because, in case anybody doesn't know, Opie has a Facebook page now.  Uh-huh.  And he's been putting up some really beautiful pictures on his Facebook page.  Yes.  Just old photos, Kenny.  Jesus, you're embarrassing me.  Go ahead, Kenny.  No, and then you put up your Letterman pictures.  And there's a group shot with the very handsome and talented Opie and Anthony with Eric Logan standing in the middle. 
[00:53:00]  Yes.  So, I sent him that picture because, you know, I thought he should have it as a memento.  And he wrote back to me.  A memento.  Yeah.  And he wrote back to me, great shot.  I love it.  And I said, I know.  That's why I sent it to you.  Ah.  And I invited him to the Anti-Social Network show in Chicago.  And he accepted the invitation and is going to attend Wednesday, June 15th. 
[00:53:30]  Thank you.  Excellent plug.  Tied in with the story.  That's amazing.  And he just had what is the perfect radio appearance.  Yeah, what happened?  Don't ruin it.  Your show is in the middle of the week?  It's the opening night of the festival.  Yes, he kicks off the festival.  How are we going to do that?  Are we going to take a few days that week?  No, I'm going to Chicago.  I can take one day.  I mean, we kick off the festival.  No, we're taking a few days.  You just don't fly to Chicago for one day.  No, one day.  We're getting a lot of press from TBS on that night, so. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Nice.  Damn.  Exciting.  Yeah.  All right, maybe we could hang out with Elo.  Yeah.  And I like to eat steak in Chicago.  I don't, of course.  I wish you were right now.  Right to the heart.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's T-A-K-E.  Yeah, of course.  I just hope he doesn't take us to any of his new places he hangs out.  Exactly.  I don't want to go to Ramrods for a sandwich.  And I put that on the Twitter, too.  Believe it or not, the picture on the left, what we're looking at,  is an Elo that is bloated from alcohol. 
[00:54:30]  He's got blotchy red skin and what could only be described as a Down syndrome haircut.  It's absolutely a Down syndrome haircut.  I'm sorry, but that's what it is.  And brain.  And the picture on the right, it looks like he had a facelift.  Yeah, yeah.  He looks, how many years younger on the right, would you guess?  Oh, my God.  Fucking six months younger?  Six, seven months.  And that's the answer you should have had, Jimmy.  Thank you.  He does look like a GQ model, yeah.  Yeah, his skin is back to normal. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  It looks like he might have had a nose job, though.  You think he might have had some work for the Oprah?  Well, his face is down a little in that.  And his eyebrows are a little far off.  Yeah.  His eyebrows look a little, I think he's had some brow work.  Did he get his eyebrows lifted?  I think Oprah made him do a makeover.  I want Elo to defend himself.  He could do it through a Twitter, a personal text.  I don't care.  That's not the guy we know.  You swear to me you didn't get work done to work with Oprah. 
[00:55:30]  Look, he's got like a chiseled chin.  What's going on with this guy?  He just lost weight, exercise, surgery.  And squeezed the alcohol out of his body.  Yeah, that's what happens when you clean up.  I'm fucked up.  Look at him.  Same guy.  Yeah, same guy.  All right, Lucy, thank you.  All righty.  All right.  All right, Lucy.  Lucy was still there.  That was wonderful.  All right, Lucy.  Now go tell Mrs. Trumbull to watch Little Ricky.  We've been working hard, too. 
[00:56:00]  Remember?  In the crow of a mill park, twisted her nipple and milk came out.  Yes, milk came out.  I was watching this morning when the alarm went off.  Yeah.  I was watching this guy.  You ever hear of Peter Popoff?  He's a reverend, a kind of priest guy or whatever the fuck it is.  This guy is the biggest fucking shyster piece of shit.  Really?  That I've ever seen legally shilling on television. 
[00:56:30]  You know how they do all those, you know, they're selling shit, a lot of infomercials in the morning when we wake up in the morning.  The hours that we keep whenever we wake up, the TV full of that shit.  Yeah, just selling shitty products.  This guy, Peter Popoff, he's got the Peter Popoff Ministries.  He was taking people and victimizing them during the worst times of their life. 
[00:57:00]  And here's his gig.  He gets a shitload of black people to send him money and makes their prayers come true.  Like, he's got this pipeline to God.  He sends you this holy water, right?  And then this envelope he sends you.  And I guess what you're supposed to do is send him seed money.  And then you pray over your bills with the magic water, the miracle water, and your bills get paid. 
[00:57:30]  And he's got all these, he's parading out these black people.  What do you mean your bills get paid?  Your bills get paid.  By who?  By God.  They could accept that?  If you call the cable company?  You don't have to, it's paid.  Why would you call them?  What are you talking about?  Exactly.  I was watching this just going, what the fuck is this guy doing?  And then he gets a bunch of black people to give testimonials.  And they're like, I needed money. 
[00:58:00]  And I sent Peter Popoff my seed money.  And I got a check for $21,000.  From who?  Exactly.  They never tell me where the checks come from.  And the next month, I got a check for $8,000.  And he comes back and he goes, praise God.  From who?  I know.  So he should be arrested.  That's what I'm saying.  Listen, this guy is the worst, most despicable guy I've ever seen on an infomercial. 
[00:58:30]  I've never heard of him.  You got a good clip?  Yeah.  Peter Popoff.  If you don't, we could do it in the back office.  No, this should be just, this should be all right.  This is a little of him.  Let's see what he says.  And he heals people too.  You want God to take away the nicotine craving and the emphysema?  Yeah.  How many of you smoke and don't want to smoke?  You want God to deliver you?  A lot of people.  Amen.  Amen.  I just believe that the Lord is going to give you victory right now.  I want to go to the spring water club. 
[00:59:00]  I thought that was going to be my spring club.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, yeah.  So he heals people.  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, that's one of those.  So he's going to cure this lady of emphysema?  Oh, yeah.  God is instead of like figuring out the Japan situation?  Yeah, yeah.  You got to throw him some cash though too.  Is that what Japan's doing wrong?  They're not giving their seed money?  You need seed money that you got to give to Peter Popoff.  And he was doing the old woman on the crutches.  And he goes, now throw him away.  And she throws him away and she's walking and everyone's hooping and a hollering. 
[00:59:30]  We did that.  Yeah, well, he fell down.  It didn't take.  Please tell me one of the greatest things you've ever seen.  Oh, it was.  Right up until the point where the crowd wanted to kill us.  I was a miracle worker that day for three seconds until the crippled fuck fell on his face.  There's times that I wish we had video rolling.  And that's one of the most amazing things we've ever attempted or had in this case.  Do we have that on tape anywhere?  We should play that on the 10 o'clock. 
[01:00:00]  Tape?  Did we broadcast that day?  Oh, wow.  We were doing a gig.  It was an Alice in Chains cover band, I think.  Until like 95, 96?  It was when we were in Boston.  It was Wheelchair Fred.  And everyone wanted to see him.  So we brought him to our live gig.  Sorry for the people that have heard this story before.  And Ant got the bright idea.  Because we saw him in the past.  The setup is he would come into the studio.  And we'd see him kind of pull himself up a little bit.  And was able to kind of balance himself.  He'd lean on something.  So Ant was convinced this guy could fucking stand no doubt. 
[01:00:30]  And how great would it be if he cured him in front of a drunken fucking crowd?  They were losing their fucking minds, these people, when he was slowly getting out of the chair.  And I'm going, you're healed.  You're healed.  And he starts going, I feel like a wog.  And I'm like, come on, get up.  And people are like amazed.  And he got out of the chair.  Ant was playing the preacher thing to the tilt.  And one foot goes forward away from the chair.  And then he goes to do the other foot.  And he loses balance and falls flat on his face on the stage. 
[01:01:00]  You forgot the one part where he thought maybe the microphone for the lead singer would save his name.  Yeah, yeah, he tried to grab for the microphone to balance himself.  And that fell on top of him with this loud thud.  And then beep, feedback.  Major feedback.  Yeah, it was tragic.  I was laughing so fucking hard.  Ant was laughing so fucking hard.  And then the audience was in complete shock to me.  Yeah, you're a fucking asshole.  And then we hear one guy, you're a fucking asshole.  And then I think we gave out free CDs or something that night because they started throwing them. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, we had to throw the animals something.  They started throwing CDs at us.  Fucker.  And we had to actually leave that gig for our own safety.  That was a good one.  And we left wheelchair Fred there.  That was fun.  We were too busy laughing to help him.  So actually listeners were helping him up.  And they just didn't understand us yet.  Anyway, go ahead, Ant.  No, no, at least we weren't charging money.  Right, seed money. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, seed money.  This guy, Peter Popov, just the biggest shyster, take advantage of people that obviously need help  because they are behind on their bills or whatever.  And he's saying that God will give you money.  God will definitely give you money.  This is so ridiculous.  And then he quotes some Deuteronomy shit and says that,  and on such and such a day, debts will be forgiven.  And he goes, it's in the Bible. 
[01:02:30]  It's in the Bible.  Listen to this guy.  Yeah, let's see what he says on this one.  I'm going to pray.  Come a little closer.  Touch my hands as a powerful point of contact.  There's no distance in prayer.  This anointing, this power is going to flow to you right there where you're at.  You're going to feel it.  You're going to sense it.  You're going to feel that bondage break as you open up and receive the anointed word right now in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  I take authority over every infirmity, over every evil force that has come against the children of God. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to say I've had truly many, many blessings since I've used the spring water.  Just in December, I was wearing maternity clothes because my stomach was here.  And the doctor said I had tumors in cysts that had ruptured and I needed surgery.  For a long time, I've been praying for a husband and my financial blessing.  And it just seemed like it was not coming. 
[01:03:30]  See, a lot of us, we just don't want to do it alone.  And I've been on my own since 1987, raising three children.  Of course.  Now, when that spring water came to me.  It's hard to believe she couldn't meet a guy with three kids and tumor belly.  A catch like this.  Wow, what a singles ad.  A woman has three kids and a belly full of tumors.  That are exploding.  Yes.  Exploding tumors.  Do you like the sound of popcorn? 
[01:04:00]  Well, I've got a bunch of them in my stomach.  Is there a singles bar for that type of shit?  It really is fucking horrible.  Wow, you're awful.  You're kind of right, Jimmy.  I paid for a husband.  I prayed for a husband.  A husband?  And my financial.  My financial reward.  Oh.  She's, uh, yeah, this guy's really a fucking prick.  Her tumors popping sound like when you step on a blown up paper bag.  My husband's trying to sleep.  He fucking keeps dreaming.  He's back in the nom.  Come on.  Fucking loud belly.  Stop it.  I'm trying to relax. 
[01:04:30]  I'm trying to watch the ball game.  Oh, shit.  Your lumpy stomach's in front of the TV.  Let's hear a little more of this fine woman here.  Reverend Popow said, your financial blessing is coming, and it's going to be big.  And guess what?  Your husband coming, too.  And not only did he say I would meet this person, he told me when I was going to meet  this person.  He told me April 23rd.  And I was thinking, well, oh, no, we ain't got nobody. 
[01:05:00]  Well, I used to spring water.  Two days later, my stomach was back down.  Look at that.  Look at that.  She was wearing maternity clothes.  It's Poland.  What a fuck.  He should be arrested.  He should absolutely be arrested.  Exploiting the gullible.  Is that one of his?  She dumped it on her box, the magic spring water, and somebody lapped it off. 
[01:05:30]  That's how she met her husband.  Where's the spring water from, man?  The spring water.  It's some magical spring, and then he prays over it for you.  Yeah, and he sends it to you for free.  But he's just fucking filling up water bottles.  Of course.  From his tap.  Yeah, this is a, he sends you the water and this envelope thing for free.  You know, but then the envelope thing, you got to fill it out and then put money in it  and send it back to him. 
[01:06:00]  So it's like send for your free spring water, but you can't use the spring water unless you  send the envelope back.  Why?  Is it just water?  It's just water.  It's just water unless you send the money back?  You need Pop off there to fucking, to do his magic words over it.  And we live in the same world where people believe in this shit.  There are people, yeah.  That's more creepy than that guy, by the way.  He's a scumbag, but people actually know that people are believing this shit.  They're all, but seem to all be black people.  Where's that other one, Danny? 
[01:06:30]  That one that was just up there.  It's called, yeah, bills overdrawn.  People need money.  And the whole thing with, like, health is one thing.  Like, God would be like, all right, maybe you need some help with your health.  But for money, do you think God would fucking give a shit about money?  I do have faith in people, though, because if you know YouTube, there's a lot of red on  that bar.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of red.  A lot of dislikes.  A lot of dislikes.  And just a tiny, tiny, tiny green.  Tiny green, lots of red. 
[01:07:00]  A lot of dislikes.  He got busted several years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  Randall in Mississippi.  Randall, and then we'll play this clip that Ann picked out.  Randall, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's happening?  Hey, man.  Love you guys.  Look, Peter Popoff, I believe he's the guy who got busted years ago by, like, CNN.  People would come up to be healed, and he would, like, act like the Lord was telling him  about their infirmities, and it was actually his wife speaking to him on, like, a little  remote headset thing stuck in his ear.  And so they went to the crusade with a scanner, and they were, like, listening to what was 
[01:07:30]  being said back and forth.  They were, like, making fun of people and stuff.  Oh, shit, really?  That's pretty cool.  This severely handicapped woman, I mean, child, came with her mother and was, you know, hoping  to get prayed for by this guy.  And it was like they totally avoided her, you know, let her go down, and set her in  the back, and there's some really, if you dig these on YouTube, there's some really disturbing  clips of that guy.  Yeah, yeah, well, that was the whole deal.  I was watching this morning when I first woke up, and I was like, how is this guy not in 
[01:08:00]  jail?  Like, I'm amazed he's not in prison.  Yeah.  I gotta hear this one.  All right, thank you, Randall.  Let's, uh, yep.  Have you been settling on not enough?  Have you settled on having pain or disease in your body?  God doesn't want you to settle.  He wants you to receive.  That's why Reverend Peter Popoff wants to send you the Miracle Spring Water absolutely  free.  Because when you receive the Miracle Spring Water and follow the instructions, your life 
[01:08:30]  will supernaturally improve in ways you can hardly imagine.  I believe it.  Oh, you think?  6.5 million settlement.  $138,000 I earned.  It's dead.  Totally clean and wiped for my credit report.  She got the Miracle Spring Water, anointed her throat, went back to the doctor, and the  cancer is gone.

All you need to do to receive the Miracle Spring Water is call the number on your screen,  request it.  It is absolutely free.  I'll tell you how to use it to experience many mighty miracles in your life.  I am amazed.  In the last few days, so many people have come up to me and told me I was healed of cancer.  I was healed when the doctors had given me up. 
[01:10:00]  So many people in our meetings of just the last few days have told me they were delivered  instantaneously from crack cocaine.  One precious woman told me in Atlanta, she said, I anointed the picture of my son who  was addicted to crack cocaine.  God miraculously delivered him.  God is no respecter person.  What he did for these people just in the last few days, weeks, he wants to do for you.  Call right now.  Let me send you the Miracle Spring Water.  It's free.  I want to tell you how to use it so that you can experience God's miracle. 
[01:10:30]  It's free.  And then when he tells you how to use it, it involves sending him money.  We're going back into the powerful Miracle Spring Water.  He's a disgusting individual.  Oh, it's Hartford, Connecticut.  It's a miracle.  Look at all these people.  Amen.  It's not an accident that you came.  God drew you here by his spirit because he's going to do a work in your life.  And I'll tell you, the devil says, oh, your ministry is almost over.  I'll tell you, you're just getting started, sister. 
[01:11:00]  You're going to get up and go.  Glory to God.  I think she's a doctor.  God's going to burn the cancer out of your body.  Even the outfit.  God's going to burn the cancer out of her body, by the way.  Someone watching me right now on television.  What?  You've got lung cancer also.  Oh, good luck, bro.  I'll tell you, this same anointing is flowing here in Hartford, Connecticut.  Whoa.  He just smashes her in the head.  She falls to the floor. 
[01:11:30]  It's an old carniac.  What a fucking ass.  Them renegade cells.  You feel better?  Yes.  No pain.  No pain.  No pain.  No gain.  No pain.  He healed her right there on stage.  She's fine now.  Oh, please.  Beat a cancer face.  Oh, my God.  She's a cancer heavy.  Look at her bouncing up and down like fucking.  Oh, stop.  She's not even good.  She dances like fucking Rewind.  Taylor, Taylor. 
[01:12:00]  Taylor.  Hallelujah.  Sister, what do you think about it?  Can we get some envelopes?  I love it.  That's my question.  Can we send back duty or something?  We should.  Listen, you had pain in your body, too, didn't you?  You had knee replacement surgery.  Have you been in constant pain ever since?  Yes, I have.  Ah, pain.  More pain.  Can I just make the devil mad? 
[01:12:30]  She said, it's all right.  Oh, he throws the cane away.  Woo!  I tell you in the name of Jesus, I rebuke the pain.  Oh, and she walks.  Now, let's try it.  More Jesus from this day forth than her walk pain-free.  There she goes.  She's fine.  What's that shit about?  This guy. 
[01:13:00]  What's that shit about, though?  Is it adrenaline or are those fucking-  No, I think they're shills.  Those guys are in on it?  Yeah, yeah.  So they get old fucking black women that are in on this?  And they probably give them some cash and go, look.  You know.  Do the right thing.  You're here for some money.  God's going to give you money.  And now she's dancing.  So why don't they talk to those people?  Look, she's doing a jig.  She's doing a jig.  She is.  Oh, that's a terrible dance.  She was just crippled.  Oh, she's good. 
[01:13:30]  And now she's dancing.  Someone watching me on television, you have ankle pain.  It bothers you.  It's excruciating.  Jimmy had a foot thing on his foot once.  I do.  I have ankle pain, Reverend.  Mr. Popoff, I have ankle pain.  Help me.  That's you, sister?  Come on up here.  Call me for a little bit.  How long have you been in pain?  My mother's been behaving promiscuously in Panburgers. 
[01:14:00]  She's been let go.  For over five years.  For over five years.  She's suffering.  She's performing all sodomy in the back store.  I'm going to tell you the devil has tormented her long enough.  It's all black.  This white guy is exploiting these black people.  How much pain is going to be driven from your body right now?  Jesus, let this mighty anointing flow through our system.  Is she okay?  Woo!  You are right!  Woo!  No, he actually gave her the other lady's cancer.  That's how he does it. 
[01:14:30]  Woo!  She's whooping.  That pain went back to the pits of hell.  I just don't get this role.  Let this mighty anointing flow through her body.  Imagine if you had to open for this guy.  I thought I'd hate me.  Oh, let these kidneys be made.  Oh, her kidneys.  Look, she's going to piss on the floor and prove her kidneys are healed.  Now here comes the guy with colon cancer and shit all over the floor like Gigi Allen. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, look at her running in a robe.  There she goes.  Too bad God couldn't put a nicer shirt on her.  Oh, he's going to throw the walker away.  No, he's going to beat her with her.  He's going to take you out too much time walking.  He's going to cave her head in with the walker.  Peter Popoff.  What a fucking asshole.  This guy is just the biggest shyster.  And how that was on a station.  Like, how is station even accepted that guy's money for their paid programming?  They took his money.  He's taking all the people's money and then the fucking TV network takes his money. 
[01:15:30]  It shouldn't be.  It's disgusting.  I was just watching and going, this guy is despicable.  He's feeding off of the most desperate people.  Diseased people.  People that don't have any money.  And he's just fucking like.  And you know people are sending for the free miracle water.  So why don't they do an expose on those people that he supposedly healed?  Why doesn't some kind of 2020 thing get rid of those fucking people?  I think because you've never seen one of those.  They probably don't want to give me any kind of legitimacy. 
[01:16:00]  I think exposing these guys is almost so obvious.  Like, the majority of people know what it is.  It's almost like you're exposing somebody that is so obviously full of shit.  Yeah, but what he's doing pretty much is exploiting the retarded.  It really is.  They're fucking retarded.  And he's exploiting them.  Duchess of Cambridge.  There can be a curveball, though.  Sorry.  Oh.  Yes.  Sorry.  Royal wedding.  I thought the pot was down.  Yeah, that's cool.  No, that's about all I have on that.  I just saw it this morning, and I was flabbergasted at this guy. 
[01:16:30]  We've got to get...  That it's actually on TV that they let this guy do this.  We've got to take a deeper look at this guy and get some clips.  Yeah.  No, what I wanted...  That they would change the law for that girl to become queen.  Well, they're going to change it now before the baby is born.  It gets a bit tricky.  Oh, I know.  That's...  What's her name, man?  That if the firstborn was a daughter, then if she had a little brother, the brother would  inherit the throne.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, this is ridiculous.  I just love they're all just giving their expert advice on this whole royal wedding. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, yes.  On the royal wedding.  She's kind of a rod.  And why doesn't Prince William fix his fucking hair?  He went bald.  He's going bald very early.  You don't care.  He's the prince.  He's going to be a king.  He doesn't give a fuck.  Put the crown on.  His father went bald very early.  He's, like, bald.  Yeah.  They don't believe in getting the fucking...  I don't think he's...  Hair plugs like Hank got?  He's past follicles.  He is, right?  He's past follicles.  He went...  If you go too early in life with your hair, if you're, like, bald in your 20s or something 
[01:17:30]  like that...  It's over.  It's over, Johnny.  And then the worst thing you could do is probably get follicles because then the rest  of your hair falls out and you're just left with the follicles.  That looks stupid.  So you got some sparse fucking chemo hair.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  Your hair looks like fucking 100 people at an outdoor concert event.  Yeah.  Looks like Woodstock at 5 in the morning.  Yeah.  This is Monday.  Everyone's taking off.  Right.  A lot of space between people.  Dude, when you're fucking...  When you're going to be king, you don't need... 
[01:18:00]  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, there's a crown going on that anyway.  You're beyond it.  You're going to see that.  I just wear the king's crown all the time.  What do you think of this horse shit?  I think it's horse shit.  I think in England it's huge.  We're talking about twice as crowded as it was even three days ago, so certainly a lot  of anticipation.  The royal wedding is, of course, tomorrow.  Quickly, by the way, we got our hands on the program, the official program of the royal  wedding.  Are you kidding?  And as we had talked about, there are definitely some parts of this that will be in honor  of, or at least in memory of, Princess Diana, the late Princess Diana from the ham of Jerusalem, 
[01:18:30]  which she also had sung at her wedding, that's included here, as well as many other aspects.  It's going to be a joyful celebration, of course, but also a little bit bittersweet,  because thoughts are certainly going to drift to the late Princess.  Many say that Will and Kate's special day is a reflection of his mother, the People's  Princess, and her influence and legacy certainly.  The People's Princess.  William of Wales.  Oh, God.  William of Wales. 
[01:19:00]  Let me hear the way they intro them.  That is big.  Prince William, heir to the throne.  A reflection of his grounded style found in his volunteerism, his military career, and  his choice for a wife.  Technically, testimony to the undying influence of his late mother, says Mary Robertson.  She hired Diana as a nanny when she was 18 and became friends with the future Princess.  Let her try worth 500 books.  To grow up as isolated and out of touch, as members of the royal family usually do. 
[01:19:30]  Diana recognized the importance of teaching herself.  All right.  Her with that AIDS and the landlines.  Diana was, she was so unhappy in the fucking thing, she was just trying to do anything to  get out of it.  Anything.  Picking up AIDS patients, draining them into her mouth.  She had enough.  She's like, I hate this fucking big-eared husband.  Dumb royal family.  These inbreds are bugging me.  He doesn't fuck me right.  Walking through minefields.  Yeah, she's just praying.  She doesn't do that. 
[01:20:00]  You say, well, she's tap dancing.  She just wanted to, all she wanted to do was fuck that guy who, who was that soldier?  You know that fucking, that officer, that James Hewitt?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, he was putting it to her good.  Oh, giving her good fucking-  Prince Harry looks just like that guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they don't want to even acknowledge it.  They don't acknowledge the fact that Harry looks nothing like Prince Charles.  Nothing at all.  Or his brother.  Nope.  And he looks just like that other guy.  He sure does.  The scandal.  Think of the scandal.  Oh, what would the, what would everybody think of, of people here? 
[01:20:30]  Boy, it's fuck.  I bet you a James Hewitt would fucking pull those fucking horse riding tight pants off  her.  Yeah.  And fuck her hat off.  Oh, God.  I bet you he would fuck her hat right off.  Yeah.  She'd probably, he'd fuck her so good against the horse, she'd be pressed against the horse  and her fucking chin strap would be, it would just kind of bobble off stupidly.  And then her fucking David Bowie hairdo would be all messy. 
[01:21:00]  James Hewitt would stick it in her shitter.  You're like that pre-cum, do you?  To whatever he would say.  Ah, shit.  Oh, man.  He'd double, he'd double stuff her.  He'd put his fucking wiener in her butt and he'd put the end of the cricket fucking stick  in her vag.  Give her a double stuffing.  Because, you know, Charles would just a fucking lump of shit.  He was a lousy leg.  I bet you Charles had, like, he would just, he would probably just roll over on top of  her and, like, hope his penis slipped. 
[01:21:30]  Sometimes, half the times he fucked her, his dick was probably just, like, between her  leg against her pussy.  Yeah, yeah.  He didn't know any better.  Just kind of rubbing.  He didn't know.  He was awful.  Look at that shit.  Daniel's got a bunch of pictures up.  There's that.  Prince Harry doesn't look anything like Prince Charles.  Harry in the middle.  And then there's Hewitt, right?  Who's the guy on the right?  Uh, hang on.  Some other guy.  Some other guy that could be his father?  Alleged to have fucked, uh, lady guy.  Oh, she was throwing that pussy all over the fucking world.  Yeah.  She was, uh, quite the, uh, dish over there. 
[01:22:00]  By the way, if she was getting fucked right, she wouldn't have done that.  I bet if she was getting her ass eaten, she wouldn't have.  Oh, could you see Prince Charles eating her ass?  No, with his dumb fucking skirt.  No.  Why aren't we over there doing this coverage?  Instead, it's this.  His wife, a reflection of him wanting to make his mother proud.  I definitely think the way he is to Kate Middleton is making his mother proud because when she raised them as real people, she took them on the streets of London to see the homeless.  Diana was nice. 
[01:22:30]  She had thin lips, but so much.  She's a white lady.  She would have a hot bath and these people wouldn't have a hot bath.  Who gives a shit she showed them the homeless?  She has hair like the aha video.  So the guy in this picture, the guy on the right, this actually dies brother.  Ew.  Uh-huh.  So I guess they're trying to say that.  I mean, it's not that far away from the family.  Uh-huh.  Because that guy, Hewitt, he's on the left there.  Right.  Oh, they're trying to say that.  Okay.  Right, right.  That's a defensive picture.  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  That's whatever.  I like thinking that Lady Di was just spreading them.  Did you guys hear Alton John did this song about Norma Jean, but then he changed it to Lady Di?  No, that was the third time he changed the song.  He did it for Ryan White, too, right?  Did he?  The Ryan White one didn't really take off.  That was the first time he changed the song.  He's changed it too many times.  I know.  Is he going to be singing, you think, of this dumb thing?  He sings forever. 
[01:23:30]  But, you know, now it's, you know, the team that's knocked out of the playoffs fucking  changes the song.  Hey, are the Lakers still in it?  I haven't watched.  Of course they're still in it.  It was all about hockey last night, though.  Travis' Canadians are done.  Oh, yeah.  Seventh game.  Overtime loss.  That's not a record.  I just want to say, really quick, I picked three out of the four series.  Oh, you did?  Individual games, I suck.  You're a curse.  But I picked the Lightning, I picked the Flyers, and I picked the Bruins. 
[01:24:00]  The only one I didn't get right was the Blackhawks.  I just want to put that out there.  Because I get killed with the sports curse.  Individual games, I suck.  Didn't you pick the Islanders like six months ago?  I picked the Islanders.  Oh, well.  No, I didn't pick the Islanders.  Good joke, but I knew that that was a shitty team.  Well.  You were following the basketball, Jimmy?  No.  So why did you ask about Lakers?  I was curious how they're doing.  I mean, because I used to like the Lakers, but I don't know what the fuck about them.  I watched the football. 
[01:24:30]  No, I was thinking of the Lakers last night, because they were showing footage of stupid  Kevin Hart, who had courtside seats, and there was a fucking player almost landed in his lap.  So he was, like, in the shot.  That would have killed him.  He's a small guy.  Yeah, so he's a slighter friend.  Looked like a child in that chair.  He looked like Adam Rich when he was on Eight is Enough, being interviewed by Carson.  He's a short guy.  Yeah.  He's shorter than you, right, Jim?  Yeah, he's a giant cock.  He really annoys me.  You know he has a big piece, huh?  Giant.  It's legendary.  That's going to look silly on a short guy.  I know. 
[01:25:00]  That's the only thing I could feel good about.  His penis looks silly.  Why don't we break?  We've got to get into the Roger McDowell story.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And Bob Schieffer calling Mr. Trump a racist.  That's idiotic.  Not for the racism.  He's not a racist, but he has an absolute ass.  An asshole.  We played, we were live when he was doing this press conference yesterday.  Donald Trump, it was hilarious, the shit he was coming up with.  Oh, just an idiot.  Just a racist.  And Whoopi Goldberg saying she's sick of all the racism and she, yeah, she's pulling out 
[01:25:30]  that damn card.  She's playing the race card and not even trying to cover it up anymore.  Well, we got that next too.  Fuck you.  It's not a racial issue.  They thought they had him.  Everything's racial.  If he was not eligible to run, then he couldn't run for re-election.  It was like, it's like Watergate or it's like fucking the blowjob Clinton got.  It's if they can get you, they get you on anything.  Anytime they see a little light coming through the crack in the door, that's what they do.  This is a dumb issue.  It's not real. 
[01:26:00]  Of course.  Let it go.  Some guy got mad at me on Twitter.  I made fun of Trump.  He's like, you're afraid.  No one on late night makes fun of Obama.  Shut up.  All right.  Fucking asshole.  Trump's just an idiot.  He's a dope.  He's a business man who gives a fuck.  He's a professional wrestler on a microphone.  Enough with him.  It's fun to watch, but you can't take him seriously.  Also, the group that says the world's ending on May 21st, we got a little audio on those  guys too.  Yeah.  And Brie Olsen is finally calling us. 
[01:26:30]  Good, good.  At 8.30.  She's on the cover of the latest issue of Penthouse.  Looking lovely.  Oh, hell yeah.  And Whoopi Goldberg was on Star Trek TNG, not Star Trek TNB.  Yeah, there's a difference.  There is a difference there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little bit?  Some websites have some acronyms and stuff for certain things.  LeVar Burton was on that one too, right?  Yes, LeVar Burton was on that too.  Oh, and WARF.  Yes, and WARF, of course. 
[01:27:00]  Star Trek TNB.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U.L.I.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Hi, I just want to say fuck you to my job for basically firing everybody and ruining  all chances that I had at the life that they promised me.  And for my boss, always coming into work and talking about all this new stuff, the new house,  the new car that she bought.  Fuck you.  I have to sell my house because I can't afford it. 
[01:27:30]  Fuck you.  Yeah, this fuck you is for the state of New Jersey.  Thanks for making me sit in court all fucking day and then double charging me for a stupid  unregistered vehicle ticket.  Fuck you.  And just generally for making it impossible for anybody to fucking make it out over here.  Fuck you, New Jersey.  Fuck you.  Hey, you fat fucking cunt.  In line, when it says 10 items are left, you don't take 40 fucking items, you fat fuck.  Maybe that's why you're going to have a heart attack in the next five years, you fucking 
[01:28:00]  moose.  Fuck you, fat pig.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this one goes out to your moron fucking beacon programmers.  You guys all fucking suck a dick.  I'm tired of hearing this fucking spaggot ass motherfucker chasing Ellis.  Bye bye.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to give a big fuck you to my ex-girlfriend who, uh, her reason for dating  a new guy after like three days is she's so in love with me that she can't be alone. 
[01:28:30]  I'm not sure how that works, but fuck you anyway.  Fuck you.  This F.U. goes out to my girlfriend's parents, who won't let us sleep in the same bed when  we visit, even though we've been dating for three fucking years.  I'm 24 and she is 27.  Fuck you.  Guess what?  When you come over to our place, married people aren't allowed to sit down.  Enjoy standing, fuck shit.  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU.  Line 1.  That's 866-FU. 
[01:29:00]  Line 1.  Series XM.  The virus.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Ant loves Muse.  You like the Muse, right, Ant?  I actually don't mind Muse.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm surprised by that.  I know.  I think you didn't like him at first.  No, sometimes it takes me a while to distinguish some of the stupid shit generic fans from the 
[01:29:30]  rest.  But I think Muse kind of stands out a little bit.  Yeah.  Don't ask me anything about a song or anything like that.  We got the most annoying 30 seconds.  The finalists, Jimmy.  There's some good ones.  We're down to 12, so we're going to need your help today a little later, okay?  Sure.  But we got Brie Olsen calling in, so maybe after Brie's phone call.  She's calling at 830.  830, yeah.  But we got other things to do. 
[01:30:00]  We got Bob Schieffer, or yeah, Schieffer calling Mr. Trump a racist.  And then we got the Whoopi Goldberg clip.  Who's Bob Schieffer?  He's one of those CBS Evening News guys.  A racist.  And then we got Whoopi Goldberg, the clip-in just.  Yeah, Whoopi saying she's going to start playing the race card.  Start.  And we got Gloria Allred involved in the Roger McDowell case, which is a great case.  Was that the one where Roger spit and hit Kramer in the head?  He actually, was that the one? 
[01:30:30]  I don't know that episode.  Is it finally coming to justice?  Will be served?  All right, I'll say yes.  Because Roger McDowell was the one that spit that loogie.  Seinfeld?  Oh, yeah.  Roger McDowell was on Seinfeld?  Classic episode.  But Roger was on it?  Well, he was in this grainy film that was supposed to look like this Bruder film.  But they mentioned him.  Oh, yeah.  And you see him, yeah.  He's actually up there in the bushes spitting out.  Yeah, spitting.  I'm only in part of the time with your Seinfeld.  I'm sorry.  Yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, right there.  I was doing night radio during that whole fucking year.  See there?  Roger McDowell's behind the screen.  Oh, I do remember this clip.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  That was such a great...  Hey, pretty...  What does he say?  Nice game, pretty boy.  Nice game, pretty boy.  Nice game, pretty boy.  Then, a second later, something happened that changed us in a very deep and profound way  from that day forward.  Who was it?  He spit on us. 
[01:31:30]  And I screamed out, I'm hit!  Then, I turned, and the spit ricocheted off him, and it hit me.  Wow.  What a story.  Unfortunately, the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account.  Allow me to reconstruct this, if I may, for Ms. Venice.  The fact that Newman was in JFK, too, makes it even better.  Oh, that's right, yeah.  Wait. 
[01:32:00]  JFK?  Yeah, the movie JFK, yeah.  Yeah, he was.  Wait.  Yeah, and they do a whole recreation of the court scene.  He was one of the...  He was on the crew.  Oh.  On the...  The prosecution team, I guess.  Yeah, that's one magic look.  But they're using Roger McDowell in this episode, so does he have a reputation for being an asshole?  I guess.  It was kind of a jokey thing.  I know, but they used Roger McDowell, of all people. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Maybe there's something to that.  They probably were able to get him that day.  We'll get into that in a second.  But first, Bob Schieffer on Donald Trump.  Schieffer.  Bob Schieffer is our chief Washington correspondent and anchor of Face the Nation.  Bob, this was a pretty remarkable moment today.  Do you think this will put an end to the so-called birther movement?  Sure.  You know, I really think that it will, Katie.  I mean, I think this resolves it once and for all for reasonable people.  There are going to be some people out there that are never going to be satisfied. 
[01:33:00]  But I want to go on to what Donald Trump said after he said this is out and everything.  He said, we need to look at his grades and see if he was a good enough student to get into Harvard Law School.  Well, that's just code for saying he got into law school because he's black.  This is an ugly strain of racism that's running through this whole thing.  It's kind of like when the media says unruly teens for blacks.  Yeah.  Yeah, unruly teens. 
[01:33:30]  How about that?  How about that?  Yeah, that's code for, well, I can't say it, but it is code for that.  Here's the thing.  Trump is an asshole and he's embarrassed that he was proven wrong.  Yeah.  So instead of just saying I was wrong, which this is everything that's wrong with people  in this country, he has to spit it like, well, at least I got him to show it.  It's not I've made an ass out of myself and he's saying that Obama said he didn't have  very good grades.  I want to see his record.  If you're the president, all that stuff should be open.  Yeah.  But I'm pretty sure Obama is probably qualified to be in Harvard. 
[01:34:00]  Did he edit the fucking Harvard Review, which is the law?  Yeah, but he did that because he was black.  It's fucking amazing.  I don't know what his grades were.  I don't know.  But I think blacks are wrong.  It's not racist.  It's not racism.  Akeith explained to me, I was talking to Akeith and somebody else about this, like why, and  Sherrod raised a good point too, because what they're doing is with the whole Bertha  thing is they're saying like, look, you know, he's not from here.  He's not one of us.  And they said, that's got something to do with race. 
[01:34:30]  Like, that's why they're like, look at, you don't hear that from other presidents.  Yeah.  Here they are going, look at, he's from Africa.  He's different.  And, you know, it's a good point.  But the thing is, they just fucking want to use anything they can when they think they can  get you.  That's all this is.  What about the basketball line Donald Trump used yesterday?  I didn't hear, what did douchebag, I used to think he was okay.  I just really can't stand him.  We were having fun listening to him yesterday.  What was it?  I don't know.  Maybe if he didn't spend so much time on the basketball court or something like that. 
[01:35:00]  Gas prices would be down or something, whatever.  But I don't think he's being racist.  I think he's just being an asshole.  Yeah, he's not being, whatever.  Yeah.  As a black president, welcome to politics.  This is what they do to everybody.  I mean.  Yeah.  Look at eight years of George Bush.  He took a being, you saw everybody, everywhere he went there were protests with signs of him  with a Hitler mustache on and, you know, swastikas all around his pictures and Obama's going  through the same thing. 
[01:35:30]  It doesn't make it racist just because he's black.  Stop it.  No, and it's also like, look at how, if they think they have something, they just keep  needling and pushing and no matter what makes them think they have something, they just keep  fucking digging and digging and digging until hopefully they get something.  Yep.  And, you know, I mean, what a great example, even though that was a crime.  Yeah.  But that little bitty, stupid thing ended a presidency.  Yeah.  It's fucking amazing what can start the ball rolling. 
[01:36:00]  And it had nothing to do with Nixon's race, that's for sure.  And it was a crime, but I mean, still.  It was a crime, yeah.  But there have been plenty of presidents that have taken so much shit just based on their  party.  You know, not the fucking their race or anything like that, even though they've all been white  guys, but just because he's black, hey, you're the president, you got to take this shit.  They're going to try to get you anywhere they can.  Everybody was asking, why didn't he do it? 
[01:36:30]  Now, we have to look at it.  We have to see, is it real?  Is it proper?  What's on it?  But I hope it checks out beautifully.  What, your wig?  Mr. Trump, meanwhile, greased through New Hampshire as if...  Yeah, why does he answer questions about his hair finally?  Yeah.  We've all been wondering forever, what is it?  Yeah.  Finally tell us.  Is it real?  Right, is it real?  We have to take a close look at it. 
[01:37:00]  He's just a boardroom douche.  Yeah.  You know?  Okay, a relatively simple...  He's a showman.  He's a carny fucking guy.  That's what Obama called him.  He called him a sideshow and a carny barker, but not by name.  He dismissed him as he should have.  That's what he is.  When, during his press conference yesterday?  Yeah, and he just said, we don't have time.  We don't have time for this silliness.  He loves the attention.  He loves the press.  Any press is good press for him.  And that's how he feels.  But the... 
[01:37:30]  But it doesn't make him a racist.  I hate when the...  There are real racists out there.  They do horrible things.  They...  Down south, there's quite a few organizations that are still...  Did you say there are racists out there?  Yeah.  There are racists.  Out there.  That are...  Out there.  Out there.  Not in here.  Sorry.  I could have my racial opinions that are based on the facts that I see on a daily basis. 
[01:38:00]  That's what I do.  I search out facts and I base my opinions on certain racial facts.  Just that's what I do.  I'm not sitting there prejudging.  I'm not fucking...  I was just going for a dumb joke.  No, no.  I know.  I'm just explaining.  Just a silly dumb joke.  Some people don't quite get it.  They don't quite get it.  You want to do the whoopee clip?  Oh, please.  Because that drove you nuts.  By the way, look at Dan Rather, who ran a story he knew wasn't true for Bush about 
[01:38:30]  his military service or something, whatever it was.  And he just fucking lost his job.  Like, that's how bad they'll go after you sometimes.  Yeah.  That obviously you couldn't cry race.  You can cry political ideology.  Yeah.  And that's all it is with Obama.  It's political ideology.  Because he's black, you can't say it's race.  But they went with something that they knew was bullshit.  Yep.  And Rather, it feels like he was thrown under the bus or whatever.  But fuck him.  It was time for him to go.  But you know what I mean? 
[01:39:00]  It's like, come on.  They do that to get you.  Who's your guy?  Brokaw.  I like the bad perspective.  Brokaw.  I like Brokaw.  Brokaw.  He was the last one I liked.  I saw some early clips of him.  It was some documentary I was watching, and they showed him.  And he was just like, here in San Francisco, we're looking at another debate coming up.  And for him to be able to overcome that dumb impediment he had, I guess he had to be good,  you know?  People trusted him, too.  They had that trustworthy thing. 
[01:39:30]  He was one of the last, I think, that were actually trusted newsmen.  Yep.  But now, I couldn't fucking tell you.  And none of them have any...  None of them have dignity.  They need what is dignity.  None of them have that.  I don't mind.  I just say don't mind is the best I could do.  Brian Williams, I don't mind him.  Yeah, yeah.  He's kind of there.  There's no Tom Brokaw.  But you could tell if the network tells Brian Williams to do something, he's going to fucking do it. 
[01:40:00]  Katie Couric always sucked.  Yeah.  As far as the news goes.  She's out.  I know.  She's out.  She's going to be the new Oprah.  She's out like us.  By the way, the Obamas are on Oprah today.  Yeah, yeah.  And the only reason I bring that up, our fucking boss, once again, our old boss, Elo, was he  hanging out with them?  Yeah, he'll meet them.  As the president of Harpo, he'll get a picture.  Holy shit, that's pretty huge.  He's come a long way, this Elo.  What was he doing at XM?  Nothing.  Oh, my God.  That's the thing he's doing there.  Talking a good game while driving Oprah's company to the ground. 
[01:40:30]  You think they'll play the homeless Charlie clip?  Shut up.  I don't think that's going to happen.  That had something to do with not Obama, though.  No, no.  Okay.  That's everybody else.  Condoleezza.  Condoleezza.  Remember the CEO at the time?  Oh, yeah.  He loved it, didn't he?  Yeah, it was great.  Yeah, he loved it, all right.  I love the disrespect to show that guy by showing up for a meeting an hour late as I'm sitting 
[01:41:00]  there like, oh, I'll be here any minute.  Fuck him.  You didn't even acknowledge that he had any power at XM.  Fuck him.  Nate?  Yeah.  Nate.  Yeah.  I knew we were doomed when Ant finally arrived, which was hilarious.  And he looks at me and goes, I just want to let you guys know that I completely agree  with the Don Imus firing.  I just went, well.  All right.  I have nothing.  Racist.  I actually said, well, I have nothing to say here then.  I wasn't even going to attempt to fucking say shit. 
[01:41:30]  Thanks to your completely racist-based fucking opinion.  That was his opening line to us when it was supposed to be a, because Elo set it up, because  Elo was always our guy, and Elo wanted us to really get to know Nate, because he was  running the company.  Oh, God.  And Elo was trying to tell us he's not that bad of a guy, and you guys just all need to  just sit down and get to know each other a little bit.  And that was his opening line.  And I'm like, well, I have nothing to say there.  You should have convinced him otherwise.  No.  No.  No.  You just knew. 
[01:42:00]  Ant knows.  Yeah.  You just knew.  Look at him.  Look at him.  And not because of you.  There's no way to convince him.  Oh, I see his dumb face.  Guys like that are so easy.  Nope.  Because they're saying something that's out of agenda, and when you hit them with logic,  they have no point to be made.  He was the president of the company.  He was used to saying things, and nobody fucking challenging him.  Jimmy, you know I challenge people.  You could have challenged him with respect.  In that situation, I knew in my fucking soul that the only reason he agreed with that 
[01:42:30]  was because he was black.  That's right.  That's me saying it.  And there was no way to change his mind.  And I was like, that's the only reason he agrees with I am his firing, because it's  a black thing.  And I knew that by looking in his eyes, and I'm like, okay, I know where I'm at.  There's no fucking way of even discussing this.  It still would have been nice, though, to fucking, even if he didn't acknowledge the  point.  And it kills me that I have to say that, but that's what I believe that day.  I didn't even care.  I knew he was fucking on borrowed time anyway at that point.  The greatest feeling is when you talk to someone like that. 
[01:43:00]  And again, you can't yell at him or argue because he's the president of the company.  But the best thing, even if he doesn't give in, when you know that he knows you kicked  his ass in the fucking, in the chat, there's no better feeling than when you walk out of  that office and they know and you know that you've kicked that fucking ass in that conversation.  It was a hell, it was a hellish time for XM.  I just knew it was just way better to shut my mouth and just eat my fucking eggs.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  Seriously.  No way, man.  Can I, since you, since you offered that, can I ask why you feel that way?  Which one?  That's what I would have said to him.  Oh, really?  Sure.  I mean, again, there's a way to do it respectfully or you go, you know, I don't agree and here's  why.  By him saying that, he's obviously up for discussing it.  Maybe he wanted to hear your take on it or maybe he wanted to challenge you on it or  maybe he wanted to dare you to challenge him.  That issue to me, I mean, and how I say it's going to be kind of whatever, but it was so  black and white.  Yeah.  It was so obvious that I just wanted. 
[01:44:00]  I should have been fired and he was fucking just trying to entertain his audience.  I can't see it the other way ever.  Are you saying that because it offended you personally or you don't feel like he did his  job?  Yeah.  No, I understand your questioning.  Sure.  I just didn't feel like getting into it.  And what you do is you, the whole time you're talking, you just massage your cock.  Yeah.  Just fucking rub it.  I'm just massage in my cock.  Squeeze the helmet.  Squeeze the helmet.  Yeah.  Yeah, squeeze that.  I'm annoyed for you guys that you had to hear that.  Oh.  And by the way, I probably, I'm talking big shit now. 
[01:44:30]  No.  No.  But had I been in that room, I might have done this.  We were on our way to bingo.  Shut up.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  Okay, sir.  I want to hear the whoopee thing.  Whoopee shit.  Sure.  Yeah, let's hear what she's up to.  You know, I care about all of it.  I need to set up on this, because I don't know this one at all.  She's black.  Go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's about the race card, but what got her going?  I guess the Obama shit.  With the birth certificate?  That, I think maybe a couple of other issues, but it's been over time. 
[01:45:00]  She's been so pissed off at people about Obama and hasn't, as she said, hasn't played  the race card, which is bullshit.  I've seen clips of her playing the race card at every turn, so now she's like, now I'm  just admitting it that, yeah, I'm going to play it, so fuck it.  Okay.  You know what?  I care about all of it, because I'm getting tired of trying to find reasons not to think  of stuff as being slightly racist. 
[01:45:30]  It is very difficult on a daily basis to see this stuff and not just say, you know, this  is what it is.  But I have been raised to think, okay, well, maybe that's not what they mean.  Maybe let me figure it out.  But I have to say, I'm really, well, I do think again, but you know, being black, when  you say, you know, this is racist, 9,000 people say, oh, no, you're just playing the  race card.  Well, you know what?  I'm playing the damn card now.  Whoopi!  Whoo!  Shut up! 
[01:46:00]  Put your race card away!  Stop it!  The only thing that makes me think, though, and I don't think that, Patrice said a great  thing one time, and believe me, it hurts my fucking chest to say that, but he said, I've  never met a racist.  No one ever fucking owns up to it.  Yeah.  So it is kind of hard to see, because it's not like when you ask somebody about it, they're  like, yes, so we can make informed decisions.  But racism, it's like, you could call anything racism, and that 99% of the shit that's called 
[01:46:30]  racism isn't.  You're right.  It just isn't.  A lot of things that are racist can easily be said, like, no, it's not.  No, I was only doing it for that reason.  Do you know what?  If you can't identify racism, it ain't fucking racism.  That's what I think.  I absolutely think that.  If you can't just...  It's God punishing you.  Hold on.  Yes, it is God punishing me.  With the AIDS.  No, if you can't identify it, then I don't think it's really racist. 
[01:47:00]  But, like, what identifies it?  Like...  What identifies it is real racism.  Racism is something like fucking...  It's like...  It's like fucking rape.  It's like you...  You...  It's a thing.  It's something that happens, and it's terrible.  But don't fucking...  Don't make it...  Don't delude it by calling shit racist that isn't racist.  So when Nate said to you, I agree with it, I'm as firing. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  He didn't say, I'm black, and fuck him, he's white.  Yeah.  But you knew.  I just knew.  You knew.  That's sometimes all you can find with something that's racial.  Well...  You just know.  And you were right.  That was why he said that.  But am I being racist for thinking I just knew because he was black?  That's the way he felt about that?  No, because he sat you down and said, I agree with the I'm as firing.  You didn't fucking...  He just offered that.  But now...  You're right.  You know what?  Technically speaking...  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Maybe he just agreed with it.  No, but you know why. 
[01:48:00]  I know why.  It's almost like when a guy who's legit and is a college student and is being followed  in a store, he knows why he's being followed.  But I didn't make a big stink about him being fucking racist.  You can't defy it.  Sometimes you just know.  Yeah.  You just do.  Well, Whoopi, on the other hand, has a vested interest in things being racist.  She does.  She's gotten annoying with race.  She's black.  She's black.  She is?  So, yeah.  The way she fucking didn't want to talk about it with us, like that to me says she's gotten  a little bullshitty about race. 
[01:48:30]  And she pisses her pants when she laughs.  I've seen those commercials.  She sits there and she fucking giggles and...  She jiggles.  She jiggles and giggles and fucking pisses.  That's a racist laugh.  Yes.  Jiggle.  Like, I like to let black people know that I'm not racist, so I'll meet black people and  I'll put our hands together and I'll go, you know, you're as good as me.  Yes.  And they appreciate that.  And they're like, thanks a lot. 
[01:49:00]  We're all the same color on the inside?  No, I don't say that.  I just say, you know what?  I wouldn't even mind if you moved within five homes of me.  Five's a good buffer.  Five homes.  Five's a good buffer.  I don't know.  You get a few warnings in between.  You know, the great doctor, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. did say, you know, to judge  people on the content of their character and not the color of their skin.  Exactly. 
[01:49:30]  I don't like Anthony quoting Martin Luther King.  And that is absolutely what I agree with.  I agree with Dr. Martin Luther King.  Hamburger.  Yeah.  Give yourself a hamburger.  Hamburger.  Shuggy-ducky.  I agree.  Nice.  But the second you judge a black person or even a group of black people on the content  of their character, people will say you're judging them on the color of their skin. 
[01:50:00]  No.  When I see a, now there was just the latest one today is a Chinese food delivery guy gets  his ass fucking handed to him by a bunch of savages that ordered food.  He shows up.  They beat him down trying to get money off him.  He had no fucking money.  I guess they stole the Chinese food.  That's not what that was about.  But it's savage fucking animals doing it.  And I'm basing that opinion on what I believe is the content of their character, not the color  of their skin. 
[01:50:30]  I agree.  So when I call them fucking animals, am I being racist?  No.  No.  But just because you say that and people think you're being racist and they're wrong, it  doesn't make my point wrong either.  No, no.  You should say they're animals if they beat a guy like that.  Because in a different job position that I'm in right now, I would get fired.  Yeah, that's true.  If I went around and said savage fucking animals, I would get fired because I would be saying,  oh my God, that's a racist thing to say.  No, I'm basing it on the fact that they beat up a poor Chinerman that's just trying to deliver 
[01:51:00]  food.  Do you get deliveries to your house?  Yeah.  Maybe they beat him up because he didn't have fucking change.  They always have change for me.  No, they don't.  It's frustrating as all hell.  Anthony, Mr. Anthony, how are you today?  It's frustrating when they don't have change.  Yeah?  Yes.  I can see why you would want to beat up a delivery guy.  Mine always has change.  I have it so many times.  I'm like, your job, you need change for your job.  Let me tell you something.  One time when I didn't have change, I had 100.  And he didn't have change of 100. 
[01:51:30]  He gave it to me for nothing and said, next time, next time.  And then like a couple of days later, the guy remembered.  That wasn't a Chinese guy.  Yeah, it was.  No way.  What was it?  I'm shocked.  And I'm not even going for...  No, no.  No, I...  I'm a regular.  Remember how Patrice was talking about how they don't give you nothing?  Oh, they give you nothing?  Well, this was an anomaly then.  Did you see the story?  You just reminded me of something.  Yeah.  Some guy had some kind of incident in the Chinese restaurant where an ambulance was called. 
[01:52:00]  They're hauling him into the ambulance.  You saw the story, Danny?  And the fucking...  The Chinese waiter or the owner of the place, I don't know who will get the story,  is handing the guy a bill as they're hauling him into an ambulance.  He wanted to get paid.  I swear to God.  I don't want this to seem racist, but the fucking Chinese, they're like the fucking Jews.  I'll explain later.  That's not racist.  We'll find the story.  But the guy was handing him his bill as they were loading him into an ambulance. 
[01:52:30]  Was it...  Who's the comedian that...  A baby lance.  Dude, was it...  If it's Kevin Hart, I'm going to vomit that I'm quoting him.  No.  Who was the comic that said that black...  Oh, it might have...  Ah!  That black people...  No, it was Bill Burr.  Fucking Bill Burr.  His joke about how you put the curse after the ethnicity and it's not racist.  But if you put it before...  Oh, my God.  Somebody quoted it to me.  I thought it was brilliant.  It is brilliant.  Like, black guys would say, look at that Chinese motherfucker. 
[01:53:00]  But a white guy would go, you know, look at him.  He's fucking Chinese.  And it just sounds...  Something like that sounds more racist.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking...  It's a point that I really want to smash Bill for making.  It's fucking hilarious.  Really smart.  That's fucking really good.  I need the Chinese story on my Twitter if someone has it.  Please.  Danny's looking, too.  Ah, it's a good fucking...  I think...  Somebody tweeted that to me the other day and was commenting about how right Patrice is.  Big mama prods on Twitter.  I think, you know, there just needs to be a little more pride, a little more sense of community and family. 
[01:53:30]  And I think a lot of problems would be solved that way instead of instantly screaming racist and throwing out the race card and blaming.  The blame that goes on is astonishing to me.  Danny, can you read the basics on that one for me, please?  Man handed food bill inside an ambulance.  I can see that from here.  That says, you had chow mein.  A man who suffered a seizure while eating at a Chinese restaurant in Melbourne was handed his bill as he was being loaded into an ambulance. 
[01:54:00]  That's amazing.  Wow.  An unidentified man fell to the ground after suffering an apparent seizure at St. Kilda's Sifu Dumpling Express.  Oh, my God.  Of course you would have a seizure.  I would have a seizure there.  Why would you go there?  As he was getting into the ambulance and his friend climbed in to join him, a waiter came out and handed him.  You'll pay bill.  You'll pay bill.  It's not great.  The man's companion said the restaurant's actions were just so inappropriate. 
[01:54:30]  Of course.  Yeah.  What do they want?  Not to pay the bill?  Because fucking old fucking leaky brain McKillicuddy decides to fucking pop lock on the floor?  They're not supposed to get paid for the food they sold?  Well, exactly.  And it says restaurant manager Kevin Tien told the newspaper he did not think it was inappropriate.  Quote, my opinion is that they ate in our restaurant.  They have to pay.  That is a scumbag move.  To eat in the restaurant and then fucking have a seizure. 
[01:55:00]  How about you pay up?  How about you pay up fucking Edmund Muskie?  How about you pay up fucking Squish Brains?  You went with a Muskie reference.  Hey, fucking Jumping Bean Brains.  How about you fucking pay up?  It's no one's fault you got Jiffy Pop in your fucking brain.  Why should they fucking not get money for their fucking General Chow's Chicken?  Just besides, you want to fucking lay on the floor and do the worm from 1988.  Fucking assholes.  Doing a Humpty dance. 
[01:55:30]  They're trying to fucking get their money.  Take your fucking Chow Main Brains, if I may.  Fucking.  Boo.  We're going to have Brie Olsen in a few minutes, one of Charlie Sheen's goddesses.  I think she's still a goddess, even though she broke up with him on a text message recently.  I just look at her as lovely Brie.  Break up.  Can we squeeze in the Roger McDowell before that?  Yes.  Squeeze it.  Squeeze it.  Gloria Allred is involved.  Thanks, God. 
[01:56:00]  That's great.  Announcing complaints of Atlanta Braves coach Roger McDowell using homophobic, threatening language.  Homophobic?  Oh, yeah, in San Francisco.  Do I have to read the story, or is it all in these clips, hopefully?  Okay.  This might be part of her press conference.  We'll fill in the blanks if we have to.  Mr. Quinn was in the bleachers with his children at batting practice when he and his family observed Atlanta Braves coach Roger McDowell making some extremely rude and homophobic comments to three men who were also in the bleachers. 
[01:56:30]  Okay.  What's the problem?  I guarantee they were heckling and being obnoxious.  Yeah.  So Roger McDowell went after him.  So what's the problem?  I'll tell you what.  The guy with his family is probably going to sue, and they have this snitching, awful, fucking bitch lawyer.  She is fucking repulsive.  You might not like it, but what's the problem?  You should be able to do that.  Ball game at a baseball game. 
[01:57:00]  We're doomed.  We're snitches.  The whole country is fucking little babies and tattletales.  I like that.  We're doomed.  Fucking God.  I really hate Gloria Allred.  We're going to go back to that story in a minute, but first, the lovely and talented Brie Olson.  Hey, Brie.  Brie, it's been a while.  Hello.  Hello.  That sexy voice.  That Brie voice.  Yes.  How are you, Brie?  Wow.  Good.  I'm in Indiana.  You're in Indiana? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What time is it?  Oh, Jesus.  Same time as y'all?  Yeah, as y'all.  Wait, you're on East Coast time now?  Yeah.  I don't know why I thought it was later.  You're on the first time zone.  It takes a while to get to.  You're on the front cover of the May issue of Penthouse looking really, really fun.  My God.  Really nice.  Yeah, that's a great cover shot.  And then you got some nice pictorial with another girl.  You're lezzing out.  Yeah, you're lezzing out with another girl.  Lezzing out, as I like to say.  Yep.  Well, it's better being on that than these days being on New York Post and everything. 
[01:58:00]  Well, that's true.  You have gotten a lot of exposure of late.  Well, not this much exposure.  I get it.  Hey, Brie, are you still doing movies or are you only doing shoots?  You know, I'm not sure right now.  I'm getting ready to go to L.A. for a few photo shoots, and I may end up dabbling into  movies again.  When's the last time you actually shot a film?  Um, it's been a few months now, but I haven't, you know, it never came out of my mouth that 
[01:58:30]  I retired or anything like that.  Right, right, right.  So, um, you know, I've just been busy with other things.  By the way, that's Jim Norton talking.  Do you know Jim?  Do you remember Jim?  I think you know Jim.  Yes.  Teasing, of course.  Now, so, was it a girl-girl, the last one you shot?  Or was it, like, guy-girl?  I don't remember.  Oh, nice.  She doesn't even remember.  I don't, because everything kind of came suddenly and off guard. 
[01:59:00]  Like, I wasn't expecting to be out of the industry.  Oh, then it was a guy.  Certainly.  Yeah.  What the hell are you, what are you, what are you, what are you doing in Indiana?  Like, you seem to keep going back there.  Is it, is it just to kind of breathe for a minute?  Yeah, I just built a house out here, um, this past summer, so.  Wow, yourself?  Uh, yeah, all by myself.  See, that's very hard to do.  The camera's out, and then, yeah.  Yeah.  It started whittling away.  Um, no, but, so, I've been working on that, and just, uh, well, it's all done now, but 
[01:59:30]  I've just been decorating, and just hanging out with my friends.  You know, I grew up here, so my family's here, and everything.  Yeah.  Who's lucky enough to be Brie Olsen's neighbor?  Can you imagine?  Oh, man.  My neighbor sucks.  I'd invest in, like, binoculars and fucking telescopes and camera equipment.  Although, you know.  Tunneling equipment.  I could see her naked, just get a magazine or a movie.  Silly.  It's just, can you imagine if she was right next door to you?  No, that'd be great.  Hey, Brie, how long, how long into this, like, whole thing that you've been having happen, 
[02:00:00]  how long into it did you realize, like, this is going way farther than you would have thought?  Like, it was getting much more publicity than you would have thought.  Um, you know, I, I honestly, I, I didn't really think about any of that beforehand.  I just, you know, it was like, I don't know.  Because you're famous.  I mean, you're very well known in the industry, and even people out of the industry know you.  But this was like, all of a sudden, mainstream press. 
[02:00:30]  I thought you handled it really well.  Like, you didn't do anything crazy or stupid.  And I, and I know that even myself, I certainly probably would have fucking blown it.  But, uh, how did you keep things under control so well?  I don't, I don't know.  I mean, well, I'm, I don't really have a crazy lifestyle to begin with.  I'm pretty, um, laid back and almost boring, you know, in my regular life.  So I guess that just kind of showed when, you know, all, our whole lives are basically 
[02:01:00]  being documented.  And I was just kind of in the background.  I remember this one interview, there were all these camera crews in our house and everything,  and everyone else was talking.  And then the camera goes to me, they're like, do you have anything to say?  I'm like, uh, go vegan.  You know?  So, that's just, it's kind of how it was.  And I just kind of, I don't know, it was, it was a lot for me.  Did you find that people were trying to, like, cat, like, because the media is so repulsive.  Did you find, like, whenever they would, whether they would talk to, to Charlie or the other 
[02:01:30]  girl, were they trying to, like, catch you by saying something, like, or trying to trip  you up?  Because they, they don't seem to like to do straight, just straight interviews.  Well, it doesn't even matter.  You know, after that whole thing, I realized that all those magazines and just the press  and just, everyone gets the story so backwards.  And, like, um, on television interviews, they completely edited it and chop it up any way  that they want to.  And it's amazing.  You could give a perfectly good interview.  And unless that's live, you know, like I said, they can edit it any way they want and 
[02:02:00]  make anyone look, you know?  Ridiculous.  And it's like the thing to do, and I forget who did this.  It was a wrestler or somebody who actually taped, oh, it was someone who did O'Reilly,  and they taped the full interview themselves, and then when O'Reilly released it edited,  they released it the way it was, and they kind of made a fool out of O'Reilly because  it was very obvious that he had edited it kind of shitty, and they do do that unless  it's live, like you said.  Well, good.  I wish more people would see that because, you know, the general public, Middle America 
[02:02:30]  and everything, they don't realize that.  They just watch the news and they just assume everything that they read is true.  Were you guys kind of acting a little bit just to kind of punch things up for the cameras,  especially at the beginning when it was, it must have been fun at some moment before  it got a little out of control, but was there kind of a thing when the cameras weren't around  like, okay, next time we get on the press thing, let's do this or that?  No. 
[02:03:00]  No?  Really?  No.  Because sometimes it seems a little calculated.  No.  I mean, it couldn't seem that way, like I said, because the way people edited things  and stuff, you know, so it's like the 2020 piece, for example, they interviewed me and  the other girl for like half an hour, and they ended up using like one minute of us, you  know?  It was just one certain sentence that I said or that she said.  Did it make you look bad?  Because they have to do that in an interview, but do they do it, do you think, to try to get 
[02:03:30]  a certain angle on the story, or do they just think...  They do it to make it look as dramatic as possible.  Right, right.  So, you know, anything they can do to make it, because people love drama, you know, if  everything is calm and happy, no one's going to watch that.  They're like, that's boring.  That's like my life.  Why would I watch that?  Were you thinking at all of marriage recently?  Like, not that you planned on it, but was there a party that thought, maybe, you know,  maybe things are a little crazy, but they can settle down?  No comment.  All right.  That's not a no. 
[02:04:00]  I mean, I'm saying it might be just an instinct for people to start thinking that.  I mean, I know I probably would if I was in that situation.  Are you at least happy with the way things are?  I'm so happy now.  I'm happy to be back home and have my own life and be doing my own thing.  And, you know, I just, it's good to be home and good to be on my own program.  Yeah.  It definitely motivated me to want to do things mainstream, but not in that fashion, though. 
[02:04:30]  Like, I'm sure a lot of people assumed that I had done that, like, to try to get, like,  my 15 minutes or something, but I don't know if anyone has noticed or not.  But unlike all the other girls that were involved with Charlie, I've never went and did any  interviews after Charlie and I, you know.  Yeah, that's kind of true, right?  I've never, you know, and these people, they're vultures.  They offer you a lot of money, you know, and it's like, I'm not interested in that.  I just, you know, it was an experience for me. 
[02:05:00]  You can make your own money off of those nice tits of yours.  Jesus Christ.  You see those fucking things?  So, I was just, I was open, you know, to just going through an experience, you know,  a life experience that a lot of people, you know, they can't say that they'll ever do in  their lives.  But it definitely encouraged me to want to do some mainstream stuff.  So, I'm actually planning on getting an apartment in L.A., and I hope to get involved in some  classes and basically start from the bottom up just like any other person would do. 
[02:05:30]  Honestly, you really didn't come off at all like you were looking to capitalize on it  because, again, there were no interviews.  You weren't doing anything crazy or it was amazing to me because, again, I know that I  probably would have buckled.  And when you're in a situation like that, like after a while, did you start to be, you  know, because you're Brie, you're very well known in what you do.  Was there a part of you that kind of resented being one of the goddesses and you just kind  of wanted your own individuality back?  Did that bother you at all?  Yeah.  Yeah, it did.  I mean, who would want to be just, you know, put into, categorized into a group when for 
[02:06:00]  so long of a time, I've been my own person and I was already my own person publicly.  So, I knew what it felt like, you know.  And, you know, it's just, I had to watch everything I said and I still do, you know.  I mean, my Twitter hasn't been the same because it's like, oh, what if I post this?  These people are going to take it wrong.  So, that's kind of sucked.  Were you a, I get very jealous.  Like, I've had a few threesomes in my life and I don't know how people do it, maybe 
[02:06:30]  because I'm insecure.  Whatever moments where you'd kind of just like, hey, look, I wish this was just me and  this person and there was nobody else here or did you not care about that?  No comment.  Okay.  So, that's a maybe.  No comment isn't a no.  I know I would have gotten, I get, I won't say possessive like a psycho, but I get a little  bit.  Are you, are you by nature a jealous girl at all?  No.  No.  See, Jim.  If you were to ever talk to any of my ex-boyfriends or anything, that would be the last thing  they would say.  That you were, you really didn't care?  Oh, really?  No. 
[02:07:00]  What does it take to make you jealous?  Because I have my, my limits as well.  What does it take to make me jealous?  Yeah, meaning.  That's a really good question.  Meaning, because for me, it's not necessarily, hey, my, the girl I'm with fucks somebody else  who is a great fuck, it can be some kind of a weird emotional thing or this weird shit  that will, will sometimes trigger jealousy for me.  I didn't, jealousy is such an ugly emotion and I try not to involve it in my life.  I would say the only thing that would really make me upset in a relationship is someone  that lies and, you know, that would like sleep with the girl behind my back or something. 
[02:07:30]  I mean, if we had an open relationship about it, then that would be one story, but there's  nothing that bothers me more than someone that would lie to me because that means there's  no relationship there at all.  And if you had an open relationship, would it bother, because I've had a couple of those  and here's where they tend to get hairy.  If you're in an open relationship and then there's that one person you don't want the  person to sleep with or if it's somebody you know, there's always like a weird catch  in open relationships. 
[02:08:00]  See, I've never done that.  That's another thing.  Any, anyone, I've never set rules because I'm like, you know, what's the point in saying,  okay, go do whatever you want, but not really.  You can't do this and this and this and this.  And I'm like, there's not going to be anything like that.  But if I had advice just to give to anyone that's like, oh my gosh, that, you know, that  has to be so cool to have open relationships.  And I wish my wife was like that.  It really is like, there's a reason that it started with like two people and just like 
[02:08:30]  couples and everything.  And I just think it's a lot more intimate with two people.  I mean, even in my scenes, you know, when I was shooting movies, I always preferred  one-on-one because it's like you can give each other your full attention and just become  a lot closer than, you know, if it's three people, then that's more time you have to  split between more people.  So I would say just in general relationships are better one-on-one.  And you look really great.  Honestly, the penthouse spread, you look, you're on the cover and you look fantastic. 
[02:09:00]  And the spread with the other girl is really, really hot.  Sexy.  Did you, did you like, I saw a picture of you on stage and it was like, you were, you were,  you were dressed pretty casually, at least from the one photo I saw, right?  Yeah.  There's a long story behind that.  What, what, did you want to dress different or did you not want to dress different?  No comment.  Okay.  Um, did you like being on stage in front of that many people?  I didn't mind.  No, it doesn't bother me.  Any stage fright or no?  No.  No?  No.  So how was the, uh, how was the ovation there from the, uh, the crowd? 
[02:09:30]  Cause I've read some things and again, the press, who the fuck knows, but, um, was it,  was it welcoming or was it, were there hecklers?  What was going on?  It was, I mean, during, as soon as the show opens, it's unbelievable.  Like no matter what Charlie does, everyone still loves him so much.  And, um, you know, so there were standing ovations at any show that I had been to.  No, that was people walking out, Brie. 
[02:10:00]  Uh, well, the.  You have to stand out before you walk out.  No, in Detroit, um, you know, obviously there were tweaks and everything that were made after  that show.  Yeah.  But after that, it was pretty smooth sailing.  And then, yeah, I mean, occasionally people walked out or whatever, but.  Can I say what was impressive about that was the fucking, he got booed the first time.  It was, it was rough.  And the second night in Chicago, he did well.  And then like in New York, the radio city, this is the first show was, the show was tough. 
[02:10:30]  And then he talked shit in Connecticut and it was supposed to be a disaster.  And the second show in radio city was actually supposed to be good.  It was like, that was one thing as a standup.  I'm like, you know what?  He fucking adjusted quickly.  Right.  He knew he had to.  Yeah.  I was very impressed with that.  Cause I'm like, there's no way he's not going to be dead in front of all these people.  You just can't do that.  Was there a lot of panic behind the scenes?  People trying to put the show together?  Cause whatever they did, it seemed to start working.  You know, it's not a lot of people putting the show together.  It's basically Charlie and he's the one that makes the ultimate decisions. 
[02:11:00]  And then people might kind of throw an idea or something.  Um, but he came up with the whole thing on his own.  Um, and it's, and I think that's another thing that people expected was because he was on  two and a half men, a comedy show that I was going to be, uh, basically standup.  And it wasn't, it, that's not what the show is at all.  It was just him there to, you know, tell his stories and talk about truth and kind of,  you know, just for that audience to be in the mind of Charlie for an hour or so. 
[02:11:30]  I'm sorry.  What was your feelings?  Like as, as a friend, even because as a comic, like I love,  watching people fucking bomb, like there's nothing that makes me happier than seeing  one of my friends shit to bed.  Um, but you know, for a non-comic and he's not a comic, what was going through your mind  when you were watching those rough moments as, as like a friend of his and as a person  who cared about him?  Oh, no comments.  Would you be upset?  Or did you, or did you figure, ah, fuck it, he'll walk it off.  It won't be a big deal.  Uh, no comments. 
[02:12:00]  Well, that's not a bad question.  I don't think.  Um, let's see, uh, were you worried that you were going to have that problem when you  went out there or were you confident that things would be okay?  I didn't, you know, it was very quick for me.  I was really in and out.  Um, so I didn't like have like anything, no lines or anything like that.  You know, I spoke a few times in front of the audience, but for the most part, uh, just a  little eye candy.  Yeah, I guess so.  Was it hard as a performer? 
[02:12:30]  Cause you're, I mean, you're, you're not a background performer.  You're, you're, you're obviously, you know, you've won awards, uh, every, again, you, you,  I'm not being polite to you, you're fucking huge in the industry and you know, you're huge  in the industry.  Was it hard for you to take a kind of a background role, quote unquote?  You know, it was definitely different for me.  Um, yeah, it was, I mean, everyone prefers to be the one in the spotlight.  I don't care what anyone says, you know?  I mean, I wasn't jealous about it or angry about it at any rate. 
[02:13:00]  I mean, Charlie's worked very hard and he has a really long standing career.  So, um, that's to be expected, um, but yeah, I don't know.  Do you, do you, now you're happy to be back in Indiana.  Um, I mean, we have to ask, I mean, what, what, if you don't, you don't want to get too  detailed, you don't have to, but what made you want to leave?  I mean, did you get sick and tired of just the life or did you just miss home?  Oh, no comment, definitely.  The no comments, let me just tell you, I could give you guys very short answers or untrue 
[02:13:30]  answers, but I don't want to do that because I'm not a liar.  So I'd rather just say no comment.  That's fine.  I mean, we're not, we're not freaked out by it.  I mean, you know, it's, it's, it's cool.  You talk about what you want to talk about.  You know, we like you, it's, you know, but we have to ask.  I mean, obviously, you know, we, we can't not ask.  I mean, otherwise we're morons.  Is it that you were, I don't blame you.  Is it that you were just sick of watching Apocalypse Now?  Maybe that was it.  If you guys, if you guys see Casey Jordan on the air, I mean, you know, if you get girls  like that, then you know, you can ask any question you want. 
[02:14:00]  I would actually, honestly, I would rather talk to you because they, they will say anything  to any radio show.  Uh, and there's, there's no fun in that.  It's almost like who gives a fuck.  We know what they're doing.  They're just trying to, to, to grab a headline for themselves before it goes away.  I would rather talk to, you know, at least have a real answer from somebody.  Brie, are you out for good?  Cause some people say that you're still a goddess.  You're still one of Charlie's goddesses and you're just taking a little break.  No, I'm my own goddess.  Oh, you just want, she just wants to move on. 
[02:14:30]  Sometimes you want to just move on and it's like, you know, certain, how was I, how, let's  just say this in a very general term, how in the last few months, no people named  how were your sexual experiences?  Were they good, bad, or average?  I can't speak of that because I don't mind talking about my own sexual experiences, but  everyone knows the people that I was involved with and I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate  their sexual experiences being put out there.  Oh shit.  Wasn't, wasn't good.  Well, yeah, I might not be bad, but it might've been a little odd because my guess is you  were bored. 
[02:15:00]  My guess is you were bored after a while.  How about this?  Is it hard to sleep with regular guys after, when you're in the business?  I asked Bella Donna's husband this too.  Like I didn't know how he did it.  Like, is it hard to sleep with regular guys after, after being in the business?  Cause the guys are perfectly built and professionals.  Um, no, not at all.  Like just like civilians.  You mean?  Yeah, just people that don't do that for a living, that have regular dicks or regular 
[02:15:30]  bodies and have a regular staying power.  You know what I mean?  And I don't know.  You tell me, Jimmy.  Well, I, I, I would love to believe that you certainly enjoyed it.  I mean, I know for me, I ran down the hallway making whooping noises.  That's a great question.  Do you still have a little something for Jimmy?  Jimmy will always be in my heart.  Thank you very much.  We're friends.  We stayed friendly.  Who is better, Jimmy or Charlie? 
[02:16:00]  Oh God.  I don't want the answer to that.  Charlie is too crazy sounding to not be a decent funk.  I, I know the guy's at least a really crazy good lay, so I don't even want to be compared  to that guy.  I tend to be mellower than people think I'm going to be.  Yeah.  I'm a little bit mellower.  Was there ever just a conversation that actually was intelligible and like, hey, that's kind  of cool.  Or was it always catchphrases?  There's a lot of catchphrases and, uh, and lines and stuff. 
[02:16:30]  I would just imagine a conversation like, hey, uh, yeah, that show was pretty good.  Yeah, yeah, that was fun.  Or, yeah, yeah, yeah, you want to take a shower or something?  Have a conversation.  You got to care about the other person.  Not like, you know, hey, I got a rocket rocking into the shower and cleanse the body of the  God that I, it's like, why were you just taking a shower?  Lighten up.  Was there ever a point where, uh, you were still enjoying yourself, but where you looked  in the mirror and you were like, ugh, I'm all right already.  Oh, goodness.  Uh.  We all have them. 
[02:17:00]  Can't really say.  Um.  This is one that everybody wants to know, so we'll just.  I think the answer to that is absolutely.  Possibly.  I mean, sometimes a no comment is telling.  It's not a definite yes.  I like that we just make up our own answers.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll just make them up.  I have a feeling there wasn't a lot of sex going on.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Um, let's just say this.  Everybody has been asking, uh, is the guy sober?  Um, I mean, it's a fairly, I thought that people were trying to throw him under the bus  and saying he was using, and I actually didn't think he was using.  He seemed to me like just somebody who had probably been up for a couple of days and kind 
[02:17:30]  of having that, you know, hey, uh, getting used to sobriety craziness, which all of us  kind of go through when we get sober.  Right.  Um, so were people just trying to throw him under the bus or did he take a little while?  I mean, is he doing all right?  Because I actually liked the guy.  Yeah, he's not using any drugs.  Hmm.  Okay.  Oh, drugs.  But a little, uh, a little alcohol here and there.  Oh, goodness.  A little wine, maybe.  Who doesn't like a beer, too?  A little wine, I'm thinking.  I'm thinking a beer guy.  Wine's safe.  Maybe a, maybe a beer. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  What do you think?  Yeah, beer.  Well, is it a point where it's not addictive anymore, where it's just a social thing?  I mean, some people stop using the hard drugs, uh, and at least drink socially without  fucking abusing drugs.  I've never seen him drink or use illegal drugs.  Oh, all right.  Um, or do you drink or no?  Rarely.  Oh, rare.  Okay.  It's easier if you're around people who aren't fucking loaded all the time.  You know, it's like when you're cleaning up, it helps to be around people who are having  a drink once in a while as opposed to fucking, you know, people that are piping it in.  Yeah, drinks vegan vodka. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, no, I like that.  And actually, the whole time that I was over at Charlie's, I never even did have a sit  because, you know, it's like, I, it's not something that I ever, like I said, I usually  just do it on occasions or something.  So I just didn't do it at all.  I just had respect for him.  Sure.  And we believe that he wasn't using.  That was our take on it, if you remember, Jimmy.  Yeah, I didn't think he was either.  We were saying he was more manic from maybe coming down from some stuff.  Yeah.  We didn't think he was still using it at all.  It doesn't sound like there was that crazy of a time going on over there. 
[02:19:00]  Like, was it pretty civil, just kind of watching movies and hanging out?  No, it wasn't that.  Oh, really?  No, I can tell you, it wasn't that.  It was, um, a lot of, a lot of work, a lot of cameras there all the time and interviews  and putting the show together and there were always people there and it was very much just  the, the show, the, the focus every day from wake up to bed was the show.  Was it hard to, and I hate to say it, like, I can't, I don't know how to phrase this. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, I'm going to sound like the fucking fruitiest guy, but did you feel like when,  when a lot of this stuff is happening that like your needs weren't being met?  Like, I don't mean that in some corny way, but it's like, it's like, Hey, look, I need  attention to, or I need to be taken care of on some level, um, just as a person.  And when all the focus is on one individual, sometimes that's hard for the people around them.  No comment.  All right.  That's a possibility.  That's a possibility.  There was no sex going on.  Uh, but it's hard if, if some, it's almost like when somebody is going through something, 
[02:20:00]  then almost, I feel guilty if I have something that I need addressed because the other person's  issues seem a lot worse than what I'm dealing with.  So maybe that's what it was.  Yeah.  IDK.  IDK.  Oh, I don't know.  Did you, uh, did you really break up with them through a text message?  No, I didn't.  I left in Canada.  Oh.  Oh, see, that's a rumor.  It's another fucking rumor.  Yeah.  That's out there pretty strongly.  It was from Twitter.  All right.  Yeah.  That you just, uh, you said goodbye on, uh, through a text message. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  So you left in Canada and did it make you laugh when you hear about the fucking bullshit  that people throw out about what happened?  Not ha ha funny laugh, but like annoyed.  Um, like as far as the press and everything goes, what they're saying?  Yeah.  Or just like, again, like Ope said, like, did, did they, you know, there was a rumor going  around that you broke up with them via text and that seemed like a little cold.  And now you're saying, no, you just, you just left in Canada and that was that.  Yeah.  Uh, it's, it's annoying.  Yeah.  Do you want to correct people? 
[02:21:00]  I'm sorry.  Do you want to correct people when you hear that?  Do you want to like fucking email the person and go, Hey, fuckhead, you got it wrong?  Correct.  If I really wanted to that badly, I would do interviews, but it's not that important to  me.  I don't really care.  Okay.  Are you, are you going to go back on the tour?  No.  That's it.  You're done.  Ski.  Comedians are so much easier than actors who make a lot of money.  We're, we're very low maintenance.  That's the beauty of us.  And you left in Canada.  Was it your choice or, or he basically hinted that it was time for you to move on? 
[02:21:30]  No, I, I left.  On your terms?  No, uh, nobody knew I was leaving.  Ah, kind of.  Oh, you just said, okay, it's time to go.  Yeah.  And, uh, when you were, when you were heading for, I'm going to guess the airport, did you  keep checking, did you keep checking your, your text, hoping that somebody noticed that  you left or, or, or.  No.  Oh, you didn't.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  I waited until I got through customs before I even told anyone. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, there's an, there is an important point here.  Charlie was the one that said on stage that, uh, Brie, uh, broke up or whatever through  a text message.  That's where that came from.  That wasn't even the media.  That was from Charlie himself.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  That's right.  Hmm.  What are those?  Do we hear animals in the background?  They're geese.  That's geese.  I hear geese.  Yes.  Oh my gosh.  They drive me crazy.  Let me tell you something.  Water may be a beautiful thing, but never move, never build a house next to water because 
[02:22:30]  these geese people, okay, I'm a vegan, so I don't need any meat or anything, but instead  of like turkeys, people need to start eating geese for like, Oh, is that you just want to  get rid of these fucking things?  Yeah.  They are noisy.  You want to shoot them for sport.  Yeah.  I don't eat them.  I just kill them.  Yeah.  Or just, you know what you want to do?  You want to capture them and punch them in their fucking, in their, in their geese sides.  Karate chop to their big, long necks.  Geese have the most punchable wing area because they're fucking loud and they're mean motherfuckers 
[02:23:00]  too.  They're not pleasant at all.  They got a great neck to choke.  They're disturbing my swans in the pond and everything.  Swans.  Wow.  Oh, they're also nasty though.  Swans are supposed to be fucking vicious too, right?  Well, that's why they put them in here is because they're supposed to keep the geese away,  but there's just, there's two to like a thousand, so it's not working very well.  Yeah.  Apparently you have a real like swan goose fuck-a-thon going out on your leg.  Shotguns keep geese away.  Yeah, that strategy backfired.  They're just having this fucking hybrid bird that's louder and meaner. 
[02:23:30]  Hey Brie, in all fairness, a lot of people are frustrated by the no comment thing.  We understand.  Will there come a time where you'll tell your side of the story?  I don't know.  As of now though, you're just leaving it alone?  I don't know, but who's saying that?  Are you guys getting in live feed from the listeners or something?  Yeah, we always have that.  They always, through Twitter and everything else.  Listen up listeners and Twitterers, I have told these guys more than I have told anything to anybody.  True. 
[02:24:00]  And it's, oh yeah, we got a few things out.  But the point, it's fine.  They want to know how Charlie fucked and they want to know what kind of drugs.  Oh, of course.  You know the deal.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's not, she's not doing that.  It's odd.  I don't even, I'm such a pervert.  I don't care about the drug.  Like, if he was fucking, if he was literally smoking coke out of one of the geese's hineys,  I wouldn't care.  All I care about is the sex.  That's where my perv mind goes.  Oh my goodness.  I mean, I probably would if there was something smoking out of a geese's ass.  I'm exaggerating.  That would be interesting.  Was Jimmy good? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  No comment.  Does he have a big hog?  Yeah.  God bless her.  You definitely have taken some acting classes.  She's very good.  Yes.  Look, Jimmy, this is what I got to do.  She's not going to answer questions about Charlie.  She's going to answer questions about you, sir.  I don't think she remembers.  We were friends, but.  Is his penis.  No, I totally remember.  Okay, good.  I was just saying that, hoping you'd say that.  Thank you.  I was trying to be manipulative.  Is his penis bigger than normal?  Bigger than average? 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  Larger than average?  Yes.  And does he get a nice stiffy?  Yeah, of course.  I did.  Wow.  Does he have big balls?  I don't.  Oh, God.  I'll tell you.  I'll show you my bag.  And he's a really naughty texter, too.  We've had some good.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we have had some dirty ones.  Yeah?  Yeah, we've had some fucking very.  Dirty texting, though.  I mean.  They were fun, though.  They were actually.  You don't have to perform.  That's like saying hello to your grandma at this point.  Yeah, you're going to have to perform on texting.  We kissed a lot, too, if you remember that evening. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy needs to know.  Is he a good kisser?  I didn't need to.  That's what I was just going to say.  He is a very good kisser.  Oh, thank you.  Even with his bird lips?  Oh, goodness.  What I do when I kiss, my technique is I actually close my eyes and I violently tilt my head  to one direction.  I just lip lock and I start moving my tongue as fast as I can.  Women love that.  It's a very sexy technique.  That does sound good.  And I rub their shoulders vigorously.  Don't you keep your eyes wide open, too, when you kiss?  No, I slam them shut like there's a murder being committed in front of me. 
[02:26:00]  Because they like that.  No, it was a nice time.  It wasn't what you probably would have expected a creepy comic and a girl in adult films to  be like.  It was probably much more normal than people would have thought.  Well, Bree is ridiculously hot, man.  Yeah, and the penthouse is great.  Ridiculously hot.  The spread is really, really excellent.  Honestly, you look great on the cover.  And the girl, girl spread inside is very, very sexy.  Hey, what was it about Charlie that you liked? 
[02:26:30]  He's a handsome dude, honestly.  I mean, he's not an ugly guy.  When we met, he was just very charismatic and really intuitive and intelligent.  I was just really attracted to that.  Is he like he is on TV when you see?  And I don't mean just the quick sound bites that make anybody look nutty or anything like  that.  But does he come off a little more normal in real life when you're just hanging out without 
[02:27:00]  the cameras there than he does on camera?  I mean, it depends on the day.  Some days he's more hyper than other days.  When I first met him, though, he was very, very chill.  Like I said, laid back.  He was very laid back when him and I had first met.  That must be great, though, when he comes walking up to you.  I didn't even know who he was.  I had heard his name before, and I thought when I met him, I would, like, recognize them, 
[02:27:30]  but I didn't.  How great is that?  The hell you've been.  Jesus.  Here's the great part.  She recognized Jim Norton and not Charlie Sheen.  That really says a lot for how fucking certain awful things can work out in this world.  What horrible circles she's been in.  I know.  God almighty, you definitely need an upgrade in life if you recognize me and not him.  It's fucking...  But honestly, do you miss him or are you okay and you're past it?  No, I'm good.  I'm good, definitely. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, you strike me as the type when you're done, you're done.  Yeah, you know, and it's like, I mean, I'm with people for people.  I honestly, I don't care who they are or what they do or, you know, how much money they make  or anything.  I mean, obviously, or else I wouldn't have left.  So, you know, I was like...  Living the life of Riley over there, as they say.  It was cool for a bit, and then it was like, okay, it's not for me.  Time to go.  So I left.  And are you happy that it didn't go any further?  Like, you know, that you don't have to leave a marriage or there's no, you know, obviously 
[02:28:30]  there's no, you know, kids or anything involved.  It's got to be nice to be on your clean break.  Pick up and leave.  Yeah, I mean, you know, I have a clean slate.  I've never been married.  I don't have any kids, you know.  Thank God.  Don't ruin that fucking body.  Jesus.  Maybe she has a kid growing in her belly right now.  Oh, goodness gracious.  Throw yourself down those stairs.  Those new stairs you built.  Do you know how mad, not to be graphic, but do you know how mad I was at myself that  I pulled out?  I really was angry at myself, and I'm never mad that I pull out. 
[02:29:00]  Well, you want to share that thought?  You shared a thought with us before she called in.  You know, maybe it's time for you to have a no comment, Jim Norton.  Well, I just...  But she would be probably flattered by that.  Well, I wasn't, you know, at the times I've spoken about, I haven't, I've never said anything  nasty about you.  No, not at all.  It's always been very rave reviews and nice things.  But just that I, let's do this.  Like, I usually am fucking Pete pull out, and I aim for the fucking, the carpet.  You know, I mean, I want no mistakes. 
[02:29:30]  But I was like, fuck.  That was one instance where it was one of my greater regrets that I did.  I'm sure it's not a regret of yours.  I'm sure you've heard.  I'm sure if I didn't, you would have just stood in the middle of the room and jumped  up and down quickly.  Just to fucking, just to get rid of the fucking demon seed.  Would you have Jimmy's blinking baby?  Oh, he's adorable.  He basically said he didn't want to pull out, Brie.  I didn't.  He's in love.  Yeah.  It's, I'm not, because that makes me sound like an unhealthy, crazy person. 
[02:30:00]  I wouldn't say that, but it was just such a nice moment.  You're a healthy, crazy person.  No, but I felt in that moment.  Yeah.  That we just should have made a child.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That would have been something.  Yes.  I had that feeling, too.  Oh.  All right.  Well, there's plenty of time.  I mean, I'm 42.  I'm looking younger and in as fine a shape as I did when you last saw me.  Pulling out is one of the hardest things to do.  It's fucking, most times it's fucking easy breezy.  You know that?  Yes.  I don't know if this is going to work, but I'll try it. 
[02:30:30]  I like that horse in Oregon.  That's how I fucking come.  Jimmy.  In a man's ass.  Jesus.  Jimmy's also touring the country doing his comedy thing, his anti-social thing.  I am, yes.  Selling out bigger places than Charlie Sheen, by the way.  I don't know about that.  Bigger places.  No, because all she had to do was look on the website and go, oh, we did that theater,  not this one.  How great would it be if Brie also just showed up at one of the shows for little Jimmy Norton?  No comp tickets.  Oh, sorry, Brie.  Got to buy your own. 
[02:31:00]  Everybody pays.  How great.  The place would go nuts that little Jimmy Norton's friend came out just to support Jimmy.  I wouldn't, but I wouldn't honestly do it.  I'm fucking, I would, I would, this, I would be so, I wouldn't want to bring her out because  then it's just like, eh.  Then I'm, I'm just too fucking asking for somebody much better looking to come along  and fucking wreck my night.  So I probably would actually keep her fucking locked up in the, with the bounty in the fucking  cabinet.  Like, don't say nothing. 
[02:31:30]  If you have to go to the bathroom, knock twice.  I'll let you out.  All right.  Penthouse this month, very sexy.  I really wouldn't, I really wouldn't lock you up and just let you out to use the bathroom.  That was something serial killers say to their fucking victims before they masturbate into  their shoes.  And, um, it's what Jerome Brutus would say to people.  Um, but yeah, I'm happy to, I'm, I'm happy to hear that you're a single again and you  know, you're doing, uh, you're doing well.  You sound good.  She's doing her, uh, she's doing Brie. 
[02:32:00]  Um, what are we promoting Brie?  I know the penthouse is out.  Yeah.  I know the penthouse is out.  You're on the cover.  Once again, it's the May issue.  You see it right on the cover and like Anne said, uh, nice, a nice spread where she's  lezzing out.  Yes.  Lezzing.  It is a very, very sexy spread.  Did Jimmy, uh, eat your pussy?  Ask her nicer.  Let's ask her nicer.  How do you, how do you ask that nicely?  Oral sex.  I thought that was being nice.  No, she's a nice girl.  Did you guys have, uh, say did you and Jim have oral sex?  Oral sex is there to go with that? 
[02:32:30]  And then she'll probably say, Jim, should I say?  And I'll say, Brie, you can certainly say that we both did that really nicely to each other.  Oh my goodness.  But I don't want to, I don't want to speak for you.  Did he awkwardly sniff your hiney?  Oh my goodness.  There's no awkwardness when Jimmy sniffs a hiney.  He's a professional.  No.  No, hold on.  Don't blow up my spot here.  We had a very, very, uh, let's just say a very nice.  No, Jimmy talks about it as a very, he doesn't really talk in detail about it, by the way.  Nah, but I've always spoken about it nicely.  He really, really likes you. 
[02:33:00]  Well.  I could tell.  Who wouldn't?  Yeah, that's why he kept blowing me off.  I didn't know you blow off Brie Olsen.  I didn't blow off Brie, but.  It's supposed to be the other way around.  I honestly, we're both, we both travel extensively.  And, uh, I haven't, I haven't seen you in probably, you were in studio once in the last  two years.  That's the last time I saw you.  You keep on getting these girlfriends though, Jimmy.  I know.  Oh shit.  Jimmy's a good guy.  I'm actually, believe me, there's been.  There was a few times he was shaken.  And I, I have not broken. 
[02:33:30]  I mean, I, I know.  I've been a, uh, a good boy.  I mean, all right.  Look, this transsexual porn town is cheating.  Let's certainly hope not.  Well, because if it does, I'm the cheating kid.  I do.  But, um, yeah, no, I have not, I haven't even seen Brie in probably over two years.  Two years?  Wow.  No, since the last time she was here.  It's a while now.  When are you going to be in New York again?  We would love to have you come in and, uh, just hang.  Goodness.  I don't know.  But when I come, I will for sure come in.  Okay, good.  Yeah, that'd be nice. 
[02:34:00]  And it's, uh, Brie Olson on Twitter.  And, uh, yeah.  Yes.  At Brie Olson.  B-R-E-O-L-S-O-N.  And what is your, what is your, um, you have a website or are you just doing Twitter?  BrieOlson.com.  Okay.  And, uh, the pet house, is it in, is it in stores now?  Yes.  Oh.  It's on stands right now.  Okay.  You know what?  We were focused so much on Charlie.  I don't know.  There might be more, no comments, whatever.  But I got to ask about the, the, the, uh, DUI thing.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  No, what's up with that? 
[02:34:30]  What?  Well, you just pled guilty, I guess.  Yeah, I did.  One of those nights, eh?  It was just one of those nights, huh?  No, it really wasn't.  I slept on ice and I honestly don't remember what happened after that.  I, uh, wrecked my car and I, I don't remember.  I woke up and I was in, in jail and I must have hit my head or something.  Damn.  That's scary though, right?  That's a good one.  You don't remember it?  Stick to that.  I mean, it's like, you know, anytime I drink, I've, I've always had, you know, my entourage 
[02:35:00]  with me.  You know, it's, it wasn't even that late.  I went to meet with one of my friends here at a local club because he wanted me to, uh,  do, like, covers and ads for him.  And so we were having a meeting about that and I was driving home and it was like 11  o'clock at night, wasn't even that late and, um, sled on ice.  And that's the last thing I remember was sliding.  Wow.  And then you woke up in jail?  Yeah.  That sucks.  Did that make you not want to drink and drive again?  Dude, I, I seriously, I had two beers. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  That's scary.  Oh my God.  It's fucking scary.  What the hell did that happen?  Two beers?  Well, she's small too, so I had registered something.  Maybe a roofie in there or something.  And it was like, um, you know, we were, we were going to take it to trial and everything,  obviously, because I'm like, I'm not going to, you know, plead guilty to something that  I didn't do.  And I don't have a criminal record at all.  I mean, nothing.  I haven't, I'm, you know, very law abiding.  And, um, so we were going to take it to trial. 
[02:36:00]  And then my attorney, he got ahold of the tapes and everything from the jail.  And you can tell I'm not drunk, but because, but I was conscious though.  And I was just, and I wasn't slurring or anything, but I was insulting the officers.  And I kept asking for my attorney and I kept telling them to let me go and that I was  a vegan and that I should be let go because.  Oh shit.  That's gotta, that's gotta be hilarious.  Yeah.  And it was, and I was like, after I seen that, I'm like, a jury is never going to sympathize 
[02:36:30]  with me.  No, they're going to say she's hammered and.  Yeah.  But, you know, but, um, you know, I wasn't, like I said, I wasn't, and I wasn't like six  inches of lettuce and I wasn't like swaying or tipping over anything.  I was perfectly straight in the, in the tests and their little yellow line they had.  And like you said, not slurring at all, but just, and I don't even remember that.  I don't, I'd arrest you too though.  I don't arrest you.  Especially if she, especially if she hit her head and fucking.  Mean officer. 
[02:37:00]  Oh my God.  I'd be off the force in a second.  They'd catch me in the backseat.  Just fucking her.  It'd be terrible.  No, I can't believe I just, she just took me to the hospital.  What?  Because my car was completely totaled.  It was a brand new 2010.  I know.  It's just fucking.  Your head just crushed it.  My perv switch would go off and I would just lose it.  Open up.  Imagine that.  You'd come up to a car that slid on the ice and hit something and there's some damsel  in the fucking driver's seat, just kind of semi-conscious.  And a blouse popped open.  And you're probably just thinking, yeah, you're probably just thinking it's some fucking, 
[02:37:30]  you know, hag that's gone home or something.  And you pull up, it's Brie Olsen.  My dick would be out so fucking fast.  Dude, and you know what the thing is?  Holy shit.  Seriously, they probably, I mean, who knows?  Because we asked for all the video surveillances of the cop cars.  Oh, funny.  One squad car turned in the tape.  Oh, boy.  And six cops did not turn in their tapes and said that they were non-existent.  Yeah, yeah.  The camera's all broke.  Oops.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  You should have fought this because it's very suspicious that they got you and you only 
[02:38:00]  drank two beers.  Did you wake up with what you thought was strudel icing on your back?  No, no, I didn't.  Oh, okay.  No, I didn't.  Just making sure.  But, yeah.  Like I said, it was really screwy and it was really messed up and I was going to take it  to trial.  But it's like, and especially, it couldn't have happened at a worse time with Charlie involved  and everything.  And I was like, well, great.  You know, how is everyone going to look at me now?  So, I just was like, whatever.  And, you know, I can get it off my record in a few years with good behavior and everything, 
[02:38:30]  which I won't have a problem with.  So, I'm not worried about it.  No, it's weird.  It says here she's got to serve one year of unsupervised probation.  What is that?  She doesn't have to go see it all.  Double secret probation.  Right.  They'll just know.  Yeah.  Hey, I think you should have went to trial.  I mean, I don't know how you don't think a jury would believe the I wasn't drunk vegan  argument.  That's worked in many, many DUI cases.  You don't understand.  That wasn't liquor.  That was tofu.  I was vomiting. 
[02:39:00]  Do you have trouble going to regular restaurants?  It's not that bad.  I mean, some places like Olive Garden, they put egg and milk in everything because like  vegan, it's so extreme.  Like even noodles, you have to make sure they're not made out of egg.  And even like red sauces, sometimes they'll put butter in it and I can eat butter.  So, it's like, it's really extreme.  So, literally Olive Garden, there's nothing there that I can eat.  Nothing.  Unless I got their lettuce plain in a bowl.  Oh, wow. 
[02:39:30]  But most restaurants, you know, I can get like spinach salad or, you know, something else  or noodles if they're not made out of egg and stuff like that.  That's crazy.  It's like such, it's so restricting on what you could eat.  Any reason?  Is it health or fucking like morality?  I read this awesome book.  It was actually a New York Times bestseller book.  It was called How to Annoy Everyone I Go Out to Dinner With.  No, no.  They're not.  Everyone's usually really interested.  Is this the book that I wrote?  Animals.  They're not just for eat.  I was going to say they're for fucking, but I just couldn't say it. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  So, what was the book?  It's called Skinny Bitch.  And there's also a male version called Skinny Bastard.  And it's actually when I was on the heavier side about a year ago now.  And I got up to a little over 140.  And I was like, I just need to make a change.  So, I got on my iPhone and I went to iBooks and I downloaded this book, which I thought  was just going to be a diet book.  You know, they really fool you with a name called Skinny Bitch.  And I started reading it and it turned out to be a lot about veganism. 
[02:40:30]  And usually, I mean, I'm an Indiana girl.  I love steak and potatoes and all that.  And I literally read that book in one sitting and switched overnight and never ate meat or  anything again.  Why not just vegetarian?  Why full on vegan?  Because vegetarian, there's still dairy and eggs and all that.  And that's still really fattening.  And it also supports the veal industry.  And, you know, I can go into that for days.  But I've always been an animal lover. 
[02:41:00]  And so, you know, I got all animal rights.  Which film is that?  Oh, sorry.  I'm teasing, of course.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  LOL.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  LOL, winky face.  Oh, well.  Well, Brie, thanks for calling us.  You're hot as fuck.  Yeah, you look, again, you look really good in the, and, you know, I don't buy magazines  much.  And I was given this one for free, so I don't have to buy it.  But this is a fucking very good issue.  So, congratulations on a great shoot. 
[02:41:30]  You certainly made a nice one to come back to.  Thank you.  And we'll see you when you're in New York.  You're welcome to come in any time.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  It was good talking to you again.  And I'm glad you're doing okay.  You sound like you're fine.  Thank you.  I love you guys.  All right.  We'll talk to you soon.  All right, Brie.  All right.  Bye, Brie.  Brie Olsen, everyone.  From Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Yeah, like, there are no comments.  I'll tell you why they didn't bother me.  Because she wasn't seeking out, like, hey, I need to, you know, she hasn't been talking  to anybody.  So, it's like, yeah.  She said she gave us more than anyone else.  And I haven't heard her say anything to anybody. 
[02:42:00]  I kind of respect it.  Because she's not exploiting it.  No.  She certainly could fucking make a shitload.  Dude, she could be doing a lot.  Yeah, because that's why it's hard to just go, well, fuck you if you're not talking.  It's like, yeah, you know, she hasn't said anything.  She's been offered a lot of fucking money to say shit.  But some of the no comments I didn't understand.  I think there's other things going on that even the press hasn't picked up on.  That she's kind of keeping on the DL, as they say.  I think my thought is that she was done with Charles Sheen a long fucking time ago. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  And then it turned into this thing.  And maybe it became a business arrangement or something.  I don't know.  A little publicity kind of a thing.  And she got kind of stuck.  I think she wanted out a while ago.  And she was trying to figure out what this whole thing is.  That's good speculation.  I don't think, I really don't think they were having wild, crazy sex night after night.  I think it's all a bit.  I don't think it was a bit.  Just being a listener.  Yeah, I think there was certainly some sex going on early.  Yeah, yeah.  I really think all that went away. 
[02:43:00]  I really do.  You want to hear the noise I make when I kiss?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Do you believe that Charlie didn't do a drug or...  I do, actually.  I don't...  Yeah.  She said it.  She said no drugs or alcohol in her presence.  And she was around.  She didn't say it, so...  I have to pee my sweetie's bed.  Oh, make a wee-wee.  But more importantly, Anthony's fucking visual on... 
[02:43:30]  Being a cop that pulls her over.  Dude, when you see a car slid on ice and wrecked, and you pull up to the scene, and you're thinking  you're just going to see some Indiana fucking...  Some Bayshore bitch.  Farm bitch or something.  Right.  And then Brie Olsen's there with her ample breasts hanging out.  Just being heavy and...  Oh, oh.  And lofty at the same time.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  I just thought of something.  Maybe that's where the other six dash cam videos went. 
[02:44:00]  Yes.  No shit.  We all thought that.  Yeah.  It's like fucking...  Maybe she's got a light dusting of glittery airbag powder on her chest.  Just somewhere there's an unedited six-camera shoot porno starring Brie Olsen.  Brie Olsen and six police officers in...  Somewhere there's a...  I just don't remember.  Somewhere there's video of a cop that has like fucking donut powder on his face.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  From just going...  Just bronce skin in those tits. 
[02:44:30]  Getting some of that airbag dust on their face.  Fuck it.  Her stiletto heels just hiked up in the front seat, grabbing her ankles and just...  Pounding away.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  I'm on the dash cam?  Holy shit.  Yeah, I failed a lot of people today.  They wanted the boring clip.  They wanted the boo.  They wanted this and that.  But what are you going to do?  You know?  Maybe she'll...  You know what it is.  Maybe she'll talk eventually.  You got to...  It's like...  First of all, here's the deal also.  What I was thinking.  Who...  What else is there to fucking... 
[02:45:00]  That anyone wants to know?  I guess...  We all fucking know the story.  I guess it would be big news if she would have said that he is still on drugs.  Drugs, obviously.  So we asked that.  It would be big news if there really wasn't this crazy party scene at the house like the  media has reported.  Yeah.  That would have been big news for us.  What else?  I don't know.  I guess that's about it.  I guess those are the two big questions.  He walks around in a dress around the house.  Right.  Shit like that.  But you know, she's come on before. 
[02:45:30]  She's done great things for the show.  She's hot as fuck.  So, you know, we got to cut her some slack.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Every once in a while, we give someone a pass.  We gave someone a pass today.  And she...  What do you want from us?  She said she did say more shit than she said on other stuff.  I'm sure someone will pick something up on her.  All right.  Quick break.  And Nick DiPaolo next.  Stay there.  Nice.  It only gets better. 
[02:46:00]  We got Nick DiPaolo in studio.  Hi.  The big plug premiering on Showtime Saturday night at 9 p.m.  Nice.  Nick DiPaolo, raw nerve on Showtime this Saturday.  And then it's going to be on iTunes and Amazon?  Yeah.  So you can download that shit.  Yeah, on May 2nd, two days later, I think.  That's very exciting.  I believe.  And I'll be at the Pantages Theater on that night, Saturday night in Minneapolis.  Oh! 
[02:46:30]  The Pantages!  Yes!  I love that.  That's great.  Yeah.  Very cool.  I want to clear everything up, too, with the people, the listeners.  They all think I didn't go to see Nick DiPaolo at Governor's that night.  You didn't.  You said you didn't.  Oh, shut it, Jimmy.  All right.  How did this come about?  Because Nick tweeted something that you didn't show?  Yeah, because I always said something to somebody.  Yeah, I thought Anthony was coming.  That's all I said.  I didn't get ugly about it.  If it was like a zoo team in Oklahoma, I'd go, where's that fat prick?  That's true. 
[02:47:00]  AJ, what's his name?  The sidekick.  I didn't.  The thing is, I didn't go back.  Because usually if you come in, you go into the back and say hi or something.  But I just, who the fuck?  I don't blame you.  It's like governors.  Oh, come on.  Leave you alone.  Leave you to your own devices.  Leave me to talk to the middle act I don't like.  No, I don't blame you.  Trust me.  And I'm like, yeah, were you, did you want a date?  It was, yeah, me and my girl went.  We laughed our fucking asses off.  It was hysterical.  It was a good weekend.  Nick is great to see live. 
[02:47:30]  Anybody that tries to chime in with something cutesy gets their fucking head taken off.  And like, if they fire a pea shooter, Nick will come back with a howitzer.  It's brilliant.  It's called killing an ant with an axe.  It's true.  That's what my football coach used to say.  Yeah.  No, it was beautiful.  It was funny.  Great.  My favorite is in the cellar when the whole crowd is loving him.  And then he says something that really comedians would even grow it at.  Like, you know what I mean?  And they don't like it. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, like, I fucking hope Hillary Clinton's tits fall on.  One lady who's had a breast removed goes, oh, you have fucking liberal cunt.  That's exactly how that went down.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I do.  You know what?  But that place, the cellar does that to me.  I've been there so long, and I'm too comfortable.  It's like it's your living room.  Yeah.  I feel like you're invading mice, which is not the case.  They paid to get in.  That's why I don't get down there as much, you know. 
[02:48:30]  But it feels freeing when I'm on a stage, you know, like, you know, on the road somewhere.  Yeah.  And there's distance between me and the first row more than three inches.  You know what I mean?  And I'm much, you know, I'll let some shit slide, but the cellar does bring the fucking...  Brings the beast out.  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of rudeness there.  A lot of people talking.  That's right.  It's just every club because it's a small club, so you hear everything.  Is that what it is, that it's a small club?  And you hear everything, yeah.  Yeah.  When I went down there, there was people yapping and just like, shut the fuck up.  It's a good place to work out, though, because with all those distractions, if it works there, 
[02:49:00]  once you get it working there...  Yeah.  It's like my favorite line in New York, you can make it anywhere.  I sing that in the mirror, right before, like La Mata, when he was running for a party.  I don't get the cellar.  It's a great place, but the room just sucks for comedy.  I love the room.  The cellar?  No.  It's the fucking best.  That's how comedy was meant to be.  Because it's like, the back wall is like only 10 feet from it.  Yeah, it's a fucking box.  It's a weird design.  It seats like 200.  I love that.  It's gotten too popular. 
[02:49:30]  I mean, I say this obviously not from an owner's standpoint, but from a comedian's standpoint.  It used to be a great place.  Like, you get out in the middle of the week, and there'd be like 50 people.  It's perfect.  It'd be half empty or three quarters full, even.  And you could take out notes and take your time.  But now it's packed.  It's like a tourist trap.  Yeah.  And Louie shows it every week at the beginning of his show, and the word gets out.  People want to go.  Well, let's go to that club that's on the beginning of Louie's show that he goes down to in an episode.  Yeah.  So it's hard to, at least, I don't, like, I still try working on new shit, but it's harder 
[02:50:00]  when it's packed for some reason, because you have to stay on top of the crowd.  Yeah, if you're working on new shit and something doesn't work, they're just like,  eh, fucking ghost.  Well, you only have, yeah, 15 minutes, so, you know, if two of it sucks, they hold it against you.  You've got to go on after somebody killed, try working on, you know, Diana Ross on the  plane, bitch.  Oh, no.  Did that happen?  Oh, Jimmy.  Did that happen to me?  Did you try to concoct something humorous about that experience?  Just told the truth.  It actually usually works, but, I mean, a couple times it didn't. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  It really didn't work.  Like, and I know the energy is just dead when I'm talking, and I have no interest in it.  I know they couldn't.  I'm boring all of us at this point.  Diana Ross bit was a supreme bomb.  I'm, that's pretty funny.  I say, I hear a symphony or something, but it could be snores.  I've been trying to work on an Oprah story.  Yeah.  Down there for the last couple weeks, and just, you know, it's one night, it fucking rips  the tits off.  Did I do it at Governor's?  About the retarded kids?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  And it's killed.  It was one night, and then the next night, because, you know, when it's new, and it's kind  of a story, and not a setup, and a punchline.  But I insist, it's been months now, and I'm still going, this is going to work.  You insist on keep, just keep it going.  It'll work.  Can you give us the gist of that, or is that going to...  Well, I was, I talk about how politically, is there anything more politically correct  than Oprah, or the Oprah show?  I couldn't sleep one night.  I get up at three in the morning, I put it on, and she's telling a story.  I'm seeing, let's see how politically correct this horse shit is.  I put it on, and she's telling a story about her and Gayle King on vacation in Cape Cod. 
[02:51:30]  So the story starts with two black lesbians, that's politically correct right there.  They go on, they go, they own, in my opinion, they're lesbians, I don't know.  So they go on vacation in Cape Cod, and they go to this town where there's two white lesbians  who have a pie company.  How appropriate.  Exactly.  I'm going to put that into the joke, but actually, there's a dead spot right there,  I could use that.  And these broads look like Ted Kennedy in pantsuit, I mean, ugly and fucking, and they make pies, 
[02:52:00]  and somehow they get one of their chicken pies over to Oprah's hotel room, through security,  and Gayle King, Tace, and Oprah, and they go crazy.  Two black chicks going crazy over chicken pie, and a big shot.  So some guy down there that works at some company, they put the story in the paper,  because they went from selling 50 chicken pies to 200 a week.  They put the story in the local paper.  There's a guy down there that has a non-profit company,  he hires only retarded kids to shine nails and pick up acorns.  I don't know what the fuck they're doing.  What company does he run, Sirius XM? 
[02:52:30]  So he calls, he sees the story, he calls the pie company, two white lesbians.  So let's review, we get black lesbians, white lesbians.  And he says, can the kids work at the pie company?  Of course, they say yes.  So now you get black lesbians, white lesbians, retired kids making pies,  everybody's employed, everybody's happy.  That's a feel-good story.  That's a great feel-good story.  You order an apple pie, you get a twig cake.  That's what I said.  No, I'm happy for everybody, but do you want to eat pies made by retarded kids? 
[02:53:00]  It's Thanksgiving, you're like, I found a chinstrap in my cobbler.  I'm like, the fuck?  It's not to be mean, and I'm happy for everybody but me.  But it's just so, everything's so goody-two shit.  Yeah, yeah.  A chinstrap.  You're happy until you get the fucked up pies, is what you're saying.  It is the politically correct porch shit that we got a fucking deal with.  And Oprah has them on the show, the two white broads, right?  Oh, wow.  It hooks them up with Harry and David, some pie company, 
[02:53:30]  who have like a zillion email lists with a zillion people on it.  So now they're like making 100,000 pies a month, retarded kids.  And you know the retarded kids, they're not washing their hands.  No, they're not.  You know, Corky doesn't have Faisal Hex next to his workstation.  Fingers down the back of their pants, scratching their ass.  Yeah, then they're crimping the dough.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If a retarded kid's ass itches,  he's not going to think twice about fucking shoving his finger down there and scratching it.  Of course not.  Yes.  I'll have the blood and fingernail pie, please. 
[02:54:00]  That stupid old fixed.  Yes, I'll have the dumb bellows special.  It's a fucking pie.  They mail it in an envelope.  A big manila envelope with a crushed up pie in it.  I found a dirty diaper in my apple pie.  It's awful.  I'm happy in it.  It's a feel-good story, but I'm just...  It's not a feel-good story.  Thank you.  At this point in my life, I don't fucking need it.  No.  I've got enough compassion.  I'll have two blueberries and one blithering pie. 
[02:54:30]  Look at the ladies.  He's not kidding.  They're awful.  Wow.  They both look like fucking Lady Di.  I think you would be considered gay  if you had sex with them.  Yeah.  Exactly.  They don't look female at all.  I'm happy for them.  I'm sure they're nice ladies and they're doing great.  God bless you.  But I'm just fucking saying,  at this point in my life,  I don't need to hear that story.  The woman on the right looks like fucking Michael Anthony  from fucking Van Halen.  Fucking ugly basis.  Look at the delicious berry pie in front of her. 
[02:55:00]  Exactly.  It wasn't supposed to be an upside-down cake,  but you know how it goes.  Lemon moron.  All right.  I think that bit's fleshed out.  A lemon moron.  You might want to take notes, Nick.  You might want to take notes.  You don't have to.  Are you kidding me?  Now we work that bit out in public.  I can't do it anymore.  A lemon moron pie.  I'm using that in Minneapolis. 
[02:55:30]  That is fucking hilarious.  Quick, other pies.  What?  How about a strawberry tart?  It's a shoe fly pie.  It really has a shoe in it.  They are stupid.  Yeah, they sure are.  Jesus, one blunder after another.  It's nothing but a comedy of errors over there.  What happened?  We have to close down.  Stupid's got his face in the oven again. 
[02:56:00]  He thinks it's an uncomfortable bed.  That's not a pillow, you idiot.  It's hot.  Stop napping on the fucking Bunsen burner,  even though there isn't one in a fucking thing.  I just couldn't think of another hot thing.  Are you sure the number?  I'm calling.  Are you sure the number's right?  Yep.  Yeah, that's the face.  Yes.  I didn't notice an extra chromosome in my brain.  It's funny. 
[02:56:30]  You order a pie,  a guy just shows up crying at your front door  with a bleeding child in his hand.  Punching it.  Chin scrapping my cobbler.  Wow.  I just want to take home with you today.  Holy shit, Dick.  Let me try the thumbprint pie.  Is that what you're going to be?  Daddy's pies is so bad  because the guy's making them  got like no brains or nothing.  That's good shit.  Thanks.  I'm happy for everybody in that story.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:57:00]  It sounds good.  At this point in my life,  I don't fucking need it.  And I'm sure everybody in the audience  is smiling and clapping like,  aww.  That's a good story.  One night it'll be people jaded like me  who are like,  yeah, you're right.  Oof.  We're tired of the fuck compassion.  Sick of it.  And then the next night it'll be people,  oh, that is a good story.  Yeah, yeah.  Why is he making fun of that?  Why is that funny?  We should ask Nick about the Roger McDowell thing.  That's what we were wearing before the Brie Olsen thing.  Oh, fucking. 
[02:57:30]  It's more of a language thing  and PC shit and all that crap.  A couple of people in the bleachers were...  And one of your favorites is on this case,  Gloria Allred.  A couple of people in the bleachers  were giving, I guess,  giving him some shit.  And he said something  that was described as a homophobic statement.  Not even a slur or something.  I don't even know what it was.  Well, I got the audio,  so let's listen to the audio.  That's quick.  He's a...  I didn't even know the batting practice  or some shit.  He used to pitch for the Mets 
[02:58:00]  and now he's the Atlanta Braves pitching coach.  Now he's a life partner coach.  Yeah, so he's on the field  during batting practice  getting ready for a game  and some shit went down.  Mr. Quinn was in the bleachers  with his children at batting practice  when he and his family...  Don't fucking call me names right here.  You're going to call me a faggot?  I'm a...  Turn off.  Emily observed Atlanta Braves coach  Roger McDowell  making some extremely rude  and homophobic comments  to three men 
[02:58:30]  who were also in the bleachers.  So?  Mr. Quinn heard Coach McDowell  say to these men,  quote,  are you guys a homo couple  or a threesome?  End quote.  Oh my God!  Jesus!  Whoa!  Didn't even say fag  or anything like that,  a queer...  There's something going on  and I'm fucking tired of it.  And we have gay friends.  I'm in show business for Christ's sake.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  As many gay friends  as Kelly Ripa does.  It's got nothing to do  with you being gay,  but it's about these groups and shit.  You're getting a little  too protective of yourselves. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Get the fuck over yourselves,  okay?  You fucking faggot.  Assimilate to society  and just be part  of fucking society.  That's...  I mean, come on.  Every time something happens,  everyone wants to be accepted  in society,  but the second you're accepted  like everyone else is  and someone makes a joke about you,  instead of leaving it alone,  all of a sudden,  now you want to be separate again.  Yeah, you don't want to be  accepted anymore.  And not be part of society.  You want to be separate  and fucking make society pay  for the love of having  a dick in your ass.  Society?  Why would she take this case?  Because she sucks.  No, we all know she sucks. 
[02:59:30]  Who took it?  I'm guessing...  Gloria Allred.  I bet you there's a lawsuit.  It gets better.  Oh yeah, because there's a lawsuit.  Then the coach allegedly  grabbed a baseball bat  and started shoving  the small end  through a circle  formed by his finger  and thumb.  Simple.  Wow.  Why didn't he use a donut?  In other words,  any male heterosexual  fooling around  is not allowed anymore.  Right, right.  None of that shit.  The three guys, by the way,  were probably laughing  their fucking balls off  at this point.  Of course they were.  They're like,  that's the bat we used  last night.  And the reaction we had, 
[03:00:00]  why was there one guy  at the press conference  having that reaction?  That's just fucking funny.  It's hysterical.  Through a circle  formed by his finger  and thumb  simulating sex.  Well, that's how you do it.  The coach then  allegedly said,  are you three  giving it to each other  up the...  What's the word?  Up the what?  What's the word?  Up the chimney?  Is it cunt?  Up the British.  What?  Up the Academy?  The Mad Magazine movie?  Right.  I like to think  it was Bung Hall.  Up the Bung Hall.  Up the Bung Hall. 
[03:00:30]  Can you imagine?  This is like...  Seriously.  You're reprimanding  grown men  like in second grade.  Right.  Did you say that?  At a ballpark.  At a ballpark.  They're fucking adult  ballplayers  with adults in the stands  having a little  back and forth exchange  like any guy  would have  with somebody  that's fucking with you.  They don't want that.  They want to take  testosterone right  out of the picture, guys.  Exactly.  I've been saying it  for years.  Exactly.  There's something else  going on here.  The three guys  Roger McDowell  was going after  I think  didn't have much  of a problem with this. 
[03:01:00]  No, they're not  the one with the problem.  Yeah.  Wait.  The story gets better, Nick.  You know,  they obviously said  something to Roger.  Roger's like,  oh yeah,  you're fucking homos  and doing this and that.  And they probably laughed.  And I think the guys  took it like,  okay, it's just guys  doing what we do, right?  It was someone behind them.  But there was someone else  that saw this whole shit go down.  Can I just say,  was that someone,  a man or a woman?  I think it was  a little family,  but I'm sure the man  wasn't the one  that got all upset.  A whole family?  Let's find out.  Let's find out.  Gather up the,  let me use the word for,  crude word for.  Just say ass. 
[03:01:30]  I know.  There you go.  While thrusting his hips  forward and backward  in a sexual manner.  This guy is the rule.  Roger McDowell.  I fucking love  Roger McDowell.  He is hysterical.  I didn't realize  he was such an asshole.  He's losing me.  Why?  He's going too far.  Well,  devil's advocate,  but if you're the manager  of a professional baseball team.  He's not though.  He's just a coach.  Okay,  you work for the Braves  and there's people  in the stands  and you're fucking going,  hey,  do you fuck each other  in the ass 
[03:02:00]  and putting a bat  through your finger  and humping?  That's hilarious.  It is.  It's a ballpark.  He's on a ball field.  It's a ballpark.  Anything goes.  You're right.  Jimmy,  can I tell you something  now that I'm a father?  I would have no fucking problem  with that  if I was with my son.  I would have no problem  with that.  I would explain it to him.  That's behavior I'd expect  from a third base coach.  Yeah,  exactly.  Is he the manager?  I'm not a manager.  Why is someone so offended  that you've got to get  Gloria Allred involved?  I would have no problem  with that.  I would explain the shit. 
[03:02:30]  It's an easy way  to get out of it.  You say,  these are new signals.  Yeah,  exactly.  That's steel.  This is bunt.  And this is shit  on the end of my cock.  And backward  in a sexual manner.  You're a sexual man.  Coach McDowell  then put up three fingers  three fingers  pointing at the men  and in response  some individuals  in the bleacher  shouted,  oh my God.  Okay.  And that should be  the end of it.  Oh my God.  Do you think  anyone really went  oh my God 
[03:03:00]  or like  oh my God.  That's hysterical.  Exactly.  It's not home.  Exactly.  Oh,  I'm in a ballpark.  You wouldn't expect  this behavior.  If that goes down  most people  are laughing their asses off.  Of course.  But it's not about  the majority anymore.  Yeah,  this is where we are.  This is where we're headed.  It's never about  the majority.  They say oh my God  when she comes in the room  but it's always followed  by the ct is here.  She is a fucking  joyless monster.  I really hate  I hope her clit  gets caught in like a  I don't know how a clit 
[03:03:30]  would get caught  in a fucking bike chain.  Very easy with her.  Yeah.  I hope she's fucking  changing a bike tire  and hangs down  like Turkish taffy.  This is just  we're doomed  as a nation  especially as a nation  of men.  We're just doomed.  It's PC horse shit.  Don't come from the right  and it never did.  No.  I'm fucking saying that  till I'm a thousand.  You're not going to  live that long.  I don't know.  I did ten sit-ups 
[03:04:00]  this morning.  We got one more  short clip.  Let's wrap this up.  Do I look thinner?  Thanks, Dan.  Well, it's the black  you're wearing.  But you don't.  It's thinning.  I'm eating like a  fucking...  I don't give a fuck.  I like when people  say nice things to me.  At that point,  Justin shouted,  hey, there are kids  out here.  Oh, Justin.  Hey.  Where is this paradise?  Everybody's butt-fucking.  There's children watching.  He's got the donut.  Oh, she's making me 
[03:04:30]  want to go to this place.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, you make the little  finger through the whole  thing.  You show them.  That's how you make  the big boys happy.  Holy shit.  So I guess Justin's  the problem?  Justin was the father  with the kid probably,  right?  Yeah.  At that point,  Justin shouted,  hey, there are kids  out here.  The coach replied,  kids don't effing  belong at the  baseball park.  I think Roger's  had it with baseball.  No, he's begging  just fucking take me off.  No, he's had it with 
[03:05:00]  fucking women and  children.  Exactly.  Being the fucking  default button in  this country.  The fucking world  doesn't revolve around  you and your fucking  kids.  I don't give a fuck.  And Nick, going with  that, I think what he's  saying is something we  have said on this show.  You go to these  sporting events and  now it's all about the  children.  Yeah, I know.  They get rid of all the  stuff that adults enjoy  at a sporting event  because it might offend  the child.  You understand that's  female think.  Yes.  Okay, the more empowered  women have become in  this society, I'm going  to say it again and 
[03:05:30]  again, the more, that's  how we're starting to  think.  Yeah.  Oversensitivity doesn't  come from a male point  of view.  No.  You know what I'm  saying?  That's a mothering thing  that would happen in a  ballpark, not a dad.  I remember going to the  fucking ballpark of my  dad and all I heard was  cursing out of him.  He was the one.  And you're on the  pitchers and I'm crying.  Yeah.  His father was Vic  Morrow and then he  slapped him on the stand.  Then Tanner Boyle  fucked his mouth in the  tree fort.  Good example.  You mean the guy who 
[03:06:00]  threw spaghetti against the  wall?  Yeah.  The C word?  I just remember hearing  like other people yelling  and cursing and as a kid  even finding it hilarious.  Yeah.  And it was like cool as a  kid.  You're just like, oh my  God, I've never heard so  many cursors in my life.  It's great.  It's called growing up.  You can't make the  fucking world childproof and  risk proof.  You're right.  What the fuck?  Everything's got to be  fucking put in bubble wrap  and all the sockets got to  have the plug things  standing in.  And I mean that in a kind 
[03:06:30]  of generalized term, not  literally.  I think you should probably,  you know, if you got kids,  keep the old sockets full.  I can tell you.  I can tell you.  That's not that way.  Uncle Paul.  That is scary.  Keep the sockets full.  But it's just it.  We're fucking a bunch of  sock pussies.  Well, here we go.  Let's kowtow to them.  Well, yeah, guys give it.  We've given into it.  So it's our fault.  We got 30 more seconds  and I'll just enrich you  even further.  It's fall park.  End quote.  The coach then picked up  his bat and started walking 
[03:07:00]  in a threatening manner  towards Mr. Quinn,  saying to him, quote,  how much are your teeth  worth?  End quote.  It's the greatest guy ever.  Actions that we think  are appropriate are that  both Coach McDowell  and the team should be  fined and Coach McDowell  should be ordered to  apologize to Mr. Quinn  and his family and to all  the fans and to the city  of San Francisco  for his homophobic,  vulgar and threatening  behavior.  Finally, we also believe 
[03:07:30]  that Coach McDowell  should be required to  undergo sensitivity  training.  There it is, guys.  She just knows every hot  button.  It's almost like she's  laying it on.  Wink, wink.  Yeah, yeah.  Can she be serious at this  point?  Really?  That can't be serious.  Why don't you go  desensitivity training for  you?  Yeah, don't be so  sensitive.  Seriously, put her in a  fucking...  Apologize to what amounts  to an entire city.  Well, you heard in there.  It was an away game.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course that's how you 
[03:08:00]  treat the fucking...  The fucking home team  from fucking Cisco.  Was it a major league  ballpark or was it  triple-A?  Major league, I think.  Was it?  Roger McDowell,  McDowell, excuse me.  Yep, he had to apologize.  The fake apology.  But he is acting...  You got to say this.  It just kept getting worse.  It wasn't like he just  said, hey, you three  homos.  He did the hip thing  and he mimicked the bats  and he said, fuck in the  ass and he said,  I'll knock the teeth out.  But you know what?  We're not getting the  whole story of what they  were yelling at him  either. 
[03:08:30]  I'm sure it was all  to set him up.  Where's his lawyer?  Pushed him over the  fucking...  Yeah.  They're probably yelling  something like,  no batter, no batter,  swing.  I yell that a lot.  Now we get to the...  At football games.  Why would they yell  that at the pitching  coach?  Exactly.  That's the beauty of it.  It's wrong.  Because he's not a batter  and he gets confused.  This story has all the  features because now  this is something that  drives us nuts too.  So they force him to  apologize.  He apologizes for the  gay slurs and all that,  right?  Yeah.  But advocates,  including Glad,  want Major League Baseball 
[03:09:00]  on the team to take  more action.  If you apologize,  shouldn't that just be  it sometimes?  No, more action.  It's not enough for Glad.  So you have to apologize  and also fucking lose  your livelihood.  I'm fired.  So why apologize then?  Where does Glad,  where's the headquarters,  and why doesn't somebody  burn it down tonight?  I'll give you $50.  Nick is kidding,  completely kidding.  I'm only kidding.  Nick is joking.  Not real fire.  No.  That's what Nick does.  Nick is completely joking.  Nick's a comedian.  Of course.  They don't have a  headquarters.  Jesus, no.  The apology.  Behind quarters. 
[03:09:30]  I'm deeply sorry.  That responded to the  heckling fans in San  Francisco on Saturday.  So they were heckling  him pretty good and he  finally had it.  I apologize to  everyone for my  actions.  Let's gloss over that  part of the fucking  fight where he was  getting heckled.  That's not important.  What a load of shit.  And here's the shit.  It goes, McDowell's  apology is a start.  Yeah.  Why does it have to  just be a start?  Because he needs that  sensitivity training.  But the Braves and  Major League Baseball  must take real  disciplinary action and  send the message that  anti-gay slurs have no 
[03:10:00]  place in sports.  And after they do that  they better change a  name from the Braves  because that's also  offensive to Native  Americans who take  it in the ass.  That's true.  They do the tomahawk  chip.  What's that?  What?  Professional sporting  events should be an  environment that all  fans and families can  enjoy.  But adult males are not  enjoying it because it's  way too family friendly.  Now it's family friendly.  So where's our  enjoyment?  Not a place where  children are exposed to  violent threats and  discriminatory language.  Shut up.  Again, would that ever  come from a guy? 
[03:10:30]  All the legends.  Do you think Ted  Williams didn't yell  some shit out?  Babe Ruth.  Babe Ruth.  Rod Carew.  Oh, Joe DiMaggio.  Babe Ruth would have  been on the on deck  circle actually putting  Pine Tower and a  stick in the bat in his  ass to make his point.  He would have been like,  well, he's eating a  hot dog filled with  trans.  You like this, right?  You like this shit,  don't you?  Well, he's smoking a  cigar and he's trans  fats.  He's eating like a  hundred hot dogs for a  home run with the same  fucking bat.  And then Joe DiMaggio  would have blackened his  wife's eye and went off 
[03:11:00]  to war.  I'm just listing things  now.  Let's not forget, let's  not forget Ty Cobb.  He knew how to handle  himself.  When people ask me  about the mud drug  comedy fuzz, I go,  well, how do you  describe your act?  I go, I'm like Ty  Cobb without the  baseball skills.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, I thought that  summed it up.  He was great,  wasn't he?  Fucking great.  I don't like the  violence I'm seeing  here.  What do you think  he's saying?  Let me see.  Yeah, exactly.  Hi, how are you?  One of my favorite  things is when they 
[03:11:30]  get real tight on a  pitcher's face after he  gives up a home run.  And you just see him  clear his head, just  go, shit.  Fuck.  Motherfucker, yeah.  Is that Roger  McCall?  They don't bother  covering their mobs  anymore.  I love when they  cover up the  home plate manager.  Cover the play  with their  going completely  apeshit.  That is a crazy  insult.  That's hilarious.  Doesn't he throw  the grenade to this  guy?  Is this the guy that  crawls on his  stomach?  That was a  minor league guy.  That's him.  Now he's marking  out what home plate  is.  He's making a real  scene. 
[03:12:00]  Fuck you.  He really is being  there's a lot of  fuck you's.  He's going to get  the guy.  It looks like he  should be running a  drill press.  He picks up third  base.  He's walking away  with it.  What the fuck?  I wonder what the  story is behind  this.  He probably thinks  they're big stamps.  He's taking the  bases.  He wants to mail a  letter to the  fucking pie company.  It's going to be  Anthony.  What's this?  Oh yeah.  What's this?  If he had a real 
[03:12:30]  gumption, it's shit  on the mound.  Look at this.  He's low crawling.  He's soldier low  crawling onto the  pitcher's mound.  You're going to love  this.  He's picking up the  rosin bag.  He's throwing it like  a grenade at the  ump.  That was a good  shot.  When was this?  Quite a few years  ago.  Did he get in  trouble for that?  He probably got a  sitcom.  Phil Wellman.  That was posted back  in 07.  That's great.  He's done a one man  show on Broadway.  God damn is that 
[03:13:00]  funny.  Yeah, Jimmy, I guess  he went a little  too far, but still  to ask for his job  at this point is  ridiculous.  Oh, they asked  him for his job  though?  No, I haven't  heard anyone say  they're on fire.  That's what they're  hinting at.  Disciplinary actions?  What does that  fucking mean?  They want him out.  Maybe they want  him to suck off  the guys he yelled  at.  Suck them off.  Roger McDowell's my  new favorite  fucking ex-player.  This guy then is  just taking the  other players laughing.  He just took  second and third  and then does the  big kiss and  goodnight.  He's leaving  through the outfield.  Two-hand kiss and  see ya. 
[03:13:30]  That guy's in Dutch.  That's it.  Did he get fired  for that?  I hope he got  rewarded.  It looked like an  old clip, so they  probably just...  I think he did.  One game  suspension.  When was the last  time you heard of  Phil Wellman?  I rest my case.  That's true.  I like to say  end all sentences  like that.  I rest my case,  gentlemen.  Good old Phil  Wellman.  That's very good.  Thank you.  I bet you  Mr. McDowell  had a few in  him.  Probably did.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, a couple  in him.  You don't know  what happened.  He had a fight  with his wife.  These fucking  assholes yelling  at me.  Fucking fag. 
[03:14:00]  Fucking tell  them.  Tell you,  homos.  Yeah, fucking  like the bat.  You fucking  take it.  You guys want  a small update  on Philip  Wellman?  Yeah, what  happened?  Who was that  guy?  Well, in 2009,  ESPN showed the  top ten meltdowns  in sports history  and judged that  one to be  number one.  Number one.  Nice.  Well deserved.  That's a good one.  Let's see.  He was also brought  up to the Major  League Braves  for a couple  of weeks  in March of  2009.  After he entered  number four.  After. 
[03:14:30]  And then after  the Minor League  Braves finished  the 2010 season  with a 63-74  record,  Wellman's contract  was not renewed.  What happened  right after that  incident,  does it say?  He was given  a three-game  suspension.  Oh, that's it?  And what year  was that incident?  That was 2007.  And that was  AAA or something.  That wasn't  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That wasn't  the show.  I didn't think  it was triple.  I might go  double on that one.  You might be right,  Ope.  I might go double  on that one.  You might be right.  There was a little  too many advertisements  on the outfield walls. 
[03:15:00]  I love that guy.  Fuck.  I'm so sick of this.  Where's the  Mississippi Braves?  Anybody know?  Oh, is that it?  Mississippi Braves.  M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.  Double A.  Topeka, Kansas.  I spell Mississippi  very well.  Yeah, yeah, you do.  Very fast.  Whew.  Jesus.  I actually use that  to try to get pussy.  You know the only  one that can't spell.  Yes.  The girl's like,  I'm not attracted to you.  M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.  Oh, double, double, double,  double, double.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:15:30]  You don't doubt it.  You know,  I'm sick of it.  I'm fucking tired of it.  You know 128 people  die in Alabama today?  Yeah, it's crazy.  What the fuck's going on?  Tornadoes.  Giant fucking monstrous  movie tornadoes.  Why don't we get them up here?  It's all that whole thing.  It's just set up perfectly.  It's the Rocky Mountains.  Topography.  Is that what it is?  And then the Great Plains.  And for some reason  we don't get them here.  Well, we got a touch.  Remember last year  we had a couple touchdowns  in Yonkers?  Yeah, yeah.  Remember?  Could you imagine  they got to always send somebody 
[03:16:00]  from the Weather Channel  to go,  well, we're going to investigate  and see if this was  a real tornado.  But we never get one of those  mile-wide fucking  those things that look like  they're spinning slow  but they're doing  400 miles an hour.  We don't get those.  Is that how fast  that shit spins?  Oh, at least.  Wow.  Motherfucker.  I have to pee  but before I pee  I'm afraid I'm going to  come back to no show  so I have to plug something  before I forget.  Why would you think that, Jim?  Oh, I don't know.  I can't pee in less than 35 seconds.  Oh, boy.  I'll block my shit too, will you, Jim? 
[03:16:30]  The Anti-Social Network  is coming to Seattle  Friday, July 1st.  Where's Uncle Social?  Because it's anti-like  in anti-freezes.  I don't know.  It's with myself  and Burr  and Brewer and Attel  and it's the Paramount  Theater July 1st.  Tickets are on sale tomorrow  but today there's a pre-sale.  Go to www.tickets.com  and the word  this is the password  K-I-S-W  It's on 10 o'clock 
[03:17:00]  a.m. to 10 p.m.  on the West Coast  and that's because  it's the station call letters  for BJ Shea.  Yeah, BJ's supporting the show.  Yeah, and the show will sell out  because it's a big show for BJ's.  Are we going to have him on tomorrow?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  I think I have to call in.  I like my time with BJ.  He's still out there.  I love BJ Shea.  Yeah, BJ's alright.  Alright, get out of here, Jim.  We won't continue  with Nick DiPaolo here  who's got a great  showtime special.  You have to take a leak.  When's your special?  Saturday.  Saturday night.  How'd you get that?  They look up at people?  Raw nerve.  What do you discuss 
[03:17:30]  on the special?  All the hot topics?  All the hot buttons?  I was talking about  this Alabama storm  a year before it happened.  This is how good I am.  You're a seer.  It's my, you know,  I'll take a few swipes  at Obama  and it's, you know,  I shit on myself  and my wife  and getting old  and marriage  and politically,  you know,  it'll be refreshing.  Yeah, it is refreshing.  It's refreshing to  actually hear somebody  talk like Nick does  because it's the 
[03:18:00]  political correctness  is nauseating out there.  Nauseating.  Yeah.  And then when Nick's  on stage  and says some shit  and you hear the crowd  sometimes they do gasp,  I'm fucking roaring  going like,  thank God.  Thank God.  Once,  I keep waiting  to hear a shot though  and watch you  hit the stage  like somebody  just blow your fucking head off.  Oh, don't give me any ideas.  Oh, I know.  Believe me.  I think that every day  I walk out of this fucking place  too.  Especially,  yeah,  Showtime,  9 o'clock  this Saturday night 
[03:18:30]  and I'll be at the  Pantages Theater  while the Showtime special's on  in Minneapolis.  Yes.  It's a beautiful theater  and I heard it's pretty full.  Yeah,  very good.  So,  come out and see Nick,  that's for sure.  But yeah,  tune it to show,  and if you don't have it,  just order it and cancel it.  That's all you got.  I don't give a fuck.  Just order it.  Order it and cancel it.  If you don't have it,  wrap your mother in tinfoil  and put her tits  due north on the roof  and pick up bits and pieces.  But it came out good.  I shot it at Foxwoods  and yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, good for you.  It's overdoin' my opinion.  Good for you.  It's not suckers.  It's about fucking time, right?  Yeah, really.  Backsuckers.  Yeah, 23 years in.  Should have had six of these  under my belt.  There's no justice.  Nah.  No justice.  There'll be no peace.  No justice, no peace.  Right, we get it.  Well, we did the Roger McDowell.  That's a great story, man.  Anytime Gloria Allred's involved,  you know.  I hate her.  Touches my nerve.  I got the yell at her personally.  Really?  Yeah, it was on Joy Behar.  She was on like remote. 
[03:19:30]  She kept calling women  second class.  I go, second class?  All we did was take you to dinner  and buy you drinks  your whole fucking life.  But second class,  she actually smirked at that.  She started like smiling.  Yeah, she did.  Good for you.  Breaking through that horse shit.  I'm trying to.  Not a car.  Bullshit.  What else?  The royal wedding.  What else?  How about a fucking Escalade  doing 65, 70 miles an hour?  I'm trying to give Nick  a little more time.  What?  I'm trying to give Nick  a little fucking time. 
[03:20:00]  Anthony's been doing radio  for 40 years.  I feel like I got tuberculosis here.  I'm coughing and sneezing.  It's hurting today.  All right, then we can wrap.  We are live till 11  if you want to stick around.  Are you really?  It's just different people in here.  Oh, crap.  They're kind of associated  with the show.  What do you mean?  They bring in the B team.  They bring in some of these kids  to do a show.  But you won't be it, Amy?  No.  Sometimes.  And they talk about shit.  It goes on now.  Sometimes we're here.  Sometimes we're here.  Here he comes.  It's Sam Roberts. 
[03:20:30]  He does the show.  It's called the shit hour.  Yeah, we call it the...  Oh, hi, Sam.  There he is.  We were talking about the shit hour.  The kid with the fucking hair  you don't usually see  below 125th Street.  People are asking  about your DNA test.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Don't we have the results?  What are you asking me for?  Like, I know this is  a secret investigation.  I thought we were supposed  to have it weeks ago.  But I'm not part of it.  We're trying to figure out  if he's black.  We DNA tested him  and sent it out  and had it returned  to see if he's not black in him.  If he has black blood in him.  I'd say, yeah.  Yeah, there's something there.  He says his family's...  That fucking hair  is not because of the humidity.  Come on. 
[03:21:00]  Come on.  It's humidity in the Congo, maybe.  Look at the...  It's like, you know...  It's like Queen Latifah's shrub.  He was related to...  No, uh...  Thomas Jefferson.  TJ.  Thomas Jefferson.  He raised the family roots back.  And you know what  Jefferson was doing.  He was out there  banging like a motherfucker.  Oh, absolutely.  Banging the slaves.  It wasn't just about  the corn and the fields.  No, that's for sure.  When you go to the annual picnic,  which side of the field  are you on?  I don't go to any...  Do you go to the...  Which side?  Because they do.  They have the 
[03:21:30]  Thomas Jefferson family reunion,  which used to be  a big event with...  And then they started  allowing the other side  of the family in.  But they allow them  on the other side of the field.  It was a big motherfucking  cookout, y'all.  Big cookout.  You know how miserable  those old white people  must have been?  Hated it.  To see...  Because it must have been  like a big...  Well, again,  we meet for Thomas Jefferson's...  Our whole family  is back together.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we is.  Part of family too now,  motherfucker.  Back to checking 
[03:22:00]  the family tree  or just Thurgood Marshall  or something.  We would all get along  at the family picnic  slash cookout.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, you think?  Yeah.  Have you ever been to one?  No.  Have you been to a cookout?  Would you be invited?  You strapped yo?  You'll be strapped  at a cookout.  Until you ask your black  niece to get you  a can of Coke  and she fucking  gets enraged.  Get my ribs on.  What is this?  1862?  You get it yourself.  Come on. 
[03:22:30]  Get a plate.  Get on that.  Get on that.  Get on that.  What?  I'm eating.  Get on that.  Oh, fuck.  The world's ending  and we didn't even  give a shit enough  to fucking play.  Is that today?  What is it?  May 21st?  Oh, May 21st.  The world ends.  We got tomorrow.  I fucking paid my bills.  Shit.  I didn't have to pay my bills.  No way.  Guess I won't be  doing that gig.  Yeah.  Tomorrow on the 25th.  Oh, shit.  And I booked Red Eye, too.  So did I.  Wait, I think I'm on Red Eye  on the 21st and the 25th. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, that's going to be  a good one, though.  Uh-oh.  Is that the end  of the world day?  Shit, yo.  Well, I don't know  what time it is.  What better people  to fucking perish with?  Yeah.  Greg Gutfeld.  Absolutely.  Bill Schultz.  Andy Levy.  And some fucking  chick with nice gams.  Yeah.  Crystal Ball.  That's who I was on  with last.  I was on with Jedediah.  Jedediah.  She's got nice legs on her.  They all do.  It's amazing.  They put him in the leg seat.  Yeah.  Some of them got nice legs. 
[03:23:30]  His name's Michael,  like yours.  People saw Q&A.  All right.  We gave Nick  this extra time now.  All right.  It's time to go.  Is this all about me?  Oh, come on now.  We would have been out of here.  We're just showing you respect.  Five minutes over.  I still got to pack my computer.  And you know what's sad?  I have to stick around  because I'm doing  the little, you know,  the serious thing.  I have like three or four shows  to do until like two o'clock.  All right.  Well, we'll promote  the fucking gay channel.  I did that one.  How was that?  A couple of years ago.  Yeah.  I had a ball in there.  Yeah.  I bet two balls probably. 
[03:24:00]  Do they like you?  Yes.  Oh, four of those.  Yeah.  You guys, sorry.  That was just being me.  Did you soften your delivery  a little bit?  No, I said, listen,  cocksuckers,  give me some coffee  and let's talk about  the weather.  No, no, no.  They're actually very good.  We are.  Gay people  I don't have  a problem with.  Just so when they get in groups  and start fucking whining  like a lad, you know.  And start typing shit out  and sending up press releases.  Yeah, that type.  Yeah.  Come on.  We all get bullied. 
[03:24:30]  Get the fuck over.  I'm sick of hearing that, too.  We've gotten to the point  where we don't mind  if they're in the men's room  with us, so.  I feel like I'm grown as a person.  I actually back off  and show off.  Yeah, I used to back off  and wait and stuff.  But now it's like,  all right, I think I can do this.  I think I could fucking piss  next to a gay guy now.  I let my cock get weighty.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  When there's a gay guy  pissing next to me  at the urinal next to me,  I turn around  and I take a dump  right in my urinal  just to show him  that I'm not afraid of anything.  It's enticing.  Well, we got metal walls  in our men's room.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:25:00]  Does it smell like  a dead monkey in there still?  It's terrible.  Oh, no, that was the other building.  The other building was hard.  Let's think of the other building.  Oh, that was terrible.  This one, too?  This fucking bathroom,  we've talked about it.  Might be you guys.  We don't know what happens  when we're not here overnight.  Animals don't flush.  It's ridiculous.  It looks like  a Port Authority bathroom  or something.  What's wrong with these people?  There's no reason  to walk into a stall,  open the door  and just see a big load of shit  with toilet paper on it.  Just fucking poke it.  Well, how angry are you  that the shit is on  the actual seat?  That's another thing.  Jesus Christ, 
[03:25:30]  I just got queasy  to that story.  It's awful.  We've seen this.  When you leave the stall  on the fucking toilet.  See, now that's what  Gloria Allred  should be going after.  Right.  That type of behavior.  People leaving shit in the bowl.  Yeah, go after that.  Make that your cause.  I think everybody  will get behind that one.  Pee on the seat,  pee on the floor.  Somebody wants a chocolate frappe.  Frappe, boogers on the walls.  Oh, I know.  Oh, the boogers on the walls.  Fucking animals.  Yeah, that happened  when I used to work  at Free FM.  Somebody kept, like,  and they were fresh.  What kind of fucking  mental illness is that? 
[03:26:00]  They would have tasted  like a cold if you ate it.  There's toilet paper  right next to you.  That was Tom Chiasano.  He was guilty.  Oh, he'd do that.  Yeah, he was guilty  of putting his snot everywhere  to show who's boss.  It was weird, man.  It was somebody's sensation.  It is weird.  Raw Nerve premiering  on Showtime Saturday night,  9 p.m.  Congratulations on that, sir.  Thanks, Al.  Nick DiPaolo on Twitter,  nickdip.com,  and the gig in Minnesota.  Yeah, Pantages Theater  this Saturday night.  That's awesome.  7 o'clock Minneapolis time.  It's just fucking business.  You think this chick is hot? 
[03:26:30]  Big load.  That wasn't yours, right?  Of course it was.  Get out of here.  Who else does shit  what I have on my phone?  Yeah, really?  What, are you kidding me?  You can download anything today.  He got a pre-toilet paper.  What, are you working  at Dairy Queen?  There was a scoop  of fucking cream on that.  Holy shit.  It looked like a cobra  from Africa.  Well, you know,  if I played a flute  and fly on it,  I'd then come out  of the toilet  and kiss me on the nose.  What, do you mean  like that one?  That's not yours either.  It is so.  I'm the question mark here. 
[03:27:00]  That's a dog's tail,  isn't it?  What'd you do,  flush a German shepherd  down the top?  Let me see if I can.  Share with everyone, Jim.  Let me see if I can.  Let me see if I can.  Yeah.  Let's, uh...  No, I don't have it on the...  It's in the shape  of his intestine.  It was, yeah.  What are you eating?  What's that?  What is that one?  Let me see.  I have very good duties.  That's a perfect person.  Yeah, I think Sean Connery  is actually piloting that one.  For Christ's sake.  I have good shits.  I wouldn't even use your phone now 
[03:27:30]  to put that phone to my ear.  Yes.  Because you know  he took pick and put the...  Right in there.  Got the clothes on.  I'm making fun of Rotatica  because he's making pies.  He's making little muffins.  That's my own comment.  And I licked that out of my hand  on a video.  What the fuck is wrong with him?  We've been trying  to figure it out, Nick.  And nobody reprimands him  for this type of shit.  A girl asked me to do it  so I did it.  If you got, you know,  a clue, help us out.  Oh yeah.  A girl wanted to watch me  lick my comment.  I did.  There you go.  It was very dirty.  And is your sister still around? 
[03:28:00]  No.  She would never ask that.  Anything else, Nick?  Yeah.  Now that I'm sick to my stomach?  Jesus.  You guys even gross me out.  Why?  Why?  That's not a good one.  What is that?  That's not shit.  I see, Joe.  That's a sloppy joke.  Are you starting to use props now?  Oh God.  Jimmy's using props in his toilet.  I'm worried.  What are you fucking serious?  A couple of heavy piles of shit.  You might want to get that checked out.  No, but I'm getting worried about me 
[03:28:30]  because my shits are like  a half inch in diameter.  My shits are fucking...  I take a man's shits.  A man?  A 600 pound man?  Jesus Christ.  I've never seen anything like that.  The fact that he has so many pictures.  Please, I deleted a lot.  I missed those.  You should put...  Do you ever put those in frames  and hang them in your living room?  And just have company over?  That's fine art.  Don't say anything.  You have a chick over?  That's hilarious.  Funny you should ask, Nick.  I used to take Polaroids in my logs  and I took two Polaroids  and I had them on my fucking dresser 
[03:29:00]  when I looked at my parents.  And my ex-girlfriend  and her female cousin came over  and I forgot I had the pictures on them.  So we walked in my room  and they're like,  what are these?  I know it.  And they both saw my shit pictures.  I was so embarrassed.  What did you tell them?  It's a covered bridge in Vermont.  Yeah, I was like,  ah, it's just a thing I did.  Forget it.  It's a dumb thing I did.  The bridges of Madison County.  I tried to fuck one.  It didn't work.  Holy shit, man.  It's like a scene in Ghost.  He's got his hands in it  and his boyfriend's behind him. 
[03:29:30]  He's shaping it.  I'm worried about my colon health.  Seriously, if that's how my shit's  supposed to be that, you know.  I don't know.  Shit's supposed to be thin, man.  Shit is very diverse.  I don't think it's supposed to be thin.  Yeah.  No, I know they're not.  They're supposed to be...  Well, you hear those infomercials.  I watch those.  Shits are like snowflakes.  Yes.  They feel good to get in your hair.  And on your eyelashes.  You catch them on your tongue.  Snowflakes.  You'll be killing it.  You'll be knocking planes out of the skies  with those fucking...  Jesus Christ.  One of them said Barry Banzo. 
[03:30:00]  Holy shit.  I've taken some very big meaty ones.  I hate the shit piles.  What are you eating?  Can I ask you?  I'm very curious.  Sure.  I eat tabbouleh every night.  I eat pretty healthy.  I eat egg whites in the morning.  Yeah.  A lot of grilled chicken and asparagus steamed.  And my body responds by going,  Hey, thanks, Jim.  Here's a log.  A log?  A log cabin?  Jesus.  There's no better feeling than when you see one of those mighty shits periscoping out of the toilet. 
[03:30:30]  I'm glad that all my asshole's not that stretched.  I could never handle one of those.  They're perfect consistency.  They're like toothpaste.  They fucking are amazing, my shits.  He loves his shit.  Who doesn't?  Jim will be talking about this on Meet the Press Sunday morning with Cokie Roberts.  What do they call you again?  I'm trying to remember.  I just get queasy.  The cocksucker?  Well, not cocksucker.  I know they call you.  That show is filthy.  I'm not coming here anymore.  I know.  I'm completely embarrassed, Nick.  What's that? 
[03:31:00]  What do they call you again?  I know you have a name.  The Play-Doy?  What?  Playboy?  The shit.  Dough machine.  The what?  The shit.  The.  The.  You do know this.  The owner of the shit emporium?  No, no, no.  I was going this.  Oh, the ship salesman or something?  No, that's not.  He's so fucking with you.  I know he is.  You mean the shit pusher?  No, not that either.  Like when they try to push it in, I push it back in there?  Oh, my God. 
[03:31:30]  I guess maybe you don't have a nickname for that.  You'll push it out and I push it in like a damn one of them ice pusses.  Like a pop-up.  You push it out and I push it in.  Something cute.  Speaking of packing your shit.  Duty wars.  Say what I'm doing.  All right.  It's like I'm packing my shit.  We're not going to get the nick.  The whole room smells like desitin and powder.  You'll push it out and I'll push it in.  That's how they know I was bad.  When the hole in my wee-wee is all filled in with it.  Cement. 
[03:32:00]  You are.  What the fuck is that?  I had to snake out my penis hole.  You were sitting next to me.  It was packed like with clay.  How do you not?  Is anybody listening to your show anymore?  Because you guys would be arrested, wouldn't you, when you left the building after this  type of chatter?  You would think.  You would think.  Holy shit.  There's no better sound than that little Velcro thing.  Nick's nervous.  When the tape comes off.  Nick's nervous.  He doesn't sound good.  I don't do much duty stuff.  No.  You're missing out.  I'm not going to be cutting that out of the replay, Nick. 
[03:32:30]  Well, let's roll.  Thank you, Nick DiPaolo.  Yes.  Thanks for more shit talk.  Yes.  See you guys tomorrow.  We're talking colon health.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is next. </pre>
