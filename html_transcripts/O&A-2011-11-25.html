<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely centered around pranks, guest appearances, and the recurring "Spinning Wheel of Hate" segment. The show began with a discussion about a construction crane near the studio, escalating into a bizarre suggestion of listeners tickling Anthony, leading to a conversation about ticklishness involving Anthony, Roland, and potentially Jimmy.  A movie trailer for "Foot Fist Way" was shown and discussed, followed by a "Jocktober" segment mercilessly mocking Sam Roberts' radio show selections, with personal insults targeting his weight and appearance.  This was interspersed with several iterations of the "Spinning Wheel of Hate."

Early in the show, the "Spinning Wheel of Hate" targeted Bob Kelly, who had vomited in the studio.  The hosts detailed a prank where they placed his phone against someone's bare buttocks and photographed it.  Showing him the photo caused Kelly to vomit again.  Another "Spinning Wheel of Hate" victim was Danny, who was pranked into dressing formally for a nonexistent meeting with former general manager Tom Giasano.  A later segment of "Spinning Wheel of Hate" targeted E-Rock, focusing on mocking his on-air delivery and overuse of phrases like "plenty plenty more".  Another installment of the "Spinning Wheel of Hate" focused on Master Poe and his questionable offer of security for an online pajama party with Pal Talk models.  The final "Spinning Wheel of Hate" featured a diaper filled with Voss's baby's feces, which Opie was challenged to apply to his upper lip, resulting in Opie vomiting profusely, mirroring Bobby Kelly's reaction. Dr. Steve also made an appearance, examining Roland's prostate as a recurring "punishment."

Author Tucker Max was a guest, discussing anecdotes from his book "I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell," which detailed vomiting, defecation, and sexually explicit situations involving strippers and transsexuals. Callers challenged the veracity of his stories, which Max defended, sometimes admitting embellishment. One story involved a blowjob gone wrong, and another involved waking up in an ice-filled bathtub missing a kidney.  The segment was disrupted by technical difficulties with Max's microphone. Jim Norton was also present in the studio during the Tucker Max segment and throughout much of the broadcast, actively participating in the banter and mockery.

A prank orchestrated by an employee, Eric, involved the creation of believable memos simulating a scheduling conflict and corporate meeting about the show's content, which Opie and Anthony fell for completely.  Laszlo recounted a humorous camping trip with Danny, highlighting Dannyâ€™s lack of preparedness and physical fitness. The show also included a discussion about a mandatory sensitivity training in Washington, D.C., which the hosts, particularly Jim Norton, vehemently opposed, engaging in vulgar exchanges with XM's Eric Logan and ultimately avoiding the training through schedule manipulation.  Anthony fell asleep on-air for a significant period.  Throughout the broadcast, discussions about Danny's work ethic and attitude were woven into various segments. Finally, the show concluded with a hypothetical discussion about who would be shot first in a workplace shooting.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey everybody, how y'all doing out there?  The Worst of Opie and Anthony presents the show where everyone gets a turn in the barrel.  The Spinning Wheel of Hate!  Here's your host, Roland!  Hello, hello, hello.  Welcome to Spinning Wheel of Hate.  I'm Roland, I'm the producer and guest booker for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  And...  I don't know what I forgot.  I just blanked out.  Oh man, my head just blanked out.  The Spinning Wheel of Hate.  Where we highlight show segments and center around throwing someone under the bus or humiliating them.  How we select the victim is we spin the wheel.  Really?  And it lands on the name.  It could be a show member, a staff member, a regular guest, or even a celebrity.  Nobody's safe. 
[00:01:00]  Jesus Christ.  Let's spin the wheel and let's see who's first.  Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly?  Uh, dude!  Jesus.  As we do time to time, we make Bob throw up in the studio.  This particular time Bobby went for the bathroom and left the cell phone in the studio.  Uh-oh!  Find out what happens right now in Opie and Anthony.  Spinning Wheel of Hate!  Yay!  The Spinning Wheel of Hate! 
[00:01:30]  And we're Pat from Minaki.  We need the big showstopper today.  Don't pull us off, Pat.  Let's read this fucking faggity blog.  Alright, talking in movie theaters is the headline, current mood, annoyed.  I'm seeing some punctuations that might, uh, mean that somebody else might have to read  this.  Well, the punctuations are way down over days.  Alright.  Uh, why?  Because I don't read well?  Oh.  Why do you get a shit on Opie the day before vacation? 
[00:02:00]  I was, it was...  You could just come out and say it instead of...  I saw big capital letters with exclamation points and I thought...  Well, you could just say it instead of like...  Perhaps midge mean.  That's stupid.  I know what it means when you said that.  You don't want me to read this.  Why are you shitting on...  Why would you do that, Anthony?  I'm gonna read it upside down.  Sometimes I do that!  To look happy.  Save Frank DeFran.  We want that character to last.  Okay.  Don't mean to tear down the fifth wall or nothing. 
[00:02:30]  What are you saying?  That character's getting old?  I had a good one, too, for Frank DeFran.  Absolutely.  I had a good one.  Everybody just wants to go home.  You just held it.  I got about four minutes left.  Let's go, because I'm in overtime right now.  This is a talking in movie theater, so that would be annoyed.  Okay.  Opie, you want to read this?  I obviously can't read.  Next time, you might as well just tell me.  Jesus Christ!  Opie, you can read the signs. 
[00:03:00]  The one thing I am is smart.  Look, there's three paragraphs here.  And I'm really good at reading people.  Here it is.  I can't read things, but I'm good at reading people.  There's like three solid segments to this.  You read the first one.  Let Midge me read the second one.  Let Bob read the first one.  How about Bob reads the whole thing?  No, let Bob read the first one.  I'm not reading that.  All right.  Are you ready?  Let's do this.  Let's do this, Opie.  Because I'm dumber than anybody in this room.  All right.  You're not going to get an argument from anyone.  Read away. 
[00:03:30]  Jeez, I'm sticking up for you.  I just saw X-Men 3.  Wasn't a big fan of the movie.  Not as good as the others.  But this shit posting isn't about that.  On the show, there was an old bit where Anthony went to see Mission Impossible Deuce.  And people wouldn't shut up in the movie theater.  I happen to be in the same area.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is that? 
[00:04:00]  Get him.  Get him.  I got him.  Get him.  I got him.  Get him.  I got him.  Patrick Munaki had his asshole open while Bob was reading.  JP.  Totally distracted him.  That's why I said Bob reads.  I heard Pat was here.  So, Bob's reading.  Pat Munaki comes up right next to him. 
[00:04:30]  Pulls his pants down and spreads his ass cheeks.  And then.  And Big Kev, good call for coming in the wristband.  Very nice.  And then who said, like, Bobby, look.  I did.  I did.  Yeah, he goes, Bob, look.  Listen, listen.  Bob turned his head.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, God.  Turned his head and was point blank right into a pet. 
[00:05:00]  Wait, dude, please.  Pet's asshole.  You creep with the microphone.  Dude, I really want you to take Bob's phone.  Oh, God.  And not do anything off with it, but just put it against the back of your balls and take a picture  from it and show it to him while he's on the phone while he's on the phone.  Oh, God.  Someone call him.  Yeah, do it.  Yes.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, quick.  Make sure it isn't your man.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.  Quick. 
[00:05:30]  Turn around, stupid.  We'll erase the picture if you don't want it published.  Quick.  No, get the mic against the microphone.  Against your...  Put it right on it.  Put it on your ball.  Touch it.  Touch it.  Yeah.  Yeah, mouth part.  No, the mouth part on your ass.  Mouth part.  Put it against it.  Put it against it.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Now put it back.  Now put it back where it was.  Exactly where it was.  Put your pants up, my fucking homo.  Put it exactly where it was.  Put it in the sleeve or I'll stab you.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right.  And then somebody call him during the show here.  What's his name?  All right. 
[00:06:00]  Hold on.  Bob.  He's coming back.  Holy shit.  That is so fucking wrong.  What?  Hope this works out.  What, dude?  Just come back in.  Everything's all right.  That's horrible.  Let me see.  Oh, God, dude.  Let me see, Yorah.  That's fucking gross.  That's the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, God damn.  This asshole was brown.  Yeah.  Brown and yellow. 
[00:06:30]  You should have got the phone.  You all right?  You should have got the phone against it.  We do.  It was yellow and brown and purple.  Yeah.  Do it.  Believe me.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  Mic shot.  Mic shot.  Let's hit.  All right.  Listen.  We're doing a bit.  Oh, by the way, save this for when we get back.  Seriously.  Tell him to test his cell phone and call you or something like that.  Tell him to do it.  Like we're doing something else.  We always have competitions about phones.  Yeah, I know.  Maybe I could say.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Someone just calls number from outside the studio.  No, you might have answered.  Let's make it like we're talking about our phones. 
[00:07:00]  Who cares if the answers are?  Because mine, it's small.  Bobby.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  He's got his pants on.  And I don't care what he's.  He's got his pants on.  Dude, you're assholes.  No, that is disgusting.  Vomitable.  And I don't care.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Okay.  Come in.  Still me.  Bring it in, buddy.  I'm not a fan.  I don't hate my phone.  No, listen.  Listen, speaking of phones.  No fucking way.  Bob.  What?  Tell these guys what was happening.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Nothing. 
[00:07:30]  Shut up.  I don't fucking trust you guys.  Actually.  What's happening?  I'll tell you.  Listen.  You all got phones in your hands.  No.  Tell the guys.  Yes.  What happens with your phone?  It hangs up on itself because of your fat cheeks?  Did he put the phone in his ass?  No.  No.  Oh.  Is that a ring?  Why did we think of that?  No, actually.  My what?  This is actually a legitimate question.  While you were puking and cleaning up.  We thought it was funny because you were talking about it.  When you answer phone calls, you hang up on yourself because you're fat cheeks.  Mine absolutely will not.  Can I tell you guys something?  You don't go from fucking zero to 60. 
[00:08:00]  Hold on.  You were puking.  We were trying to talk to you.  You didn't have fucking headphones.  So the bit was kind of done.  I can't get his asshole out of my head.  He got into the fact that he told about when you hung up with your fat cheek and I said  that's why I have fucking flip phones.  I set this thing wrong.  This is absolutely.  That's you.  I set this wrong.  It will say that it's calling.  But I won't hear anything.  Because I have a setting.  Listen.  And I'll only have a flip phone.  It's connected.  Look.  Because the assholes.  Answer and talk to me but do not.  Assholes.  Tell me if you can hear me. 
[00:08:30]  The dial and fucking call you from the car and they don't even know that they're fucking  talking to you.  He's checking out the phone.  It's fine.  Just do it you idiot.  It's not ringing.  Huh?  I'm not an idiot.  I'm a human being.  Pick it up and you will hear it.  But you're checking out an idiot I'm a human being.  We didn't do anything to your phone.  Look.  It's not ringing.  I'm looking at the fucking phone.  Why is this not?  It says.  Oh wait.  Last call.  Hold on.  You probably hop on it.  I don't have your number.  No.  Mine says connected.  Huh?  I need your number.  Three, four, seven.  I didn't have it.  Don't give out his fucking number on me.  You got it?  See now it says connected. 
[00:09:00]  Seven, eight.  Your phone stinks.  That's why.  No.  It's just I have a setting wrong.  What's going on?  Try it.  Try it.  Do you want me to call you?  Try it.  Try what?  Call me.  I guarantee you.  I want to see if it will ring.  We never exchange numbers.  Like I don't.  You don't like Bob.  I just got like.  Bob I now like you.  Like fans number is pretty much the only person I have that I really shouldn't have.  Is it ringing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But watch.  Now it's ringing.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Hello?  Nope.  Yeah.  Hello.  Do you hear anything from me?  No.  No.  I just.  I'm connected.  It does ring.  But now watch.  This is why I have this fucking headphone.  They'll bust my balls about this two headphones.  God damn fucking air traffic controller.  Yeah.  I know.  But look at this.  Now it's plugged in.  The headphone's plugged in.  I hear you great.  See?  Now this is through my headphone here.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I can somehow.  It's all going.  Or that one.  Yeah.  I can hit you. 
[00:10:00]  The fuck is that dude?  That's.  I mean.  It's fucking.  It's like.  What's wrong Bob?  Breeze deep together.  Fucking vagina.  What's wrong Bob?  No.  No.  It's not dude.  I don't think you got a good enough look at it.  Wait.  Bob.  You didn't get that.  There's something a little different about that picture.  Bob.  You might want to look at that.  Ask me a question.  Mike, Bob, you might want to look at that picture a little closely.  I don't want to look at that.  No, just zoom up. 
[00:10:30]  Well, just take a little look at it.  Oh!  You put my phone in your ass, you fucking savage.  No.  Just the back of the ball.  Just the back of the ball.  Dude, I lost my fucking phone.  That's over the line.  That's over the line.  A fucking bagel on the ground is one thing.  Show me.  You put my fucking $700 trio in his asshole.  Who fucking does that?  That's over the line.  They made me.  You didn't fucking have to stick it in your ass, you circus freak. 
[00:11:00]  You fucking cocksucker.  Now you owe me $700.  I'm not fucking with that phone anymore.  You stuck it in your fucking fat pussy.  I paid for a new one with my winnings, too.  Did he stick it in his ass?  I didn't even look at the photo.  Look at the photo.  You have to.  Look at the photo.  You might be happy.  Don't worry so much.  The mic went out, Jimmy.  Look at the picture.  The mic went out.  He's looking at the picture now.  Eric.  Oh, he's fuking. 
[00:11:30]  You all right, Bob?  Oh, God.  Bob, you all right?  What's wrong with this asshole?  Has a phone in it.  I'm with you on that.  I really don't know, but there is something wrong with his head.  Did you see the phone in the picture?  Did a plane crack and go off?  It really is red and open.  Two Nathan's hot dogs went through that asshole.  Dude, it looks like an open wound.  Yeah.  See your phone?  E-Rock, you're off the hook.  Your face is right at the right now.  We'll read the blog when we get back.  Oh, fuck.  I'm going to wash my phone now because his fucking cunt was in it. 
[00:12:00]  That's fine.  Which part was it?  The mouth part, stupid.  The part you put up to your face.  The ear part.  Oh, God.  He's puking.  How can anybody not like that?  Bob, by the way, I'm sorry I called you a liar. 
[00:12:30]  I'm sorry.  Bob, look at me for a second.  Bob.  Bob, turn around, please.  Give me his asses right in his face.  Poor Bob has such a...  Bob, Bob!  He has such a very...  He has a sour stomach.  Sour stomach.  No, he doesn't have any...  What is that called? 
[00:13:00]  Stomach bile left?  Like, some people can take that shit.  That is classic.  Others, like...  He's got no constitution for that kind of thing.  All right.  The phone...  When he saw the picture of the phone touching the back of your ball sack.  That echoes rules.  Oh, is that fucking funny?  He pukes on Torgasm a bunch, too, man. 
[00:13:30]  It's the real deal.  Bob!  Goddamn fucking bagel.  Bob!  Can you hear us in there?  No.  Oh.  Yeah, I got you.  Bob!  How'd the phone smell?  Oh, his fucking ass was in my phone.  You're a good sport.  You're a good sport to the Opie and Anthony show.  You all right?  You feeling any better?  Why would you put my fucking phone in something like that? 
[00:14:00]  In something like that.  Pat's gonna cry.  It's not that bad.  You should talk on that phone again.  You should get that fucking tumor removed.  I don't know what the hell was going on with that.  I don't even want to know.  Is that Jim?  What?  Jim, don't.  I don't want to see your ass, Jim.  Yeah, Jimmy told me to stall.  Jim, are you pissing on the ground?  Dude, you're pissing on the ground.  What kind of fucking freak show is this?  Jimmy will just walk in the bathroom and start pissing on the floor. 
[00:14:30]  He's a fucking animal.  Oh, God.  Just put down wood chips for him.  Like wood shavings.  He's like a fucking hamster.  How do you wash your cell phone?  You don't.  By the way, Danny the Trucker is saying this is revenge for Bob's anti-trucker promo he did.  Yeah, that must be it.  That's exactly it.  All right.  Are you boys done in there?  Oh, God.  Bob?  Yeah, I'm coming.  All right.

[00:23:00]  he's gotta shave  like up to his  neck like he's  got a neckline  shave where the  chest hair  I think he has  a barber's chair  and some old man  comes in with that  leather strap  and that straight  straight razor  yeah  so uh  airs him up  down to his  navel  well this all  started with an  email we're gonna  like have a  meeting soon  just to see how  everything's going  yeah  you know  see how it's  going back on  commercial radio  and all that  and that's when  Ben and the gang  decided this would  be a good time  to kind of  screw down 
[00:23:30]  yeah like a  meeting with the  bosses to go  over any of  our needs  because then you  asked what the  meeting's about  and they said  something like  Tom is not  happy about how  people are  dressing around  here  yeah it was  like part of  it  because Tom  is always so  well dressed  Tom is like  dressed to the  nines every day  suit tie  like fitted  suits  slacks  gazillion dollars  worth of suits  and you're  kind of  intimidated  walking up to  him dressed like  a slob  probably 
[00:24:00]  I would think  I would think  if you're then  told that there's  going to be a  meeting involving  Tom about a  dress code  that you're then  thinking oh my god  this guy wears like  suits that cost  thousands  I gotta go to  TJ Maxx and  pick up some  slags  yeah I mean  plus you know  I guess they did  a good job of  filling everybody  in on it so  you know no  matter who I  called  they all know  yeah  but here is the  major flaw in  there  I mean obviously  I guess  major flaw  as you're sitting  there in brand 
[00:24:30]  new clothes  that you went  out and bought  yesterday afternoon  the victim  is sitting there  the major flaw  he's dressed like  he's going to a  PTA meeting  major flaw is  you fell for the  entire thing  I say it's a  minor flaw  yeah what is the  little tiny flaw  the thing that  made me think  something was  awry  so to speak  was that  no one could  give me  a story  like it was  all very very  but you didn't  have enough  confidence  that's perfect  for this crew  because no one  ever has the  story in this  crew  it's always  vague 
[00:25:00]  yes somebody  look at him  trying to  downplay it  you're in  brand new  clothes  you didn't  have enough  confidence to  come in  dress like  you usually  dress  you thought  in the back  of your head  that this  could be real  so I better  dress appropriately  plus it's a lot  harder to get  eight people on  the exact same  lie so just  keep it vague  and then the  stories don't  get tripped up  a little roll  of the eyes  from Danny  I saw that  he's not happy  he's very pissed  let me tell you  there's going to  be hell to pay  because this  all goes back 
[00:25:30]  and forth  so now Danny's  going to come up  with some  retaliation  he's plotting  you can see it  it's  it's alright  by the way  once in a while  somebody just  makes an ass  out of you  it just happens  Bert from Philly  again  he's a regular  dressed to the  nines  is that a  1940s reference  what the F  does that mean  dressed to the  nines  23 skidoo  he's dressed to  the nines  and smoking  Lucky Strike 
[00:26:00]  cigarettes  in his  brand new  slacks  always have  a pack  of Lucky's  or Chesterfield's  in the  pants pocket  of my  slacks  Anthony had  his first drink  at a speakeasy  yeah  had to have  the right  knock  everything opened  up  is payback  going to be  a bitch  there Danny  well probably  not since  you know  the little  sewing circle  will never  get on my  side  he's like 
[00:26:30]  he's like  naked man  he's just  alienated  from public  is there a  click  well  than  comment  little  sewing circle  is there  a click  going on  like  it's forming  I think  of you guys  all as the  same  pieces of  crap  like  there's no  hierarchy  when I look  at you  you're all  equally  worthless  to me  well thank  you Anthony  no problem  not as far  as work 
[00:27:00]  goes  I mean of course  you guys do your job  you do it very well  as far as just  your worth  in life  and how it affects  me  and my life  again not through  work  just  just in life  you're equally  Travis  you are the same  piece of garbage  as Than  as Danny  it just doesn't  matter to me  well there's  clicks but they're  always shifting  like for instance  two days ago  we locked  Travis out  of the office  and it posted  false comments  from his  MySpace account 
[00:27:30]  was he looking  in  laughing  in horror  I wasn't happy  and after about  25 seconds  he gets the  okay bits over  stop messing  with me look  and that's when  it gets even  more fun  that's when  it's supposed  to get more  fun  that's when  the joke  begins  hey by the way  Tim in California  has a good  observation  Tim what's up  hey what are you  guys doing  insulting  about half  of your audience  by saying  we all look  like dirtbags  yeah our audience  dresses like  Danny's dress  today  of course 
[00:28:00]  of course  I just don't  have a chain  drive wallet  that's about it  it's it's  called dressing  comfortably  you're very  comfortable  alright just  just take the  joke Tim  come on  and what they  do also is  they'll leave  each other's  emails open  they'll forget  like walk away  from the computer  and then I  could be guaranteed  to get an email  that night  from one  of the crew  who of course  found somebody  else's email  open and it's  usually something  like hey  Anthony  it's Travis  here  the appearance 
[00:28:30]  went real well  the other day  I was thinking  you know  maybe me and  you could hang  out go out  to dinner  I think we  have a lot  in common  you're so funny  and it's one  of these idiots  on his email  just typing  so I'll type  back something  you know hey  that sounds like  a great idea  you know  let's make  a date  of it  see when  your calendar  is free  and if I'm  not shooting  myself in the  face that day  I might be  able to make  it  something like  that  so one day  they left  Danny's open  and typed 
[00:29:00]  something  I can't  even remember  what it was  but I was  so pissed  that day  I just wrote  F off  on the thing  and used  the entire  word  and for like  a day and a half  two days  Danny actually  thought I was  mad at him  because I didn't  add some  witty little  thing  because usually  you get more  than just that  so I'm thinking  oh man  maybe this is  finally the day  I thought I'd  change it up  a little bit  alright we're  going to break  and catch up  a little bit  so Danny  alright  yeah I'm just  waiting for tomorrow 
[00:29:30]  maybe I'll switch  my coffee with  decaf or something  find out who  gets annihilated  next as the  worst of Opie  and Anthony's  spitting wheel  of hate  continues  welcome back  the vicious  verbal beatdown  keeps a coming  the worst of  Opie and Anthony  presents the  spitting wheel  of hate  welcome back  to the  spitting wheel  of hate  I'm your host  Roland 
[00:30:00]  time to spill  the wind again  oh  I'm just  spitting the  will again  and see who  is our next  victim  Tucker Max  who the  fuck is that  I booked  that asshole  well it says  here he was  on the show  promoting the  book  I apologize  for that  interview  about how  he got so  many girls  but we  called them  out on that  bullshit  here it is  the spitting  wheel  of hate  hate books 
[00:30:30]  what the  hell is  this  Tucker Max  oh  he actually  was on the  New York Times  bestseller list  oh  really  heard of that  list  alright let's  get him in  here then  get him in  here right now  somebody before  I start kicking  ass  excuse me  drunk scale  suck this  cock  black out  hook up with  ugly or fat  girls  make loud  boisterous  what's up  man  come on  yeah take a  seat my  friend  highly entertaining  highly entertaining 
[00:31:00]  and thoroughly  reprehensible  the New York  Times  that's what  they said  look at you  Tucker Max  I hope they  serve beer  in hell  is the name  of the  book  what is it  about  what's the  it's about  everything I do  in my life  it's about me  I'm not good  at doing anything  else except  writing about  myself  alright good  wait so  hold on  I can curse  and stuff  we're on  oh yeah  you fucking  can  don't even  worry about  it  yeah  say curse  for us  alright  fuck  the only thing  you can't do 
[00:31:30]  is put  profanity  the only  regulation  you have  is you can't  mix and match  a verb  with profanity  you can say  a cunt fart  is fine  but cunt  like a cunt  sniffing  is unacceptable  ah  you got it  you got it  alright  so what's the  book about  it's your life  basically  a bunch of  short stories  about stuff  that happened  to me  I mean  I'm just  an average  20 something  idiot  that goes out  and gets  drunk  and does  stupid shit  except I  just write  about it  that's pretty  much it  one time 
[00:32:00]  I hooked up  with this girl  and went back  to her place  and she was  in the bathroom  we were done  she was in the  bathroom  peeing  so she wouldn't  get a UTI  and I had to  throw up  I was so drunk  and I couldn't  go in her  bathroom  so I just  threw up  under her bed  and then  she came back  out and we  started hooking  up again  and the next  thing I know  I'm hearing  this jingling  noise  and I'm like  what the fuck  is that  and so I  stop  I think it's  the bed  moving  from sex  and then  I stop  and she's  like  the noise  is still  going  and she's  like 
[00:32:30]  oh that's  just my dog  he always  licks himself  when I'm  having sex  and then all  of a sudden  I'm like  oh my god  he's not  licking himself  he's eating  the vomit  so there I'm  like you know  having sex  or fucking  I guess  I'm fucking  this girl  and the dog  is like  I almost  couldn't stay  hard  I had to  focus  normally you gotta  focus  to hold it in  and I had to  focus  just to stay  hard  I had a chick  this is true  too  not long ago  she was blowing  me  and I fucking  like when I 
[00:33:00]  when I come  you know how it is  when you  like if I grab  the bone  you fucking  push your hips  and I'm a shooter  like I fucking  blast  and I fucking  crammed it  and I hear  and I've never  actually had it  happen  all over my  fucking  balls  and on my  bed  dude  did she  it's in the  book  and she's like  I'm sorry  she's like  I'm sorry  I ate a muffin  before I came  I had muffin  all over me  no the best  my favorite  blowjob story  I got two  favorites 
[00:33:30]  one is  this girl  took me  you know  back to her  place  she was  kind of chunky  but she  kind of had  that look  like she  could suck  the fuck  out of you  so we  go back  to her  place  and I  take off  pants  and we're  sitting on  her sofa  and she's  blowing me  it was  unbelievable  the type of  blowjob  makes your  ankle sweat  you know  and so  she gets  up  like  afterwards  I guess  to go  wash out  her mouth  or whatever  and I  stand up  and you know  put my  pants on  and there's  a huge  skid mark  on her  white sofa  from me  I didn't know 
[00:34:00]  what to do  you know  because like  it was  the worst  part was  like  you know  like  she comes  out of  the bathroom  and I'm  like oh  my god  and so  I couldn't  flip the  sofa  like the  cushion  in front  of her  so you  know  so I  sweep  her up  all  romantically  and carry  her in  the bedroom  I kind  and then  you know  after I  hooked up  with her  four or  five times  or whatever  until one  of us  passed  or she  passed out  and then  I went  and flipped  the cushion  after she  was asleep  a big  fucking  brown  skid mark  that or 
[00:34:30]  the time  that  one time  this girl  burped  like you know  she swallowed  and then burped  wouldn't it  have been funny  if when you  turn the skid  mark  cushion over  there was  another one  on the other  side  facing the  other way  that would  be great  alright  let's go  to Brett  in Boston  Brett  what's up  hey Opie  how's it  going bud  hey  so this guy  Tucker Max  I guess he's  got a website  I've read a bunch  of his stories  but they're the ones  that are just  on the edge  of believable  but if they're  true  he's a stud 
[00:35:00]  so Tucker  can you tell  the story  about your  Tucker Tries  Butt Sex  story  yeah  alright  that's  the one  everyone  asks for  alright  this story  this is a  true story  I was maybe  20  21  spending a summer  in Florida  when I was  in college  and I met  this one girl  she's really  hot  and I  never tried  butt sex  before  and I really  wanted to  so I kept  trying to convince  this girl  and she wouldn't  she's like  no I don't  know  so I finally  convinced her  I'm like  look  she wanted to be  a runway model  that's why she was  living in South Beach 
[00:35:30]  I was in Florida  at the time  and I'm like  it's what all the  models do  blah blah blah  and so I finally  convinced her  by convincing her  that it was  the European way  to have sex  this is the level  of intelligence  of this girl  and so  anyway  so  but she's like  you know  you have to  take me to  a nice dinner  and it's got  to be like  a production  so I take her  out  and we go to  some restaurant  Tantra actually  and I spent like  400 bucks  on this girl  on dinner  and you know  two like  good bottles  of wine  and whatever  so she's totally  ready  and we go back  to my place  and what I 
[00:36:00]  hadn't told her  you gotta remember  I was like  20  I think  20 or 21  at the time  and like  I'm kind of  an asshole now  but I was  possibly the worst  person on earth  at this point  in my life  so what I  hadn't told her  was that  my buddy and I  decided that  since this is  going to be the  first time  I've had butt sex  that I wanted  to videotape it  right  but instead of  just like  setting up  like a camera  this is like  nine years ago  so it was before  like you know  like really cheap  cameras  we had like  one of the  like the sort  of shoulder ones  right right  that had like  the VHS  sort of like that  except the crappy  version  right right  and so my buddy 
[00:36:30]  hid in the closet  with the camera  and was going to  film us  like so he was  hanging out at my  place and then  he saw us pull up  and he was going to  go run in the closet  and hide  and so I was  so shit faced  by the time  that I got back  at this point  I had pretty much  forgotten that he  was in there  so we go in  we start kissing  whatever  and then  you know like  she's like  okay I'm ready  and so I bought  like you know  one of the big  industrial like  this size  of like Astroglide  like it's like  huge  because I didn't  know  what the fuck  do I know  about ass sex  you know  and so I'm  figuring well  you know  a little bit's 
[00:37:00]  good so more  is better  so I basically  just  now here I am  filming this girl  but at the same  time I'm thinking  okay you know  hurt her anus  so I pretty much  like uncap it  and just stick it  in her ass  and just squeeze  and I emptied  like half the bottle  because I'm thinking  you know you gotta  put enough in  to make sure  because I don't  know how much  it takes  what do I know  right  and so  this is like  pretty much  pre-internet porn  you know  and like  I thought you could  just spit on your dick  and you know  like no  that's only  important movies  right  that's the prison way  right  so I fill her up 
[00:37:30]  with this stuff  and then of course  I slide right in  no problem  and everything's  going great for a while  and you know  and we start  going harder  and harder  and she's more  into it  and I'm more  into it  and like  I'm right about  to come  and you know  I'm slamming hard  coming way in  and out  and I come out  too far  and I kind of  like you know  I come out  and I like  you know  hit her butt  or something  so I go down  to put myself  back in  and all of a sudden  I feel this  like warm splash  on my hand  and I'm like  the lights are  kind of low  so I look down 
[00:38:00]  and it's like  kind of dark  and I'm like  wait a minute  and then the smell  hits me  she shit  all over my dick  and it wasn't  just like poop  it was like  watery  diarrhea  fucking mix  of like  diarrhea  and Astroglide  and so  the smell  hits me  and it was like  oh my  and then of course  I realized  she shit  on my dick  and then combine  that with like  the seafood  and the two bottles  of wine  and I just  I blew all  over her ass  like in her  asshole  everywhere 
[00:38:30]  and so  I'm throwing up  and she's like  kind of hammered  so she like  turns out  she's like  Tucker  what are you doing  she sees me  throwing up  she goes  oh my god  she starts  throwing up  everywhere  so I'm seeing  her throwing up  and it's making  me throw up  I'm throwing up  more  all of a sudden  true fucking story  my fucking buddy  falls out of the closet  and he's like  oh my god  because he saw us  and smelled it  you can imagine  the smell  you know  it's like  seafood and wine  and Astroglide  and shit  and he fucking  is throwing up  everywhere  so like  there's like  a three second period 
[00:39:00]  where all three of us  are staring at each other  vomiting everywhere  that video would be like  I know  you have no idea  how upset I am  I don't have that  I know  and so anyway  so she like  you know  of course freaks  oh I thought you loved me  I can't believe you did this  throws you know  the sheet  like  wraps the shit  and Astroglide  stained sheet around her  runs out of my apartment  like leaves her clothes  everything  I still to this day  don't know how she got home  like I called her  you know  three or four times 
[00:39:30]  are you okay  whatever  she ended up  changing her phone number  like the girl  who introduced us  like you know  she wouldn't return  her calls  I don't know  how she got home  but yeah  it was  I didn't get my deposit  back on that apartment  we couldn't  we couldn't get the smell out  we tried for days  it was disgusting  you're a good boy  let's go to Steve  in Houston  Steve  hey what's going on boys  hey Steve  hey Tucker Max  holy shit  you are the king shit  your stories are some of the funniest shit I've ever heard 
[00:40:00]  but  thanks  I had two questions  the first of which was  how did that lawsuit ever come out  which one yeah  there's been like three  Miss America  Miss Vermont  yeah  the story is this girl  I like hooked up with this girl for about a month  and like you know it's no big deal  I met her at the gym  we ended up going to dinner  getting drunk  fucking like that night  whatever  so she's a slut  no big deal  like god bless her  but she has this website  where she  she claims to be like  abstinent  and like sober  and like she sets herself up  as like a role model  for little girls 
[00:40:30]  so I wrote a story  after like you know  a month of this  I wrote a story  just the true story  about our relationship  and I used a real name  and I never ever used real names  except for my own  and hers was the only one  because I was just calling her out  as being a hypocrite  and so she sued me  and lost  she ended up  we removed the case  to federal court  and they ended up  withdrawing their claim  because they were  going to get smoked  so I mean  I won  but it was like  it wasn't like a big  it was a big deal  that like  you know the case at first  because it was like  an internet landmark  whatever 
[00:41:00]  first amendment case  but I won  that's all that matters  well the other thing was  I gotta say  that sushi pants  has to be my  favorite story  of all of them  yeah thanks  alright man  appreciate it  alright  god damn  makes you put all of it  in a book  money  yeah  fucking smart moves  26 of the times  bestseller list right  yeah  two weeks on the bestseller list  and like  the best part was  there was no book reviews  no one would review it  because like 
[00:41:30]  oh this is whatever  you know  frat boy humor  snobby douchebags  how did you get a buzz  going on this book  my website dude  my website  so your website was popular  before the book  I'm assuming  yeah the book is like  half stories from the website  half new stuff  right  and like  I get like a million  visitors a month  to my site  I get a ton of traffic  and so  I've got like  a bunch of fans  so  when did you start  the website  website started  in 2002  yeah  like  it was funny  I sent  not none of these  exact stories  but basically

[00:45:00]  when we were in law  school and like the  the big like climax  of the story was when  uh my buddy  Slingblade who he  called about he  literally stopped up  a hotel toilet and  like that's like I  didn't think it was  possible but the dude  took such a dump  that it was like  overflowing and I  had to you know it's  like after we got  back from drinking I  had to shit like  something terrible so  I end up like going  down to the lobby and  I can't find the  bathroom because like  the way the lobby was  arranged and I end up  shitting my pants all  over and like running  around the lobby and  um yeah I got kicked  out of it I got banned  from embassy suites  forever yeah I shit all  over it was awful it 
[00:45:30]  was so embarrassing I  shit all over myself and  I get back up to the  hotel up to the room  after like I finally  found a bathroom  halfway through shitting  myself and I get back  up and I'm covered  like little my whole back  is covered and shit  because I've been  running around the  lobby and my buddy  literally tore an ab  muscle he was laughing  so hard at me  did he did he  he's a cocksucker  right of course  because it's his fault  right  by the way if you do  that movie um I want  to play the big piece  of shit that clogged  the toilet  let's go to Kent

[00:47:00]  you know  if I had known  I was gonna  become a writer  motherfucker  I would have  you know  gone through  hell and high  water to save  that tape  you know how much  money I've cost  myself  I could have  charged 10 bucks  a person  I was in a frat  me and the boys  would have figured  out how to save  that tape  let's be honest  we would have  figured something  out  hell yeah man  if somebody  fucked me in the  ass and threw  up on me  I would want  that tape  saved  I mean  let's go to  let's go to  angry little  fellow  angry 
[00:47:30]  what's up  talking  what's up  fellas  what's up  Tucker I came  across your  website  wipe off the  screen  lol  anyways I came  across your  website when I  was looking for  Absinthe online  did you tell them  about driving  into the donut  shop yet  no it's  I mean  it's like  18 pages  in the book  basically I got  shit faced  on Absinthe  and this girl  and I was  like really drunk  and this girl  was like oh  I'm too drunk  to drive home  you gotta drive 
[00:48:00]  and I was like  alright  so I ended up  driving her  home  and then she  like had me  drop her off  at her  like apartment  building  and she's like  we'll go find  parking place  and when you  find it  then come up  and I couldn't  find a parking  spot and I was  fucking pissed  off at her  so I ended up  like parking  you know  I found a spot  and it was like  kind of too small  but I was still  trying to cram  the car in there  and I ended up  jumping the curb  and like running  the back of the car  into a donut shop  and like crashing  the window down  and shit  and so then I  just pulled  I got all scared  so I just pulled  the car off  and like parked 
[00:48:30]  it somewhere  and threw the keys  like in the bushes  and then like  went home  I didn't even  go up to her  spot  yeah so  I mean like  you gotta read  the story  when you condense  18 pages  into like  it's not  it's funny  yeah  a sentence  was there ever  a police report  no dude  I looked  and looked  and looked  and I never  found one  I remember  one time  I was in  Colorado  back in like  96  and I was  fucking horny  and um  yeah  Boulder  right  and I was like  fuck I'm like  at Lakes  I don't know  even in Colorado  and I went to 
[00:49:00]  a Christmas party  and then I snuck  back that night  and I went  downstairs  and I snuck  away  and nobody  ever figured  out what  happened  I just hear  some  another tragedy  just befell  that family  yeah  well  let's  let's go to  Nathan  let's go to  Nathan and Jericho  hey man  what do you say  Nate  welcome aboard  hey Jimmy 
[00:49:30]  I love you buddy  how you doing  alright  listen Tucker  I just wanted  to thank you  because um  it's really nice  to see somebody  actually documents  some of the crazy  stuff that goes on  this stuff does  happen  and uh  I think most of  the time  it's really just  it's likely to  happen when you  pay attention  to a girl  and uh  I don't think  a lot of guys  realize that  you're able  to do a lot  of this stuff  once you actually  listen to her  she'll pretty much  let you do  whatever you'd like  yeah I mean  whatever  that's what I 
[00:50:00]  always tell people  I'm like  plenty of people  have stories  that are just as  funny  or just as cool  as mine  they just don't  write them down  I mean  like  if you think  about it  it was just  a crashed out  window  in a donut shop  I don't think  anyone would  call the cops  on that  alright  let's uh  let's go to  uh  Kyle in Michigan  Kyle  yeah  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  the lucky  Louie star  Jim Norton  hi Kyle  thanks for  calling the  program  get to the  point  Max have any  good gay or 
[00:50:30]  funny stories  yeah we do a  segment called  gay or funny  and people call  in with their  stories and then  we decide if it's  a gay moment  or a funny  moment  both being  kind of gay  but one  the humor in it  is so much  that it takes  the gay away  like an example  would be  and we've all  seen this  like a guy  dozes off at a  party  right  and a bunch  of guys  stand around  with their  hogs in his  face  and you take  a picture  it's kind  of gay  but it's  more funny  when he wakes  up and sucks  them all  then it becomes  hotter funny  lol 
[00:51:00]  fucking silly  goose  oh cut it  out  you'll give  me those  ribs  and no one  calls the  cops  no one  does  I've got  one  this uh  I didn't  really realize  at the time  like when I  was living in  South Florida  I ended up  like hooking up  with whatever  dating this  one stripper  and she was  you know  like tall  and big fake  tits  and she couldn't  lubricate on  pussy but couldn't  you know  which  happens to  some girls  but it turns  out that  one of my  buddies is gay  he thinks that  it was actually  a post-op  transsexual 
[00:51:30]  like in that  you know  because she had  fake tits  like about  my height  but you know  can't lubricate  you're a liar  well that one  I don't know  post-op  transsexual  I think  you feel  here's what it is  and I know  I've hooked up  with one  that's how I know  and it wasn't  on purpose  but you feel  the inside  is like  it's not  lubricating  it is  you're right  it's fucking  like a  like a change  purse  and it's hard  a tranny pussy  and again  I realize  in hindsight  it's a harder  it doesn't feel 
[00:52:00]  natural  there's something  about it  hey guys  punch it out  alright take care man  be good  you too  godspeed  alright let's say  hi to scott  in texas  scott  hey boys  how's it going  hey we're on  with tucker  max  hey tucker  what's the name  of your book  I hope they serve  beer in hell  okay thanks  that was it  alright you wanted  to leave them  with one more  story there tucker  um  no  they're all  alright let me think  um  I'm trying to think

[01:08:30]  had a  tape  like that  you would  never tape  over it  or anything  when he  said he  puked on  her back  I could  almost  go  it went  too far  once she  started puking  it's like  do you  understand  the type  of fucking  awful radio  we do  like come  on man  we're not  frat guys  and then  everyone  started puking  and I got  it the dog  started puking  and the bird  flew in  and it was  puking  and then my  friend rolled  out of the  closet  he's puking  so then I'm  puking more  and where's  the tape  and then she  runs out of  the room  with a  a sheet  covered in  shit  and puked  and wraps  it around 
[01:09:00]  her and  she blows  off her  clothes  and he  crashes a  car into  a donut  shop  and there's  no police  report  and he  just throws  the keys  in a bush  and leaves  the car  there  yeah  bullshit  that was  a little  bit  over the  you should  have left  that stuff  for the  book  but if  you knew  who you  were talking  to  as far  as  the  believability  you would  have kept  it to a  minimum  and just  went  what was  obvious  it was  fun at  first  and then  when he  told that  story  I felt

[01:41:00]  really good reviews  and i like i said  i didn't know what to think  of his fucking head  yeah and it's uh  oh that was the best one  jesus  roland is a very ticklish boy  he certainly is  jimmy goes to me  we gotta get roland in here  because  and i don't know how you knew this  but you  you told me that when  you tickle roland 
[01:41:30]  he makes silly noises  sounds like a girl scout  in a funny movie  i actually  i discovered it accidentally  what do you mean  really  i missed and hit his taint  no i just tickled him one time  it was a goof  because he's just  you know roland's just so lovable  he was just standing  i just was just joking  and i tickled him  to be stupid  he went  and i said file that noise  that has to happen again  unbelievable  by the way  since roland sat down  we're up to 86.2  and rising fast  yeah  in the xm studios  roland right now

[01:42:30]  he's a really funny dude  will he come in or no  um he's filming in la  okay  by the way  his wife in the movie  worst actress ever  ever  just a friend  just a friend  obviously  she's never done acting before  it's so not believable  when she's on screen  with the guy  the guy's hilarious  though how he talks  to his students  and everything  yeah and his character  is pretty funny  because he does  uh  oh my god 
[01:43:00]  and bigger stronger faster  got uh great reviews  100% uh positive reviews  on rotten tomatoes so far  what's that  the steroid movie  oh yeah yeah  i want to see that  that one and uh  we interviewed the guy  he was he was a lot of fun  that one and the first  fist fist way  are the top two  mussy movies  yeah  yeah  this is our new bit  fucking movie reviews  with laughing rolling  oh my god  write it down  we start  we do this weekly now  it'd be funny if you did it  while he's reviewing  like schindler's list

[01:44:00]  said he would call  into the show  yeah get right on mic  there with your sweaty  forehead  get him a headband  oh yeah it's going  into his eyes  holy shit  is it stingy  yes  look no one else  is sweating  is this aerobic exercise  for you  yeah  roland wears like  fucking short sleeve shirts  it's literally 30 degrees out  and he's bumbling down the street  or fucking short sleeve shirts  yeah in the winter  he'll wear that  yeah  he'll wear that in the winter  he's never cold  no but he gets hot  he doesn't own a winter coat  did you just say that  i'm sorry  no no  i'm staring at this fucking crane 
[01:44:30]  across the street  wondering when it's our turn  i know what the fuck  we have one of these huge cranes  literally right  it's hanging  right over your head  across the street  right behind anthony's head  and if that thing fell  like the one that just fell  on the upper east side  here in new york  we'd be fucked  it would fucking  the sound coming out  of that thing  would be like  that's the crane operator  you know can we do like  uh i don't know  i'm thinking like  an all out  can we put you on the floor  with microphones  and maybe allow the listeners 
[01:45:00]  that showed up today  to tickle you  for like 10 seconds  no  they're begging  rolling  they're begging  no  they're very ticklish  come on  we'll end the tickle bit  with you just getting tickled  by like 10 dudes  no  that's awkward  it is awkward  how about just one dude  how about master poe  ew no  who do you want to tickle you  yeah  how about sam  sam looks like he's a good tickler  who would you like to tickle you  you don't have a choice  um  jimmy i guess  okay  but jimmy's been tickling you 
[01:45:30]  can he sit on your belly  jesus  i can see my reflection  in his forehead  right now  it really is amazing  it's like a fucking mirror  roland  also turned me on  to surf wise  which was amazing  uh the heckler  what was the best movie  you've seen  in the last  couple weeks  uh probably  is the  foot fist way  foot fist way  it sounds dirty  there hasn't been  i mean there's been  okay movies  do we have a trailer  for foot fist way  just to maybe give  people a little taste  there's a red band trailer 
[01:46:00]  on youtube  yeah  all we have to do  is click and go  yes  all right let's give it a shot  foot fist way  the trailer  all right hold on  let's turn this off  because right now  you're sucking  last august a film  was slipped to will ferrell  and adam mckay  do you think y'all  can handle this  yes sir  taekwondo's  a deadly serious  killing system  since then  they have watched it  at least 20 times 
[01:46:30]  it's the best of all  martial arts  i hear jiu-jitsu  is really good for balance  no jiu-jitsu sucks  they quote it  you're just a man  who is overweight  and has breasts  the size of a female  they obsess over it  you like to party  i'll give you a call  mr simmons  i really need to go  practice my film  wow  you just feel that  what  i mean we totally  just connected right there  and now they want to share it  i'm noticing that a lot  of y'all are just throwing 
[01:47:00]  single kicks and punches  what you need to be doing  is following those through  with some combinations  block with the right  distracting back fist  and spin cresting kick  got you didn't you rick  no i was just doing  what you told me to do  i think marge and i  know different  don't we marge  yes sir  you come with whatever  you got  full contact  i don't think you're  gonna like how this  ends hot shot  we just knocked out  the old lady  holy shit  holy shit  she's still alive 
[01:47:30]  yeah  the trailer would have  been more enjoyable  but they put that  stupid movie music  in there  like they keep  stopping the sound  yeah but the red  band trailer is better  because it has  cussing and everything  in it  oh i don't like  cussing  has cussing  has cussing  but they show  more of it  here's a question  i would like to ask 
[01:48:00]  roland  yeah  just look in the  camera too  what is your  favorite curse  roland what's that  about come on  oh that was  it is so ridiculous  people out there  are gonna think  that you're putting  it  no he's not  it's when i was a  kid my brother  used to torture me  just kind of so  ticklish and just  kill me to death  i stand in the  same way  but you still have  the laugh as in a  belt that you had  when you were six  where are you  ticklish most  yeah i don't know  just around  i just i'm ticklish  your arms ticklish  no  your nipples 
[01:48:30]  just my stomach area  is like ticklish  i don't know why  yeah  oh my god  master poe just  got my heart  oh my god  poe gave her a lot  of good tickling  it's the cutest  sound ever  it really is  you might just  hold him  and hold him  i know  then you realize  he's a sweaty  pederast  and then you  prefer not to  look at him  sweat  no it's awful  it'd be funny  if every time 
[01:49:00]  someone tickled  him he came  sounds like  he might be  uh trailer  sucks movie  is awesome  i don't really  know what to  think of  foot fist way  it might be  like a  napoleon dynamite  it gets better  the more you  watch it or  something  it does  i saw it  five times  already  five times  five  yeah  all right  well roll  that's like  what crazy  people do  uh  watch a movie  that many  times  don't hurt  him  yeah he's  away from  the mic  no need 
[01:49:30]  to do it  once he's  away from  the mic  wow  oh yeah  oh that  that little  laugh was  fucking  masquerading  a killer  inside  i know  roland doesn't  play  no  roland  you think  he's  phones  at po  god  may the  crane fall  on your  head  and kill  all your  wow  wow  let me tell you  something about  roland  he looks  like  oh  what's  this world  coming to  you gotta  take that  shit from  him  he just  threw a  water bottle

[01:50:30]  he fucking  poked me  around inside  my chest  this is  why  by the  way  it's a stunt  that went  too far  jimmy  stupid  that's why  oh shit  when i tickle  roland  look at his  eyes  they start  spitting  roland's  relentless  he'll fuck  himself  roland has  two emotions  is it still  dead  this is the  best  transformation 
[01:51:00]  i have  ever seen  oh my god  i should be  in a movie  my condolences  yeah  no  if i hurt  you i apologize  seriously  that's very  he's doing  this xm for  his email  so he'll  look good  no no  i don't  i don't  care about  that  i'm  sure  okay  okay  okay  all right  i'm  roland is  so pissed  holy  shit  your dog  still dead  roland's  brutal  holy shit  you know how  much he  loved that  dog  i just  want to 
[01:51:30]  bring  everyone  up to  speed  i'm  breaking  your  balls  and  you  better  me  get  your  fucking  face  still one  of the  best  heavies  ever  oh  yeah  billy  bats  rule  oh  even in  the  sopranos  man  oh  i was  watching  last  season  i was  crying  yeah  how much  he hated  that  fag  vito  god damn  the jokes  he was  making  and his  wife goes  to him  and they're  at breakfast  his wife  goes  remember  vito  accompanied  his wife 
[01:52:00]  when they  sang  silent  night  holy  night  last  christmas  phil  looks  at  his  wife  and goes  i gotta  try  to take  a  shit  i gotta  try  to take  a  shit  holy  shit  is he  great  i love  you  i love  you  joney  moron has  two emotions  cherub  and  fucking  throat  slasher  but that's  why by the  way 
[01:52:30]  you guys  can't  see  when i  tickle  roland  because the tickling goes two ways.  It's giggly and cute and then rage.  I don't like to be tickled.  I can take it for a couple of seconds.  So I gently sweep Roland's sides  so he can just move.  Exactly.  I was doing like mixed martial arts tickling.  No, he was just grabbing like a fucking...  He's behind F.H. Riley's grabbing a woman.  That's what I see what he was doing.  Oh!  That's what I hear. 
[01:53:00]  Holy shit!  I've heard rumors about...  I'm just reading in the paper.  I don't know if it's true.  We've heard rumors about what...  Wow!  And they're doing construction behind F.H. Riley  so Master Poe must be really bummed out.  Know where to go with his dates.  Ah, yeah.  I don't know where to take my dates, gentlemen.  Wow, Poe.  Poe's getting slammed.  Yeah.  Roland doesn't play.  No, he doesn't.  All right.  And the temperature's up to 87 now 
[01:53:30]  because you brought the heat, Roland.  I know.  Just see.  Release the inner beast.  Look, he's back to Cherub.  And his eyes are now back focusing on us.  They go to another place.  They really do.  You're not mad at me for starting, though, are you?  No.  You're just fine.  You're just an idiot over there.  You really don't like Master Poe?  No, it's not.  I don't like him.  I like him.  It's just when someone fucking jabs their fingers down my chest.  I don't like them at that moment.  Were you picked on as a boy? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  You fought that?  Aw.  Well, before I never fought, then I started fighting back.  Yeah, he started kicking some ass.  I had no idea.  But that day with Eastside Dave, when it got really real?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It reminded me what just happened there of, you know, there's something about Mary when  the retard, every time he touched him behind his ear.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Remember?  Fuck.  Not that you retire, Roland.  I didn't mean that.  But the reaction was like, you know, giggling little funny guy.  You motherfucker.  Roland's deceptive.  You look at Roland.  But Roland's probably strong like a little bull. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, of course.  Like Roland's probably a powerful, a lot of fucking low center of gravity squat little fucker.  Well, you can tell from his laugh.  Of course.  Yeah.  Powerful guy.  Has your blackberry shorted out from sweating on it?  I hope that thing's good to 50 fathoms.  On the way, the hosts, staff, and the guests of the Opie and Anthony show dish out and take  even more verbal abuse as the worst of Opie and Anthony's spitting wheel of hate continues. 
[01:55:00]  Welcome back.  The vicious verbal beatdown keeps a-comin'.  The worst of Opie and Anthony presents the spitting wheel of hate.  Welcome back to the spitting wheel of hate.  I'm your host, Roland.  Time to spin the wheel again.  Jeez.  And see who their next victim is.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Oh, Samuel.  That's what his mom calls him, I think. 
[01:55:30]  If I was his mom, I would call you Samuel.  No.  No?  I'm an ass in.  Sam gets thrown under the bus during Jocktober segment.  Gone wrong.  Enjoy!  Exclamation point is right there.  The spitting wheel of hate.  A freak show.  Hi, sirs.  Hi, guys.  We want to apologize from the bottom of our hearts, sir.  Profusely.  Profusely.  Sam's an idiot.  I don't.  I'm not apologizing.  Oh, Sam's the tough guy now. 
[01:56:00]  Telephone tough guy.  I'm not a tough guy.  I'm doing my job.  Sam is supposed to find shows that suck.  Right.  And we're listening to your stuff, and it's like, these guys are good.  We don't understand why he chose your show for Jocktober.  Freak show.  I got to tell you, we're hearing nothing but a perfect radio show so far.  Good breaks.  Sam just got lazy because he thought we were a top 40 morning show.  And just thought, oh, they're instantly a morning, you know, wacky zoo and have a wacky joke morning. 
[01:56:30]  Yep.  I listened to three hours of your show yesterday.  You didn't even know they were the guys that wrote the song for us, the jingle.  They didn't mention that yesterday.  We didn't have a girl that sits in the corner and laughs, Sam.  We're doing an easy target.  Where's the girl?  Yeah, yeah.  Where's the girl, Sam?  They're not an easy target because I don't go for the easy targets.  I go for variety.  I go for true radio flaws.  You got lazy and you're just picking shows now.  No, I'm not picking shows. 
[01:57:00]  And you got caught.  Your show was nominated by many virus fans.  By the way, guys, the guy that's making fun of you, Sam Roberts, is wearing a Lady Gaga t-shirt today.  I'm a fan.  Terrific, Sam.  But I don't have to sing a song about it.  She sings the song.  It's not me.  We got to get a little bit of Sam's does good radio.  Where's a bit of Sam's break?  Yeah, why don't we play Sam's radio show?  You want to hear a little Sam?  It's burning right now.  We're getting on.  Sam, what's yours for Sam?  We'll have it in a second.  We're burning it for you.  But Sam does good radio.  We should burn every copy of every friggin' minute that he's ever done. 
[01:57:30]  To CDs.  These guys refuse to do radio with a hole, Sam.  They don't refuse.  They just haven't been told to yet.  Oh.  If they were told to, they would do it.  Freak show.  Yes.  Actually, no, Sam.  Actually, there was one day they put a girl in here, and we just made her so uncomfortable  that they just decided not to have a girl.  See?  Yeah, she was uncomfortable because she appreciates funny radio, and your show made her uncomfortable.  Now, mention Pittsburgh.  Keep it local. 
[01:58:00]  What's wrong with going local with the radio?  That's perfect.  There's no way you're defending a satellite radio.  In Pittsburgh, why wouldn't they be local?  You're not supposed to talk about it.  They're forcing it.  They're singing songs about Mario Lemieux.  These guys grew up in Pittsburgh.  I can tell by their voices, Sam.  They probably didn't.  They probably didn't.  They did.  Where did you grow up?  We're actually originally from Detroit, but we-  Detroit.  And now all of a sudden-  Jesus, Freak show.  I was trying to help you out.  Put your pirate's hat on.  That was a great set up there.  I was trying to help you guys out.  Exactly.  Put your pirate's hat on and memorize the street maps. 
[01:58:30]  So the first day on the air, you had to have all those fun facts about Pittsburgh in front  of you, so you sounded like you knew what you were talking about, right?  Yeah, we came on and we're just like, hello, yins, pirates, and penguins.  Go, local sports teams.  See, this is funny, Sam.  They're cracking us up.  Yeah, it's funny now because they're being honest.  They're off the cuff.  They're funny, too.  On the radio, they have to actually act like they like these things.  They're singing songs about Mario Lemieux and bugs.  Like you?  Plugging your fucking, or your effing, if you're on the air. 
[01:59:00]  Are we on the air down there?  Of course we're not on the air.  They don't have the balls to put Opie and Anthony on their show.  No, they're not stupid enough to get fired like that.  Right.  We would have just got them fired, so they made the right choice there, too, Sam.  You are putting on a fake voice when you do your stupid radio show.  My voice is...  No.  We do have fake radio voices.  Does Sam use a fake voice?  Sam uses the worst fake voice you would ever hear.  It's been toned down since you originally heard it.  Oh, stop.  We want the older stuff.  The Bernie's still...  What, is it on a mimeograph? 
[01:59:30]  Where the fuck is it?  I don't know.  Yeah, what are you doing here?  Indian Queens wants Sam to be raped by a Lady Gaga CD.  Oh, that would be great.  Would you do that for the show, Sam?  Sideways.  Rape by a CD?  Sideways.  Sideways.  In the case?  Yeah, in the case.  In the jewel case.  You're a mess.  You're getting lazy.  You're just picking shows now without listening.  I listened to three hours of this show before I picked it.  Freak Show, we're very embarrassed today.  I listened to two shows yesterday, and the Freak Show was worse than the other show I listened 
[02:00:00]  to.  Yeah, we're all believing that, Sam.  That's terrific.  Who else did you listen to here?  Yeah, what was the other choice?  Come on.  Yeah, what was the other choice in Pittsburgh, Sam?  I listened...  It wasn't in Pittsburgh.  It was in Nebraska.  Oh, you're telling me our show in Nebraska, we are worse than them?  That's right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I'm telling you.  You're worse than them.  At least it was Mario Lemieux's freaking birthday here yet.  Yeah.  What was going on in Nebraska?  That was so awesome, Sam.  Your story's become a bit much, Sam.  Why didn't Nebraska make the cut and these guys did, Sam? 
[02:00:30]  That was embarrassing.  The secret to surviving Jocktober is if you have a show that literally does absolutely  nothing...  You're safe?  You're safe, because I can't pull clips from that.  There's nothing to talk about.  Oh.  But if you're like the freak show who puts on dumb bits...  As soon as I hear dumb bits and songs, you're in.  You're in.  Dumb bits.  Yes.  Like the Office Monkeys and the Bed Bugs song or whatever song you...  We like the Office Monkeys.  I don't know, Sam.  I usually go with you, but I think these guys are good.  You thought Office Monkeys was edgy?  Edgy?  The writing was good? 
[02:01:00]  Sorry they're not plugging their Twitter every break like Sam Roberts does on his dumb show.  I'm sorry we didn't do War of the Roses for you, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  I don't do War of the Roses.  Yeah, you do.  You might as well.  War of the Roses.  Maybe we'll get a phone scam on for you, Sam.  I don't do those things.  I work for this show.  I don't do those things.  Hold on.  Sam, here we go.  I'm right back at you.  See? 
[02:01:30]  We're in good company, Sam.  I know.  We both have horns.  But I'm not insulted by those things.  You want to do Battle of the Sexes, Sam?  And honk your breasts, Sam.  Big Bob has breasts, not me.  And the only reason I even know your name is because it's written down in front of me.  You know my name.  And I don't know the fact that you did a standard fat joke, Sam.  They are ripping you apart. 
[02:02:00]  They are ripping me apart.  You know why?  Because they know who I am just off the top of their heads.  He's going to sit on you.  Oh, terrific.  Yeah, he's going to sit on you, Sam.  They know exactly who I am.  Because he's fat.  Don't make it funny you just going after the fat, easy target.  You stink, Sam.  Yeah.  We're Sam's radio voice.  You got it?  It's coming.  We have to get it out of one system and put it on us.  Oh, that makes sense.  Maybe the freak show could review special delivery on their show.  Special delivery?  You can review it.  Oh, that'd be great.  You get jealous.  That's a great idea.  Did you just make fat jokes all day, Sam? 
[02:02:30]  No, I made one fat joke.  He's a cyber bully, guys.  He's a cyber bully.  Watch out for Sam Roberts.  He really is.  He really is.  We're going to play one of Sam's breaks for you if you guys have a minute.  And maybe it's good.  I like Sam, so maybe it's a great break.  Thank you very much.  You're welcome.  It could be an excellent break.  Maybe we'll be fair.  I'll bet it will be.  I'll bet they'll go through my show from last night and find the very best break.  Not last night.  We're going to go...  Don't we have older ones we used to play?  Yeah, we're going to go right to his first show where he was really nervous.  Oh, great.  Perfect.  I didn't know his place. 
[02:03:00]  Where are the ones we were playing that one time?  You prefer those.  I want you to jump off the George Washington Bridge after this is all over.  Yes, please.  Well, I'm not because Big Bob knows my name and that makes me more famous than him.  You know, if you're a cyber bully and if you jumped off a bridge, then you could solve the whole cyber bullying epidemic, Sam.  I'm not going to jump off the bridge.  I think cyber bullying should be stopped.  I'm a big time cyber bully and then you jump.  I'm not...  This is uncomfortable.  This isn't going good, Sam.  It's going just fine, thank you. 
[02:03:30]  And I'm going to keep living because I'm every month, every day...  Don't fool me!  To living.  To living.  Every day this month I'll be bringing a show.  Oh, sound effect, Sam.  Isn't that bad?  No.  Not in this context.  Oh, here comes E-Rock.  Why run down the hall when these guys got to go back on the radio any moment?  Look at E-Rock just trotting and plodding down the hallway.  What do you got there, E-Rock?  These were the early ones.  All right.  We're going to listen to some Sam Roberts.  Guys, strap in, by the way.  Strap in, guys.  And I'm doing Sam...  It's real funny. 
[02:04:00]  I'm doing Sam a favor.  This is from last night's show.  No, I don't think it is from last night's show.  It says it right here.  Last night's show.  All right.  Well, I mean, if it says it...  Guys, you ready for this?  Yeah.  We got the joke horn ready.  All right.  I heard that.  Coming up in the next 20 minutes, Kevin Rudolph.  Adam Lambert.  What do you want from me?  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  Never mind. 
[02:04:30]  Serious.  XM.  Satellite Radio.  Y'all get it.  Definitely wasn't last night.  Definitely wasn't last night.  You just said...  You sound like a progeria kid.  I understand, but it wasn't last night.  Hey, here I go.  Adam Lambert.  Adam Lambert.  I want to go to a Yankee game.  It's a learning process.  I'm over here, Maury.  I'm over here, Maury.  That's not funny.  That's not funny.  Yes, it is.  They did...  Anthony, they did your impression, but with a bad voice.  That's funny.  That's called a tag, Sam.  But they just did what Anthony said.  They got a laugh. 
[02:05:00]  It's a tag.  Exactly.  They're just doing show jokes, and they have their own show.  They're doing jokes from this show.  That was a hide-and-seek progeria.  Primordial dwarf Sam voice.  Maury Povich joke.  You sound like the kid from Glee.  Oh, that was terrible.  More Sam Roberts.  That's not from last night.  More Sam Roberts freak show.  That's not from last night.  Sirius XM Hits 1.  I'm Sam Roberts, and I'm starting to believe that Kesha is not nearly as grimy as she'd  like us to believe she is.  Wake up in the morning feeling like that.  What the hell does that mean?  What does that mean?  I don't remember. 
[02:05:30]  It was written months ago.  What does it mean?  Explain it.  Explain it.  I can't.  I don't remember.  I don't remember what I meant when I wrote it.  If it was funny or relevant, you would know right now.  I would submit my own air checks for Jocktober, but it seems self-indulgent.  Hey, why don't you just queue that up for next week?  Because you've failed this week, obviously.  Oh!  See?  You stink.  Oh, my God.  Look, they're coming in in droves now.  What does Troy got?  Troy's got some more.  Sam Roberts? 
[02:06:00]  Time?  No, he doesn't.  No.  Does the CD not work or something?  No.  That really is a nice taste of it.  It's just a duplicate.  It's so terrible.  I like your teasing of the hot hits that are coming up.  You are getting smunked.  And here's what's great.  Insert song hook here.  Yeah.  Teasing hot hits, boo.  You suck.  How great is it that Jocktober has turned on Sam?  Jocktober completely turned on you. 
[02:06:30]  Insert song hook here.  Well, why don't we try another one, guys?  No, there's no reason to.  Let's be more trying.  They're old breaks.  Sirius XM Hits 1, I'm Sam Robertson.  Date Night is the number one comedy movie in America.  It's not anymore.  Who would have thought that pairing Tina Fey with Steve Carell would be a success?  Of all the people, those guys running Hollywood must be geniuses, I tell you.  All of them geniuses.  Let me know what they'll think of next by Twittering me at twitter.com slash not Sam. 
[02:07:00]  And he hit the post.  Boy, you've got to hit the post.  I want the freak show.  Freak show, what did you think of that?  That was a terrific hit on the post.  Twitter me.  I stop talking when the words come in.  I'm saying.  But they hit post too.  You're like right out everything.  So, all right, I've got to finish this.  I've got to finish this in 20 seconds.  Yeah, he knows exactly how many seconds he's got.  It's a professional.  He faces his words out. 
[02:07:30]  You suck, Sam.  I don't agree.  Yeah.  That was terrible.  And you sounded like you were reading.  Yeah.  Well, that's because it was the first time I had done it.  Oh, stop.  It wasn't Date Night.  What?  Talk to Date Night.  Date Night just came out.  I just talked about Date Night on the radio yesterday, Sam.  You watched it on DVD.  So you must be talking about the DVD.  Number one DVD in America.  I can't apologize enough for stupid Sam getting lazy with Jocktober.  And just pick shows out of a hat.  You can squeeze your nuts when you start talking.  Oh, wow. 
[02:08:00]  Hi, boys.  Well, I'm glad they don't go for easy jokes.  Squeeze your nuts.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  That's not an easy joke.  That was clever, Sam.  Tell the freak show to stick to Ant's jokes.  Hard to believe that that...  Here's my Twitter.  I'm over here, Maury.  That's the same one you did before, and it was Ant's joke before.  Going back again, Sam.  That's the same joke.  Please, I'm up to 65 followers.  I have more followers than the freak show, I'll bet.  Oh, please.  All right, gentlemen, we got to get going.  Yeah, I'll bet you do.  See you, guys.  Well, we're going to listen to Sam instead of you guys. 
[02:08:30]  Why?  That's not even current.  This just turned into Samtober.  It was a complete misdiagnosis by Sam.  You didn't even hear the Mario Lemieux song.  We apologize, gentlemen.  We're fans of the show, boys.  Thanks.  Thank you.  As are we of you.  That's right.  Big fans of the freak show in Pittsburgh.  Yeah, not all of us.  Thank you, freak show.  All right, guys.  There they go.  All right, in all fairness, we'll listen to the Mario Lemieux song.  Listen to the Mario Lemieux song.  Let's see if they hit the post.  In all fairness.  Because that's what I did when I first started, not yesterday. 
[02:09:00]  This is what they did yesterday.  All right.  I love how they were ragging you with these shit songs and hitting the post.  That's what they do.  I'm Sam Roberts, and bleh, I'm Kesha, and I'm fucking, ugh.  Ears up.  Kesha.  Here's the freak show doing their Mario Lemieux birthday song.  All right.  Sirius XM hits one.  I'm Sam Roberts, and rumor has it that Elin is officially going to file for divorce from  Tiger Woods.  Come on, Elin.  Will you give the guy a break? 
[02:09:30]  What did Tiger ever do to you?  Really?  Hit me up on Twitter, twitter.com slash notsam.  Oh, enough with your fucking Twitter.  Why are you doing old news stories?  Why?  I'm not.  I think they're officially divorced.  What's wrong with you?  They were divorced a long time ago, like when that first aired.  Open up the fucking paper, man.  And what's with the, what did he ever do to you?  Like, what do you mean by that?  He cheated.  Everybody knows that.  Well, that's the joke.  Wait, where's the joke?  What's the joke?  It's the joke with all the humor parts removed.  Yeah.  Had a humorectomy.  That joke.  It's an obvious question.  Yeah? 
[02:10:00]  But, like, I'm like, what did he ever do to you?  No, you were like, what did he ever do to you?  I know.  Hit me up.  Hit me up on Twitter.  Oh, God.  What are you doing?  Fucking junior high?  Ah, junior high.  That's, that's, I mean, I mean, it's funny, but it's not accurate.  Hit me up.  All right.  Why don't we go back to the freak show?  Yeah.  Why don't we?  Mario Lemieux, birthday, a little song action.  Yeah, Mario Lemieux.  It's the Mario Lemieux song.  I like to.  All right.  Sirius XM Hits 1, I'm Sam Roberts, and in what alternate dimension is Rude Boy considered 
[02:10:30]  a compliment?  Wait, what if this is the alternate dimension?  Oh, my head.  Come on, Rude Boy, boy, can you get in?  Oh, God.  You have no fucking right to pick any shows to goof on.  And this is last night's show.  It's not last night's show.  So you've settled in at this point.  Somebody I know was driving around in their car, listening to Hits 1, and the passenger  said, oh, who is this? 
[02:11:00]  They're so lame.  Oh, shit.  Not knowing.  And it was Sam on the radio, and the passenger was a 14-year-old girl.  So the driver was answering.  That 14-year-old girl should not have been up overnight.  You tell them, Sam.  They have some irresponsible parents.  It's obviously the 14-year-old has bad judgments, and she was up at 4 o'clock in the morning.  I'm not sure.  Oh, my head.  Oh, my head. 
[02:11:30]  What acting?  What's your Twitter name?  Nana?  How fucking old are you?  Nana.  He talks like a cartoon character.  And we definitely played that break the first time we did this.  No, we didn't, Sam.  Because you already made fun of me for doing that break.  Sam, stop with your lies.  It's terrible.  Look, you get the point.  So we'll move back into Jocktober.  It's the morning free show with Big Bob and Mikey on Kiss 96.1 in Pittsburgh.  Let's see.  Mario Lemieux, the birthday song.  Yes.  That you didn't like.  I thought I was lying.  Sirius XM hits one. 
[02:12:00]  I'm Sam Roberts, and Lady Gaga has come out and said that she's celibate.  Do you think that includes both men and women?  Let me know on my Twitter, twitter.com slash notsam.  Hello, hello, baby.  Why would the Twitter every fucking break?  Who's going to Twitter your answer?  Yes, I agree.  Oh, yes, Sam.  Men or women.  Listen.  Stop trying to get a buzz started.  It's not going to start chatter.  What are you doing with the Twitter plugs?  I'm not doing. 
[02:12:30]  What was it?  What was it?  You're doing with the Twitter plugs.  Was.  Sam's attempting a BuzzFeed.  Oh, he's trying really hard to fucking start chatter.  He wants to be trending.  Do you ever go to that site, BuzzFeed?  Yeah, BuzzFeed's pretty good.  That's, uh, that's, uh.  Yeah, I know, I know.  Oh.  Do you want to say?  No.  Okay.  I know, though.  Well, Sam Roberts.  This is something that was.  Baby Gaga said she's celibate.  All right, well.  Again, was.  This is not current.  Ah.  Hey, you guys.  Not good either.  Hey, you like jokes?  I love jokes. 
[02:13:00]  I love jokes.  Jimmy, you like jokes?  I love a good joke, Hope.  I like jokes.  Sam, do you like jokes?  No, I like Mario Lemieux songs.  Well, I want to play a joke first, if you don't mind.  All right.  Is it okay that we do this on our show?  Sure show.  You can do it.  Sirius XM Hits 1.  I'm Sam Roberts.  It's GE is putting out a light bulb that costs $50 but lasts for 17 years.  What happens if it breaks?  That's funny.  No, it's not.  I'd rather have that light bulb put in my asshole and broken than hear another one of these breaks. 
[02:13:30]  Who on the breaks?  It's a $50 light bulb.  How much?  It's a bad investment if it breaks.  Oh, look at what Creepy Craig says.  He goes, oh, my head is covered in pubes.  I don't have pubic.  Because your hair is like frizzy and fuzzy like pubic.  It doesn't make any sense.  In what dimension is Rude Boy a compliment?  Is that the fushizzle and the nizzle?  No, my head.  No. 
[02:14:00]  This is all way out of context.  Mr. Faber-Sham, my head hurts.  My head hurts.  Oh, God.  In what dimension?  We're losing focus.  You should get a job on WPU.  WPU.  Oh, God.  We're way losing focus.  We are not looking.  Fucking crystal clear.  Like a diamond bullet.  I've never been more focused.  You want us to focus? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You want us to focus?  I want to hear the song.  Sirius XM's one.  I'm Sam Robertson.  Sometimes songs don't need complicated lyrics.  For instance...  Hey, hey.  Hey, I'm in the house.  Hey.  Is that it?  That was your whole break?  He says, well, that's a very short break between songs, so you've got to keep it quick.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  You can just promote it to Twitter, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, why don't you just go...  Sam Roberts has a Twitter...  I was criticized for doing that.  Oh, you were?  By who?  By who?  By who?  When? 
[02:15:00]  By you.  You.  By who?  I don't remember that.  Wow.  Why are you making a Charlie Sheen joke last night?  I didn't make a Charlie Sheen joke last night.  Oh, that's a Charlie Sheen joke.  Oh, did you do a Charlie Sheen joke?  I don't remember.  It was too long ago.  Two and a half men joke?  Sirius XM hits one.  I'm Sam Roberts.  The press is saying Charlie Sheen is crazy for shaving his head.  Maybe he was just hot.  According to you...  That's funny.  That's clever.  It's neither of those things.  That is fucking nothing.  It's terrible.  Just a little quick thing.  You're just babbling.  I'd be embarrassed to think that alone, much less pick up a pen and write it. 
[02:15:30]  That's terrible.  That's like this.  It's like, I'm Sam Roberts and I have a cup in my hand.  Yeah.  Because I just picked up a cup.  Why don't you just do this?  Talk, talk, words, words, song.  Just say that.  Song soon.  Song soon, song now.  You have no right.  You guys want to hear a...  I'd love to.  Whatever it is. 
[02:16:00]  You want to hear a...  You're the pot calling your relatives black.  Oh, that's funny.  Leave the other shows alone.  You have no right.  Exactly.  Out of context.  October should be shows you aspire to be someday.  That's really good.  By the way, there's confusion when we suggested you get raped by a Lady Gaga CD.  Yeah.  I think you said sideways or something.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Someone on my Twitter said, no, full diameter.  Oh, wow.  Full diameter.  Like shove it in like full fucking diameter for you.  Right?  I don't want to do that.  Oh, wow.  That would hurt.  I don't want to do that.  Do we have another live read for everybody or in a minute or two?  Oh, my God.  It would be fantastic.  We could probably finish out the show with commercials if you really want.  See, then the listeners will really get pissed off.  They're already pissed off.  Is there any more audio?  Yeah.  This is terrific.  I know.  I really want to hear it.  The thing for the people out there is show you how a hits one DJ should sound. 
[02:17:00]  Okay.  If that makes sense.  Sure.  Okay.  You can learn from this, Sam.  I disagree.  Part of October is teaching the hack show how to be better.  That's right.  This is what you're doing to me?  Yes.  Well, come listen to your fucking show.  This completely turned on me.  Well, it was last night's show.  When you pick a fucking show.  It wasn't last night's show.  I mean, if it was one of your first shows when you were getting comfortable and you had  to get the nerves out, I would understand.  It was my second show that you just played.  Well, it says last night right there.  Then it's grossly mislabeled. 
[02:17:30]  Here's a hits one jock doing it properly.  The sound of Generation Now.  Coming up on the top of the hour, nothing to look forward to.  It's the same shit over and over again.  Because you got to be here for fag to listen to this station.  You got to be waiting alone for us to listen to this music. 
[02:18:00]  Sirius XM.  There's no way that that would fly on that show.  That's the way you do it, Sam.  There's no way that would fly on that station.  Had the voice down.  You should be proud that he's imitating your voice, at least.  He sucked in helium.  Oh, really?  Yes, he got a helium tank.  He likes your voice.  He just doesn't like what you're saying with it. 
[02:18:30]  The content of that would not fly at all on hits one.  Greg, I'd love to hear it.  You can hear the balloon.  Hi, I'm Club Soda Kenny on Sirius XM1.  Saving the right station.  Sade.  Why is that bitch back?  Nobody cared about her since 1984 in Smooth Operator.  That's funny.  I mean, he hit the post and everything.  But the record labels would be so upset. 
[02:19:00]  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  They should have a sense of humor.  They don't care as long as the music's being played.  Why should they give it a shit?  That's right.  They just want to sell records.  Concert tickets.  Do we have a...  You ain't doing it.  You want to hear more Club Soda Kenny?  Yes, I know.  Doing hits one the proper way?  I don't.  I also want to get a little more Sam.  I would like to hear the Mario Lemieux song.  It's a balloon.  Club Soda Kenny on Sirius XM Hits 1.  Selena Gomez is on a European tour. 
[02:19:30]  She's only 17 now.  That's legal in some states.  But on July 22nd, she'll be good to go.  Her song is Naturally.  Does that mean unclipped?  And then he goes, hmm, like primetime Sam Roberts.  He's learned well from you, Sam.  The content was off and the break was way too long.  No, it was entertaining.  It's supposed to be the music doesn't stop.  It's about the music.  It was called good. 
[02:20:00]  And he leaves you pondering.  No, he doesn't.  Where you sit there and go, yeah, I wonder if it's unclipped.  People are complaining, though, that Kenny is forgetting to give out his Twitter every break.  Yeah, I don't know why he's not doing that.  Because that's the Sam Roberts thing to do.  If Sam does it, Club Soda Kenny should be doing it.  I don't do it anymore.  You want to hear more Club Soda Kenny?  I did it my first day.  He just cursed over the end of the song. 
[02:20:30]  Can we take you inside the bit?  What the fuck are you doing?  Kenny didn't realize that the outro is kind of long, so he sucked in the helium a little too early.  And he goes, what the fuck are you doing?  This one is not an XL channel by any stretch of the imagination.  Then he's all mad at that fucking song.  With the lungs full of helium, he goes, what the fuck are you doing?  Because he knows he has to suck in more because he fucked up.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[02:21:00]  And the fucking song already.  Because my dreams are bursting out the sea.  Oh, my God.  Club Soda Kenny on Sirius XM Hits 1.  Hey, do you think Kelly Clarkson is fat?  I'll let you know after she sits on my face.  Who wouldn't listen to this?  That's a fucking break.  Who wouldn't listen to this? 
[02:21:30]  I would listen to that station.  They've got to play the same shit day in and day out, so why not have someone that's going to fuck around a little bit?  Oh, that's great.  People would be very offended by that break.  Offended?  Why offended?  I'm not entertained.  It's family programming.  I'm offended by your fucking breaks.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.  Sam, this is a brilliant suggestion.  Obviously, we all want you to kill yourself for the sake of the show.  Yeah, I don't like where this is going.  And SpyGuy925 on Twitter.  Sam's body should be drained of blood and cumed on by the entire Celtics team. 
[02:22:00]  Cumed on?  Well, I wouldn't know what was done with it after it was drained of blood.  All right, so you should be able to accept that.  But I'm not going to drain of blood, no.  Why?  Because then I would kill myself.  And that's not something I'm willing to do.  What's wrong with you?  I want to live a fruitful life.  I want to live.  Well, I guess the cyberbullying is going to continue then.  What are you going to do when this whole radio thing just doesn't pan out for you as it isn't?  Television.  What do you have planned?  Right?  Television?  You don't think so?  Good luck there. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  With that fucking head of hair, what are you going to do?  Are you going to be on a remake of Good Times?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you going to do?  Maybe they'll do a white remake of Good Times.  Well, then you'd be out.  Oh.  Because you're a black man.  Oh.  Anthony, Club Soda Kenny doing more hits one for everybody.  What for?  Doing it the proper way.  Incredible.  Hi, I'm Club Soda Kenny on Serious Hits One. 
[02:23:00]  That was Lady Antebellum.  She's hot.  You know what I don't do?  Kevin Rudolph or Adam Lambert.  I do Kesha because she knows how to blah, blah, blah on you know what.  That's a dick joke.  See, he's doing dick jokes.  That's good.  He's doing dick jokes and getting away with it.  Very good.  And the song is called Blah, Blah, Blah.  So that's funny, man.  That was very clever on Club Soda Kenny.  It wasn't clever.  It was vulgar.  Extremely clever.  You know, Opie, I've got to tell you something.  What?  I hate Sam's show. 
[02:23:30]  Oh.  I hate him.  Come on.  That's too bad.  As we continue here, Club Soda Kenny doing some hits one for everybody.  What for?  Uh-huh.  Because we're teaching you how to do this properly.  There's no way this should pass.  You need to be cursing a little bit.  You need to be doing some dick jokes.  Yep.  I can't do either of those two things.  You need to show your disgust for the music.  I'm not going to do any of those three.  You need to do the same fucking songs every night, so show some disgust.  I'm not going to do any of those things.  This is how Kenny does it.  I like the songs.  This is how Kenny does it. 
[02:24:00]  Hi, Club Soda Kenny on Series XM Hits 1.  Do you know who was influenced by David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, and Michael Jackson?  Listen, if you answered a bunch of queers, you might be right.  But according to Wikipedia, it's Lady Gaga.  That's funny.  Telephone.  That's funny.  Who wouldn't listen to that, Sam Roberts?  That's funny. 
[02:24:30]  People would listen, but they'd also be outraged.  Outraged?  He used a slur.  At laughing?  They'd be outraged at laughing?  No, they'd be outraged at the slur used to describe people.  Sam, no one would be outraged by that at all.  We are free!  Find out who gets annihilated next as the Worst of Opie and Anthony's Spinning Wheel of Hate continues.  Welcome back to the Worst of Opie and Anthony presents the Spinning Wheel of Hate. 
[02:25:00]  And now, here's your host, Roland.  Welcome back to Spinning Wheel of Hate.  I'm your host, Roland.  You know, time to spin the wheel again.  And we see who our next victim is.  Opie.  Opie!  I'm not doing this one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he was supposed to say that.  Oh, this one's a baby diaper mustache. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, I don't know.  The best thing about Voss is he brought his baby poo-poo for Opie.  The Spinning Wheel of Hate.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is he doing here?  Oh, my God.  Please.  Oh, no!  All right.  I know what the fuck he did.  I know what the fuck he did.  My heart just stopped.  Yes, and it should.  Do you have Bonnie and the baby?  First of all, I always have a heart of Bonnie and the baby with me, whether they're here 
[02:26:00]  or not.  Okay?  So, what are you saying?  Do I have Bonnie?  Do you see Bonnie with me, stupid?  Oh, I'm breathing.  Do you understand?  I would love fucking...  You have no idea.  Do you understand?  What?  You have no idea, do you, stupid?  Holy crap.  He has no clue.  What?  My heart...  I'm not even joking.  Just stopped.  What's that?  Can you please play it for him?  Oh, God.  All right.  I'll play this for you.  It's very obvious he has no clue, and I'm off the hook.  Holy shit, I saw your face.  I was so happy to see you for the first time ever.  You know how you were so surprised when we surprised you with Chaz Palmitary? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  I just had that same look on my face when I saw you at the door, but you have no idea.  Oh, thank God.  Listen to this.  Oh, God.  Bonnie's not here, right?  No.  All right, good.  Listen to this.  It's Baby Diaper Mustache Day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Have you overlooked at your baby's diaper and thought, hmm, that belongs on a man's face?  Do you have a stinky baby?  Do you want to see Opie wear a baby shit mustache?  Hurry, because you have less than two hours to get you and your stinky baby to the Opie and Anthony Show Studios. 
[02:27:00]  That's right.  Show up here with your little rat, and Opie will personally apply a heaping helping of your baby's green shit to his upper lip.  This promotion ends at exactly 11 a.m.  So if you and your shit-steak and baby show up at 11.01, you can go the fuck home.  Baby must be yours.  Shit must be baby's.  Baby must shit in presence of Opie.  Diaper must be clean prior to baby shitting.  This offer is null and void at the end of today's live broadcast.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm breathing now.  I saw your face like you just happened to be in town, maybe at a doctor's office or something. 
[02:27:30]  I'm like, holy shit, it's going down today.  So you're saying you would take baby shit?  Yeah, but here's the beauty, Rich.  I just surprised people out of nowhere.  It turns into baby diaper mustache day.  Today happens to be one of those days, and the odds of it actually happening are slim.  But when we saw your face at the door, I'm like, oh my fucking God.  Yeah, because he is somebody that would have been listening.  Because you have stopped by with the baby, too, before.  You know, here's the thing, though.  I mean, there's so many rules to this thing, you know.  The bottom line is you would take baby shit and put it under here. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Get the hell out of here.  You'd make a little mustache with baby shit.  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  It's green!  Fuck my audition!  Fuck you!  Fuck it, it's green!  You set me up!  Oh, it's fucking green!  Ah, Bobby's puking!  Bobby's puking!  Get him a pail!  Oh, shit, get him a pail! 
[02:28:30]  Oh, my God, Bobby's puking!  You fuking!  Oh, God damn it!  Oh, fucking Bobby's got the weakest...  Oh, Bobby's got the weakest stomach!  Does your baby have pus come out of its asshole?  You think if he's thinner, he throws up so much?  Yeah, oh, fuck!  Nice left.  Oh, my God! 
[02:29:00]  If you could do that after each meal, you'd maybe lose a few pounds.  Holy Jesus!  I don't care!  I'll fucking puke!  I want to see it on his lap!  Fuck all of you!  It's baby shit fucking Friday!  Dude, Opie did...  It's like the plane landed and everybody started to clap,  and then it fucking rolled over and exploded.  That's exactly it!  This is the best day of radio ever. 
[02:29:30]  Who fucking called you?  Because the beauty of this bit is I go,  Steve, make the problem.  I'm doing baby diaper mustache.  Don't tell anyone.  And then, wait, tack, Sam.  Then I play the thing,  and no one has enough time to come over here.  So, someone obviously called you and said,  get your ass into New York with some fucking baby shit.  Well, here's the thing.  No one...  Eric's idea!  No, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, wow.  No one called me.  I had to come in anyhow for some promos,  and I always keep a dirty diaper with me  just in case it's an emergency.  You know what?  Bobby can't take it. 
[02:30:00]  Bobby can't take it.  I just don't understand why it's green and white.  Yeah, why is it?  Why the multicolored...  What do you feed your baby?  Is it hard for you to puke like that  without opening a car door?  And he's on fire, too.  Fuck you, bro.  He's on fire.  That's the one thing that stinks.  He came in on fire.  He's been thinking the whole...  Tip it over.  Tip your baby shit over.  Dude, you fucking...  What?  And you're playing it cool. 
[02:30:30]  Like, what's going on?  You played it perfectly,  and then you fucking casually  take it out of your fucking jacket  and throw it on the counter.  It's all in.  Oh, God.  He touches it.  Oh, he's touching it, Bobby.  Look at his ass crack hanging out.  It's the lover's crack.  He's got his ass crack hanging out  as he's puking.  Oh, fuck.  Pull your pants up, you mess.  Oh, what a disaster you are.  I'm a disaster. 
[02:31:00]  Look at both of you.  Fucking Laszlo and both of you.  What?  Fucking awful.  I don't need gloves.  Fucking stock car racer bodies.  I'm sick of both of you.  You really are, you thin assholes.  Yeah.  Pitted.  So pitted.  Here we go.  Yeah, pitted.  So pitted.  Here we go.  Well, here.  Let's...  Here we go.  Let's be close.  Bye.  Here, you can.  Dude.  You're not using this audio  in this newspaper?  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you fucking asshole.  You just set yourself up  using this newspaper. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, God.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wow.  What are the odds  that I got to set you guys up?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  He's putting on surgical gloves.  Why are you putting on surgical gloves?  So he can handle...  What's wrong with your baby?  What's wrong with her?  He can handle the diaper.  Nothing.  I want to just fiddle through this myself.  All right.  Let me get over there.  Oh, God.  Fucking E-Rock.  Fuck.  E-Rock sold you out, motherfucker. 
[02:32:00]  Well, you don't have to come here.  We can bring it to you.  All right.  Bring it to me.  What's the hood going to do?  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  No fucking way.  Oh.  No fucking way.  No way.  Oh, Bobby's chicken is so fucking funny.  I don't know why. 
[02:32:30]  Everyone's saying the promo states  that it must be a clean diaper  and the baby has to shit into it in their studio.  You said you'd work around that.  You said you'd work around it.  I did.  Fair is fair.  Let's go.  Let's make a nice Yosemite sand.  Holy shit.  I just got my first whip.  Oh, oh.  Dude, you got to bring it.  What?  All right.  Bring it over here.  God damn.  Well, let me get it ready.  You better check your baby  for fucking eating a dead chicken or something.  I don't know what it fucking ate.  All right.  Open up the dice.  Let's see what's in there. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, Bobby, look.  It looks like...  It looks like he ate...  Oh, dog.  Oh, fuck.  It's like dinting more beef stew.  Oh, this is so disgusting.  What do you teach your baby?  It's so disgusting.  Dead birds?  Oh, look.  What is this shit supposed to look like?  Fucking roses, you asshole as shit?  Rich has been waiting for this day for fucking eight years. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, God.  Rich is you, kid.  How do you have a kid?  It's your kid.  How do you change it and puke?  Why is this affecting you?  It's your baby shit.  But it's different when I'm...  When it's coming out of its asshole?  Yeah, when I have clothes on.  Dave from Massachusetts.  Dave from Massachusetts.  To add insult to injury...  To add insult to baby shit injury,  Opie has to live with the fact that he got outsmarted by Voss. 
[02:34:00]  That's true.  That is bad.  And who?  And Iraq.  What the fuck?  What's with his head?  We're just using his afro for a pen holder.  We're having a really weird show.  It's a very sassy day.  Dude, what's in there, really?  What's in there?  Fucking crushed peas.  Some peaches and yams.  I love how diapers have cute little cartoon animals on them  because once they're used,  then they're just smeared with shit.  Yeah, now it looks like cute animals that got shit on.  They put that on there to make you feel guilty 
[02:34:30]  for what you're about to do.  You got gloves?  Yeah, right here.  It's wrong with you.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Bobby's puking again.  Oh, my God.  I got to go.  Why do you need gloves?  You're about to put shit on your face  and you're going to put plastic gloves on?  Oh, my God.  I am so puking. 
[02:35:00]  And I don't...  It takes a lot for me to puke.  See, sometimes babies...  Fucking fair.  Sometimes babies don't go to the bathroom for a whole day at a time.  So this could be, like, built up.  This is, like, a couple days of crap.  All right.  Let me see what you got.  A couple days.  Bring it over.  Bring it over.  Let's go.  You want me to go over there?  Let's go.  It's up to you.  I don't care.  All right.  Bring it over.  Excuse me.  You're a fucking man among men.  Bring it over. 
[02:35:30]  I give you fucking 100% credit.  Just stick it to your word.  It's not fair, though.  They set me up.  They know why I do this bit.  It's all about the timing of the thing.  Yeah.  This was never supposed to go down.  No.  Oh, my God.  My chair.  Just staring at shit sitting in a chair on a newspaper.  The quicker you do it, the quicker it's over.  Do you have baby wipes right near you?  Help.  You need baby wipes.  You can't just leave it on your face after that. 
[02:36:00]  Get him some wipes.  Get him a bucket of acid to stick his face in.  I'm hyperventilating.  Do it.  One, two, three.  Where is the diaper?  It's on the chair.  Is it in the chair?  All right.  You've got to face forward a little bit.  Here we go.  Hold your breath.  Okay.  Don't smell.  There you go.  Don't smell.  It's not a big deal.  It's like food only, you know, in the second stage.  And it came out of Voss's kid's asshole.  Food in the second stage is called shit, Rich.  What's the good part? 
[02:36:30]  What's the good part?  The green part.  You're not Bobby Kelly.  He's on fire.  You've got to give it to him.  That's pretty good.  But you know it's coming.  He's going to bomb any second now.  You know it's happening.  How the fuck am I going to do this?  You're going to stick your fingers in there and do it quick.  Oh, it's a Sesame Street diaper.  It's a cookie monster.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What's supposed to be?  Oh, my God.  What do you want on a diaper?  Look at that part.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's so fucking funny. 
[02:37:00]  You braze on the golf course?  It's unbelievable.  You can take an eight-inch cock in your mouth, but you can look at that and you're puking  like a maniac.  Eight-inch cock is fucking soft and smells nice.  Let's clean up for you.  Oh, my God. 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  Okay, I saved you on that joke.  Hurry up.  I got to get your diaper back.  All right.  What are we going for?  I say a big wad on your finger.  I didn't fucking shave today either.  God damn it.  Oh, man.  It's going to be stuck in there.  I got to go.  What do you got an audition for?  I'm fucking.  I don't care.  Fucking go.  It's not.  It's a callback.  Cool.  I know you never heard of one of those.  Oh, shit.  It's definitely not with a girl, is it?  Yes.  I knew it, cump.  See you, Bob.  You're really just a fucking greedy asshole. 
[02:38:00]  You really are.  You and your fucking extra large polo shirt.  Just do it, O.  Do it.  Man up.  Ready?  Here we go.  Two fingers, each side.  Fucking nice little mustache.  Oh, my God, Mel.  One, two, three.  Ready?  This is so fucking disgusting.  One, two, three.  This is a new law.  Do it.  A new fucking law.  Fuck, do it.  Travis, move your head.  Do it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:38:30]  Thank you, Travis.  One, two.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is called baby diaper mustache.  Oh, my God.  One, two, three.  Do two fingers at a time.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  He's got it on his finger.  He's got some.  He's smearing.  He's got.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I see YouTube sensation right now.  This is going to be a YouTube sensation. 
[02:39:00]  Did you say robertkellylive.com right after you do it?  That is fucking disgusting.  All right.  This is called.  Oh, it stinks.  Once again, this is called baby diaper mustache.  One, two, three.  One, two, three.  Oh.  One, two, three, dude.  Oh, man.  Oh, no. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I've got to get it off.  He fell on the floor.  He fell on the floor.  He did it.  He took two fingers, wiped it right under his nose.  Now he can't get the smell out of his head. 
[02:40:00]  Oh.  He's got the diaper in his hand.  I didn't do it.  Where is he?  He's going.  All right.  He's running off to the bathroom.  Holy shit.  What a fucking prop act.  I'll see you guys later.  Take it easy, Bobby.  Thanks, man.  Oh, my God.  He's got tears.  Boss, I fucking love you.  I fucking love you. 
[02:40:30]  I really didn't think he'd do that.  I fucking love Laz.  I'll see you later.  I did not think he would do that.  This is the best show I've ever fucking done, ever.  I'll see you guys.  I'm going to puke.  Because Opie's rarely on the receiving end of any of that stuff.  Literally, that shit.  And to see him, actually, he took two fingers full on his index fingers and smeared it right  under his nose.  And the worst part is he hesitated.  He held his fingers right under his nose for a minute.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  And then kept going back and forth with him.  And then, after he finished throwing up, he tried to wipe it off.  And then he just had green shit smeared it.  And it went on his lip.  Like, now it was so close to his mouth.  And it was a big wide.  It wasn't just like...  Dude, that shit is green.  That baby shit was green.  Alien fucking green.  You guys called me one day and said...  Oh, what a picture.  That's it.  E-Rock's showing me a still picture.  There, Opie's horrified and just got baby shit smeared all under his nose. 
[02:41:30]  I am so disgusted.  A new low.  A brand new low on the Opie and Anthony show.  I didn't think it could be done.  When he picked up that diaper and ran around, I'm sure it was going to go in E-Rock's face.  Oh, yeah.  It should have.  Oh.  It's still in the garbage can.  You can still put it in E-Rock's face.  You look winded.  Dude.  Boss.  Boss, it's in the garbage pile if you want to put it with the rest of your act in a notebook 
[02:42:00]  or something.  Dude.  Let me tell you something.  Sorry, sir.  You watered down my joke from earlier.  Oh, I did?  Fuck.  Per usual, I wasn't listening to you.  Wow.  Boss comes through.  Let me tell you something.  All right.  Yeah.  Opie, please.  Describe it for the people.  What's it like to smear baby shit under your nose for really nothing?  Oh, my God.  Like, people would do that for a $10,000 bet, maybe.  Right?  Or ratings.  Like, you string it out over a few days over at K-Rock. 
[02:42:30]  Dude.  10 grand.  You smear baby shit under your nose.  Fuck you.  And you did it for the show.  Dude.  Oh, my God.  Get me a fucking razor immediately.  You need something.  No, dude.  I can't get it out of my Mustang.  Yeah?  I have never been.  You want the big baby shit?  No.  I need a razor.  I'm not even fucking kidding.  It's got four blades.  Don't kill yourself over it.  Dude.  I've never been more grossed out and sicker in my life. 
[02:43:00]  Wow.  I just fucking puked so much.  Go look at the toilet in the bathroom.  And I'm telling you, I'm one of these guys.  It takes a lot for me to puke.  There's a FedEx package here.  This was fast.  It's a diamond ring from Lindsay.  Thank God she's at yoga today.  Oh, you don't want to listen to Replay.  It was just a regular show today.  Yeah.  Dude, I fucking don't feel right.  It's called hepatitis.  Yeah, right? 
[02:43:30]  Has that kid been inoculated?  You went from like the top radio host in the country to an intern.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did.  You fucking, man.  You know what?  I'm a man of my word, though.  You can't now say he's not.  You guys outsmarted me, which is not easy, you fuckers.  Because I swear to God, I'll take you inside the thing completely.  I was like, there's no fucking way anyone will ever get to the studio in time.  So every once in a while, we'll throw this on the air like as a goof.  Baby diaper mustache.  Knowing there's no fucking way.  But these motherfuckers were in cahoots and outsmarted me. 
[02:44:00]  That doesn't happen.  It all just came together.  It certainly did.  And you played it perfectly.  Did you come in and get his first appearance?  I got it from the point when he was like, you realized that Bonnie wasn't here.  And then, you know, you guys were just talking and then he pulled the diaper out and you were  like, oh my God.  You had no clue I had a diaper on me?  No.  I thought it was off the hook.  Because when I saw your face, I'm like, oh shit, they're in town for a doctor's visit. 
[02:44:30]  You've done it before.  And then when you came in, you acted perfectly.  Like, what are you talking about?  And then when I set up the bid, like, oh, thank God I'm off the hook.  And you go, well, bam.  And you showed the diaper.  Can you cut where he just said you acted perfectly?  Can we get that anywhere on TV or something?  You acted.  The keyword would be acted perfectly.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know what?  Tell Chaz about that.  Next time you talk to Palomari or whatever his name is.  Where did Bobby go? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, he had to go to a little audition.  Callback or something.  But there's just something about Bobby vomiting.  That is the funniest fucking thing.  I will always laugh my ass off when Bob Kelly pukes.  It's the sound.  It's what he's puking at.  I used to think it was a bit, too, until you see it live.  No, no.  You can actually see him convulsing physically.  His whole head turns beet red.  You see how his audience feels?  Can we take a break? 
[02:45:30]  I need to...  Yeah, we'll take a break.  You probably should scrub under there.  Maybe lemons or something.  Dude, I'm getting sick all over again because it's in my mustache.  Not that I have a mustache.  I didn't shave the last three days.  You got a little stubble?  It's even worse because it's easier to get caught in stubble than a mustache.  You just wipe it out of your mustache.  It's going to be great in the year.  In a few days when he has chicken pox.  All the baby diseases.  You're going to have baby diseases.  The mumps.  Oh, he'll have all the baby diseases.  Rubella.  You have rubella.  You have a little balloon following you. 
[02:46:00]  Wow, that was an old one.  Jesus Christ.  Why don't you just go back to polio, you fucking fossil?  Like when I can make old jokes.  Two minutes ago, I was a king.  Yeah.  That's how this place works.  One minute you're a king, the next you got baby shit under your nose.  I don't even know what you guys said.  I am so fucking out of it right now.  Well, I guess you should be.  Because I got all hyped out.  The adrenaline and everything.  You know, if you make it sound.  And then puked in the bathroom.  You make it sound too much like you got a buzz off of it. 
[02:46:30]  All the kids.  All the kids are going to be rubbing baby shit under their nose.  By the way, Blotto from Blotto 98, Detroit.  Patrice equals bluffing puss wad.  Opie equals man of his word.  What a difference a week makes.  Yeah, because Patrice was supposed to take a fucking strap-on up the butt last week.  Well, you know, I'm not saying baby shit under your nose is a treat by any stretch of the imagination.  But Patrice getting fucked in the ass with a dildo and him backing out of that might...  I could see a little justification, man. 
[02:47:00]  See, you've got to just trick Patrice and tell him it's a cattle prod.  Dude, what do I wipe under my nose?  I really don't know what gets the smell of baby shit out of a man's mustache stubble.  You should ask a few pedophiles.  They could help you out.  Adult shit.  Cover it up.  Doesn't Bob Kelly owe him $100 for that diaper?  Yeah, Bob owes you $100.  Watch that.  He said if something comes in, $100 guaranteed.  Oh, that's right.  $100 cash, buddy. 
[02:47:30]  Fuck him.  Oh, fuck.  Dude, I need something for my nose.  I'm begging.  I'm begging.  I'm begging.  I would think probably lemon.  What do we got?  I'm serious.  See?  You should have kept some ketchup.  Sam in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Radio gold.  Yeah.  Yeah, that.  I really didn't think you were going to do it.  I would say radio green.  Dude, I actually, when I looked at the diaper the first time, and then what really got me 
[02:48:00]  was when I put the gloves on, and then I like smear like you would baby, I can't even  talk, like finger paint, and it was now a nice glob on each index finger, I started  getting lightheaded.  I started to go to a safe place.  Yeah, maybe, do we have a cleaning product?  Maybe like a dab, a little Lysol.  No joke.  I gotta go do something.  Yeah.  Do whatever you gotta do.  Put that in a paper towel and dab it in your whiskers.  Back to the Laszlo and Anthony show.  Yeah, let me, Laszlo, I've had something to confess. 
[02:48:30]  For quite a while.  Now, we'll take a break while Opie fucking tries to get baby shit out from under his  nose.  I can't believe you did that.  Give some breadcrumbs back to your dignity.  We'll be right back.  On the way, the hosts, staff, and the guests of the Opie and Anthony show dish out and  take even more verbal abuse as the worst of Opie and Anthony's spitting wheel of hate  continues.  Welcome back.  The vicious verbal beatdown keeps a-coming. 
[02:49:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony presents the spitting wheel of hate.  All right.  Welcome back to the spitting wheel of hate.  I'm your host, Roland.  Time to spin the wheel again.  Let's see who our next victim is.  Anthony.  It's Anthony.  Anthony, during the interview with the guy who runs FARC, we looked over and noticed  Anthony wasn't paying attention.  Find out what happens on the spitting wheel of hate. 
[02:49:30]  The spitting wheel of hate.  Another good example.  Out in Colorado, there was a homeowner's association that told a guy that he couldn't have a peace  sign in his Christmas decorations because it was a satanic symbol.  Now, that doesn't matter.  Who cares?  It's a homeowner's association, whatever.  That's a stupid thing to say.  But at the end of the day, this is nobody's business.  Front page CNN for 24 hours.  Wow.  Who cares?  That kind of stuff.  Yeah.  Why is it like that with people?  Like, I was away for two months out of the country.  I come back. 
[02:50:00]  It seems more like that kind of shit.  Like, people interested in dull shit.  Yeah.  Well, it's been going on for a while.  The Daily Coast did a great thing that I love to talk about.  In October of 2006, they took CNN's front page, stripped off all the crap news, all  the ads, all of what they call YouTube voyeurism.  In fact, I just saw it come across while we were sitting here talking about the news.  They had the two-headed turtle.  That's what they call YouTube voyeurism.  It's basically just crap that's on YouTube.  And they read it as bumpers.  Like, look at the otters holding hands.  You could probably see that on a newscast.  Right.  And they took all that crap off of CNN's main page, and they were left with five lines 
[02:50:30]  of text.  That was it.  And what they did was, is then they compared it to China News Daily, and you can't tell  the difference between those two pages, because they're running all news.  So people wrote in a complaint that said, well, it's unfair to compare it to China News  Daily.  So they went back, and they got a copy of CNN's homepage out of 2,000 out of the Internet  Archive and did the same thing, and you can't tell the difference.  It's definitely slipped.  It's gone from being total real news to just complete garbage and crap.  Well, even when you watch CNN, it's like, even when they're doing real news,  there's, like, Wolf Blitzer has to have a fucking music bed under him. 
[02:51:00]  It's like, why do you need a music bed?  Pounding bass.  Yeah.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  What is that?  Yeah, I have no idea.  It doesn't make any sense.  It's distracting.  It's not helping the story.  It's not informative.  It's just douchey and irritating.  Well, and that show he's got, too, where they've got, like, the dozen TV screens with  crap going on all of them.  What the hell is going on in the background there, exactly?  I know.  Are there channels?  Are we watching Fox?  Yeah.  On CNN, we're watching Fox on CNN.  That's where it's gotten to.  That'd be great if it was all animal fucking pornography. 
[02:51:30]  That's right.  That's where it's going.  If somebody in the back just kind of switched it and...  Yeah.  Well, that was the funny thing is, like, you know, we were talking about, you know, people  having sex with dogs being a traffic ratings crab.  There's a website called NC Buy in 2003 that made the mistake of, you know how every year,  like, around New Year's, they do the top ten stories of the year?  Well, and usually they'll pick, you know, the biggest stories of the year, and it's  usually it's editorially controlled.  Well, this North Carolina newspaper made the mistake, and I've never seen anybody do  this again, of doing it based on traffic to articles.  Number one article for 2003 was a guy who beat his son to death because he caught him 
[02:52:00]  in a barn fucking the family dog.  Wow.  Number one story.  It was fantastic.  That's a big one.  How old was the kid?  Like 12, 13.  I don't know.  What kind of dog was it?  I have no idea.  Golden Retriever or something.  I don't know.  Hey, Drew.  I think you're boring, Anthony.  Yeah, you fell asleep over there.  Look at that.  It's great.  I have a question for Drew.  What's up?  What's the peace symbol that resembles the Satan symbol?  It was just basically somebody trying to make a big fuss out of it, and so somebody claimed  that the peace symbol is a Satanic symbol. 
[02:52:30]  I have no idea.  But which peace symbol is that?  I'm really confused.  There's only one.  It's that one.  Isn't it this?  No, no, no.  The circle with the lines through it.  Okay.  You're familiar with this?  You know it.  You've seen it many times.  It looks like the Mercedes symbol.  Yeah.  That's it.  I thought the Satanic symbol was the one with the star in the middle of the circle.  Yeah, the pentagram.  Okay.  I was just trying to, like, catch everything. 
[02:53:00]  It was just a lot of stuff.  Oh, Francine, don't be fresh.  We lost Anthony, and everyone's just having a casual conversation.  I feel nauseous, too.  I feel like I'm going to puke since we sat.  When I eat too much fruit mixed with coffee, it does something in my stomach.  Anthony's out cold, and we're continuing to radio.  We should all jerk off on him.  We should just leave him, and he'll wake up.  Just keep the channel live with him sleeping. 
[02:53:30]  There you go.  Lower the shade.  I blame you, Drew.  You put him to sleep.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Bill O'Reilly found out that the two otters were gay on YouTube, and he says he's not against  otters, just otters having gay sex.  So he's not against gay otters.  That's what a general said.  A senator said, the general said, I'm against homosexuality. 
[02:54:00]  And the senator back here said, I agree with what he said.  And then the press came down on him and said, just how you really feel, that you're against  homosexuality.  He goes, I never said I was against homosexuality.  Homosexuality's fine.  I'm just against homosexual sex.  You know?  So what are they supposed to do?  Go to Starbucks and just wave at each other?  Wave different CDs at each other?  Go to Target and talk about cheats?  Exactly.  All those turgid cocks? 
[02:54:30]  No one can do anything with them?  I know, I know.  I didn't turgid.  Turgid, I gotta look that up.  Turgid, I think, means like stiff.  Yeah, Francine, you did a great job for us today.  Oh, thank you.  You're always good, Francine.  Hey, Rick, what are you plugging today?  Uh, Saturday night, I'm doing an hour's show at the cutting room at midnight, which is really  good.  It's been going good.  And I'm doing a Gino Bisconti's show at Caroline's after that Friday night at, uh, around one. 
[02:55:00]  It starts at 12 to the 30.  I'll be there after the cutting room.  Uh, and, uh, I was supposed to tell you I'm in a, I was in a car accident and I hallucinated  being chased by pine nuts, which is true.  Wait, what?  My friend said, I had a concussion and I walked around and I would slam the door and say,  shut the door, I'm being chased by pine nuts. 
[02:55:30]  Like, I had a concussion, I was hallucinating, I was talking to my phone, putting people  on hold, and I was making out with girls that weren't there, I was just like, like that.  This is what my friends told me.  So I just thought that'd be interesting.  But why pine nuts?  They're such a yummy treat.  I don't even think about pine nuts.  Why not walnuts or food I don't like?  Pine nuts are delish.  I never even think about pine nuts, that's why.  They're great in a salad, though.  You're fucking, what's better than pine nuts in a salad?  Candy corns!  I stand correct.  Rick and I are doing our own show, it's called Little, it's called, I fucked up. 
[02:56:00]  I was trying to think of what you'd call little things that go in salad, and I realized I had  nothing.  Salad treats!  I'm just amazed he's out cold.  Yeah.  I thought he was faking, but no.  Nah, no.  No.  He's not.  Narcolepsy strikes.  Hold on.  I'm so mad I let that salad improv go.  I didn't catch it, I didn't catch it.  It was my fault.  No, no, I didn't have anything, I flubbed it. 
[02:56:30]  I just saw this thing of us riffing on salad for a good 40 minutes.  Yeah.  Chickpeas, that's what we need.  There you go.  Chickpeas.  And sliced beets.  That's like the old time salad bar.  I like how you're looking at me right now, like, who cares?  No, I'm just, no, I'm pleased.  I fucking, I had a lobster salad last night.  I would suck a dick for one right now, it was so fucking good.  Where'd you have it?  The Aqua Grill down in the village.  Oh, yeah.  My broad and I, she went away today. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  Do you miss it terribly?  I do.  I was pecking her in the car like a fucking sissy.  You know what you'll do?  Put a little vanilla extract behind your ears.  You'll attract a man with a country home.  She fucking wrote me a text before she flew today.  And I always say to her before I leave, like, hey, you know, just in case I'm killed in the plane crash, I'll talk to you later.  And she's like, that's not, don't say that.  So she fucking wrote, plane is so small, if I die, I love you.  And I died feeling a little sad, you didn't text me back. 
[02:57:30]  I don't want you to carry the weight and feel guilty.  Just learn from it and go on to be a better man.  Good.  That's impressive, man.  It's encouraging.  And I know if she died in a plane crash, I wouldn't go on to be a better man.  I would just get a whore and forget.  Just pay for a blowjob.  Hey, a man, not a saint.  Remember that.  I deserve more.  That was very funny.  Yeah.  Let me see.  So Rick is going to be where? 
[02:58:00]  Hold on, let me see.  At the cutting room Saturday night.  Yeah.  Is that Saturday?  Yeah, yeah.  One hour show.  So, cutting room 12 midnight, but it's good because I throw in like Paul Anka music to  bits, like Hitler listening to Tom Jones and changing his mind about the Holocaust.  And the cutting room thing is going to be every week, Wednesdays and Saturdays.  But this week's important because I get to advertise it here.  My head's killing me.  Rick's a great live show. 
[02:58:30]  If you haven't seen Rick live, he's just, he's really, really smart and funny and interesting.  Then conceptually, it's interesting.  It's just a great fucking show, man.  For real.  Oh, thanks, man.  I love what you do.  We love each other.  Yeah, but I'll never admit it.  And Drew is, uh.  I just keep calling you and hanging up, saying he'll know it's me.  Is there, turn that mic on it. 
[02:59:00]  Keep talking.  Oh, because I'm, and I'm plugging, um, the gigs I'm plugging is the 12th and 13th, which  is next weekend when my HBO special airs.  Um, I'll be at the Redding Comedy Outlet.  Uh, it's in the Sheraton in, uh, Why I'm Missing, Pennsylvania.  And then the, I believe the following weekend, which is the, uh, 18th and 19th, or the 19th, 
[02:59:30]  20th, or whatever the fuck it is.  I'll be appearing, uh, in Danbury, Connecticut at the Treehouse.  I'm doing small rooms to promote, uh, and to work on my, uh, my new hour.  So, uh, I wanted to do small, intimate rooms and not big clubs, so, like, 150 seats or less  is pretty much gonna be the rooms I'm doing.  And, of course, Drew's book, uh, about FARC.  Um, it's not news, it's FARC, how mass media tries to pass off crap as news.  And, you know, FARC is a great website, and they've been a great friend to us. 
[03:00:00]  So, um, you know.  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  We're, uh, all leaving the studio.  So, we're gonna put on some easy listening music, and, uh, sometime between now and when 
[03:00:30]  Ron and Fess are on at noon, Anthony will wake up from his nap.  Have a good day.  Uh, we're still looking for the music.  And some.  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, I was just playing any.  I didn't want to stand in the voice.  Can you hear me?  Um, let's play any, let's play any Mozart.  Play something light.  Anything.  Play it low.  Is that my God?  Mm-hmm.  Put a cue, cue, cue me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Play it low, nice and light. 
[03:01:30]  Low.  Low.  Low.  Low.  Low.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Thank you.

[03:16:30]  I don't know. 
[03:17:00]  I should have known.  Sam.  Yeah.  To the hyenas.  Yeah, I thought they were.  I saw.  Hi, how are you doing?  Yeah.  I knew it from the music. 
[03:17:30]  Why else?  You were out cold.  I'm sleepy.  Leave me alone.  I was asleep for quite some time. 
[03:18:00]  Thank you. 
[03:18:30]  Great.  You're shitting me, right?  Line of the day.  I should have went to sleep when Danny left.  I was up too late.

[03:20:00]  I knew I was, I knew I was going to sleep, so my eyes were done.  Yeah, yeah, that classical music.  I'm sure that didn't help much.  Does this count as bonus time? 
[03:20:30]  Enjoy the replay, Ant.  Glad you're not a pilot.  Sleeping high ratings in the Maxwell Show.  Good morning.  You did.  Is that when you did that?  Oh, nappy.  Good morning.  They did leave Anthony alone. 
[03:21:00]  Wake up, douche.  Oh, my God.  That's good.  You're kidding.  I should have been out by fucking over at CBS.  Oh. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  When?  All right.  Bye.  See you tomorrow.  On Saturday.  Oh, fuck.  See you on Monday.  It's Saturday.  Maybe I should come in for a makeup day. 
[03:22:00]  The tree's canceled.  Nighty-night, rabbit.  The Wheel of Hate.  Find out who gets annihilated next as the worst of Opie and Anthony's spinning wheel of hate continues.  Welcome back to the worst of Opie and Anthony presents the spinning wheel of hate.  And now, here's your host, Roland. 
[03:22:30]  Welcome back to the spinning wheel of hate.  I'm your host, Roland.  Time to spin the wheel again and see who our next victim is.  Jim Norton.  You know what you mean, Norton.  Jimmy is almost impossible to get, but this one is a biggie.  When exit management sent down the legal notice that Jimmy would have to attend a sensitive training, find out how Jimmy reacts.  You know, on the spinning wheel of hate.  Oh, sensitivity training.  Ah. 
[03:23:00]  Me don't know how to read.  Me stupid.  The spinning wheel of hate.  We're going to Washington, D.C.  It is absolutely a joke.  I won't allow you to attend something like that.  I wouldn't.  All right.  Well, that's no joke, a three-hour meeting he has to do?  Not happening.  Wow.  No.  Not happening.  You don't want to do that.  Try to get some synergy going between us and Washington, D.C.  You don't want to do that.  And has just handed in the Opie and Anthony visit agenda.  Here's the best. 
[03:23:30]  So then we have the working lunch, and that will wrap at 1230.  So from 1230 to 130, it's kind of a wrap-up where you're saying goodbye to people and getting yourself out of there and you check out of the hotel.  And guess what?  At 130, Opie, Anthony, Eric, and Martini Steve all get to go to the train station at 130.  Back on the choo-choo.  So everyone leaves except, and it says it right here, Jim Norton.  And then Jim Norton from 130 to 430, three hours, will be hanging in human resources for sensitivity training. 
[03:24:00]  Do you understand you would have had a better shot if you would have written Jim Norton will model his abs and get a job with Ford Modeling.  You would have had a better shot at that.  If you think I'm staying down there and going through sensitivity training, you are out of your fucking mind.  It's not happening.  Sensitivity training, maybe you could send someone from human resources in, and they can tickle my bag a little. 
[03:24:30]  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area, and then they can leave.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That's going to be fun.  I smell promo.  Corporate diva.  This just is not happening.  Under any circumstances, well, that's not happening.  They're making you all take the train?  Yeah, we're taking the train.  Three hours, four hours?  No, that's actually fine.  Train's fine.  We don't mind a train.  We don't mind that. 
[03:25:00]  How about we have the sensitivity meeting on the train?  Did you take a 40-minute flight?  Three hours.  Don't you understand?  You have a better chance of Michael Corleone just handing the children over to Kay.  That is more likely than me staying for that horrendous three-hour meeting.  And the meeting should go like this.  1.30, human resources, attempts to talk about sensitivity training.  1.30, 5, they are wiping saliva that Jim Norton has spit on them off of themselves as he walks outdoor. 
[03:25:30]  That's how that meeting goes.  Hand out hankies on the way in.  Jim, we don't like a lot.  Ha-ha!  End of meeting.  If I ever beat a black man to death in New Orleans and sit on his face until he suffocates, I am more than deserving of some sensitivity training.  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts.  That is not happening.  This is not happening.  Not just your Tuesday three-hour meeting. 
[03:26:00]  Guys, they want us to do this once a month, by the way.  This isn't happening.  Well, you know something?  They've completely turned me off to going down there and doing anything.  Well, it was supposed to be...  XM people, don't you know that's why they agreed to do yours network?  So they didn't have to do this dumb shit.  I will circle this.  There it is.  Working lunch?  No.  I'm scratching out working.  There you go.  Lunch.  Lunch.  Lunch.  I'll keep lunch.  Lunch good.  But that's it.  Keep lunch.  Break. 
[03:26:30]  I'm keeping break, and I'm changing the 12 to a 1.  There you go.  12.30 to 1.45.  Investor conference?  What about system training?  Oh, where is that?  We don't have to push any buttons.  Oh, I don't care about that because I'm not involved.  Nope.  Steve and Eric, can you guys fight your own battle on that one?  Break.  Another break from 3.30 to 3.45.  But I see it's the Human Resources Legal 2005 policy goes to 4.15.  So now the break goes from 3.30 to 4.15.  There you go.  That's a nice long break. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, we're doing satellite radio.  Anything goes.  No one is missing from this whole schedule, by the way, marketing of the show.  Ah, yes.  The one thing we care about.  No wonder nothing gets done down there.  Because this is probably an example of what all these guys have to do.  All right.  Well, I got my schedule, and I'm happy with it now.  I just, I'm going to photocopy Anthony's and say that that is my schedule as well.  There it is.  This is amazing, actually.  I think he actually left the Human Resource Meeting.  Oh.  No, he knows better.  That thing.  No.  Yeah.  Nice.  There it is.  There you go.  Now it's a Jim Norton schedule. 
[03:27:30]  1.30 to 4.30.  Instead of HR sensitivity training, put laughing on train with friends.  As we zip north through Philadelphia.  As they sit there looking at their watches, wondering when you're going to arrive.  Exactly.  For the meeting.  Maybe the next time I go down, you can have promptness meetings, because I missed this  for a month.  Take staggering trip to bar car.  Let's go to Catherine.  Catherine.  To get you out of your meetings, boys. 
[03:28:00]  Yes.  All you need is to get Jim over there to kick a little shit rock out of his pants.  Bring in a little bucket of sawdust.  Sweat a chair and act like complete animals.  Good callback.  We should wet ourselves and crap our pants in the meeting.  Let me tell you this, and you can take this to the bank, as they say.  If there are meetings we're sitting through, all morning I'm drinking coffee with half  and half and other lactose-filled products.  I might have a banana smoothie.  I will show you the error of your ways.  If they want synergy, we'll give them synergy. 
[03:28:30]  You get to share in his lovely gas, too.  You have no idea what I will be doing in those meetings.  It's going to smell like an offshore oil drill rig.  Complete and total waste of time.  I will not, mark my words, I will not be party to this.  I will not be.  I will go to any meeting after the show that involves Eric Logan and some very high-end  marketing people to discuss the program, where we want it to go, and the marketing of the  program, I will not be in the XM building any later than 1.30, maybe? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, after lunch.  I'm done.  I'm done.  So sneak out.  Whatever you want to do for those three hours is great.  All they do in Entertainment Human Resources is they remove the humor from everything.  Oh, they do.  And look, let's be honest, for as much as we are pigs on the air, no one here has any  type of sexual harassment issues.  We don't have any, I mean, we've teased people on the air.  We don't interact in the office rudely with other people.  Under no circumstances am I having one of those awful meetings. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, as soon as we leave this little environment that is the ONA show, the studio here, that's  it.  We're not animals.  We know how to act in society.  What do you think, we run out there, grab the wiffle ball bat, and chase women around  outside the studio?  Here's the human resources meeting, how to better interact with coworkers.  It should be with us, human resources, and a moving company with a truck.  We could say how to get that furniture into the truck faster.  Get everyone else out of here.  Look, I went home yesterday and slept for five hours. 
[03:30:00]  I slept for five hours.  I went out and I did four shows.  I tried to sleep, but I overslept.  There's no way I'm doing that.  You know what?  It's not about that.  I would spend, honestly, six hours in Washington if I knew, in meetings, if I knew it was going  to make the show better.  I will sit for six hours and take any suggestion that's going to make this radio show better.  But this other stuff is just a waste of time that has nothing to do with Anthony and I  and Norton and everybody else putting on a clever, entertaining, funny show. 
[03:30:30]  But this other stuff is a complete waste of time.  Hey, Mike from Boston, you ass.  He writes, you dumb asses.  In corporate America, everyone has to go take stupid sexual harassment training.  Quit your bitching.  This was never supposed to be a corporate job.  Don't you get it?  Shut up.  You know what radio was all about before these stupid lawyers and suits and corporate people  got involved?  It was a bunch of guys that were losers and hippies that just got high and did drugs, came  into a radio station and played their favorite music. 
[03:31:00]  That's what this was supposed to be.  And now it's like, now they invented a human resource department, a human resource for  people like us that do radio?  Are you insane?  And as far as sexual harassment, you know, I don't need some corporate idiot telling me  about it.  I was raised properly and I'm a pervert when I spend my money.  I don't walk up to girls in the office and grab my crotch because I was raised right.  I know not to act that way.  Isn't it insulting that they think you have to go to a meeting to learn how to be a human  being that you're not going to go around with your schlong hanging out and walk into 
[03:31:30]  a cubicle and slap girls in the face with it?  And if you do, maybe you send them to training to not have those big tits showing during the  work day.  Yeah, those dirty bitches.  What did we learn on the show today?  Well, I can't.  I'm not even officially part of the show, but I just feel outraged for you.  And not just.  Yeah, but we bring this stuff up all the time and, you know, they're like, oh, you guys  complain too much on your radio show.  Well, yeah, we want to be the best radio show in America.  Simple.  That's our goal.  That's our goal.  But we need help to get there. 
[03:32:00]  We can't, you know, do this pretty good radio show to a small amount of people and assume  that it's just going to grow like a wildfire, you know?  We need help.  Real help.  We need to be off this stupid premium channel.  We've proven ourselves by now that we're not animals with fucking horns coming out of  our skulls.  That we put on a nice, clever, not nice, but a clever, entertaining radio show.  And it's a funny show.  And it's pertinent.  Do we get edgy and outrageous at times?  Well, yeah.  It's pertinent and it's new. 
[03:32:30]  I mean, it's relevant.  The show is like, this should be on like a regular channel.  Like, have your own channel.  But enough with the hiding.  The show is pretty much hidden.  Yeah.  And with that, we've done very, very well.  They're extremely happy with the amount of people listening to the show.  But we're not.  Because we know it could be a lot, lot better.  We're going to need you to go ahead and come in for the entire day on Monday.  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  And then why don't you go ahead and come in Tuesday also.  Yeah.  Where's your flare?  Did you get the memo on the cover sheet for the TPS reports?  Yeah.  That's exactly what it's like.  Office space.  The spitting wheel of hate.  So what are we going to say to Elo about these meetings and the agenda?  That we're not going.  Yeah.  Why even acknowledge it?  Just don't do it.  We say that we're not going.  But they have a whole schedule.  People are going to be sitting in conference rooms waiting for us to show up.  Let them sit. 
[03:33:30]  Let them sit.  Yep.  Unless we all want to draw straws and the one that loses has to go and represent the entire show.  But it ain't going to be me.  I'll tell you one thing.  In-room movies, room service.  That's who I'm meeting with.  I'm meeting with the wonderful person at the door with the cart.  Then why are we going there?  We have to go down there.  Room service.  We have to go down there and kind of like, you know.  I'll have a meeting right after the show.  Get some synergy with some of these people.  And we have to get some FaceTime with some of these people.  I won't have synergy or FaceTime.  Yeah.  I'm having a meeting after the show with a couple of people that are very involved with the future of this program. 
[03:34:00]  Anyone else?  Bye.  See ya.  Well, Army wants in on this really fast.  Army the trucker.  Go ahead, Army.  Yeah.  Consensitivity for others.  Consideration for others.  Training.  Give me a break.  Oh.  What kind of garbage is this?  I'll tell you what.  This stuff is weakening our country.  It's making us a country of pussies.  I don't think so, man.  It's more thought policing by the left.  Yep.  That's all.  It's more thought. 
[03:34:30]  And again, if you're sexually harassing somebody at work, you should be fired.  But don't try to cut me off at the past.  I was raised, right?  Well, it's corporate BS that they want us to go through.  Because these corporate scumbags have been protecting people who make money for the company,  who sexually harass their secretaries, so they protect the guys that make the money.  All right, man.  They protect these guys, and then they make the rest of the people in the corporation suffer  because they got sued because they overprotected.  They should have fired.  Well, dude, I don't want to deal with the whole ELO thing.  Someone else has got to deal with the phone call saying that-  I'll deal with it. 
[03:35:00]  Not going.  Click.  That this agenda is way out of hand.  Yeah.  Well, I don't really care about the sensitivity of training because I don't see Anthony and  my name next to that part of this agenda.  No, I just see us on Monday with 19 hours of meetings all the way to 9.30 at night.  That ain't happening.  We'll cut a few of these things out, but we will get some FaceTime with some of the people  down there and talk about how to make this show better.  I'm drooling on my pillow by 9.30. 
[03:35:30]  I will not be sitting in a meeting or having dinner or talking to institutional investors  or automotive people.  Context of show in automobile.  Let's say hi to ELO.  It's ELO.  Eric?  How are you?  Hi, Eric.  How you doing, Eric?  Mr. Logan, how are you?  Jimmy?  Pleasure to speak with you.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  I'm tired, actually.  I'm very cranky.  Listen, I wanted to just let you know that I really appreciate all the help you're giving 
[03:36:00]  us.  We actually are applying for our Canadian license as we speak with the Canadian government.  Are you really?  Yes.  Ah, please.  Good.  You'll get it.  No, I think the last 15 minutes will go a long way in communicating our support for  the Canadians and how we can be in business with them.  Hence the sensitivity training.  I apologize.  I wasn't being very sensitive.  Yeah, I mean, that's the 1.30 on Tuesday, so.  1.30 on Tuesday, meeting with Canadians.  Yes.  Yeah, actually.  Coming with a make-believe jersey on. 
[03:36:30]  If you don't mind, I'm going to distract the HR sensitivity training.  I'm just going to put Canadian sensitivity training.  I have to apologize to the prime minister, but I have to do it through a hole in a buddy  booth.  That stupid country stinks.  So, Eric, obviously, Norton has a little problem meeting with human resources and talking  about sexual harassment and sensitivity training.  I don't know.  I mean, it's just really, honestly, just company policy.  I mean, everybody has to go through it.  I mean, you don't have to be involved.  You can just sit there and watch the videos, and there's a little test at the end of it 
[03:37:00]  that you have to fill out.  A test?  You saw it, and you have to kind of, it's kind of a quiz, and they have some questions  on there that says things to the effect of, you know, it's like, you know, if somebody  approached you in the hallway and said this.  Scenarios.  I can't tell you what the questions are, obviously, but, I mean, it's, you know, you  get the point.  You have to kind of test out of the class because for people who don't, they have to go back  through it again because it's something that, you know, corporate America makes us do.  Well, here's how you know I'm doing the test.  After the video of the sexual harassment, you guys can turn the lights on, and when 
[03:37:30]  you see a powerful tent in the front of my pants, you'll know I passed.  Well, okay, and the answer to every question is throw her against the wall and take what's  yours.  But I'm sure we can work that out.  So, can we cut down?  By the way, guys, I apologize on the agenda, too.  5.30, I had to check in.  You guys are getting here on a Sunday, so that was a typo on my behalf.  I apologize.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I was wondering about that.  And also, how come, and I'm not trying to throw my friends in the barrel, but none 
[03:38:00]  of the other guys had to go through sensitivity training?  Well, we sort of.  They did.  They came down.  I don't know where you were.  I think you were on the road or something before the show started.  I know we talked to human resources for a little while.  I sat in hours of meetings when we were down there.  I don't even know what they were for.  Are you telling me I actually sat through that?  I was passed out completely in the meeting.  I was, I was, was that the one in the big conference room?  That was the one in the big conference room, yes.  Well, there's no way I'm sitting in a three-hour meeting with a woman from the human room.  I can't have, who am I going to sexually harass?  It's all guys up here.  Well, Jimmy, I mean, look, I mean, it's greater for three hours. 
[03:38:30]  I mean, you just need to calm down.  That's what you need to do.  I'm very calm.  No, you're not.  You're out of your mind.  Am I going to look at the mule of the guy who runs the Broadway channel in the restroom?  What am I going to do?  Jimmy, it's only three hours at the most.  I mean, again, you know, I will, I will cut some of the stuff out.  I mean, try to get you out of here by four and you can catch the 410 and you can be back  in New York by seven, seven 30.  Can't happen.  Well, what can happen though is she can come here.  She's more than welcome to come here and follow me around while I do my spots and wait in the  car for me. 
[03:39:00]  And then I can talk to her as I'm driving from the cellar to stand up in New York.  All right.  Well, you know what, Jimmy, we should talk offline.  Cause I mean, you and I really have to hammer this out.  I mean, this is just, I mean, it's something that has to happen.  I mean, everybody goes through this.  Not happening.  It's gotta happen.  Can't happen.  Why not?  Because I, I don't subscribe to it.  I think it's more thought policing.  Um, and I think that the guilty should be fired immediately and I'm guilty of nothing.  And, uh, I, I don't sexually harass people.  I'm a pig on the air and I'm a pig off the air, but not in the office.  I ignore everybody in the office. 
[03:39:30]  What's, what's, what's the whole sensitivity training as far as Norton goes?  Well, I mean, really what it is, is just to kind of understand where personal boundaries  are and what's considered over the line.  And it's not as much about content on the show.  It's just behavior in the corporate workplace.  And, and since, you know, we want to get you guys more integrated down here, as you know,  Jimmy, and bring it down.  We just need to make sure we're really clear about where the lines are.  I mean, we've had, you know, we've had people go through this and we're, you know, launching  the baseball channel.  We're putting our, you know, we're putting our baseball athletes, you know, Kevin Kennedy's 
[03:40:00]  going through this and we're all, we all got to do it.  Are they going to sit down for sensitivity training so people know that they shouldn't  shoot steroids and then be a hero to children?  Maybe they could sit in the meeting with him.  Me and Giambi could sit there and chit chat for a little while.  And I'll tell you where the line is.  It's right under my belt and it's in the form of a zipper and I'll take it out and show  any gal who wants to see it.  I mean, you're making my point, Jim.  I mean, I understand your, I understand your angst about this, but.  It's not even angst.  I'm a gentleman off the air. 
[03:40:30]  I treat people respectfully and I will not be put through any type of silly corporate  training when I've done nothing to merit it except be a fine fellow.  I just want to be able to tape this meeting and throw it on the air.  There's no way I'm leaving after everybody else.  It's an impossibility.  I don't know.  I mean, we can tape it, Opie.  I mean, it's a great idea.  I mean, it'd probably be a good thing for everybody to kind of understand.  I mean, it's not as bad as you think it is.  It really is not.  It's horrendous on every level.  I'm giving up two nights of stand-up to be down there to begin with, which I can't afford to  because I'm trying to make a tape for The Tonight Show.  I'm not going to give up three more hours, get on a train later, and then come home by 
[03:41:00]  myself like an ass because I was talking to some lady who's got shorter hair than most  ladies should and human resources.  Well, you know, you guys can discuss this, but I have a problem with the number of meetings  that we're in.  Well, I mean, listen, I mean, and also just understand something.  I know I got a message from Ben about the Ram dinner that night, you know, with the 15 
[03:41:30]  people, everybody who's coming.  Even though it says 30 people, it's broken out into markets.  So we will have, you know, that'll be done within two hours for sure.  You do understand you're saying the word hours.  Yeah.  No, I know.  You have 60 minutes.  So it's like 120, possibly 140, 145 minutes if you want to go by the minute.  I just thought we'd do hours.  Will you go to that, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Dinner.  Of course.  I'll eat.  And then maybe we could cover the sensitivity training.  Maybe I could just stand naked and Gloria Allred could come in and point at my genitals  and go dirty, dirty, dirty. 
[03:42:00]  Could happen.  Jimmy?  Yes, sir.  You know I love you, right?  And it's very mutual.  I mean, seriously.  You know I love you.  Yes.  And I'm very fond of you.  Okay.  And you know that there's no way in hell I'd make you sit through three hours of sensitivity training.  No, of course not.  Because I'll be on the train or I'll be in New York.  I'll be in New York.  Opie, you can tell us.  He so got you.  Ah!  Oh!  He so got you.  Oh!  I sat in my office yesterday. 
[03:42:30]  Ah!  And because Jimmy was like, what are we doing?  What are we doing?  So I figured, what the hell?  I'll make an agenda.  We so got him!  Oh, my God.  You re...  Do you know, and I'm going to be really honest with you.  I was...  At first, I'm like, this is a joke.  I was sure it was a joke.  I'm walking home yesterday, and I'm like, this is not a joke.  This is...  Because corporate America is so...  You...  I gotta...  God...  Damn it! 
[03:43:00]  Oh, you really nailed me.  Bravo, Elo.  When I put break and I put free time on there,  Yeah.  I said, I screwed up.  I said, they're gonna see right through.  We got the king, man.  We got the king.  But that was...  That was so well...  I really...  And the explanation...  What you were just saying on the thing...  I mean, I didn't want to yell at you, because A, I like you, but more importantly, you can  fire me.  You're my boss.  But I'm like, this son of a bitch is really gonna put me through this.  Wow.  You know, I'd love nothing more to get the tapes and just go through it with this. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  That would be...  I mean, actually, it would be a great...  Honestly, here's the deal.  When this came in yesterday, I was had.  I was definitely had all day yesterday.  I was had.  Anthony was had.  And then I started feeling guilty, because I know how Norton obsesses about things.  I'm like, this is a fun gag, and we'll get him bad.  We'll smash him really good.  But I know he'll spend all night.  That's probably why he didn't sleep, by the way, if I know you a little bit.  I was going to say that this morning.  I felt really bad.  No, I'm not even kidding.  Elo, I guarantee you're obsessed about this all day long. 
[03:44:00]  I thought about it yesterday.  I didn't think about it at night.  I was too depressed about my sexual addiction.  But you got me, and I deserved it, because I'm a creep.  But I'm like, this is about things I've said on the show.  They're worried.  I'm going to do something in the office.  You really nailed my stupid, fat face.  Good one.  Oh, that was a good one.  Bravo, Elo.  This was a good one.  I had to do something.  You really nailed it.  It's going to be fun.  You guys come down here.  I promise you there's no hours of meetings.  We're going to have a great time and do a couple things and get you guys out of here.  That was brilliantly.  The break things were, that was the only error, because the other stuff was so brilliantly worded. 
[03:44:30]  It was hysterical.  It was 15 minutes for free time.  And what was it?  The cat yesterday was like, because you were asking when you could take your dump, and the guy was like,  Hey, lighten up.  You got two 15 minutes for free time.  Were you guys just all sitting around in Washington, just laughing hysterically in an office somewhere  as we're losing our minds up here?  Actually, the funny part about the whole Ram dinner, I mean, there is no Ram dinner.  I mean, the dinner's going to be us jerking off at an Irish pub getting hammered.  I mean, that's what it's going to be.  Right, right.  Son of a bitch. 
[03:45:00]  But anyway, so Brian Shea and Dan Murphy and all the guys that run all the Circuit Cities and Best Buys and clients,  all the Rams, which are the regional area managers all across the country, all were listening to the show.  They all called him in a fit of rage and panic yesterday, going, what are we presenting?  We didn't even know we had to be there.  So they had no idea either.  Got those dim wits, too.  I think Anthony was suspicious the whole time.  No, I was suspicious at first.  Not even at first.  Not at first.  At first, I bought it.  Then as I looked at it more, I'm like, there's no way this could be real. 
[03:45:30]  And then, as I remembered some of the stuff that's gone on in the corporate world, I was like, oh, my God, this is true.  So, yeah, I was completely gotten.  Do you know what helped sell me?  And it was a little thing.  It was when I upset you text messaging him and said, oh, stop being babies.  It's one day of work.  And that was such â€“ yesterday you said he said that on the show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was such a boss thing to say.  Oh, no, that was â€“  It's just one day, guys.  Right, right.  That was a listener, actually.  I thought it was Eric Logan.  Oh, no, no, no.  For some reason, I misinterpreted that as Logan, and that sold me. 
[03:46:00]  No, because I didn't know until last night when I was getting ready to crash.  Yeah, Opie figured that and called that.  Well, no, I â€“  At 8.30, right?  My text message was, I hate your guts.  Payback's going to be a bitch.  I go, we're never gotten.  And then I'm like, well, we won't tell Jim because we'll have fun tomorrow with this.  That is really â€“  Hey, by the way, what is institutional â€“  Shareholder?  Yeah, shareholders.  But, you know, basically, Joe Utenauer, who's our CFO, you know, manages all the big funds 
[03:46:30]  like Legg Mason and T. Roy Price and all those folks that actually â€“ that have a large  amount of stock in the company.  So they often ask questions about where we're going and stuff.  So it's not unusual for us to do, you know, investor meetings and stuff like that.  Ah, there's the memo.  The schedule being ripped up.  Very good, Eric.  Yeah.  That was very good.  That was written up.  Those little things were written up so well.  That was â€“ because it's like â€“ we're not dumb.  And it's like, goddammit, this is for real.  Like, we thought it was a goof and then, like, no, this is real. 
[03:47:00]  It was worded the way they actually word things.  But, I mean, it's â€“ I mean, that would be â€“ honestly, I mean, the thing about it  is that that would not be an uncommon day at XM.  Right.  That's why it sold so well is because I looked at it going, no, this is what they deal with  on a daily basis.  Yeah.  I mean, it's meetings and meetings and meetings.  And, yeah, I mean, it's what it is.  And I think Opie said it with XM, you know, extreme meetings.  All right.  All right, Eric.  Good one, man.  You guys have a good day.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Bye, Eric.  I love that.  So happy with himself that he got us.  He really, really got me.  You should have saw your face when we were telling you. 
[03:47:30]  Nailed.  Priceless.  We should have freaking videotaped that.  Because he kind of was like â€“ and, like, I talk to him very comfortably.  He's a really good guy.  But in that moment, he's, like, kind of in boss mode.  When he said, we'll talk about this offline, it was like, oh, no, Jimmy's going to have  to sit through this meeting on the phone now about the meeting.  Offline.  It's like, uh-oh.  That was good.  You're really â€“ you're rarely gotten.  Yeah.  I got to respect that.  That was a good one.  On the way, the hosts, staff, and the guests of the O.P. Anthony Show dish out and take 
[03:48:00]  even more verbal abuse as the worst of O.P. Anthony's spinning wheel of hate continues.  Welcome back.  The vicious verbal beatdown keeps a-coming.  The worst of O.P. Anthony presents the spinning wheel of hate.  I'm Roland, producer Talbucker for the O.P. Anthony Show.  It's bonus time, everyone.  Where we spin the wheel for anyone is game. 
[03:48:30]  Let's see what comes up.  Ooh.  Danny.  Oh, shit.  It's Danny again, son.  This time, we need to eat Taco Bell or Chipotle.  This time, our buddy Laszlo is in the studio and talks about what a pain in the ass it was  to take Danny to a camping trip.  Does Danny end up in another man's sleeping bag?  Stay tuned.  The spinning wheel.  Are you doing anything Saturday, Lasz?  I am going to be out of town. 
[03:49:00]  Where?  I'm going to be up in Massachusetts.  Where, I might say, I took Danny, who I felt sorry for because he didn't get promoted  and a bunch of other stuff.  And he was having a terrible week.  He'd ruined your carpet because he's terrible at having a girlfriend.  And Keith had to throw him out and take his keys.  So I said, you know what?  Let me take you camping.  I'm getting some friends together. 
[03:49:30]  We're going to go into the woods up in Massachusetts where I've got a cabin up there.  And it'll be easy.  We'll be like 100 feet from the cabin.  So if the weather's shitty or whatever.  Right.  Sure.  And he asked Keith.  This is how much this group of people hate each other.  He asked Keith for a tent.  He literally got a tent from his parents from the Korean War.  I do.  The instructions were typed out.  I mean, you imagine somebody going, hey, girl, type this up so the boys in the field  know how to put it together.  It was this.  Dude, it was so fucking thick. 
[03:50:00]  It was.  Dude, there were poles on the inside that held it up.  Like a mash tent?  Dude, it was a proper 4077 fucking tent.  Meanwhile, you got those modern, lightweight, fits-in-your-pocket tents.  Exactly.  How long did you camp for?  Just a couple of days.  He was there 30 minutes, and my friend, who was in his 50s, pulled me aside and goes,  your friend's really out of shape.  Oh, shit!  Danny has been fucking-  Because they fucking timed it!  These fucking cocks do this shit all the fucking time. 
[03:50:30]  I've never been camping before.  Like, real camping, like where you do shit?  We were walking through the forest.  He's like, and then he's text messaging, this is really- I'm really tired.  I'm like, what are you doing?  We're out in nature.  He's like, I can't get a signal.  Oh, shit!  And then later, you know, we sort of relax in front of the campfire and have some drinks  and shoot the shit.  He's like, okay, I wanted to throw his fucking iPhone in the fire.  Because fucking Berlin wasn't checking his phone every two seconds.  No.  Dude, you are unbelievable.  And here's what happens-  Who was he trying to get on the phone? 
[03:51:00]  He's like, I gotta give T-Boy shit!  And I'm like, you're here with me.  See, and this is the thing, when you go over to Anthony's and his young apprentice, Danny,  who's always over there, you're not spending time with Danny or Anthony.  You're spending time with their iPhone.  That's true.  We will just sit there and text and text and text.  And then the only conversation we really have is, you want another beer?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  Glad I came over so I could watch you text bitches.  And they're texting each other.  That was the tent that I got to borrow. 
[03:51:30]  That is an old school tent.  Yeah, you could fit like five people in there.  Massive.  That doesn't look fun at all.  Meanwhile, he's busting my balls.  His friend had the same exact fucking one.  But he brought it as a joke.  He goes, I got this tent I have.  He goes, I had this tent since the 70s.  I want to see if it'll still work.  And by the way, it's not like we just went on this nice little trail or anything.  It was like climbing a mountain.  We went eight miles up until-  No, it was not like climbing a mountain.  How far are you off? 
[03:52:00]  On Friday-  There was some steeps.  It was like climbing a ladder.  On Friday, we went for a hike for literally one hour.  And it was very flat terrain.  30 minutes into it.  Dude, he's huffing and probably sweat pouring down his face.  We're in jeans!  We're in jeans!  It was unseasonably warm last time.  Oh, shit.  And then the next day, we went on the Appalachian Trail.  And I literally thought that we were going to have to carry him.  He was a fucking mess.  Well, look, when someone invites you to go camping, I thought, to me, camping is you sit by the fire, you drink beer. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, that's the other thing, the beer.  I told him, I said, everybody brings, you know, an assortment of cool beers and stuff.  We sort of, you know, share beers and all that.  He shows up with Bud Light.  Nobody drank any of his shitty beer.  Good, more from me.  Oh, but you were happy to try it.  Oh, that's a nice exotic beer from Boston.  I'll try that one.  And then on Sunday.  Bud Light cleanses the palate.  On Sunday, everybody leaves, right?  Because normally when you go camping, like, you wake up pretty early. 
[03:53:00]  Everybody leaves.  And it's just his lone tent in the woods.  And I'm sitting there, like, at 11 o'clock in the morning, noon, going, any time, Danny.  Danny likes to sleep in.  Wake up and go.  You should have just left a tent out there.  Oh, that's great.  How far were you from here?  Three hours.  Except in Western Mass.  And how far of a hike into the woods was it?  What?  Once you park your car, how long do you have to walk?  See, the cars are on the other side of that house. 
[03:53:30]  And they've got their tents in the backyard.  Right.  It's basically tents in the backyard.  We were 12.  And we wanted to sleep outside.  Why don't you sleep in the cabin?  Because it's fun sleeping on the ground where it's really uncomfortable.  Yeah, I would have hated to play Xbox and have heat.  That would suck.  I thought it was unseasonably warm.  And I was like, are you going to be?  And we're on the Appalachian Trail.  And we're about three hours in.  And he's in bad shape.  And I'm like, dude, what's going on?  He's like, I just go home and rip bong hits and eat Burger King. 
[03:54:00]  It's really hard doing morning radio.  Do nothing.  Do nothing with your body for like two years.  And then do an eight-mile hike on the Appalachian Trail.  Do it.  It was not.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was eight miles.  It was eight miles.  It was tough.  On the way, the hosts, staff, and the guests of the Opie and Anthony show dish out  and take even more verbal abuse as the worst of Opie and Anthony's Spitting Wheel of Hate continues. 
[03:54:30]  Welcome back.  The vicious verbal beatdown keeps a coming.  The worst of Opie and Anthony presents the Spitting Wheel of Hate.  Welcome back to Spitting Wheel of Hate.  I'm your host, Roland.  Time to Spitting Wheel again and see who our next victim is.  Master Poe.  Us.  F.H. Reilly's behind the dumpster. 
[03:55:00]  It's me, Master Poe.  Former show leech.  Yeah.  Free dinner, man.  Master Poe gets grilled in the following segments for having body.  Oh, man.  I remember when I farted.  Nothing smells worse than Master Poe.  Hooking up with the listeners and fucking behind F.H. Reilly's.  He does that a lot.  Master Poe gets in on this.  On the Spitting Wheel of Hate.  Us.  If you're in Florida, run.  He's there, I hear.  The Spitting Wheel of Hate. 
[03:55:30]  You know what I got to realize?  Danny's starting to get really cocky.  Oh, he is.  I really noticed.  He is really stepping forward and saying,  I ain't taking you guys' shit too much longer.  I got to realize one of the...  Ron and Fez have been calling me and I'm ready to jump ship,  so don't give me any bunk.  Well, I do have the biggest dumps around here.  He got a little rambunctious this morning, too.  We needed somebody.  See, it's raining here in New York.  It's been raining for a week straight.  And I do not like walking in the rain.  I don't have an umbrella. 
[03:56:00]  I don't want to get soggy and sit here wet and cold like a little puppy all day.  So, I pull up in front of the building and I phone my good friend, Steve C.  That's right.  And say, Steve, I will give you the opportunity to drive a real vehicle  and take my Escalade to the parking garage.  A real gas guzzler.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Uses like a year's worth of gas for his car just driving to the garage.  Exactly.  It's nice.  And Steve drives and parks the car. 
[03:56:30]  And how do you get back when that happens?  Sometimes I walk.  Sometimes Poe follows me and drives me back.  Oh, I would hope Poe would because it's raining.  No, he's been cool about it.  You have to.  He's been cool about it.  So, today, it's like, I don't know, the fourth day in a row or whatever it is.  It's the whole week.  The fifth day.  I didn't want to bug Steve because he's a busy guy in the mornings.  It's before the show.  He has better things to do than drive my frigging car around.  So, I decided to make a decision today that Poe will drive my truck around. 
[03:57:00]  It's a great honor to drive my vehicle to the parking garage.  I'll say.  It is something of trust.  I have confidence in the people that do this.  That is why Steve is one of the only people.  And now Poe has driven my vehicle around.  But now what was needed was Poe to drive it around and someone to drive Poe's car to follow my vehicle  so Poe can then drive back from the garage.  So, I came up and I was looking for an intern or something to drive Poe's car  because, quite frankly, I don't care who drives Poe's car. 
[03:57:30]  They could drive it into a pole for all I care.  So, you know, grab anybody.  No interns.  It was too early.  So, in the office, everybody's doing something.  I guess the least important thing that was being done at that time was being done by Danny.  And Danny just started.  So, you're saying Danny doesn't work hard for us?  He was going.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  That's what I heard.  At the time.  If we were doing bit triage in the morning, his patient could have sat there while the other patients were being worked on.  Good way to say it.  This particular morning. 
[03:58:00]  Right.  You might be right.  But, there are other mornings where his top priority, you know, sucking chest wound is the bit he's working on.  No, I'm not trying to get out of it.  No, I'm not.  You're trying to make something more of this than I am.  We all know we give Danny the easiest stuff in the morning to do.  So, why don't we just bring it to the table now?  Sits at the special ed computer at the end.  The one that doesn't have any real programs on it to do any real work.  Just keep hitting enter over and over.  Yeah, all you hear from that computer is, I'm contributing. 
[03:58:30]  Yes, you are.  I'm contributing to the show.  Because they made us hire a retard.  The reality is, it's fun to make.  He really, Danny really works hard for us.  Of course he does.  Sure does.  Photographing his own shit and all.  Yeah.  I'm producing.  You certainly are.  But he gave a little bit of an attitude this morning.  Like, he didn't want to drive post car. 
[03:59:00]  Like, it was like, yeah, all right.  Like, you could say he was sitting there.  He's got his headphones on.  He's hearing the conversation that's going on, that we need somebody to drive.  He's listening.  No one else is coming to the table.  And he's sitting there like, I know it's going to end up on me.  I know.  So then finally when it was like, Danny, you know, drive post car.  He's like, is there a problem with them?  Your duties here?  No, not with the duties.  Duties.  Obviously not from the picture I saw.  It's like a fucking plane spelling things. 
[03:59:30]  It looked like an air.  You should be taking shits over Jones Beach.  My dumps, you could easily find, you could find the same thing on Central Park South.  That's a huge error.  But the problem.  Thank you.  I'm getting away with that one.  Wow.  He tried to add to it and everything.  Cheers.  That's how huge they are.  But seriously.  And then he trods forward. 
[04:00:00]  He wasn't even trying to do comedy.  Yeah, no, seriously, they're big.  I'm not really trying.  Welcome to the bomb reel.  You got that one with anyone?  Central Park.  What did you do?  Central Park South?  Shut up, Jimmy.  I'm just trying to figure out who it was.  Oh, hey, you're going to take that, yo.  You're going to take that.  You got balls.  Sorry.  So, you know, was there a problem with doing that? 
[04:00:30]  No, no, the task is fine.  The task at hand is fine.  But there is a little slight.  Eric is back in the studio.  There's a slight odor problem in Poe's car.  With Poe's car?  What's the odor in your car?  Dead bodies?  Is there an odor in your car?  Have people told you your car stinks?  Steve?  Steve has never told me my car stinks.  Smells like dogs.  Well, yeah.  Oh, is that what it is?  Steve's a big pussy. 
[04:01:00]  Steve can't even get in my car.  It takes him about 15 minutes.  There he goes.  If you really want to see how pissed off I can get, why don't you plant one right fucking  here?  Oh.  And when your arm breaks, then.  Well, why does his car smell?  His car smells like dogs.  Yeah.  What dogs?  Plant what?  Yeah, plant what?  A fist or a kiss?  A smooch.  Because if I'm going to get an anvil, I'm not going to use my fist.  Yeah, exactly.  No, well, the big issue is I don't want to fucking club anybody.  I'm going to smash Jimmy in the face for making fun of me verbally. 
[04:01:30]  What?  No, I don't want to do that.  Let's hope not.  But why is this anger coming out, Steve?  No, it's not.  We're all smashing your children.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You just plant one.  How do I articulate this?  Because I'm not retaliating physically, I'm a pussy?  I'm afraid.  No one's calling you a pussy.  He just did, Steve.  He did.  He did.  He did.  He did.  That was the exact word that came out of his mouth.  He called me a pussy.  Hit him.  That's right.  And just because I'm not around here throwing people out windows means I'm a fucking pussy?  That's pretty much what Oprah's saying. 
[04:02:00]  I think I don't agree with that.  Holy jeez.  Poe was the one who called you out, and I was just acknowledging the fact that it sounded  kind of, you know.  No, Poe just said I didn't say anything, and then I...  Yeah, but you've been driving his car a lot.  Or how many times?  Every time I got to park Ant's car.  Then you park his?  No, no, no, no, no.  Then I get a ride back to the studio.  Yeah, he's following, and then you got to ride in it.  So, every morning, I follow Steve to park Anthony's car, and I bring him back to the studio. 
[04:02:30]  Whether it rains, it doesn't matter.  I want to make sure that he gets back to the studio on time.  Of course.  And he never complained.  Not once.  No?  Not once.  Well, it's hard.  Not once.  He laughed, because we have the show on.  We talk, you know, about, you know...  You don't want to, like, say...  You know, it's awkward.  It's embarrassing.  You don't want to sit there and go, wow, your car stinks.  Unless you bring it up, like, immediately.  You get in and go, whoa, this car stinks.  But after you've driven a while, it kind of builds up.  It's hard to confront somebody.  I don't think he smells it anymore. 
[04:03:00]  I think he's used to it.  Are you, Steve?  Are you, Steve?  What, the dog smell?  Yeah.  I have a dog, so I know what that smell is.  You really don't like it.  We don't really like it, though, do you?  No, it's not pleasant.  I know what dog smell is.  That's why I'm...  I got in the elevator, and the whole thing smelled like dog liquid.  No one on it.  It's like, when they're wet, it's awful.  Wet dog people with their stupid dogs.  Fuck, in the elevator, in their cars, in your apartments.  In your home.  You're stinking it up.  Your basement.  Can we bring this back around?  Yeah.  First of all, Steve, I'm sorry I called you a pussy.  It's okay. 
[04:03:30]  You look all set.  I don't like the fact that he yelled it up, though, and didn't tell Master Poe that he should  plant one.  Plant one.  Oh, if Master Poe hits me, it's going to be a rough fight, because Poe can probably do a number  on me, but I'll get some good hits in.  Wow.  Yeah, your head on the floor.  Holy shit.  Maybe.  Maybe.  We're one wrong word from a massive fight in the studio hall.  It really is.  You can feel the tension.  I am so tired of being called a pussy.  I might just fucking- 
[04:04:00]  Don't get all upset.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, it's like, listen, I don't mean to interrupt your faggot.  But I wound up-  Oh, Jesus.  Are you fucking kidding?  No, can I not talk?  I'm just-  I wound up being mad, man.  He no longer hates me.  That's all I care about.  I was cranky when I came in.  Now he's focused on you.  It's the weather.  I was sweating there for a while.  What?  Oh, he was mad?  Yeah, no.  He's a little hot.  He forgot all about me.  He gets a little hot under the slip.  Oh, oh.  But I wound up coming in in a very bad mood, and I think everybody has an odd mood today. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  Steve, I have a great fear of you, by the way.  I don't want people to be afraid.  I have no problem.  I don't want people to be afraid.  Then I'm not.  Okay, thank you.  Whatever you want, that's what I'm offering for you.  When you come in that day with a high-powered rifle and start walking around, I want to  be the guy that you pointed at.  I want to be the guy that's interviewed later.  That's it.  He pointed it right at me.  He thought about it.  And then smiled, nodded, and walked away and shot Opie right in the head.  I'm not going to shoot Opie.  Like, that's the guy I want to be. 
[04:05:00]  Hold on.  Would I be the first one you shoot?  No.  Why are you saying that?  No, I wouldn't shoot anybody.  If you had to, would I be the first one you shoot?  I wouldn't shoot you.  Oh, God.  In order?  No, if you had to.  You're coming in.  You're the disgruntled employee.  No, no.  You're coming in.  Who you shoot first because you have that much anger toward.  You'd be first.  Steve's going to give this order.  Who can fire me the least?  Who has the least firing power?  All the interns get shot first.  Okay.  That's actually accurate.  You have a room full of dead interns. 
[04:05:30]  Would you shoot me first?  No.  Why do you want to hurt Opie?  Who would you shoot?  Who's first?  Who's first?  See, this is where you get the label of the P word.  You have to at least answer this question now.  I'm thinking.  Who would you shoot?  What, Pam?  I'm looking around.  Who would you shoot first if you were the disgruntled employee?  I'd shoot Eric first.  Do I have to shoot people?  That's really the only option?  I'll be honest.  I'd shoot Eric first.  If I went completely crazy, came in with a gun, and just everyone was available to shoot,  because you'd probably just shoot the first person you see, you know, kind of make a statement.  But if I looked and everyone was available to shoot, I'd probably just shoot Eric. 
[04:06:00]  Nothing personal.  Just, you're very shootable.  And he's the easiest one to blame, because they go, why'd you do it?  You could just open your mouth, and some reason would fly out that was accurate.  But the CD had the wrong shit on it.  Well, it did happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve, if I had to go in order of disgruntled employee, and your objective is to wipe out  as many of your coworkers as possible.  You don't have to give it that much thought.  Just, you come in, you're angry.  Yeah, because who's the one you shoot for? 
[04:06:30]  Well, the first person I'm going to see if I walk in with a gun is this guy, is Poe.  It's got to be Poe.  So Poe goes down first.  You have to take him out first.  You've got to take out Poe first.  So you can take out the rest of the office.  So you can take out everybody else.  But it's like, no, it's like a video game.  He's the boss, and he's in that room with the Kevlar and the bulletproof glass, and you  can't access him until you wipe out a few other people and can get to the switch.  Then you're going after stormtroopers, basically.  So you have to go out and you have to go through a round of them.  Picture Steve there with a fucking rifle and Poe just going, hold on, and then swiping  in there. 
[04:07:00]  Who would you shoot first?  Who gets it?  Hmm.  Who gets it?  I guess, you know, it's a toss-up.  If Danny's in the way, Danny takes a bullet.  Danny.  Why Danny?  Who's everybody on me today?  Well, you're in the room.  You're just the first person I saw.  I just shot Eric.  Yeah, you shot Eric.  Your name didn't even come up.  And I should tell you now that I so considered you first.  Why?  I don't know.  It just popped in my head.  I'm sorry, guys.  I don't mean to mess up this bit, but you won't get through.  What do you mean?  Yeah, it's bulletproof windows and doors and walls and...  Ugh. 
[04:07:30]  Jesus.  Wow.  That was...  You missed a car crash.  It was a car crash.  Yeah, there's dog fur that's just flooded.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right, well, that would have been a great bit for another 20 minutes.  Oh, well, we're done with that one.  No, it's all right.  No, it's all right.  It's cool.  So where were we?  Danny?  Danny, right.  Parked your car.  But no, no, Danny followed in Poe's car.  Right.  And then they drove back together, and Danny, I guess, had a problem with the fragrance of Poe's car. 
[04:08:00]  It's a little funky.  A little funky.  Is it dog?  I suppose.  Yeah.  I suppose.  I know that Poe does have a few dogs.  What kind of dogs are they?  Three dogs.  What kind?  Bulldogs.  Oh, so they slobber a lot.  Big dog balls.  No?  They're just big.  Big dog balls.  Their tails poke straight up so their assholes rub on the seat.  You don't even get the tail protection.  People are amazing at their fucking dogs.  They hop up on the couch at their house and stuff, and their actual asshole, where the dog shit comes from, is on the couch. 
[04:08:30]  And then people will lay there with their face on the couch, where the dog asshole was just, like, rubbing.  That's okay, because it's dog.  Just put your face on your dog's asshole, because that's what you're doing.  My dogs have their own couch.  Your dogs have their own couch?  Yeah, they have their own couch, yeah.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Fabulous.  We're done with the car thing?  The spinning wheel of hate. 
[04:09:00]  Did you happen to tune in at all?  No!  To the Pal Talk pajama party the girls had?  No.  I tuned in for a little while.  I think it was on Saturday night.  Saturday night.  Yeah, I think I was out Friday night.  I don't remember.  Yeah, Saturday night, so I tune in.  And, you know, there's a couple of the hot girls from Pal Talk running around.  And then, I don't know who else they brought.  There were some filler girls, let's just say. 
[04:09:30]  Some filler girls in there.  They were doing, like, because it was in Happy Typing Girls, one of the girls that, she threw the whole thing.  And she works at a photography studio.  So a few of them were by the area where they do the pictures, doing little photo shoots, like laying down in their little pajamas and stuff, doing photo shoots.  And then you'd be watching that, and then you'd go to another camera, and there's stalker Patty with her jaw open.  Because apparently when she types and reads on the computer, she has to open her mouth and stare like a mongoloid. 
[04:10:00]  So all you see is her face in the camera typing.  I wanted to punch my monitor.  I actually did talk to, I forgot at the end of the night, I did talk to Happy Typing Girl and a couple of others.  And she said it was a big smash, but they were all in bed by the time I talked to her.  Really?  What time did they go to bed?  I was late, it was like 5 in the morning. 
[04:10:30]  Must have been late.  They were all drinking, though, which was good.  So this was live on Pal Talk?  Yeah.  Was there nudity?  How were the PJs?  I didn't see any nudity.  Some of them more revealing than others, which was good.  They were wowing.  So they were, you know, they were showing some breasts.  And then the more they drank, the more they wrestled with each other, too.  There was a lot of girl wrestling going on, where they're in their PJs pinning each other down and things like that.  And doing their photo shoots together, kind of hugging each other and stuff. 
[04:11:00]  So that was kind of cool.  Yeah, this is not just a radio show anymore.  It's like, I don't know, a lifestyle.  It's a cult.  It's kind of like a cult.  It's an experience that continues after we go off the air.  And I guess through the Pal Talk cameras, they had a little sleepover party that people were able to check out all over the country.  Girls had the slumber party.  It was a four-camera shoot going on in there.  So they really had a lot of coverage on the place.  And, yeah, you could just pop in and watch it.  I told her she would have turned Patty away.  I told her that would have been so great. 
[04:11:30]  She shows up with her bags and her high hopes for a fun weekend of chips and laughter, and you send her home.  Beat it, aunt.  I would have liked it if the first time she got on camera, they poured pig blood all over her.  Carrie.  Is it true that Master Poe volunteered his services for the party?  Yeah, yeah, you know, Master Poe said because, you know, well, ladies, you've announced this on the air.  Perhaps I could go and give you security. 
[04:12:00]  No, he didn't.  Yeah, I guess he rocks.  I don't believe that.  That is the sorriest excuse to get into a pajama party full of girls that I've ever heard.  God bless Master Poe.  Poe, you know.  No, it wasn't even like it was something that you were trying â€“ you didn't even try to come up with something.  He also made the same offer to McGreevy years ago.  You know, you're going to the bathroom late at night.  It's very dangerous.  It would be very dangerous in those bookstores, gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  No, gentlemen, I'm very protective when it comes to women, and I did offer my services. 
[04:12:30]  Why?  I didn't want anything.  Why did you really offer your services?  Because that's the way I am.  Have you seen what happens?  Because occasionally guys with masks that are stretched and have big mouths stab these women to death.  I've watched movies.  They need security.  So what were you going to do?  Where were you going to stand?  Well, there's two different rooms.  You are not going to admit on the show that it was secure â€“ make sure they were safe?  Gentlemen, I wouldn't be out in the open.  I would be underneath the desks the girls are using to type. 
[04:13:00]  That way the perpetrators would not see me.  It's just in.  There's going to be a gay slumber party, and they're looking for your services.  Are you going to help them out as well?  No, would you help them out?  No, that's okay.  Guys can take care of these jokes.  Hey, that's what I'm saying.  At least admit that there was an ulterior motive.  Ulterior motive?  Of course there was.  Who are you kidding?  It was a pajama party with mostly hot girls from Pal Talk?  I volunteered my nose in case a chair broke.  And do you know that happy typing girl was too scared to tell you no?  Really?  She was afraid of me. 
[04:13:30]  Yes, she was.  She wanted to say no, but she couldn't.  What happened?  Now it's out there.  You shouldn't fear the Po.  E-Rock, what do you got?  Fear of the Po.  The Po's not dangerous.  Well, when he first told me about this, he was asking me who this girl was, and he said,  oh, I offered my services for the party.  Then he proceeded to tell me that his logic for it was that, you know, all these girls  that are in the room there, every guy's going to know where they are, so they'll just start  showing up, and I'll run the door and screen the door so they don't come in.  Do you know where that is?  No.  Do I know?  Do you know where that is?  Yes.  Jimmy probably does. 
[04:14:00]  Anyone else that's been on Pal Talk, do you have any idea where that studio is that  she does Pal Talk from every day and this party was at?  No.  This just in.  There was a serious threat of a pillow fight breaking out.  Gentlemen, I wanted to be there.  Were you going to bring some fluffy nunchucks and hit the girls with them?  Pillows are sharp sometimes.  You can put an eye out.  I don't blame Paul.  I'm not saying he's right.  I do.  I don't blame him at all.  No one even knew where the party was.  I don't blame him because I know he had a complete ulterior motive. 
[04:14:30]  Oh, okay.  If he actually thought anyone was going to fall for this security thing at a pajama party  that no one knows where it's even at.  That no one knows, yeah.  It's in a warehouse somewhere, basically.  It's like NORAD.  They were holding the party at NORAD.  Hey, can I help, gentlemen?  Perhaps, uh...  So were you at the party?  No.  No.  Did you watch any of the party?  No, I didn't go.  You didn't go.  No?  Well, she emailed me and she said that she didn't need my service. 
[04:15:00]  She finally got the issue.  You know what to tell you.  Poe, if you were concerned of their safety, though,  Yes.  couldn't you have watched the entire thing on PalTalk  and if you saw something happen, be the first one to dial the authorities?  Um...  No, I don't watch PalTalk.  See, why wouldn't...  I don't watch PalTalk.  But that would have been keeping them safe.  I feel that if I'm there, present, if I'm in the room or outside of the room, in the area, 
[04:15:30]  I...  He was going to walk the perimeter.  Much more...  I heard he was going to just walk the perimeter.  The Spitting Wheel of Hate.  Master Poe, and with all due respect, Poe,  you kind of would run after a female dog because it's female.  Wow.  You're kind of known around this place to be a little flirtatious,  to look at a lot of the girls and stuff,  so it's hard to really gauge how much, you know, if you're just being Poe.  Let's just put it this way.  He does a lot of his dating in the back parking lot at FH Ryder. 
[04:16:00]  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  Why is everyone looking away?  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, Poe, the FH doesn't mean fuck here.  Oh!  No, you didn't!  No, you didn't!  Poe, poe, boo, boe, banana, nana, banana, fanna, foe, foe, fee, fi, mo, mo, poe! 
[04:16:30]  Oosh!  The Spitting Wheel of Hate!  Well, that's all the time we have today for the Spitting Wheel of Hate.  I've been your host, Roland.  Good night, everyone.  Boos!  Yeah!
