<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Anthony recounting a bizarre trip to a Renaissance Festival.  He detailed the overwhelmingly white crowd, the questionable fashion choices (lots of cleavage and clashing outfits), and his and Gus's antics, which included rogue archery, hatchet throwing, and excessive sausage-eating photography.  He noted the presence of "geeks," bikers, and the incongruity of modern concessions like pizza. Callers shared their own Ren Fest experiences and offered mead-related trivia, contributing to the hosts' mocking commentary on the attendees.  This segment also featured a studio birthday cake for Jimmy Norton, which was unexpectedly used in a prank targeting a studio guest, "Stalker Patty." The prank involved smearing cake on Patty's back, leading to a drawn-out, chaotic sequence involving her (unbroken) glasses and increasingly absurd attempts at remedy by the hosts and other studio guests, No Filter Paul and E-Rock, who were also present. The segment ended with a visibly upset Patty lamenting the cost of replacing her glasses.


The show then transitioned to a heated discussion surrounding the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus show and the fallout involving comedian Louis Twitchell. It began with a crude, sexually suggestive exchange between the hosts and Patty involving mousetraps and a rat trap.  Listeners' money was collected to incentivize Patty's participation in increasingly uncomfortable acts, culminating in her briefly handling Jimmy Norton's penis while wearing a glove.  The main focus shifted to Twitchell's emotional breakdown in the hotel lobby following the show, described as involving crying and frantic phone calls.  The hosts, along with road manager Kenny and Pat Fuminaki (who shared a room and car with Twitchell), offered conflicting accounts of a confrontation between Kenny and Twitchell.  Twitchell claimed verbal abuse from Kenny, while Kenny denied this, with Pat corroborating some aspects of Kenny's version, portraying Twitchell as erratic and overly emotional. Twitchell later joined the show by phone, escalating the argument and trading insults with Kenny.


A further segment delved deeper into the conflict between Kenny and Twitchell, who has Tourette's Syndrome. Twitchell alleged that Kenny was verbally abusive backstage, calling him a "nobody" and implying he belonged in the "petting zoo" area rather than the main stage. He also mentioned smoking marijuana beforehand. Pat, a witness, gave a less damning account, acknowledging Kenny’s intimidating demeanor but not hearing the harshest insults.  The hosts attempted to mediate, conducting phone calls with both parties, but Twitchell became increasingly emotional and agitated, admitting to paranoia from the marijuana. Kenny maintained he was firm but not abusive and offered Twitchell the option to leave.  Listener calls offered conflicting character testimonies regarding Kenny’s behavior, concluding with Twitchell needing a break from the show due to stress and the conflict remaining unresolved.


Later, comedians Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane joined the show. They discussed their comedic careers, Voss detailing his difficult childhood, drug addiction, and career struggles.  The conversation covered hecklers, career challenges, and the commitment required for success in stand-up comedy.  Callers seeking advice on their comedic aspirations or other personal issues (smoking addiction, compulsive eBay purchases) were also featured.  Voss and McFarlane engaged in playful banter and disagreements with both callers and each other.


The final segment featured a series of listener calls interspersed with the hosts' often rambling and vulgar commentary. Recurring themes included discussions about comedian Kid Africa, the struggles of struggling comedians (including "barking"), and the hosts' experiences with defective eBay purchases.  Guest Rich offered advice to callers on various issues. Anthony shared a hyperbolic and violent (in his recounting) anecdote about a perceived home invasion that turned out to be his girlfriend’s computer, involving him in his underwear and a Nazi-themed jacket.  The segment also included mentions of a fake Louis Vuitton wallet incident, with frequent use of racial slurs and homophobic language, and a generally crude and irreverent tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You're listening to the worst worst. Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is the fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's pretty stupid.  A lot of people are dressed up in renaissance attire and talking like they did in the olden days.  And you buy, you know, a yard of mead and you can get a big turkey leg to eat if you want.  And there are wenches walking around with their bosoms pushed up in corsets. 
[00:00:30]  Did you or did you not dress up?  I absolutely did not dress up.  You have dressed up in past years, haven't you?  I never went to the renaissance festival and dressed up.  I just don't do it.  So you're not a LARPer?  No.  I've dressed for Halloween as like a renaissance guy.  But that was just a goof.  But it's Halloween, so you're getting an excuse.  It was just a goof, right?  It's Halloween.  So you weren't walking around the renaissance festival like a LARPer? 
[00:01:00]  No.  You weren't LARPing?  No.  They have the people that work there that dress up.  What do black people do during this awful time?  Well, let me tell you something.  Anyway, I was hanging out, me, my girlfriend, a couple of her girlfriends, and one of the girlfriend's boyfriends, Gus.  Very cool guy.  It kind of gives me somebody to talk to while the girls are, you know, going buying.  Because they all bought, like, costumes and stuff and dressed up. 
[00:01:30]  So they dressed up?  The girls dress up.  Yeah.  And they walk around.  And then we walk around.  The girls are dressed up.  And, you know, they got little shops.  And you buy little things.  And you watch, you know, the things go on.  They got the jousts and sword fights and things going on like that.  And so me and Gus pretty much just goof on everything that's going on there.  And he goes, you notice something?  Like, what?  He goes, well, you know, lack of something.  I'm like, oh, okay. 
[00:02:00]  Black people.  Isn't the future great?  They don't.  The future.  Oh, excuse me.  Wrong joke.  Apparently, black people, not very interested in the Renaissance Festival.  Why would they?  I know.  And Gus brought up a good point.  It's like anything before the Emancipation Proclamation is nothing but pain and slavery and conquering.  So I don't think they like being involved with that kind of thing.  A lot of white people, a lot of bikers for some reason are into it. 
[00:02:30]  A lot of geeks are into it.  So, you know, you get people that like sci-fi that are into it.  And I don't know.  You just walk around.  It's entertaining.  I took a lot of pictures.  But all the pictures I took are of most of them anyway.  They sell these huge sausages on a stick.  And they're just giant.  I swear they have to be a foot long and as thick as if you made a fist. 
[00:03:00]  And all I was doing was taking pictures of girls biting into these things and guys alike.  Do you have these pictures for the website?  Those and the chocolate-covered bananas.  Yeah.  I got a few.  Those and the chocolate-covered bananas.  We followed some guy around for I don't know how long until he actually took a bite and  got a big picture of him putting his mouth over this thing and then feeding it to another  guy.  It was fantastic.  And these big fat women. 
[00:03:30]  We got this one.  She had just bought it at the stand.  Yeah.  And her eyes are open so wide and her mouth is open wide and she's shoving this big sausage  in her mouth.  You got to make your entertainment where you can.  Where was this?  How far from New York?  It's about an hour or so drive in the tuxedo New York.  Someone from their cell phone renaissance festival where people go to be medieval faggots.  Oh, there are some people go all out. 
[00:04:00]  I mean like almost full suits of armor.  And then there's the guys that want to be like wear tights and like Shakespearean type  outfits and it's just nothing but it looks like they're trying to steal a pumpkin from  the Lord down the front of their tights.  It's like could you put on a kilt or something?  Could you cover that up?  There's no reason to walk around like that.  There's no reason to walk around at all up there. 
[00:04:30]  Well, it's a renaissance festival.  There's a fine reason to walk through the renaissance.  Here, take this ye.  Well, there is a little fun to be had after you've had a few yards of ale.  What you do is you go over by the archery, which is they give you like 25 arrows for a  few bucks and a bow and you shoot into hay bales.  Are you trying to make this sound cool?  No, no.  Jimmy, are you listening to this?  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  You're trying to make this sound cool.  It's like, well, after a few yards, meaning I'm hammered now.  Yeah.  Let me tell you how cool it is.  You catch a little buzz.  You grab your arrows and your bow.  Oh, you get to shoot arrows into hay.  See, but you don't shoot it into the hay.  See, me and Gus were shooting it over the top of the backdrop into the woods where we heard  things and traffic, so I'm not sure if maybe we've injured somebody or trying to hit the  wooden boundary railing that you're not supposed to be aiming for. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  And I said we'd make the news if we all just turned around and shot one person in the chest  with the arrows.  That would kind of...  Well, you know, eventually that's going to happen and then it's going to be no more  arrows for everybody.  No more arrows.  Then this hatchet throwing at targets.  You know, you pick up your hatchet and you give it a good throw.  And I got to purchase a brand new rapier.  So I have a new one to add to my rapier collection.  When you swing that, are you a rapiest? 
[00:06:00]  No, rapiest, yes, that's what they call me.  Those will be proudly displayed in my office.  I just think it's funny you got stuck with a guy named Gus.  Gus is a good egg.  I'm sure he's fantastic, but did you have to go, hey, Gus, check this out.  Gus.  Change your name.  Gustav.  He looks like Himmler.  He's German and looks like Himmler.  So it's kind of fun to hang around with him.  He knows a lot about German history.  Fun guy.  I remind you this morning that we are shock jocks. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  He's just shocking.  A lot of friends, though.  I got to say, I have never been.  Look, you see, here we go.  Never been to an event aside from an ONA event where I've seen and had more ONA fans come  up to me and recognize me from the show and love the show than at the Renaissance Fair.  We must be failing pretty badly.  I don't have to pay for anything.  I mean, people come up.  I go, you know, give me like a beer or something. 
[00:07:00]  Just get it.  Just get it for free.  They're great.  Nice people.  But I hear they were stepping out of character and stuff.  Yeah, that kind of ruins it a little bit.  Yeah, I see.  It ruins it for Anthony at the Renaissance Festival.  He really wants everyone in character around him.  I'm in line.  And, you know, the guy behind the bar is like, you know, to the guy in front of me, is like,  Ah, my lord, would you, would thou like a yard of mead?  Would you like some mead, some honey mead? 
[00:07:30]  Ah, yes.  Anything for the lady, sir?  All right.  You know, so I go up there and it's like, dude, love the show.  Dude, have a bud.  You know, you guys were doing that bit the other day.  It's, what happened to the accent?  Where's the character?  I want the guy, the hello, me lord.  Well, they also want the guy.  Yeah.  That they think they know from the radio show.  So you both lost.  You both lost on that one. 
[00:08:00]  They're expecting impersonations and fun.  And shuckery.  And instead they get, ugh.  Hey, they were there too.  They were working.  They all enjoy it.  Even the people working there.  I see it like a big carny gypsy thing where I picture at night, they're all just having  sex with each other and drinking the leftover mead.  They're like gypsies from the 1700s or something.  Why do they call it mead?  I don't know.  It's different from beer, mead. 
[00:08:30]  I was just drinking, you know, bud.  So it's a beer product?  Yeah, I think it is.  It's some kind of weird beer wine mix thing.  I don't know.  But they have wine.  And in past years, they had really kind of adhered to the whole medieval thing.  But I'm starting to notice they're changing a few things.  Like you used to get, you know, the turkey leg was pretty much all you could get or some  other things, a bowl made out of some baked bread with some gruel in it, like some soup 
[00:09:00]  or something.  And now you look up and there's Ye Tony's Pizza.  You know, it kind of takes away from the whole thing.  And there's people dressed up, you know, I think I saw a Klingon.  It's like, could you leave the sci-fi, you know, expo garb out of the Renaissance thing?  Keep it, you know, in the right era.  You know, you're right.  When I go LARPing.  I wasn't LARPing.  I was at a Renaissance festival.  Well, one of the biggest.  I want everyone to be LARPing in the same era. 
[00:09:30]  When you go up there, are you in a town that is just kind of decided to transform itself?  Well, the whole town is very small.  It's a very small town.  So everywhere you go, there are people in Renaissance attire getting ready to go to  the big Renaissance fair, which is held at the same location.  And they have little shows that they put on.  There's like an acrobat guy and other medieval type entertainment events.  Why don't they let it go?  It's been a long time since the medieval. 
[00:10:00]  People seem to enjoy that time and dressing up and acting like that for some reason.  It's silly.  There's no medical knowledge.  It was just an awful time.  Well, that's what I said.  They should have done that.  Like, you know, they'd lop someone's head off and then have some guy come over and just  put a few leeches on it.  Something like the real old school medicine.  But people just seem to enjoy that, that whole era and the attire and acting like that.  I don't know why. 
[00:10:30]  That's just some English people there and thought it would be weird for them to see a bunch  of Americans acting like, you know, their old culture.  Yeah.  That it would be weird if maybe in England they have some kind of a thing where they auction  off people and do things like we did here.  All right.  Let's go to the phone and say hi to Hunter and Wayne.  Hunter, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Anthony, if you actually said that, if you're admitting on the air that you went to a Renaissance  fair, basically at this point, to quote Tony Soprano, he's a fig. 
[00:11:00]  Why would that be?  Why?  I go just about every year.  Okay.  It's fun to go with friends.  You have fun and you get to, and I'm not saying I don't have a good time there, but you do  get to make fun of a lot of people that are there.  Yeah.  Opie, when you went pumpkin picking, you may just make Opie's pumpkin picking look cool.  He went with his girlfriend.  And Gus.  And Gus.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  Meaning his girlfriend was his beard because Gus was there.  Gus was his real date.  Gus was his real date.  Gus was not my date.  We got to commiserate a bit.  What was it?  Gus and Elmer?  Were you Elmer for the day?  No, I was not Elmer.  Was that the name of those?  The old couple?  The old gay guys?  Was it Gus and Elmer?  It was Gus and Elmer.  Did Gus buy a sausage and then smack your face with it?  He didn't buy it.  Hey, this isn't sausage.  Anybody who was really cool was at the beach yesterday, like Opie. 
[00:12:00]  All right, yeah.  Oh, wow, man.  All right, man.  Yeah, real cool.  Where were you, Hunter?  I was at Sandy Hook yesterday.  Doing what?  Just getting myself a nice tan.  Yeah, nice, man.  I hope you get skin cancer.  It was one of the last nice beach days of the year.  Oh, there's a stupid beach around here.  Thank you, bro.  Thank you.  That's Hunter.  Green water.  You can't see your belly button through the water.  Oh, you don't know anything.  Oh, I know everything about the goddamn beach.  You don't know where to go.  The water's too effing cold. 
[00:12:30]  The weather's too cold to go to the beach.  You don't know where to go.  The beach is full of convicts.  You don't know where to go.  You don't know where to go.  That's Jones Beach.  I don't go there.  That's Jones Beach.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric.  What's up, fellas?  Make it fast.  Come on.  I just want to let you know that mead is beer made from honey.  Oh, Steve should have come running in telling us that.  Oh, beer made from honey?  Beer made from honey.  It's wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Beer made from honey.  All right.  There were a lot of bees there yesterday.  Let's go to Brenda. 
[00:13:00]  Very frightening.  Brenda.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  Hi, Brenda.  Hey.  First of all, mead is honey, sweet honey wine.  I work at the bars.  I already know it.  I know.  And secondly, Anthony, I was the crazy girl who gave you the pin at the end of the day.  Yes.  She came running out at the end of the day and gave me a nice Opie and Anthony Wow pin.  A lot of fans.  Do you work there every year, miss?  I've worked there for the last 15 years of my life because I'm a loser.  15 years.  What's your job at the Renaissance Festival? 
[00:13:30]  I serve beer at the restaurant.  I serve me.  Say something.  Can you say something in older talk, lady?  No.  I gave up my accent like 10 years ago.  Well, come on.  She gave it up.  What do you say?  She just said, screw it.  Good day, everybody.  I don't know.  I gave it up.  It's too early to be doing this.  Come on, ye.  Give us something.  Something from the Renaissance there.  Give us what you used to.  When you used to have a passion for it and someone would come up and go, what do you have today, m'lady?  Actually, I have them come up, and it used to be, what be thy thirst? 
[00:14:00]  What be thy thirst?  What be thy thirst?  What be thy thirst?  And then it goes into the Budweiser, Sam Adams.  Yeah, real old-fashioned.  Real old-y time beers.  All right, Brandon.  Thank you.  Let's go to Phlegm in Jersey.  Phlegm, what's up?  Shoot ye self.  Exactly.  Phlegm.  It's a whole day looking at hooters there, man, and cleavage. 
[00:14:30]  That's what you do.  How many times does your girlfriend catch you?  You know, the girls wrap themselves up in these corsets and squeeze their bosoms out of the top so you see a lot of cleavage.  It's all you do there, man.  It's like you just walk around looking at these women squirting their breasts at you.  But some of the guys don't want to, like, I refuse to dress up.  I've been asked many times, I refuse.  And then it's like, well, just wear this hat.  Or just wear this. 
[00:15:00]  I go, no, because you either have to go all out and wear the complete thing or just wear regular clothes.  Because it would be even sillier than dressing up totally would be the guy, because you see him walking around all the time.  He's got the jeans, the sneakers, and he's wearing, like, an oldie-time chainmail vest and a helmet.  It's like, what are you?  But you're wearing jeans and sneakers.  Either go all out or don't do it at all. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, Jimmy and I agree.  When you're LARPing, you've got to go all out.  If you don't LARPing.  If it's not 100% LARPing, then you don't LARP at all in my book.  See, LARPing is role-playing.  Is it?  It's when you actually do what most people do online games with points and stuff.  And that's a whole game thing.  Two damage!  Two damage!  Two damage!  Right.  That is not happening at the Renaissance Festival.  What are some of the other things you could yell out at your fellow LARPer?  Two damage!  Two damage! 
[00:16:00]  You could yell, I'm a douche.  And they cast a spell with a beanbag.  I know they cast spells with beanbags.  They yell, we're faggots.  We're faggots.  Well, yeah, you won't hear me defending the LARPers.  But I have fun at the Renaissance Festival.  Yeah.  It's, you know.  All right.  Do ye.  Ye do.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We're just getting warmed up.  I would throw in lines from Superman.  Yeah.  Because they're all geeky and they know them. 
[00:16:30]  And I would throw in Zod lines.  Like, they would ask you something.  Because people just come up to you and go,  Have thou seen my husband?  Like, trying to get some role-playing thing going.  Yeah.  And they'll ask you about, like, why you're wearing such strange clothing.  So I'd give them the old,  Why do you ask these questions when you know I shall kill you for it?  Remember Zod from Superman?  Yeah, I do.  And they look so puzzled.  No.  It was to get a complete puzzled look.  You finally leave your house and this is what you do?  It was a complete puzzled look you would get from these Renaissance Fair people. 
[00:17:00]  But we would all laugh because we knew what it was.  Yeah, of course.  That's wonderful, Anthony.  Here's how you should answer that.  It's General Zod.  Yeah, it sure is.  What do they say to you?  Leaves his house for the first time in five years to do this.  They would say something like, you go,  Excuse me, where are the bathrooms?  And they go, well, does thou wish to take the bath?  And you're like, you know, you just want to take a whiz.  Now the Zod line coming up?  No, no. 
[00:17:30]  Then they would go, oh, you must be looking for the privy.  For the privy.  And you laugh and you go.  I would say this.  I wish you were dead.  If they asked me a question that they wanted to role play, I wish you were dead.  I got something.  Yes?  Thou is bored.  No, it's fun.  Thou is bored.  Jimmy?  I probably wouldn't dig it.  I would go for the goof factor.  Just have a laugh.  It is really fun.  And I tell you, when you go with friends, it is very fun because you do. 
[00:18:00]  There are plenty of things to just go, oh, my God, look at that, and goof on.  All right.  Let's go to one more call and then we take a break here.  Dale, Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  I love the show, guys.  Two damage.  Two damage.  No, I just wanted to see if Anthony saw the guy that looked like Scott Weiland walking  around with a tambourine at the fair.  Was he the guy that tried to look like Captain Jack Sparrow?  No, no, no, no.  This guy had a bandana on. 
[00:18:30]  He had one boot on and one sandal on.  And he was walking around like a freak shaking a tambourine.  Yeah, they got a lot of, like, old hippies and weirdos there.  And then there was a, yeah, Jack Sparrow walking around, which was like, now they've introduced  pirates.  Now they've introduced pirates to the Renaissance.  And you would know the difference, right?  Is pirates a Klingon?  I would just assume pirates were part of the whole thing.  I don't know.  I wish.  No.  See?  No.  There weren't.  There usually weren't pirates.  I would be like, well, that pirate looks like the dress of the day. 
[00:19:00]  So there must have been pirates.  Next year, I plan on screwing the whole thing up by taking a bunch of people dressed in original  classic Star Trek attire.  Oh, no.  And saying that we beam down to this planet where it's exactly like Renaissance era Earth  and just scan people with the tricorder and medical equipment and say how we can't talk  about what we're doing here because it would violate the prime directive.  And hit them with your plastic swords.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I have a phaser. 
[00:19:30]  Why would I do that?  I would have a phaser.  That would be silly.  So that would be three damage?  That would be silly.  Because that would be a little more powerful than a plastic sword.  Instant dead.  You warping faggots out there.  1,600 damage.  He'd be dead.  I cast a spell.  Bam!  With my bean bag.  Anthony, what is it that they yell out when you give them a tip?  Huzzah!  Huzzah.  What is that?  Huzzah!  To the tipper.  Huzzah, indeed.  Huzzah. 
[00:20:00]  When you give a little tip after you're done getting your beer, you give it to them and  they ring a bell.  Cling, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.  Huzzah!  To the generous tipper.  Nice.  Love the show, guys.  Gotta work for a little bit.  Take it easy.  Yes, Jimmy.  They do an appreciation for the tip.  Huzzah!  Why do thou look at me like that?  That's the noise you should make when you wake up and realize there's a large gentleman 
[00:20:30]  straddling you in your bed and you feel a sharp, wincing pain.  And that's what wakes you up.  Huzzah!  Huzzah!  Should be the sound that comes out of your mouth.  Let's go to James in New Hampshire.  James.  Hey, Jimmy, Opie.  Yeah.  I just have to know, how are you fighting off the urge to give him an atomic wedgie?  You high school geek.  Yeah, we're going to have Club Soda Kenny give you a wedgie.  I will not get a wedgie for attending the Renaissance Festival. 
[00:21:00]  Many people do.  It's a very popular event every year.  It's on for weeks, a couple of weeks, and it does very well.  Yeah, all right.  I think I stuffed you in a locker at least twice in high school.  You did not, tough guy.  And had guns.  I have a brand new rapier I'll run ye through.  Two damage!  Two damage!  Two damage.  All right, let's take a break.  Just getting warmed up. 
[00:21:30]  Let us taketh thine breaks.  Huzzah!  Huzzah to the break.  Huzzah!  No?  All right, it's the one virus spreading across the land.  The realm.  The shire.  Give me some beanbags so I can cast spells all morning.  Sorry, Mike Cutback Davis. 
[00:22:00]  Those guys are fags.  What?  I'm using surfer names for you.  Oh, I don't know a surfer.  Crap, I just like waves.  It's just from past times.  Come here, miss.  Huzzah!  Huzzah!  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is David Tell.  I'm the new intern on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Can I do this more cop-like?  Hey, this is David Tell.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  They suck. 
[00:22:30]  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Did I just fart?  Hey, we've got to get No Filter Paul in here and bam, they've got a present for you, Anthony.  What?  Let's bring in No Filter Paul and bam.  Unless it's a new throat.  Jesus.  Do you want some throat coat?  No.  Well, you've got to give them some props.  They organized the whole thing outside the other studio. 
[00:23:00]  Throat coat tea.  Yes?  Is very...  I have some throat yogurt for you, but throat coat is a tea.  Or cake.  Called, uh...  And stalker paddy.  Come on in.  What the hell?  Yeah, you.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Thanks for showing up today.  Anytime.  Anytime.  Yes, boys.  That mic sounds awful, E-Rock, and you would know that if you had headphones on.  That's right, E-Rock.  We tell you time and time again, put headphones on.  What do you do?  Nothing. 
[00:23:30]  Nothing.  That's okay.  I'll share it with Paul.  Lovely.  All right.  E-Rock's got a nice racing stripe down both sleeves.  I don't know if anybody noticed that.  Yeah.  He does.  Looks like a man who hit the lottery to me.  So what do you guys got today?  You guys got all over the news this morning.  Yeah, we heard it.  There was tons of reporters there.  Yeah.  First time we were in front of a camera.  Wait, who was outside there?  Because we had to make the walk.  There was a lot of photographers. 
[00:24:00]  There was a few video crews, right?  There was Daily News.  Channel 11.  What?  Channel 11.  Channel 11 were there.  Yeah, WB was there.  Another television wasn't sure which one that was.  And then there was a bunch of like the AP photographers there.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Cool.  The wire stuff.  And you brought a present for Anthony on his fine birthday?  I'm sick and I'm cranky.  We brought a birthday cake.  Yeah?  We brought a birthday cake.  You guys should put out like an O&A fan fitness tape.  Yeah.  What are you saying there, Bill? 
[00:24:30]  I'm just saying.  You know, Jimmy and I-  Maybe it's just the ones who come down to the studio.  No.  Jimmy and I were talking about this.  We went to see Dane Cook at the-  What are they calling it now in Boston?  The Garden?  It's back to the garden, sort of.  The Enormo Dome.  And he was doing his HBO special.  They were doing the whole taping, right?  And Jimmy and I were looking around like, what is different between his fans and our fans?  I want to fuck his fans.  From row A to row quadruple B. 
[00:25:00]  It's amazing.  It looks like they have no problem staying on the Fat Smash Diet.  They really don't.  They're all young and full of life.  Full of energy and fun.  And our fans are one cigarette away from a massive heart attack.  Yeah.  Look at these guys.  Less than that.  Less than that.  That's a great-  Oh!  It's a birthday cake.  Why don't we get some pictures of the birthday cake for the website?  Oh, that is very funny. 
[00:25:30]  It says-  It's a visual, people.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  It says, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, boys.  Because everyone knows-  It's my birthday.  And they tried to steal my thunder, but-  That's very nice.  Very funny.  It's always Jimmy's birthday.  All right, we'll be cutting that up.  Why don't we open up the lid?  That would be really nice.  I really shouldn't, but you know, since the facts-  You should.  You know what?  Because it has nice pink frosting, Jimmy.  Good point, Bill.  Good point.  Pass it-  Jimmy, this is going to be your third dessert of the morning.  I can't have it all, but you shouldn't.  A little piece only.  Pass it around. 
[00:26:00]  I'm telling you.  Pass it around.  Let everybody see it.  Steve.  Steve is stealing Dane Cook's look.  I'm not.  Yes, you are.  You look like his head shot.  No, I don't.  Yes.  Yeah, someone should do that photo shot.  I like how you just went with total denial.  No, I'm not.  I've never seen his head shot.  Steve, how did it go over the other place there?  What do you think?  It's kind of crazy, but we'll get into it.  Yeah, I thought we did pretty good.  Yeah, we did fine.  All right.  Also, Storker Patty, why don't you step up to that microphone?  You got something for Anthony as well?  Hi, Anthony. 
[00:26:30]  Hi, buddy.  I know you're going to have a very early commute in the morning, so I brought something to help  you along.  You know, it's going to be like flourless chocolate cake.  Something awful.  Patty, Keith pointed out something.  Your dumper looks good in those pants.  Yeah.  With your little Janis Joplin.  Yeah.  Your dumper looks really good.  My dumper?  Yeah.  What's my dumper?  Your turd cutter.  Coffee.  Espresso beans and a Starbucks coffee cup.  Very good. 
[00:27:00]  I know you're going to want coffee for your early morning commute.  Of course I am, Patty.  Thank you.  Get the knife.  You're welcome.  So much.  Very practical gift.  Oh, it's so practical.  Thank you.  I wanted us to know that her mitts were around that.  Why don't we have Patty cut the cake for everybody?  Patty, cut the cake.  Why don't we get a knife for Patty?  Why not?  I completely agree.  Why don't we have psycho Bill Shoverface in it?  Oh, Jesus.  No.  No, we wouldn't do that.  That was worse.  It's terrible. 
[00:27:30]  Once again, you are an idiot, Bill.  Once again.  Hey, um.  And you wonder why that phone's not ringing.  You know, why are you coming in at night?  I really am the fucking worst.  You are the bit ruiner.  We've discussed this in the past.  Just cut it.  All right.  Oh, it'll have the same effect.  Do you watch?  It will.  I'm watching.  I want a piece, Patty.  I'm not going to do anything. 
[00:28:00]  Patty, I want a corner.  Scared.  Oh, you stop being scared.  The E.T. body cuts the cake.  You cut the cake.  Let me have a corner.  Patty, cut me a corner.  Oh, corner for Jimmy.  Give me a corner.  Jimmy, how many desserts?  All right, okay.  I really shouldn't.  Jimmy.  Oh, this cage thing.  Oh, no.  No, don't be.  I'm dressed for work. 
[00:28:30]  I can't.  You've got time to get home.  Don't worry.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Wait.  No, no.  No, no.  Oh, no.  I'm dressed for work.  She's dressed for work.  Don't come near me.  I have to go to work after this, okay?  At 12.30.  Yeah, 12.30.  Two months at 12.30.  Still plenty of time.  12.30.  Yes, I do.  What time do you work?  12.30.  I think the listeners could raise money for new clothes.  No.  Here's the deal.  No.  You're 10 feet from the door. 
[00:29:00]  When I say go, we'll give you a chance.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Someone say go.  You get three seconds to run to the door.  Bam.  Open the door.  No.  No.  Ready?  No.  Set.  Go.  Set.  1,000.  You get three seconds.  Bam will open the door.  No.  Then I'll just start to run.  I can't.  No.  Why can't you?  No, because I'm dressed for work.  I don't have time to go home and change.  That cake is like 50 pounds.  I love you, old me.  I have to knock her over. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  I can't do it.  No.  All right.  Why don't you leave us there?  Mike, I'm shaking here.  I know.  I'll just put the cake down over here.  It's okay.  Yeah, put it down over there.  Why don't you take the knife out of it?  Psychopath.  Go, leave then.  Come on, Patty.  She's not leaving.  Run.  She's picking it back up.  Patty, you just ran.  No.  Just have the door open a little bit. 
[00:30:00]  How about like one piece?  No.  You're no fun anymore.  That's right.  She's clinging to people so she doesn't get hit.  All right, Patty.  I'm like shaking.  He's far enough away from it now.  He can never make it there before.  Get rid of that cheap cake.  We don't want to eat that anyway.  Nice $4 cake, you jizzbucket.  All right, go, Patty.  Leave.  Sheet cake.  It's a shit cake.  Leave before we're tempted.  Trust me.  Just leave before we're tempted. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, get rid of that cake there, you rock.  Patty, quick.  Run.  Run.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Oh, no.  That is a...  I have to go to work.  Oh, no.  Patty, don't cry.  Patty, don't cry.  Yeah, but you serve food at work.  Maybe they'll think you're just working hard.  Don't.  Don't.  You came in as a nice birthday. 
[00:31:00]  Don't cry and make us all really pleased.  No crying.  Oh, we relax.  She's crying.  Can you get a mic on her?  Because she's crying.  This is the worst.  Oh, my God.  She's crying.  You know who should cry?  Fucking E-Rock for his aim.  It had to bounce off the wall, you fucking girl arm.  Oh, wait.  E-Rock is very, very pissed off.  What's up, E-Rock?  Tell me.  Tell us.  Tell us.  This douchebag right here.  What happened?  We had it all set up, ready to go.  He's going, you should do it.  You should do it.  Right in front of her.  And then I go to do it. 
[00:31:30]  And he blocks my arm.  Yeah, bit ruiner.  Asshole.  Is it on video that no filter, Paul?  Blocking the shot.  I'm pushing away.  Patty.  I've got to get this off me before I go to work.  Oh, my God.  How are you going to get that off your pants?  Oh, no.  It's just on my pants and I wear an apron.  Yeah, it's all behind you, too.  No, Patty.  Turn around.  Let's see.  Let me see.  Patty.  There's nothing on your back.  Oh, dude.  That's fine.  You know what?  You're fine.  Patty has a nice ass.  You're fine. 
[00:32:00]  Thank God there's nothing on your back.  No, you're fine.  You're fine.  Take her to the bathroom.  I'm okay.  No.  And shoot her.  I just need a tissue to wipe my pants off.  That's all you need.  You're fine.  Why would you throw a cake at me or a piece?  I know.  I don't understand.  Where's my glasses, by the way?  Hey, let me know, by the way.  I did not throw the cake at Stark and Pat.  Where's my glasses, by the way?  I need them.  Can I...  You broke them.  No, let me...  Am I actually...  Let me clean off her glasses for her.  Oh, please.  I don't...  I can't afford...  Oh, no.  I can't see and I can't afford another... 
[00:32:30]  I can't see.  Sophie, please don't.  I don't have money for another pair of glasses.  Please.  Don't do...  Please.  Break the glasses.  I don't have money for another pair of glasses.  No, you can't break her glasses.  Please.  No, she has to work.  It's prescription glasses.  I can't see without them.  I'm legally blind.  It sounds like a bad play.  Oh, God.  This is horrible.  Well...  What's wrong, Jimmy? 
[00:33:00]  I can't...  Please don't break her glasses.  Sophie, can I please have my glasses back?  I hate her, but you can't break her glasses.  She has to see.  Please.  Can I have my glasses back?  What does she have to see?  I can't see.  Her awful life.  That is true.  What are you going to do?  Look at your bank account and get a car...  I can't leave without my glasses, Sophie, please.  Stop stepping on me.  I need them.  I have to see the register at work.  Let me wipe off your back.  Yeah.  Wipe off your back.  No.  Something she'll never hear again.  No, you don't wipe the back off.  You leave it on the back. 
[00:33:30]  What's wrong with people?  Go on, Danny.  You don't wipe it off.  These glasses don't look like their prescription, though, Patty.  They are.  Are you sure?  Yes.  Hmm.  That looks good, Patty.  No one will notice.  Actually, those are the glasses Maury Povic gave me.  Maury who?  Did he diddle you?  Because it seems like he's diddling everyone else over there.  Yeah, he's a little sexual.  Did you see anything crazy over there when you taped the Maury Povic show?  No.  He has his own TV show. 
[00:34:00]  He should be fucking someone on the side.  What's his name, Patty?  Yeah.  Who?  Can I please have my glasses?  Patty, who did you say?  Maury who?  I didn't hear you.  Yeah.  Maury Povic.  Maury Povic.  Oh, thank God I wear an apron.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  If you break the Moby, you're going to get me another pair of glasses so I can see.  Oh, don't do it.  Oh, no. 
[00:34:30]  Don't do it.  There's no way, you know.  I think even this show has a line.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Why is he lowering the microphone to the floor?  I can't see without my glasses.  Is Opie going to lay on the floor and broadcast?  Oh, no.  I have 2350 vision and one line 2400.  Shut up, would you?  Jesus Christ.  We get it.  You're blind.  Opie, if you do this, where can you go from here?  Please don't pull out my IV.  If he does that, he's buying me another pair of glasses. 
[00:35:00]  Please don't throw Arthur Ashe's blood in my face.  But what are you going to do today?  How are you going to work?  You're going to get fired.  Yeah.  How are you going to get home?  Well, I happen to be nearsighted.  Which means you can't see how far away?  I can't see far away, no.  Hey, does anyone have a hammer?  I don't think we have any hammers or mallets. 
[00:35:30]  No.  Patty, one of your toes.  Don't do it.  All I know is I won't be able to read.  Well, what do you have to read besides a checkbook with a zero in it?  An eviction notice.  Well, don't do it.  Oh.  You can't believe how happy and positive I was feeling a month away from this show.  Right?  Yeah.  Why'd you take your shoe off?  Do you have an itch?  All right, Khrushchev.  Oh!  Oh, no. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, Patty.  Now, he's going to get me another pair of glasses.  He got you that pair.  He's going to replace them.  Oh, yes, he will.  Oh, yes, he will.  He will get me another pair of glasses.  Oh, I think they can be fixed.  Oh, this is just not right.  This is cruel and unusual. 
[00:36:30]  You know, I think if you just put a piece of tape in the middle of them.  No, he's going to get me another brand new pair of glasses.  That's what he's going to do.  Stop trying to hold on to your dignity by being assertive.  He's going to get me glasses.  Who are you telling?  You're talking to the window, you nearsighted idiot.  Yeah, could you see him do it?  Not really.  Exactly.  She's looking at Bill Burr's elbow.  You're going to get me glasses.  No, everything is blurry far away. 
[00:37:00]  Well?  All right.  Well, thanks for giving Anthony a birthday gift.  Thank you, Patty.  Patty, do you need a tender sentiment?  Oh.  No, I need another pair of glasses.  Jimmy, pull out a tender sentiment for Patty.  Patty, this will help.  And make her read it.  Yeah, make her read it.  Read what?  Shut your mouth.  A tender sentiment.  Just a tender.  When I get sad, I need a tender sentiment.  Reach into this and pull out a tender sentiment and read it. 
[00:37:30]  She put a mousetrap in it.  She doesn't have glasses.  It would have been perfect.  What's it say?  You are special.  Now put that back.  Here we go.  That's for sure.  Kind of makes you forget all about the glasses, doesn't it?  Exactly.  Oh, I'm not going to forget them, no.  No.  Way to be literal with humor.  Here's a piece of the eyeglass.  You could look through that little chip of glass.  See, you could get a pair of glasses just like that. 
[00:38:00]  I can't.  Well, that's the beauty of this bitch.  I thought your stylist got those for a new look.  I had a good line that no one...  I could not afford a couple hundred dollars for a new pair of glasses and a prescription.  All right.  Well, got to move on with the show.  And you're going to give me a new pair of glasses because I need glasses to see you.  If you say the word glasses again, I'm going to fucking tape them up and step on them over.  Stop. 
[00:38:30]  All the time in the world.  All right.  Well, let's find light zone.  Well, let her go.  Let her try to find her way out of the studio.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Patty.  All right.  All right, Patty.  Thank you for coming in.  Thank you.  Magoo, you've done it again.  All right.  Thank you, stalker Patty.  Oh, my God.  Someone's got to take care of that.  Oh, but she just keeps coming back.  Can somebody take her to H&M and get her a new black shirt? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Please.  Yeah.  Like a battered wife.  She just keeps...  Nice glasses.  Well, I don't want these people killing me, so...  Yeah.  Get those back to the poor thing.  He's going to get me...  We get it.  We know.  We know.  She really is like Dr. Melfi when she talks.  Let's go to John in Kentucky.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, why did you break that woman's glasses?  Because it's funny, stupid.  Now she walks out in front of the street. 
[00:39:30]  She's going to hit by a bus.  I'll give you stuff for her to laugh for tomorrow.  Big news.  Mm-hmm.  Be able to talk about it.  It would keep us...  It would keep our faces...  All right, boy.  You're doing a good job.  Glad you're back.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  All right.  Oh, she's all upset out there.  Wait, let's bring Patty back.  She's all upset.  But I need glasses to see with.  I don't wear them for show.  This is a microphone outside the studio.  No, you can talk to her out there.  Oh, Patty.  Sorry. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, we got to move on with the show, Patty.  I'm sorry.  Take care, Patty.  Be good.  All right.  Radio gold as always, baby.  Take care.  Really?  I'm just upset about the glasses.  Well, I mean...  Cake is nothing.  You can clean cake off, but I can't replace those glasses.  I don't have the money to.  But don't you work at a nice place now where you can just buy some new glasses?  I work for Starbucks, but I only make $8.75 an hour, and I have no insurance.  So how could I afford another pair of glasses? 
[00:40:30]  It can cost at least a couple hundred dollars.  So that's only like a couple of months' worth of paychecks.  That's not so bad.  I can't go without eyeglasses that long.  I mean, what about the people making minimum wage?  What are they going to do?  Well, they have other kinds of help.  What's the matter, Patty?  No.  It's a lot.  No.  Oh, she's getting upset again.  No.  I'm not going to say anything. 
[00:41:00]  She's no commenting.  I've never seen her like this.  She's getting all 60 minutes on.  Yeah, I know.  Someone better hand her glasses.  All right.  I had more cake.  I had three pieces of cake.  Give her her glasses.  Where is she?  She's right outside the door.  She's outside.  Well, your mic's not on.  Hello?  She's crying outside.  She's crying.  I'll let it happen.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Let's get some more audio of her crying, and then we'll...  Come on.  We'll do, boss. 
[00:41:30]  And then E-Rock, you do what's right.  So, Eric, you were pretty hot under the collar with no-filter Paul.  Wait, wait.  You are worse than everybody.  There's some right there.  Right there.  Oh.  Can you wipe that green goo?  This little green goo on the back because I leaned into a wall.  Yeah, that'll happen.  I'll make the next Drew Boogie remix. 
[00:42:00]  I don't know what that is.  So, what are you going to do about your glasses, Patty?  I can't do anything about them.  I don't know what to do.  I don't have money for glasses.  You really should replace them.  I think I have a 10 spot I could lend you.  See if she still likes me.  I think I have like 10 bars.  E-Rock, see if she still likes me.  No, I'm not going to be able to replace those glasses.  No, they're replaceable.  Do you still like Opie?  Like Ben Franklin's glasses in a museum.  Yeah, I love everybody. 
[00:42:30]  I could take a joke and everything, but the glasses, well, I should know he's a nut anyway.  So, you're okay?  I mean, I'm okay, but what am I going to do about my glasses?  I can't replace them.  It's a hardship.  Hardship.  That's not a hardship.  You should be thrown overboard, the hardship.  E-Rock, walk out with them on your head.  Yeah, don't bend them.  Glasses, so hard.  Interview her like that.  Yeah, interview her like that. 
[00:43:00]  You all right, Patty?  Feeling all right?  Yeah, I'm okay.  Yeah, I'm fine.  You're going to be able to go to work?  She doesn't realize.  I can work, but I'm not going to be able to see far away or recognize people from far away.  Yeah, E-Rock is interviewing Stalker Patty with her glasses.  Yeah, but I really can't go without glasses.  I need glasses.  That we're not broken.  I got 2,400 vision.  Are you still crying?  Look at me.  Are you still crying?  Look at me.  Oh, I'm all right.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  I'm fine. 
[00:43:30]  Not even noticing is looking right at them.  I say if she doesn't notice, you really break them.  Do I have green goo on my back?  Do I have goo on my back?  I don't know.  Let me see.  You look fine.  Yeah, I just got to...  I need some water.  I got to go into the bathroom and get the water.  He's going to have to lean in to give her a kiss before she's going to notice.  Please.  E-Rock is inches away from her face with the glasses on.  I just want to make sure you're okay.  Look into my eyes.  He even said look into my eyes.  I'm fine.  You're okay?  Yeah, I'm okay. 
[00:44:00]  Okay.  Oh, she should be beaten.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, she's just so beaten that she's not even noticing.  What happened, E-Rock?  A psychologist would say she's in shock right now.  She didn't even know.  Oh, she's about three inches from my face.  I had no idea that she still had her glasses.  I got what is wrong with her.  All right.  Just give her the glasses back.  Give her the goddamn glasses back.  Well, live on the air, obviously, so we can hear the joy in her voice.  Yes.  It won't be joy, though.  It'll be, oh, there they are.  Oh, good. 
[00:44:30]  Now I can see.  All right.  All right.  We'll listen to E-Rock.  Coming outside.  Some squeaky doors.  I don't know where they are.  I just can't believe I said that again.  I fucked up another one, man.  Yeah, we were obviously going to try to do something with the cake.  Her face was going to go right in the cake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all right, though.  Well, what's going on?  Bill suggested opening a window and dropping the glasses out and making her catch them. 
[00:45:00]  So if she catches them, it's okay.  Bill comes up with some pretty twisted stuff.  Where's E-Rock?  Is he waiting for her?  She might kill herself in the bathroom.  Yeah.  She's waiting outside with the glasses.  All right.  Look at that car.  You going to get one of those, Anthony?  No.  A lithium?  A lithium car.  What the hell is that?  I like iron around me.  Big vehicles.  What's going on, Danny?  A Steve car.  Sounds like a man with a gun collection. 
[00:45:30]  She's in the bathroom, so E-Rock's waiting for her to finish up.  Just walk in.  Go in there.  Broad's on this floor.  Pull your cock out and walk in that room.  Yeah, I think she has the only key, though.  There's only this one lady's room key.  Put the glasses on your ball bag.  You watch what a non-reaction this fucking dunce gives.  Oh, I thought he broke them.  I guess he was playing a trick on me.  Yes, I guess he was.  Stupid.  Yeah, relieved.  Because I wouldn't... 
[00:46:00]  And then she'll go on to say what would have happened.  Like, I would have had to get this...  And I can't afford.  What do we got, Danny?  We're just waiting?  We have to.  Yeah.  There's no girl that can drag her out of there?  Is she weeping or dropping a deuce?  Oh, no.  It's probably both at the same time.  Nothing better than a good cry in a shit.  The green girl.  You can do those simultaneously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Feels good.  Hey, this is David Duchovny.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, do we have mousetraps around?  What do you want to do to her now?  Put the glasses in a mousetrap?  No, put the glasses on the floor with a few mousetraps.  No.  Jesus.  Hey, can we get E-Rock before he gives the glasses back?  He should have had the mousetraps.  Hey, Nathaniel, do we still have mousetraps?  Too cruel.  All right.  Yeah, they're right up there by the wiffle ball up there. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Did you give them back yet?  Isn't it enough that the woman has cake on her back?  No, there's other people going in out of the ladies' room.  I can't go in.  Not enough.  She can.  Eric, dude, this would be crazy if she kills herself as you're waiting outside with her glasses.  You like Paula Abdul songs, you can use the ladies' room.  Nothing?  No, but you know what?  I'm more than willing to crash myself.  No, but I don't think it deserved to crash.  I think it was pretty funny.  You were calling him a faggot and it was kind of had to process it for a second.  Patty.  Patty.  Come here.  All right?  You all cleaned up? 
[00:47:30]  You should show them first to her.  Yeah.  Patty.  Stop crying?  Patty.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Patty, come in here.  Patty.  Watch this non-reaction.  Patty.  Oh, my God.  How are you?  She looks like someone in need of a rape kit.  No, she doesn't.  I'm fine.  You're fine?  Yeah.  We have good news for you.  What?  E-Rock has your glasses.  No, no.  Don't give it to her.  She let go.  I thought you broke them. 
[00:48:00]  I know.  Oh, my God.  Through the magic of radio, I didn't break the glasses.  What do you think of the fact that your glasses aren't broken?  It's a relief.  I can't afford to replace them.  Just not an ounce of pizzazz.  You know what it is, Jim?  She acts with her eyes.  If you really look at them, you see the excitement.  Yeah, they open up.  How many mousetraps do we have?  Oh, God.  And you can't see.  Not bad again.  And you can't see.  Well, we're going to play a little game.  We're going to have the glasses on the floor. 
[00:48:30]  Wait a minute.  We're going to play.  Are they going to have more mousetraps again?  Dad, I didn't like the way they flew.  We're going to play pick up the.  That sounds like comedy writing from Webster.  Wait a minute.  How many mousetraps do we have?  Why you.  Hey, Patty, it's a little game called pick up the glasses with your click.  Oh, God.  It's nice, actually.  The way they flew up.  It's ridiculous, isn't it, Jim?  Can I touch your hiney, Patty? 
[00:49:00]  That's all I remember is them flying.  Patty, can I touch your bottom?  Can I give it a pat?  I'll be nice.  Oh, come on.  A little one.  No, it actually looks great in those pants.  Everyone says you have a nice ass.  Turn.  I'm going to touch it.  I'm just looking.  Show Jimmy your ass.  Her ass might be fine, but from the front, she looks like she's wearing state trooper pants.  Your cheeks look great in those pants.  Like she's got motorcycle cop pants on.  Could I pat it real quick, please?  Yeah, let Jimmy pat.  I'll be a gentleman.  She has a booty. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  She's just acquired that recently.  Let me see.  I won't do it unless you tell me I can.  All right.  One little...  Wait, wait.  Let him touch your ass.  That was your one chance.  Why'd you move so fast?  Why'd you move so fast?  You didn't get a real touch.  I wasn't going to be rude.  Yeah.  I asked.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, turn around.  I'll be nice.  I promise.  Come on.  Let Jimmy touch your butt.  There's nothing sexual about a pat.  Oh, Jimmy just adjusted himself.  All right.  Why don't run away so much? 
[00:50:00]  I saw you.  You saw what?  I saw what he was doing.  What was he doing?  Yeah, it was a little pat.  Trying to join a lacrosse team.  Lacrosse, that's right.  Uh-huh.  What was I doing?  I saw you.  What?  You were touching yourself.  All right.  Do we have mousetraps?  How many we got?  Three.  We just sent some eight.  We have three.  All right, Patty.  Just keep throwing them in front of her.  Get on all fours. 
[00:50:30]  We're going to play a little game called Find the Glasses.  Yeah, you can stay close this time, please.  Yeah.  That's fair.  But one of the mousetraps will have the glasses in them.  So you've got to be very, very careful.  All right?  Sorry.  Jimmy just dove in for another feel.  Patty's cheeks are looking great.  Are you digging her ass?  Holy shit, am I?  I just want to rub my mule on it and then fucking just go ahead. 
[00:51:00]  No.  Patty, can I rub my cock on your bare ass?  Patty, how much ass did you throw?  Okay, yeah.  There's the option.  Jimmy's cock on her bare ass or mousetraps.  Yes.  Deal.  What do you want?  Or no deal.  I won't have a hard on, believe me.  What do you want to get your glasses back?  Right.  Mousetraps.  But I won't push it in, I promise you.  Pain or humiliation.  All right, I'll try to avoid the mousetraps.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Jimmy's dick on your bare ass. 
[00:51:30]  This reminds me.  It's hard.  Wait a minute.  This reminds me of when I was a boy and I told Julie that I wanted her to sit in my lap  when she was naked and she didn't want to and I said, well, there's sticker bushes here  and she chose the sticker bushes.  This is the same thing.  But only now she's choosing you.  She just chose you.  You didn't hear that?  No.  What did you say?  Yeah, you better off.  I'll do flying mousetraps.  All right, well.  I thought she was going to do the Jimmy.  The way they flew past my face like that is like a cinch.  But what about Jimmy just rubbing himself? 
[00:52:00]  No, I cannot do that.  No.  Okay, how about.  No.  Wow.  Why, Patty?  Can you see me, by the way?  You're really squinting.  I would love that if Jimmy just rammed it home.  I'm sorry.  It's how I act without my glasses.  My dick wouldn't.  So I can focus.  Yeah, that's a hell of a squinting.  So I can focus.  I'm falling out of it.  Oh, yeah.  Patty, how about this?  You just take out your bare bottom.  No.  And I kind of put my penis between the cheeks and we all go, huh?  No, I cannot. 
[00:52:30]  I will not.  I will not.  I cannot.  No.  Well, could you say it at least in a sexier tone?  This is my body.  You're just talking about it.  Could you at least think about it?  Make Jimmy feel good?  I cannot.  No.  How about a um?  I will not.  I'll do the mousetraps over that because I don't want to.  I don't want that to happen to me.  How about this, Patty?  How about this?  We're playing deal or no deal.  Oh.  Not only do we have the mousetraps on the floor and your glasses, and you've got to find  the glasses amongst the mousetraps. 
[00:53:00]  On the floor will also be one rat trap.  Oh, wow.  Those will actually take a finger off.  The rat trap will break a bone.  That will break a knuckle.  They're like miniature bear traps.  Let me show you a rat trap, even though you can't see.  This is a rat trap.  Dude, ah!  This is a rat trap.  Got teeth on it.  Oh, well.  Oh, oh.  Put a pencil.  Dude.  That is a badger trap.  Ah!  Watch.  This is-  Put a pencil in there. 
[00:53:30]  This is going to be on the ground as well.  All right?  You want this on Pal Talk?  Is it on Pal Talk?  Does it matter?  That's enough.  Ready?  Listen to this, Patty.  I can't see it.  You'll hear it.  You can't see it.  Listen.  Listen.  Oh.  Now that could hurt.  She's like-  She's like Mr. Magoo.  She can't see it.  What did you put in there?  I couldn't see it.  Well, it's a pen, but the pen is pretty much broken in half. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, Magoo, you've done it again.  So let's negotiate a little more here.  I won't have a boner.  My dick is very soft.  No, I cannot violate it.  You're not going to be violated.  How do you think I feel?  Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  Jimmy, set up what you're willing to do.  If you show your bare bottom-  I'm just not that kind of a woman.  All right, but listen to Jimmy before.  What you'll do is this.  I would never put my penis in you because you're a-  I'm not a rapist.  Can she keep her panties on? 
[00:54:30]  No, I-  No.  I don't even-  Shut your face.  Are you wearing thong?  Are you wearing a thong panty?  So like your cheek is hanging out a little?  No.  Big old lady bloomers?  Probably.  I'm logging them.  She looks like she's staring into the sun.  I know that squint.  Bill, you bring out the worst in us.  By the way, I got to tell you.  We haven't been this mean since the last time you were here.  You're full of shit.  Every time I come in here.  I have never seen a body like this. 
[00:55:00]  Her hands are on her hips and it's like your stomach is coming out and your breasts are sinking in.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  So what's the deal, Jimmy?  Once again.  Here's what I'll do.  Look, if you lean forward and you have to turn pal talk off for this.  I can't do that.  We're turning around.  I would-  I'm only packing like-  You want to feel it?  I'm only packing like four.  It's not much.  And I would just kind of gently rest it between your cheeks.  I can't do that.  I'm sorry.  Count to 30.  No, I can't do that.  You did cherry darts.  Jimmy, no.  I can't do that.  Just like a cherry.  I'm a decent person. 
[00:55:30]  I can't do that.  No, no.  Just so you know, I wouldn't put it in at all.  I'm a lady.  Let me see your hand.  I haven't been a lady.  I'm a lady.  I would put it on top of your cheeks.  Uh-uh.  Not in them.  Not between them.  I'm a lady.  I know.  Shut up.  How about 26 seconds?  All right.  Well-  You know, that's the thing.  I'm a lady.  I have a reputation for letting that be cheap or something.  The rat trap is added-  Jesus.  To the mouse traps.  Ah!  Dude, that's going to break our finger.  You can't use that.  I understand, but we, you know-  Hey, this isn't free FM. 
[00:56:00]  It's the deal we made.  It's the deal we made.  It's rat traps on XM.  It's the deal we made.  The rat trap is set.  It's up to you, Patty.  Patty.  I-  How about this?  How about-  I don't have a reputation.  Ah!  Why did you throw it-  The rat trap.  Don't put it-  Don't put it back in.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Try to be a place.  They're all around you.  Don't move.  How about this?  If she holds my hog in her hand for five seconds.  Oh my God. 
[00:56:30]  But I'm not that kind of a lady.  People have an impression of me.  That isn't true.  How about-  Can she wear a glove?  If you wear-  You can wear a glove.  Like a doctor examining his-  Right.  Yes.  You can hold my hog in your hand for five seconds with a glove on.  Here comes another rat trap.  Don't throw that, man.  Don't move, Patty.  They're all around you like grenades.  Get one of those gloves.  Show her what the gloves look like.  Yeah, let's get a glove.  Wear one of the gloves.  In the cabinet.  Right.  All right.  We're getting a glove.  And then show her a glove. 
[00:57:00]  And then you just got to kind of give him a hernia exam.  By the way, Frank from New York City-  Look at her eyes darting around the room.  Do you remember the end of Silence of the Lambs?  When she's walking through the basement?  With the night vision?  Yeah, the infrared.  That's what she looks like.  I'll start it.  Oh, no.  $20.  What?  To not only get your glasses back, you will get cold, hard cash to place Jimmy's hog in 
[00:57:30]  your left hand-  I'll match it.  That will be wearing a glove.  For five seconds.  No.  No, more than that?  Yeah.  All right, let me pee real quick.  All right.  There's another 20.  All right, the pot is up to 40.  Anybody else?  We'll accept dollar bills.  I understand that we got some people that don't have a lot of money on them right now.  Why are you looking at me?  I didn't look at you.  You can add 20?  Well, I put 20 in.  Am I going to get a reputation now?  No. 
[00:58:00]  Your reputation is already ruined.  Doctors do this.  Yeah, Jimmy's just taking a leak right now, so.  Man, you can't throw 20 in.  Huh?  What's that?  All right, I'm all in then.  No, here.  Yeah, that's all.  That's all you need to do.  A couple singles.  It's up to $42, Patty.  It's either that or the rat traps and the mouse traps that are on the floor.  And they're set.  Don't even move.  They're all around you right now.  Don't look around.  Trust me.  Don't look down.  Ah!  One just went off.  Don't move.  All I remember is the breeze going by my face when those mousetraps went off last time. 
[00:58:30]  That'll never be erased from my mind.  Well, you won't have to live through it if you, um...  Oh, Jesus.  Did Danny just get nailed with the rat trap?  Yeah.  He might have broke his thumb.  And I'm not even kidding.  I didn't think it was set, but I just touched it.  Keith's in for $10.  From Bam.  Oh, from Bam.  General Bam.  Even Bill, who makes no money, threw a couple bucks.  A lot of cash in there now. 
[00:59:00]  And Bill Burr's in for $0.75.  Thank you, Bill.  No, no, no.  I only got the $100 off.  He threw like $9.  All right, accepted.  $10.  All right.  Jimmy just...  Just priming it up.  These people look awful, though.  All these guys in the room.  We'll take the...  Don't do that, dude.  That's going to hit someone's foot and break their foot.  Yeah, be careful.  Jimmy doesn't want the pal talk.  Absolutely.  No, no.  You can't aim it up anywhere.  It's got to be above.  It has to.  How about those DC cameras?  All right, yeah.  Cover those DC cameras up. 
[00:59:30]  We don't know what's going on in here.  Yeah.  You don't have...  Only one glove, Patty.  I don't have...  One glove.  Come on.  There's nothing wrong with me.  This is a black earl.  She's putting two...  She's putting two gloves on.  So how long does she have to hold it for?  Should we check with Elo to make sure?  Timer.  I don't want you to get screwed over this.  Me neither.  Quickly.  Quickly.  Be responsible.  All right.  We're going to be responsible for once. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  We want to keep our jobs.  All right.  Someone set up the deal or no deal.  All right.  Here it is, Patty.  We have your glasses and roughly, I don't know, 50 some odd dollars there.  20, 40, 60, 65, at least 70 yen.  All right.  70 bucks or so over there.  And your glasses, they are up for grabs.  You either have to crawl around on the floor with rat traps and mouse traps and find your glasses. 
[01:00:30]  It could be very hurtful.  You could get injured.  Or your other option with your gloved hand, your latex gloved hand, like any doctor would do, any professional would do.  Let me read that.  You would then grab Jimmy's mule and hold it for a set amount of time.  Can we do this?  We haven't determined yet.  Can we do this bit?  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Hope he is on the phone now with Elo.  Oh, this is always awkward to explain something to your boss.  Checking it out.  Well, Elo, this is what we want to do.  Stark and Patty is wearing a glove on our left hand.  Latex glove.  Latex glove.  She wants to get her glasses back.  We have some cash that we're going to give after the bit just because we're nice guys.  And Jimmy is just going to place something in her left hand for 30 seconds. 
[01:01:30]  In her gloved hand.  In her gloved hand.  Something in her hand.  All right.  Right.  All right.  Look, it's his pocket.  What do you think?  He's still explaining.  All right.  So we don't know what's going to be in Patty's hand, right, Elo? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  We have no idea what's in Patty's hand.  I don't know.  Something tells me I don't need to talk during this bit.  Why don't we paper up that window.  All right, Elo, how's everything else?  Can we just throw out the people that are in there?  All right, bye.  That we don't know.  All right.  No.  Anyone we don't know has to leave that room.  Everyone else can stay.  What kind of stand-up guy am I?  I'm not even going to look, so I can't testify. 
[01:02:30]  Come on, I want you to look.  I'm priming it for you.  You're smart.  I watched the Untouchables last night.  Here we go.  See?  First of all, officially, this is just something that it's alone just for a goof.  No, no, no.  Watch this.  Watch what I do now.  Patty, it's not enough to get glasses, but I, Anthony, Bill Burr, and the rest of the  gang, including little Jimmy Norton, for your troubles today, want you to have this. 
[01:03:00]  Wow.  What a loophole you found.  There you go.  Yeah, that'll hold up in court.  Well, the judge will say, oh, you worded it right.  Got us.  Darn it.  I love whenever we try to be legal eagles.  Oh, technically.  The cop doesn't have his headlights on.  He can't take it to you.  Good point.  Jimmy, you're not going to feel any sexual gratification from this, correct?  It's an impossibility.  There you go.  Perfect. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Patty.  Patty.  You want your glasses back, right?  Yeah.  I hold in my hand glasses.  She's going to hold in her hand something that resembles a pimple.  Come here.  Come over here.  Come over here.  I don't have to look.  Shut up, would you?  Put your hand down.  Jesus.  Here he goes.  Now wrap your hand around it.  Wrap your hand around it.  Wrap your hand around it.  You got to hold it.  Hold it.  Wrap your hand. 
[01:04:00]  Well.  Two.  Wrap tighter.  Wrap your hand tighter.  You can't just hold the helmet, you goose.  I've never done this before in my life.  Me neither with a non-human.  Patty.  Close the freaking door.  Patty, wrap your hand tighter.  Yeah, well.  I've never done it before.  Now pretend you're starting a lawnmower.  Oh, my God.  How is it, Jim? 
[01:04:30]  How is it?  Your exam did more for you than this would do for me.  All right, Patty.  Oh, my God.  What do you think?  I don't like the fact that she's only cup.  Just give it one good one.  Is she weeping or laughing?  Laughing.  I don't know what to say.  Just like.  Oh, I'm going to hear it from the people on Palpock tonight.  Just go left and right a little bit.  All right.  Give a little tug.  All right, Patty.  Oh, she gave it a tug.  I have never done anything like that.  Well, we don't even know what you did. 
[01:05:00]  Here you go.  Here's your glasses.  She never did in her whole life.  Now throw those away.  Yeah, I have to.  I didn't slide out.  I think Patty has no idea what she was doing because she didn't have her glasses on.  There she goes.  Oh, I don't have to squint anymore.  That was really bad.  All right, Patty.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Did Dummy almost open the door?  Ben.  Ben came in.  Ben was very interested in what was going on.  Oh, okay.  Ben.  All right, Patty.  I'm so embarrassed.  Me too. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  No, that was fun.  Wow.  I'm sure it was.  This whole show needs a shower now.  I am disgusted.  I thought it was very sanitary.  Yeah.  It was done very sanitary.  Jim was well shaven.  Oh, you noticed?  Thank you, Bill.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  It'll be an experience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, an experience.  Brings me back to the first time I met you in the studio or something.  Oh, what happened there?  Me and you?  Yeah, he opened his fly for 30 seconds. 
[01:06:00]  Fly.  Fly.  Fly.  No, I touched you.  I was the first man to ever touch your breasts.  Right.  I touched your nipples.  Oh, that's what it was.  Then they made you get up and, you know, unzip you and do that.  I got to take my headphones off halfway.  Huh?  I got to take my headphones off halfway when she's talking.  I know.  Your voice is really annoying, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Thank you for stopping by.  Stopping her voice is a contraceptive.  For Anthony's birthday.  And we really appreciate everything you do for the show.  That was wonderful. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Have fun at work.  Congratulations on the new gig.  Thank you.  All right.  There she goes.  Stalker Patty.  All right.  I'm going to get her.  What happened, Patty?  What happened?  Wait, Patty, Patty.  What happened?  There you go.  Go to your job, you filthy whore.  There she goes.  That's right.  Give Hooker the money.  Slut.  No, we're keeping the money.  We should.  For legal reasons.  That's right.  Hey, this is adult film star Mary Carey,  and you're listening to the worst of O.B. and Anthony. 
[01:07:00]  O.B. and Anthony.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let the show die, then.  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony show.  They should be shot.  So I got to ask.  I still don't know the story.  I really don't.  Twitchell is one of our guys.  He's done a lot of great radio for us.  He was crying at the O.A. traveling virus.  He was supposed to be in the petting zoo.  And what the hell happened? 
[01:07:30]  I really don't know.  There was a huge dilemma with him.  I don't know.  He, look, nice enough guy, but he doesn't seem to be very stable.  You know, I think we saw that a few times in the studio.  And with him being thrown under the bus so much, some people can take it.  Some people can't.  And I think he just snapped.  You know what?  Too bad.  All right.  When I first started coming on this show, I spent a night in jail. 
[01:08:00]  I did some awful things.  You should have seen where Montana Gunn dropped an ice cube from,  and I threw it in my mouth.  Yes.  I did some awful things on this show, and I had fun, and I lived under the bus.  I lived under it.  You've got to understand your role on this show.  You know, Twitchells is on this show because he's a comic with Tourette's  that can't help himself, and he does really stupid things,  like slap his face, like jump when you say jump, and the noises he makes. 
[01:08:30]  That's the reason he's on the show.  I don't really care about his comedy.  He might be a terrific comedian.  He might.  I don't know.  I've never seen his comedy, so I can't even comment.  I don't care, though.  He's on the show for all the other stuff he does.  But I think he's confused, and he's starting to think that he needs a little  respect on the show now.  Yeah.  And there's been people in our past that thought the same way,  and we kicked them out the door because we didn't care about them on that level. 
[01:09:00]  Some have been kicked out.  Some have retired.  Yeah, whatever.  Walked away.  Whatever, because you get confused.  You start getting a little popularity, so you're like, all right,  now that I'm popular, now they'll let me be a comedian on their show.  Now I want to change my character.  No.  Well, you don't get to.  It's not to knock Twitchels.  I don't know what you do on stage.  Like you said, it might be really funny.  I don't know.  But you're in the game not that long, and you're really more well-known  than you should be.  No reflection on your talent, considering how long you've been in the game. 
[01:09:30]  Like, you've been doing comedy only a few years, and if you would have walked  on the stage in Worcester, almost all 6,000 of them would have known who you are.  Yeah.  And they would have all yelled, jump, jump, jump.  Yeah, exactly.  All knowing what gets you.  You wouldn't have gotten one joke out.  Yeah.  All right, you know what?  We'll throw him up on stage at the PNC.  If that's what he wants, we'll do that.  Oh, boy.  If that's what he wants, I will prove my point, that not only we don't give a crap 
[01:10:00]  about his comedy, our fans don't.  So I say this to Twitchels today.  That's a great invitation.  I say this to Twitchels.  You want time on that stage with all these great comedians?  You got it, pal.  You got it.  Buster.  You opened the show.  Mm-hmm.  He might even be a good stand-up.  Well, let's see.  Twitchels, call the show right now.  I got an invite for you.  I got an invite for you.  Mm-hmm.  Can we call him in case he's not listening?  Yeah.  I think they're working on it.  So that's the setup.  Twitchels was supposed to be in the petting zoo. 
[01:10:30]  Supposed to be in the petting zoo with a bunch of other people.  And I think it bothers him that we wanted him for that and not for the stage.  Yeah, I think that is the gist of the whole thing.  The genesis of the whole thing.  He didn't want to say it like that.  He didn't want to put it like that.  So he kind of turned it into a security issue.  Kenny, is that what I'm getting?  Well, I think the reality of the whole situation hit him and he got anxious.  Yeah.  Because I had two or three lovely conversations with Twitchels to set this thing up. 
[01:11:00]  And by lovely, you mean completely annoying.  No, no.  He was very enthusiastic, upbeat, you know, couldn't volunteer quick enough to do the petting zoo.  You know, agreed, you know, knew what he was getting into.  Yeah.  Right.  I hooked him up with Pat Fuminaki.  They drive up together.  What a pair.  Wow.  What a connection you made there.  Yeah.  They share a hotel room together.  Ooh, sexy. 
[01:11:30]  You know, confirmed everything.  Like I said, I spoke to him two or three times.  He didn't mention one negative thing about anything.  But at the day of the show, right before showtime, I think he got a little anxious and maybe had a panic attack.  You think?  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden, people are coming up to me like, Twitchels needs protection.  Twitchels needs a laminate and not a VIP wristband.  Twitchels this, Twitchels that.  But, and then, and then I finally, Twitchels gets to me after, you know, a few people come up to me and Twitchels is like, he's worried about people punching him in the petting zoo because he's done these kind of events before. 
[01:12:00]  He's done a petting zoo before?  No one has done a petting zoo.  Yeah.  And who's going to punch him?  Before with humans.  Yeah.  And he, you know, he needs, and I'm telling, I'm telling like everything's going to be fine.  You know, you don't have to worry about nothing.  But no, I'm telling you because I've done these type of things before, you know, I know.  Oh boy. 
[01:12:30]  So I go, Twitchels, look, not for nothing.  You know, I didn't say nothing like, who do you think you are or anything like that?  You know, I know maybe I'm not as diplomatic as I should be sometimes.  Way to phrase it.  Like I'm a little rough around the edges.  Yeah.  I take the gold out of their teeth and separate their belongings.  Yeah.  But I said, I said, Twitchels, like, not for nothing.  You know, you're in the village in a petting zoo.  Let's put this in perspective.  Right.  You gave it a little perspective.  And that's when he really, like, lost it.  He said, this is showbiz.  Yeah.  I said, you're not on the main stage. 
[01:13:00]  I says, when the Short Bus Comedy Tour can sell out this arena, then I'll be your road manager.  Now, I'm hearing things because he said something like, Kenny came up to him and said, who the F do you think you are?  Yeah, that's not true.  Look, the guy's got enough problems.  Like, I would never, you know, like I said, I know I'm not, like, the most diplomatic guy, but I was quoted as saying that, and that's a total fallacy. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  He's certainly not the most diplomatic guy.  I remember when I was touring with Dice years ago, and we were in Florida, and I hadn't met Kenny's family or Andrew's family.  And we were going to be in Vegas together.  So, Kenny, just to make sure, takes me to Room Alone and goes, you wouldn't hurt a child, would you?  I'm like, what?  And Jimmy pointed out when he told me this on the way home from Boston.  Like, if I was going to hurt a child, would I actually admit that to you?  That's why.  That's why I'm doing this.  Only to get access. 
[01:14:00]  Why would you ask him that?  No, Andrew had small children.  I had small children.  We just met Jimmy.  No, you know he for, like, six months.  Oh, my God.  I went to Dice with that one.  What a set.  What's wrong with this guy?  Why would he ask me that?  He goes, ah, it's wrong.  He shouldn't have said that to you.  Yeah.  It was all hurt.  All right.  So, let's get into it.  You know, let's speed this along here.  This isn't the first time, like, I've had a little run-in with Twitchells, all right?  The first time was we went to Bill's Bar in Boston for opening day, and we had the velvet rope set up for the VIP area. 
[01:14:30]  And every time I turned around, Twitchells was inviting people and bringing his entourage into the VIP area.  Got an entourage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, so, like, I tell him once nicely.  You know, I give him the benefit of the doubt.  The second time, I just throw him out.  All right, so the petting zoo, he had a problem.  He didn't want to be in the petting zoo or whatever?  Well, no, he just, I said, Twitchells, look, it's plain and simple.  If you feel uncomfortable, we're not going to force you to do something you don't want to do.  So, where did it escalate to him crying and hating you? 
[01:15:00]  Well, I just told him, look, if you don't want to be here, you don't have to be here, all right?  And then, you know, he snapped at me.  He's like, I don't need to be spoken to like that by you.  And I'm like, fine.  You know, you don't want to be here.  You can leave.  He did mention that, you know, he was on Leno and you haven't been.  Well, he didn't say that.  That's true.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Oh, yeah, he did.  What did he do on Leno?  He goes, when Kenny can say he was on Leno.  He did like a stupid human trick.  What did he do? 
[01:15:30]  He had like a wiffle ball bat in his fat because he lost a lot of weight.  And he hit a wiffle ball with the wiffle ball bat that was like attached to his gut.  When did he do that?  Years ago.  I would love to see that.  Why would you mention that?  I don't know.  Another reason why you should not be on the main stage, by the way, unless you want to  do that trick.  I think 6,000 people would like to see you reenact that trick you did on Leno.  Can we get Louis Twitchell Santani on the phone?  Yeah, we're trying to get him on the phone.  I hope so.  So he ran off? 
[01:16:00]  Well, no.  I told him, look, we're not going to make you do anything you don't want to do if you're  too uncomfortable.  Right.  We heard that three times, Kenny.  And then he goes, I'll think about it.  I was like, okay.  And I, you know, I left because I had like a lot of running around to do.  And then the next thing, when I went to pick up Anthony, Anthony filled me in on the next  part of the story.  Okay.  That's what happened.  Thank you, Anthony.  So Anthony's at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in the lobby.  Well, Kenny told him he doesn't need to be if he doesn't want to be.  Oh, Kenny's the worst.  You should see the itineraries. 
[01:16:30]  This is what it says.  Ken picks up Jim.  Thanks.  Take to airport, park car.  Kenny starts car.  Put in park.  Open door.  Lock door for safety.  All right.  Kenny comes.  Right foot.  Left foot.  Right foot.  Kenny kisses his family goodbye.  It's all written down for him.  He refers to himself in the third person.  It's me and him.  Instead of saying, pick up eight.  Ken picks up Jim.  Like it's a little more casual.  So it's Ken picks up Jim. 
[01:17:00]  Does he?  Kenny's terrific, but he's got some things going on that you notice when you hang out with him more and more.  Like when we were driving to Boston and back from Boston, he has these directions in.  Yeah.  And he has his left thumb on the directions for the next turn that he needs to make.  And he refuses to let go of the paper until he makes that turn, the next part of the direction.  Then he can slide the thumb down.  And then he slides the thumb down.  And I'm like, let me just look at the paper.  I'll tell you where to go. 
[01:17:30]  No, no, no, no.  He gets all freaked out.  He has this system in his head.  Noah didn't hold the arc directions as carefully as you hold.  And I said to him, all right, we have to go to one exit.  Like exit 11.  I'm like exit 27.  Why are you still holding that?  Every exit, he'll glance down.  Oh, my God.  You are a kook.  Just in case it's changed.  I'm very organized.  That's organization.  Yeah.  Healthy.  Where you go with it is just a lifetime of self-hatred and compartmentalizing.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:18:00]  We're going to take a break.  And then we'll continue with the Twitchell's crying story.  Because Anthony.  I had a run in.  Anthony was just in the lobby of the hotel.  Just wanted to leave to go to the venue.  That's all he wanted.  And he runs into a hysterical, crying Twitchell's.  And then Twitchell spent the whole night in his room like naked or something in a bed because  there's a creepy picture of him instead of being at the venue with us.  And he made $35 worth of phone calls from the room.  All right.  We'll get into all that next.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America. 
[01:18:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, it is.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  So you're in the lobby of the hotel getting ready for the O&A traveling virus.  Of course, we got to set up Twitchell's now kind of running through the lobby.  Well, no, he was.  I was walking out.  He was walking in toward the elevators.  We meet in the hallway and he's his eyes are all red.  And he's starting to like starting to cry. 
[01:19:00]  And he's telling me now conveying the story of Kenny.  But it includes things like Kenny saying, who the F do you think you are?  You know, you're not one of the comics and just really degrading him.  And as he's saying it, dude, he's completely breaking down.  It's like, and Kenny tells me if I can't do, you know, I got things to do.  And just loses it in a way where blubbering is really the only way to convey it. 
[01:19:30]  Was he doing his Tourette's as he was crying?  Yeah, yeah, like not the noises, but the like, or his neck muscles that really get tight and his head would go one way.  But completely weeping about this whole thing.  That is the worst.  To where I had a prize in front of him.  And I'm now standing there.  I'm like, what the hell do you, what am I, why am I dealing with this?  Did you hug him?  No. 
[01:20:00]  Are you crazy?  I am an insensitive ass.  I care about me and my girlfriend and certain family members.  Period.  Thanks, Sam.  That's it.  That makes me feel really good today.  Thanks.  Yeah, me too.  Jeez, okay, a little care for Opie.  Jesus.  I dropped a tear once in a minute.  I care about you.  I care about your health.  I care about us as a radio show.  Can I be a selfish bastard?  Remember that time I cried? 
[01:20:30]  I dropped a tear and you wiped it away with the crook of your finger?  Yes, I just took my pointer finger knuckle and wiped the tear from your eye.  And then I held your chin between my thumb and forefinger.  That's right.  And you spit in my mouth.  And I realized you didn't have one.  Yeah.  You tried to hold my chin and your fingers met.  Touched.  Just a little acknowledgement that I'm alive would be nice.  I don't want you to be asking how I am every day, but jeez.  All right.  Holy crap.  I don't care.  So he's crying.  You don't want to deal with it. 
[01:21:00]  No, I don't want to deal with him.  Right.  I do not want to deal with any crying going on.  We got a show to do.  Like, I'm thinking in my head things, you know, we're busy.  And now I got this crisis on my hands.  I can't just walk away from it.  I don't know why.  I should have.  But I didn't.  And I told him, I said, look, here's what you do.  Go up to your room and calm the F down.  Relax.  Rent a movie.  Get something to eat and lay down and relax. 
[01:21:30]  That was Anthony's advice because that means you were done with him.  That's, yeah, that's pretty much.  It was either that.  Go to your room.  Or talk to him for another half hour.  Yeah.  In the lobby as he's crying.  And I'm going, I wanted to get to the venue and check things out and see things.  And blubbering crying.  And that's how I left him.  He went back.  And then he's apologizing and thanking.  And, you know, I'm so sorry to be like this in front of you.  I don't want to be like this in front of you. 
[01:22:00]  Ew.  Like, oh, God.  He's unstable.  And the picture they took, I guess No Filter Paul took the picture.  I'm not sure.  Apparently.  I can't look at it.  It's frightening.  But it's on all the websites.  We should get it up on opandanthony.com.  But it's Twitchells with man boobs because he's like, has no clothes on, I guess.  And he's in his bed.  Used to be fat.  Just kind of staring at the camera like Private Pyle from Full Metal Jacket.  He looks very unstable.  And that's the shot they got of him in the hotel instead of him being at the venue for the O&A Traveling Virus. 
[01:22:30]  Gunnery Sergeant Kenny is going to get shot.  We paid his way and he did nothing, right?  Um, wow, really?  Is that what happened?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Okay, so he got a hotel room.  Well, half one.  He shared it with Pat.  Hotel room.  And he made, he put $35 worth of phone calls on my tab.  And that's that, right?  That's the end of the story?  A babbling twitcher?  Yeah, he ended up not showing up.  He didn't even go down there to watch the show. 
[01:23:00]  I know what's great?  We were talking about this on the way home from Boston, too.  He drove with Pat from Menachie.  So, you know, that was a very long ride for Pat from Menachie.  And Pat doesn't want to show any emotion ever.  Oh, no.  Of course not.  That's why he eats a lot and has his, well, he doesn't want to get into anything serious.  So, we were just imagining how awful that conversation was all the way back to Jersey.  Because, you know, Twitch is opening his heart, you know, saying some things.  And Pat's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If Pat wanted to show any kind of emotion, he would talk about the fact that his father lives maybe a mile away from him. 
[01:23:30]  That's what I'm saying.  And he hasn't seen him in years, you know?  That's what I'm saying.  Pat has his own problems and doesn't want to dig into it whatsoever.  So, he doesn't want, you know, a blubbering, crying Tourette's comic, you know,  sharing emotional times with him.  Wouldn't you love to just see Pat lose it like that?  More than anything.  Just like get off on the guy and go, hey, you know, but still in the Pat kind of way.  Right.  You know, like, hey, Twitchels, you know, why don't you go f*** yourself because I got my own f*** problems. 
[01:24:00]  We got him on the line.  Pat.  Hey, guys.  See, listen to the clown on the outside.  Exactly.  Now, Pat, you had to drive with Twitchels.  Yes, I did.  And share a room with him?  Yeah.  I think next time at PNC, with all due respect to Twitchels or Big A, I think I'll pay for my own single room. 
[01:24:30]  Wow.  I need solitude.  Yeah.  You've got to get into character.  Wait, was he loud when he was sleeping?  Uh, no, it was like, uh, he was on the Twitchels reality show where you overact and he was singing in the shower and it was crazy.  Twitchels reality show.  What do you mean he was overacting?  Overacting.  Well, first, when we got to the room, Paul and Denise were there and they must be the three loudest people on the planet.  Mm-hmm.  People were complaining within five minutes about the noise. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, they are very loud.  Excited or excited.  Yep.  Just happy to be there.  So he was overacting?  Was he, what was he, just happy to be there?  Is that what it was?  Uh, yeah, it was like a sort of a manic thing going on.  Oh, and he let me know that he's used to, uh, rooming with comedians, so he might be naked at some point.  How's that, Paul?  Holy Jesus, hold the phone.  Are you kidding me?  He blames that on rooming with comedians?  Yeah, that's what it is. 
[01:25:30]  We don't do that around each other.  No.  Although me and Levy did one time soil a television set.  Doing a shower on video, but.  So, so wait, he said he might be naked and he was singing in the shower?  Uh, yeah, well, he pretty much kept to himself in the shower.  I, I kind of let him know there's towels in the bathroom and you can use them.  So was he naked?  Uh, no, I didn't see anything.  And if he was naked, I kind of averted my eyes. 
[01:26:00]  Pat, let's be honest.  You were scared to fall asleep with him in the room with you, right?  Yeah, Paul kind of suggested some things that I might be nervous about.  Did you just lay there and go?  Wait, what did Paul suggest?  I, well, Paul, those British people always use the word fag, so.  Yeah.  Maybe he's talking about smoking.  I don't know.  Hey, so how was the write-up?  Was it pleasant at least and fun and like looking forward to the event? 
[01:26:30]  Well, I just cracked my stereo and drove fast, so.  Pat didn't want to deal with him.  See, anything?  No, it's not even that.  You're missing it.  He doesn't want to deal with anything serious ever.  That's correct.  So on the way up, you guys didn't talk all that much.  Yeah, just every once in a while in my peripheral vision, I'd catch a little twitch going on.  Yeah.  You know those long road trips.  You open up a little bit to the people in the car.  You can't help it.  You know, but Pat doesn't want to do any of that. 
[01:27:00]  No, it's all about fun and laughter with Pat.  That's right.  Avoid him leaving.  He's never going to say, listen to the words and what they mean in this song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Unless it's Bobby McFerrin.  When?  So what happened, when did you realize there was a problem?  Well, I was standing right there when Kenny had his little talk.  I'm doing the quotes with my fingers.  Talk with Twitchell.  He never said, who do you think you are? 
[01:27:30]  He just explained that he is not for the big stage.  He's for the petting zoo.  Kenny's very professional, and he'll tell you what you don't want to hear at times.  Yeah, he's not going to sit there wasting time beating around the bush.  No.  He'll tell you what it is, and that's it.  So what happened in the room?  What happened on the way home?  Wait, did Twitchell want the big stage, Pat?  You know, he never expressly said that, but he kept saying stuff like, I've been in show 
[01:28:00]  business since I was seven, he was just at a, he had an extra part in a movie the night  before, and he was up all night the night before, because he called me at 12.30 a.m.,  and then again at 2.30 a.m. when I was trying to get some sleep for the long ride I had the  next day.  He's been in show business since seven, but you know what?  Twitchell's is all about twitching, slapping his face, and jumping when we say jump.  Yeah, I said that.  He's never been bigger because of that.  That's why you're on the show, but you're not on the show for being a comedian, you're  there for... 
[01:28:30]  Right, exactly, and he has to realize that, or his days on the Opie and Anthony show are  done.  Yeah, and it's not, again, a knock on his thing, but if you got that going and you're  billing yourself as a comic with Tourette's, then don't be mad when we exploit it when you  bill yourself as that.  Right.  That's what got you in the door.  There's a million, and again, there's a lot of good comedians, man, not a million, but  there's a lot of good ones that could be you're doing funny stuff.  You gotta keep in mind, he's not even 21 yet.  Yeah, he's young, I mean, I understand.  And he smoked a little 420 just before the show. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, that's what he was telling me, too, in the hallway as he was weeping.  He goes, I just need some pot, I just need some pot, and then I just heard that he had  been smoking the whole time.  I think he got anxious, he got a panic attack, he got anxiety.  Yeah, I think that was it.  So you saw the talking to, was Twitchell's being a little unreasonable?  Excuse me?  You saw Kenny's talking to his Twitchell's, was Twitchell's being a little bit unreasonable?  A little bit.  Well, I saw him asking Paul about the, because we just had the blue wristbands, and he was 
[01:29:30]  saying, nope, I heard we get the VIP tags.  And then I wasn't sure if he asked Kenny about that.  Right, right.  But it probably got back to Kenny about that.  And then he had some weird concern about somebody beating him up in the petting zoo.  I said, I was a bouncer, there's a production manager that was supposed to...  No one was going to beat anybody up in the petting zoo.  No, he's unstable.  So how was the ride home there, Pat? 
[01:30:00]  The long ride home.  I made the music a little louder, drove a little faster.  Was he trying to get into conversation with you about it?  No, he just said, I think I need a break from the show.  Well, he's got it.  We don't care.  Yeah, I told him I didn't think that was going to be a problem at that point.  There's people waiting in the wings to take his place.  Who cares?  Yeah.  So.  All right.  How was he that night in the room when you got back?  Uh, it was completely dark when I got in. 
[01:30:30]  The lights were completely out and he was under the sheets and...  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah.  Rented some porno and just...  Was he awake?  Charged it to the room?  Uh, no.  It was a jeep, jeep, jeep, twitch.  All right.  You ever see the movie, Casualties of War?  No, but I'd love to talk to you about it sometime once I do.  When the new guy's running along the road asking a bunch of stupid questions and he  ends up stepping on a landmine. 
[01:31:00]  That's like every war movie, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  What did you say when he said, I may need a break from the show for a while?  I said, that might be a good idea.  Daddy.  Daddy.  See, Pat is all about fun until he pulls up, gets into that trailer by the airport,  and that door shuts.  Then, when he's alone with himself...  My animal's in a big bowl of some kind of food. 
[01:31:30]  When he's alone with his thoughts, it's not good.  Do you have roaches, Pat?  Do I have what?  Bugs?  No.  Okay.  No.  All right, Pat.  Bye.  The cats keep them away.  You had a good time, though, with the O&A Traveling Virus?  Oh, yeah.  But before the petting zoo, I was out in front by the dunking clown.  Yeah.  Hack-O the clown.  Hack-O the clown.  He goes, hey, fat guy in the black shirt.  And about two of us fat guys in black shirts were looking at each other going, 
[01:32:00]  who does he mean?  Yeah, which guy does he mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, more rolls than a bakery.  You would have narrowed them down to 100.  Ah.  Ah.  More rolls than a bakery.  Ha-ha.  Ha.  Oh.  23 skidoo.  That line was a lot funnier when you posted it on the message board and said it was 100  guys in black shirts wondering which guy he was talking to.  Yeah, why'd you say two?  Damn, I got to work on my number.  Takes away from the whole joke.  All right, Pat.  Thank you.  All right.  All right. 
[01:32:30]  So for another gentleman.  Steve S. from Bayshore says, Twitchells, what does he think he is?  Julius Seizure?  Oh, okay.  This is Big A.  Oh, sorry.  Oh.  This is Big A.  You're listening to the worst of Opie Nantyny.  Who, uh, now, now, now, now, now, stop staring at me and, oh, the rest of Opie Nantyny. 
[01:33:00]  You're listening to the worst.  Worst.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss and you're listening to the worst of Opie Nantyny.  This is the fucking worst of Opie Nantyny.  That's pretty stupid.  Ladies and gentlemen, Twitchells. 
[01:33:30]  Twitchells.  Yo.  What's up?  There he is.  Who's this?  It's, uh, Opie Nantyny.  Oh, they put me through it all tonight, guys.  What's up?  I just woke up.  Well, we think you're unstable.  Yeah.  More unstable than most of us.  You and me both, man.  Like, you were crying at the ONA traveling virus?  What is going on with you?  Yeah, yeah, man.  You, you, you.  I woke up the next morning feeling like a complete ass. 
[01:34:00]  And, uh, I think it was, uh, pretty fair to say that.  What was the main issue?  Uh, well, first of all, just to start the scene, I've been, I've been going through a lot of, a lot of shit.  A lot of people want me to go back on medicine, and I don't want to do it.  And, uh, I, I, the one thing is, I've always been nervous about being around, like, a lot of, a lot of people, like, like, like, like, in those times.  I didn't know what the Pennington thing was going to be like, and I worked in a show before where I was in a thing like that where the people were passing by, like, audience interactive, and I'd been punched before. 
[01:34:30]  And I just, I know I was acting like a baby, but I just get really overprotective.  And I really politely brought it up to, uh, to Kenny and, uh, who would want to punch you?  He was just so busy.  He was so busy and so stressed, and he had so much stuff going on.  You know, you know, Twitchels, you don't stand still long enough for anyone to be able to punch you.  Yeah, really.  They'd have to be good.  I know, I know that.  Absolutely.  And I, I definitely, definitely didn't, didn't understand the whole concept, and I, I took it, you know, uh, the wrong way. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, Twitchels, Twitchels, Twitchels.  I definitely didn't complain or anything.  Twitchels, when, when were you at an event where you got punched?  Uh, I was at a show called Nightmares Extreme Screen Park at the Wachovia Spectrum.  It was a show that ran for, uh, two years.  It was actually coming back to the spectrum in Philadelphia.  And what, but what happened?  Like, what?  I was supposed to, I'm on stage doing my thing.  I, I was the host of the show, and I jump off stage, and I, like, you know, go around the people and basically kind of like, you know, 
[01:35:30]  walk, try to scare the people.  And I scared this one guy, and he pumps me for scaring him.  And he got escorted out.  Now, isn't that different?  Yeah, so much different.  Isn't that different than just the, the petting zoo thing?  You know, where, where it's like, you, you, you, you really need, uh, to be concerned about your safety.  What we're hearing is, you're more concerned about maybe getting a laminate instead of the wristband, 
[01:36:00]  and that you weren't being treated, um, like you felt.  Oh, absolutely not.  That's not, that's not the case with, uh, at all, whatsoever.  I was, I was definitely, I'm definitely, first of all, I'm definitely content at what I'm doing.  That's not, that's not the, the problem at all.  A lot of people were asking me about why wasn't I on the stage.  And to be honest, as a comedian, I didn't think I'm ready to be even, you know, on a show with the caliber of comics that are up there.  It had nothing to do with that at all.  I just get nervous when, you know, it was my first time doing something where, you know, like where it would, I didn't know what that was going to be like, 
[01:36:30]  and I just got nervous.  So, you know, and I, I wasn't complaining at all.  I didn't make it, I didn't make it seem, I didn't make it, you know, I didn't seem, you know, even try to come off like that way at all.  It was very nice.  Was Kenny nice to you?  I never, I never complained.  Was Kenny nice to you?  I'm not a serious person.  All right, Twitchels, you got to listen a little bit.  You're just babbling.  Was Kenny nice to you?  Was Kenny nice to you?  Absolutely not.  No, not at all.  I don't think he knows that word. 
[01:37:00]  What happened?  Now, because we're hearing stories, like I heard from you actually that he said, who the fuck do you think you are?  Absolutely.  I wrote down exactly what he said so I wouldn't forget.  Oh, okay.  What, what, what is it?  Give us the Kenny quote.  He said, Twitchels, I need to talk to you.  This is in front of Pat from Monarchi, who is in front of a couple other people from the...  All right, get Pat on the phone.  I forget who it was.  All right, Twitchels, Twitchels, hold on, hold on, hold on.  This was after you told Kenny your concerns about being in front of a lot of people 
[01:37:30]  and you were worried about your safety, right?  The way I worded it was I didn't know if security was going to be in that area at all  because I didn't see anyone, so I politely asked.  That's all I did.  And I want to hear what Kenny said.  Yeah, what did Kenny say?  What did Kenny say to you?  All right, guys.  I'm looking at it right now.  He said to me exactly, who the fuck do you think you are?  First, he said, Twitch will let me talk to you.  He says, who do you think you are?  He says, who the fuck do you think you are?  And he says, we do not need you. 
[01:38:00]  We do not need you.  That's why you're not on the big stage.  And that's why you're in the petting zoo.  You're a nobody.  And whether or not all of that is true, I mean, I'm man enough to admit that, you know,  all the shit I go through, I'm an emotional person.  And I just took it.  Maybe he was fucking with me, but I took it the wrong way.  And I figured, if I'm going to break down, I'd rather do it at the hotel than there.  I've got stuff in my life.  And that's just, I'm honest.  I'm man enough to admit that. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  Kenny.  Next up.  Twitchell, shut up for a second.  Come up so to Kenny.  Yeah.  Is that what you said to Twitchells?  Absolutely not.  And I believe Pat Fuminaki already backed me up by saying, I didn't say, who the hell do you think you are?  No, it was, who the fuck do you think you are?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I didn't speak to him that way.  You know, and, you know, Twitchells has his demented perception.  I'm not going to debate the issue with him.  I already said my piece.  Pat backed me up.  All right.  And the thing is, is that I think it's reasonable to conclude. 
[01:39:00]  He said he got nervous, that he had anxiety and had a panic attack and freaked out.  And like I also said, this isn't the first encounter I had with Twitchells and his big inflated ego.  All right.  At Bill's bar in Boston, he was bringing people into the VIP area and I asked him not to do it.  And he continued to do it.  So I drew him out of there.  And it was one of the reasons.  It's another example of why you are such a fucking liar. 
[01:39:30]  And you know it, you douchebag.  You fucking piece of shit ass wipe.  That is such a lie.  I never got thrown out of Bill's bar.  You never even talked to me about break.  I never brought anyone to the IP room.  What an ass.  No, you didn't get thrown out of Bill's bar.  I removed you from behind the velvet ropes next to the stage.  No, you did not.  I don't know why you keep making these things up in your head.  Is this for the show? 
[01:40:00]  You know what, Twitchells, Twitchells, you're right, I'm wrong.  You're everything, I'm nobody.  That is not the case at all.  That is not the case at all.  All right?  I never said that.  I never said that.  First of all, I'm the most un-egotistical person that I can think of.  I'm so lucky to be a part of a show like this.  And you know what, Kenny?  I don't think you realize how fucking lucky you are.  All right?  You have no right to talk to people that way.  Yeah!  And act like, oh my God, dude.  You're making up blatant lies. 
[01:40:30]  And you're sitting there and you know it.  Why would Kenny make things up?  I'm not taking any sides here.  I'm just, you know, we're plowing through the testimony here.  But why would Kenny lie about something like that?  I have no idea.  I would definitely not lie about that at all.  I mean, that's just, first of all, talking about the virus tour, it just completely came out of left field.  Completely came out of left field. 
[01:41:00]  Everything he exactly said, exactly what I said is what he said to me.  And I would have no reason to make that up.  I'd have no reason to lie.  All right?  First of all, for the record, everybody says, okay, don't worry about it.  Kenny seems like he acts like everybody.  That's just his persona.  He's a dickhead to everybody, yada, yada, yada.  Well, that's fine.  If he has a reputation of being a dickhead, I understand that.  But that doesn't mean that you have to take it out on people, and you have to, there's a certain professionalism you've got to have. 
[01:41:30]  And he doesn't even know what that is.  I'm getting communiques from people that saw the whole incident, and they're saying, Twitchels, that you're lying.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying.  Get Pat from Menachia on the phone, too, please.  Let's get Pat on the phone.  Try to get him to testify.  We're just trying to get to the bottom of this.  So, Twitchels, you don't seem to like Kenny.  When did that start?  First of all, just, you know what?  I never not liked Kenny.  I would always try to be nice. 
[01:42:00]  I would always try to start a conversation.  I know when that thing was going on, a petition, when he lost his, when he was going to lose his job.  I don't know the whole story.  Something about the thing, you know, the whole conversation that happened with him.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's a pedophile.  Right, right.  I signed a petition.  I even sent emails of support to, you know, to back him up.  I was always trying to do everything I can to get on the guy's good side.  He just never seemed like he liked me.  All right, Kenny, hold on for one second.  I got Pat on the line, but I can't get all three of you on. 
[01:42:30]  Hold on.  Pat.  Hoppy.  Yeah.  You're on with Twitchels.  Hey, Twitchels.  Yeah.  Now, to be perfectly honest, I didn't hear every single word.  It was a rather short conversation, and I did not hear Kenny say, who the fuck do you think you are?  I heard him say, you're not for the main stage, and you're for the petting zoo, and he was pointing towards the stage, and then he was pointing towards the petting zoo, and that's basically what I heard. 
[01:43:00]  What now was, hold on, Twitchels, Twitchels, Twitchels, hold on.  Was one of them being confrontational a pet?  Well, Kenny, after he was asking about, he kind of kept going on about his concerns about the petting zoo.  Kenny kind of assured him about the, there was a production manager, a big guy.  He said he was going to protect them and everybody else in the petting zoo, and then he was sort of, he kept going on about the concerns. 
[01:43:30]  And then, and then that's when Kenny, Kenny, uh...  Diplopat.  ...shut somebody down verbally.  I mean, no, Kenny can be intimidating.  He intimidates me.  That's his job.  Well, that is his job.  That is his job.  Of course.  But, but there's a difference between being intimidating and being professional and doing his job, and saying, uh, who the fuck do you think you are, and, and, uh, you... 
[01:44:00]  That's why I didn't hear...  Twitchell's is saying, like, you know, I've tried to talk to Kenny and have some small talk or whatever.  Kenny doesn't have time for chit-chat.  No, no, yeah.  You know how many phone calls Kenny got, uh, in Worcester on Saturday?  Hundreds.  What was it?  Did Kenny get more calls than Twitchell's made from his hotel room?  Right.  All right, hold on, Pat.  Let's get back to Kenny.  Hey, Kenny.  Yes, hello.  All right.  Anything else you want to say to Twitchell's?  Uh, nah.  I'll, you know, just, uh, let him live and be well. 
[01:44:30]  God bless him.  Twitchell's, were you on something that might have made you think things that didn't really happen?  I, I, I, no, and, and to be completely honest, I did smoke before the show because my tics were really bad.  I was trying to calm down, and sometimes it does make me paranoid.  Why would you calm down?  The whole reason we had you, uh, part of the show at all was for you to twitch your ass off.  No.  So why are you trying to calm down the twitches?  No, no, it was, like, way before the show started just to initially calm down because it would have wore off like that.  No, instead of pot, you need, uh, coffee and Red Bull. 
[01:45:00]  That's the deal we've made with you.  Instant feedback's coming in.  Uh, Kenny should have punched him in the face.  Then he would have been Louis bleeding from the nostrils, Santani.  You know, just in my defense, I did not make up a lie, and I, it's no, it's no point to, to debate that.  And I wish him all the best as well.  You know what, though?  You know what I'm seeing here?  It's almost like that scene, that courtroom scene, where Kenny is being very calm, cool, and collected,  and you pretty much, like, you just exploded a few minutes ago on the phone calling Kenny, like, 
[01:45:30]  Piece of shit.  Piece of shit and awful things and a liar.  Because just, just, just thinking about that, I know, I, I, it happened to me.  So I know what happened.  And, you know, there was, you know, there was a few people around when it happened.  Everybody's story's gonna be different, but I know what happened to me just thinking of that.  He's definitely making me, you know, enraged right now.  Because I don't know how he has the nerve to just lie.  I don't, I don't think he would need to lie.  Why can't he just be honest and tell you?  That's exactly what he said. 
[01:46:00]  I'm not making that up.  Did you tell Pat from Unaki that you might be naked in the hotel room?  No.  Wow.  There's a lot of lying going on here.  Pat.  Pat.  Yes.  Did he tell you he might be naked in the hotel room?  Uh, he said he's open.  And, and that was, and that was, we were discussing the potential nakedness.  If you say one more wishy-washy thing, I had to chop off two more toes.  Can you fucking commit to anything, Pat? 
[01:46:30]  Well, no, no, no.  He said he'd be in plain underwear.  Holy shit.  You're going to work for this show.  You're perfect.  Hired.  So, so he didn't say anything about being naked?  Yeah.  No, yes, he did.  What did he say?  He said that he's used to, he's used to rooming with, uh, uh, comedians.  Right.  And that he's, he's very open.  And, and, oh, did he say very, he might, he might be naked. 
[01:47:00]  And he might be naked.  So Twitchels, why did you just say that you didn't talk to Pat about being naked in the hotel room?  I didn't talk to him about being, no, no, no.  What happened was, happened was I was taking off my shirt.  And he looked at me like I should, like I needed to go in the restroom to do it.  And, you know, I'm like, it's no big deal.  Like, I'm used, you know, I'm used to being around, you know, I'm used to growing up in theater.  I'm used to like, you know, traveling.  I've roomed with other guys.  It's no big deal.  You take off your shirt in front of me.  Were you hitting on Pat?  Were you hitting on Pat? 
[01:47:30]  I am cute.  Hey, Twitchels, did you say something about when Kenny does Jay Leno and then he can talk?  No, I did not.  No, I did not say that.  Somebody said that.  It was not me.  No, no, no.  No, wait, wait, wait.  Kenny said, Pat told me when he got back that Kenny told, Kenny told Pat to tell me,  and Pat can vouch for this because he told me that that's what I told him, say that when  the Short Crest tour can sell out or sell as many tickets as you guys did at the DCU Center, 
[01:48:00]  then I can have a backstage pass.  And for the record, swear on my life, I never even asked anyone.  I never asked about getting a backstage pass.  I asked Paul at first because I saw people walking around with it.  I never asked Kenny.  I didn't give a crap about that.  Once they gave us our little bracelets, I was fine.  I never asked anyone about that.  I got the whole thing here.  You do?  Yeah.  I mean, Twitch is paranoid to begin with.  He smoked a little herb before the show.  And he was out of his fucking mind.  He took everything seriously.  He thought he was hearing things to a point. 
[01:48:30]  And then you ran into Anthony crying your eyes out.  And then you spent the night in the hotel room that we paid for instead of being at the show.  The drugs got the best of you.  The drugs.  Got to get off the drugs, son.  Kenny did say those things to me.  And Pat can tell you right now.  Pat can't say anything.  He's not brave enough.  Pat's a hostile witness.  Yeah.  You call him up to testify and he turns on you.  No, Pat's a fucking, he's a noodle witness. 
[01:49:00]  He just fucking folds and mushes.  Yeah, I think you're going to fold on to questioning.  No, he didn't talk to her.  Pat, let's simplify this.  Paper or plastic?  Uh, paper.  Pat, who do they both have their good points and bad points?  Pat, who's being more truthful about the incident?  Uh, I believe Kenny's being, uh, accurate. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, Kenny can be, he was being intimidating.  Oh my God, you wishy-washy.  Hey, hey, fucking, hey, hey, uh, fucking, who's being more truthful about the incident?  Kenny, I believe, has a more accurate recollection of what happened.  You wordy jizzbucket.  Because he just, he, no.  Because I don't remember.  Yes.  Kenny, I believe, instead of saying Kenny, you're twiseled.  It depends on the definition of what, what's accurate is. 
[01:50:00]  I'll give you the definition.  You're a wishy-washy douche.  That's accurate.  Good, good punt there, sir.  Good punt?  You can't get mad at Pat.  You love Pat.  No, you just want to give him some fucking spine.  All right, Kenny?  Yes, hello.  I believe you, my friend.  Pat called you a faggot and a liar.  Yeah, it's all right.  You know, it's tough to be the disciplinarian, but I got big, broad shoulders. 
[01:50:30]  I can handle it.  And Twitchels, I'll say this to you.  I'm sorry that I upset you, but I'm not sorry for putting you in your place.  You know what, Kenny?  I'm just upset that you're not 100% true.  If you are not upset putting me in my place, then why don't you just tell me what you said to me?  You got nothing to lose.  I did call the truth, Twitchels, and if you listen to what you said, you basically admit it to everything, all right? 
[01:51:00]  You're doing double talk.  Yeah, I tend to believe the stone sober guy, not the guy that was smoking herb before everything went down.  I think Kenny probably talks like Kenny does, just like how Kenny is.  You know, we got things to do.  I mean, Kenny can make you feel stupid if you don't know him, and Twitchels being paranoid and high probably took it 50 degrees beyond where it should have been.  Right.  All right.  He said, we don't need you.  Did you not say that, Kenny?  Go over this.  Did you not say that?  Twitchels, I did say that.  I said, if you don't feel comfortable here, we're not going to make you do anything you don't feel comfortable doing, so you can leave. 
[01:51:30]  Absolutely.  And I did.  Absolutely.  But it wasn't because of that.  I left because of you, because of what you said to me, man.  And you just admitted it.  You just said that.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I said.  You were worried about having a bodyguard, and I told you nothing was going to happen.  There was a production manager in the village that was going to take care of you, and I told you, if you weren't comfortable, we weren't going to force you to do anything you didn't want to do. 
[01:52:00]  And if you wanted to leave, you were going to be fine.  And you know what?  You told me that.  You told me it was going to be fine, and I dropped it.  You came up to me five minutes later out of the blue and said, Twitchels, let me tell you something.  Let me talk to you.  Where's Barbara Walters when you need her?  And then you brought it up five minutes later after you already told me that.  Now, Twitchels, I didn't come up to you five minutes later.  That was in your dreams.  I had one encounter with you that was in front of Pat Munaki and Trey, the production guy from the village. 
[01:52:30]  Listen, I first brought it my concerns about that when you pinched the bracelets in the hallway.  And then when we had the confrontation, it was right in front of the petting zoo.  And that's when you said, you're a nobody, we don't need you, and yada, yada, yada.  And you just admitted to that.  Yeah, you're right.  So what's your point?  Thank you.  You just said I'm right. 
[01:53:00]  Jump.  I don't think there's anything else to say if you just said I'm right.  No, Kenny, did you call him a nobody?  Kenny?  What happened?  Kenny?  Kenny, you still there?  Just admit it, dude.  You're not going to lose your job.  Just admit it.  Did you call him a nobody?  I don't think Kenny's there.  No, I didn't call him a nobody.  No, I didn't call him a nobody.  Could you all have to answer that?  You should have.  Was Letterman brought up or Leno or something? 
[01:53:30]  Leno.  Leno?  Did I bring it up?  No, did it?  Did Twitchell's?  Did Twitchell's.  I heard, they got back to me that Twitchell's, his retort to when the short bus comedy tour can sit off the arena, then I'll be his road manager.  His retort to that was, well, did Kenny, you know, Kenny wasn't on Letterman.  Leno.  I mean, Leno, whatever.  And Twitchell's, you said that? 
[01:54:00]  I heard somebody say that.  I did not say that.  First of all, I went on Leno and shook my loose slab.  That's nothing.  I would never use that as a retort.  Give me a break.  Somebody said that, though.  I don't know who.  I didn't say that.  So, Lewis, Lewis, when did you start crying?  Is this Jimmy?  Yes.  What happened was, after he said that to me, and he was like, and he said, if you don't feel comfortable, you can leave.  This is after he just said, I'm a nobody, and you don't need yada, yada, yada.  And like I said, regardless of all that's true, I know he was stressed and busy.  I, as soon as he said that to me, and as soon as he said that, I just, I just, I just, I'm so, I'm such an emotional person. 
[01:54:30]  And all the shit I grew up with, it just felt like high school again.  To be completely honest with you, it just felt like high school again.  And I started to get really emotional, and I didn't want to ruin an experience for anybody else.  So, I decided that I would just leave and go back, and that was, wait, I would say, not a few minutes after it happened.  Then I left, and I walked back to the hotel.  I'm in the hotel walking through the hallway, and that's when I run into Anthony and Melinda. 
[01:55:00]  And then I was holding it up at that point.  And when I ran into Anthony, yeah, and Melinda, and they saw that I was upset, and they took notice of it, it just poured out.  It just, I broke in front of them.  So, I wasn't crying until I ran into them.  It just broke right in front of them.  But they could tell I was cheery-eyed and upset.  What did they say that set you off into tears?  Nothing.  I just wanted to get into them.  I didn't want anyone to see me that way.  I tried to go to the hotel, but I'm walking right in front of them. 
[01:55:30]  And they're looking at me.  I don't know if it was Anthony or Melinda that said, what's wrong?  But, you know, just initiating a conversation and just, I was to the point where if I opened my mouth to anyone, I was just going to break down.  I was trying to just stay stern and just walk to the hotel.  I'm a crybaby.  I admit that.  But if something hurts me, I can't help how I feel.  Exactly. 
[01:56:00]  Wichels, who did you call for 35 hours in the hotel room?  Huh?  Who did you call for 35 hours in the hotel room?  I made one call home.  What?  I made one call home.  You made three phone calls.  I made one phone call home. 
[01:56:30]  Made one phone call home to my mom.  I called my mommy.  The other two were from Pat trying to find his daddy.  Yeah, Pat.  Did Pat make calls?  Let's find out.  Pat?  Yes?  Did you make any phone calls from the hotel room?  No, I had my cell phone.  All right, let's go back to Kenny and Twichels.  All right.  Okay, someone is lying here.  Pat said he made no phone calls.  He had his cell phone.  There were three calls made from the room. 
[01:57:00]  Twichels, did you make three calls?  I called.  My phone was dead, first of all.  My phone ended up dying.  So I made a phone call to my mom.  I'm trying to think.  Trying to think.  I made one phone call to my mom.  I think.  I have the phone numbers.  It might have been like Pat or Paula because I was calling them to find out where they were  at one point.  I think.  I'm not sure.  All I remember, the only conversation I remember is calling my mom.  That's all I remember.  Wait, Kenny.  Kenny, what's the prices on the calls?  Are there two that are like a buck and then one that's like $33? 
[01:57:30]  One was $25 and the other one was like four something and five something.  Of course Kenny knows this info.  It's right in front of him.  He's got his thumb on it.  So we can call him tomorrow.  All right.  It was probably one.  Maybe it was a call to Pat or whatever and they charge you triple in a hotel.  So Twichels.  Yeah.  What did you end up doing while everyone was having a good time at the DCU Center?  I ended up chilling in the hotel room just trying to calm down. 
[01:58:00]  Anthony told me I should just go back and try to calm down and if I felt like going back,  go back.  If I didn't, I didn't.  And I just ended up falling asleep.  What's the last time you looked at the clock?  What time was it?  I forget.  Were you wondering what everybody was doing at that point?  Like would I be walking to the stage?  I have no idea.  I remember waking up when Pat came back after the show.  All right.  But I did leave the room for a little bit and went downstairs.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  People want to. 
[01:58:30]  Dave in Utah.  What's up?  This is Dave.  Dave?  Yeah.  What's up?  I'm calling it as a character witness for Kenny, man.  I don't have anything to lose or anything to gain from this.  But I went to an Orton show once with my girlfriend and we met Kenny.  He's the nicest fucking guy I've ever met.  So whatever Twitch will say is bullshit.  Character witness.  There you go.  Character witness is coming forward here.  Renee in Georgia.  Hello.  Hey.  I was Renee's.  I'm Renee's Vengeance.  I was on last week with my black underwear. 
[01:59:00]  Yes.  Point of reference.  I know you.  Yes.  And I spoke to Kenny.  I inadvertently offended him.  But he's very cool.  And I was a cop.  And I have to say that when you're doing security and the level of activities that he has to  take care of and working with people, you don't have time to coddle prima donnas and mince  words with people.  But you don't have to be rude.  And I don't think Kenny was.  Hey, Renee.  What was the thing you said that offended Kenny?  Did you comment on his hay dry hair? 
[01:59:30]  Well, this other guy was talking about getting a Desert Eagle.  And I said that that was either to collect or for men with small penises.  And he thought I was referring to carrying a 9 millimeter.  But I carry a 9 millimeter.  So it was funny.  Gun humor.  It's always a pisser.  That's what cops enjoy.  Thank you.  If it's not gun or racial, it's not funny.  Yes.  Double mint.  Whatever kind of gum you have.  All right.  Let's get out of here. 
[02:00:00]  Let's get out of here.  So, Twitchels, you're going to take a break from the show.  I'm here.  It's just, you know, being along so much by Terrence, it's usually getting a lot worse.  And I just think I just need a break from everything.  Just trying to calm down.  Why did you do that?  Why did you spend everyone laughing at me?  I'm sorry.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  You stop laughing at me.  And I'm sorry. 
[02:00:30]  Twitchels.  Stop laughing at me.  You're in a tough position.  Your Tourette's is getting worse, but that's the whole reason you're on the show.  Absolutely.  I got to tell you something.  I don't regret ever being on the show.  I love you guys.  You've done so much for me.  It's had nothing to do with me.  You know, I felt it coming, and I started turning around, and it was already over.  I knew you were hanging up. 
[02:01:00]  Bring on the next freak.  Kenny.  Yeah.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks, buddy.  All right.  Listen, I do the best I can for you guys, and I try to treat people like...  It had to happen.  Before the cliché tumbled out.  Oh, boy.  Here come the emails.  You look at Kenny's mouth is a cliché factory.  Here come the emails.  Bird in a hand.  Click.  Dude, that was too funny. 
[02:01:30]  Perfect.  I didn't see that one coming.  Pat Obenaki.  Hey, old.  Hey.  Well, at least you told the truth.  Ugh.  Whatever that was.  At least now Twitchels knows what the underside of that shirt bus looks like.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  How come you so, why are you so wishy-washy?  Yeah, really?  Because I, I.  He's like, I, I.  Exactly.  Beat it, fat body.  Click. 
[02:02:00]  He'll probably call back.  That wasn't my phone.  What happened?  Operator, we've been disconnected.  Best old ex-friend Ray.  Meh.  And that's how it ends today.  Yo, what's up?  This is Chris Rock, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome America's favorite stand-up comedian and her husband. 
[02:02:30]  How we doing, folks? This is Midget Fingers Voss.  The Voss and Bonnie Show.  Oh, this sucks already.  It's a baby crying.  That's a great way to open a show.  It's a baby crying.  Well, here's what it does.  That song puts me in a good mood, so I'm already in a good mood to start this off. 
[02:03:00]  I know, but you always want to use this song as your intro to go on stage to,  which seems you're not a paperback writer.  You're not even a paperback reader.  Well, here's the thing.  The thing about this song is it's about an artist.  A writer is an artist, and there's no songs about poets or, you know,  as an artist, you feel like, hey, I'm coming out to a song about another artist.  You see what I'm saying? 
[02:03:30]  And it's a good song.  It does put it, look, everybody in the room right now is smiling over the song already.  All right?  They're already smiling.  I think they're smiling because they're like, this is going to be a trade run.  Well, we can cut the song.  We already got the point out.  Here's the deal.  You know, OBS asked me the other day, he said, you want to do between 11 and 12?  I said, yeah, I'd love to do it.  He said, you know, we're not going to really talk about addiction because I'm going to try  to do another show on addiction, you know, about drug addiction, gambling.  Right, and I'm not sober.  I mean, I'm not that drunk, but. 
[02:04:00]  No, but you've been, you're not an addictive person.  So I said, well, why don't we come up and talk about comedy, stand-up comedy,  because we're both, I mean, I've been doing comedy 23 years.  You've been doing it for like 11 now?  10 or 11.  12 years.  12 years.  And we know about it.  But then, of course, they slammed us, right?  You know, who wants to hear about that?  Which a lot of people do want to hear about road stories and getting laid on the road  and the nightmares of the clubs.  So they slammed that.  Then I said, well, maybe we'll talk about family, because you're from, like, you have 
[02:04:30]  like a perfect family.  Your parents were married.  How long have your parents been married together?  40 years, I guess.  40.  My sisters, yeah.  Yeah, so your parents have been married 40 years, the same.  And what haven't they done during, you know, it's 40 years, you know.  Well, my mom, one time, I swear to God, when I was maybe, you know, 12 or 13, walked into  the room, my sister and I were doing homework.  I have no idea why she said this, but she said, you know, your father and I have never  had oral sex. 
[02:05:00]  And then my sister, without missing a beat, said, no wonder Dad's so unhappy.  And then we just all went back to doing what we were doing.  Wait, how old were you?  Like, maybe 12 or 13.  Is that correct?  I have no idea why that happened.  Well, because maybe he was trying to get her to do it at that time.  But she would just walk in.  I mean, it wasn't like a family that talked about sex.  It was a, you know.  Well, you pretty much have a stable family.  You grew up, you know, with all your sisters.  I grew up on a farm without running water.  How stable is that?  Yeah, but you had family.  No matter what, you had family.  I come from a broken home, completely like, you know, where, you know, my father would come 
[02:05:30]  to my house, like, you know, your father would come visit you every couple weeks, and he  would try to get everything in on one visit.  Like, he'd come in my room when I was asleep, wake me up, he'd hit me, right?  Then he'd lecture me, then he'd take us out to eat, then he'd give us money and leave.  He'd got everything in on one.  No sexual abuse?  No, none whatsoever.  Verbal, but not really bad.  Now, my mom would use us as pawns, you know, between her, you know, you don't know who 
[02:06:00]  was more screwed up, my mother and my father.  Like, my father would come from New York to see us, and it'd be like every two weeks, and  we'd go, oh, we can't wait till, you know, dad gets here.  And, you know, you're looking out the window.  Is he here yet?  Is he here yet?  Then all of a sudden, you see him pull up.  Daddy's here.  And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, cops come and arrest him, right?  You know, my mother used, well, so here's the thing.  So my mother would use us, my mother would use us as pawns to set up my father, right?  So you're going, who's more fucked up?  My father for not paying child support, or my mother for using us to set him up to get 
[02:06:30]  him arrested.  So they're both fucked up.  So what I'm saying is, so I said, well, why don't we talk about family?  Because so many people have come from broken homes or good homes and how it affected them  growing up, you know.  Well, why do you think that's why you're a comic?  Well, no, it's one of the reasons, it's one of the reasons I got into drug addiction, because  as a kid growing up from a broken home, you don't get the attention you're supposed to  get.  You don't get attention.  And that's what kids need to grow up, is to have attention.  So if you're not getting that, you'll go for any attention. 
[02:07:00]  You'll go for negative attention, you know, because negative attention is better than no  attention.  So you grow up and you start doing things to get your attention.  You know, you're breaking windows at schools.  You're cutting class.  You're stealing.  You're doing whatever.  You know, then it escalates.  You start hanging out with the other kids from broken homes and you start doing, you  know, you start doing breaking and enderings.  You get into drugs and it builds and it just escalates to smoking crack and, you know, giving  head. 
[02:07:30]  So what I'm saying, why are you laughing?  This is great stuff.  All right.  This guy's 12 years old.  What the fuck has he experienced?  How old are you?  Well, he's maybe never sucked a cock.  Well, that was a joke.  How old are you?  I'm 22.  22.  So you've experienced none of this.  I've been sober 20 years.  I was in rehab when you were two.  You were shitting in your diapers when I was in rehab.  So all you do is work the fucking board and you listen to what I say, douchebag.  All right.  Don't you ever laugh at Rich Voss because I guess I'm fucking serious shit here.  You're a comedian. 
[02:08:00]  You don't want people laughing at you.  So here's the deal.  What I'm saying to the people calling.  Any topic you want to talk about, family, addiction, relationships, comedy, that's it.  Right?  Yeah.  We got somebody on the line.  Steven from Ohio wants to talk about comedy.  Does that sound good?  Yeah.  Anybody calls up and says, hey, you're a hack or this and that.  We've heard it all.  It's all bullshit.  All right.  Hey, you stink, you slobbering, mush mouth, douchebag.  Just let people have it.  All right.  Go ahead.  Who?  What's his name?  Steven from Ohio.  Go ahead, Steven. 
[02:08:30]  Steve, go ahead.  You're on the air.  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  I have a question.  I'm not going to call you a hack or anything like that.  I just started doing comedy probably about six months ago.  I did my first gig and it was like an open mic thing.  And I totally bombed, of course.  And I have not even been able to write comedy since.  So, like, it's just been so, like, I've been so discouraged.  So, do you guys have any, like, advice you can give me?  Well, the thing is, is that it's, I mean, it's going to be years and years of that. 
[02:09:00]  No, it won't be years and years, but.  Well, I mean, you'll have some good shows, but, I mean, you continually bomb for a long  time if you're going to be a good comic.  Well, here's a couple.  You have to take risks and.  Here's a couple.  The first time.  I feel like I have writer's block, though, you know what I mean, ever since that first  bomb.  Well, because probably.  And I haven't been able to get back up there since.  So, just do the same jokes that you already did.  It doesn't mean they're bad jokes.  Yeah.  And also, the first time I went on stage was, you pulled a number.  It was at Catch the Rising Star.  And this was the biggest club in New York.  And you pulled a number. 
[02:09:30]  When I got on, I bombed.  So, I'm telling you, it was so bad, right?  I mean, I took.  And I took the bus in from New Jersey.  I had to go back to the poor authority.  And I really wanted to swallow a bullet.  I don't know what's sad or your family story or this one.  Well, here's the thing, too.  A good thing for you to do is to try to host at places as much as you can.  Because you can do a few minutes.  You can do five minutes.  You can always bail out, right?  So, you're talking about, like, just bringing people on.  Well, you do some time off. 
[02:10:00]  There's a problem with hosting.  If you bomb off the top in your first, like, you know, you get your seven minutes at the beginning.  You still, if the audience hates you, you still have to keep going back up.  That's true.  It kind of sucks.  When I first started comedy, and this was, you know, 23 years ago, like the second year, I started.  I booked a couple rooms, one-nighters in my hometown.  Like, I would go into these bars, and we'd do comedy on Tuesday, and I would book it.  I would book the comics, and I would host the shows.  And, you know, it just got me stage time and some extra cash.  But I would just say, keep going on stage.  You're not going to do, you know, how many people go into work the first day and knock it out, you know? 
[02:10:30]  So, if you want to keep...  How old are you?  22.  Yeah, go do it again.  What's the big deal?  Keep doing it until you have a good set, and then you go, oh, I love this.  You know what I mean?  But if you ever come to New York after you start doing it, don't come up to me like you fucking know me.  You know, hey, I took you on the phone.  Thanks a lot.  Big deal, all right?  Just do your fucking jokes.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  What?  Am I mean?  Am I too mean?  You know how all the emcees, when we work on the road, you know, they're always like, you know, if I come to New York, what can you do? 
[02:11:00]  I give them that impression.  Because I've just spent a lot of time in the green room talking to them.  When we go on the road, like, Bonnie, it's like good...  Like, I don't hate the comics.  I'm just quiet.  They think that you do, though.  They're always like, is he always this mean?  Well, I just don't like talking, you know?  And you'll be so friendly to him.  And, you know, oh, Bonnie's...  Well, I'm lonely.  Like, I'll always say to the comics, the emcee, as we're leaving after the week, you know, we do four days and I'll go to the emcees.  Well, first of all, set it up.  He won't talk to the emcee.  A little. 
[02:11:30]  You won't.  You don't talk to them.  And then you always say mean things about them on stage, which, you know, it's a joke, but whatever.  And then at the end of the week, they're excited because you're a big comic and stuff.  They want to meet you.  And then you'll talk to them a little bit at the end of the week.  And then you go, do you have my phone number?  And they go, no.  And you go, good.  And you walk away and leave.  That's so mean.  No one talk to me.  Listen, I try to help people out.  You know, comics, yes, or help.  You're actually really nice, but, I mean, it's...  You know, that's the thing about comics is when they first start, they don't understand that it actually is a job at some point. 
[02:12:00]  Like, you know, they're still doing it like, oh, I'm so excited about getting on stage every night.  You know, when you're...  You know, last year, we were on the road at least three weeks out of the month every single month for...  I mean, it went on forever.  Yeah.  It's a job.  It's like a grueling job.  Yeah, so, and then it's like if you're at that job, if you're like a president at IBM or something, or vice president, and then some new guy comes in and starts asking you a lot of questions, you just want to fucking kill him.  You know, you're going to have to trial and error.  That's the only way. 
[02:12:30]  Who else do you got on the phone?  I can't...  You know, when I see this laughing in the other room, that's how insecure it goes.  They're probably listening to somebody else's CD.  Oh.  I think this is going well already.  Uh, yeah.  We, uh...  Some people want to talk about addiction and stuff.  Go back to that.  Yeah.  Anything they want to talk about in the...  All right, cool.  Brian.  Brian from D.C.  Go ahead, buddy.  What's happening?  Yeah, you're an idiot, all right?  You're a gigantic moron.  Take your pop psychology and just flush it down the toilet. 
[02:13:00]  Tell me why is that.  I was beaten brutally as a child.  Yeah.  I was beaten brutally as a teenager.  Yeah.  I have never done a drug in my life.  But you got a lot of inner anger.  No, you're right.  You got a lot of inner anger.  But here's the thing.  I didn't say...  I didn't say...  Listen, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You said that getting beaten leads to this shit.  And it doesn't.  I didn't say everybody who comes from this situation does drugs.  I said I did.  I said I did.  I go, that was how I dealt with it.  No.  Trying to get your attention.  I didn't say...  If you get beaten, it leads to these... 
[02:13:30]  I never said beaten.  No, that's what you want to hear.  That's what you want to hear.  But what I'm saying is people come...  But I think this guy, honestly, though, I mean, he's misunderstood you.  But I think he's right.  It's like you don't have to be a victim just because, you know, you've had a hard life.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  A lot of people do come through it.  It's not the excuse, Rich.  No, no, no.  It's not the excuse.  I was saying my...  How it led for me into drugs.  I said I was doing stuff...  Okay, maybe I phrased it wrong and said people.  It was me.  Okay?  I'm sorry. 
[02:14:00]  What I'm saying is I did everything to try to get attention.  And it was always negative and it escalated.  For me, okay?  If I phrase it wrong, I'm sorry and you're right.  Everybody who comes from a broken home or comes from beatings or whatever doesn't turn out to be a drug addict.  And there's people from the best homes on the planet with the most loving parents that become full-blown drug addicts.  Absolutely, and I work with high school kids right now.  Some of them who come from great homes, who turn into real schmucks, and others who come from the worst possible households that you can imagine. 
[02:14:30]  And these kids leave those houses and go on to make better things out of themselves because they don't use something else to blame for their problems.  They say, I own this problem.  I'm going to fix it.  Do you think as a teacher, and you'll see this and you'll notice, don't you think a kid will grow up and have a better chance of growing up to be a good kid that grows up with attention and affection? 
[02:15:00]  Do you think that's true?  That a kid growing up with that will have a better shot at succeeding?  Honestly, it depends.  If you take a kid who's growing up with attention and affection in the Midwest versus a kid who grows up with attention and affection in the inner city in Philadelphia, two different atmospheres.  You will not find a kid who is going to turn out the same with the same types of environment.  It's not just in the home. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  If your parents are a-holes to you, but your friends love you.  You can say asshole.  Yeah, go ahead.  That's true.  I'm sorry.  If your friends love you, but your parents beat you, you could turn out to be great.  But if your friends are complete shit and get you and help you and convince you because you're young to go and go with them and start doing some of these stupid little things,  and they don't respect you enough to say, you know what, you don't want to smoke weed.  We will.  We're not going to ask you to. 
[02:16:00]  Then you're not going to turn out as well as you would have if you had been able to stand on your own.  It's not just the family.  It's the friends.  Because you actually spend more time in school with your friends than you do with your family, actually.  Here's the thing.  You're talking about 10, 11, 12, 13.  I'm talking about 17.  Okay, okay.  I'm talking about a kid at 3 and 4 and 5 years old that isn't hanging, that gets that attention and affection as a minor at 3, 4, and 5 year old. 
[02:16:30]  So, subconsciously, inside builds up self-worth.  Okay?  And that's where, that's where it starts from.  That's the foundation.  The foundation doesn't start at 14 and 15.  It starts at 3, 4, and 5.  No, but if you learn, if it's 3, 4, and 5, even if that child doesn't get the love and affection that they want, but they learn how that they're able to live without it, I'm not saying it's a good thing, but what I'm saying is that 3, 4, and 5, if that child, even though they don't get love and affection in the home, they still survive without it. 
[02:17:00]  They'll learn that later on in life, they can depend on themselves more.  And they grow up not showing love.  But if it's 3, 4, and 5, they're constantly begging for it, and they don't get it, then yes, in your situation, it turns into something even worse.  Okay, well, if I phrase that thing wrong, anyhow, thanks for calling, man.  Oh, wait, wait, he called you an idiot.  I wouldn't say thanks for calling.  Well, we settled it.  I think we came up with a good, even solution.  He didn't apologize.  He had a lot of anger.  He was.  He's angry because he got beaten as a kid. 
[02:17:30]  Leave him alone.  He had a lot of passion, though.  No, he was right, though.  I think that his theory of that you spend a lot more time with your friends than they could teach you as much.  But that's bullshit because when you're 4, 5, and 6 years old, that's where you're building your foundation for life.  And you're not running the streets at that age.  Well, then how do you explain why some kids overcome it and some kids don't?  Because they're foundation.  I think there's a lot of different factors that are involved.  Yeah, there's tons of different factors, but I still think the strength comes from the foundation, 
[02:18:00]  and the foundation starts at a very early age.  So, who else is on the phone and what do they want to talk about?  Okay, go ahead.  Are we all right?  Yeah, it's just boring to me, but whatever.  I think, how's it, then what do you want to talk about that's not boring to you?  I don't know.  Add a joke once in a while.  Say something funny.  Let's keep it.  We're having good conversations.  It's fucking boring to me.  That's how crazy you're getting.  Because that's no fucking solution.  Oh, this is boring to me.  Well, fucking add something.  I've been yapping.  I try. 
[02:18:30]  You keep yelling over me.  I agree with the last guy.  I do agree with him.  You're fucking sellout.  You're like fucking Benedict Arnold.  Look, if I don't agree with him, I'll call him an asshole.  I'll hang up on him.  But I don't want to.  You know, this is boring.  What the fuck?  We've been on for 15 minutes.  I know.  This is boring me.  Jesus Christ.  You want to skydive as we're doing this?  Yeah.  You know, fuck.  Obviously, it's not boring to people because they're still calling.  Look, the phones are all lit up here at the Rich and Bonnie show. 
[02:19:00]  All right, let's go.  Is that little fucking Q-tip mad at me for attacking him?  He's not that sensitive.  He's fine.  Let's try going back to the comedy arena.  Donnie from Boston.  Go ahead with your question, buddy.  Hey, Rich.  Yeah, Bonnie.  I'm a comic up here in Boston.  What's that?  And I want to know what the progression is.  I've been doing a lot of open mic nights, and I've been invited to a lot of, you know,  nights, but I'm not getting paid yet.  When should I start thinking about getting an agent or a booker or something? 
[02:19:30]  You know what?  Are they calling from the back room here?  I don't know what that was.  Oh, who knows when, you know, I mean, you don't walk into, you know, Broadway Danny Rose's  office and say, hey, be my agent.  It just happens, you know, right?  You get an agent or a manager, it just falls into place.  In the beginning, an agent or a manager, it's overrated, I think.  I mean, really, I mean, until you get good, why do you need one?  Are they going to get you better open mics?  Here's the thing, anyhow.  You get all the stage time you can up in Boston, but you're going to eventually have to move 
[02:20:00]  to New York or Los Angeles to, right, most likely make anything happen, you know?  So that's the next progression for me is to get my time in.  It's just, you know what, how long have you been doing it?  It's been about eight, nine months.  Yeah, you've got to wait years.  You know, it's going to take, like, it's going to take three years before you can even.  What you do is get as much stage time and do as many gigs as you can.  It really is one of the slowest moving career choices you could possibly take. 
[02:20:30]  You're so naked.  I'm not naked.  I'm just saying, I'm just being realistic.  Everybody thinks it's going to happen fast.  It's slow.  You've been doing it 22 years.  23, yeah.  You know, whatever.  Norn's been doing it, I don't know, probably 15 or 16.  Like, you know, it takes a long time.  It's like people don't get there in six years.  It just doesn't happen.  Some people do.  Some people do.  I know.  Some people make a good living in six years.  Well, okay.  Okay, depends, I guess, depends what you're shooting for.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  You know, you want to be a middle on the road in six years, you can do it.  Well, you just got to shoot for stage time and get funny.  That's all, right?  In the beginning.  Then eventually you come to New York or L.A.  And so I would say New York without any doubt before L.A.  If you want to just, you know, for comedy.  Well, L.A.'s not a good stand-up town, I don't think.  It's so tough to get on stage there.  There's no stage time, yeah.  Here, there's a million clubs.  I'll come open for you guys.  Well, I'll tell you, Boston, I don't know about, I don't know the scene.  Do you have our number?  Good.  I don't know the scene.  Boston used to be the hottest comedy club scene in the country, one of the hottest. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, I know.  I mean, it's the strongest comics came out of Boston.  Sweeney, Kenny Rogerson, Gavin, Lenny Clark, Kevin Meany, Steve Ryan.  They had, like, so many clubs.  It was the hottest, hottest city.  And it's just, you got to be in a city where there's a lot of clubs that are just getting on stage.  All right.  Anyway, good luck.  Thank you.  All right, cool.  You guys want to take your quick break?  No, this is going too fucking good.  All right.  We'll do one more call and then we'll take a break.  She really pisses me off. 
[02:22:00]  Was that boring you?  Was that a good, are you?  No, I'm ecstatic.  Telling people about, what point should I go from being an open mic-er to, uh, when they decide to pay you?  Well, somebody offers you some money.  You know what?  Here's the thing.  You're, you're being like I am on the road.  These are questions that no one's answered them.  You know, these are questions you had.  I remember when I was starting off, I was going up to headliners.  Hey, do you want to take me on the road?  I was the same douchebag and, you know, jackass trying to grovel for any type of work I could, you know? 
[02:22:30]  And, uh, you know, so I'm not going to be like some prima donna, you know?  I'm going to try to help them like I always do.  All right.  I'll be bad cop on this one.  Well, I don't know.  I just, you know, you, you, you.  I do this.  This is what I do everywhere we go on the road in the green room talking to the other comics.  This is what I do.  I answer these questions all week when you don't talk to anybody.  You act like you're, you're this, you know, great guy that's going to, you know, give advice to everyone. 
[02:23:00]  You don't.  You ignore them.  And now on the radio, you're trying to pretend like this is what we do as professional comedians.  We help the ones beneath us and we pull them up.  Well, you don't.  I do.  I live it.  So if I make fun of it on the radio, you know, cut me some slack.  Cause I actually do it in real life.  Well, last night when we were sitting at Caroline's, that comic walked in.  Did I make a call to get him on stage last night?  Do I try to help?  Yeah.  We both do. 
[02:23:30]  You know.  That's cause he books a room in Vegas and you know it.  Well, you know.  Comic bookers are.  What?  They're a slippery slope.  I know when they book a good room.  They book a room and then you gotta like.  You gotta put them on stage.  You gotta help them out.  It's like, you know, and if they're not, and if they, if they're not that good, you  can't really say it cause you want to work their room.  Right.  You know, you can't say, uh, I can't, you know, I can't make a call for you because  you stink.  No, but you always have to tell the person you're, uh, you know, pitching them to that 
[02:24:00]  they, they book a room.  Yeah.  So everybody knows what's going on.  Well, this guy was standing right next to me as I'm making a call.  I know.  You didn't even know his last name.  You act like you're best friends with him.  Uh, all right, let's bring the love back in here.  Toby from Iowa.  You got a question.  Go ahead.  Iowa?  Yeah.  Toby, what's happening?  Yeah, uh, I love the show so far.  I just had a question for Rich.  Thank you.  Toby's retarded.  What did you use, what did you use as a, uh, as a pickup line when you first met Bonnie? 
[02:24:30]  Uh, uh, well, this is good.  Ramon, get this dude off the radio!  Ramon!  That was good.  Bonnie's snatch!  Oh, I don't get it.  Was that a setup to...  Yeah, he just got Ramon'd.  They tend to run out of gas after one or two, though, so...  That was pretty good, though.  He got me, though.  Yeah, because you were buying.  I was buying into it, and I was thinking, what line did I use?  All right.  You know what line you use. 
[02:25:00]  What?  What did I use?  I didn't use any line.  I said, let's go get pizza.  No, you didn't.  When I came down to the steps at the comedy cellar, and I said, oh, you're Rich Voss.  I wanted to meet you, and you go, oh, you're that comic girl.  I'd hit on you right now, but I'm already on a date.  Oh, you're right.  I was on a date.  That is a good line.  That was what I said.  All right.  So let's try to get one real caller before breaking.  Lee from Pennsylvania.  Go ahead, buddy.  Hey, Rich.  I've got a question for you.  I was just curious what your secret was to quit smoking, because I've tried almost everything, 
[02:25:30]  and I've smoked like four or five packs a day.  Holy crap.  And I want to quit bad.  It's just for real.  I don't have a secret.  I just said I got to stop.  I'm at 10 weeks right now and two days, and I'm just trying to look at it like when I  quit drinking and doing drugs, just like a day at a time, just not, and I'm not going  to lie.  I'm chewing Nicorette gum, you know, so I mean, I don't have all the nicotine out of  myself.  I've tried all that, and the longest I quit is four days. 
[02:26:00]  If you keep trying, you know, there's a better chance that you'll quit.  I know.  I was up to three packs.  It's smoking is so, because like when you quit crack or heroin or whatever, you're not  doing it 80 times a day or 60 times a day like cigarettes.  Cigarettes is everything you do, you know, and I mean, I'm not the one to ask about cigarettes  because it's 10 weeks from me.  I'm just not, I'm just doing everything in my power not to pick them up and a ton of  food, you know, but I chew Nicorette gum a lot, you know, just say, do it like, you 
[02:26:30]  know, I don't know if you drink or not drink, but just say, today I'm not going to smoke,  all right, or if it goes down, this hour I'm not going to smoke, this hour, I'm not going  to smoke this hour, I'm not going to smoke the next hour, every hour until it builds  up into a day, into two days, into a week, that's, that's the best way.  But there's a lot of tools that you can use to help you, so find whatever combination  of those tools will work for you.  You know, because you got, you know, like they say to me, like when I quit drugs, I really  wanted to, but I didn't want to quit smoking, but you got to, you know, you have 
[02:27:00]  to, right?  How do you get Ramon'd?  I quit doing, you know, I did coke and speed, other stuff, I put all that down, I still drink  occasionally, but man, like you said the other day, I was listening to the show you were on,  and it's, I don't know, they've got a grip.  Just do it an hour at a time, man, you know, just try an hour at a time.  Good luck, and hey, listen, fuck, it's not, it's the hardest thing I've ever done.  All right, well, thanks, y'all. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  All right, cool.  Let's take a break now.  All right, okay, good.  That's his sign-off, take a break now.  Addiction-free radio, the boss and Bonnie show.  You know, it's going to be like a Larry David type, only without a script.  It's the worst ever being Anthony.  And now, coming to the radio, Mr. and Mrs. Bonnie McFarlane.  I would say it's too early in the morning to do this, but I would suck at this in the afternoon. 
[02:28:00]  The Voss and Bonnie show.  Oh, boy, this sucks.  I'll tell you what doesn't suck is my DVD is now on Amazon.com.  You can buy my DVD, which I guarantee is 55 minutes of laughter,  and I think it's also in some Best Buys.  And come to see Bonnie and I.  Where are we at this week?  We're in Fort Lauderdale.  What's your name at?  I don't know what it is.  The Improv in Fort Lauderdale.  Oh, okay.  I just follow you. 
[02:28:30]  I don't know what I'm doing.  Thursday through Sunday, Fort Lauderdale Improv.  All right, so Bonnie had a good point during break that I have to slow down a little.  I get too excited.  And you're 100% right, especially when I'm being attacked.  And it's not really easy to do a show with somebody as they're sitting there on their phone playing Bejeweled.  Okay, when that is more important than her career Bejeweled.  All right, all right, all right.  My career?  Well, I'm just saying.  Oh, we got one hour for our own show. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What do you think people start off at?  All right, all right.  Well, I don't want my own radio show, so.  Good.  I'm cutting you loose anyhow.  You're just bringing me down on this too.  Good.  Good.  Cut me loose.  All right, we got another question from a gentleman from Whack Bag.  Go ahead, sir.  Hello.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hello.  Whack, what's up, buddy?  What's happening?  It's a Ramon.  It is a Ramon.  It's a kid Africa.  It's not a Ramon.  Oh, it's kid Africa.  What's happening, man?  I wanted to ask you a question about being a comedian. 
[02:29:30]  Oh.  Whenever I said this was kid Africa.  When are you going to start?  What's that?  When are you going to start?  That's it?  That's what you got?  Come on.  What do you expect?  But come on.  Now, first, don't you think you should open this call with, hey, thank you for getting  me in on Saturday to the show?  I'm not going to put you on blast like that.  Well, but then you're the first one to write, hey, can you hook me up?  Don't you think?  All right.  It was funny.  It was funny.  I know.  It is good.  It is good to hear. 
[02:30:00]  God bless callers who love comedy.  I know.  Where were you there Saturday?  How come no one saw you?  It's one thing kid Africa never does.  That's why no one saw me.  I wasn't smiling.  I was wondering when you get paid to do stand up.  When should I start worrying about that?  Well, I mean, kid Africa started off with really funny.  I mean, emails to each other that was so racial.  I know.  I remember those.  I was frightened.  And then I don't know where it just turned around.  But I mean, it turned around.  I came to see you.  But you'll still trash me, though, on Black Bad. 
[02:30:30]  That's nice.  He's got a little sentimentality towards the old days.  Well, but the good thing about kid Africa, she is black, obviously, by his name, is that he knows how to write.  And he could do all that stuff.  You know, he has a computer and everything.  Right.  It's amazing.  Yeah, I'm just incredibly horrible on the phone, though.  No, you're not.  Did you have a good time?  Absolutely.  Hey, guess what?  Why?  All right.  That was for you, Rich.  Thank you.  All right.  I've got another question about addiction.  Rob from Long Island.  Go ahead.  Hey, Rich.  First, I want to say congratulations on 10 months of no smoking. 
[02:31:00]  That's great.  10 weeks, but thank you.  Thank you.  And the advice that you gave the other guy about the three and four packs a day, I mean, that guy's got a problem.  And I hope he follows suit.  My problem is that I have an addiction to buying defective luxury automobiles on eBay.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What a car this guy is.  You know what's funny is because they set it up perfectly because you think, oh, this is a real call.  No, I thought it was a Ramon because that was too positive. 
[02:31:30]  You gave him good advice.  He didn't give him good advice.  Take it one hour at a time.  He's going to have a cigarette every hour.  Remember how fucking horrible that car was when we went to look at it?  Yeah.  The sauerkraut in the trunk.  But you know what?  I bought so many things off of eBay and less than half the times I've gotten robbed.  That's nice.  You know, a lot of golf clubs.  Didn't you buy a wallet or something that was a fake Louis Vuitton?  It was a fake Louis Vuitton wallet for 200 bucks. 
[02:32:00]  And I took it to every, we were in four major cities in a row, like Pittsburgh and Cleveland,  where they had Louis Vuitton stores.  And every Louis Vuitton store I went into with this wallet, they go, we don't make this.  Then I wrote back to the person, they wouldn't give me the money back.  And they were Asian.  And it just turned into me smashing that Asian guy or lady.  And I never got my money back.  And I sent them back to a wallet.  So not only do I.  Oh, you didn't get your money back?  I never got my money back.  I never got my money.  Oh, it's a big deal.  200 bucks.  Live and learn.  All right.  Who's next?  All right. 
[02:32:30]  Rob from New Jersey.  Rob, go ahead, buddy.  Rob in Jersey, me?  Yeah, go.  Oh, what's up, Rich?  I just wanted to shut your wife up and tell you, do give advice to comics.  Hang up on this guy.  No, no, no, no, no.  Shut up, buddy.  Good for you.  They don't come often.  What's happening?  Let Rich have his moment in the sun.  But wait.  I've had a lot.  It's pouring right now.  I had some questions that only, you know, an older comic could answer, and I emailed Rich 
[02:33:00]  and Jim Norton, and Jim Norton, and I'm still waiting for an email, and Rich was kind enough  to help me out.  Oh, really?  Oh, that is so sweet.  I try to answer my email.  Oh, that is so nice.  Is it nice?  What was your question to him in the email?  Well, I was barking for a while.  Mm-hmm.  Like, I was getting ripped off, you know, because I'd put in, like, five hours.  Do people know what barking is?  Do you think?  What?  Do you think people know what barking is?  Well, let him explain, and then we'll tell you what barking is. 
[02:33:30]  I want him to explain.  Basically, you're the asshole who hands everybody flyers that they throw on the ground.  Okay.  They throw them on the ground.  Yeah, a lot of times, unfortunately.  But so now, I don't really, I never had to bark or anything, so...  You will when we get home tonight.  Do you have to have a certain amount of people come to the show in order for you to get on  stage?  No, I didn't have, like, a certain amount.  I just had to try.  Oh, you just had to go out there and give it a shot?  What?  You just had to go out there and give it a shot, and then you could get on stage? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  But, you know, my sex appeal, I got them in the door.  It's the biggest scam clubs are doing, comedy clubs, is they won't do their own promotion,  so what they do is send out new comics with flyers to get people to come into the room.  Right.  And then, you know, these half of the people in the audience don't even want to be at a  show.  They were just browbeaten into coming in.  Right.  And these comics want to get on stage, you know.  Instead of the clubs advertising saying, okay, maybe Tuesday night is New Talent or open  mic night where these guys get a shot, they have these guys running around like they're 
[02:34:30]  selling suits, you know what I mean?  And it's just the biggest scam, and these fucking clubs are ruining their clubs with  this, and it's fucked up for comics.  It's tough enough to get on stage and be funny and write new material, then all of a  sudden now you're a fucking promoter?  Oh, you know what?  You know what?  Okay.  That's all right.  But then when we get in the car, and you talk about how fucked up it is for comics and  this and that, and you know what? 
[02:35:00]  Fuck them.  No, I agree with you.  I'm just trying to be funny.  God, take it easy.  No, you are.  So what was your question to him in the email?  No, I hung up on him.  Oh, God.  You guys were going off.  So let's go to Lincoln in Pennsylvania.  Go ahead, Lincoln.  You're on, buddy.  Lincoln.  Hey, I just wanted to mention that it's great that a married couple argue almost as much  as me and my wife.  Great.  How long are you married?  I'll have to do it for more.  How long have I been married?  Yeah.  Two years.  Wow.  We're not even a year. 
[02:35:30]  September will be a year.  I don't think we're going to make it.  Well, September will be two years for me.  September 17th.  And you know what?  A lot of people still haven't given us our presents, still stiffed us.  When that September 17th rolls around, I'm going to really know who to hate.  Yeah.  That fucking Lynn.  Oh.  I don't want to say her name.  No, because I don't want her to think it's my friend Lynn Chakra.  No, no, no.  It's Lynn.  The other Lynn, Coplish.  Fuck her.  She's, you know, we're at the comedy salon.  She's talking about comics.  They didn't give us a gift.  And she's like, oh, how could they not give you the gift?  Well, I'm going to take care of you guys.  I know I was invited, but I didn't show up at the wedding. 
[02:36:00]  But I'm going to take care of you.  Fuck her.  We haven't seen shit from her.  Douchebag.  That's why I won't let her fucking work with me at the fucking Florida Improv in Fort Lauderdale  this week.  You're a very passionate man.  I am.  These jerk-off comics, they have no fucking class.  They're just low fucking low.  Billy Burr, all the money he's making.  He couldn't come with a gift.  That douchebag, a hundred bucks.  What about Patrice?  He threw like a couple wrinkled dollars at him.  Patrice, you don't expect it from him.  All right.  He doesn't have any, you know, he doesn't know.  He didn't grow up going to weddings and stuff like that. 
[02:36:30]  He wasn't invited to events.  He's fucking Patrice.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Bobby, Bobby Kelly has class.  You know why?  He knew.  All right.  Because he's got a girlfriend.  That's why.  Who's next?  All right.  It's so uneven.  What do you mean?  It just goes from like you ranting to next call, take a break.  It's good.  This is good fucking radio.  I hate to tell you.  Oh, okay.  Why do you hate to tell me?  Because I've listened to a lot of radio and I've done a lot of radio.  All right.  There's no dead air.  There's no bullshit. 
[02:37:00]  You know, this is some real shit.  All right.  John from Arkansas.  You over a view.  What's his name?  Went, yep.  John, go ahead.  Yeah, I just want to say, I agree with Bonnie.  This shit is boring.  Y'all should have just put a gag in Rich's mouth and give Bonnie a dildo.  I wouldn't have had the best hour already.  All right.  Now you've taken it too far.  All right.  Sex is the easiest thing to do.  Fucking fall back on sex.  All right.  All right. 
[02:37:30]  So let's get some calls on how.  Fall back on it.  Let's get some.  You know what?  Let's take some calls on.  How much time do we have?  Like less than two minutes.  Less than two minutes?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get some reviews.  A quick review.  Only positive ones, though.  We don't have any reviews on the line right now.  Let's go to another comedy question.  Spike.  Spike from Chicago.  What's happening?  Yeah.  I have people tell me all the time that I'm funny.  And, you know, I've thought about being a comedian.  I don't think so.  I think they're wrong.  Well, how do you know when to take the step? 
[02:38:00]  What's a good sign?  When your uncle walks out of the room cleaning off his cock.  Oh, that other guy's going to call you.  That is not a reason to start stand-up.  My uncle did it every night.  I am not a comedian.  I don't know.  I guess comedy is really hard, so you have to really be driven to do it.  You've got to love Comic Con.  It's really one of the only jobs where you have to learn in front of people.  You have to humiliate yourself pretty regularly.  I mean, you're into that.  Nathan, what's your opinion real quick as a new comic? 
[02:38:30]  You're going to tell me to shut up, aren't you?  No, but here's the thing.  Go to Amazon.com.  Get my DVD.  Don't go fuck yourselves.  Still got 25 seconds.  Oh, we still got 25 seconds?  I think it was that dead air I was talking about.  Let's take another call.  I think this was a lot of fun.  I want to do this some more.  We'll get better at it.  I think we were perfect the first time.  It's like we know each other. 
[02:39:00]  Now wrap it up.  Okay, good night.  Thank you, everyone.  You're finished with this shit.  All done.  All right.  Hey, this is Jon Bon Jovi, and you're listening to me and Opie and Anthony right here on the  worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let the show die, then.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:39:30]  They should be shot.  Really fast.  Anthony had a neighbor moment.  Yeah, it was just quick.  I love my suburban neighborhood.  We like going into Anthony's neighborhood every once in a while, because if you know anything  about Anthony, and now there's people in Pittsburgh and West Palm Beach, they don't really know  us yet.  No.  But we're being heard finally back in Philly and Boston and other places where they know  a lot about us.  The people in Boston and Worcester, they kind of know where I came from. 
[02:40:00]  Really?  I lived in Ashland, Mass.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I lived in Ashland, Mass.  Nuff said.  I lived in a housing complex amongst the Brazilians, where they were actually, they had chickens  on their patios.  And yeah, so I finally decided very recently to grow up.  And by very recently, I mean three months ago or so.  And I decided to make my first ever house purchase. 
[02:40:30]  And I moved to a neighborhood that is full, chock full of Jews.  Because, and I'm a Catholic, Roman Catholic guy.  But I just love the Jews in the neighborhood.  Because the lawns are perfectly kept by Mexican landscapers.  They, uh, they're nice.  You know, they give a little wave, howdy neighbor.  They all own nice cars and everything.  That's what I, just a nice suburban neighborhood.  That's what I like.  And you know, I've made contact with the next door neighbor a little bit. 
[02:41:00]  And there's kind of some scuttlebutt around the neighborhood about me.  And I guess they're talking amongst themselves, uh, if it's a good thing that I live there.  They give a little gossip, which is just part of suburbia.  They're going to be all gossipy, you know.  But no harm done.  It's not like living in the city where a pizza delivery guy, uh, comes to your house  and gets shot in the face and robbed.  That's, that, or there's roaches. 
[02:41:30]  Ugh.  It's just weird because you don't want to, uh, communicate with anybody, really.  Let's be honest.  No, that's the hardest part.  I'm very, uh, psychopathic.  And we get these updates from kind of time.  You've had the neighbors come over with, like, uh, baked goods.  Baked goods is very nice of them.  You didn't even know if you should invite them in or not.  I don't know the protocol.  You're just taking their baked goods at the front door and pretty much slamming the door in their face.  All right, come on, come on, come on, come on.  But finally you invited them in for a quick moment.  No, never invited them in.  Oh, I thought you did.  No?  No, one time they were going to a movie when we did invite them in and told them we have nothing here. 
[02:42:00]  I mean, we just moved in.  And then after a while they gave us some more time, came over with some baked goods.  And, uh, I guess we were supposed to invite them in and make some coffee and then share the baked goods.  But we kind of just grabbed the baked goods, shut the door, and that was it.  With the chain still on the lock.  And then we are at the chain.  Hello, what do you want?  Yeah, they're just squishing the muffins through the little space that you allow.  Not even open the door.  Through the intercom.  Hello, what do you want?  Hi, it's your neighbors.  Whatever you got, leave it on the, uh, mat and go away. 
[02:42:30]  And let me see your hands.  Let me see your hands as you back away from the door.  I'm not a very social person.  And throughout my life, in my living circumstances, I don't know how to socialize.  I just have a great visual of them with a, I'll call it a bunt cake.  It wasn't a bunt cake.  And you only give them like two inches, so they're just shoving the cake through that.  But, Brink, cut it, cut it into slivers and slide it under the door.  You think one of them was ever walking their door at like nine at night, and it's all dark 
[02:43:00]  outside, so the light in your apartment is illuminated at your house, and they look through  the crack and they just see you in that Nazi jacket marching around your living room talking  to yourself.  In your underpants, you're just wearing the top half of the uniform.  Look, I hope, I certainly hope no one, I don't wear a Nazi uniform around the house.  I don't own a Nazi uniform.  He only waits for the full moon.  I am a fan.  So he doesn't have to turn his lights on so people aren't on to him.  I am a fan of the 40s and the war era.  Black socks halfway up his thighs. 
[02:43:30]  I own a British Enfield rifle.  It was a Nazi killer.  I don't own Nazi paraphernalia.  We're trying to envision what you look like.  I'm thinking black socks halfway up his calves, his underpants, not boxer briefs, but underpants  tightly cropped.  With the socks, he has the little thing that holds them on to his calves.  And then only the top half of the uniform.  And he's on the porch with a broomstick like it's a rifle, and he's just holding them.  I know.  And they walk by and they go, Anthony?  I don't.  They were such snappy dressers, weren't they? 
[02:44:00]  Snappy.  Well, come on.  Now, they were.  You gotta give them that.  I did have a little bit of a frightening moment there last night.  Yeah, what happened?  Well, I was alone last night.  My girlfriend went out shopping, and I'm alone in the house.  So I'm just kind of laying in bed.  Why am I alone?  Why am I alone?  I'm watching TV, and I hear a door open.  I hear a little creak like a, and I look at the alarm and I realize, oh my God, I hadn't 
[02:44:30]  set the alarm.  Now, I tripped up.  I didn't set the alarm, and I hear a door, distinctly hear a creak of a door opening.  And it's very loud.  So I know it's not the TV.  It's not some neighbor thing.  Please tell me you almost shot an innocent victim.  Dude, I go right for the gauge.  Right for the 12.  I put on my jammy pants, and now I realize I still have no curtains up. 
[02:45:00]  So if anybody's looking at the house, they're looking at a lunatic in his pajama bottoms  toting a 12-gauge down his stairs, yelling, you best come out, mother effer, or you're  dead.  You do know this was all in your mind, right?  No, no, no.  It was a creaking door.  There was.  It was a creaking door.  Sure it was, Anthony.  Sure it was.  So I'm sneaking around the house with the shotgun, like, you know, checking the basement or 
[02:45:30]  anywhere else.  Maybe they, you know, came in through a basement window and opened the basement door somehow.  You know, I'm just kind of, you know, going over everything, checking every corner of the  house.  You're not kind of just checking anything when you have a shotgun.  Well, yes, I was prepared to kill somebody if I would have seen them in there, and they  perhaps weren't white.  Look, I'm kidding.  Now, stop it. 
[02:46:00]  Inappropriate.  I'm kidding, of course, if they did not belong there.  Can I jump in for one second?  Craig, go ahead.  O.P.  Craig.  What's going on?  Hello?  We still have to do this.  Craig.  Yeah.  All right, what's up?  You're starting to worry me, man.  Why?  Well, you know, you're holding hands with Danny at the Mets game, and this morning night  you're picturing Anthony walking through his house, black socks and underwear?  Well, because we think he's nuts.  Yeah, everyone thinks I'm crazy.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  But the phone's still not.  I'm really not.  And I checked the house while toting my 12-gauge, and it was clear.  So I gave myself the all-clear.  All-clear.  All-clear.  And went upstairs, and as I'm walking back up the stairs-  Please tell me someone scared you, and you shot a hole in your ceiling.  No, you would have loved that, wouldn't you?  I would have loved it.  The fireplace.  Also, his girlfriend comes in. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, Anthony.  Ah!  Bam!  No, no, no.  Big, huge hole in the ceiling.  And here's the thing.  I had just called my girlfriend, and she was having dinner, so I knew that she wasn't the  one that was coming home.  So I knew everything, you know, if someone's coming through my door, they don't belong in  the house.  And I'm not a shoot-first kind of guy.  Might take out a kneecap, but, you know, I'm not going to kill the guy right away.  I'll wait, and call some hard pipe-hitting niggas. 
[02:47:30]  Come over with a blowtorch and a pair of pliers.  I walk up with the shotgun over my shoulder, because now the house is clear, so I could just  kind of walk upstairs.  And I hear the door.  It's my girlfriend's computer.  It has a sound prompt when she gets an email.  That makes the sound of a creaking door opening and closing.  And that is what I was hunting down in my house last night. 
[02:48:00]  Please tell me you blew away the computer.  I turned and fired.  What did he look like?  I need a new Dell monitor.  He was a little yellow man, and whenever the American Online came on, he would run quickly  across my screen.  He had no hands or feet.  It was a little dog, and he wanted to answer my questions with a paperclip.  It was a tough shot, but I finally got him.  The talking paperclip upset me, and I had to shoot.  You know what's going to happen?  One day he's going to get broken into, and he's going to point the gun, and they're going 
[02:48:30]  to walk up and go, give me that gun.  And he's going to go, stay back!  Stay back!  And they're going to walk up and just take it from him.  No, I will shoot to kill.  I'm protecting me and my own.  I, you know, I'm protecting my house.  So you realize what it was, and you just kind of returned to your post.  Yeah, I returned to my post back on my patio.  No, I put the 12 back.  I hadn't even racked it yet.  It wasn't even around in the chamber.  I was waiting.  That's a dramatic moment.  Whoosh!  Whoosh! 
[02:49:00]  Nice!  Scares everybody away.  But that was after I had my neighborly moment.  Young lad, as I pulled up in the driveway, bouncing a basketball down the street.  This is a lovely suburban neighborhood I live in.  Doink, doink, he's just bouncing a basketball.  And I get out of my vehicle, and he goes, you're Anthony.  He was about 10 or 11 or something like that.  I go, yeah.  Yeah, hi.  And he just keeps going.  I go, what's your name?  He goes, Billy, I live over there. 
[02:49:30]  Doink, doink.  I go, well, it's nice to meet you, Billy.  Yeah, nice to meet you.  Doink, doink, doink.  Down there.  And I'm just thinking, what a wonderful neighborhood this is, where you could just see scenes of  suburbia like that.  No problem of, no threats of being robbed, except by a computer making noises.  Well, speaking of which, on the instant feedback, inbred pest from a website you can't mention. 
[02:50:00]  She should make a sound prompt that says, what are you doing?  So Ann can say, I don't know.  Can you help me?  If I were her, now I'd really do it.  Her next sound prompt should be, every time someone walks in, she'd be like, all right,  you checked the other room for 20 minutes, you're running downstairs with your gun cocked.  Just wearing underpants.  My underpants.  No, I had to put, like, and here's what happened.  I knew the sound came from outside the bedroom. 
[02:50:30]  So I could see from my bedroom, I could see down my hallway and to the staircase, the top  of the staircase.  So if anyone's coming in, I know they have to be downstairs, and if they're going to threaten  me at that point, they have to come up the stairs.  So I'm putting my pajama bottoms on with a deadlock stare at the top of the stairway.  Like, because I don't want to take my eyes off of it, just in case, you know, they rush  me.  But I don't want to be caught without my pants on. 
[02:51:00]  You don't want to be found.  I don't want to be killed or kill someone without my pants on, because that's embarrassing  either way.  Because then you can't kill someone and put your pants on, because then it's like, you  know, I don't know, perhaps there was some splatter on your leg, and they would be doing  something where you're screwing around with evidence or things.  So, but I don't want to shoot someone naked or in my underwear.  All right, let's go to Greg in Westchester.  Greg.  Am I making sense, Jimmy?  You're looking at me like I'm a psychopath.  No, you're not.  It's perfectly normal to have them put your pants on before you murder somebody. 
[02:51:30]  It's not murder if they're in my house.  It's self-defense, my friend.  How much of a bag can be distracting.  Self-defense.  Greg, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning, boys.  Great show.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  You searching through the house looking for that rascally wabbit?  No, I wasn't hunting for a cartoon wabbit, you idiot.  Ah, what's up, Doc?  There's some great phone calls coming in, but we're having a problem with the phones today,  unfortunately.  Why can't I just protect my castle? 
[02:52:00]  It's a man protecting his castle.  That's what it is.  You guys, you're a bunch of faggots.  You're going to sit.  You know what's going to happen someday?  Jimmy's going to order out or something or order one of these whores, and he's going to  get the thing, and the whore will go, hi, it's a whore, and the door will open, and five  guys are going to come barging in, and they're going to sit there, and as you're duct taped  down, you're going to see them slip her a couple of bucks for getting them in the door, and 
[02:52:30]  then you will be raped, uh, uh, raped again.  Um, that'll happen all night.  And then I'm going to be like, man, because I'm like, oh, there's no way they're not going  to charge me extra for this.  The, uh, the Dominican gang attacking you.  There's no way that comes cheap.  Straighten out the white boy fantasy.  By the way.  You think I just open my door?  Hi, whore.  Oh, my goodness.  Five men. 
[02:53:00]  What do you do?  Look out your peephole?  I have, I have security in my building.  You think, and they tell me who's coming up.  Oh, so, okay, that's good, that's good.  Uh, uh, base your whole livelihood in your life on some doorman.  The guys that you hate in every building you're in.  No, there's a lot of dumb doorman, uh, doorman in, uh, Manhattan, but Jimmy's got the real  thing.  All out security.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Cameras.  Yeah, all sorts of things.  All the building.  By the way, uh, instant feedback coming in from the mobile phones, that does work, because 
[02:53:30]  someone actually sent an instant feedback going, hey, does this work?  Because I'm sending from my, uh, mobile device.  Yes, it does work.  Uh, this one comes from 781.  But it says, uh, Anthony, you won't shoot to kill.  You'll burst into tears, you sally.  No, in the old days, I may have.  A little callback from yesterday's crying segment.  We're too honest on this program.  That's the problem.  Protect your castle, huh, Ant?  How many wives have you beheaded?  I don't be head wives. 
[02:54:00]  Chip in Saratoga.  Anthony, you're watching too many effing Abbott and Costello meet the monsters movies.  Oh, like, no, like, there's never been home invasions in Nassau County, uh, New York, my  friend.  There are.  There's been plenty of home invasions.  Anthony refers to his house as a castle, but it seems more like his bunker.  Brian from Florida.  House, bunker, whatever you want to call it.  When that lad came up and said, hi, you're Anthony, you had those visions of popping out 
[02:54:30]  of the bunker and seeing the young Germans defending the turf.  You felt, you know what I did?  I walked up to him.  I patted him on the cheek and I said, I wish I had a whole battalion like you.  Looks like you needed Danny over at your castle last night to hold your hand.  To hold my hand.  That was damn funny.  If Danny comes into my neighborhood, he's getting shot.  No, he's not.  He's, he's part Jew.  Yeah, but the other, but yeah, okay.  Yeah, he might fit.  All right.  Uh, that's very funny.  If someone just kind of flip me through the radio and they hear that, no, he's part Jew. 
[02:55:00]  Ah, ah, part Jew.  What are you going to do?  Jew, bro.  It didn't look like a scene out of American History X when I had my shirt off.  I don't have any tattoos.  Put the computer monitor on the curb and steps on it.  You're an ass.  An armed ass.  Home invasions are a serious matter.  That's why your local law enforcement decided to put this video together.  Home security strategies with Anthony Cumia will instruct you on how to protect your loved ones 
[02:55:30]  and more importantly, your valuables.  This week's episode is defending a single point entry.  Your best defense is having a situation where they all have to come through one place.  You ever see the 300?  If you've got a home invasion and they've got to come through a door or a window,  you've got to keep stuff secure enough where it's going to take them a little while to get in.  And then when you hear that commotion, grab your weaponry. 
[02:56:00]  Take up a position.  That door flies open.  Bam, they're all right in your sights.  We hope you've learned a lot from today's video.  For more information on home invasions or other videos, contact your local police department.  Hey, this is David Duchovny.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What the f*** was that? 
[02:56:30]  Go F yourself.  Wean every day.  Go F yourself.  Wean every day.  Wean every day.  I'll beat up a check for you.  What?  You're not gonna do it.  You're not gonna do it.  You're not gonna do it. 
[02:57:00]  Okay, watch this.  Get out of here, twat.  Stupid friggin' twat.  This is a turn-off.  Go for a tote.  Let me just show you how serious I am.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  Get in the coffin.  Howdy, maggot.  You son of a bitch.  Why, I just did it right.  Yo, motherfuckers.  This is Drew Boogie.  You just heard one of my remixes. 
[02:57:30]  And check me out on MySpace.  MySpace.com slash thegreatdrewboogie.  That's not me.  Opie said that.  And he said that about everybody.  And I'm too tired for this shit.
