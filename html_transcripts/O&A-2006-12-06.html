<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton recovering from a road trip, filled with complaints about air travel, including inconsiderate passengers and the infamous flatulence incident resulting in a bomb scare.  They joked about the perks of first-class versus the woes of coach travel, segued into a listener marshmallow-eating contest ("Chubby Bunny"), recalling a death related to the contest, and then launched into a discussion about crying.  This included personal anecdotes, audio clips of crying celebrities (like George H.W. Bush), and listener calls detailing their own tear-inducing moments, including emotional responses to *Little People, Big World* and news events.  A listener criticized their on-air dynamic, prompting a humorous story about one host crying in front of his girlfriend.  The segment promoted "Whip Him Out Wednesday," the "boob index," a planned homeless shopping spree, and the Chubby Bunny contest.  An awkward moment arose from a general manager's inappropriate request for more explicit content.

The "Crying Hall of Fame" segment followed, beginning with memories of a post-9/11 U2 concert.  This led to clips of a child crying after a BB gun incident, Richard Simmons crying over Michael Hebranko's weight, George H.W. Bush’s emotional speech, and a man caught faking retardation.  The hosts then bashed the New York Yankees, transitioning to Sam, a studio guest, whose mother won a Chubby Bunny contest. This sparked a discussion about race and Sam’s appearance.  Clips of Mike Woods, a struggling local weatherman, were played, followed by calls from Chris (who prefers larger men) and another caller describing a vivid sexual experience.  Brother Weez’s upcoming show was promoted.  A Chubby Bunny contest between E-Rock and staff ensued, complete with betting.  Negative commentary about Sylvester Stallone's films (Rocky and the upcoming "Pearl of the Cobra") preceded a discussion about a hoax involving a McDonald's employee being coerced into sexual assault.  The segment ended with more Chubby Bunny speculation and guesses about a GM's identity.

The next segment started with more Chubby Bunny, featuring Roland and Craig's attempts (with Craig reaching 17 marshmallows and being asked to say obscenities), and a caller's tragic story about a child choking on a marshmallow.  The focus dramatically shifted to a hoax video where a caller impersonated a police officer, directing a McDonald's manager to sexually assault an employee.  The hosts reacted with disbelief and amusement, commenting extensively on the video's details.  The segment concluded with a discussion of competitive eater Pat from Minaki, banned after vomiting eggnog on an intern, and a panel report that deemed the ban hasty.  The hosts ended with banter about their schedules and upcoming segments, including the homeless shopping spree.

The show then announced Pat Philbin's reinstatement (with a censure) to the IFOC-y, followed by criticism of a poorly-received Wow Stickers ad involving a raccoon biting a host's testicles.  Listener calls dominated a countdown of the "top ten most annoying pop songs of 2006," featuring angry, profane, and often offensive commentary about James Blunt, Beyoncé, Bo Bice, Fergie, and others.  Racist remarks by Craig and a listener's unrepeatable anecdote added to the offensive tone.  Fergie's "London Bridge" and Ne-Yo's "When You're Mad" were analyzed for sexual content, with more vulgar commentary and listener calls.  Mentions of a "Baby Bird" video and an Iron Man/Nissan ad punctuated the segment, concluding with a bit on Sting and a lute.

The final segment began with a bizarre debate about cricket wings, escalating into insults aimed at a caller. A listener inquired about a lubricant recommended by Jimmy Norton, leading to a discussion of various brands. An animated Uncle Paul video with sexual content on OpenAnthony.com was discussed, followed by a listener pointing out a Jimmy Norton HBO commercial.  The main focus turned to the backlash from a prank on an elderly woman's sex blog.  The hosts read inflammatory and apologetic comments, discussing a possible on-air apology and guest appearance.  Further vulgar listener comments were read, followed by promotion of Jim Norton's New Year's Eve show, Opie's Pal Talk appearance, a Ron & Fez announcement, the "Line of the Day" (with highly offensive language), and Brother Weez's Saturday Night Virus show.  Numerous listener calls contributed to the overall chaotic and offensive tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Ovi, Anthony and James Norton.  So, here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with pure rage and then eventually everything just stops. 
[00:00:30]  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fest.  Who cares about the funny? Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he.  Ovi.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance. 
[00:01:00]  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Ovi and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A.  And.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Hey.  One last stretch.  And then we broadcast.  Thank you already.  People on Pal Talk saying, guess no plane crash, huh?  Like they're welcoming us back like that.  That's a fine how do you do.  I guess that plane didn't go down.  No, we're here.  Well, it's good to be home.  That's for sure.  We were just talking about that just before we turned the mics on. 
[00:02:00]  The road is the road.  But I don't know.  It's just good to be back in the studio here in New York City.  Hate the road.  It's the Ovi and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America and spreading through Anthony's body and spreading through Jim Norton's body.  So sick.  So sick.  Woke up this morning at the hotel and just went to went to swallow.  And I don't know what's going on.  It was like a pin cushion, a snotty pin cushion trying to swallow it. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, scratchy.  I'm all stuffed.  You're going to be fine by tomorrow.  It's got to be the change of weather crack.  It was happening yesterday during our wonderful commute from the airport back to the city.  Yeah.  I had it.  An hour and a half.  Eric had it.  Eric was sick.  We're all a bit sick.  Yeah.  Yeah, we were all just in a van with each other.  That was only a few hours ago, wasn't it?  It's the van, the plane with the filthy people, sick people hacking, hacking into their hands and then touching everything. 
[00:03:00]  Sometimes you want that plane to just go down.  Just burn all the germs in the fire of jet fuel.  Well, we had delays down in West Palm Beach and then we flew into Newark after doing some loopy loops and circles around Manhattan.  And then for some reason, I guess the rest of the country is not going to care. 
[00:03:30]  But, you know, when you drive into New York City during rush hour, you would think it would be clear sailing because everyone's trying to leave New York City.  They leave.  Rush hour is everyone working in New York leaving to their suburban home.  Well, for some reason, like, trying to get into New York during rush hour is just as bad.  I just don't get that.  Who are those people and where are they going?  Who are those people?  Not everyone's coming back from flights.  So who are all these people?  Well, the tree is up now.  So they're going to look at the stupid tree.  Oh, you know what?  Good boy.  I don't know if it's lit yet, but it's the holidays. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, it's lit.  I curse that tree.  That's why we had all that crazy traffic, you know, close to your hotel and such.  Because, yeah, it's just bottleneckers all over the place.  Stupid tree.  It is a stupid tree.  I'm going to try to commission 80 more tunnels coming into the city.  That's all you need.  You think they could do that?  That's all you need is a couple more anyway.  80.  I was talking last night that I wanted to build a huge, giant platform over Manhattan.  Just a flat table that is as high as the highest building is right now and build an airport on it with elevators. 
[00:04:30]  So you land, you hop in an elevator, and you go down to New York City.  How great would that be?  Why not?  Why not?  It's 2006.  Look, I got 20 bucks to get the whole thing rolling.  Come on.  Dude, that is a great idea.  It's a giant platform over the city.  Why do we have to always stick with the technology we've been doing for, you know, whatever, for forever?  Let's just say forever. 
[00:05:00]  It's time to update.  That is a brilliant idea.  Imagine the plane lands.  You hop in an elevator.  You take, like, a tram up there to what would amount to your over downtown.  Right.  And then you take an elevator, and it drops you right in downtown.  Even if it's a long elevator, who cares?  Yeah, whatever.  It's got to be a long one.  It's got to be as high as, you know, the highest building around.  But knowing human nature, the elevator would have huge delays.  Yeah, big delays at the elevator.  Because some dope couldn't figure out how to, like, push L for lobby. 
[00:05:30]  Lobby.  C for city.  Hey, you're thinking, though, man.  Oh, I'm always thinking.  I like that.  It would be too shadowy and cloudy under the airport.  We don't care.  I know, but nobody would live there.  You know something?  Screw it.  How often is it really nice and sunny and people care in the city?  This is a place of work.  This whole city is your workplace.  Well, you just sacrifice part of your city, and then that's the part of the city that will never see sun again?  That's it.  Cut a big hole out over Central Park, okay? 
[00:06:00]  Are you kidding?  I mean, right here in Midtown, during the day, you know, there's shadows and shade.  There are people that have apartments in Midtown especially that never see the sun.  They just never see the sun.  Put airports on their roofs.  Because buildings, what I say, buildings just pretty much block the sunlight.  All right.  Well, speaking of flying, so, yeah, it was a long commute home yesterday.  A really long commute.  And I'm jealous of Anthony.  I got to tell you, man.  Oh.  Man, all of a sudden, we get to Newark after, I don't know, like a three-hour flight. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And we get off the plane, and it's like, man, that's like a transporter.  It was like a transporter for me.  Like, what are you talking about?  Like Star Trek.  You fell asleep before we took off.  Yep.  And you woke up when the plane hit the runway.  Pretty much when the pilot said, flight crew, prepare for landing.  You know, like that was it.  So I was like, wow.  I shut my eyes, opened them, I was there.  It was like I was beamed from Florida to New York. 
[00:07:00]  And you don't take anything to relax you for flying or anything, do you?  Nah, I had a Bloody Mary before the plane even, you know, was loaded.  Yeah.  I like sitting in first class with a Bloody Mary as people walk by me and go, how is he getting a drink?  And I go, because I'm important.  I just feel a little guilty when I'm in first class.  Oh, forget about it.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I'm not used to this crap.  I look through the SkyMall magazine and circle everything in front of people.  So I'm getting this and this and this and I need this massager that could be used for other things. 
[00:07:30]  I love the people as they're walking by, they look at you and they give you that smile like, why are you in first class and I'm not?  This old bag, this old bat walked by and she went to shove her luggage into the overhead bin over our seats.  Uh-oh.  Yes, but she was not in first class.  She was a coach person.  So the stew, the sexy stew came over and told her, excuse me, miss, you have to find an overhead bin in your cabin. 
[00:08:00]  They don't say, you know, coach or anything.  They just say in your cabin.  And she goes, a space is a space.  What's the difference?  And I was thinking, a space is a space.  You might as well say that about the luxurious seats.  Yep.  You're in first class.  A space is a space.  But you ain't sitting here, lady.  Now move it.  Take your bag of crap and get into coach with Kenny. 
[00:08:30]  They should put curtains up along the aisle where the people sit so we don't have to make eye contact and be forced to share smiling pleasantries with people in the back of the aircraft.  Don't want to look at it.  I don't want to look at them.  Don't ruin my mood with your dirty coachness.  And you know what gets me also?  So how quickly I can get my crap into that overhead bin without interrupting anyone behind me. 
[00:09:00]  Woof, you lift it up.  It's in.  You're done.  I'm in my seat.  Time.  I'm like a rodeo guy.  Time.  Isn't that because you're actually aware of people around you?  That there are people behind me trying to get on this aircraft.  Well, that's the biggest problem in this world in general, that there are a bunch of dummies out there that aren't aware there are other people around them that they're affecting with their stupidity.  Dude, there are people.  Whether it's driving or getting on an airplane.  In the middle of the aisle, unpacking their carry-on, getting their headphones out, getting whatever electronics they need, a book, anything. 
[00:09:30]  What they could have done outside before they got on the plane, taking all that crap out and held onto it in one hand, wheel their bag on in the other, so the bag can go right into overhead and they can sit the F down and get out of everybody's way.  But, no, they've got to sit there and not even look behind them, that everyone's standing there going, and that's why it takes so long for these idiots to get on the plane. 
[00:10:00]  They're unaware or they just don't care.  They just think they're the most important person in the world or in the country, whatever.  And have you ever, ever had to answer your cell phone like, yeah, we're on the plane, still on the runway.  Hey, we're ready to take off, should be shortly.  Well, that happens on the trains when you're commuting.  That's the same, we're on the same subject here.  Talk at a normal volume into your phone, retards. 
[00:10:30]  What is that about when you're commuting?  You know, back to Long Island especially when I used to do the commute and these people would get on their cell phones and talk really loud.  Is it they don't give a crap about others?  Yeah.  Or, I mean, what goes through their head?  Or they're not aware?  So self-important that they believe everybody wants to hear what their conversation is.  That's all I can conjure up in my head.  I think they just don't care that people can hear them. 
[00:11:00]  They're unaware because they're self-centered.  Like, someone calls me and I'm on a train or a plane, I'm like, yeah, I cut my hand over there.  I get all like, oh my God.  And it's just a fact.  I know I'm annoying everybody.  And even when I'm like, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I love you too, but listen, man.  Yeah.  You know, I gotta go.  I just gotta go.  I'll call you when I get off the train.  We just landed.  I'm going to go to the baggage.  And then I'll call you from the transportation.  Okay.  Like, I go so the other way with that. 
[00:11:30]  There are people, you know, yeah, well, we closed the deal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We talked.  No, that meeting went for about five hours or so.  It was pretty good, though.  I got them.  We closed that deal.  Going to be very happy with the results that I got here.  Shut up.  Quiet.  So anyway, we get to Newark.  We all get off the plane.  I hate people.  I just hate people.  Yeah, they're awful.  They made me sick.  Just to go back to the thing.  So we get off the plane in Newark, and there's Anthony. 
[00:12:00]  We're all gathering.  And I look at you, and you're like, I have no idea where you just flew.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  So you woke up when the plane hit the runway, and that was it.  Burp.  That's amazing.  Burp.  That was when I was awake.  Burp.  Burp.  I'm such a ridiculously light sleeper that I think I got 10 minutes in.  And we did the show and everything.  So, you know, it's nap time for us.  Exhaustorated.  I needed sleep.  You would think you could just, you know, sleep an hour or two on the plane. 
[00:12:30]  You know, just while people are boarding the plane, I thought I could get a few minutes in.  I just can't.  It was after our – because I was shot anyway after the show, and then our near catastrophe at the airport,  where they had me booked on a flight that was an hour after the flight that I was booked on.  Right.  And then Jimmy's flight was the next day.  And I already checked in online.  He checked in online, and he looks at his ticket and goes, wait a minute.  This is for tomorrow.  And mine was for a completely different plane an hour later, and my bag was already on its way to that plane. 
[00:13:00]  So Kenny, like, chases after it with a baggage guy and comes back and goes,  Anthony, I physically saw them take your bag and put it on the proper plane.  And Jimmy had to give them crap about it.  Oh, you physically saw it?  You didn't theoretically see it, idiot?  Or emotionally, you saw your heart?  Emotionally.  Metaphysically.  I emotionally saw it.  Yeah, well, that's wonderful. 
[00:13:30]  All right.  Hey, speaking of planes, flatulence, not turbulence, forces plane landing in Nashville.  Yeah, a little gas problem.  Another, uh, I don't mean, fuel.  Yeah, left, right.  All right.  Yeah, just another dummy on a flight.  Flatulence brought 99 passengers on an American Airlines flight to an unscheduled visit to Nashville early Monday morning.  American flight 1053 from Washington to Dallas made an emergency landing. 
[00:14:00]  Hereafter, passengers reported smelling struck matches.  Uh, matches, excuse me.  Said, Lynn, Lawrence, a spokeswoman for blah, blah, blah.  Okay, the plane landed safely, blah, blah, blah.  The passengers and five crew members were brought off the plane together with all the luggage?  Yeah, because you smell some kind of a match.  Sulfur smell.  They're thinking bomb.  They're thinking some kind of bomb went off.  Some lady's farts.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Some lady cut a gasser and, uh, that idiot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the crew and the passengers and the luggage had to, uh, you know, get off the plane.  Uh, they had to go through security checks again.  Yep.  Bomb sniffing dogs found spent matcheses.  Uh, match.  Why can't, why do I keep saying matcheses?  Matcheses.  Uh, spent matches.  The FBI questioned a passenger who admitted she struck the matches in an attempt to conceal body odor.  Yes, a fart. 
[00:15:00]  Yep.  Uh, the flight took off again, but the woman was not allowed back on the plane.  Good dummy.  The American has banned her for a long time.  What?  First of all, why not just fess up that you did that before they drag everyone off with their luggage?  Again, self-important.  You know, just say, yeah, I blasted one out.  Look.  I had a lighter match.  Look, I just agreed with the self-importance thing.  Yeah.  Um, who's going to admit that? 
[00:15:30]  People would, people would want to kill.  That you blasted one?  People would want to kill you.  Admit it to the, like, like, whisper to, like, while you're still in the air.  Say, yeah, I lit a match.  Go.  You know what it is?  If you blast one on a plane, who's going to know it was you?  All right, the cabin gets all, you know, but who's going to know it's you?  You start lighting matches?  Now there's a problem.  I think, I think if the plane has to, like, uh, go somewhere else because of you, there's no way out of it. 
[00:16:00]  The passengers will literally want to kill you.  Yeah.  Or at least, uh, do some serious harm to your body.  Oof.  Me and Florentino on a flight one time, we both got upgraded.  This is, uh, our coach got upgraded to first, which is the best when you misbehave when you've been upgraded.  And I can't tell you how much gas I had.  It's embarrassing.  And it was horrid.  It was so bad that Jim had went to the restroom, and I'm in my seat, and the, it was me dropping bombs, but the lady thought it was him. 
[00:16:30]  So the flight attendant took a little spritzer, and it was like, outside the men's room door.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  And then Stupid comes out, and we're flying, and I kept dropping him.  And there was one point where a flight attendant was walking through, and he stopped, doubled back, got the spritzer again, and did it right next to my seat in the aisle.  And all you see is my newspaper and Jim's newspaper shaking because we're both laughing hysterically, and why not? 
[00:17:00]  Oh, is that good?  It was great.  We got Tennessee checking in.  Brian, what's up?  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  Glad you guys made it back safely.  I want to know is how did this dumb broad get matches on the plane?  You're allowed matches.  Yeah, this is what's messed up.  It ends the story.  While it is legal to bring as many as four books of paper safety matches.  Yeah.  Why is that legal?  Little books of matches.  You're allowed to bring them. 
[00:17:30]  For what reason?  I don't know.  So you can light up your cigarette right when you get out of the plane.  As soon as you land, you can go and get your stupid matches or lighter.  That sounds a little unsafe.  Yeah.  Do we have matches?  So you're allowed to, yeah, you're allowed as many as four books of matches.  And why would you need four books of matches on a plane?  That just seems like something that needs to be changed.  One book.  But of course it's illegal to strike a match.  Yeah, you can't strike a match.  Dude, it's not like, you know, matchbooks are a rare item. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, you can see what's going on.  You know, ban stupid matchbooks, please.  My girlfriend had to check all her luggage because of that stupid ban on liquids.  Oh, yeah, gels and liquids.  And she forgot to put her stuff in my bag, like the makeup and all that stuff.  So we had to go back and check it.  Yeah.  So irritating.  Just stop certain people from flying, please.  Yeah.  Yeah, like your chick is one that you should worry about.  She should be profiled.  Stop.  All right.  Well, we're back in New York City. 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  We're very happy to be back today on the show.  Happy to be here.  We got, it's not the Chubby Bunny contest.  We're trying it out on the air.  Yeah, this is an experiment.  Yeah, we've learned through one of our listeners, they had a contest at a county fair where a  lady died doing the Chubby Bunny contest.  Choked to death right there.  Yeah, the first in the history of the Chubby Bunny contest.  And basically, it's where I would assume, I was going to assume fat girls, but I guess 
[00:19:00]  it's any girl could do it.  Girls like to put a marshmallow in their mouth, and then they say, Chubby Bunny.  And then they put another marshmallow in their mouth and say, Chubby Bunny.  And then they put another marshmallow in their mouth and say, Chubby Bunny.  And then after a while, after a while, your mouth is so full of marshmallows, you can't  say it, and you lose.  And you're out.  Right.  So we're going to have a little bet with E-Rock.  You want to bet today, Ant?  How many marshmallows? 
[00:19:30]  You're a betting man.  Sure.  Jimmy, you want to bet?  I don't like to gamble.  I don't condone it.  I'll wager.  A little bit.  Yeah, we'll get some wagers going.  I would suggest you do some wagering at home as well.  How many marshmallows can E-Rock stuff into that fat face of his without choking?  Well, he's got chubby cheeks.  Yeah, a little chipmunk-like.  He's not a fat man.  No, not at all.  He's got chubby cheeks.  He's odd because he looks like he could be fat. 
[00:20:00]  But then when you look at him, he's like, oh, no, his face is not fat.  His body's not fat.  There you go.  And yet when you look at him, you just see fat.  Wow.  Also, we got the former president breaking down and crying.  Oh, this is so bad.  We love crying audio on the Opie and Anthony show.  George Bush Sr.  Yeah, can we do that next?  Losing it, please.  Yeah, we love it.  Can we show a picture of his wife?  And E-Rock, can you go to the Crying Hall of Fame and get us some examples of other crying  clips that we know and love? 
[00:20:30]  We love the weeping celebrities.  That's right.  All right.  We got to talk about E. coli.  We got to talk about trans fats.  Trans fats.  That just boggles my mind.  We can get into that.  Oh, and look, Mike Woods.  How I missed him.  Oh, do we have his audio from earlier?  I hope so.  All right.  We're getting that.  Pulled quite the gaffe right when we get back.  I'm watching and just, oh, he's typical Mike Woods.  Weatherman here in New York, by the way, and he just stinks at improv.  His improv skills are horrid. 
[00:21:00]  And I guess we'll talk about the split of Jennifer Aniston and Vince Flaunch.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Splitsville.  Well, you know, it's water cooler talk today.  Everyone's going to be discussing what happened.  Yeah.  What's that?  Oh, they're discussing how serious satellite radio is tanking.  There's hoo-hoo Howie.  Yeah, that was a good deal for the company.  Ooh.  He moved the stock a whole quarter in the last year.  That's got to hurt.  That's terrific.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whip him out Wednesday. 
[00:21:30]  Let's give it the big plug here.  Right.  Get a wow on the vehicle.  For detailed instructions on how to get your very own wow sticker, visit opieandanthony.com.  Wow stands for whip him out Wednesday.  We pretty much say at this point, whip him out whenever.  It's going to be whip him out any time, but that's wow.  It works great when you're stuck in traffic going to a sporting event.  Wow.  One of these days you'd be driving.  A girl that's familiar with the program is going to see the wow, know what it means, pull  up next to you, and flash you.  It makes that commute so much better.  So there you have it.  Whip him out Wednesday. 
[00:22:00]  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, it's whip him out Wednesday.  Oh, it is.  What's the track of the days?  Well, we love doing a national talk show because they're whipping him out somewhere. 
[00:22:30]  New York is a little cold right now.  I don't know if it's going to be a great day for whipping him out Wednesday in the New York  City area.  I doubt you'll be seeing any wowing going on in New York City.  Remember, we used to do the boob index.  All right.  The boob index in Chicago.  You got to give him like a one, maybe a two.  Some brave women out there.  You'd have to be a lunatic.  New York is about a three or a four.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That high? 
[00:23:00]  Well, it's 35 degrees.  It gets a lot colder in New York.  All right.  We'll give it a three.  Buffalo, forget about it.  Yeah.  Forget about it.  No boobs for you today.  What about Vegas?  What about Vegas?  Vegas?  I didn't look at the weather, but I'm sure it's got to be up there.  Ten.  Yeah.  The boob index is at ten in Vegas.  West Palm.  Well, a lot of old broads down there.  But a lot of girls with braces, too.  So.  Yeah.  We saw that.  We learned a lot going down to West Palm Beach. 
[00:23:30]  West Palm, I give a solid eight.  Solid.  Dallas?  Yeah.  You got to give Dallas high numbers.  Dallas has the breast implants.  Jimmy and I have been down there a few times.  It's all about implants and guns in Dallas.  A strip club.  Nice big boobs.  Those country girls.  I would go with a solid nine in Dallas as far as Whip'em Out Wednesday goes.  Any other cities you want to hit?  Washington?  You know, that's about the same as, you know.  Nah, probably Washington, like a four.  Yeah.  They're a little warmer down there.  Boston's a two. 
[00:24:00]  Boston, two and a half.  Pushing a three today.  Yeah.  So not the most ideal day for Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Low boob index.  But the warm climates, they're enjoying Whip'em Out Wednesday.  It's really simple.  Get a WOW sticker.  Get it on your car.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  Women are out there, and they will flash you if they see the WOW stickers.  WOW, of course, stands for Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Of course it does.  And some of the stations we're on there, they're just lazy.  They don't know how to push the show, and they don't even have WOW stickers. 
[00:24:30]  They don't even know how to make WOW stickers.  So, you know, you have to take it upon yourself at that point and make a homemade WOW sticker,  okay?  Or Whip'em Out Wednesday on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Wow.  I was enjoying talking over the music.  I felt like I was back at AF, the only station that really rocks.  Where every second we talked, music was glaring.  Oh, enough.  Enough with the music.  All right.  E-Rock is getting the bush crying audio for us. 
[00:25:00]  He wanted us to stall because he's getting the BB Gun Kid audio as well.  BB Gun Kid.  Yeah, where he cries after getting shot by a BB Gun.  Oh, yeah.  That is a good one.  Well, we like breaking out the...  Little faggot.  We like breaking out some of our favorite crying clips whenever a new one comes about.  Celebrities, sports figures, always good.  Retirement speeches, things like that.  They'll break down, start crying.  You got the Mike Schmidt.  Yeah.  Just famous. 
[00:25:30]  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable audio.  And then politicians.  They tend to tear up every so often.  Who is that woman politician that just lost her mind?  McGreevey.  Like they were saying, it cost her the president, you know, any chance at the presidency or vice  presidency.  A woman?  Yeah, some broad.  Oh.  She started crying.  Well, that's not what caused her to lose the chance for the vice presidency.  It's the fact that there's a mess that is replacing what makes a man a man. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  Yes.  It's called the irrational hole.  You need something that looks like an intercontinental ballistic missile.  I need to know who this woman is now.  I don't know who you're talking about.  I can't remember her damn name.  Well, they'll pop it up on instant feedback.  Some smarty out there will help us.  Did you ever cry watching someone cry?  I know this sounds like a bit we sent back in the back.  Like, it's funny.  Let me throw this out.  I got choked up.  I got choked up. 
[00:26:30]  The only time I'll get choked up is watching someone getting choked up is a perfect example.  Watch the last episode of the Band of Brothers with the old World War II guys talking about  it.  It's, you know, frigging how many years later?  Jesus Christ.  And they're talking about these guys that they fought with and just, like, they lose it.  Not completely, but they just kind of, their voice cracks and they got to kind of stop and  pull away a little bit. 
[00:27:00]  And that just gets to me, like, every time.  It's like, oh, this guy is still affected by this so many years later.  Of course.  I, uh, can I go next?  You got one, too, Jimmy?  No, I was just asking.  Do you have one?  I do, yeah.  All right.  I, uh, I was bawling last night.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Oh, no.  I hate that we're starting to show this.  Our personality is wonderful.  Oh.  I was watching, um, Little People, Big World.  Oh, no.  Stop.  The Midget Show. 
[00:27:30]  Get me something hot.  I have.  Get me something hot.  A hot beverage.  I, uh, I can't get enough of Little People, Big World.  And a hot beverage launcher.  On, uh, on TLC.  Yeah.  It is the greatest show.  I discovered it, uh, I don't know, last year.  I can't get enough of this dumb thing.  Yeah.  And I, I have a tough time making fun of midgets these days.  When we do the midget sightings, it hurts a little.  Oh.  Because I know they're people just like you and I.  Oh, no.  So you kind of got a little choked up at the midgets? 
[00:28:00]  So, uh, yeah, Little People, Big World.  Well, they, uh, they focus on this, uh, this one midget, uh, Zach.  Yeah.  Zach is 13 years old and he's 30, uh, 30 inches tall.  William Bob Kelly's lap at the time?  Yeah.  He's, he's, he's, I guess he's right around, actually.  I think he's just under three feet tall.  Yeah.  And he's 13.  And he's got a little, like, uh, stubby hands.  Aw.  And he, he likes to bowl and, uh, his bowling ball is 10 pounds and he weighs 30 pounds. 
[00:28:30]  Wow.  His, his bowling ball only has one hole for the thumb because the other fingers aren't long  enough to get into any other holes.  And then he, he, he throws this ball.  Cyclops ball.  With all his might.  And he's actually a really good bowler.  He would probably kick all our asses in bowling, which is pretty bizarre.  Yeah, in bowling.  I bet I could deck him in a couple of punches, though.  You're going to beat him in life.  The little fella is on Little People Big World and his, and his father is, uh, shipping 
[00:29:00]  out to Iraq.  So they, so they, they showed how emotional it is for, for, you know, the father to go  away to war and leave the family behind.  That, that's sad.  That's sad for anybody.  I guess his, uh, father's of normal size.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If he's shipping off to Iraq.  He's just, he's, he's, no, he's his size.  He's a spy.  He just walks into enemy camp and stands around and listens.  No one sees him.  This is scary.  This is a little turd.  This is a turd here. 
[00:29:30]  And, uh, and they had to show the, the, the, the, the, the farewell.  Oh.  The mom and, and little three foot 13 year old Zach.  Oh.  Saying goodbye to dad.  Did he throw his little arms around him?  Yeah.  And then, you know, he jumps into mom's arms and he's just inconsolable.  He's just, he's just, he's just bawling and wailing.  And then the father just drives off.  And I, I look at, uh, my girlfriend to my right.  She's bawling.  I'm like, all right, what the hell?  I'll let a couple, uh, spill out show that I'm doing too. 
[00:30:00]  I don't want to kill the mood, but that Zach sounds like a bad boy.  This stupid little people, big world.  I can't get enough of it.  Dopey bowling ball.  I know.  It's one hold ball.  He's a tough kid.  It's like every radio show in America.  The show's on, uh, TLC, which is the freak network, by the way.  Tender loving care network.  Oh, the learning channel.  It's the freak network.  It's, it is like, uh, it is the, the, the freak show, the sideshow for TV. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  You know, but.  They do it under the guise that they're showing, you know, diversity and things like that.  But yeah, it is a freak show.  TLC, tiny little creeps.  And naughty Zach.  Like I tell you, it takes a lot for me to get any kind of, uh, you know, moist eyes going.  Emotion.  It takes a lot.  But yesterday, maybe because we were tired from the trip.  I don't know.  See, or emotionally drained.  I don't know, but I mean, seeing any father shipping off to Iraq and leaving a family behind  is brutal.  And then to know that this kid has a, has a tough life to begin with and he's losing his 
[00:31:00]  father.  The only one that really, you know, gives a crap about him as a normal person is gone.  The only male that doesn't spit on him when he walks by.  Doesn't do it.  The old, the old, the old dudes though.  It's over, Johnny.  The end, right at the end, there's this one, uh, one old soldier.  And he goes, he goes, you know, my grandson asked me, were you a hero in the war?  And he goes, no, but I've served in a company of them.  Oh, it was like, Oh Christ on a pony style. 
[00:31:30]  How bad do you, how bad do you cry though?  No, it's just like, I get like, like I got to make that loud swallow.  Like, Oh Jesus.  What, where are you going here?  Stop this.  Turn it off.  Put a cartoon on.  Do you go and make excuses before it gets really bad?  You're like, I, uh, I got to go check the water heater.  Like I know, like I know what's coming.  That would be too.  Yeah.  Right.  I think there's a leak downstairs.  Right.  Well, you know, guys, we're not supposed to cry ever. 
[00:32:00]  So when it starts happening, you're like, well, you know, you know, that point's coming.  So I grab the water off of my night table and go, oops, and spill it all over my face.  Oh, damn.  Look, I spilled water on me.  Or spill it all over the couch.  Oh, wow.  Look what I did.  I got to go.  I got to go get a rag.  I'll be right back.  Oh God.  Jimmy, you got one?  I have many.  I'm such a blub.  I'm a blub.  The one, the one with personality wise.  I remember watching Ozzy cry. 
[00:32:30]  He's talking about his wife's cancer.  Oh, that was awful.  Yeah.  Horrible.  But I'm a blubbering idiot anyway.  I mean, I watch movies.  I'm always, I'm the worst.  Are you really?  I'm awful.  Truly awful.  Yeah.  It borders on manic depressive.  It's not healthy.  Yeah.  It's not like normal.  It's not a healthy release.  No.  It's almost like, I don't care about the movie.  I'm still, it's like, it's just an excuse to finally cry.  What a bunch of watch women.  Oh, we are awful.  Ah, sissies.  Crying over old soldiers.  He's got fidgets, making him weep. 
[00:33:00]  Then you're just bawling over stupid movies.  For no reason at all.  Nothing.  Just a little Mary Ann.  Mary Ann.  I'm a little Marjorie Ann.  Watching Animal House and tearing up at Flounder's dented car.  Oh, I've cried at the dumbest.  I can't even tell you how many movies.  It's revolting.  Look, man.  We're sharing here today.  Oh, no.  And Stephen from Bayshore, he writes.  Of course.  Little People, Big World.  I was just talking about it on TLC.  Steve wishes that the show would become Little People, Big Fly Swatter. 
[00:33:30]  Kill those horrid little bastards.  The fans are so awful.  It's like they don't want you to.  I was online one time and this guy instant messaged me and he goes, if I hear you talking  about your girlfriend happily one more time, I'm going to slap you in the face.  There's a whole thread on the message board.  Jimmy's got a girlfriend.  Does this suck?  Like, they think it sucks.  I can't help it.  Of course not.  You've seen enough of the other side.  Jesus.  It's all I had.  You should have been with us on the trip then, people. 
[00:34:00]  And seen this loving, psychopathic couple that are absolutely made for each other.  Just not right.  Jesus Christ.  She's as loony as you are.  She's nuts.  She's nuts.  Yeah, definitely entertaining, though.  Hey, E-Rock, are we waiting for the BB kid still?  E-Rock.  What am I doing?  Look at him running over.  That was more like one of those stupid jogs people do across the street when you're waiting  for him to cross. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  That was a half-assed run, E-Rock.  He looked like a fat black man power walking.  That's how Eric runs.  That's really good.  All right.  Hey, no, this isn't Oprah and the Anthony show.  The Oprah and Anthony show.  Oh, what a bunch of crybabies.  People are saying that I got the kid's name wrong. 
[00:35:00]  Look, man, we traveled all day.  It was the little strawberry blonde midget that's only 30-some-odd inches tall.  He's the smallest of the bunch.  The little guy.  He's small in the midget world.  They look at him and go, wow, you're short.  Oh, that's bad.  I thought his name was Zach.  I still think his name is Zach.  But if you're going to be short, you should be that short.  Just some people go, wow, this is really interesting as opposed to gross.  Yeah.  He's the ultimate short.  Let's say hi to Jesse in Maine.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  What's going on? 
[00:35:30]  What's up?  Yeah.  Well, I heard you guys talking about celebrities and crying and whatnot, and I even got choked  up one time when Andre Agassi retired at the U.S. Open.  He made that speech, and he was just going on and on and on about everything.  Wasn't he all choked up?  I thought we had that audio.  Did we have that one?  Oh, yeah.  You cried at this.  Yeah.  Stay on the line.  Maybe we'll get you weeping, too, you little faggot.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, this is Andre Agassi. 
[00:36:00]  Well, maybe not.  Is this from recently or no?  Yeah, this past time.  At least I get a little teary-eyed with guys recollecting their friends getting blown  apart right in front of them.  This guy is a tennis player.  Yeah, guy in white shorts.  I saw this.  Tight white shorts, and he hits a ball real good.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  All right, so I cried over a midget.  I got to stay out of this one.  He uses a special ball to ball.  Hey, coach, take me out of the game.  I can't be part of this one.  I'm going to go play with the faggots on the other side of the gym. 
[00:36:30]  Over the last 21 years, I have found loyalty.  You have pulled from me on the court and also in life.  I have found inspiration.  You have willed me to succeed, sometimes even in my lowest moments.  And I have found generosity.  You have given me your shoulders to stand on, to reach for my dreams, dreams I could have 
[00:37:00]  never reached without you.  Over the last 21 years, I have found you.  He certainly is whinging.  And I will take you and the memory of you with me for the rest of my life.  Yeah, right.  Thank you.  As I go back to my gated community, I will take you with me.  It's just, you know, Godfather, I need that movie.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  That Andre Agassi clip wouldn't make me cry if I was standing in a barrel of onions. 
[00:37:30]  All right, well, that's what makes you cry there, huh, Jesse?  Well, no, I just, I thought he was one of the greatest.  Ah, Chris in Florida, what's up?  I just can't keep riding side saddle.  It's always, it's always those movies that have animals in them that die.  Or like Ape Below or Old Yeller.  Like Horse Gag?  That one makes me cry with laughter.  Every time she tries to say something right at the end of it.  And I'm so jealous of a horse. 
[00:38:00]  Lucky devil, you.  He said he would warn me.  Oh, they never do.  I know, you just didn't understand it.  Two taps for get out of the way, sweetie.  All right, what animal movie makes you cry there, Chris?  I don't know how we got on this, but we got to go with this for a little bit.  Oh, you know, I'll sit next to the wife watching the movie like Ape Below or Old Yeller.  Old Yeller everybody brings up.  She's not crying a bit, and I'm trying to hide it.  Like I'm a man, you know, and I'm wiping my eye like it itches. 
[00:38:30]  Like he's a man.  That's funny.  Yeah.  I know I'm not, but like I was.  All right, someone on the S&F feedback on their cell phone.  Opie will crush a homeless man's cake, but he cries at midgets.  Yeah, I know.  We were all emotionally a little drained yesterday.  Yeah.  Greg on Long Island, what's up?  Oh.  How about the movie Rudy?  Yeah, if you're not crying at the end of Rudy, man.  No, that didn't do it.  Really?  Yeah, sorry.  It was nice, though, but I don't know.  Pretty inspirational.  Yeah, you get to make a tackle and go home. 
[00:39:00]  That's great.  Oh, well.  You get also feel retarded.  Exactly.  Stop hanging out with children, you pedophile slash ass.  Oh, you want to talk about an embarrassing real life one?  I forgot about this.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Strep in.  It was recently.  It was with my girlfriend.  And we were in bed.  It was dark.  This is true, too.  And I forget what we were talking about, but I was happy to be dating her.  You know, just kind of happy that a lot of the madness or silliness is over. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  And I cried a little bit, but it wasn't loud.  It wasn't for showboating purposes.  It wasn't like, you know, we were just laying there talking, and I was, like, getting a  little, you know, worked up.  Nothing crazy.  She had no idea.  A little misty.  Oh, misty, exactly.  A little misty.  Jesus.  And she didn't know.  And we're talking, and she starts touching my face, and she feels it, and she didn't know,  and she moved her hand.  She goes, ew, why is your face wet?  Good.  Good for her. 
[00:40:00]  She should have given you one of her tampons to dab your eyes with.  Oh, or I should have shown her a horse gag and say, that would be more dignified than  why it's really wet.  Ew, why is your face wet?  Ew, why is your face wet?  And then she realized what it was.  She's like, I'm sorry.  I'm like, it's all right, castrating.  Castrating, Hitler Youth.  I'm just laying here.  That is fantastic.  Ew, why is your face wet?  Oh, that's great.  Hey, let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, Max.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I've got to agree with Anthony, but one of the stat ones is Saving Private Ryan when the guy's 
[00:40:30]  just a tombstone.  Oh, yeah, that's a bad one.  Okay.  Every time I see that, I fall.  But hey, Anthony, if you don't want to cry anymore, just keep a copy of your bank statement  right there on the table beside you.  Just glance over at it.  Punching out, boys.  No.  I use that on my way to the bank.  It gets me laughing all the way there.  Anthony from Las Vegas.  I cried when Brittany started wearing panties again.  Yeah, that was a very sad day for everybody.  For everybody.  Some things are supposed to make you cry that don't.  Forrest Gump had some sad moments in it, but when he's standing under the oak tree talking 
[00:41:00]  to his wife, who's buried like a German shepherd in the yard.  I know.  No kidding.  I found it to be more.  I so knew what they were going for and it annoyed me.  Yeah.  Forrest is smart.  It was laughable.  Yeah.  It was laughable.  It was a good movie, but that kind of bugged me.  Sometimes when they go so far to make you cry.  Yep.  Then it just, there's nothing there.  No.  It makes you laugh sometimes. 
[00:41:30]  When they try to make you cry and you're laughing.  How about this one?  How about this one?  This is one of the most famous ones.  Mike Schmidt, everyone.  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio with two very bad knees.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I thank God the dream came true. 
[00:42:00]  Stop whining.  Almighty.  You know, every time we play that clip.  Stop it.  Every time we play that clip, by the way, we get hate mail.  People get pissed.  Why?  That we're making fun of that clip.  Too bad.  They love their cement.  I don't mind somebody getting a little choked up.  That was wow.  He was just all up, curled out under an afghan.  Yeah.  Letting it fly.  Goddamn Lou Gehrig had to stand there knowing he was going to shake himself to pieces.  Or whatever that disease does. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, no.  He turned to cement.  And a guy gave his speech with dignity like a man.  That's right.  Paul O'Neill crying in like 97, I think.  There's no audio on it, though, because it was just visual.  It was after the Yanks won the series.  His dad had died that year.  Yeah.  Oh, that was horrible.  Oh, really?  Horrible.  Bad one.  Horrible.  Let's go to Pete.  What's up, Pete?  Hey.  Hey.  What makes me cry is the end of Independence Day when Randy Quaid is going up there with  Hang up.  Hang up on him.  Hang up on him.  Hang up on him.  Yeah, I felt this. 
[00:43:00]  Shut up.  Okay, I thought he was serious.  Okay, you're kidding.  That's funny.  I thought he was serious.  When Randy Quaid dies because he's, you know, got to fly up into the ship with the missile.  I cried after Will Smith made his first bad joke.  It was a good movie up to that point.  I was really enjoying it.  Oh, I know.  And then he has to turn all urban.  You're all upset and black folks.  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.  You don't need that.  Well, here's a good one.  Shucking and jiving.  Exactly.  Well, that I liked.  Bruce in Massachusetts.  Bruce. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, sweetie.  How you guys doing today?  Hey.  Good.  What makes me cry is that every week, Sunday night, extreme makeover, home edition.  Stop it.  Why?  I love that show because they usually build those palaces in the middle of the ghetto.  Yeah, the horrible neighborhoods.  And then the cameras and the crews leave and these people have to fend for themselves within the neighborhood.  I think it's the greatest show ever.  That's when they really should start rolling hidden cameras. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Because they saw what they.  Night vision.  They know they got the flat screens in there and the great stereo systems and the nice water beds and what have you.  And then they go home like, well, our job is done here.  Bye-bye.  And you look around the neighborhood, they do these makeovers and you're like, oh boy, the locals are going to just have a field day with this house.  Oh, we got a bunch of stuff worth a lot of money in here.  The first time that family leaves to go to grandma's house for a little baked apple pie, their house is going to be taken apart like, I don't know, cockroaches. 
[00:44:30]  Uh, no, like, uh, what?  No, uh, what's the?  Ant's taking apart a cricket.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  Here's another one that we love.  Wrestling fan crying.  Oh, this guy could be the most killable person I've ever heard.  What was the setup for this?  There's a guy and he's at.  It's, you know, it's, uh, they brought a few wrestlers to a high school gym, I believe. 
[00:45:00]  Was that it?  Iraq would know because this is in fact Iraq.  Iraq?  This, uh, this old guy starts crying about a wrestler announcing he's retiring.  Yeah.  Thanks for answering my question.  How old is this guy?  In a high school gym.  I'm so glad that, uh, you were listening.  Iraq, the boss wants an answer.  Isn't it just in a high school gym somewhere?  Yeah, it's right here.  Holy crap.  Oh my God.  I'm going to start crying at how stupid Iraq is. 
[00:45:30]  I hope he wants to know if it was, did this take place in a high school gym?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, now, yes.  Yes, Jimmy.  But I was always saying the boss wanted to know.  He knew that right away, by the way, but he didn't know that I asked that question.  What was the, that's the big problem.  What was the, yeah, it's right here.  Yeah, answering, it was in a gym, and then right here, it's, the visual is right in front  of him so he can see.  Oh, so it's right here, and then you transfer it over to the, he's not showing.  Iraq, do yourself a favor.  Listen to the replay of the show today so you could hear how stupid you really were and 
[00:46:00]  that you weren't listening whatsoever.  I can't see it.  All right.  He's trying to defend himself.  And Sam's loving it.  Sam's ducking behind equipment laughing because he relishes.  He's crying with joy in this.  All right, here's, uh...  That is scumbag.  Here's wrestling fan crying.  Or maybe not.  What is wrong with this disc?  I don't know.  That one's always having trouble.  No, it was cued up.  I just want to thank each and every one of y'all for all you've done to your bodies. 
[00:46:30]  It's still real to me, dammit.  I mean, thank you.  Make it easy, man.  Thank y'all guys.  You're awesome.  Thank you so much, Mr. Fuck, for saying what needed to be said.  I don't want to see another one of these.  Well, thank you.  Oh, my God.  Why don't we have more audio of this guy?  Calm down, man.  Calm down, man.  He is the biggest fool I've ever seen.  What an ass of fool.  That video is up on a website I'm really not happy with, YouTube. 
[00:47:00]  Look at him.  And the YouTube video is a little longer.  Maybe we could get a longer version of that.  And you can see him.  He's a fat ass with those bad glasses.  He's exactly what you think he looks like.  He's just adult.  Yeah.  All right.  This is leading up to our latest crying clip.  Everyone's going to be talking about this today.  It's the former president just bawling about his son, Jeb.  He's an older man now.  George Bush Sr. talking about Jeb Bush. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Governor of Florida.  But first, Jared.  Jared, what's up?  Hey, fairies, moving along.  I've been praying for a commercial for 10 minutes.  Well, we are a bunch of queers.  Then you get one.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Only on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:48:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, let's get right back into this.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:48:30]  E-rock in a little while.  Doing the Chubby Bunny.  And I'm also hearing rumors that one of the guys behind the scenes, his mom won a Chubby Bunny contest.  Was it your mom?  Was it Sam's?  Oh, boy.  All right, we'll have to talk to Sam about that in a little bit.  Also, look, man.  Look, man.  Sometimes we don't know where this show goes. 
[00:49:00]  We just casually mentioned the former president, you know, bawling over his son, Jeb Bush.  Yeah.  And now we're on this crying thing.  I guess a certain GM is not getting his you-know-what today from this radio show.  You creep talking about-  Make him all hot and bothered.  Talking about your, uh, your-  God, I wish we could say it over here.  I wish we could say it.  Apparently, we need more sexual content for this guy. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  Because he wants to-  Yeah, he wants to drive around, listen to the show, and get so turned on that something-  He has a natural male physical reaction to being turned on.  Right.  And loves to chat about it to other men.  Right.  Jesus.  Likes to tell you how turned on he was.  How turned on he was.  By using the-  Yeah.  The, uh, the right words.  Right.  All the words that there are for when that happens to a guy, when he gets himself in a certain state.  So I guess this guy will not be, uh, turned on by the show today. 
[00:50:00]  No.  You creep.  Thank God, you ghoul.  And I had to stay in the car until, uh, the segment was over.  And I just kept getting-  Oh, it was just getting-  Yeah.  You know what?  Keep describing it.  It doesn't work as well over here.  We understand that.  It works much better over at XM, but somehow we got to figure out how it works well over here as well.  Because we need a lot more people to understand how creepy this was.  Well, I-  This conversation at the, uh, manager's meeting in Boca Raton Monday night. 
[00:50:30]  He's telling us, uh, that we need more sex on the show so he can have this, this thing happen to him.  Something that is usually followed by the word raging.  That's what he kept saying.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Ugh.  What a creep.  Yeah, it was-  It was kind of creepy.  Yeah, it was.  And then we moved on to the next general manager, and then it was like, no, we like that you're not, uh, uh, all about sex anymore. 
[00:51:00]  Ah, it's great.  And then we walked-  Then we moved on to the next general manager.  He's like, oh, that, uh, that puking show you did, the eggnog drinking contest.  Fantastic.  We loved it.  And then we move on to the next general manager.  You know, I wasn't feeling the eggnog drinking contest show.  You don't need to do stuff like that, guys.  That's why you don't ask anybody an opinion on anything, because it's always different.  8,000 different opinions, and that goes for you two out there, you jerks.  You just gotta follow your own, uh, your own instinct.  Right. 
[00:51:30]  In the end.  Let's say hi to Bob in Belvedere.  Hey there, Bab.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Bob?  Yeah, I went to the first Devil's Home game right after 9-11.  Yeah.  And they brought out the, uh, the woman, uh, the wife of the husband who fought the  terrorists on the plane.  Yeah.  And everyone was crying, chanting USA, USA.  It was, it was just ridiculous.  Well, 9-11, anything 9-11, you get a free pass.  Um, especially right after, because we went to a U2 concert. 
[00:52:00]  Okay, that's what I was gonna ask you.  We went to a U2 show, man.  Right after 9-11.  There wasn't a dry eye in the hat.  And I think they were playing one.  I think it was one, yeah.  It was playing one, and all it was was them on the stage playing one, and all the names  of everyone that died scrolling behind them.  Holy Jesus Christ.  It was like crap.  The whole place.  What is it?  It was at Madison Square Garden.  Yeah.  Everybody.  I don't care who the hell was in there.  Everyone was losing it.  And I want to raise my hand.  Excuse me, Bono. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Bono, we're here to forget for two hours.  Yeah.  We're gonna have a little fun.  We don't need this.  We don't need this.  Come on.  You know?  Jesus.  We were looking for a distraction.  And next thing you know, the names just, and endless.  Endless.  And the flights that they were on and everything.  Oh, it was just, oh.  They even, like, listed.  Heart-wrenching.  They even listed all the pets that died.  Everything.  They were fluffy, and snow comes in.  They really, really got to everybody. 
[00:53:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oof.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Yeah.  9-11 stuff.  I mean, forget about it.  All right.  We should move on here.  One more clip from the crying Hall of Fame, and then we'll play the latest one, okay?  This is the fat kid getting shot with a BB gun.  Yeah.  What was the setup for this?  Was this the kid that was stuck on the rock in the river?  Yeah.  He's on a rock in the middle of this river, and he's stuck. 
[00:53:30]  And instead of his friends helping him, they start shooting him with a BB gun.  Kids are just monsters.  And the kid couldn't really jump off this rock to get away from the BBs.  No.  The BBs that were flying at him.  So they got him, I think, in the thigh nicely here, and this is what happened.  I'm John Mike, and I'm in the lush forest of Warwick, New York.  Ow!  Stop it!  Don't, don't, don't do that!  Stop!  Stop it!  Don't shoot me anymore! 
[00:54:00]  No, no, I just want you to take the CO2 out.  Take the CO2 out and leave it out.  Stop it!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Stop!  Ow!  Ow!  Stop it, you f***ing!  Stop!  Ah, that poor kid, but goddamn, that's funny. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, is that funny?  We do have one more.  I mean, Richard Simmons, I mean, but it's Richard Simmons.  You expect him to cry.  He cries at everything.  He's crying over Michael Hebranko.  Oh, yeah?  Well, when Michael Hebranko was up to 900 pounds.  Ten years ago this week, a 940-pound Michael had to be hoisted out of his home through the  pitcher window for a trip to the hospital.  Oh, like a piano.  Hoping that Richard can help him shed the weight once again.  I tried. 
[00:55:00]  I need to try.  I just need to try as a corner.  I can't lose you, Michael.  It's tearing me up.  And I can't lose you.  First time he said, it's tearing me up.  Please.  He was crying.  Take yourself away from me.  Please, don't take me.  I'm sorry.  Someone get a little tissue.  I'm okay.  Someone get him a tissue.  All right, well.  Get this fruit out of here, please.  Yeah. 
[00:55:30]  We literally have like 50 of these.  We should find some of the other ones we've never played before and see how good they are.  There you go.  All right.  Moving on.  So what's the story with the former president and this clip we're about to hear?  Well, he was, where was he?  On the floor of the Senate, I guess.  Oh, no.  The House.  Yeah.  I don't know which floor he was on.  Those floors look alike to me.  They sure do. 
[00:56:00]  And he was up at the podium and he's talking about Jeb.  His son Jeb.  And he got a little emotional.  And when you're, you know, this former president, for God's sake.  He's head of the CIA.  Yeah.  He was head of the CIA.  Right.  George, he was Reagan's vice president for eight years.  Yep.  You ever see your dad cry when he was alive?  Yeah.  Once.  Yeah.  My dad wants to.  Yeah.  Burnt his hands on his Le Mans engine.  And he was crying.  It was more of a pain thing.  Yeah.  So he's like soaking his hands under cold water. 
[00:56:30]  And I remember walking in and being like, what's the matter?  And he just turned around and go, get the hell out of here.  But I could see he was like, you know, not in a good way.  I want to see Passion of the Christ with my dad.  Oh, my God.  Like, oh.  Just looking to the right and he's just bawling.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  It is just tough to see your dad cry.  You don't want to see that.  That's a tough one.  Me too.  Me and my dad once I watched Beaches. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  Here's the former president breaking down.  The true measure of a man is how you handle victory and also defeat.  So in 94, Floridians chose to rehire the governor.  They took note of his defeated opponent, who showed not merely with words, but of my actions, 
[00:57:30]  with Decese's hands.  They couldn't take it.  The people watching couldn't take it and just started clapping.  What else are you going to do?  He's an older man.  And then Jeb steps up and gives him like a little bottle of water to, you know, kind  of calm him down a little bit.  Give him a pat on the back.  Say, Dad, knock it off.  He hug him?  Like an ass.  Yeah, I gave him a little, you know, it was like a little pat on the back and 
[00:58:00]  gave him some water.  But boy, did he.  Wow.  Wow.  Was he having his period?  That goes in the Hall of Fame.  Yeah, we got to add that one.  Guy invaded Iraq, Kuwait to kick Iraq out.  Yeah.  1990.  There it is.  Meanwhile, Saddam is like an animal in that courtroom.  No, I won't even tell you my name.  What are you doing?  I'm the president of Iraq.  He's still all, you know.  Even when they execute him and just pull like body limbs off, not a tear is going to be 
[00:58:30]  shit.  Yeah, he won't be weeping.  Not at all.  And then there's George W. or George Bush Sr.  Jeb.  Give him some water.  Doddering old buffoon.  And that helps our image in the Middle East.  I know.  Bill's wife is running for president.  And our ex-president's weeping like a woman.  It's a castrated country.  We are just a nation of sissies.  Me included.  We all are. 
[00:59:00]  Me included.  It's horrible.  Iraq, you ready for the chubby bunny contest?  Oh, yeah.  Or experiment.  It's not really a contest.  Yes.  Although we'll be...  It's your fat stomach.  We'll be waging here in the studio and people will be waging at home.  Or wagering.  I said waging?  Yeah.  Yeah, wagering.  Waging war.  Yes.  I was thinking war, I guess.  Wagering.  Yes, you're right.  We have time to do this story.  A man accused of faking retardation for 20 years.  That's right.  20 years.  The guy faked being a retard.  And now he's doing the chubby bunny contest. 
[00:59:30]  Give me your bimitou because I changed the name of the story.  I was going to go for nearly 20 years ever since Eric Nagel was eight.  Was eight years old.  And it fits.  The age fits in everything.  You know, as soon as we all saw this story, we thought, all right, time to go funny rock  again.  Isn't that terrible?  Isn't that bad when everyone thinks the same thing?  Yeah.  He's not faking.  That's the tragedy.  This is real. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Well, this comes out of Washington for nearly 20 years.  Ever since Pete Costello was eight, his mother has collected disability benefits on his behalf.  In meetings with social security officials and psychologists, he appeared mentally retarded  and unable to communicate.  His mother insisted he couldn't read or write, shower, take care of himself or drive a car.  But now prosecutors said it was all a huge fraud.  And they have video of Costello contesting a traffic ticket to prove it. 
[01:00:30]  What an idiot.  Yep.  He had a good thing going.  What are you doing?  He got greedy.  Yep.  People just get greedy with their scams out there.  Yeah.  He he's like any other person trying to get out of a traffic ticket.  Uh, assistant U.S. attorney, blah, blah, blah.  Said Tuesday, Pete and Rosie Rose.  Uh, yeah.  Rosie Marie Costello were indicted in September on charges of conspiracy to defraud the government  and social security fraud.  And the case was unsealed Tuesday.  And it goes on.  The Vancouver pair were scheduled to appear in federal court and blah, blah, blah. 
[01:01:00]  Uh, Barbosa said he planned to file with the court two videos of Pete Costello taken this year.  In one, he allegedly feigns retardation during an interview with social security workers.  The other is of him contesting the traffic ticket in a courtroom earlier this year.  Sounding like, you know, professional lawyer probably.  And then the other one just drooling.  He should have contested it just by picking it up and eating it in court. 
[01:01:30]  Ah, $111,000?  Yeah.  Yeah, he got $111,000 over the years.  Man.  That's 400 million Canadian.  They don't know whether he is retarded to some degree, but he's clearly...  Wait, I missed a good one.  I know.  You missed a dud.  I swung and missed so hard on that one, I pulled back muscles.  Andy Pettit coming back to the Yankees.  I can't tell you how sick that makes me. 
[01:02:00]  34 years old.  Sure, why not?  Why do you want him when he's 31, 32, 33?  Get him when he's 34.  George knows how to get him young.  He's an ass.  They never should have let him go to begin with, but I don't want to talk about the Yankees.  I'm disgusted with the whole team, and I hope they lose again and again and again and again.  That's what you get.  So again and again and again and again.  And again and again.  So five years from now, you're hoping for a World Series win?  No.  Oh.  I hope they're not again.  More agains?  Yeah.  We're going to have to root for somebody.  Again, infinity.  We're smashing the Yankees' teeth in.  You like baseball too much, Jimmy.  You've got to find a new team. 
[01:02:30]  Go Tigers.  I don't care about them either.  Atlanta.  America's team.  Yeah.  I just like Jane Fonda.  I know.  She's a strong woman.  Dude, shut up.  Tommy.  All right.  There's not much to this story.  Retardation for 20 years.  We need like audio and some more examples.  Yeah, I want to see the video.  I want to hear the audio.  Right.  I want to see him feigning to be a retard and see if he can be a producer for this program. 
[01:03:00]  Speaking of which, the chubby bunny goes down next.  Yep.  Hey, where's Sam?  His mom won a chubby bunny contest.  Sam.  There he is.  Wasn't on camera.  Did you have a good time while we were in West Palm Beach, Florida?  I missed you.  Aw, look at that kiss ass.  So your mom did a chubby bunny contest?  Yeah, she won.  She won?  Yeah, when I was in fifth grade in Cub Scouts. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  On a camping trip.  Goody two-shoes.  On a camping trip in Cub Scouts.  Oh, he got touched so bad.  Of course he did.  How could they not?  I want to touch him.  Oh.  Oh.  All the scout moms got together and had a chubby bunny contest.  Yeah.  My mom won with 23 marshmallows.  23?  Yep.  I bet right now that E-Rock doesn't beat Sam's mom in the chubby bunny contest.  23?  Yep.  E-Rock is going to lose to a woman.  Standard size marshmallows? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  And how does the contest go, Sam?  You just have to, every time you put one marshmallow in your mouth, you say chubby bunny.  You put another one in, you say it again, you say it again.  And you have to stop when you either can't say it or you gag, which is, or you gag.  At the same time.  Where are you from?  I'm from New York.  New York.  Really?  I just like checking.  Yeah.  Obviously a part of not many people go to because I don't really recognize that accent.  Western New York, it's south of Michigan.  Yeah.  I'm from Canada. 
[01:04:30]  Canada.  I am from Vancouver.  All right.  Well, we'll do that in a few minutes here.  Wow, that's a lot of marshmallows.  Yeah.  Did you see this?  Oh, yeah.  Was everyone laughing?  Yeah, it was a good time.  Yeah.  And then what happened when she had to take the marshmallows out of her mouth?  Because I hear that's kind of disgusting.  Yeah.  You just have to spit out as much as you can.  It's like a lot of drool.  Yeah.  White marshmallow drool.  Were some of the older people making jokes that the kids didn't understand yet?  Yeah.  Certainly hope not.  But I bet they were. 
[01:05:00]  Look at young Sam.  What a fine upbringing.  At the Cub Scout meeting, mom's doing a chubby bunny content.  Yeah, mom's involved.  Yeah.  Like parent taking interest in their child's upbringing.  Just before they told scary stories around the campfire.  He's saying ghost stories.  Of course you're shaking your head.  Spook stories.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  Well...  I don't know if that's an insult or not.  Speaking of which.  Can't tell with him.  Thank you, Sam.  Sam's not black. 
[01:05:30]  His ancestors, Thomas Jefferson.  He's not black.  He doesn't have big lips, just a real big thong.  Well, his skin's kind of weird.  It's not black or white.  If he's white, then he's dark.  If he's black, he's light.  Who the hell can figure? 
[01:06:00]  Who the hell can figure?  If Sam's white or a...  White or a...  Yeah, we tease him, you know.  Because he's white with an afro.  Sam's not black.  He's not black.  Don't smoke crack.  He ain't black.  That wouldn't work to our advantage, by the way.  Because we cleaned it up for this side of the radio show.  And I think it's fun here with mm-mm-mm.  Yeah.  He should have actually, instead of even doing that, he should have said,  if he's white or if he's not white or something else, 
[01:06:30]  he should have just totally broken from the back.  Yeah, not white.  Oh, really?  I kind of like it that way.  Or, ah, because he still says it.  He should have completely not said it.  Hey, Mike Woods, we can't get enough of this guy.  It might be subtle, I don't know, but we just can't get enough of Mike Woods.  Mike Woods.  A local weather guy in New York City.  He works for Fox.  We missed him when we were in West Palm.  Yeah.  We actually were wishing that we could see him on TV.  It's something we do when we're preparing for the show.  We watch Mike Woods attempt to improv before he does his weather report. 
[01:07:00]  Every anchor has to talk to the weather guy.  And a lot of times in the morning, the weather people are not in the studio.  They are outside.  And they're, you know, talking about how cold it is.  And, you know, it's firsthand because they're right out there.  And then they give their five-day forecast or whatever they do.  And there's a little chit-chat between the anchor and the weather person.  These guys are all just wanting to be real entertainers.  Yeah.  They're not journalists.  Like, Cronkite was a journalist, news guy.  Rather, these guys want to be entertainers. 
[01:07:30]  And the news is just the route they take.  When they would talk to each other, like, if Cronkite was hooked up and talking to someone in the field, it was only about the story.  Yes.  It was like, okay, could you clear up this?  Or, you know, what was the statement that was made?  Something like that.  It wasn't this little chit-chat that has nothing to do with anything.  And Mike Woods is by far the worst I've ever seen at doing this.  He is incapable of improvisation with this anchor woman. 
[01:08:00]  And she sets him up every day.  Just sets him up for the big fall every day.  Good old Lucy Nolan.  And today, I believe they were discussing winter weather wear.  Because it's cold here.  It's the first couple of days it's been cold here in New York.  We've had a pretty mild winter so far.  So they were talking about certain winter weather gear.  And Mike just trips over his own tongue again.  And brain.  Here we go.  Let's check in. 
[01:08:30]  With Fox 5 Weather Authority, Mike Woods, he's all bundled up in Times Square.  I still think you probably need a muffler or something like that.  Little scarf?  A muffler?  A scarf.  My grandma would have said a muffler.  I don't know if I'm going that far.  Yeah, I'm going to have to hold out a few more weeks for that.  It's called a muffler.  33 degrees.  Isn't that one of those things?  Yeah.  A muffler makes a scarf.  There it is.  There it is.  Just let that sink in.  Let that sink in.  A muffler.  Isn't that one of those things? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Like he couldn't even come up with a way to describe a muffler maybe being something  that's under a car.  I think.  I think.  I don't want to try to think for Mike Woods here.  But I think he was going for that.  Like, isn't a muffler something that's under a car?  Exhaust pipe, something, tailpipe, anything.  And he just went, isn't a muffler?  Yeah.  Just lost his mind.  Yeah, I'm going to have to hold out a few more weeks for that. 
[01:09:30]  It's called a muffler.  33 degrees.  A muffler.  Isn't that one of those things?  Yeah.  A muffler makes cars quiet, but it also keeps your neck warm.  Yeah.  They're different.  Okay, that's what I was going to say.  You're nuts.  I don't understand this.  But whatever you say.  Right now, anything that keeps you a little bit warmer definitely can help.  But I'm a tough guy, and that's why I'm not going for it.  All right?  Here's what we have.  What?  Wow.  This is the best.  This is New York City. 
[01:10:00]  This is just the opposite of the other story.  This is a guy who's faking not being retarded.  Poorly.  What a dope.  The poor son of a bitch.  Could you just let him do the weather?  Once he gets to the weather part of it, he's fine.  I'll give him that.  He can look at a map of New York and point to the cities in numbers.  It's going to be 44 degrees here.  It's going to be 42 here.  He can do that.  Yeah.  But do not get him off track. 
[01:10:30]  Don't get him off the script.  The problem is I just had a thought.  Leave me.  Wow.  You pulled a mic.  No, I'm not doing it to be funny.  I really had a thought.  I had a very, very cohesive thought.  What's your girlfriend, man?  What?  See?  Just screwing Jimmy up.  I'm just being a dopey listener.  Oh, I haven't even read.  They don't count that they carry the way.  What are they doing?  No.  It's not.  We're cute hats in West Palms.  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  We bought matching hats.  They bought matching hats at the airport and just giggle as they walk down the aisles. 
[01:11:00]  People are annoyed.  Their planes are all delayed.  They're sitting there miserable.  And Jimmy and his girlfriend just bought brand new pink and blue West Palm Beach hat.  Not even blue.  That faggy purple color.  Yeah.  It was like a purple color.  It just said West Palm Beach on the front.  With palm trees.  And we were doing that awful fake laughing.  Walking through the tunnel just going, yeah.  I know.  All loud.  It's just horrendous.  Annoying people.  Love it. 
[01:11:30]  What was I going to say about Mike Woods?  I'm so stupid.  Think about it for a second here.  Dan from PA.  He's actually a brilliant broadcaster.  He was going to say, isn't a muffler under a car, you dumb C?  And then he caught himself.  No, I think he's just stupid.  Yeah.  That's it.  I forgot.  Oh, you forgot?  Okay.  There's a second part to this Mike Woods thing.  Mike Woods in Times Square.  By the way, I looked it up on dictionary.com.  Number one definition for muffler, a scarf worn around one's neck for warmth. 
[01:12:00]  Just FYI.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So now you know.  It has nothing to do with that thing on the back of the car.  Well, it does have nothing to do with that too, but that's a different muffler.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, you can learn something every day.  The other muffles the sound.  I thought a muffler was something you stick your hands in or something like that.  Yeah.  Those are gloves.  What you're talking about sounds more like a scarf or something.  I don't know.  Call me crazy.  Whatever it is you need today.  I actually love it.  Yes, you definitely do.  You got to warm it up here today.  Wow.  I didn't notice that.  He said, call me crazy.  A lot of people do. 
[01:12:30]  He said.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's completely on to this.  Absolutely.  He knows we watch him every morning.  He's not good, but she also stinks.  Her phony laugh.  Stop trying to make a moment.  And they just talk over each other all the time.  They think they're cute.  They think it's endearing.  No.  And friendship-like.  And you know what it is?  It's phony crap.  Yeah, just they're not capable of carrying on a conversation. 
[01:13:00]  I don't need newscasters with personalities.  No.  All you are is you're a newspaper that I can listen to.  That's what you are.  You're not supposed to entertain me.  You're not entertaining people.  You don't read the newspaper and all of a sudden in the middle of the story there's chit-chat going on.  Yeah, the AP guy is talking to the chick in the, I don't know, muffler on your neck, ha-ha.  And then in parentheses, phony laugh ensues.  And then story continues.  Did you know that muffler is a scarf, by the way?  No.  No.  And now that I know it, I forgot it already until you said it again. 
[01:13:30]  I had no idea.  Let's-  I know they call, that thing that Mike Woods thought, that you put your hands in, is called a muff.  Yeah.  It's called, it's that, it's usually made of some kind of rabbit fur.  Yeah.  And girls wear them, and they put their hands in that muff.  Yeah.  Too bad she wasn't asking what a muzzle is.  That's furry, furry muff.  Right.  Yes.  Hey, Chris on Long Island, what's up?  Hey.  What's the difference?  He's hot.  That's why he's there. 
[01:14:00]  He's good looking.  He's not there for entertainment.  So you think he's hot?  Yeah, he's hot.  Well, he's built like a brick crap house.  The guy is huge.  He wears these suits that every day it looks like the buttons are going to pop off of him.  You're going to see a big S on his chest.  Yeah.  The guy's giant.  If we ever faced him, we'd be, we'd be just, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm  going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  Scared.  There's a giant S for stupid.  Just another dumb jock.  Dumb jock, stop trying to improv.  God gave you that body and those looks.  Be happy with it.  Don't try to have personality. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, we're missing something here, though.  Chris is a size queen.  We love talking to the size queens, Chris.  Yeah.  Yeah, he is.  And that's why he's there.  What's the difference?  It's a dumb blonde is there.  She's hot.  What's the difference?  Are you a size queen, though?  We've got to get the hotness in.  Why not?  We've got to get the hotness in this show so that GM can, you know, get that raging.  Talk about his raging one.  That's why I want to come in and see what Opie's talking.  He said he was big, so.  Oh.  Hey, I do all right.  Wow.  I do all right. 
[01:15:00]  All right, Chris, thank you.  I take care.  Yeah.  You think he just, like, kind of walks down the hall and goes into the cubicles and we're  in the middle of a sales meeting?  He's in charge of all the suits.  God, I was listening to Opie and Anthony this morning.  I got to tell you about the raging one I had.  Let me tell you about it.  And as they continued, it just got...  And graphic detail.  I'm going to give you a minute-by-minute countdown of what happened.  Turgid and pulsed.  How it was.  You're a creep.  Don't talk to other men about your raging blank blank. 
[01:15:30]  Stop.  Don't dump out of that, Al.  I think I kept it clean.  Oh, yeah.  Al.  What do you say, Al?  Did you let that one go through, Al?  Hey, Chubby Bunny, why don't we do that next, huh?  Right.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony wow stickers are your tickets to a successful whip-em-out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that wow stickers have many other uses? 
[01:16:00]  I built my entire house out of wow stickers and two-by-fours.  Solid as a rock.  Oh, crap.  I'm not insured.  It's Opie and Anthony!  No.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Coming this weekend to the Saturday Night Virus, Brother Weez, Opie's mentor, will be broadcasting live from XM in New York City.  From 9 p.m. to midnight, this Saturday, December 9th.  That's Brother Weez, this Saturday, December 9th at 9 p.m. 
[01:16:30]  Opie and Anthony!  All right, we're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  And also, let's remind people that it's whip-em-out Wednesday today.  Yeah.  It's cold in a lot of the cities we broadcast to, but it's happening somewhere. 
[01:17:00]  We're in Vegas.  We're in Dallas.  We're in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Is this going to be the coldest walkover so far?  It's not that bad, Ant.  Yeah?  It's going to get a lot colder.  It's going to be in the 40s today in New York.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's probably right up there.  Yeah, make sure you get your wow stickers.  Throw them on your cars and your trucks and your bicycles and your motor...  Motorcycles?  Bicycles.  When you're doing those wheelies down the Long Island Expressway.  Jesus.  I love that.  Enough.  Enough. 
[01:17:30]  See that in the rear view mirror of your car?  Oh, my God.  Motorcycle come roaring up behind you, doing a wheelie at about 80.  It's just unbelievable what they're doing on the bikes these days.  Because they got the fat tires now, Ant.  It's a Long Island thing.  It really is.  Mm-mm.  No?  No way.  They're doing it up in Boston.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  See it all over Long Island on the parkways and the expressway.  Mess.  Scraping kids up off the street.  Just zigging and zagging. 
[01:18:00]  He was such a good boy.  I've seen some movies.  I can't believe it.  Mm-hmm.  Where they cut right in front of you and the car that's in front of you.  And it's like, it barely has enough room for the bike itself.  And they go for it.  Yep.  Unbelievable.  But anyway, wow stickers.  Yeah, get them on your rides.  And there are women out there that will flash you if they see the wow stickers.  Whip them out.  Wednesday.  Wow.  All right.  I just saw an ad, by the way, as we were talking before, for Rocky Balboa.  Yeah.  Stallone is officially an embarrassment. 
[01:18:30]  Not digging the guy.  How bad do you need your ego satisfied, stupid?  How much attention do you need?  You're not digging on the Rocky Balboa?  No, and I asked Eric to look the name up.  And again, it's another faggoty, rocky boxer guy named Mason Dixon.  That's who he's fighting?  Yeah.  Clubber Lang.  Apollo Creed.  Who's named this?  George Foreman, Mike Tyson, Jerry Cooney, Muhammad Ali, Michael Spinks. 
[01:19:00]  They're just regular guy names, except Ali, and that's even regular.  Clubber Lang.  Clubber Lang.  It's Hollywood, though.  How about Douchey Bag?  Who did he change his own name to?  It's going to just be an awful movie.  Dude, he was great in Copland.  He was kind of chubby.  He was weak.  He was half deaf.  Yeah.  Is he going to die in the ring?  Because enough.  Die in the ring.  And at the box office.  Most people will laugh openly in the theaters when it happens.  Oh, you don't think there's going to be a bunch of tears shed for Rocky? 
[01:19:30]  Rocky Balboa.  Rocky, Rocky.  And they'll show up because they kill off Talia Shire.  Oh, good.  In the movie.  Excellent.  Not in the movie.  I think she's dead right when the movie starts.  Because she realized that she didn't want to be in.  Yeah, they couldn't get her in this movie.  Good.  Hell no.  I'm not doing this.  So I picture the end of the movie.  And I know nothing about this pure speculation that maybe Pauly or someone is as graveside and  it's Rocky's tombstone.  No.  No. 
[01:20:00]  No?  I wish to.  No.  No?  He's holding out hope for another one.  Get out of here.  Stop it.  It's going to be.  Then there'll be a prequel.  No.  It's going to be he does what he does and he has the big moment where he did what he said  he was going to do.  Whatever that's going to be.  Whether it's going to be the fight itself or some other dumb thing.  And then the movie's going to end with him looking at a gravestone and go, I did it.  I did it.  I did it.  I did it.  I did it.  I did it. 
[01:20:30]  I did it.  I did it.  That's what it's going to be.  You think he's going to hold out hope for that?  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then maybe finally he'll kill himself in the next one.  People are tired.  He's not dying in this movie.  There's no way.  No?  No.  No way.  We've had enough of the Rocky character.  It's 30 years.  Great movies.  First two.  The first one was obviously an Oscar winner, right?  First one, great.  Yeah.  Part two was good.  Even part three I kind of liked.  Part three was kind of cool.  All garbage. 
[01:21:00]  Stop trying to be an action hero.  You're an older man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're an older gentleman.  He's kind of frightening.  Hey.  It looks weird because he's got all these muscles, but the skin doesn't quite adhere to them anymore.  No.  He's an older man.  Older gentleman.  Why don't you just have some dignity?  It's like that old piece of chicken.  It's just not hanging.  Play an elder statesman.  There you go.  All right.  Well, what else is he going to do?  His movie career stinks, so he has to go back to the well. 
[01:21:30]  But that's why.  It's like if he would stop.  Nighthawks 2.  Yes.  I think we talked about this before.  He was just amazing in Copland.  And no one expected freaking Sly Stallone to be in that type of movie and pull it off.  Completely stepped out of character.  Yeah.  You know?  He just was a weak guy.  He was fat.  A little dim-witted.  Why not do that again?  People, your movie career is dying because everyone is tired of it. 
[01:22:00]  It's embarrassing.  There's younger guys.  Nobody wants to see at your age a Rambo character or some other tired rehashing.  We're sick of it.  Yeah.  It'll do well at the box office.  I hope it bombs miserably.  The review is going to be beyond awful for it.  What?  Oh, crap.  Thank the Lord.  Roland, make it fast because we got a hot story for that GM.  Fighting.  There's boxing. 
[01:22:30]  What do you know about Sweet Potato?  Just where he comes out of retirement because they do a generated game that he wins.  What?  He comes out of retirement, Rocky.  Because they do a computer-generated game that shows that he wins.  And then he comes back to fight the guy.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, there's a computer-generated game that shows he will win the fight.  Yeah.  Well, who wins this fight in the movie?  Please ruin it if you know the answer.  Ruin it.  And then the guy in the video game that loses to Rocky probably, you know, has a press card. 
[01:23:00]  He's like, ah, it's just a game.  I'd kick his ass in real life.  And then Rocky's like, oh, hell.  You can do it.  Huh?  And then someone says, you can do it, Rock.  Dad, don't do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Then he starts training.  Yeah, yeah.  Someone will say, don't do it.  And he'll be like, you know, someone else used to tell me, just do it and go for it.  That was Adrian.  And I'm going to go for it. 
[01:23:30]  And then E-Rock, there's going to be a training montage.  Oh, sorry.  He's lifting colostomy bags.  He's got, like, a long bar with just two white orthopedic shoes on the end of his sickio.  That's him.  But Adrian, yeah.  I can't do Rocky, obviously.  But Adrian ain't here because her corpse is riding on the ground.  He'll be lifting her coffin over his head, doing curls with his head.  Stupid.  But Bugs are eating out her eyeballs. 
[01:24:00]  But I got to go on for her.  I hope Butkus is dead, too.  I hated Butkus.  Butkus.  Dumb dog.  My dog.  I was thinking maybe we could go to the zoo or something.  Why, yeah.  Retard.  Pauly has prostate cancer and Butkus is dead.  Someone is reminding us that Burt Young said that this is the last movie, and he said that on our show.  Oh, exclusive.  They also said the third one would be the last and the fourth one and the fifth, whatever.  No, it's not.  I'm going to bite the computer screen if that's right. 
[01:24:30]  Eric just showed me on the monitor.  Stallone has coming out Rambo 4, Pearl of the Cobra.  How about this, Pearl of the Cobra.  And you're wearing it, older gentleman.  By the way, 2008 still has a little over a year to go.  It's got to be a lie.  That's part of the deal for Rocky.  Why?  Pearl of the Cobra.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who is he fighting?  I don't know.  The Taliban?  His inner demons.  If they want him to make Rocky, he said, I'll make Rocky if I can make Rambo. 
[01:25:00]  What?  Who wanted him to make Rocky?  What faggity young executive who has no creativity wanted him to make Rocky?  I don't know.  Jimmy has passion when he has it.  Dude, I'm sick of it.  Oh, my God.  I'm sick of the rehash crap.  Pearl of the Cobra.  I never liked the first Rambos.  I'm the only guy.  I know.  I just thought they stunk.  I liked Rambo when it came out.  Everyone did.  It was for the time.  Yeah, it doesn't hold up anymore, but I thought it was good.  A lot of body bags.  John Rambo. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, but that was Hollywood back then where they had to go with the dramatic catchphrases  and stuff.  I'd bring one thing.  What's that?  A lot of body bags.  Body bags.  What they did in the 80s is every movie was written.  The character was talked about the way you would want people to talk about you.  Like, you don't want to get on his bad side.  Like, every faggity character in the 80s had people discussing him the way I wish people  would talk about me.  Norton's coming.  What do you need?  A lot of body bags. 
[01:26:00]  You drew first blood.  First blood.  Shut up.  Oh, there it is.  Jimmy, if you would read the plot to Rambo 4, Pearl of the Cobra.  John Rambo has been living a secluded lifestyle in Bangkok.  Oh, we know what he's doing.  Bangkok.  Secluded lifestyle in Bangkok.  In Bangkok.  And salvaging old boats and tanks for scrap for 12 years.  After computer file trading with...  No.  But when a group of volunteer aid workers bring supplies into Burma disappear, a relative 
[01:26:30]  of one of the missing missionaries begs Rambo to find them.  He heads off with a small team of aspiring heroes to locate and rescue them.  And so it's some aid workers.  And they can't get local police to help, apparently.  I don't know why.  Maybe they're all eating elephant tusks, putting pepper on them.  So they have to get John Rambo.  And I'm sure he so reluctantly accepts this.  Like, I'm just, you know, I'm just salvaging the tanks and boats and stuff. 
[01:27:00]  And I don't do this anymore.  There's going to be a whole scene, I don't do that anymore.  There ain't that John Rambo's dead.  And then something will happen where he has to go and do this.  And he decides, you know, he's going to kick ass.  You know why?  Because he's in love with a young Bangkok woman.  And she so happens to be part of it.  Right.  It's going to involve a woman.  Where he's like, she's missing.  And you know what will happen when he gets all his weapons together?  It'll be done in montage. 
[01:27:30]  She can call him Locky by mistake.  Locky.  And Lambo.  Locky.  Stupid.  Is that the Rambo music?  Yeah, it's Rambo music, all right.  All right, I'll go in.  I'll go in for you.  Another bad movie name.  He'll have the Rambo knife.  He'll have a lot of the.  As he loads up all his weapons.  All that clicking noise. 
[01:28:00]  Stop.  It'll be filled with catchphrases, though.  When have you ever put a knife in a sheath and it's going.  You know what?  I can't wait for the new Rocky movie.  And I can't wait for the new Rambo movie.  Yeah, who's not going to see it?  Because we'll have a lot of fun with those movies when they come out.  How about another Cobra?  Marion Cabretti is coming back.  Marion Cabretti.  Stupid ass.  You're the disease.  And now we know.  Hey.  Marion Cabretti. 
[01:28:30]  Hey, yeah, we got to teach.  Douchebag.  We got to teach Matt in Detroit something here.  Matt, go ahead.  Hey, I heard that this Rocky movie is actually pretty good from the guys that come on after you here.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  We're in Detroit.  Who comes on after us in Detroit?  Yeah, what is it?  The Stallone and Burt Young show?  Huh?  Jay and Michelle.  But how do they know the movie's good?  Jay worked for Fox News down here and he does like all the movies and entertainment stories.  Oh, so he actually saw the movie.  Okay.  Yeah, and he said it. 
[01:29:00]  He takes all the best emotions from the first couple and like it just wraps them up again in it.  Of course it does.  You mean the hilarity of Mickey's death?  Does it take that funny moment with the joy of watching that idiot fall in Rocky 3 and get his teeth knocked out by a young black buck?  That's how the film should have ended.  That faggity montage of music.  Eye of the Tiger.  And then he gets his teeth knocked out.  And then Mickey dies.  And we all have a big laugh.  And people are like, wow, the film was over in 41 minutes. 
[01:29:30]  How convenient.  All right, well, there's someone that, you know, knows someone that saw the movie and then they're saying it's a good flick.  It's all people talking about you the way you want them to talk.  It's so.  That is really funny.  I can't wait till the class.  Wow.  All right.  Listen, we got to move on because we got Chubby Bunny with E-Rock.  And we also have a story that might make that GM.  Everyone's trying to figure out who this GM is, by the way.  Everybody is trying to figure out what GM we talked to at the manager's meeting in Boca Raton. 
[01:30:00]  I can't get away from his raging one.  And he was talking about his raging, uh-uh.  And he thinks we need to do more stuff that gives him a raging, uh-uh, on this fine radio show.  So we got a hot story that might get a little, you know what, flowing.  A little saucy?  Yeah.  We might help out this GM today.  Do you want to?  You creep.  I want to help out.  You creep. 
[01:30:30]  Swollen and turgid.  You creep.  And I couldn't get out of the car until the segment was done.  I bet you couldn't.  Yeah, well.  Skin was pulled tight.  Just a creep.  That reminds me.  I want to grab some of the sausage over there.  Look.  Could I just leave trying to eat?  Look, we talked to a lot.  It was a dinner, for God's sake, that I was getting at, by the way.  Yeah.  And, uh, like I couldn't get away.  We talked.  Get away to eat.  Here's the deal.  Let's do a little experiment.  We talk to a lot of guys every morning.  The show is known to be very popular with men. 
[01:31:00]  Men.  In your life, do you ever talk about having a rock?  Yeah, well, no.  All right.  No, I don't.  You talk around the actual physical part of what happens to you.  You could say, she was hot and I was turned on.  That's about as far as you would go.  Yeah, you don't get into graphic description with other guys.  You don't have to say the word in front of your friends.  Unless describing the word because it happened at a bad time. 
[01:31:30]  Like, then it's okay.  Like, you know what I mean?  I was raging and, you know, I was babysitting.  You know, whatever it is.  Right.  We're slow dancing with my grandmother.  That could be bad.  Yeah.  And it's funny.  Yeah, but to actually just, you know, describe in detail what's going on with your body because  of what you hear on the radio or because you saw some hot chick at the office.  Guys just don't talk like that unless you're a creep.  Oh, my God.  Are we not going to be able to do the marshmallow chubby bunny? 
[01:32:00]  Why?  I mean, I mean, before we have to actually.  No, we'll do it.  What?  Who?  I thought we were going to do it.  Yeah, we'll do it.  When?  Right now?  Well, we got to take a, you know, a little thing out of here.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  Jimmy had to talk about Rocky and Rambo and it was a fine rant.  I enjoyed his little review.  But guess what?  Now there's a backup on the highway here, okay?  We'll figure it out.  We'll get one of these cars out of the way.  If Eric's having a problem with the marshmallows, I have something raging that I'll help you 
[01:32:30]  just to push more marshmallows down.  You're going to break that record, son.  How do you like this conversation, you creep?  Ghoul.  And then he asked, hey, I'm blah, blah years old and I F anything that moves or I like  to F in.  All right, we get it.  You're a man.  All right.  Yeah, this is a great story, though.  Hoaxer convinces McDonald's worker to sexually assault coworker.  It's a terrific story. 
[01:33:00]  A hoaxer?  A hoaxer.  I applied to be one of those.  That was a hoaxer.  I know.  We're going to find out next and we're also going to do the chubby bunny thing as well.  Chubby bunny.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December  21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los  Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[01:33:30]  O and A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Do it like this.  Chubby bunny.  Yeah, baby, Vinny.  I feel like I'm doing a contest.  Chubby food. 
[01:34:00]  It's always fun to try to eat breakfast within eight minutes.  Yeah, it's part of the gig.  What a pain in the ass.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The only virus spreading across America.  E-Rock.  In this room.  Is making his way to this part of the studio with his marshmallows.  What kind of marshmallows?  Are they the typical, nice, good brand?  Oh, no.  Oh, what a shop.  Shop, right? 
[01:34:30]  It sounds laughing at him.  Like, isn't there a name brand marshmallow?  It's like a name brand.  It's like really the ones I used to get as a kid, I remember.  Does it really matter where you get marshmallows from?  Nah, I guess they're all the same.  They've got to be the same crap.  But they had a nice little dusting of powdery sugar on them.  I never liked them.  Marshmallows are just forget about sugar rush you're going to get.  Oof.  E-Rock, you ready for the chubby bunny?  Ready as I can be.  When we were in West Palm Beach, it came to our attention that some lady died at a county fair 
[01:35:00]  because she was doing the chubby bunny contest.  Who knew how popular these things were?  Chubby bunny.  And our own Sam, his mom won a very important chubby bunny contest as part of the Girl Scouts that Sam was part of.  I heard it was followed up with a little disappointment, though, that you lost the three-legged race.  That happened.  The potato sack race.  Oh, a little bit of Americana, your family. 
[01:35:30]  Thomas Jefferson's ancestors, Boy Scouts.  I just hope there was a molestation in there.  Yeah, you've got to help.  Break up the whole healthy lifestyle thing.  It's got a hell of a family tree there.  All right, so.  A little small.  What, do they smell a little funny to you?  I haven't had more fellows in years, so I wasn't really.  Dip them in mayo, make it easier to win your mouth.  We should have got a few dips for him, right, man.  That's really funny.  All right, well, people are betting at home.  The contest is really simple, and this should only take a few minutes, hopefully, so we can get back to the funny and the hotness of the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:36:00]  We do now have a benchmark, kind of a number to gauge it on.  Yeah.  To Sam's mom.  Had how many?  23.  23 she was able to do.  Wow, there's no confidence.  But in a contest environment.  Right.  You know, she was pitted against other competitors, and she had to say, chubby bunny, and then put a marshmallow in, chubby bunny, and the last person that's able to put the last marshmallow in their mouth without spitting them out or choking or dying or something like that, they win, and she won with 23. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  So, she doing 23, how many think E-Rock can do?  Seven.  Seven?  I give him 14.  I'm giving, um, I'm going to give you an even 20.  I think you could do 20.  You got kind of, you got kind of a chipmunky cheek thing going.  Tim goes 14, Ant goes 20.  I think the marshmallows also kind of can compress really well. 
[01:37:00]  Wait, what do we have here if Casey chokes?  I mean, besides.  Nothing.  Nothing.  His fingers.  Yeah.  Someone else that wants his job.  His fingers and time.  Yeah.  Yeah, but what if he, I don't want to see him chug.  We got him.  Heimlich.  Get Kenny in here or something.  Heimlich him.  All right.  Heimlich him.  All right, listen.  The boys don't have confidence in this little bit because I don't see any cameras.  Oh, there's the camera.  There's Sam's camera.  The camera was hiding behind his monitor there. 
[01:37:30]  I thought Sam decided not to break out the camera.  What?  A little communique?  Oh, the Paltalk camera?  All right, well.  Kenny, do you know how to do the Heimlich?  Yes.  Okay.  I can do first aid.  All right.  He's not going to choke.  I'm sure he's not, but I worry about him.  He's a sweet boy.  Just be careful.  Keep them away from, you know, the back of your throat.  What can we tell you?  Exactly.  The place that you usually like someone to hit when their hands are on your head.  That's how an ambulance gets here. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  Here we go.  So it's the Chubby Bunny.  Well, we usually try this out in the Opie and Anthony lab, but for this one, we decided  to just do it live on the air and see what happens, okay?  Can you say Chubby Bunny with that one?  Chubby Bunny.  Chubby.  This is the way we're saying Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  Can you give us a scream at the end of this contest?  Well, you got the marshmallows in your mouth?  After 10, could you yell frunkus?  All right.  Here we go.  So at your own pace there, E-Rock, and we'll count. 
[01:38:30]  Chubby Bunny.  Oh, you're finished.  You really are finished.  Chubby Bunny.  Idiot, you are.  Chubby Bunny.  That's a three.  He's not going to make anywhere near 14.  Chubby Bunny.  That's four, I believe.  You are a fool.  Chubby Bunny.  Five.  Five.  Chubby Bunny. 
[01:39:00]  Do you have any saliva in your mouth?  Sand face?  Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny, yeah.  Your technique stinks.  Yeah.  You got to squash him down or something.  You're running out of room fast.  Say it or I'll punch your stomach.  Chubby Bunny.  That's all he ate.  Chubby Bunny.  Oh, you small mouth.  Turn to Sam a little bit when you do this. 
[01:39:30]  How do you keep a boyfriend?  Make him laugh.  He's going to choke.  Is this number 10 coming in?  I don't know.  Nine.  Nine?  Nine.  This is nine?  Incompetent.  This is 10.  Oh, it's hurting him.  Good.  Jimmy, you're going to win, man. 
[01:40:00]  How many?  11.  We think it's 11, yeah.  Is 11 going in?  He's having a hard time breathing out of his nose.  This is funnier than I thought it would be.  Oh, is that 12?  Yeah, I think so.  I think it was lucky 13.  Stupid sinuses.  Oh, he's gagging.  He's gagging.  He's gagging. 
[01:40:30]  One more, you incompetent.  Jimmy.  Frog neck.  Jimmy so wins.  Jimmy said 14.  Oh, oh, oh, no.  Say it.  Oh, he's gagging.  I don't think he's going to get this one.  Yes, he will.  Oh, there he goes.  It's over.  All right.  It's over.  He gagged. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  13.  Wow.  13 and a half.  13?  Jimmy wins.  Easily.  Yeah, I can only sense how many marshmallows a young man is going to put in his mouth.  Yeah.  We've got to get one more person to do this.  Chubby bunny after 30.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Bunny who's chubby.  Steve would never flounder.  We would love to have one more person do this.  I mean, I would go for the obvious choices, either Steve or club sort of Kenny, but I don't  know if we're going to get either one to do it.  No, because who's going to heimlich Kenny?  I'm scared. 
[01:41:30]  Are you scared?  Yeah, I'm not doing that.  You're not doing that?  I'm not doing that.  Mic phone.  Your mic's on.  So something dangerous.  Yeah.  I'd rather get punched in the face than.  Well, we can accommodate you.  Yeah.  No, it's like about Harry dying.  He choked on marshmallows.  Yeah.  Rowan.  You go out like a hero.  Rowan.  That's a chubby bunny.  Rowan.  Rowan.  Rowan.  Rowan.  How about this?  If you do chubby bunny, or I'll treat you like Chloe, whatever her name is, in brown 
[01:42:00]  bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby.  What are you talking to thin air for?  Roll with a mic.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby.  I guess I'll do it.  Yeah.  I guess so.  Hey, people liking the contest.  Marion in New York City.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  That is so funny.  You've got to hold an official contest.  I mean, the guys, you could put them in a ring.  You could have them wearing bunny ears.  Oh, bunnies. 
[01:42:30]  It's so funny.  How about this?  People are saying Rowan can't talk without marshmallows in his mouth.  Girls.  All right.  They like it.  How about.  Chubby.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Should we have girls show up tomorrow, maybe if you think you could be 13?  That'd be nice.  Your mom did 23?  That's amazing.  Were they the mini marshmallows?  That you put in a cup of hot cocoa?  Your mom's a good egg.  Hey.  Jesus.  She certainly is.  I got to handle this phone call, unfortunately.  I'm sorry, Anthony. 
[01:43:00]  Chad in Green Bay.  Yes.  Yes.  Hey, Opie.  I was wondering, since we've got marshmallows in the studio, want to try a round of Bomb  the DK House?  Oh, that's when Opie took marshmallows and had to put them in a certain part of his anatomy  that would hold a marshmallow.  Without using my hands.  Without his hands, of course.  And walk over a replica of another frat house and drop it like a bomber. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, man.  I just wanted to drink the beer.  What can I tell you?  You know, keg parties.  That's all I heard.  I think for the PalTalk camera, they're annoyed at the placement of the microphone.  It's hard to see your mouth.  Yeah.  So if you could, no, not down.  It would have to be, like, twist it.  How about we get a better camera angle, too?  No, the other way.  Yes, Sam.  Maybe behind Anthony a little bit, if Anthony will allow you to get close to him.  Of course.  All right.  Of course I would.  Sam has to get his camera in a better location.  My camera.  Roland, do you think you can beat E-Rock's new record? 
[01:44:00]  I don't know.  I give Roland nine.  Nine?  Nine.  I think this kid is going to be a good competitor.  No, he's not.  He has a face like somebody in a Blondie cartoon.  He's absolutely not.  All right.  Let's hear you say Chubby Bunny, first of all.  Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  It's a Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny is a bunny.  It's a story about a bunny, and he ate too much, and he got a Chubby, Chubby Bunny. 
[01:44:30]  Sam, you know your mom's a size queen, right?  Oh, God.  Everyone's saying it.  Why did you say it, Opie?  Everyone's saying it.  Everyone's saying it.  Absolutely.  But everyone's saying it.  She was throwing him up and catching him.  Oh, Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  She did it with softballs.  Oh.  Hey, I just got to acknowledge what's coming in, Anthony.  Is it true she wanted the marshmallows dyed black, though, before she would even participate?  Yes, and the guy had to hold her hair by her pigtails.  She wanted him toasted over a campfire first.  And it wasn't Chubby, she said before Bunny. 
[01:45:00]  People are saying that E-Rock did 14, not 13, that we lost count there somewhere.  Really?  I don't know.  Go back to the tape.  Listen to the replay.  All right, here we go.  It's Roland doing the Chubby Bunny.  Chubby, Chubby, Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  All right, very good.  There's one.  There's one.  Chubby Bunny.  Good Godfather.  He's using, yeah, he's using the Vito Corleone technique.  Cheeks first.  Chubby Bunny.  That's three.  By number three, there's already one sticking out.  Roland is awful at this. 
[01:45:30]  What a boob.  Be careful.  You know that tongue takes up too much room.  That's why I can't talk right.  There's no room in that mouth.  Chubby Bunny.  No, he has a small stupid mouth.  Chubby Bunny?  He just asked a question.  Chubby Bunny?  That's only four, by the way.  No, he's awful.  That's almost five.  Have you ever eaten before?  Oh, he spit them all out.  Sorry.  Oh, that was funny.  It was worth it, though.  He didn't get the whole food in the mouth thing. 
[01:46:00]  He's shoving a marshmallow in, and it's just like filling back up with air and popping out.  Will you take charge already?  Did you see where he tried to shove one marshmallow?  I swear.  He tried to shove it between his teeth and his upper lip.  I was looking at him shoving it in.  I go, that's not going to fit.  Zach, would you have wisdom teeth out?  It's not gauze, you moron.  It's jaw.  Roland did five.  No, you have four, and the fifth one fell out of his dumb mouth.  Does anyone else want to try?  Roland only dates Asian men.  Danny's always good.  Oh, Craig will do it. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  Hey, listen, really fast.  Yes.  Very good idea.  I can't read his name on the instant feedback, but he's from FBA, which is also known as OAExperience.com.  I think we need to do Chubby Vag tomorrow.  I couldn't agree more.  That's where this contest is going to end up.  You know that.  You might have to start with Chubby Baby or Chubby Bunny or anything else chubby.  And then when their mouth gets full, they can switch to whatever they want.  Right.  And it would kind of almost be like a Kenny from South Park thing. 
[01:47:00]  Like, we ought to wait until their mouth is really full and have them say awful things that you could not say on the radio.  Hey, that's a great idea.  Because you can't understand what he's saying.  We'll just hold up signs.  Yeah.  That's a great idea.  We'll try it with Craig right now.  Yeah, let's try it with Craig.  Make sure you get a few in there.  All right.  This is Craig.  I need a pen.  He's a good sport.  He's done a lot of great stuff for this radio show.  Craig's a good kid.  All right.  Let's see if this works.  Let's get Nosferatu in here.  Tony, he just won Chubby Bunny. 
[01:47:30]  Chubby Bunny.  Little fang marks in every marshmallow.  No, he'll just hang his teeth out and then put them on the fangs like lifesavers.  He sucks that marshmallow-y goodness out of it, and it just leaves a dry, powdery thing in his mouth.  By the way.  100.  By the way, a lot of people are saying we should get Big A to do it.  We tried.  He couldn't get off work today, so maybe he'll come in tomorrow or Friday.  All right.  Chuh, chuh, chuh, chuh.  One.  He'll either do one or 400.  I can't tell. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Listen.  Jason from Buffalo.  How many Chubby Bunnies can All the Way May get in her mouth?  Oh, All the Way May.  She can get full rabbits.  Nothing stops All the Way May.  And she doesn't just take them in her mouth.  Chubby rhinoceros.  All right.  This is Craig, our intern.  Are we keeping you?  Yeah?  You get to stay?  All right.  Made the cut.  All right.  Here's Craig and Chubby Bunny.  Say Chubby Bunny before a marshmallow.  Chubby Bunny.  There you go.  All right.  Here we go.  First one in. 
[01:48:30]  Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  You've got elastic cheeks.  This boy is going to be impressive.  I'll give him 17.  Chubby Bunny.  Don't make him laugh.  Yeah, don't laugh, stupid.  Uh-oh.  Chubby Bunny.  He's actually getting the B.  Yeah.  It's the first thing that goes is the B.  Chubby Bunny.  How many is that, sweetie?  Five a thing?  Oh.  Uh, this is going on sex.  Okay.  What a mouth this kid has. 
[01:49:00]  Chubby Bunny.  He's laughing.  No laughing.  Stop it.  We'll kill you.  Chubby Bunny.  All right.  It's starting to affect his speech.  Don't laugh.  Concentrate.  Don't laugh.  You can do it.  Concentrate.  Chubby Bunny.  You started so strong, and now you're just nose diving. 
[01:49:30]  Don't, don't, don't.  Just keep working it.  Don't swallow.  Chubby Bunny.  Okay.  He's back.  He's repositioned.  We're at nine.  This is ten.  Okay.  Chubby Bunny.  Oh, you got better.  You got to beat E-Rock at least.  Come on.  Yeah, no one wants E-Rock to have the record.  Chubby Bunny.  That's 11.  Okay.  Should have given him 15. 
[01:50:00]  I'm dumb.  Oh.  That one's tough.  What number is that?  All right.  Okay.  Twelve.  Start writing.  Try not to spit out after this one, because I think after this one, we're going to have  you say dirty stuff.  Concentrate.  All right.  Perfect.  Okay.  Hold it in.  Hold it in.  All right.  Hold it in.  We got dirty things for you to say now.  All right.  All right.  Ready?  No, no.  Grab another. 
[01:50:30]  We're still playing.  Yeah, they're still playing.  It's a ton.  Good.  Drop.  Get it in there.  Wait.  This is 14?  Yeah.  Let's start with something easy.  Okay.  This is for the record.  Yeah.  The O.P.  Anthony record.  Say Chubby Bunny first.  Make sure.  Boop, boop, boop.  Oh, he's getting better.  Oh, see?  Okay.  Try this.  Okay.  Try this.  Keep it in there. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  All right.  Let's see if that got through.  Of course it did.  Did it?  Can't send a word of it.  We got to find out if Al dumped out of that.  If you're just tuning in, we got Craig.  He's got 14 or 15.  Give him another marshmallow.  Yeah.  Marshmallows.  Oh, he can't?  How about this?  We're holding up the really dirty things for him to say.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. 
[01:51:30]  What?  It didn't go through?  Oh, it did.  Okay.  Oh, both went through.  No, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here.  Do this one.  Yeah.  We are writing really dirty things.  Point the balcony first.  Don't laugh.  Come on.  It's holding up what we're having Craig say on the pal talk cameras so they can play along 
[01:52:00]  at home.  Oh, he's a little longer.  Oh, screw it.  Hold on.  Come on.  Don't worry.  I got, I got one.  Oh.  Don't spit it out.  All right.  Craig is going to say something really dirty with 15 marshmallows in his mouth. 
[01:52:30]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Okay.  Here you go.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Oh, well.  What is it?  Did that one get dumped out of?  Did I dump out of that one?  Ow.  Ow.  The last word was a little rough.  I got one. 
[01:53:00]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Here.  Hold that up to the camera.  Anthony.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  Maybe give him a reprieve.  He looks like he's really having a hard time here.  You want to go?  I got one.  Hold on.  I got one for you.  He's putting another marshmallow in.  How many is that?  16?  Just nod.  15?  16?  16?  No, I just nod.  Just nod. 
[01:53:30]  15?  How about this, Craig?  15?  16?  Craig, can you say this?  Good job.  Ruzzle dazzle.  Ruzzle dazzle.  Yeah, we should have put the dirty words on the pad data for the XMers.  Oh, yeah.  But they don't know what's being said either, because they're in another building right now.  Plus, he's stolen one anyway.  One more?  Look at you.  Grand finale.  Think up something really heinous. 
[01:54:00]  Look at you.  Oh, he's just spitting out.  Don't act like you've never had this happen before.  Well, what a gentleman you are.  All right.  Peer you are.  We're going for one more.  How many do you have so far?  He'll tell us after he spits it out.  He's keeping track.  I think it's like 16 or 17, somewhere in there.  16?  Yeah.  You want to throw another one in there?  One more.  Come on.  You can do it, son.  That gives me the record.  All right.  Say Chubby Bunny, by the way, to make it official.  He's got like 17 marshmallows. 
[01:54:30]  Chubby Bunny.  He's wiping off his mouth because he's drooling like crazy.  Oh, wow.  I don't think it's any worse than the one that's holding up.  Craig is going to say probably the dirtiest thing you could say.  You can do it.  You can do it.  I caught that one.  Was that a little too close, Al?  Do we know if Al dumped out? 
[01:55:00]  I don't know.  That's fun.  All right.  Are you going for another one?  It's a fun game.  He's going for another one.  Chubby Bunny, yes.  I hate the way his lips are just wrapping around going, Chubby Bunny.  Oh, I know.  His lips are just talking.  Oh, it's coming out like a...  I know.  What's this?  Splash it on your back, son.  Let's go to Carol in Baldwin.  Carol.  Hey.  Hey, Carol. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  You know, you're making real fun about this, but I had an uncle, five years old.  Went to the corner store, bought a marshmallow, choked on it.  Paramedics, nobody could get it out of his throat because it goes down your throat and your body is warm.  And it doesn't turn into sap, and it doesn't turn into sap.  It killed him.  And his mother was shaking him up and down by the ankles.  Yeah, that's how you do it.  Wait, what happened to your uncle?  He died.  Oh, she hung up. 
[01:56:00]  Why did you just take a breath?  Yeah, she hung up.  She didn't really appreciate it.  One marshmallow?  What a stupid uncle.  Yeah.  What?  I think he was just saying something to her.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  This is like Kenny from South Park.  Maybe we ought to let him get rid of that.  He's easier to understand than Stephen Hawking, I'll say that.  All right.  Are you done there, Craig?  Yeah, let her rip.  All right.  You can spit. 
[01:56:30]  Go.  Oh, God.  That's a lot of marshmallows.  It's just marshmallows.  How many did you do?  I fit 17.  17.  There we go.  And said a lot of really, really dirty things.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's how we get around the FCC.  We'll do our whole show with marshmallows shoved in our mouths.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  When we get back, the hoaxer.  Uh, convinces McDonald's worker to sexually assault a co-worker.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I love showing my b***h introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[01:57:00]  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  All right.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to remind people that MacBook karaoke is happening.  Go to 923freefm.com.  That's 923freefm.com for all the details.  You can win the new MacBook, sleek and sexy.  And it has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities.  Head to the Apple store or apple.com to check it out. 
[01:57:30]  It's MacBook karaoke.  I want to hear some of these.  Absolutely.  Come on.  Go to 923freefm.com for all the details.  Do we have enough time to get into this hoaxer?  We've been talking about it off and on all morning.  I want to hear how this guy hoaxed somebody.  All right.  Let's get right into it.  Into doing this.  In a back office at McDonald's in Mount Washington, Kentucky,  Teenager Louise Ogborn is naked and in tears.  Donna Summers, the assistant manager who had strip searched her,  has to get back to work. 
[01:58:00]  The caller had suggested she bring in her fiancé, Walter Nix,  who goes by the name Wes.  This 43-year-old exterminator is about to continue the interrogation.  You left this middle-aged man with a naked, frightened...  She was covered.  ...with an apron.  She was completely covered.  But as the video shows, Louise is tugging at the apron,  which barely covers her top,  and the sides of her legs are exposed up to her buttocks. 
[01:58:30]  As you can see, is there a video?  Yeah, where's the video?  Come on, share it, friends.  Please share it.  Danny, what's going on with this?  Well, the video is up on, I think it's ABC's website here in New York.  Yeah.  Some pranks, and apparently he'd been doing this for like 10 years,  was calling, posing as a police officer,  saying that someone, one of your workers had shoplifted a purse or something,  and he went direct, like, managing, you know, management,  to discipline these employees. 
[01:59:00]  What dopes.  I strip searched them.  And because they thought it was actually a police officer,  they were afraid not to do what the guy on the line said,  so they would do it.  This guy should get an award.  Yeah.  How does...  Genius.  How does he get off?  He stays on the phone?  Yeah.  For the whole process?  Yeah, he gets off.  Because he doesn't get to see the video, but I guess he uses his imagination.  He gets to hear some sounds, too.  He had them...  This chick plays over a couple of hours.  The girl's in the office.  He had a manager, Donna Summer, her name is.  Donna Summer.  Yes.  Could you slow down a little bit, Jimmy?  There's a GM out there that's really, really, really enjoying this. 
[01:59:30]  Worked up.  He's worked up.  It's a frothy frenzy.  He got her to tell the girl to take off her clothes and, I guess, put on the apron and  bend over.  And the woman had to go back to work.  So he made her go get somebody else to bring them in to watch the girl.  So they bring in one other employee who won't do it.  And he said no.  So then the guy says, call your fiance.  So she calls her fiance.  That's the guy who they said it was whatever his name was.  Shows up.  He watches it.  And then the guy directs him to search the girl and then perform a sex act on her. 
[02:00:00]  And the guy did it.  How would the sex act fit into this investigation?  Made her do jumping jacks in case anything was up there to fall.  Like anything was in her mouth or whatever.  Fall out her nose.  Well, let's get into it.  We got some more audio here.  More to the story.  It's the height of the dinner rush.  Donna Summers leaves the 90-pound teenager alone and vulnerable in the office with a 230-pound  Nix.  Why couldn't you run out? 
[02:00:30]  I was naked.  I was scared.  I mean, any normal person in the situation, they wouldn't have ran out.  You're convinced there's no way you could have done it?  There's no way.  Did you think about it?  I wanted to so bad I wanted to run.  You've done a year.  You have to have run through the restaurant.  I couldn't have done that.  I couldn't have ran out the back door.  I couldn't have done anything. 
[02:01:00]  I couldn't bring myself to humiliate and so forth than I already was.  The fact that you got naked in an office at McDonald's, you are as dumb as they come.  She really is.  By the way, this girl is of age.  That's smart.  She's 18.  She's not a kid.  She was 18, so.  She's just stupid.  Why would you, if they stole a purse and you let somebody bend you over, strip search  shoe and make you do all this embarrassing jumping, why would you do it?  How ignorant are people of the law?  Well, this is just in from Internet Stalker from Roxbury, Massachusetts. 
[02:01:30]  The GM has a chubby bunny as he drives his car to work.  I can't find the video.  It's really hot.  I'm sure.  Let's say hi to Carl in Jersey as you look for that video.  And Carl, what's up?  Hey, I saw this video, and this girl is as dumb as the day is long, my friend.  Is she pretty?  She is a retard.  But is she pretty?  I swear, I told my daughter, if anybody ever asked you, you'd come call my father.  This girl's retarded.  How could you get undressed? 
[02:02:00]  Because somebody said there's a cop on the phone.  How dumb is the manager, Donna Summer, for believing it?  Oh, my goodness.  And how far has Donna Summer fallen over the years?  Jesus.  Pop diva to the.  The manager of a McDonald's.  Yeah.  Well, you know what it was?  They said that she worked hard for the money.  Here's the clip about the jumping jacks.  Humiliation, as it turns out, would be the least of her worries.  Now it's Walter Nix who's following the caller's commands,  having Louise drop her apron, bend over, stand on a chair. 
[02:02:30]  Then, as ridiculous as it sounds, he tells Louise to jog and do jumping jacks.  To shake loose anything, the caller says.  That she might be hiding.  Yeah.  Incredibly, Nix complies with the caller's outlandish demands.  And it's only the beginning of two more hours of torment.  Why did you follow their instructions?  My parents taught me, when an adult tells you to do something, that's what you do. 
[02:03:00]  That's good parenting.  You don't argue.  You know, somebody smacks you on the hand.  You listen.  I doubt they meant that, though.  Yeah.  Jogging place in the McDonald's office.  Yeah.  To shake loose something you didn't steal.  When did you learn that lesson as a kid?  And by the way, at 18, you're an adult, idiot.  Yeah.  Lawyer up.  She is dumb.  But I tell you one thing, I am being affected by this.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's hot.  Mm-hmm.  And the guy who impersonated the police officer, you can't impersonate a cop, but why should 
[02:03:30]  he get in trouble?  Because people are stupid enough to buy it.  He's great.  So Jimmy was affected by this.  Yes.  See, that's all you have to say.  You don't have to describe it in detail.  Stories from, like, November 30th, though.  Yeah, that's why the video isn't up.  YouTube?  Perhaps.  Probably.  No, not YouTube.  They don't do sexy stuff.  Oh, right.  They stay away from the sexy stuff.  Let's move on with the audio here.  According to Louise, when she fails to address Walter Nix as sir, the caller tells him to 
[02:04:00]  hit her violently on the buttocks over and over.  Here, it goes on for almost 10 minutes.  He told me that I was asking too many questions, so he was told to hit me.  And I said, please don't do this.  This is so ridiculous.  This is stupid.  Please don't.  But that would only make him hit you harder.  Oh, listen to the creeper.  Yeah.  But that only made him hit you harder. 
[02:04:30]  Hit you harder, didn't it?  Right?  It hurt, but it kind of felt good, didn't it?  Oh, good, right.  Did it tell me?  You like that, don't you?  Right.  You are such a dirty girl.  Listen to him.  The girl you are.  Listen again.  Please don't.  But that would only make him hit you harder.  Yes.  That's the voice you do when you try not to show your excitement.  But that would only hit you harder.  Should bring your slacks to the dry cleaner. 
[02:05:00]  Please don't.  But that would only make him hit you harder.  Yes, and more times.  Yes, and more times.  By the end of the beating, painful red welts appear clearly on Louise's body.  Nice.  And during it all, Donna Summers keeps walking in and out of the office.  Every time you hear her coming in, what happens?  He throws an apron at me and tells me, like, shh.  Don't tell Donna.  When you walked into the office, what would you see between her and Walter? 
[02:05:30]  She was sitting on one side.  He was sitting on the other.  They weren't saying a whole lot.  And she was covered.  And she was covered up all the time.  But there's at least one occasion when Summers comes in before Nix throws the apron over Louise.  Uh-oh.  When we try to show Donna Summers the videotape, you say you didn't see her without her clothes on, but there she is.  And you walk.  Okay, we're not going to answer questions about that.  She can't talk about this?  No, no.  Summers' attorney, who's off camera, won't allow her to respond.  Ah, look at this.  Hey, scumbag lawyer. 
[02:06:00]  This is coming in like crazy.  Doug in Arkansas, go ahead.  Yeah, I heard that caller ask that little girl what color panties she's wearing, because Donna wants to know.  Yeah, everyone's doing freaking...  Oh, that's...  Everyone's doing sound bites from our classic Donna Summers prank call.  Ah, very good.  All right.  By the way, someone is saying the video's up on break.com.  Oh, is it?  Cool.  But I don't know how you search for it, so maybe someone can help us out with the search part of that.  I'm scared.  All right, it goes on.  Well, she went numb, Jimmy. 
[02:06:30]  Aw.  Why didn't you tell Donna at that point?  I begged her every time she came in the room, get me out of here.  Please, get me out of here.  Donna, please.  Please.  I didn't do anything wrong.  Please leave me.  And she puts her head on your shoulder, and she told us she was saying to you, please help me.  No, she didn't.  Please.  That's not what she said.  Couldn't you feel her head on your shoulder?  Uh, I don't recall that particular incident. 
[02:07:00]  I don't...  She says she's begging you to rescue her.  She never said that to me.  And every time Summers walks out of the office, Louise says Nix resumes and intensifies her torture.  Of course.  Following the caller's instructions.  My soul just left my body.  I just went numb to everything so that I could just survive.  I got the video up.  First of all, she's very pretty.  She's a little young thing.  And, uh, she's got short, like, black hair.  It's John Stossel. 
[02:07:30]  And, uh, she's, uh, she's trying to cover up her young body.  See, I'm trying to make it hot for the GM.  Yeah.  Her young, hot body.  Sex.  With a black apron.  Hmm.  Is that all they show, though?  That's the best they'll, uh, that's the furthest they'll go with this?  You can tell she's completely naked in this chair, and she's just trying to cover up with a black apron.  After more than two and a half hours of dehumanizing treatment, Nix, again on the instructions of the caller, forces Louise to perform **** on him. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, boy.  You were a prisoner.  I was.  Tap dance.  And a victim of sexual assault.  Yes.  She's right.  Almost three hours into Louise's ordeal, the caller tells Nix to hand the phone back to Summers, and incredibly...  Can she pause this for a second?  Bring it.  I'm watching on the 22...  Look at this right there.  The goddamn ABC has to have their stupid logo on it, and I can't see what's happening because the logo is covering the girl. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  By the way, now I'm looking at a part of the video where she's completely naked, but they're, you know, they're fuzzing it up, but she has her hands in the air because she's doing jumping jacks.  You can see her doing the jumping jacks in the video.  You know, you don't get to see any of the naughty parts, but you can use your imagination.  They're fuzzing that area out.  Now she's turned around so he can see her backside.  Ooh, look at that.  She is barely covered.  This has to be...  And he's sitting in a chair, you know, just taking it all in. 
[02:09:00]  This has to be somewhere, this whole video.  It's up on break.com, supposedly.  Somebody will get the whole video.  Yeah, we'll find out where...  The guy's sitting in the chair, and the big logo is in the way.  You bunch of douches.  Why is that logo in the way?  Oh, yeah, she's kind of cute.  She's cute, and now, what is this?  Oh, my God, they're actually showing the spanking!  Aw.  Except, you know, the area he's spanking is a big blur, but you see the rest of her body bent all the way over. 
[02:09:30]  Her head's touching the floor, and this guy's a creep!  Boy, is she stupid.  Yeah, she's a...  You are dumb.  And also, the fact that they have that 2020 In Touch food hoax.  They're so obsessed with their own goddamn branding, they are ruining the video.  That they're cutting out the most important part of the picture.  What's happening to the girl.  That's awful.  The guy's got some horrendous balding going on.  He's doing kind of a comb-over thing, and he's awkwardly spanking her. 
[02:10:00]  He's getting his arm way up in the air and going, boom, boom, straight down.  We need this video unedited.  Yeah, we need this on...  Where will that end up without the blurring?  Well, let's get Steve to link it to opianthony.com, first of all, because...  We've got her doing jumping jacks naked.  The video's amazing.  ...the phone back to Summers, and incredibly instructs her to bring in someone else.  This time, she ushers in Thomas Sims, a 58-year-old maintenance man who works at the restaurant. 
[02:10:30]  Maintenance man.  He gets on the phone with the caller.  But Sims refuses to comply with his demands.  Tom told me this man is asking for her to drop her apron so I can see her without that apron.  And I said, do what?  And it floored me.  Only then, Summers says, does she realize she's been had.  I couldn't believe it.  Could not believe it.  I have been had like no other person's been had.  Spanking.  Well, then why wouldn't the scumbag lawyer let her answer the question about when she walked in and the girl was naked? 
[02:11:00]  Why is she...  The lawyers should all just be shot.  Why is she over this man's knee getting spanked?  Because she's been bad.  There is no excuse for that whatsoever.  Yeah.  She was raised right.  What a dope this girl is.  I'm sorry.  She really is just stupid, but the video is terrific.  Like, obviously, you know, it's terrible that this girl is a victim of this and everything.  But Jesus, you got to draw the line somewhere where you go from being victim to complete idiot. 
[02:11:30]  I think by the naked jumping jacks, you got to be like, hey, wait a minute.  I think something's up here.  At least he's got some kind of an excuse.  You do the jumping jacks because we're afraid you're stashing stuff.  So if you do the jumping jacks, things are going to fall on the floor.  But get over my knee.  I'm going to spank your bare bottom.  For what?  Isolate that.  Yeah.  Not like I don't say it all the time. 
[02:12:00]  Unfortunately, we got to leave this part of the show.  Damn it.  But there's a quick clip that wraps some of this up.  Buddy Stump is a detective with a Mount Washington.  Buddy Stump.  He arrests Donna Summer's fiancee, Walter Nix, and he begins to try and find a caller.  I said, this has got to be somebody on a pay phone.  Maybe we're going to win Dixie, and they're getting their jollies off of watching all the action and the fleas roll in.  You think?  You think he's getting their jollies?  How are they watching the action?  Rumor has it he might have tapped into the security cameras. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, nice.  There's all sorts of stuff.  We'll find the video.  We'll have it linked to opianathlete.com.  It's really amazing because it's a little tiny little storage room in the back.  She's sitting there really just uncomfortable, naked.  I was thinking she was going to – I thought she was going to be like a mess or something.  Right.  But no, she's a cute girl.  Yeah, she's a cute girl.  Absolutely a cute girl.  She needs guidance.  You know, they show as much as they can because it's ABC News.  But you see her completely naked going over the guy's knee, and then that part of her body is blurred out. 
[02:13:00]  But you can see him still spanking the blurred out part.  Did we make it hot enough for you?  Some guy waiting for his Big Mac out front.  Guy spanking out with his own Big Mac.  Special sauce all over the place.  All right, well.  It sucks we had to rush through that last story because that's a good one, and the phones are going nuts. 
[02:13:30]  But we unfortunately have to leave right now.  Maybe we'll talk about that tomorrow a little more, okay?  Yeah.  But we will have the video linked up on opianthony.com very shortly so you can check it out yourself.  Hey, guys, thanks a lot.  We greatly appreciated, you know, you're listening to the show today.  If you liked what you heard today, why don't you tell a friend that's how the virus spreads.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day. 
[02:14:00]  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall, maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along. 
[02:14:30]  Golden funds is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and plummet as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Run!  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  No, it only began.  Yep.  It began right when we left the building.  That's right.  It's really cold.  Here's a lady. 
[02:15:00]  Here's a lady.  Oops.  Coldest walkover to date.  Yeah.  Fuck this shit.  The walkover's done.  It's going to warm up about 10 degrees.  I didn't see that.  Not today.  I mean, like, for the rest of the week, it's going to be a little warmer than today.  I didn't see that.  This is a brisk walk.  Yeah, you know.  Oh, it's awful.  We're going to start walking a little faster with the walkover unless something really good is happening.  Yeah.  It's going to be the XM jogover.  No reason to take our time when it's this cold.  It's going to be the XM driveover in a heated limo. 
[02:15:30]  Hoo-hoo.  All right.  Well, we're almost here.  Oh, well, I have to stop and look at the Taylor Hicks poster.  I saw that.  I love him.  We're trying to get him in to perform, are we?  After that interview we had with him, I don't see that happening.  Well, Roland wrote us, and I said, look, no more interviews with Taylor Hicks.  We want to have him perform.  So this is all we give the people today.  Oh, yeah.  That's it. 
[02:16:00]  They get shit on the walk.  Yeah, but we'll bring a bunch of them upstairs to check out the show.  Yeah.  We're going right in.  Thank you, guys.  Look at that.  Check the trailer guy.  Two out of three.  Thanks, everybody.  That was fun.  Two out of three are sick, so there's no reason to stay out there and get sick or catch our death.  All right.  We'll be upstairs.  Yes.  XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Enkle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe. 
[02:16:30]  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Cornwalls.  Three retards. 
[02:17:00]  We have the effect of town all PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  There we go. 
[02:17:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  Arizona.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll be right back. 
[02:18:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:18:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:19:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:19:30]  You don't even have time to button up because you've got to start the second half of the show.  You're all unbuckled. 
[02:20:00]  I want to be able to just relax and take a leak in between shows.  And I knew Ant was in there and you were in there.  Someone has to get in here.  You know, Ant usually starts the show.  It's rare that he actually takes a bathroom break.  And so I'm like, ah, I got to finish up.  So I just quickly thought I was done.  And I put it back in my pants and I'm soaked.  I peed my pants, I think.  I'm dribble.  Because I rushed in here because there's no time to do anything.  You got to eat your breakfast in eight minutes. 
[02:20:30]  Because the listeners get pissed off if they hear food in your mouth.  Yep.  So you try to do the right thing at times.  You know, sometimes you're like, fuck it.  I got to eat and screw everybody.  Would you like me to dry it?  No.  Get a hair dryer.  I got to apologize because I'm usually the guy that comes right in and gets that fucking music off right away.  Right.  Because I don't usually have to leak when I get here.  Right.  But I came in, I sat down, and Dan goes, tell me when you're ready. 
[02:21:00]  And I went, you know something?  I got to fucking piss.  And I'm not going to sit here uncomfortable for God knows how long until we do take a break.  Right.  So I went in to take a leak, and then no one was in here.  Right.  By the way, and now they're bitching because the rage music went on too long.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Is this the only intro music, or is it a test for the emergency broadcasting system?  It was because I had to take a leak.  I'm sick, you motherfucker.  Did you guys fall down the stairs? 
[02:21:30]  That's art from Boston.  I had to take a leak.  Look, we do drinking fluids.  Five to five and a half hours of radio a day.  And all we want is a break to eat.  And a break to take a leak.  That's all.  And a shit occasionally.  Well, that would be nice, yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.  Why not play Ecstasy of Gold in between shows?  That's not a bad idea.  Ecstasy of Brown.  Why can't we play the Ecstasy of Gold?  Shit joke.  That was funny.  I've been here, what, 30 seconds? 
[02:22:00]  We're all a good log joke answer.  Straightens everybody out.  Keeps you honest.  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you.  Atta boy.  All right, so what are we going to get into?  We're going to have some stories and some news.  News.  Pal talks up, Creighton.  I just chit-chat.  I just need a yogurt.  Do you have any of that granola laying around, Jimmy?  Whatever's around, you can have.  Granola.  I'm back to eating healthy.  No, I fucked around a little bit on the road.  A couple desserts.  Oh, that road will fuck you up.  It's hard, man, because you try to eat a certain food.  It's like, I'm in fucking two different restaurants in Florida. 
[02:22:30]  I'm like, do you guys have any fruit?  They're like, no, we don't have any fresh fruit for dessert.  I'm like, what the fuck?  My girlfriend has good abs, so she can order whatever she wants.  It's just a smoothie.  Oh, she doesn't have to work at it?  Nah, well, she does Pilates and shit.  It really bugs me.  So I'm fucking eating.  What did she get the other night?  It was like one of those, it was just ice cream with caramel and nougat.  Nougat.  It was lovely.  What is nougat?  And she's like, yeah, come on, we'll share it.  But she's 10 years younger than me.  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  So I'm fucking eating garbage and I'm just trying to eat better now.  It's really hard.  Having a chick, man, I'm so rarely in relationships that we eat out a lot.  You kind of do stuff you normally don't do.  And I'm eating decent, but it's like I was eating at the Comedy Cellar every night,  having two veggie burgers with no bread and two veggie skewers.  I'm eating better.  And now I'm fucking hanging out with her and she wants a dessert.  I'm eating a dessert.  I'm eating a pussy.  We're fucking.  She's sucking my dick.  I mean, you know.  You know how it is.  You shoot a load in the mouth. 
[02:23:30]  You fucking giggle at each other because you know what you just gave her.  You try on the road.  It is tough.  It's impossible.  Because room service ends at 11 o'clock, so they have a minibar,  so I'm shoving cashews into my fucking thin-lipped face.  Yep.  That's what they do.  How do you not?  I was Oreo cookie guy.  You're so sweet.  Horrible.  Oreo fucking cookies.  And they're banning trans fats.  I don't know if I'm for that again, so I'm kind of glad,  but it's like, can we fucking, as Americans,  just stop eating fucking McDonald's?  Wait, you're glad that they're banning trans fats?  I have no willpower, so in a way I'm glad. 
[02:24:00]  I don't get it.  Well, can they make the food without it?  Like, can they make it just as good without it?  Yeah.  And supposedly it tastes better, but...  So I don't know why they haven't done this before.  Maybe because the other oils are, I don't know, cost more?  Probably cheaper, yeah.  But I don't get...  Yeah.  But it's the whole government involvement thing.  I know.  I don't get...  Why are they that worried about our health?  Of course they're going to go,  well, health insurance costs going up and this, blah, blah, blah.  You know what they said?  They said that banning trans fats will save 100 New Yorkers a year. 
[02:24:30]  One hundred.  And that's why I can't find a decent apartment in Manhattan.  Do you know how many people die of anything else?  Yep.  And it's over 100 people?  Yeah, that just goes on and on and on.  Let's go with the obvious thing, though, okay?  Beer.  Yeah.  Booze.  You go out, you booze it up.  Why don't you go ban booze, you brave politician?  Yeah.  You...  Or it's only to save 100 fat New Yorkers, too. 
[02:25:00]  Because if they were going to die,  because they have no fucking ability to not eat trans fats,  then they're going to fucking die of something else.  And by the way, I believe you should be able to drink your face off.  Right.  But the point is, you know what?  They always go after the safe shit.  You know, I think...  And then they brag, like Ann said,  a hundred New Yorkers a year will not...  Well, their lives will be saved.  Jesus.  Yeah.  A hundred is nothing.  How many people are in this city?  Fucking...  It's got to be 10,000, 20,000.  Perhaps more than that, Anthony. 
[02:25:30]  But barely.  But barely more than that.  I really...  I wish someone asked Bloomberg that.  Why don't you just ban alcohol?  If you want to save lives...  Because nobody ever ate trans fats  and then fucking barreled into a limo  and beheaded a little girl.  He'd probably love to ban booze.  Of course.  I think the thing about the trans fats...  Here's the thing about the trans fats.  No one knows what the fuck they are  or what they're in.  They really don't...  Do you...  When you buy something,  do you know if there's trans fats in it?  You might.  Oops.  Kind of savvy about food and what's in it. 
[02:26:00]  But the average person...  I look at the labels, actually.  But what's on a label...  Let's look at a label of some food.  Does it say trans fats?  On some labels, I believe it does.  On some...  It says a percentage of how much or...  What about stuff you don't know?  You go into a deli.  You grab a sandwich and some fries.  So you're trying to...  Were the fries made in trans fats?  Like, I'm just saying,  it's one of those things that no one knows  what they're in or not.  Well, someone else is saying that...  What they're in or not.  They're not really...  They're not telling us what's in the trans fat.  Maybe they've had some studies  and they realize that this is causing waterheads 
[02:26:30]  or something.  Waterhead babies?  What?  No, it's pretty much just like  cardiopulmonary bullshit.  You know?  It clogs you up.  It goops you up.  All right.  So get that info out there  and then you as a human being  walking this fine earth of ours,  you can decide if you want trans fats or not.  But that's what I'm saying.  Sometimes you can't.  You just go into a place  and you get something  and you don't know  if it's been cooked in trans fats  at a restaurant  or something like that.  I don't know.  Oh, you get some...  Vegetables.  Let's say you get some vegetables.  A little stir fry.  Are they using trans fats in there 
[02:27:00]  as they're stir frying it?  You know?  It's kind of...  They're vague with it.  I don't know.  Believe me.  I'm not for any laws.  I love anarchy.  I'd love to just be out with guns  shooting people,  grabbing their goods.  If I get knocked off,  hey, what the fuck?  Someone was better than me.  It was part of the game.  I love anarchy.  The whole thing is this.  I mean, I'm against government intrusion too.  I fucking hate them.  But we do elect them  to do a certain amount of things for us.  And every time they make a decision,  it doesn't mean that they're big brothering us.  There are times when they make... 
[02:27:30]  Man.  Yeah.  I mean, there are times  they make a health decision  that makes sense.  I like the seatbelt law.  I like the seatbelt law.  I like the motorcycle helmet law.  Yeah, me too.  Things like that.  Because in a way,  even though I've decided  to use seatbelts,  this protects me  because if some idiot  runs into me  and I'm fine  and he's launched  through the fucking windshield  because he decided  he's not going to fucking  wear a seatbelt,  I'm fucked.  Yeah.  You know?  My fucking...  I'm getting sued  by his family 
[02:28:00]  because this idiot  didn't wear a seatbelt.  And the government  has nothing to gain  by passing that law.  There's no devious reasons.  Extra tickets, man.  Yeah, that's what they say.  And they are using it  to make more money,  believe me.  Of course.  They'll use it.  But I think the nature,  the initial intent  of the whole thing was  and it has saved lives.  And it makes sense  and it works  and you know what?  I wear the seatbelt  because I don't want to  fucking go through the windshield  and I don't want to get a ticket.  Hey, we got a man speech  on the line here.  Marcelo from San Diego.  The more people 
[02:28:30]  that stay alive, man,  the more taxes come in, man.  Yeah, that's what it is.  They see long-term implications, man.  Man.  Same reason they keep people  doped on antidepressants  so they can keep working.  It's a conspiracy, man.  I love conspiracy, guys.  By the way,  Marcelo from San Diego  was using the sarcasm  because he wrote sarcasm  in a little parenthesis.  So I just added the man for him.  Yeah.  Fights the man. 
[02:29:00]  Man.  That's a good idea.  John from Chicago.  Or a good comment.  John from Chicago, line eight.  Hey there, Gianni.  How you doing?  Hey, sweeties.  How you doing?  Good, good.  Hey, so I want to know  these savage deli owners  and these fucking Koreans,  are they going to...  I mean, they're using cat  in their product.  You know what I mean?  Like, how are they going to know  what has trans fat  and what doesn't?  Yeah, how are they going to enforce  this whole trans fat law  when, you know,  you can do it with stuff  that comes in a bag  or something 
[02:29:30]  or it's got a label on it,  but what are you going to  inspect every restaurant  and make sure  they don't have any trans fats  on premises?  How often are you going to,  you know,  inspect these places?  It just seems like  a lot of work  is going into this.  A lot of money.  And people are like...  Good luck.  Dan from Queensbury,  trans fats are horrible for you.  The only reason restaurants  use them  is they keep longer.  Basically, the government  is making restaurants  cook safely  rather than save a few pennies. 
[02:30:00]  Okay, good.  This is a good thing.  Not a big brother thing.  Good.  I agree.  That is a good thing, then.  It's fine.  All right, whatever.  Yeah, we need the FDA  to a certain degree.  I mean, these fucking scumbag...  You can't trust...  I mean, we don't trust the government,  but you can't trust the companies  to do right by you either.  Are you going to trust McDonald's  or any other place  or a drug company  to fucking...  to take a product  that makes them a lot of money  off the shelf  because it's bad for you?  No.  You know what, though?  It's going to hit Joe Consumer  in the pocketbook.  Well, you know what?  You have to...  You have to pull somebody's purse strings  if you want things changed. 
[02:30:30]  And you're right.  You hit somebody  in the pocketbook.  Pocketbook.  They'll be out  at the next election.  Andrew in Jersey,  what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I was just curious.  Can I come upstairs  to watch your show?  Oh, you did the walkover  with us today?  Yeah.  You sure can,  John Q. Citizen.  Andrew.  Come on up, Andrew.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right, Andykins.  All right, we got an update  on the Baby Bird  and Pat from Menachie.  You want to get into this?  Yeah, a little closure.  Do we have closure?  Yeah, we'll do closure. 
[02:31:00]  Have you guys listened  to the pop songs or what?  What?  You get into a good pop song  every once in a while?  Pop songs?  I love a pop song.  We got the list  of the top ten  most annoying pop songs  of 2006.  Annoying are usually  the most catchy.  There's a couple on here  I actually enjoyed.  Actually enjoyed.  Which ones?  I don't have that list.  I'm not going to say yet.  I don't think I have  that list either.  I grabbed the  surprise list.  Yeah.  Sometimes there's  surprise lists.  Does somebody have,  does Bill have the list? 
[02:31:30]  Someone knows.  I play game show hosts  and you guys guess  at what's coming next.  I love guessing games.  I do too.  I like when we play  guess what number one is.  Alright, well,  baby bird incident.  Yes, the baby bird video  which we're finally  not promoting as much,  you know,  but we had to  kind of ride that  bit for a while.  But I guess it's up  to 1.2 million views  on break.com alone.  Someone told me  it's on uselessjunk.com  on their front page.  It's just everywhere.  I haven't seen it.  It's kind of buried  on Google. 
[02:32:00]  I was hoping to see  it make its way  up the charts  on google.com  but to no avail.  But it's okay.  Millions of people  have seen this video.  It was part of the  eggnog drinking contest.  You guys know that by now.  Pat from Minaki  won the contest,  set a new record  and then Joe Rogan  came up with this idea  and then then  nicknamed it  the baby bird  and now it caused  so much controversy  that Pat from Minaki  was kicked out  of the IFOCE  which is a competitive  eating organization  that Pat was proud 
[02:32:30]  to be a part of.  They do the  Nathan's Hot Dog  Eating Contest  every 4th of July  in Coney Island  and all that.  And if you've been  listening to the show  the last couple days  we've been discussing this.  We got,  what's his name,  George Shea?  George Shea on the phone  yesterday.  He is in charge  of the IFOCE.  I don't know  his exact title  and he banned Pat  but he was going to  consider reinstating him.  After the outpouring  of support  that Pat got. 
[02:33:00]  Support from like  people,  not the floor  of his trailer.  Right.  Tends to fall  through every so often.  Certainly not God either.  So we got two pages  in front of us.  Not that father  of his either.  We got two pages  in front of us.  Or his pancreas.  Or that girl he loves.  Pat gets no support  where it counts.  Poor Pat.  Not even in his arches.  So we got the two pages  in front of us  and it's titled  Baby Bird Incident Panel. 
[02:33:30]  Analysis and Recommendations  Issued December 6th, 2006.  Wow.  Do you have a copy of this, Ed?  Oh, who wouldn't?  Okay, good.  Who wants to start this?  Baby Bird Incident Panel, yeah.  Incident Panel.  The Baby Bird Incident Panel,  a group of professional  competitive eaters,  was convened  by the International Federation  of Competitive Eating  to address the so-called  Baby Bird Video  and participation  of Patrick Philbin  in this video.  The BBIP,  Baby Bird Incident Panel, 
[02:34:00]  for those of you  who don't know  what the BBIP is,  has been mandated  to analyze the actions  of Mr. Philbin  and determine  if they contradict  the IFOCE Code of Conduct.  Further,  the BBIP  has been instructed  to consider  mitigating factors  including Mr. Philbin's  history as a lawyer  member of the IFOCE  and its extensive  fan following  and manner in which  he was expelled  from the IFOCE.  The BBIP 
[02:34:30]  will weigh these factors  to determine  if the IFOCE  acted precipitously  in its expulsion  of Mr. Philbin,  failing to fully examine  the situation  and consider  alternative remedies.  Finally,  the BBIP  will propose  recommendations  to help guide  the IFOCE  in its efforts  to achieve justice.  These abbreviations  are bugging me,  so how about this?  Finally,  the BBIP  will help guide  the IFOC.  the BBIP  IFOC.  IFOC.  All right, 
[02:35:00]  the BBIP  and the IFOC.  The BBIP  and the IFOC.  Moving on,  the Baby Bird Video.  The Baby Bird Video  focuses on Pat Philbin  who has consumed  an estimated  75 glasses  of eggnog  and aspiring  Opie and Anthony  intern  in a test  of loyalty  and commitment  to the show  lies prostrate  and open mouth  under Mr. Philbin  as Mr. Philbin  evacuates  the contents  of his stomach,  predominantly eggnog  based on a casual  visual inspection,  onto the intern.  This is written  like a legal document.  And now here is 
[02:35:30]  what I guess  is the IFOCE,  the IFOC.  I Code of Conduct.  I love that.  I talk to you.  The IFOC Code of Conduct  covers a variety  of issues  relating to  the public behavior  of eaters.  The Code of Conduct  touches on  one issue in particular  that is relevant  to the Baby Bird Video  in which it states  the eater shall not act  in a way that  purposefully  diverges  from common decency,  offending public morals 
[02:36:00]  and debasing  either the eater  or the sport  of competitive eating.  The Code of Conduct  allows for disciplinary action  if eaters fail  to follow  these guidelines.  Code of Conduct  is COC.  So it should just be  cock.  Cock.  The IFOC cock.  The IFOC-y cock.  The IFOC-y cock  has stated.  Jimmy, why don't you  do the next  IFOC-y expulsion  of...  The IFOC-y  after viewing  the Baby Bird Video  took immediate action  by expelling  Mr. Philbin  from his membership 
[02:36:30]  and delisting him  from its international  rankings.  Mr. Philbin  was notified  of this action  via email.  The IFOC-y  justified  the expulsion  by citing  a breach  of the cock.  Of course.  Code of Conduct.  Of course.  but will be now  known as cock.  Public response.  The IFOC-y  received hundreds  of emails  most citing  the qualities  of Mr. Philbin  and asking  for immediate  reinstatement. 
[02:37:00]  Other directing  IFOC-y officials  to perform  a sexual act...  That's really funny.  Others directing  IFOC-y officials  to perform  a sexual act  commonly acknowledged  as taboo  among all cultures  that proscribe  incestuous contact  between a mother  and a son.  These emails  also asked  for Mr. Philbin's  immediate reinstatement.  Fans noted  that they were not  offended by the video  or the actions  in it  and that Mr. Philbin 
[02:37:30]  should not be  penalized for actions  away from the  competitive eating table.  I like the description  of go fuck  your mother.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  B-bip analysis.  After lengthy review,  the B-bip concurs  that the actions  of Mr. Philbin  can be viewed  as a blatant affront  to the cock  and to the gentlemanly  spirit of the sport  of competitive eating.  However,  it is also clear  that the IFOC-y decision  was made too quickly  and did not include  a full review. 
[02:38:00]  Let's go to the  B-bip recommendations.  The B-bip feels  that while the actions  of the baby bird video  are likely to offend  the vast majority  of Americans,  the IFOC-y acted  with undue haste  in its expulsion  of Mr. Philbin  failing to conduct  an administrative review  of the incident  and failing to provide  Mr. Philbin  with an opportunity  to present a defense  of his actions.  What's more,  the B-bip believes  that the IFOC-y  had other courses  of action  express its distaste  for the video 
[02:38:30]  without expelling  Mr. Philbin.  The B-bip recommends  that the IFOC-y  reinstate Mr. Philbin  after delivering  to him  a strongly worded  censure  condemning  his actions.  So what this means  is Pat is back in.  He will be censured.  Hi guys.  Hi guys.  I'm back in tomorrow.  I'm back in the IFOC-y.  IFOC-y you.  Of course.  Well, where is Pat?  They almost IFOC-y'd me. 
[02:39:00]  This is a big day  for Pat.  Where is he?  Hopefully he's crawling  through broken glass  behind Tanya  and she's spitting on him.  Alright, we'll get Pat  on the phone.  Step aside.  We'll do the, uh...  I have to piss.  You do?  Do ya?  Do ya?  I have to piss.  Alright, we'll do the, uh,  top ten most annoying  pop songs of 2006.  Please.  I'm scared.  Oh, fuck.  Sting is still singing  with his lute as well.  I see here.  Can't wait till they...  Enough about the lute. 
[02:39:30]  Someone should just put  that lute right in Sim...  Ugh, fuck me.  Oh, boy.  I have...  Right in Sim...  Yeah.  Now we all know  that Opie and Anthony  Wow Stickers  are your tickets  to seeing some  beautiful bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that  Wow Stickers  have many other uses?  I use Wow Stickers  around the house  to keep raccoons  away from my garbage.  Come here, little fella.  Oh, God!  Oh, God, he's biting my balls.  Jesus Christ, my balls.  Ouch, ouch, my balls. 
[02:40:00]  My balls are being bit  by a raccoon here, people.  Dude, raccoon  eating my balls here.  Raccoon on balls.  Anybody?  Do you see the raccoon  dangling from my crotch?  Get your official  Opie and Anthony  Wow Stickers  at opiananthony.com.  Derek, there's, uh,  something hanging off  your balls, man.  Hey, the listeners  keep us honest. 
[02:40:30]  They really do.  Art from Boston,  he's a faithful listener  of the show.  He writes, uh,  that new O&A promo  about Wow Stickers  and raccoons  hanging off someone's  balls has about  as much excitement  excitement as energy  and energy  as, uh,  uh,  as Steve  trying to act  and he spelled out  Steve.  Can we hear that again?  They don't like 
[02:41:00]  the Wow Promo.  No?  It's old.  Oh, it's old?  Yeah.  All right,  why don't we play that?  Yeah.  Now, we all know  that Opie and Anthony  Wow Stickers  are your tickets  to seeing  some beautiful bosoms.  Oh, yeah.  Did you know  that Wow Stickers  have many other uses?  I use Wow Stickers  around the house  to keep raccoons  away from my garbage.  Come here,  little fella.  Oh, God!  Oh, God,  it's biting my balls.  Jesus Christ,  my balls.  Ouch, ouch,  my balls.  My balls are being  bit by a raccoon 
[02:41:30]  here, people.  Dude,  raccoon eating  my balls here.  Raccoon on balls.  Anybody,  do you see  the raccoon  dangling from my crotch?  It's Opium Anthony!  Get your official  Opium Anthony  Wow Stickers  at opiumanthony.com.  Derek,  there's something  hanging off your balls,  man.  I like it.  It's all right.  Yeah.  It doesn't describe  what Wow is,  and that's the problem  I have,  because we still have  a lot of people out there  that have no idea  what Wow is.  That was a Wow promo?  Yeah.  Are you shitting me?  Well,  it's about Wow Stickers,  but why would you 
[02:42:00]  get the Wow Stickers?  I was completely  fixated on the balls.  This person got  the Wow Stickers  for something that  has nothing to do  with Whip'em Out Wednesdays.  I get the premise  of the promo,  but you then have to  explain what they're  really used for.  That promo is abominable.  All right.  The acting in this bed.  By the way,  everything is bad about us.  How funny was it  to have Craig  saying really dirty shit  over there, man?  What if a kid heard?  Oh, yeah.  And everyone wants to know  what was some of the stuff  he was saying.  Oh, God,  we can't even repeat it. 
[02:42:30]  No,  it's a horrible,  sexually explicit  and racist.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah.  I think you could  figure it out.  Yeah.  All right,  let's go to Nick  in Pennsylvania.  Nick,  Yo,  what's up,  guys?  Hey, Nick.  Yo.  Hey,  what was the bit  that got that  general manager so hard?  The Uncle Paul bit?  Oh, no,  we said it the other day.  We said it when we  brought it up.  It was a lesbian story.  The reason that he  had a rock-hard  heart on.  A raging heart on. 
[02:43:00]  A rock-hard  heart on  or a raging heart on  was, you know,  it was justified,  but you just don't  tell your friends  how hard your cock  is getting.  Yeah,  don't tell it to people.  It's fucked up.  All right.  All right,  buddy.  Thank you,  sir.  You guys want to  look at the top  ten most annoying  pop songs of 2006?  I bet they're  fun songs.  I know.

Some other.  It's  Goodbye,  my lover.  Goodbye,  my friend.  His other  hit.  Who is he?  He's just  atrocious.  That's what

Fucking  ass.  I can't even  watch that movie  anymore.  I was like,  I was lost.  That was on.  He's lost in  like a two foot  by two foot  square of bushes.  He's awful.  He's spinning in  circles.  It's a garden 
[02:47:00]  that's fucking  that's kept in  by string around it.  Where are you  going,  stupid?  Same fucking  intro as the  last song.  All right.  We know this song.

[02:48:00]  I've had enough  of her,  too.  I don't know  this at all.  Someone's saying  that James Blunt  won Grammy  for best song  of the year.  Is that his name?  Is that him?  James Blunt?  James Blunt.  I thought it was  Michael Plague.  I know,  that was James Blunt.  James Blunt.  All right.  Let me be so.  Your music stinks,  James.  Ring the alarm.  Okay,  number eight.  If I was him,  I'd want my name  to be James  beat around the bush  so people could hint  at how much I sucked.

Dude, you can  ride on him  all you want.  He's got one  of the hottest  chicks around,  bro. 
[02:50:00]  Dude, I'm not  saying he's ugly.  I'm not saying  he's fucking  a whingy douche.  Of course he's got  a hot chick.  They love that  nonsense.  Yo, beautiful.  He probably met  her on a train  like he said.  Too bad it wasn't  a train in Japan.  She would have  had fucking  30 little yellow  dicks rubbed  all over her.  Yo, beautiful.  I love when  Jimmy gets annoyed.  It's just he's  a fucking woman.  I love when  you get annoyed  at something as 
[02:50:30]  simple as a  James Blood.  It's like who  cares stuff,  but it just  hits you in a  deep place in  your soul.  It really just  makes me ill.  Catch some water,  please, from  somebody.  Hey, there's two  things.  I'm from Boston.  This song stole  the intro sirens  from War Pigs  by Ozzy.  The what?  The real thing,  Bo Bice with  the sirens coming  in.  A little observation.  And then David  from Jersey  taking music  advice from  Jimmy Norton.  If one day he  got out of the  70s, maybe  James Blunt  is good to  chill to. 
[02:51:00]  It does not  always have to  be Ozzy.  I'm not saying  it always has to  be Ozzy.  Do you and your  pal chill to him  on the sofa  downstairs when  you're jerking  each other off?  Your fucking  pants around  your fucking  thighs in case  your wives  walk down?  You have to  pull them up  real quick?  What is this?  Mark in Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's  going on?  Hey.  If you listen  to the beginning  of that James  Blunt song, it  sounds like the  Walking Away music  from The Incredible  Hulk totally  ripped it off.  I'm sure it did.  Sounded nothing  like it, by the  way. 
[02:51:30]  I only listened  to it.  All right, thank  you, sir.  Listen to the  words I did.  Man.  Yeah, I'll be  out here.  Am I?  By the way, someone  needs attention, Dave  from Atlantic City.  Opie, you just  said the GM had  a raging rock  hard hot one.  Ha ha ha, you  fucking faggot.  What?  Now what, Dave?  Yeah.  Now what?  Now what?  You wrote it 50  times, I read it.  Now what?  Now what happens?  Um, I can't wait  to see what number  is supposed to  happen now, Dave.  The next one is.  All right, yeah, 
[02:52:00]  we're moving on  with the most  annoying pop songs  of 2006.  Here's number  seven.  I've never heard this  in my life.  What the fuck?  It's elevator music.  Oh, now it rocks. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, now I would  pick this up in a  second.  This is Ne-Yo.  N-E-Y-O.  When you're mad.  I don't think I  heard this this year.  It's horrible.  It's really fucking  Casio he used for  this.  Don't you have to  know or hear songs  before they become  annoying?  I know that  irritating voice. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, please.  Yeah, disrespect.  I never got into  R&B.  I just can't enjoy it.  My girlfriend likes  it.  I want to like it,  but I can't.  She loves it.  Not a big fan.  It's terrible.  All right, let's  get rid of that one.  Who gives a shit?  Steve.  Hey, by the way,  someone is pointing  out, Jimmy, you do  like pop songs because  you have Jenny from  the block.  Yeah, I'm going to  say I don't like  pop songs.  No, because I was  trying to think of a  pop song you actually  like.  Yeah, safety dance,  which is what I  would ask Jenny from.  See, these are the  ones you're not  supposed to like  because they're  annoying.  You know what I 
[02:53:30]  mean?  There are songs that  hit that you kind  of like.  Sure, popular songs  are called pop  because they're  popular.  What?  Very good.  Well, it's okay.  All right, this next  one is on the list  as well.  Number six, top ten  most annoying pop  songs of two.  I can talk over  intros.  I did it for a  living for a long  time.  Jesus, bro.  And panicky, Bill.  Top ten most  annoying pop songs  of 2006.  Fergie, London  Bridge.  The only station  that really fags it  up. 
[02:54:00]  Fergie.  I kind of like this  video.  I don't like  Fergie.  I liked how she  was moving in this  video, so.  Fergie's attractive.  Fergie.  Wait.  Yeah.  Wait for the  talk.  I liked  You're not digging the Fergie? 
[02:54:30]  You know what bridge should come down?  The one in San Francisco that fucking pancaked her in the quake. 
[02:55:00]  It should fall right on her cut lips.  Why the anger?  She's just trying to make a living.  My London, London bridge wants to come down?  What the fuck does that mean?  She's doing an old kid fairy tale-y thing.  What does that mean?  London bridge is falling down?  I don't know.  I think she's giving head.  No.  Is that what you got out of that?  She's not.  Or someone's pants are coming down.  I don't know.  I got a raging heart on.  My London, London bridge wants to come down? 
[02:55:30]  Do the listeners appreciate that as much as we do?  I just don't know.  It was so creepy.  Hey, there was something here I wanted to go to.  Oh, the Neo song.  Yes.  The Neo, N-E-Y-O, that song, When You're Mad, is about angry sex.  Oh, is it?  It didn't sound like it.  No, it didn't.  It was so nice.  It sounded like a bucket of shit.  Stupid, whiny, fucking BLS music.  Crap.  Good, I need you.  You're beautiful. 
[02:56:00]  I saw you on a train.  Being robbed with a screwdriver by four Negroes.  You're beautiful.  Well, he really doesn't like that.  I want to fucking cave his head in with a mic stand.  So why is...  Someone's saying we're playing the censored versions of the...  I don't know.  We don't know.  Who cares?  How do we know?  What, do they censor anything good out of them?  Let's go to Not Elo.  Yes, Not Elo.  Good morning, boys.  I just want to remind everyone that the most annoying pop songs can be found on XM20 or at eatabullet.com. 
[02:56:30]  Thank you.  All right.  We're getting an overhaul, Eat a Bullets, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to see Steve's guys working on it.  Yes.  Oh, one of Steve's guys.  Yeah, I've been busy.  Yeah, I love Fergie, by the way.  She was a meth head for a while.  Right.  Was she?  I don't know if she's still doing that.  Nice.  Hey, Chris, thanks for the idea from Boston.  All right.  Number 5, Top 10 Most Annoying Pop Songs of 2006.  Five.  I think I actually like this song.  Uh-oh.  I think I've heard this on Ethel a few times while working out. 
[02:57:00]  Let's hear.  There's a couple songs about this band I really like.  I'm just going to set it up here.  It sounds very 80-ish.  All right.  They kind of update the 80s sound a little bit.  Everything comes back.  This is Blue October in Hate Me.  I think this is the one I like by this band.  Or maybe not.  Does it kick in?  Better.  It's a pop song.  All right.  Blue October.  Hate Me.  You're beautiful.  Oh, no.  This is kind of the slower one.  I like to fucking knock his teeth out with the heel of a boot. 
[02:57:30]  But with holding it with my hand, not with my foot on it.  I have to block out thoughts of you so I don't lose my head.  They're crawling like a cockroach.  I don't like this at all.  Actually, I don't like this.  Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone.  Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home.  There's a burning in my pride.  That's all right. 
[02:58:00]  I'm bored with it already.  I'm bored with it, all right?  I'm bored with it.  We just got to play it to the hook.  It's coming.  The hook that drags them off stage.  Yes.  A lot of people wishing Fergie overdosed so we didn't have to hear London, London.  Oh, of course.  Who doesn't know this song?  It's all right.  It's the only one I like so far.  Look, we try to be honest on the show.  This isn't the one I'm thinking of because Taffy Begg writes, 
[02:58:30]  Oh, but it figures you'd like this.  It goes well with the Javalog.  That song isn't bad.  I have heard that.  It's not bad.  Yeah, that song's not bad.  I don't turn off the radio when that's on, but there's another one that I really liked.  Into the Ocean.  Wait, they also have Into the Ocean, the other.  Yeah, let's, this might be the one I like.  I'm just a normal boy that sank when I fell over.  Simon and Garfunkel.  You don't get it, huh?  This is Into the Ocean by Bluokover.  Without a life, thus I'd be stuck again.  Wish I was much more masculine.  It's not bad. 
[02:59:00]  J.S.K. Jr.  Now floating up and down.  I've been colliding into sound like whales beneath me, diving down.  I'm sinking to the bottom of my everything.  I'm not singing it either.  I like this.  Who is this guy?  It's true October.  Scott Peterson.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Goodbye, Burden, my old friend.  Sounds kind of like the other song.  Another song. 
[02:59:30]  Sounds a little bit like the Thompson Twins from back in the day.  Kind of has that 80s sound.  It's not bad.  It's all right.  I like Blue October.  I'm going to change my opinion.  This is so hard.  Shout, shout, let it all out.  It's, uh, whatever.  You know what the good thing about this show is?  I'm getting bands mixed up, by the way.  This show is, it's beautiful.  Goodbye, my lover.  Goodbye, my lover.  Goodbye, my lover. 
[03:00:00]  Ah!  Start pouring the Bikini Tini.  Yeah, I know.  Listening to that fucking depressing nonsense  as you look at a fucking carcass in a suit or dress.  I'm getting bands mixed up.  There's a song that goes on the dance floor,  and his voice is kind of, like, very different.  Do you know what song I love?  It's a pop song.  It's the theme from the British version of The Office.  Oh.  Glad, wait, handbags and glad rags,  or whatever the fuck it's called.  Anyone know what it is?  I know. 
[03:00:30]  You know what I mean?  No, though.  Yeah, we'll play it.  Hey, can I just...  I don't know it, Jimmy.  It's a good tune.  Can I share what just happened?  What?  I'm reaching for straws, obviously,  and I'm thinking of this band that does a song,  and somewhere in the lyrics it goes,  on the dance floor,  and his voice is kind of deep,  like that guy from Typo Negative, sort of.  Crest Pest Dummies.  Typo Negative, sort of, that guy's voice.  So I look at Bill, like, for help,  and he just goes...  Oh, he's gone.  Just shaking his head really fast.  He's in a tizzy.  Like, I don't know, I don't know.  Don't worry, Bill.  I didn't give you enough info for you to figure it out. 
[03:01:00]  Miss Travis is over there helping him.  Huh?  Travis.  Oh, by the way, Blue October...  God, Blue October, Delbert Grady from Virginia.  Hey, Peter Gabriel...  Delbert Grady.  I know.  Peter Gabriel called.  He wants his voice back.  Okay.  Yeah, there's some Peter Gabriel in there as well.  What are you saying?  Beard down to his toes?  Jesus.  What do we got, Travis?  Yes, Miss?  I think you're either thinking of Arctic Monkeys,  I bet she looks good on the dance floor,  or I bet you look good on the dance floor,  or she wants revenge.  Yeah, Arctic Monkeys is a cool band. 
[03:01:30]  Into the Arctic Monkeys, Jimmy?  No.  I'm not.  Want to be turned on to something?  I'd rather not be.  I'll listen to him.  I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to music.  Yeah, Joe, let's play a little bit of that real fast.  Arctic Monkeys.  He just gave me the one-moment sign.  Yeah.  I've heard some poppy songs that got trapped in my fucking head.  They would just stay there.  You can't get them out.  Can't remember their names or who did them or anything, but... 
[03:02:00]  Hey, yes, Arctic Monkeys,  I bet that you look good on the dance floor.  Man, this guy, King Taco.  He knows everything.  Oh, the one on the dance floor song is by She Wants Revenge.  Oh, it's She Wants Revenge is the name of the band, right?  Yeah, it's a band.  Okay, and then...  I didn't know that, actually, the name of the band, then.  And then he writes,  The Glad Rags and Handbags song is a theme to the British version of The Office.  That's what I said.  Yeah.  It's been redone by a few people, 
[03:02:30]  but the version that The Office plays at the beginning  and the end is fucking great.  Glad Bags and Handbags?  I don't know why I can't remember the name of the song.  I have it on my iPod, of course.  She Wants Revenge is the name of the band,  and the song is called Out of Control.  And the guy's name is...  Big George Wembley is the guy from...  I can't figure out any of these songs, can we? 
[03:03:00]  Is this She Wants Revenge?  Yeah.  Stop making the eyes at me.  I'm starting to make the eyes at you.  What it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to.  When your shoulders are frozen,  oh, but you're an explosion. 
[03:03:30]  Your name isn't real, but I don't care for sounding lights.  And I fuse my results in a bang, but the bang go.  I bet that you look good on the dance floor.  I don't know if you're looking for romance,  or I don't know what you're looking for.  I know that song.  You like it?  It's not bad.  This is good.  I'm going to dance into an intro pop like a robot from 1984.  Well, from 1984.  Good drummer.  Joking or...?  No. 
[03:04:00]  I can't tell drumming usually.  I usually can't either, so when it stands out, I know it's good.  I wish you'd stop ignoring me because he's sending me to despair.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  If I sound, yeah, you're calling me.  And I don't think it's very fair that your shoulders are frozen.  Oh, but you're an explosion.  Your name is a real name.  I don't care if I sign the lights and the fuse might result in my mind.  I know.  I bet that you look good on the dance floor.  I don't know what you're looking for.  I don't know what you're looking for. 
[03:04:30]  Where is it from?  New York?  New York, good on the dance floor.  That's cool, but I'll try to figure out the song I'm thinking of.  It's just, I don't know.  Man, damn, I can't think of it now.  All right.  Top 10 most annoying pop songs of 2006.  Here's number, are you ready for number four there, Bill?  You got to go back to another page on the thing?  Oh, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  He's ready.  Here's number four.  Uh-oh.  Bad Boy South.  Oh, Bill.  Block Entertainment.  You knew it had to start somewhere. 
[03:05:00]  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  Young Jock.  He resides in college park, right?  He's on TV.  But for right now, what we got to do for y'all, what we going to do?  We got to get y'all in here.  Hey.  Damn to hear today.  That's the million courts and light jock.  Where'd you stay?  Tell the college ball.  Where'd he chop call?  Young Jock.  It's going down.  It stinks. 
[03:05:30]  Enough of this goddamn crap.  Let's get it.  Where's Jimmy?  Because he's going to have a comment about this.  He had to take a leak.  Jimmy.  Is he leaking?  I don't know.  He'll be back.  Here he comes.  Were you finding a song?  No.  Well, yeah.  Bill asked me the name.  I gave him the name.  I think his guy's name is Big George Wembley.  But I had a question.  Yeah, because now I want to hear it.  Big in the pants?  Oh, I don't know.  I never saw his cock and balls.  I like being turned on to different music, man.  It's very...  The British...  The office is so fucking quick, the way it starts.  It's like a fucking 25 or 30 second intro to the show. 
[03:06:00]  And then the end of the play.  It's just great.  I like the Friends song.  What was that one?  All right, hold on.  Opie, you're right.  The song is She Wants Revenge.  Out of Control.  Travis just played the wrong song.  Well, that one was good, whatever he played.  You look good on the dance floor.  Who sings that?  Arctic Monkeys?  Yeah, okay.  Not Paul McCartney. 
[03:06:30]  Opie, you're right.  The song is She Wants Revenge.  Out of Control.  Is the name of the band, maybe?  Out of Control?  Now you got it?  Yeah, that's...  This is very 80s.  80s.  I could either be killed for liking this,  or people go, yeah, that's all right.  What are you going to tell?  Listen, his voice is just different. 
[03:07:00]  This is so 80s.  You would swear if you didn't know that this came out in the 80s.  Talking, running up to her side.  Snaps her fingers to keep the time.  Just wait for the hug.  On the back of the room, I saw her there.  I said she wants to be alone, and I shouldn't have.  But then she noticed me glanced at her.  I had no choice but to dance with her. 
[03:07:30]  The lights that move sideways and up and down.  The beat takes you over and spins you round.  Our hearts steady beating.  The sweat turns to gold.  We're slaves to the DJ and out of control.  Oh, you get the idea.  I'll watch your face move.  All right.  That was my OCD taking over. 
[03:08:00]  I needed to know the answer before he could move on.  That's fine.  Keith in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Morning, bubble boys.  My little potato sack of...  Howdy, howdy.  Hey, I got the explanation on the London Bridge.  And by the way, thanks for the Depeche Mode  I got a Robert Hazzard flashback.  Yeah, that was a little Depeche Mode.  The music was definitely Depeche Mode.  Elevator of life from Robert Hazzard.  But anyway, the London Bridge would be a chick  giving a blowjob and getting banged from behind.  Do you get it?  No.  Both guys standing, chick bent over. 
[03:08:30]  There are the towers, and she is the bridge.  Hey, look at that.  My London Bridge is going down?  Did she say they're coming down?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  Going?  Oh, those English.  That's what a London Bridge is.  Okay, that makes sense.  I stand corrected.  That's what a commonality is the definition.  But she's making the London Bridge with two other guys.  I like that.  But doesn't it say, uh, take the key and lock her up?  Yes.  You have to lock up the fair lady.  Punching out, boy.  Thank you.  All right.  My fair lady. 
[03:09:00]  All right, now we got the explanation.  Let's go to Ronnie in North Carolina.  Ronnie.  I'd like to call something out on Anthony there.  The James Blunt song when it first came back out, and I think it was January this year.  Anthony, you loved it.  You couldn't get it out of your head.  Didn't say I loved it, sir.  I said I saw him on SNL, do it live, and I found I couldn't turn it off.  There was something about his voice that was very unique, and that's what I said. 
[03:09:30]  I didn't say I loved it.  I said I loved you, Ronnie.  Okay, well, okay.  Do you love me?  No.  All right.  Shut up.  Okay, this is what I, uh.  Shut up, stupid.  Okay, if you did, you'd back it up.  You'd play it back.  You'd hear it.  You couldn't get the song out of your head.  You did.  You couldn't.  Yeah, it was one of those songs that gets catchy.  All right.  I have other songs that can't get out of my head either.  Right.  Now I got someone's voice from North Carolina I can't get out of my head.  All right, he's gone.  Called Ronnie.  He's gone.  Shut him up.  Look, he's gone, man.  Oh, thanks for Christ.  It's really interesting when you talk music.  You get people going, yeah, yeah, I like that song too. 
[03:10:00]  And then people calling you faggots.  And it's just like.  They get all, uh.  That's what music is all about.  It's a hodgepodge.  What I like, not necessarily you like.  Right.  It's all subjective.  And vice-versa.  Relax.  And vice-versa.  What you're going to get is a bevy of opinion.  Right.  A cavalcade.  A smorgasbord.  Yes, the word.  Well, with me, I spent so many years on the radio playing the typical music, the typical  rock music that, you know, for me to find new music, it has to be a lot different than 
[03:10:30]  what I heard for so many years on the radio.  Yeah.  So I have a really tough time, you know, finding stuff I actually like these days.  You know?  Does that make sense?  Yes.  I hear you.  Sort of.  Sure.  Hey, top ten most annoying pop songs of 2006.  We're number, we're up to number three.  Evanescence, Call Me When You're Sober.  Don't cry to me if you love me.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Fiona Apple.  Is this her or no?  No.  I don't know why I asked that.  No, this girl's got a really good voice.  She's got a sick voice.  I don't know if I really like it, but she's got a really good voice, though.  She can sing two parts at once.  Wow.  I believe Chick Singer Guy Band. 
[03:11:30]  Am I right?  Chick Singer Guy Band.  Good song.  Well, I mean, good voice annoying song.  Wait for the hook.  Oh, you're thinking the other one they did.  A few years ago.  No, this one's pretty good, too.  Like, she's got a really good voice.  Not bad. 
[03:12:00]  It's okay.  I just, like, kind of generic, but...  I would just turn this off, I heard it.  Would you?  Yeah, it would be a little bit of beep, but a boop.  Goodbye.  Well, the other one they did with, like, some kind of...  She joined up with, like, a Christian rock band in the middle of nowhere, and they had  that massive hit about She's Fallin'.  Really?  Is that the one you're thinking of?  No.  Where they really rock, and the guy's doing kind of a Linkin Park type of thing?  I don't know.  I don't even know the name of the band. 
[03:12:30]  It was a massive hit, like, two or three years ago on the rock charts and the pop.  I mean, it went across the board on all the charts.  You know the song if I...  I'm sure.  Someone help us out on Instant Feedback.  I'd know them if I heard them, but I can't name them.  But that's the one where...  And these guys came out of nowhere.  They just teamed up with her, and she gave them a massive hit.  It was one of the biggest songs of the last five years.  I don't know if we're going to find it, because I don't know what the...  You got it, maybe?  Look at Travis working with Bill there. 
[03:13:00]  And by the way, we might have a...  Love Connection?  Well...  Travis and Bill, what?  No, there may be a song that gets stuck in Anthony's head.  Oh, no.  Getting a little inside info.  Oh, really?  Someone is ratting you out.  Ratting me out, are they?  And you just got the wave.  I can't wait to hear what song gets stuck in your head.  I don't...  And you can't deny it, because it's coming from a very reliable source.  And I've said it gets stuck in my head. 
[03:13:30]  All right.  All right, you got the other one?  The mass...  All right, this was the monster hit that Evanescence did.  Right?  That put her on the map.  Bill, I can talk over the...  Did she do the theme for Halloween?  You know the song.  Jimmy, I bet you know the song, too.  I don't know it yet.  Let's start...  Break me up inside, thanks.  I don't know it yet.  Oh, I know this one.  It was in Lincoln Park.  People say it was in Lincoln Park.  It wasn't.  I don't know this song. 
[03:14:00]  I've never heard this.  It was a Wicked Park wannabe.  I don't know this song.  It's either, right?  I've never heard this.  I don't know this.  I've never heard this.  I don't know this.  You don't know?  No, no, I've heard this.  Why'd you say it kicked in the forest?  It hasn't kicked in yet.  I haven't heard this.  I might have heard this.  I don't know this.  Now you know it. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  The band is 12 Stones.  Right?  I think it's 12 Stones. 
[03:15:00]  That's coming in a lot.  Enough or...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I think we know which one this is.  Truck loads and boat loads more than your share.  Who's a singer from 12 Stones helped out after Evanescence recorded it, yeah.  Yeah, Paul McCoy.  Is that?  Oh.  I just read it on my...  All right.  I say it like I know it.  You do authority.  Yeah.  You know what we could get away with if we wanted to?  We just read and didn't say, oh, that doesn't...  You know how many jocks do that?  I know.  Oh, yeah.  Trust me.  We try to keep it as honest as possible. 
[03:15:30]  You guys give us the answer to some stuff that make us look really smart, and we don't  have to give you credit.  We can look like geniuses.  Oh, I know that guy.  Sure, sure.  It hurts sometimes, because you see right there, you're like, oh, I could look real smart  right now.  Yeah, but can't take credit.  Nah.  Just in case it's wrong.  All right.  Here's the song that gets stuck in Anthony's head.  This song?  Uh-oh.  Coming from a reliable source.  Does he like the song, too?  Oh, man.  What?  Let me see.  He could have been thrown under the bus. 
[03:16:00]  I got a shaky hand.  I'll be honest with you.  I'll be honest, because some songs get stuck in my head, and I don't like them.  Some get stuck, and I do.  All right.  This gets some grow on me in Anthony's head.  Oh, this goddamn song.  Holy shit.  Yep.  This fucking thing would stick in my head all day.  You never heard this one?  Did it drink when?  No. 
[03:16:30]  Wow, I don't know.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Who does this?  The beat?  You have the worst kind of shit.  What an awful song.  Tony the Beat?  How does this not get stuck in your head? 
[03:17:00]  It gets stuck in my head all day.  I'd be walking around, and I was going...  Oh, it's so...  It gets trapped in my head.  The band is called The Sounds.  See, I didn't even know the name of the band.  I don't know the name of the song.  Tony the Beat.  All I know is it would stick in my head like glue.  What a queer song.  Yeah.  Cowbell Bill.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Bill.  I see on the screen here annoying songs, but it looks like maybe we're checking out some 
[03:17:30]  songs that you like.  There are a few, yeah.  It started out annoying.  All right.  Well, Dave opened an idea a couple of months ago.  Carmine Apiece.  Guitar Juice.  Thumbs up?  Thumbs down?  What?  I didn't get to...  Wow.  Now I gotta be...  I know.  Bill called me up and told me to check this band out, and I never did.  I just saw him walking down the street the other day, Carmine.  He's dating the radio chick, right?  Apparently.  Carmine Apiece.  Yeah, it's like seven guitar gods that got together with Carmine Apiece. 
[03:18:00]  I've called them all my life.  And there's some pretty cool shit on it.  There's one, I think it's called Killing Time.  It's about Kurt Cobain, and it's kind of like a Nirvana song, flipped upside down and  backwards.  All right, Bill.  Very heavy, but yeah, man, you guys could, you know, check it out.  All right, we'll go into the master computer and see if we even have it.  Master computer.  See if you can dig it out.  They're computing.  All right, Bill, thank you.  All right, guys.  All right, bye.  I heard a little bit of that Sabbath with Dio. 
[03:18:30]  The new stuff?  Yeah.  Heard a piece of that.  It's called Heaven and Hell.  Fuck.  Sounds great.  Where'd you hear it?  It was on a station last time we were out of town.  I heard somebody got some kind of advanced illegal copy of some shit, and it really sounded  good.  They're called Heaven and Hell.  Dio sounds amazing, and it's got like an updated sound, but it still sounds like, you  know, that genre.  Real good job.  I want to hear it.  Do we not have any?  I don't know.  Do we? 
[03:19:00]  What do you think, Bill?  Heaven and Hell is the band name they're calling it.  Yeah, Heaven and Hell.  We got to go working hard today.  Good stuff.  I asked Bill, did you find the big George Wembley song?  Couldn't you not have it?  Oh, that blot is.  I wanted to hear that.  How about the other one I asked for?  No, look, he's losing his mind.  Like Mission Control.  He's like the first guy at Mission Control to get the Apollo 13.  Uh-oh.  There's a problem.  Yeah.  That's the same face he's got on.  Bill has a 1980s British rocker hairdo.  They claim to have every song at XM, but time and time again, Jimmy suggests something. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, 1916 by Motorhead.  I got fucking big George Wembley and my stupid iPod.  They don't have it.  All right.  The runner-up.  Most annoying pop song of 2006.  Eminem featuring Nate Dogg.  Why, it's a great song.  What's wrong with that?  It's not annoying.  You know the song?  I like it.  Yeah, Shake That.  Yeah, it's great.  You know Shake That?  Yeah, it's a fucking really cool song.  What's wrong with this?  They're shaking that S on the flow.  This is a good one. 
[03:20:00]  I'm too Caucasian.  I love Eminem.  I can't get into this shit.  Why is there beats on this?  Why were the edited versions?  I'm not. 
[03:20:30]  I like this.  This is great.  More ass than a toilet seat.  That's still a good beat, though.  Smoke hot.  You get the chicks.  We understand.  Well, smoke the trees.  No one's always singing about anything original.  I mean, love songs, you know.  You're beautiful.  You're beautiful.  Why do we have edited versions here at XM?  Can I ask that?  Because there's extreme language channels. 
[03:21:00]  What are they called again?  Excel channels.  Yeah, and then there's ones like, you know, that could be on like, you know, one of those.  Can we tap into the non-deuce channel and get one?  It's so stupid.  Like, I guess 20 on 20, they don't play like curses and stuff.  That's kind of dumb.  Of course it is.  Because it's satellite radio.  Just let the fucks fly in place.  Jesus.  Well, I disagree with that one.  I like that song a lot.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the most annoying pop song of 2006. 
[03:21:30]  I happen to have it in front of me.  Do they not have it back there on the let?  Oh, sorry.  They don't happen to have it on the let, so I have it in front of me, Bill.  Which one?  Now Bill is telling me he does have it, but see, Bill, I'm trying to do a bit.  Oh.  No, wait.  Hold on.  Poor Bill.  We love you, Bill. 
[03:22:00]  Travis is laughing at him.  Danny's just laughing at him.  All just shaking their heads.  I'm sure somewhere there's a half-negro laughing.  Bill, you're doing a great job.  Yeah, there he is.  All right.  He's got to get in there and join in the laughter.  Him and his cricket body, Sam.  Like a wingless cricket.  He's just rubbing his legs together, making chirping sounds in the office.  Yes, Sam.  Bill just whips, because he talked back in my ear.  Nobody else could hear it.  He goes, which song is it?  Yeah, I know.  I heard that, too. 
[03:22:30]  Which song is it?  I'm at a loss.  Oh, my God.  I go, I have it in front of me.  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  We've only done this a million times.  Yeah, come on.  Don't you know this old gag?  Bill panics hits the button that only we can hear, and you hear, which one?  Which one?  Which one?  I have it right here.  Well, did you have the one that I asked you for?  There's no heaven and hell.  Oh, my God.  I forgot.  See?  I heard Eddie Trunk was playing it.  Yeah.  You might want to get in touch with Eddie.  I want it on me.  He eats freely. 
[03:23:00]  He's fucking holding out on me.  He's got an advanced copy.  See, the bit goes.  Here's the most annoying pop song of 2006, and then, you know.  Right, right.  You do that.  But see, today's was going to be this.  Here's the most, uh...  Oh, forget it.  I want to hear it.  All right.  Here's the most annoying pop song of 2006.  Hence, I have it, Bill.  Because, yeah.  See?  We were trying to do something here.  He started his career as a frontman for the legendary police, and he's had an unbelievable 
[03:23:30]  solo career now for over two decades.  His latest CD is a departure of sorts for the rock legend.  Good enough, however, to land at the top of the classical.  That's right, classical charts.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Sting.  With the most annoying pop song of 2006.  As the lute comes to fucking lute again.  As the lute.  As the lute comes to fucking lute again.  Oh. 
[03:24:00]  Have you seen what a brightly glow?  Listen to this.  Before rude hands I've touched you.  Have you marked the fall of the sun?  Shut up.  Is this the one to die?  Is this actually the one to die? 
[03:24:30]  He's cool.  Not good.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Why are you?  I've smelled the blood of the blood of the blood of the night in the pond  Or I've tasted the bag of the beer  Oh, so white.  Oh, so soft. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, so sweet is she.  Oh, so sweet.  All right.  Let's see.  Shut up.  This ain't the one we like, eh?  See, but that's the one I was suggesting.  They can't find it.  All right. 
[03:25:30]  Enough about the loot.  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  How touching, according to the LA Times.  Yeah, well, enough about the loot.  There you go.  All right, why don't we play the number one most annoying pop song of 2006?  This can't be it.  My leather coat comes down to my ankles, gentlemen.  I like the way it looks when I turn quickly. 
[03:26:00]  Before we get to number one, here's Mike from Friday Morning Quarterback, FMQB.com.  A great sight if you're into radio.  Inside radio stuff, I guess.  Hey there, Mike.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Welcome aboard.  Hey, last time you guys were talking about the heaven and hell, I looked into it, and the new music doesn't exist yet.  I heard something bootlegged.  I think it was old music that they did.  That was the explanation I was given.  Hilarious.  Was I bamboozled? 
[03:26:30]  No, they probably said heaven and hell.  It was probably the song.  No, I heard it because he was talking about it like it was the new stuff, and it was like ripped off from the studio or something.  Oh.  That's what I heard.  Well, their label has no clue about it.  They have no idea when the music's coming out.  It's not on any schedule or anything.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir?  How do you feel about Iron Man being used in that Nissan commercial?  I haven't heard it, but I don't have a problem with it. 
[03:27:00]  Why not?  I mean, it's a 35-year-old song or whatever, so it's proven itself as a great heavy metal song.  Why not?  I mean, if they can make some more money, we'd let them.  I have no problem with that.  To me, that's not selling out.  Sabbath rocks Nissan.  They're the same guys they've always been.  Yeah, they just come from that era of bands that don't like to use their music in commercials.  I'm just wondering how you felt about that.  I don't mind.  Let them do it.  Why not?  It's good.  I'm sticking here on faggity music and commercials.  I'd rather hear something I liked, finally.  Yeah.  Hey, Mike.  Thanks for posting the Baby Bird video, by the way. 
[03:27:30]  Man, you don't know how many people have called me up just saying, I can't believe you guys put that up there.  I can't stop watching it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's horrific.  It's really taking on a life of its own, that video.  My boss comes walking into my office.  He's like, do we really need that up there?  I'm like, oh, yeah, we do.  Of course you do.  Yeah.  When was the last time anyone did anything on regular radio that warranted anything?  Jesus.  And it's such a visual thing that you can't describe it without watching it. 
[03:28:00]  Exactly.  All right, Mike.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Bye.  FMQB.com.  Here's the number one most annoying pop song of 2006.  By the way, no way this is her voice.  Oh, Paris.  No way.  There's no way she has this power talent.  This is called, um, Stars are Blind.  The new thing to do is to rip off Gwen Stefani. 
[03:28:30]  You notice that?  It has a little Gwen Stefani in here.  Yeah, a little bit.  Fergie's doing a little Gwen Stefani.  La, la, la, la.  And Gwen Stefani stopped doing Gwen Stefani.  Right, right.  La, la, la, la.  I don't like this.  You could really hear the machines that were cranking to keep that pitch right. 
[03:29:00]  The machines that work.  Oh, my God.  How did her album do?  All right.  Better than they thought.  Santa's name comes out.  They weren't expecting to, you know, sell a million.  Just goes to show you what they could do in the old.  Yeah.  It's a recording studio.  We might see her fat pussy get a finger in it, though.  This has nothing to do with her voice. 
[03:29:30]  Nothing.  Just some breathy shit.  It's all effects.  I want to be a singer.  Her voice is dubbed a million times, probably with others that could actually sing.  Yeah.  She's in there somewhere, maybe.  Yeah, maybe.  La, la, la, la.  Yeah.  La, la.  All right.  That really is awful.  I like that song.  Well, we actually did the number one song, huh?  Yeah, I don't want to be predictable, you know?  I don't want to be predictable.  I don't think we should be predictable. 
[03:30:00]  I knew.  Are you handling it, Dalgley?  Huh?  Two songs on that list.  Ooh, did you?  Really?  Christ.  Man.  I heard a bunch of them, I guess.  Pop.  Ew.  She's pretty, man.  I wouldn't mind giving her the business.  The business.  Really going out on a limb there, Jim.  Yeah.  Comes with a little fold-out book and everything, huh?  Look at pictures of Paris.  All right.  What? 
[03:30:30]  What?  Oh, yeah.  Ooh, let's see who this is that doesn't know him on the fucking radio.  Jimmy Norton's got a call.  Hello?  I have a number.  Norton residence.  Hello?  Mwah, mwah, mwah.  Hello?  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  Hello?  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  I cannot hear you.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  Ooh, I don't know who that was.  I don't know what they want.  I don't know what Merle does.  Call that number back.  No, it's private.  I hate when they do that.  Ooh.  I just heard on sports radio an athlete was driving an Escalade drunk and that he got in 
[03:31:00]  an accident due to the fact he was watching porn and jerking off while driving.  And?  See, that's old news.  We've heard that already.  We already talked about that.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, isn't that old?  Then we'll talk about the old lady's sex blog.  We got an update.  You know who the athlete was?  It was Joe Pappertone.  You know, I really didn't enjoy that airplane ride.  First class is very overrated.  Why?  What did you like about it, Uncle Paul? 
[03:31:30]  I love it.  They didn't have any of the drinks they wanted.  My favorite drink they didn't have.  And what's that?  I like warm papaya juice in a can.  I don't think they would have that.  Small, thin can of warm papaya juice.  You said you were a fan of the Shirley Temple.  No.  No?  No.  Why not?  I don't like it.  No?  He's the creepiest guy ever in the airport.  He's sitting there and looking at small children that are running by and giving them little 
[03:32:00]  names.  There was a blonde kid that I leaned over my girlfriend and I went, look at TJ.  He loves to play.  TJ.  And what was the other one's name?  Antony.  Antony.  He was heavy or fat.  A little tight.  Jay and Antony.  And she said I was whispering to her on the plane as Uncle Paul.  I figured what I said.  And she said, you know, that makes me physically sick when you do that.  Yeah.  She was really getting disgusted with you.  She couldn't even play along anymore.  That fucking I'll flirt back with him shit went out the window as I knew it would. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, that went out the window.  Of course it was.  You always got to find the one point.  She hates when he laughs.  Like when he says something like racing laughs.  Yeah, like we would play strip poker, but I would always fix the deck.  Wow.  Four hours later, Joe has something to say.  Yeah, Joe.  What's up?  Yeah, Jimmy, dear.  Yeah, right here.  Crickets don't have wings, Jimmy. 
[03:33:00]  They do so.  Crickets don't have wings.  They do.  Jimmy had a, no, they do not.  They do.  I've, I've, I've studied crickets.  I, I was an entomologist after college for about eight years.  Jimmy, crickets don't have wings.  What about the African crickets?  Sir, yes, the African cricket has wings and it flies.  No.  People think it's a bat, but it's a cricket.  How does, I, I, I, wait, let me think now.  I gotta assume crickets have wings.  They do, just to wave at people.  Let's see.  Dan, what are you looking at? 
[03:33:30]  Crickets are friendly.  I saw you're pointing at something.  It's like a picture of a cricket wing.  It's a picture of a cricket wing.  I'm looking at a cricket wing, sir.  You ever see ants disassemble a cricket and like one of them is holding the big wing,  bringing it down the hole?  Yeah.  Ant goes in the hole.  I think, uh, fan.  I think fans are on.  Female.  Hold on.  I'm looking at the female and male wings of a grill-less field cricket.  Yes, they do have wings, sir.  The cricket, dude, what the fuck are you talking about?  Yeah.  You are stupid. 
[03:34:00]  And you waited four hours to try to correct this.  You call up with something that you think you know about and you're stupid.  I waited five minutes and crickets do not have wings.  How do you, where are you getting your info?  Weren't we talking about cricket wings earlier this morning?  Or did you bring it up again?  No, I said Sam has got his cricket legs rubbing them together.  The guy's a dope.  That guy, if you know that man, please smack him in the face.  But an open hand over the mouth smack.  Just a bitch slap over his stupid mouth.  Uh, let's go to Nolan in San Antonio. 
[03:34:30]  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, Nolan.  Uh, listen, I just had a question for little Jimmy Norton.  Go right ahead, Nolan.  Uh, I needed to know if, uh, I needed to know the name of that lube you recommended.  It's Eros.  It's a big black bottle.  And, uh, makes things nice and slippery so they don't cry as hard.  So it's a bottle?  Yeah, it's a big plastic bottle.  Black lube.  There's different ones, though.  All right, you go ahead.  You know.  I'm just trying to explain to you what it is.  But you just keep filling in the blanks. 
[03:35:00]  All right, go ahead.  Big plastic bottle.  And there's different ones.  There's ones for latex.  I forget which.  Bodyglide is the one I like.  Bodyglide.  Body.  Eros.  Bodyglide.  Body.  I think I found it.  Thank you very much, sir.  Good luck, sir.  Stroke that cock gently and yet a firm grip on the head.  Need a new name from Brooklyn.  CokeLogic's contest submission is great.  Okay.  All right. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  What does that mean?  People just send cryptic messages like they're in the middle of a conversation with us and  they'll just type in the end.  Oh, Future Menendez knows what it means.  Go ahead.  I think that's a reference to CokeLogic's video submission as part of the video.  All right.  Where can we see this video?  Is it up on the website?  Steve is here to clear everything up.  It's up on Open Anthony.  Oh, wait.  Can you hear anything on this?  No. 
[03:36:00]  Why don't you explain what it is, man?  No, just please.  Just an animated Uncle Paul video.  Oh.  And it's done very, very well.  Oh.  I didn't see that.  I'll show it to you.  And it's up on OpenAnthony.com?  Sure is.  All right.  Cool.  I love those animations.  All right.  You can check it out for yourself on OpenAnthony.com.  Bill, get us out of here for a little bit.  Will you?  No.  This young lady is flashing her privates.  Whip them out Wednesday with Open Anthony.  A bunch of girls flashing their boobs, which is cool.  Wow! 
[03:36:30]  Open Anthony!  This sounds like Andrew WK.  Yeah, right?  Wow!  It's time to party!  Fucking Jimmy. 
[03:37:00]  Calls it out.  I think you just got some respect from the booth, too.  They all gave you the thumbs up.  Is that him?  Yeah.  Oh, it is him.  Hey, Jimmy, you doing a commercial that we didn't know about?  Who was?  Mike on Long Island.  Mike?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, there, Mike.  Hey, Jimmy.  I just want to let you know that there was an HBO commercial I just saw.  I was listening to you guys, and it's for the 30 years of NFL.  It's a special, I think, that's coming on HBO soon?  Oh, yeah.  I was at the Lucky Louie party or whatever, or the Entourage premiere party.  What did I say?  Yeah, congratulations or something. 
[03:37:30]  Actually, I don't know.  I had to unmute because I was listening to you guys, but I just want to let you know  so you can look out for it.  Yeah, I was just walking through the whatever.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, so you just tip a little face later.  All right.  Just walking through the whatever.  Whatever.  Hey, Dan in Manchester has something, but where's Steve?  Get Steve real fast.  Dan in Manchester, New Hampshire.  Uncle Paul video equals genius.  Worthy of a YouTube series.  Can we see it?  The video is up on opianathlete.com. 
[03:38:00]  We can't see it on this computer.  Can't see it.  You've got to see it in here at the same time.  Yeah.  I'll check it out as soon as we get off the air.  Audio visual.  But it's...  Steve, that's part of the video contest.  What are the details again?  We're running out of time, right?  We only have like a week, week and a half left?  Yeah, next week we vote.  The 15th?  How many are you getting in?  His eyes real tight.  I'm thinking I have to shed my eyes, lest I be distracted by a trout or something.  I put a cheat sheet under my lids.  That's right.  How do you know?  Yeah, we vote on the 15th. 
[03:38:30]  Opian Anthony related video, two to three minutes in length.  It can be animated or videotaped or filmed.  And you can get it to us through email, which is on the site, or...  All the details on...  All the details on opiananthony.com, sponsored by hotmovies.com.  Or send it on a postcard.  $1,000 grand prize.  Okay.  And so far, CokeLogic is...  So far, he is really in the lead.  Really?  Any others worth posting on our site?  Not really?  Oh, boy.  Oh, the Dancing Baby Jimmy by Pappy is up there, too. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, yeah, that's pretty good.  I saw that one.  Yeah, those are the...  I like that one.  Two frontrunners.  Caricatured and cartooned.  Yeah.  And a lot of people are loving the Uncle Paul video.  I got to check it out.  We'll talk about the...  It's an all the gentleman.  Gentleman.  He is.  Okay.  Hey, remember the old lady's blog from yesterday when we were in West Palm Beach?  Of course.  Talking about sex with the elderly.  How it...  Why should it stop into the...  They said 60s, 70s, 80s.  Even 90-year-olds should keep sexually active.  But they do have certain problems, difficulties, whether it's diseases or impotence, things like that. 
[03:39:30]  You know, the elderly.  What was the one about...  Cracked hip.  What was the one about the cement?  Oh, yeah.  That Viagra isn't a bag of cement.  Or a cement...  Oh, man.  But she put it eloquently.  Yeah.  Something about Viagra cement filling you up.  Whatever.  Cement holder, was it?  No.  No.  No.  Sack of cement? 
[03:40:00]  No.  You know how you get an old lady to suck your dick?  When she's having a heart attack, you just dip your helmet in nitroglycerin and stick it under her tongue.  You know what?  Double-edged foot, she'd be there going, hmm, what do I do?  Oh, both of us.  Way to follow up my accident.  What were you rubbernecking?  You plowed right into me.  Okay, terrific.  I know. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, you fucking drove head-on into that wreck.  I was looking at something out of my side window.  I was on the cell phone texting.  Always feels good to bomb with company.  I hate bombing alone.  It's a carpet bombing, yeah.  Anyway, we got into...  Better to go out with a squadron.  Hold it.  We got into this old lady's blog yesterday.  Had a lot of fun with it.  And now she's really pissed off, because we told the pest maybe they should check out this blog.  Check out the blog?  Were they able to leave comments? 
[03:41:00]  Oh, yeah, they were.  Oh, well, we're...  Oh, no.  They're gone, unfortunately.  We didn't get to them fast enough.  Oh, goddammit.  What then?  You don't know how many printed out?  No, because as soon as I checked it, when we got back off the plane, she had already...  They were wiped.  By one o'clock, actually.  Wow, that was quick.  Sure, she's not fucking.  She might as well do this.  Yeah, well, Thanh sent out this email this morning.  Apparently, the pest found her page all right.  Unfortunately, it looks like she nuked all the offending comments.  It doesn't seem like all of FBA Whackbag's full might has been brought to bear yet. 
[03:41:30]  Her latest blog below.  So, it's headed here.  Who called in the creeps?  Oh, no.  Who called in the creeps?  Send in the creeps.  She said that?  Yeah.  That's the title of this posting.  Who called in the creeps?  I apologize profusely to any readers who were subjected to the nasty and profane comments  that were posted to my blog in the past few hours.  I wish.  I wish. 
[03:42:00]  I know.  Someone must have them.  Someone has them.  What did they write?  The gang at Whackbag and FullBlownAids.com.  They got them.  I want to know the names of the people that wrote in, and I want to know what they wrote.  Send them in to Thanh or Steve or somebody.  Who called in the creeps that were posted to my blog in the past few hours?  I'm deleting them.  It may take me a while, so there must have been a lot.  And those posters, I imagine it's one person with too much time on his hands and too much 
[03:42:30]  meanness in his heart.  Nope.  Sorry, lady.  And then she writes blank, blank, whatever that means, is no longer welcome here.  And then she ends it by saying, wow, this really surprised me.  Joan.  Well, Joan wrote to Whackbag, too.  She wrote to Whackbag, I have a question about whether some of your members are in violation  of these rules I find on your frequently asked questions.  Oh, I forget what it was, but she said, apparently there was something today on today's Obi 
[03:43:00]  and Anthony show about my blog.  I'd love to know what was said.  Perhaps you can tell me.  No, you wouldn't.  Oh, you don't want to.  What?  No.  Which led to one person posting my blog address on your board and several members colluding  to disrupt it by bombarding it with comments.  They laughed, as you put on the board, when I discovered what had happened and I posted  an apology to my readers, which caused them more guffaws.  Guffaws.  Especially when they recounted my efforts at removing their comments.  Oh, Joan, you're not making this better. 
[03:43:30]  Hey, we got an update on her website.  Update.  I discovered it was not one person, but several, in an organized attack on my blog, led by  the fan message board of a shock jock radio show.  Shock jock.  The listeners apparently found the idea of joyful senior sex icky and set out to trash  the old lady's sex blog by posting more than 40 extremely obscene racist sexists.  A-G-E-I-S-T. 
[03:44:00]  Ageist.  Ageist, thank you.  Thank you.  And offensive messages.  Oh, please, somebody send them.  Oh, I gotta know.  Well, we got three comments coming back already.  Patricia Philbin said,  No need to apologize, Joan.  Whoever made this attempt to trash your page is a sick individual slash s individuals and  should seek professional help.  Good day to you, ma'am, and I enjoyed your fancy advice on sex at an older age. 
[03:44:30]  Patricia Philbin.  Patricia Philbin.  Oh, is that good?  She also unfortunately set it up so that she approves all comments now.  Well, that's fine.  They'll still get through.  Hence the Patricia Philbin.  Yeah, as long as the names get through.  Joan Price writes, thanks, Patricia.  Chris Smith wrote a nice piece about me in his column in the Press Democrat today, and  I had many new visitors.  I hope they realize that I was sabotaged today, and they don't stay away because of what they 
[03:45:00]  read before I got to it.  I've changed my settings so that now I'll moderate all comments before they appear.  Sorry, it was necessary.  Fuck.  Joan writes again, personal note to the creeps.  Okay, boys, hope you're done playing with yourselves and each other, because we're done reading.  This isn't my first time at the rodeo, boys.  Where'd it go? 
[03:45:30]  They have to make the jokes and the names now.  Yeah.  Did you think it would be difficult to find out what computers were posted in the comments  and which website was egging you on to visit the old lady sex blog?  How does this bitch know anything about computers?  Took me about...  Boy, is that annoying me.  The old broad actually tracked down where they were coming from?  Yeah.  She writes, took me about 10 seconds, even with these old eyes.  They probably put whackbag.com.  Yeah.  How'd she find out?  You know what?  Yeah. 
[03:46:00]  We had our fun with Joan Price.  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't recognize the voice.  What?  I don't recognize your voice right here.  No, at times you gotta do the right thing.  Who is this?  Who is this?  At times you gotta do the right thing.  We had our fun with the old sex lady blog.  Yeah.  Joan Price.  And I think we need to get her on the show tomorrow and apologize like gentlemen.  I really do.  I'll agree.  You know, that would be the nice gentlemanly thing to do.  Can we get Joan Price on the phone?  Well, sure as heck try.  Yeah, let's try. 
[03:46:30]  And here's what I think how this should be presented, because this is how I feel personally.  We talk about a lot of subject matter on this program.  Her blog came up.  We spoke about it.  And a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch, because we had a great educational discussion on the whole thing.  And a few people take it to that limit, because they don't understand whatever it is.  But we would love to have her come on our show.  Absolutely.  We will apologize on behalf of those bad apples, and maybe get a little bit of education. 
[03:47:00]  Look, we'll admit, we were immature.  Yeah.  We were just trying to have fun.  But now I think it would be interesting to find out what happened to her blog.  Exactly.  How much of a pain it was.  And then find out maybe more about this old lady sex.  Excuse me.  As I burp.  Old lady sex.  We gotta do the right thing on this one, guys.  By the way, Jay Peterson writes on the Instant Feedback.  Jay Peterson.  He's from Whackbag.  He writes,  All the Way May made a few appearances referring to Joan as Old Dusty Cunt. 
[03:47:30]  Old Dusty Cunt.  All the Way May wrote that.  She should talk.  And Chester's Lever, you know him from Whackbag, he writes,  I know Robert Reed sent a message saying I would fuck you.  Hold on.  But.  Motherfucker.  It's updating because now everyone wants to, I don't know.  Oh, maybe.  Okay.  Saying I would fuck you and help you lose weight at the same time. 
[03:48:00]  They chimed in.  Let's see.  Animals.  Yeah.  This guy from his cell phone writes,  I posted as Ron B and told her I want to throw a cowbell in her cunt.  How about that, Fez?  Chris from Oklahoma City writes,  I think Patricia needs a good deep dicking in her bippy.  Oh, they must have been. 
[03:48:30]  Let's see her try to do, try to gape, do a little gaping and her asshole rips like rice  paper.  Hey, go to the smoking gun.  Get this story for tomorrow.  Oh, what do we got?  That's, that's a good one if that's true.  Oh, we already, what happened?  How about that?  Right there.  Oh, ow.  Oh, you got it?  Throwing things.  Holy, what?  What happened?  This just fall from the sky from God?  What happened?  Dude, I just saw like a really interesting story someone is sending in on instant feedback. 
[03:49:00]  I'm like, that sounds interesting.  We would do something about it.  I go, get that story for tomorrow.  From the sky, here it is.  It was right there.  Here it is.  Was that a fan?  No, it was God, dude.  Because Danny, I think, came running in at the same time.  No, it was God.  Travis actually got the story.  Travis got it, and Bill was the one that put it together.  Kill you all.  All right, hold on.  Fantastic.  Oh, wait.  Yeah.  Has she updated her blog at all again?  So, can we get her on the show tomorrow, Joan Price? 
[03:49:30]  Love to.  Yeah, we really got to do the right thing.  We had our fun, obviously, and now we got to do the right thing.  And we could maybe learn a thing or two.  Hey.  What?  We're not opposed to that.  Yeah.  Audio from CokeLogic's video entry.  Mm-hmm.  The animation is terrific, but he did an Uncle Paul animation.  It's part of the video contest.  All the rules and details are on opiananthony.com.  But here's the audio portion of the video that I can't wait to see right after the show ends. 
[03:50:00]  You're such a good girl.  Excuse me?  I used to babysit you.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I used to bounce you on my knee when you was a little kid.  Your father got really mad at me.  Bounce you on my knee, give you some potato chips.  Kissing it back in the neck.  I had a niece who was a bit of a tattletale.  She was two years old, and she made up allegations about what I would do when I was babysitting.  How do you know my family again?  I worked with your father, and I got fired.  Oh.  You know, your mother was always an attractive woman. 
[03:50:30]  Your father and I had an argument one time.  Because he said I was being inappropriate towards her and you.  Do you have a family of your own?  My wife was killed in a fire.  I got an insurance settlement.  She was burned over 92% of her body.  I took care of her seven years.  I never stopped making love.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's okay.  I'm an older gentleman.  I'm 58 years young.  57, actually.  I'll be 58 in March.  Oh, let me get this. 
[03:51:00]  Pull down your underpants and pick up the telephone.  From a tickle to a diddle, he's right there in the middle.  Watch out for Uncle Paul.  When a bounce on the knee is a repressed memory.  Watch out for Uncle Paul.  All right, listen.  Not only is this going to win the whole thing, this is going to take off on the internet as well.  That's a good one.  Coke logic.  I want to see the animation with that. 
[03:51:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  You like that, Uncle Paul?  No, I think a lot of it was taken out of content.  A lot of it was made to look like it was rather salty language.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  When I was a younger man, you didn't talk that way with a lady.  No, no.  You had her malted.  Then you brought her home.  Treat him with respect.  Talk to her.  Hey, can I get to some of the other comments that were left on the blog there?  Oh, my God, please.  Yeah, but I don't like that.  The senior sex is very nice.

Yes, I'm thinking the Pal Talk people called it the great room.  That's where they do their celebrity chats.  I forgot you have a mansion.  No, it's just the great room.  As I'm still living in one fucking room with all my stuff piled up.  I'm going to have to get a log and put it in the fire and actually have a fireside chat.  I'm going to dress like it's 1940s and I might not be American. 
[03:57:00]  By the way, they started the speculation.  Wouldn't that get – do you think Pal Talk would mind if I dressed like Hitler on the camera?  Oh, God, you've got to do that.  Just a big Nazi flag behind me.  Or wear like a Girl Scout.  Holy shit, that'd be funny.  No, put like all Rainbow Coalition shit around behind you.  A big pink circle flag.  I've got to do something.  The painting from that little movie that you guys quote all the time. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, what?  Goodfellas.  No?  Painting?  That movie we quote all the time.  The Shining.  Oh, oh.  The Afro painting.  You have it?  No, I don't have that one.  The Velvet Afro painting.  Two black feties looking over.  Big toes.  A couple other things.  They're already speculating on Whackbag about the huge Ron and Fez announcement that  goes around today during their show.

Hey, how hard would it be to do Line of the Year? 
[03:59:30]  People are suggesting that.  Oh, God.  Would it be that hard?  It'd be really funny if they were just lazy and took one from the last hour of the last show.  Maybe the last show we do for the year?  We could do that?  Yes.  Not if it's really hard, because you guys are doing what you're doing.  Just one?  Sure.  How about the 85 runner-ups?  You need a few in there.  Maybe top ten.  Top ten.  And let's try to get Joan Price on the air tomorrow.  Oh, we're still on the air?  I thought we were starting our meeting. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  You have a fucking meeting?  Meeting?  No, no, no.  Let's just go.  A meeting with a pillow.  Bye.  Guys, thanks.  Bye.
