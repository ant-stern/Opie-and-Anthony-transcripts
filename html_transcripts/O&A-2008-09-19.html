<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a defiant declaration of their intention to produce controversial, "un-nice" radio.  This was immediately followed by a humorous rant about a coworker's incessant playing of "Working for the Weekend" at 5 AM, escalating to exaggerated threats of violence. Opie then detailed a swollen eye, jokingly attributing it to an oatmeal allergy and suggesting a kiss as a cure.  The hosts announced a star-studded lineup for the day: Bob Kelly, Michael Chiklis (Omar from *The Wire*), and a planned call with Dane Cook.  They briefly discussed Cook's new movie, noting Bob Kelly's exclusion from the project.

A meandering discussion ensued about Spike Lee's *Miracle at Saint Anna*, with Opie offering a disjointed summary after falling asleep during the film.  This segued into a broader conversation about film criticism and the unreliability of reviews, especially without pre-release screenings.  Opie then recounted his accidental discovery of extremely racist websites, detailing shockingly offensive content, including a poem about interracial regret and a KKK online news show. This prompted discussion of their own controversial video, "N-word vs. Nazi," a social experiment comparing the success of hailing cabs in NYC while dressed as a Nazi versus a black man.  The hosts highlighted the video's surprising popularity with black viewers.

The show continued with updates on Jim Norton's show, Anthony's tumultuous breakup and the "hostage exchange" retrieval of his belongings from his ex-girlfriend, and A-Rod's expensive divorce. Jim Norton shared his investment portfolio woes, including a disastrous cancer drug investment, sparking a discussion about the inequities of divorce law. A chaotic segment featuring intern David and porn star Lisa Sparks played, accompanied by a bell ringing every time David inappropriately looked at Sparks.  Lisa Sparks' enraged husband confronted David in the studio, resulting in David's panicked exit.

A significant portion focused on intern David's anxieties, including a frightening encounter with aggressive coworker Pat Duffy, fueled by a prior positive interaction with Lisa Sparks.  David's father's discovery of the show's website, specifically videos like Pat Duffy eating a cockroach, and potential legal ramifications were discussed.  The show also featured a conflict between David and Hip-Hop Ron, stemming from professional jealousy.  David's background in broadcasting and accounting was highlighted.  Studio guests included Robert Kelly, discussing *Ghost Town*, and Michael Chiklis, extensively discussing *The Shield* and *Eagle Eye*.  The show played audio clips from *Independence Day*, focusing on Judd Hirsch's performance.  "Ask the Jew," with David awkwardly answering questions about Jewish customs, and the "F-U Line" featuring angry listener voicemails, were also included.  Ricky Gervais called in later, discussing *The Office* and his career.

A phone call with Ricky Gervais followed, covering the creation of *The Office*, bad jokes, and cringe-worthy moments. This was followed by a call with Michael K. Williams (Omar from *The Wire*), who discussed his career, including *Miracle at St. Anna's*,  *The Wire*, his character Omar, and the impact of his character's death on fans.  The conversation touched on various topics including the *M*A*S*H* laugh track, Bob Crane's death, and Williams' early career, including his work with Tupac Shakur. Dane Cook was mentioned as a future caller.

Comedian Jim Norton joined the show, with the hosts examining an unflattering photo of him.  The conversation quickly became sexually explicit. They discussed a photo of Norton with 50 Cent, leading to anecdotes about their encounters.  Norton shared his theories on Tupac's murder.  Michael K. Williams discussed his new album, mentioning Jam Master Jay's influence and the challenges of learning to rap.  A delayed call with Dane Cook eventually happened, covering his role in Bob Kelly's movie (which was cut), other movie roles, and working with Alec Baldwin.  They criticized the film's poster and briefly mentioned Orny Adams before Cook’s departure.  More raunchy jokes followed, touching on Canadian cannabis use and Michael K. Williams’ experiences with Omar’s death on *The Wire*.  Williams played a song from his album, inspired by Barack Obama's campaign, and discussed potential video appearances.

The show then devolved into a largely unrestrained, vulgar conversation involving an unidentified caller, government spending, urinating in pools, unpleasant sexual experiences, a tangent on necrophilia, and highly offensive anecdotes.  A studio audience member with unusually large testicles was briefly featured.  Pat from the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and Big A were present and heavily mocked for their weight and appearance.  The conversation included the caller's plans to see Dustin Diamond.  The show concluded with final vulgar jokes with Michael K. Williams before a physical altercation broke out among audience members.

[00:11:30]  because you know we're in a good position with michael k williams we could just talk about the  wire the whole time well yeah but he wants to probably promote news yeah and we go oh yeah and  you're in this movie by the way um the dane cook movie my best friend's girl yeah yeah there's  no ratings on rotten tomatoes.com and it comes out today yes oh maybe they didn't release it for  review yeah that's exactly what happened there was no there were there were no screenings of this  how many movies is dane in this is uh this is gonna be the 10th in a row when does his uh deal 
[00:12:00]  with the devil run out i'm guessing does it uh run out at some point i'm guessing but a lot you know  what though comedies man i'll say there's a lot of comedies you can't judge by what the critics say  because they always smash them jimmy i usually agree with you but when they don't uh have screenings  up and and the movies coming out and no one has seen it no no critics have seen it that is not a  good sign yeah that is a really bad sign uh well you got kate hudson but she's starting to to like 
[00:12:30]  be a disaster in hollywood yeah because that fool's gold she did with matthew mcconaughey was i i hear i  never saw i did was a complete disaster it sucked did you see it oh yes i did why would you see that  movie i had to ah that's yeah fool's gold don't have to anymore and that's why you're single  that's why i'm able to just sit and watch the matrix now there you go 40 percent on miracle 
[00:13:00]  this is getting miracle of saint anna 40 it's an odd it's an odd movie i love spike lee it's not a  typical spike lee movie at all and it looks like it's even shot differently it's just yeah yeah it's  a different type all right it's gonna be totally different type of movie italians against the  blacks okay that's a good no they were for each other okay oh okay then it is different no they  were working together and there was uh some of the the german do it there was i will say though  there's some really good shooting in it um you know i mean there's some really good germans lose 
[00:13:30]  again i hate that part i don't remember what part of the war it was i think it was towards the end  of the war yeah all right well i went to a few websites last night that were pretty interesting  really i get dragged into going to certain websites because i start off let's say i start  off on fark i go to fark.com and i see a thing on um uh gun control and obama and whatever you know  a lot of political stuff's up there these days so i check it out and then there's links and i go here 
[00:14:00]  and there and before i know it i end up on a horrifically racist website and then i'm there for  hours just kind of laughing what'd you learn last night um there was this uh song or poem  that was written about a young white girl that uh hooks up with um a black guy and uh has nothing  but regret through all this poem oh my god it goes on and on from her point of view they have kids 
[00:14:30]  together and she says awful things about the kids being a mongrel children and uh that she could never  go back to the being a member of the white race and right right oh my god and i'm just going through  but apparently uh like the aryan nation and the kkk are really kind of um not getting on the the black  uh on black people's asses these days as much as they are the jews wow do they hate the jews 
[00:15:00]  holy mackerel i think the jews have always been number number numero uno on the uh on the hate list  they blame them as bankers yeah they do have some interesting cartoons on there that just look like  they came off of the uh propaganda poster from 1938 and so you're saying they're the stairway to  heaven oh as far as uh racism it is uh wow no but i there's also um a uh the ku klux klan runs a 
[00:15:30]  little uh television news show that you can get on online so i was watching some of their programming  and it's just two people i i guess their background is the capital and it's a guy a man and a woman  and they're sitting side by side like a news anchor like news anchors they're really bad they can't  talk there's an echo going on the lighting is horrible but they try to make it look like a news program  and they just talk about how awful uh the situation is between blacks and whites and uh they don't use 
[00:16:00]  the n-word but um the one guy did say um uh he called a black gentleman uh nigra  nigra yeah yeah yeah because he's from down south oh so i guess that's how he would say he's saying the word  but um no he's probably saying negro actually negro yeah yeah yeah but that's how he says it  like grand old opera it's grand old opry yeah okay those southerners kind of have their own  little twang on things but they were talking about um hate crimes and how uh it's never called a hate 
[00:16:30]  crime when it's a white guy attacked by a group of black people and then it's always a hate crime  the other way around no matter what the circumstances are and uh they kind of got into that it was  something it's like real they don't get very profound it's just very surface very shallow  kind of delivery on all this stuff but um really kind of funny to to watch because uh you know  especially if you're you're not um somebody akin to be being brainwashed uh if you just sit there 
[00:17:00]  and watch it at face value it's hysterical because you're like oh my god they're just as bad  can we uh uh put any of this on the radio i don't know i i watched one episode about the um  the hate crime thing but they have a bunch of archived episodes it's right there on um  well you know where where else would the ku klux klan have their website i'm sure you could figure  out their uh their um url yeah anthonycomia.com and they got links to everything and you can buy uh 
[00:17:30]  you can buy little uh ceramic figurines they look like little hummels but they're of ku klux klan maybe you  maybe you shouldn't say they have links to everything well yes it's just saying it goes  directly to foundry just saying you know you got dragged into those uh websites there's a video we  made that is that that has hit all those websites oh wow what the um nazi it's a great video but it's  doing very well because all the all the people out there that love to hate are enjoying the hell out 
[00:18:00]  of it is it the one where i was pitted against patrice yeah yeah hail a cab patrice being a black  man that that video got way more views than uh a normal opian anthony video and i started doing some  research and you realize that those communities really took a liking to the video wow and they're  passing it among themselves it was uh uh hiling a cab yes we called it and i had a um an authentic  nazi helmet on right and um patrice was dressed kind of gangsta like yeah and we went out on the 
[00:18:30]  streets of new york city to try to see who could get a cab if we both walked out at the same time  and put our hands up patrice put his hand up like he was hailing a cab and i stood there uh at attention  giving the old uh sig heil to try to hail the cab with my arm up wearing a nazi helmet and i wound up  getting more cabs than patrice could as just a black guy on the streets of new york well black 
[00:19:00]  people have had a tough time getting cabs here in new york it's gotten better in the last few years  but still they really cracked down on him so we had a social experiment yeah it was a black guy and it  was anthony as a nazi and uh of course it was called something else well yeah it was uh n-word versus  nazi uh n-word but uh the gga yeah yeah like the gangsters call it yeah you know what though that is a  really even though it's a it's a it was fun funny for us to do because you know it was a great  experiment it was a great experiment but the comments uh that oh yeah because then we go along 
[00:19:30]  with the video are are wow because the cab would pass patrice by uh and then stop for me and then i'd  i'd go in and go wait a minute did you see the the black guy over there i go i'm i'm wearing a nazi  helmet and i was sig heiling to hail you down and you stopped for me but you didn't stop for the black  guy that's like 20 feet behind me or uh next to me uh and and usually they would panic and say no  i did not see him and then drive off patrice's 6 11 yeah how did you not see him it's it's a great 
[00:20:00]  video i don't know if we'll be able to link it i don't know why wouldn't we that's just that's we  really should stump rain we should link it and say it was our social experiment it really is let's get  something done today all right black people love that video like even though the name of it is what it  is it's like the black people probably look at that go exactly yeah i don't know why that was  my impression of being the black guy exactly all right we got to take a break jimmy went to yankee  stadium for the last time it looks like last night with stunt brain i want to hear about that how that

[00:30:30]  just sit it's all about long term long term gains my friend like i do though what do you invest in  most guys don't do anything widgets they put you into some most likely safe stuff and then you have  to sit it out sit it out for a bunch of years what do you invest in like the guy like what's his  name morning joe probably probably like a wick factory that makes wigs like morning joe if you feel  like taking the yeah i'll buy if you feel like taking the chance jimmy tell him to get a little  more aggressive with your money they said to put more money in soon like to start buying and stuff  just get more aggressive we got a we got a guy he's as conservative as they get and uh we're long 
[00:31:00]  term guys after my portfolios trust me trust me jimmy it could get a lot worse my portfolio is down well  over a hundred thousand dollars well over it's it's others i have dell in there that i bought at  22 or something like that what's dell nowadays yeah exactly and a bunch of other things i i have a i have  a uh an effing cancer drug that was supposed to cure breast cancer that was supposed to like 
[00:31:30]  set the world on fire i got in uh but double digits that thing is a penny stock now no oh my god  oh this guy uh this shyster this boiler room uh stockbroker this this guy was basically one of  those boiler room dudes that i you know i learned since then but this right this goes back to when  we're at anyw and they were handling the merger that was going on at the time and uh and i i thought  he was trustworthy and he got me in this uh cancer drug that that's supposed to cure breast cancer 
[00:32:00]  oh brother this is eight years ago and what this thing is dead what are they waiting for dead like  many women because they didn't get the the drug are they saying that they thought they were gonna  have doesn't work or the fda won't approve it it never took off this was a biggie to work do it take  off and it yeah of course of course i i got had is what i'm trying to tell you jimmy you know what  you invest in um i know i've gotten this i'm so lucky to have gotten this email from nigeria 
[00:32:30]  apparently there's a lot of money over there and i just gotta send some bucks over to uh have it  shipped over here yeah yeah there you go nigeria's got a lot of money apparently hey go stop literal  jim hey going back taxes before we uh move on to other things because it's it's uh it's kind of  important uh how did a rod get a divorce within two months he opened up his vault and let it spill out  all over her is that what that's what happened that's that's all it's about what did she get in 
[00:33:00]  this so if if you get a guy that's so wealthy like uh a rod and he's willing to take a boatload  of money and throw it at her the divorce is over right no time if it's the guy that wants to you  know keep what he he he made of his own talent and hard work and not give it to some freeloading  bitch and uh those are the divorces that go on and on and on for years and years and years and years  and uh i'm reading the article here listen to this if this doesn't piss you off anthony today 
[00:33:30]  are we allowed to say that if we get yeah yeah okay uh in her divorce petition cynthia cynthia  rodriguez 35 demanded i demand the couple's 12 million dollar waterfront estate in coral gables florida  holy mother of god and equitable uh distribution of all assets acquired during the marriage  she demanded not asked for i demand the hell did she do to get a 12 million dollar waterfront 
[00:34:00]  you know mansion they should have just put her in during the postseason because she probably would  have done better i'll give her that god but you know these divorce cases and these divorce lawyers  you're brilliant aunt can you imagine all right this woman thinks she deserves half of what a rod's  making we suggest your honor that she uh plays uh ah we'll even throw her in right field what we  demand she plays right field for the yankees yeah for a three-game series and let's see how if she's 
[00:34:30]  worth half of what a rod is worth if she's good if she catches one lousy fly ball out there we'll give  her half yeah she demanded anthony is that amazing it's um is that amazing how long are they married  a few years i don't know how many years one kid too i would guess no more than five or six tops  right something like that something like that two kids married and caught cheating pretty much or it 
[00:35:00]  looked like he was cheating that's a rough one oh yeah to get over that's a rough one it's not it's  not a rough one where he should lose half of what he made no but infidelity i'm just saying in a court  that's that's a really brutal a lot of times it doesn't have any bearing really infidelity the  reason for the divorce has no bearing on the distribution of assets i know that  uh yeah it doesn't matter what the the cause was yeah uh it's just you know you get a divorce and 
[00:35:30]  that's it it might weigh with it doesn't even weigh with the judge or anything that like i said it's  all a mathematical little formula they figure out and uh if you settle before the judge figures it out  then it's over that way and i guess he was willing to cough up all that money he's you know he's got a  nice chunk of change yeah but believe me doesn't matter how much you have you're not happy doing that  yeah i mean uh well and then he's got kids so now he's got this tie with her thank god 
[00:36:00]  do you imagine thank you god for keeping my little swimming spermatozoa away from her egg  could you imagine because if i had to have any dealings with her on a weekly basis to see a kid  could you imagine could you no bring bring him back i i wonder if they're ever going to change this  whole thing with divorce no everyone knows the guy gets screwed and and every time we say this a few 
[00:36:30]  women call up you're the exception trust believe me you're the exception of the rule well you know  i was the one that had to pay yeah yeah okay yeah we'll acknowledge there's a few out there that have  to pay of the female variety but in general the guys get screwed in these divorces we were talking  to someone a couple days ago about divorce yeah and this person said you just got to stay married  yeah he goes he goes you know how many people are just are just staying married because they can't 
[00:37:00]  afford to to get divorced and and get happier that's healthy so they so they choose to just  stay in a miserable situation because they just can't they can't afford uh uh to be out on their  own and to go through a divorce you have to choose two types of misery either being with somebody you  really can't stand to the point where you want to divorce them and can't or the misery of making  money but not being able to enjoy it spend it the way you want because you have to shovel it over 
[00:37:30]  right to somebody who is just not deserving of that amount of cash right uh those are your choices  have fun with it there you go and another example today a rod's wife is just uh reaping the benefits of  what a rod did what a rod did lotto it amounted to her her girly parts were a lottery ticket right  it was a scratch-off ticket right a rod used his uh he didn't use a quarter he used something to 
[00:38:00]  scratch off yeah and uh and don't be confused i think you know i think a woman deserves something  you don't want to throw them on the street with nothing but yeah but uh there's there's some of them  you do but somewhere yeah of course but somewhere but somewhere in between obviously yeah there's  no in between a rod's wife should not be able to demand a 12 million dollar waterfront mansion in  coral gables florida what the f did she do what for what exactly exactly oh disgusted speaking of uh 
[00:38:30]  the yankees who are so out of it it's not even funny are they mathematically out or are they just uh  not yet ah them win last night yes they won they're pretty much uh they're they lose one  more basically and they're and they're done stop they're so done they're out of it but everyone's  going to yankee stadium because this is it for the uh the old stadium three more games with  baltimore we get the we get the dumb pull out today baltimore end of an era yankee stadium opened 
[00:39:00]  april 18th 1923 close september 21st 2008 the new stadium you can see right next to it and it is  cool looking man i gotta be honest you look at it just it looks like a really old retro stadium  oh yeah that's what they're doing these days it's nice yeah it's gonna be a great place to see a you  know see a game what are they doing with the old they're gonna knock it down right they have to i'm  assuming they got to get some parking and whatever else put new stores up and stuff all that all that  crap yes and of course we're losing shea stadium as well but no one cares like they care about 
[00:39:30]  yankee stadium they just don't have the history there it's just an asshole that that shea stadium  has been the worst stadium in the majors for a long long time i remember crying in shea stadium  because i had to make uh weewees and daddy took me to the bathroom and um and i couldn't like i i the  crowd is in there was so like so many people that was i was being pushed away and i was like  just a little cry baby well you know what you were you were two feet and a big thing of tears 
[00:40:00]  a big tear big tear duct giant tear duct with little feet you walked around wrecking everything  for everybody i did i made everyone's time crap with my crying uh poor anthony oh no no no no more  poor anthony at all no now instead of crying it's just look the other way go home and hold a gun  psycho yeah all right let's say hi liquids from other parts of the body 
[00:40:30]  that's true yeah he doesn't point doesn't have enough fluid uh left in his body to actually cry  anymore dehydrated but other people's uh let's say hi to uh charles in south carolina charles  hey good morning boys good morning charles going back to that uh divorce uh jeff gordon got divorced  a few years ago and uh his in his defense he uh tried to use the fact that he risked his life 
[00:41:00]  basically to get all his his assets and his earnings and his wife wound up getting his house  in florida the learjet the yacht and she got actually the wait staff and everything and uh i guess  he got caught messing around with some playboy model or whatever but i thought it was a pretty  good defense saying that he he risked his life every day to he does yeah that's how he makes his  money i mean we do this break all the time i understand that but what what is it going to  take for for for the court system to change their ways i know who's very vocal about this is alec  baldwin he's like he yells and screams about this every chance he gets i think he wrote he's writing 
[00:41:30]  a book or has written a book on this how he really wants the laws changed how about every other  guy out there wants the laws changed a female vice president hey there you go there look how look  at what you've achieved over the years you don't need us to support you anymore how about breaking  through that glass ceiling you know we have you want to break through the glass ceiling uh do it on your 
[00:42:00]  throne after a divorce get yourself a job uh and work for your own money a j-o-b right uh speaking of  uh female vice president so a little uh mess up on fox and friends if you're a democrat are you a  democrat first or or for example a woman first that sees a breakthrough i mean there's no there's  a huge breakthrough here that regardless of your party correct if you're asking me i i think the idea 
[00:42:30]  that she would appeal to hillary voters you know the pro-choice versus not seems to be a much bigger  issue than you know she has versus she you know has another body part that men have  they uh they got away with saying uh the t word for the breath who said that who uh i don't know some  guests they i don't have his uh oh uh carolyn can't read the last name from bloomberg news said it 
[00:43:00]  carolyn boom or bomb or something like that bomb brown i can't read eroc's uh writing all right  we're gonna take a what i think it's bound i'll do some bloomberg columnist uh i think the last name  was baum all right very cool uh it's opian anthony phone number 877-212-0&a we got robert kelly coming  in studio in a few minutes here he got cut out of uh the dane cook movie we'll talk about that we got  michael chiklis coming in within the next hour i think after the break we got the audio of intern 
[00:43:30]  david with the david with the husband thing that we were describing yesterday and the and the porn star  all hell breaking loose we got some fine clips of that i think we should maybe uh revisit that  after the break sure opian anthony  cell phone and pda users send your message to feedback at opian anthony.com  opian anthony it's just a disaster are now back  and we're back with the opian anthony show robert kelly joining the program he was almost in the 
[00:44:00]  new dane cook movie i'm hearing that uh what happened what happened we need the story let me  tell you something this this week yeah i would have been in two movies wait you're out of both of  them i'm i mean no i'm in ghost town but i don't really say a lot i'm in a lot of it but i say like  two things but i'm just pretty much a dumb ghost walking around the background the whole movie  but this but that's kind of cool yeah it was cool but ghost town's getting really good reviews by 
[00:44:30]  the way is it that's the ricky gervais movie that comes out today yes thank you  thank you it's getting really good reviews and if you're on if you're in it a lot that's not bad  well that's a nice spot i was standout actor in the movie was a comic named robert kelly  construction worker number three yes wouldn't that be great oh and then what happened with  the dane cook movie well the dane cook movie i had a big scene with him and kate hudson like a big 
[00:45:00]  scene i was the strip club manager i you know i i got to make fun of kate i called her a four and a  half really yeah all kinds of cool stuff naked girls everywhere it would have been a great scene that  way people would have went to see they would have had to see me this i would have been two films this  weekend and uh they cut me out and i how did you find out dane had to call you i i'm telling you dude  i'm i'm not gonna say nothing but i think it was some you know let's put it this way all the people 
[00:45:30]  he got in the movie cut out really so what's that about none of his friends can act that's what it's  doing the right thing getting you guys all a chance to be in the movie and then in the end it uh didn't  work out none of my friends can act either you know what robert maybe uh you don't want to be in  that movie why and i know dane's a good friend of yours but there were no screeners uh screener copies  of this movie comes out today no one has seen it yet really so so they can't even review the movie  and traditionally that's been a really really bad sign and we all love dane cook on the show but it 
[00:46:00]  has to be said that this is going on right now but should it traditionally anything i'm in that even  if it's a stinker i stand out there you go traditionally who else did he get in besides not  me oh he actually yeah exactly why can't i just do one line of this movie what's the matter with him  you could have why won't he do it just call me go ahead just my buddy yeah say why can't  jim be cut out of a movie too hey i don't care cut me out of course i care uh jimmy made it  jimmy made it into the kevin smith movie of course i did i'm good when is that coming out i don't  know actually it's got to be coming out soon are you good in the movie uh people say he is really

[00:56:00]  point of going hey my boobs are over here because he was looking he was actually good though because  he did keep talking he had a question for everything he didn't stutter and not talk i mean you know it  was oh yeah now um this is where we got to fill in the the big blank because it got so crazy over  there we really can't uh replay it over here yeah but uh it went from the get to knowing uh get to  no stage to there was some stuff going on well you know she admitted she has a husband but the 
[00:56:30]  husband's back in kentucky and she doesn't care about him there was there was uh uh david's i think  really i don't i don't believe what he says but i think this was his first time of really touching  and caressing a woman as he did on this day um uh spots that uh you um normally don't touch on you  know mom maybe when you're kissing her says who yeah exactly cans like this you bet yeah 
[00:57:00]  get it over here yeah so he was he was really getting into it she at one point they were sharing  a chair together uh he was sitting in the chair taking up all the space in it so they couldn't sit  next to each other so she had to sit um on his lap oh uh and apparently he enjoyed that very much  oh yeah from what she said and uh things were going on yeah things were going on she was kind  of chair dancing at the same time oh yeah yeah and we it built up it started off slow but he was 
[00:57:30]  really really getting into it and he thought he was safe he thought okay her husband's in kentucky  and she doesn't care about her husband and he he went for it right it oh right oh yeah  and do we need to say anything else before the next but no i think that that's pretty much it  all right then we then we surprised david with this you're going to say something i'm just saying  that i'm just hoping the husband comes in and then david takes his glasses off and has superhero 
[00:58:00]  powers and just kills everybody in the room big j on his shirt  able to leave tall banks  well this is uh this is what happened as as david was really getting into it  spank her you could spank her just a little tap  you want me to show you how to do it  she'll show you see she doesn't mind it at all she likes it  exactly yeah keep spanking her  can we always get back to this

[01:07:00]  oh my god look you gotta here's radio you want to be in radio right correct here's how it works  you have to now describe what he found offensive without it being against the rules of radio and  hey shut up i'm talking without it being against the rules of radio or the company rules but but you  have to now paint that picture let the listeners know exactly what he found offensive and uh  it's not so much offensive it's just he found a certain video quite disgusting to him okay 
[01:07:30]  was it rich ross's act no not that video that video not that video has nothing to do with me  okay which one he saw a video a video a certain intern doing a certain thing and got grossed out and  like oh you better not do that something like that was it pat duffy being vomited on  it was with pat duffy but not it was when he was pat duffy was eating the the cockroach  don't what are you saying that for pat's here oh pat's it you're not supposed to say that dude  he was my dad saw that i was like oh you better not do anything like that why would you say that

[01:10:00]  connecticut schools of broadcasting it's called the csp now csp now not uh not cbt that's different  yeah they're trying to they're trying to they're trying to be uh like kfc cbt you you told me what  that is what is what is cbt something all right right right yeah um how long is college david how  long is this cbt uh cbt i see uh csb oh geez i actually didn't do that on purpose csb an accent 
[01:10:30]  yeah csb it's just a short it's a short program i mean the actual uh it's just you can go on that's  what yours is going to be do they know what you're doing in your big fancy school  they know that i'm they know that i'm interning here i don't know if they know that i've been  on the air or they know that i'm here do you want to be on the air behind the scenes or just control  all of it do they have that course there yes you know what that course do all of it no the um how 
[01:11:00]  how jealous are those of the dumbbells in that school be knowing that you've already had porn star  giant breasts in your face they're probably really jealous you you're really at least getting known  and do it's amazing some guys that come on the show and they don't appreciate it it's like do you  understand this is not an easy place to get in radio where you can come on and just they're going  to use them in all the commercials yeah hi i'm david i'm david and hi yeah i am a csb graduate 
[01:11:30]  and i was placed at opium on the opium don't try to add in yeah exactly when anthony's improv and  you can just smile yeah yeah and laugh okay i'm kidding you can jump in of course you're not and  david you're not here to be david i like you david you'll be dead now if it wasn't my david  you're not here to be funny david i like when david interrupts anthony  some reason when anthony's talking david  area 51 area 51 you know the spaceship more judd harris oh yeah why don't we have that from 
[01:12:00]  yeah get the area 51 clip please god he couldn't have been worse we really got to take a break so  we'll we'll see what the problem is with hip-hop ronnie and uh and you have a yarmulke on david  no you should have one on you should pay attention to this part of the show because when you uh  finally uh completely fail on the air and go into sales radio sales uh you'll know what the  commercials are all about okay all right all right more with intern david uh are we doing ask ask the 
[01:12:30]  jew today uh ask convention we've we huh did we ever get the i don't think we got the answers to a  couple of questions we it's very good because we're kind of learning a lot about the jewish culture and  uh the what religion what the culture the jewish culture and religion and uh through david he knows  a lot about it well yeah we so what are the questions today how do bald guys uh yeah it was how does a 
[01:13:00]  bald guy keep his yarmulke on right because i've seen the other guys that clip it on with uh bobby pins  and yarmulke clips two is uh grab the mic stop standing the sheet the sheet what why do they have sex  through the sheet the sheet between them the hasidic the hardcore jews do that yeah and then  you got something with a string that hangs out of a pocket or something like that so you got the  answer to all these yes i do all right we'll find out next michael chiklis here he's coming today  right uh he'll be here in about 20 minutes oh good 
[01:13:30]  this is a very special show it's about being able to do the show we want to do  give it to me we know what guys want to hear on the radio adult oriented subject matter look at  those jugs  exercise restraint this is gonna be an awful show hold on tight  we got a busy show michael chiklis we'll be in studio in a few minutes uh here we got robert 
[01:14:00]  kelly in studio he's in the new movie ghost town is one of the ghosts getting 78 positive reviews on  rotten tomatoes.com and then uh i'm cut out of here he's cut out of the dane cook movie so he could have  had two movies that he was in this weekend oh well skyrocketed that would have been my big hit  too that could be uh my best friend's girl because you had a big part in that oh well a nice part right 
[01:14:30]  a talking part people were like who's that guy yeah like they did with jimmy and spider-man slow and  steady bob that's the way i look at it that's it slow and steady mother always said it's a marathon  not a foot race  oh good gosh  yes mother was very wise  yes  we got the judd hirsch uh area 51 rant  ah  this is from uh independence day where judd hirsch uh does one of the worst roles of his career  as um uh 
[01:15:00]  the father  uh of jeff goldblum  goldblum and he is so over the top jewish i don't know what he did like he did he screen test  and they just said no you got to really jew it up more and uh he just it's so over the top it's  distracting i wonder if he made that choice like uh because he is judd hirsch i mean you know i don't  think he screened judd hirsch they probably just gave the role yeah wasn't he jealous of andy 
[01:15:30]  kaufman's success during the taxi years oh maybe i don't know i mean i i read even though he was  very funny he was very funny but andy kaufman outshined louis killed all of them but yeah louis  did yeah you're right about that yeah uh here's judd hirsch uh with the rant area 51 you'll be dead  now if it wasn't my david none of you did anything to prevent this there's nothing we could do  we were totally unprepared for this ah don't give me unprepared come on it was what in the 19 what  50s uh whatever you you had that uh spaceship yeah that thing that you found in new mexico that 
[01:16:00]  thing that you found in new mexico roswell roswell mexico yeah no you had the spaceship and you had  the bodies they were all locked up in a in a bunker where was that david i don't know area 51 right  area 51 you knew then and you did nothing you did nothing and you did nothing my head is tingling  it's so bad my head is tingling it was a little movie so what's the big deal a little independent 
[01:16:30]  film his awfulness and that and then we didn't know we didn't know all right mr president  i'm gonna go up i'm a pilot that's what i do i'm gonna fight with my men you're the president dummy  oh yeah that's it so the president put on his flight gear and went up and uh uh you know fought  the alien ships i blocked that out yeah i swear to god that's so that that is so abysmal 
[01:17:00]  i blocked it out i was raped that speech though that speech to the president oh very this is our  independence day one of the most inspirational speeches in any movie inspired me to throw up  that's about as inspirational as are you gonna make us get that speech that speech will inspire  51 anybody you know as well the 50s are new mexico in the 50s new mexico you had the bodies the ship 
[01:17:30]  the spaceship you know then and you did nothing what are you doing judge well we didn't know that  we didn't know i didn't know that'd be sounding like pacino we didn't know  uh god what i don't know why i'm so fascinated now with a friggin 15 year old movie but the most  recent one we've talked about it's just been on cable so much lately and i for some reason 
[01:18:00]  i'm compelled to watch it we do this from time to time we did it with twister so maybe this is the  new twister yeah i gotta go see this movie again gotta go see it like it's still in theaters i gotta  go rent it or whatever twister it's coming this way it's already here bill paxton's fantastic acting  and everything he's been in we're doomed we're never gonna get out of this place  let's put her in charge oh the president fought the aliens though that's brilliant yeah he sure did 
[01:18:30]  that's some brilliant writing right who saw that coming like you really would i'm the president  Randy quaid is the over-the-top drunk guy that saves everybody yeah i'm back  that bothers me there are so many douchey lines in that where you just actually get goosebumps of  embarrassment and can't look at anyone harry harry connor jr was in that too he was he was trying 
[01:19:00]  to play oh look see i just got him when they walk to their planes and say let's kick the tires and light  the fires and all these cliche things that i know not one fighter pilot ever says who said that and  they they they like high five and he said harry connor said that i don't why i don't i swear to god  and part of my brain shut down when this stuff happened it wouldn't allow me to remember will  smith goes i'm just looking forward to getting up there and kicking et's ass 
[01:19:30]  see because et yeah yeah yeah that could have been a great movie i remember hating it so much  because it was like really well shot and i'm like conceptually it was good i love the idea of what was  happening the the alien in it was great sorry in there's dave stewart we saw the other day who is  that guy that that was him in front of uh oh who is that he looks like ringo star if he was retarded  he looks like ringo star or eric clapton taking those steroids that jerry lewis had to take or jim 
[01:20:00]  norton with a beard you know my first thought was he looks like me and i just said he was in the  arrhythmics right was he yeah he was jim norton stops doing comedy because he's so famous he  starts painting we saw him outside serious the other day oops was i supposed to say that  you're just walking by oops that's right we were of course so um nothing going on there right oh not  no no no no no hey why don't we get the guys to watch independence day and get some fine clips 
[01:20:30]  for monday's show yeah because it's it seems like there's a lot there there's so many awful clips it  could be our new twister movie you have to get twister we are we were obsessed with and we played  all the clips and and that was a blockbuster man it made a lot of money sure and you look back at  that movie and realize how god awful it is terrible and i'm thinking now independence day is the same  thing horrendous all those extreme yeah man we're tornado chasing bad playing the music  uh we don't need a corporate sponsor like these guys in the black suvs we're rebels really the 
[01:21:00]  president's speech is now on onaradio.com from independence day okay what a great you want to  want to uh play ask the jew real fast before we get michael chiklis in here well where's david david  david we gave him three questions to answer the last time he was here david i think that was  wednesday oh he's wearing his young dumb and full of well we all know he's wearing that shirt today 
[01:21:30]  because he likes the shirt we gave him that's like his security blanket for when he comes in  to do his shtick yeah shtick his shticklach  welcome to ask the the jew well do you have answers for us jew yes i yes i do very good don't  hold back joe we will find out okay okay yes whenever you improv just say things like okay 
[01:22:00]  yes one word answers that contribute nothing it's very noticeable to all of us that this david doesn't  have a sense of humor yes well i think he wants to but he's just one of those people that don't  well let me ask this what do you find funny good question because you obviously don't find anthony  funny because you no you don't laugh you're not picking up on any of the literal with me find  funny the story of easter jesus oh yeah yeah really what do you find funny because anthony's a very 
[01:22:30]  funny man and you're not laughing at anything he does i don't take it i don't take it personally i  understand that it's not that i'm not laughing at now i'm just in a zone right now and i'm prepared  to give these oh he's in the zone he's in the jew zone i'm not really like david what do you  find funny a lot of stuff is funny anthony's a very funny person thank you david no no no no no  what do you find funny what makes you laugh a lot of stuff makes me laugh i don't know like 
[01:23:00]  like uh i don't know comedy stuff all right what comedies do you find funny no just like comedians  on tv or anything all right what tv shows guy doesn't know what funny is what tv shows do you find  funny a lot of them are funny oh my god you don't have a tv do you you don't have a tv david do you  no i have no tv no wait what wow i have a tv oh wow okay well that was funny you got me there 
[01:23:30]  so i have a tv you were when you were a child were you beaten forever like when you were like  were you specific were you beaten for being specific and you've learned never to be specific  about anything what tv shows in particular a sitcom something like that yeah sitcoms are funny sure  but what sitcoms do you find funny all of them are fun oh no no all of them are not funny anthony  we're we are so on to something all of them are not funny i don't think he knows seinfeld is funny 
[01:24:00]  seinfeld a fellow hebrew that's a funny show you find that funny yes uh what other sit  wait wait anthony i think that's universal because it was easy to say seinfeld because  the pressure is on him what did you find funny about seinfeld all right uh all the jokes about it on  the storylines everything is funny say more any more general any episode in particular yes or any  situation in that show that you found very funny uh just the interactions between all the uh oh my god 
[01:24:30]  we're looking for something specific you want me to name a specific episode yes oh yes an episode  one moment that made you laugh on seinfeld um a moment it's easy to say seinfeld is how about the  i'll give you an example and you want to be my latex salesman yes uh look at it goes yeah yeah so  that's an example of a specific thing that i found hysterically funny on the show there you go right now  what about you and don't pick that one oh obviously not i like the episode when they're uh when they're 
[01:25:00]  driving the car and they have to like and they have to like get the last drop of gas you know  that one's funny do you remember that episode jerry and kramer arguing and kramer goes tomorrow jerry and  then jerry's whole callback is tomorrow i don't remember that one all right good i made it up if you  said yes you were a liar i don't think this guy knows what funny is i really don't how about a funny  movie uh i like lots of funny movies oh he cannot be specific just when we want to be specific just 
[01:25:30]  when we want to arrest david he comes up with something new you can't be specific you're not  being like did you find passion of the christ funny um i have not seen that movie of course he booed  i have not seen that movie you just read about it correct all right what bond bonds then heckle the  screen what movie did you find funny david one of my all-time favorites is meet the parents i think  that's a hilarious movie that's funny okay get out oh boy get out 
[01:26:00]  what uh what's the matter up you didn't like that one first one was good the first one was good i  think it's overrated but they say it's the top grossing comedy of all time i think at this point  david what do you like about meet the parents uh the interaction between shut up shut up the  dialogue how about something specific uh i just like the fact that uh they keep on making fun of  his last name they make fun of him being jewish they make fun of him being a male nurse all that 
[01:26:30]  stuff it's funny all right all right all right david what are you doing with your hands david yeah  you don't know what to do with your hands when you stand there do you you got one in the pocket and  it comes out and then you're standing at attention then there look it goes in the other pocket  keep my pockets uncomfortable now you're just dangling by your side very awkwardly what would  you prefer that i do with them oh hey whatever you want to do whatever makes you comfortable back in  the pockets well that's comfortable for me listen we got a we got a big star waiting to get in yeah so 
[01:27:00]  we we better uh move this david thing along so it's uh ask the jew correct yeah uh anthony you want to  take over from here is i i would like to know a jew how the bald jews keep the uh yarmulke on their  head don't lie to me i will know well to be honest with you a lot of bald men try to wear like the uh  the bigger kind of keypods there's like some that are like smaller and like thinner and they like  try to wear the bigger keypods so that doesn't fall off their head so you're saying more surface area 
[01:27:30]  more friction correct it stays on so that's what the big ones if i was wondering what those big  ones were for they're for bald guys correct correct right and they don't use glue no they don't use  glue that that no they don't use glue no all right okay now what about the sheet between the when you  make the uh sexy time with the other another jew um why the sheet well apparently i did some 
[01:28:00]  research and apparently apparently that's not true it's an urban legend it's a myth oh the jew is a  myth no the sheet no the sheet during sexism is a myth it's a legend it's a made-up thing it's not  true that's not required wow it's not required a lot of people think it's required but it is not  required i thought there was something a little fishy about that it's an urban legend that has been  made up okay and why made up to like you know be anti-semitic or something i don't think it has 
[01:28:30]  anything to do with with that i think i think it does i think it has something to do with like the  next question that you're going to be asking me how it's like how like it looks similar like that  thing looks similar so they they made it up and it's not a myth it's a myth it's a myth it's not  it is not a requirement and then no jews use a sheet it's been made up a myth you need to clean up at  the end i don't use it all right uh what about the little strings right this is a it is what i was 
[01:29:00]  saying last time there's like different reasons it's a they wear that to symbolize the different  mitzvahs which i explained to you last time where it means good deeds good deeds good deeds so what is  it like they wear it to symbolize the good deeds because there's certain way like you wear it over  your over you put it over your head and there's four corners it has four corners each corner has  has five has a string there's eight strings and five and and the strings are tied into five knots 
[01:29:30]  wow on each string okay right and those are mitzvahs what's considered a mitzvah wait wait wait wait  oh excuse me excuse me so then so then five five five knots plus eight strings makes 13 yeah now  in the hebrew language the hebrew letters you know what i'm gonna say jimmy no you're looking like  you know what i'm gonna say yeah he does that to make you stop talking yeah he'll for he holds a 
[01:30:00]  finger up and goes uh let me uh let me get in here okay so the jewish in the jewish language  hebrew the letters correspond to number correspond to numbers no so the jewish word for what the  the cloth over your head is called it's called sit sit sit seat seat oh i was gonna dump out of you  for a second there and those letters in hebrew add up to number our number have numerical values and  those numbers add up to 600 uh-huh so you have 600 plus you have 13 which is from the five and eight 
[01:30:30]  on the corners that's 613 that's like one of those lunatics that write down numbers and then 613 is  the amount of mitzvahs that are amount of good deeds that are written in the old testament and do you  have to do all those or something so like a mission originally in the old testament you had to do all  of them what what is an example of a mitzvah a good deed well an example of a good deed is uh is  giving money to poor people is an example of a good deed that must be a rough one  yeah majority of the at least 500 of the good of the good deeds are impossible to do anymore 
[01:31:00]  oh really because they're involved making sacrifices in the old uh holy temple oh boy  anymore there's only one as you know there's only one wall left in jerusalem of the old temple so  half of the mitzvahs are impossible right most of the mitzvahs are impossible right now does it  entail killing people i mean right now we're human sacrificing no sacrificing animals into the  original holy temple which doesn't exist like a lamb or something yeah and those mitzvahs  yeah but that's how you get 613 which is the mitzvahs and it sacrifices remember i mean it uh 
[01:31:30]  symbolizes remembering the mitzvahs and that you should always be uh privy to all the mitzvahs  that you're doing on a daily basis anthony i gotta interrupt this uh just wonderful talk from david  because uh we're we're learning that michael chiklis only has about 10 minutes holy geez we  gotta take a quick break so all right so i think it's time for me to get michael yeah we're gonna  have to get michael in here after the break but uh david um really fast uh you're wrong about the  uh yarmulke you're wrong about the sheet and you're wrong about the strength according to the the jizz 
[01:32:00]  that are calling our show right now so very good well we're gonna have to find out i don't know yeah  opian anthony michael chiklis joins the program next it's the opian anthony show um hope he took off  you gotta go he was swollen yeah he was definitely taking on a rocky dennis look  it's not like jim gets swollen on the show not his eye was swollen it's a different type of swollen  jimmy gets swollen when there's um a certain girls in the studio this was his face and uh he's 
[01:32:30]  supposed to be a doctor yeah we have to figure out how to turn the music down now his stump brain  and michael chiklis is in and already bob kelly is asking questions that he's wrong yeah because it  was on the uh the prep sheet whenever we get a prep sheet michael i gotta apologize  i don't know who puts it together but it's completely wrong well you know and why would  his mic work hold on his mic work we have no one knows what we're doing here hey hey here i am  there you go well you know they probably went to imdb and looked it up because you know according 
[01:33:00]  to imdb uh i have a house in greece and i speak three languages you do really yeah i'm really happy  about you really do no i'm kidding no i'm kidding what am i not good of an actor do you uh do you  look at some of the stuff on the web and just go oh my god what are these people why are they  bothering yeah sometimes man that's crazy you know look i i don't know where they get things i don't  know i guess people talk and it's it's weird they must sit around campfires and make stuff yeah make 
[01:33:30]  it all up and the more successful you've gotten i mean the the shield really put you over the top  uh that just i mean from season one people were really digging that show it it was a whole new  type of uh uh except for regular cable hbo movies like that you didn't see that on basic basic cable  absolutely so you guys really kind of broke broke it open for shows like uh rescue me and other shows  where they you know nip tuck i mean that hard language where you're like did i just hear that 
[01:34:00]  exactly you know was there any concern when you went into it that there's going to be problems  well you know my first question is are are we going to do this really yeah look because if the pink  pages come down on the first day of shooting and it's like a boiled version of this i quit i don't  want to write right but if we're going to do this i'm in and uh peter lugori and kevin riley who are  heading up fx at that time went no man we're we're either going to fall on our asses or we're 
[01:34:30]  going to do really well that at least pages by the way the rewrites oh jimmy thank you jimmy a fellow  actor so people know yeah um that you know you see a great script and all of a sudden the next day  the pink ones are it stinks yeah and then they take all the all the teeth out of it right that  happened yeah that's why it was that's why it was pretty unique to uh to see something like that  you know yeah it was crazy as a matter of fact they you know they just said look you only have  this much money to shoot it you only have this much time to shoot it but go yeah and hey we were 
[01:35:00]  cool with that you know what's cool about it is it it wasn't some big budget show no but it had that  realism the grit to it and stuff that well you know innovation you you know it's you you you have to  make do with what you have and the fact is that that's one of the reasons why we shot it the way we  did we made it look like a docudrama because you know we had two two cameras and a butt dolly  we didn't even have a proper dolly we have something called a skate dolly which is a 
[01:35:30]  like an octagonal board with some like roller skate a little a little bumpier than that yeah so we just  thought you know let the clark johnson's brilliant cat man he directed the the pilot you know clark is  right from a homicide life in the street and you know he's he directed swat and he's really  amazing talent in any case he directed the pilot and he you know he wanted you know the camera to  be like a another person in the room right and he created this sort of docudrama look which makes it 
[01:36:00]  really visceral makes you feel like you're in the room with us you know it's very cool way to shoot  a show the uh i guess the whole show's wrapping up though huh yeah this is it seven seasons like i can't  amazing seven yeah you know time flies when you're having fun yeah we had a great time shooting this  show we it was really life-changing for all of us um tremendous amount of attention we you know 
[01:36:30]  essentially created a network change yeah yeah change some things up in the business and you know it's  cool to be kind of part of something historic like that but uh and also i'm kind of spoiled because  i've been playing vic mackie for seven years it's not every day you get a role like that you know and  uh so i'm kind of like looking at stuff and going really really but i will say i got lucky uh you  know i got this cool little part in this spielberg movie uh you know um he produced this movie called  eagle eye eagle eye right yeah and it's very cool movie and shia labeouf is he's the real thing man 
[01:37:00]  the kid's cool yeah what's the gist of the movie this is them all god this is the movie that i've seen  promote nimax yeah man it's heavy that looks fantastic where it's uh you have 30 seconds to  leave the room like that creepy call right exactly well you know you'll never look at your cell phone  or your computers or you know your credit cards the same way again i actually i heard him in an 
[01:37:30]  interview talking the cia guys were there yeah and they were like can you really do all the stuff  they do in the movie and they played him back a phone call he had on his cell phone from a couple  days before they just recorded it there's some crazy yeah he's been around the campfire he's you  know he's making uh you know i almost swore uh he's making that's all right making stuff that's  what no that's i didn't say that uh shyla said that in an interview you're making it i swear to god  i don't lie jimmy lies i'm a catholic shia labeau said it on an interview yesterday yeah well actually 
[01:38:00]  you know man well you know some of what was really cool is i played the secretary of defense  in the movie and we shot at the pentagon oh really yeah and you know i it was trippy i got that's got  to be a little rough to get the permits to do that check it out i actually flew in and landed on the  green of the pentagon in a black hawk helicopter in post 9-11 was that unbelievably cool we're walking  us around the the bowels of the pentagon i turned to this five-star general and i said general you got 
[01:38:30]  to tell me how did this happen he said to tell you the truth it almost didn't we weren't going  to let this happen and i thought god damn it this is an american film crew in america wanting to shoot  an american film why the can't we do this you know and he made it happen and i you know i applauded the  guy i was like way to go man that's cool it's funny how sometimes if you get some whatever a little bit  of celebrity or as you have a lot of bit of celebrity how people will kind of cut you some slack 
[01:39:00]  it's like hey you you want to see the room where we keep the real films of the kennedy assassination  you know it's amazing i felt like uh you know uh george c scott in in uh doctor strange he's gonna  see the big board you know we went into that room we went into the room where they like you know they  plan attacks in you know yeah it's insane and the it's funky you walk in there and you have a cell  phone come i hear this voice and it's the computer it's it knew that i had a cell phone in my pocket 
[01:39:30]  and i had to take my cell phone out and leave it at the door damn you know it's weird that you know  and there are some iffy pictures on it photos of your own genitals speaking of uh celebrity weirdness  we walked in and you know when you come in you have to show a picture license you know or id  to come into the pentagon and there's hardcore marines up there and everybody in the cast and  crew that's walking in there is pulling out their wallets and i started to pull it out and 
[01:40:00]  and i hear vick mackey is in the house and i look up and the marines like you sir do not need any photo  id come with me thank you you're walking and peeled off the rubber mask  i've gotten in it was very very cool you know that's one of the coolest things about being an  actor's things like that yeah to do like why am i here i don't belong yeah i know someone's gonna  you always feel like you're gonna and believe me i'm not trying to equate myself with on any level 
[01:40:30]  with with celebrity but you do realize but you do it is an odd thing how people do kind of give you  that little leeway or hey i listen you know really yes jimmy i'm actually agreeing with you yeah now  now uh another thing is uh you you've you've had really good success with your career coming from  a spot where you were told by certain uh reviewers that you'd never work again yeah well have you ever 
[01:41:00]  seen some of those i need to clarify something it wasn't reviewers it was the it was the the  business power of the business it's worse what happened that was when he did the first the first  20 years ago now you know yeah yeah i did when i did my first movie i landed in this movie called  wired you know which was a i actually have a great movie thank you based on a book by bob woodward and  you know it just was a controversial mess and i understand you play belushi yeah i understand the 
[01:41:30]  reasons why you know i mean bob woodward's an investigative reporter and when he writes he  doesn't write with sort of flowery forgiving language he writes you know this happened this  happened this happened and in black and white it you know it it doesn't sound very good you know i  mean and it's an it reads very much as an indictment against the people who are around belushi as if they  were somehow complicit in his death right i can understand in retrospect why everybody was so mad you 
[01:42:00]  know and you know listen i yeah it's got to be a certain amount of vindication i can't believe  i'm still talking about this i know no i know the only reason the only reason i bring it up is that  you've had such great success after that so it's almost like like i know me personally i'd be like  hey screw you look you know what i'm glad i didn't i fought that instinct really i think that's the  single biggest reason why that that i i did survive it was i didn't fight and i just went you know what 
[01:42:30]  this is a lot bigger than me it has nothing to do with me if i throw my hat in the fray here i'm  going to get my head chopped off yeah you know i'm just going to work i just want to you know like it  says 20 years i just want to work 20 years ago you just want to do something and plus you know i was  coming from the place that belushi was an idol of mine i love that cat you know i didn't want to  hurt anybody i wanted to play this guy i loved him yeah everyone did i mean well yeah or or and by the 
[01:43:00]  way you know or it was can i tell you the specials for this evening you know i was waiting  tables exactly it's 23 oh man play belushi wait tables huh what restaurant was it at different  mindset formerly joe's on west 4th street in the village it's no longer restaurant it's not it's  not around anymore no apparently you made the right decision yeah i think i did by the way can i call  myself out like when you when you said you were in the pentagon and i said like yeah you don't belong 
[01:43:30]  you're like what am i doing here that was an implication that i have been in similar circumstances  i just what a phony i am i was booted off the set of two girls one cup  oh great but my your career though i mean you played so many different you played the commish  then curly from three stooges which is a hard gig that's a tough one that was a tough you know  especially being from massachusetts and you know you're from medford you know we're hardcore 
[01:44:00]  three stooges fans and curly was god it you know we're honestly a good tell me if i'm lying  a good day after school was when you came home and there were two curlies and a shamp oh yeah if  that was like oh yeah a good day if it was like two curly joes you wanted to kill you oh if you saw  like wow wow wow wow wow wow wow and you went oh shamp or curly joe besser yeah i like shamp with old  i like shamp too but that shamp was good no when the stooges started getting old though and it was 
[01:44:30]  like i think they're gonna hurt themselves they started making some movies and mo's hair was all gray  yeah most hair actually came off yeah yeah you know so it was you know when you play someone  like that an iconic guy you know like curly you know it was pressure absolutely but i just  i felt really good about it because i threw myself at it and you know what we shot that in  sydney australia have you guys ever been there go are you single the only place i want to go like 
[01:45:00]  out of this country right now is australia i'm not single but i'll throw this ring out a window  for a good whole house any day how much is it wow is our money is our money good over there a lot  of girls over there as per guys or something yeah it's very overweighted in that way yeah i mean it's  yeah it's just a beautiful place it's unbelievable it really is the only problem is it's so damn far  away but the yeah the australians are cool people man they're really laid back because anything that  goes wrong the first thing out of their mouth is no worries mate it's the first thing they say 
[01:45:30]  you know so they're like we'll fix it you know you're like okay cool you never saw an australian  guy just snap no what are you doing this stinks forget it i'm out no never what are you doing  and then there's like thousands of miles between the cities too aren't there like it's not like you  can just go from sydney to some other city without getting on a plane and like doing a new york to la 
[01:46:00]  or something yeah it's well everybody is on the outer rim of this continent yeah because the middle  is just the middle the outback i guess it's nothingness and it's real in the middle middle it's a desert  there's nothing did you go out and do any of those you know a little yeah we went we went into what  they refer to as the outback but they're they're grand canyon oh okay it was incredibly funky we were in  this all-terrain vehicle and not like an suv like you see in the this was like you know yeah 
[01:46:30]  the bush mobile for three hours on no road and we i was so sick as a dog by the time i got out of  that car because you're like just beat up just killed in the and we got out of the thing it was  beautiful but the guy's telling us there's like 190 different kinds of venomous snake fantastic yeah  you know i mean you didn't want to no worries mate yeah he's like nah watch out for the vipers  mate i'm like you know so you just don't even want to walk away from him at all i'm like hold me

[01:52:30]  movie ricky our movie we've had lovely reviews haven't we getting really great reviews almost 80  percent on rotten tomatoes so far which is phenomenal that's great that's brilliant i i  like i like being 80 you were hilarious on conan the other night too making him bend down on his  knees and taking photos of his own show i can't believe he did it twice twice you made him do it  twice a grown man in a suit he's about six foot six he doesn't need to do it he spent a long time  on his hair the last thing he wants to do is crawl around a carpet he's got that bob's big boy hair 
[01:53:00]  so i know it's good it's got a hell of a bounce to it yeah hey how much uh you know an extras is  another great uh thing you did and how much uh like uh emmy millman is it for real when you start  hitting big like you kind of starting out like and then all of a sudden you you're just rocketing  into fame is right is there any of the truth in that i'm leaving town now the reviews are good i'm  leaving town i'm uh well i've actually got to go to the emmy's i'm leaving today um to get ready  for the emmy's um i'm handing out an emmy and uh and uh obviously i'm going to lose about seven 
[01:53:30]  i'm going to leave i'm going to have my name not called about seven times oh no on sunday what  what are you uh what are you nominated for sir um i think um director uh writer actor um producer  what are you jewish reading and some are for extras and some are for the american office  um but i'm also they've put me um in the film category which is a nice promotion but i'm up 
[01:54:00]  against four oscar winners what are you up what the film category well i'm up in the extras special  is actually in the movie category they've put it in the movie category because it was like 85 minutes  long which is nice and it is flattering and we sort of secretly made a movie i was sort of practicing  but then to be put up i'm up against you know ridiculous actors real actors so i've got real  actors who are you up against because i um ray fines um paul giamatti um wilkinson are just 
[01:54:30]  ridiculous they all stink i'm tired of all of them you got a great shot at winning who wants to see  ray fines again it's like we get it oh i like ray fines he was great have you seen him bruges it's  brilliant no but i'm just kind of being partisan because i like you so much well yeah well i you  know i still want me to win more than them as much as i like them if i'm pitched against someone  then i want me to win for example you know even if i like you guys but if we were in maybe a gladiator 
[01:55:00]  arena right and it was a battle to death i'd have to try my hardest you'd have to kill us are you  going to try to look gracious when you lose are you going to like clap and smile like oh i'm glad he  won now are we in the are we in the um gladiator arena now or just the emis  please if you lose one the first one you lose please on camera just mouth the words to someone  he sucks how did he win he sucks because they'll go to you every time i know you've got to but you've 
[01:55:30]  got you've got to choice you either you either can clap and really pretend that you want them to win  which is ridiculous yeah right that's ridiculous you can sort of clap and sort of smile and you and  and that's good okay or you sort of whisper to the person next to you just for something to do  yeah yeah like you're just getting on with your life and then everyone's speculating like what's  he whispering i bet he's like pissed yeah i like it when they really are surprised i always assume  that if you're there at the award show you and you're nominated you want to win so you're not 
[01:56:00]  clapping and happy that somebody else won of course you want to win i mean i go i actually  do go to award shows more than i do other things like this because um it would be a slap in the face  not to i unless i genuinely can't go particularly someone as big as the emis or the globes and things  like that so i always try and go but of course you want to win yeah yeah uh it's the only times when  i'm torn um i thought steve should have won um the bafta because he was up against me and he was  more the comedy character so there i thought it genuinely probably would have been better to steve 
[01:56:30]  to win because um you know he's he's nothing without me and it would be a nice little  steve merchant you mean constantly yeah consistently i'm let down by my cast  i keep proving that i'm what keeps everything afloat and to be honest i think i'm carrying ghost town  if we're being totally honest there was there was one construction worker um that that was  there was like there was like a string of them they they look like um you know have you seen 
[01:57:00]  village people now they look like that yeah i've seen the cowboy walking around or something but  yeah with his with his open chat yeah remember remember the day where you were getting chased in  the park down that hill through the underneath the bridge yeah i got yelled at by the director  that day why would he say because you were on set no we were running down the hill and i was a little  heavier at the time oh did he know i think when he shouted run fatty he was talking to me 
[01:57:30]  i was running down the hill and my arms started flailing and making circles and i just ran by the  camera with my arms like propellers and people were laughing and i was like oh my god i just did  something funny in the movie and then all you hear is him go why did he do that with his arms  and then nobody said to me he said you didn't look fat he said you looked camp  well he actually walked up he goes why did you do that i go i'm fat and i walked away which is the 
[01:58:00]  answer for every question was was that's what i say it's it's it's a disease now it's yeah everything's  a disease i have no responsibility over this i like to eat too much because my brain kicks in and says  eat that and there's nothing i can do about it yeah no one takes responsibility for anything  anymore you could just blame it on a disease get a prescription for it well i am i talk about this  on the new podcast we've got out that i said that there's now with no political correctness you see  with that's gone crazy there's no stigma at all when i was saying i want people to shout me in the 
[01:58:30]  street fatty and the papers picked up on that all the british press are going call ricky fatty in the  street and i wanted to make it claim that i meant all fat people should be abused right not just you  yeah exactly are your podcasts i think they're number one through five on itunes now i know yeah  i know you're huge we've been we've been one to four for about two years now and this new one's  come out and it's gone straight number one so eventually i want to push everyone out the top  ten so it's just my chart just you you selfish bastard it's like when there's a pop band in like 
[01:59:00]  eastern europe that's at number one for 19 years because it's the only the only homegrown pop band  that's what i want to be like so now uh obviously the reviews are coming in uh for ghost town very  good now what um uh have you gotten a lot of offers coming in now more movies well do you know  what it hasn't really changed because i mean apart from this one i've um i've been turning down  everything anyway for about five years and i haven't been turning down films because they weren't  good or they weren't right for me it's just been a no because i've been busy you know i i did the 
[01:59:30]  office i worked on that for three years then extras and i just wasn't looking and i'm still not  looking because i'm doing my own thing the next film that's out is um this side of the truth which  i just finished writing and directing with matt robinson and that's me and uh rob lowe jennifer  garner jonah hill christopher guest jeffrey tamble tina fay it is like the comedy cast of the decade  you know and um that's very exciting and now you're part of that whole inner circle oh my god well i'm not 
[02:00:00]  really part of any circle you know i mean i think you're you're the only people that consistently  invite me into your world everyone else just does it once and then says well let's well let's just  rest let's rest we've talked a little too much what's that new movie about this side of the truth  um it's uh um imagine if the world um was different imagine if the human race hadn't evolved the gene for  lying what would it be like there'd be no fiction no art everyone would be brutally honest  and that it's a very harsh world um and uh i come along and i'm a loser in this world and i'm beaten 
[02:00:30]  up by the world but i discover i've got this genetic mutation and i can lie and so i'm pretty invincible  and i can get anything i want wow that's actually a damn good idea that's a great idea ricky jesus  can i tell you something go on i auditioned for that too did you the guy standing on the thing  screaming oh yeah the guy the crazy guy yeah would you leave ricky alone and stop following him  around to auditions i didn't even know i didn't i where did you audition in you in new york yeah and 
[02:01:00]  i got a nice hot no i got uh yeah thanks no you'd be good for that you'd be good for that i mean the  guy we got was good i'm gonna i'm gonna admit that to you i mean we're happy with what we've got in  the can but it would have been it would have been different and i didn't i didn't i didn't know you  then did i i could in the future i'll pull a few strings it seems like movies would be your thing  because you kind of don't like staying on any one project too long it seems yeah movies are great 
[02:01:30]  because um uh you sort of treat the work slightly differently not that i don't do this for television  but movies really are forever and it seems like you might as well you know really get them right  because you want them to be around like ghost town you know it's it's it's a little movie but  what i think is nice about it isn't the opening weekend the fact that i think it's like a little  perennial classic i think this you know this will play for 20 years hopefully and you know and me and 
[02:02:00]  steve merchant were very conscious of that and i think it's um because i came to it maybe with an  older wiser fatter head on my shoulders and um you know we we always thought we took out jokes that  you wouldn't get in a year's time because they were a cultural reference oh it's a good idea you know  we think that and i think it still stands up i know it's only been five years but i think i think  it'd be around in 20. there's nothing worse than watching a movie that it was a kind of a good movie 
[02:02:30]  that just has references in it like oh brother what are you doing a big yeah a big brother  winners reference yeah it's craig i don't remember craig you have you have this great knack for like  you really are the quintessential not greedy with comedy like you do you did six episodes uh 12  episodes of the office a phenomenal uh finishing two-hour special whatever it was and you were done  and the same thing with extras it's like you never you you always finish like people really want you  to do another season or whatever you never get greedy with this stuff well there's there's a few 
[02:03:00]  reasons for that i mean i've been let down myself i hate this this idea that if something's successful  you've got to milk it i don't know why you've got to milk it that's for other people not for you  i don't know why that it's them thinking that they're sort of milking you not literally that would  be disgusting um and the other reason is you know i you you do get bored quite quickly um but the main  reason is that because you me and steve do it all ourselves we haven't got um a team of 20 creative 
[02:03:30]  producers we don't use other writers we put everything into it it takes us months and months  to write the scripts then we film it then we worry about the font on the back of the dvd  and it's really intense yeah so um you know uh but the payback is the fact that we can put it on  our shelf and say we did that and that's the most satisfying thing the sheer pleasure of having done it  it's funny too everyone tries to get these cringe moments in comedy and you you by far and away are 
[02:04:00]  the the master of just uncomfortability being a douche but i mean like where you really physically  recoil watching when you're alone and you in extras i think the moment that got me the most was when  you're at the award show and the doll of you is giving that awful you have it a lot you have it a lot  that horrible catchphrase and the guy is trying to give this touching speech and it's just  oh yeah great man well i mean i i've always been um aware of uncomfortability but i've never got 
[02:04:30]  embarrassed myself i mean i you guys the same i think that we've got like this sort of shield  particularly if you're a comedian but i feel discomfort for other people and the worst thing  for me is a bad sense of humor if there's a group of people and someone makes a joke and someone else  and then someone makes a bad joke and it goes badly i want to rewind time and go to him don't say it  and i don't know why i feel i feel sorry for the coolest man in the world if you can't tell a joke  i feel sorry for a president if he makes a bad joke i want to go oh bless him he could he could be 
[02:05:00]  bombing the shit out of countries if he makes a bad joke i'm still so sorry for him yeah yeah there's  something very revealing and there's something totally naked about somebody in a social setting  who is trying to be funny and it just gets a zero and there's that cold stammering after and people  just kind of look down you can't look at each other yeah it's just doesn't it actually oh pain  yes physical pain oh you want to breathe deeply just oh i can't you can't shake it off embarrassment  i mean it's just the worst he just reached out for love and everyone in the group went no we're 
[02:05:30]  rejecting you it's a very personal thing yeah i was i was at um at um this dinner party once with um  i we only knew sort of one set of friends and they were all their friends and they're quite sort of  like um uh ranging from sort of like that posh and middle class and up to sort of like 70 year  olds and we were telling jokes and um we we got onto like you know sicker jokes and i told one  particularly i won't tell it now i can't it's it's really sick and then at the dinner they said i'll 
[02:06:00]  tell that joke oh my god i went no they went oh go on it'd be all right and i looked around and i  thought well okay it must be really cool and i told the joke and it went quiet and they went not that  one well be specific i just told the worst joke in the world yeah we embrace our bombs here on the  show oh um they're fun aren't they but that was a fun with the office the office was actually a um 
[02:06:30]  and we didn't say this at the time um but the office was a comedy about comedy it was much more  about comedy than anything else really because um in a social situation that's what people try and  fire that that's what you know um and it's just it is it's the worst it's the worst feeling in the  world to to bomb with a joke well the beauty of david brent was it was so how like completely he would  go he gets it he's having a lot like he you would always point at people who were just deadpan and  god he's enjoying it completely unaware at what an ass he is well and also of course because he had 
[02:07:00]  that added pressure that he knew it was being filmed so he had to be seen to be doing well  because that's all he wanted it for the little eye dart off to the camera exactly looking over at  the camera like a little uncomfortably well i remember we were making the show i mean uh um uh  we were such a slave to the realism um but more we had to keep reminding people that it was a fake  documentary because if you take that away it's it's quite an average boring sort of sitcom where 
[02:07:30]  nothing happens but when you realize that these people um well particularly david brent is doing it  because he wants to be famous it adds the you know the biggest dimension and then when you see  why tim and dawn are sort of being coy it's because they're being filmed it it makes it it you know  the all the free song comes to life in it and it's so important that's a great point yeah because  if you just take it at face value yeah i wouldn't even know what to make of it to face that value it  might be funny but but when you do put it in that documentary uh kind of uh atmosphere yeah i think 
[02:08:00]  it would be depressing more depressing about it because it would just be people that there's no  reason why with horrible jobs and a horrible boss i know exactly and the way david brent would sell  himself the beauty of it was in those moments where you're talking to the camera and just the things  like i want to be okay if they say hey he's a great boss well you know sue me just these little  things you say about yourself it's like god what an ass i know well a couple of it i mean people say  is it based on anyone and it's sort of a frankenstein of people i've met but um one of the um you know 
[02:08:30]  the opening scene where i'm saying to that that forklift um driver you know i don't give uh bad  jobs if a guy comes to me and i make the phone call that actually happened to me when i was about  18 i went along to one of those um temp agencies to get you know to be placed for like weeks in  factories and stuff when i was before i went to college and um he gave me that speech and he and  he called up the guy and goes of course they're over 21 and sort of winked at us like we were sort of  meant to be happy that he was lying to a friend like this is meant to ingratiate it so um yeah 
[02:09:00]  they're all sort of um you know out of experiences but i think that the um the more real something is  even if you just do it on a subliminal level the more payback you get and i just think people  identify with it more i think that's great when you can remember some like one moment of someone  being a complete ass from years ago in your life yeah i suppose um i've always been a sort of you know  people watch it and it yeah it sort of goes in yeah well you get the same reaction from like people 
[02:09:30]  who are watching your work that people get in real life when they do that and i think that's the  hardest part to translate is like you can make me uncomfortable while i'm alone watching it which  is really hard to do well the only time i get apart from curb your enthusiasm which i get that with  i sometimes have to turn away because it's just too much where it's slightly different with him  because he's he's sort of like defiantly like that and like david brent who had the blind spot  um the larry david character in in the show is one of those people that um uh just um won't back down 
[02:10:00]  which is funny but the the times i get it apart from social situations is the reality game shows  two people flirting on a reality game show honestly makes me want to cut my own head off  there is nothing worse when they think they can't be heard and he's sort of like doing these lines  it make up oh my god it's just nothing more but and someone singing a song you get these people going  to big brother or what and they and they want to be a pop star so they sort of like singing songs all 
[02:10:30]  the time as well as they can and you want to it's so cringy isn't it i love the fact that you probably  induce more cringe than anybody yet it bothers you so much when you actually see it for yourself  because mine is fictional we do we create these superheroes and villains so no one really gets  hurt whereas these people are real they're really doing it it is true though i hate when you're walking  through new york and someone's just see some dude just singing like some broadway song because he's 
[02:11:00]  you know he's an actor and he wants people to know that he sings oh i always i quite feel sorry for  those actors that are dressed as teddy bears giving out leaflets though because they wanted to be  playing check up at the national but yeah someone going you know you know we were just talking to  michael chiklis and he you know did the whole stint as a waiter that's kind of the stereotypical  what does an actor do before he makes it uh thing i think that's better though yeah i think it's better  to work in a bar or be a waiter than than do a you know dress up yeah yeah you know i just try to get 
[02:11:30]  your 15 minutes and hope it lasts longer because everyone's got a um a mobile phone with a video  and it'll be on youtube when you're the biggest star in the world you're you'll get on youtube and  you'll be um clucking around like a chicken handing out leaflet dress like a piece of gum hanging out  wigglies you're right it's too there's a great moment to an extras that i love so much it's like it's  such an honest way of capturing like any moment's an extra and uh and then he starts to hit uh he starts 
[02:12:00]  to hit big uh uh you know get his own sitcom yeah and in season two and you go to this little bar and  your fans are annoying you so then you go to this fancy place where they put you in the uh the special  vip area and they boot you out um when uh oh god who was it that showed up the singer oh my god  david bowie david bowie well um that's that um that happened to me um my uh my girlfriend was a 
[02:12:30]  producer on a big english soap um opera called eastenders you know and uh we went along with  some of those stars right when she was working we went there and they let us do in the vip just like  that they let us sit there and then they came over and said you're gonna have to move we said why i  said because goldie horn's just come in and they moved the these soap opera stars out of the way  for goldie horn to sit there what year was it 1979 who cares about her about 1992 she was over in  uh england i don't know what she was doing um but uh yeah so uh it actually happened but the david 
[02:13:00]  barry thing was sort of like that i mean obviously i couldn't be accepted where i wanted to be so i  went got i went back and got a little bit of um adoration and and from the from the idiots yeah  yeah but this at the end of the episode he goes back he ends up back in the bar but there's something  really touching about that it's like well these guys are really human these people it's like you  don't feel like they're caricatures there's something really touching about these guys 
[02:13:30]  because they're these these zeros that like want to be loved and and just well i think that's true  but i think if you scratch an actor or an actress um just a little bit you'll see you'll see  something bad that's happened to them and they really want a hug and they really need love and it's  just you know it's um not not all of them but um even the ones you think are all right you know  that they they can turn on a sixpence they can suddenly start shouting about their cappuccino being  cold and i'm always i'm always scared when i meet someone like are they going to be normal and you 
[02:14:00]  know um everyone i've met so far is has been pretty sort of like stable and i suppose that it's the  ones with talent that are okay it's uh it's these because you didn't talk to bobby that long huh  on the set i'm in his movie okay let's be serious i was actually you know what i'm still  thinking of sitting there with a hard hat on and he obviously isn't is he no can't a flesh-colored  one he was actually at the cellar with louis and i took a nice hot bombing i really wanted to do well 
[02:14:30]  in front of ricky you didn't bomb uh why did you think i heard both of you giggling when i wasn't  talking  there's a reason for that because um louis said to me he forgot to mention his therapist and i sort of  laughed because of louis pointing out where you'd gone wrong you were doing the thing where i've gone  wrong yeah i thought that was what i was laughing at i thought that i was laughing at the audacity of  louis during a set to lean over to me and go he forgot to mention his therapist where you're doing a 
[02:15:00]  bit about i think that and i that's what i laughed at we weren't like we weren't sitting there laughing  going look at the fat bald guy without a crack helmet on dying yeah uh look hey uh ricky we gotta  kind of cut it uh short and get out of here yeah we gotta go to the uh xm side and uh curse  thank you very much hold on ghost town is out it does come out today yeah but mention it  mention it every day for a week we need to stay around in cinemas we're only in about seven  we'll do that we have been talking we're your pal he was kidding jimmy no i know i realized that as

[02:20:00]  Yes.  We're still doing this.  Yep.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony show.  Serious XM satellite edition, which means we can now speak openly.  If someone's being a shithead, they can be called a shithead.  We don't have to say duty head.  That's a little too far, Bobby.  That's a little too far.  Fuck twat.  It's okay. 
[02:20:30]  Okay.  The C word, I like to say for maybe five minutes in.  Let the people that initially tune into the program think we actually might have a show instead of just we come on here and curse.  We've had a good show so far.  Yes.  It's all shit to me, though, from before this.  We had Michael Chiklis came in.  Ricky Gervais.  Great call in.  We love Ricky.  Yeah.  And Dane's calling in in a little while.  Fantastic.  But Michael Williams.  Yes.  Michael Williams joining us from the wire. 
[02:21:00]  I cannot be fucking happier.  Man, thank you.  Thank you for calling me down.  Omar.  I cannot be.  I've never wanted to get a guest in.  Maybe Ozzy Osbourne is the only comparable guest to me to get in.  You are a hard guy to get in studio.  It was just a lot of stuff that was going wrong, and we were trying for a long time.  Apparently, he was a busy guy, too.  Yeah, trying to pay them bills.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, he's in the new Spike Lee movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Miracle at St. Anna's, which I saw.  And there's another movie you're doing, too, right? 
[02:21:30]  I got The Road coming out, the new Cormac McCarthy book.  That'll be out on my birthday, actually, in November.  And then I got Brooklyn's Finest that Fuqua directed.  And I got to be opposite two of my mentors, Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes.  Don Cheadle's great.  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  I just saw his movie Trader the other day.  When you went to call me to go see that movie, I was in Trader.  There's a guy that climbed from just kind of a peripheral player to a fucking star,  you know?  The guy at Hotel Rwanda was like, wow. 
[02:22:00]  Man, I've been following Don since Devil in Blue Dress.  Really?  Yeah, he kind of popped on my radar.  His performance in Boogie Nights was great.  Amazing.  I mean, you know.  That whole movie was great.  Yeah, the whole movie was fantastic.  And he didn't have a huge part in it, but it was just like, when he's at that bank just  going, please, please, I just need that.  You're like, oh, God damn.  You're not being fair.  Yeah.  That's such a childlike thing to say to an adult. 
[02:22:30]  That's such a basic reaction.  You're not being fair.  It was great.  You're not being fair.  This is not fair.  This is not fair.  I could do this.  I want to open my electronic store.  His stereo store.  His electronic stereo store.  Him and his big dick in his fucking porn career.  You know what I mean?  And his cowboy outfit.  When the murder happened in the diner, the sheer look of fear in his face with his hands  up, like, and the blood splatter.  And he saw that cash lay in there.  What?  And his awful fake dreads that he had that fucking dread wig at the party.  My favorite moment, he's just sitting there with those shitty dreads trying to look intense. 
[02:23:00]  I believe that was on the New Year's Eve party, right?  Yes.  The dreads, yeah.  Oh, it's fantastic.  And then you see him in, like, Hotel Rwanda and stuff.  It's just fantastic.  You know, really.  I, like, totally.  I, like, I bugged out on him the first day of rehearsal because I, like, I went on this  whole tangent about Talk To Me and Petey Green's story that I was doing all.  I'm Petey Green.  Oh, the radio.  I haven't seen that.  I heard it was great.  Oh, God.  You got to see it.  It's off the fucking hook.  So I, like, kind of embarrassed myself the first day. 
[02:23:30]  That's good.  Like, when I walked in, I'm a fanboy, too.  Like, when I see somebody I like, I see him talking to Master Poe, and I'm like, is  Master Poe fucking hassling him coming in?  Nah, you got to respect the senseis, you know what I mean?  Master Poe.  Big up to my sensei back in Jersey.  Are you a martial artist?  I'm not a martial artist.  I'm getting my butt kicked in the dojo right now.  That's why I'm doing it.  Working on it.  I'm working on my Wesley Snipes.  I ain't nowhere near there, but, yeah.  I trained up there in Union.  How long have you been taking it?  About three months now.  Oh, you just started. 
[02:24:00]  Okay.  I'm sore as shit.  Oh, so, yeah, you're at that phase.  What are you taking?  Karate.  And it is the, see, I tell you, I'm really just, I'm really doing this.  It's karate.  You have an opaque belt?  No, no, I am no belt right now.  No belt?  They don't give you a belt?  Bro, I'm still trying to stretch to get my leg up.  Really?  Yeah.  I took karate once, and then I split my gi because I was too fat, so I quit.  Nah, man.  Don't quit.  Good for karate. 
[02:24:30]  You know how hard it is to split a gi?  I don't think it's ever been done before.  Never.  Oh, hey.  You're in the Guinness World Book now.  Twice.  Now, obviously, we come in here, you're a nice, soft-spoken guy and everything, but  now on the wire, how did you get that, where did that badass come from?  That ain't me.  That ain't me.  See, we have a rule on the wire.  If your phone goes off, it's $25.  If it goes off while we're filming, that's $50. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, really?  You got to get them.  You got to get them.  That's a pretty good one.  Hope you would owe a lot of money.  Yeah.  We bought a playground in Baltimore with the money we made from that.  We built a little basketball court for the kids in the hood.  But I just pretty much, I knew the character came written the way it was.  There was nothing much for me to add, so I knew I wanted to just make him sound like  a Baltimorean.  I didn't want him to sound like a kid from Brooklyn.  I knew I didn't want him to look like a kid from New York dressing like that.  I immediately saw that Baltimore got their own swagger. 
[02:25:30]  So I would spend hours in the street and just listen and watch the comings and the goings.  I got to watch, you know, girl go in in the morning and boy come out.  For those who don't know, that's crack and dope.  You know, crack goes in in the morning, dope comes out.  I swear to God, I thought it was some kind of a tranny reference.  Of course you did.  I swear to God.  You were hoping.  Boy and girl is coke and dope.  Really?  I would watch the streets.  I have a new way of saying it. 
[02:26:00]  I would watch the streets.  I would listen.  I would sit in the Lexington Market for hours and just listen to dialects and people's tones.  And, you know, with the help of David and Ed and the directors they brought, I just kind  of came together.  And I went to the shooting gallery, which is the roof of my old projects in Brooklyn.  Really?  Yeah.  I had to learn how to.  Because I didn't want to do the whole Hollywood thing with the gun.  Yeah, yeah.  I never really shot a gun before Omar, so I wanted to know what would it look like for 
[02:26:30]  a guy in my frame to hold a big-ass gun.  So I went to the shooting gallery in my hood with my building and I had to learn how to  bust a gun for a little bit.  You know what I mean?  Those are fun.  Yeah, it's fun.  Believe me, I'm an avid collector.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  So you must have loved the scene in season three when Omar and Brother Muzon had that little  gun conversation.  I'm not up to season three.  Yeah, I know.  I'm the last one to get into The Wire. 
[02:27:00]  But in this day and age, I like doing the 48-hour film festival where you sit there and  just keep putting DVDs in.  That's the way to do it, dude.  Oh, man.  No commercials.  Nothing.  You're sitting there.  Your eyes are red.  Drinking a beer.  What?  Just to-go containers everywhere.  One more.  And then you're like, just one more episode, man.  It's like, I'm definitely going to sleep after this one.  And then they end it in a way where it's like, well, fuck, now I got to watch it go.  At least the beginning of it.  And then before you know it, it's over.  You start out watching it, you're fully clothed, but you just have one sock half on. 
[02:27:30]  Half on.  Please.  Tipping off the tip to your toes.  I tell people who just now, when I meet people in the street, they're like, yo, I just bought  the whole five seasons and we're going to watch it.  I'm like, okay, you have to get some survival tactics.  You need water.  You need food.  You need something by the couch because you're a bucket to relieve yourself because you are  not moving.  So just understand that.  Donuts, water, and something to sit on and shit at the same time.  And that scene, by the way, in season three with Brother Muzon is a great scene because 
[02:28:00]  you shot him in a great moment where you call 911 for him after you shot him.  It's just, and they're discussing their weapons.  Just these two guys who are probably going to shoot each other discussing their weapons.  So great.  You would love that.  Fantastic.  It's such a, everyone I've turned on to the show fucking goes out of their mind for  the show.  They're like, why was this not higher publicized?  Cause the critics loved it, uh, but never nominated.  I've mentioned that many times, which is sickening house and all these fucking dumb shows that 
[02:28:30]  are nominated.  House.  House.  Oh, the doctor.  Once again, he's got to find out why a child is bleeding from the ass on an all new house.  All right.  We get it.  He handles weird cases.  So you were saying, uh, uh, you grew up in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Flatbush.  So now, all right.  I lived in Brooklyn for a while.  I kind of steered clear of Flatbush, but smart man.  Now, did you get out of there?  Uh, uh, obviously, you know, you're, you're an actor, you're doing very well. 
[02:29:00]  It seems like you would have gotten out of there kind of young or I just can't seem to  get out the hood for some reason.  No, I don't even know if I really want to get out the hood.  I kind of liked the hood.  Um, I'm in Newark right now where they got bodies dropping all around.  Hey, the garden spot of the garden state.  Yeah, man, I got the old four young girls got murdered around the corner from me.  So, so.  I was just watching a show called Jack last night, which is on, uh.  Jack, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's, uh, it's the squad that goes around, uh, Jersey and they were in Newark, uh, during 
[02:29:30]  the episodes I was watching.  And, uh, they just put in plate numbers of cars and just by luck, they find stolen cars  all the time.  People driving around and that's all they do all night.  Newark seems to be.  We're up the hook right now.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, they're just stealing cars like crazy over there.  Uh, cars, lives.  Yeah.  It's just insane.  Now, what, what's the attraction to being in that atmosphere when, you know, you're, you're  obviously doing very well.  I like you.  I like you. 
[02:30:00]  We gonna hang out.  But, um, I mean, you know what I'm saying?  So, um, it's affordable for number one.  And then my family's there.  You know, I still go back to my hood in Brooklyn.  I still have family out there.  And then, you know, we chill.  I go visit my aunts and, you know, my God kids.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My God kids.  He said, yeah.  Yeah.  No.  You got friends over there though that are kind of, it's still in my life or anything?  Or what kind of, yeah.  Like you mean alive?  No, it's still, like the old, yeah.  Like kind of.  Oh, hell yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Fucking around a little bit too much.  Yeah, you know, we've all been there.  But, um, you know, just, I got friends, I got people that just, that know Mike.  Yeah.  Before the Omar thing.  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of, I can understand that a little bit.  People kind of take, because people kind of take us for what we're worth here on the  show.  And it's a little odd when you meet people and it's like, no, I don't act like that all  the time.  I'm not, I'm not like that all the time.  I'm not drunk off my face all the time.  Yeah.  Well, no, that I am.  Yeah.  He means sober. 
[02:31:00]  I don't act like that all the time.  Yeah, there you go.  There was, uh, it's so hard.  I know as an artist you want to move on and you want to do like all these other projects  and you want to be, but it's like, I just want to fucking, I'm like a five-year-old.  I just want to fucking say Omar things.  All I want to do is say, what up, bird?  That's all I want to say.  Probably one of the best, for anyone that hasn't seen it, he's falsely testifying against  the guy to get him thrown away for a murder because the guy is a piece of shit.  I mean, bird's a piece of shit, but he wants bird and he and bird both know he's lying 
[02:31:30]  through his teeth and they say, do you see the defendant in court?  And he looks at the guy who he's lying about.  He goes, yo, what up, bird?  And he just wants to fucking cut your throat.  It's such a great moment.  What up, bird?  That was one of my favorites, by the way.  The court scene was definitely one of my favorites.  That's in season two.  But, um, like in the beginning, I remember people started coming to me like, yo, Omar's  a snake.  Was that season two or season one?  That's season two.  The courtroom scene was season two.  With bird?  Yeah, with bird.  When we're in the courtroom and he's testifying. 
[02:32:00]  I think that's season one.  Look at you arguing with the guy that was in it.  He's in it.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I love this dog.  He's in it, but I've watched it more.  I believe you, too.  He doesn't watch it and go, Omar.  He just goes, oh, it's me again.  Let me fast forward.  Fucking, uh, wasn't that, that was for the, oh, you know what?  He's probably right.  That was for the civilian murder.  Yeah, when the working man got birded, right.  The courtroom scene didn't happen until season two.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy.  Look, I'll stand corrected since the guy who did it. 
[02:32:30]  I really should have my fucking teeth kicked in.  Don't feel bad.  I made so much money last year on people betting whether that was Michael that killed Bodhi.  Oh, really?  I made so much money off of that side betting.  You know what?  You could win him a lot of money off of people asking what season of Lucky Louie it was.  I love, actually happened to love Lucky Louie.  It got a laugh from the people.  Oh, you know Lucky Louie?  Dude, I was, man, I got starstruck again.  He came to the premiere of, uh, Jesus.  Not you, him, Lucky Louie. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, I love Lucky Louie, bro.  Yeah, I know he means Louie.  I didn't miss an episode.  Did you recognize you when I came in from Lucky Louie?  You.  Ah!  Oh, my God!  Oh, shit!  What?  Holy shit!  Fucking neighbor!  I'm laughing, but this is pissing me off to no end.  Yo, you the neighbor, the crazy fucking neighbor!  I love you!  You and the fucking, um, the, the, the, the...  This is pissing me off!  This sucks!  The janitor's walking around naked all the time.  Oh, yeah, Rick Shapiro.  Come here.  Someone check, you got me cursing, man.  Dude, no.  That, you don't know how much this pisses me off. 
[02:33:30]  Because I hate when he really likes an actor, and they come in and know the motherfucker.  I hate it!  I love Lucky Louie.  Dude, I watch that shit every, every time.  I made the joke to goof on him, and it backfired.  I was, I was, uh, I'm thinner now than I was then.  That's probably why he didn't recognize me.  A man walks in in shape, it's kind of hard to see.  That face, you know.  What's his shape, all right?  That face, exactly.  Ask Sensei.  When you was coming down the hallway, I said, I know that face.  I swear to my God, I was telling Sensei that.  Damn.  Oh, in the hallway.  Yep.  Damn it! 
[02:34:00]  That makes me very happy.  I'm sure it does.  It makes me miserable.  It made me mad.  He took it off the air.  No, no, no.  I'm not going to cry, but another guy from The Wire who was actually a fan of Lucky Louie  was, uh, uh, uh, fucking Method Man.  I think me and Meth had some conversations about Lucky Louie.  Yeah.  We talked about that.  We talked about your show on the set.  I had, I had, we had lines from your show.  We'd bring it on, and we'd laugh.  There was something, you know, I smoked a lot of soy, soy pot.  I'm free, so it's a fry.  But there was a, there was, we had a few one-liners on that show that we would just, 
[02:34:30]  we started running them.  Man, I had skits from Lucky Louie.  Did you see what, that was what happened?  He was like this, this, and that.  Oh, that's makes me so fucking happy.  How'd you like his acting?  Was his acting good?  Man, that whole show was incredible, man.  That's, that's, that was real life comedy.  Very Honeymooners-ish.  Yeah, exactly, like, like, like, you know, the X-rated version of Honeymooners.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the R-rated.  And Louie never sweetened any of the laughs, because every comedy sweetens them.  They all, they all balance the laughs, and they put in these little laugh tracks to even  it out, and he never won, people would complain, some of the critics, that the laughs are too 
[02:35:00]  loud, because these little fucking pussies, they're used to these sitcom laughs that get  evened out.  Louie didn't do that.  No, you had real people in there laughing.  Yeah.  That's what you needed, that's what you needed in The Wire, a little laugh track.  Imagine that horrible, some horrible shit going down, and just, oh, an awful laugh track.  Like the old M.A.S.H. laugh, where there's that one guy trailing off.  They actually had a laugh track in M.A.S.H.?  Oh, boy, did they?  Yeah, it was awful.  I don't know why they did it.  They did an episode. 
[02:35:30]  Clinger probably had all the one-liners.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They, I think they did one episode without a laugh track, and people complained.  Well, as time went on, they removed it, because it just seemed.  The storyline, it was like, it just didn't go.  The storyline was getting darker.  It didn't make sense to have a laugh track.  Yeah, that's true.  It kind of, it was more of the anti-war thing going on.  And I just, I, that there's a laugh track in Hogan's Heroes.  You know, when you got a POW at Nazi POW camp.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's great. 
[02:36:00]  Look, here comes General Bull Carter.  Oh, he's going to come in, and more prisoners are coming in.  It's fantastic.  Swastikas on the wall.  Remember that shit?  I used to love that show.  I'd love to, I know.  I'd love to know who pitched that, though.  Because you know they're pitching it to Hollywood producers, probably Jewish guys.  Probably.  And they walk up, and it's like, I got a great idea.  It's a comedy based in a Nazi POW camp.  Go.  Green light it.  Green light's going to be huge. 
[02:36:30]  Well, they probably said, we won't do that.  It'll make money.  Okay.  No, okay.  Never forget that it's on Thursday nights at nine.  A rumor that he got, he got, you know.  Oh, yeah.  The head, head, Hogan.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, he was into some really kinky fucking group sex stuff, and videotaping it in the  early days of video.  Yeah.  He was videotaping stuff, and then there was a rumor that he had had sex with some guy's  wife.  Yep.  And then he bashed his head in.  He got his head bashed in with a tripod. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  With a fucking camera tripod.  Wham!  Bob.  Just caved his head in.  Bob Crane.  Bob Crane, yeah.  Yeah.  With his fucking, I hate to keep doing penis references.  He's a dirty boy.  But apparently Bob Crane was packing like ten.  You feel like that?  Yeah.  And yeah, he gave it to a lot of different girls, and some husband probably.  His son came in to promote something a few years ago.  Remember that?  They should release those films, because he videotaped himself just fucking Bob Crane fucking.  Just call it that.  Bob Crane fucking.  Yeah.  Fucking Bob Crane.  Fucking Bob Crane.  Bob fucking Crane. 
[02:37:30]  You get all three domain names, so no one's going to fucking steal it.  How many columns are you just here?  My kind of hero.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, his helmet looked like fucking Schultzes.  Hendrix, there's a fucking videotape of Hendrix.  Yeah.  A fucking network.  I almost went in a porn store and bought, I think Red Light District, who gets all that  stuff.  How long has that been out, though?  I don't know.  It's just odd that things have come out.  Like, it's very hard to keep anything secret anymore, especially things, films, pictures, 
[02:38:00]  things that have been buried in secrecy for years now with YouTube and stuff like that.  Yeah.  It's out there, you know?  See, I guess what I'm saying is, watch what you do on film, people.  How about just do nothing on film?  You know what?  The only thing I've ever done is set up a video camera with a TV and no videotape in there.  So you can kind of monitor what you're doing.  Yeah.  So there's no videotape.  You're just kind of looking.  And then you just feel silly.  Yeah.  You just look and go, what is that?  Oh, my God.  No, that's me from the back.  You feel safe.  You feel silly and safe. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because there's no record of it.  Yeah, exactly.  The first time I ever got a video camera, I actually recorded myself jerking off because  I wanted to see what it looked like.  Why would you do that?  And then I taped over a couple of my sets with it.  Why wouldn't you just burn the tape?  See, that's how it happened.  There was one second of me jerking off.  Yeah, of course.  I had a bunch of people over my house watching this tape.  And then there's just one second of the angle was from in between my legs.  So you saw my gray nuts and just me like this.  Oh, shit.  For one second, it was just like, what the fuck was that? 
[02:39:00]  It doesn't butt up against each other.  And then Wild Kingdom showed it first.  You showed them the coffee table, huh?  Yeah.  Would you have a gray sack?  Like a pig?  What?  I called it the coffee table.  The coffee table, there was an episode.  I watched this show on Showtime called Weeds.  So one time, the brother and the neighbor, the brother and the councilman was talking.  And they were discussing what is the part between the asshole and the nuts.  What do you call that, right? 
[02:39:30]  So they were like, yeah.  So the maid walks in.  They go, what do you call the space between the asshole and the nuts?  She goes to the coffee table, because that's where they were sitting in between.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's a funny fucking line.  Wow.  I called it the coffee table.  So you were showing your coffee table.  That's funny.  That is fucking beautiful.  What a great improv line that is.  Man, it's classic.  And we were talking, I mean, again, for Wire fans, we were talking, Mike and I were talking  off air, you know, as two men from HBO will do, just discuss things on air. 
[02:40:00]  Of course.  I was on HBO 2, Snoop, at the same time.  You were.  Doing what?  No, but you weren't talking about it with us.  Did you ever see Torgasm?  Dane Cook's Torgasm?  I was getting ready to say, you let the dude from Dane Cook's Torgasm.  I swear to God.  Holy shit.  I swear to God.  No hugs.  No, Bobby, he didn't want to hug you.  He didn't want to hug you.  He did it.  Okay, America, it's official.  We HBO family, we jerk each other off, man.  We watch each other's work, bro.  Anthony, go take a break. 
[02:40:30]  Look, I gave a bow during Jimmy's performance on HBO.  I stood up and went like this.  That is true.  I shot a special, and him and Opie, who's not here today because he's sick, came to,  and I acknowledged him in the audience, and Anthony stood up.  Yeah, right.  I did.  I'm on the radio.  The fuck do I know?  I'm not on HBO.  That's a real family vibe that we support the other show.  Like, you know, it's the first time we meet, but I've watched both you guys' shows.  Like, really.  That's hysterical.  I watched yours more than yours, but I don't think.  Pointing to Norton and then to Kelly's second. 
[02:41:00]  Make sure you clear that up.  Did you say something?  I did, too.  Hey, Michael, I want to talk about a Spike Lee movie you're in.  Yes, sir.  Yeah, how is that working with Spike?  Because some people say he's a breeze to work with, others, not so much.  Well, I'm on the breezy side.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You know, he just, he didn't, I didn't have to audition.  He wrote the character in, and he had me, you know, flew me in on his private lair, you  know, and had me land on top of the hotel.  Now, I'm just pushing.  Yeah, right.  But he did, he did write me in, and I did not, he did make me the offer for the character. 
[02:41:30]  He was, um.  Was that because of The Wire?  Yeah, The Wire.  The Wire, you know, and, um, you know, it's just, um, I had a great time working with him.  I don't, I think he caught me.  I was with him, like, three weeks out there in Tuscany.  I think he caught me, Michael, maybe, like, none.  He caught me Omar the entire time.  Oh, shit.  And whenever he saw me, whenever I was at, whether it be the restaurant, or when I first  got to work, when the set, anything.  Whenever he first saw me for that day, Omar coming, Omar coming, Omar coming. 
[02:42:00]  And it was, like, Spike, kill him.  He's awesome.  He's phenomenal.  He's real quick.  He has, he's, you know, he's direct.  He knows what he wants.  And, like, I like to call him the method director, because this dude is just really, he's really,  he's a genius with just creating scenarios, and these scenarios, and putting you in it  to live in it, even when you're not on the set.  Like, um, we went through boot camp.  You know, he put us up in this really high mountain where, like, your ears were popping 
[02:42:30]  in Tuscany, and, you know, you had, like, wow, stallions running around.  It was, you know, the boot camp was, was, like, like, really rough conditions, weather  wise.  But I had a, it was nowhere near as extreme as what those actual soldiers went through  when it was going down.  But we had, we got to get a taste of that.  We shot in the actual space where the massacre happened, which is the Surgical River in Tuscany.  So it was, like, a lot of history.  You could feel the eeriness.  Wait, was that, was that a true story?  I didn't know if it was a true story.  Oh, yeah, true story.  Okay, it was.  Well, I mean, I don't mean, not about the miracle with the whole head thing. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, but I mean, like, yeah.  But I'm talking about the war.  You know, I learned, I learned this just a second.  So if I sound smart, you know, it's by forcing it.  But, um, apparently, uh, the war, in World War II, when Hitler was trying to take over  the world, my pinky, having his pinky in a brain moment, um, he, he was next to go on  to Italy, and it's part of this region called Tuscany.  And, um, and this was the first time that, I believe, Patton, General Patton, he said,  yeah, get them niggas some guns. 
[02:43:30]  They want to fight, they want to fight.  And, um, he gave, you know, blacks first-time guns, but it was, like, minimal, uh, you know,  we had...  A bunch of muskets.  Yeah, yeah, the bare minimals.  And, um, we went out there, and in this river, we got massacred.  And, um, it was, um...  Wow.  And it was because, and they, they got massacred, and there was, uh, he was calling  in and saying, this is where we are, bomb the position, and, and the white, uh, commander  didn't believe that they had actually advanced across the river, and was bombing behind them  like a fucking dope and not, not hitting the enemy. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  So that's why they're stuck here, and they wind up in this little, uh, uh, Italian village.  And there's one guy, he taps into every fear a man has.  Who was the guy, uh, Bishop, uh, a guy with, with, uh, with, uh, a real slick dude who  just wanted to fuck the Italian women.  And the one guy's falling in love with the Italian girl, and, uh, oh, and then Bishop  just keeps going over, and he's pretty much talking about how black Americans have huge  dicks.  You know, he's trying to hint that to the little, dumb guinea broad.  And, uh, oh, there's a scene where...  Do you know your great, great, great, great grandpa? 
[02:44:30]  Oh, I love this guy!  And then, and Walken's so angry.  He licks his lips and he mouths, you can't get the gun faster than that.  Yeah, give the gun.  That was hysterical.  It was a true romance.  It was a fucking...  Spike Lee's actually very funny, too.  He's the kind of fucking...  He's got great comic timing when he's in his own films and he does funny shit, man.  I love Spike.  Man, he's a genius, you know.  Was he in the movie at all?  No, not in this one.  I haven't seen it in this one, yeah.  I don't think he's put his stuff in one of his own movies. 
[02:45:00]  Kind of takes you out of a period piece if you...  Since X, he hasn't been in one of his projects in one of his joints since X.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He should be.  He's always funny.  It's like a Hitchcock thing.  Maybe he got compared to Hitchcock too much.  He didn't like it because he would always...  I'm really talking quickly.  And he would always do...  I drank a lot of caffeine today.  Wow, you are going.  You're on...  What are you, boy or girl?  What is that?  That's a girl.  That's a girl.  Girls up, boys down.  I've made that mistake.  As we all are well aware. 
[02:45:30]  But we were talking...  You know what?  Hey, look.  Some of them sometimes...  It's fry high day.  What the hell?  Some of them are so passable.  You know, a lot of the Asians are too, but when you get to the Spanish, a lot of times...  Oh, forget about it.  Hi, poppy.  You've got to touch the Adams apple.  That's right.  And if they have one, you hand them the money.  Yeah, you mean?  Boop, boop, boop.  And for any...  You guys, we do have a studio audience here.  They're not mic today, which is...  Hi, guys.  Are you enjoying yourselves?  Thank God.  Shit, I almost went on TRL. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  Total retards live.  And it's funny.  I didn't realize that, Michael...  I don't realize when you're on a series, you watch it the same sometimes as the fans.  But there was a scene where a guy named Bodhi, who's up at the end of season four.  He became a huge character.  You're sure?  Season four?  Yeah, it was...  Yes.  Well, the fact is, I'm quite sure that Michael was right about season two, that scene.  And the fact...  Slow down.  That I debated him.  Yes.  Not only a show he was in, but a scene he did. 
[02:46:30]  Like, he wouldn't remember when he did it.  Man, but I love it, though.  It's just...  That's what we're here to do, you know what I mean?  But he said he was very sad when this guy got killed.  Like, I was surprised that...  Well, you can get ahead.  It's a satellite.  I didn't say sad.  I said I fucking cried.  You know, and I did.  First of all, big ups to J.D. Williams.  He's a phenomenal actor.  I've been watching his work since he was a baby on Oz.  And it's just to watch him. 
[02:47:00]  You know, he's on Broadway right now.  He's getting ready to do Broadway, the Roundabout Theater.  I'm just so proud of him, man, just to be in his presence.  But when they killed Bodie, I'm sitting there in Newark, house full of dudes.  And, you know, and we're sitting there.  And, like, I didn't, you know, I knew it was coming, but I didn't, man, just to see it.  And it's just so I had to turn my head.  I was like, gosh, it caught me.  You know that unexpected crowd?  You just didn't, you know, your eyes get real.  It's where you're sitting and everything's fine.  And then you go, oh, yeah, you know.  It's like, what did I just do? 
[02:47:30]  You have to blink quickly.  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.  Lest my friends think I'm a faggot.  Man, I couldn't even look at the screen no more, man.  And then what got me when Poot came and said, he grabbed him by the arm and said, Bodie, you don't got to do this.  Yeah, man.  And then he just pulled him off and said, ma'am, this is my corner.  And I'm a rock.  I'm a rock out with my cock out.  And it broke my heart.  You know what I mean?  I just, you know, I guess, you know, because you work on this show. 
[02:48:00]  You go to the office.  It's like four years I've been working with this dude.  And, you know, friendships kind of happen.  You know, we're down in these, form these bonds.  And I like the character.  I like the dude that plays the character.  And, you know, to see that happen, it kind of like, you know, well, he's not going to be at the office next week.  Right.  So you guys are seeing not only a character kill, but a guy who you like.  Who's not going to be there for the next season.  Yeah, that's the reality of it.  Same thing when they took Idris, when they took Stringer Bell.  That was a hard one.  That was a real hard day at the office.  And you're the one who did it. 
[02:48:30]  Hard day at the office?  You fucking popped like 16 bullets into him.  The two of you shot him together.  That was a great scene, too.  That wasn't that intense.  That dumbbell trying to get involved in real estate when deep down he's just a murderer.  And they fucking gave him a good killing.  Oh, boy, did they.  But you were happy to see him go.  After the way he fucking killed D'Angelo.  Oh, boy, he fucking had D'Angelo killed.  He was fucking his woman.  Oh, he was a terrible dude.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, he was a big, handsome dude, too.  Like, if you're in jail, that's the last guy you want to check up on your broad. 
[02:49:00]  No, yeah.  Oh, bruh.  6'5 and well-built.  I'll tell you, the female gender came at me with such hatred.  Really?  I didn't answer my phone for a while.  I'm talking like my mother caught me and cussed me out.  Like, Ma, I'm your son.  You killed fucking Stringer, baby.  Nah, but it was hard for a while.  That's pretty funny, though, when your mother gives you shit for stuff that you do like that.  Real talk, my mother does not even watch the wire.  Oh, okay.  She doesn't support it. 
[02:49:30]  My mother tells me all the time, she goes, I couldn't listen to you today, your show.  I don't listen.  I'm like, all right, well, you're kind of out of the demo.  You're like 70.  But, you know, maybe once in a while to see if I'm still employed.  You know, once in a while to check in on me, you know.  I think she still thinks, like, this is just me and my friends hanging out.  She's waiting for me to get a real job kind of a thing, you know.  Our mothers must be sisters.  Yeah, it's one of those things.  One of the things, right?  Well, you know, trade. 
[02:50:00]  A trade, you'll have it your whole life.  Get an education.  Something to fall back on.  I'm like, Ma, there is no plan B for me.  Mom, I'm sitting at my house.  Got some broads over here.  I'm drinking champagne.  You want to come over?  Don't worry.  But, yeah, come over.  We'll smoke a joint.  You know me.  She'll be there.  She's crazy, too.  Your mother?  Yeah.  She's a party animal.  I'm going to jump in this conversation, but my mom's right.  I should have been a hairdresser.  Why, Ma?  You've been doing great in your career. 
[02:50:30]  Really?  Yes.  You're in a movie with Ricky Gervais.  Yes.  The new Ghost Town movie.  Bob.  You're in that?  Well, no.  Let's phrase that carefully.  Yeah.  In the same way a tree or a car is in it, Bob is kind of behind.  He plays one of the bodies behind Ricky Gervais the whole time.  Yeah, Bob is in it.  Congratulations, but there doesn't think of small roles.  Only small actors.  Shakespeare.  He's not quite a small actor, but you're getting smaller.  You're getting smaller. 
[02:51:00]  I'll give you that.  I hate the fact that Bobby's losing weight.  This guy, oh, you should have seen him.  He was a disgusting, fat motherfucker.  Yeah, really.  That was just obese.  Wait a minute.  He fell into the category of obese.  Wait a minute.  He'd come in, and when he left, we'd just be like, how fucking fat is Bobby getting?  What?  You never told me this shit.  Yeah.  You made a couple fat jokes.  They were cute.  Yeah.  He's probably obese.  I never made a fat joke about you.  None of them were jokes.  They were sad observations. 
[02:51:30]  But now he's losing a lot of weight.  Tons.  And he looks good, and it's ruining our whole fucking thing with him.  You're fucking dieting yourself off the show, is what you're doing.  You're not going to be able to come on.  We'll be like, oh, Bobby Kelly's here.  What are we talking about?  Nothing.  Nothing.  At least you can breathe.  You know what inspired him?  Because when he was on Lucky Louie, you were a heavy boy. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, I put a lot of weight on craft services.  Tell me about it.  It's phenomenal.  He just eats fattening food.  When I saw his, he started losing weight, but he had his HBO special, and one of the photos,  they come and take photos, he was laughing at one point, and his neck was back, and he  had five layers of his neck, but there were five different colors.  It went from purple to black.  It looked like some exotic bird.  It looked like a pelican.  I was heavier, but I wasn't as bad as he, the photo that this was, no, it was bad. 
[02:52:30]  It looked like, you ever have roast beef, and it goes bad in a rainbow?  It sounded like it was that bad.  It was bad.  It was the color of bad roast beef.  Wait, can we get that picture?  It was a HBO half hour shot in 2005 or 2006.  Looks like someone should be throwing a fish on his nose.  All right, so it's not flattery.  It's not a good photo.  You look good now.  Thank you.  I look all right now.  I look better now.  But yeah, that's how you know I was bad.  I really was a chubby fucking Lucky Louie.  I see some of that footage, and I'm like, oh, you fucking pig. 
[02:53:00]  That was some of the shit that was classic, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  You watch Californication.  No.  Oh, no, Weeds.  You said Weeds, okay.  Yeah, Weeds.  Weeds is a good show.  What was some of the early stuff you did?  What was one of the first things you did as an actor?  The very first thing I did as an actor was a film with Tupac Shakur and Mickey Rock called Bullet.  That's not a bad first film.  I remember that.  I remember that movie.  That was my first thing ever.  Mickey's a crazy guy, too, right?  Mickey was, I spent like one day around Mickey because our scenes were different. 
[02:53:30]  But Pac, I got to hang around him a lot more.  But when I did meet Mickey, he seemed, you know, a little quiet.  He's laid back.  Yeah.  Just easygoing.  Do you look back on that, though, and go like, oh, what was I thinking?  Because we've done this to ourselves a lot.  We take our early works, and we bring it into the show, either play it on video or play it on audio,  and just cringe like, what the fuck was I thinking back then?  As far as my acting career, there was nothing.  That I would cringe at.  Now, I had another profession before I started acting, which was dancing. 
[02:54:00]  Okay.  That could be a cringe moment there.  Yeah, there's somewhere on God's green earth, there was footage of me in hammer pants and a belly shirt.  Hammer pants and a belly shirt?  Yeah.  What's a belly shirt?  It's a little head shirt, right?  Yeah.  It's every shirt you wear.  Girls call them tit-tops.  Girls call them tit-tops, but I can't go here, so it was a belly shirt.  Enjoy them.  I got some cringe moments as a dancer.  Wow.  I mean, if my mentor, Tupac Shakur, could be on a stage with Digital Underground with some Speedos on, 
[02:54:30]  humping a fucking blow-up doll, I could be in some hammer pants and a belly shirt.  Wait, was he in that video?  That was live footage.  If you watched the Thug Angel, there was some footage when his first gig was the roadie.  He got a roadie.  He was a roadie for Digital Underground.  Oh, wow.  And then he bumped up to, like, background dancer, like, it's got to be part of the stage show,  and they would get in these, like, really colorful Speedos-type thing underwear and hump on blow-up dolls on the stage. 
[02:55:00]  So when I saw that, I was like, you know what?  We all got a pass, and we all come from somewhere, damn it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're back on the road.  You ain't born as sexy as you is.  You got to get morphed into that.  Work on it.  Yeah.  Damn, that's rough.  That's a rough one.  Hey.  Footage out there somewhere, though.  Man, listen, I wouldn't trade a thing.  Nah.  When did you find out, because I was shocked. 
[02:55:30]  That's not it.  When, if you Google Jim Norton and then just look up images, I think you'll find, it's one of the first images.  It's a fucking disgrace.  When did you find out that they were going to, spoiler alert, wait.  No, no, go down, go down.  That's me from Lucky Louie.  Go down.  No, it's none of those.  Go down, go down, go down.  It's his book cover.  Nah, none of those.  You got a book, dude?  Go to the name.  Oh, yeah, he wrote a book.  Yeah, it's all about my experience with prostitutes and stuff like that.  Oh, man.  It's true.  I'll give you a copy.  It's a copy. 
[02:56:00]  I should have been in some of those.  It's called Happy Endings.  Oh, do you love the hookers?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little weed, some hookers.  I'd love to pull a train with him.  I'll fucking pay for the chick.  You take whatever end you want.  I fucking would love that.  You're a pisser.  Most people are just like, hey, you doing anything?  I think for lunch, when you first meet somebody, hey, a cup of coffee.  You're like, hey, pull a train with a hooker. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, let's grab a chick and fucking, let's high five over her back.  Yeah, put her on the rotisserie.  Pass the blunt.  You know what I mean?  Is that it?  Is that it right there?  The picture?  Oh, you kind of look a little mopey in that one.  What's that?  Black and white one from your old days?  In that last picture, the one with the blue hoodie on, you look like a dude from Extras.  Oh, go back a second.  Oh, that's, but that's, I did, that was 2003, and that was just kind of an image shot.  That was your, you having a dove moment, dude.  That was the before picture.  That's the dove commercial, you having a dove moment.  A woman thought, this photographer wanted to photograph me, so I took these photos, 
[02:57:00]  because she thought I would actually be handsome with holding flowers, which was bizarre.  I know I'm not a good photograph subject.  Man, beauty's in the eye of the beholder.  Thank you.  There's me and 50.  You know, you passed through them.  Where Curtis at?  Go back one.  You in 50?  Go back two.  Yeah, I have a great shot with 50, actually.  Go back two, please.  Top left.  I know this is radio.  Top left.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  You know something?  He has this thing with, no matter who you are or what you are, when you get in a picture 
[02:57:30]  with 50, you point at the camera, like, what is that?  Yeah.  It's like, you feel like you have to do that.  That's a camera.  You know, it's like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Everybody is like, it's something when you, you know, it's like, I never saw people do  that before he started doing it, like, you know, pointing at the camera.  That's a camera.  That's a camera.  And that's a photographer behind the camera.  You just do it.  I don't know why my hand went up.  It's a 50 thing.  I'm telling you.  He's been shot.  At least he has a reason to be kind of gangster.  I put my hand up, like, eh, two peas in a pod. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, I flew to Cancun with him.  We were doing MTV stuff totally separate.  It was coincidental that we were sitting together.  All right.  Glad you cleared that up.  Well, I didn't want him to think that I was trying to imply that, you know, yes, you  know, Fiddy and I do gigs.  And I tried talking to him and I just ran out of steam after like a minute and a half.  It was fucking humiliating.  Four hours of silence.  I found it.  Yeah.  You look like a middle-aged woman.  Oh, God damn.  Yeah.  Okay.  You should be just selling stuff on eBay in Albany, New York.  That's not the most flattering. 
[02:58:30]  Shopping network.  Look at that neck.  Look at those lips.  All right.  The smile is not good.  It's a jovial moment.  I really am.  But you were in character.  You know, it wasn't like you were posing for the camera.  You should be pulling your head off saying, two weeks.  Two weeks.  And have Arnold under.  Yeah, that's not a get ready for a surprise.  Listen, let's remember, I got a belly shut on somewhere.  And hammer pants.  And hammer pants.  It don't get no worse than that.  But I had hammer pants on, too, in my first head shot because I started comedy in 1990. 
[02:59:00]  Should I have a hammer over your head?  I believe it.  And it would bounce right off.  The claw end fucking buried in my coffee table.  There's a photo of me with hammer pants.  I used to wear those workout pants.  I didn't wear the belly shirt.  But I thought that was like a really cool hip look from 1991.  Yeah, remember that?  I mean, it was hammer.  It was hammer time.  For a time, it was for like 10 minutes.  I actually bought a pair.  There was a window.  At Pier 1 Imports.  I bought.  They weren't real hammer pants.  No, they were sails for a ship. 
[02:59:30]  You know what?  I really wish I was fat again right now.  I know.  Because you're on fire today.  I can't.  These are just great ones.  It just annoys me.  Dude, you can't do that.  But I got liquid in my mouth.  Fucking hilarious.  Because as soon as you say that, we're all thinking of a fabric big.  Fabric big.  Smart asses.  Wow.  That was a fucking gem. 
[03:00:00]  That was a fucking gem.  You say, you know, working with Tupac, does it surprise you or upset you or anything that  nothing's been really solved in his murder?  It's a little upsetting.  Not too much surprising.  Yeah.  It is a little upsetting.  I mean, no one's talked.  Disappointing by that.  No one's talked.  I mean, everybody has their theories and maybe more than theories as to what happened.  Do you have, and I'm not even saying to say what it is, but do you have your theories 
[03:00:30]  of what happened?  Yeah, I do.  So, Tupac Chacol was murdered.  All right.  You know, I'm going to go along with you on that one.  There you go.  I know that for sure.  All right.  Now the big one.  Who do you think did it?  I got the answer for that one, too.  Yeah.  I am absolutely positively, I mean, I know for a fact it was not me.  All right.  All right.  It was, that'll never be solved. 
[03:01:00]  He said mob hits.  I mean, guys that are just gangsters, no one's going to fucking rat anybody else out.  I mean, within like a week of Tupac, of them killing him, like a string of murders  happened.  Yeah, yeah.  The dude that he was fighting with in the Vegas club got murdered.  His brother in Jersey got murdered.  It's just like, it's just, you know.  It's just such an odd thing, a crossover between entertainment and the mob.  Because it's pretty much, it's mafia tactics.  It's, you know, it's fucking old Cosa Nostra stuff mixed in with popular music. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  So a lot of people.  It might be mafia tactics, but I don't know if it was the mob, per se.  Well, no, not the mob mob.  I'm talking, you know.  Not the Italian mafia, but just the thing of real life and entertainment that really are.  Oh, and it's like fucking Sinatra shooting Dean Martin.  When we shot that car, they knew what they was doing.  And, you know, with the whole center mask thing, you know, just the day, you know, it was,  it wasn't, they were just popping off with the hand twist like this.  Right, right.  Yeah.  The hand twist to date, they were very serious.  Turn your sights up, gentlemen. 
[03:02:00]  Please, could you just turn your sights up?  I think you'd save a lot of kids that way.  You just.  What do you mean by turn your sights up?  Turn the sights up.  That's sideways shit.  Is this for the movies?  It might look cool in the movies, but.  It really doesn't.  It looks so old school now.  It looks real old school.  It's so 80s.  Yeah, it is 80s.  Buck, buck.  Yeah.  Who just did it?  You're going to shoot yourself in the foot.  You know what I mean?  The King of New York, there was a fucking, I think when Fishburne got shot, I think the  cop who shot, was Wesley Snipes, wait, no, no, no, David Caruso shot, but I think Caruso 
[03:02:30]  at one point points his name as a cop and fucking points sideways.  It was an 80s thing, 80s, 90s.  I did out at the range one day just to see what it's like.  And you can't hit shit.  And you mess around.  And you know, we thin guys, man.  You mess around and get that kickback, one of them guns, man.  You hurt your wrists.  Yeah, that's not the way you're supposed to do it.  That is not the way it's supposed to go down.  We have, just so you know, too, Dane Cook is calling in one minute.  You'll hang, right?  Oh, okay.  Absolutely.  Okay, cool.  Hang out.  We got to play my new record.  Yeah, we definitely will.  Yeah, that's right.  What do you got going on? 
[03:03:00]  Man, you know, I just decided to put all my own wax.  One day during first season, I got a phone call from the late, great Jam Master J.  And he was commending me on the phone.  And I almost crashed because I was driving.  But he commended me on the phone that he loved the work.  And he had this concept of putting all my own wax.  And, you know, I've been working on that for the past five, six years.  You know, I'm not a rapper.  So I had to first learn how to rap.  I'm like, sure, I can do it.  How the fuck do you rap?  So, you know, I had to go find that out. 
[03:03:30]  And I've been working on it for the past four or five years.  He, unfortunately, the day that I was bringing the first thing for his ears,  since he had spoken to me over the phone, that's the day he got murdered.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, so he never got to hear this in the physical.  But I know he's somewhere above shining on my little effort.  But so this track here, I'm not a rapper.  This is not Michael Kenneth Williams.  I do not want to be a rapper.  This is Omar on wax.  Omar don't even rap.  He just keeps throwing over the beat. 
[03:04:00]  And I got a real, real powerful track opposite Mary J. Blige.  We call it the Mary O remix.  And, yeah, that's what we're working with right now.  Omar Cummins, the name of the record.  The name of the album, actually.  We'll hang out and we'll play that after we get Dane.  We will definitely play that.  Dane on the phone.  What, we got like a minute or something?  And Dane will be on?  Yeah, supposedly.  I think we were supposed to have him right now.  What's the matter, Bobby?  You don't know where he is right now?  Why don't you call him, huh?  Yeah, why don't you call him in your red highlighted first guy on your fucking iPhone list. 
[03:04:30]  Second guy.  Dane, we need you, Dane.  Norton's first.  Oh, he is?  Yes.  I put Norton first and then I put you second.  No, you didn't.  You're right.  You're not even in my phone.  I deleted you off of Xbox.  I got to pee real quick.  I'll be right back.  All right, Jimmy.  I got to tinkle.  Do we have time to take a quick break then if we do that and then wait for Dane?  Let's do one.  All right.  We'll take a quick break.  Jimmy, go wee-wee.  All right.  And when we come back, we'll talk to Dane and Michael still hanging out. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Please.  What are you fucking raising your hand?  Take a piss.  What am I?  You're dead.  Out of here.  Just don't touch each other's weenies.  Bathroom break balls.  Shaking it off, boss.  He's actually, we got them right now.  I'm about to tell him to fucking wait.  Guys, we're taking a piss.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll be right back.  Okay.  Every knee must bend.  Every head must bow.  Every tongue must confess.  Thou art the greatest.  The greatest of all time.  Ella.  Ella.  A.  A.  Yeah, we suck. 
[03:05:30]  Opie and Anthony, y'all.  When you walk through the garden, kind of watch your back.  Mmm.  Well, I beg your pardon.  Andrew, we're back on the radio.  Yeah.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony show.  These people bothering Michael for a picture.  Why would you do that to a celebrity guest?  I'm kidding.  Jimmy's the worst.  I'm the worst.  And I'm officially a family member of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:06:00]  I have my T-shirt.  I'm official.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Got the T-shirt.  Been taking pictures with the audience.  We've brought them in.  Yes.  Yeah.  Like we usually do on Friday and then regret it.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Patty's here, of course.  He calls you audience while you're here, but I wouldn't tell you the things he was calling you guys.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, they know.  They hear it on the phones.  They hear it in live appearances.  They know what they are.  Usually, it's just the bleacher scum.  Today, you have the audience.  I'm kidding.  Hi, Patty.  By the way, she's a 50. 
[03:06:30]  How old are you now?  53.  53-year-old virgin.  She's never.  What's up, Patty?  Yeah.  That's stalker Patty.  Hi.  How you doing?  She's never been with a man.  And, well, you know, I'd love to talk to you about it again, but actually, I wouldn't.  We have.  I lead a good, honest, clean life.  Oh, shut up.  We got Dane on the phone.  Jesus Christ.  Let's go to Dane Cook, who's been waiting patiently on the phone.  Dane?  Gentlemen.  Hey, man. 
[03:07:00]  Dane, congrats for being in Bob Kelly's new movie.  Ah, look at him.  He's got a good laugh there.  No, I was in Ghost Town.  Ooh.  Ah, because I'm not in yours.  We had to cut Bobby out.  Bobby will be a featured DVD extra.  Oh, God.  What happened?  He just didn't bring it.  All right.  At least you're honest.  That's not what you told me.  He didn't bring it. 
[03:07:30]  Bobby just didn't bring the high caliber ha-ha that he usually does.  He was lackluster on that day.  You know what?  Can I just say something?  I think he's being really truthful.  I think he is.  There's not one fucking scene.  And hurtful.  Yeah.  And Bobby will try to.  Bobby's scene was hilarious, but, you know, that's the whole thing with these damn movies.  You know, you do it, and your favorite stuff always ends up, you know.  But that was telling right there.  Bobby's scene was hilarious.  It's like one scene.  Hey, look.  It's one scene more than I had on a cutting room floor. 
[03:08:00]  I know.  You chatty cappy on any fucking talk show you're on.  Don't feel bad, because I went around bragging to everybody.  I think I told the world that I was in the new Incredible Hulk movie, and I ended up on the editing room floor.  Oh, no.  I made it to the deleted scenes, I found out, so I guess Ed Norton thought about me the way Dane feels about me.  I was lackluster that day.  You didn't bring it.  I didn't bring it.  Well, Dane, Jesus Christ, you're pumping out a few movies?  Yes, indeed.  One of the funny ones, actually. 
[03:08:30]  When does Satan have to come back and take the assault?  This is it.  Is this it?  The last one?  This is the last one.  And then, yeah, part of the Satan deal is I would be relegated to, like, off-off cable.  Do you have two movies out?  Uh, no.  All right.  It's just one.  Okay.  I just see them on all the time.  You're on my television constantly.  I know.  I'm sorry.  And off.  Don't be sorry.  You bring laughter to my life. 
[03:09:00]  That's Michael K. Williams.  And the fact that he's, like, a fan of yours, it's kind of hurting my heart, because he likes you more than he likes me.  Well, he's good looking, man.  He really is a handsome dude.  Damn.  He doesn't have the chin, the neck, the neck.  Multi-colored pelican neck.  It doesn't look like he gets something to get at the bottom of the ocean.  A little light on it.  Hovering around the Titanic.  So what is this movie now that you're in now, this week? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, I mean, the thing about this, you know, I've done a few movies up until now that I think, you know, there's been some nice highlight moments.  You know, I've made some comedies that I think have highlight moments, but this is the first one that my company actually produced.  And so, I really, I get to get my stink in there.  I get to get my comedy, my comedy urine is all over this, this movie.  Urine?  You know, I'm sorry.  You've marked it.  I get to do a movie that really kind of took the essence of my comedy and put it in there in a fashion that was much more presentable. 
[03:10:00]  Instead of just being a leading man, hey, I'm in the middle of the movie and Andy Dick's over here being a nutbag.  Yeah.  It was like, let me get in there and actually do my funny, my way.  So this is one that's kind of like, this is one that you're happy with as far as like from beginning to end, you're like, this is the way I want it to come out.  Yeah, like with my other movies, you know, I watch it and there's like, you know, scenes where I like, you know, would leave the theater and, you know, come back. 
[03:10:30]  But this one, you know, I watched it with the crowd the other night in the premiere.  And I was just, you know, stoked because I knew, okay, great, when this scene comes around, let's see if that worked.  Let's see if that gets the big yucks.  It's got to be a lot of pressure.  And I get to play like a villain.  You know, this is like the bad, this is like playing Darth Vader, but he uses his powers for good because Tank Turner is a hired gun.  The guy you bring in, let's say you cheat on your girl, you do some dastardly deed. 
[03:11:00]  You can hire me to come in, date your ex, get to know her, drive her absolutely bad ass crazy.  You can say shit.  You can be this maniacal douchebag to her so that she comes back to you.  Oh, okay.  That's kind of interesting.  Yeah.  Dan, can I ask you a question?  All that, and I got that's kind of interesting.  No, no, because it had to sink in for a minute.  It was sinking in like I was getting a grasp on the whole thing going, you know, I was thinking it through.  Like with that.  No, no, no, I'm going to use that in the marketing campaign. 
[03:11:30]  I see the commercial now, Opie and Anthony say, cut.  Kind of interesting.  Hey, thanks for blowing up my spot.  Yeah, I'm a dick, okay.  You're right.  I'm trying to get persnickety here, but.  That sucks.  I'm kind of interesting.  I'm a tool.  Michael wants to ask you a question.  But do you, do you, these, the films that you're in, are you, you write them?  You write those stories?  Or do you write, like, I know you, I know you write your, your comedy.  Do you write your lines or do you write, have you written a script?  Like how much in the writing are you involved with?  Yeah, this is the first film that, this guy, Jordan Cahan, who I've known for a bit, I wrote 
[03:12:00]  it with him, I mean, he wrote it and then I came in and, you know, we adjusted it for  my comedy.  Other movies I did, I came in after.  It was like, okay, it's greenlit and it's going and there wasn't much maneuvering.  But with this, it was like all the way down to location scouts and, you know, getting  it filmed back in Boston and casting.  So this is the most authentic, you know, film version of what I do in my, my standup. 
[03:12:30]  Dan, Bob Kelly.  You look great, by the way.  Thanks, man.  Doesn't he?  The Asian tapeworm worked.  That's a line from Big Fat Girls.  What's her name?  Anyway, that was an Asian tapeworm thing.  She was trying to lose weight.  Come on, the actress.  Fat actress.  Oh, the chick from Kirstie Alley?  Kirstie Alley.  That was a she was trying to lose weight.  Anyway.  Jim, Jim.  Nice one. 
[03:13:00]  Is Bobby asking me a question?  Yes, I believe he is.  Bob's got his interview voice going on.  Well, Dane.  What do you got, Bob?  Yeah.  Well, first of all, big fan.  And second of all, thank you for all the money you've given me.  And third of all.  She's listening to this ass lapping.  Third of all.  How funny, how funny really is Alec Baldwin in this movie?  Because he's, everything he does, I love when he does comedy.  But I mean, how funny is he in this movie?  I got to tell you, he's, he's, he's kind of interesting. 
[03:13:30]  Dude, Alec Baldwin.  Here's the thing about Alec Baldwin.  You know, you know how funny he is.  It's just like 30 Rock and, you know, how intense he is from, you know, Glenn, Gary, Glenn Ross.  But you can tell, the guy's like, he's a, he's a titan.  I mean, he should be carrying a, a frigging lightning bolt in his hand.  He's unbelievably, just his presence is, I say about Alec, it's like if, you know, if there was a bull in a china shop and Alec Baldwin walked in, the bull would sit there and patiently wait for Alec to leave.  He's just such a, he's just such a, he's kind of scary. 
[03:14:00]  And there was a day on set, you know, I always have what I call like, you know, my A-lister ball bust moment.  And I did it with Costner and I did it, you know, every movie I've done, there's that.  Kevin?  About two weeks in where I'm like, okay, I'm going to, I feel comfortable enough for this person.  I'm going to bust their balls.  And with Alec, we were shooting a scene one day and he was really pissed off because he couldn't get this little monologue down the way he wanted to.  And it just wasn't coming out.  And so I'm standing there with him and the director and writer and he's really going on. 
[03:14:30]  And he's just like, I just don't, I don't feel like this works.  This is something that we need to rethink.  And he's going on and on.  And I finally just said, listen, Alec, sincerely, this is what I'd like you to try.  Forget the monologue, just say Beetlejuice three times in a row.  Oh.  And he just, his eyes become razors and he stares at me for about three seconds and then he just went, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.  Which is awesome.  Yeah, there was something about, I was just watching The Departed last night again and he's great in that one too. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, no, the guy, he's a tremendous actor and I couldn't believe we got him.  And then he just came with the funny and he'd rewritten scenes and he was improvising.  You know, again, the DVD stuff is like always a lot more fun even because you get to see two people just kind of going toe-to-toe.  So it's a funny flick and he's great in it.  Dane's publicist is saying he's got one minute left.  I guess they got a phone thing.  Oh, those are so much fun.  Dane, this movie, this isn't like a romantic comedy because some of the trailers are like, it looks like Kate Hudson's out to meet the guy of her dreams or some shit. 
[03:15:30]  But this is a pretty edgy flick, right?  Yeah, you know the movie company.  They have to try to, you know, pull in as many asses and seats.  They're trying to get more vaginas in the seats, I think, with that.  The movie poster looked a little kind of chick flicky.  Yeah, no, I had a little fun, you know, roasting the poster there about a month back because I couldn't stand for it. 
[03:16:00]  I was like, okay, first of all, if you look at the poster, I or no man on earth who has any balls at all would crane their neck that far.  What's the poster?  Can we see the poster?  Over my shoulder that far like an owl at a woman, shoot me in the chest.  We've talked about this before where when I used to go into Blockbuster and stuff, I would get douche chills just looking at some of the video covers.  There was somewhere the actor would be looking at the female lead and giving that, oh, now you. 
[03:16:30]  And she's got her arms crossed looking over her shoulder like, well, you too.  Yeah, don't you think of it, mister.  And I'd look and go, there's no way I'm ever going to see this movie just based on that.  See, and you're looking over each other's shoulders.  Look at your face.  Holy fucking Photoshop.  Those aren't even my lips.  No.  Yeah, those are like Angelica Houston's lips from like 82. 
[03:17:00]  And the guy's standing there kind of watching this whole thing go down like, oh, let's hope.  Yeah, and you've got like the scruffy beard thing going.  Wow.  Honestly, I never even posed for that picture.  And it's just, it's so weird.  So I had to, you know, it's the comic side of us that you just want to, you can't let those things go.  So I just told Lionsgate, listen, I'm going to bash the poster because it stinks.  Yeah, you ought to just go around and every time you see one, draw a big cock into Kate Hudson's mouth. 
[03:17:30]  Yes.  Like just, well, I don't know, you take a sharpie and just do it.  Nothing personal, just it would make the poster funny.  Nothing makes a poster funnier than a real archaic drawing of a cock in someone's mouth.  We all laugh at it.  We certainly do, endlessly.  All right, your publicist has given a shit, Dane.  The movie comes out today, right?  Movie opens today, yeah.  All right, well, it's called My Best Friend's Girl. 
[03:18:00]  It was obviously with Dane and Kate Hudson.  Bobby Kelly's coattail, Dane Cook.  Do you see me at Dane Cook?  What?  You are.  You're opies.  What?  Can you see me at all in the movie?  Like even like a cheek?  That sounds sad.  Oh, that's sad.  Wow.  All right, man, well, take care, Dane.  Yeah.  Good luck, brother.  Bobby, I should tell you right now, Bobby, you're actually, your scenes are still there,  but we just, we actually overlapped Orny Adams' voice. 
[03:18:30]  A lot of people don't know who Orny is.  He was like the comedian that got painted as a dick who was behaving like a dick in the  Seinfeld documentary.  Yeah, and this is the most press that he'll ever get is us talking about him right now.  Yeah.  Me and Dane saw him on Runyon Canyon and he didn't say hi to Dane.  Why?  And he said hi to me.  Yeah.  Why?  Because he's a fucking dick.  He goes, oh, I'll say hi to you.  And Dane was like, ugh.  He goes, yeah, I'll stop and say hi to you.  And then he shook my hand and then he goes to shake Dane's hand and Dane was like, what? 
[03:19:00]  He gave him the, he goes, what, you won't shake my hand?  He goes, you just told me you didn't want to fucking shake my hand, you psychopath.  Oh, he's nuts.  He's an odd guy.  That's why I like him now.  Dane Cook.  My best friend's girl.  This weekend, number one movie.  Tonight?  Yeah.  Tonight.  Yes, tonight.  Theater hopping later, checking people out and seeing if people, and also I have a tradition  that I always, on opening night, sneak into a theater and I masturbate next to a stranger  to my own movie. 
[03:19:30]  That was you?  Holy shit.  I nudge them as I'm wearing my hoodie and I peek out so that they tell their friends,  I'm telling you, man, it was him.  He was jerking off right there.  I thought my popcorn was salty.  I do the same thing in your movies.  Every time you come on screen, I'll just go, I know him.  All right, Dane, thanks a lot, man.  Good luck with the movie.  It's kind of interesting.  All right.  Enjoy it, man.  All right, man.  Later.  See you, bro. 
[03:20:00]  I didn't mean kind of interesting in a bad way.  I was processing that whole scenario in my head.  And I'm like, yeah, that's good.  Yeah, that's like interesting, you know?  All right.  Like you always kind of think of a scenario that you could put yourself in and if that  would work and stuff.  So I'm like, oh, it's kind of interesting.  That's all.  That's all.  Oh, Jesus.  Bob Kelly takes a whole banana in his mouth in one.  Dude.  Dude.  A fucking rookie cannot do that. 
[03:20:30]  You're a pro.  I don't really watch this.  He can take a stalk of bananas in his mouth.  Ah, you gagging fucking lightweight.  Oh, and I'd love to see you in slap happy.  Exactly.  Too many Asian dicks, Bob.  Fucking bukkake, your eyes all red.  Red, dry, jismed eyes.  That's what I want to see.  Big fucking red eyes on you.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, we always got to acknowledge the audience, especially on a Friday. 
[03:21:00]  There's so many people that come in on a Friday.  Where are you guys on, like, Monday through Thursday?  Working or something?  We're from Canada.  We keep them all the way down from...  Fucking Canadians.  Someone has good taste in reading material.  What do you got?  Oh, Jimmy's book.  What a good man.  Thank you, Jimmy.  How many loonies did that cost you?  Or toonies?  They're stupid money.  Six months ago, it was cheaper than in the States, but now the dollar's gone.  Yeah, the dollar's kind of coming back, isn't it?  Oh, is it really?  You had your day in the sun for a couple of months there. 
[03:21:30]  Hey, our dollar's more than yours, eh?  I'm so glad we could throw your quarters away again.  That's it.  I hope a moose eats your book.  Fucking stupid tin quarters.  Yeah, what is that?  What do you got?  A loonie, a toonie, and a five?  You don't even have, like, a dollar bill?  No, it's gone.  Yeah, what the fuck?  You gotta carry change in your pocket.  It's terrible.  That's stupid.  Canadians jingling, jangling all over the place.  Yeah, it probably cuts down on burglars.  Get rid of the penny, though.  The penny is going away. 
[03:22:00]  The what?  The penny.  We're getting rid of the penny.  Good.  What'd you say, Jim?  Good for you.  I said that fucking in Canada, there's probably a...  Oh, let me explain.  Oh, he thought my joke bombed.  No.  No.  Nobody heard it.  Let me say it.  I was saying that because...  Let me see if I can get this out without laughing.  Because it's all change, I was saying there's probably not a lot of burglaries because you'd  hear the guy jingling, we heard you, Jim. 
[03:22:30]  Canadian burglars, linger longer.  Canadian burglars, linger longer.  Yeah, well.  Wow, so Canada, what part of Canada, sir?  Halifax, Nova Scotia.  Wow, Halifax?  Holy shit.  I know someone from Halifax.  I want to say the chick's ass from Moose Jaw.  Yeah.  That's the opposite end of the country, Bob.  Oh, sorry.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:23:00]  Literally, right?  Did you really?  What do you do in Halifax?  It's a really white ass.  What do I do?  Yeah, what do you do?  I'm in Lumber Billing Supplies Wholesale Distribution.  Of course, has something to do with...  Goodfellow.  Of course, has something to do with fucking wood.  Something wood or fucking antlers.  Something to do with...  So you're, yeah.  Yeah.  So how far, let me ask you, how far, not to completely ignore you, when did you find  out?  Sorry, I'm addressing Michael.  I want to hear a song.  Please.  We're going to hear a song.  Yes. 
[03:23:30]  I'm excited.  But I have a selfish question I want to ask.  All right, go ahead.  When did you...  I hate to spoil this for people, but if you haven't seen it, you haven't seen it.  When did you find out that your character was going to get popped?  In The Wire?  Yeah.  About a...  I didn't...  Well, I always knew when I got hired, they told me Omar was going to die.  I just didn't know when.  I knew.  But when it actually was coming, I got the script about a week before.  About a couple days.  Maybe a little less than a week.  Just scratch out the part where you get killed and rewrite something.  Hey, I had an idea.  Omar gets elected congressman. 
[03:24:00]  No one will believe that.  One thing I never do is scratch out anything that David Simon writes on paper.  Very diplomatic.  Yeah, just leave it alone.  That was my worst TV moment.  My worst, worst TV moment ever.  I couldn't...  I was fucking...  Mine was tourgasm.  I love you, Bobby.  I love you.  You know I do.  I love you.  It was a good one.  It just hit me right out of the blue.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  It's alright.  It was fucking... 
[03:24:30]  I just sat there with my mouth open.  Fucking...  Again?  In shock.  Anthony's on fire.  He really is.  I gotta shut up.  I'm sorry.  But we're giving him...  I'm giving him the biggest setups.  And so I said, point to an asshole.  Fucking...  It really was.  I mean, I just...  I fucking sat there and just...  I couldn't fucking believe it had just happened.  I couldn't believe it had just happened the way it happened.  It was so unexpected and so non-climactic in the sense that you didn't... 
[03:25:00]  It didn't get to where you wanted it to go.  And that's what he said he was gonna do.  That's being so into a show and into a character when something like that happens and actually  affects you like that.  Yeah, but he said on purpose he was gonna hurt people.  Yeah, that too.  And that was the shot heard around the world.  I don't think I've heard that much controversy over a TV character being shot since J.R.  Yeah.  Why, though? 
[03:25:30]  Because what I don't get is he's a bastard.  He's like a bad guy.  But he's not, though.  He's not really the...  That's what the whole premise of the show was.  Not all the bad guys are bad.  Not all the good guys are good.  But I think what hit people so hard was because it was so unclimactic and so unexpected and  it so was not what everybody wanted to see.  Because that's the way shit happens.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  Exactly.  You know, when you least expect it is when it happens.  And that's very symbolic of where the average state of mind, where the youth is in Baltimore 
[03:26:00]  in the hoods at least.  Life is real cheap out there and that's what's going on.  But me personally as an actor, just, you know, the Michael K. Williams moment, I was kind  of glad that, you know, the whole Marlowe and Omar gun battle in the middle of the street  thing didn't happen.  I think we had shown enough of, you know, the whole black on black thing.  And then, two, I didn't really believe that Omar would have... 
[03:26:30]  I just didn't want them to, like, desecrate his body or, like, you know, to make him torture  or to make him suffer in that kind of way.  So I was kind of glad that, you know, a little kid came and just, you know, put him at rest  as opposed to him having his long dragged out, you know, painful thing with, you know, Marlowe,  Chris, and Snoop.  You know, I didn't want that.  It was leading towards this giant epic thing of these two titan characters where it would  almost become like, oh, that's what TV does.  And when they kill him in a deli, it's fucking... 
[03:27:00]  I haven't seen it.  You're like, what the fuck?  It doesn't matter.  Now you have.  It was, you know, you're like, what the fuck?  It's not going to happen.  It just...  It just...  And it's done.  And the cops are over him.  And when they're...  They're not looking at him like Omar, like the fans are.  The one cop goes, Omar got killed.  He goes, Omar, really?  And then he goes on with the investigation.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  And his rival doesn't even freak out.  He goes, yeah, I know about that. 
[03:27:30]  I thought you were going to come tell me that earlier or something.  It's like...  Oh, shit.  It's a matter of fact.  And as a fan, you're like, what the fuck are you doing?  That's how it's supposed to be.  Very matter of fact.  And I'll tell you something.  It's a great writer.  Wendell Pierce, who plays Bunk, he had a huge problem with that.  He wanted this whole, like, this moment to go through his...  And they were like, absolutely not.  It's just...  It's a matter of fact.  That's too TV, right?  Yeah, that's just another day.  And, like, you know, this year they did the whole on-demand thing, right?  When you could get it the Monday.  So the phone calls started, like, that Sunday night. 
[03:28:00]  Like, at 1 o'clock in the morning that Sunday night going into Monday morning,  the phone calls started.  And it went on through the whole week.  We would just get it on-demand.  It wasn't until that Sunday when it aired, actually aired,  that I had to, like, stop answering my phone for a little bit.  Because it just was, um...  Because, you know, people were coming at me with all the emotion,  just, like, the morning emotion.  And I was pretty good with it.  You know, man, it's so good.  This is a TV show, man.  It's so good.  You know, bigger things ahead.  But there was one phone call that pierced my armor, 
[03:28:30]  and it was from Wendell.  Wendell Pierce, who plays Bunk.  He was somewhere, I think, in New Mexico filming.  I was in Arizona working.  And I was actually on my way back to the airport.  Car full of dudes.  You know, we smoking and, you know, going to the airport,  getting my little mind ready to take this flight back to New York.  And he calls me in the car.  And he, um, the conversation that we had,  and where he was at, you know, as a fan of Omar, 
[03:29:00]  as a friend of mine, and as one of my mentors,  who he knows he helped me to help mold this character  and to handle this type of phenomenon.  For him to hear him on the phone where he was at mentally  and hear the things that he said to me,  it just took me there.  And I was like, yo, Wendell, I cannot go here right now.  I'm in a car for a dude, and you've taken me there.  But it was, yeah, he definitely.  Pushed your buttons there? 
[03:29:30]  He had me welling up in the car.  You guys had an amazing scene together  where he's with a cop, Bumbunk's a cop.  And he's just kind of criticizing the way you handle  being in the neighborhood.  Now there's no sense of community anymore.  And all you do is you sit and listen to the whole thing.  And then at the end of it, you stare straight ahead  and he hocks out the greatest wad of spit.  I don't know why it works so well.  It's just this fucking disgusted.  That was such a great scene between you. 
[03:30:00]  That's probably my favorite bunk scene.  I've never had a bad scene with Wendell, man.  From day one, from when we were first found that we went to high school together.  Oh, yeah, yeah, a few years apart.  Season one, yes.  Sure that wasn't season five?  God almighty.  Shut my fat face.  Wait, weren't you Ted?  You weren't Omar.  Ted.  I got some trivia for you.  Oh.  Who was, um, uh, who, who went and where  and who said for the first time, a man's got to have a cold?  Um, I'll say it was bunk at that, at that first meeting. 
[03:30:30]  Yes, absolutely.  Wow, Jimmy Norton.  Goddamn.  And then when was the second time you heard it?  Shit.  Um.  The shemale, your apartment?  No, no, no.  The shemale said, I'm a man.  And then something with code.  I didn't have enough time to think about that one.  I'm a man, now bend over.  Exactly.  I'm a man, now give me my money.  Before I cut you with a box cutter soaked in garlic. 
[03:31:00]  Gets right into the bloodstream that way.  Oh, yeah.  We've all heard the tragedy stories.  Oh, yeah.  Right in the bloodstream.  And it won't heal.  You'll bleed out.  Yeah, it's very bad.  Very bad.  Oh, shit.  You grind your knife in garlic, and then you stick and you turn.  Oh, problems.  Yeah.  But when was the second time you heard a man gotta have a cold?  It was, um, a man's gotta have a cold.  I'm gonna guess it was, oh, I don't remember.  Master Poe?  Man's gotta have a cold, gentlemen.  Gotta have a cold.  Um, I think it was an Omar callback.  Um, I just don't remember when it was. 
[03:31:30]  You got it.  It was a joke when he got arrested, and he used that, uh, the, um, the get out of free  jail card he got from season two, and he was, because remember they framed him for the  murder in the candy store, Marlo and them, and Bunk would say, that ain't Omar's style.  And he, and he, Bunk came to see, and he was talking, and Bunk was like, man, even if  you didn't kill this one, you killed so many others, I should not let you rot.  He said, because you can sit me in here, but then the people, the man who really killed  that lady is still out there, and he gives him back the card.  The man gotta have a cold.  Oh, shit. 
[03:32:00]  Fuck, I would not have gotten that one.  The first one I did.  You didn't.  I'm amazed you got the first one.  Well, you know, when you're a fan, you fucking remember these things.  No, I gotta hear a little, uh, a little of your rap song here.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  What is the, what is it?  Now, what is the gist of this?  Now, like I said, this all started, this is just Omar on wax.  Omar spitting.  So, the name of the album is Omar's Coming, right?  But this track here, I was in Chicago working on my campaign with Obama, and I'm named Gary  Indiana.  Big up to my Chicago. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, where can I volunteer for that?  I got you.  If you're serious, I got you.  No, he's not.  No, I'm not.  He's a gun nut.  He's a gun nut that makes millions of dollars.  Yes, he wants Wayne LaPierre, and if he's not around, fucking...  I want my taxes cut and bullets.  That's pretty much what I want in life.  I think that's pretty much the American...  Yeah.  Taxes cut and my bullets.  Believe me, McCain's...  I have no love for McCain or the broad that he's running with, but... 
[03:33:00]  I got some love for the broad.  She has a juicy little rump.  Isn't she, though?  Yeah.  You know she fucks, too.  She's got five kids.  Man.  She knows she likes a dick.  Yeah, you look at her, she'd get pregnant.  Four and a half.  Yeah.  Yeah, the last one.  Something a little bad.  The last one, the husband jerked off on her thighs and her feet happened to be up.  Fucking leaking.  Jesus, what's wrong with you?  What?  Oh, damn.  It's just fucking terrible, dude. 
[03:33:30]  Well, that's...  You know, she's got one of those right-to-life stances, so it's one of those, you know...  Sometimes abortion ain't a bad thing.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  If you had a fucking baby with...  If I found out...  If you had a scientist, he'd abort it.  I don't give a shit.  I don't want any kids.  Fuck that noise.  It's a future president, yeah?  Well, it's got a hanger in it.  Fucking beat it.  Here it is.  Your first exam is going to be from Doc Martin.  Right in the fucking belly, you bitch.  I don't need any of that shit. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, I just can't wait until the end of this when I suggest to Michael that he and I, like,  trade numbers or something.  And he's like, oh, my agent's email.  Oh.  Negative.  I'm just saying negative shit.  I don't like the way you just set that up on air so you make shit.  I know, so now it can be done.  Hold on.  You are a fucking chick.  You're a fucking chick.  Hold on.  I know that, but don't deconstruct it until later, stupid.  I was like, hold on.  Let me interview my friend like he's not my friend.  So, Dane, tell us about this motion picture. 
[03:34:30]  That had a hurt, Bobby.  That was totally different.  It wasn't.  You wanted his phone number.  Yes, I didn't believe it.  I was kidding.  You really wanted his number.  You weren't kidding.  Hey, Mike.  You weren't kidding.  What's that, Jim?  You said, uh...  He'll pay for hookers for you and stuff.  My kind of friend.  You need him.  I know.  Hey, we'll get...  My kind of friend.  You're like, Dane, this is a...  This is kind of like an edgy comic.  Which was fine to ask, but it was the way you asked.  You talked to him like you were interviewing him.  I know what I did.  It was different. 
[03:35:00]  No, it wasn't.  Yeah, it was.  Jimmy will be smoking weed.  Oh, no, I won't.  No.  I don't go there.  Oh, no.  I quit many years ago.  That's your problem, my friend.  One demerit.  You don't smoke.  One demerit.  One demerit.  I can live with that.  Why do you smoke weed, Tony?  I get a contact high.  What does that mean?  Off the horge?  Apparently Canadians only smoke pot.  The horrors you have at your house, all 18 of them smoking.  Canadians smoke a lot of pot, don't they, sir?  Some of the best pot come from Canada.  Almost legal.  Some of the best pot in the world comes from Canada.  Yeah, that's where all the good shit is, apparently. 
[03:35:30]  What the good shit is out there, bro?  I hear everyone in Halifax is stoned all the time.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  All the money they should be screaming.  It's a great state of mind to be in.  That's what I hear.  That's why I'm so relaxed over there.  Yeah.  No stress.  The place is clean and relaxed.  They know they got us down south protecting their ass.  That is true.  They create nothing.  They don't even check terrorists.  No.  They're like, you got something strapped to you.  Go out right through the buffalo.  Fuckers.  All right.  Getting back to my record. 
[03:36:00]  Yes.  This is called Omar?  It's called the Mario Remix.  What happened was I was in Chi-Town and this track came to me.  I heard it.  It's actually, the original is with she and Big Boy from Outkast, right?  It's the same vibe song, but I heard it.  And so we remixed it.  And it's called the Mario Remix.  All right.  Give it a listen, man. 
[03:36:30]  Man, the people got questions.  Now we need some answers.  We ain't never been pampered and we tired of getting hammered.  If you tired, then you follow me.  Right up to democracy.  Then you probably see why I be who I be.  See, our rights getting left and our souls getting sold.  And the highest bidder's a kidder.  And this joke's getting old.  So tell me you don't feel the same damn way.  Day after day, like you in long run today.  You got something to accomplish, but it's stuck in the nonsense.  The folk cast is plain ass.  You got to respect that rain check. 
[03:37:00]  Nah, folks, America spilled the yoke a while ago.  Breakfast was supposed to be local.  Instead, it's just local.  You know, so-and-so with the resources, the big bosses.  That flaws, electric college causes.  But you missed electric thinking it was for suburbia.  And now you feel the pain.  America says she never heard you.  Trying to tell us to stay strong.  She does.  But every day we're losing jobs.  Yeah.  College Park got the Beverly Hills.  Yeah.  Something's going to have to get it.  No, that's right.  Across the world they live in fear. 
[03:37:30]  Don't run those days.  Well, it's the same thing over here.  If you can hear me on Capitol Hill.  I hear you, Mary.  Something's going to have to get it.  Now, crime is way up courtesy of me and my diligent.  Cause they never let large percentage.  They fudge them figures.  And the schools, they empty courtesy of political juggling.  Administrators by the fact cause they BS the budgeted.  Now we all out here struggling.  There's something for stumbling.  Man, you gotta dump quite a bit cause the inner city be crumbling.  The advocates is frauds, man.  We need more bras. 
[03:38:00]  Ladies protect their kids.  It's their peers.  They leave you tears.  No longer is it cool to call the white persecuted black.  Look who they turn crook.  Look where they put Martha Stewart at.  When tsunami hit, America came quick.  But when New Orleans got drowned, FEMA couldn't be found.  How profound they clown.  When the poet rests the backbone of this country.  Said they always slip or dis.  If Asia got hit, three thousand miles away.  Why couldn't Ray Ney get it the next damn day?  A single mother and a struggle and it's no fun.  But you don't really understand until you're all one. 
[03:38:30]  A child is sick and he's losing his endurance.  She want to fix him, but she ain't got no insurance.  And we don't even want to talk about the man's plight.  I don't parole with the promise that he'll do right.  But a felon has no chance for a new start.  So it's back to doing hand-to-hand on his own block.  Black and white, we're all the same.  Yeah.  And I know you feel my pain.  And the only hope I have to help me deal with the drama  is that maybe in November I'll be cheering for Obama.  If I'm going to tell us to stay strong. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  But every day we're losing jobs.  Every day.  I was parked out the Beverly Hills.  Ooh.  Something's going to have to get.  Give it up.  Give it up.  Give it up.  Give it up.  But it's the same thing over here.  Over here.  Yeah.  If you can hit me on Capitol Hill.  Listen to me now.  Something's going to have to get.  Give it up.  You fools best believe this lady of ours.  Live for corporate approval.  Get paid by the hours.  Your electric officials.  They just waiting to ditch you. 
[03:39:30]  And your ropes is old news.  Like run down shoes.  Miss you will say she comes to be an M.I.A.  Cause when it come time to protect.  She guilty of neglect.  Your medicine now costs a arm and a leg.  And when the SNS run out.  The seniors going to have to beg.  Now I don't know about y'all.  But Omar real.  I ain't never going to let my mama face that ordeal.  We begging other countries.  Keep the all running free.  And in our own backyard.  Got the starving and the needy.  Police stay seedy.  Fire it well.  They got the cracks beef. 
[03:40:00]  And even they getting killed.  Your teachers was prudent.  But now they sexist students.  You better protect your child.  Cause America's going wild.  But it's not that way.  They've been selling us a dream.  Telling us we're on the same team.  Now we all got to deal with the lies.  There's not a deal.  It's just a small.  Yeah.  But every day we losing jobs.  The college park.  The college park got the Beverly Hills.  Oh.  Oh.  Something's going to have to get.  Oh, that's right.  Across the world they live in fear.  Oh, yeah.  But it's the same thing over here. 
[03:40:30]  Over here, yeah.  You can hear me on capital here.  I know you hear me.  Something's going to have to get, yeah.  Wow.  Damn.  That's great.  Man, that sucked.  Don't joke.  That was kind of interesting.  Really good, man.  That was kind of interesting.  That was kind of interesting.  It was kind of interesting.  Our audience is gone.  They were frightened and left the building.  The building.  Really good, man.  Thank you.  It was very Tupac.  It was very...  Man, you're the second person that said that. 
[03:41:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, it was very Tupac.  Like, you know, some of the stuff.  And it's commercial, too, because you weren't up there fucking suck, you know, fuck my dick.  Well, Omar don't curse.  Anyway, this is strictly a concert record.  It's all Omar.  There'll be no bunch of profanities.  There ain't going to be a bunch of car, fancy car driving, rim spinning, bottle popping, club going, fancy clothes wearing.  None of that.  None of the trappings of what you usually hear is what's going to be on this record.  If this becomes a hit and you have to make a video, will you put Jimmy in your video?  You already made the video.  Absolutely.  No, I mean...  I'd love to be in the video. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, I mean, we got Ike Stapleton.  He shot the new director.  He shot the video.  It's going to be on the...  I'm going a different route with this.  I'm putting this right in the street.  You know what I mean?  So the video is going to be on YouTube, I guess, about another...  And he's heavy at work in the editing room right now.  But I guess another week or so should be starting to air circulate on the YouTube.  Yeah.  So you want this out a little bit before the election?  I mean, it's political.  It's not even really about the election.  You know, I'm involved with the campaign, but I'm by far no politician.  And I don't have any political agenda, if that's what you mean. 
[03:42:00]  It's just I was 3 o'clock in the morning.  I'm in Chicago doing my thing out there with the campaign.  I was high.  I heard the track.  And, you know, it was 3 o'clock in the morning by myself on my homegirls deck.  And this track came to me.  I heard it.  The version with her and Big Boy.  And I was like, I just wanted to lend my voice to it, you know, as Omar.  And just went with it.  That's great.  I was...  Yeah.  You could play Whitey in it.  I'll play...  You can be Whitey.  That's too easy. 
[03:42:30]  I want to play something that challenges me a little more.  Do you know how to dance?  Can you dance a little bit?  Can you be one of the dancers?  Yeah.  Yeah, show us.  Yeah.  Don't there be too much dancing in my project.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be.  No dancing.  Well, not unless he's doing a Josemite Sam dance, you know.  Yeah.  Shooting the guns.  I like to do the Watusi in a shithead.  Okay.  What is the Watusi?  I don't know.  I just like the words.  It's an old dance, I think.  It's an awful dance. 
[03:43:00]  I can't dance a shithead.  I can relate to that song, though, as I'm sitting by my pool.  At poolside.  I'm too white.  Nah.  Nah.  Oh, believe me.  I'm one of those.  I listen to the words and go like, eh, just don't take my goddamn tax money.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, that's really what we all want.  You know what I'm saying?  That's what everybody wants.  Cut government spending. 
[03:43:30]  That's what I say.  No, just don't cut it.  Just give it to me.  All right.  Even better.  Give it to me.  Pass them over this way.  You know what it costs to heat my pool?  A 30 cents a month.  Jimmy doesn't like my jacuzzi.  He says it's cold.  That fucking coldest jacuzzi on the east comes by satin.  It is not.  I finally figured it out.  Would you have to heat up tea water?  Tea water.  Ball of kettle.  Well, Jimmy decided he'd heat it up by pissing in it, you fucking animal.  I fucking dropped it at four gallons of whiz in his fucking jacuzzi. 
[03:44:00]  Yo, let me ask the question.  Is this truth or this is a joke?  They got this new chemical they put in public pools now that when you piss, the water turns like a...  No, the scare kids.  The scare kids.  That's not true, right?  No, it's not true.  Let me say that for 30 years.  I was a kid.  No, that was just some lady...  That would be a great invention, though.  Dude, I don't know about that.  Put it in there, someone pisses, they're just stuck in a bunch of blue.  Blue.  Chastising them.  Yeah, because then some innocent person would swim through it and it blew on their face.  That's been a rumor since I was a kid that they have something they put in the pool. 
[03:44:30]  There's a little thing they put in where you're in...  You urinate, yeah.  She would come back from a pool party with a blue tongue.  Yes.  I'm a bit of a...  It's actually happened to me, though.  It's actually happened to me.  I've seen this yellow stuff, yellow goldish stuff.  Yeah, it's a yellow dye, I think.  It's a yellow dye kind of all around me.  Yeah.  Yeah, when someone pisses, it turns yellow.  So, what's better than the naughtiness of holding a conversation while your dick is floating  straight up because it's water and tinkle is just flowing out of it?  Oh, God.  There's no better feeling than pissing in the pool. 
[03:45:00]  That is a good one.  I swear to God, in water period, that feels good.  But talking about the pool, is that when, you know what I'm saying, the water has it  floating up and you just let it go?  That shit feels good.  Yeah, you're just like...  What happens if you dig...  Gets all warm in your...  Yeah, warm and, you know, cold.  In your shorts.  In your shorts.  Yeah.  What do you...  What do you mean your dick floats up?  Oh, Bobby.  Oh, poor Bobby.  Bob's just stands out like...  Bob making the pool look like the fucking cover of the Nirvana album.  Yeah. 
[03:45:30]  And Michaels is like a U-boat periscope.  They call him Nessie.  AJ, AJ.  Poor Bobby.  He says, what do you mean it stands out?  It floats out.  Does your penis look bad in water?  Yeah.  Really, who's doesn't?  I mean...  If the water's cold, you're fucked.  Cold with a rat.  You're fucked, man.  That's why, you know...  Maybe boys going inside, right inside the stomach.  Whenever...  Because sometimes girls, you know, they want to have sex in a pool or in a lake. 
[03:46:00]  Or a jacuzzi.  And it's too cold.  Well, your jacuzzi's cold.  I know.  Apparently my jacuzzi's cold.  I want to fucking scald you.  I'm going to fill it with boiling water and push you in.  I've never...  And pull out a little Tom Turkey when it's done.  I've never...  I've never actually gotten into a jacuzzi where my fucking balls were tighter when I got out of it than when I got into it.  Come on.  Usually you got to fucking...  You got to steep your scrotum in there very slowly.  Not his.  It works fine now.  Trust me.  But girls, sometimes, you know, you want to have sex in a pool. 
[03:46:30]  And it's probably the worst fucking place to have sex.  First, if it's cold, you're going to have an issue the second you pull your fucking shit down.  And then just the...  There's no lube in a pool.  It gives that...  It's like sliding on a gym floor.  It's not really...  People think because it's wet, it's automatic lubrication.  No!  That's not really the fact.  Plus, if you don't skim the pool, you're jamming fucking mosquitoes in her pants.  A leaf comes out of her pussy. 
[03:47:00]  Well, she'd rather that than sand.  I know that much.  The fucking guy that comes to clean your pool goes in the skimmer and comes out looking like Spunkmeyer from Aliens 2.  Spunkmeyer, what's that on your hand?  Remember?  Fuck.  There we go.  There you go.  I like that one.  I was hoping for a good, rare Aliens reference.  I could hope.  I liked it.  It was funny, but it was just like a really fucking obscure one.  It's still good.  Yeah.  Went with the fucking cum in the skimmer.  There's so much there.  Yeah, there is. 
[03:47:30]  No, I mean there's so much there right now.  A fucking load sticks to your rubber cement.  I thought it was the fucking worst.  What happens when you stick cum in water is that's the last thing you want to do is wash it off.  And then that turns to crazy.  Then you're like,  Mommy, my hand is stuck together.  So the hairs on your legs and shit.  Pulling little wads off of your fucking leg hair.  It's like you're being attacked by your own semen.  A friend of mine used to jerk off in the shower.  He used to call it making eggs.  He goes, I was making eggs in the shower. 
[03:48:00]  I never jerked off in the shower because of that same reason.  I'm like, I got a shower after the shower.  I just redid my shower.  And if you, you know, tile or a bathtub,  the load just goes right down the drain.  But slate, I got black slate for my floor.  Oh, and it just turns immediately to egg.  And then it sticks like the spot, like spawns cape.  We land it.  I'm sitting in there.  Every time I jerk off in the shower,  I have to like jerk off into the drain. 
[03:48:30]  Into the drain.  So it goes down.  Because if not, I'm in there plucking stuff off  one by one little nuggets of fucking my baby eggs.  You have to be a fucking plumber that's got to undo the trap on your fucking...  That happened to me once.  Oh, great.  Because I fucking was...  I used to do...  I used to jerk off into the toilet and just flush it.  But I do my ears too.  And I throw the...  You jerk off in your...  What?  Wait a minute.  What are you doing?  I clean my ears.  What makes you feel sexy when you're going to the toilet?  Yeah.  How do you jerk off?  I'm so not in the mood when I'm shitting in the kitchen.  I don't feel sexy. 
[03:49:00]  I feel fucking...  Horny.  Desperate and alone.  Yeah, exactly.  Lonely, desperate and alone.  Hi, Patty.  I do do that.  You're also all the people's house.  Have you ever joked with someone else's bathroom?  Fuck yes.  I think I've jerked off in this bathroom.  Oh, God.  It smells like a fucking monkey cage in there.  I mean, come on, who hasn't jerked off in the work bathroom?  That is the kind of...  Everybody jerks in the work.  Work bathroom.  Oh, man.  I did when I worked at a funeral home.  Just get a good look at those dead tits. 
[03:49:30]  Have you ever mounted any of them?  Of course I have.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, what else?  What is the term when you screw dead people?  What is that?  Hot.  All right.  You throw her off.  Yeah, necrophilia, right?  Necrophilia, that's what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some people are into that.  Actually, there are some guys that won't go the distance with fucking a dead chick, but  they like girls to bathe in ice water or my jacuzzi.  And they get out and they're just completely cold.  And frigid.  And they just want them to lay on the bed and fuck them that way. 
[03:50:00]  Really?  So they feel really cold.  Yeah.  That's so bizarre.  Yeah.  Like it's a necrophilia fetish.  Yeah.  And then after that, you get the shovel.  You fucking go down to the cemetery.  Find something hot.  Hope I got a good one.  Yeah.  I mean, if you want to fuck someone who's not moving, just date a Jewish girl.  Ooh.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  All Jews.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, Hollywood.  Sorry, Hollywood.  I actually, no, I think you're right about that.  Not, I did Israeli.  And it was...  Israelis and American Jewish girls are completely different. 
[03:50:30]  Israeli chicks are fucking insane crazy.  They're in the army at eight years old.  The worst sex ever.  You ever been fucking a girl and you want to punch her in the face?  She sucks so bad.  The question is, have you ever not?  Of course you do.  Oh, exploding me like Tel Aviv bus.  Yeah, the sexy talk can't be all that hot.  I'll sneak into my asshole like the Mossad in the 72 Olympics. 
[03:51:00]  18, 18.  Oh, Christ, man.  Oh.  Yeah.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, you had an Israeli chick, though?  That was awful.  And she was bad?  She would get on top and her move...  That was it?  Like she's posting on an English saddle?  And then she'd look at me and she'd be like, are you having fun?  Bob's not moving his hips.  Like, just so you people know, he's saying that she would straddle him.  And her hips would stay steady, but she would just kind of move her torso and allow that 
[03:51:30]  weight to push down on his dick.  Just kind of like, yeah, like she's riding an English saddle.  Like she's shrugging.  Actually, one time I was like, stop, stop.  She's like, what's wrong?  I'm like, this just sucks.  This sucks.  Why don't you just throw her off for you and roll her over, do whatever?  Exactly.  Like, you're in there, too.  Yeah, but...  You're fucking choreographing half of the fucking shit.  You don't like what's going on at that moment?  Fix it.  Did she have a fucking...  Was her pussy bald or did she have like a...  A Gaza Strip.  A Gaza Strip. 
[03:52:00]  Shit, I'm big.  You know she didn't have a Hitler mustache.  No.  You know that.  You know that.  You know that.  Gold in my ear mustache.  The broad was hairy.  It was two little curls that hung off her vagina.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, Jimmy hits that all the time.  Pay us.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  A Jewish hooker punk.  Nice. 
[03:52:30]  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Well, any...  We're wrapping up real soon.  Yeah, like five minutes.  Any interesting stories in the crowd?  Oh, sir?  Yes.  If you're not going to see Dane's movies tonight, I was hoping you might come down and see my  friend John Dalby, Dr. Dirty.  You like John?  Yes.  Yes.  And I made that movie here with you guys a bunch of years ago.  What's it called?  What's it called?  I have slacks and camel toe?  No.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit. 
[03:53:00]  Your pants are really tight, sir.  Yes.  And your balls are fucking giant.  Look out.  Look out.  Do the tie-dye.  Holy shit.  You have giant balls.  Okay.  Oh, Jesus.  This kid's all bad.  All right.  Well, that's a nice observation, too.  Wow.  Unlike Omar, though, this is, of course, completely filthy.  You guys remember Dr. Dirty.  Yes, we know.  Do we not remember Dr. Dirty?  And they'll have an opportunity to purchase.  Oh, my God.  I said interesting. 
[03:53:30]  Anyone have anything interesting to say?  What's Pat doing here?  Weren't we supposed to do Wii Fit today or some shit?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Wait, you guys got a Wii Fit already?  Yeah, we were going to do a Wii Fit with a bunch of people that are completely out of  shape.  Like, Pat from Munaki.  Come here, Pat.  Grab a mic.  He was in the Nathan's.  How did you get a Wii Fit?  I've been like, they're like.  No shit.  You know what?  You say it on the air.  You go, I need a Wii Fit.  I need a Wii Fit.  And they pop up.  I need a Wii Fit.  There you go.  Michael needs a fucking Wii Fit.  You're damn right.  I'm wearing my workout clothes.  Yeah.  Pat from Munaki is, he has been, how many years running have you been in the Nathan's Hot Dog 
[03:54:00]  Eating Club?  Last four years.  Last four years.  He doesn't really come in fucking good.  He's really bad at it.  But he qualifies, which is, you know.  I get to the big show.  Yeah.  He gets to the big show and doesn't wear shirts that promote the radio show.  You're not allowed to.  But everyone else is allowed to wear fucking costumes.  You can't promote anything, though.  Is that you crying?  Yeah.  That was actually whimpering.  That was my soul crying.  Let's go whimpering.  It was whimpering. 
[03:54:30]  Pat's got a hell of a life.  He lives in a trailer right at the end of the runway at, where is it, Teterboro?  Yeah.  Airport.  I got evicted from down at the, down at the river.  Oh, crap.  Wow, did you think on that one?  Down by the river.  Oh, here's that joke.  Back goes Griffey, looking up.  It's out of here.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  Oh, shit.  I thought it was going to be a...  Damn.  And then it, yeah.  It was like a Neil Young song and Chris Farley and I just screwed up. 
[03:55:00]  Pat's skinny fat.  Isn't that funny?  Like, look at his legs.  Pat is just, he's like, he's sexy fat.  Like, he's happy with his body weight.  But did you see him?  I tip over a lot.  Yeah, but you were dropping.  You were a pretty good dancer.  He was dropping it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what they know him for, dancing and vomiting eggnog.  Yes.  Yeah.  You were supposed to wee fit, though.  Yeah.  I was all right.  I was going to get a headband, wristbands.  I was going to get a lap band.  Wow, are you bombing. 
[03:55:30]  You are tanking.  And, yeah, so you were all set up for it and everything with the let's get physical wear.  Yeah.  Only you have two breasts.  Hey.  All right.  It was really inappropriate.  It was too wrong with you, dude.  Yeah.  Cruel.  It's not accurate.  I know.  That's all right.  Not wrong with a little man tittery now and then.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Enough of you, Pat.  What about Big A, quickly? 
[03:56:00]  Big A, what were you here for?  The same thing?  You were going to do a wee fit?  You can't do the wee fit.  It's too big.  What?  Yeah, I was here.  I was going to do the wee fit.  Yeah?  You tell me I'm so fit.  Wow.  What the fuck are you saying?  What did you say?  Come up, Andrew.  Come up.  You're way back there.  Yeah.  You're wearing, I see you're wearing stripes to make yourself look thinner.  That's good.  You look like a beach ball trying to bust out of jail.  That's kind of, I don't know. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, but you were here for the wee fit.  Okay.  Are you going to hang out for, are you hanging out for running fast?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Dude, you need to lose the sweat-ass shirt, the Hawaii shirt.  It's crazy.  Yeah, that's nuts.  Wow.  That's a nice shirt.  Now you're sporting.  No, no, no.  There you go.  There you go.  Hide your balls.  That's right.  It's my Jimmy Buffet shirt.  It's five o'clock.  I almost said Jimmy Buffet.  All right, back down. 
[03:57:00]  All right, that's pretty good.  I'd love to use it.  Would you?  Absolutely.  Is that what the construction crew said?  We fit his balls in these pants?  I bet you he does it on purpose, too.  Like, he probably stretches his balls out and then rubber bands them tightly, just so people  comment on them and girls like them.  Yeah. 
[03:57:30]  So, Andrew, what were you saying?  Yeah, Andrew, what were you trying to say?  He kind of looks like a successful you.  Yeah, there is something there.  There is definitely something there.  The brother you have to take care of your whole life.  Great Chinese.  Yeah.  Big A, so what happened?  You were here for WeFit.  Yes.  Yeah.  Did you think you had a chance at getting one of the better scores?  No.  No.  No.  What are you doing tonight?  It's Friday. 
[03:58:00]  Any parties going on?  Any message board parties?  I'm planning on going to Parsippany to see Dustin Diamond.  Are you shitting me?  Parsippany to see Dustin Diamond?  Dustin Diamond with Screech from Saved by the Bell.  Are you really going to Parsippany to see Dustin Diamond?  I want to see the train wreck.  That's why.  Where is he performing?  At my house.  Where is he performing? 
[03:58:30]  Quickly, where is he?  Where, where, where?  Andrew, where?  Andrew, Parsippany, where?  What's the place?  What place?  Andrew, where?  The place is...  Oh, man.  What's the place?  Andrew, where is it?  Hotel.  No, but where?  Rwanda?  The Overlook?  The Overlook, yeah.  Andrew's stance is so fucking wide.  Looks like he's made out of cardboard.  He needs a wide stance.  You don't put a small foundation on a giant building. 
[03:59:00]  Well, look at this.  Look at Pat.  Yeah, look at him.  He looks like a fucking nine-year-old going to fucking school from the waist down.  Should be ACPC.  Hey.  Oh, wow.  You just can't get one out, can you?  All right.  Why would you see Dustin Diamond in Parsippany?  Oh, let's see.  There's no other fucking comics in Manhattan on a Friday night that you can go see? 
[03:59:30]  Who's like down at Caroline's or something?  You have something going on with Dustin Diamond?  Oh, no, no.  Do you want to be his friend or something?  You all want money?  I said I'm supporting my friends at JJComedy.  JJComedy.com.  Oh, wow.  Those poor bastards.  How are you supporting your friends there by seeing Dustin Diamond?  Is it JJComedy or is it just Jay and you said it twice?  JJComedy.com.  No, no.  It's JJComedy.com.  JJ, JJComedy.com. 
[04:00:00]  All right.  You going to hang out for Ron and Fez?  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, okay.  You've kind of been outshined by a fucking weirdo there who does his little bad fucking  rapping.  What's his name?  Crazed.  Yeah, Crazed.  Who?  Oh, you don't acknowledge him?  I heard he was talking bad about you, Anthony.  He always talks a little smack about me.  I would never do that.  Yeah, okay.  Someone talking smack about you?  At least you're not googly-eyed like him.  No, I'm not. 
[04:00:30]  He is quite the weirdo.  But you see him, he comes on Pal Talk every so often and just gets lambasted until he's  got to leave.  Yeah.  He's a kook.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get out of there.  Attractive girls are the only thing that should ever be on Pal Talk.  For me and Jim, it's like eBay.  That's right.  Pal Talk.  Pull your cock out and see who bites.  You wave it in the camera.  Pal Talk.  All right.  Enough rambling.  I'm not going to go to a quarter after.  Fuck you, people. 
[04:01:00]  It's Friday.  I'm going to party.  Oh, what do you got there, Halifax?  I want to thank Jimmy for turning me on with a wire.  I think it's a fantastic series.  I loved it.  I just finished season five.  Oh, good.  But I got a question for Michael.  Did you keep your jacket from the show?  Yes, I did, actually.  Oh.  Yeah, I did.  And the producers, they put it in this air-tight frame box kind of thing.  And they put on the years that Omar lived with the Omar Devone Little, 2002, 2005, or 2008. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah.  And it's funny, because we were very similar.  You know, I have my sweater from Lucky Louie as well.  But nobody put it in a case.  Pamela mailed it to me in a box.  She got the sweaters in here.  And it wasn't actually dated.  They just put a clock on the bottom with the time.  A flame clock, right?  Exactly.  8.15, 8.30.  15 minutes are up.  Jizz bucket.  I got a die-cast metal Torgasm logo to hang around my neck. 
[04:02:00]  Why not?  You're like something hanging around Danes.  He goes, yeah, I have a 300-pound albatross.  I don't like this.  He's just as much as a coattail jumper.  Dice, O&A, fucking Colin, back to O&A, over to Louie, back to O&A.  Jimmy's a success hopscotch player.  Hey, I'm a bullfrog on a bunch of lily-pad coattails.  I'll fucking hop from one or the other forever. 
[04:02:30]  What do I care?  Yeah, that's right.  Exactly.  But I would say, how about a nice hand for our guest, the great Michael K. Williams.  I like when a guest can hang out and just have fun with us for the whole show.  Fantastic, man.  It's one of the greatest radio stations I've ever been in, man.  I've never seen with the audience ever.  It's fun, right?  Yeah, it's just hanging out.  It's bullshit, and that's pretty much what this show is.  We don't know what we're doing on a daily basis.  And that's what it should be.  Well, as long as the bosses think we prepare, we're okay.  Well, you know, you called to wish me a happy birthday. 
[04:03:00]  That was fucking, we got you on the phone.  That was great.  And it was supposed to be a big surprise.  But then Roland, where's Roland?  Yeah, Roland blew the whole thing.  There he is.  Here he comes.  Roland.  There's Roland.  You said that Michael was a difficult guy to interview.  No, I did not say that.  He did say that.  But he said, like, the day Michael called in for my birthday was a big surprise.  And Roland goes, well, Michael can't call in until after nine.  I'm like, good.  Great.  Thanks. 
[04:03:30]  Blew the surprise.  Do you think if Al-Qaeda cut his head off, they play volleyball with it?  They'd probably eat out of it.  Well, like it would be one of those comedy clips where they'd cut it off and it would  roll away and they'd be going, it's rolled.  It's so scary.  It's so round.  It's just, I'm not saying it's bad looking.  I'm just saying it's very round.  They'd wear it on holidays.  That was a damn good one.  Roland didn't think so.  Nothing wrong with the chug bob.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[04:04:00]  Roland would never do that.  Roland's got a very violent side.  Yeah, he's a psychopath.  He's our sweet, mild-mannered booker and a psychopath.  It's the quiet ones that are good.  Always.  He's crazy.  He's insane.  What up, bird?  Look, we're bailing on line of the day.  I could give a shit.  I think everybody shared on line of the day.  But we must thank, of course, Carbonite.com.  You want to back up your hard drive?  Go to Carbonite.com.  You can't just have your computer and not back up your hard drive and be like Anthony and lose a bunch of pictures when your hard drive takes a shit. 
[04:04:30]  And you want to get hard.  You need your pictures.  Yeah.  The hard drives can get hard.  Lots of hard.  You know what I'm saying?  You don't want to lose those pictures you fucking broke the law to get.  Exactly.  Because they grow up and you can't photograph them anymore.  You know?  Nice photos.  Nice footage of your coffee table there.  Right.  The coffee table.  Those are nice family memories, you know?  Family?  My gray coffee table.  Your gray coffee table. 
[04:05:00]  I don't even want to think of your gray balls.  Like dead skin.  And two quick plugs.  I'll be at the Wilbur Theater for the third show Friday, November 15th.  I'm only doing one show that night.  Tickets are on sale now.  The Saturday shows are sold out.  And, of course, Michael K. Williams is in Spike Lee's new movie.  The Miracle of St. Anna comes out in theaters everywhere September 26th.  Be there.  Get that history.  A week from tonight.  And, of course, The Wire is on DVD.  I think it's the greatest series I've ever seen. 
[04:05:30]  Got to thank Michael Chiklis and Dane Cook also.  Yes.  Michael for coming in.  Dane for calling.  Good show.  Your song can be found on YouTube.  What's it called?  It's called The Mary O. Remix.  Mary O. Remix.  It's not on YouTube yet, though.  I think so.  I'm not sure.  How about iTunes?  I think iTunes, yeah.  Okay.  Go to iTunes and look for it.  Just Google Omar.  You'll find it.  Bobby, any plugs?  Yeah.  Go to my MySpace.  MySpace slash Robert Kelly Live.  And I get the October 24th Wilbur Theater.  I have one show. 
[04:06:00]  Okay.  And maybe not even that.  Yes, you'll have a show.  Bobby's very funny.  Well, I didn't want to do three, but the first two are sold out.  What am I going to do?  Not do a third one?  Oh.  Oh, just rub that in.  Oh, Jesus.  Can't help it.  Also, too, if it's okay, if I can leave my website, michaelkennethwilliams.com.  michaelkennethwilliams.com.  Holla, it's your boy.  Check it out.  All right.  Thanks, man.  And audience, thank you so much.  Always a pleasure to have you in.  Canada in the building.  It's Friday.  Let's start drinking.  Bye.  It's Friday.  Friday.  Look, he started to touch me. 
[04:06:30]  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car.  What do you want, fucko?  You want something, huh?  What are you doing?  Oh, no.  Fuck. 
[04:07:00]  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I swear to my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead.  Hold my hand, man.  I got to squeeze something.  Ah, fuck.  Shit. </pre>
