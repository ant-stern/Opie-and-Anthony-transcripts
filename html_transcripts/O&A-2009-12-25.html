<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Christmas bonuses, sparked by a disgruntled employee's complaint. This segued into a raunchy, extended bit about the Snuggie, featuring a caller, Chris from New York, sharing his frustrating experience ordering one.  The hosts and callers dissected the Snuggie infomercial's perceived manipulative marketing tactics.  This was followed by a humorous, and obscene, original song about "jingle balls."

Next, Ann recounted her disastrous Christmas Eve, which involved heavy drinking, a fall, profanity-laced yelling, and missing her own party.  This led to stories about her subsequent hangover and a humorous encounter with a police officer who recognized her from a previous incident involving a red Ferrari.  The conversation then shifted to Ann's disdain for movie theaters and a listener's anecdote about a sick moviegoer.  The segment ended with a discussion about the lack of Christmas movies on demand and a review of Spider-Man 3, including jokes about the Sandman.  Throughout this section, the show was rife with vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor.

Anthony then began a segment discussing his Christmas gifts, including a canceled check from Pete Maravich and, more controversially, a 1938 German Mauser rifle with swastika markings.  This led to a rambling, offensive monologue about Merry Christmas greetings in different countries, culminating in a song about the perceived advantages of being Jewish at Christmas.  The show then featured "Stalker Patty," who presented Opie and Anthony with a handmade, framed Xerox copy of a Penthouse magazine cover.  After much playful resistance, Opie destroyed the gift, leaving Patty visibly upset.

The next segment focused on Frankie Blue, a program director at their former station WNEW.  The hosts played multiple audio clips documenting Blue's heavily intoxicated, on-air meltdown after a Christmas party, showcasing slurred speech and misidentification of the station's call letters. Earl, the board operator, was in studio and professed ignorance of the incident's details.  The hosts discussed WNEW's declining performance since their departure and Blue's apparent incompetence, along with their own opinions on mandatory Christmas tipping, using offensive language to describe both givers and receivers.  They also shared anecdotes about buying gifts for family members, particularly the difficulties of introducing older relatives to new technologies.

The show continued with a listener's anecdote about his father ordering Harry Potter movies and lubricant online.  This transitioned into a segment featuring a Christmas song by Sleeves, which prompted strongly divided reactions from callers and the hosts.  The conversation then shifted to the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), with the hosts playing clips and highlighting its perceived awfulness, including its bizarre plot, poor acting, and celebrity guest appearances (Beatrice Arthur, Art Carney, Jefferson Starship).  A voicemail from comedian Rich Voss attempting to obtain Jingle Ball tickets was also played.

The final segment further dissected the bizarre elements of the Star Wars Holiday Special, including the cartoon segment featuring Boba Fett's first appearance, Diane Carroll's dance, and Princess Leia's song with Jefferson Starship.  The hosts speculated on the reasons for the special’s incoherent structure. A caller confirmed the special's availability on YouTube in parts. This segment then devolved into another Christmas-themed section filled with vulgar and sexually explicit jokes, songs, and anecdotes, including references to Santa Claus, Christmas parties, bodily functions, and sexual acts.  A caller shared a story about their wife’s "camel toe," provoking further explicit jokes.  Jesse Ventura made a brief, unexpected appearance as a guest before abruptly leaving.  The show concluded with a promotion for "Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2009," a Christmas edition.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I lost my temper when I got my bonus, and I guess I said a few things I shouldn't have.  Bonus? How did you get a bonus?  I cut out bonuses this year.  Yeah, and thanks for telling us.  I've gotten a Christmas bonus every year but this one.  You don't want to give bonuses, fine.  But when people count on them as part of their salary,  oh, what you did just plain sucks.  Thank you, Russ.  Ho, ho, ho!  Merry Christmas! 
[00:00:30]  A month or two ago, you asked me for a date.  You said for Christmas Eve, by then you'd lose some weight.  I think I understand the tinsel in your hair.  But why have you got mistletoe inside your underwear?  Oh, jingle balls, jingle balls, jingle to and fro.  Watching all the little puppies making yellow snow. 
[00:01:00]  Jingle balls, jingle balls, jingle one bee.  If I don't come over here and jingle balls look weird.  Splashing in your gash in a one-horse open sleigh.  My parents think you're trash, but I think you're okay.  Filling heart balloons from a nozzle up my ass.  I'd like to fill another, but I think I'm on a gas.  So, jingle balls, jingle balls, jingle to and fro. 
[00:01:30]  Watching all the little children eating yellow snow.  Jingle balls, jingle balls, jingle one bee.  Why don't you come over here and jingle balls with me?  Why don't you come over here and jingle balls with me?  Yee-haw!  Yee-haw!  Oh, my God.  What's going on?  It's the worst of Obi and Anthony.  It's stupid.  Something ridiculously loud and obnoxious.  I sound like the best of Dallas Syndrome record. 
[00:02:00]  We're never going to make everybody happy.  So, why do we have to now make more people not happy?  Oh, no.  It's stupid.  It's audio drama.  If I may use the word duty.  It's the worst of Obi and Anthony.  So, what happened, Ann?  Where are you going to start?  You fell down.  You got pulled over and you missed your own Christmas party.  What do you need from me here?  Or should I just sit back and enjoy?  I guess we'll start with our last day on the air that we had.  What happened?  No, nothing happened. 
[00:02:30]  But that's kind of when my vacation started.  When the Ron and Fez show started.  That's when I started drinking.  Which was a Tuesday?  You never stopped drinking.  What was it, Tuesday?  You mean you push it to the next level.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The official binge.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it was vacation party time.  Right.  So, that's when I started.  And then it didn't stop until, I guess, last night at about 10.  Uh-huh. 
[00:03:00]  But Christmas Eve was the night where I went to my aunt and uncle's house.  All the relatives are over.  Nice.  And we do now Secret Santa.  Yeah.  We don't get gifts for everybody.  Because it's a pain in the ass.  There's no way I was going to a department store.  I'd see it on the news and be like, I'll kill someone.  Yeah.  I'll kill someone if I have to go into one of those places.  Can I jump in for one second? 
[00:03:30]  I know, like, this is all you.  Trust me.  But just a quick little side note.  Discussion.  I also had a Christmas party for my family.  Yeah.  And my nephews and nieces are, like, getting old enough where they're kind of on to me.  Uh-oh.  And they come up to me like, so, what did you get me for Christmas?  Because all my other brothers were, like, brought all their presents over to my house.  And I said, uh, I threw this fine party for you.  You get a party.  That's what you get.  Thank you.  I had a lot of candy and a lot of kids type of food. 
[00:04:00]  But I, like you said, I'm not going to deal with trying to figure out what these little brats want.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  We heard you.  We heard you.  I heard it.  I'm like, a little slow.  We heard you.  So I'm with you.  But you guys do the secret.  Well, we do the secret.  See, we used to get everybody.  Everyone got everybody something.  And I would wait until the last minute and go nuts, out of my mind, in stores, just buying stupid things that no one's going to need. 
[00:04:30]  Gloves and slippers.  Yeah.  You want a Snuggie?  How many times did you see the goddamn Snuggie commercial?  What is a Snuggie?  Oh, a blanket is so inconvenient, Opie.  Yeah.  Because you've got to put it on you.  And, oh, I can't cover everything.  But the Snuggie is a blanket with sleeves.  What?  Yeah, so they're showing this old bald guy in a chair that looked like a monk.  He said, look how inconvenient the blanket is.  She's like, oh, and then I've got to grab for the phone, and now I'm cold again. 
[00:05:00]  Why is she annoyed that she has to, ew.  The Snuggie is a robe you wear like a straitjacket.  It's the bed.  You put the robe, look at the monk.  It makes you look like a monk.  You're right.  And it's got sleeves.  Look at this happy fella.  But they act like a blanket is trying to operate the Whopper computer.  I know.  Take a blanket, you morons.  I did not see this commercial.  Dude, this was on every two seconds.  They look like they're part of a cult.  They do.  Everything, this Snuggie, or every infomercial makes whatever they're selling look like the answer to your dreams. 
[00:05:30]  Because whatever it's replacing is so inconvenient.  I saw the one for glasses, for the sunglasses.  This thing.  The HD wraparounds.  HD wraparounds.  And they're talking about the sun gets in your eyes.  And some people use clip-on sunglasses for their prescription glasses. 
[00:06:00]  And they show the guy clip them on.  And then he's blocking the sun out from the sides and looking like, oh, these don't work.  Like, everything's inconvenient.  Like, he just walked into a nuclear reactor.  And the brightness is killing him.  But then he puts the other glasses on and everything's fine.  Same thing with the Snuggie.  You put a blanket on you and it flies off of you.  She's using a flying carpet trying to cover herself.  Yeah, I don't understand why you would be annoyed trying to work a blanket. 
[00:06:30]  So now you have a blanket with sleeves.  The Snuggie.  That thing looks awful.  I saw this all Christmas season long.  This commercial was on.  Yeah.  And every time I'm just like, this stupid Snuggie.  The website is www.getsnuggie.com.  Get Snuggie.  Oh, I want that thing covered in pre.  The crusty. 
[00:07:00]  The Snuggie is just awful.  Who wants a sleeved blanket?  I know.  It's not a blanket anymore.  Funny you should ask, Jimmy.  Funny you should ask.  Let's say hi to Chris in New York.  Chris?  Uh-oh.  Chris.  Hi.  Hi, Chris.  Hi there.  I called because I ordered a Snuggie because my daughter said she wanted it.  And then later on I found out she was only joking.  You dummy.  I know.  But what a trauma they put you through. 
[00:07:30]  You know, you call, you think you're going to order this thing, but no, you have to go through.  The call lasted 15 minutes.  Yeah, let me tell you something about everything you order on television.  It's a scam.  Everything is some kind of scam to try to sign you up for other stuff.  They try to sell you other stuff.  They get your number, which they then sell to other companies.  It's amazingly ridiculous what they do. 
[00:08:00]  And then the big thing now that they're doing with all these infomercials is, but wait, we'll send you a second Snuggie.  Pay separate shipping and handling.  And then the shipping and handling is just about as much as the Snuggie.  Yeah.  That must be how they make their money.  And don't forget the little book light, too.  Snug Danny?  Yes, Snug Danny?  Oh, yeah, there's a book light?  Yeah.  I don't remember exactly what product it was for, but they were trying to backsell you on what they had just shown you. 
[00:08:30]  And we're throwing in a USB cable, and they showed a USB cable, and they're like, this USB cable is a $25 value, and you're getting it free.  It's like it's a four-cent cable that everyone has 50 of.  Yeah.  I don't know one person that doesn't have 50 USB cables laying around the house.  $25 value, yours, absolutely free.  Wow, thanks.  Thanks for that.  They'll throw in zip strips and these special plastic ties to hold it together.  So, you get this, this, the zip strips, and this, a $90 value for $10. 
[00:09:00]  But wait, we'll double the order.  What?  Just pay separate processing.  Yes, separate processing and shipping.  They call it processing and shipping, not even handling anymore.  You know it's some minimum wage Mexican guy that's working in this place.  He's not making eight bucks a pop on boxing this thing up.  Unbelievable.  So, did you like the Snuggie? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I haven't even gotten it yet.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  They didn't get it.  There's a demand that, you know, it's going to take weeks for me to get this, but they did already charge me.  Of course they did.  Yeah.  This thing is awful.  Six to eight weeks delivery, by the way.  Thanks, Chris.  All right.  Six to eight weeks.  Six to eight weeks delivery.  They probably hand-make them as they get ordered because there's only three people that want a Snuggie.  And I hope they're really flammable.  Like, I hope what gives them their great color is the gasoline type of color dye. 
[00:10:00]  That's what you have to use.  You have a cigarette.  Because the same people also sell, like, face burn bandages.  You can't get out of your Snuggie because you're all sleeved in.  Yeah, you're sleeved in there.  You can't just throw it off like a flaming blanket.  You drop and roll, and it just wraps around you like burning plastic.  Nice.  This sticks to your body.  Hey, here's the Snuggie commercial.  You want to keep warm when you're feeling chilled.  All right.  Then turn up the heat or get a stupid blanket. 
[00:10:30]  Get a blanket.  No, no.  Blanket.  Listen, she'll tell you why a blanket sucks.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes.  I'm the dummy.  I'm the dummy.  The woman in the commercial is actually nailing the blanket to her calf so it doesn't fly off.  Get a hold of yourself, miss.  It's a blanket.  It's a dumb blanket.  She's acting like it's a wolverine she's trying to put on herself.  Panic stricken.  You want to keep warm when you're feeling chilled, but you don't want to raise your heating bill. 
[00:11:00]  Blankets are okay, but they can slip and slide.  And when you need to reach for something, your hands are trapped inside.  Now, there's the Snuggie.  Trapped inside?  What is she talking about?  Your private pile.  You could get trapped and beaten, but with soap.  Who's ever had to call 911 to be taken out of a blanket because you couldn't get bonbons with a remote control?  Dummies.  What was the private pile?  Has anyone ever had a perm with a blanket?  No. 
[00:11:30]  I'm trying to think if I've ever had a real problem with a blanket.  One time, honestly, I was watching TV and I was going to reach for something.  And when I reached my arm out, the blanket kind of came off my arm.  Oh, no.  So I had short sleeves on and the arm was temporarily chilly.  Yeah.  But then I got what I was supposed to get and I took the blanket with the hand that was still covered and I flipped it over and then my other arm was covered too.  It was fine again.  So you didn't even need sleeves on a blanket.  No, but it would have been so nice because I wouldn't have gotten that little chill that I got. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  But I was reaching for the lubricant.  And how about the fact that your hands are sticking out and cold?  Yeah.  Like part of the blanket is getting your hands under there.  I'm sure they figured that out.  Getting all warm.  No, they haven't.  Oh, no.  Look, she's reading a book and her hands are sticking out.  She's wearing a backwards robe.  It's a robe straight jacket.  Tie it in a knot in the back and beat your grandma as she wears a stupid snug.  Yeah, but you got easy access to grandma's backside. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And who doesn't want that?  Yeah, you can take a dump in it while you're still nice and warm.  That's what they call the dump blanket.  It comes like on the top thing.  It's like a toilet paper roll holder.  And when you need to reach for something, your hands are trapped inside.  Now there's the Snuggie, the blanket that has sleeves.  The Snuggie keeps you totally warm and gives you the freedom to use your hands. 
[00:13:00]  She's describing clothing.  Yeah.  Or read a book in total warmth and comfort.  It's a dress.  Use your laptop without being cold.  Or enjoy a snack while staying snugly warm.  Ew.  If they use another version of the word Snuggie.  Snuggie.  Sounds like a fetish.  I'm a Snuggie.  Right.  My daughter's a Snuggie lover.  Kind of has that plushie, right?  Yeah.  I know where you're going. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, the plushies.  That was all over the place, though, for Christmas.  I swear to God, this is the first I'm hearing of the Snuggie.  I've been a little out of touch.  I've been a little out of touch.  Tom on Long Island's got a little more on the Snuggie.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Jimmy, I love the book, man.  Thank you very much, Paul.  The best part about the commercial fellas is that they're at a sporting event.  The whole family wearing Snuggies, looking like a cult.  Will they high-five each other?  Yeah.  They did show that day.  He's right.  They're like in the bleachers.  Yeah, they are.  I would wear that to a game. 
[00:14:00]  That's embarrassing.  Watch them high-fives.  That's embarrassing.  Watch the Snuggie family high-five.  I try to hold it so the snipers know who to hit.  I hope that's why they're wearing the Snuggies.  He hates these Snuggies.  He has a high-five.  But the cold dorm room was good.  And those drafty dorm rooms.  Look at her.  And you know the back is easy access because it's open like a blanket.  She's dating two players from the same basketball team and they don't know it.  She has two different colored Snuggies. 
[00:14:30]  Because each time one comes and leaves, they stain it.  Yo, why is your Snuggie standing up by itself?  That's machine washable.  Hold on.  What is it?  How else would you wash it?  No.  Harlequin girl from Buffalo writes,  My grandmother bought my husband a Snuggie, but she got him the generic one from Harriet  Carter, I guess.  Local something, maybe.  It needs to be assembled around you with snaps, which he's too lazy to do. 
[00:15:00]  So he walks around the house in this cape like a superhero.  Snuggie?  With snaps?  What is this one?  What's this one?  Dave.  How are you, Dave?  How's it going, guys?  My sister bought my mom, it's the QVC version called a blanket.  And when my mom opened it on Christmas morning, she started crying.  And my sister's like, what's wrong?  And she's like, are you putting me in a nursing home?  Because I can work a blanket.  What's wrong with you?  I'm so good to you. 
[00:15:30]  Crying when she gets a Snuggie.  That's one of those, we should have a list, but it's one of those gifts, you get somebody  that you don't give a crap about.  Here, take this Snuggie, take this Chia Pet, take this.  Crap gifts.  You're off my dumb list.  So what is the Slank It?  It's just the same thing.  Same thing as a Snuggie, a sleeved blanket.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Slank It.  Slank It.  I hate when they combine words.  Stop it.  Why? 
[00:16:00]  Don't do that.  They're fun, Jimmy.  It's not.  They're fun.  It's not.  Unless they combine, like, who's your friend?  Oh, he's a Canadian runt.  Boo.  Ah, boo.  Boo.  Boo.  Boo.  John in Orange County.  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  Listen, my mother-in-law bought us five Snuggies for Christmas, and I think they're made out  of the same material as Sam Wow.  The Nathief. 
[00:16:30]  Absolutely ridiculous.  Yeah, the Sham Wow's another biggie.  Yeah.  That's...  Yeah, but let me tell you.  Let me tell you something.  It's Snuggie.  I feel like I'm in the church choir when I put it on.  Yeah.  Now, Fernando brings up a good point.  I'm sure they'll...  Fernando.  I'm sure they'll dump out down the hall, but someone out there will hear this.  Go ahead, Fernando.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Who?  Great show.  I just wanted to point out that if you got the Snuggie and you're a guy, you're trapped 
[00:17:00]  on the Snuggie.  You can't masturbate.  If you're watching porn on the computer or through on a DVD, you're trapped under it  and you can't.  There's no access to your...  You get busted easier now.  There's no access to your Peter.  The Snuggie should have like a little doggy drawer on the front.  It's all a conspiracy, man.  I hear you.  They want us to join cults.  No, well...  You know the thing's just falling off of your shoulders when you stand up.  Oh, yeah.  It's not connected to your back.  So we went off on a tangent. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  I was talking about presents and stuff and how we had to do Secret Santa.  So I only have to get one gift for somebody.  On Thanksgiving, we actually pass around the old hat and pull the names out.  We gave up on that, but we did that for years.  And then Christmas, you get that person a gift.  Does the person that pulled your name just try not to show the over-the-top excitement?  No, because they've got to get me something.  Oh, it goes like...  It's a secret.  So I pick a name and I have to get somebody something.  Oh, I see.  They don't know it's from me.  Okay, I got you. 
[00:18:00]  I got you.  So I got my uncle and decided, because he likes wine, to get a really, really, really good bottle of wine.  A decanter.  Nice.  A nice decanter to a decant.  I got four of those if anybody needs one.  A decanter.  What does a decanter do, by the way?  It lets the wine breathe.  It's just another excuse to buy stuff.  Open it and drink it.  No, the guy at the wine store told me this has to breathe for an hour.  He goes, pour some in a glass and then pour the rest in the decanter and then taste the glass and then taste what's in the decanter. 
[00:18:30]  It lets some of the alcohol burn off a little bit.  I've heard all that, but I can't tell the truth.  Dude, it really is.  And it was an amazing bottle of wine.  Very good.  But, well, I was drinking a lot of wine on Christmas Eve.  A lot of wine.  And then, yeah, I went home and thought once I got home, thank God you got a driver. 
[00:19:00]  I put the cruise control on.  One less thing I have to worry about is how fast I'm going.  And then I keep it in the right lane.  And you calculate.  What's the speed?  Because you don't want to be perfect because that's suspicious.  About 62.  62 is the speed.  That's 62.  In a 35 zone.  Over lawns.  Knocking over mailboxes.  Driving through people's backyards. 
[00:19:30]  Got wine in the car.  Yeah.  So, well, I got home.  Although the next day Keith did tell me, he goes, your truck was a little in the middle of the driveway.  Usually, you're, you know, one side or the other.  But I didn't think I was just parking for room.  So, I get home.  It's Christmassy.  On the way, by the way, on the way, I'm thinking, I might go to the carousel.  Of course.  And if I had gone there, I would have drank beer. 
[00:20:00]  And it would have just put me over the top.  One brain cell that was left in my head that hadn't been affected told me, no, just go home, you idiot.  That's some responsibility.  That's nice.  So, I went home.  Not the responsibility we're hoping for, but all right.  And now I got pumps on my pool cover.  Right.  Pumps the water off, you know.  How wasted were you?  I was doing pretty good.  Yeah.  I was doing pretty good.  So, I go out back with a flashlight because I had to defrost the pumps before I left. 
[00:20:30]  So, I go out to check when the pump's working.  So, I get the little flashlight.  I go out back.  And there was a strip of ice.  It had to be, I don't know, 12 inches long by 5 inches wide.  Nothing.  And I slipped on that ice and went down.  And it was after midnight, so it's officially Christmas.  So, the neighbors got to hear Santa yelling the C word, the F word, the S word. 
[00:21:00]  I was screaming curses as I'm just laying down on my patio.  What kind of fall?  Was it like a cartoon fall?  No, it was a...  Quickly on your back?  It was a...  My left foot went out from under me.  I went down on the side of my kneecap and the side of my elbow, which really hurt.  Not at the time.  At the time, I'm just like, ah, you fell.  That sucks.  So, then I finally, you know, go to bed. 
[00:21:30]  You're like the old lady from the medical alert commercial?  Yes, I've fallen.  My son, Michael, got me the life call alert.  So, I went to bed, and now my party is Christmas Day, which I've told everybody to come over at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  Family, friends, presents, catered.  Yes.  All in.  Told everyone 2 o'clock.  Right.  It's not bad.  I think it was about 3 in the morning when I finally got to sleep.  Plenty of time. 
[00:22:00]  Plenty of time.  I woke up at 9 in the morning with one of the worst hangovers in history.  It was so bad that I was just...  My head was pounding and spinning.  I was woofing.  You puked?  Oh, yeah.  I was just puking.  Aren't you too old to be puking?  My hangovers are bad.  I don't puke when I'm drunk.  Like, some people puke when they're drinking.  I'll puke hours later. 
[00:22:30]  Sometimes a day later, I'll puke.  Jeez.  It's horrible.  My hangovers are terrible.  Hangovers are directly proportional to how good of a time you were having the night before, though, because what fun I had.  That's a sign from God.  It's not.  It's alcohol.  God is telling you something.  And so now, it's starting to creep up.  I'm laying in bed.  I got a wet rag on my head, and I'm writhing in pain.  And I'm looking at the clock, and time is flying by, and I'm not getting any better. 
[00:23:00]  And I'm thinking, it's going to come up on 2 o'clock, and I'm not going to be able to even answer the door.  What does the wet rag get up?  It just keeps my head cool, and my eyes and my head hurt so bad that the coolness feels good.  So I took some aspirin and that, and I'm drinking water like crazy, just trying to feel better.  And thank God I get a text from Keith that says, I'll be over in a little bit.  I'm like, door's open.  So I trod downstairs, unlock the door, go back upstairs, puke a little more, lay down in bed, and figure Keith is there, everything's taken care of. 
[00:23:30]  2 o'clock rolls around, I start hearing people coming to the party, and I'm still in bed.  I'm laying in bed.  I don't think I got – what time did I come downstairs?  Do you remember what time I came downstairs?  It had to be – it had to be probably after 5 in the afternoon. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  It was after 5.  So they had been there –  Over three hours.  Yeah, over three hours.  And you made your appearance.  They had dinner.  Yeah, everybody ate already.  They ate.  They did presents.  Everything.  I wasn't at my own party.  Oh, my God.  I missed my party.  I came down.  Everybody was still, you know, hanging out, a little dessert, playing some games, doing things.  There he is.  When you walk down the steps.  Yeah.  It was like, oh, well, that –  Look who decided to – 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, look who decided.  I got that one.  Hey, where you been?  Oh, well, glad you could make it.  Yeah, welcome to the –  All right.  They're all doing –  Get out.  They're all doing their Ryan –  Get out.  They're all doing their Ryan Seacrest impressions, making believe they're –  Oh.  You know.  I swear to God, I'm not acknowledging what's happening in front of their eyes.  I wanted to unload on them like Dwight Yoakam in Sling Blade.  Get out of my house, retard. 
[00:25:00]  Retard.  Push the guy in the wheelchair into the door.  Amazing.  Oh, is he fantastic?  Yeah, so I was a-hurtin'.  And then, you know, the weird thing about a bad hangover is you have one beer and you  say to yourself, I really wasn't feeling that bad.  How could I have felt so bad?  You have to have the prescription beer, medicinal beer. 
[00:25:30]  The first sip is horrible.  But then, once you're done with the beer, you go, did I really feel that bad?  How many beers did you end up having, knowing you had this horrendous hangover going?  Oh, and then that night?  Going on, yeah.  You just keep going until, you know, you go back to sleep.  And then you wake up and feel better because, you know, I wasn't drinking wine.  That wine will knock you on your ass.  Drank a lot of it that night.  And then every other night was pretty much just, you know, beer or wine, drinking, having 
[00:26:00]  fun, but not really doing it.  I really didn't do anything.  I hung out at the house.  I played Call of Duty 5.  Nice.  I was watching a lot of TV, a lot of bad movies, things like that.  And then yesterday, my mother and Sal say, why don't you come over?  Dawn and Joseph are coming over with the kids.  And that's where we'll leave this.  Oh, well. 
[00:26:30]  You had a little problem getting back to your house last night.  No, getting to my mother and Sal.  Oh, two?  Whip, woo, whoop, woo.  Yeah, you know, you do the Sunday afternoon thing, go over there and see the kids.  What car did you take out?  I took the Escalade.  Nice.  Because, you know, with the weather the way it is and the salt on the roads and stuff,  I don't want to take the Mustang out.  So I took the Escalade, which isn't known as, you know, a race car.  Right.  And I usually don't, I drive over the speed limit with it, but not like I do with the Mustang. 
[00:27:00]  So I'm getting on to the expressway.  I have a very long on-ramp by my house to get on the expressway, which I like, because I am of the school of thought that if you're getting on a major highway, use the on-ramp to get up to highway speed.  Whenever I see somebody at the end of an on-ramp with their blinker on and their head hanging out the window with their elbow looking over their shoulder like, how did you fail? 
[00:27:30]  Right.  How did you fail the entire length of the on-ramp to fit in to traffic?  Right.  It amazes me.  And when I pass that car, I always look and go, ah, it figures, because it's always one of them.  Yeah.  And you know what I'm talking about.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  So I give her the gun, give it the gas, you know, wham, working the escalate up to highway speed. 
[00:28:00]  And I notice the back end of a police car.  It's not a Nassau County cop car.  It's not a sheriff's car.  But it is a police car.  So I see him.  He's in front of me.  I'm on the on-ramp.  I see he's on the expressway.  I'm on the on-ramp.  I'm coming on.  I get on.  I move into the middle lane. 
[00:28:30]  And I'm holding my speed, which is over the speed limit, but not crazy.  And I pass him.  I pass the officer.  This is a local town cop who I think has jurisdiction over about a mile of the expressway.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a local town cop, but he does have expressway jurisdiction.  Between, like, one exit.  Oh, my God.  I didn't have anything better to do?  Dude, well. 
[00:29:00]  So he gets right on my ass.  And now I'm, like, in that position where you go, ah, is he going to do this?  If you're going to just do it already, you know.  So it took a little while, but he hits me with the lights.  I pull right over.  It's the expressway.  So I pull over on the off-ramp and very close to the side.  I give him plenty of room.  Always give the guy plenty of room.  Some people pull over in the expressway and leave the cop hanging out in traffic. 
[00:29:30]  It just amazes me.  Now the guy's pissed, you know.  So I gave him plenty of room.  He comes out, and he just asked me for my paperwork to tell me what I did or anything.  Because I was, at this point, like, questioning.  I was, like, I didn't do anything.  He didn't get me on radar.  I wasn't going fast enough, long enough for him to tail me and get my speed.  And I had slowed down when he pulled up behind me.  I had slowed down to highway speed, which is why he got right on my ass like that again. 
[00:30:00]  So it was a mystery to me.  I'm, like, you know, usually when this happens, I'm sure I know why I'm being pulled over.  I'm doing 95 on radar.  So he comes back, and he goes, what are you doing?  I go, I was getting on the on-ramp, and I go, you know, you got one of those choices to make.  You either speed up to get past the car or you slow down to get behind him.  So I sped up, and I ended up in front of you, and then I slowed down to highway speed. 
[00:30:30]  He goes, you passed me doing about 70-something.  And I was, like, I knew I didn't.  I was in the 60s somewhere, but I didn't know I get the point.  And he said, when you were behind me, I go, look, I'll tell you, I'll be honest with you.  I said, a lot of people, when there's a cop behind them, have no clue what to do.  Do you slow down to the speed limit?  Do you speed up a little over the speed limit?  Do you get out of the way?  He goes, well, I'll tell you one thing you don't do.  You don't zip into another lane and pass me. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, snap.  Yeah, yeah, that was kind of a jab.  You don't like that.  What I did.  He was giving you the business.  He was.  And then he goes, I pulled you over before doing the same thing.  Of course he didn't.  And I go, I'm like Jesse James on the expressway.  I can't drive on this road.  I'm going to have to start taking the parkway and take my chances with the Stadies.  So he remembered you?  He remembered me.  He goes, you were in a red Ferrari. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, my God.  And you were in a different car.  And then he goes, you're going to tell me it was the same thing with the on-rep?  I go, I said, no, that was crazy.  I, like, agreed with him.  I said, no, that was crazy.  It was a Ferrari and everything.  So he hands me my stuff back.  And he goes, I'm not going to write you up because I just know your little cronies are going to get you out of it anyway.  And he called them cronies, threw my stuff in my lap, and walked away. 
[00:32:00]  I know your little cronies are going to get you out of it.  Well, it's like you always say, man, like they don't dare give you a ticket.  They know better.  Oh, no.  No, I never said that.  No, you were saying that in the office.  No, and I was very pretty.  This particular officer, you were calling a chump.  No, I said, thank you, sir.  Thank you, officer.  That's not what we heard, right, Jimmy?  I said, have a happy New Year, officer.  Thanks.  Nope.  I smiled.  I was very courteous because I'm always courteous to the police.  I know I'm doing wrong when I do wrong. 
[00:32:30]  This one was a little much.  Let me go to Jimmy.  We heard it differently.  We heard it differently.  Marginal call this one.  What did he actually say?  Anthony was like, he said the cop was cool.  He's like, the cop pulled me over.  It was courteous.  And he knew better, so he walked away.  And you were right.  I didn't say anyone knew better.  You were right.  I would never say that.  I count my blessings any time.  Something about, I dare you to give me a ticket.  Yeah.  We heard it.  No, I never say that.  You should, Anthony says one time, this is what he said. 
[00:33:00]  He didn't say it very specific, but if he said if they actually tried to write a ticket,  I would line my knuckles with PBA cards and punch their face and say, pick them.  No, I never said that either.  I was surprised you didn't talk like that.  I didn't even use a PBA card.  You didn't need to.  You know better.  You got cronies.  I got cronies.  My cronies.  Is it true you called him a rookie?  What a rookie?  No, I didn't call him a rookie.  I didn't.  If he's listening, I want to say, again, thank you for the courtesy that he gave me. 
[00:33:30]  Why are you winking as you say this?  I'm not winking.  I'm not.  Anthony doesn't even, like a lot of times you say, I don't even make eye contact with him.  Like when he has my PBA card, he cracks his window.  Like, you know how you flick a cigarette out the window?  That's how he holds the PBA card.  And they come and get it.  Doesn't even turn down his radio.  I tell him, you want to play 52 card pickup?  And then I go, yeah, with PBA cards.  Yes, with PBA cards.  That's right.  No. 
[00:34:00]  No, I don't do that.  And this one, I got to tell you, every other time I've been pulled over, I've agreed.  That I was completely in the wrong.  This time, it was a very marginal call that I don't really think I should have gotten pulled over for.  You do realize you shouldn't be saying this time.  What?  I get pulled over about once a month.  This is the first of 2009?  That was the first of 2009.  It was like, wow.  That was fast.  Four days in.  Can I go local? 
[00:34:30]  Can I go local?  Lake Success?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  It wasn't the Lake Success guys.  Those guys are badasses.  They drive chargers and they, wow.  You got to.  And they don't like it.  You drive through Lake Success.  So I can't drive through Lake Success.  I can't drive through Westbury.  Wait, why not?  Why can't you drive through Lake Success?  Because I drive too fast.  Like, I can't drive the way I want to drive.  I have to put on my cruise control.  Because I will go nuts.  If I'm behind somebody that's doing 60 and I see the middle lane is completely clear, I will go right into the middle lane and goose it and get past everybody. 
[00:35:00]  And that's when I get in trouble, when I'm passing people, which is most of the time.  So I have to set my cruise control and just sit back and grit my teeth and go, just, you're not in a hurry.  Just take it easy.  Don't go crazy.  And I have to do that through now Lake Success, Westbury, the 6th Precinct in Suffolk County, which now is all sheriffs out there. 
[00:35:30]  So I think I'm kind of in the clear.  Who knows this?  Because I've been pulled over by every single one of them.  The guys all know me now.  They got, yes.  One foot on the brake and one on the gas.  Hey.  Basically, you're telling everybody out there that you have to be a regular Joe through three towns on Long Island.  I pretty much got, not a regular Joe, I get passed by a lot of people.  And it annoys me.  You know? 
[00:36:00]  One foot on the brake, one on the gas.  I can't drive 55.  You tell him, Sammy.  Oh, it's just horrendous.  He can't drive 55, Jim.  Oh, my God.  There's too much traffic.  I can't pass.  It drives me crazy.  This is the song that's going through my head when I'm driving.  What's this, 83 or something?  Yeah.  Somewhere around there.  Some awful year.  It's black and white. 
[00:36:30]  Cuts the groove again.  And then I sing.  You don't like this, Jimmy?  Take my license.  All that jive.  I can't drive 55.  See, he can't drive 55.  Cool.  Yeah.  What else rhymes?  I drink five alive.  I enjoy Burl Ives. 
[00:37:00]  This is terrible.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  And tells himself you'll still be filthy rich even if it takes you an extra ten minutes to get there.  Oh, is that what I do?  Tells himself.  Maybe he tells him.  That's what I have to do when I drive.  Yeah.  Like this morning, I hit a wall of traffic.  Oh, boy.  And I started getting a little antsy.  Up on the curb?  What did you do?  No, no, no.  This is expressway driving.  It's four, you know, whatever, five in the morning, whatever it is. 
[00:37:30]  Sure.  And I get antsy, like, why are you in the left lane and not doing 70 at this hour?  You're doing 60, and you're not passing the people next to you.  So it gets me kind of crazy, and I start looking for openings.  I start looking ahead for openings.  And when I find one, I take it, and I just hammer down and get past the entire thing.  And then I look at my rearview mirror and just see this big block of headlights and go, what are they doing? 
[00:38:00]  Why aren't they in a hurry to get anywhere?  One guy had his hazard lights on in the left lane.  If you've got a problem that you've got to turn your hazards on, you better be on the shoulder or the right lane.  Sure.  This guy was in the left lane with his hazards on.  I had to pull next to him in the middle lane and just look at him until he finally looked at me,  and I saw something from some faraway land that didn't understand the concept of turn off your hazards.  It negates your blinkers, first of all. 
[00:38:30]  It makes your blinkers useless, and people, you're in the left lane.  That's not the, what country are you in?  Oh, it's annoying.  No wonder I get pulled over all the time.  People annoy me on the road.  I get genuinely annoyed.  So in driving home, I set the cruise control.  Very good.  Because that's what I do.  I don't, I've been pulled over for speeding every time I'm pulled over. 
[00:39:00]  Every time I get pulled over, it's for speeding.  It's not for an illegal lane change.  It's not for not using my blinkers.  It's not for equipment violations.  It's always for speeding.  So if I want to put the odds down of me getting pulled over, I set the old cruise, stay in the right or middle lane, keep her between the lines, drive like a good boy.  You're thinking.  But I've always done that.  It's when I'm driving to where I'm going. 
[00:39:30]  That's the problem.  Well.  That's when I'm not thinking.  Basically, I get what you're saying.  Yeah, exactly.  There's something going on.  Well.  At your destination.  Could be.  Hey, man, you want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man.  The police got my car.  What do you mean the police got your car?  Just what I said.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  You stupid ass.  The police got my car.  Dude, I can't believe the police got your car. 
[00:40:00]  Ah, shut up, man.  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  Well, I was driving home from the bar.  Dude, that really sucks.  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  The police got my car.  Well, I was driving drunk from the bar.  Son of a bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas. 
[00:40:30]  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas.  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  So I can go drink at the bar.  Son of a bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas.  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  So I can go get drunk at the bar.  Police got my car.  Police got my car. 
[00:41:00]  Police got my car.  Well, I was driving, getting stoned in South Central.  Dude, that don't rhyme.  Shut up, man.  Police got my car.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  Police got my car.  Well, I was driving home, drunk from the bar.  You got a tee-wee, man.  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas.  I told my bitch I'd have my Chevy for Christmas.  So we could get drunk at the bar. 
[00:41:30]  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  You stupid dick, man.  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas.  Shut up, bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  So we could go get drunk at the bar.  Calm down, man.  Ah, shut up, man.  I guess I said a few things I shouldn't have.  Bonus?  How did you get a bonus?  I cut out bonuses this year.  Yeah, and thanks for telling us.  I've gotten a Christmas bonus every year but this one.  You don't want to get bonuses, fine. 
[00:42:00]  But when people count on them as part of their salary, what you did just plain...  Sucks.  Thank you, Russ.  Old St. Nick's got bourbon breath.  It's so cold you could catch your death.  A cop sold me some crystal meth.  It's a merry fuckin' Christmas.  Everything's so Christmassy.  The streets are twinkling with frozen pee.  My priest just sat on Santa's knee.  It's a merry fuckin' Christmas.  All the kids go to bed each night to dream what Santa brings or brings. 
[00:42:30]  Unless they're Jewish or Muslim or some other chip religion.  Crappy toys flyin' off the shelves.  Midgets dressed up to look like elves.  Spread good cheer or burn in hell.  It's a merry fuckin' Christmas.  All the kids go to bed each night to dream what Santa brings them. 
[00:43:00]  Unless they're Jewish or Muslim or some other chip religion.  Cracklin' fires to keep me warm.  And my collection of Asian porn.  Cradle my bells and work my horn.  And it's a keep on truckin'.  Last you're suckin'.  Midget chuckin'.  Slap the puckin'.  How much work could I would check checkin'?  Merry thoggin' Christmas. 
[00:43:30]  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Shut up.  Hey, this is Dennis Leary listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Another thing, and we've talked about this a million times.  So I go to see Juno, you know, because the girl wanted to see it.  And I'm glad I went.  It was a really good movie.  This was one she had her eye on, right?  And we were bored.  It was Sunday, I guess.  And it was like 1 o'clock in the afternoon.  I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, how many people would go see Juno?  Sunday, 1 o'clock. 
[00:44:00]  We get to the movie theater.  There's a line out the door.  So we go to the convenient ATM ticket machine.  Oh, yeah.  Why would you ever wait on a line for a movie ticket when you just throw your credit card in and you get two tickets in a second?  Spits out your tickets.  I don't know if every theater has this yet, but they have them here in Manhattan at a few places.  And everyone was going to see Juno.  And it's my biggest pet peeve.  I don't go to the movies, you know, and sit in these fucking crowded theaters.  It drives me nuts.  And we squish in, like, all the way next to the wall.  The theater is packed, and I'm sitting there like, why in the year 2007, because it was still 2007, I'm like, why in the year 2007 do we have to fucking sit in movie theaters still? 
[00:44:30]  I can't comprehend this.  Especially there's a market out there where you throw it on, you know, the cable and say you could watch Juno for $20, $30.  There's a market out there.  People would pay $30 fucking to see a brand new movie instead of sitting in a crowded theater. 
[00:45:00]  I'm like, why are we still sitting in crowded theaters?  The whole systems are way better than anything they, you know, they show you in theaters, except for IMAX or IMAX, whatever the fuck they call it.  I always get that wrong.  IMAX.  IMAX.  I think because...  But it looks dated.  The movie sounds dated.  The sound isn't as good as you could get in most systems that most people have now.  It's not that expensive to have a nice little system in your home with the flat screen TVs and the high def and the, you know, digital and all that. 
[00:45:30]  It's like, why are we still sitting in fucking movie theaters?  Don't tell me.  The old movie house.  And then I'm trying to, like, logically think about this.  I'm like, is it for the experience of watching a movie with others?  It's like, no.  With people you don't like.  These people suck, and I'm sure they think I suck.  It's part of it's because they can charge per person there.  It's just a simple dollars and cents.  Even if they charge 30 bucks at home, a lot of people wouldn't get it because they would just be watching with their wives.  They couldn't afford it.  And the ones that could would get fucking 10 or 15 people in there or a bunch of people to watch it. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  And they would tape it, and there'd be no DVD market.  Yeah, it's probably the piracy issue also.  And then Miss Selfish behind me had to take her flu to the crowded movie theater.  And I'm trying to be better.  I really am.  As much as I tell these crazy stories on the air, I really am trying to be better.  I, once again, had to bite myself because I want to turn around and go, why are you coming to a movie theater if you have the fucking flu? 
[00:46:30]  Yep.  Coughing and sneezing the entire time.  Well, now I go like this.  I put my shirt up, hoping this is going to stop some of the germs.  Yeah, I don't understand.  I decide to play a fucking bank robber in the middle of the movie.  Yeah, I don't think that works.  And then I'm like slumping down in my seat like this going, well, maybe the cough will fly over my head.  Fly over your head, yeah.  Get the person in front of me.  Show them.  Why do you have to be that selfish?  I know people have to go out about, you know.  Not when they're sick?  No.  Not to the movies.  Stay home.  Not to the movies.  Maybe your job, you don't have a choice, whatever. 
[00:47:00]  But like a movie theater?  Come on.  What the fuck?  Keep your outbreak at home.  What the fuck?  The germ-filled messes.  But they are starting to throw some movies on DirecTV or whatever.  What is it called?  Pay-per-view?  On Demand.  Thank you, Than.  On Demand.  On Demand.  But they're basic like IFC crap movies.  Every once in a while they'll pop one on and say you can get this before it hits theaters.  But it's never something you want to see yet. 
[00:47:30]  Something new that I think they started on Cablevision out there.  You can go through the little menu and there's DVDs and you can buy it right there and watch it immediately and then they send you the DVD.  Like if you have a movie you want to buy and own it.  Really?  You can watch it and then they send you the DVD.  Wow, that's great.  Where's this at?  A Cablevision.  Oh, okay.  But they're also going to...  Oh, my God.  Was it Apple or iTunes? 
[00:48:00]  I was reading over the...  Did a lot of reading over the break.  I did.  Where they're saying that you're going to be able to download movies now.  Yeah.  But they're going to go away.  Like you get it for...  You've only watched them for so long.  You get it for a certain amount of time.  Self-destruct.  Which that technology is just amazing.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  But then can't we take our nice high-def fucking video cameras and really get a nice copy before it goes away?  Get a bootleg copy.  Just videotape your screen.  Videotape your screen perfectly, though.  Right?  Think about it.  You could set up something nice to get around that. 
[00:48:30]  A little bootleg copy.  But that idea is even better.  So you get the DVD.  Mm-hmm.  It's sent to you in the mail.  Yeah.  Well, that's probably the iTunes way.  It will protect the DVD market.  I mean, that's probably how they...  It's brilliant how they're always trying to stay one step ahead of...  On Demand sucks a big fucking piss hard on.  It's better than not having it.  I'll tell you why.  And people are going to laugh, but whatever.  But they can relate in their own way.  I didn't hear Jimmy's side.  That's right.  I'll hear it during the replay.  That's a stupid dick joke I made. 
[00:49:00]  I was getting into the Christmas spirit, and I'm like, you know what?  I don't have a lot of Christmas movies.  I have, like, the typical one, like, Christmas Vacation, and I have, like, Elf.  Caligula.  Yeah.  Downfall.  Right.  Right.  But I don't have, like, I was actually looking for, like, Bad Santa and a couple of these others that I haven't really seen.  I'm in the mood.  I'm like, I got a Christmas tree.  It's getting close here, right?  So I go, you know what?  On Demand, they must have Christmas movies. 
[00:49:30]  It's the Christmas season.  Yeah.  Couldn't find one, bro.  Maybe one.  But there's a reason why they don't have them on demand during the holiday season.  What is that?  They didn't make a deal with the, because they know people are going to go out to stores and buy those movies?  Oh, so you buy them instead of just rent them.  Why wouldn't they have a ton of Christmas movies on demand around the holiday season?  Why?  To get into our pocketbooks.  Yep.  Our purse strings.  Our purse strings.  Well, what is the real reason about that?  Because they want you to go to Best Buy and actually buy the movie, you think? 
[00:50:00]  I'm thinking so, yeah.  It was unbelievable.  You probably just, yeah, they probably, like, you know, everyone would just watch them.  When you buy, especially a seasonal movie, you're going to buy it and only watch it then.  Who wants to watch a Christmas movie?  Like, Christmas with the crunks.  That fucking horse shit was called.  In July.  I know where you're going.  So the only time that people are going to buy it is then.  But you can watch it on demand.  Plus, you'll watch eight minutes and realize, wow, this movie fucking eats an ass. 
[00:50:30]  And you'll turn it off.  Wow, what's that one where the dad gets all tangled up in the lights?  By the way, I finally watched Spider-Man 3.  How was it?  That was good.  I totally went into the dark Spider-Man character.  And he was emo?  Yeah, I heard that.  Oh, my God.  Dude, chills.  What's his name there?  Crap.  Olsen had, like, the emo haircut.  And he had the dark eyes.  And he's, like, kind of walking down the streets of, quote, Manhattan.  And he's, like, pointing at chicks and stuff like he's uber cool. 
[00:51:00]  It was a douche chill moment in that movie.  Not believable.  And just didn't work.  Who's Tobey Maguire?  Yeah, Tobey Maguire.  Yes, of course.  It didn't work.  And they were going, I guess they were trying to get into the emo movement or something to get these people watching.  I don't know what the fuck they were going for, but it was embarrassing to watch.  The rest of the movie was pretty cool, but that whole thing was stupid.  How is the Sandy character?  The one who's full of sand?  That sandy creature man? 
[00:51:30]  Who was he?  We had him on the show.  He didn't church.  Oh, yeah.  Thomas Hayden Church, yes.  Oh, yeah, okay.  He did have him on.  I'm like, holy shit, this guy is rocking, man.  I forgot who we have on the show all the time.  What, they beat him with a fucking vacuum cleaner?  How hard is it to beat a guy made of sand?  Suckers.  Yeah.  What a shitty villain.  It's Wind Man.  You open the window, he goes.  Yeah, it's kind of weird because, like, his sand would just kind of, like, blow around the streets 
[00:52:00]  and then become, like, hard when he needed it, but then you could, like, yeah, it was kind  of a dumb concept.  Fucking awful.  But he did pretty well with the character.  Put a cat turd on him and embarrass him.  He's got a little hat.  Put him in a litter box, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's trying to destroy the world and there's a fucking cat shitting all over his  fucking back and stomach.  But Tobey Maguire in that emo, dark, fucking Spider-Man thing was really bizarre.  Yeah, a lot of people didn't like that.  Oh, they saw him way behind. 
[00:52:30]  I'm way behind.  That's a whole thing that people hated.  All right.  Were they doing Spider-Man 4?  I'm sure.  Oh, yeah, that franchise is still alive and well.  I'm sure.  What was the, like, best thing you got for Christmas?  Did you get anything good?  Yeah, I got something that most people would be like, whatever, but he was a hero of mine  growing up and my girl got me.  A coincidence.  That's kind of what I got.  Oh, really?  Something having to do with a hero of mine.  My best Christmas present, besides the bizarre yoga sweatpants, with the huge cummerbund. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  I mean, if you want to pull these sweatpants down a little bit to look cool, they would  still be above your navel.  Oh, God.  Looking cool at the gym.  Oh, my God.  Well, anyway, what was the coolest thing?  Oh, I got Taxi.  What season?  Because season four will not come out. 
[00:53:30]  I'm so irritated.  Oh, all right.  I got the first three, then.  Yeah, I got all three seasons of Taxi that I'm going to jump into.  I got, believe it or not, I never got this officially, Nirvana Unplugged DVD.  Alice in Chains Unplugged DVD, which I already had, so I'm going to pass that along to somebody.  I got the Ken Burns documentary of New York City, which is really interesting, and some  clothes, and a nose trimmer thing. 
[00:54:00]  I think she's giving me a hint.  I think she's basically saying, you know, if you fucking trim those bad boys, you won't  pick your nose as much.  It feels like you got a porcupine in your nose for a week.  Eat that, you're sneezing.  Dude, I was driving home from Long Island yesterday, and I was picking my nose in the  car, and my girl turns to me and goes, what are you doing?  I go, I'm picking my nose, and I was trying to get away with that.  Thanks for announcing it. 
[00:54:30]  Is she calling you out on it?  You saw that I was picking my nose.  You could have looked out the window and just let me be, but you had to say it.  Now we both know I was picking my nose.  Well, let's play devil's advocate.  Look, I haven't got the batteries yet for the nose trimmer, but now I'm going to nose  trim up, and I'm going to pick less.  Pick less?  Do you understand that...  Well, you can't completely stop the habit of picking.  Do you understand that she's a really attractive girl? 
[00:55:00]  Here it goes.  Some would say a 10, and others would agree.  Absolutely.  A knockout.  Yeah.  Smart.  Great look.  Everything.  Funny.  Very funny.  Oh, yeah, boy, she nailed me and my stupid girlfriend.  We were sitting there with our fucking hats on, our New Year's Eve hat.  She goes, Jim, get closer.  I want to take a picture of you and the other idiot in the hat.  She really fucking knows.  Oh, damn.  Oh, we laughed.  Can you bring in your New Year's Eve pictures? 
[00:55:30]  Sure.  We've got to get them on a website.  Okay.  The ones I got of you, and then they were trying to take pictures of Jimmy and I, and I had  my noisemaker.  Jimmy had his ridiculous hat, and I have the stupidest blowing of the noisemaker ever.  We have the worst pictures.  Yeah, I'll bring them, and I got my new MySpace photo.  My girl took a picture of me eating, but I wasn't trying to be funny, and my mouth was  open, and I had a hat on, and I'm just a fat-necked cunt with food in my mouth.  It was really funny.  But anyway, where were we at? 
[00:56:00]  Nose picking.  Okay, yeah.  She busted you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then you said you got the nose trimmer, so you'll pick less.  Oh, yeah.  Hopefully.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where were we?  I just want to say-  Oh, my best gift.  Oh, you're your best gift.  Yes.  And then the only reason I'm interrupting, because then you trumped me, obviously, and  that's what we did.  No, no, I have to thank.  Which is fine, but listen.  Somebody for my great gift.  One of my heroes growing up was Pete Maravich, and I went to his basketball camp. 
[00:56:30]  I met him.  I got his autograph and stuff, but Lindsey got me a canceled check.  Pete Maravich canceled check.  Nice.  And I don't collect memorabilia for the most part, but this is something that's like,  wow, this is really cool.  Brings me back to my childhood, blah, blah, blah.  I was big time into basketball with a picture.  It's really nice.  That was my best gift.  What was it, too?  What was the check written out, too?  I haven't seen it yet, because it was sent to Philly, and the Philly crew has it right 
[00:57:00]  now, because fuckers, you know, didn't deliver it in time for Christmas.  Bastards.  But they finally have it down there, and they're setting it up, so.  And I'm sure it's not a fake.  No, why wouldn't it?  I mean, remember, people, it's like that one time I saw the Babe Ruth autographed baseball  in the blue marker that they, I'm sure, were selling in 1917.  Never get ripped off by and there.  Wow.  She should have called me when I talked to her.  He spells it wrong.  You know what?  Maveridge with two Vs.  I got you beat. 
[00:57:30]  I got a Babe Ruth autograph on an aluminum bat.  Ah.  Huh?  That's good.  Hey.  One of a kind.  Anthony really got something cool, though.  No, I did.  I did.  My part was just to set up for Anthony.  See, what Anthony just did there was he actually asked me a question, like, make him believe  he actually cares about me and my life, which he doesn't.  It's time to acknowledge that in my way.  No, I wanted to know if you got something good.  I think you wanted to know.  He was curious.  I really did.  No, you didn't.  I really did.  Because you knew what you were going to trump me with. 
[00:58:00]  No, no, no trumping.  I was just very excited about it.  You never asked me a question about how I'm doing.  Never.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  What did you get, Anthony?  I'd like to know.  Well, one thing I got that was just wonderful is it's a big, big, thick book.  It's called Hitler and His Generals.  And it's transcriptions of all the talks between Hitler and his generals in the war room.  And it's just a day-by-day account of the war in all their own words because Hitler insisted 
[00:58:30]  on getting stenographers in there after a while because he kept getting his generals saying,  like, well, no, I wasn't clear that you meant this or said that.  So he went, all right, I'm getting stenographers.  Every word that's ever said is going to be written down now.  So it's just some stuff is just really simple, nothing.  And other is like major battle planning.  But some of the things, you think Hitler was involved in doing things. 
[00:59:00]  There was one thing that was written, and a couple of his generals are saying that they  have the panzers ready, but they need fuel.  And Hitler just says, so without the fuel, the panzers will not run.  And you read this and just go, this guy's an idiot.  Jesus Christ.  He's making a proclamation.  So what you're saying here, but then Buddy and Jen out in Colorado. 
[00:59:30]  Can I stop you for a second, though?  Yes.  Would you actually read something like that?  I have been.  It's amazing.  Will you go cover to cover on something like that, or you just kind of browse it a little  bit?  Occasionally, I'll probably skim a couple of pages.  But for the most part, yeah, maybe a couple.  Like, I'll look and see what they're talking about.  Whenever I see something about a final solution, I don't know.  You got to see what that guy was thinking when it comes to that.  You're all in.  I'm all in. 
[01:00:00]  But anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  That's very interesting.  Go ahead.  And then Buddy and Jen got me probably one of the best gifts ever.  What?  It's a 1938 German Mauser.  Jesus.  The, yes.  The gun.  Yes, the rifle of the German soldier.  And God knows what this thing did.  It's got a couple of, let's say, unique markings on it.  It's, you know, a couple of stamp marks on the bottom of the barrel. 
[01:00:30]  How many dents?  A little eagle and swastika that he's sitting on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How many dents?  Oh, I was looking at the back end of this thing.  The front end, you know, is usually the business end.  Oh, the back end of this thing, just a big hunk of metal on the butt that you know was just  used to crack noses open with.  Wow.  But very, very cool.  Very excited.  Does it still work?  Yeah.  Fully working.  Can you actually go down to the range and shoot that off? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Really?  That's your next video.  It's amazing.  Now I just got to get whatever the Japs were using back then.  What the hell were they using?  Small condoms.  And then I'll have my World War II.  And then some kind of Soviet piece of crap.  Weren't they known for having the blades on the end of their guns?  The bayonets?  I call it the little blades.  They all do.  Yeah, they all got it.  Didn't they start that thing?  And the Mausers got the bayonet attachment and stuff. 
[01:01:30]  That hand-to-hand shit back then.  Pretty cool.  Scary monsters.  All right.  But then in my office, I'm going to have a wall dedicated to World War II rifles.  How great is that?  Do you have any American?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, of course.  You've got to have that.  I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East.  No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus.  They have different religious beliefs.  They believe in Muhammad and not in our holiday. 
[01:02:00]  And so every December, I go to the Middle East and say.  Hey there, Mr. Muslim.  Merry fucking Christmas.  Put down that book, the Koran, and here's some holiday wishes.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fucking celebrate.  There is no holiday season in India, I've heard.  They don't hang up their stockings and that is just absurd. 
[01:02:30]  They never read a Christmas story.  They don't know what Rudolph is about.  And that is why in December, I'll go to India and shout.  Hey there, Mr. Hinduist.  Merry fucking Christmas.  Drink eggnog and eat some beef and pass it to the missus.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fucking celebrate.  Now I heard that in Japan, everyone just lives in sin. 
[01:03:00]  They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.  On December 25th, all they do is eat a cake.  And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and try.  Hi there, Mr. Shintoist.  Merry fucking Christmas.  God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.  In case you haven't noticed, there's best of things to do.  So let's all rejoice for Jesus.  Merry fucking Christmas to you.  On Christmas Day, I travel around the world and say. 
[01:03:30]  Now it's Christmas bonus and all you atheists too.  Merry fucking Christmas to you.  It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas.  My friends won't let me join in any games.  And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree. 
[01:04:00]  Or leave water out for Rudolph cause there's something wrong with me.  My people don't believe in Jesus Christ divinity.  Hanukkah is nice, but why is it that Santa passes over my house every year? 
[01:04:30]  And instead of eating ham, I have to eat kosher lottees.  Instead of Silent Night, I'm singing hu-hah, don't capisce.  And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles?  Tell me, please.  Hey, little boy, I couldn't help but hear. 
[01:05:00]  You're feeling left out of Christmas cheer.  But I've come to say that you shouldn't be said.  This is the one month that you should be glad.  Because it's nice to be a Jew on Christmas. 
[01:05:30]  You don't have to deal with the season at all.  You have to be on your best behavior or give to charity.  You don't have to go to grandma's house with your alcoholic family.  And I don't have to sit on Sunday, Santa's clap, and have him breathe a stinky breath on me.  That's right, you're a Jew.  A styling Jew. 
[01:06:00]  It's a good time to be Hebrew on Christmas.  Christmas.  On Christmas.  Sounds like a Nazi march. 
[01:06:30]  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  Kick-off-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-dack-d 
[01:07:00]  Ah, yes, Anthony.  Freedom.  Yes.  It's the O&H show.  All right, should we get stalker Patty in here? 
[01:07:30]  She wants to give us her Christmas gift, Anthony.  Patty coming in.  She worked very hard on her Christmas gift to Aunt Nye.  Of course, a lot of thought went into this.  It's always the thought that counts.  We hear that growing up, right?  Right.  Wrong.  And she doesn't have much money, so she worked hard at getting us a Christmas gift that you  and I can both enjoy.  Do we have some Christmas music for this moment?  I think we should have something like that.  It shouldn't just be come in. 
[01:08:00]  It should set the whole mood.  Now, this is a woman that, like Opie said, she's in some hard times right now.  You know, the money isn't there, and she's been forced to move out right around the holidays,  which is a hard thing to do.  Finally, somebody came through and has offered her a place to stay, at least temporarily,  but that thing, that weight is still on her shoulders that she's going to have to find a place to live.  And now, even with all this going on, and without the money, she has taken some time out to put together a Christmas gift for us. 
[01:08:30]  And that, I believe, is the true spirit of Christmas, Opie.  And I found the perfect Christmas song for Patty.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It's a Sandy Cain Christmas. 
[01:09:00]  All right, we need something a little more saggy.  Oh.  Come on, I thought that was funny.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, come on.  All right, let me see what else I can play for good old, good old Stark of Patty. 
[01:09:30]  Could we get some sappy Christmas music?  Because Patty's coming in with her Christmas gift for us, and I can't find anything good.  Oh, come, all ye faithful.  Oh, baby.  Now we're having fun.  All right, that one doesn't work either.  No.  We need something very, you know, something that captures the spirit of what this is all about. 
[01:10:00]  Because like I said, this is the true meaning of Christmas.  All right, ready?  Yeah, let's let Stalker Patty in.  What is this?  Is this Christmas?  Yeah.  Let her in.  It sounds like a Celine Dion Christmas song.  Yes.  Bye.  Silent night. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, oh, oh, yeah.  Are you real?  Oh, it's good.  Ah!  Eh, eh, eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Eh, eh.  Eh.  Eh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  This is very appropriate.  Patty, how are you?  I'm fine. 
[01:11:00]  How are you?  Very good.  I was just commenting.  Almost brought a tear to my eye.  The true spirit of Christmas.  You look like two miles of bad road.  Coming, coming in and making gifts for us, even though you're on some tough times now and trying to find a new place to live during the holidays.  Very tough.  And now, uh, bringing us, making us presents because she's a little, a little short.  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mish. 
[01:11:30]  Right, foggy.  So, uh, Patty?  Yeah?  What did you, uh, bring us?  Uh, show Anthony first.  Oh, no, if that, you better bring it to Opie so he can unwrap it.  Oh, show, show Anthony first.  All right, show me.  All right, I want to see it second.  Oh, no, dude.  I can't allow it.  She's just being funny.  Let me see.  Oh, is it?  Look at that.  She made a, uh, a commemorative, uh, framed, uh, Xeroxed copy of the cover of the Penthouse magazine. 
[01:12:00]  With the release date and with paint.  With the day that it came out.  Patty, you couldn't spring for the $8.99 for the real cover?  Well, she is, she is poor.  Couldn't you have cut the real cover off?  No, I wouldn't.  Patty, what's going on with your lips?  Did you eat a candy bar before you come in?  Hey, what happened?  You got chapped lips? 
[01:12:30]  You got some chapped lips, right?  I thought it was chocolate.  I'm sorry.  No, she got chapped lips.  It's that time of year.  It's very cold.  It's all right, Patty.  You know me.  I get the swamp lip, too.  I know.  Very strange.  You got in the exact same place as me.  All right.  So, well, that is wonderful.  We will hang this up in the office.  Thank you.  With all the other things.  Yeah, it was an important magazine article. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  It was a turning point in our career, I believe, Patty.  And I'm just wondering, you couldn't get the real cover, huh?  I didn't want to take you off the magazine.  Some of the detail kind of gets washed out with the Xerox, but the black and white's kind  of cool.  And it's the thought that counts.  Right.  And when am I going to get to see the lovely Christmas?  Oh, but you could see it later in the office or something, after the show.  Why?  I'm just going to hold this right here next to me for a while. 
[01:13:30]  I want to see it right now.  Let him see it.  No, Patty.  Maybe.  Why can't I see it?  Maybe we'll just leave it here, because it's nice and everything.  And he can see there.  Look.  I can't really see.  You can see it.  I know I have really good eyes now.  You got the good Dr. Philotov fixed eyes.  Look.  See?  Come on, Ann.  Why can't I see it?  There it is.  I'll hold it closer.  Look.  On top, she used, what's that?  A glue gun?  Paint crayons.  Paint crayons.  How long did it take you to put this together? 
[01:14:00]  30 seconds?  About half an hour to do a trip to the mall and 48 hours to dry.  To dry, because she says, it says Opie, Splotch, Anthony.  Oh, that's your hand.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then on the bottom it says November 28, 2000.  That's the release date.  That's the date that the article came out.  Very nice.  And it's in some kind of a, looks like you took a glue gun, it looks like, and colored  it.  It looks like you're very crafty, Patty.  You do a lot of crafts, Patty? 
[01:14:30]  Sure.  Yeah?  Can I?  It's nice.  No.  I think we ought to just.  Opie.  What?  Opie, let's just wait later on.  No, can I?  Later on in the office.  Can I see it?  You can see it.  And then we can both pick a good place in the office that we want to hang it up.  I'm thinking maybe next to Hot Shannon's body mold.  But I want to enjoy Patty's gift.  Or near the front of her.  You can enjoy it right here when it's in my hands.  Okay?  I can't really see.  The lighting isn't good in the studio.  Let me just make something clear to you right now. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  If I hand this over to you.  Right.  So you can enjoy it.  Right.  I'm leaving the studio.  Because I, for one, cannot sit here.  I just want to enjoy the Christmas gift from Stalker Patty.  This is something I cannot be party to.  What are you talking about?  I just can't.  You don't want to, you don't want to, you know, join me in the joy of Christmas?  I just had fish and stuff a bubble gum machine. 
[01:15:30]  No, Patty.  This is too nice.  She took time out.  God damn, you're a pussy.  In her house.  Where'd you do this?  In your apartment that you're being kicked out of?  Will be kicked out of?  And, and, and you, you went out, you bought the materials for it.  How much did all this, and I hate to do this because it is a gift, but, you know, you probably  could have used the money that you, you used on this for something, right, that you're  doing right now?  Give me the goddamn gift, you pussy. 
[01:16:00]  Every dollar is very important to you right now, right, Patty?  Give me the gift, you pussy.  So, Ovi, I'm going to keep this right here.  Next to me, and in the office, we'll hang it up, because I think it's very nice, Patty.  The Christmas gift from Stark and Patty.  Patty, thank you very much, because it's very nice.  Can I at least hold it?  You know what?  I will give this to Patty.  So, if she wants to let you see it, that's fine. 
[01:16:30]  Okay, Patty?  Why is everyone putting their head down?  Patty now has it.  Now you can show it to Ovi.  And she's holding it up and showing it to Ovi.  Hey, I'm squinting for the first time since I got my new eyes.  I can't imagine you squinting with 2015.  Ah, there you go.  See?  She's holding it a little closer.  A little closer.  It's right there in front of Ovi, where Patty is holding it very closely.  Why?  Just reach over a little further.  I just keep thinking of bubble gum machines. 
[01:17:00]  Bubble gum machines.  Yeah.  And I just couldn't see that happening.  No.  No.  Why is Adolf Hitler checking in on the instant feedback?  Adolf Hitler's checking in already?  Patty, can I see it again?  Like, if you get it a little closer to me, I'll be able to read what you wrote with your  glue gun.  Ovi, sit.  Good.  Stay.  Good.  Good.  Just a little closer.  No, you're going to...  Oh, a little closer. 
[01:17:30]  Come on.  People saying they're curled up in the corners of their house.  Come on.  I'm like a goddamn crack addict right now.  You are.  And someone's dangling a rock right in front of me.  Can I just see a pattern?  Yeah.  Go over and talk to Ovi by the cart rack over there.  I can't understand why I can't enjoy a Christmas gift.  Yeah, but you're going to do something. 
[01:18:00]  I wouldn't do anything.  Oh.  Oh.  I wouldn't do anything.  Looks like you put a lot of work into it.  It does.  Right.  You know.  Why is there a camera in here?  Right?  Right?  Put a lot of work into that.  A lot of your heart into it, and it's Christmas time, Opie.  Carmine, what's up?  What's up?  Yo, please don't give Opie the picture.  Why?  Please don't. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Thank you.  Opie, you know what you're going to do.  I ain't doing anything.  I know, too, because I was...  Tom, what's going on?  Opie, you twisted ass.  Don't touch that thing.  Don't let him have it.  I'm sweating real bad, man.  Get away.  They have the bushes.  I'm sweating real bad, man.  I'm really...  I'm twitching.  Please.  Can I...  Could you just, like, reach over the console a little further?  Why?  I'm going to see it eventually. 
[01:19:00]  If you smash it, you'll break my little heart.  Oh!  Does that have hair on it, too?  Oh, it's a joke, see?  I like joking.  Bernie, what's going on?  Opie, no, please.  What?  Come on.  I just want to see my gift.  This woman's gone through a lot in the last month.  You got to give her a break, man.  I just want to feel my gift.  That's all.  Good luck with Opie. 
[01:19:30]  This is my first gift of the season.  Mike, what's going on?  Oh, I'm cringing.  I keep turning the radio off and then back on.  Why?  Man.  You guys are horrible.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Can I see the gift?  Just a little closer.  Holding it up.  Look, look.  I'm almost there.  I don't trust you, Opie.  She's just showing it to you from a distance. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, I know you well enough.  Can I just see it?  Rick, go get the gift.  Oh, no, no, no.  Ben, Ben.  Oh, no.  Ben's going to pry it from her hands.  Her cold hands.  Oh, no.  I can't.  I can't watch this.  Give it to me.  Oh.  Where are you going, man?  I can't be party to this.  Stink, wouldn't you like to see the gift from Stalker Patty? 
[01:20:30]  Maybe I ought to just hold on to it a little while.  And Opie's appreciating it, I think.  Stinky is.  You're appreciating our gifts?  Stinky is trustworthy, Patty.  Let Stinky have the thing.  I don't trust Ben, and I don't trust Rick.  You don't trust people?  No.  No.  Just give it to Stinky, so he can look at it.  Oh, Stinky has it in his hands.  And I know what Opie's going to do, because I sweat the hammer. 
[01:21:00]  Stinky, you have it.  Mm-hmm.  Now, Stinky, you can hold on to it.  You know that raise you want?  Oh, yes.  Stinky.  Very funny Opie.  Stinky.  Yeah, that sounds good.  No.  What do I have to do?  Just give it to me.  No.  No, no, no, no.  No, Stinky, there's no.  You don't have to do it.  This isn't about money or anything.  This is about emotions and stuff. 
[01:21:30]  And Christmas.  You worked real hard this year.  Christmas.  I know you want that raise there.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, no, no.  It's about Christmas and stuff.  That was very well.  Come on.  You need a couple of bucks?  Just walk around here.  I'll give you some cash right now.  Oh, no.  You said this stuff before.  Oh, yeah.  On Ron and Fez's show.  Just walk around the console.  All right.  No.  Oh, Stinky.  I know what he's going to do.  No, Patty.  I can't.  No.  I can't possibly see him doing this.  He wants to have his fun. 
[01:22:00]  No, no.  That's not right.  Throw it.  Throw it.  No, no.  Oh, they're playing keep away.  They're trying to get it over Rick's head.  Oh, no.  Opie's down.  Opie went down.  Rick took him out.  Oh, Stinky still has the picture.  Wow, he's doing good.  He's trying to get it to Opie, but Rick is playing the middleman.  Rick's showing some compassion.  Yeah, Stinky.  Give it to him.  Stinky having a hard time to get it.  Let him have it.  Oh, no.  I know what he's going to do.  No, Patty. 
[01:22:30]  I can't see him doing that.  I wasn't born yesterday or the day before either.  I wouldn't go that far.  I know him.  All right, Patty.  Thank you.  Oh, look at that.  There you go.  Wow, Stinky couldn't get it to Opie.  Back to death.  Good job, Rick.  I have the picture back in my possession, Opie.  Look.  See?  All right.  Well, thank you, Patty.  I really don't think.  You know, wait a minute.  This isn't nice of me not trusting my on-air partner. 
[01:23:00]  Right.  Tell you the truth.  Opie, I have full faith that you won't, you can't do anything that you would normally do.  Because I think you have a few emotions in here.  So you know something, Opie?  Give me.  Look at her gift.  There it is.  It's in Opie's hands.  I know what.  I'm looking at him.  It's in Opie's hands.  I know.  I cannot picture him being heartless.  You've got to have some form of compassion and human emotion. 
[01:23:30]  I'm shaking real bad, man.  Right?  I'm shaking right now, man.  Come on.  Right?  No, it's nice.  There you go.  And what are you doing?  I'm just like...  You're pushing in on it.  Leave it alone.  What are you doing?  No, I'm just making sure it's sturdy so when we hang it in our office, it's not going to fall apart.  It's very sturdy.  Opie, what are you doing?  You're twisting it.  I'm not doing anything. 
[01:24:00]  No, stop.  Dude, I can't stand here.  What are you doing?  What's wrong, Patty?  What?  Nothing.  I thought we were all just having fun.  Look at the names.  Dude, you look at those names and picture her doing that.  Writing those in that crayon heat thing.  They're paint puns, Anthony.  Whatever, Patty.  I only gave you a present because I care.  Oh, did you hear that?  She only gave you a present because she cares. 
[01:24:30]  So I framed it.  It was very important.  It was an important article, Patty.  And not only did you frame it, but you personalized the frame.  Patty?  Which is very nice.  Yes, Opie.  I'm going to put this...  I'm going to put this...  Oh, yeah.  I see the hammer.  No.  Oh, Opie.  I'm going to put this in a safe place so we can hang it right after the show.  I'm sure you are.  No, look.  I'm going to take my headphones off carefully.  I know you are.  No, look.  Yeah, he's going to shed.  No, no.  What are you doing? 
[01:25:00]  What are you doing?  No, Opie, what are you...  Where are you going with that?  He's going to shed.  What are you doing?  Where are you putting...  I just put the gift down, Anthony.  Yeah, and it's on the floor.  That's a fun place for it.  What are you doing?  No, Opie, sit down.  Opie, Opie, sit down with that.  What?  What are you doing?  You got the big wow hammer.  It's right there.  Opie.  Opie, sit down.  What are you doing?  He's going to smash the lay ass.  She put a lot of work into... 
[01:25:30]  Opie, what are you...  Oh, my God.  Patty.  Patty, I want to offer an apology.  Thanks, Joe.  Oh, no, no.  Jesus.  Oh, Jesus, no.  All right.  Patty.  Look, see?  Now she's getting upset.  Look.  What?  She's all upset.  What happened? 
[01:26:00]  She put a lot of work into that.  What happened?  Look her right in the eyes right now.  She's shaking.  You all right, Patty?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, my God.  I never had anybody do that before.  What a gift.  I thought it was...  Oh, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't watch this.  Boy, do I feel like an a-hole.  Opie.  What?  What?  What happened?  Why did you do that? 
[01:26:30]  Because it makes me feel good.  Look.  She put a lot of work into that.  I thought it was something that you could hang up on your wall and save.  Yeah.  It's personally made.  I put a lot of time into it.  Oh.  Patty, I want to apologize for Opie.  I don't know.  Because that, that, that just isn't right.  That isn't right.  Oh, God.  All right.  Oh, Patty, Merry Christmas. 
[01:27:00]  Look, it's right here.  I wanted to break.  He had me so scared.  He was really, he was crying.  Now, tell everyone I didn't break the picture, because it is Christmas.  No, it's really intact.  Too bad this wasn't Easter.  You really had me going.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Patty.  We'll hang that in the office, okay?  Thank you very much, Patty. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  You're welcome.  All right.  Well, thanks for coming by.  Yeah, thank you, Patty, and Merry Christmas to you.  Thank you.  And good luck.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  Bye, I'll be right back.  Oh, my God.  You know what scared me about that whole thing?  What?  After I smashed the fake picture?  Yeah.  The look she gave me.  Did you see her eyes?  If she had a knife, she would have tried to stab me. 
[01:28:00]  Dude, did you see her eyes?  They were all welled up with tears, all red.  She was shaking.  She looked like she was just ready to have a nervous breakdown.  Christine.  Opie, I cannot believe you just did that.  I was just about to never listen to you guys again.  I'm in tears driving home.  I could not believe you.  But I'm glad you did it.  All right.  Thank you, Christine.  All right.  Bye. 
[01:28:30]  No, first of all, yeah, he didn't.  But I wouldn't give that picture another ten minutes in this studio to tell you the truth.  Because if he gets mad at something, that's the first thing that's going to fly into the CD case.  So, Rick, yeah, there you go.  Rick is now taking it out of the studio.  All right, man.  Why don't we take a break, okay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone's calling me a...  Hitler's calling me a pussy online, too.  Hitler's calling you a pussy.  Like I said, too bad it wasn't Easter. 
[01:29:00]  An Easter gift.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to take a break, so...  We'll be back, all right?  It's cold outside, but there's no holidays here.  People losing jobs, people living in fear.  I'm making my Christmas list.  Get down on my knees and pray for what I want. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, me and Anthony, bring me on Christmas Day.  Hanging out the stockings, trimming the tree.  Keep me working every day is all I want for me.  All I want for me. 
[01:30:00]  Put food on the table.  My present for my son.  O&A keep on working now.  That matter may be one.  May be one.  It's Christmas time.  There's no shopping lines.  I just hope that O&A keep me working every day.  I just hope that O&A keep me working every day is all I want for me. 
[01:30:30]  I just hope that O&A is all I want for me.  Put food on the table.  Put food on the table.  Put food on the table.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Buy a present for my son.  Oh, yeah.  If O&A keep on working now, that matter may be one. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, baby.  It's O&A.  It's O&A.  It's O&A.  Keep me working every day.  Screw St. Nick and his little red hat.  I need my job, and that's the fact.  It's O&A.  It's O&A.  Keep me working every day.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[01:31:30]  It's cold outside, but there's no holiday chill.  People losing jobs.  People living in fear.  Christmas is a fun time.  It is a fun time every December.  It is also a joy month.  I like this holiday a lot.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas. 
[01:32:00]  Merry Christmas.  Christmas is a fun time to get gifts.  People stay home for the holidays.  They spend time with their children.  That's what it is all about.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Christmas makes people feel right at home. 
[01:32:30]  Christmas gives me harmonization.  Christmas is Jesus Christ's birthday.  That's what it is all about in the mix.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Rock over London.  Rock out Los Angeles.  All state.  You're in good hands.  Merry Christmas.  So you think this is funny? 
[01:33:00]  The Frankie Blue thing?  I do.  I love it.  Anytime you can...  It's very voyeuristic.  Even though it's going out to a bunch of people on the radio, I think this is very voyeuristic.  It's an uncomfortable situation.  It's somebody put in a position they shouldn't have been in.  Well, I guess what happened, our old radio station, WNEW.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  There's a curse with our old station ever since we left.  Absolutely.  Ever since we left, it's just been in the toilet.  They can't figure out what to do with the station.  It's just failing miserably.  Ratings are always in the toilet.  They have tried how many different formats?  They've tried three or four since we left.  Yep.  And the one that did the best was the three months that they played Christmas music last year.  Right.  They started like at Halloween and played it through New Year.  And it did better than any format they put on there.  Well, our old company, they hired this dope John Sykes who was supposed to help the radio division. 
[01:34:00]  And the radio division has been a disaster ever since he took the helm.  And now they're just kind of paying him and he's like in a little office and no one bothers him because he's under contract.  And they're going to fire him real soon.  But he had no business trying to run the radio division of Viacom.  Got to bump Joel Hollander up into that position.  He's the genius.  Joel Hollander is an amazing radio guy and he will right the ship.  But this guy, John Sykes, which is just a waste of space, an asshole, a two-faced fuck. 
[01:34:30]  You know, he told Anthony and I when we did the Sex with Sam thing that we were going to be okay.  He said we were going to be okay.  And then all of a sudden he just blew us off, never talked to us again, and then just hid behind lawyers and, you know, and his secretary and stuff.  Never could get him on the phone again.  And we find out how he didn't like the show, didn't like what we were doing.  That's the type of executive you want running your radio division, a guy that doesn't have balls and will tell you to your face what's going on, you know.  Oh, didn't he think it was bad for kids, the show? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, he thought he knew what he was doing and we get fired and the station has been a complete disaster ever since.  And the radio division, quite frankly, has been a complete disaster ever since.  They lost millions upon millions of dollars and in the end it was John Sykes' fault.  Simple as that.  Joel Hollander wasn't running the radio division back then.  He just wasn't.  And, anyway, it's unheard of in radio history to have a station that has been floundering for as long as NEW.  It just doesn't happen. 
[01:35:30]  When that happens at a station, they fix it.  They fix the problem.  Right.  Especially in New York.  Right.  It's the number one mark in the country.  Right.  You can't have a radio property just sitting there with one rating.  And a history like NEW has.  Yeah.  It's in last place.  There are radio stations that don't even have a signal, a strong signal in Manhattan that are beating our old station.  Easy listening music stations from Long Island beat it out.  Right.  It's ridiculous.  So, getting back to the Frankie Blue thing and our old radio station that has just been in the toilet ever since we left. 
[01:36:00]  Falling apart.  Because they really thought they knew what they were doing by firing us and moving on.  Oh, yeah.  They figured they would compete with other stations that are doing very well around New York.  Because, boy, there's a win situation.  Go head-to-head against stations that are just entrenched in the market.  Have great ratings doing what they're doing.  Because people will just change their habits like that for the same thing they could get in the place that they've been for years and years and years.  Now, RuPaul is what? 
[01:36:30]  Their morning person now, aren't they?  Was RuPaul?  Person.  That's good.  Oh, whatever.  Yeah.  Morning guy.  Yeah.  It's a guy.  Morning parental disappointments.  When I...  It's RuPaul the drag queen does mornings over there.  Okay.  When I sit there and you have to listen to some people go, RuPaul, she is so pretty.  It's got a cock.  It's a guy.  Boy, you're a buzzkill.  Fine.  So then...  Big smooth back.  So then the old company gets the bright idea to hire this Frankie Blue guy because he was really good at KTU, I guess. 
[01:37:00]  What was KTU?  Kind of like a dance music.  So they're like, well, we'll hire the guy that made KTU great and we'll put him on NEW and he'll have the same success over here.  Right.  Well, so far he hasn't done anything except get drunk at Christmas gatherings.  Oh.  Our old pal Earl was here.  Earl.  Was there, I should say.  And Earl did not give us his tape.  I want to go on the record and tell you he did not have anything to do with the tape we're about to play. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  He didn't.  Okay.  So Frankie Blue was at the Christmas luncheon a couple days ago.  A Christmas luncheon?  They did a Christmas luncheon and I guess everyone got completely hammered.  I would too if I was working over there.  Destroyed.  As a matter of fact, I did.  Many times.  He got destroyed.  Destroyed everyone else.  And with the ratings that just came out, I think he had a few extra shots.  Because he's probably thinking, oh my God, I'm a fraud at this point.  Oh boy.  So then he goes back to the station and he gets into some kind of argument with the DJ that was supposed to go on the air. 
[01:38:00]  Now, if he was a little tipsy at the time, I'm thinking it probably wasn't one of those good legitimate arguments where you have a point.  I've been in arguments with drunk people.  They don't usually make good points during arguments.  You ever notice that?  What is that?  Why you got to wear that fucking shirt?  Oh, there's a good argument.  This one will last about 18 hours straight.  Yeah.  So that's what he does.  He goes over there, gets in a little tiff.  And it's the DJ that's supposed to go on the air. 
[01:38:30]  She pretty much runs out of the station crying or something.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  Oh boy.  But something happened and she just ran out.  So now someone has to do the radio show.  So who do they get to do the show?  Well, Frankie Blue is the boss over there.  He decides, oh, fuck her.  I'll just do it.  He's going to take the mic.  Oh, he's not a DJ?  He's not on air?  He's the program guy.  He's a legendary, quote, programmer here in New York.  Was he ever on the air?  You'll see how legendary he is in a minute here.  And then he goes, oh, fuck, I don't need her. 
[01:39:00]  I'll just do her shift.  And I'll do probably a better job.  Now he's doing it for WNEW.  During this, he's talking about KTU, which is their arch rival in competition.  He's just using the KTU call letters.  He makes a mistake and actually says, you know, on 1027 WKTU.  KTU.  And it's NEW.  Yeah, that's the station they're trying to beat.  Yeah.  Oops.  Oh, they must have been loving this at KTU.  I bet they play this and just laugh their balls off. 
[01:39:30]  So Earl was the producer.  Board op.  He's the board op guy.  The girl that does the show is supposed to do that.  And Earl hits the buttons when she goes to commercials and stuff like that.  He operates the board.  Yeah.  So he had the board op for Frankie, who's all hammered.  Right.  So Earl, I guess you hear him chime in a couple of times, I guess just out of nervousness.  And, you know, he must have been sitting there going, oh, my God, this guy's hammered.  He can't even talk.  He's stammering.  He's forgetting words.  He hiccups in one word and it makes the word two words.  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  And Earl's just, like you can tell, he's really nervous.  And then you've got to understand, too, this is one of those radio stations where you talk  really quickly between the music.  The music's the most important thing.  If you're talking more than 30 seconds, you're not doing your job.  He's talking for about four minutes here.  Oh, I know.  We cut it down.  You know, we'll play about two and a half minutes of this, but he's just babbling about  nothing, saying the wrong call letters.  This is the boss of the radio station that was supposed to put WNEW back on the map.  Here you go.  In New York radio.  The boss.  So here, you know, I've got to be honest. 
[01:40:30]  If they got Frankie Blue drunk every day to do a radio show, the ratings would go through  the roof.  I'd listen every day.  Absolutely.  And I hate that type of music, but that's the type of thing they should do.  Just get drunks on the air.  Drunk DJs.  Drunk DJs.  Uh-huh.  I love this song.  This is the fucking boss.  I love this song.  He's fucking hammered.  And don't think for a second that this is some kind of relaxed, laid-back delivery.  Yeah, this is not radio from the 70s when all the DJs were encouraged to talk like this. 
[01:41:00]  This guy's hammered.  This is the type of station where, you know, your voice has to be way up there, like,  WKTU!  Yeah, high energy.  Don't forget RuPaul at the morning.  Yeah.  Yeah, high energy.  Your next chance to win $2,000 coming up with RuPaul tomorrow morning right here.  RuPaul, let's get back to the music.  Right.  The new mix, W-N-A-W.  That's the delivery you're supposed to have.  Right.  And he's the boss.  Uh-huh.  I love this song. 
[01:41:30]  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been, um, giving you a chance to win $50,000 in cash.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That is snorted.  Wow.  Hey, this is Frankie Blue.  This was the guy that was supposed to get N.E.W. out of the toilet. 
[01:42:00]  He's taking the record off the turntable.  You think he's going to use the turntable?  Oh, I take pleasure in this.  God.  That dumb station.  They really stink.  Oh.  In the mix, one, oh, two, seven, redo.  And plus win a Toyota Scion.  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning. 
[01:42:30]  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  Oh.  Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house, like, publishing clearance.  Publishers.  Why?  Publishing clearance?  Did he try to say, like, publisher's clearing house?  Yeah, publishing clearance.  Publishing clearance.  Oh, man.  Hey, I've been snotted on the air a couple of times, but never. 
[01:43:00]  Your station is cursed.  The devil.  No.  Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house, like, publishing clearance.  Or whether it's a house or it's a job.  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you.  And we're going to reward you with $50,000 and a brand-new Toyota.  And I don't see how you cannot be happy about that. 
[01:43:30]  This is Frankie Blue.  So make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m.  50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner.  What?  I mean, is they're giving away the 50 people who are going to win a grand?  Wait.  50 grand prize winner.  50 winners of the grand prize?  Or is it 50 grand prize winner?  I don't know.  Or is it a real drunk guy on the air? 
[01:44:00]  And when you do one of these shows, you know, you have to speak perfectly.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I speak like an idiot.  My grammar stinks.  But it doesn't really matter.  It's a talk show.  You just go with the flow.  And if I fuck up, you know, someone's going to jump on me and tell me so.  But at these radio stations, everything has to be just perfect.  Right.  And you're not supposed to just babble and babble.  You've got to get back to the music.  Yeah.  As far as I'm concerned, you guys never fuck up.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  Very sweet.  Just enjoy your hustler and let us do the heavy lifting here, okay? 
[01:44:30]  Isn't that funny?  That's right.  50 grand prize winner of the redo contest of the winner of the Toyota Scion.  Come on, baby.  You know you want it.  If you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there.  Pick the winner.  I thought he was really going to go for it. 
[01:45:00]  RuPaul's going to dip his fat cock in that.  He's going to put some Elmer's glue on the tip of his big fat cock.  Because that's a guy, you know.  Dip it into the winner and pick out one to add the...  You know, when we were in the bathroom, I was holding RuPaul's fat cock.  This is the boss.  I love this.  Winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. 
[01:45:30]  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick a winner, and we're going to fine you.  Earl lost his mind right there.  And I don't care if it takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right?  We have the armored truck.  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town.  So why don't you give me a call?  Mike, this is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez. 
[01:46:00]  And telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-MIX-1027.  So give me a call.  Okay, baby?  Thank you.  Okay, baby.  If you're in your car right now, chances are you're sitting in traffic.  Then he goes back on.  Yeah, we've got one more.  Probably the biggest radio faux pas you could ever make is screwing up those calls.  And especially when you screw them up by replacing them with the competition's call letters. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  He's supposed to, for people all over the country, say WNEW.  Right.  But he says KTU, which is their arch rival.  Pick the two stations in your city that battle it out between each other.  And picture one of the jocks being drunk and making the mistake of using the other station's call.  So here's the boss at our old station.  I'd drink, too, if I was the boss over at that shithole.  Completely hammered.  Ratings are in the toilet.  He has to go on the air.  He thought he could handle it.  And this is some more of him doing his little show. 
[01:47:00]  Mix-1027.  The new Mix-1027.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  He's like all the old Foster Brooks.  I'm so excited for tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Oh.  Tomorrow.  A drunken hiccup comes out of him in mid-word.  Nice buzz, man.  Wow.  That must have been a great Christmas luncheon. 
[01:47:30]  Must have been luncheon.  What time was this going on?  Noon to three, four maybe?  Love the nooners, man.  Pounding them during the nooners.  Here we go.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky and Rue.  Coming in in the morning.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Putting their hand in the big old barrel and...  Picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner. 
[01:48:00]  $50,000.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo.  Oh, there it is.  Winner of the KTU Mix 102.  Ooh, where the hell do I work?  Is he going to start singing Janis Joplin tunes?  Wow.  He is.  Oh, my God.  This doesn't sound like just alcohol, by the way.  That's my opinion.  Dude, this sounds like you're fired. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  This is a firing offense.  Yeah, because this is the boss.  This isn't some stupid DJ that has a coke problem that you're trying to take care of.  What?  She should be fired for walking off the shift.  He's the boss.  Dude, he told her to leave, or did he just leave?  It just shows you that the old place is still a fucking train wreck.  Yeah, it is.  It's a dump.  Yeah, smart move, getting rid of Opie and Anthony.  The only thing that was happening over there.  Even when you were there, it stunk, except for Ron and Fez.  Those guys did okay.  Well, us and Ron and Fez, we kept the ship going. 
[01:49:00]  Yep.  They were making a lot of money off our show and Ron and Fez.  They should have backed us.  Instead, they got this mess.  Two years later, two and a half years later, they still have nothing.  Some of the most entertaining programming I've ever heard out of that station, though.  Right here.  I would put this guy on the air every day drunk.  Every day drunk.  I would listen every freaking day.  And he's, quote, a legend in New York radio.  Wow.  How embarrassed do you think he is this morning if he's up yet?  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:30]  When you wake up sober and you'll hear it, you'll be like, ugh.  All hungover, shaking, feeling a little nauseous.  Your head is pounding and your phone's ringing.  Yeah, Frankie, pick up.  Pick up.  Yeah, I heard your...  What, are you stupid?  You fucking drunk?  You get a call from Infinity yet?  You will.  Yeah, you will.  Take a couple of aspirin and get your ass out of bed, because I'm sure you'll be in a meeting today.  Can you say fired? 
[01:50:00]  Fired.  Yeah, call up Opie and Anthony.  They'll give you some pointers on what to do during your time off.  You idiot.  Dude, I emailed it to everybody this morning.  Frankie, it's your mom.  Hi.  How you doing?  Dr. Phil said when you give something up to replace it with something else, so I was  good to see you giving up the N.E.W. call letters and replacing it with the K.T.U. call  letters, you stupid fuck.  I'm your mother, so I can say that.  Come on over.  We'll do shots.  I love you. 
[01:50:30]  Isn't that great?  There's just a little more here.  I got to hear the K.T.U.  I hear there's a third clip.  Oh, that is not good.  The GM came in and took him off the air?  He's the Mac Daddy at every radio station.  Doesn't go much higher than the GM.  Who finished the shift?  Probably just played music and Earl pushed the button.  That's good.  When your big boss has to come into the studio and you're supposed to be in charge of all  your DJs and tell you to get the fuck off the air.  Get off.  You've had it.  You are so fired.  Go home. 
[01:51:00]  Fired.  Come out like the manager going to the mound.  Just get out.  Get out.  Do you got the K.T.U. line in there again?  Did you rewind it a little?  I got to hear him screw up on the calls again.  Yeah.  He's supposed to say WNEW once again.  His winner.  The winner of the K.T.U.  Mix 102 Redo Contest.  And also you win a Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel. 
[01:51:30]  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 102.7.  He's stepping all over.  He's supposed to be done by the time those lyrics kick in.  That is like the most important thing in that type of radio.  In that type of radio, man, you've got to hit the post.  It's called hit the post.  Right, exactly.  What did he say?  We're going to fuck the winner?  Oh, is that where they thought he cursed?  Toyota Scion. 
[01:52:00]  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  Fight?  What?  What was that?  I think he said fuck.  They're going to fuck that winner.  I think he was going to say fuck it and was able to stop just in time.  Fight that winner.  Wait, that's not a word.  Hand in the barrel. 
[01:52:30]  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 102.7.  Frankie Blue.  What's happening?  What's happening?  He tries to have the cool little thing like he's out.  Like, yeah, I meant to step all over the vocals.  Frankie Blue, what's happening, baby?  All I know is the FCC should hear about that.  Oh.  And they're going to fight that winner.  At least you guys never said that. 
[01:53:00]  Huh?  Right in the asshole.  Frankie Blue, baby.  They're going to stick it in the barrel and they're going to pull it out and fuck the fucking fucker.  Frankie Blue, baby.  On KTU.  W-N-E-double.  W.  The Opie and Anthony.  K-N-B-C.  Yeah.  On the rock of Boston. 
[01:53:30]  BCN.  Where am I?  On W-D-R-U-N-K.  Well, this story is developing, but I do believe he's fired.  Fired.  How long has he been there?  Not too long, man.  He was supposed to be the big hire that was going to turn around that crap hole.  That was it.  He was going to be the guy.  That's the turnpike, that big fire.  Jersey turnpike.  Do you know what that's got to be doing to traffic?  Oh, boy. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, boy.  We have audio of the general manager coming in to Frankie Blue.  You're fired.  Do you have the audio of Frankie Blue after he was fired?  If I may.  A little more.  All right.  You're fired.  Wow.  You had to tell him twice.  And trying to console him, I guess.  It's over, Johnny.  Wow.  And then Frankie Blue.  Okay.  We got some Frankie Blue audio here.  Don't you do it.  Don't you. 
[01:54:30]  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nothing else.  Yeah.  I love when it's someone else, man.  Oh.  It's the best.  Oh, it is a treat when it's not us.  All right.  Well, we have to take a break.  That's right, baby.  All right. 
[01:55:00]  That's okay, baby.  Frankie Blue here, baby.  We're going to have a winner, and we're going to fuck him.  I can play that all morning.  Oh, it's classic.  I wasn't sure if it was that good, but it is hilarious.  This is the Opie and Anthony show here at Sirius Satellite Radio.  That's right, baby.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony's Christmas edition.  Where's your headphones, Earl?  All right.  No big deal. 
[01:55:30]  How is it over there at NEW?  Quiet.  Hey, thanks for that tape, by the way.  All right.  Oh, oh, oh.  I did not.  I swear.  As Christ is my witness, I have nothing to do with it.  Oh, no.  With what?  The Frankie Blue tape that you handed me personally?  No.  In the middle of the night when no one was looking?  You're an awful human being, you know?  Earl had nothing to do with the Frankie Blue tape.  Of course not.  Aside from the fact that you ran the board, right?  Anthony, why are you winking as you say that?  I know.  What were you thinking as that was happening? 
[01:56:00]  It was over.  That's all I was thinking.  Why didn't you say to him?  Did you say something like during commercials or something and say, hey, you know, maybe  you're a little too intoxicated to be on the air?  I have no response to that.  I have no comment.  No comment.  He's so shy.  He is a typical Viacom employee.  What are you going to do?  Cut your two out?  He's like Dana McClintock.  Bland douche.  Anything, Earl?  Can you contribute anything to this program by telling us what was going on?  Absolutely nothing. 
[01:56:30]  I got nothing.  You don't want to talk about it?  No.  The drunk.  Was he indeed drunk?  No comment.  More info from Bernie Goetz.  And he shot poor guys.  Had he been drinking at the Christmas party?  Were you at the Christmas party?  There was a party earlier, yes.  Oh, and was he drinking at that party?  I don't know, quite honestly.  You don't know?  I honestly don't know.  No.  No, I think he was popping something.  What was the argument about between him and the...  That I don't know. 
[01:57:00]  I swear to God.  Did she walk out crying?  I don't know that either.  What do you mean you'll tell us off the air?  No, I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  I'm telling you.  Isolate that.  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  Nothing.  No.  I don't know what the argument was about.  I have no idea what happened.  Okay.  You were in there.  You were working the board.  Who finally took him off the air?  I think he actually pulled himself.  Now stop.  You're not being honest.  No, I am being honest.  Why did he pull himself? 
[01:57:30]  One minute he was there, one minute he was gone.  And that's all I know.  No one came in during that time?  No.  It's not what we heard.  All right, don't give us any information on what happened with Frankie.  Earl, another great appearance.  Thank you.  Earl, great.  I heard Earl treated Opie finally to lunch or dinner, was it?  What was it?  Not really.  And Earl finally fessed up?  What'd you treat him to, Earl?  I didn't treat anybody.  When I didn't have money, I was telling these guys. 
[01:58:00]  So you had to like...  I coughed up some...  I always offer money.  Always.  Always.  To prostitutes, maybe.  Always?  Yes.  I've never seen you offer money at any of the dinners.  It's usually everyone else digging in or someone pulling out a credit card.  I always put money on the...  Ben told me you had a burger and a bunch of sodas one day and just paid for the burger without  the tax or any of the sodas.  No, that's not...  I always overpay.  No, you...  You do not.  Goodbye, everybody. 
[01:58:30]  Goodbye, everybody.  Wait, Earl.  Oh, Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Come on, Earl.  Earl.  He's black and Jewish.  Come on, Earl.  Sammy Davis.  I can't believe he walked out.  I can.  He has a good jawline, though.  He actually left the studio.  Goodbye.  He's got his head down and everything.  Bye-bye.  I'm not coming in.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  It's the Worciful Beer Anthony's Christmas Edition.  That's terrific. 
[01:59:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Okay, terrific.  That's terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  Okay, terrific.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  All right.  Got a few updates.  Because this show is a soap opera. 
[01:59:30]  We know that.  Yeah.  The saga that is Frankie Blue is over, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Is over.  Hopefully we replayed the Frankie Blue stuff in some of the worst of in the past few days.  Oh, yeah, we did.  We did?  Thursday.  Oh, good.  So a lot of people know what we're talking about here, then.  Because we got a lot of new listeners through the holiday.  Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue.  Frankie blew up his spot there at N.E.W.  Blue, you're my boy. 
[02:00:00]  You're my boy, Blue.  Thanks for all the great radio.  Sorry you got fired.  You're my boy, Blue.  You're my boy, Blue.  You're fired.  Blue, you're my boy.  You're fired.  You're my boy, Blue.  So you want to explain Frankie Blue really fast, Anthony?  Yeah.  Frankie Blue was the program director.  You know, the boss over there at the station we used to work at.  W-N-E-W in New York.  And they do like, what would you call that music? 
[02:00:30]  Music that gay guys play when they're having sex?  Yeah, you could call it that.  I don't know what it is.  It's like that dance type music and like music that dopey chicks put on in their car all the time.  Just that crap.  What's a good example, like a song that they would play?  I don't know.  I'm just trying to like, so people get the grasp of the type of station it is to know that 
[02:01:00]  it's not like this, where you could come on drunk, people have, you know, and get away with it.  It's not that type of thing.  It's very fast delivery that the jocks give.  And Frankie Blue was at a Christmas party.  Got a little tanked, it seemed.  Went back to his station and got in a little argument with the girl that was supposed to be coming on the air.  And that's what they're saying he got fired for.  Right.  It's just for the argument.  But he figures now she's gone.  And he threw her out of there that day. 
[02:01:30]  Now he was going to take to the airwaves and show the talent that is Frankie Blue,  all hammered from the Christmas party.  He gets on just slurring and stumbling through the show that he was doing.  And then I think the worst thing I think that he did, he called WNEW WKTU,  which is the competitor of the station.  So it kind of, it really looked bad.  You're not supposed to be the boss doing that.  And at the time, we got a hold of this tape and exploited it to the max. 
[02:02:00]  Of course we did.  And now there's radio guys all over the country that have copies of this and they're playing it for each other.  They think it's one of the greatest things ever.  I've talked to more radio guys that said, oh my God, I'm sending this to everybody.  And all the guys in radio were playing it, listening to it like it was the funniest thing ever.  Because we love when people screw up.  Especially when it has something to do with our old station.  Yep.  Another program director losing his job at our old station.  Yeah.  They've been through a lot of them since we left there. 
[02:02:30]  It's been an abomination since they unjustly booted you guys.  That is correct, sir.  An abomination in the biggest radio market in the country.  Yeah.  And that station has been an abomination for the last two and a half years.  You wouldn't see...  An embarrassment.  You wouldn't see a station this screwed up in a 200 market.  You wouldn't see it.  And this is the number one market in the country and it has been just a mess for you.  A disaster.  A legendary station. 
[02:03:00]  After the music went down, they put you guys on and you're the only thing on the station.  And then Ron and Fez start to do very well.  Of course there's no morning show because they don't want to compete with Howard in New York.  So they put nothing on in the morning.  It's just an embarrassment, man.  It has been.  And the revolving door of program directors that have gone through there.  If you take that gig, you're insane.  Because you're not going to be the one that straightens it out.  There is no quick fix for that place and they're not in it for the long haul.  So you're just done. 
[02:03:30]  There's no quick fix.  But they don't want to wait for a longer solution to take place.  So they just keep firing the people that can't fix it quick enough or they get drunk on the air.  At least that was an original firing.  The past bosses of program directors that have been through there have been fired because it just hasn't worked out.  They can't get the station going.  And now they've got some new guy.  Yeah, Rick Martini.  A 25-year radio veteran.  Did a lot with his career, obviously. 
[02:04:00]  You know what's wrong with 25-year radio veterans?  He's going to bring nothing new to any W.  Nothing new.  A 25-year veteran uses all the stuff he's learned over 25 years, which is the same old crap that no one wants to listen to.  It's not new.  It's not cutting edge.  It's not something people are going to tune into and go, wow, this is something.  I've got to hear this.  Because they'll hear it elsewhere. 
[02:04:30]  No one's going to switch.  If you could go to KTU, say, which is the other station that plays this kind of crap.  Do we have one of those songs?  Do we actually have one?  They play this?  Are you kidding me?  Isn't this Donna Summer?  Just Donna Summer.  Last Dance.  Hey, baby, it's Frankie Blue with this Donna Summer.  And we're going to listen to this last dance.  Last dance, Earl.  Dance with me, Earl.  You're working my board for me today. 
[02:05:00]  It's Frankie Blue, baby.  Let me tell you something.  We're here at WKY.  W-Y.  Right.  KTU.  Where are we?  Any double dip or double shit?  W-L-S-T.  Oh, no, that's what I took before I came in.  W.  Give me another drink here.  Merry Christmas, everyone.  W-E-E-E.  Oh, no, that's something else I took before I came in today.  I'm sorry.  Frankie Blue, baby.  You know, this is a Christmas party I won't forget very soon. 
[02:05:30]  A Christmas party that got me fired, and I didn't even copy my sack and asshole in the copy machine.  And I still got in trouble for a Christmas party.  Frankie Blue?  Why?  Well, I needed the money.  Oh, that's terrific.  Frankie Blue in there.  I'll tell you, that's terrific.  Frankie Blue his job up.  Welcome to WH-I-V.  Wait, wait.  That's just people that enjoy this music.  Come on.  Let's dance, baby.  Let's dance.  Hey, I just said that. 
[02:06:00]  I'd like to take Donna Summer and fuck Donna Summer.  Donna Summer.  Yeah, here on KTU.  We got our big contest going.  We're going to win a Sky on or what are we winning?  I don't know.  Tune in to Frankie Blue for the next five minutes because that's all I'll be here before they throw my drunk ass out.  RuPaul's going to take his big manly hands and freeze into Donna Summer's box.  I mean, what a mess he was at that.  I'm going to do a little riff, you know, because I'm Frankie Blue. 
[02:06:30]  You know, we got RuPaul in here.  I was in the bathroom.  What a huge horse cock on that black guy.  Let me tell you, what a huge horse cock.  What?  Are we on the arrow?  Uh-oh.  And you know the station, the on-air talent did not address it honestly.  You know they didn't goof on it once it happened.  Just don't talk about it.  Just pretend it didn't happen.  Or to make believe it didn't happen until we fire you.  That's pretty much what radio does.  Well, because we said it earlier.  I mean, they've taken the fun out of radio. 
[02:07:00]  Everyone has taken this whole thing so seriously.  No spontaneity.  It's just radio.  It's the stupidest job in America.  Yeah.  And no one has a sense of humor anymore.  If this happens on your radio station, you've got to go with it.  I agree with you, baby.  Frankie Blue agrees with you.  Corporate people are talentless, humorless faggots, and they ruin everything they touch that is creative.  Every time corporations get involved with creativity, you ruin it.  Shut up!  Oh, sorry.  Try to suck everybody.  Router! 
[02:07:30]  Flashback.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, baby.  On the new KTU.  How long has this station been around?  Why do we still call it new?  Frankie Blue here.  Get me another goddamn drink.  Woo!  Blue!  You're my boy!  Oh, that's me.  You're not funny.  You're not interesting.  And that's why when things like this happen, you don't know what to do with it.  You just clam up and pretend it didn't happen.  Fire it.  96 was when they were the new KTU.  All right.  They still call themselves the new.  So there's the Frankie Blue update.  He got fired for the audio we're about to play. 
[02:08:00]  So he yells and screams at the poor girl that was supposed to be on the air, whatever her name is.  She's some legend, too, I guess.  Whatever.  She's still got a job there?  I guess.  Oh, you bet she does.  I thought maybe they'd just eliminate the entire problem.  You know, sometimes just flush it out, make like it never happened.  We don't have to look at her.  We don't have to think about him.  You know, they kind of do that sometimes.  But I'm sure she would sue.  Oh, yeah.  And probably rightfully so.  Someone said he manhandled her.  I don't know if he did or not.  He shoved her out. 
[02:08:30]  I have some respect for him now.  I would, too.  I want to show her who's boss.  Yeah.  Something he used to be.  He thought he was big enough.  Show her who used to be boss.  He thought he was big enough to go on the air and do a radio shift.  And we got our hands on the audio.  Yeah, baby.  Here's Frankie Blue blowing up his career, baby.  Here it is.  End of the year.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I love this song.  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue. 
[02:09:00]  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been giving you a chance to win $50,000 in cash in the Mix 1027 redo.  And plus win a Toyota Scion.  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning. 
[02:09:30]  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m., Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like publishing clearance.  Well, whether it's a house or it's a job.  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you.  And we're going to reward you with $50,000 in a brand-new Toyota.  And I don't see how you cannot be happy about that. 
[02:10:00]  This is Frankie Blue.  So make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m., 50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner.  That's terrific.  That's right.  That's terrific.  50 grand prize winner of the redo contest, of the winner of the Toyota Scion.  Come on, baby.  You know you want it.  But if you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. 
[02:10:30]  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick the winner, and we're going to find you.  And I don't care if it takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right?  We have the armored truck.  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town. 
[02:11:00]  So why don't you give me a call?  This is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez.  And the telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-MIX-1027.  It's just a tool.  Okay, baby?  Thank you.  He's the boss.  I can't get past that.  And I don't know anybody who would not want to do this.  What a drunk. 
[02:11:30]  See, we are really lucky that Earl got us that thing.  That is so cool.  Black Earl.  Earl, you got us the tape, right?  I'm being honest.  I don't know anything.  Oh, he doesn't know anything about it.  All right, Earl.  And then here's the second part that we have where he basically, we're not sure if he wants  to fuck the winner of this contest or if he was hiccuping.  He's so fired.  So completely fired that you are fired before anyone even knows you're fired. 
[02:12:00]  So fired.  This is just all about being so fired.  So completely and thoroughly fired.  And he did get fired while we were in Vegas.  But this is what did him in.  Yeah, I agree with Jim.  We know how they work over there.  The other one, you could get behind closed doors to yell at you, like, what are you doing,  you idiot?  We know how they operate over there.  Me and Opie are the pros of knowing when you're fired.  We just know.  We know when other jocks do things, like, we'll read it on the internet or something  or in the paper, some jock screws up in some market out in the Midwest, and me and Opie 
[02:12:30]  are on the phone with each other just going, dude, did you read that?  Oh, yeah.  Dude, fired.  So fired.  This guy is so fired.  And you're reading the paper.  No, they just removed him from the air, suspended him.  They said for a week.  And me and Opie are like, fired.  Fired.  Fired.  So fired.  And at the end of the week?  Fired.  So fired.  We know.  So here it is.  This is what doomed him.  Mix 102.7.  The new Mix 102.7.  This is Frankie Blue. 
[02:13:00]  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  Bro.  I got Ricky and Rue.  Tamar.  Oh.  Coming in in the morning.  Putting a hand in the big old barrel and picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest. 
[02:13:30]  And also you win a Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  Okay.  Terrific.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 102.7.  Frankie Blue.  What's that?  Good evening.  Good evening.  Good evening to you.  Bye-bye.  I can't wait till tomorrow. 
[02:14:00]  Oh.  Tomorrow.  Oh.  What was that?  How drunk do you have to be when you're doing the Foster Brooks impression?  Tomorrow.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Dean.  What a mess.  That got him thrown right out the door.  So that's the end of that soap opera.  Frankie Blue is done.  Frankie Blue.  We've been having so much fun with that audio, too, man.  It's one of my favorite things. 
[02:14:30]  You better watch out.  You better not cry.  You're going to go dry.  I'm telling you why.  Santa's whore is coming to town.  She's making a fist.  Stroking it twice.  Grabbing your balls and checking for lice.  Santa's whore is coming to town.  Well, she blows you when it's flaccid.  She humps you when it's stiff. 
[02:15:00]  She don't care if you're bad or good.  She'll make you take a whiff.  Oh.  You better watch out.  She'll sit on your face.  When your cock's right out, you'll put your thumb in its place.  Santa's whore is coming.  Santa's whore is coming.  Santa's whore is coming.  It's a holly, jolly Christmas. 
[02:15:30]  Best time of the year.  I don't know if there'll be snow, but have a cup of cheer.  It's a holly, jolly Christmas.  And when you walk down the street, say hello to friends you know and everyone you meet.  Hey, what are you doing? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, it's an office Christmas party next week.  I do a number.  It's good for morale.  Helps get me laid.  Hey, everybody.  This is William Shatner.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Talking about Christmas tits.  Tits?  I love Christmas tits.  Christmas tits.  You decorate them up?  I don't mind giving Christmas tips.  I think I did this.  We did this break last year.  Well, it's a yearly thing.  But it gets more involved this year. 
[02:16:30]  My building.  I live in Manhattan.  Jimmy's going through this, too.  Right around late November.  Actually, it starts in early November.  The staff at your building that you live in, they start being really nice to you.  Going out of their way.  Do they?  Look you in the eye.  Hello, Mr. Hughes.  How's your day, Mr. Hughes?  Did you have a good day, Mr. Hughes?  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  This was last year when I didn't know what the hell it was all about.  What the scam was.  And then late November, right after Thanksgiving, there's a packet that everyone receives. 
[02:17:00]  Of all the people that work in the building, what they do so you could then tip them accordingly for Christmas.  What they do.  Oh, they let you know.  Like, this guy's a maintenance dude.  This guy's actually the head of maintenance.  This guy's a concierge.  This guy's a doorman.  This guy's security.  This guy's this and that and that and that and that.  That last year, my Christmas tips for my building reached over $2,000, Anthony. 
[02:17:30]  Wow.  That's insanity.  And I think the highest guy got maybe $100 and something.  Jimmy's going through this, too.  And I thought Christmas tips were like, oh, you know what?  I remember a few guys in my building that I kind of like and they really take care of me.  They went above and beyond.  And then you give them a little envelope like, hey, man, between you and I, thank you.  Happy holidays.  Enjoy.  Yeah, yeah.  But now it's this involved thing with a pamphlet, with pictures and everything.  Well, now they hand out envelopes like it's expected. 
[02:18:00]  But that's what I'm trying to say.  It's a shakedown.  It shouldn't be expected.  No, it shouldn't.  You should decide on your own if you want to tip the people that help you on a daily basis.  Who helps you and who doesn't?  Some people, I don't even fucking know.  Dude, half these people on my list I've never seen before in the building.  But you feel obligated.  You've got to give everyone a tip.  And then they have a big, huge tip box in the lobby of my building.  Yeah, a big tip box.  So now you can just...  I've got a Sloan Kettering.  Tip.  Okay, that was really bad.  You can put the envelope right into the box.  So now you don't even, you know, because you're not going to see half these people. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Can I just say the beauty of comedy is that Anthony just did a joke and I can see he didn't realize anyone.  He just went, why did I say that?  Why did I say it?  I know.  Exactly.  I want to apologize.  So you should do what I do, man.  Like, I don't tip.  What I do is I find a reason.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  From November on to find fault with everyone.  Every body and everything they do.  Why is this door not being held open?  It's my bathroom.  I'm alone. 
[02:19:00]  Fire, everyone!  You know, we got assholes that live in our building that if the doorman's busy getting someone a cab or something, they will not open the door themselves to go outside.  They will actually wait right in front of the door until the doorman comes back to open the door for them.  Right.  Fucking cunts.  Oh, my God.  No, they're just fucking entitled assholes.  So, anyway, there's a garage that a bunch of us park in every morning, and a list was just handed to Kenny, all the people that work at that garage, for Christmas tips. 
[02:19:30]  Yep.  For Christmas tips.  Do you tip them?  Just because you're a monthly parker at the garage, now you've got to tip everybody for Christmas.  Do you tip them every time?  Who?  They get your car?  Yeah.  I don't.  See, I probably should.  What, in my building?  Yes.  No.  Well, yeah, I do.  I give them, like, a dollar every time, two dollars every time, depending on the guys.  Some of the guys are cool.  No, I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about the work garage downstairs. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Kenny just got a pamphlet of names and faces of the guys that work at the garage so they could get their Christmas tip action.  It's not a tip anymore is what I'm saying.  Yeah, it becomes something different than a tip.  You know, if you want to tip somebody, it's great.  I like tipping.  I love tipping people when they do a great job.  They come in, they deliver shit, whatever they're fucking doing.  You know what?  And over the years, you know exactly who to tip because they're taking care of you.  They're working hard. 
[02:20:30]  You have some kind of relationship with the guy.  You're like, oh, that guy, man.  Yeah, he's really good to me.  I'm going to make sure I give him a little something around the holidays.  You know what?  That's how it started.  Here's what I don't get.  Tipping the mailman.  The mailman expects you to tip him.  You tip him just for not killing his co-workers or putting anthrax on your notes.  All right.  That's good.  And the garbage men expect a big tip on Long Island.  That's the thing.  There's privately owned garbage companies.  Right.  It's not like the city. 
[02:21:00]  Sure.  And they expect you to give your garbage collector a tip.  Sure.  But it's like that's –  Dude, I understand all that.  That's the job.  But you go out and you pick up the garbage.  I got 40 people in my building.  I got a tip now.  Why?  Why do I have to tip 40 people for living in a building?  Like I would tip some of these guys just because it's the right thing to do.  See, I don't know.  Like, yes, I literally –  Dude, you have the same thing going on, right?  Oh, I do.  But I recognize – 
[02:21:30]  Excuse me.  Most of them.  Like, I interact with most of them fairly often.  Maintenance guys.  You've never seen half those maintenance guys.  Honestly.  Really?  All of them.  Like, when I see the garage guys –  Because I get my car every night to go down and work.  So, literally, I recognize 75% of them.  I recognize all the garage guys.  80% of them.  Sure.  The maintenance guys, the door guys.  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Any of them I would feel bad about sliding when I see all their pictures.  Because it might be one or two where I'll go, oh, yeah, yeah.  I've seen it.  But most of them I see all the time.  No, you can't slide any of them now that there's a list. 
[02:22:00]  You can't.  Now there's a list.  So, what?  There's a – Danny pulled up a whole thing of who you're supposed to tip and how much.  And the list is endless.  Giant.  What's the tip for, say –  Wait, let's go over this list real fast.  Concierge.  What do we got?  I'm pretty good with the tips.  Is this just basic living?  Yeah, pretty much.  For the average person, right?  Come across most of these people.  If you live in a building or –  All right, what do you got, Danny?  Gardeners, things like that.  Let's rock this.  Babysitter, daycare, where do you want to start at?  Building people.  Well, you got an apartment doorman. 
[02:22:30]  And this – according to this tipping guide, you should be tipping your doorman anywhere between $10 and $100.  Can they fucking be a little bit more vague?  What, is this some kind of manners website or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, just a holiday tipping guide.  You're building superintendent.  How much?  $50 to $200.  Yeah, I usually give $200 to $250 to my super.  But he's taking good care of me.  What does he do?  If I've ever had any problems, like when I wanted to buy a storage unit, he went out of his way to help me.  Like, I like the guy.  I think he's good.  Well, that's personal good guy being a good guy shit. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Not just because he's the building superintendent, right?  No, I actually like the guy.  Here we go.  I had to buy my superintendent concert tickets because he knows what I do.  And he's like, he asked about a show.  And I basically told him, look, I can't get those tickets.  I'm really sorry.  So he goes, well, all right.  Well, then how about Clapton?  So I asked Kenny.  I had to toll out about fucking $700 to get this guy two tickets to a show that I had no connections for. 
[02:23:30]  What the fuck?  What kind of idiot is your super?  My super would never do that.  He goes, all right, well, I forgot what it was.  It was either for, like, the dead or somebody was coming around.  And I couldn't get the tickets.  So he goes and names another show.  I'm like, I'm basically telling you I don't have connections to these shows you want.  I need some fucking tickets.  It's Brett Weir to super across the way.  Right.  You get me your fucking tickets.  So then I felt like, holy shit, I'm being held up here.  I got to get him.  I got to get this guy tickets.  He runs the building.  I don't need to talk to you, jerky. 
[02:24:00]  Let's say hi to Hank in Connecticut.  Hank.  Hank.  How you doing?  Hello, man's name.  Jesus, that's a fucking man.  Hank.  There's never a fruity guy named Hank.  Hank.  Who's punching you in the face?  Oh, that would be Hank.  What up, Hank?  Hey, I got home yesterday, and yesterday was Recycling Day, and on the bottom of my bin was a stapled note with a return address for the guy to send him a check for Christmas.  That's good.  Just leave it in there. 
[02:24:30]  It's recyclable, right?  That's right.  It's paper.  I put it right back in the garbage.  It's paper.  How did that start is what I'm saying.  Because, you know, back in the day, and we all like to say back in the day, you were just tip people that you felt, you know, were doing the right thing around you.  Can I send an envelope with my name on it and stuff just to, like, our bosses?  I want to send, like, I want to give, like, you know, Bladder and Scott and all the way up the top and just go, because I come in here and do my job. 
[02:25:00]  Are you feeling okay?  And do my job.  I would like, you know, a little gratuity, a little tip.  Oh, I see.  Based on.  Oh, you want to give them the blank envelope.  Right.  See, so they, because, yeah.  Now, I'm coming in here on a daily basis doing my job.  So then they should fill the envelope up with a little cash and give it to me.  I'd be happy if I put the envelope into those offices and I opened it and they had taken a shit in the envelope.  I would say thank you so much for at least keeping it consistent with the way you view me here. 
[02:25:30]  I told you you would get to.  I'm not even mad, but that's cool.  What would be really nice is this.  You open the envelope, right, and there's a big steaming shit in it, but it's a musical envelope, so it plays a sweet song.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, we value you, we value you a lot.  And it's just, it's full of shit.  Yeah, there's a big, a log in the envelope.  I can go, thank you for the flowery word.  Let me eat this. 
[02:26:00]  That's nice.  It's delicious.  Let me eat.  Lovely snack.  Let me spoon it out.  It's a mushy one.  Let's go to J.R. in Connecticut.  J.R.  Who shot you?  What's up, boys?  What's up, J.R.?  No, you did.  Yes, I did.  Huh?  Sorry.  I said happy birthday, Jimmy.  What do you got, J.R.?  All right.  So, I live in Connecticut, right?  And I lived in the same place for four years now.  The first two years, I didn't tip my garbage man, because, you know, I'm a younger guy.  I don't know if you tip your garbage man.  The first couple years, I'm living on my own. 
[02:26:30]  He leaves my fucking garbage cans in the middle of the street.  Right away, you're fucking fresh.  The second year, the second year, or the third year, I give the guys two 20s in the envelope.  Yeah.  They still leave my garbage can in the middle of the street.  Not enough, you cheap fuck.  I give them two 50s.  And finally, I got to give this guy two 50s to get my garbage cans.  Yeah, but that's the point I'm making today.  Now, you feel like you're being held up.  You really do.  It's not a tip anymore.  It's like, this is what you have to do.  That's what it is.  How many names on your list, Kenny, for the work garage?  The work garage. 
[02:27:00]  It's the garage we use on a daily basis.  You have to tip 13 guys, because you park your car every day downstairs.  Yeah, and then they put in bold letters who's the manager, the assistant manager, and the two foremen.  Now, don't you tip them every day when they bring the car?  Yes.  So, that's the tip, but that's the tip.  I tip them when I drop the cars off.  Yeah.  And when we pick them up.  You tip, what, a dollar each, two dollars a day total?  Yeah, each vehicle. 
[02:27:30]  Now, you would say, ah, two dollars a day, but how many days a year are you parking the car?  That's a lot of fucking money extra.  Five days a week.  Five days a week, so that's $10 a week.  Ten bucks a week, and, you know.  $520 a year.  $520.  No, but I work hard, too, you know.  You guys.  Yeah.  You sure do.  You'll find a little something.  I didn't see no envelope from you, so go fuck yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  I didn't see a pamphlet with your picture on it that says big, stupid dope.  Exactly.  Oh. 
[02:28:00]  You want a tip?  Do you open it up?  It's a box of conditioner in it.  Sorry, Kenny.  I always give Kenny a little something.  Yeah, and how many names on my list this year?  I take a $10 bill, and I fold it over, and I go, a little something for you.  There you go.  Hey.  I just handed my pamphlet in to Kenny, because he's going to help me out with this.  You lucked out this year, GH.  There's one less name on the list.  How many names, though?  There's 36 building employees.  That I have to tip.  That I have to tip.  And nine garage employees. 
[02:28:30]  45 guys.  What the fuck?  Thank you.  Now you're involved with the bit.  That's insane.  It's the principle of that.  45 fucking guys I got to tip, and you have to tip.  And each of them get anywhere between $25 up to $200.  Yeah, $25 is the lowest.  $25 is for guys you don't even know.  Holy toll.  I forget.  $25 for guys you don't even know.  Dude, the gym.  See, I use the gym in my building.  I'm like, you don't know by looking at me. 
[02:29:00]  But I mean, I use it a lot, so I tip them, too.  I don't.  It doesn't.  The building tips are a little bit a lot.  Like, there's a lot of people.  But I don't mind.  45 guys, Jimmy.  They make.  They are people I interact with a lot, and they make my life a lot easier.  I honestly do.  I know the guys that I interact with a lot, and I have no problem tipping those guys.  None whatsoever.  So just tip those guys.  The guys that don't interact with you, they're going to get pissed at you, but fuck them because  they don't help you.  It's a whole pamphlet.  There's letters, and there's descriptions, and pictures, and everything. 
[02:29:30]  Dossier?  Basically.  Dossier.  I like to spread it around.  It makes me look good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Easy come, easy go.  I love spending your guys' money.  I went with it.  45 fucking guys?  Really?  Yeah.  45 fucking guys.  That is a lot of people.  That is a lot of people right there.  That's a lot of people.  Well, what do I got?  I guess my mailman, the garbage man, the groundskeeper, and Keith. 
[02:30:00]  And Ang.  Your pool guy?  Well, hey.  Tip him.  He don't come around in the winter.  Let's go to Stryker.  Good for that.  Stryker!  Thank God.  Stryker.  Love the show.  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Hi, Stryker.  Hey.  I forgot.  Two years ago, I forgot to tip the guy that delivers my milk man.  We get home delivery of our dairy stuff every week.  Sure.  Time machine?  Yeah, exactly.  Where are you living in? 
[02:30:30]  What did you do?  Leave some oats for his horse?  What the fuck's rolling, you Stryker?  What the fuck?  Go to the store.  Jesus Christ.  You know what year it is?  Yeah.  My father milks it right into my mouth about cereal.  He holds cereal in his mouth, and the guy jerks an udder off into the other side of his mouth.  How much do you tip your butter churner?  Exactly.  How about the other Amish people that help you put the wall up?  Go ahead.  Joke's over.  Go.  Anyhow, two years ago.  How much do you tip the guy that sells you the animal blood to write on the cave wall? 
[02:31:00]  We'll go as far back in time as you want.  Let's keep going back.  Yes.  Yes.  How many rocks do you tip?  All right.  Good.  Sorry.  Boo.  Go ahead.  You're off.  The guy that sells me the animal blood, I only tip him one rock.  We got it.  Right.  You don't have to elaborate on it.  Let it go.  Anyhow, I forgot to tip the guy, and for the entire next year, my order was fucked up.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, at the end of the year, I got a Christmas card from him.  It's stuck in the box, and just a very subtle reminder to tip the milk man so my order continues 
[02:31:30]  to be in good condition every year.  There you go.  What a fucking douchebag.  Why didn't you just go to the store after that, and he started leaving milk in condoms?  I was going to be like, wait a minute.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  No, but just, you know, I mean, this way I only have to go to the grocery store once  a month.  You know, I mean, I get half my...  It's your problem.  Hey, recluse, what do you do?  Yeah, how far do you live from a grocery store?  Agoraphobic?  Well, yeah, actually, I am.  I'm kind of like Anthony.  You know, I hate going out in public.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  How far do you live, though, from like a supermarket?  I'll go to the liquor store, though.  About 10 miles.  10 lousy miles?  It's actually out of my way.  It's actually out of my way to go to the grocery store.  He's got to hitch up the horses to the wagon.  Jesus.  Another old joke.  Well, that was good.  They never get tiring.  I'm trying to think of one as we speak.  Of course.  Why wouldn't you?  All right.  What happens when you're on your way to the store?  Do you occasionally see a Negro selling jelly?  Hey, Tuma.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, honey. 
[02:32:30]  He's selling honey.  How fucking, how, when Red is dropping those honey jars, they sound like money down the  toilet.  Yeah.  Each one is just, oh, Tuma.  It's like money from home, sir.  Money from home, Joe Buck.  You got a way of saying things regular.  What do you tip the blacksmith, sir?  Uh, I don't remember.  It's a rhetorical question.  It's a joke that's well overstayed.  It's welcome. 
[02:33:00]  No, it hasn't.  Blacksmiths do old jobs, too.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Joe in New York.  Joe.  Good morning.  How do you do, Joe?  What up, Joe?  Opie, my question for you is, how many people live in your building?  So how many tips do these guys get?  It's just Opie is the problem.  Yes.  He has 45 servants.  Opie has serfs.  Serfs.  He's the lord of the manor.  Yes, he is.  He rings a little bell and eight people come in.  Like, they wash his penis like in, uh, in fucking, uh, Coming to America. 
[02:33:30]  There's one who leaves rose petals in front of him behind him.  Yes.  He hates to tip the rose petal girls.  That is a good question, though.  There's got to be at least 200 apartments, I would imagine.  Yeah.  There's close to 50 floors, and some floors have one apartment, but others have at least  four to six.  So there's got to be 200 households.  You know, Kenny?  There's over three.  Over 300?  Yeah.  Absolutely. 
[02:34:00]  Because I saw there's a petition list about, you know, that construction that's going on  in the street.  Oh, is that annoying, too?  The same thing that made fucking annoying.  Yeah?  What?  No, no, no.  You just want to do something with the roads.  It's going to make traffic a lot more.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, yeah, because we got a little...  We got easy right now.  We got a little quiet spot where we live.  That's going to have to go away.  Oh, and they're going to put a big, major fucking thoroughfare through there?  Through our living room.  Oh, that's nice.  It goes through my...  I'm on the 10th floor.  It goes right through.  And you have to tip every driver that drives through your house.  No, basically, you just have to... 
[02:34:30]  It's like a big...  It's going to hurt the apartment value, because they're going to just drive right through,  and you have to wait to cross to go take a shit.  I'm like, it's going to be cold in here, but they're like, yeah, but you'll get  to meet people.  Meet people?  Yeah.  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony's Christmas Edition.  How was your Christmas there, Anthony?  Oh, wonderful.  Were you done with your Christmas, Jimmy?  Nothing?  I didn't open one present.  I didn't see one person, except until I went to the pet dinner.  Did you go see your family or anything like that?  No, I talked to them.  I'm going to see them. 
[02:35:00]  I'm going to bring them out to Atlanta.  And you had no gift to open up?  None.  Are you kidding?  No.  That's okay.  It's my own design.  I didn't buy any either.  Oh, you didn't get anybody?  I'm going to buy some today, my family.  I went the American Express gift card route, whatever you want to say.  And I'm noticing, or I did notice anyway, a lot of gift cards this year by the entire  family.  Like Christmas Eve, my family does Christmas Eve.  Well, the news in a report, they said gift cards were just massive this year. 
[02:35:30]  Massive.  People have reached the point where it's convenient.  It's not like the old gift certificate to some cheesy place.  You could get American Express gift cards or other gift cards that are good in multiple  places.  You go, you use it like a credit card.  It looks like a credit card.  You go there, you use it like a credit card, and it's however much money you have on it.  Where do you get them?  AmericanExpress.com is where I got mine.  And yeah, they get delivered to your house. 
[02:36:00]  You throw them in some cards and hand them out.  And that's what I did.  The most work I did was on Photoshop.  I made something that I could print on the envelopes with everyone's name with a little  shadowing and some nice festive colors and stuff and printed out a bunch of envelopes.  Why the look of disgust, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I was in the Christmas spirit.  Sounds like it.  And that's what I gave out.  Next year, I'm just going to do some wheeling and dealing.  What do you mean?  You're going to give me a gift card? 
[02:36:30]  I'm going to give you a gift card.  Are we square?  Same amount.  We're good?  We're good.  Okay.  Let's not worry about each other.  How about me and you?  Me and you?  You're going to give me a gift card?  I'm going to...  Okay.  We're done, right?  That's it.  That's it.  Done, right?  And then all I have to do is buy a gift from my mom, and I'm good to go.  Then we had a big controversy over my mom's gift because my mother, for some reason, does  not want to leave the 1800s.  The digital to her is some evil thing.  I talk to her all the time about things like the Internet Movie Database, imdb.com. 
[02:37:00]  You go there if you want to find out anything about movies.  My mother, one of the biggest movie buffs ever, loves going to the movies, loves old movies,  new movies, just loves it.  And I tell her about imdb because there's constantly times where you go, who the fuck was the actor  that was in that movie?  IMdb, you got the answer in a second.  She insists, and every year, she gets it, the big, thick, Leonard Maltin book of movies. 
[02:37:30]  Like, you're going through this big encyclopedia of movies to find answers and trying to cross-reference  things.  I mean, you could just pop it on because she will not get a computer.  We have tried getting her a computer.  Maybe she reads it on the bowl.  Well, you know, a laptop fits there in the bathroom, let me tell you.  Yeah, I don't think she reads it on the bowl, and I don't want that image conjured up either.  I'm only saying, play devil's advocate, why would you want a big book?  Sometimes I spend hours on the bowl. 
[02:38:00]  I like a big, thick book to peruse.  A lot of people may do that.  That's not out of the realm.  I could read my phone on the book.  It's very handy.  I could read my phone on the bowl.  On the bowl, okay.  On the book.  All right, a flub market.  No, no, no.  I just, I wasn't sure what you meant.  You mean you said it while you read your phone?  All right.  Yeah.  There's plenty of things to read on the bowl.  And my mother isn't reading it on the bowl.  You messed up, too, or was that?  No.  Did I?  Yeah.  You did.  I don't know.  I'm a son about reading a phone. 
[02:38:30]  No, he said reading his phone.  Yeah.  I know, but you don't mind.  I do read the phone.  You can read the phone these days.  That's what you do in this modern digital age that my mother is just not, she wants no  part of.  So years ago, we tried to even get her that drive.  Remember when web TV was out?  Yeah.  It's like, look, it's on the TV.  Just so you can get a fucking email.  So we can send you a picture or something.  So it doesn't have to be, put a photo in the mail with a stamp and mail it to her.  She wants nothing to do with it.  They tried getting her a digital camera a couple of years ago that plugs right into a 
[02:39:00]  docking station on the thing and photos come out.  Yeah, I got you.  No computer involved.  I don't, ooh, no, I, yeah, no, no.  So this year, uh, uh, they got her a digital camera.  She wants no part of it.  So I got the, and I start a big controversy because, uh, me and my girlfriend got her a  Canon 35 millimeter camera, got a regular film camera.  And now that started because we didn't, you know, to talk. 
[02:39:30]  It's like, oh, we got her a digital camera.  Now she's not even going to use the digital one because the big controversy on the gift  giving for a mom's camera.  But that was about the biggest controversy.  Aside from, uh, the present my brother gave me, which, uh, probably one of the best Christmas  presents.  Wait, wait, before you go there.  Yeah.  So which, uh, camera is she going to use?  So she looks at me and goes, I'm using the digital camera.  Of course.  I'm using it.  I totally undermined their attempt to get her up to speed. 
[02:40:00]  And really fast, because I have a thought before you move on.  Yeah.  Who else try to buy their, like, parents just a simple DVD player?  Nah.  And, and, and your folks cannot figure out how to use a DVD?  Where does the tape go?  No, it's, it's not tape anymore.  It's, it's DVD.  And here's the.  Oh, I don't.  Their arms go up.  Ooh, I, ooh, ooh, ooh, I.  It is a nightmare trying to teach your parents, uh, how to, how to work a DVD player.  How do you rewind the DVD?  Because they can't comprehend the whole menu thing. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  You know, they just want to be able to push play and the movie to start.  And, and that should be a feature on these damn things.  But they're not.  My mom cannot get past the fucking menu.  And she can't, she can't grasp the concept that there's a menu and you got to move the  fucking thing around to play the movie and what have you.  How did they get to be where they are in life?  How did they get so old?  That part of their brain doesn't work.  It's, it's bizarre.  I've sat down with my mom.  I'm, I'm talking about a DVD player.  I actually bought her a while ago. 
[02:41:00]  Mm-hmm.  And I'm still trying to teach her how to use it.  And I know I'm not alone in this.  The whole menu thing just, she, she just wants to throw the stupid movie in and push play  and go.  Yeah.  And most players, you just cannot do that.  They still have VCRs, videotape.  And she gets, uh, for, for her birthday or Christmas gets DVDs.  And she'll open it up like, oh, what's, uh, what's this?  It's a DVD.  Oh, the one of the, and like, oh, one of those DVDs. 
[02:41:30]  Like, you're talking about, you just gave her some fucking, uh, a spacecraft.  They're scared.  That's why older people don't want to use it.  They're afraid.  That it's not, that they can't comprehend it.  It's overwhelming.  The digital language is overwhelming.  That life has moved so far from them that they are obsolete.  Yes.  Is that what it is?  Picture walking into a 60-year calculus class.  That's how they feel.  We're onto something with this, uh, parent thing, though.  Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, gummy boobs.  Hi, Dennis.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, not Dennis.  Oh.  Jesus.  Don't fucking insult me. 
[02:42:00]  I can't get by it.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I just want to say, Dennis, go fuck yourself.  Anyway, going back to what you were talking about.  Yeah.  I find it amazing that my father can fly an airplane.  Yeah.  But he can't stop his VCR from flashing 12 o'clock.  Yeah, he flies an airplane, huh?  And he can't work the VCR features.  He's just like, VCR.  I got him a DVD two years ago.  He must have called me five times.  How do I work this again?  I gave up.  I gave up.  And my mom's no dummy, but she cannot grasp the whole DVD player with the menu and having  to hit play here and then pausing, and she just doesn't get it. 
[02:42:30]  It's a fear of the overwhelming nature of the digital age.  That's all it is.  I didn't say that.  Dennis told me.  Ah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dan in Chicago.  That's got to be true.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  What's up, Dennis?  Hello.  I just did the ultimate, guys.  I got my parents a TiVo for Christmas.  And you feel good about yourself when you're buying these big gifts for your parents going,  oh, I finally got a gift they're really going to enjoy.  What happened there, Dan?  My mom is concerned that the neighbors are going to be upset when she hits pause. 
[02:43:00]  Because she's going to somehow control network television.  That's a hot one.  So, you know, if you guys are watching, and in the middle of something, everything just  pauses, it's my mom.  It's your mother.  Yeah.  They don't understand it.  Like, the computer thing.  I wanted to tell my mother to get a computer.  We were going to get her a laptop.  Nice and easy.  It's not a big intimidating thing.  So she could get email. 
[02:43:30]  She doesn't understand.  And then I don't call for a while, and she's like, oh, you know, you haven't called in a  while.  Get a fucking computer.  I'll email you.  You'll get pictures.  You can get video.  All of a sudden, I'll email you a video.  Nothing.  Your mom could come on Pal Talk.  She could come on Pal Talk and look at luscious breasts if she wants to.  Nothing.  She wants no part of it.  She goes, I don't know.  I'm afraid I'll just get addicted to it and sit there all day.  No, you're not.  You're petrified of it.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  And get your parents big gifts that they can't handle.  I got my mother a Yankee hat and my father a pocket pussy.  That's a nice gift to give your parents.  There you go.  Cleaning instructions?  He doesn't use it.  He's an older gentleman.  He puts it in the car.  He holds change in it.  Jim?  It's Dad.  How do you clean this?  Could you come over and clean this thing for me?  Brad?  Morning, Big Dick Santa.  Hi.  Yeah, man.  Pretty much my mom, but my fucking total douche of a stepdad and iPod. 
[02:44:30]  Now I'm stuck hooking the thing up for it together.  And secondly, I get a list of songs that I get to download for them.  Oh, that's so nice of you.  Yeah, it is.  But I'm pretty much just going to rig the little fucker with a bunch of fuck my fucking cock  and O&A jingles, so.  You sure?  My fucking jack.  Download gay porn clips and put his favorite song titles.  So he'll put it on and just hear fucking one man saying, you know, whatever another man  says in gay porn, I almost stepped into a bear trap here to go, firing out quotes. 
[02:45:00]  Love you, boy.  Punk out.  An iPod is very rough to get for somebody.  Yeah.  Like an older person that has no clue.  Yeah.  Because then they have to learn how to download the songs for it.  It's just a catastrophe.  My parents asked for weird stuff.  They do?  Yeah.  My father asked for, like, the Harry Potter videos and some lubricant.  It's not that weird.  What a fucking Harry Potter. 
[02:45:30]  The whole Harry Potter collection, some KY, that's it.  Well, he didn't know the name.  He just said, I want the movies with that Potter kid.  Bring me film starring that Potter boy.  I'll be home this Christmas Passed out on the floor  Uh-oh, there's a real good chance I pissed my pants 
[02:46:00]  Get more pants  Out of the pants brawl  Christmas Eve  Will find me  Rocking out  To sticks 
[02:46:30]  As I flog  My knob  To the J.  Cruel  Catalog  Cause the video  Store  Closed  At  Six  I'll be home for Christmas  Knocking back some rules  Scrooge  Scrooge  Knut  Like I got a 
[02:47:00]  Pony  Kick  And I'm cranking my  The crew  Be  Boop  Boop  Boop  Boop  Boop  Boop  Cricket  To  Be  Will find me  Polishing my  Horn  Cause I'll be home alone this Christmas  Drinking it to porn  I'll be home alone this Christmas  Striking it to porn  I won't be all alone  On this Christmas 
[02:47:30]  Cause I'll be jerking it to porn  Well I tell you what  Maybe we'll have ourselves a little Christmas  Right here  Come on everyone  Get around  String up the lights and light up the tree  We're gonna make some revelry 
[02:48:00]  Spirits are high so I can tell  It's Christmas time in hell  Demons are nicer as you pass them by  There's lots of demon toys to buy  The snow is falling and all is well  It's Christmas time in hell  There goes Jeffrey Dahmer  We're the first of Christmas ham  After he has sex with it  He'll eat up all he can  And there goes John F. Kennedy  Carolling with his son  Reunited for the holidays  God bless us everyone  Everybody has a happy glow 
[02:48:30]  Let's dance in blood  And pretend it's snow  Even mouth say tongue is under the spell  It's Christmas time in hell  Adolf, here's a present for you  Look  God cast me down from heaven's door  To rule in hell forevermore  But now I'm kinda glad that I fell  Cause it's Christmas time in hell  Here's a rack to hang the stockings on  We still have to shop for Genghis Khan  Michael Landon's hair looks swell 
[02:49:00]  It's Christmas time in hell  There's Princess Diana  Holding burning mistletoe  Over poor Jean Siskel's edges  Just watch his weenie grow  For one day we all stop burning  And the flames are not so thick  All the screaming and the torture stops  As we wait for all St. Nick  So string up the lights and light up the tree  We're damned for all eternity  But for just one day  All is well  It's Christmas time in hell  Gather close together and make it quick 
[02:49:30]  We gotta make room for Andy Dick  Wake his mother and ring the bell  It's Christmas time  Christmas time  Christmas time  Christmas time  It's Christmas  Heart in hell  We're in Christmas movie house  But I gotta give props to Ron and Fez  They have a 
[02:50:00]  Propellers  I don't even know if it's a contest  But they're trying to come up with brand new Christmas songs  Have you heard them doing this?  Yes I have  Completely original  Just have people make up Christmas songs  Right  And send them in  Because they're basically saying it's time for some new Christmas songs  Some new classics  And I gotta tell you  I'm taking a chance here  But I don't care  What the hell  Who knows how much longer we got on regular radio  They played a song by Sleeves  Have you heard his song yet?  You're a big Sleeves fan 
[02:50:30]  You don't like the Sleeves?  No I'm kinda mixed  I think some of his stuff is genius  I'm a big Sleeves fan  Some of his stuff sucks  I'm a big big Sleeves fan  This is what Ron and Fez is doing this?  Yeah did you hear this song yet?  No  Sleeves did a song called Christmas Song  And I can't get this damn thing out of my head  Does it sound like the mod theme?  Apparently that one gets stuck  So I asked  It's a short song  I asked Ronnie B  You know permission to play it on our show  He said yes  You know  Get Sleeves some more attention  So this is Sleeves 
[02:51:00]  It's called Christmas Song  It's only a couple minutes  I wanna see Ann if you like this  Okay?  Sure  Jimmy you too  Yeah  I have a feeling  Ann's gonna go  Eh  Jimmy's gonna go  I need it for my iPod  It's a catchy little song  Ooh  That's my guess right here  I was feeling pretty good  For la la la la  Taking my time on the la la la la  Snowfall down in the la la la la 
[02:51:30]  Everybody singing like la la la la  Dacking on a heart with the la la la la  Making my way to the la la la la la  I like to drink a little beer  At the ending of the day  And go walking in the town 
[02:52:00]  Be like a million miles away  Not as low as legacy  Like a sand above the beach  The lights popping in the trees  The people shining in the street  And the people in the light  All the children in the light  Singing holy, holy night  I was feeling pretty good 
[02:52:30]  La la la la  Taking my time on the la la la la  Snowfall down in the la la la la  Everybody singing like la la la la  Dacking on a heart with the la la la la  Making my way to the la la la la  La la la la la la la la la la  La la la la 
[02:53:00]  I like to sit out on the pier  And look across the bay  I don't think about a thing  I feel a million miles away  Like I'm floating from the sky  Like a storm  A falling stone  Then I'm spinning through the trees  And I'm shining in the room  For all the people in the light 
[02:53:30]  And all the children in the light  Singing holy, holy night  What do you think?  I liked it better when it was Grey Wolf doing it  When he sang with the pan flute  You don't like it?  That sucked so bad  Dude, dude  Let me be  I'm being completely honest with you  I'm not even doing this for a bit  Right  That sucked so bad I got douche chills  What don't you like about it? 
[02:54:00]  The la la la la  Heading for the la la la la  It's catchy  No, it's not  That part is catchy  So is AIDS  I hate it  Jimmy?  The song itself was  The fa la la la didn't make sense to me  Like I understood what he was doing  He's going to the la la la la  What is it?  I don't know  And he's going to have a drink on the la la  What is the la la?  What's the la la la?  Say it 
[02:54:30]  A llama?  Is he stuttering through llama?  Lotto?  He wants to play lotto?  He stepped in a la la la log?  What does that mean?  I like it  I don't know why  The song itself is okay  It's catchy as hell  I don't even like the song itself  It's this droning friggin funeral  Sounding just a droning  But it's cool  It's like a  Redundant monotonous mess  He's got that weird like Leonard Cohen feel  His voice is horrid  I hate his voice 
[02:55:00]  The lyrics aren't profound or anything  It's just  It sucks  It sounds like any douchebag  Trying to come up with a  A horrible song  Well it kind of makes me feel like a la la la la  Yeah  Yeah  What is it?  Yeah  What is a la la la?  It means Christmas is coming what?  Yeah  There's a lot of fa la la la la la songs  Our new president's a la la la la  He could use it  I mean you can  Strategically put that in  Spudge Buckley used to say  La la la la la la  I don't know 
[02:55:30]  Yeah  I tried to share  I liked it  I normally enjoy your music picks  You're batting about 8.50 with me on music picks  Usually have very good ones  La la la la la la la la  Obscure and weird taste in music  I have to be  I played all the stuff everyone knows and loves way too much on the radio  So I had to, you know  You had to go out and discover other stuff, other music  I love Leonard Cohen and that very creepy vibe  La la la la  La la la 
[02:56:00]  Bonnie, DC, how are you?  Hey guys  I called the backup  Sorry, it's early  And I'm a smoker  Sorry  I called the backup Opie because I don't want to hurt your cause  But it actually made me choke up almost by in my car  I loved it  Maybe it's a chick saw  Maybe it is  Maybe it's a chick saw  And what the hell do I know?  I hope you're riding and you hit a la la la la  Ditch  I didn't find that catchier ending  I found it too  There wasn't any moment in there that was like  Oh wow, this kind of, you know 
[02:56:30]  Hits me where it's like  If I heard this a couple of times  I would like this part of the song at least  There was nothing in there  I hate the la la la la the most  Let's go to Amanda in White Plains  I gotta tell you  The phones, every single one is lit  Half of them love it  Or not, I shouldn't say love it, but like it  And the other half hate it  Amanda, I mean it's right down the middle  Amanda, White Plains  Hey, what's going on?  Hey  I love it  I thought it was great  Two chicks 
[02:57:00]  It might be a chick song  Two chicks  Let's go to a guy  John in Jersey  John  Hey, what's up?  All I have to say is  Enough with the la la la la  We get it  And what the hell is a hogs neck  That he's sucking on?  I didn't get any of the songs  No  It's trying to be profound  I guess  And  La la la  To me it's like  Yeah  Head to the la la la la  What is the la la la?  Is that like a 7-Eleven?  Let's play it again  It's like a Nambla meeting  Going to the la la la  Going to the la la la la 
[02:57:30]  Whatever  Wait, can we try to figure out  What the la la la  Can we stop at each one  And figure out what the la la la la  What is the la la la la  Hold on, Stunt Tool is saying  That we have to take a break  We have to take a la la la  La la la la  Gotta pay some la la la las  It ain't gonna work again today  I'm sorry  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony's Christmas edition  La la la la  La la la  La la la  O.B. and Anthony  La la la  La la la la  La la la  La la la 
[02:58:00]  La la la  I thought I would bring a song to the show  Ron and Fez are doing a great contest  I don't know if it's an official contest  But basically they're trying to come up with brand new Christmas songs  Because we're all sick of all the Christmas songs you hear every year, right?  Yeah, same ones  There hasn't been a new Christmas classic in many, many years  And most of the ones Ron and Fez are playing, you know, suck  But this one song by Sleeves I really liked  And I thought we should bring it to our show  And Jimmy hates it  Anthony absolutely hates it 
[02:58:30]  Jimmy doesn't hate it, right?  See, that's  Do you hate it, Jimmy?  No, but I don't like it  He doesn't like it  I cannot even describe how much I hate that song  Like if that was a song that was on the radio  Yeah  I would hit the button to turn it off within one note  I hear the emotion  I'll eliminate that song in one note  You hear the emotion coming from the guy  Emotion, first of all, there's no Christmassy sound to it  You want to know more about this guy after he sings a song like that  No Christmassy sound to it at all 
[02:59:00]  Drinking his beers, la la la la  La la la  And then he goes to the la la la la  Yeah  What is it?  He's  It's the Christmas season  It stinks  It doesn't sound Christmassy  Like deck the halls with boughs of holly  Fa la la la la la la  That's fine because the la la's in that are just like you're singing  This guy makes the la la  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  Why is that fine?  What does that mean?  Deck the halls with boughs of holly  You're taking a lot of holly  Some boughs of it  They don't even sell holly anymore 
[02:59:30]  Deck the halls with it  F is holly  That's how old the song is  Holy stinks  That's why you need songs by sleeves  I think I have holly on my mantle  Exactly  In my house  I've got holly there  You need like new Christmas songs  Yeah, but this  This ain't it  Huh?  This ain't it  La la la la  You said it before, Opie  This is Jeff B. from Austin  He writes  Ant can't handle anything sentimental or introspective  Shut your mouth  I can too  It's because his soul was smashed against the wall along with a wad of pasta 
[03:00:00]  Sleeves rules  La la la la  Sleeves may rule  Look, I'm not saying the guy might not rule  La la la la la  That song stinks  Well, can we hear a little bit?  Because I forgot what it sounds like  La la la  Did you?  Yeah, watch  Thanks, Jimmy  This song  If you love it or hate it  This will be something you'll be humming along at work today  I'm sorry  It's sticking your head like when you see  It's gonna happen  A dead person's head twisted off from a car wreck  Same thing  You can't forget that either  It makes me kind of  It doesn't make it pleasant  It kind of makes me happy  What, the head on the 
[03:00:30]  No, the la la la la  It brings you back to being a little kid  And, you know, discovering how cool Christmas is  Now it just sucks Christmas  We all know that  It brings you back a little bit  Sleeves  Christmas song  I was feeling pretty good  La la la la  Taking my time on the la la la  I'm taking my time on the la la la  What is that?  You don't have to know what it is  Yes, you do  What is that?  A new bus? 
[03:01:00]  A new train in Los Angeles?  On the la la la la  What is it?  You don't need your lyrics to make sense  It's an emotion you feel  For a Christmas song?  It better make sense  La la la la la  It better make sense  This  It sucks  Why?  It sucks  There's like  All hell's breaking loose out there  In the real world  And Sleeves has given us a little hope  With his la la la la  Hope  Hope  Hope what?  Did he think some words?  Just getting sentimental  And remembering happier times 
[03:01:30]  You know  Around this fine Christmas season  He's going to  Alright  It's a peppy song  I was feeling pretty good  For la la la la  Taking my time on the la la la  Snow falling down in the la la la  Right there  What is snow falling down in the la la la la  In the la la la  What does that mean?  What is the la la?  The snow can fall down in what?  I don't need to know what the la la is  I do  I do too  You don't really need to know 
[03:02:00]  The snow's falling down  It should even be the snow  Look, look  I'll even be ridiculous  And go with this for a second  Alright  How about the snow's falling down  On the la la la la  Yeah  Why?  It's going into a la la la la  It's falling into that  What does that mean?  It doesn't need a meaning  It does  It just gives you a little  Like emotion  It gives you  I like it  Snow's falling down in the la la la hood  That's all I can think of  Yeah  It just falls in there  La la la la  La la la  You'll be humming it all day 
[03:02:30]  You watch  When you start humming it  You call me up and say  You know  And curse me out  I don't care  It's la la lazy  He didn't come up with words  No  So he threw la la in there  It's catchy  No  He could have come up with words  Real words that rhymed  But it's too much la la work  Bad musicians like Sleeves  Say la la la la  Because they can't think of lyrics  Of la la lyrics  You're exactly right  That's Heather on Long Island  Thank you  I disagree Heather  Heather is absolutely right  Everybody's singing like 
[03:03:00]  La la la la  Decking on the halls  With the la la la la  What?  Making my way  It's far like  You're decking the halls  With Holly  Not la la la  What?  You don't throw  La la la in the hallway  Why not?  What is it?  You're just throwing around  The Christmas spirit  I've never bought  A la la la la in my life  How do you know?  Because I know  La la la la  La la la  La la la  This guy's head should be 
[03:03:30]  La la la  Lobbed off  I like to drink a little beer  At the end of the day  Roll ball and in the town  Be like a million miles away  Not as snowy like a steam  Like a sand above the beach  The lights walking in the trees 
[03:04:00]  The people shining in the street  And the people in the light  All the children in the light  Singing holy, holy night  Didn't that just give you a chill?  No  Yeah, it certainly did  What kind, Ant?  Of the douche variety, you ass  I got a little chill there  I don't even know what he's  I got a little chill in my la la la la  I don't even know what he's singing about  But you know what?  You know what?  I don't need  Da da da douche 
[03:04:30]  I don't need everything spelled out for me  There's a lot going on in this song  I can spell it out  L.A. L.A.  Repeat  La la la la  I got a little chill there  It's droning  Fricking a little beer at the end of the day  Come on, who doesn't like that?  A little beer at the end of the day  After your day of hell  Why?  Then put on one bourbon, one scotch, one beer  And at least that's an up-peppy song  You know what it's about?  It's not  The landlord is looking for  He doesn't say la la la la  The landlord's looking for  The landlord is looking  He's out drinking 
[03:05:00]  The landlord is on his heels  There's plenty of beer drinking songs  This is all about  Eins, zwei, drei, sphere  There's beer drinking songs all over  This is all  There it is  Here it is, see?  He is telling a story  No la la la la  Yeah, but the la la la la  You're taking a break from  By the way  From what's going on around you  I hate this song, too  Yeah, this thing stinks  It's terrible  We get it, you're drunk  George Thurgood's terrible  Seek help  Takes five minutes to get to the hook  One bird  All right, thank you  Exactly  I said, look, man 
[03:05:30]  La la la la, man  Let me get back to sleeves  And the la la la la  La la la  Huh?  Yeah  Are you liking it?  Second  Stump Brain likes it?  Ugh, I don't want to like anything you like  That sucks  I want someone cool to like this with me  Someone cool  Wow  Danny, you like it?  I consider you cool  You know what?  I like sleeve stuff  Some of it's weird  Yes  But I like it  La la la la la la  And you don't need to know what he's singing about 
[03:06:00]  You kind of get a feel that there's a lot going on here  I've got a communique from Dr. Steve  All right  Who's got his own thing  He goes, I think la la la la is just artistic license for et cetera  But then he goes, I think he's making the point that Christmas is so stereotypical for all of us  That you can say la la la la and we all get the same images invoked  Wow, nice  I like that  So like, you know, the la la la la is the store that you go into to do your Christmas shopping 
[03:06:30]  The la la la la is where the snow is falling into  Which is what?  A garbage pail in the street?  Sometimes the snow falls in that  Whatever  In your boot?  I would love to talk to sleeves  I don't like it though  I love to talk to sleeves about the song, but I hear he's a weirdo  Is he really weird?  It's a little strange  I love the guy, I want to know more about him  Randy needs to gain more weight  La la la la  She's the biggest teeth I've ever seen on a human 
[03:07:00]  I know  She looks like a praying mantis  La la la la  Randy's got teeth like a la la la  I'm pretty good  La la la la  See, I was feeling good  Fa la la la la  Fa la la la  Because the Christmas season just knocks you down  And you're like, ugh, I've got to deal with this crap again  And he's simplifying  It's like, you know what?  I feel pretty good for the la la la la  He's saying the first fa la la la la  Doesn't bother me  Because I'm feeling pretty good 
[03:07:30]  He's saying Christmas  Right  But then after that, it just bugged me  Then after that, it bothered me  It went on to la  Oh, Cody from Wisconsin  Suck it  Wait, hold on  What's wrong?  I'm tired of people  It's just a Christmas song  What did Cody say?  Well, Cody will say it himself  Go ahead, Cody  Yeah, I think it's just too deep for Ant to understand  It's too deep for me  Yes, leaves is much too deep for me, man  He doesn't like something where somebody's got to think of something

I don't know  Anthony, why do you have such a problem on la la la la  When the police had a song  The do-do-do-da-da-da-da  I hated the police  Hey  I'm not a police fan either  What's wrong with the police?  I only liked that one song  Walking on the Moon? 
[03:10:00]  No  Roxanne?  Synchronicity 2?  I can't stand losing you  That's mediocre  I can't stand losing  I can't stand losing  I hated the repetition in any police song  Even that one  But there was just  There was a very cool harmonic thing they did in that song  That was very good during the chorus  And that's why I liked it  You didn't like the police?  I didn't like the police  Little spirits in the material world?  No  It was all just  Rehumanized?  They were so repetitive in every song 
[03:10:30]  It's like, alright, we get it  I was a big police fan  Something he likes walking on the moon  I know my legs  You don't like that little reggae beat they got going at times?  Walking on the moon  Walking on the moon  Yeah, you're walking on the moon  We get it  Everything  Ben's too big without you  Come on  You don't have to repeat the same line 80 times  See, I'm not even going with the hits  I'm going with some of the deeper stuff for the peeps out there  Yeah  Let's go to Dominic in Virginia  He's got a little something on the  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  I can't  I can't 
[03:11:00]  I can't stand losing my hair  Oh, that guy needs some credit  Alright, that's Hans  Yeah, but you know what?  In all fairness  In all fairness, what guy can?  Every guy talks about their stupid hair  And what's going on with it  Dominic, Virginia  You don't think I'm  You don't think I'm paying close attention  To what's going on with Ant and his hair?  I'm about two years behind him  And if this works, I'm like  I'm right there  I'm the guinea pig 
[03:11:30]  No kidding, you are  La, la, la, la  Hey, that's good  La, la, la, la  Shove your quick break up your ass  La, la, la, la  Put that break in your la, la, la  Dominic in Virginia  We're wrapping up the show  First of all, I didn't thank Ant for a hits guy  But secondly, Dr. Steve kind of took my thunder  I think you guys are kind of reading into it a little too much  It's just, you know, don't read too much in the fall, la, la 
[03:12:00]  Just substitute Frank  Whatever he meant by it  You know, it could make perfect sense  What about his voice?  It's very unique  I don't like his voice  I don't like the droning of the song  La, la, la  It's familiar Christmas sounds, you know, included in his sound  And I just, you kind of have to read a little deeper  Familiar Christmas, it's a droning  I dare say  Funeral dirge  I dare say he's a genius  With his work  What?  I dare say he's a genius  Where did he fit on that English list? 
[03:12:30]  La, la, la  He's between the cartoon guy  And the guy that invented Preparation H  The guy that invented ShamWow  Douche  Let's go to Melissa  I'll give you one hand  I've been stacking the deck a little bit  I've been stacking the deck  I'll give you one  I'll give you one  I'll give you one hand  I'll give you one hand  Melissa Jersey, go ahead  Hey Anthony, I gotta agree with you  That song is absolutely horrendous  I have never heard a song as bad as that 
[03:13:00]  Isn't it terrible?  There's no catchy hook to it  The la, la, la  It's the catch  No, it's not the catch  You can't get catchier than that  No, yes you can  La, la, la  Believe me  Chef, wow  All right, ladies and gentlemen  Listen up and listen up again  I'm going to sing you  A lucky roll song  Which is called  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Once upon a time 
[03:13:30]  Chris Cringle stowed  He beat up every part  From the house  He used his screwdriver  To give me the lock  After that  He didn't jump into the  Strolling car  And started up the motor  He drove away the  Strolling car  In half a suit  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Was a car thief  Chris Cringle spread down 
[03:14:00]  What's bulletin  Out and in the  Haunted tree  Looking for the curse  He was fired  When he was fired  When the Chicago police officers  Spotted the stolen memory  As it soon passed them  They turned on their siren  Then they went  After the beat of  Solon Mowry  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle 
[03:14:30]  Was a car thief  Chris Cringle  Chicken  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle  Chris Cringle 
[03:15:00]  Chris Cradle  We'll be right back. 
[03:15:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:16:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:16:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:17:00]  Although you went to town and sucked some semen down, you're still a virgin in the eyes of God.  There was no room at the inn when Mary and Joseph did arrive.  But they were so very tired, you see, and Mary had to offer a bribe.  Since she had no money, how would she pay for a place to sleep? 
[03:17:30]  Gabriel appeared to Mary and told her not to wait.  Mary, cause you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin, Mary.  You can suck all the dick you want and still be the mother of Christ.  If there's no room at the inn, then it's not considered a sin to suck some dick to get a room for the night. 
[03:18:00]  Then three wise men did appear, bearing gifts of myrrh and such.  They said that they had followed a star and missed a woman's touch.  Mary thought she might pleasure them, but could not take them too bad.  But again, Gabriel appeared to her, and this is what he said.  You can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin, Mary. 
[03:18:30]  You can suck all the dick you want and everyone that hangs in the nation.  Felicia ain't no sin, gonna blow those three wise men.  And you'll still be a virgin cause there was no penetration.  So you can suck all the dick you want and still be a virgin, Mary.  The donkey and the ox and the lambs and even the little drummer boy.  People will remember your name quick. 
[03:19:00]  They'll say, damn, that bitch could suck a good dick.  Cause sucking dick brings peace on earth and joy.  Cause sucking dick brings peace on earth and joy.  Mary, Mary, suck that dick.  Wow.  Yes, Jimmy, what happened?  I heard some screaming from the office.  I just spent the last, say, six minutes in the office watching a copy of the Star Wars 
[03:19:30]  holiday special.  Again, if I've seen it, I was fucking eight when it came out.  I don't remember it.  Yeah.  And I'm going to say, I'm going to include scat videos and animal fucking.  It's the least entertaining thing I've ever seen.  Ever.  And it's, it's so great to me because somebody had to approve this.  They watched this.  Like, Lucas did this.  Yep.  And they watched it.  And it's got the fucking, the little fluffy, try to market them characters, which is why 
[03:20:00]  I hate him.  Right.  The little baby Chewbacca, Chewbacca's little son.  His fucking cunt of a wife and his fucking old man father.  Old mangy father.  And the first four minutes, there's a hand solo introduction with, with, with Chewie.  And then there's fucking four minutes of just Chewbacca family noise.  Grunting.  Just.  Four minutes straight.  And then for the daughter bring home her boyfriend, the father's, you know. 
[03:20:30]  And then like they're throwing in stock footage from the movie of Imperial cruisers.  And, and then they put Han Solo and Chewbacca in this poorly made, uh, set of the, um, flight  deck of the Falcon.  And it just looks really bad.  And they all, I guess, Lucas had to have somehow, I'm thinking, blackmailed them into doing that. 
[03:21:00]  Like, why would they do that?  Because it was probably, at the time, when was that done?  Oh, it was right after the first one.  Um, 1998.  Oh, okay.  Oh, 98.  That would explain.  Because, um, because, uh, Mark Hamill has prostate cancer in it.  And, uh, you know what it is?  It probably was before the second one.  They were like, let's ride the success out.  They didn't know they had an empire.  Guys, you want to do that?  Yeah.  You know, I wasn't even thinking that. 
[03:21:30]  They really weren't anybody back then.  All of them.  78.  They're just agreeing to do anything.  And it, it is so incredibly bad.  They're, the special guests in it.  And did you see the very beginning where they go, it's the Star Wars Christmas special.  Like every announcer in the 70s had a yell during the intro to these things.  With special guest, Bea Arthur.  No, Beatrice Arthur.  Beatrice Arthur.  She's in it.  Yeah.  Jefferson Starship. 
[03:22:00]  No shit.  Art Carney.  Art Carney is in it.  Hey there, chewy boy.  Ugh.  What about C-3PO, Hawking Toys after the credits?  Oh, I don't remember that.  I didn't see that.  There's like toy commercials.  There's the actual commercials that played during it too.  I have to get it.  So that's kind of cool and nostalgic to look at.  You know, I think there's, I can't believe I ate the whole thing or some legs pantyhose or some stupid thing.  I can't believe it.  There's not short shorts. 
[03:22:30]  One of those.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  With the chicks walking down the stairs.  Yeah.  You've got short short.  It's Heather Mills' version.  There's not short short.  We hear you.  We've got, you've got short shorts.  Great.  Use narrative.  Fit your twats.  Use it on that 70s fucking muff.  Your pubis isn't fucking blowing hair out the sides of your legs.  Your fucking, your fucking Mons, Mons, whatever it's called.  Mons Venus.  Mons Venus.  Your labia majora.  Is not fucking poofing hair out, you fucking 70s chimp. 
[03:23:00]  We know.  You want to hear the opening scene with Han?  Dude, I want to hear the, when they introduce the fucking people playing and they have Chewbacca's family's names.  Yeah.  I almost bit Sam's ear.  Do we have the opening credits?  Not on that CD.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, it better be one second.  I say a half a second.  You're too generous.  A quarter. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  Get it in a quarter second.  All right.  In the meantime, we got this.  All right.  Thank you.  I can't get enough of her.  I want everybody singing the hook at home, by the way.  Make sure you sing.  Don't ruin it here.  I want to hear her.  I'm watching you on Pal Talk.  Sing the hook.  Is enough enough?  I saw the sign. 
[03:24:00]  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  I'll be able to.  And then she tries to get all sexy at the end.  They have to go,  I saw the swines.  Wind is blowing.  It's like she's on the fucking,  the wing of that fucking Virgin Airline to try to land. 
[03:24:30]  Holy shit.  She's all nervous.  Popping her peas.  Breathing heavily into that shitty mic.  I just can't get enough of that, though.  I saw the swine.  All right, we can do the opening scene as we get that other piece of audio.  Oh, it is fucking bad.  We'll start here, and then we'll go backwards when we get it, okay?  Dude, it's so bad.  Opening scene with Han.  No, this is going forward.  This is correct.  This is the right order.  That was, Han's scene was first.  No, I understand, but we want to get audio, 
[03:25:00]  the intro of the whole show we don't have yet.  Right.  Oh, okay.  I thought that came after.  Like, I thought this was a cold open, as they said.  Oh, okay.  Is it?  I could be wrong, but I just wanted to throw a show.  It's got to be in chronological order.  So far, I think, I saw the Han solo first, then the intro came after it.  Here's Han and Chewbacca.  That's it.  I'm turning back.  I know your family's waiting.  I know it's an important day.  All right, we'll give it a try. 
[03:25:30]  I said short coordinates.  I won't jump, Bob.  I'll get you back there in time, pal.  Trust me.  Our only hope now is I'll run that Imperial Garbage Scout, though.  I'm going to light speed.  Douche chills.  That's the spirit.  You'll be celebrating life day before you know it.  Stand by.  Here's for saying goodbye to our unpleasant friends.  Oh, what?  I don't know, but I know I should have heard someone say weak-chinned idiot to describe the 
[03:26:00]  fucking director.  Yeah.  Dude, it's fucking life day.  And hence his acting's not even done.  What does that even mean?  Nice, I'm so glad I'm your person like you.  Dreaming you are to bother me.  You're not the one for me.  That's too bad.  Enough, enough.  I saw the sign. 
[03:26:30]  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  That's all the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  How good do you belong?  She starts going breathy on us.  It gets funnier every time you hear it.  All right, back to the Star Wars holiday special. 
[03:27:00]  And thank you to whoever got me my plain fat-free yogurt that is vanilla-flavored.  Oh.  Here's the two minutes of Wookiees, of the Wookiees talking.  Oh, God.  Dude, if you don't want to fucking cave somebody's head in.  What happened?  What?  What's going on?  What happened?  Oh, no.  Who told you to come in?  Why?  Eric, why?  Ask Eric, why?  Yogurt. 
[03:27:30]  Eric.  Who decided that they should disrupt the show?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Of course it would be E-Rock again.  Eric, do you want to just explain?  All of a sudden this gentleman walked in.  He got your yogurt.  He got the wrong yogurt.  I sent him in to fix it, to go and get the right yogurt.  I got your yogurt.  E-Rock, while you're in here, did you get your jingle ball tickets?  Yes.  Ugh.  You want a jingle ball?  Yes.  Oh, you make me know.  Wait, wait. 
[03:28:00]  Who's playing?  Get me the line.  Oh, I don't remember.  The Killers.  All right.  Evanescence.  Justin Timberlake.  Ah, okay.  That's who you're going for.  And there's three or four more.  I can't remember.  And in that three or four more lays the reason he is going.  Right.  Although, Justin Timberlake, I'm really starting to like and I don't want to, but I can't help it.  What's that song about the...  I Got a Cock in My Mouth?  No, no, no.  That's his mantra.  How could you like Justin Timberlake?  What's the one song he's got that's... 
[03:28:30]  I don't know.  That's just it.  Eric.  Ah, Sexy Back.  That's it.  It's good.  And what is it?  What is the gist of that song?  That he's bringing the sexy back?  Pretty much.  But it's a good song, though.  Thanks.  Do we have any of it, Bill?  All right.  All right, Bill.  Oh.  This is not bad.  Tribe generic bullshit.  How many songs sound like this?  I'm bringing the sexy back. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  I like this one.  Why couldn't this just be K-Fed?  I love K-Fed.  More K-Fed.  This could just be K-Fed.  You gonna sing along with it?  At the jingle ball?  No.  He's gonna pump his fist in the air.  Gonna rave.  Gonna do some X or some E. 
[03:29:30]  Whatever they call it.  All right.  I got the lineup for the jingle ball.  By the way, the only reason I know that he's going to the jingle ball is because he gave  me his tickets by accident in a DHL package.  Or he would have flew under the radar.  How'd you get them?  What a slip up.  They weren't my tickets.  They were actually Rich Voss's tickets.  And Voss had to turn them down, so I got them.  Why?  Do you think fucking Parliament Funkadelic was playing there?  That fucking old man?  I don't know.  I'm sure they were for his kids.  But I gotta buy their love.  There's Sly and the Family Stone playing? 
[03:30:00]  Fucking stupid Voss and his old man taste.  The person he contacted for the tickets actually gave me the voicemails that Voss left with  him to try to get the tickets.  Oh, okay.  Are they good?  Yeah.  He insists that he's a television star and that maybe they need a presenter to bring out  one of the bands.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, you shitting me.  No, he doesn't.  He's pitching himself while he's asking for free tickets.  Oh, he's great.  Problem?  No.  You got these, didn't you, Than? 
[03:30:30]  No, he just deflects the focus so well.  Now it's all about Voss.  Yeah, you know what?  But if he's got Voss voicemails, he looks out today.  I hate that he put his shields up.  Go track two?  Mm-hmm.  Our shields are from...  Hi, this is Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Hey, if by any chance you have three zoo tickets kicking around, my daughters keep bothering  me, but I hate to put you in a position and ask for these.  I'll even pay for them or whatever.  It's a tongue in a position to say that word. 
[03:31:00]  Or if they cost anything or whatever.  Let me know.  Give me a call either way.  But there's no pressure.  If it can happen, it can happen.  If it can't, well...  Yeah.  Tough shit on them, huh?  All right.  I'll be at Caroline's tonight, too.  Like at 7.30.  He's plugging.  Bye.  What a vulture.  The end of that message should be, have you checked the children?  That creepy voice he has.  You hear the breathing?  That's you.  He's calling from upstairs.  You hear the breathing?  You hear the breathing?  Get out of the house.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Hi.  It's Rich Voss.  We traced the call.  It's coming from a bank.  That's the only one?  Track three, too.  Track three?  You call back.  Hey, Rich Voss.  What's going on?  Rich Voss.  I have a couple of things I have to talk to you about.  I want to find out about that Jingle Bell, whatever it's called.  Jingle Bell.  I don't know.  My kids keep bothering me.  What day it is.  Maybe if I can get some tickets.  You know, maybe I'll even introduce if you need. 
[03:32:00]  You know, I can introduce a band or two.  I'm kind of well-known, you know.  It wouldn't hurt.  Anyhow, give me a call.  Football as well.  I'm working around your area, coming up in Jersey.  And somewhere there, around there.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  You have a lovely day.  Bye.  Who did he leave these messages for?  A friend who works over there, Dave.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the guy that does the song parodies?  Maybe you need me to introduce Justin Timberlake with the Killers, you fucking ass. 
[03:32:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming to the stage, Rich Voss.  That's right.  Crickets, crickets, crickets, crickets, crickets.  Oh, boy.  Crickets, crickets, crickets.  We got him?  I got the one moment, please.  Yeah.  I saw the swines.  All right.  Now we don't have him?  All right.  Oh, damn it.  All right.  We'll enjoy it.  Fucking Bill is dressed like every wacky beach guy from an 80s movie. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, man.  Bill gave me his 20-year plan the other day, though.  It was terrific.  What is his 20-year plan?  What is a 20-year fucking plan?  Maintain for 19 years and then improve?  We all went out to lunch and I...  Fade quickly.  Sorry.  I didn't hear you, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  You missed nothing.  All right.  We all went to lunch and I decided to sit across from Bill. 
[03:33:30]  I said, Bill, how's it going?  And we got into talking about his 20-year plan, which is to live in the woods by himself.  Like who?  Well, no, I want to...  Is this on the air or just in our headphones?  No, this is on the air.  Okay, good.  My plan was one day just to do something really successful and then disappear like J.D. Salinger.  Uh-huh.  Just take it all for granted.  The key is to one day do something successful so that you can then leave and people would notice that you're gone.  You would live in the woods or something, right? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  Like a mountain man?  You could grow one of those beards.  Siberia.  Siberia.  So you want to go somewhere really remote?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Wow, that's a 20-year plan.  You know, some people just have simple plans.  That's a unique plan.  Yeah.  First, a bomb an abortion clinic and then hide.  What's going on?  Hi, Rich.  How's it going, pal?  Pretty good, TV star.  Why am I a TV star?  Exactly.  That's what we hear.  That's what we hear.  Well, you're pretty needed when it comes to major famous people.  You definitely should be on the bill. 
[03:34:30]  You know, you're kind of well-known, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, but what are you trying to say?  Nothing.  You're kind of well-known, you know.  You're well-known, you know.  You're well-known, you're playing Caroline soon.  Yeah.  Well, I am a big act.  I mean...  I don't know.  Maybe I can introduce a band or two.  Yeah, maybe you can introduce an act.  Or chill if you need me.  Well, here's the thing.  You know, when you have, you know, my exposure, just, you know, I was just at MySpace looking  at my friends, and I have a lot of friends.  You were at MySpace?  First of all, you're, there's no one in Jingle Balls over the age of 25. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  And they're the old people.  If you're 25 at the Jingle Ball, you're the old guy at the Jingle Ball.  You might recognize this presenter if your parents enjoy comedy.  Well, here's the thing.  Why do you want to be a buzzkill and go with your daughters?  Let them go alone.  Well, first of all, how my daughter, okay, when at Jingle Balls, how my daughter's going  to go into the city alone at their age?  What are they going to do?  How old are they?  The best time they went was, I think, two years ago, a year. 
[03:35:30]  How old are they?  Now or then?  Now they're 16 and 14.  I bet you then they were 14 and 12.  Yeah.  So, okay.  Why don't you take the clock, these kids, and head into the city?  Okay.  I see.  You made a fight.  They're real young.  All right.  That's fair enough.  That's terrific.  If Watts was a cool dad, I mean, he gets along with them, so they wouldn't mind hanging  with him.  Yeah, they wouldn't.  Yeah, not at all.  I'm making shows.  I was going to bring him to the traveling virus.  Yeah?  You know, but...  What happened? 
[03:36:00]  I don't know.  Whatever.  Where are you, man?  What's that?  Where are you?  I'm in my kitchen getting ready to play golf.  Huh?  No, you're in Jersey.  Yeah.  No, my kitchen's in Oklahoma, but I live in Jersey.  I wish it were.  It should be in the fucking Federal Muir building.  Yeah.  So, what are you saying that...  Because...  Oh, we seem to have been disconnected.  Hey, Anthony...  Watts is one of our spotters, too, by the way, right? 
[03:36:30]  For Saturday?  Oh, I hope so.  I'm sure it'll be very funny.  Yeah.  Pretty well known.  For the whole shopping spree, I hope so.  I'm pretty well known now.  Oh, I love him.  Here's the intro to the Star Wars Holiday Special.  Here it is.  All the stars.  Trying to get back on track.  Everything Lucas is is in this intro.  The Star Wars Holiday Special.  Starring Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker.  Oh, we know. 
[03:37:00]  Harrison Ford as Han Solo.  Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.  With Anthony Daniels as C-3PO.  Billy Dee Williams as the purse snatcher.  Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca.  Oh.  R2D2 as R2D2.  Ah.  Ah.  And James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. 
[03:37:30]  Poor sons of bitches.  Introducing Chewbacca's family.  There you go.  Ah.  His wife, Mala.  And they show the pictures of him.  It's awful.  His father, Itchy.  Itchy.  His son, Lumpy.  Nidjmi?  With special guest star.  Beatrice Arthur.  Beatrice.  Art Carney. 
[03:38:00]  Diane Carroll.  Diane Carroll.  The Jefferson Starship.  Oh.  And Gina Lulagrigua.  Harvey Korman.  Harvey Korman.  Holy shit.  And an animated Star Wars story on the Star Wars Holiday Special.  And Sharon Tate as the lasagna. 
[03:38:30]  Wow.  Oh, what a bunch of shitheads.  That sucks.  Oh, Lumpy.  The son's name was Lumpy.  Lumpy.  Why would you name him that?  That's great.  Unless Chewbacca's son has cancer.  Then I accept it.  Ah, Lumpy.  I think he blotches those spots of his hair coming out. 
[03:39:00]  Hello?  Hi.  What's up, boss?  First of all, why would you hang up on me?  I didn't.  Oh, you didn't?  I'm me.  I'm Jim.  Okay, whatever.  You call me attacking me for looking out for my youngins.  Yeah.  Okay, what a good dad would do.  Yeah.  How many fathers?  You know how many tickets?  Well, that's besides the point.  I don't even know what I said in this recording that you played.  But it was probably...  You actually plugged a gig, a Caroline's gig, to one guy on an answering machine. 
[03:39:30]  Yes.  Yeah, but that one guy might have made me hit bonus.  You don't know.  Oh, okay.  He's always thinking.  That could have put me over the top.  He knows how to market himself.  You know.  One person at a time.  Dude, how's your show doing, Rich?  Have you guys had any word?  What's that?  Your show, have you heard any word yet or no?  I saw the pilot.  I got it here.  You happy?  It is so funny.  I mean, what they kept.  Patrice is, without a doubt, one of the funniest men alive in this thing.  I'm going to show it to you guys.  I'll come in one day.  It's really funny, but who knows? 
[03:40:00]  What is it?  It's a pilot, Rich.  It's a pilot we did for Comedy Central.  Oh, cool.  So, it's funny.  Anyhow, I'll see you guys Saturday.  And any good dad would have done what I did for my...  Who's getting dressed over there?  Who's that in the corner?  Oh.  Anthony, who's that in the top right of Paltrow?  Renee's Vengeance.  God damn it, she has a nice body.  Well, she was just completely naked.  Oh, can I see your breasts, Renee, please?  We missed the show.  I didn't see it.  I want to see her bosom.  She has a great fucking body.  The old Paltrow side show, you know. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  It's there, girls naked.  I'm squeezing my cock shaft and she's ignoring me.  Thanks a million.  Well.  Thanks a million.  Well, we have the two minutes of Wookiees talking.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  It just goes on and on.  It goes to a commercial, I think.  This is the fucking opening of the special.  I did that dog shit hand solo, poorly acted thing by Harrison Ford.  How dare you, Mr. President?  Oh, fuck yourself.  And then the stupid opening.  This is what they go to.  The Treehouse. 
[03:41:00]  No subtitles, by the way.  Really?  No.  That's lumpy shitting.  Wait.  Right.  There's the father choking on something.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there. 
[03:41:30]  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Look at how this goes on 
[03:42:00]  They're just doing family things  It's fucking awful  Can you fucking believe this? 
[03:42:30]  And it just  They're not even doing anything  Where you know what they're talking about  Or supposed to be doing  Well here's the line  Matt in New York City  A very merry Terry Schiavo Christmas  Yeah  Boy that does sound like her  I just want you to  Fucking lick my ass  And suck Lumpy's cock  If you agree with this 
[03:43:00]  Just look me in the eye  And go  Why would Chewbacca want to get home  To those fucking zeros?  Oh please  Hey Renee's vengeance  Could you drop a log on that seat?  What a dumper she has  Fucking why would you want to  Race home through space for that?  And Han Solo  And fucking Harrison's Ford acting  And that clip stunk  You know something?  Uninspired drivel  Yeah he's  Believe me he's not the best actor  And he  He obviously did not want to do this  Looked at it like it's dog shit 
[03:43:30]  And didn't want to fucking do it  But he had to sit there  And act like  First of all  They're supposed to be like  Intergalactic smugglers  The guy kills people  You know he kills other  Other alien things  And things that are  Threatening his life  Runs from the law  Smuggles things  He's a criminal  Yes  And there he is  I'll get you home  To your family  What does Chewbacca's family think  That he's a criminal  That Chewbacca's a  He's a criminal  He wants to get home for life day 
[03:44:00]  Life day  What does that mean?  They all hang out in the treehouse  And do what?  I don't know  Chewbacca fingers his wife  And tells the father he's a burden  And tells the kitty was a mistake  And then the fucking  It was like Christmas in the projects  Pretty much  Because the cops wind up  Coming to the house  The imperial stormtroopers  Come to the house  Looking for Chewbacca  Yeah  And they cover for him  And say no  We don't know where it is  I don't know 
[03:44:30]  How does every fucking person  Speak that awful language?  How does Han Solo speak it?  Yeah  How do you understand that?  It is such garbage  That Luke has tried to pull  Every single copy from existence  And it does nothing but sell like  Hotcakes  At Star Wars conventions  They all want a copy  Everyone wants one  And every nerd  That's worth their salt  Has a copy  And why by the way  Did he approve this? 
[03:45:00]  It had to be approved by him  I think again  Back then  He was thinking  You know  This is a one hit wonder  Star Wars thing  It's got some momentum  Let me capitalize while I can  And didn't realize  It was going to go to  Fucking you know  30 fucking years  Of milk in this cow  And by the way  Why doesn't this fucking  No self  A humor asshole  Just release it  And say it's one of the  Worst things ever done  On DVD  People would buy it  Yeah  Why not?  Just admit what it is  Hey it was a bad move  It's 28 years ago  He cannot 
[03:45:30]  We fucked up  The commentary would be hilarious  Yes  He wants to  I hear  They take themselves  Too seriously  In Hollywood  He cannot possibly  Fit any more money  In the Lucas vault  Yeah  He liked it  Just tamp it down  Harrison Ford going  Oh my god  Look at how awful  I am in this scene  I just was uninspired  We hated the script  Make fun of it  Yeah  Princess Leia  Let Carrie Fisher  Talk about how she was  Doped up  Singing that song  At the end  She sings a song  And she is so drugged  Out of her mind  And Mark Hamill  In his big scene 
[03:46:00]  With R2-D2  Is wearing so much makeup  It is embarrassing to watch  I have to see it  I have to get a copy  Of the whole thing  Yeah  How long is it?  It goes on forever  Dude it is like  Two fucking hours long  And doesn't B. Arthur say  God's gonna get you  For that Darth  She plays the  Bartender  At that cantina  That you love so much  And she's the 
[03:46:30]  She's the like  Real spicy bartender  Giving some guff  To the people at the bar  Hey you  My cock's a lot bigger  Than yours fucko  And that  You know  Awful elephant  Playing the piano  With his  Big done elephant fingers  I want to fucking  Tie Lucas up  And make him watch that  While I rape him  Fuck his little backside  The musicians playing this  Absolutely looked like 
[03:47:00]  Like asses  With  Clarinets  Shoved up their asses  And that's how  They were playing the music  Big asses  Clarinet  Shoved in the asshole  They look like puppets  Van you got some?  Well just  No  No  I just like sitting here  No  No  They obviously had no budget  For it  Yeah  So they wanted something  Exciting to happen  So halfway through  The movie  They just switched to  A cartoon  Yeah it was  Right out of nowhere  A cartoon  With the animated 
[03:47:30]  Characters  And that had nothing  To do really  With what was going on  With the plot  That thick plot  Of the special itself  And then  My favorite  Was the scene  With the old  Grandpa there  What was his name?  Midgeme?  Midgeme?  He's sitting there  And he gets a present  That is  Diane Carroll I guess  Doing an erotic dance  In miniature  She's like a little 
[03:48:00]  Superimposed miniature thing  And he is  What amounts to  In Wookie  Jerking off  To her  Doing this exotic dance  To interspliced music  And video of the  Jefferson Starship  Right right  It is fucking  All over the place  And I'll bet you  Why they did the cartoon  They probably wanted to  Stretch it for X amount  Of time  To get the commercials in  And they probably  Read out of material  So they said  Let's do the cartoon  Or it was to advertise  The cartoons  They were going to  Fucking show on  Saturday morning  Let's go to  Shwoogie  Shwoogie  Hey boobo boys 
[03:48:30]  What's going on  First appearance of  Boba Fett  Was in that cartoon  Was it really?  Yes  Hold on  A little trivia  Go ahead  Hey boobo boys  Let's know this whole thing  Is available on YouTube  You gotta hunt around  Because they broke it up in parts  Travis told me that  The whole thing was up there  But they took it down  But you can find this whole thing  On YouTube  I just saw part of it on YouTube  I couldn't see how shitty the set  Anthony mentioned the set was bad  Like when they were in the  Imperial of the ship  Yeah the flight deck set is so bad  It is not the flight deck  That they had in the movie 
[03:49:00]  Obviously  It's just some cheap little thing  That shakes a little bit  And it's just so bad  And then they use all the stock footage  Of the Millennium Falcon  Let's get to Princess Leia  Doing her little song  Okay here's Carrie Fisher  Who knew she could sing  And the best part about  The fucking father  Was when he was yelling at Chewbacca  And he goes  Frrrr  I'm good  Now the earthlings at Kenner  Have asked my associate and me  To present the Star Wars Collection  Truly remarkable toys and games  For your  Ah yeah there's the pitch 
[03:49:30]  That's what the whole fucking special  Is about George  There's the pitch  Well this is labeled  I must have flipped those  It's coming around Christmas time  So you gotta sell  You gotta sell  Yeah okay  Life's day  Princess Leia  This holiday is yours  But we all share with you  The hope that this day  Is a special  To freedom  And to harmony  And to peace  She's slurring  No matter how different we appear  We're all the same  In our struggle against  The powers of evil  And darkness  I hope that this day  Will always be a day of joy  In which we can reconfirm 
[03:50:00]  Our dedication  And our courage  And more than anything else  Than anything else  Our love for one another  Wait who is she singing to?  This is the promise  Of the tree of life  Oh and then  Here she is  Wow  It's not as bad as I remember it being  I cannot shut it off now  Until she says it  I don't care  I saw the script  No one's gonna drag you up 
[03:50:30]  To get into the light  Where you belong  I'm used to you  Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey  She's all breathless  She's great  We celebrate 
[03:51:00]  A day of peace  A day of harmony  Who would sit through this?  A day of joy  I believe she's singing to  Chewie's family  And everyone else  Is she in the treehouse?  God  Holy shit 
[03:51:30]  Like what the fuck  Were they thinking?  I don't know  Trying to work the actual  Star Wars music into it?  Yeah  To hold someone's interest  Da-da-da-da-da-da  Oh  Where's Vader to choke her out?  Yeah  This is what people  Who enjoyed the movie 
[03:52:00]  Star Wars wanted to see  Apparently not  He pulled every copy  People don't realize  That  That  This got the voice  Oh no  Wait  What happened?  Oh no  Oh no  Yes  Get her with the Imperial Taser  Is there anything else  You want to play off this?  I'm so annoyed  It is so  Yeah  Watch it  Another  I mean we got more Wookiee talking  We got Art Carney 
[03:52:30]  Jefferson Starship  Let's hear Art Carney  What does he do?  He's got to be awful  He's the comic relief  So it's great  B. Arthur  What does he do?  B. Arthur  I don't  He just  He's a  A handyman  I think  Oh my god  Something like that  Yes he's the one  That took images  Of Lumpy  And put them on his hard drive  And was file trading  With Gary Glitter  Look at this  Look at this  Wookiee cock  Hit it  Lumpy boy  He would  When I was a boy 
[03:53:00]  My favorite thing  Was the Star Wars Holiday Special  It actually brought a smile to my face  When the Wookiees were hugging  Horrid  Excuse me  Excuse me  Got a wall screen  Good to see you again  Don't say a word madam  I know just why you're calling  You're wondering when that shaggy carpet you ordered will arrive at your home  And be assure you madam 
[03:53:30]  It's on its way  You know it was made especially for you by a little old woman four planets away  She did it all by herself  In fact you might say she did it by hand  Solo  So it's going to take some time to get to you  Speaking in code  I know you understand  Understand right  Terrific  By the way I'll be by later to drop off that extra photon energy pack  You're welcome  That's right he was getting messages from Han Solo and Chewie as to when they were going to arrive 
[03:54:00]  And had to convey that message to them  But it in code because you know the Empire they were listening  So he used such a tricky code  Shaggy carpet  Shaggy carpet  And then Han Solo  That's a good one  That code was only trumped by the code in Star Trek  Where if we go by the book  It will take three days 
[03:54:30]  If days seem like hours  How long will it take  Three days  By the book  Get it  And there's Khan supposed to be some super fucking human intelligence and everything  I can't figure out the code  He tasks me  He tasks me but I shall have him  With his tricky code  Yeah if we go by the book  Days will seem like hours  How long to fix it  Three days  If we go by the book 
[03:55:00]  Could that be a fucking code  That's maybe what  That's what they figured  Khan would just go  That can't possibly be a fucking code  It must really be three days  Wow  And the whole time fucking  Art Carney is talking in code  The cameraman is blinking out torture  Fucking  Are we done with this?  I think we should  Yeah  We should  Here's what we should do to the XMers  To straighten him out  Yeah  We should fucking start us from the beginning  And play it in real time  And leave  The entire special  It's two hours long 
[03:55:30]  How am I doing?  You're doing great sweetie  Bear with me while we read  Well that's true  This is Dr. Girlfriend  From TV's The Venture Brothers  And I'm winging it  Because nobody prepared copy  No copy whatsoever  Improv  Absolutely prepared  You are listening to the Opie and Anthony show  On XM Satellite Radio  From space  And you are listening to it  And we would like to wish you  And all of America  A safe, happy, and healthy holiday season  And I love you

[04:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  This just in, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  This story coming from the Boston Herald in 1994.  Tom Likas, charged with beating and threatening to kill his fourth wife  after getting tanked at a company Christmas party.  He had to attend a domestic violence training class.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[04:01:00]  Let's speak with the woman now.  Thank you.  Yes.  And furthermore, she had to say,  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes, thank you for that exclusive injury.  Special report, huh?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[04:01:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Rockin' around.  Twisted the tree at the Christmas party.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Miss the floor on where you can see.  And it's a couple times to start.  Rockin' around.  Twisted the tree at the Christmas party.  Let her let her sing.  Damn.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  paint by the shoes of cuddle.  Do you ever get a sweet little feeling when you hear me? 
[04:02:00]  Oh, kissin' picking ladies.  Aw, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Thank you for those filled with bardzo bubbly.  Christmas night night.  We'll be right back. 
[04:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[04:03:00]  We'll be right back. 
[04:03:30]  We'll be right back. 
[04:04:00]  That really pissed you off, Tom.  I wonder what song was playing when he took the log to her head.  We're just imagining it was rocking around the Christmas tree.  Might have been like Silent Night or something.  The stockings are hung by the chimney with care, and soon I'll throw my bitch wife in there. 
[04:04:30]  I'm old St. Prick today.  It's the worst of O'Bee and Anthony's Christmas edition.  I thought of you guys at my parents' house for Christmas.  Thanks, Peter.  The very Brady Christmas was on from 88.  It was so funny because Peter and Bobby were sharing the living room, and Peter had on a night shirt. 
[04:05:00]  I'm like, who wears whoever in this, at least from after 1850, has worn a night shirt.  A night shirt.  And you can't look at Robert Reed, do anything without noticing how gay he is now.  The hand on the hip.  Very gay.  The left hand being this, while the right arm is a kimbo on the hip.  You cannot notice.  Peter!  Peter!  Why don't you slip this sexy little night shirt on, Peter? 
[04:05:30]  Because it's no fun unless I can pull something up in the back.  That's why all the Brady boys wear the night shirts.  He just gave up acting straight.  Because I think in the original series, I don't think you can tell at all, but you're right.  These later episodes and specials that came out, he just said, ask her.  I am what I am, and here it is.  Those scenes where he's laying in bed with Carol at the end of the show, doing the little show closer,  and they have to make like they're a loving married couple. 
[04:06:00]  It's like, oh my, oh, Carol, come here.  Let me give you a kiss, I guess.  I can smell that vagina from up here.  Ew!  Mind if I sleep in the boys' room tonight, Carol?  Greg, do you think I could shove that big horse sculpture at the bottom of the stairs on my ass?  Let's try. 
[04:06:30]  There's one scene where one of the Brady kids, like one of their kids, like whether it was Marsh's little eight-year-old red-headed son,  slid down the banister and Robert Reed was at the bottom of the catch-up.  I'll catch you.  Come on down.  Oh, he's coming so fast.  So am I.  Oh, yeah.  I love those boys.  Ugh.  Stupid.  Girls, you okay?  All right, good night.  Hi, boys. 
[04:07:00]  Let me tuck in and read you a little story.  Once upon a time, there was a homosexual actor playing a dad.  Well, I understand that he would molest Bobby and Greg, but he wouldn't molest Peter because Peter wasn't mechanically inclined.  Peter, why don't you put on the Phil Packer mustache you wore in episode 33 and, you know, tickle my little member down here with that mustache.  All right, boys, we're going to play Steal the Playbook. 
[04:07:30]  I put it in my pants.  Now, you boys got to steal it so Greg can read the plays.  I've rolled up these plans and put them in this tube.  Now, you've got to hide them in me.  I've got to run, I've got to run. 
[04:08:00]  I've got to run, I've got to run.  Don't pop as five in hot bad and pretty hooked bad.  So do skin draft.  Would you like that for five with that?  Would you like that for five with that?  Where is the fair? 
[04:08:30]  Wait, put the valve.  Can you hear the valve?  Where is the brave?  Ding,nisse doing, ding, bunu, dong, ding,지를, don't.  Ding,進, fun,erin,engo.  I was the looking king.  Making fluid whoppers, I would pay for it.  Would you like that for five with that?  Would you like that for five with that?  Ding, administer, durch, Beverly, General,Su skates, on, мног, comment.  Ding, Lemon.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  It's The Worst of O.B. Anthony, Christmas Edition.  I'm your various, Sirius 197, XM202. 
[04:09:00]  It's The Worst of O.B. Anthony's Christmas Edition.  Let's go to Mark.  Yeah, how are they?  Hey.  Uh, yeah, I was listening to you guys make fun of ...  Celine Dion a few times about her camel toe,  and I finally saw the camel toe, man.  How funny is that?  Oh, my God.  That thing was out there.  I told you.  You guys are so right with that.  I was laughing.  My wife didn't even know what I was laughing about.  Did she have one of those jumpsuits on last night?  No, she had these button-up pants, man. 
[04:09:30]  The button was all the way up to her belly button.  She had this big thing hanging down there.  It was a camel toe.  Oh, she had the camel toe going?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  God, I missed that one.  My Merry Christmas show.  This is not only for everyone that enjoys Christmas or even Hanukkah.  This goes out to everybody who enjoys Christmas and especially to this life.  Here it comes. 
[04:10:00]  Merry Christmas to all.  Come down and play my flute, you can't.  Shut up, Mark.  You can't suck, man.  All right.  Bye, Mark.  And I'm sure there wasn't a Christmas tree on the mighty Titanic.  But if there was, they all deserve presents because they will soon be dead in the icy waters 
[04:10:30]  of the North Atlantic.  Ah, I missed that.  Damn.  I know.  I would have liked to check that out.  There must have been some good viewing.  Camel toe on there.  Retire, Reddy.  Retire.  Big reindeer hoof in my pants.  That's what it looks like.  A big knuckily reindeer hoof with my emaciated pelvis. 
[04:11:00]  Watch Santa and his elves disappear into my gash.  My cavernous gash.  And up the chimney?  No.  Up my gash.  Goes Santa.  With all the presents for the children and the survivors.  On dasher, on dancer, on prancer. 
[04:11:30]  In my gash.  The stockings were hung by my gash with care.  In Holt and St. Nick would disappear in there.  Dashing through my gash in a one-horse open sleigh.  All these survivors go.  Saying, my, what a big gash.  That's a huge one. 
[04:12:00]  I will play jingle gash.  But Christmas is a very special time of year for everybody.  To get presents as Santa comes down my gash.  My husband turns me over at Christmas time and uses my gash as a Christmas tree stand.
