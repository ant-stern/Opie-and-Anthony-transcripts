<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous, exaggerated fictional story about a rage-inducing virus, followed by the hosts' usual banter about their exhaustion and disinterest in food due to their demanding work schedule.  They playfully teased "Club Soda Kenny," an employee who brought the wrong fruit for their morning routine.  A discussion about the Detroit Tigers' celebratory win contrasted with the Yankees' typically subdued reactions led to reminiscing about past chaotic sports celebrations, including a memorable goalpost incident.  A graphic, sexually explicit discussion followed concerning a revealing photograph of Scarlett Johansson in the New York Post.

The show then shifted to a heartfelt tribute to a deceased listener, "Rich," featuring shared memories and a mention of a YouTube tribute video.  Listener calls ensued, including one describing a potential contestant for the "Fatty Pig Fatty Contest," and another providing information about a fan's funeral.  The hosts then discussed an MTV show featuring a person with Tourette's Syndrome, using explicit language and crude jokes.  This transitioned into a discussion of a Rachel Hunter photo in Hustler magazine.  The show promoted upcoming events, including "Tourette's Day" and a YouTube video contest, and explained their "Whip Him Out Wednesday" segment involving women flashing their breasts.

Comedian Bill Burr joined the show as a guest.  They extensively discussed an MTV's "True Life" episode about a woman with Tourette's Syndrome, using offensive language to describe her behavior and appearance.  This led to a comparison with another "True Life" episode featuring a man with the same condition.  The conversation included a significant segment on Burr's experience being booed during stand-up performances in Philadelphia and Cleveland, analyzing the incidents and including listener-submitted songs mocking Cleveland. Other topics included a “Line of the Day” contest, Anthony’s new Mustang and driving habits, criticisms of later seasons of "Pimp My Ride," and a discussion of roadside memorials and "ghost bikes."  Notable calls included one from a listener who had lost six friends to drunk driving, a heated exchange with the hosts, and a discussion of a midget opera singer.  The segment also included mentions of Sam Adams (a four-year-old flagged by the TSA), Mel Gibson's apology, a dog walker offered a job at MSNBC, and Barbra Streisand's interaction with a heckler.  An outdoor "walk-over" segment featured an encounter with an Italian intern.

Further chaotic discussions followed, including announcements of a commercial deal with the "Soup Nazi," a discussion of producer Jimmy's unusual breakfast, and a humorous misidentification of a caller.  They played and discussed Mr. T's song, "Be Somebody," featuring an "inspirational diatribe," and a graphic discussion about the contents of a book titled "Pink Box Inside Japan Sex Clubs," which included numerous sexually explicit descriptions and offensive racial stereotypes.  The show touched on Segways, their failed commercial success, and other technological failures.  A listener corrected Anthony’s misidentification of the Ming Dynasty.  Butcher Ed Brock's music was played and discussed, alongside various rap artists.  A listener suggested looking up motorcycle stunt videos, prompting a discussion of dangerous videos, including one depicting a woman's graphic fall.  The show ended with further discussion of YouTube videos, including a dominatrix audio clip, and their "F.U." segment, using highly offensive language.

A significant portion focused on Karen Von Croft, a dominatrix, analyzing her videos with graphic and sexually explicit descriptions of various sexual acts and positions.  Callers provided video recommendations and corrections to mispronunciations.  The conversation included tangents on personal hygiene, menstruation, masturbation techniques, and the history of women's horseback riding attire.  Studio audio of The Trogs' heated argument was played, followed by a discussion of Kojo's artwork featuring Opie and Anthony for Maxim magazine, and efforts to pressure the magazine for publication.  Sal, a caller, mentioned "kuguri isu," a Japanese term related to a sexual practice.  The "Fatty Pig Fatty Contest" segment featured a live call with a contestant from Texas, with the hosts making numerous crude and offensive comments about her weight and appearance. The show concluded with the "Line of the Day" segment, featuring offensive and dark humor, and a Citizen Cope song.  A later segment focused heavily on a female guest's weight, with the hosts using extremely crude and offensive language to describe her body, comparing her to Mr. Met and a keg.  Her weight, family history, and lifestyle choices were discussed, alongside off-color jokes and references to sexual acts.  Her cousin briefly participated, and Bill Burr was referenced.  The broadcast ended with more banter, a Citizen Cope song, and a mention of "Whip them out Wednesday."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  Right from the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates and kills this cast.  These numbers can't be right. 
[00:00:30]  The numbers are correct.  I wish to God they weren't.  It's at one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  Such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  You've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right. 
[00:01:00]  We're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's out Friday-wide. 
[00:01:30]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Good Lord.  Good Lord.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Okay, okay, okay.  No, no, no!  It's in.  Okay.  I don't know. 
[00:02:00]  I just can't believe that I did that.  I am such an idiot.  I mean, you could see how a white girl can fall for him.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Dope.  Ah, everyone's settling in. 
[00:02:30]  Good morning for another fine O.P. and Anthony show.  Hi.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Oh, yeah, this is the portion of the show where we've got to make believe we're wide awake.  Wide awake.  People ask me that all the time.  How do you sound so wide awake and chipper so early in the morning?  I fake it.  Acting lessons, that's how. 
[00:03:00]  Acting lessons.  Dancing lessons.  That's it.  And people usually ask at, you know, 11.30 or so after the show when I'm crashing and  they expect and want the same energy out of me that I gave during the program and they're  not going to get it.  Like, and they don't understand.  They think maybe I'm either mad or annoyed having to talk to them, which I usually am,  but I hide that part of it and it's just that I'm tired. 
[00:03:30]  You know, usually it's like a sponsor meeting or something like that.  Yeah.  Meeting other people.  There's something we have to do after the show.  Boy, they're really boring in real life.  It's like, what happened?  No, we're just tired.  Was there a problem?  Like, Anthony didn't seem, like, happy to be there or, you know, he wasn't really energetic.  No.  No.  God damn it's no.  It's that we do five to five and a half hours of original radio a day.  I go home and sleep every day.  I crash for a few hours after this is over. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe you have a little lunch.  I have a sleeper for a few hours.  I did stupid nap yesterday and it ruined me.  Was that the eight hour one?  Oh, it was long enough.  It was, you know, I got home.  It was something like 1230.  Decided to lay down a little bit.  Wake up 440.  Too long.  Too long.  Because then what are you going to do?  You can't do anything, really.  It's 440.  For God's sake, I got to get up early.  So then you just wander around the house a little bit, shuffle around from computer to computer. 
[00:04:30]  With your slippers on.  And, you know, you eat something because your body needs it.  I have no joy in eating.  I wish they'd finally come up with the little pills that we can take that we were supposed to have for the future.  That is now.  I was just telling my brother, eating is overrated.  Eating's a pain in the ass.  When you do the type of hours we do, and I guess we're talking to other people right now that do the same hours we do.  Eating is just overrated.  You're doing it because you have to. 
[00:05:00]  Who enjoys eating at 5 in the morning?  Not 5 in the morning.  There's a rare, but I don't care any time.  There's a rare instance where you're out and you're at a really good restaurant and you're like, oh my God, this food is so good.  And it's enjoyable.  But for the most part, eating, one big pain in the ass, waste of time.  You're just shoving stuff in your mouth.  Yes, this is so I can live.  I'm doing this to live another day. 
[00:05:30]  That's all.  It's not fun.  It's not that enjoyable.  Sometimes you go, oh, that's tasty.  But for the most part, I want the pills on the plate to take them.  And you feel full.  It's like, oh, there you go.  It nourishes your body and you're fine.  See, I like eating.  I've grown because I'm older.  Oh, no.  Cut it out.  I tease.  You look fantastic.  One and two and three.  I've grown to really like eating out as a ritual thing. 
[00:06:00]  I kind of like the whole process of it.  Well, that's what you do if you live in New York.  That's all you do is eat.  I can't cook.  That's all you do in New York City.  That I enjoy.  Find another place to eat out.  I enjoy, okay, I enjoy the ritual of it.  If you're with people, things like that, the little chatter, the chit chat, things like  that are fine and fun.  I'd rather do it sitting at a bar.  Tell you the truth.  I'd rather do it just sitting at a bar, ball game up on the TV, hanging out, yapping, and 
[00:06:30]  drinking a couple of beers or something.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I understand the ritualistic thing of it.  You know, you're hanging out.  Speaking of eating.  Annoying.  What's wrong with Club Soda Kenny today?  It says it right on the prep sheet.  Blueberry season has been called.  Why?  I don't know, but it does say it on the prep sheet.  Blueberry season has been called.  It's called.  We said that a couple days ago.  Time.  And Club Soda Kenny walks in with blueberries from Bolivia or wherever the hell that they're 
[00:07:00]  in season.  I took a shot.  There were no strawberries, or are you sick of cutting up the strawberries every morning?  There was like two bundles of strawberries, and they had rotten ones in them, so I took  a shot with the blueberries, and I got you a nice banana.  Kenny is, I don't know, I think he's going to end up punching me in the face.  Did you get a haircut?  Yes, sir.  All of them.  Ooh.  All of them.  That old gag.  Would they use Eli Whitney's cotton gin?  A mulcher. 
[00:07:30]  A mulcher.  Somebody with a sickle.  It looks lovely, and then he shaved the half mustache that he grows.  Yeah, I got an image.  He's got no commitment.  He's got an image.  He's got no real commitment toward that mustache.  He grows it.  Until it's almost a mustache.  To the point where it's as creepy as it could possibly be, and then he shaves it.  Like, if he continues from that point, it would look like a normal mustache.  It would be a mustache.  No, but like for 25 years, I had to shave every day for work, so now I'm getting like a little  lazy with the shaving. 
[00:08:00]  Nice.  You can do that here.  Yeah.  Geek Radio.  You cut a mean strawberry now, man.  I do the best I can.  It's just like chasing down perps all over Jersey, right?  Yeah.  Cutting off these strawberries.  A lot of people wonder what happens to these detectives and cops after they retire.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, well, you hear the sorrow in his voice?  He's like, yeah, well.  Do you remember in the old days when people's heads used to come apart like those strawberries?  Nothing like busting a knuckle in a jawbone.  Makes the broken knuckle worth it. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's getting so excited.  He's like, yeah.  Look at the smile.  All right.  Yeah.  He loved his job.  Thank you, Kenny, though.  The blueberries were fantastic.  They're acceptable.  Yeah.  They were worth the $8 we have to pay for them.  They look good.  It's unbelievable.  They just raised the price.  Worth their wage in gold.  I go bananas from now on.  No more blueberries for me.  Blueberries can take a walk.  Excuse my French. 
[00:09:00]  You're going bananas?  Well, you know what I meant by that, Jimmy, but it sounds like.  You're making me look nuts.  All right.  What else we got going on today?  Well, we got to say hi to Detroit once again.  Detroit.  Wow.  It's all about Detroit.  You know, I never have an interest in another team when the Yankees are out of it.  But I'm kind of attracted to the Tigers here.  I was watching a little bit of the game last night.  Yeah.  It was very, another nice little blowout for them. 
[00:09:30]  You have to root for them at this point.  Yeah.  You have to.  I'm a Mets fan.  I'm not going to get crazy.  But if the Mets get knocked out, then it's all about the Tigers.  I say Tigers win the World Series if the Mets get knocked out.  Their team's got personality.  I like that.  It goes a long way.  Yeah, but know what the problem is?  Like Arnold, that pig on Green Acres.  Because everyone is making the argument.  And my brother was.  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  My brother was saying in the office, you know, the Yankees would never celebrate like the Tigers did the other night.  We were saying that on the radio.  A lot of people sort of saying that. 
[00:10:00]  That's refreshing to see the Tigers and how they were on that dugout and throwing the champagne.  Genuinely enjoying the victory.  Not like it was expected of them and handed to them.  And I thought they were going to go old school.  I really thought they were going to charge the field and just rip it up.  Start tearing up the field.  Oh, man.  I miss those days.  Yeah.  Remember when the Yankees would win it?  It would just get insane.  Yeah, they had to put a stop to that.  Remember Wade Boggs?  Who was on the horse?  Yeah, Wade Boggs.  It was Wade Boggs on the horse. 
[00:10:30]  He got on a cop horse and he's trotting around.  He looked drunk.  He's got champagne.  He's trotting around on a police horse.  That crap isn't happening anymore.  Ever.  No.  Very dangerous.  I tell the famous story when I was living in western New York and I was a huge Bills fan  and they won the conference title or whatever the hell.  They won the AFC.  Put it this way.  They didn't win any Super Bowls.  Yeah, yeah.  Good point.  You can keep that out of your vocabulary.  Super Bowl win.  It was the game that they won. 
[00:11:00]  They won the Super Bowl.  It was the game they won that brought them to the Super Bowl.  AFC Championship Series.  There you go.  And it was a home game and everyone ran out onto the field.  I've told the story many times.  I was there and I could not believe what I was seeing.  They take down the goal post, which we used to be very traditional, which we've seen a  million times.  I wonder if this video is up on YouTube, by the way.  I have no idea.  I'm going to have to search this out.  They ripped the goal post down and it was in one piece at this point.  And then they, as a crowd, were able to carry it all the way up the stadium and throw 
[00:11:30]  it over the side of the stadium.  It was the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in my life.  Like ants.  Like ants.  They were just like, you know, yeah, they got...  Ants of the cricket.  They got teamwork.  They got a few hundred people on this thing and they decided to walk it all the way up  to the top of the stadium.  And next thing you know, you see...  Heave it over.  They heave it over the top.  And I'm sure there was somebody that said, OK, it's all clear down there and safe. 
[00:12:00]  No one's going to be down there for it to fall on.  So throw it over now.  And Noah's...  Yeah!  Those were the days, man.  And then we're finally driving home hours later because now, you know, it's a big day for  the Bills, so we're back in the parking lot drinking and throwing the football around  and doing a little barbecue.  We finally get in our cars about an hour, hour and a half later, whatever.  And, you know, long traffic out of there.  And you got about 10 fans still holding on to one piece of the goal post. 
[00:12:30]  Because at this point, it's been ripped up into different sections.  But I watched this one section being walked down the highway, and they're basically waiting  to see who would be the last guy to let go, and they would finally get this damn thing.  But they're just walking with it.  And to this day, there's goal posts and all the bars around the stadium up there.  They cut it up.  Oh, they cut it up.  Yeah.  And they distributed it all over Buffalo.  Very proud moment.  But I thought the Tigers, getting back to them, we're going to go old school and something 
[00:13:00]  crazy was going to happen.  And they just had that energy, like all it needed was one idiot to jump on the field.  I think all hell would have broken loose up there.  Just ripping up grass is pretty much all they can do.  Yeah.  Bases.  But the point I'm making, a lot of people are saying the Yankees would never do that.  You watch the Tigers win that, win the World Series this year.  Next year, they become like, you know, the new Yankees.  Like, then all of a sudden, it's not a big deal anymore, and they'll get the attitude.  Yeah.  A lot of people think, you know, that no offense to the Tigers, that they're different than everybody 
[00:13:30]  else.  They just haven't won it in a while.  They're the underdogs.  But as soon as they get a taste of victory, then they get a taste of the fame and everything  else that goes with it.  And the next time they win it, it will be in a locker room like the Yankees would just  pouring champagne over their heads and stuff like that.  Barely.  That's just how it works in sports.  I'm not trashing the Tigers or anything.  It was nice to see them, though, in the crowd, just like giving the fans reach-arounds  and stuff.  I mean, they were pretty...  Yeah, helping out.  They were pretty seriously excited for everybody.  Well, it's like, you know, the Yankees just... 
[00:14:00]  The bottom line is once you're expected to win, and it's a pressure...  Oh, I love her.  Sorry.  There was a distracting photo ever, ever that was up on TV.  Oh, the TV even picked up on this picture.  Wow.  Look.  It's in...  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Did you want to finish your thoughts on it?  Because this is...  Let me show you.  I remember...  Baseball fun.  I remember the page.  13, right?  It's 13, right?  Okay.  Jimmy.  I had it open before.  I was looking at...  She is...  Yeah, but you missed it in the office.  Is it the Post? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  It's the New York Post today.  I'm sure it's in your local paper.  They have a picture of Scarlett Johansson.  She is wearing what?  Like a varsity sweater?  Varsity sweater.  Varsity, same color knee socks that are pulled up over her knees.  That's the style, by the way.  That's the style.  And then tiny, tiny green boy shorts, right?  Little green boy shorts.  And that sweater is open in the front, completely open.  Full.  Just barely covering what would make the picture illegal to have in the paper. 
[00:15:00]  It shows the swell of her bosom.  Yes.  Definitely the swell of her bosom.  Her right one.  And then the left one a little more covered up.  There's no sag there whatsoever.  She's even pushing down on the sweater, and the boob refuses to give.  Look at how it's stretching the sweater.  Right.  It will not give.  It's pulling up the buttonholes around.  Right.  Because her breast is trying so hard to push back with its elasticity. 
[00:15:30]  She's got her left hand in the pocket, and she's pushing down, so that would, like, maybe  flatten it out.  No.  There's nothing.  No.  No.  It refuses.  These are gravity-defying.  This is for the new issue of Allure magazine.  And there's a quote.  I do think on some basic level we are animals, and by instinct we kind of breed accordingly,  she tells the mag.  Well, we are like animals, because a bunch of guys are going to be acting like monkeys in  cages to this picture. 
[00:16:00]  But as much as I believe that I work really hard when I'm in a relationship to make it  work in a monogamous way.  What?  Would you look at the picture again and got all tripped up?  I missed a word or two in that sense.  I don't know.  She's saying as much as she believes that we're like animals, that she's still in a relationship.  When she's in a relationship, she's monogamous.  There's no fetish I would not engage in.  The funniest thing, we're all in the office, we all go, well, you know, it's early in the  morning, and we're always just looking for some kind of joy, because it's just miserable 
[00:16:30]  to be up this early.  And when a picture like this hits the paper, someone will just shout out, page 13, the  post.  And we all go there, right?  Yeah, it's like an alert.  And then Anthony, we're all just like, ah, habba, habba, habba, habba.  And Anthony goes, I go, is there any place on her that you wouldn't just lick?  But then Anthony, then Anthony has to go right for the dirtiest of the dirties.  Yeah, I go, is there any place on her that you wouldn't lick? 
[00:17:00]  And then he goes to the dirtiest of the dirties, and I'm just like, well.  I go right to the filthiest of the filthiest, throwing it around the room, thinking like,  all right, where would you or wouldn't you?  But I didn't realize I went with pretty much ground zero.  There isn't anyone, well, yeah, her ankle.  Right, right.  Like, I went right for the lowest of the low.  Let me help you out here.  It wasn't like anyone was going to disagree with you whatsoever, but it was just so weird  that you went for the dirtiest of the dirty, instead of maybe working your way up to that. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, work your way up.  If she died, and she was on the coroner's table, I'd slice her head open and lick her  brain stem.  Okay.  See, there isn't any place.  Yeah, well.  That's hysterical.  It's like, I remember the feeling of her when I put my arm around her.  Oh, shut up.  What?  When I met her, I couldn't help her.  That you met her.  You awful man.  Hey, E-Rock, can you find that picture on the internet so we could share with the rest  of the country?  I'm sure it's in a lot of papers today.  Wow.  I mean, if your paper doesn't have this picture, then the guy that runs the paper is just a 
[00:18:00]  faggot.  He has got to just, yeah.  He's got to like, because you know, the people that run these newspapers, they get a pile  of stuff every day.  Well, what should we have in tomorrow's paper?  And if you come across that picture that's available for everybody, and you're not thrown  in that, in your paper, then there's something for you.  No, you bounce Kim Jong-il for that picture.  That's right.  I think even the New York Times has that picture in there somewhere.  And that stupid, stipple kind of photo they put next to the articles that the staff writers 
[00:18:30]  write, the columnists.  They find the most boring photos in the Times.  It's just awful.  They're like pen drawings.  That's what they are?  Of the columnists?  Yeah, that's the Wall Street Journal.  Oh, it's the Wall Street Journal?  Yeah, that's the Wall Street Journal.  See, I have no clue.  I think they're both the same paper.  I don't know.  I know the New York Post and the Daily News.  I see the people that read the New York Times walking around Manhattan, and I just look  at them and go, ugh, holding suits, knowledge. 
[00:19:00]  Stop it.  With your overly large newspaper that you have to fold to read right.  You're going for knowledge you'll never use.  Ugh.  Stop it.  Yeah, really.  Stop looking interested in that story.  Get the New York Post like everyone else and look at the pretty pictures.  Look at the pictures.  Turn to 13.  Turn to 13.  13!  Oh, my God!  Alert.  Wow.  One of the greatest pictures in recent years.  That depresses me.  She's so lovely.  It's just funny, though, that we all, like, she's pulling down the left side of this sweater. 
[00:19:30]  Nothing underneath it.  The sweater completely open.  Normally, that breast would flatten out.  Showing as much boob as you possibly can without being in, like, Playboy.  And that thing is not sagging.  It refuses.  It refuses.  If I was with my girl and we saw Scarlett Johansson looking like that, and she showed  any interest in me, I would take my elbow and drive it into my girl's face.  You would push her into oncoming traffic. 
[00:20:00]  Into a subway platform.  As I was talking to Scarlett, I would casually put my right foot out and boot her into the  path of the oncoming train.  And then go, I wonder where she went.  Let's go.  Jimmy would be beating a swath with his girlfriend of people out of the way so we can get to  her.  No, but as she was wedged between the train and platform with her arm propped up, like,  her energy being held in, I would tap her on the head and go, it's been real, it's  been nice, but it hasn't been real nice.  And then I'd leave with Scarlett. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut, I'd lick David Johansson just to get to Scarlett Johansson.  There you go.  A lot of people are like, hey, man, this drooling over Scarlett doesn't help without photos.  I can't find them online.  Just picture what she looks like.  And now picture her pretty much naked.  That's right.  And you can't find that picture online?  Yes, you can.  I'm sure.  Just Google Vavavoom.  Vavavavoom, 23 Skadoo.  We'll find it.  I'm sure if you look, maybe NewYorkPost.com.  Would NewYorkPost.com have it? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, we'll look.  Sometimes you go to the paper, they have it.  We'll look for it.  Just look.  Don't be so needy.  Daniel, Baton Rouge.  Don't confuse her, by the way, with Jennifer Wilbanks, the runaway bride.  Oh, I like the picture, the caption under the photo.  Of all the bleeping nerve?  No, it says, like, right under the photo, where the text is.  The one from the left.  Yeah, it says, an eye-opener.  Oh, really?  Because she's got those big runaway bride buggy eyes. 
[00:21:30]  Those big owl eyes.  She looks like the picture that they photoshopped of you with Ant with the wink.  Yeah, yeah.  With the eyes and the smile.  She looks like a psychopath.  Let's say hi to Daniel in Baton Rouge.  We've got to take a break here.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Morning.  I just want to say thanks for giving props to the Tigers.  I'm born and raised up in Michigan.  And my wife was asking me last night, she's watching the game with me.  She's like, what's so big about this game?  And I said, this brings back memories of 1984 when they won it all. 
[00:22:00]  And it's just awesome, man.  To watch these guys win it all again, it's awesome.  They're going to the World Series.  You know that.  They've got to be.  They're just playing with so much energy.  You know, these guys, they want it.  You know, they've got the heart.  There you go.  Well, like Ope said, don't count the Mets out, though.  They're in the same boat.  Hey, you guys, you're awesome.  Yankees are Mets and Tigers.  You know, you were saying that last week, and I was just like, that would be so awesome.  That would be a real exciting World Series.  All right, Daniel, thank you.  Yankees, thank you.  In other baseball news, Joe Torre was not fired. 
[00:22:30]  He's coming back next year.  I heard on the news this morning, driving in, that last year, Joe said he wasn't sure  if he even wanted to come back because of the way the season went.  He felt like he wasn't sure if he wanted to come back.  He goes, but this year, like, I'm really having fun, and I want to come back.  And I'm just thinking, why bring this guy back?  Because now you don't know, year to year, if the guy wants to be there or not. 
[00:23:00]  But, like, halfway through, when did he decide two years ago when he said he didn't really  enjoy himself, when did he decide he didn't really want to be there?  Was it the middle of the season?  Was it, here's, there's a guy that just doesn't, maybe next season he'll be like,  ah, halfway through, I don't want to be here again.  It's good to see a team, though, that has a manager for more than two years.  Yeah, more than two years is different than friggin', what, 15?  Speaking of old school, I mean, that's how it used to be. 
[00:23:30]  You had a manager forever.  And you went with him with the ups and the downs.  Connie Mack.  Yeah.  What do you got, Jimmy?  Cover the Daily News.  I like it.  I like the caricature.  There's just something about it that's really 1910-ish.  Oh, wow.  It's a caricature.  Was it Willie Randolph?  And it's like blackploitation pictures.  Yeah, it is.  It's like a Sambo.  That's like, this is like, on the cover of the news, there's like a 24-page playoff preview  wrap.  Well, the paper is having a lot of fun today. 
[00:24:00]  We've got to get into what's-his-name as a puppet there.  Kim Jong-il.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll talk about that.  We've got lots to do today.  Twitchels was on MTV last night.  I didn't see it.  You got an update for us, Anne, after the break?  Oh, yes, I do.  All right.  Hippie chick at Anne's house.  We'll talk about that today.  Damn little hippie chicks.  We'll talk about Barbra Streisand.  And maybe my humiliating experience last night.  Oh.  With what?  That's just a girl.  Of course.  Of course. 
[00:24:30]  Not just a thing.  It's humiliating.  No, no, it's not what I think, but I'm not surprised at whatever it is.  Did Coconut Willie make an appearance?  Coconut Willie.  Coconut Willie, hidden shame.  As well he should.  He didn't feel like coming out.  Now he cowered like ice water had been splashed upon my back.  He cowered and wept like a mealworm.  Let's see.  Okay.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  I came up with something years ago. 
[00:25:00]  Basically it says,  Whip him out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip him out Wednesday.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Let's go right to the phones.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  You're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's Josh in Jersey.  Josh, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up? 
[00:25:30]  Hey.  You guys have an awesome show.  Hope you're having a good morning.  But I have some exclusive information.  I work at a gas station in a hick town in Hunterdon County.  And this woman came in with this pickup truck.  Wow sticker.  Blasting O&A and everything.  And she got her gas.  And I didn't realize until she left, this woman was humongous.  Definitely could be the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  And I'm trying to get her fat carcass back to my gas station so I can bring her in.  Yeah, this contest is great.  But it has officially stalled.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  We haven't had a fatter girl than 430 pounds in, I think, two and a half weeks now.  Oh, man.  We had girls coming in like crazy.  We got up to 430 pounds in Cleveland.  That was Crystal.  She is the current leader.  And it looks like she's going to win $4,300 courtesy of Hootia57.  H57.com.  They still got like a few weeks, though, right?  A couple weeks left of this contest.  We're going to Halloween, yeah.  God.  And there's a finder's fee, Josh.  So if you're able to bring that woman in, obviously, it's going to be tough because she drove away already. 
[00:26:30]  But if you brought her in, you get $1,000.  You get a finder's fee of $1,000 for bringing the fatty in.  And that's the whole reason I called you guys because I know she's listening to the show.  Just bring your fat, beautiful self in here, please.  How far away can she have possibly gotten?  Well, honestly, she looks at least $500.  She was driving a Jeep Cherokee and the poor thing was basically riding on rims.  And we'll be cool to the fatties.  We got the pig mask. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, don't worry.  We got the shopping bag.  You can change your name.  We don't care.  We just got to get your weight.  Don't worry, you big, beautiful gals.  BBW.  BBWs.  Yeah, right ahead.  Just keep talking there, Josh.  No problem.  Big, beautiful woman.  I'm a BBW.  Are you?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, if she comes back, I'll bring her in.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  Thanks for the update.  Really, if there are any women out there that are thinking about doing this, give us a call.  We want to see how heavy you are. 
[00:27:30]  Maybe we can work out a deal.  I don't know.  You got to be 430 pounds, and it's $10 a pound thanks to H57 Hootia.  Lose weight for free at H57.com, okay?  All right.  Right.  Let's go to Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I want to thank you guys who mentioned it the other day on the air.  And last night of the week, there were a lot of people that, from what I'm hearing,  from the time it started at 2 o'clock until 9 o'clock, there were a whole load of people  that came down and reminded of funerals at 10 o'clock this morning over in Jersey City. 
[00:28:00]  I don't remember the name of the church, but...  I had the info all up on the websites and stuff, which is good.  He was the guy who ran the PalTalk room.  Ran the PalTalk fan room.  Probably one of our biggest fans.  He died out of nowhere.  Everyone is beyond upset about it.  Yeah, in his sleep.  My brother's in studio today because he went to the wake yesterday.  He represented for us and pulled an all-nighter and everything.  He was at the funeral home, and he said it was just unbelievable. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, Rich really touched a lot of people.  Yeah, there's a...  He was cool.  I got to say, you know, Rich's sister said to me,  thanks for loving my brother.  And I said to her, there was no way knowing Rich that you couldn't love him.  You know, he was that great a guy.  So, you know, rest in peace, Rich.  We'll miss you.  Well, how did you say his name?  I could never say his name.  He had the hardest to say PalTalk name ever.  Does anybody remember his...  The Solipsist?  Solipsist.  It was like the P and a C.  It was the most awful name to try to say out loud. 
[00:29:00]  And someone threw a YouTube video together, a look back.  It's a montage.  Oh, why?  Don't do that.  A montage with Rich just, with his arm around a million O&A pests.  I'm not going to lie to you, man.  Teary eyes.  Why do they do that?  Teary effing eyes.  I'm on my couch yesterday going, oh, my God.  Here come the tears.  You talk about the O&A community, and you see it in something like this, how it keeps 
[00:29:30]  going on after the show.  Yeah.  An event like last night.  These guys and girls just, you know, hugging each other and just being there.  It was pretty love.  Well, that happens a lot, too, but for different reasons.  Normally, that's alcohol.  Yeah.  It's very rare they actually do it for real.  The hugging turns into other things.  Yeah.  If you go to YouTube, you throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  The video is titled Remembering Rich.  It's done to end my life.  It's just like, oh.  Oh, my God.  That song is miserable at a wedding. 
[00:30:00]  That's just.  Yeah.  It's brutal.  But whoever put this together did a great, great job.  A great, great job.  We lost one of the good guys, man.  He was unbelievable for the show and obviously unbelievable, an unbelievable person.  So there you go.  I guess all the info is up on whackbag.com, right?  Yeah.  There's a picture with Twitzel.  There's a picture with Bill Burr.  Everybody.  Pictures from my brother's restaurant in Huntington.  Pictures from one of the ONA Traveling Virus shows.  There's just a whole montage going on. 
[00:30:30]  It's up on YouTube if you want to check it out for yourself.  But he was an uber fan and one of the nice guys, man.  Never harassed us.  Just.  Just.  Ah.  He just stood out, man.  He was just really, really, really cool and did a lot for the show.  Without being too pushy.  Correct.  He was just, he was just always there.  He was at every event we ever did.  Outside Letterman to support us, going on Letterman.  There's a picture of him and my brother at FH Riley. 
[00:31:00]  You just get to know too many people.  Huh?  That's the problem.  Yeah.  You know, when you get on a radio show and it's like this with fans that are really involved  and show up at a lot of the appearances and gigs and hang out together even outside of  the show.  It's just the stupid law averages.  But, you know, bad things are going to happen.  And then you got to deal with them.  All right.  Turn that off.  Try to be a goddamn hermit.  And what happens?  And the last picture I see is before Hawks stopped.  It was him and Keith Robinson. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Why do I not want to see Keith Robinson in a time of grief?  Dope that he is.  Ha, ha, he's stupid.  All right.  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike.  What's up?  Hey.  Man, you guys made me go out and get that paper.  Oh, you got the New York Post.  The Post.  Oh, my God, man.  I can't wait to get home tonight.  Did you get to page 13?  Oh, boy am I on 13.  Isn't it amazing?  Yeah, we talked about it some more during the break.  And I'm just, you know, because Tom Chieson came in and he was talking about the movie Scoop, a Woody Allen movie. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know.  I didn't see it.  I'd given up on Woody Allen movies forever.  And he watched the movie pretty much to see how much Scarlett Johansson would show.  And obviously she's not going to show at all.  She's waiting for the big payday in Playboy because it looks like she's more than willing.  She's just waiting for the right offer, you know?  And I'm just hoping she, like, you know, she gets in Playboy before, like, 50, like Farrah Fawcett did. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yeah, when they get into Playboy after their prime, when no one wants to see him anymore.  Forget Playboy.  Let's get her in Hustler.  I don't want Playboy with the hidden behind an Afghan shot and the T.A.  Oh, look, she's peeking around.  Oh, T.A.  Bosom swell.  Well, I want Hustler, I want her doing a somersault, grabbing, like, each ankle and spinning.  I want a disgusting, I want a medical shot.  You know, where they have to have her all the way on her back upside down so the boobs look like something. 
[00:33:00]  It's a awful spot.  It's going to get to the point where they're going to make her room upside down.  Just for the old broads that want to finally take it off.  You know, the couch is going to be on the ceiling and all that.  You've seen the shot where the older broad is laying on her back.  Yeah.  And they kind of put their hands together over their belly and use their biceps to push their bosoms together.  Right, right. 
[00:33:30]  And, all right, snap it.  Right.  Yeah, that's great.  Eventually, it's going to be couch on the ceiling, crazy glue the broad to the couch.  Crazy glue.  Have her hanging from the ceiling.  I love in Hustler when they do these shots, like the Victorian shot, the sex scene between  the Victorian, and all it is is a naked guy with, like, a Victorian jacket, and nothing  else is Victorian.  Maybe a couch that has a Victorian vibe to it, and she's got, like, a queen's crown on,  and she's just...  And that's it.  Oh, it's fantastic.  That's supposed to be, like, a period piece. 
[00:34:00]  And it's really hardcore.  Yeah.  It's really hardcore now.  Hustler is totally hardcore.  That's what I want to say, Scarlett.  Who is that, E-Rock?  Rachel Hunter.  Rachel Hunter.  Oh, yeah, Rachel Hunter.  That's, uh...  Yeah, I mean...  Is she wearing, um...  But, see, she has to be on her back to make her body look good.  Wait, she's not wearing, uh...  Bottoms?  Oh.  Wow.  Wow, she went old school, huh?  She really went old school.  She went old school.  My God.  I don't know what's going on there.  But there's a girl, Rachel Hunter, you would have loved to have seen her naked in her prime. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  She finally does it a couple years ago, you know, probably a decade past her prime.  And they use all the tricks.  Like, she's laying on her back, and her arms are stretched so far over her head to try  to, you know, tighten things up.  She looks good, though.  All right.  Moving on.  Twitchell's on True Life, Anthony, on MTV.  Yeah.  I watched this.  I forgot this thing was on.  We promoted it all day yesterday.  I DVR'd it, and then I was up, so I decided to watch it anyway, so I watched it. 
[00:35:00]  Did you love it?  They had three people with Tourette's, Twitchell's, and then they had this 16-year-old high school  girl who is just a mess.  The poor, poor little thing.  How great is that?  She can't testify who will listen to her.  Yeah, I'm sure he did.  She's screaming and cursing and just a twitching, like, mess where she's got to walk around  with an ice pack on her jaw because her jaw moves around all weird. 
[00:35:30]  Like, she is just a wreck.  Why does she hold the ice pack?  Because it hurts?  Yeah.  She's in pain all the time because she's, like, twitching.  They open up the scene with her trying to put on mascara, and it's like, what are you  doing?  Can these girls just go on a chorale?  Why do they?  She's almost taking her eye out.  And then she misses.  At one point, the mascara goes all over under her eye.  She looks like she belongs in Clockwork Orange.  She's yelling at her grandmother. 
[00:36:00]  Apparently, she just lives with her grandparents.  Don't know where the parents went.  Might have just dropped her off somewhere, twitching little baby mess.  Throw it out of the car window.  It's like 18 months yelling profanity.  They crack the window and just throw the kid out.  Goodbye.  I was telling Anthony, you know, you can prevent this, man.  You're pregnant, and the kicking is a little extra.  You know you're going to get one of these freaks.  That's when you have to start kicking.  Dr. Martin, Dr. Martin, Doc Martin to surgery. 
[00:36:30]  You've got to give me a high five for that.  Was that a setup, bro?  It was just like how we did in the office.  You get a stick of the day.  No, inside the show, we did that exact back and forth in the office.  Said, hey, that worked.  We'll try it on the air.  That's a good one.  Take you inside the show a little bit.  But she was a wreck.  And they would switch between her and Twitchels.  And a guy that I could swear we interviewed at the X Games.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  They call him Twitch.  He's all tattooed up on his neck.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And yeah.  Okay, yeah.  And he's got it.  But all he kind of does is kind of move his head a little bit.  And it's very dangerous for him because when he's approaching a jump, if he twitches his head, it kind of throws him off.  And they showed him at the end of it, he had taken a horrid spill, man.  Bike went up the ramp.  You know, they get some really unbelievable air.  And he fell off the motorcycle and just came straight down. 
[00:37:30]  Now you're just falling.  You're just falling like you jumped out of a building.  He lands on his feet, but his ankle breaks.  You see it.  And now he's a guy with Tourette's in a wheelchair.  But they say through physical rehab and stuff, and once he's bones to heal, he'll be fine.  And we interviewed that guy?  Yeah.  I could swear we interviewed him.  The motocross guys at the X Games, is that one of the most amazing things you've ever seen?  Yeah, it really is.  The crap they were doing?  What they're doing now is amazing.  But they had him.  So nice enough guy and everything. 
[00:38:00]  But as far as the Tourette's thing goes, not very interesting.  Interesting as far as his bike riding goes.  But he doesn't have it that bad.  But Twitchells, in all the times he's been in here live, I never felt sorry for the guy.  Watching that last night, I had nothing but pity for that poor son of a bitch.  Nothing but pity.  And I don't know if it's the editing or whatever they do, but I don't think so. 
[00:38:30]  Everything he did just brought pity.  Twitchells?  Yeah.  On the show.  He comes in.  It's either he's going out on a date and spilling a drink on this chick.  And he's getting shot down for a kiss goodnight.  He's living in his parents' basement with, by the way, a big Wizard of Oz poster over his bed.  No, he doesn't.  That was a little suspect.  Ew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ew.  I found that a little odd.  Other pictures on the wall. 
[00:39:00]  A few of some wrestlers that are kind of, you know, shirtless.  I'm not implying anything here.  I'll imply it.  He's a moe.  Off to see the Wizard, are you, sissy?  I saw that, yeah.  Oh.  How I wish I only had an unclipped Dominican friend.  Maybe the Wizard could stop your twitching.  Yeah, Kenny.  He was a wreck.  Ain't no attention to that horse's ass causing a ruckus on the china shop.  Step it on the dog. 
[00:39:30]  Fall off the road.  Nah, that was a twitching idiot.  Yeah, so he was really a mess.  And then they showed his studio appearance.  And I couldn't help but think, right when it started, I'm looking going, oh my god, this  looks just like an old Howard Stern show.  Why?  Because the camera coming up the hallway.  Oh, really?  I'm watching like it isn't even our show.  I'm watching it going, oh, look at this.  Oh, it's the same hallway.  I've seen this on TV. 
[00:40:00]  And he's in the green room and then into the studio where he proceeds to a twitch.  And Big A is shown prominently.  Child Star is shown prominently.  We get a good view of E-Rock producing, giving a go kind of thing.  Makes the show look very complex.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It looks like professionals?  It looks like professionals.  All right.  Hope gets a pretty good shot.  Yeah, I got to talk for once on TV.  Yeah, you get to talk. 
[00:40:30]  You really goof on the whole thing, though, which is funny.  You kind of look at the camera and have a snide remark.  I think we got it on tape.  And then I get a one billionth of a second shot where I blurt something out and it's taken  from like behind you.  And I'm looking at Twitchels over here.  So it's like the back of my head or something.  I really lost out on this appearance.  Yeah.  What did I say?  Jimmy Norton.  Was Jimmy shown at all?  What did I say?  Did they feature me? 
[00:41:00]  What did I say?  If E-Rock doesn't remember it, that's not good.  Yeah, I don't know.  Because Big A was in it.  Were you even here that day?  No Filter Paul.  Yeah.  You see it at one of the live shows, one of the comedy shows that Twitchels was doing.  You see No Filter Paul.  He's wearing an O&A shirt.  Twitchels is wearing an O&A shirt.  Were you watching live, Eric?  Did you watch it live?  Microphone.  Microphone.  No microphone.  Why bother?  Yeah, go ahead.  No, I watched it this morning.  Wow.  So glad I turned that on.  Thanks for adding. 
[00:41:30]  Thanks for contributing.  Kobayashi Maru, my friend.  Yeah.  We got to take a break.  We got some audio from Twitchels on True Life.  We could play some of that, right?  Yeah, definitely.  Do you really feel sorry for him now?  No, no.  I said the show itself brought about pity.  I could give a flying...  Oh, okay.  You know.  Yeah, all right.  I got you.  I want to see his faggoty wrestling posters and Wizard of Oz.  Oh, you got to see it, yeah.  Hang over his bed.  Actually, I have a DVR, and I want to watch it again a few times to see what else he's got 
[00:42:00]  in there, because I was so fixated on the Wizard of Oz and the nude wrestlers that I'm sure  there's other stuff I missed.  We'll finally send you over the edge, Bert Lahr's profile.  Right on.  And I can only speculate as to his relationship with his parents based on what I saw there.  He never talks about it.  He's never talked about it on the air.  But again, like reality shows do, you can only draw conclusions from what you see from that show. 
[00:42:30]  So the conclusion that I drew, and it could be completely wrong, I guess we could go to  Twitchells for this, is that I don't see a very loving relationship between him and his  father.  Well, now we got to have him back in.  We got to find out.  Because all the scenes with him and his dad seemed very cold, distant.  There was a hug at one point that just didn't seem like a very father-son type hug.  And I don't know.  The father's just run out of energy.  I think that might be it. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know.  Again, I'm speculating.  But I just felt more pity for him in this during any appearance.  He spent 18 years cleaning up spills.  He's had it.  He's had it.  When he gets so frustrated at the way his date went badly, and at the place they were at  the date, the restaurant, they made balloon animals.  This woman made balloon animals and made him a little balloon monkey.  And he took it home as a little memento, but it was shot down for the kiss at the end of  the night and everything.  He goes in and just starts stomping all over this balloon animal in his basement of his 
[00:43:30]  parents' house bedroom.  His bare stocking feet.  Yeah, in his bare stocking feet with his homoerotic posters on the wall.  It was really kind of sad.  Enough about the posters.  The gay posters on the wall.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got the audio from his appearance.  Also, coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, Tourette's Day.  Oh, Tourette's Day.  Yeah, we should have more details on that.  Love to get that little 16-year-old in here. 
[00:44:00]  Tourette's Day.  Oh, was she a mess?  Yeah, I like the little people.  They have a convention and stuff.  We're going to have our own convention.  I think this could be an ongoing feature, by the way.  Tourette's Day.  It would sound like a rainforest in here.  Woo, woo.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  We, ah, ah.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Call the Opie and Anthony show right now.  866-313-3. 
[00:44:30]  ONA, who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So, why'd you call?  The Lamy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony show.  At 866-313-BREE.  Hello.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:45:00]  By the way, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  That's right.  Boy, am I seeing stickers.  Yeah, the stickers are starting to pop up all over the New York area again.  That's really, really exciting for us.  A lot of them.  We're attempting the biggest comeback in radio history, by the way.  I think knock wood.  So far, so good.  So far, so good.  Because I'll tell you, it was a little depressing when we first got back onto XM two years ago.  Drive around, and by that point, I think there were a lot of people that had bought new cars and such. 
[00:45:30]  And I really wasn't seeing many Opie and Anthony stickers.  You'd be all excited.  You'd see one on a truck, like half torn off.  But now they're really starting to pop up again.  And they're brand new stickers.  Very happy about that.  Yeah.  Scarlett Johansson, she's celebrating Whip Him Out Wednesday, sort of, in the New York Post today.  Page 13 for all you New Yorkers out there.  And, oh, you don't even have to throw it up on the PalTalk camera anymore, Ant. 
[00:46:00]  We got it up on OpieandAnthony.com for the rest of the country.  Go to OpieandAnthony.com to check out this unbelievable picture of Scarlett Johansson in the paper today, okay?  Whip Him Out Wednesday, yes.  Do you want Cody to explain it from Indiana?  I hope he does it justice.  He's one of the faithful listeners.  Cody, what's up?  Make it fast.  All right, boys.  For the new listeners, Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Basically, you put a sticker on your car or your truck, you don't have a sticker, right, wow, in the dirt on the back of your trailer.  And the girls on Wednesdays will whip out their bosoms nicely if you're a fan of the show. 
[00:46:30]  But don't harass the women, boys.  They will do it on their own if they care enough.  Well, there's plenty of women out there that will just do this.  It's unbelievable.  Another great way to get a sticker is to show up December 4th, Zanies in St. Charles, Jimmy Norton.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Good one.  Very good.  And if you can't get a wow sticker, make a homemade wow and throw that on your car.  Amen.  And then just drive around.  There are women that will flash if they see the wow sticker.  I was just waiting for the listener there. 
[00:47:00]  What was his name?  Cody.  Yeah, I was waiting for Cody when you jumped in to go, well, okay, why don't you tell it, Opie?  Go ahead.  Well, I did jump all over him.  Because we've got to move on.  It's a very fast-paced show today.  We've got Kramer in Pittsburgh.  Kramer.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Love the show.  All right.  Thanks for saying so.  This is what's going on.  My wife's going to be giving birth within the next couple days.  I'm going to tape record and video record the birth.  First, I'm going to put it up on YouTube.  Second, I'm going to make you guys a special song.  I'll have clips from it from the delivery room. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, that'd be nice.  You know, we tried to get this done a while ago, and we failed miserably because you're  not allowed to have video cameras, I guess, when your wife is giving birth.  I thought you were at some point.  I don't know.  Probably certain policies in certain hospitals.  Yeah, they changed the rules because we want the women yelling and screaming and cursing  out their husbands as they're giving birth and play that audio on the air.  I wish I had it last time.  My ex broke my nose, but...  Jesus.  Well, if anyone has... 
[00:48:00]  Permission from the doctors, guys.  It's all good.  We're ready to go.  Well, maybe you can start this bit up.  We tried for many years to get this going, and we failed.  But maybe someone out there does have some great audio of their wife giving birth and  cursing her mouth.  We would play it on the show.  I bet because most of the tapes were used in courtroom lawsuits.  Yeah, right?  Then they were being shown at family gatherings.  What are you going to do?  Hey, look at that.  Wow.  She certainly is dilated.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Look at that baby crowning. 
[00:48:30]  It's probably more like, well, look, here's where the doctor made the mistake, and this is  why my baby is a waterhead.  It looks like, especially after the third kid, wow, it looks like he's wearing a loose-fitting  cardigan.  Turtleneck.  The kid's going to grow up with an affinity to turtlenecks.  Hey, you know, speaking of YouTube, we want to have an Opie and Anthony YouTube contest,  don't we?  Yes, we do.  I think we have more MacBooks to give away.  I'm not sure.  We'll be formally announced down the road a little bit. 
[00:49:00]  Down the road?  All right.  Well, even if Mac doesn't want to be part of this, we still want to do this contest.  Yep.  We want to get more Opie and Anthony videos up on YouTube, and the best Opie and Anthony  video to appear on YouTube, we'll give them a really, really, really good prize.  Yeah.  Because we've got some very creative listeners out there.  It doesn't have to just be clips of the show, either.  It doesn't have to be clips of us or anything.  You can make it yourself, based on the show, or whatever you want to do. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Whatever the hell you want to do that you think we'll find entertaining.  Yeah, we're going to work it out in the back room, in the Opie and Anthony lab, and we'll  have all the details.  The lab.  Yeah, we've got a lot of things we're working on in the lab.  The Opie and Anthony Institute.  And the labs of the Opie and Anthony Institute.  We're working on Tourette's Day.  What was the other idea we wrote down the other day?  We wrote something down.  Strangest thing hanging from your body.  Yes, that contest is on the way.  Remember that?  Another enchanting day here. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I went to college for this crap.  Let's go to Matt in Boston.  Matt.  What's the day, yeah?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, a big fan from way back when I met Tourette's Day is a big throwback.  I was fucking getting the old ONA CD.  You know how many fans I made in my dorm from California and Texas, like 1998, with those  Tourette's calls?  Oh, the old Tourette's call.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah.  That's going back quite a ways.  Yeah, the whorehouse.  You know what? 
[00:50:30]  Maybe we can play Tourette's Whorehouse going into break.  We haven't played any of that old stuff in a while.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  And the worn WoW stickers here in Boston are getting replaced with fresh ones, but it never  died.  All right on.  Thank you, Matt.  It's good to come back alive.  And I hear we got billboards up in Boston.  That's exciting for us.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Matt.  No problem.  Okay.  We got Psycho Tourette's Chick.  We got Twitchels.  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  Psycho Tourette's Chick is pretty cool.  Yeah.  They wound up putting those implants. 
[00:51:00]  They do this deep probe kind of implant things where they take these things that amount to  huge nails and drill holes in your head and put these probes in your brain that go down  into like the center of your brain.  And there's like a gap between the two probes.  And then there's a radio frequency thing that you wear.  There's these implants that go in your lower back and a little remote control that you 
[00:51:30]  use that you're supposed to attune this electrodes, the electrodes in your head, and it's supposed  to keep you from having Tourette's.  Wow.  And this girl's Tourette's is so bad that she actually went through this procedure.  She had no choice.  She's a mess.  She gets out, and they showed her a couple of months later, and she's still the same.  Oh, really?  Except her head's shaved now, so she has to wear a wig.  Oh, great.  So that's pretty much it.  Fifty years from now that we look at that radio control thing, the way we look at like  the old turn knobs on television, it's like you had to put that in your head. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, like the big clamp and hacksaw during the Civil War, just lopping legs off.  That's what kind of medicine that'll look like.  I have the cue of a Tourette's, by the way, but nobody will listen to me medically.  It's where you grab them by the lapels, and you give them a good slap, and you go,  Just stop it already!  Shaking.  It's called the Bogart.  The Humphrey Bogart.  You just grab them, smack them a few times, tilt them, man up.  You look stupid, see?  See?  See?  You want to go psycho chick or twitchels?  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  I think a little psycho chick maybe first. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah?  All right.  Yeah, save the twitchels thing.  This was MTV, true life.  You know?  Body, too.  She had a great bottom.  Yes.  Well, for a 16-year-old girl.  I noticed that, too.  She's in good physical condition.  She was in good condition, yeah.  I guess she's always moving.  She's very physically fit.  Physically fit.  I'd date her.  I mean, for a body like that, it's like you'd tolerate the screaming and cursing and twitching  and ice pack on the face.  Yeah, ice pack.  Her screaming at her grandmother to paint her toenails. 
[00:53:00]  Really?  Yeah.  She can't do anything.  What do you do every time you walk by a church in that condition?  Do you just look at it and go, thanks for nothing?  Thanks for nothing.  Listen, it's one of those situations, too, where, and we were briefly talking about this  in the office.  If it was an ugly girl, you would not care about this girl at all.  You'd want to drill your fist into a cheek.  I just want to tell her to shut up and stop twitching.  They go on a little trip, her and her friends, to Disneyland, and at one point, she gets so 
[00:53:30]  upset with her Tourette's and everything else, and she's just kind of bitchy anyway.  She's a 16-year-old girl, and they're naturally just bitchy.  That she just plops down on the ground and won't move, and all her friends are trying  to tell her, come on, let's go.  We're here to have fun and everything, and they tolerate her.  Like, if she was some pig, they'd just leave her.  They'd dump her out, and it's a twitchy world or something.  Just push her out of the boat, let her drown. 
[00:54:00]  But they tolerate her, and one of the guy friends are there with her and has his arm around her  and kind of taking her around Disneyland.  But it's just because she's a cute girl.  Yeah.  If she was a slob or something, she never would have made MTV.  Well, let's play some of this audio here.  Jello-y mess.  Psycho Tourette's chick on True Life.  By the way, another freak show for TV.  That's all this is.  Yep.  MTV making believe they're getting something done.  Oh, yeah.  And turning people on to Tourette's.  No one gives a crap.  They want to see these people miserable. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, no better than what we do.  How awful is that?  I mean, you threw up the wrong gang sign to get shot because your hands are...  Hands twitching.  You're trying to wave and throw up a W by mistake?  Oh, no.  Did the Tourette's Foundation get a lot of donations last night after this aired?  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  You looked.  You felt bad for a little while, but mostly you were like, wow, this is a cool freak show.  Freak show, yeah.  This is something I don't get to see while I'm walking around every day.  You watched, you laughed, you cleaned yourself off, you went to bed. 
[00:55:00]  Got a little snooze.  All right, living with Tourette's is hard, but she still has her pride.  Oh.  I have very severe Tourette's.  I'm like a prisoner in my own body.  My life is hell.  I have no control over my arms, my neck, my head, my ribs, my stomach, my back, my legs.  It feels like an electric shock.  Just running through my body.  It's very, very painful.  I like wearing makeup because I have to wear my pride. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, I bet she has control over her.  Poo-ha.  Oh.  Poo-ha.  You think?  Nothing beat her putting on mascara, though.  Yeah.  My God, it was so, it was like watching a horror movie.  It was like watching Saw.  I was waiting for it to just go right through her eyeball.  For it to just thrust it into her peeper.  No control of that mouth, so you don't have to ask for certain things.  I don't know.  Nah, that's all right.  I'll pass.  I like it.  Do ya?  Here she is flipping out while asking for lunch. 
[00:56:00]  Just asking for lunch.  Just lunch.  What do you want for lunch?  I don't know.  Well, there's egg beaters.  How about egg beaters?  That's not all we have for lunch.  How about egg beaters?  No!  That's not all we have for lunch.  A little nicer attitude would help.  All the frustration.  Who the hell is telling her?  Now I'm defending the psycho chick.  The grandma saying a nicer attitude would help?  A nicer attitude would help.  Yeah.  Well, the grandma probably knows that there's the Tourette's and then there's just the she's  kind of a bitch.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  I think grandma has to hold on to a paint shaker or something for an afternoon to see how it's  like.  A lot of a paint shaker.  How it's like.  I see what kind of mood she's in by the end of the day.  I think grandma's got enough on her plate at this point in her life where you got this  shaking 16 year old and the daughter that you must have had that had this girl that  is nowhere in the picture.  No.  They don't show the kids at all?  The parents at all?  No.  Apparently the grandma takes care of her. 
[00:57:00]  Parents are off gallivanting.  Yeah.  Just gave up.  Gave up on her.  They knew when she was like seven years old and they went to give her her first bubble  bath and she twitched and twitched until the whole bathroom filled up with bubbles.  Put her in the tub with a little Mr. Bubba.  Right?  It's just coming out of the bottom of the bathroom door.  It's just a mess.  Of all the frustration that comes through with Tress, I'd lash out at people.  I will.  Why don't you make me some some vegetables? 
[00:57:30]  No, I want some some vegetables.  I'd like to see somebody go through it and not lash out at somebody.  No!  No!  Would you stop one second?  Stop.  Ah!  That was a long outburst.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was, uh, she would use it a lot, though.  Like, she would have an outburst and say, I have Tourette's.  Like, she's telling everybody. 
[00:58:00]  That's better, though.  Because this way people know what's going on and they don't think that, like, you're just  a creep.  I think that helps people to ask Tourette's.  I don't know why it helps.  But to people that she knows.  Like, her grandmother, she would lash out and her friends at school, like, she would  lash out and curse at them and then just go, I have Tourette's.  Maybe that's part of her Tourette's.  Well, maybe it is.  You never know what the hell she's saying.  If it's part of her Tourette's, she's just being a bitch.  Oh, I say tomato.  You go...  Well, here she is, uh, cursing out Grandma, who's just trying to help her out. 
[00:58:30]  Grandma.  Poor woman.  Grandma's trying to paint her toenails.  You can't get it off, Grandma.  You're being careless.  What?  You're being careless.  You're being careless.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Stupid old broad.  She scolds the old bag for being careless.  She's being careless.  She missed the spot on her toenail.  Oh, life just stinks.  You're being careless. 
[00:59:00]  Grandma must have had a great life.  She raised her daughter.  Couldn't wait to be a grandma.  Time for herself and her husband, who's still alive, too, the grandfather.  This was the time they were supposed to be taking cruises.  Yeah, the golden years.  Right, right, right.  Get an RV and take it to the Grand Canyon.  Instead, it's the yuck years.  It's paint the toenails of some shaking bitch.  Right.  Half granddaughter, half George C. Scott.  Please hear that voice change.  Grandma, you're being careless.  I'm careless.  I won't have any yellow belly painting my toes. 
[00:59:30]  Get the toenail, get the nail polish remover and take it off.  Take it off.  Take it off.  Careless.  You're being careless.  Careless.  Ooh, what's this?  Let's say hi to Dave in Wisconsin.  Dave.  Good morning, boys.  Sounds intriguing.  Hey, Dave.  Hello, Dave.  How's it going?  Hey, it's going pretty good, Dave.  Yeah, hey.  How's it going in Wisconsin? 
[01:00:00]  It's raining.  It's cold.  It's going to start snowing.  Cold rain going to start snowing.  Let's go, Dave.  What do you got for the show?  Hey, I think Opie's got the line of the day.  Which one?  Hey.  Grandma's got to hold on to a paint shaker for a day.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I think that's got me B.  We'll find out later.  Got to put that one there.  I think you'll make it.  Thanks, Dave.  Let's go to Lori in Wisconsin.  Lori, you know Dave?  Hey, Opie.  Hey.  I actually think you have it for the line of the day when Anthony was talking about  Twitchell's MTV show and he saw you on there and he said, oh, I finally got to talk on 
[01:00:30]  TV.  Oh.  That's line of the day?  Line of the day that he had a line?  No, that's just sad for me.  Thanks, Lori.  All right.  Thank you, Lori.  Hey, let's go back to Psycho Terrestric.  All right.  Yeah, the grandma.  We backed it up so you could hear her voice change.  You can't get it all, Grandma.  You're being careless.  Careless.  Oh, my God. 
[01:01:00]  Careless.  Oh, my God.  What would you do in that case?  Say, am I?  And I'd take garden shears and show her how careless I could be around a toe.  With toes.  Just nip a toe off.  Nip that little toe off.  You're being careless.  Girl, I'm sick of it.  She starts doing it herself because she's so peeved at her grandma.  Yeah.  And then I think it was more out of spite because I saw it visually, saw it.  It wasn't so much a Tourette's. 
[01:01:30]  She puts her foot up on a chair, on an upholstered chair, and she's polishing her nails and just  goes, ah, twitches and makes this big, long line of nail polish on the chair.  See, Grandma?  It's all upset with her grandma for missing a spot.  If I was raising her, I would never feed her anything like pudding that could stain.  All her meals would be water and dry toast.  Go ahead, throw it all you want, stupid.  I'll just pick it up.  I'll dust-fack it.  And when the toast got stuck in the toaster, I'd make her take it out. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, go out there and get it with a fork.  And no, you don't get to unplug.  A little adventure.  It might fix her.  Huh?  It might fix her.  Yeah, it might.  Zap.  A little shock treatment never hurt anyone.  Grandma, you're being very careless.  I would prefer it if you did it.  All right, here we go.  I'm going to keep myself.  I'm fine, thank you.  I backed up the clip again.  We're in one of those situations.  It happens on the Opie and Anthony show where we're attempting to go forward, but we have  to keep going backwards because it's too much fun.  You didn't get it all, Grandma.  You're being careless. 
[01:02:30]  Stupid.  Melissa, get your foot off.  I don't care.  It's not going to do it at all.  You can't.  F*** it.  F*** it.  And f*** you.  I can't.  Whoops, I got it on the chair.  Oh, well.  F***.  I hate you.  Sometimes I think, oh, my God, you know, I can't handle this anymore.  And then I think, what do parents do that have terminally ill children?  Get a break after a while.  And that's how you have to deal with it.  Grandma, come, come, come.  Like her. 
[01:03:00]  She's going to live with this forever.  And just want, you just want live today today, man.  I'm just trying.  I'll throw in as many as I can today.  You just want it today.  You came to play.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  That's horrible.  To deal with it.  Grandma, can you come do my other one, please? 
[01:03:30]  You need it.  Not be careless.  The second one.  Can you count?  One, two, three.  That was a spiral, sir.  Because now you can count all over me.  You know what?  Keep on that.  Have Tourette.  The way she's talking, she sounds like every woman to me.  This isn't Tourette.  You're right.  This is just every woman.  Oh, sorry.  I got the wrong tape here.  Yeah.  One, two, three.  She's just wrong with you.  This is your careless.  One, two, three.  I understand what she's going through. 
[01:04:00]  She's a beautiful girl trapped inside her body.  Wow.  Thank you.  Can you count all over me?  Okay, no.  I mean, I have to rest.  Damn it.  That's the one I love the best.  Get your...  I have Tourette's!  Come on!  She would do that a lot. 
[01:04:30]  Just yell like that.  I have Tourette's in that high-pitched scream.  Ugh.  I'm working the judges for line of the day.  Oh, are you?  Oh, the crap that goes on while we try to do a radio show.  That's illegal.  I know it is.  You're part of the competition.  I think I just...  Keep it fair, Judge.  Keep it fair.  I just disqualified myself, I think.  I'm like, see?  Someone else liked it. 
[01:05:00]  I went and got to hit the feet back to bed.  I got to admit it.  Working him instead of doing the stupid radio show with you guys.  All right.  What's the last clip here?  Same thing happens when Grandma is doing girls' hair.  So here we go.  Yeah.  More outbursts.  Alyssa, is your hair done?  Yeah.  It's past you.  Yes!  Yes!  Alyssa?  Come on, Alyssa.  Okay, let's go back.  You know what?  No, Alyssa, you don't.  My hair on!  Come here and I'll do it real quick. 
[01:05:30]  Hello!  Turn off.  There's bumps.  There is bumps on my hair!  Alyssa, I'm going to the airport.  There's bumps on my hair!  You're f***ing up!  All right, I'm f***ing everything up, and I'm leaving.  I'm not going.  That's it.  It's not going.  I'm not going!  Stop it!  I'm not going!  Screw this!  Dude, that is a nightmare. 
[01:06:00]  Screw this!  Imagine if you have to fly with her.  Oh.  Air Marshall's tackling your grand deliverance for three minutes.  She's not trying to break into the cockpit.  They're bomb!  It sounds like she's saying cockpit, but they're actually two separate words.  She can't help herself.  Oh my God.  Yeah, you hear her screaming?  The grandmother was trying to, like, she was complaining about her hair.  So the grandmother pulls it back into some kind of ponytail thingy, some kind of do, and  puts a little rubber band or something.  And then she runs her hand over the top of her head. 
[01:06:30]  And apparently, if you don't catch it all to pull into the ponytail, her hair was bumpy.  So she just went off that her hair was bumpy and stormed out of the room.  Just shaking and twitching and screaming.  You know what song comes to mind when I hear that?  Run to the hills!  Yeah, just get out of there.  There's no way.  Everyone wonders in their head how much you can take.  No way!  That's above and beyond.  But she did storm off in those pink sweatpants.  Sweat slacks. 
[01:07:00]  Those little sweatpants.  Pink sweatpants.  Her hair should be bumpy from having her head caved in with a hammer.  What do the back of her sweatpants say?  Shaky instead of juicy?  Shaky.  Yikes.  Yeah, a total disaster.  Oh my God, what a nightmare.  A nightmare on Earth.  It's fun to watch, though.  Yeah.  Huh?  Yeah, of course.  Believe me, it should be fun to hook up with certain things.  It's fun because we don't have to deal with this. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Sorry I'm moving and shaking so much.  Don't be.  Don't be.  All right.  Well, I watched some of the Twitchels stuff during the break,  and it's nowhere near as good as Psycho Chick.  No, she's pretty psycho, but we know Twitchels,  and it's just, it's not so much his Tourette's as it is his pathetic life.  Yeah.  The Tourette's is secondary to him.  It's just his pathetic life.  He's lucky.  Living in his basement, the parents' basement.  He's lucky he has Tourette's.  That's an excuse for being an ass.  Yeah.  He didn't have Tourette's. 
[01:08:00]  He would have to face the fact that he's a boob named Lou.  He would just be a bum living in his parents' basement.  And then there's one part where he's all happy and proud that he's getting out of his parents' house,  and before the special even stops filming, he's back into his parents' basement again.  How many people.  Like something went awry.  How many people with Tourette's were boiled alive because they thought they were witches?  Witch.  There are witches.  Yeah, the evil spirit.  Yeah, that's kind of something I guess we got to ask him about. 
[01:08:30]  You go to, you know, all the other guys have their kids playing T-ball.  Look at my son.  He hit a base hit.  Really?  Mine's over there yelling the C-word, eating dirt.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  They throw him in the league and he strikes out before the pitcher even throws the ball.  The other team, the team has to act supportive.  Like, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Good eye.  It's a slow pitch.  Strike one, strike two, strike three. 
[01:09:00]  But that was only one pitch.  Strike one, strike two, strike three.  All right.  Sit down.  Come on.  We won't even count the out, you nothing.  Just let him have a turn.  Yeah, just let him have a turn.  Yeah, I don't know.  Let's look supportive.  Jesus.  He runs to first.  Like, anyway, even after he's struck out, they just leave him there.  Like, whatever.  His run won't count.  Yeah, that's it.  Who cares?  Just run around him.  If you can. 
[01:09:30]  Should I go left?  Should I go right?  I don't know.  Yeah, he's just a disaster in that.  His father drops him off at his gigs and stuff.  All right.  I don't know.  Can he drive?  Something going on.  No, he says he could if he wanted to.  I guess there's no law against it, but he's opted not to for his own and others' safety,  I guess.  Yeah.  Because he's really, like, twitching.  That wheel would be, like, in that car coming at you. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  DWI.  Oh, yeah.  He'd just be getting pulled over all the time.  Hey, you were weaving.  Yeah.  Driving while idiotic.  Stupid little abbreviation joke that was.  Deserved nothing and it got nothing.  This is why.  DWI.  Guess what that stands for.  Sit down, folks.  Put on those laughing hats.  This is my 10th DUI this afternoon.  Damn it.  Ah, it's the only virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  I can walk on my hands. 
[01:10:30]  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction we want to exploit,  you can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during  the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this s***.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:11:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on this fine Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Get the WOW on your cars and trucks and scooters and bicycles.  Bicycles.  Wheelchairs.  WOW stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  There are women out there that will flash you.  It's been happening for, uh, WOW, a decade, Anthony. 
[01:11:30]  We started WOW a decade ago back in Boston.  My God.  And it continues to this very, very day.  There are women that will do this and are doing this as we speak.  But the show goes by so fast, we just can't spend too much time on it, unfortunately.  On anything.  Man, the old days, we would do, like, 20 minutes on Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Take WOW sightings from people.  Oh, just.  I can't do that anymore.  I mean, the phones are lit.  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Every Wednesday with guys looking, girls doing.  We used to actually talk women through the act.  Yeah, that's cool, too.  We could do that today if you want.  No.  No?  Health won't allow it.  Uh, our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Really fast.  We got to go to Chad in South Dakota.  Chad, what's up?  Hey, what's up, gentlemen?  Hey, Chad.  Funny man, Jimmy Norton.  You nailed it with eating dirt and saying the C word during Line of the Day.  We started this Line of the Day competition as a goof, but it's really, like, getting competitive. 
[01:12:30]  And there's a lot of lines today already.  Hey, Jimmy, uh, anything about Lucky Louie getting renewed?  Uh, no.  Oh, I ain't heard nothing.  Well, patched out, gentlemen.  Tomorrow morning, uh, Rick Shapiro from Lucky Louie's in, Louie's calling in.  So, it should be a lovely show.  All right.  Very nice.  Thank you, Chad.  Be well, Chad.  Godspeed.  All right.  All right.  We got to say hi to Bill Burr in studio.  Hey, guys.  How you been?  We haven't seen Bill in a while. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, since something happened, I kind of blocked it out.  Bill disappeared for a while.  We hadn't seen him.  No, I was in rehab.  I had some booze.  I went off on the Jews.  And now I'm back.  Yeah.  You're better now, right?  Yeah, I am.  I was in booze.  And I'd just like to apologize to Hollywood.  Looks like the shock treatment worked.  Yeah, it did.  You're all good again, huh?  I got an hour-long special with Katie Couric coming up.  Everyone is asking.  It's like, where's Bill been?  Have you talked to Bill?  How's Bill? 
[01:13:30]  Bill's fine.  Shut up.  Yeah, I was probably over it the next morning.  Bill's a professional, first of all.  You're a professional.  No, I was pissed.  I was pissed.  Of course you were pissed.  Jimmy gave me a nice talking.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A good talking to perhaps a bit more.  It was actually a very tender moment.  I tried to help Bill through it in my own selfish way.  Sometimes you feel better if your pants are off.  And normally I'd be freaked out about something like that. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  Because it's Jimmy.  And even when he does stuff like that, he's still adorable.  Of course.  Yeah, it was no big deal.  A couple of men worked through something.  Well, Dave from New Jersey wrote a song for you, Bill,  that we're supposed to play when you come back.  A song called Cleveland Sucks.  Basically, I mean, we talked about this after it happened,  but the ONA traveling virus, when we hit Philly,  it was just a crazy, crazy crowd.  And some of the comedians were getting booed for really no reason.  It's just sport for them down in Philly. 
[01:14:30]  We understand that.  They proved it again last weekend with T.O., by the way.  I was dying laughing when I saw that.  And I was sitting with my girl,  and they were showing all the Eagles fans getting ready for Terrell Owens.  I go, you see that?  I go, picture 10,000 of them with their jerseys on.  I mean, it wasn't that bad.  There was more like 1,000 of them in the middle up in the lawn seats,  but they might as well have been T.O.  Yeah.  Their chant was O.D. instead of T.O.  All that stuff is hilarious as long as it's not directed at you.  Yeah, once it's directed at you, it's like, hey, wait a minute. 
[01:15:00]  This isn't funny.  Yeah, I don't like these guys.  But when I watch it, yeah, snowballs at Santa Claus.  Yeah.  So there was no reason to boo Bill Burr in Philly.  They booed Jimmy Schubert, who came across as a bit hacky for our crowd,  to be honest.  And Jimmy Schubert ignored the boos, which was the worst thing you could do  because the boos got louder, and he tried to plow through his material.  At that point, it was over, Johnny.  And then they booed hometown hero Don Marrera, which was a little strange.  Yeah.  Only like at the end of his set.  He had a really good set. 
[01:15:30]  And then Bill Burr, they thought they would just continue,  and Bill Burr's like, I ain't taking this.  And then he took on the crowd.  It's legendary at this point.  It is now legendary in the comedy community.  Yeah, we've talked to people.  Everyone has viewed the video.  What really happens is they were so crazy at that point,  and the show was so long that when I came out,  I knew my first bit was going to be too slow.  So I jumped into the middle of this stupid bit on cell phones.  Not even the beginning.  I jumped in the middle.  How about those cell phones, people?  Yeah, these things crazy. 
[01:16:00]  And I'm like, why am I talking about this?  So I raced, then I went to the Hitler last name bit,  and I didn't realize you guys had been playing on the radio the whole week,  so they had already heard it.  Oh, no.  First few jokes, I got nothing.  I vaguely remember going, you guys aren't going to laugh at that?  And then they started booing.  And then...  We love that bit, too.  All hell broke loose.  It was an amazing, amazing display by you.  You're like a one-man wrecking crew.  Childhood anger.  It was great.  And then, like I've said before, your knowledge of Philadelphia, 
[01:16:30]  where you were talking about politicians and sports figures and icons and monuments,  just your sheer knowledge stunned me.  For the new listeners, just to bring him aboard,  obviously Bill threw his material out and just attacked everything about Philly.  The only thing I had, I had the first half of that Rocky thing.  Like, I had made fun of them years ago about the Rocky thing,  but I never thought to incorporate Joe Frazier,  so that aspect of it was new.  The video's on YouTube. 
[01:17:00]  It's still getting viewed a thousand times a day.  He hammered them to the point where when he was leaving,  they gave you a standing ovation and applauded.  It was amazing.  The video's up.  Comedians love it.  Every comedian we've talked to is like,  oh, I've downloaded that thing.  I've seen that on YouTube.  It's amazing.  It's our first video.  And then we went to Cleveland.  Well, it's our first video, just really fast,  it's our first video on YouTube that we have something to do with  that is over 100,000 views. 
[01:17:30]  Thanks to Bill Burr.  Not even a video comes close to that.  You know what the problem was, Bill?  It was the fact that it just had happened in Philly.  It could have been anyway.  If Jesus Christ had been up there and been booed in Philly  and had a comeback like you did,  well, he had quite a comeback himself, didn't he?  He would have gotten booed in Cleveland.  It was one of those things where they wanted to challenge you  because you were the big gun.  You were the guy that shut up Philly, the Philly booers. 
[01:18:00]  So they wanted to test you, and they wouldn't let up,  and you had had it at that point.  It just felt stupid.  It was stupid.  You're going to pretend to boo me,  then I'm going to pretend to get mad like,  why, I ought to?  It was Caddyshack 2.  It really was.  It was Caddyshack was great, and it was Caddyshack 2.  Going back to the Philly appearance, too,  everyone has their favorite line.  Mine is one minute left in the period.  In the period.  My brother, what's yours?  When he suddenly says, oh, I bought a computer today. 
[01:18:30]  He's out of nowhere.  He's going to go back into it.  Going back into the action.  The counting off of the minutes.  Yeah.  Because every comic has the countdown.  It's not even a clock.  It's a TV screen on the stage.  And this was brought out directly because of Patrice O'Neal.  It's the Patrice clock.  Because the red light and the bolt of lightning and lasers  that burn out your retinas wasn't good enough to get Patrice off.  Off the stage.  So there's a TV monitor at the foot of the stage, 
[01:19:00]  and it counts down.  You see how many minutes.  You've got 14, and then 13, 12, 11.  It counts down.  And every time that thing ticked down another minute,  you would call it off to the crowd.  Ten more minutes.  I'm not going anywhere, people.  It was brutal and brilliant.  I loved it.  I like five minutes left, and I'm still selling my CD after the show.  Yeah, that was another great line.  Oh.  Yeah.  It was an event.  And that's the point we made after the Cleveland disaster, 
[01:19:30]  because then we went to Cleveland.  And Cleveland, we've talked to a lot of people since,  and they were just trying to have fun.  At your expense, unfortunately.  Yeah, I felt like that.  They didn't mean anything by that,  but they all saw the video on YouTube.  So they figured, all right,  when Bill Burr hits the stage here in Cleveland, our hometown,  we're just going to start booing him.  And a lot of people said after the show  that was just their way of showing love to you.  Yeah.  But it was a tough position to put you in,  because now you're like, well, what do I do?  I did that.  That was a moment in time,  and that's what we said on the radio the next day or that Monday. 
[01:20:00]  We're like, guys, man,  that was a moment in time in Philly.  That's never really going to happen again.  Just let it be the moment,  and let Bill move on with his life and his comedy.  Yeah, it was like, Philly, they really were drunk.  They really were booing me, and I really got pissed.  And then Cleveland.  Cleveland, I felt like Gallagher.  Like, they were like, come on, smash the watermelon.  That's it.  They wanted you to smash the watermelon.  Ugh.  But thank God a trouserless Jim Norton explained it to me later.  You really can't help but listen when his pants are off. 
[01:20:30]  He's the good ambassador of the Opie and Anthony show.  Holding his cheeks, smacking on his face, we laugh.  Oh, come on, you.  Get out of here.  Really makes you forget about whatever was ailing you.  Yeah, well, just kind of sort of, you know,  you know what ailment you have coming.  So they booed Bill when he went on the stage in Cleveland,  and it was just like, what are you guys doing?  It had nothing to do with it.  They actually cheered when I came out.  And then the second the cheering ended, the booing started.  That was just them showing, look,  and we saw the video, we heard about what happened to you,  and it just didn't work. 
[01:21:00]  It didn't.  So Bill had a whatever set.  You know, that wasn't the Bill Burr we know and love,  which sucked, because we had a perfect comedy show at that point,  and it was kind of a bummer, I'm not going to lie to you.  And then, you know, I kind of knew, like, in the beginning,  when I was walking out and I went to go do some local radio there,  and I walked by and I was getting booed as I was walking in the parking lot,  and I was just, like, trying to talk myself down.  That's only six people.  Yeah.  They're not really good.  That's not going to happen when I hit the stage.  Yeah, you were in a little bit of a tizzy. 
[01:21:30]  Everybody had come up to me, too.  I felt like dead man walking.  I was just sitting there backstage like, dude, you're going to be fine.  You're going to be fine.  These people are going to be fine.  Everyone knew it was coming.  You're like in Platoon.  I got a bad feeling about this one.  Everybody got a bomb sometimes, Rich.  But let's say it again, seriously,  because it's important to Bill in his career.  That really was a moment that happened in Philly.  It's on YouTube.  You can watch it a million times and pass it on to your friends, whatever.  But let the guy be. 
[01:22:00]  He's a really funny comedian.  It's stupid if you try to recreate it.  He's a really funny guy, and it's over.  Sometimes there's just moments, and that's what it is, and that's it.  But I've done a couple clubs since then.  And it's fine.  Yeah, yeah, good.  That's all you're worried about.  People don't understand the way comedy works.  There's a band, again, you want a certain song.  You behave a certain way.  They play the song.  With comedy, man, it just does not work that way.  It's not what we do.  Really fast.  Dave from New Jersey wrote a song called Cleveland Sucks  for when Bill Burke finally comes in.  And here he is finally about a month later. 
[01:22:30]  He would have been in.  I've been busy.  He was busy.  I don't know if this song is good.  I've been busy.  Dave from New Jersey sometimes writes some great song parodies for us.  So let's see what this is about real fast.  All the fans that were booing him, you know where they come from.  With such a crude attitude, Cleveland's where they belong. 
[01:23:00]  All the frigging jerks who are probably out of work through Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks.  I guess their city is a lot like Billy, yeah.  Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks.  Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks.  Bill Burke knows and he don't care.  He got his shots in, too.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a dumb man. 
[01:23:30]  The Cleveland Browns suck, too.  All the Clevelanders who are heckling Bill Burke prove.  Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks.  Cleveland's nickname is a mistake by the Blake, cause Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks.  Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks, Cleveland Sucks.  All right, Dave from New Jersey, you're now starting trouble because we've seen this happen before. 
[01:24:00]  We're trying to get to the point where all the cities get along.  We've seen how this spins out of control and then the cities start attacking each other.  We can't have that.  Where's he from?  Well, he's from Jersey.  Yeah, Jersey.  He's not helping anybody.  Oh, wow.  Remember in the old days?  Jersey.  I know.  I'm an easy target.  Right.  Remember the old days?  The cities would start attacking each other.  Yeah.  It would get ugly out there.  Yeah.  We could have a Bill Burr Your City Sucks contest. 
[01:24:30]  This is hilarious.  I'm just trying to put the boos behind me and it just keeps going on.  I'll tell you what's funny too.  This comedian, Josh Snead, he opened for me in Tampa.  He got booed on one of those Def Jam shows and he immediately calls me and I just started  laughing like, what am I, the go-to boo guy now?  Yeah, now you're the guy.  Yeah, right.  You're the motivational speaker for booed comedians.  He just, he doesn't want to be known for that.  Like we said, it was a moment. 
[01:25:00]  But the Bill Burr Your City Sucks contest could be fun.  It could be a lot of fun.  I know.  Because Cleveland's not going to take that.  They're not?  No.  This is why he's the ringmaster.  I know.  Well, he's sitting there as he's saying, Bill, we don't want you to be known about this.  This is a great bit.  This is a bit and your name is going to be attached to it.  You know, I rarely do this, Bill, but I will for you.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the European Anthony show.  I'm dead serious.  I want people to enjoy your comedy. 
[01:25:30]  I really believe that was a moment in time.  Do you see the lack of eye contact?  Yeah.  I can look at you.  I know you're as psychotic as me.  I know what's going on in your head.  You think I don't know what's going on in your head?  You know what?  That's a good contest.  What?  To see who's the biggest psycho.  Me or you.  I would take that challenge.  It would be, I think it'd be a tough one.  I thought I had you.  I thought I had you beat as far as psycho until that time when you guys had that fan down  on the ground.  Oh, yeah.  Whatever you were screaming in his ear.  You were just screaming in his face. 
[01:26:00]  Why are you at that now?  What?  What?  What?  What happened?  I don't know.  Was that you?  What happened?  What?  No, that was no act.  That was no act.  What happened?  That wasn't Opie, the radio guy.  What?  That was Greg Hughes, angry guy.  Fresh from interrogating in Guantanamo Bay.  What?  What happened that day?  No memory whatsoever.  Yeah, you blanked it out.  You took out the car battery and you had that bucket of water.  What?  That wasn't me. 
[01:26:30]  The jumping cables with the wet sponges on them.  The pliers as he's taping his wrists to the table.  What?  What?  Yeah, a little Sariana moment.  I was sticking up for one of our boys, believe it or not, and then it turns out he might have  had something to do with the whole thing, which is wonderful on my, well, whatever.  Someday.  Anyway, the book.  But I'm serious, Bill.  A little respect for your level of psycho.  Right, right.  But I'm serious about that it was a moment. 
[01:27:00]  I love playing into things, but as far as that goes, you've just got to know when it's  a moment and it's time to move on.  That's all.  But I like the contest where we get the cities attacking each other.  I think that could be fun.  That's how you spin it into something else, into something else more positive.  You take what happened to you, now we make it into something else that doesn't involve  you.  So now I say the cities attack each other.  Attack.  Attack.  Through song.  Yeah, I know.  Through a buttery beat. 
[01:27:30]  It's like a musical.  Right.  West Side Story.  Attack each other, but dance and sing.  Right.  Have a knife fight, but make sure you're tapping along.  All right, we should take a break and then we'll get into what Bill Burr's been up to.  We got Mel Gibson audio.  We got Twitchell's audio.  We got the four-year-old that's on the no-fly list.  We got some great stuff today.  Barbra Streisand.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  We'll get into her as well.  Oh, no.  We're not going to badmouth her either.  Oh, my God.  No.  Well, I hope not.  She's an icon. 
[01:28:00]  We'll discuss next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I love showing my introverted fat guys to whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Nice.  For Bill Burr.  Bill likes the drums.  Yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Bill Burr in studio.  Before we move on, Susie, I guess she's from Cleveland.  Susie, what's up?  Hey, Cleveland doesn't suck. 
[01:28:30]  Come on, man.  Well, we got a little war that's starting here, I think.  Jersey versus Cleveland.  Wow, Susie.  That did.  Mistake by the lake.  Okay, so our river caught on fire.  So we lost a football team.  Come on.  Yeah, punching out.  Wow.  I think Dave has started something.  I do believe all the cities are going to start attacking each other now.  We'll see what happens.  I wanted to enjoy more of the voice of that delicate flower.  Yeah.  Wow.  Horrible.  She had great debating skills, huh?  Cleveland doesn't suck. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, come on.  Come on.  That's when you know you've lost.  Oh, they caught on fire.  That's lost the football team.  That's dumb.  Come on.  Hey.  Nice voice.  Low blow.  Low blow.  Well, we got to talk about Coconut Willie in a little bit.  But first, we got to talk about what?  Pimp My Ride?  Yeah.  We started talking about it during break and figured just leave it.  Just leave it for the air.  We're starting to get smart because we'll do a whole break during the commercials and  then we try to recreate it on the air and it's like, oh. 
[01:29:30]  Well, we rarely try to recreate it on the air.  It's so much better during the commercials.  We know it just doesn't work that way.  And it's like scripted or pre-thought out stuff.  So you guys start and then it's like, all right, hold it.  Hold it right there.  Let's just stop right there.  We were kind of talking about cars.  Bill is congratulating me.  I keep asking about, yeah, the Mustang, that son of a bitch.  Much to Jimmy's horror.  The fact that this idiot is doing 110 miles an hour, it just worries me.  Allegedly. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, allegedly.  Someone said, what do you have, a lever that, like fighter planes release chaff to keep a  missile off you?  It's like, do you have a lever that releases PBA cards that just fly out of the back of  your car when a cop gets behind you?  Every time a cop pulls out anywhere near behind me, I just expect to get pulled over now.  I haven't yet.  But even doing the speed limit and everything, I just expect it.  Because my car looks so fast, man.  Because it's the kind of car you would get pulled over in.  That's just it.  Looks selfish.  I have a mortgage payment to make.  We can't afford to have your teeth in a tree. 
[01:30:30]  How about this?  You know, he ties a bandana around his head.  Of course, he plays young rock music.  Bandana!  Born to be one.  Are you?  All right.  He has to listen to Grand Funk Railroad.  We're an American band.  Yeah, man.  I picture more of Tom Cochran, Life is a Highway.  Once my mortgage is paid off.  Oh, he did hit a tree.  Life is a highway. 
[01:31:00]  When I said I was picking the car up, I remember Jimmy saying, you know, what are you going to blare out of the stereo?  A Bon Jovi?  Like some kind of Bon Jovi?  And I'm sitting in the showroom waiting for the paperwork to get done.  And a Bon Jovi song comes on in the showroom.  And I'm cracking up just thinking, you give love to me to get the wind in your head.  A bad name.  No, I don't.  Makes me sick to think.  No, he would listen to that, the cowboy.  I'm a cowboy. 
[01:31:30]  I'm a cowboy.  What it did are a life.  Yeah, this is my life.  I am a cowboy.  I'm a cowboy.  And this is my steel horse, man.  It's a Mustang.  But I'm in it, not on it.  You know, like the song says.  Because it's not a motorcycle.  What is the ultimate driving tune?  Give us a call.  Shut up.  Shut up.  No one cares.  I keep the radio down very low because I have to hear the engine, man. 
[01:32:00]  You're in my car.  You've got to hear it, man.  Freaking Anthony.  Honestly, I think it's awesome.  He was telling me how fast he was going the other day.  And I'm not even thinking about our future together.  I'm just like, eh, cool, man.  Yeah, all I'm thinking about is gig plugs.  How about this?  As soon as I ever make it, I'll hand you a bottle of liquor and you can drive as fast as you want.  And then I'll laugh at my friend as I visit you and I tickle your chin when you can't move below the neck.  Can't do impersonations when you're blowing into a tube. 
[01:32:30]  I probably should be the guy that says, you know what, Ant, you really shouldn't be doing that.  Bob would get mad at you.  Not Bob.  Bob would be psyched.  He's got the life insurance policy on you.  Double indemnity for an accident, he'd probably get loads of cash.  You told me you were doing 110, he goes, faggot.  Yeah, faster, faster.  When we signed our contract at NEW where we were going to get syndicated and we were going to make the big time finally,  they actually sat me down and said, before you sign this,  could you promise that you wouldn't hold on to the back of trucks anymore when you're skating around Manhattan? 
[01:33:00]  Rollerblading, yeah.  Because I would tell the stories on the air.  Yeah, it'd be a great way to go a little faster and get home a little faster and have a little adventure.  And they actually sat me down like, could you please not do that anymore?  Look.  We're investing in you guys now.  Here's all I did.  I try to be an adult when I'm driving.  I really do.  It's on the Meadowbrook Parkway at like one in the afternoon.  There's no one on this thing.  There's really no one on the parkway, the stretch that I was on. 
[01:33:30]  And this jackass comes up next to me with this, I don't know what it was,  one of these cars that the Hispanic people like driving, I think a Toyota Celica.  Stolen.  That's very good.  But, like, and he kept, like, pushing it.  You know, he kept just going, man.  I know, and I don't, look.  How old are you?  I know, exactly.  I don't fall for that.  Was he going, man? 
[01:34:00]  So I'm just, no, he just kept coming up real fast and then pulling a little ahead of me  and then pulling behind me again.  Just being like a douche.  Just, you know something, normally in my friggin' Escalade, I would get away from him.  I just wanted away from him.  I like being around nobody when I'm driving, especially if the road's clear.  I don't like someone next to me.  That's why you have guns.  So, yeah, exactly.  That's why you just pop a few out the window.  So I decided to just pull away from him and I put it to the floor. 
[01:34:30]  And I swear to you, it was just a matter of a few short seconds and it was up to 110 miles an hour.  And he was like, not even an issue anymore as far as being next to me.  Anthony, how dumb were you?  It was, what?  You're just admitting to the entire tri-state area that you're up for the challenge.  Oh, I'm up.  You're up for the challenge.  You see me out there.  Come on.  On that dangerous street called the Meadowbrook Parkway.  The Meadowbrook Parkway. 
[01:35:00]  It's wonderful.  Pink street sign.  Believe me, there's plenty of crosses and roses taped to trees on that road.  Leave your monuments at home, you morbid bastards.  When I was in L.A., on the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica, where they met, there was all these flowers.  Oh, boy.  And somebody had a bicycle that they had spray-painted the whole thing white.  I guess somebody got killed on a bicycle.  Dude, there's one in Brooklyn, too.  On a bicycle.  Oh, my God.  There's one in Brooklyn, a bike. 
[01:35:30]  It's chained to a sign.  It's spray-painted white for a girl who got hit by a truck.  Yeah.  Why don't you just put the corpse out there?  Yeah.  Yeah, at least we can touch it.  Just lay out.  I literally got like...  It was like seeing a ghost.  Yeah, why do we have to be depressed because you lost a loved one?  They're all over the place, those crosses.  Be reminded of your own mortality.  Be reminded that driving is dangerous.  Be reminded that this tree isn't moving.  It's the tree with a big friggin' Tyrannosaurus bite mark taken out of it,  and then a little cross with flowers, and we miss you. 
[01:36:00]  With a baby picture.  Oh, great.  A baby, too.  Wonderful.  It's going to be like a frosted, like, crushed tricycle with a little ball.  Little baby shoes dangling from a branch.  Do we have the exact spot of your death have to mark it?  Yeah.  It's so depressing.  Yeah, you're not John F. Kennedy.  Let's calm down.  You're not JFK.  Right.  Why don't they just spray-paint your cubicle and show what you really accomplished in life?  Maybe you hit the tree on purpose.  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, then at least you could go, all right, I see why he did this.  Yeah, all right.  We just don't need that.  If you do that, you know how many guys in Chelsea would have, like, little crucifixes hanging around their asses?  Oh, wow.  Wow, this got evil real quick.  It certainly did.  Yeah, wow.  We were supposed to be talking about Pimp My Ride.  Yeah, let's do that.  I was talking, saying how, you know, his car looks great.  You know what I mean?  It's got, like, one little stripe on it, you know, just enough.  But, like, Pimp My Ride, they somehow, they jumped the shark, man. 
[01:37:00]  They used to make decent cars, but now they have to, like, top each other.  Yeah, it's people take their piece of crap car, and they win the opportunity to have their ride pimped.  And I remember when the show first came on, it was just, hey, fix it.  I got a piece of crap.  It's rusted.  It's dented.  They put some rims on it.  Yeah, they put some nice rims on it.  They'll tint the windows or something like that.  Whatever it is.  It's just something.  And then take all the dents out and give it a good paint job.  And now they show you, and it's like, oh.  And they ask you what your interests are so they can incorporate some of your interests into the vehicle. 
[01:37:30]  That's what screwed it up.  That's what screwed the whole thing up.  And the new guy, the new Mexican guy, they got spray painting it.  Yeah.  Picks the worst colors.  Like, he'll have, like, the greatest car ever.  It's like a Ferrari.  He goes, oh, I'm going to take some lime green and some lavender.  And I saw that you had an aquarium, so I'm going to put fish scales down the side with some gills.  And they start nodding at the camera.  It's like, why are you going to do that?  What are you doing?  Not only that, though, they would put the actual fish tank in the car, too. 
[01:38:00]  Exactly.  Make it to where you can't even drive the thing anymore.  Yeah, what are you saying?  So we put a chandelier in the backseat because we heard you like Titanic.  You like the movie.  So anytime.  And then we put a DVD player in the headrest.  They ruin these things.  Where the doors don't even open anymore.  Like, they fold out on motors and turn into, like, wings.  Because I hear, you know, you like airplanes.  Oh, really?  And they make the cars Atari for carjacking.  It's like, because most of these cars are in the bad neighborhoods. 
[01:38:30]  And it's the huge sound system they put.  Yeah, now you have to drive around with this thing.  And they all saw it on MTV.  You got a flat tire.  How are you going to get away?  You're going to call the cops.  Yeah, it's got fish scales on it.  Yeah.  And it's hot pink and burnt sienna.  It's got plain wings and 14 Dominicans in it.  You'll see it.  And it's got a basketball hoop, you know, on my hood because I like basketball.  So they decided to give me a hoop.  Yeah, put a hoop on there so you could shoot hoops.  What the heck?  They got a kicker system where there's no spare tire anymore. 
[01:39:00]  The whole trunk is taken up with some kind of sound system that's going to blow the windshield out.  I saw one.  This girl was an artist.  So they got some sort of computer screen that you literally can draw on.  And they put it above her in the car.  That's what you need.  On the driver's side.  Because that's what she's going to do at Red Light.  If she gets, like, inspired.  And I'm sure in case, you know, you get into an accident, everything is real safe.  The shrapnel from 20 flat screen televisions exploding in your face. 
[01:39:30]  20 flat screens and an easel.  Yeah.  We took out the airbag and put in a flat screen.  So if you get in an accident, you get to see the accident happen before the flat screen hits you in the face.  That show stinks now.  Just fix it.  And they're trying to be funny.  Yeah.  And they're not.  Oh, it's awful.  It's really bad.  Well, you got a lot of people that want to race you now in the Meadowbrook.  Yeah.  See what you started?  Mm-hmm.  They're all mad that I'll beat them. 
[01:40:00]  I'll race you on Fanny Pack Lane.  All right.  What do you got?  What do you got, George?  All right.  Listen.  Yeah.  Anthony, you there?  Yeah.  What do you got?  All right.  Listen, man.  I got a 72 Roadrunner.  You bring your go-kart, I'll wait for you on the Meadowbrook.  I'll show you who's boss.  We'll race for pinks.  We'll race for pinks.  We'll race for pinks.  Wait, wait.  What do you got to race for?  What do you got?  I got a 72 Roadrunner.  Oh, stop it.  He's got the real one.  I'm a Mopal, man.  Dude.  I'll eat your car up in a heartbeat. 
[01:40:30]  Just stop it.  You got rims on your go-kart?  What's your quarter time, my friend?  I do nines.  You do what?  Tens?  Tens?  Elevens?  All right.  I do 12, so shut up.  Opie and Jimmy.  You beat me.  Opie and Jimmy.  How much time have you spent under the hood, my friend?  Opie and Jimmy.  Hey, can I be third, Mike?  How much time have you spent under the hood?  Of course you can.  I'll be third, Mike.  I've been going to school for about three years, bro.  Of course. 
[01:41:00]  Take your greasy fingers and go home.  The O.J. virus spreading across America.  O.J.  O.J.?  Oh, nothing.  You keep talking about racing.  No, no.  We're not planning.  This isn't plotting.  This is planning.  Yes, thank you, Jimmy.  Hey, are we going to spray paint his car all white and put like a headset, headphones  hanging off it?  I'm not going to tell you, my friend.  You'll beat me.  They should pimp your eye with Nazi stuff, man.  Nazi memorabilia.  Actually, I have two out of the three colors on that Mexican dude, and I heard that you 
[01:41:30]  don't like me.  Hey, I got a big swastika paint that's right on my hood.  I'll look for you.  All right, let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, they had an episode where they put TV screens in the headlights.  They what?  TV sets in the headlights?  They put me outside to see.  They put TV screens in the headlights?  That makes any sense.  No, it doesn't.  I know.  I'm punching out.  All right, let's go to Dawn.  From Pittsburgh.  Dawn.  Hello?  Hello?  Dawn's a guy? 
[01:42:00]  Dawn.  Is your name Dawn?  Dawn.  D-O-N, yeah.  Dawn.  Wow, that Pittsburgh accent is a bitch.  For you, anyway.  Dawn.  Our androgynous little phone answerer.  I couldn't tell.  What's up, Dawn?  Hey, that whole comment you guys made about those crosses and stuff on the side of the road?  Yeah.  You know what?  I totally agree with you.  If your parents die in your butt, you don't make a monument in there, do you?  Yes.  Then why do it on the side of the road?  I don't get the roadside memorials. 
[01:42:30]  Someone on the instant feedback, I can't find it now.  They're like, and mostly these people really care.  You actually will take the time to maybe look at one of these because you're whatever, I don't know, changing a tire.  You know why you would be on the side of the road.  Limp along on a flat pass, I think.  Right.  Creepy.  And all of a sudden, you see the pictures, and you can barely see the pictures anymore because the sun has taken...  They're all faded.  Yeah, they're all faded.  And this person's like, yeah, you really care enough to, you know, come by every six months and maybe change the picture.  Re-up it. 
[01:43:00]  It's not a cemetery.  Stupid teddy bears with a pink ribbon.  Oh, you just know it was awful.  But it wasn't a kid.  It was just a retarded adult.  You shouldn't have been driving.  All right.  Hey, Danny in Boston.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, I got a cruising song for you.  Yeah?  Highway Star by Deep Purple.  Oh, Highway Star by Deep Purple.  He's from Boston.  Highway Star.  Highway Star.  Highway Star.  Well, call your local home of rock and roll.  That's who would care about that.  That's what I'm jamming.  Best cruising song is of Tempted by the Fruit of Another. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, my God.  That could be the worst one.  You picked the worst one.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Detroit Rock City.  Yes, we get it.  We're not doing this bit, though.  Karen, Edison, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Have you ever seen Trick My Truck on CMT?  I've heard about that.  Is that country?  On country music television?  Of course it is.  Oh, it was Bert from Philly wants to credit on that.  What do they do with the trucks?  What do they do?  Putting nooses in the back of them?  No.  They take people with hardship stories and fix their tractor trailer. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yeah, I think they go literally to trailer trash.  Yeah.  Like, you know, my husband beats me.  Well.  And then I want to drive away from it, but the truck won't start.  And then he beats me with the fender.  That's fantastic.  Who hosts that one?  Is it like Travis Tritt?  It's the Chrome Mafia.  My God.  Ew.  The Chrome Shop Mafia is the name of the people who do it. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, cool.  Way to know when someone's going for a line.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Joelle.  Joelle.  Sometimes you'll ask a question.  Let me explain something to the audience out there.  Yeah.  What Bill is doing and this is what we do.  Yeah, you have a joke you want to say.  And sometimes you'll ask, like, what am I supposed to do?  And then comes the line.  Yeah.  But as he says that, she jumps in with her literal answer.  I mean, what are they going to call it?  Chrome Mafia.  All right.  Well, there goes that moment.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  For ruining that.  Thanks a lot.  Joelle.  Perhaps it's the Chrome Mafia. 
[01:45:00]  That's good, Jimmy.  Joelle.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  What do you got for the show?  Hey.  I just want to defend Jersey.  I know it's been a while since you guys were talking about the Jersey-Cleveland crap.  But from a girl who went to school in Ohio right by Cleveland, it sucks.  Cool.  See, it's starting at.  Wow, Jersey is mocking Cleveland bad.  A city is, a state is fighting a city.  That's not good.  Yeah.  That's not good. 
[01:45:30]  It's not a city.  I'm saying Jersey versus Cleveland.  It's not a city, though.  Cleveland is not a city?  It's a cesspool.  It's got four buildings.  It's got four buildings.  And the rest is all neighborhood.  And that's it.  But you guys rock.  Thanks for being back.  Godspeed.  Thank you.  Bye.  She told them over there in Cleveland.  Stop talking gal like that.  She told them.  Thank God she's on our side.  Craig on Long Island.  Craig.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[01:46:00]  Hey.  I was working over the weekend on Sunday out in the Rockaways.  I'm driving on, who's that, Ocean Shorefront Parkway, whatever the hell it is.  And, you know, looking at the water, girls, and there's one of those bikes.  All spray-painted white.  What?  Into a tree or something.  I'm telling you, the hair on the back of my neck stood up.  I never heard of the bike thing.  The white bike thing.  It was like one of those little girly bikes.  But they spray-painted white because, I guess, the kid's in heaven now? 
[01:46:30]  Completely white.  And then they'll be hours underneath it.  And people in heaven.  I was just like, I don't need to see this.  All right.  It's like heaven's going to be a great place.  Oh, come on.  Oh, sorry.  I want to steal one of those bikes and then just ride it around.  Ride it around that stupid ghost bike.  Oh, that'd be great for Halloween.  Yeah.  Steal one of those bikes.  There's Jimmy riding the all-white bike, and it says, we miss you, Ashley, on the back.  Oh, I'm making just ghost noises. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, driving their house.  Oh, what a creep.  Dude, you should steal one of the bike, and then you dress up as the guy who got run over.  Oh.  No, you just chain your bike to it on the side and then run it to the store.  This memorial now has, like, your kickstand scratching it.  Bicycle rack.  Put a bike rack there.  God, I want to steal that bike.  Put his bike in there.  God, I want to steal that bike so badly and then just ride it.  Going boo.  Just ride it in circles going, ha-ha.  Let's go to Doug out, Doug.  Doug, what do you got?  You guys trampled a great line by Jimmy before when talking about Anthony's Pimp My Ride. 
[01:47:30]  You guys were throwing out Nazi references, and Jimmy just simply said, a really big ashtray.  Thank you.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  Hey, let's go to Samantha in West Palm.  Sometimes you don't want them to remind the people what you've said.  By the way, to West Palm Beach, we're coming.  Oh, is it definite?  It's not definite, but we're going to make a little trip to West Palm Beach because we're  not stupid.  It's getting cold up here, and we're going warm. 
[01:48:00]  Samantha, what's up?  Nothing.  And I was just calling to make a comment about, you know, the roadside memorabilia.  You have a sexy voice.  Thank you.  I think that it's a good thing.  I think that it's a reminder to people who are out there driving, maybe driving drunk,  making stupid decisions, driving fast, that this is what can happen, and it doesn't only  affect those people.  It affects other people.  No, you're wrong.  You're wrong.  No, it doesn't affect the family. 
[01:48:30]  It's creepy.  Once you're dead, you're dead.  The family gets over it.  Thank you.  I would love to know how many crashes were caused because someone was looking at the  roadside memorial going, what the?  Wait, what, Samantha?  What did you ask?  I'm sorry.  I said, well, you really love your family then, don't you?  Because I know if my family member was deceased because of a drunk driver, I don't think I  would be too happy about that.  I don't mind.  But would you build a...  Yeah, would you spray paint something white and make everybody else look at it?  Spray paint a bunch of whiskey bottles and put it there? 
[01:49:00]  You spray paint a bar with laughing patrons.  Well, I've never seen...  Shut up and let us laugh.  We're having a laugh, Sammy.  Hold on a second.  Sammy?  Hold on a second.  Sammy with an eye and a little heart dotting it.  We're having a good chuckle over the drunk driving death thought.  Memorial.  Memorial.  Now, get back to your point.  What were you saying?  I was saying that I think it's a good thing in a way.  What do we know you do?  A little white thing spray painted all over. 
[01:49:30]  Shut up.  I've seen a white bike spray painted, so I mean, I don't...  I can't say...  But yet you're commenting.  But yet you...  Good point, Bill.  Good point.  All right.  Who'd you lose in your family, Samantha?  Huh?  Who got hit?  Who'd you lose?  I did, but I've lost six friends in drunk driving accidents.  That's a lot of spray accidents.  Jesus.  Yeah, in a three-year period of time, and...  Were they the drunk ones?  In one case, the three of them were driving, and the one kid was drunk, but in the other  case, it was a drunk driver who hit my friend's car and flipped them, and all three of them 
[01:50:00]  died.  Yeah.  So you've got three families that lost a member of their family because of somebody  else's irresponsibility.  Does anybody remember laughter?  Well, you know what?  Does anybody remember laughter?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  On the side of the road.  What?  I just don't think that there's anything wrong with putting a cross up on the side of the  road.  I know you don't, but you know what, Sammy Kings, let me take lemons and make lemonade  here.  I mean, I know it's really sad for the families and stuff like that, but that extra money  at Christmas can be put towards other things.  Right. 
[01:50:30]  Just because they're deceased doesn't mean that they were never your family.  Oh, I was kidding.  You still have to have the same respect.  Oh, my God.  Way to just bum out everybody.  You want to take your funny bone and spray paint it white and put it somewhere.  God almighty, you're a humorless hole.  Shut up.  I think we're going to reconsider our trip to West Palm.  Oh, my God.  What a curmudgeon.  How long have you been listening to the show?  I think she's not very long because some of the points that you guys make are... 
[01:51:00]  How old the point are you?  This is what I'm going to tell you.  I don't think the show's for you.  Got to tell you.  We don't need every listener out there.  If we keep her on the phone any longer, we're going to have to spray paint the show white.  Yeah, so what you've got to do is, listen, we understand you've had some bereavement.  So why don't you, if you miss your friends so much, why don't you grab a bottle, drive real fast.  You'll see them soon enough.  Call me with that self-righteous dreck.  Shut up.  They're saying certain states want to ban roadside memorials.  Good.  I say good as well. 
[01:51:30]  Absolutely.  And funerals.  And everything.  Once you're dead, they put you in a big fire and you're not even allowed to cry.  Yeah, they just toss you in a wood chipper.  They just throw you in a wood chipper.  All right, listen, when we get back, we got Coconut Willie.  We got Mel Gibson audio.  We got four.  We got to get to some of this stuff for once.  Samantha stinks.  These guys work so hard behind the scenes, we never play their stuff.  We got the four-year-old that's on the no-fly list.  Oh.  We got Barbra Streisand cursing someone out at Madison Square Garden. 
[01:52:00]  F her.  Mel Gibson talking about his drunk driving thing.  And we got to talk about Coconut Willie.  And we got to give you an update on the midget we saw outside XM.  the other day.  The little one that Eric took the photo of.  Yeah, getting into it.  Yeah, but it turns out he's a, should I say now or wait?  Yeah.  He's an opera midget.  Singer.  That's right.  Hey, that's a good contest.  Somebody can spray paint a midget white.  No, well, no, you don't spray paint him.  You spray paint his mother's crotch.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  Ah, newscaster doing yoga.  Always funny.  Ah, terrific.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we got opera midgets.  Back behind your desk.  Doing what he does best.  Mitt being short?  No.  Making people laugh.  He's singing his opera.  We got a little taste.  The picture's up on opianthony.com as well as the picture of Scarlett Johansson that's  in the paper today.  I've heard his opera, by the way.  Yeah?  Totally do. 
[01:53:00]  Totally do.  Totally do.  Totally do.  He frolics in the flowers.  Every time he moves his little flipper arms, magic dust comes off him.  Oh, he spreads magic dust.  It's the ONA virus.  Before we go to break, Bill, promoting anything today?  You think I would, right?  Nothing, huh?  I got nothing.  I am.  What do I got?  Comics Come Home?  Yes, yeah.  Comics Come Home October 28th in Boston at that place where the BU Terriers play. 
[01:53:30]  Are we invited?  Huh?  I haven't been invited to one of those in a while.  Comics Come Home in Boston.  Yeah, well, there's a reason for that.  You thought I was Anthony.  Once called me Anthony.  Sorry.  Yes.  Once called you Anthony.  Yeah, now you're all confused.  I blew that line.  You know where you are?  I forget where I was.  How come I didn't get a sound effect?  Jesus.  All right.  By the way, old.  Since you're being shunned and shirked in Boston, November 10th, you're  invited to the Hammerstein Ballroom.  Oh.  He's going to be there.  It's, uh...  Jimmy, Jimmy, doing jokes. 
[01:54:00]  It's a thing we call the virus.  We'll be back.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  That's 866-313-FREE.  The phone lines are going berserk.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bill Burr in studio today.  This show is moving today.  I think we're going to have to do, like, a speed round to get a few other things on  the radio.  I want to hear that strisand thing. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's go to Tracy on Long Island.  Tracy.  Hey, guys.  How's it going, man?  Love your show.  Love your show.  Thanks, Tracy.  I drive for a living, so I listen to you guys every morning.  Cool.  I want to let you guys know that here on Long Island, you guys are no longer the ONA virus.  You've become the ONA plague.  Plague?  The plague.  The plague.  Everybody knows you as the plague.  The plague.  Awesome.  I'll see for myself.  I'm going to the Islanders' home opener.  Homo?  Against your Bruins, by the way, Bill.  Hey, Islanders doing great. 
[01:55:00]  Did they win last night?  They played at one in the morning.  They lost.  They lost again last night?  0-3.  Oh, crap.  And I just got the season tickets again.  Half season.  I don't want to commit to this team.  When are you going to that game?  Saturday.  Oh, it's Saturday.  The home opener, yeah, against your Bruins.  So, I got to take you to a game.  I got to take my little nephew, so you're out this time.  But next time they play the Bruins, I'll give you a call, Bill.  Why don't you bring Bill as your nephew?  Have him dress up in, like, the Angus Young shorts and a little bit of knickers.  Have him in knickers. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  I'll wait until the last minute to get the tickets, because I just can't commit to this team.  Well, I mean, the Bruins...  Our ex-backup goalie's now the GM.  I mean...  I went to a Bruins game last year after they traded Joe Thornton.  It's like we had nobody.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  So, I don't know.  They got some new guy in there.  I'm kind of paying attention to it, so I'm hoping they're going to turn it around.  And my nephew's getting to the age where he's going to start realizing that the team just sucks.  He's like an uber fan.  Yeah.  And I just take him to the games knowing, like, they're going nowhere, and he's got that hope. 
[01:56:00]  He's got the hope.  But he's getting at that age where he's...  Drive for five.  Where he's starting to understand, like, wow, our team's not that good, is it?  We'll see, though.  You want to go Opera?  You want to go Coconut Willie?  You want to go Barbra Streisand?  You want to go Mel Gibson?  We've got to tie up to Midget.  I want to hear a little Opera, because Jimmy just put the Midget's picture up on Paltalk.  You want to explain?  Set this up, Jimmy, please.  Well, Eric was doing something, and he saw a little Midget trying... 
[01:56:30]  News is...  That was news enough.  What?  Eric was doing something.  Yeah, see, Eric was doing something, but it wasn't something we needed done.  He was out front doing something on the sidewalk, and I wish I had something funny, but I didn't,  so I'll just keep going with the story.  And he saw a little Midget trying to close a cab door, but the little Midget couldn't  do it because the little fella had flipper hands.  Gold.  And Eric took what, to me, is the greatest photo take in the last 20 years, which is...  The beautiful thing is, it's a Midget wearing high-water pants.  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  How does a Midget wear floods?  Pants that are too short.  How do you...  How does a Midget find floods?  He's like mini William Frawley.  And he has a bunt and an awful head, and he's closing the cab...  It looks like he's telling the cab a joke and elbowing it.  Man, did you get it?  Did you get it?  Mother drank during pregnancy.  Did you get it?  He's like Big A, only little.  He is absolutely, like, lowercase.  Yeah, he's a mini A.  I think the bunts, what's making his pants short.  He's got to pull it up over it.  That's either a bunt or he's a lucky man, even for having no hands. 
[01:57:30]  No, it's bunt.  Yeah.  He tapers from the bottom up.  He's just horrifying.  He has normal-sized person feet, and it looks like he's frolicking.  It looks like that.  I wanted him photoshopped in a field of lilies and magic.  I think someone did that, too.  Yeah, they did.  And we were joking, saying that the music he hears, like, when you see him, all you should  hear is, totally-do, totally-dee.  Like, that should be the music that the little nothing is making. 
[01:58:00]  The picture's up on opianthony.com, so here's the update.  I'll be damned if Hawk didn't come with the information.  This guy is, his name is Thomas, I would ever, is recognized as one of the most remarkable  singers of his generation.  Really?  Of his D-generation.  Oh.  He is an opera singer.  Yeah.  And there's a photo, I'll hold up the pal talk again, of him.  Just tell me if that's on target, my sweet.  Standing on his seat.  Yeah, down a little. 
[01:58:30]  There you go.  It's a picture of him standing in front of sheet music with those worthless appendages we  would call arms and hands, to him they're just laughable things hanging, and he's singing,  he's belting out a tune.  And here's the song.  No way.  That's coming out of a midget.  He's like this singing frog in Bugs Bunny.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey. 
[01:59:00]  It's a beautiful Italian song.  It's a song called Why, God, Why?  Hey, hey, hey.  No.  No way.  Yeah.  Wow.  No handicap parking. 
[01:59:30]  Always after me, lucky charm.  Damn the top shelf.  Wow.  Do you want to get more or what?  That was nice and mean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a cloudy day today.  He's got a hell of a talent.  It'll be all right, though.  Guy's got a good talent.  Oh, that was lovely.  But he should be in an opera.  He should sing, and then he should be forced to put on an elf outfit, like a little green, 
[02:00:00]  like a velour elf jacket, and traipse around the stage until everyone's happy and laughing.  Do you think anybody in the orchestra, you ever caught him laughing like somebody playing  the French horn just goes like, look at him.  Look at him.  Well, you get the idea, unless you want to hear more opera from the midget.  I don't know.  He sings.  He's got a movie star head, though.  Look at that.  I wish I knew opera jokes.  Yeah.  I don't know any.  We don't know any operas.  Aria.  It's a crossword puzzle word. 
[02:00:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well.  All flipper hands.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Or a little fella.  Well, there you go.  Life is a doggie paddle.  I want to see when he finishes a song, and he goes.  Yeah, because usually you do the ta-da with your arms.  Right.  Yeah.  Put them out.  You're so good at explaining my visual jokes on the radio.  It's a ta-da.  He would conduct the orchestra, but he'd poke both his eyes out.  With little flipper hands.  Holding that stick.  It would look like a yardstick.  You just used a toothpick.  It would just go really fast.  Slow down. 
[02:01:30]  I can't help it.  My arm's too short.  No, he conducts it with an uncooked piece of spaghetti.  Speed round.  Speed round.  Oh.  Okay.  Here we go.  We're in speed round.  I'd grab his fat arm and then just bite it.  I want to grab the, like, bite the fat little forearm part.  That part?  Yeah.  He's sticking out right above the wrist.  The elbow-less arm.  Oh, he's just awful.  Speed round.  Taxi?  How did he hail that cab?  I don't know.  Eh, he's going to put his head up and nod.  Me, me.  Impossible.  Here's a cute little story. 
[02:02:00]  Sam Brady Adams.  He's a four-year-old from Claremont who loves fire engines.  Cute as a butt in this kid.  The Transportation Security Administration associates his name with a potential terrorist.  The name Sam Adams is on the no-fly list along with 44,000 others.  Unfortunately for the four-year-old toddler, it means he's treated like a terrorist.  No, he's not.  Yeah, that really just seemed like a sensational story.  He should be. 
[02:02:30]  Terrorist.  It's difficult, especially traveling at the holidays, because all the flights are completely full.  We get to the airport early because we know this problem is going to be there, but it seems like no matter how early we get there, we're just, we can't, we aren't guaranteed a seat.  According to the director of the Terrorist Screening Center, it's a regrettable inconvenience for those with these names to have to go through heavy screening at the airport.  But it's the price people have to pay to protect national security.  The Sam Adams and Robert Johnsons of this world, though, feel there's got to be a better system.  They ought to come up with a system where if your name is on the list and you can prove that you are not the terrorist, 
[02:03:00]  that you can either get some kind of ID or have some sort of system set up so that you can be placed on a list that says,  yes, my name is Sam Adams, but I'm not the Sam Adams the Terrorist.  It's a popular name, too.  There's a Sam Adams the Terrorist?  It's got to be what, IRA?  Yeah, it's going to say.  Is it?  Probably.  It's not like, I am Sam Adams.  My friend.  Sam O. Adams.  Sam Adams?  Isn't his name on, like, the Constitution? 
[02:03:30]  He was like a lineman for the Patriots in the, like, 70s.  He was, right?  Yeah.  Was it Sam Adams?  A beer.  Julius Adams.  You would know.  Budweiser.  Miller Lite.  Betsy Michigan, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, guys.  I'm a huge fan.  And the only reason I'm calling is just to let Bill Burr know that I am a huge fan.  And I was in Cleveland, and I just feel really bad about what happened.  So I'm so glad to hear you on the air today. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, no, it's all good.  We addressed that earlier.  But thank you, Betsy.  Yep.  You guys have a great day.  Bye.  Take care.  Sexy name.  Go Tigers.  Betsy.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Me, you, Betsy.  Betsy.  Awful.  Why don't you knit yourself a flag?  Betsy.  Oh, boy.  See, here's the problem.  Icon.  Icon.  Connecticut.  What's your name?  Icon.  Nothing?  Whatever.  Dude who wants to defend Ohio.  Yeah, we got a little problem.  New Jersey's taking on Cleveland, actually, so. 
[02:04:30]  I give it to Jersey in three.  Yeah?  Three rounds.  Three rounds?  Knockout.  Best three out of five.  They're going to go three straight.  Aw, yeah.  Sweep them.  All right.  Now they're going to sweep them.  Here we go.  Mel Gibson.  Stupid.  This is a GMA preview.  Good morning, America.  You got the exclusive interview with Mel Gibson.  We thought we would have it, but.  Yeah, we were supposed to.  I guess we came in second place.  Where is it?  We're going to play it quickly.  What did you think it was? 
[02:05:00]  Me?  It was just the stupid ramblings of a drunkard.  And what I need to do to heal myself and to be assuring and allay the fears of others.  And to heal them if they had any heart wounds from something on their own.  Shut up!  So, this is the last thing I want to be is that kind of monster.  This is as far as like waking up in the morning going, did I say that?  What did I do?  The biggest.  What did I say? 
[02:05:30]  There's just no comeback.  No.  No.  Just go full bore the other way.  You know when they were saying.  Yeah.  The Jews.  Any press is, you know, good press.  Not this one.  This is like the most difficult.  You can get busted with the sex tape.  You can get called the hooker.  You can beat your wife and you can somehow come back, you know, and do a remake of the Shaggy  DA.  You can get back in there, right?  Doesn't matter.  But this guy, man.  Done.  I'm going to spin this, though. 
[02:06:00]  I'm going to tell Mel that I was hurt and I need to be healed with a movie roll.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  You're not Jewish, though.  Yes.  Lethal 11-5.  It's him in a yarmulke.  I don't know what that means.  He's trying to.  He's going to have to save somebody Jewish in every movie.  Yeah.  You're going to have to save Israel from a bombing.  Come with me, Mr. Bernstein.  Yeah.  But I am just sitting.  I'm essential to the...  Get on my back.  I'll carry you.  Let's say hi to Nate in Queens.  He's not heavy. 
[02:06:30]  He runs Hollywood.  Nate.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  What's shaking?  What's up?  I was just wondering if Oprah was still looking for a job for the day.  What do you got?  I'm a dog walker.  I own a business in Walking Dogs on the Upper East Side of Manhattan for...  Celebrities, everybody.  Well, this has taken on a life of its own.  MSNBC called.  They want me to work for the Scarborough Report.  What is it called?  Scarborough Country.  Scarborough Country.  What is it called?  Scarborough Country.  Yeah.  They want me to work at MSNBC for the day. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  Well...  It's taken on a life of its own.  Like an intern.  Well, I've only done radio my whole life since I was 18.  And I was a caddy.  And I've been working in radio since 18.  And I worked in a video store.  And I also washed dishes during college.  That's all I've done with my life.  And I'm getting to the point in my life where I'm thinking, I want to see if I'm good at  something else.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, Walking Dogs is something that you can excel at.  But it's also...  It's fun.  You know?  It's outside.  You're on the park.  I think I'm going to start with MSNBC.  And then maybe, you know, tell everybody that I'm looking for another job. 
[02:07:30]  And then we'll see where it goes from there.  All right.  But they're going to have me do all sorts of dumb stuff around there for the day.  You make dog walking sound great until you realize you've got to pick up after 15 dogs.  Yeah.  No more than that.  More than that.  I mean, you know, that's why he said dirty jobs meets jackass.  So I thought, you know, there you go.  What's your technique, dude?  What's your technique?  I've seen a lot out there.  Plastic baggies, newspapers.  I like using recycled newspapers.  That way I don't feel like I'm, you know, abandoning the environment while I'm doing it.  One of his hands is forever a little bit warmer than the other. 
[02:08:00]  Shake his hand.  When you're out there in the freezing cold, you just hold on to those things for a little while, you know.  What's your favorite dog to walk?  Probably my pit bulls.  I have my own dogs.  Oh, boy.  Hey, which breed makes the biggest mess?  Probably a Bernice Mountain Dog.  That just sounds like it'd have a Bernice.  A Bernice.  Full of pine cones and leaves.  A hand, a little kid, or boy. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, what a ghoul.  Do you actually talk to them as you put them in the baggie?  Yeah, I actually, you know, examine them a little to make sure they haven't eaten any foreign material  or that, you know, that their health is in good shape, that they don't have any bugs or worms or, you know, whatever, you know.  Do you have any idea how many levels you're awful on?  Yeah.  What did you want to be when you were growing up, Nate?  Actually, I went to vet school for a while, and then it, you know.  Yeah, it went horribly wrong.  Have you ever artificially inseminated an animal?  Ugh.  Actually, you know, it's funny, but, you know, I've assisted in that before, sure. 
[02:09:00]  Did you spread the ass cheeks?  Ugh.  You know, with horses, you do kind of have to get in there and vaseline them up.  I have a degree in animal husbandry, so I've worked with a lot of different animals before.  But, yeah, yeah, you know, you've got to get them lubed up.  All right.  Thank you, Nate.  Yeah, we'll see where this job thing goes with.  It started off as us just kind of talking about, I don't know, it was one of our dumb tangents,  and now it's taking on a life of its own, so it's kind of like Dirty Jobs meets Jackass.  I want to try some things out. 
[02:09:30]  But unusual jobs, mostly.  Not necessarily Dirty, or we'll, you know, I'll try Dirty Jobs or two.  All right, Barbra Streisand, let's end with this today.  Tells Heckler to shut the F up.  She got a little pissed off, yeah.  Well, she did a skit instead of singing her songs.  Sing your dopey songs.  She took out, she brought out the George Bush impersonator, whose time is running out, by the way.  I would love to see what he does next.  Yeah.  And they did a little skit, and obviously someone in the crowd didn't like it, so he voiced his opinion, 
[02:10:00]  and she got offended that someone didn't like something she was doing.  She just wants to be poignant.  Do what you do, you toucan Sam, hook knows nothing.  Sing your dumb songs and beat it.  That's what you do.  That's what people paid for.  Of course they did.  Pay for her comedy.  Hawk Fruit Loops and sing a song.  I like a little variety of my shows.  Do you?  Little skits, little plate spinning.  Exactly.  Mike Douglas dropped that already.  Here are two people who tend not to share anything, let alone a stage. 
[02:10:30]  I am your biggest fan.  Actually, the real President Bush would probably rather hang out with the Dixie Chicks than  Barbara Streisand, a liberal diva.  Hey, look at me.  Hey, it's not how you look, it's what you said that had tongues wagging.  I heard that Streisand let him have it.  She sure did.  It happened at a star-studded live concert Streisand gave at Madison Square Garden.  There's Oprah. 
[02:11:00]  There's Rosie.  There's Tony Bennett.  There's George Bush impersonator Steve Bridges.  Happy days.  Are you here?  Are you here?  It was sometime during that routine that a heckler shouted out.  Now, we don't have any footage of the actual incident.  Then why are we listening to you?  The heckler was telling things like, I didn't come to a political fundraiser.  Shut up and sing.  Which made Oprah's comments before the show seem clairvoyant. 
[02:11:30]  I think it's going to be an experience because that is the voice.  Is it?  Wow, that's clairvoyant.  She's a good singer.  She's an overrated hag.  You're an overrated hag, Babs.  Are you talking to Babs personally right now?  Yes, I am.  She listens.  Yeah, we know.  Yep, yep.  In the shower probably, right?  Oh, she bugs me.  One of those waterproof radios.  We get it, you're a liberal, we know.  And what did the voice say in response to the heckler?  Shut the f*** up. 
[02:12:00]  Shut up if you can't take a joke, Streisand said to wild applause.  Even though the jokes were somewhat lame.  Can you believe it for a second?  We were in harmony.  Before the concert ended, Streisand apologized for her F-word outburst.  She told the audience the artist's role is to disturb.  By the way, Streisand got babblicious rave reviews on her performance, except for the  Bush spoof.  You okay?  A horse pen.  You're so good you could give up your day job. 
[02:12:30]  Talk about an impeachable offense.  Wow.  Ginny Moe, CNN.  What a non-story.  Talk about an impeachable offense.  What a non-story.  It really is.  And the fact that she's saying it's the artist's job to offend, well, sorry if you can't do it  through your songs.  Why don't you stop singing fluff-like memories and write something poignant, you douche.  I'd like to bite her nose.  Oh.  She's on the cutting edge.  But you're already full from midget arm.  I am. 
[02:13:00]  I'm finished, you're right.  Hey, we gotta go.  By the way, thank you for flashing me on Pal Talk.  I'm in love.  There's a topless girl on Pal Talk and she looks lovely.  Dr. Dimebag.  Oh, she's wonderful.  She just took her shirt off and she's been sitting there topless the whole time.  I just want to hold her chin and say tender things.  And then, uh, don't say it.  Oh my god, we didn't talk about, uh, uh, your embarrassing-  Coconut.  Oh, coconut willy?  Oh, my embarrassing incident last night.  Yeah, it was kind of a fun.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll do that over at XM. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, I don't know.  I'm scared.  My brother's here.  Brother Alamo's got a plug, right?  Really fast?  Oh yeah, last pest standing.  Saturday, FH Riley's in Huntington.  Pests that you may love and may hate are doing a little stand-up.  A little open mic kind of thing.  Yeah, we're going to rock FH Riley's, I guess, what, Saturday night?  Saturday night.  Start between 9, 10, something like that.  My brother's restaurant, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  I'll be there after the Islander game.  Maybe we can talk Anthony and I think Jimmy will be busy. 
[02:14:00]  I'll be in Cuba.  You're going to Cuba?  Yeah, I go to Guantanamo Bay.  I leave Friday.  I'm back Monday.  Talking about Cuba.  Eating some food.  Are you doing the show Friday?  Yes.  Oh, very cool.  I don't want to talk about that.  Oh, you're not here Monday?  No, it's the military's flying us back.  All right, we'll figure it all out.  Hey guys, if you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  We had a lot of fun today.  Thank you for the support.  Bill Burr, thank you.  I can walk on my hands. 
[02:14:30]  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during 
[02:15:00]  the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM Walkover begins now.  We're outside Free FM on this fine whip-em-out Wednesday.  We've got a nice crowd once again today.  Some new faces, some old faces.  We have a very lovely girl from Italy.  She's from Italy. 
[02:15:30]  Italy.  And she seems like she might be a little slow.  No.  Hi.  What are you doing here?  I'm doing an internship.  I buy red shoes.  It's a chamber of commerce.  It's very serious.  Very serious.  Chamber of commerce.  Internship.  I study in Milan.  I study in Milan.  Oh.  Do you have a...  Are you married?  Me?  No.  Please.  How old are you?  I'm very young.  22.  Oh.  I might have met you 10 years ago. 
[02:16:00]  I'm turning...  I'm turning...  You?  But I'm turning 23 this Saturday.  This...  23?  Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, Saturday.  What do you want for your birthday?  I have a virus for you.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Try to suggest me something.  A load?  A load?  What is a load?  It's like a nice meal.  A load.  Okay.  Why don't you give me a loan?  Like a loan?  A loan?  If you only knew who you were talking to, that can be... 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  No, not get her a loan.  She's like, I'm in a mess.  Everybody becomes a star.  Nice to meet you.  Are you leaving?  No, no.  Me.  I can stay.  I'm thinking a loan for a load would be very nice, so...  I need a girlfriend.  It's like the Moors were in her part of the country.  You need a girlfriend?  Yeah.  A girlfriend from Europe?  The Moors.  A girlfriend in general or a girlfriend from Europe?  A girlfriend from Italy?  And anyone.  Any girlfriend.  They talk with their hands and they also throw stuff when they get mad.  No, but what about you?  I mean, I have someone. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, all right.  Well, good luck in the States.  Yeah.  Okay.  But it's not cheating if you're not in Italy.  That's true.  Yeah.  It's a rule that we have in America.  No cheating.  Although he'll come over for a vendetta.  He's got some of that cash.  Okay.  Cash.  Okay.  So, I mean, this cash for what?  Give me?  It's called a dignity purchase.  Ah, okay.  Okay.  No, but I'm not cheating my boyfriend.  I'm not cheating. 
[02:17:30]  No.  He likes sticking girls in the pooper.  Where does your boyfriend live?  My boyfriend.  My boyfriend is in Sicily right now.  Ah.  Hiding out because he killed McCluskey.  Okay.  So, I really have to go.  Oh, yeah.  Nice meeting you.  Okay.  She's a nice girl.  All right.  Nice to meet you.  Do you want his email address there?  Your email address?  No, because I was going to go out there two weeks ago, but I was like, no, I shouldn't. 
[02:18:00]  And then, like, who knows what happened with them.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  No comment.  Okay.  It's Jim Norton at JimNorton.com.  Jim Norton.  Impossible.  That's all right.  Jim Norton at JimNorton.com.  All right.  All right.  Ciao.  Ciao.  All right.  Ciao.  Ciao.  Nice.  There she goes.  You couldn't even mean to her.  She was sweet.  She's all young.  Before you know it, she's going to be a big fat mamadale.  Yeah.  Hey, look at the guy with the Steve.  That widow.  Huh? 
[02:18:30]  Martini Steve shirt.  Where is it?  Yeah.  It's like Martini Steve riding a Segway.  We got a Segway out here today.  That's how Steve can ride into a cock.  Let's go, Mets.  Got a lot of Mets caps out here today.  A couple, anyway.  A few, whatever.  Hey, Anthony, what happened to the Yankees, man?  I was out of the country.  Are they still in it?  I think they were out of the country, too, to tell you the truth.  They played like they might as well have been.  No, I can't talk trash this year because the Red Sox, they just shit the bed.  You know, it was so much easier, I said, to watch the Yankees totally self-destruct this season 
[02:19:00]  because the Red Sox really gave us, I was able to watch the game, and it didn't bother me like it used to  because they self-destructed so badly with Boston that now it's like,  Ah, so what?  Who cares?  I missed your point.  That I can watch the game without...  Because the Sox weren't in it?  I could watch the Yankees totally blow it now, and I'm fine with it.  He means after the Yankees lost four straight to Boston a couple years ago,  nothing will hurt that fan.  Oh, really?  Now I watch them lose to Detroit, and I'm like, I don't care. 
[02:19:30]  Why would I care?  It's like your wife burning your dinner after you're quite a few guys.  Yeah, the whole thing kind of died because once we won it, I'm like,  all right, just as long as you guys don't win it.  Right.  Who cares?  My favorite shot of the year is when the Yankees got two outs in the bottom of the ninth,  they're going to lose another playoff series, and they do that pan down the dugout,  and it's just one superstar.  A-Rod, Jeter, George Clooney.  It's just like, how do these guys lose?  George Clooney.  Robert Redford with his Wonderboy bat. 
[02:20:00]  They got everybody.  George Steinbrenner should fire himself.  And they lose.  They should have lost.  That fucking Jarrett Wright, that guy's pitching a game for us, sucks.  How can you?  I can't root for guys I hated.  Yeah, Jarrett Wright.  He's a douchebag.  He's a Cleveland Indian.  He's a fuck.  What are you trying to say, Jim?  I don't really care.  I think he likes the guy.  I think he didn't have a good game.  I hate him.  I want him to lose.  Good for the Tigers.  Remember when we used to walk incognito?  Every day it's becoming an event now. 
[02:20:30]  Now it's some kind of event.  Bam is in front of us wearing the shortest jacket I've ever seen on a human being.  Wow.  He can't see.  He sees belt under his jacket.  Wow.  It says Columbia on it.  Was that a cover for the shuttle?  Sorry.  Did you go to Columbia?  No.  All right.  I said no.  Nothing like a pair of dockers and some brown loafers to get the ladies to come run in  little Cliff Clavin white socks.  That's what I tried.  Hey, Mel Karmazin.  How you doing? 
[02:21:00]  Hi, Mel.  Hey, Mel.  No, it wasn't?  No.  Kid's reading.  Oh, my God.  What fucked up is that?  I know.  I hate that.  That kid's like two and he's reading.  It is fucked up.  Hopefully he's making spelling errors.  Jesus.  I just caught that.  Pumping into me.  Hello, businessman.  I didn't mean to, actually.  Inconspicuous businessman.  Jason Steinberg is losing his mind, by the way.  With that fucking long hair.  What is he doing?  Who?  Walking with like a cup holder full of beverages.  I don't know what he's doing. 
[02:21:30]  It's cold out here today.  Oh, ridiculous.  Yeah, look at Dane on the side of a bus.  Play at the mall.  Yeah?  All right.  No, not yet.  It's blinking.  We'll go this way.  Let's go this way today.  Mind your business.  Careful.  Yes, there we go.  Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. 
[02:22:00]  Wow.  They weren't even nice either, but they weren't bouncing.  I believe you were following the bouncing boobies.  There are a lot of ugly people out today.  Oh, it's awful.  It's just an ugly, overcast day.  Ugly day in New York.  It is nasty.  Then again, I'm not helping things.  That's right.  Sorry.  How you doing, miss?  What are you doing to stay warm?  Wearing a sweater.  All right.  That was good.  Yeah.  Ask the question.  You got an answer.  You know, I think upstairs in the studio, there was a crackle. 
[02:22:30]  There was a spark to the show.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We came out here.  No, it got blown out.  The public is off today.  It's all right.  Look at that guy's green, four-screen bag.  We've had some great walkovers lately.  The other day, we were out here for 45 minutes.  Yep.  Today, three.  Yeah, you're lucky.  Look at the chick in the jean skirt.  This is just a drab, awful day in New York.  It's not a flash of color out here.  No.  You know what I watched on YouTube the other day?  We filmed it right in front of that phone booth. 
[02:23:00]  The guy trying to make a phone call using a phone booth, and we're just like, la, la, la.  We were being really loud because no one should use a phone booth in this day and age.  That guy was so annoyed.  You know what's funny is you never really noticed how unsanitary that was until you had a cell phone where the battery died, and you had to drop that quarter in.  You're just like, ugh, 35 cents, whatever it is nowadays.  Earwax.  You got to pluck out with a toothpick.  Anything new on the board today?  Nah.  It's all the same shit. 
[02:23:30]  All I care about is my Hammerstein ballroom poster.  Yeah, Jimmy's up there.  Yeah, Jimmy's got a nice poster up there.  Jimmy, when's the show again?  November the 10th, oh, thanks for asking.  Hammerstein.  Yeah.  Part of the comedy festival.  We're all going.  Good for us.  And Jim, Noah, and?  No acknowledgement today.  Say, what is that?  Nah, we'll get right in.  What goes on in this piano store right here?  They play pianos.  I haven't seen one sold.  Oh, stop.  Sorry about that.  It's actually a complete accident in the 920. 
[02:24:00]  It wasn't?  Twice in a row.  You know?  Sorry.  Oh, look at the guy finally behind the desk.  Yeah, yeah, there's a guy back there.  Look at this guy.  The two-armed mustache.  Yeah.  Said his ego, wait, you get in the elevator.  The guy that runs the door.  Thank you, sir.  How are you, buddy?  Stay upstairs, everybody.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe. 
[02:24:30]  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM. 
[02:25:00]  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, you need a new in-between jacket, Bill Burr. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, wait.  What happened?  Oh, okay.  The in-between jacket can't be swayed.  It's already rained on this, like, 90 times.  Did we do Mistress Karen yesterday? 
[02:26:30]  We didn't do her audio, right?  And do we have the Troggs tapes?  Or the Throgs, whatever the hell.  We got some good stuff to do today.  We got the Mr. T.  We got more Tara.  I actually want to watch that Mr. T show.  My girl's just going, like, this is such a stupid show, and it's just for guys.  It's stupid.  You think it's going to be good?  No.  But I...  I mean, so bad that it's good? 
[02:27:00]  There's so many...  I pity the fool, and there's so many fools that need to be pitied.  Yeah.  It just sounded like wrestling to me.  It's kind of like The Rock.  Can you imagine being known for that?  The smell of The Rock is cooking.  I don't want my blueberries.  Yeah, and his hair's kind of thinning, so the mohawk's a little bit thinner in the back.  Right.  It's just...  Well...  I don't know.  How old is he by now, Mr. T?  He's got to be in his 50s.  He has to.  He's looking good for 50s.  He looks good, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's...  We're getting everyone situated here.  Let's say hi to John in Brooklyn.  John? 
[02:27:30]  How you doing, bro?  What's up?  Hey, Albie.  Hey.  Yeah, can I talk to your brother?  Uh-oh.  What did he do?  What happened?  He didn't do nothing, man.  All right.  What's up?  I love your brother, man.  He's right here.  Which one, man?  He has four brothers.  Yeah.  Elmo.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  I just wanted to ask you about the new Halloween shirt.  Yeah.  I can't get that shirt for nothing.  What do you mean you can't get it for nothing?  It's sold out, and I got all your shirts, and I can't get that one.  One sit for nothing.  They haven't even been printed up yet. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, but it says sold out.  On what?  Ziggy's site?  On Ziggy's site?  Yeah.  Part of the marketing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, we got to add some sizzle to this.  It's a hot item.  What can I tell you?  I love your shirts.  I got every one of them.  Awesome.  Go to Ziggy's site and shoot him an email.  We haven't even gotten them back from the printer yet.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I've seen it sold out.  I figured, oh, man.  I turned it on.  I said, oh, man.  That could just be the default setting because he doesn't have them yet, but I thought he 
[02:28:30]  was going to do pre-orders or something like that.  Check out Brother Elmo on MySpace.  At the worst, he gets a few extras sent to his home, and he'll send you one.  I'm just saying.  I met him on the PFC.  I never met him before.  Oh, you're the dude you said.  You have all the shirts, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  They said I'm modeling for you and everything.  Yep.  All right.  Cool.  Oh, my God.  I remember this.  All right, John.  Remember me.  All right, man.  Thank you, John.  Yeah, don't worry about that.  You'll get a shirt.  All right, man.  All right.  Okay, man.  Go to MyRadioStore.com for T-shirts. 
[02:29:00]  Support the Elmo cause.  Mr. T is 54 years old.  We were trying to figure that out.  Steve and Jersey, what's up?  Hey, boys.  You were just blurting out random celebrity ages.  It's like Rain Man.  Yeah, definitely 54.  Oh, yeah.  You were in the bathroom.  I know.  I'm always the first one in here every day.  It's like, ah, Mr. T is 54.  What the fuck did I miss?  Hey, has this bat been in anybody? 
[02:29:30]  No.  Oh, wow.  Because I started to pick it up.  You're the flipper midget.  Yeah.  That's how he hits those notes.  Actually, that one was in Marilyn Monroe.  Oh, nothing.  Yankee bat.  Joey D put it in there.  He got angry at her.  It's a met bat.  Steve.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up, Steve?  Hello, Steve.  Hello.  Hi, Snuggle.  Hi.  I hope he didn't get a big enough line on his walkover.  What did I say?  What did I say?  You said you guys were talking about the two-year-old reading, and everybody's like, 
[02:30:00]  oh, that's fucked up because he's reading.  He goes, that's fucked up because he's black.  You don't know why?  Oh, my God.  Did you say that?  Yes.  I didn't catch it for a second.  It just took, for some reason, it took like five seconds, and it registered.  Like, yeah, he did say that.  I wasn't sure.  I missed that one.  Yeah, it was really good.  Well, because you're like, it's so fucked up that he's reading, and then this is why I  shouldn't get any acknowledgement, because in my mind, I was like, should I, should I,  should I?  You should just say it.  Just say it.  So I missed a moment, and I said, yeah, that he's black, or whatever. 
[02:30:30]  I thought you were going to say, because it was wrong to say that, you're just bitching  about the timing.  Oh, yeah, of course.  The comic timing.  You're right, Forrest.  I was like, hey, he's coming my way a little bit.  Nah, no, he isn't.  He's nothing to do with what's right or wrong.  Maybe a little.  Maybe a little.  He's still over there with Bill.  Bill O'Reilly.  I'm a little closer to you than these guys, you know.  Believe me.  Really?  Believe me.  Just a little bit.  Opie O'Reilly.  Believe me.  Really comes across.  I said a little bit.  Damien, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Jimmy had a line on the walkover. 
[02:31:00]  Bill Burr stuck all over it.  It's something about when your wife burns dinner, and then Bill Burr just jumped all over him,  and you couldn't even hear the audience.  I did that to ruin your day, sir.  There you go.  Mission accomplished.  I got a long day, and it's already done.  All right.  Yeah, that was a gem, sir, but you know, those are the moments you miss.  You know what?  Instant feedback is rolling.  Art from Boston.  Line of the day from Jimmy.  The line of the day competition today is going to be very interesting.  You guys better take it very seriously behind the scenes.  Yeah, you bastards.  Because there's some great ones today. 
[02:31:30]  But Art from Boston.  Line of the day from Jimmy.  My kid kind of based it.  Oh, yeah.  Mine's over there screaming the C word.  Eating dirt.  Eating dirt.  That's a contender.  As Jimmy splashes soup all over himself.  The soup Nazi sent out soup, but I'm having a little bit of love.  Now you know how your girls feel.  We got a lot of...  No, I'm not tied up.  We got a lot of press with the soup Nazi.  Yesterday.  A huge press release went out.  Press release that we're doing commercials for him.  I want low-fat soup.  A little strange, but...  We're joining.  All right.  We're joining forces. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, we got the...  The throgs?  This is horrible.  The trogs.  The trogs.  The throgs.  Sorry.  The thralls.  We got to find that.  We got the hidden tapes.  Jimmy, why are you eating bean soup at like 9, 10 in the morning?  Young man, I don't have the luxury of sleeping late every day.  I've been up since 5, 17.  This is like a little light lunch for me.  This is lunch.  Our schedule doesn't afford us to eat like normal.  That's right.  I don't have the luxury of waking up at 6.  Right.  Midnight snack at 5 in the afternoon.  Bill. 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  Let's go to Bobby from Chicago.  You don't know cold.  Bobby?  Hey there, Bobby.  Hey, Bobby.  Hey, Bobby.  Hey, boys.  What's going down?  You guys are the shit.  Yeah.  Bobby.  We know.  Hey, uh...  Hey, Burr.  Hey, uh, Bobby.  Yeah, you motherfucker.  Hey, I saw your ass at the Raider game a couple weeks ago, man.  What was going on with that?  I wasn't at the Raider game.  You were doing interviews in the parking lot?  No.  What are you talking about? 
[02:33:00]  Must have been Joel McHale.  Yeah.  Was it Bill Walton?  Yeah.  No, I was doing a thing for ESPN.com.  How'd you get that?  I auditioned for it.  I'll try to get you in there.  This is a comic thing.  Dude, I was doing this.  Who's booking that?  Are you looking for people?  How'd you get that?  How can I get in?  How can I steal that gig from you?  They're looking at you like they can't.  Like, why did they pick you?  You stink.  Let's move back to Mr. T.  54 years old. 
[02:33:30]  He's got a new show.  Yeah.  Is why he's in the news.  And he was on TV the other day.  He's got his Mr. T song, Be Somebody.  And remember, we were looking for a copy of it?  Yeah.  We got it.  And at the end of the song is Mr. T's inspirational diatribe.  Well, I've seen trailers for his new show.  And he goes off about what you should do as a kid or an adult or looking for a job.  Really?  Yeah.  Jimmy's opening a present.  He gets a lot of gifts.  I got a gift. 
[02:34:00]  Anthony, why are there no girls' cameras up?  I need to look at girls.  I just pop up a couple of cameras.  Anthony, I want to look at girls.  I don't know any of the girls' names or nothing.  You know what?  A big thanks to Sal Minardo for this gift.  What is it?  I'd rather not say.  It's a book called Pink Box Inside Japan Sex Clubs.  Oh.  Oh.  What goes on there?  I don't know.  Probably barbarism.  I bet it's awful.  It couldn't be good. 
[02:34:30]  I bet it's awful because they are perverse, uptight, sexually, people.  It's like the Germans.  Once your country loses a world war, you're taking out each other's genitals.  Or chickens.  I can tell by the picture on the back that it's just, or that's the front.  Oh, you never can tell with these people.  I was reading in Japanese.  Especially with the flat asses.  Can't tell if they're coming or going.  Give me those ribs and cab door, you.  Elbow, elbow. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  Toot-de-doo.  Toot-de-doo-doo.  Toot-de-doo.  All right.  What is that?  The first picture opened up at nude theaters, and they have a shot of a couple of pairs  of legs, and a pair of panties, and a couple of vaginas, apparently, from 1750.  Wow.  Because they've never seen a razor.  Holy shit.  Could you shave that fucking puss?  That's Ming Dynasty Bush.  I'm surprised they don't shave it.  It would humiliate the woman.  Jesus, that's all the Japanese people like.  I like this book already.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I might attract it to Asian girls.  Is it all Asian?  Or just Japanese? 
[02:35:30]  Or what is it?  Just Jap?  Wow.  I just have never.  Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.  Japanese girl with her legs open in a schoolgirl outfit.  That I like.  They rarely show, uh, show Bush.  Yeah, this is what I'm...  They gotta cube him out or something.  They'll show a chick, I mean, shitting into a guy's mouth.  Mm-hmm.  You know, allegedly.  And they'll fucking cube out the pubic hair, because that's offensive.  Yeah, that's offensive.  It's like the fucking Arabs, and they showed the decapitated U.S. soldiers.  They bleeped out the genitals. 
[02:36:00]  They cubed out the genitals.  Thanks.  They show the...  This is the Arabs doing this, not us.  How did the guy get the Segway up here?  Why is he...  Did he get the Segway in the elevator?  Why is he riding that?  He's riding the Segway outside the studio.  Boy, those things really took off, didn't they?  Wow.  That really is one of the biggest...  That's a five grand well-invested.  I believed the hype for a minute.  For a minute, it was like, I could see people rolling around in these on the sidewalk. 
[02:36:30]  It looks like the future.  It's going to be traffic jams of people.  Yeah, the internet.  Not the internet.  The inventor had a vision.  Oh, he had a vision, all right.  He, uh, yeah, he thought this was going to be it.  So did, uh, the guy with the last name of Edsel.  He had a vision, too.  So, so it happened there.  Look at that.  Yeah, that thing was supposed to be, like, replace everything.  Police departments were going to buy a whole shitload of them for foot patrol so the cops  could ride them.  And then, uh, that was it.  Then they realized all you had to do was run up a hill on some grass. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, and the perp's getting away.  Hey, you!  I can get this up to three miles an hour, you fucker!  Jump over a little stone wall, stay on the other side of it.  Yeah, and just laugh at him.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do, leave it there and chase me?  My buddy's going to steal it.  He's waiting for you to chase me on foot, you fuck.  That thing's going to go into the Smithsonian right next to the jetpack.  Yeah, jetpacks and Mylar suits and flying cars.  And a box of tang.  That thing, you are riding a failure. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How much fun could it really be?  The Segway.  The Segway.  Segway's back to walking.  Dunking Booth Douche.  Did Opie just say inspirational diatribe?  Jesus Christ, how does that get pronounced correctly?  And Korea gets an extra six R's.  Wow.  Remember that from yesterday?  All right, here we go.  Mr. T, be somebody.  Oh, boy.  I'm good already.  Everybody's got their time to play.  Right. 
[02:38:00]  I'll get in the mood when the Tom's on the day.  When he finds out his only guarantee.  He is to make sure that he will be somebody.  He is to make sure that he will be somebody who will be somebody who will be somebody in your head.  You heard me.  Everyone loves a real guy.  I love to see the phony looks from the producers as they're looking in. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  Gums up.  Yeah.  This is a take.  That's a take, JV.  Hey, where are the white women at?  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with your shovel.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  We have to continue.  I was digging it.  I want to be somebody. 
[02:39:00]  I do.  It's inspiring.  Here we go.  Here we go.  You can see how wager I'm going to fall from here.  That's right.  You know he cares.  You heard me.  You heard me.  You heard me.  I ain't playing.  I ain't playing.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I should have gone high.  Look at this one.  I should have gone high.  Look at this one. 
[02:39:30]  Excuse me while I whip you.  I got it from an Negro.  This is great stuff.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I want to get to the inspirational part at the end of the thing. 
[02:40:00]  David in Seattle.  What's up?  Hey, Matt.  Yeah.  I just want to call Anthony out.  He realized he fucked up a line there when he asked Jimmy about his Japanese sex book  that the Bushes looked like they were from the Ming Dynasty, which, of course, is Chinese.  Yes, sir.  I thought the book was Asian overall.  That's why I asked.  That's why I asked.  That's why I asked.  Is it Asian or just Japanese?  Because at first I thought Jimmy said Asian.  No.  I heard it, and I didn't know he fucked it up. 
[02:40:30]  You motherfucker.  I think he got you.  He did not get me.  I think he got you.  I was basing my statement on the fact that, whether I heard wrong or not, that it was an  Asian book, and the Ming Dynasty would have fit in Asian.  I think I'm an Asian.  I'm going to side with the listener just to be a dick.  This book smells so good.  Smell this book.  Seriously.  Does it smell like fresh book?  Yeah.  The smell of a new book and bean soup is going to make me puke.  Don't we have the fuck you line still?  Trust me.  Yes.  I miss it. 
[02:41:00]  You guys never advertise for it anymore?  Write that down.  Make sure Steve advertises the F.U.R.  You don't like the new book smell?  It's my favorite smell in the world.  Yeah, we'll get it back.  All right, David.  Thanks.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Here's the end of the song.  Like the beginning of the song.  Be somebody.  Be somebody.  Ooh.  Great guitar sound.  Be somebody that don't change nothing since 1984.  Hey, you.  Yeah.  You were the teeth. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Come here.  What?  Come over here.  What happened?  That's better.  Now I can see you.  You know me?  Of course you do.  That's because I'm famous.  But even before I was famous, I was still somebody.  And I got respect.  See, you don't have to be famous to get respect.  You just got to be able to beat people up and throw them out of bars.  You were a bouncer, asshole.  You were willing to take chances and risk falling on your face.  Because that's the only way you're going to learn.  And that's what I'm here for.  To help you be somebody.  Because if you're not somebody, then you're going to be somebody's fool. 
[02:42:00]  I think you made a lot of good points, sir.  I like the dead silence thing.  You see a fan go, ah.  What the fuck is he babbling about?  What the fuck is he babbling about?  Wow, is he awful.  Wow, is that not inspirational on any level?  Yeah, I like that.  All right, it didn't hold up over time.  How old was that? 
[02:42:30]  Is that new or no?  Who could tell?  He blew up around what?  83 with...  I wish, literally.  Rocky III?  Yeah.  Mr. T exploded today.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We got Bill Burr here.  We got Mistress Karen audio from yesterday.  We finally got that, Jimmy.  I love her from Arizona.  And the Trog Studio audio.  Andy Summers turned us on to this.  Is it good?  I heard it's reminiscent of Spinal Tap. 
[02:43:00]  Wow.  Nice cover.  Than is getting to be the consummate professional.  He can pass the buck when there isn't even anyone to pass it.  You just pass the buck to existence.  People were saying it's good.  Yeah, well, it's reminiscent of Spinal Tap.  People seem to have enjoyed that movie when it was out.  I'm looking forward to hearing exactly how it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't wait now. 
[02:43:30]  Hey, Butcher...  Fan in 08.  How do you pronounce this kid's name?  Butcher Ed Brock's WOW promo?  Butcher Ed Brock, yeah.  Butcher Ed Brock?  Yeah, he's been interning for us for a long time.  And as your buddy.  We have a guy there that works with that name here.  Who's buddy?  Who?  His name is Butcher.  Oh, Butcher, yeah.  Butcher.  Why Ed Brock?  Young Hetfield.  Venom.  What?  He's Venom from Spider-Man.  I use that as my alias because I got him tattooed on my leg.  Yeah, let's see the tat.  I like this kid.  He's got fucking major problems. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, Pantera shirt.  Let me see it.  Yeah, just evil tattoos on his calf.  He's all right.  He's like the last guy that any dad wants to pick up the daughter.  I got a R.I.P. Dimebag tattoo also.  Let me see that.  Yeah.  Wow.  You're a big Pantera fan.  Did you ever hear the interview with Phil a couple of years ago?  Paul, holy shit, that is the dumbest question you've ever asked.  And he has a Pantera t-shirt on.  No, it wasn't a quote.  It was a statement.  He's a big, like I was saying, wow, you're really hardcore.  That wasn't a question.  I was calling you out just to defend me against the Ming Dynasty thing. 
[02:44:30]  Wow, I was on your side.  I didn't care that you were sick or not.  Yeah, but it was to deflect, and I apologize for that.  No need for it.  Let me smell the book for you.  That is a good smelling book.  I'm trying to tell Bill, but he's rejecting me.  He's got a CD out called Welcome to the Slaughterhouse.  What's that about?  It's just like I put it together like two or three years ago.  It's like I actually, I'm all about metal, but I rap.  Oddly enough, I'm not no Big Daddy James, but I'm pretty good.  Is it sort of, who would you say it sounds like?  I've been told I sound like, what's this face from House of Pain? 
[02:45:00]  K-Fed?  Nah, no K-Fed.  That kid's good.  Then take your stuff and leave.  If you're not like K-Feds.  My motto is K-Fed or bust.  I say that a lot.  I've been saying it for years.  No, but I rap about like, you know, comics and porn and stuff.  You've got that crazy smile.  Comics and porn.  Is it rock rap kind of thing?  Kind of.  Like, I use other people's beats and stuff.  I would prefer to do like a rock rap thing.  Oh, you do?  He's got that coke head smile.  You don't do it live?  The teeth come together.  If you guys get a band, like, you don't have a band?  Nah, I've done stuff with a band. 
[02:45:30]  Like, I've done a live show with a band backing me up, but I don't actually, I wish I had  a band backing me up.  You know what you saw the other night?  Vinnie Paul.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were telling me you were going to go down to the strip club down in Dallas.  No, it's the Motley Crue.  He walks up, he goes, Jim Norton.  He knew me from Meet the Cream.  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  I'm incredibly jealous.  Well, Butcher did a wow promo for the show.  Ugh.  He raps over House of Pains, jump around.  You don't like the wow promo?  No, it's just this.  Smell the book.  It'll make you feel better.  This very young looking Asian girl licking a man's asshole. 
[02:46:00]  Let me see that picture.  What are you looking about?  It's kind of blurry.  What's there to look about, Anthony?  Is that legal?  Is this book legal?  Yes.  That chick looks like she's eight.  That's not legal, Jimmy.  You better throw that away.  I don't know what that is.  Well, she's got a horse.  It looks like she didn't want to do it.  No.  Do you know anyone who would?  Yes, I do.  I started strong on this program.  It was going good over there.  Dude, you're fine.  I have to relax.  Dude, what are you talking about?  I hope the show's been good for the past minute and a half, because I've paid no attention. 
[02:46:30]  I'm thumbing through this Japanese book.  They are some sick individuals.  Look at fat Jap women.  Let me see.  They're obese, fat women laying on a bed next to each other.  And here comes Japanese businessman after the pressures of work.  That must be those.  You know where that goes?  Awry.  I think we went through that yesterday.  I was so dishonored.  It still makes me laugh today. 
[02:47:00]  There are some attractive-looking Japanese girls in here.  I never had a thing for Asian girls.  And some real awful ones.  Check out Butcher.  Are you paying enough money?  On MySpace.  Butcher Ed Brock.  Let's listen to the WOW promo.  That's not bad. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, it's not bad.  It's hard to- my only problem is I can't really hear how good he is, because it's such a familiar  beat behind it that the beat is very distracting, because it's a very famous, great beat.  Yeah, very familiar.  But it's not bad.  Definitely.  Well, what song do you- I wanted to hate him for it, but-  Why don't we play one of his originals from Welcome to the Slaughterhouse?  I do stuff over, like, Dre beats and, like, 50 Cent beats, unfortunately. 
[02:48:00]  It's just beats that I like.  What song would you suggest us play?  Number, I think it's three, C4.  C4?  What's that about?  It's, uh, I just, like, it's a three and a half minute verse.  Like, a lot of people do verses and hooks and verses and hooks, and I like to go against  the conventional crap that I usually hear on the radio.  Yeah, I hate that, too.  Yeah, man.  Like, as much as I, like, rap, I don't like, you know, anything commercial you hear, I  probably don't like.  Who's the best rapper right now?  As far as I'm concerned, Aesop Rock.  He's an underground rapper.  I don't like it. 
[02:48:30]  No, he's good.  I don't like him.  Eminem's the best.  What don't you like about him, Jimmy?  The name.  I don't like the name, and I didn't like his fables.  I like Eminem.  Rush had one of the best raps in one of their songs.  Blondie did, too.  No, Roll the Bones is probably the greatest rap of all.  Great rap tune.  Okay, I can't even say what it's going to say.  Can you guys find the rap?  That is really bad.  The stupid rap thing that Rush did in Roll the Bones?  Oh, Football Father tasered, do we please?  Oh, come on, show it.  During a peewee game, he tasered him. 
[02:49:00]  Why don't they show it?  Fucking news.  Stupid news.  Maybe that's the right footage they had.  Oh, what, the guy turned the camera off when he was tasered and then showed it?  Because he was laying on the ground afterwards.  Hate that.  All right, we got Roll the Bones?  Rush, this is the greatest rap of all time.  Get busy with the facts.  No zodiacs are all relaxed.  No maniacs are polyester slash facts.  I'm going to kick some new year smacks.  It's a pair of relax, you dig? 
[02:49:30]  Give me your dig.  Small gets big, it's a rig.  It's action.  The action.  The plan.  The interaction.  So who's afraid of the abstraction?  Can't get no satisfaction for the facts.  You better run out.  This album should be spray-painted white and left on the side of a road.  Don't you hate when your favorite band gets sucked into a trend and you're like, don't go there.  Who is it?  Rush.  Rush.  This is Rush. 
[02:50:00]  When rap starts hitting the scene, they're like, they panicked and went, we better do something with rap.  We got to rap, so we're relevant still.  The rest of the song isn't that bad.  Fucking way.  Yeah.  This is in the middle of all the ball.  Fucking way.  This is Rush.  Who is it rapping?  What's his name?  The guitar player.  Alex Lifeson?  Yeah, it wasn't Geddy Lake.  No.  I would love to hear the outtakes where he tried to rap.  You think Geddy tried?  Oh, you know he did.  And they said, wow, we got to get someone else to do it, right? 
[02:50:30]  It happens all the time.  Your favorite band, it happened when disco hit and all of a sudden some of these bands  are like, oh.  Yeah, Kiss went disco.  When Kiss went disco.  Oh, what song was that?  I was watching some Kiss footage.  And I still love their old stuff.  Yeah.  But I was watching some...  Ozzy went disco.  What is this?  This is...  Jimmy got so annoyed with me.  I know, what's the name of the song?  This is...  I was made for Loving You.  It's actually a good song, though.  It's a little disco, though.  Soft Dynasty. 
[02:51:00]  Definitely disco.  But it's a good tune.  This is actually a really good tune.  Jimmy looked at me all annoyed when I said that Ozzy did a disco tune.  He looked and went like...  No, he didn't.  What Ozzy, so...  No, because he did a rap with Miss Piggy Ozzy.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's for the Muppets.  That's for the Muppets, though.  Oh, this isn't a bad song.  No, it's not.  We got Paul Stanley coming in the 30th.  It's a good song.  It's a dance tune, though.  Yeah, it's like 1980.  It's a dance, awful.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  It's a dance, awful.  It's a dance, awful.  It's a dance, awful.  It's a dance, awful.  It's a dance, awful.  It's a dance, awful.  By the way, the disco dance.  All right, enough.  The Taser video is up on YouTube.  The one we were just talking about.  By the way, when do I get to play my song?  We'll be playing songs at the end of the show.  I've been telling you.  I'm scared.  How about today?  All right, they have to go get it off of his website.  This song's been running through my stupid head for two days now.  All right, we end the show today with a Jimmy song.  Ooh.  A Jimmy pick.  I'm going to snap.  So, wow, that went quick.  Why do you think on stage?  Oh, you don't mean right now.  No, you want to check out C4?  Yeah, I want to hear this young man. 
[02:52:00]  C4.  Young Hetfield.  Yes.  What's the name of your band?  Nah, no band.  Just me solo.  I tried to be in a band.  I tried doing the whole metal thing, but relying on other people is just...  But you're known as The Butcher?  Yes, sir.  How do you spell it?  B-U-T-C-H-A.  Go to his...  Were the guys in the band cool?  One of them was.  The guitar player is the only person I keep in contact with.  Has a rapper ever spelt their name, like, correctly?  No, no.  No, you got to be him, I guess.  All right, here we go.  How about just a rapper named Frank?  I'm Frank.  Frank Belson's raps here. 
[02:52:30]  Mike Jones.  Here's C4.  Sam Adams.  C4.  Oh, wow.  I'm scared already.  I'm down and grotesque, cannibal-esque, giving palpitations, like Chris Fawley, now these  rappers banging their chest.  I'm back in the flesh, subtracting the rest.  No GAT can protect.  You best be packing more than just a Mac and a VET. 
[02:53:00]  I'm wielding like an axe when I'm VET, to rap to the tech.  Slaughtering my opponent, say, yo, this crack is the best.  I take a hit and pass to the left.  I'm passing the tech.  Pass my arrest, moving too fast.  I pass my death.  Reincarnate the threat so they never forget.  I smoke that bomb and blow that it smog right back to the west.  I keep an eye on my homies and turn my back to the rest.  While all you fucking posers have to flash slap to the chest.  Then all them wake them up, spend too much time under arrest.  By the time they come through, they buried under the rest.  I've got way too many rhymes and too much time to invest. 
[02:53:30]  When I'm applying pressure, blow your fucking lungs out your VET.  Cause there's nothing I love more than the taste of raw flesh.  Blood splattered on the wall, I paint a portrait of death.  I'm the baddest motherfucker coming out of New York.  Got a size 15 booth for sucking selling me short.  Equipped with a metal tip, they quits with a metal grip.  So sick it'll make your shit start blowing like C4.  All these so-called rappers depressing as Eeyore.  Never seen a white boy spit like this before.  Am I too good to ignore you?  Too stupid to pay attention.  Scoring all the rappers on spelling and comprehension.  I'm schooling them, only one thing I forgot to mention. 
[02:54:00]  If you fuck it up, the penalty ain't detention.  It's expulsion, leaving motherfuckers convulsed.  With a flow that looks thicker than Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.  Six million ways to die, so I chose.  Made it six million and one with your eyes closed.  Recommend you keep them shut.  Cause the last inceter step to me got burnt so bad,  you left looking like pizza to hunt.  I show my face on the block.  You shove your face in a cop.  My rap's a turn to pop and fly him through a vacant lot.  I'm faking not, I fake a lot.  I treat rapping like driving and when I park, I'm gonna take your spot. 
[02:54:30]  So take your shot.  I'm bitten on my rap point blank.  Armed with nothing but a mic, you and your boys I expect.  I'm blowing shit the fuck up, you just get shit popping.  Indestructible is not, no motherfucker can stop her.  Compare me to a genius, I ain't rock him.  But on the mic, I'll rock him and him and him.  It's clear to see that no MC comes near to me.  I'm feared to be the end of your career, so flee.  And clear the path, fuckers learn to fear the wrath.  Move inside or I'll control or delete your ass.  Massive respect I'm earning, motherfuckers can't stand it. 
[02:55:00]  Not every sermon, but I'm the green-eyed bandit.  Make your shit collapse, better check your schematics.  Moving when it comes to MCs, I ain't your average.  I ain't your jersey wearing, ice-locking, shit-talking, wankster.  Heard it straight from my mouth, nothing about me is gangster.  I ain't a hustler, I ain't a killer, and I ain't got a gap.  I'm the only crack in a rap without a sideways hat.  I ain't a thug, I ain't a G, and I ain't got a vet.  I'm just a white boy from Queens who's been lyrically blessed.  I ain't a player, I ain't a pimp, and I ain't been shot.  But I'm making myself at home whether you like it or not.  I ain't none of the above and I ain't telling you twice. 
[02:55:30]  Better take my advice, cause once I step behind the mic,  they say that I'm a motherfucking.  Mass murderer.  Mass murderer, natural-born killer.  And I don't want to die.  I don't want to die.  I don't want.  I don't want to die.  I don't know.  Alright.  To be honest, it sounded fine to me.  Yeah, it kept my interest.  Indeed. 
[02:56:00]  That's what I'm trying to do, man.  The beat in the background is very famous, so I have no idea.  Dr. Dre did it, I think.  I do want to break some news to you, though.  Yes, sir.  I got it.  This might piss you off.  No, not at all.  I'm down for criticism.  Alright.  You are white.  Yes, I am.  Alright, that's all I want to do.  But he addressed that.  Yeah, I make many references.  I've been told I make too many references.  Yeah, a little too many.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But white is the new black.  Apparently.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Watch your mouth.  It's happening.  Right?  Right, Sam?  I want to hear an insecure rapper. 
[02:56:30]  He's like bragging.  I do the best that I can, but sometimes I'm not up to mustard.  Comes up short.  I can't cut the mustard.  Alright, there you go.  I appreciate you guys checking it out.  Thank you.  The butcher.  Ed Brock.  Can I give a shameless answer?  My rhymes are mediocre.  They're not the greatest.  Yeah, what do you need?  Just myspace.com slash butcher.  B-U-T-C-H-A if anybody wants to check it out.  You got the butcher.  Nice. 
[02:57:00]  I thought someone else would have had that.  Did any of your rhymes have the butcher, not the baker or the candlestick maker?  No, no, no.  Good, because you're about to get hot soup thrown at you.  Yes, yes.  Good boy.  He's a good boy, this butcher.  Thank you very much, Jimmy.  See, you talk like a white guy.  I like that.  He's not trying to throw the inflection around.  Is that good or bad, though?  Because then you're doing your rapping, and it's...  Why can't white guys just rap like white guys?  It doesn't come off sounding good, does it?  No, not really.  I like to rap.  I'm not particularly good, but I like to have fun.  You knew I would. 
[02:57:30]  See?  I want to be back with Jimmy.  I guess that's why you're doing it that way, yeah.  Dude, could you bring in your high school photo?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why would I?  Because I just...  He has like a coke head smile.  See that?  I don't smile in my photos.  I got to...  I got to keep it not white like that.  You don't want to show anyone.  You might be happy.  Of course.  Yeah.  High school photo is just me with a bunch more zits.  What's your favorite rap of all time?  My favorite rap...  My favorite, like...  Song?  Come on.  I don't know, man.  There's so many.  Well, how about a couple of good ones? 
[02:58:00]  Wow.  Anything from Redman.  Time for some action.  His stuff back in 92.  I like real old school.  Ghetto Boys.  Easy E.  Easy E, of course.  When it was, you know, wasn't so hokey.  I'm really big in the Blowfly stuff.  Blowfly can suck my dick.  That's right.  Public enemy.  Fuck Blowfly.  Public enemy for me.  Yeah.  Yep.  I have to say, in the ghetto by Eric Baderock, Kim.  Yes.  Yeah.  Bill Burr?  Teddy Pendergrass.  Oh, Bill, he wasn't a rapper.  Well, I don't think he raps, Bill. 
[02:58:30]  Blondie and D.  Rapper's Delight.  I don't know.  All right.  We got to move on.  Very good, though.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thank you very much.  Good job, buddy.  I think.  Although...  I'm not going to act like I know this shit.  Eminem's Rabbit Run.  It's one of the best raps ever.  Rapping Matt Damon.  Yes.  He does look like Matt Damon.  That's right.  I say, what the heck?  Because my friend is Ben Affleck.  You know, keeps the language family-friendly.  I'm going to write a family-friendly rap.  Do that.  Yeah.  Let's work on that.  I'm not a pansy.  And yes, I get a hard-on thinking about John Bonnet. 
[02:59:00]  What?  Mistress Karen.  Shut your mouth.  Karen Von Croft.  All right.  We'll do it after the break, but it's a little tease.  A little, what, dominatrix audio?  She's a dominatrix from...  I have not heard the audio.  She's a dominatrix from Tucson, who is a for-real pervert.  I love her.  Or she's from Arizona somewhere.  I think she's the sexiest woman ever.  And what's up with Coconut Willie?  It was just a name.  He was a midget wrestler, and I named my cock after him when I was a kid, and I thought  it would be funny, but it just lasted for years. 
[02:59:30]  Coconut Willie.  Do we have any pictures of Coconut Willie we could get off the internet?  God, I hope not.  Oh, you mean the wrestler?  Hailing a cab.  Oh, there's plenty of mine.  I'm sure there's a screen cab from PalTalk.  All right, we'll step aside for a bit.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  We'd like to send out a big F.U. to the United States government. 
[03:00:00]  All them people up there, put that Hubble telescope up.  I mean, fuck, what do you think we are, idiots?  We all played with magnifying glasses when we were kids, cooked ants on the sidewalk.  We know that Hubble telescope's just a really fancy fucking laser, so get on with it.  Turn that son of a bitch around and cook something.  Yeah, this one's not exactly fun.  It's for all you people who've forgotten what the firefighters did down on September 11th,  and now we're just glorified garbage men again. 
[03:00:30]  Fuck you.  I have a channel just, fuck you, the J.R. Cigars in fucking North Carolina.  Motherfuckers called the goddamn police on me.  I was parked in front of their store for 15 fucking minutes,  buying shit in their fucking store,  and I got me a $135 fucking dollar ticket.  Motherfuckers, just fuck them.  Yeah, I just want to say a big fuck you to our secretary.  She's such a big fucking cunt. 
[03:01:00]  I want to give a big fuck you to Patrice O'Neal.  I finally got the photo I wanted with myself, Opie, and Anthony,  and I got stupid Patrice's gorilla face making a fucked up face in the background.  Fuck you, Patrice.  Fuck all y'all.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line at 866-FU-LINE1.  That's 866-FU-LINE1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, fuck him.  Yeah, talking about YouTube videos with Bill Burr during the break.  And he's like, oh, sorry, Bill.  And he's like, check out the motorcycle guys on YouTube.  These kids, they're fucking insane.  Totally.  They'll be going down the highway.  There's like trucks and shit behind them.  They're doing like 80 miles an hour, and they'll do like a wheelie,  and then stand up on their gas tank. 
[03:02:00]  I checked out one video, yeah, some kid on a highway somewhere doing a wheelie  at like 60, 70 miles an hour.  It looked like he was going that fast.  I don't know.  Maybe he slowed down a bit.  It was insane.  Yeah.  I saw one kid do it one time.  Like I was driving.  He was coming in the opposite direction.  And literally, there's like three lanes of people behind him, 60 miles an hour.  If you go down, the very least, they're going to run over a limb or something.  There's a group out on Long Island that does this.  They go out at night, sometimes even in the daytime, I guess, on Sunday mornings or something, 
[03:02:30]  and just do wheelies down the Long Island Expressway at 80 miles an hour.  They're just, wah, and then, woo, lift the front end up and do a wheelie at 80.  Anthony has the need for speed.  No, I'm obsessed with that.  Not motorcycles, man.  You will never, never see me on a fucking motorcycle.  That's probably dangerous.  What's he going?  Hey, could be, Jim.  Could be.  You know, Jim, I'd have to agree. 
[03:03:00]  On YouTube, man, they got like girls on the back hanging on, and the guy does a wheelie  real quick, and she goes flying up, and she's wearing like little booty shorts, and just  I mean, just lands in the express lane and rolls.  Yeah, that's good.  Tuck and roll, honey.  I think that was YouTube.  It was called How to Lose Your Girlfriend.  It was the name of the video.  Literally comes up.  All of a sudden, she's horizontal, and she like bounces off the seat like her titties  hit the back of the seat where she was sitting two seconds ago, and it's just,  See, I've fallen off a skateboard, dude, and for three weeks, I was hating life. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  This lady, she's got like a little spaghetti strap.  My boyfriend has a motorcycle.  It's fucking awesome.  Not dressed for a bike.  Oh, not at all.  We broadcasted from the X Games, and the most interesting thing we learned out there,  all these motocross guys, we interviewed all of them, the top names in the sport, and  And these are guys that take their bikes on these ramps, fly up.  I mean, how high up are they?  30 feet over the top of the ramp?  Way more.  It's insane.  I mean, over the top of the ramp.  Oh, yeah, probably, yeah.  30 feet, and then, you know, they'll land it, and they're racing around the Oval and 
[03:04:00]  stuff at 100 plus miles, whatever it is, and we asked every single one of them, they're  like, they're not crazy enough to drive their motorcycles on the streets.  Ride on the street?  They're like, hell no.  Hell no.  They're like, we're not insane.  Yeah, those kids, they're out of their fucking mind.  Yeah.  And it's not even what you're doing, other people on the road are so stupid.  I mean, I have a huge vehicle, and people, yeah, well.  Oh, my God, I just saw the video!  And people turn, make lefts in front of you all the time.  It's like, what, you didn't see this behemoth coming at you? 
[03:04:30]  You know, they're not going to see a motorcycle.  Watch this.  Watch this.  There she goes!  Oh, yeah!  Face plant!  I want to see her.  Oh, did she face plant!  Is that all they have on it?  Yeah.  Is she alright?  Yeah, some people get scared when they see it.  Oh!  That was...  Oh, her arms.  Her arms must have just been, because they're bare arms.  At least she was wearing a helmet.  Although she fell off doing a wheelie, so she might have bounced a little bit and not  slid as far as you do when you fall with the bike dragging you. 
[03:05:00]  I...  What?  Again, well, hold on.  I don't know.  Don't even comment.  What the fuck am I talking about?  Yeah.  I was really trying to visualize what the hell you just said.  Yeah, I actually do this, and I don't mean to do it.  It's not a bit.  I'm speculating on things, and I have no fucking idea what I'm talking about.  Like, I said that almost as if it could be a basic fact.  Like, well, you know, he sounds right.  I'm an asshole.  You know, you bounced.  Yeah, the wheelie's different than if, you know...  Chances are the wheelie makes you drag further.  I probably should have the exact opposite of what's true. 
[03:05:30]  On YouTube, it's called How to Lose Your Girlfriend.  Someone else is saying we should search out Motorcycle Hits Deer on YouTube.  Oh, the best cringe-inducing motorcycle video.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  Someone else saying Old Fatty Pig Fatty Promo, good.  New Fatty Pig Fatty Promo, fucking awesome.  Ah.  Steve, update it?  Yes.  Can we listen to that?  I'm a genius.  Yes.  I want to hear that as you find the...  Take your hand to it.  Here it is.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest began like a stampede of hungry rhinos. 
[03:06:00]  But now, it more closely resembles a sleepy, winded elephant.  The current heavyweight in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is Crystal from Cleveland, who weighed in at 430 pounds.  We're so sure there's someone bigger out there, we put up a fatty finder's fee in the amount of $1,000 to the person who brings in the heaviest girl by the end of the contest.  So grab your sonar equipment and find us a whale.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest gets $10 for every floorboard-shattering, tear-inducing, self-esteem-destroying pound on her body. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, girls, you make the rockin' world go round.  This contest was...  Go to opiananthony.com for contest details.  Excellent.  This contest was made for Steve.  It really was.  Yes, Steve.  It's like, I got jokes and woman-hating.  Oh, it's right up his alley.  He's right there.  He's Michelangelo.  That's why I thought he must have been under the weather or something, because I'm like,  man, Fatty Pig Fatty, and the promo, the first one, was all right. 
[03:07:00]  I'm like, this is Steve.  We're talking about this.  He's been rejuvenated.  Yeah, this is right down his...  All right, here's...  Is this the video?  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  This one is...  Dude, I watched these for like an hour and a half last night.  This is called what again?  Guy on motorcycle hits a deer.  It's a deer.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  What?  Wait, wait, wait.  No way.  What the hell is that?  Come on.  Slow it.  I'm not buying it.  You're not buying it?  Nope.  Why not?  Not buying it.  How about this?  It looked like... 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, so they saw a dead deer on the side of the road.  Slow motion.  Oh, wait.  That looks real.  That looks real.  Nope, it's drawn.  Nope, it's drawn.  Do it again.  Can we do it again?  Well, you know what?  Jim knows about the wheelie, so I'm going to...  Yeah, I do.  I know.  It looks like a cartoon with the animation.  It looks a little odd.  They're having a fast motion.  Where does it come out of?  The deer comes from the right side.  Yeah, I'm trying to see exactly...  Can you see a deer on the right side?  If it comes out...  Nah, that's fake.  It's too fast to really... 
[03:08:00]  Well, can we stop it?  How about this?  Can somebody...  How about this?  We cut and we stop it.  We get a copy of it.  We stop it on the freeze frame it.  We're trying.  Here's the slow motion.  There's a slow motion at 180.  Oh, no.  Yeah, go back.  Go back slightly.  You can see the deer kind of...  Watch.  Into focus.  See?  Here's the deer right there.  All right.  You can see through them.  All right.  No, it's another...  It's a video of a deer running that he slowly...  They composited it awful.  Exactly.  Because it's actually blurry. 
[03:08:30]  Now, let me see.  Go forward a little bit more.  That's ghost deer right there.  See if he goes in.  It's ghost deer.  And then, see?  It's coming to life.  And he comes in.  Now he's in frame.  Fake.  Go frame by frame.  I want to see what happens.  I don't know.  It's totally fake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I ain't buying that.  It's a total piece of shit fake.  And the camera...  Fucking Bambi looked more realistic than that cocksucker they threw in there.  How about you throw in the Kennedy motorcade, too? 
[03:09:00]  The fucking deer got hit behind the Stemmons freeway sign.  Fucking assholes.  It's really cringed dosing.  No, it wasn't.  It looks like an episode of South Park.  Yeah.  It was fake deer.  Fucking horrible.  Who suggested that?  I don't know.  Smack him in the head.  Some listener.  The most cringe-inducing moment because of the bad fucking...  Yeah.  Listen to me.  Two seconds later, I was just going, it's real.  Now I'm completely fucking up.  That's real fake.  Really an episode of Davy and Goliath. 
[03:09:30]  Here's the...  Let me see this.  All right?  Fan, turn that screen.  Sorry, we're messing with YouTube again.  This is from yesterday.  We had this girl kick this guy in the mouth.  Oh, kick him in the nuts.  The video's finally up on YouTube.  No way.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  Watch this.  Oh my God.  This girl came out, she was outside the studio to meet John Cena.  She was a sexy black chick.  She really kicked him.  Yeah, I'm glad Sam got a real good angle on that.  Sam is fucking...  It was perfect.  He got him from the back.  Get the guy from the back.  Yeah, why wouldn't he stand facing him, Sam? 
[03:10:00]  He might have made up for it.  And how about panning down a little so you can see...  He's behind the girl over her shoulder.  Zoomed into his face.  Tight close.  I zoom out.  And just missing it again.  All right, he missed two fucking shots.  He's the fucking one cameraman.  Holy shit, do you stink.  Sam, how did you miss that?  Oh, damn.  There's no defense.  Oh.  What?  Wait till the last one.  No, wait till the last one.  Why would that mic be on, by the way?  You know, of course.  You have to open it and zoom on the whole thing on his balls. 
[03:10:30]  That's one shot.  Yeah, because people...  Look, again, you zoomed out the second...  You missed it.  Oh my God.  That's the third one.  There better be a fourth one.  Stop with the fucking push shots, Spielberg.  Or you're back to getting coffee.  Who directed Pluto Nash?  All right, here's the last one.  He finally has a crotch shot.  Yeah, because people, when they watch YouTube videos,  we'll wait till the end, hoping that it gets better.  Just show this one.  Take the other ones off and show this one.  All right, there you go.  People aren't going to wait through... 
[03:11:00]  Oh, it's slow motion.  All right, you make up for it in the end.  People aren't going to wait through the three lousy ones.  Yeah, well, tell David Lynch to fucking stop all over the place.  Show the cock and balls in the foot.  End of story.  By the way, we started the bit, by the way.  People doing crazy stuff on the walkover.  Wow.  People out there trying to get our attention.  You now have an opportunity to show us your talent.  Are you the guy that films Bigfoot when you fell off the horse?  That awful tape of Bigfoot.  I will re-edit.  Where he stops and waves at the camera?  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Stops, turns, waves.  I thought he's running a post panner.  He's looking back like he's going to...  Yeah, he's going to...  By the way, I knew we were going to have one of these shows finally.  Pat from Foxborough.  Search for Merry-Go-Round of Death on YouTube.  That is my Merry-Go-Round of Death.  Everyone is saying the deer hitting the motorcycle or motorcycle hitting the deer is totally fake.  Of course, it's fake.  We saw. 
[03:12:00]  That's why I made my very, very funny Stemmins freeway sign joke.  Exactly.  That's why I made my very, very amusing joke.  Deers don't appear out of thin air like that.  Yes, they do.  When you're driving that fast, they look transparent.  Oh, you can see them at that speed?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, then it's real.  Sorry, Bill.  It's kind of like after you've done a wheelie.  Yeah.  And you bring the bike down like nature, for some reason, is transparent.  It's transparent for a little while.  Yeah.  And if a chick falls off the back, she doesn't get as hurt as if she just fell off the bike.  If you bounce on tar.  That's the Jim Norton principle. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, if you bounce on tar at 80 miles an hour.  I could just make myself physically ill.  As opposed to when the bike drags you.  Yeah.  You know.  Okay.  If he was going a little faster, he might have gone right through that see-through deer.  Here's Merry-Go-Round of Death.  Merry-Go-Round of Death.  It's two people in the middle of one of those playground-type pushy Merry-Go-Round things  that you usually puke on.  And it's being powered with something.  Oh, the back end of a motorcycle.  Oh, okay.  That had a hurt.  They put the rear wheel of the motorcycle on the little metal Merry-Go-Round that you see 
[03:13:00]  at a lot of schoolyards and used the motorcycle tire to power it, to spin it, and had two  people in the middle.  And, of course, these people know nothing of the principle of centrifugal force.  Watch her.  Because...  See, this is what white kids do in the suburbs because, you know...  Nothing else to do.  There's nothing to do.  Did they think that perhaps somebody might fly out?  I would say this isn't the greatest video ever, though, on YouTube.  No, it's not the greatest because...  It's good, though.  ...the damage...  Oh, wow. 
[03:13:30]  They don't say what happens.  We don't get a damage report afterwards.  A lot of people get all fucked up when they see something like that and shut the camera  off or go to help.  They're not reporters.  They're friends of these idiots.  At least with the fucking beheadings.  They're like, a lock bar!  And then you hear the song playing.  They put their head on the back.  It's all tied in nicely.  Right.  It's all by the script.  By the way, Angry Pirate from New Hampshire.  All right.  Having fun watching videos, boys?  Enough with the fucking YouTube!  All right.  Good point.  You know how it is with YouTube.  We got distracted, mister.  You got distracted.  And it's like our little pics. 
[03:14:00]  Well, you can talk about football.  You can't see the game, you motherfucker.  You can't see it.  But people talk about it on the radio and know I'm bitches.  We're talking about something you can go and see right now.  Yeah, but we're not sitting there watching the game going,  Ooh, that was a nice pass.  Yeah, yeah.  See, that's true.  Okay.  By the way...  You're right, Bill.  I'm really excited with the listeners today.  Damn it.  I think I'm trying to make it...  By the way, boo!  I'll just boo you.  Then I'll storm out of here. 
[03:14:30]  One of the greatest YouTube videos.  Yes, we know about Car Faceplant.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I've seen that one.  I don't know about that.  The kid.  Oh, get it for Bill.  Oh, yeah.  Let's waste more time.  Fuck the listeners.  This is one of the hottest videos on YouTube.  This is way up there.  Opie, what'd you pop in the thing?  What sound to it?  The dominatrix.  We're going to try to get to something for once.  Why don't we start talking about the dominatrix thing and I'll watch the video.  That way, everybody gets appeased.  All right.  Here we go.  That's a nice Jim Norton word, huh?  Appeased. 
[03:15:00]  Car...  I like your Green Lantern sneakers.  Car Jump and Wicked Faceplant?  Me and my grandmother said Lantern.  Green Lantern.  The bottle of something?  That's the worst when you actually get a good one, but then you say it wrong and you end  up getting trashed.  Jesus.  It's a pod calling the cattle black.  Yeah, that...  Lantern.  Here, show the guys this and then we'll move on.  I'm sorry.  Look at this.  I'm sorry.  It's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[03:15:30]  All right.  It's a guy, parking lot, car speeding toward him.  He's going to do that famous stunt where you jump up...  Over the car.  ...over the car, which is usually done with a very short car.  Yes, sir.  What is this?  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  That guy had to die.  Sorry.  Yeah, that's a broken neck.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He jumps up.  He hits the hood.  The back of the car slips.  Oh, boy.  We should have done it right on his...  Oh, man. 
[03:16:00]  That had to be a paralyzing injury.  Well, they will never show you because once again, the fucking video ends.  The camera goes down to the parking lot.  The camera rolling?  No, they're all a bunch of scaredy cats.  Do you ever think that maybe they care about the guy?  Yeah, they'll care about him with the camera rolling.  If they cared about him, they'd fucking talk him out of doing it.  Right.  And not hold the video camera.  Make the commitment.  No, come on.  If you're going to actually stand there with the video camera and watch an idiot do this,  you've given up any right to saying, I should have helped. 
[03:16:30]  I shouldn't have taped.  No, you're there in the first place.  The guy's an idiot.  What if you believe in your friend and you think...  You think he's going to make it?  And you want to capture the moment?  You got to do it with a Volkswagen Buggo.  I want to see someone do that with a Kenworth.  This guy's doing it with a fucking Hummer.  The Kenworth.  Just wham.  So there's this dominatrix.  Yes.  What's her name again?  Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Karen Von Croft.  Is it Tulsa?  It's somewhere in Oklahoma.  Tucson, Arizona.  How do you know?  Huh?  I'm crazy like that.  You brought it up earlier, didn't you? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  She's in Oklahoma.  Wasn't it in Tempe?  And I've never met her, unfortunately.  I'd love to meet her.  I think she's...  How do you know about her without meeting her?  I forget online.  Again, I found her online somehow from a link.  Surprised.  And then I...  From rateme.com.  Dude, I fucking...  I beat my dick in a raw hamburger meat watching her videos.  Rate me with a lantern.  We got some audio.  My dick looked like jerk chicken when I was finished. 
[03:17:30]  Ground chuck.  All right, there's this broad...  She's a foreign girl.  She's a weird accent.  All right, here we go.  Let's listen in.  I like men.  I like to use them for my pleasure.  I tie them up and I whip them.  I whip them so they understand what is in store for them.  If they don't perform the way I tell them to. 
[03:18:00]  Their body belongs to me.  Does it?  I like to tie them up, blindfold them, and use their tongue for my pleasure.  I like to smother them so they know.  She better be.  They can breathe when I let them, too.  Your voice makes me want to cave her head in.  Give them back.  This is...  Why would you let somebody do that to you?  This is something...  No, no, dude.  She's a dom...  Phil's with us. 
[03:18:30]  We're talking about this deal.  We're talking about dominator.  I'll fucking let you breathe when you want to.  No, no.  With her ass in your face.  We were talking about that yesterday.  She makes you clean her ass.  She lets you lick her pussy.  She goes beyond where doms go.  And she puts her pussy on your mouth.  She lets you.  Jeez.  She lets you pleasure her.  Amazing.  That's part of the game.  Boy, that's...  But this is an interview I've never heard before.  This is not one of her sex videos.  This is probably just a troll.  I know.  Did you get that creepy tone?  I know.  He has such an understanding about it.  Dude, she's just fantastic.  Oh, God.  She's fantastic.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Look. 
[03:19:00]  Just hearing her voice and thinking about it.  He's all filling up.  She's the best.  Fucking Jimmy and his magical cock.  She's sexy, man.  Jimmy and his uninhibited cock.  She's fucking, dude, because she spits in your mouth.  She pisses in your mouth.  And she's like, go on, drink it.  And she fucking means it.  She's a good girl, man.  See, if you're into that.  But we were talking about it the other day, Bill, about these dominatrix and how they're  like, yes, lick my shoe.  Lick it.  And I am so not into that.  And I have a complete lack of understanding of the people that are.  I would, like, punch her in the face so hard that she'd be crying and why did you... 
[03:19:30]  In my world, that's the same as.  Why don't you go to the store and go get me something?  Fuck on my toes.  Get the fuck off.  I'm watching the game, you fucking quack.  I just, I don't understand.  I got, like, I literally got annoyed as I listened to that.  Yeah.  Here's what I like about her.  This is why she doesn't annoy me and a lot of dominatrixes do.  Because to me, they disconnect from sex.  You're not allowed to do anything sexual with them. 
[03:20:00]  You lick their booze.  Wow, that sounds great.  So you just take their shit and don't get the fucking cum.  Well, it's all, no, it's all about getting your whipped and shit.  Whereas her, at least in the video, I'm sure she's one slave.  She, like, whips you.  She does all the shit these guys like.  But then she puts her pussy on your mouth.  You lick her ass.  Like, that's what I would want to do.  You know what?  At least when Jimmy talks about this, you want to hear him go, what am I talking about?  I'm an asshole.  I know nothing about this.  No, this is your expertise.  Exactly.  You are a professor.  Let me use my pointer.  He sounds like a music critic. 
[03:20:30]  It's like a sundial.  It was over there, now it's over there.  He's like, you know, with a lot of people in this genre.  Yeah.  A music critic.  Oh, she fucking, she'll whiz in your mouth.  She's a fucking good girl, man.  You brought that up three times.  I know.  Go on.  He's trying to keep his heart up.  Drink it.  Hey, come on.  Let me fucking smash your fucking heart up.  Do you drink it or let it, like, run down your cheeks?  Oh.  Why would you insult me?  Exactly.  Why would you insult me?  Because I know nothing of this.  I can't let it run down my cheeks.  It's like when you're in a restaurant and you sniff the wine, you take a taste, then 
[03:21:00]  you dump the rest on the tablecloth, don't you?  No, you don't.  You drink it.  Oh, I can smother them so they know.  You like a certain vintage?  They can breathe when I let them to.  I will put them back in a cage when I'm done with them so they are handy when I need  them again.  See, this interview to me is not good and it doesn't, like, it doesn't, that's not 
[03:21:30]  what turns me on about her.  That's exactly how annoying she is and it's how weird you are.  No, dude, I'm telling you.  I've watched her videos.  Yeah.  She's fucking, yeah, man.  I'm not into most of the stuff she does.  I'm not into fucking my cock tortured.  But, like, she just does things that other times.  Nice high heels on the testicles.  But, dude, there's videos of her fucking, like, jerking guys off and it's just, like,  not what they do normally.  She ties in at least some kind of sex with it, which to me makes it much more real.  But it's all sex on her.  You saw it.  Like, you can't.  No, she jerks you off.  Oh, does she?  Yes.  What a girl. 
[03:22:00]  I think she's got probably one regular slave for disease reasons because she's not using  a rubber with him.  But, yeah, she grabs his dick and some of them.  Oh, okay.  Where do I give her the engagement ring?  Well, she's fucking taking his dick.  She's rubbing it on her pussy.  It's like, come on, man.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  That's what I would want.  I'll give you that much.  I will.  Let's go to Cleveland.  I don't think she's like that with her keyboard.  I don't know if she's like that with her clients, though.  She's clean.  Or just with the right.  No, I'm very clean.  When I jerk off, here's what I do.  All right.  I have the mouse on the right side.  I take the mouse, and the mouse pad's sticky because it's, like, going through the glass.  Oh. 
[03:22:30]  It goes.  I pull it off.  That doesn't drive.  I put it to the left.  I move my keyboard to the right, and I awkwardly left mouse while I lube up and jerk off with my  right hand.  That's what I do.  Awkwardly left mouse.  You're clicking on the wrong things.  It's awful.  I'm ready to come.  I'm opening Microsoft Word documents.  Let's go to Todd in Cleveland.  Todd.  Oh, oh, oh.  Tax info, 2003.  Fuck.  Todd.  Yeah, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to know, did you check out her video, Chastity Restrained? 
[03:23:00]  No.  Oh, dude.  That's the hottest one, where she has them tied up, you know, on the floor.  He's got the cock tube on, and then after she takes it off, she jacks them off into a  cup and makes them drink it.  See, that wouldn't do it for me.  The jacking off into the cup is fine, but I'm on it to drink and cum.  Also, there's one called Dressage, which is a video where she has another chick, and the  other chick is sucking the guy's cock, and it's only on video.  I wish someone would have that and send it to me, because I would love to see Dressage.  I've jerked off to that fucking promo about 40 times. 
[03:23:30]  Wait, what is it?  Dressage.  It's a promo where she's, like, smacking her slave's ass, which, again, is not my thing,  but this other fucking lady comes in, and Karen directs the girl or something, and then,  like, at the end of the footage, like, the girl is sucking the guy's cock, and then there's  other footage from the video where fucking, I think the chick is riding the guy, and fucking,  and Von Croft is straddling his face, going, go on, lick my ass.  So she's sitting on the guy's face while the other chick fucks him, or at least grinds  on his dick.  It's really hot.  It's fucking really sexy. 
[03:24:00]  I mentally tapped out of that.  Oh, no, you didn't.  A minute ago.  I just stopped listening.  Look on the promo for Dressage.  How one of these, it's a free clip.  How one of these guys get Dressage?  Dressage.  Dressage.  Fucking lovely.  So, uh, the Tron.  I'm almost digging Dressage.  You are.  You're digging Dressage in a hardcore way.  I don't blame you.  It sounds silly, right?  Fucking nice.  Two, uh, DVD set of that one.  Nice fucking Diet Dr. Pepper and some Dressage.  We're all happy.  Jimmy's just searching around the room for a friend.  Anybody.  Burr.  He's so much out. 
[03:24:30]  Fucking Burr I wouldn't even consider.  Those are normal guys.  Is that broad's name?  Karen Von Croft.  V-O-N-K-R-O-F-T.  Karen.  I'm getting through Karen.  It's K-A-R-I-N.  Why would you do that, Karen?  They were going to find the dildos.  They were going to find the dildos.  They were going to find him, Karen.  No, they weren't.  That's all we had.  Karen Von Croft.  I got the Von part.  Croft.  K-R-O-F-T.  Hey, like wine is, uh.  K-R-O-F-T.  Like wine, is P better the older it is? 
[03:25:00]  Yes, I expect the year of asparagus, I prefer.  And she has a big fat puss, too, man.  Hey, uh.  We did whatever we wanted.  By the way, douchebag.  We were wise guys.  Douchebag listener from Whack Bag.  You know a straight man.  He goes, you know, a straight man should never have to say, I'm not into drinking.  Go.  Wait, she's dressed in like a Nazi hat.  Oh, there you go.  Well, I guess we found your fucking.  We found your fetish.  Here we go.  I've been caught collaborating. 
[03:25:30]  I have gold teeth.  Go.  He definitely goes to the gym.  That's great.  Dude, she's fucking a big meat pussy.  Taps you on the ass with that riding crop.  Tells you she's going to make you into a lampshade.  Oh, now I'm filling up.  You're going to put all your luggage in one?  Oh, she doesn't even jerk you off.  You just have to look at your suitcase being dragged out of the room. 
[03:26:00]  Jesus.  Let's go to Katie from California.  Katie.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hey, baby.  I just wanted to tell you that it's not dressed, it's dressage.  It's what?  It's dressage.  D-R-E-S-S-A-G.  What's that mean?  It's a formal style for riding an English horse.  Oh, okay.  All right, what a dope I am, dressage.  What an asshole.  D-R-E-S-A-G.  I'm a fucking moron.  Well, dressage.  Well, you know what it is?  I'm going to go home and get a message.  I want a message with a happy ending. 
[03:26:30]  God, am I a dummy.  Dressage.  Versace.  Dressage.  Dressage.  Okay, thank you, dressage.  Wait, wait, how does Katie know this?  Oh, I'm riding.  You've ridden?  I guess they ride him like a horse.  She's just, yeah.  That's purely equestrian.  Are you guys getting dressage?  Oh, my God.  No, I'm not into dressage.  Is anybody out there doing it?  Every guy into dressage is homo.  No.  By the way.  No, I mean literally riding like that. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, side saddle?  Riding with an English saddle.  What's an English saddle?  That's a saddle without a saddle horn for real working men.  Tell Sandy.  And it's got like a little, it's very small, just fits your ass on there.  And the stirrups are up really high.  And when the horse is trotting, you have to do something called posting.  You do this.  You ride with the little short reins.  You don't have nice long reins to whip the horse's ass with when you want them to go faster.  And then you've got to do this. 
[03:27:30]  You've got to bounce up and down with the trot of the horse.  What a great manual.  And do it.  It is the dumbest looking thing.  Get a western saddle and be a man if you want to ride a fucking horse.  Yeah, absolutely.  A bunch of faggots.  And never hug your loved one again.  That's right.  Whatever that was, I'd fucking...  So what?  Every birthday, every Thanksgiving, you had to rub noses like Eskimos.  Oh!  Why do girls ride side saddle then?  That's something you could put back in the olden days. 
[03:28:00]  That's why the cunts didn't get stuck to the horse.  The horse got tired of his back smelling like that.  It was during, uh...  All the fucking buzzers would attack the horse, but only in that one spot.  That's 50 fucking gulls fighting for two square inches of horseback space.  With that, I've been riding across the countryside pussy smell.  I believe it was the Victorian times.  They didn't really like women to sling their legs over horses and ride like that. 
[03:28:30]  It was very...  That was their very uptight era.  Yeah, yeah.  Anything with a female genitalia was taboo.  You know, girls were all covered up.  And you swing that leg over, you might catch a view.  Can you imagine if you actually knew what the fuck you were doing back in the day as far as like fucking around with the woman?  You'd probably get laid by every bitch in the village.  Oh my God, you'd be a legend.  You'd be a legend.  What were they doing?  Just big stinky guys going, ugh!  Just pounding them.  I'm a lady!  A little finesse.  Fucking turkey leg in one hand.  Fucking battle axe in the other. 
[03:29:00]  Get over the fact they didn't bathe for a month at a time and just perfume the hell out of it.  They were awful.  Great.  That's good.  Let me go down to Fulton Street and spray some perfume on a trout.  Same fucking thing.  That trout ain't gonna smell no better.  You ever smell fucking period box?  It's offensive.  I now understand why fucking Jamaicans won't even let women prepare their meals when they're on the rag.  Fuck that period smell.  What do they cook with their pussy?  No, I don't know.  Jamaicans just don't want them dirty period hands touching their food. 
[03:29:30]  Wow.  You can open dressage in here.  All right, we're gonna take a break.  I just love the word now.  We're gonna go find dressage.  I'm just gonna say dressage now because I like dressage.  I don't.  Hey, when we get back, we got the Trogs studio audio.  I want to hear them cursing at each other.  It's kind of Spinal Tap-ish.  We got turned on to this by Andy Summers of the police.  We'll do that next.  Boobs always bring this show to a halt.  Oh, screeching halt.  Boobs always bring this show. 
[03:30:00]  I see boobs.  Yes.  He just got wowed.  Wow.  Hey.  It was amazing. 
[03:30:30]  That's nice.  We'll be in Anthony.  Hey, yeah.  Yeah.  It's world-renowned.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Those are real.  Cancel your appointment.  Okay.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  What the hell is he doing over there? 
[03:31:00]  You just go a little bit to the left and you haven't read that book yet, have you?  I've been busy.  You never did.  You know what?  It's busy trying to get some speed in his life.  It's on my night table, and last night I picked it up to read it.  I'll get you that book on fucking video.  Book on video.  I love that.  Conjections of an Economic Hitman. 
[03:31:30]  Who Killed the Electric Car is a great one.  And I'm not doing it.  I'm not like this.  I'll watch that.  See, I'm very good with watching a lot of those things.  They got pictures and stuff.  Pictures?  And they move.  I like moving pictures.  And then there's music.  Oh, I like that.  Reading.  Reading takes too long.  Reading.  You give me a copy of that book.  I'll read it.  Huh?  I can have my kit mail.  I'll read it.  Well, I think he has it underneath.  I'm going to read it.  You're not.  Stop it.  I'm going to read it, too.  But first, I want to see why the police broke up.  So I'll be reading that first. 
[03:32:00]  Or the top 100 stupid celebrity quotes.  Yeah.  All those are great.  Yeah, now that's good.  It's a quick read.  I usually keep it in the can.  After.  You know, a couple of paragraphs.  You're done.  You wipe.  You're out.  He's literally going during the break.  He's like, wow, Bill, you were just on the inside.  It's fucking at Barnes and Nobles.  It's right there.  It's like you're one of the.  I mean, you're thinking is like you're part of this grand conspiracy.  And you're letting out the information.  That's what it seems like. 
[03:32:30]  I'm not like.  It's not like conspiracy.  It's business.  It's just business.  And, you know, and you spin it.  It's like when you come home late and your girl's like, where were you?  You spin it.  Yeah.  You spin it.  Yeah.  Like.  There's no conspiracy, though.  Oh, the fucking train, man.  I figured, you know, I'd take the subway.  I don't know what I was thinking.  And it just, you know.  I wouldn't watch.  And then the money train came by.  It's bullshit.  You kill a couple of hours.  Look at that nice big cock.  Yeah.  Hey.  See the birds?  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  Nice.  I eat your crop on him.  Yeah.  Good.  It's really harder.  Oh, yeah.  He can't speak that.  I mean.  See, this is all video.  It's not good on sound.  I wanted video, not sound.  We can't play that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's holding a guy's collar while the other chick sucks his cock.  I'm sick of Jim saying that this person is, we're not doing it justice. 
[03:33:30]  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  She's sexy.  Oh, great.  We get to watch the video.  Karen Von Croft.  Yes.  And you know what?  I don't like your white shadow fucking sweatshirt.  I know.  Especially with a salami in my pants.  This guy's naked with his arms tied behind his back.  He's wearing like a gimp hat.  He's being whipped on the ass.  He probably has the hat to protect his identity.  He never shows his face to this guy.  It's probably her personal fucking fucktores.  He's got a collar on.  All right.  Well, she's helping him out a little bit there.  She's got a collar and the chick's blowing him. 
[03:34:00]  How do you not want that to happen?  Get your fanny smacked.  Straighten you out.  I don't even like my fanny.  He's smacked, but I'd take it.  So, the troggs.  Oh, the troggs.  Finally going to get to this audio.  Ties you up with police tape.  Pain in the neck band name, by the way.  The troggs.  The troggs.  I get it.  Wild thing.  Yes.  That's all we know.  Studio audio from the band.  Yeah.  Engineer was rolling some tape.  They were in the studio and had a little bit of a tiff, I believe. 
[03:34:30]  Band member knows he has a number one, but it needs something.  This is very Spinal Tap-ish.  Before Spinal Tap.  Yeah.  Whether you think so or not, that is a number fucking one.  And if that bastard don't go, then I'll fucking retire.  I fucking do.  I think he's a good song.  I agree.  He's a good song.  But it fucking won't be unless we spend a little bit of fucking thought and imagination  to fucking make it a fucking number one.  Wow.  You've got to put a little bit of fucking fairy dust over the bastard. 
[03:35:00]  You know, like the, you know.  You've got to put some fairy dust over it.  Well.  I'll piss over the tape.  I'm a fairy dust.  Do you know what I mean?  It's, it's, I don't know what, I don't know what it needs, Dan, but it needs, I know  that it needs strings.  That I do know.  Right.  Right.  And it needs something at the beginning of that number to make the, somebody remember  it.  Look, yeah, while we were arguing here, we could be trying to get some, some sound out  there.  We're trying to get something right.  So what do you suggest we do, Dan? 
[03:35:30]  Give it up for the night.  No, not at all.  I don't say give it up.  Baby.  I'll stay here till tomorrow night.  Baby.  I'm hooked on this.  He, uh, that is so spinal tap, it's ridiculous.  Yeah.  The two guys really yelling, the one guy just kind of chiming in.  That's good.  Well, in this clip, they wonder where, uh, whether or not they need a producer.  You've got to have a fucking bloke that says, I've got a fucking sound in here that's fucking  great.  Come in here and I don't fucking listen to it. 
[03:36:00]  And you come in here and it's probably a different fucking tune nearly.  But if it's fucking good, yeah, that's it.  But when we go through that door and we think, oh, fuck, no, you know.  I would have left it exactly as it is, as you've got it now.  What producer would do that?  I don't know.  It might be.  You don't know.  He might say, keep it like that and put whatever else, strings or whatever.  We wouldn't have signed a contract with him in the first place.  Who?  Any producer.  You don't have to sign a contract with him. 
[03:36:30]  What?  You don't have to sign a contract with a producer to have a record produced.  We'd thank you and good night if we left it the way it is now.  Ah, you'd see, then you'd argue with him.  Yeah.  But no producer would leave it like that.  You don't know.  No.  No.  No producer would.  You know, he might say, we'll put other things on it, we'll overdub, you know, we'll put  strings on it or brass or whatever his idea is on or a fucking wobble board, I don't  know.  Yeah.  But would you agree to that?  Well, for a back of the start, I don't suppose it is. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, yeah, sure.  Would you agree?  Would you have a producer sit here and say, that's it?  That is what we want.  That is what we need.  Because you can see the way we're going on.  We need a producer to say, no, you're not doing this.  That's what we need.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Nothing's getting done.  Oh, my God.  This is so, and it's the Trogs, so obviously it means nothing.  Because they, you know, they were known for one song. 
[03:37:30]  Right.  What song?  Wild thing.  Wild thing.  You make my heart sing.  Do they ever have another song?  So they're freaking out at this point.  They're kind of realizing they might be a one-hit wonder.  Yeah.  Get a fucking producer.  You can't play the fucking guitar anymore.  It's your fucking wife, isn't it?  Love this computer magic.  Here's, after trying a riff, guitars can't get it the same way.  What you were doing is exactly the same as what you were doing originally. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  Only you were doing that.  Yeah, I know.  And you did it.  And you did it.  You went.  You can say that all fucking night.  But you won't listen.  We can keep on trying and then you can get it together.  Yeah.  Well, just shut your fucking mouth for five minutes.  Give me a fucking chance.  We'll do it.  Don't get fucking.  Fuck.  I don't have fucking microphone.  What is it there?  What is it there?  Fuck me, Reg.  Just fuck off in there.  Yeah, but you fucking think.  We're not going.  Just keep going fucking through it.  Don't just keep saying, I know that's right. 
[03:38:30]  I know that's fucking right.  I can fucking hear it out right, you cunt.  Oh, nice.  Nice use.  You know what?  Nobody says cunt like the fucking Englishman.  They love the word and they know where to use it.  That was perfect cunt usage.  That's silly goose in London.  Yeah.  Don't just keep saying, I know that's right.  I know that's fucking right.  I can fucking hear it out right, you cunt. 
[03:39:00]  Well, fuck me, you say.  I can hear it's fucking not right, too.  I'm fucking crannin'.  I'm the cunt that's playing it.  So when I can hear it in me fucking head, yeah, that's what I've got to fucking do, then  I'll do it.  You big pranny.  You big what?  I don't know.  Pranny?  Pranny?  Look that up.  What's that mean, pranny?  You big pranny.  I'm guessing fag.  Someone that prances around?  I'm guessing it's a style of riding a horse.  Maybe he meant pranny.  Maybe the guy's a shrimp.  It's a vagina?  A vagina?  That's what it says.  Oh, you big poo-ha. 
[03:39:30]  So it's just another form of a C word.  Drummer and rest of band, this is the last clip.  I can't agree on what the beat should be.  These guys are a mess.  Well, yeah, you fucking, you're talking like the back of your fucking asses, because all  you want, then, is the same fucking thing that I was playing.  Fuck it, I'm trying to get that fast.  I'm different fucking drums.  I'm different drums.  Well, then, all you want, then, is the fucking fat one and the fucking bass drum playing the  same thing.  You're the drummer.  Yes, you fucking do.  Because that's all you're fucking doing.  You ain't playing any fucking thing else. 
[03:40:00]  All right, I play that.  I'm going...  That's a hit right there.  Yeah.  Hey, what's that song?  Do it.  He had the hit right there.  What the fuck was that?  Hey, every high school band playing that, right?  That's Traffic or our Spencer Davis group? 
[03:40:30]  So good.  Stevie Wynwood.  Well, you know what the fucking song is, you silly cunt.  Bloody Stevie Wynwood fucking would.  Give me some lovin'.  Give me, give me some lovin'.  The Trogs also sang Love Is All Around.  That's coming in like crazy on the instant feedback.  What the hell is that one?  We all know Wild Thing, but we're trying to find out.  Oh, boy.  That's not the Trogs.  Love Is All Around?  You feel it in your fingers and your toes?  No, we're not.  We're just saying that the drum beat, he had that song.  He had their second hit right there. 
[03:41:00]  Their hit was just sitting there.  But they're too angry.  They probably were as great as the Beatles, but they had one angry guy that fucked it all up.  They're all angry.  What do you want to write, some faggy fucking song?  He starts playing like Stairway to Heaven.  I'm trying to write a fucking hit here with fairy dust.  You're fucking poof-da.  This is fucking bloody awful.  Smoke on the water, what are you going to do with it?  It's fucking fog.  You should be doing more about wild things. 
[03:41:30]  No, no, fucking Stairways to Heaven.  Things that are crazy.  People are saying you're thinking of my shoulder.  You don't take a Stairway to Heaven.  You're fucking float up, you silly cunt.  All right, what's this song?  Years later.  Love Is All Around.  This was the Trogs, their other hit.  This is fucking in Greece.  This is summer lovin'.  This is no hit. 
[03:42:00]  Stop.  This is the song they play when you're like, when are they going to play wild things?  Yeah, what the fuck is this?  Where's the hook?  Maybe we know the hook.  It's funny, listen to them yell and then hear this shit.  Yeah, all this. 
[03:42:30]  All right, the hook should be coming out.  I know they had to do this like a hundred times.  Formula.  What you need is this underneath with the audio of their argument over it.  You know I love you, I hold you.  What do you think you're fucking talking at the back of your fucking asses?  Because all you want then is the same fucking thing that I'm playing fucking record right now.  All right, all you want then is the fucking, that one is the fucking thing that I'm playing the same thing.  What do you think you're fucking doing? 
[03:43:00]  Because that's all you're fucking doing.  You ain't playing any fucking thing now for sure, I'll play that.  I'll play that.  Oh, that's funny.  Very funny.  Goddamn.  You can say that all fucking night, but you won't listen to me. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, but just shut the fucking mouth, boy, but instead of giving me a fucking chance to do it.  Don't get fucking rocking that fucking microphone.  Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.  Yeah, that's what I've got to fucking do. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, I'll do it.  You're making funny.  Did he say, I'm the fucking cunt that's playing it?  Holy shit.  I didn't do that the first time around.  Plus he's gritting his teeth.  Oh, he is pissed.  That's terrific.  That's great with a nice little love song. 
[03:44:30]  R.E.M. didn't cover this?  Yeah.  Did they?  I've never heard this song.  I thought they should have.  I've never heard this song.  Brother Alamo knows all about R.E.M.  Do you?  All knowing.  Not really, just somewhat.  Sounds like something they would do.  Yeah, it was one of the unplugs.  It was one of the outtakes or something.  I haven't.  I don't listen to it.  I invented unplugged.  Robin.  You ever hear the R.E.M. song?  Yes.  My brother actually turned it on to me.  Turned it on.  Turned me on to it.  Sorry.  Michael Stipe just singing the acknowledgements of an album. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  It made it sound like a song.  Really?  Yeah.  The voice of Harold.  He's reading the liner notes of a spiritual album from the 60s or something, and he's just  reading it.  He's reading the addresses of what you write to them.  Taking a big chance.  That's a pretty fucking presumptuous.  But it sounds like an R.E.M. song, and all he's doing is reading the thank yous from  an old album.  It's called Voice of Harold.  All right. 
[03:45:30]  Let's go to Sal in Jersey.  Sal.  I got it.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, Sal.  Hey there, Sal.  What's happening?  Okay.  Sorry.  What's happening?  A radio show.  Yeah.  Up until you called.  Car crashed me.  Why, Sal?  Now, go ahead.  I'm a huge fan, Jimmy.  I'm glad you like the book.  Thank you.  The book?  He sent the book, it looks like.  Oh, the book.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, thanks, man.  It's really cool.  It smells good, too.  It's got a nice book smell.  Oh, Sal who sent me the pink book.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you see the eating chairs?  I think it was on, like, 86. 
[03:46:00]  Is that with the hole in the bottom of the chair?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great for tinkle and whatever else.  I fucking saw the fucking chair, you stupid cunt.  Yeah, I was the one laying under it, you fucking cunt.  I think you need to fly to Japan now.  Nah, I'm not into Japanese girls.  The expressionless faces.  Nah, they just don't.  Asian women have never done it for me.  They're very beautiful women, but I've never, that's just never been my vibe.  But thank you for the book, man.  It smells good, and I will certainly enjoy it.  I'll find something here to jerk off to.  No problem.  I'm a huge fan of Ollie, so I got two virus shows. 
[03:46:30]  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Right.  Okay.  Far craft me.  Thanks.  Nah, you're right.  I want to dress in a high school uniform, provides kuguri isu service.  That's what they call in the eat ass.  That's what eat ass is?  Kuguri isu.  Don't order that at the sushi restaurant.  Can I have a seaweed salad and some kuguri isu, please?  You'll just see a real puzzled look on her face.  Yes.  A panicking look.  Oh, boy.  We haven't had this one in a while.  You eat the seaweed salad, and they'll fucking cube it out, because it looks too much like  pubis.  All right.  Follow me. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  Kuguri isu.  A sumo wrestler is involved.  Hey, we got to say thank you, bro.  I forgot your name.  Come on in.  I forgot his name.  Why do we have to say thank you?  Peter.  Peter?  No, it's not Peter.  Oh, this is a creepy guy from the elevator.  I'm not creepy.  I'm not creepy.  Be a selfish piece.  The way you just said I'm not creepy was so creepy.  The way you got your hat.  That's the scene.  Jim got me so bad, it's not even funny.  Oh, you told him it was Pete?  Yeah. 
[03:47:30]  That's good.  No, I'm good.  Goddamn, Jim.  Oh, you're funny.  Yeah, Kojo.  Kojo.  Yeah, yeah.  Kojo's an artist, and he did a little piece for us.  That's going to be a Maxim magazine?  It might be.  Oh, no.  See, you're probably going to be hanging on your wall.  I don't know with the serious, and I'm not sure.  Oh, they have a Maxim thing deal.  I'm not sure.  But I think you knew that going into it, didn't you?  Yeah, of course.  That was your excuse to come in the studio.  No, no, for real. 
[03:48:00]  No, I've been working for Maxim since 2002, pretty much consistently, almost every issue.  I'm an illustrator.  Censorship, man.  And a fine artist.  So let's be honest.  It's not going to be in any magazine.  Well, no, they're doing an article about my fine artwork, my celebrity portraiture work.  I'm doing a portrait for Kevin Smith.  I'm doing a portrait for Rick Ross, Mike Tyson, you guys.  And I told them, you know, that when they said they want to do this article, I said, you guys, I'm doing one of you guys.  And they were kind of psyched about it.  Well, can't they do the free FM version?  There's an XM version.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:48:30]  I mean, that's what I'm going to pitch.  Well, tell Maxim this.  Exactly.  If this doesn't make it into the magazine.  We've been around the block, bro.  They are going to get fucked in any magazine.  We'll make their life miserable.  The bashing they are going to get is going to be mind-bending.  We go right from we might be able to make this work to complete blackmail.  I love it.  It's like, well, we're not sure because they got to, boom, let's just kill.  Hey, Sirius wants to fuck.  If that magazine would allow Sirius to tell them what to put in their magazine, then they deserve every fucking horrible phone call they get. 
[03:49:00]  And believe me, they will get off.  Oh, well, they get, and it won't stop.  It won't stop.  It won't stop.  It won't stop.  Rally the troops.  Get them on the border.  Troops to the border.  Troops to the border.  If they're going to allow Sirius to send to their magazine and fucking hurt the profile of this show.  The country of Maxim is ready for an attack.  The pests are going to have one of those Kremlin parades, you know.  Oh, yeah, with the missiles and tanks and goose-stepping people. 
[03:49:30]  I think you knew that it was.  No, no, that was one of the selling points that got them to do it.  That got them to want to write an article about my portraiture.  The portrait is nice.  That's very nice.  It's up on opinionathlete.com.  You've done a lot of these.  Yeah.  Wow.  We are going to bring them down.  Or at least ignore them.  They're good guys.  I'm sure they're terrific.  They could be good guys.  They'll show that they like us.  They might be wonderful guys if that picture ends up in there.  Yes.  Or they're going to be very busy hanging up the phone, guys.  Yes.  What we need is some sort of tribute to show that you... 
[03:50:00]  They're going to be known as nothing's getting done, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pests have a way of getting all fucking the office numbers that you're not supposed to  have.  Oh, everything.  And they don't stop.  Oh, they never stop.  They never stop.  They're horrible people.  And I hope you guys have HBO on speed dial.  But no, seriously, guys.  I've been listening to you guys since the beginning in New York.  And I really am glad that I got to be able to do this for you.  You're glad that you're not allowed to do it.  I like the order.  I like the order to do it for your wall, too.  I mean, just to have it up. 
[03:50:30]  To have an actual huge piece that I...  Yeah.  All right.  We'll invite other artists to come in and do portraits.  That's like being in Maxim, too.  Having it up on the wall right here.  Exactly.  That's just like being in Maxim.  You know, when you said we were going to be in Maxim, and that was the reason you came  in.  Why don't you flex some muscle over there?  Go, look.  This is my work.  I want this in there.  Well, yeah.  Let's rally the troops.  Freedom of the press.  I'm just talking about you.  Like, you go in there and bring up that whole freedom of the press thing. 
[03:51:00]  Maxim's been weird the last couple months.  So they've switched their whole staff up.  You know, a lot of the guys have left.  So you're walking on eggshells, are you?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I haven't done anything since issue 100.  That's right.  We'll help you out, because you'll end up getting a better job.  Yeah.  After you get fired from Maxim.  Well, I'm not on staff or anything.  I'm totally freelance.  Okay, good.  Oh.  Yeah.  Maxim, you're going to get a fucking horrible beating if this doesn't make it in.  Oh.  Because you know why they're keeping the show out.  For serious.  It's nice, though.  It's us in the studio, and it's a bunch of stuff that's associated with the show all 
[03:51:30]  all over the place.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very nice.  All right.  Thanks, Pete.  Yeah, whatever.  I want a copy.  Yeah, whatever.  Nice, Pete.  Look at people who see your stuff, man.  You got a website?  Yeah, artsucks.com.  You can get to everything through that.  Artsucks.  Artsucks.com.  One word.  A-R-T-S-U-C-K-S.  And don't bash him.  He's been a good guy.  Yeah, we like you.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  And the artwork is good.  Don't leave.  I want to get inside one of them.  Do we have time for line of the day?  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  I don't know.  Very, very, I don't know. 
[03:52:00]  There are a lot of entries, I would think, today.  How many?  I'm thinking.  I would say.  Three?  I'm hoping.  I hope I do well today.  Are we going to play What Did We Learn Today, or we don't have time?  Big Rhonda, what's up?  Hey, who's this?  It's Opie.  How are you?  Hey, Opie.  Hey, my man.  What's up?  Hey.  What's going on?  Your site's doing good, huh?  Your man?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Yeah.  I want to tell you, I signed five autographs.  Did you really?  I swear to God.  Big Rhonda is one of the girls in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  She's not the leader, but she certainly impressed a lot of people with her hernia that's sticking 
[03:52:30]  out of her belly button.  Oh, right.  It's the size of a half a golf ball.  Right.  And our intern, Craig, sucked on it like a nipple, and that video is up on YouTube.  She was a true...  Thank you for the Harmony, Bill.  A true champ.  I know, right?  I was.  I know.  I was.  I'm so famous in Maplewood now, it's pathetic.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pathetic, but it's great.  Blowing guys all the time now, I'm thinking.  Hey, listen, I'm calling.  Is Jimmy around?  Yeah, I'm right here, buddy.  Jimmy, how you doing, babe?  Good, how are you?  How about those tickets you're going to send us?  Can we still get them?  What? 
[03:53:00]  Hmm?  For the Hammerstein Ballroom?  Yeah, for your comedy show.  Stop begging.  We don't send tickets to put you on a list.  Just remind me as time is getting close.  Oh, all right.  We will put you on a list.  All right, can we come to the Halloween party?  I'll come in my G-string.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  We'll get you on stage for that.  No problem.  No problem.  That sounds great.  I love you guys.  Big Rondo, you're great.  I love you.  You did some great stuff for the show.  The videos are up on YouTube.  Big Rondo.  How many tickets do you need just for her?  Probably two, right?  That's section 101.  Ticket master. 
[03:53:30]  Line of the day.  I'm good musically.  Line of the day.  Well, what are the runner-ups?  Two runner-ups today.  Oh, no.  Two runner-ups.  Say both Jimmy.  Wow, this is good.  No.  It's definitely got one in there.  The competition.  Oof.  I am going to go with Anthony as the winner today.  No.  I never feel confident against Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton's got a knockout punch.  See, I could dance around the ring and maybe get a decision every so often, but Jimmy's  got the knockout punch. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, you had a knockout punch today.  Yeah, you had a really good punch.  I'm feeling good.  I don't know.  I never feel confident.  I'm feeling good for you.  I feel low self-esteem.  All right.  Here's one of the runner-ups for line of the day.  Well, the grandma probably knows that there's the Tourettes, and then there's just  the, she's kind of a bitch.  Yeah.  I think grandma has to hold on to a paint shaker or something for an afternoon to see  how it's like.  A lot of a paint shaker.  How it's like.  That's very good.  I stammered through the whole thing.  The Tourette's grandma.  I stammered through the whole thing.  See, that shows how strong the joke was. 
[03:54:30]  It's still good.  Even though you were a nervous belly, it still played.  Your porky pig threw it.  It's still, uh...  Hey, there's a little Mel Tillis, but it worked.  I say, I say, I say, hold on to a paint shaker.  All right.  It still worked.  We got another runner-up line of the day.  What do parents do that have terminally ill children?  Oh, get a break after a while.  God.  Oh, no.  I thought that was...  That's a second place. 
[03:55:00]  That is a god damn good line.  That's an awful, awful joke.  That's a Tyson uppercut, man.  Get a break eventually.  Yeah, that was mean.  Oh, that was a fucking beaut.  All right.  Line of the day.  Sponsored by BodogFights.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on BodogFights.com.  A mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any seen before. 
[03:55:30]  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  You go to, you know, all the other guys have their kids playing T-ball.  Look at my son.  You hit a base hit.  Really?  Mine's over there yelling the C word, eating dirt. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would not have even minded taking second on that one.  No, you know something?  I don't mind taking second to that line.  That is a funny line.  Thank you.  God damn.  All right.  I guess we're just about done, huh?  Bill, nothing to promote?  Comics from Home.  MySpace.  And your YouTube video.  That's getting hit like crazy.  Yeah.  MySpace.com slash Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.com.  Okay.  Bill Burr.net.  Bill Burr.org. 
[03:56:30]  I have the Hammerstein November 10th.  And New Year's Eve, I'm doing the Borgata in Atlantic City.  Tickets will go on sale Saturday, this Saturday at 10 a.m.  I'm going to spend my New Year's Eve with Jimmy Norton.  I'm very happy you're going to be there.  I am so psyched for this.  I'm very happy.  You're going to drive your car in?  Hold on a minute.  No.  I'm going to take the helicopter.  Oh, really?  No.  I just said that to sound important.  Hold on.  Is the Palatone camera on here to laugh for you?  Hold on.  Phone's ringing.  Oh.  Hello.  It's a banana.  Not really a phone.  And Jimmy picks it up like it's a phone. 
[03:57:00]  I don't know how he does it.  Not really a phone, guys.  Yeah.  A lot of people saying co-winners today.  There's nothing wrong with co-winners.  I'll accept that, Stan.  I'll accept a tie for first.  They should have a showdown.  I'll accept the tie.  They should have a showdown.  You got one minute to come up with a better line.  Ed Norton.  Hey.  I have a friend outside the studio for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Simon from Houston.  All right.  Well, bring this monstrosity up.  What?  Right now? 
[03:57:30]  Look out the window.  Is it going from a cell phone?  Is it coming in from a phone?  There's no...  Have her take the stairs so she's sweaty, too.  Yeah.  Is it coming in from a phone?  Plus, he smells like a lamb, a fucking...  It smells like shawarma.  Someone look out a window.  They're outside the fucking K-Rock studios.  I'm going to spit in both their faces.  Oh, especially since that would be in Cleveland?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, free FM.  Of course you do.  This is what I wear when I work out.  It's a banana headband.  Yeah, you know. 
[03:58:00]  Or a riot.  Yeah, you know.  Well, I don't know.  If she shows up, we'll wear her anyway.  Brother Elmo, the plug again?  Well, what happens if a fatty's pregnant?  Does that count?  Like, could she get something else on this?  That would count, and that would be, wow, what a strategy that would be.  That would be a good move for the second-place person.  Sure, it would be.  They could bang real hard and, you know, carry the weight.  Unless, of course, they spontaneously abort during the weighing.  Then the fetus has to be removed from the scale. 
[03:58:30]  Not if it stays on the scale, though.  If it falls on the scale, then it's fine.  As long as it's still attached.  As long as the umbilical isn't cut.  Usually we have to do it.  The umbilicus.  You have to pull the baby, and I don't mean this to be vulgar, but you have to pull  the fetus out of the cunt and throw it on the rug, and then weigh her, and then take  the fetus and shove it back up her cunt, and then weigh it like that, and subtract the  difference.  I mean, pardon my French.  I had to pick a song going in a... 
[03:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Write down your song.  Is it too late?  They got it.  I think this is the song.  It's been in my head for two days.  Brother Elmo, last past standing.  Yeah, Saturday at FH Riley's, if you're in the Long Island area and not going to the  Islander game.  I'm going to go after the game.  Come on down.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village. 
[03:59:30]  We've got some pests going up there.  Gaz, Fleabag.  Well, flea man.  We have a whole...  We have a little bit of everything.  We have Pat from Munaki, so it's going to be a good time.  Are you emceeing?  Oh, Pat from Munaki.  And I'm emceeing.  Brother Elmo's emceeing.  I'm going to need some tips from people in this room.  Who's the hole?  Whack, bear, get.  Esther.  I don't know her.  Wow.  She's around.  You've seen her face.  So you're going to host it?  I'm hosting, so any advice.  At least I don't have to be funny. 
[04:00:00]  Saturday?  Yeah.  I got a Westbury Music Fair on Saturday.  It's not even called that anymore, but...  What do you want to see?  Adam Ferrara is down there for one of the comedy festival things with Joey Cola.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Who else is down there?  I think Bobby Valentine.  Already the fucking New York Comedy Festival stuff?  Yeah.  Bobby Valentine, the wrestler?  No.  Gary Valentine.  He's going to kill me for getting his name wrong.  Mr. Valentine is going to be down there.  Gary.  Gary from King of Queens.  His brother is Kevin James.  Yeah.  Yes, Gary.  He's a funny comedian.  Gary.  I haven't seen him in years. 
[04:00:30]  He was very funny.  Yeah, and my buddy Adam Ferrara, of course.  Of course, Adam.  Adam's all right.  So I'm going to head down there, check those guys out.  But, you know, you never know where I'm going to be on the weekends.  I could get from point A to point B in minutes now.  Minutes.  Take your time.  No.  No need to rush.  You know, I haven't even put it in sixth gear yet.  Why would you?  I don't even know.  Why would you?  I don't even know what that's like.  I do eight miles an hour in my caddy.  I have one cylinder.  It's all I need.  Vroom.  Just one big one.  I yell vroom.  Thud, thud, thud.  That's eight horsepower.  Just pulls me around. 
[04:01:00]  Vroom.  All right, Jimmy, are we ending with one of your songs?  I hope so.  It's something that my friend turned me on to.  Yeah.  And I'm fucking, it's been in my head for two days.  I got to hear it.  It's a, I never heard of the person before.  Citizen Cope.  I think from New York, actually.  I think it's a New Yorker.  Citizen Cope?  I have no idea.  It's always called Sideways, and it's fucking been in my head.  What is it about?  Just someone who's got some thoughts that keep coming back.  And he likes it.  He's knocking them sideways.  And I like the tune.  Very cool.  Let's check it out as we leave you today. 
[04:01:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right, restart it.  Oh, he's giving you the finger.  Stupid.  Why don't you be like a DJ?  All right, a little song by, uh...  Wait, you need the name of the radio station.  And they got to start the song, too.  You know, you could call it the home of rock and roll.  You could talk about how much your rock rocks.  Or you could be, like, an animal, like the wolf or the fox.  Okay, uh...  Or you could be one of those KISS stations, KISS FM, Z100. 
[04:02:00]  I got it.  All right, Jimmy's got it.  All right.  W-C-N-C-R.  Cancer, the station that really grows on you.  Oh, my God.  Probably program directors out there going,  That's genius.  Wonderful.  Off the top of his head, ladies and gentlemen.  All right, well, all right.  A little number called Sideways, uh...  Written 1922 for a little picture called... 
[04:02:30]  I don't know, uh...  A person called Citizen Co...  What happened?  We got one.  You got a fatty out there?  Now we have to.  Is she near 430?  She's big.  All right, let's get up here.  Now we gotta do this.  I say we got a couple minutes.  Let's do it quick.  Let's do it quick.  I don't know if we can leave on time for once.  What?  Scale's on its way.  If you only knew...  How big is she?  That fucking mistake  might have gotten us a new fatty.  Me joking with young...  Me joking with fucking open-toned sandals homosexual  might have actually fucking... 
[04:03:00]  I see that?  I put Derek and Travis together.  If the elevator cable snapped, she won.  Hey, how are you?  You don't even have to see her.  Hi, how are you?  Wow.  Hey.  Hi.  How are you?  You're a big gal, but I don't know.  I don't know.  You're cute.  I don't know if you're gonna win.  She's cute.  Hi, guys.  You're cute.  Where are you from?  Texas.  Texas?  Uh-huh.  You drove up here?  Everything.  Yeah, we know.  You flew from Texas for this?  Yes, pretty much.  Not for y'all, but I came to see you on the walkover.  Oh, you did? 
[04:03:30]  I missed you.  How big a gal are you?  She couldn't keep up.  Huge.  How much do you weigh?  You know?  I don't weigh as much as the one that's winning.  4.30, you don't think?  I kill myself.  You don't think you weigh 4.30?  I hope not.  That's pretty big.  Yeah, I don't want to weigh 4.30 is big.  Let me see, because you're wearing a little sweat jacket.  You've got a body like Misty Met.  Oh, don't be nervous.  Don't be nervous.  Now, let me see.  Open up your jacket a little, because I can't see.  You're going to be waving, selling tires.  No, I'm saying.  I'm tall, so that's at least the good thing.  You're tall, which is good.  You know something? 
[04:04:00]  Could be very deceiving.  She is tall.  You wearing heels or anything?  35 feet.  What was the last time you were weighed?  They were heels an hour ago.  Wait, what happened?  Did I miss?  Can line of the day transfer over to tomorrow?  I missed it.  What was it?  Yeah, listen to the replay.  I'm wearing sneakers.  They were heels an hour ago.  No.  I'm teasing.  I know.  No eye contact.  I know.  No, I'm totally kidding.  I know how y'all are. 
[04:04:30]  She knows she's a big girl.  Yeah.  But she's not, you know, your hair looks nice.  It's not all greasy or anything.  Yeah.  Because some big people just completely give up on taking care of themselves.  No, I'm trying to lose.  I am losing weight.  I lost 20 pounds before I got here, so.  I might have been losing a few grand now, see?  I know.  You lost weight.  That's okay.  I just wanted to meet you guys.  Oh, yeah.  That's all right.  You lost some weight.  And I've already seen you guys in Houston, so.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yes.  Oh, Houston.  Got lucky with Jimmy, did you?  No.  But he was nice and gave me a picture, and I wanted you to sign it.  Aw, Jimmy.  Aw, Jimmy.  He is a sweetie pie. 
[04:05:00]  I should pull a Jeter.  Now I've got some stuff to do.  Not win a ball game.  Nothing.  No.  I enjoyed it.  Let me tell you.  They were heels an hour ago is unfollowable by all of us.  Nothing.  Thank you.  Groundhog would walk in here, and he would just be shit after that.  I want to bring up my line, though.  What's your line?  Oh.  She said she, uh.  Is it going to be me?  No, you wanted.  Yes.  She wanted to join us for the walkover.  I knew what you said.  I was literally.  And I said, well, it looks like you just caught up. 
[04:05:30]  No.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  That's very good.  I was in the wrong section.  I was on 55th Street.  I didn't realize you were on 57th.  She couldn't.  I basically said she could keep up when she probably got here.  He was implying, though.  I know what he's saying.  That due to the morbid walkway.  She'd have made it here, but Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd were shooting lasers at her.  And my other one, man.  She got distracted walking through the Midtown Tunnel.  Scott, Jersey, what's up?  She's right here, for God's sake.  It's okay.  I know.  I can't do it.  No one's funny to me.  You can't do it, Bill? 
[04:06:00]  No.  Come on, Bill.  One.  I can't.  Yeah.  Come on.  Have some fun.  No, I can't.  Have some fun.  Bill, you're one of my favorites in social media.  She was walking through the, uh.  If you can't say anything, just punch her.  No.  No, you can say it, Bill.  I don't care.  It's flattering.  No.  I'm not going to say it.  She was walking through the Holland Tunnel and got confused because she thought she  was, uh, being born again.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, okay.  Now that's gone too far.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I thought yours was so nice.  No, we are nice.  That's, uh.  See, I didn't look at you when I said that.  Yeah, everybody's just staring at their microphones.  I can't really get.  You look like a retired lineman. 
[04:06:30]  I can't really get a good.  There's good slipping that in.  Uh, I can't really get a good line on your body because of the, yeah, a little bit of  the jacket.  Because you're more bottom heavy than top heavy.  You're not big in the shoulders.  Okay.  Uh, you're more like mid heavy.  Let me see.  Back up a little.  Did we see a snake that's just eating?  Beep, beep, beep.  I just wanted to see your legs.  Tell me.  If, uh.  Yeah.  All right.  Look, see, your calves aren't big. 
[04:07:00]  No.  Your shape.  I'm a weird person.  Odd.  Yeah, you've got like an odd body type.  Yeah.  Your bottom.  It's right here.  And the top.  Yeah.  It looks like you're wearing a barrel under your clothes.  It feels like I wear a barrel under my clothes.  Keg shaped.  Yeah, keg shaped because the legs are okay and the shoulders up are fine.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't you have to be up in the air for the Met game later?  I'm not the blimp.  No.  Oh, is that a blimp joke? 
[04:07:30]  No, don't.  No, don't.  I know how you guys are.  Don't let him do it.  You know what?  He just hates himself.  No, I love myself.  And that's it.  No, I love myself.  I really meant that shit.  Is that what he said?  Where's the scale?  Hey, uh.  Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  Yo, you guys blew right past Opie's brilliant line.  She's got a body like Mr. Met.  Well, it's a nice local reference.  Yeah, they're flying now.  We want like overtime line of the day now.  Overtime.  Cut it up. 
[04:08:00]  Bonus round.  Yeah, it was a tie, so, you know, we have to have overtime.  It wasn't a tie, unfortunately.  I thought it's...  Yeah, I didn't.  I'll agree.  No, no, I'll take a tie on that one.  No, Jimmy's line was...  No, Jimmy's had it.  By the way, you saw the car crash me on the Holland Tunnel thing.  That was really hacky in bed.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the meanness of it saved you.  It was very mean.  It was just...  Just the fact that you stammered through a...  You're born out of a tunnel because your mother has a big cunt and look at you joke.  I mean, that's...  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Do you come from a big family?  Well, yeah.  Yeah? 
[04:08:30]  I don't mean, like, a lot of sisters and brothers.  I mean...  Well, I'm big, but I was also...  This is gonna...  I was, like, athletic when I was a kid, and I'm not, like...  I could keep up with the...  But were you big as a kid, or...?  No, I guess I started gaining weight.  As a kid?  I'm not.  No, I wasn't athletic.  When you give up sports when you're two months old.  I guess I got bigger at 10.  What?  Okay.  At 10...  Hold on.  What did you play?  The ring ding?  No.  At 10, you then started getting bigger, but what were you like? 
[04:09:00]  Like, gymnastics or something?  What?  Soccer, and I wasn't the goalie.  Oh, what?  Soccer.  Oh, soccer?  I wasn't the goalie.  No.  Just lay there in a green shirt.  Your knees are wobbling, guys.  No, no, no, no.  Stay up.  Stay up.  You're fighting a good fight.  You're fighting a good fight.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  Fight back or something.  Do...  No, that's good.  So, but then what started happening at, like, 10 that would have made you start gaining weight?  Was it just food?  I eat shit.  Is that it?  All right.  At least I like the honesty, because a lot of people are like...  Well, it's in my family, or I... 
[04:09:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  I've got a thyroid problem.  Low metabolism.  Yeah, my low metabolism.  No, I'm lazy, and I eat shit, pretty much, the bottom line.  Yeah.  See, there you go.  So you could get rid of that if you just exercise a little bit, maybe eight smaller portions,  things like that, or a banana.  Jimmy's giving you a banana.  I eat a lot of fruit.  It helps.  That's good.  Well, I know.  You look really good.  Jimmy drops a lot of weight.  Yeah.  He did, right?  He did.  Yeah.  You look at his HBO special, and he's a lot heavier than he is now.  You look at me in January, I took a photo with Louie and Pamela on set, and Rick, and 
[04:10:00]  I'm fucking...  I can't believe how fat my neck is.  It's probably 20 pounds ago.  Yeah, 20 pounds.  Just eating a...  Yeah, sure.  No, I have...  The sad part is I have actually lost a lot of weight before.  I said, hey, why not just...  I'm going to guess right now you're going to weigh in at about 335.  I think higher.  Really?  Yeah, she's going to push...  Yeah, because I'm just dealing with the height.  I'm tall.  The height.  I'm going to put her at about 385.  No way.  I think he might be right.  I'm going to put about 385.  How tall are you?  You're tall.  5'10".  5'10". 
[04:10:30]  That's what I'm saying.  At least I have height.  That's all I got.  Both ways.  But now...  Are you pregnant?  I like how she's cock-locking.  No, I'm just fat.  It's the fat joke that comes after.  Pregnant?  Where's the scale?  Where is the scale?  Oh, my shit.  Can I say it again?  God damn, these motherfuckers.  Can I say it again?  You have a very lovely face.  Thank you.  You really do.  And she seems like a very nice girl.  You have a very sparkling personality.  They're nice in Houston.  Well, you guys are...  Texas girls.  Wait a minute.  Houston recently was voted the fattest city in the nation. 
[04:11:00]  Wasn't that the first thing you said when you were there?  Was that PH, though?  And I was sitting in the front row.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  Please don't look down.  Please don't look down.  Oh, I said that in my show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When I was in Houston that year when they won it, that was my opening joke.  And I was scared to death you were going to do something.  I was like, you guys have recently voted the fattest city in the country.  People kind of laughed.  They go, you fucking people ought to be a shamby assassin.  Yeah, but now that she's left, the average value to plus 50.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Is she with you?  Is that a friend?  That's my cousin.  That's your cousin?  Yeah. 
[04:11:30]  What happened?  Bring in sex change, Bill Burr.  That's what I was like.  No, what do you mean?  I shouldn't.  If I was good at science and I had a vagina.  You're very cute.  She's...  Hi, miss.  Hi, miss Susan.  Is that your boyfriend?  Yeah.  How long have you been dating?  Two and a half years.  Two and a half years?  Cousins.  Wait, cousins.  So...  22 years?  Where's the relationship?  Brothers?  Dads are brothers.  Dads are brothers.  Dads are brothers.  Oh, so...  So it was mom.  I used to own a pair. 
[04:12:00]  Mom had a little bit of weight.  I used to own a pair of corduroy's like that.  Did you?  She's been dying for this all day.  Huh?  Corduroy's.  Corduroy's.  Oh, that's cool.  So you're from Texas, too?  No, I'm from New Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  She's from New Jersey originally.  Oh.  I always wondered what the girl from the Blind Faith cover looked like today.  Oh, but wow, you are really going back.  Hey, that's real good.  That is going back.  I know.  I know.  I was like...  That's natural.  You're just your naturally red hair.  Second blind shape.  Yeah, obviously.  Not curly.  Wow.  And everything matches all over.  With hair like that, everything matches all over. 
[04:12:30]  Yeah.  Believe me.  Everybody knows that one.  That's Simon.  He's the one that sent the message.  Who's this creep?  Jimmy's signing autographs and pictures, but he's...  If I knew you were here...  He just goes, who's that creep in the picture as he's signing it?  Here's the scale.  I realized it was me.  Thank God.  Now...  No, you don't have to, but we want to get to...  But if you don't want your face on the internet, we suggest you wear the mask.  Who's that extra for Crybaby?  I'm not scared.  All right, you're not scared.  Big Daddy Don Carlitz. 
[04:13:00]  I like this girl.  Big Daddy Don Carlitz.  You guys in town for the night or whatever?  Tomorrow's my last day.  All right.  What time are you leaving?  I leave at 5.30 tomorrow.  We're here for you.  In the morning?  At night.  So come by the show tomorrow.  I can't.  I don't know how to check.  CD 1.30.  Do you want to hold it?  What time does the CD 1.30 leave?  My friend's in town with me and she's pregnant, like stuck at the hotel, thrown up and horrible.  Yeah, that's good.  Hopefully fucking dustbustering something off the...  Hopefully stand with yourself and drop her out like a tank with a parachute. 
[04:13:30]  She now has 18 more years of parties to go to.  Look on the bright side.  All right.  Here we go.  She is stepping up on the scale.  You're all on the radio.  And we are getting a reading.  That's your 8.  The official number is...  I was close.  368.20.  I said 3.35.  I was off by 30.  You were off by 17.  You were right.  368.  You don't look 368.  All right.  That's a compliment.  That's a compliment.  You don't look 368.  What were you?  You lost some weight. 
[04:14:00]  You lost some weight.  I think it was like 379 or something.  I'm on the moon.  Wait.  Watch this work.  It's better than nothing.  No, I'm saying that's great.  Keep it up.  Thanks.  Can I come back when I'm done?  Yeah.  What's your goal weight?  Probably like...  If I could get to 220, I'd be happy.  A Buick list saber?  Yes, that's right.  Well, come find us in a retirement home in Florida.  No!  You need a year.  You certainly can come back when you're done.  I'm serious.  Make your goal like 160.  You don't have to do it just eventually. 
[04:14:30]  220?  Yeah.  I weigh 150.  Okay, so I can't...  There's no way.  How tall are you?  Okay, 165.  Why can't you?  5'7"?  In years.  It's a while, but why not?  It all depends on the legs.  You got skinny legs?  They're skinny.  Well, they're skinny.  Let me say.  I'll tell you what you should be.  Cousin has...  Yeah, her legs aren't like...  It's not that bad.  She's got fat legs.  180.  I've never actually seen legs cry before.  Yeah, you can get down to...  Ankles.  Oh, yeah.  Give me a hug.  I'm teasing you.  You can get down to 180.  Easy.  Easily.  You get down to 180.  Move to New York.  Yeah, seriously. 
[04:15:00]  Just be like anorexic.  You know, I would.  Yeah.  Usually, that's like not a good thing, but...  Bulimia would be good for you for a while.  It would be so...  It's the right stuff.  You know, if I eat what you guys eat, you guys eat so freaking healthy, it's insane.  We try.  It's insane.  It's hard to.  I know.  That's why it's...  Do people bring it to you?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I eat, but I'm not.  I eat a lot of salmon.  Like when you go out of town and stuff?  Well, Anthony has a chef.  Yeah, I eat fruit.  Yeah, in your mansion?  Yes, of course.  I order fruit instead of whole steak.  She makes a low-calorie salad for it, then he bangs her.  And he burns more calories. 
[04:15:30]  You are a mad person.  You thought I forgot about that.  Come on, man.  I'm a guy.  Jesus Christ, that setup is fucking hilarious.  Who'd you buy the car for?  Come on, tell the truth.  The chef.  You did.  All right, Jeremy from Cleveland.  She calls Anthony my boss, the mouthfucker.  Hey, what's up, the fucking boy?  Jesus Christ, Jeremy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Jeremy.  All right, say it again.  I was acknowledging Bill Burr's line about the C-130 when she asked what time her flight  leaves me, and he says, when's the C-130 takeoff?  That was priceless, Bill.  Good line. 
[04:16:00]  Nice military joke.  Well, he gave me the...  Oh, he's good.  Anthony gave me the reference.  It's all Anthony.  That's not right.  Nah.  He's a military.  I was like military plane, and Anthony's like, oh, it's a C-130.  It was built by Donald Douglas.  Overtime.  Wow, that's...  Yeah, we're definitely doing a bonus show there.  You were great.  You were great.  Thank you for coming.  Yeah, very good.  Thank you for coming in.  That's being a trooper.  Can I get a picture with you guys?  I think now I'll be there.  Beat it.  Beat it.  We really got to get all of this, you know.  Okay. 
[04:16:30]  We don't want evidence.  Yeah.  All right.  If you want a picture with us, start walking now to the corner of 57th and 7th, so we can  all be in it together.  Okay.  Big B.  Son of a bitch.  I suck.  You had a great day, though.  I blew it.  Can we edit out that joke?  I was gold today.  Teasing, of course.  Shut up, Derek.  What is that?  I'm little, Jimmy.  What do you weigh, Jimmy?  A 47.  A 47.  A 47.  A 47.  A 47.  A 47 less than me.  No, she was 167 with... 
[04:17:00]  I'm happy with that.  It's close.  Before or after you shoot a load.  You never went to go home and take a nice shit.  We got a 146.  I got a fucking pound of soupy logs brewing.  It's going to be awful.  Oh, I got fucking a tsunami brewing.  Well, I got greedy.  You're going to take a soup shit.  Nothing.  Bob, please.  You should have...  I should have said soupy.  After fucking...  After Tsunami Line died,  we should have just killed it,  but we kept going. 
[04:17:30]  I got a little Rich Foster now.  Let's get out of here.  We'll hit the fucking tune.  We'll all laugh on the way up.  Oh, what's the song again, Jimmy?  It's a little...  You're going to be a DJ.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  This is your favorite station.  Oh, you need a name, too.  Let's call you Coconut Willie.  Oh.  No, how about this?  Coconut Willie's a good radio name, though.  I know.  This is Coconut Willie from WCNT.  Songs for women. 
[04:18:00]  Songs to hit your wife by.  This is a little number by someone called Citizen Cope.  And...  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think?  Oh, uh...  I believe he's from New York.  Um...  I'm hearing somewhere else.  And this song is called Sideway. 
[04:18:30]  I think.  This sucks.  I like that.  Are we going to walk out?  No, I'm going to comment on how much this blows.  Yeah, I like this song.  This part blows.  It's been a rock.  It doesn't rock.  It's mellow.  Does it kick in ever?  Yeah, it's mellow.  All right, then it sucks.  What?  This sounds like my neighbor playing this song.  You know it ain't easy.  This guy's good.  For these stars to leave me. 
[04:19:00]  See you tomorrow.  There are no words to describe it  In French or in England  Cause diamonds, they fade  And flowers, they bloom  And I'm telling you  That these feelings won't go away  They've been knocking me sideways
