<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began without a pre-planned topic, briefly touching upon Jim Norton's observations of the previous night's WWE Raw.  Early calls attempted to check on the status of a segment featuring a 19-year-old virgin, delayed due to her menstrual cycle, but were frequently interrupted by technical difficulties.  A substantial portion of the show was dominated by the abysmal ratings in Washington, D.C., featuring multiple angry and profane audio clips from their General Manager, Ken Stevens.  Listeners from D.C. called in with varied reactions to the criticism, some defending, others criticizing the show.

The conversation then shifted to a controversy surrounding a planned FDNY statue commemorating the raising of the flag at Ground Zero, focusing on the change from an all-white depiction of firefighters to a more racially diverse one.  This generated heated debate among listeners and the hosts.

Another significant segment focused on the ongoing search for Osama bin Laden, with humorous speculation on his whereabouts and the legal complexities of his potential capture. A caller, B-Dog, voiced concerns about a Utah discovery.  This was followed by a discussion of a Las Vegas mogul's ex-wife suing for exorbitant child support, including funds for a pet rabbit, with the hosts using highly offensive language to express their displeasure.  Courtney Love's legal battles were also mentioned in similarly offensive terms.  The D.C. ratings disaster was revisited, prompting more calls from both supportive and critical listeners offering suggestions for improvement.  The show also included O.J. Simpson impersonations and a nationality-guessing game based on stereotypes.  A new contest, the "Naughty Nighty Contest," was announced, involving women in nightgowns at the studio.  A future Philadelphia broadcast was mentioned.

The "Naughty Nighty" contest was further discussed, including legal modifications.  Jason made a brief comment.  The hosts then compared their ratings unfavorably to a newer show, using derogatory terms.  A segment with Jackie Fine followed, filled with explicit sexual content, including a game guessing her favorite sexual position.  Her product, a female sexual enhancement cream, was heavily promoted.  Technical difficulties briefly interrupted this segment.

Following this, the hosts discussed Sam Adams beer commercials, their perceived outrageousness, and potential bans. Listener feedback and a "blow me" line were briefly mentioned.  Phone numbers for calls were provided.  The show concluded with further discussion of the poor D.C. ratings, controversial opinions on the treatment of Guantanamo Bay detainees, and a *Time* Magazine article quote they considered inaccurate and damaging.  An upcoming *Details* Magazine article about men's underwear and their reaction to a Calvin Klein ad were also discussed. A listener named Megan contributed to a "six o'clock queef" segment.  Throughout this, offensive language, product promotion, and sexually explicit conversations were prevalent.


A *Details* Magazine interview about penis size was discussed, followed by graphic descriptions and comparisons of the hosts' and others' genitals, including a roommate's penis and photos.  The "What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show Today?" segment followed, featuring callers with humorous, crude, and sexually suggestive insights, often focusing on the D.C. ratings, Jackie Fine, and sexually explicit jokes about the hosts.  The show concluded with plugs for the "Naughty Nighty" contest and a Bar 9 appearance, reiterating the poor D.C. ratings.

[00:06:30]  49, my friend  It's always good when we do well with men 18 to 34 as well, which we seem to be doing  Uh, our ultimate goal sure is to be, uh, you know, number one with women as well, but that's never gonna happen  It's never gonna happen  Yeah, let's be real  Alright  We can only soften our delivery so much before we sacrifice what we know what to do  Right  Alright, I understand  Listen, the other thing I wanna tell you is, uh, if you can get to the date which lost about a year and a half ago

Last name on the air, by the way  Hey, alright, let's just get it over with like a shout-out yeller, tell us how you did in Washington  In Washington  In where?  Come on, like a band-aid, rip it off, let's go  Where, uh, where, where  Did your Seattle ratings come in?  You mean, you mean, you mean, you mean, you mean we're on in Washington?  Apparently not 
[00:07:30]  Alright guys, bye-bye  Well, um, damn, I couldn't hang up on him fast enough  Well, there's quotes, I know that  Well, I know some, some quotes were made by, um, by, um, one of the people, our own general manager  Of this station and of this station in Washington, WJFK  Well, it's Ken Stevens, Super GM  Ken Stevens, yes  Who's, uh, pretty much the GM of a lot of the radio stations we broadcast to these days  And when the ratings came out, he, um, he had a quote today for, uh, our ratings in Afternoon Drive at JFK 
[00:08:00]  This is an exact quote from Ken Stevens  Alright  Who is the GM here in New York  He's also the GM in Philadelphia  Uh-huh  He's also the GM in, uh, Washington  Alright  Have we told everyone that we're doing really well in New York and Philly and Austin and Cleveland?  Oh  Like that matters  To Washington  But  Just when you thought your pals Opie and Anthony were gonna get big heads  I knew  You start driving around in limos and stuff  I knew a humbling experience was in the cards somewhere 
[00:08:30]  This keeps us real  Yeah  Keeping us real  Well, here's the, uh, the exact quote from Ken Stevens  Uh, as far as our ratings go in Washington, D.C.  Give us the quote  On that fine radio station, WJFK  Give us the quote  Ken Stevens, and I quote  This is no lie  Alright  I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster  Just in case you didn't hear that 
[00:09:00]  Maybe, maybe, uh, maybe a siren was going by  Uh-huh  And your radio crapped out  Ken Stevens, general manager of WJFK in Washington  This is, uh, him talking about our ratings  Uh-huh  Not the station's ratings, just you and I  Right  Because we're the only show that, that sucked  Uh-huh  In Washington  I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster  Yeah, but what did he, what did he mean by that?  Well, you can interpret it in many ways, Anthony  I can interpret that in God, in the ones of ways 
[00:09:30]  I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster  I could take the word bigger and  Disaster  Disaster has so many ways it can be interpreted  You know, this is, this is how bad it is, okay?  Yeah  Ken, um, is pretty close to Ant and I  You know, we, we discussed the show and this and that  Not quite chums  Well, but as far as management goes, he's not a bad guy 
[00:10:00]  Right?  Chums  Yeah  He didn't have time to talk to Ant and I today  No, no  He's, uh, he's pretty much in, uh, in meetings behind closed doors  And the best I could get out of him  Usually we'll go over the ratings  Hey, excuse me, you're doing great in this demo  You're doing bad in this demo  This needs a little work  This is good, this is promising  The only thing he could give me today was  I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster and he hung up on us  Yeah  That is all we've gotten from, uh, Super GM Ken Stevens today 
[00:10:30]  That's pretty much it  Um, so then, you know, we were like, well, what do you mean by that?  What do you mean?  So then we had to call other program directors and stuff to get the actual ratings  There is  Now I don't care, if you're in Washington right now and you're listening to the show  Hi  Hi, guy  How you doing?  How are ya?  Because, according to the ratings, Opie, from what I see 
[00:11:00]  No one is listening to this show in Washington  Uh, well, they're, they're, sure they're listening  Are they?  Yeah, more people have fled this show than Kabul  Yeah  Let's just put it this way, when the Titanic was sinking  I'm sure there was a radio playing and people were listening  Yeah  But then came a, came a point where they had to swim for their lives  Freezing with the icy waters of the North Pole  We all saw the movie, that little band was playing  I'm sure people were enjoying the tunes  And then realized, wait a minute 
[00:11:30]  It's time to go  Yeah  Yeah  Uh, so with that said, uh, well, um, your, your pals  Yeah  Opie and Anthony  Not your pals in Washington  Uh, well, well, last book  Yeah  Which we kinda shared with, uh, Don and Mike  So it wasn't even really our book  Right, Don and Mike had, had the afternoon show 
[00:12:00]  In, uh, D.C. on JFK for, for many years  Many years  Ten years  And, uh, were number one  They were number one  Number one  And then last, uh, ratings period  Which was three months ago  We shared the ratings  Yeah  This time slot  We had their more gooder ratings  And our-  And our more badder ratings  Less gooder, sure  Much less gooder ratings  Well, no, at that time it was less gooder  Horrendously less gooder ratings  So, we dragged it down to fourth place  Last book  Yeah  This ratings period is all you and I, Ant 
[00:12:30]  It's the first book that includes  Just you and I  Just us  So, we went from, uh, fourth place  Yeah  To, uh, 16th place  To what?  16th  What? 6th?  16th  16th?  16th  16th place  This was a number one slot  I want to be fully embarrassed today  I need to know some of the stations now beating us in Washington 
[00:13:00]  Ooh  Do they play twofers?  I'm sure the twofer stations beating us  How many stations could there be?  Do they speak English?  I'm sure there are some foreign language stations beating us  Yeah, we went from, uh, fourth to 16th  Horrible 16th  There's no one listening  We have chased everyone away from the afternoon drive slot at WJFK  Yeah  If you're listening right now, it's an accident  Yeah  Something happened  You were tuning in something else 
[00:13:30]  Uh, Anthony, we have, um, um, you know, Ken's not talking to us about the ratings in Washington  But he's talking to the media about the LNA show  Uh-oh  Would you like to hear a clip?  Uh, yeah, this is Ken  I thought it was horrible, disgusting, embarrassing, shameful  It's stuck  Wow  He was just getting warmed up though  He has, uh, a little more to say to the media about the O.P. and Anthony show  We just got our ass totally kicked

We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  866-2774.  Wow.  Norton has left the building. 
[00:27:00]  He's so distraught.  Yeah.  He just got up and left.  Where is he?  We got really bad news today.  Oh, there's Jim.  Um, we're now in 16th place in Washington, D.C.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the ratings.  And I was wondering, uh, about, uh, you know, the stations that are beating us, Anthony.  I got a list of all the stations beating us. 
[00:27:30]  It's two pages, by the way.  Uh-huh.  It gets even worse.  We're tied for 16th place in the ratings.  Right.  With three other stations.  So that's like beating, like, 20th place.  Yeah.  Oh, exactly.  We're tied for 16th place with three other stations.  Here are just some of the stations that are beating us, Anthony.  Uh, a classic rock station's beating us.  Uh-huh.  Top 40's beating us.  A country, a country station. 
[00:28:00]  Country.  A country station's beating us.  Country.  Urban Contemporary's beating us.  Uh-huh.  That's black music for old folk, by the way.  Uh, News Talk is beating us.  The Rock Station's beating us.  Uh-huh.  The Oldies Station is beating us.  The Oldies.  Another urban contemporary station is beating us.  So two of them.  Two.  Right.  Stations that play black music for old folk.  They could divvy up the audience and still beat us.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, a Hot AC station is beating us. 
[00:28:30]  The News Station is beating us.  Uh-huh.  The Jazz Station is beating us.  Jazz.  The Classical Station is beating us.  That means people would rather hear Mozart than us.  Mozart.  Uh.  An Adult Contemporary Station is beating us, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  And two hip-hop stations are beating us.  Uh-huh.  Let's see it.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha.  Paul from Center H.  Who won the unlucky lottery today?  The guys who have to suffer through your lead-in at JFK at 7? 
[00:29:00]  Ha-ha-ha.  Nice.  Hey, join the friggin' club.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  All right.  Let's move on with the radio show.  Bill, you're next to the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hey, listen.  I, um, found out a little news today.  Uh, kind of disturbed about it.  I found out that that memorial that they're going to build, uh, they're taking two white 
[00:29:30]  guys out and putting, uh, I guess an Hispanic and a black guy in?  Yeah.  Does that sound right?  Uh, yeah, that's what they're doing.  Yeah, a lot of people are outraged here in New York, especially, and, uh, they're going  to still do it.  They don't give a flying F what everyone thinks.  I think that's pretty disturbing, actually.  I was, I was trying to, I drove up from Philadelphia to Boston, from Boston back to Philadelphia,  thinking about something to myself.  What happens?  I have a four-year-old daughter.  I walk up, and, uh, just a part of history.  She says, Dad, who are these three guys, you know, raising the flag here? 
[00:30:00]  And I go, well, this one guy was, you know, part of what happened, and the other two guys  had nothing to do with it.  They had to throw me because of, uh, because of, you know, everybody thinks it's racist.  Revisionist history, to be politically correct.  What are we doing, uh, I don't mean to talk over you, but, I mean, what are we doing?  Just changing history?  Why don't we take the Statue of Emajima to raise the flag there?  Yeah.  Put a few black guys, Spanish guys in.  I don't understand, guys.  Listen, I'm not racist by any means.  No, Bill, you don't have to make excuses or explain yourself.  This is how you feel, and a lot of people feel the same way.  This is the story.  Just get everyone on the same page. 
[00:30:30]  That famous picture of the three firemen, uh, raising the flag down at, uh, Ground Zero,  I think it was, like, the day after, right?  Yeah.  I mean, that, that, that, that picture has been, uh, you know, everywhere at this point.  They're now making, uh, they're now making a statue based on that picture.  Yep.  Uh, it's obvious to everyone that the three guys in the, in the picture are all white guys,  but, uh, the fire department has decided that they need to make one of the guys a black guy,  one of the guys a Hispanic guy, and one of the guys a white guy, which basically means  let's change history. 
[00:31:00]  Absolutely.  Now, here's, it's, it's so obvious what should be done here.  If that's how the fire department feels, and they want, they want to have a statue, so we  all remember the, you know, the firemen that, uh, were lost, uh, on that day, then come  up with something else.  I figure another picture, you have to have more than just that one picture, but it actually  kind of depicted the, uh, the mood of the country at the time, and now you just, you  just, you just can't change it.  Bill, Bill.  It's a crazy issue.  It's insane.  It's, it's very simple.  I mean, we have a lot of artists in New York.  They could come up with another sculpture that represents what happened on 9-11 with the 
[00:31:30]  firemen, but when you, uh, when you take a picture and try to change history, that is  just dead wrong, man.  It should not be done.  You know, if you, if you, if you're so passionate about what happened at there, I mean, believe  it or not, I'm kind of a bike type of guy.  I got, from my, my right wrist up to my elbow, I have a big cross with a, uh, flag kind of  torn, it's tattooed.  Right.  The flag kind of drapes over the cross, and it has WTC, and it has the date, and it says,  in God, we trust, we're very passionate, I'm an honorable, uh, discharged Marine, so 
[00:32:00]  I fought with black men.  I've done all these things, and just, you know, I just, I think that there's a lot of  black men, as well as Hispanics, who probably feel the same way as I do.  It should be the way that it is.  Race shouldn't even come into it.  It should be.  If you want to make a statue based on a historic moment, you make a statue based on that moment,  and, uh, you, you don't change it for, for, for politically correct, for political correctness.  You don't. 
[00:32:30]  Like Ope said, you want to make a statue that, uh, depicts the, uh, um, diversity of the  fire department?  Great.  Just make something up.  Yeah.  Or take a picture where, yeah, you see, uh, ethnic diversity at work, and you work off  of that.  You don't take a picture and make it into a sculpture and then change it for political correctness  that's ridiculous.  I don't know if I agree with you, man, and I hate PC.  I, I really don't.  Stop it.  No, man, I don't know.  Well, all right, let me hear a valid point on this as, to why they should, uh, change the 
[00:33:00]  participants of that flag raising.  I, it's not that I think history shouldn't be changed, and I'm not for being politically  correct.  I just think when, when anything is memorialized, because we were all raised a point before,  he said that one of the guys who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, I think he said was, was  Indian, American Indian, whatever, and they changed it.  Um, and I don't think anything should be changed.  Well, that's wrong, too.  I agree.  But I don't think anything should be changed to be politically correct.  It's just whenever you're, you're, you're going to, like, have a symbol of something  or representing something, I don't think it's as important, and if that makes people feel 
[00:33:30]  better than do, who cares?  But then, but then they shouldn't base it on that moment.  That moment, uh, was, uh, I'm sorry, it was a very real moment.  It was not, uh.  That, in this case, was three white guys.  I just liked it because, you know something, we're always getting slammed by people that,  that are calling us, uh, uh, racist names and whatnot.  But the bottom line, if, and, and honestly, consider this, if it was, in fact, uh, three 
[00:34:00]  black guys or three Hispanic guys that raised that flag, um, on that day, and then there  was a sculpture made, and they went and said, look, instead of the three black guys, we're  going to make one a white guy and one a Hispanic guy, you would have every black leader screaming  bloody murder, that they should not change that, that it should be the original three  black men, and you know something, they would win that argument.  And you're right.  Because you'd get people that would just bend over and take it. 
[00:34:30]  And you don't even try to tell me that that wouldn't, uh, uh, get people up in arms.  If it was three black guys that raised that flag, or three Hispanic guys, and you told  them, hey, make one of them a white guy.  Hell no, it was three black guys, and that's how that statue's got to be made.  With us, though, it's like, the second you mention, hey, maybe it should be three white  guys, because that's who raised it, ah, you're a goddamn racist.  No, it's a realist.  It's the way it happened. 
[00:35:00]  If they want to depict that scene accurately, historically, it should be a, uh, uh, sculpture  of the three men that did it.  Well, now this guy's pissed at us.  I think it's a black and white issue.  It's obvious what they should do.  I don't know, man.  Come on, another sculpture.  I have no problem with, you know.  You're correct.  It's not going to be exactly as it happened, and I don't think it's for politically correct  reasons.  I really think it's just to represent firemen that way.  I don't know.  I just don't have a problem with it.  Normally, I would.  Represent the firemen in another way. 
[00:35:30]  I'm all for representing, uh, the black firemen, the Hispanic firemen, and the white firemen  that lost their lives on, on 9-11.  But don't change history.  But you can't get a-  That's dangerous.  You can't get a better moment than that.  You just can't.  Yes, you can.  Well, you know something?  We got some creative artists in New York that could come up with something else.  You can't get a better moment.  You know something?  That's a, that's-  Ah.  Will, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Like Norton said, man, it was, it wasn't only white people that died in that thing.  It was black firemen.  It was Hispanic firemen, Hispanic policemen, Hispanic, uh, I mean, black policemen. 
[00:36:00]  Absolutely.  That's why they're doing it.  We all know that.  But then take a moment that included, uh, people of, of every race and make that a statue.  Or just come up with something.  Just come up with something like they did at the, uh, the Vietnam Memorial.  Right.  The wall, the three soldiers, uh, walking out, holding each other, uh, that, that wasn't  taken from a picture.  It was a very diverse scene.  And, and that's how it's, uh, uh, presented in Washington.  Okay, but the point is-  By the way, who doesn't listen to the show, Washington.  Um-  The point is, I mean, I can't help the way that picture came out. 
[00:36:30]  The picture was great.  I mean, two, three firemen raising the flag.  I mean, you couldn't-  Right, you can't help the way it came out.  That's how it was done.  That's not, that's a, that's a moment in history.  Okay, so why can't you leave it at black and Hispanic and a white dude to represent everybody?  Because it didn't happen to be a piece about it.  Because it didn't happen that way.  It's three white guys.  That's not the point.  In this case.  Yes, it is the point.  It is.  It is absolutely the point.  We all got hurt.  You got hurt.  Then come up with another statue.  Maybe the black person down the block got hurt.  We all got hurt.  So make a different memorial that does not depict a historic photograph. 
[00:37:00]  Then make something different.  That's all we're saying.  Make something different.  Don't use this picture because it's not represented the right way.  Have a statue of a fire truck and firemen sitting there with their heads bowed in sorrow.  There.  That's a great memorial.  I've seen that picture and seen many ethnic, people of ethnic backgrounds in pictures like that.  You can't take a historic photo and change it to be politically correct. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  You win, damn it.  We're not trying to win.  I'm just amazed that people like Norton especially.  I know.  There isn't even a need to be acting like this because, I mean, it was a tragedy regardless.  I mean, I don't even know why it should be anything about political from the start.  Yeah, I have nothing to do with political correctness.  Believe me.  I'm not even.  I don't even want to.  I mean, yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I don't even want to bring that into it.  I'm just saying as simple as this.  You should not change history. 
[00:38:00]  And if it just happened to be two black guys and a white guy and they wanted to change one of the black guys to a Hispanic guy, I'd be just as outraged.  Would you?  Yes, idiot!  I'm making sure I knew you.  Don't be yelling at me.  I know you.  But of course I would.  I know you.  I know you and I know Anthony.  I'll be changing your minds every other minute.  No, we're not.  Yes, we do.  Of course I would.  That's what pisses me.  This isn't about racism or anything like that.  It's about changing history.  Right.  I actually think that the memorial should do this. 
[00:38:30]  I agree.  I agree they should come up with a memorial.  And if they don't want to have a statue of the three white guys that is just like the picture, then come up with something else.  That's all I'm saying.  That is all I'm saying.  Tim solves the entire problem on Line 5 of the National.  Thanks, Will.  My God.  Why didn't we think of this?  Tim.  Hey.  What's your solution?  Okay.  First of all, I have one quick comment.  Is the Statue of Liberty cross-dressing transvestite then?  Second of all, make them green.  Just like the Statue of Liberty cross-dressing transvestite. 
[00:39:00]  Everyone's green.  All right.  I like it.  Green.  That's funny.  The statue they had.  You see the statue they were bringing through the city with the guy.  It was like one fireman who was on his knees.  To me, that was the best thing you could do for a memorial.  Yeah.  That was great.  You can't change it, though, for political correctness.  You can't.  I agree with you, but I got no problem with them doing this.  I don't know why.  I normally wouldn't.  I think it's odd, and I just don't like...  I really think it's odd that you have no problem with it, too.  I know. 
[00:39:30]  Seriously.  Normally, I would, but...  It's history.  It's done purely to be politically correct.  Purely.  There is no other reason that it's being done like that.  I don't know, man.  And I'm not saying it's...  You might be right, but it could be...  The Times, like, political correctness could be confused with somebody who's saying,  let's just do something that represents everybody that was killed.  And it might not be for PC reasons.  It might not be like, let's pander.  I don't have a problem with that.  Don't use that phone.  It was a great moment.  I don't have a problem with it.  And if you want to depict it in a sculpture, it should be done the way it was done in history. 
[00:40:00]  You know, maybe they put that statue, and years from now, someone's going to do a study  on a report.  You know, hey, I saw this statue.  It was fantastic.  And I want to look at the history of it and find out who these three guys were and see  what happened to them.  And all of a sudden, you're like, what?  That was like, you know, Michael McMurphy?  Hey, he's a black guy.  It doesn't...  I don't like the idea that they're changing history like that to be politically correct. 
[00:40:30]  I also don't care about some douchebag in 50 years doing a book report.  Well, all right.  I understand your point.  I don't either tell you the truth.  What am I saying?  He was making a bad...  He was trying to make a stupid point.  All right.  We could argue this all day, obviously, but I think it's so freaking obvious.  Just come up with another statue.  Right.  That's all?  That's what you want to do?  Cool.  I'm all for it.  Just come up with another statue. 
[00:41:00]  Fuck.  Yeah, well.  All right.  Let me go from that to Doug from Springfield.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, Doug?  I just heard off the AP that the Southern guy from Washington is coming up and joining your  show to try and improve ratings, just like Michael Jordan came back with the Wizards.  Well...  Is that it?  You know what?  After we take a break, we'll get the Southern guy on the phone, see what he thinks.  Hey, what's the matter with you boys?  You'll be out the door real quick. 
[00:41:30]  I don't care.  I told you I want you on board.  A pussah!  All right, we'll talk to our Southern boss next.  How's that, all right?  Southern guy and George.  I have an excuse to bring back Southern boss.  We stink.  We stink.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  The whole bit.  Yeah.  Another guy that thinks the statue's all right.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, Washington listener here, so I probably don't know a lot.  But the statue's okay.  Oh.  You know, it symbolizes who died and what happened. 
[00:42:00]  You know, everybody's in there.  If it's only going to be one statue, it's fair to represent the different races of the  people whose blood was shed in there and smashed together.  Oh, my God.  I agree with you.  But then just make another statue.  Why do you need to take that picture and change it?  Well, that's what they want.  I agree.  If you're going to make a memorial, everyone should be represented.  But then just come up with something completely different.  Yeah.  You got a good point.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.  We could probably sit here and think of 20 different statues within five minutes that 
[00:42:30]  would work just as well.  Yeah, but it's a good idea for a statue.  It's going along with Iwo Jima.  I completely agree to, you know, represent everyone.  I have no problem with that.  Just come up.  I'm saying it over and over again.  Don't forget the Virginia listeners.  Come up with another freaking statue.  Thank you, Bob.  Hey, don't forget the Virginia listeners.  Washington's a small part.  Virginia's real big.  Hi, Virginia.  All right.  Have a good one.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  We love you down here.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  This guy has the perfect solution.  Then we'll move on.  Last call on this.  David, what's up?  Hey, I got the perfect solution for the statue.  Yeah.  You keep the picture.  You keep the statue just like the picture.  And you put a couple of hubcaps and a bucket of chicken there.  All right.  Thank you.  Great.  That was good.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Where's Stinky?  He's screaming that call.  Stinky just hung us out to dry.  Stinky, what happened?  You're an ass knife. 
[00:43:30]  Who answered that phone?  I did.  And did I finish writing what was on there?  The front, the top line goes, guy has perfect solution.  We go to the phone and then all of a sudden he writes on the third line, no, with like  12 O's.  As the guy's talking.  No, and then in parentheses, racist.  Then why would you ever put him through?  Because you could have set it up maybe differently then if you knew it.  I don't know.  That was hilarious how that went down because all of a sudden, no, with 12 O's.  Oh, boy. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Let's take a break and regroup.  What are you laughing at?  Jesus, man.  You saw that go down, right, Ant?  Yeah.  I saw it.  Andy's talking.  We went with it thinking.  He's typing.  No.  We went with it thinking, okay, this will wrap up this fine little segment nicely.  Perfect solution.  Come on.  That's how you end the bit, right?  Perfect solution.  Uh-huh.  And we go to him and all of a sudden.  No.  It was like in slow motion. 
[00:44:30]  He's typing it.  So we're watching all the O's being added to the screen.  Boy, I saw like at first N, O.  So then I'm quickly thinking, well, he's going to say something like not a bad idea.  But then it was more O's.  I'm like, uh-oh.  All right.  Hung us out to dry today.  You suck.  You know what that's like?  It's like that Regan bit.  With all that pot you're smoking, your reflexes are slowing down.  It's like that Regan bit when he asks a fat lady, when's the baby do? 
[00:45:00]  When's the baby do, baby?  Stop it in time.  All right.  We got the latest on John Walker next.  We're quoted in the latest issue of Details Magazine.  We're doing the Ethnicity Game today.  Ethnicity.  Ethnicity Game today.  Oof.  Ooh.  Oh, yeah.  And we'll come back with a fine new segment on the show called It's the Bitches.  It's the bitches that are gitches.  That are gitches. 
[00:45:30]  Something strange is happening here.  Fuck.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guess what's in teen pants.  Yeah, you're checking out the O and A show.  Just tuning in with much less gooder in Washington.  I think we are the worst gooder out of anywhere that we broadcast to. 
[00:46:00]  The worst less gooder.  We already have ass wipes all over message boards going,  How long will this disaster last before they pull the plug?  Opie and Anthony always get the last laugh.  Stay tuned.  Don't you worry about it.  Here's something that's going to piss off a lot of people.  Thank you, Jeff, from Cleveland.  Cleveland, where we're doing more gooder. 
[00:46:30]  Thank you, Cleveland.  Yeah.  Jeff writes, Anthony, this one is going to get you going.  Fox News is reporting that the American Taliban, John Walker,  is going to be charged with aiding terrorism  and will only get a possible 10 to 15 years, no death.  He may get life in prison if they can prove that he has something to do  with the CIA guy that was killed, no possibility of death.  And he's going to be tried in a civilian court.  This is BS.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  Wah. 
[00:47:00]  Wah.  Haven't they never put a traitor to death in this country?  I've heard that somewhere, that a traitor has never been put to death.  Why can't they try him as a traitor?  The guy was shooting at people.  He could have been directly responsible for the deaths of those CIA guys.  Oh, brother.  We're doomed.  There you go.  We're just doomed. 
[00:47:30]  Ooh, the terrorists are going to be scared of the ugly Americans now.  Ooh.  We're so scary.  Oh, yeah, great.  Is that the Inquirer?  Has his little kid's school pictures in there?  We didn't get that story from the Inquirer.  Crinkle, crinkle.  We have a second picture.  We do have better news stories, Anthony.  But they do have pretty pictures in the Inquirer.  Heck no, he shouldn't be put to death.  Look at this shot.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:48:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, here's Tim.  Yep.  Tim, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Calling from Washington.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  How you doing?  Hey, there's three of us listening.  Three?  I think we're like two.  I know, because there's three of us in the shop, and we got two radios playing, so you  have technically two.  We were hoping we had more than three people listening.  Well, I would hope so.  We're listening, though.  What's up?  Hey, man. 
[00:48:30]  What's going on?  Not much.  We're listening, though.  All right.  Show eight.  Your show still sucks best.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  You know what's going to happen to this Taliban guy?  He's going to get, whatever, ten years.  Great.  He'll be out in five, and then he's going to end up exactly like Patty Hearst.  Patty Hearst was taken hostage.  He's going to be on the dais when they roast somebody?  Exactly. 
[00:49:00]  That's my point.  Patty Hearst was, in fact, a terrorist back in the day.  She was a member of a terrorist organization that, just because they were inept and couldn't  get bombs to work, doesn't mean they weren't planting them in cop cars and whatnot.  And some people would say that Patty Hearst was brainwashed.  Yeah.  Brainwashed.  And she didn't know what she was doing.  And you don't think this guy's going to cop the same effing plea?  I'm just telling you what other people would say.  I hear they're going to add John Walker's image to the statue as one of the firemen. 
[00:49:30]  You know, just like Patty Hearst, though, she did her jail time.  She gets out, and what did she say?  Yeah, I was brainwashed, man.  Oh, boy, was I effed up.  Where do I sign for my book deal and my movie deal and my talk shows?  And how do I get on the dais of Hugh Hefner's roast at the Friars Club?  And when is Barbara Walters going to be calling me for the exclusive interview?  Where's my interview so I can make people in the audience go,  aww, when I talk about how horrible I was abused and how, uh, 
[00:50:00]  we're so doomed as a nation.  We're a bunch of pussies.  That this guy is going to serve minimal time, get out,  and become a wealthy man on American money.  After he does that.  You know what, though?  Someone will put a bullet in his head.  No, you know what?  I'd love to believe that, and I love to think that when it happens.  But you see, you always talk about,  oh, you know, the guy that kills a kid or something like that and goes to prison. 
[00:50:30]  You're like, oh, that guy's effed.  That guy's dead.  They put him in protective custody.  The worst that happens, maybe he gets thrown a beating.  Jeffrey Dahmer is the only guy I ever hear about  that actually got his brains handed to him in prison.  And that was for cutting somebody online.  Right.  That wasn't even for what he did.  Hey, I can understand you eating people's brains,  but don't you cut me in line.  I'm going to put a ball-beat hammer to your head.  Yeah.  I yelled next.  Yeah, whack.  Well, do you blame the guy?  Cutting in line?  He could be adding something to the trays. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Hey, this isn't Swedish meatballs.  Hey, that's my hot dog with a helmet on it.  I'll blame the guy who's in prison.  I'd be a little paranoid if Dahmer was in front of me for lunch.  This guy's going to get wealthy.  This isn't baked scrod.  Oh.  Scrodum.  It's scrodum.  It's people who just, you know, they look at him and,  oh, I have empathy for him.  Yeah.  Poor misguided. 
[00:51:30]  They can't believe a suburban white kid can be such a little disgusting bag of jokes.  Right.  Because it's a reflection on them.  Well, guess what?  He is and you are.  Exactly.  Scumbag.  Brother Joe, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  It's kind of a related subject, but what really disgusts me was an article that I read today,  a paper about a Taliban leader that was sitting there chatting with a leader of the Northern  Alliance.  And the leader of one of these generals, the Northern Alliance, they said, oh, yeah, two 
[00:52:00]  weeks ago or two months ago, we were trying to kill each other.  But it was never personal.  Yeah.  They're buddy-buddy now.  Oh, this is why it's, this is why the entire, I mean, you know, God bless America, but the  entire action over there is, you know, as far as I'm concerned, it's really turning  out the deeper north.  Yeah.  Don't, don't even think for a second that the people that were fighting on our side over  there in Afghanistan care a crap about the United States.  Oh, they're going to remain loyal to any type of coalition over there? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  That interim government they set up is nothing.  It will be overthrown by another dictatorship like the Taliban, because that's what those  animals enjoy over there.  They love being a conquered, defeated flock of sheep to power hungry criminals that will  once again, take them into stadiums for showing some skin and cut their feet off because they're  animals and they know nothing better.  Yeah.  Well, it was kind of related.  I figured I'd call it.  I'm on my way in, guys. 
[00:53:00]  I'll see you in a few.  All right.  Come on.  Got to separate from other.  I'd tell you, Buchanan's nuts, but he was right about that.  Close the borders.  The countries we should be involved with are Israel and England and maybe a couple others  and the rest of them.  Fend for yourself.  Don't touch the oil.  And that's all we care about.  The problem is we're trying to relate to them and trying to believe they can relate to  us on the same level, the same level of thinking, the same moral level, the same belief level.  It's never going to work.  They are of a completely different animal than we are. 
[00:53:30]  And they feel the same way about us.  Fine.  Don't deal with them.  Deal with industrialized countries that don't live in rock piles with a hole in it for a door.  And we'll be a lot better off.  Another thing before we move on.  Stop making believe, you know, you have an idea where Osama bin Laden is.  Yeah.  We have no effing clue.  No.  So stop.  Every day in the papers, well, we think he's in Utah. 
[00:54:00]  Today, they think he might be in Utah.  He might be in Utah.  Because they've never seen an Arab.  Anybody who's not completely white, they're like, it's him.  Stupid.  I mean, the Utah story is not that serious.  There's actually people in Utah that think that he's in Utah.  Is Osama bin Laden hiding in Utah?  Well, we really don't know where he is.  And we're making believe we have an idea.  And it's just a matter of time.  They've been saying that for, what, four months now?  We have no effing clue.  Opie, there's been a bunch of bin Laden sightings in Utah. 
[00:54:30]  Could you imagine if he really was?  Well, yeah, Utah, whatever.  Salt Lake City Police, Charles Isley.  Oh, it's off the AP, though, Ann.  It's got to be true.  Isn't ruling out the possibility.  We have checked every cave in town and turned up nothing.  The cave.  They're checking caves in Utah for bin Laden.  Jesus Christ.  I think if we lost our mind.  I think if we lost our mind.  Was in Utah, he'd get a brownstone or something.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Perhaps he doesn't have to live in one of the caves out there.  We're checking the caves.  That's exactly where I went, though.  When I went to Utah, I went out in that high desert with the caves and the balancing rocks that I told you about and everything.  And I'm looking around going, you know, this is a lot smaller than Afghanistan.  And you could hide someone anywhere in that desert and they would never find him.  Never?  Never.  If Osama bin Laden was hiding in the Utah desert, you'd still never find him.  And he was hiding in Afghanistan, which is caves and mountains a lot bigger than that. 
[00:55:30]  And he got away.  Somehow he got away.  And they're saying by sea, Hopi.  Saying he was on a boat somewhere.  He hopped on a princess cruise.  And he's boogieing down to the electric slide in the ballroom.  He's probably watching some hack comic right now on a ship.  Do Iggy impressions.  Hi.  Want to buy a dryer door?  We should list all the places he supposedly is.  We have no clue.  No one knows. 
[00:56:00]  Because we, as a society, need to feel like we're closing in and we're going to have him soon.  They don't know where he is.  And it's freaking people out in Washington.  Oh, that's why.  American Taliban.  Shut up.  Let's go to B-Dog.  Yo, B-Dog.  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  What up?  What's up, Norton?  How you doing?  Hello, sir.  Yeah, a few things real quick.  Number one, if Anthony's right, we are doomed.  Because if we find Osama bin Laden in Utah, we are just screwed beyond all recognition. 
[00:56:30]  Number two, I want to send a F you to every person down here in D.C. who is not listening to your show.  All right.  Except for me.  They didn't hear it.  Yeah, they're not hearing this.  Yeah, well, screw them.  So what?  There's naked chicks.  There's a lot of debauchery.  You know what?  That's not a bad thing.  You know what I'm saying?  Hey, B-Dog, if a tree falls in the woods, but...  Never mind.  Ah, forget it.  All right, B-Dog.  Thank you.  See you.  Well, it's not their brand of comedy. 
[00:57:00]  Their brand.  Not like a certain brand of comedy, mister.  Kellogg's brand comedy.  Oh, elbow on the ribs, you'll...  I'll tell you something else, too.  We find Osama bin Laden, we're not killing him.  No.  That guy will be put on trial.  There's no way we're killing Osama bin Laden and we find him.  Wouldn't die.  The only reason...  I just hope a Marine is smart enough to put a bullet in his head and go, I don't know,  this is how we found him.  You've got to torture him and get information.  You've got to torture him.  Do you know the only reason that the guy that blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City... 
[00:57:30]  What the hell's his name there?  Timothy McVeigh.  Timothy McVeigh was killed is because he wanted to die.  That guy would have been fine.  They'd have exhausted all the appeals.  It would have taken years.  And somehow, someway, they'd have found some reason why the trial was a farce and evidence was bad.  And he wouldn't have been put to death.  It happened so quickly in that case, relatively speaking quickly.  Because he said, look, all right, kill me.  Fine.  I'll be a martyr.  But someone like bin Laden, it would take... 
[00:58:00]  Oh, how could you really prove that he was responsible for the World Trade Center?  We're doomed.  We don't have balls.  We don't have balls in this country to stand up and say, F you.  F you and your people.  We're killing this guy.  Jim.  Hey.  What's up?  Actually, the reason why they went after him, they could have went after John Walker a lot of ways.  The reason they didn't go after him as far as the traitor was concerned is because the burden of proof for a traitor...  It's actually in the Constitution, apparently.  The burden of proof for a traitor is huge. 
[00:58:30]  You've got to feel like three witnesses that saw you be a traitor.  So how are you going to get them under those circumstances?  Hey, I could count to three.  All the witnesses are buried in a cave somewhere.  How come they change all the other goddamn laws in the Constitution that are supposed to be that,  but they can't flip that one around a little bit?  How about if you're from California and you're found in Afghanistan with a beard?  You're guilty.  You don't need three witnesses to kill someone.  I mean, you need a burden of proof.  Somehow it's easy for them to rewrite things to take away your freedom to assemble, your freedom of speech. 
[00:59:00]  They've taken that.  They've chiseled that away.  Your right to bear arms.  They've decimated that part of the Constitution.  Yet, for a traitor, that still stands?  Oh, brother.  How about we change that one around to, we know he's guilty.  Kill him.  All right, Jim.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Thanks, Jim.  Bye.  Ed's cracking me up on line seven here.  Ed, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, we're never going to catch Osama. 
[00:59:30]  Not with our military intelligence.  They're reporting that he got away by boat?  Yeah.  Afghanistan has no coast.  What kind of damn boat is he using?  Maybe that's so friggin' funny, man.  Maybe that boat that was in, what movie was it?  Mummy Returns?  No.  Or the Star Wars boat.  Oh.  When Jabba the Hutt was on in the desert.  The desert schooner.  All right, Ed.  The guy's absolutely right.  Very good.  It's a landlocked country. 
[01:00:00]  And he escaped by boat.  I'm going to freaking be sick.  Oh, brilliant.  I'm going to be sick.  Oh, God.  You guys are cracking me up today.  Sean, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Sean.  You're on the radio.  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Hey, man.  Got a little story that you can file under.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  Hold on.  Oh, yeah.  I know this one.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  That's right. 
[01:00:30]  It's the bitches that'll get you.  Gold digging twat alert.  Gold digging twat alert.  All right, what do you have, Sean?  Page four, New York Daily News.  Kirk Tukorian, for those people that don't know, he's the big Las Vegas mogul.  His ex-wife is suing him for $320,000 a month in child support for a three-year-old.  Here you go.  This is a great little story about how the bitches are bitches.  You got that right.  How much do diapers cost these days? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, well, let me go through some of the figures.  First of all, this guy's 84 years old.  84 years old.  The wife, former tennis pro, is 36.  Yeah.  So you tell me what her intentions were, okay?  Of course.  Come on, you know that.  Come on, we all know that.  84 years old.  So it turns out she got pregnant.  The guy didn't want the kid to be a little bastard child.  Right.  So he makes a deal and goes, all right, look, I'm going to marry you just for the sake of the kid. 
[01:01:30]  Then we divorce you a month later.  Yeah.  A month later, we're going to get a divorce.  And you have to sign papers that you cannot seek spousal support from me.  And she's like, okay, fine and dandy.  So they get married.  They have the kid.  Get the divorce.  Now, instead of trying to seek spousal support, she jacks up the child support to pay for her.  So, in essence, she's getting support from this guy who, you see, it doesn't matter what you sign. 
[01:02:00]  You think a prenup's getting you out of crap, guys?  Don't get married.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  Did you read the breakdown?  Yeah, let me go through some of this, Sean.  This is great stuff.  Among Lisa's listed child support needs, here it is, for a three-year-old, $144,000 a month for travel.  For the three-year-old.  To travel.  To travel.  Wait.  A month?  A month?  A month.  $14,000 for parties, guys. 
[01:02:30]  For parties and play dates, for a three-year-old child, $14,000 a month.  Wait a minute.  $14,000.  And a judge has accepted this?  Well, this is what they're, uh, this is what they're gunning for.  Yeah.  And you know something?  She'll get it.  This twat will get it.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Yeah.  $436 a month for the rabbit.  Yeah, get this.  She wants $436 a month to care for Kira's pet bunny rabbit.  A bunny rabbit needs $436 a month.  There are people, uh, in this city at least, uh, some of the homeless people who would kill. 
[01:03:00]  Who have killed.  Patty.  Our own stalker Patty would love $436, but it's going for a bunny.  How about this?  $7,000 for charity.  What the hell is a three-year-old going to give charity for?  A three-year-old giving to a charity needs $7,000.  A hundred and two thousand dollars a month for a three-year-old's food.  Food.  How much do you eat?  How much do you eat? 
[01:03:30]  Hey, Ed, if you add up the items on the list, on the article, it only comes up to $183,000.  Where is the other $136,000 coming from?  Yeah, I know.  Oh, one last thing.  $1,300 for laundry and cleaning of a three-year-old.  One last thing.  If, uh, anybody listening in Vegas and California, somebody tell Mr. Kikorian, uh, I mean Mr.  Drummond, that, uh, if he's looking to adopt a 29-year-old Negro child, I'm available for a going rate of $319,000 a month.  Later, guys.  Thank you, Sean.  I don't fault her, though.  If you drink out of an 84-year-old mule, you can't deserve whatever you can get. 
[01:04:00]  The guy thought he was in the clear with this bitch.  He said, you know something?  Look, you're signing something that says you are not going to go for, uh, spousal support.  We're just getting married, so this kid isn't a bastard.  And, and then we get a divorce in a month.  It's all out there in the open.  And then she rakes him with the child support.  What is he doing at 80-something banging without a bag anyway with all that money?  How stupid are you, sir?  Get a hooker or get oral treats. 
[01:04:30]  That's his fault.  You would think you're dope.  That octogenarian spunk wouldn't even.  I think you're right.  It does.  You know something?  You would, you would believe that that old, old mayonnaise wouldn't have the ability to create life.  What about the dumper?  What's wrong with this guy?  With all that money, he's just made flip over, stupid.  He's 50.  Hey, uh, before we wrap up this segment, yeah, the Nirvana saga continues, too.  Another part of the bitches that'll get you is Courtney Love, the biggest twat in rock and roll. 
[01:05:00]  Unbelievable.  We should have, we should have had a Nirvana box set out by now.  Yeah.  But we don't because, uh, Courtney Love is, uh, fighting for control of Nirvana.  Like, this bitch did anything for that band.  What song did she write?  What, uh, what, uh, oh, that's right, none.  What instrument did she play for the band?  None.  Huh.  I'll tell you what she had to do with Nirvana.  She, she, uh, played goddamn, uh, uh, Kurt's songs as whole.  Don't you tell me that those songs weren't written by Kurt Cobain. 
[01:05:30]  That, that skank.  And now the rest of the guys who were there making the tunes,  Busting their masters.  Busting their hump to get, uh, noticed and get a record deal.  Playing in the tiny clubs before they made it.  Yeah.  They can't.  Fighting with bar owners for their 70 bucks.  Exactly.  They can't, uh, you, put out a box set of their music.  They said this.  Because Courtney has say in what goes on with, uh, with Nirvana. 
[01:06:00]  They say this is going to be tied up in, uh, the courts for years to come.  Yeah.  Years.  You won't hear it.  You won't hear it.  Isn't that something?  The bitch.  The bitch.  Yeah.  Sing it, Joe Pesci.  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  It's the bitches out of kitches.  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  Joe Pesci.  Oh, it's Joe Pesci.  Yeah.  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  Put out a rap. 
[01:06:30]  It's a bitch's daddy kitchen.  Is it true that she's Jackie is calling the show today?  Yep.  Oh, Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Remember Jackie Fine?  She's Jackie.  And Jackie Fine's not just her name.  Let me tell you something.  Jackie Fine is Jackie.  What is, uh, what is she calling?  Um, probably within the hour.  We love she's Jackie.  We saw pictures of her in her book.  And Jackie Fine is so Jackie. 
[01:07:00]  So Jackie.  We love she's Jackie.  Of course.  She was quite the trooper.  Yeah.  Not like Robert Clary.  Who's Robert Clary?  Somebody else we have on the phone.  Robert Clary.  Clary.  Clary.  Robert Clary.  It's the bitch's daddy kitchen.  Nope.  Doesn't ring a bell.  All right, Ant.  We still have lots to do today.  Yeah.  A little too serious with the show today, I think.  Well, I think, uh... 
[01:07:30]  Are we changing our whole show because we suck in Washington?  No.  No, these are just issues.  Is that what we're doing today?  Issues that had to be addressed.  That we have to address.  Are we panicking as a radio show here?  No.  We got to get back to the effing virgins.  We go from 4th to 16th place in three months.  And now we've decided we need to be more serious.  Is that what's going on?  I hope not.  There's serious folks down there.  They like a certain brand of humor.  Who cares?  Well, that word brand got to you today, huh?  I really...  Because it symbolized a mentality that I effing hate. 
[01:08:00]  Just call on...  Your brand of humor.  You know, people have said to me, you suck.  And I...  All right, cool, man.  You don't like me, fine.  But that...  Just that...  You know, that brand of humor isn't for me, hon.  It's just...  All right, you yuppie.  Ugh.  All right.  I'm from Glen Burnie.  We like a little structure in our radio down here, don't we?  Glen Burnie.  You haven't forgotten that one.  Yeah, man.  It's a mentality.  You know, people have called up or emailed me, you blow, you're not funny.  I don't remember any of them, but it's certain wording that just makes me want to stick a knife in someone. 
[01:08:30]  All right.  Yeah, we'll do a Kid Chris O.J. Simpson prank call as we go to break here, okay?  Cool.  We still have the unlucky lottery on the way.  We've got to break out our new contest.  Jackie Fiennes calling in.  Lots of fun stuff on the way.  Yeah?  Oh, Juice?  Yeah?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Who's this? 
[01:09:00]  This is AC.  Hey, let's go kill somebody tonight.  Bye.  Juice?  Yeah, hello.  O.J.  Who's this?  It's Al Michaels.  My wife's been acting like a real bitch.  I was wondering if you could help me kill her.  What do you say, champ?  Do I know you?  Hey.  Juice, it's Chris Rock.  It's me, Chris Rock, Juice. 
[01:09:30]  What do you say you and I go kill the Spice Girls?  Juice, every time I call you, I always be laughing.  Hello?  Juice, you're late.  We're supposed to go out and kill people tonight.  What's going on?  I really can't talk.  I'm at dinner with a bunch of people, and I have no idea who you are.  I'm the real killer.  O.J.  Hello?  Yeah?  Yeah, Juice.  Yeah?  Juice, what's up? 
[01:10:00]  Who is this?  It's Dan Dierdorf.  You want to go throw the ball around, you know, have some beers, maybe kill somebody?  Yeah?  Hi, O.J., it's Kato.  Well, I want to go pick up some young girls and kill them.  We can hold them underwater or something.  How'd I go?  Can I move in with you?  Hello?  Hi, O.J. 
[01:10:30]  Hey.  Hey, it's Marcus Allen.  Want to go get some bitches and kill them?  Yeah.  God.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether to sit again and listen to you guys that drive down there and bash your heads in with a baseball bat.  M-E-W.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The show that is in 16th place in Washington, D.C. 
[01:11:00]  Thank you, Washington.  Yeah.  Well, they like a certain brand of humor.  You know, it's okay to have a mayor who smokes crack, but don't do any type of table jokes.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is an exact quote from Super GM, Ken Stevens, who also runs the Washington Station, as well as the station in Philly and here in New York.  I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster.  Disaster is such a strong word.  I don't think you ever want to hear your boss say that about your job. 
[01:11:30]  Disaster.  Doesn't it mean disastrous?  Yes.  There's no way of spinning that quote.  Then again, maybe he means it's been a while.  I even asked him if I could quote him.  He goes, oh, yeah, make sure you write this down.  I'm like, okay, I got a pen.  I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster.  And everyone's having a good old laugh today.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  A gay old time.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I told you so.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, well. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, we just got to, uh, boy, that took the wind.  Out of our sails, huh, guys?  Just got to put on a better show, I guess, Opie.  We must be, um, we were feeling good about the ratings.  Had some nice comebacks in some of these, uh, cities.  Uh-huh.  And then, uh, the biggest, uh, ratings disaster.  That's good.  Ken Stevens has only been in the business, I think, 30 years.  And that's the biggest disaster?  Wow. 
[01:12:30]  30 years and, all right.  Dude, every email you've gotten or instant feedback you've gotten is from some fat married zero.  That's who those emails are from.  Some just fat married guy.  No, I mean...  Let me adjust my tie and type this out.  Let's see what Bob and the other guys in the office think of this.  Hey, come to my cubicle.  Bunch of happened, boars.  Jim, I'm reading the instant feedback, and I'm, uh, I'm, uh, I'm looking for some, uh, some positive, uh, instant feedbacks from Washington. 
[01:13:00]  And, uh, I think eventually we'll come across one.  Holy S.  Chris, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, man.  Hey.  I listen from D.C. every day.  Oh, yeah?  And listen how excited you sound.  What hope do we have?  Hey, man, I'm, I'm here for you.  Hey, well, I get high.  I listen.  I also think cancer's funny.  Cancer's cool. 
[01:13:30]  All right, Chris, thank you.  Not too promising, I have to say.  You sound pretty dull.  Mm-hmm.  I just, uh, well, uh, I, I listen here in Washington, D.C., and, uh, well, tell you the truth, if I had the energy, I'd get up and turn the dial.  Yeah, I'm just too lazy to get up and change the station.  So, I'm here for you guys.  Yeah.  At least until the nurse comes and she could turn the dial for me.  Hey, I don't have cancer.  I'm working on it. 
[01:14:00]  All right, Chris, thank you.  Thanks.  Ah, screw it.  Thanks for the support.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, what are you going to do, Ant?  Oh, that, that hurts.  What?  Oh, and A, the Mason and Kalinsky of D.C.?  All right, look.  All right.  Now, now I, now I've had enough.  All right, look, we're different than a lot of radio shows and we'll allow you to abuse us, but come on, man.  That's getting a little different.  Don't you know where the line is?  Don't you know where the line is?  We certainly do.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, well.  It's just a little different than Mason and Kalinsky, too.  You know?  We went from having huge numbers in Washington when we stepped in and we brought them down to nothing.  They're a show that came in and just got nothing.  Wow.  Mason and Kalinsky.  All right, so we have a little, a slight, slight setback.  Yeah.  Are you Nordic?  Oh, no, you're not wearing a parka. 
[01:15:00]  We're a little distracted today.  Mason and Kalinsky came into a slot here at N.E.W. and just were unable to get ratings.  A lot different than that.  Can I explain the Washington ratings, Anthony?  Yeah.  They got good chemo down in Washington.  What?  Well, the O.P. and Anthony show, it's like a virus and we're spreading all across.  North America. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, they're like a cure.  They've been able to cure that virus?  Well, they've been able to keep it down with the chemo.  Hair's falling out all over the place, but the virus isn't spreading.  Thank God.  I mean, oh, damn.  They're able to keep it down.  Cleveland, the virus is running rapid.  Maybe we started the whole format thing where we do things like the six o'clock queef and the bitches that'll get you and all that fun stuff.  And guess Opie's ethnicity. 
[01:16:00]  Dude.  Maybe we started that too late.  Dude.  If we ever do a bit like that, it's over, Johnny.  For real.  It's over, Jenny.  We heard the worst bit ever today.  Yeah.  I don't even know how to say the word, so.  I didn't hear it because I don't get up that early.  Well, it's just a bit where you guess the radio host's nationality.  Yeah.  No, it's not.  By asking questions.  Like, Jim.  Yes, Opie?  I have no clue what you are, so this is how the game is played. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  And by asking you the questions, I'm supposed to guess what your nationality is.  Jim, do you drink a lot?  No, Opie.  I guess you're not Irish.  Come on.  Cut it out.  Anthony, it's to you.  Guffaw.  Anthony, it's to you.  Are you a guy that likes getting it in the balloon knot?  I'm certainly not. 
[01:17:00]  I guess Greek's out of the question.  Oh, come on.  That in French.  Kill two birds, one stone there.  Oh, my stars.  I may quote me, French, gay, whatever.  Jim, around the holidays, do you give your relatives hubcaps?  I certainly think not.  I guess you're not Puerto Rican. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, what a game.  Did someone in Rick's family actually give hubcaps one Christmas?  My girlfriend, Sandy, who's Rick's sister, got hubcaps the first Christmas I ever spent with Rick's family for Christmas.  That is, you must have, Opie, be honest with me.  When you saw that, you had to have thought they were joking to make a goof and make you laugh.  I should have seen the sign.  Yeah.  I should have saw the sign. 
[01:18:00]  Am I lying?  Do you think it was your mom's boyfriend?  I forgot his name.  Lenny.  What?  Lenny.  Lenny.  I would think they were goofing with me.  Lenny wrapped up hubcaps for your sister for Christmas.  I would think they were goofing on me.  And I'd have to sit there and go, oh, hubcaps, those are nice.  No, don't you get it?  It's like a Puerto Rican joke.  Hubcaps for the car that your dad decided to take back.  Yep.  Sorry for another day.  Were they sold out of tattoos and prison sentences?  Are we guessing Jim's nationality or what? 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on, guys.  Back to where we're going here.  Jim's ethnicity.  Here we go.  All right.  Who's up?  Why don't you guess, Anthony?  This was a real bit we heard on the radio today.  I don't believe you, but I'll play along.  This couldn't have been a bit.  Come on now.  It's your turn, fresh one.  All right.  Would your sister have hairy arms? 
[01:19:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  She does not.  Italian's out of the question.  All right.  Oh, brother.  All right, let me get a little saucy here.  Uh-oh.  Jim, do you eat a lot of fried chicken for lunch?  Oh, my God.  I haven't had fried chicken in about two years.  No.  I guess you're not black.  No, he didn't.  Because that's a stereotypical.  Look at me, Pete, how racist.  Oh, my God. 
[01:19:30]  Blacks ain't horrific.  Oh, my dear.  Oh, dear.  And I assume you cash your paycheck at a bank, right?  For the love of Eve, you bet.  Do you know how many grilled cheese sandwiches you can make from a block of government cheese?  That was one of the questions.  No, I do not. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  I get it.  What's your nationality?  Um, mostly Irish.  Oh, oh, oh.  Wow.  And you did say that before, but I threw you a zinger.  What a great...  Oh, oh.  Sometimes you've got to throw a curveball in the radio world.  We're giggly today.  Tony, what's going on?  Giggly.  We're giggly.  Tony.  Hey, guys. 
[01:20:30]  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I've got an idea how you can bring your radars up in D.C.  Yeah.  First thing you do, Opie, you have your girl call up and babble about something that  you guys, only the two of you care about, for about 15, 20 minutes.  Wow.  Then you get somebody that has a kid to call up and talk about what time he needs to go  to bed or whatever.  Ah.  And then, Anthony, you just laugh like an idiot in the background for no apparent reason.  Ah.  Because apparently the other guys work the bad way.  All right.  I would rather have a ball removed.  Thank you, Tony. 
[01:21:00]  Ah, well.  Hey, this getting punched in the stomach is fun, isn't it?  I was trying to get some air today.  The black joke was over 10 minutes ago.  Hey, guys.  What?  Hey, what happened to Jackie Fine?  She's Jackie.  She's calling in at about a half hour.  Yeah.  You thought she was good enough for the 5 o'clock hour when the most people are listening?  No, she's doing a TV show right now.  That's where we have our highest cume, everyone. 
[01:21:30]  She's more like a 320 guest.  The warm-up part of the show.  5-20, that's when you've got to be rocking.  Right.  That's when you have girls doing their thing.  All right.  Do we have some unlucky lottery stories?  Oh, you button your lip.  Norton, you button your lip for this one.  Wait, Bobby Bigrigger wants to say something.  Bobby Bigrigger. 
[01:22:00]  Hey, guys.  A little word of encouragement.  Yeah.  Just keep your chin up.  Oh, we're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to turn this thing around.  That's right.  We've got to turn this thing around.  You got your toolbar in?  All right.  Grab your toolbar.  There you go.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Turn this thing around as well.  All right, guys.  I'm going to listen to myself later.  Thank you.  Well, yeah, the unlucky lottery.  We talk about this a lot.  It's something that happens to you. 
[01:22:30]  The odds of it happening are probably greater than the odds of winning the lottery.  No, probably.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah, definitely.  You would have a better chance winning the lottery than this certain thing happening to you.  If I had a million dollars.  This thing is horrible.  So it's the unlucky lottery.  Instead of winning money, you win death.  This is East Haven, Vermont.  A Connecticut man was killed Saturday when the snowmobile he was riding collided with a moose. 
[01:23:00]  A moose-in.  On a remote trail.  A moose-in.  Moose-in.  A box of moose.  Moose-in.  No one witnessed.  What is it?  No one witnessed the collision between Ross T. Knight, 23, and the moose.  The moose, I guess, is nameless.  Ha-ha.  Huddle, huddle.  I'll bet he is.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  A friend at night came upon the scene and took him to a nearby camp where efforts to revive 
[01:23:30]  night failed.  Alcohol may have played a role in the accident.  Nothing worse than a drunken moose.  Ha-ha-ha.  Wow, you're lying.  The moose was drinking.  Wow, you flipped that one around.  I thought you were going to say that the guy in the snowmobile was drinking.  Wow, you're too...  Mooses can't drink.  You're too quick for this radio show.  I'll tell you, it's hard to keep up with you.  That's a brandy humor I can enjoy.  Ha-ha. 
[01:24:00]  Boy, you're something.  Ugh, I'd love to know a brand of leukemia that guy's mother dies of.  Wasn't there another story about Unlucky Lottery?  Yes.  Where's the other one?  Because we had like two or three today.  That is the story of...  Again, I was speaking about Utah and Colorado when I was there and saw all those great rocks 
[01:24:30]  that are resting on these little, looks like golf tees of stone.  Been there for millions of years.  Well, it seems one decided to fall right when someone's car was driving by.  Oh, my God.  How awful is that?  Boy killed in rush hour rock slide.  Unlucky lottery.  What are the odds?  The rock is sitting there for years.  Boulders crash down on a mountainside in Colorado. 
[01:25:00]  Anthony?  Yeah.  I've heard that they've arrested the roadrunner.  Oh, my.  I guess the car didn't see the sign that said free bird seed.  Was that an Acme rock?  Oh, you got me.  I was going to say, I heard there was an Acme truck nearby.  But that drove into the rock that was painted with a tunnel on it. 
[01:25:30]  Huddle, huddle, huddle.  The roadrunner ran through it, but the truck crashed.  Oh, my.  Oh, good gosh.  Was TNT involved?  Let me fix my...  Interstate 70.  Glenwood Springs, Colorado.  The boulder caved in the right side of the vehicle when it rolled down the mountain into a truck  where a young boy was sitting and killed him.  There you go.  You're driving by, mind your own beeswax, 
[01:26:00]  and all of a sudden, a rock comes and hits you.  Unlucky lottery?  Yes, I think so.  Well, Chris has another unlucky lottery story.  Chris?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a great unlucky lottery story for you.  Yes.  Is this off the AP?  Yeah, it is, actually.  That's got to be true, then.  Okay.  It's about these two amazing DJs who got syndicated across the country.  Yeah.  And then got ranked 16th in a major market.  Hey, man, that's not funny. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, whoa, pal.  Hey, look, we're trying to do the best we can here.  Hey, I know.  You guys, believe me, you guys are awesome.  They just don't understand what's going on down there.  We don't really need the negativity today.  Maybe if you guys put a little more DMX.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Remember, Sarah Jessica Parker is the white Shannon shop.  Talk to you later.  That's like my grandfather used to say, you've got to take the bitter with the better.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what you do.  That sounds like sour grapes to me.  Life serves you up lemons, you make lemonade. 
[01:27:00]  You certainly do.  Don't need to call a radio show and start ribbing everyone.  Good gosh.  Hey, man, the glass is half full, not empty.  Yes, but there's AIDS in it.  You know what today's like?  You've been banging the hottest chick, and then you find out that she's got the hiv.  Oh, what happened?  Wow.  I knew I shouldn't have told you that story.  Again?  Good thing, though. 
[01:27:30]  You can only get it once.  And you know she won't get fat.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, folks.  I know that's not the type of brand of humor you tune in for.  Penny for your thoughts, Norton.  Penny for your thoughts.  Well, then you'll hold me change.  Hold on, hold on.  It's just awful. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, well.  It's beautiful.  I've never seen a bigger ratings disaster.  Ben Stevens, general manager of WJFK.  Look at me.  What the hell is going on?  They're writing that on the instant feedback.  Oh, golly, good gravy. 
[01:28:30]  Let's keep it to heck, huh, gang?  Oh, mercy me.  We're a little out of control here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Anthony.  Ed's telling us to stop cracking wise.  Ed from Brooklyn.  Stop cracking wise. 
[01:29:00]  Anthony?  Yeah.  We got some encouraging words from our boss down in Washington, D.C.  Oh, thank God.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ken Stevens.  Ken, what do you got for us?  We're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Thank you, Ken.  Let's just stick with me.  If I just want to turn this thing around.  Well, we have confidence in you, sir.  We're going to get through this, though.  We've just got to keep your chin up.  I hope you're right, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ken Stevens.  We're going to get through this. 
[01:29:30]  We're going to turn this thing around.  That's inspirational words.  I hope you're right.  Yeah.  Sounds like you've been drinking all day, Mr. Stevens.  You all right?  We're going to get through this.  We know.  All right.  We're going to keep our chins up.  Thank you.  We know.  We know.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's just stick with me.  First of all, we'll turn this thing around.  All right, Ken.  All right.  Enough.  We get it.  Thank you, Ken.  Thank you.  Maybe we should get back to our normal brand of humor. 
[01:30:00]  Do we even know what that is at this point?  Jeepers creepers.  Jiminy cricket.  Joe, Joe, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Aren't we supposed to be trying to gain listeners, guys?  Well, you'd be surprised.  This is like that Brian Regan bit where the falling rock zone should actually say road closed.  Yeah, road closed.  Hey, guys. 
[01:30:30]  Brandon from Brooklyn telling us not to be such sore heads.  Don't be a sore head.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Jesse.  I'm calling from Cleveland.  I'll tell you what, man.  I don't know what the hell happened to the ratings, but I know everybody up here listens to you guys.  Cleveland, we're fine.  Cleveland's great.  Yeah.  What's going on?  I love the aggravated humor.  Cleveland?  It works for South Park.  Cleveland, we're more gooder.  More gooder.  Washington, D.C., it couldn't get any worse. 
[01:31:00]  They don't like our malarkey that we're pulling here on a daily basis.  All right.  Well, Cleveland, people get it.  They know you're just pulling their legs.  But I'll tell you, by hook or by crook, we're going to get them.  Don't be such a sour puss.  Faggoty, white, pussy boy, suburban humor.  Oh, yeah.  All right. 
[01:31:30]  Jackie Fine calling in today, Anthony.  Yeah, Jackie Fine.  Remember her?  We had her on the phone a while back.  Had her picture in that book that she had.  And she's...  I'll tell you.  Fine ain't just her last name.  She sure is Jackie.  So, looking forward to that.  Hey, this is a good unlucky lottery.  Marcos, what's up?  This is a tragic story that happened last week. 
[01:32:00]  Go ahead, Marcos.  Yeah, you guys hear about that little girl that got shot in the back of the head?  She was standing down watching TV.  Watching Winnie the Pooh.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's not...  Ready for this?  The bullet didn't come through the window.  It came through the wall of the house.  Through the wall.  It was a hunting rifle.  What are the odds of that happening?  It ricocheted off something.  Yeah.  It was real bad, man, because I worked for EMS, and I seen everything, bro.  It was bloody.  Yeah.  That's another unlucky lottery.  I mean, because that...  That's another one. 
[01:32:30]  All right, guys.  Thank you, Marcos.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bringing the whole show down with that story.  Well, we're going to take a break and regroup, Anthony.  We've got to talk about Aussie reality TV.  What about our new idea that starts up Monday?  It's a good one, too.  Good about that.  And what about our virgins?  Come on, virgin girls.  We still need a virgin.  We're looking for a girl that's a virgin, wants to lose her virginity by Valentine's Day.  You could use your own boyfriend.  Don't worry.  We're not going to hook you up with one of these dregs of society. 
[01:33:00]  Unless you want us to.  Unless you want us to.  It won't be something that has to be on the air.  We'll set it up.  You want a hotel room?  We'll get you one.  You want to do it in a limo?  You got it.  You make the rules.  We just want to end your virginity.  That's all.  So, calling all virgins.  Give us a call.  Let me go to Uncle John as we go to break here.  A contributor to the show.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  What's up?  Hey, let me tell you.  The energy in our room today is just infectious, man. 
[01:33:30]  People are dropping like flies.  As I'm driving around, I'm watching them fall down.  Come on.  Are you ribbing us?  Gee, I wouldn't do that.  I would Josh you, by golly.  He just wanted to call up and give you guys the business.  That's right.  I just wanted to rub your nose in a little bit.  That's all.  Oh, John and his shenanigans.  Yeah, well, it's time for you boys to eat crawler.  I'm such a kidder.  Jumping jaws of that.  Hey, readjust your tie there, Jim.  It's a...  There you go. 
[01:34:00]  Well, by golly, I better go back to work.  All right, I'll continue.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  I heard a doozy by the water cooler.  A real dilly.  But all kidding aside, be safe.  You're such a dick.  I love it.  A muffle.  And action.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie Anthony. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  And we appreciate it.  Rebecca calling us from Washington, D.C.  What's up, Rebecca?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know, yesterday I spent about 45 minutes of my rush hour commute  and find someone with a wow sticker on their car down here.  So there are a couple people listening, and I listen faithfully every day. 
[01:35:00]  So, uh, y'all have some hope left in this market.  There's still hope for O&A down here?  A little bit.  That's what they said of Michael Landon when they were giving him the coffee enemas.  Oh.  That was harsh, guys.  Thank you, Rebecca.  Talk to you later.  All right.  Peace.  Notice the people that are trying to support us from Washington, they have no energy.  I know. 
[01:35:30]  I love you so.  Uh, Jason from Riverhead says, uh, us ruffians need to knock off the jibber-jabbering.  But Chris liked the game with, uh, Mr. Norton.  It was a real humdinger.  Saying, wear the cat's pajamas.  Calling us a bunch of Weisenheimers, too.  Uh, Kevin's a little upset at our dilly-dallying today, trying to get to things.  We seem to be dilly-dallying. 
[01:36:00]  Just a tad.  Just a tad.  And, um, Mark thinks this brand of humor is a little racy.  A little saucy.  A little saucy.  Yeah.  Uh, EAF finds this, uh, gibberish, uh, drivel and double-talk bunk.  Calls this hogwash hot air and bologna claptrap.  And Mike is calling us rapscallions.  Joe from Cleveland writes, hey, those D.C. hooligans are just a bunch of Weisenheimers.  Yeah, well, Joe, why don't you use your head for something besides a hat rack? 
[01:36:30]  Ah, this is going to get our numbers just booming in D.C.  It will.  I can tell this type of, uh, comedy.  Brand.  This brand of comedy.  We're changing our brand of humor, Anthony.  It's because it's this brand of comedy that they want.  It's got to be fun for all.  Ha, ha, ha.  Type of thing you could have the gal in the passenger seat and not be embarrassed.  Ha, ha.  I think this show needs some moxie.  Yeah.  That's what'll do it.  A little moxie. 
[01:37:00]  A little get-up-and-go-get-ya.  We've got to put a little elbow grease into this show.  Yeah, buckle down.  Buckle down.  Pull ourselves up by the bootstraps.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And just put your best foot forward.  Have a little gumption.  Well, Lydia from D.C. has an opinion about the show.  Lydia.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  What's up?  Uh, D.C. doesn't go in for these backdoor shenanigans.  Oh, no?  No.  Sorry about that.  All right.  You're right. 
[01:37:30]  Who has more energy?  The, uh, are Washington listeners or George Bush when he was passed out on the floor after  choking on a pretzel?  Boom.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, you guys.  You know what's going on?  You're a bunch of wet blankets.  You've got to put a little pep into the show.  Come on.  A little pep into it?  Yeah, a little pep.  Come on.  Maybe that'll do it.  Yeah, you know, drink some Pepsi, a little pep.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Have a good one, guys. 
[01:38:00]  You need a little pep in your step.  Hey, pal, no need to be such a stick in the mud.  Ah, Junk Mill Jerry's, uh, saying enough with O&A's Boulder Dash.  And Norton's Poppycock.  I like the game Boulder Dash.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, you really need to stop running all nilly on the airwaves with that hoop nanny.  You guys said be good.  Bye.  Oh, hoop nanny. 
[01:38:30]  You're all right.  Come on.  Pipe down.  What's the hullabaloo?  Simmer down.  Simmer down.  Someone found a thesaurus from 1920.  Hoot nanny.  Hoot nanny, Norton.  Cause, uh, can't seem to see why we're not doing well in Washington.  He thinks we're the bee's knees.  I've never heard that.  Now they're coming up with new ones.  Have you ever heard that one before?  Of course.  Sure.  Dag nabbit.  Oh, gee willikers. 
[01:39:00]  This is too much.  I think, uh, you know, this reality of the Washington situation ought to give us a shot in the arm.  You know what I mean?  Oh, kick in the ass.  What?  All right.  Let's go to Joe.  Okay.  Another DC listener.  DC.  Any more energy here?  Hey, Joe.  What's up, bro?  Hey. 
[01:39:30]  There's some energy.  Hey, how you doing?  You guys got a bunch of tools calling up.  And tell Rebecca if she sees a goddamn worry.  Whoa.  Hey.  Hey.  The show doesn't need that brand of language.  I know.  I'm all excited, you know.  A little more spice than we asked for.  Yeah, spice it up a little, but please.  By golly, I'm sorry, Wally.  You don't need to work blue.  We're outrageous.  We don't like that kind of horseplay.  You guys are kicking ass out here.  I'm really, everyone I talk to is listening to you guys. 
[01:40:00]  Well, do you guys write?  Yeah.  We can't spell, but we can write.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, David has some advice for us, Anthony.  David.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's happening?  What's up?  Listen, this is Washington Ratings.  You just got to take it with a grain of salt.  Take it with a grain of salt.  Thank you, David.  I just don't like thinking we were hoodwinked by some of the calls we got before the rating. 
[01:40:30]  We're, um, they sounded like they were on board, you know, for the show.  We might have been bushwhacked.  The hoodwinked.  Brian, what's up?  Well, you got a little taste of reality soup.  Had your head in the clouds, didn't you?  Yeah, certainly did.  Oh, my.  Our blinders were down.  Brian, go ahead.  These people from D.C. are really starting to get my goat.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, you should have gotten a gander at those ratings, though.  Josh, what's up?  I'm not looking at the big picture.  Yeah, guys, I just want to tell you, stop being such sweaters.  You're really the cat's pajamas.  Yeah.  Come on.  I don't think we could see the forest for the trees.  I'm going to look at the big picture.  Ryan, what's going on?  Everyone's got to get on board.  Yes.  Hey, guys.  I just want to, you know, let's cut the tomfoolery here.  Let's see what we really feel.  Washington's got no chutzpah.  Okay?  Oh, my. 
[01:41:30]  Joe, what's going on?  Oh, jumping Jehoshaphat.  What's going on here with these racy people in D.C.?  I don't get it.  Maybe this is the type of radio they want to hear by gum.  Oh, my God.  Gee, you're killing me out here.  You know, we might be getting a little zany here,  but I think it's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  I don't even want to talk. 
[01:42:00]  I just want to listen to you and agree and laugh along.  Well, God willing, and the river don't rise.  Hey, from your lips to God's ears.  Oh, my God.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  First time, long time?  Thank you.  What's all the Sam Hill yelling about over there?  D.C. sucks.  I've never heard of that one. 
[01:42:30]  Stop sassing D.C. like that.  There's no need to sass the audience.  I've seen some of the girls down there.  A lot of hot pieces of A.  Oh, geez, Louise.  Well, let me go to Dan.  Dan, what's going on?  Dan?  Oh, hey.  Hey, Dan.  Hey, guys.  I wouldn't worry.  These Washington Flybody Knights wouldn't know comedy if I bit them on the bottom.  I bit them on the bottom. 
[01:43:00]  Thanks, guys.  You suck.  I like the way we could just banter ideas back and forth like this.  I bit them on the bottom.  It's good.  It's not too far, but far enough.  Oh, ho.  A little racy.  Enjoy that.  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, Norton's going to stop his belly aching and quit being a bucket mouth.  No, no, I just, uh, I think D.C. might just be a few Fairweather fans.  That's what I like to call them, the Fairweather. 
[01:43:30]  Holy ass.  Wow.  You were on hold.  You got a treat there.  Wow.  You can't say that, Norton.  My God.  You've got a regular potty mouth.  Discretion is the better part of valor.  Man, Jim, you threw us all a curveball there.  Didn't know how to handle it.  Don't you keep me on your toes?  Oh, my.  Oh, jeepers, jeepers. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, goodness gracious.  Well, sure.  Sean, what's going on?  I haven't, I think I got an aneurysm.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  I said, I said, those D.C. fans are about as sharp as a bag of wet mime.  Thank you, Sean.  I think we've just got to take this and turn the other cheek. 
[01:44:30]  That'll do it.  Let it roll off you like water off a duck's back.  That's what we got to do.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  Can't take it personally.  I think Jackie Fine's checking in.  Someone's on the hotline.  Yeah.  Cheese, Jackie.  Mm-hmm.  The lobby security.  Lobby security?  Uh-oh, that's never good.  Here, with this great, um...  Hey, let's...  Wait, put them on... 
[01:45:00]  I want to hear lobby security.  Let's hear this great security.  Ah, they're gone now.  See, that could have been a new feature on our show.  Lobby security.  Lobby security.  Brought to you with the cooperation of the men and women of 8887BASS.  Bad boy, bad boy.  You don't have a pass?  You don't have a pass?  You can kiss my ass back by...  Sorry, I was get working blue.  Oh, he's got to get into the gutter. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, but all the cubicles turn their radios off there.  Don't need Boss Jones here.  Boss Jones.  Old man Jones over there.  Jim, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  If you two stopped lollygagging around, you could probably be on a humdinger of a show.  Take it easy, guys.  Lollygagging.  Oh, dang it.  Enough of this riff-raff.  Guys, we've just got to pull together and give it the old college try. 
[01:46:00]  Look at Pete from Boston saying,  Oh, for the love of God, stop this, please.  Hey, that's not funny.  Why don't you guys quit chiding each other?  I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster.  Disaster.  Gentleman manager, Ken Stevens, of the Washington, D.C. station.  Put our nose to the grindstone and not be bamboozled again by any of them. 
[01:46:30]  Susan.  What's up, man?  I think this thing of Washington, it's crap.  They're the ones that broke the camel's back.  I love you guys.  We'll see you soon.  Go back to Boston.  Bye, guys.  All right.  There she goes.  Susan, thank you.  We're dilly-dallied enough.  Washington certainly keeping us honest.  I'll tell you what. 
[01:47:00]  Those D.C. people, that's a tough nut to crack.  You mean nut like in a mechanical sense.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They want to have to get the sensors out.  Oh, my.  Sorry.  Sorry, Jim.  I dropped the F-bomb by accident.  Smelled so bad, Pete Johnson had to wash it. 
[01:47:30]  Heavens to Murgatroyd.  Let's move on.  Hey, can we announce our new contest?  Yes.  Okay.  It's a little late for today, but when are we going to start it?  I think we're starting on Monday.  Monday?  Monday we start the contest.  We have a great prize.  We just don't know what it is yet, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's either going to be a trip to hedonism or some cold, hard cash.  Cash always good.  Starting Monday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:48:00]  The Naughty Nighty contest.  Naughty Nighty.  The Naughty Nighty contest starts Monday on the Opie and Anthony show.  You want to explain it?  It's easy.  It's just like all the other contests we have had in the past.  Oh, very easy.  Girls, you just got to show up here at the studio with your Naughty Nighty on.  The not here, the better.  And we'll take pictures, and we'll get our finalists, put them up on the website, and  then the listeners will vote.  We'll vote.  On their favorite Naughty Nighty. 
[01:48:30]  The Naughtiest Naughty.  This is a way for you to become a star.  Naughty.  Isn't it naughty?  A bit risque.  A bit risque.  A bit risque.  The Naughty Nighty contest starts Monday on the O&A show.  Ladies, you don't have to call up and say you're coming down.  Just show up between 3 and 7 all next week, okay?  Right.  Oh, except for Friday, though.  What's going on Friday?  Because a week from Friday, we're going to be broadcasting live from a city that adores  us.  Yes. 
[01:49:00]  The city of brotherly love.  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  We'll be down in Philly a week from Friday to support Norton's two sold-out shows.  Thank you.  Yeah.  And on that day, a week from Friday, that's when Philadelphia could be in on the contest.  So all you lovely ladies in the Philadelphia area, you just stop by the WISP studios a  week from Friday with your Naughty Nighties.  And get involved in this brouhaha.  That's right.  And we'll be taking your pictures in the studio, and we'll be placing those up on the website  for everyone to vote.  Right. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  And for the other people in the other cities, you're pretty much, unfortunately, S out of  luck, because I don't even know why the lawyers got involved and they effed us.  But basically, if you could drive to New York next week, we're going to do this for like  two weeks.  Wow.  It starts next week, and it'll last about two weeks.  If you could drive down to Naughty Nighty, that'd be great.  If some of the stations we syndicate to want to get involved in this contest, they've got  to contact Ben, and maybe we could set up some way of having the ladies show up at your  studio so you can take the pictures and make sure they're legal and all that crap. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  All the stuff that the lawyers are worried about.  Stupid lawyers.  But for now, it's a contest for the New York area and for the Philadelphia area.  And don't cheat, because that's dirty pool.  But I think some of the ladies in the Boston area will drive down for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get Boston, PA.  Just show up.  Just show up next week between 3 and 7 when we're broadcasting, except for Friday, because  we'll be live in Philly, and that's where the girls in the Philly area could, you know,  come down with their Naughty Nighty.  Right. 
[01:50:30]  You know, on the contest.  Okay?  Exactly.  And we'll tell you exactly what the prize is going to be by Monday.  They're just nailing it down.  Yeah, but the damn lawyers had to jump in and put the kibosh on the original contest.  Yeah.  Kind of shut down the whole kit and caboodle.  Whoa!  Jason!  What's up, guys?  They're leaning on our parade.  I just want to say, if you guys are so mad, why don't you just take a long walk off a short  cliff?  Huddle, huddle.  Huddle, huddle. 
[01:51:00]  J.D. from Staten Island says it all.  Golly, Miss Molly, is this bit being driven into the ground?  Yeah.  Got to agree with you there.  So there you have it.  Naughty Nighty contest starts next week.  Ladies, help us out.  We need your support on this one, okay?  We need to get some real nice ladies on the website for all the listeners to vote on.  Okay?  All right.  Come on.  And let me just appeal to D.C.  Come on, D.C.  Come on board. 
[01:51:30]  You know, this newfangled show with the two whippersnappers?  Maybe you could get on board.  Bunch of Johnny-come-latelys they are.  Yeah.  Johnny-come-latelys.  We're not a hand-me-down show.  Hand-me-down?  We're not out to horn-swoggle anybody.  No.  We're not a couple of old curmudgeons.  I'm not a curmudgeons.  D.C. blows with its high prime rate. 
[01:52:00]  Hey, guys, we've got to take a break because Jackie Fine is on the line.  Yes, and of course, she is so Jackie.  She is so Jackie.  We'll talk to her next.  Dirty.  Okay.  Can I see your taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Between the peach and the balloon knot.  Can we see your butt?  Nice.  I would have to just blank on your chin.  Does this guy know how to party or what?  Okay, terrific.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:52:30]  Ah, Anthony, Sam Adams.  You seen Sam Adams' new TV commercial about Sam Adams' great taste?  There's a little big Ballyhoo going on about it.  They're pretty outrageous.  Some of them have been banned in Minneapolis and Atlanta.  You hear about that?  I guess they're a little racy.  That's what the copy says.  I've seen a couple of them.  They're kind of going for the more outrageous commercial now, Sam Adams. 
[01:53:00]  I don't care what they do on their spots.  I just know it's great beer.  Great beer.  We love it.  Drink it here all the time.  Go to samadams.com.  There's a samadams.com?  And you can check out the new ads.  Yeah, because I don't really know what they're talking about, about them being outrageous and  banned in Minneapolis and Atlanta.  All I know, they make great beer.  Great beer.  I hear they have hot pictures of bottles on their website.  Yeah.  Sweaty bottles.  Some without the label on it. 
[01:53:30]  We love it.  We drink it here.  Mm-mm.  You'll love it too.  Sam Adams.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, you're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Boy.

Jackie.  Yeah, Jackie. 
[01:54:30]  Hey.  Jackie Fine.  Hey.  Hey, you guys.  Hey.  Hey.  You remember talking to us about a year ago?  Oh, how could I forget?  What's up, baby?  How could I forget?  Yeah.  Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Yeah, baby.  Did you guys get the email that I got from one of your listeners?  Uh, I don't know.  I don't know.  What do they say?  Well, you have to have Rick to show it to you.  What's up?  It was really cute.  What do I say, man? 
[01:55:00]  So, what's going on?  So, how's New York?  New York's all right.  Good.  Or should I say, it's tight.  It's tight.  It's doing okay.  Now, Jackie, remind the audience what your book is about.  Book, video, CD, Viacream.  Oh, the cream.  Yes, I had the Viacream.  You're not about the cream.  Wasn't that like the cream?  That was like the Viagra cream for the...  Hello, Jackie?  Jackie, where did Jackie go? 
[01:55:30]  Jackie, phone call got knocked the end out.  What happened?  We didn't even say anything bad yet.  She hung up.  I hope...  I mean, we...  What happened?  Dude, are the phones screwed up?  Because people could be calling to see me at the Stress Factory this Thursday through Saturday.  Oh, God damn disgusting.  This is no time for a plug.  Dude, who...  I didn't mean it as a plug.  There she is.  She's back.  All right.  Jackie finds...  She's Jackie.  Jackie!  What are you guys doing?  What happened?  No, I...  You know something?  I know. 
[01:56:00]  I got to say...  Hold on.  Let me tell you something, Jackie.  Especially our audience.  I got to...  We might even pull crap like that sometimes.  But we got to get to the meat of a conversation before we hang up on people.  That was really something went amiss there.  I got you.  Something went a little awry.  I got you.  Now, Jackie, you were talking about your cream.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Please hold the phone there, Jackie.  We can't be that in-depth in our description of what this cream is.  We know what the cream is for. 
[01:56:30]  It's for the little man on the boat?  Exactly.  Yeah, let's just call him that.  The little man on the boat.  Okay.  You rub the cream on his little head.  Yeah.  And what is...  When you rub it on his little head, and he gets excited.  Mm-hmm.  He starts to get wet.  Mm-hmm.  And he stands at attention.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  That's right, brother.  But if your audience doesn't, you know, don't recall who I am... 
[01:57:00]  Let's just put it this way.  It turns a four into a six.  Can I give him a little bit of background information on this?  Yeah, you do that, Jackie.  Okay.  Well, for the past 14 years, I've worked with the American Institute of Human Abilities,  and I'm a part of a group of sex and relationship experts that have spent the last 35 years  helping couples and individuals improve their sex life.  And we created a series of videos that illustrate our research for His Eyes Only and Her Eyes Only.  Behind the back, yeah.  The ultimate sexual experience. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, man.  The ultimate guide to making a relationship work.  And the one that's, you know, getting ready to come up is the ultimate Valentine.  Keep talking.  Yes.  What we basically do is take a frozen relationship with people who are looking to make a romance  in their relationship and support them and ways to do that.  Yes, I bet that, baby.  So now they read your book.  They see the video.  What is this going to do for somebody? 
[01:58:00]  It improves their relationship.  It gives them different things that they can do.  For example, for His Eyes Only and Her Eyes Only,  we have 26 different sex positions that you can try.  Because oftentimes people will say, you know, that they need some variety.  I know one.  In and out.  In their relationship.  But all of these can be seen at justassjackie.com.  I'm sorry?  Jackie Fine.  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position out of 26?  He's such a chowder head. 
[01:58:30]  My favorite position?  Yeah.  If I told you, I'd have to kill you.  No one's pointing to his crotch again.  He's going, look, he's sporting.  You're digging this.  I got like six and a half.  He's fooling.  He's fussing with himself.  Jackie Fine.  Why won't you tell us your favorite sexual position?  Yeah.  If I did, I'd have to kill you.  No.  No, baby.  I'll tell you mine.  It's that cowgirl thing where like top and backwards thing.  Nice.  Uh-huh.  I like the way Jackie looked in her book. 
[01:59:00]  I can just picture that propping that ass up.  Look like two fine eggplants next to each other.  Yeah.  Well, it's Jackie Fine, Anthony.  She's Jackie.  Jackie.  You're a diva.  Jackie's a diva.  Are you guys looking at my website?  Yeah.  That's why we're saying she's Jackie.  I'm looking.  Hold on.  Let me take a look there, baby.  Jackie.  Let me see.  www.jackiefine.com.  Jackie Fine dot com or Just Ask Jackie? 
[01:59:30]  Jackie Fine dot com.  Mm-hmm.  Just Ask Jackie.  There she is.  Mm-hmm.  Turn around.  Jackie Fine so I can see how Jackie she is.  Oh, Jackie.  Look how Jackie she is.  Yeah, baby.  That's good.  You got any junk in the trunk?  Jackie, you got some junk in the trunk?  Do you have junk in the trunk?  Me?  No.  But I like a girl with some junk in the trunk. 
[02:00:00]  I like especially a fine African princess such as yourself.  I like her ass to look like about 500 pounds of chewed Tootsie Roll.  And then you just spit it out, mold it into a fine air.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Get me pumping.  What's your favorite position?  I know you guys got to have something more interesting to ask me than my favorite sex position.  Ask Washington.  No, we don't.  Well, you said there's 26 positions. 
[02:00:30]  26.  What if we guessed it?  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Reverse cowboy?  I'm waiting.  Wait.  We'll get three guesses?  Yes.  Is that fair?  Sure.  But you got to play along.  If we guessed it, you got to tell us.  Okay.  And then you get free plugs on the Opie and Anthony show for 18 cities.  Well, actually 17 and Washington.  Mm.  17 and one crime-ridden dump.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm waiting.  Now, now.  Don't take it out on them. 
[02:01:00]  All right, Jackie.  I'm going to start.  Okay.  Find black lady like yourself.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to have to go with Doggy.  Doggy?  Yeah.  No.  Jackie is much more classy than Doggy.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Doggy.  Doggy with the reach around.  No.  Okay.  So that's the first one.  Okay.  What's the second one?  Wait, wait.  No.  You guys.  Yes or that?  No.  I want to hear what the other three is.  Well, Jackie will tell you that Doggy doesn't really reach the good areas on a woman. 
[02:01:30]  That's why you do the reach around.  Oh, that's not true.  Oh, shut up.  It does, but let me tell you, the reach around adds the icing on the cake.  That's right.  Well, Jackie, can I, here's what I'll do.  I'll guess my favorite position, and if it's yours as a woman, it is.  Oh, no.  Here's a wasted guess.  It's not.  I'm going to go for the laugh instead of the guess, Anthony.  All right.  Okay.  Well, yes, that is true.  I'm waiting.  What is it?  I have a few damn spoiled sports.  What's your guess there, Norton? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, my God.  I don't even want to know.  I like it when a gal, this is not even that bad.  Uh-huh.  I like it when a girl lays on her back with her arms folded about mid-chest.  Yeah.  And I can crawl into the box with her.  I think he's talking about some form of necrophilia.  Oh, my goodness.  But I think it also covers the missionary position, right?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  So that would be the second guess, the missionary.  Here's my guess, Jackie.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Any position as long as he got benefits.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what I'm talking about.  I think the third one would be the good one.  Yeah.  What have you done for me lately?  Oh, man.  Valuing your relationships, the power of effective communication?  Yes.  I'm snoozing just reading the title, Jackie.  Jackie.  What?  We got to know the favorite position. 
[02:03:00]  Then we can move on with some more of this other stuff here.  And I was it.  He got it.  Come on.  Jackie, ain't nothing going on but Durant.  I can see Jackie taking that picture on the website and looking at it and just going,  God damn, I look good.  I got to tell you, I look good.  Mm-hmm.  You look like a classy lady.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Jackie, you might be helping out a lot of people out there with your favorite psychosis.  But he guessed it.  Oh, see, you're going with the gag. 
[02:03:30]  No, my favorite position, I don't particularly have it.  I like, you know, a variety.  Like what?  You know, my favorite, one of my favorites would be the reach around.  Ah, yeah.  I mean, that is very good.  But then, you know, I like, you know, variety.  I like to try new things.  Yeah.  Hey, would you ever let a white guy do you?  Have you had any diversity in the races of men that you've had?  Mm-hmm.  Because I hope he's always scoping for a black chick.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Is he?  He ain't getting one, though.  That's a God's honest truth, too.  Well, you know what they say.  What?  The black of the berry and the sweet of the juice.  Mm-hmm.  Really?  Do they say that?  Oh.  Who's they?  Yeah.  And how much time are they serving?  Huddle-a-huddle-a.  You guys are bad.  Ain't that bad.  But you guys don't want to ask me any questions about the videos or about sex other than my  sex life?  You're fat, Jackie.  I am not.  I mean, fat. 
[02:04:30]  Like I like hanging with you.  You're fat.  It's Jackie Fine, Anthony.  She's Jackie.  Your sexual preference is important, though, because if you're writing a book about sex,  what you're about sexually does count.  Not even in a perverted way, but it does mean something if your own sexuality is satisfying.  Who cares?  This is very true.  Now, let me tell you, there is nothing more exciting to a man than a happy, turned-on woman  that he doesn't have to fix, that initiates lovemaking.  Yeah.  No S, Einstein. 
[02:05:00]  That is very attractive to a man.  Nothing better than that reaching down for that crank, huh?  We love it.  Hey, why does the cream work so well?  Why does it work?  Mainly because of the ingredients in it.  A little Bengay or something?  No, it's L-Argining and menthol.  African Yo-Himbi bark?  Hey, I was almost right.  Menthol.  And one of the things that happens when a woman gets older is there's a serious drop in  her libido, and she has a problem with lubrication, and this helps in that area.  Yeah, that's hot.  Oh, no, it's not. 
[02:05:30]  And then the way that it's applied is very fun, too.  Yeah, with what?  A roller?  A fist.  What is a fist?  You rub it in right below the little man in the boat.  It takes about five to 15 minutes.  Sound like my jaunt writers.  Yeah, that's good stuff, right?  So you rub it in, and, you know, something tells me you can rub in water,  and it's going to feel good.  Then she quees and tries to blow on a birthday candle.  How does it work?  It's the menthol. 
[02:06:00]  No, it's not just the menthol, because, you know,  the menthol isn't going to cause her to become lubricated the way that this will.  Find out more.  I'm on your website.  I'm trolling this thing like crazy.  Are you?  You know, your listeners can also ask me questions up there.  You see that?  Can they ask you a question?  Well, we got one of our listeners that wants to ask you a question.  All right.  Let me go to ask you.  I can also give specials on the videos in the Viacream up there.  You see that?  Your website says just ask Jackie.  Yes, ma'am.  So if they want to, what? 
[02:06:30]  Just ask.  That's what I said.  Just ask Jackie.  So we're going to have some listeners ask you a question.  Well, Pete wants to ask a question.  All right.  Okay.  Pete, do you have a question for Jackie Fine?  She's Jackie?  Yeah, Jackie, I want to know if you put a little linda in it.  Oh, God damn, you son of a bitch.  You know, Jackie, our listeners are a bunch of morons, by the way.  Well, you know what?  No, that's something that came up on our show, though, Jackie, and I'm not kidding.  And what was that? 
[02:07:00]  There was a white guy this one time who called our show.  He said that he was dating a black lady, and he told her to put a little linda in it.  Yeah.  Meaning, you know, because you guys got something.  I've been told.  You guys got a little rhythm.  You guys?  What are you?  Opie, what are you?  Jesus.  Take it easy, imperial wizard.  My God.  Uh-huh.  I see.  Have you ever heard that seriously?  No, I haven't.  We had a whole discussion one day.  And a lot of, you know, black-white couples called us and discussed it. 
[02:07:30]  See, that's what it is.  Any porno I've watched that have black chicks in it, man, they are moving that ass.  Like, the guy will be laying down in bed and just moving it.  Like a wave pool.  Yeah.  It's shaking.  Can you move it like that, Anthony?  Mm-mm.  Ain't no white person moving like that.  So you have the rhythm, then.  No, I ain't got rhythm, baby.  What's the talking, man?  Mm-mm.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  So the cream...  You got a question for me?  Well, yeah.  Well, our listeners, you know, they got questions.  Okay.  Oh, look, now your website's getting hit so much that I can't even get to all the things  about the cream.  Hey, Slim Dog said that he tried your product and it worked.  Oh, yeah?  For real.  Oh, yeah.  Slim Dog.  It's some good stuff.  Yeah, what's up, man?  What's up?  How you doing there, Jackie?  Yo, listen, Norton, take a hint, man.  Her plugs work.  You know?  What?  Nice.  Now, yo, that cream works. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  I've used it.  My wife and I have used it.  I wrote you, Jackie.  You sent it.  I swear about it, though.  Try it out.  I'm not playing.  It works.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  What happened to your lady after this cream thing?  Put it like this, though.  It just increased.  You do less work.  That's why it works.  Oh, yeah.  You do less work when you use it.  And any excuse to do less work.  Oh, come on.  Like, you don't try.  I didn't say nothing.  Even he seems like he's not into working anyway, so, you know. 
[02:09:00]  What, me?  This is perfect for him.  I'll get my Frank on, baby.  Let me tell you something.  All right, Slim Dog.  Thank you.  Can I ask Slim Dog a question, mister?  Yeah, go ahead, Norman.  When you put it on the man on the boat, did it get bigger?  Yeah, it did.  Like she said, it took a couple of minutes to work, man.  But, you know, when you're downtown, after a while you notice she's reacting a little  more than what you usually do.  Exactly.  And like I'm saying, it does work.  Your frequency increases.  You know, you don't have to beg as much. 
[02:09:30]  Dude, it works.  So, what percentage do you think that it cut the begging down to?  I'd say at least 35, yeah.  Wow.  At least 35%.  Wow.  You know.  Wow.  Nice.  Man, Jack, you're fine.  Nice.  Thanks, Slim Dog.  All right, now.  You guys suck.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Slim Dog, can I maybe borrow some of that cream?  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Damn.  I'll tell you what.  I'll come down to the studio and drop you all off some tomorrow if you want. 
[02:10:00]  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  All right, Slim.  Later.  Later.  Yeah.  So, Jackie, are we pushing the cream today or the book?  What are we doing?  Or the videos.  Well, your listeners will get a special.  If they order the videos, they get the cream.  The videos are boring, all right?  Are you kidding?  You've got the couples doing it in your videos?  Yes.  There's 26 different positions. 
[02:10:30]  Are you kidding?  That stuff is hot.  Hey, where'd you get that videotape?  I got it from a Negro.  I'm going to send you guys both videos.  Yeah.  I bet you couldn't even.  And I want you to tell me if you can see the difference in the beginning of the first  one and the beginning of the second one.  Oh.  How about that?  I bet you can't even name all the 26 positions.  And I'd be willing to bet you, Anthony, you're going to spot it.  Yeah.  It's something very different.  Do they show close-ups?  Yes, they do.  Is it hardcore?  It's not hardcore. 
[02:11:00]  It's educational.  There's an enlarged view of the female reproduction area.  Oh, is there?  That's all I need.  It's showing you how to touch, where to touch, in order to give you the most intense pleasure  in your partner.  Does it show the man on the boat?  Yes, they do.  Nice.  Any bukkake?  Bukkake.  I'll tell you one complaint that we got.  We got this 70-year-old guy who ordered the video, and he was upset because he says, 
[02:11:30]  I can't do that stuff.  That's gymnastics.  Oh.  Yeah.  He was very upset.  Yeah.  Look at you with the jokes.  Did you laugh and tell him to have a stroke?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right, Jackie Fine.  Jackie Fine, your website's getting pounded right now.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, they probably want to call the 800 number.  Can I get it?  Oh, yeah.  Here we go. 
[02:12:00]  The 800.  1-800-622-8454.  1-800-622-8454.  Can I put that on?  Can I call that on my calling card?  That's 1-800-622-8454.  Yes, you can call it on your calling card.  Anything else you want to get out today there, Jackie Fine?  Well, I'd love to see you guys when I come to New York.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I am dying to meet you in person.  That's what I'm talking about. 
[02:12:30]  Can people order your products, Jackie, from eatabullet.com?  I'm sorry?  Oh, Norton.  Norton's plugging his own website like the whore he is.  He's such a plug whore.  Wait, someone else has a question now, Anthony.  Let me, uh...  Yeah?  Hold on a second here.  Let me do this, then go over here.  And then if I go over here...  You're the tool.  Uh, Adam, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to know, if it doesn't work down below,  can you use that stuff for Afro-Sheen later on?  Oh, stop it. 
[02:13:00]  Afro-Sheen.  Remember Afro-Sheen?  Because I used to watch Soul Train, and that was one of the sponsors.  Thank God black folk figured out a better way to do stuff with their hair  than that Afro-Sheen and jerry curl.  Remember the oil slick that would leave?  Yep.  Well, Jiminy Cricket.  Or Chunk.  Well, no, you can't use it for Afro-Sheen.  No.  Mm.  I bet Jackie's completely shaved, right?  Yeah, right?  Uh-huh, that's what I'm talking about.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  Man, you have the hottest voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I am dying to be in studio with you, Anthony.  Oh, I bet.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, you're shaved down there.  You look like Lou Gossett, Jr., right?  I betcha.  Look like Lou Gossett, Jr. with a hatchet to the head.  With a black eye.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  I'll show you some mayonnaise.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think Jackie needs her cream today.  Yeah.  I'm Big Dick Black.  Yeah.  Okie dokie.  Any more callers?  Well, we're protecting you today, Jackie.  Yeah, we're kind of feeling it.  Because you're Jackie.  I'm kind of feeling it with you.  Oh, so you're going to be nicer this time.  Yeah.  Oh.  I want to be with you. 
[02:14:30]  We don't want to be predictable.  Yeah, exactly.  Just when you think the people have us figured out.  We turn it around.  We flip it.  Mm-hmm.  Jackie, how can we do better in D.C.?  How can you do better in D.C.?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  How can we do better in a city that elected a crackhead as mayor?  Mm-hmm.  That's going to take some work.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  What would you rather hear a guy say to you?  I love you.  I want to make love to you.  Or I take care of my kids.  Or I take care of my kids.  Rhetorical question.  Never mind.  All right there, Miss Jackie Fine.  When are you going to come to New York?  Soon.  Yeah.  You know, my birthday is the day before Valentine's.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Do you have a man, Jackie Fine?  Yes, I do.  Happy birthday.  Mm-hmm.  How hung is he? 
[02:15:30]  Maybe I'll take a picture and send it to you.  Ooh.  Eatabullet.com.  How old are you going to be on your birthday?  Oh, never tell.  Oh, no, huh?  Let me take a look at her picture.  Jackie?  I can't.  The website's being pounded.  I can't even get on it.  Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Can I guess your age when you come in here?  Sure.  Uh-oh.  You know how Opie guesses girls' ages?  How?  He's got to look at their taint. 
[02:16:00]  You know what the taint is, right?  Yes, they do.  Yeah.  I'm five for five, Jackie Fine.  Five for five.  What do you think?  Maybe I won't let you guess my age.  He's got to gaze into the forbidden zone.  He's got to gaze into the forbidden zone.  You know what I'm saying?  Mm-hmm.  So has that worked for you, Opie?  Yeah.  Every time.  Five times.  Every time.  Five for five.  He's five for five, guessing girls' ages.  Oh, my goodness.  Just by looking at the taint.  Man.  Yeah, Jackie.  He's got skills, huh?  He got the skills, man. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My lady, love.  I got a G-E-D.  And a man.  You know, it's amazing that you guys get paid to do this.  Yeah.  Don't tell anyone.  This week.  They're on to us in Washington.  I don't know.  The heck's the other cities aren't on to us.  They're on to us.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Jackie Fine, she's Jackie.  Jackie, we've got to move on with the show.  Oh, you guys don't want to take any more calls?  Well, it's six o'clock. 
[02:17:00]  We're protecting you.  Jackie, let's just put it this way.  It's six o'clock.  Oh, six o'clock.  Damn it.  And what does that mean?  Well, Jackie, we have the six o'clock queef coming up there, baby.  I got it.  All queef.  Do you want to be, uh, do you want to listen in?  Um, sure.  Listen in to the six o'clock queef.  Um, Anthony?  Yeah.  Uh, we don't have any girls standing by to do the six o'clock queef today.  Oh.  By the way, new feature on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  It'll be announced tomorrow. 
[02:17:30]  Yes.  Jackie.  Yes.  Could you do the six o'clock queef for us?  What is that?  You know what a queef is?  No.  You know, I get the feeling I'm going to say no.  Oh, wait.  Why don't we play this?  We'll play the song.  It explains it perfectly.  Listen up, Jackie.  Listen up.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Though out the candles make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef. 
[02:18:00]  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  You get it now?  No.  Damn it.  You really don't?  No.  You never heard of a queef?  No.  Okay.  Look, it's going to be very hard for us to try to describe this to you.  It's not a fart.  It's not a beep.  A burp.  It's not a fart.  Let's just say it's an expulsion of air.  It's a belch?  No. 
[02:18:30]  It's an expulsion of air.  Okay.  That's it.  That's all I'll say.  It's not a fart.  It's not a burp.  It's an expulsion of air, though.  Okay.  It's not a sneeze.  You getting it?  Okay.  All right, Jackie.  Now you know what I'm saying, right?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I want you to do it for us.  Uh-huh.  Let your freak flag fly.  Wouldn't that be great? 
[02:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  What do you say?  Can't do it.  Oh, you can't or you won't.  Can't do it.  Has that ever happened to you, Jackie?  That's a little embarrassing, right?  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great?  So you like that, huh?  Well, it's entertaining as hell at 6 o'clock when a girl calls up and does it for us over the phone.  And hell, it's two minutes of radio we don't have to do every day.  Right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Here, why don't we try...  You can't find anything more pleasing to fill your time?  Jackie, fine.  She's Jackie.  Maybe we can get you in the mood here.  All right, let's hear it.  We've definitely got our fame together.  Oh, yeah.  Isn't that nice?  Come on, Jackie.  I mean, really, when you really sit and say goodbye.  Is it getting you hot, Jackie?  No.  Come on, Jackie.  Put the phone.  Let's hear it.  That was a good one. 
[02:20:00]  Give us a little more, baby.  That's better.  That's better.  You're getting there.  That's the world of my home.  Nobody but you.  You getting it, Jackie?  You understand what we're talking about, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole.  Everyone.  Yeah.  Maybe we can trick Washington into thinking they're listening to Urban Contemporary. 
[02:20:30]  Go on, baby.  What do you think?  I don't think so.  No?  No.  Damn.  What are we going to do?  No girls called up yet?  No.  Come on, ladies.  Ladies, this will be the first day that we haven't had a six o'clock week.  I find that hard to believe.  I know.  All right.  So do I. 
[02:21:00]  Damn it.  Come on, Jackie.  Yeah.  All right, Jackie.  Fine.  She's Jackie.  She is so Jackie.  So you'll come and see us when you're in New York, right?  Yes.  All right.  Dying to meet you guys.  Literally.  All right.  Yeah?  What are you typing, Anthony? 
[02:21:30]  I'm searching for something.  Are you?  Yeah.  More Barry White music?  Maybe.  We're going to give it one more shot.  Jackie.  One more shot?  Yeah.  Of what?  We want you to do the six o'clock queef for us.  I can't do that.  Big Al.  Has it ever happened to you at some point?  Maybe.  Yeah?  I think it's happened to all the ladies.  Or most of them.  Now, one lady's calling.  Come on, Jackie.  Puff it up like Satchmo's cheeks and... 
[02:22:00]  Oh, my God.  Let it loose.  It ain't happening.  The great Satchmo.  You know?  It ain't happening.  Come on.  Yeah, I do.  Has it ever happened to you at an embarrassing time, like when you were squatting down to pick  up an infant?  No.  Holy crap, Jim.  All right, Jackie.  Come on.  I want it to look like Idi Amin belching after a good meal.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:22:30]  Idi Amin, right?  Come on.  Hey, I give it to you.  It would be minty fresh.  Yeah.  You know that?  Aw, yeah.  Because of the menthol.  All right, baby.  We're going to have to let Jackie go.  Yeah.  Let's just try another song, Anthony.  All right.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  I see cleefs.  I see cleefs.  Come on, baby.  We'll get our sensitive sides.  I see them blue. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, you do.  It's following you.  To myself.  What a wonderful cleef.  Yeah.  I see gaseous fumes.  Coming out of you.  The bright blessed day.  What do you think, Jackie? 
[02:23:30]  Any chance?  No.  Can I think to myself?  I don't think it's going to work, though.  I can flatter you, but no.  Cqueef.  Yeah.  And girls aren't even calling to Cqueef.  I can't.  I don't blame them.  All right.  No, we've gotten it every day since we started this brand new feature.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a wonderful feature.  And when did you start it?  Yesterday?  Two days.  Two days.  All right.  It's not like you, you know, had the cream the whole time, either.  You know, they invented it at some point in the Jackie Fine Laboratories. 
[02:24:00]  The laboratories are Jackie Fine.  I'm sure there's a time.  Hand me a goddamn test tube.  I'm sure there's a time you had to use the prison loop.  I'm going to mix equal parts of Kool-Aid and mac and cheese.  Well, see, the wonderful thing about it is that, you know, women who don't even have a problem orgasming, having orgasms.  Or an orgasming.  Can use the cream because it has a more of a major impact on their orgasmic experience. 
[02:24:30]  So, you know.  There's no color on it, though.  It doesn't matter if you're light or dark-skinned, right?  No.  It's clear.  It's not going to look goofy down there, right?  And it's all natural.  Put it on.  Look like a beaver with rabies.  It's not all foamy or nothing.  But when I send you guys the videos, you're going to watch them and tell me the difference, right?  Yeah, and we'll get you back on the phone and we'll give you...  Are you in the videos, Jackie?  Yes, I am.  You are.  Naked?  Sold.  Are you naked or are you just sitting there explaining what's going on? 
[02:25:00]  Tell me Jackie Fine is naked in these videos.  Jackie Fine is naked in these videos.  Are you kidding?  You told me to tell you that Jackie Fine is naked.  You'd be a tease, baby.  You're there just with the pointer.  No pointer.  She's hot sitting there with clothes on and Estorol is demonstrating.  Christmas Day!  Christmas Day!  What's up, son?  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I know how to raise your ratings in D.C. and get her to queef at the same time. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah?  You got to play some fila cooties.  You like the fila cooties?  You like the fila cooties, Jackie?  Africa 70, Egypt 80.  I remember.  Africa 70, Egypt 80.  You know that?  What is fila cooties?  I know the struggle, Jackie.  What is it?  You don't know?  It's a band.  Okay.  So you're like a guy and he's a singer and there's some good music to F by.  Really?  Fila cooties, baby. 
[02:26:00]  Like I would know good music to F by.  Do you have some of this?  Sweet Home Alabama when I was a kid.  Do you guys have some of this?  Earl's got it down the hall there.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Thank you.  So you can't play any for me?  No.  We're going to let you go.  Well?  We're kind of bummed you didn't do the 60 o'clock.  Yeah.  I understand.  Now it's 609.  I understand.  Well, maybe, you know, in studio.  All right.  Come on.  Suck up a bunch of air.  Make it look like Dizzy Gillespie.  Two trumpet players.  Well, let's hear it for Jackie Fine. 
[02:26:30]  She's...  Jackie!  Jackie!  Yeah, baby.  Good job, Jackie Fine.  Thank you.  Come see us soon and send those videos, all right?  I will.  I'll send them out to you today.  All right.  There she goes.  Jackie Fine.  Bye, Jackie.  Bye.  Bye-bye, Jackie.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, you sound a little hot.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I bet you're sweet like Mrs. Butterworth.  Right?  I bet you.  Pour you out. 
[02:27:00]  I pour you out.  I like pouring out Mrs. Butterworth.  Get her ass up in the air.  Pouring that syrup out.  I like mine with syrup.  See that nice, calmly brown ass just turned clear?  As you're pouring out the syrup.  The syrup.  The syrup.  Oh.  Yeah.  Hold on, Anthony.  Hold on.  Megan.  Yeah.  What's going on today, Megan?  I can queef for you all. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Jackie.  Thank you.  See you later.  If we wasted enough time, we'd get one.  Thank you, Jackie.  Kind of toss you aside.  Thank you, Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  There she goes.  There she goes.  All right, Megan.  What's going on?  I look good.  I just had to park my car because you wouldn't be able to hear it without the car.  All right, where are you calling us from?  Chillicothe.  What?  Ohio.  Oh.  Of course.  We're supposed to know this stuff.  I know local residents.  All right.  Let me.  You want to hear it?  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to play the intro.  All right. 
[02:28:00]  It's not a burp.  It's not a burp.  It's not a burp.  Hold on.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  She's Jackie.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  I love you.  All right, Megan.  On the side of the road somewhere in Ohio, it's all yours, baby.  Let's listen.  Submit.  Oh, a very different sound today. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sort of double-barreled.  Yeah, me and my boyfriend went at it earlier.  That's why it's kind of.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Megan.  Wow.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  Yeah, it's not too tart.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles.  Make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's six o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Tense up and let yourself roar. 
[02:29:00]  Queen.  Beautiful.  And with that, we'll be back right in.  Peace.  Anthony.  O.B.  You guys are done.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.

[02:30:30]  Ratings in Washington, D.C.  Much less gooder.  We're in 16th place overall.  Thank you, Washington.  Ouch.  An exact quote from the general manager, Ken Stevens.  I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster.  Ah, well.  I'm still trying to figure out what he meant by that.  There's got to be something.  You're still trying to read into that, right?  Yeah, there's got to be some weird little thing he meant by that. 
[02:31:00]  Looks to me like two bad apples are spoiling the bunch.  Dilly Plaza did more for JFK than you two are doing.  Oh, God.  Wait, all of a sudden it's you two, right?  Dick.  Nah.  Buffalo ratings tomorrow.  Yeah.  Full report at three tomorrow.  Good, bad, or indifferent.  You want a quick little thing on why we're doomed as a nation again?  Yeah.  Fifty Taliban and Al-Qaeda detainees are at Guantanamo Bay in a little prisoner of war camp we constructed over there on one of our military bases. 
[02:31:30]  Human rights groups complain that the detainees have not been given prisoner of war status and are being treated poorly.  They're being treated poorly.  Did you see where these people came from, first of all?  Living in caves, in dirt, their own crap.  We upgraded their lifestyle.  Yeah.  They say they're being forced to shave in violation of their religious tenets. 
[02:32:00]  And to live in cages open to the elements.  And this is a bad thing.  If U.S. soldiers, for example, were held in open mesh cages covered with a tin roof, I think the U.S. government would complain about it.  No.  We would bomb the living crap out of whoever was holding them.  Unfortunately for them, they don't have the resources.  You can't put these people in, like, if I could bring up Hogan's Heroes, in nice little barracks like that. 
[02:32:30]  There's too many things they could do.  You need to have a constant watch on these animals so they're put in cages without walls so they can constantly be looked at, what they're doing.  Because look at what happened in that little camp that they had in Afghanistan when they were given two seconds to group up and do something.  They killed people.  That's why they're in cages.  Because they act like animals, then you treat them like animals. 
[02:33:00]  And these human rights groups should be thrown in right with them.  Don't worry.  They know what they're doing holding these people the way they are.  Thank you.  Doomed as a nation.  All right.  Anthony, we put our foot in our mouth again.  How do we do that?  We don't know how to talk to national publications.  I think, you know something?  I'm not going to be so hard on ourselves.  Really?  By gum.  Wait for your quote.  No, you know why? 
[02:33:30]  And I know you have an explanation, but wait for your quote.  They screw with us, just like Time Magazine did.  With me.  What do you mean Time Magazine?  I didn't get over that.  I didn't get over that.  Time Magazine screwed with you how?  The guy from Time Magazine.  Now, this was very exciting for us.  Those of you that were with us at the time, remember how excited we were that we were going to be in Time Magazine.  Finally, a publication, not like swank, that I could take over to Mommy's house and say, 
[02:34:00]  Look, Mom, here it is.  You're boys in Time Magazine.  Isn't that nice?  It's kind of cool.  You know, look at how well I did with myself.  I have a quote in Time Magazine.  Well, we sat with the interviewer, use the term loosely, for hours.  For hours.  Talking to this guy.  He's asking us questions about the show and everything under the sun.  And we're answering him.  And I believe that I'm being pretty forthright with my answers. 
[02:34:30]  And what does he do?  What quote did he put in?  Right before he left, we walked into our office where you will find a picture, a big poster of the Olsen twins.  Very outdated poster at this point, by the way.  But, you know, it was right when they really start looking hot.  They start sort of looking like they're, you know, you could picture that they're really going to be hot.  Right when they turn the corner.  Yeah.  Toward womanhood.  So, I turn and look at the poster because we've talked about the poster a lot in the air. 
[02:35:00]  I go, yeah, that's the poster of the Olsen twins.  Look at that.  I go, they're getting so hot.  So, you could tell that Mary-Kate's the prude and Ashley's the goer.  Out of everything I said to that son of a bitch the whole day for Time Magazine, that is the quote he put in.  You can look it up for yourself.  That's the only quote I get in the whole article is, boy, those Olsen twins are getting hot.  Mary-Kate's the prude, Ashley's the goer. 
[02:35:30]  And I'll say it, Anthony, I'm a very intelligent person on this radio show.  That's the one.  So, there it is.  My one publication that we were ever going to get in that I could show my family, and it's a pedophile quote.  It's a quote about pedophilia.  So, it's not so much what we say, it's how these people print it and what they choose to print.  So, now, I try not to say much of anything to these people. 
[02:36:00]  I'd say he captured you pretty well in one sentence.  Right?  I didn't disagree.  Fine interviewing.  Enough of your bunk.  He just got you in one sentence.  Well, the February issue of Details Magazine, which I believe will be on the newsstands next Tuesday.  Thank you, Rick.  There's a whole article on pretty much man's junk.  You know that new ad for Calvin Klein's little cute underpants? 
[02:36:30]  Calvin Klein.  I like the word underpants.  Underpants?  No, they put out what amounts to guys' panties.  Yeah.  It's like a very small bikini type brief, but it's a ball bag.  It's supposed to make you look bigger because the whole front is a yam bag sack.  So, when a girl looks at it when you're in your underwear, it looks like your yam bag is your schlong.  And it gives you a little support.  It pushes it all forward, it looks like. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Right?  It's like everything is being pushed forward, so your whole unit is just hanging out.  Well, it's bad enough to look at it on a page in Details Magazine, but the billboards all over New York are huge.  Look at this.  Yeah, there it is.  The guy might as well just be naked.  Holy yes.  Golly, that's a mouthful.  Wait, Aaron's going back to the time thing.  Aaron.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony, you know, if you've got to quote yourself, if you've got to do this correctly,  Mary-Kate's the Pris. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  Not the prude.  Mary-Kate's the Pris.  Ashley's the go-in.  Thank you.  All right.  I seem to have forgotten the quote.  Jackie Fine's got a problem with the...  Well, we've got to get to the underwear, then.  I know.  All right.  Let's see what's wrong with Jackie Fine.  Jackie, what's the matter?  Jackie.  You guys have fired my website.  What do you mean?  My web guy just called complaining that he says that you're going to get these types of hits.  We're going to have to talk because no one has access to the website now. 
[02:38:00]  He says, look, you're going to have to call the radio show back and tell them.  They need to find out information.  They've got to call the 800 number.  No one can get on the website.  Give the number real fast.  Pretty good plug.  1-800-622-8454.  They're going to have to call 1-800-622-8454.  They want information on the videos or the cream because the website...  Or they're going to have to wait.  All right, Jackie.  Get on.  Jackie, whoever did your site stinks.  You should have got the fine folks at Accurate Imaging. 
[02:38:30]  We're going to start charging you.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you now.  Well, you know, they're going to have to give me their telephone number.  There's a bill in the mail for you.  Yeah, because I tell you.  I mean, it's like it's fried.  It's like there's...  I can't even get on it.  Like fried chicken?  We have plenty of...  Oh, my God.  We've got so many listeners, Jackie.  See that?  You know, I find that so hard to believe.  Yeah, that's good.  So many people want to see a picture of Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  All right, baby.  Okay, guys.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Can we get back to the details thing?  I thought she liked it.  So it's a whole...  Awful, man.  It's a whole article on this Calvin Klein ad and the new underpants.  Underpants.  Underpants.  It's just such a fun word to say.  They're briefs.  We should do a whole bit on fun words to say.  Underpants.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Sure.  What kind of fat, boring fraud would call them underpants?  I'm not fat.  My underpants. 
[02:39:30]  Stop it.  All right.  So they asked us for some comments.  They want us to take a look at this ad.  But this guy is junk.  And tell us what we thought.  Tell them what we thought about the ad and about junk.  I must say, we don't come across too good in this article.  No?  I thought we said a lot more than these quotes, but these are the quotes they decide to go with.  But usually the way.  All right.  We'll start with what I had to say, Anthony.  Uh-huh. 
[02:40:00]  Are women really checking out our package?  Wonders Greg Opie Hughes.  Greg Opie Hughes.  I used to do a radio show as Greg Opie Hughes.  And then your consultant said it.  Said one or the other.  One or the other.  Make it either Greg Hughes or Opie.  And I chose Opie.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Co-host of Opie and Anthony.  The guy-friendly radio show that's popularized such male genitalia euphemisms as yambag, mule, and junk.  Now it's mine.  Ooh.  Let's move up.  Hughes winces. 
[02:40:30]  It's like a European swimsuit, he says.  Every time I see a Euro swimsuit, I think fag.  Oh, look at that.  Here we go again.  Oh, boy.  Europe now.  The whole of Europe, not just France.  And here's the quote that I'll have to live with for a while, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  His own underwear, Hughes reports, covers up a world of hurt.  What the hell does that mean?  Your underwear covers up a world of hurt.  A world of hurt.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:41:00]  Anthony, it's not much better for you.  Uh, this is Anthony.  We need a wonder bra for junk now, adds Anthony Cumia, Opie's partner.  Yes.  We're partners, Anthony.  Hey, partner.  Not partner.  Pardon-er.  Pardon-er?  Like the old West spelling.  This isn't good for you.  I think your quote's worse than mine.  You say, we need a wonder bra for junk now, adds Anthony Cumia, Opie's partner.  Then you take it off and the chick gets all disappointed.  I was not talking about myself, my friend. 
[02:41:30]  Who, who?  I was saying that, like what?  We need a wonder bra for the junk now?  It's ridiculous.  My statement there is how ridiculous that is.  If somebody needs a wonder bra for the junk, then they would take off this wonder bra for  your junk, and the girl's going to be disappointed.  I was not speaking of myself and your junk and my junk.  Yes.  All right.  Your girl will be disappointed, and yours sees you're coming up a world of hurt. 
[02:42:00]  You guys suck.  I know.  Don't ever talk to magazines again.  Mary Kate's the price, and Ashley's the goer.  That's why I like kids, because it looks bigger.  You never sound good in magazines.  Little tiny little fingers.  That darn cord is pesky.  Oh, yes.  Pesky.  Did you just say pesky? 
[02:42:30]  That's great.  Sure.  Sorry, I'm pesky.  Hey, Gene.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Gene, author of the details article.  Hey.  Gene.  Gene, it's Ian.  Ian's.  Oh, is this the end?  Yeah.  Spiegelman or Spiegelman?  Spiegelman.  Who wrote that fine article in the New York Magazine?  That's me.  Hey, what's up, bro?  I got no problem with the quotes in this one.  We actually, I couldn't understand what you guys were complaining about.  No, no complaining.  You know what? 
[02:43:00]  I just realized that it was you that interviewed us.  Did you just realize that now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're so wide awake.  I know.  I got no problem with that.  I said, like, the one that brought for the junk is kind of a silly thing.  What was supposed to be silly?  The article doesn't really take this thing seriously.  No.  So that's what we were...  I mean, I kept you on the phone for, what, three minutes?  Yeah.  It was a quickie.  It was a...  Do you have tape of what we said?  No.  I just typed it up while you were talking.  Oh, all right.  Really relevant. 
[02:43:30]  The whole article, please.  It's so September 10th.  Thank God for once...  I mean, really.  Thank God for once the interviewer could figure who was saying what.  I don't want to be quoted as having the small junk like Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I want to be quoted like mine is covering a world of hurt.  It was funny.  My God.  The small with sores on it.  A world of hurt.  That is funny.  A world of hurt.  It was memorable.  Goofy little subject.  It's fun.  It was...  It's like a...  What is it?  It's a one-page article. 
[02:44:00]  It's not a big deal.  Right.  It's funny.  And don't worry about it.  Okay.  We're just making fun of ourselves because we really look silly.  At the time, we thought it would be cute to say the things we did.  And now we realize how a lot of people are going to be reading this.  I think they would read it as funny.  Okay.  Good.  Well, okay.  Well, thanks a lot.  Thanks, Ian.  All right, there, Ian.  All right.  Later.  You're the man.  Thanks.  All right.  So that's the latest issue of Details Magazine out next Tuesday.  There you go. 
[02:44:30]  Your wonder pants, whatever.  I said, wonder bra for the junk.  I think you know what I meant.  It's supposed to make your junk look bigger than it really is, which I think is a little  odd because if you...  To the point where you're in your underwear, they're coming off.  Then the girl's going to see, hey, what I thought was junk was yam bag.  Then you're in trouble.  Right.  Because you want to take a tamping rod and put that whole thing in. 
[02:45:00]  A little rough.  I have a little yam bag.  Do you?  Yeah.  It go with your hairless body?  Yeah, it really does.  A little awful alien body.  Does it look like a little clam?  A little clamshell?  Are you kidding?  I have a little bag.  I have a little bag.  It's true.  Okay.  It's just too much.  I surely, surely did that one another.  Oh, the beautiful package is all mule.  It's all mule.  Well...  My roommate, on the other hand, it looks like his mule has Down syndrome. 
[02:45:30]  It's all bag.  Florentine is all bag.  How do you know this?  He's showed me 40 times since I've known him.  That's cute.  That's interesting.  Absolutely true.  I went home and there was a photo, a little photo of his mule taped to my door.  This is a little weird, man.  No, it's not gay.  Believe me.  Of course not.  Pictures of your roommate's junk on your door. 
[02:46:00]  And I fell face first against it.  It was an accident.  Fine, of course.  Well, why don't we come back and play what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  All righty.  And more words that are fun to say.  Like underpants.  Underpants.  I bet you can't come up with one, Jimmy.  Oh, I don't know.  We'll see.  I'm going to challenge your improv skills. 
[02:46:30]  Stopping you from the mansion has prepared you for this.  I don't want them enjoying it like exactly.  Sometimes you want to hear.  Why?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Come on, Washington.  Get down with the sickness.  Oh.  It's time to play what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Yeah.  Tomorrow, more details on the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[02:47:00]  Naughty Nighty.  New feature debuts tomorrow.  Yep.  And Buffalo ratings come in tomorrow.  Look at us with features.

And he also learned, I have never seen a bigger ratings disaster can be taken in the ones of ways.  Ah, all the chicanery that went on today, huh? 
[02:49:30]  Chicanery.  That's great.  Carla.  Hey, guys.  First of all, I want to say that we think you're the cat's pajamas here in New York.  Yes, thank you.  Second thing I learned is joint ratus gets a woman going.  Yeah.  Joint ratus.  Thank you.  You got it.  I don't want to cross you two because I know inside my bread is buttered on.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Terry.  That's right.  I learned today that when Anthony was a kid, he used to have sex to Sweet Home, Alabama.  There you go.

He said, Norton doesn't care about some douchebag in 50 years doing a book report. 
[02:51:30]  Ooh, good.  Jody.  Hey.  You still love Chachi?  No, shut up.  How many times have you heard that?  About a bazillion times.  Bazillion.  And it just doesn't get funnier.  Yes.  Baz.  But, okay, so I learned that Washington's problem is that they have a bee in their bonnet.  And I had one suggestion.  How did we miss that?  What's that?  How did we all miss that one?  Oh, and I had one suggestion for spicing up the show for Washington. 
[02:52:00]  Yes.  You should use a little hair of the dog that bit you.  Hair of the dog.  Thank you, Jody.  Thanks a lot.  Bye-bye.  A bee in the bonnet was great.  Ooh, Andrew from Philly has a good one today.  Andrew.  Yeah, today I learned that D.C. is not your brand of comedy, and fine men of black women  don't queef.  Yes.  Thank you, Andrew.  Thank you.

Time to grow that hair in.  Big Mike, what's going on?  O&A, what's up, man?  Hey.  I learned that the Amish has better ratings than O&A in the afternoons in Washington.  Yeah.
