<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them. The show opened with a scathing critique of Mike Tyson's underwhelming fight against Kevin McBride, focusing on Tyson's apparent lack of effort, stamina, and financial woes.  Audio clips of post-fight interviews were played, reinforcing the hosts' commentary.  The discussion included comparisons to other past-their-prime athletes and speculation regarding Tyson's possible medication use.  A caller added to the financial discussion, highlighting Tyson's significant tax and creditor burdens.  This segment transitioned into a discussion of the many new interns joining the show, with the hosts expressing their typical cynicism and humorous, often crude, expectations of them, referencing past negative experiences with interns like Ricky, and detailing their somewhat unconventional interview process conducted by Ben and Steve.  The hosts also joked about the interns' initial enthusiasm and predicted their inevitable disillusionment.  The upcoming appearance of Jim Norton on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was mentioned, along with Bob Kelly filling in for him. A caller suggested a "cat fighting" pay-per-view, prompting a brief discussion. The use of peer-to-peer file sharing for copyrighted content and a mention of the "AIDS song" from Family Guy rounded out this section.

The next segment heavily featured Bob Kelly, who filled in for Jim Norton due to a knee injury sustained in Vegas.  A clip of Norton's Tonight Show appearance was played, showcasing Norton's self-deprecating humor regarding his body image and dating life.  Kelly then detailed his own recent knee injury, humorously describing the incident (involving tight jeans), his subsequent pain, and his use of Vicodin and other pain medication.  A significant portion focused on listener-submitted remixes of Kelly's pained cries of "I broke my knee, man!" set to various songs, including Led Zeppelin’s "Immigrant Song" and *Goodfellas* music.  These remixes were extensively discussed, with the hosts and Kelly adding commentary and further details. A new intern, Harry T., was introduced as the creator of some of these remixes.  The conversation briefly touched upon a past incident involving the hosts, Bill Burr (who was present in the studio), and the comedian Bernie Getz, where they playfully antagonized Getz.

The show then segued into recounting two chaotic in-studio events. The first involved a guest named Bernie (possibly a mayoral candidate) who became enraged after Opie smashed his CD, leading to a physical altercation involving Bernie, Opie, Anthony, and Eric, who was used as a human shield.  The incident was recounted with humorous exaggeration, including racial humor comparing the reactions of white and Black people to threatening situations. The second event was a series of stories about the hosts' often debaucherous vacation misadventures, focusing on encounters with women, alcohol consumption, and sometimes resulting in the emotional distress of those women. One story involved a guest throwing poker chips at a woman who gave them gifts, causing her to cry and leave.  Other stories detailed encounters in the Caribbean and Mexico, containing crude, sexually suggestive humor, descriptions of casual sex, and observations about cultural differences and perceived dangers outside resort areas.  Bill Burr and Bob Kelly were in studio guests for this segment.  Various prank calls were also incorporated throughout. The segment included audio clips from a "Sexiest State in America" bit, featuring sexually explicit listener calls.

The show continued with a lengthy, sexually explicit discussion of pornography, followed by a segment detailing the roommates' unsanitary living conditions, particularly one roommate's disgusting habits.  The discussion then shifted to the Puerto Rican Day Parade, focusing on arrests, vandalism, and the alleged behavior of some participants, interspersed with comedic tangents including running jokes about a roommate’s unusual dietary choices (a cow's face and a giant snail).  A substantial portion involved an intern, Sam, being sent on a mission to acquire a specific video game for Anthony.  Various news items were discussed, including a Family Guy clip, a child with a brain tumor, and a segment mocking a mayor’s speech impediment. Bill Burr and Bob Kelly were again present in the studio, along with a brief appearance by Pat from Munaki, a competitive eater. The discussion of the parade and sexually suggestive comments about parade-goers continued until the show ended with a listener call.

The final segment began with a discussion about a competitive eating contest involving "salty balls" (boiled potatoes) in Wildwood, New Jersey, with a $2,500 prize, discussing the potential for participants to get sick and the involvement of the IFOC and EMS. This transitioned into a discussion of a previous eggnog drinking contest on the show, where a diabetic guest vomited after consuming 70 double shots.  A comedic song about "salty balls" was played.  A caller, John from Colorado, recounted a Bill Burr stand-up performance, praising Burr's skills and sharing a joke about a Yankees fan.  Dave Chappelle's return to stand-up and a potentially offensive t-shirt were also mentioned. A news story about a 78-year-old man setting himself on fire prompted a discussion about its absurdity.  Opie shared a personal anecdote about a childhood trip to a motel owned by a man who died from smoking in bed. The show concluded with more audio clips of Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, interspersed with further discussion, including a story about a comedian in a wheelchair, and plugs for upcoming shows by Bill Burr and Bob Kelly.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perfect and...  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back!  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down  Syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  I have a problem with the fact that there's no air in here and I'm going to die. 
[00:04:30]  Open the door now.  I'm suffocating.  The air is on.  Chris, you have no idea.  I can't take it.  Check, check, check.  Just give me a fan.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, I can't even think to answer a question.  Can I offer you my interview question?  Just give me a fan. 
[00:05:00]  Give me a fan.  I can't take it.  I can't think to answer your question.  Everyone's looking around going, who the hell was that?  That was Madonna, believe it or not.  She's from Detroit.  Yeah.  Yeah, can you believe that?  It was Madonna?  Getting ready for some kind of Q&A and they're setting up the microphone.  And she's like, I need a fan.  I need a fan.  I can't take the heat.  Where the hell does she think she's from?  She didn't used to talk like that. 
[00:05:30]  When she was singing Lucky Star.  I don't think she spoke with that little inflection.  We're beating up the CD player because I want to play it again.  I think I got it stuck in there.  What happened?  They're still using these old Denons.  I used these Denons 15 years ago.  Why haven't they updated CD players for a radio station?  Back in the old age.  When these Denons came out, it was all the rage.  Oh my God.  You could jump up and down in the studio.  Nothing's going to skip on you. 
[00:06:00]  Smack them.  You could bump into the machine while it's playing and it'll keep playing for you.  You won't go, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Drop in your carts on your record album.  But it's still the same fucking thing 15, 16 years later.  My God, man.  My God.  You'd think they'd come up with new ones.  Well, here's Leaker.  Now that you know who it is, let's play this again.  It's Madonna getting ready for some Q&A.  I have a problem with the fact that there's no air in here and I'm going to die.  Open the door now.  I'm suffocating.  The air is on. 
[00:06:30]  Chris, you have no idea.  I can't take it.  No idea.  Just give me a fan.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, I can't even think to answer a question.  Can I offer you my interview questions?  Why, give me a fan here, governor?  What the hell?  I need a fan.  A fan. 
[00:07:00]  Fan, man.  I can't even think, yay?  I can't think.  I'll fucking cock it.  She's fucking from Detroit.  Yeah, Detroit.  Detroit, Michigan, yo.  Not England.  I know she lives there most of the time now, but let's calm down.  London, Detroit.  It kind of sounded like Orson Welles.  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Why is no fun?  I did it right.  Right.  In the frozen fjords.  Madonna.  I was kind of sounding just like that today, because it's already 80 degrees in New York. 
[00:07:30]  It's going to go up to about 98, which is just insane for the New York area.  Why?  Well, then I walk into the studio.  It has to be...  Look, everyone's kind of shivering.  It's like 60 tops.  Yeah, it's freezing in the studio.  I think it's like 55 degrees in the studio right now.  You need, like, jackets in the studio.  So I...  You need a Speedo outside.  Yeah.  So I made a little note for myself.  Bring in the long-sleeved shirt tomorrow.  Yeah.  Long-sleeved shirt, and it's going to be 100 tomorrow. 
[00:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  Like, why can't they figure out air?  Oh, boy.  This is going to be tough today.  Why?  What happened?  I...  How...  How can I do the show looking in at new faces peering in at us?  Yeah, there's a lot of...  It's a little odd.  A lot of new go-getters.  New go-getters today, and it's going to be a little difficult with them standing against  the back wall peering at us.  You got it easy, because you don't have to look that way.  I'm looking directly at...  Why didn't they put curtains on that window? 
[00:08:30]  There's Travis.  There's a familiar face.  He's the only one I recognize in that whole room.  Oh, Nathaniel, I sort of...  Oh, yeah, Nathaniel, I recognize as well.  The other guy that sits there.  I told Ben no eye contact for the first month for these guys.  No eye contact.  One of the guys was sitting on my freaking couch.  I'm like, what?  When we came in...  I thought it was some young new comedian that was going to do the show today or something.  Sitting on the couch.  It's an intern getting comfortable.  Walk in, legs crossed.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey, hey, what's up? 
[00:09:00]  What's this?  What's this guy?  His attitude will change within weeks.  He'll be miserable like the rest of the interns.  You watch.  Well, he's got to be beaten down first.  He's that young horse that's just running around the plains wild and free.  Got to put a bridle in his mouth and slap a saddle on him.  Oh, he has no idea, man.  He has no idea.  I wonder if there's any diamonds here.  Do you think there's any diamonds in the rough?  I don't know.  A couple of them.  You never know.  You never know.  You never know which one's going to turn out to be the hero and which one's going to... 
[00:09:30]  The one that looks like a terrorist is already running around like crazy from copy machine  to computer to newspapers.  He's clipping.  He's copying.  He's downloading.  So-so.  Al-Qaeda.  The Al-Qaeda guy is pretty cool, I guess.  Yeah, but that might not work out, having them stand behind the...  You want to move them?  If they could stand way to one side or way to the other way, it's not in my line of vision  until we know them better. 
[00:10:00]  What's up, Steve?  Steve's all happy already.  Martini Steve, everyone.  Steve.  We're just assigning these guys to their new posts.  Yeah.  It's overwhelming having this much help.  It's a little strange.  We don't know what's going to do with them.  Yeah.  I mean, like, we're actually putting them to work, but we haven't had this many people  helping in months.  I said it's like the first day of school.  It smells like school bags and lunch.  And they're all like...  They're all psyched and...  Right. 
[00:10:30]  Remember that?  You had all your books and notebooks and pencils and...  You walked down the hall and your pants go...  Yeah.  And then, like, a couple of weeks in, you got a piece of paper and a pen.  Right.  Well, know what it is.  They're the new students and we're the old, grumpy teachers.  Oh, I know.  We just are looking for retirement.  Ah, we're the teacher's lounge drinking coffee, bad-mouthing everybody.  Right.  This sucks.  Another crop of assholes.  Same old shit.  Little fuckers never understand what it takes. 
[00:11:00]  Faces are the same.  The names just change every goddamn semester.  Same, though.  They're all the same.  Anthony and I have had easily over 100 interns in our career at this point.  I can name maybe two.  Two or three, and they're here.  The others email us every once in a while.  The others are all Rickys.  Right.  They're all Rickys.  Which one of these is the next Ricky?  I don't think you're going to have a Ricky in this bunch.  No?  I'm very optimistic.  Wow, Steve is very confident in the new batch. 
[00:11:30]  We had a good model to follow in Ricky as to what we didn't want.  As to what you don't want.  So basically, if they worked for Wackbag, you said sorry.  A message board guy that shows up in appearances will not be made into an intern.  Sorry to the gang at Wackbag, but Ricky blew it for all of you.  Ricky ruined it for every single guy on Wackbag that thought he might have a shot at it being an intern.  Yeah, that was one of the screening questions that Ben and I asked.  So, do you take part in any of the websites that are associated with this show? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  Goodbye.  Yeah, goodbye.  Goodbye.  Yep.  That's it.  It needs to be said that Ben and Steve interview all these interns.  That's got to be a little intimidating for the interns.  Steve sees sitting there, Ben, with his huge hog that they have to just stare at.  No, it's actually a very laid-back thing.  Ben is very casual.  That's the problem.  Ben's laid-back, and this thing is, you know.  No, well, you're there for everyone to see.  Oh, Jesus.  I notice when we leave sometimes, when we leave the show, some of the intern prospects are sitting outside by Paul's office. 
[00:12:30]  It is so uncomfortable because I open the door, and, like, before I even see you there, I'm like,  take it easy, Paul.  I'll see you, you know, tomorrow.  And the intern prospects sitting there, and they look up and see who it is,  because I guess there's been people walking in and out throughout the time they've been sitting there,  and they see it's either me or Opie, and they look like, oh!  Well, they get this shocked look, and the fans are like, oh, that's wonderful!  Oh! 
[00:13:00]  And I feel ridiculous.  I was like, hey, how you doing?  You know what I do?  I'm cool, too, and I'll say hey and all.  I don't say a word to them.  I walk right past them.  And then I hit the sidewalk, and I call either Steve or Ben and go, eh, eh.  Don't have them sitting there while I walk.  No, even worse, because, like, they'll be, the guys that are.  Oh, you give the thumbs up or thumbs down.  Just by the high.  Just by the high.  And how they're dressed usually.  Oh, you're horrible.  Because some of them come in suits and stuff, so I'll go down the sidewalk, I'll go to bed, 
[00:13:30]  and Steve will go, nah, nah, don't even waste your time.  You know the guy that was in today?  Nah.  Anyone that wears a suit for an internship, nah.  They look up, and, like, I guess there's been people walking in and out during the time  that they've been there, so at first they're just kind of looking.  You know, it's a normal reaction, and then they see it's either me or Opie, and their face  makes that, like, oh, oh, they look, but then they kind of look away because they don't  want to look like they're staring, and it's all uncomfortable and awkward.  And then you feel that they're staring at your back as you're walking around.  I know. 
[00:14:00]  That's why I pick my ass.  I dig in deep with a finger.  And then smell it.  Yeah.  Could you smell this and tell me if I'm sick?  Ben, are you happy by the new guys?  Yeah, well, you should have seen some of the guys be rejected, if you know.  Really?  Yeah.  There was one time I couldn't, Steve had made some comments before, and so had Eric, so I  had a real tough time not laughing every five seconds at this poor guy.  I felt like a dick, but the guy was just a, you know, he was a train wreck.  Yeah, it was a little bit of a mess, and just surprised me.  He's not on board.  Yeah, well, if you wanted another Ricky, we could have had him. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Easily.  There were plenty of other Rickys that applied, and, you know, there were guys who were, Ben  and I know what the wrong answers are to the questions that we're going to ask.  Right.  Some of these kids would answer every question wrong.  Oh, the one guy, we had one that was just, I just couldn't stop laughing at him because  Steven made some comments before he came in.  I'm like, from now on, don't say anything until they come into the room, because I couldn't  stop laughing at him.  He's answering everything the wrong way.  And I'm just like, I had to get up and leave.  You're in the message woods?  Yeah, yeah.  I post all the time. 
[00:15:00]  They call me the guy that can't shut up.  I post anything.  One guy's like, he said how many posts he had and everything.  He's like, oh, great.  I got 180 posts.  I got 180 posts.  There's 180 reasons he won't be an intern.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't get that whole post count on these messages.  Oh, dude.  It's like a hierarchy.  I don't get why that's so important.  It is.  Because it shows.  There they go.  Yeah.  The Ben and Steve show.  Our screeners.  It's very important.  It shows that you're dedicated to the message board. 
[00:15:30]  And you're better than a guy that has five posts.  Because you have like 2,000 posts.  A guy that has five posts, too.  How could you take him seriously?  He's only got five.  He could be spelling out the cure for AIDS, cancer, everything else in those five posts.  But he's a tool because he's only got five.  If you got 2,000, don't fuck with him.  He's the man.  And it seems to be an intern prospect.  Wouldn't that show that you have no life?  And that you're really not the man?  Oh, P.  Well, the higher your account is.  You have a life?  The higher the account is, it seems to me, that would be a bad thing. 
[00:16:00]  There's a life there.  It's a life of posting on message boards.  All right.  It's a little rough.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we should start with the Tyson fight.  Oh.  Saturday.  Mike Tyson.  Fought some big Irish guy.  I don't even know his name.  That's what a draw this guy was.  Kevin McBride, I believe.  Hey, Kevin McBride.  The weird thing is, no real buzz about the fight.  Usually, usually, like in the old days, only a few years back, a big fight like this, 
[00:16:30]  you know, you'd get a lot of people, you know, paying for it.  Still pack the...  I'm trying to burp and talk at the same time here.  Still pack the arena out there in D.C. where they had the fight.  Yeah, but see, that's what I mean.  D.C. instead of, like, Vegas or what have you.  Oh, yeah.  The whole thing just didn't sound good at all.  Well, after the last fight where he got knocked out, you know, people were like, eh, what am I going to do?  Why do I want to see the old Tyson?  But people bought their tickets.  I bought the pay-per-view.  You know, I knew it wasn't going to be a Tyson fight of old, but can't miss a Tyson fight. 
[00:17:00]  And it was just, it was sad.  It's the only way I can describe it.  You know, we goof on a lot of things that are supposed to be sad on this show, and we make jokes about it.  Yeah.  This was really sad.  Did you feel sorry for Mike Tyson?  God, that's so weird.  Totally.  Like, it's like the old dog that you had, you know?  You remember him when he was a young fetch-in-the-stick doggy?  And now he's just matted and always stinks and has the mange and can't walk and waiting to get kicked in the liver by Opie. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  Rubbing his ass on the living room carpet.  I've got to rub my ass on the carpet.  My ass itches and no one will scratch it.  Well, first of all.  I just hold my legs up, my feet by my ears, and I drag myself with my front feet and scratch my ass.  It was just sad.  Well, first of all, what happened?  He just quit after six rounds or something like that? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, he was, first of all, this guy manhandled him.  He just, he was too, he was too big for Mike.  Mike, old Mike probably would have bust out, rushed right at him, and knocked him out.  That's the old Mike.  This Mike, forget about it.  He can't, he doesn't have that devastating blow anymore, so he's got to stand with these guys and fight him for a while.  Usually, you know, five, six rounds.  So he's standing there, and the guy's manhandling him.  He kept grabbing Mike with one arm and punching him in the face and doing uppercuts with the other. 
[00:18:30]  And it was taking its toll on the guy.  He's leaning all of his weight.  This guy's huge.  He's leaning his weight on Tyson, and Tyson's having a hard time.  He's getting tired.  After the first round, he went back to his corner.  He was exhausted.  One friggin' round, three minutes.  Was the guy training?  He's, you know, he's 38 years old.  Some guys, they got stamina after that.  This guy, just, it's gone.  Yeah.  The old Mike Tyson is gone, replaced with an old Mike Tyson. 
[00:19:00]  Just, so the fight went that way for a few rounds.  He got a couple of good punches in the face.  He got a couple of good punches in, but the big guy wasn't going down, you know?  The old Mike Tyson would have been able to knock him out.  Couldn't do it.  So Mike knew he was getting tired.  He started getting punched in the head a few times and really started getting wobbly.  So back to the corner in between rounds.  He gets out for the next round.  I think it was the fifth, and he's frustrated, really frustrated. 
[00:19:30]  You could tell.  He tried to break, what was his name, Kevin?  Kevin, yeah.  He tried to break Kevin's arm.  He grabbed the guy's arm and put it in the crook of his elbow and then pushed down on his hand.  And Kevin starts going, he's like, ah, you know, getting the ref over here.  He's breaking my arm.  Tyson's biting his gloves the entire fight, too.  He put his gloves up by his face and bite his thumb of the glove before he would throw punches. 
[00:20:00]  I guess trying to intimidate the guy.  Then he just went in with his head.  Went in with his head, hit Kevin above the eye, starts bleeding.  They delay the fight a little bit while they check out the cut.  And that was just desperation.  That was Tyson thinking, you know, I'm getting my ass handed to me.  I have to end this fight somehow.  So he went dirty.  He got pushed down and couldn't get back up.  Got pushed down, fell on his ass, hit the ropes after getting hit in the head a few times. 
[00:20:30]  He looked up at the ref like, could you give me a hand up?  And obviously the ref isn't allowed to help the fighter up.  But it wasn't ruled a knockdown, so they couldn't count him out.  So they gave him time to stand back up.  The round ended.  He went to the corner.  And that was it.  He was like, done.  Said, no, can't continue.  No moss.  So the corner just said, no, he's done.  And that was the end of Mike Tyson.  During one of the interviews, right after the fight, he said he just doesn't have the stomach for it anymore. 
[00:21:00]  Doesn't love it, doesn't even like it anymore.  Thinks more about his kids and his life than he does about fighting.  And I think that's been the case for a while now, for quite a while.  Oh, of course.  It's been all about the money.  He said, people ask him, well, why'd you do it?  He goes, to pay my bills.  That's the only reason he's been in the ring for the past few years.  That's it.  The guy wasted a lot of time and talent in prison.  Yeah, can you imagine if he just kept fighting in his prime? 
[00:21:30]  A lot of these guys take their talent for granted.  And during their prime, they go off and do something else.  Michael Jordan's a classic example.  Decides to quit.  Play golf.  And play golf.  And then baseball.  Might only be baseball for a while.  And you're like, what are you doing?  Stop.  Like we talk about on this show all the time, time is a bitch.  Time always wins.  Yep.  So why are you wasting the prime of your career doing something else?  Because you're bored.  Because someday you are going to be older going, why?  Did I do that?  Yeah.  You can use it while you got it. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  And especially for an athlete, by the time you hit upper 30s, 40 especially, you're done.  So you still have your whole life ahead of you.  Some guys got it up into their 40s in some sports.  Not many.  Some guys, late 30s.  I mean, you got Clemens who, you know, he's playing for a team that can't get him run support.  Or he'd be like 10 and 1 at this point.  Messier was playing hockey at like 40.  Ali, well, I think Ali fought when he was like 40, I believe. 
[00:22:30]  But Tyson, you know, 38 years old, you take somebody like George Foreman.  Foreman was fighting at 38 years old.  Oh, yeah, he was.  He was kicking some ass.  Yeah.  You know?  Tyson just doesn't have it.  He had that.  When he had his youth, he'd run out there.  I mean, I would pay 50 bucks for a pay-per-view to just look at old clips, highlights from Tyson's fights.  I would buy that.  Let me see his fight. 
[00:23:00]  I want to see him beating the shit out of people.  You know?  You get a pay-per-view to just see this old guy.  And I was telling Hope on the way in, it's like you can't see any difference between Tyson now and Tyson then visually.  He doesn't have a head full of gray hair.  He doesn't have wrinkles.  He doesn't have flab.  He doesn't have a big beer belly or anything.  He's pretty much still got it.  He looks like Tyson did years ago.  So it's hard to look at him like that, see him come out, and get his ass kicked. 
[00:23:30]  You're so expected.  I was sitting there going, come on, punch the guy.  Knock him out.  What's your problem?  You know?  You can't be tired.  You're Mike Tyson.  You'll look great.  But no, the guy didn't have the stamina, doesn't have the heart, and just got his ass kicked by a nobody.  By a guy that just is nobody.  He's a big, like, bruiser that should have just been on the canvas within the first round.  That's over, obviously. 
[00:24:00]  Let's go to Dan in Jersey.  Dan, what's up?  You guys are hypocrites.  You guys took a long-ass break.  I know.  We were in prison.  ONA took a break in their prime.  But we had no choice.  You kidding me?  You don't think every day we were off the air that I was thinking about that?  That we were wasting time?  We were on top of our game when we got fired.  Mike didn't have a choice in the prison time either.  That's true.  Hey, when does Ron and Fez come to your station?  We don't know.  Working on it, Popeye.  Yeah, we don't know what's going on with that whole deal at this moment. 
[00:24:30]  Thank you, sirs.  All right.  No, I mean, if it was up to us, we wouldn't have taken a break when we were.  I think we're still in our prime.  But, you know, we had to take two years off at the worst time in our careers.  At the worst.  It's a little different than boxing, too, you know?  It's like, obviously, the show has grown from the time that we hooked up at BAB and did  WAAF.  You know, we were spinning records, you know?  Playing music for the young people.  And then the show grows, you know? 
[00:25:00]  Right.  You're able to change and adapt as you get older.  But it's not like, you know, boxing.  It's not like if you're old and don't have the stamina, there's nothing you can do.  So, you know, I don't think there's a senior's boxing that he can go into, you know?  That's what I mean.  Especially boxers.  It's a short shelf life.  Very short.  You've got to make what you can.  And besides being in prison, you know, Tyson wasn't fighting, you know, that often when  he wasn't in prison.  And you've got to think as a fighter, you know, the years are just clicking off quickly  in your brain going, well, how many years can I really do this in my prime? 
[00:25:30]  He was surrounded by some of the worst people you could be surrounded by as a boxer.  And this is something that's happened to other fighters in the past all the time.  They end up destitute, these guys, because they have a few good fights under their belt.  They made a lot of money.  And they get these guys that just spend all this guy's money.  Over the course of the time that he should be fighting and making more money, he's living  off of, you know, a couple of fights he does one year or every two years or something 
[00:26:00]  like that.  Yeah.  And he's got these vultures just spending all his money.  Poor bastard.  Well, we've got Anthony from Oceanside.  Anthony, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Morning, man.  Anthony, happy St. Anthony's Day to you today.  Oh, thank you.  And what the fuck is your problem, man?  It's Kevin McBride is the heavyweight champ of Ireland.  Did you listen to anything?  Did you know about it?  Yeah, the heavyweight champ of Ireland.  Boy, did he seem like a...  Yeah, but the Irish could fight.  You know that.  Of course they can.  This guy should have been bleeding, though, in the old days. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, but you notice when he first woke up, he was fucking drunk.  He had a good drink before he started to fight.  Dude, the guy is probably the dumbest individual I've ever heard speak.  Oh, Kevin McBride?  Kevin McBride.  He couldn't put a sentence together.  They're asking him stuff, and he's like, hey, well, he's a legend.  We're into a fight.  It was a good fight.  And champion, Ireland.  That's great.  I was on it.  Quite a legend.  Yeah, big bag of hammers. 
[00:27:00]  Walking bag of hammers.  Fucking retard.  All right, Anthony.  Thanks.  Let's go to Paul.  Maybe I didn't take Tyson off his Zoloft thing.  Yeah, maybe he was still on the dope.  But you hear about the passing of $5 million, $2 million of which went to his creditors, $750  grand went to his ex-wife, and pretty much the rest went to the IRS.  So he got nothing.  He got nothing.  He's just trying to pay off his bills, and last fight, there was a big hype about Tyson 
[00:27:30]  coming back.  He's going to be fighting.  He needs to pay off like $10 million.  And the last fight was like his launch into this bill-paying fighting he was going to be  doing.  When that really went badly and he got knocked out, people were like, that's it.  The guy can't.  If he can't win, he's not going to draw people in to pay to see him fight.  Sure.  But there was one more.  It was this fight.  If he would have won this one, perhaps he might have been able to. 
[00:28:00]  Now there's no way.  How is this guy going to pay his bills?  It's going to get really sad from this point on.  Yeah.  It's requiem for a heavyweight all over again.  It's going to be another one of those disasters.  It's going to be in an Indian costume and WWE ring.  Not many fighters, you know, get to retire with all their money and their senses.  Nope.  I mean, it's just a train wreck.  George Foreman is like an example where he was able to, you know, get out and make something  of himself later on with these stupid grills. 
[00:28:30]  Do you remember Greg Page, I think his name was?  He was supposed to be like the next Ali back in the day.  He was another one of these guys that had to come back and fight.  And now he's like pretty much like half paralyzed in a bed somewhere, drooling on himself because  he just got the crap beat out of him in the ring.  Wow.  Has no money.  And he was supposed to be the next big thing back in the day.  You know who went a little too long?  A million of these guys.  You know who went a little too long?  I mean, he's doing well for himself announcing for fights and stuff.  Sugar Ray Leonard. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  He was probably one of the most articulate boxers I'd ever heard in his prime.  Sure.  And he went just a little too long.  And you hear him speak now.  And, you know, he kind of slurs his words and can't quite get him out quickly enough.  And it's sad.  These boxers just get their heads pounded in.  And they don't know when to leave.  That's a business where if you think you should be leaving, you should be leaving.  It's already too late. 
[00:29:30]  Exactly.  Let's go to Justin in Tampa.  Hey, Justin.  Hey, dude.  I was watching the fight the whole night.  And they actually had Tyson up for like the fifth round.  The sports side round.  Oh, yeah.  The score had Tyson up.  He was winning on the cards.  Yeah, they had him up by like four points.  One guy had him like 45 to 41 or something like that.  That just shows you what a sap the guy was that he was in the ring with.  This Kevin McBride was the worst.  Tyson was winning.  But he ran out of steam.  He just lost it.  He had nothing left. 
[00:30:00]  He was going to get knocked out if he came back out.  Yeah.  Did you see the Layla Ali fight?  How about that girl?  Oh, the chicks fighting?  Oh, the chicks.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she's crazy.  I still can't get into the chicks fighting thing.  Yeah, it's a little weird.  It's a little strange, yeah.  All right, punch it out.  All right, but she won a couple titles or something, I guess.  Yeah.  All right, whatever.  Chick fighting, stop it.  Chris in Jersey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, yeah.  They should have cat fighting. 
[00:30:30]  That's something everybody would watch on pay per view.  Cat fighting.  Real like, make it like the...  Yeah, there was a cat fighting league.  We had them in the studio once, remember?  Extreme fighting championship.  Ripping their clothes off and pulling hair and scratching each other.  That would be something.  I want to see cat fighting.  Little blood scratch marks.  Yeah, you get the girls out there looking like the guys.  You know, everything is, you know, pushed down.  Yeah.  It's like...  Yeah, I know.  Why are we watching chicks fight? 
[00:31:00]  No offense to the ladies, but I don't get it.  I don't get that.  I really don't get that.  Not the boxing.  Yeah, cat fight.  Cat fighting.  Saw one online.  They got a few of them online.  And you go to some of these video sites, and there's one.  I guess it's pretty new on the web.  Or at least it's new to getting a buzz on the web.  Two chicks.  Looks like high school girls.  Maybe even junior high.  In a backyard with a bunch of people around.  And they're just going at it.  They're fighting.  And the video camera's rolling.  And they're just pulling hair and scratching, punching the shit out of each other. 
[00:31:30]  And they're both hot.  Really hot.  Ultimate cat fighting.  Yeah.  Great stuff.  You have a whole thing where they're getting their makeup on before the fight.  Yeah.  And their hot little outfits.  Little schoolgirl suit.  The little skirts.  And not allowed to wear bras.  That's the type of thing I want to see.  When that blouse button.  When the blouse buttons go.  Yeah.  Just rip them right off.  Ah!  Then I would know who the champion is. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  That's what I want to see.  I'd be able to tell you all the stats.  Chris in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I just want to hear.  Since Tyson is basically dead.  I want to hear Tyson voice from Ant with the Bill's dead girl.  Woman.  Old woman voice.  And go.  Yeah, exactly.  I lost the fight.  You're kidding.  Yeah, exactly.  What are you going to do?  Well, maybe we could get a remix together on that one. 
[00:32:30]  Leroy, North Carolina.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  I was basically watching the fight, but all weekend long on the Fox Sports Network, they  played Beyond the Glory on Mike Tyson.  Oh.  Kind of ironic showing him back when he was with Gustav Amato in his start.  You know, at 18, how tenacious he was and what a great fighter.  And then they'd take it all the way through to just the meltdown and all the interviews.  And every time he went crazy and acted like an animal, it was incredible. 
[00:33:00]  When he would come flying out of that corner early in his career, when that bell would ring for the first round and he'd come flying out of the corner, there wasn't one fighter on the other side of that ring that wasn't petrified and you could see it in their face.  When a fighter stepped in the ring, it was like you could see in their face, oh my God, I'm in the ring with this animal with Mike Tyson.  And he would come bolting out of that corner, just punching this guy in the face until he fell down. 
[00:33:30]  And that was it.  And then to see him, you know, Saturday night, exhausted after the first round, six rounds later, just giving up sitting on a stool.  That's sad.  Yeah, throwing a towel in instead of wearing it.  You know, when he used to come in the room with those black shoes like Patterson and the cut towel just hanging around his neck.  Yeah.  Just unbelievable.  And people would look just like there's a gladiator walking into the Coliseum, you know.  But they interviewed him like this, Beyond the Glory. 
[00:34:00]  You guys should try to check this out.  He's got some great lines where he's like getting interviewed by women.  He says, I don't get interviewed or I don't allow women to ask me any questions unless I'm fornicating with him.  And he just goes off the deep end.  Hawk, Beyond the Glory.  Get on it.  We need that one.  All right.  And I think, Anthony, one last thing.  I think you asked.  You would pay 50 bucks to see Mike Tyson, all his greatest knockouts from pay-per-view.  Yeah.  You can go on like Kazaa or Imesh.  I think somebody put it all together. 
[00:34:30]  You can download it and just watch him just dismantle all those just ridiculous fighters.  Yeah, I need to get a virus computer.  I need to get a computer in my house that I don't care what kind of virus it has.  So I could use Kazaa and things like that because I tried it once and, man, it took me so long to clear out my computer with Trojans and spyware and all kinds of crap.  So I'm going to have like a computer.  I'm going to call it AIDS.  I'm just going to call it AIDS.  It's going to sit in the corner. 
[00:35:00]  I'm not going to be connected to any of my other computers.  And it's just going to be the virus.  There's going to be like shankers on it and oozing pustules coming off of it because I won't care about viruses.  It'll just be for Kazaa and porn sites and everything else.  I got a song for your AIDS computer.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex, but you hear. 
[00:35:30]  It isn't clear, but what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  For full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry, I wish it was something less serious. 
[00:36:00]  Body change.  You've got the AIDS.  Ah, there you have it.  The highlight from Family Guy last night.  The AIDS song.  Family Guy was funny last night.  Yeah, I mean, I'm getting a lot of shit from a lot of people still just because after the second or third episode of Family Guy, I wasn't digging it.  Yeah.  You know, obviously the show has its moments.  And last night it was funny.  Yes, it was funny. 
[00:36:30]  Maybe.  It was funny last night, okay?  Relax with this.  You know something, Obi?  Maybe from the time that they were on the air and very popular to the time they were taken off the air to the time that they got back on the air, maybe they needed a little time to get up to speed.  Maybe their first couple of shows weren't really representing the talent that they had and the comedy and the fun.  They had to get back into the rhythm.  Into the rhythm of things, into the swing. 
[00:37:00]  Because I don't think you could just jump back on the air.  Right.  I mean, jump back having a cartoon like that.  You've got to get used to your surroundings.  Your surroundings, your back together again.  The new offices, the new people you work with.  Right.  The new go-getter interns that are running around.  So, you know, thinking like you were thinking, they should have been funny right from the first show.  Yeah.  You look back at that first show and go, that should be as funny as any show that they did.  You're 100% right, Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  They're getting up to speed.  I think they are.  God, but one stupid comment I made about a month ago.  People are killing me still.  Yeah, they are.  It's like, all right, I get it.  The show was really funny last night.  A lot of fans.  But that's funny about a computer that you use just for the dumb stuff.  Just for viruses.  Not even touching.  The other computers shun it.  You don't put it on the network.  Nothing.  Yeah.  That would be a great idea.  Because I can't use Kazan, and I want to.  There's a lot of great stuff on there, you know, videos and music, anything. 
[00:38:00]  But I just refuse to go.  You're so tempted, too.  You know, your computer, you get on there and start going, I could load that program up again.  And your computer says, no, no.  And, you know, this is a very interactive radio show.  Yeah.  So I read a lot of the email that comes in for the program.  And there are people, like, they sent the 8th song a million times, all our fans and listeners, whatever.  They're really helping out and sending stuff to us all the time.  And I don't even, if it has a file. 
[00:38:30]  Nothing.  No.  I just reply and go, send it to Steve.  Yeah.  Send it to Steve at foundrymusic.com.  I'm not even attempting to download anything on my computer anymore.  I won't open anything.  Because I got screwed royally.  I had to get rid of my last computer because I got some kind of virus I just could not get rid of.  Sometimes you just got to throw the computer away.  I'm not even kidding.  A couple people came and checked it out.  Eric was one of them.  And he's like, dude, this thing is done.  Just pull it off a life support.  Slowly but surely it was getting eaten away by little tiny little viruses, little infections.  No big deal.  But then I got the wham! 
[00:39:00]  AIDS.  Done.  The full-blown AIDS.  Eric's like, you just have to get, just throw it away.  Yeah.  So, you know, I don't know this computer shit like someone like Steve.  So I don't even attempt.  I'm like, send it to Steve.  Nope.  Just send it to Steve.  Don't even bother me with this.  Don't open anything.  And I'm tempted.  I see, like, Family Guy AIDS song.  You know, and I didn't get to see Family Guy until, you know, this morning.  I'm like, ah, no.  I want to hear an AIDS song from Family Guy. 
[00:39:30]  But I couldn't, you know, attempt it.  I run it through McAfee.  And that's usually pretty good.  I got that.  I got a bunch of the stuff.  You run the files through there.  It's usually pretty good.  I still don't trust it, so.  And then keep up to date with the viruses.  I guess the latest one is one that's labeled Michael Jackson Confesses.  Oh, that's right.  I was reading about that over the weekend.  It's like Michael Jackson Confesses, it says.  Mm-hmm.  And you click on it.  You know, you open it up because you want to read his confession.  And bam, you got the AIDS.  You got the AIDS on your computer. 
[00:40:00]  Your computer starts getting the sniffles.  And you're like, what?  Yeah.  What?  But to the new listeners that are getting up to speed, any files, anything you want to  send the show, audio-wise especially, you've got to send it right to Steve.  Steve at foundrymusic.com.  Dell sells a little robe to put over your computer.  A little friend's visit.  If you're just got the AIDS.  All right.  I was going to play the Tyson clips before we move on here.  Oh, right.  Yeah, we got some.  He's always good to say something after these fights. 
[00:40:30]  I noticed very subdued Mike Tyson.  And none of the, you know, all praise be Allah.  He doesn't say that anymore.  Yeah.  And he was just, he wasn't even trying to make excuses or anything.  Just flat out saying, I don't like doing this anymore.  That's it.  You think he was on the medication for the fight?  Because there was a time they used to take him off his medication so he could be just  an animal in the ring.  Yeah, that's probably, that probably has a lot to do with it.  His age, the fact that he probably is on medication and realizes it's for his best, it's in his 
[00:41:00]  best interest and his family's, you know, his children's best interest that he stays  on this medication.  Yeah.  And I think it takes a lot out of him, physically and mentally.  You know, cigars and scotches on the line here.  I was just thinking about this as well.  Because I can't picture a guy that's built like him, that works out like that.  You know he trained for the fight.  He didn't just, I can't imagine that in three minutes of one round, he's going to be that  tired.  If it isn't something else, maybe a medication that he's on, or something that took this 
[00:41:30]  guy's endurance and just completely eliminated it.  Yeah, he's 38, but he's not, you know, 48.  You know, the guy in that kind of shape, with that kind of body on him, should be able to  go a couple of rounds and not be winded.  You would think.  Cigars and scotch, what's up?  I know it's a tired genre of television, but who the hell wouldn't watch a Mike Tyson  reality show?  Just make sure he must speak.  It's the only way he could pay those bills, too.  Yeah, that's a reality show I would love to see. 
[00:42:00]  You start filming today.  Mike Tyson's life.  Today.  Wow, that's good, yeah.  And what is he going to do next?  And show the bills coming in, and show his whatever, advisor saying, look, dude, you're  a five, six, whatever it is, million in the hole, and then try to get his life going,  the second stage of his life.  That would be very interesting TV.  Hello, would you like fries with that?  Please drive around.  Yeah, would you like an apple pie?  Okay, I'm done with my day at work. 
[00:42:30]  I make $120 a week.  I got $5 million to pay.  Let me do some mathematics.  This is going to take a long time.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, what's he going to do?  Get a job somewhere?  That's the reality show.  I'm a greeter at Walmart.  Hello.  Right.  I'm Mike Tyson.  Yeah, what's...  Well, come back.  What do you do at this point, you know?  What do you do?  What do you do? 
[00:43:00]  Poor son of a bitch.  Maybe talk to George Foreman.  Ah.  He did well with the grills.  Maybe, you know, something...  Let me sell some of your grills.  Yeah, maybe Tyson could come up with some kind of grill or closing line, right?  All right, here's Tyson after the fight the other night.  Self-explanatory, I do believe.  I'm just sorry I let everybody down.  I just don't have this in my heart anymore.  Oh, that was him in the ring, right?  Yeah, that was the first thing.  He was sorry.  He let everyone down.  He just doesn't have it in his heart anymore. 
[00:43:30]  And you could just see it.  You could just see it when he walked out there.  And like I said, you've seen it in prior fights to this.  He just doesn't have it anymore.  Didn't have that drive.  I had a tiger.  Didn't have it.  It's so weird with me.  There was a time growing up I hated Ali.  Hated him.  I thought he was so cocky.  Really?  I hated him.  And then when he got older, that's when I really started really liking the guy and rooting for him.  Big time.  I mean, big time.  And I do this with a lot of the older athletes. 
[00:44:00]  There's a time I hate them in their prime, especially if they're kicking your team's ass or what have you.  And then they get older, and for some reason you start to turn and you really start rooting for the guy.  And I remember when Ali was in the ring and he didn't have it anymore or his skills were drastically diminished.  That's when I was really into him.  When he was more in the underdog position.  And so I kind of like that with Tyson.  You want him to do well at this point.  I was yelling at the TV.  I'm like, come on, Mike.  Punch him.  What are you doing? 
[00:44:30]  Get out.  Don't let him hang on you.  Yeah.  The guy was, Kevin McBride, was just grabbing Tyson around the back of the shoulders or the neck.  And then taking his other hand and just uppercut right to Tyson's jaw and the side of his head.  And he wasn't able to really get a good swing because they were really close together.  But it was enough where it was just bop, pop, pop, pop.  Kept punching him in the head like that.  And it took its toll on him.  Yeah.  Some of those body blows, though, from Tyson, that's the worst part. 
[00:45:00]  You'd watch Tyson lay a couple of body punches in on McBride, and it reminded you of Tyson from years ago.  You know, it was enough of a reminder where it made it that much worse to see him that bad.  If he just went out there and looked completely bad, it's one thing.  But a couple of these body punches, you're like, oh, God, that's got to be devastating.  Yeah.  Well, let's play guess what word he mispronounced in this next one.  Okay.  All right.  Most likely I'm not going to fight anymore.  I'm not going to disrespect the sport anymore by losing to this caliber of fighters. 
[00:45:30]  Caliber.  We're fighting this caliber of fighters.  I've got a 50 caliber.  And this is probably the saddest thing he said after the fight.  I don't have that ferocity.  I'm not an animal anymore.  Yeah.  He's not an animal anymore.  He doesn't have the ferocity.  Ferocity.  I don't have the ferocity.  I don't have the ferociousnesses.  Who is this? 
[00:46:00]  The ferocity.  Ferocity.  I hate when that happens, when you lose your ferocity.  And he's not an animal anymore.  Not an animal.  Unfortunately for the viewing public, he apologized.  Actually, in one of the clips, I think he says he wishes he could give the people their money back.  Because, you know, people spend some good money to see it.  And you end up seeing Tyson sitting on a stool.  And that ends the fight.  You know, it's a little anticlimactic. 
[00:46:30]  This is a great idea.  Rick in Philly, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right, buddy.  We've got a remake, Raging Bull.  Showing back Robin Gibbons around a bit.  You know, opening a nightclub in Miami and mispronounce things all over the place.  Yeah.  Do a stand-up routine.  The couple.  Yeah.  Can you imagine?  All right, Rick.  Oh, my God, I'm out.  All right, good job.  All right, let's, we have more clips.  Him at the press conference after the fight?  Yeah.  I didn't see this one. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, I'm not interested in fighting no more.  Listen, I'm not trying to take anything from Kevin McBride.  We know his record.  We know his credentials.  And if I can't beat him, I can't even beat Junior Jones.  Wow.  Junior Jones?  Who's Junior Jones?  No one even knows who Junior Jones is.  I can't beat him.  Okay, here's a little more.  I'm comfortable with my stigma here.  I know who I am, and I know what people think about me.  Listen, I may be bizarre sometimes, but I'm very rational.  I'm extremely rational, and I understand my situation here. 
[00:47:30]  I understand my situation now.  I understand the situation of this country, and I'm not going to lie to myself,  and you shouldn't allow me to do that as well.  You shouldn't allow me.  I'm rational.  Did you see me trying to eat my glove like it was a chicken?  That's rational.  When he was ripping Evander Holyfield's ear off, he was rational about it.  That's rational.  When I step in the ring with a boxer, and I try to twist his arm off,  that's rational. 
[00:48:00]  When I realize I get my ass kicked, so I take my head,  my big coconut head, and slam it into his eyeball, that's rational.  No, he still has that bit of craziness in him.  He just doesn't have the physical makeup to back it up anyone.  Sometimes people think I'm not handling my responsibility.  I may not want to spend as much time with my kids, but I have to be happy.  I don't want them to be around me, and I'm not happy.  I need to be happy, and the only way I'm happy is when I'm contributing. 
[00:48:30]  Keep them happy.  Imagine those kids.  Oh, God, make Dad happy, please.  You know what he's like when he's unhappy.  Man, fast forward a year or two.  This is going to be a really, really sad story.  Oh, yeah.  Really sad.  Just go look into my missionary work.  There was some Christian missionary work that would be interested in letting me come to Bosnia,  go to Rwanda, and just go to various different countries to help with aid and food  for people that are in dire need.  Oh, my God.  No, they're giving him applause break.  He's going to be an aid worker for Africa? 
[00:49:00]  Well, that's something.  There you go.  Yeah, that's a nice thing.  And then SportsCenter did a great little feature, top ten Tyson clips of all time.  Ooh.  I believe, like, audio of him speaking and stuff.  Yeah.  Let's take a listen to some of this.  The reality is I'm never going to be normal.  But you want to be.  Yeah, but it's never going to happen.  I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy like that.  You know what I mean?  I might want to have sex in a crazy place, but I don't want to kill or rape nobody or hurt nobody. 
[00:49:30]  You have to say that.  I'm from Brownsville, Brooklyn.  I'm not afraid of nobody.  In the ring or out of the ring, they got a gun or a knife, and I'll show him that, too.  Mike, you're jumping around.  You seem to be a little anxious.  I'm just ready to get it on and crush this guy's skull.  What do you do, Mike, over the next two days?  You've got 48 hours before this fight.  Yes, pray he doesn't die of a heart attack.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, man, I can't wait until the 28th.  I'm going to make you my girlfriend. 
[00:50:00]  And you think I give a damn about you and your other?  I don't care about living or dying.  I'm not no, I'm not going to dysfunctional.  I want to blaze.  Yeah, bring Andrews a lot on.  Bring those guys.  They can keep their title.  I don't want their title.  I want to strip them of the health.  And I know I got my issues.  I'm belligerent.  I'm sometimes vicious and violent.  But that's just because of what happened.  Yo, anybody, look at my life.  Look at me.  I've been embarrassed, humiliation, degradation, and any other T.I.O.N. you can name. 
[00:50:30]  It's negative, right?  Jimmy Swaggart is lascivious.  Mike Tyson is lascivious.  But we're not criminally, at least I'm not criminally lascivious.  You know what I mean?  I may like fornicating more than other people.  It's just who I am.  I sacrifice so much in my life.  Can I at least get laid?  Come on, you f***ing coward.  You've got men in the f***ing with me.  You can't last two minutes in my world, f***ing.  You're scared now, you f***ing. 
[00:51:00]  Scared like a little f***ing.  Doesn't matter what I say, your guys, it doesn't affect you guys.  Your guys don't care about nothing but money.  So every now and then I kick your f***ing and stomp on you  and put some kind of pain or inflict some kind of pain on you  because you deserve to feel the pain, somewhat of the pain that I feel.  If I wish one of your guys had children so I could kick them in the f***ing head  or stomp on their f***ing, so you could feel my pain  because that's the pain I have, waking up every day.  Where do you go from here, Mike?  I don't know, man.  I might just fade into Bolivian, you know what I mean? 
[00:51:30]  I don't have nowhere to go and nothing to do, you know what I mean?  I just go fly my pigeons on the roof in New York.  Fade into Bolivian.  Fade into Bolivian.  Wow.  You could hear it in his voice in those earlier clips.  Oh, yeah.  Like the rage and the want to get in the ring and beat up people.  And then you could hear kind of fake rage, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like the last one with Kevin McBride.  He said, you know, I'm going to gut you like a fish.  Yeah.  That was his big line.  Yeah.  And he said it like, you know, 
[00:52:00]  I'm going to gut you like a fish.  Huh, huh, huh.  This is, you know, the old Tyson was full of fire.  He will be missed.  All right.  With that, we'll take our first break.  Little Jimmy Norton's not here today.  He's going to be on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  That's huge for Jim Norton.  Very huge.  Um, yeah, that's something, man.  We're hoping to get it.  It's going to be so nerve-wracking.  I can't imagine.  Because I know Jimmy.  He's a little bundle of nerves. 
[00:52:30]  What's that like standing there?  And I know how nervous we get doing dopey shows.  Dumb stuff, right.  You know?  And to stand there backstage, Tonight Show, Jay Leno intros, your music starts or whatever it is.  And you've got to walk out.  And you know it's The Tonight Show?  Mm-hmm.  Whoa.  That's too scary.  Too goddamn scary.  This is his second time.  Yeah.  So maybe he'll be less scary.  Who knows?  I don't know.  I don't think it gets any less scary.  And I guess he got stuck in the middle of a gay pride parade or something. 
[00:53:00]  That's right.  Yeah, L.A. Gay Pride.  He got hotels right in the middle of it.  I got stuck in the middle of it.  Yeah, sure.  And then all of a sudden I turn around and there was a dick up my ass.  Right.  What are you doing?  You've got to pump back.  He's stuck.  So we're trying to get a hold of him.  I mean, he's not in bed yet.  Or maybe he did try to sleep normally.  20 dicks in my mouth before I made it to my room.  To get ready for The Tonight Show. 
[00:53:30]  We have his appearance from the last time?  We can go to break with that.  That's kind of cool, actually.  Filling in for Jim Norton today, we've got Bob Kelly coming in.  And Bob Kelly's never heard his Bob Kelly remixes, by the way.  So we'll play some of the better ones for him.  And also a good friend of the program, Bill Burr, also stopping by to say hi.  Right.  And hopefully we'll get Jim Norton on the phone to see how he's feeling before the big night.  And then I think he's not going to be here tomorrow either because he's got to fly back.  He's got to fly back, but he'll be back Wednesday?  Wednesday, I believe, yes.  All right.  Very good. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  In the meantime, as we go to break, here is the last time Jim Norton was on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  How cool is that?  Check this out.  All right.  My name's Chris, a talent comedian, a regular panelist on Comedy Central's Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn.  He'll be on Opie and Anthony's show every day on XM's satellite radio starting October 4th.  Please welcome his first time on The Tonight Show, Jim Norton.  Thanks, everybody. 
[00:54:30]  How are you?  Good.  I feel a little odd.  I've been depressed.  I had a three-year relationship and, yeah, I was with the same girl for three years and  I started to have erection difficulties.  Yeah, we had different ideas as to what the problem was.  She bought me Viagra.  I bought her a treadmill. 
[00:55:00]  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I'm all about compromise.  I'll eat a pill.  Just get on the machine, you monstrosity.  And to answer your next question, yes, I realize that I'm not a visual treat.  You ever look at yourself nude in a full-length mirror and you want to fall on a knife?  I am awful-looking naked.  From the waist up, my body looks like a scallop.  That's what I look like.  Picture a scallop with bee cups.  I have the type of breasts you read about in a Judy Blume novel. 
[00:55:30]  Budding and curious.  You ever have a moment of clarity about your awful torso?  I took a hot shower once.  And you know how after a hot shower, even after you towel dry off, because of the steam  in the room, your body still has a glistening sheen to it, which on some body types is very  alluring and attractive.  However, on this body type, it looks like you were involved in a sex crime. 
[00:56:00]  So I go to put on a t-shirt.  The t-shirt I'm wearing right now is an extra large, very comfortable.  The one I had this day was a medium, and it was made of rayon.  So I know I'm in trouble.  As soon as I get to my shoulders, you ever have to start rolling a t-shirt down over my  breasts and down my rotten torso?  And it grips all of my fat, and it wraps around my body, and I'm naked below the waist.  I look like a mushroom.  And I realized at that moment, if I had a gun, I would have shot myself right there 
[00:56:30]  in the bathroom, and it would not have even been necessary to leave a note.  Cops would have showed up the next day, found my headless torso.  Wonder why she did that.  See, women think they're the only ones with, like, body issues.  Men have them, too.  I hate going to the beach, because no matter how hot it is, I have to wear a t-shirt.  I was in Cancun for spring break this year, and I don't know if you can tell under these 
[00:57:00]  lights, but I don't tan particularly well.  I have the complexion of a urinal.  So I'm in Mexico.  It's 110 degrees on the beach.  I'm wearing a long t-shirt I have on Sunblock 45.  I'm holding an umbrella like some bisexual Mary Poppins.  I'm creeping out all the college girls.  You know, where do you go to school, ladies?  And it was so depressing to not hook up down there, because all the girls are beautiful 
[00:57:30]  and they're drunk.  I don't drink, but I like girls who do.  I'm not one of these annoying, self-righteous men.  You know, I don't like a girl who's too drunk.  I don't know what too drunk is.  I've never seen it.  I hear a girl going, nobody loves me.  She's halfway to where I need her to be.  It is amazing what I will tolerate on a date. 
[00:58:00]  You ever have this dilemma?  I went on a date recently with a beautiful girl who had the breath of an open grave.  Now, I can tolerate breath that's slightly off.  A little gal must have had an onion.  But this is the type of breath that made you go,  She's smuggling diapers under her gums.  It was putrid and awful. 
[00:58:30]  It reminded me of the liquid that collects at the bottom of a garbage bag.  Yeah.  I can't believe I slept with her twice.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee.  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh, God dang it.  Yeah.  Oh.  We'll be in the knee show. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, God.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  We like to call it the O.N.A. virus. 
[00:59:30]  We like to call it spreading the virus across America.  I'm a musical.  We love being on XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  What's up, Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly in studio for Jim Norton.  Yes, for Jim Norton.  Same body shape, just different face.  So, I saw your knee is not quite as good as it was last time you were. 
[01:00:00]  I was actually a month into physical therapy, walking around, perfect, almost done.  Yeah.  Stage in Vegas at the Hard Rock Saturday night.  Took my brace off because it doesn't fit with designer jeans.  That's the faggot I am.  And then, is it, the brace obviously has to go on the outside of the jeans, right?  No, I can wear the brace on the inside, but I have to wear baggy, I have baggy jeans that  I can wear, but these jeans are sevens.  I don't know if you're familiar. 
[01:00:30]  These friggin' things are, like, tight.  But they make me, they make me look a little thinner.  Hold on, man.  Oh, no, come on.  Yeah, seven jeans are all the rage, dude, but mostly for girls.  No, no, no, no, no.  Guys are buying the sevens, too?  Well, guys, I actually went in to Macy's.  Like, dude, these jeans are ridiculous, they're, like, $200 a pair, girls are, like, doing  whatever they can just to get a pair, they'll blow you on the street just to get enough  money so they can get their seven jeans.  Yeah, that's actually true.  It's the thing to have if you're a chick.  I didn't know there was a guy thing going on with the seven jeans. 
[01:01:00]  I went to Macy's with Norton and my girl, you know, when Norton gets on these kicks  where it's like, I need jeans, I need jeans.  And Norton, for some reason, can't go shopping for anything alone.  No, he can't.  He needs people with him to advise him.  I know, but the funny thing is, is that you'll help Norton out, you'll teach him, like, dude,  these are what you get, this is why, and blah, blah, blah.  And then two weeks later, he'll actually teach it back to you.  Like, dude, what you want to do is go, you want to get these.  And I'll be like, yeah, really, Jim?  Why is that?  Who told you that?  I don't know, but, you know, I dig you, friggin' ape. 
[01:01:30]  You know what?  Jim does that a lot.  He does.  You bring up a good point.  He is really.  You tell that to me, too.  I'm like, you don't know anything about rollerblading.  What do you, I told you that.  Well, you're going to do it, you've got to get the rollerblades with the five wheels  instead of the six.  When is he going to tell me that gravity is caused by mass and not spinning a planet?  Oh, he will.  He will.  That whole discussion, that nightmare that we had to live through.  Jesus, I was, I was, oh, whatever.  Go ahead, Bob.  The seven jeans.  The seven gay jeans that you're wearing. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, they're so gay.  So, you said they make your butt smaller or something?  No, nothing could do that.  Or makes it thinner?  They make, because you wear baggy jeans, you're like a, you know, I'm a little chunky guy,  but these jeans kind of fit, but they stretch.  Yeah.  They're like Chuck Norris jeans, you know what I mean?  Where you can, remember those jeans?  You can throw a high kick.  Right.  Still tight, but you can throw that high kick.  Sure.  But, so I put them on, and I was, I wrapped my knee in an ace bandage, because I was walking  great, and then I'm on stage, I'm doing my thing, everything, and this, and this is, 
[01:02:30]  this, this gig is fucking hell.  I mean, you're really going to punch him over the face the whole time you're up there.  Hard Rock Vegas?  Dude, it's 1,500 people, but half of the people, all the people up front and back are all,  they have a stripper table from Experiment Rhino.  These are all famous people.  Bon Jovi was there.  You know what I mean?  It's all these people that, you know, they're looking at me like, who the fuck is this guy?  VH1?  Okay, nice talking to you.  And, uh, I had, I literally had two seconds left.  I mean, probably around five words to say in the bit. 
[01:03:00]  And I came, I did this thing, and, uh, I came back all my weight on this leg, and it  just went snap backwards.  And I hit...  Backwards?  Dude, I hit the ground like a fucking, just a fat sack of potatoes.  Oh, dear Lord.  And I'm on the ground just finishing the bit.  Oh, dear Lord.  Suck.  Should have been quick on that one.  Sound like that at all?  It didn't sound like that.  Thank God I'm a fucking one.  Sack of potatoes.  What a way to end your set, though. 
[01:03:30]  Jesus.  Thank God I'm like, I'm not like a joke writer.  I'm a physical comic, because people didn't know.  If I was just standing there the whole time, and then all of a sudden, the last bit, I'm  just on the ground, just, ah, they got him a loud jackass anyways, because they had no  fucking clue.  I'm just on the ground, ah, ah.  Oh, did you finish the joke?  I finished the joke.  I just go, I go, thank you, good night.  And then everybody comes out.  All the, they have midgets, you know, strippers, you know, a seven foot gay Russian sword swallower. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  They all come out, and they're grabbing me, trying to pull me back, and I'm like, my  leg, dude, my leg, my leg.  And I'm just like, fighting, I'm fighting midgets, and Russian sword gay swallowers.  Did you ask the midget if you could hold his little, disgusting midget hand?  Hold my hand.  Five cocktail franks, and a bun.  Dude, did you ever get surgery on this knee?  I'm, this is the, I was going, a month of physical therapy, I'm fine, fucking Saturday 
[01:04:30]  afternoon, this Thursday, going to the doctor, set the appointment, because I had to get my  knee better, to set the appointment.  Now it's all fucked.  Now it's fucked again.  I'm on, I'm on Vicodin, the way home, I'm just staring at the dude's TV next to me the  whole time, he's creeped out.  I'm just, I love the Vicodin, I love it, I sometimes wish for pain, so I could take  it, because I know if I start taking it without any pain, there's where the problem starts.  That is every guy, every guy that's ever had to go to rehab for Vicodin, it always starts 
[01:05:00]  with an actual reason to take it, actual pain, then the pain goes away, and you have some left.  That's how it works.  And then if you start taking it, when you don't have any pain, just because it's there,  you will then have to get more, because it will be gone, and there starts the big problem.  You still have some of that Vicodin from your, uh...  I have Vicodin.  Your dentist visit.  It's right there at home.  I still have the Vicodin, and I have the wonderful memory of what it was like to take. 
[01:05:30]  It's hilarious, because when I got my eyes done, I did the laser eye surgery, they give  you some, uh, some Valium, you know?  Valium, yeah.  And you only need, like, two or three tops to get through the procedure.  It's really not that big of a deal.  But they give you, like, 20.  They give you 20, so then I was just like you.  I'm like, wow, this Valium is pretty damn cool.  But you don't want to just take it, so you kind of, hey, you know, I don't think I'm going  to get a good night's sleep tonight.  I probably should take a Valium.  Probably take one. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  Just to sleep.  Right.  Now I have a reason.  Right.  Now I have a reason.  I stubbed my toe.  Yeah.  Ow.  But it's so funny, because you have this little, little bottle of goodness, just in the medicine  candle.  A little bottle of happy.  It's legal.  You didn't have to meet some dude in an alley.  You know, it was given to you.  You have to suck a cock.  Right.  And then you take it for the reason you initially had it, and then you just kind of have, have it there,  just waiting for some dumb excuse why you feel good about yourself, that you're going 
[01:06:30]  to be taking the Valium, even though you really officially don't need it.  Yep.  And it was definitely a sad day when I took my last one.  Oh.  Because you were taking it when you didn't need it.  Of course.  See?  But it was over, I probably had, I can't remember anymore, maybe a dozen left, maybe.  And it took me probably a little over a year to, you know, get through it.  A year.  A year, wow.  Wow.  You know, because it was like, I need a good night's sleep, but Anthony and I had this thing  to do, whatever, the next day.  I can't be tired.  So, you know, you make these dumb little excuses.  Yeah.  And then you're doing the same thing with your Vicodin. 
[01:07:00]  It just sits there.  It's a bottle of goodness, a bottle of happiness.  A bottle of goodness.  And it's just sitting there with the big pills in it, the big Vicodin pills, and I can't bring  myself to take it for recreational purposes.  I love drinking, you know.  I love doing a drink in and catching a buzz.  I do not like hangovers.  They're terrible.  And to be able to get fucked up, as fucked up as you would have to be drinking to get  that like that, that you can with the drugs, you would be so hungover the next day, you 
[01:07:30]  would not be functioning.  You could not function.  You start, but what happens is you take one.  I took five.  But then I needed 750.  But then one of your listeners, I was like, you know, he was like, dude, take one 750 and  then take a half of a 750 and grind it up and put it under your tongue.  Come on.  So I swear to God.  So I'm in so much pain yesterday flying home.  I didn't want to deal with it.  And it's on JetBlue.  It's not like I'm going to be in first class. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Like, you know, Jimmy Norton Entel.  But I took one.  I crumbled it up and put it under my tongue.  Why did you do that?  Did it do anything for you?  The listeners told me to do something and I did something.  Stupid listeners.  It actually, dude, let me tell you something.  It goes right to your blood.  Dude, two seconds.  And I was just, I'm just staring at the lady behind the counter like, wow, what a pretty blue.  JetBlue is such a good name, man. 
[01:08:30]  Look at the logo behind her and you're just staring at the color.  And on JetBlue, they have these paintings.  They hired somebody to make paintings, these really nice paintings with an airplane and  like a little JetBlue thing in it.  Yeah.  So you're walking down the thing and it was almost like I was tripping.  It was like a little kid throwing a hat up in the air in a park with an airplane in  the background.  And you're really getting into it.  I'm just like, wow, man, this is great art.  Great art, airport art.  That's fantastic.  You know, I would expect to have to be in a Holiday Inn to see Art of the Caliber, but 
[01:09:00]  to see it here at the airport.  That's funny, man.  Just talking about a little drugs.  Bill Burr.  A little Vicodin.  Bill Burr is like that.  Entered the discussion here today.  I was taking some for a dental problem I had and I took them, but I didn't take them  all.  The dentist always gives you a little more than you really need.  And they sit there at home just talking to you.  The bottle.  But I don't want to be the guy that just starts taking it for no reason.  You need a reason. 
[01:09:30]  If you start taking it for no reason, you're going to run out and need more for no reason.  You know?  I'm looking for anything.  Like, I wake up and go, I got the sniffles or something.  Is Vicodin good for a cold?  I think you're supposed to take, like, that numb up my nose.  That eucalyptus stuff.  What are you supposed to take?  You go to AOL.  You go to AOL and look up Vicodin and what it's good for.  It's not good for a cold.  Damn it!  All right?  I have to clip my nails and I'm very sensitive.  It says it's good.  Anything?  It says it's good when you get poison ivy. 
[01:10:00]  Really?  I got into a fight with my girlfriend, that bitch.  I'm emotionally hurt today.  I'm hurt.  My self-esteem is hurt.  He hurt me very much with his words.  Weah!  So, you can't be the guy that just starts popping them for pleasure because they're in your house, you know?  Is he still talking about his knee?  Of course.  Of course.  That's becoming like a career move for him.  I know.  I'm actually going to have to bust.  I was at a funny bone and I tweaked it.  I think I got my ankle, too.  I'm going to have to have something for my career. 
[01:10:30]  I hung up on him last night.  He was telling me.  Oh, my God.  But I was on Vicodin.  I was trying to tell him.  See?  Yet another torgasm story.  I can't take it.  Every time I call.  Dude, then the bus pulled up in Harrisburg, Virginia, dude.  And you wouldn't believe the wacky stuff that happened out there.  Dude, there was a mascot and they totally set it up like punk, dude.  Click.  You know you told that story for another fucking 20 minutes before you even realized it.  But Billy sucked you in.  He sucked me in because he asked me a question. 
[01:11:00]  So, I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I start answering it.  And then all of a sudden, I take it upon myself to just keep talking about other things that I can think he's interested.  Like, I think my...  I really forget that I don't have normal friends.  Right.  Because a normal friend would actually just sit there and do...  Like, his girlfriend would be there and just, like, take the phone away from his ears and just, you know...  He's still yapping.  Yeah.  But all my friends would go click and I'm still yapping.  So, anyways, dude.  I swear to God, I actually wanted to type the rest of the story out and email it to you. 
[01:11:30]  I'm sitting there.  Dude, he's told me so many of those fucking stories.  I feel like I was on the tour.  And then day three...  Yeah, it was a big break for Bob Kelly.  It was a big break.  No pun intended.  Billy actually does the best Bob Kelly.  He used to go...  Yeah.  What was it?  Bob Kelly in a cave?  What are you setting me up to bomb for?  Dude.  This is inside jokes.  Why don't you imitate me imitating you?  Dude.  Dude. 
[01:12:00]  See that?  See how awful I would have said it?  Much better coming out of Bob.  It's better when Jim's on because he kind of works with you.  Billy just smashes you right in the face.  Jim, I hung up on you last night in the middle of those awful stories, and I begin my day  hearing more tourgasm stories.  I'm sick of them.  The DVD's coming out.  Give us something to watch.  Television show, Billy.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I got to tell you something, though, Bill.  Yeah.  Because of his, you know, the breaking of the knee, we have Bob Kelly remixes out the ass. 
[01:12:30]  I heard the Immigrant song, man.  It was hilarious.  People love making these.  Oh, you heard that one?  I got that on my iPod.  I think accidentally.  Wait, Bob, you haven't heard any of these, right?  I've heard a couple of them.  I've heard the Zeppelin one was funny.  Yeah, that's a good one.  The Goodfellas one was funny.  You know what?  I was surprised.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand, man.  Nobody did Pope of Greenwich Village.  Like a dueling.  Oh, that would be good.  My thumb.  My thumb, Charlie.  Charlie.  I broke my knee.  No, my thumb.  They took my thumb, Charlie. 
[01:13:00]  I broke my knee.  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand.  I just like how he says, I broke my knee, man, in the exact same way like 18 times in  a row to the point.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  And right when you're like, is this on a loop?  He goes, I broke my knee, dude.  Did he hear the song?  He switched it up.  He switched it up a little bit.  That's one of my favorite songs.  Did he hear the song?  Man, I broke my knee, dude, song.  People just take your pain and your tragedy and turn it into songs. 
[01:13:30]  Dude, I've got to admit, like when I heard that play start on the audio, I was like, fuck.  Yeah, you sit there going, here it comes.  Yeah, funniest home videos.  You're holding you nuts.  Yeah, there's the father standing in front of his son with the pitch in the baseball.  On the background.  And the people are like discussing the play.  Like, dude, you should have broke right.  They're just screaming.  Right, right.  Fuck!  And they're arguing.  He was down, man.  He was down.  And they have no idea that you're fucked up yet.  I'm just off in the distance going, ah! 
[01:14:00]  I knew they were discussing the play.  But that's why I started screaming because nobody came over to me and I was so nervous  that nobody would take me serious.  So in my brain, I just kept going, I broke my knee, dude.  What about the one asshole?  God, that's the famous guy.  That's the famous sound.  I just can't just feel it.  Like, oh my God, we have him in studio.  He really felt like he was just like abandoned on the horizon.  He sounded so far away.  It's like a pterodactyl coming in.  Well, here's the Bob Kelly Immigrant Song remix because Bob hasn't heard this yet. 
[01:14:30]  I like this one.  We want to play some of the better remixes for you because you haven't heard any of these yet.  I don't know if this one is.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck!  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I broke it, dude.  I felt a crack.  Fuck.  I broke my leg.  I broke it. 
[01:15:00]  Hold my hand, man.  I've got to squeeze something.  Hold my hand, man.  That hold my hand, man, is one of the greatest lines.  You could have said that like the manliest man could say that, and it would sound faggy.  The way you said it is even worse.  Hold my hand, man.  As soon as I said it, I knew.  That's why I went, I need something to squeeze.  But that was even gayer, if you think about it. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Hold my hand, man.  It's getting dark.  There's midgets crying all over.  I don't know what to do.  There's midgets everywhere.  What's going on?  It's getting dark, man.  There's a light, and there's midgets crying.  We'll do it for Johnny, man.  Do it for Johnny.  You're one of those guys on the battlefield that would just be just like the movies.  Ah!  Ah!  Hold it up.  Suck it up, man.  Stay with us.  Stay with us.  Ah!  The blood and guts all over him. 
[01:16:00]  That's what he needed.  He needed that Barnes guy.  Yeah.  Right in his face.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  You see this piece of shit?  I got a bad feeling about this one, man.  Come on.  Ah!  What do you say, Bob?  All right.  Here's a taste of the song that we were discussing.  Down.  Way down.  They still have no idea what's going on. 
[01:16:30]  Talking about the play.  Yeah, just talking about the play.  Sounds like a murder has taken place.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  All right.  I broke my knee, man.  Ah!  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ah!  Ah!  Fuck!  I broke my knee, man! I broke my knee, man! I broke my knee, man! I broke my knee, dude! 
[01:17:00]  Hold my hand, do I get hurt?  Ah!  I'm gonna squeeze something.  Ah!  On the side.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I broke my knee, man!  It bent back!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Aw!  I broke my knee, man!  Oh shit!  Oh my God, it bent back!  I broke my fucking knee, dude! 
[01:17:30]  I heard it wait, dude!  Ah, fuck!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man, I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, dude!  Most people use Tylenol. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, Tylenol.  But not for a blown-out knee.  When T.O. ripped his ACL.  Advil.  My favorite thing.  Anybody talk about Dane's complete lack of concern?  The way he came up?  There was no concern in his voice.  Dude, yeah.  The ambulance is coming in a couple seconds.  In his head, he's like, this is great footage. 
[01:18:30]  Yep.  Exactly.  You know, the camera lady actually apologized to me later.  There's a girl.  For taping it?  Well, she couldn't.  They wouldn't let her shut the camera off.  Of course not.  She was like, you know.  Those are the moments you hope for.  I came out of the hospital, the emergency room.  She's right there with the camera.  Yeah.  She's like, sorry.  And I'm just like all messed up on Vicodin.  My knee's all wrapped up.  I'm in a wheelchair.  They videotaped.  Oh, the sound guy smashed my leg, too.  I'm just lying there.  I'm on the bus.  And the guy, he's saying goodnight to everybody. 
[01:19:00]  And he walks over to say goodnight to Dane.  And he just whacks my leg and just pushes it all the way to the left.  And I just another just...  Dude, they needed another take of it.  Come on, Bob.  Do another take.  We want to get...  The audio wasn't quite right.  We want to get your point of view.  Just punch him in the kneecap.  Here's another remix that you haven't heard yet there, Bob.  Oh, motherfucker. 
[01:19:30]  You mother.  You bent backwards.  Fuck.  Dude, hundreds of these came in, Bob.  Hundreds.  I love this sheep one.  We played about 20 on the show, but at least 100 came in.  I like it when he starts whispering.  Huh?  I like it when he starts whispering towards the end, like some mob movie.  Yeah.  It's so fucking much, dude.  Dude, I broke my knee.  Dude, it's busted.  I can't believe it. 
[01:20:00]  It's busted.  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  It went backwards.  Dude, it went sideways and backwards.  I can't believe it went backwards.  Dude, I'll take that Advil.  I was just walking on it.  Who's that random Arab who's just trying to, like, relate?  No, that's the Dominican that did it.  Oh.  You know what sucks, too, is he never owned responsibility.  No.  No, you're kidding.  But it wasn't me, man.  I played football, you know?  You're playing the game.  It's kind of hard to fess up if you're just playing football.  Really?  When you come up and, you know, it's touch football and you wrap your legs around me and punch me in the face? 
[01:20:30]  It's one of those risks to take.  And then all your friggin' 6'4 Dominican body comes down on my knee?  Really?  There really was no reason for any of you to be playing football.  Exactly.  Well, I quit.  I didn't want to play.  I was done.  I realized that.  They made you play.  No, we didn't.  They had activities for him during the day.  Stupid activities.  Activity.  Today, we're having a picnic.  Stupid.  And you will try to eat the jelly sandwiches as fast as you can.  I'm choking, dude.  I'm choking.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:21:00]  Fucking pathetic.  Tonight, we're going bowling.  Yeah, activity.  I owe it for Charlie Murphy.  But I'm going to tell you something.  During the day, the day was mine.  He didn't tell me, okay, we're going to bring you down to the hood.  Right.  Get stabbed.  Ah!  Ah!  We're going to race scooters today.  Jesus.  Bill, we're going to fuck some white women today.  And then we're going to eat chicken.  We're bowling tonight.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  My thumb!  Ah!  Pin backwards when I threw the ball, dude!  I broke my thumb, dude! 
[01:21:30]  I broke...  You see the seven-ton slip?  Ah!  No!  Don't keep bowling my thumb!  Bill, give me a pin to squeeze, dude.  I just need a squeeze of pins.  Activities!  Activities!  That's great!  Get all on the bus.  Get your permission slips signed.  Wait a minute.  It was like meatballs.  Yeah!  Like camp.  They had us horseback riding one day.  That was fantastic.  That was one of our activities.  Did they really?  Dude, every...  This is what happened.  They didn't tell us this.  And Gary Gellman...  This is why Gary...  He almost walked off the...  He snapped like the second day in. 
[01:22:00]  And I've never seen somebody...  I thought he was going to stab somebody.  He's on like...  I don't know what the fuck he's taking.  Dude, I'm stabbed!  He was going,  What the fuck?  I did this for a year on that stupid show!  I didn't want to fucking do this again!  I'm going to freaking go out...  Go horseback riding!  Why?  And I'm just staring at him like...  Oh my...  Last comic standing fucking killed this kid.  And he's just snapping.  Yeah, he lived in a house with ten other comics.  Oh my God.  And he got horseback riding though. 
[01:22:30]  You guys went horseback riding?  Dude, horse...  And Gary almost...  And Gary almost got killed.  They put him on a Clydesdale.  This old Cly...  It was the only horse big enough for him  because he's 6'4".  This horse was just like 8 feet tall.  It looked like from Lord of the Rings.  It's just hairy feet.  And Gary was so nervous.  You know, and the horse could sense that.  So we're on the horses.  All of a sudden, you're supposed to go,  Whoa!  You know, and pull back and...  Whoa!  All of a sudden, you hear... 
[01:23:00]  You're supposed to go, Whoa!  And pull back real hard.  All of a sudden, you hear,  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  And Gary just flies...  He just flies by going, Whoa!  And then all of a sudden, at the end,  You hear, Please, Whoa!  Please, Whoa!  Please, Whoa!  And this thing was in full gallop.  And it's like huge.  With him on it, it just looked disturbing.  It just flies by.  And then when one horse goes,  The rest of them think of they're going home.  So everybody's horse just started flying.  So we're all just flying down this dirt road. 
[01:23:30]  Matt Frost, he's one of the tour managers.  He's big, too.  He starts bouncing off.  He's like hanging off sideways.  So he falls off the horse.  Gary's almost crying.  The lady, she was like a 4'2 lesbian cowboy dyke.  It looked like, you know, like out of a Westin.  Just kicks the back of a horse and just, Wow!  Flies out, grabs the reins of Gary's horse.  Grabs Matt's horse on her horse.  It was crazy.  I used to do that.  I would have hung up on him. 
[01:24:00]  You don't think a lot of listeners just...  There's just too many people in the story, Bob.  You don't think a lot of listeners just...  All right, go ahead, Billy.  You just keep talking.  It's like an epic.  It's like Ben-Hur.  It was a production of Ben-Hur.  And you Brenner comes out of nowhere.  Six guns.  You've got to admit, you ended your story with,  It was crazy.  That is the line.  And it bombs.  It's bombing.  I did bomb.  The tour was in April. 
[01:24:30]  It's June.  It's over.  Coming around again, man.  I really have a problem with telling one story  and going into another.  I really do.  I think I have a tourgasm disease.  I really do have a problem.  What was the story?  What was that originally talked about?  You want to see this horseback riding on the DVD?  Yeah.  You know what?  The dumb Puerto Rican, the Dominican guy.  Yeah.  He was filming it, and he didn't get anything.  You know, because of your knee break,  this DVD's going to sell like crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, everyone's going to want to see that.  Hey, we're going to play another remix for you here.  One of the better ones that came in,  the Henry Hill, Bob Kelly remix. 
[01:25:00]  I like this one.  This might have been the best one that came in.  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He almost sounds like Bob.  He out of the car.  What do you want, fucko?  You want something, huh?  I broke my knee, man. 
[01:25:30]  Fuck.  I swear to my fucking mother,  if you touch her again, you're dead.  Oh, my hand, man.  I'm going to squeeze something.  Ah, fuck.  Wow.  How good is that?  That's got to be the best one.  You know what?  That's got to be the best one.  No, it's weird.  I had no idea.  That was by Harry T.  And Harry T. is now one of our interns.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  He's one of the new guys today? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Maybe he ought to get a little recognition.  That was a great one.  I like at the end, I go,  I hold my hand and he hit me again.  Bring him in.  Look at him.  We gave him little name tags.  Did you pat this guy down before you hired him?  Taliban.  That's what we said.  Everybody says that to him.  I have some shape now.  Harry Taliban.  It was a temporary thing, but now it's got to go.  Guys, we have a whole crew of new interns wandering around.  Yeah, the beard thing really makes you look a little terroristic. 
[01:26:30]  It's not the look I was going for.  I came in with three other people surrounding him just making sure nothing's going to happen.  I can tell you were probably going for a Stallone Cobra look,  and you've got more of a Mohammed Atta.  A Nighthawk.  Was that Nighthawks?  Nighthawks.  Yeah, that was a Nighthawks.  Nighthawks.  Stallone Nighthawks.  With Billy Dee.  With Billy Dee.  Very good.  Wow, yeah.  That was the one.  But it comes off a little bit, you know, jihad.  It's going to go then.  You should check his computer.  He has a flight simulator on his computer.  Yeah, practicing.  All kinds of schematics of the subway. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Harry T.  Well, that was a very good job.  The Goodfellas remix.  You sent another one in too, Harry?  I sent the Immigrant Song one.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Two gold ones.  Well, well, look who we have on board.  Welcome to the program there, Harry.  Brand new to the show.  I want Harry getting my coffee for now on.  So you've been listening to the show for a while?  Yeah, a long time ago.  A long time.  And you figured you would apply for an internship?  Yeah.  And I used to, back at NEW, I used to work for the night show. 
[01:27:30]  Ron and Fez.  Nice.  Oh, okay.  So you have a little experience.  I started the week you guys left.  Left, yeah.  So we didn't know you then.  Unfortunately, no.  See, it was a lot of fun when we were there.  Foosball tables, booze, broads.  It was a ghost town.  Yeah, after we got the boot, they kind of cracked down on everybody over there and took  all the games out and all the pinball machines and video games and beer coolers.  There was a closet where all your stuff was.  Like, all the fun stuff, they moved into your old office and padlocked it. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, padlocked it.  Yeah, and we ruined it for everybody over there.  Before we got fired, it was a daily party over there.  It was a fraud house.  With girls coming in.  We had a bartender.  Shot girl.  That was coming to mix drinks.  Shot girls.  There were foosball tables, video games, pinball machines.  And, you know, in between all this, we'd put on some kind of radio show.  Drug dealer.  Yeah, drug dealer, whatever you need.  Whatever you need.  And then after we got the boot, Ron and Fez were still there.  And they're very cool guys. 
[01:28:30]  They did a great show.  Still do.  And they were into having fun, too.  At night, you know, the beers would still be flowing.  There'd be things going on.  They cracked down on everyone so bad that all fun had to be put in the closet and locked  away.  Whatever happened to the enema's kiddie pool?  Oh, that I didn't, unfortunately, get to see.  What was that?  Oh, God.  They had a guy come in.  Paulo.  Paulo.  Paulo.  They loaded him up with an enema so he could barely hold anything.  Nothing.  Just as much as the guy could, you know, take. 
[01:29:00]  And we all went around in circles telling jokes to see whose joke would get him to explode  out of his ass into the kiddie pool.  Into the kiddie pool he was standing in.  That's a great make me laugh.  It really was.  I think Opie won by getting the...  He beat Brian Regan.  Yeah, Brian Regan was there.  Beat him, but it was such a...  It wasn't even a thought-up line or anything.  It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.  He got a dominatrix to start crying because he said she looked like Joey Ramone.  Then he threw poker chips in her face. 
[01:29:30]  There's nothing worse than seeing a dominatrix cry.  It's like, what are you crying?  No!  Just slap her in the face.  Yeah, smack her.  You're supposed to do this, bitch.  All right, Harry.  Welcome aboard there.  And thanks for the great remix there.  Good job.  Very good.  I think he's a standout amongst the two guys, the two other guys today.  I don't even want to know the other guys' names.  Three other guys today?  What are three other...  There's a total of how many new interns here today?  Four?  Is that why they have the name tag?  There's intern one, intern two, intern three, and Harry T. 
[01:30:00]  And Harry T.  Harry Taliban.  See how this works?  Harry the Taliban.  We know.  We know Harry's name.  That's how you should get him in here when you want coffee.  I like Paul!  He really does look like one of the pilots.  I'm trying to play some of the other remixes for you there, Bob, because you haven't heard  these.  Actually, a lot of people did it to music as well.  Nobody got Deliverance?  Yeah, I was going to play that one, actually. 
[01:30:30]  Someone did.  We'll play that one for you.  Someone did.  See how original I am?  But first...  Yeah.  Yeah, it worked.  20 people not even in show business came up with that, you hack.  Listen to this one.  Ah!  Ah!  Fuck!  I slapped my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  Please, please, please hold my hand.  Hold my hand, man.  You want some more?  I've got to finish something.  Hold my hand, yeah, yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Hold my hand, yeah, yeah.  Hold my hand, and I'll see you home.  I broke my knee, dude. 
[01:31:30]  Hold my hand, man.  I love that.  Hold my hand, man.  I wonder if, when this does come on on TV, if there's going to be a bunch of midgets just  crying watching this.  Yeah.  That's the reverse.  All right, we do have a...  You tend to get a little emotional over midgets.  We do have a Deliverance one.  I'm so distracted watching Jessica Simpson with his new music video, Dukes of Hazzard.  Dukes of Hazzard.  She's all dressed up in this little, of course, Daisy Dukes. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, she's doing a remake of These Boots Are Made For Walking?  Is that what that is?  Willie Nelson.  With Willie Nelson, huh?  Look at this video.  Yeah, she's so young, she didn't know who did the original.  I swear to God.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it young, or is she fucking just a dumb broad?  Well, she is stupid.  She is really stupid.  And it's not even an act.  But she, they got her, she just, shh.  I was just going to say that.  It's not even an act.  Because I was going to be like, she has a music career, a movie career, and her own TV show. 
[01:32:30]  What a dope.  Yeah.  I see you occasionally get distracted.  Your earphone cuts out?  Yes.  Yeah, it happens when they talk from the studio to Hawk over there.  One of our earphones go out.  Isn't that a great little side effect to somebody talking to someone else on the show?  And you got to just put it out of your mind?  Get done and work on that.  It's so goddamn distracting.  I take it you have to deal with this every day.  On a daily basis.  And I don't, I try not to miss a beat.  It's like, oh, there, there, half your ear's gone.  Imagine that during just conversation, you're talking during the day, and out of nowhere, 
[01:33:00]  somebody just shoves an earplug in one ear for about five seconds and then pulls it out.  And you're supposed to not even acknowledge it or say a word about it.  Yeah, yeah, how was work today?  Oh, it's pretty good, but oh, Jesus Christ, pull the earplug out.  It's so distracting, but we're not supposed to acknowledge it.  Yeah, not at all.  All right, here's another Bob Kelly remix for Bobby in studio today.  I'm so angry today.  I know.  This river don't go there, Antri.  You done taken the wrong turn.  Now let's you just drop them pants. 
[01:33:30]  Drop?  Just take them right off.  Ah, what the fuck?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Come on, squeal, squeal.  Eeeeee!  Ah.  Eeeeee!  Ah.  Eeeeee!  Ah.  Eeeeee!  Ah, what the fuck?  Bob, I want to thank you, by the way.  You made our job so easy. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  We just sat back for like a week straight just listening to these things instead of doing a show.  That was disturbing, that one.  I just remember, I just remember hearing the, uh, you, you talking to Dane, you guys were  so nice to me when I called in when I was all on Vicodin.  Yeah.  Man, take care, Bob, blah, blah, blah.  And yet, as soon as you got me off the phone, you were like, dude, Dane, you got to get that  audio.  Yeah.  We need it.  Listen, Dane, get that fucking audio.  We would have, we would have paid big bucks for that.  We got it for free, but we would have wrote some serious checks.  Dane was like, don't worry, I'll get it. 
[01:34:30]  It was like a, it was like a CIA drop to the KGB.  Yeah, I'll get it.  The same tone he had when he asked you if you were okay.  Don't worry.  The ambulance is coming.  Keep rolling.  Keep rolling.  What other ones do you want to play for him?  I don't want to play all of them, obviously.  No, some of them are just really bad.  Bob Kelly, Sergeant Hartman was, a million of these came in.  Yeah.  I think I, I got an example of one.  Yeah, I think we got an example of the better one.  What have we got here, fucking comedian?  Jim!  Whatever you do, don't fall down. 
[01:35:00]  That would break my fucking heart.  Down, you're way down.  Get your ass up.  What's your excuse?  I snapped my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I'm asking the fucking questions here, private.  Do you understand?  I broke my knee, man.  Well, thank you very much.  Can I be in charge for a while?  Do you feel dizzy?  Do you feel safe?  Jesus Christ, I think you've got a heart off. 
[01:35:30]  Can we get him some water?  Pull my hand, man.  Do you want some water?  I've got to squeeze something.  What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  You're going to be right.  I broke my leg.  You have to un-fuck yourself, or I will unscrew your head and chip down your neck.  You've got to give it up to him for being able to listen to this, because I know Joe Theismann  has never been able to watch that tape.  I couldn't watch it. 
[01:36:00]  I can't watch that.  They wanted me to watch it.  Really?  They actually took it, yeah, like four days after it happened, they brought me and everybody  else in a room, because the executive, the producer dude wanted to get reaction starts.  Oh, that would be good.  So all of a sudden, they'll tape you watching it.  Yeah, they wanted that whole shit.  So I walked in the room, and I'm sitting there, and they start playing the video before with,  you know, the play, and people are making the play.  And I'm watching it.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Why?  Can't watch it.  I go, dude, this is stupid.  I go, you're making me, so you can get me what?  Cringing? 
[01:36:30]  I just walked out.  Yeah, this is one of your activities for the day.  The ladies' activity.  That's hilarious.  The guy actually asked me after that.  Comedy and activities.  What?  You still want to be on the boat?  Right.  He asked me if I wanted to go white water rafting.  Oh, really?  After I hurt my knee.  He goes, it's up to you.  Yeah, that's a safe sport.  Yeah, that's good.  Are you going to strap me down to the front like the broad on the boat?  Like a hood ornament?  Someone would drown.  Comedians and, like, comedy tour and activities, it's not, you don't do it. 
[01:37:00]  It's just the word.  You go, you sleep late, you wake up, you do your gig, you go back to bed.  The reason why they had us do stuff is because they knew they were videotaping it.  So they knew if...  Something was going to happen.  Well, no, they knew that if they just let us do what we were going to do, we were going  to sleep all day.  Right.  And play Xbox.  Play Xbox.  Yeah.  Eat, go back to sleep, do the show, and then watch TV and play Xbox.  It would have just been, I mean, just an Xbox ad. 
[01:37:30]  So activities opens up the opportunity for people to get injured and fuck themselves  up.  Somebody...  You're comics.  Dane cracked a couple ribs.  Jay Davis got hurt.  I got hurt.  Everybody...  Matt Frost rolled an ATV on his leg.  I thought he was going to get killed, dude.  He came, like, a split second from that thing rolling over his head.  It's insane.  Yeah, it was stupid.  I almost got killed out.  It was crazy.  I played paintball after this.  And I'm such an asshole.  You know when somebody goes...  I know I have my leg brace on. 
[01:38:00]  The guy goes...  He goes, one, two, three, go.  But instinctually, when somebody says go, you just run.  And I have a leg brace.  I ran and just slipped.  And I just got nailed by five dudes with paintballs.  I'm like, what am I, an asshole?  Stupid activities.  Yeah, it doesn't have to be that hard, Bob.  You can just do your show.  Don't tell me, kid.  I'm fine with sleeping and playing Xbox.  Playing paintball.  And they say we got a rappel down the side of this cliff.  And, dude, I told them my helmet didn't fit, dude.  We had a rappel. 
[01:38:30]  What are you kidding?  They took us rock climbing.  I cracked my skull, dude.  I cracked my skull, dude.  They took us rock climbing.  You went rock climbing?  They took us indoor rock climbing.  And I'm the only fatso that couldn't make it to the top.  This little kid made it up.  I tried three times and my hand was just shaking.  Oh, no.  You were the shaky hand guy?  Dude, who's stupid?  Trying to reach.  I can't reach, dude.  We had to make pottery.  We had to make a bowl.  Make pottery. 
[01:39:00]  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  We didn't have to do that.  I was going to say.  You know something?  It didn't surprise me, though.  Dude, my bowl is broken, dude.  It's all damn damn.  My bowl is broken.  I broke my teacup.  We went canoeing.  Did you guys have a big day where you played another tour in events?  Like a three-legged race?  What do you mean?  A potato sack race?  The Torgasm Olympics?  The Torgasm Olympics?  You meet up with the Kings of Comedy tour bus or something?  And we fought them?  Night fight?  Yeah, the I'm Rich Bitch tour. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  The Star Trek one, is that worth a replay, you think?  Eh?  Eh.  Not really?  Eh.  And the We Were Soldiers, the one that came in today?  Yes or no?  That was close to being good.  It was almost good?  Almost good.  Not quite.  No?  All right.  Some people.  Oh, we're crushing dreams.  They're sitting there listening going, oh, they're talking about mine.  They're going to play it.  They're going, eh, that piece of shit.  Nah, throw it away.  All right.  That's it.  Gone.  They still brought it up on the air.  They talked about it.  That's good enough.  They talked about it. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Oh, it's okay.  The next level is they'll actually maybe play it.  Yeah, play shit on it.  Write another one.  You put together another one, I'm sure they'll play it.  I'm sure Bobby will get hurt again during his activities.  I knew when this happened, I was going to go.  Oh, that's great.  Nice, hot slamming.  All right.  Well, that's it for the Bob Kelly remixes then.  Yeah.  They're still coming in, though, believe it or not.  How many are these?  How many are these?  Like a month ago, I think.  Over 100.  I got at least 35 in front of us. 
[01:40:30]  Only 10, like, that are even kind of good.  Yeah.  So, good job to everyone that sent one in.  Wow.  Has anybody yelled that shit out at you yet?  No.  Well, not that.  Yeah.  I get that.  I get hold my hand and not you.  Yeah, not you is a big one.  It's so funny, though.  It's like, you know, not you.  Seinfeld.  No, they go like this.  They go, we love you.  We love you, Bob.  And I'm like, thanks, man.  They just go, not you.  But nobody else knows what the hell they're talking about.  It's usually like, you know, a couple OA fans. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  And then it's everybody else in the crowd.  So, they're just looking at me like, what does that mean?  Yeah.  And I'm like, dude, nobody fucking, nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about.  Not you.  Just a disgusted Seinfeld.  Oh, it still hurts my feelings.  The worst is on AOL, the AIM.  Because they go, dude, you're really great.  And I type back, thanks, dude.  And then, not you.  And they just sign off.  They don't even give you a chance to say, fuck you or anything.  But then they sign back on, and they're like, dude, I'm sorry.  I just had to do it. 
[01:41:30]  It's like, fuck you.  Pests.  What is that, Alanis Morissette?  Oh, my God.  What's she doing?  It's good.  She got, like, white.  I don't know what that is.  It's kind of like an expert.  Cruella DeVille.  Yeah, she's got Cruella DeVille stripes on her hair.  Coming up.  Okay, we're going to take a break.  We got Bill Byrne's studio.  Are you promoting anything, Bill?  I got nothing.  You got nothing.  I got nothing.  Dude, that's the best shit.  Norton turned me on to that.  Favorite, favorite.  It's a cool version.  Did you turn Norton on to that?  On the plane, you don't need a parachute.  You can just use this.  I saw the commercial, right. 
[01:42:00]  But hit it when you're close to the ground so you don't crash.  Yeah, that's what happens.  Did you turn Norton on to that?  Probably, and he'll probably tell me about it next week.  Dude, you got to get this.  Because of him, I got that.  What is it called?  It's like a locker room in here now.  Right Guard Sport.  Yeah.  But it has this lever on the side of the can.  It has a lock feature because it's so strong.  Yeah, it's great.  It has a lock feature because you could do some damage.  Actually, it's like mace.  You could just spray it in people's face.  Wait, let's get a match and see what kind of damage that...  No.  I'm kidding. 
[01:42:30]  There's nothing worse.  Look at that Opie face.  Look at him.  He's butt...  Look at that little evil face.  I could take you to a few websites so you can watch what happens when people do that.  Look at Ben comes running in panicking.  He's some asshole in the woods.  Why don't we just have a little experiment?  Look at that.  That's the face right there.  What's wrong?  That's the face.  Yeah.  That's the same face you had when you were teasing Bernie Getz.  Right.  Oh, I forgot that Bill was here for that famous day.  Yeah.  Let's break Bernie's CD.  We talk about that day all the time, man.  I got someone to just pick it on somebody. 
[01:43:00]  I really forgot who it was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was yelling, I'll stand up for your rights, Bernie.  Bernie.  You don't have to take for that.  I forgot because I thought I saw my death.  I'm sorry, Bill.  Shoot him, Bernie.  My mind went blank.  You were dying laughing like it was a little brother.  Inside, though.  Trying to get his ball back.  Dude, inside, I was freaked.  Have you seen the video, the security camera footage of that yet?  Uh-uh.  It's really creepy looking.  It's really creepy.  Black and white from a corner.  Yeah, it's always creepy. 
[01:43:30]  It could be anything on a security camera.  He's eating his yogurt.  He's just like, oh, man, that's ominous looking.  I bet something bad's going to happen.  Like, it'd be the most boring nothing.  The guy behind the deli counter where no robbery ever happens, but you watch going,  yeah, I bet some guy's going to come in with a gun and shoot this guy.  I don't think he's making a sandwich.  We've talked about this a lot, but what really scared me, what was happening in the studio,  I was laughing my ass off.  It was funny, and I knew what was Bernie really going to do to any of us, right?  But then when he, no, in studio.  He shot four people. 
[01:44:00]  He shot another guy who was just laying there dying.  That's the point I'm going to make, because obviously he had nothing on him.  It's when he darted out of the studio and ran for a bag that he brought with him.  I'm like, that's when I was praying Master Poe wasn't, you know, praying that Master Poe  was on his game that day.  That he checked him for weapons, because I'm like, oh, my God.  Dude, you don't think a guy that shot four people in a subway would just bust a CD case  and stick the shard in your throat, like, in a second?  He doesn't need a gun. 
[01:44:30]  I wasn't worried about that.  That guy's a madman.  When he ran out of the studio, that's when I panicked, like, oh, God.  Did Master Poe do a job today?  I was watching like it was a show.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm going to his bag, and I was like, wow.  Is he coming back in here?  Is he packing up the lead?  I was that white guy in all those awful Def Jam bits.  If he was in the back, motherfucker, he would have ran out the room.  White people just sit around and go, gee, let's he go in his bag.  I was doing exactly that.  Well, I wonder what he's doing in my white man voice.  And why did he run? 
[01:45:00]  Black people be run out the joint.  We ever find out why he ran into his bag?  Because when black people run, we run the fuck out that motherfucker.  Why in the horror movie, the white family always stay in the house?  Black people say, get out the house.  We be run out the house and shit.  Look behind you, bitch.  Behind you, motherfucker.  He's right behind you.  Here's the footage from the security cam.  Look.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  Doesn't it look evil?  I know this is radio, but here's me getting ready to smash his CD.  He has no idea.  He's just sitting there all happy.  It's all jumpy.  Yeah, that's the time lapse looking.  There's me smashing his CD.  Jesus.  And I roll.  Laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  I'm laughing.  Bernie's saying, you motherfucker.  He gets up.  Here he comes.  Now, Eric.  Oh, he's actually throwing Eric.  Oh, you did do that.  I threw Eric in the way.  Like throwing Eric in between him and Bernie.  And look, now I have my hand holding Eric's back, pushing him into Bernie.  Your hand went up, which would have actually had a bullet hole in it. 
[01:46:00]  He grabbed the microphone to make sure this got on the air, though.  Defensive wounds.  Oh, because that's when he jumped up.  Look, now he's like pointing at me from above the screens.  Give me my motherfucking CD.  And then he just resigns himself to the fact that he's not getting it back and says, fuck  you, I'm leaving.  And there's Master Poe coming in studio.  Oh, and Anthony was going, it's getting hot in here.  That's the code word to get Master Poe in here, to kick a little ass.  All right.  And there's Bernie.  We calmed him down a little, but then he just goes, fuck you and leaves. 
[01:46:30]  This is a cool day.  You guys have given us two of the greatest moments on the XM show.  The whole Bob Kelly breaking his knee.  And, of course, Bill was here for the Bernie Gets segment.  And we've tried to get in touch with Bernie again.  And a couple of months ago, I guess, he was saying, yeah, he'll do the show.  But now he says, no, he's not doing it.  Ben?  No.  I keep a correspondence with him, don't you?  He won't even do a phone or anything.  Won't do anything with our show anymore.  He's worried about us and his mayoral campaign.  Yeah, because that's what he's got to worry about.  So this is the thing. 
[01:47:00]  If he suddenly agrees to do the show, don't bring him in because that means he's plotting.  He's plotting.  He's plotting.  He's bringing something like a gun.  But getting back to my question, what was he going for in that bag?  No one ever found out.  You think he maybe had a weapon?  A moment of clarity?  He had a flashback.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Like, he usually has a weapon, but, you know, obviously he couldn't bring a weapon to a radio station.  And ran to that bag and went, ugh, darn it.  Don't have it.  Don't have it with me.  I'll bring it next time.  Oh, it was unreal.  He undid, like, eight years of therapy for that guy. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because then the next time I was here, they made something.  And the porn star cried.  I was, like, literally at home going, dude, I don't know about this guy.  Did you say they?  No, I always go in.  Wait a minute.  Did you say they?  Yes.  No, it's Opie.  Yeah, I know.  It's not.  No, it wasn't.  It was Anthony.  It was Anthony.  I was bad cop that day.  See, when I watched that, when I watched you throw the poker chips.  That's when I went, who are the people I'm friends with?  No, dude.  Honestly, the poker chip incident was probably the hardest I've ever laughed in my life. 
[01:48:00]  Jim Norton will say the same thing.  And Anthony.  We all were laughing so hard, none of us could talk.  None of us could talk for, I don't want to exaggerate, about a minute.  It was really, yeah.  We all were laughing in the background.  This girl came in to bring us presents.  She was from Pennsylvania or something.  Oh, my God.  Maine, Maine.  She traveled all this distance to bring us the lesbian couch.  And she brought us other trinkets.  They were little gifts that she apparently picked up because she had some kind of a, like, 
[01:48:30]  flea market booth or something.  A yard sale.  Probably made them.  And, yeah, they were like these little things that you would find at a garage sale.  So she brought me.  You had buttons and shit.  She had her, and each thing, I think, was supposed to, you know, mean something to us.  Mean something because I was talking about poker, so she brought these poker chips.  But they were, like, they were the worst poker chips and a little holder that you.  They're the poker chips you got when you were.  Oh, we have them, don't we, somewhere?  They're the poker chips you got when you were, like, 12.  It was like you saw your dad playing poker, like, in the 60s with the relatives with him.  They had them on a mod set. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Just in the background.  It was awful.  Look at this.  The one's the odd couple of years.  It was like a Lucy's hat box that she brings back from the department store.  Those are the famous poker chips.  We can get a lot of money for those.  Even how old it is.  There's got to be 500 here, and it's solid oak.  Yeah, it's oak.  And this was on some racist coffee table in, like, the 40s.  Yeah, the 40s with an Aunt Jemima statue next to it.  And so Anthony got that.  It's got an animal's head up on the wall.  Yeah.  A big moose head up on the wall. 
[01:49:30]  And she gave those to me.  All right, go ahead.  What did she give me?  Some kind of pottery thing?  Because I smashed it right away.  It was a salsa bowl.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which held chips and salsa.  What does that have to do with Opie?  It was crap.  It was all just crap.  It was a big bowl.  It was something because...  And then a smaller bowl in the middle that was attached to the big bowl where you put  the salsa, the salsa, whatever.  It was because we had talked about Opie and his lack of entertaining at his apartment.  His bare apartment?  His bare apartment where he has guests over to watch football games.  There's nothing about places for him to sit.  He really does have an Asian director's apartment helping.  He came in to help. 
[01:50:00]  He really came in to help.  I have nothing in here except for television and chair.  So she was getting a little upset at the fact that we were goofing on the quality of  her gifts to us that she brought from Maine.  And at one point, Opie just grabs the poker chips and heaves them at her.  And you hear just poker chips flying and lumber, which is just a big piece of wood, hits the  console and knocks into her and hits the floor.  Oh, you threw the whole thing? 
[01:50:30]  The whole thing.  Her reaction...  Devastated.  It was...  She ran out of the studio crying.  She tried to hold it together for a second.  Yeah, she tried.  Like, take the joke, like...  And then it just...  Her emotional defense broke down.  We had to get her on the phone.  I know.  I always leave.  I can't believe I was a part of this.  He's disgusted.  Like, we did that St. Patrick's Day and everyone was going up telling those...  Oh, the bad racist jokes?  I was just like...  Literally, again, just going home.  Don't you go home and go like, I shouldn't be around those people. 
[01:51:00]  I like the two of them.  They seem like nice guys, but it really does.  Three quarters of the way into my stay, that's what happens.  I'm thinking, okay, this is going to be a good show.  You know something?  They're going to start doing the weather in a couple of minutes.  78 degrees out, and then all of a sudden they have some...  Some black chicken in a boot.  All hell breaks loose.  Yeah, someone ends up crying.  Well, Anthony, today in the news...  I feel the same way, though.  I go home sometimes going, what is my job?  What is my job to make girls cry? 
[01:51:30]  Wait, yeah, wait, getting back...  It was just mean.  You were mean.  Hold on.  I was being mean.  He made the porn star cry.  I don't even remember what that was about.  Because any time you brought up if she had been drinking, it was a major issue with her.  Oh, her.  Okay.  And he being an intelligent guy sees that.  Right.  And immediately just keeps going for every time he brought it up.  Yeah.  It was two.  And one kept consoling.  You kept psychologically playing the one.  Well, let me tell you how I rationalize it so I can sleep at night.  She started it.  Gorgeous, by the way. 
[01:52:00]  She was beautiful.  She came in.  She was obviously drunk.  She made a 10.  I feel like she was a 3.  Really?  Yeah.  She was ridiculous.  You made her cry?  She was so ridiculous hot.  And she's in with some other, you know, slob.  Mary Carey.  Mary Carey.  Who was coming back to the program.  Totally was selling her out.  She's the one I didn't like.  Yeah, yeah.  She was selling her buddy out, too.  She was.  This chick.  Look how hot this girl is.  Yeah.  And this picture with her.  That isn't a good picture.  That's not even a good picture.  No, why?  It's not a good picture.  Let me explain that.  She's holding up a wow sticker, you know, for RateMyWow.com, another website. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  She's crying.  She's already crying.  And we're still trying to get her to look hot for this picture.  And Mary was saying, smile, just smile.  And she went from crying to that smile, back to crying again after the flash.  Psychotic.  And that was really kooky.  What was her name?  That big panhandle whore.  Her name's Tony Roberts.  She's from, like, Oklahoma, Texas.  Right.  Is that the panhandle?  But that was Anthony that made her cry.  No, she was.  So she was obviously intoxicated.  And I brought it up.  I went, what about the drunk one?  Because I don't know their names. 
[01:53:00]  So it was, you know, the slut and the drunk one.  And she looked at me.  She looked at me all pissed off.  And I was like, well, you've obviously been drinking.  And I thought, like a stripper, like any other stripper or porn stars, you'd be going, yeah, we were out all night.  Fucking A, woo, you know.  But no, she gets all upset, like, you know, she's not drunk.  So I had to keep reminding her that she was indeed drunk.  Now, you see, Anthony, you started this saying that you were going to justify how you can sleep at night. 
[01:53:30]  That's how I justify it.  All you're doing is telling us what happened.  See?  How do you justify it?  That's how I actually feel the rest of the audience.  That and two Vicodin.  Yeah, exactly.  I justify it.  No, I justify it by she wasn't really being honest with herself.  And I was just, you know, filling her in on what happened.  And she's a whore.  See what happens.  And she's a whore.  She's so hot, and I'll never have sex with her, and she must pay for that.  See what happens.  See, there you go.  What happens, though, is when you're in this studio, this all seems to make sense. 
[01:54:00]  It really does.  Right.  You're like, you're trying to entertain.  You don't give a fuck about people's feelings and stuff.  And you're just trying to do good radio.  It's when you hit the street right after the show.  Somebody holds the door for you.  Hey.  Yeah, and you realize, wait, you're actually, yeah, the sun hits you.  There's normal people walking down the sidewalk.  A bird lands on your shoulder.  They would never, yeah.  That would never, that would never listen to this program.  And that's when you start feeling, oh, I got to go home and take a shower, man.  You can almost relate to those serial killers that carry on a normal life in a regular daytime job. 
[01:54:30]  Because, you know, when they're sitting at their desk, they're probably thinking, oh, she was really screaming when I was sawing her head off.  I'm glad I got that.  I kind of feel bad about that now.  But they go back at night, pick up another whore, and gut her.  That's right.  Yeah, I need to do something nice.  Anybody want something from the canteen truck?  Coffee or something?  You want a sandwich?  It's on me.  It's on me.  I should have cleaned their fingernails better.  I don't think they were clean enough. 
[01:55:00]  You got to do something to make up for it.  Oh, God.  You're right, though.  It's just a really bad job we have.  But at least you're not bringing girls in here and just, you know, oh, let's see those tits.  And just looking at their tits and having, oh, those are nice tits.  What do you think?  You guys are making these whores cry.  We do try to be blatantly honest with the girls.  Yeah, you really are.  At this point, we have a stripper band on this program.  Why?  Yeah, we were nice to the last batch that came in.  Yeah, we were sick of it that day.  Remember, you were like, they have nothing interesting to say.  But then we did another couple of girls that came in a couple of weeks ago and just killed. 
[01:55:30]  Wait, you're here.  Yeah.  That's why I said they're great.  They were awful.  All right, why don't we take a break and we'll regroup here.  Right, EO.  We'll do the, yeah, we got a little prank call thing we're going to play as we step aside.  But we have Bill Burr in studio and Bob Kelly.  It's a funny thing.  They did a prank on Torgasm.  They, no, I'm joking.  Oh, my God.  I really am just a fucking wordy asshole.  It was crazy.  We were racing another bus and my arm got stuck out the window.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah, dude.  Dude, my arm, dude. 
[01:56:00]  Dude, I broke my arm, dude.  When we get back, Anthony, a little tease.  Sexiest state in America.  A bit we were doing when we first got here.  Kind of died.  Yeah, it did.  We got some highlights from some of the contestants.  Trying to bring it back.  I think we might try to bring it back for a little while.  But first, let's listen to this and we'll continue.  Hello?  Hello, is Tim there?  Who?  Tim.  I'm not open yet, my friend.  Twelve o'clock, we open.  Oh, Christ. 
[01:56:30]  Hello?  Hello.  Is Al there?  Al, uh, Al Winger?  No.  Koholik.  Al who?  Koholik.  Afterholik.  Afterholik.  Afterholik.  There are nobody by that name.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  This is a two bar?  Yeah.  Yeah, I wonder if you could help me. 
[01:57:00]  I'm looking for Phil Myers.  M-I-Z-A.  Myers?  Phil Myers.  Myers, yeah.  Phil Myers!  Phil Myers!  Phil Myers!  There's nobody by that name.  There's nobody by that name.  He's not there?  No.  Okay, thank you.  Hello?  Hello?  Uh, is this a two bar in Jersey City?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd like to know if you could tell me if there's an Al Kill You there?  Who?  Al Kill You. 
[01:57:30]  Al Kill You?  Yeah.  Kill You.  Right.  What's his name?  Al Kill You.  Oh, okay.  K-I-L-L-E-U.  Al Kill You.  Al Kill You.  Al Kill You.  No, nobody by that name.  Oh, uh, listen, you know, I'm from Clifton.  I'm not from Jersey City.  I'm supposed to meet a few guys there, you know.  Uh, could you call, uh, how about Stanley Payne? 
[01:58:00]  Is Stanley Payne there, you know?  Stanley Schreiber?  Stanley who?  Stanley Payne.  Hello?  Stanley Payne.  What are you trying to kid me now?  No.  What's about you?  You want to hear you kid me around, eh?  What?  Listen to you, you fucking bum.  You want to keep me, you motherfucker?  I'll come down and kick your fucking mouth up.  Listen, why don't you go out and fuck your mother? 
[01:58:30]  I'll fuck your mother, you stupid son of a bitch.  Why don't you come down here and have a little Nazi and come down and tell me that?  I'll come down and run.  Press your face.  I'll break your fucking middle.  I'll give you a hundred dollars to buy it.  A hundred dollars?  You don't even get no hundred dollars.  Well, listen, you fucking motherfucker up.  Come over here.  I'll be here when I'm digital.  I'm over here.  I'll try a mile.  I age what I'm doing to you.  Yeah.  I cut your fucking balls out.  That's it.  You motherfucker, you're a brat.  You scumbag.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O and A virus. 
[01:59:00]  Wow.  You rule, Bernie.  Bernie.  No.  No.  This one, right?  Yeah.  This is, um...  Oh.  What are you?  You motherfucker.  Tony.  Tony.  Tony.  Oh, he's coming over here.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie, sit down.  Sit down.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  He's really mad.  He's mad.  You pissed off Bernie.  All right.  Get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here. 
[01:59:30]  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right.  Sit down.  Hey, that's for your rights, Bernie.  Sit down, Bernie.  Sit down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Oh, it's okay.  It's okay.  Oh, it's okay.  Oh, it's okay.  Oh, it's okay.  All right.  Have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, you got to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, folks.  Oh, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  All he did was take the CD out, I think.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Get your CD out.  I won't be here again.  Bernie.  Oh, Bernie.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie's leaving.  Oh, man.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit. 
[02:00:30]  Wow.  That was legendary.  That was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  He was out of his mind.  You know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man.  And when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman  and go, not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport.  Oh, yeah.  Just like, ah, just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart and a toaster and a little smoke billed up and he couldn't handle 
[02:01:00]  it.  Right.  Imagine that.  You didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just...  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You bastard.  Have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Josie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Miraculously. 
[02:01:30]  Miraculously.  All right.  Miraculously, he emerged from the vehicle unharmed.  What are we talking about?  I thought I had to run out and start eating this egg sandwich.  Those video shows and videos of just horrible things.  Car crashes.  Plane crashes. 
[02:02:00]  National Geographic.  Yeah.  Unbelievable disasters.  And no one ever dies.  You know what the worst show is for those clip shows?  Is Max X, Maximum Exposure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because the guy that they have narrating it makes everything sound fun.  And here the police officer gets two bullets in the head.  Wow.  That's got to suck.  And we got it on video.  Yeah, we got it on tape on Max X.  And he says, and thanks to the video cam and the cop car.  Here it is.  I bet this cleared his mind.  Yeah.  Like really bad Arnold Schwarzenegger lines. 
[02:02:30]  This woman working the deli counter is having a bad day.  A guy comes in with a machete, and there goes her head.  You're going to have a hard time counting the register now.  Like he's making jokes in your house, like, oh my God, the guy's dead.  This girl will never walk home alone again after getting raped by five Puerto Ricans.  And we got it here on Max X.  On Max X.  Those spics brought a camera.  Isn't that horrible?  And we got the video of them stealing that from a white guy. 
[02:03:00]  It's the worst show because the guy sounds much too happy and enthusiastic about some of these clips.  It amounts to Faces of Death without the somber music and monologue from the guy.  Faces of Death used to be horrible.  It was like, and then the train hit the woman as she was crossing.  Da-na, da-na.  You know the music and everything?  The guy's voice was so creepy.  Yeah, fast forward now.  Uh-oh.  Look out.  Here comes the 5.15. 
[02:03:30]  He's all happy about it.  He's like, wow.  Yeah, that train caught her.  Yeah.  What?  Hey.  The last time she'll check her email before work.  Last train to Deadsville.  Hey, look out.  Choo-choo.  Yeah, much too happy.  That's why we have one.  They pitched it.  They're like, it's too dark.  Can you inject a little energy?  Yeah, can you happy it up a little bit?  Can you make that death happy?  They just kept the same copy and just had them say it happy. 
[02:04:00]  Threw in a couple of awful jokes.  Limbs were falling from the sky when the planes collided.  Here's a leg in the backyard.  No thanks.  I'll have a wing.  Plane crash.  What are you fucking...  You're insane.  This is what happens when you hang out with a local Arubans.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, is she dead or not?  Who knows now?  One guy confesses.  Then they're denying the confession.  She's obviously dead.  Dude, I'm telling you, we talked about this last time. 
[02:04:30]  I was with my girl in Aruba, and there's, you know, Aruba, 2% crime rate, safest island.  That's what they say.  Yeah, but that 2% is some brutal crime.  Oh, yeah.  That's the difference.  Then I go, it doesn't matter.  They throw down.  They don't.  They have nothing.  And they see us in a luxury hotel.  They're going to wait on us hand and foot, and they live in a hut in the desert.  A what?  With a tin roof.  A hut.  A hut.  That's a Jewish hut.  Is there a desert in Aruba?  If I was a rich man.  La, la, la, la, la, la. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  It's a desert.  There's a desert in Aruba?  We flew over on a helicopter, and we're flying, and my girlfriend's like, is that where  the natives live?  It's part of the tour guide.  They don't have spears, you ass.  Yeah, today we're going to be snorkeling.  Let's just call them.  With sharks.  Just call them.  Just call them inwards.  Watch out for the machete.  He bit my fucking leg, dude.  He bit my fucking leg, dude.  Dad.  Give me an octopus.  I need something to squeeze.  I go in the cage. 
[02:05:30]  The cage goes in the water.  Shark in the water.  I'm sharking.  Ah!  Dude.  They're well in a duty.  A Spanish lady.  You need a bigger boat.  You need a bigger boat.  You need a bigger boat.  Ah.  Ah.  Why don't you try shoveling this shit out?  So Aruba, the Huts, the natives.  The people that rent the jet skis and the pack.  Right.  Those friggin' psycho terrorists, and they're just staring your girlfriend down.  Oh, yeah.  And they're raping her in front of you.  Just non-verbal.  You know, they're just staring at her. 
[02:06:00]  You're signing the thing, trying to get the money off.  Jet skis.  Jet skis.  Yeah, you can get one for free.  You show me your tip.  What'd you say?  Nothing.  I said you get one for free.  We work for tips.  Oh, they're the worst.  Dominican Republic, same way.  Resorts are gorgeous.  The rest of the country, unbelievable.  I wouldn't go to Dominican Republic for a vacation.  They literally, they get you on the bus, and they drive like 90 miles an hour trying  to blow by the poverty.  It's like the gauntlet.  It's like chickens.  It's like chickens and shit running across the street.  That is bad when you have to leave the compound. 
[02:06:30]  People with like polio, and then they just get you fucking right into this beautiful  resort.  Oh, like early 1900 diseases.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's like a plague.  They're throwing dead babies at the bus.  Dude, you nailed it.  You nailed it, because when I was just in the Bahamas, you fly in, and then the ride from  the airport to the really nice resort I went to, Atlantis, is just a horror ride.  And you finally get into the compound, and you're like, well, you see it on the horizon,  and you're like, oh, there it is.  Oh, God.  I hope you make it.  You should get tipped off that you have to stay in a compound. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  I mean, even Jamaica, you can't leave the compound.  No.  Well, but we talked about this on the air, too.  Like, when I was in the Bahamas, you'd get these dumb, drunk girls, because they had their  coconut drinks, decide to take that walk down the beach.  Yeah.  And you don't even know the girls.  You're like, oh, for the love of God, will you turn around?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Now you're not on the hotel property anymore.  And you hear them like, let's go find some pot.  All giggly girls, and you're like, oh, my God.  The chick in Aruba went with three guys, got in the car, they went to some lighthouse. 
[02:07:30]  She's making out with one of the guys in the back seat.  If you're three guys, and one guy is now in the back seat making out with the chick, you  know the other two want their turn.  They're not there to just drive.  All you have to do is they're not there to drive and hang out.  All you've seen Saturday Night Fever.  Right.  All you have to do is you could be a good girl or you could be a cunt.  If you're a girl from America.  Double J.  Remember when Double J got her in the back?  You happy now?  Can you dig it?  I knew that she could.  I knew that she could.  No, come down from there.  You're going to hurt yourself.  You didn't call me, Tony. 
[02:08:00]  You didn't call me.  No, come down.  We'll talk about it.  I love that movie.  My hair.  Stupid shoes.  My hair.  I watched the hair.  I spent hours on my hair.  I was looking for you.  I was looking for you.  I was looking for you.  There it is.  You're a filthy whore.  Annette.  Cigarette.  And they just pound her in the back seat.  She decides like halfway through Double J.  She didn't want any anymore. 
[02:08:30]  Tony, we can make it.  We can make it, Tony.  Tony, I was thinking.  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  You like it?  Now I do it?  You cry?  Come on.  Stop crying.  Fucking Brooklyn.  Hey, Father, life.  Father, can I talk to you, Father?  Father, Father.  She loves to taste the communion way for his father.  I was thinking maybe, you know, you could get her, you know, an abortion.  The Pope could get her an abortion.  What a fucking waste of life that guy was.  With his big shoes, his platform shoes.  He wanted to be cool like the guys. 
[02:09:00]  Where were you?  Oh, I was looking for you guys.  Are you a good girl?  Are you a good girl?  It's about dancing down at the disco.  2001.  2001, the disco.  The disco.  Yeah, that was some love.  The last guy I was with sent me flowers.  Maybe he thought you was dead.  One of the most embarrassing moments ever in my life was going to see that movie in the 
[02:09:30]  movie theater.  First, just standing on the line because you stand on the line to go into the movie theater  and everyone from the high school I go to was driving by.  Disco sucks!  Disco sucks!  Yeah, so I'm standing on the line trying to hide.  They say my friends don't see me.  You go in and it was me, my mother, and my grandmother.  And I was sitting right between my mother and my grandmother watching Saturday Night Fever.  And here comes the, you know, the effing scene in the back of the car. 
[02:10:00]  And I was all hot and sweating.  And, you know, my hand on grandma's leg.  Yeah, you had your penis through the bottom of the popcorn.  Grandma's powder was caking on my middle finger.  Oh, it was so embarrassing.  Like they're cursing and, you know, I was all embarrassed to be there.  Why can't I have popcorn?  What's that in the box?  Where?  Hey, grandma, I cut the bottom out of the popcorn box.  What is that?  Do they give hot dogs with the popcorn now? 
[02:10:30]  This guy went to, just to move backwards a little bit, to a Dominican whorehouse.  Are you insane?  What's your name, bro?  Frank.  All right, what happened to you?  Well, we went, I went on a trip there.  And we were at this place.  And the waiter, you know, we were thinking, we'll go to a strip bar.  And the waiter's like, oh, I'll take you to a private club.  So he goes, we're all getting off in a little bit.  So we all pile into this van.  And they take us through like this, like you guys were saying. 
[02:11:00]  Third world country.  Yeah.  Why would you do this?  The windows were taped up.  You know what?  They have these drinks there.  You drink it.  After a while, you'll go anywhere and do anything.  So basically.  One jumps on your hood and rips off your windshield wiper.  It was crazy.  Like Lion Country Safari.  That chicken foot.  That chicken foot.  Yeah.  Voodoo.  They give you a chicken meat just to throw at them.  Holding up a tire with a pin, poking it.  You get a flat.  You're fucked.  That's a boo-boo joke, no? 
[02:11:30]  I had to figure it out.  Yeah, I know.  He's still telling me the story.  I know.  The guy's still trying to tell a story.  We're the worst listeners ever.  I'm getting raked with a bushel of bananas.  Is anybody listening?  The guy's still trying.  Dude, shut the fuck up.  No way to shut up and just enjoy.  And then we get back to you.  Yeah, we'll get back to you.  That's how the show works.  Relax.  He's wordy as I am.  Holy crap.  All right, now it's...  So anyways, torgasm.  You know, we're on this activity.  He ended his story with it's crazy.  All right, go ahead. 
[02:12:00]  Okay, so we go through this part.  It sounds like you guys were saying.  Chickens, the whole thing.  And it's very scary because we're coming from a very luxurious resort.  And you go through the gate out and you go into basically...  We're in the brochure.  And yeah, it's not in the brochure.  Beautiful sunsets.  And we have hammocks.  Speed it up.  You're worse than me.  You pull up to this private club and it's like an old house.  And you go through it and there's like a bartender and all these chicks.  And here, now you guys can believe me or not.  The chicks are all smoking hot. 
[02:12:30]  I swear to God.  Smoking hot like...  Were they good looking?  I mean, yes.  I swear to God.  Yes.  What are you, Saul Rosenberg?  Yes, they were.  Yes.  They offended me.  Listen, so...  They line them up for you, just like you think.  And you pick them.  And it's like 25...  Anyway.  Wow.  Click.  Wow, I know what I saw.  Click.  That's exactly what he does to you.  Oh, my God.  Click.  I'm going to hang up on myself. 
[02:13:00]  That was good.  I'm going to...  You got it right to the part that maybe would have been interesting.  Right.  And then hung up on him.  Smoking hot.  And then line them up.  Click.  Well, this guy went to a whorehouse in Mexico.  Let's see if this guy has better luck.  Michael, go ahead.  All right.  So, this is a thing.  I love the Takata tile they had on the floor.  Right.  And the Terracotta.  I just turned the radio down.  I wish I heard of...  Finish that guy.  So, anyway.  Oh, boy.  I came to a whorehouse down in Mexico. 
[02:13:30]  Christ.  Yeah?  I went to Brazil.  There you go.  There we go.  I went to Brazil.  They have these places.  You go in.  There's a ton of chicks.  You tap them on the shoulder.  You go upstairs and you can fuck them in the ass for 30 pesos or whatever the fuck that  shitty money is.  Cheap.  And then you go back downstairs.  What is that, American?  You have dark meat chicken.  There's no white meat.  It's just dark meat with grizzle for like a dollar.  It's actually good.  But where does the white meat go?  I don't know.  To us. 
[02:14:00]  To us.  Here, it's a chicken.  To us here in America.  We're not buying Brazilian chicken.  The local chicken, the white meat, has to stay in the area.  Well, it's just the white people.  It's not just the winged leg thing walking around.  I want to tell you.  The white meat goes to America.  The dark meat goes to our horse.  Our horse.  Our horse.  Our horse.  They export the good shit to us.  Who are you kidding?  I'm telling you, dude.  This is what happened.  And I was with my girl in Aruba.  She goes, this guy told me about this island.  They have a party.  And I'm like, you're Otty. 
[02:14:30]  Don't talk to these motherfuckers.  We're not going to a fucking party.  A party.  On a boat with a bunch.  Look it.  Put your arm next to that guy's arm.  Do you see the difference?  Dude.  There we go.  We're not going.  You're talking our language.  Ant and I experienced the booze cruise.  Yeah.  You told me about that.  We're like your chicks.  It doesn't matter to Ant and I anymore.  But our chicks are like drunk on like really dark, dark, sculptured bodies.  And me and Ant just looking all, you know, flabby and white and awful.  You get down there and you're the whitest guys ever. 
[02:15:00]  Your arms are tanned.  You get the farmer tanned.  Oh, completely.  And then there's the guys that work down there at Club Med.  One guy is like the trapeze teacher guy.  He's from France.  And he's like, yes, I do the trapeze.  It's wonderful.  Come up.  I will teach you.  He gets 17 abdomen muscles.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  He's doing like three triple flips.  And then you go up there to try to like do something.  And look cool in front of your chick.  You're hanging all bad.  And he goes, okay, now put one leg over.  And he's doing triple flips.  I'm hanging upside down with my shorts like up. 
[02:15:30]  And my sack is now hanging out of the side.  Every time he lands, he goes, voila.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He doesn't need, you know, take the safety net off for when I go.  I don't need the safety net.  He's literally showing you what he's great at.  Oh, yeah.  It's like you coming in.  Yeah.  Home for a radio show.  Yeah, go ahead.  Do it.  Here's the deal.  The average guy in America, you know, we get to go away maybe once a year.  These guys are down there working on their tans every day, working on their eight pack and sculpturing their bodies.  And you constantly.  You come down with your chick thinking you're pretty secure with your relationship.  And you're just showing up every corner you turn at these resorts. 
[02:16:00]  You go snorkeling.  And the guy that's doing it is like an ex-Navy SEAL.  He's got like the right equipment.  You're there with your face all twisted in the mess.  You've got the snorkeling.  Your lips are all big.  You're trying to walk with the flippers on.  You just look retarded.  And there's your chick looking at.  Yeah, exactly.  For some reason, he has to keep adjusting her scuba gear.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's what you need.  Let me help you with that.  Your tits flops out. 
[02:16:30]  Mauling your chick.  Yeah, she actually puts the scuba mouthpiece in her pussy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't know.  Well, we went to church.  This is how we do it.  This is, you put it in good luck.  In my country.  This is for good luck.  In Aruba, you put, kiss it with this thing.  And then you go in, no shock or bite you.  And somehow your girl doesn't realize that these guys are just all pussyhounds.  Why is he here?  That's why they're doing that.  Oh, they go, they're just being nice.  And the story I want to tell.  They never want to listen to the truth.  When we went to Club Med, I would stay up to 4, 4.30, 5 in the morning because I had 
[02:17:00]  to outlast my girl.  Because I was ready to go to bed at like 1.  You know, you're up real early when you're doing this stuff and you're doing all sorts  of activities and you're booze cruising.  You're like the leopard that fell asleep next to the carcass.  But I'm like.  You know, all of a sudden the hyena comes in and just drags it away while you're snoozing.  I was convinced if I fell asleep early and went to the room that forget it.  All the hell was going to break loose.  Once you go get the hair braided that's blowing somebody in the island.  Braids, pretty lady.  Braids, pretty lady. 
[02:17:30]  Do you like a necklace, a coconut, coconut?  But we did the booze cruise where the whole way out they're giving this mantra.  What happens at the booze cruise stays at the booze cruise.  And you're just watching girls getting dry humped and making out with the locals.  What's the worst feeling?  With the locals.  The actual visual that you get when you picture it like your girl with a tri-colored, uncircumcised  cock in her hand.  Tri-colored.  Just like a four shades of dark cock. 
[02:18:00]  And just going, what?  I thought we were having fun.  Her naïve.  And her just not even realized.  Her naïve.  We just went down for some fun.  They're not even naïve.  They want to do it.  This is local.  And they're giving them permission.  They just say what goes on.  You're supposed to put the whipped cream on the cock and this is how you drink it.  It's one of their activities.  Yeah.  What am I going to do?  Go against the culture?  You lick the whipped cream off the cock.  Yeah.  Then you drink the sangria.  Yeah.  You spin around three times.  And you get fucked in the air.  And then it comes on your neck and you rub that in. 
[02:18:30]  And that's good luck for the rest of the year.  You want to not have good luck?  I did it.  I did it for us.  I did it for we're married and now our children are blessed.  You have good luck.  I took a native load on my chin.  That's good luck.  You see how it's a yellow consistency?  Oh, that would be perfect.  We need to renew it until I'm 29.  I've got to go back.  If my load comes out yellow, it's good luck.  If it comes out clear, you have to do it again.  It's just the worst. 
[02:19:00]  You drive up to the resort and all the guys are just lined up.  They're supposed to be the welcome committee.  Yeah.  You know, committee, and they're already giving mostly your girls drinks right away.  They're doing pussy triage is what they're doing.  They're looking around.  It's like MASH when the copters and the ambulance came in.  They're all excited.  Here comes the new pussy.  Let's check it out.  Move on to him.  He needs immediate attention.  This guy's injured.  It's the same thing.  Hot pussy, fat chick, let her go.  Yeah, that one has a boyfriend, but he hasn't done a freaking, you know, crunch in years.  They're just scoping it all out.  Two weeks, they're going to have. 
[02:19:30]  That's why I'm so glad I don't drink.  Yeah.  That's why I'm so glad I don't drink.  And I don't.  She wants to go clubbing.  We went to the Carlos Charlie's.  Oh, boy.  The place she wanted to go to.  Everyone goes there when they go to a Ruba.  I didn't.  You know why I didn't?  Because I'm not going to hang out with these fucking motherfuckers.  No.  At two o'clock in the morning.  And why?  I'll just go to Harlem.  You're out of your mind.  You said a brain crimp.  You know what I did?  I went and got dessert.  I got a deck of cards.  We went to a little cafe, and we played fucking gin. 
[02:20:00]  You're a madman.  You want me?  You're playing gin.  You're not fucking sucking uncircumcised cock in the bathroom by accident.  It's not happening.  Because it's built on trust, people.  Right.  You're going to be there with it, Buff.  I know, but God forbid, you know, what if I'm a freak?  You just don't even want to be in the atmosphere of looking at them gawking.  I got my camera stolen.  In a robot.  Don't tell me.  What?  Everything was missing except your camera and your toothbrush.  And you got home from your trip, right? 
[02:20:30]  You bought all new stuff.  Thank God you didn't have to buy a new toothbrush.  And then you got the film developed.  And when you got the film back, it was the robbers had taken some pictures of them with  your toothbrush up their ass.  No?  Anyone?  No.  Anyone?  You fell asleep.  You woke up.  You were in the bathtub of ice.  And a note that said, get to the hospital.  One of your kidneys is missing.  No?  No.  I didn't need a note to know that your kidney's missing.  I hate that one.  And if you're the robber.  Right.  Why don't you just rub your dick on it?  Why would you sodomize yourself? 
[02:21:00]  Stick it up your ass.  I don't know.  That's the way the story goes.  It's funny.  When you hear the guy that it actually happened to his cousin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's always...  On tourgasm, Dane actually, I won a trophy.  When we were racing.  There were trophies for your activities?  I won a trophy, and he stuck it in his asshole.  When I came on the bus, I grabbed it, and I was kissing it.  How big a trophy was it?  I was just kidding.  All right, listen.  Let's go to...  How big a trophy was it?  Let's go to this guy on Long Island.  Let's go to this guy.  Go ahead, guy.  Yeah.  One year, I was up in the Catskills. 
[02:21:30]  Even locally in America, I was up in the Catskills.  And one of the guys who works at the resort, he's showering in a semi-outside shower, and  he's all foamed and lathered up, and he goes to my girlfriend, would you like to help me  wash?  And my girlfriend, of course, like, disappeared into the shower.  Yeah, man.  That's what happens.  And I didn't see her for the rest of the week.  It was just like...  She went in, and you were still with her?  Yeah.  We were walking down the path, and he stuck his head, like, outside of the shower. 
[02:22:00]  I want to...  Did you grab her by the hair and choke her out?  What do you mean, you should have?  If you're still with her...  I would have grabbed her by the hair, choked her out, and then sucked that guy's cock.  Just to show her.  Just to teach her a lesson.  But I'm telling you, that's how easy it happens.  You think you're going to have a great relationship, and then take some dude laughing up at an outdoor  shower.  I'll tell you something.  When the girls get drunk, it's a whole other story, too. 
[02:22:30]  When girls get drunk, we were down at Mardi Gras.  And there was a whole, like, gang.  And that's what they were, a gang of these black guys that were just harassing white people  that were walking back and forth.  We were watching from the balcony.  The black guys?  Yeah.  There were a gang of them?  A gang, and they were harassing white people walking by.  They would leave the black people alone.  I've never heard of that, either.  But the white people would walk by, couples, they would start harassing them, actually smacking  the hats off of the white guys' heads.  So this one guy and his chick are walking, and we're just watching it happen, and there's  nothing you can do about it. 
[02:23:00]  You see him coming down the sidewalk, and you go, oh, these two are fucked.  Oh, they are screwed.  A loving couple at Mardi Gras.  You can't yell, because it's so loud, you can't get your point across to these people.  And we saw the chick is so drunk, so they smack the hat off the guy's head.  The guy turns around like, what the fuck are you doing?  Let's go of his chick.  His chick is so drunk, she staggers.  One of the guys grabs her by the waist, pulls her kind of against the wall, and starts making  out with her.  She puts her arms around the guy and starts kissing him, because she's so fucked up. 
[02:23:30]  She has no idea where she is, who she's with, what she's doing.  She's making out with the guy.  She's a whore?  Yeah.  If you turn around and saw your girl making out with...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What do you do?  You know what you do?  You grab her by the hair, and then you suck his cock off.  I could have you shot for this.  You suck that guy's cock off.  Why do you keep going back to sucking that guy's cock?  And then he's got to say, I'm kidding.  The one time we gave it, we gave it to you the first time.  Like, all right.  We all laughed uncomfortably, but you keep going back to that, man. 
[02:24:00]  I'm on Vicodin.  I'm just...  We all...  Something's happening.  We all search for a punchline.  Right.  You just got to throw something.  Ah, suck a cock.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Second time, now it's kind of a fetish.  Right.  It's kind of a fetish, Bob.  What are you going to do, Bill?  I have a fucking fetish.  All right.  Let's go to Glenn on Long Island.  Glenn.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  What's up?  I was vacationing in Newark.  I went to Jamaica, and I had a great friggin' time, man.  I'm trying to call back to the capsule.  Yeah.  I paid this guy 30 bucks to take me up and see the plantation where they grow the weed. 
[02:24:30]  It was great.  We had a bonfire up there.  It was snorting friggin' weed right off of the...  Right out of the fire.  Just throwing the...  Just throwing the buds on the...  That's what you want to do.  Go to a Jamaican pot plantation where you'd probably end up as fertilizer.  You're not supposed to leave the hotel in Jamaica.  You know what's funny is when you talk to those guys and you're on the resort, they seem like... 
[02:25:00]  They just seem funny.  Oh, look at his little accent.  Yeah.  And then the second you get off the resort and you're in the car...  It's threatening.  ...and you're surrounded by all of him, you're like, oh my God, I don't even know this guy.  It's threatening.  This guy could kill me.  When we were in Brazil, the hotel was surrounded by the favelas, those projects on the hill that 
[02:25:30]  you see on the TV.  And a lot of the people worked there.  And they're like, hey, it's all the nicest.  And you're like, that's the favela.  It's real dangerous.  Oh, no, it's okay.  This one's okay.  And then as soon as you see them down at the cafe and stuff at night or the disco, they  totally change.  You can see their eyes just kind of roll back.  Yeah, yeah.  Just like, hey, man, what's up?  And they're just looking at you like, this guy has...  Look, motherfucker, I don't have to get your towel anymore.  I'm not waiting on you now, yeah.  I'm off work. 
[02:26:00]  Bill, he had the best comment, though, driving really fast from the airport as fast as you  can to get to the resort.  So true.  It's like guerrilla warfare going on.  Hey, we were supposed to play some clips from the sexiest state.  We should do that.  Because we're trying to get this bit going again.  How's this bit go, basically?  We get couples to call in and have sex on our show.  And have sex on the phone.  And if it sounds real and hot, you know, we don't like fakers, they will represent their 
[02:26:30]  state.  And if they're good enough, they will be proclaimed the sexiest state in America.  Yeah, for example, this is Allie from California.  She was trying out to become the...  Was she alone?  We don't really care about the guy's name.  Oh, okay.  It's a guy show, more or less.  Sorry, ladies.  It's Allie and some dude that was railing her.  Yeah, bitch.  Fuck it.  I thought they were done, no? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, fuck you.  Yeah, you like that?  Here you go.  You got me?  There you go. 
[02:27:30]  A little taste of Allie's performance.  It's not bad, right?  I'd like to knock her off and suck the guy's cock.  Right?  Right, Bob?  Come on, Bob.  Me and you.  Me and you.  Two men being...  Two guys.  Be a man. 
[02:28:00]  Be a man.  Suck that guy.  Yeah, if you do it with another guy, it's not gay.  Gay!  It's a project.  It's an experiment.  It's a torgasm project.  Flux capacitor.  We got another example.  Sexy estate.  This is Stephanie in PA, Pennsylvania.  I remember this one was really, really hot.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:28:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yes, Anthony, they can't hear us right now.  Yes.  Oh.  She's quivering.  You hear her voice?  Yeah.  She's quivering. 
[02:29:00]  They're getting close now.  Back to the action.  Yeah.  Oh, baby.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'll put it in her ass.  That's the problem.  And there you have it.  Stephanie from Pennsylvania.  That was very good.  Yeah.  Nothing.  I understand what it is on TV now. 
[02:29:30]  Thank you.  Wait.  What happened?  I guess they're showing, uh, yeah.  Yeah, it just said unpiloted plane over Nebraska, but it's the old Payne Stewart.  Oh, okay.  Flight, which is really creepy if you think about that.  It's the plane load of corpses flying in the air.  That is a creepy story still.  Frozen corpse flight.  What's the deal?  When it lost cabin pressure, did you die instantly?  Pass out.  You pass out.  You're slowly but surely.  It wasn't one of those catastrophic losses of pressure where, you know,  boom, and the pilot knows and put the oxygen on and land the plane. 
[02:30:00]  It was a slow leak.  So they slowly lost pressure and just kind of went to sleep.  And then the plane just continued flying by itself for a long time before it crashed.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So it was just up in the air with the dead people in it just flying.  It was an autopilot, right?  Pretty much.  Yeah, yeah.  And they just kept flying until it ran out of the road until it ran out of gas and crashed.  Yeah, it was supposed to make a left and go over to Dallas.  Make a left.  Yeah.  Yeah, it kept going straight.  Hang a left.  Make a left at Tallahassee. 
[02:30:30]  All right, back to Sexy Estate.  This one says Tom.  Ugh.  This guy called in with a check.  Didn't say the name.  Oh, all right.  Out of respect.  This is Tom's performance.  Hopefully we get to hear the check.  I like the last one.  Respect for the broad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got a fat stomach.  You ain't going to know a name.  You don't know a name?  Come on.  The fat stomach slapping against the ass.  She could be the one.  Are you a good girl or you a cunt?  All right, here we go.  Happy, now you're a cunt. 
[02:31:00]  Hold my hand.  Come on, dude.  One.  Just one.  One.  I don't like the fact that she's making the yummy noise like Young Frankenstein.  You went, grrr.  Come on.  Make her gag once.  Yeah.  Push that thing right in there.  He's got his hand on her mouth? 
[02:31:30]  Oh, man.  Must be.  More hot coffee on her chest.  Shut that cut.  Welcome to Aruba.  That was kind of boring, actually.  No, that was good. 
[02:32:00]  You know something, though?  You listen close.  It's not just her.  It was her sucking cock.  Yeah.  So, you know.  Oh, that's what it was.  That's not boring.  You listen.  You hear some, like,  Yeah, you want a little slop.  That's why she was doing that.  You want a little oatmeal action, though.  You want a little...  A little slop on the way out.  Smacking.  Spit on the top of it like a...  Smacking noises.  I hate that in the pornos, man.  You don't like when they...  I don't like that when they...  I love that. 
[02:32:30]  They spit on it.  A string of saliva.  Yeah.  She's, like, 12 feet away from the cock.  I love that.  Can't you just let the saliva fall out of your mouth or something?  Ah, you got to spit on it.  No, spitting is, like...  It's like a fight.  Like you're going into battle.  You're going to slap it with a little white glove.  I battled you to a duel.  What an evil look that just came on your face.  It's hilarious.  Two, I spit on your penis.  I spit on your cock.  It is no good American cock to circumcise. 
[02:33:00]  Two, that's the evil laugh.  Ah, you should have snuffle off against trunk like all French people.  I want lint on your cock.  All right, one more example of sexy estate.  This is Arielle from California.  Okay.  I'm ready.  Is this all the same woman?  Yeah.  Might as well be.  Who is this, Miss? 
[02:33:30]  I like the inhale.  Stick it in.  Where?  I like if she moans as she inhales, too.  Yeah, that's good.  Like a harmonica.  Yeah.  A harmonica.  A harmonica.  I like when they sound like a dog after they're hit by a car. 
[02:34:00]  They're definitely rocking back and forth.  Yeah.  This guy's a champ.  Maybe that's the guy.  Lucky girl.  Little Jimmy lines popping in.  There you go.  Arielle.  I had a chick leg.  I fucked a French broad.  Remember when we used to live together?  Oh, really?  I tried to block that out, yes. 
[02:34:30]  You guys are all roommates.  Yeah, we lived together for three years.  When you couldn't just click the stories off, huh?  Oh, Billy had a show.  It's funny because you both are sitting here.  It's almost like you don't even acknowledge each other on that level.  But you actually lived together?  Three years.  Three years.  He was an absolute pig.  He was an absolute fucking anal.  He was like a museum.  He doesn't know what anal retentive is.  I was going to say it.  It was like a museum.  Dude, he would clean out his fucking ears and leave the Q-tips with the earwax on the 
[02:35:00]  fucking sink.  No way.  And when I was like, dude, what the fuck?  All right, that's above and beyond.  Dude, fucking anal retentive.  What the fuck, dude?  When you clean your, Anthony, when you clean your ears and you get a nice, a yellow and  a little bit of brown.  Where it looks like peanut butter?  Yeah.  You want to throw it.  You want to show others.  You want to show them.  Look what I got.  I'm with you.  Look what I got.  I can't even look at it.  It has to be wrapped in a tissue and thrown into like a tampon. 
[02:35:30]  You got to save it.  You look at it.  Like, I got it.  That little itch, that thing in the back that you've been trying to get.  You got it.  No bodily fluids or pastes or whatever else comes out of a body should be left out anywhere.  Not even in the, like, garbage.  Don't forget, it was me and him lived together.  But then there was the Akin.  He was a South African.  Nigerian.  Nigerian roommate.  He was the guy who owned the apartment.  Oh, really?  So you had all the three.  Like, I slept on the couch when he was around.  It was a walk-through bedroom. 
[02:36:00]  I had it.  I booked a short-lived fucking show out in L.A.  So I was kind of bi-coastal.  So he came in.  And I think I was going to stay in that.  Whenever I came back to fucking town, it would be three of us living in this railroad apartment.  There was just like a strip, yeah.  Yeah, the Nigerian dude, he had the big bedroom.  And we had, like, half a bedroom.  Oh, he had a huge...  And any time you were fucking somebody, he would always end up come walking through.  I put the curtain up.  I wound up putting this curtain, and he'd still, there'd be, like, that little fucking hole. 
[02:36:30]  You'd hear his fucking...  His loud, you know, shoeless foot walking through this creaky apartment.  And then he'd stop, and you'd see him peeking through while you're with some chick.  And what are you going to...  I mean, it was just like Aruba.  All right.  Bob, I want...  What was his accent?  He was, like, English, African, so he really...  Dan, he made the dark chicken meat, too.  Remember that time he came back, he gave me, like, a fucking cow's face? 
[02:37:00]  He gave me this thing.  Cow's face.  I was smart.  I'm like, dude, no, I don't want to eat it.  Dude, I'll try it.  I get this thing.  I go, dude, this mushroom is unbelievable.  It had to be five feet by five feet, this mushroom.  And he goes, that's not mushroom.  It's snail.  It was a fucking...  A snail the size of your fist.  And I thought it was a mushroom, like a shiitake mushroom.  How do you eat something you don't even know what the fuck it is?  It gets worse.  He brought it from some cookout up in the Bronx.  I go, what kind of meat is this? 
[02:37:30]  And he brought it down.  He said cow.  I go, where'd you get the cow?  He goes, in the Bronx.  They bought a cow somewhere in the Bronx.  You ate this?  I didn't know.  I was trying to be cultured.  I didn't want to offend them.  I was not in the Bronx.  I am so gun-shy of food.  I have to know exactly what it is, where it came from.  I thought it was a mushroom.  A mushroom.  I didn't know it was a snail from Africa.  Think something, something else.  It was a giant muzuku tribe mushroom.  Yeah, but he didn't name like a...  It's not a rump roast. 
[02:38:00]  You know what I'm saying?  It's not a...  Yeah, yeah.  What is it?  Cow.  Cow.  What part?  They don't care what part it is.  It's like a forehead.  It's like anything.  A forehead.  It's like real thin.  I guess that's where they get the roast beef from.  The forehead.  One slice at a time.  Like, what meat would be...  That's great.  Come cow.  Because they don't care what part it is.  We're all picky over here in America.  I want the shank.  I need a filet mignon cut from...  Cow.  We don't care.  We never knew what he was talking about.  How many was he when he was in the hockey? 
[02:38:30]  He'd come in the Rangers.  He'd start laughing and we'd laugh.  He'd go...  I'm a robber.  And we'd like...  Dude, that's fucking hilarious.  And he walks up.  No clue.  No idea what he was saying.  All right, listen.  Let's take a break.  When we get back, we should do some news finally.  All right.  I want to happen since Friday.  I got to send one of the interns out.  One of the new interns.  You want to do that before break?  It's a mission.  All right, let's do that before break.  We got to talk about the Puerto Rican Day Parade after the break. 
[02:39:00]  We got some audio from that.  Also, Anthony, just a tease.  Yes.  We'll get into all the local news and the national news after this break.  But here's a tease coming up after the break.  Breast is still best, even if it's dad's.  Yeah.  The story of the day.  All right.  But first, yeah, one of our young go-getters in the studio.  Young go-getter.  His name is Sam.  This is young Sam.  All 115 pounds of him.  Jesus Christ.  He really is a little thin boy.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  How old a lad are you, Sam?  I'm 21, sir.  You're 21?  Yeah.  And you go to college?  Yeah, I go to Syracuse.  You go to Syracuse?  Yeah.  And you're interning for the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes, I am.  You should drop some matches.  See if you can count them real quick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got nothing.  It sounds like a Rain Man.  It was a Rain Man.  Oh, okay.  What are you going to do?  Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I go to Syracuse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, my name's Sam. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Looking forward to a radio career, I gather?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, very good.  Yes.  All right.  And this is where it starts.  I hope so.  This is like the road to radio starts with an internship at a radio show.  Mm-hmm.  And here it is.  And do you know what type of radio-related stuff you'll be doing around here?  Around the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, just, yeah.  Well, involved with this program.  I know the duties include going to stores to get video games.  Exactly.  Uh-huh.  That will be the first mission to teach you about radio, getting Anthony a video game. 
[02:40:30]  Isn't that ridiculous?  I'm looking forward to it.  Why would you possibly, what could you possibly learn about radio by going to CompUSA to get  a video game?  He's got his mind right, though.  Yeah.  Looking forward to it, sir.  Yes, sir.  Looking forward to it, sir.  Mm-hmm.  Yes, sir.  Whatever the mission is, sir.  Okay, what I need is a copy of Star Wars Galaxies.  Yeah.  And it's the total experience package, which means it has all the add-ons in it. 
[02:41:00]  But you're giving them this.  Jump to light speed.  See that?  Yeah, but they shouldn't give them this.  You should take this away.  No, that's okay.  Even if you go out on a recon mission, you know, you at least know what your target kind  of looks like.  That's his map.  You've got to go five clicks.  Five clicks on 57.  Talk to the Puerto Ricans.  Now, you know where CompUSA is?  No, sir.  Oh.  Oh.  I hope somebody will tell me.  Nathaniel knows.  It's right up 57.  He's calling you, sir.  West on 57. 
[02:41:30]  And you'll find it.  Nathaniel will tell you.  He'll brief you.  Great.  Corporal Nathaniel.  We'll brief you.  He's like, corporal, I'm higher than that.  No, you're not.  Nathaniel doesn't call you, sir.  I know.  They lost respect.  After a while, Sam will be calling me dickhead.  They all start like Sam.  I know.  With sir and yes, sir.  And then it's like, ah, asshole.  Thin and cute.  Within a week.  Oh, God.  A full set of hair.  Within a week, they don't even listen to us anymore.  Ah, shut up.  Yeah.  I know.  The overpaid asses.  The first two days, they're all, sir, and then it just falls apart. 
[02:42:00]  And we're just shit again.  All right.  Yeah, it's that one.  Why is he staring at me?  He keeps stealing.  You're looking at me.  I'm looking back at you.  I'm just waiting for you to, Jesus Christ.  Now, if they don't have that, there's a problem, because one of the salespeople there will probably  be able to say, well, we do have the game and the add-ons separately, but no, I need  that package, because you don't get the special speeder, unless you have that package. 
[02:42:30]  Well, that's what I need.  What?  So I can't buy them individually.  No.  I need it in the total experience package.  All right.  What's a special speeder?  It's the speeder to go cruising around so I can go on my missions.  You had to ask.  And luxury and speed.  He's a geek.  And likes his video games.  Luxury and speed.  Luxury and speed.  And how long it takes to walk across Tatooine will take you forever.  True.  That's just real.  He actually has two shirts on.  Yeah, get yourself a protein shake on the way over there. 
[02:43:00]  Eat a couple muffins.  Okay, here you go, sir.  Good luck on your mission.  Are you giving him $100?  Yeah.  Jesus.  How much is the game?  What the hell is this?  The 40s, Opie?  Is that $100?  Whoa!  $100.  Let me see.  I've never seen $100.  Yeah, I know.  But something tells me Opie hasn't seen a couple of those in quite a while.  There you go, Sam.  There you go.  What are you buying land?  Thank you.  What the hell?  Yeah.  A Louisiana purchase.  A Louisiana purchase. 
[02:43:30]  There you go.  I trust you will be successful in your mission.  Absolutely.  I don't know what you'll do if CompUSA doesn't have it.  You need a fallback plan or something?  Maybe Nathaniel can help you out on that.  I hope so.  I hope so, too.  Good luck and Godspeed, Sam.  I'll be with you, Sam.  Thank you.  Have fun.  All right.  Anthony, as we go to break, Family Guy, the AIDS song.  We're getting requests for it.  We played it earlier, but we'll play it again as we go to break.  All right.  In studio, Bill Burr and Bob Kelly filling in and doing a great job for Jim Norton.  Norton, of course, doing the Tonight Show.  Tonight.  Tonight, yeah. 
[02:44:00]  He's doing the Tonight Show.  And we'll have his performance on the show tomorrow, I do believe.  Of course we will.  But first, listen to this.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear, but what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV. 
[02:44:30]  But full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry, I wish it was something less serious.  But it's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the old-day virus. 
[02:45:00]  Live on the Today Show, there's some genetic disaster.  Oh, poor kid.  We're changing the lives of some pretty special kids.  It's a place where we celebrate ability, not disability.  Alicia DeNoon is in remission now.  She had a brain tumor when she was three.  All right, you know what? 
[02:45:30]  I'm turning off the middle.  Oh, God.  I don't even want to be tempted.  Why?  She's in remission.  That's good.  I don't even want to be tempted.  The cute girl petting a dolphin down there in Florida.  Got a bad brain tumor.  God bless her.  Let it be.  Look at that little swimsuit on her.  Thanks, Mom, for that nice genetic handoff.  A brain tumor at three.  Here you go.  Can't be harmful.  Yeah, must have been my smoking, Mom.  Look at that three-year-old get a brain tumor front.  For Mom doing dope.  Nice smile.  Here's a softball in your brain stem, kid. 
[02:46:00]  Get headaches until you're 40.  She's not sure if she's petting a dolphin or a goat.  Take it to a petting zoo, for God's sake.  Mommy, why is the goat in water?  Shh.  It's all right, Puddin' Head.  It's a dolphin.  Puddin' Head.  Oh, is that horrible Puddin' Head.  Ah.  Ah.  It would be funny if you'd get a little shirt for the kids.  I went to the dolphin farm, and all I got was this lousy gene pool. 
[02:46:30]  There you go.  I lost him with the dolphin.  Okay, dear.  Be back later.  Jeff later.  Why do dolphins get pegged with these jobs these days?  You think the dolphin's sitting there like, oh, jeez.  Ah, yeah.  Why can't it be that hot stripper blonde that's on vacation with the other ladies from Hooters?  I used to strap mines to my head, and I put them to enemy boats. 
[02:47:00]  Right.  Now I've got to play with this special child who's drooling on me.  Oh, I remember this.  Isn't this the theme to Flipper?  They call him Flipper, Flipper, swimming with retards.  The one you see is smarter than me.  Smarter than me.  Not the kids he's swimming with.  Balancing their heads on his nose because he thinks it's a big, dumb ball. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, I look under the sea.  Everyone loves the king of the sea.  Oh, jeez.  This is so kind.  This is nice music.  Tricks he will do.  Tricks.  Tries to jump over his big head, but it's too big.  Crashes into the ear and falls back. 
[02:48:00]  Sneets under and bites the kid's foot for making him look bad.  Dolphin almost dies because the kid's big tongue gets stuck in his blowhole.  I can't breathe, kid.  Dolphin.  Puppy.  Pitten.  Yeah, right.  Okay.  That's why the dolphin's jumping out of the water. 
[02:48:30]  He's just saying, get me away from this retard.  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Oh, you'll be my name.  But you'll wait out of the day.  Oh, you'll be my name.  You'll be my name.  And you'll be my name.  You'll be my name.  Oh, you'll be my name.  Oh, you'll be my name.  Oh, you'll be my name. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  In studio today, Bill Burr, Bob Kelly.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for doing your job and helping us get the word out that we're back doing radio again.  And it's growing every day.  It's pretty damn cool.  Puerto Rican Day parade yesterday here in New York City.  Always a lot of controversy.  175 arrested. 
[02:49:30]  Really?  175.  One cop was stabbed.  Jesus.  Stabbing cops?  I guess I was talking to Ben before the show.  You know, the parade goes up, what, Fifth Avenue or something?  That's hilarious that it goes up.  Don't they usually go down?  It's like, yeah, get back up when you were long.  It's like, yeah, you can start the day down here.  But by the end of the day, we'd watch all right back up.  Keep marching.  Keep Lyotas and Hondas back up. 
[02:50:00]  I'm watching it on TV.  I'm like, why is the park on the right-hand side?  It took me a second.  I go, are they marching up now?  They're marching right back up to their natural habitat.  And I usually don't think that way.  But I was in the park yesterday afternoon.  And I was just like, what are these people going home?  I had that feeling, I swear to you.  And I'm not like that.  But it was just so overwhelming.  The Puerto Rican Day Parade always brings a controversy.  This year it was the whole, should the stores board up the fronts of the stores? 
[02:50:30]  They've been doing this every year for the Puerto Rican Day Parade because vandalism.  People taking pisses in the doorways.  Puerto Ricans.  Puerto Ricans more than 10.  That's the only thing.  I mean, they travel in crews of like 48.  And they wear these colors.  That's right.  It's just creepy.  The Puerto Rican Day flag.  No, but there's some guys all in yellow.  There's some guys all in purple.  Yeah, they're called gangs.  As soon as you see a group with the same uniform on, it doesn't matter what it is.  There's trouble. 
[02:51:00]  Even if it's a bunch of girls in softball uniforms, you know there's trouble to be had.  There's going to be trouble.  Somebody's getting raped.  You've just got to stay away from people that are all wearing the same shit.  It doesn't matter if it's girls or the Latin kings.  This year, Mike Bloomberg said, well, why don't we stop boarding up the stores?  He said, it's not fair to the...  They don't do it when the Irish are right.  Obviously, his building isn't on Fifth Avenue.  Yeah, obviously.  Yeah, because it would be a different case if his building was right there. 
[02:51:30]  And, of course, we remember the episode, the fondling and the sexual assault, the wilding that happened a few years back.  Is that when they started boarding up the stores after the rapes?  I think so.  I think it was after the rapes they decided it was time to start boarding up their stores.  Yeah.  Like they didn't have a reason.  There were so many police out yesterday.  It was unbelievable.  And they still had 170 people arrested.  So, you know, you could just imagine if the police decided to take yesterday off and what would happen in this city.  You know what the problem is? 
[02:52:00]  The guys get all drunk.  They drink.  There are gangs of them.  They do travel around in huge gangs.  They are Puerto Rican.  We get it, Bob.  With the different colors.  Two jokes today.  Is Rush Limbaugh coming in in a second?  That's it.  You got these people.  It's a bunch of Puerto Ricans down here.  You got two punchlines today.  He wants to suck some guy's cock in their Puerto Ricans.  I want to suck a Puerto Rican's cock.  You know what?  I'm trying to tell you guys something, and you're not hearing me. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, we're hearing you, dude.  Look at Bob.  Look at Bob.  He trims his goatee there like a Latino.  Yeah, a Latino.  If he just put one of those flags on his head, you could have been there, Bob.  Raping.  Rape.  Rob.  But the guys get a little intoxicated.  They're in gangs.  You know, they're wearing those colors for a reason.  They're representing, you know, the gangs.  And the women, dressing like, I believe they call it the hoochie mama outfit.  Wearing little halter tops. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, they were.  Tits are hanging out.  They were looking fine yesterday.  Little Daisy Dukes with ash cheeks hanging out.  And the guys get all worked up about this.  They look, and they want to touch.  They freak out, and they start what they call their wilding.  I got to grab that ass.  I need to grab tits.  I need that ass.  You know, you might think for a second you might act rationally and walk around, but then you see the ass, and you need it.  In defense of Puerto Ricans, who doesn't grab an ass during a parade?  You got it.  It's right there.  You reach out.  At the very least, the back of the hand, accidental brush. 
[02:53:30]  That's what happens.  Anytime I'm watching St. Paddy's Day Parade, I see a girl wearing the green derby on her head.  I got a little green skirt.  I got to reach and grab that ass.  Scottish guy goes by with a kilt.  Yeah, you know, you reach underneath.  Why not?  Honk, honk.  Give him a little squeeze.  Play his bagpipe.  Sure.  But Ben was saying they were boxing in entire buildings on the east side.  Yeah, they were like encasing them in plywood.  Plywood all the way around the whole damn thing to keep the riffraff out. 
[02:54:00]  I mean, of course you have to.  You have to.  They do have a proven record of misconduct at their parade.  Yeah, it's not like, it's, you know.  Well, we got audio from the Puerto Rican parade.  If they went up and they were just like, you know, but they're honking the horns, you know.  Honking the horns.  That's a 60-year-old white dude.  They're honking the horns.  Honking the horns.  Knock it off with the horn.  Hey.  Hey, you kids.  With their music. 
[02:54:30]  With their music and their clothes.  Oh, and they're eating.  What do they keep?  What do they keep?  They have braids.  The men have braids.  What is that?  Archie, come here.  Wearing ponytails in our day.  Now that Sosa's not hitting homers anymore, like he used to, what are they keeping track  of on their Toyotas and stuff?  Oh, what do you write on the back window with soap nowadays?  He's actually, he's Dominican.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're like write stuff in soap on their back windows.  I don't know what it is.  And then, yeah, the cars are wrapped in various flags, bandanas. 
[02:55:00]  Tell them, Fred.  I invented that.  Robin.  Well, we got some audio, Anthony, from the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  All right.  All right.  Translator?  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please follow the police.  Oh, sorry.  I don't believe that was from me.  I'm sorry.  I'm scared of you.  I thought this was audio from the audience.  I thought you really had audio.  That's from the bodega.  Why don't we have audio?  Bodega.  Why are there bodegas? 
[02:55:30]  Why is there a bodega?  It's not.  It's a deli.  It's day and age.  Jew broad.  Prejudice against the bodegas.  I actually do have audio from the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  Shout out to people all day.  You do.  It's going to help me out here, Henry.  It's Puerto Ricans.  Got a bod at my store.  Let me hear the deer, Ma.  The paw.  Here we go.  I have to represent the Puerto Rico.  That's my country.  That's where I'm from.  I love it.  I'm the only thing to get here.  Anyway, bunk, train, wherever. 
[02:56:00]  To get here.  Why are you so stupid?  Why?  I mean, come on.  What is that?  I love Puerto Rico.  Most of these people have never been to Puerto Rico.  No.  No.  But they were walking around with the flags and stuff yesterday.  They're very proud people.  They are very proud.  They're very proud.  They're proud.  There's nothing wrong with that.  No, nothing wrong with that.  I don't want to see Miguel Cotto.  I'm his mama.  But you got to get, at least they are Puerto Ricans.  As opposed to like, on like the Irish, the St. Patrick's Day Parade.  People are like, you know, I'm fucking one-eighth Irish, and they got a green plastic hat on 
[02:56:30]  their head.  And it's not like they're not pissing in stores.  The green plastic hat.  And if we had a skin tone that looked good to dance like a whore, dress like a whore,  I mean, you know what I mean?  You would.  You don't want to see an Irish ass and fucking veins pulsing out of her thighs.  You see the blood pumping through her body.  You don't want to see that.  That's the only reason why.  You can see vital organs right through the skin.  You see her belly button connected to her asshole.  Her complexion like saran wrap. 
[02:57:00]  You want to have fun in this city?  Have the Puerto Rican Day Parade and the St. Patrick's Day Parade on the same day.  Oh, there you go.  No, and have them march towards each other.  With knives and...  Looked like a five points.  A shillelagh and knives.  Here you go.  All right, more audio from the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  I feel everybody should just come out here and have fun.  Because that's what it's about.  I mean, all the coaches together join the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  It doesn't matter what, we all got love for everybody.  Love for everybody. 
[02:57:30]  See?  There's love.  That's stabbing.  Interview one of the guys.  Yeah.  I want to tell you I want to fuck one of these girls right now.  I say that to you right now, Mr. Lose Man.  Why do people stay in your fucking apartment?  Lose Man, I'm going to fucking rub a bodega.  I'm going to fuck its cat.  And then I'm going to fuck your girlfriend.  Tony, you want to jump?  You want to jump?  Let's go to Anthony in the Bronx.  Anthony.  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Hey.  I just want to let you know, I live up in the Bronx here.  I'm just a normal little white kid.  I just want to let you know, yesterday was the quietest day with all those dirty sticks 
[02:58:00]  down to the beach.  See?  There we go.  Jesus.  You're not ready.  There we go.  You're just not ready to do a radio show yet.  No.  What the fuck you six speak for, huh?  Jesus.  All right.  Wow.  You can always depend on the callers, can't you?  Always depend on them to just...  See?  This is exactly what I said.  We're going through the show.  Here we go.  I'm going to feel like...  And now you're going to leave going, what was that?  Why do I do that?  Why do I go there? 
[02:58:30]  It's going so well.  What happened?  I don't hate Puerto Rico.  I thought this time we finally have a normal radio show.  Nope.  This is the time of the show we should bring in a traffic girl, a weather girl, you know?  Yeah.  And tag.  Let's shout our blessings that we made it through this much of the show.  And go nice.  Play it safe.  What kind of respectable white person still has to live in the Bronx?  All right.  Here we go.  I don't think that anybody in the Puerto Rican Day Parade should be starting parties.  And anyway, everybody's just here to have fun.  All right. 
[02:59:00]  Here to have fun.  That's what we hear.  Anthony, here is the mayor of our fine city talking about the Puerto Rican Day Parade.  Listen to what he had to say.  By executive order of the mayor of the city of New York, today everybody is a little bit  Puerto Rican.  Uh-oh.  I thought you were going to say a little scared.  Awesome.  Do we all get our knives?  Oh, Jesus.  Do we get a bandana and a knife?  What kind of proclamation is that for the mayor to make?  We all get to lower our cars to the ground.  We get to take our bananas and fry them. 
[02:59:30]  Put a spoiler on a Toyota Corolla.  All right.  It's going to do 250 miles an hour.  Oh, and then you customize the muffler so it sounds like it makes 600 horsepower.  The big, fat muffler's got to go on there.  You've got to tint the windows with paint.  Hang an eight-foot Puerto Rican flag out the window.  The flag?  Yeah.  Then you need the little...  Held up by your nine-year-old son.  Sticking out of the sunroof.  Barrigo! 
[03:00:00]  Wack, wack, wack, wack.  Crown air freshener that goes on your dashboard.  Yeah, yeah.  Looks like a crown.  Yeah, yeah.  That just spells trouble.  Jesus.  Jesus.  I love that.  One of my favorite things was the Jesus Christ stencil headlight.  Where I saw the headlight and the stencil on there was our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  It's great.  It's right there on the headlight.  Yeah.  He has a platinum, like a six-inch cross around his neck and he's never been to church.  He just raped a chick in the park.  Jesus.  Viva Parrigo! 
[03:00:30]  Kisses the cross before he goes raping.  He does the sign of the...  No, Father, Sonny, Spirit, amen.  Hold this.  I'm going to fuck you.  Like Jesus told me, I'm going to...  All right, why don't we go from one mayor to another, Anthony?  What the fuck?  We're going to change the direction of the show.  Oh!  Well, the reason we got two Boston guys in the studio, it's another bit we like to do, guys.  Bill Burr and Bob Kelly.  We're going to talk about the championship.  We're going to talk about the championship.  And Bob Kelly.  No.  No.  I'm sorry.  We got Mayor Menino Clips, the mayor of Boston. 
[03:01:00]  We found out he's been the mayor since 92, 93, I guess.  Opie, I just wanted to say to you.  And we had no idea.  We all knew that he mumbled, but we had no idea that he...  No, he's a speech impediment.  Well, it's worse than that.  He just speaks horrendously.  He has a Down Syndrome tongue.  Huge hunk of tongue.  Like that retarded guy tongue that just flops out.  Big and fat.  It makes this sound.  I want the J to contribute to the Patriot J.  We are going to root on our results. 
[03:01:30]  Gunny Damon, in my favorite...  Does he sound sweaty?  Yeah.  Just, ugh.  Big fat tongue.  Fat body.  Well, we have examples of him speaking just horribly.  You've got to hear some of these.  Oh, we'll translate.  You'll translate?  Yeah, let's try.  Commissioner Evans leaves us with a record of steady progress.  Leaves us.  Right there, he was inserting his own echo.  I wanted to sound more important.  Leaves us.  Leaves us.  I'm feeling like my child, my child. 
[03:02:00]  Progress.  Oh, that's awful.  What is he?  He's our mayor?  No.  Well, it's one of the great traditions of Boston.  St. Patrick's Day breakfast, and Jackie Haas did a great job for the first time ever.  Everybody said he couldn't do it.  Well, he's Rosen to the occasion again.  Rosen?  He's just done a great job.  And, you know, the governor and Jim O'Brien, they've all been good morning, great jokes,  and great time. 
[03:02:30]  What?  He stopped.  He went.  He stopped in the middle.  Rosen to the occasion.  Rosen.  He knew he fucked up.  Risen.  Risen.  And in the middle of occasion, he went.  Rosen.  Rosen to the.  Choking on his own tongue.  You've got to get him to Heinleck every so often just to get his own tongue out of his throat.  When I was a boy, my tongue got cut off, and they replaced it with a cow tongue.  Cow.  What kind of tongue is that?  Cow.  It's a cow tongue, and I have to speak like this.  My tongue is too big for my mouth. 
[03:03:00]  Huge.  Here's another example.  The Boston Public Health Commission has also created an emergency preparedness guide called  Live, Learn, Prepare.  Prepare.  Live, Learn, Prepare.  He's had a limb on his head.  Why would you spell that the same?  I look like an idiot.  Why is Live and Live spelled the same way?  Is that amazing?  Can't you put something else in there like a P or an L?  Oh, there is an L. 
[03:03:30]  Maybe a Q or an R.  The simplest name for a program.  He didn't say called.  He said call.  Call.  Call.  Listen to it again.  Live.  This is the mayor of Boston.  The Boston Public Health Commission has also created an emergency preparedness guide  called Live, Learn.  Prepare.  You know what?  I like to pause.  He thought.  Like, is that Live or Live?  I'm going live.  Live.  Prepare.  Does anybody say anything?  No.  Nobody said anything. 
[03:04:00]  No one says a word.  The guy who came up with the name for this fucking program didn't go.  It's fucking Live.  It's the emperor's new words.  You moron.  No one wants to tell him.  We do this from time to time, and you'll hear people starting to laugh in the background  because they're press conferences and stuff, and you know they're laughing at him and not  with him.  He's the worst Boston accent, too.  Oh.  That's what I'm into.  Prepare.  Prepare.  Live.  Learn.  Prepare.  Prepare.  Where.  Where.  Where.  Who is this?  Who is this over there?  I broke my knee, man. 
[03:04:30]  He should be doing Bernie and Phil commercials.  Bernie and Phil.  That's old school, but Bernie.  I had a nightmare, Dr. Phil.  Well, Bernie, maybe if you slept on his wonderful sofa.  Or you'd get a recliner.  It's two recliners for one, Bernie.  Furniture discount.  Some of our fans in Boston have to send in the audio of the Bernie and Phil commercial.  Hey, Phil.  We used to love those things.  Oh, they dress up.  It's like a couple of local people.  You have them in your city.  A couple of goofballs that own a furniture store that do their own commercials. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, Jordans.  They're always wacky.  Oh, they're always wacky.  Yeah, why a furniture store?  People have to be zany.  Hey, we're just like Disneyland.  They have a, Jordan's has a ride.  Yeah, yeah, I've been there.  You're supposed to go there on a Saturday night.  Instead of going out on the town to dinner, you go to a fucking furniture store.  Furniture store.  And they have like a main street built in their store that was like building, where  it's like Disney if you go into like a, uh, Pirates of the Caribbean.  Without any of the fun.  It's a fucking furniture store.  You're still in a furniture store. 
[03:05:30]  Okay, how many rides and attractions they put in?  Remember that guy, uh, uh, Light and Leisure?  The purple building?  Uh, no.  Oh, it's going too far back?  Yeah, probably.  You know what?  I'm going to still plow through with this.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  He's one of these guys, like, he always fucks up his inventory.  Oh, all right, all right.  And he's always coming up with a zany wig.  I don't believe what I did this time.  I got 58 end tables.  And I only got room for two.  I'm selling them for $8 each.  I don't know what I'm doing. 
[03:06:00]  Every fucking two weeks.  It's like, why don't you?  You're practically giving them away.  Yeah, why don't you fire yourself?  Maybe hire somebody else to do your inventory.  Even the building, it's purple.  It's crazy.  They're sticking out against the fucking background.  Bernie and Phil would always do sketches.  They would do like sketches.  I pulled that out.  That was very good.  We used to love Bernie.  Actually, they pulled it out.  The cowboy sketch.  Yeah, they would dress like cowboys.  Or the western sketch.  And the other one was where Bernie was on a shrink couch. 
[03:06:30]  And Phil, it's a guy and a girl.  Husband and wife team.  Phil is Phyllis.  It's a woman.  So he was laying there.  And he's a shrink.  And he goes, I had a nightmare, Dr. Phil.  What was it, Bernie?  I dreamt our furniture wasn't the lowest price furniture you could get in Boston.  Oh, shut up.  We used to do so many parodies of that commercial.  They were a cartoon, too, right?  Didn't they have a cartoon? 
[03:07:00]  They did some cartoons.  I saw that one.  Oh, that was Building 19.  We just have the worst stores.  Bernie and Phil.  Oh, we used to goof on them.  Hey, Phil.  You know, hey, Phil.  Your tits look like this beanbag chair.  That is also on sale here.  For 1995.  Hey, I just fucked Bernie on your new recliner sofa.  My sack hangs so low, I use it as an ornament for this couch.  My cock looks like an L-shaped sofa.  Let's go back to the Mayor Menino clips here. 
[03:07:30]  Another example of the mayor speaking just wonderfully.  And Citizens Bank is offering low-cost loans.  What?  What?  What?  They're offering a Scissor Bank?  I forget it.  Well, they translate for us, too.  At one point, he said low-incist loans.  Low-incist.  Citizens Bank.  What bank?  Citizens Bank.  Let's listen to the Scissor Bank.  Scissor Bank.  Scissor Bank.  You know, if someone follows around with a tape recorder or whatever, we'd all have 
[03:08:00]  examples of speaking, you know, horrendously, right?  But we have hundreds of these.  This isn't just, you know, a little thing.  Yeah, but he's also speaking to a crowd.  That's right.  He's a mayor.  And he knows he's being recorded.  He's a public speaker.  There's cameras and mics in his face.  Citizens Bank.  He'd rehearse the name of the bank.  What is it?  Citizens.  Citizens.  It's Citizens.  Low-incist.  Here it is.  Sir, it's Citizens.  Here it is again.  And Citizens Bank is offering low-cost loans.  Low-interest, low-cost loans. 
[03:08:30]  He doesn't even acknowledge.  Just plow through.  Listen to this one.  This one's hilarious.  I really cared about what he said.  He wasn't just saying the words like a lot of elected officials or former elected officials  would do.  He was a man of a great, great statue in our city.  A man of great statue.  There you go.  Of course he is.  A man of great statue.  I love him.  He sounds better when he whispers, though.  Yeah, like he sounded more like he was...  A little retarded.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  When he's doing...  A little subdued.  How are you?  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand, man.  We go over the air and it's a statue.  He's a statue, man.  A man of great statue.  He's a great man of statue.  And he silhouettes himself.  This is Vank.  We've got to get to the 78-year-old man in a sec, too.  I just saw that.  We didn't talk about that.  Here's one more.  Maybe one or two more examples.  Why would you go to Miami?  Hot.  Summer.  Wow.  Wow.  That was his attempt at humor. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Why would you go to Miami?  Hot.  Summer.  Hot.  Hot.  Summer.  Wow.  Summer.  Summer.  Wow.  I didn't get...  Was he trying to make fun of Miami?  He was reading the commas.  Miami, or was he...  I think it's part of the push to come up to Boston for the summer.  When you go to Cape Cod.  Yeah.  Go to Cape Cod.  Go to Cape Cod.  Go to Cape Cod.  Hyannis.  Hyannis.  Right.  Go to the vineyard.  Oh, my God.  Hot.  Summer.  Wow.  We shouldn't be talking about the settlement, you know?  I mean, settlement is money, monetary. 
[03:10:00]  I think it's more important to think about the family.  What the fuck?  Money, monetary.  I didn't even get any of that.  Money, monetary or something.  Money.  Sentiment?  Cement?  I have no idea what he was talking about in that clip.  All right.  Let's try it again.  Let's try to listen in.  More guys can figure this out.  We shouldn't be talking about the settlement, you know?  I mean, settlement is money, monetary.  I think it's more important to think about the family.  Settlement?  Wow.  Settlement?  Monetary.  Monetary.  Some girls named Mona and Terry. 
[03:10:30]  And money that they got.  I have no idea what that fat-tongued idiot is talking about.  Fat-tongued idiot.  Because you guys are here, Steve is getting some more.  Because this is right down your alley, being from Boston.  I just want to...  Did we talk about the breast thing?  No.  No.  This is another one of these studies.  Man, you know, you kind of yearn for the old days.  When mom did what she was doing, and dad did what he was doing, and that was it, and now there's a lot of crossover stuff.  The gray area is getting wider and wider. 
[03:11:00]  This has gone too far.  Yeah.  Some studies saying a man's nipples are perfectly suited to soothing a crying baby until it can be fed, according to a report on fatherhood.  Yeah.  Your fucking wife could talk you into that.  Oh, I know.  You are the most pussy whipped.  It's bad enough.  You're a hairy nipple.  Yeah, that's the...  I'm going to tell you right now.  That's not going to horrify the truth.  When women are fucking you over is when they get you to do something, and then they go, you know, if you do that, you're a real man. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  A real man would do this.  A real man would let an infant...  Suckle.  ...on his fucking breast.  Yep, Carolyn Flint, the former president of the Royal College of Midwives, said that she has come across many examples of British men suckling their babies,  even though it might not be something they talked about very much.  She said it's not a case of a man saying to the baby, hey, you, have my boobie, but it's usually the baby snuffling along the father's chest, finding the nipple, and sucking. 
[03:12:00]  The men are usually very surprised, but the babies seem content.  I think you were supposed to whisper that.  A report estimates that this is increasing.  It obviously doesn't give them any nourishment, but it soothes them, calms them until mommy can get there.  Let it cry.  Yeah, right.  What happened with just cry until your mother gets here?  Imagine some of these tough construction workers that work in New York going home and doing this on the side. 
[03:12:30]  Or, you know, that used to be, women breastfeeding was something very closed door for many years, but now it's a lot of controversy.  It's become very public.  Could you see that?  You know, or just, you know, a father sitting there breastfeeding his child or breast letting it suckle.  What happened to a nook?  The little noobie or whatever the hell the kid calls it.  It's probably so hard not to look when a woman's doing that in public.  Oh, I know.  You're really looking for any sort of areola.  Right.  You have to.  It's uncomfortable.  You don't want to stare, but they're doing it. 
[03:13:00]  And then if you say it's uncomfortable, they say they have a right to do it, but then you're gawking.  I think what Bill's saying, though, I mean, I think, what he's saying, you want to see the chick's tit.  Right.  Of course.  It's just another free tit shot.  Minus the baby.  You want to see the tit.  You know?  Where's young Eric?  Eric, because there's a family guy scene.  I wonder if we have it, where Peter is breastfeeding Stewie.  Do we have that clip?  Peter breastfeeding Stewie?  If you're breastfeeding, though, if you're suckling your child and you're a man, you are, you're like completely pussy whipped. 
[03:13:30]  And it's bad enough what some guys, all guys, I'm sorry, have to do once there are kids in their lives.  It's just a shame to see it.  I went this weekend to my cousin.  My cousin is a father now.  His daughter's first birthday was over my aunt's house this weekend.  So we went there.  I know.  I'm totally flustered.  I'm flustered.  He fucked a woman.  She got pregnant. 
[03:14:00]  Let me get to the point.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a stuttered, muttering ass.  Citizens.  But he's a guy, you know, he just likes to do what he likes to do.  Go to work, around on computers, whatever.  He was doing things over the weekend like glazing potted plants to give out to people.  Go, setting up a running chocolate fountain to dip marshmallows in and stuff.  And this just isn't him.  It's not.  But when you're a father and it's a one-year birthday party, just think you have to throw 
[03:14:30]  a one-year birthday party.  It's something you don't want to do.  The kid isn't going to know.  He doesn't know.  He's, of course not.  And he shouldn't be having it.  He's there with the camera and this over there.  And he's walking around videotaping a big Elmo costume comes into the backyard and bubbles  are flying around the back.  That's all for the other parents.  Baby starts crying.  Oh, of course.  That's all to impress the other parents.  They're friends.  I love how Ann talks about this like it's some foreign thing that no one really knows about.  No, it's just an experience you don't ever want to have. 
[03:15:00]  Guys don't want a structure in case there's some sort of weather that he doesn't get  guys out there like, yeah, so I've done this a hundred times.  You're just talking to a guy who just gave the kid a hundred bucks to get a video game.  I just love how Anthony can't even fathom ever doing any of this stuff.  No, I am too selfish.  I am too selfish.  I just enjoy doing what I want.  At the drop of a hat, I want to be able to go to Foxwoods.  I want to be able to hang out all weekend. 
[03:15:30]  If I'm supposed to be back for something and I don't have to be back, I'll go, ah, I'll stay  another day.  You know, the thought of having to traipse around an armored personnel carrier full of  machinery on every road trip you take, there's the play pens and toys, you've got to load  them up.  I see my friends and relatives, before they go anywhere, they've got to load everything  at the top of the stairs.  It's like a mission they've got to go on.  They have a bunch of those bags, those canvas bags.  Oh, the canvas bags with the zippers and little compartments with diapers and the wipes. 
[03:16:00]  Everything's got to be wiped.  They've got little baby logos on the side of it.  I was hanging out with a bunch of people this weekend, and while we were waiting for this  one girl to take a dump so we could go out, I swear to God, it was a bunch of us just  hanging out.  Well, I guess that's a side story, but this girl has irritable bowel syndrome or something,  so we were all supposed to go to this cool little town and eat and then go drinking  and stuff, but we couldn't.  We had to order food because she can't go to the bathroom in public, so we had to order  pizza so she could eat, and then we had to wait a half hour so she could take a dump, 
[03:16:30]  and then we could finally leave.  And she tells the whole party this.  No one knows her.  We're all just meeting people for the first time.  Maybe she introduced it to Jimmy.  Yeah, really.  But we had to sit around and wait for her to take a dump.  But anyway, there's a young couple there.  They're getting married, I guess, in August or September, and the guy's like, yeah, you  know, I'm never getting a minivan, and everyone just started openly laughing at the guy, because  everyone thinks that's, they'll be the guy that escapes not getting the minivan. 
[03:17:00]  I'm keeping my Trans Am.  Yeah, sure you are.  I was talking to my girl the other day, how, like, if you buy a Corvette and you're in your  40s, people automatically, oh, he's got a mid-life crisis.  Really?  When was I supposed to buy that?  When I was 18?  McDonald's?  Fucking moron.  Maybe now I can finally afford the goddamn thing, and I'm not so pussy whipped that I'm  going to go out and go buy a van.  Like you.  And if you have a van, you're not going to get any pussy.  Right.  So they know if you drive up in that car, women are going to be interested, so they've  got to attack you. 
[03:17:30]  God, is that great, though?  I never even thought of that.  That's a great bit.  Oh, look at that guy.  He's going out with a young girl.  Mid-life crisis.  Yeah.  I was supposed to do that at 20?  Go out with an eight-year-old?  If you buy a Rolls Royce off of eBay, that's a mid-life crisis.  What a dope.  What a dope.  Which boss?  Where else are you supposed to buy?  What did he do?  Oh, my God.  You haven't heard the latest on Red Horse?  A Rolls Royce off eBay.  eBay.  Billy, go check him out.  So he sends... 
[03:18:00]  It's an investment.  So he sends the guy in Florida $1,000 through PayPal as a deposit on this because, of course,  he doesn't want anyone else to buy.  He's coming.  There's no car.  He goes down there to test drive it, and the thing breaks down twice while he's driving  it.  And it doesn't look like the picture.  And it smelled like sausage.  Like a Plymouth?  Like an old car and some kind of sausage, he said.  Sausage sauerkraut smell.  Yes, sauerkraut.  It was just a mess.  It was not worth...  So he wanted his money back.  Now he's had to go through PayPal, and the guy isn't giving him his money back. 
[03:18:30]  And he's been taken for $1,000.  You know what it is?  Voss knows that no matter how nice a car, how nice a suit, he still looks like a dirt  bag.  He's still Rich Voss.  He just...  But why are Rolls Royce?  Because he thinks he's classy.  He thinks he's going to be a class act.  That's what he means, classy.  I'm going to pull up in a Rolls Royce.  I don't know who I am.  He's thinking about five years down the road.  I'm going to do proms now.  Yeah.  I'm going to do comedy, and I'm going to drive the kids around. 
[03:19:00]  Hey, kids, you ready?  Here's the show.  I think he's coming in tomorrow or Friday.  He's coming in tomorrow.  He is.  Oh, I've got to grill him on this if he's got his money back.  But who buys a Rolls Royce off of eBay?  Who buys a fucking car off of eBay?  Who buys a car off of eBay?  I don't even want to buy a baseball car off of eBay.  And then he was saying, I'm looking at it as an investment, because then I could sell  it for a lot more.  So now he's a used car salesman.  He's Rich Voss, the used car salesman.  Oh, my God.  This is the guy with the missing toe?  That's Pat from Munaki. 
[03:19:30]  Pat from Munaki.  What is Pat doing here?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  I like his fake, wacky energy.  Look who just walked in.  That's him.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Pat.  How you doing?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I see you got your O&A shirt.  Spread the virus shirt.  This is the official O.P. and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt.  That's right.  And there's no more, because there wasn't enough material to make any more.  Jesus, what is that?  O.P. is in the t-shirt business.  Is that like an 8XL or something?  No, it's only 4XL. 
[03:20:00]  4XL.  All right.  He looks like he should be eating it like the turnbuckle.  I am a professional eater now.  Yes, yes, he is.  Don't mess with this guy.  What do you?  He's in the hot dog eating contest.  He's representing the show.  You know what I love?  His complete lack of confidence in his jokes.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's his whole bit.  That's the whole gag.  That's the whole Pat from the Rocky bit.  He tells his little joke, and then you'll notice him just go something like,  Well, here's my pathetic attempt.  I like how his eyebrows go up, too, right at the punchline.  He has no confidence. 
[03:20:30]  Like a magician.  There, he's got nothing.  What do you got in your hand?  Nothing.  My little videotape from...  Oh, quick before he eats it.  There's actually a VHS tape in his hand.  It just looks like a digital.  It looks like a mini DVD.  Harry.  Regular size.  Harry.  That old guy.  No, this is my tape from when I did my qualifier in Philadelphia.  He qualified for the Coney Island hot dog eating contest. 
[03:21:00]  He's in the contest.  Did you go up against an Asian, or did you go up against other Americans?  No, surprisingly, there was an Asian in it, but he only ate like eight hot dogs.  Was he a little guy?  Like a black guy with a small dick.  You know, was he a little guy?  Hey, now.  Gotta wait for the eyebrows on that one.  You know.  That tells you, it's like an applause sign.  Applause.  That's actually funny.  That isn't bad.  You know what?  The big guy never wins the eating contest.  Yeah.  Do you know why?  Do you know why?  Why?  Because there's so much... 
[03:21:30]  The fat belt.  Oh, sorry.  No, it's all right.  Go ahead.  It's called the fat belt.  He explained this to us.  The fat inside holds the stomach down.  Keeps it from expanding.  Skinny guys can expand.  Mm-hmm.  Can it go down and up your stomach and stretch out and come out your ass?  Well, when I tried training by drinking two gallons of water...  He's training now for this.  Yeah.  I almost passed out.  Really?  The lights went light and everything.  I go, oh, you guys shouldn't be doing this.  The lights went light.  Because it wipes away all your electrolytes.  The lights went light. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  And this Saturday I'm doing it for money.  When water makes you pass out.  I bet if he drank a case of berry he'd be fucking fine.  And could drive down the road.  Yeah, when water makes you pass out.  Get a gallon of water in me.  I had an apple and I lost a foot.  Dangerous.  What are you doing this weekend?  I never thought I'd say this, but this Saturday I'm going to have salty balls in my mouth.  No confidence the head moves.  It's like the head's going, huh, come on.  Anything?  He was a lot there. 
[03:22:30]  What time for you?  In Vaudeville.  Yeah.  Wait, you're doing an eating contest?  What is it?  Yeah, it's for money, too.  While strolling through the park one day.  Hey, did you hear the one about the chocolate balls in my mouth?  In the very merry month of...  With an umbrella.  A top hat.  I really want to get a saw and slap him in the face.  Yeah.  Wow.  Moe.  Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop.  What's that?  What's salty balls?  They're like boiled potatoes. 
[03:23:00]  Boiled potatoes.  And they serve them in dog balls at a place called Maui's.  And it's a contest?  In Wildwood?  Yeah.  And if you finish the most, what do you win?  $2,500.  Oh.  Yeah.  Second place is $1,500.  And then third place is $1,000.  There's a whole business in this for you.  This is a whole new form of income.  Yeah.  What kind of people go and...  That's if I win, because this is going to bring out the heavy hitters.  Yeah.  Pardon the expression.  Meh.  With that kind of money on the line, yeah. 
[03:23:30]  Well, you know, that'll bring all the big Jersey eaters.  Yeah.  And where is the cutoff point for being in the money?  Third place?  Third place, yeah.  Third place, and then fourth, you just leave with what you ate.  Yeah.  Wow.  Has anybody ever gotten sick?  Like that, like...  I'm sure people have, yeah.  Puking.  Well, they have all...  If you belong to the IFOC, the International Federation of Competitive Eating, they have safety  standards, somewhat, of having an EMS guy there. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, really?  I like walking up to the EMS guy.  You guys ready to pick me up?  And they...  You see that laugh?  That was nothing.  Walk up to the guy and say, hey...  I know it's not funny.  Hey, I'm going to...  You guys ready to...  You guys ready to shock my heart?  I hope you got air shocks in the back of that ambulance.  They'll take two hot dogs.  Stay clear.  Five minutes?  Let him do it at a club.  Yeah.  He was in our...  You said, like, the best comedy we can come up with. 
[03:24:30]  The audience should get hot dogs and they can throw them at him.  Yeah.  No, just say, everybody donates a joke that always works in your act.  Right.  That's a great idea.  And then you have him fucking tell it.  I could ruin it, though.  Yeah.  That's the thing.  That's the...  Jesus.  All right, Pat, we're going to let you go.  So, we're hearing you got to...  People are telling us you got to go.  Yeah, people are saying you got to let you go.  You got to go.  I'm putting back into David Banner.  Meh.  Hulk music?  Never.  Oh, God.  He was waiting for you to hit a button.  Usually you go...  Yeah, I'll hit a button.  Because it was a...  You ever hear the audio of him puking on our show? 
[03:25:00]  We had an eggnog drinking contest.  How many did you do?  70 double shots of eggnog.  And he won a MiFi, right?  That was way back in the day.  Yeah.  And this is...  This is afterwards.  He made himself puke, because he wasn't even going to puke after that.  He's diabetic, so if he kept it in him, he'd probably lose a whole leg.  Yeah.  So, he had to get rid of it, and he stuck a couple of fingers down.  Oh, dude, yeah.  Opie and Anthony, once again, let's...  Diabetic.  Let's make a big eggnog.  This is the clip.  I'm diabetic.  This clip makes us laugh to this day. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Oh.  When I'm rich, I'll have a fountain in front of my house.  That's only half the audio, by the way.  That's half of it.  He just kept going and going.  Oh, he kept going and going.  So, Saturday, salty balls.  Yep.  All right.  Maui's place.  Isn't that...  Can't you get sick off the potatoes?  Like, sugar.  Well, I'm Irish, so I got potatoes in my blood. 
[03:26:00]  All right.  The contests are only for 12 minutes, so...  Yeah.  All right.  Pat, in honor of that, we're going to play this little ditty for you.  Thank you.  It's Pat from Minaki.  Two tablespoons of cinnamon  And two or three egg whites

Oh, no  He's got to write it  Why can't you talk to me?  Why don't you talk to me?  You never call me 
[03:34:30]  They don't have a microphone in there today  Here comes Derek  Oh, that's it  Now I remember  It said Hitler  Love him or hate him  He killed a lot of Jews  Yeah, but I can't  It's just the worst  T-shirts ever  They're racist, sexist  Just horrible t-shirts  That I couldn't picture  Anyone ever wearing  How did you go  From Dave Chappelle  Because  Because there's a t-shirt  There's a Chappelle t-shirt  That's out there  On t-shirt hell  That's where I was going  It's a picture of Dave Chappelle  And it says  Dave Chappelle  Went to Africa

[03:35:30]  And then we'll try to end  With the 78 year old  Who killed himself  In just a sick  Funny story  Sure, maybe we'll  Yeah, we'll end with  A little fluff  And this guy offed himself  On Max X  We'll end with a little fluff piece  But first  Seems grandpa couldn't take it  More of Mayor Menino  Grandma's got the whole room  To her set  All right, well  We might as well do the story  There we go  What the hell  Let's see  Queens man sets himself on fire  A 78 year old Queens man 
[03:36:00]  Doused himself with gasoline  And set himself ablaze  Early yesterday  Dying just yards from his home  When we got to the scene  We found his walker  Next to the can of gasoline  A walker  And a can of gas  And an old burnt corpse  78 years old  He was in the middle  Of the street  By the way  When they found him  How bad  Is life  Has it gotten  At 78  That  An option  Of a good way out  Is to douse yourself  In gas  And burn yourself alive 
[03:36:30]  They said  He walked out  Of his Lewiston Avenue home  With the aid  Of an aluminum walker  Just after 5 a.m.  Walked into the street  Doused himself  He's probably  So sick of using that thing  He just wanted to walk  On his own  So unable to be able  To do that again  He literally had to  Light himself  Because you're going to walk  I'm walking  I'm walking  You are going to walk  There's going to be some  He probably ran  Yeah  First time since the depression  There's like 12 ashy footprints  On the drive  I feel so young 
[03:37:00]  Energized  Neighbors gathered  On the corner to grieve  Listen to this one neighbor  He was a very nice man  Who loved his family  Said a family friend actually  And then it goes on to say  Something like this  Always makes people surprised  Well  Something like this  Like it happens all the time  Right  Whenever a neighbor of mine  Lights himself on fire  In the street  I'm always a little surprised  By it  Just a tad  He's literally sitting  Well I can't light myself  In the house  I'll burn it down 
[03:37:30]  Yeah  I've got to be considerate  To the family members  He's in a walker  And he's 70  It must have took him  Like at least two hours  To get all this together  With a gas can  Nobody noticed grandpa  Walking to the garage  Filling a gas can  What's grandpa doing?  I don't know  It's something  He's got a can of gas  Some matches  The walker  This brings back a memory  When I was a kid  My sister  Half sister technically  Whatever  But my sister  She inherited some money  From a distant relative  My dad made it sound like  We were going on vacation  To the Catskills 
[03:38:00]  Way up in the Catskills  The guy owned like  Some motels  And a pool  And he had a main house  And the guy died  Because he was smoking  Cigarettes in bed  So we get up there  And my dad goes  Hey you want to come  In the house with me?

[03:39:00]  I tell you  I'll load you up  In the hearse  My dad always had a way  Of spinning things  To make it sound like  It was going to be  The coolest thing  You know  And we all were  Supposed to have  We took the moans  Words for it  Isn't this great  No matter where you are  That's the place to be  So kids  Let's sing  Da na na na  Da na na na  That is a little creepy  We were supposed to all  Have our own motel  Like cabin  You know  And it turned out  We were so scared  That we all stayed in one  And then my mom  You know  Took over the  You know
