<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an introduction by Larry King, before transitioning to a segment featuring Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and likely other staff including Eric ("E-Rod," "Iraq").  The show opened with a discussion of Jim Norton's surprisingly organized hoarding of items from his storage units.  He detailed his meticulous labeling and bubble-wrapping of old computer parts (a nine-year-old Dell monitor, speakers, surge protector, etc.), which he eventually sold on eBay, with the monitor fetching $31.  The conversation expanded to encompass Norton's broader hoarding habits, including clothes (especially concert shirts), cards, and collectibles, often touching upon his past use of selling collectibles to fund his drinking.  Anecdotes about interactions with Dice Clay and Louis C.K. were also shared, interspersed with sexually suggestive and crude humor.

The focus then shifted to Eric, his habit of keeping numerous worn-out items, and speculation about whether a recent sick day was legitimate or a pretext for personal activities like furniture assembly or video gaming.  The hosts and a guest, Troy Kwan, engaged in humorous and often crude debate about Eric's honesty, punctuated by discussions about Bruce Springsteen concert tickets and their acquisition.  A caller identifying as a doctor suggested the criticism of Eric stemmed from his absence.  A graphic phone call from a listener detailing his first homosexual experience was also included.

This discussion of Eric's perceived laziness, dishonesty, and weight continued intensely with Troy Kwan, fueled by online comments labeling Eric a "fat, lazy fuck."  Eric's explanation that his early departures were due to dentist appointments for a broken sleep apnea mouthpiece was met with skepticism and ridicule. Kwan heavily criticized Eric's weight and lack of self-improvement, while defending his own healthy lifestyle, leading to a broader argument about work ethic and personal accountability.  Callers weighed in, with some supporting Eric and others siding with Kwan.  Kwan's upcoming rhinoplasty also became a topic, further fueling the argument with accusations of jealousy over Eric's higher salary and ability to leave early.  Anecdotes about Eric's failed diets and a story about him getting his nose broken after kissing a man for revenge were included. Steve C’s recent emergency room visit following gastric bypass surgery was also mentioned.  The segment concluded with insults, more caller opinions, a brief mention of a new iPad announcement, and a comedic "Bobo Sings the Boss" segment.

The show then moved on to a bet between Opie and Travis regarding the size of the new iPad ($100 escalating to $200), focusing on the "black border" and its effect on perceived size. Opie lost, as the new iPad was slightly thicker.  This was followed by a discussion of Peyton Manning's departure from the Indianapolis Colts, his emotional farewell, future prospects, and contract disputes.  Other sports topics, such as Manning's potential new teams and Jeremy Lin's performance, were briefly mentioned. The discussion also included a sarcastic reference to a Kim Kardashian interview, analysis of "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," and extensive criticism of the "Get Glue" app.  The segment concluded with skepticism about the Invisible Children charity and Joseph Kony, along with a personal anecdote about Opie retrieving old video game consoles from storage.

A segment then focused on a Ugandan conflict, highlighting a viral video and criticizing viewers' lack of further research into the situation.  This transitioned into ribbing and joking about Eric's perceived lack of sharpness and laid-back personality.  A planned garage sale/auction of the hosts' and staff's possessions was discussed, including the previously mentioned monitor.  A listener proposed a bet involving destroying Opie's wrestling figures for a large sum of money.  Continued discussion about Eric's work habits and interactions with Troy, who was perceived as particularly critical of Eric, formed the bulk of the remainder of the segment. The segment ended with a debate on the appropriateness of Troy's critique of Eric's health and lifestyle.

Finally, a heated discussion centered on Eric’s closed-off nature and reluctance to engage in the show's confrontational style. Troy used harsh and profane language, accusing Eric of secrecy and unresponsiveness. Eric defended himself, arguing his openness was comparable to others on the show. Tangents included Roland's erratic behavior (due to Bruce Springsteen tickets and interactions with a woman from XMU radio) and a caller, Scott, calling Troy a "fucking tool."  The argument touched upon Eric's wife and home, and details of Troy's personal life were brought up and contested. The show ended with more profanity, playful threats of a handjob, and announcements for upcoming segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  You get it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard. You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Why is the music so low?  I was going to crank my headphones up.  Why is the music so low?  I don't know.  Eric, why is the music so low? 
[00:01:00]  This is a different file than I normally try.  Oh, no.  Well, crank that shit up.  Dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun.  I think Jimmy's a hoarder.  Morning, morning.  Good morning.  Tim Norton is a hoarder, I think.  Very organized, though.  He's unloading computer parts in the studio this morning.  I'm a controlled hoarder, like, I went through, I'm going through my storage units in my building  to clean my apartment out and put everything in these plastic bins. 
[00:01:30]  It stores nicer, it's safer, it's much easier to handle.  So I've been doing that project for like a week in my spare time.  And I have a couple of computer things from my old Dell.  I have a nice desktop monitor, which happens to be in excellent condition.  And I will throw it out, but if nobody wants it.  I hate to waste a computer monitor that's actually a good shape.  Oh, waste not, want not, Jimmy.  I was going to say that, but I couldn't remember what the expression was.  I kept saying, waste a lot, want something?  No.  And here I have these speakers, but I just threw out a bunch of the old Dell shit. 
[00:02:00]  I'm just amazed how nicely everything's wrapped.  And labeled?  Yeah, put it back so I know.  Labeled, it's bubble wrapped.  The boxes are perfectly put together.  Okay, yeah, nobody wants this computer monitor, so I'll probably get rid of it.  Oh.  What kind of plug does it have?  Like, what is it?  I don't know.  It's not that old.  How old is that Dell monitor?  Probably about, you know what?  I don't know, because I went with my Mac desktop. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  It's got fucking...  All right.  That is a little old.  That is old.  You wouldn't get a lot of money if you were on Antique Roadshow.  No, I'm not going to sell it.  I'll just dump it.  I'm thinking if this went to Antique Roadshow ads.  What would you say if I told you that's worth $3?  How much do you think I would get for that?  I'm not going to sell it.  I'm just going to break it.  I hate to waste it.  That I hate to throw out.  The other Dell shit I didn't mind.  But how you just had a...  Lawn Stars, you'd be gone. 
[00:03:00]  You know, it's going to take me.  It's going to be in the shop too long.  I really...  You know, no one's looking for these these days.  You can't just break the monitor how it was just nicely in that box and in the bubble wrap  and all the labeling and you see those wires.  Oh, yeah.  Who can't though?  The wires are...  There's different...  There sure is a different USB now.  You just plug in USB and there's your monitor.  You don't need those big...  What were those connections called? 
[00:03:30]  What are they called, Mars?  You're an engineer.  They're called old.  Oh, look what I almost threw out.  Oh, my God.  What the hell is that?  That's from like the 50s.  No, these are very needed, right?  That's a surge protector.  Circuit breaker.  From your...  Yeah, yeah.  I'll probably save this.  This is actually what I'll use.  Yeah.  You can save that, Jimmy.  Why is it all yellow?  Because it's old.  It's probably cum.  Right.  If it was your computer...  Yeah, that monitor's probably got like fucking...  You could clone Jimmy if you just scraped the front of it. 
[00:04:00]  Why don't you sign it?  A listener certainly will fucking...  I want 5,000 for it.  Hey, Jim.  Yes.  If you hang on to this monitor another year, you can celebrate its 10-year anniversary.  Oh, my God.  Is that a nine-year-old monitor?  It's nine years old.  A nine-year-old monitor?  You know how old that is in computer talk?  Wowee.  That's like 100 years old.  I think somebody takes good care of his stuff, doesn't they?  Yes.  Yes, Jimmy's also got a dot matrix printer and a 14-4 modem if anybody needs it.  Hold on.  Look what else I have.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before we move on, though, that monitor has seen a lot of porn. 
[00:04:30]  You should sign it.  A listener would absolutely fucking take that.  There's no way that the monitor held the information, didn't it?  No.  You're a little paranoid.  Is that the monitor?  It's burned into the screen because you liked one particular clip.  I threw out some fucking...  My old BlackBerrys recently because I'm cleaning everything out.  And I'd say that.  I'm like, for what?  Like, my Storm's a piece of shit.  My old, old...  I can't save shit.  I threw him out.  You can't or you can't?  Oh, no.  I can't save shit at all.  You're so much better off, dude.  So much better.  The only thing I obsessively save is our radio stuff. 
[00:05:00]  That's interesting.  And press clippings and stuff like that.  But besides that...  No, no, no.  That's a good...  My mother's like that.  She can throw out fucking wedding photos.  She doesn't care.  Yeah, yeah.  Anything goes.  But you'll save yourself.  You know...  I really can't save shit.  And then, you know, living in Manhattan helps that along a little.  That's why I'm amazed.  But you got a storage unit.  I have two downstairs, yeah.  Because, again, it's...  Oh, wow.  And putting them in clear plastic things, I figure, because I might want to move soon.  Like, in the building or whatever.  But you save the monitor.  That's 10 years old.  But I didn't know. 
[00:05:30]  It wasn't when I put it down there.  It wasn't 10 years old when I put it down there.  But how many years ago did you put it down?  Four, maybe?  Maybe four or five.  So it was already six years old.  But I probably didn't buy this when it first came out.  Like, I might have bought this two years after it came out.  I probably had it for about four years.  But I don't make that much money where I just throw out computer stuff without thinking about it.  I think we need Matt Paxton here.  I really think Matt...  Clutter cleaners?  Yeah, clutter cleaners.  I showed my ex pictures of my apartment last night because I told her, like, I'm cleaning up. 
[00:06:00]  But it won't really help, though.  I don't know why I think this is going to be good radio.  I actually convinced myself that three pictures of my fucking boxes stacked is good radio.  And it's really not.  I love how you're...  Why is it yellow?  Because it's old.  Yeah, that is.  I've been sitting for a while.  Is that, like...  It's yellow.  It's a Belkin!  It's a Belkin!  I wouldn't fucking plug that in at this point.  See how it is?  I fucking, uh...  I put little labels on everything.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You got little labels.  You got those plastic storage... 
[00:06:30]  Look what I do, Opie.  We should get them a label maker for Christmas.  Oh, yeah.  No, my computer...  Label maker.  Oh, my...  I could never do that.  Like, my brain isn't wired like that.  I couldn't do that.  Can you label stuff in?  No.  And mark boxes?  I just found a bunch of old cards, too.  And they're all in boxes, but I put them now in these things, which are a little bit  better to care for them.  Right.  Old movie cards.  And I'm like, I got a fucking fortune on my hand.  Old Planet of the Apes.  Right.  From, like, 1975, uh...  Cards. 
[00:07:00]  Across the hall?  No!  Oh, okay.  And, uh, and...  What do you mean, like playing cards?  Yeah.  I mean, trading cards.  There's a callback.  Wow.  So, I'm, uh...  But I'm like...  Then, of course, I looked them up on eBay, and a couple of them are selling for, like,  500 bucks a piece, but I'm like...  Ooh.  You should start a side business.  People like you make a lot of money organizing other people's stuff, man.  I just take the box, and I put stuff in it, and then I write stuff on it.  Yeah.  And then, like, stack it up.  So, when you need to get to it, you're like, oh, there's stuff in here. 
[00:07:30]  And then years later, it's a surprise.  You're like, ooh, I wonder what's in this box.  Like, ooh, look.  Fucking...  Jimmy never gets to wonder.  Everything's labeled.  A zip drive.  You know what I found recently?  Jim and Jim do dice.  Did I ever play that on the show?  No.  Bring it in.  It's on a cassette.  Even if you did, it's been many years, I'm sure.  It's the night me and Florentine...  Did dice on stage?  We did dice at the comedy store.  It's like, fucking...  That was before I toured with...  Oh, the day you met him.  That was the day I met Andrew.  That was with Florentine in Los Angeles at the comedy store.  That was, uh...  I called him.  I was warming up for Louie Anderson at the show, and I'm like, dude, Dice is here. 
[00:08:00]  I called him on a pay phone, and Jim came down, and I went on after Dice and bombed,  and then me and Jim went up after hanging with Dice for an hour and did his act, and he's  in the back fucking howling.  You gotta bring it in.  But I had never...  Wow.  It was the first time I ever met him.  You've mentioned that time many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many,  many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many times.  Yeah.  Bring it in, man.  Was that the monitor?  Yes, it did.  Well, it's up on eBay.  All right, good news.  Cool, good.  The monitor is found with cables, with the cables, and this is a completed listing. 
[00:08:30]  Completed listing, so somebody bought it?  Oh, yes.  The winning bid, what's...  Oh, that's 19-inch.  How big is that?  That looks like about 19 inches.  That's more or less.  Is that 19?  It's ultra sharp, though.  That's right.  31 bucks.  31 dollars.  All right.  31 bucks.  So after fees, you're talking a good $20.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You saved something.  Three bids, by the way.  Yep.  Three bids.  I didn't save it for monetary value.  I just don't like to waste it. 
[00:09:00]  Look, I mean, look at this.  It goes, look.  Watch, you can turn it like the angles.  Boom.  Ah, that's great.  Boom.  Dude, you're wrangling your monitor.  Boom.  You know what's creepy about that whole thing?  It looks brand new.  On top of it.  Jimmy really does take care of your stuff.  You take care of your stuff.  Yeah, man.  I don't like to waste it.  All right.  What else we got?  Oh, please.  There's one of them that are on eBay right now.  Yeah.  It's not completed.  It's starting bid is $0.99, and so far it has zero bids.  Oh.  Wait, do we have an eBay account?  I want to sell this for $3,000. 
[00:09:30]  I'm telling you, if you sign that, you'll get a couple hundred bucks.  Easy.  Yeah, you sign it and put it up on eBay.  If I signed it, I would give it to somebody.  Just sign it on the screen.  Yeah, right across the front of the screen.  That's what I would do.  Because no one's going to use it as a monitor.  Jim Norton jerked off here.  It's got one of those cereal cables or whatever that is.  What's that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That little spiky cable.  It doesn't have USB.  USB was like, what?  Wait, doesn't it have USB?  That'll never catch on.  It does.  No.  No.  No.  It plugs into the computer, into the old school video card with the little, you know, 
[00:10:00]  and the two little screws.  See, this is a tough sell because you have to find someone that still has a computer that's  compatible with this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's ultra sharp, though.  15-pin cereal port.  Yes.  That's what it plugs into.  Thank you, sir.  Now, look at this.  Jim, I think.  Oh, man.  Whoa.  I think Norton's a hoarder.  I really do.  That's a subwoofer.  That's right.  Yeah.  Looks like a garbage can.  Treble.  That does look like a little waste paper basket. 
[00:10:30]  No, no.  Look how big that is.  The subwoofer.  Oh.  And these speakers.  Looks like a little microphone.  Hello.  Ooh.  Look at the sounds coming through my computer.  Ooh.  Crystal clear.  Those look very futuristic.  I was going to say, it looks like a futuristic phone.  Yeah.  That's futuristic right there.  That's good, right?  Yes.  And you know what?  It's just amazing, Jimmy.  That works.  That's fine.  I mean.  I have Bose now, but this is a Harman?  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  A Harman?  Great brand.  Is it?  What are we looking at as far as our interface goes on that thing?  Yeah, look at this.  Your standard.  No, it's standard interface.  I don't know what that means.  The water buffer gets your little eight-inch jack.  You want these?  Who wants to pick them?  Who needs them?  And then you've got your color-coded plugs.  Nobody wants my stuff.  Jimmy needs someone to want his stuff.  I've noticed that over the years.  You bring this stuff in just assuming that they're going to fight over it.  Indeed.  But no, I had a feeling that this one, I almost threw this down the, I almost said dumbwaiter 
[00:11:30]  or like banana, but I almost threw this out, but I'm just like, I don't know.  Nobody wants it.  That monitor is so worthless, I don't even have the desire to smash it.  Oh, no.  Do you understand that?  There has to be some worth when I smash something.  Well, the same problem persists with the speakers as it did with the desktop.  No, these are fancy.  Nobody has a desktop computer to plug it into.  Just bring these around with you.  You carry these in one bag and your computer and the other. 
[00:12:00]  You're in Starbucks.  Jimmy needs someone to want his stuff.  All right.  That's great.  That looks like a little robot.  Put it back in your box, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  He's sad.  That's sad.  Does anybody have a lot of things to plug in?  It's the Belkin.  You carry these huge boxes in a can.  Oh.  Yes, I did.  Poor Jimmy.  Carry the boxes here.  What's in the other box?  No one wants this.  That was this.  Oh, okay.  But I thought maybe somebody would want, I think because the guys in the back have monitors. 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, but I didn't realize how old, I didn't realize how fucking outdated.  Oh, boy.  Ten years is a lifetime.  I can't believe it.  That's a long time in the computer world.  Yeah, you need your USB.  I didn't know it was this fucking, I thought there was USB.  There's got to be USB.  That's a mistake.  No, I, uh.  Let's see the cables again for it.  No, see?  I can't be here.  Where?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Look, see that?  Wow.  And it's got it.  It's got the giant power supply and the.  There's not a single USB here.  There's really not.  Nope.  The 15 pin serial port.  Dell sucks.  Another stock I got into, by the way. 
[00:13:00]  Look at this.  That I failed.  Failed with.  Look at all these controls.  You can make it brighter.  Ooh.  Oh, the on the monitor buttons.  I love those.  It's an ultra sharp monitor.  It's a.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Crystal clear picture.  Crystal clear.  Jimmy's still trying to sell it.  Crystal clear.  You don't need the USB.  What are you doing?  You get your computer for USB.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fine.  We get a USB for this.  That's an awful, you know, it's very thin, but it's awful thick for these days.  Like the monitors now are very, very thin. 
[00:13:30]  This is an ultra sharp.  Yeah, yeah.  This is a popular model.  Let me ask you a basic.  Sure.  Let me ask you a basic question.  We all update our computer stuff, right?  Yes, we do.  And then when you have your old stuff, you usually try to find someone immediately.  Right, right, right.  Because the time is.  Time is of the essence.  Thank you.  Yes.  Time is of the essence.  It's getting old by the second.  Yes.  Why did you pack it up all nice and put it in a storage unit for five years and then pull  it out assuming that it's still worth something?  Well, I didn't know if it was worth money.  I would have just sort of given it away.  But you should have gave it to someone in your family.  I know.  I didn't think.  Or anyone. 
[00:14:00]  I didn't think.  It's like because I went to Mac and I probably didn't know I would stick with Mac and like, oh,  okay, I got a giant 30 inch monitor.  I want to get rid of my 30 inch Mac monitor and go down to the 27 because it's not tight.  Because mine is not.  The 30 they didn't make it in high gloss.  I like the high gloss better.  Now that you can give away.  Oh, yeah.  I can sell that.  It does sell for over a thousand.  As long as you don't pack it away for the next five years.  All right.  So should I put.  I'll just put this in the garbage.  All right.  There you go.  I'll leave that right there. 
[00:14:30]  He just threw it right over his head.  Do you understand?  Let's do the radio show.  Let me tell my mom to speak to staff.  We've got to walk the people through this.  You don't understand how this was packaged.  Bubble wrap.  Right.  Yeah, it fell.  He took two big boxes that would be a pain in the ass to carry in a cab.  Huge boxes.  Bubble wrap labeled.  Then the clear packing tape was over the seams.  It wasn't just folded clothes. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, my God.  And now he just tossed the monitor right over his head behind him and it smashed onto the floor.  Something he should have done five years ago.  It's not that I needed somebody to want it, but I feel like my process is complete now.  Like, I know for a fact that there's no use for it.  Nobody wants it.  There are a lot of guys here.  They can't all be wrong.  They're all computer smart.  I'm not going to use it.  So now it's like, it really is shit.  Get rid of it.  If Sam doesn't want something, then there's a problem.  It's bigger than the TV you have at home. 
[00:15:30]  Because Sam collects shit, too.  That's true.  But with the ports and stuff, you're right.  I didn't show that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So you probably have a storage unit filled with stuff that is useless.  I would assume this is the only thing down there that you don't need.  I have a lot of clothes, which I put in those space bags.  It's like, it's hard for me to get rid of clothes.  Oh, they vacuum out the air.  Yeah.  But they don't last for long.  Why do you save clothes?  A lot of them are concert shirts.  Oh, a lot you got to save.  That type of stuff I love.  I used to save clothes.  That, too, man.  Right down in the garbage chute.  I don't even put it in bags. 
[00:16:00]  I did recently.  The other day, I threw...  Fuck the homeless.  I just need it out of my house.  Dude, I think of the homeless.  I'm like, you know what?  People are freezing to death.  I'm throwing out sweatshirts.  Actually, we pile it in garbage bags and throw it in that church dumpster, whatever the fuck it's called.  Where can you do that?  It's a homeless.  I don't know where they've been.  Out of the suburbs.  They got these dumpsters behind the church.  They put all the fucking...  I call it a dumpster.  I don't know.  No, no.  I should do that, but I actually, with these, said fuck it and just throw them out because I always save them for too long.  I just got rid of them. 
[00:16:30]  I've been good.  I'm fucking fixing my dump storage units up.  Nobody's been interested either.  I've been trying to start this conversation for two weeks.  I was just telling people, yeah, my storage unit is looking good.  Nobody gives me shit.  I want to get the hoarder people.  The next time Dr....  What's her name?  Dr. Sazio.  Sazio comes in.  We should do a remote from your apartment.  But it's not as bad as...  Take a cab over there with her.  That would be great radio.  I'd love to enter my apartment.  No, because she'd be like, he hoards cum and he's leaving it on my back and my leg.  Because I think a lot of people get confused. 
[00:17:00]  They think hoarders are just messy.  But I think Jimmy may have a slight hoarding.  I'm not even going to say slight.  A hoarding issue.  Dude, I do.  But it's very neat.  But it's not...  Yeah.  Yeah, I fucking do.  But I also go through stuff and then get rid of it.  Like, the stuff I save, you look at most of it and go, oh, I see why you save that.  Like, my fucking signed stuff.  I bought these little bins.  I have, like, fucking 11 or 12 boxing gloves.  I put them...  I wrap them all nice and safely.  Then I put them in these bins and my...  It's like that type of shit.  See, being in radio, I had to move a lot. 
[00:17:30]  So, I became a minimalist.  And everything has to fit in a car for me.  Yeah, yeah.  To this day.  Obviously, I'm not moving anymore anytime soon.  But I still have that mentality that, okay, it's got to kind of fit in a car.  That's the criteria.  Yeah, absolutely.  In a car.  You remember when you pulled up to my place when we were moving together?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And how much stuff did I just smash in front of my house?  Because I'm like, all right, I guess you don't have room for this.  Yeah, a lot of electronics. 
[00:18:00]  I just started smashing.  Furniture.  It was just smashed in front of the house.  Because you took up the whole fucking truck.  I was told...  You and the ex of yours said, no, we'll share a truck.  I was told, dude, a couple of feet on the back of the truck's all I need.  A couple of feet on the back of the truck.  I had a house to move.  Oh, man, that sucked.  And I was like, I don't need these dumb coffee tables.  Fuck it.  Dude, I wish I was like that.  I fucking wish I was like that. 
[00:18:30]  Because it's not like usually shit you're ever going to need again.  That's how you prevent yourself from being cluttered.  That's what it is.  It's a battle in our house because I think my wife is more like you.  My parents were like that.  You need one who saves...  My father would save...  He'd save dumps in a fucking bucket if my mother would let him.  Really?  But my mother throws everything out.  So they kind of balance into their house.  Like as old people, they have the right amount of shit.  My mom threw everything away.  Oh, really?  Oh, my old report cards, all the stuff.  Oh, yeah, all that precious stuff.  That other moms would save. 
[00:19:00]  Irreplaceable.  Not my mom.  Seven kids, though.  That's a lot of shit to save, though.  Yeah, I'm not blaming her.  I'm just saying that's how she was.  I do have some stuff at home that I know I could throw away.  I don't know why I don't.  Electronic stuff is one thing.  And when I watch Hoarders, I do get mad when they say like...  They go, why don't you throw this away?  And they're like, well, I could take that apart and then I could put it with this piece.  And you're going like, you never...  I'm yelling at the TV going, you're never touching that thing. 
[00:19:30]  There's a woman, I swear, that was like a...  The computer was like a 486.  And it was gutted and wires are hanging out of it.  And they're like, why don't you throw that away?  She's like, well, the why is, what are you, a computer expert?  I could use that because I have the other thing there.  And she's holding up like floppy disks, drives and stuff.  And I'm yelling like, you're never going to touch that.  You're never going to put anything together.  You're just going to sit in your lump of shit pile of garbage.  And then I realized I got shit that I could throw away.  And you're talking to Jimmy right there. 
[00:20:00]  He has some of that stuff.  I can read the labels on a couple of these.  And some of these are smart.  Like when you look at that bottom bin, those little white boxes, those are all baseball card sets.  Give me the bottom pin.  So baseball cards are smart.  You collected baseball card sets too?  Oh, yeah.  Did we talk about this as ever?  Yeah.  That was our thing growing up, man.  We got every year from...  Oh, yeah.  From tops, right?  From the 70s all the way to late 90s.  No, I don't have that.  Every set.  I'm tired of it.  I have 79.  It's the only full set I have from the 70s.  Yeah.  The tops.  Alan Bannister was the last card I took. 
[00:20:30]  And my friend, Neil Grant, traded me.  Oh.  And I'm looking at this.  This is what one of the bins has in it.  Some of them have like old hard drives.  Old hard drives I saved.  Oh, boy.  Well, we know why.  But also, if you ever lose your shit, it's nice to be able to have.  Those I don't mind saving.  Those I don't feel crazy saving because you might want to get the information off them.  And there's nothing illegal on them.  But old hard drives, this is what the label says, Saddam Bush dolls.  I have these weird boxing dolls of George Bush Sr. and Saddam. 
[00:21:00]  But something tells me they'll be worth money.  And I love it.  Planet Hollywood Glass.  That's not going to be worth anything.  Osborne's Lunchbox.  Probably won't be worth a lot.  Yeah, but that's something that's, you know, you're about that.  My Vanity Fair article.  There's a few things in there that are actually smart.  And that's hilarious.  Planet Hollywood Glass.  Yeah, everyone gets one of those when they leave. 
[00:21:30]  Why are you saving that?  But these are more bins in my fucking.  Wait, why are you saving the Hollywood Glass?  I don't know.  It was just there.  So I just transferred it from one box to another.  I should have just fucking drank out of it.  Why don't you just throw it away?  Because I'm an asshole.  You're right.  Everyone gets one when they leave.  Yeah.  I didn't think of that.  But why is it valuable to you?  I don't know.  It's not now.  He said that.  Where were you yesterday?  I would have just thrown the fucking thing out.  Oh, but I was saying when I threw up my BlackBerry phones, I fucking filled my sink with water.  And I put them in the sink for 10 minutes with fucking full of water. 
[00:22:00]  Wow.  They'll dry out.  Yeah, yeah, they'll work.  Well, BlackBerrys are pretty amazing.  They come back.  Yeah, but when I threw them down the bin, I fucking, I fucking, I opened up the bin garbage thing.  And I pitched it really hard.  So it fucking smashed the wall and fell 10 stories.  So if anybody can get my fucking cockpits off that, you deserve them.  You deserve them.  What is that?  The Sedan Boxing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's it?  It's $2.99?  What year is that from?  No, mine's not yellow. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, no.  No, that's cheap.  Look for George Bush Sr.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, no.  Boxing.  There's nothing worse than when you open something and you're like, oh, gold!  And it's worth $3.50.  $3.  You know how much you're paying for storage bins and it's filled with junk?  It really is.  It's amazing that my fucking, the bins are worth more.  Yeah, yeah.  Than what I have in them.  George Bush Boxing Doll?  What do you want to know?  No idea what that is.  I've never hit a home run with collectibles. 
[00:23:00]  No, huh?  No, I don't think so.  Never.  No, no, no, no.  No, Sam.  They're like puppets.  You hold them.  You know what we should do?  We should bring some of the stuff in and have a garage sale.  Oh, man.  Just bring it all in.  We'll set it up in the hallways.  All of our junk?  We should do it for the listeners.  That would be hilarious.  They could come through us.  You could do it right outside on the sidewalk for the listeners.  A yard sale.  Why don't we have a yard sale and the listeners can come by and grab our...  Our junk.  Our useless shit.  You know how mad my building would be if I did that in front of my building?  Oh, man.  They wouldn't like that.  Yeah, let's bring them in now. 
[00:23:30]  Let's bring boxes of shit in and we'll set up a little yard sale.  We'll put someone out there trying to sell our wares.  Yeah.  And all the money can go to us and not charity.  Right.  That's cheap.  That's cheap, too.  Boy, you got...  What is yours?  Made up of sterling silver?  I found a big Aussie doll, which I'll never use.  Yeah.  What am I going to do with these...  You know, Aussie's all muscular.  It's like this tall.  It's like fucking...  Oh, really?  One of those action figures?  I have a few of those, too.  Ash from...  Yeah, the Evil Dead.  Yeah, Evil Dead movies. 
[00:24:00]  I keep thinking, if I ever get a house, if I'm in trouble, if I get a place,  it's like you're...  Oh, boy.  But there's so many places to have cool things.  Like, you have the room where you can have, like, little things set up where it doesn't  look cluttered.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  If you're bringing in monitors from 10 years ago, you got to have a lot more stuff that  is completely worthless.  I threw a lot of it out recently.  I got all my Dell RAM.  Dell RAM.  I'll never use that, right?  What am I going to do with it?  No, no, no, no.  Because RAM is different now.  Yeah, it's like...  First of all, there's a lot more of it.  Um, it's a lot cheaper. 
[00:24:30]  Am I going to use 256 things of RAM?  256...  I ordered extra ones.  ...things of RAM.  Whatever they were.  I ordered extra ones.  I ordered extra RAM for my Dell.  And, like, your hard drives that you're saving, you could get, like, a hard drive and put  them all on that.  I did.  Yeah?  Oh, you did.  I have multiple copies.  I'm afraid of losing my information.  I even have one in a bank vault with all my writing and stuff on it.  Jonathan taught me that, like, in my photos.  Like, a super villain?  I got so many photos and stuff.  That's more normal shit, though. 
[00:25:00]  I know.  See, I'm a smart guy.  Oh.  I don't want to lose my stuff.  The bank burns down.  I heard...  Did I tell you that John knew somebody who did this?  Like, I guess the bank pissed him off.  I don't know what the bank did.  But they had a fucking safe deposit box.  And they fucking were mad at the bank.  Actually, they put fish, dead fish, in their safe deposit box.  Oh, my God.  And then put it back in.  Wow.  And I guess that the whole fucking room was eventually going to reek like rotted fish. 
[00:25:30]  It's got to.  What's the rule, though?  Are they allowed to open up...  I don't know.  How do they know which one it is?  But they got to open it all up to find it.  Wow, that's true.  They have to.  What's the rule with that?  They have to.  I would love somebody to tell me the rule.  There must be something in the fine print.  If we smell the rotting fish, we're going to have to open up all the safe deposit boxes.  Yeah, no perishables, I'm sure.  Yeah, there are probably rules like that.  But what happens if there are?  Maybe you have to pay to have the smell cleaned out?  Oh, man.  Oh, I'm sure they'll go after you.  That would stink, yeah.  Oh, shit.  There's probably some kind of a law against the rule.  There has to be.  Maybe no one's ever done it. 
[00:26:00]  Maybe.  Well, you put the idea out there now.  I actually want to, if I want to rob the bank, I want to put myself in the fucking thing,  and then I'm going to open the thing from the inside and pop out and take all the money  and run.  Out of the safe deposit box?  Yes.  I'll be in the back.  I'll go in the safe deposit box and then close myself in.  Yeah.  And that means I'll be behind it where all the people's money is.  The boxes are hanging out.  Didn't someone do that once?  I don't know.  I saw a movie like that once.  I don't know.  Well, look at Jimmy's boxes. 
[00:26:30]  Bubble wrap.  Just amazing.  I just wish I could.  I fucking spent hours doing this stuff.  It's very thorough.  I have a lot of, oh yeah, see a lot of these are, okay, I took all my DVDs and I have them  in these like fucking.  What are those?  I know.  I've been throwing DVDs away lately.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  I saved the boxes.  No.  Oh boy.  Get rid of the boxes.  No, no.  Get like a book.  That's the big part.  Because I might want someone to sign it someday.  Well, well, you're a collector, so that's good.  I have the disc. 
[00:27:00]  No, but you can display the box is what he's saying.  The discs are in my, but then again, if somebody was coming in the series, I would just buy  the movie again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The boxes are in my fucking storage unit and the discs are in my apartment, but they're  in these like small, like you open a book with these little sleeves in it.  Yeah.  And there's four per page.  And that's how you fucking can store a tremendous amount of DVDs.  Oh, but you save the boxes in another location.  Yeah, which is a little crazy.  Separate from the discs.  But again, it's in a couple of bins who gives a shit.  But the couple of bins is adding up. 
[00:27:30]  It's just a couple of bins.  You're talking like every other hoarder out there.  Well, I also have all my CDs that were on my iPod.  CD?  Are not in my apartment anymore.  They're in bins in my storage unit downstairs.  Just get rid of the CDs.  You think so?  Yes.  You can get anything online.  There's no reason to have a CD.  I don't know why I have them.  And are you going to, at any point, try to transfer from a CD to a...  I did it already.  Yeah, yeah.  But I mean, now?  No.  Like, if you need to...  What if you lost those songs? 
[00:28:00]  I'd just probably buy them again.  Even with iTunes, like, Cloud Match, like, you can't lose those songs anymore.  Cloud stinks.  You can't lose them.  They've got them.  Not good for Cloud.  Cloud is going to be all the rage.  You don't like Cloud?  No, I don't believe in it.  Well, it's true.  Anti-Cloud?  I don't fuck with it at all.  It's too easy to get fucking in trouble with Cloud.  I'm just talking about songs.  Yeah, you do basic shit.  You do basic shit with Cloud.  You mean, like, the healthy intended use of it?  Yes, exactly.  Yeah.  Fuck, there's a lot of shit here that I should probably toss.  I start throwing my CDs away, my DVDs away. 
[00:28:30]  I have a select amount of DVDs.  I haven't.  I got...  Yeah.  I got probably five...  I probably got four or five hundred DVDs.  Oof.  And I don't even know the last time I went and grabbed a DVD and put it in.  There's no real...  Yeah.  I went from about 300 to...  I've got maybe 20 that aren't signed.  And then I've got a box of signed stuff.  Yeah, I've been throwing those away.  If anyone wants those before I totally get rid of them.  Signed or...  There's no reason.  Huh?  Not signed.  No.  I don't know.  Just living in a digital universe. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, but even signed.  Like, I was thinking a couple weeks ago, like, doesn't it sound silly to get, like, a VHS cover signed?  Like, how silly is it going to sound soon to get a DVD?  That would kind of be cool to have a VHS cover signed, though, of a movie.  That's something you can display, though.  Yeah, if it's signed, it's a whole different thing.  Yeah.  I have all my cassettes saved.  But those are going to go away soon.  My video cassettes.  What, signatures are going away?  No, no.  Don't worry about that.  But when DVDs go away...  No, but if it's a cool movie and it's signed by the people in it, that's still cool no matter what.  I have my original Lucky Louie scripts. 
[00:29:30]  All that stuff.  But that's normal.  Like that type of stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love to save.  But that's normal stuff.  You should save that.  I don't want to throw everything out.  But a 10-year Dell monitor is a little strange.  A 10-year Dell monitor.  As soon as you wrap it up and put it in storage, that's...  I don't know.  But I'm getting rid of stuff.  I am cleaning out.  As Eminem said, I'm cleaning out my closet.  So I feel good that I'm doing that.  Yeah.  Big boy cleans out his closet.  Yeah, big boy does that.  Big boy has a nice clean room.  That's good.  And now I have more room and I feel much better. 
[00:30:00]  But I'm not done yet.  There's something going on with Jimmy today.  No, I feel good.  I'm tired, but I'm okay.  No, there's something going on with you.  Really?  Does this bring up some weird shit in your head or something?  No, I'm just thinking, like, should I throw out my CDs and DVD boxes?  Yeah, there's a lot of thinking going on with Jimmy right now.  Look at his face.  Look at his face, Ed.  I know, no.  There's something going on.  But I understand what he's saying.  I think there's some kind of...  I got shit I got to throw out.  I know that.  But the fact that I threw out as much shit as I did is amazing.  And the clothes, a lot of them I'm attached to, but a lot of them I'm really not. 
[00:30:30]  I'm simply...  I feel weird wasting shit when there's people that don't have them that I feel weird about.  Yeah.  But that's easy.  Poor people.  You can put clothes in garbage bags and get rid of those immediately.  But the problem is, you know, where we live, me and Jimmy, I think most people know by  now, we live right next door to each other in different buildings, but right there.  We try to get rid of clothes in our neighborhood.  The fucking churches won't take them for some reason.  I'm guessing bed bugs and stuff, too.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what it was, but we went to a couple places right in our neighborhood, churches, 
[00:31:00]  and they're like, we don't take clothes.  I'm like, why wouldn't you take clothes?  You're supposed to help the needy.  Yeah, why don't they?  So then we had a...  I forgot exactly...  Oh, we had to wait and drive all the way out to Long Island to get rid of them.  Yeah, I fucking threw them out.  We got churches two blocks away.  Why wouldn't they take clothes?  Oh, they should take the clothes.  I'm guessing clothes.  I'm guessing it's for bed bugs.  They're all right.  Stuff like that.  You think?  Yeah, but bed bugs probably changed the game a little bit recently because in the last  couple of years.  Cruise wear.  What's that? 
[00:31:30]  Seinfeld.  I have a bunch of shoes I might get rid of, too.  Like, I have like 20 pairs of shoes that I don't wear.  Oh, my God.  But they're neat.  Because I have fucked up feet.  But some of them are cool.  I'm like, they're cool for stage.  Like, I like them.  And I liked them when I bought them.  But when was the last time?  What's the rule?  If you haven't...  Six months.  If you haven't worn something for six months, just throw it away?  Oh, yeah?  I have stuff from like two years that I keep saying.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, you know, I haven't worn this shirt.  Am I wearing it?  I know.  It's just...  When you lift up those clothes and go...  You're supposed to go, when was the last time I wore this?  And is it six months?  If they say...  If you haven't worn it in six months to a year, then they say throw it away. 
[00:32:00]  How about five years?  I have stuff from five years.  Like a time of Rudy's.  Do you have stuff you haven't worn in five years?  Oh, easily.  Yeah, that stuff you'll never wear again.  Jackets and stuff.  You'll never wear it again.  I know.  So if it's not worth anything to you, then you should just get rid of it.  You're waiting for the magical day.  Magical.  Like with Sam with this kid thing where you want to get rid of...  You want to use everything to a certain...  Yeah.  You know, it's hard to get rid of stuff like that.  But it's junk.  Most of the time, it's fucking junk.  Should I get rid of the CDs now?  But I have so many live concerts and stuff. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, keep those.  Like, I've got, you know, some rare CDs and, you know, some live stuff that I can't probably  find easily.  But it's already transferred.  Yeah, but it's already transferred.  But, you know, it's still cool to have the CD.  It's in bins.  How much room is it taking up?  It's a few bins.  Yeah, you're right.  It's just a few bins.  That's it.  How much room?  But it's not in my closet.  It's in a storage unit in clear plastic bins.  Storage unit.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  It's easy.  You throw on a thing and boom.  So I got my third storage unit.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  All my CDs and DVDs. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  You did what?  I have all of them.  You do.  Well, yeah, but you're not a good.  Okay.  I don't know.  Maybe I do. 
[00:33:30]  Keep talking.  Sorry.  I'm trying to think.  You are thinking.  But, Sam, you're a saver.  You save everything.  I also have all my old computer stuff.  And that comes from his mom saving his hair and little Boy Scout uniform and things like  that.  Total psychotic behavior.  Yeah.  The old monitors.  Sam was showing me all the Apple products that he still has.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  I have a G4 Cube.  A G4 Cube.  Yeah.  Do you remember it?  Oh, I remember the Cubes.  Yeah.  I have one of those.  I don't know why people think that computers, old computers are going to be collector's items. 
[00:34:00]  They're just not.  I have.  What are you doing with the Cube?  My parents, they actually want to throw out the old computers, but I don't want.  Why?  Throw it out.  No, not the Cube.  Why?  Because they don't make anything like the Cube anymore.  That's like a historical thing.  What's historical about?  Like, what do you think you're not going to be able to?  It's like a big deal.  Are you going to sell it?  And then it got discontinued.  I'm not going to sell it.  I just want to have it. 
[00:34:30]  And I have one of the Snow Globe iMacs.  Snow Globe iMacs.  One of these?  Oh, the one with the little round, half hemisphere.  It's a hemisphere base with the monitor that comes out.  It was supposed to look very futuristic.  Yeah, that's the computer I had when I went to college, and now I have it in my parents'  house in my old bedroom.  Yeah.  Just sitting there.  Sam's way worse than Jimmy.  Oh, God, yeah.  Way worse.  Irrational stuff.  I mean, I thought maybe someone would get used to it.  As soon as I realized nobody wanted it, I fucking broke it. 
[00:35:00]  I believe Jimmy thought that, you know, someone could use it.  And he's probably not as organized as Jimmy is.  Yeah, Jim wants to give his stuff away to somebody that can enjoy it.  Sam has no interest in ever taking any of this stuff anywhere else.  Yeah, I was just thinking about getting rid of my DVDs, but then I was like, I'm not  going to get rid of the wrestling.  What's your anxiety level now?  Is it at an eight?  Now, let's just pick one action figure, one WWE or F action figure, and throw it away,  and tell me how you feel about that. 
[00:35:30]  Horrible.  Oh, very bad.  Not going to do that.  But you know what's weird with the videocassette stuff that I've transferred to DVD?  And I have all my old sets, but I'm saving the DVDs, but I'm like, I'm saving the old  fucking...  That's totally fine.  But even though I have them transferred, even though I have them transferred, yeah, you  want a backup just in case.  Yeah, the personal stuff.  Yeah.  Because you can't find that anywhere.  Right.  I mean, if you have a...  It doesn't exist.  Someone bought me the Black Crow's Greatest Hits recently, you know, CD, and I'm like, 
[00:36:00]  all right, thank you.  I like the Black Crow's, but you could find that anywhere is my point.  Right.  You're not going to find the Jim Norton sets anywhere else.  I don't know why I said that.  That's why you should...  I should throw it away.  No, that's not...  No, you should...  No, no, no.  The CDs, I mean.  Oh, yeah.  Throw away the CDs.  You're crazy.  There's music you could literally find anywhere.  But I just keep having this fear that my iPod's going to fall apart and my computers are going  to be...  And all of a sudden, I'll have to go...  I don't have to buy...  Fuck, I have like a thousand CDs.  Yeah, but like I told you, if it's in the cloud, you're fine.  Yeah, but what if it's some CDs that I've bought before and uploaded and didn't buy? 
[00:36:30]  As long as it's in iTunes' library, they will cover it.  You pay 25 bucks a year and they'll match your library.  Well, that's too many live things.  I have too many live Ozzy and Sabbath things.  So then keep the live stuff.  I've got all my live Pearl Jam stuff.  If it's not taking up room, just keep it.  Who cares?  Ten bins.  That's only a few bins, though.  Yeah, that's only a few bins.  But just stack.  If you saw how I stacked them like a big boy.  Oh, yeah.  Stacked all nice and straight.  Perfect. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Right up to the ceiling.  Yeah, yeah.  Right up to the tippy top.  All my old fucking posters that are signed to...  I'm taking...  But that's all stuff that...  You should be selling.  That I don't mind.  But you shouldn't be...  You shouldn't be saving a 10-year-old Delmoner.  All right.  Maybe my Planet Hollywood glass I'll throw out.  He's thinking about it still.  I'll toss it.  This is the portion of the show where they're sitting out in front of their house, picking  and choosing.  Okay, I'll throw this away.  And then the poor junk guy's got to just take one glass, go into this giant dumpster and  put it in the corner of the dumpster. 
[00:37:30]  And it's like, well, only 80 more tons of shit to go.  Jim, how about this?  If you regret throwing away that Planet Hollywood glass, we'll send an intern three blocks down  and get you a new one.  Yeah.  When you put it like that, it really isn't a hard-to-get item.  But you have a tough time throwing stuff away.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  I've always been a collector.  Because I sold my Kiss stuff.  They call themselves collectors constantly.  That's so funny.  I am, though.  I don't say it's my little junk.  Of course, they aren't.  But you are. 
[00:38:00]  Yes, I realize how this sounds.  But when I was drinking, I sold my Kiss stuff.  And some of that's worth a lot of money.  Why'd you sell it?  To get liquor.  That's how desperate you were back then?  Yeah, I didn't have money.  But anyway, he had liquor.  I sold all my collectibles when I was drinking.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I would understand for the drugs.  Yeah, fuck you.  But alcohol seems to be something you could kind of find.  I was 16.  I had nothing.  Just stuff I'd had 10 years or 8 years.  Yeah.  I fucking, you know, Kiss Colorforms.  Like, weird shit like that. 
[00:38:30]  Kiss Colorforms?  They were collectibles, though.  Who was buying Kiss Colorforms back then?  Collectible shit.  Let's see how much that's worth now.  Or whatever.  Maybe we shouldn't.  That's the one thing that's worth a shitload of money.  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't.  The Kiss dolls.  If you have the Kiss dolls in boxes, those are worth fucking a lot of money.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  And you sold them?  I don't think.  I had all four.  I don't know if they were in boxes.  That's sealed, though.  How much is sealed?  $200, $219 bucks.  No, that's all right.  But for Colorforms, it's a lot of money for fucking color.  Shit, right?  But you could afford to buy the Colorforms back if you wanted to. 
[00:39:00]  I could probably buy everything I've ever sold back.  Absolutely, you could.  I didn't sell my...  Oh, my comic books.  I sold my comic books, too.  $150 bucks.  How much?  $60.  You can open it to $150 bucks.  I had a lot of comic books, and I fucking sold to drink fucking...  Yeah?  I had X-Men 94.  Look up X-Men 94.  Oh.  That was a good one.  That was the first new X-Men.  What's going on with you?  Nothing.  I'm actually just thinking of this stuff.  What's going on with you?  You're different today.  Did you have a good taping?  Yeah, I taped with Louis yesterday.  It was very good. 
[00:39:30]  I was done earlier than I thought.  I should have come in.  Yeah, it's fine.  I thought we were going to...  Last time we taped, we went until like fucking 8 o'clock at night.  Sometimes Louis goes really long, because there was a few of us, and I'm like, it could  go fucking for hours, or he's done in 10 minutes.  We did like five hours yesterday.  Damn.  How much is that?  That's $130, but if you had it graded...  Is that all?  It was worth more years ago.  If you had it graded, you could get like 700 bucks for it, if it's in good shape.  Okay, it can be up to that much.  I remember it was a couple hundred bucks. 
[00:40:00]  Jim Mint 10.  Yeah, you can't sell baseball cards or comic books online anymore unless they're graded.  We're selling the Jimmy Norton Collection.  The Jimmy Norton Collection, a 10-year-old Dell monitor.  You're not going to see one like this, people.  Put it on FlexPay.  Only $5.  Two payments of $5.  Are you implying my collection wouldn't get me out of hock or out of trouble?  Be hoarding, people. 
[00:40:30]  Be hoarding.  How about the new Teen Titans, number one?  I feel better that it's not that much money.  Yeah.  Man, 700 is a lot, but mine was not in great shape.  Mine was not.  No.  No.  You're lucky enough that you got money.  You could buy all the stuff that you sold.  Yeah, I am.  I don't want to get into comic books, though, because that's all I need is to start with  that shit.  A brand new, still-in-the-package Van Heusen sweater.  Van Heusen sweater, people.  Never worn. 
[00:41:00]  Let's not forget the clothes he brings in here, too, that no one wants.  Eric.  At the end of the year, last year, Eric gave us all CDs with photos from the last seven years.  That was very nice of Eric.  It was really nice, and it was depressing to go down memory lane just from how happy  we were years and years and years ago.  But one of the pictures was when everybody was wearing their Van Heusen shirts that Jim  brought in.  I remember that.  Yeah.  We did that last year, right?  Oh.  Yeah.  How many years ago?  I don't know. 
[00:41:30]  It was in the K-Roc studio.  Yeah, it was like four years ago.  Holy shit.  I know.  Eric does save pictures, which is nice.  It's great.  It was a lot of fun to look at all the old stuff.  My Andrew Lincoln picture, I can't find.  The fucking guy from Walking Dead.  Now I love that show.  Oh, man.  We're only in season two, right?  Yeah.  I'm not going to say any name, but is the last one where a certain really annoying person  fucking bought it?  Why?  Was there a spoiler alert?  I haven't.  I didn't see it yet, but Twitter spoiled it for me.  Yeah, I think so.  Have you seen it? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I've seen it.  Okay.  I'm so happy.  I hated him.  I fucking hated him.  I couldn't wait for him to fucking catch one.  How much is that worth, Sam?  Nothing.  40 bucks, and nobody's bid on it.  The new Teen Titans box.  See that?  Back then, when I was collecting actively, I think they were jacking up prices to make  these new things seem valuable.  They do have baseball cards, too.  No, they didn't.  They're all valuable.  Yeah, that was when people started really collecting, and the fucking cable was, people  were selling shit on cable and on the internet, and now it's not even the internet. 
[00:42:30]  Why are you collecting your shoes?  Because a lot of people want to know about that.  Because I've...  I'm fucking...  Do you have a lot of shoes, Sam?  No.  Do you know how many pairs of worn out black truck tailors I have?  Why?  How many?  I don't throw them out.  Oh, God, no.  That I don't know.  But I have, like...  Well, guess.  I must have a dozen pairs of, like, worn out black truck tailors, because it's the only  shoes I wear.  But why are you saving them? 
[00:43:00]  Obviously, when you bought a new one, that means you were done with the old ones.  Yeah, I don't wear them again.  Isn't it weird that you're...  Why do you say that?  You're afraid of wanting something, and it not being there.  That is the...  Yeah.  It's the fear of the hoarder mentality.  Of wanting it, and it being gone, and too late to recapture it.  But yet, you never...  The sneakers I saved, too.  And I have a pair of green ones that were ruined in the fucking...  In, like, a flood or new...  I'm like, why...  What?  I'm throwing them out.  And the other ones are brand new, though.  Like, I've worn them once or twice, and they started hurting my feet. 
[00:43:30]  And I don't know why I think they won't hurt my feet anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  Get rid of them.  I have a pair just like that.  And they're new, and they're nice, man.  And for stage, they'll be great.  Where are your used sneakers?  They're all...  I put...  Imagine the smell of that closet floor.  Oh, man.  When I get the new pair, I put the old pair in the box, and just put it somewhere on the shelf.  Why?  His mommy probably uses them as, like, potpourri.  She hangs them in the car as...  Planters.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's about what...  It's about Jimmy today, but Sam is way worse. 
[00:44:00]  That's weird.  Yeah, that one is weird.  That's bizarre.  You're never going to need...  But what is your logic?  I don't have any.  That one's just a weird one.  I don't have any.  Do you think someone's going to steal your shoes on the way home, and then you're going  to need another pair?  And his glasses.  Could you go home right now and throw them away?  Right now.  No, I mean, if there's a real...  Then stay home.  And please stay home.  If there's a real reason to do it.  And realize this was your last day.  There's a real reason.  You don't need them.  You're an asshole.  That's the real reason.  No, that's not a real...  You couldn't go home right now and throw them away knowing they're completely useless.  Not unless I needed the space for something, or there was something going... 
[00:44:30]  No, there would have to be a specific reason.  How about thinking of...  Now that you're getting married, you got a chick that's going to have to have her stuff, too.  She couldn't like that.  I mean, I can sell it in my closet.  It's not like it's in her space.  Oh, it's just in the closet.  That's okay.  It's not in her space.  It's just in the corner of the bedroom.  I just throw it in some bins.  Until it reaches a point where something else could be in the closet, but it can't fit because  there's other things in the closet, and then that's got it.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a weird one.  There's a lot of weird ones with you.  I guess so.  But at least you're willing to admit that one. 
[00:45:00]  That one's a weird one.  That is weird.  Because they're worthless.  Yeah, they're totally worthless.  They're worn out.  Chuck Taylor's.  Do you think there's going to be high demand for used Chuck Taylor?  No, I mean, you can get them for $40 new.  Why would you want them worn out?  Would it be worn by Sam Roberts?  The soles are all worn out.  There's holes in them.  Does your mom sell them all online?  Oh, my God.  You should.  Sam Roberts old shoes.  Yeah.  Does your mom collect besides the stuff we've talked about on the show?  Does my mom collect?  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  Like her own shit?  No.  I mean, she has a bunch of stuff from when the kids were young, but she doesn't have one.  Well, that's basic mom stuff, except for the hair, obviously, that we all freaked out about.  Yeah.  It's a weird need.  Like, I wonder, what does it go back to, too?  Like, this need to be able to touch things or save things.  Like, what is it?  Is it like, you know, there's that stupid chick that I liked when I was a kid who moved away,  and I was supposed to go say goodbye to her, and I didn't.  And I left my clothes piled up, and I just couldn't do it.  I couldn't leave the apartment.  My mother's like, go say goodbye, and I just never saw her again. 
[00:46:00]  So I'm like, is that, is something like that, does that make you want to save and recapture everything?  So you never have that again?  Like, does something spawn that shit?  I don't know.  It's in all of us.  Is it in you?  It's in all of us.  Different levels, but I think we all have it.  Yeah.  And it's, but computer stuff seems smart until you realize, like, this is a good example  of how fast technology changes.  It's got to be the dumbest thing you could save is anything computer-related or technology-related,  because it's just, first of all, it's not going to be worth anything like a collector's item. 
[00:46:30]  Like an original Mac or Apple.  And then it's just going to be old and unusable.  So just throw it the fuck away.  And as I'm talking, my office has so much shit piled up in it.  I have a couple of bins myself of wires and various computer parts and, like I said, video  cards.  That closet in my office, packed with DVDs on shelves, not because I'm saving them.  And this, again, sounds like a hoarder. 
[00:47:00]  But I just never went to it to throw it out.  I'd love to throw them away.  I could give a shit.  I noticed when we were over for the Super Bowl, Danny and I went into your office to print  something out.  And it was getting a little cluttered.  It's getting a little cluttery in there, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we had to escort Warren and Riley out because of the giant gun that was on the  floor.  Yes, the .50 caliber was on the floor.  I finally put that back up in the vault.  I go the other way.  I've said it on the air.  Like, after my wedding, I literally threw away wedding gifts.  You're dead? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, because it was stuff I would never use.  Oh.  Probably.  So I was throwing away wedding gifts.  Yeah.  Like, when they give you bowls and just this and that type of crap, it goes in a cupboard  or a shelf for a little while.  And I'm like, I'm never going to use this thing.  And no one really wants it.  What, am I going to have a real yard sale?  Yeah.  So I put it in a big garbage bag and throw it down the chute.  Stuff people bought me for a wedding.  What happened to that horrible oil painting that you said someone gave you? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  You were going to show us.  It's still, that, for some reason, I can't throw away.  That's a rough one, because if they ever ask you about it, it's gone.  This guy fucked me by giving me that thing.  That's a rough one.  Because his brother fucking painted it.  He's from Philly.  I guess he's known for his paintings and, I don't know, the art community down there.  And I'm like, fuck.  Do you like it?  No, I hate it.  I fucking hate it.  I always hated it.  What did you say in your first opening?  You're like, oh.  I'm like, I will never hang this thing.  It's nice. 
[00:48:30]  But it's a winter scene with a fucking brook.  What am I going to do with this thing?  Why don't you sell it and give the money to charity?  Or do the yard sale.  Bring it to the yard sale.  I'm going to see the guy.  He's like, how's that painting?  He doesn't say that, does he?  Oh, yeah, he does.  It's all about the painting.  He thinks he gave me the most amazing.  He must not be a radio show fan.  No.  I think he is, too.  That's the weird part.  We don't bring it up enough, I guess.  Oh, okay.  He hates your painting.  I fucking hate it.  We really should.  I fucking hate it.  We really should do some kind of a yard sale.  We should do it in Cleveland. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, man.  You know, I was actually thinking of that.  Yeah, but then getting that shit to fucking Cleveland.  You have it shipped on in a fucking truck.  Yeah, let's just pay one of these guys to take the drive.  Fuck it.  How much?  With our shit.  I don't know.  We might be able to come up with something.  A new bin for your sneakers.  Dude, you keep your job.  We're on stage and we bring out our shit.  I'll bring out the painting.  That's the one thing I still have because I don't know what to do with it.  I got an old friend that is more than willing to display it in Huntington.  At his house. 
[00:49:30]  I know what you could do with it.  I know what you could do with it is fucking...  I didn't think you would have to do this for charity,  but you can bid on the right to urinate or defecate on the painting.  I would do it in a second.  At this point, I don't care if I hurt the guy's feelings  because I'm like, you put me in a bad spot.  I would never hang this up in my place.  Yeah, that's actually...  My hand is resting on my penis right now and it's getting hard.  Oh.  What, your hand? 
[00:50:00]  It's atrophied.  Dude, I actually thought of Cleveland.  That's a good idea.  It's something...  I can find some other shit.  I just got rid of so much stuff, though.  Bring that stuff.  I already broke it.  What, that shit?  The Harmon speakers are...  They're not good.  He's ready to go.  They're great.  They're...  I just...  They're terrible.  It's the monitor you broke on the show.  There are fans that will buy it.  Sure.  Bring your dolls from, you know...  Dwight Saddam doll.  Yeah, that's where the fucking first Gulf War...  You know what?  Bring your Planet Hollywood glass.  Yeah, yeah.  The Planet Hollywood glass is famous now. 
[00:50:30]  Now it's famous.  Bring your CDs.  Yeah.  People can drink out of it.  I just got lazy.  I'll just tweet the picture of the painting finally.  I was fucking around with that for a while, but...  Just so people could see that it is a nice painting, but I don't...  Dude, you gotta bring it...  And we live in New York.  It's all windows.  I don't even have a wall.  Bring it to fucking Cleveland and tell somebody to do...  Maybe somebody will actually love it and want it.  I mean, this way at least you know it's going to a good place.  People would absolutely like it, but it's assuming a lot that this is the type of taste you have.  I hate when people do that. 
[00:51:00]  Or you could have some kind of...  Give me a gift card.  How about we could put the painting up on the stage and people could...  Run through it?  Or somebody could fucking pay for the right to throw a baseball through it or a fucking bowling ball.  Yeah, yeah.  To really smash it.  Yeah.  I'll bring it on the plane, I guess.  Is it too big?  It's big.  We should have somebody just drive this stuff out there.  Yeah, maybe.  We've got to ship other stuff.  Yeah.  With that...  Oh.  I said ship.  Oh, oh.  How about a 15-pin Sidewinder, Microsoft Sidewinder joystick that used to shake, did the shaky thing. 
[00:51:30]  But I played on it, so it's famous.  Is that no good, right?  Oh, my God.  It's so old.  All the fucking booze that's been spilled on it.  Oh, I know.  Please.  The tears and fears that have fallen into that.  The fucking first three quarters of it smells like your asshole.  All right.  Well, we should break, I guess, and start the radio show.  I always think Cleveland's further away than it is. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  It's pretty close.  It's an hour flight here.  Right there.  Pennsylvania's in the way.  Right outside Buffalo.  Stupid Jersey.  I can't wait to get out there.  It'll be fun.  I bonded with Kenny when we drove from Cleveland to Buffalo.  Oh, man.  And he was driving my car, and he just started talking about the old days, and he was just  staring out into the highway, telling me these horrific cop stories.  And I was, for a moment or two, I was scared he was going to drive into oncoming traffic. 
[00:52:30]  I was convinced of it.  And then there was the time, you know, in his monotone voice.  Oh, my God.  It's a good ride, though, Cleveland to Buffalo.  I remember that.  Didn't we all just take our vehicles or something?  Yeah, I think so.  It was like the first week I had it.  You drove all the way to Cleveland?  Yeah.  Well, we were on tour, I think.  Where were we before Cleveland?  We did Philly, Cleveland, Boston.  We did Buffalo.  Where else?  Was it just in Philly, Cleveland, New York, Buffalo, Boston, I think. 
[00:53:00]  Did we do D.C., maybe?  Might have.  All right.  Well, we should break.  We got to talk about Peyton Manning.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did he do?  Oh, I think he took a trip.  What?  Didn't he take a trip?  No, something's going on with Jimmy.  I'm not going to let this go.  Really?  Didn't he take a trip to Florida?  I read that Peyton Manning went to Florida.  That's correct.  Oh, okay. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, he's going to sign with the Dolphins.  Oh, okay, yeah.  I was right.  I saw that two days ago.  That's a bet you should have taken.  Is that why you've been hanging around?  I'm just, you know.  We'll discuss the bet after the break.  Yeah, you could buy that monitor with your extra cash.  That's true.  People are very excited that I might have lost another bet.  Might have.  Might have, yeah.  The second I heard that they made their announcement, I was skimming through the news to see if the iPad was the same size.  We might be on the radio right now.  What was the bet? 
[00:54:00]  Well, we'll discuss it next.  I might have lost some money.  Yeah, maybe.  I suck at betting.  Possibly.  Well, I'm going to argue it a little bit.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  You'll have your day in court.  I might need some tape from yesterday.  He's going to appeal.  Take all the tape you want.  Appeal the bet.  I want to see if Travis said if it stayed the same or not.  Oh, man.  He's going to try to find a loophole.  I'm going to try, man.  I have to.  People are very excited I lost more money.  I'll testify for you, Travis. 
[00:54:30]  Fuck.  No one's going to be on my side.  All right.  Yeah, let's go to break here.  This is the OPA Anthony Channel.  Serious XM.  Welcome back to Cock Talk.  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, we're talking about your first man-on-man experience.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico. 
[00:55:00]  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man as of yesterday.  I am a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mars, I see here you had your first gay experience last night.  Yeah.  Yummy.  So tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I'm anal retentive.  It's so tight.  Mm, sexy. 
[00:55:30]  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction, and then  he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God, about two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second, and all of a sudden, this motherfucker, all the way in 
[00:56:00]  my ass.  Oh, boy.  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like, he goes like this, come on, buddy, help me, help me here, work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly.  Come on, alcohol.  How do you do it?  Alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Murder, did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards. 
[00:56:30]  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  What is it, toss salad?  You could toss my salad anytime.  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars, you are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you.  This is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars. 
[00:57:00]  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh, you little Spanish fly.  You've got me all wet.  See you next week for more Cock Talk.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Talk about it, shout about it, when you've got to choose. 
[00:57:30]  Any way you look at what you lose.  Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?  Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you.  Ooh, what's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?  Get in topical.  Hold up, wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, Sexy.  Good morning. 
[00:58:00]  How was your fake sick day yesterday?  Oh, no, it was a real sick day.  No one's sick for one day.  Did you see him look at his muscles?  Huh?  Did you see him look at his throat?  What, today?  No, no, no, the other day.  No, the other day.  Didn't you see him do that?  Of course I did.  Why would a healthy person do that?  Yeah.  Yeah, you were setting up a fake sick day.  Why don't you admit it?  No.  I thought I had strap coming.  But you're fine today?  I don't have strap.  So I came back.  Then there was the, oh, the strap.  So is your throat still sore? 
[00:58:30]  It's still sore, but there's none of that white spotted shit all over it.  Did you get checked for, did you get checked for a strap?  No.  So how do you know you don't have strap?  Because I don't have the, I've had strap before and I know where it leads to and what  you get and I don't have it now.  I don't have that white stuff.  How do you know you don't have strap if you didn't go to the doctor and they have to scrape?  Yeah.  Doctors don't go and look at your throat and go, oh, you have strap.  Yeah, they do.  They've never heard doctors say, you know, the white stuff.  They have to get a culture and they don't, they pretty much make you gag because they 
[00:59:00]  go in the back of your fucking mouth.  They give you the culture when they see all that white shit on the back of your throat and  on your tonsils.  Oh boy.  But then at that point you have strep.  So why would they even have to fucking do the culture?  Good question.  I just get mad because he takes fake sick days like anyone else around here, but he's  the only one that doesn't admit it.  Yeah.  Why don't you admit you had to take a fake sick day?  My throat has been killing me since Sunday.  When he came in, he did, when he came in, the first thing he did was like, hey, good  morning.  How are you doing?  He put on the voice.  It was pretty good. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  He had a sick voice.  He had a sick voice when he said, how are you doing?  He's like, good morning.  But see, when I, I don't know.  Do you have sick breath?  No, I don't have like flu breath or anything, no.  But you're only sick for a day?  Yeah.  That's weird.  That is weird.  Because when we go down with real sickness, it usually is two, three days.  Okay.  How many times have you fucking told me, oh, if you're sick, why don't you  why are you even coming in?  And then when I don't come in, why the heck didn't you come in?  We don't want to get sick.  So you're proving my point. 
[01:00:00]  If you took a sick day yesterday, that means you're still sick and we would get sick.  I still have a sore throat, but I don't have strep.  How do you know?  How do you know you don't have something like a cold coming on, something that I can actually  swallow better than I was doing?  With a sore throat, that's something probably the rest of us could get, going back to my  point.  But my point is we all think you took a fake sick day again.  I wasn't even hearing that.  I didn't know you did.  So it's just a sore throat.  Yeah.  So why couldn't you come in with just a sore throat? 
[01:00:30]  And if I came in and said, look, this is really bad.  And then you would scream, why?  Get away from me.  You pulled your shirt over your nose and mouth.  But you knew it wasn't anyway.  Yeah.  The day you were looking at your throat when I was in the bathroom, that means you should  have taken that day off.  Because obviously you knew there was something going on.  Yeah.  I was seeing if it was getting any worse and there was nothing back there.  So obviously it got worse yesterday because you took yesterday off.  No, I don't think so.  Sam, what do you think?  This timeline isn't working.  Don't make me bring Troy in here. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, boy.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Oh, man.  Get Troy.  Get Troy.  Get Troy.  Someone healthy.  Drink grass drink.  Drink grass drink.  Drink grass drink.  Drink grass drink.  It's called grazing.  Why am I the only one here when any of you guys take off or whatever?  We just said it.  No one calls you.  Because we-  No one says anything.  But the second I do it, oh, there's a huge fucking problem.  E-Rod, because we just told you and everyone else admits that they're taking the sick day  because they're just burning sick days.  You call me on vacation, too. 
[01:01:30]  Because they're just burning sick days.  When you know damn well I'm going to be gone.  You want to make sure you're okay.  You're on vacation right now.  I'll listen to the voice.  Yeah.  Don't yell too much.  I don't want that voice to-  Fucked up.  I take days off to go work or to shoot like yesterday.  Yeah, but no one calls you knowing damn well that you left because I'm working.  That is the fakest fucking voice.  Nah, but they can't because they know that I'm working.  No, let me tell you something.  Listen, Joan.  I haven't been sick.  I haven't taken a sick day in years.  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy comes in here with the flow and all sorts of shit.  Troy. 
[01:02:00]  He's always sick.  He is sick.  There's always an issue with him.  Oh, yep.  Isn't it?  It's just always something.  When was the last time I was sick?  Oh, if it's not your fucking throat, it's your guts, your shitting everywhere, you have  to run down to the bathroom, you have a headache, you got to leave early.  It's always something.  My point is simple.  You took a sick day yesterday, but you're not sick today?  No, I still am.  I just don't have stress.  So that means you're going to get us sick.  So why would you take another day if you're sick?  Because God forbid I took two days. 
[01:02:30]  We wouldn't even notice.  Oh, bullshit.  What are you saving up for?  I turned my phone on yesterday.  Oh, look, there's eight calls throughout the show trying to get me on the phone.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that part of it's fun.  It would almost be a little more believable if you took today off.  Right.  That's exactly what we're saying.  Next time, take two fake sick days.  You think he was faking?  And then no one will question it.  Of course I think he was faking.  You think he was definitely faking?  Yeah, he wants to set up his place.  Ah.  Castelnagel.  He disordered some new furniture, too, didn't you? 
[01:03:00]  No.  Exercise equipment, you're thinking.  Eric, why'd you take off yesterday?  Because then it makes it more interesting.  Troy, you don't think he's sick?  What's the real reason?  I don't care.  No, he's not sick.  No, he's not sick.  No, he's not sick.  Wasn't there also video game rumors?  Mass Effect 3.  That he's playing Mass Effect 3?  No.  People are guaranteeing that's why he took the video off.  Well, Travis said that his video game skill was not on the level of Mass Effect 3.  Oh, okay.  I don't know anything about video games.  That makes sense.  Sam, do you think he's really sick?  No.  No, I don't.  Maybe a scratchy throat that he's taken advantage of? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I mean, we've all had scratchy throats.  We have weird sleep schedules and everything that happens.  But I think he's fine.  I think yesterday...  And he says he turned on his phone and had eight messages because he was needed.  No, he wanted to make funny on the radio.  No, I wasn't needed.  That's not what I said.  I said I turned on my phone.  I had all these missed calls.  Oh, the voices sound a little better.  And voice bells from Paul.  It sure is, isn't it?  It's getting better.  You're getting better.  Yeah, good.  So, Troy, you think you wish you something I want to kiss?  You want to see what you do tomorrow?  He's so mad.  He always has something wrong.  There's always an issue with him. 
[01:04:00]  And you always got to come in here and say, I need to comment about Eric.  Did I?  You don't comment about anybody else but me.  We asked him to come in.  Who called me in here?  I was sitting back there doing Joe Rogan promos.  I don't know.  I wasn't here yesterday.  Wait, not Opie.  Just called him just now.  No, I got things on Twitter.  Then why are you still friends with Troy?  He's a douchebag.  He's talking shit about you.  He's not.  Oh, the voice.  First of all.  The voice went right there.  I heard it.  It went out.  If Opie asked me to come in here, I have to come in here.  And then if he asked me a question, I'm going to answer it honestly.  But I don't come in here just be like, oh, let me just talk shit about Eric.  Yeah.  But if Opie calls me in here, I have to give him my opinion. 
[01:04:30]  My point is if you're sick enough to call out, that means you're going to be gone for a little bit.  All right.  Right, though?  Unless it's a 24-hour bug, which doesn't happen with a sore throat.  No, it wasn't a flu or anything.  Well, then.  Oh, I know, but I'm just saying.  A sore throat is the one thing you can absolutely come into work with if you know it's not strep.  Right.  Which you said you knew it wasn't strep.  Do you now feel like you could have been here yesterday?  Oh, probably.  Fake sick day. 
[01:05:00]  Fake sick day.  Fake sick day.  Fake sick day.  Did you go to a Conan taping?  Huh.  Funny.  What was the big event yesterday?  Or was it wrestling the night before?  You were.  Look, the only thing is you were live tweeting Monday Night Raw very actively.  Monday.  And then on Tuesday you were like, oh, I'm not feeling well.  And that led to the sick day.  Do you think that he tuckered himself out tweeting and eating and watching wrestling?  All excited.  Yeah.  Yelling at the screen.  Maybe you were yelling at the screen and that's why you're throwing her.  Pin him.  Oh, put the leg move on him. 
[01:05:30]  Did he get excited about the matches?  Were you eating Tostitos?  It was an exciting raw.  And scratched your throat with a Tostito.  Yeah.  That happened.  Were you yelling and sucked out a Tostito too quickly?  And he does like Tostitos.  Of course he does.  He's fucking amazing.  Troy, are you confused by this whole thing?  No.  It's just, you know.  You know how it is, dude.  Yeah.  It's just one thing after another.  And he's just not, he's never honest with himself.  He's never honest with anybody else.  Thanks, mom.  Oh.  Ask, Eric, ask anybody that works with you. 
[01:06:00]  Ask anybody that works.  No, ask you.  Can you fucking detail everything I do?  Ask anybody that works on this show, do you think Eric is honest with himself and see  what they say?  And this affects you how?  Because I was asked to come in here and comment.  So I'm commenting.  Just answering.  Why him?  Well, answer that question.  How does it affect you?  How does it affect me?  Because you have an answer for everything.  It annoys you a little bit, God.  It annoys you, why?  Well, because you have to work with the guy.  I mean, I try to be as minimal with my, you know, interaction as I can with him, but at  some point I have to interact with him and it's always an excuse about something. 
[01:06:30]  A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  Its weakest link, of course.  Is there a chink in the armor around here?  Oh, boy.  You can't say that.  Why?  People get fired.  Racist.  Oh.  Saying things like that.  Very racist.  You know who the chink in the armor is, by the way?  Who?  Carmelo Anthony.  Ooh.  Saying it right the fuck now.  No one's talking about lead sanity, are they, right now?  Who?  Everybody's talking about E-Rock.  Yes.  E-Rock sanity.  Yes.  So now, E-Rock, Troy is saying that you always have a malady. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, that's it.  Like, you think he complains a lot?  That's amazing, because I complain all the time.  Well, it's always something.  I'm gone all the time.  It's always a headache.  It's your fucked up bowels.  It's sore throat.  No one talks to you about this.  No, but I'm just, this is my observation.  And why wouldn't you take your fake sick day on a Monday or a Friday to have a nice long  weekend?  Exactly.  You don't even do fake sick days properly.  Because he got new furniture.  He wanted to put it together.  Oh.  You had to wait for delivery, you think?  So why wouldn't you tell people, I have to wait for delivery?  I'm going to take a personal day. 
[01:07:30]  Because he's not honest with himself.  And he's not honest with the people that he works with.  Oh, is it the slick thing that you were talking about yesterday?  Do you think he's slick?  You get caught.  Well, he thinks he's slick.  You don't think he's slick?  No.  Fuck no.  Oh, boy.  He's just, he's not an honest person.  He's not honest with himself or anybody else.  He seems pretty honest.  So that's why it's just fun to call him out on bullshit.  You know what I mean?  Like, if he was just, if he was honest with me, he's like, dude, listen, I got some furniture.  I had a delivery.  My wife couldn't be there.  I had to take care of it.  He was studying his throat a lot on Tuesday. 
[01:08:00]  A lot of us saw him.  Well, that's because he was setting it up.  I know.  That's why I brought this whole thing up.  Because that's exactly what I felt.  That you were setting up a fake sick day, E-Rod.  Is that the slickness you were talking about?  Yeah.  Eric, comment.  Don't leave me for this conversation.  Keep up making your own stories.  Oh, well.  You don't need me here.  Well, what do you want to add to it?  We like breaking you down, and then when you admit you took a fake sick day, it makes  for great radio.  So why were you really home yesterday?  I fucking told you already.  Oh!  Not that F word. 
[01:08:30]  So, um.  He gets rambunctious.  Troy thinks he's been called on the carpet.  I guess his throat got a lot better one day.  It did.  You hear it now?  It's fucking powerful.  But how come Troy is saying that you're not honest with yourself or with other people?  Because Troy likes to stir shit, and he's just got something out on me.  How are you guys even friends?  I don't know.  What's he got out on me?  I have no idea.  You mean, as we call him, no sick day Troy?  No sick day Troy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We call him that.  He's DJing.  He's fucking all night, and then he comes in.  This kid goes days without sleeping, and I don't miss you a day.  When was the last time you missed a day, Troy? 
[01:09:00]  And everyone's allowed to miss days, of course.  I think I took one in January.  But the dishonesty of it is why we bring it to the table.  Yeah.  Well, fuck you and your dishonesty.  Oh, E-Rod took something, so that's what the bit's going to be, and that's what we have  to call out.  When anyone else has gone here for any other reason, nobody calls them.  Nobody checks up on them.  Nobody talks to them the next day about why they weren't here.  Troy, you want to take this one?  Nobody gets this shit but me.  Troy, you want to feel this one?  Well, I mean, it's just funny to see your reaction, first of all. 
[01:09:30]  But I think it, isn't it also the dishonesty?  Like, when I was on jury duty, if you had called me and said-  Yeah, no one called Sam for jury duty.  Yeah, but that's because-  But if I was there, you'd be calling me every 15 minutes.  Because we knew Sam was at jury duty.  We would have said, Sam, where are you?  And I would have said, jury duty.  Yeah, I told you.  For some reason, people don't believe you.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  But we had no doubt that Sam was at jury duty.  Maybe because you've never taken an authentic sick day.  That's true.  Do you think-  I'm going to ask, I don't know what the answer to this is, but do you think-  Does it annoy you that you think he's pampered and just needed an extra day to do his things? 
[01:10:00]  He likes to have his pampering time?  Yeah.  Well, of course.  He's just-  He got a new house.  He's excited to put his shit together and get situated in it.  And instead of just being honest with the people he works with, he's just-  It's just bullshit.  And then you just see these little things that he's trying to do to cover up for it or-  Jealousy on you reeks.  Whoa!  No Manchin Troy is jealous.  Oh, Eric's not here, so let's make up the story.  The pot roast on you reeks.  This seems to make sense, so this has got to be what it does.  I don't care what his answer is.  I'm just going to say this, and that's the gospel of Troy.  Oh, shit. 
[01:10:30]  Look at this.  The gospel of Troy.  I'm not allowed to give my opinion on things?  Not with name on Twitter writes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest sausage link.  Come on.  Get it?  Because it's a fat joke.  I eat.  Oh, god damn.  I knew someone would come up with that.  And someone else wrote, chink in the armor.  No, it's more like chunk in the armor.  That's just mean-spirited.  People are so brutal.  Poor Iraq.  That's why we bring this up.  Let's throw it as short.  It's fodder.  So, Travis, you think Iraq was really sick yesterday?  No. 
[01:11:00]  See, no one believes you, Iraq.  It's not just me.  Good for you.  Why doesn't anyone believe you?  Let's get into this.  Why?  Let's see.  How many years have you been doing this as a bit?  It's not a bit.  Anytime I'm not here, it becomes a bit.  Sam, what do you think?  I think it's suspicious that I've heard he asked about what guests were coming in on Tuesday.  And then we didn't have any guests coming in.  Right.  And then he took the second.  Because he wants to be here for guests. 
[01:11:30]  On Tuesday.  To get stuff signed.  Right.  No, you asked on Tuesday, do we have any guests coming in tomorrow?  Why'd you ask that?  Who did I ask that?  What?  Who'd you ask a guest's question to?  That's true.  That's what I just asked.  Sam, who would you be?  What?  Sam brought it up.  Where are you getting your info?  The Road Dog, Roland.  The Road Dog.  He's called the Road Dog now?  Road Dog.  Oh, the Road Dog, Roland.  I've been calling him Road Dog for some time now.  I like Road Dog.  Road Dog.  Nice. 
[01:12:00]  Is Roland here yet?  I don't know.  Fuck.  He wasn't.  And he didn't tell me that to be malicious.  But that's just what I heard.  Yeah.  I guess it's been a bit for many years.  But I don't even remember where this began.  There must have been a suspicion way back in the day.  And we've been suspicious ever since.  He took a fake sick day one day.  Huh?  He took a fake sick day one day.  And then we called him on it.  And then.  And you guys got to take fake sick days.  Because if you take personal days, you run out of personal days.  Right?  Yeah.  And you're not allowed to take sick days unless you're really sick.  So you got to do the fake sick day.  And they give you a certain amount of sick days. 
[01:12:30]  And if you don't take them, they don't reimburse you.  Or they don't give you a buyout for your sick days.  Which is so stupid.  Because they just force you to take them.  I think the other thing is that this bothers Eric more than it bothers any of us.  Like if I took a sick day tomorrow and you guys called me, I'd run with the bit.  But it really bothers him that we call him.  He hates it.  No, no, no.  If this was something that just kind of started, that's different.  But it's always me.  Eric doesn't like.  Because it bothers him.  Always.  Eric hates having his integrity questioned even though he doesn't have much. 
[01:13:00]  No, I just hate seeing.  No matter what I do, my shit's under a microscope when everyone else does.  No one gives a fuck about it.  Because that's your weakness.  This show's all about we find someone's weakness and we just fucking attack.  Yeah, like when we called you on your honeymoon.  Yours is your work and personal life.  Yeah, that was a fucking reason.  You really got upset about it.  And that's why we kept calling you.  Oh, I wonder why.  I wasn't even in the country.  And you fucking called me with whale noises and other shit.  I forgot.  So why isn't he playing along?  That's your weakness.  Fuck all of you.  Yeah, well, it's funny. 
[01:13:30]  You do this shit constantly.  I thought it was just honeymoon.  Constantly.  Not wrong with taking a fake sick day.  Just say you took a fake sick day.  It's okay.  Please admit it.  Is that me calling out sick?  What's wrong?  A little puss around the blowhole.  Sounds sick.  Yeah, what's the matter?  Someone is on the phone saying they delivered Iraq's furniture to his house yesterday. 
[01:14:00]  Ah, shit.  Do you want me to take this call?  Yeah, it must be a fucking steel company.  Eric?  Sorry.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This guy's right, I think.  Dr. O.  Or Ow.  Hello.  Hello.  Quick, go.  Yes, it's Dr. Hal.  Okay.  And I was calling to let E-Rock or Eric know the whole reason y'all give him a hard time  is because you miss him, and the show just doesn't run right without him there in the 
[01:14:30]  booth.  You couldn't be further from the truth.  I agree.  Oh, man.  Yep.  I agree.  We had a tough show yesterday because you weren't here.  Do you think this show is tough without Eric?  Yep.  I mean, everything flowed pretty smooth yesterday.  Fantastic.  Eric was out yesterday?  Oh, no.  So many people are saying, listen to his voice now.  Oh, yeah.  It's not a hint of a sore throat.  He's got the power of Pavarotti in his voice now.  That's true.  In the shape of Pavarotti under his voice. 
[01:15:00]  And the only thing that was also suspicious was that he said he's had a sore throat since  Sunday, but on Monday he was screaming at Kenny, and his voice wasn't cracked.  So was he yelling at Kenny?  The intern.  The whole intern thing.  So maybe you blew out your voice yelling at Kenny.  I didn't blow out my voice.  I can talk fine.  Let me go to Russ in Indiana.  Russ has something for E-Rock.  Eric, please, tell these skinny little fucking cunts to shut the fuck up. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, hey.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Team E-Rock.  You got a supporter, E-Rock?  Yeah, do I?  That's right.  Because these motherfuckers, all they are is jealous.  They pick on you constantly.  Tell you what.  Do what I do.  Hit them with your fucking stomach and they'll shut the fuck up.  Oh.  I see.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Hey.  Troy.  I mean.  You're just shaking your head.  I don't know.  I don't know what else to say.  You know.  It's the same bullshit. 
[01:16:00]  You know that.  But Eric wants to make fun of you because you drink wheat grass.  I don't know if you heard that.  Yeah, that's fine.  No, I thought that was going to be the normal rant.  You're coming in where you turn your head sideways like Stewie Griffin and go, you're so unhealthy.  Well, I think your appearance speaks for itself.  Okay.  It does.  Sorry, I'm not attractive enough for you, Troy.  No.  It's not about being attractive.  It's just about being healthy.  And we've had this discussion and I said I appreciate it, but you don't need to keep forcing this issue.  Okay.  But you understand that if I'm called in here to give my opinion, I have to give my opinion. 
[01:16:30]  If nobody calls me in here, I'm not going to come in here.  You know that.  That's fair.  Okay.  So then I'm sorry.  But, you know, if I'm in here and they ask me to come in, I'm going to say what's up.  Were you asked to come in and give your opinion yesterday?  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  Well, this guy on Twitter writes,  Don't Judge E-Rock Radio.  Plug for E-Rock's Twitter.  Ooh.  Until you've eaten a mile of his food. 
[01:17:00]  Sorry.  I'm just reading.  So you think his appearance speaks for itself?  Well, he's not healthy.  I think that.  Would you agree with me on that statement?  Well, it takes the most fake sick days, so.  Really?  Would you agree with me that since you've known him, he's put on a lot of weight?  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  E-Rock, apparently the whole crew thinks that you're phony bolognes. 
[01:17:30]  He's my language.  What did you do yesterday?  I slept most of the day.  Slept most of the day.  Sloth.  And then what?  Got up.  And then?  Did some stuff.  Late on the couch.  Did you check your throat again when you got up for that white stuff?  I drank some stuff.  What'd you drink?  The Tylenol citrus.  Gravy.  Oh, my God.  He even has to make his Tylenol tasty.  Tylenol citrus.  It's the daytime.  Everything has to be a treat.  Everything has to be a treat.  A treat.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Tylenol citrus.  That sounds delicious.  So we have sloth, gluttony.  What else?  Right.  Seven deadly.  What do we got?  Hold on.  I didn't even know you could get Tylenol citrus.  That sounds terrific.  The daytime one.  Hold on.  Sloth.  Yeah.  Gluttony.  I would say greed because he always wants more.  Autographs.  Yeah.  Or things.  Yeah.  He's got greed.  Yeah.  Why is he taking Tylenol citrus?  Yeah.  For a sore throat.  Envy.  Because he's green with it.  Yeah.  Multi-symptoms.  You said you just had a sore throat. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  The multi-symptom takes care of a sore throat.  It's a multi-symptom.  Multi-symptom.  Okay.  Sorry.  I mispronounced it.  It handles sore throat.  It throws a little fat from the soreness.  Yeah.  The big fucking pelican gullet or whatever.  I didn't see that.  You did it.  I didn't see that.  You did it.  So, Iraq, you just had some stuff to do around the house and you just felt like sleeping  in.  You're entitled.  No.  But thank you for all your concern and your opinions.  Yeah.  I agree. 
[01:19:00]  You're entitled to sleep in.  Troy, I think he's believable right now.  All right.  Well, we'll see.  You didn't think he was sick, though?  No.  Of course not.  He just wanted a day off.  But he's just not honest.  He's not an honest person about anything.  Wow.  About anything.  Well, he just, you know, it's just everything is always like, he doesn't cheat.  Like, he's honest about it.  He's a faithful guy with women.  He's not like this.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not talking about that.  I mean, Sam, back me up.  I mean, isn't it like always, you always have to second guess what he's saying and you catch, 
[01:19:30]  you hear him say one thing and then something.  You got to translate it almost, right?  Yeah.  It's something else.  What does that really mean?  Throw it through a filter?  Yeah.  He does tend to speak in code and he does tend to act like whatever he's saying is on  a need to know basis.  Everything's very on the ass.  Half the time it's like, what do you think about, you know, what I'm going to use?  Like, you'll say, hey, what's number one on the countdown this week?  And he'll go, don't worry about it.  You'll find out.  And you go, just tell me what it is.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just say what it is? 
[01:20:00]  Well, it's that fake stuff we've talked about.  Yeah.  It's insane.  He does that with text messages and all.  Why do you want to be so intriguing?  He does.  He wants to be a man of mystery.  You're not a man of mystery.  He wrote me a text yesterday.  What did he say?  What did he say?  Cough?  Dash cough?  Well, didn't we just...  Ouch.  But we talked about the vague thing.  He goes, I know you hate to talk on the phone, but need to talk to you a sec.  Important.  Ew.  A sec?  Who's that?  All right.  Oh, that was when Iraq...  And remember, we talked about how he's always vague. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, very vague.  Always vague.  Because, mister, I publicly stated, I will not answer my phone for any reason.  That's the only way I said, look, I needed to talk to you.  You should...  What do you need to talk to him about?  How about a little preface in the text as to what the conversation will be about?  It turns out I might do an interview, but it's like, just say that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just say...  Are you interviewing with other people?  That was for something else, but that wasn't the reason.  I remember...  That was the reason my...  I called you right back.  That was the reason?  I remember when I had asked.  That was the reason. 
[01:21:00]  What?  That wasn't the reason.  What was the reason?  It wasn't for an interview.  It was for something else.  What was it?  Yesterday?  Yes.  It was about a fucking interview.  No, it was not.  Oh, man.  How intriguing.  Mysterious.  Oh, my God.  Sarah loves this.  How intriguing.  I called you back.  You said some magazine...  That was not the conversation.  Oh, man.  Now he's talking about you.  That wasn't it.  I got to find out what it is.  What are you talking about?  That was not the conversation.  That was two days ago.  Yesterday's conversation was totally different.  What was it?  What was it? 
[01:21:30]  His sickness?  It was about maybe recommending somebody for a certain position.  Oh.  You know what?  He's right.  Oh, damn it.  Holy fuck.  I thought I had him or I was...  Recommending somebody for a position.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I just got scared.  I thought I had you.  Good.  I think I know.  No, you're right.  You think you've cracked the riddle?  I think I have.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's recommending someone be hired. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  What?  Or made an assistant production guy or an audio guy.  Oh, but who here?  All right.  Wow.  I love how Troy just kind of brings it all in one nice package.  But what else is he not honest about?  I never noticed.  It's just little things that just add up.  You know?  It's just little things here and there where he's just not...  He doesn't give you the full story.  He just gives you these vagaries.  He gives you like a fraction of the information and then...  Will, is he honest about the number of autographs he's getting from a given person? 
[01:22:30]  No.  Oh, no.  Not at all.  Oh.  No.  He was...  He was...  Remember the charity auction?  I'm sure he did some of that, though.  Shit.  I don't remember doing the charity auction.  I don't even want to beat him up about that because every once in a while he'll give you  something.  You're like, holy fuck, that's kind of nice.  I reckon he's very thoughtful.  He's thoughtful.  So I almost don't even want to go down that road because I get something out of it every  once in a while.  What road with this charity auction?  We tried to do two and nobody would take the tax responsibility for the second one. 
[01:23:00]  What's tax responsibility?  The voice is smooth as silk right now.  I'm hearing not one gravelly moment in everything.  I'm not trying to fake anything.  Hey, road dog's here.  Well, how come it was crackly this morning when you first started?  The road dog.  The road dog's in the house.  It was also 5.30 in the morning.  I wish there was a doctor around here that could check out his throat.  Oh, here he said he checked it himself.  He had a white stuff in there so he doesn't have strep throat.  Dr. Nagel checked it.  It can't just completely clear up in a day. 
[01:23:30]  No one said it cleared up.  Dr. Gay?  I said I don't have strep throat.  So you still have a sore throat.  Yes.  But if somebody examined your throat, they could tell.  Yeah, but you went to, you checked your own throat for the white stuff, remember?  Yeah.  What's this?  It's not there.  Give me one.  Where's my envelope?  What is this stuff?  I don't know.  Hey, road dog.  Do you think Iraq was sick yesterday?  Be honest.  I am happier than pig and shit because I'm going to see Bruce tomorrow, so.  Wait a minute.  Hold on. 
[01:24:00]  I don't care.  Wait a minute.  These had me picked up?  I know.  What a pain in the ass.  We're not on a list?  Yeah, you're on a list to pick up your tickets.  But last time for McCartney, we just went there.  But Ant didn't.  I found out.  He had to go do some weird shit to get his tickets.  Yeah, I had to fucking, it was like a mission.  I had to go to a hotel, go up in the elevator, get, go into a room.  I heard if you guys don't want to pick up, I could tell a person, we could send somebody  to get them.  Pick them up!  Yeah, I'd rather let somebody go, but I don't want to go and fucking go to that hotel.  Unless they're here.  They're here.  Where are they?  No.  They're at the hotel. 
[01:24:30]  I don't want to go to a hotel and get them.  Well, you gotta.  I'm doing an interview today.  I can't stand on a line outside the hotel door like a piece of shit.  Pretty much.  I'm going to be there.  Had it.  Can somebody get them for me?  Because I have, I won't say where it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Are you going tomorrow?  I need to get you in.  Yeah, I'll be unhappy.  That's great.  I gotta bring somebody.  Huh?  I don't have a girl.  I ain't got no bitch. 
[01:25:00]  Well, Roland, you think he was out sick?  Well, he was taking holes and he was cacking all, cacking, coughing and all that.  Yeah, yeah.  So, because he, it was like.  That was the pre-show.  He was doing a little pre-show to the sickness.  I don't know.  I didn't want to get sick, so.  He looks sick to me.  Who wants to go to Bruce with me?  Nobody?  Who wants to go to Bruce?  I'm just going for the people.  I'm going to sit there and listen to that fucking droning.  I mean, I'm kidding.  I love Bruce.  I'll tell you where I'm going. 
[01:25:30]  It's a joke.  I want to see.  I'm not a huge Springsteen fan, but I respect him enough.  It's like, if I have a chance to see him in a venue of that size.  Oh, yeah.  What?  That's a gig he'll remember forever because these guys doing the Apollo.  Like, if you met McCartney in 10 years and said, I was at your Apollo show, he'd know exactly what show.  Get away from me.  Yeah.  Would you stop talking to me?  Cut it out.  But Bruce, I want to see in a venue like that because it's going to be amazing.  It's probably a great – I'm sure it's a great show.  Yes, I know.  I heard that close to three hours.  Oh, my God. 
[01:26:00]  Do you think there'll be celebrities there?  I do know.  Yay!  Any line on who?  You've heard some things.  You usually have your –  It's going to be the same crowd as McCartney.  Obviously.  It's going to be the same –  Yeah, probably.  I don't know.  Can I ask –  Can I ask everyone a question?  Yes, I will take a picture.  How much money do you think the company has spent on this?  Oh, my God.  A lot.  And I guarantee Springsteen is not – he'll probably donate his money to a charity.  He's that type of guy.  But you've got to imagine they've spent a fucking fortune on this. 
[01:26:30]  I'm going to ask Bruce what he gets when I see him.  I would say a couple mil minimum.  A couple mil minimum.  Those are names he'll never submit to us for guests.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Who's going?  I've got a picture with one.  Pass it around.  Yeah?  Is Clinton coming?  No.  Is the president coming?  He is a Bruce fan.  He went to the last Bruce fan.  I know.  That's my last guy.  I played a saxophone.  Do you think he's going to get near Clinton or no?  If he's there, I mean, if you're on the floor.  Fucking Secret Service all over him.  Who's going?  Yeah.  What does it say on that napkin? 
[01:27:00]  People, big celebrities.  I just know a few.  People, big celebrities.  What happened?  Iraq, you're off the hook.  Congrats.  Oh, Iraq.  You're off the hook.  He's off the hook because the line broke.  We moved on, I think, Iraq.  You're good.  Am I sitting next to Anthony?  I hope so.  I don't know.  Who am I going to talk to?  I want to sit with Jimmy.  Who's going with me?  Come on.  It's a big ticket.  Nobody wants to go.  Oh, Jimmy.  I hope he wants to go with me. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  I got to read one tweet.  Mike from BX.  Mike.  Oh, but I can't wait until Iraq quits and then you will be effed.  Troy Kwan is a fucking piece of shit who is enragingly jealous.  Oh, my God.  Eric Radio on fucking Iraq right now.  Yeah, exactly.  They are coming out of the woodwork to support Iraq on this one.  You have to work with him.  That's fine.  Holy shit.  That's true.  That is true.  Troy, you want to comment on that tweet? 
[01:28:00]  I mean, exactly.  You don't have to work with him.  You just know what he is.  Because these people relate to him being the, you know, the.  Back on the hook.  A fat guy that's just, you know, struggling at his job and, you know.  Oh, wow.  A fat guy struggling at his job.  That's such an HR issue, man.  You say that there are a bunch of people who empathize with a basic lazy slug.  Of course.  Troy Kwan on Twitter. 
[01:28:30]  That can be the worst thing ever said about you, Eric.  Wow.  You got to defend yourself.  And so compact.  Again, see that nicely wrapped package.  A fat guy struggling.  Struggling.  And that's why they struggled.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know what I mean?  He gets beat up on the air and fat people are like, yeah, that's me.  Fuck those guys picking on him.  Oh, man.  You know?  Yeah, this is fine.  A bunch of fatos who are also struggling who are just kind of defending him.  Yeah, and these people don't.  They probably suck to work with, too.  There's probably people at work that are like, dude, you're a fat, lazy fuck. 
[01:29:00]  But, of course, they're just pissed off because they get picked on.  So, basically.  Instead of changing.  Instead of.  Yeah.  Instead of.  Being fat, lazy fuck.  Yeah.  Instead of going like, okay, why are these people picking on me?  They're picking on me because of this, this, and this.  For not being honest.  For being fat.  Like, I'm going to get in shape.  I'm going to start being honest.  Lazy fuck, you said, too.  Yeah.  So, you think that they're bonding with Eric in a level of fatness?  Of course.  And laziness.  And laziness.  And sloth.  And being abused by their coworkers.  They're also fat, lazy victims. 
[01:29:30]  Yes.  And fucks.  And a lot of doctors now checking in saying you could have strep or tonsillitis without that.  Without spots.  Without the white stuff.  Or Tostito scrapes.  Yeah.  Tostito scrapes.  But according to Eric, he checked his throat.  No white spots, so he's good.  No strep.  Dr. Nagel checked his own throat.  Yes.  It's true.  I wish you would have checked it with a shotgun bow.  I saw it on me that, Eric.  It's just a funny joke.  He's not laughing.  He's not laughing.  No.  I haven't looked at this.  I haven't looked at it in 10 minutes.  I'm too scared. 
[01:30:00]  I want him to check his throat with a .45.  Oh, stop it.  His throat hurts from eating Quint.  No.  That's just mean.  Oh, no.  He's not Jaws.  Oh, that was funny?  Oh, no.  That was funny.  He may be ill.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What day were you on?  Yesterday?  Wednesday?  Monday and Tuesday.  Do you mean in a rapper sense?  He's ill.  He's ill, yo.  Monday and Tuesday were significantly early days in terms of... 
[01:30:30]  His departure.  Oh!  No.  So he may not have been feeling well.  Oh, okay.  So you're backing his story.  When did he leave on Monday and Tuesday?  I'm not sure what you mean.  Ah.  Earlier than he was supposed to?  I don't know if there's a supposed to.  You know, I don't know if there's a rigid time schedule, but right.  Earlier than his typical.  So we should thank Iraq.  He could have very easily been out all week.  Yeah.  And you know, that's not fair either, to be honest, because he's in here earlier than 
[01:31:00]  everybody else.  Did you say earlier?  Yeah, right?  No.  No, definitely not.  Oh, boy.  Why'd you bring that up?  All right.  You want to go into this?  Fine.  Trouble.  This is great.  Late to bed.  Late to rise.  Monday, I left at 10 to 1 to go to the dentist.  Then I came back here.  Tuesday, I left.  Why would you go to the dentist again?  Oh, my God.  That would be a nightmare.  I didn't get the dentist sick.  Did he come in with a hazmat suit?  You're not telling us why you went to the dentist? 
[01:31:30]  No.  More mystery.  Why?  For me, right?  Why'd you go to the dentist?  Boy, it's either a root canal or a cleaning.  No, it's not.  All right.  Fine.  This will take you to 830.  I had to go in there and get the mouthpiece that I used to sleep with readjusted.  So why wouldn't you just say that in the first place?  Because I didn't have to fucking tell anybody until, oh, he left early Monday.  No, I didn't.  I left at 1 o'clock.  Like, why does that have to be secretive?  Like, that's part of your life.  Just be honest about your life.  Because it's not shit I need to volunteer with everybody.  Why not?  I mean, everybody else volunteers every part of their... 
[01:32:00]  Sam talks about his fucking circumcised dick and his mom every three seconds.  Right.  In the same breath.  Like, why wouldn't you just be honest about yourself and who you are?  I'll stop in and knock into your office and let you know every little thing I do.  No, but when it comes up on the air, that's what I'm talking about.  I just brought it up on the air.  No one else did ask.  You didn't want to bring it up on the air.  You didn't want to bring it up.  You're saying he wanted to just kind of keep it quiet.  Yeah, he was like, oh, he didn't want to talk about his mouthpiece.  Like, who gives a fuck about your mouthpiece?  Just talk about it.  Yeah.  Wait, when somebody says, why did you have to go to the doctor? 
[01:32:30]  They could have gone another ten minutes about food or sleeping or the mouthpiece or whatever.  But now the sickness thing is more suspicious because we thought he might have left early  because he was feeling under the weather.  What did you have to do with the mouthpiece?  What happened with the mouthpiece?  The mouthpiece broke.  Of course it did.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Why did you say that?  Of course it did.  Why be vague?  Why keep this a secret?  It was cleverly disguised as a burger.  Now all that chomping in his sleep. 
[01:33:00]  Those nice dreams of eating.  Yeah.  Yum, yum, yum.  Oh, yum, yum, yum, yum.  I couldn't sleep.  I was counting cakes.  Is that how he sleeps, Jimmy?  Yum, yum, yum.  Yum, yum, yum.  Yum, yum, yum.  So what is it?  Is it an apnea mouthpiece?  It's the first one the dentist had to make out of tungsten.  Thought the change would hold.  So, Iraq, how did it break?  Honestly, did you drop it or step on it or what happened?  No, the back, the upper back part of it chipped off. 
[01:33:30]  What's that?  Oh, God.  So wait, how does it work?  What is that mouthpiece?  It keeps your mouth open so that you don't show up while you sleep.  People could just drop a fish in.  Sorry, I stepped on that.  It's okay.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  It's just...  Troy, you're getting killed, by the way.  It's never ending.  It's fine.  As much as it's great fodder for the show, you are absolutely losing the Iraq battle. 
[01:34:00]  And I always do.  And it's completely fine by me.  I really don't mind.  All right, so that took care of Tuesday.  Then he left early what?  Wednesday?  That takes care of Monday.  I mean, Monday.  Tuesday, I left around 1.30 after our meeting.  I'm sorry.  The mouthpiece, I have to know.  Is it like a sports mouthpiece?  I know it's for apnea, and I've actually started getting one.  How does it fit?  What is it?  How do you not choke on it?  There's little things on the back part of your teeth that keeps your jaw open normally 
[01:34:30]  than it would be, like kind of locked so you can't close your mouth all the way.  Can you still breathe through your mouth?  Well, you still breathe through your nose if you can breathe through your nose.  I can't.  But it keeps your tongue from, like, sliding back into your throat so you don't choke while  you sleep.  So how – is it comfortable?  You don't even notice it once you start wearing it.  You get used to it.  You don't even notice it's on anymore.  Why won't it fucking fall into your throat?  Yeah.  Because it locks on.  It's like if you've played baseball, you know, when you bite into it and then you boil  it in water.  It's a mouthpiece to protect your teeth.  But it's on the top and the bottom, and it's hooked together. 
[01:35:00]  And it just keeps your jaw locked open like this so that you don't –  How wide open is your mouth?  Um, maybe half an inch.  It looks – it sounds uncomfortable.  Yeah, it sure does.  No, it's not.  All right.  So that takes care of Monday.  Did it help you?  Are you sleeping better?  When I got it fixed, yeah.  I sleep much better with it.  Do you think you're sleeping much better, Troy?  I guess.  I don't know.  I mean, he's still late to work, right?  He don't snore.  Oh, fuck. 
[01:35:30]  They're killing Troy on Twitter.  Are they not happy with his –  He's getting killed.  Why?  I love it, though.  They don't like that he's fucking calling me.  He's getting killed.  You rock out on his business.  Well, here we go.  You sit in a while.  Another fat guy.  Here's Bill.  Bill in New Hampshire.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Bill.  Hey, guys.  I can't see if you are, but Troy should really shut the fuck up.  He's talking about going to get rhinoplasty at the end of the month.  Are you shitting me?  Yeah, but at least I'm honest about it.  Yeah, Troy's getting a nose shot.  Not a good mat.  Pretty gay, dude.  That's pretty fucking gay.  Be a man to keep your nose away.  He wants a nicer nose.  No, my nose was broken, dude. 
[01:36:00]  I can't breathe out of the one side.  Oh, it's for –  Bud, you didn't admit you want that bump taken down.  Well, because I broke my nose and there's a bump in it, so if they're going to fix it,  they might as well make it look nice, right?  I think your nose is fine.  Yeah, I can't breathe out of this side, so I have to get my septum fixed.  People are saying, Iraq, if you can't breathe out of your mouth, just use your blowhole.  Do you have one of those?  People or you?  I love the people are saying.  People are saying.  Tom and Philly.  Go ahead, Tom.  He caught you out of that.  I think he caught me. 
[01:36:30]  First of all, first of all, Sam, I like Sam.  I like you a lot, but you are very lucky in life that no one has ever knocked your teeth in.  Congrats.  I would admit that.  Yeah, I agree with that, too.  Yeah, I'm surprised no one has taken – and I don't want anyone to take a shot.  Taking a swing at you?  I'm a wiry little guy.  I don't want anyone to take a shot at you, but I am amazed no one has –  I think he just knows how to wiggle out of situations.  Oh, yeah, like a worm.  Sam thinks life is like wrestling, though.  He grabs the mic, he starts mouthing off and thinks, like, this guy knows not to hit me. 
[01:37:00]  This is all a bit.  It's wrestling.  It's cool, right?  Sure.  Until somebody just plows their fist into your face.  You almost got clocked.  When?  Pat Duffy.  Oh, Pat Duffy.  That was really close.  That would have hurt, too.  Pat's an animal.  Yeah, that would have been an injury.  He would have fucking – he would have killed you, dude.  He would have broken my jaw.  Yeah.  Are you good with Pat now?  I mean, I – he would break my – he would break my jaw.  But are you guys good now?  We're good enough. 
[01:37:30]  I think you're – yeah, I think there's a lot of weird underlining.  Yeah, but he's cool enough that we can have a conversation.  All right, Tom and Philly, go ahead.  What else?  Troy, you sound like you're a good dude, basically.  And you and Eric were good friends.  He's pretty tight.  What happened between the two of you to drive you to this point?  Because Eric sounds like a good dude, too.  He sounds exhausting.  But he sounds pretty cool.  This guy has a – you know, this is the most observant listener we've ever had.  Yes, it really is. 
[01:38:00]  Everything is right on.  Because he listens closely.  You can hear this shit.  Thank you.  Good day.  All right.  Let me go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Yes.  It's because you asked, Jimmy.  People, yeah, they're not digging on Troy right now.  Oh, yeah.  Steve, go ahead.  Troy.  Yo.  Don't bother getting that nose ticked.  It's only a matter of time before somebody just punches you in the face again.  Whoa.  Could be him.  Yeah.  Whoa.  That's fine.  Whoa.  Whoa.  He's been naked nose. 
[01:38:30]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Eric, a bunch of people –  Don't punch him in the face.  Huh?  What's that?  Go suck some more face in a bar.  Go suck some more face in a bar.  Oh, wow.  Kissing guys.  Oh, okay.  You told me guys?  I told that story yesterday.  Yeah.  You made that other guy in a bar?  No.  The way I got my nose busted is I was – this guy had – he had wronged me pretty bad,  and I was trying to get revenge.  And I went up to him, and I kissed him on his lips.  You called him I was going to fuck him.  And he headbutted me pretty bad and split my nose open. 
[01:39:00]  Would you have fucked him if you said all right?  We didn't ask that yet.  It was just more just trying to be degrading.  Well, what if you said all right, then –  No, I mean, I would have probably just knocked his teeth out of his mouth.  Were you embarrassed that he broke your nose after your big moment?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you know, I was acting like a fucking asshole, and I got what I deserved.  How many years ago was this?  Ten years ago.  I didn't have insurance, so finally I can get it fixed.  So I finally just get to the point where I'm sleeping fucked up.  I can't breathe, and I'm just like, I'm going to get it fixed.  Well, people are saying Eric is sleeping bad because – I mean, his throat is sore because 
[01:39:30]  his mouth is open when he's sleeping.  You know what?  That'll dry out your fucking throat.  Fucking your mouth must be very dry when you're like, oh, they really are saying that.  I have not had problems with that ever.  But are you – can you sleep on your back now?  I wake up on – like, I don't – I can't go to sleep on my back, but I wake up on my  back now.  I couldn't do that before because I would choke and everything.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And not on a donut or ice cream sandwich or any of that other shit.  No, no, no.  You're all thinking it, so I'm just stating it.  You're not saying it anyway. 
[01:40:00]  I can see you choking on an apple or –  Don't you think instead of just getting all this weird fangle-dangle stuff for your  mouth, just get into shape?  Oh, that would – ooh.  It's got to be – I mean, instead of trying to work out, Jimmy, and you still have the  same sleeping problem.  Oh, now it's about Jimmy.  No, but he raises a good point.  But I do think that if you're lighter, it does help.  It is part of it, yes.  But I'm on Weight Watchers.  Me too.  Are you?  For how long?  I do the points.  How many points a day?  I'm way ahead of you.  How many?  48. 
[01:40:30]  You get 48 points a day.  Is that a lot, Jimmy?  I went to 48 one day, but I had to use my fucking workout points and stuff.  I get 33 a day.  It sounds just arduous.  I can't imagine.  My problem is, not that anybody cares, but diet soda, which does put weight on you because  your body thinks it's – you know, whatever.  And fucking pretzels.  I love pretzels.  Diet soda is zero points.  What the fuck could you get from pretzels?  That's carbs and shit.  It's all empty, shitty, salty calories.  It's not good.  If I was going to get fat, it wouldn't be because of pretzels.  Oh, man.  Fuck that.  I'd go for much better stuff.  I love pretzels. 
[01:41:00]  How many points is a Coke float?  I don't drink Coke floats.  How long have you been on Weight Watchers?  On a steak martini.  I only started it.  Huh?  I was supposed to have started it right after New Year's, and then I stopped when I moved.  It's March.  And then I restarted it.  Holy shit.  It's March.  Troy's shaking his head.  By the way, Eric, in case you're wondering, you make it so easy.  Oh, do I?  Wait.  Yes, you said you're going to start Weight Watchers the first of the year, and it's now March.  Well, of course you're going to pick up on that. 
[01:41:30]  I'm so great for this show, aren't I?  I don't even know what's being sarcastic about it anymore.  So when did you start?  I started originally after New Year's.  I stopped towards the end of January, and then I started up again on Friday.  One month on, one month on.  What made you start on Friday?  When you, I forgot I had it until you brought it up.  Oh, my God.  But I was like, oh, yeah, I should be doing that.  Obesity?  No, wait.  What do you mean you had it?  I just threw it on my phone.  I did.  I had it on my phone, but I forgot I still had it until you brought it up. 
[01:42:00]  Do you want to hate about Weight Watchers, by the way?  You'll fucking go to enter, like, a Lean Cuisine.  Lean Cuisine.  Like, Boston, say a Len Cuisine.  Len Cuisine.  I know him.  They don't have that brand because they're territorial, so you have to start adding the fucking fiber.  You got to do it manually.  Yeah, I hate that shit.  There's also an app where you can scan the barcode and it doesn't pull you.  I have that, too.  Can I do that?  Yeah, you just scan the barcode and it should enter it in.  Fancy, fancy.  Nice.  Wow.  All right, well.  You think he's going to stick with it, Troy?  No. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, shit.  I mean, let's run down how many diets he's done.  How many have he done?  There have been a few since we've known you.  Yeah, we're talking about this on the after show.  Yeah.  How many diets, Eric?  A seafood diet.  He eats all the food that he looks at.  Good one.  That's not how it's said, Chip.  Eric?  What's that?  He just sits there and looks at you.  There have been a few.  Creep.  How many?  Let's see.  South Beach?  I tried that.  That didn't last night.  You washed up on it?  Sorry.  Oh, no.  Oh, will you?  I just love that one.  That's right. 
[01:43:00]  I can't believe I thought no one would have hit that already.  Sorry, Eric.  Go ahead.  Fatkins.  Steve from Bayshore says the Fatkins diet.  Oh, God.  Which other ones have there been?  No, I never did the Atkins diet.  I tried the South Beach.  Didn't like that.  Oh, motherfucker.  Fat Smash?  Oh, yeah.  Fat Smash did that.  Amity Island?  Fat Smash should work.  That's Dr. 
[01:43:30]  Kittner diet.  Did you hurt your jaw when you bumped it on the ice when you were eating Richard Harris?  I don't know that reference, but I'm sure it's funny.  Orca.  Orca.  Okay, yeah, I didn't see it.  You didn't see Orca?  No.  What's wrong with you?  I didn't either.  Doesn't watch his own movies.  Yeah, we've heard that from a lot of Hollywood stars. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, wow.  All right, is that it?  So you're back on the diet.  That's good.  So we'll see how that works out.  Yeah.  Troy's a cunt.  Oh, wow.  What's up, John?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Well, first of all, I want to defend E-Rock.  You're not making it fucking easy, E-Rock.  How many goddamn diets?  Three.  Plus a personal trainer.  I'm sad also, man, but come on.  Listen, I just want to say, Troy, mind your own fucking business, you still righteous cunt. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, shit.  Hey, buddy, were you listening to the show?  Were you listening to the show?  Yes.  Were you listening?  So, did I ask to come in here?  Did I ask to come in?  If somebody asked me to come into the studio and give my opinion on something, that's what  I'm going to do.  No, you always have a fucking opinion.  You, you, you're too fat, E-Rock.  You should be like me.  I'm fucking skinny.  I'm fucking cool.  I'm hip.  You faggot.  That's right.  I mean, do you think Troy's trying to be cool? 
[01:45:00]  Sir?  Troy just has a little more discipline.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, discipline.  It's just, listen, E-Rock's fat.  And you're a fat, and you're a fat guy too, right?  I am.  All right, good.  We'll fucking lose some weight, you fat fuck.  Oh, damn.  Wow.  For real, dude.  I mean, like, you can't hear, like, all I'm doing is saying, look, yeah, he doesn't  tell the truth, he's dishonest about some things, and he's overweight.  I'm just stating the obvious.  You're always so self-righteous about it, though.  People like me have worked out, E-Rock.  You know what?  Not everyone has this as easy as you do, okay? 
[01:45:30]  Why do I have it easy?  How do you, how do you, and how do you know anything about me, you fucking asshole?  You know, you know whatever I say on the air.  You don't know anything about me or what I have going on in my life.  You don't know me.  Yeah.  Absolutely right.  Yes, because you're a fucking celebrity DJ.  That's right.  Troy Kwan.  Okay, so great.  So what does that have to do with anything?  Nothing.  All right, I gotta go, buddy.  I make fucking A, dude.  If you're gonna call up here and make a point about something, like...  Well, Mark is gonna make that point.  Mark in Buffalo.  Mark. 
[01:46:00]  Hey, Troy, let me ask you something.  Are you basically saying that because people are overweight, they're automatically lazy  pieces of shit?  Is that what you're saying?  Pretty much.  I think you're...  I think you're...  Hold on, hold on.  I think your appearance says a lot about who you are as a person.  Yes.  Okay.  So the fact that I work my ass off 10, 12 hours a day, I bump boats on the side, I plow  at the airport on the side.  I'm always fucking working.  And yeah, I'm 5'9", 240 pounds. 
[01:46:30]  I'm a big dude.  Okay.  I'm a fat piece of lazy shit.  You're fat.  You could probably...  You know what, dude?  You could probably stand to lose a few pounds.  You could probably stand...  You could probably stand to watch what you're eating.  Maybe don't drink so much beer.  Maybe fucking go...  Maybe run around the block a little bit.  Maybe don't eat too late.  Maybe get a good night's sleep and maybe you'll get a little healthier.  And you're gonna tell me...  How old...  Dude, how old are you?  I'm 38.  Okay, so 38 years old.  So, why don't...  You don't think at some point if you're overweight you're gonna start running into health complications? 
[01:47:00]  All right, well, listen.  Let me tell you something.  My blood pressure is 110 over 64 and my cholesterol is next to nothing.  Okay, well, are you happy then?  Are you a happy dude?  I would like to lose a few pounds.  Okay, well, then what the fuck is the problem, you stupid asshole?  Quit fucking eating lasagna and fucking eat a salad.  Quit eating lasagna and eat a salad, you fat fuck!  Yeah, there you go, yeah.  Well, you're not hearing what I'm saying. 
[01:47:30]  Don't eat fucking cheeseburgers at 10 o'clock at night.  Maybe you'll lose a couple pounds.  I don't eat cheeseburgers.  Maybe don't drink soda.  Don't drink fucking beer and soda.  Drink water.  Maybe you'll lose a fucking few pounds.  Water tastes like shit.  Well, of course it does.  That's what Eric's problem is.  He puts treats in it all the time.  Treats?  Does he treat his water, Sam?  I'd put iced tea in it.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  He's got little pouches of powder filling up an entire drawer.  Eric, when was the last time you just had a glass of water?  I usually have a bottle of water at night. 
[01:48:00]  A bottle of water at night?  Yeah, where no one can see it.  Oh, you're lying, you're saying.  Oh, you're saying you're lying.  Wow.  Can I keep a journal and check in with you, Troy?  No.  Why do you have to have so many treats?  That is convenient that it's one bottle at night, you know?  I mean, let's be honest.  Water sucks.  No one enjoys drinking water.  I enjoy good water.  Why do you treat your water?  Oh, I love that.  Why do you treat it?  I put iced tea in it.  That's making it a treat.  I like Lipton's iced tea. 
[01:48:30]  He works hard on a daily basis.  Lipton's.  He deals with a lot of shit.  Yeah.  And so when it comes time for meals, snacks, or beverages, that's when he treats himself.  You think he likes sweets?  He's comforting himself.  He loves sweets.  He loves sweets.  He loves sandwiches.  Yeah.  You love sandwiches, E-Rog?  Sandwiches.  I gotta let Mark go, because everyone wants Troy.  He's going crazy.  Eric, you are so winning this, by the way.  Troy's being an asshole.  Tony in Cleveland.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I don't know why you guys rag on Eric. 
[01:49:00]  I'm not, and he's a nice guy, and he's a happy guy when he's not there.  Sam is an overcompensating, childish, shit-stirring little piece of shit.  Overcompensating for what?  Oh, because Eric's got the job you want and can't have, so you do everything you can do.  What job?  So you can get his job.  Get out of here.  What do I?  Yes, because if there's one thing I want, it's more responsibilities behind the scenes.  You've figured me out.  No, you just want his money. 
[01:49:30]  That's all.  You're joking.  Well, who doesn't want that fucking money?  He makes a good chance.  Come on.  Get the fuck out of here.  To be able to leave early every day?  You know what I mean?  Six figures?  Yeah.  Dude.  I leave to you the Nagel fortune.  Get the bag, Norton.  Get the bag.  You guys want Eric's job because he makes a lot more money and leaves early?  Yes.  Did I pick up on that?  Yes.  Did you pick up on that?  It'd be fucking great.  I wish I was like, oh, I just bought a house, guys.  Oh, man.  You know how fucking great that would be? 
[01:50:00]  And get to leave early on top of it?  Yeah, I got a dentist appointment.  Eric, you're saying you leave early.  Plenty of times Troy's left and I'm still here.  Oh.  I'm sure that didn't happen.  Damn it.  All right.  So what happened Tuesday then?  If he left early Monday for the dentist thing.  What happened Tuesday, Eric?  I left at 1.30 after our meeting.  I think it was probably close to 1.  We were finished about 1 o'clock.  Yeah.  He was gone after that.  I mean, I remember coming down from the meeting.  I was like, oh, Eric's gone because I had to ask you something. 
[01:50:30]  What did you have to do that you skedabbled so quickly?  Nothing.  To tear that throat.  That's true.  That's true.  Get home to his house.  Start setting his shit up.  Putting his pictures up.  His autographs.  Organizing everything.  Wait, did the charity autograph stream?  Yeah.  That's not cool.  That's not cool.  That's not cool.  That's not cool.  That was never done anything like that.  What's that?  What do you mean?  Anything that we have for the charity stuff, never.  Oh.  It's because you have like 10 autographs of the same guy.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, because the guys come in and he goes, can you sign these three for me?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim?  Yeah.  Jim.  Jim.  Hey, how you doing?  Let's go to Jim.  Somebody else should say that.  I'm sorry.  Don't worry about the how you're doing today.  Just get into it.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hi.  Hey, A-Rock.  Listen.  I went and I hit gastric bypass three years ago.  I lost six pounds in six months.  My cholesterol is normal.  No blood pressure.  And my diabetes is gone. 
[01:51:30]  Mm-hmm.  And you know what?  And Troy can suck your ass down after he's done.  You can feel sorry for yourself.  I hope you don't do that.  What do you consider gastric bypass surgery?  I don't need it and nor do I qualify for it.  Why don't you qualify?  Because I'm nowhere in that range.  What?  And how do they talk to us with no blood pressure?  No, I'm nowhere in that range.  That's crazy.  The beauty of this whole thing is people really have an image that A-Rock can't even fit through a door.  They think he's the size of Steve C.  Right.  Yes.  Speaking of which. 
[01:52:00]  What?  What happened?  Oh, he rushed to the ER yesterday.  What?  Oh, jeez.  He had problems with the gastric bypass with his staples.  See, thanks.  They got infected.  Ow.  All right.  What?  Did he have another bypass?  No.  They had to do a CAT scan and everything and he had some infection.  Yeah.  He got released at 1 o'clock this morning.  Well, you saw how much food he was eating with it.  Wait a minute.  I mean, a mound of food every single day.  He got the fucking bypass surgery years ago.  He put some weight on. 
[01:52:30]  Again, how did it get infected?  I thought it was all stapled up.  Well, he doesn't stop eating bread and drinking carbonated stuff when you're supposed to cut  that out completely.  Don't talk to yourself.  Yeah.  Third person.  So wait, that's bad for you after bypass surgery?  You can't have it at all.  For how long?  Ever.  You can't have carbonation ever.  So why would you have that?  Why would you have that?  Because he doesn't, I guess this falls into my category, he doesn't listen and pay attention  to what he's doing.  But his wife is fucking amazing.  I know.  She's a bodybuilder, man.  He was, apparently, he was throwing up nonstop for the last two days and then they took 
[01:53:00]  him to the ER, did a CAT scanning on him and turned out he was infected.  He was listening to his old production.  Oh my God.  Jesus.  Oh no.  Is he okay?  Take him all the way down.  So far, yeah.  He seems all right.  I'm glad Steve's okay.  Yeah.  Let's stop deflecting.  Let's go to Mike.  Mikey.  Yes.  Mike.  Yeah.  Troy's just a jealous fuck.  That's true.  He's old, important, skinny pants wearer, motherfucker.  Hey, you don't leave the rock alone.  You're just jealous. 
[01:53:30]  He's got a nice, cushy life and you wish you had it.  Nice, cushy belly.  That's true, too.  Wow.  I'm very surprised that no one's supporting Troy.  Steph, the guy.  Steph.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  It's so obvious what's going on here.  I mean, imagine if you went to college with some dude, you have a band, you're going to  get rich and famous, and you've got this douche who's just along for the ride, and now  fast forward 10 years later and Seth douche is making more money with you than you.  You've got to look at him every single fucking day. 
[01:54:00]  And technically...  And it's pretty obvious here.  Oh, so in your past life, E-Rock was just this little peon guy that just kind of hung  around the band.  Right.  And now this guy's saying E-Rock has loop-rocked past you.  Now he's large and in charge, as they say.  Yes.  Technically, E-Rock is Troy's boss.  Yeah.  And he used to make E-Rock do silly, stupid stuff because he wanted to hang around the  band.  Right.  Yeah, I mean...  This guy might be on to something.  And that's fine, and that very well may be a valid point, but when you just see his 
[01:54:30]  work ethic, it's just infuriating how much money he makes for what he actually does.  Wow.  Tiger in Tampa.  That does sound like a little jealousy there, though, I've got to say.  A lot of people say jealousy.  Tiger.  That's not fair.  Yeah.  I just need to know why Troy thinks because he's healthier than Eric, he's better than  Eric.  I don't think I'm better than anybody.  I don't want you to ever think that I'm ever thinking I'm better than anyone.  I think that there are things that he could do to be healthier. 
[01:55:00]  You don't think you're better than Eric?  Troy?  No, I don't think I'm better than anybody.  Troy has a big influence around here.  I haven't worn sweatpants since he told me I dress like shit.  Yeah, he did say that.  I haven't had sweatpants on since.  He's like the red carpet people.  Yeah.  He gave you a what not to wear.  Fashion police.  Fashion police.  I wanted to wear sweatpants today because I was running a bit late.  Yeah.  And I'm like, no, Troy's going to fucking call me out because I got sweatpants on.  He's going to have that.  He will.  Yeah.  He's secretly running this fucking place.  We all want to be liked by Troy. 
[01:55:30]  He's the cool kid.  He's the cool kid.  He's the cool kid on campus.  He really is.  And he's the badass.  He's not like the guy who makes all the money.  He's not at the top of the food chain.  He's just in the corner with the jacket on.  You're Fonzie.  Smoking a cigarette.  Yeah.  You're Fonzie.  So Eric, I absolutely have been influenced by Troy.  Why haven't you been influenced yet?  Because I don't care.  It doesn't influence me.  It doesn't matter, and I'm not competing for Troy's attention or affection or approval.  But the things I tell you aren't just to be a fucking asshole.  I mean, you know that you need to become healthier.  You know this is going to be an issue down the road, Eric. 
[01:56:00]  You know that.  Yeah.  You know that you're getting heavier, right?  No, I'm not getting heavier.  I was heavier.  Ooh.  Okay, but you're at the heaviest you've ever been in your life, right?  It's been a weight wash.  I'm close to it.  It's Friday.  Okay.  So you don't think that there's going to be an issue down the road?  We've discussed this.  Well, I'm just saying that's why I'm in here talking about this.  He loves me.  I'm not here to be like, you fucking asshole.  He's helping you.  Yeah, he loves you.  You do think he's an asshole.  Troy influences everyone in the studio except Eric, and that's got to frustrate the hell  out of Troy.  Oh.  Yeah, because you want to influence Eric. 
[01:56:30]  He wants to be like, well, I mean, I've tried to help Roland with this, too, and he  doesn't want any help.  Oh, boy.  Lost cause.  Troy keeps going after Eric because Eric's not influenced by Troy, so Troy keeps going after  Eric.  That explains a lot.  Okay, but do you also understand that if I was never called into the studio, you would  never know my opinion on this right now?  Well, you choose to share it.  What a loss.  That would be for everybody.  Well, you can always say, you know what, I don't have an opinion on it.  I just go back and forth.  It's the best.  These guys are the bosses.  If they ask me a question, I don't want to get called out on bullshit. 
[01:57:00]  I'm going to give them the honest answer.  Because they know you're going to be entertaining by coming in and sharing your opinion.  And have you been entertained?  Yeah, man.  Are you not entertained?  Eric should have picked up his phone yesterday.  That would have entertained the hell out of us.  I wouldn't be calling in.  Exactly.  So what's the problem?  I like that Troy's honest.  It's not a problem.  It just makes it sound like you think you're better than Eric.  I do not think I'm better than any person in this building.  That's how you come across.  I think another thing is that Troy and Eric have been friends for a long time, and Troy probably 
[01:57:30]  gets frustrated with Eric because he cares about him.  Of course.  Oh, man.  See that?  On a human being level, yes, I do care about Eric.  I want to see him healthy.  But your friendship is way over.  Well, I mean, it's just not official.  It's not the strongest it's ever been.  If one of you two stopped working here, how often would you talk to him?  I mean, I don't know.  Is seldom a good word?  What's that?  Seldom to never?  Seldom, sure.  Possibly never.  I think we'd probably actually be better friends not working together. 
[01:58:00]  Or talking.  No, I think we would talk.  I'm not seeing each other ever.  I think we'd talk.  We don't have a lot in common, so there wouldn't be a lot of common ground to meet up or do  anything wrong.  He doesn't care about it.  What do you guys have in common at this point?  I don't know.  I mean, you'd like to get exercise and get some fresh air and eat properly.  Yeah.  Was there a point, though, when you said about you were in the band and he was just a  hanger-on and now he makes more money?  Does that bother you?  I mean, that was actually a good point.  Does it bother me that he makes as much money as he does for the amount of work that he 
[01:58:30]  does?  Is that what you're asking me?  No.  The switch.  Not switch.  Just a position.  But because you were in the band and he was kind of just hanging around and now he's  in a position where you guys are equal in position, right?  No.  No, no.  Iraq's his boss.  No.  So Iraq's higher up.  Okay.  So it's kind of like a role reversal, although maybe not that extreme.  No, this is what happens.  It's exactly like when they promote somebody in the military.  They got to move him out of his group because you won't respect the promoted guy because 
[01:59:00]  he was just one of the guys.  But then when they promote him, they got to move him to some people that don't know him.  And that's usually protocol.  But see, in this case, Iraq has climbed up the ladder.  You know, you were passed over.  And now you got to look at Iraq.  So maybe there's a little animosity there.  Maybe subconsciously.  I don't think consciously there is.  I mean, he does something completely different than I do.  You know, he...  Overeat?  Well, he runs the board. 
[01:59:30]  I just sort of go, really?  Like, it's just got to go.  You didn't get enough in today?  I know, Iraq.  You are right.  I have reached my quota.  I mean, as far as titles go, yes, he has a higher title.  But I mean, we do something completely different than each other.  Yeah.  All right.  More girls that hate Troy.  Thank you, Tiger.  Let's go to Melissa in New York City.  I bet you she's ugly.  She hates Troy.  I know.  Troy, I've...  I've subscribed to Troy's Instagram.  And it's usually him, hot girls.  He fucks a lot of girls.  Out fucking, like, out in the scene. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  He's part of the scene, you know?  He fucks, like, multiple girls a week now.  Oh, it's crazy, right?  He's a DJ.  It's crazy.  Damn.  And he's just bringing chicks home.  I go to one of your parties.  You can meet...  I've introduced me to some girls.  Yeah.  Hi, ladies.  Hi, girls.  I've got some girls that love you, actually.  So, have you been boogieing down all night?  Yeah.  I'd wear my sweatshirt and do a little bit of hand dance.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd clap dance in the corner.  Hey, baby.  Yeah.  Melissa, what do you got?  You do the hustle?  Hi.  Basically, at this point, pretty much everything I wanted to say has been said, except... 
[02:00:30]  Reiterate.  You know, one of Troy's main points is that he doesn't think that Eric's honest with himself,  but Troy hasn't been honest at all.  He just keeps dismissing the points that he's jealous, inherently, of Eric and upset about  certain ways that his life course trajectory has been better than him, and I don't think  that Troy's being honest with himself about that.  Well, when Anthony said that to me, I said, quite possibly, subconsciously, yes, there  may be something there with that.  So, I'm being as honest as I can. 
[02:01:00]  I mean, I do something completely different than Eric, okay?  Eric doesn't DJ.  Eric doesn't do production.  He doesn't...  He's something completely different.  Fuck multiple girls on the daily.  Right.  So, I may be...  On the daily.  So, if I'm jealous, it's because of what he's making, his salary, of course.  I want to be making more money, Melissa.  I mean, who the fuck doesn't?  No, I understand that.  I just think it's amusing to me that you just used DJing as something that you're proud  of.  I think... 
[02:01:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, you don't see it as an art form there, Missy?  I mean, DJing...  Fuck.  I saw your fake DJing career, which is terrible.  I saw you DJ, and it was really heinous.  Oh, man.  Wait, wait, wait.  Who's this chick?  Wow.  You saw Troy DJ?  Where'd you see him DJ?  Why was he awful at DJing?  He must have fucked her wrong.  He was so uncreative.  It was so...  But where did you see me DJing?  Where'd you see it?  Where'd you see it?  I saw him at the Death Death Die show.  Oh.  Well, that was totally different. 
[02:02:00]  I was there for 20 minutes opening up for...  Oh, everything you do is different.  Oh!  That's fine.  Troy, come on.  Meet and his match right here.  It's different.  Life stream...  Everything's different.  Well, then...  I got a fellow hipster on the phone.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  You felt that way.  You know what, Melissa?  Then don't ever come out and see me DJ again.  Yeah, you.  I mean...  I tend to.  How about that?  Beyond...  That wasn't really a threat.  No.  That's fine.  Oh!  Oh!  So you're saying it's like he just said, hey, well, then don't ever eat dog shit. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Like, I wasn't gonna.  You didn't like his DJing?  No, it was really bad for me.  It was really bad.  Are you pretty?  What makes a bad DJ, though?  Are you pretty?  Can we go on a date?  You want to go see Bruce?  I want to go to school with you tomorrow.  I actually live in Harlem.  Uh-oh.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Calm down, Anthony.  I'm going to Columbia.  She's right.  You can tell she's right.  Bring back some Coke.  Oh.  University.  I'm probably too old for you. 
[02:03:00]  I don't know that that's the case, but I don't think my boyfriend would appreciate  it.  Oh!  Thanks for nothing.  Is he from Harlem?  Hope he's not from Harlem.  Goodbye.  Jeez.  That was funny.  She didn't like Troy.  That's fine.  Here's the phone calls.  I agree with Troy.  It's the fat fuck's fault.  Hey.  I used to be fat, and Troy is right.  I went to the gym and got my ass in shape.  There you go.  Troy's problem is because Eric is comfortable in his own skin.  Troy is a closeted homosexual. 
[02:03:30]  You're gay?  Oh!  Oh.  Troy should shut the fuck up and let Eric eat himself to death.  Troy Watley.  Only diet that works is shutting your mouth.  E-Rock is full of shit.  That's true.  Troy is a jealous douche.  Troy doesn't like E-Rock for the little money he makes.  He must really hate Ope and Jim.  Oh!  Wow!  Jealous douche.  Damn it!  Which one do you want to take?  Take it.  Bring it.  Bring it.  I want to do the homosexual one.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  Do the homosexual one.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Rich in Georgia.  Well, you know, Troy, he over-machos himself.  He's got to be a closet queer.  Because what straight guy...  Of the South?  Of course.  What straight guy says, oh, I'm going to get this guy, so I'm going to go up and French kiss him?  You Frenched him?  So you don't know the customs of the North here.  Yeah, really.  Jordan?  I guess they play differently.  Mason Dixon line, it's a little different.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess that's something macho up there.  I think... 
[02:04:30]  And I know this is corny, but I think him and Fez need to get a show on how cute called DJ and the Bear.  DJ and the Bear.  Oh!  Ouch!  DJ and the Bear.  All right.  Gotcha.  He hung up.  Someone's saying that you're actually a good DJ.  That's coming in.  So, wow, you've got people that actually know you're DJ.  Opening up for Jason Ellis' band, I mean, I played 20 minutes, and it was just a warm-up for an opening act.  Where I DJ a full night, it's I'm rocking a party.  Yeah, but that chick said you sucked. 
[02:05:00]  Okay, they're good.  Is he the front man?  Yeah.  Is he outrageous?  No, he doesn't do anything real crazy.  No?  They're cool.  So it'd be like crazy Australian guy.  Whoa, look out.  No?  No.  Just go out and sing.  Yeah.  Well, I'm out on stage, and I'll start doing some music.  I'll be at Los Feliz on the Lower East Side this Saturday.  So if you want to come see me DJ, that's where I'll be.  Ah!  And then people can make their own opinion about your DJing, right?  What's your DJ name?  Troy Kwan.  Oh, that's a real...  Troy Kwan. 
[02:05:30]  People dance to it?  Do you play dance music?  Certain places, like Saturday.  Saturday would be crazy, yeah.  What do you play?  I mean, everything from Top 40 to House to Hip Hop.  Do you play The Doors?  No.  The Doors.  Yeah.  You make your living DJ, really.  I mean, I balance it with working here, too.  I have mixtapes online, if you can check them out on SoundCloud.  Troy Kwan on SoundCloud.  Troy Kwan on SoundCloud.  Nice.  What is this SoundCloud I hear?  What is that?  I don't know.  See, what's in a cloud that sings or something? 
[02:06:00]  Oh, it's very...  Partially SoundCloud-y.  No one heard my joke.  Oh, no, Chip.  We haven't.  What's in a cloud that sings or something?  Ah, now I heard it.  So, E-Rock, we're good?  SoundCloud.  You good, E-Rock?  Yeah, whatever.  Troy took a good beating there.  You must be pretty happy.  I'm fine.  He's not fine.  Why?  His voice is perfect.  Oh, yeah.  Crystal clear.  Not a gravelly tone to be found. 
[02:06:30]  No, that's true.  Smooth as silk.  He's singing a lullaby.  Velvet fog.  My favorite part is that he adds treats to his water.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Iced tea.  He loves the iced tea treat.  He loves sweets and flavors.  Little packets.  We all do.  Why drink water when you could, you know, have that nice tea?  My favorite part is that every time this comes up,  this is surprising to you.  No, it's just...  Ah, shit, yeah.  That's great.  I love when E-Rock points back.  When he's right, he's right. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, sure.  All right, I guess we'll start the radio show next then.  I have to go tape something.  What?  I'm staying.  All right.  What?  I want to go to Bruce with.  Oh, I could have gone with that girl, but she had a boyfriend.  I want to fucking have somebody get my...  I don't want to go get my tickets.  I don't either.  Someone get my Bruce tickets.  How far away are the tickets?  Had it.  Close?  I blocked.  They're at a hotel.  I'll pick them.  I got to go get my tickets today.  I'll get yours.  Why are they at a hotel?  That's weird.  I don't know.  And it's a pain in the ass. 
[02:07:30]  Language.  You go up there, you get a wristband, you get this, you get...  It was a pain in the ass.  I want to know how much the company spent on this.  Oh, my God.  Ten hundred thousand dollars.  I want to know.  I think it was a lot.  Well, the fact that they flew decorations in from the original Studio 54 for that Studio  54 event makes me think...  Yeah, which made no difference in the end.  They can use that money to take their employees.  It had the original cum on it, though.  Yeah.  See, because that place...  But now we can look back at that event. 
[02:08:00]  It made no difference whatsoever.  No.  As people continue to starve...  None.  ...with no raises in sight.  Do you think that raise money was used improperly on parties?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm trying to be better.  Jesus.  I'll write a blog.  Of course.  You got to take care of your employees first before you fly in the disco ball from the  original Studio 54.  Of course.  Anyone knows that.  That means the company doesn't give a fuck about its employees.  Of course. 
[02:08:30]  They love events.  Yeah, they love events.  Good for them.  Enjoy.  All right.  Troy, good job today.  Yeah, Troy...  It took a beating, though.  First of all...  Iraq might have won.  Here's the bottom line, though.  Troy came in because we asked him to.  And I actually think Troy's an honest guy.  Comes in here and, you know...  Unlike other people around here?  Yeah.  Well...  Is that what you're saying?  I'm not going to say anything.  Say something.  Well, you're listening right at me. 
[02:09:00]  Iraq rules, man.  I don't care what anyone says.  That's why we do this.  I don't care what people are saying.  That's why we do this.  We love the Iraq in the end.  Since we spent all that time with Iraq and Troy, does that mean you're not going to talk  about owing other staff members money?  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  That's true.  Fuck.  Yeah.  You notice that he's been hanging around the whole show?  He knows.  Oh, he keeps coming in here as a reminder.  You know why?  I haven't seen...  Because he pre-ordered his iPad and he needs to pay for it, so you're the guy.  I haven't seen Travis this much in years. 
[02:09:30]  He's been hanging around all day.  It's time to pay the piper.  Well, I don't know.  Let's discuss that.  Time to pay the pipe cleaner.  We'll discuss that next with you.  Oh!  Watch this.  Joe DiMaggio died 13 years ago today.  Uh-oh.  And that's your getting topical video.  Wow!  That's bringing it right back.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  That's 84.  We'll start the radio show next.  Chop, chop.  You're listening to the...  You're listening to the...  The L.P.  Anthony Channel.  A serious accent. 
[02:10:00]  What?  Everyone loves Springsteen.  And everyone loves Bobo.  Except for God, maybe.  What could be better than Bobo singing like Springsteen?  Look, sort of, Kenny.  He's tall.  He's from New Jersey.  He drives down the turnpike.  He used to be a cop.  Introducing Bobo Sings the Boss.  Improvised Springsteen songs about ordinary people from the great state of New Jersey. 
[02:10:30]  He's sorry, Dave.  He lives in Jersey.  He's got a kid.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He's from Hobo, New Jersey.  He's big.  He eats.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Could there possibly be anything less impressive?  Travis, he loves 24.  And he also has two pets. 
[02:11:00]  And his wife loves the Montreal Canadian.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  He really sucks, doesn't he?  Sam, he's driven down through the New Jersey turnpike.  But his afro is so big that he can only drive a convertible.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We get it.  You're from New Jersey.  Now shut up.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Bobo Sings the Boss will forever tarnish your treasured memories of Jersey's finest export next to refined petroleum and garbage. 
[02:11:30]  Coming to you from, uh, Masbury Park.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Bobo Sings the Boss.  Now available.  Nobody cares.  Hey, this is Billy Cornley.  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hey, this is Quinn Tarantino.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss.  Hey, this is John C. Reilly.  Hey, this is Kevin Smith.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Two dudes I could sit around and talk to for hours and have sat around and talked to for hours.  So I guess the new iPad came out yesterday. 
[02:12:00]  Or was revealed.  Revealed.  They announced it.  It's going to be out at the end of the month, I think.  Why the fuck?  They just came out with another one.  They just, fuck you.  When was two?  Eight hours ago.  Fuck.  Can't keep up with this shit.  When did two come out?  Oh.  Ooh.  Two, uh, it's got to be a couple of years now, right?  Two?  Yeah.  What are you, nuts?  Not even a year.  Really? 
[02:12:30]  I'll pop lock on you.  What are all the bells that came out a year ago?  What are all the bells and whistles with this one?  Well, it's a much sharper screen retina display.  What's that mean?  It means the screen quality is much better.  The best on any mobile device.  Mm-hmm.  Faster processor.  How big is it compared to the iPad I got now?  It's actually, uh, the same size, very slightly thicker, very slightly, but...  Well, uh, let's slow down with that same size shit. 
[02:13:00]  I'm not ready to fucking give in.  Oh, boy.  It's the same size and it works with the same cases.  If it's a little thicker, is it the same size?  It's the same size.  I'm all about semantics when it comes to losing money.  I know that.  It's also got a better camera on it.  And video capability, or did two have video capability?  Yeah, it did, but now it has 1080p video capability.  That's what I heard.  You could be making videos.  It's not 1080p on the first one?  Mm-mm.  What the fuck's the difference between what I have now in 1080p?  Oh, no, please. 
[02:13:30]  Higher resolution.  Bah, bah, bah.  He's been resolution-hating.  Porton.  Troy's, uh, Travis is coming in.  It's the exact same size.  You can use, uh, any smart cover for the iPad, too.  Are you sure?  Absolutely.  They're still selling them.  Oh.  What was the bet?  What was the bet?  Yeah, there was a bet.  He doesn't care what the bet is.  He just wants to do his new character.  I don't know.  I don't understand you people.  Did I miss a new character as I'm walking down the hall?  Yes, yes.  That's how fast things happen.  He doesn't give a fuck what the bet was. 
[02:14:00]  He doesn't give a fuck.  It's just an opportunity to do his new character.  So should I tell him what the bet was?  I want to bet.  What?  It's Stan.  Stan?  Yeah.  Stuttering Stanley?  No.  His last name is Murr.  Oh, my God.  Stan Murr.  Oh, no.  No, you didn't do that.  Eric, you don't have audio of the bet, right?  I'll bet I do. 
[02:14:30]  Fuck.  Let's hear it.  The bet was, I bet, Travis, that the new iPad would be smaller.  Because I see all this shit on the sides.  I thought they would squeeze it a little bit for me.  Now, here's what I love.  Keeping the screen the same size.  The clip that we have is about two and a half minutes.  Because it illustrates how many times people tried to get you to back out of this bet.  Really?  Yeah.  How much did it bet for?  Well, it was for $100.  Good.  Oh, $100.  Okay.  But then, someone got very confident. 
[02:15:00]  Fuck.  Oh, no.  What were you basing that on?  Why were you that confident?  I don't know.  I know this world likes to make things smaller.  But now they want to make things bigger again.  I get so confused.  I'm looking at new phones.  I'm looking at new phones and they're now bigger again.  What happened?  I thought we wanted to make them small.  They want the screen for video.  Yeah.  Because now with all the multimedia.  But didn't we like when everything was getting smaller?  So why do we go back to getting things bigger?  Well, it's actually the same size.  The iPad's the same size. 
[02:15:30]  It's a little thicker.  Is it the same size?  It's smaller and with similar functionality.  You would just get the phone.  So cutting down the size of it would be silly.  I said slightly.  Especially with the new display.  You want to show off that display, that big, nice.  So they're going to keep all this black border shit?  Or what?  You need that.  If you want a white iPhone.  A year later, I would assume you don't need that.  And that's my logic.  What are you going to hold onto the screen also?  You need a little border for your hands to hold onto.  I have to take half the border away. 
[02:16:00]  That doesn't make it smaller.  And then I would have fucking saved $200.  Well, you're just looking out for yourself now.  You want to hear the audio from yesterday?  I kind of want to hear the bet being made, yeah.  I will bet money on this.  And I swear I have no inside info.  This iPad will absolutely be smaller.  Why are you saying?  How much do you want to bet?  You don't think?  Travis wants to bet.  Why not?  Because it doesn't make any sense.  Dr. Gay!  Not significantly, but I bet you it's smaller. 
[02:16:30]  Cool.  How much do you want to bet?  You see this black border shit?  They'll get rid of that.  What?  So they'll have almost the same fucking screen.  But they need that.  Why do you need the black border shit?  Because it contains...  It's almost an inch.  But it contains things that can't be under the screen.  Yeah, but they got their shit smaller.  That's why they were putting out an iPad 3.  What's the bet?  $100.  So you're saying the screen size won't be smaller.  Oh, wait.  What do you say?  The actual iPad will be smaller.  The iPad itself will be small, but the screen will be the same size.  Either same size or close. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, man.  Because this is all wasted shit.  Now, what happens...  And I'm sure they've got technology now that can fix that.  What happens if there's two versions?  What do you mean?  If there's a regular version that's the same size, and then they also...  And a shithead version?  I will take this bet.  This iPad 3 is going to absolutely be smaller.  I'm not saying the screen, necessarily.  Okay, dick.  Because this is a lot of wasted shit.  I hear they're going to call it iPad HD.  That's what I hear, too.  That's what I hear.  Instead of 3, and keep going with the number of things.  That's wrong, wrong. 
[02:17:30]  $100 on the table.  iPad HD.  Why?  Did you look up something?  No.  There's no information.  It's not going to look up.  It's all rumor and speculation.  All right.  I'll take that bet.  All right.  Wow.  You're going to help pay for my iPad HD.  Oh, nice.  But look at this.  All my contact.  Why wouldn't the whole thing be smaller if you get rid of the black shit?  Because the black border around the iPhone or iPad contains electronics that is necessary.  And I don't think they're at the point yet that they can condense all that into the  area underneath the actual screen.  Well, what if they need that border area? 
[02:18:00]  But what if you only take a little of the border away?  I don't think it's worth...  I bet the shit got a little smaller.  I don't think it's worth the size difference.  Huh?  It's composition.  It's how it looks.  Yeah, yeah.  That's true, too.  Because all screen, when you put your thumbs on the side to pick it up...  Oh, you'd be on the screen, O.B.  You guys are confused.  It doesn't even have to be all screen.  I mean, you cut this border in half and you got a smaller unit.  But why that much smaller?  What's the big deal if it's that much smaller?  Because the other...  The competition, they're coming out with tablets a lot smaller. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, if I want a smaller tablet, I got my iPhone.  Well, no, but somewhere in between.  No, I don't like in between.  I'm going...  Because, first of all, unless it fits in your pocket, you're going to have to carry it.  Yeah, I hear that.  So, the iPad, the size it is now, is fine.  This is going to be a bit smaller.  Yeah.  But maybe the screen is the same size.  Well, that's a bold statement.  And Travis and I got a bet.  It's a bold statement.  Oh, it looks like I...  Good news.  It looks like you only bet $100.  That's not bad.  A hundred bucks or tears.  No.  It looks like I bet $100.  I'm sure Eric's got something. 
[02:19:00]  Is there another clip?  Yes, there happens to be another clip.  Fuck!  Ah.  Look, I'll give you the $100, because I lost $100.  I think...  I officially lost $100.  Here you go.  $100.  I don't know.  Unless you have proof, I bet $100.  I bet $100.  How much is the new iPad?  Same price.  How much is that?  The cheapest one is $500.  What the fuck?  No, don't.  Just make believe you didn't hear that.  Please.  I'm the regular guy buying that shit! 
[02:19:30]  Who's that?  I have no idea.  Chicken fingers?  How long is the other clip?  This one is a minute and a half.  Wait.  Is that too long?  No, we can just play 240, so you're all right.  Is there going to be a long...  Is there going to be a...  I'm not answering any of your questions.  That's...  I have a legit question.  It's how many gigs are in both versions?  Same.  Same as last time.  16, 32, and 64.  I want the 64.  I want the fucking 16.  How much is the 16? 
[02:20:00]  Oh.  That's a $7.99.  Get the fuck out of here!  Why?  You idiot.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Here's...  So I owed you $100.  That's it, I guess.  So far.  Fuck.  What do you got, Eric?  And we'll see you tomorrow if Travis wins $100.  I say this new iPad will absolutely be smaller.  I think I'm going to go with Travis on this one.  Not significantly, nothing crazy, but just enough.  Small enough.  This Black Border shit, I'm telling you.  I think since this came out, they figured that out. 
[02:20:30]  Where is that?  Oh, sorry.  And that means then...  It's always an error.  This is why they go smaller.  Because you see all these iPad covers?  Yeah.  Useless with the new iPad.  Oh, shit!  And they're all about trying to get as much money from you as possible.  So now, if you get a new iPad, right, you can't use your old iPad cover.  So now they get you for that as well.  Well, they have to really...  $200, Travis.  I'm upping my bet.  Dude, all they really have to...  Oh, man. 
[02:21:00]  There it was.  I'm upping my bet to $200 instead of the fucking Peyton Manning bet.  Fuck that.  I'm a little nervous about...  Are you really this stupid?  Okay, $200.  Yeah, because I just figured out that why wouldn't they make it small if they could so that forces  you to buy a new iPad cover?  All right, Travis.  Riley, get some new clothes.  Oh, Travis gets a new iPad.  You're going with Travis on this?  Yeah.  You think they're going to be the exact...  There's no way they're going exact size.  Yeah, I'm going with Travis, too.  I think so.  If anything, they'll make the screen bigger.  Why change the size when... 
[02:21:30]  The whole thing...  My fingers were crossed!  Oh, boy.  My fingers were crossed!  The whole thing is that it's going to have an HD display, so if anything, the display  would become bigger if they had more room for it.  Can I say that your logic is not crazy, though?  No, it's not crazy at all.  I'm listening to what you were saying.  You were...  That makes me feel good, too.  You want to go back in time and punch that opium in the face?  Yes.  Why?  What you were saying wasn't...  He's an uninformed douche.  If he went back in time, he'd bet $300.  Yeah, probably.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  So I'm saying that it is different. 
[02:22:00]  Now, look.  It's a little smaller or...  That wasn't the bet.  No, it's not smaller at all.  It's definitely not smaller.  A little bigger?  So it's not the same.  $200?  $200.  That's going to help pay for the iPad, which I'll bring in and I'll let you see what you  helped pay for.  Look, um...  Ouch.  $200.  Why the fuck you throw such money away?  Fuck, I suck at betting.  I just suck at it.  Oh, there it is.  There's the other two.  Wow.  Travis pounced on it.  Of course he did.  Look at that.  I need the money. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  I need the money.  God damn, was that a dumb bet.  How bad's your rent?  That's pretty dumb.  How bad's my rent?  Like, honestly?  What?  No!  He doesn't care!  Oh, no.  It's got to be...  Oh, no.  He doesn't care how much your rent is.  He was ready to tell him what the rent was.  Seven years, I'm still this stupid.  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  I can't believe you've been here seven years.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck are we doing with this shit?  He doesn't care. 
[02:23:00]  And you almost answered him.  I really did.  Yeah, yeah.  And if you asked me again in ten minutes, I'd probably still answer him.  Hollywood.  Fuck, I can't believe I lost that bet.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  Want a bet about Peyton Manning?  What's that Manning bet?  Where is he going?  Dolphins, right?  That's a possibility.  He went down there.  He sure did.  He also wore a Yankee jersey.  Going to the Yankees?  What does that mean?  Go to the Jets.  Go to the Yankees.  Yeah.  Do you think Jets are going to try to get him?  Yes.  What was he making at his last gig?  $250,000 a second. 
[02:23:30]  What the fuck are you making that much?  Jimmy, I was setting you up.  Yeah, what's wrong?  Even I saw that one.  I didn't.  Why the fuck do I see the obvious ones?  Why the fuck did I climb an allergy trip by the fucking bullhills?  So you think he's going to Florida?  I'm going to say Washington.  Washington.  Why the fuck would he go there?  Oh, my God. 
[02:24:00]  I'm going to do a pretty good fucking Bruce Gracie show.  He's a hit, isn't he?  Oh, he is a hit.  All right.  Does he have a name yet?  Yes.  Don't ask.  Maybe he'll forget.  All right, we're going to break.  I'm going to forget shit.  I take Jim Copeland.  We're going to catch up on breaks. 
[02:24:30]  A quick break.  Who catch up?  I get some fucking mustard.  And then, uh...  Now you're just yelling his shit.  And then we got the...  Shit material.  What's that?  And then we got the Peyton Manning audio that everyone's talking about.  Ah.  Better than Mike Schmidt?  Nothing's better than Mike Schmidt.  Yeah, it could...  From 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees.  Oh, no.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player. 
[02:25:00]  What happened?  I beg God, his dream came true.  So, isn't this great?  Not better than that, you don't think?  So?  Well, we're going to listen to Peyton Manning leaving the Colts after this quick break.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Channel.  What's that?  On Sirius XM.  We all live in a yellow...

[02:32:00]  why would he just buy it  say just leave it alone  yeah yeah  i think it was only like a couple hundred thousand dollars  because he probably wouldn't give a shit  yeah  who cares  who wants to fucking  hey this is where dj laced up his sneakers in 1983  is it  who cares  exactly  who cares  but he practices his skills in the backyard of that house  that's cool  show me where he ate jessica alba's ass  i paid just as much as a sofa  oh man  i fucking watched uh 
[02:32:30]  tinker taylor soldier  what the fuck is going on in this movie  last night  and uh  oh my god  look  a little uh  a little daunting to watch  yeah  but he said all that  when he came in  he said it's a tough story to follow  tinker soldier hat spy  taylor feet  toes  i'm like what  wait a minute  this guy  but he got nominated  oh i know  believe me  i i enjoyed the movie  i enjoy  the uh  the acting in it  i i liked it  but  yeah there's so many different people 
[02:33:00]  and they're  they're  looking for things  and and and the story is very  hard to follow  as far as  what  what  what clues they're getting for something  and why it matters  and  you're kind of like wait  why did  why did they do that  who was that guy  and why  why couldn't they make it easier to follow  i don't know  because even oldman said that it's a tough movie to follow  it's a complex uh  little story of intrigue  it reminds 
[02:33:30]  it reminded me of a mad mad mad mad world  really  yeah  did it  scavenger  cannonball run  scavenger hunt  did it make sense in the end  that's just it  i'm like okay  some of these movies  they don't make sense until the end  and then everything wraps up  comes together  and and some of it  yeah made sense at the end  like the the basic big  the big picture i got  the big picture i understood  okay  there's a  a mole in the organization  they have to find it  of course some of the twists and turns 
[02:34:00]  were  people thinking  is there an actual mole in the organization  is there not  is it a  decoy kind of a thing  to  distract them  yep  so the big picture i got  but then these little peripheral  stories of  guys on little missions  and and other characters  and what they mean  to the big picture story  i had no fucking idea  who some of these people were  yeah  tinker skippy soldier hat  hat  another hat  yeah  uh  it was good  but what happened is  they were looking through 
[02:34:30]  some mole going on  and i think the big line  of the movie was  hey who's  who's acting all  moly and shit  i missed that line  who's acting all  moly and shit  i don't think that was ever said  something's good  with alvin jimmy today  i love it  he's not willing to  oh  it's fantastic  something's good  yeah so it was uh  it was good  the act  like i said  the acting was good  and i like  i like it when  when the english 
[02:35:00]  put a movie together  like that  you know  it's very uh  classy and everything  uh  and and the look  and and music from it  was almost like  they brought it back  to like the  the those old movies  yeah  it might be the best  set design i've ever seen  as far as  yeah it was fantastic  yeah  and that amazing scene  where they're doing  some spying  and uh  you realize that  the 12 and the clock  is gone  no it wasn't  that scarlet  and you're like  i don't understand  what's happening 
[02:35:30]  in fucking  in uh  in tinker kleenex  dish hat  cup  soldier  tinker  the scene in uh  the scene in uh  bangladesh  where it was  it bangladesh  or no it was uh  where the hell were they  schenectady  schenectady  when the agent  was sitting with the guy  and he noticed the  uh  the beginning  oh yeah  that was a very  incredibly good scene  very tense  i like that  yeah  also in the uh  i was actually  in a quiet private 
[02:36:00]  screening  with like 15 other  people  and i was like  what the fuck  is the way  to do it  you didn't say that  to myself  i love how you're  trying to sell this  movie  and i'm not  watching this  that's just it  i know i'm not  watching this  i'm not trying  to sell it  that's just it  i'm kind of like  you want to say  it was good  i wanted to like  it so much  because i like  these movies  i like like spy  movies and shit  they're gonna make  another one of her  because it did  all right  yeah  what's it gonna  be called  jim  yeah  probably uh  uh tinker  jumper 
[02:36:30]  cable lamp  soldier  soldier  tootsies  soldier tinker  taylor  spy  what  straw  papers  who remembers  that name  i don't fucking  know  all right  uh take 21  here on the  set of  tinker taylor  soldier spy  jesus what  tinker taylor  tinker taylor  soldier spy  maybe that's the  first problem  of the movie  it was the  name  right the  name  well it's a  book i think  or a series  it's not like  someone's saying  that author is 
[02:37:00]  very hard to  read to begin  oh really  really it's a  hard read also  it's a hard read  and then they  make it into a  movie  yeah it's hard  to follow  tinker taylor  soldier spy  i mean i was  watching tinker  taylor soldier  spy and i was  like what is  going on in  tinker taylor  soldier spy  i bet you  you can't say  it three times  in a row  tinker taylor  soldier spy  tinker taylor  soldier spy  tinker taylor  soldier spy  in high school  i won boy  most  i won  lost another  bet though  see how bad  i am  i was the  best in my  high school  at saying  phrases repeatedly  without tripping 
[02:37:30]  yes i was  every year i got  the blue ribbon  in phrase  saying  blue ribbon  in phrase  saying  rapid phrase  saying  no just  phrase  saying  oh just  phrase  saying  like you  have to say  that's what  phrase saying  phrase saying  phrase saying  try it  that's hard  phrase saying  tinker taylor  soldier spy  i'm looping  and fucking  tuckered out  too much  fucking  bin work  i'll tell you  right now  people are  loving goon  yeah  sean william scott's  latest hockey  flick  oh goon  i saw  i liked it  i didn't think it  was gonna find an 
[02:38:00]  audience but people  are fucking uh  watching this thing  yeah tweeting all  the time about how  much they liked it  it's on demand  yes it is on demand  and then they're gonna  try to throw it in  theaters for a little  while  march 30th but  so far so good  with our audience  they like goon  a lot of blood  a lot of violence  a lot of hockey  fights  hockey  while you were  watching that i was  watching um  linsanity become a  complete bust  it's over  we all knew that was  gonna happen  it's over now  well cause he's being 
[02:38:30]  too polite cause  carmelo anthony's the  big star of the knicks  he the whole reason  linsanity took off was  cause carmelo anthony  went out with a groin  injury and allowed  uh jeremy lind to  fucking shine  lins gotta kick him  in the bulls  now he's back  and you gotta  you gotta give this  idiot the fucking  ball he needs his  shots  yeah  a lot of people say  uh that carmelo anthony  uh scores a lot of  empty points  what's that  scores a lot but it  means nothing in the  end  really what does that  mean  if you score a lot  isn't that good  well not if you're  winning games 
[02:39:00]  i don't watch  basketball  i think they're like  two and five since  uh carmelo came back  i like to watch  the football  but another loss  for the knicks  uh last night  and uh people  aren't hashtagging  linsanity as much  nah he's a  he's a bust  i'm so happy  it's not that he's  a bust but  his skills have  come down to  fucking earth a bit  of course they have  two weeks in the  limelight and he's  fucking running  around causing  everybody's baskets 
[02:39:30]  to get it up for  fucking tinker  lins seller  fucking carmelo  whatever's happening  can we move that  second hand to ten  please  please just move  it right to  oh we got plenty  of time  36 minutes  holy fuck  36 minutes  what are we gonna  say  is the problem  with the knicks  carmelo anthony  or jeremy lynn  not being timid  around him  that might be  that's a good  question  well carmelo anthony  ball hawk  well a lot of  people think he's  a ball hawk  to begin with  but he's the 
[02:40:00]  star of the  fucking team  and he needs  his looks  yeah  but why jeremy lynn  won't step up  and say  probably  stand the fuck  down  step up yo  i think it's the  coach's fault  i think the coach  has to figure it  all out  yeah it sucks  probably uh  it's a completely  different team  with carmelo anthony  back in the lineup  does he have a  contract  lynn  yeah  because he probably  wants to be doing  well when he  renegotiates  nah he'll  yeah  i don't know  where he's at  with that  he's got a  basic contract  sure  what do they  make at that  level  he makes about 
[02:40:30]  57,000 a year  i thought it'd be  more  pretty sure it is  what  there's gotta be  more than that  no 57,000 is the  minimum  is it  come out  anthony  fucking ball  yeah  he started  you win  so then the  coach needs to  tell  jeremy lynn  that he's  got to be  the star  that's who  you need  coach ken  howard  from white  shadow  go to 
[02:41:00]  crankalicious  dot hub pages  dot com  right now  somebody might  be giving my  fucking money  back  oh stop  crankalicious  dot hub  thank you eric  wilkinson  if i get my  money back  i'm giving  you half  is this  right  crankalicious  dot hub  pages  dot com  he says  ipad  3 looks  exactly like  the ipad  2  however  oh  ready for  the however  yes  when measured  the ipad  3 is 
[02:41:30]  one  millimeter  thinner  thinner  he said  thinner  he acknowledged  thinner  i said  smaller  smaller  thinner  same thing  you would  stick by  that  oh  you got  it  because  it's  supposed  to  be  thicker  the ipad  3 is  supposed  to be  thicker  but if it's  thinner 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, I think this guy's throwing a bunch of fudge around town.  It's got to be thinner.  I think it's thick air.  Thick air.  Yeah, come on.  Stop.  Word is gone.  I don't see this.  Yeah, this guy's lying.  I think somebody wanted a little plug for their website.  It's a red herring.  Oh, really?  A red herring?  Fuck.  Yes, a red herring.  What is a red herring?  We'll call it a regular herring.  I know.  Calls a herring.  Yeah.  I'm a member of the...  I'm just talking about it.  I was going to say I'm a member of the Green Herring Society. 
[02:42:30]  Society?  Why is it you're mean, you idiot?  Green herrings.  Okay, wait.  I found the story.  Oh, oh, oh.  Thinner.  Thinner.  Thinner.  For all intents and purposes, the iPad 3 looks exactly like the iPad 2.  However, when measured, the iPad 3 is one millimeter thinner.  Oh, fuck.  Give me my money back.  It is also 2.5 ounces lighter.  According to documents found on the iPad 3 itself, the tablet will come in six colors. 
[02:43:00]  Why is Travis hiding?  That makes it smaller.  No, no, no.  Ant, I know he's your pal.  Wait, wait, wait.  Got to be fair here.  What, what, what?  This says, my iPad 3 prototype was left behind by an Apple employee at a Starbucks near Cupertino.  I don't, I don't know.  Oh, and that's where he got the info.  I don't know if you could, number one, if it's a prototype, it's not the final product. 
[02:43:30]  Right, you need to bring that motherfucker in and just wait.  Well, wait, I'll hold one in each hand.  Travis?  Not true.  Fuck!  Why is it not true?  We're reading it.  I don't, I don't know who runs crankalicious.hubpages.com.  All right, maybe I'm stretching a little bit.  But it's, but it's slightly thicker.  It's deeper.  Yes, it's deeper.  It's girthier.  Yes, girthier.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah, it's girthy cock.  Yeah, so you actually owe him another 50 bucks. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, I think that's fair.  How is that?  Because you tried to welch on the bet and re-nake.  Yeah, it's a $50 penalty.  Yep.  Fuck.  Yeah, it's...  It's 9.4 millimeters deep.  This, according to GoogleChat.TravisTest.  It's 9.4 millimeters deep.  A bit thicker.  Girthier.  Than the iPad 2.  Who gives a turkey?  So that's 50 to you.  I don't give a care.  9.4 millimeters.  As I said yesterday, I will be buying Danny a Whopper Jr. and Sam some chicken nuggets 
[02:44:30]  from Burger King.  Woo, woo.  Wow.  What do you buy in A-Rock?  He's got it.  Well, Eric wasn't here yesterday to talk about it.  Oh, fuck.  What kind of lunch do you want, A-Rock?  Travis is treating you for lunch.  Plus, he'll take all the money.  And how about Weight Watchers?  What the fuck?  He can't be eating that shit.  Yeah, what do you got that's fucking a couple points?  What are you eating for points?  I don't know.  I have to figure it out.  Oh, wait.  Oh, today's Thursday.  Shit.  Bullets don't have any.  No.  I don't know what to guess. 
[02:45:00]  Terrible suggestion.  How long do you think A-Rock's going to last on the Weight Watchers diet?  I don't know.  It's not the time of the day.  It'll be over before you get back from vacation.  I would assume it's already over since we brought it up this morning.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I'm still logging.  What are you thinking for lunch?  What are you thinking for having lunch?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Have a hoagie.  How many choices?  Paper.  I made...  I made...  You know, because it's fat-free.  It's not done.  It'll probably be all carbs.  Terrible. 
[02:45:30]  Tree buck.  Eric said before that he wouldn't...  He wasn't doing Weight Watchers because he didn't want to log in every food that he eats.  However, he's on...  Overload the computer.  He'd be the first person to realize an iPhone has a character limit.  Like, you've entered too many letters, the phone has to break down.  He's on a social network where he logs in every TV show that he watches, which he keeps up with.  Right, I heard about that on the shit show, yeah.  It's Get Glue. 
[02:46:00]  Why do you do that?  Get Glue?  Yeah, why do you do that?  Ew!  Does he get free stickers?  I'm on Get Glue.  What the fuck is free stickers?  12?  What douchebags?  Can you be a mayor of something on Get Glue?  No.  It should be Get Glue.  But if you check in...  Come, Guzzler.  If you check in while the show is live...  He gets to the glue factory.  I know.  He's a horse.  Oh, it's funny.  If you check in while the show is on live, some shows...  Get Glue for all the pants you've ripped up to that. 
[02:46:30]  Sorry, Sam.  No, no, no.  It's not, you know.  I said that about Eric, so that's fair.  Yeah.  Some shows, if you check in live, will give you stickers.  Um, and that includes Raw and SmackDown.  So I get different...  Oh!  I get different wrestler stickers.  Like real stickers?  Like they mail them to you?  If you get 20, they'll mail you a sticker sheet.  Who cares?  How do they carve it?  I don't know, but I also got...  The networks buy into it.  I'd like to fucking lay his sticker sheet down in the street, and then drive over it,  and slam on the brakes, and skid on the top.  Put a bunch of holes in them. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, just drag it with my fucking truck, and then just gravel.  I got a...  It's stupid.  I got a rare one, because I checked into Celebrity Wife Swap, and that got me a Mick Foley sticker.  You actually do this?  Why would you do this?  Stick them on your old sneakers and burn them.  Fucking dumb stickers.  Yeah.  I'll log in, and you guys can see my stickers.  Just buy them off eBay, you fucking queer.  Why is it called get...  Oh, because stickers are glue?  I guess.  Oh, get glue.  So you're getting the stickers, because they stick, stick like glue.  Oh, that's terrible. 
[02:47:30]  Right?  How about just get stickers?  Yeah.  How about get stickers?  Not all the shows have stickers.  How about get AIDS?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, 25 stickers.  I could order them.  What?  Exactly.  It's fucking easier.  Oh, shit.  Logging in like a dick.  See, I got that 30 Rock one.  I got the United States Championship.  So they give you the opportunity to advertise for them by slapping...  Chris Jericho.  What do you do with the stickers?  Put them on your notebook?  Whatever you want.  That's a cool fucking 30 Rock sticker.  Yuck.  You don't like this?  It's awful.  Look at the Beth Phoenix sticker.  It's fucking horrid. 
[02:48:00]  I don't get it.  I got Daniel Bryan and CM Punk stickers.  Good for you.  At one time, they had one of you for Bored to Death.  Oh, I wish I had gotten that one.  Now Jimmy's interested.  Give me that ass.  I want to be a sticker board.  I got a 90210 sticker.  Why?  Oh, great.  What do you have to do to get these stickers?  Check in while the show's on live.  What do you mean check in?  You go on your phone and it says, like, you click Get Glue.  Is it an app?  What are you watching?  Yeah, it's an app.  And then you click whatever show you're watching. 
[02:48:30]  How much would it cost to buy all the stickers, though?  No, you can't buy the stickers.  You said you could order them.  No, no, no.  You go and you...  If I'm trying to watch, I want more stickers.  You order...  Once you've got 20 stickers, you give them your address so they can mail them to you.  They mail you a fuck.  The Unabomber sends you a package.  Do you have to pay for postage?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  Oh, boy.  I hope you have to pay for postage.  Yeah, me too.  I certainly hope so.  400 bucks.  I certainly hope so.  You can check in to listen to the Opie and Anthony show if you want.  Yeah, but there's no fucking stickers. 
[02:49:00]  I'm not doing that.  Come on, Get Glue, bitch.  I'm not going to promote you guys if you're not going to give me a sticker.  How do we get them to make a sticker for us?  This is completely...  You know how much spam you probably get because of this?  Yeah, a lot.  Because they're getting your viewing habits.  That's all database shit.  And now they have my home address.  Good.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The stickers are on the way.  Tell everyone.  No, I'm not going to tell anyone.  That's the difference.  I don't...  It's like a really dumb app.  Yeah.  Oh, you don't like it?  It's stupid.  That's because you don't like the face.  No, that's it. 
[02:49:30]  The dumb hair.  Not Sam.  What is that caricature of you?  It was done by a great artist named Zole.  I like it.  What an ass, Zole.  Thank you very much, Travis.  I think he's a very good artist.  He's a very good artist.  Is he really?  Yeah.  And he made a thing for Zack Ryder as well.  Oh.  Woo, woo, woo, you know it.  Oh.  Oh.  It's terrible.  How about that?  Just sick of it.  Thrilled.  People like them on their t-shirts, apparently.  Dumb afro.  And...  And E-Rock is into this, too, huh? 
[02:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  Me and E-Rock are going to trade stickers once I get by.  And what do you do with the stickers?  Do you collect them and save them, or do you actually stick them on things around the house?  I'm not going to stick them on anything, because I only have one of each, so I'm not going to waste them.  Jimmy's just sitting there giggling, ripping farts, just ripping.  E-Rock, are you going to put your stickers on everything?  No, I'm saving the limited edition special Simpsons stickers.  Limited to what?  Exactly.  The 500th episode, Comic-Con specialties.  Oh, fuck it.  It's a thing, and it's a limited time.  Like, one time I was like, oh, shit, I forgot to check in, and the pay-per-view elimination 
[02:50:30]  chamber was over, and I couldn't get the Seamus sticker.  You check in once, and they give you a sticker.  Yeah, for that show.  So you check in to fucking ten shows in one night, and you'll get ten stickers?  If the shows are all sticker-sponsored.  This is like a retard, does this?  It is retarded.  This is like a child's thing.  Says the guy who doesn't have a Chris Jericho sticker.  Okay.  Ah, well, he does have a point there.  I'll just ask Chris when I see him.  Give me a sticker.  He doesn't have them on him. 
[02:51:00]  He does.  He probably carries them.  Well, you don't know Kane.  Kane's a fan of mine.  He is?  I don't know.  Probably.  This is dumb.  Yeah.  It sounds like you're trading pogs.  Look at this sticker.  What does this sticker say?  Kill yourself, Sam.  No.  Check in pro.  That's right.  And what does that mean?  It says you're getting good at this.  That means I'm a professional checker-inner.  And there's a fucking hat next to it.  It's a green hat.  It says fan on it.  If you check in a certain number of times, you get extra stickers.  See?  And that means I've checked in from my iPad. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, those are...  That means I checked in on Mardi Gras.  Those are all the ones you have?  Those are all mine.  Oh, so you can see the ones you have.  There's my Mick Foley celebrity wife.  Those are literally the worst stickers I've ever seen.  Yeah, they're terrible.  In my whole entire life, I've never seen such valueless stickers.  American Idol audition stickers?  That, they're...  What a non-collectible item that is.  You don't think so?  It's abysmal.  I'd rather play Farmville.  The fucking bald guy on 30 Rock sticker? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's great.  That would be terrible.  I was kind of hoping for either Judah or Tiffany Faye.  Oh, maybe...  Tiffany Faye?  Tiffany Faye.  Oh, Tina Faye.  What the fuck?  Tiffany Faye?  I'm sorry.  Adam Walsh.  Oh, you stink.  Adam Walsh.  I'm going to fucking say Alice Rod and I'm just annoyed for $19.  You can't help it.  Look at all these Get Glue stickers on eBay.  Oh, what?  Come on now.  How much did they sell them for?  Ten bucks he wants for those he wants...  Go to completed listings. 
[02:52:30]  Let's see if any of these are sold.  Completed.  That's a good one.  There ain't no fucking way.  Look at that.  $16.49 for the Game of Thrones Get Glue sticker.  Out of print.  Ah, mister.  Oh, these are not collectible.  Yeah, but you're not going to sell these.  No.  You're going to have these until you die.  And look at this.  Simpsons TV Series Comic Con sticker that Eric was talking about can go as high as $4.99.  Wow.  That's right.  Oof.  I just picture these stuck all over the walls of the Nagel Mansion.  Mrs. Nagel just getting so pissed off that her little boy puts stickers on everything. 
[02:53:00]  On the TV set.  Where do you put your stickers?  She tries to put them over the fridge so he can't open it.  She's mad for another reason right now.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Why is she mad?  You didn't step on her foot, did you?  Much like Jimmy...  Really?  What happened?  The little woman.  What's she mad at?  Much like Jimmy started the show off today.  I brought some stuff out of storage.  Oh.  And she is none too happy.  What did you bring out of storage?  Um...  Well, I have these...  I'm sorry. 
[02:53:30]  You're good.  I'll wait.  I apologize.  I'm scared.  What did you bring out of storage?  I have these bins of all the old video game systems I've had since the late 70s.  Oh, no.  Wait, wait.  You have like fucking old school...  Old...  Nintendo and Atari.  Atari and television.  Coleco.  Commodore.  That's cool.  That's kind of...  Those are kind of collectible, though.  It's all the originals.  Are you going to display them around the house?  No.  What are you taking them out for?  Because I had to take them out of the storage thing.  So now they're in the house. 
[02:54:00]  So I just got to figure out what to do with them.  So what did she say?  Hey, piggy boy, piggy boy.  What are these doing?  She calls you piggy boy?  No, she doesn't.  But she just looked at it and she goes, what are we doing with all this shit?  How many do you have?  There's got to be eight to ten systems.  Oh, there's probably a little sauce on all the fucking joysticks.  And my old toys and...  Ew.  Like my Castle Grayskull.  Compared to his new toys.  Your Castle Grayskull?  And Snake Mountain.  I'm jealous of the Castle Grayskull. 
[02:54:30]  How much is it worth?  I don't know what it's worth now.  Why don't we look at how much your fucking ColecoVision is worth?  An original Atari.  Let's see how much that's worth.  I'm going to guess fucking $11.  That's pretty sweet.  It can't be all that much.  It's probably a good amount, though.  Remember Space Invaders?  I have it.  Oh, I loved Space Invaders.  I like the arcade, though.  They tried to port it into the home thing, but at the time it was really bad.  The graphics stunk and gameplay was awful. 
[02:55:00]  What do you got, Eric?  Now you get all those games.  I hate Astros with a joystick.  Atari 2600, 5200, and I think there's a 7200.  You know what color it is?  It was back in that time where they made everything look like wood furniture.  Wood grain.  Yeah.  Okay, so you have the least...  You have the cheapest one.  I'm sorry about that.  I just remember those.  It was $40.  $40.  $40.  Yeah.  I remember the smell of those when they were new.  Those were so cool.  And the big video...  That was... 
[02:55:30]  The cartridge that we're going...  Yeah.  Big pop-in.  Yeah.  And sometimes you'd have to...  Blow in there.  The contacts would get dirty.  You'd have to get your little ticket in the aisles of Sears or Toys R Us and take it to the cage.  Oh, yeah.  You had to take the ticket to the fucking cage.  And then they would give you the game or the gaming console.  Yeah, I remember that shit.  Oh, good gum.  Whoa.  Vintage 1989 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sewer lair playset.  I call this the greatest playset of all time. 
[02:56:00]  Really rare.  Is it?  I think it's the greatest playset ever.  How much is it?  Ghostbusters Firehouse is better.  Oh, yeah.  I still have mine.  Yeah, so do I.  How much is it?  Are you kidding?  You still have it?  I saved all of my toys for my kids, but I don't think Riley's going to want...  No, probably not.  No, I don't think so.  How much is it?  And I'm sure Lisa doesn't want Riley playing with your old piece of shit toys.  What, my He-Man?  Get her new toys.  I used to color blood on them.  You know what?  Is that when you were whipping your sock up with your cock? 
[02:56:30]  That would be the same time frame, yeah.  These Firehouses are going for like $90.  Wow.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  The only problem is the radiator melted one of the doors on my firehouse.  How ironic.  I'm pretty pissed off about that.  I bet.  You're mad to this day, I'm sure.  Yeah, I'm not.  I completely misshaped it.  Wow.  I got Ecto-1 for Christmas one time, but it was the Play-Doh version. 
[02:57:00]  And I remember asking my mom, Mom, how come Santa Claus didn't bring me the regular Ecto-1?  Uh-oh.  And my mom looked at me, and my mom looked at me as a little kid, and she said, well, maybe  Santa Claus thought that version would be good enough.  Oh, man.  In hindsight, I know that that hurt her.  Hey, I remember something like that.  When I was a kid, I was getting a G.I.  Joe helicopter.  I wanted it so bad.  G.I.  Joe helicopter.  And I'm talking full-size G.I.  Joes, not the little shitty ones from the 80s. 
[02:57:30]  And I open up the present for Christmas, and I see helicopter G.I.  Joe.  I'm like, fuck, this is crap.  I'm freaking out.  And then I looked at it, and it wasn't the right one.  It was just one that didn't have a motor on it or anything.  It didn't do anything.  It just didn't look cool.  It was big, plasticky things.  It was a piece of shit.  It was a piece of fucking shit.  I wanted the one that you press the button, and the rotors actually spun and everything.  This, you ought to sit there and spin it with your hand. 
[02:58:00]  Yay!  Sucked!  How much?  I don't know.  No, did you complain?  No, no.  I actually, I was like, this is great, this is great.  When I realized it wasn't great, I just went into my room and started crying.  Did you?  Yeah.  I started crying.  Because, first of all, because I didn't like the gift.  Secondly, I started crying because I felt bad that I didn't like the gift.  And I was, I felt like, I felt bad because, you know, I knew, you know, parents were the  ones that got the privilege. 
[02:58:30]  I want to go back in time and see you as a kid and rape you.  Oh, it was terrible.  You want to rape me?  Maybe it'll fucking help my psychological, uh, my, my, the rest of my life.  We got to go backwards.  Backwards.  Now, Iraq was sick yesterday, right?  Oh, poor guy.  Oh, man.  Iraq's just kind of like, what?  Well, he wasn't sick.  Well, edible genius writes, you caught Iraq.  He said he was unpacking game systems yesterday when he was supposed to be sick.  Oh, never said yesterday.  Back away. 
[02:59:00]  This guy is Columbo.  I know this much.  When I'm sick, I don't want to do shit.  No, that's right.  Iraq.  I just want to lay around and watch bad TV.  And he was asked what the fuck about what he did.  He said he was sleeping all day.  Yep.  Iraq, comment.  Piggy boy, piggy boy.  I'm looking for it.  I never said yesterday.  Oh, boy.  You never said yesterday, but you meant yesterday, didn't you?  No, I said stuff came out of storage.  Wait.  Did you do it yesterday or not?  No.  I didn't open anything yesterday.  Oh, no.  Except for...  It's always there. 
[02:59:30]  It's just always there.  I didn't say it.  No.  No.  I do love it.  Do you get upset when Jim calls you piggy boy, piggy boy?  You say it in a different way.  See, piggy boy, piggy boy, why have you...  When Jim called you piggy boy, piggy boy, do you get annoyed?  That's his pet name for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's always with another question.  Piggy boy, piggy boy, why have you missed work?  Piggy boy. 
[03:00:00]  He was sick.  Aw.  He was sick.  Yeah, that sort of throat.  Aw, stout.  I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  I don't mean balls.  Oh.  That wasn't very nice at all.  No more Iraq jokes for a week.  I apologize.  That's not true.  I won't do them for a week.  No, that's bullshit.  Is someone getting my tickets?  We all will.  What about mine? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, we're going to get yours, too.  Oh, goody.  You can have them tomorrow.  Are we sitting together?  Goody, goody gumdrops.  Are we sitting together?  I hope so.  I don't want to be in that Apollo theater without some fucking backup.  Let's fight.  Yeah.  We'll find out.  I think it'll be another white audience at the Apollo.  For Springsteen?  Yeah.  Yeah.  McCartney's going to seem like a fucking four-top show compared to Springsteen.  Yeah, because when we went to McCartney, we noticed, like, wow, I bet this is the  whitest audience ever to be at an Apollo show, and Springsteen's really going to be  pretty pale. 
[03:01:00]  We're going to run!  By the way, there's a guy who's cleaning the bathroom today who looks like Joseph Coney.  He's giving me the creeps, fucking warlords.  Maybe it is.  Maybe he's hiding out, because now he's being made famous by Coney 2012.  Yeah.  I watched it yesterday, because it's just all over the fucking place, and I guess you  should see what's going on.  So, I watched it.  It seems pretty, you know, pretty bad, this guy.  He has some kind of an army out there in Central Africa. 
[03:01:30]  Not so much Uganda anymore, by the way.  Wow.  I found that out.  And then he recruits these kids by just going into villages and stealing them, and then they  go around and wreak havoc on people that are against their cause, which he wants the place  to be, the country to be like, follow the Ten Commandments.  That's his whole deal.  Wow.  He wants the government based on that.  And then the president of Uganda has been fighting this guy for years, since like 1986. 
[03:02:00]  66, and...  They can't take him out?  No, that's just it.  Is that powerful?  But it's also, you take him out, there's just more people behind him.  Sure.  He's got, like, that whole army of his.  But then, what they're doing is, what this organization is doing, they want to raise money  and awareness of this Coney guy.  Right.  So that he can be caught.  But I don't see how that would work if he's in the jungles of the Congo. 
[03:02:30]  Mm-hmm.  Um, and the Sudan.  That's what we're supposed to do.  Like, how we're supposed to get him.  But then Obama sent some advisors over to help out the Ugandan army, which, by the way,  has done horrific atrocities to the same people and children that Joseph Coney performed  his atrocities on.  The Ugandan army, under the same president, by the way, he's been in there since 86. 
[03:03:00]  You studied this shit.  Oh, yeah.  He's done horrid, torturous, murderous war crimes against the same people.  But for some reason, they're kind of on his side, backing that government's army with  money and resources under the guise of catching this Joseph Coney.  But you're getting in bed with another really horrid guy in order to do it that is responsible  for his own war crimes.  So both choices suck.  Yeah.  So what do we do? 
[03:03:30]  I don't know.  Give money?  You know what you do?  You look at a map and look at Africa and go, this place has been fucked.  Fucked forever.  And say, thank God I was born in America.  Exactly.  And then just let them sort it out amongst themselves.  It's horrid.  People are dying.  But, you know, what happened to Darfur?  Is that all taken care of?  Is the Darfur cause all fucking taken care of now?  Yeah.  That's all nice, yes.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  I'm glad that's been settled because now the latest thing is these invisible children, 
[03:04:00]  as they call them.  The invisible children.  Well, they're not trending today, so I think it's all taken care of.  Is it taken care of?  Yeah.  If it's not trending on Twitter, everything's good.  By the way, the financials say that only 33% of the money that's raised for this organization  actually gets used for the purpose.  The rest goes into...  Isn't that most charities?  No.  Actually, they...  I've heard some horrific things about charities we all know.  That's why you have to look into the charities and see how much money is going to it. 
[03:04:30]  Nonprofit shit?  People get paid a lot of money to a non-profit.  And the guy that's doing the documentary, there's part of the budget actually goes to  filmmaking.  So he's buying cameras and all their transportation is paid for through these things because he's  winging back and forth to Africa.  They got these vans.  It just seems like a lot of the money isn't going to where they want it, you know.  So why is everyone talking about it on Twitter?  What are we supposed to do?  Because it seems like this real cool...  The way it's presented in the video, it's, hey, we can make a difference. 
[03:05:00]  We are changing the world because we can now unite through social media.  Right.  So help us do this.  And people get like, yeah, I want to be part of something.  It's like the Occupy Wall Street kind of mentality, you know.  I'm not saying it's not a justified cause where, you know, you don't want children getting  their faces hacked off and kidnapped in the middle of the night to go fight in some war.  But you really got to kind of look at the whole picture. 
[03:05:30]  They're not...  This video that was put out by the documentary guy, what's his name?  Jeffrey or some shit, I don't know.  But he kind of got a little piece of what's going on without the bigger picture and didn't  really explain what the war is about and who the sides are and what they practice.  It's pretty much, hey, this is what's happening.  We need you to help us.  And shouldn't we just make believe it's not happening?  It seems easier.  That's what we've done with Africa for many years. 
[03:06:00]  But every so often you get, you know, apartheid, huge cause.  Then you got the blood diamond thing, Sierra Leone.  Then you get Darfur.  You get Somalia for a while.  We always kind of perk up until something happens and then everybody forgets.  And the same thing happens.  The warlords and their machetes get to work.  And until somebody notices and says something, it is forgotten.  It's just a...  You can't fix...  You can't fix Africa.  It can't be fixed. 
[03:06:30]  What happened to you, Jimmy?  That continent's busted.  I'm sorry.  Jimmy's just talking.  Jimmy's sleepy boy.  Jimmy's sleepy boy.  No, I'm going to actually listen in.  I'm going to go, hmm, because he made a point about Africa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sleepy boy.  Well, it'll go away.  But, yeah, I think this will go away.  But on Twitter, it's just been everywhere.  They're attaching celebrity tweet names to these things to try to get their support.  Elijah Wood was actually somebody who tweeted the link and then later on tweeted like, hey, people, maybe you should look into the whole story and see what this is about. 
[03:07:00]  Because when you look at the other side, which isn't a, hey, I'm for children being kidnapped and put into war.  Hey!  There is another side to this, which is watch what you're doing and watch who you're giving money to and what it's perpetuating on that side.  Sure. 
[03:07:30]  Because the Ugandan army is not really known for being nice and the government over there has been corrupt for many years.  And this president just keeps winning overwhelming elections.  How does that happen?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not really buying that.  So, I don't know.  Do what you want.  But don't just keep tweeting that blindly about it.  What amazes me, too, I watched this video, this Coney 2012 video this guy put together, something like 12 million views on it. 
[03:08:00]  I'm like, all right.  So, then I went to every other resource for this situation and Uganda and the president of Uganda and Joseph Coney that was apart from this video.  And most of them had a couple of hundred views, which means the majority of the people watching this video are not then doing their own research  and checking out other sources for information.  Well, no one does that, though, unfortunately.  But you should.  Of course you should.  That's the whole thing. 
[03:08:30]  Of course.  That's the whole name of the game with using the Internet for education.  This should pique your interest and then you should dig deeper.  Dig deep, motherfucker.  But no one does that in the end.  Well, you always get sidetracked on porn, and I understand this.  But they're all going to just check out the main video and that's it.  Yeah, and then, you know, oh, we've got a cause.  And assume a lot of truths.  Yes, yes.  All right.  Yes, yes.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  I am all for that.  It's going to be like 70 today in New York.  Ooh.  70. 
[03:09:00]  Look, I can't say anything.  I've been in that boat.  Aw.  I just ran out of gas.  Too much shouting.  I wish you'd run out of gas.  This place stinks.  Far cut being horrendous today.  Did you get any?  I don't think someone got Weight Watchers anymore.  Oh, right.  Because that's not Weight Watchers part.  It is.  That's horrendous.  That's my body pushing out calories.  Oh, thanks, Kenny.  I have to announce this.  Yes. 
[03:09:30]  Tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.  My tickets for Foxwoods June 9th with myself, Nick DiPaolo, David Tell, and Artie Lang go on sale.  Sell 10 a.m. tomorrow, and March 15 through 17, Orlando, and then March 29 through April 1, Caroline.  Those are actually selling really well.  Yeah, of course.  They'll sell out.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  All right.  Tomorrow is, what's tomorrow?  Friday.  Friday. 
[03:10:00]  Friday.  Friday.  See you tomorrow.  Oh.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  And on Friday.  Bye-bye.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  We're going to get down on Friday, Friday.  Getting down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  Partying, partying, partying, partying, partying.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  Looking forward to the weekend.  I'm Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:10:30]  Serious XR.  Serious XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Jim's stuff is still getting cleaned up off the floor.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Yes, the monitor.  If you weren't listening in the first hour,  the monitor that Jim brought in to see if anybody wanted,  and then when he realized it was from 2003 
[03:11:00]  and nobody had technology anymore  that would keep up with that monitor,  can't plug into anything,  he literally chucked it over his shoulder  and onto the floor.  The interns are just picking that up now.  Of course, Eric, the intern,  who, as we've discussed here  on After Opie and Anthony Live,  is not the sharpest intern we've ever had,  not by a long shot.  I do like him, though.  He's not a bad guy.  I don't know.  I mean, Mark Cuban is the name you gave him. 
[03:11:30]  I don't know much about that guy.  But Eric is like a good guy.  I mean, me and E-Rock  were having this conversation earlier.  Intern Eric is a good guy.  He's just not the sharpest intern we've ever had.  He walked in,  and I guess he was trying to make conversation.  I don't know exactly what he was doing,  but Eric and I were talking.  E-Rock and I were talking.  I'll say that to separate, you know,  intern Eric from E-Rock.  Two different people.  So, E-Rock and I were talking,  and intern Eric just sees all of Jim's stuff  that he pulled out of storage today  on the floor still, 
[03:12:00]  and goes,  huh, a lot of boxes in here.  Just like, who says that other than a dumb guy?  Like, that's a dumb guy thing to say.  It's a very,  very Jeff Spicoli type thing to say,  and in 2012,  when you live,  you know,  when you're working in Manhattan,  I don't know where the Jeff Spicoli vibe  would come from,  except  if you're kind of a dull guy.  You know what I mean?  Like,  it's just not the smartest dude.  Like,  Roland,  you like,  you like the kid.  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  But you wouldn't say he's a genius.  No.  No,  not by any stretch of the imagination.  Are you,  did you get lost walking around?  Hey man.  What's up, man?  Just saw some boxes.  Some stuff on the ground,  and I'm like,  hey man,  let's party.  No, man.  I,  I,  I,  I couldn't,  I couldn't find the bin.  You hear it, Eric.  E-Rock,  you hear it.  What,  what are you hearing?  No,  I don't know, dude.  I don't know, man.  Well,  no,  I was looking for the bin. 
[03:13:00]  It was amongst the pile of boxes, man.  I couldn't find it.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, dude.  Hey, bro.  And I was like,  hey,  why don't you have the guy,  guys from the morning mashup  pick up the stuff,  and you were like,  those guys are fads.  Right?  What,  Spicoli?  I can fix this.  My dad has an excellent set of tools.  Bill and Ted?  No.  I don't know which,  what we're in reference to.  No,  that's not what it is at all.  It's nothing to do with any movies.  Oh, okay.  So yeah,  you were surprised when you saw, 
[03:13:30]  Abraham Lincoln.  Yeah.  I,  well,  I couldn't find the bin.  So great!  You're surprised.  He's killing me,  man.  When you saw,  and you know,  Eric and I,  E-Rock and I were talking.  San Dimas.  And you just,  you just looked,  and you were like,  man,  those are a lot of boxes over there.  I,  I did not sit behind the bin.  How were your grades in school?  My grades are excellent.  Like,  reaching waters.  So,  when you were in class,  did you consider that the teacher's time? 
[03:14:00]  Or was that both,  was that both of your time?  That was both of our time.  So technically,  if you were there,  and he was there,  Yeah.  you would consider it our time.  That's our time.  Yeah,  I understand.  I was like,  no.  He used to yell at the teachers going,  hey bud,  what's your problem?  Right.  You ripped my card.  Did anybody ever rip your card?  No.  No.  No.  Didn't happen.  I mean,  but the thing is though,  you have to understand that when you walk into your internship,  Yes.  and your first day,  you're wearing a button down, 
[03:14:30]  opened with nothing under it,  and a bagel shoved into your pants,  you have to realize people are going to assume certain things about your attitude.  You know what I mean?  I set myself up.  Do you know where this comes from?  No, I have no idea where you're talking about.  I don't know.  I have no idea where you're talking about.  Why don't we examine that sentence?  I don't know.  What?  I don't know.  I mean,  I have no idea what this is in reference to.  Exactly.  I have no idea.  That's not a huge surprise.  No.  It's obviously a movie or a character. 
[03:15:00]  Have you been,  have you been in the past described as not being like,  a hundred percent sharp or on the ball on certain things?  No,  I actually am.  I'm usually just burnt out by this time.  Eric.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  I mean,  10 o'clock in the morning.  Really is the time of day.  Well,  I wake up at four,  you know?  Yeah.  None of us can relate.  None of us can relate.  Especially not me.  But I got out of class at nine at night.  So I got out of class at nine at night.  Wow.  At night.  Yeah.  Are you having an excellent day?  Yes.  I'm having a fantastic day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get it.  I get it.  Bill and Ted.  Nope. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Wild stoutings.  I get it.  You got it?  Yeah,  I got it.  What's that by UCB Fred?  What is this sound?  He must be so wasted.  That's my skull.  That's some good improv.  Yeah.  That's UCB Fred.  Yes,  I know.  UCB Fred I can count on.  I'm aware.  You know what I mean?  Not that I can't count on you,  Eric.  No,  you can't.  Absolutely.  I'm not saying you're a bad intern by any stretch of the imagination.  No,  I don't think you are.  Thank you. 
[03:16:00]  And I don't think you're a bad guy either.  Thank you.  In fact,  I think you're a good guy.  Absolutely.  I just don't think you're the sharpest guy we've ever had in here.  That's all I'm saying.  Listen,  I'm not a retard.  No,  I didn't think you're.  I'm not.  No one said that.  No,  I know.  Were you ever picked on this skull?  I don't want to be portrayed that way,  and I may come off that way,  but I just,  you know,  I get very,  like,  panicky.  I'm just saying,  when you do small tasks,  and,  like,  you'll come in,  and,  and you'll tell Travis, 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Hey,  Travis,  I got this done for you.  And Travis goes,  Oh,  thanks.  And then you kind of give him,  like,  a point at a,  no problem,  bro.  Oh,  yes,  you do.  I just say,  oh,  all right,  man.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  And Travis,  if he's listening,  if he's not stuck in a meeting or something,  I'll bet we'll catch.  I give the thumbs up a lot.  But you're like,  yeah,  bro.  Here he comes.  I do the,  are we good?  You know,  like,  the thumbs up.  Hey,  bro.  Are we straight?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He lives,  he leaves here,  goes to class,  and then he wings over to London. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah,  all three of us have done it too.  I don't know.  I thought I'd just give the thumbs up.  No,  we'll ask you to do something,  and I love it.  Trust me,  I have no problem with this.  All right.  No,  he's great.  He's not the sharpest intern we've ever had.  He's not the dumbest.  No,  he's perfectly fine,  and he's going to go do a very important task  in about 45 minutes.  What's he doing?  He's got to go pick up some Bruce Springsteen tickets.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then,  Eric,  then he goes over to London to jam with the stones. 
[03:17:30]  But I've got a ton of faith in the kid.  But yes,  when we've asked you to do,  like,  little things,  like bring something down to somebody's office,  you'll come back and be like,  hey,  took care of that thing for you.  I expected you to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah,  well,  you know,  just letting you know the task.  Does he do the Shooter McGavin and just a,  Yes,  that's exactly what he does.  I thought I just did the thumbs up,  like,  we're good,  but I,  oh,  whatever.  I'm not aware of it.  I hope you're not aware of it,  because I want you to keep doing it.  I will, 
[03:18:00]  I will,  absolutely.  When you come back with the tickets,  or whatever you're doing,  just go,  nailed it.  Got that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take care of it for you.  Say,  remember that thing you asked for?  Yeah.  Take care of it for you.  And then if you screw up,  Yeah.  And then the other intern goes,  Travis is going to shit.  Travis is going to kill us.  And then you go,  well,  is he going to shit,  or is he going to kill us?  Something like that.  So you're saying,  I come off as a burnout.  I mean,  I've been told I've been naturally burnt,  like,  all my life.  You know,  but I come off as naturally burnt. 
[03:18:30]  Like,  you're just like a burnt guy.  Yeah,  I just,  I mean,  Are you a stoner?  I'm burnt.  No,  no.  Well,  do you ever smoke weed?  Yeah,  back in high school,  all the time.  But you don't do it in college anymore?  No,  no,  no.  How come?  At least it would make more sense.  Well,  I know,  but I'm trying.  At least you have it as an excuse.  I'm mature now,  you know?  Are you?  Yeah,  growing up.  Yeah.  I'm done with that stuff.  I don't view him as burnout.  No?  No,  I've never actually thought of that.  Oh,  good.  Because he came in while me and E-Roc were talking.  Then again,  I don't talk to him a lot.  Right.  What do I know?  And he goes, 
[03:19:00]  man,  a lot of boxes in here.  No,  I did not say that.  I said,  where's the bin?  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  where did he not say a lot of boxes in here?  Yeah,  he did.  Yes.  And then later you asked where the bin was.  Right.  Okay,  well,  I don't know what I said per se,  but I just,  you know,  I was looking for a lot of boxes in here.  Exactly.  That's all I'm saying.  I like Eric.  He's a good kid.  Thank you.  He's good.  Yes,  he's very good.  I like him.  But you know,  I don't know.  I would even say he's gnarly. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  I might be.  You know?  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Have you ever been a witness to a crime?  No.  Have you ever been a witness to somebody stopping a crime?  No.  No?  No,  I don't,  no.  Have you ever seen somebody try to rob a convenience store?  No.  No?  No.  Are you sure?  I'm not going to play into this.  No.  You never saw a guy smash a coffee pot over a robber's head?  No.  All right.  If you say so.  If you say so.  All I can do is believe you.  You've done nothing.  I don't think you're a liar.  I'm not a liar. 
[03:20:00]  No.  I don't think you're a bad guy at all.  Never lied once.  No.  I'm a great guy.  More handsome than some of the interns.  That have come in here for sure.  Why thank you.  In fact,  well I can't say you have Sal beat in terms,  I mean you both,  let's be honest,  you and Sal.  Sal's a handsome guy.  Sal and Eric,  the interns,  both have Mike the intern beat in terms of who's the most handsome.  In terms of looks?  Handsomes.  Yes.  Oh, I thank you.  But,  we need to get some ladies in here to figure out who's more handsome between you and Sal.  Do you find yourself to be more handsome than Sal?  I don't judge.  I would imagine you,  I don't think of. 
[03:20:30]  You count on your looks to get by for a lot of stuff.  Nah,  I don't really know.  Because it's not the other thing.  It is the other thing.  It is the other thing.  Is it?  I'm a very humbled man.  Yeah?  Yeah,  I don't,  you know.  Humble,  dopey,  whatever the word is.  Whatever,  yeah,  whatever you want to call me,  I just want to,  you know,  take that task and run.  You know what I mean?  I don't know,  whatever's handed to me,  I'll do it.  And you'll make,  and then afterwards,  you'll give Travis a snap and a thumbs up.  Absolutely.  Got it done,  bro.  I mean,  got it done 100%. 
[03:21:00]  Killer job.  Killed it.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  No way.  That's what you said to me that time.  I did.  Did I?  Yeah,  when I was like,  you have to bring the newspapers to the freight elevator.  Oh,  well,  that was,  that was another instance where,  you know,  the freight elevator was being worked on,  so I left the newspapers under a piano near the freight elevator.  The security showed us,  yeah,  we know.  Yeah,  yeah.  Well,  you know.  Do you remember what,  remember,  you were watching your fellow intern, 
[03:21:30]  Sal.  Yes.  And he shook Kenny's hand,  and this was off the air.  Do you remember what you said right after that?  No.  You were looking right through that window,  and you went,  awesome!  Totally awesome!  I sure did.  Yeah,  I remember that.  I forgot about that.  I remember it distinctly.  Yeah,  I forgot about that.  Well,  keep up the good work,  intern Eric.  I appreciate everything you do.  All right.  And I appreciate that you overcome some of the obstacles that God handed you.  So,  kudos to you.  I thank you.  Kudos to you.  Round of applause?  Thanks.  Yeah,  I definitely had that before.  No.  Appreciate it.  That's it.  That's the out cue. 
[03:22:00]  Good?  All right.  Yeah,  thank you.  But,  fantastic after Opie and Anthony live segment today.  Travis,  you must be feeling pretty good with the money in your pocket.  Definitely.  You felt pretty confident going into this better.  Travis bet Opie,  $200.  And it was supposed to be $100.  Opie made the claim on yesterday's show that the iPad,  the new iPad that was announced yesterday would certainly be smaller,  which I believe Opie was the only way it made sense. 
[03:22:30]  The Opie was the only person who predicted that.  But he was so sure of this that first he bet Travis $100.  And then with no coaxing whatsoever,  literally nothing,  he bet Opie,  he bet,  he increased it to $200.  We're going to $200.  I was ready to pay up.  I'm a man of my word.  But you were confident that you would.  Very confident.  I didn't think I would have to go to an ATM.  And you didn't.  Did you?  Sure didn't.  I will later to deposit my money.  To deposit it.  Yeah.  You're going to go revert.  You're going to put money in the ATM.  I'll go across the street.  Sure. 
[03:23:00]  But not before.  You said there was some sort of lunch foods involved.  Yes.  Value menu stuff?  Yes.  Okay, good.  That means you only have to break $120, though.  That's true.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I wanted to ask you about.  First break,  we were talking about Jim bringing in his monitor.  We're speaking of technology.  His monitor and his Dell speakers.  Jim, we found out,  as much as he criticizes me for hoarding stuff,  Jim is also hoarding a lot of stuff himself. 
[03:23:30]  He brought in a monitor and speakers from 2003,  from his Dell in 2003,  to see if anybody wanted them.  And this got us thinking that we should do  some kind of garage sale or auction in Cleveland.  I think that's a great idea.  Do you think this is something we can pull off?  I don't see why not.  All we got to do is just ship some boxes.  Yeah.  Right?  Like, it's not that expensive.  I mean, Opie's got it.  It's not like everybody needs a ton of shit.  No.  We're not having, like, a garage sale,  like, in terms of here's my garage full of stuff. 
[03:24:00]  It's going to be on the air.  It's not like we can actually...  Yeah, we're not doing an hour's worth of selling here.  Because you got Jim.  He can just bring in that stuff,  even if he doesn't have anything else.  Plus, he can bring in his CDs.  I'm sure, especially the mainstream ones,  like, it's one thing...  I mean, I shouldn't talk,  because I have every CD.  I have them.  And I still buy CDs from time to time.  I buy CDs, too.  I'm better...  Well, then how can you tell him to...  How come you buy CDs  if you're just going to get rid of them right away?  Because I shouldn't.  Because I still enjoy reading liner notes 
[03:24:30]  and having a physical thing.  But then once I put it in my iTunes,  I don't touch it again.  So it's really stupid.  What's the quickest turnaround time  that a CD has been in your hands?  Like, from the time you bought it  to the time you threw it out?  I don't throw them out.  I'll sell them on eBay and lots.  Will they sell?  Do people still buy lots of CDs?  Yeah.  I think used record stores  buy lots of CDs and then, you know...  If they buy 40 CDs from me for $50  and then I turn around  and sell each CD for $4... 
[03:25:00]  And it's just random lots.  Sure.  That's how I sold my DVDs  and all my CDs.  And I'm pretty confident  that people just turn around  and resell them again.  But I'm fine with that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter  because people aren't going to buy them  individually on eBay.  No, yeah.  What am I going to make?  A dollar a DVD  or, you know, $200 for 70 DVDs?  Maybe I should do that.  Yeah.  Extra pocket money.  A little extra pocket money.  Eric, we could all use  a little extra pocket money.  Am I right?  Who wouldn't?  Who wouldn't want a little extra?  Especially...  You know what?  It's getting warm out 
[03:25:30]  and it's a little early  but that means convention season  is right around the corner.  We're going to need some pocket money,  aren't we, you Rock?  No, not this year.  You're not doing the convention circuit?  There's a lot of shit  I've got to cut out this year.  Because of the house  and the exercise equipment?  Well, the house...  I just wanted to mention again  that you're buying exercise equipment.  You are buying that stuff still, right?  Still, yeah.  We're looking for stuff.  What are you getting?  I'm going to start with an elliptical.  That's it so far?  So far.  Why don't you get a set of weights  and get all fucking Shaq Diesel?  I guess. 
[03:26:00]  So, yeah,  because Jim's got this equipment.  I hope he's got this painting  that he's been talking about forever.  I don't see why  he wouldn't send that  to Cleveland to sell it.  I don't know.  Ant could bring in...  Ant could bring in...  He's got stuff.  Some old guns.  I don't know.  Yeah, Ant's got all the electronics.  Oh, but he's not going to give those away.  He's not going to...  His electronics?  Yeah.  The stuff that he's got in his office?  Anything with a hard drive,  I don't think anybody here would...  Okay, it's all old computers and stuff?  Yeah.  I understand.  Well, and even the old phones.  But I'm sure he's got stuff. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, of course he's got stuff.  We all do.  What's...  Do you...  So, since you had a kid,  did you have to start getting rid of stuff?  We didn't have to,  but, you know,  it almost makes sense to.  Yeah.  Because I can't...  I can't put my DVDs out in the living room.  She'll just, you know,  take them all and just throw them around in place.  Right.  So they were boxed up for a while,  and then I was like,  you know what?  I'm not thinking about them when they're boxed up,  so I'll just get rid of them.  They just sit in the box.  I kept one box full of signed stuff  and one box full of DVDs that I really like. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Like my Seinfeld box sets and stuff like that.  Of course.  But, yeah.  You know, when you have a kid,  your priorities change.  Yeah.  Plus, you probably need the more space.  Yeah.  Because she's got a bunch of shit now  that eventually you're going to...  It's everywhere.  I have HD DVDs.  You still have HD DVDs?  I have like 50 to 100 of them.  We got to...  You know,  you have 50 to 100 HD DVDs.  That sounds like you have every one that was made.  I don't think he paid for all of them.  No.  I don't care.  You still have them?  I have them all.  Eric, do you think this is true, E-Rock? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, I think he does.  I do.  He gets a lot of stuff sent to him.  You have 50 to 100 HD DVDs.  Yeah.  What did you watch them on?  There's still some,  like half of them are rappers.  What did you watch them on?  I have an HD DVD player.  What for?  I have a Blu-ray and a 3D Blu-ray player.  You have a 3D Blu-ray player?  Yeah, from a 3D TV.  You have a 3D television.  I love it.  What the hell do you have that for?  Do you sit around with your glasses  and watch 3D movies?  I go,  and weekends I'm like this,  and I'm like, ooh, ooh.  So you must have just so much shit  because you get sent free shit 
[03:28:00]  all the time, Roland.  Yeah.  He's got a fun house.  He's got his cotton candy maker.  Cotton candy machine.  A 3D television.  You just moved recently.  Yeah.  That must have been a pain in the ass.  No, motion movers.  I love those guys.  So is it one of those deals  where you just hire them  and then you leave  and everything's just packed up  while you're gone?  No, I packed up everything  and they just grabbed it  and shipped it.  Yeah, but it must have been  a pain in the ass to pack it up.  You have so much shit.  Like all these little things,  like the DVDs.  You see, you know, Travis,  you've moved with DVDs before.  All of a sudden, 
[03:28:30]  you don't realize  you have four boxes of DVDs  and then it takes a day  to pack them up.  Eric, how many boxes of DVDs  did you have?  Oh, cool.  That's a great question.  Probably 10 to 15.  Yeah, I'm going to guess 10 to 15.  How many boxes of DVDs?  Because I remember  going to Eric's house.  Eric's got a lot.  And you'd walk through the hall  and I said on the air before  that sometimes you'd feel  like it was closing in on you  because you'd walk  through the hallway.  Through the museum.  And it was, yeah,  and it was a narrow hallway  and it wasn't a lot of light,  which is fine,  but both walls are covered 
[03:29:00]  in framed pictures and posters.  It just frames upon frames  upon frames.  And then you go  into the living room  and every wall of the living room  was lined with Eric's DVD shelves.  One and a half.  One and a half.  One and a half walls.  Yeah.  Before you at home  think he means one and a half shelves,  it's one and a half walls.  So that's half the room.  Well, if you want,  later I'll Twitter a photo  when I go home.  I had custom shelves made  for the DVD collection. 
[03:29:30]  In the new house?  I couldn't bring  the original shelves with me.  In the new house?  Yeah.  You got it like that, huh?  Yeah.  Nice.  That's got to bother Troy,  the custom shelves.  I'll get Troy in here in a minute  and ask him what he thinks  of your custom shelves.  But I want to actually  to be able to have  some conversation before that.  So how many boxes  did you have  when you moved DVDs?  Jeez.  Well, I made the mistake  of not realizing  that packing huge boxes  of DVDs  would be really heavy.  Be heavy, too. 
[03:30:00]  And so I had...  Yeah, you think,  oh, just fit all these  into two boxes  and not realizing  you have 300 pounds  of DVDs.  That's about three feet, right?  Yeah, so they would be  three feet by two feet.  Those are big boxes.  Boxes?  Yeah, and I had...  You could fit like two...  You could fit, I think,  three of Travis's kit  in one of those boxes.  Yeah.  I think I had about  four of those  filled with DVDs.  Four three foot  by two foot boxes.  Yeah.  It might be five,  but I'm thinking four. 
[03:30:30]  That's incredible.  When you looked  at your stuff...  Like, when I moved  last time,  it was like a year  and a half ago,  all I wanted to do  was get rid of everything.  You know what I mean?  Well, I got rid  of all my CDs.  You did.  I had over a thousand  of those.  So...  I just spent time,  like, I would just  rip them into iTunes  and then...  You didn't have them  already into iTunes?  No, this was like  years ago.  Oh, okay.  I would rip them  into iTunes  and, you know,  a lot of CDs  you would get  from working  at music stations  or something like that  have that gold stamp  on it that says  that the record company  reserves the right  to take this back, 
[03:31:00]  that they own it.  Uh-huh.  And those sell  really well.  Those are more rare?  They do.  They sell really well  on eBay.  So I was just selling...  Oh, that's interesting.  Because you're not  supposed to have them.  Yeah.  And you'd sell  those individually  and then everything else  you would either group  by artist or by genre  and those kind of things.  I wonder if I had  any of those lying around.  I found a kid's book  signed by Seinfeld  and I go,  when did I get this?  Yeah, because you must  just have, like,  all you have is, like,  signed shit and promo items.  Yeah.  Because it's just like,  you're like,  oh, I guess I get this signed  or you end up  getting sent something.  I had, like, a box 
[03:31:30]  signed by the cats  at Seinfeld.  You hear that, Travis?  Yeah.  Does that make you jealous?  Yeah.  Will you give it to Travis?  No.  Will you sell it to him  for 200 bucks?  No.  Roland has a lot of stuff  everyone's jealous of.  So, when,  do you like having stuff?  No.  Like, I opened the book  as a kid's book.  I'm like,  when did I get this?  I opened it.  It says,  hope you enjoyed the book.  Jerry signed.  I'm like,  oh, yeah, that's right.  Because you don't strike me.  Roland's not materialistic at all.  Yeah, he doesn't strike me  as a guy who's materialistic.  I mean, you don't,  like, even with your money.  I just want TV and that  and I'm super happy.  Like, you don't care 
[03:32:00]  about spending money.  You don't care about  buying other people lunches.  You're just like,  okay, or like,  if you go out for drinks,  all of a sudden  you have a $300 bill  and you don't really care.  Like, you're not,  you don't care about money  or things it doesn't seem like,  but you have a lot of shit.  Yeah.  How come you don't  just get rid of everything?  Lazy.  He should just sell everything.  He'd make a ton of money.  Yeah, because I have  so many DVDs  and I got rid of those.  But then he'd just  blow all the money  on stupid shit  like a 3D TV  that he doesn't need.  Yeah, you'd be surprised  how little 
[03:32:30]  you can get for autographs.  Like on eBay?  Because you can't prove it.  There's so much fake.  You can't prove it.  And then everyone has  their own certificate  of authenticity.  That's true, yeah.  So it's like,  yeah, it doesn't mean anything.  This guy says like,  I've been reputable  for like 12 years  and this is my certificate.  Who the fuck are you?  You're some like vendor in LA.  No one cares.  Why don't you?  I have a game-used  Gretzky jersey.  That's probably my most.  You have a game-used  Gretzky jersey?  Yeah.  Is that your most  prized possession?  I think the Jordan  probably would be.  You have a game-used  Jordan jersey?  I gotta go to your,  are these on display? 
[03:33:00]  They're at my mom's house  because I got it  for my birthday  from other celebrities  years ago.  Wow.  Yeah, Roland used to be  a big, big hockey fan  when he was younger.  Yeah, and when I worked  for ESPN,  they gave me all these gifts.  What did you do for ESPN?  When was that?  Four years,  with the company  I used to work for,  we booked for...  Gotcha, you were  booking for them.  Yeah, so they gave me  like game-used bats,  hockey sticks, jerseys.  But then you also have  a bunch of,  a hundred HD DVDs  and an HD DVD player.  You have a bunch of shit too.  Why don't you, 
[03:33:30]  why don't we do  a Roland giveaway  on After Open Anthony Live  right here  and you bring in  all your HD DVDs  and your HD DVD player  and we get people  to call in  and do shit for them?  They don't want that shit.  Yes, they do.  Yes, they do.  Call in 866-WOW-1-WOW  to prove to Roland  that you want  his HD DVDs.  And we'll have Roland  sign every single one of them.  How would you like  an autographed HD DVD player  from Roland Campus?  Do you want to do that  or do you want to add it  to the garage sale?  How much would you sell 
[03:34:00]  the whole lot for?  Every HD DVD  and the HD DVD player.  Let me see how many,  like a bar special.  I'll give you $7 for it.  Everything.  Oh.  It's not worth $7.  It's worth nothing.  The format is totally obsolete.  Do you have any Laserdiscs?  I do at home.  That's the only way  you can get  the original Star Wars.  On Laserdiscs?  What do you mean the original?  The way it was made.  The 70s theatrical releases?  Yeah, that's the way.  Only on Laserdiscs?  Is that right?  They're only on Laserdiscs? 
[03:34:30]  No, they're on VHS.  But it's the edit  of the George Lucas  shitty version.  Not the VHS.  They have regular VHS ones, right?  I don't have a VHS player.  But you have a Laserdisc player?  I do.  Wait, you have a Laserdisc?  I don't have a digital age.  Yeah.  And you have an HD DVD player?  Yes.  But no VCR?  I threw that away.  But you didn't get rid  of the HD DVD.  You're thinking,  well, if Blu-ray flops,  I don't think we're going  to go digital.  We'll probably go back  to HD DVD.  No, I got the new TV.  I plugged in each player.  I went, ooh,  took each picture  in different formats. 
[03:35:00]  Is there any difference  between Blu-ray and HD DVD?  Not really.  No, I didn't think so.  You know what?  There is one difference.  They don't make one of them.  One of them is  completely discontinued.  Um, yeah, people,  look at the phone lines.  Hello, you're on  After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, I love  some of Roland's shit.  Hello, you're on  After Open Anthony Live.  Hello, you're on  After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, I'd take the DVD  collection one condition, though.  What's that? 
[03:35:30]  Roland didn't sign him, man.  Roland didn't sign him.  Hello, you're on  After Open Anthony Live.  Can I have some  of Roland's DVDs?  Everybody wants him, Roland.  Hello, you're on  After Open Anthony Live.  How about that  cotton candy machine?  Is that up for grabs?  If somebody takes  every HD DVD  and the HD DVD player,  will you take,  will you give in  the cotton candy machine?  Hell no.  No, you won't do that.  Can I give him  a hot dog machine soon?  Roland's,  Roland's apartment  is like big.  Yeah, it is.  He's got like,  and the woman's,  you know, with him. 
[03:36:00]  You mean sleepover?  Okay, but I got that bug.  No, my dad sent me  like a hot dog machine.  He got a deli slicer.  What's a hot dog machine?  It's where they roll  back and forth.  Like you'd see  at 7-11 or something.  Yeah, my dad got me  one of those.  Do those make better hot dogs?  No.  They just keep them warm.  Just grill them.  Every good hot dog place  you go to, they grill.  They don't use a hot dog machine.  Only the shitty places  use hot dog machines.  And then my dad got me  a deli slicer.  For what?  To sandwiches.  You live in New York.  Go to a deli. 
[03:36:30]  Wait, hold on.  Right there.  Shout out to my man.  Right there.  He knows.  I was just thinking of Seinfeld  when Kramer had the deli slicer.  I thought of, too.  Chris, you're on  after Open Anthony Live.  I'd actually want it  for my husband.  He would think  those were great.  HD DVDs.  Rick, you're on  after Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, I'd take the DVDs.  Marcos, you're on  after Open Anthony Live.  Hey, I don't want the DVDs.  I just want to say  what's up to you guys.  What's up, Marcos?  Izzy, you're on  after Open Anthony Live.  Hey, I'll take the shit.  See? 
[03:37:00]  Everybody wants your shit, Roland.  People just want things.  I'll bring in four tomorrow.  What did we learn?  We'll give them away  like a little bit at a time.  Yeah.  And then at the end  of the giveaway,  you'll bring in the actual...  But we don't announce  the title of the DVD  until the person  actually won it.  HD DVD.  Eric, don't misrepresent anything.  They're all HD DVDs.  Yes.  Yes.  We're going to do that?  Sure.  Spencer, did you know  Roland has a collection  of HD DVDs in his house?  No, but I'm not surprised.  No, you're not at all.  Spencer's one of the 
[03:37:30]  other talent bookers.  Roland, you're needed.  You can take Roland.  He's all yours.  We got what we needed  out of him.  It's personal.  He's got to discuss things.  Things that go on  with the talent  we don't need to, you know,  to bring to the air.  You missed earlier  while you were talking  about HD DVDs.  Elizabeth Olsen  was peeking into the studio.  Was she looking at me?  Right at you.  Did she say anything?  I can't hear.  I'm in this glass booth there.  But she was peeking in.  Did she mouth anything  that you could read her lips?  I don't know, but she...  Who's that cutie on a mic?  Something like that? 
[03:38:00]  Does anyone have HD DVDs?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Those guys.  We could hook Roland up.  This is a good question  from John  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  What's up, John?  Hey, Sam.  What I want to know  is how much money  is it going to take  you could bring all your dolls  in the studio  and let Opie smash them  in front of you?  I would give up  all my wrestling figures.  You have duplicates, right?  Yeah, but he said all of them.  Meaning I would have to  bring in the duplicates  and everything.  If they don't know that,  you could just bring in  the duplicates  and say that's all of them.  I'm a man of integrity, Eric.  We discussed this earlier 
[03:38:30]  about your questionable integrity.  I have integrity, okay?  I'm not going to lie about it.  That's why your stuff  gets broken.  That's exactly correct.  By you, as a matter of fact.  If you look at the video  on Opie Radio's YouTube page,  E-Rock smashed my television.  It would cost,  I mean, it would cost  over a million dollars.  Wow, come on, now.  All you need is to replace  the Nagel Tron  and you'll be good.  Thanks, John.  Oh, that's long gone.  You left that  at your older place, right?  Yeah, I abandoned it.  You just, you need the money  to be able to buy them  back on eBay  and then a little extra. 
[03:39:00]  And then something for myself.  Yeah.  Some of them are very hard to find.  Well, you got the money.  I got the million.  Yeah.  I'll do it for $1.5 million.  $1.5 million.  I'm putting the offer out there.  Opie, if you're listening,  I will do this.  I will bring in my entire  pro wrestling action figure collection.  Every last one of them.  The ones in the box,  the ones out of the box,  everything.  And you can smash them  for $1.5 million.  Do you think it'll take me up on it?  I don't know.  You might double it.  You think I'll give you $3 million?  Opie, this is not a good bet either. 
[03:39:30]  Everybody's still calling in  trying to get rolling stuff  and wanting to get  the Jeremy Lin shirts now.  So, Eric,  you had a rough one today.  I did all right.  I would say,  I would say,  I mean,  you know,  you got,  oh,  oh,  electric Dave and Flint  who feedbacks in from time to time  on the HD DVD note  wants to know  if Travis has any cassette tapes  he could give away.  I have cassette tapes.  What do you have?  I think I have cassette singles 
[03:40:00]  of Mr. Lava Lava by Shaggy  and I wish I was a little bit taller.  I have that one too.  You have the cassette singles?  I used to have that one.  Yes.  Oh man,  that was the first time  I bought a rap anything.  I bought a rap tape  and made me realize  that I was,  I felt like I was breaking  a color barrier in that moment.  I was like,  you know what?  I,  Sam Roberts,  a white kid,  just bought a rap tape  not realizing that  every kid who ever goes into Sam Goody 
[03:40:30]  is,  every white kid  buys dumb rap tapes.  I didn't know at the time.  I got mine at  Nobody Beats the Wiz.  That was the best part.  I have a,  Sam Goody.  I have a cassette tape  of my brother and I  used to do prank phone calls.  Oh,  you do?  Yeah.  I would have to really look for it.  I don't even know  if it's at my apartment.  It might be in like  a box at my dad's house.  Well,  maybe,  but it exists.  There's some things  that are worth really looking for.  How come you and your brother,  you and your brother  are the ones that  invented Peenie Flip,  invented Undie Flip,  did the prank calls. 
[03:41:00]  Did you and your brother  dream of starting  some kind of comic duo?  I think so.  Like the Scalar brothers?  We were really good.  My brother was great  at these prank phone calls.  What does your brother  do now for a living?  I don't know.  You don't know what he does?  No.  Do you talk to him?  Not in the last year.  Why?  Just.  Travis's family  just doesn't get along  with each other.  Just issues.  Okay.  Well,  I mean,  it's weird.  Your childhood.  At least you had a good childhood.  A great childhood.  And now you've got  your own family 
[03:41:30]  so you can  just hang out  with your dad  and your family  that you're building.  I'm going to start fresh.  Everything fell apart.  Everything was great.  You guys did great.  Luckily,  I was an adult  and then everything fell apart.  I'm going to start fresh.  We text each other now and then.  And I'm going to fix everything.  My brother and I.  I can find that tape, though.  I think it would.  Maybe not in like the next week,  but I mean,  it would require  a day at my dad's house  going through boxes.  I think it'd be worth doing.  Yeah.  I mean,  and only because  I like a funny prank phone call  as much as the next guy.  It's been  at least 15 years 
[03:42:00]  since I've even listened to it.  Wow.  So.  When,  when the last time  you remember listening to it,  was it good?  Oh, yeah.  It was great.  We were 13 years old  making prank phone calls  while our parents were at home.  I'm sure they're terrible.  Rob,  you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Sam.  Yeah.  You're always busting  everybody's balls.  I hate this after show,  but I really love it.  I know you do.  You guys are a fucking riot  for one.  Thank you.  A bunch of babble. 
[03:42:30]  And you're always  busting Eric's balls.  I think all you guys  need to get together  and bust Sam's balls.  It's simple as that.  I still have the sledgehammer.  My balls have been busted before.  My balls get busted  on the regular show.  But the thing is,  when you're busting Eric's balls,  you realize  it's not going to get  out of fun zone.  Like,  if I started going after Danny,  it's an investment  because Danny would come in here  and there'd be a fight.  If I started going after Troy  and I have,  Troy will get shitty  and he'll start being like, 
[03:43:00]  you know,  like,  dude,  why would you even take that shot?  I mean,  I don't even understand  why you'd take that shot.  I'm coming in here  because you asked me  to come in here.  And then it becomes  exhausting.  I don't want his bullshit either.  All right,  I'll tell that.  I'll tell that.  Thank you,  Rob.  Sorry to hang up on you.  Troy,  you understand  as much as any of us  that,  and the same goes for me,  by the way.  The reason Danny and Travis  and Troy don't start fights with me  is because he'd be exhausting.  Right, 
[03:43:30]  but I'm not afraid to bust your balls.  I mean,  yesterday,  we were talking about Kenny.  Right.  And I told you,  dude,  you're pussy whipped.  You gotta,  I was busting your balls about  being the fuck,  are you the dude for the show?  Right.  Like,  are you the host?  Yeah,  that happened just yesterday.  Yeah.  But people,  like,  people just don't realize  that,  like,  Eric,  when it comes time to  pointing out his flaws,  it's a little easier.  And,  Eric,  you don't,  no,  it's not.  You said I was exhausting earlier.  No,  you're exhausting to work with.  Not, 
[03:44:00]  not to point out your flaws.  Still exhausting.  You're easy.  No,  you're exhausting in the  complete wrong way.  Like,  most of us are easy to work with,  but exhausting to have an argument with.  You're easiest in the world  to have an argument with,  but exhausting to work with.  Change it up.  Yeah,  you are changing it up.  Troy,  people seem like,  you know,  based on what happened today  on the show,  and what happened was,  Eric was back,  he had his sick day yesterday, 
[03:44:30]  and,  uh,  Opie was saying he thought  it was a fake sick day.  Uh,  he,  Opie asked you to come in,  and by the way,  Anthony and Jim also were saying  it's a fake sick day,  for the record.  Yeah.  But Opie specifically said,  where's Troy?  We gotta get Troy in here.  He invited you in,  and asked for your opinion.  Yeah.  Now,  that aside,  do you think  that people  are right  in criticizing you  for saying  you're a bit judgmental,  you're,  you're opinionated?  Uh,  no,  that's fine.  They can say that. 
[03:45:00]  Sure.  Troy got a lot of hate today.  A lot of hate,  but,  and,  and Troy's right,  and as I was sitting there,  I was thinking  that I'm glad Troy is doing this,  because when I start shitting on Eric  to the level that Troy was,  I get that hate.  Yeah.  Like,  Eric's the underdog,  of course,  Eric's Rudy.  Sure.  Except without the thing at the end.  Sure.  Eric is Rudy with,  just in the hardship.  Um,  and like I said,  people,  people listening  are,  uh,  the people that are angry at me  are fat,  and they probably are lazy 
[03:45:30]  at their jobs.  Of course,  they don't think they are,  because nobody's,  nobody fat really thinks like,  oh,  I'm a lazy fucking piece of shit.  I don't want to do my,  I don't want to do my job.  I'm not saying,  I'm not saying anybody's,  uh,  here's a fat lazy piece of shit.  Good.  I'm just saying that,  you know,  they,  they're at their job,  they're,  they don't want to work hard,  and they want to be lazy,  and they want to get out early,  they want to take the easy,  easy road,  and,  uh,  of course,  they're going to relate to him,  because he's getting his balls busted,  they probably get their balls busted  at their job, 
[03:46:00]  for the same reason.  Eric,  do you think  that Troy  has too deep of an opinion on you?  No,  he's entitled to his opinion.  But you generally,  when you argue with him,  you start saying,  you know,  why do you care so much,  why do you care so much?  You don't think he should care so much,  you think his opinion of you  is too deep.  Well,  it seems like  there's always an underlining tone  that Troy has something  personally invested  in this argument.  And that I don't get,  because I don't see where that is.  Other than if,  you know,  being friends and he's concerned, 
[03:46:30]  that's one thing,  but it always seems like  there's something...  That's bullshit, though.  You know that's bullshit.  Okay.  So,  it just seems like  there's something lower  in that argument  that I'm not understanding here.  Do you have a personal investment  in the,  in the,  Eric,  in his health,  in his,  when you start arguing with him?  Because you do,  you passionately,  you passionately argue against him.  Well,  I mean,  I think he definitely needs  to get his health in order.  I mean,  that's just common sense.  And there's no argument in that.  Okay.  But you know,  you take,  sometimes you take it like  it's personally offending you. 
[03:47:00]  Is it?  I mean,  am I the only one that thinks that?  No,  I agree with you.  That's why I,  is it personally offending you?  It's like,  it's like,  if you ask Travis or Danny  to come down here  and,  hey,  guys,  come down here  and comment on,  comment on Sam's ability  to,  to do certain things  or,  they're going to have  their opinion on,  on that situation.  Yeah.  And,  and if they don't have an opinion,  they probably don't have  a lot of business  being in front of a microphone.  Right.  And I don't think  that anybody would  call them down  to,  to say, 
[03:47:30]  to voice their opinion  on something  if they didn't have  something to say about it.  Yeah.  So,  I don't care,  like,  I could live the rest  of my life  and Eric could live  the rest of his life  and,  and,  and I'd never comment  on this again  but if they call me in here  I'm going to say,  yeah,  you know what,  he really is an,  he,  he's unhealthy,  he's getting bigger  and he's not taking care  of himself  and it's going to run  into complications later.  On what level  does Eric's habits  and health bother you?  Like,  is this something  that you'll go home  and you'll think about it 
[03:48:00]  for a second  and be like,  fuck.  No,  I don't really care.  I mean,  as soon as I leave here  none of this matters to me.  It really doesn't.  I got so much else  going on outside here  that it's just like,  okay,  this is my job,  this is what we're doing.  I heard you're not  a good DJ  so it can't be that.  Right,  it can't be that at all.  That's what the lady said.  Yeah,  that's fine.  And,  but yeah,  I mean,  I don't really care  the second I leave here  but,  you know,  if we're going to talk about it,  let's talk about it.  And honestly,  health is a very important thing  and I'm very passionate  about trying to stay healthy,  trying to stay active.  I work out regularly  and I encourage  healthy,  a healthy lifestyle 
[03:48:30]  towards the plight  of the fat man.  Um,  I think,  but possibly,  but you know what,  Eric,  do you think Troy's  insensitive to your plight?  you can't fault him on that  because it's not like  Troy just came in here  and go,  dude,  I can't fucking stand  the way you live  and what you do.  He's always asked  to come in  and share his opinion  but that being said,  then all of a sudden  Troy just goes,  you know,  gloves are off,  I'm going right straight for you  but it's just like,  you went from zero to 60.  He's an intense guy.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  And I don't even really think  I'm all that  mean.  Like,  I don't know.  I said intense.  And whatever I give,  I fully expect in return.  You're very,  you're harsh  and direct  and people interpret  that as mean  when they're not used to it.  I think,  like,  when I'm arguing  or when I'm trying,  it's not even arguing.  When I say something  that Jess is doing wrong,  for instance,  my fiancee Jess,  I'll say,  no,  you did it  or if she's arguing  with somebody,  right? 
[03:49:30]  And I'll be like,  no,  actually,  they're right,  you're wrong.  She'll have a problem  with the fact  that I didn't take her side  or that I was too mean  or something.  Right.  Like,  it's just  some people  aren't used to having  the direct harshness.  Right.  And I don't think  Eric has a lot of that  in his life.  But look,  he's surrounded by people  that are so fucking  direct and harsh  that why is what I'm giving  any worse  than what anybody else is giving?  I don't think Eric responds  to the directness.  Shut up.  Roland,  why are you cursing at Troy? 
[03:50:00]  You're just fucking around.  You're just weird.  And then he's leaving.  He just walks in.  He stands behind me.  Eric,  you don't respond  to direct harshness.  No,  because I don't need to.  Like,  why would I respond?  Like,  on air is one thing,  but if this was like  off air  and that was coming at me,  it's like,  why would I waste my time  dealing with this?  And how often do I talk to you  about any of this off the air?  I never said you did.  Okay.  But you would.  I mean,  you have.  You stopped for New Year's. 
[03:50:30]  I've been trying.  You used to.  I've been making a conscious effort.  What was it?  Hold on.  Troy would also get the on-air  set up in the office  by Sam starting something  and then Troy would come in there  and then,  you know,  come guns a-blazing  with his opinions,  whatever.  This is Nazi Germany  and a guy can't ask  somebody's opinion?  No,  but you seem to like  starting the shit  and then when it gets  too exhausting in my room,  you'll take Troy over  to another office  or to somebody else's desk  and then he'll yell  at Steve Sturney  or somebody else.  It's not difficult  to get Troy riled up at all.  No,  but you see where the catalyst 
[03:51:00]  is coming from off air.  Roland's outside  pointing at people now.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's just,  he's a fucking,  I think he's telling guests  that the hallway's closed.  A lot of people don't realize  Roland's a fucking idiot.  A lot of people.  He's punch drunk  ready for Bruce Springsteen.  Is that what it is?  He's acting silly.  Because it said on,  Roland said on the show today  that he got confirmation  that he was getting  Springsteen tickets.  Yeah.  And is that what it is now?  Yeah.  He's got Julia from XMU  and he's actually trying  to drag her towards the studio.  I have nothing to say to her.  Why is he trying to pull her in?  I don't know.  This is an interesting point. 
[03:51:30]  Scott wants to comment  on this whole thing.  Go ahead, Scott.  Right here on  After Open Anthony Live.  What's up, Scott?  Sam,  you know,  you guys have had  a great conversation here,  but Troy just let something slip.  When they ask  if he thinks about this  when he goes home,  he doesn't.  So this is just fodder  for the TV show.  If you spend near as much time  worrying about your job  that you should do  about E-Rock,  it'd be in fucking  E-Rock's position.  You're just a fucking tool,  Troy.  So, first of all,  this isn't a TV show.  I mean, so,  I don't really think 
[03:52:00]  you have any room  to call me a tool, dude,  because you're listening  on your radio.  That's first and foremost.  Yeah, but I'm driving  from work, dumbass.  What are you supposed  to be doing?  I'm getting paid.  Yo, I'm getting paid  for this asshole,  so fuck you.  And that's not,  it's not a television show.  What?  So am I.  You're getting paid,  you're not on a television show.  No, I'm getting paid  to listen to you.  I just have to clarify everything.  Satellite radios  do not qualify  as television sets.  Go ahead.  So then you're gonna  call me a fucking tool 
[03:52:30]  and you're gonna say  a stupid statement  like that,  you fucking moron.  Wow.  You stupid fucking idiot.  Worry about your own job,  worry about your pathetic life  and your small apartment  and your eight jobs  while E-Rock  goes down to his fucking house  with his wife,  who's beautiful,  and has a fucking paycheck  that he can afford  to do shit like this.  All right.  Well, point made, sir.  Thank you.  You're a fucking tool.  Oh, that hurts.  Hurts coming from you.  I mean, unfortunately,  the thing is,  we've talked about this  and Eric does have  a beautiful wife  in a mansion. 
[03:53:00]  However, his beautiful wife  sits in his mansion  saying,  Eric, why aren't you  more active?  Right.  And Troy goes back  to his tiny little apartment  and he's just fucking  underage chicks every night.  It's underage.  No.  It's not underage.  Absolutely not.  I was misinformed.  What is it?  Underage raver chicks.  Raver chicks.  Is that what it is?  Glow sticks and ecstasy  and shit like that?  No, no, no, no.  A lot of it, right?  Nope.  Nope.  A whole bunch.  A whole bunch.  Well, do you like  coming on here  and letting everything  be heard?  Well, yeah, of course. 
[03:53:30]  It's fun.  It's fun to talk shit.  And I talk shit  and I expect people  to talk shit back to me.  I mean, that's just  part of this show.  That's the fun of this show.  Eric, what stops you  from being open?  What?  What stops you  from being open?  You're open.  Just like you just  say shit.  I try to be  when certain subjects  come up.  No, you're not at all.  You are far from  an open person.  You keep a lot of shit  hidden.  You keep your life  very secretive.  You're very secretive  about everything.  And it just,  it's like when everybody 
[03:54:00]  is opening up  about everything,  like the hosts  of the show  tell the dirtiest,  darkest secrets  of their life.  Sam will say  fucking crazy shit.  Like, we're like,  shit that's like  going to upset  his family  and his fiancee  and still does it  for the benefit  of the show  and the benefit  of the honesty  because nobody  wants to get  called out on bullshit  because that ruins  your credibility  for everything.  And when there's  a lot of shit  that you hide  from people  and you're very  secretive about. 
[03:54:30]  Not hide,  it's just not  offered up.  Well, yeah.  When certain things  come up and they  go into a certain  direction,  there's shit that  I've revealed  on this show  that I've gone along  with it and been open  but I don't just  sit there and go,  hey, here's another  thing about me  we can talk about.  No, but like  the dentist thing today,  why don't you just say  I have to sleep  with this thing  and like it was  this whole secretive  thing that I can't  want to talk about this.  I don't want to talk  about it.  It's like,  just say that you  had to go to the  fucking dentist  for your thing.  Like, why is it  the way?  And it goes to what  everybody was talking  about, about text 
[03:55:00]  messages and everything  else involved.  You're just so secretive  about everything.  You have to keep  everything a mystery  and it's just,  I don't understand it.  And then, yeah,  I goof on you  and I say stuff  but there's a lot  of things that happen  that lead up to  this point that's  just like,  oh God, Eric.  And Sam and I  will talk,  Sam knows.  Is this where  I'm exhausting?  Yes.  Yes, very much so.  Your closed  off-ness is exhausting  because the problem  is that even  off the air, 
[03:55:30]  you keep a lot  of shit to yourself  and that's fine  but it makes you  seem like you're  up to something.  all the time.  Always.  Always up to something.  Not to say that you are  because half,  and then what's  exhausting is  everybody goes,  oh, what's E-Rock  up to?  What's he being  so secretive about?  And then you find  out what it is  and it's nothing  and you go,  this is exhausting.  Well, that's your  own fault.  No, Eric,  we're trying to have  relationships with you  here.  No, no, no,  for later  because I only got 
[03:56:00]  five minutes.  Shut the fuck up.  Yeah, no, no.  Yeah, I got three  minutes left.  I can't take an  interview now,  but I got three  minutes left,  Roland.  Shut up!  Three minutes.  This is your channel,  you chicken shit.  It's not my channel.  I would take it  if they wanted to  give it to me.  Shut the fuck up,  Roland.  But, like, I think  I would have to  agree with Troy  that, you know,  there's a lot of  closed-off-ness  that makes it seem  like you're up to  something. 
[03:56:30]  And if I'm too  revealing, it's like,  oh, I'm full of  myself.  So I just don't  say that.  Nobody's ever said  that about you.  It's not, if you're  too revealing, you're  not full of yourself.  Hey, Mr.  Man, hold on.  I need you to say  in two minutes.  In two minutes?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Wrap this shit up.  Hey, you're fine.  You're all right.  You wrap this shit up.  Shut the fuck up,  Roland.  He's all wound up  for Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah, you're just  excited to go to Bruce.  Hey, Roland, dinosaur  barbecue tomorrow?  You put your sweet  tits?  We're going to go  out for barbecue  before Bruce Springsteen.  And? 
[03:57:00]  What's that?  He still owes you  a handjob.  Yeah, you still  owe me a handjob.  That'll be done  later on.  Yes, I do.  Well, I mean,  what do you think  of that, Eric?  I want to go to  Bruce Springsteen  and get a handjob.  You see what I mean,  Troy?  Yeah.  No getting through  to him.  Nope.  Thick, thick skull.  Yeah.  Very thick.  Well, I'm glad  you're back, E-Rock.  Glad you're feeling  better.  Are you feeling  better than you  were this morning?  No, my throat  still sucks.  I'm sorry to hear  that.  Hopefully, it'll be  100% tomorrow.  When this all  continues, stay
