<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast extensively covered Hurricane Sandy, its projected path, and the media's coverage, interweaving this with numerous tangents and comedic bits.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, consistently expressed skepticism about the storm's predicted severity and the accuracy of weather forecasts, particularly regarding the anticipated sharp left turn. Opie vehemently argued against the predicted turn, using highly vulgar language throughout the broadcast.  This skepticism was shared by a guest, Ira, a weather expert.  The show featured numerous off-color jokes, discussions of bodily functions, and speculation about Mayor Bloomberg's appearance during a press conference.  One host recounted a wild Halloween party featuring heavy drinking, karaoke, and impromptu scuba diving in his pool.  The hosts repeatedly mocked the media's perceived fear-mongering, citing examples like a news reporter in a canoe in calm waters and a lone lifeguard stand in the ocean.  Kenny, a staff member, reported uneventful conditions from Manhattan, highlighting the questionable food from a local deli.  Roland, another staff member, was ridiculed for his excessive hurricane preparations. A phone call with a Port Authority spokesperson provided insight into the city's preparedness, or lack thereof. A humorous, sexually explicit segment, "Cock Talk," discussed a caller's first homosexual experience.  The show also debated Opie's purportedly accurate prediction of the Detroit Tigers' World Series win.


A significant portion of the show focused on the absence of co-hosts Troy Kwan and Sal due to the storm.  The hosts heavily criticized their lack of attendance, despite offers of transportation and hotel accommodations, contrasting their perceived lack of work ethic with their own dedication.  They played a clip of Ann Coulter debating Piers Morgan and discussed Chad Myers' tweets about the storm, juxtaposing them with the relatively mild weather.  Richard Schaefer, the supervisor of the town of Babylon, called in to provide a local update.  Listener calls further fueled the discussion of the storm's impact and Sal's absence.  The absence of Sal was a recurring theme, with repeated criticism of his justification for missing work.  The hosts shared numerous anecdotes about their past work experiences and hardships, including sleeping in the studio and working through difficult conditions.


A guest, Pat Duffy, called in to express disgust with Sal's behavior and offered to replace him.  The show included segments unrelated to the hurricane, including child-rearing advice from Andrew Dice Clay, a clip from a Canadian radio show featuring a cancer society representative, a trivia game, and a discussion of a past Opie & Anthony broadcast concerning Hurricane Katrina. A humorous bit from another radio show involving the phrase "Beat Breakfast Bacon Time" was also played.  The show also played and extensively discussed a viral video of Meat Loaf's disastrous performance at a Romney campaign event, with the hosts using highly offensive language to describe him.  Jim Norton was a guest in the studio, discussing his upcoming tour dates. Sam Roberts hosted "After O&A Live," continuing the criticism of Sal and Troy's absence while praising E-Rock for making it to work. The show briefly touched upon Gary Condit and the 9/11 attacks.  Sam Roberts and his wife, Jess, discussed their experience in a Times Square hotel during the storm. Numerous calls regarding the show's intern position followed the criticism of Sal.  Discussions of CM Punk and a YouTube video featuring “Stone Cold E.T.” also occurred. The show ended with uncertainty about whether it would air the following day due to the storm.  Throughout the broadcast, there was extensive use of profane and offensive language and potentially offensive topics.  The unexpected abundance of taxis visible on a live television weather report was also a source of amusement for the hosts. The hosts also discussed their ability to make it into the studio given potential flooding.

[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Here are the studios of Sirius XM satellite radio. 
[00:03:30]  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  So vulgar.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second. 
[00:04:00]  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  ONA every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah! 
[00:04:30]  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the grub.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  Why does it smell too bad?  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Pying to these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off. 
[00:05:00]  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Oh, you want to hear the greatest of all?  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Oh my goodness.  From Storm Central, New York City.  Yes, we are your storm leader.  Your storm information center. 
[00:05:30]  We're right here in the thick of it.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  What was it, Josh?  Whoa.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, look out.  Anthony doesn't think this hurricane's gonna take its left turn.  All right, look.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony says he don't believe it.  I'm willing to go on the record right now.  Uh-oh.  Right now, on the record. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Which means this will get replayed no matter what happens.  But here's what I think.  I have no science to back this up whatsoever, except for past performance.  I cannot foresee this hurricane making this crazy-ass left turn.  Boy, it happens all the time, doesn't it?  No.  It's never happened before.  It just doesn't happen.  But every single one of these guys are convinced this left turn is happening.  And you know what?  They want it to happen very badly. 
[00:06:30]  But they're also warning people.  They've basically been saying the last 24 hours, look, we know sometimes we exaggerate,  but we're not exaggerating this time.  Yeah, but if you look back, they've said that in the past.  I know.  I'm just thinking.  You don't think there's not gonna be a left turn?  Oh, my God.  You're crazy.  It was going a little northeast, the hurricane.  And then they went, well, it's starting its turn.  Yeah.  And now it's heading north.  Right.  Just plain north.  That's turning.  That's turning away from the northeast. 
[00:07:00]  That is a far cry.  Before it goes west, it's gotta go a little north, right?  Dude, a far fucking cry from this unbelievable left-hand turn that it's supposed to take.  I know Ant and Ira have the same forecast.  Yes.  I know that.  Wasn't it supposed to be here already?  Like, didn't they first say that it was gonna hit last night?  It seems that it's slowed down a little bit.  Slowed down.  It's doing anything.  I know one thing.  I know Hurricane Judy would make three rights, which then would make a left-hand turn. 
[00:07:30]  I don't know.  I'm usually fully aware of fear-mongering.  Yeah.  But I've been kind of watching this for the last 24 hours, going to all sorts of different  news sources.  I don't know, man.  I think it's making the left turn.  I can't buy this left turn thing.  And believe me, I could totally be wrong.  I probably am wrong.  If it doesn't make the left turn, it's still kind of shitty weather, obviously.  It'll be windy and a lot of rain and stuff, but not to the point they're talking if it  makes the left turn.  They are talking Armageddon.  My drive in this morning... 
[00:08:00]  Beautiful, right?  Yeah.  But it had this feel about it with the signs on the road, like all mass transit closed,  mandatory evacuations, bridges and tunnels can be closed at any moment.  You're like, it's like this Armageddon feeling that they're throwing out there.  And I honestly don't think that this will be one of these Katrina-type things.  I would love New York City if every day was like today.  It is nice out there.  None of those pesky buses on the road. 
[00:08:30]  No one's beeping.  There were barely any cabs.  There were no pedestrians.  It was just nice.  I was winging across three lanes to make my curve down the parkway.  I would just go across from lane to lane, cut the apex.  Yeah, you just had the whole road to yourself.  Extra wide lanes.  This is luxurious.  How long do you think the city would survive under these circumstances with no people?  No cars on the road.  Like Sim City?  Because I like it this way.  Yeah, I like it too.  What, a couple months and that would be all economically would be just a disaster? 
[00:09:00]  Just fall apart.  Yeah.  I panicked in Philly.  I fucking was doing my gigs and Kenny went to the deli for me in Philly.  There was a deli open and I'm fucking, I'm like, you know what?  There's going to be no delis open because there's no fucking people to go to the delis.  And so I said, Kenny got me some sandwiches from the delis.  I took sodas and water from the fucking club.  Wow.  And he's the worst when you have a disaster coming.  Because I'm like, ah, you think some of the delis will be open?  He goes, yeah, but then the shelves might be empty. 
[00:09:30]  He's not wrong about that.  Yes, he is.  We drove in last night.  There was nothing but delis open.  It was fucking deli city.  And I'm like, look at all these delis.  And he goes, yeah, but if the power goes out.  I'm like, I know.  And then if a rock hits us, we're all dead.  I was out there yesterday.  I walked home from Penn Station after the Jets game.  Had to take some trains home.  Yeah.  What a fucking nightmare.  I don't want to do that ever again.  But anyway, but every deli, every CVS, every supermarket had lines out the door, though. 
[00:10:00]  People love stocking up.  And I got the kids, so I had to be one of those idiots.  I've never been one of those idiots.  Yeah.  For the first time, I had to be one of those idiots and get on the line and get basic supplies.  I had to get milk and bread and shit.  I had to.  I got two little ones.  I would have never done it for myself or just me and my wife.  Of course.  And literally, the first time in my life I've ever had to fucking, we used to laugh at those people, right?  Yes, we did.  And I discovered that no one likes pumpkin bread.  It's the only bread.  Was that the only thing left on a shelf? 
[00:10:30]  I swear to you.  And I don't know why I didn't take a picture of it.  It was just sitting there all sad on the shelf.  The only pumpkin bread.  And everyone was looking for bread, and no one would take the pumpkin bread.  Pumpkin bread.  Fuck that shit.  It doesn't sound appetizing, right?  Not at all.  Not at all.  So, yeah, I thought it was going to hit.  I thought we were going to wake up this morning.  It was going to be sideways rain and a bunch of wind, but it's not even raining outside yet here in New York City.  And this is part of the beginning of the collapse of this fucking death story that they got. 
[00:11:00]  But they were saying that when you wake up for your commute, there's going to be a lot of flooding.  Right.  And even though they've been saying it wasn't supposed to happen last night and stuff, and it's more this afternoon and this evening that they're saying it's going to be like the brunt of this.  Right.  Once it makes that left-hand turn.  You don't think it's making the left-hand turn?  It's not turning.  Come on.  They know why they're saying that.  It's because there's a giant cloud hand signaling for a left.  Yes, it's got its hand out the window.  So, God, we're usually in agreement with this horse shit because I think they're all assholes because they all want the ratings and they want the viewers. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  I think it's making the left-hand turn.  All right.  We'll have to see.  I see it going north.  I see it hitting maybe Maine, maybe a little bit of Boston.  Wait, where do you think this thing is going to hit?  They're saying south of us in Jersey.  Dude, I see this thing running over like a little bit of the tail of Massachusetts.  I see it going into Maine.  Oh, my God, you're crazy.  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  So, it's not making that left-hand turn into Jersey. 
[00:12:00]  Left-hand turn, schmeft-hand turn.  I am not fucking seeing this at all.  Wow.  Sorry.  See, I can't pick winners in sports, but I think I know what's going on here.  Oh.  What is that map, that infrared map?  What is that telling anybody?  You never want orange.  Those are the outer bands of precipitation.  Yeah, you never want orange or yellows.  That are now over the Jersey Shore.  Green's easy.  You could laugh at green.  You don't want that yellow and reds and oranges. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  That's heavy rains.  That's the first thing I'm seeing of this thing completely falling apart is the fact that it didn't happen this morning.  That people didn't wake up for their commute to this massive flooding and rain and wind and stuff.  It's windy.  I'll give it that.  But no, shut down your whole fucking infrastructure wind.  Right.  And, you know, I don't know.  I'm just gonna...  I could be totally wrong.  Well, CNN is...  Where are they right now? 
[00:13:00]  Now, hurricane winds could knock out power to an estimated 10 million people along the northeast if the hurricane goes as is now being expected.  You'll remember, in the last hurricane, Hurricane Irene, there were people who lost power for two weeks.  What could be the implications of 10 million people losing power in the northeast?  Let's get right to Christine Romans.  She's got an update on that for us.  Christine, good boy.  Oh, an update.  Then, last night, it got so bad, they just started showing a map of all the nuclear power plants on the north. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, that's...  Yeah, they need every fucking fear monger.  And then they basically admitted, we're just kind of showing you this.  We don't predict that they'll have any problems.  And I'm like, you fucking assholes.  What's Chad doing this morning?  Chad!  Chad!  Did you see Chad's tweet on Thursday or Friday?  No.  He was calling Armageddon.  And Peter's Morgan called him out on it.  That's a clip you could find there, Sam.  Did he?  Basically called him out on it, and Chad goes,  Well, that was last night.  And you know, Twitter, you tweet what's happening in your mind at that moment.  That's exactly what I believed last night when I tweeted that. 
[00:14:00]  But I'm not believing that as much right now today.  That's hilarious.  You got to get the actual tweet.  Chad!  It was pretty amazing.  Chad's an idiot.  Yeah, Chad is an idiot.  Let's see.  Look, the Jersey Shore Towns are going to get fucking walloped.  Those people already know that.  They know they're going to be in rowboats and all that shit.  Right?  Yeah.  After 26 years in TV weather, Sandy may pose the greatest risk to human life that I have seen. 
[00:14:30]  Please keep up.  Really?  Even more than Katrina?  And Piers Morgan retweeted that and just wrote, Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  What a load of shit.  So then on Friday night, Piers Morgan, I was watching him.  He had Chad on.  He goes, Chad, did you tweet it?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He goes, well, that's what I was thinking last night when I tweeted that.  I don't think that anymore.  Chad's a drama queen.  Yeah.  Chad's a fool.  Chad's an asshole.  Chad loves drama.  That woman was right to go, Chad! 
[00:15:00]  She's been dealing with him in the lunchroom for years at the coffee pot.  Well, if you let me talk, Harold.  Oh, all his tweets are just barometric pressures.  Yeah.  And how they're going down and he's trying to explain it.  You know how many times she's been getting coffee and he said, hey, hug your parents.  It's going to be a doozy.  Yeah.  Look out.  Oh, please.  I'm an official shelter location.  I'm an evac station.  Are you?  My house?  Yes. 
[00:15:30]  Are you taking your pets, too?  It's a lot of fun.  Yes.  I actually have two doggies at my house.  Aw!  And I have, let's see, I have Ange and the two kids.  And I have the lovely Teffs, Travis, Lisa, and the adorable Riley.  And I have the Danny Ross and Danny's girlfriend, Lauren.  And I have one dog that sounds like a zombie from The Walking Dead. 
[00:16:00]  Is that Travis's awful dog?  Yes.  What's wrong with his dog?  It's one of those dogs that just have the smashed faces where, you know, they make those sounds.  French bulldog.  And then I got this giant bulldog, which is Ange's and Keith's, that just loves coming up and panting hot breath into your face when you're laying on the couch.  Hot, spoiled breath.  Get away!  You don't like that? 
[00:16:30]  I hate hot dog breath.  Yeah, but it's so low to that peanut butter on my balls.  But it's so low to the ground.  Oh, it manages to get up there.  It manages.  It's hard to get up on anything.  It manages.  So I got that.  I wheeled out the old generator.  A lot of people were asking if I have the Major League giant generator installed.  That takes months to put in.  And fucking variances from the town and giant propane tanks that are buried and things like that.  So, no, that's not in.  But I do have generators to power the house and essentials. 
[00:17:00]  Well, all that should have been in by now.  They're saying this is the greatest storm of our lifetime.  Well, you know what?  What happened?  Left turn.  You failed your people.  No, I got enough generator power.  I'm good.  I'm good.  For how many days?  I'm good for fucking days.  Days.  And then I just got some fucking...  I could get some gasoline.  Well, they were telling our building that they might shut down the elevators.  Yeah, they don't want people stuck in the elevators.  Yeah.  It gets very windy where we live.  And the elevators, on a windy day, you could feel it. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, that's creepy.  You could hear the wind whistling through.  Yeah.  Howling through, as dare I say.  Well, you could actually use that now without it being a crutch.  Howling winds.  Without it being a crutch.  Yeah, so I got people over the house, which is fun and stuff.  It's like some dysfunctional giant family.  We were all sitting on the couch watching horrible crime TV last night.  See, having a family...  People being murdered and stuff.  See, having a family's nice, see?  Yeah, for a few days, sure.  You're getting a taste of it.  Isn't it nice?  This is not a family.  This is just fucking wackiness. 
[00:18:00]  Do you have food?  Yeah.  Got some food.  And brought some food over and stuff.  How do you cook?  You'll be able to cook food?  Yeah, I got, like, propane.  I got the liquid propane that runs everything, giant tank, you know.  I did have my party Friday night, or Saturday night, which was a hilarious, giant, huge fucking  Halloween party.  A lot of people were there.  How many people were there?  Jesus.  It had to be maybe 40. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  40 people.  Damn.  It was a lot of fucking people.  And Eastside Dave was there with the guys from his fucking podcast.  The guy, Roy was his name, I guess?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's fucking playing keyboards.  He brought his keyboard down to karaoke.  And he's playing keyboards.  My brother comes with his guitar.  So karaoke pretty much turned into, like, a fucking acoustic set.  Oh, nice.  And Eastside Dave just singing Guns N' Roses.  Better than Axl, right?  Like, jumping on the floor, rolling on the floor, holding his head like he's injured. 
[00:19:00]  I don't...  He's hilarious.  Of course he is.  He was one of the last few that was still awake when we did our customary end to the  drunken night, 7.30 a.m. Sunday morning.  Honeymoon is viewing.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Mike, this guy Mike was there.  He was a law enforcement officer.  And I've never seen anyone drink like him.  And he just kept bringing me more vodka and orange juices.  He's the guy I know, right?  Yeah.  Oh, he's a drunk.  Oh, is he a sot?  He really is a fucking alcoholic. 
[00:19:30]  I love Mike.  He's a pisser.  You're not hurting today.  No, no.  Yesterday was complete recovery day.  No drinking.  I don't get it, man.  Just fucking hung out.  But that should not be a two, three-day hangover.  No.  You know what?  It was spread out over so long.  And I stuck to one thing to drink.  And I was eating throughout the entire night.  I don't understand that.  Like, there was food everywhere.  Like, sandwiches and then pasta upstairs.  Like, there was food.  It wasn't like a serve-a-dinner thing.  Right.  Food was available all fucking night long.  Jeez, what a group of fucking maniacs. 
[00:20:00]  So, it was good.  It was good for not getting too hammered.  Right.  And then, at some point, I guess Mike thought it would be good to grab his scuba gear, which  he had in his car, and we all just went scuba diving in my pool.  Did you go in?  Oh, fuck yeah.  I was a pisser.  You've never scuba dived?  No, not scuba.  No, no.  Scuba diving rules.  It was great.  He showed me all the fucking shit.  I don't know how many pools in a pool, but.  Dude, it was hilarious. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  We were just in the fucking pool, putting the gear on, and fucking, you know, getting the  belt and adjusting the buoyancy.  And then, I'm just fucking, I'm just crawling around on the bottom of my pool.  It was fucking great.  I think that's highly illegal.  Yeah, whatever.  It was fucking fun.  Did it keep you warm?  You know what?  I had turned.  It does.  I didn't have the wetsuit on.  I just had the gear on.  But earlier in the day, right when I woke up, I had turned on the propane heater and  the electric heater for the pool and the jacuzzi, and just let it run all day. 
[00:21:00]  And the pool was, it wasn't bad.  The top three feet was a lot warmer than the bottom.  Oh, I would imagine.  Like eight feet of the pool.  So when you went in, it was kind of like, oh, this is nice.  Holy fuck, it's cold down there.  Did you lay down on the bottom of the pool and just chill out?  Yeah, just chilled out down there.  How cool is that?  I was fucking, you know, just hanging.  Your brain goes, what the fuck?  I'm not supposed to be breathing under here.  I'm just breathing under water.  This is so strange.  This is great.  Then you pop up, and there was a shitload of people in the fucking jacuzzi, which was  blazing.  It was really nice. 
[00:21:30]  And the weather wasn't that bad, either.  It wasn't cold.  No, it was like six.  High 50s.  So it didn't feel like, you know, you were all that cold.  And then the rest of the house, you know, you get these little groups here in the living  room, the kitchen, and the karaoke thing, and you bump into separate parties that are  going on.  And then we all decided to just pop in the theater and put on Pulp Fiction and do kind  of a who gives a shit who's yelling shit out at the movie.  Drunk session, which, you know.  How many people think they were funny, yelling out stuff? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, there were a few.  Are there any bombs?  Oh, some wicked bombs.  A few bombs?  Wicked bombs.  Yeah.  But some funny shit, too.  It was just a really cool fucking...  Sounds like a good time.  Good night.  Were there any girls there?  Yeah, yeah.  That's nice.  Some ladies.  Hello, ladies.  It was fun.  And then, you know, Saturday, I mean, Sunday comes, and then it's all about this hurricane.  So I had to batten down the hatches.  That was the last blast for the pool, by the way.  I had to drain a lot of the water out.  Oh, that's sad.  I started thinking about the rainwater getting in there. 
[00:22:30]  And then when I looked in the pool Sunday, and it started getting a little murky, and  there's fucking beer cups floating at the bottom and floating.  And then there was like two of those red beer cups just spinning in the jacuzzi.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  People don't take care of your shit.  You know what?  I don't even care.  People don't take care of your shit.  I'm not one of them guys.  They're throwing a nice party.  They should leave their beer fucking bottles and cans out of your pool.  And fucking pitchers or fucking... 
[00:23:00]  It was...  I don't mind that at all.  Yeah.  It was great.  A good time.  But now it's all about battening down the hatches for the big sandy storm when it finally takes  that left-hand turn.  And you don't think it's taking that left-hand turn?  I honestly can't see this happening.  Wow.  No science behind it, but I don't believe it.  You're going out on a limb on this one, huh?  This fucker.  Hello.  Say hello to fucking Maine, Sandy.  Sandy, Maine.  Maine, Sandy.  Really?  Happy to meet you. 
[00:23:30]  Yes.  Ain't seeing it.  You watch.  And you'll see, within the next few hours, I'm saying, you will see them hinting towards  like, well, the latest readings are in and we're not quite seeing.  They'll be like, it's subtle.  We're not quite seeing the turn that has been anticipated.  Not saying it's not going to happen.  We're still seeing, our models are saying that it's going to, but they'll start hinting.  And they'll say stuff like, looks like we might be dodging a bullet. 
[00:24:00]  Dodging.  We could be dodging a bullet here.  That's how they twist that shit.  And then you go, oh, thank God we dodged a bullet.  But they...  Oh, don't let this lull you into complacency.  Still a very dangerous storm.  Dude.  Dude.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  No science behind it, but it's a hunch.  I have a hunch.  That it's not making that left-hand turn.  Right.  This dumb left-hand turn.  Just pushes out to the right.  This is crazy.  Fast forward.  Now there's a video of Anthony with no roof on his house.  I've got a tree on my house. 
[00:24:30]  I've got a tree on my house.  A tree on my house.  I've got a tree on my house.  Well, we'll be finding out soon enough.  We will.  Soon enough.  We will.  They're predicting that downtown Manhattan could see a lot of fucking water.  Oh, that must be what they call Zone A.  Zone A.  Zone A.  I'm Zone B.  Are you Zone B?  If you're keeping track of me.  We Zone B?  We're Zone B, I believe.  Is that bad?  Zone B.  Because we're by the water.  Zone N is what's really bad.  Nah, we're all right. 
[00:25:00]  We're all right where we are.  Yeah.  My biggest problem is if they shut down the elevators, I've got to walk about 500 feet to the fucking  street.  Dude, that's crazy.  Ugh, if I have to.  Well, I'll have to, because I need to be outside no matter what.  Yeah.  I can't.  I can't be cooped inside.  That's why.  No?  Even during the big hurricane?  Nope.  I'll want to be out there somewhere.  Why would they shut the elevators?  They think the rattling will fuck up?  Yeah, it rattles.  Oh, look.  Just on a windy day, it fucks up our elevators.  Dude, look where it is. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, there's the...  No, this is a forecast.  This is a drastic left-hand turn.  This is their forecast.  Look, it's not...  On cue.  They just showed you that it's going to do this drastic left-hand turn.  Oh, stop it with your left turn.  It's a southern New Jersey.  Ain't buying it.  And you're saying what?  Maybe Cape Cod?  Maybe a little Cape Cod brush.  A little Cape Cod action?  And then Hello, Canada.  Oh, my God.  You're crazy.  I would love to be with you on this one.  Where's the left?  It looks to me like it's going right towards New York, or is that after a left? 
[00:26:00]  No, the left is making it where it's not going to be New York.  It's going to be a drastic left.  Right, a drastic fucking...  This is going to be one of those turns that you don't see fucking cars make.  Never mind a hurricane.  It's going to be a K-turn.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to hear skid marks.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We got some storm coverage.  We're going with...  Of course we do.  We're going with the silly shit, obviously.  Oh, please.  As we wait for the storm of the century. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, that's what I was going to say.  So, Lower Manhattan, they're talking about a lot of water.  Yeah.  And they said in 1960, what was it?  Hurricane Diane, I think?  Yeah.  They showed the streets of Lower Manhattan.  Holy fuck.  Flooded?  Water up to people's knees.  Yeah, it was back in the day where, you know, the fucking streets were probably right on the river.  Where they built their, like, retaining walls and stuff.  Oh, you know what?  You're probably right now.  I don't know.  Now they got all kinds of new drainage, gizmos and whatnot.  You think the subways will be full of water?  No, they can't, but I hate, I have such a visceral hatred for fucking, it's going to be too much water. 
[00:27:00]  Are we going to get water on our feet?  We have to close the trains.  Did you see him in his little zip-up sweater thing to look casual, to relax his people?  Governor Christie had a fleece on.  A fleece.  Because he means business.  You know what it is?  No, no, it means...  He's rolling up his fucking sleeves.  I think it doesn't look as official, and he's just one of us, and we're all in this together.  I think that's the look they're going for.  Did you see his boner?  Did he have a boner?  I don't know.  BuzzFeed has got... 
[00:27:30]  You saw it, Sam?  It's on BuzzFeed!  Bloomberg has a boner?  Yeah.  They're trying to figure out if he has a boner.  Was there a cute fucking trooper escorting him?  Yeah, exactly.  In his press conference, under the podium, there's his boner.  Oh, God.  Totally.  It's the same...  Dude.  That's the same shape in the pants Bobo had when he had his boner.  That's every Jimmy boner right there.  Yeah.  When Jimmy says, he's got a rod.  There's even a microphone by it, it looks like.  Yeah, it's talking.  That's not a podium.  What is that?  Yeah, we did that whole bit one day.  That's not a podium.  It's a... 
[00:28:00]  Oh, it's just the top part of the podium.  Yeah, so you could see his pants.  Oh, he has a rod.  He does have a rod.  It looks like he's tenting.  Talk about the storm.  And there's a red arrow pointing to it.  Like, look at this.  Right on it.  Where can the people see this?  Where's Iraq?  Why did he leave his post?  My God.  There he is.  Okay, he's back.  You scared me.  Terrible shirt.  Everyone has to be in their positions today.  If you just Google image Bloomberg boner...  Yeah, could you put that on?  It's on Gawker, too.  And Iraq will put it on our Facebook page. 
[00:28:30]  Opie and Anthony on Facebook will put that up there.  Can we call this...  All day.  We're keeping it real.  Anthony Cumia is saying this isn't making a left-hand turn.  I say relax, people.  You and Ira will be the biggest heroes ever.  This is crazy to think that a fucking storm...  Can I play my Ira?  Oh, please.  This is the guy who shares your opinion.  Yeah.  All right, look.  This is team Anthony.  But you know what?  Ira, in his crazy kind of way, does no weather. 
[00:29:00]  It's his whole life.  Yeah, he...  He...  Yeah, he doesn't look at you.  He's the rain man of weather.  His eyes will wander a bit, but what he has to say is usually pretty accurate.  Iraq, put this on the Facebook page, too, the Ira video.  Oh, yeah.  I saw him after the show Friday in the lobby, and this is what he told me.  The century that's going to hit the...  The storm is going to go out to sea.  It's not going to...  We're going to have winds only.  We're not going to have big rains.  You sure about this? 
[00:29:30]  Yes, I am.  Because they're calling it the Franken-storm.  Ah, the Franken-storm.  It's going to be less than they're figuring right now.  How do you know this?  I know this.  I know this.  I know this like a book.  Like a book.  So, New York has nothing to worry about.  New York has nothing to worry about.  Go about your business. 
[00:30:00]  Go out.  Show yourself.  Go to the casino.  Go any place where you want to go.  But they're saying it's going to be a hurricane, a nor'easter.  Oh, a hurricane, nor'easter.  We get it in July or August.  We never get it in October.  You do realize that we're getting a really bad storm.  We're not going to get a really bad storm.  We're not.  So, Halloween should be okay for the kids? 
[00:30:30]  Halloween should be very, very good for the kids.  Yeah?  Yes.  Are you allowed to give candy to kids?  Oh, yes.  I'm allowed to give candy to the kids.  I'm allowed to give candy to you.  What kind of candy would you give me?  I would give you chocolate candies.  I like chocolate candy.  You know what the oldster likes.  M&M's.  M&M's.  Good.  Good choice.  All right.  So, the Franken-storm is going to be a bust.  The Franken-storm is going to be a bust.  All right, Ira.  Get out.  All right.  Thank you.  You're welcome. 
[00:31:00]  I end my Ira interviews with me looking at his crotch.  Of course.  Ira rules, man.  Somebody on Twitter agrees with you.  Yes.  I'm going on the record and saying the storm will not make the left turn.  They're predicting we are in no danger.  Oh, who's that?  Jim Norton.  Ah, Jimmy!  Stole Anthony's line and tweeted.  Oh, no!  Oh, my God.  You guys are crazy.  I will look smart to people who are not fans of this show.  I am going to fall.  I've stolen Anthony's.  We look really stupid. 
[00:31:30]  To see what happens.  Al Roker.  Even if you have to leave your TV set or you perhaps lose power and you're watching, go to weather.com or yahoo.com.  We are streaming our coverage 24-7 live.  As opposed to looking out the window, Fat Ali.  Yeah, this morning he's right next to the surf in Point Pleasant.  He goes, look, the ocean looks angry.  Administrator.  Of course it looks angry.  That's what it does.  It's the ocean.  It's the ocean.  It gets waves.  I told Anthony, if this was the scene in lower Manhattan, then I'll worry. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  But this is exactly what I expect.  Yeah.  If you're standing right next to the ocean.  And that shit will move inland and people will be flooded out.  They know this.  They're used to this, unfortunately.  They chose to live there.  So, look, there's Manhattan.  Virginia.  We've had that cold air coming in from the west.  She's in Battery Park with absolutely nothing happening right now.  When is it supposed to start making this turn? 
[00:32:30]  Um, now.  When is the next?  Oh, okay.  So, when is the next update?  When is the next big update that will give position, direction, speed?  It's usually every two hours, is it?  I think so.  I don't think it's hourly.  Because hurricanes move so slowly, I don't think they go hourly.  Is there supposed to be a...  It's every three hours.  Eight?  Every three hours.  Okay.  All right, good.  8 a.m.  We have a brand new update at 8 a.m.  We will let you know...  And you're predicting that they might start hinting that...  Dude, if this thing is still moving north at 8 a.m., I'm guaranteeing... 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my God.  It won't fucking turn.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Then I'll guarantee it.  You're usually right about shit.  Because this is crazy.  And then at that point where they say, uh, you know...  Good news.  They'll suck on.  You know, we could...  Don't, don't, don't...  Please, pay attention to the evacuations and everything.  But I'm just saying, we're not seeing the turn that a lot of these models had anticipated.  Oh, boy.  Let's play some of this stuff.  This councilman, was this from this morning there, Sam? 
[00:33:30]  I think it was from yesterday afternoon.  But it was just, uh, he contradicts Anthony's claims quite a bit.  Oh.  Councilman Reed Murphy, you work for the Office of Emergency Management.  He's been tracking this storm all day.  And just tell us at this point, what effect does it look like this storm will have in this community?  Uh, I think it's going to be extremely serious.  A major effect.  Um, I think you're going to see high winds, extreme flooding, more than one tide.  Extreme flooding.  This is not like a, uh, hurricane.  You know, it's going to be a sustained storm.  It's going to sit here for a little while. 
[00:34:00]  I know this community's been hit hard in the past, namely during Irene.  And then you had that big nor'easter back in 92.  But you say you've been tracking these storms since the 80s.  How do you think that this storm will compare to the past storms?  This is only my opinion, but I think this is going to be worse than anything I've seen.  And I, actually, I've seen storms back here, you know, to the 60s.  Wow.  But, uh, you know, we went through a chain of storms in the 80s and then two in the 90s.  Uh, just the whole grade, the wind gradient on this is so large.  And, and, uh, you know, going from a tropical situation and, you know, joining up with a front 
[00:34:30]  just, that's sitting just west of here.  I think we're...  A potentially devastating impact.  Absolutely.  Well, I don't want to listen to a councilman, because what the fuck does he know in the end?  I want to, I want to listen to a meteorologist.  I don't want to listen to Al Roker, because he's the whole, he's into the whole fear-mongering  shit.  Some of the guys on the Weather Channel, the, the older guys.  Yeah.  That they go to in the studio, I'll listen to them.  Yeah.  But all these dopey weather people and these councilmen, he doesn't know. 
[00:35:00]  He says he's an expert.  He has no background on this shit.  He's got as much as me, and I'm saying no left turn.  Yeah, he's watching the news, he's watching the dopey weather people, and then he, that's  what he's saying.  Exactly.  He doesn't know shit.  Correctamundo.  That is a sharp left, man.  I saw the fucking aerial view.  If it just kind of keeps going the way it is, you're right, it's going to miss Connecticut,  it's going to miss Boston.  Oh, it's just everything.  Ah, boy.  Ah, boy.  Al Roker.  I think they're, they're going to need, uh, the, the help of your agency.  All right, Al, relax.  Al Roker is loving this. 
[00:35:30]  All you need to know is Al Roker's right next to the ocean.  That's, that's, that's, there you go.  You know what, another thing that gets me going, every time they show the location of  the hurricane, and then the projected path of the hurricane, right, they have in green,  in the little green line where it's been, and then the little red line where they think  it's going, every time they show it, no matter where it is, the left turn starts exactly  after they're shown where it is.  But they've been doing that for fucking hours.  When does it make the turn? 
[00:36:00]  So if it, when it does make the turn.  They're projecting it every single time.  They're showing, here's where it's been going, north, north, north.  Oh, and then it's turning.  North, north, north.  Oh, then it's turning.  Well.  Well, when it does make the left-hand turn, because I'm, I, I, I believe them this time.  All right.  Probably the only time ever, because I didn't even believe the Katrina shit if you go back  to our tapes.  That's true.  That was a couple awkward days for us.  We were laughing at Katrina.  Of course.  Well, we're afraid of a little thunder, a little lightning, a little rain.  We might have to redo that show one day for the people.  Oh, boy.  What we thought was going to happen with Hurricane Katrina, boy, were we wrong. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  So tomorrow, what do you say?  Like, ah, oh, well.  Yeah.  Whoops.  I was wrong.  Whoops.  Whoops.  But you're not supposed to be right.  I don't have the science behind me.  These people are supposed to be right.  It's a hunch.  And I, I have good hunches.  Uh, breaking storm on Twitter.  An actual weather, you know, Twitter account, by the way.  Yeah.  Because that could also be just some asshole.  But it's, it's actually a weather, weather, uh, Twitter account.  Hurricane Sandy has begun. 
[00:37:00]  It's northwest turn toward the east coast as it continues to strengthen.  I don't see it.  I haven't been told.  Uh, another clip we want to play for everybody.  Man on the street.  The news goes down immediately after Subway stopped to humiliate those still waiting.  This is just like my favorite clip because it was obvious to me that the news went down  like the minute that they knew Subway's weren't going to come anymore.  Right.  Just to be like, look at all these people.  They're not getting anywhere.  Bloomberg.  There's no Subway's coming for you.  Our mayor closed the Subway system at seven o'clock last night. 
[00:37:30]  I thought that was a bit early.  Yeah.  But some saying that it takes many, many hours to actually shut down everything.  And I think they wanted to get people kind of acclimated to get the fuck out of here.  You know, this isn't going to be available.  Well.  Go prepare.  I'll tell you, when I was walking home yesterday, uh, there were a lot of people on the street.  Yeah.  So that, that absolutely inconvenienced a shitload of people last night.  Yeah.  Seven o'clock just seemed way too early.  Considering it's now seven in the morning the next day and you easily could have the 
[00:38:00]  Subways open still.  Yeah.  Easily.  He's a panicky Pete.  Oh, he should have been midnight last night.  Allow everyone to get home.  Nice.  Seven o'clock is bad.  People are still fucking enjoying their, their weekend.  Really?  It's a big boner.  He's just a jerk off.  He really is a panicky fucking woman.  It looks like he's got a big fat cock, like short and fat.  You know, you know, that's probably like the, a little cage.  I bet you his male, his male dominatrix, his, his, uh, they call the master, probably put  a little cuckold fucking thing over his cocks. 
[00:38:30]  We couldn't get a direction.  So he can't touch it or do anything.  Yeah.  Chastity key.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Well, here's, uh, the newsman, uh, going down and just humiliating people.  Yeah.  Shortly after 7 p.m., the city's subway trains completed their last trips of the day.  People scrambled to catch the cars, but not everyone made it.  I tried to, it's coming last time, but I don't think so, it's, uh, after seven o'clock.  I need to go to the, um, Port Authority and I need to catch a bus. 
[00:39:00]  Ran down here to get her, to get back on the train, to get back up to Port Authority.  And I don't think, I don't know, I, are the buses running?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you dummy.  What a bunch of assholes.  They're just dummies.  Who doesn't get the fucking word that shit's going down?  I don't know.  Yeah.  That they're closing the fucking subways.  The subway's closing at seven?  Be there at six.  Right.  You know, you go at six.  Right.  Mm.  There's signs everywhere.  All the subway stations have those illuminated signs over that just says they're closing. 
[00:39:30]  They put up paper signs that say closing at seven.  Who fucking gets there and goes, what happened?  And now all the subway stops are, uh, closed off with that impenetrable strip of yellow  police tape.  The yellow police tape.  Look at that.  Now we, now we got, uh, Bloomberg telling everyone not to stand too close to windows or use elevators.  Just taking care.  Now, during the height of the storm, use staircases.  Avoid using elevators.  You never know when power would go out.  You don't want to be stuck in an... 
[00:40:00]  Shut up.  Depends on who's in there.  If it's you, how you understand, how you'd be stuck with that queen in a fucking elevator.  Let's just stare at an Apple store and see how this, how an Apple store handles a storm  like this.  Why is that?  Like, there's one big window.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a box of windows.  Big fucking glass thing.  So if that could handle a storm like this, then you know a window will never blow out  ever.  Now, during the height of the storm, use staircases.  Avoid using elevators.  You never know when power would go out.  You don't want to be stuck in an elevator, and if you are, obviously our fire department 
[00:40:30]  will come and rescue you, but they've got enough to do, so if we can avoid calling on  them for those kinds of things, they'll be there for real emergencies.  Stay away from windows and close your drapes.  As we said yesterday, flying objects can go right through a window.  Now, Gelforce Winds is something that almost all buildings in the city are built to handle,  but there are old buildings where sometimes pieces of the building fly off.  We think the construction sites are all tied down, and that's not as much of a worry as 
[00:41:00]  some of the older buildings, but if you don't go outside and go near your windows, you don't  run the risk of getting hit.  You'll poke your eye out with that thing.  Yes, that's pretty much what he's saying.  Construction sites aren't tied down.  Stay away from the windows.  Don't run with scissors.  Yes, yes.  How about those cranes on top of the fucking tower that they're building, the Freedom Tower? 
[00:41:30]  That's got to be a scary...  That, like, that shit's got to be rocking up there.  I'd hate to be sitting in that.  Oh, man.  Yes.  Jimmy's sitting on that thing, just fucking rocking back and forth.  I thought you meant while the hurricane was happening.  I do.  Yeah.  Do you think the crane operator's going to be up there?  Oh, he's up there working.  Yeah.  Gotta do, I got a job to do.  Oh, shit.  I'm working.  There you go.  The crane's still there.  How does it stay up there without snapping off?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe they just can't get it down in time. 
[00:42:00]  That's what I like to think.  Oh, no.  I like to think that they just didn't have enough time.  That thing just fucking falling from that height?  Wow.  I'm one of these people.  I want to just see destruction.  Well, everybody's like that.  You think they are?  Absolutely.  But most people don't want to openly say it.  That's why we love events like this.  Because then they feel like a creep, but inside they know they want to see destruction.  Normally, people's lives are quite mundane.  Whenever you get some type of excitement like this in it, people kind of latch on to it. 
[00:42:30]  They want to be part of it.  They want to see something, and they want to be able to tell stories to their friends.  The more destruction, the better, too.  Yes.  And then these big weather events, especially.  News is a perfect reflection of that.  When it snows, I want 10 feet of snow.  Yep.  I'm not relieved when it's only a foot.  Terrible.  I want more, more, more, more.  Yeah.  I think you're right.  I saw him this morning.  He's here? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He chose today to come in early?  Popped in and popped his head inside.  The Radio Wizard is here?  The Radio Wizard has arrived.  With his hurricane gear on?  Well, I've been informed he is, you know, when you guys were talking about casual.  Casual Bloomberg.  Casual Christie and casual Bloomberg with their hurricane zip-ups.  We got casual Radio Wizard.  Yeah.  He got a little fleece on?  Yeah, a little zip-up.  A little zip-up fleece?  No suit today.  He's ready.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I don't know how he got in. 
[00:43:30]  He usually takes the bus in.  Oh.  Let's see what this is saying.  What do people get in?  Where the wind is coming from relative to the trees that are around your property.  All of that because you want to be on the downwind side.  So you've got winds coming out of the north that are moving very, very quickly here early  on this afternoon.  Getting up to gusting to hurricane force in New York City and Boston through the early  part.  You know these assholes.  You see New York City 50 to 75.  Yeah.  75 is the max.  Yeah.  When I was watching this morning before I came in, they just showed 75, baby. 
[00:44:00]  Just 75.  Just 75.  And then they were talking about the buildings in Manhattan and the canyons that it makes  with wind speeds upwards of 90 miles an hour between some of these buildings.  Look out, kids.  Oh, I believe it.  Yes.  I think I tell you all the time, but every once in a while we lose one in my area where  an old person will try to cross the street from where I live to where Jimmy lives.  Oh, that's terrible.  And we get at least more than one, a few a year, where you'll see him start rolling across 
[00:44:30]  because it is the effect of the wind squeezing in between the two buildings.  And coming off the water and the highway.  It's fucking hilarious.  One lady went flying into a flower pot.  She was airborne, though.  It broke her arm.  I was fucking laughing.  My balls were off.  How could you not?  And then there was one person who sent launching.  And one time I did.  I didn't see the lady flying.  They told me about it.  It's legendary around our building. 
[00:45:00]  But I did see the guy rolling across the fucking road once.  That one I did see.  He fell down and then he just started, like the wind started rolling him across.  Completely out of control.  Completely out of control.  Like a barrel?  Yeah, and then he got to the other side and then he got up and just started walking like  nothing happened.  It was amazing.  He must have been so embarrassed.  That's Bernoulli's principle, by the way, of fluid dynamics.  Right.  Whoa.  Yes.  Certain shapes and forms will actually increase the speed of a fluid.  Which air is nothing but a fluid. 
[00:45:30]  That's the knowledge.  Thank you.  That's our knowledge portion.  It happens enough when I know it's going to be a windy day.  I hang out near the door near the security office.  Just watching the show.  With my camera.  Not with my camera.  Of course.  I haven't been able to catch anything on film yet.  It's like trying to catch Bigfoot.  It'll happen eventually.  Yeah, you're trying to catch a New Yorker blowing down the street on film.  Yes.  Yes, I'm despicable.  It's fantastic.  I know it happens.  The security guys know it happens. 
[00:46:00]  They warn...  This is why I love when it happens, for real.  Yeah.  Because everyone is warned.  Warned about it.  And these fucking asshole New Yorkers are like, fuck.  Yeah.  How bad could it be?  That's why I love it.  How bad could it be?  It's not like these people are just walking out and no one's warning them.  Right.  But they go, ah, how bad could it be?  And the security guys are like, all right, good luck to you.  Yeah.  And they walk out there anyway.  Rolling down the street.  I haven't caught one yet.  But I will.  I will.  I'm good for 150,000 views myself on that.  If you get that on YouTube.  Oh, please.  Fucking fantastic, right? 
[00:46:30]  I did see the guy rolling.  That was beyond funny.  I didn't have a camera for whatever reason that day, unfortunately.  Bloomberg tells New York City residents to evacuate, but shuts down all mass transit.  Easy for him with NYPD motorcade.  Yeah.  I think they shouldn't have closed down the subway.  Here, here, here.  Well, here in Lower Manhattan, we are bracing for the storm, which will be coming throughout  the day.  This guy's outside, by the way.  The East Coast, the major metropolitan areas, are bracing for the storm.  His cap isn't even blown off his town.  You see it in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. 
[00:47:00]  I want to go to Philadelphia now and talk to Dave Schrader, who's the communications director  for the American Red Cross there.  And Dave, you have three...  He's got a CNN baseball cap on.  Nothing is happening in Lower Manhattan, so why did the mayor shut this shit down so early?  How is it?  He's a woman.  It really inconvenienced the hell out of everybody yesterday.  Yeah.  As people are out trying to get their supplies, so they needed to have some kind of fucking...  That's a fucking way to get back home.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  I don't fucking know.  I went to the Jets game yesterday.  How'd that work out?  Well, half the stadium was empty because, A, the team sucks, and, B, people are preparing  for this hurricane.  Why would they prepare so far in advance?  And I only go to one game a year, probably, is about the average, and I picked the worst  fucking game.  Dolphins blew them out, I hear?  Dude, it was never a game.  No?  It was never a game.  Did you see Tim Tebow?  A couple plays.  A couple plays?  Tim Tebow?  Rex Ryan refuses to play Tim Tebow. 
[00:48:00]  It's the weirdest thing, and Jets Nation is questioning this.  And a lot of people, if you question this, people go, do you really think Tebow's the  answer?  No, but Sanchez is so fucking bad.  Put Tebow in there just to see it.  It'll excite the hell out of the crowd.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  Is Tebow a better quarterback than Sanchez?  Absolutely not.  But Sanchez stinks.  So put him in there.  And Rex Ryan kept him in the entire game when it was obvious.  Get him the fuck out of there and give Tebow a chance to get some fucking plays in. 
[00:48:30]  What was he doing wrong?  Turnovers?  He just doesn't have the heart.  He's got skills, but he doesn't have the heart of a champion.  He panics all the fucking time.  Is he a panicky Pete out there?  He starts throwing the ball to nobody.  He threw the ball 54 times yesterday.  Wow.  54 times.  That's a lot of throwing.  And I think he had 20...  He chucks it up there.  I want to say 28 completions out of 54 passes. 
[00:49:00]  Just chuck it up.  He just panics.  He's a panicky Pete.  Pete, he's got skills.  He'll march down the field and then have a horrendous turnover every time when it matters.  So we were bored shitless.  I had great seats and everything.  And it was never a game.  Although my in-laws are all Dolphins fans, so they were loving it.  Oh.  Philly guys.  They go back to Philly?  Philly guys that are into the Dolphins.  You figure that one out.  Are they staying in New York for the storm?  No, they fucking... 
[00:49:30]  They laugh at shit like this.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  They stayed right to the end of the game and fucking drove right back to Philly like it  was nothing.  No problem there.  Let's see.  But I had to take trains home, man.  Because I'm like...  Oh, yeah?  I'm like, you guys go.  I'll just fucking take trains home.  Oh, them Jersey trains, right?  Well, there's one that's right outside the MetLife Stadium there.  But then it takes you to Secaucus.  Then you have to wait at Secaucus for a train to Manhattan.  I had to wait 35 minutes in Secaucus.  Oh, my.  It took me two hours to get home. 
[00:50:00]  Jeez.  I could pretty much see my building from MetLife Stadium.  Yeah, but try to get there.  I could see my apartment building.  You got to swim.  You got to climb things.  I'm not even exaggerating.  I could see where I live.  Yeah.  From MetLife.  And it took about two hours.  It would be nice to try to just walk as the crow flies.  I was thinking about walking.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Walking home?  But then I would need a ferry, I guess, in the end, right?  Because you can't walk through the tunnel.  Decathlon your ass home.  I would walk.  Just do it?  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  How far is it?  Seven miles, maybe?  It's a long, long.  If that.  If that.  I can't walk through the tunnel, though.  It's close, but there's a lot of obstacles.  I could see MetLife from my apartment.  You walk over, what, the GWB?  No.  Way out of the way.  Lincoln Tunnel?  You have to pretend you're a car.  There's a blonde car just yelling, beep.  You just go, vroom.  Vroom.  I would walk over the hills of Weehawking down to the water and take a ferry across if  you really need to know.  But, fuck, the Jets stink. 
[00:51:00]  And then Jimmy's Cowboys, man.  They're not my Cowboys.  They are when they win.  Yes.  And?  Romo's a twat.  And I forgot football was being played yesterday.  Yeah.  Tough loss, though, man.  It looked like they had it, and then it turns out, what's his name's hand?  Was that a hand?  Yeah, poor it does, Brian.  But I have such a hatred for Romo.  Even if he won it, I'd still think he was a twat.  Romo.  And my prediction about the World Series was wrong.  What a surprise there.  Not only wrong, really fucking wrong. 
[00:51:30]  Do we have that clip, Iraq?  Not for Romo and not for the Tigers, no.  Did you?  That's a big no-go.  That's no-go.  Why are you here?  Negative.  Because you didn't predict the Tigers.  We looked through the notes.  We didn't find anything.  And we didn't find your Romo thing either.  Oh, no.  I don't want to take this one on.  Can someone else take this on?  Oh, no.  You're saying I didn't predict the Tigers for the World Series?  I will bet you $10,000 right now.  Take the bet, Iraq.  You've got two years back.  But you have to put $10,000 down. 
[00:52:00]  You have to put $10,000 down.  I'm not doing, I'll put 10 and you put one.  You got the money, Eric.  Go for it.  That's right.  Yeah, the negative fortune.  Not only did I say it, I said at least two times, maybe three.  And you sit in that room and you didn't pick up on that.  I have no notes of you predicting the Tigers.  He's the archivist.  Maybe it didn't happen.  D-Rock, comment?  I usually always have his predictions, but I didn't have anything for the Tigers.  Did I predict the Tigers?  I must have been taking a big giant shit when that happened because I don't remember hearing. 
[00:52:30]  No.  Of course you did.  Of course you did.  I said they had a tough, tough year.  So, fuck.  Give them the World Series.  Yeah.  I believe Eric.  All right, Sam.  Wow, Sam.  What a surprise.  Sam's just starting trouble.  He's usually right.  E-Rock, where is this clip, though?  E-Rock?  Clip?  Comment?  I already answered.  Oh.  Didn't happen.  How are you holding up for the storm, E-Rock?  Are you in a red zone or a fucking zone A? 
[00:53:00]  No.  I'm pretty far back.  I'm all right.  Can you say that again?  Pretty far back.  You don't like his shirt?  No, it's not a good shirt.  It's like a Japanese Simpsons shirt.  Is it really?  It's exactly what it is.  He loves cartoons.  It's terrible.  Loves them.  He loves cartoons.  Mr. Sparkle.  Oh.  Someone's given some rub.  Kenny's.  I don't know.  It's questionable.  Uh-oh. 
[00:53:30]  Kenny might have found food.  Kenny foraged.  Kenny's like a fucking one of those foragers.  Kenny, what'd you find?  He's finding things.  Kenny, you were out on the streets of Manhattan.  What's going on out there?  What's going on?  Our man on the street.  What's going on out there?  For Storm Central.  What's going on?  Nothing.  All right.  You heard it here, folks.  Nothing.  No, that's your brain.  What's going on outside?  Oh.  No, what is this?  Why do you think it's not going to be good?  That's egg whites and peppers.  Because we watched the guy make it with his feet.  Where'd you get it? 
[00:54:00]  Like from an alternate deli.  One of those little terrible delis?  Yeah.  There's nothing open.  I don't trust it.  What don't you trust?  And the places that are open, they've run out of supplies, man.  I'm telling you, people were in all these joints yesterday.  I used to be in the trades.  I'm used to eating from real shitholes.  It's only affirmative action.  English is not their first language.  What does it look like?  Open it up.  Let's see what it looks like.  I don't know, but it's obviously terrible.  Look at this.  Let me get Anthony's.  All right.  Ew.  Jeez. 
[00:54:30]  It looks like someone threw up in a metal tin.  It just freaks me out because those little delis, I'll eat food, but I don't want to eat eggs  that are cooked in there.  Why's that?  No, I don't trust it.  But you'll take a sandwich from them?  At least the grill might fucking kill some of that shit.  I've eaten off of those roach coaches.  So I've eaten some real shit in my day.  I'll take your eggs if you're not going to have them.  I'm starving.  Oh, don't worry about the napkins, Kenny.  What else?  What is that?  Let's see.  This is a couple of eggs. 
[00:55:00]  What?  Cooked badly.  Yeah, they cooked them too hard.  They cooked them too much.  Which is good, I guess.  You know, cooked too much is good.  Yeah.  Toast.  Oh, the toast.  It's like they held it under a light bulb for a second.  Yeah, the toast is it.  Bacon.  The bacon looks all right.  The guy was a little overwhelmed because it's like, I guess, the only place opened and  everybody was going in there.  Well, that's why he opened up.  He knew that there was an opportunity there.  But I'll tell you, Jim, those are real egg whites as opposed to like the other places 
[00:55:30]  where they give you the fake egg whites.  What do you mean there's fake egg whites?  What do you mean?  I never knew we had fake egg whites coming into this joint.  Hey, you know, it comes out of the carton.  That's fake shit, huh?  Yeah, it's chemicals.  Yeah, I want them to break.  I want them to break the eggs.  You dropped something.  Hey, that's pretty good.  All right.  Well, fuck.  It's not bad.  There's a little yolk in there.  The yolk's on you.  I get it.  Mine's very bland, but I mean, it's not.  Oh, I got your hot sauce. 
[00:56:00]  Hey, Monday, 6 p.m.  Monday, 6 p.m., it's doing its lefty, but it's still off the coast of Jersey.  This is bullshit.  This fucking thing ain't going to make no turn.  Now, that's Tuesday.  Well, that's Monday midnight.  Okay.  That's showing Tuesday at noon.  No, that's 12 midnight.  Oh, oh, oh.  Monday and then Tuesday, 6 in the morning.  So tomorrow morning, it should be way west of Philly. 
[00:56:30]  Bullshit.  Oh, my God.  So why the fuck did the mayor shut everything down so early?  Because he's a cocksucker.  It looked like everyone could have just went to work today.  Oh, my God.  Fuck it.  He's going to have some explaining to do.  Or will he?  So now they're saying the turn is going to be a little later than they thought?  Well, I saw 6 a.m. tomorrow.  Wait, tonight?  Wait, what was that now?  It said at 6 p.m. tonight. 
[00:57:00]  All right, right.  It's going to be still off the coast of Jersey in the water.  Right.  But I heard it was...  In the middle of its left turn, by the way.  Right.  It's still not making landfall.  I heard it was 6 o'clock tonight.  Kicking in tonight with the high tide and everything and the full moon.  Then it's supposed to be midnight tonight.  It'll supposedly be right over us.  What about Halloween?  That's a great question.  What about the parade?  The Halloween parade.  Halloween's Wednesday, right?  Yeah.  I mean, if this cancels Halloween, it's okay because it's also canceling like two days of school. 
[00:57:30]  Is it okay?  Yeah.  Why don't you come over and explain that to my kid?  Oh.  That they just canceled Halloween.  Is that okay, Sam?  Really?  He'll forget about it in a week.  He's two.  Oh, really?  He's two.  Is that okay?  What's he going to do?  As he's been running and grabbing his Halloween costume every day.  What's he going to be?  Just in anticipation.  Send him out there on November 8th.  He don't know.  What's he going to be?  Buzz Lightyear.  Aw.  Buzz Lightyear.  Buzz Lightyear.  We're in our Toy Story phase right now.  Aw.  Holy fuck. 
[00:58:00]  When does the Toy Story phase end?  It never ends.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Toy Story rules.  Three fucking movies.  I've seen every one 100,000 fucking times.  Are you dressing up with him?  No comment.  I knew it.  Oh, shit.  I knew that was the question.  What are you doing, Woody?  What's up, Woody?  No comment.  Did you get a big Woody costume?  No comment.  Bloomberg had a Woody costume.  Of course he did.  He did.  So you want to come over and explain that Halloween has been canceled?  No.  You just tell him it's on November 4th.  And then what?  How do I get the candy on November 4th? 
[00:58:30]  Just tell him to keep coming to your door.  And, you know, your wife could dress up in different outfits.  And you just give him candy.  You won't know the difference.  We don't have a slow kid.  He's two, though.  He's not that smart.  Although we can Halloween in our building.  Yeah.  Tom was canceled.  Just go up and down the fucking stairs with the kids.  Tom was canceled because he didn't finish his vegetables.  So they canceled it.  Oh, his vegetables.  Just tell him Halloween was yesterday.  Remember?  Remember?  Yeah.  Say we already did it.  No. 
[00:59:00]  I'm sure I could get away with all that, actually.  I have an explanation, by the way, as to why Bloomberg panics so much.  Yeah.  And it comes from my very wise ex-girlfriend, who I was texting with, as she was wondering  why her flight to New York was canceled during a potential hurricane.  You know, even I understand why they had to cancel planes.  Is it the one I'm thinking of?  Mm-hmm.  I love her, man.  Yeah.  She has the best stories ever.  But she raised a good point. 
[00:59:30]  And I hadn't thought of this.  I think I said something about your flight would probably not make it in.  And she said, I know, because he fucking did nothing and a baby died, so now he has  to fucking shut down New York every time it rains.  Do you remember a couple years ago during that snowstorm when he didn't do enough and  everybody fucking complained that he didn't do enough because the EMS workers couldn't  get where they had to go and it was a kid.  There was some shit happened.  But that's why he fucking panics, because he got blamed.  Close it down. 
[01:00:00]  Now he closed it down a day earlier, two days earlier.  It's all about him not wanting to take blame for something happening.  But he closed it down way too early.  Of course he did.  At the very least, he should have kept it open until midnight.  That allows everyone to get home nice yesterday.  I was in a supermarket, and they wouldn't let their workers go home.  And this woman lived in Brooklyn.  And I go, how the fuck are you getting home?  And she's like, well, they are going to drive us all home.  But then they're picking us all up tomorrow because they want this place open. 
[01:00:30]  Good.  Yeah.  But I can't imagine every place is driving their employees home.  You know what?  CVS is all open.  You know, of course.  Can I get my flu shot today?  Because I really need it.  I came in with Dracula.  It'll all be closed.  But, you know, meanwhile, it's nothing but CVS and Rite Aid City.  You know, come on in and buy some wrapping paper.  Yeah.  We got what you need.  That's about it, though.  Starbucks is closed. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, Starbucks is.  But they're not going to make a killing.  Those pieces of shit.  They're not going to make a killing today like CVS will.  Your employees aren't that valuable.  Let's fucking open up the Starbucks.  Got a lot of people addicted to caffeine.  What is she doing with that?  Oh, she's got like an iPad?  Yeah, yeah.  It's just, look, look.  Rain a little bit, just slightly.  But until now, it's been pretty clear.  A cold.  Clear.  We're going to continue to monitor what happens here in New York as well.  Coming up this morning.  She's wearing a baseball hat, too. 
[01:01:30]  That's Soledad.  Yeah.  Who looks horrendous when she doesn't have her makeup on, by the way.  Does she?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's not, they want her to be the cute one on CNN.  Yeah.  And she's not that cute when she doesn't have her makeup on.  My God, there's a world of hurt there.  I think all these places were expecting some action this morning.  Yeah.  And they're all still wearing their baseball caps with no umbrellas.  They really are.  Have it like, you know, kind of perked up on the back of their heads.  So, like, even like an autumn wind would blow it off. 
[01:02:00]  Blow it off.  Yeah.  I really don't think Ant's right on this one.  But if he is, I hope you're right, by the way.  Oh, it'll just be.  It'll be the biggest bust ever.  Hugest.  And then no one officially will ever listen to the news again.  Thousands will die in subsequent hurricanes.  And that's what we need, by the way.  We need no one to listen to the news ever again.  Port Authority spokesperson, Steve Coleman.  He's on the phone with us.  Steve, thanks for being with us this morning.  What is your biggest concern when it comes to the water?  And the subway system.  Do you think that we will actually see them breached with water? 
[01:02:30]  Let's see.  That's to be seen.  But obviously we're concerned.  And we spent all night long putting sandbags in.  You see the hurricane preparedness out front of our building?  Oh, yeah.  The three sandbags in front of revolving glass doors?  Was that it?  Yeah.  Travis took a picture of it.  It's hilarious.  The worst preparedness ever.  The horrid preparedness.  Three.  Three sandbags.  In front of one of the doors.  They're prepared if a beach ball blows up against the building. 
[01:03:00]  It's not going to breach the doors.  And if I owned a business in this area, I would just take their stupid sandbags.  It's every man for themselves.  Fuck that.  Yep.  Yeah, fucking ridiculous.  So I guess they were supposed to be.  I was surprised when I woke up.  I assumed we were going to be in a world of hurt getting in here.  If you'd listened to the news, they were telling you that there will be some flooding  when you wake up in the morning.  So now I'm looking at all these people, these reporters.  I would think there would be somewhere where there was some flooding. 
[01:03:30]  I mean, I saw some roads that had some water in it and I guess Southern Long Island and  some of the Jersey Shore and stuff.  But not this Armageddon-like fucking scenario that they had spelt out for us.  You think they're trying to panic people?  Yes.  Yes.  I bought deli sandwiches home from two states away.  Do you understand?  I have two and a half giant Carnegie deli-sized sandwiches.  I've been trying not to eat bread.  But I was so hungry last night and so panic-stricken.  So you've got to survive. 
[01:04:00]  So there's the fucking...  That's it?  Yeah, there's three doors, by the way.  One of them have four sandbags in front of it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right, E-Rock, he's got that clip now.  You got that clip of the prediction?  Very good.  No.  But now that I've told you that, I absolutely said it and Ant backs me up.  Are you going to look for it or do you decide not to?  There's several days I'll have to go through.  So it's not going to be done right away.  We've got a bare-bones crew, a skeleton crew today. 
[01:04:30]  Isn't that whole sports curse thing kind of a running theme on the show?  Yeah.  And then once again, I fucking fucked it up?  Yeah.  You'd think.  I fucked it up bad.  I think the team really are.  The Giants swept them.  When you make a prediction...  The Giants swept them.  Yeah.  It wasn't even close.  Nope.  Yeah, you were saying you wanted Detroit to win because it'd be good for the city.  I remember that and I don't listen to sports stuff anymore.  Block it out.  I said San Francisco is a good city.  They're okay.  They're in good shape.  So let's give it to Detroit.  Yep.  I said absolutely not.  Oh, they found a lifeguard stand in the water in Mystic. 
[01:05:00]  So that's good.  Oh, wow.  And certainly the people in the region.  If you were to use a sports analogy, this event is going to be more like a...  I got another bet.  I would bet a lot of money.  The guys that are with that asshole fucking put that lifeguard in the water.  Yeah.  I would bet a lot of money and I'll tell you why.  Back in the studio.  All right, Randall.  All the beaches are officially closed.  Most of those lifeguard stands are put away for the season.  Why is it out there?  So there might have been one kind of up against a building like, hey, man, no one's looking, 
[01:05:30]  right?  Put it in the water.  Quick.  Let's put it in the water.  This thing is really...  We don't have anything to talk about.  Because it was in the water in Mystic, Connecticut, but the water was like glass.  Yeah.  There wasn't even a little ripple coming in.  Nothing.  Fucking assholes.  I hope Ant's right.  Ant, if you're just tuning in, says this thing does not make that sharp left turn.  I don't see it.  You know who really panicked?  Who?  Roland.  Oh, God.  Because me and Roland slept in hotels last night.  Ooh, sexy.  Separate hotels.  Oh, okay. 
[01:06:00]  Why did you sleep in hotels?  To make sure we could get in this morning.  By the way, easiest commute I ever had in my life was this morning.  Oh, my God.  This morning.  I carpooled in with Travis and Danny.  Was it a fun ride?  Yeah, it was.  And Roland showed up and he met me here at like six o'clock.  He had a full sign suitcase with multiple changes of clothing.  And then he figured just in case lunch was a problem tomorrow, he had a pound of roast  beef, a pound of turkey, two things of lettuce, some oil and vinegar.  What an addict. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, my God.  He had so much food.  He had two boxes of popcorn.  He had peanuts.  God, he's not going to suffer at all.  What the fuck?  You're supposed to suffer a little bit.  Yeah.  Eat kind of like crappy stuff just to get you by.  And you're in a hotel?  Yeah.  Don't hotels have like room service?  Starbucks was open this morning at the hotel.  It was.  Then why are we getting our Starbucks from there?  What hotel are you guys in?  It's over on like 40th Street.  But I mean, you jump in a cab right now and you get there in two minutes.  There he is. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, Roland.  Oh, by the way, Roland, with all this preparation, just t-shirts, no raincoat.  Well, why bother?  Right.  It's not going to be that bad.  It doesn't rain yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the hotel, you don't have room service?  No, there's no room service.  Why?  Because there's not enough employees.  Oh, man.  My hotel, all the employees, they stay at the hotel.  They don't go home.  Well, you're staying over at that fucking hotel we talked about.  You guys in the same hotel?  No.  What's in a better hotel?  I think they're comparable hotels, but Roland is a few blocks further away because he doesn't know how to book one. 
[01:07:30]  No.  You should have booked, like, the peninsula.  Not a luxury hotel.  The fucking Mandarin Oriental is sweet.  But I think our budget is lower.  No, dude, it'd be funny if you just hand Gary, like, a $4,000 bill for three nights.  The Mandarin Oriental fucking mistake every night.  You know what I would love to see someone hand you a key?  Yes, exactly.  I want to see someone hand Roland a key and say, welcome to the Carter. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, I'd have to stay there.  Oh, the Carter.  I mean, it's still a nice, you know.  It's not a sleepover at the Carter.  Do you think they have bed bugs there?  Oh, yes.  Really?  I say yes.  It's still a nice $250 bill that, you know.  Roland, where's your cold cuts?  They're in the fridge.  And also, I got some feta cheese to punt up myself.  You're not going to suffer, right?  No.  I want to have a full tummy.  So while people are looking for food, I'm like, I'm good.  I'm good.  No one's going to be looking for food.  We live in Manhattan.  Yeah, Roland.  It's not a fucking asteroid. 
[01:08:30]  It's a little wind.  We're going to be fine.  I know.  But if the delis are busy, people waiting in line, I'm like, I'm done.  I got my food.  Yeah.  Just for today.  I hear you.  Yeah, but it's hitting tonight, I guess.  Oh, once it makes that left turn, look out.  Well, the Italians are always open.  So you always got pizza places and Italian food and Chinese food.  And so I got the three things covered.  Oh, you know, the Chinese aren't going to stop working.  Hell no.  No fucking way.  They are amazing.  They'll actually try to put wings on their guys to have the wind blow them faster. 
[01:09:00]  You'll fly with order.  They are not going to fucking close down one Chinese restaurant.  No.  We can guarantee.  Riding bikes the wrong way down 8th Avenue.  They're lunatics.  There's so much food.  Look at Roland's food that just came in.  Roland, look at the size of that pack of roast beef.  I told you.  A pound.  That's crazy.  What are you having?  A dinner party?  No one has that much fucking roast beef.  Well, the guy said a pound.  I'm like, I guess so.  That's insane. 
[01:09:30]  Well, it's for two days or whatever.  How long is that for?  Two days.  It's like a week.  Two days, Roland.  Well, I don't know.  What are you going to fucking put it over yourself if it gets cold?  Like a blanket?  Two and a half pounds.  Oh, I didn't know.  What is it?  It's two and a half pounds.  Two and a half pounds of roast beef.  I saw you coming.  I told the guy a pound or whatever, and the guy goes, I miss you.  I go, whatever.  Just put the sticker on.  Roland is terrible at taking care of himself.  Yeah.  He's the worst.  He's the least independent person I know. 
[01:10:00]  That looks like some nice rare roast beef.  Are you panicking, Roland?  Good shit.  What?  Are you panicking?  Yes.  You know how many text messages I was getting from him trying to figure out what's the plan?  I don't know.  What am I going to do?  I'm going to evacuate.  I don't live in Manhattan.  I know.  Well, they evacuated my building.  I wouldn't mind some turkey.  Oh, yeah, right?  Let's crack that.  That's fresh roasted turkey.  Wait.  Roland's going to be like, no, my food.  I know.  I'll take you a tennis ball for some turkey.  But they actually, you're not allowed in your building?  No.  Or you're allowed if you, but.  Oh, no, they shut down the elevators and locked down everything. 
[01:10:30]  You can leave after 7 p.m.  Fuck are we in Russia?  Yeah.  He's allowed in his building.  He's just not allowed to give out candy to the children.  If you want some turkey, it's delicious.  I would like some turkey in a place.  Roland, why there?  I don't know if we want to get through our rations right now.  Because we're zone A by the water.  Rations?  Yeah, don't move.  Don't start eating through the rations.  You might not want to.  You're right.  That left turn comes.  We're going to need that turkey.  See, you put some turkey, some feta in the salad.  It's delicious.  I can't eat your earthbound.  I don't like the fact that the inside of your fucking salad thing is sweating. 
[01:11:00]  It's like you have old dynamite in there.  It's just creeping me out.  And his salad dressing is like the fancy in the glass bottle with the labels written in cursive.  He's roughing it.  Exactly.  And also have like a 12-pack of club soda, water, and some snacks.  You actually brought better food than Guy Vieri serves at his restaurant.  Oh, the sun's coming up now with that girl that's at the Battery Park.  And it's starting to expose the fact that nothing is going on.  When it was dark, she could like pop her hood up. 
[01:11:30]  And they all talk a little louder into the mic.  Well, we're here.  Obviously, the wind kicking up.  Now it's just like, oh, yeah.  Oh, there she is.  Yeah, now look, the sun's coming.  One or two feet of snow into West Virginia.  All of us meteorologists are like, this is mind-blowing.  Yeah, I think this is the big, for me at least, this is the big wow factor, how far away the impacts will be found and how significant they will be, Stephanie.  I want to take you to the Great Lakes and show you what we think will happen, especially on Lake Erie and Lake Ontario first, and then farther westbound. 
[01:12:00]  Waves, you believe, on Ontario.  That lake's superior.  21 feet with 70-mile-per-hour gust, and on Lake Erie, up to 18-foot wave with 65-mile-per-hour gust.  Now, initially, the winds will be coming in in this direction and pile up the water on the western shore.  All right.  Well, the hurricane came in and we started to sail.  And the queen had a boner under the dust.  By the way, I'm hearing from some of my tattletalers out there. 
[01:12:30]  Not only did I predict the tigers, more than one person saying, I even said, E-Rock, write this down.  Oh, no.  E-Rock.  Could it have been?  Why didn't you write it down?  Oh.  I don't think he did.  He did, in mustard on a sandwich.  So he lost it.  See, because he ate it.  He ate the evidence.  Oh, boy.  Oh, you forgot cheese?  No, you got feta, you said.  No, I got feta for the salad, but different cheese.  Aw.  For sandwiches.  Sandwich cheese, yeah, yeah.  Eric must have written it down on the pay-no-mind list. 
[01:13:00]  Aw, shit.  On that, you know.  Okay, yeah, I'll get right on it, Opie list.  Sure.  Blatant disrespect.  Blatant.  Okay, boss.  Ah, hell.  I'm on it.  Not.  Yeah.  Nailed him.  Totally.  What a break.  We might as well.  I'm going to eat some turkey.  I'm going to eat Roland's rations.  We're a mere, what, 40 minutes away from the latest update on Hurricane Sandy. 
[01:13:30]  Here on Storm Central.  Yes, your Storm Coverage Network.  Opie and Anthony show.  This is where you need it.  Just keep it locked here.  That's what they say.  Keep it locked here.  We just babbled for an hour and a half.  Well, a little over an hour or whatever.  And Ant's saying this thing will not make the left turn.  I don't believe in this left turn business.  And for once, I completely disagree with you.  I don't believe in this left turn business.  Especially with this shit.  We've always been on the same fucking track.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Track, but.  Dude, it's a hunch.  They keep showing where it's supposed to go.  And I think it was supposed to start making this turn beforehand.  They're all holding back.  They're all sitting there going, oh, fuck.  This thing is supposed to turn already.  Well, don't just keep saying it's going to turn.  This is basically a barrier dune that was built back in 1992 after another big storm caused massive flooding in this town.  And as this water gets higher, this dune is in danger of being breached. 
[01:14:30]  He's worried about a dune in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey.  He's got to be embarrassed.  That's what happens down there.  Oh, he's worried about a dune because he's a.  You think he's embarrassed?  Getting ready to come in.  We are going to be dealing probably with some major flooding here.  And again, this is going to be repeated as we move, as Sandy makes its way up the coast.  And again, more than 300 miles away. 
[01:15:00]  You know, I've held off, but I'm going to tweet Al Roker.  Yeah.  Oh, it drives him nuts, too.  He gets right back to me.  He does not like when I point out the obvious.  I'm like, Al, why are you reporting from the ocean?  That's exactly what happens when any type of storm comes through.  And the people down there know this.  It's the ocean.  They know the water is coming over that dune.  They're fully aware.  That doesn't look very pleasant at that point.  When you have these huge weather events, what you want is reporters in areas where this shit doesn't happen. 
[01:15:30]  And then report on what the fuck's happening that has never happened before.  You know what?  When I see the news and what they're reporting, I always go back to one thing I saw when I want to think if they're being honest with us or just sensationalizing things.  Woman in the canoe.  Oh, God.  That right there is the epitome of what these fuckers are all about.  But I think they did that this morning with that lifeguard chair.  Yeah, yeah.  You think they just popped it in there? 
[01:16:00]  What do you think happened?  The storm hasn't even hit Mr. Connecticut yet, and they're trying to tell us that storm surge.  No.  There's not even a ripple in the water up there.  There's nothing happening.  But when that woman was in that newscaster, was in the canoe, and she's got the little paddle, and then two or three guys walked right in front of her, in between the camera and her canoe, and the water didn't even come over the top of the front of their shoes.  It was ridiculous.  I was thinking that's either a bad, like a low bit of water, or they're the biggest giants in the whole fucking world. 
[01:16:30]  Take us out, you no prediction, right in cocksucker.  The OP The Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  I know you say that we're some sick motherfuckers.

It was, I swear to God  About two feet long  Oh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?

[01:20:00]  The Giants win the pennant  The Giants win the pennant  I have no idea  Remember baseball?  Uh, no, it's over, right?  That's it?  Oh, the fucking  That's, uh, that's it?  I guess you've got the Giants and, uh, the Tigers  You've got, sorry, San Francisco, but you've got to push for the Tigers  They have some tough times up there  Give them a World Series  All right, yeah  Give them a World Series  Are they actually in?  San Francisco is a beautiful fucking city  Detroit, not so much  Let's give the World Series to the Tigers  How about we all do that?  The D  Now do you remember that, Iraq? 
[01:20:30]  Iraq  Now do you remember it?  Comment, Iraq, comment  That's not really a prediction, but yes  I remember that  Oh, he refutes  How did you find it so quick?  That was good  He didn't even find it  Travis did  Oh, my God  And Travis found it very quickly  Remember, Iraq said he would have to go through days of shit  Days  Oh, Travis found it?  Yeah  Yeah  How come you didn't find it?  What were you doing?  Looking at your Simpsons shirt in the mirror and drawing it?  WWE fan fiction?  Well, at least Iraq's here today 
[01:21:00]  I'll give him that much  Yes, he is  That's true  Most of the staff is here  Who didn't make it in?  Uh, no surprises who didn't make it in  To be honest with you  We'll go over  Who?  Eric  Wait, who is here that you're surprised is here?  First of all, Sam  I am surprised that Eric's here because  He was  Eric just gave you a side thing  No, only because he decided  He just went like this with his head  He decided to stay in Jersey last night  Which was a risk  Because if there was actually a storm overnight  They'd start closing bridges and tunnels 
[01:21:30]  So he didn't plan ahead?  He didn't plan ahead  But  He got here early this morning  So he lucked out today  But he did wake up early  See, if the storm hit this morning  You still would have been here, Sam?  Because you were planning ahead?  Yeah, I had a hotel in Times Square  Iraq, how do you feel about that?  I wasn't offered a hotel  You don't have to  Yeah, there was an email that was sent out to all of us  That said if you need a hotel, get a hotel  I should have taken one  I would love to hand Gary a fucking huge bill  Oh, man  Yeah, I need a hotel room tonight  Mini bar it  If you need it, you gotta get it  I want one closer 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, I need to be even closer  I don't feel safe  I'm about  I'm less than two miles from here  But I think I need to be closer  I want the Mandarin on 59th Street  That's safer  Yeah, I'll slum it  I'll take the Mandarin  Yeah  Iraq, no hotel room for you  No, I didn't get a hotel room  Why not?  Because I didn't think I'd need one  There's the first  I got a tree on my house  I got a tree on my house  I got a tree on my house  I got a tree on my house  There you go, the first one 
[01:22:30]  Highlands top of trees, there it is  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait  Breaking news  And there you go  It is about 300 miles  So 360 miles away from land  But it is pumping in the moisture  To the D.C. area  The Delmarva  And it's just starting to get in  To places like New York City  And eventually it will continue to climb  North and east  Now, as it takes that westward jog  We're starting to see that little wobble westward  Wobble?  We could see massive power  Outages  And it's hard because  You can't really borrow  From other states  Because everybody needs 
[01:23:00]  Their crews  In order to get back online  Here in New York City  Of course  We do have the  Wires that are underground  And  She's just trying to come up  With something that would be crazy  Oh, I'm just going to look at crazy water  We're starting to see those white caps  We anticipate this water  To rise up  And just inundate  Downtown  Oh my god  People are getting prepared  Not only here in New York City  It's the top of the waves  The little waves  Why do they say that like it's a thing?  Because the top gets foamy and white  Yeah, when it gets white  That means there's some action 
[01:23:30]  It means it's rough water  Oh  A bit rougher than usual  It's like rough water  It goes  Especially when you're not used to white caps  Then you see the white caps  You're like  Oh shit  Something different is happening  Yeah, see the way  It breaks both ways  You either fight  Or surf  You either do radio  Or surf  Or you do neither  Because there's no cabs running today  What?  Yeah, that's true  What?  Hang on  So you got the wobble though  You got the wobble, Anthony  Look  I'm waiting for the 8 o'clock 
[01:24:00]  Fucking update  From the  Yeah  From the actual fucking  People that keep tabs  At this hurricane shit  Not some person saying  Well, we're seeing that wobble  Wobble  Anyone else notice  That they pushed  The big weather tit monsters  Out the door  And brought in  The old school guys  For this one  The heavy hitters  The heavy hitters  Yeah  That they kind of hide in the back  Yeah  All the big tit monsters  Have the day off  Yeah, where are the hot fucking  Weather girls  With the big tits  No  They're gone 
[01:24:30]  You're good for regular storms  But guess what?  Take the day off  We're for a nice  Mellow five day forecast  We're bringing out all the guys  That look horrible on camera  For the next couple of days  We'll do the heavy lifting, honey  Right  Get the meteorologist some coffee  Right  We'll put you back out there  When the sun pops back out  Yeah  Until then  Go get the guy some coffee  Yeah  You know that shit happens  So we rocked no hotel  Yeah, but he did  He was here early  So, I mean 
[01:25:00]  Oh, alright  So you're surprised  E-Rock made it  Only because  Yeah  But that was lucky  Because you think he's lazy  He lucked out  You take the boat in, E-Rock?  What'd you take?  Pretty cool, huh?  I drove in  Oh  I take the boat  The boat  His boat  Sunglasses on  It's fucking pitch black  Ride those white caps  Yes, the white caps  Pulled up to Manhattan Island  Let's ask E-Rock this  What are you doing for tomorrow?  Because tomorrow is when  The shit hits the fan  E-Rock  Tomorrow I will be driving in as well 
[01:25:30]  He's not interested  He's so good to get caught  Oh, boy  And then  Roland was panicky at first  He really didn't know  What he was going to do  But I told him  I'm getting a hotel  I just get a hotel  But he got evacuated  So he had to leave  Right  So he got a hotel  And everything was good  Danny and Travis  Obviously staying with Ant  So as long as Ant gets in  Danny and Travis get in  That's it  My battle wagon  I'll take that fucker anywhere  And that concludes  The assessment of the staff  That got here  Yeah  What, Opie, Anthony, myself 
[01:26:00]  We're here  We're staff  Support staff  Me and Jim made it  That's right, you did  And Club Soda Kenny made it  Oh, wait  There's the fucking  They are mammoth coming in  The guy keeps  They keep going back  To Mystic, Connecticut  With the lifeguard stand  In the water  I'm telling you  They put it there  Someone's got to call him out  The season's over  They don't keep those things  On the beach, really  Come on  Or they would at least  If it was on the sand  They would move it back  Toward the lifeguard house 
[01:26:30]  Or whatever  Yeah, they move easy enough  Why wouldn't you just  We used to move them around  And fool around  With that shit  Just move them back  At my grandma's beach house  Out there waiting wherever  We fooled around  With those things all the time  Between your sugar  And butter sandwiches  I wish it was butter  Oh, right  Just sugar  Margarine  Sugar and margarine, right  Damn it, margarine  I wish it was butter  That would have been  Look, see  Come on  That's not  That's a rowboat situation  I'm telling you  Yeah  Dude, there's no way  They would pull those  Lifeguard stands 
[01:27:00]  And move them all the way back  I like how they keep  Showing it though  They keep showing it  The big thing underwater  There's no white caps there  There's a slight ripple  In the water  In Mystic, Connecticut  Dude, you could skip  A rock across that water  It's fucking perfect  See a reflection in it  But they keep going  In this shot  And the lifeguard stand  Is about 10 feet  In the water  Offshore  So who didn't make it in, Sam?  Well  Who do we got  That didn't make it?  We know  But tell the listeners  From Brooklyn  Subways were shut down 
[01:27:30]  At 7pm  That was announced  In advance, obviously  But Sal  I guess  Figured that  Subways are going to be  Closed at 7pm  What about Manny?  When did you guys  Get the email  You could get a hotel room?  I think  Like  Before noon  So Sal had from noon  To 7pm  To figure that out  Yeah  And get here  And get a hotel room  But old  Pupete hair  Didn't want to  What time did you get  Your hotel room yesterday?  I didn't get it until later  Because I was trying to figure out  Exactly what we were doing  But I had it by 
[01:28:00]  3.34 o'clock  Yeah  Yeah, I mean  That's still three hours  Before the subway shut down  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Dramatic  Just watching some of this  Hurricane coverage  From Point Pleasant, New Jersey  Now the guy's out on the beach  But  And that they're using  A far away shot  Yes  With him  To make it look like  The waves are higher  Than they are  And it's shaking  And he can barely stand up  The waves are giant  But this is not  Everyday life  No  No one  No one in Point Pleasant  Is taking a stroll 
[01:28:30]  On the beach  It does this  So they're showing something  That no one's going to  Have to deal with  Right  You know what I mean  If this was Lower Manhattan  And people were like  Ah, fuck  I'm stuck  And look at these people  They're, you know  They're  Yeah  Deep shit  Then it would be something  What does this prove?  Nothing  It proves nothing  It's so silly  Bracing  Bracing  Anyway  12.26pm  The Gary sent an email  That said  We can put you up  In the city  If needed  So six and a half hours  He had  And he chose to  Say fuck 
[01:29:00]  Fuck the Opie and Anthony show  Yeah  Can we get him on the phone  I mean if he's awake  I don't know  He might have decided  Wow  I don't need to set the alarm today  I'm going to give him  The Mel Karmazin today  Get Sal on the phone  I'm going to give him  The Mel Karmazin  I saw Mel today  I said hi to him  Who's walking around  The hallways today  That's right  I didn't get a big high back  The unanswerable question  Yeah  I'm going to give him  The Mel Karmazin today  I know  It's like the fucking  The guy at the bridge  That lets you cross the bridge  If you answer the question  Yeah  I'm going to give it  To Sal today  That's exactly what  Is he at least awake? 
[01:29:30]  That's unconfirmed  As of right now  What did you  You think you'd at least  Work from home  Or something  Or at least be available  Yeah  I understand  Maybe try to sleep in  But you certainly  Have that phone closed  Just in case the guys  Need you for something  It's not like you guys  Have ever called anybody  Who's not here before  So why would that even  Oh you're right  I guess that  Yeah  Wow Sal's  He's entitled huh  Yeah he's got no kind of work ethic  He's one of those guys  He is such a fucking hipster  Yeah  He's the guy  He's the guy  That I fucking 
[01:30:00]  I can't stand  Who else did make it in  Well  Troy Kwan  Oh boy  You know  Could not make it in  From Manhattan  He lives here on Manhattan  I'm a fan of Troy Kwan's  I really am  But that's a dick move  Yeah  Here's a guy that stays awake  For four or five straight days  Right  But he can't figure out  How to get into  Sirius XM  When a hurricane  Might hit 12 hours from now  Yeah  I mean  He had a legit reason though  Because you said  The email went out 
[01:30:30]  Travis told me that  Troy informed Travis  That cabs would not be running  Well Gary said you could book a car  But the series did the right thing  To get the employees  Hold on  There was  There was talk yesterday  Because I got my ear to the street  In this dumb town  Sure  That the cabs might not be running  Actually  I was in a cab on Saturday  And they were starting to talk about  You know  They're probably not going to do their shifts  But when you at least get up in the morning  And go let's  Well let me see  Maybe there are cabs running 
[01:31:00]  Or  You would find out  There are cabs running  Right  When you find out cabs aren't running  You go  Oh there's not going to be any cabs tomorrow  I have to get within walking distance  To the studio  Yeah  For tomorrow morning  So I'm going to go tell Gary  That I'm getting a hotel  And like  Gary  If you had said  Like he didn't specifically  Reach out  But if you had said  Gary  They're not going to have cabs  And you know  So I'm getting a hotel  He wouldn't have said no  Gary was doing  Everything he could  To get people in  Like he wouldn't have said no 
[01:31:30]  It really is ridiculous  That he lives  Here in Manhattan  It's like  The people that can't make it in  It's because  Mass transit's down  And maybe  You know  They can't get across the river  Or something  They don't have a car  But they live far away  You're getting here from another county  Westchester  Everywhere in Manhattan  Is within walking distance  Actually  More or less  Some are crazy  You know  It's a long ass walk  But I mean  You could do it though  If you had to  Yeah  It would have been a cheap cab ride  This morning  Is he embarrassed  That he's not here  I don't know 
[01:32:00]  There's nothing going on  Let's give him a call  Let's make sure he's alright  Well we do have  A little Sal update  Yeah  Okay cool  I think he's  Snoozing right now  He's not picking up the phone  Sal's not  What's wrong with these guys  Let's give Troy a shot though  I'm sure he's probably  He's probably just checking out  But do you understand  With Troy  Like the guy will stay up for days  And he's all about  Being crazy and wild  And just going with the flow  Well he's ready to tell you  He's a hustler  For that DJ lifestyle  I mean he'll get  Whatever job you got  He'll do it  He'll stay up late  Uh oh  You know what I mean  North  Northwest 
[01:32:30]  At 20 miles an hour  The 8 a.m.  Just in  Winds at 85 miles an hour  North  Northwest  So it did wobble  Wait a minute  So before now  It was still moving north  Pure north  But officially it's now northwest  Now it's  No no  Now it's north  Northwest  Which is between  Which is between  Are you still holding out  On the left turn thing  And northwest  You opened this show  By saying it's not  Making the left turn 
[01:33:00]  What are you saying now  Anthony Comey  At 8 a.m.  Or just before 8 a.m.  I certainly don't think  It's going to make this  Fucking crazy left turn  That they're saying  I think yeah  We are seeing  A bit of a deviation  From north  Well the model  They just showed on  The weather channel  As you were saying that  Yeah  Shows a drastic  Left hand turn  Crazy left  A turn you couldn't make  With your car  Yeah  Yeah  North  Northwest  Is um  It's like this  It's not west 
[01:33:30]  It's this  Yeah  It's like uh  It's in between  North and northwest  It's kind of like  North and northwest  That would be like  754  Yeah  Maybe even seven  The big hand  Yeah  Look at the clock  It's almost like  Where we are right now  That's north-northwest  The big hand  Maybe 755  That's like northwest  That big hand  Right now  No  North-northwest  Is probably the 11  The CNN lady  Is standing there  The fucking leaves  Aren't even moving behind her 
[01:34:00]  I know  I know  And you know what  I blame them  Because I completely believe  That we're going to be  In some shit this morning  And we're not  Yeah  So they probably knew  This thing was going to hit  A little later than it is  And  But they didn't want to  Tell anybody that  That's not a good story  Let's go to the phones  Why do you have Troy  Lit up on the phone there  I guess he's sleeping in too  Yeah  Did they try him  Oh yeah  We just called him  That's why he thought  There were no cabs running  He didn't wake up 
[01:34:30]  To check  Storm  This guy is with Anthony  He doesn't think  There's going to be  A left-hand turn  Mark in Queens  Yeah  How's it going guys  Hey  Yeah  I'm in Jersey right now  It's kind of raining  But I studied weather  In college  And  And from what I'm seeing  Is  Is that  The jet stream  Dropped below  Northern New Jersey  And there's an  Arctic wind  Coming in from Canada  Doing southeast  And it's going to  Push the storm  Out to sea 
[01:35:00]  Oh  Cause you were  Studied weather  In college  Yeah  Yeah but he had  All the factors  I gotta give it to him  I bet he studied  The inside of his eyelids  This guy  If you want to sound like  You know what you're  Talking about with weather  You just fucking mention  That jet stream  Jet stream  Dipping south  You know just go  Jet stream  Dipping  It's dipping south  And  And there's an  Arctic wind  Coming from the southwest  Over Lake Erie  And all the Great Lakes  And it's pushing  That jet stream 
[01:35:30]  South  And the jet stream  Will push that storm  Out to sea  Alright let me  Thank you sir  What about the  High pressure system  Oh shit  There ain't no  High pressure system  The high pressure system  Is off the  Coast of Canada  Yeah and that's  Supposed to shove  It's circling around  But it'll push  It'll push the storm  High pressure beats  Low pressure sir  Yeah  Every time  I don't believe it either  I'm just saying  There is a high pressure  System there  I don't believe it though  Alright  I think we're gonna see  This fucking thing 
[01:36:00]  Go north  Northwest  And then the next one  Three hours from now  You're gonna see  Complete east  And England  Will be bracing  For the hurricane  England  That's my prediction  That's my prediction  Alright sir  Thank you  Yeah alright  Alright let me go to Dan  Dan  Hey  Have you ever been  Called the man  Yeah  By the way  How about Dan the can  Hey guys  How you doing this morning  Hi  Hi  Hey  I live down here  In Florida  And so I'm 
[01:36:30]  Well experienced  With dealing with  These storms  And I heard  Anthony talking  About how dramatic  These weather people are  And I've seen it  First hand  I got one of these  Jobs where I'm out here  In the middle of a storm  And there was a hurricane  I was Hurricane Dennis  In 2005  And the weather channel  Was doing a shoot  Anyways  These idiots were out there  And the wind is barely blowing  And they're out there  Doing their shoot  So to make it all dramatic 
[01:37:00]  For their shoot  They've got  One of their crewmen  That's standing off  To the side of a sign  And they are  Wobbling this  Sign as hard as they can  Trying to make it look like  The wind is blowing  This sign  And making it as dramatic  As possible  It was the absolutely  Most ridiculous thing  I've ever seen  Weren't the people  Able to see the sign  Being wiggled  I don't know  No you can crop that out  In a shot  Oh you think like  Down low  And they're  Oh whatever 
[01:37:30]  Yeah  Okay  Alright  I got you  Exactly  You can absolutely  Crop  See an arm in there  Yeah  Wiggling  I believe this guy  Yeah  Yeah  It's just crazy  But  The funny thing was  When this was going on  That wind was very  Maybe 10 or 20 miles an hour  That's the funny part  But I figured  I'd share that with y'all  Thank you sir  Thank you so much  That was terrific  Dan the man  Yeah he's by a bridge  He's Dan the span  He's at Anthony's house 
[01:38:00]  He's Dan the clan  Alright well  We're almost ready  To move on  To regular material  I thought we were  Going to just do  Storm coverage  Well you know  When something changes  We will be here  Just so keep it locked in  With us  Your storm coverage  Kenny  I have an update  Alright  Kenny's got an update  You found food  It is now drizzling out 
[01:38:30]  Oh  And there's price gouging  Going on  Price gouging  That's a lead here  Where  Well  Normally a banana  Costs 50 cents  But today  One dollar  Ah shit  Wow  Did you say something to them  They don't understand English  Oh boy  It'd be nice to at least  Get like some  Troy and Sal  Phone call  Man on the street  Type of deal  That would be nice  What's going on  In your neighborhood  We would have been able  To waste 20 minutes  Calling those guys  Not only do they  Not show up  They chose to sleep  In my fucking  Jerk house 
[01:39:00]  They're not even  Listening to the show  Man  Ah those guys  Got it covered  My stock in Troy  I'm a fan of the Troy  If you need anyone  To pick up the slack  But he's supposed to be  The wild guy  Exactly  He doesn't sleep  For days on end  He doesn't have a TV  Man  Man  But a little wind  And it shuts  His whole life down  Maybe DJing  In the Opie and Anthony  Show shifted  Maybe the old day job  Has become his little  Side project  Little side gig  Because from looking  At his Instagram  And stuff  He's out  Partying  Stuff all the time  I guess now 
[01:39:30]  Would be a bad time  To bring up  His foreseeable future  Thursdays  What's that  Did you know about that  No no  He's off for the  Foreseeable future  Every Thursday  That's true  What do you mean  Remember the Steve  Foreseeable future  It's kind of funny  Troy picked Thursdays  Troy went for Thursdays  For the rest of the year  He's off every Thursday  He's just taking  Every Thursday off  For the rest of the year  Yeah  Alright  I bow to you guys  I don't know how  You got it done  But  It's amazing  I think the staff  Gets more time off  Than we do  It really is amazing 
[01:40:00]  I don't know how  You guys figure that out  I don't get it  God bless you  To Troy's credit  He's not making  Any secret about it  It's not like  This is like a thing  He's doing  But he's just like  Yeah I'm gonna go  For every Thursday  I guess  Foreseeable future  Alright we got some  Calls coming in  Saying thanks  To Owen A  I see through the  Bullshit  Ditchbanger  Morning boys  I'm here in  Central Pennsylvania  If you can hear me  Okay  The wind's blowing  About 75 mile an hour  Right now  Wow  I doubt it  It's real  Oh wait a minute  Let me put my window up 
[01:40:30]  Alright  Let's see  There's nothing going on  We get it  Well  But here  I mean  I'd like to report  The first accident  Though out here  Resulting in wind  Is I misjudged  When I jumped out  To take a piss  There a little bit ago  And I accidentally  Pissed on my boot  A little bit  He's got a lot  Of material this guy  Yeah I like the bit  He's right on it  Do the bit  Do the bit  Thank you sir  No I mean  But to keep it real  Yeah we're gonna get  Hit with something  I don't know  If it's gonna be  As bad as they  Are saying  They certainly 
[01:41:00]  Lied about when  This thing was gonna start  Yeah  Cause I was fully prepared  To have a wild  Ride into work today  Indeed  And there's absolutely  Nothing happening  Until a little later today  Nothing  Seems to be later  And saying that  The left hand turn  He doesn't think  He don't buy that left  He's not buying it  He don't believe  It's not buying that left  That crazy left  Yeah the shit is  Absolutely hitting the fan  But you wonder  To what extent  Cause we read  The Chad Myers tweet  From a couple days ago  Chad  Where he said  This is the most  Unbelievable thing  He's ever seen  And now 
[01:41:30]  I don't think  He would  Tweet the same thing  Two or three days later  Do you know  Do you know  What that means  When all these  Weather guys  Are saying  That they  This could be  The worst storm  They've ever seen  You know what that means  You know what that would  Look like  Yeah  The worst storm  You've ever seen  Yeah  Come on  Did you find the  Piers Morgan clip  Where he called  Them out on it  No it's not  Posted on the website  That I saw  It's too bad  Cause it's classic  Cause then Chad  Goes well  You know  It's Twitter  And you tweet  What you're thinking  At the time  And at the time  That's what I was thinking 
[01:42:00]  Is he  What's his name  On Twitter  Chad  Meyers  That he might  It'd be fun to follow  Chad  With an S  Just put Chad Meyers  In the search  With an S  Chad Meyers  CNN  There you go  When Ann Coulter  Fucking owned  Piers  On the show  I love how she's  Not backing down  It's fucking great  He tried to call her out  On using the word  Retard  I got it  We could do that  Yeah  Really  Hold on one second  Before you move on  The Chad Meyers thing  Go back to his Twitter  Chad's Twitter  And then we'll move on 
[01:42:30]  To the Ann Coulter stuff  Cause it is worth  Playing today  Read some of his  Last few tweets  On this whole thing  What's he saying  Not too much has changed  In the past few hours  This is a very big storm  Tens of millions  Without power  Landfall locations  Still a question  Tens of millions  Tens of millions  I'm gonna call this guy out  By Wednesday  Without power  What else  Let's see  What was his last couple  Of tweets  These are all replies  To people  So  Yeah  He's talking about  You know 
[01:43:00]  We may lose water  We may lose power  Water  There's also a blizzard warning  In the same area  Watch out  What a panicky picture  It really is  Chad  Oh Chad  It's obviously  The harp system  In the path  Time to charge phones  Turn freezers  To coldest setting  Fill your tub with water  Get a flashlight ready  If you don't believe  President Obama  Used harp  In order to take  The heat off  Benghazi  Then you're an idiot  Did he? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah that Benghazi  Gets swept away now  And this guarantees  His re-election  By the way  Yeah?  Yeah  Why?  People don't like  Changing presidents  When weird shit's happening  Weird shit  And this is weird shit  How many swing states  Are being affected  By this huge storm?  That's the cute  Funny looking girl  In the weather  She's a Kate May  What's that?  How many?  How many swing states  Are being affected  By this storm?  Just a little piece  Of Ohio  That's it?  Oh  A little bit  17 member  Distressed crew 
[01:44:00]  Off North Carolina  Waters  Alright  So nothing more  On the Chad Myers  Hurricane Hunter  Aircraft just found  Flight level winds  Of 111 miles per hour  That's a thousand feet up  But  This is the highest  Wind in days  Is it a thousand  Or ten thousand?  Does it mean  The highest wind velocity  Or the highest wind  At a thousand feet?  Ten thousand  Ten thousand  Oh at ten thousand feet  Yeah  Of course it's windy up there  Jesus  Kenny could have told us 
[01:44:30]  That with the top of his head  See because he's tall  Yes  Because there's nothing  In between his ears  To stop it  So he hears a whistle  Before we do  Oh Kenny  Sometimes on a windy day  If Kenny and I  Are sitting next to each other  I'll just hear  Sorry  He turns his head sideways  Sorry about that  I just got a tweet  About Troy Kwan 
[01:45:00]  Oh  Troy Kwan is down  For whatever  Whatever bro  Troy Kwan is down  For whatever bro  Except inclement weather  Yeah I mean  If there's a threat  Of possible rain  He doesn't want to  Is he going to be embarrassed  Or do these guys  Don't give a fuck  To the point where  They're like  Eh whatever  It's hard to feel embarrassment  When you're warm  Under your covers  I'll tell you that much  Yeah  But it's 8 o'clock  Oh please  That's still early  The show's half over  And there's  Look the guys are still  Wearing their baseball caps  Out there  It's still early  Do you think that  Troy went out last night  Knowing that he wasn't  Coming in  Oh hells yeah  You think so  Yeah 
[01:45:30]  Check his Instagram  Any pictures of  Fucking transvestites  And people skateboarding  I didn't post  Oh  Owning  He lives in a cool area man  He's getting some good  Instagram pics  Yeah  Really  I think so  Cool area  Yeah it's cool down there  Lower east side  Is like old school New York  He's got plenty of time  To get out there  And take them  How cool is it  For a 40 year old guy  Oh  Oh  Lemonhurst got some water  Ready  Oh wow  They found a puddle  Holy shit  Let me go down to that 
[01:46:00]  Over here  Over here you see the creek  The harbor  The boats are rising  Clearly they could just  Come right out of their moorings  We're joined this morning  By the supervisor  Of the town of Babylon  Richard Schaefer  And Mr. Schaefer  Can you give us the latest  On the conditions  In your town  So the latest  By the way  As they have this dramatic shot  There's a car driving  Driving through the puddle  So this guy's wearing no hatch  As Sandy moves  Well still early  To the shore  And we're asking residents  To evacuate now 
[01:46:30]  When they can  We put a mandatory evacuation  In effect as of yesterday  Because we wanted to  Look at those boats  Aren't even moving  No they're coming out  Of their moorings  Oh look out  The conditions are going to worsen  And pretty much  Your barrier island  Spire island  By the way  My point again  Amazing  This happens to Linenhurst  All the fucking time  Yeah  And the people that live there  Know this shit is going to happen  From time to time  Right  And they deal with it  They make it look like  It's the great shrimp  Shrimp boat massacre  We're going to have 
[01:47:00]  The only shrimp boat  If they all leave  Their moorings forest  I hope my titanium legs  Don't get wet the rust  Then my fat Asian wife  Who sings Gangnam Style  Won't be able to come back  Gangnam Style  Gangnam Style  What do you got Danny  Danny ran in here  Just about  You were talking about  That area  You used to live in that area  What's that?  You used to live down there right?  I still live there now  It was funny  We were watching the news last night  And it was just an excuse  To have all the local officials  Parade out onto the news  Because it was like  Alright we have the mayor  Of Linenhurst here 
[01:47:30]  And then he comes out  And he's all smiles  And he's like  Oh my TV  And then he has this little segment  And then he's like  He's like  Alright we're gonna throw it  To like the chief  And then like the fire chief  It's just like  Nothing's happening  And they don't know shit  It's drizzling outside  But that's a dramatic shot  If that was an area  That that usually doesn't happen to  And if it was a huge area  It was an intersection  That's Linenhurst  That happens all the time  When you get these storms  And people know it  But they sacrifice that  Knowing they want to live  In that area  And look 
[01:48:00]  This idiot right next to the ocean  Yeah that's what's gonna happen  When any type of storm  Comes rolling through  Why is that dramatic  Someone explain it to me  Please  They love big waves  And wind  The guy's on a sand dune  At a beach  With an angry  Surf behind him  Yeah  That's what happens  It's pretty cool  Those waves  It looks cool  But it's you know  It's what happens  Yeah  But the coastlines  They're used to this shit  They're warned of this  All the time  Breaking news  Tidal surge in Ocean City  Beyond that fence  Where a beach was 
[01:48:30]  And now it's completely  Covered with water  We are seeing flooding  That's why it's a beach  Here  Yes it's been doing that  For millions of years  The sand is getting wet  It happens a lot  Dummy  Troy Kwan  Hey what's up  Hi Troy  Oh Troy what up  Troy you know I'm a big fan of yours  You know that  Yeah  Why aren't you here  Well  Last night  I sent everybody an email  Saying look  The trains are shut down  How am I going to get up there  And  There was no car services  There's nobody  The taxis weren't running 
[01:49:00]  So it was like  What do you do  Well the cabs are running  You know that  Well I went on  There was some taxi websites  I was trying to have one  Ready for me tomorrow morning  And they weren't  I saw  I started counting them  I saw 10 cabs on the way  From my house  Which is less than 2 miles from here  What's the taxi website  You know why they're running  Because there's nothing happening yet  The storm's going to get worse  Probably  I don't know  Early afternoon  It's really going to start kicking up  You sure you weren't looking at a website  For the show  The taxi website  But Troy 
[01:49:30]  You're always down for whatever  Wouldn't this  Wouldn't this come into play  Yeah  I mean  I would've  Came in last night  I mean  Rob even said  He was going to pay for a car  To make sure that I was in  And there was  No car services  Running at all  But today  There was a couple  That were completely  Book solid  Is your longboard running  But if you're down for whatever  Let's get back to that  Because I think it takes  The whole fucking  Out of your  I'm down for whatever bro  DFW  Wouldn't you like just 
[01:50:00]  Hey I'm going to fucking  Hitchhike to work  Fuck it  I don't give a fuck  But I'm going to get there  Well I'm not going to  I'm not going to  Kill myself to get into work  I mean  Well I don't blame you for that  To be honest with you  You just diffused it  You don't have to  Yeah  But I'm just thinking  The guy that's  Down for whatever bro  Would be here  Or you could get a hotel  In the afternoon  Yeah  There was a hotel option  That went out  Yeah  I mean  I had stuff going on last night  So I couldn't get up  To the hotel  And then how do I get  To the hotel  In the evening 
[01:50:30]  If the trains aren't running  Couldn't cancel  Last night's plans  Sam's implying  That you had other plans  Last night  And Sam's definitely  I was actually in bed  Early last night  Sam's definitely implying  That it would have been  Very easy to get here  Yeah  Yeah  Well I mean now  Now we know that  But last night  When the trains were shut down  It's easy to say that now  Yeah  I wanted to come in  And I had every intention  Of coming in  And Rob Cross  Was kind enough  To say hey look  I'll make sure  I'll buy you a car 
[01:51:00]  To make sure you're there  And I had  Called to a couple  Different places  And there was just  Nothing available  What time did you get up  This morning?  I got up about  Maybe 45 minutes ago  Wow  Still plenty of time  To get in here  For the second half  Of the show  Hopefully  Although you could have  Woken up at like  Five and just seen  What was going on  You think he could have  Stepped outside  And seen if some cabs  Were driving by?  Theoretically  I mean it's a possibility  It is Manhattan  Yeah I could have  But the trains  Were running that 
[01:51:30]  I'd rely on  Public transportation  Yeah  I don't have the cash  To front for that  So  Now they would have  Paid for your cabs  You have the cash  To front for that  These guys suck  But they don't suck  That bad  No  I mean they want you  To front it  They don't want to  Make sure you have  A car there  No car  Even came in today  He's here now  Early  We haven't seen  E-Rock got here early  We haven't seen  Mel Karmazin in years  And he's even here today  He's taking attendance  Seeing who's here  I texted Travis last night  I said if there's  Any other alternatives 
[01:52:00]  Any other ways  I can get in  Please let me know  I'm afraid  Did you get up early  Just to try it out though?  No I didn't  No  I didn't hear anything  I walked outside your apartment  And go let me see  What's going on  Yeah  I had my phone on  And I didn't hear  Anything from anybody  It's the word on the street  Yeah  Yeah  I emailed the bosses  And said I'll be more than happy  To come in  Bruce?  Tell me how I get in  Alright  Do you feel at least embarrassed today?  No  I'm chilling  There's no rain 
[01:52:30]  Not much wind yet  All the reporters are still wearing  Their baseball caps  I was selling kites on the way in  And didn't do well  Because the wind's not kicking up yet  It wasn't strong enough  My kites were just being dragged  On the ground  My kite factory had to close  Alright Troy  Enjoy your day off  I mean there were  There were  Hotels  Available  Like within walking distance  What about tomorrow?  Yeah  What about tomorrow?  What about tomorrow?  Tomorrow's gonna be ugly  Well 
[01:53:00]  I mean  How do I get in?  Who can come get me?  How do I get in?  There are cabs outside  The yellow cabs are always running  How do I get in?  That's a very good question  You could take a cab  If you take a cab  If it's the middle of a hurricane  You want me to go out  And risk  Trying to hail a cab  No you take a cab  No we're really talking about today  Where there's no risk whatsoever  You take a cab now  You should have grabbed your longboard  And fucking  You know  I'm down for whatever brah  And longboard it'll work  That would have been cool  Like holy fuck this Troy 
[01:53:30]  Look how he got in  Yeah  That's a superstar  And I also  I think if  If E-Rock hadn't made it in  And Troy had  Oh yeah  Then Troy would be feeding E-Rock  A shit sandwich  For not making it in  Oh fuck yeah  Are you embarrassed  That E-Rock made it in  And you didn't  That's a very good question  No E-Rock  E-Rock drives in  And E-Rock  And E-Rock could easily  Come and pick me up  Yeah E-Rock  Why not  Why not offer  That's not  It's not a good question  Why they used to be pals  Because Troy probably didn't ask him 
[01:54:00]  E-Rock  E-Rock  I had no idea  What Troy was doing  Wow you guys used to be pals  Maybe be on the same page  Like hey  How are you getting into work  I'm gonna drive  Can you pick me up  Yeah sure  Sure pally  I'm there  Yeah  Alright  Well like I said  Like I said  I texted Travis  Last night  I said if there's any other way  That you can think to get in  Please let me know  And they're showing the lifeguard  Staying in the water again  And of course they leave it there  Because they need it  For their dramatic shot  Looks like it's getting deeper 
[01:54:30]  In the water  Yeah the water's rising  There's gonna be some shit  Yes of course  Alright Troy  I just gotta say  The next time you say  I'm down for whatever bro  There's no way  It's not gonna have the same  Oomph that it  That it has had over the years  Alright  I'm sorry guys  It's alright Troy  At least you picked up the phone  Trust me  Sal's on the line  Oh good  Okay good  Thank you Troy  I do  Enjoy your day off  Your free day off  You bastard 
[01:55:00]  Oh man  Sal  Hey what's up guys  You know how bad  You suck today  Why is that  Everyone's here  It's not even raining yet  Nothing  This was no different  Than any other day  The reporters all have  Their baseball caps on  I'm looking out my window  There's hipsters  Going down the street  And kayaks  Is that supposed to be a bit  No it's not a bit  It's um  There's not one hipster  In a kayak out there 
[01:55:30]  There's not one hipster  So that means it was a bit  There's a bit  There's no water in the streets  Good bit  It's not raining  Kind of like the bit  It's not raining  Not raining at all  Everything's fine  So being the new guy  The new guy should absolutely be here  There's no way I can get into the city right now  You could have taken a cab  What cab?  Yellow cab?  There's no yellow cabs on me  And all car service  They're completely booked up  Did you go outside your apartment today  To see if there were yellow cabs running? 
[01:56:00]  Uh, no  The phone call I got a couple minutes ago  Was me waking up  Everybody's like  There's no way I could have made it in  But they're waking up at like  7.30 and 8 o'clock in the morning  I couldn't make it in  Because I was asleep  Yeah, of course you can't get here  You were asleep  And you could have got a hotel room yesterday  And I gotta  I gotta say this  There was a part of my brain going  I don't know if  I don't know if I'm gonna make it into work tomorrow  I got up  And then I didn't see like  A text from Kenny saying 
[01:56:30]  Look, I can't get in  It's a fucking mess out here  Because even if he said that  I would have  Still walked out of my building  And said, okay  How the fuck can I get to work?  Right  Is there a car outside?  Is there a cab running?  Maybe  But you chose  To sleep in  Of course  I guess  The only other alternative  I would have had  You know what?  I want to fast forward 10 years  And see what happens  To all these entitled assholes  What happens to them?  You're being harder on Sal  Than you were on Troy  And Sal 
[01:57:00]  And Troy  Is actually in Manhattan  You know why?  Because Troy  Like he's 40 something now  Sal  Like as a kid  What is he thinking?  You know what drove me crazy about Sal?  It's amazing  There is a difference by the way  Sal is just starting out  So  Like when I was starting out  In my career  I did whatever the fuck I could  I left here on Friday  Because this was very talented to me  I kind of all came together  Why  Because I like Sal  As a human being  I think he's a good guy  But it all brought together  Why I get annoyed with Sal  So easily  On Friday  I left here at like 1.30 
[01:57:30]  Right  Which is  I usually leave later than that  But I was done  And I was going home  And  I always make fun of Sal  Because he always tries to leave early  Because they told him  When he got hired  To be here till 2 o'clock  Uh huh  And he always tries to leave  At like 1.30  Or 1.45  He tries to sneak out  Yeah  And so I always kind of  Just joke and be like  Well Sal  You're needed here till 2 o'clock  And then he leaves  And it's whatever  But  So he tried to do  To me  What I did to him  And I looked at him  And I was like  You think  During my first year here 
[01:58:00]  I ever left early?  Oh my god  Never  I mean  I'm putting in the hours now  You know I was doing my first year here  It's killing it  Crazy  I don't even blame Sal  Because he has no clue  Because it was the way he was brought up  Yeah  These entitled kids  Have no fucking idea  What they're doing to themselves  It's expected of them  To have days off  Right  And you're crazy to question it  Sal  You should have been here  You could  They offered a hotel room yesterday 
[01:58:30]  Yeah that's the thing  At 12.25 in the afternoon  We have a hotel  They offered to pay for your way in  Whether it's a cab  Or a livery guy  It is Manhattan  And there's opportunities out there  By the way  So if the cabs aren't running  That means these other fucking idiots  Are going to be out there  You know hoping to pick up  Some rides  Why didn't you take the hotel  In New York  That would have been a great  I would love to have done that  If I was you  It was awesome  Yeah I guess it would have been cool  But then that means  I would probably have to stay there  For like  Like probably  Like two three nights  Right  So  Oh my god 
[01:59:00]  You just proved my point  Exactly  When I was a 20 year old kid  If I had to stay in a hotel  For three or four days  For my career  I would have done it  Party  Right  You hear what he just said  That's all you need to know  Right now Jess and me  Are theoretically stranded  In New York City  Until you guys decide  You're not doing a show anymore  Because Jess is here  Like just hanging in Manhattan  Because we're not going home  Yes Sal  That means you might have to stay  In god forbid  A hotel in Manhattan  For a few days  Wow  How bad is that  In dreary old Manhattan  Yeah I guess 
[01:59:30]  I guess it does sound pretty good  In how I think about it  I'm having a good time  Sleeping in my own bed  And all that sort of stuff  You're having a good time  And then when your career  Doesn't unfold for you  Then you know  Don't blame  Don't blame me  Like other assholes  That used to work here do  You know how often  I've had a good time  In the last seven years  Never  There's not been  One good time  Tell us how many times  You've caused other people  To have a good time  That's right  In the end  You're in control  Of your own fucking destiny  You're blowing it 
[02:00:00]  Right so I chose  I chose to stay home  That was my choice  Well good for you  But when like  No one wants to hire you  Because they think  You're a slack  Don't fucking blame us  I never  I would never blame you guys  For any  Oh my  Oh my god  Oh boy  And you can tell too  You're getting frustrated  Because you can tell  It's like  He's not even  Taking in what you're saying  He's just like  Whatever bro  He's just bummed that  He can't be sleeping right now  Because he's on the phone  I can't believe you woke me up  That's all he's thinking about  Is like  Oh god I want to go back to sleep  I can't believe I have to deal with this 
[02:00:30]  Yeah exactly  You know I don't even care  I've seen so many guys  Like just in stand up  That were lazy  And didn't want  Like they wanted their weekends free  Or they wanted to go out with their chick  And it's like  Okay dummies  Right  And then you fast forward  Fucking eight years  And they're making the same money  They made back then  Wasting time  Yeah  I'm saying it because  This kid has no idea  He's blowing it  I did a gig in Philly last night  We drove home two hours  I got a prostitute at 2.30 in the morning  Fucking suffered with central apnea 
[02:01:00]  And came in  And you're established  Wait how did  How did the prostitute get to your place  She took a cab  I swear to god  She took a cab  Why wouldn't you like  Assess the situation for yourself  Instead of just assuming so many things  One of them being  Ah I don't want to be stranded  In a fucking dreary hotel  In Manhattan  In Manhattan  I told Sal that he would not be stranded  I told him  The company will get you home  If you come in  Sal  And he told me 
[02:01:30]  It's too much shit to get around  Do you  Did you really say that Sal  What's too much shit to get around  You know  Coming into the hotel  Coming home  I can see the text  Travis just verbatim quoted him  No yeah  Absolutely  I just  I didn't want to be taking cabs  And shit like that  Getting out of the city  For  Why  It was just going to be  For one  Only one day  I mean  It seemed like  It's only going to be today  This is a fucking job  This isn't a hobby  Oh my god  Now you're so not 
[02:02:00]  Informed  Because  Everyone knows  It's going to be  A two three day event  So if the first day  Is sort of a bust  You at least get that one  Out of the way  If this shit happened tomorrow  I would understand  It is  It's a fucking job  We're not doing this  Because it's fucking  An after school project  You want to come over  And hang out  The other thing  When did this become  Like an office job  That like  Oh cool  I get a date  Like this is supposed to be  One of those jobs  Where it's like  Everybody  Does everything  In their power  To get in here  When there's a show  You're in there  For the show 
[02:02:30]  Nobody has that  Anymore  This is showpeness  I'm an asshole  And I'm frustrated  Because  I'm an asshole  I'm frustrated  Because he has no idea  What he's doing to himself  Unless the whole generation  Of entitled assholes  Are coming up together  So they'll figure it out  But do you realize  If you get rid of that  Entitled asshole shit  That he could go for  In this fucking world  I don't think  I'm entitled  Sal  I'm telling you  Compared to my generation  And the generations  In between  You're fucking entitled  Compared to my generation 
[02:03:00]  It's been happening  Slowly but surely  Over the last  You know  Couple decades  And no one thinks  They're entitled  I would be fired  If I was in your position  And didn't come to work  Back in the day  I would have been fired  They would be like  We don't need you  We don't need you  If you can't figure out  How to come in  When the shit hasn't hit yet  Sal can I explain to you  Something real quick  Oh Danny  Like I knew that  You could take the day  Like today was a pretty easy day  To stay home  Yeah  It was a pretty easy day  But I've been working  For this show for eight years 
[02:03:30]  This is precisely the thing  That you show up to work for  Right  Because you don't want to be  You  So  It's the same thing  When I knew that  I could stay home  And it was just like  Well I could take the day  Or I could go to Ants  And just take the ride  It was just like  You know what  I'll take the fucking ride  Why not  Because I don't want to be  The guy on the other end  Of this fucking phone  Yes  You don't want to be that guy  Raise your hand  If you've slept in the studio  Oh damn  But you guys  Did Ant raise his hand 
[02:04:00]  No  Yes I should have  I don't think that's what  He meant Jimmy  Now  You guys are about what  Eight to ten years old  And Sal  Yeah  And there's a difference  Huge difference  There's a difference between  Like Sal's age and your age  Yeah  I remember the transit strike  Yeah I was about to mention that  And we all slept in the studio  Because we knew  There would be another show  But Sal  That's not even  That's not even in his head  Like he's like 
[02:04:30]  What sleep in a studio  Where I work  That's crazy  Sounds like too much trouble  Doesn't it  Right  Too much shit to get around  Is all you need  To fucking read  That was it  In that text message  Too much shit to get  Travis was offering him  And telling him  Look  All right  We'll get you  Hear him back  And he truly believes that  So there's no way of  You know  Changing your mind  You know  Saying that you might  Be strained in a hotel room  For a couple days  I used to love that shit  Yeah  Like it was something different  Like wait  I could be in a hotel  Even when we were making  Good money at NEW 
[02:05:00]  And they would put us  In hotel rooms  Because a storm was coming  I was like  This is fucking cool  It's different  And we're picking  The hotels ourselves  And you know what that means  You pick the nicest one  And be like  I don't know what I'm doing  Sorry guys  Do you remember  When 9-11 happened  And people walked home  Holy shit  Do you fucking remember this  People walked across  Bridges into Queens  To go home  Yeah  Sal's like  You know  He's been here the least  And  But there's a weird thing  Going on  Because Troy has been here  The second least  With Sal 
[02:05:30]  Your wife made that point  To me in the office  She said  Notice who's here  The originals  Yeah  The originals  The originals  The Opie and Anthony staff  Oh man  That's right  Not the SiriusXM staff  Right  The Opie and Anthony staff  What am I going to be  Stuck in a hotel  For a couple days  No  It's just too much shit  Sal's doing right now  Is just looking at his phone  And being like  I can't  I shouldn't have woken up  He's giving the finger  To his phone  He's not even listening to us  He's like fuck you  It's like one of these idiots  Is going to be done  So I can go back to bed  Yeah  He's giggling 
[02:06:00]  You didn't tell Sal  Who was here taking attendance  Either Opie  You'd only told that to Troy  Oh boy  The big boss  Yeah Mel Karmazin's even here  Mel made it in  Mel Karmazin told the company  He's leaving  And he's here  There's a guy  That doesn't have to be here  He's officially not going to be  With the company  In a couple more months  He's taking stuff  Out of everybody's office  Right  It's all in a bag  So I think John Malone  Whoever's going to take over  Is not going to question  If Mel wasn't here today  Right  Mel already said  I'm done with this company 
[02:06:30]  Gary takes a bus in  To work every day  And all he does here  Is get shit on  By you guys  He could easily have said  Buses aren't running  But he's  Gary's here  Absolutely  How did he make it  There's no transit  I don't know  Did he fly here  Or something  He must have grown wings  Or gotten a jet pack  He must have used  One of his magic wizard spells  I got here  Sal  Do you honestly think  You couldn't get here  Was that honestly it  No the only solution  To getting in  Would be  Yesterday before 7  Which I was busy  Up until 
[02:07:00]  No no no  Forget about the mass transit  Forget about busy  When you're not here  There's other ways  We're all busy  When we're not here  Stop with the busy  When you're not at work  What were you doing  By the way  That we were so busy  That the next day at work  Didn't mean anything  Yeah well  How busy were you yesterday  I was in a recording session  From about  4pm  Until about 9  Well you know what you do  You go to the  You're not  You're not Led Zeppelin  You're gonna cut  Your fucking recording time  You cancel the recording session  Because you say  I have a job  So I have to cut my hobby short 
[02:07:30]  And get into the city  And get a free hotel room  In Times Square  Yeah  No Sam  You're missing the  I'm saying is  I was doing  That means I missed the  Bullets for taking  Polo transportation  You're missing the part  Where it inconveniences him  From what he wants to do  See he didn't even hear  What you had to say  To him  I'm gonna  I'm gonna record my shit  I'm not gonna cut it short  Yeah  You're missing it  Sam  You don't get it  Wow he so doesn't get it  No  I get it  I mean  Sal I've been around  A long time 
[02:08:00]  I know how  Hold on  I'm giving you a life lesson  I've been around  A long long time  I know how this shit  Ends  Ends up  Jimmy knows  With the comics coming up  And didn't want to  Put in that extra effort  I love fucking lazy comics  They're just that much easier  To step over  On the way up  Because I languish in mediocrity  You won't even listen  To what we're saying today  And it's too bad  Because you have no fucking idea  Oh boy  I'm listening  I'm taking it in  Next time there's  Next time there's like 
[02:08:30]  A chance to promote  Someone around here  Why the fuck  Did we promote you  Seriously  You're the lone man  On the totem pole  And you and Troy  Are the only ones  Not here today  Be like if I was like  Guys I got wrestling tickets  What am I going to miss wrestling  And take public transportation  A free Times Square hotel room  Then you and E-Rock  Either wouldn't have been here  And tripped on that one  Yeah you kind of did  I just got so excited  At the point  E-Rock's clapping  Happy I tripped 
[02:09:00]  Oh Sal  Yeah I don't know  What to say  Sal  People drive me nuts  Doesn't want to work  So Gary would have gotten  A car service  Drives me crazy  Why  I mean Troy too  A little bit  Troy and Sal  Both like  Just it was  If it was  Hurricaning right now  I'd still be a little  Like oh why wouldn't  They just  Yesterday afternoon  Because then I'm like  Because I'm thinking  To myself  What a fucking  Asshole I am  For making an effort 
[02:09:30]  To be here  When I could have  Just been like  Oh what  Brock's River Parkway's  Closed  Looks like I'm not  Getting in  Can't make it  Anybody have an  Alternative to give to me  Because I'm not  A self sufficient  Human being  Who can get here  On my own  It's like escape  From New York  No it's fucking  Walled city  Well yeah  Brock's River Parkway's  Flooded  What do you expect  I mean Sal  You live in the  Burrows of New York  Don't you  Yeah I live in  Williamsburg  No I wasn't talking  To you I was talking  To Sal  I mean Sam  Not Sal  Did I say Sal  No I live in another  County  I live in Westchester  That's not part of 
[02:10:00]  The main boroughs  Most people in New York  Consider it upstate  You're either hungry  Or you're not  That's it  There's no in between  Sal  E-Rock  Stop shaking  Not that kind of  Hungry E-Rock  I made it to work  I spit the microphone  I live out east  Yeah let me  Yes  Out east  I evacuated my  Apartment yesterday  Let me go to  Scott in Tampa  Scott  Scott talk to Sal  That's great Scott  This just infuriates me  I live in Tampa  I have a customer  In Virginia  That may be open  Tomorrow 
[02:10:30]  I'm driving to  Fucking North Carolina  So I can see  If they're going to  Be open  And this  You make child  Pornography  That doesn't count  You and Gary Glitter  What do you do  For a living  I do service work  For food and beverage  Cans  Oh okay  So  I have a customer  They may  They may or may not  Be open  But I have to be there  I have to try  Yeah it's not even  The question  You just know  In your heart  This is what I do  For a living  I gotta be there  You know 
[02:11:00]  How could you fault them  Really look at it  We come in  We joke around  It's not a real job  Right  You wanna take the day  Sal gets mad  At like  He doesn't like  To work hard  And I hate  To shit on you Sal  But the time  He got mad at Kenny  Was cause Kenny  Kept sending him out  For food  And he got mad at Kenny  And then he got  I fucked the whole thing up  He got mad at E-Rock  Cause E-Rock  Keeps having him do work  And then the first chance  The first chance  To possibly make some effort  To get here  That's beyond normal  Prove your ethic 
[02:11:30]  Absolutely choose  Not to take it  Yeah  You're  He's entitled  But he doesn't even know it  That's what's so strange  About the whole thing  When I  When I was officially  Doing radio shifts  In Rochester  I still had to deliver  Pizza for the midday  Guy  Every day  It was humiliating  But I  I couldn't tell anyone  Like you know what  I don't wanna deliver  The pizzas anymore  I just knew  I had to do that  Yesterday  Roland was right there  We were in the city  And Jess was saying  Sam  Can I please ask you  To just take the day off 
[02:12:00]  Cause I  I wanna just go home  And be in the apartment  Oh wow  And you know what I said  No  Whoa  And then you  Fucking backhanded her  Right  Backhanded her  And threw her  Into the street  She rolled across  Next time  Give me time to get  The video camera  Let me go to  Mike in Virginia  Mike  Hey boys  I just wanna point out  How spoiled  Sal is  I'm only 26  And I still  Have not  If I had the option  For my job  To live in a hotel  For free  For a couple of days  I would absolutely  Take it  His house must be 
[02:12:30]  Nicer than any hotel  Available  How sad is it  That he goes  What  Be stuck in a hotel  For a couple days  To work  Oh god  Oh wow  Dude I live in  An amazing apartment  I try to downplay it  But I really live  In an amazing apartment  I would take a hotel room  Cause that would be  Different and cool  Just throw your shit  All over the floor  And you get to do it  At Times Square  You get to go to  One of the nice  Touristy ones  You don't have to  Go to one of the  Shitty ones  I don't even have to  Rinse my washcloth out  Once I wash my ass  With it  I just throw it  In the side of the tub  Like thwock  Why am I rinsing it 
[02:13:00]  It's fucking  Let the maid get it  Who needs  The house  I just hear thwock  I'm like fuck  It's just coming  Into all your towels  That's what I would do  If I was there  Let me go to Steve  On Long Island  Steve what's up  He tried jumping on  Hey Steve  I just wanted to  Thanks Sal  For him and all the  Other people  They make my  Marjorie look like  A bunch of  Recards  I'm sitting to work  Right now  I had to pack a bag  They told me to pack a bag 
[02:13:30]  In case I have to sleep  Here tonight  I'm working like 75  Hours a week  I don't even really have  Much of a social life  Now you know what  I'm kidding  All right  Usually  But he's making  A really good point  I mean  Sal  How many hours a week  Do you have to work  It's like  I work like  Eight hours a day  For five days a week  You're working  Forty  It's not a hard forty  Like most people  It's an easy forty 
[02:14:00]  You don't have to go out  And get food  I'm not saying it's a hard forty  I never said I'm breaking my ass  Or doing anything like  Physically very demanding  There you know  And then the minute  It's like above and beyond  He's out  Oh yeah  He's out  Zero dedication  They go  He's out  Well I was busy  On Sunday  Not at work  You were busy  Sam I fucking  I work outside of  Of Syria  Yeah but what's your job  Last night you were  Were you  Do you work at the recording studio  I freelance everywhere  That I can  Oh  Freelance 
[02:14:30]  Were you working  Last night  At the recording studio  Yes I was getting paid  Not at the recording studio  I was getting paid  From the artist  To record them  Prince  Pick a career  Prince  Are we going to work  At a recording studio  Or are we going to be  A radio producer  No Sam  Fuck you  Don't tell me  What I can do  Oh  You pick a career  Because either you're here  Because obviously  This means you're prioritizing  Working in a recording studio  Over being here  So if you're  If you're making  That much money  Being a freelancer  Be a freelancer  Once I'm outside 
[02:15:00]  Of Syria  I'm free to do  Whatever the fuck  I want  Yeah unless it stops you  From getting here  The reason you're not here  Is because you decided  To work at a recording studio  Instead of taking  Public transportation  To get a free hotel room  The reason you're not here  Is because you're doing  Stuff outside of here  So you could pick  Right because I need to make  More additional income  That's the main thing  You're going to need to make  Even more than that  Exactly because apparently  Here it's just free money  Whether you're here or not  They give you money for free  So you got the free money  So now we'll make  Additional income 
[02:15:30]  Free  And this is like  He's been  Sam's not wrong  He's fresh out of  I need to make  Additional income  They're just not  They gave him  You're not wrong  You were  Intern a year ago  And then we give you a spot  And then like  It's not even raining yet  And you decide in your head  That it's acceptable  Not to try  He's making the salary  That I complain about  Having five years  After having the salary  And he's been making it  For six months  Well Sal  You could have worked  Last night  I don't begrudge  A guy working 
[02:16:00]  And then just come in  At fucking 10.30 or 11  Just called a couple hotels  Got in a fucking car service  Or taken a cab  There were absolutely cabs  There's a way to get into  Fucking Manhattan  From Brooklyn  I don't care what's happening  Yeah we're not talking about  In the middle of the woods  It's crazy  If you can have  If you can make money  Outside of here  And work here  Then more power to you  But if you're  Making money outside of here  And then using that  As the excuse  For I couldn't get  On public transportation  Then what are you doing  I want to thank Sal 
[02:16:30]  I finally figured out  Who I'm voting for  It's got to be Romney  Oh  Because you think  Obama's coddling  This is that Obama  Coddling shit  Maybe  The undecided voter  Has decided Romney  Because of Sal  Sal  Sal  Couldn't make it  My whole point is  You have no idea  That's what's sad  Because this all like  This all like  Ways into  How people  Treat you  And what they think  Of you  And what you can handle 
[02:17:00]  And enough of this  I gotta make money  Outside  You like making money  Outside of here  You live in an apartment  By yourself in Brooklyn  You could live  You could  Easily  Somebody doesn't even  Need money  You could pay less  For rent  And survive  You're not making money  To survive  You're living in an apartment  By yourself in Brooklyn  But Sam  But Sam  The reality is  These are the decisions  I've made  And that's what  I'm gonna work with  And that's what  I deal with  So it's  You can't give me shit  For being creative  Outside  No no no  But here's the  You didn't  Does daddy pay for his apartment  You'd have to ask him  Who pays for your apartment 
[02:17:30]  There's no way  You could afford that  I pay  I pay for my rent  Entirely  My parents helped me out  With like my cell phone bill  So what's rent  In Williamsburg  That he could afford that  I actually have  A very good deal  At my place  I have it worked out  My landlord  She was like  A family friend  So it's extraordinarily low  Comparatively speaking  For what  Family friend  How much is rent  That's not a big secret  Is it a good idea  To give that  I don't really think 
[02:18:00]  I don't know  Why would it be a secret  If someone pays in rent  Just don't give me your address  No one cares  We don't know where you live  I don't even know where you live  I can't even imagine  A scenario where it would matter  What  I can't even  Fucking come up with  What is your rent  Big brother's listening  I can't even come up with  It's just no matter what I do  I'm gonna get beaten up  Shut up  So I'll tell you  My rent is  My friend is  $1,300 a month  That's  That's  You know  That's pretty nice  About right  Right  But usually you're sharing  Usually you're sharing 
[02:18:30]  A shithole  $2,000 a month  Usually you're sharing  A shithole with someone  And your share is $1,300  To $1,500  But you said to Travis  Too much shit to get around  In the text  You didn't say  Look man I'm working  I'm gonna try to come in after  Will I be able to get  You didn't say any of that stuff  You just said  Too much shit to get around  Yeah  It just seemed like  It was too much of an issue  I know how the company is  With a lot of things  And I didn't wanna  I didn't wanna like  Well usually you would be right  But they opened their arms  And basically said  Look we'll do whatever 
[02:19:00]  We'll pay for your hotel room  We'll pay for the cab  We'll pay for the car service  Whatever  They obviously wanted  Everybody here  Right  If they were gonna go  To that extent  To get people to come here  Yeah  Usually you're right  But in this case  Nah they did the right thing  And they weren't even  Making people share rooms  Yeah  We used to have to share rooms  During the N.E.W. days  The I know how the company  Works thing  Is just what a guy says  When he's like  Oh this could be a free day  Yeah  And then I'll blame it  On the company  And I know  Opie and Anthony  Love bashing the company  Yeah there you go  Oh this one backfired 
[02:19:30]  That's not the case  The reality is  It's just that  I don't think  I've needed that  Incredibly much around  Oh okay  That's good  Wow we could save  A lot of money then  Yeah  We could save more  Than a hotel room  Is that what you tell  The bosses during  The reviews and stuff  I don't think  I'm really needed  Yeah I don't need to raise them  I don't need to do that  So could you tell me  What exactly is it  To do here  You know what  The phones are lit  Oh yeah  We've been talking about  The fucking storm of the century  No one gave a shit  And called us about anything  Yeah  But people are like  Really passionate about this 
[02:20:00]  One guy says he  Gets away with it  Because he can  He's not getting away  With anything in the end  If we're pushovers  If we're pushovers  Or the company's a pushover  That's one thing  But in the end  It will catch up to  A guy like Sal  If he doesn't wake up  You know what I see  When I see Sal  Money that's not in my paycheck  That's what I see  When I see Sal  Yeah fucking Sal  Would take your paycheck  In a second  Oh man  Has a problem with Sal  His work ethic  An NYPD guy  Saying I made it to work today  Does Sal know  How privileged he sounds 
[02:20:30]  I'm out of work  Oh boy  How many  Participation trophies  Does Sal have  I know I'm incredibly grateful  To have a job  In this current economy  And getting a job  Stop saying things  Working at a show  Like the ONA show  Stop saying things  You know  You know  Just saying things  That he's heard  I know  But this is  You know  This comes up  In my house a lot  Because I'm a father now  As people know  And the challenge  Is going to be 
[02:21:00]  Look I got kids  That probably won't  Have to work  So how do you  How do you raise them  So they don't turn out  Like this  Watch mommy dearest  Opie's son's first words  Were Sal's a bum  Oh  My kids have  Bigger bank accounts  Than most people already  So how the fuck  Do you raise them  In a way  Where they don't  Turn out like this asshole  Don't give them  Access to it  Yeah  But how do you do it  Just don't  Don't let them have it  Because Sal has no concept  Of the value of a dollar  I guarantee it  No  And when he wants to  I guarantee that  When he wants to  You know what 
[02:21:30]  God bless you  I wish I was brought up  That way  Fuck it  I would have been  A pill popping asshole  I'm not  I don't do drugs  You know what  And I should make that point  You don't  But I'm just  In general  That's what happens  A lot of these kids  You should do like  A lot of them  Like a lethal amount  You're mad right  Yes  Sam's mad for real  The way you addressed  Travis in the text  Was very telling  Because you weren't  Saying things  Like I'm going to try man  Is there any hotels  That you know of  You didn't ask 
[02:22:00]  Any of those questions  When Travis said  The company will get you  There and back  They offered  It wasn't like  Travis said  Can you get here  And you said  Hey man  I'm not sure how to do it  I don't have enough cash on me  It wasn't like that  There would have been a car  That would have come to you  Picked you up  And driven you here  Oh they would have made it  Nice for you  Probably would have been  A beverage in the car  So what's the excuse  Knowing that  You can't now say  Mass transit  You can't say  The storm was so bad  What is it  Knowing  But he didn't even  Get up at the usual time 
[02:22:30]  Just to see if  He could figure it out  Yeah  Like I would have  Not to pat myself  On the back  But I'm going to  I would have at his age  Like even if  All possibilities  Like they shut down  The cabs  This and that  I still would have  Got up at least  And sit  And just to see  If I could figure it out  Yeah  And he didn't even do that  Did he ask what car service  Other people were taking  No  Oh no  Oh so  Did you inquire in any way  How to get here  I told him  Uh no  I mean I knew about  The public transportation  I knew Travis made the offer 
[02:23:00]  And I decided  I politely declined the offer  You declined the offer  No thank you  He said  He decided not to come in  That was his decision  And my point is  That's going to  Fuck you over in the end  But you don't understand  That for whatever reason  It's all right  I understand  That's a poor decision  He doesn't  I can tell me  We have really  Checked out of this job  Like three months in  We have very easy jobs  Very easy lives 
[02:23:30]  Really did  But you do have  But you do have  To work hard  At his level  He did apologize  Or you're going to be  Lost behind  Left behind  He said  I'm sorry  I'm going to stay here  So he apologized  I'm sorry  I'm going to stay  I'm going to stay here  Why would you do that  I'm sorry  I'm going to stay here  Yeah exactly  And then he goes  Yeah I'm sorry  I'm going to stay here  It's too much shit  To get around  The only reason  That I like Sal  And his whole generation  Is because  I know  That as somebody  Who's trying to come up  Yeah 
[02:24:00]  There is no threat  From who's under me  Right  There's no competition  As long as I work  With people  Like you know  You're top of the food chain  The threat is  Everybody around me  And above me  At least nobody under me  No one's coming  From behind  To get you  Don't worry about it  I used to  Talk to the interns  And try to give them advice  You know  I stopped that probably  Right after you guys  Were hired  Yeah  I noticed a drastic change  With these kids  Coming up  It's crazy  It's crazy  I noticed a drastic change  Like they have no concept 
[02:24:30]  Of working a hard day  Like isn't there  Like just an amount  Of like pride  That you know  You would be able to have  To be able to say  I got here  And you didn't  To the people  Who didn't get here  Do you think he gave up  After that fucking  Roland Panda bit  Got killed so hard  Like almost  He crushed his fucking spirit  Like have you ever had  Your creative input  So completely  Made fun of  And mocked  Sal 
[02:25:00]  Sal coming  Did you fall  Oh uh  Did you fall back  To sleep  I definitely  I definitely  Lost some steam  After that  Definitely  Oh  That was the first time  Again that's that  Entitled shit  No one ever told  Something stinks  Yeah  Well it's the  Participation trophy  Yep  That's exactly it  And you can't just be like  Fuck I gotta try  I gotta do something better  Do you understand  The value of working hard  Hardly working  Yeah  A hard day  Oh look at this  Fucking battery  A hard day of work 
[02:25:30]  Do you understand  That value  In terms of  I don't get me wrong  I don't think  I've ever worked  Like a very  Physically demanding job  You know  The working  At the ONA show  Has a whole different  A whole different feel  To it than  Any other conventional  Sure you can come in  Or not come in  It doesn't matter  I feel like today  The feel of that  Soft pillow under your head  How would you know  You've never actually  Worked a day  At the Opie and Anthony show  You don't think  He's worked hard yet  No  Oh  No  He's done 
[02:26:00]  The adequate amount  That's asked of him  And then he goes home  Thinking hey man  They asked me to do something  I did it to an appropriate level  I don't understand  Why I'm not getting more praise  Could you imagine  If Sal had a fucking  Facebook page  What the audience  Would do to it  It's crazy  Destroy it  I'll be like that one  Does he  I don't know  I didn't even know  Sal do you have  A Facebook page  Yeah but it's  It's a personal  And it's not like  Oh  People just can't  Oh people can't  It's not a fan  It's not a fan page  No  Well 
[02:26:30]  Someone is reminding us  RFGVAC  Billy Staples  Back in the day  On 9-11  Snuck onto a train  And hid in the bathroom  To make it into  The Ron and Fez show  That's a true story  If the train's running  But what  Just for  For employees  Yeah  And he had to sneak  Into the bathroom  Because they were  Making people leave  Station by station  Like once I heard  That story  I was like  I have to be here  When the  Because I can't be out  Because otherwise  You're outshined  By a Ron and Fez producer  You don't want to be that 
[02:27:00]  No  No  I've never heard that story  Yeah he was in a bathroom  Too bad he didn't try  To sneak in on one of the flights  I understand when  I don't know  There's just not  There wasn't much happening today  Today was the day  To easily make it in  Today's the easy day  To look good  Tomorrow  They're definitely  You know  The staff will be different  Yeah  Tomorrow it'll be  A little different  They'll still be incompetent  But they'll be a little bit different  Right  But today was the day  That I  You know  It was obvious  Everyone was going to make it in 
[02:27:30]  I didn't want to come in today  I was tired  Dude  I was like  Jimmy had a big run  In Philly  At Helium Comedy Club  Jimmy is an established  Sal  Jimmy is an established comic  And still working his fucking ass off  Absolutely  He could have easily said  You know what  With the storm  And knowing that the company  Allows Jimmy to take days  When he's doing his comedy stuff  Jimmy could have easily said  Fuck you guys  I'm not coming in today  Easily  You don't get it though  I don't want to question it  You don't understand 
[02:28:00]  Sal worked slightly harder  Than a couple of the retarded interns  And then he got the job  So he got the job  Now it's over  He got the job  Yeah  Jimmy's established  And he's not slacking  And he saw all these guys  Coming up that slacked  And he fucking marched  Right past them  That's amazing to me  How many guys  In this business  In stand up  Are fucking just lazy  They're fucking lazy  They want shit handed to them  When I started radio  I completely sucked  But I had the passion to do it 
[02:28:30]  I wanted to do this  And I knew  There were guys  Way ahead of me  At my age  Way the fuck ahead of me  But I fucking worked hard at it  Because it was something  I wanted  Sal  Comment  Yes  And I see those guys now  Just  Some of them  Are just in horrible  Shitty  Who gives a fuck  Markets  Still trying to make it  Now you make fun of them  In October  Wow  And you try to bond  With them on Twitter  They ignore them  But you know what  There's hope there  By the way  If you don't care  If I'm to believe  Someone that DM'd me 
[02:29:00]  There's hope  For me and my old pal  Jim Chandler  Hey why didn't you  Fucking call Larry  And get a snowcat  You made it in  The difference is though  If you don't care  Larry Durker  Larry Durker  Would have gotten you  A snowcat  You fucking  Unreliable assholes  Then you could have  Just gripped it  And put your dumb face  Right by the window  Macadamia nut toes  If you don't care  Like if you don't  Actually want this 
[02:29:30]  This is an easy job  If you don't give a fuck  Yeah but the problem is  Eventually  You have to quit  Because then you realize  What the fuck  Nothing's happening  I'm not moving up  I don't understand  I don't understand  Why they didn't pick me  For that or this  You remember Paul  That didn't get picked  For Sal's job  Yeah  Well he texted in  I'd call in  But I'm at work  I showed up  The day after  My best friend died  Oh man  Fuck Sal  He is lazy  Shit  Wow 
[02:30:00]  What do you think  Tell Paul to get  His resume back in  Yeah  What about Butch  We didn't pick Butch  To continue with us  Butch  And he's a rock star  Now on another channel  Is he really  Yeah he's great  Liquid metal  Good for  What's Butcher doing  Liquid metal and faction  He's doing programming  And he's got on air  And everything  He's doing awesome  We couldn't pick everyone  We can't bring everyone  Along with us  Like the Paul situation  Is a bad one too  Because that was a tough  Fucking call  And I feel bad about it  Yeah we like Paul  We like Paul  And Butch  At the time 
[02:30:30]  We were hiring people  But we didn't have  Enough spots  He could have said  Alright there goes my dream  He continued to work  Really hard  And now he's a rock star  With liquid metal  You think he was  Taking days off  He's doing really well  I didn't know that  You think he was  Taking days off  Like if it was  Sprinkling with a little breeze  You think he was like  I can't make it in  Butcher  Yeah  Butcher comes in on  Saturdays sometimes  Exactly  Well he doesn't know  He wouldn't have known  If it was sprinkling or not  He was sleeping  Oh that's true  So he didn't know  What to work  It could have been horrible  I'm sorry Sal  It could have been really bad  I'm sorry Sal  Because I thought  You might have known  By the way  My point is really simple 
[02:31:00]  Sal should at least  Got up and try to see  If there was a way  That's all  Comment  I got a text from somebody  Who's also on his way to work  It would be Pat Duffy  Saying I would have made it in  I've made it in during worse  Sal is a bitch  Oh  Wow  Not only would Sal  Would fucking Pat Duffy  Have made it in  He would have brushed his teeth  With duty  Yes  When he got here  Pat Duffy was a fucking trooper  It's the best  Seven years in  Like I've been working  For seven years  Jesus  I'm still coming in  On motherfucking Sundays 
[02:31:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Sundays  I'm in this  Piece of shit studio  What happened?  There's cabs going by  Oh yeah  Jesus Christ  I swear to you  I think it was even more  Alright fine  But I thought I saw even more  Roland's pointing at the TV  Going look at all the cabs  They're doing a weather report  In lower Manhattan  Where the shit is really  Hitting the fan a little bit  And there's cabs everywhere  It looks like they're outside  Of a fucking cab factory 
[02:32:00]  It looks like they were  Fucking hilarious  It looks like they were  In front of a hotel waiting  I love how he just did it though  He goes look  Look at the cabs  Look at the cabs  And he's pointing at the TV  And there's a cab parade  Marching down the street  Holy shit  Classic  Oh my god  But it's not Sal's fault  He didn't realize there were cabs  He just woke up  Yeah  That's true  It's not his fault  Comment  Sal you just wanted the day off  And you thought a storm  Would be a good experience  And everyone wants a day off  But not in your  You don't have that luxury 
[02:32:30]  No you gotta weigh it out  With how bad am I gonna look  Well you do have the luxury  Obviously  But if you're trying to make  Something of yourself  You don't have the luxury  You put that in your head  Like I don't have that luxury yet  You know when your day off  Is always a balancing act  Between how cool is it  To have a day off  And how fucked am I gonna be  For taking the day  That's pretty much it  But it's more than that too  If you're coming up in a business  Well that's what I mean  How fucked are you gonna be  How fucked are you gonna be  I was arguing with  You know Jess wanted to do  A 14 day honeymoon  Oh my god  And I wouldn't allow it  Well you're an idiot 
[02:33:00]  Well she wanted you  To come back after 7  So how  How old are you  How old  I'm 22  Alright I'm 22  Now do you realize  When I was 27  I was still working  Christmases at radio stations  At 27  Oh  Sal  My mom  I mean as much as I beat  The shit out of her  She would  She would  She would stall Christmas  Until I got home  My whole family  Had to celebrate  A couple years in a row  Christmas  A day or two afterwards 
[02:33:30]  Which was the weirdest thing  But she did that for me  Knowing that I had to  Work Christmas  Because it was something  I believed in  When I was coming up  In this business  I was the low guy  I had to work Christmas  I had to work Thanksgiving  I had to work New Year  I worked every fucking holiday  You didn't have another  Great gig though  A recording studio  True  That's right  That's true  And there weren't cabs  Available to you  22 especially  I can't even imagine  That I would just fucking  Take it lightly  So many cabs  On that show  Dude I've actually  Never seen more cabs  In a row  I've never seen  It was so fucking funny 
[02:34:00]  Dude  The woman's talking  And behind her  Are the streets of New York City  And all we saw  Were cabs  I was wondering  Why are they doing  A cab documentary  At this time  Dude this morning  I was letting  What the Christ  I was letting cabs pass  Because Roland  Hadn't met us  On the corner yet  Right  Four cabs passed  Ah we'll get the next one  We'll get the next one  There's plenty  And then Roland got there  So it took seven seconds  To get in one  Especially in New York City  There's opportunists  All the time  So if they're  If they're saying 
[02:34:30]  That cabs aren't  Going to be running  Trust me  There's a bunch of assholes  Going oh really  That's more money for me  I'm getting in my  Fucking cab this morning  Unless it's mandatory  That they completely  Shut that down  Which they wouldn't do  Or there's the other  Assholes going  Really cabs aren't running  I'm jumping in my  Fucking car  And I'll drive people around  And nobody  Everybody knows  That me and E-Rock  Drive in  Like nobody knew  That I was definitely  Going to be in a hotel room  And E-Rock wasn't  Nobody texted me  Or E-Rock  Being like look  I'm fucked right now  Is there any way  You could drive me  I'm here on Sundays 
[02:35:00]  Sal knows that  Could you pick me up  In  Oh Sal  Or at least ask  The car  If Travis says  They're getting cars  For people  And you can get one  And you don't say  Well can I have a number  Who they're using  Because you would assume  They're all using  The same one  Even if they're not  Zero left  There's one  Waiting at a red light  Someone just got out  Columbus Circle  That's the Time Warner  Building at Columbus Circle  There's nothing but cabs  Yeah cab there  Cab across the street  One, two, three  Oh that's so funny 
[02:35:30]  Someone just got out  Of the cab on TV  I just went outside  Real quick  Just looked out the window  Jim can you tell me  How many cabs  You count in that picture  Oh no  Wait a minute  Now from this height  One, two, three, four  Five different cabs  Going in two different directions  Look at them all  It's not only cabs on TV  It's only cabs  They're the only cars  That men have right now  They're the only cars  On the street  Yes  Holy shit Sal  Sal did you set your alarm 
[02:36:00]  This morning to get up  Yeah it went off  But I went right back to sleep  Cool man  What time did the alarm go off  What time does it go off  Yeah  Look you're at a crossroads  I hope you listen to  Some of the shit we're saying  Stand in the middle of it  Whatever  I hope you listen to us today  Because you're so wrong  And maybe you don't know it  But  Sal, comment  No one's firing you 
[02:36:30]  But when it comes to  Moving up in this business  You'll see how slowly  It's going to move for you  It's free money here  At SiriusXM  They give it to whoever wants it  Free money  And then you make  Your other money  Sam works his balls off  It still doesn't make  Proper money  But that's not fucking  Deterring him from  Taking a day off  Or not showing up  When you started  Complaining about  Kenny giving you  Too many trips  And nobody else was going  A fucking  Red flag  Red flag  Immediately  Let me say hi to Pat Duffy  Pat Duffy  Oh no  Hey good morning guys 
[02:37:00]  Hey Pat  Pat Duffy  How are you sir  Doing alright  I just wanted to call in  And formally apply  For Sal's job  Alright  Because I'm sure  That I could do  Everything he does  Plus actually show up  For work and add  Entertainment value  Wow  You don't think  Sal's hitting it  Out of the park Pat  No not quite  Maybe a bug bloop  Single  Pat does it drive you  Crazy  Not necessarily this break  But just the day to day  Of like  Sal's existence  On the show  Obviously you listen  It drives me insane 
[02:37:30]  It sends chills up my spine  Knowing that this kid  Doesn't give a shit  About where he's at  Or what he's doing  He doesn't  He actually said  I want a highlight reel  Of all the things  Sal said  If we could do that  For tomorrow  He actually thought  It was going to be a hassle  To be in a hotel  In Manhattan  For a couple days  Pat  Don't you dream  Of being able to  Hang out in a hotel  In Manhattan  For a few days  On the company till  Absolutely  It would be like  Risky business  All over again  Yeah see  That's all I would do  And by the way  Sam earlier said 
[02:38:00]  Raise your hand  If you slept in the studio  I've also slept in the studio before  Yes  So you just have to do  Whatever it takes  Exactly  Sirius would be stuck  Paying the bills  With Sal's blood stained wall  I mean  Pat Duffy's blood stained walls  On his hotel room  There's something fun about  When you've got to stay  In a hotel or whatever  I kind of like that  You feel like you're  Going away to camp  It's an adventure  It's stupid  But it's fun  It's a little adventure  Hey you get naked  And jerk off  Absolutely  In the lobby  Now you know why  We couldn't hire Pat Duffy 
[02:38:30]  Exactly  Just fuck with your friend  But it's not  Like you also  Guess what  When you're stuck  In a hotel from the company  They're also paying  For your meals  Right  So you're going out  To dinner  It's a hassle  For someone  Eating wherever  Too much shit  To get around  Too much shit  To get around  Is it  When am I going to get  My macrobiotics  What does that even mean  Too much shit  To get around  Jimmy knows  Jimmy knows  What this kid's doing  What does it mean  I know Jimmy knows  Exactly  He knows  There's so many guys  Like you  You know  There's guys with passion  They laugh at guys 
[02:39:00]  Like you Sal  They'll step on your  Fucking head  To move forward  You ever have food  On your hand  And you hold it out  To a dog  And there's  Like some dogs  Will run right over  Before you even  Put the food down  And start fucking yelping  And then there are some  That you put your hand  Out with the food  And the dog  Just stares at you  Until you walk over  And put it  There's a different  Stick the peanut butter  In his face  But that's the difference  Some dogs are like  That little  That little fucking  Cunty poodle  Yes  Want you to walk over  And put it right under  His nose  You're calling him  A cunty poodle  Yes  It's a great tattoo 
[02:39:30]  Yes  New name  Oh Sal  Cunty poodle  Sal  Did you think  Cunty poodle  Will never stick  Did you think  You dropped the ball  This much  When you decided  To take the day off  Did you think  Did you foresee this  He still doesn't think  He's dropped the ball  Do you understand that  Wait  Don't get the cunty poodle  Angry  Don't  Get  The cunty  Poodle  Angry  Angry  Meow 
[02:40:00]  Meow  You have to be like  A gerbil  Making a noise  Or something  Nothing close  To a dog  Yeah  Hey Pat  Anything else  Meow  No that's it boys  You guys have a good day  I'm driving my girlfriend  To work  Your girlfriend's  Making it to work  And we're gonna make  That viral video  Pat's giving me ideas  For viral videos  And so far  You can only imagine  That they're  Completely outrageous  Yeah  I would assume so  That's where  Pat's mind usually  He wants to staple  I'll tell you  One of his ideas 
[02:40:30]  And I love it  But I think  He'd either die  Or we'd get arrested  He wants to staple  A shit load of money  To his body  And let people  Just yank it off  I can't imagine  How that would be good  For him in the end  I think that's assault  And inciting a riot  He's an animal  I love the idea  Pat  Trust me  I'm just trying to  Figure out how  We'd do it  I remember  Everyone's sort of safe  A bunch of Jews  That come up to you  Right  My mother would always  Say that  Chip  That's ugly  We'll keep brainstorming  Alright Pat  By the way  Chip's in today  Which should say  Something  Exactly  Chip  And Uncle Paul  Made it 
[02:41:00]  Paul didn't even  Wipe the blood  Off his dick  We should break  Sal  Sure  We should take a  We should break  Sal  Have you learned  Anything today  Sal  Yeah  Don't answer  The phone  I knew he was  Going to say it  I knew  I was  I knew he was  Going to say it  This  This means  Nothing to him  No  He'll go about  His day  I think he's been  Making like  The talkie  He sends me out 
[02:41:30]  Too much  You're actually  Trying to get me  To do stuff  Yeah  You don't give a fuck  Are those hipsters  Still in your canoes  What's the fallback  His opening joke  Yeah  Nailed it  When all these  When all these  Sort of dreams  You have  Like completely fail  What's the  What's the backup plan  Trades  Dad's family business  What is it  Cab  Cab  Hold on  We're looking at  Fucking  I'm going to count  One  Two  Three in the background 
[02:42:00]  Four  That's one right there  That light  Five  Oh there's another one  Oh yeah  Because they don't go to Brooklyn  Six  That's another one  Coming around the corner  I have never seen  Dude there's so many cabs  They're frustrated  They can't find people  To pick up  They all have their lights on  They all have their lights on  They're like fuck  That sense though  Like you were asking  What the fallback is  That sense that  Some people have  Of I have to make this work  This is all I'm doing 
[02:42:30]  This is what I have  I'm going to make sure  It doesn't even occur to Sal  He's just like  Sam what do you got to back  You don't have any backup plan do you  This is it  Obviously  Do you think  There is any  Part of me  That would still be here  If there was anything else going on  This isn't a pleasurable experience  Day by day  I don't have a backup plan  Sam's working on a book  My life as a white man  He's like that black guy in disguise  He's going to write a book  About his experiences  He's not watching wrestling videos  On WWE.com  He's looking at the 
[02:43:00]  Human resources department  Exactly  Sal will always be financially set  He's good to go  And I think  In some ways  It shows  That's a problem  If you're really  Trying to be the best at something  There's no reason to work hard  Since there's all these cabs out outside  I thought it might be fun  Because the streets are so empty  Maybe me and Roland or something  Can go downstairs  And have a cab race  To Sal's apartment  Yeah well we could get a cab  To Sal's apartment  You've got to get a cab  Make it down to like  Penn Station and back  And see who's 
[02:43:30]  And see who could do it quicker  Or Danny  At least go down there  And interview the cabbies  And go  How hard is it getting affairs today  We'll just go and interview the cabbies  And say question one  Why wouldn't you pick up Troy and Sal  I don't understand  We kept beeping  That Troy would not get into cab  My cabbie impression  Yeah it was good  Very good  He kept giving me the  The hand across the neck motion  No  It's the man with shellac hair  Would not get in  Sal  Anything else Sal  No

[02:45:00]  Because this was after Steve died  So we were just reminiscing about Steve  We actually had a nice laugh  At dinner  Talking about that  Dummy  My car couldn't get out of the parking lot  Yes  I remember that  Yeah  The snow storm  The big storm  Yes  But he was always  At least he answered his phone  When you called him  That's true  You could call him at 6  He would answer  Yeah  Yeah  And he just knew he was fucked  Yeah  This has been one big hassle for Sal  Oh yeah  The last hour has just been a hassle  What a problem  What a problem this is for Sal  He's gotta hit the snooze button 
[02:45:30]  On his phone one more time  Man  Yeah today was the day  Because tomorrow  Obviously it's gonna be a lot different  It might be  I still don't believe this left turn  I'm with Anthony  Yeah I'm not  This fucking thing is headed straight up to Maine  Yes  The water is absolutely rising  In a lot of places now  Dude it's gonna rain  We're gonna get some wind  A little bit of flooding  But uh  I think this is gonna be a motherfucker  Well I can't see how fucking deep the water is  Because they're showing the fucking  The stock market ticker on  What are they doing?  Yes  They're trying to show how deep the water is 
[02:46:00]  You know  That's Battery Park  That water is up over the side  Yeah it's starting to come up  That looks creepy  You know how um  Jocktober ends this week right?  Yeah  And we usually look at ourselves  Yeah  And know what we should do  What?  And we usually like to go way back  Yeah  But to finish up this Jocktober  We should do our Hurricane Katrina fucking show  Oh we were bad on that one  We were so bad  If you get a few clips of us going on  It's gonna be nothing  I got a short bit from the old days 
[02:46:30]  So we do a little bit from the old days  A little bit from Katrina  Yeah  Yeah that'll work  You found that old bit?

[02:47:00]  Fun games  There was a production piece  I wanted to make  To play in the last day or two of Jocktober  I thought it would be fun  We don't have a production guy though  So  Oh right  That probably is not gonna happen  That would have been  I'll tell you  The old bed of yours at Sam has  Very good  Strong?

Chip Chipperson  That stuff's the best  The old stuff  We did the Child of the 80s thing already  Right  It's not Child of the 80s  It's not as long  And horrible  I mean Child of the 80s  Is a rough one for you guys  To get through  I know what you found  What?  He probably does  I know what you found  I bet you do know  Cause I listened  Curse Man  Oh yeah  It's a bit we don't even remember  What is Curse Man?

It'll take a little while to get through  Yeah I'm sure  Are there any lines in there  That they may not be proud of today?  I mean I don't know  Yeah I'm not sure they'll be proud of  Every single line in there  Ah ah yeah

Because I just remember when I was 22  I didn't have my own place in Williamsburg, Brooklyn  With an easy gig where I knew I could just not go into  But if you have  22  22 I was in Rochester doing part time radio  I was making less than $10,000 a year  And had to do everyone's shit work  And I had to share a house with five or six guys  That used to fucking freebase 
[02:50:00]  Downstairs all night  While I was trying to get some sleep  So I could come in and do Brother Weezer's show  Did they try to get you to do it with them?  Fuck yeah  And you had to avoid the freebase?  I finally moved to Buffalo  Because I knew I had to move on from the craziness  Wow  But that was me at 22  But it's not even  This kid's in his own place in Williamsburg  The problem isn't he  Like if he were privileged  I was literally  I was literally living in a crack house  Because I couldn't afford to live anywhere else  Yeah  And I lived in an attic with my other  My other buddy for a while  Yeah  In an attic  That was the only fucking space that was available 
[02:50:30]  For the money that I had  If he were privileged  And had work ethic  And was hungry and everything  That would be fine  Like if he had his own nice apartment  But then also came in here  And worked his ass off  That'd be one thing  I didn't even have a car for a while in Rochester  So I rode my bike  It's shitty  And you know how fucking shitty  The weather gets up  I was the guy on a bike in the winter  Well that's the problem  To get to work  You couldn't take days off  Because you were trying to avoid your place  You didn't want to go home  Yeah why would you want to go home  Williamsburg 
[02:51:00]  It was a big time party house  And I remember the guys would really start getting into the party  And I would be waking up  And they would still be partying  And there might have been some freebasing  Is it the compound?  I never freebased  The Opster never freebased  No?  He did a few bumps here and there  Because he thought he'd be cool with the chicks  How did the Opster do?  But no freebasing for the Opster  Was the Opster on Coke still good with the chicks?  I put up numbers  You did?  Oh yeah  Good for you  I put up some numbers  Cokester  And this guy's got his own place in Williamsburg  This shit drives me nuts 
[02:51:30]  Because I know how I was at 22  No one was going to help me out  Freelancing in recording studios with rock stars  I'm busy on Sunday bro  I can't come in  And anyone help you out at 22?  Did you have your own place in Williamsburg at 22?  No  Not quite  You were pretty much living in a car  I did have a room for rent  And upstairs of a house  With some guy that lived across the hall  We had to share the bathroom  And occasionally when I was starving  I broke into his apartment to steal Hydrox cookies  Cool  So basically you lived in the hotel from Big 
[02:52:00]  Yeah  That's pretty much where it was  One room  Oh I didn't  I had to spread the cookies out  Like I'd eat  I'd eat like three of his cookies  But then I'd spread them out a little  Hope he would notice  So it would still be as long in the sleeve as it was  And it wasn't even good cookies  It was ghetto ass Hydrox  No it was terrible Hydrox cookies  Make funny kids who brought Hydrox for lunch  Of course you would  I remember  I as a 22 year old in that same house  Was stealing everyone's change  If I found change  I was stealing it 
[02:52:30]  And then I was getting the Chef Boyardee  Fucking raviolis  48 cents for the herbster  Do you know how much change of yours I stole when I was an intern?  There you go  So you know the game  Did you guys realize that you didn't get silver change back for two and a half years?  That's true  Travis said that  But you do what you can  Is my point  There were days where I got to work  And I'm like I hope everyone's hungry today  Because I have to get home  Right  Travis said to me  He was like you don't have to give them back all the coins  Because then if they need change later  You have it  Just carry it with you  At the end of every day 
[02:53:00]  That was the end of your change  Right in the jar  Right in my house  I don't blame you  You're playing the game I did at your age  Yeah  You did what you had to  I'd like my change  I figured the talent wasn't going to miss their 34 cents  I probably bought action figures with it  At 22  Because I was absolutely living in an attic  That wasn't  Didn't have installation  And I was looking at the stars at night from my bed 
[02:53:30]  In these little holes in the roof  And the snow would actually come through the fucking roof  No way  And we had piles and piles of blankets  That girls were giving us  So we could try to stay warm up there  And then we had a kerosene heater with no ventilation  To try to stay warm  That was the only place I could find  For the amount of money I was making  Your breakfast change probably paid for one of my horrible  All over print kid robot hoodies  That you just turned me for  But  And this kid 22  I'm certainly obsessing 
[02:54:00]  Living by himself in Williamsburg  You should obsess over it  It's infuriating  And then I moved on from there  Like ooh  I could actually get an apartment with a window  This is cool  But the guys will be freebasing  But hey  It's a step up  And he's just sitting there  Looking at his phone  Like he saw the first time that we called  He didn't take the call  He saw the second  He's like alright  I'm not going to take this call  The third time  He was finally like  What the fuck do these guys want?  Jimmy, where were you at 22?  I lived with my parents  And I was out doing stand up every night  Aw  But I lived with my parents 
[02:54:30]  What's that got in you?  Yeah right  But you didn't want to be living  You didn't want to be living  With your parents  A lot  Jimmy lived with his parents  Until he was almost 30  Until I was 30  And Florentine showed me mercy  See  This is what we're getting at  Jimmy lived with his parents  Until he was 30  But he had a dream  And he knew  Look if I live with my parents  That could you know  Allow me to try to go for this thing  And I brought prostitutes  Into the house  Ooh  Yeah  My grandmother's  Rest her soul basement  Sometimes right in the 
[02:55:00]  Right in the driveway  In the driveway  And sometimes they were pregnant  We've heard the stories over the years  While my friend Larry and I  Both supposedly sober  Had a pregnant  Eight month pregnant girl  Spark up a crack pipe  And then blow us  Jesus  Holy shit  Nothing to do with the conversation  Of course not  Figured I'd throw it in  Yeah  Interesting stories  Is all  So we've been there  But Sal will never  Never  Well actually you know what  He will never learn the lesson  He will not  I was working during the day  Still when I was 22  I was working

[03:09:30]  That is  Bullcrap Dave  This game  Is not only sucks  It's so confusing  Why?  Because their sounds  Instead of having a buzzer  They say things  So she's going  Mmm  And he's going  Bon Appetit  And the clip is still playing  Oh that's how they buzz in  Yes  Oh  It's terrible  Your buzzer can't be four syllables long  No  Oh  It's awful  Oh that's kind of clever  We should  You like that  Yeah we should do that

[03:11:00]  The literal translation  A heavenly monk  A heavenly monk  Fuck  Which makes sense  Who cares?  Who cares?  Wow  This is awful radio  I'd say useless trivia  That you will never remember  That's terrible radio  That's a great name for your cock  If it's big  Hey why don't you get over here  And suck the tenzo  Why don't you take my tenzo  My old tenzo  Why don't you take my tenzo  And the fucking duty comes out  And final statement

Or is that bullcrap?  Michelle Proctor  Of the Canadian Cancer Society  You get in first there  I'm going to go with fact 
[03:12:00]  And I know that  Because when I first heard it  I was feeling a lump  Under my armpit  What a drag to have on the radio  She must be  A fucking cancer lady  I hope you didn't give it away  She didn't give it away  I did  I just said I know the answer  I didn't say anything  Bullcrap  I like that Jim thinks  The cancer lady  Just gets cancer all the time  Every answer is related to cancer  Tenzo  Yes  Because my friend was dying  And that's who he hired 
[03:12:30]  To cook for him  He had a tenzo  Make him special organic food  Did it help?  Not at all  Did you get the end  Of that one though?  No  What happened?  I think it was bullcrap  Yeah  It was bullcrap  I swear to you  I don't even know  What the question was  We'll see  The lady said  I know it  And then the cancer lady  Oh Gordon Ramsey  Yeah  What the bummer said  Wait I'm going to try  To figure this out  Okay the question  Was about Gordon Ramsey  Correct  Wow  Couldn't even begin to  Gordon Ramsey 
[03:13:00]  And she guessed  Wait do you know  The question?  Yeah  It's a clip we just played  Right?  Yeah  And I'm not  Doing a bit  I have no idea  What was the question?  And they asked if  Gordon Ramsey had played  In this under 14  Oh right  Football  That's exactly right  Yes  Ding  And yes  And she was like  Oh I know this  And she said  Yes that is true  And then for knowing it  And being so confident  She looked kind of silly  When it turned out  To be bullcrap 
[03:13:30]  Thus then why the show  Is a wonderful show  To listen to  That's exactly right  Ontario and Canada  They trick you  They take those left turns  Like this fucking hurricane  That's right  The hurricane's going  Fucking one way  It goes the other  That's the last of any  Alertness I'll have today  That's it  The rest of my day  Will be spent  Not knowing or remembering  Anything  Okay  Thank you  Here's the marquee bit  To wrap up this  Jacktober show  And I wanted to make sure  That I put on  This is the bit of all bits  Because like you said  They kind of

[03:14:30]  Before we play the bit  Beat  The Breakfast Bacon Time  Beat Breakfast  The show is called  Or the station is called  The Beat  Right  So it's Beat Breakfast Bacon Time  Is what it's called  The bit  Do they have to say that  Really fast or something  Beat Breakfast Bacon Time  You have to do something  Faster than it takes  To make bacon  Okay that's your guess  Anthony  Beat Breakfast Bacon  Oh I know  Yes  Breakfast Bacon Time  Is a girl  And they're encouraging  The best of violence  I bet you 
[03:15:00]  Someone eats bacon  And they have to  Answer the question  Before the guy  Eats all the bacon  Anything Mr. Anthony  Or you're just  You're just  I'm boggled at this one  Just the mystery of it  Breakfast Bacon Time  Beat  So you gotta beat  Breakfast  You gotta beat Bacon Time  So obviously there's a couple  Fucking things  Bacon  Someone's gonna be a pig  And eat the bacon  But you have to answer  The question before  The bacon's eaten  Unless  There is no thought  Put into this bit  And the word beat  Is just from the radio station  That's what I thought  It was beat  And I'm throwing away beat 
[03:15:30]  And I'm just thinking  It's Breakfast Bacon Time  Do they just make bacon?  I want you to  Put even less thought into it  Oh my god  Oh my god really?

I had the answer 
[03:16:30]  Why would you just accept my answer  As being the answer?  You didn't say final answer  I said they would probably have to say this  Really fast or something  I'm playing by opster rules  You didn't say that?

Dumb  Shit  Oh  Oh look  Massapequa's all fucking flooded  Street  Yeah man  That happens down there  Still  All the shit that happens when we get storms is happening  I want to see the unusual  There's a lot of big storm coming  I want to see the unusual  Which I guess we'll see later today  Yeah  Well 
[03:21:00]  Yeah  All right  I'm looking  Ooh that guy's Mercedes might be in  Flooded street  Is that Sal's Mercedes?  I might want Sal to  Snot  Get  Sal you gotta get someone to move your Mercedes  Move your Mercedes  It's getting flooded  Call your driver  Although I'm sure you'll just get another one if it just fucking  Yeah  Floats away  Yeah  But the wheels are wet  Is Massape people way out there?  No  It's one of the south shores  There are fucking towns on Long Island  And you know  They get flooding like this 
[03:21:30]  When these storms come through  Yeah  That's where  One of my present house guests live  Yes  One group of house guests live down there  And it does get a little soggy down there  Oh boy  It's all fun and games in the summer  When you got that  When you got the dock right in your backyard  With the canal  And you get in your boat  And you putter out right there  It's great  But then when shit like this happens  Your whole house floods 
[03:22:00]  It's wonderful  It's gotta suck  It's great  Good trade off  So where are we at?  Where are we at?  Yo where are we at?  Beat breakfast bacon time  Beat breakfast bacon time  Where's this left turn?  Is it starting to turn left down?  I don't know  At 8 o'clock they said it was north-northwest  At 20 miles per  I guess  By 11  When the next update comes  We will really get an indication  As to whether this thing is making that turn or not  Yeah  Which will make it a lot uglier 
[03:22:30]  Yeah  Although even if it just kind of sails off to the northeast  It's still going to be just ugly  We would actually get more rain in that case  We would get a lot more rain  Less wind  And less surge  If it stayed out to sea  And the left side of the hurricane hit us  It would  It would be a little more  A little more rain  A lot more rain  And less wind  But now we're going to get a fuckload of wind  A lot of the storm surge  Long Island's going to be a fucking mess  Yeah 
[03:23:00]  South Shore and North Shore are going to be bad  That electricity's going to go out for a while  Oh man  That's a guarantee  Where's Travis that's so  That bad place  That's so  He's down on that little strip fucking  What's that called  It's not Long Beach is it  It's down there  Rockaway  Rockaway  Rockaway yeah yeah  It's pretty much the same thing  It's that little strip of fucking shit  That protects Long Island from hurricanes  They get it bad right  Yeah  Oh it's very tiny  Yeah little little sliver of land  Yeah  How wide is it 
[03:23:30]  It's only one foot wide  Tough place to live  Very hard to live there  You gotta sleep standing up  Yeah you gotta walk with your feet right in front of each other  Or you're in the ocean  Very hard  You should have heard brave Travis  Driving in  It was very funny  He was saying how if you know  If he didn't have the kid and the wife and everything  He'd have just fucking stayed in his apartment  And watched the ocean  Oh yeah  Like yeah but you know  He's a provider and stuff  So he's gotta like  You know take care of his family  And be responsible  But if not for that 
[03:24:00]  That motherfucker would have just been crazy  Probably doing keg stands  On the beach  As the waves are just fucking rolling over  So why didn't he just send the family to you  And then stay home  And fucking make some cool videos  Would you send your family to me  That's a good point  What's more dangerous  Only if I was John List  Or Scott Peterson  Too good  Yeah  No they're fun  You think you're gonna get in tomorrow  Well you know what  I don't wanna have to deal with all this shit 
[03:24:30]  Yeah  It's just a hassle  The roads are being taken away  It's a hassle  I don't know  It might be tough  Those roads get flooded  They do get flooded  But I'll say  I'll fucking  When I  Tonight I think we'll have pretty good indication  As to what's going on  And if everything's flooded  Or not  If I could drive in  If I drive in  We all make it in  If I can't drive in  Have fun  That's how this shit works  We didn't even get to play Meatloaf today  Aw  We got four minutes 
[03:25:00]  He loves your guy  Oh I know  I saw the clip  Meatloaf loves your guy  Did you see it?  He certainly does  Can we play it?  We got like a couple minutes left  Yeah  This went viral on Friday  I guess it was  Meatloaf's a lunatic  We kinda  Got a glimpse of that  When we interviewed him  Meatloaf's crazy  Bad shit  And his documentary they did on MSG  Bad out of hell shit  Was great  Really is great  This guy's a hypochondriac  Mmm  What happened? 
[03:25:30]  Advertisement  Gotta make that paper  What happened?  What happened?  We're waiting for the ad  Here we go  Uh oh  Pause  Yeah the set up is  You got a bunch of guys  You've seen their faces  But you don't know their names  And Meatloaf  You know any of those other guys?  That's Big and Rich right there 
[03:26:00]  Oh that's Big and Rich  Who's the other guy on the left?  Don't they do mornings here?  Big and Rich in the morning  Pew pew pew  Big and Rich  Who's the other guy?  I don't know who that guy is  Is he their sports guy?  Yeah  He's a stunt boy  But you've seen him before  I've seen that face  Anyway  End of some kind of Romney campaign speech  They get up there to do the patriotic song  Yep  And it starts off all nice  And then you'll know when Meatloaf pops in  If you haven't seen this clip yet  Oh God  Oh he tried way too high 
[03:26:30]  Everybody sing  Come on  America  America  God  God  Let his grace  So  Made 
[03:27:00]  All in front of my good  All from sea  All from sea  New shining sea  Robby's just waving  Robby doesn't know what to think of that  Guys  In all fairness  He is a stiff  John Rick  John Rick is just looking around like 
[03:27:30]  What the fuck is he doing?  That's Meatloaf  Meatloaf  He thinks he did a good job there  He didn't  Oh he thinks  Right  Wow  What a fucking mess  Did you ever see the documentary?  Uh no  MSG put this thing together  It's a couple hours 
[03:28:00]  It's well worth watching  He's sick before every show  And he has to be coddled by everybody  He's a lunatic  He's a lunatic  He's fucking crazy Meatloaf  He's a crazy motherfucker  In my humble opinion  Sick poppy  Fucking poppy  Jimmy had a successful run in Philly  Where are we off to next Jimmy?  Minnesota this Saturday  But that's sold out  Toronto the final  Friday November 9th  But that's almost sold out  Nice  You're going to Toronto with who? 
[03:28:30]  Just myself  I'm doing a gig  I want to go to Toronto  And I got Addison Improv  A couple weeks after that  Buffalo New Year's Eve  And I'm booking a Baltimore date  For early December  Nice  Good  Jim Norton everyone  Making some money  Still working hard  That's crazy  Why would you  Why?  Sal three months in  Shows you how it's done  Sal worked almost hard for three months  So now he's going to coast  Not even  Not even and almost?  He fooled people 
[03:29:00]  It's so funny  Because on Friday  I was thinking about how annoyed I was  That he even talked to me  About leaving at 1.30 in the afternoon  And then he left early  And I was like  That's why I get annoyed with him  And then today this  Look but that's  That's up to him man  I'll go back to when I was coming up again  I could have left  I knew  The longer I stayed around  This environment  I could probably learn a thing or two  About a thing or two  But he's already looking at the clock  As a 22 year old  Just starting out in this business  And he expects to  Make something of himself 
[03:29:30]  Crazy  Get the fuck out of here  If I just did what my salary position  Asks me to do  My days would be a breeze  You know how much less time I'd be here?  Yeah but you're trying to work on your own future  It's not working  Fucking idiot  You know it's stupid  Just an idiot  I know I am  Looking at the various models  Ed?  Where are these ladies?  They all have it  They all have it  Making that hard left turn  Yeah it's gonna  You're gonna be wrong on this one  What are you gonna do?  You're not wrong often  But I think  It was just a hunch  I think you put yourself out there 
[03:30:00]  I have no rhyme or reason to  I don't think that fucking  I still don't think it's turning  The president declared  A state of emergency  In five states  And D.C.  How about Benghazi?  Oh that's right  Hey he looks out  It happens  Yeah  Remember Slow News Day shit?  He looked out  Correctamundo  Remember what's his name?  Exactly  Cause 9-11 happened  Who?  Gary Condit  All those stories that were fucking happening right before 9-11  Remember those?  Goodbye  The bad thing about that was that  Gary Condit turned out to be innocent 
[03:30:30]  And no one knew  Cause the last thing they knew  Right  He was guilty as fuck  And then no one cared about him  And then they found the real killer  They found  It turned out he had nothing to do with it  And no one goes  Gary Condit  Oh the guy that killed that girl  Cause nothing made that news cycle  Nothing  For a year straight  Poor Gary Condit  You're right  Ended up in fucking South Park  With all the other murderer cartoon characters  You're right  It's great  You're absolutely right  Yeah  Alright I guess we're done for today  We even went a little late Sam 
[03:31:00]  Look at us  You guys did really great  Kenny's waiting with my car  Downstairs  Vroom vroom  The big hurricane  Oh and you get to leave with the party  Oh fucking A  The compound party car  Come on man  Me, Danny, Travis  We're all driving  Right now  The whole gang gets to leave  Right the fuck now  Nice  Yeah well  Queer brigade  Back to my home  Yeah  Stay tuned for the Abder show  With the only saps  That are sticking around here  Alright  Talent schedule  Yeah  Talent schedule  Talent schedule  How great is this

[03:32:00]  Me and you  I think  We're the closest  Yeah  Don't worry about it  I think I'll make it  Pull a cell  I know you'll try  But I think there'll be  Some crazy flooding  Just gonna go to sleep  Roland  Any updates  Riding  Rain and shit  Riding  What  Rain and shit  Rain and shit  And a lot of roast beef  Two and a half pounds  Does mail get delivered  During a hurricane  I think so  No  I think state employees  Are not coming in  Unless they're essential  If I express mail Troy 
[03:32:30]  Some extra grip tape  Do you think it'll be  In time for tomorrow  Oh man  You know what you could do  You could actually just  Cab it down to his place  Oh yeah  I forgot to  So many cabs  They're all over the place  It's way easy to get  From here  I wasn't that crazy  Those cabs  Alright I'm out of here  The Opie and Anthony show  Is available later today  With Sirius XM on demand  Alright you've heard about it  You've waited  Four long hours  For it  And now the moment  You've waited for  Rears it's ugly nose  Head  After Opie and Anthony live 
[03:33:00]  Is coming up next  Sirius XM  Hey hey hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  Continues  This is  After ONA live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  I gotta tell ya  We are live  It's Hurricane Sandy  Whoever this person is  Frankenstorm Sandy  We're live  After Opie and Anthony live  But I gotta tell you  In the eight minutes 
[03:33:30]  Since you last heard  The broadcast on the air  During that commercial break  Everybody around here  Scattered like cockroaches  We're literally down to me and E-Rock  We're the only ones left  Call me up  866-WOW-1-WOW  It is just me and you left here  Right Eric  Yes  Who's in there with you  Uh  Roland's uh  I guess making his way out  I don't know  In a few minutes  He's gotta go make sure  He has his hotel  Everybody's calling up 
[03:34:00]  I don't know what he just said  I'm just putting you on hold  So I'm putting you on hold  For a second  Don't hang up  If you're on hold  Because  We don't have a phone screener  So I'll get to you in a minute  But just a few  People  This is what happens  People call up  And then  They  I put them on hold  But since nobody said  Hold on  The minute they start hearing the show  They just hang up  Don't hang up  I'll get to you in a second  It's not about you  It's about the show  Um  Well I mean  We haven't really had to brave  Much of a storm yet 
[03:34:30]  It sounds like  We're going to tomorrow  I think Opie at least  Says he's planning on coming in  Um  Sal and Troy  Did not make it in  And I gotta say  For the record  Uh  I went very hard on Sal today  And that was  I think  Deserve it  But  Like  I like Sal and Troy  As people  I like hanging out with them  Troy's a great guy  But  I think Sal  Specifically  His work ethic  Is shit  And I feel like 
[03:35:00]  Troy and Sal  Was shitty  That they didn't come in  Everybody else  Found some way  To get here  You know  Of course  There are a million excuses  I could have given you  A million excuses  As to why I didn't come in  From Westchester  What makes it worse  Yeah  Is that  Alright look  They shut down  Mass transit  For those of you  Not in New York City  And don't know that  So subways  Buses  All that's down  Sal's across the river  So okay  It makes it a little bit  More difficult  But Troy's on the island  Yeah he's on the island  He didn't check the cab  He's not that far from here  And I mean  The fact of the matter is 
[03:35:30]  Let's be honest  If E-Rock had not made it in here  From Jersey today  You all know  I would have destroyed him  Annihilated him  And for good reason  But  That's not to say  Like  You know  There's no reason  That we just pick on E-Rock  You know  I mean  He technically  Probably does more  To warrant  Being picked on  Than anyone else  That's no offense  To you Nagel  But  You know  If somebody else  Is fucking up  We gotta tell them  They're fucking up  Right  Obi went a little easier 
[03:36:00]  On Troy today  Who missed  Coming in  But  And maybe  Obi's right  He said it's because  Troy's not like  A young hungry guy anymore  He's a little older  And he's set in his ways  And this is just what it is  Okay  Okay  But Sal  Can you imagine  A 22 year old  Not being like  Holy shit  I get to come into  This national  Huge radio show  You heard the show  On Friday  Joe DeRosa  Put Opie and Anthony  In the top five radio shows  Of all time  Now how much more  Can you ask for 
[03:36:30]  Area code 210  What's your name  Where are you from  Hey  It's Lady Trucker  My luck  This is just the luck  Of after Opie and Anthony  Live  What's up  Oh I'm just calling  Just to let you know  That I just  Your dedication  To work  Is your work  Ethnic  Is just wonderful  Did you just say  Work ethnic  I think you said  Work ethnic  Is that like a black joke  No I meant ethics  But yeah  We'll make it  Work ethnic 
[03:37:00]  I have that too  You can make it  A hair joke  You know  You do look like  A man of  Light color  I do work ethnic  Homie  Well I also want  To know that  He's just a  Super pussy  Super pussy  Indeed  Thank you Lady Trucker  Area code 606  Where's your name  Where are you from  All that  What's up buddy  I just want to let you know  Nothing has made me  Angrier on the show  Than listen to  Sounds  Fucking self entitled  Fucking bullshit  Wasn't it amazing 
[03:37:30]  That it just  None of it seemed  To really penetrate  Like none of it  Seemed to  He's a lazy fucking asshole  That needs to be shot  And killed  And buried in the river  That's what you would do  Yep  Have a nice day  Alright buddy  586  It's Jason from Detroit sir  What's up buddy  I just  I'm shocked  At how much  Sal has fallen  I mean  When he was first  There as an intern  We all hated Matt  Because Sal was  Such a hard worker  He's become Matt  And I couldn't believe it  But he is 
[03:38:00]  And I want to thank you  For calling him out  For all the bullshit  That he's trying to pull  Well I think like  That's something  That I mean you know  That's something  That we should do  All the time on the show  I think that's the purpose  Of the show  Is just to call out bullshit  And whether it's happening  In the news media  Or it's happening  With our guys  You call out  When you see bullshit  You let people  Defend themselves  And if you're wrong  You're wrong  But you call out bullshit  And that's what it is  And that's what  This scenario was  I don't know  What happened to Sal  He did  I mean  Maybe we just got  The wrong impression of him 
[03:38:30]  It seemed like  He was a very hard worker  When he was an intern  Maybe it was because  He was compared to people  Who were retards  I don't know for sure  But something happened  And then boom  517  You're on after  Open Anthony Live  Hey this is Mike  In Virginia  What's up Mike  Sam  Thank you for highlighting  All this bullshit  Dave  One thing is  I want to know  What does it take  To become an intern  Because I want  Sal's fucking job  It doesn't take much  To tell you the truth  I mean you've seen  The interns come by here  Do I need to be  In college actively 
[03:39:00]  Or can I be  That's  A regular smoke  No the only thing  Is that you need  To be earning  College credit  Now some people  They enroll in like  Connecticut School of Broadcasting  Or something like that  And then you get  College credit forever  But uh  Yeah you just need  To earn college credit  For it and that's it  Oh shit  Well I'm  I'm doing this  Because Sal's a fucking  Dumbass  I'm telling you  He  He set the bar  Look when I was an intern  And also when I was new  And trying to like  You know  Figure out my way  And get ahead and everything  My whole shit  Was being happy 
[03:39:30]  That people were not good  Because then it would  Give me the chance  To trump them  And I guess that's  What you're seeing with Sal  Yeah absolutely  And I worked pretty hard  I actually just got a call  From my supervisor  At work  Saying that she might  Have to take me out of here  Because of the fucking  Non-existent storm  Here in Virginia  And I'm pissed about that  But I worked pretty hard  I'm 26 now  And to be fair  When I was 22  I was pretty much  Just like Sal  I was a spoiled  Rich white suburban kid  Well when did you  When did you change  Probably within the last  Couple of years 
[03:40:00]  And why was that  Well partially  Because my parents  Started to cut me off  A little bit here and there  And it just kind of  Forced me to grow up  And I got married recently  And so I'm trying to  Like step up  Because of that as well  That's what you need to do  And that's what  Opie needs to do too  Because Opie now  Is in a situation  Where he didn't  Opie wasn't raised  With money  But he's got money now  He's got these two kids  And the thing is  That yes  You should take care  Of your kids  Opie should be starting  Bank accounts  For like college  And all that stuff  To make sure his kids  Are taken care of 
[03:40:30]  But you can't give them  Access to it  And you can't  Dig them out of every  Hole they're in  You can't  You know what I mean  Like you make sure  That if you pay  For your kids school  Is you can afford it  You should  Like that  That totally works  I don't think that  Leads to anybody's  Entitlement  But you shouldn't  Like once they get  Out of school  They gotta go find jobs  Yeah  You know  And it's like  When they're in high school  If they want money  Like make them get a job  When they're in high school  You know  Yeah  Unfortunately I wasn't  Raised quite like that  And I squandered 
[03:41:00]  All my college money  On a fucking culinary school  That I bombed out of  In like six months  But  You know  Fuck it  I know I can work  Way harder than myself  Yeah I bet you could  Thanks buddy  Alright thanks  What's up  I've been getting  Through email  And Twitter  Contacts from interns  I don't even remember  And ones that we didn't like  Like who  That we never told them  I couldn't even tell you  They was like  I used to intern  And he listed some details  I was like okay  I guess he did  Asking what the fuck 
[03:41:30]  Was up with Sal  And if that job  Was really open  Wow  So people really  Like there are people  Clamoring for that position  Remember the one  That never finished  Cause he was working  At Apple  Oh I hated that kid  He still calls me  He's probably hearing  That right now  It's true  Don't call me  And ask for an explanation  Either  He reached out  A couple guys  I swear I had no clue  They must have been  At K-Rock or something  Really?  Yeah  Well I mean  That's the thing  That kind of bugs me too  Is that I don't think  Sal real  And that's the thing 
[03:42:00]  That makes the Sal thing  Worse than the Troy thing  Is that at least Troy  Like Troy's kind of  Fed up with the whole thing  And that's why  He's lost his  His smile  I don't know if it's his smile  But he's at least  Lost some of that hunger  When he's around here  Because he's lost  What he had at one point  Which is understandable  I get that  But to just come in  And not have it  You know what I mean?  To just not be hungry  When you arrive  Is like  What are you even  Coming to dinner for?  You know what I'm saying?  How long can we keep  This metaphor going?  If he's just using this job  To fund his other project 
[03:42:30]  Like you said earlier  Alright so be it  But if you're not  Balancing the two  Right I mean  The bottom line is  If you want to make money  Outside of here  That's fine  But that's a hobby  Anything that's outside  Of this place  Is a hobby  So this place  Should always come first  Period  Are you going to get here tomorrow?  As far as I know  I will be here tomorrow  What are you going to do?  I'm going to  No I'm going to get up  Probably like four  You can drive it home though?  I'll see how the night goes  If it's really bad  I'll see 
[03:43:00]  No I'll get up  Earlier  Just like when  We have those little  Mini blizzards  That come up here  You've got to get up early  Dig the car out  Or what have you  You're not going to  Do the hotel?  No I can't  I can't leave my wife  By herself  That's why  Jess is here  You can hang out  Up here Jess  You can sit at the table  If you want  Jess is here  She's annoyed  About the whole thing  Because she was like  You know  She doesn't want to be  Left alone either  In the apartment  And I'm sure she  I mean even though  It's nice that you have it  I'm sure she doesn't  Really want to spend  You know  A night or two  Stuck in the city  No she wants to 
[03:43:30]  She wants to be at home  Because you're not even  Going to do fun stuff  You're just  There's nothing to do  That's the only thing  Like we'll get out of here  I mean we'll try to get out  Of the studio early today  Not quite as early  As everybody else  For me and you  You rocked  Iron men  I'm doing Sal's job  By the way  You are  He's cleaning up  The studio right now  Well we see  We can take care of it  Everything's covered  Yeah I guess  We'll try to get out of here  But the  Like once we get out of here  We're going to end up  Just sitting in a hotel  From noon onward  From 1230 onward  But every time  We get out of here 
[03:44:00]  You bring your playstation  No I got a laptop  I should have brought my playstation  I could play WWE 13  That game is great  And game kicks ass  And what's Roland doing  Still roaming around here  Just tell him to hang out  In the studio  If he's going to be here  I think he's got his cold cuts  Oh yeah  To get his meats  His lunch meats  That was when we said  He had a pound  And it's two and a half pounds  Of each  Yeah  Yeah it's five pounds  It's $40 worth of lunch meats  I thought you were leaving  I am  Because they're going to  Try shutting down the bridges soon  They're shutting down the bridges  Yeah  What if they shut down the tunnels 
[03:44:30]  Yes I would just end the show  Because  Well I'm not going to end  The after show  I'm here  Oh sucker  That's the whole reason  I came in  Yeah I'm going to leave now  So I go back to  Long Island City  Back to the  See this is what's fucked up  Because  I would rather go home today  Yeah  But I got to be here  In case there's a show  But if Opie and Jim  If Anthony is stuck on Long Island  That's one thing  If Opie and Jim also  Don't come in to do a show  Then I just stayed in the city  For no reason 
[03:45:00]  Yeah  And it's not like  It's the city city  It's the city  You know  In the middle of a hurricane  You can't go out  No  You're going back home  Yeah because  I mean  Eric's going back home  Yeah because  I didn't get approved  A hotel room  No  How come  I just put guests  I guess that's true  So what they say  I mean you don't know  How to do anything around here  I mean yeah  That's true though  Yeah  But that's by design  You don't want to know  How to do anything around here  Do you  That's not what he was hired  Yeah  But he also doesn't want  To learn anything  Which is smart  Because I don't want 
[03:45:30]  To learn anything new either  Yeah  I try not to learn  Any behind the scenes  Can you run the board  If you don't have anybody here  Absolutely not  I have no clue how to do it  Yeah I remember  And I don't want to learn  I remember you never wanted to learn  Yeah because I don't have any interest  In being more behind the scenes  Hands on  That's a blessing and a curse  Why did it  No no not on your end  Okay  But learning everything here  Right for you you mean  Like Ope said  Growing up  I was one of those guys  That I've worked Christmas  I've worked holidays  Slept here and done stuff like that  Yeah  And you learn a little of everything  If not everything  Then you become the guy that  Oh everyone else doesn't know 
[03:46:00]  So they can  They can just  Oh I mean trust me  I spent years  Learning how to do everything  Yeah  But then I got to a point  Where I'm like  Okay it's time to weed out  Like I'm here here  Like I was learning everything  When I was in Sal's position  Because I had to cement myself  Into this thing  I had to become  I had to become somebody  Who was needed  Right  Yeah  And so once I'm cemented in  It's like okay  Let me figure out what I'm good at  Let me figure out what I want to do  And let me weed the other stuff out  And not learn anything  I don't want to learn anymore  So I try to stay away 
[03:46:30]  From behind the scenes stuff now  And I try to learn more  The on air stuff  I'm trying to figure out  How to do a show  That's the whole point  Of the after show  So I can figure out  How to do  Obviously I haven't figured  It all out yet  Because I'm terrible  But I'm getting there  I thought the after show  The point of the after show  Was to talk about  What happened on the  Open Athlete show  The point of the after show  Is to further my own career  That's what I've noticed  I think that's been  Well established  The point of the after show  Is to prove to  Program directors here and elsewhere  That you know  I'm awesome 
[03:47:00]  It hasn't worked  Yet but I'm working on it  So Roland you're not  Going to be in tomorrow  Fuck no  If they want to play this game  I'll play the game better  You see  If we had called Sal  And we had been like  Sal did you try to get in  And he had been like  Fuck no  And then hug out  Right  Then it would have been like  Okay I respect the kid  He's got bulls  Alright well let's see  Who's on  631  You're on the air  Sam  What's up buddy  It's Paul from Long Island  I just wanted to give you 
[03:47:30]  A storm update  Yeah  Suffolk County  Yeah  I don't know how fast  They're going  But the winds are so crazy  The leaves are coming  Off the trees  Oh so this shit is going down  I've never seen  Anything like this  Except for  Every year  At this time  When you say  The leaves are coming  Off the trees  You mean because  It's autumn  Oh is that right  Yeah  I mean it's  It's no no no  It's getting towards  The end of fall  So that is actually  Quite normal  Oh my bad then  It's fine out here  Okay  Thank you very much 
[03:48:00]  Thanks buddy  530  What's your name  Where are you calling from  Hey what's up  Hey uh  I just want to say  Fuck you  To uh  It's not the F  You can't answer  A simple question  570  Jay and Tampa  Hey don't  Well done Jay  How you doing  Alright listen  Anthony's wrong  About the storm  Because it's going to make  Three rights make a left  Of course  Well that's  That's a safer way 
[03:48:30]  To do it  It's not going to  Appear to be making  A left turn at first  But three rights  Do make a left  Thanks buddy  That's an old school  Listener right there  Roland you probably  Had no fucking idea  What he's talking about  No I don't give a fuck  You don't give a fuck  Nah  Are you happy  That you get the  Get the day off tomorrow  Now is it  It's not my choice  It's their choice  Is it a day off  Or is it more just like  Look you know  We may be running  Bare bones tomorrow  We don't have any guests  Don't worry about it  That type of thing  Yeah  Okay  I mean I get that  Yeah 
[03:49:00]  Cause like  So you specifically  Do not want to learn like  The weird radio stuff  Fuck them  Associated with the show  Yeah my ball sack  Will learn  Your ball sack  And your ball sack  Has terrible short term memory  So it's really tough  To teach at anything  Yeah  I mean that's smart  And it's not like  That's your job anyway  You book guests  You do a good job at that  Who were you supposed to have today  Larry King  Larry King was supposed to be in today  Yeah he left Saturday night to LA  I know I was supposed to interview  Run from Run DMC 
[03:49:30]  For my show  Later on today  But he cancelled too  A lot of people cancelled  And I would assume  Even more are gonna cancel tomorrow  Yeah  So that's not even a worry  I wouldn't be surprised  And then the week will be iffy  Because like  People have to fly in right  Yeah  And it's not  I mean how are they gonna do that  They're cancelling planes everywhere  I see management left too  Some people  Who left in management  I know I see people running around  I guess they have to  Shit to do  I don't know if anybody left  For sure  You think so  I think so  I would too  Well you're about to leave right 
[03:50:00]  Yeah I'm done  Uh  Westchester  914  Hey Sam  It's Corey  How are you  Where are you from Corey  I'm from Yonkers  What's up buddy  I always see you at autograph signings  And things like that  Like I saw you at the punk signings  Oh cool man  Uh  No forget about all this talk  Let's talk Hell in a Cell last night  Hell in a Cell  The WWE pay per view  Uh  It was good  I mean it wasn't  It was  The Big Show won the title  Big Show was in here  On uh  What was it  Wednesday or Thursday 
[03:50:30]  And he went on  And he won the championship  At Hell in a Cell  Uh  What did you think  That was probably one of the best  Matches on the card  The Seamus Big Show match  Yeah  After it picked up  And stuff like that  Yeah  Uh  What did you think of  Ryback  He was he  Ryback is like a new guy  And they're trying to push him  He was fighting  CM Punk  For the WWE championship  He didn't win the belt  But  He got the moral victory  I'd say  They were up on top of the cage  And everything  Yeah I was glad Ryback  Didn't go over  Cause I think he's just lame 
[03:51:00]  And right now  He's the cross between  You know like  Goldberg and Rob Van Dam  With the airbrush  Yeah it's true  Actually I'm glad you called  Thanks buddy  Um  No problem  Because I wanted to play for you  Everybody was talking about  The Big Show coming in  And they all wanted  Stone Cold E.T. to be brought up  You remember Stone Cold E.T.  We brought him up  Well  Uh  Last weekend  CM Punk did a signing  At Caroline's  And the video is up  And the video is up on YouTube  At YouTube  Slash NotSam  Probably NotSam.com too  Um  But yeah  Check out the video  Cause the video  I interviewed him  And the video is very funny 
[03:51:30]  Because he starts the interview  By stomping on my foot  And he ends the interview  By smacking me in the back  Of the head  And I'm sure that  There are many of you  Who have waited a long time  To see a wrestler  Smacking me in the back  Of the head  So uh  Check that out now  On YouTube  But  I did get to ask  CM Punk  About Stone Cold E.T.  So here's uh  Here's Punk  On the YouTube phenomenon  What's the haps?  You got breaking news  What?  It's the same thing  You answered the last time  I asked you  What?  Did you say that?  What's the haps? 
[03:52:00]  Why do you say that?  Because it's my thing  You're a bad interviewer  What's the haps?  CM Punk didn't like  The what's the haps question  No  I want to ask you  The question that's  On everybody's mind  What are your thoughts  On Stone Cold E.T.  Is that what's on  Everybody's mind?  You've seen it on YouTube  Right?  I actually take credit  For blowing that thing up  Yeah?  Yeah  Oh yeah  Absolutely  I um  Got everybody in the back  Watching it  I think Stone Cold E.T.  Was hilarious  Apparently there's  Some other YouTubes  On the same guy  Does some other stuff 
[03:52:30]  Yeah  None of them are quite as good  That's what I mean  I'm not even  I'm not even going to  Taint Stone Cold E.T.  With watching  Whatever else he does  Yeah  It's Stone Cold E.T.  Or nothing  I actually have a picture  Of Stone Cold E.T.  On my phone  You do?  Yeah  Just for  Prosperities  Prosperities  I just like to send it to people  Posterity  Was the word I was going for  But yeah  You can check out  You can check out  The whole interview  At my YouTube page  Not Sam  But yeah  Punk  You see what happens  When the Opie and Anthony show  And CM Punk  Gets behind you  You get some major views 
[03:53:00]  Stone Cold E.T.  If you haven't seen it by now  That is a hilarious video  What's the breaking news Roland?  I got a big guest tomorrow  Who is it?  Sal  I don't know if even you  Are good enough to book Sal in here  That's the rumor though  The panky piece texting me  Sal is texting you?  Yeah  Like where hotel  I need to book a hotel  Tell him to fucking  This is another  What's he calling  Tell him  To go on the internet  Right in Times Square Hotel  Call them  And book a room 
[03:53:30]  And the lovely Troy Kwan  Said he'll take me in tonight  What's that mean?  That does nothing for you  Troy Kwan couldn't make it here  When there wasn't a storm  I know but  Noah show me pictures  Of her place  What's going on with the river  It's going all the way  Into the park  Oh so you're just  Trying to get out of there  Well if Troy Kwan  Couldn't make it to work today  How are you going to  Make it to his apartment?  We both don't give a fuck  Whatever that means  Let's go to 917  Hey what's up Sam 
[03:54:00]  What's your name?  I'm right over here  On 93rd in Amsterdam  I work at a school  So this place is a shelter  But I had 60 year olds  Walking 50 blocks  Just to come here  And volunteer  And that was this morning?  Yeah yeah  I've been here all night  I haven't left for three days  But Roland's a sweetheart man  I met him on 72nd street  And Broadway  And he's one of the nicest guys  From the show  He's a good guy man  Oh yeah  Later Sam  Alright buddy  60 year olds are walking  Blocks and blocks and blocks  Forget that  Look at the immigrants 
[03:54:30]  When they first moved  Like the Italians first  Landed in New York  They walked everywhere  Yeah Sal  What would your immigrants  Your immigrant ancestors  Think of you?  5-6-7  What's your name?  Where are you from?  I'm from Ohio  What's up buddy?  I just passed WWE headquarter  And it's just windy  It's all get out  Other than that  It's fine  Were they talking about  My interview with CM Punk at all?  Could you hear anything?  No but I didn't see Big Show  Up on the top throw  And see him come down  I don't think that's true  I don't think that's true  At all 
[03:55:00]  718 you're on the show  Calls go crazy  This is Sammy from Queens  What's up buddy?  Calls go crazy  When they find out  There's no phone screener  How you doing?  Forget about the storm  Forget about Sal  Forget about wrestling  How's the lovely Jess?  I haven't heard her voice  On the radio  Since the Sam and Dave show  How's your wife doing?  Come here  Put on  You got headphones over there?  Put on  Or go over to that mic then  Where there's headphones  What's your name again sir?  Sammy from Queens  Sammy from Queens 
[03:55:30]  He's been a while  He hasn't heard Jess  She's on the Sunday show  Every now and again  I know  I know  But let's get her on the air now  Enough of the sound of the storm  Alright maybe you're right  You don't want to hear any more  About CM Punk?  After I hear Jess's voice  Yes you can  Okay it's on YouTube  That com slash not Sam  That's not Sam  I'll look it up  Alright  Sammy from Queens  Is anxious to hear  How you're doing Jess  Hey Sammy  It's nice to hear from you  Hi Jess how you doing?  I'm alright  How's everything going with Sam?  How's the marriage going?  The marriage is going alright 
[03:56:00]  Oh very good  You sound a little tired dear  Yeah I didn't sleep that well last night  No?  Yeah  We stayed in this hotel  Let me tell you this Sammy  We stayed in this hotel  In Times Square  And these fucking idiots  We go to bed around 11  And I guess they make paper thin doors  At this hotel  Because these morons  Are outside of our room  Gallivanting in the hallways  In Halloween costumes  As if we don't have a hurricane coming  And people aren't trying to get some sleep  As if it's not Sunday 
[03:56:30]  Before the big Monday  You know work week begins  You know they're gallivanting  They're making all kinds of noise  They're yelling  They're taking pictures of each other  In the mirror  We just had to leave the bed  And be like  What are you guys doing?  Sam you know what it is?  They're probably tourists  They don't know any better  Well I hope  Hopefully  Really good point  Hopefully they will not have a hotel  So they'll be walking around today  Trying to figure out  What the best sights are to see  And the hurricane  Will simply wash them away forever  And without Roker 
[03:57:00]  Without Roker  Well listen  I want to wish you and Jess  The best  And a long married life  Thank you very much  Thank you Sammy  Thank you Sammy  Alright  Talk to you later  Jess what did you think  Of my great CM Punk interview?  Fabulous  As always  Were you enthralled  At his thoughts  On Stone Cold E.T.  Yes  That he started it  Well that he  Pretty remarkable  That he you know  Launched it  Yes  That's what he says  I think he was doing it  Before I brought it to O&A  I'm just glad he followed you though  Your line of questioning  What do you 
[03:57:30]  Like he didn't  Like he wasn't like  What are you talking about?  Because yeah  Because everybody's talking about him  In Stone Cold  Steve Austin  Right  So when I threw the E.T. at him  You don't know  You don't know  Sammy's gonna throw curveballs though  That's the only thing about Sam Roberts  From Queens  No no no no  Oh  From Westchester  This one right here  Let's see  920  By the way  I've heard  That Sirius XM  Gauges like listenership  Based on phone response  Let me tell you something  All I do is say  Hey call up if you want to 
[03:58:00]  And these phones  Have been blazing through this show  And everybody that calls up here  Is like  Hey Sam  Love ya buddy  Should we give a hurricane prize?  I don't know if we have any  The prize of this hurricane  Is just surviving  What's up?  920  Whoa you're on the air  Hey Sammy  Hey Jess  Hey Roland  It's Pirate Trucker  Pirate Trucker  How's it going?  I pulled a cell today  I'm running three hours behind  And I don't know how  Just don't know how it happened?  I don't know how it happened  I'm headed to upstate New York 
[03:58:30]  Which is another bonus  You're supposed to have  High wind, rain, and snow  Yeah that's everywhere  That's supposed to have that  That's not like  A special upstate thing  Tom  You know  You should just go nuts  Since nobody's there  Take over the station  And broadcast during the hurricane  That's true  That's a great idea  Thank you Pirate Trucker  Where's E-Rock?  Where did E-Rock go?  Is E-Rock in there anymore?  No he's not  He probably had to hear a poo poo  He probably disappeared  To start working on the replay  Or something  They leave me alone here  I'm the one last man surviving 
[03:59:00]  You know if Ron and Fez are live today?  I don't know  Fuck it  Somebody tell Gary  We gotta get in here  We're doing hurricane coverage  24 hours a day  If I'm gonna get stuck in the city  We might as well be broadcasting  Or we go see a movie  And have a lunch  Yeah  Okay well I didn't know  That was also an option  Is there a movie option?  Yeah  Okay maybe we'll go see the movie instead  I think actually the listeners  Would probably prefer  That we go see a movie  Than me broadcast  For the next 24 hours  They want to make sure  You're safe in your hotel 
[03:59:30]  Yeah I don't even have a hotel yet  Eric are Ron and Fez live today?  I don't think so  Alright then we're doing this  Sal is coming tomorrow  No he's not  He's a fucking moron  Then we're doing this  Tell him we don't need him  Yeah  We're rolling  He already booked a hotel so  He's got the cash  Tell him we don't need him  They approved him though  We don't need him  He said it himself on the air  He didn't think he was that necessary  Anybody  Let me tell you something  Anybody who's been working  At a place  For less than a year  And they come out  And they say  I didn't think I was that necessary  Well then why the fuck 
[04:00:00]  Are you hired in the first place?  My first vacation in the industry  Was five years into it  Five years  And I took two days off  And I was scared  Right  Because you're like  I'm going to be replaced  You wouldn't call up your job  And be like  I'm not necessary right?  No if I did that  I would have been fired  Exactly  That aside  You've been working here  A long long time  That's right  Is it not terrifying  To take a sick day  Or a day off  From this show?  I mean Jess  I was talking about you earlier  About how you wanted to take a  Did you not want to take  A 14 day honeymoon? 
[04:00:30]  Yes I did  Like any other rational  Problem going on their honeymoon  Did we not  How many arguments  Did we have  Over the  Is this the hotline line 10?  No but it's  A different line  Oh  Hello  You're on after  Obi and Anthony live  Sam  Yeah  Sal  Sal  Hi  What a disappointment  You were today  I know  It's balls to call in  Without being called  I'll give you that  No no no  I just want to tell you  I am coming into the city  I got a hotel room  And everything  How are you getting in? 
[04:01:00]  I'm going to  I'm going to have to call a cab  I'm going to like  You know  Get all my shit together  And then I'm going to call a cab  But I thought  You said yourself  Is it bad over there?  That you weren't that necessary  Uh  Yeah  But I  I need to come in now  So I'm coming in  Alright well I mean  Is it a bad cell there or no?  Oh dude  It's crazy  There's nothing  There's nothing going on  It's just really  It's just really windy  But there's nothing like major  Do you feel like an asshole?  Get your little cannolis here  I feel like an asshole  Every day  And yeah  Do you think it's justified 
[04:01:30]  Or do you think we're just  That the show's just busting your balls  Because we get off on it?  I think it's a little bit of both  But you know  What am I going to do?  I think it's justified  Do you?  I do  Yeah  Um  Troy didn't get his balls  Troy didn't make it in either  He didn't get his balls busted  Quite as hard as you  But that's also because  Uh  I think Opie thinks that Troy  After these  So many years  Like Troy's a good what?  He's over 10 years older than you  Correct?  Troy's uh 
[04:02:00]  Yeah  Yeah  I think he's like 12 years older than me  Yeah  Right  So we figure that Troy's just kind of given up  He's just thrown in the towel  He's just you know  This is what I am  But that's unacceptable  From somebody who's just cutting his teeth  Yeah  I mean  I hope  You know  I definitely have to learn a lot  From what he said today  Light a fire under my ass a little bit more  No  But  Yeah  Well  I would say coming in tomorrow  Would probably be the right thing to do  But I would also say  That this isn't going to go away for a while  No I know  You got a lot of proving yourself to do  That's what I figured 
[04:02:30]  Like I might as well  Maybe if your mom  Does strip  Do you uh  You hear all the  Old interns and stuff  Are trying to get your job now?  Uh no  I wasn't listening  I was trying to book a  Get a room and shit  Did you get a room?  Yeah  I'm actually staying at your place  Oh okay  Um  Well did  Pat  Well Pat Duffy called in while you were on  But there's all  Eric says all the old interns  Have been twittering him  And emailing him  All being like  Hey  Is that job really opening up?  Are you going to quit? 
[04:03:00]  No I'm not  Why would I want to quit?  It's a fucking great job  I don't want to quit  Wow  It's a great job the way you do it  It's easy as pie  Uh  That's what I understand  Is it?  No  Alright well Sal  Listen  Good luck trudging through  The perilous weather  That you're going to have to  Trudge through to make it into Manhattan  For my  For me  I truly hope that they  Cancel the show tomorrow  Only so that you  Went and got a hotel  For nothing  But they  They paid for the hotel  It doesn't matter  Well it does matter 
[04:03:30]  Because it's going to be a hassle  Sal obviously doesn't want to do it  And  He won't even get the credit of  Hey I made it in the second day  Because they'll be like  Who cares  There was no show  Yeah but  It's pretty nice  They said the only room they have  Like the cheapest room  Was the one with the  Sal you should have heard me  For the closing bridges  What did you say Sal?  I said the cheapest room they had  And I was calling a few hotels  The one that  They're like  Oh you know  You got a king sized bed  And all that stuff  So maybe it's not too bad  Then  Cheapest room  What are you doing? 
[04:04:00]  Somebody else footing the bill  Most expensive room  Is the room you should be asking for  You got any suites?  No I'm not trying to be  You know  Gluttonous like that  I'll just take  Whatever they'll give me  I'll be happy with it  Alright  Somebody is eating  A slice of humble pie today  I have to  After today  Alright buddy  Well  As I said on the air  I don't dislike you  As a human being  But  I strongly disagree  With this  And some of your other actions  That you've done here at work  Alright well  I'm trying to make it up to you  Maybe 
[04:04:30]  Maybe we'll hang out  Later tonight  Maybe we will  But I will expect  Some kind of a blowjob  By your mom  And if your mom  Is your mom worried about you?  No  She's fine  She's just too busy  Fingering herself to bury Manilow  Yeah she's busy  Like rocking out to  No not rocking out  Masturbating  Alright thank you Sal  Alright I'll see you guys later  Alright bye  But yeah  Jess you were saying before  You wanted to do 
[04:05:00]  A 14 day honeymoon  Yes I did  How many arguments  Did we have  I started campaigning  When did we get married  In June?  Yeah  I started campaigning  Maybe in January  That's right  Before  No before  Probably  Yeah  But two weeks is fair though  All the Sundays she gives up  So you figure two weeks  Isn't that  We compromised that nine days  And that was a major compromise  Was it not  It was such a compromise  Other people had to weigh in  We like had to have moderators  Yeah  I was done two weeks  And you figure she gives her Sundays  How many times do you do  A two week honeymoon?  Zero  Right  Yeah but you can find  Somebody to marry you Roland 
[04:05:30]  I'll find a Russian wife  I'll lower my standards  You've given up  How much time do we have left Eric?  You have two minutes  Alright then we can take another phone call  Why you don't  Why don't you like  No no no not you  Not you  I just got an update  From who?  Just the news  They're closing one of the tunnels  Bro you gotta get a hotel  At two o'clock  If you're coming  I have time  If you're coming in tomorrow  You're staying in a hotel  Don't get a hotel  Sal's coming in  You're covered  Okay good  Are you gonna get a hotel?  No I can't 
[04:06:00]  You're not gonna be here  He has to go back  I have to go back  He can't leave Ange  Tell Ange to come here  I can't  We have pets and everything  You got cats  Cats take care of  Let him go home  Cats are self sufficient  Go home  Oh man I'm gonna kill you tomorrow Eric  Go home  We're going home too  Your point of view would be different  Once you own your own house  Oh cause you're worried about the house getting messed up?  Yeah I'm in a park with huge oak trees too  Okay that I can buy  The cat thing I will not accept  But  I'm not gonna leave them there alone  They'll be fine  But  Damage to your house 
[04:06:30]  Maybe  But I can probably argue that too  Go home Sam  Let's all go home and be safe  440  Yes  Jess is so pissed off right now  440  And she's cranky  Cause she didn't sleep  440  Sam this is Tony from Cleveland  What's up man?  What's up Tony?  Hey uh  Just to let you know  I think I deserve a hurricane prize  Because last week  When Bobo was calling  As the mayonnaise piece  The reason he wasn't doing very good  Is cause I was calling  And blowing up the shit again  Like I always do  Do you have his phone number saved in your phone? 
[04:07:00]  Yeah I'm the one that's always fucking with him  Every time he calls you guys  And I'm the one that has him call in studio  For no reason  You're a real  You're a real son of a bitch Tony  Uh there's nothing better  Then I'll call him whatever  Remember the one time you guys had the intern in studio  And Bobo said that he called him?  Yeah  That was me  You guys just tortured this poor kid  Thank you Tony  I don't have any hurricane prizes  But he saves everybody's numbers too  Who Bobo does?  Bobo  If anyone calls him  He puts that number right in his phone  We have no  Like we don't talk to Bobo in the air  Barely ever anymore  T-Twitters by just ignoring  You listeners just torture the kid 
[04:07:30]  Unbelievable  Alright well listen  I'm assuming there'll be a show tomorrow  I don't think there will be  You don't?  No  Oh fuck  I got a decision to make  I say go home  Thank you  Worst case scenario  You miss the show  Jess  You've been with me for how long?  Over seven years  Eric is telling me in my earphone  Go home  Thank you Eric  He said  He just whispered it  I'm drinking iced tea here  Thank you  He loves his iced tea  He can't have water  Needs a little powder in there  No he doesn't like the taste  No  Yeah he needs a little treat for himself 
[04:08:00]  He's just happy  Go home  Real quick  Maybe two weeks  Let's go home  Here's the quick question  Yeah  You've known Eric for how long?  Seven years  How much does he love treats?  Very much  Okay  That's not an insult  You love treats  It's a correct observation  Now that that's out of the way  We've been together for how long?  God over seven years  Right  Right  Now  What do you think?  There's a possibility that the show is going to happen tomorrow  Yeah  I think so  Do you think I'm going home? 
[04:08:30]  I'm so mad right now  You've probably answered your own question  We're sleeping in a hotel tonight  I know  Okay  I'm done  I'll see if I can find a nice luxurious hotel  And by the way Gary  If you get upset about my hotel bill  You just listen to this audio  My wife's very upset  I have to get a very nice suite  You know some people that live in town  You should just go home  Hmm?  Go home  I don't think so  We'll probably be back tomorrow  Because Hurricane Sandy can suck a dick  Well I gotta suck a dick  Because I ain't getting proof for a hotel  Stay tuned
