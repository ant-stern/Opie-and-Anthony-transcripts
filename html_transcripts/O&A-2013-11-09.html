<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting the "Worst of the Week Countdown," showcasing highlights from the week's interviews.  This included in-studio appearances by Adewale Agbaje (Adebisi from *Oz*, promoting *Thor*), who recounted humorous anecdotes about filming *Thor* in Iceland, particularly the fight choreography; Jason Statham (promoting *Homefront*), who discussed his career, a reported feud between Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone, and his past reckless driving; and Julius "Dr. J" Erving, who promoted his autobiography, discussed his career highlights, including a recent dunk at 63, and his surprisingly modest NBA salary despite giving away millions.  Other guests mentioned in this segment included Bill Burr, Colin Quinn, and interviews with Oliver Stone and Guillermo del Toro.  The segment featured frequent coarse language and humor, notably including an on-air incident where a caller, “Lady Di,” inadvertently revealed her phone number on Twitter. The hosts attempted to help her rectify this, leading to a chaotic and humorous sequence resulting in her number being widely disseminated.

Dr. J's extended interview delved into his early career struggles despite impressive college stats, his time playing overseas, the origin of his nickname "Dr. J," his financial decisions including significant charitable giving and some bad investments, his relationship with a woman named Samantha and the resulting child support arrangements, and a comparison of his upbringing to that of his children.

Guillermo del Toro's in-studio appearance covered his childhood love of monster movies, a memorable incident involving urine, his “monster house” with secret passages and a “Rain Room,” and his father's 72-day kidnapping in Mexico. Del Toro also humorously discussed his strategic purchase of the house next door to avoid neighborhood suspicions about alleged porn production.

Oliver Stone's scheduled appearance was significantly delayed, leading to humorous debate among the hosts and Sam Roberts about whether to wait.  Ultimately, they left the studio early due to scheduling conflicts, recalling previous instances where they left before guests like Ricky Gervais and James Cromwell arrived.  However, Stone eventually arrived, and a lengthy post-show interview with Sam Roberts ensued, covering Stone’s documentary "Untold History of the United States," his views on historical figures (particularly Truman and Eisenhower), the JFK assassination, and his filmmaking career.  A final segment included Bill Burr, who joined Sam Roberts for a discussion that included an anecdote about a less-than-enthusiastic encounter with Don Cheadle and a digression about Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe.

The show included several commercial breaks featuring advertisements for Sirius XM, Retro Fitness, credit repair services, Dish Network, Anchor Funding Services, Cheapoware.com, cigars, a matchmaking service, Viagra, tax relief, audiobooks, Dollar Shave Club, business phone systems, weight-loss products, and life insurance.

A "Friends of the Show" segment featured Tom Papa's Sirius XM show, "Come to Papa," which included a racially charged comedic bit with Jim Norton, Kurt Metzger, Keith Robinson, and Godfrey portraying a fictional first jazz band, a comedic performance by Lou Soloff, a tribute to Louis Armstrong with racially charged humor featuring a celebrity impersonator, and a skit involving a jazz club bouncer. Andy Rooney's impersonation concluded the segment.

The broadcast also included a segment with comedian Rich Vos, whose highly profane stand-up set covered various topics, including offensive jokes about midgets, pedophiles, and priests, criticisms of Keith Robinson, jokes about toll prices, Occupy Wall Street, a large bank deposit and resulting "platinum" membership, a bizarre eel story, and male insecurities.  The hosts engaged in banter with Vos throughout his set.  The show ended with Tom Papa’s monologue.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently used coarse language and humor.

Here's your host, What?  Sidney Face.  Here we are again with the Worst of the Week Countdown.  My name is Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony Show and after Opie and Anthony Live.  And we are highlighting all the wonderfulness that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  On this here show, you will hear the return of Bill Burr in studio. 
[00:01:30]  Jason Statham.  Julius Irving.  That's Dr. J.  Guillermo del Toro.  All in studio.  The mess that was the Oliver Stone interview.  And by the way, the interview turned out exceptionally.  We'll get to that in a moment, plus another phone number becomes public on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Before we get to any of that, Adebisi from Oz.  He was on Lost 2.  Adewali, and I'm not even going to attempt the last name, but it's two A's. 
[00:02:00]  The AAA, Adewali, I'll attempt it.  Akanewe Agbaje.  Adewali was on the Opie and Anthony Show.  He's in Thor this weekend.  Big, big movie.  Big, big guest.  And this is a smart guy who, looking at him, I mean, I don't know how many of you saw Oz,  but Adebisi is in those eyes.  And you listen to him, and he's an intelligent man.  And he's very funny.  But at a moment's notice, he will rape you.  So be careful around him. 
[00:02:30]  That's just the impression I got, Adewali, on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Who do you play in Thor?  I play two characters.  Algrim, the strong, who transforms into Curse, this formidable beast.  Who goes to...  Curse man?  No.  He's cursed.  Curse man.  He's cursed to die.  But before he does, he takes on this formidable power, ten times that of Thor. 
[00:03:00]  So it's kind of like Holyfield and Tyson, the big bout in the cosmos.  It's the big, big throwdown.  So you, you're the, I guess, the bad guy in the movie?  I guess you would be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't hire me for my good looks, man.  That's a bad guy.  Nah, nah.  So how long did it take to, I'm going to ask the tacky question, how long did it take to film, like, the fight scene,  where, do you get the hammer out of his hand?  Are you allowed to tell?  I got it in my hotel, actually. 
[00:03:30]  So I think you won, right?  You got his hammer.  I'm still standing.  No, um, the, the fight sequences were choreographed for over a number of weeks, three, four weeks.  And, uh, we did them in Iceland in minus 30 degrees.  So no matter how much you train inside the gym or a warehouse, you go out there, it's a very different ballgame.  Yeah.  But, um, the, the prosthetic suit that I had on kept me warm and, uh, yeah, it was, it was lots of sweat. 
[00:04:00]  What a life, you in Iceland wearing a prosthetic suit fighting Thor.  You got to be thinking, like, how the hell did I get here?  I was thinking, I'm getting paid for this.  This is great.  Actually, we did have a moment like that.  We were there, like, four in the morning.  He's in his red cape and, uh, Chris and his hammer.  And I'm standing there with horns on my head.  And we just had a giggle, man.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, you just look at each other like, what the hell?  This is a job.  How is Iceland?  Cold.  It's cold?  Yeah, it's really cold.  But, but you know what?  It's one of the most spectacular places I've ever been to. 
[00:04:30]  It was the first time I realized that we actually lived on a planet.  You know, because there's fizziers coming out of the ground.  There's northern lights dancing in the sky, shooting stars falling all over the place.  It's just like, whoa.  Just so different from everything you've been used to in your whole life.  Yeah.  It was spectacular, though.  Really, real.  Big treat.  That does sound like a cold place to go.  I'm going there in December.  Are you?  For what?  I got a gig.  You got gigs?  Yeah.  Is that English?  You got one out there?  I have a, I have a, do you stand up?  I got a stand up gig over there. 
[00:05:00]  I have no idea how it's going to go over.  It's going to be hilarious if I fly all the way over there to bomb.  You know what?  Nobody's going to know.  So that's, that's one thing.  That is true.  But, but the thing is, they got this town called Reykjavik.  Yep.  And it's hot.  They, they drink a lot.  And when I say a lot, they drink a lot.  I like this.  And the women are very forthcoming.  Oh, wow.  So even if you bomb, you're going to be okay.  Do they like the accent, the American accent?  Um, do you know what?  How would he know? 
[00:05:30]  You might have an American friend.  I just think they, they know what they like.  And they come up to you and they'll tell you.  I want you.  You're coming with me.  Do they speak English over there?  Is that the, uh.  Yeah.  They, they've got their own, you know, version of it.  Language, but, you know.  Another wonderful country that actually, the majority of the people speak more than one  language.  And they also stood up to the banks.  They were like, fuck you, that's your debt.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You pay for it. 
[00:06:00]  And the bank's kind of like, oh, all right, well, you know, if you're going to, if you're  going to be able to sit down, if we could have done that, if we should have done that.  Is that easy?  That's where, uh, that's where Bobby Fischer beat, uh, Spassky for the, uh, chess championship  in summer to Reykjavik, Iceland.  And when he was, uh, at the end of his life, they gave him, uh, a home when he couldn't  come back to the U.S.  Oh, right.  Just wanted to throw a sad fact into a fun interview.  So now you're, uh, you're the bad guy.  You're, you're more powerful than, than Thor.  I am.  So he needs like Loki, I guess, to, to help him out. 
[00:06:30]  And they're not on the best of terms from like the last movie.  You got it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly.  And you know, you see, so it takes two of them.  Right, right.  That's what I'm assuming.  It takes two of them.  That's why he needs his, his little brother there or whatever.  Yeah, this is, this, uh, the dark elves is what we are known as.  It's a race of, uh, aliens who's been, whose population has been wiped out by the Asgardians,  by Thor and his people.  And so there's a point within the constellations when we can come back and reinstate ourselves 
[00:07:00]  and get some payback.  So that's really the.  How do people come up with the, how are you that creative that you come up with this constellation  and elves and stuff?  Like, did I try to write scripts?  And black elves, right?  It just comes out like an.  People opportunity elves.  We're pointing.  I got blue eyes in this one, boys.  You know, blonde hair.  You know, it's, it's a real get up.  You have blonde hair?  Yeah, blonde hair, blue eyes, pointed ears. 
[00:07:30]  It's all there.  The only one that rocks, though.  You've got to be standing as you get putting that stuff on and thinking like, this, this  movie better work.  Yeah, because I'm good.  It better work, man.  It'll sell you.  Well, you know what?  It's another one of those.  If it doesn't, nobody's going to recognize me anyway.  Oh, there you go.  No, but, um, you know, Marvel, they do those things the best, man.  It really is.  They do these movies the best.  And the way, uh, they're doing, uh, special effects these days, it just, it's so  conducive to these, uh, action, uh, movies, the Marvel movies. 
[00:08:00]  And, uh, it's, it looks great.  IMAX 3D.  IMAX 3D.  I mean, is that the real one?  The real one.  The real one.  Yeah.  Not that, not that Coors Light.  Right.  IMAX one that you get.  No, no.  That screwed me over.  No, no phonies.  We went to go see Gravity.  Uh-huh.  And I kept saying to, uh, to Nia, I kept going, well, go, well, it's IMAX, right?  It's IMAX.  And so, yeah.  And I showed up, it was bigger than the regular screen.  But IMAX is, you can't see the dude's head in front of you.  No.  And you feel like you're going to fall off the earth.  You're in the fucking room.  That's it. 
[00:08:30]  Wraps right around your head.  Right, yes.  Beats you up with the, with the sound.  I mean, it's like an orgy of experiences.  Yeah, it's all the last Star Trek and, uh, IMAX.  How many languages do you speak?  Um, just like two or three.  Yeah.  Two or three?  Yeah.  With English or what else?  A little bit of French, a little bit of Italian.  Okay.  It said, uh, our prep sheets are frequently very wrong.  It says you are fluent in several languages.  Does it say Italian?  Yoruba and Swahili.  Yeah, Yoruba is my native tongue from Nigeria.  Okay.  So I can get along with that too. 
[00:09:00]  But, uh, often what they put down there is if you say a line or two in a movie, they say  you're fluent.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I was fluent for the movie.  I was fluent for the paycheck, but, um.  Yeah.  You know.  I got a little tie to, uh, Nigeria.  I just got an email from there.  There's like 20 million bucks waiting for me.  I just got a, you know.  Oh, you got that one too?  Yeah, I just got a, send them some fucking banking information and stuff and it's all mine.  I'm really psyched.  Bill's just shaking his head. 
[00:09:30]  No, I've got that one to say.  Let me know when you get it.  I'm more shaking my head that people fall for that.  Still fall for it, right?  Well, that's their own fault though, right?  Exactly.  I mean, like, how do you be so stupid and greedy?  At this point, it really is.  Yeah.  And at this point, it's like everybody knows.  Don't they?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  At this point, it's like opening your front door and seeing a paper bag on fire.  You don't step on it because you know there's dog shit in there.  Especially with your email.  You got to get the broom.  Yeah, get the broom.  If you're going to get, it's like, dear sir, I need your help.  And your email address is fart shitter at AOL. 
[00:10:00]  Why are you contacting me with a financial officer?  This lawyer has a weird email.  No, it's like, somebody likes me.  Yeah.  I like the ones on the Facebook where there's just some unbelievably gorgeous woman will  just say, hey, I saw your picture.  And like, your male ego, you just want to believe it.  And you open it up and it always says, this account has been deleted.  You're like, oh, I thought I was looking all right.  You know?  Not again.  Who wants to be my friend? 
[00:10:30]  Dude, I'm like Charlie Brown with that shit.  I will forever try to kick the football.  I always just want to believe every single time.  It's a hard-knock life, huh?  You got to be sitting in front of a computer on Facebook looking for chicks.  It's like, the ones that pick what town you live in.  And it's like, you know, oh, Becky.  Becky is in Comac, New York right now.  No, I was getting the right words.  Clearly their second language.  And it's like, I think you great you. 
[00:11:00]  Like, she couldn't misspelt it.  It's not even a she.  It's a guy who just took the photo with some giant hairy Russian guy sending the stuff to you.  Nobody is that lucky, man.  Nobody is that lucky.  You got to know.  You're crushing my dream.  You're always hoping it, though, and be like, what is the last?  Yeah, you got to have some hope.  It's funny.  You got to.  Even if it's coming from Bulgaria.  We were talking about, before you came in, like, you're one of the rare people that have been on two TV shows that made it to syndication. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yes, yes, yes.  And if you get to the third one, then you get into, like, we're talking, like, Lee Majors has done three.  Three.  Shatner.  Shatner's done three.  And I think Heather Locklear's the king with, I think she's done four.  Man, that's a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Four made it to syndication.  So you're right there.  Yeah, you got one.  I'm on my way.  You're like the New York football giants with, like, four Super Bowls. 
[00:12:00]  You get that fifth one, you're a dynasty.  Yeah.  I'm getting some checks.  This is good to know.  He's getting checks.  Uh-huh.  Damn.  Did you practice law at all or just graduate?  No.  I graduated and I ran as fast as I could from it, you know.  But, yeah, seven years was enough.  Did you ever take the bar or no?  No.  No.  Just did a bachelor's and a master's degree in law.  And that's in London.  That's it.  And then you dominated.  Casual bar.  That was in London, yeah.  Oh, I needed it.  I just became a movie star. 
[00:12:30]  What do you have your sights fixed on next?  Flying the next space shuttle?  Let's do that movie.  Yeah.  A bit of directing.  A bit of this.  You can't go to Mars.  They're doing a Thor movie again.  So.  Shoot the next thing in the North Pole.  Figured we'd go up there and go do that.  No, no.  It was.  It's been a great foundation, though, because it's what's helped me stay focused and disciplined.  Because you can come in this industry all hippified, you know.  Oh, it's artsy.  But, you know, the law, you know, you train your brain and you approach it the same way as you would a case. 
[00:13:00]  You know, you analyze, you focus, you know, stats, everything.  So, yeah, it must be convenient to not have people be able to, you know, mumbo-jumbo you with a contract talk bullshit.  Oh, man, you have no idea.  You know, I have a lot of active friends that are always asking, especially when I first got in.  They were calling me up for a lot of advice, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  To go over the advice that their own attorney.  It would be embarrassing if I had to ask you for advice, because I'm so not well-read with that stuff that I can't even intelligently convey what the problem is. 
[00:13:30]  I mean, I'm getting here, like, two paragraphs in.  What is this shit about?  It's all mumbo-jumbo.  You can break through it.  But, you know, what's funny is, like, obviously you studied lore and then you, you know, you blow up by playing the most, you know, notorious comic in the prison, you know, in New York.  But those aren't the best roles.  It is.  You don't want to be the good guy. 
[00:14:00]  Come on, knock it off.  You were so evil in Oz, man.  It was just whenever you were on screen.  Yeah, it was.  Because whenever you were on screen, you're just like, oh, shit.  It almost felt like you were in the joint, like, you would want to avoid Arabisi in prison.  Arabisi.  Arabisi.  At any cost.  And then, like, you'd be watching at home and he'd come on screen and you'd be like, oh, shit, don't look.  Don't look at him.  Don't make eye contact.  Yeah, I mean, they should have a poster of him in the schools. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Just like, you know.  Have to be a deterrent.  Yeah, you know, do your homework.  That show has done so well, I, forget about avoiding his character, I avoided the series.  I was just like, dude, this is just too real.  It's too much.  I mean, I almost would rather watch the documentaries of prison weren't as bad because they alluded  to what happened.  Like, pause.  Yeah, they edited it.  They showed it.  It was just.  People shitting on each other.  The branding that would go on.  Yeah.  Didn't get that far into it. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, it was a nightmare.  I saw one rape and I was like, all right, that's how I thought it would go down.  You know, it was funny just yesterday.  I'm all good.  Just yesterday, this guy, he works just outside the building where I live and every time I  go by, he's always trying to, you know, pull me in, but I'm always going to work.  And Jesse got me, he said, I just want to tell you I'm such a big fan.  And, you know, and, and my, my favorite scene, he started to go into what his favorite scene  was when, when I had Kenny Wanger on, on the bed and I'm just looking, it's like eight 
[00:15:30]  o'clock in the morning.  This guy's like 50.  I'm like, that's too much information.  I'm like, I'm glad that you like this.  He's going into all the details.  That's what you got to do.  The cell phone trick.  Hey, I got to, I got to just keep walking.  When you rape somebody in a scene, do you get the condiment craft services that day?  You know, it's, it's, those are, those are tough, man.  Oh, man.  I mean, personally, I could never be on the other end. 
[00:16:00]  Right, right, yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  I just couldn't.  And it was a very, very traumatic scene for the actor.  It was, right?  It really was.  I mean, you know, it shook him up.  Damn.  You know, there were tears because, because it's a violation.  Whether you're doing it or simulating it, it's like, ain't nobody want to do that and  then not be seen to be doing that.  A hundred million.  So, you know, I applaud him because he's a great actor, but it's, it's hard, man.  I heard, I heard there was, there was a rumor that said, if you pissed off the writers 
[00:16:30]  on that show, that they wrote a rape scene for you.  No, no, that was Mary Callen Moore.  That's, that's what I heard.  I'm not, I'm not saying that, I'm just saying, like, I don't know how this stuff starts.  Oh, that's true.  It is true?  Yeah.  Like, you know, you, you get axed.  Wow.  You get axed, raped, killed, shanked, whatever.  Damn.  And that was good.  That was the good times.  Because you show up for work and you do your job.  Otherwise, you were dead or raped or whatever. 
[00:17:00]  Fuck.  I didn't realize it affected the actors after it was all done, though.  Say again?  I didn't realize it affected the actors, though, after they moved on from that.  Yeah.  I mean, it does.  I mean, it depends what you're doing, but, you know, I mean, look, there were guys who  were not homosexual, but they would come in and, you know, they're putting tongues down  each other's throat.  I mean, you know, then you're going to go home and kiss the wife and the kids.  I mean, of course, you know, it's going to shake you up, man. 
[00:17:30]  Especially when you realize you're still thinking about work.  Well, you got to go back to work and do it the next day, you know.  Why does it now have to be tongues down the throat?  Well, I mean, that was that particular scenario.  They used to just fake that a little bit.  They would turn their heads to us or play.  Love scenes, even love scenes.  Right.  The whole thing is completely unnecessary.  If you watch, like, old school movies, if they were going to show two people they were  intimate, they would go in the bedroom and they closed the door.  You know what happened.  You know, watch them like that.  Right, right.  They're just banging each other.  For some reason, they... 
[00:18:00]  It needs to be broken down.  Yeah, they need to show it now.  I don't...  Well, they have to show how passionate it is.  Oh, my God.  Look how good they fuck.  Don't you hate them?  For one of the better words.  What a connection.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I hate those clothes tearing off scenes.  I fucking hate sex scenes.  It's angry.  Ah!  Ah!  Nobody fucks like that.  Oh, really?  That's it?  No! 
[00:18:30]  How is this guy from, man?  Oh, God.  Just tweak my nipples.  I'm losing my erection.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  I'm losing it.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  Yes, yes.  It's the worst of the week countdown.  I am Sam Roberts from O&A and after Opie and Anthony Live.  My show is on this Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern.  That's the Sam Roberts show.  This week, big interview show.  DDP, Diamond Dallas Page, wrestler.  He's going to be talking about DDP yoga and saving Scott Hall and Jake the Snake Roberts' lives. 
[00:19:00]  Michelle Trachtenberg, who's just a hot chick.  Is going to be on the show.  She was also a guest.  Not a guest.  A judge.  When I was on the show, figure it out as a kid.  So that's going to be exciting.  And Zachary Levi, formerly of the show.  Chuck.  All on the Sam Roberts show Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern.  Still to come on this here countdown today.  In this moment.  Bill Burr in studio.  Dr. J in studio.  Another phone number.  Gets made public on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:19:30]  A Colin Quinn appearance.  Oliver Stone.  Well, that one gets complicated.  But before we get to any of that.  Jason Statham.  He's now a friend of the show.  He's an action hero.  And there's not too many people in Hollywood right now.  That are more badass than this guy.  And not, you know, in their upper to mid-60s.  Jason Statham is keeping action alive.  And he stopped by the Opie and Anthony show.  To talk about his latest movie.  Check it out.  Number six. 
[00:20:00]  Jason's in a home front.  Looks pretty badass, actually.  Did I get a DVD or anything?  No, I've seen Trello, though.  Yeah.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  You look like you're fighting a meth kingpin.  That's right.  At this time.  Yeah.  At this one.  Now you're kicking his ass.  He gets a share, yeah.  And it's like you've got to protect your family.  Family's first. 
[00:20:30]  Right, right.  You know what?  It's always tough.  You play those video games where you've got to kind of protect someone else in the video game.  It's the biggest pain in the ass.  Like, I like just barreling in, shooting and stuff.  Now you've got to protect somebody.  And that's not normally you.  Well, it is.  You're normally one person or something.  Maybe in the trunk of the car you've got to protect.  It's very distracting.  For the most part, yeah.  You're taking care of yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's better.  The selfish way.  Right.  The selfish way.  But now you've got, like, you know, the family. 
[00:21:00]  Big pain in the ass.  Proper.  Yeah.  It's too much time.  Yeah, yeah.  Run and gun.  I like the run and gun.  I want to see you come in one time and promote a movie about a guy who opens a greenhouse  and develops a love with the flowers.  And a gentleman friend comes in and they become roommates.  Oh, my God.  That would be great.  Every day I come in with a hose.  Just sprinkle it.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  And it's a combination.  Irrigation.  Irrigator. 
[00:21:30]  How the flowers are growing.  Do you ever have a, do you ever have the urge to kind of break out and do a role that's  completely not you?  Something like that.  No.  Not you, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Something like the old leading man rom-com thing?  Oh, I'd look such an idiot trying that way.  Do you think?  Yeah.  I mean, I mean, like I said, I don't really, you know, I don't have any sort of traditional  experience in acting.  Right, right.  I'm just winging it anyway.  I mean, so to try and do something ways away from, you know, what I'm doing right now 
[00:22:00]  might be a bit of a huge mistake.  Like, you complete me, you twat.  He downplays his acting every time he's in here.  I think at this point, I think you're a good actor.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't fake it this long.  Yeah, well, I probably can.  Living proof.  Right.  Me old chap.  No, because it is kind of a subdued thing until you start kicking ass. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, I mean, this is a good, it's a great script.  You know, this was written by Sylvester Stallone.  Oh, right, yeah.  For himself.  It was going to be the last installment of Rambo.  No kidding.  Jeez.  And he wrote it in 208, and it's an adaptation of a book written by Chuck Logan.  And he just thought it was going to be great for him to be the last chapter of Rambo.  But, you know, things changed.  We started to write The Expendables.  He did another Rocky instead.  Right.  So a lot of things got in the way of him doing this movie, so it was there on the shelf 
[00:23:00]  gathering dust, and it was a really great script.  So when we were shooting Expendables 2, he said, I've got this little thing that, you  know, I was going to do, I'd like to read it, and, you know, it's like the greatest  compliment you can get, you know, to have a script written for himself, you know, handed  to me.  So it was like, and then after I read it, it was great, and just begged him and begged  him and then got a gun and said, please let me do it.  But I love how he could just go, ah, you do this one. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, I'm not going to.  Ah, you do this one.  I know it's going to be great, but I don't feel like doing it.  Does everybody who knew Rambo go like, your accent, you sound different.  Why are you so skinny?  You don't sound the same anymore.  Yeah.  Obviously, there was a fucking rewrite.  Oh, okay.  But Sylvester's still uncool or what?  Yeah, he is.  He is, right?  We had him on once, and we really liked him.  Oh, he's so funny.  He's just, he's a real, he's a unique chap. 
[00:24:00]  He's just so, he's so talented, and he's just a real person, you know?  He's had a lot of experience, so he's got some killer stories.  But, you know, he really cares about what he does, and he, you know, it shows.  People really like him.  I think there was a little rift on the Expendables between him and Bruce Willis.  Something was going on.  Right, I'm not sure what that was.  I was just, I wasn't going to say anything.  I was going to be like, look, you don't have to say anything.  Let's see how he handles this. 
[00:24:30]  I was like, let me see how he handles this.  Let's see how he handles this.  He handles this like a diplomatic actor that doesn't want to lose any work.  I've heard nothing about that.  All right, the microphones are off, please.  Now tell us.  Wow, you're a politician.  That's smart, though.  That is very smart.  We can learn from you.  What am I supposed to do?  Tell the real truth.  Exactly.  Were you surprised that Bruce was making a million dollars a day?  Because they said that's what it was.  What?  He wanted to make a million dollars a day, I think.  Or he wanted, it was like, he was getting a million for four days. 
[00:25:00]  And he wanted to make a million a day.  So he either wanted four million or three days.  That's OP money.  Wow.  Yeah.  What?  Really?  Wow.  What happened?  Keep you stocked up in baked beans for quite a while.  That's it, right?  It certainly would.  Yeah, but he doesn't know.  Yeah.  He wasn't around that day.  I wasn't around that day.  No one talked about it.  I was watching the football.  Right.  See?  Jason shows up for the job, does it to the best of his ability, keep the drama away, and 
[00:25:30]  keep working.  Right.  You don't want to badmouth people like Bruce Willis or, you know, spill the beans there  on what Sly is thinking.  When are we going to learn?  I know.  We're the worst at us.  Although Kevin Smith was pretty honest about Bruce Willis when he worked with him.  Yeah.  See, and that has nothing to do with Jason Statham.  Well, it's that he's a big pain in the ass, is basically what he's saying.  He's a pain in the ass to work with.  Right.  And, you know, when he's on set, he's on set.  Right.  And screw everybody else.  See, I didn't find that.  My experience with him was very good. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, you did actually.  Jimmy did a scene with Bruce Willis.  Bruce Willis.  Yeah, it was very good.  I felt that he was very nurturing and nice.  Did you?  Yeah, he was good.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Still like those die-hard movies.  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  They're great films.  And the first one is just one of the classic, definitive genre movies.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's the movie.  So great.  Great villain.  Do you watch action films when you're not filming them?  When I'm filming them.  No, when you're not.  Or do you want to, like, kind of get away from that whole genre?  I don't know.  I mean, a lot of them are crap. 
[00:26:30]  So, I mean, it's hard to get a good one unless you have to have the right people in it, I think.  Right.  But, I mean, a lot of the time they're a little bit thin on story and a little bit, you know, predictable.  But they're good popcorn films.  So, it depends what it is.  I mean, I'll watch every one of the die-hards.  I think, like you said a minute ago, they're great.  Yeah.  I do like a good action film.  But it depends what's out of the time when you're making films.  You know, nowadays, you just have to look and see what's on the old iTunes. 
[00:27:00]  I like the Mission Impossibles.  I thought those were well done.  Very good.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Do you get pulled over driving and have people be like, oh, Christ, it's this guy.  Because I can only imagine a cop pulling over and going, oh, of course.  I can't give him a ticket.  He proves he can drive real well.  Sir, you were doing 475 in a school zone?  Yeah.  Are you civil on the road?  Yeah, you know what? 
[00:27:30]  I'm very civil on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I used to be a little bit more reckless when I was  a lot younger.  Yeah, yeah.  We used to race from, I used to live in North London.  And we used to have a pool that we used to train at when I was back in the day doing a bit  of high diving.  And we used to drive from North London to South East London.  And we used to race through the city as quick as we could.  We used to race every week.  We used to have these crappy little GTIs. 
[00:28:00]  You know, these two-door hatchbacks.  Yeah, tiny little things.  Wow.  My friend had a Gordini Turbo, a little Renault.  Yeah, we were just idiots with the music on, trying to, you know, beat each other down  to the other pool.  Yeah, and you never got pulled over and thrown in the clink?  No, but not really.  Not in the city.  It's hard because, you know, there's not any sort of, if you're going through a congested  city, it's a lot less likely you're going to get pulled with a, you know, a guy with  a, you know, a speed sort of a speed gun. 
[00:28:30]  What's the fastest you've gone?  Have you ever clocked yourself?  What's your number?  It's got a number.  What's your number at?  It's like 160.  You did want that.  I thought 160.  Yeah, that's.  Yeah, I borrowed a Lamborghini for the weekend.  Yeah, me thought we'd wring its neck.  Have you gone faster than 160 on regular roads?  I'm not talking on a track or anything, by the way, just on the regular roads.  No, on the regular roads.  No, that's crazy.  No, that was on a track.  I never did 160 on a regular road.  Yeah, that's what I mean on a regular road.  Oh, you're probably 120, 130. 
[00:29:00]  That's still fucking impressive.  Yeah, I grab a car, I do double nickels.  Double nickels.  The whole way.  That's right.  10 o'clock, 2 o'clock.  You get over to Germany, you can really put your foot down.  Yeah, yeah.  On the autobine.  Have you done it?  The autobine?  You know what?  I've never been on the autobine.  I would have loved to have done that.  Because people say it's just insane.  Yeah.  It's an insane experience.  Flat out experience, yeah.  I saw a special on that, and they have all kinds of signals set up for people, because  you're going so fast, you have to know what's up ahead very early on. 
[00:29:30]  So they've got these warning lights and signs that tell you that there might be traffic  up ahead, like five miles ahead.  Why?  And a truck might be stopped.  Why do they allow that?  Because they're awesome.  Not to be the party pooper here, but they're awesome over there.  It sounds like it's crazy.  Are there a lot of terrible accidents, like 300 car pileups on the autobahn?  What a shitty road that is.  I don't want anarchy on a highway.  I want to be the only one that gets to go fast.  Not everyone else.  When I was working in Miami, I was doing a film called Transporter 2. 
[00:30:00]  And we had this Lamborghini Roadster, an LP640, it was at the time, it hadn't been released.  And we basically had the cops close off, what was it, sort of three or four miles on this  built-up area in a 30 mile an hour limit zone.  Wow.  And they just, like all the intersections, they just closed them off with the cars.  And we did this rip-roaring sort of one take down through this built-up area.  And I think at the time, Pierre Morel, who was actually the guy that directed Taken at the time, 
[00:30:30]  he was just the cameraman.  And he was in the passenger seat, and it was me driving.  And I think we hit about a ton 30 in a 30 mile an hour limit zone.  It was, we was flying.  It was a great thrill.  Because you get the sensation of the trees and everything flying by.  It's very close to you.  At least everything's closed off to us here.  Don't have to worry about someone zipping through the intersection. 
[00:31:00]  Just hoping all those guys are paying attention.  The ones closing off the roads.  Yeah.  Do you see a ton 30?  Yeah.  Oh, I never heard that before.  A hundred and thirty.  Oh, yeah.  I just never heard a ton 30.  That's kind of cool.  I like that.  Why don't you start using it with your accent, Jimmy?  Ton 30?  Jimmy has an accent that comes out every once in a while.  Especially if Ozzy's here.  When Ozzy's here, he goes into a little thing.  Fantastic.  Who's in the movie with you?  I see...  James Franco. 
[00:31:30]  Right, right.  James Franco's the bad guy.  He's the bad guy.  He plays like...  He's like a meth sort of kingpin.  Uh-huh.  He's like this drug lord that...  Basically, I'm in this small sort of hillbilly sort of time.  Like, it's supposed to be this picturesque sort of area where I'm taking my daughter to live for this, you know, riding horses.  Right.  It's always the way.  Yeah, and behind this beauty lurks this, you know, nasty sort of sinister crap that's going on with drugs. 
[00:32:00]  But why do you have to get involved?  Yeah, I was just going to say, why can't you just let him do his thing?  And you ride your horses with your daughter.  Why do you guys always got to get involved?  Well, what happens is, like, that my little daughter gets pushed around by the school bully.  Uh-oh.  And, you know, he's a bit of a big chap.  And she, obviously, being my daughter, has been taught a few things.  She knows how to take care of herself.  She knows how to handle herself.  Yeah.  So she takes care of him in the necessary way. 
[00:32:30]  And then it starts a little bit of a feud from the dad, the parents.  And then it all gets a little bit out of hand.  And they start pushing around her.  Uh-huh.  Now it makes sense.  Wow.  Of course.  Just say, look, I'm sorry my daughter kicked your son's ass.  Right.  Let's go have a few beers and talk this over.  Just want to ride horses and be nice.  No need to get the meth kingpin involved.  Exactly.  No need for us to be shooting at each other over a schoolyard tussle.  Right. 
[00:33:00]  Like, cooler heads prevail.  Exactly.  And Winona Ryder's in there.  Winona Ryder's in it.  Yeah.  She's great.  Kate Bosworth does a terrific job.  She does a brilliant performance.  She plays this tweaker.  Oh, she's all fucked up.  Yeah, she's all fucked up.  Does that mean she's zooted?  Zooted.  Is that it?  She is high.  Zooted.  She's on the mollies.  Yeah, yeah.  She's on the meth.  Right.  Who else is in it?  A really great little girl called Isabella, who just blew everybody away with a great audition. 
[00:33:30]  Clancy Brown's in it.  Clancy Brown.  Did you ever see the Highlander?  Oh, yeah.  He played the Kurgan.  He was there.  Oh, man.  I can see that.  He's great.  Long-ass time.  Oh, man.  Who is he?  Does Franco, James Franco, have a minion, henchman kind of people?  Yes, he's got a couple, yeah.  Kind of a few, kind of disposable guys.  They get, yeah.  He has got a couple of people that, you know, flex the muscle for him.  Fly your fist into their faces and whatnot. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Gotcha.  I like Jason.  I think this is going to end badly for James Franco.  Oh, probably.  I think.  I think this could be a problem in the end for him.  I bet at the end, James Franco feels guilty and goes to rehab and gets his life together.  And then Jason kills the horses and sells them for glue, because he now is addicted to meth.  What a horrible movie you're going to drive, Jimmy.  How great would that be?  Just twist the whole fucking thing.  It's like, what the fuck is it right? 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, you see the car driving away with, like, happy music playing and a horse horse being thrown out the window for no reason.  An awful ending.  Yeah, just some barbaric, terrible ending.  This sounds great, man.  I love Jason's movies.  They're just so much fun, action-packed, and I love the weaponry and whatnot.  We get a little gunplay in this?  It is a little gunplay, yeah.  A little gunplay?  A bit of an old shotgun.  I like that, right?  Yeah.  Maybe some knife play? 
[00:35:00]  A little knife play?  There is no knife play in this one, no.  I like a little knife play.  I improvise with someone who gets whacked around the head with a car battery.  All right.  Okay, there you go.  That's the kind of stuff.  Oh, that would hurt.  You need that one.  What about the nipple play, though?  I like some good nipple play.  Jimmy enjoys a little nipple play.  I do.  I really creep people out when I say I like nip play.  When you abbreviate nipple, that really disturbs people.  No one wants.  Speaking of tweaking.  But it's funny.  You're always looking for the right prop to hit someone with, as it has been used before. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We had, what's his name, Guillermo del Toro on the other day.  What an interesting fellow, man.  And he directed Pacific Rim.  And I thought it was great.  I was like, it was one of those old school kind of monster movie feel to it.  And at one point when the robot guy's just going through the street trying to get the monster,  and he's dragging a ship behind him.  He's just dragging a ship, and he picks it up like a bat and hits the monster. 
[00:36:00]  It's like, he's beating.  They wrote in where this guy beats another guy with a ship.  That's fucking awesome.  That's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  So a car battery is a great weapon.  Doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?  Really?  You just downplayed his fucking battery.  You're not quite as tall as the robots.  Thanks for ruining my get.  I took away your thunder.  This is a good get.  No, you've got to bring some different stuff.  You've got to have a bag with weird shit in it.  Like a fight breaks out, you pull out a slide whistle and a dildo,  and you can plug somebody with it. 
[00:36:30]  That would still be great to watch somebody being struck.  I would actually like watching that, sure.  What's the next movie?  What's the next movie?  I'm right in the middle of shooting Fast and the Furious Part 7.  I just recently finished Expendables 3 with Sly,  and they've got a good cast this time.  Who's different in the cast?  They've got Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Wesley Snipes. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, wow.  It's funny because we break Wesley out of prison.  At the beginning of the movie, a couple of the lads were in the plane,  and they go, so why were you in prison?  He says, tax evasion.  It was quite funny.  That's awesome.  Yeah, they put it in a film.  And, of course, Bruce Willis.  Oh, that's right.  He's not in this one.  I don't think.  What else they got?  Wesley Snipes.  He's so good.  I love it.  He's so good.  Gerard Depardieu. 
[00:37:30]  He's like a really weird addition to this.  Have you ever seen anyone do an impression of you?  No.  My friend does it.  You know, Godfrey, the black comic.  He does it.  He's a great mimic, and he does an amazing Jason Statham.  Wow, I've never seen him do that.  No one does Jason Statham but him.  I was wondering if you knew anybody who did it.  We should have him on the phone to do it.  It doesn't necessarily help the conversation, but I just figured I'd mention it.  It's all ahead of time.  We could have him on the phone.  He does it.  Jason's like, wow, that's pretty good. 
[00:38:00]  Or Jason criticizes it.  Right.  It's awful.  He never does it again.  Yeah.  He never performs again because he's degraded.  Yeah.  What do you mean he has to go?  I think we covered it, though.  I think we did pretty good here.  Fast cars.  Where are you going?  Car battery.  Car battery fight.  Fucking nipple play.  Good actors.  Nipple play.  Nipple play.  Got the dirt on Bruce Willis.  I think we did good here today.  He spoke volumes with his silence. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, God.  Okay.  So, home front.  That's fantastic, man.  I love this.  Phil Broker.  Phil Broker.  That's you.  I'm Phil Broker.  Low-level DEA agent.  You're going to be kicking some ass in this one.  There's a great sly line.  What does he say?  He goes, whatever you're thinking, rethink it.  You know what?  No one can deliver that better than sly, but, you know, I tried.  You could have your best shot.  I'm sure it's...  It's probably slow and methodically probably like you did, you know, whatever you think. 
[00:39:00]  I can't do a line like that.  I would, yeah, I can imagine him doing that.  I would say, whatever you're thinking, me think it.  That's good delivery there.  Menacing, huh?  I'm not buying into the whole winging it thing anymore.  The winging it.  You keep saying you wing it as an actor to a certain degree.  I don't buy that anymore.  You have too many hits under your belt.  It says, I'm still winging it now to a certain degree.  I'm not the sort of actor who spent hours in drama school or with an acting teacher or anything like that. 
[00:39:30]  You're not winging it anymore.  You're damn good.  Well, I mean, it's...  You're damn good, sir.  You just, you know, you just get in there and you just, you know...  Wing it.  Wing it.  Yeah, let's have it right.  Wing it.  Turn up, say these fucking words.  That's about as good as it is.  You know, it is.  You know, because I...  It's funny.  It takes me back to meeting Guy Ritchie.  And I had no experience again at that time.  And he was making this film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. 
[00:40:00]  I love that one.  And he says, listen, I did the audition and I pleased all the, you know, the sceptical producers  and the, you know, the casting directors that wanted all these thespians from fucking RADA.  And so all these people that didn't want me, Guy was the one who fought for me.  And I said, okay, Guy, you give me the part.  Thanks very much.  So obviously I better start learning how to act.  So shall I go and get a few lessons?  He went, no, you silly prat. 
[00:40:30]  Just turn up and say the fucking words.  Turn up and say the words.  That was it.  Fucking words.  You don't need any.  That stuff's no good to you.  You just...  Because you don't want to be too polished.  You'll probably overthink it, right?  Through every actor that...  That was probably appropriate for his movie.  And I just applied that same technique to everything I've ever done, which is probably  not the smartest thing.  That's why Jason's not playing Macbeth.  Correct.

It's crazy when you think about the old-timers and the amount of money that they should have made.  Dr. J, you always want to talk to a legend.  And you always want to hear it again when it's replayed on the worst of the week countdown. 
[00:46:30]  Number five.  It was very sad, the part where you talk about, I mean, there's been a lot of deaths that you've dealt with.  But, you know, I wasn't going to mention it, but you just mentioned your brothers.  It was really, really sad to read that because the way you, you know, it's like I didn't know him.  But you build up these people from, you know, the stories in the book and you kind of, you get somewhat attached to them.  And then you read a chapter and you're like, no, no, no, all right, he's all right.  And then the next chapter, it's like, ugh.  But it really was a really well-written, sad moment. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, the rollercoaster ride of, you know, the highs associated with sports success, academic success.  And, you know, I guess success in terms of personal relationships and non-successes.  But, you know, what the public pretty much knows about mostly is, you know, what's reported in terms of, you know, rise and fall of a sports person. 
[00:47:30]  You know, you win or you lose.  You win or you lose, come back, you try again the next year.  So there's a 16-year window in which I was a professional athlete.  But at age 63, you know, now you've got 47 years of accountability and less before than after.  So there's been more, you know, since I walked off the court.  And that's what I wanted to share.  You mentioned your age, 63. 
[00:48:00]  I hear there's a video of you dunking at 63.  Is that true?  Yeah, yeah, I can throw it down.  You know, it rattles a little bit.  But who cares?  As long as it stays in.  You're still dunking.  Actually, the day when I dunked, we were working on the documentary.  And it was in February.  And I went and I sat for about four hours, you know, being filmed on camera, talking about stuff. 
[00:48:30]  And they said, well, can you dunk a few?  Right.  So I was like, okay.  We've been sitting here.  Been sitting here.  So, you know, lace them up, put on, you know, the shorts and the whole deal, which, you know, you guys have on there right there in front of me right now.  Oh, okay.  It did rattle a little bit.  We've got to call that a rubbing.  But that was after sitting for four hours.  And then I go over and I stretch on the bench.  Right.  You know, it's like, you know, you try to stretch for about five or six minutes.  Uh-huh. 
[00:49:00]  And then, you know, I go in there and I miss.  And then I go in and I make it.  And I said, is that enough?  Right.  Because, you know, you don't want to get hurt.  No.  Do your knees and groins still bother you or is that kind of fun?  Actually, I found this training method.  Can I shamelessly endorse it here?  It's the next big thing.  It's called Fit Wall.  And it's booming in San Diego and, you know, Southern California right now.  So it's moving east.  But I got two in my basement. 
[00:49:30]  So I go there and I get a cardio workout.  I get a flexibility workout.  And I get a strength workout.  Fit Wall.  And it's head to toe.  It's head to toe.  Fit Wall.  You heard it here.  Yes.  Swimwalking is a big one.  Yeah.  And Dr. J obviously made the slam dunk.  Like, you know, popular.  People really weren't dunking before you for whatever reason.  Or it wasn't impressive when they did it.  I always saw Chamberlain and Duncan and Russell, you know, just going and getting over the rim and kind of laying it down. 
[00:50:00]  But nobody rearing back.  Tom Hawkins.  Now, Connie Hawkins was doing that.  You know, he was there.  He'd go down the lane.  And then I remember he had one of the greatest quotes ever because he said,  they either got to lower the rim or raise the floor because the hawk can't soar no more.  And I said, I'm going to have that day happen to me at some point because, you know, once a year, what are you going to do?  The way you describe the dunking was amazing, too. 
[00:50:30]  Like, when you're going from the foul line or however many feet, it's the things you saw.  Like, you're like, and I noticed that he jumped, but his hand was coming back down, which meant that he was coming.  Like, you saw so much in that split second that you're up in the air and make a lot of decisions.  It's not just jump up and throw the ball in.  Yeah, there's a consciousness.  And, you know, when you're in the air, literally it's only a split second.  Right.  But it could seem like more, you know, if you move the ball from left hand to right hand or, you know, the way they do it now, 
[00:51:00]  the guys go behind their backs and go under the legs.  They do a whole lot of freaky stuff that we didn't do.  But because I could palm the ball and Connie Hawkins could palm the ball and some other guys, you know,  we would maneuver it around and make it very difficult for shot blockers.  But I used to always think, you know, it was an attack in the basket.  Just look for daylight. 
[00:51:30]  And if there was a head or a shoulder or a hand, there's no daylight there.  So you go where that's not.  Right.  And have fun with it.  And some famous, famous Dr. J shots where he's just twisting and turning in the air.  It's just amazing.  The one thing I learned about reading your book was that you kind of, I always just thought you were Dr. J your entire basketball career.  But you came out of nowhere.  You almost didn't make it into the pros.  Right?  It's funny you should say that.  I did not realize that. 
[00:52:00]  I thought you were like a superstar and everyone knew about you from a very early age.  But that's not the truth here.  There's so many assumptions, right?  And I really came in the side door and caught a lot of people by surprise.  That amazes me.  And one of the things was, I guess, with UMass getting snubbed two years in which we won our conference.  Well, we didn't have automatic bids to the NCAA tournament.  And that was the bigger tournament, 32 teams.  And it was 16 to the NIT.  But we won our conference.  We got recognized by the NIT. 
[00:52:30]  Then we got eliminated in the first round, both years to the eventual champions,  which were Marquette and North Carolina.  And so it was easy to be overlooked.  And even after my sophomore year, in which I was one of the nation's leading scorers and second in the nation in rebounding,  they said, well, we want to get all the young players together in Colorado and get ready for the Olympics.  So I was snubbed in as well. 
[00:53:00]  And my coach, Jack Lehman, who's no longer with us, he pushed hard, got me on the alternates list.  A couple guys got hurt.  So I go out as an alternate.  And now I end up being the leading scorer and rebounder in the camp.  And, you know, go on a nice tour of Russia, Poland, and Finland at age 20.  Lead the team in scoring and rebounding.  Didn't you say Russia was a real dump where you were in Poland?  Well, the costs were very inferior, you know, as well as the food.  I'm sure it's changed now. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, but back then it kind of sucked.  But Finland was pretty cool.  You know, it was bright and never got dark.  And, you know, it was a new experience for a bunch of young guys going over there and hanging out.  But after Russia and Poland, man, it was so good to get back to it.  You know, it was the proverbial, I got to kiss the sidewalk when I get home.  Yeah, yeah.  But even though you were a great player, you were being overlooked.  And then, you know, a little luck there.  Or we wouldn't know you as Dr. J.  Yeah.  You know, I was a doctor in high school and through college. 
[00:54:00]  Me and my best buddy, you know, we coined nicknames.  But it became Dr. J in Virginia.  And, you know, with Bob Travolini, who was the trainer, he came up with Dr. J.  Because they used to call the one of the other trainers was Doc.  And then they had the physician, team physician.  He was Doc.  So I couldn't just be Doc.  So I had to be Dr. J.  And they started promoting Charlie, the great Scott and Julius, Dr. J. 
[00:54:30]  Irving and Virginia Squires coming to town.  Watch out for these guys.  Right.  ABA.  How long did you list for?  Before I forget, you list.  Oh, that was in my elementary school days.  I list too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll tell you, you know, a large percentage of people in the world.  And I have a 12-year-old son. 
[00:55:00]  And, you know, he did it between ages five and eight.  Yeah.  But just go away.  Went away.  Now you can't shut him up.  Can't shut you up either.  No, no.  I like to chat.  But don't you hate an adult lisper?  I think now we can get that cleared up.  Because you and I both list as children.  And we've overcome it.  And I think that we can agree that adult lispers are truly enraging.  You know, you have to address it.  Yeah.  It's like, how about you put your teeth together and make that sound?  I did that when I was seven.  I learned it.  You did?  Yeah.  So did Dr. J.  You say, diss and that? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  It's silly.  When I see an adult doing that, oh, come on.  It's so stupid.  I just want to mash their tongue between their teeth and sever it.  Teach them to talk properly.  The other thing that amazed me in the book was, and I was a huge fan of yours, you lead  basketball in 87, and you only have, I say only just because of what they're making  nowadays.  You only had $9 million.  That amazes me.  So you didn't really get a taste of the really, really big salaries, right?  No.  And I think there were guys who never made an all-star team who got the $9 million very 
[00:56:00]  quick in the 90s.  Yes.  Like, I mean, only a few years later, like, you missed it by two or three years where they  were really making the monster contracts.  Yeah.  We thank David Stern for that.  And obviously, the players like myself and Kareem and others who were, you know, the foundation  for that platform, and Michael, of course, with the endorsements and the globalization of  the sport, you know, it all happened very quickly. 
[00:56:30]  And, you know, I hate to say it, we missed the boat because, you know, there are things  that influence your life, and obviously, economics are one of those things.  So in terms of working hard and supporting your family and taking on new challenges and  finding ways to get it done afterwards, you know what I mean?  If I quit basketball in 1987 and I said, well, I'm set for the rest of my life, I don't think 
[00:57:00]  I would be the individual that I am today.  Yeah, yeah.  So by not being, so by being very conscious of not being set for my life, you know, work  ethic was still there and taking on new challenges and trying different things.  I mean, I became a Coca-Cola bottler for one thing, and, you know, went on some public company  and private company boards, and just began to expand my business horizon.  And through good fortune, you know, I've been able to almost get there, where a lot of 
[00:57:30]  things are taken care of.  I can't say, you know, we're taken care of for the rest of our lives, because, you know,  I think the more you make, the more you spend.  But you lost, my follow-up is you lost a lot of the money.  You know, you had the $9 million and then a few bad investments, then it really kind of  dropped you down a bit for a while, huh?  Well, you know, I don't think you should get locked in on that number.  I mean, I've had a net worth of 20-plus.  There you go. 
[00:58:00]  So, you know, so I've been there and had setbacks, climbed back, and, you know, it's a rollercoaster  ride just like life.  Right, right, right.  Did you really give away between $6 million and $10 million to people who are coming to  you for help or whatever?  Absolutely.  Wow.  Absolutely.  With no form of repayment or no desire to get paid back, or were there a lot of loans  that just never...  They said it was no desire to get paid back.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  There's a thing...  I didn't say that.  The desire is there.  There's a thing, when you make a lot of money, I've handed out a lot of money, and there's 
[00:58:30]  always this, I don't know, understanding on their part that you're, oh, you have so much  money, of course you don't want it back.  So there's not even a thought of, look, I'll try to pay you back someday.  Yeah, the problem is when you guys are walking down the street and they cross the street to  avoid you.  Oh, man.  That becomes a problem, because there'll be a lot of friendships that have been lost  over, you know, loans and... 
[00:59:00]  What's the biggest hunk someone had the balls to ask for?  Not that you gave it to them, but what's the biggest hunk that you were like, you son  of a bitch just asked me for this much, that they didn't have the right to ask for?  Six figures.  It should be over $100,000?  Wow.  I had someone in my family do the exact same thing, and then they couldn't understand why  I didn't come up with it.  I'm like, I don't know how much money you think I have, but I can't just throw $100,000 at  you.  And it wasn't a brother or sister, just to make that clear, but someone that was in dire 
[00:59:30]  straits came to me and said they need $100,000.  I'm like, I'm not giving you $100,000.  I'll give you a couple thousand.  Wow, someone that wasn't even family?  Family.  And sometimes that's the strategy.  Right.  Ask for a lot, and then they go, you know, you'll come up with a little something.  Right.  Negotiating.  And they really get what they really...  Right, right.  And then this person was very disappointed in me that I didn't do it.  I'm like, look, I got family and other responsibilities here. 
[01:00:00]  I can't come up with that.  There are things.  People fall from grace.  I mean, they go to jail.  They die.  You know what I mean?  I've had, by living as long as I've had, I probably...  There's probably six to ten people on that list of people who borrowed money and can't  get paid back because they're dead.  Yeah, that's it.  I won't see that money no more.  That's like the ultimate test.  Right.  Nobody passes the ultimate test.  Yeah, that's right.  Richard Pryor.  Richard Pryor did that.  Oh, I like you.  That was... 
[01:00:30]  Is it something I said?  The ultimate test.  Yeah.  Jimmy's a huge Richard Pryor fan.  I actually wrote that question now because you talked about Pryor and that you were friends  with him and...  You know, I bet.  We were acquaintances.  Oh, you didn't hang out.  Okay.  Yeah, you know, we never had that tight friendship.  What did he ask you to hold?  Nothing.  You never hold anything for Richard Pryor.  No, what did he ask?  The question was, what did he ask you to hold?  Like in a bag.  We know he didn't do it.  What did he ask you to hold?  Yeah.  In the bag?  Yeah.  You know, that's part of one of his jokes.  You know, he always had, you know, something in the bag and you should never hold a bag if 
[01:01:00]  Richard Pryor asked you to hold it.  Oh, okay.  Because there could be drugs in it.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's kind of like an old one.  Was he nice to you?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I mean, when, you know, I've had special relationships and multiple relationships with  entertainers and, you know, the entertainers all want to be athletes and the athletes all  want to be entertainers.  You know, and, you know, my renditions of people's songs and monologues and stuff like 
[01:01:30]  that is, you know, best kept in the shower, kept in tight quarters.  Although with, who was it?  When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had his roast and he had George Lopez there and I did a little  version of a stand up as a way of roasting Kareem.  And George gave me a high five on that one. 
[01:02:00]  He says, oh man, I'm glad to be a witness to your first stand up.  I loved it.  Bam.  So I was like, that might be validation.  Was it nice to roast him?  Oh, I had to roast him, man.  You know, I've been in the shadow for a lot of years, you know, from, and, you know, even  though he was two years ahead of me, coming out of New York, being a New York, you know,  ball player, flying under the radar.  You're really under the radar when you got Lou Alcindor and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the radar.  So I think I was probably runner up three or four times in the NBA for MVP, second to him. 
[01:02:30]  So, yeah, being in the shadow.  So it was good to roast him.  Can you explain what led, because, you know, you talk about it in the book, you were seeing,  you know, you would have this female, I think her name was Samantha, sports writer would come  and...  From Philly.  Yeah.  And can you explain how she got pregnant?  That's one of my favorite stories that anyone's ever told about anything.  What did you read? 
[01:03:00]  That normally she would just come and give you oral sex, but this time she got braces, so  you couldn't have oral sex because she had metal in her mouth, so you had sex that one  time, and she got pregnant.  When you say metal in her mouth, what do you mean?  Oh, braces.  Oh, I didn't say she had metal in her mouth, did I?  Well, you said, no, you said some type of tin or something that wasn't conducive with  oral sex.  Well, you said, I forget, you named the, you named it as metal or something in the mouth. 
[01:03:30]  I think I named it for what it was.  I mean, she had, you know, uh, she had, uh, braces.  Yeah, but there was another word you used for, I don't remember what it was.  Yeah, I just, I can't remember, but you said something.  It was orthodontia.  It just says, orthodontia to straighten her teeth.  There you go, orthodontia.  That night and that night only, they had intercourse.  Oh, okay, and maybe you did say, like, well, it was something else, it was describing something  unpleasant.  Very high level when you say orthodontia.  That's right, it is nice with a metal in the mouth. 
[01:04:00]  So, is that true?  I mean, is that?  Yeah, I mean, the book is factual.  Well, it's based on fact, as I recall it.  You know, there's no disputing from my standpoint, and this is a first person book.  So, uh, so I think that's, that's when it happened.  It certainly wasn't planned parenthood.  Right, right.  Right.  Yeah, you were married at the time, and then you got the letter that, uh, you know.  Yeah, and 30, I was 30 years old. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  So, some things you look back on at 11, 21, 31, 41, you know, you look back on, and if,  if, uh, if you had to do it over again, you probably would do it a little differently.  But, you know, in that situation, the, the blessing in disguise is that, you know, a beautiful,  uh, young lady who has made a contribution to the world.  A very talented tennis player.  Came out of that relationship. 
[01:05:00]  But the arrangement you had, so, the, your wife at the time basically said, look, you do  everything that's right, you know, make sure you pay child support or whatever, but she  didn't want you to really, uh, have any contact with Samantha at the time.  Um, yeah, well, it became a East Coast, West Coast.  Right.  Because Samantha moved to San Diego.  And so, so that in itself, geography was going to lessen the contact.  And I, you know, I mean, I saw her several times while she was growing up.  Did she know you were her dad all along? 
[01:05:30]  Um, yeah, she knew.  I mean, I, I met her within the first five years of her life.  Oh, okay.  So, so she, I always, I always thought that she didn't know until later on.  Right.  No, no, we met, uh, in the first five years of her life.  In terms of, uh, the later meeting, I mean, it was after she was 16.  Okay.  Uh, you know, when, I mean, obviously we became public when she was 18.  Right.  19, actually.  But, uh, but privately, she, no. 
[01:06:00]  How did your wife find out about, I guess you had to tell her, how did she find out about  it?  No, I, I write it in the book.  You know, there was, Samantha wrote me a letter and, uh, read the letter and I shared  it with my wife.  You showed her the letter?  Yeah.  I showed her the letter.  And then she beat, I was going to say she beat the crap out of you.  That's not fair.  But there was, uh, there was, uh, there was some punches, uh, thrown right after that.  And she, can I say what she called it?  Well, the reaction, yeah.  I don't, I mean, it's tough. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, you don't have to grind it out, but.  Okay.  Yeah, because it is, because it is, because it is a read.  And it's in the book.  And in the context.  Right.  You know, we're talking about children.  So that particular chapter and, you know, I mean, I have four sons, three daughters.  So, so we're talking about children and people being born into this world.  So the circumstances vary with each childbirth and with this particular situation, you know,  there's, there's additional, uh, um, information there, which balances the perspective. 
[01:07:00]  Right.  Because I wanted to be transparent and truthful.  So, so yes, I mean, you know, when I, when I told her about, she was very upset, you know,  I mean, really asked me to leave the house.  I was trying to get out of the house because I was getting bombarded and, uh, verbally and  physically.  So I left the house a couple of days.  Were you, were you concerned at first?  I would have thought like, ah, we had sex one time.  It wasn't lined. 
[01:07:30]  Or did you kind of know that it was like, no, no, I didn't, I didn't know.  No, no.  We had to, you know, test.  Yeah.  There was a test that happened.  Validate through testing.  Um, and, uh, test came back positive.  So, uh, I had to own up.  Well, there are other women up.  And, you know, and, you know, obviously in, uh, the seventies and eighties, I mean, you  know, free love hippies.  I mean, so deadbeats, deadbeats abound. 
[01:08:00]  I mean, you guys probably knew a few or whatever.  I got a child over here, but, you know.  So I'm assuming there were a few other tests.  I'm in, you're in denial.  Right.  So, so they're in, so they're in denial.  And, and, uh, you know, I mean, I, I had my moments in which I had my doubts, but, you  know, test proved positive.  And I said, well, you know, this is what we have to do.  And, and it was a collective decision made to, uh, create a child support situation and 
[01:08:30]  a living arrangement that, uh, allowed me to continue, you know, with my wife and my  family understanding and for Samantha and Alexandra to, uh, exist as they did.  How's your relationship with her now?  Um, I wouldn't say it's the best.  You know, and, you know, the book hasn't made it any better.  The book hasn't made it any better, but, you know, these are part of the challenges 
[01:09:00]  in life.  So, uh, when and if, I mean, there will be a time in which, you know, I have to deal with  the accountability associated with being a father.  And, uh, you know, I mean, I feel there's responsibility there, but there's also, um, an  understanding that at age 32, she's an adult and, you know, at 63, I'm an adult.  So we have to, we have to, uh, communicate with each other as adult to adult. 
[01:09:30]  You said something Bill Cosby told you that it's hard to be, it's hard to grow up poor  and raise rich kids, which I thought was a really interesting way to look at what it's  like to be in that situation.  Um, yeah, I think the difficulty of affluence, uh, is, you know, personifies itself because  you have so many choices that you didn't have.  I mean, I went to prospect elementary school cause it was the local school and I walked 
[01:10:00]  and probably, you know, seemed like three miles.  It was probably a mile, uh, especially when it was cold and wintry and kind of in long  Island, you know, put your coats on bundle up and you know, you got to go to school and  you got to try to be there on time.  And then you, then within that system, you start saying, well, I never want to be late.  I never want to be absent.  I want to be one of those kids, you know, that has never late, never absent.  So, you know, my kids really didn't have to deal with that. 
[01:10:30]  You know, they got chauffeured to school.  I'm the chauffeur or the mom's the chauffeur or we have a driver, you know, who's, who's,  who's taking them and pick them up and dropping them off.  And, uh, and, and within the, uh, the education and social development, so many options for,  you know, people who are affluent that you, you're forced to make decisions that you're  that, you know, when you're poor, you don't have, you don't have to make, you know, Sony 
[01:11:00]  one option, the goal, you stay home, you know, get smart or stay dumb.  Uh, and that's oversimplifying it, but that's the reality of it.  So that, so that's what that was all about.

You can hear me on the Opie and Anthony Show and after Opie and Anthony Live,  and we highlight everything awesome that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show here on the Worst of the Week Countdown. 
[01:15:30]  We'll get to the cell phone number that became public information on the show this week.  We'll get to all the Oliver Stone stuff.  I don't know if you've heard about it, but it's interesting.  Bill Burr in studio.  An appearance by Colin Quinn before any of that.  Right now, Guillermo del Toro is in studio.  Not only is this guy a great director, he did Pants Labyrinth and Pacific Rim in the Hellboy movies,  but he's like a visionary.  He walks around everywhere with this little notebook that's full of doodles and drawings and words. 
[01:16:00]  He's got things to say as well.  He put out a coffee table book that's all the sort of monsters and ideas and stuff.  That he's had.  He has a monster house.  Not like a very big house.  Like a house that he bought that he filled with monster shit.  That he goes to and that's where he works.  I want a monster house.  He's a very interesting guy.  His dad was kidnapped.  He gets into all this.  Wait till you hear it.  Well, you don't even have to wait.  Let's hear it now on the Countdown. 
[01:16:30]  Let's get Guillermo del Toro in studio.  Oh, don't come out.  I've been writing a book.  It's a giant book that smells really good.  Oh, yeah.  Here he comes.  Yes.  Cabinet of my...  Cabinet of Curiosities.  Cabinet of Curiosities.  My notebooks, collections, and other obsessions.  Nice to meet you, sir.  Hey, hi.  Welcome to the O.B. Anthony Show.  Same here.  Big fan of your movies, sir. 
[01:17:00]  I enjoyed Pacific Rim very much.  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  And I go into these movies sometimes, and I'm like, all right, I don't know what this is  going to be about, but I hope for the best.  That was awesome.  It was like old school kind of Godzilla-ish vibe to it, but with amazing visuals.  Thank you.  And the size that you portray with these robots were great.  I thought it was a fun movie to watch.  We spent three years on it, and it was really, if you ask me, I spent 38 years wanting to 
[01:17:30]  make it.  Oh, really?  I mean, it's a movie that is so attuned with my 10-year-old, you know, like, self.  Yeah, yeah.  It was, and inside every guy, there is a 10-year-old constantly.  Uh-huh.  You remain that kid, and hopefully the movie reminds you of what it is to be that.  What were you watching back then?  Sci-fi movies and things like that?  Oh, yeah.  I was a completely freaky kid.  Yeah, yeah?  So was there a lot of Godzilla movies? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, everything.  In Mexico, I was born in 64.  So I came in right at the height of the giant monster movie.  Yeah, yeah.  It was when Godzilla was king.  I went to opening day of many Godzilla films.  Oh, yeah.  What was it?  Remember, Destroy All Monsters came out?  One of the best.  Ghidra and Rodan and Gamera.  Those were the ones I liked.  The more monsters...  Yeah, the better, right?  It's like wrestling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have the good wrestlers and the bad wrestlers, except they are throwing tanks at each 
[01:18:30]  other, buildings at each other.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought the Gargantuans didn't get enough credit.  That is perhaps one of my two favorites.  War of the Gargantuans was a really good movie, too.  Yeah.  The way they moved the hair on their bodies and made it look like real people.  It was just a good one.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  What a lot of people don't know is that it's a sequel to another movie that is lesser  known called Frankenstein Conquers the World.  Really?  Yeah.  And when I was a kid, that movie opened in a tiny cinema in my hometown.  I took the bus, took me an hour to get to the cinema, sat down to see War of the Gargantuans. 
[01:19:00]  In the middle of the movie, somebody throws a big glass of pee from the balcony.  It lands on my head.  Come on.  Here's how much I loved it.  That makes you love the movie, I hope.  No, no, no.  Here's how much I loved it.  I stayed.  Wow.  You stayed with pee on your head.  I came out with a sort of something about Mary hairdo.  Why did they throw a pee?  It was never established?  Well, it's established as a very, it was back then, a very favored prank in the movie.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, man. 
[01:19:30]  We used to just do soda.  We weren't brave enough to do a pee.  Yeah, Northport, remember the Northport?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Thrown soda.  The balconies, yeah.  But that theater I went to is what they used to call in Mexico, they used to call it a one-brick theater.  Because they gave you one brick for the rats.  One brick.  Not a reputable.  Right, right.  So you're helping out as an exterminator while you're watching the movie.  You're doing your duty, yeah.  That was like the golden age of those movies. 
[01:20:00]  Of all horror and fantasy.  Yeah, yeah.  And they were all, they all seemed to be like 90 minutes long.  Like it was an hour and a half.  That's all you needed.  As frankly, every movie should be.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Except, but we seem to have a hard time controlling the past two hours.  Pacific Rim was dead on two hours and 30-something seconds.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But back then you have, in TV you were watching all the Universal Monster movies.  In theaters you have Kaijus and Hammer movies.  Christopher Lee.  Oh, yeah, the best. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought those were, they had a horrifying element to them.  The Hammer film.  I thought he was the best Dracula, Christopher Lee.  With the bleeding eyes.  Yeah, his eyes would bleed.  Oh, it was so creepy.  As a kid you would really get like scared.  And he had a power that, you know, was not creaky.  It was like, this guy could not only absolutely suck the damsels, but he would kick your ass.  Yeah, yeah.  He looked like a, like he would, I was a great fighter.  There was something about going to the movies back then that was such a, now you just kind 
[01:21:00]  of, it's an aside, you know, that you can have a movie you really want to go see, but  it was like, as a kid, when you went to the movies, to the theater to go see it, because  it was something, first of all, you knew you were not going to see this movie again.  Again.  Yeah.  If not ever, it was going to be years if you ever saw it again.  So you had to pay attention and soak it all in and enjoy it.  Back then, I remember one of the big things was if you were able to steal a movie poster.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  If you liked the movie a lot, you would steal a movie poster. 
[01:21:30]  And the only way you could memorialize the movie was by buying the soundtrack on an LP.  Yeah, yeah.  So they were special moments.  Yeah, and now it's easy to just, you know, you get on demand.  It's one of your entertainment options.  Right, one of the many, yeah.  Do you like the remakes and stuff of Godzilla?  Well, you know, I really don't mind remakes if they're good.  Every, remakes or original movies, if they're crappy, it doesn't make a difference.  No, no, they kind of go away.  But the great remakes are great. 
[01:22:00]  What do you think that they miss?  Sometimes it feels like there's something that they don't quite capture, and I don't  know exactly what it is.  Sometimes the remakes...  Nostalgia?  Man, I don't know, man.  I can't even put my finger on what this...  I think it's nostalgia, really.  Some of these movies don't look as impressive as what, obviously, you're doing nowadays.  If you rewatch them, that was the thing with Pacific Rim.  I wanted to make the movie for a new generation of kids.  I wanted the 10-year-olds now to see Pacific Rim and feel what I felt back then.  Right, right.  It was not an exercise in nostalgia. 
[01:22:30]  It was, I would say, reinterpretation, if you want, or passing the torch to a new generation.  You could definitely see the monsters, they were influenced by the monsters of the 60s.  Of course.  They were very strange-looking.  Sometimes you couldn't really get a grasp on what they even were.  This one's half lobster.  It was, it really did, and it conjured up those memories of watching old monster movies  like that.  There's a great anecdote about the first Godzilla, which is 1954. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  With Raymond Burr, where they threw him in.  In the American version.  But the director, Shiro Honda, called everybody into his kitchen before starting the movie,  and he said, I'm making a movie, we're making this movie for real.  We're not being funny about it, we're not, everybody take it seriously.  And that's the way we went on Pacific Rim.  Yeah, yeah.  There was no post-modern wink.  All these things are funny.  We were doing it for real.  Yeah.  We were doing it to be an exciting, seriously entertaining film.  It was good. 
[01:23:30]  You felt like there was that element of impending danger and doom was there, and the heroics  and stuff.  It was, no, I really, I watched that and went like, wow, that was really fun to watch.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  What's your least favorite?  Did you have a least favorite horror or creature that you just couldn't quite get into  when you were a kid?  You know, I like, I have the most brotherly love for monsters.  I love crappy monsters.  I love crappy monsters.  Even the crappy ones. 
[01:24:00]  And sometimes the most charming ones are the crappy ones.  The ones that they look like they need your help.  They're so crappy.  A little poor thing, you kind of feel bad for them.  That poor giant clawed alien needs my help.  I do feel like that.  That's funny.  And your book is a really, it's a really interesting, giant, beautiful book.  And it's called, it's called Cabinet of Curiosity, my notebooks, collections, and other obsessions.  What exactly is it?  These are all just notes you've made?  These have all my notebooks from all my movies. 
[01:24:30]  And they are, these are my notebooks, you know.  I draw in them.  This is for Pacific Rim.  Those are your actual drawings?  Yeah.  That is amazing right there.  So there's my handwriting, my drawings.  And it also includes my collection, which is, in 2005, I was hanging a picture of one.  I collect original art and artifacts and props and books and all that.  And my wife said, you can hang that in there, in the kitchen. 
[01:25:00]  And I thought, I spent my entire life as a kid under my mother.  And now my wife is telling me what I can and cannot do.  So I said, you know what?  I'm going to buy my own house.  So I went and bought my own house.  That's what Jimmy's going to have to do.  It's 10,000 square feet of collection, some of it which is in the book.  Wow.  Basically what I do is I live with my wife and my daughters.  Every day in the morning I go to my own house.  That's awesome.  I spent the day in my house. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  And I can do whatever I wanted.  Right, right.  Hang whatever monster picture, whatever.  And the funny thing is, it took me 40-something years to live the way I thought I should live at age 10.  Now, that's an amazing, what is something you've collected that you absolutely love, a piece of movie memorabilia?  I have truly, it's a museum.  And if you browse through the book, you'll see it.  I mean, it's really quite an amazing collection.  And I have, basically, what I do with every check, when I make any money, I immediately give my wife half. 
[01:26:00]  And I said, we'll share the expenses on the house.  And the other half don't ask me anything.  I'm going to do whatever.  And you cannot tell me how much did that monster cost, how much did this, the house has secret passages.  Wow, really?  One of the secret passages has one room that is called the Rain Room, which is a room that is rigged to have a fake outside where there's a thunderstorm 24 hours a day.  This is great. 
[01:26:30]  We're looking at right now, there's a room.  I love this.  There's a beautiful wood room with, like, you can see the upstairs balcony with a giant Frankenstein head on it.  And there's a, I don't recognize the...  There's the Hellboy Monster.  The Hellboy Monster, sorry, underneath on the ground.  And there's a regular nice rug that every house should have.  And there's just creatures all over.  And there's 560 pieces of original art, all fantastic art.  Just up on this one landing, I'm seeing, like, you got Geiger over here.  Yeah.  And then Hellboy. 
[01:27:00]  Those are originals.  And then what's the pinhead girl here?  From Freaks.  From Freaks, yeah.  I live, what I wanted to do as a kid is live with my heroes of horror.  And if you turn the page, that's H.P. Lovecraft, a horror writer that I admired as a kid.  I haven't made life-size.  So he lives in the house with me.  Like a wax museum type of...  Yeah, but they're all around, like there's a dwarf.  With a razor blade at the end of a corridor.  I call in my alarm system.  Wow, man.  I got to ask you about your other house, though. 
[01:27:30]  How boring is the other house?  Entirely vanilla.  Really?  Like, there's nothing that indicates I'm there.  Do you have people coming?  Wow.  I give tours, like, once a week.  He doesn't like people in his house.  This is your space.  Like, people would try touching shit and wrecking it.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm very careful.  I bet.  I was fortunate.  I was blessed with two daughters, which means they're very careful.  If I had a boy...  Right.  Like, running around trying to play with everything.  What is this?  Crack.  Yeah.  Does your wife go to the other house?  You know, she comes now and then. 
[01:28:00]  I love this.  I get the occasional conjugal visit.  But, in reality, they're separate.  So, you guys have an understanding, obviously.  No, we live...  It's your thing, and you really are into it.  100%.  And she, you know, lets you do it.  People, normal people go to work at 9 a.m., come back at 5.  I do the same.  I mean, I live with my wife and my daughters.  But that's like kind of going to the office.  Instead of the office, you go to your house. 
[01:28:30]  Do you work at this place?  I work there.  Yeah, it's a great atmosphere, I'm sure.  That's where I write.  That's where I design the movies.  Do you ever get creeped out?  Not creeped out, but like, turn around and go, huh, something's there.  There was...  I mean, I've had a few ghost experiences.  Really?  In my life, for real.  You know, I'm a skeptic.  People think I believe all this crap.  Right, right.  I don't.  I'm normally a skeptic.  That's me at age 10.  Well, give us a...  But I bought two cabinets from the 15th century. 
[01:29:00]  And they arrived at the house, and they came with a ghost.  Really?  The house was sort of haunted for about a year and a half until I had a cleansing done.  Oh, you had a cleansing done?  Yeah, I had the cleansing done.  Was it too much?  What were they doing?  Well, the lights would be turned on and off, the footsteps.  I just didn't...  And now I stay there.  I mean, I stay there sometimes until 2 a.m., 3 a.m., and I didn't like being creeped out.  Yeah, of course.  The cleansing worked.  It did. 
[01:29:30]  It did.  Wow.  My mother did it.  My mother is sort of a white witch.  You're a fascinating...  Yeah, very interesting life.  Oh, my God.  I love it.  How far is your house from your other house?  About five minutes.  A five-minute drive.  A five-minute drive?  Yeah.  Yeah, you couldn't be like, yeah, I'm in L.A., and my house is in New York.  No.  Do you sleep in this house once in a while?  No.  When I come back, like, right now we're shooting in Toronto.  I'm shooting the pilot for a horror series for FX, based on my books, The Strain.  And when I go back to L.A., I don't go back to the family house. 
[01:30:00]  I go back to my monsters.  Right.  My wife and daughter stay in Toronto.  I go back, and I...  Does your wife check up on you?  Going, sure.  Or he likes monsters.  I'm too freaky to do anything else.  Why not?  This is your internet point.  This is your internet point.  This is it, man.  This is it.  This is your obsession.  I want to go to this house and look around.  This is great, man.  This is fantastic.  Yeah, what's the address to the house?  Stop behind and...  Yeah, right.  The coordinates.  No, what is great about the house is, honestly, I walk in, and I have a smile. 
[01:30:30]  Instantly.  Yeah.  You know, because you are...  When you're a kid, you're very particular about your room.  You know, every kid has the sign on the door, keep out.  Yeah, yeah.  Right outside the room.  It's basically that.  It's a space where no one can tell you what to do.  Let me tell you a little personal story, Guillermo.  Not to the extent that you have done, but I was laughed at relentlessly at the beginning  of the summer, because I decided I wanted to buy a life-size Velociraptor to put up on 
[01:31:00]  my jacuzzi.  Why not?  I did it, and people laughing, oh, what the hell are you doing?  It looks great.  It looks cool.  The steam comes up from the jacuzzi.  You put on a red light, and you're having a little jacuzzi in Jurassic Park.  And everyone laughs, but then when they come over, they're snapping pictures with it like  crazy.  Absolutely.  Because they want a picture with it.  A hundred percent.  In the book, there is, you know, my car.  When I was a kid, I saw this movie called The Car with James Brolin, a horror movie where 
[01:31:30]  the car was the devil, a great design by Chuck Barrett, who designed the Batmobile.  Fell in love with it.  I said, I'm going to own that car.  I own that car.  You own the car from the car.  I had it made, I had it made, handmade in Mexico in steel.  It's like a tank.  It's in the book.  No doubt.  But I think that all you can do is live the way you want to live.  Right, right, yeah.  Otherwise, you have nothing.  I remember that movie, but I was getting confused with Duel for a minute. 
[01:32:00]  Duel with the truck.  They have the two scariest cars in the history of the car.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dennis Weaver.  He was good in that.  But that car goes like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, had like a very scary horn.  Yeah.  And what you were saying about your Velociraptor, I take the car only on Sundays because it's  too expensive.  If I go, bourbon come back, it's one tank.  Oh, because it weighs a ton.  Yeah, a ton.  So I take it around the block, go buy ice cream. 
[01:32:30]  Like an old man, you know.  Ice cream.  Some people are snapping pictures.  Can I take a picture of your car?  See, this is the life you're supposed to lead when you're a successful guy.  I love it.  That notebook, he opened it up briefly.  It's really cool.  It's beautiful.  You know what it reminded me of when you opened it?  It really is.  It looks like Indiana Jones' father's notebook for the Holy Grail.  It is.  Well, it started like very much like a field notebook, and then I have three of them right  now, and they turned into this, you know. 
[01:33:00]  That has got kind of a Lord of the Rings look to it there.  They are all the notebooks that I bought in Venice in 1997, and they were handmade.  That's great.  Yeah, leather and stuff.  Are those notebooks, is it one per movie, or do you just keep going until the start?  No, no.  They are mixed.  Like, for example, the section that I seal off is sealed off because I have designs from  The Hobbit, which I was in charge of directing that movie, and I can't allow them to be seen  or this and that.  Yeah, yeah.  So I seal them with my little band. 
[01:33:30]  It's one rubber band.  It's keeping the secrets from The Hobbit.  It is.  It is low-key, low-tech.  Yeah, yeah.  No, it works.  You can't lose a thumb drive or anything.  It's your notebook.  There's no way they can hack into the rubber band.  Can't hack the notebook.  Hack into a rubber band.  Let's grab it.  Let's grab it.  We'll go over there for a second.  I've got to ask you about your father.  He was kidnapped.  Oh, yeah, 98.  Wow.  Wow.  Was he in Mexico?  Yeah, he was in Mexico.  He was 72 days late captain. 
[01:34:00]  72 days?  Wow.  Was it a cartel?  No, it was.  The kidnapping, the way the kidnappings are run is they're basically run like franchises.  Wow.  So one person can run two, three kidnappings and run them like convenience stores.  You know, they called, they have a guy that picks up the victim, a guy that negotiates.  It was, back then in 98, it was just a business.  Now it's rampant.  Wow.  Now it's all sort of melded into one single crime. 
[01:34:30]  The guys that do the kidnapping, do the organ traffic, do the drug peddling, everything.  So they kidnapped you, you got a phone call and said.  Oh, we got many phone calls, yeah.  And you knew it was true immediately?  Oh, yeah.  No, the first phone call I got was my older brother called and said, better come home.  He said they took him.  He didn't say anything else.  And I knew what it was instantly.  Wow.  I didn't have an explanation.  Where did they get him?  They got him outside his business, yeah. 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  Yeah, it was.  And was it random?  No, no, you know, they planned it for, those things are planned carefully.  And a lot of the time, they need to know where they're picking him up, what time, what time he arrives.  I'm sure they want to know if you have money, too, at that point.  They do the background.  Yeah.  And, you know, they check with finances.  It's a business.  Wow.  They don't want to invest.  So they got him. 
[01:35:30]  And then you get the call, and what's the process then?  You have to get the money together, or do you try to negotiate?  I tell you this.  There's only one time where three quarters of the way Hollywood got it right.  There's a movie called Proof of Life with Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe.  Three quarters of the way.  If you can imagine, instead of Meg Ryan, a fat Mexican.  And instead of Russell Crowe, an old English guy.  That's the way it is.  You have to bring a negotiator. 
[01:36:00]  The negotiator has to guide you through it, because there's a whole protocol.  If you do it on your own, you're going to screw it up.  What's something that somebody would do on their own that the negotiator would protect you from?  Look at Jerry Lundegaard.  Everything you do instinctively is wrong.  Really?  Like what?  There's a whole protocol.  For example, if you know your limit, and you immediately declare it, and you say, that's what I can get, you're telling them how much you can get now. 
[01:36:30]  So they're going to run the negotiation for longer, to give you an example.  We said, we can only get X, which was a fraction of what they were asking for.  But that told them, if they can get X the second day we called, that means if we wait for 72 days.  Oh, man.  They're going to be able to scrape up more.  Ten things out.  Yeah.  Wow.  But instinctively, you give it your all, because you want him back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a really...  I don't recommend it. 
[01:37:00]  Man, right?  So was he taken care of for 72 days, more or less?  Well, you know, my dad is, I'm sure, like your dad, it's a generation that doesn't talk.  Oh, Jesus, Hopi.  It's a generation that doesn't like to chat about life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a self-made man.  Right.  So he doesn't talk about it, really, what happened.  Like my dad and I, we can go, yep, yep, for two hours.  But basically, that's...  And I don't see him for three years, and then we go, yep.  Yeah.  How are you? 
[01:37:30]  Good, good.  Did he get security after that?  You know, he did for a while, but now he jokes about it, but it's true.  He says, I'm too old for that.  I mean, they won't kidnap him, because he could croak.  Yeah, there's a problem.  There's a problem.  I mean, they only kidnap people that they can keep...  Do you worry when you go to Mexico about...  I take precautions.  Yeah, okay.  You have to, right?  Now I have to.  I have to, especially because in my line of business, people assume...  Let's say that a movie, Pacific Rim, made $400 million. 
[01:38:00]  That you have $400 million.  People think he must have at least 50.  Not true.  Not true.  Yeah.  Not true.  You have to move the decimal points a few times.  Yeah, yeah.  That's fascinating, man.  Wow.  That is really scary.  What a monkey wrench to throw into someone's life.  So you don't like going out of Mexico, I would assume.  Do I like?  I love going.  But you wish you...  I have to go with precaution.  Sure.  I cannot go casually.  And you're not going to film there anymore? 
[01:38:30]  I can't.  That's the biggest loss for me is family life, and the fact that I would love to continue  filming Mexican films.  All the rabble in Toronto.  Let me tell you, that's dangerous living right there.  Very dangerous.  You might sleep yourself to death.  No, it's such a great life right now.  I actually like Canada.  I adore Toronto.  It's a lot of fun up there.  We were in Montreal.  This is a beautiful book.  It's got notes in it.  We spent three and a half years making the book. 
[01:39:00]  So many great pictures, photographs, and artwork in here.  Stories behind everything about all the movies.  I have my car.  Oh, wow.  I just saw that, too.  That's great.  It looks like a Rolls Royce.  It is like the evil twin of a phantom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's gorgeous.  And you're directing The Hobbit.  I was prepping The Hobbit for two years as director.  And we had so much delays that I left. 
[01:39:30]  And obviously, Peter and Philippa and Fran saw the movie to completion.  And Peter directed it beautifully.  But I was so happy being part of it.  I'm part of the screenplay.  Oh, you're not preparing for the next one?  No, no, no.  I thought you were preparing for the next one.  Peter directed them.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking forward to the next installment.  Coming up.  Great anticipation.  Is that directed right?  The second one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The solution is not.  Okay.  I didn't realize that.  I thought they were working on it.  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  Dragon opens his eyes and we all get shut out.  What the heck?  Credit time.  Now sit and wait, you bastards.  Yeah, yeah.  For a year.  Yeah, yeah.  That's just mean.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  That's just mean.  It goes back, though, to something we were talking about earlier with the movies.  And you knew you weren't going to see them again on television.  When a movie came out and then you heard there was going to be a sequel, that was amazingly exciting.  I remember Planet of the Apes and then Beneath the Planet of the Apes was coming out.  And I was like, oh, my God.  Those were my Star Wars.  Oh, yes. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  Amazing, right?  We were there opening day.  Yep.  And I was of the right age where Beneath the Planet of the Apes struck me even harder than  Planet of the Apes.  Yeah, I wonder what that was all about.  Well, those bald, creepy bastards worshipping the bomb.  Yeah.  It was so fucking edgy for them.  That was kind of creepy.  And then Charlton Heston buying it at the end was kind of weird.  Very weird.  Kill them off like that.  Spoiler.  Spoiler alert. 
[01:41:00]  1968 or whatever the hell.  For those that are, they would have trouble catching up.  Yeah.  There you are.  But that was a movie that had one of those amazing reveals at the end, Planet of the Apes  with, of course, the Statue of Liberty and stuff.  You did it, yeah.  That was because you just, if you just walked into that movie and didn't know, you didn't  know.  At all.  Until the end.  You were fooled.  No, and that was, that was what was great, and I'm not, I'm not nostalgic about it, but  what was great about media being so subdued back then is that you didn't know. 
[01:41:30]  You didn't know.  You didn't know.  Right.  It's like me when I go to a sports movie.  I don't know because I'm a fat slum.  I have no idea.  I went, I went to see, I went to see Ron Howard's Rush.  Right, yeah.  And my wife knew more about car racing than me.  She was like, oh, wait until this happens.  I go, is it going to happen this season?  I said, I hope he, I hope he does all right.  He said, you don't know?  What kind of man are you?  I don't know.  Yeah, what kind of man are you?  He's like, shut up.  I'm going back to my monster house. 
[01:42:00]  I have no, my, my, my, my only sport is cappuccino lifting.  I do nothing else.  I can press 500.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love it.  Well, you're brilliant.  I got to tell you.  Absolutely.  What a pleasure having you.  Thank you.  I love that you have a monster house.  Big fan.  It's two of them now.  Now you got a second one.  I bought the second house next door.  And the neighbors think I do porn.  Because all the, all the windows are black.  Yeah.  So they, they think, and they say, is it true? 
[01:42:30]  I was taking the trash out.  And they said, is it true that you're a porn producer?  I said, no.  No, I'm a director.  Only on monster.  Yeah, yeah.  Monster porn.  You had to get a second house for your collection.  I, I was watching vigilantly the neighbors and I was keeping track of, of what was going  on.  And right when I saw their kid moving to college, I knock on the door and I go, hey, I'm your  next door neighbor.  I think I was telling them.  They said, as a matter of fact, we were putting the house off next week. 
[01:43:00]  Wow.  I lugged out.  Wow.  Buys both houses.  That's fantastic, man.  That's awesome.  Guillermo del Toro, again, thanks so much for coming in.  Very, very fun.

The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  Yes, indeed.  My name's Sam Roberts.  You know me from O&A and after Opie and Anthony Live,  and we highlight all the awesome things that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here on the Worst of the Week Countdown, still to come, 
[01:48:00]  the Opie and Anthony Show makes another cell phone number public.  Bill Burr back in studio right now.  This was an interesting day.  Oliver Stone was booked to do the Opie and Anthony Show.  However, he's running late.  He's booked for 9.30.  It's after 9.30.  He's still not there.  Opie and Anthony don't like to stay late.  What are they going to do?  Sam Roberts is sitting there,  not necessarily prepared for an Oliver Stone interview,  but he's sitting there,  and he's going to be there for the rest of the day. 
[01:48:30]  What's going to happen when Oliver Stone is late?  Will Opie and Anthony stay for the interview?  You'll have to listen right now to find out.  I mean, you probably listened earlier in the week as well,  so you know the answer.  But if you somehow haven't,  here it is.  This Oliver Stone thing?  If he's not here by 10,  there's no fucking way I'm staying here.  Not for Oliver Stone?  No!  Sam Roberts.  They would drive Jimmy nuts,  but no, I've got things to do. 
[01:49:00]  Dude, I'll talk to him about Harry Truman all day long.  Harry Potter?  Oh, Truman.  You know what's more important than an Oliver Stone interview?  Making sure my son has a haircut today for picture day.  Oh, that's apparent.  That's way more important than an Oliver Stone interview to me.  Picture day.  Can't you just tell him where the barbershop is?  The berber sheep.  The barber.  The barber.  I'm on a berber shop.  Get my herded.  Yeah, it's a quarter to 10.  What are we going to do?  Hey, that movie, JFK, was great.  Well, thank you. 
[01:49:30]  Thank you, Oliver, for stopping in.  Right.  We're going to have an in-depth interview about fucking world politics  and fucking untold history of the United States and JFK in 15 minutes if you walked in.  Isn't it second?  This is no fucking movie set where, you know, people just sit around waiting.  Why don't you send the lady the lovely wife to get the kid the haircut?  Because I want to take my son to get his hair cut.  Oh, they're walking like...  Oliver Stone, everyone.  Oh, no.  Here he is.  Oliver Stone. 
[01:50:00]  Oliver Stone, what's up?  Here he is.  So.  Roland looks a little dejected.  Roland.  Hello.  What's the latest recon on Mr. Oliver Stone?  Well, the JFK Blu-ray is out now, my friend Anthony.  Well, I could see the Blu-ray.  What I don't see is Oliver Stone.  Right here, I got a little basket called Dick's in the Ass, my friends.  He's on 30th and 6th.  Yeah, that's a dick in the ass to you.  There's no way.  Let me see where 30th and 6th is. 
[01:50:30]  It's close.  Now, this is a grid system, Manhattan.  It's before the garden.  Hold on.  30th and 6th.  We're at...  40...  40...  49.  49 and 6th.  49 and 6th.  Now, that isn't far, but here in New York City...  That's like 25 minutes.  When you have 15 minutes, and he's got to, like...  Check it.  Elevator.  Elevator.  Take your morning dump.  I say the total...  I'll say earliest...  10-0-5, 10-10.  I can't... 
[01:51:00]  10-0-5 works for all of us.  I would actually like to.  I like Oliver Stone.  I know.  This is your call.  But how could...  Somebody's going to call us crazy again.  You are not.  But here it is.  Why?  How could anyone get mad at us for leaving when the show ends?  Like Leno does not sit there and go,  Well, I guess it's going to be a little late today,  so I'm just going to sit around here and tell Mavis I'm going to be late.  And we're just going to wait here for the...  They don't do that.  And last time, didn't he show up at like 11 or something? 
[01:51:30]  Yes!  And I stayed for that one.  I didn't.  So you didn't.  So this one's your call.  Well, our call is,  Call my car.  I'm leaving.  Right.  Not only are we not staying for Oliver Stone,  I feel like we should go home early.  What are you talking about?  You're funny today.  Look, look.  I would love to,  but I don't have the time.  If he was here right now,  like he was supposed to be at 930, 
[01:52:00]  we would be yapping,  having a good time,  throwing the ball around.  And we...  Speaking of the ball,  that's Dr. J tomorrow.  Oh, what time he show on?  Fucking noon?  Jesus Christ.  I like the Dr. J.  This is...  So we can get wherever you want signed.  How come?  Yes, sir.  They didn't leave wherever they were  a half hour earlier than they did.  Comment?  Comment?  That's the mysterious question.  Is it conspiracy?  Or you have one of those Italian drivers,  hey, I can get you anywhere in five minutes. 
[01:52:30]  I'm like, all right.  Blame the Italians now.  That's great.  What do they have to do?  Where do you ever get an Italian driver,  by the way, in Manhattan,  driving anything?  Because it's...  Look at the fucking...  Look at the license.  It'll always say sing.  That's every fucking driver in this city.  Yep.  S-I-H-N-G, whatever it is.  I have no idea how they're sold.  Wow.  I would love...  Yeah, bring him in here.  All right, we got the after show.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Sam Roberts.  Oh, my God.  I'll be listening on the way home. 
[01:53:00]  Look, I only watched the history  up until Eisenhower,  so it may be...  That's good.  He also doesn't like Reagan.  Yes.  I could have guessed.  Is he even in his movies?  I don't like him either.  I get done.  He's late to everything.  We'll just do the after show.  So let's wrap it up.  And...  Let's go.  And by the way,  have that cocksucker sign that for me.  Rowan's sitting here  trying to wrap this up  in case he walks in like now.  Yeah, it would be a problem.  So there's no one like this for him.  Have him sign that shit for me. 
[01:53:30]  Let's make a...  All right, boys.  And the book.  Let's make a bonfire.  Yeah, sign all this crap.  And have him sign this.  Right.  Have him sign everything.  That's right.  That's his punishment  for being fucking late.  You sign our shit.  We'll pick it up tomorrow.  We'll get a five minute interview.  And the 25 other minutes  are going to be convention style.  Yeah.  Signing.  That's right.  All right.  We said she does this.  All right.  All right, everybody.  Get together.  It's Platoon.  Scene 38. 
[01:54:00]  Starting film.  Where's Oliver?  Oh, he's not here yet  to direct his own movie.  He's late.  Whatever.  That's okay.  Whatever.  Oliver, the director  isn't here for the movie.  You think he shows up  late for his movies?  You think Kevin Costner  was sitting there  on the set going,  where's Oliver?  Possibly.  No.  Who was the guest  that we walked out  right in front of them?  Ricky Gervais.  Ricky Gervais.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  No, we did it  to somebody else, too. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, we did.  The list is long.  I know.  A long and prestigious list.  There was one,  the beauty of doing radio.  A lot of these guys  don't know what we look like.  We walked out  and they were standing  outside the door.  It wasn't Ricky Gervais.  No, you're right.  This was somebody  waiting to come in  and we awkwardly  walked past them  and they didn't know  it was us.  It could have been  Tom Hiddlestrom from Thor.  It could have been  David Tyree from the Giants.  No, I ducked my head down  and I knew who it was.  It was an older guy.  It was a biggie. 
[01:55:00]  It was a biggie.  James Cromwell.  James Cromwell.  Ah, James Cromwell.  Jim and me  interviewed James Cromwell.  But then we interviewed him  and we had a blast.  I liked it.  Anthony goes,  you're going to have  a good time in there.  And he's like,  what's he doing?  I did.  What's he doing?  You're going to have  a good time in there.  What's he doing?  Yes.  I'm like,  girl, walk fast.  I'll be listening.  I'll be listening  on my drive home.  Your Mexican accent  comes out.  I know because...  What's he doing?  This is my fear.  What's he doing?  What's he doing?  What's he doing?  I go smear.  All right, muchachitos. 
[01:55:30]  Let's go.  Wrap it up.  What is he doing?  This is our Friday.  10, 5, 4, commercial.  No.  We'll put in our time there, Roland.  You've done enough.  We have.  You have.  Uh-oh.  Oliver Stone is right  outside the studio.  All right.  He's right there.  No, I'm kidding.  Roland.  Where is he, Roland?  Tell Kenny  he gets the cars.  Where is he now?  Let's go.  He's still stuck in traffic.  Kenny! 
[01:56:00]  We're just wasting time.  I'm out of here, Kenny.  All right.  Here he goes.  Look, Kenny's taking the walk.  So, you get one.  I'm giving one to Travis.  All right.  He wants to.  Look how flustered he is.  You get one.  But Roland,  at least people don't know that.  We will stay late.  We don't do that.  Johnny never did that.  Uh-uh.  He did it once.  What?  I don't know.  He didn't stay late.  No, he just left.  He was like,  fuck this place.  Oh, what time is Frank getting here?  I'll wait for Frank Sinatra.  No, he left. 
[01:56:30]  But he is Johnny Carson.  But we're Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That used to have some juice.  Not so much these days.  All right.  Are you kidding?  Jesus.  We'll try again tomorrow, boys.  Try again tomorrow.  Who do we have tomorrow?  He just checked in  so we could bring him back  to the after show now  or we could wait.  Roland is freaking out. 
[01:57:00]  I swear to you today,  I can't sleep.  I can't either.  No, no.  That's fine, though.  Sam can do it.  Because I see it in your face.  You need us.  But I swear today,  I really can't.  That's all right.  I can't.  He wasn't.  No, I'd love to,  but I can't.  How about that to Sam?  Sorry, I'm prepping for it.  Oliver Stone.  Yeah, you got him prepped.  All right, so I'll go get him then.  Can't wait to listen to this.  He's coming up the stairs now, so.  He's coming up the stairs now.  He's pretty famous, though, huh?  To walk yonder.  You want us to walk away.  He wants you guys to take a hike. 
[01:57:30]  Hey, you know what?  Tell him sorry.  The show was fucking 10 o'clock.  Right.  It ends.  I don't stay late for nobody.  No.  No, we know that.  Wow.  He said adios, muchachitos.  I, uh, yeah.  I mean, really.  I just don't care about, like,  I don't know.  These are awesome.  I talked to them already.  All right.  And, and, and.  Can I meet him?  I need a picture.  Oh, Jesus.  Tell him you're the engineer.  You look tired,  so maybe next time we see him.  Oh, damn. 
[01:58:00]  I'd love to say that.  That was low blow.  No.  Damn, that was.  That was mean.  It was mean.  I can see that thursing sign.  Yeah, for Jimmy, yeah.  So when he's here talking,  he's like,  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, God, there he is.  Oh, my God.  Uh-oh.  Oh, now you're being pointed at.  There's a problem.  Okay.  There's a problem now.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  Okay.  What the fuck?  I don't see Howard staying late for a guest.  Okay. 
[01:58:30]  Maybe he does.  I don't know.  Easy transition.  Easy transition.  There we go.  Now, it's the after show.  I guess so.  Look how quick that was.  Like a moth metamorphosizing from a fucking whatever.  Thank you.  All right.  Okay.  Can I sit in the corner and watch the interview?  What?  Imagine you just sit here and watch it.  That would be great.  All right.  Have fun.  I'll be listening.  Oliver Stone's making his way in.  I've been on this show before.  Not with me before.  No.  No, no, no.  I've been in this room. 
[01:59:00]  You have been in this room, Mr. Stone.  How are you?  Welcome.  How are you?  Who are you?  What's your name?  My name is Sam Roberts.  Okay.  It's a pleasure to meet you.  Huh?  Who are you, though?  Opie?  No, no, no.  Opie.  I'm filling in for Opie and Anthony.  Oh, what the hell?  Well, you...  I came to see Opie and Anthony.  I know.  We all did.  But they have a stringent schedule that they have to adhere to.  Oh, shit.  Is that the ones I talked to before?  Yes.  Oh, too bad.  That's all right.  They wanted to give me a turn.  You'll have fun.  Don't worry about it. 
[01:59:30]  And your name is Sam?  My name is Sam.  I'm happy to have met you.  This is a show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there's tons of people listening.  Everybody's like...  Yes, we are.  We're live.  We're live all this time?  Oh, yeah.  I walked in.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's why people listen.  They like the realism and the naturalness.  And you have to be excited.  Is it nice to be able to go out and have a ton of stuff to promote?  Do you like that...  No.  You don't like that?  No, I'm not a very good promotional person, but I try.  I feel like we make the best effort. 
[02:00:00]  Do you like working on a lot at once?  Or do you tend to just focus?  I like to be retired, wiggling my toes in the ocean and just taking it easy with beautiful  girls around.  See, that sounds great, but I don't believe that, because anybody who wants to be retired,  I would think, isn't going to say...  What's wrong with retirement?  I think it's a good thing, but I don't think that somebody who wants to be retired says,  I want to make a 12-hour documentary on America.  Believe me, believe me, after doing that, I think I have...  I met my maker.  You know, that was a tough one. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Now, you strike me.  I was watching...  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.  Put the headphones on.  Join the show.  Have a great time.  Good idea.  You strike me.  Give me a coffee.  Yeah.  I just come from Democracy Now with Amy.  Somebody bring Mr. Stone a coffee.  I've been at it since 7 this morning.  Jesus, and how long?  All day press?  And all night.  All night tonight, too?  No, I was hanging out last night.  This is what happens.  You get to New York.  I did Piers Morgan last night.  How was that?  9 to 10, and then I did a...  Piers is great.  You know him, right?  Yeah, of course.  He's been in before.  He's a very charming man. 
[02:01:00]  And you guys probably line up the same on a lot of your opinions politically.  Possibly.  I would think so.  We didn't get to the bottom of that.  How difficult is it for you to try to separate...  Because I watched the Untold History of the U.S.  I've been watching it.  It took me several days.  Did you really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fabulous.  Very few people actually sit and watch, because it's really a lot of work.  And it's a movie.  It's a real movie.  But it is good in the sense that you're telling stories.  You know what I mean?  It's not that sort of... 
[02:01:30]  You don't feel like you're in history class.  There's no...  And no...  You know, as a documentary, there's no talking heads, which always slows down films and  make these heavy, tedious points.  I mean, it is a flow.  It goes like poetry.  The imagery, the cutting is like JFK.  You know, I remember the scene in mixing documentary with narration.  It flows.  Yeah.  It's got poetry.  And you did an amazing job of the found footage that you got, not just in the newsreel stuff,  but in the animations and the sort of like the World War II stuff where, you know, Russia's 
[02:02:00]  taking over all the land and everything, I would assume most of that was not originally  produced for you.  It was of the time.  Actually, we did.  We looked for all the maps we could get, but some of them are difficult to render.  We also did modern maps, which is to say we went back into those eras and we did modern  creations of those maps, which are even easier to read for the audience, because maps are  crucial to understand.  With the biggest land grab was the British Empire, you know. 
[02:02:30]  So, let's be honest, when you said the Russian Empire, it was the British Empire that had  the most amount of territory.  Now, how long did this take, the whole thing, from start to start?  Five years.  Five years.  Off and on, though.  I did W, I did Wall Street, Money Never Sleeps, and Savages, as well as the South of the Border.  But during this period, I was always working in terms of going back to history.  And did you treat, because the documentary is broken up into 10, and then on the Blu-ray,  12 chapters.  Right.  Did you treat them like individual pieces when you were building it, or did you treat 
[02:03:00]  it?  Every one had to be 58 minutes and 30 seconds.  It is discipline.  It's like television.  Right.  You have to tell your, you know, set your hook, sell the story.  And you have to go, you have to go, stick to the big picture, what you think is the big  picture.  All this has been fact-checked more than once.  It was a tedious rewrite job.  And to simplify, I mean, you see the prose.  I mean, the book is 800 pages.  You know, how to get that down to 58 minutes for each decade is the key.  So you have to stick to the big picture, big narrative line. 
[02:03:30]  And we use movie clips, don't forget.  And they're very helpful to cut through, because the movies are of that time.  Right.  And it kind of like, you know, they'll show whatever, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, or whatever  movie that relates to the era in the issue that they're talking about.  How hard is it for you, though, to remove opinion?  Because this is something you're passionate about.  And obviously, you have opinions on this stuff.  And the opinions do bleed through, you know.  And that's part of what makes it Oliver Stone's.  Good.  Well, you know, Sam, I have to say, really, that I approached this with a historian. 
[02:04:00]  And I never considered myself a historian.  I was a dramatist.  I was dramatizing history.  But I worked very closely with Peter Kuznick, who wrote the book with me, and wrote these  chapters.  He had a staff.  He was an American University professor of history.  He taught it for 30 years.  He's a director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American.  He specialized in atomic bomb and scientists.  And, you know, everything we did was just refined and refined. 
[02:04:30]  Now, there's a lot of, a body of facts.  We select the facts that we think are important.  Sure.  And we give you, you know, there is a flow.  And at the end of each chapter, sometimes in the middle, we do speculations.  Speculations and opinions, as you say.  And as I was watching, I mean, and the kind of overall thing.  Like, it's no secret to me that you were not a fan of Harry Truman, for example.  I think we did show you a body of evidence that he was not the man that you had, that you thought 
[02:05:00]  he was.  Right.  That he was not up to that vision that Roosevelt had started and stood for as the grand alliance  between the Soviet Union, the British, and the Americans.  So, and is that a goal of yours, for people to come out?  No, it was no goals.  There was no goals.  I mean, Peter has been studying this thing, felt strongly about the atomic bombs, that  the two original atomic bombs did not have to be dropped.  But we made our case.  And, by the way, I would like to say this is not Peter's history.  This is, he studied under the revisionists.  The revisionists came into being really around the Cold War, but they started writing. 
[02:05:30]  A lot of them were younger, and they started writing in 1959.  You had people like Fleming, like Gar Alperovitz, Richard Appelman, William Appelman Williams,  Lloyd Gardner, Gabriel Kolko.  It's a body of history that we built on.  It's not like we went out there and decided to attack Truman.  That's what you make it sound like.  It's not at all.  No, Truman had been attacked.  And Walter Lippman, who was one of the great minds of that era, was very critical of Truman's 
[02:06:00]  doctrine, the Truman Doctrine, in March 1947, lending $400 million, giving $400 million  to Greece and Turkey, saying, look, we're going to be fighting communists and terrorists.  He used those words, you know, everywhere in the world.  Everywhere in the world.  He made it a principle, basically.  And by doing that, he was fighting the people who had, in fact, fought the Nazis in Greece.  You have to understand, it was a huge, at that time, in 1947, that was a divider.  And people of Walter Lippman's stature were attacking Truman.  So we're not out there in left field coming at you and saying we're doing a real right 
[02:06:30]  job on Truman.  This stuff is old.  It's been written about, but it's been ignored.  And basically, the American government and American history has moved to the right.  And the body, the so-called assumed evidence, has moved more and more to the right.  We're trying to do justice to history and say, no, keep in mind what was really happening  in that time period.  Where do you think network news now leans?  And obviously, you have a channel like Fox News that I feel like unapologetically leans 
[02:07:00]  to the right.  But do you think that...  Oh, yeah.  We're living in an age of, you know, that's, it's hollow, hollow news.  I don't...  I think you have to study history, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't get the patterns of things.  You can't understand what's really happening unless you look at history.  Well, yeah.  And part of going through your, all the documentaries is that you kind of see where things start  to change, and you kind of see after World War II, it becomes, things become shrouded  in secrecy, and there's a lot more.  Right away.  Right away.  Right.  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  Do you think, though, first of all, do you think we're also promoting JFK, the big Directors  Cup, Blu-ray, box set, huge thing that's coming out on Tuesday, 50th anniversary of JFK's  death, do you think that that was an inside job?  Do you think there was conspiracy?  You're jumping around a lot here.  I know.  Yeah, but in historical terms, it's very... I don't know how serious you want to get,  but, you know, look, Truman comes along, and we go quickly from a World War II situation,  we accelerate into a national security state. 
[02:08:00]  Eisenhower comes into office in 52 and continues the growth of that national security state.  We become armed to the teeth.  And the thing that was interesting about Eisenhower is when you watch it and you see in the context,  you see that this is where this whole trend of going into countries and overthrowing leaders  and all that started.  Yeah, you know, under Eisenhower and his and Secretary of State Dulles, we had a huge interventions  in Iran, in Guatemala.  We tried in Indonesia to get rid of Sukarno. 
[02:08:30]  We tried to get rid of Lumumba in Angola.  Yeah.  We repeated.  And in Vietnam, we participated with the French.  We supported their war.  We financed most of it.  And nuclear threats were made against China, were made against Russia.  Eisenhower is not at all what he seems, although at the end of his regime, in his farewell address,  he does address that horrible issue about the military-industrial complex, which he helped create.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We went from approximately a little more than 1,000 nuclear weapons under 1952 to approximately, 
[02:09:00]  by 1962, under Eisenhower's budgeting cycle, 30,000 nuclear weapons.  We were 10 to 1, at least 10 to 1 stronger than the Soviet Union, although the Soviet Union was pictured as threatening to us.  And it's insane, too, when you think about it in the context of only a few years before that,  the whole idea of a nuclear bomb was this sort of foreign sci-fi movie weapon.  Well, Jewish scientists in Europe had been developing it, and we brought many of them to America and get it here. 
[02:09:30]  And they were brilliant.  And what Henry Wallace and Oppenheimer knew is that this was not a secret.  They would eventually, everyone would eventually get it because scientists are brilliant men.  They work for different countries and so forth and so on.  And there was espionage, too.  But I asked you about the JFK conspiracy.  Yeah, let's go back to that.  But I'm just saying that under Eisenhower and Truman, you have two older men who build up this,  we are the most formidable power on Earth. 
[02:10:00]  In 1960, a young man comes in, and he's facing all of a sudden a military that has essentially reached a place where,  and I'm going to cut right to the chase, their thinking is, look, we've had five or six major crises with the Soviets now.  The communists are definitely our worst enemies, and we have to deal with this.  They are going to get stronger over time.  We now have this first-strike capability.  We can take them out.  And this is hard thinking now.  And if they retaliate, we can sustain the casualties. 
[02:10:30]  This was the basis of that movie, Dr. Strangelove, which Kubrick did so brilliantly.  He even found that the General Jack Rippers, the General George C. Scott in that movie, they were talking in these terms.  Kennedy found himself in a similar situation.  He was a bit like that president in the movie.  He was more of a peaceman, and he did not want war.  He did not want to support the Bay of Pigs invasion, which Eisenhower would have done.  When we went in there, they needed air support from the U.S. to carry through the invasion.  They didn't get it. 
[02:11:00]  They thought they'd get it.  Kennedy did not give it.  He fired Alan Dulles.  At that point, you begin to see the split right away between Kennedy and the CIA and the military.  Sure.  That's a big thing.  And so, because I wonder, you know, we were talking about the secrecy that came into the government before.  And I feel like, as far as grand conspiracies go, especially when you're talking about a JFK, when you're talking about a 9-11, whatever it is, the bigger the conspiracy, the more people that have to be in on this thing.  And I find it hard to believe with a lot of these, especially with JFK, it's been 50 years, that nobody would have by now. 
[02:11:30]  Well, people have talked.  I mean, there's all been all kinds of leaks.  It's just, you know, I mean, you're jumping ahead.  I mean, I'm just trying to tell you that let's build the story a little bit so you understand the hostility to Kennedy, because that's what we do in Untold History.  We don't go into the assassination.  Yeah, but I don't have 12 hours.  But it's important to understand that Kennedy had made many enemies by 1963 when, you know, he refused to go into Laos. 
[02:12:00]  He sent non-combat advisors to Vietnam.  They wanted a war.  We had built up this place where we really wanted to go to war.  We wanted to lock in and do the final solution.  So there was a reason to people not want Kennedy to be in his seat.  I would say.  Yeah.  I would say.  And that's not debatable.  He fired Dulles and he fired the three other top people at the CIA.  He thought his generals, he made critical comments on his generals, which is historically factual.  We're not making this up.  He was.  And by the time of the missile crisis in 1962, after the Berlin scare, we almost had a war in 1961 with the Berlin crisis. 
[02:12:30]  And Kennedy said that famous quote.  He said, I'd rather have a wall than a war.  He meant it.  Yeah, sure.  So, you know, a nuclear war is not for the fun.  I mean, in Cuba, the 62 situation, it was much heavier than we thought.  McNamara, after that crisis, when he found out the facts, that they were much more armed than we thought they were.  They had 100 nuclear battlefield weapons, 40,000 Russian troops commanded by the commander of Stalingrad. 
[02:13:00]  The Cubans were 270,000 soldiers, well armed.  Yeah.  We would have had much more casualties than we had planned.  We wanted to invade Cuba because if we couldn't invade Cuba, which is 90 miles from our shores, we considered ourselves impotent.  With all this weaponry we had, here we were, defeated by a little David.  We were Goliath.  You know who you remind me of?  You remind me of my dad.  I'll tell you why.  My dad was like, and this is a good thing.  My dad was an ad executive for a long time.  And that's why he spent all his time at work and everything.  But whenever I had history homework to do, that was where he was passionate. 
[02:13:30]  I never saw him passionate until he was talking to me about United States and world history.  And I feel like there are guys like him and guys like you who have these amazing jobs.  You're a film director.  Yeah, I have to tell the story.  And I feel like your passion, I feel like you should have been a history teacher.  Is that something you always wanted to do?  I consider myself a dramatist, but I love history, and I like to dramatize it.  My father was also dramatic, but he was very conservative. 
[02:14:00]  So I had the anti-Roosevelt point of view.  And do you think that that's...  Oh, Eisenhower.  Do you think that your dad, being conservative, pushed you in the other direction?  No, because I had to find out.  It took me 30, until I was about 38 years old.  Before you really established a good opinion?  Yeah.  I mean, it was slow.  It was not easy to do.  So I had to go to Vietnam.  I had to learn my own way through life.  Were you a history buff growing up?  Yes, yes.  You were.  So even in your party days...  I loved the cowboys and Indians stuff. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  I did.  And I saw the Viet Cong in Vietnam as Indians.  Let's be honest.  I mean, put it primitively.  What do you think of the Redskins' name change?  I think it would be a good idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So Kennedy had reached a place where, because of the missile crisis, he was considered a soft belly, a guy who could not stand up to communism.  He was not of the caliber of Eisenhower.  Because people thought that was the time to do this war.  Eisenhower told him to go into Cuba. 
[02:15:00]  When they had those missile sites in there and the Russians put them in, he said, go.  All his older men, Dean Acheson, all the people, the wise men of our administration said, go, go.  But we didn't know what we were headed for.  We would have headed for 100,000 casualties probably.  And it would have escalated into a massive thermonuclear winter.  It would have been the end of civilization.  Of course.  But we did not know it then.  And Kennedy had guts.  We didn't have an idea then?  No, because we really didn't.  Once you start the nuclear weapon thing. 
[02:15:30]  No, because they didn't think the Soviets had that kind of weaponry.  We were 10 to 1 military superiority.  Sure.  But still, they had subs.  They were crude subs.  But they would have done some damage.  Yeah.  And the thing is, we would have attacked.  We would have wiped out Russia.  We would have wiped out China, too, because that was definitely in our PSYOP plan.  And we had 600 million casualties planned on that.  I mean, Eisenhower built up this thing.  Eisenhower didn't want to get into a conventional war.  He wanted a nuclear war to solve things quickly. 
[02:16:00]  He wanted the threat of nuclear war to keep us out of war.  But now we'd escalated past Eisenhower to this point where we're willing to use.  Curtis LeMay was the Air Force Chief of Staff.  LeMay had been the terror bomber who'd wiped out 100 Japanese cities.  And civilians were killed and so forth.  He had no compunctions about not dropping these bombs.  It's amazing to me that this is all, like, I would think that a person to come into an interview with this kind of information, you'd have to research it the night before and figure it out. 
[02:16:30]  But this is all just, all these stories are just right there for you.  Well, within reason.  I mean, come on.  There's a lot of facts in the book.  There are tons of facts.  I'm trying to cover this in a soundbite.  You're telling me, well, I'm trying to say that Kennedy said no.  Right.  When he said no, this was a huge thing.  It was, he, 62 was a turning point.  And then within a year of that, he was doing a limited test ban treaty with, with Khrushchev.  Khrushchev and he were starting to, moving towards a detente of the Cold War, which is very crucial.  He was moving towards, he said that very famous speech, Kennedy called off the space race with the Soviets. 
[02:17:00]  He said, why don't we go to space together?  He made the peace speech at American University.  He's the first president who finally, finally, after Roosevelt, recognized the Soviet contribution in World War II, which was to win the war.  Basically, they took 27 million casualties fighting the Germans.  So, you know, he did a lot to close the Cold War out.  He was moving in that direction and he was stopped cold in Dallas on that day because he would have been reelected. 
[02:17:30]  He was popular, by the way, for having said this and done this.  But what do you think?  So you think the reason that more hasn't been made of this is because the people who are coming forward with information are kind of being silenced, not taken seriously?  Well, let me finish my point.  Believe it or not.  Your questions are refining themselves as you're listening.  Well, I am listening, but they're in my headphones telling me you have other interviews to do.  Okay.  I would sit here with you for three fucking hours if I could. 
[02:18:00]  The point is that we had an interest in maintaining our superiority, maintaining the Cold War.  Yeah.  It's a financial interest.  We had a very strong interest in going into Vietnam and staying there and creating and fighting communism on all fronts across the world, which we did.  Lyndon Johnson, when he took office, continued exactly in the vein of Eisenhower.  So, in other words, the torch went back to the old men, from Johnson to Nixon to Ford to Reagan.  It's more and more conservative people. 
[02:18:30]  This is where the United States, in that brief three years with Kennedy, had a shot to go in another direction.  And that was it?  That was it.  And it was the last one, if you look at it.  Clinton had a brief moment.  Carter had a brief moment.  Obama talked that way.  But none of those guys have succeeded.  Do you think when these guys come in and talk about it and get you excited, like maybe he's the guy that they're told something that we don't know that stops them?  Do you think Obama has shown something behind a door?  Yes, I do think a lot of that goes on.  And I think you're surrounded as president with military security and intelligence people who are telling you, 24 hours a day, focus on this. 
[02:19:00]  Focus on that.  There's a threat from this country.  There's a threat on your life.  I mean, that's constant.  I do think we have a monster shadow government that we can't control.  And I think this NSA thing with Snowden and all this stuff, it's out of control.  I mean, you have to understand that the more you give the military, the more you give intelligence, the more they take.  And they don't know the line.  There's no end to what they will do.  Well, listen, they're yelling at me in my headphones because I'm supposed to release you.  I would talk to you for hours. 
[02:19:30]  I think you're a fascinating man.  I saw you as a hard case.  I'm trying to just get you thinking in some new directions.  Yeah, I like it.  I like it.  I like what you do.  Now, JFK, 50th anniversary of his death.  The commemorative DVD, Blu-ray, everything box edit's huge.  It's in stores on Tuesday.  Untold History of the United States, the book and the Blu-rays are out now.  Well, in the JFK thing, a commemoration is Chapter 6 of Untold History, the Kennedy chapter, which is a great chapter.  It is a great chapter.  So check that out. 
[02:20:00]  Now, let me ask you, too, real quick.  Are you glad that you made a sequel to Wall Street?  Yes.  You are glad?  I do.  Okay.  Because a lot of people were worried about it at first, but I think the movie went over pretty well.  See it again.  It shows you Wall Street in 2010, and the other one shows you 1987.  There's a contrast.  And is the Martin Luther King Jr. biopic, is that happening?  Is that the next thing?  I can't say it's happening, but I'm writing.  Hopefully, that's your next move.

Well, let's get him on the phone, man.  When you meet somebody and ask for a picture, do you lose status with them?  And sometimes you do, but enough people have been on this radio show, sat where Bill is sitting,  and then I see them a month later, and they have no idea we've ever met.  So I'm like, even a real interaction, and I give them a great interview, and it means nothing. 
[02:26:00]  So my interaction with them don't mean anything anyway.  But look, I think if you come in and do a radio show, they usually have the banner in the background.  It's part of the whole promoting whatever the project you're doing.  That's different, but I'm just saying, you know.  It's an event.  He's playing golf with the guy.  Well, Voss probably has like a dummy joke.  Okay.  You've got to say it like, hey, man, let's take a picture together.  You've got to make it look like two pals instead of, you know, they turned him into a zoo animal.  Rich.  Hey, how's it going?  Bill Burr was just telling the Don Cheadle story. 
[02:26:30]  Sort of.  I want you to tell it.  What happened was I was at a golf course.  I wish you met him while you were buying donuts in the same place he was.  Boogie nights.  And so it was, I guess, you know, during like Last Comic or whatever.  And the director of Last Comic, Shani, was good friends with Don Cheadle.  I mean, like, you know, they play golf all the time.  And so Don Cheadle's finishing up his round. 
[02:27:00]  I'm giving a short line.  And he comes up to me.  He goes, hey, man, you're really funny.  I like you.  You're really good on this show.  And I said, oh, okay, thanks.  And I go, you know, I like the couple things you did.  And then like a minute, he's getting ready to leave.  I go, can I take a picture with you?  And he went from, like, entertainment pier.  I went from entertainment pier to, like, fat female groupie. 
[02:27:30]  And his face just dropped like, oh, okay.  He thought he was having, like, a moment with just another guy playing golf.  And then he realizes the entire time you guys were playing golf, you were just waiting for the moment to ask him for a picture like a little fanboy.  Yeah, and the thing is, then I saw him at the Oscars.  And he... 
[02:28:00]  You asked for a video.  Can you introduce my podcast?  I asked if I could sit next to him when I go to his nomination for Hotel Rwanda.  But, no, he kind of like, ugh, there goes that fucking groupie again.  And I don't know, like, Norton does it with anybody that anybody has done from, like, Red Eye and up.  Norton will...  Are you mad that I haven't asked you yet?  And, you know, can I have finger prints, whatever.  And he has no problem with it. 
[02:28:30]  You know, and I just...  The one time I do it, I did it, like, twice in my life.  Oh, no, three times.  I went to Kareem Adu-Jabbar to get Norton in order.  Kareem Adu.  We don't know who Kareem Adu-Jabbar is, Rich.  Adu.  That must have been brutal, because I've heard that he's not the most cordial guy.  No, he's absolutely not.  Yeah.  Well, I walked up to Walt Frazier at a Knick game.  He was, yeah, and I go, can you sign this hat?  I handed him the marker the wrong way, and I got it all over his hand. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, lucky it was him.  He didn't notice it.  He was so pissed off, right?  That's great, what an ass.  It's like after shows, people go, can I take a picture with you?  And they come up to you, and they don't know how to fucking work their iPhone.  It drives me nuts.  You know, look, look, can you fucking take the picture?  I'm trying to sell CDs, okay? 
[02:29:30]  Obviously, I didn't hit bonus, so I need to make some kind of fucking money.  You and your fat fucking chick take the picture and move on, right?  How hard is it to work with the camera, okay?  If it was a car wreck, you'd have no problem videoing it.  You'd fucking put it on Instagram.  I'm just picturing Rich coming up to Walt Frazier's waist and just handing him a sharpie like a shank.  Oh, God.  And ink all over his fingers.  He was so mad, and what I really wanted to say is, 
[02:30:00]  look, just sign the fucking hat because, all right, nobody cares about you anymore,  and to me, you aren't half as good as Raul Monroe anyhow.  Why are you mad at him?  Because you put ink on him, and he didn't like it, and you're mad at him.  I love Raul Monroe, too, but fucking Frazier blew him away.  Are you kidding me?  You thought Frazier was better than Earl Monroe?  Absolutely.  Earl Monroe was a great schoolyard player, of course.  But I think Frazier was better, yeah.  No.  I think Frazier was a good, you know, setup guard, but Earl Monroe was more fun to watch. 
[02:30:30]  He was the point guard, of course.  I think we're getting off course here.  Yeah, I know.  My goodness.  Okay.  We had Dr. J in yesterday, Rich Voss.  What do you think of him?  Hey, Rich, who'd you like better, Otto Graham or Red Grange?  How fucking old are you?  I mean, that's why I watch basketball, you know.  How old am I?  I'm quite old, Billy, and you shouldn't talk to your elders that way, okay? 
[02:31:00]  Dude, I'm right behind you, man.  You got a couple good years, okay?  It's going to fucking end.  Believe me, it's going to end.  It's like your first fucking run where you had that dumb shit gone with Molly Ringwald.  You're walking around New York like you're the biggest fucking shit.  Jesus, Rich.  Wow.  Stop vomiting on your secret resentment.  Yes.  I'm just trying to show this boy a little reality.  It all fucking ends, okay?  So just have your shit in place, and remember, we were your fucking friends. 
[02:31:30]  All right?  Dude, you sound like somebody in a townie bar.  Don't quit having these fucking guys.  Hey, don't forget where you came from.  Yeah.  Okay?  Don't go changing on us.  Listen, Rich, I'm going to have my assistant send you my new cell phone number.  Oh, please get one just to do that.  Okay.  All right, Rich.  All right, Rich.  Thank you, Rich.  Oh, thank you.  Bill Burr. 
[02:32:00]  There was a couple things.  Oh, the Rolling Stone.  There's so much stuff we already did, but we didn't do it for the people.  Well, Rolling Stone Magazine, first of all, someone's got to say, did you, this, when  does this come out?  What's that?  The Rolling Stone article.  He's like, yeah, what's that?  I don't know.  This month.  The headline is, Bill Burr's the new Louis C.K.  Damn.  Brutal.  That's great, dude.  That's just, that was embarrassing.  Oh, shit.  I feel bad for Louis.  That was really insulting to him.  I just did, you know, I did Kamau's show last night, the Totally Biased, and they brought 
[02:32:30]  that up, and I kind of broke it down how, like, I put out a special every other year.  Louis does one basically every year, and writes, acts, and directs an arguably the funniest  show on TV.  I couldn't be any further.  It was so insulting to him.  From the new Louis C.K.  Yeah, and they're writing about it like, you know, like he's not at the top of the heap  like he was 10 years ago.  The whole, I'm sure that they meant it in a complimentary way.  Maybe I'm just looking at it in a negative way, but it was just like, yeah, can I just 
[02:33:00]  be Bill Burr?  I would have been happy with dancing clown Bill Burr.  It's still cool as hell, man.  It is cool.  Yes, it is.  It's easier to take a negative comparison and get mad about it than take a positive one  and feel honored.  Like, you know, if they would have said Bill Burr, he's the new, uh, he's the new, uh,  fucking Albert DeSalvo.  What the fuck?  I never killed anybody.  Fuck them.  Yeah.  But it's like, Louis is a great compliment, man.  Yeah.  Bill's also got a take on the pink in the NFL.  I don't have a take.  It's just some stuff I read on the internet that, uh, not a lot of money was, uh. 
[02:33:30]  Not a lot of money's going to the actual cause, right?  A lot of overhead.  A lot of overhead, as they say.  Of course, you know, all the, all the players, uh, wearing pink.  Yeah.  To support breast cancer.  Yeah, and I guess how it works out is it's, it's, they give a percentage of the wholesale  cost of whatever the item costs to make.  Yeah.  So you pay $100 for a jersey, whatever the jersey costs them.  You know, when they say the jersey costs them $10 to make.  And then they give 2% of that, so you're talking like, uh.  So not a lot of money is going to the cost.  10% of it, say, a dollar from it. 
[02:34:00]  And then it goes into the, to the pink lady's place.  And then she's got to get paid and everybody else has to get paid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They make really good salaries.  Yeah.  They get a nice taste when you run a charity.  Yeah, but you know something, this is the deal.  Like, how did you not know it was that?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I just assumed.  Right on.  I mean, I just assumed the second they did, this was the NFL trying to get more female fans.  Whenever you throw cancer into it, do you think people are being legit?  Because, like, who would fuck somebody out of a cancer benefit?  And then they justify it by saying, hey, we're giving something. 
[02:34:30]  What do you, what do you do?  Well, in the end, the number will probably be kind of impressive.  I just would love, they'd just be sitting in some giant house.  It's like, how did you get this?  It's breast cancer.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know.  People really like to give to this horrible disease to cure it.  The misery of other people.  Yeah.  Right.  And I gave myself a raise for running the foundation.  The hopes and dreams of the terminally ill bought me this house.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah, pictures of Bubba Smith, Peter, Chris, Olivia Newton-John, everybody who suffered. 
[02:35:00]  That's your tribute.  Fucking shitheads.  Not them.  This person.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, the big pink movement.  The worst of the week countdown on the Opie and Anthony channel.

This show is replaying all weekend long and it's going to be available on demand, so that's  very exciting.  Number one this week, another cell phone number gets given out on the air. 
[02:40:00]  If you remember about a month ago, Opie accidentally gave out E-Rock's cell phone number.  Well, Lady Di called in to the Opie and Anthony show this week.  You all know who Lady Di is by now, I hope.  If you don't, prepare to meet somebody that you're going to hate.  Lady Di called in and made a bit of a fool of herself.  She tweeted out, what is that, ten digits that probably shouldn't have been tweeted  out.  Because when those digits are combined on a telephone, it reaches her. 
[02:40:30]  Lady Di gave out her cell phone number on Twitter.  But she happened to be on the phone with the Opie and Anthony show at the time.  You don't believe me?  Here it is.  Number one.  Listen, Opie, I heard I got you mad about something.  What happened?  Uh-oh.  What happened?  I'm not mad.  What happened, Opie?  I'm cool these days.  What? 
[02:41:00]  She knows about the direct messaging thing.  What direct message thing?  Well, she, I don't want to.  Oh, Lady Di's been trying to get a hold of me on Twitter, and I wrote her back to tell  her that I'm not getting her tweets.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Well, you see, I'm still new to this Twitter thing.  I think, well, Lady Di, hold on a minute.  This is what you got to do.  You got to.  Di, go ahead.  You got to use capitals when you tweet me, and I'll get that one.  Capital letters?  Yeah, it's a weird thing with Twitter, so if you want to, like, get a hold of me or 
[02:41:30]  Jimmy or Ant in a DM situation, you just fucking use caps.  Well, she found out yesterday that she was DMing Ant, but not you.  Uh-huh.  And Ant was, well, no, Ant was annoyed because she wasn't DMing him, so I told you how to  get Anthony your phone number, and you didn't do it.  Oh, boy.  I didn't like that.  She didn't do it?  I did it.  But as long as you use capital letters, you could use capital letters, and then you could  put your, you know, you could put the number out there. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  You didn't get it.  What you do is you put your number, you write it, but you make it a private message.  You send it out like a regular tweet, but you put two periods after it, and that makes  it a private tweet to the person.  I did that.  No, you didn't.  No, try it right now.  So send me your number.  Try it right now.  Tweet me your number, Lady Di, but remember, put two periods after the number, or else, uh,  Yeah, listen carefully, because you could fuck this up very easily.  Send me your number right now, but put two periods after it so it's just for me.  I'm on the phone. 
[02:42:30]  Well, hold the phone out and open the thing up, your app.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I don't know how to do that.  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Do you have speakerphone?  Fucking drunk.  Do you have speakerphone?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Let me see.  All right.  You're a delight.  Okay.  Colin's going to be doing Unconstitutional up there in New Hampshire, Massachusetts.  It's really good.  Oh, it's amazing.  It's pale to comparison to what's going to happen after, but yes, it is good.  Oh, well, of course. 
[02:43:00]  If Lady Di's on board, well...  Lady Di's on board.  Well, now we've got something going on.  This trip, yeah.  It adds a little something in the mix, a little spice.  Yeah, a little spice.  You know, it sexies it up a little bit.  It sure does.  Lady Di, you there?  Yes, I'm right here.  All right.  All right.  Listen to Anthony.  Did you open up your Twitter?  No, not yet.  I don't know how to do it when I'm on the phone.  Are you on speakerphone?  Yes, I am.  All right.  Now, just...  Do you have an iPhone? 
[02:43:30]  What?  Do you have a jitterbug?  No, I have a smartphone.  No.  All right.  At least the phone is.  God.  What is it called?  You so should have a smartphone.  I have a smartphone.  A dumb lady with a smartphone.  All right.  Go to the main screen, the home screen, while you're on speakerphone.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  The main screen.  Yeah.  How you get into Twitter.  Go to that screen.  Wait a minute.  How do I do that?  You're going to tweet.  Haven't you been tweeting? 
[02:44:00]  You've been tweeting.  No, because she has her phone over.  You have a home button on the phone, the button that takes you to the main page there?  She has a homeless button.  Hold on.  I'm going to press the dial pad.  That might be it.  Okay.  What's going on?  Not the dial pad.  The dial pad.  What's going on?  Oh, my God.  This is.  Wait.  You only know how to tweet from the computer?  Is that what's going on here?  No.  She doesn't know how to open it when the phone's open, because that's taking up her screen.  Got it.  Okay.  I got it.  All right.  Now, open up Twitter. 
[02:44:30]  Okay.  All right.  Yeah?  Now, find me, right?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I'll find you someplace.  Let me see.  God.  Sorry, Carl.  You hope that she figures this out?  No, this is important.  Yes, it is important.  You had some real chemistry going there, and we fucked it up with this phone call.  Sorry.  Lady Di.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I think a lot of people do. 
[02:45:00]  Are you there?  Lady Di.  Okay.  I found you.  All right.  Click on my name, right?  No, she's on your picture.  Well, click on my fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Now, get reply.  You know what...  It's your fault.  I say no now.  I'm telling you.  Send me a tweet.  You got a tweet?  Tweet. 
[02:45:30]  A regular tweet, right?  A regular tweet, right.  Oh.  Sure.  Okay, you ready?  I know.  I don't think I'm good.  You ready?  You did this.  Oh.  I'm sending you a direct message.  No.  It's got to be a tweet.  Yeah, direct message is great.  It's got to be a tweet.  All right.  I don't know.  But it's a private tweet.  It's different than a direct message.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Huh?  I was going to send you a message directly.  No, it's called a private tweet. 
[02:46:00]  I don't accept DMs anymore, so it won't show up.  I only accept private tweets.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  You're making me nervous, man.  Oh, stop it.  Just fucking tweet me.  I'll tell you how to make it private.  What?  Tweet me?  Tweet me.  I don't feel good about this.  Tweet me.  You shouldn't.  Well, where am I going to do...  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Where am I going to do that?  Yeah, where?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Do you know how to tweet? 
[02:46:30]  Do you know how to tweet anybody?  Yes, I do.  So tweet me.  Okay.  He's going to show you a trick.  You ready?  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  We're holding.  Do you got it?  No.  I don't know.  Look, I'm going to tweet you directly because that's the only way I can do it.  There you go.  Tweet me.  Oh, man.  You tweet all the time, you fucking dummy. 
[02:47:00]  God, are you fucking stupid.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Lady Di.  Yes.  What?  Just a regular tweet.  You got it?  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Holy shit.  This is like working with the handicapped.  I'll get it.  I'll get it.  I thought you were trainable.  Yeah.  Right?  How's everything, Di?  Hold on.  Hold on.  How's Marion?  I'm holding on, but it's forever.  How's Marion? 
[02:47:30]  You're infuriating.  Oh, I just found a nice picture of you and Marion.  What do you want to tweet you now?  All right.  Now, do you have it up?  Are you ready to tweet me?  Yeah, but it says Diana.  It says my name, and then it says Anthony Coombe.  Is that right?  That's perfect.  You direct message.  Now, now, send me your phone number, but make sure you put two periods after the phone  number.  Nope.  And then it's called a private tweet.  I'd like.  All right.  Ready? 
[02:48:00]  Send me that, and I'll let you know if I got it right now.  No, no.  See what you did?  No.  All right.  Ready?  No.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  I'm not.  Okay.  You sent it?  All right.  All right.  Now, now I'm tweeting you, okay?  All right.  Go ahead.  Let me see.  This is Jim Norton's doing.  Did you send it?  Yes, it is.  No.  I changed my mind.  No.  You can't.  Did you send it?  Yes, you did.  You sent it. 
[02:48:30]  Maybe I sent it to myself.  There it is.  You got it?  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  There it is.  I got it, Di.  I got it.  Why did you do that, Jim?  Thanks.  Jim, why did you do that?  Jim, did you see this tweet, Jim?  Thank you, Di.  I'll be in touch now about the road trip.  Don't delete your tweet, Di. 
[02:49:00]  Delete your tweet.  Oh, God.  Why?  Jim, we see.  Oh, yeah.  Talk her into deleting a tweet.  That'll take fucking...  Oh, no.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You hear the beeping?  The call?  Can I take it off speakerphone right now?  No, leave speakerphone on.  Yeah.  What's that sound?  Oh, that's people calling me right now, Anthony.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what that beeping sound is. 
[02:49:30]  That's people calling me.  Oh, oh.  This is great.  This is great.  Did you put three periods after the end of the number?  Three periods.  No, it's three periods.  He said it the whole time.  Die.  Everybody's calling.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Die.  You were supposed to put three.  I said three.  Take it down before anybody sees it. 
[02:50:00]  No.  People already saw it, Jim.  No.  Die.  What?  I said three periods.  Am I hearing more beeping?  Just no delay, finally.  So now you really hear it.  Hey, call me right now.  What are you talking about?  Who's calling?  What do you mean? 
[02:50:30]  A job opportunity, maybe.  Yeah, maybe it's somebody with a job.  Maybe it's the Burger King.  It's not Burger King.  I can tell you that right now.  Lady Die, could you do something for us?  Don't erase your messages, because we want to call you later and have you play them back  over the phone for us.  Your voicemails.  Your voicemails.  We'll pay for your vacation.  What?  What's that sound?  Louisiana. 
[02:51:00]  Her tweet has 94 retweets.  I said three periods, Lady Die.  I could have sworn you said two.  Oh, man.  Well, now we understand what's going on.  Oh.  Oh.  Jim, do you feel good about yourself?  No.  You don't?  No.  Oh, no.  I mean, I don't care, but, you know. 
[02:51:30]  Huh?  Well, the phone calls.  Huh?  Oh, wait a minute.  Lady Die.  Lady Die.  I did say two periods.  Okay.  But you put three periods.  Look at your tweet.  You put three periods.  Okay.  Oh, it's supposed to be two.  It was supposed to be two periods. 
[02:52:00]  Delete your tweet, please.  You might want to delete that tweet there.  Yeah, you better delete that tweet, Lady Die.  Because it's an obvious fuck-up.  It's way too late.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I got to go back again.  Yeah, yeah.  Go back.  She's getting a lot of calls.  Do you know how to delete the tweets?  Wait.  Hold on.  Her voicemail box is full.  Hey. 
[02:52:30]  Lady Die?  Lady Die.  Yes, I'm right here.  Do you know how to delete a tweet?  Um.  See, because you better delete that, because your number went out on Twitter, I think.  Yeah, because you messed it up.  Oh, Jesus.  Because you put three periods at the end instead of two, like I told you.  Change the phone number, but let me see.  Her phone number is now part of a lot of other tweets.  Oh, is it? 
[02:53:00]  Who would do that?  All of our listeners.  That sure is a racket going on over there.  You got that right.  Why?  Call back to Twitter.  I think you owe Anthony an apology for fucking it up, man.  Yeah, I told you two periods, and you put three.  Yeah, you probably should apologize to Anthony, because he feels bad about this.  Oh, man. 
[02:53:30]  Oh.  Oh, Lady Die.  Good luck with that.  Oh, you're going to let it go now?  Yeah.  Well, we're going to get the voicemails.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  Hold on the line.  Hold on the line.  Listener treats.  We've got some barbecue.  That's right.  All right.  For Roland's birthday.  That's right.  Big treat for the listeners.  Lady Die, hang on the line.  When we come back, do you know how to access your voicemails on your phone?  Oh, no.  Excuse me.  I'm on hold.  Oh, okay.  Call the wind, Justin Bieber, too.  Bobo. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, I was going to say, if there was going to be an idea with Lady Die, I have a whole  notepad of ideas for the road trip.  What?  What?  Uh-oh.  Right back into this inane idiocy.  Not an ounce of acknowledging what's happening.  Not an ounce of acknowledgement of what just went on.  Right back to this self-centered inane idiocy.  The brilliance of Colin Quinn, he just kept quiet for a couple minutes knowing that all  hell was breaking loose.  And then we go back to Bobo, and not an ounce of knowledge that something just went down. 
[02:54:30]  I have to say, I've never seen someone that didn't have a clue how to use Twitter like  Lady Die.  Exactly.  You get your fucking password hacked every other week.  Yeah, what are you talking about, bobs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't give it out.  Yes, you do.  I don't give it out.  I don't give it out anymore.  Skewdle.  I just saw somebody's phone.  It says, call this number for Obamacare information and hashtag Obamacare. 
[02:55:00]  Hold on.  She's still there.  Die.  Perfect timing.  You can't write better stuff than that.  Die.  Die, is your phone ringing a lot?  Yes, it is.  Oh, my God.  I didn't realize we have so many fans.  We.  We.  Of course, yeah.  Good news, Lady Die. 
[02:55:30]  You're a Twitter phenomenon.  Over 260 retweets on that last tweet of yours.  Amazing.  That is a lot.  We might get you trending today.  So, you know how to play back your voicemails?  Excuse me?  Oh, forget it.  I can't do this.  I can't walk her through a voicemail thing.  Die.  Do you know how to play back your voicemails on speakerphone?  No, I know how to play back.  On speakerphone?  Yes, I do.  All right.  So, you're going to stay where you are.  We're going to take a little break, and then we're going to listen to the voicemails from 
[02:56:00]  the people that are calling you, okay?  I'll do the best I can.  Oh, shit.  That means...  Exactly.  All right.  Don't go anywhere.  And Bobo, any comment?  No, he's gone.  Yes, I have a notebook.  I don't book.  Okay, after all that's happening, not one acknowledgement.  Right back to his fucking self-centered play.  I don't understand how these people become fans of the show.  No.  What do they listen to?  I don't know what they're hearing.  No matter what's happening, in between the fucking planes hitting Tower 1 and 2, I get  a notebook, dude, I wouldn't be disgusted. 
[02:56:30]  All right, Colin.  Thank you so much, sir.  See you later.  All right.  See you, Colin.  Take it easy, Colin.  Jesus.  Oh, I love it.  That's the best you got from us.

[03:01:00]  Friends of the Show.  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the Opie and Anthony  show.  This week, Tom Papa's Sirius XM show, Come to Papa.  Hello, everyone, and welcome to another live edition of Come to Papa.  Now, let's give a warm welcome to your host.  He's got the voice of an angel and the head of a dolphin, Tom Papa. 
[03:01:30]  Tom Papa.  Hello, everybody.  Thank you for coming out tonight.  Welcome to the show.  I am Tom Papa, and we're broadcasting once again from the Village Underground Nightclub  in New York City, where a studio apartment will cost you $2,000 a month, but you can still  eat a hot dog and watch a juggling hermaphrodite for a dollar.  Thank you all for listening out there, and thank all of you who came out to join us live. 
[03:02:00]  Our audience for the show, the audiences for this show, are truly the best in the city.  They get better every time.  And by best, I mean they laugh hard, they tip big, and they smell like baby angel arms.  Now, please say hello to the best announcer in the business, the one and only, Rick Crome,  everybody.  Thanks, Tom.  Tonight's show is being brought to you by Carl's Vegan Corned Beef Sandwiches. 
[03:02:30]  They look like corned beef, smell like corned beef, and taste like paint peeled off a port-a-potty.  Carl's Vegan Corned Beef Sandwiches.  Yuck!  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our amazing band made up of the greatest jazz musicians  and part-time pimps in the country, Elio and the Come to Papa Trio. 
[03:03:00]  I love the band.  They make great music and even better pot brownies.  And they sell them after the show.  You know, comedians and musicians get along because we share a lot of the same traits.  Comedians and musicians both love what we do, we both keep odd hours, and we all try and  sleep with the same waitresses.  So I thought tonight's show would celebrate jazz.  Give us a little, boys.  Very jazzy. 
[03:03:30]  Many say that comedy and jazz are the true, only true, American art forms.  They're both born out of the American way of life.  They both encourage freedom and improvisation.  They're both the way for true degenerates who have no other skills.  To somehow make a living. 
[03:04:00]  Jazz started in the late 1800s, beginning as ragtime.  Eventually mixing with the blues and giving birth to a new sound.  A new reflection of the country.  A new thing to smoke tons of weed to.  Jazz influenced everything we listen to today.  And it all started through the pioneering of great artists.  From Joe King Oliver to Louis Armstrong. 
[03:04:30]  Count Basie and Duke Ellington.  Ella Fitzgerald.  Billie Holiday.  Miles Davis.  Charlie Parker.  Thelonious Monk.  And maybe one or two white guys.  In many ways, jazz began as the sound of the African American community.  In many ways, jazz began as the sound of the African American community. 
[03:05:00]  Jazz started as the sound of the African American community.  Wrong!  African Americans and Creoles began playing together down in New Orleans.  Bullshit!  What do you mean, bullshit?  Everybody knows jazz started in Bricktown, New Jersey.  In my mom's basement. 
[03:05:30]  I'm sorry, who are you two?  Everyone knows us, Mac.  We're America's first jazz band.  I'm Skeeter McGee.  And I'm Applejack Johnson.  And together, we're the Originals.  Alright, well what's the name of your band?  We just told you, bub.  We are the Originals.  The Original what?  Is he fucking with me?  I swear to God, I will stick a saxophone through this guy's larynx right now.  Simmer down, Applejack.  We don't need another untalented dead radio show host on our hand. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, the Originals.  I'm sorry, I just never heard of you guys.  That's because we were robbed, chum.  Another example of black people stealing from the white man.  So you say that you started jazz.  That's right, shit lip.  Not only did we discover the music, we even came up with the name.  Jazz.  Yeah, nobody ever thought to even put two Z's together until we did it.  Now they all do it. 
[03:06:30]  What about fizz or fuzz?  Holy Skeeter, I am about to shit hammer a drumstick through this guy's eyeball right now.  Pay attention, funny guy.  He'll do it.  One time old Applejack here bludgeoned the entire Count Basie orchestra and ate the genitals of the horn section.  Count Basie don't want a piece of me.  Now wait a minute.  You seriously say you started jazz.  Yeah, that's right.  We wrote all that stuff and they stole it. 
[03:07:00]  What were some of the songs they allegedly stole from you?  We'll show you, peepers.  Hit it, Applejack.  A one, two, a one, two, three, four.  Well?  Yeah, that's it.  That was ours.  Overnight, everyone's doing it.  You walk into a club and there's a one, a two, a one, two, three.  That's counting off.  Everybody counts off.  No, they do it now after we did it. 
[03:07:30]  Seriously, jazz came out of the struggle of the black culture in America.  They don't struggle.  Yeah, we struggle.  You know how hard it is to start a band with no rhythm, timing, or talent whatsoever?  I can't even tap my foot without falling on my ass.  My flat, beautiful, porcelain ass. 
[03:08:00]  But wait a minute.  What about early jazz greats?  What about Louis Armstrong?  Pack.  Old fish lips stole everything from Skeeter here.  You play the trumpet, Skeeter?  No, I don't.  But I was the first guy to show up on the scene with a legitimate fish face.  That's how you know Armstrong's a fraud.  He's like a normal guy.  And then he gets all puffy like a fish for a minute.  But Skeeter's all fish all the time.  Look at him.  Fish face, fish body. 
[03:08:30]  I'm telling you, I bunk with this guy.  He leaves a trail of slime like a mollusk.  That's absolutely true.  Thanks, Applejack.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Now hold up.  Hold the hell up.  I'm not listening to this bullshit.  Yeah.  I'm tired of this shit.  Yeah.  Everybody knows this is our music.  Yeah.  Huh?  The black man's music.  Yeah, black man.  You're damn right.  Thank you, brother.  Yeah.  Read.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Huh?  We did the blues.  They stole it.  We did jazz.  They tried to take that dude.  They still try to take dancing.  But we know how that worked out.  VMA's twerking.  Yeah, twerking.  Who are you?  I'm jazz great, baby.  Yeah.  Fats Waller.  Get your ass.  Fats.  Well, you got that part right. 
[03:09:30]  We had your own fatso in your belly button.  Oh, shit.  These guys are frauds.  Huh?  They shouldn't be called no damn the originals.  Hell no.  They should be called the unoriginal originals.  Yeah.  Huh?  In your ass.  What kind of trio only has two guys in it?  Yeah, only two.  You only need two.  You don't need a drum and a bass.  They're shit.  They sound exactly the same. 
[03:10:00]  No offense.  Oh.  The bassist doesn't like that.  If these guys created jazz, why the hell are all the great jazz musicians from Harlem and New Orleans?  Yeah, why?  Because no one would come to my mom's house.  We tried.  Okay?  We made snacks.  My sister broke off free handos, but no one came.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  It's not our fault Applejack's sister has a vagina that smells like a McDonald's dumpster.  So wait a minute.  You can't play instruments.  You have no rhythm.  No one came to any of your shows.  I think Fats is right.  You guys are frauds.  All right.  Fine.  Okay.  Mr. Detective, maybe we didn't invent jazz, but we invented soul music.  No, you didn't. 
[03:11:00]  How about the blues?  Nope.  Hippity hop?  Get the fuck out of here.  All right.  Fine.  But we NASCAR, fencing quiche, that's us.  You can really have that shit.  That was the amazing Jim Norton, Kurt Metzger, Keith Robinson, and Godfrey, everybody.  That sketch was brought to you by Frank's frozen goldfish. 
[03:11:30]  Has your child's pet just died?  Has your child's pet just died?  Are you in for days of crying?  Not if you have Frank's frozen goldfish.  Pop one out, plop it into a bowl, and presto.  Your kid has a new friend.  Also, try our new frozen puppies.  They're not much fun, but they look just like the real thing.  Frank's frozen goldfish. 
[03:12:00]  Quit your crying, you big baby.  One more time for Jim Norton and Keith Robinson, Godfrey, and Kurt Metzger.  That's the one thing I like about doing the show.  No matter how dirty I write it, I give it to Jim Norton.  It ends up dirtier.  Say, Rick, are you a fan of jazz?  Am I a fan?  I'm a jazz yodeler.  What does that mean?  Well, you're familiar with yodeling. 
[03:12:30]  And you're familiar with jazz singing.  Well, I do both.  What do you mean?  At the same time.  Scat yodeling.  Are you serious?  Yes, indeed.  All right, give me a little.  Oh, all right.  You there?  Here we go.  In other words, I love you. 
[03:13:00]  I didn't think there was any chance I was going to like that.  Rick Crome, everybody.  Thank you.  You know, as we celebrate jazz tonight, one name always rises to the top for musicians  and audiences alike, whenever you talk about jazz. 
[03:13:30]  The great Louis Armstrong.  Yeah.  Woo!  He transcends popular culture, popular music, and was able to speak to the entire world  in a way that can only be described as spiritual.  If only there was a way to have Louis back here with us today,  would be...  Oh, what's happening?  Hey, everybody. 
[03:14:00]  Hey, it's Louis Armstrong, everybody.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Aren't I the most beautiful thing you ever did see?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's really great to have you here, Louis.  Baby-dee-bop-dee-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop-zop.  Yes, it is.  Yes.  Yes.  It is.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:14:30]  There's so much I want to ask you.  Well, don't.  Baby-dee-bop.  Yeah.  People always ask me, what inspires me as a musician?  So I'm going to tell you while I play my horn.  Would you love that, everybody?  Yeah.  Oh yeah, I love life, I love women, I love red wine, and I love jazz all the time. 
[03:15:00]  I love children laughing, I love all kinds of weather, I love to tickle my balls with  a long peacock feather, yeah, coochie coo balls, yeah, I love trees, I love little frogs with 
[03:15:30]  the big red eyes, I love getting naked on the subway and pretending to fly, this train's  going express, yeah, I love leather shoes, I love outer space, I love dressing my cat  up like Hitler and throwing water balloons at his dumb cat face, yeah, meow, I love baseball,  I love apple pie, and I love giving naked old ladies piggyback rides, yeah, oink oink, yeah, 
[03:16:00]  I love bright orange leaves, I love new falling snow, hold on, I love the paper stuck, you  understand, hmm, it was coming from my heart, but your shit was sticky, hmm, I love smoking 
[03:16:30]  bong hits and putting powder up my nose, oh yeah, zippy-da-ba-dee-da-ba-dee, but most of all,  ever since I was born, there's nothing I like more than the audience and my horn, I love my  horn, yeah, thank you everybody, what a wonderful world.  The great Louis Armstrong, played by God for everybody. 
[03:17:00]  So weird that sometimes he was able to talk and play the horn at the same time.  Lou Soloff, everybody, the great Lou Soloff, one of the best trumpet players in the entire  country, why don't you guys play a little while we got Lou up here.  Lou Soloff, one of the best trumpet players in the entire country.  Why don't you guys play a little while we got Lou up here.  In that number, oh, when the saints come marching in, yeah.

[03:22:30]  and now for a social commentary on jazz and what it means to america we are lucky to bring to the  stage from 60 minutes the late great andy rooney  have you ever put on a jazz record and in the middle of a long trumpet solo wanted to stab your  own eye out with a chopstick i have why do they always repeat the same note over and over again 
[03:23:00]  do they think we didn't hear it the first 20 times someone needs to punch the horn player in the mouth  have you ever gone to a jazz club and realized you're the only white guy in the place  i have lucky for me that black people dig me  i think my old skin reminds them of old overcooked cornbread  what is cornbread anyway it's not bread it's more like a block of orange cake 
[03:23:30]  have you ever fallen asleep with cake in your mouth and woke up the next morning covered in your own  vomit i have it made me feel like a rock star isn't that how jimmy hendrix died i can't remember if  he threw up in his bed or was shot by a guitar hating midget  have you ever taken pictures of midgets on your cell phone like you were catching them for good luck 
[03:24:00]  i have  they look funny but they really have magical powers  but if you try and take a picture of them don't let them catch you in the act  there's nothing worse than being attacked by a gaggle of little people in the middle of the mall  i knew midgets were fast i didn't know like they i didn't know they like to run in packs  you don't notice it at first but whenever you see a little fella take a look around there's never

[03:41:00]  dollars which is a lot of money it was eight dollars they're now thirteen fucking dollars from  eight to thirteen right and like you go through the tunnel they don't wash your car no they they  raise their price over fifty percent over no other business on this planet could raise their price  over fifty percent and stay in business that would be impossible right like what's your name 
[03:41:30]  nick nick say where you get your haircut just say they raise the price to six dollars right  you're like  bullshit you know what i'm saying  thirteen goddamn dollars  uh this week was the second year anniversary anniversary for occupy wall street uh  uh those guys who accomplished nothing 
[03:42:00]  because it wasn't really a protest because it had no demands it was more of a camping trip  because you don't have any fucking demands it's not a watch any prison uprising documentary  it's about fucking demands prisoners know how to make demands like we're going to kill all the guards  unless we get candy corn okay  that's just something you know anything it's for the holiday  these kids don't like the banks who likes it not one person in here has a bank of america tattoo 
[03:42:30]  okay nobody i was in bank of america right i went to deposit a check deposit a check  and they asked me for id i go are you telling me other people are trying to put money in my account  and you're telling them no  on me it's me  so i made a large deposit so the supervisor came up to me and said i have good news for you 
[03:43:00]  i said did israel attack iran  she said no i said was my wife hit by a bus  i go what's the good news cookie because i made a large deposit that's what i called her  so what do you got toots  what's a skirt like you got to tell me  bring it on dame that's what i said 
[03:43:30]  she said after this deposit you are now a platinum member at bank of america and i'm not trying to  talk down to you guys even though i'm at a whole nother level just how it is  i said what is that in title she said we raise your interest rate i said to what and she started  off with point so i could have came back a year later and it still wouldn't have hit one percent  you get what i'm saying because once i start off with point it's always going to be under one 
[03:44:00]  percent and and i quit school and i know that she said your interest rate now is point forty five  percent i go to the platinum members get towels because i just came all over my leg okay  is there a platinum member come cleaner  point forty five when my six-year-old is born i put five thousand dollars into her college fund

[03:45:30]  all right speaking of sex here's the deal are you here with your mom that's got to be a fun night  out huh what do you think you and mom are going to do after this maybe go out for a float a little  ice cream float or something  you ever walk in on mom and dad when you were a kid  she's wearing a leather mask he's in an ss uniform 
[03:46:00]  are you from out of town where jersey yeah big trip  13 fucking dollars what part of jersey north jersey do you have any idea what city you  fucking live in stupid  yeah i live above somerville i'm done with you  how old are you you're cute man don't ever go to prison you are worth a carnage cigarettes and a snickers bar 
[03:46:30]  here's the deal when it comes to sex  we've all done some weird shit we've all you just got to know where to draw the line there's a personal  line and then there's like a line that nobody's supposed to cross like your line and this  fucking line you know what i'm saying look there's dudes that like rubber balls in their mouth you know 
[03:47:00]  with leather as llamas are pissing on them you know what i'm saying and that's okay as long as that's  where the llama stops you see what i'm saying you got to know where to draw look every now and then  everybody likes a little something in their ass you know what i'm saying a finger a pencil like during  a birthday or an anniversary i'm not talking to peanut butter jars there's something to make you aware  of who's behind you in bed like oh i forgot it was my birthday yeah okay i saw i read on the internet 
[03:47:30]  this is true this guy put a live eel in his ass that's crossing the major line for real he put  a large a live eel in his ass and it got wedged or lodged up into his ass and he had to go to the  hospital which of course he would because nobody wants to walk around the rest of their life with  their ass a little flapping he had to go to a hospital with the eel lodged in his head which had 
[03:48:00]  to be really embarrassing and i'm thinking if that was me before i went to the hospital i would have  to break my wrist first and when i got to the hospital i go look while i'm here  can you check to see if there's a live eel in my ass  i mean the main reason i'm here obviously is because of my wrist 
[03:48:30]  but i figure since you have the x-ray machine going let's kill two birds with one stone  what happened was i was at work a new job  i'm i'm in my cubicle on a computer and i'm thinking did did did a live eel  did a live eel just grow my ass 
[03:49:00]  there's more to that bit but they're giving me the light so i'm gonna do another one  but that was good enough for that bit stop stop i i'm not like keith i don't give a  fuck okay he's out drinking somewhere you're kind of good looking you married i got a car  see i don't know what how long ago did i do this show like three months ago  i don't even know what bits i did then i know i didn't do the eel bit then because that's did i no 
[03:49:30]  i'm gonna do the uh the other bit i think i did it i don't know do they play this on the radio  i don't care what the fuck do i care listen to me here's the deal is this your girlfriend  it's your wife all right here's the deal she'll never leave you listen to me okay  focus okay when you were a kid and other kids were burning ants with magnifying glasses did you just  push them out of the way and go  fucking gargoyle eyes listen to me listen to me i'm just asking don't worry just everybody has

[03:50:30]  anyhow here's the deal i could do i got recovery i got hours of shit i'm a big fucking act uh  i really am i'm fucking big uh  she's never gonna leave you because i could you have kind of a little bit of low self-esteem  just by the way you're slouched uh and most guys do most guys think my girl's gonna leave me  it's never gonna fucking happen i don't care if she's a supermodel right all you have to do is find 
[03:51:00]  her weakness her insecurity then you fucking swoop in and take advantage of it say you're with a girl  and she thinks her hand is just a little too big you have to really make her believe  bitch you got the biggest hand on the planet you're lucky i'm fucking you with that frying pan hand  nobody else is gonna fuck you with that hand but i love you for who you are  although you did to see me when i first met you and you wave with your good hand
