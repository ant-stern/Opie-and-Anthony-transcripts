<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a listener, Sam, detailing his impressive family tree, connecting him to historical figures like Thomas Jefferson and Miles Standish. This led to a gruesome discussion of William the Conqueror's death, focusing on the graphic details surrounding his swollen abscess and the theft of his clothes by a servant.  The show then welcomed Chris and Frankie D. from Long Island, who presented gifts: a Nirvana poster for Opie, a Jack Nicholson photo for Anthony, and a Kiss lunchbox for Jimmy, which Jimmy promptly broke, resulting in comedic frustration.  Chris also gifted Steve various flame-themed items.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  The hosts played listener-created remixes, alongside explicit descriptions of the tapes' content, including graphic sexual acts, insults, and allegations of O'Brien using racial slurs and attempting to hit on Oprah Winfrey.  This transitioned into a discussion of Jim Norton's encounter with Natalia, an escort from NY Confidential, arranged by the owner, Jason. Norton detailed the sexual encounter, including specific acts and location, while discussing Jason's arrest, Natalia's media appearances (including a New York Magazine cover), the possibility of hidden cameras, and concerns about sexually transmitted diseases, specifically AIDS.  The segment included listener calls, a "wow sticker" promotion discussion, and audio clips from the hosts' Ozzfest interviews, including interviews with Bill Burr.  The segment concluded with a recounting of Steve's particularly foul-smelling bowel movement in the studio bathroom.

A lengthy, rambling interview with Jim Norton followed, heavily focused on a poorly-remembered anecdote about a dress in Philadelphia, frequently interrupted and altered by the hosts.  This was followed by an in-studio interview with Zakk Wylde of Black Sabbath, who provided vague responses regarding the dress incident, fueled by a story from someone named Kim. Listener calls from John and Byron commented on the interview's absurdity.  More Ozzfest coverage followed, including interviews with A Dozen Furies, Shadows Fall, In Flames, and a humorous "Drown the Clown" act.  A significant portion was dedicated to an interview with Bill Ward of Black Sabbath, marked by Norton's overwhelmingly enthusiastic fanboy behavior.

Jimmy's Ozzfest interviews, particularly with Bill Ward, were discussed extensively, including Jimmy's surprisingly accurate recall of the *Master of Reality* release year (1974).  The segment featured listener calls sharing similar fan experiences and a clip of Bill Ward calling back to correct a minor detail. A negative *New York Post* review of Black Sabbath's Ozzfest performance by Dan Aquilante prompted a highly offensive, angry response from Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, involving accusations of bias and a debate on the nature of unbiased reviews.  The discussion included further anecdotes about meeting celebrities, medical procedures, gambling, and political viewpoints, with Brother Wease present in the studio.

Another segment involved a comedian (likely Brother Wease) discussing perceived double standards in Comedy Central's content restrictions, particularly concerning race and the use of the n-word, contrasting this with the perceived leniency towards left-leaning comedians, and criticizing Margaret Cho's perceived smugness.  Anthony Cumia detailed his battle with cancer, including treatments, weight loss, and financial difficulties.  The show then shifted to a detailed, offensive critique of racial stereotypes in *Good Times*, using the n-word frequently while dissecting plotlines and characters.  A call-in segment and a phone interview with Bill Burr followed, covering his career, experiences with difficult audiences, and views on political correctness.  An in-studio interview with Mudvayne concluded this segment, covering their touring experiences, fan interactions, and their time at Ozzfest. A short comedic bit from the show's archive played at the end.

An in-studio interview with Mudvayne followed, discussing their musical evolution, fan reactions, the origin of their name (a carp-fishing anecdote), and online fan communities.  A caller mentioned their alleged refusal to take pictures with fans, which the band clarified as a measure against stalking. Comedian Jay Moore then joined, contributing off-color jokes and anecdotes, including a story involving nudity and his living situation with Nicky Cox.  A new segment, "Bombs and Flubs," showcasing previous show bloopers and failed jokes with offensive language, concluded this portion.

The final segment featured a bit comparing a caller's highly profane rant against Jim Norton with cleaned-up versions for television, involving creative rewrites by Steve, replete with bodily function and sexual references.  It included discussion of Norton's upcoming State Theater appearance and a contrasting interview he conducted with D.C.'s "The Arrow" radio station.  The hosts promoted their XM radio show and their return after a break, with a call from Vic expressing appreciation for the bit.  The segment concluded with brief mention of Eric Nagel and an upcoming HBO project.

[00:10:30]  talking about, you know, bringing some Thomas Jefferson stuff or something.  So that day, he went through the book and actually typed that out, and then...  Yeah, but it's confusing.  I know, that's why I had to make the notes on it, because...  Now, I'm looking at this.  Is this, because I see mother of, father of, blah, blah, blah, in the first column. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  But then there's none of that here in the second column, where Thomas Jefferson is.  Right, the second column is, the second, third, fourth columns are extended generation.  It seems to split after Peter Field Jefferson on both of those, and then goes to John Robert Jefferson.  So is this like maybe one side of the family, and then the other side?  This is all my dad's side. 
[00:11:30]  This is all your dad's side.  And so, Thomas Jefferson II is right there.  This is just the mother and father of...  So Thomas Jefferson II would be the grandfather, making the president, Thomas Jefferson, the first cousin.  The great, great, great, great, great, great first cousin.  I'll say he is.  Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, is number 13.  That's pretty cool. 
[00:12:00]  And now Miles Standish, this looks like a pretty straightforward family tree thing here.  Right, he would be the grandfather, the great, great, great, great, great, great, great.  So now Miles Standish is the father of Josius Standish, is that what I'm...  Yeah, that's what it looks like.  And then that's the father of Mercy Standish, the father of Mary Well, Wheelock.  Yes.  Wheelock.  They had great names back then.  What is your last name?  I don't know, looks at a wheel lock, wheel lock. 
[00:12:30]  You just pick them.  And then that, that, that, and then it goes to your father and you.  Right.  Wow.  That's pretty impressive.  That's it.  That's the way the tree...  And I feel bad that you're getting our stuff for us.  Really?  They were looking for black blood in there somewhere.  And my mom was, because it's not there, you know, because Thomas Jefferson is a cousin, so it's not, his blood is not.  So my mom was trying to go through her family tree, but my mom's family gets a little shady at points, so they can't exactly trace back. 
[00:13:00]  There's a lot of shade on her side.  They can't trace it all the way back terribly far.  Well, that's why I'm amazed that you get this far back with a family tree, because I know I could probably go back to my great-grandfather, and then it would just get lost in some vendetta somewhere in Sicily.  It gets really shady after those trips to Oakland.  That's very cool, Sam.  But yeah, that's the tree.  Do you have any memorabilia from these people? 
[00:13:30]  No, I mean, there's got to be something somewhere in the family.  William the Conqueror's sword or something?  Wouldn't that be cool?  If I can find anything at all, I will absolutely bring it in.  Do you see any paintings of William the Conqueror?  What did he look like?  Was he a big fella?  I have no clue.  My dad handed me that, and he's like, yeah.  I would so be researching William the Conqueror.  Died in 1087.  What did he do?  What did he conquer?  Well, Bill, he was better known as Duke of Normandy. 
[00:14:00]  Is that it?  He was William the Bastard.  His rule was stern.  Ah, tell him, Fred.  My rule was stern.  It's faced with many battles.  The most famous was October 14th, 1066.  He led the Normans to defeat the English forces in the celebrated Battle of Hastings.  Wow.  On Christmas Day, he was crowned the King of England in the famed Westminster Abbey.  Wow.  This guy was like the real deal. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  An OG.  Are you allowed to just...  Like a real OG.  Are you allowed to just go to the Westminster Abbey and say, hey, I'm related to the dude?  You know, I've never tried, but I've got to assume, yeah, I'll just bring the tree.  That little printout.  That would be, like, pretty good.  You're royalty.  I, um, fast forward 1,000 years.  Who was, who was, uh, this young Sam the intern?  Oh, this is...  Oh, this is here.  He would get muffins and coffee for a man with...  How do you do?  I'm Sam. 
[00:15:00]  This is pretty, uh, rude.  The twisted part of William the Conqueror's death.  He died September 9th, 1087, at the age of 60 years old.  Within minutes, the servant stole everything from his residence, including his clothes, and left his swollen, lifeless body naked on the floor.  That's where you get the black in his hand, buddy.  Oh!  There.  There you go.  There's your proof, buddy. 
[00:15:30]  An obscure knight named Herloon was the first to discover William's nude body.  At his own expense, it was not a wealthy man.  He arranged for the body to be prepared for the funeral and transported to Cain.  Just before the solemn funeral procession reached the church, the cries of fire were heard.  The mourners were forced to put his coffin down and go fight a fire.  Eventually, they put the fire out, returned to the body, and continued along its way to the church.  The funeral was held on a blisteringly hot day.  As a result, his abscess had swelled and became putrid. 
[00:16:00]  When they tried to fit William's body into a custom-made sarcophagus, they found out it had swelled so much it wouldn't fit in.  What to do?  They squeezed him in.  They tried to push him to no avail.  Then they pushed his swollen abdominal wall, and William the Conqueror's body burst like a popped balloon.  The pus and putrefaction drenched the king's burial garb.  The stench filled the chapel. 
[00:16:30]  The mourners raced for the door, their hands covering their noses.  Needless to say, they buried him very quickly.  That's Grandpa.  Yeah, that's it.  He said, what happened was he got thrown a horse through him onto the saddle's iron pommel, which is that big knob on the front.  Ooh.  And his injuries were internal.  The saddle burst his intestines, and waste matter began to fill and poison his intestines.  Is that what happens?  Yeah, no, I was riding, and the horn of the saddle went up my ass. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, I swear, I was on a horse.  You go to the doctor with the saddle up your ass.  Pantitis.  Hmm.  Well, very good, Sam.  He couldn't fix that, I guess, back then.  There was no surgery.  He was constantly ridiculed for being a fat man.  Huh.  You're a skinny guy.  Sure am.  That's right.  I'll take after William the Conqueror.  No, sir.  So you think when the servants kind of raided the place, there's that one relative who was slow,  and then there was Kathy with a limp.  Aha!  I see where the tree split. 
[00:17:30]  Wow, that's some family trick.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  No, I'm not in a rush or anything.  Hey, guys, next one.  Guy brings gifts.  Fan brought, like, a really weird Nirvana poster for Opie and a signed picture of Jack for Ant,  and a kiss lunchbox for me.  Guys, it just gets crazy.  Listen.  Well, yeah, all right.  I guess that's a good way to intro.  All you need.  He's absolutely right.  Jimmy loses his mind.  Oh, I lost my fucking mind.  Dude, take a listen.  Pew!  It's the worst. 
[00:18:00]  I'll be an Anthony.  Now, there's a boy out here who brought you a gift.  What?  A slender boy.  Oh, a gift for everybody.  All right, why don't we take care of this?  Bring this slender boy in.  Yeah, let's take care of all the people out there.  Hawk, take care of it.  More faithful listeners stopping by today.  I hope it's not Buddy Hinton.  Hoping for our appreciation.  Here they come.  Buddy Hinton.  Might be a fight out there.  Buddy Hinton, huh?  Wow.  Love that episode.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  I'm surprised that he can walk. 
[00:18:30]  You got a flame shirt on.  I know it's right away.  Whoa.  What's your name?  I'm Chris.  Hey, Chris, from where?  Deer Park.  Deer Park, Long Island.  Deer Park.  In my house.  Very nice.  Representing.  And who are you?  Frankie D.  Frankie D.  Frankie D.  Where are you from?  West Babylon.  West Babylon.  Where?  West Babylon.  Oh, sorry.  Is that an official Opie and Anthony Spread the Virus t-shirt?  Yes, sir.  Look at that.  Spend a lot of time with your muscle cars out there on Deer Park Avenue?  Yes.  Yes, you do?  Still do.  You have a lot of drag racing down there?  Yes, I do.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  Babylon Speedway, motherfuckers.  What the fuck?  Back when I was in high school.  Shh.  They're cranking down on that shit.  Yeah.  It's been going on for how many years there?  Crank it down.  Yeah, I crank it down.  It's been 20, how long have they been doing it?  They're 30 years?  Yeah.  Something like that.  All right.  So what did you guys bring us today?  Well, actually, I supply Steve with flame stuff.  You do?  So I'm really here to give Steve a bunch of flame stuff, but I figured since I was coming  that I would, I have a ton of stuff.  So I brought you something, I brought you something, I brought you something, nothing flame 
[00:19:30]  related.  Oh, very good.  I was going to say, if it's flaming, you might as well really light it on fire.  This is for you.  I want to be wearing.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  And it's a big frame, something framed, it's wrapped.  This is for you.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Uh-oh, they're getting smaller as we go.  They're getting smaller and little Jimmy.  Jim.  Oh, look, a cigarette lighter wrapped up.  What I was trying to do for you was a friend of mine actually has a first print Black Sabbath 
[00:20:00]  with, uh, first print Black Sabbath's first album with all four signatures.  I was trying to get it off him for you, but I'd give you something out of my personal  collection.  Wow, thank you.  That's the originals.  You know how bad I wanted to smash his gift and I can't?  Wow, that's original, dude.  This is really cool.  That's original.  A Nirvana poster.  That's right off the wall inside of that gig.  Nirvana in utero, July 23rd, 1993.  New music seminar, Roseland, New York City.  I will hang this in my apartment, sir. 
[00:20:30]  This is authentic.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, it is.  It's sandwiched in between the backing and the picture is the certificate of authenticity.  Come on.  Wait, what is it?  It's an autographed Nicholson picture.  Him sitting at the bar in The Shining.  That's great.  That's great.  Well, thank you, sir.  I got a kiss lunchbox.  When was this made?  This is brand new.  Actually, it's about three years old.  It was a gift to me. 
[00:21:00]  All this stuff was a gift to me.  So, I just have way too much stuff.  He's looking at our great things and he has a lunchbox.  I was trying for the album.  I was trying to get him the album.  No, no, that's cool when you see two good gifts.  You'd love to hear about what you almost got.  Autographed Jack Nicholson picture.  A nice Nirvana poster frame.  I pulled that right off of my shelf because the album fell through.  No, no, that's cool.  No, don't say it's cool.  What's inside, Jimmy?  Maybe something's inside.  There's whiteness. 
[00:21:30]  There's no thermos?  No thermos.  See, now, a lot of times, like these lunchboxes, there's actually a big thing for these, like  a lot of these vintage lunchboxes, which would be awful.  You want a brand new one.  So, if you save that, though, for like 50 years, just think about it.  Look at his face.  It's terrific.  I'm disappointed.  No, no.  I'm disappointed.  I'm surprised it doesn't have XM on it and you can sit on it and spoil it.  I was just going to say, Anthony was less disappointed with the knee pad thing there. 
[00:22:00]  No, that's a cool gift.  It's good.  Carried up.  It's a lunch right in there.  Would you rather have the flaming sneakers or the tattooed flaming shirt?  No, no, no.  That's all right.  This is terrific.  Listen to it tinkle.  There's a lot of fun to be had with that one.  The sound of a good lunchbox.  How's that original poster over there doing?  It rocks.  I'm very happy with my gift.  There you go.  Thanks.  There you go.  You want to see the Nicholson?  No, don't give it to him.  I wouldn't break it.  He's not going to break it.  He's not you.  All right.  Look at that.  Jimmy, there is a hammer and a mallet in front of you, just in case. 
[00:22:30]  Jack Nicholson from The Shining, a film that apparently only Anthony quotes.  Why would Jimmy like a Jack Nicholson signed picture?  I only had one of those.  Yeah, no, there's probably only one in existence, but I'll bet there's a lot of these.  Jimmy, why don't you show your appreciation for the gift?  I actually, I don't mind this gift.  When I first saw the kiss, the kiss thing, oh, look, what happened to it? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, the latch broke?  No, no, no.  It will be soon.  When I first saw the, this is for any kiss fans out there, it's Ray's Faces from the  Originals, which is a compilation album of their first three, which is Kiss, Dressed  to Kill, and Hotter Than Hell, all put into one called The Originals.  And I saw that, and I'm like, wow, this has got to be old.  But then I looked at it, and I realized it's in perfect condition.  And it's got a plastic molded handle that...  And it says Made in China on the bottom in a perfectly brand new sticker. 
[00:23:30]  I mean, I like this.  Don't get me wrong.  It's actually really a nice gift.  I mean, I was really...  I mean, you look at how the faces are kind of like swollen.  Oh, God!  He's ripping me off.  Hoo-hoo.  Jimmy!  Tell him, Fred.  That is a...  It's a nice gift.  I dropped it.  I'd like to have another one.  Maybe if anybody else has...  You know, he has Toys R Us on their way over.  Here's the real gift.  I brought that to you there.  Oh.  Oh, he's unzipping his pants. 
[00:24:00]  I've got to be honest.  I don't know which of these I'd choose.  Now open it.  Oh, there you go.  There we are.  It works.  Let's sign that in.  Put it up on eBay.  Oh, there you go.  I'll just buy it and break it again.  How's that vintage and rare signed picture of Nicholson?  That is wonderful.  It's Jack sitting at the bar in The Shining.  All kidding aside, this is going to drive him nuts.  No.  Not at all.  An autograph of Jack?  No, no.  Who'd want that? 
[00:24:30]  Who'd want that?  You know.  I mean, he never really comes up on the show.  No.  And, you know, a band you love, an original gig poster that's ungettable.  I mean, yuck.  I like something that you can go out and just grab and any Toys R Us on the way over.  Would you have rather I brought nothing?  Shut your face.  What do you mean, would I have rather you brought nothing?  You did.  All right.  To tell you the truth, I thought the sound of the album was in the bag.  And that was grabbed off my cell.  Oh, man. 
[00:25:00]  He was going to get you something great.  I was working on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy.  I didn't want to come with nothing.  But I'm glad you smashed it.  No, I didn't mean to smash it.  No.  I mean, it slipped.  I actually got scared.  I was frightened.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to sign the broken kiss.  You want to see Steve's stuff?  Yeah, let's see the flaming stuff.  Sure.  Let's see what Steve got before we go to break here.  It's printing money.  This is a...  Oh, wow.  Tattoo.  Flaming tattoo guns.  Look at that flaming tattoo and beautiful black and burgundy. 
[00:25:30]  Very nice.  Flaming vans.  Look, Steve.  It's like Christmas in here today.  It really is.  Chris sent me a box of...  Eric, here.  Just take this.  The first...  Oh, I've got no mic.  What is that, bro?  It's a face wrap.  It's like a ski face wrap for the winter.  Oh, for when Steve goes skiing.  Yeah.  Oh, just walking through the city.  I got one.  I used to when I walked through the city.  Cool gift in August.  For Steve. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  That's good.  I am speechless.  Now, sit on and try to go through the subway turnstile.  Wow.  There's a...  There's a terrorist with perfect diction.  I'm just going to blur everybody up.  Hey, could you just sew five of those together in case Ben gets cold?  Don't agree with your country's policies.  Look at Steve.  You tend to always side with Israel, and a lot of times my people.  Jimmy, look.  Looks like he's done that before.  Jesus.  He certainly has.  Oh, my God.  Does it look like he's just going to anally rape somebody? 
[00:26:30]  Looks like he has put on masks before.  That's it.  Wow.  Can you stand outside of a schoolyard now with an erection?  Steve, what did I say?  Sorry.  No, this is great stuff.  Yeah.  This is really...  I got my bagel.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, you got my bagel.  Oh, it looks like everyone...  Stupid lunch.  I got to tell you, it looks like everyone is happy in the studio.  It's very...  I think Jimmy is the happiest.  Oh, that's nice when you go bicycling.  When I go bicycling.  That's really cool. 
[00:27:00]  That's a lot.  Oh, look at these.  What are they?  Wow.  See, you've got a whole wardrobe.  What the hell is that?  I can't...  They're like sneaker slippers, but...  But they're giant.  They got...  They're like Mickey Mouse's shoes.  They're like his size.  They're my size.  They're my size sneaker slippers.  Is that for just trotting around the house?  It certainly is.  Those are big flaming sneaker slippers.  Yeah.  It's like a whole...  A lot of thought went into that.  It really did.  It certainly did.  He is one of the most thoughtful guys.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  You realized...  Wait, we've got to stop for...  Oh, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  What's open?  Oh, remember Norton?  Yeah.  I got the...  What else?  Oh, there's plenty more for James.  Chris, you need to give out a plug or anything?  No.  Why not?  That's what we do now.  What do you want to plug?  Yeah, what do you want to plug?  I want to plug Verizon.  Blah, blah, blah.  Verizon.  We don't want to plug Verizon.  Yeah, you know.  What is...  Oh, a belt buckle.  A big flaming belt buckle.  Wow.  The belt I was telling you about with the bullets.  That's coming.  That's coming.  Good.  It's always good when you don't bring all the gifts for even one shot. 
[00:28:00]  I'm a happy boy.  I've been mailing Steve's stuff for a long time.  Of course.  This is the first time I ever met Steve.  I've just been mailing stuff to him.  It's a magical moment.  All right, Chris, thank you.  Anything else you guys want to say?  Hello to Zoltan.  Hello to Dan Schick.  Yeah, right on, Dan.  I know that guy.  All right.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  This was great.  All right, bro.  Nice.  I hope he got the Nirvana poster.  I got the signed Jack Nicholson picture.  Steve got more flameware than he knows what to do with.  Everyone wins here today. 
[00:28:30]  Everyone's happy.  Give the lunchbox back to Jimmy as we go to break.  Here's your Kiss lunchbox.  Yeah, you should have.  You should keep that, Jim.  That's right.  I like it.  That's nice for anybody that might want it.  That's the sound of quality.  Yeah.  Here's the sound of quality.  Sounds like when you shut the door on your Saturn.  Piece of shit.  Oh.  Four raised faces.  Pristine condition.  Oh, wow.  Don't bring me anything next time.  Holy shit. 
[00:29:00]  Do you realize who you hired?  He's a destructive influence.  And me.  He happens to be a dwarf.  What horrible game.  Our new bosses said you guys should get as crazy as you want.  They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity.  Opie and Anthony show.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony show.  We played the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  The listeners, you gotta love them.  We love you guys.  You took it upon yourself to have some fun with the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Stay tuned.

The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We cannot get enough of the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  He totally loses it at the end of that.  Yeah.  Like he loses it.  He was kind of doing a good job with I want to do this to you and that.  And then at the end it's just like, yeah, you come up, hookers.  And then he's just throwing words out.  Hookers.  Fuck.  You.  Drugs.  Coke.  Coke.  Fuck.  You know what happens? 
[00:30:00]  Ass.  Eat.  Fuck.  You know what happened?  I've been studying these tapes since we started playing them.  Studying?  Yeah.  I'm studying this whole thing.  Studying the tapes.  It just amazes me.  He just ran out of things he wanted to do with her.  I know.  That's what the problem was.  Well, you know, there is only so much you can do.  Right.  And when it comes down to it.  Unless you're kidding me.  That'd be interesting.  I should have shit on my chest.  Piss in my mouth.  New things can be added in.  This guy.  What a rookie.  Oh, my God.  That's all right.  Fuck.  Suck.  That's pretty much it. 
[00:30:30]  You know, what are you going to do?  I want to tickle behind your kneecap.  Yeah, that's good.  Well, then her and Betsy make out, so he does kind of like go back the other way.  Yeah.  Yeah, he kind of tried, but I don't think he pulled it off.  He tried to bring the romance back just a little bit.  The romance.  After saying how he wanted to jerk off in her face, then he brings it back a little bit.  I want you to have a miscarriage and then spoon with Betsy.  Oh, Betsy.  Poor Betsy.  You know, we've been doing a lot of interviews in there. 
[00:31:00]  Well, what's the difference between regular radio and satellite radio?  Yeah.  Answer, the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  That pretty much sums it up.  Because no one is having fun like we are with these things.  No one.  And now the listeners and our interns, they're all starting to make their own versions of the sex tapes.  Remember, we encouraged that yesterday, Anthony.  Only on this show do you have the forum to, at home, at your own recording equipment, take some of these clips, throw them together, send them to us, and we actually play it. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  Only on this program.  Here's the problem.  We go on vacation after tomorrow.  Yep.  So if you want in on this quick little bit that we've been doing the last few days, you've got to start hustling and get it into us, okay?  Last show before vacation tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  And I think the audio, the sex tapes audio for now is up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  Right.  But Danny, our own intern, came up with this.  Listen to this one.  Save message Sunday, 9.04 p.m. 
[00:32:00]  You're so fucking hot.  I have a big cock.  I want you to suck it.  I told Betsy, Betsy's so jealous.  If you agree with this, when I see you, walk by me in the hallway.  Don't punch me in the face.  I want to get Betsy in and just pick up Jane Mansfield's head and eat it.  If you're into this, just breathe while you're in the office.  Oh, I just want to put white powder in an envelope and dump it in your face and fuck you all.  If you want to fuck my cock, just look at me stupidly and kind of half-smile.  That was a Shibo reference, I remember. 
[00:32:30]  Jane Mansfield's head and eat it.  Bravo, Danny.  Bravo.  That is sexy.  All right, Anthony, then the listeners started sending in there.  Pat O'Brien, sex tape, remixes.  I want to play one from Joe that came in late last night.  Is it sexy?  Yeah, it's very sexy.  Sexy.  He definitely sexed his version up here. 
[00:33:00]  Listen to this.  This guy cannot control himself.  He's got to call this woman and kill her.  Let's get crazy.  Let's go.  God, you're so fucking hot.  I'm so fucking in here.  It's incredible.  It'll make you come.  Girl, you'll make me feel real good.  I'm so fucking in here.  They can do it till we won't wake up.  But I want to fucking make you crazy. 
[00:33:30]  Girl, you know I'm hooked on you.  You're so fucking hot.  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you.  I want to sex you up.  And suck your tits.  All right.  I want to sex you up.  I fucking want to fucking make you crazy.  I want to run to the ground.  Sex you up. 
[00:34:00]  Sex you up.  The worst part is I didn't fucking a girl named Betsy.  I wanted to knit a flag and I'd eat your cunt.  God damn.  That is great.  How embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  Joe, good job.  We could just talk about this all day.  I love the Pat O'Brien tapes.  We're giddy as is because vacation's right around the corner.  We could just do this thing all day long. 
[00:34:30]  Pat O'Brien.  Yeah.  The other news stations, the news station's been hitting on it, but they can't play it.  No.  That's the beauty of the satellite.  Yeah.  You can just play this and it doesn't matter.  People love it.  It takes away when you got a bleep.  Imagine how many times we'd have to bleep that.  It would be awful.  To listen to it just bleeped.  Well, Anthony, the story gets better.  Oh, no.  It can't possibly.  The story gets better. 
[00:35:00]  Give the recap.  Well, Pat O'Brien was leaving these messages on this girl's machine.  Sexually explicit.  You heard him here.  And then it got a little worse.  We reported that there's a photograph.  Yeah, the girl, I guess Betsy, has this ex-husband who has possession of a photo of Pat O'Brien jacking.  Just a picture of a glistening, sweaty Pat O'Brien with dick in hand getting down to business. 
[00:35:30]  Yes, and that picture is probably going to be making the rounds soon in the tabloids somewhere on the Internet.  Yeah.  But you're saying now it gets a little worse?  Well, yes.  According to the Daily News, the gossip column called Gate Crasher.  This guy, Ben.  The guy who writes Gate Crasher.  Ben does the gossip column?  Yeah, Ben Whitcomb does the thing. 
[00:36:00]  Access Hollywood battle on.  We should probably leave poor old Pat O'Brien alone, but the stories keep coming.  A source tells us he used to refer to a gay African-American senior producer at Access Hollywood as the fruit monkey.  Oh, Jesus.  And he would say this to her face.  Are you kidding me?  Or to his face.  Excuse me.  His face.  He would say this to his face. 
[00:36:30]  A source tells us he used to refer to a gay African-American senior producer at Access Hollywood as the fruit monkey.  Oh.  This guy just lost his mind.  He was probably just doing coke and drinking during...  You, Betsy, me, and the fucking fruit monkey.  Get him in here.  I want to fuck the fruit monkey in the ass.  You eat Betsy.  I want the fruit monkey to climb a tree and pound a banana into my anus. 
[00:37:00]  Follow his nose.  It always knows.  That's the latest today.  The fruit monkey.  Oh, I'm sure now all allegations are going to be coming out about him.  A lot of former staffers probably going to start coming out and saying, yeah, this guy's a farang.  It was also, um, in the same thing, they talk about how he was hitting on Oprah Winfrey as well.  Ugh.  He does deserve to be in rehab. 
[00:37:30]  I guess he was at...  How drunk do you have to be to try to hit on that?  I guess he was at the Four Seasons in L.A., saw Oprah Winfrey at the bar.  Uh...  Oprah Winfrey walks into a bar.  I fucked her.  Me and Betsy and the fruit monkey.  I guess he went up to Oprah Winfrey.  She's the fat monkey, I call her.  Went up to Oprah Winfrey in the bar and was starting to flirt with her and try to pick her up.  Right.  And she didn't go for it.  Yeah.  Obviously.  So, I hope all the stories get out before we go on vacation. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, please.  We're going to be reading about that on vacation.  Going, damn it!  Really?  Why aren't we on the air?  We're going to have to call up.  Me and you will call the studio and do a little break from our vacations.  It's like, turn on the station!  Turn it on, we've got to talk about the...  Turn on the channel, we need to talk about this now.  All right, then, while we were on a train back from Washington yesterday, Anthony, our  own Derek came up with a little remix.  Ooh!  Took to Pat O'Brien's sex tapes and came up with this. 
[00:38:30]  Saved message, Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  I know what's wrong with me and why I'm like this, but I want to fuck you.  I want to fuck you so great in the air.

[00:39:30]  Bye.  I want to suck your pussy.  Fuck dirty, Gio.  Beat off your face.  Fire up her.  You're so fucking hot.  You're a fucking hot.  I want to fuck you. 
[00:40:00]  I want to fucking laugh so crazy with you, man.  You're so crazy.  So crazy with you.  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  You have no more messages.  Hey, fruit monkey.  I want to fuck you in the ass while you bang cymbals together and smile.  If you want to do this with me, just swing from your tail and throw shit at my face. 
[00:40:30]  Fruit monkey.  I want you and four friends to drag me out of my semi-rig and beat me with a sink on all  the street.  I want to walk up to you in a train and shoot you a few times.  Motherfucker.  Let's just get nuts.  Let's get crazy.  If you ask for five bucks, I'll paralyze you. 
[00:41:00]  It just gets better and better.  Oh, God.  What a creep.  There is no other word.  What is your major malfunction, fruit monkey?  Your name's Fruit Monkey.  A banana in your footlocker.  I want you and Betsy to tie me up and hold a blanket over me and beat me with a soap and 
[00:41:30]  a sock.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  God.  Fruit monkey.  What an ass.  What a complete.  That's fantastic.  Ass.  That's a classic.  He really is a classic.  That's great.  He would say it right through his face.  Hey, fruit monkey.  No one says it right to someone's face ever.  And he probably had a smile and like, yeah. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  It's okay, Pat.  Oh, God.  Deal with a Pat O'Brien.  What a horny guy.  That's some fantastic stuff.  We'll see what comes out in the future on Pat O'Brien.  I think his job's in jeopardy.  You think?  He's still on their website, the Insider website.  They have him on there with his bio and his bio lists all of his credits and how long  he's been in the business.  His long career, which ends now.  Right.  Well, it's controversy. 
[00:42:30]  Controversy sells.  Of course, they're going to keep it up there for a while.  And then.  Because everyone's searching on any info they can on Pat O'Brien now.  They have his statement that he made.  Oh.  Thanking his fans.  Oh, really?  And saying that he's entering rehab.  And that he wants to get back to work as quickly as possible.  I'm sure he does.  Good luck with that one.  Yeah, that ain't happening anytime soon, huh?  Oof.  This isn't something you could just walk out of rehab and go back to work.  How do you put that suit on and sit there and talk about Britney Spears gaining a little 
[00:43:00]  weight or any of the other inane celebrity stories when you're the biggest story?  You know?  I didn't see anything on the insider website about his story.  You know, you know they all are sitting there going, oh my God, I want to dig into this.  We want to do this story.  You know they're doing it on Entertainment Tonight and all the other ones.  With that wacky voice lady?  Wee, wee, wee, wee.  Hmm.  Maybe now he'll be honest on the show. 
[00:43:30]  Talk honestly.  Nah.  Maybe just look at the camera.  If you want to fuck me, just call.  Write.  Do something.  Britney Spears put a little weight on it.  Seems like there's a little more jiggler to step.  Don't get me wrong, I'd still eat her ass after a workout.  Me, Betsy, the fruit monkey.  We all get together.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  I'm calling the fruit monkey.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.

Good morning, guys  You're killing me  Just a little nugget for you  I think we need to go in the direction of the fruit monkey  And the chimps that ate the guy's ass in general  I want you to bite my fingers off  Tear my lips off  Eat half of my ass  Guys, good vacation  Oh, nice, Joe 
[00:45:00]  Could you bite Betsy's thumb off first?  I'll push her away and you can eat my ass  Fruit monkey  Oh, wow  He's insane  He really is  Scott in Wisconsin  What's up, Scott?  Yeah, I think that guy  Great show, by the way  But I think he's a little manic depressive  A little manic?  Yeah, when you're like that  You get those feelings like that  That you're, you know, you're God  And you can fuck anything like that  Dude, that had booze and coke written all over it 
[00:45:30]  Yeah  Those phone calls  You don't make those unless you are so drunk and coked out  You're missing one  What?  Booze, coke, Viagra  You think he was sitting there with a big heart on, too?  Big raging purple one  Just pulsating  Pulsating and damn things mocking him  Laughing at him that there's no chick there  Right  Come on, call again, asshole  It's only been three minutes  I can't sit here in your lap all fucking day  All right, cock  His penis is talking to him 
[00:46:00]  His dick is talking to him  What are you doing?

[00:46:30]  His cock  His big raging heart on  Sitting in his lap, taunting  Laughing  I must blame my penis, ladies and gentlemen  Laughing  If you're into this  Bite Betsy's thumbs off  Laughing  His little coats  I love it  The O.B. and Anthony Show  Ah, March of the Penguins, Anthony  Ah, you went and saw this lousy movie  That was fucking funny, man  Just enjoy this one, folks 
[00:47:00]  Laughing  Stop, Jimmy  We gotta give him a little something, something  March of the Penguins  I, uh, I enjoyed the movie  And I discuss it here  So, uh, listen in, I guess  Here's O.B. and Anthony  When they don't suck  Good for what ails you, what, what  The worst of O.B. and Anthony  I had a weird, uh, day after the show  Went home, slept three hours  And then I woke up and watched The Machinist  I love that movie  You suggested that movie to me  Yes, good one  Christian Bale 
[00:47:30]  I got it on demand  I love my movies on demand  I love that feature  Isn't it fantastic?  It's unbelievable  The best part  Sit there  In your home  I'm not a big fan when I'm home  Uh, to watch a movie all the way through  I'm just not  What is that?  I don't know  I like to watch it in halves  It's really weird  You're like  I watch like the first hour  And then usually I crash  And then with this movie's on demand  You get the movie for like 24 hours  Yeah, then you can watch the rest of the  With the rewind feature  You know the deal  Yep  And then I, uh, I continue watching my movie  It's great 
[00:48:00]  I can't do that  I have to finish watching it  I could get through a lot more movies that way  Yeah  It seems, yeah  And so I watched the second half of The Machinist  And man, you were right  That movie's fucked up  It is really a freaky movie  Christian Bale  He lost what?  I don't know  Like 50, 60 pounds for the movie  He was emaciated  He looked ridiculous  So skinny  I know they were using makeup  As far as really, um, accentuating the ribs and stuff  They fill in a little dark in between them  And his spine and stuff like that 
[00:48:30]  But you can't, through CGI or anything else  Cut out pieces of a human like that  He lost that much weight  And it wouldn't be so amazing  If it wasn't for the fact that his next movie was Batman  Where he's, you know, a workout  He's all pumped up and everything  Right  How the hell do you do that?  Well, they showed him as a fatter guy in The Machinist as well  Yeah  And it was, it was just, it was an interesting movie  I mean, Christian Bale basically, uh, slowly but surely going crazy over 
[00:49:00]  Something that happened to him  Yeah  You know  And then they kind of weave that in through the movie  They bring it all together at the end  But, uh, yeah, his weight loss for the movie was just amazing  Definitely a recommend  It was kind of a creepy movie  And then I got all set and ready to go for my March of the Penguins  Whoa  You saw March of the Penguins  Well, we talked about it on the show so much  I figured, you know, one of us has to go and see it  You're like Mr. Documentary these days  You are Mr. Documentary 
[00:49:30]  Well  You went to go see Murderball  Murderball was awesome  Murderball was awesome, man  We're going to have Mark Zupan on today  The star of Murderball  And I thought when I talked about Murderball the first time  About two, three weeks ago now  Maybe two weeks ago  I was surprised because usually you throw something out there  And then the phones, you know, start ringing like crazy  And people want to comment about the shit we talk about, right?  Yeah  Murderball, not one phone call  And it turns out that it hasn't really been released to the rest of the country yet  Only in selective theaters  In like New York, probably L.A. and a couple other big cities 
[00:50:00]  That's it  But I guess they're now going to release this thing all over the place  Yeah  So we're going to talk to Mark Zupan about that today  But yeah, then I saw March of the Penguins yesterday  And it was  Was it inspiring?  It was interesting  Did it make you laugh and make you cry?  Like the movie says  Made me laugh, made me cry  Were you weeping over the little penguins?  Made me think  Made me think that I would be an awful parent  Because my egg would roll out and just freeze to death 
[00:50:30]  Is that what  Every nature show you watch  When they're having the kids  When their little animals are having their eggs or babies or something  It's never just a happy scene  Where everyone has their little babies  And everything goes well  There's always the couple that they have to show  The little animal couple that's just  Not fit to be parents  Not fit to be parents  It didn't pan out  There's some vulture diving down and grabbing its young  There's always something 
[00:51:00]  I  As you know, obviously  I have a dark sense of humor  And parts of that movie where  I actually saw, you know, people crying  A lot of old people watching March of the Penguins for some reason  I guess they have nothing else to do during the day  And there were times during the movie that  Obviously they were tugging at your heartstrings  And inside I wanted to laugh so fucking hard  Because it just is funny to me  And the old people are all weeping  Basically, the March of the Penguins is a movie about 
[00:51:30]  The Emperor of Penguins, whatever  Yeah  And they live their lives in the water  Eating their fish and stuff  And avoiding the lion seals  Or the sea lions and all that crap  Yeah  And then it's time to mate  So they just know, you know  It's that time of year to mate  So they all come out of the water  And march 70 miles to their mating area  Now why can't they just  Screw where they are?  That's what I was trying to figure out  I don't get these wacky 
[00:52:00]  Instinctual things that these animals have to do to fuck  They explain it because the winter is so harsh  You know, the surroundings where they mate  It's covered so it protects them a little better from the elements  Oh, gotcha  And also, let's see, I'm going to explain this to you  Thank you  The ice is a lot thicker in that area  Ice is thicker  Because, you know, they're going to be there for a while  When the spring thaw happens  Or the summer thaw, whatever  Because their seasons were all messed up 
[00:52:30]  They started marching in, like, March  Well, that makes perfect sense  But that was the beginning of winter  Yeah  Because they live way down there  The South Pole  So I guess, what, winter starts in  March down there?  South of the equator  Winter  Okay  Is our summer  And vice versa  So they march 70 miles to this area  And the ice is a lot thicker when it starts thawing  You know, they don't want their young falling through the ice  Of course  So they march  Which is the creepiest thing 
[00:53:00]  They walk like humans  And they did a great job filming it  Because, you know, they show them from a distance  And they look like aliens or something  Because, you know, it's pretty creepy down there  How many did they say do this?  Oh, my God  They just showed thousands and thousands  Really?  Just all walking?  Yeah, walking  The little penguin waddle walk?  Walking  And they have to walk 70 miles to their mating area, right?  70 miles  And they show the lazy ones that decide  Ah, they're going to hang out in the water for a few more weeks or days 
[00:53:30]  And they're way behind  And they show them and basically say  Well, these are not going to make it  Not going to cut it  They started their march a little too late  Because it's all a timing thing, you know?  And they basically said  These will not make it to the mating area  See, every animal is just like humans  There still is a lazy motherfucker that won't leave  Yeah, that's exactly the point I was getting at  I just started laughing  Because inside, you know?  I didn't want to like the movie for others  Because in my real life I try to be a human being 
[00:54:00]  But I'm laughing inside  Going, God, just like you said  This is just like regular  Real people would do the same thing  And have the majority doing what they've got to do  And the few stragglers would just end up dead  Did you find that the lazy ones didn't have that white thing painted in the middle?  Anyway  So then they get to the mating area  Paint it  I know, what the fuck?  Like they take a little roller and just paint their little bellies 
[00:54:30]  So they march to 70 miles  Yeah  And now they have to choose a mate  How do they do that?  Because I know usually in the animal world  It's a pretty elaborate thing that they do to get their mate  They're just marching around trying to figure it out  And they just kind of pair up  And then eventually in this movie they show  They show this whole mess of penguins  All of a sudden all paired up nice  They're all paired up  All paired up nice  Out of nowhere they just decided to pick somebody 
[00:55:00]  And that's who they're mating with  I forget what they said about that  But then all of a sudden  There's got to be a criteria for each one  Why they're with a certain mate  And why they didn't pick that one  I don't think they got into that as much  But the females do fight over the males  Because there's a lot more females than males  I guess  And they showed that which was really funny  Hilarious actually  Making noises at each other  Oh yeah  They do a wacky little pose  And go  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Just freaking out  The penguin 
[00:55:30]  So then they show  This is where it was kind of  This is where the movie's kind of a downer  In a way  Aww  Because they're obviously going for the kid audience as well  You know they're going to show the penguins having sex  But they barely show it  Really?  They barely show it  No banging  It looks like they like the old  The old doggy style  Oh really?  Is that how they were doing it?  One penguin standing straight up 
[00:56:00]  And the other one kind of  Hunched over a bit?  On all  Pretty much on her belly  Really?  Pretty much on her belly  And the gentleman penguin just kind of  Struts up behind  Waddles  Waddles in and out I guess  Jams it in  And then  That's got to look silly  And then they even say  You know if  If it's done right  There's an egg right?  Uh huh  And the egg is  They show the egg  And now  The egg  Just one egg?  Yeah one egg  One egg 
[00:56:30]  The female has the egg there  And now the female has to pass the egg  On to the male  I had no idea about this  They pass it to the male  And they practice  Because it's  It's way down there  And it's way cold  So if the egg is exposed  For too long  They're saying like  If it's exposed more than a few seconds  Done  This egg will not hatch in the spring  It'll freeze?  It'll freeze  So the penguins  Instinctively know to practice the move of passing the egg  What do they practice with? 
[00:57:00]  Well they're just like  They line up  And bump into each other  Front to front?  Yeah front to front  And they kind of roll the egg  From you know  Their little penguin feet  To the other penguin feet  Is this the type of penguin  Because I've seen other nature shows  Where they kind of have the egg  On top of their little feet  Yes  And they kind of waddle  With the egg a little bit  And then they sit down on it  Yeah that's the weird thing  The feet of the penguin  Is the nest  Right  Okay so the female  Passes the egg over  To the male 
[00:57:30]  You know penguin  And he's supposed to put it  Right on his feet  And squat down on it  And stay like that  For 125 days  Waddling around  Making sure the egg  Does not fall  From its penguin feet  Now who brings him food?  Well this is where  It gets interesting  The reason the female penguin  Is passing it to the male penguin  Yeah  Is so she could march  The 70 miles back  To where she could get  Back into the ocean  So she leaves  She leaves  And goes back  Another 70 miles  To go feed and have fun  Yeah 
[00:58:00]  For I forget how long  Like maybe up to a month  Or whatever  I'm trying to remember  Maybe three months  I don't know  And then the male  Is stuck in the cold  With the rest of the male penguins  With the egg on its feet  As the nest  Waiting for spring  Keeping it warm  Trying to keep it warm  And trying to keep themselves warm  And they're starving to death  Because they will not eat  For 125 days  No one brings them food?  Well  No  No no no  He just sits there  Without eating  For that long  For 125 days 
[00:58:30]  How is that at all possible?  With winter just pounding you  Don't they have  Little penguin interns  To bring them a bagel  Nothing  Or an apple  That they can throw at them  You get flippers off the fork  Would you?  But then  So the female  Passes the egg  To the male penguin  Right?  And most of them  Do it flawlessly  Yeah  But they showed a few couples  That just stink  Oh no  There's always the ones  And it's basically  Just rolling the egg  They're a foot apart tops 
[00:59:00]  Rolling the egg  And then the male  Grabs it  And that's it  Done  Done  And all of a sudden  They show like one penguin  Rolling it  And all of a sudden  It just rolls off to the side  And then they both  Just stare at it  Because they know  It's just over Johnny  Now it's just over  And they're just losers  That is so sad  It got a big laugh  From me inside  And a lot of people  Started crying  At that point  And then Morgan Freeman  Who does a great job  With the narration 
[00:59:30]  And he's like  Well  Their job is done here  So now they just  They just walk back  To the ocean  Walk back  There's no reason  Good job  Asshole  There's no reason  To be in this area anymore  Do you think there's blame  In the animal world?  Do you think  As they're walking back  70 miles  That either she's  Nagging at him  Or he's  Popping her in the face  Or just something  I told you  I was passing it  Wait a second  Good eyes asshole  But that's where 
[01:00:00]  I started laughing  Because they do  Look kind of human  When the egg rolls off  The penguin  Is just looking down  They stare at it  Like  All the rest  The walk  The sitting here  Everything  Nothing  It starts whining  All for naught  All for nothing  He's probably  The lucky one though  He doesn't have to  Put up with the kid  He got to drop the load  Here you go  He probably did it on purpose  Oops  Drop the egg  That's like us humans  Call it the old  Kick down the stairs  The old  The old foot comes out  When she's walking  By the stairwell  The old whoops-a-daisy  The old Doc Martin 
[01:00:30]  To the gut  So that's what  Made me laugh hard  Because then they show  The elements  Just split the egg  Open immediately  Because it's very  Very very fragile  Can you go over  And get it  What's the problem  Just go get the  Fucking egg  I explained to you  Jimmy  If it's exposed  For more  Yeah  It's exposed too long  And they just know  That it's already dead  So then the ones  That are able  To pass the egg  Successfully  Now the male  That's where it's a drag 
[01:01:00]  They have to stand there  For 125 fucking days  Not eating  Freezing their asses off  They all just  Go into one big huddle  And that's how  They spend 125 days  That's ridiculous  Four months  And the weird  Yeah  It's a long time  And the weird thing is  Eventually  The parents  And the kid  Will all just go  Their own ways  Like there's not even  What's called a family  Yeah  It doesn't exist  There's no family  After that  No  As soon as the youngins  Are old enough 
[01:01:30]  To jump in the ocean  Themselves or whatever  The water there  They just go  Never see each other again  That's what they say  In the documentary  They'll pretty much  Never see each other again  So it's like  All that effort  And what's the payoff  In the end  You know  Some families  That would invite that  Exactly  Enough of you  So the females march back  And they just like  Get nice and fat  And then the males  They don't really  They don't eat for 125 days  But they store some weird  Crap in their mouths  Because when the kid is born  Because the kid is born  While the male is  Hang on  They spit it up 
[01:02:00]  Yeah they pretty much  Open their mouths  And the youngins there feed  That's great  Shit from three  Four months ago  In his mouth  Old  Placked  Trying to eat  He's got plaque breath  So then  Then they show  The female penguins  Just having a good old time  In the water  Just I mean  There's so much food  It's not even funny  Getting nice and fat  And then when they feel like  They decide to march back  Now to where the males are  With the  With now the  The little hatchlings  You know  They're just gonna hatch like crazy  And you see the females 
[01:02:30]  Over the horizon  Finally coming back  And now the males  Lose their freaking minds  Males get to leave  Oh they start screaming  And yelling  They're making that penguin sound  They're very happy  Of course they are  And then the males  Because you know  They don't have much fur on them  They pass the young ones  Back to the females  And now the males  Job is done  70 miles  And they now go  Back to the ocean  Back to the ocean  After not eating for four months  They had to walk 70 miles  Yeah  And they basically say  Some of these guys  Will never make it 
[01:03:00]  You know  They just won't make it  Penguins stink  Snap man from a whack bag  In one week  Opie went from  What the hell is  March of the Penguins  To I love this penguin movie  I didn't say I loved it  It was  I don't know  It's better than the garbage  That's in the regular theaters  For the most part  You know  It was good  It was interesting  But there were a lot of laughs  A lot of laughs  And then the young ones  They're running around  All cute right  And then they showed  The birds coming 
[01:03:30]  Oh what  The predators  Predator birds  Eating the babies  Oh this one nasty bird  They never all make it  Do they  This one nasty bird  Is just nibbling away  At the little  Baby penguin's necks  And this is where  They cleaned it up  Because they know  They're going to have  A lot of kids  Going to see the movie  They don't really show  The bird  Just pretty much  Snapping the little  Little penguin's neck  Little penguin neck  They kind of  They kind of play the audio  In the background  Where it's just awful  You just know 
[01:04:00]  It's just horrific  What little screams  Little penguin screams  You know it's just horrific  And then they show  The rest of the penguins  Just making them believe  They're not seeing that  And ignoring  What's going on  Over there  Penguins aren't known  As being like  The tough guy  Of the nature world  No  Not really the tough guy  So there you go  I figured someone  Had to go see this movie  We were talking about it  For a week  Yeah  But it was good  And then I was seeing  Previews for all sorts  Of other movies  And I'm like  Why don't I go to  Like these artsy  Movie theaters 
[01:04:30]  More often  The movies seem  A little more interesting  Than going to see  Like Bad News Bears  Or I don't know  I can't take a steady diet  Of the artsy fartsy movies  No  Well Murderball was cool  And that was just  In the arts  No I think that was  In a regular theater  Actually  You're just the  Documentary king now  Do you hear that new  Penguin movie they're making  Where at the end  They have a match  And a crop duster  With gas  And flies over  And takes care of  All that noise  Now that I'd pay money  To see  Hey this is Howie Mandel

[01:08:00]  Look what we're doing  Don't brag  Well Jason was one of these  Look what we're doing  Type of guys  And he finally got busted  Am I wrong  No absolutely wrong  Okay  So he got busted  He's in Rikers I guess  The story exploded  And Natalia went and did  A bunch of TV  And she was on the cover  Of New York Magazine  Talking about it  Right  A really long article  That they didn't interview you for  They  Jason wanted me in the article  He told this dumb reporter  A contact base 
[01:08:30]  So the reporter contacted me  I got back to him  And he never got back to me  We missed each other like twice  By the way  If anybody has that article  On Natalia  Could you send that  New York Magazine  And I think it's off the stands  And I didn't buy it  I'd love to have that  I never banged a chick  On the cover of a magazine  Before  You don't have that magazine  No I don't know where it is  That issue  But I banged her  And she was on the cover  Of a magazine  You know how great that is  And it was a hot  Bend over show her ass shot  Oh really  Yeah  Someone please send that  If you have it  And I think you banged her  When we were on the  Premium channel  So you want to walk us  Through this a little bit more  Because we have a lot  Of new listeners  Since you did this 
[01:09:00]  Well Jason was a fan  So he sent in these girls  It was Natalia  And another one  And they were nice enough  I mean they hung out  In the studio  And I was very attracted  To Natalia  Because she had a  You know kind of  A nice vag  Which I like  You like the puffy ones  And meaty  Anything that just looks like  You'd be embarrassed  To get undressed with it  Short brown hair  Very petite  Very sexy girl  Very sexy yes  And Jason  Like you said  Offers us all an hour  And I fully intend  To take mine  And I do  And I take it  With Natalia 
[01:09:30]  And it's a girlfriend  Experience  A lot of kissing  BBBJ  Oh yeah  Kissing  BBBJ  Bareback blowjob  Right  No rubber  Condom for sex  I believe  I do wear rubber for sex  I wouldn't have  If she didn't  You know  Make me  Of course  And it was free  Totally free  Not a dime  I hope they did film me  My fat awful  White fish belly  Playing with my nipples  While she blows me  Can't watch it  And this was done 
[01:10:00]  In Manhattan  In a really nice place  Right  Gorgeous place  And I hung with him  For a while  We talked  Like talk about  The place a little bit  They offered you alcohol  But you don't drink  They had a nice little  Bar area  A lounge area  With a bar  It's like a really  Cool hang  A couple of nice  Hot chicks  Walking around  A security guy  I'm sitting there  With Jason  We're talking  He's trying to show me  This documentary  That he's doing  Like a reality show  On VH1  He wanted to pitch  About the place  I'm like  Dude this is an escort service  How are you going to have  A reality show about this  I was watching it  And then 
[01:10:30]  Natalia's changing  In her room  So I go in there  She's with another girl  Jason's like  Dude I want you to come  Once a week  He used to call me  It took me like a month  To get down there  Dude come once a week  I'll hook you up  Threesomes  Whatever you want  He offered me like  Two chicks  That day  I didn't get greedy  I only took the one  Because I honestly got  It doesn't surprise me  That they filmed  Part of me was like  Eh you never know  They may film  You just  You didn't know  You know  It's like  For security reasons  They might do it  You know this would have been  Consider plug-ola 
[01:11:00]  Probably yeah  That's what he was looking for  I guess  And I would have given him to him  Take care of you  I mean he's a fan of yours  And all  But then  He knew you'd go on the radio  And talk about this  Let's get this out right now  If you're an escort service  Or whatever  And you give me free pussy  You're getting plugged  That's the way it works  On this show  I plug you  Screw the plug-ola laws  Plug-ola nothing  I'm just talking about my life  And I'm making it funny  Right  Even if no one laughs  I'll yell LOL  And I'll go back 
[01:11:30]  And fuck some more  I can't believe  I didn't take him up  On those threesomes though  So you take her  In the back room  Yes it's nice  A beautiful bedroom right  Beautiful bedroom  She's wearing a little  Music playing  The only thing I didn't like about it  Was it daylight  There was too much light  Coming through the window  I kind of like it dark and dim  You know the whole shame angle  Is kind of nice  Don't we all  Just two people lurking around  In the darkness  Clumsily groping  Pretending it's anybody else  Until something slips in  Yeah exactly  Who really likes a spotlight  On them when they're having sex 
[01:12:00]  Dude it was bright  But now I know  They probably do that  So they get good footage  That's why they invented candles  So we could see each other  When we're having sex  Well so I fucked her  And it was really nice  And I got sick right after  I did eat her ass  Yes you ate her ass  And got some wicked cold  After it  I just got it  Everyone was sick at that point  We called it the ass flu  Yeah  Jimmy got the ass flu  I forgot about that  Remember 
[01:12:30]  The ass flu  Symptoms  Butterscotch around the nose and mouth  She was terrific  She was really good in bed  Well  And what kind of positions did you do  I think everything  We 69  I enjoyed that  I got on the bottom  69 with her  Made out  Oral sex  Obviously  You know  A little ate her ass  And then I think  Just regular missionary sex  That's the way I like it  While she played with my nipples  And I think I kind of  Just blew into a bag  She claims  She made  1.5 million a year  Servicing high roller clients 
[01:13:00]  Why would you claim that  If you're not paying it in taxes  I know  They'll nail her on that too  Yeah  You can't say  You made that kind of money  And you're not paying taxes on it  You gotta pay taxes  Made no secret of her work  At New York Confidential  A swanky Moroccan themed brothel  She became infamous overnight  And struck a provocative pose  For the cover of New York  Yeah  They labeled her  The New York's  Number one escort  Yeah  Well Jason was calling her that  It used to be the ad  In the magazine  That said 
[01:13:30]  That advertised her  New York's  Number one escort  $2,000 an hour  NY Confidential  Raked in  500 grand a month  During the year and a half  He was in business  I actually talked to her  After Jason got busted  Before she got arrested  I called her  Just to see how he was  And how she was doing  She's like  Yeah everybody's okay  I haven't really talked to them  Did you really call her  To see how she was doing  I did actually  Because she's not going to  Come and bang me for free  I mean the guy's in jail  So I was like  Yeah it's called to say hello  I didn't expect anything  To come out of it 
[01:14:00]  Yeah  And clients that included  I've hoped  Hedge funds  Hedge fund titans  Politicians  Lawyers  And even an NFL quarterback  Uh oh  God  This story definitely  Has legs  I'm sure Ben knows  Who it is  I'm sure he does  And um  Yeah now they're talking  About those cameras  That might have been in there  And some people  You know for Jimmy  To be on camera  He'd wave  Smile  Hope it shows up 
[01:14:30]  On the news  Yeah  But uh politicians  Oof  That's a tough one  I always wondered  If they would do  Something like that  Just in case  They got busted  They could go to  Some of these guys  And go look  Help us out  I'm not going to  Help you out  Well you might want to  Because we have film  Yeah  Well or if you know  He wakes up after  Passing out  The hooker's dead  You got to call  Some associates  Some friends  To come in  And get rid of the problem  I fell asleep  I don't know what happened  I fell asleep  But she got busted 
[01:15:00]  Because she went on  Donnie Deutsch  And was bragging  She was on Paula Zahn  Bragging  She did interviews  Pretty much all over the world  People don't like braggarts  Opie  They don't like the braggarts  So they busted her  In her apartment  And now she's hanging low  Until they defend her  It's a little odd  Based on TV interview things  They must have more  Maybe they have film  Maybe they saw the footage  Maybe  Maybe they have audio  Of this program  That's true  There was some  Incriminating things 
[01:15:30]  Being said there  I think  I'd love to go on  And testify on that one  Oh how much fun  Do we have  I mean because this is  A hot story again  We do have her  Calling the program  Talking about the sex  With me  Talking about the sex  With Jimmy  But he didn't pay  Huh  He didn't pay  I still banged a girl  On a magazine cup  I banged a girl  On the paper  Ant  You know that  Never happens to me  Yeah  That's true  I mean we got audio  Of this girl  I think it would be  Very interesting today  If we could find it  Did you eat the ass  Of this escort  I did indeed eat it  They usually end up  In the paper  After you've had sex 
[01:16:00]  With them  Yeah  Jamie  A shoe with blood  In it is found somewhere  55 gallon drum  Jamie has a comment here  Let's go to Jamie  Oh my god  Jimmy  You know  We love you  But fuck  No condom  What the fuck  No no no  I did use a condom  I'm so glad  Oh you said  It was a bad back  Blowjob  Blowjob  Yes  Oh you don't get

[01:22:00]  Hey Jimmy  I got a friend of mine  A couple times a year  He goes down to Brazil  And for like a week  And picks up hookers  And he got to him  From one of them  Ouch  Ouch  That's silly  He was probably banging  Trance or something  Well you know  He used to say the same thing  Oh it'll never happen to me  It'll never happen to me  And he tested positive here  Oh about six months ago  For us  That's kind of what I said  That's terrific  That's terrific

[01:29:30]  Jimmy was great during this  And my Bill Ward interview  We got to play the rest of the  Sabbath interviews  We got to find what to do with them  Well when we get back from this vacation  We're on we'll do that  Yeah we got to find something to do  You're listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  And I had a ride down with Steve  With his environmentally sound car  The driving bear  Because he cares about the environment  The bit started already  He lives there  Of course he does  I just want some type of an exhaust system  That doesn't bother the berries  When they're growing  Now he can edit 
[01:30:00]  He's up on the gay shit  Oh Jim  The worst of Opie and Anthony  Brrrr  I heard them tell me  That is the fact that we was now  I told them I had risen  Stupid stars and said that  So they're not  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program 
[01:30:30]  The O&A virus spreading across America  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio  XM Satellite Radio  With another huge announcement  In about a half hour  It's a biggie  Jimmy in studio  Bill Burr in studio  Anthony not in studio  He decided to take a leak  And I warned him  Just as he was going into the bathroom  That he is not going to be happy  Why?  I don't know if it's one of our guys  But the bathroom is  Here let's get the comment  How bad was that Anthony? 
[01:31:00]  I warned him  Just as  I was leaving the bathroom  As he was going in  I'm like dude  You do not want to go in there  You know  Is that one of our guys in there?  I don't know  The guy  While I was in there  Wait wait wait wait wait  You walked in  Yeah  And someone was still in the stall?  Yeah  I know who it was then  Who was it?  I'm going to guess  It was one of our guys  Does it begin with an M?  No  I thought it might be Marsh  Was it Martini Steve?  It was Steve  Steve what the fuck did you eat yesterday at OzFest? 
[01:31:30]  Dude let me just explain  Wow  I took a leak  Steve was washing his hands when I walked in  So I assumed he had just taken a leak  No no no  I thought the guy whoever the perpetrator was had left  I took a leak  Usually you would run out wouldn't you?  You'd wait until no one was in there?  Listen?  Right  Run out wait five minutes and then wash your hands later  And be like Jesus  I took a leak  And it usually takes me less than a minute  And I'm out of the bathroom  Within that time you flushed the toilet twice  What the hell were you dumping? 
[01:32:00]  Oh boy Steve  Dude that was sitting in me since 7am yesterday  The smell in the bathroom  It's awful  Well it's not a shock  As we're driving to OzFest  Fucking wants to stop  We stop at a rest area  He wants to get beef jerky snippets  And I'm like why would you eat that?  It's a hundred degrees out  You want to stand there and eat this?  That along with berries and honey  How come these things don't bother you?  Yeah that was just rotten filth  Festering in me since 24 hours ago 
[01:32:30]  Now that we smelled it  Oh my god  What did you eat yesterday?  I'm trying to remember  It was oh egg whites  Oh that was a protein  God  That was a protein  Oh your system decided to finally release  Yeah my system decided to finally release  I cut down on the egg whites  And now I'm finally dumping more regular honey  You know what it had diffused through the entire bathroom  It wasn't like you walk past the stall and it was bad  But then you get by the sinks and it's kind of tolerable  That stench covered the entire bathroom  Every nook and cranny of that bathroom 
[01:33:00]  There was nowhere to go to escape it  That was a protein rich egg white dump  And he tried to pawn it off on someone else  No I didn't  Because Obi walks down the hall  I'm walking toward the bathroom  Obi goes  Man it's bad in there  I'm like oh great I gotta take a leak  I walk in  Now I had assumed whoever was in there had left  So I see Steve washing his hands  So I think Steve was just in there  And I go  Holy shit it stinks in here  And Steve goes  Yeah it's pretty bad  Like someone else did it  Commiserating  It was commiserating 
[01:33:30]  Commiserating with me  I was your own little change person  I'm never really sure of the image  I'm really not sure of the etiquette  Are you supposed to jump up and take credit for it immediately?  Absolutely  Okay I apologize  You should apologize  I go boy it stinks in here  You should have went oh sorry  Okay well I'm sorry  I would have yelled at the office  Go in there quick  Those staples on your stomach are rusting  Yeah that was protein and rusty staples  Jesus  So how was OzFest boys?  Wow  Good time  Yeah Jimmy  I was very happy  Yeah Jimmy got to sit down with some of his heroes  It's going to be very 
[01:34:00]  I predict  It's going to be very tedious audio  Why?  Because it was  You know  Come on  I was shaking  Were you shaking?  Oh my god  Did you go test one two  And check the tape recorder?  No but I  Steve was the one turning it on and off  And every time he did it  I was thinking  If this is not taping  I'm going to cut his Lebanese head off  And kick it  Yeah  I had a nightmare about that  This thing not taping  Making sure it worked  Yeah  And the sound quality was good  Yeah  The levels were okay 
[01:34:30]  It wasn't like when Big Kev took it  No no nothing like that  It's just that every  We had to do these interviews  Either at the  Jaeger tent  Which is very noisy obviously  Because it's outside  Or you do them inside  The trailers  In what's called  Sabbath village  Which is these air conditions  Sabbath village  Yes  It's a place that I love to live  You were freely walking around  Sabbath village  Sabbath village  Well  What Sabbath village is  Is this area behind Ozfest  Geezer, Tony, Bill  And each have trailers  First name basis  Oh yeah  My Terrence actually 
[01:35:00]  Instead of Geezer  They all have like a little trailer  And I think Ozzy has just an extra bus  But I think because they're the musicians  They have a little trailer  They can go to  Behind  Off the bus  Only they're back there  You have to have the complete  All access pass to get back there  Where they can just mellow out  And you know  Bill has a little drum set in his  And I guess Tony has guitars  And they just  It's unbelievable  I had heard about it  But I honestly never seen it  Sabbath village  I was interviewing retards  Next to an inflatable chair  And he's in Sabbath village  Screaming out  Where's Jimmy? 
[01:35:30]  Where's Jimmy?  But you know what?  No I heard  I watched Billy's audio  It was really funny  And then he got some great stuff  And I realized  As I was talking  Like this is going to be interesting  To like hardcore Sabbath fans  The guys were phenomenal  But I mean I was just  You know  Just talking and trying to  Like just ask a question  And let them talk  Did you have to ask  Into a mic that you were holding  And then put the mic for them  And you did a good job with that?  Yeah  They probably felt like  Michael J. Fox  Was holding it in their face  But I mean  At one point  I came off better  Than I thought I would  Like I was actually 
[01:36:00]  More conversational  You are?  Yes  Thank God for YSP  Not like an interrogation  No no no no  And I knew enough about them  Where it just kind of worked for me  I was very  I asked a lot of the same questions  With the guys  But you interview a band  It's usually four guys in a room  Whatever you wanted to ask the band  You ask them  And then each one answers  Yeah but on an individual basis  Now you've got to ask  A couple of the same questions  You have to  It's hard to have 12 different  You know I mean  Three times whatever  Questions  12 different  I hear you  Right  I understand  Why don't we play some of this audio  We start with Pete 
[01:36:30]  The ONA fan  Is this Bill Burr's audio?  No this is  I did a few before  And I handed the mic off to Bill  And then we left Jimmy  We left Bill at the Jaeger tent  And then Jimmy and I  Went off into the Sabbath one  Jaeger village  Excuse me  Jaeger village  Yes  Is this before or after  You ate the rancid possum?  Long after  Oh after okay  Just want to make sure  That was brutal man  I gotta say it again  Take full credit for it  Oh man  We actually  Rarely in these situations 
[01:37:00]  This work out  But definitely  First of all  Adam Greyer from Jaeger Meister  Everything worked  Like it was supposed to  The parking  Like you know  If you go for VIP parking  You're riding in fucking  And of course we get there  And this scumbag  Who looks like Sean Penn  Parking attendant  I know VIP's closed  Yeah  And we're like  No look  No it's not  It's okay  No no no  They just called us  It's closed  What happens  We get on the phone  Fucking little Adam  Who's just kind of like  A short little  You know fella  Comes out  And fucking  Waves his hands  And we go right through it  Everything is as it should be  The ONA van 
[01:37:30]  Exactly where it should be  Did you want to punch  The parking guy?  There's another one later  I'll get to  I wanted to sink my teeth  Into his face  I was beyond angry with him  I just wanted to hold him  And almost lovingly  Just bite him  Yeah there were a few situations like that  Where you know  You got stopped by some low level  On the totem pole security guy  But you know  Yes  You know but our names were on every list  That they were supposed to be on  We had the passes we need  Isn't that great when it works like that?  Well it almost 
[01:38:00]  And I'll get into it  This is like a little tease  There was a problem getting back  For the geezer and Iommi interview  Because they weren't going to let us backstage again  And it was this fucking young kid  Who I can't tell you how bad  I still hope that he was killed on the way home last night  I hope that he was driving  With the other girl who worked there  And they were laughing about something happy  We have our whole lives ahead of us  And all of a sudden  Fifth of whiskey  Right into him  Fifth of whiskey 
[01:38:30]  Right into him with a stage wagon  And I hope he walked away okay  Jesus  Gets charged with manslaughter  He's out in eight months  Exactly  And their young lives are shattered  Non-list reading motherfuckers  I hate the whole backstage thing  I can't  It's like walking on eggshells is what it is  And I know people out there  Like you guys are fortunate enough  To go backstage to these concerts  I was going to be like  Nerve wracking 
[01:39:00]  It stinks on every level  When you have  They got a sponsor badge  I never had a badge at a concert before  Which was  The sponsor badges for Jägermust  Were phenomenal  Yeah  So we go back  We do one  We do Bill  And as we're going back  These young  I met one of the guys back there  I think his name was Mike  I got to say hello  He's the boss of all  The security guys back there  I know I said Mike  I came back with Mike  Huge Opie and Anthony fan  And so we talked  He's like  Dude whatever you need back here  It's yours  We're going to get back again 
[01:39:30]  And these fuckers  Wouldn't let us back  So they call  They send this monster  Named Dan out  Who again thank you too man  Who's also an Opie and Anthony fan  He goes dude  Just hop on the car  You've never seen satisfaction  Yeah  I'm like dude  We're supposed to be back here  We're interviewing Gieser and Tony  In fucking ten minutes  And the guy's like  You're not on the list  And then he calls  Not on the list  And you gotta leave  And the chick  This fucking young chick  Who really should be  Found face down  And brushed somewhere  Was she hot?  Yeah  I really wanted to give her  Heine a licking  Saucy girl  Saucy naughty list  Mr. You  When this kid Dan 
[01:40:00]  Came out  In his grey  They were all wearing yellow  But the bosses wore grey  When Dan came out  Also an Opie and Anthony fan  With a cart  And now we go  Look we're supposed to be back  He goes hop on  I just wanted to turn around  You didn't give him a look?  Look  I mumbled  Fuck and cunt  I was so angry  Oh nice  Gieser and Tony  I wasn't going back  Just to say hello  To somebody  So they got us in  But the bitches  Jim's name was on the list  We were on the list  There's no reason  That he should have stopped  Well yeah  What list did they say 
[01:40:30]  You weren't on?  They're just dummies  The one they weren't looking at  They looked at the sponsor badge  And I'm like  I said to Dan  We were on the list  He goes yeah  You were on the list  And he checked it  We were on the list  The problem with backstage  There's a million lists  That don't  They're all different  Also this year  Apparently there's  Six or seven different laminates  I mean normally  There's one all access laminate  That you get  There's six or seven different ones  And these poor kids  Are looking at these different pages  At these different  Poor kids  He's calling them  Yeah yeah yeah  They're really unfortunate  People that don't know  How to do their jobs  When you're interviewing people  You have loved since 1980 
[01:41:00]  Yeah you're right  Poor kids  I hope they're both dead  Actually no  I hope they're both  Below the neck paralyzed  And they're still awake  And all they're hearing  Is fucking Sabbath songs  Playing  Fuckers  Okay  Let's play some of the audio  Dan and Mike  Thank you so much  Alright  Here's Pete  An ONA fan  At OzFest yesterday  Hey what's your name  I'm Pete  Pete  Pete?

[01:51:00]  I'm sure at times  He's just a sweaty  And he doesn't care  But he sits down  And he just starts going  Yeah  Zach doesn't care  That's a pretty easy interview  Good  We asked him about  The whole Dimebag thing  Has he changed the way  They deal with touring  Or security  Since the whole Dimebag  Oh, that's a good question  I had a stupid moment  With that, too  I didn't know  You did  I've seen part of the video  Which is called  In This River  In This River  Trek 7, yeah  It's a really cool video  Which became like  A Dimebag tribute  But I didn't know  Someone told me  That those were Dimebag's kids  In the video  Because I saw it for a minute  And came to it 
[01:51:30]  At the odds fest  So I asked him about that  And it turns out  Dimebag didn't have kids  So I felt like a dick  I mean, he wasn't a dick about it  But I was like, oof  Alright, let's go to the audio  You have an amazing  Show of force here  I mean, it's fucking  It's like a compound here, man  I mean, there's nobody  Going to cause a problem here  Did that scare you  And make you want to  Bring more people  And go that there are  Some crazy people out there  I better make sure  I'm a little bit, you know  Surrounded with people  Or did it not affect  The way you do business at all  Not at all, man  Uh-oh  I mean, I would never  I would never go down  To a show  And hurt any  You know, like  I would never go down 
[01:52:00]  To an Aussie show  And hurt an Aussie  You know, when I was a fan  You know, I mean, I still am  But I mean, it's just like  You know, you're going down  To see Randy Rhoads  You don't hurt Randy Rhoads  You don't hurt Randy Rhoads  You know, Randy  You go down  Yeah, without a doubt  You know, all we do  Is go up there  And like high-five  After every solo  Randy does  You know what I mean  Because you're seeing greatness  You know what I mean  So  There you go  I already hate my own voice  I already  Jimmy  I'm listening to this  And I'm wishing that Steve  Would just have the fortitude  To take my head  And crack my teeth  Against the console  You did  You did  Fine, Jimmy  I got security  I got security  I got security 
[01:52:30]  Fucking rambling asshole  Happy to be there  Now I can't wait  To hear more Jimmy  Dude, it's awful  You are a really  Stammering ass  And there was one point  I mean, with Zach  I wasn't that nervous  Because Steve was holding the mic  And it was good, too  Because sometimes  I would ask a question  And then he would hold the mic  By my mouth  While he just went  Into a fucking place  Where he's scooping honey  Out of a pot  Fucking creep  And Zach is talking  And I actually had to  Move his hand once  Like, you know  The one with the mouth  Moving and the sound  Coming out of it  That's the one  You hold the mic  That happens once 
[01:53:00]  Large grizzly  Let's go to  Kevin in Philly  I guess he's a new fan  Kevin, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I'm just a little curious  About the story  Behind this whole  Ramon thing is  What, buddy?  You don't know  Who Ramon is?  I'm telling you  We're getting new listeners  Every day  That's the weird thing  I've been listening  For a couple months  And I love you guys  And this is the first time  I've ever heard that  Quickly, quickly, quickly  Ramon is part of a promo 
[01:53:30]  That Steve does for the show  You know those little promos  Those little humorous  Little sound things  That are dropped in  Every so often  During the show  Well, this is nothing like them  Hey, we can play  A quick Ramon promo for you  Listen to this  Hold on, hold on  I'm going to play a promo  Rich guy and his houseboy  Is what it is  Ramon is the houseboy  Let me play this  And then we'll explain  Hit it  That's great  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony  Ooh, it's in my shoes  Ramon, clean this up 
[01:54:00]  See?  Now he's the rich voice guy  That does voiceover work  For movies or wherever  They need voiceover work  And his houseboy is Ramon  And he does unspeakable things  Just to satisfy the old man  Great, sounds good  Exactly  You know, Kevin, I'm with you  That is the perfect reaction  Great  Yeah, sounds good  Sounds good on paper  And your next question should be  I listened to this show  Why? 
[01:54:30]  Can you pay for those  Cell phone minutes?  Alright, Kevin  Yeah, really  Alright, anything else  On the Zach Wilde interview  We want to play?  Anything else?  How about anything at all?  I'm telling you  I'm a bad interviewer  Anything with Jimmy on it  Well, there's so much audio  I don't know if we can get to all of this  I'm trying to just get to the  Talks about going with  Double Duty  He's very respectful towards Ozzy  He talks about a prank he pulled in Philly  Where he wore a dress  With his whole  He brought his whole  Group of guys  Into a mall in Philly  Group of guys?

[01:55:30]  Humna, humna, humna, humna, humna  Just so happy to be communicating  Myself sick  I love it  I'm going to shuffle the future  Dude, I knew it too  I fucking knew this was going to happen  It was just going to be  No  It's fine  It's adorable  It's not adorable  It's irritating  It's like a big clock  Right behind whoever he's interviewing  In ten seconds  He will be kicked off this bus  Hum, hum, hum  When did you start?  When did you start?  You play guitar  You had a dress  You wore a dress  You had bought a dress  Something with a dress  It was like on the $25,000 pyramid  With Zach Lyle  Something with a dress 
[01:56:00]  You wore a dress  You had a dress  Things guys like a homo do  Pass  Pass on  I've got to hear the beginning of this again  Move on  All right, listen again  You did something with a dress  I don't  It was fucking  It was in Philadelphia  I mean, Kim from YSP  Who was in love with you  Was telling me  That you did something with a dress  I don't know what it was  Did you go on stage with a dress  Or did you do something with something with a dress  It was really  I don't even need the answer  I don't even  You said dress like 18 times 
[01:56:30]  Oh, it's awful  Something with a dress  Dad, Dad, Dad  Zach, what's your address?  I need something with a dress  Oh, God  And hit the bell every time he says dress  Any of those questions  I want to try to hear the rest of it  You did something with a dress  I don't  It was fucking  It was in Philadelphia  I mean, Kim from YSP  Who was in love with you  Was telling me  That you did something with a dress  I don't know what it was  Did you go on stage with a dress  Or did you do something in public with a dress  That was really  Completely uncalled for  And hilarious  He tried to reshape that question 
[01:57:00]  Every time he started to ask it  Like, no, that's not the right approach  Let's try this approach  Abort, abort  Go to this way  Go this way  Somebody else  Someone else told me about the dress  No, I knew about the dress  It was hysterical with the dress  Women wear dresses sometimes  You're a fan of the birdcage  Oh, it's not fantastic  We're just  We're smashing your face  We should have been down there 
[01:57:30]  Helping out with this whole thing  You can hear his little heart pounding  Oh, he's freaking out  It was  You kept waiting for them to realize  Wait a minute  You're Jimmy Norton  Go away  Just leave  Old Jimmy Norton  Oh, I kept waiting for my professional mask to fall off  You did something with a dress  I don't  It was fucking  It was in Philadelphia  Yeah, I mean, Kim from YSP  Was in love with you  Was telling me that you did something with a dress  I don't know what it was  Did you go on stage and a dress  Did you do something in public with a dress  It was really  Completely uncalled for and hilarious  See, I'm going to go  Uncalled for  Oh, fuck, that's going to piss me off

I know, that's what I'm thinking  Here's Zach Wilde 
[01:58:30]  I don't know, but if it was  I'm sure it was us  If it was definitely gay  I'm sure we pulled it off  Of course  You know, when you've got guys  That are weighing about 265, 250, 245  You know, with dresses  That they're bursting out of  No, we've got to make sure  The dresses are for like  A 13-year-old pubescent girl  You know what I mean?  So it's like  She doesn't even have puberty  You know  She said you went to a mall  You were in a mall or something like that  With a dress  And you had like your chain wallet  She said it was like  The most ridiculous thing  That's where it was at  Yeah, it was out  Why are you talking so fast? 
[01:59:00]  Oh my God  It's a mile a minute, Jimmy  Was it a big mall?  Was it a big mall?  All kidding aside  Were you just freaking  A lot of space in this mall  Were you just freaking out inside?  Was your adrenaline  Just racing through your veins?  I talk a little quickly  Yeah  I'm scared  It was Zach's bus  Zach was going on  We did have to press for time with him  Because his whole family was there  And he did have to go on soon  He was going to do a signing  And then go on  So the guy was  His brother was really cool  But he's like  Look, he's got to kind of be quick  Just because we have a signing  And then the show 
[01:59:30]  So I was like  Kind of knew that  And his dad walked on the bus  Just as we got there  Like two minutes after we got there  Nice guy his father was too  Hi boys  His father was this World War II vet  Very cool guy  But all of a sudden  Zach wants to go hang with his family  And we're in there  And ask questions about dresses  He's got family there  What do you ask Zach though?  I mean he played with Ozzy  What am I going to do  That's anything remotely interesting?  I've been interviewed  I've had that  I've been on the other side  And I know that the thing  I normally like  Is I hate when interviewers  Try to be funny with me  That never fucking makes me laugh 
[02:00:00]  I just want to ask a question  Ask me a question  Let me answer when I'm finished  Ask the next one  Let me talk until I'm done  That's what I like in an interview  Well we missed the obvious  We have to go to John in Jersey  John go ahead  Yeah Norton  You sound like Johnson Edwards  From Crossing Over  Crossing Over  I'm getting a D  I'm getting a D  I'm getting something  I'm getting a dress  Something with a dress  Does somebody in here wear a dress  Or had a dress  Did the departed wear a dress  Some type of dress  Something with a D  Dignity  Does anybody have any?  Could use a helping 
[02:00:30]  Oh is that great  He's coming in like crazy  He sounds like John Edwards  That's funny  And then Byron  What's up Byron?  Hey boys  Hey Jimmy  I want to know if that's you  Or Rain Man  Doing the interview  I'm punching out  All right  I got to back up a little bit  A little bit  A little bit  I'm going to back up a little bit  He was just scared  Is what everyone's saying  Of course I was  Leave me alone  He was scared  She said you went to a mall  You were in a mall or something like that 
[02:01:00]  With a dress  And you had like your chain wallet  She said it was like the most ridiculous thing  That's where I was at  Yeah I was out in Boston  Yeah but was it a mall  Sounds like that Chris Farley character  A bunch of grown men  That happened  That was awesome  More a dress  More a dress  It was awesome  But yeah it was definitely beyond gay  It was a bunch of grown men  And we made sure  Yeah we went to like a Victoria's Secret  And just got the most insane  No where you just  You know I can get you in the smallest stuff 
[02:01:30]  That like a 13 year old will wear  Oh of course  And you're just bursting out of these dresses  And everything  It was awesome  You just gave him an idea  No  13 year old in Victoria's Secret  That's nice  Yeah  All right  Are we done with Zach Wilde do you think?  Anything else that comes to mind here guys?  Great  I think that's it  I think he was just really  You realize that he's very respectful towards Ozzy  So if Ozzy asked him to come back  And stop doing what he was doing  He'd go and do it  You know  In a second  Yeah  In a second  And he's doing  They're doing really well man 
[02:02:00]  Jimmy anything else you want us to play for that?  No it's fine man  It was just  He's just a fun  He's fun to have in the studio  Because he's just an animal  He's a fucking animal  We must save those  Go through the questions  Oh no we got tons more  We got the Bill Ward interview  The Tony Iommi interview  And then we got some more of the Bill Burr stuff  I got to say  Best thing I got  I got people doing  To do PSAs  That I want to hear  Yeah  All right  PSAs  Should we take a quick break?

[02:02:30]  Bill Ward gave us  Over 30 minutes total  Iommi  Who was the shortest  Gave us almost 10 minutes  And Geezer 17 minutes  These guys gave us  That's pretty nice  And I got a plea  From Sanctuary Records  Kevin  How do you say  Is it chairmate?  Cermonte  Cermonte  Fucking hooked this whole thing up  You can't get near Sabbath  On show days  And he used all of his powers  And all of his skills  All of his skills  And he was there for us  The whole time man  Kevin thank you so so much  For helping us at Sanctuary  It sounds like you had a great time

[02:06:30]  You can't even see through them  They are the thickest stockings  And they're made to look like  Make their legs look tan  None of their legs shows through those things  We've talked many times in the show  They got to update the uniforms and Hooters  What are they waiting for?

[02:08:00]  And they just keep going back to the church  I remember that when we did the OzFest thing  And they're eating vegetarian meals backstage  Tofu and drinking a little green tea  It's like what?  You're all padded up  They watch behind the music  They saw what not to do  Meanwhile you listen behind them  It's definitely a contrast  Soundtrack to hell is playing  There's something going on in the background  That just listen to the music  How well do people know you here?  So far it's been great  I mean we've done two signings

The War Within  The War Within's been out for a little while  We're going to be doing one more tour  After Auspest  And then working on a new record  So keep an eye out for that  That's awesome  We'll always keep us posted man  Thanks a lot  Thanks for that domestic violence drop  Alright cool man  Thank you  Very nice  Oh this shit is that funny  Don't beat up your fucking girlfriend  Yeah F-bombs  They're idiots  Save it for the bedroom  Save it for the bedroom  What?  Punch her in the bedroom 
[02:15:00]  Oh god damn is that funny  That's really good  We got one more here  From Peter from In Flames  Yeah  Hey what's up  It's Phil Burr  Open end for the show  You know that  Because you're listening to this shit  I'm with the bass player  From In Flames  Peter Iwers  Hey how was your set today man?  It's going to be fine  We haven't played yet  We haven't played yet?  Alright we need to start that again  So I don't look like  No fuck it  Just keep going man  I'm like a retarded  I got no reference there  So how do you think 
[02:15:30]  Your set's going to go tonight?  Are you looking forward  Are you on the main stage?  Yeah  Are you over there?  I think it's going to go great  I mean it's  We always put in 150%  And you know  It's a bit different  Playing from  Sitting down crowd  But still it's going to be great  So far all the shows  It's been amazing  So I'm pretty sure  Today we'll be as well  So you guys are like  Your vibe  You're more mellow  Melodic  Is that like how you guys are?  I think we're metal  It's hard to categorize us  Into one thing  Basically  Okay  Alright 
[02:16:00]  So you're not like  Iron Maiden meets  You're not like  Pitch movies and stuff  You're like  Iron Maiden meets  I guess we could say that  But it would be unfair  Probably to just  Categorize it into one  You know  I don't like that  We're metal bad  Alright  That's cool man  That's cool  How long have you guys been playing?  Oh a long time now  Since  I think it's like  Twelve years  Something  Like twelve years?  Out of everybody in the band  If you had to kill someone  Who would you kill?  Myself  You'd kill yourself?  The road's starting to get to you?  No no 
[02:16:30]  But I mean  It wouldn't be fair to the others  Otherwise  Choose one  I like this guy  This guy  I can tell  You're like the peacekeeper  In the band  Right?  You're like the mellow one  Listen man  We're also doing  This is kind of a side thing  We're kind of doing  This benefit  Somebody beat up  A special needs kid  In like Newark  And so  We just want you  To just say  You know  Just give a shout out  To the kids  So they know 
[02:17:00]  Not to beat up  Somebody with like  You know  Special needs  You know  So just  You know  Just say like  You know  Hey guys  You know  It's not cool  To beat up  Somebody  Just cause they're  Different or whatever  You know  Just you know  Just like a quick  Kind of like  Like a sound bite  And it's kind of weird  But throw a couple of  You know  Pucks in there  Just cause our fans  Are kind of retarded  You know what I mean  So you need to like  Just like rock and roll  You know  So just wing it  Hey guys  This is Peter from Inflames  You should treat everybody equally  And don't beat anybody up  Or do something bad to them  Just cause they're different

[02:24:30]  Our first anniversary show  Someone says it's nice  To see Colin Quinn getting work  You wouldn't have understood the taunts though  Something ironic  You know  I was doing a gig in Wildwood  Many years ago  I was probably three years in the business  And some guy was heckling me  And he just wrecked me  Really?  I talked to him after the show  And he's really a cool guy  And it was one of those guys  It was one of those fucking  Oh really?  Yeah  Some of them 
[02:25:00]  Like that guy  Pretty good at it  Doesn't matter how old the jokes are  It doesn't matter  You say it with the right attitude  It's going to work  It's going to piss people off  It's fantastic  Oh yeah that  If you're completely uninhibited  And you're not going to shut up  You'll win every time  Yeah  Very funny stuff  Bill you got to leave  Or are you staying?  I can hang until  A little bit after 10  Alright cool  We'll take a break  For my wacky sitcom audition  We'll continue with the OzFest audio  Was that it for you?  Wacky  I mean you did a great job  Yeah I think that was all I had  All?  I mean you gave us great stuff 
[02:25:30]  Gotta hear some more Jimmy  Yeah we got Jimmy on the way  Interviewing Bill Ward  And Tony Iommi  Stay there  Hey what's up  This is Bill Burrow  The redheaded white boy  From Chappelle's show  That's alright  I don't know who you are either  You're listening to  Opie and Anthony  XM202  The Opie and Anthony show  Alright let's get to some more  OzFest audio  With little Jimmy Norton  Bill Ward  Alright well we're sitting here  With Bill Ward  Who in my opinion  Most underrated drummer  In the history of music  I always wanted to ask you  Did you ever  Because guys like Bonham  And Moon  I mean they were great  But I always felt that you 
[02:26:00]  Were as good as they were  Up to par  And should have gotten  All that mentioned  But just because Zeppelin  Wasn't as dark as Sabbath  That they did  And how do you feel about that?  I'm okay  With the events  That have happened  I think that Moon  Was an exceptional drummer  Because he was kind of like  The one and only  The way that he was  And as far as I'm concerned  John Bonham wrote the book  On a lot of the music 
[02:26:30]  That we  A lot of the drum music  That we hear today  I thought his tempos  Were immaculate  They were totally on  If I had to do any comparisons  My tempos are not on at all  They're quite the opposite  For me  In fact  We were talking about this  The other day  In the sense that  Hold on a second  This is fantastic  He's actually agreeing  With everybody  That Jimmy was bashing  For the fact that  He wasn't getting  The recognition  And one of the most 
[02:27:00]  Underrated drummers  In music history  And he's agreeing  That he sucked  Compared to these other guys  But he  Bill's just a humble guy  That is fantastic  You know  Underrated drama  We got moon  No  My tempos aren't on  This guy's a genius  This guy wrote the book  I'm rated exactly  Where I should be rated  Bill's just humble  That's all it is  I love it  Even he's not  As hardcore as you are  No  He's not a bigger fan 
[02:27:30]  Of himself  As Jimmy is  Right  That's why I love  Listening to this stuff  Jimmy's a bigger fan  Of this guy  Than he is himself  I was  It was very  I was kind of  Making eye contact  The whole time  It was really  Bill's a  Bill's a sweet guy  They were all nice  But Bill Ward  Is one of the nicest guys  On earth  And a legend  And that accent  He's got that rock guy accent  But he's a gentleman  They're all gentlemen  There's no shitty rock attitude  Look at that  Soft spoken  And oh no  He's one of that  Just a fucking gentleman 
[02:28:00]  They're all  Yeah exactly  They're all very articulate  Very soft spoken  Very nice guys  And Bill was the one guy  That offered us all water  It's obvious that we're all drenched  And we all get in  We all get huge bottles of water  And Jimmy just watching him  He's fixated completely  On each guy  But Bill just happened to be the first  And it was the peak of panic  For poor Jimmy  Because it's obviously something  That's been building up  For years and years  And if you could find 500 different ways  To reiterate  You're so awesome 
[02:28:30]  That was basically  You rock  Yeah listen to that  As we move on  Well I've spoken to him before  Once the week before  So I kind of was more comfortable  With him than I was  With Tony  Who I was definitely  A little more nervous  Around Tony  Because he was not in a good mood  Because the bus was late  Jimmy  It's adorable  Let's go to Law  Law Jockey  Hey guys  Law Jockey  Shouldn't it be Law Jockey  But okay  Alright go ahead  This is Law Jockey  I just want to know  How Jimmy conducted the interview 
[02:29:00]  With Bill Worth  Cock in his mouth  The entire time  It wasn't easy  It didn't sound very clear  I did it while he was answering  I did it out of respect sir  Let's finish the clip  It's the other day  In the sense that  With early Sabbath  It's quite rugged  And quite  Kind of murky  And you know  There's incomplete  Drum rolls  And there's things like that  Oh that's great  Yeah  I suck  He basically  He's saying  I didn't complete drum rolls 
[02:29:30]  And he couldn't keep the tempo  How do you not love Bill?  How do you just not love that?  No arrogance  Should we play the next clip?  It says  Jim loves live version of War Pigs  Anything there?  More of the same  It's a lot of more of the same stuff  There's one  There's a part there  Where Jim talks about  What do you fear most?  Or is there something like  Jim you actually said at one point  I know when I suck  Is there something  At any point  Is there any time  That you really were  Oh yeah yeah yeah  When you stunk  Those were decent questions  Those were  So the War Pigs is whatever? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah War Pigs is kind of whatever  Yeah it was just  Like a fan question I had  Well I definitely want to hear this  Because track three  How do you feel about the fact  That everyone wants to be you?  That's great  Are you kidding me?  Not everyone  Maybe a few people here and there  Oh yeah  No a lot of them  Here's Jimmy  Talking to one of his heroes  That's the beauty  Of what you're listening to  Of course  It doesn't get any bigger  Than Black Sabbath  As far as Jimmy is concerned  You know it's funny  I love to watch  I watch some of the old stuff  From like the Hammersmith Odeon  From the 70's 
[02:30:30]  When you had like the long hair  And the beard  And just  It was always great to watch  You know Ozzy and Tony and Geezer  But I always liked  When they would show you  Because you were just there  Just shirtless  Just an animal  And it was just so great  To watch you  And I just wish  That there had been more footage  I could have watched you playing drums  For the entire thing man  And how does it feel to know  That everybody here  Every band here  Wants to be you  I mean you are your royalty  That's great  Holy shit  I didn't realize  I said shirtless  Shirtless  You super idiot  Man with all your  Body hair and beard 
[02:31:00]  That was a homo  Your hairy chest  Sweating  That is the gayest question ever  I didn't mean it to be  It's just when you watch  The old Ward stuff  He really just was  He looked like Zach Wilde  He was just a fucking savage  This guy was probably sitting here thinking  He would absolutely suck my cock  I could pull it out  And he would fucking suck it  Well let's go to the answer  Well it's very complimentary  I mean I just got  Finished talking with  The drummer from Shadows Fall 
[02:31:30]  Who won two great awards this year  For his drumming and his recording  You know the new Shadows Fall album  Or the work that they've been doing  I enjoy being around  You know the percussionists  And I do receive compliments from them  In the sense that they've  You know they've listened to me  And so on and so forth  But I see them  As very much individual people 
[02:32:00]  You know I think that  If I was able to influence them  In some way  Then that's an honor for me  You know I'm just like  Kind of  I try to be as humble as I can  About that  But the  I'm just happy to see them  Progressing into new  Fantastic areas of drumming  Which I think is like  We have so much good drummers  Sorry so many  Good drummers now  And so much good drumming  Now  I think there's been  An incredible development  In drumming sites 
[02:32:30]  Since the last  Over the last 40 years  You should have  Asked the question  And then gotten up  And slammed the door  And walked out  That old gag  Never a goofy question  For the boys  Ever  No  How do you feel  After 30 years  And still being a success  Anything there  I mean there's just  A lot of clips  Yeah I know  I mean again  It's very complimentary  You know it's  Jimmy just unloading  You know 30 some odd years  Of devotion to these guys  All at the same time  If anything 
[02:33:00]  We can listen to the questions  Did you ever think  I mean I'm sure you've asked this before  But when you guys started  I think was it 68  That here's  37 years later  You're still headlining  A major sold out festival  And there's still nobody  That can go on before you  That can make you guys  Not look great  You understand  There's nobody you guys  Can't follow  I mean are you amazed  That it's lasted this long  Yeah I am  I'm amazed  That I'm still alive  To be honest with you  It's kind of like  Any day above ground right  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:33:30]  I hear you  I was nodding  It's like  How can I describe this  And try and pack it into  Just a moment  A couple of minutes  I have a good hindsight  Of how things were for us before  Because that was the experience  Before I'm talking about  The 1970s  And now  Just in the most recent times  In the last seven years or so  It's almost like  Doing this  But in doing it  In a more of a grown up way  Or in a more experienced way 
[02:34:00]  Right  So a lot of the things  Which were possibly important  Say when I was 19 or 20  Which was sex, drugs and rock and roll  You know  I guess that's where it was at  At that point  These days  It's more like  Hmm  I wonder if I can achieve  That new drum lick  So  You know  And I mean  Back then  I was also wondering  If I could achieve  That new drum lick  But now  I guess  I wonder if I can achieve  That new drum lick  Kind of as presidents 
[02:34:30]  Over sex, drugs and rock and roll  I've never had the sex, drugs  And rock and roll  Unfortunately  It seems nice though  Well the sex, drugs  And rock and roll  For me  It seems nice  I have to offend you  One way jacket  You know  That didn't work out at all  But it took me a few years  To understand that  I love it  So it is  It's a different outlook  You know  Personally I think  That all of us  Tony and Geezer  And myself  And ours  I think we're  I think we're playing better  Now than we've ever played before  There's a much more  Of a maturity  And you know 
[02:35:00]  We've all just experienced  A lot more now  You know  That's great  According to Jim  The world's most underrated drummer  After 30 years  Is finally starting to practice  That's what I got out of that interview  He's finally started to  Maybe I'll work on a drum lick  Put the drugs down  Yeah  And pick up some sticks  During the time I'm not on stage  And maybe work some of this shit out  Maybe start working on my craft  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado 
[02:35:30]  Eric  Hey boys  Hey Jimmy  Yes  Did you take Bill's load  On your chin  Your chest  Or your back  I didn't  But I would have  Anywhere Mr. Ward  Wish to place it  And of course  We're getting quite a few of these  Jim Norton  Shit dick  I'm just chatting with Bill  About percussionists  Of course you are  Alright  Help me out here Steve  Compliments on the set list  Bill Ward's online blog  Your penmanship  On the set list  It might just be interesting  To hear the question 
[02:36:00]  That Jimmy presented  Because Jimmy's foaming at the mouth  Over the set list  Alright  Can I compliment you on the set list  I saw it  Can I compliment someone on the set list  You are just dripping  You are dripping in front of this guy  I'm a weasel  Oh wow  Can I compliment you on anything  The set list  Can I compliment you on the set list  I saw it  And I was  I mean  They won't be hearing this until tomorrow  But NIB  I almost shit when I heard you open 
[02:36:30]  With Symptom of the Universe  And I mean  Sleeping Village  I kind of wish you would have finished  Sleeping Village  What a great set list  Dirty women  Electric funeral  A lot of stuff I haven't seen live  Was that  You guys say  Let's just do something different  Well yeah  Well you came from the popular vote  Can I stop myself right there  This is why I should be decapitated  Because I just called Ozzy Oz  Because Bill called him Oz  Right before that  Oh my god  How did that get past me  I was so  I was concentrating so much  On the earlier part  I missed it  I gotta hear Jimmy call Ozzy Oz  A lot of stuff I haven't seen live 
[02:37:00]  Was that  You guys say  Let's just do something different  Jimmy thank you for pointing that out  That could have just gone by  Your pal Oz  Oz  When I said that  I realized I had just said it  And I just was like  So when you jot this down  And hand it to the big O  The Ozster  Well yeah  Well it came from the popular vote  In other words  Everybody listens to Black Sabbath  Because for a couple 
[02:37:30]  I mean last year  And the year before  Or the year before that  We were getting  You know  A lot of email  Which wasn't negative email at all  It was very positive  Saying hey  Play something different guys  You know  And of course  We don't have anything new  Right now at least  To play  So we tried to make sure  That we could at least  Try some different things  A little bit of some different things  To see if that might go better  With our audiences 
[02:38:00]  Oh  A little  Alluding to a new album  I don't know  I didn't ask them about a new album  Because they've been asked about it  A thousand times  Really  Yeah  Because they said something  We don't have anything new  To play right now  Right now yeah  Kind of sounded like  Maybe a new album  There was rumors about that  But again  I just figured  That they were sick  Of being asked that  Yeah  If anything  That was the one  And why ask that question  When you could further drool  Over the man  And ask him something  About his shoes perhaps  Okay  What else can we play  From the Bill Ward 
[02:38:30]  Track 7  Is a good one I think  Track 7  Alright  So we're going to go to  Okay this is a good one  Listen to this  Like I know when I'm awful  You know  Because the crowd is just staring at me  Do you have nights  Where you're just going  Jesus I am doing  Everything wrong tonight  Do you feel that  As a musician  Yeah  Oh yeah  Definitely  But you know  For me  You know  Just talking myself  As a percussionist  I get to try and recover from it 
[02:39:00]  By the next song  I think that's one of the toughest things  Is to  Okay move on  You know  Forget it  You screwed it up  You know you screwed it up  But now move on  And recover from that  So you just have to do  120% in the next song  That comes up  And I think that's  You know  That's not always easy  Because sometimes  You know  If you're tired  Or you didn't eat  Or you know  It could be all kinds  The sound might be poor  The sound quality might be poor  Because of the stage 
[02:39:30]  Or whatever it might be  You know  It's not always easy  To do a fast recovery  And get to your 120%  Sometimes  You have to  Just hang tough  And just get through the gig  You know  Very good  I don't know what to say  To be honest  That's  I think the next one  Where Jimmy says  Where Jimmy  Asked him about  Are there any  Things that you love 
[02:40:00]  That you absolutely loved  I think that was  The next question  Would you do a radio show  With me?  Oh no  Is that what the next one is?  Oh yeah  That was  That was a fairly  Sycophantic episode  Is it good?  I know you guys  I know you do radio  As well  And you have a very  Eclectic taste  And last time we spoke  About satellite radio  And I asked the head  Of programming  I don't know how long  You guys are on tour for  But I would love to do  A shift with you  I know you do your own show  But just a  Music shift  One time on XM  On the Boneyard  Which is their metal station  And the head of programming  Said he'd love to do it 
[02:40:30]  So I mean  When you come off tour  If you want to do it  Either in New York  Or D.C.  Or wherever it's easiest  I mean I would love to do it  And you can pick and play  Whatever you want  For the whole show  That sounds very cool  Yeah  I'd be open minded  To spin some things  Or do some things  Definitely  Yeah I appreciate that  No I'd say  I appreciate that  It's weird holding the mic  And moving it  I don't want to move it  While you're talking  And then I'm shaking  Because I'm nervous  Talking to you  But I am very happy  To be talking to you  Nervous talking to you  I'm happy to be talking to you  I'm talking to you  I got the mic 
[02:41:00]  And I'm talking to you  And I'm nervous  Talking to you  Wow  You little Nelly nervous  Oh you adorable  If you want to hang out  That's pretty much  Would you come over  To my house  And we'll play records  That's what that amounted to  Jimmy  You know  I know  You got a show  And I've already asked my mom  And she said it's okay  I forgot about that 
[02:41:30]  How could anyone not adore you  After this  I am awful  You do know you're a big star  In your own right  Right  I'm a zilter  He's a huge star  And he is just  The little nervous kid  Going back to being  Like 12 years old  13 years old  You know  You, me  Under the porch  Would you like to play  Monster Rain with me  Of all the songs  Records in your catalog  Is there anything  You would fix  Yeah  I'm just curious  It's just a fan question  Do you ever look back 
[02:42:00]  And again I know I do  You look back on something  That you feel great about  And then you look back on it  And you go  Oh  What the fuck was I thinking  That that was good  This interview  It's already out  Yeah I'm still doing that  I'm still doing that  With Sabbath stuff  There's one song  Who are you  Phenomenal  Phenomenal song  Of course it is  Of course it's phenomenal  How could it not be  Of course  Didn't the who do that song  They certainly did not  My 
[02:42:30]  Who  The part I hate  Is that I talk way too  Like I'm just too eager  And I put the microphone  In my mouth  I  I mean the microphone  That's why we love playing this  I so understand  It's a peek into your mind  How that is  It's so eager  To be there  And please  And do a good job  And you're nervous  And you're just  Over on the microphone  And  You know you're  So excited  You know you're a bigger fan  Than the actual band right  Um  I think that they kind of  Appreciate the fact  That I knew the band  You care so much more 
[02:43:00]  About Black Sabbath  Than you guys care about  Black Sabbath  Maybe  I mean I've met super fans  Before  And sometimes they remember  Stuff about you  That you're like  Oh yeah I guess  That was a part of me  Yeah  You don't remember  About yourself  But uh  I think they liked  The fact that it was  Somebody who was  Informed about what they do  Oh  Informed  Quite informed  Informed or obsessed  Well you know I mean  It's two different things  I adore Ozzy  He's my idol  But I mean it was like  I love these guys  And it wasn't like  It wasn't about just  Asking Ozzy questions  Through them  It was like  I wanted to know them too  This is like the guy  That runs the most  Hardcore Black Sabbath  Website ever  Who would never get the 
[02:43:30]  Opportunity to sit down  With these guys  And that's what it was like  Watching Jimmy interview  These guys  He had so much information  He's just letting it all  Come out at once  They probably like the fact  That it wasn't just  You know Ozzy  You know  Do you watch the Osbournes  Did you see  You know  All that shit  Right  I think I told him  The date and the album  Was released  You did  Is that the clip  That might  I might be in there  Now that's scary  To the artist  No no no  That's frightening  You might  And I  I don't  Just play that for a second  Because that might be the one  I backed up a little bit  Because I love how he says  That song is phenomenal 
[02:44:00]  Phenomenal  I just jump in  It is a great song  Can't because it's already out  Yeah I'm still doing that  I'm still doing that  With Sabbath stuff  There's one song  Who Are You  Phenomenal  Phenomenal song  I want to correct the drumming on it  In fact if I ever  If I ever  If I ever got a chance  I'd love to re-record the drumming on it  Because it didn't turn out quite like that  It's fantastic  There's nothing wrong  That's not Sabbath  Bloody Sabbath  There's nothing wrong with that song  That's just  You have to find something as an artist  There's nothing wrong  It's fantastic 
[02:44:30]  That's a good example of wanting to  You know  I mean  Alan's been since  That came in 30 years ago  74  And I'm still  And I'm still kind of  You know  Kind of like every once in a while  I kind of go  Man I wish we could re-record  I'm just  You know  Still not settled with that one  75  Things being unfinished  This is just  I'm loving this  I creep myself out  I'm going to show up at his house with a briefcase  Now I thought we could work on this stuff  You're like those Trekkies  You know  Just every little 
[02:45:00]  What do you want?  What do you want from me?  I can't give it to you  This is my pride and joy  You are Rupert Pumpkin  Oh I'm a fool  74  It's not 30 years  Let's go to Josh in Colorado  Josh  Hey guys  Love you guys  I want to mention that  That Norton interview  Sounded a lot like that  Chris Farley  Skit on Saturday Night Live  Where he gets to interview the guys  And he's like  Yeah did you guys ever play with  You were watching Osborne?  Yeah that was cool 
[02:45:30]  Somebody else pointed that out too  It certainly wasn't intentional  It was just  Of course not  I love you guys  It's so god damn funny Jimmy  It's just  The way you're asking these questions  The guy said  He would like to redo a song  And you told him no  Right  You pretty much told him no  Because you know better  You know better  No that song is phenomenal  Leave it alone  Perfect  And watching Jimmy in the room  And it's  You've got to understand that  There's not only is it me  Holding a microphone  But it's also 
[02:46:00]  Bill's assistant Walter  And Kevin from Sanctuary  And Adam from Yeager  In the room  And everybody's just this big grin  On their face  Because everybody knows  Exactly what's transpiring here  This is the chance of a lifetime  And they're all watching Jimmy  Just foam at the mouth  We were literally  I was  During Bill  You held the mic during one  I held it during Bill  Okay  You know  And it was just like shaking a little bit  And  But then I put my arm on the table  I'm like  Stop fucking moving stupid  And  We were at this teeny little table  In  Sabbath Village  In his trailer  So it was like  It was like being at  At a little kid's table 
[02:46:30]  In school  With  It was amazing  Did they tell him  That it was a  Make a wish foundation dream  For you or something  Because that must have been  What it looked like  This is great  You don't get to hear  Something like this  Every day  It's someone  That gets to interview  Their hero  It is very rare  There's no one bigger  Than Jim Norton  I want to stress that  Out there  Pick  Pick the one person  That you know  You're never going to meet  You're a huge fan of  Now imagine  Sitting in a room 
[02:47:00]  With that person  And talking to him  If I had the chance  To sit and talk  Back in the day  To like Kurt Cobain  I would have shit my pants  That would be  A little crazy  I would have lost my mind  I remember the first  Real  Celebrity I wanted to see  That I interviewed  Or actually  Just a passing  Hello  With a microphone  Because he was on his way  To the dressing room  Was Eddie Van Halen  I remember that moment  We were backstage  At the Worcester Centrum  I think it was  And we're broadcasting  From a table  Backstage area 
[02:47:30]  And there's kind of  A little commotion  Down the hall  And we look  And here comes  Eddie Van Halen  Walking down the hallway  And I got up  And it was around the time  Where he was having  His hip replacement surgery  Or something  So I just stood up  And I had to ask him  Something popped into my head  It was like  Eddie how's the hip doing  Are you going to be okay  For the show  And I put the mic  Out there  And he started talking  Into the mic  That I'm holding  I was staring into his face  Like a lover  Like a lover look  And I heard nothing he said 
[02:48:00]  All I was doing  Is looking and thinking  Oh my god  It's Eddie Van Halen  A foot away from me  I didn't hear  A word of his answer  And I must have looked  Like I was in love  It was so embarrassing  You just said something  That was really weird  That just hit me  And I didn't realize  This is one thing  I actually did right  I always do  I panic  And I zone out  And I'm like  Yeah  But that was one thing  I did during these interviews  And I listened  Listened  I couldn't believe  I actually was  With everything they were saying  It wasn't just  Bill Ward's mouth is opening 
[02:48:30]  Words  It's so hard to do  Just because you're looking  At the person  And you're like  Holy shit  That's the person I see  On this or TV  And that  I'm not saying I wasn't nervous  Or that there wasn't  Complete adoration  Because I was  And there was  I don't think you have to  Even comment on the adoration  Jimmy  I think it speaks for itself  I was trying to be unbiased  Didn't go well  Trying in the middle of the road  But yeah I did listen  You just said that  It's funny you said that  Yeah  Let's say hi to  Where are we going  Brian in North Carolina  Brian  Hey what's up  Hey  Hey  Tell little Jimmy  That he's like the  Fucking black Sabbath rain man 
[02:49:00]  74  Yeah  74  74  I just  It was nice to have Bill  Almost ask something  That I could be helpful with  I just wanted to be helpful  He doesn't care  What year it was released  What's up buddy  I said go watch up  Swapner  Alright thank you  Let's go to Staten Island  Jimmy what's up  Yo this is like  Worse than MTV Fanatic  Yeah it is like Fanatic  It's worse though  74  74  What the fuck  He wrote  He did the song  He thought it was phenomenal  I was helping my friend  He built  My buddy Bill 
[02:49:30]  Had a question  And what kind of friend am I  If I don't give the information  Right  If Anthony goes  Hey Jim what year did the Yankees do this  If I help  I tell him  You throw out the info  Bill asked a question  I thought about it  I just happened to mention it  He said 30 years  No it was 31 years  And I'll show you it was 31  By giving you the actual date  I didn't mean to do the actual date  The mic just kind of came up  And I just went  74  That is very funny  It's like oh  30 years ago  No  31 years  Like he's just rounding it off 
[02:50:00]  Obviously  30 years ago  74  Sean in Jersey  Hey guys good morning  Morning  Hey  Hey when Jimmy asked this guy  If he would come at the studio with him  And he says I'd be open minded to it  That's the equivalent of like  Get the fuck away  Yeah I'm open minded to that  Yeah we didn't pick up on that  Very good  No we  Well no I think he would want to do his  And I was making sure he understood  I wasn't trying to glom onto his radio show  And like hey can I do a show with you forever  I just wanted him to know  That just a shift would be a thrill  To bring you on next time 
[02:50:30]  And do a shift with you on the Boneyard  That's probably going to happen  I made that call to Eric Logan  On the way in  To see if it was okay to ask that  Do you actually think that would happen  Absolutely  I got an email from Bill's people  And it's going to happen  Wow  Bill Ward is  I'm not just saying he's Bill Ward  But he's a sweet guy man  And I think he's being completely  He's actually a completely honest guy  Could be losing Jimmy now  And there's a  Another radio show  Another radio show  There's a little thing he said  That turned out that he  Wanted to correct himself after  He grabbed us later  And goes  What I said before wasn't true  We'll play that  It was great  That's why I love him  Let's say hi to Dave 
[02:51:00]  Dave  Hey guys  How's it going  Hey  I wanted to kind of stick up for Jimmy  I think that's just testimony  Of how genuine you guys are  He represented  That would have been  Any one of us meatheads  Talking to that guy  I mean  We're all fans of somebody  We would have been the same way  I think that just shows  How genuine and honest  He really is  I mean  That's your show  And that's what separates you  There's no hack radio guy  In there trying to interview  And get this  Bullshit  You know  Come off  I'm trying out  You know 
[02:51:30]  He's just professional  But he's just honest  You know  I mean  I think he did a great job  You know  Thank you  But you did a great job  Thank you  Let's go to Orlando  O-Town  Check it in  O-Town  We're coming to get you brother  Alright  What's your question  Tough guy  What's up  Hey  What's up guys  Hey what's up guys  Hey buddy  First off  I'm a big fan of yours  Especially Little Jimmy  My idol for comedy  You angel  Yeah I just had a situation  Similar to Jimmy  You had a what  I met Corn and Snoop Dogg 
[02:52:00]  Last year  At the Project Revolution  Tour over in Tampa  Over there  At an after party  At a club  And you know  When I met  Jonathan Davis and Fieldy  And Snoop all together  And they were giving autographs  I even froze up  So I can understand  How it could be sometimes  Yeah man  You just  You don't want to misstep  But for some reason  It was almost like  This was so overwhelming  And so big  And so  It was almost like  Ozzy was  You know  Ozzy was obviously Ozzy  So we had him in studio  I froze on that one  And the guys  Picked up the slack 
[02:52:30]  And then I finally  Asked some questions  One on one  I may be more effective  Actually  I would probably listen more  As opposed to just watching  Open Antist talk  But I was happy  With at least the fact  That I was able to speak  With these guys  And when I felt  Like you know  Alright  You don't want to push it  You know  You wrap the interview up  And you know  Whatever  Let's say hi to George  George  Hey what's up guys  What's up George  You guys see that movie  The Incredibles  Of course  Well I have a three year old son  Who watches it all the time  And Jimmy reminds me of Buddy  I'm your biggest fan 
[02:53:00]  Crime fighting moves  Yeah we should get that clip  For Jimmy  It's the best  It's the best  And I could just see Billy going  Jimmy  Go home  Later boys  See ya man  Very good  One last clip  And then we'll say  The other interviews  For tomorrow or something  Your exclusive interview  With Tony Iommi  Tomorrow on the program  Oh  More of the same  I'm sure  Oh no  I was  And then geezer butler  As well  But first  The last question  You got to ask  Bill Ward  Is there anything 
[02:53:30]  You look at  When you look back  And there has to be  So many songs  But is there one song  When you look back  On and you go  That was  A fucking masterpiece  That I pulled off  Were you just so proud  Of what you did  More so than the other stuff  Well I like a lot  Of the  I like a lot  Of the work  That I did  On  Our masters of reality  I really liked that album  And I think that  I think that one  Is kind of a peak  Where it shows  It shows the first  Five years  Of Black Sabbath  Even though that was  The third album  The band had been  Playing since 68 
[02:54:00]  You know so  Um  It was kind of  A time when  It had  There were so many  Tours under our belts  At that point  You know  And we'd already  Recorded two other  Albums at the time  So I think that  That album was a  Really good album  In the sense that  It captured  A time  When the band  Were doing  Everything together  Literally  Eating together  Sleeping together  And you know  Playing on the road  Constantly  Was that back in the days  Of four guys on one bus 
[02:54:30]  Oh four guys in one bed  Sometimes man  You know we were still  Sharing rooms  I shared the room  With Ozzy of course  You know  But you can't have  All the luck  You know what I mean  But uh  That's  Masters of reality  I rather like  Some of the things  That I played on  That one  I think I actually  Wanted  I quoted  What  The songs that they  Did off master reality  I kind of realized  I was a psychopath  Really  Yeah like  What's the next question  If it was it  Okay  For this one  There's one part  Where I'm like 
[02:55:00]  Yeah well you guys  Because of the set list  And I name all four songs  Off master reality  That they're doing  For the set list  And I kind of  Irritated myself  Wow yeah  Why didn't Steve give us that  That's the stuff  We want to hear  I don't know  That was very good  Very good  Ah you're getting  Rave reviews there  Jimmy Frank  In the Poconos  Hey what's up guys  Can you hear me  Yeah go ahead Frank  Yeah I just wanted to say  You know like all the  Bullshitting and you know  The teasing Jimmy aside  And all  I gotta say  This really is like  A refreshing  For a change  A refreshing  Musician interview 
[02:55:30]  Like  Things like Jimmy said  Instead of  You know he wanted to  Ask him if they were  Coming up with a new  Studio album  Like every other  Interviewer would  Instead of you know  Busting balls  He got into the more  You know meat of the  Conversation which people  Want to hear about  It's refreshing  Thank you man  Alright there you have it  Thanks Frank  Okay guys  Are these all going up  On the website  Yeah we'll put the  Entire interviews up  That'd be great yeah  And you can download  And hear every  Every bit of it  Every bit of  Jimmy just  Interviewing his heroes  What's that Steve 
[02:56:00]  This is um  This is a clip of  Bill catching up  With us afterwards  And correcting  Something he said  I'm not sure  Oh it's like a one minute  What happened was this  We were talking  We were talking about  Something  Well he um  Corrected his clip  We had been talking  About the set list  I was talking  This is probably  Where I named the songs  Off Master of Reality  If anybody's curious  It was Children of the Grave  Into the Void  After Forever  And um  Sweet Leaf  And um  We were discussing that  And he said  We might not do  Into the Void tonight  For no reason  He said sometimes  We just shorten up 
[02:56:30]  The set list a little bit  He kind of just said  No we might not do it tonight  I'm not too sure  We might not  And then we kept going  And an hour later  We see him  And he remembered our names  He goes  Jim, Steve  And he calls us over  And just  This is why I love this guy  Okay once again  We're with the great Bill Ward  We are outside here  In a Sabbath village  At Ozfest  Yeah I just wanted to  Earlier on in the interview  We were talking about  Into the Void  And I happened to mention  That it was  We probably might not  Be playing that  And there's no reason  For that  But I  That was bullshit 
[02:57:00]  We have a reason  For not playing  Into the Void tonight  So  Because we're doing  Back to back gigs  We tend to  Tighten up the show  A little bit  You know  And it works out  A little bit better  For the band  So  So that's what we  That's what's going on  So Into the Void  Is coming out  It's basically just  A timing decision  As a matter of fact  Tonight  I don't know  If we're actually  Playing it tonight  We might actually  Play it tonight  But on the last  Two shows this weekend  That just went  We didn't actually play  So hopefully  We will be reinstating 
[02:57:30]  Into the show  Within the next  Couple of shows  Thank you Bill  You're the greatest  I just want to  Clean that up  What I said earlier  Was not correct  Do we have a shirt  For Bill too?  We certainly do  Is that the  Give me the XM shirt  Bill gets a shirt  Thank you  Alright  Thank you very much  I appreciate that  Thanks again Bill  Alright  Thanks Bill  Wow  Okay  First of all  What I come away with  From that clip  Is he's as crazy  As you are  That he felt compelled 
[02:58:00]  To come back to you  And tell you  About that song  There's a whole  OCD thing  Happening there  It's crazy  He's just an honest guy  He couldn't allow  That incomplete answer  Insane  Of course  Maybe a little crazy  A little crazy  Jim, Jim, Steve  I've got to tell you  No  We're playing the song  Or we might not play  Like I still don't know  If they're playing the song  Or not  No, it was about the reasoning  What he was saying was  Like the first time  The reason he gave  Like was like  I'm not  No reason  Like I said  Either the boy  He goes  We're not going to play  After tonight  No reason  But then later he goes  No, no, no  That wasn't true  There was a reason  We tried to tighten up  The shows on back to back days 
[02:58:30]  And I kind of  I like the fact  That he just wanted  To clarify that  And make sure  It was honest  And not a lie  It's a piece of information  That everybody  I think  A casual person like myself  Would have completely bypassed  But him  But Jimmy and Bill  Both obsessed completely over it  And you could tell it  No, you know what happened  He was hanging out  With somebody  A few yards away  Going  There's a fucking lunatic  I was talking to earlier  Which one?  That guy right over there  Who, the guy  No, no  There's a fucking lunatic  Over there  The guy to the right  No, that  Look  I'll go up and talk to him  That's a fucking madman 
[02:59:00]  I love it  Yeah  Great  I can't wait for tomorrow  A complete fan  Talking to one of his heroes  And they were  They were the most genuine guy  And they did actually  Talk a little bit  About having to do certain songs  Because Ozzy  You know  Yeah, you gotta pace him  Well, yeah  The notes  Are a little different  Right  Yeah, the guy's  No kid anymore  Absolutely  All right  Kevin in Salt Lake  What's up, Kevin? 
[02:59:30]  Kevin!  Yo!  Let's go  Wind tongue  Hey, I was just wondering  How many times  Did Jimmy come in his shorts  And if he's gonna frame  Those shorts  That he was coming in  When he threw an interview  All right, sir  Four  Frame his jizz  Staying short  The answer is four  Joe in Arizona  Hey, this is Joe  Hi, Joe  You're in Arizona  Yeah, I'm in Phoenix, Arizona  Right  Hey, I love you guys  The show, man  Thank you  Hey, I wanna hear  The part of Jimmy's interview  Where he says  I'm totally crying 
[03:00:00]  Yes, I'm absolutely crying  I think a part of the  Geezer interview  He does actually make  Reference to  Weeping  I'm absolutely crying  I was in the same room  It was amazing  Pale Rider from Wackbag  What's up, boys?  I gotta ask you  What's more disturbing?  The fact that Jimmy knew  That the album came out  In 74  Or that Jimmy was only  Five years old  When that album came out  I know  74  I was five  Yes  We're five  I was six  Enough for nothing  Him and Bill Weir 
[03:00:30]  Have a lot in common  When Bill was talking  About drumming tempos  And all that before  He's jumping like  84 times in a minute  I mean  Between him and Jimmy's dress  I suck  Relatable  He jumped  He was going somewhere  And he just realized  It was spinning out of control  All right, Jason  In Virginia Beach  Hey, fellas  How you doing?  Hey  Back in 97 or 98  I've been a big  Dale Earnhardt fan  Since I was  You know, a little kid  God dang  And I had an opportunity  To meet him  At like a meet and greet  With like 20 people  It was me and my wife 
[03:01:00]  And we'd get up  To the table  And I was so starstruck  The only damn thing  I could say to him  Is I like you  Oh, that's bad  Oh, how embarrassing  Just a look on his face  And my wife's face  Just totally  Just embarrassed  The hell out of me  I like you  It's like a childlike  A childhood thing, man  It's like you're not speaking  From an adult  A man meeting a man  Perspective  You're speaking  Like you're  It's like looking at  It's like looking at a clown 
[03:01:30]  When you're a Ringling Brothers  Like to actually talk  To that person  When you're four or five  That's the same vibe  Something just happens  In your brain  He's not a hero of mine  But I told the Peter Jennings story  I see him in Central Park  I'm sitting on a bench  Just hanging out  And he's fighting  That lung cancer  And I saw him  With his kids  Walking in the park  And this is three  Four months ago  And I gotta tell you  He looked awful  And I personally  Don't think it looks good  For Mr. Jennings  Dr. Hughes  Thank you for that diagnosis  I'm sure he'll be thrilled  And so  I'm thinking  Here's my moment 
[03:02:00]  To say something  To Peter Jennings  And I pointed  To my cancer bracelet  That I wear  For Brother Weez  And I  The only thing  I could think of  Was  Good luck, bro  Good luck, bro  That's what came out of my mouth  That's what came out of my mouth  He's playing a pickup game  And I saw him coming for  Probably 100 yards  And I'm like  You gotta say something  It's Peter Jennings  The fight of his life  There's nothing you can say  I support this cancer thing  Everyone does  And I got my cancer bracelet  So I'm like  What are you gonna say to Peter Jennings  To make him  Nothing  Maybe smile inside a little bit 
[03:02:30]  Maybe make his day  A little better than it is  Nothing  And the best I could come up with  On the spot was  A thumbs up  And a good luck, bro  Good luck, bro  There's nothing you can say  To a celebrity on the street  That sounds cool  New  Hip  Or anything they haven't heard before  Most of it sounds ridiculous  Because you're freaking out  But I think the best thing  You could just say  Is a recognition of  Hey man  I love your work  Or if they have something  Recent out 
[03:03:00]  Say I caught this  And it's great  In passing  You're not gonna stop  You're not gonna get a relationship  With this person  You're not gonna  It's one of those moments  That  And it's so hard  To come off like  It's kind of casual  You're usually like  Love  Loved you  And you look like an idiot  And  It's very hard to do  So a lot of times  You just look  And walk by  And tell your friends  You saw that person  That's it  Great you  What?  Well the dude that played 
[03:03:30]  Ned Ryerson  Was living in my neighborhood  For a while  Ned Ryerson  From Groundhogs  This day  And I saw him coming  So I thought I'd be witty  And I was like  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  I'm like he hasn't heard that  I sure as heck fire  Remember you  Right  The look on his face  I think he wanted  Just to strangle me  And you know  There's always gotta be  One buzz kill in life  And I gotta just  Really quick address  The post  A guy named  Dan Aquilante  Uh oh  I see the headline  And I'm not even 
[03:04:00]  Getting close to Jimmy  Cause I know what this guy is  I know what he's  Just one of these  Rolling Stone magazine  Well let's try to get him  On the air  It's a New York paper  Isn't it?  Too hip for the room  I wanna spit in his face  He gave  He trashed  Sabbath  Or you know  Where Ozzy created  Horror with his  Cringe inducing vocals  Ozzy sounded  Phenomenal  And everyone said  He sounded phenomenal  The only time he cracked  Was on the last song  And then when I saw him  Was the last two songs  Cause he had been screaming  The whole show  In between songs  You know  He does 
[03:04:30]  He's Ozzy  He sounded phenomenal  It's the best I've ever  Heard him sound  Because I think he's  Sober now  And he's healthy  And this guy  Is just probably  One of these jerk offs  Who likes certain types  Of classic rock  And he didn't like it  And the Daily News  Gave it a phenomenal review  They were like  Iron Maiden, Sabbath  That's what a show is  They give you everything  They're not too hip  For the room  They're just  And this motherfucker  Dan Aquilante  You're just  You're a cocksucker  And you're the type  That just goes out  And trashes something like this  Because you think  You're too hip  And that this is what you do  Land of Oz 
[03:05:00]  It says  Instead of band of Oz  Or land of Oz  Land of Oz  That's even a reach  He works in the afternoons  You should call him  And record it  On the radio tomorrow  Can we set that up?  I'm serious  Cause I'll probably talk to you  And you can call him from home  And you have a little discussion about it  And bring him the tape  The two were best early  When they roasted  When they roasted war pigs  Later hitting the same kind of high  For Iron Man and Black Sabbath  You're glad you liked war pigs  And Iron Man  Sorry you didn't like  Dirty women or electric  Funeral  You're not a real fan  You're some jerk off  In comfortable slacks 
[03:05:30]  Who shows up  And writes for a paper  And gets free tickets  And you're the fucking worst  When we saw the Stones  Do that press conference  It was all you  Jerk offs  In the business  That sat there  In the front row  With your arms folded  Kind of tapping your feet  Cause you're too hip  To enjoy the music  Everybody else loved the fact  The Stones came out  Fucking Mick Jagger  Thirty feet from you  Singing for free  And you scumbags  In the business  All sat there  With your fucking legs  Crossed  Like a bunch of  Coffee clutch faggots  Too cool  Hey I review the music man  I can't enjoy it  What is this? 
[03:06:00]  I'm beyond enjoying it  It's music man  Just studying them  As much as they can  To find that one thing  They can pick apart  Yeah  Instead of just sitting there  And enjoying it  For the moment it was  And I've seen Ozzy  Not be up to par  In all the years I've seen  And there's been times  Where he wasn't good  Cause he was whatever  Please  He's gone through all these phases  He was phenomenal this time  And I'm not just saying  That as a bias fan  The band was really tight  You're a bias fan  That's what annoys me  Well I am at times  But just Dan Aqualante  From the Post  Just a fuck  That's what you are  You gotta call him later  You're a fuck 
[03:06:30]  Yeah  Give him a ring  Give him a ring off air  Tell him you're recording  For the show  And have a little conversation  With the guy  I think that would be  Great radio  Let's say hi to Sally  In Illinois  Hi  Hi  Jimmy when you were done  With all your interviewing  Did you go home  And flop on your bed  And put your headphones on  And shut your eyes  And play all the songs  You had discussed  No  What I actually did  When I went home  Like a teenage guru  Cause I had  I had Bill, Tony, and Gieser  Sign the pictures  I had with them  And Bill actually loved  The picture of he and I together  He's like  Send me a copy of that 
[03:07:00]  So I'm going to  They all signed  The pictures  And I took them home  And the first thing I did  Was wash out my frames  And put my pictures  In my frames  So they wouldn't be damaged  I'd wash your frames  Well my glass frames  They had been dusty  From moving  Oh right  I put my pictures  In the frames  Very responsible of you  Big boy  That's really bizarre  Ben in ND  Is it Ben in North Dakota?  Yes sir  What's up Ben?  Hey you guys  Ever heard of Dream Theater? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah  I met  Them guys are just my idols  And I met them  About a year ago  I was so nervous  Meeting a guitar player  That I went up to him  I asked him something  About the guitar  And I said  Well hey  I'm in the Air Force  And I'm here to protect you  How gay is this?  Your brain just stops working  In those situations  I know  I was so embarrassed  And I'm meeting me again  For a meet and greet  In a week  Yeah  I just hope he doesn't remember me  Look at this fucking  This guy  This awkward  I hope this guy is killed 
[03:08:00]  In a car accident  He said  We're the Iron Boys  Iron Maiden  We're often overpowering  With their three guitar crunch  Sabbath is extremely lean  Totally depending on  Iomi's concise  Yet powerful fret work  Iomi's rhythm based style  Was supported by  Fat old Bill Ward's  Tremendous drumming  Oh  Why?  You fucking  Rolling Stone magazine  Loving  Jerk off  That is not necessary  I'd like to fucking 
[03:08:30]  Bite your neck  For your lack of  Your completely biased review  I guarantee  You have faggoty music taste  I'd love to see his iPod  Jimmy would kill for Sabbath  I know  This makes me sick  It's a disingenuous review  Just nod and agree  It's a disingenuous review  Yes  Yes  Why?  The paper the day before  Maiden, Sabbath  And now all of a sudden  Sabbath was awful  But you like Maiden  They have eleven musicians  Fat  Old  It's fucking  It's sickening 
[03:09:00]  For a drummer to be able  To do what he's doing  At his age  It's just  I'd like to stab  This cocksucker  Right in his eye  With a pen  Sal makes a good point  On the line here  Exploring all the angles  Of Jimmy's obsession  Go ahead Sal  Hi fellas  Listen Jimmy  Is it possible  For someone to not  Like the same thing you do?  Absolutely dude  Absolutely  Okay  So you say  It's a biased opinion  Perhaps your opinion  Slightly biased  Because your head  Is up their ass  First of all  Stop talking  Your little lilt dude  Maybe because  I'll sound smarter  If I talk like this  I've admitted  Bill 
[03:09:30]  Shut up  I've admitted  That I'm biased  I'm honest about it  I am not a reporter  Supposedly doing something  Unbiased  Yes  Asterisk  This is an editorial  I understand that  But I am biased  I admit I'm biased  Okay  So what's disingenuous  About a person's opinion?  Because he's trashing them  And Ozzy sounded good  And everybody  He doesn't like them  He doesn't like them  Then why not just say  I don't like Black Sabbath  Instead of coming off  Like you're giving an honest review  And saying that they didn't sound good  When Ozzy sounded better this time  Than he has in years  Because he's healthier  Maybe that's honest to him 
[03:10:00]  It's not honest to him  It can't be honest to him  It can't be because  It differs from your liking  No because it differs  From what everybody  I've talked to has said  He's a jizz bag  Ben we gotta get this guy  In the air now  Therefore Ozzy was great  That's ridiculous  Ozzy sounded good  He just did dude  To you he sounded good  I know when he sounds bad  I've seen him enough times  Because you're a fan  If this guy isn't a fan  Then what the fuck is he doing  Reviewing something in a newspaper  If he can't be unbiased  Who says he's biased  Just because he didn't like the guy  Everybody said it 
[03:10:30]  And you just did stupid  And I did  He's biased  I didn't say he was biased  You said if he doesn't like Black Sabbath  That means he's biased  Idiot  Okay so that's his opinion  Hey I'm here to write  Then he shouldn't be fucking reviewing something  If he doesn't like Sabbath going in  He can't review them unbiased  Why the fuck is he doing a review  Because that's what he does  He gets paid to write things that he thinks of  I go to see a movie  And I'm a reviewer  I tell you it stinks  That's my job  You're not supposed to do that  If you're a critic  You're supposed to give an unbiased opinion  On the performance 
[03:11:00]  Okay so if I go into a movie  And I say  Here's my unbiased opinion  I didn't like this and this  Well there you go  I didn't like it  I didn't think it was good  He's full of shit  He's full of shit  Because it doesn't match with your theory  It doesn't match with what anybody said  Who saw it  Who was there who saw it?  Fans  A bunch of people  No people from the station  People who work for  Billy Burr saw them  He was blown away  Billy Burr's great by the way  Yeah he is very funny  But anyway  Oh that's biased  Let's not talk about Billy Burr 
[03:11:30]  That's biased  I like Billy Burr  My opinion is  Billy Burr's good  Exactly  But you know  Let me give you an example  There are times  Where I'll watch something  And I don't think it's particularly funny  And yet I still understand  That it's funny  And I recognize  That it's funny  Because I know my craft well enough  You understand what I mean  Okay  But isn't it okay to go to someone  You know what  I saw this  But I didn't like it  Yes  That's your opinion  It absolutely is  Let me finish dude  Let me finish answering your question  But if I go  And I disingenuously say  Yeah but the joke structure sucked 
[03:12:00]  Or this and that sucked  You understand  Greg Proofs is a guy  Who I disagree with politically  On every level  I don't watch Greg Proofs  But I know Greg Proofs  Is a really funny comic  He's a great comic  I watch him  I love him  So for me to go  Yeah I'm not a fan  Because I don't agree with him  Is one thing  But for me to come off  Like I'm fucking giving  An unbiased opinion  And then start critiquing  Well his joke structure was weak  And the punch lines were soft  That's where the bullshit comes in  That's what I'm talking about  With this review  I'm not talking about  Having a personal dislike  Of Black Sabbath 
[03:12:30]  That's acceptable  But don't come off  Like you're fucking unbiased  Because that's what he's doing  Yeah  You're an angry little fellow  I'm not an angry fellow  I just don't like bullshit like that  Alright let's go to Mike  Mike  I don't like  I'm a brand new  XM subscriber  And I really enjoy your show  We don't give a shit  You're biased  I am biased  Stop kissing our ass  And just listen  Okay  Listen  Dan Aquilante  I'm in Houston  But Dan Aquilante  Is a very well respected 
[03:13:00]  Rock critic  Who's been writing  For a long time  He has written  Very favorable things  About Black Sabbath  In the past  I don't care  I believe he supported  Their induction  Into the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  If he felt the show  Was weak  It's because  He's got a frame  Of reference  In which he's probably  Seen them  25 other times  And written about them  10 other times  First of all  And the man knows  What he's talking about  And if his opinion  Differs  So be it  But he's not 
[03:13:30]  Writing it  Because he hates them  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  I don't know  I don't know  What you're saying  Is true  I've never read  Anything by this  Jackal  I know Ben  Was saying  That he has  Trashed things  That were obviously  Good before  That's what I was  Going to say  Well he  Hold on  Dude  Hold on  Hold on  No no  He's hated  By a lot of people  First of all  I went to an  STP show  It was right after  Lane Staley died  And they opened up  With a Pink Floyd song  It was the best  STP show  I'd ever seen  He trashed them  The next day  And they were saying  It was terrible  They sounded great  That was at 
[03:14:00]  Hammerstein Ballroom  And then I remember  Reading about  How Dave Matthews  He gave Dave Matthews  A bad review once  So Dave Matthews  Wouldn't even give him  Tickets to concerts  And I've read  There's been like  Three or four times  I've gone to shows  That he's reviewed  That he's trashed  That I thought were great  There's been like once  That I've gone to a show  That he said was good  That was good  So I  We gotta get Dan on the phone  And dude as a fan  This would make for some  Great radio  He's not a  He's not quote unquote  A fan  I am talking about  He's a very well  Respected critic  I don't care  A lot of well respected critics  Rolling Stone 
[03:14:30]  Is a well respected  Rock magazine  And I think it stinks  It stinks  It's never represented  Anything I liked in music  The fact  Dude  This is  That's because  You're a little too young  I'm 37 you idiot  No  No no  No I'm not 37  You're 10 years younger  Than I am  Alright good  So you're a fucking middle age  You have no idea  What you're talking about  No  Yes I do  I have a teenage daughter  Good  You know  You know what though dude  I mean this guy's  Gonna write an article 
[03:15:00]  It's up to him  There's no reason  To get angry  Everyone has opinions  And there's nothing wrong  With having opinions  That's different than mine  I'm all for it  And I'm all for everybody  Just kind of feeling good  47 years young  This guy's a fucking cunt  He's a biased cunt  And I know what he's doing  Well you know what  Rolling Stone has been around  For a long time  They've helped a lot of bands  They help a lot of people  Get where they gotta go  And that's the important thing  In music  Everybody's feeling good  And dancing  But you know what  Rolling Stone only helps  Fucking alternative  Faggotty bands  Owen Wilson  And Vince Vaughn  Are on the cover 
[03:15:30]  Of Rolling Stone  Where the fuck  Is Black Sabbath  They've never been on the cover  You're gonna tell me  Like you know  All the fucking stuff  They've done  They never deserve  The Rolling Stone cover  But then again  If he wrote in Houston  And he's now writing here  And a lot of people  Respect him  He's probably been  All over the country  This is a guy  Who just reaches  A lot of people  He's got an opinion  And it differs than mine  And that's okay  I hope he's killed  In a drunk driving wreck  On the way to his  Daughter's fucking wedding  I hate him  The O.P. and Anthony program  Or that stupid XM  Stinger they do 
[03:16:00]  What is it?  XM  XM 202  The O.P. and Anthony show  Ah brother we's in studio  For the  Restart that  We don't need the boss  Sounding like a clumsy ass  Brother we's in studio  Thank you Jimmy  Hopefully they  Did what you said  I hope so too  Because that muffled  Little thing you just did 
[03:16:30]  Made you sound unprofessional  Like a second rate fool  But knowing the asses  That worked for us  I'm sure  They looped it  You just heard that  Of course you did  I wouldn't know  Because I'm on vacation  Anthony's on vacation  Little Jimmy's on vacation  Ben's been on vacation  Since October of 2004  He was working at Sirius  And then the fucking  Ship came in  And kicked his little  Stupid feet up on the deck  And hasn't done a  God damn thing since  My hero came by  And said hi  Brother we's 
[03:17:00]  He's my mentor  In the business  And well  We had some fun  When he stopped by  The program  Check it out  Here's Opie and Anthony  When they're not awful  Okay terrific  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony  No more of that  It's bad for you  And we're back  With the Opie and Anthony  Program  The only virus  Spreading across America 
[03:17:30]  Thanks to XM  Satellite Radio  Jim Norton's gonna leave  In a few minutes here  Oh Jimmy  Gotta get a procedure done  Yeah  He's all scared  And I'm laughing at you now  Because Brother Weez  Is in the studio  He can tell you all  About procedures  Endoscopy  I had him  Piece of cake  Don't be scared at all  People shouldn't be scared  My wife  Oh endoscopy  Is that the tushy?  No  Throat  I had both of them  My wife  Check this out  My wife was sitting with me  When I had the endoscopy  Because  I'm 
[03:18:00]  People know me  That's down the throat  All the way down  Right  But they give you the  Versed  Anthony knows about  Versed  Come on  Oh good drugs  It's a drug  Supposedly it just  Makes you forget  But  And actually you're sleeping  But  They let my wife  Come in the room  While they were doing it  And I woke up  In the middle of it  With the thing  All the way down my throat  But  Don't even be worried  She was right in my face  I woke up  She says  Honey it's almost done  Which it wasn't  And the guy hit me  With another piece of drip  Back to sleep  It's nothing bro 
[03:18:30]  Don't worry about it  How long does it take?  What's the difference?  You see it  Good point  How long does it take?  About 40 minutes  Yeah but to you  You just shut your eyes  And then you open them up  And you're done  They're done  You don't even know what happened  It's like time travel  You really going  You got stomach problems bro?  I've had bad like air hunger  Which I think is anxiety  But I'm getting every possibility checked  Wait what's air hunger?  I've never heard it in my life  I was running out of air on stage  What?  I told you I was running out of air on stage  Like it was  But it's called air hunger?  That's the point  When you feel like you can take a breath  But there's something restricting your lungs 
[03:19:00]  You're having anxiety  That's anxiety  I think you're right  But I'm checking everything out  I'm checking esophagus  I want everything checked  So I know  It's a shame you're an addict  Drugs would do you so well  I was just going to tell the brother  That the one thing  I have a lot of anxiety also  And I have a lot of the same symptoms you get  But what I do is  Like when I'm getting my fake heart attack  Or if I've got air hunger  I pop me a couple of magic vitamin X  Xanax  And if I  If the symptom is gone  Then I know it's a bunch of crap  I'm not really sick  And if you do that 
[03:19:30]  Then you'll know  And then the next time I get my fake heart attack  I know it's fake  And I plow through it  I can't take any drugs  I'm an addict  I can't do it  If I take drugs I'll want to  So now you're getting stuff stuck down your throat  And everything  If I go back to drugs  I'll have stuff stuck down my throat too in jail  You can use without going to jail  He's the real deal  He stopped drinking at what?  17?  18  He blew his load at 18  18 years old  Can you imagine?  Who reaches bottom at that age?  Bro you haven't had nothing since you were 18? 
[03:20:00]  February 1st of 87  How do you know you can't have a nice Xanax?  How are you going to go through life with anxiety  And you can't eat a Xanax?  Just because it comes out  Like the personality is the same  And the fact that if I start masturbating at the computer  Six hours later  Sometimes I'm still there with a backache  And I haven't come  I'm like  You really want to get away from yourself?  Listen  You know we talk about this where I'm from  And I don't want to hurt a guy that's an addict  But I don't believe a lot of this crap  Especially when you were  You know at 18 years old  You had the alcohol and drug problem 
[03:20:30]  I mean you know  You're going to miss a lot of painkillers  That your body needs  Yeah  Well a painkiller like Xanax  I can't  If it's  I'm on a monitor  Like if I get surgery  And I have to have something  Right  That's different  It's all motives  If my motive is to get high  It's wrong  What about Vicodin?  I would only take that after  I love Vicodin  Real pain  I had Vicodin for my tooth  And I was  I started getting to the point where  The first day I'm counting  I'm going  I only have 18 left  You're like  You take one  After the first one  I'm counting  Shit 
[03:21:00]  I'm going to be out of these soon  And it feels legit  Because you were prescribed  Right  So you're like  Hey I'm supposed to do all 18  Anthony's shuffling chips on here  I know  I got busted for that on my joint  They make me take them  I started the shuffling thing  You start getting complaints  Dude stop with the fucking chips  He's going to Atlantic City  Right after the show  Borgata  I was just watching your old lady  She's doing fine  I got  I got the bankroll  How would you bring it?  This nine large  Jesus  What are you going to play?  What are you going to play? 
[03:21:30]  I usually play three card poker  Are you kidding me?  No you know something?  I do very well on that stupid game  Bro it's a sucker game  Do not do it  No I  You know something?  I got a system  How do you think he made that 9G?  I went  Three card poker?  That's what I made last time  Yes  That's all the money I made last time I went  I'm going back with what I won  I never put it in the bank  I kept it out  And now I'm going back to give it back to them  Now do you play hold'em like you're all 80 or not?  Yeah  Then play hold'em  And then you're playing other people  Instead of the house  When you play three card hold'em  They're ripping your ass off  And you got lucky 
[03:22:00]  No I know I got lucky  I understand that  I love hold'em  I love just hold'em  With that nine grand  That's a huge bank  It certainly is  You can go down there and play 81-60  Yeah  Oh my god  What's 81-60?  Huge game  But he can play 20-40 hold'em  Which is a nice level hold'em  Yeah  And sit there all day  And if he's good  Probably win some money  You know what it is though?  I don't like to commit to that much time sometimes  A lot of time  You know  Because we like hanging out  And my chick does very good at three card poker too 
[03:22:30]  Oh she's going to play that  Now she's online on party poker  And you know  For a while  She was giving me a little bit of shit  At home  Because I wasn't listening to anything  I'm just playing, playing, playing  And now I get home  And I hear her going  Son of a bitch  A straight  Oh yeah  And I was like  Oh okay  It's over Johnny  Oh yeah  She's a good player  I was watching  Yeah she's really good  Very good player  Is she up?  Yeah  No well she was in a little tournament  And she was down to about four people  And she was playing good poker  Yeah  I was watching  And then she said she was going to the Borgata  Yeah  Man am I jealous 
[03:23:00]  It's uh  I love going down there  You're going to see my brother  He's playing down there this weekend  And we're seeing Tom Jones tonight  What's his band now?  He's got a U2 band  He's a dude I met with Good Rats  Yeah he was playing with the Good Rats for a while  For a while  Yeah in Rochester  Good Rats are huge in Rochester  And now he's playing in a  God damn  Doing better than he ever has  In a U2 tribute band  And they're playing  The guy plays U2 tribute  That's all they play is U2  The guy looks  The singer looks like Bono  And they're booked all over the country 
[03:23:30]  World  Yeah they're playing in Ireland  Mexico City  Mexico City  They're going all over the place  He's making more money than he ever has  Playing his own music  Anyone else's music  Doing a fucking tribute band  The fucking thing's freaking me out  Oh right  You keep thinking  You could lunge for a dump  Man  Yeah  You know what  I like when people on regular radio come here  Because they probably go back  And get in trouble  Are you kidding?  Like wait a minute  Oh shit  Bro  You know I got Shazit  I say Shazit  And Fuzuk  Those are my two big ones  And they probably give you a little bit of crap about that 
[03:24:00]  Give me some Trezap  But we can't even say  You know I work for the company you guys work for  And they have their own dictates  Not even the FCC  They're worse  You can't even say dictate  Bro we can't  Bro we can't say masturbate  Yeah  And I had a fight  Because it was a news story  Reading the news out of the newspaper  Dude got caught with the masturbate  We can't say it  This is ridiculous  Isn't that amazing?  And you're fucking in here  It's not  Oh yeah  We're fucking in here  We're having a good old fight  It's not one of the seven words  It's not  Why the hell can't you use it? 
[03:24:30]  Especially in a context that has nothing to do with sex  You're reporting a story  Ridiculous  Well because  You know because they're overreacting  They're scared to death  Yep  They're scared of getting fired  But the greatest thing about Opie and Anthony is  No matter whatever happens to you cats  Are you not the first fucks?  We're the first fucks  No seriously  We're the pioneers of satellite radio  This is forever  I mean this is going to be forever  And you are the  You're going to be in some history  You know how pissed Howard Stern is?  That's the coolest  Then he makes his announcement  And then he's going on the air going  I'm going to be the pioneer of satellite radio 
[03:25:00]  And people called him out  I'm like  Great Pat  Our wagon is on the west coast  We've been panning for gold for months now  That's right  That's it  He's the pioneer  Shut up  What a dick  Jackass  I invented everything  Dig this  I know you know about this  But I'm driving to work  One day  Last week  And I swear to god  I never listened to the cat  But I pushed the button  My station went on commercials  I pushed the button  And I heard that bit  Where he called in  And they had David Lee Roth  You saw it in the paper  And I'm listening to it  The hackiest thing ever 
[03:25:30]  And I'm going  So I came into the station  And I told my friends  I go  Either that was the worst bit I ever heard  And it was the worst  The David Lee Roth guy was terrible  The woman  I mean he sounded like David Lee Roth  But no way he could be that big of an asshole  Because this guy was being  And Stern was being all serious about  Can I say goodbye to my audience  I'm going  Get the fuck  This is  Who's buying it?  Now how do you do that to your own audience  And they're still going to dig it?  Right  I know  That's the part I don't get  Who's buying it?  Very lazy too  It's the hardcore fans  That think it's 1988 still 
[03:26:00]  And you know  But what's that bit?  What was that bit?  They kicked me off the radio  And will you let me say goodbye?  If you figure it out  Let me know  And if you're going to do that bit  You've got to commit  He was on by  What?  An hour  Not even an hour later  If you're going to do that bit  You do it all morning  Let the press run with it  But his ego is so big  He can't  You know  Commit to the bit  Or maybe the David Lee Roth guy  Couldn't carry the show  Well you know  Fake David Lee Roth  Right  By the way  I brought the big dog in today  These guys hate the left  I'm here  Whatever they want to do 
[03:26:30]  By the way  I will tell you this  You know  I just found out  For instance  I heard Penn Jillette  Took a shot at Michael Moore  On some TV show  And it freaks me out  Because they got a great show  On Showtime  Yeah  That beats up the right all the time  I don't understand it  But  How can you guys possibly  I just heard Janine Garofalo  Do the most genius rant  Oh boy  I'm telling you  The broad is extremely bright  I mean she is  Over most people's heads  And that's why she probably  Doesn't have an audience  But she can think deeply 
[03:27:00]  And she has a lot of stuff to say  But I mean  How can you  You guys are telling me  That this George Bush cat  Is not the fake  He's going to go down  As the worst president ever  I promise you  I can't stand him  Well then  I can't stand him  Then you're not a righty  No  But I am far from the left  I  Well it was like you were saying  About Janine  See I got to go  No no no no Jimmy  Look at Jim leaving  Jimmy is the king  Of screaming on the show  That's why I hate  Well let me hear  The left  Give me a minute  I hate Garofalo  I hate her  Why  Because she's a fraud  Oh I don't know this  She's not funny 
[03:27:30]  And if she's  Funny's got nothing to do  With what she's doing  And what I listen to  See she's a comedian though  To me as a comedian  If you can't speak  Through your work comedically  That's what I'm joking about  You're probably right about that  It's very hard to point out  Where she goes awry  To somebody else  Who is very far left  You just  It's the same thing  As the right  It's the same exact thing  As you  Trying to point out  Something wrong  About George Bush  To somebody that is  So far right  They don't want to hear it  Okay here's where I disagree  Let's say we're talking  About O'Reilly  Okay  I can point out 
[03:28:00]  Specific master lies  And proof of the lies  That the guy  Puts on his audience  He's a hypocrite  He's bullshit  Say what  You know  Rush Limbaugh says  On his radio show  That if you get caught  With drugs  That aren't prescribed for you  You should go right to jail  Directly to jail  Do not pass  Until his ass gets caught  You know O'Reilly's doing  Phone sex  It's the right  That talks about  Carrying the family values flag  That's why we hate it  Because Bill Clinton  Got busted for a knob job  Which every other president  Or maybe every other 
[03:28:30]  President was getting  But no see  Now you guys  Write that blowjob thing off  Like it was nothing  It was nothing  Technically it was nothing  It was the trust of the office  Oh that's crap  That was  But no it  But it isn't  But it isn't  The trust of that office  Wait you tell me  I'm worried  If a guy's getting  The knob  No  By Bill Clinton  It could have been  Anything that he did in there  What it was  That's how bad  They were trying to bust him  The guy was bullshitting  To the American people  You mean about the blowjob 
[03:29:00]  Yeah  Come on bro  It's nobody's business  You're allowed to get blow  When you're  Dig this  When men go for power  In the world  Any powerful cat  Why does he want power  To get pussy  This is the truth  That I agree with  The only reason  Why do men buy Lamborghinis  You know  When you become  The most powerful cat  In the world  If you ain't getting  Blowjobs in your office  Then turn in the crown  And you know in France  I know y'all hate France  It's a funny thing  To bring up  But in France  I remember  They were burying  The Prime Minister  About seven or eight years ago  And his mistress 
[03:29:30]  Was at the friggin funeral  And the people  In that country  Which are  You know  They've been around  A lot longer than us  They don't think  A damn thing of it  Because men want pussy  There's a certain dignity  That that office  Needs to uphold  I don't care  That he got pussy  Did Kennedy do it?  No I never cared  That he got pussy  Never the blowjob  Was the issue for me  I never cared about that  You're right  Nixon had a mistress  They all do  My problem was  That when you're called  When you're under oath  You know what  You gotta give it up  Tough shit  You gotta give it up  Why won't you guys  Just say he fucked up  And not just 
[03:30:00]  This is what I'm telling you  Because  I got the man's handbook  When I got born  And my little penis  Popped up  They handed me this book  That says  The only time you can lie  Is when you're getting  A blowjob  That's it  One time  But you know  This is the rule  I'm fucked  I told you not  To bring her up  But you know  Come on bro  You get caught  I mean  You're a good man  Right  Let's just say  You fall off the wagon  And you're getting  A knobber  And your old lady  Hears about it  Right 
[03:30:30]  I know guys  That got caught  In the bed  The wife  Saw the dude  In the bed  Six months later  He got her  Believing it  Didn't happen  It's the man's handbook  You can't  You know  Let me just finish  In all of history  Nobody bothered  The presidents  For getting pussy  Until this friggin  Right wing conspiracy  Which everyone laughs at  Except for the people  That believe it  Which is half the country  Finally busted  This guy for a blowjob  That was heinous  For them to do that  Well how about the left  Sinking everybody  Who's made a politically  Incorrect statement 
[03:31:00]  And then Jerry Brown  I think it was  Jerry Brown  Says nigger  And nobody says  I don't know about this  Of course it was  We have a story here  We were going to talk about it  One day  And Sharpton's like  Well  What's his name  They ran for the Green Party  Oh was it Ralph Nader  Ralph Nader  Okay I apologize  It was Nader  Said nigger  And sometimes  They treated me like a nigger  He was trying to be like  The hip white guy  That could get away with it  But the double standard  On the left  Is just as repulsive  No one called him to task  Even Sharpton came out  And goes  Well he's got a good history  With black people  He's not a racist  Meanwhile 
[03:31:30]  The conservatives said that  They'd be standing  Because we believe  Conservatives are racist  That's what they are in history  Put it this way  You see a guy carrying  A confederate flag  That wants to put  Black people somewhere  That's a righty bro  It ain't a lefty  See but you can  But then we argue  All the time  That the left  Is more racist  Because they're the ones  With the programs  That are trying to  Coddle people  That in their opinion  Aren't as good  As capable  As the people  That need  To care for them  You see that's the whole thing  The righties always say 
[03:32:00]  Everybody can grow up  To be president  You've got to work  Sure you've got to work  But go out in the street  There's crack addicts  All over the joint  The realism in life  Is tough  And you're going to  Have to have programs  If they ever stop  These programs  That the left put together  There's going to be  Riots in the streets  And the left  Would start losing elections  Because the people  That they're giving  These programs to  Would stop voting for them  The left does have  An interest  Just like the right  Has a certain interest  In keeping big business happy  The left has a certain interest  In keeping certain people  In a certain position  Because that is their voting base 
[03:32:30]  You see that's a righty spin  And even though  Maybe let's say  It's a little bit true  Right  I want to be on that side  I want to be on the side  That helps people that are hurt  And that's that side  But is it really helping  People who are hurt  If you condescend  And behave paternally  To people who aren't hurt  I understand what you're saying  Behaving paternally  But it's not  I mean  Look  It's a dilemma  Between  Are you going to help somebody  Or if you're not  I think more people get helped  Obviously  If you get stuck  In the welfare run  Or whatever  And by the way  There's as many white people  If not more  On welfare  Than black  But you know 
[03:33:00]  I mean  It's a tough situation  You know  The right wants to stop programs  I meet people all the time  They say they're conservatives  But only fiscally  That's a bunch of crap  Man  You've got to jump on  On the liberal bandwagon  With causes  And that's what it's about  You know  I'm on the side of  Not bombing people  That are innocent  How about racial profiling  That here's what the left  The left is  The left's irrelevance  To me  Really becomes apparent  When it comes to things  Like they say  You can't look at  Middle Eastern male  Any differently  Than you can look at  Anybody else getting on a plane  And that's just not a fact  I've got to agree with you 
[03:33:30]  You've got to fall into  A couple spots  You've got to move on  You can't go all the way  I mean I know  That there's a reason  Because it's the same reason  That gun guys say  You know  If you take away this  Then you're going to take it  It's the same crap  That's why they do that  Well they use the same argument  The liberals use  The slippery slope argument  The guns use  The people use it too  Well if you remove this right  Well not this right  Let me ask you this  If you're really conservative  This could be the best  I'm not saying really conservative  I'm all for gay marriages  That's right where I was going  Right where I was going  Look if they want to have 
[03:34:00]  Gay unions  Gay parties  I don't care  Look that's more of a church  I personally don't care  There you go  But if they give them  At least the same partner rights  And the same benefits  And the same health benefits  They should get that  Call it what you want  But yeah I'm for that  What about you Ed?  Yeah fine  I'm fine with that  You're not good righties  We never claim to be that conservative  I'm right leaning  Much more so than left leaning  But I look at any subject  That's why a lot of people go  What are you talking about  You're a hypocrite  Or they say  Oh you bush loving righty  Or then they call me  A bed wetting liberal  If I say something else 
[03:34:30]  I take what I read  And you kind of give it  Your own spin  Put your own opinion on it  Get as much of the facts  As you can  And make your own mind up  I don't go with one side  Or the other  Just based on  Hey it's the right way of thinking  Or the left way of thinking  You got to be your own person  It's tough these days  Because you know  With Fox News  And what has happened  The right is so huge  In my mind  Because of all these radio shows  There's like 300 and something  Righty radio shows  All over the country  Now there's four liberal shows 
[03:35:00]  God bless them  But you got to  If somebody checked both of them out  Then they could be real people  See this is where  Like I've dealt with  When I'm doing with Comedy Central  I had to deal with the left constantly  And the content  Of what they allow through  I mean maybe the right would do it too  If they were that involved  In the day to day actions  Of show business  Well give me a for instance  I understand what you're saying  They come to us  They say don't talk about politics  On Tough Crowd  Because Jon Stewart talks about it  On The Daily Show  Then they say don't talk about race  Because Chappelle talks about it  A perfect example  Chappelle could say nigger on his show 
[03:35:30]  Even black guys on our show  Couldn't say the word nigger  It was a complete double standard  With language  With ideology  And again  I'm not saying the right  Doesn't do it either  And talking politics  When you get on The Daily Show  You're always going to get  A left leaning little spin  And sarcasm  Because of Jon Stewart  He's great at what he does  He is very good  But Colin's spin on politics  Is right  And I heard it  But that's why I want to tell Norton  I don't understand  Because whenever I threw down the show  I heard a bunch of righty stuff  They did give us a lot of leeway  With that stuff  But what happened was 
[03:36:00]  When Herzog came back  In the last year  A lot of liberals wouldn't come on  Colin loved having left guys on  He wanted like you know  Margaret Cho  Who of course  She's great on you know  Fucking yapping in the media  With nobody challenging her  But to have another comedian  Go ahead and head  She would have bought on Janine then  Someone would have  I was on the first episode  With Janine  Janine hated the media  I'd like to see a tape of that show  She wasn't  I'm not looking for funny  I'll send you one  But she's a comedian  To me that's her job  That's the asterisk  But we're talking politics now  The show was based on funny first  There's plenty of brilliant liberals  Look Ron Covey  Is as left as you can get  And he's brilliant 
[03:36:30]  There's plenty of guys  Who are qualified to me  To speak to the public  I don't like her smugness  Exactly  And how just because  It's her opinion  And it's a very left leaning opinion  That it's correct  It's not always correct  Well listen  I'll tell you this  You guys probably don't  When you  And people listen to your program  Hope I don't ruin your freaking show  No  We go down this road  I love the bad times  Al Franken's show  And by the way  When he first went on there  I thought it was the worst lingo  But he's gotten a lot better  And the show's entertaining  But on his show 
[03:37:00]  He'll play Rush's clips  And all these guys' clips  And prove  That it's a lie  That's great  He will play the statement  By Bush for instance  That's fantastic  See what I'm saying  And when you hear that stuff  There is no two links  And I think he does a great job at it  Yeah  That I appreciate  Someone that would do  The solution to the blowjob problem  In the office is  We need a female  When she gets power  All she's going to do  Is boss around her husband more  And that's it  The old lady 
[03:37:30]  Who's not old at all  It's nothing  You're going to go to sleep  And wake up  That's it  I promise you  Hey you can bring pictures  Of your insights  By the way  Hopefully you don't wake up  Gagging with a salty taste  In your mouth  Anthony this just in  From ELO  Liberalism is alive and well  On XM 167  That's Air America  Thank you ELO  I hope Eric Logan is listening  Because we would love to have  Wheeze on XM Satellite Radio  We would absolutely love it 
[03:38:00]  Two dudes with chip  By the way  167 is so cool for me  Because I listen to that stuff  And that 167 is left  And like 168 is right  Right  I mean it is so weird  Anthony you should try to  You can listen to it  Go back and forth  Go back  You'll hear the exact opposite  Yeah the same subject matter  Being covered on  Opposite ends of the spectrum  It's like the Karl Rove  Opposites  Yeah  So what are you going to do  There's a lot of people  Checking in  They want to know  How you're doing  Health wise  Because we've talked about it  On the air here a lot  It's good to see you back  I mean I watched Wheeze

[03:39:00]  On his neck  He had no hair in the back  But anyway  I'm going to see  My Chinese lady doctor  And you weren't talking  Like this three months ago  That's why  It's great to hear  Your back  You were barely talking  His tongue  I just want to make it  Clear to these people  It was like just dry leather  He couldn't eat it  He still is bro  Couldn't eat anything  He was getting radiation treatment  Right to his face  Bam  Radiation to the mug  Is a bitch  I'm telling you  Jesus  It's a bitch  From here to here they do  I'm going to show you  Them cats

Like I'm an asshole  Well you're not  You're not  I'm going to blow your cover  Although people are getting pissed  Because I'm not as nasty on the radio anymore  Because I got bored with that  So now I'm trying to show maybe the good side  Nothing wrong with it  See people love me  Trying to show a little more of the good side  But every once in a while  I'll still go to the bad side 
[03:43:00]  A little bit  A little nastiness  But I've got to be honest  They think I'm an asshole  Weiss  Well you're not  And it's too bad  If an asshole works  So you might want to be  You know Stern's all things an act  Maybe you should do an act  We try to be pretty honest on this show  I got that from you  Someone was saying  We try to do the honest thing  That you didn't mind Opie coming to visit you  Because he was more miserable than you were  That's funny  That's funny  That's pretty good  That might have been it  He wasn't ever as miserable as I was  I've loved my friendship with Weiss over the years 
[03:43:30]  Except for the time he almost killed me  But besides that  That's funny too  It's over  Oh right  My nose still rocks and rocks  I know about that  It just moves around  But after watching him go through the cancer stuff  I'm not going to complain as much  Because even though this guy was suffering  Like you wouldn't believe  Not sleeping  None of that crap  Getting the radiation right to your face  He's still doing the video poker online  Well I finally quit  I was going to tell you  I got so sick  I even stopped that  That's when I knew I was bad  Man  But I was pokering for many, many weeks  He was sneaking out and playing poker 
[03:44:00]  In some of these illegal joints  I think I told you about that  One of his joints got busted  My boy went to jail for six days  I don't want to say his name  Wow  Yeah a lot of those places  They're starting to crack down on him  Sucks  You know they had a protest  You guys catch that in the paper?  Yeah  The poker protest  Oh really?

[03:45:30]  Stamped envelope  To the Opie and Anthony show  Attention wow stickers  111 West 57th Street  5th floor  New York  New York  10019  God damn it  What nice hits  XM 202  The Opie and Anthony show  It's Opie and Anthony  The little Jimmy Norton  Anthony discusses  The ridiculous racial stereotyping  Done in good times  After watching a marathon  Of it over the weekend  Yes I did  I remember this  And uh  Yeah I think  Look out  Because the N word  Is used a couple of times 
[03:46:00]  In this  The N word  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony  Uh  Jackie  New Jersey  What's up  Hello boys  Hi  Opie did you see  The Good Times Marathon  On TV Land this weekend  Did they really have  A Good Times Marathon  I spent my weekend  Watching the Good Times Marathon  Opie 48 hours of it  96 episodes  About 500 exclamations of  James  James  It was so  I hadn't watched Good Times  An entire episode 
[03:46:30]  In a long long time  This was a marathon  So I watched quite a few episodes  In a row  That show  Was awful  Just horrible  There was nothing funny about it  Until you watch about  Five or six episodes  Then it becomes  It starts becoming funny  Because it's so bad  The catchphrases  The  Just the storylines  They were all  I can't even 
[03:47:00]  Not say it  Niggers  It was  Let me say  Jimmy  What the hell's wrong with you  It was  And this is why  John Amos  Left the god damn  Show  Because it was just  This stereotypical  Awful  Portrayal  Of a black family  Horrid  Not funny at all  And just  Storylines about  You know  A wino  That they bring  Into the house 
[03:47:30]  And drugs  And  JJ's always  Stealing stuff  And this is all  The stuff I forgot  They had  Remember  Walona  The neighbor  That lived next door  She had a husband  Named Ray  Who left her  Of course  And comes back  A few years later  And tries to get back  With her  And says that  He's changed  Well he's got to  Come in and wait  For Walona  To get back  Because the horror  She's out with the rest  Of the Evans family  And what's her name  There  The daughter 
[03:48:00]  The hell was her name  Thelma  Thelma  She's at home  Doing her homework  Ray comes in  What happens  Ray just pretty much  Attacks her  As she's doing her homework  She's trying to do her work  And he's like  Hey how you doing  Gets right up behind her  Come on baby  In his pimp attire  He's just like a pimp  John Amos left the show  He left the show  After two seasons  Only two seasons  Only two seasons  He left the god damn show 
[03:48:30]  Because of this  Bad  Black  Stereotypes  That were being  Portrayed on this show  Just  Horrible  And nothing funny  At all  The lines  Were so bad  And so predictable  Cornball  I liked  I liked John Amos  He's my favorite part  Of the show  John Amos  Yeah  There was some scenes  Where he was funny  How he'd get pissed off  At JJ  But it just became  A big catchphrase  Like back then  With TV  That was the point 
[03:49:00]  Where it started  You needed the  Happy days catchphrase  You needed the  Stand out  Person that would  Come on  And you'd hear  The woo  From the audience  And then they got  Like every episode  Turned into a special episode  And this didn't take long  In that show  After a year  They weren't handling  Comedy anymore  They were trying to  Cover the issues  That were being presented  To the black families  Of the time  And it was just done  In a horrible  Awful  Stereotypical way  Really bad  I think all shows 
[03:49:30]  Need that guy  That just walks on  And gets the applause  And does a few lines  And then walks off  Oh like perhaps  A neighbor that drops in  Maybe  Maybe a friend  Hey yeah  We have David Duke  Checking in  David what's up  Hey good morning boys  Morning  Just wanted to remind  Anthony that our next  Meeting is tonight  And that he should  Bring plenty of rope  For the after meeting  Activity  Oh Jesus  Why white people  Can't use the word  Take care boy  That was the  If there was any time  A white person  Should use a word  It was when I just  Used it  So shut up  I can think of 655 
[03:50:00]  More appropriate occasions  But that's just  Off the top of my head  Because it was  That's what they were  Acting like on this show  It wasn't  And it was really  The first show  That presented  A black family  As the lead characters  In this show  It wasn't like  All in the family  With the Jeffersons  Living next door  And that was later on  Anyway  This was a show  Based on that  And what they portrayed  Was this bad  Stereotypical  Black family  They lived in the ghetto  But  And then I'm like 
[03:50:30]  They had this one episode  Where this  Building committee  Was checking  All their apartments  And they were going to  Give a prize  For the best apartment  The way it's decorated  And stuff  And Florida was  Putting new slip covers  On the couch  And everything  Yet the refrigerator  Was still filthy  Like they had  Around every painting  That was on the wall  Was like the dirt spots  Like they painted  The set like that  Obviously  To make it look like  The walls  The front door  Around the doorknob  Was just filthy 
[03:51:00]  If they were going to  Clean up the place  So that a committee  Could come in  And judge  How well you're  Taking care of it  Wouldn't you take  A little Formula 405  To it or something  Maybe just clean it up a bit  Only slip covers  Just the slip covers  On there  Another one  This episode  Killed me  And now I'm laughing  Hysterically  At the show  Not with the show  At the show  James  James  He got a letter  That said he was up 
[03:51:30]  For this union job  That was going to pay  $4.50 an hour  And they are talking like  They're going to move  They're going to move  To a mansion  This is great  They're going to get a maid  For James making  $4.50 an hour  I understand the show  Oh it's Formula 409  Thank you  Derek  I made that mistake  Some other time  And someone pointed that out  409  You want to wash out stains  With a freeway in Los Angeles  Give me the 10  I spilled something 
[03:52:00]  I understood what he was saying  That's very funny  Very good  So James is up for the union job  Going to make $4.10 an hour  Or $4.50 an hour  They're going to move on up  And he goes  Well Florida  I'm going for the interview tomorrow  Let's have us a party  And Florida goes  Well James  Where do we get the money?  And he goes  Just use the rent money  We'll have plenty  After I get this job  And I just sat there  And I went  Oh no  I said it  I said 
[03:52:30]  That's called nigger rich  That's called  I remember  My mother or uncle or something  If you get like  10 bucks in your pocket  And run out and spend it  That's what they called it  Being nigger rich  That was the word for it  Welcome to the  Opie and Fat Nick show  No shit man  No these are  Look  If anyone's offended by this  Turn the fucking station  This is just the way  People talked  Especially back then  And it's the way  I'm describing the situation 
[03:53:00]  This was language  That was used  And excuse me  Sorry  It's still being used  There are white people  I hang around people  That use it all the time  That was a term  That meant  You were spending your money  Instead of saving it  And the way it was portrayed  On good times  That's what they were doing  You ever pass a joint around  To your friends  And it comes back to you  And it's all wet  What is that called  You lipped it  Yeah  You know what else they call it  When you spend all your money  And don't pay the rent 
[03:53:30]  Irresponsible  Right  Don't hang me out to dry here  Kids  No absolutely  Speaking of  I am  I am totally  Being honest with the language  This is  This is  This is terminology  Like no one's ever heard this before  Has anyone ever heard this before  You ever heard that term  No  Absolutely  Of course you have  I have never  You ever scream it out a window  No but I've thought it a couple times  I was  Damn fumble  That was never said in my liberal household 
[03:54:00]  That was  My mother would throw that term around  Like it was  Like it was was  And  Yeah  But that was  And of course  Now James  Goes for the job interview  There was some kind of computer glitch  And James  Is supposed to be  41 I guess  In the show  At the time  The age cut off  Was 35  For this union job  And because of a computer glitch  It had him  His age 
[03:54:30]  Being  At 35  And he couldn't get the job  So he's sitting there  And  Gets all pissed off  At the white guy  Behind the desk  Goes back home  They're throwing a big party for him  With the rent money  And he's got to tell everyone  He doesn't have the job  That  Is what the show is about  Every episode  There was just this stereotype going on  A far cry from the Cosby show  Do we have to play this?  Where that awful word would never come up 
[03:55:00]  If you're talking about the Cosby show  Except maybe sexual harassment  That awful word  What is that?  A lot of people requesting  A very, very famous  Opie and Anthony bit  I remember that one  I haven't heard this in years  I made a little slip up on the show  About good times  You certainly did  Want to play this thing?  Yeah  Alright, let's go to the tape  You know, I stole the Playboy

[03:59:00]  Shut up  You'd have fit good in the projects  You'd have to suffer the scrutiny of Michael, the younger brother  Yes  Yes  Remember how angry he was  I don't think Opie would have cut the mustard  His hair and everything  Mama  Why are you dating that white boy?  He's very nice  Now, come on  Let mama go out with Opie  James  Mama, he's the devil 
[03:59:30]  Well, he's showing the devil in bed  Wait till I tell Walona what he did to me  Of course he can't stack up the chains where it counts  You know, this picking on someone is not that fun after all  I always thought it was fun to pick on people 
[04:00:00]  Oh, it's a blast  Come on this side  All right  The Opie and Anthony Show  All right, Bill Burr, reality shows  Staples and comedy  Oh yeah, this was really good  We like Bill  He's a friend of the show  And he's about to make you laugh  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  You have to leave soon?  Yeah, I have an audition for a wacky sitcom at 11  Zain-erific  Anything you could talk about?  Who's involved in the project?  Oh, is there anybody connected?  Attached to it?  Attached to it  That's the word 
[04:00:30]  Anyone attached to this one?  No big names yet  No, no big names yet?  No  This is a sitcom  They never even make it to air anymore  No, not at all  It's got to be a reality show  You took ten guys auditioning for that part  And put it in a fucking house  Had them all lit together  Then it's a show  You guaranteed 16 episodes  Whatever it is  Isn't that just disgusting?  It's  There's nothing really good  But I'm guilty of watching a couple of these  Like the stupid  And the stupidest ones  Like that stupid cooking one  I've been watching the stupid cooking show 
[04:01:00]  With the English guy that yells all the time  And just, you know  Every episode is the same thing  Get on your station  Get back to your station  And then the restaurant goes so bad  That the orders have taken an hour to get out  And he always ends with  Shut it down  And they close the whole restaurant  And kick the patrons out  They kick everyone out  They didn't get their order  It's a big restaurant  That one where they make the customized motorcycles  What's that one?  Oh, yeah  American Chopper  It's the same episode every time  Every single goddamn time 
[04:01:30]  Carburet doesn't fit  What do you mean it doesn't fit?  Doesn't fit  Oh, dad's going to be pissed  From Carburet doesn't fit  Well, why didn't you get the right part?  You guys got to get this part done by tomorrow  Well, maybe if you did something  Instead of just sitting around  I was here until 10 p.m. last night  They're always just yelling  And then they always finish the bike  And then, you know  I was real happy  I was real psyched the way he thought about it  And then next week  Same shit  Same shit  Spark plug isn't going to fit in that  What do you mean? 
[04:02:00]  I watch it every fucking time  Every week  Every week  It's always the same bike  With that big fat tire in the back  You think the father  Spider-Man kind of shit  You think the father could still take his son?  Oh, the  I don't know  They're both  He's fucking old school, man  Yeah  He'd throw a beat with like a crowbar or something  A two by four  Yeah, grab a piece of wood  And hit him with it  He'd get chained to his own family member  That's a fucking old school dude  Is that true?  Gordon Ramsey is on the show on a Monday?  Yeah, we got him  The chef guy from Hell's Kitchen  Hell's Kitchen 
[04:02:30]  Dave in Jersey  What's up, Dave?  Hey, Bill  I just wanted to say hi to Bill  And say I saw his show in Baltimore  About a month ago  And it was an awesome show  Yeah, you and 16 other people  Thanks for showing up, man  It was the show with those idiot girls  Who were in the front row  Who were unwrapping their presents  During the show  You had girls unwrapping  What was it, like a party?  A little shower or something?  Oh, yeah, yeah  The bachelorette party  Oh, you cunt  And they brought the presents to the comedy?  And they were like literally  Having their party  While I was on stage 
[04:03:00]  Working their ass off  20 people  Can you  Oh, my God, Manny  Thank you  That was so sweet  I got some lingerie  From Victoria's Secret  Richard Speck when you need him  Oh, I can't believe it  A dress  You got me a dress  I love a dress  Where'd you get this dress?  It was all those  You know, those little fancy bags  And there's like that fucking  That paper mache  A little paper coming out of it  A little green paper  So that's not too noisy, right?  Oh, Jesus  Horrendous  Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle  Oh, Bill's doing his act  In front of this 
[04:03:30]  Oh, it's tough  You fucking bitches  You guys don't get  You know what's funny  That shit happens so often  I can't even remember  Like, I vaguely remember that  You guys are just shit  On that stage  You're trash to these people  They're going out for a night  They don't care  What you're doing  What goals you have in life  Your act that you work on  To get up there and do  To them, you're just  Blah, blah  Background conversation  Oh, and when you snap on them  They can't believe it  Yeah 
[04:04:00]  The goal  Well, we paid to come in here  I can't  We weren't talking to him  The balls of you  Yeah, it's the way  You were talking  You're fucking interrupting  The whole thing here  Holy shit  This is why I hate audiences  Because you come out  To be entertained  And you never take  Any responsibility  For the fact that  You may not be entertained  Like, sometimes we suck  You know, as Billy will know  Or I know  Sometimes we're bad  But other times  It's their fault  And that table of whores  Would never take responsibility  For the fact that  They probably  Didn't  Hear half his joke  No  He'll yell at them 
[04:04:30]  And they'll go  Well, you're not funny  That's why we're not laughing  It's like  No, you fucking wholes  You're talking  They'll go home  They will go home  And say, you know  Hey, oh, you went to  The comedy club last night  How was it?  Not that funny  The hot girls are the worst  Because no one has ever  Told them to shut the fuck up  In their life  So it's almost like  Guy's fault  That they're like  Such cunts  Because no one has ever  Just stepped to them  We have to take responsibility  For their bitchiness  So they have like  This look like  They can't even believe it  Then they try to get  Like support from other people  Around  And of course  Every guy at the table 
[04:05:00]  Supports them  Because they're still  Trying to fuck them  Stick it in  It's just terrible  Oh  Guys  Yeah, guys are the weasels  They really are disgusting  They just stick up  For these broads  Hey, you know  She's a bitch  She's a lady  Hey, one guy  I was working on my  I was working on a  Tonight show  I said I wasn't cursing  Wasn't cursing  And this motherfucker  From the side goes  Hey, I want you  To tone it down  There are ladies here  Are you shitting me?

[04:06:30]  There's nothing worse  Than when one of those  Fucking wise guys  Tries to act like  I'm a gentleman  Hey, there's a lady here  I'm sorry  You weren't extorting somebody  At the moment  Shithead  A lady here  And then they get out  What the fuck are you doing  You cunt  You almost scratched my fucking car  Get in the car Marie  Get in the fucking car  That's the same lady  He was telling you  To be nice  And breaking a bottle  Over the bridge of your nose  Yeah  You looking at him  You were looking  You were looking  At a fucking nigga  Weren't you  You motherfucker  You  She's a lady 
[04:07:00]  Don't talk to her like that  How many times  Did I say that word today  I don't know  We're all uncomfortable  I'm saying a lot today  For some reason  I'm just throwing it in  What happened to you  I'm trying to desensitize it  Alright  Like Lisa Lampanelli  They say  She's out there  Anytime you do anything  Remotely racial on stage  Whoever's doing like the  Review of your show  They always go  They always bring up Lenny Bruce  Really  The next Lenny Bruce  The next Lenny Bruce  Yeah, 40 years later  Just carrying that fucking torch on  Like dude  You can put the  You can get on the internet 
[04:07:30]  And watch somebody blow a horse  Within fucking three seconds  You're not shocking anybody  You sure can get on the internet  And see that  However, I'd like a link  But Lenny did it in the 60s  And it was real when he did it  I mean he was like  Yes  He got arrested  If you're on stage  Doing like poopy jokes though  You're not really shocking people  In this day and age  Yeah  Lenny was trying to desensitize  He said that  You know  This is just words  I'm trying to take this thing out of them  And he meant it  It was a sincere thing  In 1958 and 60 
[04:08:00]  Right  When you see comics  Doing today  They were trying to be  And stealing just what he said  I've seen people  I'm not going to mention  Any females names  But I've seen people  Kind of stealing the same  Tone  And the same speech  About how this is what I'm trying  That's not what you're trying to do  Right  You're just giving an excuse  For stolen jokes  You're trying to get away with it  And that's your asterisk  You see I'm just trying to  You know what I mean  It's like you see  Yeah  Oh yeah  There's nothing worse  Than the dangerous comic  They always have like  The fucking  Three quarter leather  It's like July  And they got a cigarette  Dangerous 
[04:08:30]  It's the fucking worst  Wow  It's all black guys  Have big dick jokes  And Chinese people can't drive  There's no insight  To any of it  You know who does  And then you tag every joke  What I said it  Yeah  I said it  Yeah  Yeah  We heard you  Nobody  Nobody is shocked  It's just fucking horrendous  It's like  Stop it  All the old staple hack  Like  Supposed to be  These scary bits

[04:18:30]  Just tweaking on his drums  Saying hey to everybody  I annoyed Geezer and Iommi  Like fucking kind of  Stalking him  Outside the tour bus  And I think I scared  Geezer back out of the bus  That kind of does  Annoy people  Yeah  I can't help it  I didn't really stalk him  I just kind of stood there  But fuck him  What were we talking about  We were talking about  Why I hate touring  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  Oh that'll do it huh  What the stalkers  Well I mean  Stalkers  I'm sure that's one reason  Fans  Stalkers  Yeah  What do they  Annoy the shit out of you though  Always asking for something  Pictures  Autographs 
[04:19:00]  That's kind of  I guess you know  If they'd ask  That might be alright  But you know  People running up to you  And sticking a camera  In your face  You know  Really  Yeah  Totally  That sucks  Oh yeah totally  But that's kind of  And they would say  That's kind of  Hey you know  You wanted to  This lifestyle  Of the rock star  Kind of thing  It's kind of  The position you put yourself in  You're going to have to  Deal with it  Hmm  No huh  Yeah  You don't see it that way  No  Well how do you see it then  I play drums  Yeah  That's all I do  That's all I ever signed up for  Playing drums  And the rest of the stuff 
[04:19:30]  Just annoys the hell out of you  Well just  You know  Didn't say on the resume  Be a professional model  You know  Right  Also  Yeah  Didn't see that one coming  Would you rather work for a living  What's that  Would you rather work for a living  Like a real job  Or  I am working for a living  Come on  No I know  I know  Like  I got to come in  And go to work every morning  But  Believe me  This isn't work  I worked at some point in my life  You know  I actually was in construction  For a while  I ran my own custodial business  See 
[04:20:00]  That's what I mean  By working for a living  Obviously you work hard  Playing  And you know  Doing what you do  It's boring  We keep crazy hours  Absolutely  But  Would you rather be  18 hour video shoots  Right  Would you rather be  Installing  You know  Drywall or something  You know  You wouldn't have anybody  Bothering you  He's done it  Yeah  I've done it actually  Yeah  Yeah  That doesn't  It's  That  No I'm thinking  Once this  Rockstar thing is done  I'm going to go back to school  And get an art history degree  Really  Absolutely  I'm working in a museum 
[04:20:30]  That's it  That's it  Curator  I don't mean to laugh  Drywall  Yeah  Back to the drywall  I want to be  I want to be a tour guide  Yeah  Yeah  Absolutely  Maybe at like  At the Wadsworth  Thothenium  In Hugsworth  Connecticut  That'd be hot  Because you're such  A people person  I am  I am  But you know what  You're really  But you know what  Hold on  Hold on  If you're taking somebody  On a museum tour  You don't really have  To be nice to anybody  All you have to do  Is walk around  And tell the people  What they're looking at  Hey  The people that work  In museums 
[04:21:00]  That's P.A. Mondrian  Over there  It was done in 1931  Just hope nobody  Right when he went  Into his boogie woogie phase  Just hope that no one  Wants to take your picture  In front of the Chuck Close  Why would anybody  Want to take my picture  If I'm a museum  Tour guy  Who would care  So they can show  The power of the  Photo realism  Well I would be  Game for that  You know  There's still gotta be  Something phenomenal  This is the difference  Between comics and rock people  It's just gotta be  To get blown on a bus  Has gotta be  The fucking greatest thing ever 
[04:21:30]  Blow  What  Blow what  To get blown  Never have I been blown on a bus  He just did a big gig  In Cleveland  He got nothing  Two shows  It doesn't matter  Two sold out theater shows  And he got nothing  After the shows  I'm not actually sure  What we're talking about  Getting a blow job  On a bus  By a hot  Groupie girl  See once again  We've fallen into  Those rock cliches  And expectations  Of what being in a band  And touring is about  We must all live  Vicariously through  You rock stars 
[04:22:00]  What can we say  Well what is going on  On the rock bus  Everyone assumes  There's a lot of drugs  And drinking  And naked girls  You tell us  What is on the  Not on the mud vein bus  No  What's on the rock bus  Drinking obviously  Alright so the drinking  Is what's happening  And maybe occasional drugs  Alright so we got  The drugs right  Got a Philip K. Dick book  Right now  Really  Reading Valis  Yeah  You get a lot of reading  Yeah  Wow  That really does  Kind of part ways  From the  From the  Naked chicks  Yeah all these  No naked chicks whatsoever 
[04:22:30]  We're crazy to think that  I guess  Yeah the booze and the drugs  Are accurate  But the chicks  You're probably turning them down  That's why you're not  You probably  I don't know if you're married  Do you have a girl  Maybe you're just going  No I don't want to fuck around the road  Too risky  Okay so you don't want to fuck around the road  But you probably could if you wanted to  Actually probably not  Girls don't really like mud vein very much  No  We could probably get as many  12 to 14 year old  Pimply faced boys  That we want  Right Chad  Even better  Sure  Sure  Alright let's say hi to Mike  He has a question for you guys  Mike what's going on 
[04:23:00]  Hello  Go ahead Mike  Hey question for you  You're giving little Jimmy shit  About wanting to take pictures of stars  How do you feel about the people  Who are spending their hard money  To go out and buy your damn album  And not willing to give them  A couple seconds to return  I don't think he was giving people shit  About getting pictures  He was just saying he wanted them to ask  Like just saying  Hey can I get a picture  It's not one of your favorite things to do  Is what you're saying  No I didn't say  I didn't say we don't  Do pictures with people  We do pictures with people every day  And I think what we were mentioning about 
[04:23:30]  Were the stalkers  The people that come out of nowhere  And flash pictures at you  And you don't even know they're there  And they don't even approach you  Or introduce themselves  Yeah  Alright let's say hi to BJ  Not liking that  BJ what's up  Not much  Hey Mudvin how you doing  What's up man  I just had a question  About the whole face paint  And the mask things  That you used to do  How come you guys dropped that  Was it just something that  You helped grew  Got bored of  Who said we dropped it  Or was it when you started doing  The alien faces  It kind of turned into a gimmick  And it was gay  Okay so he just answered 
[04:24:00]  His own question  There you go  We decided that it was just way too gay  And we were going to get out of it  You know  It was just a gaytrocity  Let's go to Frank in New York City  Frank what's up  What's up guys  Hey  Who are these disingenuous  Whining fucks  Who said they'd rather work for a living  Shut up  Get up and get a job  And get up every day  Like the rest of us  I don't think they said  What's your problem  And the drummer  I didn't sign up for this  I just signed up to drum  Shut up 
[04:24:30]  Wow  Sir I take it  You're having a slight problem  Wow  Yeah  The fun show  Good morning  Don't have a good time here  What happened  We were having fun  I hope that you're waking up  To do customer service work  Good morning sir  No I have a real job  And I work hard every day  But anybody would trade their left nut  To have your life  And you're whining  Because you have to take a couple of pictures  Who was complaining  I think he was  Settled down 
[04:25:00]  I think he felt an attitude from you Matt  That's all  You don't sound very happy  With your job sir  Yeah  I didn't sound like  Didn't sound like  And Anthony were kind of like  Pressing me to like  Have some fun  And talk about the job  And maybe  You know say why we didn't want  To wake up this morning  Wasn't that kind of a dig  That we were doing there  We were kind of doing that together  Right  Yeah yeah  I think that's kind of what we were doing  Did we roll into New York  Alright Frank  At 4.30 in the morning  On the bus  Yeah you got to really low this morning  I'm sorry  I'm having a hard time hearing you  Okay thanks  Alright man  There he goes  Yeah well this is coming in a lot though  Seth in Jersey 
[04:25:30]  Hey guys how you doing  Hey  Couldn't be better  I'm like the other guy  I was kind of  I'm happy with my job  But it's just kind of aggravating  When you hear  When you hear a good band  That's been out  Popular  Doing very well  That comes across  When the drummer says  You know  I didn't sign up to do this  You know  I'm just here to drum  Dude  Actually you're here  You know  Your fans pay a lot of money  To come out  Harder than money  To come out  Buy your album  See you  The last thing they want to hear  Is you complaining  Say this is the last thing  I want to do  I didn't sign up  To be a model 
[04:26:00]  Alright  I follow my official apology  I apologize  We were just having a little fun  I apologize  My condolences to everybody that works  I really appreciate people coming to the shows  And it's an honor to be able to be playing NASFest right now  And we love it  You're definitely  But I mean  You're definitely still having fun doing this right?  Of course  Of course  That's why we do it  There you go  There you go  Let's go into some other things here  John in Iowa  What's up John?  Yeah  I just wanted to say  You know  I really like that new album 
[04:26:30]  It's really good  The whole album's great  Thank you  It's been a long time  Since I've heard a real good rock album  But there's a song on there  It's got these freaky little voices  That go  Eeny meeny miny moe  And I just wanted to know  What was behind that maybe  And who did it?  I don't know  I think we  Well the name of the song is Choices  Yeah the name of the song is Choices  And it's  The new CD's Lost and Found by the way  It's that game that every kid plays  You know  Eeny meeny miny moe 
[04:27:00]  So  That's the idea behind it  Is making a choice  And  The  The people on it were  Our producer's children  Yeah it was Dave Portman's kids  He's got two daughters  And a son that came in and did it  Well you did it too with him  Absolutely  Yeah  Alright let's say  Hi to another Chad  Chad what's up?  Hey  Chad you got the coolest name on the planet  Yeah first off  I can attest to the fact that  Matt is a very very kind individual 
[04:27:30]  If you show him respect  Thank you  I really appreciate you saying so  That's all we were trying to say  And you're going to say Chad's an asshole  You know what  I really  I really appreciate you saying so  Yeah  Cause I enjoy meeting people  And I enjoy making friends  I just don't like being stalked  Oh yeah  I completely understand  But I want to know  What brought about the change  Between Lost and Found  And especially  The second half of LD50  Was it just  Personal growth  Or  You know 
[04:28:00]  We've kind of had  We keep an attitude  With our creative process  That  We're not trying to  Recreate a moment  But we're trying to  Find out  Where the band is  At the time that we're writing  So  I mean  I don't know if it's change  Or growth  It's just  You know  Life is  Life changes  And life moves along  And you know  The band's a different band  Than we were four years ago  People do get pissed off at that  Yeah  And a lot  They like to throw out the word  Sell out  A lot  Whenever you do something  And they don't understand  That a band  Is a group of guys 
[04:28:30]  That are  The longer you're together  The more you're going to change  Absolutely  Your ideas change  Your  The gel between the guys  And everything  And you're going to be different  Why does it have to remain the same  You don't want to keep writing  The same record  No  You know what I mean  You'll have just as many people  Pissed off at you  And if you're lucky enough  You'll have the same thing  Over and over and over  You want your music to be honest  I mean that's what we  Really  Really strive for  If you're lucky enough  To be successful long enough  You'll have people  Crawling out of the woodwork  Saying these motherfuckers man  They were great years back  And then  Now they've 
[04:29:00]  Sold out  They've changed  You can't try to meet  People's expectations  Nah  You know  I mean  And I  I always  Felt like  If we  Were smart enough  Maybe we could have been  A pop band  And you know  We can second guess  What people like to listen to  But I don't think  We're that  Quite that smart  I think with us  You know  What our fans have appreciated  Is just the honesty  You know  We just try to make  The most honest music  We can  You  More lucky people like it  You read message boards  Or anything about  No  No  You don't even touch them  I want to do  I want to do  A Mudvane haters  Message board  Yeah  On our site 
[04:29:30]  Because  We already have one  Just to get  No  That's the only one we have  That's the whole thing  Well whenever you have  A lot of people  With message boards  That  For some reason  The people that are  Attracted to that  Are the people that  Really just want to  Bash the shit out of you  Most people don't even  Have anything to say  About Mudvane  Really  It's like  People just literally  Just talking  A lot of infighting  Yeah  Yeah  It's just a strange thing  The message boards  And I  I do know that  Or at least I think 
[04:30:00]  Anybody who has  A message board  Dedicated to them  Or that they're involved  With in some way  Shape or form  Does read  You go to it  At some point  Have you ever read  A post on  A message board  You  On ours  Yeah  Absolutely  Yeah  I haven't  You're  I mean  People tell me  All the time  Yeah  Because that's odd  That you wouldn't  Yeah  You know  A lot of people do  I don't know  Maybe I shouldn't say anything  Maybe I should just  Keep them out  You know dude  If you were  Into your fans

[04:33:00]  Or whatever  And I was literally  Driving around the Decatur Dam  And I looked down  And I saw some people fishing  And I was like  I remembered fishing there  With my dad  Or whatever  And it was just like  Really boring  And like no action  And no fishing  Basically you just sit there  With your line in the water  And every once in a while  You catch a carp  And it'd be like  Woo  Got one on  Woo  You know you'd reel it in  And it'd be like  Oh it's a carp  You can't keep that one  And you throw it back  Because it's got a mud vein 
[04:33:30]  So that's where I came up with it  You know what  I've never heard that story  That's the first time  I've heard that story  Yeah  I've never heard that  I thought it was  I was just driving around the dam  I thought it was the pink laser  Shot from the Sirius star system  That sent the name  Like right top  I burned into my brain  The pink laser  I was driving around the dam  When the pink laser hit me  You were struck by the pink laser  From the Sirius star system  The dog star  The dog star  Let's go to Rich in Ohio  Rich what's up  Good morning boys  Little Jimmy

[04:36:30]  Do you remember  Remember the moment  When you realized  Oh my god  Holy crap  This is going to take off  Yeah  Absolutely  What was it  Was it anything good  Was it hearing it  On the radio  A song on the radio  We've got  We have like  A little bit of  Personal mythology  In the band  And  At a certain point  We  Collectively  Identified a moment  And specified it  And said  This is  The point forever  This is  The now forever 
[04:37:00]  Really  Oh yeah  Absolutely  You had a sign  There was a moment  Where we said  Where we just realized  Like what we were doing  The gravity of what it was  You know  It meant something  In that people  Were probably going to receive it  And we wanted to be  We wanted to be a part of it  It was about six months  Before we got a record contract  And make it  Our whole life  You know  And that's when we  It was all kind of  Absolutely  It got a little bit bigger  Than just us  Like we were saying  In the beginning of the interview  I don't know  I don't want to say 
[04:37:30]  Too much more  Why  Sounds kind of interesting  Well it just sounds  To me like  Devil worship  Sounds like ritual  There's a little bit  Of that ritual  A little bit  Satanic ritual  Sounds like it might have been  A Ouija board  Are we going to get popular  When we got  After we got  A record deal  I was like  Actually we just shook  That eight thing  Yeah the eight  The magic eight ball  I was going to say  It wasn't an eight ball  And it said  And we flipped it over  And it said  Yes  Yes  That was like  Oh my god  I  When we got signed 
[04:38:00]  I at one point  Said I would be shocked  If we sold  150,000 records  Or sold 100,000 records  Like that was not  Going to be possible  And you guys have sold  At least 200  Yeah we actually  You know what  I think we hit  We hit close to two  Didn't we  200  We're getting there  We're getting there  We're working at it  We're still hoping  I'm going to ask you  A question too  Bill Ward  Most underrated drummer ever  He's a jamming drummer  You know what was  Really ridiculous  Like when he's just

[04:56:30]  Well he doesn't do too good  But Jesus  He's the star  Of the bombs and flubs segment  Good point Jimmy  Good point  Thanks Opie  The worst of Opie and Anthony  Brand new bit on the radio show  Thanks to Nathaniel and maybe some of the other guys  I'm not really sure  Oh  Who should get credit for this  No no they're shaking their heads  Uh oh  Oh Nathaniel  They don't want credit for this  They don't want any credit  It's uh  Here's Than  It's a new bit called  Bombs and flubs 
[04:57:00]  Bombs and flubs  Yes people bombing on the show  Yeah  And people flubbing on the show  Flubbing their words  And just bombing with jokes  And what pisses me off  Under the flubs section  Yeah  It's all me  And Jimmy  Because Anthony talks perfectly  No I've had my share  That's for sure  Well they couldn't find one Anthony  It's just what I happened to record  They couldn't find  Uh one example of you flubbing a line  I try  Or flubbing a word 
[04:57:30]  How about pundit  You didn't get that  I know  I know that's a perfect one  That was a good one  That'll be in volume two  Yeah this is  This is the start of a new bit  Which isn't all that far off  Pundit  Pundit  Yeah I must have heard that wrong years ago  And it just stuck  I noticed there's a lot of examples  From last week's show  Did you  Well I did notice  There was a mandate put out  About wanting more of this sort of thing  But yes  It's a lot from last week  You know you've been doing this show  For nine months right  That's what I heard  And you got a week 
[04:58:00]  You know how I know that  Well it's a new bit  So it'll grow from here  Yeah  We'd like to see the beginning  Of some of these bits  And then they take on a life of their own  Right  But here's Nathaniel's  Bombs and flubs  Here's the first bomb  From Anthony  Oh  This was a rape joke  That went horribly wrong  I believe  If you could believe it  He was talking to Paul's wife  Paul's wife  Okay  You know the couple that came in last week  Yeah  And gave us great radio  Alright here we go 
[04:58:30]  Police arrested seven men  Who allegedly kidnapped and gang raped  A married woman  In retaliation for her cousin's affair  With one of the suspect's daughters  What a deal  Wow  One suspect was angered over a relationship  Between his 17 year old daughter  And the victim's 20 year old cousin  So him and his friends got together  And fucked their mom  Okay  I hear she blew the whole thing though  Yeah  By actually accepting it  And just going through with it  It's not rape it's okay  It ruined it for them  Because they wanted to rape her 
[04:59:00]  And she just you know  Agreed with it  And yeah  Where am I going  It was fun just watching you meander  Down that dead end  Out of my peripheral vision  I just see Jimmy's teeth  So I know he's smiling  I'm just  How much longer  Am I going to keep this  Fucking  Scotty what's up  One wheel left on that car  Oh I was working the controls  I was trying to keep that joke airborne  I have no elevator control whatsoever  Nothing  I went in flames 
[04:59:30]  Oh this is great  Oh did that hurt  Bombs and flubs  The next bomb is from our own Ben  Ben  Good old Ben  Made the bombs  I bombed  Jim were you upset that Ozzy didn't play Live 8  Yep  Hold on sir  What  Are you upset that Ozzy didn't play Live 8  No I heard it  I just wanted to bomb twice  He did it again  Oh by the way  Because Jimmy smiled  He goes  What  Like just waiting for him to do it again 
[05:00:00]  So he could turn it around  Oh he wound right up and threw it again  Wow that is really funny  These are funny  When you take him completely out of context here  And throw him in  God damn  This is going to be a great new bit on the show Nathaniel  Yeah good job Booth  Not taking any credit for this  Yeah  Smart move  Alright the next bomb is from Colin  Good old Colin Quinn  Sounds like when Frank used to show up on Carson  Yeah  You know he'd just pop in 
[05:00:30]  Sit on the couch  Talk a little  And then  You think he's going to just slide over  Yeah  And let like George Goebel sit down  And have an interview  No he's getting up  He's leaving  He's too busy  Norton's like Frank too  Frank Gorshin that is  Dead  That's exactly what you should leave on  Wow these are real bombs  This thing is that fucking old man  That's the first Frank reference he can yank out  Guy's been on TV since 1968 
[05:01:00]  This is like a blooper  Or a blooper reel  The gag reel  I like it  Alright  That was my favorite part of Cannonball Run  When they just show the floor  Oh at the end  When they were supposed to say one thing  But Dom DeLuise is blowing a guy  Who's bringing him his food in the room  You're not supposed to say that  Your line isn't  You're so young  And Burt Reynolds goes to tip his cap  And it's his wig  And some skin comes up  Good day to you 
[05:01:30]  Ow  Gets mad and punches the craft services girl  Right in the face  Alright here we go with  Old Jimmy Norton's bomb  This couldn't be a bomb  You had a Y2K joke did you?  I bet you there were big laughs  And they took him out  Probably  In post  You had a Y2K joke did you?  One of the problems that they were saying  Was going to happen  Was that the computer systems  Was going to backdate 100 years?  Yeah  Because the 01 flip  They would have went back to 1901  1900  And I said that's going to be great  It's going to help me in my big court case  What are they going to do?  Prosecute me for having sex with a girl 
[05:02:00]  Who's 114?  Yeah  I had a lot more  No  No  No  That was a good one  Wouldn't that make her younger?  Well it didn't make perfect mathematical sense  Yeah  Because that would have happened  Like right when I got that  It's like if she was 14 in the year 2000  Let's say  If it was then 1900  She's not even born yet  Well let's be happy that you weren't in the audience  Three years I was doing it beforehand  They were talking about Y2K since you know 1971 
[05:02:30]  Yes they were  Wow  Glad I brought that up  How will it affect your pong game?  We'll tell ya  Let's uh  1971?  No  Double bomb  Nice  I piggybacked onto your bomb bit  I was going down in flames  And you decided just to get in the cockpit with me  I was jumping in  Hey it looks toasty in there  I'm a little hurt by the way  Anthony has one bomb and zero flubs  I kind of have two bombs though  I was a bomb in that one  Yeah  My pong joke didn't go over very well 
[05:03:00]  I didn't want to  It was overshadowed by Jimmy's bomb a little bit  But here's uh  Bombs and flubs  Another bomb  Oh Jimmy Norton again  Nah  Keep on to blame  Ah we get it  He's chugling along  Did you get that instant feedback?  Seven more minutes  Play keep on chugling  It was from uh  John F at yahoo.com  John Fogarty  Of course  I got it  Didn't help  But I got it 
[05:03:30]  Did not help  Oh do I suck  You know  When you're live on the air like this  You throw them out  And just hope they connect  And sometimes they just don't  Jimmy  We all understand  We gotta do another one  Nervous  Nervous listeners  Is another one maybe  Oh yeah  Another one that go-getters could take up  Who wants to run with that one  In that office  Huh?  Travis  I've already started to listen myself 
[05:04:00]  Maybe I can hand it off  To one of the other  Oh  Delegating responsibility now  Look at him  One of my inferiors  Maybe  You have  You have  Middle management  Written all over you  Sweet  Alright it's bombs and flubs  Well we could  We could just go to the next one  We'll skip this  What?  Why's that?  What?  There's no skipping  What?  There's no skipping Nathaniel's hard work  What happened?  I'd rather not skip it  I want to hear it  How did you know it was the gay crew 
[05:04:30]  Who just circled  Just circled St. Vincent's  Just circled the Statue of Liberty  And pointed at the Statue of Liberty  And said  That's a woman  No  All these gloom glooms  That was a boat crash  You know what it was?  I should have just enjoyed your  It was taking too long to get to  You were going  Well you're circling  And I saw you going  Oh shit  Well you kind of threw me off 
[05:05:00]  I had a really good line  And then you killed with that line  And then I'm like  Why am I doing this?  In the middle of it  I'm like  Why am I even doing this now?  Why?  Comedy's all about timing  I'm like  I knew as soon as I started  I'm like  Why am I doing this?  Why?  Wow  That is so funny  Having to explain it  And being there all red faced  Oh it's the worst  Oh  I'm just circling the Statues  Statue of Liberty  Whenever you pluralize something  You have to make it singular  I'm hard to cover  Wow that was rough 
[05:05:30]  That was very uncomfortable  We've all been there  We've all been there  Here's another bomb  From British Paul  Is that his name on the show now?  British Paul?  I don't know  Yeah  We're all there  No they just felt like  There was nothing moving them around  Like dead weight?  Yeah  Was it like holding arms  Those thin muscle-less calves?  Two white shoes on?  Fucking nurse shoes?  Useless shoes?  Never  The soles never get dirty?  Pristine sneakers?  Still have that like  New sticker on the bottom? 
[05:06:00]  They're expensive clean  It's like I was imagining that scene from  I'm gonna get you sucker  Where to go and put some legs up  On the nightstands  But they were real  Fuck  You don't know  Fucking Obie just fucked me up  He's describing sex with a lady  That's paralyzed from the waist down there 
[05:06:30]  Alright we got another bomb  From British Paul  Finishing up the bomb section  Of the bombs and flubs bit  So how did you  Did you kind of think like  Hmm this is perplexing  Because if she's numb down there  What the hell am I supposed to do?  If she says that's a huge fucking dick  When it's in there  I'll be like  Hmm  I wonder if she's lying  I love when they bomb  Very good 
[05:07:00]  How did Kev not get any bombs?  Wow  What did you go back a week?  You just went a week  Well because we just  Kind of came up with this thing  Gonna have to really go through  The history of the time we've been here  Drudge up some of those old bombs  Because this is a great new bit  It really is  I like it  There's some  The flubs go back a little farther  Alright  Alright  Now here's some flubs Anthony  From the show  Here's old Jimmy Norton  Jimmy?  The flubs are all  Jimmy and I  That's it  Really? 
[05:07:30]  No Anthony  I know  And no one else from the show  Ant does weigh in on one  And flub in the process  Oh goody  Oh  Can we guess which one here?  No I'm just  Leave it  Alright  Flubs  Eric Logan sent out an ass email  About these tapes  And he said that  She's having a tough time  At the breakup  That might have been better  If I didn't say  He sent out an ass email  Ass email  An ass email  Yeah  I remember that one 
[05:08:00]  That's technically everyone  That Logan sends out  Ah look  You're recouped  Right here  A month later  Alright here's another one  From Jimmy  That's great  Detroit Autowalker  I had Ivan  Ivan Demjeniuk  Was the name I was  I remember  Right right  There you go  Of course  But I couldn't get  Detroit Autowalker  And a Detroit Autowalker  Named Ivan Demjeniuk  Ah did you see that jerk  Yeah 
[05:08:30]  Auto walker  Here's myself  Flubbing away  The bleeps aren't cursed  Are they  No  The bleeps aren't cursed  Yes they are  Stay away from the bleeps  They are cursed  They've been damned  You got a little mixed up there  Happens every day actually 
[05:09:00]  Here's Jimmy  As you're blowing out  Your 80th birthday cake candles  A couple of large men  Come in with gloves  And push your face into it  Until your feet stop moving  What are gloves?  I don't know  I don't know  Sounds that Connor and Lacey make  Oh my god  Hey Flub but came back strong  Wow you certainly did Jimmy  You came back strong  That's been a great joke  Until you're blowing out  Your 80th birthday candles  And men push your face  Into the cake until you die  I don't know what I was talking about  But I'm really proud of myself 
[05:09:30]  Wish I could have got that one out  Yeah  Good one  Conceptually a gem  Back to me  If you want to see the epitome  Of an absolutely  Epitome  Oh epitome sorry  Epitome  Jesus Christ  Oh my lord  Epitome  Yeah I remember that one  Oh  Alright well  Anthony's perfect  So we go back to Jimmy  No I know I got plenty  We were just kidding  When we simulated the home invasion  We didn't really rape his rife wife 
[05:10:00]  Ah fuck  Rape his rife  We didn't rape his rife  We didn't rape his rife  I'd dive a bus  I'd drive a bus  You actually just said it right  I know  I stink  You're stinking  What are we in Taiwan?  What the hell?  God  Waked his rife  I don't know  I was so eager to spit that one out  My little rotten thin lips  Wouldn't open fast enough  You were stumbling through that line  Right from the beginning  You could hear him like  You were constantly trying to catch up  With your tongue  Back to me 
[05:10:30]  Does Flavor Flav and VH1  And everyone realize that  We're off the air in like 15 minutes?  You do know it's Flavor Flav  You know Flav's running a little late  He should be here so  Oh but do you absolutely know it's Flavor Flav  Yeah  With a V  Yeah but that's how they say it in the ghetto  Flavor Flav  Do they say Flavor Flav?  Yeah they get lazy at the end of words sometimes  No it's actually Flavor Flavor  That's why it's Flavor Flav is the cuddle  Flavor Flavor  But you could just say Flavor Flav  I don't know that's been nitpicking a bit 
[05:11:00]  A little bit  Back to Jimmy  Did the soup actually fall into the soup  Or did the part where your mouth goes  Just commit suicide and jump?  I think it was where my mouth goes  Did the soup actually fall into the soup?  Wait did I say that?  Oh my god  Did I say that?  You just said did the soup  Actually fall into the soup?  Well that's a legitimate question  Because sometimes soup will get mixed up  And I hate when another man's soup  Falls into my soup  Did your phone fall into your phone? 
[05:11:30]  Wow  You just don't even know that you did that  No  I just love Anthony  Just the disappointment in his voice  Right after someone flubs  Well I enjoy Jimmy so much  That I want to hear what he's saying  And when he fucks it up  It's taking away entertainment from me  That's right  He's stealing from me  But you also get a little joy out of it  I get a lot of joy out of it  You said epitome 
[05:12:00]  You can't get past that  Well look how it's spelt  It's spelt epitome  I don't want to do this bit  This bit stinks  And I'm thinking  You know I got  I got some outdoor space in Manhattan  Maybe I'll have an alpaca running around  They have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years  So the kid won't be heartbroken right away  Like a goldfish or something  And they look like llamas  Llamas 
[05:12:30]  Llamas  They look like  Jesus  Like a black llama  I corrected myself really fast  Boss would have said  Why?  Jesus  A black llama  That's good  A llama  Yama  Oh this is painful  Back to Jimmy  Because Anthony's perfect  Yeah  I had a bigger ride when Cronkite  Cronkite  Oh  At least you didn't say Cronkite 
[05:13:00]  Cronkite gave a sexier proclamation of JFK's death  Was where I was going  Took his glasses off  That was hot  Yeah  Cronkite  Cronkite  Oh you horrible  Disgusted with himself  Cronkite  That's a good one  Alright 
[05:13:30]  It's kind of like the Cronkite Watergate scandal  Mark that one  Asterisk  Asterisk  In case you need a little reference  That's a flom  I bet you bomb with a flub  Here's another one  One day I'll change it  And just say I grabbed Richard by the hair  And said suck my cock bitch  Suck my cop  Cop  Jesus  Forget it  In a bit  Suck my cop  Yeah  Yeah 
[05:14:00]  Yeah  Can we put a sound on that car?  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  Oh dear lord  And finally  The last bomb and flub for today  Who is it?  It's not you  Give me an H  Give me a Y  Give me an S  Give me a T  Give me an R  What's it spell?  The beginning of hysterectomy  Hysterectomy?  Hysterectomy  Is it H  E  No H Y  H Y 
[05:14:30]  S T  S T E R  You said R  S T E R  Yeah you said S T R  You sure?  I'm positive  Play the tape back  I'm pretty sure I said E R  No you fucked up  I certainly didn't  Hysterectomy  I'm sorry you'll have to get a hysterectomy  But did you hear the way I bailed out?  I didn't feel like spelling out the entire word  Of course  Especially after  Leaving out a letter  Hysterectomy  Hysterectomy  That's not bad at all  A little comma in there 
[05:15:00]  Just take that letter out  Let's say hi to Andy in New Jersey  It sounds friendly  Andy  Yo what's up  Hey listen  Anthony does mess up  Every time he says finger  Younger  Finger younger  Stop it  Finger  It's good that you picked those two words to put together too  Finger  Younger  Nathaniel bravo  Good job  Thank you  Yes  The first installment of Bombs and Flubs  How come there's no enthusiastic applause coming from the booth?  It's weird  Yeah what?  Anyone want to take any credit now? 
[05:15:30]  For a little help?  No  Oh to be honest  It's cute  They're a little jealous  I think so  There you go  Alright  All yearning  Like puppies in a basket  When you take one out and pet it  They all look like  Why aren't you petting me?  That's right  The O.B. and Anthony Show  O.N.A. TV edits  And what?  No no  I said no  Go ahead man  I said we're sitting here  It's us and it's Eric  Young Hawk  Who hasn't been addressed yet 
[05:16:00]  His awful eating habits  Fucking  Have a turkey with rubber cement on it  Fucking  Shit  He's awful  He's eating less mayo  Leave the kid alone  Yeah I know  He switched it to fucking cream cheese  And he just shovels it into his mouth  He's not happy  Unless he actually  Can't breathe  Unless he swallows  That's how he likes to eat  It's a borderline suffocation  Jesus  But what are you doing 
[05:16:30]  What happens when you hear about a SIDS death  That makes you hungry  Alright Jimmy  Chew to live  Chew to live  Chew to live  Swallow  Yeah we go  Open the air hole  Sucking mayo out of a packet  Watching your life wither away  Fucking child hearts  Oh god  ONA TV edits on the worst of Opie and Anthony  Ruthless  Oh god  That's wonderful 
[05:17:00]  That was a lot of fun  Yeah right  Hack it up  I've had it  I thought you said hack it up  I'm like well we did  I can't believe we got paid for this shit  To be honest with you  Hey Eric  Can I have a little envelope to carry my signed  Howie Mandel picture  Yeah exactly  He would be fair if he ripped it up in my face  And just belted me  Anyone else have a money clip I could borrow  This one's full  Yeah  No  No  Maybe you should just have those ones 
[05:17:30]  You don't have extra money clips laying around it  With your big wad of cash  This is a gap in a spark plug doll  That's funny  He's done doing his belt  Thanks Phoebe 
[05:18:00]  Jesus  Oh wow  Oh we got XM satellite radio  Opie and Anthony bags  More practical marketing  That's great  Listen when people are shopping up here  What the fuck we got shopping bags for  This is in case you're diagnosed with intestinal cancer  And you need something to shit into  Feel free to think of our program  You're fucking dropping a liquidy shame filled dump  Sound like stew being dumped into a pool  You know one of those shits 
[05:18:30]  You're happy if you see anything solid like a piece of onion skin  The old piss out the ass  Sounds like a girl taking a leak  All right kitties  Why do you always go home man?  Can we hang out?  Because I like home  He likes home  It's Friday for God's sake 
[05:19:00]  Wow 20 after already?  How come 20 minutes flies by after the show?  But if we're having a shit show  That 20 minutes takes fucking two hours  Thanks for fucking ever  All right later I'll see you Monday  It's the worst  We're going to do an ONA TV edit thing  Yeah I want to hear this  This is Jimmy  Jim Norton talking to Dragon Wagon I think 
[05:19:30]  The famous Dragon Wagon bit  Yeah  No no no no  What?  Oh Hawk  Oh Hawk  What have you done?  No they said they might go with the other one  This is uh  But it's Hawk's fault  It is  It always is  It is  I'm always taking mics away from the guests  Eight people walking in here while you remove a mic from an anchor  Uh  Here you go  Hold on  No but that's his son  Show respect to his son  Talk it to mine  Mine sir  No no talk it to mine  All right  So the Dragon Wagon was a little too  Dragon Wagon was a little too long 
[05:20:00]  And didn't have enough variety in the language  So we went with a different bit that Danny selected  What bit is it?  Oh look at it  Now wait a minute  That just was very telling  I know what that is  Nathaniel is not confident in this  At all  I have the utmost confidence  No you said which Danny chose  But there's some you know  Discussion as to  Who contributed to what  And not people not getting credit  And I think Danny  Selected an excellent bit  You would absolutely not give Danny credit  No  You wouldn't say you did it  If he didn't do it 
[05:20:30]  But you wouldn't step up  And actually give him the credit  I have the utmost confidence in this  All right  What's the bit?  It's a Jim yelling at a caller  That just said he wasn't funny  Oh okay  Okay  And it's done in the TV edit style  You know how they put movies on regular television  They've got to edit out the language  And a lot of times they use ridiculous words for the curses  The voice is different  The ambient noise in the background is different  And it's ridiculous  Right  And we just decided to try one of these with a little segment of our show  All right  Here's Jim Norton 
[05:21:00]  The original line  Wait  Nathaniel  Oh you killed him  Nathaniel wanted to say something  Did he?  No that's okay  Oh he was going to talk to the microphone  Fuck your ass  But he was going to talk to the mic  You got me so bad  No he actually was trying to talk into the mic  And he got shy and he walked away  All right  Here's the original  All right  Dialogue  Hey guys how you doing  Long time listener  Glad to have you back  Jeff welcome to the program  Hey uh  Gotta tell you  You gotta get rid of Norton  Dump this guy  Because he sucks  What? 
[05:21:30]  Uh oh  That was the first line  That's the first line  And now we're going to clean it up for  TV  Wow  Steve you have confidence in this?  Green Goblin face made a really good choice in there didn't he?  Dumbbell  Did you have picked one with profanity in it Daniel?  All right  It's just the first one  But the whole point is  You gotta clean it up  And there's nothing wrong with  I'm thinking sucks  All right Steve  Explain yourself  We used  We used  If I may make a local reference 
[05:22:00]  Channel 11  Uh uh  Rules  Where they couldn't use sucks  Can't use sucks  All right  Let's listen  To the original  All right  One more  I just got confused  Because I didn't know what they were going to  Redo here  Hey guys how you doing  Long time listener  Glad to have you back  Jeff welcome to the program  Hey uh  Gotta tell you  You gotta get rid of Norton  Dump this guy  Because he sucks  What?  All right  So that's the original  What a dope  I am greeting him happily  Yeah I know  Asshole  You feel stupid  I hope he's dead  And here's that same line 
[05:22:30]  Cleaned up for channel 11  Local broadcast  Hey guys how you doing  Long time listener  Glad to have you back  Jeff welcome to the program  Hey uh  You gotta tell you  You gotta get rid of Norton  Dump this guy  Because he stinks  What?  All right  I kind of like it  It was very good execution  By the way  The sound was a little off  The voice wasn't the same  But his attitude was the same  You try to actually 
[05:23:00]  Get the guy's  Angry attitude  This is actually a lot harder  Than you'd think  Because you have to sit there  And say it  Uh  Exactly how Norton delivers  The line  God damn it  All right  Forget it  You really need to explain  Jesus  All right here's the  My motivation was  I know  Every time he opens his mouth  He drains the funny  From the room  Whoa easy there Jeff  I gotta tell you 
[05:23:30]  Hey Norton  Bob Kelly was on the other day  I couldn't tell the difference  Between him and you  Get a new shtick buddy  You stole it from him  You're a one trick pony  Yeah your mother's  A one trick pony too  When I give her money  She sucks my dick  And eats my ass  You fucking fan  With an opinion  Your mother's a trick turning pony  She sucks horse cock  While bad 70's music plays  Little troll  God Jim's just proven  That he's actually funny there  Wow  That's not really  What I meant to say

[05:25:00]  And everything  Bad that don't make sense  What did I say last one  Your mother does what  With a pony  The final  I forgot  Fern  I think there was a fern  In there too  Yeah there's a fern reference  Fern  Wait I can play the last  Yeah  You know these Denons right  You can play the last  Five seconds  Of the track  No  It's your still records  Every time he  You flippin' fern  With an opinion  Your mother's a tried and true pony  She sings punk rock  While bad 70s music plays 
[05:25:30]  That is really good  Sings punk rock  That's really good  If I had any real sense of humor  That's what I would have said  To begin with  Yes  That would have shown him  Alright let's  Here's the original line  There's more to this bit  You are an unfunny little troll  That's the best you have  Unfunny little troll  I say your mother sucks pony dick on film  And you call me a troll  Do I trip trap under a bridge  Drop dead motherfucker  Alright let's see how Steve cleaned this up

[05:27:30]  Hey my mother may take it on the face  But at least she's funnier  Than you motherfucker  She's not funnier than me  The only thing funnier about her  Is she's a woman with a cock  That's what's funny about your mother  And she dangles in all of your father's face  Like a Roman war helmet  How the hell are you going to clean up this one?  Oh my goodness  This was the most challenging bit  We had  Nathaniel and I both did VO parts  In this one  I may stink  But your mother swallows flies  And shaves her face  My mother might shave her face  But at least she's funnier than you  Mike Foxtrot  She's not funnier than me  The only thing funnier about her 
[05:28:00]  Is she's a woman with a beard  That's what's funny about your mother  And she's dangling in all of your mother  And she's dangling in all of your father's faces  Like a rug from Persia  I like Nathaniel  I had to play the part of the angry caller  Anyone else pick on that?  Very good  Very good  All right, we're running out of show  We want to get to the end of this  The original dialogue  You're the worst, man  I may be the worst  But I'm well paid  And you're a listener  So sit there, boy  And listen  Put on your headphones

They're off the air  They're not off the air  They're off the air at 10  10 o'clock  Oh, they're off the air at 9  At 9?  Yeah  5.30 to 9  And they're still there?  Jeez, Opie  Oh shit, what's that about?  What's going on?  They're taping things for tomorrow's show  At 45 minutes after their show is over?  It's unheard of  I'm already sleeping  I am so home  We might want to look into this work ethic 
[05:32:30]  Yeah  How you doing?  Perhaps  I actually do stuff after the show  I didn't know you guys came off the air at 9  I apologize  I was  I thought it was a 9.30 call  I'm on the Opie and Anthony program  Shut up  God  I am in the studio  They do have very nice studios, yes  Listen to them  Fucking heck  Where are you guys in D.C.?

I'm not sure what you mean  Okay  State Theater  703-237-0300  Hey, thanks guys  Take care  I don't know  No, it's not sold out  It was sold out after the Stella Leno appearance  But they actually reconfigured and added seats  Speaking of sold out  So, you know, come on down 
[05:33:30]  We're going to be giving away some tickets and shirts  Yeah, back it up  You're the worst  Well, the last comic standing thing  They didn't discover anything in my past at all  That whole Megan's Law thing wasn't  LOL  No, it was actually a  It was actually a conflict with an MTV contract  I had signed something with MTV  And I would have had to breach a Viacom contract  And you know how thin it is  Are they asking him why?  They're asking him why he wasn't on  The last comic standing  Well, I do a lot of pedophile humor 
[05:34:00]  I don't know how long that would have lasted on NBC  But I mean, you know, so far so good  But I kind of knew I was going to have to leave in Vegas  What's that?  What Michael Jackson trial?  Oh yeah, they did a good job with that actually  Leno was very funny with the Michael Jackson  Oh, God  They're talking about the Michael Jackson trial  That's good  Can I get a bowl for you?  Yeah, I would have been very happy to do that  To, you know, just stand there shirtless  In a little pair of tight-fitting shorts  Maybe a nice Viagra rod  Can we say that on commercial?  I don't remember  Okay, cool 
[05:34:30]  I don't remember  You know, this job has ruined it for us  Good, things are great  I mean, we're on XM  We're on, which is great  Because, you know, people can listen to you guys in the morning  And then listen to us in the afternoon or at night  Whenever they want  They replay us 24 hours  And, you know  Jimmy  He doesn't mean that  Stop it  It's phenomenal, dude  It really is phenomenal  We get a 24-hour replay  We can say whatever we want  And it's just great being back on the air  We were off for 26 months, which sucked  Raising brand crunch, Opie?  No, just 
[05:35:00]  What do you got?  Granola  It's been great  I mean, you know  We have, you know  It's just getting better and better  We're syndicated nationally now  Which is just kind of weird  To get calls from Oklahoma  And all these places  And, you know, myself and Eric Nagel  Have just been on tour  I mean, that's pretty much what we've been doing  Yeah, I mean  I've done  I'm doing Cleveland  And then D.C.  I'm not doing too many cities  So I've got to go out  And start shooting the series  For HBO in August  I'm going out there  It's the Eric Nagel project, actually 
[05:35:30]  Which is on HBO  We just don't know exactly  That's what the working title is right now  Well, I'm not the star of it  It couldn't be the Jim Norton project  Eric Nagel is this  Like, he's this really weird guy  He plays this, like, bisexual  Incompetent radio guy  Believe it or not  And, I know  It sounds odd  But he's actually the star of the show  So, I mean  You know, we'll see how it goes  We start shooting in August  We're shooting in L.A.
